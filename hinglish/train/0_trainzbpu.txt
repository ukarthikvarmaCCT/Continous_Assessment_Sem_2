 ek ore to piem modi desh main lagu saikadon kanoonon ko khatm kii pahal kar rahe hai to duusari ore unke hi mantri kuch nae kanoon laane par amada dikhte hai
 Now the Health Ministry is talking about a change in the law to ban the sale of open cigarettes in the country
 ek visheshgy panel ne desh main tambaakoo par roak lagane ke liye kade kadam uthaane kii sifarish kii he jisamen ek yah bhi he ki khule cigarette kii bikri par pratibandh lagaaya jaae
 Similarly, another recommendation is to increase the minimum age to buy tobacco-cigarette from 18 to 25 years
 inkaa ulanghan karne waalon ko jurmaana chukaana padegaa
 The panel's recommendation is influenced by the World Health Organization Convention stating that the sale of open cigarettes should be discouraged
 iske peeche tark yah he ki bachche khule cigarette kharidne ko aakarshith hote hai
 The new government has waged a war against tobacco which should be welcomed
 lekin phir vahi sawaal uthta he ki kya kanoon banaakar koi buree aadat dur kii ja saki he? sharaab kaa hi mudda le lijie
 Many states imposed prohibition and enacted stringent laws
 lekin kya hua? maharashtra, andhra pradesh, haryana vagairah sabhi ne apane yahaan sharabbandi kii jiskaa koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 Inverse crime increased
 sharaab kii taskari karke paise kamaane main lage log baad main aam kism ke aparaadh karne lage
 Similarly, there was a law to set an age limit for purchasing liquor
 uskaa kya hashr ho rahaa he, yah sabhi jaanate hai
 Till now how many sellers or buyers have taken action under this section? In fact, when such laws are made, their implementation is very difficult and even the police is unable to do anything
 ulate yah bhrashtachar kaa kaaran ban jaataa he
 The policemen start recovering and then the business goes on
 khule cigarette kii bikri ko sarkaar rokegi kaise?ise rokane kaa kaam to vahi police karegi jiske paas pehle se hi kaam ko boj he
 Will the government ask him before enacting such a law? After all, how will she implement it? Cigarettes are sold in every street and every locality of the country
 in par kaise najar rakhi jaaegi? lakhon log cigarette-tambaakoo or paan masala bechakar apana jivan yaapan kar rahe hai
 Now the government is going to give the police the right to recover from them
 yahaan ek baat samajhane kii he ki beshak kendra sarkaar kanoon bana de, uskaa paalan rajya sarkaron ko hi karnaa he kyonki kanoon-vyavastha rajya kaa masalaa he
 In many states, the law and order situation is so bad that there are frequent discussions about them
 aise main vahaan is tarah ke kanoon lagu karne kii baat karnaa bemaani he
 Law should not be just for books, it should also be followed
 behatar hoga ki us kanoon kaa paalan karwaane waalon se poocha jaae ki kya yah sambhav hoga
 After all, they will have to take up the task and when the law is such that it belongs to every street and every locality, then they must be thought of before implementing it
 kisi bhi saamaajik buraai kaa ilaaj kanoon nahin ho saktaa balki jaagrukta se hi use dur kiya ja saktaa he
 The only solution is to make the public aware of its tragic consequences
 jis tarah se pataakhon ke khilaaf bacchon main jaagrukta failaai gai usase hamen sikh leni chahie
 This created a lot of awareness among the children of the country and on a large scale, children stay away from firecrackers today
 yah baat har buree aadat par lagu hoti he
 It is not possible to solve such problems by making laws
 behatar hoga ki sarkaar isaki bajaay ek bada jaagrukta abhiyaan chede

 Thirah Suhagin women are given a farewell by putting a dot on their forehead and giving them items of honey
 aadhunik yug main pati bhi rakhane lage vrathkaravaa chouth ke din ab patni hi nahin pati bhi vrath karte hai
 It is an extension of tradition
 karvaa chouth ko ab safal or khushhaal daampaty kii kaamana ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 Karwachauth is no longer just a folk tradition

 Karva Chauth Kathapahli Katha: After fasting for the whole day, women are ready for worship in the evening
 aas-pados kii mahilaayein ek jagah ikatthi hoti hai or saath main karwachouth kii katha sunati hai
 The story of Veeravati is most prevalent for this
 darasal, rani viravati saat bhaaiyon kii akeli bahan thi
 After marriage, when she came to the brothers, she kept a vow one day
 haalanki unhen is kathin vrath ko nibhaane main kuch mushkil ho rahi thi, lekin unhen chandramaa nikalne ke baad hi kuch khaanaa tha
 In such a situation, his suffering from his brothers was not seen and he fraudulently broke his fast
 jaise hi viravati ne khaanaa khatm kiya, unhen apane pati ke biimaar hone kaa samachar mila or mahal pahunchane tak unke pati kii mrityu ho chuki thi
 After this, on the advice of Goddess Parvati, she duly completed Karva Chauth and brought her husband's life back
 duusari kathathkaravaa chouth ke vrath kaa ullekh mahabharat main bhi miltaa he
 Draupadi sought help from Lord Krishna to overcome the persistent troubles on the Pandavas, then Shri Krishna told him about the fast of Karvachauth, which was kept by Goddess Parvati according to the methods of Lord Shiva
 kaha jaataa he ki is daupadri ke is vrath ko rakhane ke baad na sirf pandavon kii takaliphen dur ho gayi, balki unki shakti bhi kai guna bad gai
 Third Story: The fast of Karwachauth is also associated with the story of Satyavan and Savitri
 is katha ke anusaar jab yamraj satyawan kii aatma ko lene aae, to savitri ne khaanaa-pinaa sab tyaag diya
 In front of his stubbornness, Yamraj had to bow down and he returned the life of Satyavan
 chauthi kathathek samay kii baat he ki ek karvaa naam kii pativrata stri apane pati ke saath nadi ke kinare ke gaanv main rahati thi
 One day her husband went to bathe in the river
 snaan karte samay vahaan ek magar ne uskaa pair pakad liya
 The man started calling his wife by saying Karva Karva Karva Karva
 uski aawaaj sunakar uski patni karvaa bhaagi chali ai or aakar magar ko kachche dhaage se baandh diya
 After tying the crocodile, she reached Yamraj and started saying to Yamraj, 'O God! But my husband has caught my leg
 us magar ko narak main le jaao
 'yamraj said,' yet the manger is still alive, so i cannot kill him
 ’ is par karvaa boli, ‘agar aap aisa nahin karoge to main aap ko shraap dekar nasht kar duungi
 Hearing this, Yamraj was frightened and came with that loving husband Karva and sent Magar to Yampuri and gave longevity to Karva's husband
 he karvaa mata! jaise tumne apane pati kii raksha kii, vaise sabake patiyon kii raksha karnaa

 Hindustan has been the target of terrorists from the beginning
 lekin isi kadi main ab duniya ke sabase badnaam aatankwaadi sanghathan iesas kii ek aisi saazish kaa khulaasa hua he, jo agar kaamyaab ho jaati to samaj lijie ki hindustan main badi tabaahi much jaati
 Countless people would have lost their hatred and bloodshed
 balki desh ke dushmano ko hamen kamazor karne kaa mauka mil jaataa
 However, just before Independence Day, August 15, the country's security agencies not only exposed this terrorist plot, not only shaken the enemies, but also saved the lives of many innocent people
 to akhir kya thi ye saazish? or kaise hua iskaa khulaasa? aapako bataate hai kya tha- oparation green bird
 Hindustan is the 'bird of terror'
 rajdhani dilli samet kai shaharon par khatar ke badal mandara rahe hai
 ISIS has created a new plot of terror
 jiskaa khulaasa telegram app par bane group se hua he
 The planning of the explosion has been revealed just before Independence Day
 akhir kya he ISIS kaa oparation green bird?saazish number 1- bengali 138, saazish number 2- islamic hind, saazish number 3- flames of war, saazish number 4-al-mutarjim foundation or sabase akhir main sabase badi or sabase sabase kaufanaak saazish number 5 yani green bards
 Now you must be wondering, what are these pages of Telegram app, what does it mean and what are the things written in these pages of intrigue that have caught the attention of security agencies? So let us tell you the whole story in a silly manner
 ek to aatankwaad ke khilaaf sarkaar ke zero tolerance kii niti, doosraa jammu-kashmir se dhara 370 kaa khaatmaa or teesraa jashn-e-azaadi yani swatantraaa diwas kii taiyaari karata hindustan
 These are the things which have dwarfed the enemies of India
 wo har haal main kahin naa kahin gadabadi failaa kar begunaahon kii jaan lenaa chaahate hai
 Want to make India cry tears of blood
 lekin isse pehle ki ye aatanki aise kisi mansoobey main kaamyaab ho pate, hindustan kii suraksha agenciyon ne iesas ke oparation green bird kii hi gardan marod di he
 But, the question is, what is ISIS Operation Green Bird? What does it mean If the secret of Operation Green Bird does not open in time, what could have happened? So in the incident today, we will disclose all the secrets of this Operation Green Bird one by one
 sabase pehle aaie saazish ke telegram massej ke chand pannon ke bare main aapako bataa dete hai
 The security agencies of the country monitoring and pursuing every act of terrorists suddenly noticed on 29 April this year a telegram group of ISIS which was created by this terrorist organization in a very intelligence manner
 is group kaa makasad naa sirf hindustan par hamale ke liye aatankiyon ko taiyaar karnaa ke saath-saath unhen is kaam ke liye recruit yani niyukt karnaa bhi tha
 Needless to say that for this, the terrorists were not only revealing their entire conspiracy in the same group in a conspicuous manner, but in putting that dose of poison against the non-muslims in the hearts and minds of the people, Which was not so easy to overcome
 or yahi vajah he ki bengali 138, islamic hind, flames of war se lekar green bards jaise group ke memberon kii taadaad lagaataar badhati ja rahi thi or saazish ke taar bhi gahraate ja rahe the
 But on this occasion, the conspiracy of ISIS exploded
 aatankwaadiyon ke ye group to kair apana kaam kar hi rahe the, lekin aise hi ek group main jab aatankwaadiyon ne pehali baar laal kile kii ek aapattijanak tasviir pesh kii, to suraksha agenciyon ke kaan khadey ho gaye
 In this picture, the terrorists not only talked about attacking the Red Fort soon, but also wrote that soon India will be made a part of the rule of Islam i
e
 Khilafat
 asal main in grups main aatankwaadi code language kaa istemaal kar apni baat rakhte the, taaki saazish kii baat aam naa ho
 Moreover, he also used to take care that no other person or informant of the police would become a member of his group by deception
 lekin akhirkaar vahi hua, iesas ko jiskaa dar tha
 De-code became a code for terrorists! Indian agencies finally decoded the code of Operation Green Bird
 is code ke mutabik green kaa matlab bharat ke teen shaharon dilli, bhopal or trivendrum se tha
 While Birds was written B1RDS, instead of Eye, one was written
 or isamen bi-1 matlab tha rail kaa coach number bi-1
 r meant Rajdhani Express
 jabaki dies kaa matlab tha dilli south
 According to this, ISIS terrorists were going to detonate through IED in a B-1 coach of Rajdhani Express or a train passing through Nizamuddin in South Delhi on August 13, just before August 15
 iske liye iidi banane se lekar mobile phone ke zarie unhen datonet karne yani bam phodne kii puri training aatankwaadiyon ko di ja rahi thi
 But before this could happen, the security agencies not only destroyed their secret, but also saved countless innocents from being killed

 Veteran Indian batsman and ICC World Cup-2015 brand ambassador Sachin Tendulkar said on Wednesday that the International Cricket Council (ICC) limited the next World Cup to 10 teams is like 'going backwards'
 isisi ne pichley varsh disambar main kaha tha ki 2019 ke vishwa cap main keval 10 timen hissaa lengi
 Since then, the ICC has been constantly criticized
 sachin tendulkar kii aatmakatha hindi main launccricket austrailia (sie) kii website ke anusaar jari vishwa cap main sambhddha tiimon jaise ireland or afghanistan ke prabhaavshaalee pradarshan ko dekhte hue kai cricket prashansakon ne isisi ke faisle kii aalochana kii he
 According to Tendulkar, reducing the number of teams in the World Cup will have a negative impact on the campaign to promote cricket globally
 tendulkar ne kaha, 'isisi kaa faisla thodaa niraashajanak he
 As a cricketer, i want the game to be recognized more globally
 isisi kaa faisla peeche jane kii tarah he
 Apart from reducing the number of teams, we should think about how we can further promote small teams
 'gauratlab he ki kai maukon par choti tiimon ne vishwa cap main bade ulatpher kiye hai
 In the same World Cup, Ireland was shocked by beating West Indies last month
 ireland ne 2011 main england or 2007 vishwa cap main pakistan ko bhi haraaya tha
 Similarly, Kenya also defeated 1996 World Champion Team Sri Lanka in 2003
 tendulkar ne kaha, 'choti tiimon ko badhaava dene ke liye jaruri he ki austrailia, newjiland, bharat, dakshin africa jaisi timen apni duusare darje kii tiimon ko in sambhddha sadsy deshon ke daure par bhejein or shrinkhlaayein khelen
 The advantage will be that we will get 25 teams to play in the World Cup, not 14
 'tendulkar ke anusaar agar achche nattejey milte hai to isse cricket ko vishwa str par or zyada prashansak milenge
 Tendulkar hoped that the ICC would take note of it

 ''is kaarykram ke rajya sanyojak tathaa bieme ke umang ke rajya samanvayak gajendra nautial kehete hai, ''bieme or plan kii ore se uttarakhand ke doordaraj ke ilaakon main deb dashak pehle bal panchayat kaa gathan kar bacchon se jude masalon kii pairvi kaa kaam shuru kiya gaya
 It was from these panchayats that the issue of resorting to media approach arose
 2005 se is kaary ke liye bal panchayat se patrkaar banane vaale kishoron kaa chayan kar umang group kii shuruyaat kii gai
 Today there are 3,250 child journalists working in 130 Bal Panchayats across the state
 ''panchayaton se chune gaye kishoron ko patrakarita ke gur bal patrkaar hi sikhaate hai
 For this, 72 child journalists are trained as instructors in every field of journalism in the entire state
 gairsann main umang kii kor group member nirmala bataati hai, ''kor gurp kaa sadsy banane se pehle samachar, feechar, kahani lekhan or comics nirmaan kii baarikiyon kaa gyaan karaayaa jaataa he
 Apart from this, photographing, video and audio clips are also taught
 ''umang masik patrika kii sampadak deepa jhkvinn group kii ore se bacchon dwaara media madhyamon ke upyog ke tareeke samajhane ke liye thailand kii rajdhani bangkok kii yatra kar chuki hai
 These children are also called for training to prepare child journalists across the country
 november, 2011 main rudrayag se renu sakalani or paudi gadhwal se anjana juyal ne cambodia or ghana main prashikshan kaarykram main hissaa liya
 Deepa has also received an offer to work on a desk from Rajasthan Patrika in Jaipur
 umang group sanyukt raashtra bal adhikaar samiti ke saamne bhi bacchon se jude sawaalon kii pairvi kar chukaa he
 Members of the core committee of this group have presented their report twice to the United Nations Children's Rights Committee in Geneva
 gajendra nautial bataate hai ki pehali baar geneva jane vaale bachche lakshmana singh or archana gramin prishthbhumi ke the or us samay junior hyskool main padhate the
 On behalf of Umang, a second alternative report was also presented to the UNCRC in Geneva on the status of child rights in Uttarakhand
 is report main akhabaari madhyamon kaa hi prayog kiya gaya tha
 There was a lot of use of news, feature and comics related to children's problems
 nautial kehete hai, ''yuan kii kisi samiti main pehali baar aisi akhabaari report saunpi gai thi, jisaki kaaphi saraahna hui
 After this report, many positive policy changes were made by the Central and State Government
 isi maah skool ne aapadaa prabandhan tantra ko lekar report banaai, jisamen sabhi 13 jilon ke bal patrakaron ne shirkat kii
 The journalism of these children is important in the sense that it has drawn attention to many important questions, raised serious issues and prepared the ground for change
 apni ek comics main ek chote bachche ko maarthe pita kaa chitra banaakar is samooh ne bhartiya pariwaron main bacchon ke saath hone vaali hinsa kii ore dhyaan khinchaa
 These children can be the inspiration for mainstream journalists
 aadarneey bharat ke pradhan nyaayadhish, i hope that your citizen and judge will be disturbed by the incident of assault with journalists, lawyers and political activists in Patiala House Court
 hamaari adaalatein hawa main zahreele carbon kanon kii maatra ko bhaanp leti hai or sabhi sansthaaon ko khadkaa leti hai
 There is no reason not to rely on such sensitive courts that they will not be deterred once the air of democracy is bad
 balki aapaki sansthaaon ne rajanetaaon or academik logon se zyaada samay-samay par loktantr ke prati samaj ko vistaar diya he
 The judgments of the courts make the interpretation of democracy clear
 patiala house court main vakeelon ke samooh ne jo kiya wo adaalaton kii varshon kii arjeet uplabdhi par hamalaa he
 In a very challenging time, many judges wrote long-term decisions in favor of democracy, their legacy of understanding and courage has been attacked
 patiala house court jaisi ghatana se tay karnaa mushkil ho jayega ki jaj koun he
 Do lawyers have permission to form a group and become a judge and prove someone inside the court premises before the judge as a criminal or a terrorist? Do they have the right to kill people out of the premises of the honorable court? There should be no justice, it should be seen in spite of it
 agar court main reporter nahin jaaenge, log nahin jaaenge to insaaf hote hue koun dekhegaa
 Who will tell that justice has happened? somvaar ko patiala house court main jo hua he wo saamaanya nahin he
 Every school of advocacy is taught in the college that everyone has the right to be heard
 jab antkavaadi ko bhi vaqeel nahin miltaa to adaalatein vaqeel detii hai
 There are so many stages of law between the crime being committed and the accused being proved guilty
 har charan ke liye prakriya tay he
 Have not the lawyers attacked this argument of justice? In the past, many lawyers fought the case of terrorists and later on which parties they became prominent, they do not want to mention it in a negative tone but would like to say that those lawyers have made the definition of case justice of terrorists meaningful
 agar patiala house court main marpet karne vaale vakeelon ko ab bhi apni samaj par bharosa he to unhen baar council se guzarish kerani chahie ki ab se lau kalejon kii kitabon ke us chapter ko nahin padhaayaa jaae jisamen likhaa he ki hatyare se lekar aatankwaadi tak ko bhi vaqeel rakhane kaa adhikaar he
 They have the right to present their case
 patiala house court main hinsa karne vaale vakeelon kii sankhya ek do hoti to main yah patr nahin likhata lekin vahaan maujuud patrakaron ne bataaya ki badi sankhya main vaqeel hinsa par utaaru ho gaye the
 This should worry you too, but it must have happened
 baat sirf patiala court kii nahin he
 This type of incident has happened in small big courts of many states of the country
 main aapse guzarish karata hum ki is par ek vyavastha den
 Tell lawyers that it is not appropriate to do so
 kai zila adaalaton main maine dekha he ki vakeelon ke baithne kii uchit vyavastha nahin he
 Their working condition is very poor
 unke parivaar ke sadsy jab kaam karne kii jagah dekhte honge to unke aatm sammaan ko thes pahunchati hogi
 In some courts of Delhi, the situation has improved but in the district courts the condition is very bad
 unhen apni mez or kursi chen se baandh kar rakhni padati he
 i would love if your initiative improves this situation
 bharat sarkaar ko bhi iske liye pahal kerani chahie
 Sir, those lawyers also said that journalists are not needed
 ham jaananaa chaahate hai ki kya adaalatein bhi aisa sochati hai
 The insecurity of us journalists is like a lawyer sitting under a roof type with a typewriter
 lekin jab tak ham patrkaar hai or soochna dene kaa kaam kar rahe hai tab tak kya hamen surakshit rakhana loktantr kii sansthaaon kaa daayitv nahin he? ek daraa hua patrkaar loktantr main mara hua naagarik paidaa karata he
 Our information enables the citizen
 uskaa vishwaas badhata he
 If we are not able to do this work then only a crowd will be born in democracy
 patrakarita kaa kaam bheed paidaa karnaa nahin balki soochnaaon se las sakasham naagarik kaa nirmaan karnaa he
 The comments ham patrkaar maare gaye hai
 Have been killed on the war front
 police kii goliyon or netaaon ke gurgon se maare gaye hai
 i am not writing this letter because journalists have been killed in the Patiala court
 agar adaalat parisar main yah pravriti failati gai, vaqeel raajnneetik kaaryakarta kii tarah vyavhaar karenge to garib aadmi ko insaaf kaise milegaa
 Is it possible that a political party gets involved with a corporate and both of them together displace the poor and when the poor come to the court threshold for justice, the pro-poor poor of that party should be anti-development, anti-national He started beating after telling them
 tab kya hoga? desh kaa naagarik kitna asurakshit mahasoos karegaa
 The weak and the poor are not only persecuted by the corporate and political nexus, but the middle class also sometimes suffers
 aapkaa vakt keemati he
 Nevertheless, if you give an explanation as an answer to all these questions, then we will all be encouraged
 aap loktantr ke abhibhavak hai
 You are our ideal as a citizen
 mere likhane main jo chook hui ho use maaf kar dijiyegaa
 Sir, will the court be able to give credence or will it make any complete arrangement that violence should not happen in any court as a legitimate mob
 mujhe bharosa he ki nyaaypalika ke sheersh logon or vakaalat kii duniya main in sawaalon ko lekar bechaini hogi
 your, raveesh kumaar, a citizen and journalist mujhe ummid he ki patiala house court main patrakaron, vakeelon or raajnneetik kaaryakartaaon ke saath marpet kii ghatana se aapkaa naagarik or nyaayadhish man vyathit hua hoga
 Our courts detect the amount of poisonous carbon particles in the air and provoke all organizations
 waisi samvedansheel adaalaton par bharosa na karne kaa koi kaaran nahin banataa ki loktantr kii hawa karaab hote hi unhen fark nahin padegaa
 Rather, your institutions have extended the understanding of democracy from time to time more than politicians and academics
 adaalaton ke faisalon se loktantr kii vyakhya spasht hi hoti gai he
 What the group of lawyers did in the Patiala House Court is an attack on the years of achievement of the courts
 behad chunauteepurn samay main tamaam jajon ne loktantr ke haq main lambey-lambey faisale likhe, unki samaj or saahas kii viraasat par hamalaa hua he
 An incident like Patiala House Court will make it difficult to decide who the judge is
 kya vakeelon ko ijazat he ki ve samooh banaakar jaj ban jaaen or jaj se pehle adaalat parisar ke bheetar kisi ko apradhi yaa aatankwaadi sabit kar den? kya unhen adhikaar he ki mananeey adaalat ke parisar se logon ko maar maar kar baahar kar den? insaaf hona hi nahin chahie, hote hue bhi dikhnaa chahie
 If the reporter does not go to court, people will not go, then who will see justice being done
 koun batayega ki insaaf hua bhi he
 What happened in Patiala House Court on Monday is not normal
 vakaalat ke har skool college main yahi padhaayaa jaataa he ki sunwaayee kaa haq sabko he
 When the terrorists do not even get a lawyer, then the courts give a lawyer
 aparaadh kaa hona or aaropee kaa apradhi sabit hona iske bich kanoon kii kitni avasthaaen hai
 The process is fixed for each stage
 kya vakeelon ne insaaf ke is taqaaze par hamalaa nahin kiya he? ateet main kai vakeelon ne aatankwaadiyon kaa cese ladaa or baad main ve kin-kin dalon main pratishthit hue iskaa zikr nakaaratmak lahaze main nahin karnaa chahta balki kahana chaahunga ki un vakeelon ne aatankwaadiyon kaa cese ladke insaaf kii paribhaasha ko sarthak kiya he
 If the lawyers who beat up the Patiala House Court still have faith in their understanding, they should request the Bar Council not to read the chapter of the Law Colleges books from now onwards, from the killer to the terrorist
 It is right to have a lawyer
 apana paksh rakhane kaa haq he
 i would not have written this letter if the number of lawyers committing violence in Patiala House Court would have been one to two, but the journalists present there said that a large number of lawyers had turned to violence
 isse aapako bhi chintaa honi chahie balki hui bhi hogi
 It is not just about the Patiala court
 desh ke kai rajyon kii choti badi adaalaton main is tarah kii ghatana ho chuki he
 i request you to make an arrangement on this
 vakeelon se kahen ki aisa karnaa uchit nahin he
 In many district courts, i have seen that there is no proper seating arrangement for lawyers
 unke kaam karne kii sthiti bahut kharaab he
 When their family members see the place of work, then their self-respect will be hurt
 dilli kii kuch adaalaton main to sthiti behatar hui he par zila adaalaton main haalat bahut kharaab he
 They have to tie their table and chair to the chain
 agar aapaki pahal se is sthiti main kuch sudhaar ho jaae to mujhe acha lagegaa
 The Government of India should also take initiative for this
 sar, un vakeelon kaa yah bhi kahana tha ki patrakaron kii zarurat nahin he
 We want to know if the courts also think so
 ham patrakaron kii asuraksha bhi khuli chat ke neeche tiperiter lekar baithe vaqeel kii tarah hi he
 But as long as we are journalists and doing information work, is it not the responsibility of the institutions of democracy to keep us safe? a scared journalist produces a dead citizen in a democracy
 hamaari soochnaaon se naagarik sakasham hota he
 His faith increases
 ham agar ye kaam nahin kar paaenge to loktantr main sirf bheed hi paidaa hoti rahegi
 The job of journalism is not to create crowds but to create a competent citizen equipped with information
 tippaniyan We journalists have been killed
 yuddh ke morche par maare gaye hai
 Police bullets and leaders have been killed by operatives
 main yah patr isaliye nahin likh rahaa ki patiala court main patrakaron kaa maaraa gaya he
 If this trend continued to spread in the court premises, the lawyers would behave like political activists, then how would the poor man get justice
 kya aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki kisi corporate ke saath raajnneetik dal kaa yaarana ho jaae or donon milakar garibon ko visthapit kar den or jab ye garib insaaf ke liye adaalat kii dahleez par aaen to us dal ke samarthak vaqeel garibon ko vikaas virdohi, raashtra virdohi bataakar maarane lage
 What will happen then How insecure the citizen of the country will feel
 kamazor or garib hi corporate or raajnneetik nexs se sataae nahin jate hai balki madhyam varg bhi kabhi kabhi chapet main aa jaataa he
 Your time is valuable
 phir bhi aap in sab sawaalon ke jawaab ke taur par vyakhya den to ham sab kaa hausala badhegaa
 You are the guardian of democracy
 ek naagarik ke taur par aap hi hamaare adarsh hai
 i will forgive any errors in my writing
 sar, kya adaalat yah bharosa de paaegi yaa koi mukammal vyavastha karegi ki kisi bhi adaalat main vaqeel bheed banakar hinsa na karen
 i trust that there will be uneasiness about these questions in the judiciary's top people and the world of advocacy
 aapkaa, ravish Kumar, ek naagarik or patrkaar What the group of lawyers did in the Patiala House Court is an attack on the years of achievement of the courts

 sar, kya adaalat yah bharosa de paaegi yaa koi mukammal vyavastha karegi ki kisi bhi adaalat main vaqeel bheed banakar hinsa na karen
 i trust that there will be uneasiness about these questions in the judiciary's top people and the world of advocacy
 aapkaa, ravish Kumar, ek naagarik or patrkaar Sir, those lawyers also said that journalists are not needed
 ham jaananaa chaahate hai ki kya adaalatein bhi aisa sochati hai
 The insecurity of us journalists is like a lawyer sitting under a roof type with a typewriter
 lekin jab tak ham patrkaar hai or soochna dene kaa kaam kar rahe hai tab tak kya hamen surakshit rakhana loktantr kii sansthaaon kaa daayitv nahin he? ek daraa hua patrkaar loktantr main mara hua naagarik paidaa karata he
 Our information enables the citizen
 uskaa vishwaas badhata he
 If we are not able to do this work then only a crowd will be born in democracy
 patrakarita kaa kaam bheed paidaa karnaa nahin balki soochnaaon se las sakasham naagarik kaa nirmaan karnaa he
 The comments ham patrkaar maare gaye hai

 kisi tarah filmon main entry hone ke baad kangana ko shooting ke pehle hi din daant padi thi
 Kangana recalled the early days of Bollywood while campaigning on a radio station
 unhone kaha ki, 'tseol main 'gangster' kii shooting kaa pehla din romaanchak tha
 It was a strange day
 anuraag ek bada shot le rahe the or mujhe ek jagah se chalane ke liye kah rahe the

 i had to listen a lot

 australia ke diggaj tej gendbazglen maikgraka maananaa he ki australia ek baar phir aagaamee ashes siries main 5-0 se jeet darj kar england kaa supada saaf karegaa
 The former Australian player said, 'I am curious about the Ashes
 maine pehle 5-0 se jeet kaa anumaan lagaaya tha lekin ab mujhe lagata he ki yah antar 10-0 kaa hoga kyonki australia ne pichhali siries ko 5-0 se khatm kiya tha
 mcgrath, who arrived here for a brand, said the Australian team is playing very well while being out of the knock out round of the World Cup has reduced England's confidence
 main har match main australia kii jeet ke saath acha cricket chahta hum
 mcgrath, who is set to play a commentator in the Ashes to be held in july-august this year, feels that England will play better in their country
 maikgra ne is dauraan australia ke tej gendbaaj mishael johnson ke netritv vaali tej gendbaaji kii jamkar tarif kii
 He said that Australia have good bowlers like Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood and all are capable of bowling very well
 yah maikgra hi hai jinhone team india ke khilaaf bhi apni team ke 4-0 se siries jeetne kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi
 But that series Australia could barely win 2–0
 inputah bhashaa On one hand, while Rahul Gandhi is speaking out against corruption and corrupt people, on the other hand, BJP is also making claims to keep tainted people away from the party, but the difference between the statement and the doing of these parties is clear in the distribution of tickets
 Is visible association for democratic riforms kii ore se jari aankadon se pataa chalata he ki in donon badi partiyon ne hi badi sankhya main un netaaon ko tikat die hai jinke khilaaf gambhir aparaadhik maamle chal rahe hai
 Of the 62 candidates declared by the BJP for the Lok Sabha elections, 23 have criminal cases against them and 14 are facing serious criminal cases
 isi tarah congress ke 126 ummidavaaron main 33 ke khilaaf aapraadhik or 10 ke khilaaf gambhir aparaadhik maamle saamne aae
 That means 30 percent of such people have got tickets against whom some criminal case is going on
 in aakandon ne kai anya partiyon ke netaaon ko desh kii do badi partiyon par hamalaa bolne bolne kaa puraa mauka de diya he
 JDU leader Sharad Yadav says that we will take up this issue when the time comes
 pichhali baar bhi janata ne daagdar netaaon ko haraaya tha or is baar bhi vahi sabak sikhayegi
 After the Supreme Court's decision on the cases going against all mps and mlas in a year, it is certain that even if these tainted candidates win, they will not be able to last long in Parliament
 aise main sawaal yahi he ki ye jaanate hue bhi partiyaan daagi netaaon ko tikat kyon de rahi hai? vaise bhi abhi bahut se ummidavaaron ke naam kaa elaan hona baaki he
 It will be known soon how the image of those candidates will be
 lekin ek kadava sach yah he ki yadi daagi netaa jeet kar sansad pahunch bhi jate hai or baad main un par aparaadh sabit ho jaataa he to may 2015 tak ve bhi lalu yadav kii taraf sansad se baahar ho jaaenge
 The batsmen dominated the tournament throughout the ICC World Cup 2015, but two bowlers emerged as heroes in Australia's title win
 ravivaar ko melbern cricket maidan (emsiji) par hue final mukaable main australia ne newjiland ko saat wicket se haraakar paanchavin baar world cap khitaab par kabja jamaaya
 The Australian victory was pacer James Faulkner
 foconor ko unke umdaa pradarshan ke liye player of da match chunaa gaya
 At the same time, Australian fast bowler Mitchell Starc, who took 22 wickets after playing eight matches in the tournament, was awarded the Player of the Tournament Award
 final mukaable main main of da match rahe folownar ne newjiland ke teen ahm ballebaajon ross tailor, kore anderson or grant iliyat ke wicket chatka match kaa pasa palat diya or newjiland team 45 overon main 183 ranon par simat gai
 Stark, who was Player of the Tournament, played a key role in Australia's win and 10 in the entire tournament on the other hand
 2 ke ausat se or 3
 Bowled extremely economically at an economy rate of 5
 vastav main gendbaajon ko mili pramukh aword se is world cap ke bare main sahi se nahin janaa ja saktaa, jisamen pehali baar vah bhi do-do ballebaajon ne doharaa shatak lagane kaa karnama kiya
 The entire World Cup took two double centuries, six more than 150, and a total of 35 centuries
 gendbaajon kii is world cap main jamkar dhunaai hui, ise isi baat se samajha ja saktaa he ki prati match lagbhag 10 chakke lage
 Despite the excellent bowling by Stark and Faulkner, cricket analysts are calling for a change in the rules to curb batting and there is a demand to reduce the width of the bat as well
 bhartiya cricket team ke captain mahendra singh dhoni ne bhi pichley saptaah semifinal se harkar baahar hone ke baad kaha tha ki atyadhik chaukon-chhakkon se vanade cricket ubaau hota ja rahaa he
 - Input IANS karnataka vidhansabha chunaavon se saaf he ki rajya main kisi ek raajnneetik dal ko spasht bahumat nahin mil rahaa
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has emerged as the largest party in the state but it needs the support of some more mlas to form the government
 vahiin congress ke paas duusare number par sabase zyada vidhayak hai or tisare number par khadi jedies ke paas maujuud aankadon se donon milakar sarkaar banane kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, the eyes of the nation are now focused on the Raj Bhavan as the SR Bommai case of the Supreme Court becomes very important to form the government in this case
 es aar bommai cese ke mutabik kisi bhi party ko purna bahumat nahin milane kii sthiti main rajya kaa governor us dal ke netaa ko aamantran detaa he jiske paas zyada sankhya he
 However, there are two ways to view numbers
 pehla, kyasarkaar bananeka daawa karne vaala dal sabase badi party ke taur par chun kar aayaa he
 Secondly, if two or more parties present their support to the governor by forming a coalition to form a majority figure after the results, then even in such a situation, the governor invites such coalition to form the government, seeing enough figures to form the government
 Can do
 haalanki, aise gathbandhan main governor ko vivekadhikaar he ki vah kisi tarah kii horsetrading kii sambhaavna ko paidaa na hone de or upyukt daavedaar ko hisarkaar banane keliye aamantrit kare
 Therefore, amidst the possibility of horseracing, the governor may also decide to give the largest party in the election results a chance to form a government and give him time to prove his majority in the assembly, giving him at least 10 to 15 days

 You know Indian porn star Sunny Leone
 lekin in dinon jo porn star charchaa main he vah aadhi canadai or aadhi punjabi he
 In the world of porn, people know this American girl by the name of Belle Knox, while her real name is Lauren
 khayr, khaas baat yah he ki lauren jis vajah se porn star bani vah bahut nai to nahin he, lekin zyada prachlit bhi nahin he
 Actually, she became a porn star to study at Duke University
 khabaron ke mutabik grameuation kar rahi lauren ke paas tab koi chaara nahin bachaa jab afghanistan main tainaat uske america doctor pita or bhartiya maa ne uski padhai ke paison main katautee kar di
 In such a situation, he thought of only one way to raise money for expensive studies
 lekin kadava sach yah he ki jab uske dharmik catholic pita ghar waapas laute to unhen pataa chalaa ki unki beti ab bahut mashhoor ho gai he, lekin us vajah se nahin jaise ki ek pita kii ummid hoti he
 The media and the whole world did not spare the girl at all
 media main ladki kii har choti si choti detail share karne kii hode si machi hui he
 Even his identity, names of his friends and family members have been made public
 aise main ab lauren ke bhai-bahan or maa-baap bahut zyada pareshaan or naakhush hai
 Most media houses have begun investigating the reason for Lauren becoming a porn star
 kisi ne kaha ki vah sex kii dabi ichchhaaon ko puraa karne ke liye porn star bani he or uski najaron main yah sexual aazaadee he
 At the same time, Lauren says that she adopted this path to complete studies
 yahi nahin usne daawa kiya ki ucch madhyamvargeey or kam aay vaale parivaar karj ke boj se lard rahe he
 While other children found jobs to earn money for their studies, Lauren found a way to become a porn star
 kyon? kyonki vah sirf do ghante main 1,000 america dollar yani ki lagbhag 61,000 rupee kama leti he
 Lauren claims that the rest of the children are unable to do so
 deshbhar ke kai rajyon main ruke hue projectus ke liye centre kii pichhali UPA sarkaar kabhumi adhigrahan bilajimmedaar nahin he
 According to the news published in an English newspaper, this has been revealed through RTI
 jabaki endie kii sarkaar ne ruke hue projectus ke liye UPA sarkaar ke bhoomi adhigrahan bill ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha
 In fact, the Central Kimodi government had blamed the previous government's land acquisition bill for stalled projects in many states across the country
 sarkaar kii daleel di thi ki aise maamalon se nipatane ke liye bhoomi adhigrahan bill main sudhaar kii jarurat he
 But when activist Venkatesh Nayak tried to know this through RTI, the truth was different
 RTI main is baat kaa khulaasa hua he ki deshbhar main sirf 8 fisadi projects hi aise hai jo pichhali sarkaar ke bhoomi adhigrahan bill kii vajah se rukii hui he
 In most cases, lack of clearance from the environment department, lack of money with the builder or the market itself has been held responsible
 vitt mantralay dwaara bheje gaye is RTI report ke mutabik ruke hue kul 804 projectus main 145 lagjri projectus hai jinamein hotel, restraan, shopping mal, multiplex, golf course or racing trek banane hai
 Also, there are only 11 such projects in which 5 slum dwellers are proposed, 2 for budget homes, one for old age homes
 is report main ye bhi khulaasa hua he ki ruke hue zyaadaatar projects main se 78 fisadi privet companiyon yaa logon ke hai or sirf 22 fisadi project sarkari hai
 If there is anything that is most disturbed in today's runaway life, it is food
 is maamle main galat aadaton kii vajah se kai aisi bimaariyaan ghar kar leti hai jinka hamen turant pataa bhi nahin chal paata he
 There are many important things in Ayurveda in relation to food, by knowing about which we can avoid many diseases
 kuch chizon ko ek saath khaanaa sharir ke liye jehar sabit ho saktaa he
 Here we are telling you about nine such mismatched foods that eating together at one time can prove to be dangerous for you
 1
 Consuming fruits before and immediately after eating can be dangerous, fruits are highly digestible
 lekin jab yahi fal anaaj ke saath milakar pachan tantra main pahunchate hai to unhen pachne main samay lagata he
 Their kindness starts in the digestive system itself
 isse aanton kii deevaaron ko nuksaan pahunchataa haior saath acidity kii samasya ho jaati he
 2
 maance or starch kaa seven karnaa he khataranakmance main bharpoor protein hota he
 In such a situation, if the intake of protein and carbohydrate is taken together, both the nutrients can do harm instead of benefiting
 donon ke pachne main alag-alag pachak anzime kaam karte hai or jab donon hi chijen ekasaath khai gai hon to anzimes ke bich riection ho saktaa he
 This can cause gas and stomach cramps
 3
 Taking syrup with lemon may cause discomfort due to lemon, which do not secrete enzymes that work to break down cholesterol
 aise main kaph syrup main paae jane vaale mukhya tatv tut nahin pateor unka puraa phayda nahin mil paata he
 At the same time, the possibility of getting a throat block also increases
 4
 Tomatoes and carbohydrates are a combination
 Khatarnakamatar has acidic properties and can prove to be dangerous if you eat anything containing heavy starch or carbohydrates
 isse pachan kriya par asar padataa he or pet dard kii shikaayat ho sakati he
 5
 ekasaath kabhi mat khaaen fal or dahiflon or kisi bhi deyari utpaada ko ek saath istemaal karnaa khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 This can cause sinus and other respiratory problems
 khaastaur par falon ke saath dahi kaa seven karnaa nuksaandeh ho saktaa he
 The word family is not right in politics, but it is also associated with those who oppose the family's otherism
 congress ke parivaarwaad kii raajnneeti ke virodh main do parivaar khadey hue the
 Janata Parivar and Sangh Parivar
 lekin sansad or vidhansabhaon main maujuud pratinidhiyon kii prishthbhumi kaa adhyayan kijiye to pataa chalegaa ki puri bhartiya raajnneeti hi pariwaron ke kabze main hai
 For the name, the post of president is free from the family and then the post of prime minister kahin parivaarwaad kaa virodh he to kahin saamne vaale kaa virodh karte hue bagal vaale parivaarwaad se samjhauta bhi
 Today a family is formed in Delhi
 janata parivaar
 i remember there were elections for the presidency
 sipiem netaa harkishan singh surajeet ke ghar par baithak chal rahi thi
 Mulayam was adamant on his candidate
 media ke sainkadon camere surajeet ke ghar ke baahar intazaar kar rahe the
 Mulayam came out and removed the mike and said that there is no front
 aaj unheen mulaayam singh yadav ko sharad yadav or devegoda ke bich dabe hue sakuchaaye hue baithe dekha to laga ki vakt or umr kitna saadh detaa he
 The Netaji whom no one considered a leader for the post of Prime Minister
 sonia gandhi ne samarthan dene se manaa kar diya, us netaa ko aaj paanch anya dalon ke netaaon ne apana netaa maan liya
 There have been such meetings in politics
 ek se ek dhur virdohi gale milte rahe hai
 Ram Vilas Paswan kept doing politics by saying that he alone had the courage to resign from the cabinet after the Gujarat riots
 vahi ramvilas paswan narendra modi sarkaar main mantri hai
 Mulayam Singh Yadav, who was rebelling against Sonia Gandhi, kept saving his party's government for ten years
 isliye aise maukon par adarsh yaa puraane vaakyon bayanon kaa koi matlab nahin rah jaataa
 These families arose in the name of anti-congress
 bijepi ko bhi congress virodh kaa laabh mila lekin sangh ke kaaran bijepi ek sangathit party ke rup main ubhartee chali gai
 At the same time, the Janata family got shattered
 lekin dhyaan se dekhenge ki yah parivaar mitaa nahin
 There is an example of complete disappearance in Gujarat itself
 ab kisi ko pataa nahin ki vahaan chiman bhai patel kii sarkaar dene vaala dal kahaan gaya
 But it has survived in some form or the other in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka, Odisha and Jammu and Kashmir
 kai rajyon main samaajwaadiyon ne do-do baar sarkarein banaain hai
 In Odisha, till date the BJP has not figured out any formula to deal with the Biju Janata Dal
 upi main 2007 main mayawati ne mulaayam singh yadav ke gundaraj ko mudda banaakar purna bahumat se sarkaar banaai thi
 Even after this, Akhilesh Yadav's cycle overtook everyone in 2012
 nitish kumaar kii do-do baar sarkaar bani
 Even after the BJP split, they managed to save their government
 jab laga ki narendra modi or bijepi ne jithan ram maanjhi ko apane prabhaav main le liya he or janata dal united ko tod dena aasaan he, uske baad bhi janata parivaar apana vajood bachaane main safal rahaa or nitish phir se mukhyamantri ban gaye
 Overall, there is experience of shattering and breaking up in this part of politics, and there is also experience of losing power
 in varshon main inhen raaj karnaa aa gaya he
 Now he is no longer an opposition camp opposing Congress
 bhartiya raajnneeti kaa yah bhi ek ruling class he
 Had their existence been so weak, the PDP, which was part of the Janata Parivar in Jammu and Kashmir, would not have been forced to join hands with the BJP
 isliye janata parivaar ko itihaas ke aadhaar par hi khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Between 1977 and 1990, the Janata Parivar continued to connect in one way or the other and had the opportunity to become the Prime Minister several times, but his biggest achievement was that he linked the alliance to instability
 janata ise hakeekat maanate hue sthirataa dene vaale dal ke aadhaar par hi gathbandhan ko chunati rahi
 But the only success of their governments would not have been instability
 1990 ke saal se janata parivaar ne bikharana shuru kiya
 Everyone has their own party and everyone is the leader of their own party
 kisi ko andaaza nahin tha ki narendra modi naam kaa koi shaks unke garh main ghus aayega
 This socialist faction of politics has a historical tendency
 ye hameshaa apane majboot virdohi yaa dushman ke saamne ekajute hue hai
 They came from anywhere, met anyone under the leadership of Jai Prakash Narayan
 lekin baad main inkaa astitv congress yaa bijepi ke hone yaa na hone par nirbhar nahin rahaa
 This is the first time after Indira Gandhi that the old brothers of Janata Parivar are missing the village
 jahaan ve jaakar phir se sanyukt parivaar kaa mukhiya dhund laae hai
 So that this time a new adversary is fought
 bhaajapa virodh ke naam par ekajute hua jaae
 Who knows what will happen, what is happening can be seen
 mangalvaar ko purv rajyapal or uttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri endi tiwari ke bete 40 saal ke rohit shekhar tiwari kii rahasyamay halaat main maut ho gayi thi
 It was initially thought that he died of a heart attack or brain hemorrhage, but on Thursday, the police were shocked when the Delhi Police received a post-mortem report of Rohit Shekhar from AIIMS Hospital
 pataa chalaa ki rohit kii hatya hui he, kisi ne takie yaa duusari cheez se uskaa munh dabaakar use maut ke ghat utaar diya
 According to Rohit Shekhar's postmortem report, he died due to throat blockage or throat choke
 report ke hisaab se munh kisi cheez se dabaaya gaya jisase ve saans nahin le paae or galaa bhi ghonta gaya
 This led to his death
 maut kaa samay 15 -16 april kii darmiyaani raat main 1:30 baje kaa he

 congress ke chaukeedaar chor he ke naare ke jawaab main bijepi ne main bhi chaukeedaar naare kii dhar tej kar di
 Today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's team is going to do a mega show to spread this slogan across the country
 rafel par congress ke chaukeedaar chor he campan par palitha lagane ke liye bijepi ne chaukeedaar ko hi bada hathiyaar bana liya
 The BJP has launched a campaign to spread the watchman across the country in his new slogan
 team modi ne kuch din pehle hi main bhi hum chaukeedaar abhiyaan shuru kiya
 The Prime Minister himself started this campaign by adding a watchman in front of the name on his Twitter handle and then the process started
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah, tamaam kendriya mantri, tamaam bade netaa chaukeedaar tag ko apana liya
 Now the BJP is busy in spreading the slogan with the watchman
 aaj dilli ke talkatoraa stadium main ek mega program hoga, jisamen pradhanmantri narendra modi khud desh ke 500 se zyada ilaakon se judenge
 From the video conference, Prime Minister Main Hoon Chowkidar will carry forward the campaign and BJP ministers, mps, mlas and leaders will be present across the country to listen to the Prime Minister

 upi ke mukhyamantri agra main pradhanmantri ko sunenge to sultanpur main menka gandhi or pilibhit main varun gandhi honge, jabaki bhopal main kendriya mantri narendra singh tomars or rampur main jaya pradaa hongi
 The Congress gave the slogan of Chowkidar Chor Hai to surround the Modi government on Rafale
 rahul gandhi har sabha main isi naare se bijepi ko gherte rahe
 Now BJP cut this slogan with the watchman's slogan
 khud ke liye chaukeedaar shabd kaa prayog piem modi ne 2014 main bhi kiya tha
 Prime Minister Modi, then, described himself as a janitor and surrounded the Congress on corruption
 2014 main narendra modi ne kaha tha ki aap mujhe pradhanmantri mat banaaie aap mujhe chaukeedaar mat banaaie
 i will sit like a watchman in Delhi and assure you
 aap aisa chaukeedaar bithaaoge ki hindustan kii tijori par koi panja nahin padane duungaa
 After 5 years, that slogan surfaced again

 But he did not say why elections were not held in the name of swearing in this one year

 The Prime Minister has said that where the slum houses, but i say that a clean slum, clean house

 The BJP knows where the social base of the Aam Aadmi Party is, so with the help of building and cleaning houses in the slums, it will challenge the AAP there

 In the poster outside the office, Satish Upadhyay is ahead and Kiran Bedi is behind
 lekin aaj ke bhaashan se saaf ho gaya ki koun peeche he
 It is good that Kiran Bedi laid out a blueprint for her thinking
 ho saktaa he aane vaale dinon main or bhi baaten vah kahen, lekin aaj jo bhi kaha usase yahi laga ki vah apni taraf se hi elaan kar rahi hai ki bijepi kii mukhyamantri kii ummidavaar vahiin hai

 In his Independence Day speech on 15 August, what Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced to increase the minimum wage of skilled and non-skilled laborers in Delhi to Rs 14 to 17 thousand, came down on his own opposition in the party
 aam aadmi party kii treders wing ne mukhyamantri ke is faisle par kadaa aitraaj jataayaa he or ye bhi dhamkee di he ki agar mantrimandal kii baithak main faisle par punarvichaar kar ise badla nahin gaya to dilli band kar virodh pradarshan kiya jayega
 The government did not discuss any discussion with the traders wing of its own party! Different traders' associations have started creating an atmosphere of protest, calling this decision of Kejriwal government a part of the government's anti-trader policy
 AAP kii treders wing ke sanyojak brajesh goyal ne kaha kimukhyamantri arvind kejarivalke is achaanak liye faisle par 100 se zyada vyapaaree samoohon ke phone unke paas aae hai or tamaam vyapaaree sanghathan hairaan hai
 Delhi already has a minimum wage of up to 30% more than the rest of the states
 aise main 50 fisadi or ijapha karne kaa koi tuk nahin banataa he
 Goyal said that this issue will be raised in a democratic way in the party
 vyapaaree chaahate hai ki mantrimandal kii baithak main isfaislaper punarvichaar ho or faisla waapas liya jaae
 Going further, Goyal also says that the interests of traders are paramount for the party's traders wing and if the government upholds the decision, then Delhi will be closed and the traders wing will protest against their own government
 agar ye faisla amal main aayaa to tamaam udyog dhandhe dilli se palaayan karnaa shuru kar denge kyonki dilli main vyavsaay karnaa ghate kaa sauda ho jayega
 Does Kejriwal want us to stop business? Vinay Bahl, General Secretary of NDTA i
e
 New Delhi Traders Association, says that while seeking votes, Kejriwal had said that the government will take every section along but now the traders have been completely forgotten
 is
 jis tarah anti tryder faisle liye ja rahe hai use dekhte hue lagata he ki kaam-dhandha band hi karnaa padegaa
 a fifty percent increase in the minimum wage simply means that this will increase corruption because businessmen will have to pay employees blacks
 compliance kii dikkat badhegi
 This decision of the government is suicidal
 up mukhyamantri milenge treders associationon sedilli ke upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya buudhvaar ko AAP kii treders wing ke saath-saath dilli ke alag-alag treders associationon se milenge
 Sources are telling that Kejriwal government will reconsider this decision taken on the advice of the government's Labor Minister Gopal Rai as the decision is far from the ground reality
 philhal nunatam vetan main pachaas fisadi kaa ijapha kisi nazariye se taarkik kadam nahin he kyonki dilli main vyapaariyon kii haalat pehle hi kharaab he

 The rain disrupted the first semi-final of the World Cup 2019 being played between Team India and New Zealand in Manchester
 barish ne match main aise samay dastak di jab team india mukaable main apni pakad majboot bana chuki thi
 Team India fast bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar was going to bowl the second ball of the 47th over when the rain came as a hindrance

 It was 211 at the loss of 5 wickets in 1 over

 In such a situation, the question now arises as to which team benefited from the rain
 kya newjiland ko barish se madad mili yaa ye team india ke liye villen sabit hogi

 co / xim0zbscug— Cricket World Cup (@cricketworldcup)july 9, 2019match rukne tak to do sthiti ban rahi thi
 The first is to use the DLS method in the match or to start the match again on the day of Reserve Day from where it ended
 isisi kii koshish thi ki is match ko aaj hi khatm kiya jaae
 This could only be done using the DLS method
 yani ki isamen over kam kiye jate or bharat ko ek nirdhaarit lakshya miltaa
 If the DLS method were implemented, what would be the target for Team India? 237 runs to be scored in 46 overs, 223 runs to be scored in 35 overs, 209 runs to be scored in 30 overs, 192 runs to be scored in 25 overs, 172 runs to be scored in 20 overs
 This situation is not beneficial for India
 pehle jahaan agar barish match main khalal nahin daalati, to newjiland par team india jis tarah se pakad banaai hui thi usase usko 240 yaa 250 tak kaa lakshya miltaa
 In such a situation, Team India captain Virat Kohli would have been satisfied with this score
 team india ke liye phydemand rigerv dedusri sthiti main match ko rigerv de par shuru kiya janaa he
 That is, New Zealand's innings will start from the second ball of the 47th over and will have to face 23 balls
 rigerv de ke din zyaadaatar ballebaaji bhartiya team ko kerani hogi
 He will get the full 50 overs
 aise main bhartiya ballebaaj puri tarah se tarotaaja hokar ballebaaji karne utrenge
 After bowling 47 overs, players will get a lot of rest
 team india ke olerounder hardik pandya daaen pair ke upree hisse main dard hone ke baad kuch der ke liye aaj maidan se baahar chale gaye the, unhen bhi aaraam kaa puraa mauka milegaa
 At the same time, if it rains even on Reserve Day and the match does not start then the result of the match will be extracted on the basis of points and the team with more points will get the ticket for the final
 point teble main bharat top par he, jabaki newjiland chauthe sthaan par he
 In such a situation, India will get the final ticket
 to kul milakar bhartiya khemaa manaa rahaa hoga ki aaj kisi bhi haal main match na ho or buudhvaar ko hi match shuru ho

 But is it really true? Firstly, it is very important to know that changing life means negative, it is not necessary
 ye badlaav sakaaratmak bhi ho saktaa he
 With marriage, two people, two families become one
 ho saktaa he aapke or aapke partner ke bich talmail itnaa acha ho kii jindagi kii har mushkil choti najar aane lage par aisa hi ho ye jaruri nahin
 In many cases, there is no coordination between two people and life starts becoming a burden
 par koi bhi sthiti ek din main paidaa nahin hoti
 Everything between you two is not right, so its symptoms will start appearing in the beginning
 agar aapke saath bhi kuch aisa hi ho rahaa he to ye aapke liye sanbhalane kaa vakt he
 It will be better to handle the situation before it ruins everything
 1
 Fighting over money: Do you have a debate on saving and spending money everyday? Is there a lack of coordination between the two of you and due to this, the budget of the house is deteriorating? If yes, then it is time for you to recover
 2
 Does your partner pay more attention to others? Is there a vacuum between the two of you? Does it happen to you that you are sitting with your partner and he is busy talking to others on mobile? He does not mind that you are sitting with him and both of you can have a good time? If this happens in your house too, it is a daily thing, then it will be better, be careful
 3
 Do you both think differently? You like to hang out and you plan to hang out someday but your partner refuses to leave
 agar aapke saath bhi aisa hota he ki aap or aapke partner ke bich kisi bhi plan ko lekar ek soch nahin ban paati he to apane rishte ko lekar phikrmand ho jaaie
 4
 kya aapkaa partner raat kaa vakt doston ke saath bitaana pasand karata he?kya aapkaa partner raat main apane doston ke saath rahanaa pasand karata he? kya ye uski aadat ban chuki he? agar haa, to samaj lijie kii aap donon ke bich sabakuch thik nahin he auravo aapako nazarandaaj kar rahaa he
 5
 aapke bich ab wo baat nahin?agar aap donon ke bich ab wo pehle vaala pyaar nahin rah gaya he or aapke partner ko aapmen koi ruchi nahin rah gai he to ye vakt sochane kaa he

 Every girl wishes that her married life is always happy
 iske liye har ladki koshish bhi karti he lekin kai baar ham anjaane main aisi choti-choti galtiyaan kar baithte hai jo hamaare rishte ko barbaad kar detii he
 These habits gradually eclipse your happy married life and we do not even know
 ham aapako bataane ja rahe hai ki kin choti-choti galatiyon kii vajah se aap apane pati or shaadi donon ko barbaad kar rahi hai
 1- Nadani in the matter of spending money - there is a saying that the more the sheet is spread, the more legs should be spread
 har patni ko chahie ki apane ghar kii kamai ko dhyaan main rakhkar kharch kare or bajet banaae
 If you are not sensible in terms of money, then it may cost you later
 lagaataar lagzerius chizon kii kami kii shikaayat karte rahanaa acchhee baat nahin he
 If your husband is drowning in debt, then this will increase the stress on him and in such a situation you may also have a bad mood
 ho saktaa he ki aap maheenon se jis bag ko khareednaa chaah rahi hon, wo naa kharid paaen lekin aapke pati is baat kii man hi man tarif jarur karenge ki aap unka sammaan karti hai or vah jo kuch aapako uplabdh karaate hai, usee main aap khush hai
 This increases both love and respect for each other
 ye 7 aadaten hai to aap sabit honge bure pati2-lagaataar negative baaten-aapako apane baalo se nafrat he, ghar ke aas-paas hone vaala shor, padosiyon kaa bartaav, aapkaa offis kaa damb sahyogi, naukaraani kaa kharaab kaam
 If you keep complaining to everyone all the time, then it has a bad effect on your relationship
 ho saktaa he kai baar aapaki aalochana sahi hi ho, phir bhi aapako apane pati ke saamne har kisi kii buraai nahin kerani chahie
 This will create a negative image in your mind
 aapke pati jaise hi ghar main pravesh karte hai, aapako apane dimag se sari negative baton ko hataa dena chahie
 Boys like to sort things out and if you surround them with a heap of complaints, then they might go away from you
 har aadmi chahta he ki vah apni patni ko khush rakhen lekin agar usko yah mahasoos hota he ki vah aisa nahin kar paa rahaa he to vah niraash ho jaataa he
 Sometimes it is okay to fight them but do not include it in your routine
 3- hameshaa duusari chizon ko apni praathamikta main rakhana-jab aapke saamne aapke bachche, maa, dost yaa kariyar aata he to aap apane pati ko darkinar kar detii hai or unhen yah ehsaas karaati hai ki unki koi khaas ahmiyat aapaki life main nahin he
 Think how you would feel if you kept on saying this every day for many years? Surely your feelings and your confidence will be hurt
 aajkal kai couples ke talaak kii ek vajah yah bhi hoti he ki ve ek-duusare kii dekhbhaal nahin karte hai or ek-duusare ko bilkul ahmiyat nahin dete hai
 Do not make such mistake inadvertently
 4-pyaar jataane se dur bhaagna-har pati apni patni se physical afections bhi chahta he
 If you are constantly running away from them, they may find it bad
 apane pati ko control karne ke liye kabhi bhi intimesi ko hathiyaar naa banaaen
 Love and romance in your relationship is necessary to strengthen your relationship
 5- har baat ishaare main naa karen-koi bhi jaruri baat agar aap apane pati se kahana chaahati he to use aasaan or saaf bhashaa main kah den
 Do not talk to him in signs that your husband cannot understand
 apni bhaawanaaon ko eemaandaaree se bayaan karen
 If he asks you what has happened, do not expect him to understand everything by saying 'nothing'
 agar aap har baat gol-gol ghumaakar kahengi to ye aap donon ke rishte ko or jatil hi banayega

 ) The political riots of Uttar Pradesh are to begin in western UP
 ye wo ilaaka he jo dango ke saae main chunaav main jaayegaa
 Here BJP, sp-congress alliance, BSP as well as Chaudhary Ajit Singh are also in the political arena
 sabhi kii apni-apni ranneeti he, lekin gathbandhan or basapa kii ranneeti sabase dilachasp he
 As per Akhilesh and Rahul's strategy, western UP is considered a weak link between Congress and SP
 sapa pehle se is jatland main kamjor rahi he, kyonki yahaan yadav matadaata kaaphi kam hai
 In such a situation, with the help of Congress, SP is trying to bring Muslim vote bank in its court
 lekin usko dar he ki, bijepi virodh ke naam par muslim vot basapa ke paale main naa jaaen kyonki basapa ke paas daliton kaa base vot bhi he
 That is why SP and Congress are eyeing Jat leader Ajit Singh on one side
 unako lagata he ki, choudhary bijepi ko hi voton kaa nuksaan pahuchaayenge
 On the other hand, they will loudly tell the whole of western UP that, in UP, Mayawati has formed alliances after the election 3 times, will do it even further
 saath hi koshish yahi he ki, pashchimi upi kii ladaai ko bijepi banaam gathbandhan banaaya jaye, jisase muslim matadaata gathbandhan ke paale main rahen or aar-paar kii ladaai main bijepi virodh kaa vot or muslim vot milakar gathjod kii naiyya paar laga denge
 That is why Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is keeping BJP on target in his meetings
 ranneeti ke tahat hi rahul gandhi kehete hai ki, basapa kii baat karnaa main jaruri nahin samajhataa kyonki wo to ladaai main hi nahin he
 Also, on the day of February 11 when the first phase of voting will take place, Rahul, Akhilesh will be doing a 5-hour shared road show in pm's parliamentary constituency, Banaras, to influence the first phase of western UP voting
 mayawati kaa jat land plan2007 main dalit-brahman sameekaran banaakar siem banane vaali mayawati ne is baar apni ranneeti badal di he
 Then BJP was not a big challenge for Mayawati
 is baar mayawati nai ranneeti ke saath chunavi maidan main utrin hai
 This time Mayawati has formed the basis of the dalit-muslim equation, whose biggest test is to be done in western UP itself
 mayawati yahaan se 100 se zyada muslim ummidavaar utaar chuki hai
 Mayawati is more aggressive on the BJP during the election campaign
 yahaan tak ki, muslimon ko sandesh dene ke liye bahubali or daagi chhavi vaale ansaari bandhuon se bhi unhone haath mila liya, jinaki daagi chhavi ke chalate akhilesh, mulaayam-shivpal se takraaye or unako sapa main shaamil nahin hone diya
 In such a situation, like the alliance now, Mayawati wants to make the fight BSP vs BJP
 maaya ko lagata he ki, aise main dalit base vot ke maddenjar 100 muslim ummidavaaron ke sahare vodalit muslim gathjod banaakar bijepi virodhaka vot bhi hasil kar paaengi
 That is why Mayawati says that the Congress is nowhere and the SP is defeating the SP due to the quarrel in the SP, so to vote for the alliance to defeat the BJP is to spoil the vote
 bijepi kii sidhi-sapaat niteebaspa or gathbandhan jitna muslim matadaataaon kii baaten karte hai, bijepi ko lagata he ki, bina kuch kiye hindu matadaata uske paksh main lamaband ho jaaenge, jisase wo dalit vot bank main bhi sendhamari kar legi
 At the same time, he hopes that, the BSP has fielded more than 100 Muslim candidates, while Akhilesh has decided to tie up with the Congress that the Muslim electorate will split two places and the path of BJP will become easier
 saath bijepi ko lagata he ki, uske paas narendra modi bataur turup kaa ikkaa bhi maujuud hai
 Overall, the foundation of who will win the UP riots will be laid from western UP itself
 saath hi sabhi ko lagata he ki, saat charnon ke chunaav main shuruaati charan jo aage nikalegaa, aane vaale charnon main bhi maahaul uske haq main banataa jaayegaa
 That is why at present, Western UP is ready to play an important role in deciding the political direction of the entire UP

 Demonetisation completed one year
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki saal bhar unhone sirf maar jheli he
 Farmers allege that cashless transactions have also done their worst
 aise hi ek kisaan kaa puraa saal kaise beetaa
 
 
 Aaj Tak tried to understand this
 pune ke mukhya sabji mandi jane par maaloom hua ki in dinon pyaaj ke bazaar main teji ai hui he
 The reason given was that due to continuous rains last month, the new onion crop has been destroyed and hence the farmers who had kept the old onion are making good profits
 ahmednagar jile ke sangavi surya gaanv main pyaaj kii fasal ugane vaala vinayak kothaale kisaan ke pyaaj ko chalis rupaya kilo kaa bhav mila he
 But despite this, his face is not happy
 ahmednagar jile se aae kisaan vinayak kothaale ke mutabik notebandi ke kaaran ab kisaan ko fasal ke paise bahut deree se milane shuru ho gaye hai
 You will not get the cash money, and the check will also come after one month
 vyapaaree ko fasal bechney ke ek maheene baad check miltaa he uske aath din baad check paas hota he
 Due to which, Vinayak has a lot of problems in running the house and giving money to the laborers working in agriculture
 yahi haal anya kisaanon kaa bhi he
 Farmers say that there has been a lot of loss of farmers due to demonetisation
 khet main jo kaam karne vaale majdoor hai wo padhe-likhe nahin hone se unke acount kaa check dena yaa phir RTGS karne ke liye wo sahamat nahin hote
 That is why they have to pay cash and if they get two thousand notes from the bank then it is going to be difficult
 kisaan bhachhindra bhakere bataate hai, "notebandi ke pehle kisaakpana maal kheti ke baandh par bechata tha lekin ab vyapaaree kheti main maal kharidne nahin aate
 It is difficult to transfer money
 vyapaaree hamen check detaa he to 20 din tak check clear nahin hota
 The farmer is in great need of money
 aaj pyaaj ko thodaa sa bhav mila he lekin pichley saal kuch bhi bhav nahin tha
 Neither did the principal leave
 "ahmednagar jile ke sangavi surya gaanv main kisaan apana gujara kaise karte hai ye jaanane 'ajtak' kii team us ilaake main bhi pahunchi
 It was found that most of the farmers live on the crop and the income earned by selling it twice a year, demonetisation as well as cashless transactions, other farmers like Vinayak are facing double whammy
 govind dhumal or unke parivaar ke paas paise nahin hone ke kaaran unhen guzaara karnaa bhi mushkil ho rahaa he
 The story of Govind Dhumal is also the same
 unhen check se pement karne se do-do maheenon tak paise nahin milte
 Due to which their condition is bad
 unka kahana he ki is baar barish acchhee hui he
 The crop has also turned out well
 lekin paise na milane se unhen do din bank main janaa padataa he or cashles system oparate karnaa naa aane ki vajah se unhen ek vyapaaree ne ek saal se paisa nahin diya he
 He does not even know to write checks, which has spoiled his ten checks
 time par mazdooron ko paise naa dene se majdoor bhi pareshaan hai
 Govind Dhumal also narrated the condition of the farmers for one year, "cultivate onions, grow two-four acres of onions, the cost is high but the price is not much
 check aata he vyapaaree se lekin paisa nahin mil rahaa
 Because check bounce also happens
 pement aane main let ho jaataa he
 The laborers do not stay that many days
 paisa jaldi nahin aata to majdoor rukate nahin hai
 It also becomes difficult to spend the house
 petrol, dijal or baaki ke kharchon kaa problem ho jaataa he
 When the laborers leave, it becomes difficult to load
 aisi bahut dikkat he
 "the laborers working in agriculture also have bad conditions
 ujjwala rajaraam dhavle ne bataaya ki kaise unhen check se pement miltaa he or phir khet ke jo majdoor kaam karte hai unhen roj roti khaane ke liye roj paise lagate hai
 There are very small problems
 kheti se jude logon ke khaane ke bahut waande chal rahe hai
 Laborers-farmers and traders are trapped between demonetisation and cashless transactions
 majdoor pareshaan hai ki kisaan paisa nahin detaa
 The farmer is upset that the merchant is giving the check late
 vyapaaree pareshaan he ki haath main cash nahin to- kisaanon ko khaali he bhejnaa pad rahaa he
 On the whole, despite the boom in the market after a year, the farmers are not happy
 pune, ahmednagar, nasik jaise halaat sirf pashchimi maharashtra tak simit nahin hai puure rajya ke sabji mandiyon main aaj bhi cash nahin ke baraabar dikhaai detaa he
 Due to not getting the money in hand, the difficulty starting from the market reaches the house of farmers and laborers and gets bigger
 kisaanon ke mutabik pichley ek saal se kheti par nirbhar log apana pet katkar jindagi ji rahe hai

 Huffington post ke akshay deshmane ne ej of duing bijness kii daavedaari ko lekar ek lambii story kii he
 Akshay has written that for this report, he has seen hundreds of pages of meetings minutes
 kai pramukh logon se baat kii he or sarkari patrachaar ko bhi dekha he tab jaakar yah report kii he
 The report appeared on 20 November
 report yah he ki kaise modi sarkaar ne ranking main sudhaar laane ke liye vishwa bank ke saath lobing kar ranking kii prakriya main badlaav karavaaya
 When it did not succeed, some minor reforms tried to regain the ranking
 lavish bhandari jaise arthshaastriyon kaa kahana he ki badale main bharat ke aarthik sudhaaron ko vishwa bank ne prabhavit kiya
 Akshay has obtained several documents from the Right to Information, showing how Finance Minister Jaitley has improved the ranking by using the current tricks of competitive examination and has not made any concrete changes
 isse arthvyavastha ko khaas laabh bhi nahin hua
 Arvind Maryam, who was the finance secretary in the early phase of Modi government, has questioned why investment is not increasing if the ranking is improving
 2011 main jidipi kaa 38 pratishat nivesh hota tha tab to ej of duingi bijness main bharat kii ranking bhi acchhee nahin thi lekin 2018 main jab bahut acchhee ho gai tab nivesh jidipi kaa 27 fisadi kyon he
 Read and understand this report yourself
 bijness standard main 26 november ke rose ishan bakshi kii report karmchaaree bhavishyanidhi fund (EPFO) ke aankadon ko lekar he
 Based on the number of employees joining it, it is being claimed that people are getting jobs
 data se pataa chalata he ki yah sankhya isliye badi hui dikh rahi he ki pradhanmantri rojgaar protsaahan yojana (PMRPY) ke kaaran company ko sarkaar se anudaan miltaa he
 People who were already employed for this benefit are mostly connected
 isse pataa nahin chalata he ki nai naukariyaan badi hai yaa pehle se kaam kar rahe log hi yojana kaa laabh lene ke liye jude hai
 Ishaan has written that most people with salary below 15000 get the benefit of PMRPY
 isse bhi pataa chalata he ki kis level kii aupchaarik naukariyon kaa srijan ho rahaa he
 It will also have to be seen that after three years, when the government stops depositing its share, then will the companies deposit these part of these employees in the EPFO or remove them from work
 aap jaanate hai ki sarkaar ne teen saal tak companiyon ke hisse ko jamaa karne kaa niyam banaaya he
 The government is giving the share that has to be given to the companies
 ek tarah se sarkaar janata kaa paisa dekar, janata ke liye aankade kharid rahi he, rojgaar nahin de rahi he
 PMRPY was launched in August 2016
 pehle saal main ise lekar khaasaa utsaah nahin tha
 Only 425,636 new beneficiaries joined EPFO
 sitambar 2017 se sitambar 2018 ke bich yah sankhya tezi se badi he
 About 80 lakh beneficiaries are connected
 nae data se pataa chalata he ki PMRPY ke tahat nae labhaarthi kii sankhya 74 lakh he
 While the number of people joining EPFO in this one year is only 8 million
 oktober 2018 tak PMRPY ke tahat panjikrut sansthaanon kii sankhya he 1,27,122 he
 74 lakh new beneficiaries have been added
 to ausatan ek santhaan main 62 karmchaaree judate hai
 The average number of employees in the Annual Survey of Industry (ASI) data is equivalent to those working in institutions registered with PMRPY
 aap hindi ke akhabaaron main aisi padtaal nahin dekhenge
 It is better that you also look at this report and discuss its shortcomings or merits
 mujhe kai dinon se ek darshak mitra is bare main samajha rahe hai
 We cannot understand every subject, but what they have written and told me, i am placing before you
 unhone ek udhaaharan diya ki madhya pradesh main niyam he ki sarkari tender main vahi thekedaar hissaa legaa jisane 20 logon kaa EPFO main panjikaran karaayaa he
 As a result of this, the contractor started showing the relatives of the employee to the friend to take the tender
 unka ek maheene kaa vetan jamaa kar diya
 The EPFO rules that after depositing one month's salary, his account remains active for 36 months
 bhale aap uske baad kuch na jamaa karen
 This increased the figures but did not increase employment
 ek zile main ausatan 300 prakaar ke thekedaar hote hai
 In the figures, 6000 jobs were created in this way, but how much actually happened is doubtful
 kai baar santhaan 15 din kii hi selary dete hai or kaam dena band kar dete hai magar uskaa panjikaran EPFO main rahata he
 In the data you will see that one has got employment and the arrangement is being formalized but where has it been formalized
 mazaduri mili 20 dinon kii or aankadon main ek rojgaar bad gaya
 We journalists should also look at how many such institutions have come under the ambit of EPFO due to increase of 1 or 2 employees, then the actual increase is 1 or 20
 aap jaanate hai ki 20 se adhik karmchaaree hone par EPFO main panjikaran karana padataa he
 You did not register when there are 19 employees
 magar ek nayaa aayaa to aapako karana pad gaya
 This 20 jobs will be seen in the account, but the reality is that 19 were already working
 har santhaan ko har maheene karmchaariyon kaa hissaa jamaa karana hota he
 This is called ECR REMITTENCE
 ek tarah kii prapti raseed hui
 But when you IWU

 Provident Fund Organization has 120 offices across the country
 100 se adhik karyaalayon ne unke kaaryakshetra main aane vaale sanghathanon kii taaja jaankaree hi nahin di he
 This is the situation when it is mandatory to do so
 to aap nahin jaanch paaenge ki kisi company main oktober maheene main 20 log the to november main 20 hi hai yaa kam ho gaye
 So you will not know how much employment was created
 kai companiyaan aisi hoti hai jo ek hi maheene kaa data jamaa karti hai

 The Business Standard reports Ishaan Bakshi's November 26 Daily Employee Provident Fund (EPFO) data
 isse judane vaale karmchaariyon kii sankhya ke aadhaar par daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki logon ko naukariyaan mil rahi hai
 The data shows that this number is seen to increase because the company gets a government grant due to the Pradhan Mantri Rozgar Protsahan Yojana (PMRPY)
 is laabh ke liye jo log pehle se naukari main the vahi zyaadaatar jude hai
 It does not show that new jobs have increased or people already working are involved to take advantage of the scheme
 ishan ne likhaa he ki zyaadaatar 15000 se kam kii selary vaale logon ko PMRPY kaa laabh miltaa he
 This also shows at which level formal jobs are being created
 yah bhi dekhnaa hoga ki teen saal baad jab sarkaar apana hissaa jamaa karnaa band kar degi tab kya companiyaan in karmchaariyon ko EPFO main inkaa hissaa jamaa karaayengi yaa phir inhen kaam se hataa dengi
 You know that the government has made a rule to freeze the share of companies for three years
 jo hissaa companiyon ko dena he, wo sarkaar de rahi he
 In a way, by giving money to the public, the government is buying data for the public, not giving employment
 agast 2016 main PMRPY launch hui thi
 In the first year there was not much enthusiasm about it
 maatr 425,636 nae labhaarthi EPFO se jude
 This number increased rapidly between September 2017 and September 2018
 kareeb 80 lakh labhaarthi jude hai
 New data shows that the number of new beneficiaries under PMRPY is 74 lakhs
 jabaki is ek saal main EPFO se judane waalon kii sankhya kareeb 80 lakh hi he
 As of October 2018 the number of institutions registered under PMRPY is 1,27,122
 74 lakh nae labhaarthi jude hai
 So on an average, 62 employees are added to an institute
 anual survey of industry (ASI) ke aankadon main jo ausat karmchaariyon kii sankhya nikalati he wo PMRPY main panjikrut sansthaanon main kaam karne vaale logon ke baraabar hi he
 You will not see such an investigation in Hindi newspapers
 behatar he aap bhi is rapat ko dekhen or isaki kamiyon yaa khoobiyon par vichaar vimarsh karen
 i have been explaining this to an audience friend for several days
 ham log har vishay ko nahin samaj sakate hai magar jo unhone likhaa he or mujhe bataaya he main aapke saamne rakh rahaa hum
 He gave an example that in Madhya Pradesh there is a rule that the same contractor who has registered 20 people in EPFO will participate in the government tender
 isse hua yah ki thekedaar tender lene ke liye dost rishtedaaron ko karmchaaree kii jagah dikhaane lage
 Submitted their one month's salary
 EPFO kaa niyam he ki ek maheene kaa vetan jamaa karne ke baad uskaa khaataa 36 maheene tak sakriy rahata he
 Even if you don't collect anything after that
 isse aankade to bad gaye lekin rojgaar nahin badha
 There are an average of 300 types of contractors in a district
 aankadon main is tarah 6000 rojgaar paidaa ho gaya lekin asal main kitna hua, is par andeh he
 Many times the institutes pay 15 days salary and stop giving work, but their registration remains in EPFO
 data main aapako dikhegaa ki ek ko rojgaar mila he or vyavastha aupchaarik ho rahi he magar yah aupchaarik kahaan hui
 The wage was 20 days and the figure increased by one employment
 ham patrakaron ko yah bhi dekhnaa chahie aise kitne santhaan hai jo 1 yaa 2 karmchaariyon kii vruddhi ke kaaran EPFO ke daayre main aae, tab vaastavik vruddhi 1 he yaa 20
 You know that there are more than 20 employees who have to register with EPFO
 19 karmchaaree hai tab aapane panjikaran nahin karaayaa
 But you had to do a new one
 khate main yah 20 rojgaar dikhegaa lekin vaastaviktaa to yahi he ki 19 to pehle se hi kaam kar rahe the
 Every institute has to deposit its share of employees every month
 ise ECR REMITTENCE kehete hai

 oktober 2018 tak PMRPY ke tahat panjikrut sansthaanon kii sankhya he 1,27,122 he
 74 lakh new beneficiaries have been added
 to ausatan ek santhaan main 62 karmchaaree judate hai
 The average number of employees in the Annual Survey of Industry (ASI) data is equivalent to those working in institutions registered with PMRPY
 aap hindi ke akhabaaron main aisi padtaal nahin dekhenge
 It is better that you also look at this report and discuss its shortcomings or merits
 mujhe kai dinon se ek darshak mitra is bare main samajha rahe hai
 We cannot understand every subject, but what they have written and told me, i am placing before you
 unhone ek udhaaharan diya ki madhya pradesh main niyam he ki sarkari tender main vahi thekedaar hissaa legaa jisane 20 logon kaa EPFO main panjikaran karaayaa he
 As a result of this, the contractor started showing the relatives of the employee to the friend to take the tender
 unka ek maheene kaa vetan jamaa kar diya
 The EPFO rules that after depositing one month's salary, his account remains active for 36 months
 bhale aap uske baad kuch na jamaa karen
 This increased the figures but did not increase employment
 ek zile main ausatan 300 prakaar ke thekedaar hote hai
 In the figures, 6000 jobs were created in this way, but how much actually happened is doubtful
 kai baar santhaan 15 din kii hi selary dete hai or kaam dena band kar dete hai magar uskaa panjikaran EPFO main rahata he
 In the data you will see that one has got employment and the arrangement is being formalized but where has it been formalized
 mazaduri mili 20 dinon kii or aankadon main ek rojgaar bad gaya
 We journalists should also look at how many such institutions have come under the ambit of EPFO due to increase of 1 or 2 employees, then the actual increase is 1 or 20
 aap jaanate hai ki 20 se adhik karmchaaree hone par EPFO main panjikaran karana padataa he
 You did not register when there are 19 employees
 magar ek nayaa aayaa to aapako karana pad gaya
 This 20 jobs will be seen in the account, but the reality is that 19 were already working
 har santhaan ko har maheene karmchaariyon kaa hissaa jamaa karana hota he
 This is called ECR REMITTENCE
 ek tarah kii prapti raseed hui
 But when you IWU

 100 se adhik karyaalayon ne unke kaaryakshetra main aane vaale sanghathanon kii taaja jaankaree hi nahin di he
 This is the situation when it is mandatory to do so
 to aap nahin jaanch paaenge ki kisi company main oktober maheene main 20 log the to november main 20 hi hai yaa kam ho gaye
 So you will not know how much employment was created
 kai companiyaan aisi hoti hai jo ek hi maheene kaa data jamaa karti hai

 i have been explaining this to an audience friend for several days
 ham log har vishay ko nahin samaj sakate hai magar jo unhone likhaa he or mujhe bataaya he main aapke saamne rakh rahaa hum
 He gave an example that in Madhya Pradesh there is a rule that the same contractor who has registered 20 people in EPFO will participate in the government tender
 isse hua yah ki thekedaar tender lene ke liye dost rishtedaaron ko karmchaaree kii jagah dikhaane lage
 Submitted their one month's salary
 EPFO kaa niyam he ki ek maheene kaa vetan jamaa karne ke baad uskaa khaataa 36 maheene tak sakriy rahata he
 Even if you don't collect anything after that
 isse aankade to bad gaye lekin rojgaar nahin badha
 There are an average of 300 types of contractors in a district
 aankadon main is tarah 6000 rojgaar paidaa ho gaya lekin asal main kitna hua, is par andeh he
 Many times the institutes pay 15 days salary and stop giving work, but their registration remains in EPFO
 data main aapako dikhegaa ki ek ko rojgaar mila he or vyavastha aupchaarik ho rahi he magar yah aupchaarik kahaan hui
 The wage was 20 days and the figure increased by one employment
 ham patrakaron ko yah bhi dekhnaa chahie aise kitne santhaan hai jo 1 yaa 2 karmchaariyon kii vruddhi ke kaaran EPFO ke daayre main aae, tab vaastavik vruddhi 1 he yaa 20
 You know that there are more than 20 employees who have to register with EPFO
 19 karmchaaree hai tab aapane panjikaran nahin karaayaa
 But you had to do a new one
 khate main yah 20 rojgaar dikhegaa lekin vaastaviktaa to yahi he ki 19 to pehle se hi kaam kar rahe the
 Every institute has to deposit its share of employees every month

 Shoaib Akhtar, popularly known as Pakistan's Dhakkar bowler and Rawalpindi Express, has opposed the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir
 akhtar ne vahi jhootha daawa doharaaya, jo akasar pakistani sarkaar karti rahati he ki kashmir main bharat sarkaar nagarikon par atyaachaar kar rahi he
 Akhtar shared a photo on social media, which has a picture of a baby girl, who is blindfolded

 Assistance of Rs
 unki license fees bhi maaf kar di jaaegi or unhen bijli kaa bhi kam shulk dena hoga
 These bailouts of Mamta Banerjee have come as a gift of Durga Puja especially to rural communities
 haalanki ek ke baad ek siyaasi partiyon ne rajya main durga puja ko sangrakshan diya he, magar ve itane udaar kabhi nahin rahe
 Due to these dues, an expenditure of 28 crores rupees is expected to be incurred on the treasury of the government
 yah un 640 karod rupye ke alaava hoga jo kolkata main pichley chah saal se koi 16,000 youth klbon ko die ja rahe hai
 The Gaddinshin Trinamool Congress government in the state is using this opportunity to strengthen its 'hindu' credibility with aggressive BJP
 mamata maanati hai ki is kadam se unke khilaaf 'muslim tushtikaran' kaa bhagava party kaa aarope feekaa or kamjor pad jayega
 Most of the worship committees have people from different professions, castes, communities and political parties
 iskaa matlab he ki gaddinshin tiemasi alag-alag varg ke logon—or voton—se sidhe judegi
 Veteran Congress leader Arunabh Ghosh says that the state government has taken this step in order to benefit the TMC cadre, who are mostly on the worship committees
 revolutionari socialist party of india ke netaa ashok ghosh kehete hai, ''yah sarkaar kanoon or samvidhan kii jaraa bhi izzat nahin karti
 Ghosh has also filed a PIL in the Calcutta High Court
 vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki gramin ilaakon main durga puja samitiyon ko rakam dene kaa mamata kaa faisla bhaajapa kii nakal he jisane pichley saal hajaar se zyada gaanv str ke puja utsavon ko paisa diya tha
 Ravindra Bharti University scholar Vishwanath Chakraborty says this is an "exercise to compensate for the loss" that followed the bjp's campaign in which saffron leaders, including Amit Shah, favored Muslim festivals over Mamata over Durga Puja
 Was accused of
 kanoonee visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki mukhyamantri kii puja kii khayraton ko adalati aalochana kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 In the same way as the 2012 payment of monthly stipends to Muslim Imams and Mu'ajins, the High Court had stayed in 2013
 yah maanate hue ki adaalatein puja kii khayraton ko radd kar sakati hai, tiemasi ke ek mantri kehete hai, ''is kadam se sandesh gaya he ki ham secular hai or ham utane hi hindu hai jitna hindu hone kaa kuch partiyaan daawa kar rahi hai
 Meanwhile, there were reports that the Majerhat bridge that collapsed on 4 September had collapsed because the state's finance department delayed releasing Rs 2 crore for its repair and maintenance
 aise main vipakshi dalon ne rajya sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki vah jan suraksha ko lekar laaparvaah he, jabaki vot bainkon ko majboot karne par khule haathon se paisa baha rahi he
 Whatever accusations Mamata Banerjee makes and even if these Durga Puja speeches are stopped, her message will reach the voters just before the elections, who were being persuaded through various means that Mamata Banerjee loots more Mamata on Muslims Huh

 It will be a burden on the state exchequer, because of the revolutions of Durga Puja of Mamta *** film kaa naam : bareli kii barfediarector: ashvini ayyar tiwaristar cast: rajkumaar raav, ayushmaan khurana, kriti sinan, pankaj treepathi, seemaa paahvivadhi:2 ghanta 02 minutesrtificate: u / aretimga: 3 stared agency ke becoground main kaam kar chukin ashvini ayyar tiwari kii pehali film nil bate sannata ko hi kaaphi saraahaa gaya tha
 However, according to the business, the film could not run
 lekin bareli kii barfi ke saath ashvini ne chote shahar kii kahani ke saath is baar thodi zyada camershal film banaai he
 Let's see how much she can earn! The story of Bitti of small town This story is of Mishra family of Bareilly in which Bitti (kriti Sanon) lives with her mother (seema Pahwa) and father (pankaj Tripathi)
 bitti ke maa-baap uski shaadi karana chaahate hai lekin ladakevaalon kii ore se baar-baar ajeeb se sawaal puche jane kii vajah se bitti ghar se bhaagane kaa prayaas karti he
 Meanwhile, he gets a book called Bareilly's Barfi and falls in love with his writer Pritam Vidrohi (rajkumar Rao)
 phir preetam kii talash main bitti kii mulaakaat printing press ke maalik chiraag dube (ayushmaan khurana) se hoti he
 With these interactions, the story moves forward and as the trailer itself suggests - Love becomes Triangle
 kapil sharma ne kyon nahin kiya amitabh bachchan ke saath KBC kaa shootakismen he bareli kii barfi kaa swathshvini ayyar tiwari kaa diarection kaaphi acha he or loketions ke lihaaj se lagata he ki aap usee shahar main maujuud hai jahaan yah puri kahani ghat rahi he
 The camera work is good and the shooting method is also good
 film ke dialogs kii khaastaur par tarif kii jaani chahie jo lagaataar darshakon ko hansaate hai
 In many places, even after the end of the scene, a smile remains on the face
 pankaj treepathi or seemaa paahwa ne parents ke rup main behtareen kaam kiya he or hameshaa kii tarah is baar bhi hansaane ke saath-saath dil jeetne main bhi kaamyaab hote hai
 Waheenkriti Sanon is playing in a different avatar and after this film she will definitely be chosen for different characters
 haalanki kai jagah vah kangana ranot ko copy karti dikhti hai
 At the same time, Ayushman Khurana has been accumulating in such films before and this time also his work is effortless
 lekin best kahe jaaenge rajkumaar raav
 There are so many of his punches that you remember till the end
 jaane kisi film thi kriti or sushant kii rabta
 
 
 As far as the songs are concerned, the music of the film is fine and especially Sweety Tera
 
 
 song film kii relies se pehle hit he
 The twist is worth listening to
 lekin complit album ke taur par bareli kii barfi bahut yaad kiye jane vaala sangeet nahin detii he
 It spoils here: Test Bareilly's icy Climax is quite predictable
 ise or ksaa ja saktaa tha
 In the second part, the film is a bit boring
 lambaai ko bevajaah na badhaakar ise durust kiya ja saktaa tha
 The budget of the box office figures film is being told to be 20 to 25 crores and at the same time the toilet is a love story already running in many theaters
 lekin bahubali jaisi filmon ke distributor anil thadani ke hone kii vajah se film ko acchhee relies milane kii ummid he
 If the audience gets the right appreciation, then the film has full scope of earning well

 In an interview, Khurshid said that the increasing tension on the border required highly responsible, sensitive and restrained behavior

 Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav, along with leaders of Left parties and Telugu Desam Party, is sitting on a dharna in the Parliament complex
 mulaayam singh yadav ne sansad main saamaanya sthiti behaal kiye jane or is mudde par charchaa karaane ke liye dharne par baithne kaa faisla kiya he
 He is demanding cancellation of the licenses issued for coal allocation, and wants a high-level inquiry into the matter
 mulaayam yah bhi daawa kar rahe hai ki bijedy or ediemke bhi is maamle main unke saath hai
 The comments darasal, yah puri kavayad left or sapa ko isliye raas aa rahi he, kyonki mulaayam phir se us tisare morche kaa sapana dekh rahe hai, jo unako pradhanmantri pad tak pahunchaa de

 Mulayam Singh Yadav has decided to sit on the dharna to restore normalcy in Parliament and discuss the issue
 vah koyala aavanton ke liye jari kiye gaye licenson ko radd kiye jane kii maang kar rahe hai, saath hi chaahate hai ki is maamle kii ucch-stareey jaanch ho
 Mulayam is also claiming that BJD and AIADMK are also with him in this matter
 tippaniyan Actually, this whole exercise is going to the Left and the SP because Mulayam is again dreaming of a third front which will lead him to the post of Prime Minister
 1996 main sansad main teesraa sabase bada dal hone ke naate janata dal ne apana pradhanmantri banaaya tha
 The mid-term survey of NDTV suggests that SP may also be the third largest party in the Lok Sabha
 gauratlab he ki kol-get prakaran ko lekar pichley kareeb do saptaah se sansad main koi kaamkaaj nahin ho sakaa he
 The BJP is firm on the demand for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's resignation on the issue
 endie sahyogi jediu or akali dal samet anya vipakshi dal bhi sansad kii kaarywahi baadhit karne ke paksh main nahin hai or is maamle main kaig kii report par charchaa karnaa chaahate hai
 The Prime Minister, however, in his statement in Parliament has described some of the assessments of this report as faulty and controversial

 Former captain of the Indian cricket team, Sunil Gavaskar is today celebrating his 68th birthday
 bhartiya cricket team main gavaskar ke yogadan ko nahin bhulaayaa ja saktaa
 He has been one of the greatest batsmen in the world
 gavaskar ek defensive ballebaaj the or unki is peeche saahas, jujharupan tha jo unhen duniya ke duusare ballebaajon se alag karata tha
 The first Test match was played on 6 March 1971, Gavaskar played his first Test match in 1971 against the world's strongest West Indies
 unhone us mukaable main bina kisi chauke or chakke kii madad se 65 ran banaae the
 It was a period when the West Indies used to be the strongest team in the world
 westeindies ke paas behad hi khaufnak tej gendbaaj the
 Batting in front of whom was not easy and Gavaskar played very memorable innings against those bowlers without a helmet
 ballebaaji karte samay gavaskar kii timming or shot sillection gajab kaa hota tha
 Gavaskar made the Indian team strong When the Indian team was considered very weak when Gavaskar stepped into international cricket
 lekin gavaskar ne apni jujharu ballebaaji se bhartiya team ko ek aisi team main badal diya
 Which was not easy to beat
 bemisaal rahaa he gavaskar kaa recordgavaskar ne 125 test match kii 214 pariyon main 51
 10122 runs at an average of 12
 jisamen unke 34 shatak or 45 ardhashatak shaamil the
 Also 35 out of 108 odis
 13 kii ausat se 3092 ran banaae jisamen unka ek shatak or 27 ardhashatak shaamil rahe
 Gavaskar was followed by many batsmen whose records were better than him
 lekin gavaskar gavaskar kii jagah koi nahin le saktaa
 After the defeat of Delhi, the Prime Minister is seen drowning in the World Cup
 kal guuruuvaar ko hi team india or uske tamaam khilaadiyon ke naam pradhanmantri ne apane twitor handle se 16 twit kar na sirf in khilaadiyon ko cap jeet kar laane kii shubhakamanaayen deen, balki harek khilaadi ke majboot paksh kii taareef karte hue unki hausala afazai kii koshish bhi kii
 On Friday morning, he tweeted four more and said that he has greeted Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, and Sri Lanka's newly elected President Sirisena to wish them World Cup
 pakistan ke saath dwipaksheeya baatcheet sthagit he or aise main phone par is baatcheet kii apni ahmiyat he
 Its diplomatic importance also because information has been coming from America that it is constantly asking India to open the way to dialogue with Pakistan
 kair, is baar bharat samet 5 saarc deshon kii team world cap main hissaa le rahi hai or is mauqe par pradhanmantri ne ek bada kootnithik elaan bhi kiya he
 That is, they will soon send the new Foreign Secretary of the country, s Jaishankar, on a 'SAARC Yatra' to strengthen mutual agreements between SAARC countries
 world cap main kisi pradhanmantri kii dilchaspee koi nai baat nahin he
 For the betterment of mutual relations, the Prime Minister of India and the Prime Minister or President of Pakistan (whoever has the power) have sat together and watched cricket matches many times
 ise donon deshon ke bich cricket diplomasi kaa naam diya jaataa he
 There has also been a trend for the Prime Minister to wish the Indian team well before big events like World Cup
 lekin pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa cricket world cap ko lekar ek ke baad ek 20 twit karnaa kaasi dilchaspee paidaa karata he
 Is Prime Minister Modi trying to relax after Delhi's defeat and Cricket World Cup is giving him this opportunity? Does he want to find his lost place in the news through this, because only Modi was running in TV and newspapers and now only Kejriwal is running? Does he want to take 'public attraction to the other side' once again by focusing on opium-like cricket in India? Want to look foolish with defeat? There are many questions to which the short answer is probably yes
 darasal, arvind kejariwal kii baari jeet ne modi kii jeet ke saamne ek badi lakeer khinch di
 And this line is not even straight, but Modi's line has been pulled by cutting
 haalanki ek bada antar ye he ki modi loksabhaa chunaav main puraa desh jite the, kejariwal ne abhi sirf dilli jiti he
 But this is not just a political fight
 paracepshan kii ladaai bhi he, jisamen media ek ahm bhoomika nibhaa rahaa he
 The way one section of the media was engaged in his victory after Modi's victory, similarly the other section has joined Kejriwal's victory after his victory
 kejariwal chadhate dikh rahe hai
 Modi is seen descending
 tivi aadhaarit lokapriyata se bane vyaktitvon ke liye ye utaar-chadhaav khaas myne rakhata he
 Especially when they realize that according to the promises, the work has not been done on the ground either and if anything has happened then people have not got their reward
 janata ko rajanetaaon kii koshishon se utana matlab nahin hota jitna nateezon se hota he
 Kejriwal's success has not been achieved as much by the efforts made during the previous government of 49 days as he has been able to give some results on the ground
 jaise bijli, pani ke daam main kami or pulisia vasuuli par roak
 That is why maybe now Modi has realized that if the future land is to be built and saved, then the media will need an uproar and work on the land will also have to be done
 "hamaare gaanv, hamaare shahar, hamaare gali, hamaare mohalle, hamaare skool hamaare aspataal" kii safai kaa udghosh karte vigyaapan ke sur aajkal dhime pad gaye hai
 The broom has given a different call
 modi apane bhaashanon main itane saare vaade kharch kar chuke hai ki bihar or phir bengal ke chunaavon main wo nayaa kya bolenge, ye soch kar main chintat hone laga hum
 There is also a question whether they will be able to regain the same rhythm and rhythm with the same confidence that the election results of Delhi have transformed? Now, perhaps he will never be able to wear his name-written suit, which made him less of a fortune than a fortune
 yaad kiijie ki loksabhaa chunaav se pehle 20-20 match ke nateezon kii tarah wo ‘vikaas’ dene kii baat kar rahe the
 When he came to power, he started demanding to pull the match to 50–50 overs for better results
 ‘thodaa vakt to dijie
 Gave Congress sixty years, give us sixty months
 
 
 media ne sau din kaa honeymoon period bhi nahin diya
 
 
 etc etc'
 vaise kejariwal bhi vaadon ke free hit ke saath satta main pahunche hai
 This time on the wet land of Delhi, he will have to try his feet
 is baar team puri he
 Not a single player is injured or injured
 is baar phisalane kaa koi bahaanaa nahin chalegaa
 And this match of Kejriwal with Modi has forced the two Twenty20 players to enter the 'test Match'
 ruk kar, har ball dekh kar, tik kar, zarurat pade to baikfoot par jaakar, kamazor ball ko parakh kar or achche ball ko uchit sammaan dekar, atirikt khatara uthaane kii hadabdaahat ke bina donon ko batting karnaa he
 Your score has to be increased
 toss jeet kar kejariwal ne abhi strike sanbhali he
 At first he was seen in excitement, but this time he seems to be trying to balance the regression born of victory
 acha parfarm karne ke liye ye zaruri he
 On the other hand, Modi has yet to field for a few days
 aisi jagah fielding kerani he, jahaan ve maidan main bhi daudte-bhaagate dikhen or tivi par bhi aaen
 Every mistake of Fielding will be seen repeatedly by action replays
 khaastaur par tab jab pavilion ke thik bagal vaale stand main sangh bhi baithkar match dekh rahaa he
 Every mistake of Modi will give Kejriwal an extra run
 vaise bhi kejariwal ko do vikaton ke bich tezi se daud kar ek ran nikaalane main maharath hasil kar chuke hai
 It gives strength in Test matches
 vaise kejariwal kamazor ball par chakka maar kar ampire se use ‘no ball’ qaraar dene kaa jor bhi daalate karte hai taaki ek ball main wo saat ran juta saken
 We have seen how Kejriwal took advantage of the negative campaign overthrow in the result of the Delhi match
 unhen aasaani se out karnaa mushkil he
 In such a situation, the presence of bowling and catching catches from both ends will bring the next opportunity for batting for Modi
 isliye modi chaukas ho rahe hai
 If they have recovered from this defeat, they will try to understand them by giving full respect to them in the dressing room instead of putting pressure on their team's players otherwise
 kiran bedi kii tarah baahar se khilaadi laane kii bajaay apane khilaadiyon kii pratibha ko pahchaan kar unhen uske mutabiq mauqaa dene kii koshish karenge
 Just like by tweeting, the praise of every player of Team India is appreciated
 jab ve bhartiya cricket team ke khilaadiyon kii khubi ko is baariki se pahchaan or likh sakate hai to apane mantrimandal ke sadasyon or party ke duusare varisht netaaon ko unki khubi ke hisaab se istemaal kyon nahin kar sakate
 Whether or not this will happen is a different question
 ho saktaa he ki unhen dar hoga ki kahin koi aisa majboot khilaadi na nikal aae jo unki captaini hi chin le
 Well this has been and will continue to happen
 kapil dev se lekar gavaskar tak or azhar, ganguli, tendulkar se lekar dhoni tak, sabko ek na ek din captaini se janaa padataa he
 It remains to be remembered who is the best captain so far
 philhal modi chaahate hai ki media or janata kaa dhyaan modi-kejariwal match se dur rahe
 They need a little time to regurgitate themselves
 isliye wo cricket world cap kii taraf dhyaan le janaa chaah rahe hai
 Cricket is a game in itself, but political players can play it to reinvigorate themselves
 ant main bas itnaa ki, pradhanmantri ji aapane team main josh bharne kii koshish iske liye desh aapkaa shukraguzaar he
 We also have the best of luck that this time you discuss 'tea' with 'world Cup' in hand
 
 
 team india ke saath
 We are watching your tweets
 aapke vyaktitv main jhaankne kaa koi or jharokha aapane choda nahin hua he
 Cool Anushka Sharma, love is love
 kisi bhi team kii jeet mohabbat se badhkar nahin ho sakati he
 It was good that we lost one step before winning the World Cup title
 kisi ne sahi hi kaha he ki aisa desh worldcup khitaab jeetne yaa final main pahunchane ke laayak nahin he
 Anushka Sharma You go to watch every match till this gothic country stops associating a game with a woman for its humor
 jab tak ham is desh ke naagarik kisi khel kii jeet yaa haar ko mahilaon se jodakar dekhnaa na band kar den, tum tab tak us darshakon kii uchhalati bheed main jaati rahanaa
 Even if the cameras follow you
 fasebuk, twitor jonk kii tarah bhale hi tumhaare peeche lagi rahen, par tum is desh ko hamaare jaahilapane kaa ehsaas karaane ke liye jaati rahanaa
 If the betting phase is removed in the history of cricket, there is hardly any player or team that has played to lose
 match main camere ke anoushka sharma kii tarah mudate hi fasebuk, twitor main chutkiyon ke daur shuru ho gaye
 The remaining Kuchi cancer was completed by Virat Kohli for one run
 fasebuk, twitor par aise bhi bevakoof padhane ko naseeb hue jinhone anoushka ko dian tak qaraar de diya
 This is the story of the country that has been heartily associated with the match since morning to become the world winner
 navaratri main maa kii puja kar jeet ke liye dua karne vaale ek mahila se commentnuma maje lene se baj nahin aae
 Anushka, we are very opportunistic
 mauka mila nahin ki apni creativity dikhaane se baj nahin aate hai
 Life should be lived with laughter, we have taken this lesson very seriously
 lekin is hansi ke liye ham kisi kii nijee jindagi par chatkaraa lene se bhi baj nahin aa rahe hai
 The matter is of likes and comments
 apni fasebuk post par 'hahhaha, lol' tip coment kise nahin pasand
 Anushka Sharma or Virat Kohli are coming to see our post
 isliye jo man kare kah do
 Celebrity, you will have to bear this much
 nijee jindagi chupchaap jini thi to himalay chale jaaen
 If you stay in the society, then for the sake of your comments and sense of humor, we will continue to rape commentary
 shame aati he ki ham aisa sochate hai
 Anushka, when Virat Kohli was seen on social media after his dismissal, i was shocked by the lewd comment on you
 ye kisi soch ho gai he, ham sabaki
 Time changed, players and women changed
 2011 main deepika padukon or ab tum
 Everything changed, but our thinking did not change
 main khud bhi cricket fain hum lekin apane desh kii haar ke liye main tumhaare stadium main jane ko to jimmedaar nahin maanata
 As a cricket fan, you too had equal right to go to the stadium and have the right
 anoushka ek baat or he
 We are a little confused people
 ham jo aaj tumhaari khinchaai kar rahe hai
 We were the ones who were seen writing the States on your acting and atrocities against women in the film NH-10
 ham log bade to gaye, maior bhi kahalaane lage
 But for the sake of understanding and our happiness, we still did not forget to take the support of the easiest and weak-looking person
 lekin tum in sab par dhyaan mat dena anoushka
 You keep doing what your mind wants and keep doing it till we rise above the right wrong
 kyonki tumhi ne to ek baar kaha tha,'jo karnaa tha so karnaa tha
 ' khabar he ki vishaal bharadwaj nirdeshit film ‘haidar’ main shahid kapur ko antim kuch drishyon main ronaa tha
