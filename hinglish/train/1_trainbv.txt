 ' The actor said, 'I know that these types of stories are very attractive, but in this case it is really a lie

 haalanki, aisa na hote dekh aakhirkaar abhinayta ko is prakaar kii khabaron ko failane se rokane ke liye aage aana padaa

 worldcup 2019 kaa final muqabla
 The one that was tied and then the super over was also tied
 cricket phens ke liye isse behtareen kya ho saktaa tha
 But the result that came out, it broke the hearts of millions of fans and also gave a chance to bombard the questions on the cricket body ICC
 england worldcup jeeta lekin newjiland kii haar koi pachaa nahin paa rahaa he
 Not only the cricket fans but the veteran players have also raised questions on the decision based on the boundary
 newjiland ke diggaj khilaadi rahe scot styris ne final mukaable ke baad twit kiya
 He wrote that great ICC, you are just a joke
 saaf he ki jis tarah kaa nateeja saamne aayaa, usase wo khush nahin the
 Apart from this, former New Zealand team captain Stephen Fleming also wrote that it was unkind
 inke alaava purv cricketer or bijepi saansad gautam gambhir ne bhi twit kar ICC ke is niyam par nishaanaa saadh diya
 Gambhir called this rule nonsense
 gautam gambhir ne likhaa ki ye kis tarah kaa niyam he, jahaan boundry ke aadhaar par world champion kaa faisla ho rahaa he
 This match was supposed to be a tie
 Don't understand how the game of such proportions, the # cwc19final, is finally decided on who scored the most boundaries
 a ridiculous rule @ ICC
 Should have been a tie
 i want to congratulate both @ BLACKCAPS & @ englandcricketon playing out a nail biting Final
 Both winners imo
 - Gautam Gambhir (@gautamgambhir) July 14, 2019cruel! - Stephen Fleming (@ spfleming7) July 14, 2019nice work @ ICC
 
 
 you are a joke!!!— Scott Styris (@scottbstyris)july 14, 2019worldcup final: match bhi taai, super over bhi taai, to phir kaise jeet gaya england?cricketron ke saath-saath aam phens ne bhi isisi ke is niyam par sawaal khadey kar die
 People wrote on Twitter that when the decision is coming out on the basis of fours and sixes even after the match of 102 overs, then what is the rule
 kya ye koi gali cricket he yaa phir world cap kaa final
 Rules are made to improve the spirit of game, Not to let down, What's the meaning that the two team who hit more 4's would win a game
 It's WC final not a gully match
 Improve your rules @ ICC # iccrules — Rajarahul (@rajarahulsingh) July 15, 2019 While some people wrote that the rules of ICC are better than the rules of ICC
 People are taking about Stokes, Butler but English bowler made them champion if we consider # iccrules— Yogendra Singh (@yogendras02)july 15, 2019jis tarah se antim over main nateeja naa nikalne ke baad super over kii baari ai or vahaan bhi nateeja nahin niklaa
 So New Zealand lost, but people said that ICC should have declared a joint winner if such a situation came
 After Tie in main game
 
 and in Super Over
 There should have been joint winners
 @BLACKCAPS # iccrules— Manish Veerkar (@manishveerkar)july 15, 2019phens ne twitor par likhaa ki 48 match or 46 din ke baad bhi khitaab kaa faisla chauke-chhakkon ke aadhaar par nikal rahaa he
 Faint! 48 matches, 46 days, and the winner is decided by number of boundaries 😆😆 Senseless
 
 # iccrules
 
 🏆 — Syed Arsalan (@ syedars33364238) July 14, 2019 What does the ICC rule say? Actually, according to the ICC rules, if the match is a tie, a super over is played for it
 or agar super over bhi taai ho jaataa he jo final main hua
 Then the decision comes out on the basis of the boundary, that is, the winner of the boundary is the same
 isamen puri pari ke saath-saath super over kii boundry bhi gini jaati hai
 England won on Sunday on this basis
 newzealand ne pehle ballebaaji karke 241 ran banaae or england ko world champion banane ke liye 242 ranon kii jarurat thi
 But England also managed to score 241 runs in 50 overs and the match was tied
 is taai match kaa nateeja nikaalane ke liye super over hua, jisamen england ne 15 ran banaae or baad main newzealand bhi sirf 15 ran hi bana paaya
 So the match was also tied here
 jab koi bhi nateeja nahin niklaa to ‘kiski boundry zyada’ ke aadhaar par match kaa nateeja niklaa
 And England won the World Cup on this basis
 england ne apni pari main kul 26 boundry lagaai or newjiland ne kul 17

 a large number of teachers and students have mobilized against the four-year undergraduate course, while the UGC has also instructed to withdraw the program in two words
 maamla supreme court tak gaya jisane hastkshep karne se inkaar kar diya
 The High Court also refused to hear it immediately
 jaahir he is program ke samarthakon ke paas ab vikalp kam hai
 Out of the total 64 colleges of the university, 57 have given their consent to the three-year course by giving this course
 unhone ujisi ko is babat suchit bhi kar diya he
 Last year, when it was being brought by a handful of Corse DU professors, there was a lot of opposition
 lekin ise sattarudh congress kaa varadahast praapt tha or yah virodh ke baavjood chaatro par lad diya gaya
 It was said that such a course is prevalent in America and students will benefit from it
 lekin course ke virodhiyon dwaara bataaya gaya ki pehle saal kii padhai kaaphi had tak bachakaani thi
 DU is not a modest university and many colleges here fall even less than 90 percent to take admission
 yahaan desh ke sabase medhaavi chaatr aate hai or unke liye is tarah kii padhai kii vyavastha karnaa haasyaaspad he
 But the matter does not end there
 bina course main amul chul badlaav kiye, bina anbhavi shikshakon ke or bina sabaki rajamandi ke is tarah ke chaar varshiya paathyakram ko thope dena saraasar anuchit he
 Everyone knows what is taught in the undergraduate course in universities in India
 yah padhai koi bahut kathin nahin he or iske liye khaas kism kii koi dakshata bhi nahin chahie
 Then justify putting four years for this? If the study is of a particular type or is completely new or if the students studying it are completely clumsy, then the duration of the course should also be extended
 behatar shiksha ke naam par chaar saal kaa course thope dena nisandeh galat he
 But this happened in DU and now the Vice Chancellor Dinesh Singh has come down to politics as soon as a loud voice is raised against it
 pehle to unki ore se istife kii khabar ai or phirakhaamoshi chaa gai
 There are many flaws in the Indian education system
 yahaan shiksha kaa str bahut gir chukaa he or iske liye shikshak bhi kam jimmedaar nahin he
 What good do they want to do for graduate level education by implementing such courses
 agar isamen sudhaar karnaa he to sabase pehle jaruri he ki padhai keghante badaye jaaen
 It is well known that how many days of holidays are in DU in a year and how many days of study
 agar sudhaar karnaa haito sabase pehle chhuttiyon kii sankhya ghatai jaae
 After that the teachers should get refresher course just like the pilots who fly the Jumbo Jet
 course main nae se nae vishay or sandarbh daale jaaen
 Instead, everyone should try to dispute that it should be ranked among the 100 best universities in the world
 abhi to yah top 200 main bhi nahin he
 It is better to increase the controversy that DU gets out of this four-year period
 teen saal ke corse main koi kami nahin thi
 a good plan should be made for implementing it again so that it is included in the best universities of the world
 chaar saal ke course se to yah hone vaala nahinhai
 At this time, thousands of students from every corner of the country are eagerly waiting for the admission to start waiting

 mason ne twit kiya, 'main aaj kii press conference main acosta ke thik bagal main baitha tha or unhen yuva intern par apana haath rakhte nahin dekha
 Maison, a reporter for the news agency Reuters, defended CNN correspondent Acosta, stating that Acosta held the mic until the intern arrived and later posted some pictures of the press conference to prove his point

 Input: IANS rail mantralay ne nai cataring policy kaa draft jari kar diya he
 According to the draft issued, the Railways is going to give a big responsibility to IRCTC in the new catering policy
 nai policy main sabhi jonal railway dwaara pentry car sarvice ke contract iarsitisi ko de die jaaenge
 IRCTC will also be given the responsibility of managing the catering service in all new trains started on short notice
 gauratlab he ki is samay lagu cataring policy varsh 2010 main lagu kii gai thi
 It is believed that previous governments had arbitrarily given most of the railway catering services to private companies, bypassing IRCTC
 iskaa khamiyaja yah hua kii nijee companiyon ne to motaa munafa kamaaya lekin bechararelayatrighatiya khaanaa kha khaakar pareshaan hota rahaa
 In view of the recurring complaints, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu had announced in the budget that he would soon introduce a new catering policy
 apane vaade ko puraa karne ke liye rail mantri prabhu ne tamaam vichaar vimarsh ke baad 2016 kii nai cataring policy kaa draft vichaar vimarsh ke liye saamne rakhaa he
 In the new policy, while on one hand IRCTC is prepared to entrust catering to all trains, on the other hand it is also guaranteed to get delicious food of proper quality at the platform and railway station
 railway ne jahaan ek taraf i-cataring ko badhaava dene kii baat kahi he to vahiin duusari taraf gadiyon main aan board services ko behatar banane ke liye bhi kadam uthaae hai
 To ensure that food is good and there is no compromise in its quality, IRCTC will pick up food from its kitchen for all moving services
 iarsitisi ko railway kii sabhi base kichan saunp di jaaengi
 Apart from this, it is ready to give rights to IRCTC to contract to provide services to big companies of hospitality industry also
 jonal railway ke tahat aane vaali chaaron base kichan nagpur, siasti mumbai, bisiti mumbai or ballarshah ko iarsitisi ko saunp diya jayega
 Apart from this, there is also a plan to give IRCTC the public kitchen and other kitchens available at railway stations
 iske peeche jo sabase badi soch bataai ja rahi he vah soch yah he ki aisa karne se khaane kii quality behatar kii ja sakegi
 a new memorandum of understanding will be signed between the Indian Railways and IRCTC for the management of the catering service
 mobile cataring sarvice ke liye uchit tareeke kii pentricar ko dizin kiya jayega or isi ke saath state of ort technology ke upkarnon ko cataring main shaamil kiya jayega
 Apart from this, Railways has decided to take another major decision
 jiske tahat cataring main platform par or chalati train main dhire-dhire gas chulhaa kaa prachlan khatm kiya jayega or inaki jagah bijli se chalane vaale upkarnon ko tarjeeh di jaaegi
 Simultaneously, the new draft catering policy envisages setting up of mini-pantry equipped with modern gadgets in all Shatabdi and Jan Shatabdi trains or other similar trains
 in sabhi trainon main trollies ke jariye logon ko khaanaa parosane kii taiyaari he
 While IRCTC will take over the responsibility of catering units entrusted on one side, Food Plaza will also take over the functioning of food courts and fast food units on the other side
 nai cataring policy ke draft ke mutabik sabarban stesan or duusare railway steshnon par khaanaa banane kaa kaam nahin kiya janaa chahie
 For this, emphasis is being given to the gradual abolition of the cooking above the platform in the cooking stalls and trolleys
 railway dhire-dhire sabhi platformon par bana banaaya khaanaa uplabdh karaane kii koshish karegaa
 The Ministry of Railways has advocated the promotion of automatic self-vending machines at railway stations in the next few years
 jiladhikariyon kaa maananaa he isse jahaan ek taraf railway steshnon par behtareen system ban jayega to vahiin duusari taraf gandagi se chhutkaaraa milegaa
 With this, the zonal railway has been denied that it will not issue any new license for any new Khomche, Dalia, Hand cart and Tea bucket
 in sabake bich railway cataring kii policy ke draft main railway steshnon par maujuud choti cataring unit ke liye sabhi arakshit shreniyon main 33 fisadi sab kota dene kaa faisla bhi kiya gaya he

 The domestic crisis of the Maldives would not have created such a stir in India if it had not opened the doors for the Chinese naval force to set its foot on this seething island south of the Indian peninsula
 maale main raashtrapati abdulla yamin kii satta ne 2012 main takhta palat ke jariye nashid ko avaidh tareeke se hataane ke baad bharat ke saath rajnatik, suraksha sambandhi or aarthik sampark lagaataar ghataae hai
 On the other hand, it has rapidly expanded its Chinese presence here
 isaki shuruyaat 2013 main maale airport ke liye bhartiya company jiemr ke theke ko radd karne se hui or jaldi hi vahaan kii sarkaar ne ek chini company ko yah theka de diya
 In July 2015 the property law of Maldives was changed to allow foreign ownership of land
 is shart par ki kam se kam ek arab dollar kaa nivesh ho or 70 fisadi jameen samudr se hasil kii gai ho
 China has a good experience of such island construction on the abandoned sea land in the South China Sea, so there was no need to speculate on who is going to benefit from this new law
 november 2017 main beijing kii yatra ke dauraan yamin ne china ke saath ek mukt vyapaar samjhaute par dastakhat kiye or bahut kam samay main ise apane yahaan manjuur bhi kara liya
 Now China and Saudi investors are developing the ambitious Ihavan project on the northern Ihavandhippolu island
 yah dweep bharat se bahut dur nahin he
 The project will have a modern port, an airport, a cruise hub, a marina and a dock
 aisi bhi khabaren hai ki china dakshini lamu pravaldweep main ek or bandargah kaa nirmaan kar saktaa he, jiskaa antim uddeshy use chini paryatakon ke liye ek ucch stareey resort main tabdeel karnaa he
 Now the largest share of foreign tourists coming to Maldives is from China
 china ne abhi 2011 main hi maale main apana duutavas shuru kiya he, ise dekhte hue uski yah pragati vaaki ullekhneey he
 China has consistently claimed that it had no intention of building a military base in the Maldives
 lekin agast 2017 main usne teen nausainik jahaaj pehali baar maale main hind mahaasaagar main utarkar apni yah manshaa saaf kar di ki is samudri ilaake main vah apni nausainya maujuudagi banaae rakhega
 He did not launch these ships in secret but in public
 isliye sandesh saaf or spasht haih china baar-baar dohraye jane vaale apane is daawey ko pukhta karne ke liye qamar kase hue he ki hind mahaasaagar koi bharat kaa mahaasaagar nahin he
 Yameen is happy to be the only medium through which the message reaches India
 thik usee tarah se jaise srilanka main rajpakshe ne pehle kiya tha, desh ke dakshini hisse me hambantota bandargah ke vikaas main china ke saamne apane desh ko bilkul girvee-sa rakhte hue
 It is argued that there is a business motive behind Chinese investment in Sri Lanka and the Maldives and one of the reasons is the recent ambitious belt road project
 lekin tathy yah he ki in vishaal pariyojnaon kii laagat donon deshon kii vittiya kshamta se pare he or isliye antat unke karj ke jaal main hi funs jane kaa andeshaa he
 This increases the risk that China will start making demands that fulfill its geopolitical intentions, as we have seen in Hambantota
 maldive ke to is tarah ke jaal main funsane ke zyada asaar hai
 It is worth noting here that Chinese naval tacticalists have made their intentions clear many times
 kuch saal pehle chini nausena kii ek patrika main china kii hind mahaasaagar ranneeti ko is tarah se samajhaayaa gaya thah ''sthanon kaa chunaav satarkta se karen, tainaati saavdhaanee se karen, sahakaari gatividhiyon ko praathamikta den, dhire-dhire ghusane kii koshish karen
 "chinese activities in the Indian Ocean are following exactly this
 duusari taraf samudri suraksha ke maamle main bharat kaa ravaiya bilkul iske vipareet he
 We must keep in mind the geopolitical picture before giving our response to the recent developments in Maldives and other strategically important countries
 maldive main jo kuch ho rahaa he, vah bharat ke liye mahatvapurn he—na sirf is lihaaj se ki yamin ne vahaan jo sahi or galat nirnay liye hai, balki isliye bhi ki unke satta main bane rahane kaa hamaare desh kii saamudrik ranneeti kii vishwasaneeyata par kya asar pad saktaa he
 Another way of looking at the recent developments in Maldives could be: assessing whether they at least provide an opportunity to prevent erosion if we cannot allow our impact to grow, especially in sensitive areas of security
 varsh 2012 main bharat ne ek galat nirnay liya
 We did not hear the then President Nasheed's call to intervene when he was being forced to resign, and after that it became easier for Yameen to seize power
 nashid sanvaidhanik tareeke se chune gaye rashtradhyaksh the or unke khilaaf takhtapalat ko rokane ke liye bhartiya hastkshep nyyochit tha
 There have been many occasions when swift action was needed to protect Indian interests despite the risks
 dekho or intjaar karo kii niti kai baar nirdayata se hamaare hiton ko nuksaan pahunchaati he
 Now the question arises that why is it important for China to establish its footing not only in Sri Lanka and Maldives but also in island countries like Seychelles and Mauritius? In the Chinese magazine that we have mentioned earlier, it was accepted that China may have to face the curbs of India or the activism of India by the spread of important sea routes between the Indian Ocean and the Western Pacific Ocean
 And in this he can get help from superpowers like America, Japan
 bhartiya prayadweep ke paas nausainik addon kii shrunkhlaa sthapit karnaa yaa kam se kam nausainik aapurti or godi suvidha kaa vikaas karnaa china ke liye kargar ranneeti ho sakati he
 So what can be a credible strategy for India in its tie? Such a strategy should be made by acknowledging the obvious truth that there is a huge economic and military difference between China and India
 is sambandh main do nitigat suzav ho sakate hai
 First, resources from less important areas should be diverted immediately to the periphery areas of this subcontinent so that from our point of view the entire situation could be compensated for
 vishaal bhugolic kshetra main bikhare hue sansaadhan kii jagah isamen taatkaalik padosiyon par nae sire se zyada jor dene kii baat hogi
 Secondly, increasing Chinese intimidation in the Indian Ocean is threatening not only Indian interests, but also the interests of stalwarts like America, Japan and Australia
 isse diego garsia main america bede par asar hoga or hind-prashanth kshetra main japani patibaddhta par bhi, jisamen ki australia kaa hit bhi judaa hua he
 All these countries are part of the newly formed quadrilateral, although they still have hesitations about it
 hind mahaasaagar main china ke ekatarfa dakhal ko rokane ke liye is chatushkon kii vishwasaneey bhoomika tay karne kii tatkaal jarurat he
 Due to Chinese activities in our immediate neighborhood, India's strategic place has been confined
 hamen iske amangal nihitarth ko samajhnaa hoga or sahi kadam uthaanaa hoga, iske pehle ki yahaan ke jamini halaat usee tarah se badal jaaen, jis tarah se dakshin china sagar main ho chukaa he
 In the long term, India will have to increase its economic and military capabilities more rapidly, so that the power gap with China can be reduced
 sirf isse hi hamaare paas uplabdh samrik vikalpon kaa vistaar ho saktaa he
 To increase these capabilities more priority will have to be given to increasing maritime capacity
 abhi to nausena ko kul raksha bajet kaa mahaj 17 fisadi hissaa mil paata he, lekin 2030 tak ise badhaakar 30 fisadi tak le janaa hoga
 It is indispensable to maintain our maritime edge in the Indian Ocean, with rapid erosion due to the expansion of the Chinese Navy

 khud dillihai courtne agenciyon ko ye aadesh die hai ki kanoonee daayaron ke antargat hi inhen hataaya jaae, lekin iske baavjood agenciyaan inhen ujaadne main lagi hai
 The big protest on 13 October: Congress has said that the Congress will stage a big protest on 13 October on the atrocities with street vendors
 ajay maakan ne bataaya ki 13 oktober ko congress dilli kii teenon emsidi ke sabhi 12 jonon par pradarshan karegi or rehadi patari waalon ke saath ho rahi karrwai kaa virodh karegi
 bjp's Dalit mps met Union Minister for Social Justice Thawarchand Gehlot over the Supreme Court's decision on the SC-ST Act

 gauratlab he ki 11 agast ko muslim sanghathan myanmar aurasamamen kathith taur par musalamaanon par hue hamale ke virodh main juluus nikaal rahe the, jo achaanak hinsak ho gaya tha
 Two people were killed in this incident, while more than 40 people were injured
 teen talaak ko jurm ghoshit karne or sajaa mukarrar karne sambandhi vidheyak guuruuvaar ko loksabhaa main kareeb chah ghante kii lambii bahes ke baad paarit ho gaya
 The bill is titled 'the Muslim Women Protection of Rights in Marriage Act'
 bina kisi sanshodhan ke paas is vidheyak ke tahat ab tripal talaak ko dandaneey aparaadh banaaya gaya he
 After passing in the Rajya Sabha and with the approval of the President, it will take the shape of the law
 aise main sabaki dilchaspee is baat main he ki iskaa asar kya hoga
 Now if someone gives triple divorce to Muslim women, what will be the options and what will change for them? kya badalegaa?teen talaak virdohi kanoon lagu hone ke baad agar koi pati apni patni ko ek samay main teen talaak detaa he, to patni kanoon kii sharan main jaakar nyaay kii ladaai lard sakegi
 This law will give statutory power to Muslim women
 teen talaak peedit mahila ko magistrate ke paas jane kii takat degaa
 This will enable the woman to fight a legal battle against the injustice done to her and get her rights
 is bill ke baad teen talaak dena ek jurm mana jayega
 Muslim women of the country will get the benefit of three anti-divorce laws
 2011 kii janaganana ke mutabik 8
 There are 4 crore Muslim women, who will get the benefit
 vidheyak main praavdhankisi vyakti dwaara apni patni ko ek saath ek samay main teen talaak chaahe bolkar, likhakar yaa mobile, computer ke jariye watsape, fasebuk, mail aadi ke rup main karata he to use gaiyrkanoonee mana jayega
 Three divorces together can be punished and fined from one year to three years
 iske liye patni ko court main ye sabit karnaa padegaa ki uske pati ne use ek samay main teen talaak die hai
 Alimony will be provided for the living of the wife and children of the three divorced victims
 patni naaballig bacchon kii abhiraksha kii bhi hakdaar hai
 Questions and objections on the bill - If the husband is in jail, who will pay for the wife and children - When the three divorces are illegal, why the punishment and how the case on the complaint of any third - The Shariat is against the three divorce bill
 On August 2017, the triple talaq was declared invalid
 iske baad mana ja rahaa tha ki teen talaak par roak lagegi, lekin aisa nahin ho sakaa he
 After the court's decision, about 100 cases have come up
 upi main sabase zyada maamle aae hai
 In the case of divorce in the Muslim community, only one man is divorced as compared to 4 divorced women
 2001 se 2011 kii bich muslim mahilaon ko talaak dene main 40 fisadi kii badhotaree hui he
 49 percent of Muslim girls get married between 14 and 29 years
 13
 5% of Muslim girls get married before 15 years
 ye mudde bhi uthenge abatin talaak vidheyak loksabhaa main paas hone ke baad ab rajyasabha se paarit hona he
 In such a situation, Muslim women who have played an important role in making the triple talaq illegal and enacted the law
 wo ab aage bahuvivaah or halaala ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaane ke mood main hai
 In the coming times, women can take to the road on these issues

 The political vacancy that has been continuing for the last seven months has come to an end as Jhalnath Khanal was sworn in as the new Prime Minister on Sunday in Nepal, but with it a new controversy was born
 yahaan tak ki shapathgrahan samaaroh khud kii party main asantosh, purv sahyogi dalon main naaraazgi tathaa satta bantwaare ko lekar vivaad kii bhent chadh gaya
 Khanal broke up with his ruling ally, the Nepali Congress, in an agreement with the opposition Maoists and thus became Nepal's 34th Prime Minister
 lekin ab vah apane nae sahyogiyon se mushkilon kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 This difficulty came to the fore directly when he took oath alone after the power-sharing talks with the Maoists failed
 raashtrapati ram baran yadav ne unhen pad evam gopneeyata kii shapath dilaai
 Although Khanal said that he would start working immediately with a small cabinet with competent ministers, he could not even announce his cabinet due to stiff opposition from the Maoists
 khanal kii party ke us prastaav ko maovadiyon ke pramukh pushp camel dahaal prachand ne khaarij kar diya, jisamen grih or vitt jaise pramukh mantralayon ko apane paas rakhane kii baat shaamil thi
 Prachanda abruptly withdrew his candidature in Thursday's election to ensure Khanal's victory
 sansad main sabase badi party hone or khanal ke 109 saansadon ke saath apane 237 saansadon ko jodne ke naate maovadi ab cabinet main anupatik pratinidhitiv kii maang kar rahe hai
 This demand simply means that 40 percent of the ministries will be with the Maoists
 maovadiyon ke saath kathin santulan sthapit karne ke saath hi khanal ne khud apni party main tathaa nepali congress ke saath sankat mol le liya he
 An embarrassing revelation on the occasion of the swearing-in revealed that Khanal had entered into a confidential deal with Prachanda to gain the support of the Maoists
 gopneey samjhaute main khanal ne maovadiyon kii pipuls libration army (piele) ko lekar, yaa piele evam sarkari suraksha balon kii samaan sankhya vaale ek nae suraksha bal kaa gathan karne hetu raji ho gaye hai
 He has also agreed to run the government with the system of taking over as Prime Minister in turn
 nepali congress or unki party ke asantushton ne in donon sharto kaa joardaar virodh kiya he
 Opponents say the agreement would be a violation of the 2006 peace agreement

 isliye ab ham ye bahes kar rahe hai
 i understand that now the umpires have the technology and equipment to watch their mistakes on TV
 isse unke paas apane pradarshan ko sudhaarney kii paryaapt sambhaavna he
 They can practice, re-think why they did, did they do? ”from time to time, such things keep coming up that good umpires are to be trusted for neutrality
 jab ashes test siries main simon tuffel or david shefrd jaise ucch koti ke apanyar nahin khadey hote hai to aise suzav aate hai ki shreshth ampiron ko hi mauka diya jaae chaahe unke desh kii timen hi kyon naa khel rahi hon
 Talking about the recent Edgbaston Test, a total of 20 decisions were reviewed
 ampire wilson ke liye ye khaas taur par kharaab pradarshan vaala test rahaa
 In such a situation, questions started again on the system of neutral umpires
 kya kehete hai riki ponting?austrailia ke purv captain riki ponting is maamle main kaaphi mukhar hai
 Ponting told Cricket Australia's website, "people can say that the technology we have now, it doesn't matter much
 lekin ye acha najaara nahin hota jab saaf taur par dikhne vaale galat faisle saamne aate hai
 The best umpires may appear outside all major tournaments
 ye unhen jaldi ritairement ke liye majaboor kar saktaa he
 "let me tell you that Mike Gatting himself got into a heated altercation with umpire Shakur Rana on a poor decision in Faisalabad Test in 1987 when he visited Pakistan
 ye vakya bahut surkhiyon main rahaa tha
 Gatting considers the benefit of having a neutral umpire to remember that sentence more heavily than a loss
 gaiting kehete hai, “hamaare paas kuch shandaar ampire hai
 Sadly, the last Test match was a very bad game for that man (umpire Wilson)
 yaa yun kahen ki donon (wilson or aleem daar) ke liye aisa rahaa
 The umpiring teaching is now quite high
 upkaran behatar ho rahe hai
 When you are in the middle, if you have played the game, you can understand the proximity of the bat pad even in the midst of a lot of noise
 yadi aapane game nahin khelaa, to kabhi-kabhi yah zyada mushkil hota he
 See, people make mistakes and people can get better
 upkaran unhen behatar banane ke liye maujuud hai
 i think we are on safe ground right now

 saal 2016 main kii gai sargical strike kii aguwai kar chuke leftinent general (sevanivrutt) di es hooda ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki modi sarkaar ne sena ko seemaa paar hamale karne kii anumati dene main bahut bada sankalp dikhaaya he, lekin sena ke haath usase pehle bhi bandhe hue nahin the
 DS Hooda was speaking at 'goa Fest', an annual event organized by advertising organizations here
 unhone kaha, "maujuuda sarkaar ne seemaa paar jaakar sargical strike or balakot main hawaii hamale kii anumati dene main nishchit rup se mahaan raajnneetik sankalp dikhaaya he
 But even before this, the hands of your army were not tied
 " unhone kaha, "sena ko khuli chhot dene ke bare main bahut zyada baaten hui hai, lekin 1947 se sena seemaa par swatantra he
 It has fought three to four wars
 "hooda ne kaha, "niyantran rekha ek khatarnaak jagah he kyonki jaisaa ki maine kaha ki aapke upar golibari kii ja rahi he or jameen par sainik iskaa turant jawaab denge
 They (soldiers) will not even ask me
 koi anumati lene kaa koi sawaal hi nahin he
 The army is given a free hand and all this has happened together, there is no alternative
 " hooda ne sitambar 2016 main uri aatanki hamale ke baad seemaa-paar sargical strike ke samay sena kii uttari kaman kii aguwai kii thi
 DS Hooda also condemned statements seeking evidence on military operations
 unhone kaha, ‘kripaya apane varisht sainya adhikariyon par bharosa rakhen
 When the Director General of Military Operations openly states that he carried out a surgical strike, there is obviously no reason to doubt it
 '' sevanivrutt leftinent general ne kaha ki sashastr balon ne kisi bhi sarkaar ke samay main kisi tarah kaa raajnneetik hastkshep nahin dekha he
 "as an intervener in military affairs, i can say with complete impartiality and honesty that political leaders have never interfered much in how to conduct military operations
" kisi ne nahin kaha ki hamen niyantran rekha par kis tarah kaa vyavhaar karnaa he or yahi aapako karnaa chahie
 Hooda led the Army's Northern Command during a cross-border surgical strike following the Uri terror attack in September 2016
 hooda ab rashtriya suraksha par congress ke kaarybal kaa netritv kar rahe hai
 Recalling the Uri terror attack, Hooda said, "that evening, i was with the Chief of Army Staff
 or ham tambuon kii raakh kii chaar inch moti parat se guzarate hue kah rahe the ki hamen kuch karnaa he, ham ise aise hi jane nahin de sakate
 "he said," When we were talking about options, it helped us that for the last one year we had been training for such a contingency situation
 ham nahin jaanate the ki yah mauka kab aayega
 "he said," (prior to the Uri attack), special forces were being prepared for this for the last one year
 
 
 yadi hamen seemaa paar pakistan main dhaava bolnaa ho, to hamen kya karnaa hoga
 Hooda said, "when we see soldiers going across the border and returning by targeting the terrorists, it means that they have only worked, worked and worked in their whole life
" sena main ham kehete hai ki shaantikaal main aap jitna pasinaa bahaaoge, yuddh ke dauraan aapkaa khun utana hi kam bahegaa
 "we decided to target five terrorist camps across the border," Hooda said
 yah behad pechida abhiyaan tha
 It is the highest chalk boundary in the world
 hamane iske paar jane kaa nirnay liya, jahaan par aatankwaadiyon ke shivi hai
 We decided to target them and come back
 '' unhone kaha ki sena behad ‘aatmavishvasi' thi kyonki surakshabalon ko behtareen prashikshan mila tha
 Hooda said, "and to be honest, i relied heavily on advice
 sheersh str par faisle lene ke liye aap akele hote hai or agar aap salaah lene se bachate hai to ho saktaa he ki aap galat faisle len
 "he said," We had to aim at different times
 ''hooda ne kaha, ‘‘ 27 sitambar kii raat main (sargical strike se do din pehle) hamen yah soochna mili ki inamen se ek aatanki shivi ko majboot banaakar sakriy kiya gaya
 We were wondering whether we should put it on the target list
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘ iske baad hamane chaar se paanch logon kii ek choti team bhejne or apane nishane par dhyaan kendrit rakhane kaa faisla kiya 
 We decided to take the risk because it was necessary
 ye vaise log the jinhone agle din hamen rasta dikhaaya
 "hooda said," We hit the first target at around midnight and on the last target we hit six o'clock in the morning
 in donon nishaanon ke bich chah ghante kaa antar tha
 Of course, after getting the first target, we were worried that the Pakistan Army might be active and think that other places could also be targeted
 ' While a students' demonstrations are being held on the C-SAT, there is a lot of uproar in the Parliament as well
 chaatr sangh lok seva ayog (UPSC) ke pariksha pattern (paathyakram or praaroop) main badlaav kii maang kar rahe hai
 Actually, the examinations conducted by UPSC for administrative services are taken in three stages
 pehle charan main praarambhik pariksha, duusare main mukhya pariksha jabaki ant main ummidavaaron kaa intervyuu liya jaataa he
 The first format of C-SAT had two papers as per the pre-c-sat format
 pehla bhaag opshanal hota tha jisamen chaatr apane pansad kaa vishay chunakar pariksha dete the jabaki duusare bhaag main general studies hota tha
 Totals were extracted using both
 isamen bhartiya bhashaaon ke chaatro ko phayda miltaa tha
 What is C-SAT? In fact, UPSC included C-SAT i
e
 Common Civil Services Aptitude Test in the preliminary examination in 2011
 ise shaamil karne se 400 ankon kaa general studies or 200 ankon kaa si-sat hota he
 Hindi medium students get caught in English Comprehension questions because the Hindi translation of these questions is quite complicated
 ise samajhane main kaaphi samay guzar jane ke kaaran hindi medium ke chaatr pichad jate hai
 Even after the implementation of C-SAT, there are only two papers but the first part is not optional
 ab isamen taaja ghatnakram, itihaas, bhugol, arthshaastra, vigyaan ke alaava kai anya vishyon ko bhi shaamil kar diya gaya he
 In other words, the first part is based on current affairs and reasoning
 jabaki duusare bhaag main angreji comprihension, sanchaar kaushal (conmunication skill), tarkit tark (logical rianning), vishleshnatmak kshamta (analitical ability), nirnay lene kii kshamta (disijan mekking or problem-solving), saamaanya maansik yogyata (general mental ability), angreji bhashaa samaj sahit kai vishyon ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 Students are opposing the English questions and aptitude test in Part-2
 bhartiya bhashi chaatr part-tu main funs jate hai
 Students also suffer the loss of negative marking if they misspell the answer
 donon paper anivaary hone ke kaaran angreji bhashaa ke chaatr aage nikal jate hai
 Till 1989, the medium of UPSC was English, but after the movement, other languages could also find a place in the examination of civil services
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki hindi or anya bhartiya bhashaaon ke chaatr badi sankhya main prashasnic sevaaon main aane lage
 After this, both English and Hindi question papers were made compulsory in the main examination from 2008
 isse hindi bhashi chaatro kii pareshaani bad gai
 The extent was reached when in 2011 started the process of adding English marks to merit in the C-SAT exam pattern
 upiessi ke aankadon ke mutabik, upiessi pariksha main angreji se safal hone vaale chaatro kii sankhya 2008 main 50
 57 percent which was 54 in 2009
 50, 2010 main 62
 82 in 23, 2011
 93 fisadi ho gai
 While there was a steady decline in the number of students taking the exam from Hindi language
 2008 main 5082 chaatro ne hindi bhashaa main civil seva pariksha di thi jo 2011 main ghatakar 1682 rah gayi
 In 2008, 117 students took the exam in Telugu language which reduced to 29 in 2011
 2008 main tamil bhashaa main 98 chaatro ne pariksha di thi jo 2011 main ghatakar 5 rah gayi
 According to the government and opposition trends, the Verma Committee constituted to review the C-SAT has considered the C-SAT scientifically correct
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki 24 agast kii taarikh ke hisaab se tamaam taiyaariyaan kii ja chuki hai
 Therefore, it is not possible to change the exam date
 iske evaj main asafal rahe chaatro ko ek or mauka diya ja saktaa he
 The government also announced that English marks will not be added to the merit of the pre exam
 haalanki ise lekar vipakshi dal ab bhi sarkaar ke khilaaf hamalavar hai
 Congress leader Rajiv Shukla said that until the government does justice, our opposition will continue
 vahiin sapa saansad naresh agarwal ne kaha ki desh kii rashtriya bhashaa kii upeksha ho rahi he
 At the same time JDU leader Sharad Yadav said that now it seems that the government should declare that it is not a country for Hindi speakers and Indian languages
 aam aadmi party ke netaa yogendra yadav ne kaha ki si-sat angreji ke bees number tak simit nahin he
 The basic problem is with the number eighty of the Coprevention, which the government has not paid attention to
 dramuk kii kanimojhi, trinmul ke derek o bryan, annadramuk ke ve maitrian or andhra pradesh se congress ke anek sadasyon ne maang kii ki civil seva ke prashn patr sabhi bhartiya bhashaaon main die jane chahie
 Students' students say that their demand is to completely remove the C-SAT from the exam, which the government has not fulfilled
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki sisat mainagement or technical students ke paksh main jhukaa he
 That is why we are opposing the removal of CSAT
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki jies (saamaanya adhyayan) main jahaan ek prashn ke 2 ank milte hai vahiin si-sat ke ek prashn kaa sahi uttar likhane par 2
 5 marks are given
 iske alaava si-sat prashnptr main comprihanshan se sambandhit sawaalon kii zyada hoti he jinke hindi anuwaad ko samajhane main khaasi samasya aati he
 On the other hand, this format proves beneficial for students related to science stream and engineering-management
 jaahir he jies or si-sat main moolyank kaa antar bhi angreji madhyam or science stream ke chaatro ke hi paksh main jaataa he

 Since 1981, Bhindranwale has been hiding in the circle of his armed colleagues near the Golden Temple, the holiest gurdwara of Sikhs in Amritsar
 dijies ne indira gandhi ko in vidrohiyon ko dabochne ke liye ek gupt mishan ke bare main bataaya, jo sainik hamale se kuch hi kam tha
 He said that Operation Sundown is actually a swoop
 helicopter main savaar commando swarna mandir ke paas guru nanak nivas guest house main utrenge or bhindranvaale ko uthaa lenge
 The operation was given this name because all the action was to take place after midnight
 oparation se pehle commando ne kiya abhyasaspecial group ke sadsy shraddhaluon or patrakaron ke vesh main swarna mandir main ghuskar aasapaas kaa sara nakshaa dekh aae the

 After capturing him, the ground squad used to enter there and blow it up
 ashanka thi ki bhindranvaale ke angrakshakon or bachaane aane vaale nagarikon ke saath golibari hogi
 Indira, who was the first to supersede Operation Sundown, listened silently and then asked only one question, "how much loss?" The DGS replied that 20 percent of the commandos and both helicopters
 uske is jawaab se gandhi khij gayi
 She wanted to know how many ordinary citizens would be killed
 ro ke adhikari ke paas is sawaal kaa koi jawaab nahin tha
 Indira refused and before the first helicopter took off, Operation Sundown was blocked

 After the dismissal of the state government in October 1983, thousands of paramilitary personnel dispatched from Delhi failed to stop the chaos in the state

 At that time, the 56th Commando Company of SG was the only squad in India that was made to fight in tight spaces

 The Haryana Government has put a stay on the decision of giving one-third of the amount of money received from Haryana players to the Haryana Sports Council till the next order
 mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ne shuukravaar ko ek twit ke jariye yah jaankaree di
 The state government was getting all-round criticism after the Haryana government's decision to share their income
 isi aalochana kii aanch main sarkaar ne turant prabhaav se is faisle par agali soochna tak ke liye roak laga di
 The Chief Minister wrote in the tweet, 'I have sought all the files and information in this regard from the Sports Department and the notification issued on April 30 has been put on hold until further orders
 hamen apane khilaadiyon ke athulaneey yogadan par garv he
 Earlier, in the information released by Ashok Khemka, Principal Secretary, Sports and Youth Welfare Department, the state government had asked all the players to give one-third of the prize money received from the professional function and the amount from the advertisements
 haryana sarkaar ke farmaan ke baad bhartiya khilaadiyon ne kii aalochanasarkaar dwaara jari 30 april kii is adhisuchana main kaha gaya he ki khilaadiyon se liya gaya yah ek-tihaai dhan haryana main khel or ubhartee pratibhaaon ke vikaas main istemaal kiya jayega
 Khemka signed this notification on April 27, stating that, 'players will contribute one-third of the money from their professional ceremonies and advertisements to the Haryana State Sports Council and this money for sports in the state and Will be used in the development of emerging talents
 'is kadam kii kai khilaadiyon ne aalochana kii he or saath hi unhone rajya sarkaar ko bhi fatkaar lagaai he
 However, Khemka defended the decision by Haryana Sports Minister Anil Vij before the government stayed the order
 vij ne kaha tha, 'is faisle main kuch nayaa nahin he
 This is the old rule of the government
 niyam 56 ke tahat, yadi koi sarkari karmchaaree vyavsaayik yaa vanijyik aay arjeet karata he, to use rajya sarkaar ke saath kamai kaa ek-tihaai hissaa jamaa karnaa hoga
 We allowed (international boxer) Vijender Singh to play professionally
 (punjab or haryana) ucch nyaayalay ne hamen is sambandh main niyam banane ke liye kaha
 We have now brought the rules
 'khemka ne kaha ki yah adhisuchana tab jari kii gai thi, jab rajya ne adaalat ko aashwaasan diya tha ki haryana sarkaar peshewar khel khilne vaale logon ke saath niti laaegi
 Generally, government employees are not allowed to play professional sports
 paisa keval khilaadiyon ke laabh ke liye upyog kiya jayega
 Khattar government's decree - Give 33% of the earnings from the advertisement to the state exchequer: Women's wrestling wrestler Geeta Phogat of India criticized the decision in a statement to a television channel, 'this new rule is making fun of the players
 cricket khilaadiyon ke liye to aisa koi niyam nahin he, jo anya khelon main hissaa lene vaale khilaadiyon se adhik kamaate hai
 Cricketers make a lot of money from advertisements, but boxing, kabaddi and wrestling players do not earn that much
 'gita ne sarkaar se sawalia lahaze main kaha tha, 'agar ham apni kamai kaa ek-tihaai hissaa de denge, to yah hamaare liye sahi nahin hoga
 What will be left for us in such a situation? ’in addition, wrestler Sushil Kumar has also raised his voice against this decision
 sarkari vibhaagon dwaara niojit khilaadiyon tathaa peshewar khel yaa vanijyik samarthan main hissaa lene waalon ko bhi ek-tihaai hissaa dena hoga
 i am writing this last part of the Xinjiang diary about a month after returning from China

 Because it is not directly related to India, it was also felt that people do not know or do not see
 lekin utyub par sava lakh se bhi zyada logon ne dekha or adhiktar ne saraahaa
 Some also asked some questions
 to shinjiyang diary kaa aakhri panna in sawaalon ke jawaab ke liye
 There was a question in them that i had gone to the invitation of China, then how can i be fair? But the truth is that it happens many times that a country or institution invites journalists here because it either wants to tell the world about itself or wants to give a clarification about itself
 china ke saath philhal yahi samasya he ki uske uighar muslimon ke saath vyavhaar ko lekar pashchimi deshon ke media main kaaphi sawaal uthe hai
 He is accused of repression and therefore China also wants to put his side
 isliye kai deshon ke patrakaron ko bulaakar wo apana paksh bhi rakh rahaa he
 Journalists who were with me included journalists from Japan, Albania, Turkey, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, South Korea, Czech Republic and Russia
 har patrkaar ne lagbhag ek jaisi hi chijen dekhin or ye patrakaron ke upar tha ki ve kis nazariye se dekhte
 Every journalist filed his own report
 in sawaalon se judin tippaniyan bhi meri documentry par ain ki maine yaa to china kaa paksh liya he, yaa uigharon ke saath aisa hi karnaa chahie tha
 But actually i have not favored anyone
 jo maine dekha vahi isamen bataaya he, na zyada na kam
 It is also understandable that you cannot go to Xinjiang without the permission of the Chinese government
 hamaare saath ke do videshi patrakaron ko oksu hawaondde par roka gaya, baavjood iske ki chini adhikari saath main the
 They too had to prove that the Chinese government had called them
 ye aatank ke ek vakt kaa after effect he
 Secondly, most Uighurs speak only Uigher language, very few speak Mandarin
 inase baat karne ke liye kai baar do dubhashiyon kii zarurat padi
 So in terms of language, we depended on them
 lekin ye bhi sach he ki hamane har prakaar kaa sawaal poocha or jawaab paaya, jaise aap documentry main dekh sakate hai
 We could not find any Uigher here without Chinese officials or Chinese interpreters
 jinase hamane baat kii unki baton ko swatantra rup se veriphy karne kaa koi tarika nahin tha, isliye bina tikaa-tippanee ke wo hi dikhaaya
 And he also told between the lines
 kal ko, china ke baahar agar koi uighar muslim pukhta saboot ke saath daman kii kahani bataae to wo bhi saamne rakhane main koi gurez nahin
 We also got stories related to it where some Uighur youth are saying that their friends also want to come to such vocational training center because this type of training from outside is very expensive
 kuch haan chiniyon kaa ye bhi kahana he ki unke bacchon ko aisi training muft kyon na mili? to ye bhi tasviir kaa ek rukh he
 This is also true in the terrorist attacks in Xinjiang and now rapid development is being done
 or yahi sab maine apni documentry main dikhaaya he
 Why should we always listen to the western media? Because there are many sides to the truth, i have put every side in front

 dilli bijepi pradesh adhykshamanoj tiwarinacoalingka taala todakar is muhim ko ek nayaa rang diya he
 Manoj Tiwari has claimed that he and his party are with Delhiites in this fight against sealing
 lekin kya khud unheen kii party is mudde par unke saath nazar aa rahi he?? jaaniye 'ajtak' kii is khaas report main
 
 
 The issue is with the court: Whenever Vijender Gupta, BJP MLA and Leader of Opposition Vijendra Gupta is talked about the issue of sealing, he seems to be questioning the role of Chief Minister Kejriwal and his road notifying
 netaa ji ke paas ceiling ke mudde par bolne ke liye khub gyaan bhi he, lekin jab unase unheen ke pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari ke taala todane kii baat par sawaal poocha to unhone kaha ki ye masalaa court ke paas he
 Tiwari did not do anything wrong: Udit Raj is aware that Vijendra Gupta Kimanoj Tiwari has no support opinion about this lock-breaking campaign but BJP MP from West Delhi Udit Raj is seen supporting his state president
 udit raaj kehete hai ki ham dilli aabaad kar rahe hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party has spread anarchy in Delhi
 udit raaj ne kaha ki ceiling supreme court kii cameti karvaa rahi he, tiwari ne kuch galat nahin kiya he

 bijepi saansad apane pradesh adhyaksh ke bare main kehete hai ki janata ke pratinidhi hone ke naate unhone thik hi kiya he

 When the question comes on the role of the BJP state president to break the lock, MLA OP Sharma calls that action wrong and says that i do not support breaking the lock
 jaahir he taala todane ke is kaam main bijepi ke saare netaa pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari ke saath ekajute nazar nahin aa rahe hai, to vahiin duusari taraf udit raaj-pravesh verma jaise saansad hai jo apane adhyaksh kaa samarthan kar rahe hai

 The reason for the provocation for the reprimand is the revelation of what he allegedly said was a strategy to disrupt Parliament in the Congress meeting held on 21 July
 pichley saal narendra modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke baad kai avasaron par unki tarif kar shashi tharur musiibat mol le chuke hai
 He has been criticized within the party for this

 Recently also praised Modi's campaign on Yoga
 unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki pradhanmantri jis desh kaa bhi daura karte hai, vahaan sakaaratmak prabhaav chhodte hai, bhale hi ve upie kii nitiyon kaa hi paalan karte hon
 Tharoor alleged that those who spoke to the media after the July 21 meeting want to trouble them
 tharur ne kaha ki iske peeche agenda ho saktaa he

 Asked about the letter, Tharoor said, "I will neither confirm nor deny it, because answering such questions gives legitimacy to your questions
" ' yah poochne par ki kya vah party se naakhush hai, to kerala se saansad ne kaha, 'main kahana chaahunga ki apni bhoomika se main puri tarah santusht hum or congress party ke andar kaam kar rahaa hum
 In the letter, Tharoor expressed suspicion of the agenda behind the revelation and cited various reports, particularly reports from Malayalam media that Sonia reprimanded him for his allegations

 Dengue has broken all records here in the last one month
 takreeban 500 sandigdhd maamalon ne jila prashasan kii chintaa badha di he
 It is believed that dangerous larvae are thriving with water filled around constructions sites
 sitambar kaa maheenaa abhi shuru hi hua he kisibarcity main dengue ne doharaa shatak laga diya
 The surprising thing is that these figures are when the district administration is resorting to hi-tech techniques for prevention of dengue
 haalanki ye pehla mauka nahin he jab dengue ke aankadon ne jila prashasan kii neend udayi ho
 Dengue havoc is seen every year in Gurgaon city called Hitech, but the preparations of the District Health Department seem to fail every year
 lagaataar bad rahi marijon kii sankhya bhi vibhaag ke liye chunauti banati ja rahi he
 Why are these officials working to get the cyber city free from dengue, they may not be working with the hi-tech bridging system, but the result is far from expected

 Former board secretary Jaywant Lele has opposed 15 percent stake in a sports company by Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 lele ke mutabik, dhoni ne board ko pehle bataanaa chahie tha
 He also accused Dhoni of influencing the selectors
 jayavant lele ne dhoni kii sport company ke bare main kaha ki yah cricket ke liye acha he yaa nahin, vah charchaa kaa vishay he, magar isamen sidhe-sidhe kancelict of interest to he hi he
 Dhoni is the captain of the Indian team in all three formats
 aise main unki sport company dwaara suresh raina, rabindra jadeja, aar pi singh or pragyan ojha ko team main shaamil karne ke liye bhi dabaav bhi banaaya gaya ho saktaa he
 The biggest thing is that as captain, is it not Dhoni's moral duty to inform the board? Lele said, "I think it should have been conveyed by Dhoni to the board and it becomes his moral responsibility
 abhi chaar khilaadi to inaki hi form ke saath jude hai to chayankartaaon par bhi nishchit taur par unako shaamil karne kaa dabaav dhoni ne banaaya hoga
 ' phiraki ke jaadugar or bharat ke purv captain anil kumble ne rashtriya cricket academy ke adhyaksh pad se istipha dekar sabhi ko chaunkaa diya
 Two months ago a dispute arose over his post of conflict of interest
 kumble kaa istipha bisisiai kii kaarysmiti ne sweekaar bhi kar liya he
 Punjab Cricket Association general secretary MP Pandove has been appointed acting president of NCA
 kumble ne istife kaa aadhikarik kaaran ‘samay kaa abhaav’ bataaya he chunki vah karnataka rajya cricket sangh ke adhyaksh, ipel kii royal chalangers bangalore ke menter hone ke saath apni company ‘tenvik’ bhi dekhte hai
 The company is managed by Karnataka players r Vinay and s Aravind
 kuch maheene pehle aisi khabaren thi ki keessie adhyaksh pad par rahane ke kaaran kumble ke ‘hiton kaa takaraav’ ho rahaa hai kyonki vah ek aisi company ke maalik hai jo karnataka ke sheersh khilaadiyon kaa prabandhan dekhati he
 Some top board officials said that Kumble had differences with top BCCI officials regarding NCA functioning as NCA has now become a rehabilitation center for injured Indian players
 unhone kaha, ‘bisisiai ke aalaa adhikariyon kaa maananaa he ki junior str par koching kaa vikendrikaran hona chaiye
 This could have undermined the NCA status as this is what makes junior players polished

 Chidambaram also stressed that the real problem is not peace or development, but winning the hearts of the villagers

 Arun Kumar Singh, US President Donald Trump's joining with the Prime Minister of India on September 22 at a 50,000 indian-americans rally in Houston, USA was unprecedented and perhaps 'historic'
 iske america-bharat dotarafa rishton ke liye sambhavit phaayde hai
 But it also raises many questions
 yah asamaanya he ki america raashtrapati apane desh kii yatra par aae videshi netaa ke saath aisi kisi saarvajanik aayojan main shaamil hon
 In an event that deals not with any aspect of American, or shared, history, but with the immigrant community
 trump ke saath to aisa or bhi he, jinhen kisi or ke saath dhyaan baantnaa nagavar gujarata he
 He sat for an hour in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech, that too when Modi spoke broadly on the domestic achievements he had achieved after 2014
 jaahir he, trump ko isamen kuch phaayde najar aae honge
 In 2016, nearly 80 percent of indian-americans voted for Hillary Clinton
 america ke zyaadaatar nae apravasi samudaayon kii tarah hi bhartiya-america samudaay ke zyaadaatar log democratic party kaa samarthan karte hai, kyonki sthaneey samudaayon ke saath khud ko rachaane-basaane ke liye unhen vividhta or bahulata ke phalne-phoolne kii jarurat he
 The only exception is the rich sections, who keep trying to take advantage of the reduction in taxes and relaxation in rules and regulations
 trump seemaant nirvachan kshetron main swing voton ko apane paale main laana or apane 2020 ke chunaav abhiyaan ke liye chanda hasil karnaa bhi chahenge
 The indian-american community is now the largest middle-income ethnic group in America and also the most educated
 2016 ke chunaav abhiyaan main bhi ek tabake ne unke liye prachaar kiya or dhan ugaha tha, jabaki zyaadaatar apravasi samoohon ne unase duuri bana rakhi thi
 Trump remains a dividing figure in American politics
 unke khilaaf mahabhiyog kii maang lagaataar uthati rahi
 He was bolstered by the news that he had pressured the President of Ukraine to launch an investigation against his potential Democratic rival and former Vice President Joe Biden
 yues congress ke paanch main chaar bhartiya-americanyon ne, saath hi akeli hindu-america pratinidhi tulsi gaboard ne bhi, khud ko huston kii raily se dur rakhaa
 By the way, Democratic Majority Leader Stenny Hoyer was present there
 hoyar ne apane sambodhan main vividhta, bahulata or sahishnutaa par jor diya
 But the presence of a large number of Democratic leaders would have stamped the bipartisan support in favor of relations with India in the US Congress
 bharat or pakistan, donon deshon ke pradhanmantri ke saath apni baithkon main trump ne aatankwaad ke masale par pakistan par dabaav banane se inkaar kar diya
 This shows his bargaining point of view as he needs Pakistan in the context of Afghanistan
 vaise bhartiya-america samudaay or america-bharat rishton ke liye trump kii maujuudagi phydemand rahi
 He highlighted the community's contribution to healthcare, technology and enriching American values
 yah vah raashtrapati kah rahaa tha jisane apravasi virdohi bhaawanaaon ko hawa di, ech1bi vija kii prakriya ko sakht banaaya or ech4 vija dharakon kii patniyon ke kaam karne par pabandi laga di
 This may reduce the restlessness of the community
 modi or trump haal main kai baar mili hai—osaka (june, ji-20 shikhar sammelan main), biaritj (agast, ji-7) or neuyork (sitambar, sanyukt raashtra mahasabha) main
 The thoughtful interaction between the two leaders will signal to the bureaucrats of both the countries that there is a favorable air for the relationship
 isse raksha sahyog, technology main ucch str par milakar kaam karne, vyapaarik takaraavon ko sulajhane or kshetreey tathaa vaishvik ranneetiyon main talmail bithaane ko lekar faislon main teji aani chahie
 The indo-pacific is the platform of interest of both where they are facing the economic, technological and military power of China
 china, america ke dabadabe ko khatm karne par tula he, dakshin china sagar main sanchaalan ke niyam tay kar rahaa, karj ke rup main paisa laga dakshin or dakshinpurv asia main vikalpon ko prabhavit kar rahaa he
 He is spreading military claws through ports and facilities in Qianmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Djibouti
 iske jawaab main dwipaksheeya ke alaava, japan se tripaksheeya rishton ko pragadh karnaa or australia ko bhi jodate hue chaturbhujiya rishte ko videsh mantri ke str tak upar le janaa shaamil he
 Greater sensitivity is expected in cases with contraindications
 rus par lagaae gaye america pratibandhon ko bharat sweekaar nahin karata or apane rashtriya suraksha hit main kharid karte vakt chhot kii ummid karegaa
 Reducing tension between us-iran in West Asia will have a good effect on India's energy security and connectivity interests
 taliban ke saath sena kii vaapasi ke samjhaute kii bajaae afghanistan kii sarkaar ke liye america kaa zyada dotuk samarthan or shanti kii eemaandaar koshish ko bharat main achche dhang se liya jayega
 Even after the change of several governments in India and America since the year 2000, the relationship between the two countries has steadily strengthened
 huston main trump kii maujuudagi sanket he ki ve ise aage badhaane ke liye taiyaar hai
 In the process, they also want to gain some political advantages for themselves

 The news agency AFP has given this information
 samachar agency ffp ke anusaar, america raashtrapati donald trump ne ovel offis main samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki 'yah donon deshon ke bich bahut khatarnaak sthiti he
 He also said that there are many problems between India and Pakistan at the moment
 bataa den ki 14 farvari ko pulavama aatanki hamale main 40 jawan shahid ho gaye the or is aatanki hamale kii jimmedaari aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ne lee thi
 Indeed, after the Pulwama terror attack, India is trying to isolate Pakistan globally
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki kashmir ghati main suraksha balon is sadi kaa ab taka sabase bada aatanki hamalaa he
 After the Pulwama terror attack, India has also stripped the status of "most Favored Nation" given to Pakistan and imposed 200 percent customs duty on Pakistan's goods
 bharat ne kaha he ki uske paas pulavama hamale main pakistan ke shaamil hone ke pukhta sakshya hai or is hamale main puri tarah se pakistan or iesai kaa haath he
 However, the Pakistan government has denied involvement in the attack, citing it as a "matter of grave concern"
 darasal, guuruuvaar yani 14 farvari ko siarpief kaa kafila jammu se srinagar ja rahaa tha
 The convoy had about 78 vehicles and 2500 personnel
 usee dauraan bain ore se overtek kar visphotak se ladi ek car ai or usne siarpief kii bas main takkar maar di

 It was done at 30
 colors ne apane slot ko prime time main badalane kaa faisla kiya taaki sho indian televijan par bana rahe, lekin aisa lagata he sho ko iskaa phayda nahin mila

 # strong # powerful # powerfulwomen # selflove # openbook # blackandwhitea post shared byjuhi Parmar (@ juhiparmar14) onmar 6, 2019 at 4:36 am PST What is the story of the show? The story of the show is of the Khanna family
 khanna parivaar apane sapanom ke ghar main kadam rakhata he, lekin wo sabhi sach se anjaan hote hai
 Initially everything is fine but over time they are faced with terrible events
 parivaar is baat se anjaan he ki ghar main kuch buraai he or ve kaale jaadu ke prabhaav main hai
 The show featured black magic, mystery and the supernatural element in a thrilling way
 baadh kaa kahar barapaane ke liye badnaam kosi nadi bhale hi is saal ab tak zyada kahar na dha pai ho, magar nepal main agle saptaah hone vaali joardaar barish ke mausam vibhaag ke purvanumaan ne bihar ke logon kii jaan saansat main daal di he
 People here have been scared due to 'mourning of Bihar'
 padosi desh nepal kii dharti par padin barish kii chaar boonden bhi yahaan ke logon ko sihara detii hai, kyonki kosi kii dhara main parivartan or tatbandh tuutane kii afvaah bhi yahaan ke logon ko apane ghar chhodkar bhaagane ko vivash kar detii he
 The fear of Kosi is overshadowed by the hearts and minds of the people here
 ise kuch log kosi kaa coup maanate hai to kuch log sarkaar kii doshapurn ranneeti kaa nateeja
 The government has been announcing relief and rehabilitation after floods in these areas every year, but even today people are waiting to get the benefits of those relief and rehabilitation schemes in the right way
 varsh 2008 main 18 agast kii raat ke manjar ko yahaan ke log ab bhi nahin bhul sake hai
 The wound that Kosi caused by breaking the embankments of Kusha in many districts of the state, has not been applied to that wound
 jaahir he, ghaav ab bhi hare hai
 It is a matter of fact that after much effort, the raging currents of Kosi have been tied again at the same places
 supaul jile ke nirmali vidhansabha kshetra ke vidhayak aniruddh prasad yadav kehete hai ki yahaan ke log barish hote hi dehshat main aa jate hai, magar prakritik aapadaa par kiskaa vash chalata he
 Yadav said that rumor-mongering elements also become active in the rainy season in areas adjacent to Nepal
 vidhayak ne bataaya ki prashasan in ilaakon main baadh se nipatane kii puri taiyaari kar chukaa he
 People keep praying to God that Kosi's catastrophic stream did not come towards their village
 log maan chuke hai ki kosi kii dhara ko rokna sarkaar yaa kisi maanav ke vash kii baat nahin he
 Only God can stop it
 supaul nivasee shivanandan saah ne bataaya ki is saal monsooni barish ke baad kosi, jile ke sadar prakhand ke balava gaanv ke astitv ko mitaane par amada he
 400 houses belonging to about 300 families have been badly damaged in Kosi's Tandava
 hajaaron hectare main lagi lahalhati fasal ko kosi ne barbaad kar diya he
 People are leaving the village to escape to save their lives
 ek anya gramin kii maane to kosi ke kataav ke kaaran do-teen gaanv to kosi ke garbh main samaa bhi chuke hai
 Now the problem of permanent displacement has come to the residents here
 ve kehete hai ki baadh se nibatane ke liye prashasan ne daawey to avashya kiye hai, lekin jab sthiti kharaab hoti he to unke daavon kii kalai khul jaati he
 They say that half the trouble can be overcome if the administration keeps the arrangement of boats
 in ilaakon main aise log bhi hai ki jinke kheton main aaj bhi teen varsh se baaluu (ret) bhari he
 People of Virpur said that there is still a pile of sand in their fields
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne peediton ke liye kuch raahat saamagree to avashya bheji he, magar baaluu ke dheron ke kaaran unhen apana bhavishya 'ret kii diwaar' lagane laga he
 Even though five years have passed since the Kosi tragedy, the 'wounds' of the people here have become so deep that no 'ointment' is proving effective on them
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ko ham bhartiya raajnneeti ke ek aise netaa ke taur par jaanate hai jo sirf raajnneetik jagat main hi nahin film jagat main bhi samaan rup se charchit hai

 piem narendra modi:omang kumaar ke nirdesan main bani vivek oberoi starer ye film piem modi par bana sabase charchit or vivaadit project tha

 The film faced all kinds of allegations and despite getting a clean chit from the censor board, it was stopped just a day before its release
 loksabhaa chunaav khatm hone tak film par bain lagane vaale chunaav ayog ne tark diya ki ye film piem modi kaa gungan karti he
 Modi- Journey of a Common Man: This web series on the life story of PM Narendra Modi was also the subject of controversies
 umesh shukla ke nirdesan main bani is web siries ko bhi chunaav ayog ne bain kar diya tha
 The same reasoning was made behind banning this web series that it could benefit the ruling party
 kul 10 episod vaali is web siries main faijal khan, ashish sharma, mahesh thakur or praachi shah ne ahm kirdaar nibhaae the
 Documentary films: All kinds of documentary films have also been made on PM Modi
 gujarat dangon ke dauraan modi gujarat ke mukhyamantri the
 a lot of charges were leveled against him, but with time, Modi overtook those things on the strength of his work
 us vakt bhi modi par tamaam documentry filmein bani thim or unke pradhanmantri banane ke baad bhi un par documentry filmein banaai gayi
 The difference was that it had turned negative from positive
 bhojpuri film:actor or bhartiya janata party ke gorakhpur se saansad ravi kishan do baar modi par film banaae jane ko lekar bayaan de chuke hai
 Ravi Kishan says that he wants to make a film in Bhojpuri on PM Narendra Modi
 haal hi main unhone ek bayaan main dete hue kaha tha ki yadi wo film banaaenge to usamen naach gaanaa nahin hoga
 He will make a film based entirely on real facts

 While the number of children who died of Japanese encephalitis in 2005 was 1,101, in 2011 it was 165 and so far this year 141 patients have been victimized by Japanese encephalitis
 jei kaa prakope bhale kam ho gaya par duusari tarah ke virus kaa khatra bad gaya he
 Since 2007, every year the number of children dying of encephalitis is crossing the figure of 500 and more than 3,000 children are suffering

 "there is no vaccine to prevent the entry of anti-virus causing brain inflammation by entering the body through contaminated drinking water
 keval swatchta se ise failane se roka ja saktaa he, lekin is ore koi bhi prayaas nahin ho rahe hai
 Father Sobin, deputy director of the NGO Purvanchal Rural Services Committee, says that most of the patients suffering from encephalitis are coming from rural areas
 yahaan par bhugarbha jal kii upree parat pradooshit he
 "boring of hand pumps in villages is as deep as 80 feet, which should be increased to at least 120 to 150 feet," he says
 yah beemaari rokane main kargar ho saktaa he

 Unfortunately, the pediatric department of the BRD Medical College, which was also infested with brain fever patients, is also facing a shortage of doctors

 Efforts are underway for a new deployment
 kushvaha kehete hai, ''medical college ke bal rog vibhaag main diploma kii siten varsh 2013 main 10 se badhkar 20 ho jaaengi
 This will overcome the shortage of doctors to a great extent
 ”inseflitis se peedit 10 jilon main se gorakhpur ko chhodkar anya kisi jile main abhi tak ventilator yukt isiu nahin he
 Half of the total 53 community health centers — CHC — present in these districts have no child doctors

 Despite being the only psychiatric center among 10 affected districts of Purvanchal, a maximum of 15 to 20 patients arrive here everyday
 uttar pradesh sarkaar ke swasthya mantri ahamed hasan kehete hai, ''hamaari sarkaar dimagi bukhaar se peedit jilon ke aspataalon main ventilator yukt isiu muhaiyaa karaane kii disha main prayaas kar rahi he
 It will have at least 100 ventilators
 jin aspataalon main chikitsakon kii kami he, use puraa kiya ja rahaa he
 The Chief Secretary of the state is constantly monitoring the prevention of this disease
 hamaari sarkaar dimagi bukhaar se ho rahi mauton ko har haal main rokegi
 "chief Secretary Javed Usmani has asked the district magistrates and health workers of the encephalitis affected districts to make such arrangements that there should be no death next year
" unhone unki jimmedaariyon ko spasht kar diya he or yah bhi jataa diya he ki is beemaari se maut ke maamalon main adhikariyon ko jimmedaar mana jayega
 Government officials and employees can save the lives of innocent people by taking preventive measures, if the government wakes up from the problems of the victimized children and their parents

 haalanki khushi bhi he ki meri us vakt sooyeeboojh 30 se zyada yatrion kii jaan batch gayi
 On September 30, veteran leader of Congress and former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Digvijay Singh is going to start the religious journey
 ve apni narmada yatra ke dauraan kareeb 3500 kilometre paidal chalenge or is duuri ko wo 6 maheene main puraa karenge
 He is going to start this journey from the Joteshwar Ashram in Narsinghpur of his Guru Swami Swaroopananda
 yatra ke dauraan 6 maheene rahenge siyasat se duuradigvijay apni is yatra ke dauraan 6 maheene siyasat se dur rahenge
 The special thing is that during his visit there will be no Congress flag and no leader will be invited
 haa, agar koi kaaryakarta yatra main saath chalanaa chaahe to chal saktaa he
 But he also has to follow non-political discipline
 is yatra ke chalate hi digvijay ne bataur congress prabharee mahasachiv goa, telugana or karnataka kaa prabhaar chhodane kaa alaakaman se anurodh kiya tha, jisko maan liya gaya
 Significantly, Diggi is now the Congress general secretary, but he only has the charge of Andhra Pradesh, where the Congress is not visible at present after the bifurcation of the state
 maa narmada kii parikrama ke dauraan saath hongi sirf patnidilachasp baat yah he ki, is vyaktigat dharmik yatra ke dauraan digvijay kaa aadhikarik taur par saath unki patni amrutha singh dengeen
 In this yatra, Digvijay and his wife will cook and eat only after meeting
 tay he ki, yatra ke dauraan naa to wo kisi ke ghar jaakar bhojan karenge or naa hi kisi ke ghar se banakar aayaa bhojan grahan karenge
 All this is because, Digvijay wants to keep this journey completely spiritual
 chhavi ke ulat khaasaa puja paath karte rahe hai diggi rajyapane bayanon ke chalate digvijay bijepi ke hameshaa nishane par rahete hai, unako moulana digvijay kaa tamgaa bhi virdohi dete rahe hai
 But in real life, Digvijay recites a lot of pooja
 digvijay har saal 24 kilometre kii govardhan parvat kii parikrama bhi nange pair karte aaye hai
 Also, it is in their tradition to worship Goddess Pooja and Siddha Peetha in the Navdurga
 har saal maharashtra ke pangarpur jaakar puja paath kii tasviren aati raheen hai
 Therefore, Digvijay does not consider this new journey a new thing
 bas itnaa kehete hai ki, mere man main bahut dinon se aata tha ki, main maa narmada kii parikrama karun to maine tay kar liya
 i will also do it with the blessings of mother Narmada
 rose chalenge 20 kilometre, sehat ko lekar sajag 70 ke diggiumr ke 70 padaav paar kar chuke diggi raja ke liye narmada kii dagar aasaan nahin rahane vaali, ye wo jaanate hai
 This 3500 km walk has to be completed in 180 days with his wife i
e
 10-10 km walk daily in the evening
 is lihaaj se digvijay ne patni ke saath taiyaari bhi shuru kar di he
 Well, getting up early in the morning and doing yoga and then doing home exercise has been a part of Diggi Raja's routine for years
 logon se apni kothi ke lon main tej chalate chalate milanaa or baat karnaa bhi swasthya ke prati diggi kii sajagata ko dikhaata he
 For health, Diggi always use lukewarm water for drinking and bathing, and not using cold water at all
 is baat ko maanate hue diggi chutile andaaz main kehete hai ki, netaa or gavaiya ko galaa thik rakhana padataa he, isliye hameshaa gunaguna pani istemaal karata hum
 Due to the journey, along with his wife, Diggi Narmada of the 70's walking 70-20 km walk in Lodi Garden, understand the difficulty
 isliye apni puraani dincharya main unhone rose 15-20 kilometre ek baar main paidal chalanaa bhi jod diya he
 The yatra is scheduled to begin from September 30, but Digvijay has already started walking 15-20 kilometers daily in the Lodi Gardens near his Lodi Road home to pass that exam
 diggi ne kaha- yatra dharmik-aadhyatmik, virdohi bole- sirf rajnatikwaise ye to hui diggi raja kii narmada yatra kii wo kahani, jo diggi raja bataa rahe hai
 But if we talk about critics and leaders, they clearly say that this journey of Digvijay will pass through about 140 assembly constituencies, of which 114 assembly constituencies will come from Madhya Pradesh and 26 assembly constituencies of Gujarat
 aise main zindagi bhar khalis raajnneeti ke khilaadi rahe bhale hi kehete rahen ki, unki yatra rajnatik nahin, lekin saal 2017 ke aakhir main gujarat ke chunaav or phir 2018 main madhya pradesh ke chunaav ke vaqt tay kii gai yatra kii timming bataati he ki, ho naa ho maqasad to siyaasi hi he

 Clarke said in a conversation with Press Trust, "any relationship requires openness and honesty
 cricket main bhi aisa hi he jisamen ek captain or ek coach hota he
 You have to be honest
 unhone kaha ki matbhed hona laazmi he lekin unhen kamare ke bheetar suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 In any good relationship, the challenges are also big
 australia ke purv captain ne kaha ki kumble or kohli ke maamle main unka kuch kahana galat hoga kyonki vah dressing room kaa hissaa nahin hai
 Clarke said that i know Anil Kumble who is a great person
 coach kaa kaam dressing room main maujuud captain kii madad karnaa he
 i don't know what the issue is because I'm not part of the dressing room
 vishwacap vijeta captain ne haalanki kaha ki cricket timen captain chalaate hai

 He said that there is no single style of parenting of children
 har kisi kii apni style hoti he kyonki har baccha samaan nahin hota
 It is the same in cricket
 clark kii captaini kii style juda thi lekin vah viraat ke junun or aakraamakata ke kaayal hai
 He said, 'virat is a great captain
 vah kaaphi pratispardhi he or usee tarah se captaini karata he

 They said that differences are inevitable but they can be resolved within the room
 kisi bhi achche rishte main chunautiyaan bhi badi hoti he
 The former Australian captain said he would be wrong to say something in the case of Kumble and Kohli as he is not part of the dressing room
 clark ne kaha ki main anil kumble ko jaanata hum jo behtareen insaan he
 The coach's job is to help the captain in the dressing room
