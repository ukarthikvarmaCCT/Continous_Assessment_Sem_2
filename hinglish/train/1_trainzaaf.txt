 The Bihar results reminded Delhi
 bijepi ko bhi or desh ko bhi

 1
 DNA jumla: Modi raised questions on Nitish's DNA (political according to Modi)
 lekin nitish kumaar ise bihar kii janata kii asmita se jodne main kaamyaab rahe
 The same thing happened in Delhi

 bihar ko bimaaru batanagaya raily main modi ne bihar ko bimaaru rajya kaa darja de diya tha
 However, the figures are just the opposite
 bihar ab bimaaru ke daayre se baahar nikal chukaa he
 Nitish also managed to prove this as an insult to the people of Bihar
 3
 Jangraj's fear: Modi promoted Nitish Kumar's alliance with Lalu Prasad as Jungle Raj Part-2
 lekin lalu ne kamandal kii yaad dilaa di
 Gradually bjp's rallies started focusing on more negative publicity than development issues
 4
 Polarization on Beef: There was a continuous rhetoric from bejp leaders during the entire election
 bijepi ko isse dhruvikaran kii ummid thi, lekin nahin hua
 Even Amit Shah's hateful words towards Pakistan did not work
 5
 Reservation issue: BJP also suffered loss due to statement made against Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat's reservation
 bhagwat ne aarakshan niti par punarvichaar karne ko kaha tha
 Lalu challenged it to show that if any Mai had the power in Lal, she finished it

 bharat ne cancil kii RCEP kii deelbharat ko nahin tha kai masalon par bharosabazar main bad saktaa tha china kaa vyaparbharat ne 16 deshon ke RCEP vyapaar samjhaute kaa hissaa nahin banane kaa faisla liya he
 While the ruling party is praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision, the Opposition is also calling it his victory
 haalanki, piem modi ne is samjhaute main shaamil na hone ke peeche bharat ke hiton ko bataaya he
 PM Modi has said, 'the current form of the RCEP agreement does not fully reflect the basic spirit and accepted guiding principles
 yah maujuuda paristhiti main bharat ke dirghakaalik muddon or chintaaon kaa santoshjanak rup se samaadhaan bhi pesh nahin karata he
 In such a situation, questions are also arising as to what harm India was going to suffer by joining the RCEP agreement
 in kaarnon se baahar bharat ne khinche haathbataya ja rahaa he ki RCEP par charchaa main kai masalon par bharat ko bharosa nahin mil paaya
 These include inadequate protection from increased imports, a $ 105 billion trade deficit with RCEP member states, lack of confidence in market access, disagreement on non-tariff restrictions and potential violations of regulations
 china isamen sabase badi vajah he
 - Actually, the biggest reason for getting out of this agreement is being said to be imports from China
 agar bharat RCEP samjhauta karata to bhartiya bazaar main saste chinis saamaan kii baadh aa jaati
 In addition to 10 ASEAN countries in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, RCEP includes 6 other countries Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea
 samjhauta karne vaale deshon ke bich mukt vyapaar ko badhaava miltaa he
 So, by joining the agreement of India, China would have got a good opportunity to step into the Indian market
 -RCEP main shaamil deshon ke saath bharat kaa niryaat se zyada aayaat hota he
 There is no system under the agreement that can be controlled if imports increase
 yani china yaa kisi duusare desh ke saamaan ko bhartiya bazaar main paryaapt anupaat main anumati dene par sthiti spasht nahin thi
 - The countries involved in this agreement will have to give each other all economic exemptions including tax cuts in trade
 lekin samjhaute main non-tarriff pratibandhon ko lekar koi bharosemand vaada shaamil nahin he
 India's trade with the countries included in the RCEP has also not been beneficial
 pichley ek saal kaa vittiya ghaataa 105 billian dollar kaa rahaa he
 That is, this agreement was not suitable for India also
 in tamaam vajahon se hi bharat main RCEP kaa virodh kiya ja rahaa tha
 From opposition Congress to trade unions were also opposing this, after which Modi government itself pulled out of RCEP citing internal interests
 kolkata kii tipu sultan masjid ke shahi imam moulana nurur rahamaan barkati kaa badbolapan jari he

 ye shikaayatein laal batti ke avaidh istemaal or bhadakaau bhaashan dene ke aarope main hai
 These complaints have been lodged by different persons at Golbari police station of Topiasia and Gariahat, Howrah, Kolkata
 ek shikayatakarta rajarshi lahiri ne kaha, "pehle unhonapradhanmantri ke khilaaf fatwazari kiya
 Even today said that no one can remove the red light of their vehicle
 isliye hamane police se unhen giraftaar karne or desh ke kanoon ke mutabik karrwai karne kii maang kii he
 "one of the complainants said," His intentionally provocative speeches are supposed to promote communal tension and spoil harmony
 "udhar, tamaam aalochanaon ke baavjood barkati apane puraane rukh par kaayam hai
 Barkati said, "what is my crime? Why should i be arrested
 sirf isliye ki main sach bolta hum
 Someone has so much power (to arrest me)
 
 
 main darataa nahin hum
 "on Friday, supporters of the BJP Yuva Morcha demonstrated in Central Kolkata for the immediate arrest of Barkati

 BJP national president Amit Shah on Wednesday gave a very simple formula and has set a target of winning 150 out of 182 seats in the state
 amit shah ne kaha, "jab narendra bhai (narendra modi) yahaan ke mukhyamantri the, hamane 120 siten jiti thim
 
 
 Now that he is the Prime Minister, we should win 150 seats
 
 
 " In Devalia village of Chhota Udaipur, a tribal area in central Gujarat, the BJP president went door-to-door in the three booth areas
 yah kshetra congress kaa majboot garh mana jaataa he, or bijepi adhyaksh ne party kaaryakartaaon se kaha, "ham koi bhi seat jeeten yaa haaren, devliya se nahin haarana he
 
 
 i myself have come among you to increase your enthusiasm
 
 
 " Now the assembly elections are just six months away, so the BJP has chosen this tribal area as part of its strategy to launch a booth management campaign by the party president
 darasal, paramparaagat rup se bijepi kaa samarthak mana jaataa rahaa shaktishaalee patel samudaay sarkari collejon tathaa naukariyon main aarakshan nahin die jane kii vajah se is baar sattashin party se naaraaz he, or chunki party anya samudaayon ke bich pakad or samarthan ko majboot karne kii koshish main he, isliye 15 pratishat janajaatiy vot usamen ahm bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai
 Significantly, tribal votes play an extremely important role in the state's 27 assembly seats, and can affect the results
 tippaniyan In Gujarat too, Amit Shah did what he has been doing in his recent visits to other states
 unhone devliya gaanv ke hi nivasee popat vasava ke ghar par dopaher kaa bhojan kiya, jinka parivaar kaaphi utsahit tha
 a completely new toilet is built in his house, and he is also given a permanent LPG connection
 bijepi adhyaksh ke liye bhojan gas stove par hi pakaaya gaya tha
 By the way, Popat Vasava has denied that these two are recent gifts, and is related to the visit of the BJP president
 unhone kaha, "hamane shauchalay lagbhag ek maheene pehle sarkari anudaan kii madad se banwaaya tha, or gas conection hamen bipiel (garibi rekha se neeche) shrenee main diya gaya he
 
 
 " gujarat amit shah ke saath-saath pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa bhi griharajya he, jahaan vah 13 saal tak mukhyamantri rahane ke baad varsh 2014 main centre sarkaar ko sanbhaalane ke liye dilli gaye the
 Since then, the party has won resounding victories in several state assembly elections, including Uttar Pradesh, and has now started a campaign to win Gujarat again
 gauratlab he ki is baar gujarat main bijepi kaa muqabla sirf paramparaagat pratidwandvi congress se hi nahin, dilli ke mukhyamantri kii aam aadmi party se bhi hoga
 Amit Shah said, "when Narendra Bhai (narendra Modi) was the chief minister here, we won 120 seats
 
 
 ab jab vah pradhanmantri hai, hamen 150 siten jeetni chahie
 
 
 " madhya gujarat ke janajaatiy ilaake chota udaipur sthit devliya gaanv main bijepi adhyaksh teen boothon ke ilaakon main ghar-ghar jaakar logon se mili
 The region is considered to be a stronghold of the Congress, and the BJP president told party workers, "we win or lose any seat, not to lose to Devalia

 Indeed, the powerful Patel community, traditionally considered a supporter of the BJP, is angry with the ruling party this time for not providing reservation in government colleges and jobs, and as the party tries to strengthen its hold and support among other communities Therefore, 15 percent of the tribal vote can play an important role in it
 gauratlab he ki rajya kii 27 vidhansabha siton par janajaatiy vot behad mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaate hai, or parinaamon ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 The comments gujarat main bhi amit shah ne vahi kiya, jo vah anya rajyon ke apane haalia dauron main karte aae hai

 unke ghar main bilkul nayaa shauchalay bana hua he, or unhen sthaayee rasoi gas conection bhi diya gaya he
 Food for the BJP president was cooked on the gas stove itself
 vaise, popat vasava ne is baat kaa khandan kiya he ki ye donon haalia tohfe hai, or unka taalluk bijepi adhyaksh ke daure se he
 He said, "we built toilets about a month ago with the help of government grants, and the gas connections have been given to us in the BPL (below Poverty Line) category

 The election results of Gujarat have forced the BJP to think over its plan for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 party rajya main jeet darj kar satta bachaane main to kaamyaab rahi lekin use mili 99 siten jis tarah mukhya rup se chaar shaharon main simati hai usne 2019 ke chunaav ke liye khatre kii ghanti baja di he
 BJP has got a clear message in these elections that it cannot win the political battle of 2019 only with the help of these four cities
 khaskar tab jab rajya kii sabhi 26 siton par usne 2014 main vijay hasil kii ho or uske paas paane ke liye kuch nahin lekin ganvaane ke liye puraa rajya padaa ho
 In 2019, the BJP not only has to preserve its votes in these cities but also to bring back the mass base in Saurashtra, South Gujarat and rural areas
 chunauti badi he isliye party ke netaa or modi ke kareebi abhi se taiyaari main jute gaye hai
 Gujarat is considered to be the strongest fortress of the BJP
 lekin 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main is durg ko bachaane main use nako chane chabane pade hai
 In 2019, this fort will once again be the victim of political attack and the party will have to prepare from now to win the battle

 While there are 127 seats in rural areas, of which Congress got 71 seats, BJP got 53 and others got three seats
 bijepi netaa bhi is baat ko dabi jubaan se sweekaar kar rahe hai ki bijepi chhathi baar jarur jeetne main safal rahi he, lekin gaanvon main bahut behatar nahin kar saki he
 If the party had better settled the dissatisfaction among the people and farmers of rural areas in time, then the BJP could have brought even better results in the political picture of the state

 In the Chhattisgarh assembly elections, the Congress has been struggling to end the exile of power for 15 years
 aise main party ne apane star prachaarak or punjab ke mantri navjot singh siddhu ko chunaav prachaar ke maidan main utaara to unhone do din main do congressi netaaon ko mukhyamantri pad kaa daavedaar bataa diya
 However, the party has not projected any leader as CM
 chhattisgarh vidhansabha chunaav prachaar ke aakhri din ravivaar ko navjot singh siddhu bikapur vidhansabha seat se chunaav maidan main utre congress ke varisht netaa ties singhdev ko ishaaron main bhavi siem pad bataaya
 Sidhu said in a shy style, 'two-in-one is available in the market, the candidates here are all-in-one
 'unhone kaha ki ho saktaa he 15 din ke baad inaki gaadi par badi si batti lag jaae or sadakon par syran sunai de
 Sidhu said that Singhdev has played an important role in preparing the public manifesto of the Congress and Congress President Rahul Gandhi trusts him a lot
 aise main sarkaar banane ke baad inaki bhoomika mahatvapurn hogi
 Sidhu, ahead of TS Singhdeo, contested from Sakti assembly seat by senior Congress leader Dr
 charandas manhat ko mukhyamantri pad kaa daavedaar bataaya tha
 Please tell that on Friday, the Congress candidate of Sakti Vidhan Sabha, Dr
 charandas mahant kaa prachaar karne pahunche siddhu ne janata se kaha tha, 'aapkaa vidhayak mukhyamantri ban saktaa he
 For this reason vote for the Congress
 'siddhu ne kaha ki sakti ko jila banane ke naam par bijepi ne baba ji kaa thullu diya he
 If our government comes, we will make it a district
 kisaanon kaa karj maaf or bijli bill aadha karenge
 For this, the voter will have to throw the BJP government ball out of the state's boundary line
 unhone yah tak kah diya ki yahaan se jo pratyaashee khadaa he, vah jitkar mukhyamantri ban saktaa he
 In one way, Sidhu's statement can work to kill pebbles in the stagnant waters of Chhattisgarh
 pichley do-dhai maheene main kai tarah se raajnneetik sameekaran bane or bigade hai
 Four-five months ago, there was competition among the contenders for the post of Chief Minister
 party ke bheetar machi is spardhaa ke baad rahul gandhi ne sabhi varisht netaaon ko dilli bulaayaa tha or sabase do took kaha tha ki koi bhi khud ko mukhyamantri kaa daavedaar hone kii baat nahin kahegaa
 In such a situation, Sidhu's statement has been unpalatable to the claimants of the post of CM, but he is refraining from giving controversy before giving any statement before the vote

 The Prime Minister said that a similar fear was spread when he started economic reforms in 1991 as Finance Minister
 unhone kaha ki is tarah kaa bhay failaane vaale tab bhi safal nahin hue the or ab bhi vah safal nahin ho paaenge
 Justifying the decision to increase the price of diesel and limit the number of cheap LPG cylinders to six per annum, he said that it was necessary to do so in order to prevent the difficult economic conditions and the fiscal deficit from rising as it would not in the price of essential commodities There was a huge increase
 singh ne kaha ki koi bhi sarkaar aam aadmi par boj nahin daalana chaahati, lekin sarkaar kii yah jimmedaari bhi he ki vah raashtra ke hiton kii raksha kare or apni janata ke dirghakaalik bhavishya kii suraksha kare
 He said that in the year 1991, we faced a similar problem
 koi bhi hamen choti rakam kaa karj bhi dene ko taiyaar nahin tha lekin majboot or thos kadamon kii badaulat ham us sankat se baahar aaye
 You can see the positive results of those steps
 unhone kaha ki aaj halaat vaise nahin hai lekin isse pehle ki janata kaa vishwaas hamaari arthvyavastha se uth jaae, hamen karrwai kerani hi chahie
 Singh said that the government is at such a point where it can reverse the slow pace of development
 hamen gharelu or vaishvik str par niveshkon ke vishwaas ko punerjeevit karnaa he
 For this purpose, it was necessary to take decisions which we made in the past
 multibrands retail main epadiai kii anumati dene, dijal keemat main paanch rupaye kii badhotari or sabsidi vaale alpiji silendaron kii sankhya simit karne ko lekar desh bhar main mache bavandar ke pariprekshya main pradhanmantri ne raashtra ke naam 15 minute ke sambodhan main majbootee ke saath sarkaar kaa paksh rakhaa
 If one finds similarities in films like Lage Raho Munnabhai, 3 Idiot and PK, hardly anyone disagrees that these films are songs written by Swanand Kirkire
 unke gane pehlepahal sunne par bas dhakk se lagate hai or phir ham sabhi ke phones or computaron main loop par chalane lagate hai
 Which has so far won the National Film Award thrice
 hawaaon se batiyate hue likhte hai geet
 
 
 What do songwriters and musicians do to get their best out? yahaan ham aapako bataate chalem ki swanand kirakire ne parinita film ke gane likhane ke kram main mumbai kii best bason main ghanton safar kiya he
 They are able to give their best by writing songs in fresh air
 ve aaj bhi apni car main baith kar geet likhte hai or computer kii keepad ke bajaay copy or pen kaa istemaal karte hai
 His songs touch the soul
 
 
 jisane bhi unke likhe geet sune hai wo bas unka hi hokar rah gaya he
 Whether you are a bird or a crazy mind
 unke dwaara likhe gaye gaye geet angadh or apane se lagate hai
 a songwriter who beautifully narrates our untold
 dukh main dhants bandhaata he or khushi ke maukey par bas jindagi main ras ghol detaa he

 Amit Shah took a committed initiative towards realizing the dream of bringing BJP to power from panchayat to parliament
 july 2014 main bhaajapa adhyaksh kaa padbhaar sanbhaalane ke baad bhaajapa ke vistaar ke liye unhone puure desh kaa daura kiya or party kaaryakartaaon ko jaagrit karne kaa kaam kiya
 Political analysts say Shah paved the way for the bjp's resounding victory in the election season by a brilliant mix of ideological perseverance, unlimited political imaginativeness and genuine political flexibility
 unhone bihar or maharashtra main na keval rajg ke ghatak dalon ke saath gathbandhan ko lekar lacheela rukh apanaaya balki sthaneey str par pratidwandvi dalon ke vot bank ko apni party ke paale main laane kii ranneeti ko anjaam diya
 Apart from this, there were also alliances in states like Tamilanadu and Kerala
 purvottar main gathbandhan ke parinaam spasht rup se saamne aae hai
 Election management player Shah first handled the election management of senior BJP leader LK Advani in the 1991 Lok Sabha elections in Gandhinagar
 lekin, unke booth prabandhan kaa karishma 1995 ke upachunaav main tab najar aayaa, jab sabarmati vidhansabha seat par tatkaaleen up mukhyamantri narhari amin ke khilaaf chunaav lard rahe adhivaktaa yatin ojha kaa chunaav prabandhan unhen saunpa gaya
 Yatin himself says that Shah sees nothing but politics
 unke kareebi bataate hai ki paariwarik or saamaajik mail-milaap main vah bahut kam vakt jaaya karte hai
 Shah has a good grasp of the workers and is an expert player in organization and management
 shah ne pehali baar sarkhez se 1997 ke vidhansabha upachunaav main kismat aajamaayi or tab se 2012 tak lagaataar paanch baar vahaan se vidhayak chune gayi
 Sarkhej's victory established him as a young and fiery leader in Gujarat
 us jeet ke baad vah bhaajapa main lagaataar seedhiyaan chadhate gaye
 Shah emerged more strongly after Modi became the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 2003 se 2010 tak gujarat sarkaar kii cabinet main unhone grih mantralay kaa jimmaa sambhala
 Though he faced many political ups and downs in the meantime, when Narendra Modi was brought to the national political scene, his closest confidant Amit Shah was also included in the bjp's campaign across the country
 uttar pradesh main unhone loksabhaa chunaav main party ko 80 main se 71 siton par jeet dilava kar apni raajnneetik kshamta bhi sabit kii
 Shah's strategy behind the bjp's success is also considered important in the Tripura assembly elections
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi unhone puure desh main kareeb 500 chunaav samitiyon kaa gathan kiya or kareeb 7000 netaaon ko tainaat kiya
 He paid special attention to 120 such seats in the party's election campaign where BJP had not won the election earlier
 unhone party ke abhiyaan ko chalaane ke liye 3000 purnakalik kaaryakartaaon ko tainaat kiya
 According to Australia's legendary leg-spinner Shane Warne, a strong contender for the title before the ICC World T20 in a semi-final match against the West Indies had to pay a heavy price out of the tournament

 Due to lack of confidence, they are not able to put their point firmly in front of others, as a result there is trouble for themselves

 baat karne kaa abhyaas karen- agar aapmen aatmavishvaas kii kami he to aaine ke saamne khadey hokar baat karne kaa abhyaas karen
 Then look at your body language and practice talking with your eyes
 baat karne kii is prakriya ko apane dimag main rakhen or ise doharaate rahen
 - We often think about the reaction of the person before talking, he will not feel bad, he will not get angry, what will he think for us
 
 But the reality is that if we talk with confidence and conviction, the person in front of us will understand and respect you
 dusron ko barabari kaa samajhekapana najariya dusron ke saamne rakhane se pehle yaa koi bhi baatcheet karte vakt is baat kaa dhyaan rakhen ki koi aapse behatar yaa koi aapse kam nahin he
 Listen to the whole thing in front of you, appreciate their words and at the same time, talk with you and tell them that they are fine too, but your view is slightly different

 While talking, keep in mind that you are not making fun of the front, especially when you are in a group

 In Maharashtra, the BJP is still at loggerheads between Uddhav Thackeray and Raj Thackeray
 kal mumbai kii ek hotel main bijepi ke purv adhyaksh nitin gadakari or raaj thakare kii mulaakaat se rajya kaa siyaasi maahaul itnaa garma gaya ki uddhav thakare ne rajya bijepi adhyaksh devendra fadanvis ko apane ghar bula kar unase maharashtra navnirmaan sena ke bare main party kaa rukh spasht karne ko kaha
 The bjp-shiv Sena alliance wants to win at least 30 seats this time in Maharashtra's 48 seats
 bijepi ne iske liye pahal kii he
 The party has tried to form a grand alliance in the state
 isamen paanch partiyaan shaamil hai
 These are BJP, Shiv Sena, Ramdas Athawale's RPI (A), Raju Shetty's Swabhimaan Shetkari Organization and Mahadev Jhankar's RSP
 gathbandhan banane ke liye bijepi ne kai samjhaute kiye
 He has also sent Ramdas Athawale to the Rajya Sabha, ignoring the claim of his militant leader Prakash Javadekar
 lekin raaj thakare ke bina kya ye vaaki mahayuti kahala saktaa he? The BJP feels that unless Raj Thackeray comes with it, his dream of blowing up the congress-ncp alliance cannot be realized
 lekin raaj ko saath lene main sabase badi dikkat uddhav thakare kaa virodh he
 bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi has a very friendly relationship with Raj Thackeray and the Shiv Sena does not like it
 modi kii ummidavaari ko lekar uddhav thakare asahaj rahe hai
 Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray once named Sushma Swaraj for this
 vajah ye bataai gai thi ki wo nahin chaahate the ki maharashtra main hindutv ke naam par chal rahi unki raajnneeti main modi dakhal de
 By the way, Uddhav has the support of Modi's candidature
 2009 ke lok sabha chunaav main raaj thakare ne bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ko nuksaan pahunchaa kar apni takat dikhaai thi
 There are at least ten Lok Sabha seats where MNS helped Congress or NCP win by cutting bjp-shiv Sena votes
 udhaaharan ke liye mumbai dakshin lok sabha seat ko hi len
 From here, congress-ncp candidate Milind Deora got 272411 votes while bjp-shiv Sena candidate Mohan Rawale got 146118 votes
 emenes ke ummidavaar bala nandagaanvkar ko 159729 vot mili
 That is, if the votes of bjp-shiv sena-mns are mixed, then they are around three lakhs
 is lihaaz se milind devda ye seat haar bhi sakate the
 In the Lok Sabha elections, Raj Thackeray's party was particularly seen in seats like Mumbai South, Mumbai South Central, Mumbai North Central, Mumbai North West Mumbai North West, Mumbai North, Nashik, Bhiwandi, Thane and Pune
 in das siton main emenes ko ek lakh se zyaada vot mili or ye sari siten bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan haar gaya
 The bjp-shiv Sena alliance got 29 percent of the votes in this Lok Sabha election
 lekin agar raaj thakare saath hote to ye gathbandhan 33 fisadi tak pahunch saktaa tha
 In the assembly elections held six months later, Raj Thackeray's party won 13 seats with four and a half percent votes
 ab 2009 ek baar phir khud ko dohraane ke liye taiyaar dikh rahaa he
 This time the problem of bjp-shiv Sena is that Aam Aadmi Party is also in the fray with Raj Thackeray to dent his votes
 sambhaavna vyakt kii ja rahi he ki mumbai, pune or nagpur jaise ilaakon main arvind kejariwal kii party ko thik-thaak vot mil sakate hai
 These are the same seats that the bjp-shiv Sena alliance will not be able to increase its strength without snatching it from the congress-ncp
 isiilie agar raaj thakare lok sabha chunaav na lard kar sirf modi ko samarthan dete bhi dikhte hai, to bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ko phayda ho saktaa he
 But the BJP will have to pay its price
 vidhansabha chunaav ke liye raaj thakare ko 35 se 40 siten di ja sakati hai
 But, of course Shiv Sena is hardly ready to give its share
 yani is par bhi bijepi ko hi samjhauta karnaa pad saktaa he
 The question is also whether the Shiv Sena will approve any such agreement or not? Seeing the sharp attitude Uddhav has shown yesterday, it seems that BJP may face difficulties in reaching this agreement
 dilli gangrape ke baad sabko mahila utpeedan ke khilaaf sakht kanoon banane kii yaad aa rahi he
 Whereas, in the same session, when the Criminal Law Amendment Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha on December 4, no one could see it
 ab satta paksh or vipaksh donon ye bayaan de rahe hai ki rape or mahilaon ke khilaaf hone vaale duusare aparaadh ke khilaaf taiyaar is bill ko jaldi paas karakar nayaa kanoon bananaa chahie
 On Wednesday too, the gang rape of Delhi showed anger
 endie se judi mahila saansadon ne loksabhaa main is par bahes kii maang kii
 Here, the BJP said it would introduce amendments to the Criminal Law Amendment Bill 2012 and would demand capital punishment for rape
 enditivi se baatcheet main bijepi netaa vankeya naidu ne kaha ki maujuuda kanoon rape ke maamalon ko rokane main naakaam rahaa he or doshiyon ko or sakht sazaa dena zaruri ho gaya he
 By the way, this bill introduced in the Lok Sabha in this session, there is a matter of punishment and hardening of sexual offenses
 agar ye bill paas hua to yon hamalon ke liye kam se kam 7 saal kii sazaa hogi
 The comments agar yon hamale ke liye koi police yaa sarkari afasar yaa apni haisiyat kaa istemaal kar rahaa koi manager yaa adhikari zimmedaar paaya jaataa he to use kam se kam das saal kii bamashkkat qaid se lekar umraqaid tak ho sakati he
 Minister of State for Home RPN Singh said that the government will take every possible initiative to pass this bill
 haalanki congress kaa maananaa he ki balaatkaar ke liye faansee kii sazaa thik nahin
 Party spokesperson Renuka Chowdhury believes there are better options than hanging and should be seriously considered

 Speaking to NDTV, BJP leader Venkaiah Naidu said that the current law has failed to stop rape cases and it has become necessary to punish the culprits more severely

 grih rajyamantri arpyen singh ne kaha ki sarkaar is bill ko paas karaane ke liye har sambhav pahal karegi
 However, Congress believes that hanging for rape is not good
 party kii pravaktaa renuka choudhary maanati hai ki faansee se behatar vikalp hai or unpar gambhirtha se vichaar hona chahie

 On the second day of the three-day coordination meeting between the various organizations associated with the Sangh and the BJP, the issue of disinvestment of state-run airline Air India and inflation of petrol and diesel may come up

 iske alaava modi sarkaar kii vibhinn aarthik nitiyon ke maamle main apana feedback bhi denge
 According to sources, the issue of disinvestment of Air India and increase in prices of petrol and diesel may also arise in the meeting
 sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne isse pehle spasht taur par kaha tha ki air india ko kisi videshi kharidaar ko nahin bechaa janaa chahie
 Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh and Swadeshi Jagran Manch are also opposing the disinvestment of Air India in the current manner
 manch kaa kahana he ki air india ko parichaalan munafa ho rahaa he lekin baari karj kii vajah se vah ghate main chal rahi he
 The forum suggested that the government should monetise its assets to pay the debt of this national airline
 bataa den ki centre kii modi sarkaar ne air india kii 76 fisadi hissedari or prabandhan niyantran bechney ke liye icchhuk companiyon se 'aashay patr' aamantrit kiya he

 Concerned about the formation of the government, the RSS sources say that the Union leadership is satisfied with the policies of the government, but it is definitely worried about the public perception about its functioning
 janata ke bich sarkaar kii jo dharna ban rahi he, usko badalane ke liye sangh june maheene ke tisare saptaah se janata ke bich sarkaar ke saamaajik kaaryon kaa bakhaan apane swayan sevakon ke zarie karegaa
 There is no doubt about the remote control of this government with Prime Minister Modi, but it is an exaggeration to say that the Union reviews the policies and plans of the government
 modi sarkaar kii yojanaon or nitiyon ko jo bhi badlaav hote hai wo sangh se jude hue sanghathanon kii ground report ke aadhaar par hote hai
 This may indicate that the Sangh holds importance for the Modi government and the BJP

 riki ponting bole, rishabh pant kii batting dekhne ke liye paisa kharch karne ko bhi taiyaar hum a few days ago, the news of the death of ISIS kingpin Baghdadi was reported in an attack, though neither has Baghdadi come forward nor has he confirmed his death since that news
 kamjor hota ISIS, aaazaad hote shaharyah khabar aane ke baad se ISIS kamjor jarur hota ja rahaa he
 After areas such as Ramadi, Tirakit and Sinjar, the Iraqi city of Faluja has now left ISIS
 ISIS ke kabje se aaazaad, ye shahar he faluziracki rajdhani baghdad se mahaj 65 kilometre dur maujuud ek aisa shahar, jis par duniya ke sabase khaufnak aatankwaadi sanghathan ISIS ne sabase pehle kabja kiya tha
 But the fighters of the Iraqi Army, Counter Terrorism Unit, Iraqi Federal Police, Anbar Provincial Police and recognized militias finally did what they were waiting for after a week-long war, which was to free Faluja from ISIS occupation To get it done
 faluja kii jashn-e-aazaadee kii keemtfaluja ne is din ke liye jo or jaisi keemat chukaai he, use yaad kar is shahar ke log ab bhi sihar uthte hai
 For two years, the city slept everyday amid the noise of bullets
 goliyon kii shor ke bich hi jaagta rahaa
 Here, the only meaning of not obeying the terrorists was death and to obey the order was to die mole
 halaat kuch aise hue ki shahar main aatankwaadiyon kisankaur phogiyon se chalate aamane-saamne kii jang main dasiyon log apni jaan ganvaa baithte or takreeban 85 hajaar logon ko apane-apane kunbe kii hifaazat ke liye apana hi ghar-baar chhod kar khud apane mulk main visthapiton kii jindagi jini padi
