 sanjay dutt kii nani banengi shabana azmi The case of Bhagat Singh being described as a terrorist in a book by Delhi University is hot
 itihaaskaar or netaa iskaa kadaa virodh kar rahe hai
 In a university book, Indian revolutionary and socialist Shaheed Bhagat Singh has been called a terrorist
 darasal yah dilli uniwarsity ke hindi madhyam karyanvay nideshaalay kii ore se prakashit'bharat kaa swatantraaa sangharsh'kitaab ke ek chapter main bhagat singh or unke saathiyon ko jagah-jagah aatankwaadi likhaa gaya he
 This case of calling Bhagat Singh a terrorist has been hot
 janata dal you ke mahasachiv kasee tyaagi ne is maamle ko rajyasabha main uthaane kii baat kahi he
 At the same time, Bhagat Singh's family has objected to this
 bhagat singh ke chote bhai kulbir singh ke pote ne shiksha mantri smriti irani ko patr likhaa he
 The 20th chapter of the book is titled 'bhagat Singh, Surya Sen and Revolutionary Terrorists'
 pustak kaa pehla sanskaran 1990 main prakashit hua tha
 In this regard, the famous historian Irfan Habib has said that the British considered Bhagat Singh a terrorist and we are also carrying this tradition
 dollar ke mukaable girte rupye kii kahani ab nai nahin
 The price of 1 dollar has crossed Rs 71
 bazaaron (share, camodity, karansi) ko technical charts par padhane vaale export is giravat ke or gahraane kaa andeshaa jataa rahe hai
 The sharp fall of the rupee from the current level can have serious consequences
 gauratlab he ki saal kii shuruyaat se ab tak dollar ke mukaable rupaya 10
 More than 50 percent has become weak
 takneekee chart par daraavnee tasweerindex jeniyas investment adwisers ke nideshak amit hacharekar kehete hai ''technical chart par rupye ne paanch saal ke daayre ko todaa he
 That is to get out of it after wandering in a big circle for five years
 takneekee bhashaa main ise longturm technical brakeout kehete hai
 There is a possibility of big moves after such break out
 share bazaar ke pramukh suchakank nifti ne 2014 main paanch saal kaa brake out todaa tha
 (see below breakout chart of both Nifty and rupee) Since then, 86% has been seen in Nifty so far
 ''rupye ne bhi agar isi tarah ke pattern ko follow kiya to 1 dollar kii keemat kaa anumaan hi arthshaatriyon ke paseene chhudaane ko kaaphi he
 However, experts are not expecting any major fall in the market right now and 73
 50 ke str ko aglaa ahm saport (samarthan str) maan ke chal rahe hai
 As a result of this decline, the decline of the common man due to the serious decline, leave the matter of the budget of the country
 videsh main ghoomana or padhai karne se itar kamjor rupaya sarkaar kaa aayaat bill badhayega
 The burden of fiscal deficit may increase further
 agar rupaya aane vaale maheenon main 80-85 jaise str dikhaata he, to jaraa un karjon ke bare main sochie jo bhartiya companiyon ne videsh se le rakhen hai yaa lene vaale hai
 In case of big loans, one should not forget the huge debt for projects like bullet train
 yah karj agar bharat ko 0 fisadi par bhi mila hoga tab bhi isko chukaane ke liye pehle se zyada rupye foonkane honge
 It is no longer just rbi's! In the coming weeks, the foreign exchange reserves of the Reserve Bank of India will be seen to fall below $ 400 billion
 aapako bataa den rupye ko saport dene ke liye arabiai jo dollar bechata he, uskaa asar 2 hafte baad dekhne ko miltaa he
 That is, the effect of the workout of the past is yet to be seen
 70 ke str ke baad arabiai rupye ko saport dene main kitna sahaj hoga yah dekhnaa baaki he
 The world currency had declined against the dollar
 rupaya philhal is giravat se achoota tha
 Experts believed that the rupee depreciated until around 70
 lekin iske aage kii giravat shaayad desi or videshi donon ho sakate hai
 What steps the government takes to stop the weakness of the rupee, it remains to be seen
 *** The Hollywood film Godfather is considered one of the classiest films in the world
 saal 1972 main ai is film ko kai mahaan nirdeshkon, sinefiles, critics or cinemai panditon ne film ko kai myanon main benchmark ghoshit kiya he
 However, Chunky Pandey's daughter and actress Ananya Pandey does not think so
 ananyaa pandey ne haal hi main pinkavila ke saath ek intervyuu main is film ko overrated kaha he
 Meaning they feel that this film is not very good and it is unnecessarily so hyped
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki logon kii kisi bhi film ko lekar alag raay ho sakati he chaahe wo kitni hi behtareen film kyon naa ho
 Something similar was seen when Orsen Welles' masterpiece film Citizen Kane was described as boring on Hollywood's famous TV show Friends, and the show was also trolled

 Ananya said that she has not seen this film because it is overrated
 isi ke chalate ve twitor par kaaphi trol hone lageen
 a man wrote about Ananya that "ananya Pandey feels that the Godfather is overrated
 chanki pandey ko duniya ke saamne apni beti kii baat ko lekar maafee maangani chahie
 "one person wrote," If an actor feels that Godfather is an overrated film, then he should leave acting and join mental hospital
 " vahiin ek shaks kaa kahana tha, "godfadar nahin balki chanki pandey overrated hai, kyonki unhone abhi tak unhen acting karte hue nahin dekha he
 "talking about the workfront, Ananya Pandey is in the news for her film Husband, Wife and She

 In Iraq's capital Baghdad, a double bomb blast on Monday killed 13 people
 samachar agency sinhua ke mutabik donon visphot thode antaraal ke bheetar hi hue
 The attack injured 22 people, including nine security personnel
 visphot baghdad ke vashash jile main hua
 Given the situation created after the Uri attack, there is constant pressure on the government to take action against Pakistan
 isi dawaab ke chalate sarkaar pakistan ke saath hui inds water treety ko risive karne par vichaar kar rahaa he
 Several rounds of meetings have been held in the ministry regarding this
 mantralay ke sutron ke hawaale sepakistanke saath jo pani ko lekar sandhi hui he, usko rivyuu karne ke baad koi faisla legaa
 India believes that when this agreement was reached that India's interests were not taken into consideration at that time
 isliye ab isaki samiksha karnaa jaruri ho gaya he
 Keeping this in mind, the Ministry of Water Resources has held several meetings to review this agreement
 bharat kaa maananaa he ki pani ko lekar jo bharat kaa haq he, usko nazarandaaj kiya gaya he or usko thik kiya jayega
 Since the Uri attack, the demand has once again intensified that India should stop the waters of the Indus region going to Pakistan
 19 sitambar 1960 kopradhanmantri jawaharlal nehruaur pakistan ke raashtrapati general ayub khan ne is par dastakhat kiye the
 Under this, India gives Pakistan 80 per cent of the water of the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab rivers through its territory
 bharat ko in nadiyon ke sirf 20 fisadi pani ke istemaal kii ijaajat he
 Meanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh has also demanded a review of the Indus Water Convention
 uskaa kahana he ki jammu kashmir kii janata bhi maanati he ki is samjhaute se nuksaan hua he
 The Ministry of Water Resources has also held several rounds of meetings regarding this agreement
 sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki jab yah 1907 main samjhauta kiya gaya tha us vakt desh kii janata ke hiton ko nazarandaaj kiya gaya tha
 Deputy Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Nirmal Singh says that concrete action should be taken against Pakistan in the manner in which Pakistan is doing insanity, this time it will definitely take whatever steps the central government is taking and if necessary, it will take more of Indus water agreement About Nirmal Singh says that the people of Jammu and Kashmir believe that this should be reviewed, action should be taken on Nirmal Singh's It is said that the Indus Waters Treaty has caused a loss to Jammu and Kashmir
 isi samjhaute ko lekar ab yah sawaal uth rahaa he ki bharat pakistan jaise padosi ko zyada pani kaise de saktaa he
 There is usually a 50-50 split in such agreements
 lekin bharat ke tab ke pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru ne 80 fisadi pani pakistan ko dene ke samjhaute par khud karachi jaakar dastakhat kiye the
 Experts believe that due to this agreement, it is difficult to get power projects across Jammu and Kashmir, even in the projects which are currently underway, water could not be dammed by stopping the water
 agar in nadiyon ke pani kaa istemaal bharat bhi kar saktaa to isse puure jammu-kashmir or aasapaas ke rajyon main khushhaali aati
 If power plants were built on them, then thousands of MW of electricity could be generated, which would benefit the entire country
 jaankaron kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki bharat chaahe to sindhu jal samjhaute ko ri-nigoshiet yani dobaaraa baatcheet kaa prastaav rakh saktaa he
 Many countries of the world have been taking such steps according to time and circumstances
 shuukravaar jammu kashmir main badhati aabaadi kii vajah se pani kii maang kai guna bad chuki he
 If this water comes to the state, it will generate more power, develop agriculture and create new employment opportunities
 jaankaron kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki sindhu kshetra kii hi teen purvi nadiyon satluj, beas or raavi ke pani kaa bhi bada hissaa aaj bhi pakistan ja rahaa he
 Whereas under the treaty it is not necessary to give water of these small rivers to Pakistan
 bharat chaahe to aaraam se dam banaakar in nadiyon kaa puraa pani roak saktaa he
 Projects like Indira Gandhi Canal, sutlej-yamuna Link Canal and Thien Dam are currently underway here
 jaruri he ki in tamaam projects ko jaldi se jaldi puraa kiya jaae taaki puraa pani apane desh ke liye kaam aa sake
 To end the Indus water treaty, the government is under pressure that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should abolish this treatment so that Pakistan can be taught a lesson

 ’ In the last four years, we have not known how many times we have shown news related to Baghdadi and ISIS, many times it was thought to understand it closely and know how someone can be so heartless

 To know this, the team of Aaj Tak reached Mosul so that the ground reality can be brought to you
 22 aktubar ko hamen pataa chalaa ki videsh rajya mantri general wike singh 39 laapata hindustanishon kii talash ke liye iraq ja rahe hai
 Our senior correspondent Shams Tahir Khan left for Baghdad from Delhi with his colleague Gaurav Sawant and cameraman Kripal Singh on the night of 23 October as soon as the news was received
 baghdad ke liye bharat se koi direct flite nahin he
 So our team first reached Dubai from Delhi
 iske baad dubai se duusari flite pakad kar 23 aktubar kii shaam hamaari team sthaneey samay ke mutabik thik sarh paanch baje baghdad airport pahunchi
 Our team had no idea about Baghdad
 hamaari team ko ye bhi pataa nahin tha ki ve kahaan jaaenge kaise jaaenge kahaan thahrenge? airport se baahar aate-aate raat ke aath baj chuke the
 After this, they changed two taxis and reached Karada area of baghdad
 airport par hamaari team ko kisi ne bataaya ki wo jagah thik he or vahaan hotel bhi aasaani se mil jayega
 Around ten o'clock at night, our team checked in at the Life Palace Hotel in Karada Outer
 bhartiya duutavas pahunchi ajtak kii tingle din subah-subah hamaari team baghdad main bhartiya duutavas pahunchi
 He was to meet General VK Singh here and information about the journey ahead was to be found from here
 hamaari team ko pataa tha ki 39 bharatiyon kii talash ke liye hamen mosul, badoosh or irbil janaa padegaa
 These three places were extremely dangerous
 vahaan ab iraqi forcej, kurdish, baagiyon auraisake khilaaf jhadap jari thi
 By midday, our team came to know that the Minister of State for External Affairs had reached Baghdad and was staying in the Green Zone area of baghdad
 green jone ilaaka matlab baghdad kaa sabase mahfuj ilaaka
 In the Indian Embassy itself, our team met with General VK Singh
 unhone hamaari team ko apane plan ke bare main bataaya
 Our team was confident that they would go to Mosul with the Minister of State for External Affairs
 baghdad se mosul tak kareeb 410 kilometre kaa safar sadak ke raste tay karnaa behad khatarnaak tha
 Because the roads were deserted and the presence of ISIS in many places is still intact
 par dushwari ye thi ki mosul airport band tha
 Our team Mosul could only go with the convoy of General VK Singh under the protection of Iraqi forces
 lekin ain vakt par hamen pataa chalaa ki general wike singh iraqi sena ke vishesh vimaan se mosul ravaanaa ho gaye
 VK Singh General, who went to Mosul alone, the news of VK Singh going to Mosul alone was a shock to our team
 unhen samaj nahin aa rahaa tha ab kya karen? kaise mosul pahunche? harek ne hamaari team ko samajhaayaa ki sadak ke raste mosul jane kaa iraadaa chhod do
 There is a lot of danger
 par doosraa koi rasta bhi nahin tha vahaan tak pahunchane kaa
 And we had to reach Mosul in any case
 isse pehle hamaari team ko baghdad pahunchane ke duusare hi din ye bataaya gaya ki baghdad main ye khabar fail chuki he ki hind ke teen sahaafee yani bharat ke teen jarnlist yahaan gum rahe hai
 This news was bad for us
 kyonki hame bataaya gaya tha ki baghdad main beshak iesas kaa asar utana nahin he
 But their sleeper cells are still hidden here
 hamen salaah di gai ki fouran hotel badal lo
 So our team changed its hotel in the night and decided to leave Baghdad in the morning and go to Mosul
 agali subah taxi badal-badal kar hamaari baghdad se mosul ke safar par nikal padi
 The team did not know whether they would be able to reach their destination or not
 raste main har thodi duuri par sena or police ke check post the
 The driver was constantly warning our team to hide the camera
 yahaan tak ki mobile se bhi kuch shoot naa karen
 But where our team got a chance, they continued to shoot quietly with mobile or camera
 najar aae barbaadi ke nishantaji, balad tak to thik tha par uske baad jaise hi hamaari team aage badi, bagdadi ke haathon barbaadi ke nishaan saaf najar aane lage
 Aajtak's team passed through those areas, where the presence of Dahesh ie ISIS still exists
 digel, rafiya or samara hote hue hamaari team lagaataar mosul ke kareeb ja rahi thi
 The driver of our team had already told that he would drive the taxi only in sunlight
 shaam kaa saafar riski thi
 So before evening, Aaj Tak's team would have stayed at some safe place
 subah hote hi safar phir shuru ho jaataa
 The journey so far between all fear and panic was fine
 magar iske baad pehali baar hamaari team ko ahsaas hua ki ve kis khatarnaak safar par the
 The team's interpreter close to Samra said that Daisch had blown up some houses in the area
 dhamaake ke nishaan or barbaadi ke khandhar vahaan ab bhi maujuud hai
 We immediately decided that we would shoot those ruins
 lihaaja hamane gaadi haive se kachche raste par utaar di or phir paidal hi chal pade or ye hamaari ab tak kii sabase badi galati thi
 a secluded village-like area where no one could see far and wide
 vahaan achaanak hamaari team ko paanch-chah log najar aae
 The team thought to talk to them
 itarprator ne kaha tha ki jab tak wo naa kahe ham camera yaa mobile se kisi khandhar yaa aadmi ko shoot nahi karenge
 So first we went close to them
 iske baad hamaare interprator ne unase arabi jubaan main unhen bataaya ki ham hindi sahaafee yani bhartiya patrkaar hai or bas yaheen galati ho gai
 Camera and Mike snatched from the team, then two of them snatched our team's camera and mic
 phir unamem se ek ne hamaari team ko ishaara kar ek taraf chalane ko kaha
 In Arabic, he was probably speaking dush-dakhul by pointing to the bushes
 yani udhar daakhil hone ko kah rahaa tha
 The team did not know who those people were
 hamaari team shiya-sunni ke jhagade main funs gai thi? ye daaish samarthak thea yaa phir gussaye sthanise log yaa phir koi or? hamaari team ko kuch nahin pataa chalaa
 But perhaps our team's luck was good, because at the same time the voice of Cyron was heard from a distance
 ghabrahat kii vajah se pehle hamen laga ki ajaan kii aawaaj he
 But then two or three vehicles of the Iraqi army were seen coming away on patrol
 unhen dekhte hi wo paanch chah log achaanak hamaari team kaa camera or mike phenkate hue vahaan se bhaag gaye
 Now our team felt that they are safe
 par sanbhalane main unhen aadha ghante se bhi zyada kaa vakt lag gaya
 This incident had such an impact on the three of us that we just decided that we will not go further
 bas waapas dilli lautnaa he
 But perhaps a lot more had to happen
 vahaan se nikalne ke baad ek check post par hamen iraqi special forcej ke kuch jawan mili
 When one of them came to know that we are from India, he was very happy
 darasal wo doollywood filmon kaa divaana tha or amitabh bachchan kaa bahut bada fain
 He took us to his general
 hamane general ko apane aane kaa makasad bataaya ki ham 39 laapata bharatiyon kii talash ke liye aae hai
 The Iraqi army squad gained courage after this, now our team was with the Iraqi Forces
 iraq aane ke baad se pehali baar laga ki ve mahfuj hai
 He agreed to take our team with him to show the ruined area at the hands of Baghdadi
 un ilaakon main khatra ab bhi barkaraar tha
 But now he was with them
 thodi der baad hamaari team us ilaake main the jahaan daaish ne abhi haal main hi ghar, dukaan sabhi ko dhamaake main uda kar khandhar bana diya tha
 Destruction and destruction were everywhere
 hamaari team ko iraqi forcej ne bataaya ki is ilaake main ab bhi khatra tala nahin he
 But he was repeatedly convincing our team that he is safe with them
 gaanv ke andar tak jagah-jagah check post bane the, jinamein iraqi force tainaat thi
 Then our team was introduced to the people there
 jinhone hamaari team ko bagdadi or uske aantak kii kahani sunai
 They returned to the check post after visiting the village with the Iraqi army
 unhone hamaari team ko apane javaanon ke saath khaanaa khilaayaa or is taakid ke saath hamen vidaa kar diya ki ab or aage naa jaaen
 That is, do not go towards Mosul
 magar ab tak hamaari team sanbhal chuki thi or un par phir se mosul jane kaa junun haaavee ho chukaa tha
 So once again our team moved forward
 mosul kii taraf
 The team of Aaj Tak reached Mosul after playing life, now the driver of our team was also an interpreter
 par use angreji nahin aati thi
 Our team led the way
 mobile par google translator ke jariye apni baat angreji se arabi main bataai or driver arabi se angreji main hamaari team ko bataata rahaa, lekin wo driver is baat par raji nahin tha ki hamaari team mosul jaae
 He said this by translating us from Arabic to English on mobile
 hamaari team jaise-jaise mosul ke kareeb ja rahi thi, unki bechaini badhati ja rahi thi
 We were constantly listening to the story of Mosul and its ruin
 ah wo hamaare behad kareeb tha
 But then we came to know that firing has started again in Mosul between Kurdish fighter, rebel and Iraqi forces for two days
 par ham phir bhi aage badhate rahe
 But from now on, there was a second danger
 hamen bataaya gaya ki jagah-jagah raste main bagdadi ke barood bichhe ho sakate hai
 Therefore you have to be careful
 aakhirkaar wo ghadi aa hi gai jab hamaari team mosul shahar ke saamne thi
 Mosul means Iraq's second largest city after Baghdad
 mosul yani wo shahar jisane pehali baar duniya ko malamal kaa kapadaa diya
 And because of the same muslin, it was named Muslin and then Mosul
 shahar kaa manjar cheekh-cheekh kar kah rahaa tha ki ye insaanon kii basti nahin balki bhuton kaa shahar he
 The houses were transformed into ruins and ruins houses
 aisa lagata tha maano puure shahar par hi bam gira diya gaya ho
 Where the bomb failed to do its job, the bullet marks were screaming on the wall
 har taraf pasra tha sannatinsaan naam kii cheez nahin thi
 Those who were just kept quiet
 yaa phir ghani bastiyon main the
 As far as we were not allowed to go, neither would it be the right decision
 kyonki kis insaan ke bhesh main koun dushman nikal aae nahin maaloom
 Whether or what step falls on which pile of ammo hidden in the ground is not known
 mosul shahar pehle bahut khushnuma or jindadil shahar tha
 Which cannot be described in words
 lekin 10 june 2014 ke baad mosul main achaanak bagdadi or uske aatanki aae
 They destroyed the city in three years with bombs, guns and ammo
 ab dur-dur tak tuuti padi imaaraten, khandhiron main tabdeel makaan, barbaad sadaken, jagah-jagah malbe ke dher or fijaa main bikhri barood kii baichaiyn karne vaali bu hi yahaan maujuud he
 The ruined mosul is actually the result of a three-year-old ISIS struggle against Iraq
 wo hasil, jiske bare main aam iraqiyon ne to kya khud kabhi iesas ke khaliph abu bakar al bagdadi or uske gurgon ne bhi nahin sochaa hoga
 But seeing what the state of ISIS has done to a settled city, now the common Iraqis are crying tears of blood
 skool-kalege, dukaan-bazaar, aspataal, daphtar-restaraan kuch bhi to nahin bachaa he yahaan par
 Those who are left are also crying over their fate
 lekin ye to rahi duniyavi chizon kii baat iesas kii aag main jhulas kar mosul ne thik kitni zindagiyaan ganvaai hai, sach puuchhie to iskaa sahi-sahi hisaab philhal kisi ke paas nahin
 The people of Mosul had given up hope of breathing in Azad Fiza
 laga ki jaise ab jindagi inhen sangeenon ke saaye main guzaregi
 But eventually ISIS was eradicated from Mosul
 mosul vahi jagah he jahaan se bagdadi ne apni khilaafat or iesas kii hukumat kaa elaan kiya tha
 But now the terrorists have been chased from here
 puure saade teen saal baad mosul se bagdadi ke aatank kii baraat aakhirkaar nikal hi gai
 But how much time will it take for Mosul to become a city of humans from the city of ghosts
 39 bharatiyon kii talashmosul kii jamini hakeekat or tasviren hamaari team ke saamne thim
 But the answer to that question was not yet found, for which our team went from India to there
 mosul main 39 bharatiyon kii talash thi
 His clue was to be found
 lekin ye kaam itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 Because most people here did not know anything about those missing Indians
 rahi iraqi sena or intelligence kii baat to unke paas koi pukhta saboot yaa phir jaankaree kii kami thi
 But we still had to try
 lihaaza iske baad hamaari team phir se 39 laapata bharatiyon kii talash main jute gai
 Indeed, the missing Indians were last seen in the Badush area of mosul
 par kis jagah kisi ko nahin pataa
 Therefore, the Minister of State for External Affairs also reached here in search of him
 unhone baqayada ek raat mosul ke andar guzari
 After talking to all the people and Iraqi intelligence, our team realized that the truth is that no one has concrete information about those missing Indians
 isiilie khud videsh rajyamantri ne bhi bina kisi nattejey ke talash kaa kaam puraa hone kaa elaan kar diya
 One reason for this is that the Iraqi government also has no news or record of the missing Indian
 ab talash naammumkidab le-dekar aakhri ummid diene report par hi he
 The Indian government has handed over DNA samples of 39 Indians to Iraqi authorities
 yani iraqi data base se 39 bharatiyon kaa diene match kar gaya to thik varna ye talash adhuri hi rah jaaegi
 By the way, the most bitter truth of this biggest search of Iraq is that it is now impossible to find the address of 39 missing Indians

 Vottisari is a student of class
 har din wo 4 baje shaam main skool se ghar aati hai
 She then decorates books outside her home, telling stories to inspire children to read

 bhartiya cinema khaskar hindi filmon main (meri bhashaayi jaankaree simit hi he) hamaare samaaj, arthvyavastha, rahan-sahan, ravaie-rujhaanon or yahaan tak ki sex pravritiyon main badlaav kisi bhi samajashastreey adhyayan se zyada saaf-saaf najar aata he
 Movies seem to have captured the changes happening in small cities and towns much earlier than our sociologists and leaders
 aap kah sakate hai ki meraa sidhaa-sada, jaldi hi prabhavit ho jane vaala gaiyr-filmi dimag niraj ghevon kii bilashak dhansu film masaan dekhakar kuch zyada hi bahekane laga he, jisamen chote shaharon-kasbon kii dhadkan aise sunai detii he, jo maine kahin or dekhi nahin
 It has had a huge impact on me and i doubt that it will have the same effect on the minds of most viewers
 lekin isse vah rujhaan hi pakkaa hota he jise hamane shaad ali kii banty or bubbly main ubharate dekha tha or baad ke varshon main jise omkara, ishkia, lav sex or dhokhaa, dev di, gangs of vasepur or ab masaan main pukhta hote dekha gaya he
 Some of its milder looks have been seen in Shuddh Desi Romance, Ranjhana, Tanu Weds Manu and its sequels and box office hits Dabangg and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi
 isliye pichley ekaadh dashak main kasbaai bharat filmon main usee teji se namoodaar hua he, jaise bechaargi or naaraazgi vaale sattar ke dashak ke pehle tak filmon main gaanv haaavee rahete the, jab bollywood kii filmein mahanagaron or hameshaa jeetne vaale engri yangamain kii ore mud gai thim
 Let us look at this story of change from the perspective of political economics
 yah kahana surakshit he ki aaj kaa yah badlaav 2001 main dil chahta he main dikhe rujhaan kii taarkik parinti he
 This was the first hit in a decade after the economic reforms to openly demonstrate prosperity
 tab tak hindi filmon main us daur kii lokapriy raajnneeti hi najar aati thi, yani garibi kaa gungan hota or 'tata-birla' jaise amiron kii khilli udayi jaati or is sandesh par jor diya jaataa ki asli khushi, maryaada or naitikta to garibon kii hi thati he
 In Farhan Akhtar's film, all three characters were rich and vagabond
 ve lakadak kaaron kii sawari karte, shampen pite or unheen jaisi dhani unki garlfrends bhi thim
 Before that in an average Hindi film, one of them would have been the son of a widow, who would have been working in the house of one of the other two, who would go to her kitchen and say, Aunty, no one can make a better dish than you
 lekin yah film to itani bejhijak samruddhi kaa dikhaava kar rahi thi ki 1 sitambar, 2001 ke mere raajnneeti par aadhaarit rahane vaale stambh main ise jagah mil gai
 This means that the message of 'povertyism' (the post on which i can claim my trademark) has come out of the films that poverty is my birthright but you also have to adopt it
 uske baad ek dashak se zyada samay tak sarmaayedaaron yahaan tak ki enarai kirdaaron kaa cinema bhi lahraane laga
 Perhaps its height was seen in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara
 agar ab yah kahani kasbon kii ore bad rahi he to isse do baaten pataa chalati hai
 One, Hindi filmmakers have recognized the beat of change that we are calling some aspiring journalist, Akankshaya Bharat
 duusare, 1991 main shuru hui badlaav kii bayaar, jisane hamen sampatti kaa aadar karnaa or baad ke dashakon main apane udhyamon ko prem karnaa sikhaaya, ab aarthik sudhaaron ke pachchis saal baad, ris-riskar kasbon main or mote taur par usee raftaar se shahrati gaanvon main pahunch rahi he
 Without much discussion of the story, i want to mention my favorite scene in Masan
 devi pathak kaa kirdaar nibhaa raheen richaa chaddha banaras ke shmashaan ke ek daridr purohit kii behad tej or mahatvakankshi beti he
 She is the booking clerk at a railway station but suddenly one day is shocked to hear an urban young couple outside the ticket window saying that let's go somewhere and spend a night together
 phir, ve donon tikat maangate hai
 Devi's angry eyes look at the computer that 26 seats are empty but she tells them that there are no seats
 vah garib he par padhi-likhi he, kasbaai he par behad aakankshi he, vah jaanati he ki agar vah kisi boyfriend ke saath akele main kuch ghante bhi bitaa le to kisi afat tut padegi
 This may be an old story of most of Central India
 lekin ab vah ise kabool nahin karegi
 The boy and girl, who are more or less the same age, will not be given the happiness that they do not enjoy because of their place of residence
 iskaa saajha sandesh yahi he ki kasbon main logon ke rujhaan kitni teji se badal rahe hai
 Along with the mass communication revolution, education — be it from arre-garre engineering or management colleges — the media is bridging the gap between big and small cities and weakening caste and social boundaries, but the generational divide Is widening
 banaras ho yaa bareli, hoshangabad yaa hathras har jagah agar kisi ladke or ladki ke bich kishoravastha paar karne ke saath pehla sampark fasebuk par hota he to yah puri tarah pehle naam par aadhaarit hoga or ek-duusare ke 'friend request' ko maanane ke baad jab ishk shuru hota he to abhibhavakon or parivaaravaalon ke jati vagairah par vichaar karne tak der ho chuki hoti he
 From this, the increase in 'honor killing' can be understood
 yaa jab bisek saal kii ladki sex ke bare main aantiyon kii guftgu yaa kaanaafoosee se nahin, balki apane garib ghar main bhi computer par pornography ke jariye jaanegi to vah shaadi tak intjaar karne ke badale uskaa anubhav karnaa chaahegi
 And to go 'caught', i can just say softly to the questions of angry parents that i wanted to experience
 saste smart phone, motorcycle or nijee collejon kaa yah ghalmail puraane, 'paramparaagat' paariwarik rishton, mahatvakankshaon or sex ke nazariye ko puri tarah barbaad kar rahaa he
 We saw the first sign of this change in Anurag Kashyap's film Dev D, in which Mahi Gill takes a mat on his bicycle, so that where he can find solitude in the sugarcane field, in the villages of far away Punjab, Ishq is in love with Abhay Deol
 Could promise

 But this is the changed new Indian woman
 smart filmkaaron ne uski dhadkan pehle pakadi
 And now the audience is accepting it because it has the same image that they see in their families or neighborhood

 Now the city is not as far away as before and no one is willing to consider themselves as second-class from Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore

 bijepi ke baagi netaa congress kaa haath tham sakate hai
 Bihari Babu Shatrughan Sinha, who has been continuously questioning Narendra Modi's policies and bjp's suspended MP from Darbhanga and former cricketer Kirti Azad, is expected to make his fortune in the 2019 political battle with the Congress
 sutron kii maane to bijepi se naaraaz chal rahe shatrughna sinha aagaamee 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main dilli kii north east seat se congress ke tikat par lard sakate hai
 They are also in touch with Congress leaders to confirm their claim
 maujuuda samay main is seat se bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari saansad hai
 Bihari Babu is currently an MP from Patna Sahib Lok Sabha seat in Bihar
 shatrughna ke congress main shaamil hone or dilli kii north east seat se chunaav ladane par party netaa ise chunavi kayaas bataa rahe hai
 But there is no denying it clearly
 is seat par purvanchal ilaake ke matadaataaon kii acchhee khaasi aabaadi hai
 Recently, Shatrughan Sinha reached the rjd's Iftar party and gave clear indications that he can contest on the grand alliance ticket
 itnaa hi nahin unke vipakshi dal ke netaaon ke saath rishte bahut behatar hai
 In the grand alliance, the seat of Patna Sahib is in the account of the Congress anyway
 mana ja rahaa he ki shatrughna sinha congress ke tikat par chunaav ladenge
 However, he is also offered tickets by RJD
 dilli kii satta par kabiz aam aadmi party ke netaa or mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se unki nazdikiyaan kisi se chhipi nahin he
 Let me tell you that Kirti Azad has also given indications to contest elections on Congress ticket
 darbhanga main patrakaron se baatcheet karte hue unhone congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii jamkar tarif kii thi
 His wife Poonam Azad has already joined the Congress
 aise main unke congress main jane kii kaaphi sambhaavna hai
 Kirti Azad may be hinting at joining Congress, but the dilemma is that her RJD has been contesting from Darbhanga seat
 aise main vahaan se congress se tikat milanaa mushkil ho saktaa he
 Ashraf Fatmi has been an MP on RJD ticket and has also been a minister in the UPA government at the Center
 kirti aaazaad ne kaha tha ki bijepi ne jo paristhitiyaan banaai hai, aise main unke paas doosraa vikalp hi bachaa he
 Now he will contest from another party from Darbhanga and that option will be a national party
 congress main kirti ke jane ke sanket main dam tab or dekhne ko mila, jab kirti azaad ne rahul gandhi kii jamkar tarif karte hue kaha tha ki rahul ke kushal netritv main congress party kaaphi teji se aage bad rahi he
 There is also a lot of power inside Rahul Gandhi which is a danger bell for the ruling party (BJP)
 westeindies main bermuda ke liye khilne vaale olerounder kewon fubler ne out die jane par pehle stamps or phir ampire kii taraf phenki gend kar gussa nikaala jisaki vajah se usapar saat saal kaa pratibandh lag gaya
 Fubler had earlier said that if he was given out, he would vent his anger on the wicked, then he showed it by doing it
 ampire ne jab use 'leg bifor wicket' yani elbidbalu out diya to vaaqai kahe anusaar wicket par apana gussa nikaala
 But if the matter had ended here, it might not have been so big
 iske baad usne ampire ke saath badsuluki bhi kii
 The big thing in this whole sentence was that Fubler's anger continued till he left the field
 ho saktaa tha ki uske khilaaf itani kadi karrwai or ection naa liya gaya hota agar usne maidan chhodane ke baad ampire kii taraf jaanboojhkar gend naa phenki hoti
 The comments nateeja 7 saal kaa pratibandh Fubler's anger was overshadowed by his cricketing career as the player was found guilty of a Level 4 offense

 2011 main bhi fubler ko somerset cricket club se bain kar diya gaya tha jab unhone chayankarta moli simons ko apshabd kahe the kyonki unhen team main shaamil nahin kiya gaya tha
 Bermuda had previously banned wicketkeeper Jason Anderson for a lifetime as he had a fight last season with on-field bowler George o'brien
 is puure vaakye main badi baat ye rahi kii fubler kaa gussa maidan chhodane ke baad tak jari rahaa
 It would have been that such hard action and action against him would not have been taken had he not intentionally thrown the ball towards the umpire after leaving the field
 tippaniyan Result 7 year ban fubler kaa gussa uske cricket kariyar par baari pad gaya kyonki is khilaadi ko level 4 ofence kaa doshi paaya gaya

 Fubler was also banned from Somerset Cricket Club in 2011 after he abused selector Molly Simmons as he was not included in the squad

" 4 july ko aae aarthik survey ke anusaar, start-ap echosystem main bharat ko duniya main teesraa sthaan mila he
 The IT industry organization Nasscom estimates that over 1,200 tech start-ups start every year in India
 aise samay main jab sarkaar ne berogari ghataane ke liye bahut si koshishen kii hai (berogari dar 2017-18 main 6

, all aimed at promoting new ventures
 haalanki, teen saal biit chuke hai lekin ise dharaatal par utaara nahin ja sakaa

 In the later stages, when start-ups prove their business model and they start to grow in a big way, a large part of the fund comes from sources outside the country and thus the business is non-indian owned
 goes
 kai baar to aisa bhi hota he ki us safal start-ap kaa panjikrut karyaalay bhi bharat se baahar sthanantarit ho jaataa he

 Promotion in the budget: In the Union budget, efforts are being made to address the issues which are becoming a hindrance for this sector
 inamen se ek badi pareshaani tathakthith 'anjal tex' kii rahi he
 Under this, any investment in a start-up above the fair value fixed by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) was treated as income for that start-up and was eligible to be taxed
 angel tex kii shuruyaat 2012 main hui thi or aisa dekha gaya ki vibhaag iske liye pareshaan karne kii had tak kii atisakriyata dikhaata tha, vishesh rup se 2017 main aisa hua
 However, Sitharaman has decided to change this pattern
 unke anusaar, ''start-ap or unke niveshak jo aavashyak byore daakhil karte hai or apane ritern main isaki jaankaree pradaan karte hai, ve start-ap share premium ke moolyankan ke sambandh main kisi bhi prakaar kii chaanbin ke adheen nahin honge
 The issue of identification of investors and source of funds will be resolved through e-verification system
 unhone kaha ki isse start-aps apni jutai gai dhanrashi ko lekar iskar vibhaag kii kisi bhi tarah kii jaanch kii aavashyaktaa se alag honge
 In addition, special administrative arrangements will be made in CBDT for pending assessments and redressal of grievances

 '' disief main companiyon main nivesh kaa moolyankan bhavishya ke nakadi pravaah ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 However, investors also consider this effort a cumin-like thing in the camel's mouth
 gopalkrishnan kehete hai, ''inhen spashtikaran or dishanirdesh ke rup main jari kiya gaya he
 So, a lot will depend on how it is being interpreted, and how it will be implemented

" happened
 ''iskar adhinium kii dhara 56(2)(7bi) ke anusaar, praapt uphaaron ke liye praptakarta kar ke paatr hai
 Tax notices were being sent to start-ups under this section, asking them to pay taxes on the 'angel funds' they received
 ab, sarkaar ne spasht kiya he ki vah kisi bhi moolyankan report kii tab tak chaanbin nahin karegi, jab tak yah start-ap echosystem kaa panjikrut hissaa bana rahata he
 "this will help in new cases and is also a sign of strong intentions," says Gupta
 lekin sab kuch is par nirbhar karegaa ki ise lagu kaise kiya jaataa he
 "the Finance Minister has relaxed carry-over losses in the books of start-ups to carry forward (for next year) or the terms of its settlement
" unhone start-ap main nivesh ke liye ghar kii bikri se hone vaale puunjigat laabh main chhot kii avadhi bhi badhaai he
 This is expected to bring more relief in the initial years
 aise start-ap jinamein bharpoor sambhaavnaaen hoti hai, unamem shuru main baari nivesh hota he or is avadhi main ve koi laabh bhi nahin kamaate hai
 Deshpande says that reducing GST or giving subsidies to loss-making start-ups can help them a lot

 Tomorrow, the night of 30 June, a 17 year old dream is going to be fulfilled
 desh kaa sabase bada aarthik sudhaar guds and sarvice tex (jiesti) sansad main yojit ek bhavy samaaroh main launch hoga
 This is a major achievement for the central government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself
 jiesti ke jariye ek desh-ek tex kii jo vyavastha lagu hone ja rahi he usase bharat main vyapaar karnaa aasaan hoga, tex chori rukegi, kar prakriya aasaan hogi or sarkaar kaa rajasav badhegaa jisase jidipi main bhi growth dekhne ko milegi
 This is the reason why BJP is considering GST as a big weapon for the 2019 electoral battle
 lekin agar itihaas par najar daalen to ye bada daanv uske liye ulta bhi pad saktaa he
 Prime Minister Kim Campbell, the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Kamikanada in the government's popularity, had to face a crushing defeat in the 1993 national election as his government lost its popularity after the implementation of GST
 lagbhag 80 pratishat matadaataaon ne karadhaan kanoon ko khaarij kar diya tha jiske baad jin shiratin ke netritv main libral party ne sadan main ek majboot bahumat praapt kiya or canada kii agali sarkaar kaa gathan kiya
 In Australia, the John Howard government made a difficult comeback in elections in 1998, soon after the introduction of GST
 jiesti lagu karne vaale adhiktar deshon ko bahut zyada mahangaai kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In 1994, when Singapore introduced GST, inflation had increased significantly
 mahangaai badhanaa bada muddajisti lagu hone ke baad bharat main bhi mahangaai badhane kii ashanka zyada he
 If this happens then today people supporting BJP on GST can go against it tomorrow
 isse pehle congress ne jiesti ko latakaane kaa kaam kiya
 The result is that GST is now being implemented and it is believed that after its implementation, inflation will increase for the next two-three years
 yani jab 2019 ke chunaav ke liye vot daale ja rahe honge tab mahangaai se janata pareshaan hogi
 If this happens then BJP may have to pay its price in the election

 yadi jiesti se log naaraaz hue to in rajyon main bijepi ko apni satta kaayam rakhane main kaaphi mushkil hogi
 Anger of traders? The merchant class is considered a traditional voter of BJP
 ab jabaki jiesti lagu hone ja rahaa he to deshbhar main kai jagah vyapaaree gusse main hai
 In some places, traders have announced to close the business tomorrow
 vyapaariyon ko dar he ki nae kar dhaanche se unke liye mushkilen khadi hongi kyonki pehle kii tulana main takreeban teen guna tex ritern unhen bharne honge
 Apart from this, there are also billing issues on which they feel that they will not be able to save their current profit
 ye wo varg he jo pehle hi notebandi kii maar jhel rahaa he, ab jiesti ke jatke se wo bijepi ke khilaaf khadaa ho saktaa he
 Opportunity for Opposition: Three years have passed since the arrival of the government, but the Opposition has not been able to find any issue that can unite and put the government in the dock and in which people will also be supported

 iarsitisi pehle se hi 65 express trainon, 6 rajdhani, 13 duranto, 6 shatabdi or 2 suvidha gadiyon main cataring sevaayen pradaan karti he
 Out of these, IRCTC is catering itself to 29 trains and 63 are being served through licensees

 It was mentioned in the budget that Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu announced in the budget of 2016-17 that IRCTC will gradually be entrusted with catering services in all trains
 iske liye iarsitisi bhojan taiyaar karne or bhojan vitaran ke bich ke antar ko khatm karte hue cataring sevaaon kaa vistaar karegi
 The expansion will be announced soon, with plans to streamline the catering campaign by setting up base kitchens across the country and appointing separate agencies to prepare and distribute food
 iarsitisisbhi nai trainon or jald shuru kii jane vaali trainon main bhi cataring kaa prabandhan karegi or un trainon main bhi cataring kaa prabandhan karegi jinke maujuuda cataring theke samaapt ho gayi hai yaa khatm kar diye gayi hai
 Mayawati is such a person who brought Dalit politics to a point, made it in power
 aisa nahin he ki desh kii raajnneeti main unase pehle anusuchit jati kaa koi netaa satta kii seedhi na chadha ho, lekin mayawati isliye alag hai kyonki daliton kii raajnneeti karne vaale dal bahujan samaaj party kii netaa ke taur par uttar pradesh jaise mahatvapurn rajya kii chaar baar mukhyamantri baniin
 He was also counted among the prime ministerial candidates
 lekin 2012 ke vidhansabha or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main party ko mili kadi shikast ke baad party ko netritv ke str par nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 During this time, many strong leaders of the party left the party or Mayawati herself distanced herself from the young leaders emerging in the party
 swami prasad maurya or nasimuddin siddiqui, ye aise naam hai jo bahujan samaaj party main duusari qatari ke netaa maane jate the
 It is said that after Mayawati, Swami Prasad Maurya was in the party, but before the UP assembly elections, his path was separated from the BSP
 swami prasad maury ne bhartiya janata party kaa daaman tham liya
 After him Nasimuddin Siddiqui also broke away from the party and went to Congress
 nasimuddin aisi kadi ke rup jane jate the jo muslimon ko party se jodne kaa kaam karata tha
 In the BSP it is a silsil that continues
 uttar bharat ke hindi pattee main kanshiram ne dalit raajnneeti kaa aadhaar taiyaar kiya or bahujan samaaj party kaa gathan kiya
 Seeing the leadership potential and political prospects, he pushed Mayawati forward
 mayawati ne kadi mehnat or raajnneetik sooyeeboojh se basapa ko satta tak pahunchaaya
 Her own political strength is that whenever the prime ministerial contenders are discussed in the political corridors, Mayawati's name is also taken among them
 mayawati aaj apana 63waan janmdin manaa rahi hai or pehali baar unki party gathbandhan main chunaav ladane ja rahi he
 But the question is who after Mayawati? Who will be the one who will take their politics forward? She seems to be keeping distance from the party or other emerging Dalit youth faces
 jail se reeha hone ke baad mayawati ko lekar kiye gaye sawaal par bhim army ke adhyaksh chandrashekhar ne kaha tha ki, ‘vah mere parivaar kii sadsy hai
 My aunt is main unka bhatija hum
 We have a family relationship with them
 ’ chandrashekhar ke is bayaan par fouran ek din baad mayawati kaa bayaan aa gaya or unhone chandrashekhar ke bayanon ko sire se khaarij kar diya
 Mayawati issued a statement saying, 'some people are telling me in political selfishness some people in defense of their brother-sister or sometimes aunt-nephew relationship
 saharanpur cond main abhi- abhi reeha kiya gaya vyakti bhi mujhe apni buaa bataa rahaa he
 i have no relation with such people
 ’congress main shaamil hone se pehle basapa kii raay soshal media or televijan chailanon par rakhane vaale devashish jaraariya se bhi party ne duuri bana lee
 The BSP issued a statement dismissing Devashish Jararia's relationship with the party
 jari ek bayaan main basapa kii taraf se kaha gaya ki devashish jaraariya dwaara ‘bispi youth’ ke naam se farji or anaadhikrut rup se chalaae ja rahe sanghathan se basapa ke logon, khaastaur se yuvaaon ko saavdhaan rahane kii jarurat he
 'devashish Jararia was shocked by this and joined the Congress
 madhya pradesh se taalluk rakhane vaale devashish jaraariya ne aajtak
 Talking to in, 'mayawati's distance from young leaders is beyond comprehension
 unhone pichley dinon basapa ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh jai prakaash ko party se nikaal diya
 The youth leader who is active in the party is thrown out
 main soshal media ke jariye bahujan samaaj ke yuvaaon ko party se jodne kii muhim main juta hua tha, lekin yah unhen pasand nahin aayaa
 The BSP has suffered due to this
 'uttar pradesh ke 2012 or 2017 ke do vidhansabha chunaavon or phir loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main haar ke baad mayawati ke saath basapa ke astitv par sawaal uthne lage
 Mayawati, who formed a majority government by winning 206 seats in the 2007 assembly elections, was reduced to 80 seats in 2012
 2017 kii sthiti to or kharaab ho gai or basapa vidhansabha kii maatr 19 siten hi jeet pai
 Despite securing a respectable vote share of 4 per cent in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BSP could not convert it into winning seats
 devashish jaraariya daawa karte hai, ‘yuvaaon or soshal media se duuri kaa basapa ko nuksaan hua
 Four BSP mlas won in Madhya Pradesh in the 2013 assembly elections, but in 2018 the number came down to 2
 2013 ke chunaav main muraina main basapa ko 31 fisadi vot mili the, lekin 2018 main yah ghatakar 19 fisadi par pahunch gaya
 For this, he alleged that the party had to bear the brunt of bypassing the youth activists in Madhya Pradesh
 vah kehete hai, ‘nae dalit chehron ko vah chunauti maanati hai, isliye vah unase duuri banaakar rakhti hai chahen vah chandrashekhar aaazaad hon, jignesh mevani hon
 ' kendriya vitt or corporate maamalon kii mantri nirmala sitaraman ne guuruuvaar ko aarthik samiksha 2018-19 sansad main pesh kii
 a special point has been said in this that the private sector invests only where it sees profit
 aise main sarkaar ko isamen hastkshep karnaa chahie or un kshetron kaa bhi data ikattha karnaa chahie jahaan privet sector ne nivesh nahin kiya he
 So that it can be used for the upliftment and well being of the poor
 aarthik samiksha main bataaya gaya he ki sarkaron ke paas pehle se hi nagarikon ke prashasnic, surveykshan, sansthagat or tranjection kaa data maujuud he lekin iskaa istemaal sahi tareeke se nahin ho paaya he
 This information is present in various government bodies
 aise main sarkaar in data ke aadhaar par uchit nitiyaan bana sakati he
 Through these policies and plans, welfare schemes can be made for the poor people and their standard of living can be improved
 nijee kshetra ko jahaan dikhaa laabh, vahiin kiya niveshprivet sector ne ab tak vahiin nivesh kiya he jahaan unhen laabh hota he
 In such a situation, the government now needs to invest in social sectors where the data has not been collected yet
 haalanki pichley kuch saalon main data kaa upyog bhi badha he
 The global data infrastructure is reliable, fast and secure
 aise main bharat main bhi ise bade paimaane par ikattha karne kii jarurat he
 Earlier, many problems were faced in collecting data, but now the task of data collection has become easier
 ab iske liye unnat praudyogiki maujuud he
 For this reason, data can be collected at low cost
 niztaa kanoon ke daayre main nagarikon kaa data ekatra karne kii jaruratdata jamaa karne ke dauraan hameshaa yah sawaal uthta rahaa he ki kahin isamen niztaa ke kanoon ulanghan to nahin hota
 Therefore, the complexity of privacy should be taken into account when collecting data
 aarthik samiksha main kaha he ki paardarshita baratate hue bhi ise hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 There is now a lot of facility for collecting, storing, processing and expanding data at minimum cost
 aarthik samiksha main kaha gaya he ki vibhinn mantralayon main bikhare pade databes ko ek jagah ekatrit karke nagarikon ko behatar sevaaon kaa anubhav karaayaa ja saktaa he, yani sarkaar iske jariye apane nagarikon ko behatar seva muhaiyaa kara sakati he
 This will also reduce the possibility of error in welfare schemes
 aarthik samiksha main kaha gaya he ki vibhinn kshetron main ekatrit data kaa ab tak istemaal nahin ho paaya he
 The government should ensure the use of socially necessary data
 sarkaar ko is kshetra main kadam uthaane kii jarurat he
 The review states that data should be collected by the people, for the people
 is dauraan is baat kaa khyaal rakhaa janaa chahie ki amir logon kii niztaa kii praathamikta garibon par na thopi jaae
 The review says that India is revolutionizing the data and technology front through Aadhaar
 data ke mahatv ko rashtriya rajmargon ke mahatv ke saamaan hi samajha janaa chahie
 Also, under the spirit of the Constitution, data should be of the people, by the people, for the people

 gaanv or parivaar waalon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar khaali baaten kar rahi he, magar pakistan ke khilaaf koi ection nahin leti
 People are against Pakistan and are demanding that action should be taken against Pakistan

 arpit agarwal iity-jeii 2012 ke topper hai
 The Faridabad student has considered the MVN school as well as the contribution of the coaching institute Fitji to his success where he used to go to study two days a week

 Aggarwal also believes that private coaching of his son was necessary for success as the pattern of examinations of CBSE and IIT-JEE are different

 Competition is so high that coaching for children becomes necessary for proper guidance
 '' arpit ko sibiesai pariksha main 96
 5 per cent and 98 per cent marks were found in PCM group
 isi tarah iity-jeii main duusare sthaan par rahe bijoy kochar ne bhi chandigarh main koching kii madad se safalataa hasil kii he

 It is clear that not only engineering, medical, management, UPSC and banking will also provide many examples of success due to coaching in many competitive exams

 Hailing from Lilong, 39 km from Imphal, the capital of Manipur, Mohammad Ismat secured 99 per cent marks in class 12 of CBSE and topped the country

 in taaja misaalon ko dekhne ke baad sawaal uthta he ki koching jaruri he yaa nahin
 "coaching is helpful but, to be honest, for talented students," says Pramod Maheshwari, chairman and managing director of Career Point, an 18-year-old coaching institute in Kota, the IIT graduate and the country's first successful IPO in the coaching business
 Coaching is not necessary
 isaki jarurat ausat or isse kuch behatar chaatro ko zyada rahati he
 "apart from the talent of the students, studies in many government and private schools do not ensure success in competitive examinations or entrance examinations
 aise main koi bhi abhibhavak jokhim nahin uthaanaa chahta
 In September 2011, a report by industry body Assocham on coaching institutes spread across the country revealed that 70 percent of parents want to provide coaching to their children
 asocham ne dilli, mumbai, kolkata or bangaloru samet aath shaharon main 800 pariwaron kaa survey kiya

 According to Trikha, "if schools do their job well then there will be no need for coaching centers
 chaatr khud apane jaj hai or ve hi apni jarurat ke mutabik koching centre ke chayan kaa faisla karte hai
 In fact, along with schooling, the trend of coaching has increased
 aaj kii bhaagambhag vaali jindagi main pravesh parikshaon main kadi pratispardhaa ke bich koching kii ahmiyat bad rahi he
 Parents depend on private tuition or coaching institutes in addition to school to teach their children, where children resort to coaching from school homework to clear concepts and continuous practice
 lekin koching kaarobaar kaa bada hissaa betaratib dhang se badha he or is par sawalia nishaan bhi lage hai
 Last week itself, changes have been announced in the admission process of the country's top engineering institutes run by the central government

 There will be one question paper for the last two tests, whose exam will be taken on the same day

 Barring Indian Institutes of Technology (iits), the centrally aided institutions such as Triple IT and NIT have 40 percent to give 12th board result, JEE Main test result 30 percent and JEE Advanced test result 30 Percentage will be given importance
 tripal ity or enity kaa anubhav thik najar aane par 40+30+30 kaa yah formula iity 2015 se apnaane ke liye sahamat hue hai
 But after the announcement of Sibal there has been a mixed reaction in the coaching industry and academia
 maheshwari kaa kahana he ki sarkaar kii manshaa acchhee he, lekin asal uddeshyon ko paane kaa tarika kargar nahin he
 In practical terms, students will become more stressed instead of being stress free
 board pariksha bhi kadi pratispardhaa ke daayre main aa gai he
 Parents will also not spend less
 iity graduate or gupta tutorils, indore ke siio sandip gupta kaa kahana he, ''isse koching ko gorakhdhandha bana chuke sansthaanon par lagaam lagegi
 On the other hand, schools will also have to prove their ability
 aage chal kar aisa prayog medical or management jaise duusare kshetron main bhi ho saktaa he
 "there are many doubts about the new system
" isse keval chaatro par dabaav hi badhegaa
 There will be psychological pressure on students to have both JEE Main and JEE Advanced papers in one day
 udhar, 12veen ke ankon ko jodna uttar pradesh or bihar sahit kai jagahon ke chaatro ke liye zyada chunauteepurn hoga kyonki sibiesai or isiesai board kii tulana main rajya bordon ke chaatro ke ankon main baari antar hota he
 There are rules for giving different board numbers
 haalanki 12veen ke ankon ko kis tarah ahmiyat di jaaegi, iskaa tarika philhal spasht nahin he
 It is also being said that if the new system were implemented from 2014, students would have got enough time to prepare for this change
 haalanki jeares tutorils, varanasi ke nideshak e
 K
 jha kaa kahana he, ''chaatro ko nae pattern se ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin he
 Given the weightage of the board, they will have to prepare for English and optional subjects from the beginning
 ''trikha maanate hai ki nae pattern ke chaatro ke liye phaayde or nuksaan, donon hai
 According to him, the 12th examination is a basic fort and it must be strong, but the question is how can all the different examinations be classified under one examination? How will the ability of students to be fully assessed and how will the standard of engineering exam for different courses be different and higher? Actually, it is not difficult for the meritorious students to face any kind of problem, but apart from this, other students have to face their mother Systematic guidance is needed to fulfill the father's hopes or fulfill his dreams
 apana lakshya hasil karne ke liye ve ek sahi thikaane kii talash main honge jahaan ek hi chat ke neeche saare samaadhaan mil saken
 Most of the government and private schools are unable to help the students more in the competitive exams
 isi vajah se jagah-jagah privet tution yaa koching santhaan khul gaye hai
 If the schools cannot fulfill their responsibilities properly or win the trust of the students to get success in JEE, then more reliance on coaching will definitely increase instead of reducing their numbers in the 12th
 phir jeii main or jeii advanced kii taiyaari kerani hogi or gramin kshetron main, jahaan schuli shiksha behatar nahin hoti, vahaan ke bacchon ke liye chunautiyaan bad jaaengi
 In fact, these rules related to the new exam pattern have come up as a new business opportunity for coaching institutes providing tuition for admission in central engineering institutes
 koching santhaan iskaa phayda uthaane kii taiyaari main jute gaye hai
 Experienced operators of the coaching industry believe that many institutes of organized sector used to prepare students for the 12th board examination in mind
 haalanki padhaane kaa pattern jarur badalanaa hoga, study material main bhi badlaav hoga or faikalti ke chayan par bhi badali jaruraton ke mutabik focus hoga, lekin yah achche institute ke liye koi bada masalaa nahin he
 Actually, coaching institutes are not only ready to deal with the new pattern, but some institutes have increased their fees due to the need of additional material
 dekha yah gaya he ki pratiyogi parikshaon ke parinaam aate hi koching sansthaanon ke vigyapanon kii bharmaar lag jaati he
 But choosing the right coaching institute is a great job for parents
 vigyapanon main dheron safal chaatro kii tasviren chhapakar yah jataane kii koshish kii jaati he ki safalataa kaa nuskhaa in koching sansthaaon ke paas hi he
 Gupta says, "just a few years ago how open coaching institutes claim their top rankings of 70 to 100 students?" In fact, a huge industry of coaching has emerged for the success of competitive exams, Which has organized and unorganized sector institutions
 maheshwari kaa kaa kahana he, ''upabhokta kii tarah chaatro ko koching santhaan kaa chunaav karnaa chahie
 If you are paying fees, then also see if their problems are being resolved
 yadi nahin to us koching ko chhod den
 According to Maheshwari, the relationship between teacher and student has become professional
 yah vailu system main aayaa badlaav he
 Improving the level of service in organized sector coaching institutes is a positive change
 chaatr us koching santhaan ko chune jahaan unhen personal care mili
 They should have the freedom to speak to get their problems resolved
 yah dekhnaa chahie ki ve aasaani se santhaan ke management se mil pate hai yaa nahin
 Students should avoid institutes whose foundation is laid by unsuccessful candidates for competitive exams and who open coaching institutes to get rid of their unemployment
 koching santhaan chunate samay chaatr or unke abhibhavak akasar apane parichiton yaa rishtedaaron ke paraamarsh ko tarjeeh dete hai lekin koching santhaan chunate samay uskaa trek record, chaatro kii safalataa kaa pratishat, faikalti kaa str aadi ke bare main jaankaree juta leni chahie
 The quality of education imparted in a coaching institute means that how much promise she is coaching, how much she is fulfilling, because this is the factor, which will prove beneficial for you as well
 in sabko samajhane ke liye koching santhaan main padhaayaa jane vaala material kya he, padhaane kaa tarika kitna prabhavi he, faikalti kisi he aadi mahatvapurn baton ke bare main jaananaa chahie
 In order to verify the claims of the coaching institutes website, it is beneficial to know the successful students from their origin
 us santhaan ko chunane main hi samajhdaari he jo chaatro ko skool ke saath samay ke maamle main talmail baitaane main madad karne ko taiyaar rahete hai
 The study material, handaction papers and online facilities provided by the coaching institute are very important
 ejineering, medical yaa management kii kisi bhi pravesh pariksha kii taiyaari 10veen kii pariksha ke baad hi shuru ho jaati he
 But Jha says that classes 9th and 10th are important to strengthen the foundation
 chaatro ko in donon kakshaon main har vishay ke adhyay kii ek-ek line ko dhyaan se padhanaa chahie, iske baad adhyay ke peeche ke sabhi prashn khud hal karne kii puri koshish karen
 Students should not rely on tuition
 chaatr agar khud mehnat karke sikhta he to uske fundamentals clear ho jate hai
 Even if students go for tuition or coaching for some reason, then the teacher's way of teaching should be such that they should get the student to do most of the work
 mahaj suchanaaen yaa redimaid jaankariyaan dekar chaatro kaa kaam aasaan bananaa teacher kaa kaam nahin he
 Basic concepts of students need to be well maintained
 maheshwari maanate hai ki chaatr kii safalataa main koching class ke saath hi mata-pita kaa bhi yogadan rahata he
 Parents should not compare the child with anyone
 saath hi bachche par dabaav daalane kii jagah use relaxd rakhen or bachche kaa utsaah badhaate rahen
 You should increase the confidence of your children by saying that if there is no selection in an entrance examination, then it is not a problem, there are plenty of other options for them
 bhabha classes, kanpur ke nideshak mahesh singh chouhan maanate hai ki asaadhaaran pratibha ke dhani kuch hi bachche hote hai baaki zyaadaatar koching ke jariye apana lakshya paanaa chaahate hai
 Coaching institutes that are changing rapidly with time will continue to fulfill the dreams of students

 Let us tell you that in the 1993 bomb attack on the Youth Congress office, nine people were killed

 On 12 April, the plea of navneet Kaur, wife of Devender Pal Singh Bhullar, was rejected by the Supreme Court in which she appealed that her sentence be commuted to life imprisonment due to the delay in hanging
 bataa den ki 1993 main yuvak congress karyaalay par hue bam hamale main nau log maare gaye the

 kingfisher airlines ke maalik vijay maalya 2 march ko hi desh chhod chuke hai, jab bainkon ne is maamle ko lekar yachika daakhil kii thi
 The Attorney General made this disclosure when asked by the Supreme Court
 haalanki supreme court ne maalya ko notice jari kar 2 hafte main jawaab maanga he or kaha he ki kyon naa unka passport jabt kar liya jaae
 During the hearing, Mukul Rohatgi said in the court that we have spoken to the CBI, it has been learned that Mallya has left the country on March 2, when the banks petitioned the DRT
 AG ne kaha ki ye janata kaa paisa he, ham ye paisa waapas chaahate hai, hamen kisi kaa khun nahin chahie
 The court may ask Mallya to appear
 hamen yah bhi pataa he ki maalya ke paas videshon main karodon rupee kii sampatti he, jo hamaare lone se kahin zyada he, haalanki supreme court ne bainkon se sawaal poocha ki jab aap dasvaan hissaa hi ricover kar paaen to itnaa lone kyon diya gaya? court ne kaha ki philhal vah maalya ko notice jari kar rahe hai
 The matter will be heard on 30 March
 tippaniyan In fact, the Supreme Court is hearing a petition by 17 banks, including the State Bank of India, seeking to stop the bankrupt Kingfisher Airlines owner and industrialist Vijay Mallya from moving out of the country
 supreme court main 17 bainkon kii or se yachika daayar kar kaha gaya he ki udyogpati vijay maalya ne state bank of india sahit 17 bainkon se lagbhag 9000 karod rupaya rin liya hua he, jo chukaaya nahin gaya he
 Mallya wants to settle in London instead of paying this money
 isse unka rupaya doobane kaa dar he isliye vijay maalya kaa passport jabt kar desh se baahar jane par roak lagaai jaae
 The petition states that Mallya should deposit the bail amount to appear in the Debt Recovery Tribunal, or DRT, and the DRT completes the hearing soon
 sunwaayee ke dauraan court main mukul rohtagi ne kaha ki hamaari sibiai se baat hui he, jaankaree mili he ki maalya 2 march ko desh chhod chuke hai, jab bainkon ne diarti main yachika di thi
 The AG said that this is the money of the public, we want this money back, we do not want anyone's blood
 court maalya ko pesh hone ke liye kah saktaa he
 We also know that Mallya has assets worth crores of rupees abroad, which is more than our loan, however, the Supreme Court asked the banks the question, why was such a loan given when you can recover only one-tenth? The court said that at the moment he is issuing notice to Mallya
 is maamle kii sunwaayee 30 march ko hogi
 The comments darasal, diwalia ho chuki kingfisher airlines company ke maalik or udyogpati vijay maalya ko desh se baahar jane se rokane kii maang ko lekar state bank of india sahit 17 bainko kii yachika par supreme court sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 a petition has been filed by 17 banks in the Supreme Court that industrialist Vijay Mallya has taken a loan of about 9000 crore rupees from 17 banks including State Bank of India, which has not been repaid
 maalya yah rupaya dene ke bajaay landan jaakar settle hona chaahate hai
 Due to this, their fear of sinking rupee is why, confiscate the passport of Vijay Mallya and prevent him from going out of the country
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki maalya debt recovery tribunel yani DRT main pesh hone ke liye jamaanat raashi jamaa karaaen or DRT jald is maamle kii sunwaayee puri kare
 The court may ask Mallya to appear
 hamen yah bhi pataa he ki maalya ke paas videshon main karodon rupee kii sampatti he, jo hamaare lone se kahin zyada he, haalanki supreme court ne bainkon se sawaal poocha ki jab aap dasvaan hissaa hi ricover kar paaen to itnaa lone kyon diya gaya? court ne kaha ki philhal vah maalya ko notice jari kar rahe hai

 China on Thursday did what no country in the world could do
 chand kaa wo hissaa jo prithvi se kabhi dikhataa hi nahin he, us hisse par china ne apana apana spescraft chang-4 utaar diya
 This step is considered as a big revolution in the field of space
 chand ke is hisse ko dark said kaha jaataa he, jo prithvi se dekha nahin ja saktaa he
 China's news agency Xinhua confirmed that the China National Space Administration announced that the spacecraft with a lander and a rover at 10 in the morning
 26 baje (beijing samaynusaar) 177
 6 degrees east longitude and 45
 5 degree dakshin akshansh main chand ke andekhee hisse main utraa he
 This is the same part of the moon which is never seen from the earth
 aapako bataa den ki prithvi se chand kaa sirf ek hi hissaa najar aata he
 The reason for this is that while the moon is orbiting the earth, it is also rotating on its axis
 yahi kaaran he ki chand kaa doosraa hissaa kabhi prithvi ke saamne aa hi nahin paata he
 China had been engaged in this mission for a long time, now its mission could be completed

 Significantly, India may soon launch its second important mission, Chandrayaan 2
 jisapar duniyabar kii najar he
 The specialty of our profession is that every day you keep hitting on stories with nothing happening and nothing happening
 yahi ve kisse hai, jo aapako is peshey main hone kaa ahsaas karaate rahete hai
 Today got a chance to go to a school in Delhi which has a history of its own
 ab itihaas he to uske apane antarvirodh bhi honge, magar ramajas foundation ke 16 skulon main se ek ramajas senior secondry bwys skool number 4 gaya tha
 This school is located on Chitragupta Road near RK Ashram of Karol Bagh
 gaya to kisi or kaam se tha, jiskaa zikr yahaan karnaa mahatvapurn nahin he, lekin jo kissa mil gaya, use aapse saajha karnaa chahta hum
 This school is non-government, but runs with government assistance
 dilli sarkaar ke paas sarkari or sarkari sahaayta praapt do prakaar ke skool hai
 Corporations and private schools have separate categories
 sarkari anudaan par chalane ke kaaran yahaan padhane vaale sabhi hazaar bachche muft shiksha pate hai
 The government provides more than 90 per cent of the teachers' salary and the rest is arranged by the trust of the school
 trust kii apni dikkatein hoti hai, kyonki skool daawa karata he ki vah na to kisi admician ke liye donneton letaa he na daan
 It is important to know that only then you will understand why the story i am narrating is important
 dilli main ramajas foundation sau saal se shiksha ke kshetra main kaam kar rahaa he
 Sixteen schools run including Ramjas College
 in dinon paryaavaran kii khub charchaa hoti he
 Eco clubs run in all private and government schools
 magar jab bhi yah mudda saarvajanik manchon par aata he, usamen privet skool hi hissedaar nazar aate hai
 Government schools are nowhere to be seen
 ho saktaa he ki ham media vaale bhi dekhne nahin jate honge ki kisi sarkari skool main kya hota he
 The Vice Principal of Ramjas School said that he has started a plan regarding the eco-club
 skool ke sabhi chaatro se kaha gaya ki aap apane ghar or pados se pradooshan certificate kii photocopy or uskaa number laaiye
 Each student was asked to bring three photocopies
 abhibhavakon ko jhunjhalaahat bhi hui ki unke paas gaadi nahin he, to kahaan se certificate kii copy laaen
 Nevertheless, four to five hundred students were able to get a copy of the certificate and number
 skool ne kaha ki har certificate kii antim tithi se kuch din pehle padosi yaa apane ghar ke logon ko yaad dilaanaa he ki nayaa certificate lene kaa time aa gaya he
 We all forget
 zyaadaatar log certificate kii taarikh nikal jane ke baad bhi gaadi chalaate rahete hai
 Suddenly it is noticed that if you do not take a new certificate, you may have to pay a fine
 skool ne bacchon se kaha ki iske liye aap skool ke phone kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 The Vice Principal said that we are thinking to implement this idea in a better way
 agar sabhi bachche lekar aaenge, to hamaare paas teen hazaar certificate kaa data jamaa ho jayega
 The school has told the students that this work number will be added in the subject of additional activities
 vaais principal ne bataaya ki hamaare bachche sabhi garib parivaar se aate hai
 It is not easy to use the phone for this purpose
 isliye unhen kaha gaya he ki ve zubaani apane papa yaa padosi ko yaad dilaa den ki kuch hi dinon main pradooshan kaa certificate amaanya hone vaala he
 Get a new one
 acchhee baat he ki kisi ne iske bare main sochaa or schuli bacchon ko paryaavaran ke masale par sakriy bhagidaari kaa mauka diya
 How will these children become responsible for pollution and environment while doing this work
 tippaniyan How good it is that the Delhi government or the local MP or MLA would put a government phone in the school with their funds, which the school does not have to bear the expenses
 bachche us muft ke phone se logon ko yaad dilaate rahen ki aapaki gaadi kii pradooshan jaanch kaa samay aa gaya he
 Sometimes good ideas die because of resources and encouragement
 vaais principal bhi mere utsaah se utsahit ho gaye or kehane lage ki ise or behatar tareeke se karenge
 i also started suggesting that a batch of students be made and that every batch should be given a class time in a week in which to do these things
 isse unke bheetar naagarik bodh kaa jabardast vikaas hoga
 i do not know how practical my suggestion is but under the influence of a good work i could not stop myself from speaking
 jo bhi ho ek idia kaa janm ho chukaa he
 That too in a school whose children are the most victims of environment and pollution
 shahar main pani kaa str neeche girtaa he to garibon ko pani kam miltaa he
 They have to queue for hours for water
 hawa karaab hoti he to beemaari unhen pehle pakadati he or aarthik dabaav kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 It may be possible that this work can also be done on a large scale
 dilli ke saare bachche phone par baithkar hamen pradooshan certificate kii taarikh hi yaad nahin dilaayenge balki hamen zimmedaar bhi bana sakate hai
 Every school will have a good call center
 aise hi anek skulon main kuch na kuch nayaa ho rahaa hoga

 We might not even go to the media to see what happens in a government school
 ramajas skool ke vaais principal ne bataaya ki unhone iko-club ko lekar ek yojana shuru kii he
 All the students of the school were asked to bring a photocopy of the pollution certificate and its number from your home and neighborhood
 har chaatr ko teen-teen photocopy laane ke liye kaha gaya
 Parents also got annoyed that they do not have a car, so where to get a copy of the certificate
 phir bhi chaar-paanch sau chaatr certificate kii copy or number laane main safal rahe
 The school said that a few days before the last date of every certificate, remind the neighbor or people of your home that the time has come to get a new certificate
 ham sab bhul jate hai
 Most people continue to drive even after the certificate date is over
 achaanak dhyaan aata he ki nayaa certificate nahin liya, to jurmaana bharna pad saktaa he
 The school told the children that you can use the school phone for this
 vaais principal ne kaha ki ham soch rahe hai ki is idia ko or behatar tareeke se lagu karen
 If all the children bring, then the data of three thousand certificates will be deposited with us
 skool ne chaatro se kaha he ki is kaam kaa number atirikt gatividhiyon ke vishay main joda jayega
 The Vice Principal told that our children all come from poor families
 is kaam ke liye phone kaa istemaal karnaa aasaan nahin he
 Therefore they have been asked to remind their father or neighbor that the pollution certificate is going to be invalid within a few days
 nayaa le len
 It is good that someone thought about it and gave school children an opportunity to participate actively on environmental issues
 is kaam ko karte hue ye bachche pradooshan or paryaavaran ko lekar kitne zimmedaar ho jaaenge
 The comments kitna acha hota ki dilli sarkaar yaa ilaake ke saansad yaa vidhayak apane fund se skool main ek sarkari phone laga dete, jiskaa kharchaa skool ko na uthaanaa pade
 Children keep reminding people with that free phone that the time has come to check your car's pollution
 kai baar achche vichaar sansaadhan or protsaahan ke kaaran dam tod dete hai
 The Vice Principal also got excited with my enthusiasm and started saying that we will do it better
 main bhi suzav dene laga ki chaatro kaa batch bana diya jaae or har batch ko hafte main ek class kaa vakt diya jaae, jisamen ye kaam karen
 This will lead to tremendous development of civic sense within them
 mujhe nahin maaloom ki meraa suzav kitna vyaavhaarik he lekin ek achche kaam ke asar main main bolne se khud ko nahin roak paaya
 However, an idea has been born
 wo bhi ek aise skool main jiske bachche paryaavaran or pradooshan ke sabase zyada shikaar hai
 If the water level in the city falls below, the poor get less water
 unhen pani ke liye ghanton line main laganaa padataa he
 When the air is bad, the disease catches them first and they have to face financial pressure
 ho saktaa he ki yah kaam bade paimaane par bhi sambhav ho sake
 All the children of Delhi will sit on the phone and not only remind us the date of the pollution certificate, but can also make us responsible
 har skool main ek acha khaasaa kol centre ban jayega
 There must be something new happening in many similar schools

 vaais principal ne bataaya ki hamaare bachche sabhi garib parivaar se aate hai
 It is not easy to use the phone for this purpose
 isliye unhen kaha gaya he ki ve zubaani apane papa yaa padosi ko yaad dilaa den ki kuch hi dinon main pradooshan kaa certificate amaanya hone vaala he
 Get a new one
 acchhee baat he ki kisi ne iske bare main sochaa or schuli bacchon ko paryaavaran ke masale par sakriy bhagidaari kaa mauka diya
 How will these children become responsible for pollution and environment while doing this work
 tippaniyan How good it is that the Delhi government or the local MP or MLA would put a government phone in the school with their funds, which the school does not have to bear the expenses
 bachche us muft ke phone se logon ko yaad dilaate rahen ki aapaki gaadi kii pradooshan jaanch kaa samay aa gaya he
 Many times they die due to good resources and encouragement
 vaais principal bhi mere utsaah se utsahit ho gaye or kehane lage ki ise or behatar tareeke se karenge
 i also started suggesting that a batch of students be made and that every batch should be given a class time in a week in which to do these things
 isse unke bheetar naagarik bodh kaa jabardast vikaas hoga
 i do not know how practical my suggestion is but under the influence of a good work i could not stop myself from speaking
 jo bhi ho ek idia kaa janm ho chukaa he
 That too in a school whose children are the most victims of environment and pollution
 shahar main pani kaa str neeche girtaa he to garibon ko pani kam miltaa he
 They have to queue for hours for water
 hawa karaab hoti he to beemaari unhen pehle pakadati he or aarthik dabaav kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 It may be possible that this work can also be done on a large scale
 dilli ke saare bachche phone par baithkar hamen pradooshan certificate kii taarikh hi yaad nahin dilaayenge balki hamen zimmedaar bhi bana sakate hai
 Every school will have a good call center

 Challenges in today's world
 in chaptars kii shuruyaat abhinav bindra, emil jatopek, tiger woods, micel oven, azim premaji, je ke rouling, charles darwin, richard branson jaise safal logon ke preranadayak kathanon se kii gai he
 Excerpts from the book: To win today means finding the right balance between being encouraging and being ruthless
 anya kshetron kii tulana main khelon main jeetne se na sirf un logon ko khushi hasil hoti he jo khelte hai, balki ham jaise logon ko bhi jo khelon ke shaukeen hote hai
 We enjoy this victory even after much time and talk
 - vijeta tiimon ke lakshanh prasann, shant ladakon ke jhund kaa maahaul, gend ko aage badhaane kii yogyata, vartmaan main jeena, bhavishya kii yojana bananaa, sabko saath lekar chalanaa, kam pradarshan karne waalon ko protsaahit karnaa, ravaiya ‘kar sakate hai’ vaala, mukaable par focus hona, bhukh, junun or urja
 - Goals can be out of reach but not out of sight
 aap apane liye jo lakshya nirdhaarit karte hai vahiin duniya ko bataata he ki aap kis kism ke insaan hai
 Preparing for a goal is as important as scoring a goal
 bhoomika or lakshya kii spashtataa jeetne ke liye mahatvapurn he
 - Triumph of victory - Ability, attitude and passion
 ek sust khilaadi or ek chust khilaadi ke bich fark ravaiya he
 Winning is not a destination but a series of floors in which new challenges are faced, and they dominate
 ham borg, sampraas or federer, tendulkar or worne, niklos or woods, pele or maradona, jordan or ali ko yaad karte hai jinhone jeetne ko aadat bana liya
 - Great players have incredible talent, but they are not necessarily the only qualification
 sahi ravaiye ke bina ek pratibhashali vyakti lambii avadhi kaa sthaayee vijeta nahin ho saktaa
 Once, Sachin was spending hours practicing to play Shane Warne's round the wicket leg break ball and when Warne did not bowl him the same in practice matches, he became even more cautious that Warne got him this ball in a Test match Will pour and it happened the same way
 jab test match main worne ne unhen vah gend daali to sachin ne use sidhe mid-wicket ke upar se nikaal diya sari duniya unki pratibha kii daad dene lagi
 It was not just talent but patience
 bagaiyr prayaas yogyata vyarth ho jaati he
 The recipe for success is - one tablespoon of talent but several big spoons of attitude and devotion
 sachin ke dost kambli main bhi bharpoor pratibha thi lekin antarrashtriya str par aane ke baad wo anushaasan nahin dikhaa sake
 The result is in front of everyone
 - safalataa kaa vishleshan bhi usee gahanta se karnaa chahie jitani asafalataa kaa kiya jaataa he
 Victory comes with side-effects: arrogance, overconfidence and complacency
 'main' kaa rog 'ham' kii paraajay kii ore le ja saktaa he
 Difficult conditions prove the champion to be different from the challengers
 - haarane ke lakshanh der se liya gaya faisla, ahankaar, aantarik pratispardhaa, gutbaji, kaam puraa karne se adhik mahatv shrey paane ko dena, focus main abhaav, urja main kami, byaap yojanaon kaa na hona, asafalataa ke liye dusron par aarope lagaana, vichaaron kaa na hona
 - Some people are natural leaders
 ek vicitra baat dekhi gai he ki adhikansh safal khilaadi, akasar, bahut prabhaavshaalee captain nahin rahe- jabaki mike brairali jaise ek safal captain yaa jon buchanan jaise coach is kaam ke liye bamushkil sabase zyada yogya prathit hote the
 - Leadership is often complicated
 winston churchill, jinhen duusare vishwayuddh ke daur ke behtareen netaaon main se ek ke rup main yaad kiya jaataa he, yuddh kii samaapti ke turant baad hue chunaav haar gaye the
 Those who proved to be great leaders during the war were ruled out as peaceable managers! - The job of the captain or coach is to provide a good atmosphere to the team's players, which encourages trust and cooperation
 - 2002 main nasir hossain ke netritv main bharat ai english team sachin ko out karne main naakaam rahane par unhen leg stamps ke baahar gend phenkakar hataash kiya or shatak se vanchit kiya
 The bowler was Ashley Giles
 jailes ke liye bhi yah ubaau kaam tha lekin captain ne unhen iskaa arth samajhaayaa ki tendulkar ko shatak banane dene kii apeksha yah vikalp behatar tha! yani agar koi khilaadi apni bhoomika ko jaanata he or ise bakhubi lagu karata he, to ek choti prathit hone vaali bhoomika bhi mahatvapurn ban sakati he
 - Leaders also have an end date
 ian chapel kaa maananaa he ki aap main ek aantarik aawaaj hoti he jo aapako bataa detii he ki kab jane kaa vakt aa gaya he
 But there is no formula to ensure the last date
 ganguli paanch saal tak captain rahe jabaki dravid ko laga ki unka samay do saal main hi puraa ho gaya he
 Therefore, employers should keep an eye and like players it is necessary to select and remove the leaders at the right time
 - acha leader vahi he jo durandesh ho, prerit karne ke liye samvaad karata ho, maahaul ko prabandhit karata ho, bharosemand, sammanit ho, team kaa saath detaa ho, aasaan pahunch main ho, khulaa, lacheela, eemaandaar or sunne ko taiyaar ho, sakaaratmak, ashaavadi ho, khud ko apane se behatar logon se ghira rakhane kaa icchhuk ho, jimmedaari lene or shrey dene ko taiyaar rahe or team ke liye gond kaa kaam kare
 In the sequel to the book, cricket legend Rahul Dravid has written what it means to be a team player
 wo likhte hai- achche khilaadi safalataa ko bahut alag tareeke se dekhte hai or shrey kii chintaa kiye bagaiyr prerit hote hai
 Each player in the team works differently for a win
 jaise- short leg main khadaa fielder na sirf apana sharir khatre main daalata balki kabhi-kabhi ant tak kuch bhi na hasil karne vaala pojishan sabit hota he
 In such a situation, some players shy away from being given this position, while some work hard and become experts
 kyon padhein yah kitabahis kitaab main kaise jeeten, haar rahe hai to kaise seekhen, kaise karen team kaa nirmaan, leaders ke gun or aaj kii duniya main kya-kya chunautiyaan hai, is par bahut baariki se charchaa kii gayi he
 By combining several inspiring statements, a recipe for winning, success and success has been given
 lekhak parichayharsha bhogale ne apni patni anitha ke saath milakar is kitaab ko likhaa he
 Harsha had earlier given collections of his articles in the form of a book called 'out of the Box'
 iske alaava unhone cricketer mohammad ajaharuddin kii biography ‘ajahar’ bhi likhi he
 Harsha is a Chemical Engineer from Osmania University and a PG from IIM, Ahmedabad
 broadcasting kii duniya main utarkar cricket kii duniya main tahalaka machaane se pehle do saal tak vigyaapan or phir agle do saal ek management form main kaam kiya
 While Anita is a Statician from IIT Mumbai and PG from IIM Ahmedabad
 anitha ne bhi kariyar kii shuruyaat vigyaapan form se hi kii thi phir das saalon tak ek vigyaapan kansaltency chalaai, tivi vigyaapan likhe, prodyus kiye or abhi bij pandit (online content librari) main diarector hai
 Apart from this, the couple has also opened a sports based consultancy process for the last 14 years
 ant main main yah jarur kahana chaahunga ki is kitaab ko padhanaa bahut hi energetic he kyonki hamamen se prayek vyakti khel ke madhyam se duniya ko bahut hi aasaani se samaj sakate hai or harsha-anitha ne ise or bhi aasaan bana diya he
 This is a unique gift for everyone who wants to understand everything, small and big through sports, that is going to be useful in moving up the stairs of their life
 aap kisi bhi field main varking kyon na hon aapako yah kitaab padhani hi chahie kyonki yah sports ke udaahranon se management or top par pahunchane or vahaan bane rahane ke nuskhon se bharaa he
 So what is the delay, immediately order 'way to win' and learn some tricks to progress in your life

 sibiai pramukh ranjit sinha kaa centre kii upie sarkaar ko lekar ek sansanikhej bayaan aayaa he
 In an interview to the English newspaper The Economic Times, Sinha said that UPA government would be very happy if Narendra Modi's close and former Gujarat minister Amit Shah were implicated in the Ishrat Jahan fake encounter case
 sinha ne apana bayaan yah sabit karne ke liye diya ki sibiai bina kisi dabaav ke nishpaksh hokar kaam karti he
 According to Sinha, during the investigation in Ishrat Jahan case, he could not find any evidence against Amit Shah
 ranjit sinha kaa yah bayaan aise vakt par aayaa he, jab desh kii siyasat garmai hui he
 Also, this statement has given the BJP an opportunity to target the Center and the Congress, which have been alleging that the Central Government is trying to implicate Narendra Modi and Amit Shah through the CBI
 uttar pradesh sarkaar bhale hi pradesh main kaabil doctoron ke bal par swasthya vyavastha sudhaarney kaa daawa kar rahi he lekin kushinagar janapad ke sanyukt jila chikitsaalay main siemo kaa privet driver bhi marijon kaa ilaaj kar rahaa he
 Surprisingly, this driver is giving drip to the patients along with giving minor medicines

 Not only this, the wards that are kept for wards care and minor ointment are also injected and drip to the patients fearlessly
 tippaniyan The interesting thing is that emergency wards where doctors should be present 24 hours are also missing from the ward and emergency is going on in the district hospital due to these drivers and ward
 pradesh sarkaar ne apane chunavi vaade main gambhir beemaari kaa ilaaj kaa vaada kiya tha lekin pradesh ke chikitsaalayon main saamaanya bimariyon kaa ilaaj driveron or ward byaayon ke sahare chal rahe hai to gambhir beemaari ke marijon kaa kya haal hoga
 The extent of negligence was seen when a woman who had come into the hospital unconscious was carrying four women without stretchers from one ward to another ward while the hospital has a stretcher
 yahi nahin, jis wardbvaay ko vaardon kii dekhbhaal or maamuli maraham pattee ke liye rakhaa jaataa he ve bhi bemauf hokar marijon ko injection or drip chadhaate hai
 The comments maje kii baat yah he ki immergency ward jahaan 24 ghante chikitsak maujuud hona chahie ve bhi ward se gaayab rahete hai or inhen driver or ward byaay ke bharose jila aspataal main immergency kii vyavastha chal rahi he
 The state government had promised to treat critical illness in its election promise but if the treatment of common diseases is being done in the hospitals of the state with the help of drivers and wards, then what will happen to the patients of critical illness

 According to sources, the CBI may seek clarification from Railway Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal in connection with the alleged bribery related to the posting of Mahesh Kumar, the suspended member (staff) of the Railway Board
 sibiai sutron ne bataaya ki agency singla or uske sahyogiyon se poochtacha kar rahi he taaki ‘us adhikari kii bhoomika ko samajha ja sake jo mahesh kumaar ko sadsy (staff) se badalakar sadsy (electrical) kaa pad detaa or mahaprabandhak (pashchim) kaa atirikt prabhaar bhi unke paas rahane detaa
 Sources in the Ministry of Railways said that the direct change in the post of board members is done in the same way as new members are appointed and this happens only after the approval of the vigilance clearance and the approval of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet

 In Maldives, the President Abdulla Yameen has imposed emergency bypassing the order of the Supreme Court
 is siyaasi sankat ke bich raashtrapati yamin kii taanaashaahee ke khilaaf maldive ke vipakshi khemo or supreme court ne bharat se madad kii guhaar lagaai he
 After which India has indicated that the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) can be followed in this case, which includes keeping the army ready
 haalanki, abhi bharat kii taraf se aadhikarik taur par madad kii ghoshnaa nahin kii gai he, sirf sanket die hai, lekin usase pehle hi china kii bechaini bad gai he
 The Chinese Foreign Ministry has said that Beijing is keeping an eye on the Maldives
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa geng shuang ne kaha he, 'hamen ummid he ki maldive sarkaar or vahaan kii vipakshi partiyaan aapas main milakar raajnneetik sankat ko sulajhaa sakate hai
 The Ministry of External Affairs has said that the government and the opposition parties have the intelligence to resolve the political crisis in Maldives
 aise main maldive sankat par kisi antarrashtriya dakhal kii jarurat nahin he
 At the same time, Maldives has been directly alert to India in the Chinese government newspaper Global Times
 lekh main kaha gaya he ki maldive ko bharat kii bhoomika or apane desh kii swatantraaa main se kisi ko chunanaa padegaa
 It was argued that after India wants to control South Asian countries, Maldives will have to beware of this
 darasal, china kii is baukhalaahat ke kai sabab hai
 First, that India is maintaining a strong hold in South Asian neighbors
 doosraa, ye ki purv raashtrapati mohammad nashid or abdul gayum samet maldive ke supreme court ne sidhe taur par bharat se madad kaa aahvaan kiya he
 While relations between incumbent President Abdulla Yameen and China have strengthened
 yahaan tak ki maldive ne china ke saath mukt vyapaar samjhaute par hastakshar bhi kiye hai, jo pakistan ke baad aisa karne vaala doosraa desh ban gaya he
 In such a situation, there is a danger to China that if India's interference threatens the government of Yameen and the opposition party gets power, it can have a wrong effect on the relationship between China and Maldives
 bharat isse pehle bhi ek baar abdul gayum ke daur main sainya bal se maldive kii madad kar chukaa he
 This is the reason why China is advising India to stay away from Maldives
 kya he maldive sankat?maldive ke supreme court ne maujuuda raashtrapati abdulla yamin dwaara banaae gaye rajnatik bandiyon ko reeha karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 At the same time, orders were also given to restore membership of 12 mps expelled by Abdulla Yameen
 magar, yamin ne supreme court kaa order maanane se inkaar kar diya or desh main 15 dinon ke apatkaal kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 After this, other opposing camps including opposition party leader Mohammad Nasheed have appealed to India for help on this issue
