 This is a very difficult question when someone asks what do you think about love? Even more difficult when instructed to tie this feeling to the limit of words
 ye thik vaise hi he jaise aapse koi kahe ki apni aatmakatha ek vaakya main bataaie jaise ji hui zindagi ek vaakya, ek shabd balki ek aatmakatha rupi pustak main nahin sameti ja sakati vaise hi prem kaa bhi hisaab-kitaab he
 Surprisingly, people in the world have also tried to live and celebrate this great feeling and feeling by tying it to one day's celebration, but it is also right that at least one day in the year is declared officially for love
 ye vaise hi he jaise saal main ek din vuman de ke naam se ghoshit kar diya gaya ho or vyavhaar main kya hota he ye alahada baat he
 There are different sides to not liking or not celebrating Valentine's Day
 The first thing that i have in mind is that i disagree - i think love is the feeling that we live every moment, every day
 jab aap prem main hote hai
 So every day is special
 har lamhaa khaas hota he
 And love makes every day, every moment and moment
 baaki har mudde par, har ehsasat par janata kii juda-juda raay hoti he or ye bahut hi swaabhaavik he mujhe nahin lagata ki koi aisa ek din hota he jab aapkaa premi yaa premika khaas hote hai, aap unke liye mahange tohfe khariden, achche kapade, itr, phool, buke, chocolate aadi se lash hokar unhen khaas feel karaaen
 i am not saying that this presentation and presentation is wrong
 mere kehane kaa matlab sirf itnaa he ki kisi ek vishesh din kii darkaar kyon he? aise maukey har din har maukey par aane chahie jab aap apane pyaar ko sirf special hi nahi super special feel karaaen
 Love is a celebration in itself, it does not need any single day
 ham premiyon ke liye roj hi vailemtine he or hona chahie
 It is a matter that if it is the right day and opportunity to propose it for the loving couple, then this thing also seems very childish to me
 hryday ke aavegon ko vyakt karne ke liye sahi samay or sahi din kaa tark kya he?agar aapaki kismat sahi he, aag donon taraf baraabar lagi he phir to vailemtine tak kaa intjaar karnaa ham jaise premiyon ke liye asambhav he
 What is the love in which even such patience should be kept in the expression? So i do not understand the importance of Valentine's Day very much even by this argument
 isaki sarthakata yaa upyogita main sirf is baat main samajhati hum ki ye bhi ek mauka he, ek avasar he jab aap apane pyaar ko or special feel karaaen
 The whole life falls short to feel the sensations of love in their own ways
 yahaan ek din kii baat he?vailemtine de kii sarthakata keval is baat main he ki agar aap kisi ko prapoj nahin kar paa rahe to ye mauka aapako himmat detaa he
 Like in Holi you are almost free to rub a little gulal on someone's cheek
 chhot lete hue aapke andar utsav kaa utsaah swaabhaavik rup se aa jaataa he
 This is just like the courage given under the influence of a special day and a good meaningful beginning
 mere liye prem jivan kii aisi nitant aavashyaktaa he jiske bina sahaj hona mushkil he
 If even a fraction of this need can be understood or explained on this one day, it can be shown, told, expressed, and any day it can wake up, then such a valentine is welcome

 Joshi demanded that the government present the CAG report in the KG Basin case before Parliament in the monsoon session of Parliament and based on this report, ensure immediate action against the guilty
 joshi ne keji basin par kaig report kii charchaa karte hue kendra sarkaar se sidhe sawaal kiye or kaha ki sarkaar yah bataae ki is pariyojna ke liye kya sharten rakhi gayi thim, is par anumaanit vyay kya tha
 He asked that the government should also explain how in four years the cost of natural gas discovery in the KG basin has quadrupled? When the terms of this project were fixed, who was the finance minister of the country? Who were the officers in the respective departments at that time
 unhone kaha ki haal main tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri jayalalita ne desh ke grih mantri pi chidambaram par chunaav parinaam ghotaale kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he jisaki tatkaal jaanch kar sthiti spasht kii jaani chahie
 Joshi demanded that such a scam minister be removed from the Council of Ministers immediately, otherwise it could pose a huge threat to the security and economic condition of the country

 After all, why is BJP taking so long to do this? See 8 big things
 
 
 1
 Attempting to balance caste balance, non-yadav obcs form a major part of the nearly 40 per cent vote share of the BJP, which is about 44 per cent of the total vote share of the entire state
 aise main pehali koshish yah thi ki 2019 ke chunaavon ke liye is varg ko saadhaa jaae
 The first name from this class is Keshav Prasad Maurya, but his lack of experience in the state is coming in the way
 2
 Rajnath Singh is unanimous on Rajnath Singh Rajnath Singh is the former Chief Minister of the state and the biggest leader of Rajputs in the state
 pradesh main rajput bijepi kaa strang vot base maane jate hai
 In this election too, he has voted BJP only to a large extent
 rajya main chune gaye emele main kareeb paanch darjan se zyada rajput he
 But even if there is no vote in the party about Rajnath Singh, his old work behind it is work and ignorance about him among the biggest vote bank Brahmins of the upper castes in the state
 pradesh ke brahman netaaon ke saath unke rishte kabhi madhur nahin maane gaye or rajnath singh ke samay pradesh main bijepi kaa graph bhi lagaataar girnaa unke aade aayaa
 Another important point is that the election of CM is to be done according to the Modi plan of 2019 and in such a situation, there is a need for a young face for fast implementation of the schemes
 3
 The vote bank for Manoj Sinha is Dikkatmanoj Sinha is the biggest name of Bhumihar votes in the state
 halaki bhoomihaar vot rajya main zyada nahin he
 In this election, Bhumihar votes on the face of Manoj Sinha went to BJP
 kendra main apane kaamkaaj ke dauraan manoj sinha ne ek acchhee chhavi bhi banaai he
 Sinha is considered to be the most fit in Modi and Amit Shah's plan and Manoj Sinha can walk fast on the road of development, this is believed to be in the Delhi corridor
 lekin vot bank kii samasya jarur party ko lagati he
 The mathematics of caste politics in the state goes against him a little
 4
 Even if the party has not been able to elect anyone yet, despite the color of the state 2019 Kesariya, then the big reason for this is the concern of the Lok Sabha elections in 2019
 modi sarkaar ko sabase badi takat upi se aane vaale 71 saansadon se mili thi
 Now Modi's eye is to repeat this performance in 2019 and Modi's eye is on such a candidate who can help Modi and Amit Shah in seeking votes on the basis of development
 mukhyamantri chunane kii yahi kavayad ab tak jari he or kisi ko bhi final nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 5
 modi ke vijan se ho talmelsbakaa saath or sabakaa vikaas is naare ke liye modi or amit shah ke plan main ek aisa cheharaa he jo ki puure pradesh main sweekaarya ho
 Old controversies are also associated with old faces in politics, in such a situation, the winning mlas are also looking for such faces who can play on this board and play properly
 nae chehron kii screening ke dauraan is baat par najar kii ja rahi he ki bhale hi cheharaa nayaa ho lekin uskaa vijan modi ji ke vijan se miltaa ho or uske saath koi vivaad na judaa ho
 6
 santulit vichaaron vaale yuva kii talashpure chunaav main modi ko apni hi party ke netaaon ke bayanon se ulajhna padaa tha, lihaaja party ek santulit vichaardhaara vaale yuva kii talash main he jo bayaanbaji se dur aise vikaas project puure kare jo agle do saal main jameen par dikhaai de
 7
 nahin honi chahie koi chukyuva chehre kaa naam final na hone ke peeche ek yah bhi mat party main he ki 2019 ke liye zyada vakt nahin bachaa he lihaaja pad par baithe hue vyakti ko bich main badal kar galati ko sudhara bhi nahin ja saktaa he isliye koi chook na iske liye bhi vichaar-vimarsh kaa daur jari he
 8
 sangh ko bhi aae pasandaise chehre kii talash bhi kii ja rahi he, jis par sangh ko bhi yakeen ho or vah vikaas ke agenda ko bhi chalaa sake
 The search for youth leadership is also because Akhilesh will face the biggest challenge for the party in 2019
 rahul gandhi kii koshish ho sakati he kibispi or esapeco milakar kisi bhi tareeke se yuva chehre ke naam par koi gathbandhan taiyaar kiya ja sake
 That is why the BJP is taking a lot of thought on the selection of the leader

 It is the year of 2004
 bihar ke sivaan jile main chandreshwar prasad urf chanda babu apni patni, beti or chaar beton ke saath rahaa karte the
 He had two shops in the main market
 ek kiraane kii or duusari parchun kii
 His son Satish used to sit at one shop, Girish at another
 16 agast, 2004 kaa din is parivaar ke liye qayaamat banakar aayaa
 Some people were demanding extortion from Chanda Babu
 magar unhone dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 The same people visited his grocery store that day
 dukaan par unka betaa satish baitha
 They asked Satish for two lakh rupees for extortion
 satish ne 30-40 hajaar rupee dene kii baat kahi
 There were more people who came to collect extortion
 unke haathon main hathiyaar the
 They started fighting with Satish
 galle main rakhi do lakh se zyada kii rakam bhi nikaal lee
 Satish's elder brother also came there
 wo bhi sab dekh rahaa tha
 After being beaten, Satish went to the house
 or bathroom saaf karne vaala tejaab ek mag main daalkar laayaa
 He threw all the acid on the miscreants who came to collect extortion
 tejaab ke chhiten uske bhai rajeev par bhi pade
 Crisis of Siwan's acid attack petrol or dijal ke badhate daam par lagaataar ghir rahi sarkaar ab isse raahat dene ke raste talashne main jute gai he
 According to sources, the government has found its way
 iske liye sarkaar exise duty or waite main koi katautee nahin karegi, balki vah iske liye tel nirmaataa companiyon ko aage laane vaali he
 The central government is preparing to provide relief to the common man from the rising prices of petrol and diesel with the help of domestic oil producer companies like Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) and Oil India Limited (OIL)
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki iske liye vah ek nayaa 'tex' laa sakati he
 This tax will be levied on both government and non-government oil companies
 kaise karegaa kamanyus agency pitiai ko sutron ne bataaya, ''yah nayaa tex, jo ses kii shakl main aa saktaa he
 This will be implemented whenever the crude oil crosses $ 70
 '' darasal in tel companiyon ko gharelu str par taiyaar kiye gaye tel ke liye bhi antarrashtriya daron par bhugtan kiya jaataa he
 The government's plan is that whenever crude oil crosses $ 70, these companies will share their profits with the fuel retailer
 aise main ful retaillers kachche tel kii badi hui keemton kaa asar niyantran karne main kaamyaab ho sakenge
 Due to this, the common man will get relief from the unprecedented increase in the prices of petrol and diesel
 pehle bhi apana chuke hai ye tarikayah pehali baar nahin he ki jab sarkaar sarkaar piesu ko badhate daam kaa bhaar uthaane ke liye kah rahi he
 In the past, ONGC and Oil India have paid up to 40 per cent of under recoveries
 darasal sarkaar ne ek adhiktam daam tay kiya tha
 Oil companies had to take the impact of rising prices on them
 is tarah in companiyon ne 13 saal ke liye sarkaar kii taraf se di jane vaali sabsidi kaa bhaar uthaaya tha
 The subsidy paid by the subsidiaries on petrol and diesel ended in June 2015
 isse pehle 2008 main bhi aisa ek tex lagane ke suzav par kaam kiya ja rahaa tha, lekin kern india ke virodh ke baad is prastaav ko lagu nahin kiya gaya
 Now once again the government is preparing to impose a 'windfall tax' on oil producer companies

 After meeting the governor, PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti made a direct attempt to pressurize the BJP through the media
 unhone to bijepi ke saath sarkaar banane kii sambhaavna se inkaar kiya or na hi bijepi ke saath jane kii koi baat hi kii
 On the contrary, talking with 55 mlas, he left an arrow that seems to go together in many directions
 mehabooba ne 55 vidhayakon ke saath kaa daawa bhi sidhe-sidhe nahin kiya, balki media main lagaae ja rahe ganit kaa hawala dete hue kiya
 And the media is counting on the addition of 28 of PDP and 12 of Congress and 15 of NC mlas
 yani pidipi-congress-ensi ke mahagathbandhan ko saamne rakh
 But it is not as if Mehbooba was directly accepted as an alternative to this grand alliance
 balki iskaa wo bijepi ko ye sandesh dene kii koshish karti nazar aati hai ki hamase gathbandhan kar sarkaar banani he to hamaari sharten manani padegi
 Let it be known that among the conditions which are mainly discussed before the BJP from the PDP, the Chief Minister of the PDP for the whole five years and wants some assurance on the laws like Article 370 and AFSPA
 jabaki bijepi baari-baari se 3-3 saal ke liye mukhyamantri or pehle bijepi kaa mukhyamantri chaahati he
 Both parties are not ready to back down from their terms, only then BJP President Amit Shah says that all parties are standing on their positions, so the government is unable to form
 mehabooba ne raajnneetik chaturaai dikhaate hue atal bihari bajpeyi ke vaqt kaa zikr kiya ki jaise vaajapeyi ji ne jammu or kashmir ko lekar jo raajnneetik prakriya shuru kii thi pidipi kendra ke saath mil kar use aage badhanaa chaahati he
 It is obvious that she is trying to present a challenge in front of Prime Minister Narendra Modi by pulling a big line like Vajpayee, which she wants to put the responsibility of not crossing
 unhone is janadesh ko 'divisive' bataa ye jataane kii koshish kii ki ghati main ham hai or jammu main bijepi or 'disisive' kah ye jataane kii koshish kii ki kul jamaa jammu or kashmir kaa janadesh kii loktantrik parinti bijepi or bijepi ke gathbandhan ke taur par hi honi chahie
 
 
 What he did not explicitly say was 'on the terms of the PDP'
 pidipi ke saamne duvidha he ki bijepi ke saath sarkaar banane par mukhyamantri pad nahin milegaa or uske saath nahin banane par kendra sarkaar se madad main rode atkaaye ja sakate hai
 She may lose her land in the valley if she goes with BJP and if she does not reach Delhi
 isliye sabase badi party hote hue bhi usne ab tak sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh nahin kiya he
 The Congress has directly announced its support to the PDP, while the NC is still playing around
 wo pidipi ke saath gathbandhan kaa bhram bhi de rahi he or pidipi-bijepi ke bich shaadi ke pehle talaaq hone kii sthiti main bijepi ke saath bhi phere le sakati he
 PDP understands this politics of NC, so it is not refusing to take the support of NC so far because if tomorrow NC goes with BJP then PDP can stone the flower of nc's support in the valley which NC PDP But the rain was created kul mila kar pidipi sarkaar banane laayak sankhyabal main apni haar ko jeet main badalane kii koshish main he
 BJP and NC are also playing a long circle

 unhone kaha he ki aise candidet jo fail hue hai yaa jinke kam number aae hai, unke paper ko dobaaraa jaanchane kii aavashyaktaa nahin lag rahi he

 vaise man ke dukhon ko dur karne vaale ko mitra kaha jaataa he
 But according to country, time, situation, the definition of friend has changed, now whoever takes our life is our friend
 rana ne kaha ki mitra kii kai prajatiyaan hoti hai jaise mitron kii chaal hi hamaari gati, sugati or durgati kaa kaaran hoti he
 Balsakhas are childhood friends of which later on become some Kalsakhas who throw you out like a milk fly when they are proven to be useful
 ek mitra paalaskhaa bhi hota he jiske paalan-poshan kii jimmedaari hamaari hoti he
 They do not mind being abused and driven away by you, they are raised above human dignity
 ek mitra hote hai dhaal sakha, yah aapke kukarmon ko apane upar jhel lete hai
 This fixes your every mistake immediately, you can also consider them as your mother's option

 assam main taiyaar ho rahe naagarikta register par ab bijepi ko hi bharosa nahin he
 The central and state governments wanted the NRC to re-examine at least 20 percent of the names in its draft list
 supreme court ne ise kaarij kar diya he
 It has relied on the NRC which claims that 27 per cent names have been re-examined
 bijepi kahati he, bina puri jaanch ke enarasi bangladeshi mukt nahin hogi
 Chandan Bhattacharjee, chairman of the conscious citizen forum in Assam, is concerned about the citizenship register being prepared in Assam
 31 agast tak ye list puri ho jaani he
 Chandan's organization signed a complaint last year with the signing of 25 lakh people to the President that Bangladeshis were being included in the draft
 sutron ke mutabik isi memorandam ke aadhaar par sarkaar ne supreme court main arzi di thi ki suchi ke 20% naamon kii phir se jaanch ho
 But the All Assam Minority Union is seeing this as an excuse to hang the NRC further
 wo bhi supreme court main is cese main pakshakaar he
 At the same time, BJP has directly attacked NRC convenor Prateek Hazela about this
 unki niyat par andeh kiya he
 Accordingly, the demand for 20% inquiry is justified
 iske bina list bangladeshi mukt nahin ho paaegi
 The court has considered the report of NRC officials that 2 in the draft list
 89 karod logon main 27 fisadi logon ko phir se jaanch ho chuki he
 Let me tell you, 40 lakh people who were left out of the first draft of NRC, that 16
 2 lakh pariwaron se aate hai
 Of these, 36 lakh people were also re-examined who come from 1
5 lakh families, and had claimed to be in the draft
 2 lakh pariwaron ko shaamil kiye jane par kii jane vaali aapatti kii bhi jaanch kar lee gai he
 For this, the family tree has been used in which many families have been investigated
 is tarah 17 lakh pariwaron kii phir se jaanch ho gai he jo enarasi ke mutabik 35 lakh log hai
 Let me tell you, last year, the Supreme Court had mandated an inquiry of 10 percent and that is why when the NRC said that 27 percent has been re-examined, the Supreme Court did not accept the government's application
 vaise bhi kai tarah kii afavaahen chal rahi hai jinamein ye bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar enarasi puraa karnaa hi nahin chaahati
 While NRC officials have got more time for the final list of quality checks, it remains to be seen what the bjp-led state and central governments do next

 kendra sarkaar ne 1 may 2016 ko real estate sector ko durust karne ke liye real estate regulatory athurity (RERA) act sansad se paarit kara liya tha
 After this, by May 1, 2017, all the states of the country (29 states and 7 Union Territories) were to form authorities by setting rules for RERA based on this Act
 lekin is dedline par desh main kaa koi rajya khara nahin utraa
 The result is that the whole country has failed completely in doing this work, with few exceptions
 kyon jaruri he rajyon kaa RERA actonshaisha act ko sabhi rajyon ko paarit karnaa he
 This is necessary because according to the constitution, the land is in the state list and any law or rule related to land can be made by the state government
 kendra sarkaar kii pahalakendra sarkaar ne houseing mantralay kii pahal par rera act ko banaaya he jisase real estate sector main transperency ke saath-saath builder / develper kii jimmedaari tay kii ja sake
 It is to be noted that the Housing Ministry had taken up this Act by 2022 by the Central Government to take forward its flagship project of the house to all at a rapid pace 
 kyon jaruri he athuritirera act ke praavdhaan ke mutabik rajyon ke rera athurity sabhi builder, develper or home bair ke liye niamak kaa kaam karegi
 Just like SEBI for the stock market and TRAI for the telecom sector
 sector se jude ahm faisle karne kaa adhikaar is athurity ke paas rahegaa or dhokhadhadi karne vaale builder, develper se home byrs kii suraksha kii guarantee bhi yahi niamak degi
 Only after the formation of this authority will the responsibility of the builder / developer, along with the transparency in the real estate sector, begin
 kya rajya nahin chaahate transperency?kendra sarkaar karera actdwara di gai ek-ek dedline biit rahi he
 But most of the states of the country have not even started in the direction of setting rules in this direction, notifying them and creating an authority
 haalanki puure desh main madhyapradesh ek apwaad rajya he jisane is disha main badhat bana lee he
 Madhya Pradesh has completed the task of forming the authority along with notifying its rules
 iske alaava kuch anya rajya hai jinhone antarim athurity kaa gathan kar diya he
 So far only 7 states have notified their law
 rera ko kamjor karne kii kavayad?is sector ke jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki yadi rajyon dwaara is kshetra main or deree kii gai to sambhaavna he ki graahakon ke hit ke uddeshy se banane vaala rera act kamjor rup le le
 Actually, only after the enactment of this state law and the formation of the authority, residential and non-residential projects can be registered under the RERA Act in all parts of the country
 jabatak yah kaam nahin hota he tabatak graahakon ko is act ke tahat di jane vaali suvidhaayen nahin mil sakati hai
 Also, after the formation of this authority, those projects will also have to be registered under the RERA Act within 3 months so that those who have purchased the house can also be exercised to get the house on time

 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko sabase zyada saansad dene vaale karnataka ke netaa or purv mukhyamantri bies yediurppa ghar vaapasi ke liye taiyaar hai
 For this, Modi deployed his people
 magar isse pehle kii is oparation ko anjaam diya jaataa, party ke bujurg laalkrishna adwani ne vito kar diya

 The number came down to 16 before the assembly elections as two mps left with Yeddyurappa
 agar vidhansabha chunaavon ko paimaana maane to bijepi ke liye yahaan dahaai ke ank main janaa bhi sapane jaisaa hoga
 The only hope is that Yeddyurappa should return to the party to present a challenge against the Congress to stop the division of votes
 is ganit ko dhyaan main rakhkar modi ne karnataka ke prabharee party mahasachiv thavar chand gahalot ko is oparation ke liye tainaat kiya
 a plus point for him was that Yeddyurappa supporters were angry with Ananth Kumar and his godfather Advani, not BJP or Modi
 baharhaal, gahalot yediurppa ko manaane main safal ho gaye
 Significantly, till now the leaders of Yeddyurappa's party were saying that if there is no question of withdrawal, they can compromise on the seats
 magar jab sab clear ho gaya, to adwani saamne aa gaye
 He made it clear to the party leaders that there will be no compromise on the issue of corruption
 chaahe party ko siton kaa nuksaan jhelana pade
 Advani is saying that if Yeddyurappa is withdrawn then how will he surround the Congress on the issue of corruption
 adwani kah rahe hai ki party ko karnataka main nae chehron ke dam par sanghathan khadaa karnaa chahie
 According to sources, Advani may be adamant on this issue, but Modi will move ahead with the blessings of the Sangh and Yeddyurappa will be returned saying that the court has not yet proved him a criminal

 It is said that even the leaders of BJP had a hand in the sex CD through which Sanjay Joshi's political career was dealt
 baharhaal, yahaan charchaa he adwani or modi kii adaavat kii
 Both of them then drew swords with the route of Advani's Jan Swabhimaan Yatra in Gujarat
 adwani ko lag rahaa tha ki unke bhi griharajya gujarat main jis tarah kaa swaagat or utsaah dikhnaa chahie tha, vaisaa nahin hua, kyonki modi ne party kii chulein nahin kaseen
 The world saw the previous bickering of both

 Maharashtra Public Works Minister Chhagan Bhujbal is facing the brunt of the battle to retain the top position in the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)
 rajya ke grih mantri aar
 R
 patil ne bhujabal ke khilaaf bijepi netaa kirit somaiya ke ghoose lene ke aaropon kii jaanch karne ke liye bhrashtachar nirodhak beuro (asibi) ko ijaajat de di he
 Somaiya has alleged that Bhujbal misused his office to pay Rs 10,000 crore to the state in awarding the contract to Maharashtra Sadan, the state's guest house to be built in New Delhi
 kaa chuunaa lagaaya he
 The contract was awarded in 2006
 es
 It was given to Chamankar & Co
 and under it a huge guest house was constructed on six acres of land on Kasturba Gandhi Marg located in Lutyens zone of Delhi
 somaiya ne aarope lagaaya ki chamanakar ne bhujabal kii bahu shefali or vishakha kii company idin furniture ko nae guest house main furniture supplai karne kii jimmedaari saunpi thi
 It is clear that Bhujbal's PWD department gave Chamankar an important plot in Andheri, a posh area of mumbai, in return for which Cham Nakar agreed to construct the Maharashtra Sadan for free and repair the High Mount Guest House at Malabar Hill, Mumbai
 somaiya kaa kahana he ki chamanakar ne is project par sirf 150 karod ru
 They have spent Rs 10,000 crore on building a residential and commercial complex on a plot found in Andheri's 'azaab'
 kii kamai kar sakati he
 "the price of residential land in Andheri is Rs 20,000," says Somaiya
 prati varg foot he, jabaki commercial jagah kii keemat 50,000 ru
 Per square foot
 chamanakar ko mila plot 4
 5 lakh square feet
 is prakaar ve isko bechakar 10,000 karod ru
 Can earn ''bhujabal in aaropon ko sire se nakaar dete hai
 He says, "it was during Vilasrao Deshmukh's tenure that a group of three ministers gave this contract to Chamankar
 aise main maine apane pad kaa durupyog kaise kiya? asibi ko jaanch karne den
 i am very sure that the truth will come out
 ''is jaanch ko shuru karne ke liye asibi ko ijaajat dene main patil ne jo gajab kii furti dikhaai usase kai logon kii bhauhen tan gayi hai
 The reason for raising eyebrows is that he has kept a request for a similar inquiry against ncp's Medical Education Minister Vijay Kumar Gavit for two years
 patil safai dete hai ki asibi ko jaanch karne kii ijaajat unhone nahin di he balki yah faisla karnaa uske apane vivek par he
 However, Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan has given a statement, "for this, approval should come from the Home Minister" and the file did not come to him
 isse aisa lagata he ki isamen puri tarah se patil kaa hi haath he
 Sources in the NCP say that Patil is actually paying a favor to Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar who came to his rescue after the Azad Maidan violence on 11 August
 pavaar ke samarthan kii vajah se hi patil apni kursi bachaa paae the
 The source said, "now the chance is in Patil's hands
 ''yah baat sab jaanate hai ki pavaar or bhujabal ek-duusare ko phooti aankh nahin suhate
 Senior leaders of the deputy chief minister's party consider Bhujbal as a roadblock to becoming their next chief minister
 naam na chhapane kii shart par patil ke ek samarthak daawa karte hai ki grih mantri kaa yah faisla vastav main bhujabal ko hi phayda pahunchayegaa kyonki jaanch ke maamle main asibi kaa record kharaab rahaa he
 In the last ten years, she has been able to prove the blame against only 10 people
 use apni jaanch khatm karne ke liye koi samay-seemaa bhi nahin di gai he
 "by allowing the ACB to investigate, in reality Patil has taken the risk of counteracting Bhujbal
" ''patil samarthak ne patil ke niyantran vaali mumbai police kii aarthik aparaadh shakha (eodblyoo) ke july main bombai hoicourt main die halafname kaa ullekh kiya
 In it, the IOW said that there was no cognizable offense against Bhujbal and his family on charges of misuse of funds or property of Bhujbal-led Mumbai Education Trust (MET)
 emiti ke trustee sunil karve ne shikaayat kii thi ki shefali or vishakha trust kii aath manjila imaarat kii ek floor kaa istemaal pichley aath saal se bina kiraaya die apane furniture showrooms ke taur par kar rahi hai
 In this way he spent 117 crores
 kaa nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 May luck be with Bhujbal once again

 '' (input bhashaa se) NYAY has once again brought the debate of financial, fiscal discipline and poverty into focus, with Congress President Rahul Gandhi's plan to guarantee every poor family a minimum income of Rs 72,000 annually
 vittiya anushaasan kii koi kitni hi baat kar le, lekin sach to yah he ki bharat main abhi bhi jitani badi sankhya main garib log hai, uski vajah se NYAY jaisi yojanaayen behad jaruri ho jaati hai
 Around 36 in India
 4 karod garib hai jo ki america kii samoochee jansankhya se bhi zyada he
 Economic inequality in India is more than any other country in the world

 The truth is that this inequality of income in India is not an automatic result of development, but because of the policies adopted after liberalization

 40 million people were poor

 Is more than 8 crores
 is report main garibi ko aankane ke liye swasthya, shiksha, jivan dasha jaisi chizon ko dhyaan main rakhaa gaya he or 10 sanketakon ko shaamil kiya gaya he

 Experts also say that even though the Left parties are seeking their own land in Bihar in the Lok Sabha elections, it is also a fact that in seven to eight seats in Bihar, they maintain their base and they influence the outcome

 Left parties are considered to have influence in Ara, Siwan, Begusarai, Pataliputra, Karakat, Ujiarpur, Madhubani seats of Bihar
 bhakpa (maale) ke rajya sachiv kunal kehete hai, "kai daur kii baatcheet ke baad mahagathbandhan main seat bantwaare ko lekar baat nahin bani he, magar baatcheet jari he

 Millions of families have been affected by Aadhaar seeding being run against those who get facilities on the wrong basis in government schemes
 yojanaon ko lagu karne ke liye chalaae ja rahe is kaarykram kii vajah se jharkhand ke kareeb 16 lakh pariwaron ko milane vaali suvidha ab band ho gai he
 In particular, it has affected various beneficial schemes like MNREGA, scholarship, public distribution system, housing construction

 sarkaar kii flagship yojanaon main se ek manaregaa par bhi iskaa asar padaa he
 In this, more than one lakh job cards have been canceled
 ye sab mahaj ek saal ke dauraan kiya gaya he
 But seeding has also hit thousands of needy people
 jo afasaron dwaara bhautik satyaapan nahin kiye jaane se sarkari yojanaon se vanchit ho gaye
 In fact, all this has happened due to the mandate of Aadhaar in some government schemes
 haalanki yojanaon ke digitalijeshan kii vajah se farjivade kii rokthaam main sahaayta bhi mili he
 But in some cases, the government also listed such families in fake ration card holders because their ration card was not linked to Aadhaar
 rashan nahin milane se bhi huimautanzaruratmandon ke rashan card radd kiye jane se rajya main bhukh se mautein bhi hui
 Of these, 11-year-old Santoshi of Simdega died due to starvation

 This was accepted by the Minister of Food, Public Distribution and Consumer Affairs, Saryu Rai himself
 isi tarah devgarh ke rupalal maanjhi ke parivaar ko do maheene se rashan isliye nahin mila tha kyonki i-pioes mashin ne unke anguuthe ke nishaan ko nahin sweekaara tha
 Itwaria Devi of Garhwa had not received ration for three months
 saath hi do maheene se pension band thi

 According to the police, he was killed to avenge a slap

 Singh and his mother Gurucharan Kaur were found dead on September 23 in suspicious condition at their residence Phase-3, B-2 in Mohali
 tabhi se police maamle kii chaanbin kar rahi thi
 Meanwhile, the police investigation reached Bulandshahr in UP
 iske baad police ne bulandshahr nivasee gaurav kumaar naamak ek yuvak ko giraftaar kar liya
 The police took from him
 je
 Singh's phone, ATM card and car were also recovered
 aaropee ne car par phek number plate laga rakhi thi
 While disclosing this sensational double murder, police said that on September 22, accused Gaurav Kumar in Mohali

 Mohali DSP Alam Vijay Singh said that the accused has confessed to his crime
 bataate chalem ki keji singh indian express samachar patr ke news editor rahe the
 He also worked in The Times of India and The Tribune
 yah prasiddh ukti he ki jise zyada mila hota he, usase zyada paane kii bhi ummid kii jaati he
 Two years later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi must have understood the meaning of this biblical statement, when he has to give daily time to review the functioning of his government and brainstorm on the strategy of programs and plans for the next three years
 Used to be
 jarur padhein: kaisaa rahaa gadakari kaa pradarshyapanemantrimandalki haalia baithak main modi apni sarkaar ke kai faislon or nitiyon ke lagu hone main ho rahi deree ko lekar buree tarah khiz gaye
 He said that while a law is being prepared for parliamentary approval, at the same time, the relevant ministry should make such rules for it, so that there is not much difference of time between the President's approval and the benefit of the public
 unhone apni sarkaar dwaara anusuchit jati or janajati (essi / asti) ko zyada sangrakshan dene sambandhi pesh kiye gaye sanshodhan kaa hawala diya, jise 1 janvari ko hi raashtrapati kii manjuuri mil gai thi, lekin ise 26 janvari ko adhishuchet kiya gaya
 See in pictures: Narendra Modi's journey from zero to summit
 
 
 modi ne dikhaai majbooteedesh kii naukarshahi or nyaaypalika se jiskaa bhi sabaka padaa hoga, vah samaj saktaa he ki sirf teen hafte main kisi kaam ko nipta paanaa kitni badi baat hogi
 However, this is not a big deal for the impatient Modi, who is always in a hurry and who believes that work on any plan should start the very next day after it is announced
 aagaamee 26 may unke do saal kekaryakalaki samaapti kaa mauka hoga
 Nothing could be more difficult in the world — to fulfill the aspirations of more than one billion people in the world's largest democracy
 modi ko is baat kaa puraa ehsaas he ki unhen ek nirnaayak janadesh mila he, jo 1984 main rajeev gandhi ke baad kisi duusare pradhanmantri ko nahin mila tha
 They appear determined to take millions of small steps towards rejuvenation of this country
 tasviren: jaaniye modi ne kaise lee apane 'guru' kii jagahakuch nayaa karne kii chahat barkaraarunhen kursi par baithe 700 se zyada din ho rahe hai, lekin kaam ke maamle main unamem ab tak ratti bhar thakaan nahin dikhti, bhale hi unke kai sahyogi post ho chuke hon
 Even after the exhausting cabinet meetings that last until after dinner, he seems more agile than his younger colleagues
 unki sarkaar main unase zyada yatraaen desh or videsh main kisi ne nahin kii hai
 Even now, his desire to do something different is still intact
 pichhali baar kii ginati tak unhone svachh bharat se lekar beti bachaao or kushal bharat se start ap tak kul 30 nai pahalon kaa bahuprachaarit elaan kiya he
 In terms of counting of programs and schemes, he has left behind the famous 20 point program of Indira Gandhi and six technology campaigns of Rajiv Gandhi
 sarkaar ko siio kii tarah chalaate hai piem modimodi ke haath main is sarkaar kii kaman he or ve puure utsaah se aage bade ja rahe hai
 They run the government like the ceos of a big business house, set the agenda, demand accountability and get out of the middle of red tape
 unke kai mantri pehali baar apni jimmedaari nibhaa rahe hai, lihaaja is simit pratibhabal ke dabaav main unhone naukarshahon kaa aashray liya he or unka piemo faisle lene or nateezon kii nigaraanee karne main sabase taqatvar banakar ubhara he
 Such agile control easily gives way to allegations of centralization, but it has assured that no major scandal has surfaced in his government so far
 jaankaar maanate hai ki sheersh str par bhrashtachar upie sarkaar ke mukaable kaaphi kam hua he
 In his second year, he forced his ministers to show the result
 pehle saal main unhone is maamle main kuch sankoch bartaa tha, lekin usase unka aatmavishvaas majboot hua tha
 Modi is equally aware of how complex management of a country can be, where you can give instructions, but there is no guarantee that it will be accepted at a lower level and the results will start to show
 ve bade paimaane par kayakalp karne kii apni kshamta ko lekar ab pehle se kahin zyada vyaavhaarik ho chuke hai
 Instead of relying alone on their broad mandate, they have probably understood that they will now need to make comprehensive reforms at every level, from root to branch
 ye bhi padhein: ummiido par kitne khatre utre vitt mantri jetalivinston churchill kii tarah modi bhi maanate hai ki sambhaav gadahon kaa gun hota he
 In his first year, he criticized previous government programs such as MNREGA and Aadhaar, but by the second year, he has embraced both openly and claimed that his government has made delivery more efficient
 ve aparamparaagat kaamon ko karne main bhi nahin sakuchaae hai
 If his predecessor Manmohan Singh kept arguing over whether to visit Pakistan or not for two years, Modi, unlike him, suddenly landed in Lahore to greet Nawaz Sharif on his birthday and his granddaughter's wedding on Christmas last year

 desh main bhale isaki aalochana hui ho, lekin isse duniya main bharat kii aditol chhavi ko naram banane main kaaphi phayda pahunchaa
 In the second year of the Sabkamodi taken by PM from his works, it is clear that he has taken lessons from his work and has become more creative within his limits
 haalia bajet main garibon or kisaanon ke prati spasht samarthan dekhne ko mila, jisane vipaksh kii is aalochana ko khaarij kar diya ki yah 'suut-boot kii sarkaar' he
 He inaugurated the biggest farmer insurance scheme ever since independence, which will provide protection to farmers and loss of irrigation schemes, as well as maintain financial balance
 krishi kshetra ke liye yah kadam badi raahat ke rup main saamne aayaa he kyonki unki sarkaar ko bhale hi petroleum tel kii kam keemton ke kaaran thodi aasaani hui ho, lekin modi ko do saal tak lagaataar kharaab monsoon kii viraasat bhi mili thi jisase unhen nipatna tha
 It is the first drought in 30 years that has impoverished most of rural India
 isse gramin arthvyavastha lagbhag thapp ho gai he
 One can complain about the methods of calculation on the economic front also successful on the economic front, but the fact is that the annual GDP growth rate7
 5 fisadi par bani hui he jabaki vaishvik vruddhi dar isse kaaphi neeche he
 Compared to the last years of the UPA government, the Modi government has worked hard to improve India's image abroad and restore confidence in investors
 yah bhi gauratlab he ki do saal pehle jab unhone kaman sanbhali thi to korporate kshetra kaa bahikhaata baari dabaav main tha, banking kshetra duubate karjon (enpie) ke boj tale dabaa tha or vaishvik vittiya sankat ke kaaran niryaat lagbhag rasaatal main pahunch chukaa tha
 According to Modi's calculations, this was probably not the right opportunity to implement the huge reforms that the Margaret Thatcher-style he promised
 isaki bajaae unhone dhire-dhire aarthik sudhaar kii niti ko apanaaya
 There is more of a practicality in their decisions
 koi shashakt aarthik duuradrushti or nitiyaan usamen nihit nahin hai
 They are adept at efficient compliance, which focuses on processes to make things seamless and speed up business
 yah bhi gaur kiya ja saktaa he ki rigerv bank ke governor raghuram rajan ke kathor maudrik niyantran par aapatti hone ke baavjood modi ne ise vaisaa hi rahane diya or yah aashwast kiya ki buniyadi aarthik prabandhan thos bana rahe, mudrasphiti neeche bani rahe, rupaya sthir rahe or chaalu khaataa va vittiya ghate kaa lakshya puraa hota rahe
 He has also assured that the funding of infrastructure and ease of infrastructure for farmers should be more than adequate
 chaahe vah railway ho, rajmarg, bandargah, power plant yaa petroleum
 All these areas have received adequate funds and Modi is personally monitoring their progress
 yah aashcharya kii baat nahin he ki aarthik or buniyadi sanrachana ke kshetron se jude unke mantriyon arun jetali, nitin gadakari, suresh prabhu, dharmendra pradhan or piyush goyal ko india today kii team ne kaamkaaj ke maamle main ucch reating di he
 Overall, much more remains to be done in the coming years, but Modi deserves more points for efficient management of the economy
 videsh niti ke maamle main modi kaa anubhav kaaphi kam tha, lekin unhone chaunkaane vaala kaam kiya he or nattejey dikhaae hai
 They have exploited foreign policy efficiently to promote domestic development
 videsh sachiv es
 Jaishankar compares Modi's frequent foreign trips to the famous Japanese leader Tomomi Iwakura, who went abroad to study industries, institutions and best practices during the first two years of his reign, and who did Meiji in the 19th century Used that knowledge in the modernization of Japan after the Restoration
 modi duniya bhar ke deshon main anathak yatraaen karke na sirf desh kii chhavi ko nai bulandi de rahe hai balki badi mehnat se ek aakarshak nivesh sthal ke rup main bharat ko bechney kaa kaam bhi kar rahe hai
 He traveled to 12 countries in 2014-15, giving him the assurance of $ 20 billion foreign direct investment
 jaishankar modi kii videsh niti par ekaagratha kii tulana jawaharlal nehru se karte hai, jinhone bharat kii aarthik buniyaad rakhane main duusare deshon se sakriy madad lee thi
 In this campaign, the approach of keeping neighbors paramount may have stuck in Pakistan, but they have strengthened relations with Bangladesh by entering into historic land transfer border agreements, improving relations with Bhutan and Myanmar and relations in Afghanistan and Maldives
 Lost land is regained
 pakistan ke maamle main bhale hi unhen kai baar you-turn lene ke liye kosa gaya ho, lekin ve islamabad ke saath achche rishte kaayam karne ko vachanabaddh rahe hai, basharte vah apane gharelu aatank ke kaarkaanon par lagaam kase
 The problem is that in Pakistan, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is no longer running in front of the Pakistani army and the military rulers never want a good relationship with India

 There has been little influence of India in the past
 badi takaton ke bich china ke saath kai utaar-chadhaavon ke baad ek santulan kii sthiti saadh lee gai he, rus ke saath aarthik gathjod shashakt hua he or america raashtrapati baraak obama ke saath to modi ne jabardast dostana kaayam kar liya he

 Narasimha Rao's policy of liberalization, Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Pokaran-2 nuclear test or the us-india nuclear deal by Manmohan Singh

 While the performance of the Modi government topped the economy, infrastructure and foreign policy, its overall performance appears to be weak due to two important fronts: social and political
 modi kii rajnatik pravritiyaan bahut sookshm hai
 Due to these, he alone brought his party to a tremendous mandate in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, but after coming to power, there have been many occasions that he has become an ostrich on purpose
 unhone kai vibhaajankaree masalon par lambii chuppi saadh lee
 In the fad of its goal of Congress-mukt Bharat, the BJP has almost neutralized Parliament and the rest of the opposition does not seem interested in taking it with them
 parinamswaroop bhoomi adhrihan samet jiesti jaise ahm vidheyak dhul chaat rahe hai
 Not only this, his party's activism in non-bjp states is also dissolving heat in the atmosphere
 is dauraan modi sirf nehru-gandhi parivaar par hamalaa karne main lage hue hai
 His personal popularity may still be maintained and he is heavier than any other BJP leader in terms of weight, but the electoral defeats in Bihar and Delhi have inflicted a hole in his invincibility balloon that the pressure of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh They have become more innocent next to
 rajyon ke chunaav main nattejey dene ke maamle main unke ghatate samathrya ne sangh ke bheetar baithe kuch ativaadee tatwon ko mauka diya he ki ve modi ke vikaas ke agenda se dhyaan bhatka saken
 They may think of Sanghi elements like Churchill, who said that "if you think of stoning every barking dog on the way, you will never reach your destination," but of course some opportunities
 Had come, when he should have decisively restrained such elements so that he could become a Nazir for the rest
 isaki bajaae unhone sangh or bijepi ko deshbhakti or gomance pratibandh jaise vibhaajankaree masalon ko lekar aasaani se is ummid main ud jane diya ki isse voton kaa dhruvikaran ho sakegaa
 LK Advani had recognized the extent of such dilemmas only in the nineties
 modi ne agar jaldi hi is sabase sabak nahin liya to ek bharat, shreshth bharat kaa unka lakshya khokhla jumala banakar rah jayega
 India Today gives a silver medal to Modi for the entire work, but to get the gold medal, he has to strengthen the areas where he has suffered setbacks and solve the problems that are blocking his path
 spasht he ki arthvyavastha, vikaas or saamaajik kalyaan unki praathamiktaayen honi chahie
 The growing discontent from the Jats to the Patidars, the rift that took place from Rohit Vemula's suicide to the arrest of Kanhaiya Kumar is a sign that resentment is increasing due to lack of social development and rising unemployment
 modi ne jin yojanaon or kaaryakramon kii pahal kii he, unke teji se kriyanvayan par unhen dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 If schemes like Start Up India, launched to exploit the entrepreneurial potential of such a large country, have to succeed, they will need all kinds of institutional support from time to time
 lakshyon or kaaryakramon ko ghoshit karne ke saath modi ko yah bhi spasht taur par tay karnaa hoga ki unki sarkaar unhen hasil karne kii kya ummiden rakhti he
 They should also decide how they will come down to the ground and how long the people will get real relief from them
 unhen zyada samaveshi nazariye se kaam karnaa hoga, jahaan garib or bazaar ko ek duusare ke virdohi ke rup main nahin, paraspar sahyogi ke rup main dekha jaae
 An economic liberalism that can simultaneously serve the development and the poor is what India needs
 yah dikhaata he ki desh ab revadissan baantne kii congressi niti se aage badhkar swaavlambee ho rahaa he, jahaan logon ko rojgaar milenge or ek ausat naagarik ke bheetar atmasamman kaa bhav paidaa hoga
 The leadership of some important ministries is in loose hands and Modi should tell them that they should either fix their tricks or they should be removed
 modi kaa kaam isliye aasaan ho jaataa he kyonki yah desh ab bhi maanakar chal rahaa he ki unke paas desh ke gambhir sawaalon ke jawaab maujuud hai
 There is no scope for doubt in this
 tisare saal main modi kaa pradarshan jaisaa rahegaa, vahi unke duusare kaarykaal kii neenv taiyaar karegaa
 Meeting positive global leaders restored the positive image of India in the world; Curbing corruption and transparency in government; More emphasis on infrastructure and rural areas, such as anti-socialism and beef restrictions, and openly refrained from speaking on issues of society; Unable to align with the opposition in Parliament and bridge the legislative gap; The PMO has become the most powerful in the face of electoral defeats in Delhi and Bihar, due to the lack of transparency and accountability, a clear vision of measuring results and a pragmatic approach to teamwork
 High centralization, but now ministers are being encouraged to show results

 unhone kaha, grih mantri ji ardhsainik balon ke pratinidhi mandal se milakar unki sari samasyaon kaa turant nivaaran karen
 He also demanded a 'one rank-one pension' scheme for the paramilitary forces on the lines of the army
 deependra singh hooda ne kaha, centre sarkaar ne 1 janvari 2004 ko jo nai pension yojana ardhsainik balon ke liye lagu kii thi uski jagah puraani pension yojana hi lagu kii jaae
 The soldiers of the paramilitary force who sacrificed their lives while protecting the country, should also be given martyr status on the lines of the army
 shahid-shahid main fark nahin ho saktaa isiilie shahid hone par inke pariwaron ko bhi sabhi suvidhaayen or sena ke samaan muaavja milanaa chahie
 In the current environment, our paramilitary forces are also protecting the country shoulder to shoulder with the army and their contribution can not be underestimated
 isi liye ardhsainik bal yaa paramilitary forcej kii jagah ab inkaa naam 'internal security forcej' rakhaa janaa chahie
 What is One rank-one Pension Scheme? Give, the retired army from Indian Army was mother of One rank-one Pension (OROP) for a long time
 unke mutabik, ritair phogiyon ko unke rank ke hisaab se pension milani chahie na ki ritair hone ke saal ke aadhaar par
 The Modi government issued an order for implementation of OROP on 7 September 2015 after a long agitation over this demand
 haalanki, purv sainikon ke sanghathan is prakriya main badlaav kii maang bhi karte rahe
 Subsequently, on 14 December 2015, the government formed a one-member judicial committee
 is samiti ne apni siforishein sarkaar ko saunp di hai, jis par aantarik samiti vichaar kar rahi he
 The paramilitary forces are also demanding that after this demand raised by soldiers retiring from Indian to Na, retired soldiers from paramilitary forces are also demanding OROP
 deependra hooda ne isi maang ko aaj sadan main uthaaya
 Also demanded to implement the old pension scheme

 Today is the death anniversary of Ram Manohar Lohia, India's freedom fighter, sharp thinker and socialist politician
 ram manohar lohia kaa janm 23 march 1910 ko uttar pradesh ke faijabad hua tha
 His father Mr
 Hiralal was a teacher by profession and a true patriot at heart
 unke pitaaji gandhiji ke anuyaayi the or un par bhi gandhiji ke viraat vyaktitv kaa un par gaharaa asar hua
 Ram Manohar Lohia, a great freedom fighter and socialist leader who had created a reputation for non-congressism in the country, wanted socialists from all over the world to come together and build a strong platform
 lohia bhartiya raajnneeti main gaiyr congresavad ke shilpi the or unke athak prayaason kii vajah se saal 1967 main kai rajyon main congress ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa, haalanki centre main congress jaise-taise satta par kabiz ho pai
 Although Lohia died in 1967, he pursued the ideology of non-congressism
 usee kii vajah se aage chalakar 1977 main pehali baar centre main gaiyr congressi sarkari bani
 Lohia believed that the Congress had become authoritarian by staying in power for a long time and he continued to fight against it
 ram manohar lohia aazaadee ke vakt yuva the or desh kii aazaadee or bantwaare ke ghatnakram ko bahut kareeb se dekh rahe the
 According to one of his books, Lohia enumerated the eight main reasons for independence
 isamen britani kapat, congress netritv kaa utaaravay (dhalaan), hindu-muslim dangon kii pratyaksh paristhiti, janata main dridhtaa or samarthy kaa abhaav, gandhi kii ahimsa, muslim lig kii footneeti, avasaron se laabh uthaa sakane kii asamarthta or hindu ahankaar shaamil he
 Nehru was also given a 'mother' - before 1962, the former Prime Minister was contesting from Phulpur and at that time Lohia was campaigning against him
 darasal lohia yah acchhee tarah jaanate the ki raajnneeti main virdohi ko khatm karne se pehle jad ko khatm karnaa aavashyak he
 The Congress had more resources in this election, but Lohia fought fiercely in front of Nehru
 is chunaav main nehru un-un kshetron main peeche rahe, jahaan-jahaan lohia ne chunavi sabha ko sambodhit kiya tha
 Active in Quit India Movement - After Gandhiji and other Congress leaders were arrested, Lohia went underground and spread the 'quit India Movement' across the country
 lohia, achyut patavardhan, sadik ali, purushottam tikram das, mohanlal saxena, ramnandan mishra aadi netaaon kaa kendriya sanchaalan mandal banaaya gaya tha, lohia par niti nirdhaaran kar vichaar dene kaa kaarybhaar saunpa gaya
 On 20 May 1944, Lohia was arrested in Bombay
 giraftaar ke baad lahore kile kii ek andheri kothri main rakhaa gaya jahaan 14 varsh pehle bhagat singh ko faansee di gai thi
 Along with this, he continuously worked to keep the fire of freedom burning continuously
 30 sitambar 1967 ko lohia ko nai dilli ke wellingdon aspataal yani lohia aspataal main aaparishan ke liye bhartee kiya gaya, jahaan 12 oktober 1967 ko unka dehanth 57 varsh kii aayu main ho gaya

 After May 23, the biggest challenge will be to create sufficient number of jobs for any party to form the government at the Center
 rojgaar par focus in aankadon ko dekhte hue behad jaruri he ki har saal desh main 1
 28 crore new people come in search of jobs
 iske alaava har saal kareeb 90 lakh log kheti chhodkar duusare sector main kaam karne ke liye apane gaanv-kasbe se palaayan kar jate hai
 No official data has been revealed yet, but that periodically leaked nsso's Periodic Labor Force Survey (PLFS) report in the media has been in considerable discussion, saying that the unemployment rate of 6 in 2017-18
 1 fisadi tak pahunch gai jo 45 saal main sabase zyada he
 Unemployment has been said to be the biggest concern of the people in almost all the electoral surveys conducted in previous years
 kya hai chunautiyaneneseso kii PLFS report main kai chijen saaf hai- khuli berogari kii dar main tej badhat hui he
 2 of this year 2011-12
 2 fisadi ke mukaable saal 2017-18 main 6
 Has reached 1 percent
 is dauraan kareeb 4
 7 crore people are unemployed
 yah kul kaaryshil jansankhya (15 se 60 saal) ke aadhe se zyada he
 This is the situation when there has been a sharp increase of 7% in GDP in all these years
 to iconomic survey 2014-15 or azim premaji uniwarsity ke study, donon se yah saaf he ki bharat kii jidipi growth jobles he yani isamen kam se kam naukariyon kaa srijan ho rahaa he
 In the 70s and 80s, when the GDP growth rate was 3–4%, employment was increasing at 2%, but now even after GDP growth is close to 7%, employment growth is 1% or less
 
 neshnal institute of public finance and policy (NIPFP) ke professor bhanumoorti kehete hai ki ab kam rojgaar srijan vaale utpaadan gatividhiyon se zyada rojgaar srijan vaale sector par focus karnaa hoga
 According to the Monthly Economic Report (MER) of the Ministry of Finance, March 2019, 8 of the real GDP 2016-17
 2 fisadi se ghatakar 2018-19 main 7 fisadi tak rah gaya he
 This means that the GDP growth rate needs to be accelerated again firstly, because employment generation is not likely without it
 focus aria kii kerani hogi pahachaanaisaliye nai sarkaar kaa sabase pehla focus aarthik vruddhi par honi chahie
 Looking at government data shows that India's GDP growth has been dependent on domestic consumption and government spending over the past few years, as two other engines of growth are not growing private investment and exports
 ab to gharelu khapat main bhi badhat nahin ho rahi he
 In such a situation, the only support is to increase government expenditure which is 1 in GDP in the year 2016-17
 9 fisadi se ghatakar saal 2018-19 main 1
 Only 7 percent is left
 iske liye aarthik gatividhi badhaani hogi, arthvyavastha main maang paidaa kerani hogi or nijee nivesh aakarshith karnaa hoga
 So while the new government will have to increase public spending, it is also necessary that this expenditure should be more on intensive labor sectors so that more employment is created
 krishi kii baat kii jaae to yah sinchai, cold storage aadi main ho saktaa he, iske alaava manaregaa ke vistaar, gramin swasthya or shiksha ke buniyadi dhaanche, sadak aadi main yah ho saktaa he
 Many labor-intensive non-agricultural sectors are not generating enough jobs
 ab swasthya or shiksha jaise kshetra sabase zyada rojgaar srijan karne vaale ban gaye hai
 According to a recent study, there are ample opportunities for job creation in social sectors like education, transport and other public services, hospitality
 iske alaava robotics, artificial intelegence, 3di priting, big data analysis, cloud technology jaise ubharate kshetron main naukariyon ke srijan kii acchhee sambhaavna he
 The two ambitious schemes of the government immediately in need of the National Employment Policy, 'skill India' and 'make in India', failed to make any structural changes in the employment sector and generate sufficient employment
 sabase dukhad yah he ki is baat ko hi nakaarne kii koshish kii gai ki koi samasya bhi he or ise dur karne ke bare main koi pahal bhi nahin kii gai
 a study of Azim Premji University on the employment situation, stating the vulnerability of the problem, said, "there is an urgent need to consider a national employment policy comprehensively

 Metro train is more alive than the pride of Delhi
 roj lakhon logon ko unki manzil tak le jaati he
 But your privacy in Delhi Metro may also be in danger
 yahaan suraksha ke liye lagaae gaye sisitivi camere se kai ashleel esemes banaae gaye, jinhen porn cites par aplod kar diya gaya
 Metro changed the life of Delhi, the capital of the country
 bason ke dhakke khaati dilli airkandishnar metro train main savaar hui, to vikaas kii bulandiyaan iske mizaaj main shaamil ho gai
 The metro became Delhi's lifeline
 lekin isi life line se aisi tasviren chhanakar baahar nikaleen, jisane metro ko sharmasaar kar diya
 Which has put a bad mark on the Delhi Metro, which gives a ride of pride in the country's capital
 sawaal uthta he ki
 
 
 Are pornographic photos being taken from the CCTV cameras installed in the metro? Are those pornographic images being taken as MMS? And are those pornographic MMS being put on porn sites? The answer to all these questions is riding the metro Enough to shock those
 ye sawaal sisitivi camaron kii nigaraanee karne waalon par bhi gambhir sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 This is because objectionable pictures of boys and girls incarcerated in metro trains and stations have come before the world in the form of MMS
 metro main safar karne vaale is khabar se pareshaan hai
 CCTV cameras have been installed in Delhi's metro rail to protect people
 un camaron se ye pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he ki koi apradhi kisi vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke makasad se andar to nahin ghus aayaa
 But those CCTV cameras are becoming obscene MMS and are being uploaded on porn sites
 ajtak ke haath lagi khabaron ke mutabik, saal 2011 main ye tasviren us vakt record ho gayi jab sisitivi camaron se beparwaah kuch premi jode ashleel harakatein kar rahe the
 CCTV footage was shot from mobile phones and their video clips were uploaded and uploaded to some porn sites on the Internet
 philhal, aise 3 video clip kaa pataa chalaa he jinamein se 2 metro train ke bheetar record hui hai or teesraa video green park metro stesan kii sunsaan jagah kaa he
 But according to reports from Metro Rail sources, the obscene MMS in the metro can hurt the hearts of so many lovers
 kyonki aisi ashanka he ki teen se zyada ms porn cites par aplod kiye gaye ho sakate hai
 There is a direct attack on privacy
 These incidents are true that metro is to make travel convenient and easy
 metro kaa istemaal bhi isiilie hona chahie
 But the CISF, which is looking at the Delhi Metro and its security, is under question
 jab shaam kaa vajood raat ke andhere main khone lagata he, tab dilli metro ke sisitivi camaron main kai baar waisi tasviren utarane lagati hai, jo behad aapattijanak hoti hai
 The extent is that for security, the CCTV cameras of the metro where the photos are captured, if something obscene happened in it, then those photos reach the porn sites
 yani sidhe aapaki privesi par hamalaa
 But the amazing thing is that both the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, which runs the metro rail, DMRC and the Central Industrial Security Force, ie CISF, engaged in the security of the metro, are losing their control
 dilli metro se chand sawallekin logon ke adhikaron kii baat karne vaale is ghatana se behad khafa hai
 If the people of Delhi trust the most, then it is the Delhi Metro Rail
 lekin ab yahi bharosa sawaal kar rahaa he ki
 
 
 - How did the CCTV footage of the metro considered to be very safe reached the porn sites? - If there was no question of security in these pictures, then why were they not eliminated? Didn't know what was going on in the Metro? In the case of year-old photographs, it was raised to investigate how the footage is leaking, but the extent is that the porn clips have stopped speaking of DMRC and CISF
 mahila ayog ne dmarsi ko bheja noticelekin mahila ayog behad khafa he
 The Women's Commission has taken the initiative and sent a notice to the DMRC
 mahila ayog ne dmarsi se do hafton main hi acshan teken report yani atiar maanga he
 The Women's Commission has expressed its concern that if the footage of the metro continues to leak like this, it will be difficult for women to travel in the metro
 kaayade se to dilli metro or siaisef ko is par apni raay rakhni chahie
 But according to reports from sources, where the CISF wants to save its neck by saying that even though it is its responsibility to monitor the CCTV footage, the DMRC still has the database
 vahiin dmarsi kii safai he ki chunki siaisef bhi control room main footage dekhati he, lihaaja sirf dmarsi par hi sara thikra nahin phoda ja saktaa
 Although the truth of the Delhi Metro and the CISF are expected to open in two weeks due to the activeness of the Women's Commission, the MMS scandal of the Metro has certainly shaken everyone
 maamle main kya-kya ho sakati he karravidilli kii pahchaan he metro train
 But this identity remains the enemy of many lives these days
 dilli metro ke camere se jin logon kaa ashleel ms bana, unke liye metro kaa safar kisi daraavne sapane se kam nahin hoga
 Investigation Box has been opened
 dilli metro doshi he yaa siaisef yaa donon ke kuch adhikariyon ne milakar ye ghinauni harakat kii he, iskaa khulaasa hone main vakt lagegaa
 But it is also certain that for those who are guilty, the days ahead are going to be very difficult
 jaankaron ke mutabik, footage kii gopniyata kii puri jimmedaari dmarsi par jaati he
 a case can be registered against those who upload pornographic photos under Section 66E and 67 of the Information Technology Act 2000

 Umesh Kumar, the owner of Famous Manohar Dhaba named Japanese Samosa, says in its specialty that this samosa is completely different from all other samosas, both in name and in appearance
 haa, par swaad main purna rup se hindustani he
 Its specialty is that this samosa has 60 layers, and because of these layers it brings a crispy test
 bich ke hisse main masaalon ke mishran vaala aalu hota he jo is samose kaa swaad badhata he
 This samosa is served with Pindi Chole and Gourd (ghee) pickle, which enhances its flavor

 Shop owner Umesh Kumar stated that "he never asked his ancestors about the name of Japanese samosa
" "ek ke baad ek peedi ise aage badhaate hue aa rahi he or ab chauthi peedi ne kaam sambhaal liya he
 It seems that Umesh ji's tau (lala Manohar Shah) must have been very impressed with the Japanese layer fan so that he tried to get a glimpse of Japan in the Hindustani dish too

 While showing a clip of his Japanese samosa printed in a Japanese newspaper, Umesh Kumar says that the Indian-style flavored samosa, which is called Pardesi, is popular even in Japan
 japan se sailaani bhi ise khaane zarur aate he
 But one thing has to be said - "the name may be foreign, but the flavor is completely native!"
