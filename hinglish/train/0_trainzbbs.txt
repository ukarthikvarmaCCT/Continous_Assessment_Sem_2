 "in the next five years, 70 lakhs promise to the people of Uttar Pradesh to create employment and self-employment opportunities
 mitron, uttar pradesh main sthapit har udyog main 90 pratishat naukariyaan uttar pradesh ke yuvaaon ko hi milen, ham sunishchit karte hai
 Friends, the process to recruit all vacant government posts will be started within 90 days of forming the government
 
 
 "yah bayaan amit shah kaa he, jo unhone lakhanu main BJP kaa ghoshnaptr jari karte hue diya tha
 In January 2017, Amit Shah was reading his statement from the BJP manifesto
 ek saal baad disambar, 2018 main madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri kamalnath aisa hi ek bayaan dete hai
 "A lot of people get into industry, come from other states, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, i don't want to criticize them, but the youth of Madhya Pradesh are deprived of employment
 70 pratishat rojgaar local hoga
 
 
 "read the statement of both of you carefully
 kya aapkaa dhyaan uttar pradesh, bihar vaale hisse par hi jaataa he? uttar pradesh or bihar se duusare rajyon main rojgaar kii talash main nikalne vaale yuvaaon ko kis par gussa aata hoga? zaahir he, unheen netaaon par, jo in dinon unke champion banane kii nautanki kar rahe hai
 It is not that young people from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh migrate, there is also migration from Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 hamen is sawaal ko do staron par dekhnaa hoga
 What will affect the federal nature of India by reserving 70 to 90 percent of jobs in the name of endemism, that structure is not just in the building of institutions, but also in the minds of people
 kya aisa din aane vaala he ki ham donald trump ke america kii tarah rajyon ke bich cement kii oonchi deevaaren banaaenge, taaki koi duusare rajya main na ja sake
 Then you also calculate the actual employment status and the institutions associated with them
 amit shah ne uttar pradesh ke udyogon main 90 pratishat naukari sthaneey yuvaaon ko dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 Did the youth of Uttar Pradesh get better? Were the people of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh killed by that decision? How many such factories or companies have been set up in Uttar Pradesh after the formation of BJP government, in which 90 percent of the youth of Uttar Pradesh have got employment? Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated Samsung's factory in Noida, give an account of whether 90 percent of the local youth got employment or not
 vaise hamane uttar pradesh kii audyogic niti kaa bhi adhyayan kiya, 90 pratishat rojgaar sthaneey yuvaaon ko dene kii baat nazar nahin ai
 It is common to forget manifestos
 varsh 2012 main shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha tha ki udyogon ko 50 pratishat rojgaar sthaneey yuvaaon ko dena hoga
 Those who give up to 90 percent will get two years of tax exemption
 kya madhya pradesh kii sarkaar bataa sakati he ki is niti ke baad kitne aise udyog aae, jisamen sthaneey yuvaaon ko 50 pratishat rojgaar mila? koi tathy rakh sakati he, jisase is faisle ke asar kii behatar samiksha ho sake? yah aankada sankhya main diya jaae, pratishat main nahin
 Can the new Chief Minister Kamal Nath put a white paper on these facts in front of the public? If you search on the Internet, you will get many news related to the policy or scheme of giving 70 to 90 percent jobs to local youth in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Goa and Himachal Pradesh
 ab zaraa har rajya main sarkari naukariyon kii bhartee prakriya or isse judi sansthaaon kaa bhi hisaab kar lete hai
 Is the Public Service Selection Commission of Uttar Pradesh honest and transparent to the youth of its state, is it the Commission of Bihar, is Madhya Pradesh's business? Look at their record of hiring
 bahut si naukariyaan to aisi hai, jinka vigyaapan niklaa, form fees ke naam par karodon rupee vasule gaye or us pariksha kaa pataa hi nahin chalaa
 The examinations that have taken place are also caught in the cycle of rigging to delays and litigation
 amit shah bataa den ki vaade ke anusaar 90 dinon main uttar pradesh main kitne padon ko bharne kii prakriya aarambh hui? vah prakriya kitne dinon main puri ho rahi he, yah bhi bataa den
 Not only Amit Shah, Nitish Kumar, Amarinder Singh, Mamta Banerjee, tell everyone
 abhi isi saal uttar pradesh sarkaar ne kareeb 68,000 sahaayak adhyapakon kii bhartee nikaali
 It was rigged in this test
 jise top karnaa tha, use fail kar diya gaya or fail karne vaale paas kar die gaye
 When the court checked the copy, Ankit Verma topper came out while it was failed
 yahi nahin, akhilesh yadav kii sarkaar main 68,000 shikshakon kii bahaali nikali
 The process was completed, but the new government stayed the name of the review
 adaalat ke kai adeshon ke baad inhen naukari dene ke liye kaha gaya, to bhi naukari nahin di gai
 The youth had to do countless picketing for jobs from their own state
 abhi bhi kai hazaar yuvaaon ko naukari nahin mili
 i have done more than 50 episodes on the youth troubled by these selection commissions in the 'prime Time' job series
 aaj bhi kar rahaa hum, bas, ab episod kii ginati band kar di he
 If you want, you can independently audit all the episodes
 balki main chahta hum ki koi naukari series or uske asar kaa swatantra audit kare
 During this series, more than 30,000 students have received appointment letters, who had to wait year after year even after the results came out
 yah sankhya bhi antim nahin he, kyonki maine 30,000 ke baad ginati band kar di
 i did not even make this success a means to beat myself or my channel
 doosraa koi channel hota, to din-raat yahi chalata he ki hamaara asar, 30,000 ko mila niyuktipatr
 i do not have this habit
 jab bhi promo team ai, unhen yahi samajhaayaa ki main aisa nahin chahta hum
 If the promo runs, i will not be able to lift this load
 kyonki ek episod ke saath saikadon nahin, hazaron naujavaanon ke massej aa jate the ki hamaari bhartee kii samasya dikhaa den
 That is also why i could not celebrate my success, because at the time when the news of the impact was there, weeping messages of troubled youth also started coming
 har pariksha kii kahani bhayaavah he
 The youngsters lost their lives and ruined their lives
 noujvaan phone kar baqayada rote hai
 Such messages have come even today, when i am writing this article
 ek saal ho gaya, lekin main is naukari series ke chakra se nahin nikal sakaa
 My condition is that in every episode, i have to say that i cannot show everyone the problem related to the job, because i do not have the resources
 reporter nahin hai
 And indeed there are so many problems that i could not show everyone, so i could not beat my drummer, because the suffering of the next was more urgent and severe than my applause
 in naujavaanon ko media or sarkaron ne fail kiya he
 The gimmick that is going on in the name of the debate about Uttar Pradesh, Bihar is just a day's drama
 aaj subah hi massej aayaa ki uttar pradesh main teen saal se daaroga kii bhartee kii pariksha puri nahin ho saki he
 a year ago, the Uttar Pradesh Police Recruitment Board canceled the examination of the computer operator, till now that examination is not known when it will happen again
 uttar pradesh lok seva ayog ne 2013 main ejiniyaron ke liye form nikaala
 He was tested in 2016, but the result is not known till date

 For fast track courts, 1,950 people were to be placed on three-year contracts
 saat maheene pehle riselt aa gaya, magar abhi tak kisi kii jwining nahin hui
 It is also significant that this situation belongs to the fast track courts
 yah isliye bataaya ki naukari kii samasya ko lekar meri talkhi vaazib he
 It is not of pretense
 rajya sarkaar kaa chhodie, centre sarkaar kaa bhi vahi haal he
 See the track record of the Staff Selection Commission
 SSC CHSL 2016 kii pariksha paas karne ke baad 614 naujavaanon ko military ejineering services main jwining nahin ho rahi thi
 The result was arrived on February 16, 2018
 paanch maheene baad inhen cmand kaa aavanton hua, magar uske baad bhi niyuktipatr kaa pataa nahin chalaa
 February to September arrived, these young men of ordinary houses came to Delhi and wandered
 12 sitambar ke 'prime Time' main hamane inaki vyathaa dikhaai
 From the Ministry of Defense to these offices, these young men were tired of traveling
 us vakt rakshaamantri ne twitor par likhaa tha ki ham pataa lagaate hai
 Nothing happened for three months
 teen rajyon main haarane ke baad in sabko niyuktipatr bheja ja rahaa he
 Even after getting a job for 10 months, these youth were wandering on the streets without salary
 naujavaanon ke saath is tarah kii dhokhadhadi turant band honi chahie
 The job question is not a gimmick
 uttar pradesh, bihar ke naujavaanon ko bhi bhavuk hone kii zarurat nahin he
 The youth of other states also work like them
 jitani mehnat bihar ke yuva karte hai, utani hi maharashtra ke yuva bhi karte hai
 Everyone should see together when the governments will stop cheating on them
 yah dekhnaa chahie ki jab ve apane rajya ke bhartee board kii badmaashiyon ke khilaaf sangharsh karte hai, tab koun netaa unke saath khadaa hota he
 Before getting into this sentimentality, one must count the number of demonstrations and demonstrations regarding recruitment
 privet sector kii naukariyon kaa bura haal he
 Worse still, government sector jobs
 naukariyaan ghatai ja rahi hai
 Those which are not being given on time
 sarkaron ke paas kitni naukariyaan hai, vah bhi real time main jaanane kaa hamaare paas koi tarika nahin he
 So for me this question is not about the sentimentality of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, it is a question of hoping for a better system
 kya congress kii sarkarein kuch alag karengi? kya BJP kii sarkarein ab se kuch behatar karengi? Five to 5 in the current financial year

 He said that inflation, especially food inflation, remains a challenge for the government
 arthvyavastha kii sthiti ke sandarbh main chidambaram ne kaha, ab halaat sudhaarney ke sanket dikh rahe hai
 It will accelerate and the economy will pick up pace

 megaster amitabh bachchan kaa twitor handle somvaar ko hack ho gaya
 Hackers have put a photo of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on the profile photo of his Twitter handle
 iske alaava baio bhi badal diya gaya he, jisamen lav pakistan likhaa he
 At the moment it is not clear who hacked Big B's Twitter handle
 lekin iske peeche pakistan samarthit havers kaa haath ho saktaa he
 Amitabh Bachchan is very active on social media
 aae din ve twitor ke jariye apane vichaar logon ke saath saajha kiya karat hai
 Through social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram, Amitabh keeps his fans updated with his every activity
 unke twitor acount ke hack ho jane ke baad unke phens or soshal media par yah baat teji se fail gai he
 Recently, Amitabh Bachchan's secretary Sheetal Jain died
 amitabh ke filmi kariyar main unke secretary sheethal jain kaa bhi bahut bada haath rahaa he
 He was with Big b from the beginning of his film career
 big bi ne apane aadhikarik blog par apane secretary sheethal jain ke naam sandesh bhi likhaa tha
 Amitabh Bachchan also shares his poems from time to time through Twitter
 ve bollywood ke un abhinaytaon main se ek hai jo apane phens ke bich kisi na kisi bahaane se hameshaa charchaa main rahete hai
 View this post on instagramwhen he not just wears your shoes, but also shares the same number of chairs to sit on
 
 Then he is not just a son, but your dearest friend !! a post shared byamitabh Bachchan (@amitabhbachchan) onapr 6, 2019 at 12:13 pm PDT Amitabh Bachchan will soon be seen in the movie Brahmastra
 is film main unke saath ranbir kapur or aalia bhatta najar aaengi
 Earlier, Amitabh Bachchan was in discussion about a South Indian movie

 Some people have dreams that they go abroad to study, but sometimes it is not possible due to lack of information and sometimes they have to be deceived
 isliye videsh main padhai karne ke liye jane se pehle hameshaa kuch baton kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie, taaki aapako koi dikkat kaa saamana naa karnaa pade
 
 
 Do research first - Although research is necessary for every study or course, but if you study abroad, more care should be taken
 bataa den ki alag-alag deshon main padhai kaa alag-alag system hota he, isliye vahaan ke pattern aadi ke bare main pehle jaankaree le len
 Then also keep in mind that English is not the main language in many countries, so find it out beforehand
 ejineering nahin kerani he? to 12veen science ke baad karen ye coursecorse kii manyata kii len jaankaree-aap jo bhi course karnaa chaahate hai, uske bare main achche se pard len
 Also keep this in mind why it is better in that country and what institutions are there for it
 saath hi yah videsh main koi bhi program chunane se pehle is baat kii tasdik bhi kar leni chahie ki usase future main kariyar main kya phayda milegaa
 Actually every study done abroad is not good
 manyata kii jaankaree le len-course main admician lene se pehle is baat kaa bhi pataa laga len ki aapane jo course chunaa he, use manyata bhi hasil he yaa nahin
 Keep in mind that studying abroad does not mean that everything will be good there
 jaise hamaare yahaan frod hote hai, vaise hi farji course videshon main bhi kaaphi hote hai
 If you want a national scholarship, then know how to apply - you should not have any problem of funds at the last moment
 khaastaur par jab aapkaa baccha padhai ke liye videsh jane ko bilkul taiyaar ho
 For this you prepare a break-up and add the right expenses while estimating expenses
 america main padhai ke liye bhejne main salanaa 25 -50 lakh rupaye kaa kharch aa saktaa he
 However, it is cheaper in many other countries
 uske aadhaar par hi faisla len

 Good news for those traveling by air
 agar aapke paas kam saamaan he to aapako hawaii jahaaj ke tikaton par nakad discount milegaa
 An English newspaper reported this
 aisa duniya main pehali baar ho rahaa he ki gharelu udaan bharne vaale yatriyon ko aisa discount diya jayega
 Airlines in India are considering giving cash discounts to air travelers who travel without luggage or very little luggage
 yah discount 200 se 300 rupee tak hoga
 The newspaper has reported that the Civil Aviation Department has proposed such a proposal
 vibhaag logon ko kam se kam saamaan lekar chalane ke liye prerit karnaa chahta he
 In fact, a controversy arose when Air Asia started charging passengers for carrying luggage
 yah airlines yatri ke saamaan le jane par unase 15 kilo tak ke liye 199 rupee leti thi jabaki zyaadaatar duusari airlines inke liye charge nahin karti hai
 Later he stopped doing so
 haalanki civil aviation ke adhikariyon ne airlines ko yatriyon se atirikt charge lene se manaa kar diya
 Under this, it is now being encouraged to travel with less luggage
 isi disha main yah prastaav rakhaa gaya he ki bina saamaan ke yatra karne waalon ko discount diya jaae
 Actually, the more weight the aircraft has, the more fuel it drinks
 iske alaava agar airline companiyon ko pehle se isaki jaankaree ho ki kitne yatri kitna saamaan lekar yatra kar rahe hai to ve usee hisaab se petrol bharvaayenge

 After the important revelations of the terrorists caught in Tarn Taran of Punjab, the Punjab Police has now canceled the holidays of all its employees
 punjab main police hai alert par he or agle aadesh tak pulicekarmiyon ko duty par bane rahane ke liye kaha gaya he
 The interrogation of a dozen Khalistani terrorists captured from Tarn Taran in Punjab during the last two weeks has revealed that ISI and Khalistani terrorists were trying to carry out major terrorist acts like 26 / 11 in Punjab
 darasal haal hi main punjab ke tarantaaran main pichley dinon hue blast ke baad ho rahi jaanch main nai jaankaree mili he
 Pakistan's notorious intelligence agency ISI was preparing to carry out 26 / 11 attacks in Punjab and adjoining states
 iske liye iesai ne drone ke jariye punjab main AK-47 or duusare hathiyaaron kii delivery karwaai thi
 Let us tell you that on Sunday, tightening another big screw on the terrorists, Punjab Police has revealed the module of Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF) which is reactivated
 germany se aatanki gatividhi chalaa rahe is aatanki gut ko pakistan se samarthan mil rahaa he
 The group was plotting to carry out a series of terrorist attacks in Punjab and its neighboring states

 Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta said that it is feared that the weapon has recently been sent from the indo-pak border using drones launched by Pakistani Establishment, Pakistan's Intelligence Agency ISI and Pakistan-backed Jihadi and Khalistan-backed terrorist groups 
 giraftaar kiye gaye logon kii pahchaan balavant singh, akashadip singh, harbhajan singh or balbir singh ke rup main kii gai he

 supreme court ne nithari cond ke doshi surendra coli kii faansee kii sajaa kii taamil par ravivaar der raat ek hafte tak roak laga di
 Preparations were on to hang Koli in Meerut jail on 12 September
 lekin, sheersh adaalat kii ore se jari aadesh ke baad coli kii faansee tal gai
 Let you know in a systematic way how this work was done that day
 ravivaar yani 7 sitambar kii shaam hote:hote achaanak meerut ke central jail se ek khabar udati he
 The news is that Nithari's criminal Saraendra Koli is being hanged on Monday morning
 chunki ravivaar kaa din tha lihaaza court band
 In such a situation, the well-known lawyer Indira Jaising asks for a time to meet the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court on Sunday night
 iske baad raat kareeb 10:45 baje supreme court ke ek senior justise ke ghar par special adaalat baithti he
 And then at 4:30 am, Meerut Central Jail is told to stop Koli's execution for 7 days
 7 sitambar 2014ravivaarrat ke qareeb 9
 By 30 am, suddenly there is news that it is quite possible that on Monday morning, the convict Surendra Koli of Nithari can be hanged
 pichley kuch dinon se vaise hi media main lagaataar coli kii faansee ko lekar atakalein bani hui thim
 But this time the news was serious
 desh kii sari adaalaton main ravivaar kii chuttee thi
 Supreme Court also closed
 yani faansee rokane kaa koi upaay nahin
 The news of Koli being hanged on Monday morning also reaches the ears of Indira Jaising, the former Additional Solicitor General of the country
 indira jaisingh surendra coli ko insaaf kaa ek or mauka die jane ke haq main hai
 She wants her case to be heard once more in open court as per law before Surendra Koli is hanged
 lihaaza khabar milte hi wo fouran supreme court ke cheef justise aaram lodha se milane kaa vaqt maangati hai
 For this, she calls the registrar of the Supreme Court
 ek to ravivaar kaa din
 The court is closed and it is already night
 aise main cheef justise tak apni baat pahunchane kaa sirf or sirf ek hi rasta tha
 That is to either call them or send a message through a special messenger to their house
 indira jaisingh kii gujarish par register unka paigaam chif justise tak pahunchaate hai
 Hearing the message, Justice Lodha, who is sitting on the highest chair of justice, orders the special hearing of the case at night
 justise lodha is khaas sunwaayee ke liye usee vakt supreme court ke do sabase senior jaj justise echel dattu or justise eaar dave kii ek special bench banaate hai or maamle kii sunwaayee unke hawaale kar dete hai
 7 of September 2014 Sunday 11
 45 bajechif justise kaa aadesh milte hi raat kareeb 11:45 baje justise echel dattu ke ghar par special court lagati he
 In front of this special court, Indira Jaisingh Koli requests to be given another chance of justice before she is hanged
 jaisingh daleel detii hai ki supreme court ke constitution bench ke ek aadesh ke mutabik faansee ke aise maamalon main jinamein rivyuu pitishan bhi khaarij kiya ja chukaa ho, mujrim ko faansee par latakaae jane se pehle open court main uske maamle kii ek baar or sunwaayee kii ja sakati he
 Therefore, Surendra Koli should also be given one more hearing before his death according to this rule
 ye maamla isliye bhi behad gambhir he, kyonki supreme court pehle hi uske deth warrant par dastakhat kar chuki he or is maamle kii sunwaayee main ek pal bhi deree kaa matlab he ki coli ko kabhi bhi faansee ke fande par lataka diya ja saktaa he
 The night was passing and the debate was on
 kareeb ghante bhar tak ye special adaalat chalati rahi
 After this, the bench of Justice Dattu and Justice Dave gives its decision after hearing the arguments of Indira Jaisingh
 8 sitambar 2014somvaarrat ke 12
 At 45 o'clock the clock had 15 minutes left
 sunwaayee khatm hote-hote ek ghante kaa vaqt guzar chukaa tha
 The date of the calendar had changed, along with the clock needles
 thik tabhi special adaalat apana faisla sunaati he
 In the case of Surendra Koli, Koli's execution is also banned for a week, giving Indira Jaising a week's time for a second hearing
 par abhi isse bhi ahm or najuk kaam baaki tha
 To deliver the court verdict to the officials of Meerut at the right time
 wo bhi kanoonee tareeke se
 Hence DM and SSP are called first in Meerut
 unhen neend se jagaakar coli kii faansee par agle hafte tak roak kii khabar di jaati he
 They are also asked to ink the fax of the written order of this order
 8 sitambar 2014somvaarrat ke 3
 45 pm Special court order had reached the DM and SSP of Meerut in the form of fax
 donon ne special bench ko fax mil jane kii tasadeeq kii
 8 September 2014 Monday 4 of the morning
 30 bajehi wo vakt tha jab meerut jail ke jailer ko supreme court ke aadesh kii likhit copy mili
 By then, the DM and SSP had informed the Supreme Court's order to stop the hanging of Koli for seven days to the jailer over the phone

 Negotiations have begun between Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and BJP national president Amit Shah
 lekin is baatcheet main abhi bhi kisi ne khulkar apane pattey nahi khole hai
 It is agreed in both the parties that together they will contest the elections, but how many seats will be agreed, what will be the seat sharing formula so that everyone can contest elections in a respectful manner, there is definitely a lot of uneasiness about it
 maujuuda paristhiti ke mutabik bihar kii kul 40 siton main se 22 par bijepi ke sitting empi hai
 After that nda's constituent Ram Vilas Paswan's party has 6 seats and Upendra Kushwaha's party has three seats
 kul milakar 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main endie ne 40 siton main se 31 siton par apana kabja jamaaya tha
 In 2014, JDU got just 2 seats
 ab jab jediu bhi endie kaa hissaa he to siton kii sankhya badhkar 33 ho gai he
 There are only 7 seats which the opposition has
 aise main in 7 siton or 2 jiti hui siton ko mila diya jaae to jediu 9 siten to kisi bhi tarah se paa sakati he
 But he is trying to get more seats than this
 jediu 2013 main bijepi se alag hone se pehle bihar kii 40 siton main se 25 par chunaav ladi thi or bijepi ko 15 siton se hi santosh karnaa padaa tha, lekin 2014 ke modi lahar main desh ke saath-saath bijepi bihar main bhi majboot hui
 In such a situation, JDU will not be able to get the former position
 haal hi mennithish kumaarane kaha ki bade bhai or chote bhai kii koi baat nahin he, ham endie main hai or milakar chunaav ladenge
 He gave these hints at the meeting of the National Executive held in Delhi
 jediu ke netaaon kaa maananaa he ki aisi paristhiti main bijepi or jediu 15-15 siton par chunaav lade or das siten ramvilas paswan or kushvaha kii party ko mili
 However, the BJP may not be ready for this, as it has 22 seats
 bijepi do teen siton se zyada kii qurbaani nahin de sakati he
 In such a situation, JDU may get 11 or 12 seats
 charchaa ke mutabik darbhanga or munger kii siten jediu le sakati he, haalanki munger kii seat lokjanshkti party(algepi) ke khate main he
 RJD may get an attack on Nitish, Kumar had left with the grand alliance on the issue of corruption
 ab jabaki wo endie ke saath aa gaye hai or pehali vaali sthiti se unki takat agar endie main kam aanki jaaegi to argedy ko nitish par nishaanaa lagane kaa mauka mil jaayegaa
 In such a situation, Nitish Kumar's party can save its face by talking about contesting more seats than BJP in the assembly elections
 haalanki jaankaar maanate hai ki nitish kumaar ne khud is maamle ko lekar thodaa naram rukh apanaaya he
 JDU leaders can also say that they are getting 12 seats instead of 2 seats

 bharat main pichley dinonuniversal basic inakam (ubiai)ko lekar kaaphi charchaa hai thi
 Regarding this, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said that the Government of India can give UBI of Rs 2600 per person every year if desired
 haalanki yah tab hi sambhav he jab sarkaar khaadya or urja sabsidi khatm kar de
 The IMF said this in its 'fiscal Monitor - Tackling Inequality' report
 deni hogi khaadya sabsidi kii aahutibharat main universal basic inakam ko lekarmepane report main vistaar se charchaa kii he
 The calculation set by the IMF to extract UBI is based on the data of 2011-12
 aise main agar sarkaar ubiai apnaane kaa faisla leti he, to use desh main maujuuda samay main chal rahe sabsidi package ko lekar vichaar-vimarsh karnaa hoga or nae sire se nitiyaan banani hongi
 3% burden on GDP
 IMF has said that the financial cost of providing such a low UBI will be 3% of GDP
 haalanki isse saarvajanik khaadya vitaran or eendhan par di jane vaali sabsidi khatm ho jaaegi
 Arvind Subrahmanyam has supported
 Universal Basic Income was widely discussed in India
 coraporates ne kaha tha ki ubiai dene se sarkari khajaane par boj pad padegaa
 At the same time, it was supported by Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian
 unhone kaha tha ki ubiai ek aisa 'vichaar he jiskaa vakt shaayad aa gaya he
 Not for quick execution, but at least for serious public deliberations
 'aarthik survey main is par charchaa kaa suzav diya gayisi saal farvari main aarthik survey main ubiai ko lekar vistaar se charchaa kii gai
 It said that UBI would cost between 4 and 5 per cent of GDP
 subrahmanyam ne report main kaha ki ubiai ek or yojana nahin hogi balki evji yojana hogi
 Actually this will be the only scheme in which the beneficiary will get the money directly
 garibon ke liye phydemandarvind ne kaha tha ki koi 950 yojanaayen or upyojanaayen hai jin par jidipi kaa 5 fisadi kharch hota he
 Of these, the biggest 11 schemes only account for 50 per cent of the total amount
 in yojanaon ke baavjood sabase garib janon ko phayda nahin ho paata

 Earlier, he (tejashwi Yadav) had said in a tweet that Mane-man Modi ji uncle Nitish ji does not know what to say
 Suppose you are asking? By the way, will the two be together tomorrow? Hope the DN report will be exchanged
 bataa den ki varsh 2015 main bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan piem modi ne nitish kumaar par hamalaa karte hue unke diene par sawaal khadey kiye
 Later, PM Modi also faced severe criticism
 us dauraan piem modi ke prayek bhaashan ke baad nitish kumaar or lalu prasad kii press conference bhi kam rochak nahin hoti thi jahaan aaropon kaa silsilewar tareeke se jawaab diya jaataa tha
 The election rally in Bihar started with a blatant charge of Narendra Modi
 nitish kumaar ke DNA (modi ke anusaar raajnneetik) par sawaal uthaate hi bihari asmita par sawaal khadaa kar diya gaya tha
 Nitish Kumar said that this is an insult to Biharis
 nitish ne ek website banaakar narendra modi ko khulaa khat likhaa tha or kaha tha ki modi ko apane shabd waapas lene honge
 On this issue, spokespersons of both the parties jumped into the ground to defend their respective sides
 gaya ke bhaashan main to piem modi ne bihar ko 'bimaaru' rajya kaa darja de diya tha
 However, statistics show that Bihar has now come out of this status
 nitish kumaar ne baqayada press conference kar is par apana paksh rakhaa tha or modi ke bhaashan par kadi pratikriya jataai thi
 The pm's statement about DNA had hurt the BJP in the state while the Grand Alliance had benefited
 bataa den ki piem ke aise vivaadit bayaan se bijepi ko sirf bihar main hi nuksaan nahin hua tha
 Earlier in Delhi too, Arvind Kejriwal got sympathy with such statements of PM
 bijepi lok sabha ke saath kuch vidhansabhaon ke chunaav jeet kar ai thi

 Yoga is derived from the Sanskrit word 'UG'
 yoga shabd kaa shabdic arth- judana yaa milanaa hota he
 Yoga provides immense benefits to health
 ye dil sambandhi beemaari se dur rakhane kaa ek behtareen vikalp he
 Doing yoga regularly brings peace to the mind and reduces stress
 lekin yoga karte samay kuch baaten dhyaan main rakhana behad jaruri hota he
 Keep these things in mind while doing yoga: Punctuality - Try to arrive 10 minutes ahead of time for your yoga class
 isse aap apane liye sahi jagah ko chun sakenge
 Apart from this, you can try different types of Yogasan in the time before the start of class
 class shuru hone se 2-3 ghante pehle tak kuch naa khaaen-yoga karne se lagbhag 2 se 3 ghante pehle tak kuch bhi khaane se bachein
 Because if you do yoga after eating food, you may feel body cramps
 ji michala saktaa he or ulti bhi aa sakati he
 Actually, the body takes a lot of energy to digest food, due to which you can feel tired while doing yoga
 dil kii dushman he jarurat se zyada neend, aa saktaa he heart atempani chot se sambadhit jaankaree apni yoga teacher ko den-agar aapke sharir main kisi tarah kii koi chot ho or aapako yoga kii kisi bhi mudra ko karne main takalif mahasoos hoti he to isaki jaankaree apane yoga teacher ko jarur den
 Do not take mobile in class - while doing yoga it is important that you remove all your attention from other things and concentrate only on your yoga asana
 mobile ko class main lekar naa jaaen
 Because it will distract your attention
 class main baat naa karen-yun to apni class ke logon se baat karnaa ek acchhee aadat hoti he
 But in yoga class, talk as little as possible
 kyonki isse aapkaa dhyaan to bhatakegaa hi saath hi baaki log bhi apane yoga main dhyaan nahin de paaenge
 Keep towels with you - Take towels or handkerchiefs with you in yoga class
 taaki pasinaa aane par aap paseene ko saaf kar saken
 Do not do yoga asanas in much enthusiasm - do not try to force any Mudra by getting excited
 isse aapke sharir main anthan ho sakati he
 Rather, try to take time slowly
 khatarnaak ho gai he dilli kii hawa, khaane main shaamil karen ye chijenclass main samay se pehle jaaen-kisi bhi kaary ko sahi dhang se karne ke liye samay kaa paband hona jaruri hota he
 Therefore, go to yoga class ahead of time and leave the class only after the end of the class, so that no one else gets in trouble because of you
 class ke baad sabhi mudraon ko doharaaen-agar aap jald se jald yoga main khud ko parfect karnaa chaahate hai to ghar aakar khaali samay main sabhi mudraon ko phir se tri karen
 Write down the important things from them and keep them with you
 samay-samay in points ko padhate rahen
 So that you do not forget what you learned

 jidipi samet anya aarthik aankadon kii vajah se vipaksh kii aalochana jhel rahi narendra modi sarkaar ke saamne ek nai mushkil khadi ho gai he
 In fact, the latest report by the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) states that the unemployment rate in the country is at the highest level of 3 years
 report yah bhi kahati he ki log rojgaar kii talash kar rahe hai lekin unhen niraashaa haath lag rahi he
 Unemployment rate in August 8

 iske mutabik maheene ke har hafte main berogari kii dar 8 se 9 fisadi ke bich rahi
 a month earlier in July, the weekly unemployment rate was between 7 and 8 percent

 The report further states that 9 in the urban unemployment rate in August month

 According to the report, labor participation rate has increased marginally in August

 35 per cent which is 42 in October 2018
 46 fisadi par thi
 The report says that the labor participation rate is rising due to the shock of demonetisation and GST, but this is not found in the employment rate data
 report ke mutabik log rojgaar kii talash to kar rahe hai lekin unhen niraashaa haath lag rahi he
 This sign is the alarm bell
 aarthik susti kii vajah se ja rahi naukariyandrasal, desh main aarthik susti kaa maahaul he
 Due to this, there are reports of layoffs in almost every sector
 bataa den ki beete kuch maheenon main desh ke automobile sector main 2 lakh se adhik naukariyaan chali gai hai
 Similarly, the textiles sector, FMCG sector and real estate sector are also facing a crisis of jobs
 pakistan main sainya chhavnee vaale shahar rawalpindi main general headquarters (jiechakue) main 2014 kii garmiyon kii ek raat prashansakon kii bheed ne ghani muunchon vaale pakistani sena ke 15wein sena pramukh raahil sharif ko gher liya
 That day was Defense Day
 sena abhi musharraf daur ke rajnatik atapatepan or kayaani daur vaale aatanki khataron ke pratibandhon kii khol se dhire-dhire baahar aana shuru kar rahi thi
 The public parade, in which a select few could talk to top officers, was being resumed after a blockade of over a decade
 vahaan se kareeb 40 minute kii drive kii duuri par islamabad main vipakshi netaa imran khan chunaav sudhaaron kii maang ko lekar dharne par baithe hue the
 Imran hoped that thousands of people would gather in his strike and a situation like Tahrir Square would arise, after which Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif would have to bow to pressure and be forced to resign
 jiechakue ke aalaa general is baat par bante hue the ki unhen us sarkaar kaa paksh lenaa chahie jo sena ko naapsand karti he yaa vipaksh kaa saath dena chahie jisane uskaa samarthan kiya tha
 At the time when the crowd around Raheel was not taking the name of retrenchment and there was a wave of selfies with the general, at the same time, a tall man with a wide shoulder standing at a short distance, standing with short height of soldiers There was a habit of listening to things
 vah apana ek haath peeche modakar duusare haath main sena kii chadi se apane pair par dhire-dhire thapki de rahaa tha
 The man was none other than Lieutenant General Qamar Javed Bajwa, the then Commander of Pakistan's largest Military Formation x Corps
 jiechakue ke parade maidan main tamaam logon ke vipareet bajva kisi celibrity kii tarah bheed se ghire raahil sharif kii taraf nahin, balki kaale grenite se bane shaheedon ke smarak ko nihaar rahe the
 That night and for a few months to come, there was also a reason for Bajwa to stand alone in isolation from such a crowd
 jiechakue main ve aise kuch hi logon main ek the jo islamabad main chal rahe grih kalah jaise halaat ke samay loktantr or chuni hui sarkaar ko banaae rakhane kii salaah de rahe the or 111 brigade kii takat ko philhal haashiye par rakhane ke himachati the
 However, he was removed from the post of chief of x Corps and sent to the post of simple responsibility in office
 phir bhi ve sena pramukh ke sachivalay se judi star jaisi haisiyat ke khilaaf the or unhen bas unke kuch kareebi dost sahakarmi hi jaanate the
 But eventually his reputation for favoring democracy worked and a fourth star was added to his uniform, that is, he became the most powerful post on the land of Pakistan
 saal bhar se kuch zyada samay tak is pad par rahane or ek gaiyr-rajnatik sena pramukh kii pratishtha hasil karne kii koshish ke baad mulk ke sabase bade sainik adhikari rajnatik vivaadon ke bhavar main funs gaye hai
 When the country is preparing for the third historic general election without any military or judicial impediment, only then Pakistan has been banned by the US and further restrictions can be imposed, due to which in its relationship with America Bitterness has arrived
 aise main general bajva or unki 6 lakh javaanon kii fouj—jise desh kaa sabase taqatvar sanghathan mana jaataa he—bachaav kii mudra main maaloom padate hai haalanki ve teji se apni khoi hui haisiyat paane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The National Security Plan "bajwa Doctrine" of this 57-year-old infantry officer of the Baloch Regiment has become the subject of a huge controversy that marks a rift between civilians and military in Pakistan
 yah vivaad aise samay aayaa he jab pakshpatpurna raajnneeti or desh main sakriy nyaaypalika or sattarudh—lekin sena-virdohi—sharif ke shashan tantra or naukarshahi va media main unke sahyogiyon ke bich takaraav chal rahaa he
 In July last year, the army was believed to be the hand behind Sharif's departure from the Supreme Court of Pakistan
 sena par yah aarope sharif kheme kii ore se prachaarit kiya gaya tha
 But the military — which has ruled directly for three decades out of the seven decades since independence — strongly refutes this charge
 lekin 16 maheene tak lagaataar pakistani media ke nishaanon ne bachane ke baad bajva ne march main patrakaron se anadhikarik rup se baat karke ek nai par galat shuruyaat kii
 Neither the secrecy of this conversation nor its sensitivity could be maintained
 jaldi hi ek ke baad ek stanbhakaar ne is chaar sitaron vaale sainik adhikari kii baatcheet ko puri tarah se saarvajanik kar diya
 Normalizing relations with India, not succumbing to US pressure in the case of Afghanistan, bringing jihadis into electoral politics, mainstreaming economy, loopholes in constitution, crisis of Sharif's family, support of some cabinet ministers , And politically burning issues like the Army's full support to the judiciary were the subject of discussion and they were called Bajwa Doctors As was seen
 iske baad is baatcheet ke parinaam saamne aa gaye, sampadakeey lekhon main isaki aalochana kii gai
 There was a lot of debate in social media
 pakistan ke vampanth se sena ke aalochak maidan main aa gaye
 Bajwa was described as biased and criticized for going out of his purview
 lekin ek aise desh main jahaan sena ko logon kaa bharpoor samarthan hasil rahaa he (2017 ke galop survey ke mutabik, sena ko 79 pratishat logon kaa samarthan hasil he) jab bajva kii bharat se sambandhit ranneeti—kashmir ke mudde ko nafrat-aatank yaa jang se hal na karnaa—par charchaa hui or lagbhag puri tarah se uski tarif kii gai to uske baad sena ne 23 march ko pakistan de kii parade main bharat ke dephence atashe or dakshin block ke duusare mehmaanon ko aamantrit kiya
 This is the first time to do so for the Pakistan Army, which has fought three wars with India
 interservices intelligence (iesai) diarectoret ke purv major general isbandiyaar pataudi jo bajva ke saath lambey samay tak kaam kar chuke hai kehete hai, "sena pramukh vyaavhaarik raajnneeti kii gahari samaj rakhte hai or unhone kshetreey ranneeti banane or ati kshetreey partneron se zyada padosiyon ke ranneeti banane main iskaa behatar tareeke se istemaal kiya he
 "unusually liberal forces in the media — the Jung group has been at the forefront and whose newspapers and broadcasts have been banned in the cantonments run by the military soon after this doctrine was exposed (bajwa's move)
" Has support) praised the general
 stanbhakaar suhail varich ne 70 varshon ke ugr rashtrawaad ko darkinar karne or pakistan ko padosiyon ke saath shanti sthapit karne par jor dene vaale vyaavhaarikta ke siddhant kii taraf le jane ke liye bajva ko dhanyavad diya
 But not everyone was happy with it
 soshal media ne bajva kii theory par kadaa rukh apanaaya
 They plan to attempt to bring heavily armed and well-trained radical elements into the mainstream before being forced to go underground under this theory
 pataudi farmaate hai, "kattarpathiyon ko mukhyadhara main laane kaa galat matlab nahin nikaalnaa chahie ki aatankwaadiyon ko raajnneeti main laayaa ja rahaa he
 
 
 It is important that those who hold radical views should also get an opportunity for political expression
 mumkin he, aisa karne se ve hinsa kaa rasta chhod den
 "given the old record of military rule in Pakistan, some people have doubts about the military's intentions
" general headquarters main meet and greet kaarykram main aamantrit ek tivi anker kaa kahana he, "aisa laga jaise ham ekadam nae badshaah se mil rahe the
 According to him, looking at his body language and self-confidence, it seemed as if a king who wanted to make the necessary improvements would probably stay for some time even after retirement
 lekin bajva kaa tantra is baat ko doharaata he ki ve gaiyr-rajnatik sainik adhikari rahe hai or sena puraa bharosa dilaati he ki aam chunaav apane nirdhaarit samay par honge jo garmiyon ke ant main ho sakate hai
 Although he has been one of the few lieutenant generals who cautioned his predecessor against military takeover during the 2014 turmoil, the Dawn newspaper noted the weakness of the democratic process and its doctrine in politically sensitive times
 It was criticized in its editorial: "the move towards democracy is moving towards the third consecutive general election in time
 Received, but Democratic plans are in danger in any forms
 is tarah kii anischitata ke daur main kisi sena pramukh kii tippanee ko loktantr kii vaidhaniktaa par sawaal uthaane ke taur par dekha ja saktaa he
 "ever since the controversy started, the army has responded with these announcements:" Bajwa doctrine "is related to security, not politics at all
 pataudi bajva kii aalochana ko khaarij karte hai
 He says, "he is a very mature person in giving advice to policy-makers and does not want to earn his promotion or his name
" pakistan ke saamne bahut si samasyaayein hai or kisi na kisi ko mushkil sawaal poochne kii jarurat he
 General Bajwa is raising the same questions
 '' yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki is mulk main loktantr or sena ke rishte aage kaise rahete hai

 Sheikh Hasina is also planning foreign trips with special purposes, but she will be able to stay out of peace only when she, like Modi, leaves by making strong arrangements at home

 In these meetings, the minister will inform the spokespersons about their actions and the spokespersons will also work to give their opinion to the ministers
 dilli or bihar main buree tarah haarane ke baad bijepi kaa maananaa he ki is eksrasij se party ko phayda hoga
 Sources said that with this initiative of the party, the spokesperson will be more able to answer questions related to any minister
 isse ve sarkaar ke kaaryon ko sahi tareeke se saamne rakh paaenge or virodhiyon ke hamalon kaa jawaab bhi de paaenge
 The party's Good Governance Cell has initiated this initiative

 aam nagarikon ko bhale hi kol drop kii kathinaayee kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa ho lekin ab saansadon ko sansad ke andar is takalif kaa saamana nahin karnaa padegaa
 For a short time, a mobile tower has been erected in the complex as a temporary solution to this problem
 isse pehle suraksha kaarnon se aitihaasik sansadeey complex main mobile tower kii maang ko khaarij kar diya gaya tha
 But the government had to give up after the ever increasing complaints of mps
 tippaniyanyah bhi padhein - kol drop par hoicourt kaa faisla The problem of poor connectivity in Parliament House was raised in the Lok Sabha last week
 maharashtra kii saansad supriya sule ne kharaab thriji sarvice kii taraf dhyaan khinchaa tha
 Replying to these complaints, Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the heritage and security aspect of this 88-year-old building also needs to be seen
 mobile tower ko ek gaadi ke upar khadaa kiya gaya he, iske alaava ek atirikt tower bhi rakhaa gaya he
 Not only mps, journalists reporting from Parliament also face the problem of poor connectivity
 sutron kaa kahana he ki mobile tower se kam se kam sansad bhawan ke andar to kol drop kii samasya dur ho sakegi

 pakistan ke pashchimottar kabyli kshetra main guuruuvaar ko america drone hamale main aatankwaadi sanghathan alqaida se jude hakkaani network kaa ek sadsy maaraa gaya
 According to news channel 'geo TV', a US drone aircraft attacked the terrorists' hideout in Dandi Darpakhel area of north Waziristan, bordering Afghanistan
 is hamale main hakkaani network ke sadsy jameel sahit chaar log maare gaye
 Jamil used to deal with the logistics of the Haqqani network but was not a member of the Haqqani family
 samachar agency sinhua ke mutabik jameel ke maare jane kii abhi aadhikarik pushti nahin kii gai he

 Opposition parties have renewed mobilization for the meeting of Chief Ministers convened on Sunday for the redesign of the Planning Commission
 pradhanmantri nivas par hone vaali ye baithak do hisson main hogi
 In the first session, the Prime Minister will hear the suggestions of the Chief Ministers about the new Commission and in the second session other issues will be discussed
 vipakshi ekta kii pahal congress ne kii he
 The Congress has reservations about how the Prime Minister announced the abolition of the Planning Commission from Red Fort without consulting the state governments
 congress shasit rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ne iske baad pradhanmantri ko patr likh kar virodh bhi jataayaa tha or kaha tha ki ye sangheey dhaanche ke khilaaf he
 Now the Opposition has a common strategy for Sunday's meeting
 congress kii ore se anya vipakshi dalon ke mukhyamantriyon se sampark kiya gaya he
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi and Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar have been persuaded to oppose the decision to reorganize the Planning Commission on Sunday's meeting 
 darasal, yojana ayog congress ke liye bhaavnaatmak mudda he
 For the first time, a blueprint for an institution like the Planning Commission was laid out in the 1938 session of the Indian National Congress headed by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose in Haripura, Gujarat
 british raaj main bhi 1944 se 1946 tak yojana board ne kaam kiya
 After India became independent, the Planning Commission was established in March 1950 under the chairmanship of the first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru
 yahi vajah he ki chaahe upie sarkaar ke vakt bhi yojana ayog ko khatm karne kii baat kii gai he, magar ab jab aisa hone ja rahaa he, congress ise sangheey dhaanche par hamalaa bataa rahi he
 However, despite the opposition's opposition, it is believed that the Modi government will complete its plan to replace the Planning Commission with another institution
 par ye bhi tay he ki yojana ayog kaa sirf rup-rang or naam hi badalegaa
 This organization will continue to operate like any other by wearing a second costume
 iske kaam main bhi koi adhik parivartan nahin hoga
 But the coming together of all opposition parties to oppose it can create a new difficulty for the government
 khaastaur se tab jabaki rajya sabha main uskaa bahumat nahin he or samaajawaadee parivaar ikattha ho rahaa he
 The Trinamool Congress is very sharp and the Congress is not in a mood to give much concessions to the government, which was defeated in the Lok Sabha elections

 har baar kii tarah is part main bhichanki pandefilm kaa ahm hissaa hai
 He played the role of 'aakhri Pasta' in its first part 'housefull' which was quite famous
 tab se ve lagaataar is franchiji se jude hue hai
 Sajid Khan was the director of films in the Housefull franchise, but he was shown a way out of the film after his name in Meethu
 shaayad hi koi jaanata hoga ki chanki pandey, sajid kii har film main najar aate hai
 Chunky Pandey has worked with Sajid Khan in films like Housefull, Housefull 2 and Humshakals
 unki har film main chanki ahm kirdaar main hote hai
 There is an interesting reason behind this
 reports kii maane to chanki kii patni bhaavana pandey, sajid ko raakhi baandhti hai
 Once during Rakhi, Bhavana demanded Sajid to give Chunky a role in each of his films, and Sajid Khan also agreed
 tab se lekar aaj tak chanki, sajid kii har film main najar aa hi jate hai

 unhone yah aadesh police kii antim report ke khilaaf shiya dharmaguru kalbe javwaad kii ore se daakhil arji ko manjuur karte hue diya
 The case related to the murder of the police station Wazirganj was filed by Kalbe Jawwad

 Maybe the sun of Modi's fate shines in Delhi on Sunday

 apane-apane soobe main puure hanak or dhamak ke saath raaj karne vaale lekin apane rajya kii chauhaddi tak unki raajnneeti simati hui he
 Modi is also the Chief Minister, but the stature and scope of the post has increased so much that he defied the adage that Delhi is not far away
 sansadeey board main to modi kaa aana mahaj aupchaarikta maani ja rahi he
 After all, from the party president to other big leaders, for months, they have been reading ballads in praise of Modi
 kai ahm faislon main modi kii bhagidaari badhegipure 6 saal baad modi ke bahaane bijepi kii raajnneeti ne karavat badali he
 It was Rajnath, who made Modi a member of the parliamentary board in February 2006, but removed Modi in the month of March when he became the bjp's president in 2007

 But in 6 years, the BJP has turned full 360 degrees in front of Modi

 The Parliamentary Board takes all the important decisions of the party
 agar modi bijepi sansadeey board main aa jate hai to ab gujarat main hi nahin, balki duusare rajyon main bhi kai ahm faislon main modi kii bhagidaari bad jaaegi
 Anyway, Modi is busy adjusting some of his close friends to show his dominance in Delhi
 amit shah ban sakate hai mahasachivbahut sambhaavna he ki modi ke kareebi or gujarat ke purv grih rajyamantri amit shah ko mahasachiv banaaya jaae
 Similarly, another former BJP BJP president Om Mathur, close to Modi, is also likely to be made the general secretary
 vahi gujarat bijepi ke purv adhyaksh purushottam rupala ko upaadhyaksh banavaa sakate hai modi
 The gesture is clear that Modi, who put a hat-trick of victory in Gujarat, is no longer within the limits of satrap
 unhen bada dayera chahie or wo kendriya bhoomika se hi mil sakati he
 In India Today Conclave too, Modi had told in talks about how he got stuck in Delhi

 Nationalism! No radical nationalism! Today, is your real identity of Indianness the same extreme nationalism? Is being a liberal somewhere not the biggest war waged against new-age nationalism? Is your freedom of expression not the reason for your being a traitor? Is there any opposition to bigotry and imagining an all-inclusive society, not opposed to today's power-created Indianism? Have all those values and beliefs become redundant today after 72 years of independence, on whose support the long-standing battle of independence was fought? Is keeping the media under the shadow of undisclosed emergency the hallmark of new Indianness? And above all, the question is whether the thoughts, ideas and minds of freedom heroes - Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel - have become contextual in today's India? These questions collide with senior journalist Sagarika Ghosh's new book- Why i Am a Liberal: Individual Freedom yani vyaktigat swatantraaa se yaad aayaa ki bhartiya parampara main nijee swatantraaa ke mulya nihit hai or samvidhan bhi niztaa kaa adhikaar detaa he
 The author has spoken about those rights in the preface of his book
 yah kitaab, jaisaa ki iske naam se hi vidit he, is sawaal par jitna jor detaa he ki koi vyakti kyon udaarpanthi ho saktaa he, utana hi jor is baat par bhi detaa he ki kisi udaarpanthi kii jarurat kyon he? jab saamaajik maanas ke kuen main hi bhang padi ho tab samaj boojh kii baat karnaa bemaani ho jaataa he, lekin is kitaab main us bhang ko hataane or hindustan ke asli rang-dhang ko parakhane kii koshish hui he
 The writer has emphasized that if Mahatma Gandhi is the biggest identity of India, then the biggest identity of that Gandhi is that he was the biggest liberal leader
 is udaartaa ko gandhi ne bhartiya parampara se nikaala or gulaami ke khilaaf raajnneetik ladaai kii parampara kaa hissaa bana diya
 Religious liberality became its first foundation upon which a grand building of economic and social generosity was built
 us gandhi kaa raajnneetik chintan yah jaanata tha ki rajya yani state kaa bada hona khatra he or bada rajya or bade khatre kaa vaahak banataa he
 The great sociologist MN Srinivas has written that Mahatma Gandhi was not only the father of India but also the father of the Indian liberal system
 to phir is gandhi ko kisi raajnneetik hindu ne maaraa yaa phir brahmavaadi hindu ne? hindutv or brahmanwad ke behad baarik ghalmail ko bagaiyr naam liye sagarika ghosh ne samajhane kaa prayaas kiya he
 After all, the Khilafat of liberality, the greatest Khilafat, performs the ritual of religion and if any religion is attacked, only those who run it cry
 gandhi ko duniya sabase bade hindu ke rup main jaanati he
 So, did Hinduism nurture the fanaticism of Gandhi's personality in itself, stunned by radicalism, and the same fear killed the Mahatma? Otherwise, why would India still stand in front of the world as a patriarchy nation? This is a big question mark on our religious consciousness and this question mark is underlined by Sagarika
 aaj jis tarah hindutv par aadhaarit rashtrawaad kii zanjeeron main yah desh jakadaaa hua he, usamen taarkikta kii baat bemaani ho jaati he
 The biggest feature of mania is that it destroys our reasoning power
 phir ham insaan ko insaan ke rup main nahin, bhagwaan yaa shaitan ke rup main dekhte hai
 When a person's own identity starts melting in the furnace of divinity or demonetisation, he needs an infinite nation hero to answer all his questions and solve all his problems
 phir raashtra main nihit saare tatv ek vyakti ke vyaktitv ke ird gird ghoomane lagate hai
 The nation gradually becomes secondary and the hero is always
 is khatre ko samvidhan kaa nirmaan karte samay hi doctor bhimrao ambedkar ne bhaanp liya tha
 That is why he wrote to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel that the country is bigger than the eldest man
 kalantar main isi baat ko prakhar netaa minu masane ne mardaana rashtrawaad ke udai or khatre ke rup main chihnit kiya tha
 The first condition of this masculine nationalism is to divide the society into two parts and become the majority's consent in it
 isaki duusari shart he samaaj main nafrat bhar dena
 That is the hatred in which we do not want to learn any lesson from history
 mahatma gandhi se lekar nehru or patel tak kisi bhi rashtriya andolan ke netaa ne angrejon se nafrat vaali raajnneeti nahin kii balki jarurat padane par unase bhi siikhaa
 But today every question from power considers the big question mark on the failures of old power as its answer
 isaki teesri shart yah he ki pratikon main rashtriyata ke tatv dhunde jaaen
 Sagarika writes that when Smriti Irani became the Minister of Human Resource Development in 2014, she ordered the hoisting of the tricolor in all the universities
 tirangaa har bhartiya ke gaurav kaa pratik he lekin jab us gaurav ko aap par jabaran thopa jane lage to samaaj raurav narak main badalane lagata he
 Then everyone has their own frenzy, in which the frenzy of the majority becomes nationalism
 mardaana rashtrawaad
 Sagarika Ghosh, a journalist writer, has divided her book into five chapters, among its references, interpretations, elements of history, circumstances of the present and future cries
 chunki aaj desh main sawaal uthaane vaale har shaks kii deshbhakti par sabase pehle sawaal uthta he
 Perhaps to tackle the same question, the first chapter is named The Liberal Patriot ie Liberal Patriot
 vah udaarpanthi deshbhakt har sawaal ko kriya kii pratikriya ke rup main nahin dekhtaa he
 That is why he appears lenient towards Ghalib Guru, son of Afzal Guru, convicted of terrorist attack on Parliament
 uski udaartaa un secular mulyon ke liye bhi chhalkati he jisko nav rashtrawaad ke praneta sicular kehete hai
 Our political social vision opens up in this chapter and many other basic questions from Kashmir also seek their answers
 doosraa adhyay he The Liberal Hindu yani udaarpanthi hindu
 Hindutva speaks of recognizing the soul
 aatma kii sabase badi vyakhya gita main hoti he or gita ko nae daur ke sandarbh main pesh kiya mahatma gandhi ne
 Today, in the way of mob lynching of Dalits and Muslims in the name of cow protection, Gandhi's reference is worth understanding
 gandhi gohatya ke pakshdhar nahin the lekin ve yah bhi kehete the ki unka dharm gaay ko maarane waalon ko maarane kii ijaajat nahin detaa
 Then why does one interpretation of the same Hindutva become so violent? In this chapter, Sagarika Ghosh takes a very nuanced view of the bjp's new development model and its mix of religion and hatred
 kitne virodhabhaason main jeeta he hamaara samaaj or jite hai hamaare dharm karm or samaaj ke thekedaar jo suvidhajanya chintan ke aadhaar par nehru ko khalanaayak banaate hai or bhagat singh ko nayak
 Whereas Bhagat Singh gave a befitting reply to the politics and business of religion from his historical article which was titled Why i am an Atheist
 udaarpanthi hindu kii baat jab sagarika uthaati hai to jis tursi se vah bijepi kii kattarpanthi raajnneeti par sawaal uthaati hai, usee shiddat se congress kii us tushtikaran kii raajnneeti par bhi jisamen shahbaano maamle main supreme court ke faisle ko sansad main shakti ke dam par badal diya gaya tha
 In the third chapter, Sagarika talks about liberal thinkers named The Liberal Thinker
 isamen vah vichaar kii baat karti hai, vichaardhaara kii nahin, kyonki aaj vichaardhaara par ek khaas tarah ke sochane vaale logon ne apana patent samaj rakhaa he
 From Sagarika Gandhi to Meenu Masani and American thinkers Thoro to Aurangzeb and Indira Gandhi to Nietzsche
 jaisaa ki minu masani ne kaha tha ki libral shabd liberty se niklaa he
 Liberty means freedom
 to saaf he ki aazaadee kii raksha ke liye jaruri he ki soch main udaartaa kaa put ho
 Canada party leader Monk is quoted in the book as saying that winning elections is less important than maintaining a liberal democratic system
 lekin jab chunaav jeetna hi aakhri satya ban jaae balki yah kahie ki satta main bane rahane kii koshish yaa yen ken prakaren satta hasil karnaa hi aakhri manzil ban jaae to us samaaj main udaarpanthi loktantric vyavastha ko dam todna hi padataa he
 In the game going on from Karnataka to Goa today, even the legislators have turned into commodities, who were once law makers
 to yah kyon nahin mana jaae ki loktantric mulyon ke paimaane badal gaye hai
 Now not in the rough world of reality, the government will take you in trouble
 baad main pole khulegi lekin is vakt to aap yahi gaate hue ghumenge ki aao hujur, tumko sitaron main le chaluun
 Through a research survey, Sagarika explains that the lust of going to the stars of hysteria and superstition is such that 53 per cent of people in India understand military rule better
 kaash, wo pados main pakistan ke 1947 ke baad kaa itihaas pard lete, tab samaj main aata ki sainik taanaashaahee kitni nirmam or ek jinda samaaj ke liye kitni khatarnaak hoti he! vastav main raajnneetik dalon main khatm hui loktantric prakriya bhi bataati he ki ham buniyadi sawaalon par ungali nahin uthaate
 Which party is in the country today that can say that it has kept the internal democracy alive? The party from which the Aam Aadmi Party had set its hopes high, has also become a slave of the tongue of an Arvind Kejriwal
 udaartaa kaa khaatmaa vah bhi karte hai jo udaarpanthi raajnneeti ke hami banate hai
 Otherwise, why would a professor at Jadhavpur University have to live in jail for making a cartoon of Mamata Banerjee? In this chapter, Sagarika exposes many bitter facts of the Gujarat model, knowing that you will be stunned
 chauthe adhyay main sagarika udaarpanthi matvirodhiyon kii baat karti hai jiskaa naam diya he The Liberal Dissenter
 In this, she raises all the questions in which a puncher, a Dabholkar is killed because he puts the reality of the ritual contractors in front of the people
 sagarika ne swami vivekanand ke sandarbhon kii vyakhya karke bhi bataaya he ki kaise unke mulyon ko samajhe bagaiyr unako hindutv kaa brands ambesader bana diya gaya he
 She writes that Swami Vivekananda was a nationalist for the right, but a reformist for the left
 matbhed kii is kadi ko vah maujuuda sarkaar tak le aati hai jahaan media ko sabase bada netaa baazaaroo kahata he to ek mantri prestitute
 The rhyme may look good, but it is not only a question of the dignity of the media, but the dignity of women is also tied to the thinking of the minister
 jis nehru ko gandhi ne apana uttaradhikari banaaya, us nehru se bhi gandhi ke kai masalon par gambhir matbhed the lekin matbhed kabhi manabhed kii maryaada kaa atikaraman nahin kar paaya
 If the identity of India's antithesis is erased, then we will be seen moving towards erosion as a democratic state
 sagarika ne paanchaven adhyay kaa naam rakhaa he The Liberal Woman yani udaar mahila
 If seen, women are the last colony of men
 kisi bhi dharmik samaaj main kattarta kii chot sabase zyada kisi par padati he to ve mahilaayein hi hoti hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi gives a slogan of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, but how our generosity about saving and teaching daughters merges into a void is a big question mark on the forehead of our society
 ab bareli ke bijepi vaale vidhayak rajesh mishra ko hi le lijie
 His daughter got married with a Dalit boy
 us ladki ne ek anjaan jagah se ek video post daalaa ki usko apane vidhayak pita se jaan kaa khatra he
 In the social environment in which we live, the politics of vote divides society into Hindu versus Muslim
 usamen musalamaanon ke barksh sabhi hindu ek bataae jate hai lekin jaise hi kisi brahman kii ladki kisi dalit ke ladke se pyaar kar baithe yaa shaadi kar le to hindutv kii sari maryaadaayen or ekta chhin bhinn ho jaati he
 Here we have to pay attention to how we have intertwined with the question of respect for the girl
 sagarika ne kitaab main film padmavat par mache bavaal se lekar mahabharat ke daur tak kii ghatnaon kaa zikr kiya he
 The great political philosopher Voltaire said that we may not agree with your views, yet we will protect your freedom of speech
 valtere kaa yah kathan hi ek udaarpanthi samaaj kii disha main maanavtaa kaa badha kadam ho saktaa he
 But the tragedy of India was that very few people who came to power here allowed liberal thinking to develop
 sagarika kii yah kitaab bharat ko aadhunik sandarbh main samajhane ke liye ek nai drushti di he
 But this book could have been made more tight
 udaahranon or sandarbhon kaa boj kuch zyada ho gaya he
 From this point of view this book is more important for research scholars than the general reader
 kitaab angreji main he lekin aam aadmi tak pahunchane ke liye iskaa hindi main anuvaadit hokar aana jaruri he

 Sidhu said that only those people who have pasted posters have to say this to answer

 The law and order, police and land are still not with the Delhi government
 sarkaar ne is baat par jor diya he ki court ne sarkaar par tippanee kii he ki araajaktaa nahin honi chahie
 The government's statement is that the Center never questioned the rights of the Delhi government, but in these three cases the authority is with the President whose agent is LG

 haalanki, services ke maamle mencendre courtke faisle kaa abhi bhi adhyayan karne ko kah rahaa he
 At the same time ACB cannot go to Delhi government because it is part of the police, because it involves criminal investigation

 The first Test match of the series between India and New Zealand, starting on Thursday, will be played in Hyderabad, and this will be the first time in the last 16 years when both Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman will be absent from Team India
 
 
 vivies 'veri veri special' lakshmana ke sanyas le lene ke baad dotest maichon kii shrunkhlaa ke hyderabad main hone vaale is pehle match ke prati darshakon kaa utsaah bhi behad kam rah gaya he
 
 
 According to the officials of Hyderabad Cricket Association, the sale of tickets has also been affected due to the absence of local hero Laxman in the team
 
 
 baharhaal, series ke pehle test match main donon hi tiimon kii koshish nai shuruyaat karne kii he
 
 
 In one-day International cricket, even though Team India is in form, in the Test format, this team, led by Mahendra Singh Dhoni, will have to make a lot of effort to get back the lost credibility
 
 
 is baar muqabla bhale hi newzealand se he, lekin team india ko england or australia ke haathon mili haar ko bhulaakar aage badhanaa hoga or jeet se shuruyaat kerani hogi, taaki manobal ooncha bana rahe
 
 
 At the same time, the visiting New Zealand team will also want to forget the crushing defeat at the hands of the West Indies and make a fresh start in India
 
 
 vaise agar pichley 10 test maichon kii baat karen to donon tiimon ko apni form main kaaphi sudhaar karnaa hoga
 
 
 India have won just two of their last 10 Tests, while Team India, which managed to draw one, lost seven matches, while New Zealand lost four of their last 10 matches, three
 Won, and only three draws
 
 
 aane vaale dinon main bharat ko apane agle 10 test match apni hi zamin par khilne hai or itihaas gavaah he ki bharat ko bharat main haraana aasaan kaam nahin
 
 
 Looking at the previous record of New Zealand in India, the Kiwi team has not been able to win any Test in India for the last 24 years
 
 
 donon tiimon ke maujuuda form par nazar daalen to kiwi team main anbhavi ballebaazon kii kami he
 
 
 Barring Brandon mccullum, Ross Taylor and Martin Guptill, no batsman has the ability to stick on Indian pitches
 
 
 udhar, bharat ke spinning trek par danniel vettori kii gairmaujuudagi main newzealand kii gendbaazi bhi kamazor sabit ho sakati he
 
 
 The comments vaise ross tailor kii team ke mukaable team india zyada majboot nazar aa rahi he
 
 
 The absence of Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman has made the team's middle order somewhat weak, but the fans are confident that Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team will overcome this challenge
 
 
 gendbaazi main philhal team india ke liye zyada chintajanak kuch nahin he, kyonki zahir khan or ishanth sharma puri tarah feet hokar vaapasi kar rahe hai
 
 
 In such a situation, amazing can be expected from these two on the Hyderabad wicket
 
 
 vaise hyderabad ke rajeev gandhi stadium ke pich curator ke mutabik pehle test match main pich se tej or spin, donon tarah ke gendbaazon ko madad milegi or match kaa nateeja zarur nikalegaa
 
 
 However, in the first Test match of the series, both teams try to make a new start
 
 
 van−de international cricket main bhale hi team india form main ho, lekin test format main mahendra singh dhoni kii aguai vaali is team ko khoi hui saakh waapas paane ke liye edi-chotii kaa jor lagaana hoga
 
 
 This time, even though it is against New Zealand, Team India will have to forget the defeats at the hands of England and Australia and start with the win, so that morale remains high
 
 
 vahiin, mehmaan newzealand kii team bhi west indies ke haathon mili karaari haar ko bhulaakar bharat main nai shuruyaat karnaa chaahegi
 
 
 However, if we talk about the last 10 Test matches, both the teams will have to improve their form a lot
 
 
 bharat ne apane pichley 10 test maichon main se sirf do jite hai, jabaki ek ko drow karne main kaamyaab rahi team india ko saat maichon main shikast kaa saamana karnaa padaa, jabaki newzealand ne apane pichley 10 muqablon main se chaar match haare hai, teen main jeet hasil kii he, or teen hi drow rahe hai
 
 
 In the coming days, India has to play its next 10 Test matches on its own land and history is witness that defeating India in India is not an easy task
 
 
 bharat main newzealand ke pichley record ko dekhen to pichley 24 saalon se kiwi team bharat main koi test nahin jeet saki he
 
 
 Looking at the current form of both teams, the Kiwi team lacks experienced batsmen
 
 
 brandan makkulam, ross tailor or martin guptil ko chhodkar koi bhi ballebaaz bhartiya pichon par tikne kaa madda nahin rakhata
 
 
 On the other hand, New Zealand's bowling may also prove to be weak in the absence of Daniel Vettori on India's spinning track
 
 
 tippaniyan By the way, Team India looks stronger than Ross Taylor's team
 
 
 rahul dravid or vivies lakshmana ke na hone se team kaa middle order kuch kamazor zarur hua he, lekin phans ko bharosa he ki mahendra singh dhoni kii team is chunauti se zarur paar paa legi
 
 
 There is nothing more worrying for Team India at the moment in bowling, as Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma are returning to fit fully
 
 
 aise main hyderabad kii wicket par in donon se kamaal kii ummid kii ja sakati he
 
 
 According to the pitch curator of the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium in Hyderabad, the pitch will help both fast and spin bowlers in the first Test match and the result of the match will definitely come out
 
 
 vaise agar pichley 10 test maichon kii baat karen to donon tiimon ko apni form main kaaphi sudhaar karnaa hoga

 After the enactment of the Bihar Alcohol Prohibition and Excise Act 2016, there was a complete ban on alcohol in Bihar, but since the enactment of this law, it seems that thinking about alcohol can also be expensive
 
 ji haa, agar aapaki soshal media main zyada disachaspi he, aap apni abhivyakti kii aazaadee ke tahat apni raay bhi soshal media par rakhten hai to jaraa saavdhaan ho jaaie
 Just as posting offensive posts on social media has been classified as a crime, similarly on social media opposing prohibition or promoting alcohol or promoting alcohol, you can eat jail air

 In addition to himself, the District Magistrate of many districts of Bihar has formed a separate team to monitor social media
 us team kii keval yahi jimmevary he ki vososhal mediaper kahin sharabbandi ko lekar koi aapattijanak post to nahin kiya gaya he
 On receiving such complaint, instructions have been given by the District Magistrate to the officer concerned to take immediate action

 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting that the process should be completed at the earliest, amidst the furore over CCTV tender in the capital Delhi
 saath hi is sambandh main unhone pradhanmantri se milane kaa vakt bhi maanga he
 Kejriwal, in a 2-page letter to the Prime Minister, has lashed out at Delhi's LG Anil Baijal and accused him of obstructing several important schemes including the process of installing CCTV
 kejariwal ne is patr main 6 jagah aapke alji shabd kaa ullekh kiya
 Kejriwal's letter Kejriwal said that starting the letter with the security system of women, CCTV came to the camera
 pradhanmantri ko bheja patr-aapane kuch din pehle mahilaon ke saath galat kaam karne waalon ke khilaaf sakht sajaa kaa praavdhaan kiya, iske liye aapako badhai
 But until the system on the land is not fixed, then these things will remain on paper
 mahilaon kii suraksha ke liye dilli sarkaar ne puri dilli main sisitivi camere lagane kaa kaam shuru kiya
 People from all over Delhi welcomed it very much
 khaskar mahilaayein bahut khush ho gayi ki ab unke ilaake main bhi sisitivi camere lagenge or unki or unke parivaar kii mahilayen surakshit mahasoos karengi
 LG imposed the impulse
 He further wrote in his letter - CCTV cameras were about to start
 sari prakriya puri kar lee gai thi
 The budget was passed, all objections were cleared, cabinet approval was received, tenders were awarded and the contract was awarded to BEL, a central government company
 puri dilli main camere lagane shuru hone vaale the
 Suddenly your LG sir came in the middle and stopped the snag
 unhone hamen bina bataae sisitivi camaron par ek samiti bana di
 The question arises that when all the work was done, the cameras were about to be installed, the public was eagerly waiting for it, so why formed this committee now? What will this committee do? And if the committee were to be formed, we would have made it by talking to us
 hamaari peeth peeche, hamen bina bataae samiti banaai
 This clearly shows that your LG intention is bad
 is samiti kaa ek hi makasad he- kisi bhi keemat par adchane laga kar sisitivi camere lagane se roko
 Mohalla clinic file also stopped: Your LG Sahab had also stopped the file of Mohalla clinic last year
 dedh saal tak filon par ulti-sidhi aapatti karte rahe
 Mohalla clinics were not allowed in Delhi for one and a half years
 dilli ke logon main isko lekar bahut zyada gussa he
 Similarly, just a few days ago your LG Sahab had dismissed Atishi working on a salary of just one rupee in the field of education in Delhi government
 shiksha ke kshetra main dilli main krantikari kaam ho rahaa he
 The removal of Atishi has affected this work
 aapke alji sahab dilli main ho rahe har achche kaam main rode atka rahe hai
 People are very angry
 logon main charchaa he kii alji sahab ye sab centre ke ishaare par kar rahe hai
 People believe that the central government does not want the Delhi government to do a good job
 meraa aapse anurodh he kii aap kripaya alji sahab ko turant aadesh den ki ve dilli main sisitivi camere lagane den
 It is related to the safety of women

 My portfolio has played an important role in the victory of Congress

 Let me tell you that even after the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, when the period of upheaval and brainstorming was going on within the Congress, Sidhu gave his response in a shaire style
 siddhu ne twit kar kaha tha, 'girte hai shahasavaar hi maidan-e-jang main, wo tifl kya gire, jo ghutanon ke bal chale'
 Let us tell you that the confrontation between Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh and Navjot Singh Sidhu is also going on

 produser, diarector anand el raay, kabhi 'ranjhna' or 'tanu vaids manu riterns' jaisi filmein diarect karte hai to kabhi dil ko chhu jane vaali 'nil batte sannata' jaisi filmon ko produs karte hai
 In a special conversation with Anand L
 Rai, he talked about many more issues besides mentioning about his upcoming films, here are some excerpts of this conversation: 'nil Batte Sannata' is getting much appreciation? i am very happy, perhaps i was not so happy even when 'ranjhana' and 'tanu Weds Manu' were released
 is film se beintehaa pyaar mil rahaa he
 You are associated with the film as a producer, what attracted you to join it? As soon as i heard the story of the film i felt that it was very important to do it, it was very important to reach the film
 kya aise vishyon par or bhi filmein aap banaate rahenge?meri puri koshish rahegi kii main aisi filmein janata tak pahunchaaun ,jahaan tak bhi ho sakegaa main jarur karata rahoonga
 Such films will continue to come from my company
 iske baad or koun-koun si filmein aap laa rahe hai?ek bahut khubasurat si film 'nimmo' bani hui he, jisaki kahani kaaphi acchhee he
 Then there is a light commercial commercial 'happy Bhag Jayegi' starring Abhay Deol, Diana Penty, Jimmy Shergill and Ali Fazal
 phir ek film 'man marjiyaan' aegi, uski shooting july agast main shuru hogi, jisamen ayushmaan khurana or bhoomi pednekar hai
 There were reports that the director of 'mana Marjiyaan' has been changed? My production house which has a single objective is to collaborate with the directors to create a product that the studio does not think much about before releasing
 'man marjia' mere dost samir sharma diarect kar rahe the, kanika dhillan ne kahani likhi
 But after shooting for a few days, me and Sameer felt that this film is not breathing as we thought, then we decided together that we are not together on this story, in the coming days Will definitely be associated with some other film
 or ab ye film 'ashvini ayyar tiwari' diarect karengi
 What is the report of 'dwarf' with Shah Rukh Khan? i am still working on that film
 mehnat kar rahaa hum or mujhe lagata he ki is saal ke andar main kuch taiyaari karke khan saab (shahrukh khan) ke saath kuch dilachasp sa kaam kar paaunga
 But taking my time to calculate, it is a 'dwarf' story to say, but it is such a long story, i am very excited
 khan saab se milakar mujhe ek hi baat bahut acchhee lagati he ki itnaa bada superstar jab aapse baat karata he to lagata he ki ek dilli kaa ladkaa hi aapse mil rahaa he
 Whenever we come, better come
 aapaki filmon main ek se badhkar ek kirdaar nibhaa chukikangana ranotin dinon kaaphi legal notice kaa saamana kar rahi hai?kangana bahut hi strang personality hai, kaaphi swatantra rahati hai

 wo faisle bade achche andaaj main leti hai
 i have known him since 2008, i feel that those who are having their problems right now, after 6 months will be laughing at these things themselves and talking about their mistakes

 Scindia's explanation on Twitter's bio change- a month ago, Bio was changed
 There has been a lot of speculation since Congress leader and former MP Jyotiraditya Scindia changed the bio on Twitter
 sindhiya ne apane twitor handle se congress kaa zikr hataakar khud ke liye samajasevi or cricket premi likhaa he, jiske baad se hi iske kai myne nikaale ja rahe hai
 However, Jyotiraditya Scindia dismissed all speculation about changing the bio on Twitter
 sindhiya ne kaha ki mujhe nahin pataa ki baio badalane ko itnaa kyon tool diya ja rahaa he
 He said that i had changed my bio on Twitter handle about a month ago, because i was constantly getting feedback that this bio is too long
 sindhiya ne kaha ki maine baio ek maheene pehle hi badal diya tha, lekin ye ab kaise crop kiya gaya ye mujhe nahin pataa
 Speculations on removal of political intro make it clear that since Scindia's removal of political intro from his Twitter handle, there has been speculation that he is not doing everything right with Congress
 vahiin, haal hi main is aise maukon par sindhiya ne bayaan diya jisase ye lag rahaa tha ki unke or congress party ke bich sabakuch thik nahin he
 Scindia had raised his own party's Kamal Nath government in the dock in terms of debt waiver, survey for flood relief and power cuts, which gave the BJP many opportunities to attack the Kamal Nath government

 angrejon ne foot daalo or shashan karo kii niti apanaai thi
 He said that independence was to be granted in June 1948, but Viceroy Mountbatten pulled it up only till August 1987, due to which an atmosphere of fear was created
 is dauraan unhone yah bhi kaha ki jab saal 1979 main mountbeton kii maut hui, to bharat sarkaar ne saat din kaa shok ghoshit kiya tha or raashtra dhvaj aadha jhukaaya tha

 There will not be an Islamic country
 yahaan hindu-musalmaan sab milakar baraabar rahenge
 Kulkarni said, "advani had also said that this is a model of secularism, then at that time Advani only told the truth
 jinna ne baad main ek intervyuu main kaha tha ki bharat or pakistan ke sambandh america or canada jaise hone chahie
 Jinnah told his first High Commissioner Sriprakasha that go and tell Jawaharlal Nehru that i want to come back to Mumbai
 maine vahaan jo ghar banwaaya he, vahaan rahanaa he
 '' gujarat ke narmada pahunche congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne somvaar ko adivasee adhikaar jansabha ko sambodhit kiya
 Rahul congratulated everyone on the foundation day of Gujarat and Maharashtra
 vahiin bijepi or piem modi par jamkar prahaar karte hue kaha ki gujarat main agar congress satta main ai, to sabake man kii baat sunegi
 Describing Gujarat's women power as the pride of the nation, the Congress vice-president said, "gujarat has done a lot for India
 kuch vakt pehle main newjiland or australia gaya tha, donon hi desh doodh kaa niryaat karte hai
 The farmers there showed the new technology being used, but they said that they cannot compete with Anand and Amul as Amul has the female power of Gujarat
 'modiji kehete hai 70 saal main congress ne kya kiya?congress upaadhyaksh ne kaha, 'bahut saal pehle gujarat main ek polson deyari naam kii company hua karti thi
 Amul was not there at that time
 gujarat kii mahilaayein apni gaay kaa doodh polson company ko detii thim, jis kaa thik daam nahin miltaa tha
 When the women told their problems to Gandhiji, they asked Sardar Patel to go to Anand
 sardaar patel ke saath tribhuvan patel bhi the or phir mahilaon ne amul kii neenv rakhi
 'gujarat has changed,' said Rahul Gandhi, 'on the foundation day of Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi said that 70-80 years old Gujarat is not like that today
 gujarat main jo pragati hui he, ye ek vyakti ne nahin kii he
 This is done by crores of people of Gujarat, including Congress ideology
 kuch saal pehle kisaanon kii jameen chhini ja rahi thi, tab kisaanon ne bataaya ki unki jameen bade-bade udyogpati chin rahe hai
 Fahrulhul Gandhi said to the farmers of the Congress bill, 'congress introduced a new land acquisition bill, so that the farmers get good prices for their land
 is par bhi bijepi or modiji ne is bill kaa virodh kiya
 After winning the election, BJP tried to repeal the land acquisition bill and there was an attempt to bring an ordinance
 haalanki jab unhen pataa chalaa ki congress isse peeche nahin hategi, tab modiji ne kaha ki ve ye karnaa nahin chaahate the
 '10-15 people running in Gujarat, Rajarahul alleged that thousands of acres of land is distributed to industrialists, if the farmers raise their voice for their rights, the police beat their women in the houses
 aaj gujarat main 10-15 logon kaa raaj he, jaise polson company karti thi
 a few days ago people from the Patidar community came to me and said that our children do not get education in Gujarat
 kaam karke dikhaaegi congressjal, jangal or jameen adivaasiyon kii he, kisi udyogpati kii nahin he
 Congress enacted a law for the rights of tribals
 bijepiur aresas ke log adivaasiyon ko insaan nahin maanate hai
 The people of Gujarat had relied on Narendra Modi, but the truth is that the farmers of Gujarat, the small shopkeepers and the power used to be in Gujarat were only taken advantage of
 ham bade vaade nahin karte, marketing nahin karte, balki kaam karke dikhaate hai
 Everyone will listen to the Congress government; If the Congress government comes in Gujarat, then it will not be the government of one party, it will be the government of all
 wo kisi ko apane man kii baat nahin kahegi, balki sabaki baat sunegi or aapke man kii baat karegi
 In this election, the Congress will fight to the fullest and will defeat the BJP
