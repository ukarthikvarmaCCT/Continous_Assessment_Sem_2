 'meri umr 33 saal he or meri shaadi ko paanch saal ho gaye hai
 Everything was going well but an incident happened in the last few days which is bothering me a lot
 mere pati aksar apana phone lock karke rakhte hai lekin ek din wo phone analock chhodkar bathroom chale gaye
 "I curiously picked up his phone, which would have been better if i hadn't done it
" 
 
 maine unke photose vaale foulder ko kholaa to dang rah gai
 i found that my husband still talks to his ex-girlfriend and both share their photos with each other through whatsapp
 maine jab apane pati se is bare main sawaal kiya to unhone kaha ki wo donon sirf dost hai
 After that day, i start doubting my husband
 mujhe samaj nahin aa rahaa he kya karun
 'these 7 actions should not be forgotten immediately after eating, it was a question of a married woman, which has been answered by a psychologist from Mumbai
 agar aapke saath bhi aisa kuch hua he to aapako bhi is jawaab ko jarur padhanaa chahie
 
 
 The psychologist has replied, 'you can't stop someone from talking
 kuch khaas maukon par log apni eks garlfriend / boyfriend se normal baatcheet baat karte hai or isamen kuch galat nahin he
 But relationships are built on trust and trust
 'takat or tandoorusti kaa khajaana he ye fal, roj khaaen'apane pati kii eks garlfriend kii photose unke phone main milane par koi bhi pareshaan ho saktaa he
 But the good thing is that your husband agreed that both of them are still friends
 photose share karne kii vajah se aap pareshaan hai or isliye bhi kyonki unhone dosti kii baat aapse chhupaae rakhi
 The reason for this is that your husband may have felt that if he shares this thing with you then you probably do not like it
 or aapako chot naa pahunche isliye unhone ye baat aapse chhupaae rakhi
 "there are bound to be a variety of questions in your mind, but i think you should share your mind with your husband
" aap donon ko baithkar is masale par baat kerani chahie
 Husband's old relationships and feelings should be respected
 aapako apane pati ko galat nahin maananaa chahie naa unpar doshaaropan karnaa chahie
 Therefore, it is best to spend quality time with your husband and talk openly on it
 aap pati se aapako unki eks garlfriend ko milwane ke liye bhi kah sakate hai

 ’ Today is the second day of the Rail Roko movement of the Telangana Joint Action Committee to demand a separate Telangana state
 andolan ke pehle din kai netaaon or pradarshnakariyon ko police ne hiraasat main le liya tha
 Meanwhile, late last night, Congress MP Raziah was sent to judicial custody for 7 days and MP Poonam Prabhakar for 13 days
 police ne rail patari par dharna dene kii koshish kar rahe pradarshnakariyon par bhi sakhti se karrwai kii he, lekin kal hiraasat main liye gaye tiares ke netaa keti ramarao or unki beti kavita ko jamaanat mil gai he
 Meanwhile, the government has instructed all schools to open from Monday and if they do not do so, it is said to cancel their accreditation
 rajya parivahan kii basen 27 din baad phir se aaj sadak par dikh rahi hai, jisase yatriyon ko thodi raahat mili he
 The impact of the rail roko movement is fully visible on the South Central Railway
 130 se zyada trainon ko radd kar diya gaya he or kai trainon ke root badal die gaye hai or iskaa asar deshbhar main kaayle kii supplai par bhi pad rahaa he
 The Navy's version of the indigenous Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas has become the first aircraft in the country to successfully land an 'arrest landing'
 nausena main shaamil kiye jane kii disha main yah badi kamyaabi maani ja rahi he
 Capable of playing multiple roles, the fighter aircraft caught a wire with a hook attached to its fuselage to prevent shock while landing in the test facility
 kisi bhi vimaan ke liye vimanavahak pot par utarane kii khatir behad kam duuri main puri tarah ruk jane main sakasham hona kaaphi ahm hota he
 The test conducted on Friday at the test facility at the beach in Goa was conducted under the same conditions as an aircraft carrier, and where the aircraft had to hold the wire tied to the deck for landing
 isi kriya ko 'arest landing' kaha jaataa he
 So far only a few fighter aircraft have been able to undertake 'arrest landing', developed by the US, Russia, United Kingdom, France and recently China
 goa main samudratat par bani test facility main is pareekshan kaa baar-baar safal hona hi sabit karegaa ki LCA-N sabase ahm dizine feechar - kisi bhi vimanavahak pot ke deck par 'arested landing' ke jabaav ko yah vimaan jhel saktaa he - bilkul sahi kaam kar rahaa he
 Only when these seaside trials are successful will naval pilots heading the development program for the prototype of the LCA-N be able to take the next step - that is to actually land it on India's only operational aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya
 LCA-N vikaas team ke jude ahm sadasyon ne NDTV se baatcheet main bataaya ki unhone may-june ke dauraan goa test facility main 60 baar udaan bhari he
 To get the aircraft on the deck of INS Vikramaditya, LCA-N engineers and pilots have to be convinced that the aircraft 7
 5 meter prati second (1,500 foot prati minute) ke 'sinc rate' (neeche aane kii gati) se kshatigrast hue bina pot par pahunch saktaa he
 The engineers and pilots associated with the project are confident that they will achieve the target of landing certification
 is project se judi ek badi takneekee chintaa he, jo LCA-N ke vikaas kaarykram par asar daal sakati he
 The mechanical system that reduces the speed of the aircraft on landing on the INS Vikramaditya, ie the arster gear, is quite different in design from the arster gear, which is in the test facility in Goa
 LCA-N project team ke ahm sadsy ummid kar rahe hai ki is antar se project par asar nahin padegaa, lekin aashwast ve tabhi ho sakenge, jab vastav main pot par landing kar lee jaaegi
 After Bangladesh's victory over the Netherlands, it has become necessary to assess the position of the teams in Group 'B'
 is akalan main netherlands or ireland ko shaamil nahin kiya ja rahaa he kyonki unka quarter final main pahunchnaa ek tarah se naammumkin he
 The remaining five teams competing for the quarter-finals are South Africa, West Indies, India, England and Bangladesh
 ek group se kinhi chaar tiimon ko hi antim-8 main pahunchnaa he lihaaja group 'bi' se is hode main shaamil kisi ek team ko baahar kaa rasta naapnaa hi hoga
 So while Bangladesh have beaten England, Ireland and the Netherlands to register six points in their account, the England team has slipped to fifth place
 pehle sthaan par bharat he, jiske saat ank hai
 In second place is West Indies (6 points) and in third place is South Africa (6 points)
 bangladesh apratyaashit dhang se chauthe sthaan par pahunch gaya he
 After this match Bangladesh has a total of five matches to be played in Group 'B'
 isamen ek muqabla 18 march ko ireland or netherlands ke bich bhi hona he
 This match is not included in the assessment as it will not affect the position of the teams
 15 march ko dakshin africa ko ireland se bhidana he, jisamen dakshin africa kii jeet pakki maani ja sakati he
 After this she will have eight points and will reach the first place in the table
 17 march ko england or westeindies ke bich hone vaala muqabla donon tiimon ke saath-saath bharat ke liye bhi kaaphi ahm hoga
 England's defeat in this match will make India's job easier, while on the other hand, after winning this match, West Indies will reach the final-8
 england ke liye yah karo yaa maro kii sthiti vaala match hoga
 England's defeat would mean his return home
 lekin is match main agar england westeindies ko haraa detaa he to uske saat ank ho jaaenge
 In this way, he will reach India's level and if he wins by a big margin then his net run rate will also be better than India
 aisi sthiti main bharat ke liye sankat khadaa ho jayega
 After this, Bangladesh will face South Africa on March 19 in Dhaka
 ise jeetne kii sthiti main dakshin africa talika main apni sthiti ko or majboot karegi lekin agar vah ulatpher kaa shikaar ho gaya to bangladesh aath ankon ke saath antim-8 main pahunch jayega
 In this case, the West Indies will have to be defeated under any circumstances to make a clear place in the final-8 in front of India
 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhauni ne nagpur mukaable se pehle kaha tha ki unki team quarter final main pahunch chuki he lekin tab dhauni ko is baat kaa andaja nahin rahaa hoga ki unki team dakshin africa se haar jaaegi or udhar bangladesh apane ghar main england ko patkhni de degaa
 Not being able to save the Indian bowlers' target of 338 against England is costing the team dearly
 us match se bharat ko agar do ank mil gaye hote to use aaj is sthiti se nahin guzarana padataa or use quorterfinal main jagah banane ke liye duusare tiimon ke nateezon par nirbhar nahin rahanaa padataa

 There are 200 complaints in which there have been incidents of tampering inside the house
 dilli main 2012 main hue nirbhaya gangrape cond kii jaghanyata ne puure desh ko hilaa kar rakh diya tha
 In view of this, the then Manmohan Singh government of the Center announced a special fund dedicated to the protection of women, named the 'nirbhaya Fund'
 aaj jab is fund ko sansad kii sanstuti milane ke paanch saal puure ho chuke hai tab hamaara yah jaananaa jaruri he ki is fund ke jariye sarkaar peediton ko kitna laabh de pai he
 What is the Nirbhaya Fund? After the Nirbhaya incident that shook the collective consciousness of the country, a fund was needed to ensure the safety of women
 jis par sangyaan lete hue tatkaaleen upie sarkaar ne 2013 ke bajet main nirbhaya fund kii ghoshnaa kii
 Finance Minister p Chidambaram also initially allocated 1000 crores
 2014-15 or 2016-17 main ek-ek hajaar karod or aavantit kiye gaye
 This money was allotted, but the government could not spend it
 grih mantralay dwaara is fund ke liye aavantit dhan kaa maatr ek fisadi kharch hone kii vajah se saal 2015 main sarkaar ne grih mantralay kii jagah mahila evam bal vikaas mantralay ko nirbhaya fund ke liye nodel agency bana diya
 Under the Nirbhaya Fund, 660 integrated one-stop centers were to be set up across the country to address rape related complaints and compensation
 jisase peeditaaon ko kanoonee or aarthik madad bhi mili or unki pahchaan bhi chhipi rahe
 Also, CCTV cameras were to be installed in public places and transport
 jisase apradhi kii pahchaan kii ja sake
 How successful were the governments in giving compensation? Recently, the Supreme Court had expressed concern about the compensation given to victims of sexual violence under the Nirbhaya Fund
 sunwaayee ke dauraan rashtriya vidhik seva praadhikaran (nalsa) ne bataaya ki vibhinn rajyon main dushakarm kii shikaar maatr 5-10 fisadi peeditaaon ko hi nirbhaya fund ke tahat muaavja mil rahaa he
 Nalsa said that according to the data available in Andhra Pradesh, last year only one victim got compensation in 901 cases of sexual violence
 praadhikaran ne kaha ki aankadon se pataa chalata he ki rajasthan main 2017 main 3305 praathmiki darj huin or in yojanaon ke antargat 140 peeditaaon ko muaavja mila jabaki bihar main yon hinsa ke aaropon main 1199 praathmiki darj huin, lekin sirf 82 peeditaaon ko muaavja mil sakaa
 The Ministry of Women and Child Development, as the nodal authority, could not give a concrete reply to the Supreme Court, despite spending waiver for women upliftment and protection, spending only 600 crores and remaining 2,400 crores
 kyon vifal raheen sarkarein?darasal nirbhaya fund main peeditaaon ke muaavje ke liye nirdhaarit dhanrashi ke vitaran or prabandhan ko lekar ekikrut pranali kaa abhaav he
 The Supreme Court says that since this fund has three ministries, the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Women and Development
 ise lekar bhram kii sthiti he ki kise kya karnaa he
 Although the central government is providing funds in this fund, there is no clear provision regarding when and at what stage the compensation should be given to the state governments for sexual violence
 is kosh main sabhi rajyon main ek jaise praavdhaan nahin hai
 In a state like Goa, there is a provision of compensation of Rs 10 lakh whereas in many states there is a provision of 1 lakh
 jaani maani nyayavid indira jai singh kaa kahana he ki dilli kii hi tarah rajyon ke vidhik seva praadhikaran ko khud hi peeditaaon ko muaavja dene kaa adhikaar diya janaa chahie
 The state police should inform the FIR regarding sexual violence to the legal service authority of the place so that the process of giving compensation to the victims can be expedited

 But the remarks he made indicated that he was criticizing Modi without naming him

 '' sinha ne ravivaar ko inkaar kiya ki unhone modi kaa koi sandarbh diya tha
 He said, 'it was completely twisted
 jis kisi ne bhi yah reporting kii usne meri kahi baton ko puri tarah galat rup main samajha
 During the discussion, Sinha was asked about the present-day culture of 'I, me and myself' and the use of dialogue in such a case

 sinha ne iske baad 1975 ke apatkaal kaa hawala diya or kaha tha ki desh jaanata he ki asahmati kii aawaaj ko dabaane ke liye kiye gaye sabase majboot prayaas kaa kya hua tha
 Sinha said that we all know how the people of India reacted
 yahaan-vahaan galtiyaan ho sakati hai, ham maujuuda halaat ko lekar bahut chintit ho sakate hai kyonki hamaare mutabik aisi kuch chijen ho rahi hai
 He had said that the great Indian society will take this into consideration and will scatter those who do not believe in dialogue in India
 aapako bas agle chunaavon kaa intjaar karnaa hoga
 On Sunday, he said that the context of emergency has nothing to do with the current government
 lekin unhone jo tippanee kii thi usase sanket mil rahaa tha ki vah bina naam liye modi kii aalochana kar rahe hai
 During the 'difficult Dialogue' conference in Dona Paula on Saturday, Sinha said without naming Modi, "people of India will give him dust, you just have to wait for the next elections
" ’’ Sinha on Sunday denied that he had made any reference to Modi
 unhone kaha, ‘yah puri tarah se tod marod kar pesh kiya gaya
 Whoever made this reporting, he completely misunderstood my words

 Sinha then cited the Emergency of 1975 and said that the country knows what happened to the strongest effort made to suppress the voice of disagreement
 sinha ne kaha ki ham sabhi jaanate hai ki bharat kii janata ne kaise pratikriya vyakt kii thi
 Mistakes can happen here and there, we can be very worried about the current situation because according to us some such things are happening

 An effort by the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) research lab Defense Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL) to steal sensitive data through cyber attack has been thwarted
 is hamale ke prayaas kaa pataa lagaaya gaya or use block karne ke liye jaruri kadam uthaae gaye
 Quick Hill, the maker of security software, said this in its report

 The target of this cyber attack was the Defense Metallurgical Research Laboratory, drdo's research laboratory
 'report main kaha gaya he ki sinon muhim se chalaaya gaye abhiyaan kaa pataa paanch sitambar, 2014 ko laga
 Katkar said, "this attack was immediately detected and blocked by security solution in dmrl's computer and it could not cause any harm
" hamen yah samajhane main do saptaah lag gaye ki is hamale kaa makasad ghuspaith karnaa or hamaare raksha khufia se jude aankadon ko churaana tha
 However, he did not say what kind of loss could have been caused by the theft of data from the Hyderabad Situation Lab
 unhone kaha ki isamen samvedansheel aankadon ko hasil karne kii kshamta or use hamalaa karne vaale sarwar ko bheja ja saktaa tha
 Also, the attacker would have complete control over the machine from his control and command center
 quick hill kii jaankaree se yah pataa chalaa ki hamalaa vietnam main ek sarwar ke jariye kiya gaya tha, lekin sarwar kaa pataa or anya byoraa farji ho saktaa he
 Nothing has been said about the location of the attacker

 Slogans of 'kejriwal Murdabad' were raised against him at the Bhikiwind Gurdwara
 haalanki naare lagane waalon ko police or aap kaaryakartaaon ne baahar nikaal diya or kejariwal ne phir apana bhaashan shuru kiya
 Kejriwal was addressing people in the gurudwara

 Today is the third day of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's visit to Punjab

 jaan se maarane kii dhamkee vaale email kii jaanch jarishuukravaar ko kejariwal ko jaan se maarane vaale dhamkee bhare email kii jaanch dilli police kar rahi he
 This email was received by Kejriwal's office
 email karne vaale vyakti ne likhaa tha ki vah mukhyamantri par hamalaa karne ke liye hathiyaar juta rahaa he
 In this case, Delhi Police had also issued an alert to the Punjab Police
 sabha ke duusare din hangamadusri ore, shuukravaar ko punjab kii chunavi jameen par kejariwal kii sabha main ek baar phir hangaamaa hua
 Slogans of 'go back to Kejriwal' have been raised during the rally in Fazilka
 bataaya jaataa he ki dilli ke siem jab bhaashan rahe the, tabhi narebaaji shuru ho gai
 For this reason, Kejriwal also had to stop his speech
 jabaki mulaakaat karne vaale kisaanon ko bhi roka gaya
 Senior citizens, that is, older people pay higher interest on all bank deposits in the country
 masalan, saavadhi jamaa ho yaa aavruti jamaa kisi bhi bachat skim par senior citigen ko aam janata se kuch zyada byaaj miltaa he
 Banks do this because the lump sum received after retirement can attract the banks
 isse bainkon kaa kasa (karant and seaving account reshyo) badhata he or yah puunji bhi sthaayee swabhaav kii hoti he kyonki bujurg niyamit aay ke liye bainkon main epady karaane kaa vikalp chunate hai
 There is no risk of capital and regular income is also available
 desh main senior citigen kii aayu 60 varsh maani jaati he
 But there are some such terms and conditions when at the age of 57, a person starts getting senior citizen benefits
 aisa kab hota he?yadi koi vyakti 57 yaa 59 varsh kii aayu main hi apni naukari se ritair ho jaataa he to vah bank se senior citijan vaale benefit paane kaa hakdaar hota he
 For this, it is mandatory to bring a certificate of retirement from the company
 saath hi ritairement ke ek maah ke bheetar hi bank ko yah avgat karwaanaa hota he ki vah apane company yaa sanstha se ritair hua he
 If the retirement age in the company is 57 or 59 years, then before 60 years, that person will get senior citizen benefits
 kab nahin milegaa labhbanking export bataate hai ki yah laabh khatadharak ko viares kii sthiti main nahi miltaa he
 Because here the company has not retired him, rather he has decided to leave the job voluntarily
 aise main vah senior citijan vaale laabh paane kaa hakdaar nahi he
 For example, after the attractive BRS scheme issued by BSNL and MTNL, about 66 thousand people took retirement in the company
 lekin ye log bank se senior citijan vaale benefit paane ke hakdaar nahin honge, jabaki ek nijee company yaa sarkari sanstha jisamen 57 varsh hi ritairement kii aayu tay kii gai he vahaan ye benefit lagu honge
 So if you fulfill these terms and conditions and this special facility is available in your bank, then senior citizens can get benefits even before they turn 60

 ' sanjay lila bhansaali kii film 'padmavat' ke johar seen ko lekar film industry do khemon main bant gaya he
 In fact, recently, Swara Bhaskar wrote an open letter to Bhansali, accusing women of presenting women as objects through the film
 unhone kaha tha, mahilaayein sirf vajaina nahin hai
 For the past few days, Bollywood celebs have been reacting to this
 haal hi main india today ko die intervyuu main deepika se swara ke open letters par sawaal kiye gaye
 To this, Deepika said that Swara forgot to read the disclamer played at the beginning of the film
 sabase badi baat yah film puraane daur kii he
 The bravery and valor of women is shown in this film
 hamane johar kaa mahimamandan nahin kiya he
 Shahid gave the answer: Shahid Kapoor, playing the role of Rawal Ratan Singh in the film, responded to this open letter of Swara and said, when the whole film industry is supporting 'padmavat', in such a way, it is strange to show such opposition to Swara is
 ranvir singh ne diya javabswara ke letters kaa ranvir ne bilkul apane kool andaaj main kaha he ki mujhe baaki kuch to pataa nahin, lekin swara ne mujhe massej kar film main mere abhinay kii kaaphi tarif kii he

 i did not know that people who are not connected to films will also give their opinion and express their displeasure on me
 jab unase open letters main prayog kii gai bhashaa or shabd par sawaal kiya gaya to unhone jawaab diya, mujhe nahin pataa tha ki jo shabd maine letters main likhaa, wo angreji main 'V' se or hindi main 'ya' se shuru hota he
 So many people will feel bad about that
 open letters main bold shabdon kaa prayog karne vaali swara ko event main unheen shabdon ko bolne main kaaphi jhijak mahasoos hui
 He even went on to say, 'I cannot name that word here because many family channels are also present in the event here

 pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa kashmir ko lekar rukh vahi he, jo purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa tha
 But circumstances change with time
 modi, atal kii niti se alag bhi soch sakate hai
 While Atal Bihari Vajpayee's policies were praised by his opponents as well, Modi is always on the target of opposition parties
 ajtak ke saath exclusive intervyuu main kashmir ko lekar modi ne divangat purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke 'insaaniyat, kashmiriat or jamhuriyat' ke siddhant par hi chalane kaa vachan doharaaya, lekin yah spasht kar diya ki ghati ke mutthibhar raajnneetik pariwaron ko rajya ko bhaavnaatmak taur par blackmel nahin karne diya jayega
 No one will be allowed to play with the public sentiment of Kashmir
 desh ke chunaav main sena bhinarendra modi chunavi jansabhaon main kai baar doharaa chuke hai ki unke chunavi mudde main sena, seemaa or aatankwaad kaa mudda achoota nahin rahegaa
 At that time, Prime Minister Modi said openly in this interview, 'this time also my issue is to provide houses, gas and electricity to the poor
 main yahi baat bolta hum, lekin rashtriya suraksha bhi bada mudda he
 This is not the election of the municipal body, it is the election of the country
 desh ke chunaav main sena bhi he, seemaa bhi he or aatankwaad bhi mudda he

 We believe that the biggest loss of Kashmir has been done by streams like 370 and 35A

 modi ne kaha, 'main vahaan sanghathan ke liye kaam karata tha
 i have been visiting every district of the state

 However, the Prime Minister attributed the instability in the state to the dual language spoken by political families in the valley
 modi ne kaha, mutthibhar pariwaron ne jammu kashmir ko imotional blakemeling karne kaa rasta chunaa hua he
 Modi named the former alliance of BJP and PDP in Jammu and Kashmir as 'mahamilavat' of anti-radical ideologies
 modi ne kaha, 'mufti sahab ke vakt hamen ummid thi, lekin vah hamaari mahamilawat thi
 There was a meeting of oil and water
 or wo hamane kahkar kiya ki ham do alag-alag dhruv he, hamaara koi mail nahin baithegaa

 loktantr kaa takaza aayaa to hamane chhod bhi diya
 "insaniyat, Kashmiriyat and Jamhuriyatmodi have described the principle of late former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee as the best way to solve the complex problem of Kashmir
 modi ne kaha, sirf atal ji kaa formula hi kargar ho saktaa he- ‘insaaniyat, kashmiriat or jamhuriyat
 'but the Prime Minister also accused the high-profile families of the valley of emotional blackmailing the entire state
 pradhanmantri ne jammu or kashmir kii mukhya dhara kii partiyon ko chunauti ke lahaze main kaha ki ve srinagar or dilli main ek hi sur main bolne kii himmat dikhaaen
 Modi said, there are a handful of families who speak one language in Kashmir and come to Delhi and speak another
 ye doglaapan ujagar karnaa meraa kaam he or main kar rahaa hum
 They should have the courage that those who speak in Kashmir should also speak in Delhi
 ve do bhashaa bol rahe hai or expoj ho rahe hai
 pm's claim stalled inflation Prime Minister Modi said in the interview that the rise in inflation during his tenure is a symbol of a strong economy
 2014 main upie ke satta se baahar hone main mahangaai dar kaa ooncha hona bhi ek ahm kaaran tha
 Modi dismissed criticism of the government over demonetisation and the implementation of Goods and Service Tax (GST)
 arthvyavastha ke maujuuda prabandhan ko lekar modi ne kaha, ‘main puri tarah santusht hum
 'modi said,' If you look back at 2014, inflation used to be headlines
 aaj manhagaai kii charchaa hi nahin he
 The Prime Minister expressed surprise that the opposition is never asked how the current government kept inflation under a five-year term
 modi ne kaha, 'aap congress se kabhi nahin poochhate ki 2014 ke baad keemton main kaise giravat ai
 If asked, it would be very difficult for him to lie in public
 'badal gayi 'didi'haal main abhinayta akshay kumaar ko die intervyuu main modi ne pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee kii ore se unhen kurte gift main dene kaa zikr kiya tha
 Modi said that personal relationships and behavior are different and the battle for political ideology is different

 Modi said, 'advani ji wrote a very good blog
 ham kisi ko apana dushman nahin samajhate or yahi hamaari mul charitra he
 Shocking at the change in Mamata Banerjee, Modi recalled the days of 2009 when she talked about the illegal Bangladeshi expulsion from the country
 saath hi hinsa ke khilaaf aahvaan karti thim or pashchim bengal main raashtrapati shashan ke tahat chunaav kii maang karti thim
 Modi said, 'now she is Mamta didi
 vahaan chunaav main aae din hatyaein ho rahi hai
 i wonder what Mamata didi is
 ye chintaa kii baat he
 They would change so much i never imagined
 maine saarvajanik taur par kaha he ki mamata ji ko lekar meraa akalan galat niklaa
 In support of Sadhvi Pragya, the Prime Minister referred to the allegations leveled against him while being the Gujarat CM himself on the question asked about the BJP candidate from Bhopal, Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur
 modi ne kaha, 'mujh par itane aarope lage the or ek hawa bana di gai thi
 If the newspapers then pull out online media, you will get millions of pages against me
 or usee ke prabhaav main america ne mujhe vija dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 But when the truth came out, the same America came forward to invite me
 ye jhooth failaane kaa congress kaa modes aaprendi he
 The Prime Minister asked for Sadhvi Pragya that the court has also said that she can contest the election
 modi ne kaha, 'hindu aatank kaa naam dekar bharat kii jo hajaaron saal kii viraasat he use badnaam kiya gaya
 It has to be challenged from the front
 jaise ki unhone chaukeedaar ko chor kaha
 i defied myself by being a watchman
 inkaa munh tabhi band hoga
 'opponents' focus turned to EVM The Prime Minister said that after the three-phase polling, the focus of his opponents has shifted to EVM
 modi ne kaha, teen charan ke matdaan ke baad unki bandook kii nok jo he badal gai he
 Now their abuses are going to EVM

 This dialogue said in Nana Patekar's 'tiranga' is now resonating in the bcci's riot
 phixing main bisisiai mukhiya shrinivasana ke damaad kaa naam aane ke baad unke istife kii maang ho rahi he
 Behind him in the BCCI is the No
 2 vice-president and BJP leader Arun Jaitley or the IPL Commissioner and Congress leader Rajiv Shukla
 donon baar-baar shrinivasana ko istife ke liye samajhane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 State Government ministers are also getting statements
 magar ab tak shrinivasana sharam ke pani ko cement main milakar kancreet se jame hue the
 But from Wednesday the view of this cricket riot started changing
 guuruuvaar aate-aate ye tay ho gaya ki ab shrinivasana kii siyasat ko chunauti dilli nahin mumbai se milegi
 Maratha Chhatrap, NCP Supremo and former BCCI, ICC chief Sharad Pawar have taken a dig
 unke rukh ko dekhte hue kai rajyon kii cricket association ke sur bhi khulne lage hai
 Initially, Sharad Pawar adopted the strategy of Look and Under
 isliye unki party ke pravaktaa auki saansad devi prasad treepathi ne jab shrinivasana ke istife kii maang kii, to party ne fouran turra choda ki ye treepathi kii nijee raay he
 This should not be understood as the demand of the party
 uske baad 24 may ko daalamia ke dinar main jetali or shukla ne shrinivasana ko gherna chaha
 But Srinivasan made it clear that all three will resign
 iske baad kuch dinon ke liye bisisiai bahari taur par hi sahi sangathit dikhne kii koshish main rahaa
 But then patience was patient, his cup was to spill
 khel mantri jitendra singh ne bayaan diya, centre main mantri or empi kii cricket association ke mukhiya jyotiraditya sindhiya ne bhi bayaan diya
 Even Rajiv Shukla left the tongue of the right and left and came out on the open challenge
 magar chennai kaa kaarobaari bilkul bhi nahin kasmasaaya
 But as soon as Pawar arrives, his composition has started messing up
 pavaar play main badla gememahaul bhaanpate hue pavaar ne buudhvaar ko press main bayaan diya ki shrinivasana ko istipha dena chahie
 He also demanded from the Ministry of Home Affairs that every match of this IPL should be investigated
 unhone khuli chunauti vaale andaaj main kaha ki mere kaarykaal ke dauraan sabko saath lekar chalaa gaya tha
 The signal was clear
 shrinivasana ke mukhiya rahete desh main cricket ke hukmran paalon main bant chuke the
 Pawar then opened his wound and said that if i had been in his place, i would have left the post by now
 is bayaan ke baad hi kabhi pavaar ke dhur virdohi rahe or unase patkhni khaae bengal cricket association ke jagmohan daalamia bhi bol uthe, ki halaat badal rahe hai
 We have to rethink the support to Srinivasan
 guuruuvaar ko sharad pavaar bisisiai ke kai members se mili
 These meetings had the same agenda

 It is World Cup season, but in the current tournament, in lieu of cricket, Mahendra Singh Dhoni's wicketkeeping gloves are getting more headlines
 dhoni ke dastaanon par 'balidaan baij' ke nishaan ne world cap toornament ko nayaa mode de diya, jisase vivaad ne janm le liya he
 On one hand, Dhoni is not ready to change his gloves, while the ICC is not willing to reverse his stance
 aise main 'dhoni-isisi' prakaran maujuuda world cap kaa sabase bada mudda ban gaya he
 During India's first match against South Africa at Southampton on Wednesday, Dhoni was seen wicketkeeping with a sacrifice badge
 isisi ne dhoni ko apane dastaane se yah nishaan hataane ko kaha tha
 But Dhoni refused to remove this mark from his gloves
 bisisiai maahi ke samarthan main utari he
 BCCI COA Chief Vinod Rai said, 'we have already written a letter to the ICC seeking permission for MS Dhoni to wear a' sacrifice badge 'on his gloves
 'kya gloves par dhoni kar gaye hai chook? jaaniye kya kahata he ICC kaa niyamdichhchh bhi nahin badalegaa rusub ICC ke sutron ne kaha ki niyamon ke anusaar apil kii koi gunjaaish nahin he, lekin BCCI ke paas ICC ko patr likhane kaa adhikaar he
 The matter will be referred to the Technical Committee
 jisamen jeff alders, david richardsan, kumaar sangakaara, harsha bhogale or steve elvardi shaamil hai, lekin yah bahut sambhaavna nahin he ki ve apana rukh badal denge
 Former military officer in support of Dhoni, reminded that the ICC sources of the PAK team's actions say that the institution is not going to reconsider it in any way, because any other team can say something like that and the ICC has to allow it
 
 iske baad khel ke maidan main bhi dharmik yaa raajnneetik sandesh jayega, jis par ICC kabhi anumati nahin de sakati
 So it is almost certain that the ICC will not change its stand on this
 haalanki unhone yah bhi spasht kiya ki BCCI ne abhi tak is par koi aupchaarik apil nahin kii he
 The Indian Army said this - On the other hand, the Indian Army does not consider this mark on the gloves of Dhoni as a sacrifice badge
 indian army ke sutron ke mutabik yah special forcej kaa pratik chihn he jo maroun rang main hota he or ise hindi main likhaa jaataa he
 It is always worn on the chest
 dhoni ke dastaane par nishaan para special forcej kaa pratik chihn he
 See the storm created on the gloves, see how much respect Dhoni gives to the army, after the BCCI, the Sports Ministry also supported Dhoni
 khel mantri kiran rigiju ne kaha, 'khel nikaayon ke maamalon main sarkaar hastkshep nahin karti he, ve swytt hai
 But when the issue is related to the feelings of the nation, the interest of the nation has to be kept in mind
 main bisisiai se isisi main is maamle ko uthaane kaa anurodh karnaa chaahunga
 Why Dhoni sacrificed badge Former Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was given the rank of honorary lieutenant colonel in the Territorial Army in 2011 due to his achievements in cricket
 dhoni yah sammaan paane vaale kapil dev ke baad duusare bhartiya cricketer hai
 Dhoni was given an honorary commission as he is a youth icon and he can inspire the youth to join the armed forces
 dhoni ek prashikshit paratrupar hai
 He has taken a Para Basic course and wears paratrooper wings
 'maidan par pakistan team kii namaaj sahi, to phir dhoni ke gloves se kya dikkat?'mahendra singh dhoni ne pradeshik sena (tie) kii 106 parachute regiment main maanad leftinent karnal ke rup main apni rank ko sabit kar dikhaaya he
 Dhoni became a trained paratrooper in August 2015
 agra ke paratrupers training skool (pities) main bhartiya vaayu sena ke een-32 vimaan se paanchavin chalaang puri karne ke baad unhone pratishthit para wings pratik chihn (para Wings insignia) lagane kii arhata praapt kar lee thi
 That is, Dhoni got the ability to use this badge
 gauratlab he ki tab dhoni 1,250 feet kii oonchai se kud gaye the or ek minute se bhi kam samay main malpura dropping jone ke paas safaltaapurvak utre the
 In November 2011, Dhoni was awarded the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Territorial Army (TA)
 tab unhone kaha tha ki vah sena main adhikari bananaa chaahate the, lekin kismat ne unhen cricketer bana diya

 PM Modi was out of the country, Kejriwal was from Delhi, Rahul was out of reach and i understood the activities of the Congress
 dilli police ke jariye congress kendra par rahul gandhi kijasusi karwaneka aarope laga rahi he
 It happened that an ASI of the Delhi Police reached Rahul Gandhi's house and was collecting information related to him
 congress ko ye nagavar gujara or unhone iserajanatik jasusi kaa naam de diya
 Seeing this, the Congress leaders in this uproar, i remember my juniors from whom i took a small intro, and then started crying as a ragging
 rahul gandhi ke bare main puch-parakh karne par itani baukhalaahat kyon he ye tonhi pataa, par anumaan ye lagaaya ja rahaa he ki dilli police ke numaayindon neshayad ye puch liya ho ki rahul aajkal kaam-dhandha kya karte hai? congress kipratikriya ke rajnatik arth bhi talaashe ja rahe hai
 Those who know it, call it a juggle of Congress
 jasusi kaa dar dikhaa congress ye bataanaa chaharhi he ki rahul aisa kuch kar rahe hai jisaki jasusi bhi kii ja sakati he
 This is seen as an attempt to improve the image of Rahul Gandhi
 congress bhale ise rahul gandhi kii jasusi se jode par unhen khud nahi patiske pehle bhi ek baar rahul gandhi kii jasusi kaa prayaas ho chukaa he
 This was the time when Lok Sabha elections were to be held in the country
 rajnatik dalon ke war ruumamen sach main jang chhidi hoti, baithken-shadyantr, sulah-kalah joro par thim
 Social media would have a big bang all day long and on TV debates, spokespersons would be rubbing horns
 unheen dinon main ek pramukh rajnatik dal ne rahul gandhi kijasusi kaa prayaas kiya tha
 The purpose of this adventure was to find out what Rahul Gandhi is doing in preparation for the Lok Sabha elections
 Whom are you meeting? Professional observers were put in place to monitor their routine and behavior
 jasusi kaa prayaas tab asafal hua jab tisare hi din jasoos apane kaam se peeche hatagaye,jasuson ne jo bataaya use sach maane to aadha din unhen rahul ke jaaganeka intjaar karnaa padaa
 When everyone was strategizing in the war room of the Congress, Rahul would be seen gritting his teeth
 ek din rahul ne congress ke sarebade netaaon ko das janpath bula liya baad main dedh ghante tak sabun ke gubarefulane kaa kaushal dikhaate rahe
 Spying also revealed that the ticket distribution at the party was done by throwing a slip
 jasuson ne do din baad kaam ye kahkarchod diya ki ye sab kaam jaisaa nahin lagata ye to wo ghar par bacchon ko bhi karatedekhate hai
 (young satirist Ashish Mishra is an engineer by profession and lives in Indore) aaj tak ne mangalvaar ko ek sting 'oparation dilli police' dikhaaya
 It showed how Delhi's policemen are filling pockets with bribe money
 is sting kaa asar ye hua ki khabar chalane ke teen ghante ke andar hi 7 pulisavaalon ko suspend kar diya gaya or maamle kii jaanch sibiai ko saunp di gai
 The names of the seven policemen who have been suspended are as follows: Madanpal Bhati Inspector- Govindpuri Thanaanil Kumar Sub Inspector- Kalyanpuri Thanadigambar Singh Head Constable- Sangam Vihar Thanar S
 Naruka Inspector- Pul Prahladpur Thanasohanveer Head Constable- Bhalagaravar Thanalvar Meena Head Constable - Traffic Police
 padhein-exclusive: oparation dilli pulicevidio dekhne ke liye yahaan clic karenaaj tak par raat aath baje se 'oparation dilli police' shuru hua
 It began to expose bribery employees and officers of Delhi Police one by one
 dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar ne maamle main turant sangyaan liya or anti karpshan branch ko jaanch ke nirdesh de die or kah diya ki buudhvaar subah ghoosekhoron par exiaar darj karai jaaegi
 Arvind Kejriwal thanked Aaj Tak for this sting and said that no bribe will be spared
 aam aadmi party ke kai bade netaaon ne twit karke dilli police par nishaanaa saadhaa
 The operation was still being shown on TV when Delhi Police spokesperson Rajan Bhagat came on the phone line
 rajan bhagat ne bhi is sting ke liye aaj tak kaa shukriya kiya or kaha ki sabhi ghoosekhoron ko suspend karke inke khilaaf bhrashtachar kaa maamla darj kiya jayega
 Rajan Bhagat appealed to the people to bring such bribes to the fore and help in making the Delhi Police clean
 aaj tak par daagdar vardi waalon ko lekar khulaase jari the
 It was not past 11 pm that the Delhi Police spokesperson once again joined the phone line
 unhone bataaya ki maamla sibiai ko saunp diya gaya he
 Rajan Bhagat said that the Delhi Police suspended the bribes and registered a case on seeing the sting
 iske baad maamle kii 'free and fere' jaanch karaane ke liye grahamantralay se sibiai jaanch kii sifarish kii gai
 The home ministry immediately accepted the Delhi government's demand at night
 aisa pehle to kabhi na hua thaih pehla aisa maamla he, jisamen police ne itani teji dikhaai ho
 Till date, it has never happened that in less than three hours a case has been filed and a CBI inquiry has been demanded, nor has it ever happened that the Home Ministry has immediately agreed to conduct a CBI inquiry on the demand of the police
 dilli sarkaar ko overlap karne ke liye aisa kiya?chunki arvind kejariwal dilli kii bhrashtachar nirodhak ikai ko is maamle main jaanch ke liye pehle hi nirdesh de chuke the, to kaha ye bhi ja rahaa he ki isi jaanch se bachane ke liye aanan-fanan main maamla sibiai ke hawaale kar diya gaya
 Delhi Government Minister Manish Sisodia said that he fears that the Central Government has entrusted the case to the CBI only so that it is out of the purview of the Delhi Government
 manish ne sibiai par bhi nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki ve ummid karte hai ki sibiai apni us chhavi se ulat kaam karegi, jiske liye vah mashhoor he
 Why did this case show such speed? Manish Sisodia questioned that Delhi Police has shown such speed in this case, which is also right
 lekin baaki maamalon kaa kya? sisodiya ne poocha-uganda kii mahilaon ne sex racket kii shikaayat kii thi, is par karrwai kyon nahin hui?arunachal pradesh ke ek ladke nido kii hatya kar di gai, isamen bhi police par sawaal khadey ho rahe hai?isse pehle jab kanoon mantri somnath bharti ne sex racket ke khilaaf karrwai karne kii maang kii to police ne teji kyon nahin dikhaai?

 The government enacted stringent laws to make full prohibition in Bihar a success, but statistics show
 kade kanoon ke baavjood sharaab kii taskari main badhotaree dikh rahi he, kya logon main kanoon kaa dar khatm ho gaya he
 Full prohibition is in force from 5 April in Bihar
 bihar ke mukhiya nitish kumaar sharabbandi abhiyaan ko lekar kaaphi utsahit bhi hai
 The Bihar government has also banned liquor ban as a campaign
 sharabbandi ko safal banane ke liye vidhansabha se kathor kanoon bhi banaae gaye, lekin dharaatal par hakeekat kuch or hi najar aa rahi he
 Smuggling of liquor in Bihar is increasing rather than stopping
 ye ham nahin kah rahe balki ye hakeekat saamne ai he ki utpaada vibhaag dwaara jari aankadon se
 Despite stricter laws, the smuggling of liquor is ending the fear rather than creating fear in the people due to the stringent law made on liquidity
 yahi kaaran he ki pratidin bihar ke kisi na kisi jile mensharab kii badi khepapakadi ja rahi he
 People smuggling liquor are also being caught and they are also getting vine
 yahi nahin, sharaab pite kai rajaneta bhi pakade gaye or unako bhi bel mil gai
 In such a situation, the question arises, what kind of prohibition in Bihar again? The number of people who go to jail for liquor increases, according to the data released by Aditya Kumar Das, Commissioner of Excise Department in Patna, that every month after the prohibition is imposed in Bihar, the jail is sent every month
 Has increased rather than decreased
 utpaada vibhaag ke aankade ye bataate hai ki april 2016 main 1281, may 2016 main 2364, june 2016 main 2669, july 2016 main 3324 or agast 2016 main 4167 vyaktiyon ko giraftaar kar jail bheja gaya
 Now the question is that if the people were afraid of the law made about liquor, then not many people would be arrested
 agar in giraftaar kiye gaye logon main se jamaanat milane ke aankadon par gaiyr karen to april 2016 main 583, may 2016 main 1112, june 2016 main 1296, july 2016 main 2331 or agast 2016 main 668 ko jamaanat bhi mil gai
 Continued liquor seizures in place of liquor The liquor seizures were also made in Bihar through the joint efforts of the Excise Department and Bihar Police on a large scale
 1 april 2016 se 31 agast 2016 tak puure bihar main kul 85171 chhapamari kii gai, jisamen 13839 logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya or usamen se 13805 logon ko bihar ke vibhinn jelon main bheja gaya
 During this period a total of 11679 liters of foreign liquor, 92291
 47 litre deshi sharaab, 26524
 26 liter spirit, 9763
 99 litre bear ke alaava deshishrab banane ke samanabramad kiye gaye
 It is to be noted that despite the prohibition of liquor ban in Bihar, 19 people died due to drinking poisonous liquor in Gopalganj district
 visra report se ab is baat kii pushti bhi ho gayi ki ye 19 mautein jahrili sharaab pine se hi hui he
 The government was also very bad about the Gopalganj incident

 Wrapped in strict sections of the law, the police has prepared such a book that it does not seem that Holi or night Diwali will ever happen on the day Baba comes
 yon shoshan kii tohamat se shuru hua baba kii barbaadi kaa safar sex racket chalaane jaise ghinaune iljaam par khatm hoga, ye shaayad hi kisi ne sochaa tha
 Now if all the charges against Baba are proved true in the court, then understand that the rest of Baba's life will be spent in jail
 asaram par jodhpur police ne jo kanoonee dharaaen lagaai hai ve baba ko baaki puri jindagi jail main rakhane ke liye kaaphi hai
 They are currents
 dhara 120, dhara 342, dhara, 354, dhara 375, dhara 506, dhara, 509, posko act kii dhara-5

 The charge sheet against Asaram would have been presented earlier, but it was deferred for some reasons
 ab chah november ko jodhpur court main baba ke khilaaf chargeshit pesh hogi
 Asaram had opened an iniquity shop under the guise of religion
 bhakton ko wo ram lila, krishna lila dikhaate the, lekin chargeshit ke hisaab se parade ke peeche wo paap lila main mashgool the
 These misdeeds of Asaram earned the infamous Sanatan Dharma
 aise main har tabake ko lagata he ki aise paakhandiyon ke liye sakht sajaa jaruri he
 Asaram was accused of sexual exploitation of a minor girl for the first time, but as the investigation progressed, Asaram's reality also came to the fore
 chah november ko daakhil hone ja rahi chargeshit main asaram par yon shoshan, chhedchhad, sex racket chalaane or yahaan tak ki ladakiyon kii kharid-farokht ke bhi ilzaam hai
 If the Jodhpur police has prepared a list of charges against Asaram, arrested for sexual exploitation, you can think of Asaram's fate if he is found right on the basis of justice
 kyonki asaram ke khilaaf sirf ek naaballig ladki ke yon shoshan kaa ilzaam hi nahin he, balki police ne isi silsile main asaram par jismfaroshi or ladakiyon kii kharid-farokht tak karne ke sangeen ilzaam lagaae hai
 And in this case, registered under the sections of rape to POSCO Act, one or more crimes can be punishable by life imprisonment
 police ne apisi kii dhara 376 ke tahat asaram ke khilaaf jo mukadmaa darj kiya tha, uske mutabik agar asaram yon shoshan ke maamle main gunahagaar paae gaye, to unhen saat saal se lekar aaajeevan karawas tak kii sajaa ho sakati he
 But according to the police, Asharram's crimes are far longer
 police ne asaram ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 370 bhi lagaai he
 Which means buying and selling humans
 siarpisi 161 ke tahat die gaye bayanon main asaram ke gurgey or unke puraane sevadaar pehle hi asaram ke kai or karatuuton kaa khulaasa kar chuke hai
 And in the same revelations, Asaram has been accused of sexually abusing girls as well as possessing them and buying and selling them further
 vaise to 370 ke tahat saat saal tak kii sajaa mumkin thi, lekin ab child trephiking ke is maamle main tabdili ke baad iskaa gunahagaar paae jane par umr kaid bhi ho sakati he
 Section 354 of the IPC is included in the police charge sheet prepared against Asaram
 police kii maane to asaram ne peedit ladki ke saath chhedchhad ke silsile main marpet bhi kii thi
 And there are also accused of Asaram 354 under it
 isamen gunaah sabit hone par unhen 2 saal tak kii sajaa or jurmaana mumkin he
 While Asaram has also been imposed under section 34 of IPC and sub-section 349 of 509 for having vulgar and lewd talk with girls and women
 asaram par ipisi kii dhara 120 ke tahat sajeesh rachane, 342 ke tahat naaballig ladki ko jabaran apni kutiyaa main bandhak banane, 506 ke tahat peedit ladki or uske gharavaalon ko jaan se maarane kii dhamkee dene kaa bhi ilzaam he
 But along with sexual exploitation, the most serious charge is rape under Section 375 of IPC and Section 5 and 6 of POSCO
 iske mutabik police asaram ko bacchee ke saath zyaadati karne kaa gunahagaar bataa rahi he
 Even if these crimes are proved, Asaram could be sentenced to life imprisonment
 jodhpur police ne asaram ko unke har gunaah kii sajaa alag se dilwane kii puri taiyaari kar lee he
 In the charge sheet prepared against Asaram, the police have mentioned about ten sections
 inamen se kuch dharaaen to itani sangeen hai ki sabit hone par taumr jail se rihaai kii gunjaaish hi nahin bachati
 When Asaram's stars were at a height, the world would remain in his footsteps
 ab asaram ke sitare gardish main hai, to koi purasaanehaal nahin he
 The climax of the story of Asaram, who runs a black business of lawlessness under the guise of religion, is constantly coming closer, because now it is time to file a charge sheet

 According to Prakash Ambedkar, some people of Kopardi village itself do not want the eyewitnesses to come forward and give police testimony in this case, help
 isiilie ye shadyantr rachaa gaya ke jab prakaash ambedkar kochardy gaanv main aaye to unke khilaaf narebaaji kar ke, unhen gaanv main aane se roke
 According to Prakash Ambedkar, even though he does not go to Kopardi for the moment, he will definitely visit the victim's family after the atmosphere of the village has calmed down
