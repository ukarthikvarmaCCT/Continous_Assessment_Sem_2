 If you are preparing to make new factory in December, then you will definitely pay attention to whether a Fasttag device is installed on it
 centre sarkaar ne sabhi 4 pahiyon vaale vaahanon ke liye agle maheene se fasttag jaruri kar diya he

 Shravan Kumar served the parents

 vanvaas usko bheja ja saktaa he jiskaa pesha hi raajnneeti ho
 i have my own business, i have business, i will do it, it is not my exile

 Journalist Rohini Singh's news appeared in 'the Wire' that the BJP has received Rs 20 crore from three companies against whom the ED, the Enforcement Directorate is investigating in the case of Terror Funding
 in companiyon ke naam bijepi ne apni report main khud bataae hai
 Investigative agency ED is investigating against RKW Ltd
 that the company had helped another company involved in the process of purchasing the property of 1993 Mumbai blasts accused Iqbal Mirchi, in return for its former director Ranjit Bindra It was allegedly received a commission of 30 crores
 ikbaal mirchi daaud ibrahim kaa kareebi tha
 This company has given a donation of 10 crores to the BJP, which has been reported by the BJP to the Election Commission
 is baat kii jaankaree is saal janvari main 'cobrapost' ne apane khulaase main kii thi
 Rohini has written in her report that if the law of electoral bonds were to come in 2014-15, it would not be known how much money has been given by which company
 is report main do or companiyon kaa zikr he
 You can read the entire report by going to 'the Wire'
 is report ke aane ke baad bijepi kii koi thos pratikriya nahin ai
 Silence was achieved dekha janaa chahie ki is company ne kis-kis dal ko chanda diya he
 But when investigative journalist Nitin Sethi published his report on the new electoral bond in six episodes, Piyush Goyal gave a long answer in writing and verbally
 nitin sethi kii yah report elactoral bond ko samajhane ke liye padhi jaani chahie or agar aap hindi ke akhbaar padhate hai tab or gaur se padhein or dekhen ki hindi akhabaaron main kya aisi reporting hoti he? aakhir hindi kii duniya se is tarah kii reporting kaa saahas kyon khatm ho rahaa he, jabaki vahaan ek se ek kaabil patrkaar hai
 Nitin Sethi writes originally in English but his six-report series has appeared on the website of News Laundry in Hindi
 aap jaanate hai ki abhi tak 6000 karod ke elactoral bond kharide gaye hai or raajnneetik dalon ke paas paise aae hai
 According to the ADR report, out of the 222 crore bonds purchased in March 2018, 95 percent of the money went to the bjp's account
 nitin sethi kii pehali report kaaphi khatarnaak he
 The concept note that was initially made for electoral bonds was not made on an official letter pad but on plain paper
 na to sade kagaz par taarikh thi or na hi kisi kaa dastakhat
 Seeing this paper, former officials have told that someone has written from outside and its language does not seem to be of the officials
 1 farvari 2017 ko arun jetali bajet pesh karne vaale the, uske chaar din pehle reserve bank se raay maangi jaati he
 According to the reply of the then Revenue Secretary Hansmukh Adhia, the copy of the Finance Bill was printed by then
 phir bhi reserve bank elactoral bond ko lekar kai aapattiyaan darj karaata he, jise nazarandaaz kar diya jaataa he
 The Reserve Bank's objection was to secrecy, and the answer was that the purpose of securing donations is its purpose
 bajet pesh karne se chaar din pehle ek senior tex afasar ko kuch gadabadiyaan nazar aati hai
 That by electoral bonds, big corporations can disguise their identity and give unlimited money to political parties
 yah tabhi sambhav ho saktaa he jab bhartiya reserve bank ke adhinium main badlaav kiya jaae
 On the same day, the Finance Ministry sends an email to the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank seeking quick comment
 30 janvari 2017 ko reserve bank kahata he ki uske adhinium main sanshodhan se galat parampara shuru hogi
 Money laundering will increase
 paisa kisi teesri party kaa hoga or kharidne vaala koi or hoga
 This will not fulfill the goal of transparency
 tivi par aisi jatil prakriyaaon kii bahes mushkil he
 Many things come down from meditation
 phir bhi aap yun samajhie ki reserve bank kah rahaa he ki isamen paardarshita nahin he
 He is consulted four days before the Bill is introduced
 kaayade se aise vishay par pehle bhi raay lee ja sakati thi, jab vitt vidheyak nahin chapa tha
 It is obvious that the formality of taking opinion was being played, which has now been revealed by this report
 is report main note kiijie vitt mantralay kaa jawaab
 That the banks issuing the bonds will keep the information about the party buying and acquiring it completely secret
 ise artiai ke daayre se baahar rakhaa jayega
 Then how does this become transparency? On 1 February 2017, Arun Jaitley as Finance Minister declares the Electoral Fund and it becomes law
 kanoon banane ke baad chunaav ayog or reserve bank kii baithak bulaai jaati he, jisamen reserve bank shaamil nahin hota he
 After the bond is passed, foreign companies can now donate to Indian parties
 koi bhi company kitna bhi paisa daan de sakati he
 The validity of this bond was challenged in the Supreme Court and the final decision has not come
 nitin sethi ne sawaal uthaaya he ki videshi companiyon ko gupt rup se chanda dene kii chhot kyon di gai? nitin sethi ne apni report main har baat ke samarthan main dastauez pesh kiye hai
 Now all the documents have been made available to the public
 muft main, yani koi bhi jaanch saktaa he ki nitin sethi ke uthaae sawaal sahi hai yaa nahin? paardarshita ise kehete hai
 Such transparency is less visible in journalism that a journalist should make all his documents public
 is bond kaa ek khatarnaak pahalu bhi he
 Only the government knows who the company is donating to
 agar sarkaar ne dabaav daalkar virdohi dal ko chanda roak diya to? aakhir daan dene vaale kii pahchaan chhipaane ke peeche makasad kya he? phir jab rajyasabha main mohammad nadimul haq ne sawaal kiya gaya ki kya kisi ne elactoral bond ko lekar aapatti darj karai thi tab vitt rajya mantri radhakrishnan ne bolaa ki aapatti darj nahin karai, jabaki nitin sethi apni report main sabit karte hai ki aapattiyaan darj karai gai thim
 On behalf of the Reserve Bank and Election Commission
 baad main jab ritaryad camodor lokesh bataraa ne artiai ke zarie aapattiyon ke kaagazat nikaale tab sawaal poochne vaale saansad haq ne visheshadhikari ke hanan kaa maamla darj kiya lekin iske baad bhi vitt rajya mantri apane pehle ke jawaab par ade rahe
 While the document is in front
 rigerv bank or chunaav ayog donon ne aapatti darj karai thi
 After the Electoral Bonds were passed in Parliament, the Election Commission had told the Ministry of Law and Justice in writing that through electoral bonds, political parties would be able to hide illegal donations from foreign sources
 sandigdh chanda dene vaala shell companiyaan bana legaa or kaala dhan raajnneetik dalon main khapa degaa
 The true source of money will never be revealed
 ayog chahta tha ki elactoral bond waapas liya jaae
 The Law Ministry referred these objections to the Finance Ministry
 vitt mantralay ne andekha kar diya
 Nevertheless, by the end of October 2018, the Election Commission kept talking about withdrawal of electoral bonds
 iske liye kai baar reminder bhi bheja lekin vitt mantralay ne andekha kar diya
 Even then, the Minister of State for Finance says in Parliament that no one objected
 janvari 2019 main vitt rajya mantri radhakrishnan ko apane pehle ke jawaab main ek galati sweekaar kerani padi thi
 Later Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman admitted that the Election Commission had registered objections, but did not answer MP Haq's question as to what the government did to address those objections
 Keep in mind that no matter how much a company can donate and who will give it, it will not record in its books
 uske liye aisa karnaa zaruri nahin he
 After all, when companies tell each one of their money to institutions like SEBI, why will they not tell whom they have donated with their money? Why is it being kept secret? Is this being done to make black money white? Looking at the documents that Nitin Sethi has presented in his report, it seems that the Finance Ministry is continuously rejecting all objections
 koi farji company banaakar kitna bhi chanda de saktaa he isaki ashanka par thos karrwai kyon nahin hoti he? nitin sethi kii report ke baad piyush goyal ne press conference kii
 He also released his statement in writing
 vaanijya mantri piyush goyal ne pichley guuruuvaar kii press conference main jo daawey kiye the us par hafington post kii report main sawaal uthaae gaye hai
 Like he said that the bonds have to be cashed within 15 days, but after the end of the Karnataka assembly elections in May 2018, the bond of 10 crores was lost
 to ek raajnneetik dal ke pratinidhi ne state bank par dabaav daalaa ki bond ko cash hone de
 The Finance Ministry succumbed to that pressure
 nitin sethi ne apni report main dikhaaya he ki chunaav se das din pehle pradhanmantri karyaalay kii taraf se aadesh aata he ki ek windo kholaa jaae or bond ko cash kiya jaae
 The question is the same: how is this transparent system when the name of the donor is confidential? On 2 May 2017, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley sought opinion from opposition parties on this
 congress kii taraf se motilal bora ne likhaa tha, 'main samajhataa hum ki sarkaar raajnneetik dalon kii chunavi funding par paardarshita ke mudde par chintit he
 Transparency implies that the voter should know three things
 ek chanda dene vaala koun he? do, kis raajnneetik party ko chanda diya ja rahaa he or teen chande kii raashi kya he?motilal vora ne bhi yahi kaha tha ki chanda dene vaale kaa naam bank ko pataa hoga yani sarkaar ko pataa hoga, lekin aam janata ko nahin
 CPI general secretary Sudhakar Reddy opposed the government's proposal regarding donations
 akali dal ne badhai di thi or mayawati ne saraahna kii thi
 This news went backwards due to Maharashtra, but the opposition party, especially the Congress, had asked many questions to the government after the report came

 Paytm par credit card se tranjaction karte hai to ab aapke liye chijen badal jaaengi
 Because the company has announced to take 2% tax on loading money from credit card to Paytm wallet
 reports ke mutabik aisa isliye kiya gaya he kyonki yugers credit card se petm par paise lod karke apane bank acount main us paise ko bina tranjaction cost ke transfar karte hai
 However, on loading the money from the credit card, users will get as many cashbacks as they will be deducted
 ye cashbek coupon ke taur par die jaaenge jinhen petm yaa kuch duusare limited eps par yuj kiye ja sakate hai
 But it is not clear how long this cashback offer is for
 yani agar cashbek ofer khatm hua to taiyaar ho jaaen 2 fisadi tex dene ke liye
 According to the official blog post of Paytm, when users use credit cards, Paytm gives money to the bank for this
 yani yujar jab credit card se petm par paise lod karke use bank main transfar karata he to isse unhen nuksaan hota he
 Paytm has accused people who are employees of a financial institution or who understand such transactions better
 company ke mutabik wo credit karj ke jariye petm kaa paisa laga kar paise rotate karte the
 The blog reads, 'we are making some changes to our terms to prevent miss use
 agar aap credit card yaa kisi pement opshan ke jariye kuch kharidenge yaa bill pe karente to is par koi charge nahin lagegaa, lekin credit card se wolet main paise lod karne par paise do fisadi kaa charge lagegaa’yani aap credit card se richarge kar sakate hai, lekin paise lod karnaa ghate kaa sauda ho saktaa he
 This 2 per cent charge has been implemented from 8 March

 Tendulkar said India's bowling was very strong and it was a good combination with so much variety
 tendulkar, kapil dev or manoj prabhakar jaise tej gendbaajon ke saath khel chuke hai
 For most part of this veteran batsman's career, Javagal Srinath and Zaheer Khan were the spearheads of India's fast bowling attack

 kuch aise he jo swing gendbaaji kaa acchhee tarah saamana karte hai or kuch main pich se move hone vaali gendon se nipatane kii takanic he
 You have to choose the team keeping all these in mind
 ’test or ekadivasiy cricket main sarvaadhik ran banane vaale tendulkar ne bhubaneshwar kii tarifon ke pul baandhte hue kaha ki vah apni alround kshamta se bharat kii sthiti majboot kar sakate hai
 He said, 'india's current team is constantly focusing on such fast bowlers who can contribute well with the bat
 mujhe lagata he ki ye do khilaadi (bhubaneshwar or hardik) ranon kaa mahatvapurn yogadan dete rahe hai
 Bhuvi's strong praise, said, "hardik has just made a place in the team but i think Bhuvi made a great contribution and this changed the balance of the team positively
" ’ unhone kaha, ‘aisa ballebaaj hona acha he jo chaar se paanch over gendbaaji kar sake, lekin isse bhi acha yah he ki aisa gendbaaj ho jo mahatvapurn ran bana sake
 Contribution that can help you move forward

 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki jaldi janaa phaayde kii sthiti sabit hogi
 By the start of the Test series, India would have spent five months in England and had practiced a lot of matches

 The results of the by-elections in Jind in Haryana and Ramgarh assembly seat in Rajasthan are being declared today
 donon siton par congress or bhartiya janata party main kaante kaa muqabla he
 By-elections have been held in Jind while elections could not be held with the remaining seats due to the demise of the candidate in Ramgarh, Rajasthan
 ise lekar partiyon ne jaisi teji dikhaai he or chunaav prachaar main jaisaa shakti pradarshan kiya gaya he, usase saaf he ki partiyaan or uske netaa nateezon ko halke main nahin lenge
 # Haryana: Congress's Randeep Surjewala and Jannayak Janata Party's Digvijay Chautala present at the counting center in # Jindas counting of votes has begun

 com / mt9ppyjzap— ANI (@ani)january 31, 2019congress ne jind se apane bade netaa randeep singh surajevaala ko maidan main utaara he
 The Lok Sabha elections are to be held in month or two, so the parties will link their victory with Qila Fatah and its direct connection with takht-o-taj of Delhi
 baat sabase pehle jind kii
 By-elections were held here on 28 January
 voting main umadi bheed ko dekhakar andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki vidhansabha main jab aisa josh rahaa, to phir loksabhaa main kya hoga
 See the details of the seat, 1 in Jind constituency
 7 lakh panjikrut voter hai jinamein se anusuchit jati (essi) or pichhadaa varg (obisi) kaa lagbhag 50 pratishat hissaa he
 Jats account for about 25 percent of the vote
 philhal is seat par indian lokdal kaa kabja he
 In the recent months, the way the Congress has connected the BJP with the upper castes, the rich, the industrialists and tried to woo the SC, ST, OBC, it is clear that the Congress has high hopes from Jind
 tabhi usne apane media prabharee or kaithal se vidhayak randeep surajevaala ko jind main utaara he
 However, this fight is not so easy as it has been the betel seat of INLD
 phir bhi congress bijepi kii satta virdohi lahar main khud kii jeet or inelo kii haar dekh rahi he
 This by-election is also important because there will be assembly elections in Haryana this year and the win-loss equation will be seen directly related to Jind
 kah sakate hai yah upachunaav maidan main utre sabhi chaar partiyon sattarudh bijepi, congress, inelo or nai bani party jananaayak janata party (jejepi) ke liye ek agnipariksha he
 Surjewala's bets seem a bit heavy as he had earlier defeated INLD supremo Om Prakash Chautala
 in saare factor ke baavjood jejepi ko 'kingmekar' mana ja rahaa he kyonki inelo or congress ko pataa he ki jejepi uske vot kaategi
 The technical aspect of this is that the Aam Aadmi Party has not fielded any candidate but has supported the JJP
 haryana se sate dilli main aam aadmi party kii chhavi acchhee he, isliye jaankaron ke mutabik use achche vot mil sakate hai
 Here the reference to good vote is from the cut votes of BJP, Congress and INLD
 chunaav prachaar main arvind kejariwal bhi gaye the or jejepi pratyaashee digvijay chautaala ke liye vot maanga tha
 The by-election was held due to the death of INLD MLA Dr Harichand Middha
 maidan main kul 21 ummidavaar hai lekin muqabla 4 pratyaashiyon ke bich he
 Krishna Middha is the candidate from BJP
 unke pita harichand midhdha yahaan se vidhayak the
 Now the talk of Ramgarh by-election in Rajasthan
 is seat par voting pehle 7 disambar 2018 ko hone vaali thi lekin ain chunaav ke pehle bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ke ummidavaar lakshmana singh kaa nidhan ho jane ke baad ise taalna padaa
 There are 20 candidates in the fray, but the real fight is between Safia Zubair Khan of Congress, Sukhwant Singh of BJP and Jagat Singh of BSP
 rajasthan main kisaan matadaataaon kii sankhya sabase adhik he or congress ne haal ke vidhansabha chunaav main karjamaafee kar unka dil jeeta he, isliye uskaa palada baari dikhaai detaa he
 However his Jat factor is weak
 congress ke paas koi jat cheharaa aisa nahin he jo apane kshetra asar rakhata ho, jabaki rajasthan main jat matadaata prabhavi or mukhar he
 The impact of Ramgarh can also be seen
 congress ke saath plus point yah he ki haal main beete vidhansabha chunaav main use banpar vot mili or bijepi kii sarkaar jaati rahi
 The Congress got 99 seats in 199 seats and its ally Rashtriya Lok Dal one seat
 bijepi yahaan 73 siton par simat gai
 BSP won 6 mlas and 13 Independents
 in sabhi vidhayakon ne mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ko samarthan diya he
 This support may impact Ramgarh by-election

 He also gave suggestions of happy life to the children and also gave information about determination, hard work and success to earn success
 unhone safalataa ke liye parishram ke mahatv par bhi prakaash daalaa
 He said that there is nothing impossible but continuous honest effort is necessary

 film nirdeshak vishaal bharadwaj ne geetkaar-nirdeshak gulzaar ke saath apni pakistan yatra ko adhuraa chhodkar laut aane ke peeche kisi raajnneetik kaaran ke hone se inkaar kiya he
 Director Vishal Bhardwaj has issued a statement clarifying that there is no political reason for his return to Pakistan with Gulzar leaving him incomplete
 bharadwaj ke bayaan main kaha gaya he ki vah apni nai film 'dedh ishkia' ke ek gane kii recording ke liye pakistan gaye the
 During that time, Gulzar Saheb visited the tomb of his mentor and famous poet Ahmed Nadeem Kasami and after that he also visited his birthplace Dina after about 70 years
 vah vahaan jaakar kaaphi bhavuk ho gaye the or jab ham lahore ke hotel main laute, tab vah kaaphi asahaj mahasoos kar rahe the
 For this reason we canceled the recording and left the journey incomplete and brought them back to Hindustan
 jaise hi gulzaar sahab acha mahasoos karne lagenge, ham pakistan dobaaraa jaaenge
 The comments darasal, gulzaar ko shuukravaar ko shuru hone ja rahe karachi sahitya mahotsav main bhaag lenaa tha, jiske udghaatan samaaroh main vah pramukh vaktaa ke rup main shaamil hone vaale the
 Discussions then began that he was advised by the Indian High Commission to return to India, although the High Commission issued a statement denying that he had any role in Gulzar's return leaving the trip incomplete

 The Indian High Commission in Islamabad had no knowledge of his program nor was he advised by the High Commission to return
 bayaan main aage kaha gaya ki darasal, ucchayog kaa unase koi sampark nahin tha

 What can be the best measure to measure the success of democracy? Let us move from the results to the policies
 yah safar hamen naukarshahi, kriyanvayan, monitering ke padaavon se gujaarte hue vidhayika kii dahalij par le jaakar khadaa kar degaa
 We will find ourselves standing at the doorstep of the Parliament or the Legislative Assembly, from where the laws emerge
 loktantr main sarkarein kitni safal hoti hai, yah is baat par nirbhar karata he ki unke kanoon kitne suvichaarit or doordarshee hai
 Obviously, the quality of the laws depends on the efficiency of the legislatures, that is, the competence of our law makers — mps and mlas
 do taaje udhaaharan hamen bharat main vidhaayi dakshata kii sthiti par sochane ko majaboor karte hai
 The first is the Insolvency and Bankruptcy (bankruptcy) Act, which has undergone major changes through ordinance within a year
 pichley saal disambar se lagu hua kanoon biimaar companiyon ke punargathan or bakaayaa bank karj kii vasuuli ke liye aadhunik, twarit kanoonee prakriya lekar aayaa tha
 This reform was necessary to make the investment environment sustainable and prevent misuse of bank loans
 isi kanoon ke chalate haal main kaarobaari sahajata main bharat kii ranking behatar hui
 As soon as the law was implemented, the government came to know that it can be exploited and can have political damage, so now it has been made headlong
 bahes jari he ki ab yah kanoon bainkon va companiyon ke kitne kaam kaa bachaa he or iske baad karj vasuuli or biimaar companiyon ke punargathan kii prakriya main kaise teji bani rahegi
 The bigger issue than the technical debate on amendment is why such a big change was needed in just one year
 The history of the law dealing with sick companies in the country (SICA Act, Company Law, SARFAESI Act, Debt Collection Tribunal) and such cases is ample experience but even then why we could not make a perfect bankruptcy law? GST legislative efficiency condition
 jiesti bhi kareeb ek dashak se ban rahaa he taaki upabhoktaaon or udyog par karon kaa boj kam kiya ja sake, kar pranali aasaan banaai ja sake or zyada karadaata tex daayre main aa saken
 But within three months of its formation, the GST was dismantled
 tex rate ulat-palat ho gaye or is dauraan niyam itane badale ki unhen yaad rakhana mushkil ho gaya
 The failure of GST has deeply hurt India's indirect tax structure
 indirect tex ko lekar bhi tajurbon kii kami nahin he
 VAT and service tax have been applied
 waite yani vailu aded tex ko amal main laane main vakt laga tha lekin vah jiesti se zyada tikaoo sabit hua
 The needs and challenges of GST were completely clear
 rajnatik sahmati bhi thi lekin lambey intjaar ke baad bhi hamaare kanoon nirmaataa hamen ek kaayade kaa jiesti nahin de paae
 The list of legal and policy failures can be prolonged which will further broaden the questions arising on the efficiency of the legislature
 chunavi dabaavon ke kaaran nae bane kanoonon kaa aisa shirshasana (jiesti, bankerptsi) anokhaa he
 By the time the Parliament enacts laws, it is too late to consider these changes
 bharat main vidhaayi akushalta badhati ja rahi he
 Fresh experiences give us four conclusions: 1
 sarkaar kanoon banane se pehle paryaapt shodh nahin kar rahi he, nahin to jiesti va bankerptsi code kaa yah haal nahin hota
 2
 kanoon se prabhavit hone vaale pakshon se samvaad nahin hota
 Politicians consider themselves omniscient

 Party workers have taken a unique way to invite people to the second 'vijay Shankhanad rally' of bjp's Kerendra Modi, in Bundelkhand and Veerangana Rani Lakshmibai's Tapobhumi Jhansi
 yah anuthi pahal haalanki vartmaan peedi ke liye nai baat ho sakati he, lekin anadi kaal se hi shubh kaary main aagantukon ko bulaane ke liye pilaa akshat (chaaval) bheje jane kii bhartiya parampara rahi he
 The number of visitors to Semodi's rally in this unique invitation of BJP is likely to increase significantly
 bijepi samarthakon kaa kahana he ki yahi ek aisi party he jo bhartiya parampara ko bachaa sakati he, saath hi desh ko shashakt va samruddhi ke raste par le ja sakati he
 Some people of the city also believe that this way of invitation has not only increased the affinity of the BJP but also increased the affinity
 itnaa hi nahin, jo is party kaa pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se virodh karte hai, ve bhi bijepi dwaara bheje gaye pile akshat ko sweekaar kar rahe hai or raily main aane kaa vaada kar rahe hai
 Jyotishacharya Pt, hailing from Jhansi
 sanjay ne bataaya, 'hamaari bhartiya parampara main sanathan dharm kaa pratik he peetaambar

 'unhone bataaya ki brahma rajogun yani peetaambar, vishnu satogun yani shwetambar tathaa bhagwaan shankar tamogun yani raktambar ke pratik hai
 He said that in Vedic tradition, Akshat has a lot of significance

 By putting a picture of Rani Laxmibai on Modi's platform, the party has also tried to send a message to the opposition that in India the great men and revolutionaries will not be allowed to be insulted and the party will also support their dreams
 is anokhe nimantran par party ke media prabharee manish shukla ne kaha ki virangana rani lakshmibai kii is dharti se vipakshiyon ko modi kii takat kaa ahsaas hoga
 This unique initiative only means that the country needs an antibiotic, ie turmeric like Modi bhai, to get out of the current state of shabbiness

 It is noteworthy that three years ago, the Directorate of Estates under the Ministry of Urban Development had canceled the allotment of four bungalows by sending notice to the Congress

 In Haryana, RK Anand, the inld-backed candidate of Rajya Sabha, lost the election and the Congress MLA from Haryana played a major role in this defeat

 lekin 10 janpath se aashirwad praapt bhupinder singh huda or 11 tughlaq len tak pahunch rakhane vaale surajevaala kii ‘integrity’ par koi sawaal nahin uthaa saktaa
 There were also two factions in Haryana Congress regarding RK Anand
 ek naveen jindal kaa jo anand ko sirf isliye chahta tha taaki apane kattar dushman subhash chandra kaa rasta roka ja sake
 The battle between the two is well known in the coal mine case
 zee news kii taraf se camere par 100 karod kii ugaahi kaa sting oparation or phir zee patrkaar kaa jail janaa aadi sabane aag main ghi daalaa
 Jindal even fought to the point that even the license of Zee News came on
 naam tak badalanaa padaa
 But at the same time, Congress leader and former Chief Minister of the state Bhupinder Singh Hooda was always swayed by Subhash Chandra
 kehete hai ki dushman kaa dushman dost hota he
 Hooda is not made up of Naveen Jindal and Naveen Jindal's enmity with Subhash Chandra
 to aise main dosti kaa ek or sira judata he
 Many Congress leaders also remember the days when Subhash Chandra was considered close to Rajiv Gandhi
 haalanki ve baad main alag ho gaye lekin phir alag hone kaa afsos bhi jataayaa
 a senior Congress leader even said in an informal conversation that the doors of 10 Janpath are always open for Sushabha Chandra
 ve jab chahen mil sakate hai
 But the compulsion in front of Subhash Chandra was that how would he forward his lota in front of Congress on the same ghat where he was drinking water with BJP
 haalanki sutron ne bataaya ki 10 janpath ke qareebi netaaon ke saath chandra tach main the
 Information also came that Amar Singh came to meet Rahul Gandhi himself on 6th or 7th to defend Subhash Chandra
 congress yaa rahul gandhi ke daftar ne is baat kii tasdik nahin kii
 Now the question is why the Congress snatched food even after placing a plate in front of RK Anand
 jawaab sidhaa sa he
 What does RK Anand have to avenge the favor of Congress and what does Subhash Chandra have
 aarake anand ke paas vaqaalat kii qabiliyat he jisapar bmdablyoo cese maamle main sting kaa dank lag chukaa he
 In that sting of NDTV, when RK Anand was found guilty in court, then the Congress expelled him from the party
 kuch congressi ye bhi yaad kar bataate hai ki nikaale jane se naaraaz aarake anand ne sidhe 10 janpath par sawaal uthaae the
 This can also be seen as an argument against Anand
 duusari taraf subhash chandra ke paas lanbaa chaudaa media network he
 The question was also whether Subhash Chandra announced the line of BJP and Modi
 to chandra ke chaahane waalon ne use is tark se kaata ki chandra kii naaraazgi jindal kii vajah he
 And because they have entered politics, they also know that there is no permanent friend or permanent enemy in it
 kai congressiyon kii nazar main chandra apana rukh badalane ke liye jane jate hai
 Apart from the media, Subhash Chandra has many businesses for which he has to keep pace with the power
 tippaniyan Whatever the reasoning within the party, the result of the election is enough to tell that the Congress wanted Chandra
 nahin to khud purv mukhyamantri ne to ballat khaali choda hi, ol india congress kamity ke media chairman randeep singh surajevaala jo ki rahul kii team main bhi shumaar maane jate hai, kaa vot bhi radd ho gaya
 Now whatever technical explanation comes on it, but it is not the case that all these Congress mlas were voting for the Rajya Sabha for the first time that a mistake was made
 aane vaale dinon main do baton par nazar rahegi
 If the Hooda camp revolts, then the Gandhi family will crack down on them
 rahul gandhi ke khaas main shumaar ho chuke surajevaala kii sthiti kamazor hogi
 If he is going to get the post of General Secretary in Team Rahul then he will not get it
 media cell ke chairman pad se hataa diya jayega
 And accordingly the other mlas will also be beaten
 ye sahi he ki gandhi parivaar kii khud kii sthiti abhi itani dawandol he ki koi bhi kuch bhi suna ke nikal jaataa he
 But no one can question the 'integrity' of Bhupinder Singh Hooda, blessed with 10 Janpath and Surjewala having access to 11 Tughlaq lanes
 lekin vahiin congress ke kaddavar netaa or rajya ke mukhyamantri rah chuke bhupinder singh huda kii subhash chandra se hameshaa se chhanati rahi
 It is said that the enemy of an enemy is a friend
 hooda kii naveen jindal se nahin banati or naveen jindal kii subhash chandra ke dushmani
 So in this way another point of friendship is added
 congress ke kai netaa un dinon kii bhi yaad dilaate hai jab subhash chandra rajeev gandhi ke nazadikiyon main gine jate the
 Though they later separated, but again expressed their regret of separation
 congress ke ek bade netaa ne anaupchaarik baatcheet main yahaan tak kah diya ki sushabh chandra ke liye das janpath ke darvaaze hameshaa khule hai
 They can meet whenever they want
 lekin subhash chandra ke saamne kii majaburi ye thi ki jis ghat par ve bijepi ke saath pani pi rahe the usee ghat par ve congress ke saamne aapnaa lotaa kaise aage karte
 However, sources said that Chandra was in touch with close to 10 Janpath leaders
 jaankaree ye bhi ai ki subhash chandra kii pairvi karne amar singh 6 yaa 7 taarikh ko khud rahul gandhi se milane pahunche
 The Congress or Rahul Gandhi's office did not approve of this
 ab sawaal he ki aakhir congress ne aarake anand ke saamne thali rakh kar bhi khaanaa kyon chin liya
 The answer is simple
 aarake anand ke paas congress ke ehsaan kaa badla chukaane ke liye kya he or subhash chandra ke paas kya
 RK Anand has legal capacity, which has stinged in the BMW case
 enditivi ke us sting main jab court main aarake anand doshi paae gaye the to uske baad congress ne unhen party se nikaal baahar kiya tha
 Some Congressmen also recall that angry RK Anand directly questioned 10 Janpath because of the removal
 ye baat bhi anand ke khilaaf tark ke taur par dekha ja saktaa he
 Subhash Chandra, on the other hand, has a wide media network
 sawaal ye bhi tha ki subhash chandra to ghoshit taur par bijepi or modi kii line lete hai
 So Chandra's fans cut him off with the argument that Chandra's heartburn is the reason for Jindal
 or kyonki ve raajnneeti main kadam rakh chuke hai to ve bhi jaanate hai ki isamen koi permanent dost yaa permanent dushman nahin hota
 Chandra is known to change his stand in the eyes of many Congressmen
 media ke alaava subhash chandra ke kai bijness hai jiske liye unhen satta ke saath talmail bitha kar chalanaa padataa he

 It is true that the condition of the Gandhi family itself is so turbulent that anyone can hear anything
 lekin 10 janpath se aashirwad praapt bhupinder singh huda or 11 tughlaq len tak pahunch rakhane vaale surajevaala kii ‘integrity’ par koi sawaal nahin uthaa saktaa
 Many Congress leaders also remember the days when Subhash Chandra was considered close to Rajiv Gandhi
 haalanki ve baad main alag ho gaye lekin phir alag hone kaa afsos bhi jataayaa
 a senior Congress leader even said in an informal conversation that the doors of 10 Janpath are always open for Sushabha Chandra
 ve jab chahen mil sakate hai
 But the compulsion in front of Subhash Chandra was that how would he forward his lota in front of Congress on the same ghat where he was drinking water with BJP
 haalanki sutron ne bataaya ki 10 janpath ke qareebi netaaon ke saath chandra tach main the
 Information also came that Amar Singh came to meet Rahul Gandhi himself on 6th or 7th to defend Subhash Chandra
 congress yaa rahul gandhi ke daftar ne is baat kii tasdik nahin kii
 Now the question is why the Congress snatched food even after placing a plate in front of RK Anand
 jawaab sidhaa sa he
 What does RK Anand have to avenge the favor of Congress and what does Subhash Chandra have
 aarake anand ke paas vaqaalat kii qabiliyat he jisapar bmdablyoo cese maamle main sting kaa dank lag chukaa he
 In that sting of NDTV, when RK Anand was found guilty in court, then the Congress expelled him from the party
 kuch congressi ye bhi yaad kar bataate hai ki nikaale jane se naaraaz aarake anand ne sidhe 10 janpath par sawaal uthaae the
 This can also be seen as an argument against Anand
 duusari taraf subhash chandra ke paas lanbaa chaudaa media network he
 The question was also whether Subhash Chandra announced the line of BJP and Modi
 to chandra ke chaahane waalon ne use is tark se kaata ki chandra kii naaraazgi jindal kii vajah he
 And because they have entered politics, they also know that there is no permanent friend or permanent enemy in it
 kai congressiyon kii nazar main chandra apana rukh badalane ke liye jane jate hai
 Apart from the media, Subhash Chandra has many businesses for which he has to keep pace with the power
 tippaniyan Whatever the reasoning within the party, the result of the election is enough to tell that the Congress wanted Chandra
 nahin to khud purv mukhyamantri ne to ballat khaali choda hi, ol india congress kamity ke media chairman randeep singh surajevaala jo ki rahul kii team main bhi shumaar maane jate hai, kaa vot bhi radd ho gaya
 Now whatever technical explanation comes on it, but it is not the case that all these Congress mlas were voting for the Rajya Sabha for the first time that a mistake was made
 aane vaale dinon main do baton par nazar rahegi
 If the Hooda camp revolts, then the Gandhi family will crack down on them
 rahul gandhi ke khaas main shumaar ho chuke surajevaala kii sthiti kamazor hogi
 If he is going to get the post of General Secretary in Team Rahul then he will not get it
 media cell ke chairman pad se hataa diya jayega
 And accordingly the other mlas will also be beaten
 ye sahi he ki gandhi parivaar kii khud kii sthiti abhi itani dawandol he ki koi bhi kuch bhi suna ke nikal jaataa he
 But no one can question the 'integrity' of Bhupinder Singh Hooda, blessed with 10 Janpath and Surjewala having access to 11 Tughlaq lanes
 ab sawaal he ki aakhir congress ne aarake anand ke saamne thali rakh kar bhi khaanaa kyon chin liya
 The answer is simple
 aarake anand ke paas congress ke ehsaan kaa badla chukaane ke liye kya he or subhash chandra ke paas kya
 RK Anand has legal capacity, which has stinged in the BMW case
 enditivi ke us sting main jab court main aarake anand doshi paae gaye the to uske baad congress ne unhen party se nikaal baahar kiya tha
 Some Congressmen also recall that angry RK Anand directly questioned 10 Janpath because of the removal
 ye baat bhi anand ke khilaaf tark ke taur par dekha ja saktaa he
 Subhash Chandra, on the other hand, has a wide media network
 sawaal ye bhi tha ki subhash chandra to ghoshit taur par bijepi or modi kii line lete hai
 So Chandra's fans cut him off with the argument that Chandra's heartburn is the reason for Jindal
 or kyonki ve raajnneeti main kadam rakh chuke hai to ve bhi jaanate hai ki isamen koi permanent dost yaa permanent dushman nahin hota
 Chandra is known to change his stand in the eyes of many Congressmen
 media ke alaava subhash chandra ke kai bijness hai jiske liye unhen satta ke saath talmail bitha kar chalanaa padataa he
 The comments party ke bheetar ke tark vitark chaahe jo bhi rahe hon, chunaav kaa parinaam ye bataane ko kaaphi he ki congress ne chandra ko hi chaha
 Otherwise, the former Chief Minister himself left the ballot empty, the vote of Randeep Singh Surjewala, the media chairman of All India Congress Committee, who is also considered as one of Rahul's team, was also canceled
 ab is par takneekee safai jo bhi aae lekin aisa nahin he ki congress ke ye tamaam vidhayak pehali baar rajyasabha ke liye vot kar rahe the ki galati ho gai
 In the coming days, two things will be watched
 agar jo huda kheme ne baghaavat kii to gandhi parivaar un par nakel kasega
 The position of Surjewala, who has been included in Rahul Gandhi's special, will be weak
 agar team rahul main unako mahasachiv kaa pad milane vaala he to wo nahin milegaa

 Private schools in Delhi have reached the Delhi High Court against the government's order to abolish the management quota
 hoicourt privet skulon kii yachika par guruuvar ko yani aaj sunwaayee karegaa
 Significantly, the private schools are angry over the elimination of management quota
 nursery admician: court ja sakate hai 298 privet skool!bataa den ki pichley ek dashak se bhi zyada ho chukaa he lekin abhi bhi nursery admician ko lekar privet skulon or sarkaar ke bich koi aisa rasta nahin nikal paaya he, jisase nursery admician kaa koi sthai rasta nikal paae
 Rather it has become more complicated for the last 3 -4 years
 is saal dilli sarkaar ne notification nikaalkar nursery admician ke liye guidelins tay kar di thi or privet skulon kii ection cameti ne dilli sarkaar ke is notification ko hai court me chunauti dete hue yachika laga di he
 Nursery Admission: Management quota in 298 private schools finished in Delhi may come today
 Decision court will hear this petition today
 darasal didie se jameen lij par lete vakt skulon ko un ilaake ke bacchon ko daakhile main praathamikta dene ke baat kahi gai thi
 Schools say that they have been adhering to the Neighborhood Criteria in admissions already, but if other criterias like Sibling, Alumnae are completely ignored, both the school and the parent will face difficulties
 lekin sarkaar chaahati he ki privet skool 75% open seat par nebarhud ke bacchon ko anivaary rup se daakhil den
 This decision of the government has been challenged by the schools in the Delhi High Court
 rape cese main aaropeedati maharajaki mushkilen kam hoti najar nahin aa rahi hai
 Hearing the petition filed by the victim in the Delhi High Court on Wednesday, the case has been transferred to CBI for investigation
 darasal court dilli police kii taraf se haal hi main file kii gai chargeshit se bhi santusht nahin dikhaa
 That is why the CBI has been ordered to file a supplementary charge sheet in this case
 court main chargeshit par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki is maamle main 4 darjan se upar mahilaon kii gavaahi police ne unke ghar jaakar darj kii he
 It is possible that Dati Maharaj may have tried to intimidate her after her statement was recorded
 court kaa sawaal tha ki peedita ne jab apane bayaan 164 main darj kara die the to abhi tak is maamle main daati maharaj kii giraftaar kyon nahin hui
 a rape case was registered with Delhi Police on behalf of the victim in this case against Dati Maharaj
 peedita kaa kahana tha janvari or march 2016 main daati maharaj ne uske saath balaatkaar kiya
 The victim, in her FIR, has also accused five more people for supporting and conspiring with Daati Maharaj in the rape incident
 ab jab is maamle mendilli hoicourtne cese sibiai ko transfar kar diya he to puri jaanch dobaaraa sibiai ko kerani hogi
 After investigation, the CBI will have to submit its charge sheet to the Delhi High Court
 sibiai kii jaanch se yah bhi saaf hoga ki ab tak kii dilli police kii krime branch kii jaanch main kya-kya gadabadi or kamiyaan rahi hai
 Last week, Delhi Police filed its charge sheet in Saket court on rape charges, describing Nedati Maharaj as the main accused
 lekin hoicourt ne sabase bada sawaal yahi uthaaya ki ab tak itane sangeen aaropon ke baavjood daati maharaj kii giraftaar kyon nahin ho saki
 It is possible that the arrest of Dati Maharaj may also be possible as the CBI broadens the scope of its investigation
 peedita ne aarope lagaaya kidaati maharajake kai bade netaaon or beurocrates ke saath ghanishtha sambandh rahe hai or isiilie uski giraftaar is maamle main ab tak nahin ho pai he
 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president Amit Shah made a big announcement just before the Lok Sabha elections
 unhone kaha he ki party main jin netaaon kii umr 75 saal se zyada he, unhen koi jimmedaari nahin di jaaegi
 Inaugurating the 'bharat ki Mann ki Baat' campaign in Delhi on Sunday, Amit Shah said this while speaking about the development work done during the tenure of Modi government
 darasal, is campan ke jariye bijepi ke kaaryakarta deshbhar main 7 hajaar box lagaayenge or kareeb 10 karod pariwaron se raay maangi jaaegi
 These families will be asked how they want India and then their opinion will be included in the election resolution letter
 dilli main ravivaar ko is abhiyaan kaa aarambh karte hue amit shah ne bhartiya janata party ke aantarik loktantr kii tarif kii, or aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ko lekar umradraj netaaon par bhi bayaan diya
 He said that leaders who have crossed the age of 75 years will not be given the responsibility to do any kind of work
 haalanki, jab unase sawaal kiya gaya ki kya aise netaa aagaamee chunaav lard paaenge yaa nahin, to is par unhone kuch spasht jawaab nahin diya or charchaa kiye jane kii baat kahi
 Let us know that even before the age limit, there have been reports of ban on Amit Shah contesting the election
 haalanki, baad main aisi charchaaon ko darkinar karte hue 75 saal se zyada umr ke netaaon ko tikat bhi die gaye
 But this issue was related to the assembly elections
 ab jabaki loksabhaa chunaav hone ja rahe hai, aise main amit shah kaa yah bayaan kaaphi mahatvapurn mana ja rahaa he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party currently has many mps, including LK Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi, Shanta Kumar, Karia Munda, Liladhar Vaghela and Prabhat Singh Chauhan, who are currently members of the Lok Sabha and have crossed 75
 aise main agar party 75 saal se zyada umr vaale netaaon ke chunaav ladane sambandhi koi faisla leti he to us fehrist main ye naam bhi dekhne ko mil sakate hai
 Happy Mahashivratri
 Maha Shivratri greetings to everyone

 sonakshi par die gaye coment ko lekar unhone kaha ki sabase pehle to main ye kahana chaahati hum ki trobers ke paas jindagi main kuch bhi acha karne ke liye nahin he to isliye wo ye sab harakatein karte hai
 People should understand that i was heavily body shamed at the beginning of my career when i had lost 30 kg at that time and what Akshay has said is that he must have said in response to the same shaming
 unhen samajhnaa chahie ki meri or akshay kii acchhee dosti hai or ham donon ke saath bhi kaaphi comfortable he to wo ek dost ke bare main baat kar rahe hai, kisi raah chalate shaks ke bare main baat nahin kar rahe the

 ) It is being said that President Barack Obama of the world's most powerful country, along with wife Michelle Obama, came as special guests at the Republic Day celebrations
 lekin is daure ke peeche kai aise raaj bhi hai jise jaanakar aap hairaan ho jaaenge
 Let us tell you some of the secrets which we have come to know from special sources
 1
 Why did not come from daughters? It has been learned that Obama's daughters did not actually come to India due to fear of Narendra Modi
 kyonki haal hi main modi ne betiyon ko padhaane ko lekar bayaan die hai or aise main agal obama bich satr main skool se chuttee dilaakar betiyon ko bharat laate to dar tha kahin modi airport par hi unhen bacchiyon kii padhai main baadha banane ke liye daptne lag jate
 The second reason was told that Malia did not want anyone to consider her Alia Bhatt's sister
 saath hi donon bahanon ne brazil daure par narendra modi ko laad main bachche ke kaan umethte bhi dekha tha or tabase bharat aane ke naam par hi unhen haad kaa bukhaar aa jaataa he
 Amidst these rumors, the funniest reason for the girls not coming to India is being told that Michelle did not want her daughters after the return from Delhi like the children of Delhi on the streets of America 'who knows who my father is? ' Screaming 2
 Reasons for not going to Agra: Before his arrival, Obama shortened his tour to India, due to which his visit to Agra was canceled
 ye sunne ke baad kaiyon ke dil tut gaye or wo yun pratikriyaayein dene lage maano obama ne taj dekhne se nahin unke bhattije ke mundan main shaamil karne se manaa kar diya ho
 3
 'ghar vaapasi' ke dar se nahin gaeobama kaa agra daura radd hone ke baad kuch ye kehete paae gaye ki baraak ‘hossain’ obama agra main hue haalia ‘ghar vaapasi’ ke chalate dar gaye hai
 4
 ajam khan kaa bhi dar thavhin kuch ye kah rahe the ki unhen dar tha kahin tajmahal ke saath-saath ajam khan unhen bhi vakf board kii sampatti na ghoshit kar den
 5
 toll tex mahangaa hona bhi thi vajahabaraaq obama ke agra na jane kii jo sabase vaazib vajah bataai gai wo ye thi ki obama dilli se agra ke bich padane vaale toll tex kaa kharch sun sakate main aa gaye the
 6
 obama ne modi se kaan main kya puchhaobama bharat aae or utarate hi namaste kiya
 Here also those who spread rumors did not spare him
 unki maane to namaste ke baad obama ne modi ji se sidhe ‘babuji (alokanath’) kahaan hai?’ poocha or uske baad hotel jane kii bajaay ‘suryavansham’ vaale hira thakur ke ghar jane kii jid karne lage
 7
 palika bazaar kaa rasta puch raheen thim mishelabataya ja rahaa he ki airport par modi se aupchaarik abhivadan ke baad baraak obama kii patni mishael obama pradhanmantri narendra modi se palika bazaar kaa rasta puch rahi thim
 8
 chaay pe charchaa main modi ne kya kahaobama kii bharat yatra kii vajah antarrashtriya muddon par china kaa badhata dakhal bhi bataaya ja rahaa he
 Modi also ended up drinking tea while worrying about Obama
 unhone chaay ke pyaale main sugar kyub daal chammach se hilaate hue obama ko ishaara kiya ki ‘chiniyon’ ko ham yun gaayab kar sakate hai
 9
 'sasuraal simer kaa' dekhnaa chaahati thim mishelbaraa obama kii bharat yatra ke uddeshy bhi talaashe ja rahe hai or nihitarth bhi bataae ja rahe afvaahon ke bazaar main jaisi sugabugahat he
 Accordingly, Obama has come to India at the behest of Michelle because she wanted to come here and see 'sasural Simar Ka'
 10
 If Obama was to take 'jeevan Saral Policy', Barack Obama also expressed his desire to take 'jeevan Saral Policy' while visiting India
 11
 Obama has seen a flat in Noida, as a builder, Obama has seen a flat in Noida after visiting India in which he has decided to stay after retirement
 builder ke mutabik obama ne usase ek flats kii keemat or iemai kii kisht pataa kiya he
 12
 nirmal baba ke samagam main shaamil hone aae obamanirmal baba ke ek shishy bataate hai vastav main wo parade kii aad main nirmal babaaji ke samagam main hissaa lene aae hai
 At the same time, Nirmal wants blessings from Baba to diagnose his and America's problems
 13
 The extent of the obamafwahs who came to see the MSG became so when someone heard that Obama had come to see Gurmeet Ram Rahim's MSG and till his return, Barack Hussein Obama will keep his name
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Agra people are the happiest on their way to visit Obama in India
 ek to taj chamak uthaa shahar saaf ho gaya or duusare obama ke na aane ke chalate dillivaasiyon kii tarah bandishen bhi nahi jhelni padin
 One more thing has come out of this, that no cleanliness campaign is needed to clean the whole country, only Obama is invited to visit different cities every month

 ' Chief of Army Staff General VK Singhaneyayu seems to have won the first round of legal battle over the deadlock because the Supreme Court on Friday said that the manner in which his statutory complaint has been dismissed appears to be 'malicious'
 ’ court ne is maamle kii agali sunwaayi 10 farvari ko tay karte hue yah jaananaa chaha ki kya sarkaar 30 disambar 2011 ke apane aadesh kaa waapas lenaa chaahegi
 On December 30, Defense Minister AK Antony issued an order dismissing Gen Singh's statutory complaint stating that his date of birth should not be considered 10 May 1950 but 10 May 1951 in the Army records
 nyaayamurti aar em lodha or nyaayamurti ech el gokhale kii peeth ne sarkaar par prashn uthaaye
 The bench was of the opinion that the order dated 21 July 2011 of the Ministry of Defense was based on the opinion of the Attorney General which considered the date of birth as 10 May 1950
 iske saath hi vah maamla bhi unke (atarni general kii) raay par aadhaarit tha jab 30 disambar ko vaidhanik shikaayat par aadesh paarit kiya gaya tha
 When the court asked if the government would like to withdraw its order of 30 December, Attorney General GE Vahanvati said that he would get the government's instructions on the issue
 court ne kaha ki yadi sarkaar 30 disambar ke apane aadesh ko waapas le leti he to general singh ke samaksh anya upaay uplabdh hai
 The court said that in that case, General Singh's statutory complaint against the order of July 21 can be reconsidered by the authorities and in addition he has the option to go to the Armed Forces Tribunal
 sunwaayi ke dauraan peeth ne kaha ki jab yah kaha gaya ki general singh kii shikaayat vichaar yogya nahin he tab unke paas supreme court main aane ke alaava koi vikalp nahin bachaa tha
 From the beginning, the bench questioned the decision-making process of the government
 peeth ne kaha ki hamen jitani chintaa nirnay ko lekar nahin he utani nirnay lene kii prakriya ko lekar he jo ki durbhaavna se grast he kyonki 21 july kaa aadesh atorni general kii ore se di gai raay par vichaar karke diya gaya
 When the statutory complaint made by the Chief of Army Staff was decided on 30 December, the opinion of the Attorney General was also discussed
 peeth ne aage kaha ki ricard kii saamagree naiysargik nyaay or kanoon ke siddhant par khari nahin utarati
 Attorney General and Solicitor General Rohinton Nariman defended the government's move and said there was no prejudice against General Singh on the facts
 court ke aadesh par general singh ke ek vakil punit bali ne kaha ki ve is aadesh se nishchit rup se prasann hai lekin ve maamle ke gundosh main nahin jaaenge kyonki maamla abhi vichaaradhin he
 He said that the main question raised by the court was that the authority which rejected General Singh's statutory complaint based its decision on the advice of the Attorney General who had earlier advised the government to in its order dated July 21 Take the final decision
 bali ne media se iske bahut adhik arth nahin nikaalane ke liye kehete hue kaha ki adaalat ke liye prashn khadaa karnaa saamaanya prakriya he

 a shameful face of the police was seen in Ghaziabad city of UP adjacent to Delhi
 jahaan chaaku ke waar se ghayal ek lahooluhaan baccha jab apni maa ke saath shikaayat karne thane pahunchaa, to vahaan baithe pulicekarmiyon ne unhen najrandaaj kar diya
 For about an hour and a half, the mother and son kept pleading for justice in the police station but the police did not budge
 baad main kisi ke video banane par pulisavaalon ne maa-bete ko aspataal jane ke liye kahkar apni jimmedaari puri kar lee
 The incident is from the Vijayanagar police station area

 Just then a young man living in his neighborhood came and started asking him for mobile
 bachche ne jab use mobile dene ke liye manaa kar diya to aaropee yuvak gusse se bhar gaya or usne chaaku se bachche ke chehre or gardan par hamalaa kar diya
 The attack resulted in bleeding from the child's face and neck
 vah kisi tarah se apane ghar pahunchaa or apni maa ko aapbeetee sunai
 Hearing this, the mother of the victim took him to Vijayanagar police station
 peedit or uski maa ne pulisavaalon se nyaay kii guhaar lagaai
 But far from listening to them, the policemen did not speak to the blood-soaked child for first aid

 When a man saw the matter, he started making videos there

 bhartiya janata party (BJP) ke netritv vaale endie se sahyogi dal naata todakar alag ho rahe hai
 In this episode, Shiv Sena has already announced to fight alone in the Lok Sabha elections
 itnaa hi nahin shivasena uttar pradesh main bijepi ke sahyogi ke saath milakar chunavi samar main utarane kii ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he
 According to sources, Shiv Sena is increasing contacts with allies of BJP
 sutron kii maane to shivasena netaa sanjay raut uttar pradesh main bijepi ke sahyogi or yogi sarkaar main mantri om prakaash rajbhar se mulaakaat bhi kar chuke hai
 Conversations have also been held several times between the two leaders
 mana ja rahaa he ki shivasena upi main jaldi hi gathbandhan kaa elaan kar sakati he
 If Om Prakash Rajbhar's talk with the Bharatiya Janata Party is not made, then his Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party and Shiv Sena can join hands
 jis tarah se om prakaash rajbhar kaaphi dinon se bagawati rukh akhriyaar kiye hue hai or unhone bijepi adhyaksh ko 100 din kaa ultimatum de rakhaa he
 These speculations are being strengthened by this
 haal hi ke dinon main omprakash rajbhar ne bijepi or yogi sarkaar kii aalochana karte samay bispi supremeo mayawati kii tarif kii thi, us vakt yah mana ja rahaa tha ki rajbhar jald hi sapa-basapa gathbandhan main shaamil ho sakate hai
 But in the meantime, the closeness with Rajbhar's Shiv Sena is increasing, after which it is believed that he can join hands with Shiv Sena
 haalanki, bijepi unhen khaas tavajjo nahin de rahi he
 At the same time, Shiv Sena is also getting active in expanding its organization in UP
 pichley dinon ram mandir nirmaan ko lekar shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ayodhya pahunche the
 Shiv Senashiv Sena wants to contest 25 seats, this time it wants to field candidates in 25 Lok Sabha seats of UP
 sanjay raut jald hi upi main gathbandhan kaa elaan bhi kar sakate hai
 At the same time, Om Prakash Rajbhar has also announced to field candidates in the Lok Sabha elections
 is tarah se donon dal milakar chunaav maidan main utarate hai to bijepi kaa sameekaran bighad saktaa he
 a Shiv Sena MLA in Uttar Pradesh during the Ram Mandir movement in the 90s
 haalanki iske baad kai baar shivasena ne kismat aajamaai, lekin safalataa nahin mili
 In such a situation, this move of Shiv Sena by bringing BJP ally with you is also being seen as an exercise to expand its base in UP
 bataa den ki shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare bijepi ke sheersh netritv or centre sarkaar ke khilaaf morcha khole hue hai
 In the editorial of Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamna, Narendra Modi is also continuously raising questions against the policies of the government
 vah ram mandir se lekar notebandi jaise muddon par modi sarkaar kii aalochana kar chuke hai
 In such a situation, it is believed that Shiv Sena can make its way in the Lok Sabha elections separately from BJP
