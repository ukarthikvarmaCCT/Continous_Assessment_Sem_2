 Mayank Gandhi, a member of the national executive of the Aam Aadmi Party and convenor of Maharashtra, has pointed fingers at Arvind Kejriwal by writing a block
 mayank gandhi ne likhaa he ki saare fasaada kii jad arvind kejariwal hi hai
 Mayank Gandhi has written that Kejriwal had clearly stated that if Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan stay in the PAC, then they will not be able to work
 mayank gandhi ne likhaa he ki wo jaanate hai ki is khulaase se unhen bhi iske nattejey bhugatne pad sakate hai, lekin vah iske liye taiyaar hai
 Mayank Gandhi quoted Yogendra and Prashant as saying that Kejriwal does not want to put him in the party's political affairs committee (PAC)
 rashtriya kaaryakarini kii buudhvaar ko hui baithak main 19 sadasyon ne bhaag liya tha, jinamein mayank gandhi bhi shaamil the
 Gandhi said that although both leaders were ready to move out of the PAC, they had also made two proposals
 yadav or bhushan ne suzav diya ki nau sadasyeey piesi kaa dobaaraa gathan kiya jaae, jisamen sadasyon ko matdaan ke madhyam se chunaa jaae, magar chunaav kii is prakriya main ve donon bhaag nahin lenge
 Secondly, he suggested that the PAC could continue to function in this way, but Yadav and Bhushan would not attend its meetings
 unhone kaha, "baithak kuch samay ke liye sthagit ho gai or manish sisodiya or anya ko ashish khetaan, ashutosh, dilip pandeya aadi ne faisla lene ke liye adhikrut kar diya
 " mayank gandhi ne buudhvaar kii raat apane blog main likhaa, "dobaaraa se baithak hone par manish sisodiya ne ek prastaav rakhaa ki yogendra or prashanth ko piesi se baahar nikaal diya jaae
 Sanjay Singh agreed to this proposal
 " Delhi's Deputy Chief Ministers Manish Sisodia, Ashish Khaitan, Ashutosh, Pandey and Sanjay Singh Kejriwal are considered supporters
 baithak se pehle unamem se kuch ne bhushan or yadav ke khilaaf kai chubhane vaale aarope lagaae
 He accused Yogendra of rebelling against Kejriwal
 gandhi ne kaha ki rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main matdaan kii prakriya main kuch anya sadasyon ke saath unhone bhi hissaa nahin liya tha
 He, however, agreed that Yadav and Bhushan should be excluded from the PAC and given some other responsibilities, as Kejriwal needs a comfortable environment to function as a PAC
 gandhi ne kaha, "main prastaav laakar unhen saarvajanik rup se hataane kii baat par dang tha, khaastaur par tab jab ve swayan piesi chhodane ke liye taiyaar the
 Apart from this, the decision to sack them was against the sentiments of AAP workers across the country
 " He said that although Yadav and Prashant should resign from the PAC, the manner and intention behind the proposal is not acceptable and that is why they kept themselves away from voting

 aktubar, 1998 kii ek subah kii baat he
 At that time Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee called Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha to discuss a big idea before giving a speech at FICCI
 vaajapeyi desh ke do main se ek sabase bade udyog sanghathan main aisa najariya pesh karnaa chaahate the, jo bade kaarobaari pramukhon ko turant aakarshith kar le
 At the same time, he first introduced the idea of laying a network of highways across the country
 24 aktubar, 1998 ko fikki kii sabha main unhone elaan kiya ki sarkaar isi saal main deshbhar main 20 alag-alag jagahon se 7,000 kimi lambii sadak bichaane kaa kaam shuru kar degi
 At that time, the Vajpayee government's proposal to connect the entire country with highways and roads seemed far-fetched
 sinha ne bataaya ki ‘‘logon ne vaajapeyi kaa majaak udaaya or sawaal karne lage ki paisa kahaan se aayega? jameen ke adhigrahan jaisi kai chunautiyaan bhi thim
 '' Currently Rs 54,000 crore
 kii jo sadak pariyojna chal rahi he, uske liye shuru main paisa petrol or dijal par ek rupaya atirikt kar lagaakar jutaya gaya
 Fifteen years later, when the Prime Ministerial candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Narendra Modi, shared many ideas, including connecting the rivers of India, the response of the people was almost the same
 bharat ke liye unki sankalpana main nadiyon ko jodgaye, bullate train chalaane, railway tantra ko aadhunik karne, gas grid or optical fibre network banane tathaa 100 smart shaharon kaa nirmaan karne jaisi yojanaayen shaamil hai
 20 lakh crore on these
 kharch honge
 The idea of connecting rivers came in the Vajpayee era in 2002, in addition to 14 rivers in North India originating from the Himalayas and 16 rivers of the peninsula in South India

 There are about 125 smart city projects currently underway in Gujarat
 ye smart cities ity ke saath-saath sadakon or rajmargon se bhi judi hai
 But critics believe that Modi's intentions are far from the ground reality of India and these intentions do not seem to be his own either
 masalan, bullate train chalaanaa behad mahangaa he or is par varshon se vichaar chal rahaa he
 There is already a plan to expand India's optical fiber network to broadband to two lakh gram panchayats

 The reason for this is that due to small holdings in India, it is not considered practical to keep track of the yield through satellite across the country
 lekin visheshgyon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki infrastracchar arase baad raajnneeti ke mukhya agenda main jagah paa rahaa he
 Vinayak Chatterjee is happy that talk of connecting rivers is happening

 Rajeev Kumar, senior economist at the Center for Policy Research, admits that it sounds good to hear, but until the whole blueprint is revealed, all these things seem to be rhetorical

 Film Name: Bombay Velvet Director: Anurag Kashyapstar Cast: Ranbir Kapoor, Anushka Sharma, Karan Johar, KK Menon, Vivaan Shah, Manish Choudhary, Siddharth Basu: 15 minutes Thinking is starting to flourish on its own, whether it is Black Friday, Gulal, Gangs of Wasseypur or Ugly, and this time too Anurag has tried to do something different, historian Rtran Inspired by the light of the book "mumbai Fables" He handwriting Sirf'bombe Velvet 'for the last eight years and exposed the last audience was his masterpiece
 jab ham koi nayaa prayog karte hai to sirf do baaten hoti hai yaa to wo safal hota he yaa niraashaa haath lagati he 
 Let's know how Anurag's effort is
 kahani :-balraj (ranbir kapur)bharat - paak vibhaajanke dauraan 1949 main apni mon ke saath bambai (ab munmbai kehalaata he) aata he or vahaan kuch paristhiyon ke kaaran garibi jhelte hue amir banane kaa khwab dekhne lagata he or usee sapane ko sach karne ke liye bijnesaman kaijad khambata (karan johar) ke 'bombai velvet' club main manager ke taur par kaam karne lagata he or usee club main jaij singer ke taur par kaam karne vaali roji (anoushka sharma) ko dil de baithta he
 Along with Ishq, the business also goes on, then the twist and different plotlines unfold and a slightly different climax comes from the typical Anurag Kashyap's films
 abhinay evam sangeet :-abhinay ke lihaaj se ranbir kapur ne apane kirdaar main jaan phoonk di he , jis tarah se us daur kaa lahaza ,chaal chalan, haav bhav ko ranbir ne pakadaa he wo kaabil e tarif he 
 At the same time, Anushka Sharma, who became a jazz singer in the role of Rosie, is admirable but Karan Johar has some scenes that bring a smile to your face
 abhinayta ke ke menon kaa kirdaar or bhi bada or behatar kiya ja saktaa tha , is film main unhen puri tarah se cash nahin kar paye hai anuraag 
 Vivaan Shah also shares a few frames and another character in this film is Chimman, the friend of Rubber, played by Manish Chaudhary, he looks a bit admirable at times
 vahin agar geet sangeet kii baat karen to 60 ke dashak ke gaano kii chhap is film main milti he or mere hisaab se 1-2 gane kam hone chahie the
 The way Amit Trivedi used the instruments of the 60s during Gano is also very commendable
 kyon dekhen-dekhiye is film ko dekhne kii aapaki apni vajahen ho sakati hai, masalan aap ranbir , anoushka, yaa karan johar ke diwane hai, or yadi aap anuraag kashyap or unki film ke diwane hai to ye film shaayad aapane maanako par khari naa utre or niraashaa saath aaye
 Why not see - while watching the film, many times it is thought that when the film will end, and it is revealed that the interval has not yet happened, Anurag Kashyap has set up the city of bullets, gunfire, 60s and Everyone has paid attention to a little bit, but this time he seems unable to entertain people with his work, the thought was quite good that the time before Bombay got the record of metropolis and people Ase were but this time filming was significantly longer loose
 kahani kehane kaa dhangkophi niraashajanak he or 151 minute ke saath saath paisa bhi vasuul nahin ho paata he
 i myself agree with many of Anurag's films, but the star of this film's comparison remains very low, although Ranbir has played one of his highest roles in this film, but he will also have to bear the brunt of the script of this film
 is film ko main 2 star detaa hoon
 1 star for Ranbir Kapoor's best and best performance and 1 star Anurag Kashyap for 8 years of preparation, because it takes a lot of hard work to make a film even if it is directionless

 As Sadhvi Pragya Thakur enters the electoral battle, the election battle in Bhopal seat of Madhya Pradesh has become interesting
 2019 ke chunavi yuddh kaa ye sabase dilachasp maidan ban chukaa he
 Here on the one side is Digvijay Singh from Congress, who has been accused of forging the theory of Hindu terrorism, on the other hand, it will be Sadhvi Pragya Thakur from BJP who was made a symbol of Hindu terrorism theory
 sadhvi pragna thakur ke bahaane bijepi ne aakraamak hindutv card khelaa he
 For the Congress, speaking anything on it is like walking on the edge of the sword
 bhagava aatankwaad ko upie raaj main di gai thi havaasmay ke saath ab kaaphi kuch badal chukaa he
 After 9 years in jail, the way Sadhvi is now making a comeback, all the cases of Hindu terror are piling up in the court
 phir chahen wo maalegaanv blast cese ho yaa phir samjhauta express blast cese
 a big decision came on the agreement on March 20 itself
 isamen swami aseemanand sahit chaar aropiyon ko sabooton ke abhaav main court ne bari kar diya tha
 The BJP had indicated at the same time that it would make the punctured theory of Hindu terrorism an election issue, because this theory was given a lot of air during the UPA rule
 bijepi ko ab iske bahaane congress ko nae sire se gherne kaa mauka mila he, jis ranneeti main ab wo aakraamak tareeke se chal rahi he
 Giving tickets to Sadhvi Pragya Thakur from Bhopal is a direct sign of this
 koun hai sadhvi pragna thakurmadhya pradesh ke bhind kii rahane vaali sadhvi pragna history main post graduate hai
 Pragya was initially associated with the Sangh's organization Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad
 iske alaava wo vishwa hindu parishad kii mahila morcha durga vahini se bhi judi thim
 48-year-old Sadhvi Pragya Thakur is an accused in the 2008 Malegaon Blast Case
 is cese main unhen 9 saal jail main rahane ke baad pichley saal bombai hoicourt se jamaanat mili thi
 In 2017, a stringent law against him was lifted by the NIA court
 2018 main NIA ne unhen clin chit de di thi, lekin ise court ne nahin mana
 Trial is still going on against him in the special court of NIA
 hindu aatankwaad kaa mudda piem modi ne lapkabhagava aatank par piem narendra modi bhi bol chuke hai
 In his rallies, he has clearly said that Congress has done the job of staining Hindu terrorism on crores of people of this country
 raily main unhone apane parichit andaaj main logon se poocha tha ki aap mujhe bataaie hindu aatankwaad shabd sun aapako gahari chot pahunchi thi ki nahin?congress ke teen netaa, nishane par digvijaypiem ne 15 din pehle hi us hindu aatank kii theory ko chunavi mudda bana diya tha, jis hindu aatank kii theory par upie ke jamaane main bahut charchaa hui thi
 With this theory, three big Congress leaders p Chidambaram, Digvijay Singh and Sushil Shinde were playing on the front foot
 sanghee, bhagava or hindu aatankwaad
 a large political battle has already taken place between the Congress and the BJP over the use of such words
 isamen sabase zyaada bijepi ke nishane par digvijay singh rahe, jinke khilaaf chunavi maidan main bijepi ne sadhvi pragna thakur ko utaara he
 Such Sadhvi is not saying 'dharmyuddha', it is called time which can change anytime
 ye sochaa nahin gaya tha ki aisa mauka bhi aayega ki digvijay singh ke khilaaf bijepi us chehre ko chunaav main utaar degi jisaki vajah se hi hindu aatank kii theory charchaa main ai thi
 This is bjp's new electoral strategy
 sadhvi pragna ise dharmayuddh aise hi nahin kah rahi hai
 By putting Pragya Thakur in front of Digvijay Singh, BJP has put a sharp edge in the electoral weapon of Hindutva
 iskaa mauka bijepi ko tab se mila he jab 20 march ko samjhauta blast cese main enie court ne swami aseemanand sahit chaar aropiyon ko bari kar diya tha
 In fact, in bringing Sadhvi to the polls, the Sangh and BJP saw a big opportunity to take the Hindu terror theory to the people's court, because the UPA government was constantly accused that the Hindu terror theory was forcibly raised
 30 saal se bijepi kaa abhedya durg bhopal1989 se yani pichley tees saal main bhopal loksabhaa seat har baar bijepi ne jiti he
 Last time, BJP won this seat with a margin of 3 lakh 70 thousand votes
 lekin 2018 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhopal kii 8 main se 3 siten congress ne jiti thim
 bjp's vote share in five seats was very low, which increased the bjp's concern
 is baar congress ne digvijay singh ko utarkar bijepi kii mushkilen badha di or ranneeti badalane par majaboor kar diya, kyonki bhopal ke 18 lakh voter main kareeb saadhe chaar lakh voter muslim hai
 Even after 10 years, the same political situation like Hindu terrorism has not been made an election issue for the first time
 2009 ke chunaav main bhi sadhvi pragna chunavi centre main thim
 At that time too, the BJP played the card of Hindutva
 tatkaaleen pradhanmantri dow
 In contrast to Manmohan Singh, BJP had raised the slogan of 'forced prime minister or strong prime minister', keeping the face of LK Advani
 party kaa na sirf ye daanv fail sabit hua, balki adwani kaa raajnneetik kariyar bhi takreeban tabhi khatm ho gaya
 Now 10 years later in 2019, Sadhvi Pragya is in the political headlines
 narendra modi ke rup main majboot pradhanmantri kaa cheharaa aage rakhte hue bijepi phir se hindutv ke card ke saath maidan main he
 It will be interesting to see if this cracker got trapped 10 years ago, this time it will be able to bring some earthquake
 karnataka ke mukhyamantribi esayediurppakobijepi haikamanane dilli bulaayaa he
 The reason is the allegations of a new scam against Yeddyurappa
 ji haa, vipaksh ne aarope lagaaya he ki mukhyamantri ve es yediurppa ke bete ko kai companiyon ne chanda diya or soobe kii sarkaar ne un companiyon kaa kaam kiya
 It is expected that Yeddyurappa will meet BJP President Nitin Gadkari in Delhi
 iske alava ummid he ki vah party ke karnataka maamalon ke prabharee arun jetali sahit party ke anya varisht netaaon se bhi mulaakaat karenge
 Senior JDS leader HD Kumaraswamy released some documents at a press conference held in Delhi under his latest allegation claiming that a teaching trust run by Yeddyurappa has received a grant of Rs 27 crore from various companies for the official favor
 anudaan dene vaali companiyon main ve companiyaan bhi shaamil he jo ghate main chal rahi hai
 Karnataka Chief Minister VS Yeddyurappa appears to be mired in a new scam
 vipaksh kaa aarope he ki yediurppa ke bete bi vaai yediurppa ke prerana trust ne steel or construction companiyon se chanda liya
 In return, the Yeddyurappa government benefited these companies
 sutron ke mutabik 2008 se 2010 ke bich prerana trust ko 27 karod 18 lakh rupye die gaye
 The names of Adarsh developers, Industrial Techno Manpower Services Private Limited, Jai Bharti Technical Private Limited, Real Technical Solutions Private Limited and South West Mining Limited are among the companies that have given donations to Yeddyurappa's son's trust
 in aaropon par mukhyamantri ve es yediurppa ne jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya
 That is, Yeddyurappa is neither denying the charges nor refusing
 koshish kuch aisi he aaropon ko tool naa diya jaae
 Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said that 9 percent growth rate can be achieved in the country through public-private partnership
 mukherjee ne shanivaar raat ek puraskaar samaaroh main kaha, si koi vajah nahin he ki ham nau pratishat vruddhi dar hasil nahin kar sakate

 The biggest challenge of leadership is to overcome 'dharma Sankat': Attitude of Pillai 'leader should be like father , not pleasurable nor profitable' Management Guru in 'corporate Chanakya' session of 7th edition of India Today Group's annual Business Event Minder Dr
 Radhakrishnan Pillai said that the Chanakya policy says that a leader should have a 100-year plan, not one or two years
 leader kii kamyaabi uski ranneeti par nirbhar karti he
 The biggest challenge of his leadership comes when he faces a 'religion crisis' and has to choose one of the 'do's and don'ts'
 doctor radhakrishnan pillai ne kaha ki jab aap ek leader hote ho to aap har cheez ke liye jimmedaar hote ho
 Leaders must also understand human psychology
 main chanakya ko ek manovaigyanik ke rup main dekhtaa hum jisane maanav vyavhaar par gaur kiya
 Pillai, who has written a book titled Chanakyanityi on the first 90 days of critical change for the leader, says that if you are promoted in an institution or are involved in another institution, then the initial 90 days are very important
 lekin leaders ke saath samasya yahi hoti he ki wo pehle hi din ve ection lene ke prati utsaahi ho jate hai
 He said that Chanakya says that the biggest problem facing the leaders is when the 'dharma Sankat' comes before them 'what to do or what not to do'
 mind rash ke 7wein sanskaran main pillai ne kaha ki chanakya niti kahati he ki leader ko bujurgon ke saath lagaataar baat karte rahanaa chahie jisase use pichhali ghatnaon or unke anubhavon kii jaankaree mil sake
 One has to be in constant contact with him
 iske alaava atitud bhi kaaphi ahm hota he, leader kaa atitud ek pita kii tarah hona chahie, na sukhakaari na hitkari
 The energy of the team depends on the energy of the leader
 He said that the energy of the team depends only on the energy of the leader
 duniya main zyaadaatar leader shant rahete hai or shantipurvak tareeke se kaam karte hai
 Leaders encourage people in different ways
 dhoni kehete hai ki bada nahin sochate alag sochate hai
 Chanakya says that if the strategy does not work then it is a problem of leadership
 ek leader main yah kshamta honi chahie ki vah sabko aashwast kare ki sab kuch sthir he or kahin koi dikkat nahin he
 The leader himself kept the charge and kept the others motive
 ek leader kaa kere soch or use karwaanaa hota he
 Chanakya says that the leader should have a 100-year plan
 yah sab kuch uski saxes planning par nibhar karata he
 Constant study is the biggest weapon for success because all knowledge is internal
 pillai ne kaha ki chanakya kaa arthshaastra behad saadhaaran he or vyavhaarik kitaab he jisamen sam, daam, dand bhed kii baat kahi gai he
 Chanakya speaks of discipline
 aisa nahin he ki arthshaastra chanakya ke samay aayaa
 Chanakya himself admitted that 14 people before him knew economics, he was not the first guru who knew about this scripture
 sahi log ko sahi kaam mileh chanakya nitidoctor radhakrishnan pillai ne kaha ki arthshaastra leadership par baat karata he
 The biggest challenge of a leader is that the right people get the right job
 unhone kaha ki chanakya raja nahin tha, lekin uske paas ranneeti thi
 His strategy worked
 ek leader kii training saptang par di jaati he
 There are seven organs in the weekend
 arthshaastra ke 7 hajaar sutara main yah sutara leadership kii baat karata he
 In Saptang, Swami, Amatya, Janpad, Durg, Kosh, Dand and Friends come and everyone has their own importance
 chanakya kaa arthshaastra videsh niti par bhi baat karata he
 He said that this principle of Chanakya is Total Management
 isamen har cheez kii baat kahi gai he
 Pillai said that Chanakya's policy says that the leader should never fight alone
 logon ke saath milakar ranneeti banaakar ladaai kerani chahie
 The battle of Ramayana and Mahabharata is also a great example of this
 is ladaai main sena kii sankhya ahm nahin rahi kyonki ranneeti kaam ai
 If Chanakya is with Chandragupta, then Krishna with Arjuna
 kamyaabi ke liye ranneeti ahm hoti he

 jyotish shaastra ke anusaar 9 grah hamaare jivan main sukh or dukh kaa kaaran banate hai
 If the position of these planets is good in the native's horoscope, then his positive effect is also seen in his life
 lekin kundali main agar grah jataka ke vipareet he to uskaa prabhaav bhi uske jivan par pratikul hi padataa he
 Venus is one of these 9 planets
 agar kundali main shukr grah kii sthiti acchhee naa ho to jataka kaa angootha bina kisi vajah se kharaab ho jaataa he yaa uskaa swaroop bigadane lagata he
 The person may have to face many problems in the married life along with skin disease
 aise main jaanate hai aaj koun se upaay karne se shukr grah ko shant karke jivan main aane vaali kai pareshaaniyon ko dur kiya ja saktaa hai
 These problems occur when Venus is weak - there is lack of happiness in a person's life when Venus is weak
 - vyakti sari suvidhaayen rahane par bhi uskaa sukh nahin bhoga paata he
 - a person's money keeps wasting unnecessary space
 - saath hi prem or bhaawanaaon ke maamle main vyakti ko takalif milti he
 - Attraction in a person's personality keeps decreasing
 shukr ke kharaab hone par dikhaai dene lagate hai ye lakshan-- shukr ke kharaab hone par vyakti aasakt hota he
 - His enjoyment is strong
 - aise logon kaa charitra kamjor hone kii sambhaavna bani rahati he
 - Problems often arise in marital life
 - vriddhavastha main aise log samasyaon ke shikaar ho jate hai
 Take these precautions when Venus is spoiled - if Saturn works dim then Venus leaves with you
 -patni kaa sammaan karen or paraai stri se dur rahen
 - Keep yourself and the house clean and always wear clean clothes
 -sharir ko saaf rakhen 
 Use scented perfumes or cents
 shukr kamjor ho to karen ye upaay-- purush hai to opel dhaaran karnaa laabhakaari hoga
 - If you are a woman, wearing a diamond or zircon will be beneficial
 - safed sphatik kii maala pahananaa bhi laabhakaari hoga
 - Offer white flowers to Shiva on regular Friday
 - gulabi or safed vastron kaa prayog laabh degaa
 - Using light fragrance will also be beneficial
 shukr ke ye upaay bhi hai kargar-- shukr se sambandhit koi bhi ratna bhuulakar bhi dhaaran na karen
 - Wake up early in the morning and chant the mantras of Venus
 - shukr ke mantra- " draan drin dron sah shukray namah" kaa jap karen
 - Donate white sweets on Friday
 - pile rang kaa adhik se adhik prayog karen

 Petroleum Minister m Veerappa Moily said today that the government will not withdraw the gas price hike decision
 desh main gas utpaadak companiyon ko 1 april, se 2014 se badhaane kii anumati di gai he, jo maujuuda mulya kaa doguna ho jayega
 Moily sharply criticized Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, calling the FIR lodged by the anti-corruption Bureau of the Delhi government against him and others for raising the gas price
 mukhyamantri ne is sambandh main kuch sevanivrutt adhikariyon kii shikaayat par yah praathmiki daayar karne kaa nirdesh diya tha
 Moily told reporters during an event here, where is the question of banning it (the decision to increase the price)

 This has been considered twice by the Cabinet and has been approved again

 Earlier this week, Kejriwal ordered a police complaint to be lodged against Moily, Reliance Industries and its chairman Mukesh Ambani to create artificial gas shortages in the country and raise prices
 moili ne kaha, mujhe nahin lagata ki dilli sarkaar hamaara apiliy nyaayaadhikaran he
 Whatever they are doing is completely unconstitutional and certainly against the principles of the federal structure
 unhone kaha ki exiaar ‘ek bahut spasht maamla he ki ve samvidhan se pare apane adhikaron kaa istemaal kar rahe hai or balki main to yah kahuunga ki yah sanvidhik praavdhaanon ke ulat he
 Moily said that public companies like ONGC and RIL were allowed to recover prices in international gas markets at par with the current and average prices of the cost of fuel imports in the last 12 months, based on recommendations of the Rangarajan Committee
 unhone kaha, vah (rangarajan) ek prakhyat arthshaastri hai or maine unki siforeeshon main ek bhi shabd, purna viraam
 Nothing has changed, so where is Moily's decision on the gas price increase
 moili ne kaha, rangarajan samiti kaa gathan jaipal reddy dwaara kiya gaya tha jo us samay petroleum mantri the
 i have not constituted the committee according to my needs
 yah puche jane par ki kya vah exiaar ke khilaaf ucch adaalat main jaaenge to moili ne kaha ki is par nirnay mantrimandal or pradhanmantri ko karnaa he, kyonki gas kaa mulya badhaane kaa nirnay unka vyaktigat nirnay nahin tha
 He said, it was approved by the Cabinet twice (first in June 2013 and then in December)
 isse pehle sanyukt raashtra ke global kampact network kii bhartiya shakha dwaara yojit ek sammelan main moili ne kaha ki jab tak pratispardhi mulya nahin die jate, desh ke liye urja suraksha hasil nahin kii ja sakati

 Giving higher prices will help increase production and curb imports, which cost 14 to 18 dollars per 1 million British thermal units

 maamla gajiabad ke indirapuram thana kshetra kaa he31 agast ko mahila ne bachche ke apharan kii shikaayat likhavai thigaziabad main hairaan karne vaala maamla saamne aayaa he
 Here a mother falsely plotted to kidnap her 5-month-old child
 ghatana kaa khulaasa karte hue gajiabad police ne 5 maah ke bachche ko sakushal baraamad kar liya he
 The case is related to Indirapuram police station area of ghaziabad
 ghatana kaa khulaasa sharmasaar karne vaala he
 The mother had created a false story of the kidnapping of her 5-month-old son due to his illegitimate relationship and left him away from his friend
 gajiabad police ne bachche kii maa or uski saheli, saheli kii saas or bachche kii maa ke premi ko bhi giraftaar kar liya he
 On 31 August, Zainab, who hails from the popular Vihara of Khoda, lodged a report at the police station that her 5-month-old son was abducted from the Saturday market area of indirapuram
 jainab ne police ko bataaya ki vah bazaar main kharidari karne gai thi
 Then the child vomited on her clothes, after which she handed a child to a woman standing nearby and started cleaning her clothes on the nearby tap
 jab kapade saaf kar jainab waapas ai to vah mahila uske bachche ko lekar gaayab ho gai
 The Ghaziabad police immediately came into action and hundreds of cctvs along with the surveillance team were pressed into service in search of the child

 bhartiya janata party ko loksabhaa chunaav main 300 se zyada siten milane kii bhavishyavaanee karne vaale professor rajeshwar shastri musalgamvakar ne modi sarkaar ko lekar ek nai bhavishyavaanee kii he
 In conversation with Aaj Tak, Ujjain professor Rajeshwar Shastri Musalgaonkar said that the Modi government of the Center will set many new records in the next five years
 is dauraan desh main asuraksha kaa dar khatm ho jayega
 Professor Musalgaonkar of Vikram University has claimed that peace will prevail in the country during the tenure of Modi government and this government will prove to be the most reliable government so far
 aapako bataa den ki professor musalgamvakar ne loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan apane fasebuk post main bhartiya janata party ko 300 se zyada siten milane kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi
 The Congress had complained to the District Election Officer and District Education Officer
 jila shiksha adhikari ne ise aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan maanate hue professor musalgamvakar ko nilambit kar diya tha
 However, when the Lok Sabha election results came, Professor Musalgaonkar's prediction proved to be correct and the BJP won a resounding victory
 is chunaav main bhartiya janata party ne 303 loksabhaa siton par jeet darj kii, jabaki congress ko sirf 52 siton par hi jeet mil saki
 Apart from this, DMK got 23 seats and Trinamool Congress got only 22 Lok Sabha seats
 aakhir koun hai professor musalgamvakarprofessor rajeshwar shastri musalgamvakar ujjain ke vikram vishvidhyalay ke jyotish vigyaan vibhaag main professor hai
 The professor's claim may have raised fingers during the Lok Sabha elections, but when the results came, Professor Rajeshwar Shastri Musalgaonkar's prediction came true
 ab bijepi bahumat ke saath jeet chuki he or narendra modi 30 may ko duusari baar pradhanmantri pad kii shapath lene ja rahe hai
 In such a situation, now it will be very interesting to see whether the suspension of the professor comes back or not? dilli jan lokapal bill 2014 ko dilli cabinet ne paas kar diya he
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote on Twitter, 'congratulations! Delhi Jan Lokpal Bill passed by Delhi Cabinet
 'congratulations
 Delhi Jan Lokpal Bill passed by Delhi Cabinet — Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) February 3, 2014 The Jan Lokpal Bill has been approved by the Delhi Government
 cabinet is bill ko sidhe dilli vidhansabha main pesh karegi, ise centre sarkaar ke saamne pesh nahin kiya jayega
 The Jan Lokpal Bill was long awaited
 teen cabinet meeting ke baad ye faisla liya gaya
 The Kejriwal government has already stated that the assembly session will be called from February 13 to 16
 haalanki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja nahin mila hua he aise main centre sarkaar ko bypass karke koi bill dilli vidhansabha main sidhaa pesh karnaa samvidhan ke khilaaf he
 In this regard, the constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap said that in the case of Delhi, the law of the Center is paramount
 agar ek kanoon centre or vidhansabha donon se paas hota he, to centre kaa kanoon hi maanya hota he
 Since the central government has passed the Jan Lokpal bill, Delhi's own Lokpal has no meaning
 haa, vidhansabha lokayukta kanoon main hi sanshodhan kar sakati he
 Kashyap said that according to the constitution, the administration of Delhi is in the hands of the President and under them the Lieutenant Governor is the administrator of Delhi
 iske hisaab se bill ko pehle up rajyapal ke paas janaa chahie
 The Lieutenant Governor usually sends the bill to the President, the Ministry of Home Affairs, from where it is passed in the state after passing
 aam aadmi party ke netaa va dilli ke mantri manish sitaudiya ne kaha, 'aaj kaa din dilli ke liye aitihaasik he
 Under its bill, everyone from Chief Minister to Peon in Delhi will come under its purview
 kisi kaa bhi naam bhrashtachar main aata he to uske khilaaf ek jaisi jaanch hogi
 'the Kejriwal government has drawn a straight line that no one will go beyond the allegations of corruption now and the Chief Minister will be investigated as soon as the SDM is investigated
 aaropon ke aadhaar par adhiktam 6 maheene main jaanch puri ho jaaegi or lokapal court ne doshi paaya to 6 maheene se umr kaid tak kii sajaa
 But this Jan Lokpal Bill 2014 of Kejriwal Government has created a ruckus
 is kanoon se dilli ko bhrashtachar mukt shahar banane main badi madad milegi isse kisi ko koi inkaar nahin lekin samvidhan or paramparaon kii duhai dekar ise atakane kii manshaaen abhi se saaf hone lagi hai
 The Delhi Public Ombudsman Act even states that the affairs of Delhi are outside the purview of the Delhi government, but the people of Delhi who belong to them - like mcds, like Delhi Police like NDMC, will also be able to investigate their officers
 bhale uski report par sunwaayee saamaanya adaalatein karen
 So are the rulers worried about the loss of their privileges
 kyonki dilli jan lokapal paarit ho jane ke baad mantri, mukhyamantri yaa iees, ipies hona beyimaan hone kii surat main dhaal kaa kaam nahin karegaa
 Even the Jan Lokpal itself will not be above complaints
 kya ye apane aapmen ek khatarnaak or avaidh pahal he?ye samaj main nahin aata ki koi bhi apane aapako kanoon yaa sajaa se upar na samajhe, kisi bhi bhrashtachar kii jaanch ho sake or kisi bhi aarope par jaldi sunwaayee or faisla ho jaae isamen kisi ko kya pareshaani honi chahie? ye aap tay kiijie ki kiski chintaaen katghare main hai or kiskaa charitra?

 saath hi congress ne kaha he ki rajya main unki kisi bhi tarah upeksha karnaa raajnneetik rup se 'khatarnaak bhul' hogi
 This statement of the country's major opposition party came when SP President Akhilesh Yadav and BSP chief Mayawati are going to a press conference together on Saturday
 mana ja rahaa he ki donon netaa uttar pradesh main gathbandhan kaa elaan karenge or sambhav he ki donon dal isse congress ko alag rakhen
 When asked about this, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi told reporters, 'let me make it clear that the aim of all like-minded parties is like Congress to remove misrule from this country, remove dictatorship, remove intolerance
 Go yah sabakaa samaan uddeshy he
 We have to work for this purpose
 'unhone sapa or basapa kaa naam liye bagaiyr kaha, 'agar kuch partiyaan is uddeshy main baadha daalati hai to iskaa doshaaropan un par hoga
 i do not think that anyone can ignore the broad potential, heritage, history and identity of the Congress

 " ayodhya main ram janmabhumi cese main donon pakshon kii apilon par daleelon kaa kram 17 aktubar ko khatm ho gaya
 After this, the demand for alternative relief (molding of relief) was also filed one by one by the Hindu and Muslim parties
 molding of relif ek prakriya he jiske tahat pakshakaar apni mul maang na maane jane kii sthiti main uske badale vaikalpik raahat maangate hai
 The Muslim side filed a sealed envelope demanding alternative relief, to which the Hindu side objected
 lekin adaalat ne is maang ko record par le liya he
 Going a step further on the issue of alternative relief, Ramlala has been asked to give the entire land to himself using privileges from the Supreme Court
 kaha gaya he ki hoicourt ke faisle ko darkinar kar nirmohi akhaada yaa muslim paksh ko koi hissaa na diya jaae
 The ASI report proves that there used to be a temple here
 lihaaja puri jameen hi hindu paksh ko de di jaae
 But the demand of the Muslim side is somewhat different from the subject
 ye ek divaani cese he or isamen jameen ke malikana haq ko lekar hindu-muslim paksh court main hai
 The Muslim side has demanded from the Supreme Court that the decision should come in which the constitutional values are reflected
 kyonki ye maamla desh kii bhavi pidiyon ko prabhavit karegi
 In this appeal filed by Sunni Waqf Board, it has been said that the court should give decision in the interest of the country
 supreme court samvidhan kaa rakhwala he or uske faisle main bahusaanskrithik or anek dharmon vaali samskruti kii jhalak milani chahie
 How the future generations will see this decision should also be taken into consideration
 adaalat ke faisle tathyon par hote hai bhaawanaaon par nahin
 The Supreme Court is the keeper of the Constitution
 ye baat court ko yaad dilaane kaa muslim paksh kaa shaayad koi makasad rahaa ho jo ki is cese main spasht to nahin hota he
 The main demand is that of land, but in the Molding of Relief, the Muslim side is making a sentimental appeal which is in itself an abstraction
 ye cese kisi choti-moti adaalat main nahin samvidhan peeth main chal rahaa he or mukhya nyaayadhish samet peeth main paanch jajon ne sava maheene isaki sunwaayee kii he
 While giving the decision to the Constitution Bench, it is a reasonable thing to preach the values of the Constitution, it will be known only when the decision comes
 lekin itnaa to tay he ki muslim paksh ne tathyon ke saath bhavuk apil bhi kar di he
 Court decisions are based on facts and witnesses
 is maamle main sidhe koi gavaah he nahin
 There is historical and mythological evidence in the name of facts
 bhartiya puratathvik surveykshan kii report he jo ki cese main ek ahm subut kahi ja sakati he
 In its judgment, the High Court had divided the disputed land into three parts, against which an appeal was filed in the Supreme Court and the hindu-muslim side has demanded the ownership of the entire land

 He has played well but is not able to perform at his best

 Shane Warne spoke to the spinners after the Chennai Test and told them that his bowling average is 45 here

 The case is related to this innocent's custody
 bachche ke dada daadi kaa aarope he ki use ek tantric ke hawaale kar diya gaya he jo uski bali bhi de saktaa he
 In fact, the lecturer mother and builder father of the child have given him a dodgy to Ramdayal alias Chhoti Sarkar, who lives in Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh
 lekin maasoom ke dada-daadi kaa aarope he ki ramadayal ek tantric he or bachche par jaadu tona karegaa
 They are afraid of sacrificing kimasum
 bachche ke dada ne court kaa darwaja khatkhataya or maang kii ki bachche kii castady unhen de deni chahie
 He said that if the parents of the child do not want to keep him then he should be handed over to his grandparents and not to any tantrik
 is maamle par shuukravaar ko bhi court main sunwaayee hui
 The judge ordered the parents to present the child in the court by 6 pm
 jab baccha court nahin pahunchaa to jaj ne kaha, 'bachche ko le aaiye, ham raat tak intjaar karenge
 'but the parents still showed an inability to spot the child after which the hearing date was set for Saturday as well
 'bachche kii bali dene kaa iraadaa to nahin he?'court ne bachche ke maa-pita se sawaal kiya he ki kahin unka 'bachche kii bali dene kaa iraadaa to nahin he?' isapar unhone jawaab diya ki wo padhe likhe hai or soch samajhakar bachche ko god dene kaa faisla kiya
 He said that Ramdayal has promised to teach and send the child to abroad

 11 disambar ko jab bijepi haar rahi thi tab news channelon main baithe export haar ke kai kaarnon main ek kaaran notebandi ko bhi bataa rahe the lekin usee vakt notebandi kii tarif karne vaale or notebandi ke samay vitt mantralay main sachiv pad se ritair hue shaktikant das ko bhartiya reserve bank kaa governor banaae jane kaa elaan ho rahaa tha
 Shaktikanta Das was the Economic Affairs Secretary during 2015-17 and demonetisation came into force during his tenure
 november se disambar 2016 ke bich kareeb-kareeb har din shaktikant das kii press conference hoti thi or ve notebandi ke lagu kiye jane ko lekar nae-nae niyam banaate the
 Used to give information jab janata note badalane ko lekar samasyaon se ghiri thi tab ve nae-nae idia lekar aate the
 At that time the public was troubled by the long queues outside the banks, there was chaos, but Shaktikanta Das came to the press and told that he has received reports that some people are repeatedly in lines to change black money, so queues Are getting longer
 baqayda unka bayaan he ki bainkon or atm main lambii kataron kaa kaaran yahi tha ki ek hi log alag-alag jagahon par baar-baar ja rahe hai
 Therefore, then he brought the idea that the ink used to be used at the time of elections will be put on the finger of the people who change the notes on the cash counter
 is faisle kii kaaphi aalochana hui thi
 Then the Election Commission wrote to the Finance Ministry that the use of non-dissolving ink should not affect the voting process in five states
 elaan ho gaya magar bainkon ke paas syaahi nahin pahunchi to bank marker kaa istamaal karne lage
 This decision started making fun of him
 shaktikant das ab reserve bank ke governor ban gaye hai
 When asked at the time of demonetisation why the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India is not speaking on demonetisation, Shaktikanta Das said that who is speaking is not important
 main sarkaar kii taraf se bol rahaa hum
 So it does not mean that i am speaking or someone else is speaking
 shaktikant das 1980 batch ke iees afasar hai
 History is subject but has worked in departments related to economic affairs for a long time
 im se bhi management kaa course kiya he
 He has worked in the finance ministry with p Chidambaram, Pranab Mukherjee and Arun Jaitley
 im bengalooru se financial management se course kiya he
 Shaktikanta Das, a BA and MA from history, is being told about how he will handle the work related to monetary policy
 jawaab main unke aarthik maamalon se sambandhit vibhaagon ko pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 He is the first governor in 28 years who is not an economist
 unase pehle es venkitaraman governor bane the
 There is no condition that it will be economist to become Governor of RBI
 purv governor di subbarao ne kaha he ki arthshaastra main bina piechdi vaala bhi governor ho saktaa he
 The governor should be someone whom the market trusts
 amit ranjan mishra ne likhaa he ki das rajan ke jane ke baad bhi daavedaar the
 After his retirement, when there was talk of making the Securities and Exchange Board of Sebi chief, there was an uproar by bjp's Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy
 pradhanmantri ko patr likh diya tha ki ve chidambaram ke kareebi rahe hai or bhrashtachar main lipt rahe hai
 It is said that he was not made the head of SEBI
 subramanyam swami ne aaj bhi bayaan diya he
 However, P
 Chibandaram has also criticized the appointment of Shaktikanta Das as the Governor
 kaha he ki shaktikant das sarkaar ke ishaare par chalenge
 Choosing a bureaucrat who supports demonetization over an economist would hurt the dignity of this institution
 notebandi kaa samarthan karne vaale das duusare vyakti hai jinhen chotii ke pad par baithaaya gaya he
 Perhaps his reference is to make Krishnamurthy Subramanian an economic advisor
 krishnamurthi subramanyam ne bhi notebandi ko phydemand bataaya tha
 Chidambaram has questioned whether the government wants to send a message to the people that what we think, we do not care
 ham vahi karenge jo hamen pasand he
 On the other hand, CII and FICCI have welcomed the appointment of Shaktikanta Das as the Governor in most cases, which has praised every decision of the government
 fikki ke adhyaksh ne kaha he ki shaktikant das vittiya maamalon kii 360 degree samaj rakhte hai
 CIE President Rakesh Bharti Mittal has said that the government has handled the situation by making experienced economic experts as governors and has created a lot of trust in investors and industry
 hamen bharosa he ki bainkon or gaiyr banking vittiya sansthaaon ke paas karz dene ke liye paise kaa pravaah badhegaa
 Das will immediately address this problem
 kya urjit patel bainkon ke liye paise kaa pravaah nahin badha rahe the, kya iskaa yahi matlab hua jo samajha ja rahaa tha ki sarkaar chaahati he ki reserve bank apane reserve khazaane se bainkon ke liye paisa de
 Will Shaktikanta Das sign the things against which Urjit Patel has resigned
 is vakt bainkon kaa enpie badhata ja rahaa he
 It is being said that many companies which cannot repay the loan are on the verge of bankruptcy, these industrialists want to save their companies
 chaahate hai ki bainkon se or karz mil jaae taaki purana hisaab chukaakar nayaa bahikhaata chaalu ho jaae
 This is the case
 governor shaktikant das ne media se baat karte hue saaf kar diya ki sarkaar hi arthvyavastha chalaati he
 Das has said that he will meet the executive officers of the banking sector
 unase baat karenge
 Will also meet private bankers
 financial express ke sunil jain ne twit kiya he ki kya shaktikant chupchaap vahi karenge jo vitt mantralay or aarthik maamalon ke sachiv urjit patel se chaahate the? piese ke niyamon main dheel denge, enpie par naram rukh apanaayenge, arabiai kaa reserve sarkaar ko saunp denge, laghu udyogon ko zyaada karz denge, board main sarkari nideshkon ko or adhikaar denge yaa apni raah par chalenge?tippaniyan PCA has to be understood
 ise pramt karactive ection hota he
 The Reserve Bank of India has framed the PCA rules
 kaha jaataa he ki sarkaar ko pataa nahin tha magar mint ne ek report chhaapi thi or daawa kiya tha ki donon pakshon ko pataa tha
 What happens under the PCA is that the Reserve Bank of India takes into account the banks whose npas exceed a ratio
 apni nigaraanee main lekar bainkon se kahata he ki ve nai branch na kholen, dividend na den, ek-ek paisa bachaaen or jo lone diya he use vasulein
 Do not give a new loan kuch khaas sector main lone dene se bachein
 Banks are asked to declare that loan as NPA if their loan installment does not come within 180 days
 enpie ghoshit karne se yah hoga ki us company ko aage ke liye lone nahin milegaa
 Even the bank will not be able to give loan
 bank ko paisa vasuul karnaa he
 At present, 11 banks are under PCA
 vivaad yahi he ki bhartiya reserve bank in 11 bainkon ko pisie niyamon kii kadai se mukt kare taaki lone bant sake
 It is feared that the NPA will increase again if the loans are distributed
 modi sarkaar ke samay MSME ko lone kam ho gaya he
 4 of GDP in 2013-14
 2 pratishat tha
 2 in 2017-18
 8 pratishat ho gaya
 Banks started giving loans to nbfcs through which loans were given to small scale industries
 jab se IL&FS kaa vivaad saamne aayaa he bainkon ne NBFC ko lone dena band kar diya he
 Due to this, small businesses are not getting loans
 us vakt bainkon ke baahar lambii kataron se janata pareshaan thi, haahaakaar machaa hua tha magar shaktikant das press ke saamne aae or bataane lage ki unhen report mili he ki kaala dhan badalane ke liye kuch log baar-baar linon main lag rahe hai, isliye kataren lambii hoti ja rahi hai
 His statement is that the reason for the long queues in banks and atms was that the same people are going to different places again and again
 isliye tab yah idia lekar aae ki cash counter par note badalane vaale logon kii ungali par chunaav ke samay istemaal hone vaali syaahi lagaai jaaegi
 The decision was severely criticized
 tab chunaav ayog ne vitt mantralay ko likh diya ki na mitane vaali syaahi ke istemaal se paanch rajyon main hone vaale matdaan kii prakriya par asar nahin padana chahie
 The announcement was made but when the ink did not reach the banks, banks started using the marker
 is faisle kaa majaak udne laga
 Shaktikanta Das has now become the Governor of the Reserve Bank
 jab notebandi ke samay poocha jaataa tha ki bhartiya reserve bank ke governor notebandi par kyon nahin bol rahe hai tab shaktikant das ne kaha tha ki koun bol rahaa he yah mahatvapurn nahin he
 i am speaking on behalf of the government
 isliye iskaa koi matlab nahin he ki main bol rahaa hum yaa koi or bol rahaa he
 Shaktikanta Das is a 1980 batch IAS officer
 itihaas vishay ke hai magar lambey samay tak aarthik maamalon se sambandhit vibhaagon main kaam kiya he
 Also did a management course from IIM
 pi chidambaram, pranab mukherjee or arun jetali ke saath vitt mantralay main kaam kar chuke hai
 He has done a course in Financial Management from IIM Bangalore
 itihaas se bie or eme karne vaale shaktikant das ke bare main kaha ja rahaa he ki ve maudik niti se sambandhit kaam ko kaise sanbhaalenge
 In response, departments related to their economic affairs are being introduced
 ve 28 saal main pehle aise governor hai jo arthshaastri nahin hai
 s Venkitaraman became the governor before him
 arabiai ke governor banane kii yah koi shart nahin he ki arthshaastri hi hoga
 Former governor d Subbarao has said that even a phd without economics can be a governor
 governor aisa vyakti hona chahie jis par bazaar bharosa kare
 Amit Ranjan Mishra has written that Das was a contender even after Rajan's departure
 ritair hone ke baad jab unke secority and exange board sebi ke chif banane kii charchaa ho rahi thi tab bijepi ke rajyasabha saansad subramanyam swami ne hangaamaa kar diya tha
 Wrote a letter to the Prime Minister that he was close to Chidambaram and indulged in corruption
 iske baad kaha jaataa he ki unhen sebi kaa mukhiya nahin banaaya gaya tha
 Subramanian Swamy has also given a statement today
 vaise pi chibandaram ne bhi shaktikant das ko governor banaae jane kii aalochana kii he
 It is said that Shaktikanta Das will follow the direction of the government
 ek arthshaastri kii jagah notebandi kaa samarthan karne vaale naukarshah ko chunane se is sanstha kii garima ko or thes pahonchegi
 The slaves who supported the ban on demonetisation are the other who have been elevated to the top post
 shaayad unka ishaara krishnamurthi subramanyam ko aarthik salaahkaar banaae jane ko lekar he
 Krishnamurthy Subramaniam also described demonetisation as beneficial
 chidambaram ne sawaal kiya he ki kya sarkaar logon ko yah sandesh dena chaahati he ki aap kya sochate hai, hamen parvaah nahin
 We will do what we like
 udhar, zyaadaatar maamalon main sarkaar ke har faisle kii tarif karne vaali do sansthaaen siaiai or fikki ne shaktikant das ko governor banaae jane kaa swaagat kiya he
 The chairman of FICCI has said that Shaktikanta Das has a 360 degree understanding of financial matters
 siii ke adhyaksh rakesh bharti mittal ne kaha he ki anbhavi aarthik export ko governor banaakar sarkaar ne sthiti ko sambhala he or niveshkon or industry main bahut zyaada bharosa paidaa kiya he
 We are confident that the flow of money to lend to banks and non-banking financial institutions will increase
 das tatkaal is samasya par dhyaan denge
 Was Urjit Patel not increasing the flow of money to the banks, did it mean that it was understood that the government wants the Reserve Bank to lend money to the banks from its reserves
 kya shaktikant das un baton par dastakhat karte chalenge jinke virodh main urjit patel ne istipha diya he
 The npas of banks are increasing at the moment
 kaha ja rahaa he ki lone lekar nahin chukaa paane vaali kai companiyaan diwalia hone ke kagaar par hai, ye udyogpati apni companiyon ko bachaa lenaa chaahate hai
 Want to get more loan from banks so that new bookkeeping can be started after paying old accounts
 motaa-moti yahi baat he
 Governor Shaktikanta Das while talking to the media made it clear that the government runs the economy
 das ne kaha he ki ve banking sector ke kaaryakari adhikariyon se milenge
 Will talk to them nijee bankeron se bhi milenge
 Sunil Jain of Financial Express tweeted that Shaktikanth will do what he wanted from Finance Ministry and Economic Affairs Secretary Urjit Patel? Will the PSA rules be relaxed, will take a soft approach on npas, hand over RBI reserves to the government, give more loans to small scale industries, give more powers to government directors on the board or go on their way? pisie ko samajhnaa hoga
 This is a prompt corrective action
 bhartiya reserve bank ne pisie ke niyam banaae hai
 The government is said to have been unaware but Mint had published a report and claimed that both sides knew
 pisie ke tahat hota yah he ki bhartiya reserve bank un bainkon ko apni nigaraanee main le letaa he jinka enpie ek anupaat se bahut zyaada ho jaataa he
 Under his supervision, he tells the banks not to open a new branch, do not give dividends, save every penny and recover the loan given
 nayaa lone nahin den
 Avoid lending in certain sectors
 bainkon se kaha jaataa he ki agar unke lone kii kisht 180 dinon main nahin aati he to us lone ko enpie ghoshit kar den
 Declaring an NPA will mean that the company will not get a loan for further
 bank bhi lone nahin de sakegaa
 The bank has to recover the money
 is vakt 11 bank pisie ke tahat hai
 The controversy is that the Reserve Bank of India should free these 11 banks from the strict PCA rules so that loans can be distributed
 ashanka yah he ki lone bantane lage to phir se enpie badhegaa
 Loan to MSME has reduced during the Modi government
 2013-14 main jidipi kaa 4

 kaha ja rahaa he ki lone lekar nahin chukaa paane vaali kai companiyaan diwalia hone ke kagaar par hai, ye udyogpati apni companiyon ko bachaa lenaa chaahate hai
 Want to get more loan from banks so that new bookkeeping can be started after paying old accounts
 motaa-moti yahi baat he
 Speaking to the media, Governor Shaktikanta Das made it clear that the government runs the economy
 das ne kaha he ki ve banking sector ke kaaryakari adhikariyon se milenge
 Will talk to them nijee bankeron se bhi milenge
 Sunil Jain of Financial Express tweeted that Shaktikanth will do what he wanted from Finance Ministry and Economic Affairs Secretary Urjit Patel? Will the PSA rules be relaxed, will take a soft approach on npas, hand over RBI reserves to the government, give more loans to small scale industries, give more powers to government directors on the board or go on their way? pisie ko samajhnaa hoga
 This is a prompt corrective action
 bhartiya reserve bank ne pisie ke niyam banaae hai
 The government is said to have been unaware but Mint had published a report and claimed that both sides knew
 pisie ke tahat hota yah he ki bhartiya reserve bank un bainkon ko apni nigaraanee main le letaa he jinka enpie ek anupaat se bahut zyaada ho jaataa he
 Under his supervision, he tells the banks not to open a new branch, do not give dividends, save every penny and recover the loan given
 nayaa lone nahin den
 Avoid lending in certain sectors
 bainkon se kaha jaataa he ki agar unke lone kii kisht 180 dinon main nahin aati he to us lone ko enpie ghoshit kar den
 Declaring an NPA will mean that the company will not get a loan for further
 bank bhi lone nahin de sakegaa
 The bank has to recover the money
 is vakt 11 bank pisie ke tahat hai
 The controversy is that the Reserve Bank of India should free these 11 banks from the strict PCA rules so that loans can be distributed
 ashanka yah he ki lone bantane lage to phir se enpie badhegaa
 Loan to MSME has reduced during the Modi government
 2013-14 main jidipi kaa 4
 Was 2 percent
 2017-18 main 2
 8 percent
 bank NBFC ko lone dene lage jiske jariye laghu udyogon ko lone diya jane lage
 Banks have stopped lending to nbfcs ever since the IL&FS dispute broke out
 isse chote bijness ko lone nahin mil rahaa he
 Das has said that he will meet the executive officers of the banking sector
 unase baat karenge
 Will also meet private bankers
 financial express ke sunil jain ne twit kiya he ki kya shaktikant chupchaap vahi karenge jo vitt mantralay or aarthik maamalon ke sachiv urjit patel se chaahate the? piese ke niyamon main dheel denge, enpie par naram rukh apanaayenge, arabiai kaa reserve sarkaar ko saunp denge, laghu udyogon ko zyaada karz denge, board main sarkari nideshkon ko or adhikaar denge yaa apni raah par chalenge?tippaniyan PCA has to be understood
 ise pramt karactive ection hota he
 The Reserve Bank of India has framed the PCA rules
 kaha jaataa he ki sarkaar ko pataa nahin tha magar mint ne ek report chhaapi thi or daawa kiya tha ki donon pakshon ko pataa tha
 What happens under the PCA is that the Reserve Bank of India takes into account the banks whose npas exceed a ratio
 apni nigaraanee main lekar bainkon se kahata he ki ve nai branch na kholen, dividend na den, ek-ek paisa bachaaen or jo lone diya he use vasulein
 Do not give a new loan kuch khaas sector main lone dene se bachein
 Banks are asked to declare that loan as NPA if their loan installment does not come within 180 days
 enpie ghoshit karne se yah hoga ki us company ko aage ke liye lone nahin milegaa
 Even the bank will not be able to give loan
 bank ko paisa vasuul karnaa he
 At present, 11 banks are under PCA
 vivaad yahi he ki bhartiya reserve bank in 11 bainkon ko pisie niyamon kii kadai se mukt kare taaki lone bant sake
 It is feared that the NPA will increase again if the loans are distributed
 modi sarkaar ke samay MSME ko lone kam ho gaya he
 4 of GDP in 2013-14
 2 pratishat tha
 2 in 2017-18
 8 pratishat ho gaya
 Banks started giving loans to nbfcs through which loans were given to small scale industries
 jab se IL&FS kaa vivaad saamne aayaa he bainkon ne NBFC ko lone dena band kar diya he
 Due to this, small businesses are not getting loans
 pisie ko samajhnaa hoga

 When Anand Singh Rawat, son of Congress Party MP from Haridwar and Union Minister of State for Labor and Employment Harish Rawat, was elected President of the Uttarakhand unit of the Youth Congress (YC) on 16 May this year, it became clear once again that the Congress General Secretary This organization, which is under the patronage of Rahul Gandhi, has failed to implement its own advice
 haalanki rahul ne sitambar, 2007 main kaarybhaar sanbhaalane ke baad se congress kii yuva ikai se 'parivaarwaad, sangrakshanvaad or dhanabal' ko samaapt karne kaa apana sapana kisi se nahin chipaaya
 But under his supervision, only in the first election of the Yukan in Punjab in December 2008, candidates were well-known in various positions, whose relatives were well-known or had the grace of senior leaders
 vastav main jin 17 rajyon / ikaayiyon main ukan ke padaadhikari chune gaye, unamem se aath congress netaaon ke rishtedaar the jo alag-alag padon par baithe hai
 Of the remaining nine units of the YC, five functionaries have the support of senior leaders

 Bittu is said to have the support of former Chief Minister Amarinder Singh

 Similarly, in Jharkhand, the vice-president and general secretary of the state is the son of senior Congress leaders in the state, while Deepika Pandey Singh, secretary of the National Committee of the Indian Youth Congress, is the daughter of Congress party leader Pratibha Pandey from Jharkhand
 yuvak congress kaaryakartaaon ke ek varg kaa kahana he ki pariwarik sampark hona jaruri he
 a Yukan leader said, "rahul Gandhi, the crown prince of the nehru-gandhi dynasty, is being said to follow the footsteps of his father, grandmother and great-grandfather
 duusare anya netaaon ke bacchon ko bhi unase prerit hone se roka nahin ja saktaa
 Political patronage appeared in youth congress units, where dynasticism played no role in electing office-bearers
 madhya pradesh ukan ke adhyaksh priyavrat singh congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ke samarthak kahe jate hai, jabaki jharkhand ukan ke adhyaksh maanas sinha ke liye kaha jaataa he ki un par kendriya paryaton mantri subodhakant sahay kii krupa he
 There is no end to the list of political appointments
 desh bhar main ukan ke pramukh padon ko congress ke varisht netaaon ke parivaar ke sadasyon yaa unke vafaadaaron ne hathiyaa rakhaa he
 While it is difficult to get rid of the system promoting such protectionism, Team Rahul's youth unit has failed to curb dynastic control
 india today ke saath baatcheet main saatav ne yadhyapi jor dekar kaha ki ukan apane cader kaa 95 pratishat gaiyr-rajnatik pariwaron se khadaa karata he
 a section of Yukan activists blame the electoral college model for continuing protectionism in the youth unit
 uskaa aarope he ki nirvaachak mandal ke pratinidhiyon ko, jo ukan sansthaaon ke sadsy hai, 'pryojit' kiya jaataa hai
 These institutions have been set up in each assembly constituency to elect the Speaker, Vice President and General Secretary
 ukan ke ek sadsy ne kaha, ''in pratinidhiyon ko namakan fees ke rup main acchhee khaasi rakam deni padati he
 Since such a huge amount is received from all the delegates that anyone who wishes to become an officer, who has a heavy pocket, gets ready to sponsor them
 isse pataa chalata he ki chunaav main dhan-bal kii kitni badi bhoomika he
 The Youth Congress under Rahul's leadership has also struggled to get rid of the youth with questionable image
 yuvak congress kii website ke anusaar un logon ko kuch sharton ke saath sadsyta dene kii peshkash kii jaati he jinaki pratishtha main koi aanch nahin ai he or jinhen apradhi nahin tehraaya gaya he
 Although many of the members of the Yukan could not be proved to be guilty but due to their past record they could not pass the test of 'good image'
 disambar 2010 main bihar ukan netaa mayank kumaar urf munna ko apane mitra rohit kii hatya ke silsile main giraftaar kar liya gaya tha

 Even though the Youth Congress has once again become active in politics, but it still does not have the strength
 tamilnadu or usase pehle bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ne dikhaa diya ki hakeekat main bahut kuch nahin badla he
 Rahul Gandhi spent a lot of time in both these states
 haalanki rahul ke bhartee abhiyaan ke kaaran tamilnadu main inaki sadsy sankhya 12

 The situation worsened in Tamil Nadu where 34,26,432 votes or 9 of the total votes in favor of the Congress
 3 pratishat hi mila
 Congress contested 63 seats there
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki ki ukan ke 12
 Each of the 92 lakh members could not even arrange three votes

 At the moment it is clear that the approach of the two investigating agencies is different from each other
 bharat kaa daawa he ki seemaa paar se ghuspaith kar hamalaa kiya gaya he, jabaki pakistan kah rahaa he ki seemaa kii suraksha dekhte hue ghuspaith mumkin nahin
 India has given DNA samples of an attacker, but Pakistan says whom to match it - the same thing is being said about the voice samples - India is saying - Pakistan reached the terrorists, while Pakistan says Intrigue did not happen to him
 jaahir he, paak jeiti ko bharat aane dene kaa maamla sawaalon se ghir gaya he
 If the government is giving a clarification about this, then the opposition is attacking
 sarkaar ke varisht mantri mantri venkaiya naidu kaa kahana he, "pakistan ko saafe karnaa he ki aatankwaad ko lekar uskaa kya rukh he wo kabhi haa kabhi naa nahin kah saktaa
 "congress leader Sandeep Dixit used to say," Those who got attacked, we are calling them and you ask that you investigate
 " By coincidence, Pakistan claimed to have captured an Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav at the time Pakistan JIT was visiting India
 jaahir he, bharat-pakistan ke bich bharose kii kami saafe dikh rahi he
 This deficiency was also noticed during the investigation of JIT
 enie kaa kahana he ki bharat ne pakistan ko puure saboot die
 Masood also gave the names of Rauf Kashif and Latif Sharif, offering that the investigation team should see the bodies of the slain terrorists, but the Pakistani team refused
 tippaniyan Now India is talking about taking help from the world's best test labs to give a more robust look to its investigation
 ye saaf he ki ye rassakashi der tak chalati rahegi
 On the other hand, India is aware that Pakistan will not give importance to the evidence given by it, hence it is now seeking help from the US and FBI to investigate the calls that happened when the attack took place

 ittifaq se jis samay paak jeiti bharat kaa daura kar rahi thi usee samay pakistan ne ek bhartiya jasoos kulbhushan jadhav ko pakadaney kaa daawa kiya
 Clearly, the lack of trust between India and Pakistan is clearly visible
 jeiti kii jaanch ke dauraan bhi ye kami dikhi
 The NIA says that India provided complete evidence to Pakistan
 masood rauf kaashif or latif shareef ke naam bhi die, ye peshkash bhi kii ki jaanch team maare gaye aatankiyon ke shav dekh le, lekin paak team ne inkaar kar diya
 The comments ab bharat apni jaanch ko or pukhta rup dene ke liye duniya kii behtareen jaanch lab kii madad lene kii baat kah rahaa he
 It is clear that this tug of war will continue for a long time
 udhar bharat janata he ki pakistan uske dwaara die gaye sabooton ko ahmiyat nahin degaa isiilie ab wo america or FBI se madad maang rahaa he taaki un kol ke bare main jaanch kii ja sake jo us samay hue jab hamalaa ho rahaa tha

 Political enthusiasts have once again intensified in view of the by-elections in 20 assembly seats in Delhi
 shanivaar subah dilli ke tamaam ilaakon main mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke saath lalu yadav ke poster lagaae gaye hai
 In these posters, Arvind Kejriwal has been accused of keeping silence on the punishment given to Lalu Yadav
 dilli bijepi pravaktaa tejinder bagga ne poster jari karte hue kaha ki anna andolan ke samay arvind kejariwal lalu yadav par nishaanaa sadhate the lekin har mudde par bolne vaale kejariwal ab lalu yadav kisaja par puri tarah maunhai
 The poster reads, 'why is the so-called honest chief minister silent on the punishment of his friend Lalu Yadav'? That is, Kejriwal's honesty is said to be so-called and Lalu Yadav his friend in the poster
 bataa den ki chaara ghotaale ke alag-alag maamalon main jab se bihar ke purv siem lalu yadav ko sajaa hui he tabhi se arvind kejariwal ki is mudde par chuppi raajnneetik halkon main lagaataar charchaa kaa vishay bani hui he
 The reason for this is the Anna movement against corruption in Delhi from where the Aam Aadmi Party emerged
 anna andolan ke vakt siem kejariwal mukhar hokerlalu yadav par nishanasadha karte the
 After 20 disqualified Aam Aadmi Party mlas in Delhi, the election cloud has been hovering over 20 seats, BJP has targeted Kejriwal by issuing posters, so obviously the electoral outcry is still trying in the political arena

 This was stated by Union Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda on 26 March in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, inaugurating the Rotavirus vaccine Rotavac in the National Immunization Program
 unhen shaayad hi anumaan rahaa hoga ki unki is raah main apane hi rode atakaayenge
 The rss-affiliated Swadeshi Jagran Manch has questioned the government's support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in developing the rotavirus vaccine manufactured in India, warning the government that the Foundation will not help in its suggested work, on behalf of the people of the country Recommended work should be taken only
 manch ke rashtriya sah sanyojak ashvini mahajan kehete hai, ''bill and melinda gates foundation kii daanveerta thik he, lekin yah bhi tathy he ki uske board main swasthya kshetra kii multinational companiyaan baithi hai jinke apane hit swaabhaavik honge
 "rotavac manufactured in India has been implemented by the government in the first phase in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh
" yahaan bacchon ko muft tikaa uplabdh karaayaa ja rahaa he
 But now Health Minister Nadda's problem is that the Swadeshi advocacy body is raising serious questions on the vaccine manufactured in the country which they consider to be epoch-making
 manch ke is tarah mukhar hone ke baad yah bahes chhidane lagi he ki bharat jaise desh main is rotawiras tike kii jarurat he yaa nahin? iske alaava tike ke trial or uske asar ko lekar hue adhyayan par bhi sawaal uthne lage hai
 Why are questions arising? Rotavirus is a type of infectious virus that causes gastroenteritis, vomiting and diarrhea, especially in children up to five years of age
 swasthya mantralay main sanyukt sachiv (ab bhartiya aushadhi anusandhan parishad isimr main sthanantarit) dow
 Rakesh Kumar says, "of the number of children dying in the world from rotavirus, every fifth child is Indian
 '' sarkaar kaa kahana he ki isi ko dhyaan main rakhkar rashtriya kaarykram main rotawiras ke tike ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 But the process and the effect of developing the Rotavac vaccine in India is raising questions
 ise hyderabad kii company bharat biotech ne banaaya he, jise varsh 2000 main bill and melinda gates foundation ne chunaa tha jabaki us vakt is company ke paas apana koi licency utpaada nahin tha
 Bharat Biotech was also funded by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India
 dilachasp yah he ki company ko sahaayta dete vakt sarkaar ne koi emoyu nahin kiya
 Not only this, is the foundation that helped the Indian company not a violation of FCRA? "the foundation is not registered under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA)," says Mahajan
 modi sarkaar ne epasiare ke tahat panjikrut videshi sahaayta praapt karne vaale 15,000 videshi sansthaaon ke license radd kar die the, lekin gates foundation usase achoota rahaa kyonki gates foundation pheraa nahin, femaa ke tahat ek sampark offis ke taur par kaam karata he, isliye epasiare se bachaa rahaa
 "they also add that vaccination is commendable, but first we have to decide our needs ourselves
" prabhavit ho rahi he nitiyaan!vaxin ke maamle main sarkaar kii nitigat prakriya bhi sawaalon ke ghere main he
 The recommendation of the National Technical Advisory Group of Equalization (natagi), the institution of the Ministry of Health, is necessary before choosing any vaccine
 lekin 2013 main natagi ko sahyog dene ke liye ikvaunijeshan technical saport unit (itsu) kaa gathan kiya gaya, jiskaa kaam baithak kaa byora, agenda, prajentation tay karne ke alaava samanvay karnaa he
 But according to ministry sources, the interesting aspect is that all the 32 members of Itsu are elected by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and they also get salary from the Foundation
 is tathy kii pushti karte hue mantralay ke adhikariyon kii daleel he ki kaam kaa dayera bad chukaa he aise main natagi ko sachivalay kii suvidha itsu se milti he
 But in an e-mail conversation with India Today about this, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation says, "no employees of the Foundation are employed in Itsu and every policy decision related to vaccination comes under the purview of the Government of India
 ham yah bhi kahana chahenge ki agast 2013 main hamane public health foundation of india (piechaephai) ko itsu sthapit karne ke liye anudaan diya tha
 The unit was set up under an mou with the government to provide managerial and technical support to the Ministry of Health
 ''sawaal uth rahaa he ki videshi sanstha ke liye kaam karne vaale bhale mantralay kii andruni charchaa ko prabhavit nahin kar paaenge lekin isse shaayad hi inkaar kiya ja saktaa he ki baithak kii khabaren or rukh us sanstha tak nahin pahunchati hongi
 Says a member of Natagi, "itsu not only makes the agenda but also how to note which point of the meeting depends on it
 baithak main koun-sa prajentation yaa paper rakhaa jayega yah bhi itsu tay karata he
 Mahajan also quotes from the report of Britain's Global Justice Now that the Gates Foundation is using its influence to devise policies in the interests of large multinational companies engaged in agriculture and medicine
 ' unke mutabik, is report ke baad hi bharat sarkaar ne foundation ko nigaraanee suchi main daal diya he
 He says that in the Ministry of Health, 365 expert advisors used to advise who were appointed by foreign companies, not the Ministry
 haalanki mantralay ke adhikari 365 kii baat khaarij karte hai lekin maanate hai ki badhate kaam or fouran nattejey dene ke dabaav se visheshgy rakhane hi honge
 The government is dismissing the allegation of a policy decision under the influence of a foreign entity
 swasthya mantralay kaa kahana he ki kisi bhi vaxin ko lagu karne main chaar-paanch saal kaa vakt lag jaataa he
 Two meetings of the Technical sub-committee on Rotavac took place in December 2013 and April 2014, when the UPA government was at the center
 lekin is bare main sifarish karne vaali badi sanstha natagi kii baithak centre main narendra modi kii sarkaar banane ke baad june 2014 main hui jisamen rotawiras vaxin ko saarvbhaumik tikaakaran kaarykram main shaamil karne kaa faisla sarvasammati kii bajaae bahumat se liya gaya
 After this, on March 9, 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Rotavac vaccine
 ek adhikari kehete hai, ''ham technical sab cameti or natagi kii siforeeshon par kaam karte hai, gates foundation kii salaah par nahin
 The vaccine was included in the program after a meeting of the sub-committee twice, Natagi followed by the EPC (empowered Program Committee which has the Health Secretary) and then the MSG (mission Study Group which discusses ministerial level)
 '' gates foundation kaa bhi kahana he ki vah 2000 (tab centre main atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar thi) se bharat main centre or rajya sarkaron ke saath saajhedaari kar logon ko behatar or swasth jivan dene kii disha main kaam kar rahaa he
 Why Suspect Vaccine and Trial? Sources in the Ministry of Health suggest that on one hand the Foundation chose an Indian company that had no experience in the field of vaccine, but helped it to develop the vaccine
 duusari taraf aankadon ko dhaal banaate hue vaxin ko sarkari program main shaamil karne kii pairvi kii jo nijee hit ko darshata he
 But the Gates Foundation rejects such allegations
 apane jawaab main foundation kahata he, ''bharat main rotawiras tike ke utpaadan or vitaran main uskaa koi vyavsaayik hit nahin he
 The Government of India is solely responsible for the selection, purchase and distribution of this vaccine for its program
 ''haalanki bharat or america main vaxin ke trial main antar hiton ke takaraav kii ore hi ishaara kar rahaa he
 In the US, in 1998, when the Rotashield vaccine trial was conducted on 10,000 children, it was found to have intussusception (one part of the intestine going into the other) in 3 children, after which it was banned
 iske baad rotatech vaxin kaa trial 60,000 par karaayaa gaya
 But the India-made Rotavac trial was conducted on a very small scale at just 6,799 children in three centers in the country - Vellore, Pune, Delhi with 4,532 being vaccinated
 sarkaar ke mutabik, is adhyayan main 23 intssepshan ke cese paae gaye
 Even if this figure is studied on a large scale, 37 out of 10,000 because of rotavac
 5 bachche intssepshan kaa shikaar hue to bina tike ke 26
 36 children
 yani 11 cese zyada paae gaye
 But the deputy commissioner of the ministry, Drs
 pradeep haldaar kaa kahana he ki vaxin ke bina bhi har saal 1 lakh bacchon main se 48-50 intssepshan ke cese milte hai
 But in terms of this figure too, if we look at the study that came out of the trial of Rotavac, because of the vaccine, 110 cases per one lakh children are added to it
 natagi ke sadsy or baithak main rotawiras vaxin ko lagu karne ke faisle par asahmati note dene vaale bal rog visheshgy or saint stephens aspataal dilli main vibhaagadhyaksh dow
 Jacob Pulial tells India Today, "looking at the government data, the Rotavac vaccine has five to ten times the risk of intussusception from the fda-approved rotashield vaccine in the US, and 70 times more than the internationally licensed vaccine Rotatec
 ''unka yah bhi aarope he ki jaanboojhkar sample sies kam rakhaa gaya taaki intssepshan kaa nateeja spasht na dikhe isliye vellore main hue trial kaa aankada saarvajanik nahin kiya ja rahaa, jahaan sabase zyada intssepshan hue or teenon kendron kaa aankada milakar nateeja nikaal liya gaya
 unicef's Health Specialist Drs
 satish gupta bhi maanate hai ki bharat main hue trial kaa sample sies chota tha
 He says that it has been started in four states and is being monitored
 agar in rajyon main intssepshan ke maamle badhate hai to ise roka bhi ja saktaa he
 According to the ministry, only one crore doses of the Rotavac vaccine were available due to the phase-wise implementation

 Sukkabul Warsi also believes that there has not been a large-scale trial in India, so his data will not be accurate

 Swadeshi Jagran Manch says that therefore vaccination should not be done according to foreign companies
 lekin swasthya mantralay kii daleel he ki rotawiras kaa swatchta jaisi desi paristhitiyon se koi lenadena nahin he or isse nipatane ke liye tikaa hi ekmaatr vikalp he
 Dr
 of UNICEF
 gupta kehete hai, ''rota kaa sanitessan se koi matlab nahin he
 However, the vaccine cannot prevent diarrhea completely
 isse sirf ek-tihaai hi cover hoga, baaki ke liye sanitessan or oares chahie hoga
 '' But Dr
 varsi kaa maananaa he ki vaxin ko antim vikalp ke taur par hi apanaaya janaa chahie
 She says, "it is true that the number of deaths from diarrhea is high but to tackle this we must first emphasize on all hygiene measures
" agar swatchta par jor nahin denge to vaxin bhi koi asar nahin karegi
 She also says that the impact of the vaccine in western countries is close to 90 percent because there is a focus on cleanliness, whereas in India it is close to 50 percent
 haalanki unicef ke visheshgy kii daleel he ki videshi or bhartiya donon vaxin kaa asar 60-62 fisadi he
 But on the questions arising about the rotavirus vaccine, the additional secretary of the ministry, Dr
 si
 K
 mishra or tatkaaleen sanyukt sachiv dow
 Rakesh Kumar says, "the rotavirus vaccine has been in operation at a private level since 2009
 tab kisi ne sawaal nahin uthaaya
 Now, when the vaccine for 4-5 thousand is being provided free of cost to the poor, then why is there so much hype? '' But the member of the big body Natagi associated with the decision of government vaccination, Dr
 pulial kaa kahana he ki diaria kaa sabase behtareen ilaaj pani main namak-chini kaa ghol hi he or iske saath swatchta kaa khaas dhyaan rakhana chahie
 They believe that the biggest side effect of the rotavac vaccine may be in the villages
 vahaan visheshgy nahin hote
 In case of intussusception, the poor cannot afford his treatment
 lekin gates foundation kii raay in doctoron kii raay se bilkul alag he
 He argues, "vaccines are important for the widespread prevention and control of the disease and are part of a broader solution to reduce infant mortality
 ye rog kii rokthaam or karodon jindagiyon ko bachaane kaa sabase surakshit or kifayati upaay he
 "the ministry also believes that intussusception cannot be ignored, so full monitoring is being done
" rotawiras vaxin ke trial ke vellore ke aankade ko saarvajanik karne kii maang ko lekar dow
 Pulial had filed a PIL in the Delhi High Court, but as Puliyal himself is a member of Natagi, the court did not consider the demand for confidential data to be suitable for the PIL

 The court said that the class was going on and during this time, the accused boy told his classmate that he wanted to have sex with him

 The incident is two years old in Wales in the UK

 The first news is that Lalu Prasad Yadav will be sentenced on Thursday in a fodder scam case
 pehle yah buudhvaar ko sunaaya janaa tha
 The second news is that a special CBI court has issued a contempt notice against former Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav and three other leaders of the Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress
 adaalat ne avmaananaa kaa yah notice chaar logon par chaara ghotaale main doshi rajd adhyaksh lalu prasad ke sandarbh main unke bayaan ke liye jari kiya he
 Among these three leaders are senior RJD leader and former minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, RJD spokesman Manoj Jha and Congress leader Manish Tiwari
 asal main 23 disambar ko chaara ghotaale main lalu prasad ko doshi tehraaya gaya tab rajd netaaon ne bihar ke purv mukhyamantri jagannatha mishra ko bari kiye jane par sawaal uthaae the
 He had said that if he is a Brahmin from the Mishra caste, he was acquitted and Lalu belongs to a backward caste and was convicted
 is notice ke jawaab main in sabhi ko 23 janvari ko adaalat main pesh hona hoga
 This means that the RJD is stuck in a deep crisis
 lalu yadav us vakt jail main hai jab party ko unki sabase zyada jarurat thi
 The more days Lalu Prasad stays in jail, the more the miseries of the party will increase
 lekin ab ek yaksha prashn or khadaa he ki aakhir lalu prasad kii gairmaujuudagi main party kaa khewanhaar koun banegaa? ab rajd ke varisht netaa raghuvansh prasad singh ne maan liya he ki tejasvi yadav hi rajd adhyaksh ke uttaradhikari honge
 It is right that Tejashwi has little respect for his balanced and mature politics
 lekin yah bhi tay he ki abhi pita ke saanche main unhen feet hone main vakt lagegaa
 On the other hand, his elder brother Tej Pratap is more aggressive and confrontational
 aise main agar raghuvansh prasad singh ne yah kaha ki niyam se or kanoonee taur par pita ke baad bete kaa haq hota he or tejasvi lalu ji ke bete hai
 In such a situation, all people consider him as the heir
 saath hi, rajd ke kai varisht netaaon jaise jagadanand singh, abdul baari siddiki, ramchandra purve, shivanand tiwari ke alaava kai purv mantriyon evam vidhayakon ko raghuvansh kii baat par etraj ho saktaa he kyonki tejasvi yadav par bhi kai jaanch agenciyon ke aarope hai
 In such a situation, if Tejashwi falls under legal scrutiny and goes to jail, will RJD accept Tejashwi? vanshavaad bharat main koi nai baat nahin he
 It is also not about dynasty in the RJD, because when Lalu went to jail, instead of handing the chair to a powerful leader, wife Rabri Devi went to the Chief Minister
 logon ko acha nahin laga tha kyonki tab yah mana jaataa tha ki lalu saamaajik nyaay ke purodha hai or unka party samaajawaadee siddhanton ko aage badhaane kii disha main kaam kar rahi he
 An article on dynastic domination in India by Patrick French, his study of three years ago shows that every MP under the age of 30 in the Lok Sabha in India has a relationship with the political dynasty
 duniya main aisi ghatana kahin or hoti to hangaamaa ho jaataa, lekin ham bharatiyon ne ise manjuur kar liya he
 Patrick French has written, "if this trend continues, only the family politicians will remain in the Indian Parliament, and the country will be ruled completely by the dynasties
" iskaa arth kya yah nahin hua ki french bharat main nae rajavaadon ke udai kaa elaan kar rahe hai!raghuvansh prasad ke bayaan ko usee sandarbhon main lijie to tasviir zyada badtar najar aati he jahaan unke jaisaa tapa-tapaaya netaa yuvaraj kii viraasat par muhar laga rahaa he
 The voter is also voting on the basis of their religion, caste and surname
 (ab yah chaunkaane vaali baat to kattai na rahi)baharhaal, sthapit siyaasi rujhaanon ke khilaaf khadey lalu kaa khandaan pehle bhale hi thopa lagata ho, lekin party ke senior netaa jab is odhane ke liye taiyaar hon, to isse swasth sanket nahin milte
 The leadership of Tejashwi may be acceptable to the big leaders, but his path will not be easy
 lalu ke salaakhon ke peeche hone se sirf tejasvi yadav hi nahin, tejpratap ko bhi party ke 80 vidhayakon se nibatna hoga
 In politics, it is meaningless to expect that the JD-U and BJP alliance will not try to sabotage them
 aise main party main dalbadal or foot kaa khatra rahegaa
 However, whenever Lalu has traveled to jail, it has proved to be a booster in his career, as it was after the Emergency and he won the first Lok Sabha election
 lekin, san satahattar se aaj kii taarikh main chalis saal kaa fark he, kahani thodi alahada ho gai he
 (manjeet Thakur is Special Correspondent in India Today) dharm kii aad main paakhand kii sultanate chalaa rahe ram rahim kii asaliyat to kab kii saamne aa gai
 But now one such revelation has been revealed about Ram Rahim, which is the most different
 ram rahim ke dere kii talaashi main police ko khufia camere, pen drive or saikadon hard discs samet kai aisi chizein mili hai, jinka istemaal aam taur par jasusi ke liye hota he
 So did Ram Rahim spy on people coming to the camp and VVIP
 kya unki nigaraanee kii jaati thi
 If that was the case then why did you hear what Baba does? magar jo babaram rahimane bataaya wo adhuraa he
 Hear from us full baba sirf ga nahin lete hai
 They also take singing
 naachte hai to nachaa bhi dete hai
 Actor, director, producer
 doctor
 Apart from master and preaching, Baba is also a player
 wo bhi itane bade khilaadi kii andaaza lagaana mushkil he
 According to the new game of Baba, which we are going to disclose, Baba is also a James Bond
 wo bhi chote mote nahin
 Sherlockhomes
 karamchand or byomekash bakshi se bade vaale jasoos hai baba
 After the court order, many surprise secrets are coming out in the search of Ram Rahim's Sirsa camp
 court kamishnar kii khufia report ajtak ke haath lagi he, or ye report jo bataa rahi he wo ram rahim ke khilaaf lage ab tak ke sabase sangeen aaropon kaa jinda saboot he
 According to the sanitation report submitted by the Punjab Commissioner in the Punjab Haryana High Court, an OB van, five spy cameras, 68 hard disks have been recovered from Baba's camp
 jisamen se 65 hard discs 2 brifces main chhipaai gayi thim
 Even before this, 65 hard disks have been recovered from the camp
 ashram se ab tak kul 133 hard discs baraamad ho chuki hai
 Apart from this, 11 pen drives have also been found from the ashram
 isse pehle bhi ashram se 92 pen drive mil chuki hai
 Thus far 103 pen drives have been received from the ashram
 ashram se 166 sidi, 17 laptop or 9 computer baraamad hue hai
 29 mobile phones have been found from the ashram
 isamen se ek mobile phone ko todane kii koshish bhi hui thi
 Court Commissioner AKS Panwar has seized all these items from Nedra Sacha Sauda Ashram
 magar ab senetigeshan report main mili hue saamaanon ke aadhaar par kayaas lagane shuru ho gaye hai ki baba kii niyat main kuch na kuch to khot tha
 Otherwise Obi Van, which uplinks the video
 or spai camere jisase khufia video banaae jate hai unki baba ke ashram ko zarurat kya thi
 If there is a suspicion of intelligence cameras, computers and CD pen drives recovered from the whereabouts of a man who calls himself a saint, then it is a matter of doubt
 or agar ye shaks gurmeet singh urf ram rahim ho tab to pakkaa maniye ki deraa ke naam par kuch or hi khel chal rahaa tha
 What was this game iskaa raaj fash hone hi vaala he
 Baba is suffering because of fear of losing his kingdom, that he has requested the court to keep his secrets away from the eyes of the media
 baba ke dere se baraamad hue in sandigdh saamaanon ke baad ab sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya ram rahim jasusi kii gatividhiyon main lipt tha? kya ram rahim ke taar kisi jasusi sanstha se jude hai? kya ram rahim desh kii suraksha khatre main daalane vaala tha? ram rahim ne ashram main spai camere kyon lagavaaye the? kya hard discs main jasusi yaa sting ke video hai? ram rahim kiski jasusi karata tha or kyon?lekin khulaase bas itane hi nahin hai
 Many more things have come to light, for example, 17 jars with human skin have been recovered from the camp
 dere ke aspataal se garbhpaat se sambandhit 6 file baraamad hui hai
 Apart from all these, 7 diaries have also been recovered from the camp
 khud ko massenger of god kehane vaale shaks ke deraa aspataal ke skin bank ko jab license hi nahin mila tha to use donor kahaan se mili
 6 abortion files were found from the hospital which are asking the question, why did the abortion come to the saint's ashram? And in those seven diaries, Kis Kis's raw letter is closed
 ab aage kii jaanch main inhen sab sawaalon ke jawaab jaanch agenciyon ko talash karne hai
 Just before the Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has made a dent in the SP-BSP alliance in Uttar Pradesh
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke garh kahe jane gorakhpur main jeet hasil karne ke liye bijepi sapa ke maujuuda saansad praveen nishad ko apana pratyaashee bana sakati he
 But Samajwadi Party has also found the answer to this break of BJP
 nishad party or endie kii baatcheet abhi kisi mukaam tak pahunchati isse pehle hi sapa ne yahaan se phir ek baar nishad ummidavaar ko tikat de diya he
 SP has fielded Rambhual Nishad in place of Pravin Nishad
 bataa den ki mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kisi bhi haal main gorakhpur loksabhaa seat ko apane haath se nahin jane dena chaahate hai
 Because his mentor Mahant Avaidyanath used to be MP from here, after this Yogi Adityanath was elected as MP continuously from 1998
 2017 main siem banane ke baad unhone tyaagptr de diya tha
 In the subsequent by-elections, the BJP had insisted that this seat be retained, but the SP shattered this dream
 aise main yogi or party manthan kar rahe hai ki yahaan se kise tikat die jaae jisase kisi bhi haal main yah seat bijepi ke paas rahe
 Yogi and Sanjay Nishad met: On Sunday, Pravin Nishad's father Sanjay Nishad met Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow
 donon kii mulaakaat ke baad se ye charchaa hone lagi thi ki donon partiyaan saath chunaav lard sakati hai
 After meeting Yogi Adityanath, Sanjay Nishad said that the UP CM assured me that our complaints will be heard and dealt with
 unhone kaha ki nishad party apane simbel par chunaav ladegi
 The NDA will decide who will contest from where
 jaankaree ke mutabik bijepi nishad party ko gorakhpur or jonpur seat de sakati he
 While Pravin Nishad can get a ticket from Gorakhpur, former Jaunpur MP Dhananjay Singh Nishad can be a candidate from the party
 isliye nishad ummidavaar par daanv laga rahi hai partiyambta den ki gorakhpur main 3
 5 lakh voters are from Nishad caste
 inhen nishad voters ne pichley saal hue upachunaav main praveen nishad kii jeet main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 The SP and BSP fielded a common candidate in the by-election
 isse pehle ke chunaavon main bhi sapa or basapa nishad jati ke logon kaa vot hasil karne ke liye nishad ummidavaar ko hi tikat detii rahi hai
 But their votes were divided
 pichley saal upachunaav main saajha ummidavaar hone ke kaaran nishad jati ke logon ke vot ek hi khate main gaye, jiskaa nateeja ye hua ki bijepi ko yahaan par haar mili
 Now that the SP-BSP alliance is once again betting on the Nishad candidate and there is a discussion that the BJP can also nominate Pravin Nishad from here, the election battle is expected to be interesting here
 yogi se mulaakaat ke pehle kya bole the sanjay nishadanishad party ke adhyaksh sanjay nishad ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki ham gathbandhan ke saath nahin he or nishad party swatantra rup se loksabhaa chunaav ladegi
 He said that our activists and core committee are angry with Akhilesh Yadav's attitude
 sanjay nishad ne kaha ki akhilesh yadav ne kaha tha ki vah hamaari party ke liye siton kaa elaan karenge
 But he did not even write the name of our party and a word in his posters
 sanjay nishad ne kaha ki ab ham swatantra hai or hamaare saamne sabhi vikalp khule hai
 The Nishad Party can fight alone as well and consider other options
 sapa pratyaashee kaa bada daawagorakhpur se samaajawaadee party ke pratyaashee rambhual nishad ne shanivaar ko daawa kiya ki nishad party pramukh sanjay nishad ne sapa-basapa-ralod gathbandhan isliye choda kyonki unhen bijepi se kathith rup se kaaphi paisa diya gaya he
 However, this claim of SP candidate was rejected by Sanjay Nishad's son Praveen Nishad
 sanjay nishad par kadaa prahaar karte hue sapa-basapa-ralod gathbandhan ke pratyaashee rambhual ne kaha ki sanjay nishad ne keval paise ke liye paala badla jo unhen bijepi dwaara diya gaya he
 He is a fraud and can never fight for the honor of the society
 gorakhpur ke vartmaan saansad praveen nishad ne kaha ki unhone (sapa) ne mujhe andhere main rakhaa, mujhase kaha ki chunaav kii taiyaari karo or usee samay rambhual nishad ko party kaa pratyaashee bana diya
 As far as Rambhual Nishad is accused of taking money from BJP, it is completely baseless
 unhone daawa kiya ki unki maang, ki nishad samudaay ko anusuchit jati shrenee main shaamil kiya jaae, ko pradesh sarkaar ne maan liya he

 Due to the rise in onion prices, the face of farmers coming to Pune Gultekdi market for a good onion crop is in awe these days
 kisaanon ke chehre khile hue dikhaai de rahe hai or ho bhi kyon naa, kisaanon kii maane to teen saal ke baad unke pyaaj kii fasal ko 40 rupaya prati kilo kaa bhav mil rahaa he
 On Monday, when 'aaj Tak' took stock of the price in the onion market, the traders and farmers were happy
 vyapaaree jadhav ke mutabik teen saal ke baad pyaaj ke liye achche din aae hai
 Earlier onion used to have very low prices
 graahakon ke najariye se dekhen to diwali ke turant baad pyaaj ke badhate daam unhen rulaa sakate hai kyonkipyaaj ke bhav aasmaan chunelge hai
 Due to the rise in prices, due to heavy rains in many western states including Maharashtra, onion came down in wholesale market
 ek ore bazaar main acha pyaaj kam aa rahaa he, vahi demand badhane sebhaav bhibad gaye hai
 On Sunday and Monday in Pune's Gultekdi market, onion has been priced at Rs 3500 to 4000 quintal i
e
 Rs 4000 for 100 kg onion and by the time it reaches Delhi and other big cities, it will be Rs 55 per kg
 aam taur par pune ke mandi main pyaaj ke 150 trek kaa vyapaar hota he, lekin barish ke kaaran pyaaj kii kam aavak ho rahi he
 60 to 70 trucks of good onions are coming, which are being priced at Rs 35 to 40 per kg
 vahiin halke quality vaale pyaaj ke 50 trek, jinke bhav 15 se 20 rupye prati kilo rah rahaa he
 Due to good prices, the reporter of Aaj Tak in Khushmandi met the farmer who got Rs 25 per kg for onion on October 10 and on October 24, he sold his onion at Rs 40 per kg
 kisaan kaa kahana he ki sabhi logon ko kisaanon kii khushi main shariq hona chahie
 Many times farmers have to sell onions at the rate of 2 to 5 rupees per kg, then they are also sad
 sarkaar naa kare hastakshep: vyaparibazar main vyapaariyon ne bataaya ki lagaataar ho rahi barish ke kaaran pyaaj kharaab hone se kisaan maal nahin bhej paa rahe hai or isi vajah se maal kam he, to bhav zyada hona laazmi he
 Traders in Pune Market say that the farmers had to bear the loss for the last three years
 teen varshon se pyaaj kisaanon ko rulaa rahaa tha
 This time, onion farmers have brought happiness, so the government should not interfere in this matter
 pakistan main hue chunaav main imran khan kii party pakistan taharik-e-insaaf (pitiai) sabase badi party banakar saamne ai he
 However PTI has to prove majority in National Assembly to form government
 spasht bahumat ke liye imran khan ko neshnal assembly ke kul sadasyon ke kam se kam 51 pratishat voton kii jarurat he

 However, so far no opposition party or members have left the opposition alliance to join PTI
 vipakshi gathbandhan jisamen pakistan muslim lig- navaj (PML-N), pakistan piples party (pipipi) or mutahida shaamil hai
 majlis-e-amal (MMA) has already decided to oppose Imran Khan and his supporting parties inside and outside Parliament

 Pakistan Muslim league-nawaz (PML-N) has 64 seats and Pakistan People's Party (PPP) has 43 seats
 haalanki, kuch choti partiyon ke gathbandhan seimran khanke liye pradhanmantri ke taur par chune jane ke kadam par khaas fark nahin padegaa lekin isse sansad main unke paas siten kam ho jaaengi
 Which can make it difficult for them to prove majority

 iske baad police ne mobile company se phone yuz karne vaale shaks kaa naam or pataa hasil kar liya
 Then the police raided the address and arrested the accused Sanjeet from there

 There was a major accident in Kushinagar in Uttar Pradesh on Thursday morning
 maanav rahit railway crossing par skool vine (tata magic) train kii chapet main aa gai thi
 The accident in which 13 children were killed
 haadase ke baadarel mantri piyush goyaldwara ucchstareey baithak bulaai gayi, jisamen deshbhar ke rail mandalon se maanav rahit railway crocingon ko mishan mod se hataane ko lekar charchaa kii gayi
 a ministry official said, "multidimensional strategic discussions were held at the meeting to remove unmanned railway crossings from across the country
 jinamein crocingon par rail mitra lagane, parivartit maarg banane, under-brij or over-brij banane jaise pahaluon par vichaar-vimarsh kiye gaye
 "also, the progress of the removal of unmanned cosings was said to be shared on the website through online medium so that public monitoring of the works can be done
" adhikari ne kaha ki 11 mandal kshetron se maanav rahit crossing hataane kaa lakshya sitambar 2018 tak kaa tay kiya gaya he, vahiin baaki ke 5 mandalon ke lakshya bhi jaldi tay kar liye jaaenge
 According to the officials of the Ministry, the removal of unmanned crossings is being done at the rate of two-thirds more than the average of 4 years ago
 ab puure desh main badi linon (braud gauge) par keval 3479 maanav rahit rail crossing rah gaye hai
 The accident occurred due to the negligence of the driver, however, the government was seen giving clarification on this recent incident and put the head of the negligent driver
 railway kaa kahana he ki, ye haadasa driver kii laaparvaahee kii vajah se hua he
 a gate friend was present at the crossing, who also gestured to the driver, but the gesture was not seen by the driver
 vahiin, ye bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki driver ne yearphone lagaaya tha, jis vajah se use train kii aawaaj nahin sunai thi
 Two ministers have changed, but the statement has not changed
 It is important to note that earlier such incidents have happened
 thik isse miltaa julata haadasa upi ke bhadohi main 2016 ke july maah main hua tha
 It is worth noting that even at that time, the Railways had given statements like this time giving clarification on the accident and had also made such promises
 railway kaa us vakt yahi bayaan tha jo aaj diya ja rahaa he
 In this way you can say that even after 2 years, 2 accidents and 2 Railway Ministers, the statements of Railways are same
 kya tha bhadohi haadase ke vakt bayaan?july 2016 main uttar pradesh ke bhadohimein bhi kushinagar jaisaa haadasa hua tha
 At that time, a school van collided with a high speed train at unmanned railway crossing, in which 8 children were killed
 iske baad tab ke rail mantri suresh prabhu ne twit kar ha tha ki, get mitra ne driver ko rokane kii koshish kii thi lekin driver ne uski chetavanee ko ansuna kiya, jis vajah se ye haadasa hua
 Gate Mitra was available at the time of accident but sadly van driver ignored his warning which resulted in this sad incident There are many similarities
 jaise donon hi maamalon main skool vine train kii chapet main ai he
 Not only this, in the initial investigation also, the same theory has been put forward in both cases
 jiske mutabik, maanav rahit phatak par get mitra maujuud tha
 Also, the driver had installed earphones, due to which he could not hear the sound of the train
 arvind kejariwal ne aadhyatmik guru shri shri ravishankar ke aaropon kaa jawaab diya he
 Kejriwal wrote via tweet, 'pujya Sri Sri Ravi Shankarji your feelings towards me have seriously hurt me
 main bhagwaan se prarthana karata hum ki main aapako yah yakeen dilaane main kaamyaab ho jaaoongaa ki main sirf desh ke liye kaam kar rahaa hum or meraa koi apana agenda nahin he
 Kejriwal gave his message through four consecutive tweets
 unhone likhaa, ‘main aapkaa bahut sammaan karata hum or karata rahoonga
 i hope that i will be able to overcome your malpractices against me everyday
 ’
 
 
 i have very deep respect for u and will continue to respect u always

 i am deeply hurt that u have written such strong sentiments against me
 
 
 
 
 
 — Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal)april 4, 2014shri shri ravishankar ne apane ek lekh ke jariye likhaa ki dilli main jo kuch bhi hua usase kejariwal kaa chupa agenda sabake saamne aa gaya he
 Read what Sri Sri Ravi Shankar wrote: When the Aam Aadmi Party emerged on the table of Indian politics, people felt that young and active leaders want to work towards improving the system of the country
 haalanki isaki shuruyaat gairraajnneetik andolan se hui thi
 i agree with Arvind Kejriwal on one point that politics has to be penetrated to clean up the corruption in politics
 isi kaaran, main hameshaa naksaliyon ko bullate chhod ballat kii ore jane kii vakaalat karata rahaa hum
 i was happy to see that during the last assembly elections in Jharkhand many young people participated
 aaj ki raajnneeti main aam aadmi ke liye in chunaavon main hissaa lene kaa matlab keval vot daalane tak simit rah gaya he
 The formation of this new party aroused hope in the minds of millions of people who are troubled by corruption and the influence of criminals in politics
 un kai logon ne ‘aap’ kii sadsyta lee jo behatar bharat dekhnaa chaahate hai
 This party made direct contact with the people and gave shocking results in the Delhi Assembly elections
 baad main ‘aap’ ne congress ke samarthan se sarkaar kaa gathan kiya
 People hoped that the new government would take action against the corrupt leaders
 agar ‘aap’ ki yah sarkaar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf sakht kadam uthaane ke baad girti to isaki saakh or shuddhta or bad jaati
 But the party was wrongly suggested to resign and leave Delhi and enter the politics of the country
 aisa kar kejariwal ne yah dikhaa diya ki wo anya rajanetaaon se alag nahin he, balki unka chupa hua raajnneetik agenda sabase saamne aa gaya
 Affordable popularity, self-contradiction, hyper-ambivalence and dictatorship have smeared the positive image of 'AAP' and many big names immediately broke away from the party, free of confusion
 ab kejariwal kehete hai ki wo is chunaav main khandit janadesh se santusht hai or agle do saalon main madhyavadhi chunaav hone kii baat kar rahe hai
 This shows his very insensitive attitude towards the economy and security of the country
 wo sirf chaar dinon ke liye gujarat gaye or bina sir pair vahaan ke vikaas kii aalochana karne lage
 i have snapped up the rumble of Gujarat
 1990 or 2000 ke shuruaati saalon tak saurashtra main koi ped kaa dikhnaa tak durlabh tha
 The drought here was so overwhelming that people often had to sell their cattle
 lekin aaj yahaan hariyaali he
 At that time, electricity was also barely available for two hours a day, but today almost all the villages here have electricity and water facilities and the per capita income has also increased considerably
 haalanki gujarat 100 fisadi bhrashtachar mukt nahin he lekin mujhe yah kehete hue katai sankoch nahin he ki yah us sthiti se bahut behatar he jaisaa pehle hua karata tha
 bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi, who was honest with his figures, accused Kejriwal of filming
 agar ‘aap’ ko logon ne desh kii raajnneeti ke liye chun liya or agar wo yahaan bhi vaisaa hi karte hai jaisaa ki unhone dilli main kiya he to yah desh ke liye aapadaa se kam nahin hoga
 When the country's condition is not good in terms of economy, then this risk cannot be taken
 hamen arthvyavastha ko patari par laane ke liye or vikaas ko badhaava dene ke liye centre main sthir sarkaar kii jarurat he
 In a hurry to jump into the politics of the country, AAP put the principles on which it was born
 ‘aap’ ko pehle dilli kii raajnneeti main khud ko sabit karnaa chahie tha phir desh ke duusare hisson main apni takat badhaane par jor dena chahie tha
 He should have gone to villages, contested panchayat and municipal elections
 use shashan ke liye apane cader ko majboot banane par kaam karnaa chahie tha
 This would force other political parties to rethink their strategy
 is prakaar ek majboot neenv se yah party desh ke liye ek vardaan sabit hoti
 But due to so many contradictions, AAP has lost its political reform agenda
 kejariwal ke haal kii harkaton se kabhi unke kattar sarmathak rahe logon main bhi rosh he
 He had come to give the country an option, but he made the country optionless
 mukhya nyaayadhish ranjan gogoi (ranjan Gogoi) ne mangalvaar ko kendriya anveshan beuro (CBI) ke ek kaarykram main sawaal kiya ki aisa kyon hota he ki jab kisi maamle kaa koi raajnneetik rang nahin hota, tab sibiai acha kaam karti he

 He said, "why is it that when a case has no political color, then the CBI does a good job
 iske vipareet sthiti ke kaaran vineet narayan banaam bharat sangh maamla saamne aayaa, jisamen ucchtam nyaayalay ne agency kii satyanishtha kii raksha karne ke liye spasht dishanirdesh tay kiye
 "at the same time, CBI Director Rishi Kumar Shukla said on Tuesday that whenever there is a demand for an impartial investigation in complicated cases, people demand a CBI inquiry
 unhone kaha ki agency ko sarkaar, nyaaypalika or logon kaa vishwaas hasil he
 Welcoming Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi to DP Kohli's 18th Memorial Lecture, he said that the CBI has always tried to discharge its responsibilities with dedication
 kumaar ne kaha ki ucchtam nyaayalay or ucch nyaayalay ne sibiai kii madad karne or maarg dikhaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai he

 However, it is understood that Dhoni asked the selection committee not to consider his name
 maahi ke phens ke liye yah bada jhatka he, kyonki vah unhen (dhoni ko) ek baar phir se captaini karte hue dekhnaa chaahate the
 Although Dhoni took command of Jharkhand in the Vijay Hazare Trophy last year
 jharkhand kii ore se saurabh tiwari, ishank jaggi, viraat singh or ishan kishan jaise khilaadi maidan par utrenge
 Currently, Team India is on South Africa tour and Dhoni does not play Test, so he is spending more and more time with his family

 a petition was filed in the Delhi High Court on 15 January against the abolition of management quota in nursery admissions of the Delhi government
 somvaar ko maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne kaha ki dilli sarkaar smoking, non-veg jaisi category to khatm kar sakati he lekin skulon kii autonomi ko vah kaise chin sakati he
 On the next hearing 28, in the question asked on the government schools , the High Court has asked the Delhi government to submit an affidavit by January 5
 agali sunwaayee 28 janvari ko hogi
 Till then the process will continue as it is
 court ke aadesh ke baad hi saaf hoga ki 62 category main se koun-si rahengi or koun si hataai jaaengi
 At the same time, the court questioned the government as to what the government was doing to improve government schools
 kya sirf privet skulon par niyantran hi sarkaar ke agenda main he? vahiin privet skulon ne court me kaha kii dilli sarkaar kaa skulon kaa kota khatm karne kaa aadesh hai court ke jajment ke hi khilaaf he
 The High Court had earlier said, the schools will decide their own rules
 Some schools said that there may be some schools that are making categories for government admission such as smoking, non-veg etc
 lekin ve minurity skool hai or unka pratishat bahut kam he
 The government is shaking all the schools with the same wood
 management kota khatm karne kaa dilli sarkaar kaa yah aadesh 2013 main die gaye LG ke aadesh kii hi carbon copy he, jis par hai court khud aadesh de chukaa he ki sahaayta praapt na karne vaale privet skool khud apane niyam tay karenge
 At the same time, the Ganguly Committee also recommended that it is necessary to have private school autonomy as it will further promote good private schools and quality education
 nahin he cote ke durupyog kaa sabutasarkaar ne daawa kiya he ki management kota kaa skool durupyog karte hai lekin 2007 ke notification ke baad se apane is aarope ko sabit karne ke liye sarkaar ke paas koi saboot yaa cese nahin he
 If a school still makes a mess then the government has a law to take action against it
 EWS category main to lottery nikaali ja sakati he lekin baaki category main ise lagu karnaa vyavhaarik nahin he
 This kind of education cannot be taken away from parents, what kind of education they want to give to their children, in which school they want admission
 nijee skulon ke liye raahat kii batgaiyr sahaayta praapt nijee skulon ke pravaktaa prabhaash raman ne kaha ki court ne unki samasyaayein samajhi hai or yah faisla unke liye raahat lekar aayaa he
 Advocate Kamal Gupta, who is advocating for the schools, said that the main issue of our fight is the autonomy of schools
 vahiin court ne yah savaala bhi uthaaya he ki sarkari skulon par sarkaar dhyaan kyon nahin de rahi he
 With the imposition of GST without any hiccups and a boost in the Indian economy, foreign portfolio investors (fpis) have invested around Rs 11,000 crore in the country's capital market in the first two weeks of this month

 However, he said that the recent developments on the upcoming global macroeconomic data suggest an improvement in the situation in some developing countries which may pose a hindrance for the Indian market as fpis may change their investment destination

 isamen koi andeh nahin ki mandiron main daan karnaa ishwar or mandir ke prati param aasthaa kaa maamla he
 In almost all the major temples of the country, devotees pour billions of rupees of cash and jewelery into the donation box, of which gold and silver are the main ones
 lekin jaraa kalpana kijiye ki desh ke mandiron main kitne ton sona hoga? According to an estimate, there are about seven tonnes of gold and 30 tonnes of silver in the treasury of Tirupati Balaji temple located in Tirumala, Andhra Pradesh, which is considered the richest temple in the country
 is swarna-rajat bhandar main shraddhalu din-pratidin vruddhi hi karte ja rahe hai
 Significantly, the gold lying in temples is not used in the economy of the country
 isiilie sarkaar is jamaa sone ko arthvyavastha main waapas laane ke liye ab protsaahan de rahi he
 The result of this encouragement is that recently the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam Trust (tirumal Tirupathi Devasthanams - TTD) of Tirupati temple has 1 in Punjab National Bank
 3 ton sona jamaa kiya he
 The trust of the temple has also kept about one and a half ton gold in Indian Overseas Bank
 iske badale main mandir ko acha-khaasaa byaaz praapt hoga
 It is reported that the trusts of Sai Temple at Shirdi in Maharashtra and Srisiddhivinayak Temple in Mumbai have also agreed to avail the scheme
 shrisiddhivinayak mandir trust is yojana ke tahat lagbhag 45 kilo sona jamaa karegaa
 Many other temples in this country are also thinking of taking advantage of this scheme

 The dream that the Aam Aadmi Party had given to the people of Delhi before the election to give free wi-fi is going to remain the dream as before
 free vaai faai philhal hakeekat banataa najar nahin aa rahaa he
 RTI disclosed on wi-fi There is a big disclosure from RTI on Kejriwal government's big promise of free wi-fi
 sarkaar bhale hi disambar tak purvi dilli main free vaai faai dene kaa daawa kar rahi ho, lekin is vaade kii hakeekat ye he ki sarkaar banane ke dedh saal bhikejariwal sarkaarko ye bhi nahi pataa ki dilli waalon ko vaai faai kaise diya jaae
 The shocking reply came from the Information Technology Department of the Delhi government that no plan for free wi-fi has been made so far
 free wifi kii aas main dilli ke yuva mukesh ne artiai lagaai or poocha ki1
 What is the government's plan for free wi-fi and what is the latest status of the scheme? 2
 14 farvari se lekar 4 june 2015 tak dilli ke kitne ilaakon main free vaai faai kii suvidha di ja chuki he?3
 If free wi-fi is being provided, then who is the company providing wi-fi? 4
 free vaai faai yojana main logon ko kitna kitna data istemaal ke liye diya jayega?is tarah ke kul 12 sawaal artiai main puche gaye
 It is worth noting that the responsibility of providing free wi-fi is with the Information Technology Department of the government and it has also been made the nodal agency
 dilachasp ye he ki 25 june ko dilli dialog kamishan ke ashish khetaan ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki purvi dilli main disambar tak wi fi denge or 29 june ko sarkari jawaab aata he ki ab tak is babat use koi jaankaree nahin he
 The government was not aware of its plan
 The answers to questions asked in RTI were shocking
 javaabon ne free vaai faai par kejariwal sarkaar ke daavon or taiyaariyon kii pole khol kar rakh di
 Regarding the Wi Fi plan, it was replied that the plan is still being prepared
 soochna takanic vibhaag ko yojana se jude sarkaar ke prastaav kaa intjaar he
 That is, it is clear from this answer that even after one and a half years, except Delhiites, the Delhi government itself has no access to free wi-fi

 These people just look at themselves in the mirror all day and then ask why we need to think about the country when we have all the facilities

 a court in Himachal Pradesh's Aman Kachroo ragging case on Thursday convicted four senior medical students for culpable homicide and sentenced them to four years imprisonment
 saath hi adaalat ne chaaron doshi chaatro par 10-10 hajaar rupee kaa jurmaana bhi laagaya he

 vahiin intervyuu dene kaa sahi tarika bhi aapako ek badhiya naukari dilaa saktaa he
 According to media reports, Rachel Bite, Chief People Officer at a recruiting software company, has said that often candidates give such cheats while giving interviews, due to which they lose jobs
 unhone kaha ki vah appal or intuit main recruiter or echaar agjicutive rah chukin hai
 Where he interviewed more than 6,000 people
 jaane kya hai wo galtiyaan
 
 
 
 narmi se pesh naa anarechal bite ne kahaan ki intervyuu ke dauraan ummidavaar kaa bihaviour naram nahin hota
 He said that after the phone interview, a candidate was called to the breakfast for the second round
 lekin jis tarah usne hotel ke staff ke saath bihev kiya usase saaf pataa chal gaya ki vah insaan kaisaa he
 He says that whenever a candidate comes for an interview, he should behave softly
 aapke bure bartaav se naukari to nahin milegi saath hi aapaki image par bhiswalkhade ho sakate hai
 Do not ask questions
 They said that you are going to interview for a job in a new company, and if you do not ask any questions related to the company, then it also has an incorrect impression
 recruiter ko lagata he ki aap naukari ko lekarsiriasanheen he or nai company ke bare main kuch nahin jaanate
 He says that the candidate in the company who is going to give interview, do research about it
 taaki aap recruiter se company se sambandhit sawaal- jawaab kar saken
 One thing to always keep in mind that whenever you ask an awkward and logical question, no one will consider you stupid
 upi main yogi adityanath ke vande maataram ke mantra ke kai siyaasi myne nikaale ja rahe hai
 Opponents allege that this is only a tool of bjp's saffron agenda
 lekin itihaas ko khangaalen to pataa chalata he ki congress ne parhez kiya to bijepi ne vande maataram lapak liya
 In such an environment, when the debate on whether Vande Mataram song is necessary or not, it is very important to know what Mahatma Gandhi's thinking was about Vande Mataram
 aazaadee se thik pehle guwahati main ek prarthana sabha ke dauraan mahatma gandhi ne vande maataram ko kya ahmiyat di thi
 In fact, Jovande Mataram was the power bank of patriotism in the battle of independence, the same Vande Mataram became a symbol of a different political raga in time after independence
 alam ye rahaa ki samvidhan main vande maataram ko raashtragan jaisaa sammaan or darja die jane ke praavdhaan ke baavjood desh kaa raashtragit hi desh kii sansad se dur ho gaya
 When parties like BJP and Shiv Sena made arrows of their quiver, the distance from its other political ideologies increased
 raajnneeti kaa rang aisa ghulaa ki hindu rashtrawaad kii baat karne waalon ke liye to vande maataram bhmavakya ban gaya
 But it became equally difficult for others to adopt it
 duusari ore aazaadee kii ladaai ke vakt uthe vivaad ne vande maataram kaa peechha aazaadee ke baad bhi nahin choda
 There were still such things as prohibiting bowing of head in front of anyone other than Islam, God and still stand in front of it equally
 ramamandir or uniform civil code kii baat karte-karte bijepi ne jab lambey arase baad desh ke sabase bade soobe main prachand bahumat se sarkaar banaai to virodhiyon kii najar main vande maataram ke myne bhi utane hi prachand ho gaye
 Some people suspect that an attempt is being made to change the state and the fabric of the country through Vande Mataram
 lekin vande maataram ke in siyaasi myanon ke khilaaf bijepi ke andar se hi aawaaj uthne lagi he
 It is evident that the words of Vande Mataram of Mahatma Gandhi are the same even today
 lekin iske myne vakt or siyasat ke saath badalte ja rahe hai
 If you believe that happiness cannot be bought with wealth, then you need to think again because a new study has claimed that happiness can be bought to a certain extent but with money
 ‘procedings of di neshnal academy of sciensej’ kii ek report ke mutabik, princeton uniwarsity ke shodhakartaaon ne paaya he ki 75,000 dollar tak kii aamadani hone se logon main anand or santushti kaa ahsaas bhi badhata he

 For their study, the researchers conducted a survey with 1,000 people about their income and happiness levels
