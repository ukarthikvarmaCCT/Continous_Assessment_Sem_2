 sarkaar ne kaha ki rashtramandal khelon se pehle aisa koi vishesh abhiyaan prastaavit nahin he jiske tahat mahatvapurn chauraahon se bhikhaariyon or pheriwaalon ko hataane ke liye kadam uthaaye jaayenge
 Minister of State for Home Mullappally Ramachandran told the Rajya Sabha that the Delhi Police did not have a proposal under which action would be taken to remove beggars and hawkers from South Delhi especially at the Sirifort Sports Complex, Panchsheel intersection and other intersections
 unhone bataaya ki rashtramandal khelon se pehle mahatvapurn chauraahon par bhikhaariyon or pheriwaalon ke khilaaf abhiyaan shuru karne kaa koi prastaav nahin he
 Ramachandran said that the local police keep an eye on the intersections to remove beggars or unauthorized hawkers from any area

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has opposed the presence of leaders in sports organizations and advocated handing it over to professionals
 unhone twitor par kaha ki rajanetaaon ko khel se judi sansthaaon main nahin hona chahie
 There shud be no politician in any sports body
 Let sports be handled by professionals
 - Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) December 23, 2015 Kejriwal said, 'it is better to hand over to sports professionals and run it there

 AAP activists also demonstrated against Jaitley on Wednesday
 iske pehle police ne pradarshan kar rahe AAP samarthakon ko hiraasat main liya tha
 On the allegations being made by the AAP, 'kejriwal came down on abuses instead of replying', Union Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said that the DDCA case has already been investigated and nothing wrong has been found so far, but then Arvind Kejriwal not only abused Jaitley, but also his family
 unhone kaha, 'arvind kejariwal raajnneeti se bhrashtachar ko mitaane kii baat to karte hai lekin duusari ore bhrasht logon ko apane kareeb rakhte hai
 Instead of answering these questions, he came down to the language of abusive language
 ''aarope lagane vaale jetali ko jaanate nahin'kendriya mantri jitendra singh nekejariwal par nishanasadhate hue kaha, 'jo bhi log arun jetali par sawaal uthaa rahe hai ve unke vyaktitv se parichit nahin he
 The people making the allegations are unintelligent
 jetali kii khubiyaan unhen pataa hi nahin hai
 'kejriwal thundered in the assembly
 One day before, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal lashed out at Prime Minister Modi in the assembly
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri ke saath koi arvind kejariwal kaa naam letaa he to unka khun khul jaataa he
 Kejriwal lashed out at PM Modi and said, "earlier the Prime Minister's slogan was that neither will i eat nor will i allow to eat, but now his slogan is that neither will work, nor will you allow
" ' unhone sibiai ke chaape ke liye pradhanmantri modi se istife kii maang tak kar daali
 Kejriwal said that the Prime Minister wants to scare the CBI, but we are not afraid
 pradhanmantri ne rong number dial kar diya he, lekin wo hamen daraa nahin paaenge
 Before the special session of the Assembly was called, the Delhi government on Tuesday proposed to set up a commission to investigate the alleged corruption in Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA)
 upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne prastaav pesh karte hue kaha ki didisie main saraasar aniyamitata hui he
 He said that the Delhi Legislative Assembly is concerned about the huge corruption in this cricketing institution
 dilli sarkaar ne mangalvaar ko didisie main aniyamittaaon or pichley hafte dilli sachivalay main maare gaye sibiai ke chaape jaise muddon par charchaa karne ke liye vidhansabha kaa vishesh satr bulaayaa tha
 The AAP accused Jaitley that the common man party accused Arun Jaitley that 24 crore was given to build a new stadium under his chairmanship, but 114 crore was spent in it
 to phir 90 karod kahaan gaye
 It was also alleged that Arun Jaitley gave contracts to his close ones and those companies which never worked in DDCA have also been paid
 AAP ne jetali se yah sawaal bhi kiya ki 2006 main unki ghoshit sampatti 23
 86 crores, which increased six times to 120 crores in 2012? rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog ne bhopal gas traasadee ke peediton par dawaaon ke kathith pareekshan ke aaropon par centre or madhyapradesh sarkaar ko notice jari kiya he
 a complaint said that the Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Center is conducting drug tests on the victims of the 1984 gas tragedy, killing many people
 is shikaayat ko dekhte hue notice jari kiya gaya he
 The commission said the allegedly multi-specialty hospital, which was set up to treat gas victims, is testing drugs on those people
 jin 279 marijon par pareekshan kiya gaya, unamem se 215 gas peedit hai

 ) In the Kashmir Valley, terrorists are now kidnapping such youths, whom they suspect are informants for the army
 aatankiyon ne 5 yuvakon kaa apharan kar liya jisamen se 1 kii hatya kar di gai
 In the Kashmir Valley's Shopian district this afternoon, militants kidnapped three youths and killed one youth and released two
 shaam hote-hote shopiyaan ke hi me mandir ilaake se or do yuvakon kaa apharan aatankiyon ne kiya
 According to Jammu and Kashmir Police, the slain youth has been identified as 19-year-old Huzaif Ashraf, a resident of Kulgam
 anya do yuvakon faruk or bilal ko aatankiyon ne chhod diya he lekin shaam hote-hote sufian kii hi me mandir ilaake se do or yuvaaon kaa apharan kiya gaya
 On Friday, the militants kidnapped Nadeem, a resident of Jam Nagri in Shopian district, and his body was recovered from Pulwama district on Friday morning
 aatanki sanghathan hijbul mujahidin ne uske baad ek video bhi jari kiya tha jisamen nadeem ne sena ke liye mukhabiri karne kii baat maani thi or do aatankiyon ko sena ke oparation main maravane kii baat boli thi
 Police have recovered 48 quintal explosives (ammonium nitrate) from Dehri Nagar police station area of rohtas district of Bihar in the early hours of Thursday
 is maamle main ek vyakti ko giraftaar bhi kiya gaya he
 Rohtas Superintendent of Police Vikas Varman said that the police had received secret information that a large consignment of explosives was going to arrive in Gopibigha area of dehri
 isi soochna ke adhaar par police ne chhapemari kar ek tractor par 96 boron main rakhe kareeb 48 kvatal visphotak baraamad kiya
 He said that a person has been arrested in this case, who is being questioned
 varman ke mutabik police is baat kii jaanch kar rahi he ki ukt visphotak avaidh khanan ke liye istemaal kiya janaa tha yaa ise naksaliyon ke paas pahunchaaya janaa tha
 Police are also trying to find out from where the explosive was brought
 nitish kumaar kabhi bhi phir se bihar ke mukhyamantri ban sakate hai
 It depends on Nitish Kumar when he again takes over the throne of Bihar
 party ke rashtriya adhyaksh sharad yadav ne iske liye hari jhandi de di he
 Also, RJD President Lalu Prasad has no objection to Nitish Kumar becoming the Chief Minister again
 lalu prasad kaa kahana unki party kaa samarthan janata dal(you) kii sarkaar ko he, na ki kisi mukhyamantri ko
 If Nitish Kumar becomes the Chief Minister then he has no problem
 ab din samay nitish kumaar ko tay karnaa he ki wo kab mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lete hai
 But the question is when, how and under what circumstances should Jitanram Manjhi be removed
 jeethanram maanjhi ko hataane ke do tareeke hai, yaa to unase prem se samajhakar istipha liya jaae yaa phir unhen jabardastee hataaya jaae
 The party may be at a disadvantage in the removal of coercion, as BJP stands to save Jitan Ram Manjhi
 vah isliye ki jab tak jeethanram maanjhi mukhyamantri rahenge, bijepi ko bihar main iskaa laabh miltaa rahegaa
 BJP will never want Nitish Kumar to take over Bihar again in place of Jitan Ram Manjhi, as Nitish Kumar is known for 'good governance'
 aise main bijepi ko bihar main mudde talashne main dikkat ho sakati he
 On the other hand, Jitan Ram Manjhi will be ready to resign from the conversation with Prem, it is also difficult to say, because many ministers and mlas are very fond of him as Chief Minister
 isliye nahin ki jeethanram maanjhi bihar ko aage lekar ja rahe hai, balki isliye ki jo aazaadee unhen maanjhi ke rahete mil rahi he, wo nitish kumaar ke kaarykaal main nahin milegi
 In such a situation, the party needs to be very careful
 haalanki adhiktar mantri or vidhayak nitish kumaar ke samarthan main hai
 Nitish Kumar has been meeting mlas and leaders of different areas daily at his residence to get their feedback

 Singh, World Power Party, 30 NOTA, 465 desh ke namchin sansthaanon main ek jawaharlal nehru uniwarsity ke adhyaksh pad par chune jane ke baad kanhaiya ko lekar bihar ke begusarai jile main swaagat or garvile apnaapan kaa ehsaas upja or failaa tha
 One of the largest villages in the district is Kanhaiya's house in Masandpur Tola of Bihat
 taaja vivaad par gaanv or jile ke log kanhaiya ko lekar pehle naaraaz or ab asamanjas main fanse mahasoos kar rahe hai
 After the controversy, the concern of the parents increased from Bihar, which is considered to be a backward state of the country, is cursed for millions of students every year
 peshewar or ucch shiksha ke saath hi karier ke duusare vikalpon ke liye naujavaanon kaa desh kii rajdhani dilli or anya mahanagaron kii ore rukh karnaa nai baat nahin he
 Politically, the doubts of the minds of the students of these students at Delhi's extreme activism are not hidden from anyone
 jeenyu maamle ke baad abhibhavakon kaa dar is bare main or bad gaya he
 Students talking to their home are able to feel it clean
 romantic raajnneeti ke haalia ubhaar kaa fori asarkanhaiya kii tarah hi usase pehle or baad main begusarai se badi sankhya main noujvaan oonche sapanom ke saath dilli aate rahe hai
 They all read, earn, miss home and go politically - unknowingly - their strong opinions
 jeenyu main deshadrohi narebaaji, kanhaiya kii giraftaar, tihaad main 21 din kii kaid, peshi ke dauraan patiala house court campus main marpet, sashart jamaanat or baad memraajnneetik stantse un sabaki soch par asar padaa he
 There are some who are influenced by the recent emergence of romantic politics, and there are some who are completely contrary to it
 kanhaiya ke bhaashan ko koi atirikt ank nahinsedishan ko deshadroh yaa rajdroh kuch bhi kah lijie
 An opinion on Kanhaiya does not appear to be formed, despite avoiding any comment about the case under consideration in the court
 begusarai main na to cese ke saamne aate hi kanhaiya ko turant doshi maan liya gaya tha or na hi use jamaanat mil jane ke baad begunaah maanane kii jaldbaaji kii gai
 There is no one in Begusarai in favor of giving extra points to Kanhaiya for talking about the right to dissent, the verbal attack on the central government and Narendra Modi, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad
 jile ke liye yah koi nai baat nahin
 History of changing the Left's Left: Begusarai district was given several names in political discussions Leningrad of Bihar, Mini Moscow and the laboratory of the Left, etc
 ek daur tha jab jile main vidhansabha kii saaton seat par vampanthi dalon ke pratinidhi chune gaye the
 Independents from these parties also went ahead by winning the election
 inhen vampanthi dalon se log congress, bijepi, jediu, argedy, algepi dalon main bhi gaye
 Two leftist leaders in the BJP also became mlas, ministers and mps
 panchayat or nagar nikaay chunaavon main bhi vampanth kii khaas dhamak dikhti rahi
 Political mileage of the dispute was not found
 Until these days, a lot of water has flowed from rivers like Ganga, Budhi Gandak, Chandrabhaga, Balan, passing through Begusarai
 vampanth kii thodi-bahut takat ab yahaan reliyon main dikhti he
 This is discussed in view of mathematical data in elections
 vampanthi chaatr sanghathanon se nikle kai chaatr netaaon ne duusare raajnneetik dalon main apana samaayojan kar liya he
 The elderly people who remain like the voice of the Left, listen to them in family terms, but do not listen to them
 aise halaat main kanhaiya ko pesh karne kii ranneeti ko vidhansabha chunaav main aajamaaya gaya tha
 It did not matter on the outcome
 phir se is ghatana ke sahare raajnneetik milage lene kii vampanthi dalon kii koshish feeki hi rahi
 After the arrest of Kanhaiya, the attack on him and the bail, there is a difference of opinion among the people coming from the Left parties
 vampanth main bihat gaanv kaa he raubajis gaanv main kanhaiya kaa ghar he
 That village has been the leftist most influential village in Behat district
 rajya ke pehle urja mantri or senior congressi netaa rahe ramcharitra singh ke bete chandrashekhar singh ne vampanth kii raah pakad lee thi
 So far Suryanarayan Singh alias Suraj Babu of the neighboring village Madhurapur has not been forgotten
 jamaanat ke baad kanhaiya ke jeenyu main bhaashan kii tarif kar rahe logon ne bihat ke hi commered chandeshwari prasad singh ko yakeenan nahin suna hoga
 His speech in the local dialect also connected ideological opponents with ease
 gaanv main adhiktar saanskrithik kaaryakramon ke aayojan main kathith vamapanthiyon kii bhoomika rahati he
 People of these parties in Delhi can dismiss those events as communal
 raajnneeti kaa shikaar na ho jaae kanhaiyakanhaiya ko lekar charchaaon kii jitani rassakashi rajdhani main dikh rahi he utani begusarai jile main yaa vahaan se aane vaale chaatro main nahin he
 Wherever the people of the district are living, no one is hurrying about the incident
 kanhaiya ko vipaksh kii aawaaj kii tarah gloriphay karne se bhi begusarai kaa noujvaan sahamat nahin he
 Experts who are sympathetic to Kanhaiya are afraid that he might fall prey to big crocodile politicians
 kanhaiya kii maa ne bhi media ko die bayanon main is dar kii charchaa kii he
 The fear of miscarriage of Kanhaiya's prospects remains, even after many good coincidences such as fear-mongering, ideological training, phd studies and a new age, sparked by the interest of many parties
 jis tarah se yechuri ne use pashchim bengal main sipiem kaa star prachaarak bataa diya
 Many parties including JDU, AAP, Congress have shown interest in Kanhaiya
 sipiai kii chaatr ikai se aanevaale kanhaiya ke liye gambhirtha se sochane kaa vakt he
 Separation from Kanhaiya increased with sympathy Afzal Guru, who has benefited from becoming the hashtag of Kanhaiya with words like Mahishasur, independence, constitution, law, justice process, government, doubt has increased for Begusarai
 desh ko sahityakar, rajaneta, udyogpati, kalakaar, vichaarak, patrkaar, shikshavid jaise jivan ke vibhinn kshetron main dhurandhar dene vaale jile ke is mahatvakankshi noujvaan ko lekar logon main kaayam algaav ke bhav kii vajah gahare research kaa vishay he
 Kanhaiya has tried to address everyone in his more things
 khud ko nahin
 He has not got time for himself after returning from jail
 uskesapaas jakadti mukhyadhara kii raajnneetisochane kaa vakt degi bhi yaa nahin
 This is the concern of Begusarai and the people associated with it
 philhal kanhaiya kii badi chintaaon main yah shaamil nahin dikhataa
 It remains intact, the son of the incomplete son, born in Simaria in Begusarai district and later called Rashtrapati Ram Ramdhari Singh Dinkar, wrote in a letter to Banarsidas Chaturvedi on August 4, 1955, "I have been a victim of three concerns

 ) With the end of Bihar elections, people's eyes are now fixed on who forms the government in the last state
 donon bade gathbandhan apni-apni jeet ke daawey kar rahe hai
 On the other hand, the results of various exit polls are coming out differently, which makes it difficult to estimate the result accurately
 aise main ek sawaal uthta he ki agar bihar main NDA ko jeet milti he, to isseefn narendra modi ke 'siyaasi kad'or NDA kii ranneeti par kya asar padegaa? aage inhen baton par charchaa kii gai he
 1
 kamyaabi kaa doosraa naam narendra modi!agar bihar main NDA sarkaar banane main safal hota he, to desh ke raajnneetik falak par narendra modi kaa naam or bada ho jayega
 Bihar's victory will prove to be another milestone for Modi after the spectacular success in the Lok Sabha elections
 NDA ne chunaav narendra modi kaa naam aage rakhkar ladaa he, isliye jeet kaa sehara unke hi sir par baandha janaa tay he
 2
 upi chunaav main jeet kii sambhaavna badhegidusraa bada asar yah hoga ki aage jin-jin pradeshon main chunaav hona he, vahaan NDA ke paksh main lahar chalegi yaa kam se kam lahar 'paidaa karne' kii koshish kii jaaegi
 In such a situation, it can be said that the chances of victory of BJP and NDA in the 2017 assembly elections in UP will increase
 3
 The frustration of the opposition will increase and Bihar and UP are two states on whose axis the politics of the entire country revolves
 NDA bihar ke baad agar upi main apni sambhaavnaaen badha letaa he, to vipaksh puri tarah hataash ho jayega
 a new phase of 'ideological churn' can begin in the marginalized Congress
 JDU or RJD kaa dabadabaa kam hone kii surat main anya kshetreey partiyon kaa bhi manobal giregaa
 4
 modi-shah kii jodi or majboot hogibihar main kamyaabi milane par narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii jodi 'superhit' qaraar de di jaaegi
 The pair's hold on the government and the party will become stronger than before
 5
 The focus on 'cow' will increase in the election campaign, though every small and big party in Bihar has been claiming to contest on the issue of development, but the reality is that many other issues have dominated in the election apart from development
 gaay-bachade se lekar tantra-mantra or sarson tak prachaar main chhaae rahe
 In such a situation, if Modi wins, the discussion on 'cow' will be further intensified in the coming elections

 All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) President and MP Asaduddin Owaisi said that BJP should not see this country only through the prism of Hindutva
 unhone kaha ki hindustan kii khubsuurati iskaa bahulwaad, dharmanirpekshata or vibhinnata he jise bijepi khatm karnaa chaahati he
 He accused the BJP of doing politics of religious hysteria under the pretext of uniform civil code
 hindu avibhajit parivaar kanoon ko pehle badla jaesantakabeernagar ke daure par aae ovaisi ne kaha ki vitt mantri arun jetali ne ek lekh main likhaa he ki desh main har kanoon ko samvidhan ke anusaar hona chahie
 Owaisi said that if it is to be done, then only include the Muslims in the tax exemption provided to Hindus under the Hindu Undivided Family
 ovaisike mutabik ye kanoon 1952 se lagu he or samvidhan ke anuchhed 14,21 or 25 kaa ulanghan karata he
 Owaisi has demanded that this law be changed first
 ovaisi ne goa main shaadiyon kaa hawala bhi diya
 He said that religious law applies to whoever marries in Goa
 isai shaadi karata he to carch kaa kanoon lagu hota he
 In the same way if Hindu gets married then Hindu customs apply to him
 ovaisike mutabik goa main kuch jagah bahuvivaah kii bhi ijaajat he
 Owaisi challenged the BJP and said that it is his government there, first he should say that he will abolish the marriage law in Goa
 unhone dayabhaga or mitakshra skool of thots kaa bhi hawala diya
 In which there is a system of property sharing
 saath hi unhone krishi bhoomi uttaradhikaar kii visangati ko bhi ginaya
 To hide the failures, bjp's agenda agenda, Owaisi said that the BJP has failed in every case in the last two and a half years
 ab wo chaahe wo rojgaar paidaa karne kii baat ho yaa keemten kam karne kii
 According to Owaisi, the BJP is on a divisive agenda to conceal its failure to polarize votes
 AIMIM puri tarah sena ke sathsargical strike par bijepi ke raajnneeti karne sambandhi sawaal par ovaisi ne kaha, 'hamaari party puri tarah sena ke saath he
 Our party does not tolerate terrorism, whether it crosses the border or inside
 aatankwaad ke khilaaf puure mulk ko ekajute hokar kaam karnaa chahie
 Our country has a democratic system and the military functions under political leadership
 ' sargical strike ko lekar ovaisi ne kaha ki is par wo zyada kuch nahin kahenge
 He also took the name of the mobile of a particular brand and said in a funny tone that it is going to burn when kept in the pocket
 ovaisi ne kaha ki isliye aisa koi sawaal unase naa kiya jaae
 On the fight of the Samajwadi Party of Kushpu on the battle of the Samajwadi clan, Owaisi said that the nephew is not trusting his uncle, the son is not trusting his father
 isi tarah baap ko bete par vishwaas nahin he, chachaa bhattije se naaraaz he
 Owaisi alleged that the state was being divided in this battle of clan
 ovaisi ne kaha ki mujffarnagar, bijanour, or dadri maamle main abhi tak samaajawaadee sarkaar insaaf nahin kar pai
 Also, this government has failed on the issue of 18% reservation for Muslims

 ye chunaav tay karegaa ki pakistan kaa aglaa pradhanmantri koun hoga? vaise is pad ke liye ek naam kukhyat aatanki hafiz said kaa bhi aa rahaa he
 But will the wish of this PM in venturing Pakistan be fulfilled? Can Hafiz Saeed really become the Prime Minister of Pakistan
 jiske sir par america ne 1 karod dollar ke inaam kaa elaan kar rakhaa he, jo hindustan kaa sabase bada gunahagaar or sanyukt raashtra sangh kaa ghoshit antarrashtriya aatankwaadi he or jisaki party ko khud pakistani chunaav ayog ne chunaav ladane ke kaabil nahin samajha, ab usihafiz saidane pichley darvaaze se pakistan kaa pradhanmantri banane kaa jugad dhund liya he
 Yes, despite all restrictions and objections, Hafiz Saeed has made full preparations to field his candidates in the general election of Pakistan on July 25
 ab chunki paak chunaav ayog ne hafiz said kii party ko siyaasi party kaa darja dene se inkaar kar diya he
 So Hafiz has tried a second tactic to take over the power of Pakistan
 usne aisi siyaasi party kaa daaman thaamne kii saazish rachi he, jo chunaav ayog se to manyata praapt hai magar hai haashie par
 According to the news, the name of the party which Hafiz Saeed has chosen for this work is - Allahu Akbar Tehreek
 ye party chunaav ayog main pehle se hi registerd he
 It is a different matter that this party has been alive only on paper for a long time
 chunaavon main isaki bhagidaari naa ke baraabar hi he
 But now the Chief of the jamaat-ud-dawa is not only looking to rejuvenate this party, but is also going to field his candidates under the banner and mark of this party
 hafiz said jis allahu akbar taharik party se pakistan ke aam chunaav main kismat aazamaane ja rahaa he
 His election mark is the chair

 There are many such parties recognized by the Election Commission, which are arranged just before the election so that if any party faces any problem, then help can be sought from it
 milli muslim lig is sambandh main jald hi aupchaarik ghoshnaa karegaa
 The election symbol of allah-u-akbar Tehreek is 'chair' and the JUD / Allahu Akbar Tehreek candidates will use the 'chair' election symbol across the country
 haalanki, hafiz said ne khud nirdaleey chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 However, most of the close associates of Hafiz Saeed, who are contesting elections and forming a government in Pakistan, are currently under house arrest in Lahore
 inamen khud hafiz said, uske chaar sahyogi abdulla ubaid, malik jafar ikbaal, abdul rahamaan aabid or kaaji casif hossain shaamil he
 Those who have been placed under house arrest since January 20 this year
 itnaa hi nahin hafiz kii political party ke alaava uske sanghathan jamaat ud daawa ko america ne june 2014 se hi aatanki sanghathan ghoshit kar rakhaa he
 The US has also announced a prize of 10 million US dollars on Hafiz
 lekin agar hafiz said pakistan main aam chunaav jeetta he to ye inami aatanki pakistan kaa prime ministar ban jayega
 What will happen next is something to think about

 The reason is clear that the state government does not want to get angry with the Jain society, however to avoid this controversy, it has also decided to seek opinion from the central government, calling it a national issue

 It has two in plain clothes and one is beating a woman
 mahila dwaara sach nahin bataane ke kaaran peeta ja rahaa he
 After listening to the video, it is known that the woman has given a phone number, but the police are not sure about it
 yah video pichley saal oktober kaa he
 The police team had received information that a couple was doing illegal work in the park
 iske baad police maukey par pahunchati he jisamen ladkaa bhaag nikalne main kaamyaab ho jaataa he, lekin mahila ko pulisavaale pakad lete hai

 shahenshaah box offis par kabje kii ladaai main apana haq to dur, astitv ke liye jujhataa najar aa rahaa he
 The idea of chhoti Nawab is unable to give anything other than a sad ending at the ticket window
 himmatwala bhi acshan ke pher main funskar pani maangata najar aa rahaa he jabaki serial kisar se serial heater kaa khitaab paane vaala sitara ek adad hit ke liye taras rahaa he
 These are the latest situations in Bollywood, where big movies and stars are seen licking the dust
 amitabh bachchanase lekar imran hashmi jaise diggajon kii filmein box offis par aundhe munh gir rahi hai
 With each week the deficit keeps increasing and so does the number of beaten films
 flop filmon kii is gutthi ko todane kii bollywood kii har koshish naakaam hoti dikh rahi he
 The question arises whether the rising budget, skyrocketing fees of the stars, weak story or not being able to keep pace with Bollywood from the new era is responsible for this condition? According to film director and producer Mahesh Bhattke, the cost of films has skyrocketed and the content is falling into the trough, leading to a steep decline in the success rate of films
 ve kehete hai, ''ret ke mahal ban rahe hai to girenge hi
 Weak plot and rough budget is causing failure
 ''is saal kii pehali timahi bade sitaron ke hausale badhaane vaali nahin rahi he
 Amitabh Bachchan (shamitabh), Ranbir Kapoor (roy), Emraan Hashmi (mr
 eks) kaa hashr bura rahaa he jabaki yuva sitaron arjuna kapur (tevar), sushant singh rajput (detective byomakesh bakshi) or ayushmaan khurana (hawaijada) kii filmein bhi box offis par pani maangati najar ain
 There was no name for these films
 haalanki trade export atul mohan maanate hai ki parikshaon or cricket kii vajah se pehali timahi hameshaa hi thodi feeki rahati he
 For this reason, he says, "usually in this quarter, there is an effort to release films that have a plot and that are made up of anything
" '' vajah chaahe jo ho lekin sachaai yahi he ki pichley saal sitambar se lekar ab tak pike ko chhod den to box offis par kisi bade sitare kii film chamatkaar nahin kar saki he
 This is not a good sign for an industry that has connected the dreams of crores of people and which has given India a different identity on the world stage
 oonchi dukaan, fike pakwaanahal hi menimran hashmiki mi

 is tarah imran kii 2012 ke baad yah lagaataar paanchavin flop thi
 However, Imran has not been able to take lessons from these shaking and continues to do films with weak stories
 magar film ke produsar mahesh bhatta isaki kuch or hi vajah bataate hai, ''hamane aashiqui-2 10 karod ru
 And the film collected Rs 100 crore
 kamaaye lekin is baar hamaara bajet kuch zyada hi ho gaya or aisi film banaai jaisi filmein hollywood main dhadlle se banati hai
 The budget of the film is becoming a headache for the producers and the industry
 bajet badhane kii moti vajah actaron kii badhati fees bataai jaati he
 a trade expert says that about one-third of the big star films get star fees, ie Rs 50 crore
 kii film he to 30-35 karod ru
 Till their fees are spent
 isse kamai kii margin lagaataar kam hoti ja rahi he or kai maamalon main to laagat tak nahin nikal paati
 Amitabh's Shamitabh was released recently, the film's budget is Rs 58 crore
 bataaya jaataa he par yah box offis par 18 karod ru
 Could only raise bade sitaron kii filmon ke pitane kii daastaan to kaaphi buree he
 Amitabh has given seven consecutive flops, while Saif Ali Khan (humshakals and Happy Ending) and Ranbir Kapoor's previous two films Roy (2015) and Besharm (2013) have also fallen on their faces
 imran khan to flop filmein dene ke baad drishy se hi gaayab hai jabaki ajay devgan kii singhm riterns ko chhod diya jaae to himmatwala, satyagrah or acshan jackson jaisi flop unke naam darj hai
 Atul Mohan believes that big star audiences are losing connection
 unke mutabik, ''aaj kii audiyans kuch nayaa chaahati he
 She does not want to see her hero doing the same things again and again
 lekin yah bhi dhyaan main rakhen ki alag karne kaa matlab yah nahin ki aisi cheez kar di jaae, jo logon ke palle hi na pade
 "something similar happened in the case of Imran and Amitabh
 pishan banaam bijnessaj bollywood kaa sabase bada sankat shaayad yahi he ki yahaan sab kuch bijness or kariyar ke khyaal se hone laga he
 The passion of making a film is rarely seen in a filmmaker or a star

 Says Ad Guru Prahlad Kakkar, "now the films of directors have stopped making
 aaj filmein superstars ke naam par tiki hoti hai
 The big actor must be signed, the script gets ready on the set as well
 hamaare industry ke log trend nahin hai
 The same thing finally comes out in the form of Narration Crisis
 bina prashikshan ke logon kaa kaam bhi phir alag hi dharre par chalata he
 Experts believe that regional cinema is emerging strongly due to the Narration Crisis or that small budget strong story films are being preferred
 jiskaa ishaara pichley dinon kissa (punjabi film) ke taur par dekhne ko mila jabaki enech10, dam laga ke haisha or badlapur jaisi chote or majhole bajet kii filmein box offis kii chaheti baniin
 Mahesh Bhatt says, "regional cinema is associated with roots, then the roots of Hindi cinema are being lost
" '' kala kii soch na hone se ek hi vishay par ek jaisi filmein darshakon ko bor karti hai
 For example, Fagli (2014) and Finger (2014) deal with corruption in the same way
 ab akshay kumaar bhi gabbar ij back main vahi karte najar aaenge
 Chut releases, only few prints of films were released and the number of prints was increased after public interest
 lekin, ab karan johar jaise bade produsron ne thok main ek saath print jari karne kaa rivaaj shuru kar diya he
 However, one of the reasons is that making prints has become very cheap
 pehle ek print kii keemat ek lakh ru
 Had to spend till the time the digitalization of print can be done at a nominal cost
 prahlaad kakkad kehete hai, ''bade producers ne 4,000 print ek saath relies karne shuru kiye or is tarah film kharaab bhi ho to pehle hafte main apni laagat nikaal leti thi
 But social media has made the audience grow older
 ab shanivaar aate-aate agar film kharaab he to uski hawa nikal jaati he
 The hashtag war on PK was very important on Twitter and it also played an important role in taking the film forward
 film ke samarthakon ne 'we support pk' hashtag waar chalaaya to film kaa virodh karne waalon ne 'boycott pk' ko hawa di
 In this way, the war aroused curiosity and the film gained momentum
 haalanki soshal netwarking cites kii duniya badi beraham he
 Here, only the war of good and bad goes on, how is your content, that matters

 Hello, Ravish Kumar
 1945 main berlin ke ek bunker main khudakushi karne vaale hitler kii aatma aaj bhi us arya bhoomi yani bharat main bhatak rahi he jiske nasli naam par usne lakhon yahudiyon kaa qatl kar diya
 Hitler is the biggest charge of our politics
 pataa nahin india main musolini kyon nahin koi naam letaa
 Probably because it has a weak side of ideology
 india kaa kalyaan koi dictator hi kar saktaa he aisi nasamajhi rakhane vaale samajhadaar log aaj siriyal hi dekh len to thik rahegaa
 i cannot take responsibility for their blood pressure
 1918 se 1945 ke bich kaa german itihaas
 Germany devastated by war and economic recession
 apmanjanak varsai kii sandhi
 The fall of the monarchy The birth of the republic is a long period of the process of constitution and the fall of coalition governments
 sansad chalati hi nahin thi
 In 1932, just before the year of total control of Hitler, there were only 32 meetings in the whole year of Parliament
 inhi gathbandhan sarkaron par savaar hokar italy main musolini or germany main hitler aa jaataa he
 Meanwhile, a rumor continues to spread that all this is happening because of Jews equal to one percent of the German population
 tabhi 1889 main austria main paidaa hua or kisi sainya seva ke ayogy tehra diya gaya hitler germany aata he
 In the Bavarian army, he gets a job as a communicator who later becomes a political instructor in the army
 ati rashtravaadiyon kii party german varkar party kii jasusi karte karte uskaa sadsy ban jaataa he
 Takes possession and renames the party to the National Socialist German Worker Party
 nishaan safed or laal kapade par swaastika
 Then the history of the whole world is forever interviewed from the dungeon where 6 million Jews are killed in Hitler's gas chambers and camps
 aapkaa koi padosi hitler kii tarif karata he to der mat kijiye
 If you do not get a physician, then show it to a gynecologist
 fasiwad, najivaad or stallinavaad ko ek tivi sho main sametanaa asambhav he
 Failing a military coup, Hitler, who lived in detention for five years, comes out and takes support of democracy
 apana udaar cheharaa banaata he
 He makes different promises for every section
 jinka aapas main koi lenaa dena nahin
 But within the party, only Hitler was Hitler on the lines of the mattress
 sabko hitler ke prati nishtha kii kasam khaani hoti he khaas tarah kii vardi or salaam karne kaa tarika
 If you do not confuse with Mr
 Mogambo of Mr
 India, then you have to say hell Hitler or else Sirius matter
 bibisi ke history pej se hitler kaa yah poster mila (khabar main diya gaya chitra)
 This is the poster of Hitler's election campaign
 koi naaraa nahin
 No party name
 sirf hitler likhaa he
 Hitler has a face
 german udyogpati hai class purv sainikon or barabaad middle class ko laga ki ye wo maseehaa he jo masalon ko nipta degaa
 There is also the song of Krodhi movie that is the Messiah Aaya Hai hitler nae voter par kaaphi jor detaa tha
 At that time, young men and women were quite attracted to Hitler
 agar aaj bhi galati se koi he to unki jaankaree ke liye bataa duun ki rikhstag yani german sansad main hitler kii party kii ek bhi mahila deputy nahin thi
 The party's rule was that there would be no women in senior positions
 teacher, jaj bhi nahin ban sakati
 They were removed from their jobs and placed in homes and given incentives to produce a child
 1925 main use ek nayaa saathi miltaa he joseph goabals
 Hitler's minister of propaganda
 goabals ne prachaar or propaganda kaa itihaas hi badal diya
 The whole world still considers him iron
 jaise ham ravan ko jalaakar yah bhi kehete hai ki bada viddhan tha
 To spy on the people, four lakh block leaders were deployed after dividing the flat into blocks
 goabals ne radio kaa apana hathiyaar banaaya
 At the government level, making cheap radios and transporting them home to Germany
 radio warden rakhe gaye jo dekhte the ki aap radio par bhaashan sun rahe hai ki nahin
 Otherwise, he went to work
 naji party ne germany ke saare akhabaaron ko apane niyantran main le liya
 On one hand, the democratic rights of the citizens were being taken away and they were being killed
 On the other hand, there was so much publicity of Hitler's foreign policies and economic policies that people did not care what happened in Germany
 isiilie bharat main hitler ke saath goabals kaa bhi naam aata rahata he
 Congress Communist RSS BJP Leaders of all times speak Hitler to each other
 haal hi main arun jetali ne kaha ki agar joseph goabals kaa dubaara janm ho to aam aadmi party jwine kar legaa or rahul gandhi ne jab hitler kaa naam liya to sunai modi diya
 Why do we take the name of Hitler? kya vaaki hamaari raajnneeti main fasivadi khatre hai
 Is there such economic and cultural military conditions in the presence of so many diversity institutions that one should become Hitler in India
 indira gandhi kaa apatkaal babari dhwans ke samay hindu kattarwad or communist aatank ke sandarbh main fasiwad kii pravriti kaa zikr hota he
 Is there really any Hitler among us? mujhe nahin lagata lekin 1930 ke germany main bhi mere tip kaaphi log the
 Prime time
 aaj ke is daur main garlfriend hona koi nai baat nahin he
 If there is a girlfriend, then there will be no doubt, but do you really believe in your girlfriend
 yadi karte hai to acchhee baat he lekin kahin bevajaah shaq karte hai to yah rishton main khatas paidaa kar sakati he
 But if the matter is serious and you are not able to clear the doubt even if you want, then notice these things and check if your doubt is justified
 
 
 1
 Talking on the phone secretly or SMS if you are not comfortable talking to someone in front of you, then the matter can get messed up
 2
 If it is a call or SMS first, it is not a good sign
 koi to vajah hogi ki jo vah aapako kabhi pehle SMS yaa kol nahin karti
 Sometimes it is okay, but often this can indicate a disturbance
 3
 Talk about it when there is a fight, there must be a reason behind it suddenly becoming irritable in this way

 On the Rafale issue, the Congress, while reiterating its demand to form a JPC, rejected the bjp's demand for an apology from Rahul Gandhi after the Supreme Court's decision on the issue
 congress ne bijepi ko chunauti di ki agar unhen lagata he ki is mudde par rahul ne kuch galat kaha he to satta paksh ko unke khilaaf visheshadhikaar hanan notice dena chahie
 The Supreme Court on Friday gave a clean chit to the Narendra Modi government in the case of purchase of 36 Rafale fighter jets from France
 isi faisle kaa zikr karte hue loksabhaa main grih mantri rajnath singh ne congress adhyaksh se desh or sansad se maafee maangane ko kaha tha
 When asked about this demand of the ruling party, Congress leader in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said in the Parliament House Complex news agency language, 'why apologize? We have said in the House that if they lied, then the ruling party brought a breach of privilege notice
 Kharge said that the Supreme Court did not say anything about fixing the price of the Rafale aircraft deal
 yah to ek janhit yachika thi, iskaa hamase koi sambandh nahin he
 The Congress leader said that we are raising it in Parliament, which is the highest institution in the country
 unhone ne kaha ki sarkaar ko sansad ko yah bataanaa chahie ki vah is mudde par sanyukt sansadeey samiti (jepisi) kyon nahin bananaa chaahate hai? jepisi to donon sadanon kii hoti he
 The PIL verdict cannot say that anyone was acquitted of the charges

 At the same time, JPC will conduct a comprehensive investigation of the issue

 lekin adhyaksh sumitra mahajan ne unhen yah kehete hue ijaajat nahin di ki pehle vah sadan main hangaamaa or narebaaji kar rahe apane dalon ke sadasyon ko chup karavaayen
 Earlier, the party's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala questioned why Prime Minister Narendra Modi is afraid of the JPC investigation? He said, "we had already said that the Supreme Court cannot investigate Rafael's corruption as its scope is limited under the rules, so we did not approach the court
 surajevaala ne kaha ki is maamle main bhrashtachar kii kai parate hai
 It can be investigated only by JPC investigation
 isamen tathy or sakshya donon kii chaanbin honi he
 He said that we challenge the Prime Minister to get the JPC investigated, why are you afraid of the JPC investigation? He said that these questions should be answered as to how the loss of 42 thousand crore rupees? How was the 30 thousand crore rupees contract awarded to Reliance? Why was the Cabinet Committee on Security disregarded? The Supreme Court gave a clean chit to the Narendra Modi government on Friday in connection with the purchase of 36 Rafale fighter jets from France

 ’’ Senior Congress leader Karan Singh has written a new book on meeting with 'influential women', suggesting Morarji Desai to suggest his then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to step down after the Emergency and nominate Rukmani Devi Arundel for the post of President
 Many interesting things are mentioned, including the proposal

 In the book, Karan Singh has written, one evening i wrote a personal letter on my desk by hand, in which i said that i do not personally suggest a Cabinet Minister, but personally i suggest him (indira) to resign Should, he should send his resignation to the President, who does not need to accept the resignation on the grounds that the Supreme Court will take a final decision on his (indira's) appeal

 modi raaj main badhata chalaa gaya sardaar patel kaa kadabataur CM modi ne patel kaa zikr karnaa shuru kiyaanarendra modi ke rashtriya falak par aane ke baad sardaar vallabh bhai patel kii raajnneetik taur par ahmiyat badi he or bhartiya janata party ke raaj main sardaar patel kaa kad lagaataar badhata hi ja rahaa he
 In the Congress Raj, leaders like Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi were loud and Sardar Patel was in the forefront of organizing independent India, but Modi brought Patel on the national plank and this strategy proved to be very successful
 pradhanmantri banane se pehle narendra modi gujarat main mukhyamantri the or vah yahaan 2001 se 2014 tak is pad par rahe
 Modi continued to forward Sardar Patel during his chief ministership
 yah unki hi ranneeti kaa hissaa rahaa ki patel bharat ke aaazaad hone ke 70 saal baad ab lagaataar charchaa main rahete hai
 Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2013, before Patel came to the center of not being Prime Minister and he was on stage together at a function in Gujarat on October 20 when the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was present
 isi manch se modi ne kaha tha, 'har bhartiya ke man main aaj tak is baat kii kasak he ki desh ke pehle pradhanmantri sardaar patel nahin bane
 Had Patel been the first Prime Minister of India, the picture of India would have been different
 'iske itar modi kii sakht faisle lene kii chhavi ko dekhte hue kai netaa unki tulana sardaar patel se bhi karte hai
 In August 2013, the then Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chauhan said on Twitter that the stature and work of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi can only be compared to Sardar Patel
 beti maniben or jebi kriplani ke saath sardaar patel (gettyimages)patel kii tarif ke bahaane nehru par hamalaamodi patel ke saath sahanubhuti bhi jataate rahe hai or unka kahana he ki congress ne unke saath nyaay nahin kiya
 For this, Pandit also kept attacking Jawaharlal Nehru
 pradhanmantri modi kaa yah apana ek tarika bhi he jab bhi unhen nehru par hamalaa bolnaa hota he to sardaar patel kii tarif karte hue bolte hai
 Both Narendra Modi and Sardar Patel belong to the same state (gujarat) and they talked openly about Patel while being the Chief Minister in the state
 2003 main sardaar patel kii entry!mana jaataa he ki 2003 ke baad narendra modi ke bhaashanon main sardaar patel shaamil hue or uske baad apane sambodhan main lagaataar gujarat or sardaar patel kii baat karte rahe
 Initially Modi's attempt was to present himself as a strong man and for this he also needed a well-known face which was fulfilled with the name of Sardar Patel
 narendra modi ne apane sambodhan main sardaar patel kaa zikr 2003 se shuru kiya, lekin kareeb 3 saal baad unhone ise gambhirtha le liya or jorshor se patel kaa naam uthaane lage
 It is believed that it became part of Modi's strategy in 2004 after the bjp's defeat under Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 kai netaaon ke saath sardaar patel (gettyimages)patel ke naam par congress par hamaladhire-dhire modi ne yah kahana shuru kiya ki congress raaj main khaskar nehru ke daur main sardaar patel ko uchit sammaan nahin diya gaya
 After being declared the prime ministerial candidate by the BJP in 2014, Narendra Modi gave an important place to Sardar Patel in his speeches and created a strong atmosphere against the Congress in the name of Patel
 modi ne 2014 main banpar jeet hasil kii jisamen patel kaa bhi ahm yogadan rahaa
 The project was announced on 7 October 2010 by the Modi-led Gujarat government
 sardaar patel ko sammaan dilaane ke naam par gujarat main narmada jile main statu of unity naam kii duniya kii sabase oonchi pratimaa banavaane kaa elaan kiya gaya
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi dedicated this statue to the nation on 31 October 2018, on the 143rd birthday of Sardar Patel
 narendra modiki sardaar patel ko saamne laane or unke naam par congress ko kosne kii unki ranneeti behad kargar sabit hui
 This is a strategy that the Congress does not even have the answer to
 jabaki modi ne aaj patel kaa zikr deshbhar main ched diya he or unki chunavi jeet main sardaar patel kaa bhi ahm role rahata he

 These decisions of the high command have raised questions within the Congress itself
 pradesh ke congressi netaa narayan rane ne kaha he ki faisla lene se pehle varisht netaaon se raay-mashwara hota to behatar tha
 Mumbai should have got a Marathi president on the issue of Mumbai Municipal Corporation elections

 When asked at the press conference on Rane's statement, Chavan said that Rane is a senior leader
 unki baat samajhakar pratikriya duungaa
 Meanwhile, due to the ongoing cases against him, will the Opposition not get a weapon, Chavan's answer to this question was with great emphasis that he has worked hard for four years to wash the stains

 You must have heard people saying that nothing should be hidden from doctors and lawyers
 ye baat mahilaon or purushon donon ke liye sach he lekin aaj bhi kai aisi pregnent mahilaayein hai jo mail doctor se delivery nahin karwaanaa chaahati hai
 She tolerates being in pain but she does not want to go to the mail doctor under any circumstances
 keval bharat hi nahin balki duniya ke duusare hisson main bhi kai aisi pregnent mahilaayein hai jo femail doctor dekhakar hi ilaaj karaati hai
 Keeping in mind such women, a Malaysian company, Mama Pride, has created a product
 ye ek aisi pant he jo delivery ke dauraan mahilaon kii jaanghon, takhnon or ghutane ko cover rakhegi
 The pants are designed in such a way that it will not cause the baby to come out and the mother will not have any 'embarassment'
 company kaa daawa he kiaisi kai muslim mahilaayenhain jo is baat ke liye raji hi nahin hoti hai ki koi mail doctor unki delivery karaae
 The company wrote on its Facebook page, 'during the delivery of the child, the modesty of women is often ignored
 hamane ek aisa vikalp dene kii koshish kii he jisase bachche ke janm kii prakriya main koi dikkat nahin aegi or saath hi jaruri angon ko dhakkar bhi rakhaa ja sakegaa
 'the company has also written,' The decision to buy this pants is entirely on the woman
 hamane kabhi apane product kaa istemaal karne ke liye kisi par dabaav nahin banaaya he
 We have tried to provide solutions in the hope that women will not face any problem in getting delivery from the mail doctor
 ham hameshaa apane graahakon se kehete hai ki is product bare main apane doctor se jarur baat kar len
 We also believe that some hospitals have not liked this idea of ours
 'company is pant ko apane fasebuk pej ke madhyam se pramot karne ke saath bech bhi rahi he
 These pants are priced at 20 pounds and are available in large, XL and XL sizes
 ye pant dekhne main baigi trekksoot kii tarah he
 It is worth noting that instead of getting a normal delivery from a mail doctor, many women prefer Caesarean
 ummid he ki aisi mahilaon ke liye ye pant vaaki kargar sabit ho sakati he
 Difficult news is coming for Indian prepaid users from the Telecom Department
 kyonki aane vaale dinon main preeped yugers pehle kii tarah richarge nahin kara paaenge
 Aadhar card or recognized identity card will be required to recharge the prepaid SIM
 department of telecom nesupreme court se kaha he ki desh ke 90 fisadeepreeped sim graahakon ko apana mobile richarge karaane ke liye pahchaan patr dena hoga
 It is worth noting that about 90 percent of the mobile users in India have a prepaid SIM while only 10 percent of the users use a postpaid SIM
 atorni general mukul rohtagi ke mutabik is program kii shuruyaat main lagbhag 1 saal lag sakate hai
 Under this, prepaid cards cannot be recharged without showing Aadhaar card or valid identity card
 bina veriphication ke preeped sim lenaa mushkilamtaur par preeped sim lenaa postped ke mukaable aasaan mana jaataa he
 Because it carries less verification than postpaid
 lekin aane vaale samay main yah itnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 The Supreme Court has asked the government to investigate the identity of all prepaid users, so that the SIM is not misused
 chif justise of india jees khehar kii adhyakshata vaali ek bench ne kaha he ki ise kai charnon main puraa kiya jayega
 All new mobile subscribers will be asked to fill the Aadhaar based e-kyc form within a year
 iske tahat un puraane customers kii veriffekeshan ke liye chah maheene kaa samay diya jayega jinhone bina veriphication ke sim liya he
 If they do not submit their identity card during this period, they can be banned for recharging
 puure bharat main rangon ke tyohaar holi badi dhoomdhaam ke saath manaaya jaataa he
 Everyone celebrates this festival with colors
 lekin desh main kai aisi jagah bhi hai, jahaan holi nahin manaai jaati
 Due to a decree of the British, this festival is not celebrated here, rather people celebrate this festival with colors on the next day
 yah jagah he madhyapradesh ke jhaansi, jahaan ke kuch ilaakon main holi ko dhoomdhaam se nahin manaaya jaataa he
 What was the decree of the British, it is said that on the day of Holi, the British refused to accept Laxmibai's son Damodar Rao as the heir
 jiske baad lakshmi bai ne holi nahin manaai or vahaan ke logon ne bhi aisa kiya
 Since then, the people here are keeping it intact and not celebrating Holi
 haalanki ab dhire-dhire log holi manaane lag gaye hai
 It did not happen many years ago
 darasal 21 november, 1853 ko jhaansi ke raja gangadhar raav kii mrityu ke baad vahaan kii kaman lakshmibai ne sanbhali thi
 Gangadhar Rao had adopted a child (damodar Rao) before he died and was declared heir
 haalanki angrejon ne use uttaradhikari nahin mana or angrejon ne jis din is baat kaa elaan kiya tha, wo din holi kaa hi tha
 Therefore some people did not celebrate Holi there
 jhaansi gajetir main darj itihaas ke mutabik yah durbhagyapurna ghatana thik holi ke din ghati thi
 Preparations were on for the celebration of Holi
 isi bich angrejon kaa tughluqi farmaan sunaaya gaya
 People drowned in mourning and Holi was not celebrated
 rani ne kila choda or duusare mahal main chali gayi
 In this sorrow, even today many people of Jhansi do not celebrate Holi on the day of Holi
 aazaadee ke baad kii congress kaa itihaas puri tarah se nehru-gandhi parivaar ke ird-gird hi simata rahaa he
 Whatever leader other than this family rose to the top position, it was either forced to go backstage or the Congress was able to fix the problems of the country by burying the heads of those people
 parivaar ke baahar ke party adhyaksh akasar gumnami main kho jate hai
 The rulings between Narasimha Rao and Congress leader Sitaram Kesari are not hidden from anyone
 kesari ko jabaran congress adhyaksh pad se hataa sonia gandhi ko kaman saunpi gai
 On March 19, 2007, when he first became an MP, Rahul Gandhi, on a road show campaign to revive the Congress, blamed the then Prime Minister Narasimha Rao for the reluctant Babri Masjid demolition
 rahul ne tab kaha tha, ‘‘agar 1992 main nehru-gandhi parivaar se koi satta main yaa sakriy raajnneeti main hota to babari masjid dhahaane kii ghatana nahin hoti
 "rahul Gandhi not only raised Narasimha Rao in the dock, but also mentioned the idea put on behalf of father Rajiv Gandhi in front of mother Sonia Gandhi," My father told my mother that Babri Masjid i will stand in front of the mosque myself to save it, and those who break the mosque will have to kill me first
 ’’haalanki march 2007 main rahul kii is tippanee par bijepi netaa sushamaa swaraj ne chutki lee thi, ‘‘abhi to rahul ne narsingh raav ko katghare main khadaa kiya, par jab manmohan singh piem nahin rahenge to rahul kii tippanee hogi-gandhi parivaar kaa piem hota to nandigram yaa mahangaai nahin hoti
 After criticizing his Guru Rao, who brought Prime Minister Manmohan Singh into politics, he called Rao a ascetic and guide
 raav kii ichha ke baavjood congress ne unhen loksabhaa chunaav ladgaye kaa tikat nahin diya tha
 Still, on the birth anniversary or death date, Rao is seen buried in the government advertisements of the Ministry of Information Broadcasting, while a gandhi-nehru family member prepares for the birth anniversary date months ahead and the newspapers are covered with advertisements
 manmohan raaj main hi jab vishesh aarthik jone, bhoomi adhigrahan, mahangaai jaise mudde sarkaar kii pareshaani kaa kaaran bane to sonia gandhi ne chitthee likhakar sara thikra sarkaar ke sir phodde kii koshish kii
 Whereas the Gandhi family continued to get credit for every positive initiative
 artiai, manaregaa, shiksha kaa adhikaar, bhojan kaa adhikaar jaise ahm kanoonon kaa shrey manmohan sarkaar ko nahin, balki sonia gandhi ko hi diya gaya
 There is still no such thing as collective leadership in the Congress
 agar kisi rajya main congress haar jaae to uskaa thikra sanghathan par footataa he, lekin jahaan party jiti he vahaan sara shrey gandhi parivaar ko diya jaataa he
 In the last UP assembly elections, Rahul claimed responsibility for the defeat, then Congress General Secretary Digvijia Singh immediately said that it is not Rahul's responsibility to lose
 gandhi parivaar ke khilaaf aawaaj buland karne vaala chaahe natwar singh jaisaa diggaj ho yaa gandhi parivaar ke damaad robert wadra ke khilaaf morcha kholane vaale gudgaanv ke congressi saansad raav inderjeet singh, aise shaks kabhi bhi congress main nahin tik pate
 Jitendra Prasad, who contested the election of president against Sonia, remained completely isolated at the last minute
 kya manmohan singh bhi raav or kesari kii gati ko praapt honge yaa phir ve is tufaan ko bhi jhel lenge? The sensation spread as the woman's body was found at the Boys Hostel in Betul, Madhya Pradesh
 yuvati kii hostel ke andar hi galaa retkar hatya kii gai he
 The police have registered a case and started investigating the case
 hostel ke ladakon se poochtacha kii ja rahi he
 Station in-charge Pankaj Tyagi said that three youths live in hostel room number-26
 inamen se ek kamalesh naam ke yuvak kaa aarti chadhokar naam kii yuvati ke saath prem-prasang chal rahaa tha
 Often the two used to meet in the same room of the hostel
 unhone batayaki shuukravaar kii subah bhi donon kamare main the
 After this at around 12 o'clock the body of Aarti was found in the room
 uske gale par dhardaar hathiyaar se kai baar waar kiye gaye hai
 Her lover Kamlesh is suspected of murder
 do yuvakon ko hiraasat main le liya gaya he
 In the horoscope, the planet Venus and the Moon are considered feminine planets
 shukr grah or chandramaa kii puja karne se mahalakshmi kii vishesh krupa praapt hoti he
 Black and blue should not be used at home for the pleasure of Venus and Moon
 apane ghar ke dakshin purvi bhaag main rasoi ghar jarur banaaen
 Everyday women should burn a lamp in the same direction of the house before working in the kitchen
 uske baad hi rasoi ghar kaa kaary aarambh karen
 Women of the house should not do any work in the kitchen without taking bath
 hameshaa apni rasoi ghar main maa annapurna kii photo jarur sthapit karen
 Whenever you start work, first see Maa Annapurna
 aisa karne se ghar ke sabhi log swasth rahenge or bhojan bhi swaadisht banegaa or saath hi saath bhagwaan lakshminarayan ji kii krupa jarur hogi
 What are the small mistakes that make your home inhabited by impoverishment - in a house where women are not respected, there is an abode of impoverishment in the house due to the inauspiciousness of Venus and Moon
 - ghar ke dakshin purvi kone main arthath aagney kone main jalairao rakhane se vahaan vaastu dosha utpann hota he, jisase ghar main hameshaa ke liye daridrata kaa vaas ho jaataa he
 - Everyday waking up late at night and waking up late in the morning also causes poorness in the house due to the side effects of Saturn and Moon
 - ghar me choti-choti baton par aapasi kalah ke kaaran bhi ghar kii aarthik sthiti din pratidin kharaab hone lagati he
 - Mother Lakshmi gets annoyed even because of dirty clothes in the house and stored broken things
 - khaastaur par apni patni kaa apmaan karne se maa lakshmi aapke ghar kaa rasta hi bhul jaati hai or aapako dhan ke liye dar-dar bhatakana padataa he
 Great way to please Lord Lakshminarayan ji - Get up early in the morning and wash your bath and wear clean clothes
 - gehun ke aate kaa ek diya banaaen
 Place desi ghee and desi camphor in the lamp with Kalave ki Baati
 - shri lakshmi narayan ji ke saamne yah diya jalaaen
 - ॐ Read Shri Shri Mahalakshmaye Namah Mantra 108 times sitting on a red seat
 - apana munh uttar disha kii taraf rakhe or ridh kii haddi ko sidhaa rakhen
 - Pray for food, money and barkat in your home
 maa lakshmi ko prasann karne kaa mahaamantra-- shukla paksh ke shuukravaar ke din shaam ke samay snaan karke ek laal asana par baithen or apana munh uttar yaa purv disha kii taraf rakhen
 - Now spread a red meter in front of you and install a photo of Shri Lakshmi Narayan Ji on it and light a lamp of cow's ghee
 - ek shuddh sphatik kii maala se daridradhvansni namah mantra kaa 5 maala jaap karen
 - After chanting offer the perfume of rose to Lord Lakshminarayana and use the same perfume everyday
 - jaruratmand logon ko sabut chaaval kii kheer jarur baaten
 Despite Virat Kohli's brilliant century in the third ODI played between India and Australia on MCG, Team India lost once again
 haalanki team india match haar gai lekin match ke dauraan is match main shatak jamaane vaale kohli ne bowler james foconor kii sledging kaa tagada jawaab diya
 Kohli, who scored a half-century in the first two matches of Kohli's first innings with his bat and mouth, finally made his innings reach three points
 apni is pari ke dauraan kohli ne naa sirf apane balle kaa dam dikhaaya balki apni sledging se bhi kangaaroon kii jamkar khabar lee
 Virat replied to Faulkner saying, Go do your job in the middle of Karokohli's innings, when Osie's bowler Faulkner tried to confuse him literally
 maine tumhen khub dhoyaa haitisare vanade ke shatakaveer kohli jab batting kar rahe the to australian bowler james foconor ne ek gend par kohli ke chook jane par chutki lete hue kaha, 'tumne meri gend par shot lagane kii koshish kii lekin tum fail ho gaye
 On this matter of Faulkner, Kohli said in a mild mood, 'don't waste your energy
 main apane kariyar main tumhen achche se dho chukaa hum
 Go do your work ' kohli or foconor kii is muthbhed kaa video viral ho chukaa he
 You also see that video 'just go and bowl, don't waste your time
 I've smashed you Enough in my Life' - Kohli to Faulkner

 com (@cricketopia)january 17, 2016 If you are in a relationship then you must also feel how courageous it is to be with someone
 kisi pyaar karne vaale ke hone se jindagi kitni khubasurat ho jaati he
 But there are many occasions when you would think that it would be better to remain single than to be in a relationship
 ye kuch aise mushkil bhare pal hote hai jab aapkaa bharosa dagamagaa jaataa he
 Although this does not mean that the love between you two is over, but in these moments, you want to leave every responsibility and go alone
 ye hai wo aise maukey jab ek ladki sochati he ki single rahanaa hi behatar hota:1
 Many times you would feel like not staying on a date, you stay at home and wear team pajamas and cheer on Team India
 lekin aapkaa bwoyfriend aapako date par le janaa chahta he
 At such a time, you feel that if you were alone, you would have been able to do what you are doing
 2
 While all your friends are going to hang out, you have to go to meet your boyfriend's parents
 aise main dil karata he kaash! main dobaaraa se single ban jaati
 3
 aap apane liye nayaa mechap kit lenaa chaahati hongi lekin nahin le paa rahi hongi kyonki isi maheene aapke bwoyfriend kaa janmdin he or aapako use ek branded ghadi gift kerani he
 4
 aap apane bachapan ke doston ke saath masti karne janaa chaahati hai lekin aapke bwoyfriend ko wo pasand nahin he
 In such a situation, i feel that if i was single, it would have been better
 5
 You cannot put every picture on Facebook because your boyfriend's housemates are also in your friendlist
 aise main dil to karata he ki
 
 
 6
 aap sirf apane liye kuch bhi nahin kharid saktin
 While shopping for yourself, you have to shop for your boyfriend even if you don't want to
 7
 Sometimes you have to make excuses to meet your own family members
 8
 The most sad is when you come to know that the person in the office is still single on whom you had a crush

 In fact, Imran Khan met the media on Wednesday in the United Nations
 isi dauraan unase jammu-kashmir or narendra modi-donald trump kii mulaakaat par kai sawaal hue
 Meanwhile, Imran Khan has once again threatened to worsen the situation, saying that India should remove curfew from Jammu and Kashmir at the earliest
 gauratlab he ki imran khan kaa ye bayaan us vakt aayaa he, jab donald trump ne narendra modi se mulaakaat kar jammu-kashmir kaa masalaa bharat ke bharose chhodane kii baat kahi
 Donald Trump had said that Narendra Modi will handle the matter of Kashmir, there is nothing to worry about it
 antarrashtriya samachar agency AP ke anusaar, imran khan ne yahaan kaha ki jammu-kashmir ke logon par se karfu hataanaa chahie, is masale par antarrashtriya sanghathanon ko bharat se apil kerani chahie
 However, Imran Khan has already confessed two days ago that the world has not listened to him on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan is left alone on this issue
 aapako bataa den ki donald trump or narendra modi ke bich buudhvaar ko neuyork main mulaakaat hui
 During this time, Trump read praises to PM Modi, calling him 'father of India' and comparing him to Elvis Bresley
 isi bich pakistani pradhanmantri lagaataar narendra modi par aarope laga rahe hai
 Not only this, when it came to dealing with Pakistani-backed terror, Donald Trump said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will deal with it on his own and he will solve the issue of Jammu and Kashmir too

 australian sarajameen par apane pehle test main prabhavit karne vaale bhartiya spinner kuldeep yadav ne kaha ki unhen test gendbaaj ke rup main sudhaar karne ke liye or samay kii jarurat he
 The 24-year-old left-arm wrist spinner picked up three wickets, leaving the Australian team battling losing six wickets for 236 in response to India's declared first innings of 622 for seven on the third day of the fourth Test
 lords ke baad videshi sarajameen par apana pehla test khel rahe kuldeep ne kaha ki vah thode nervas the
 Kuldeep said on Saturday, 'to be honest, i have not changed anything to bowl in Australia
 main is siries main apana pehla test khel rahaa hum isliye thodaa nervas tha
 Kuldeep said, "I have played so much cricket that i know well, but in Test cricket i probably need a little more time to improve
" aap jitna adhik laal gend se kheloge, utana hi zyada aap sudhaar kar sakate ho
 He said that there can be no other alternative to the experience of playing in a match, that is why a bowler's performance improves
 kuldeep ne kaha, ‘test cricket bhi aisa hi, jitna zyada aap kheloge, utane behatar dhang se aap ballebaaj ko pard sakoge
 You will have time to plan for the batsman and you will be able to throw as many overs and change the fielding
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘safed gend ke cricket kii tulana main laal gend ke cricket main zyada dabaav hota he
 As a leg-spinner, you need at least 10 days to change yourself and control things accordingly
 ’sapaat pich par bhi nahin chale kangaroo, lachar batting ke liye Twitter par uda majaakbata den ki kuldeep yadav or rabindra jadeja ne sidney cricket ground kii sapaat si pich par shanivaar ko apni phiraki kaa kamaal dikhaaya, jisase bharat ne australia ke khilaaf chauthe or antim test cricket match ke barish se prabhavit tisare din bhi apana palada baari rakhaa
 When Australia struggled to save the follow on, scoring 236 for six, rain came to its rescue in the third session
 jiske baad aage kaa khel nahin ho paaya
 India is still 386 runs ahead of Australia
 bharat ne apni pehali pari saat wicket par 622 ran banaakar samaapt ghoshit kii thi
 Due to rain, almost 16 overs were not played on the third day and now the game of the fourth day will start half an hour earlier
 aise main dekhnaa he ki peter handscomb (naabad 28) or pat kamins (naabad 25) australian sangharsh ko kahaan tak khinch pate hai
 Both of them have now added 38 runs for the seventh wicket
 chauthe or paanchaven din kaa khel aadha ghanta pehle yani bhartiya samyaanusaar subah 4:30 baje se shuru hoga
 Australia is still 386 runs behind India
 australia par foloon kaa khatra bhi mandaraane laga he
 The SCG pitch did not help Indian fast bowlers Mohammad Shami (one wicket for 54) and Jaspreet Bumrah (no wickets for 43), but left-arm spinner Jadeja (2 for 62) and Chinaman spinner Kuldeep Yadav (three for 71) plagued the Australian batsmen

 Akhilesh had said that Gujaratis promote donkeys on TV and come to UP and talk about cremation and burial
 piem ne kaha- main hairaan hum ki aapaki jativaadee maansikta se ki pashu main bhi oonch-neech kaa bhav dekhne lag gaye
 You started to feel so bad ass
 gadhaa bhi hamen prerana detaa he
 He is always loyal to his boss and carries the responsibilities
 jinke gale lagakar aap vot maang rahe ho usee upie sarkaar ne 2013 main gujarat ke gadhon kaa postal stamp nikaala tha
 Akhilesh, where you are talking about donkey, is the place where Gandhi, Sardar Patel was born
 krishna ne use apni karmbhumi banaai
 Significantly, Akhilesh Yadav appealed to superstar Amitabh Bachchan at a rally in Rae Bareli and said, 'we request the superstar of the century to stop promoting the donkeys of Gujarat
 ' unhone aage kaha ki 'agar gadhon kaa prachaar hone lagegaa to kaise chalegaa
 People of Gujarat are also promoting the donkeys there
 gadhe kaa bhi kahin prachaar karaayaa jaataa he

 He further said that if the donkeys start promoting, then how will it work
 gujarat ke log to vahaan ke gadhon kaa bhi prachaar karvaa rahe hai
 The donkey is also promoted somewhere
 ' bataa den ki amitabh bachchan gujarat paryaton ke brands ambeseder hai or usee sambandh main akhilesh yadav yah sab kuch kah gaye
 In fact, he was in retaliation for what PM Modi said on Sunday when he accused the SP of discriminating in the name of religion in UP
 akhilesh ne kaha tha ki gujarat vaale tivi par gadhon kaa prachaar karaate hai or upi main aakar shmashaan or kabristaan kii baat karte hai
 The year 2018 was much better in terms of box office, but the two big festive weekends of the last quarter proved to be a disappointment in terms of earnings
 hairaan karne vaali baat yah thi ki diwali or christmas ke weekend main saal kii do badi bajet kii film tikat khidki par bemaut maari gayi
 First Aamir Khan's Thugs of India and later Shah Rukh Khan's Zero proved to be a complete failure
 in donon filmon kii vajah se manoranjan jagat ke karodon rupee to duube hi darshakon kaa manoranjan bhi behad kharaab rahaa
 Now there is a lot of hope that at the end of the year Ranveer Singh's Simba will make up for both losses in terms of business and entertainment
 tikat khidki kaa pichhlaa trend iskaa saboot detaa bhi najar aa rahaa he
 Let's know how
 
 
 simba ke phul saxes kii guarantee iske saath do teen bharosemand naamon kaa judaa hona he
 Needless to say that the name of the film's hero Ranveer Singh, director Rohit Shetty and Dharma Productions Karan Johar
 teenon kaa trek record jabardast he
 Padmavat released in the same year is among the five highest-grossing Hindi films
 bhale hi deepika film kii 'hero' thim lekin bataane kii jarurat nahin ki allaudin kilji bane ranvir kaa andaaj khub bhaayaa
 Khali Bali's hangover is still fresh in people's hearts
 duusari baat rohit shetty kaa 'shartiya' manoranjan kaa masaaledaar dose
 If we look at Chennai Express, Singham Returns and Golmaal Again, these films had a bumper opening on the first day
 simba ke trailor se sabit hota he ki ye usee range kaa cinema hoga
