 The family alleges that Safdarjung asked to be taken home only by prescribing medication, even after dengue was confirmed

 After being admitted there for three days, the hospital expressed its inability to get proper treatment

 All these hospitals refused to enroll due to lack of beds
 phir jaise taise holi family aspataal main aman ko bhartee karaayaa gaya jahaan qareeb 12 ghante ke ilaaj ke baad uski maut ho gai
 Between Thursday and Sunday, the family continued to run from this hospital to that hospital

 The hospital said take Aman to a big hospital where there are treatment facilities
 - aspataal number do he safadarajang aspataal
 - Hospital number three Jeevan Hospital where Aman's condition worsens and the hospital says that he is incapable
 - aspataal number chaar moolchand aspataal jisase maa baap ne sampark kiya, magar bed nahin mila
 - Hospital number five Batra Hospital, which parents also contacted for recruitment
 - aspataal number chah maiks aspataal jisase bhi sampark kiya lekin bed kii kami bataai gai
 - Hospital number seven Holi family where admitted, it was late and Aman lost his life
 dilli main dengue kab se he
 But you remember what our news channels were doing for the last few weeks
 ek hi netaa kii raily ko din main do baar dikhaa rahe the
 Lalu Yadav's channel-by-channel interview was going on
 ek bhi seat na jeetne vaale ovaisi ko bihar chunaav ke bahaane bijepi ke baraabar kawarez diya ja rahaa tha
 Radhe Maa and Indrani Mukherjee were playing with news in prime time
 ek channel par radhe maa kii samarthika or ek lalaranga mahatma ke bich live thappad chale to kai channelon ne footage manga liye
 It is called playing in the world language of our channels
 channelon ne is footage ko lekar khub khelaa
 You also played audience with him
 ab aap aman or avinaash kii maut ke baad kisi bhi channel ke ankar kii bhashaa dekhiye
 It would seem that to avenge Aman and Avinash's death, they have taken off in the same way as they were taking the lead to liberate you from the love trap of Radhe Maa
 hamaari duniya ke log aapke bare main bataate hai ki aap log ghar laut kar kuch intertaning dekhnaa chaahate hai
 i myself am involved in this criticism
 aadhi duniya dengue failaane vaale machharon kii giraft main he
 Latin American countries like Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Asian countries like India Pakistan
 machhar ke kaatane par uski laar main maujuud dengue ke virus insaan ke jism main chale jate hai
 The dengue virus in the body infects the immune cells present in the skin, ie immune cells
 iske baad virus sharir ke ahm limphatic system main pravesh kar jaataa he is dauraan virus se sankramit mariz ko tej bukhaar aata he
 It has a local effect in the initial phase ie the incubation period
 phir ye khun kii nalikaaon se hokar mariz ke puure sharir main fail jaataa he ise veremia kehete hai
 Some patients and especially children have very high fever at times
 jise dengue hemoragic (hemorrhagic) fever kehete hai
 It starts to leak from blood vessels and leaks plasma
 agar machhar kisi dengue ke marij ko katata he to uske khun main maujuud virus apane saath lekar duusare swasth logon main failaane kaa kaam karata he
 There has been a dengue panic in Delhi since 1996
 dengue ko lekar jo karnaa chahie use lekar bahes hone lagi he, honi chahie kyonki agar ham ye kar pate to itane logon ko degun nahin hota

 So far 3365 notices have been sent to government buildings
 raashtrapati bhawan ko saal bhar main 90 notice bheje ja chuke hai
 Mosquitoes have been found to thrive in the coolers there
 ames ko bhi 22 notice bheje gaye hai
 There have been 9 invoices
 safadarajang ko bhi 12 notice bheje gaye hai
 When notices are being given to hospitals, then understand what will happen to other places
 jab koi kaam kar rahaa tha tab bhi kisi ko kuch fark nahin pad rahaa tha
 This is what is shown by invoices and notices

 Looking at it carefully, we came to know that MCD has such a pencil which glows in the same way as written in January
 laga ki kisi ne ek hi baar main nau maheene ke kaam kaa hisaab likh diya he
 Seeing the same type of signature, there was a fellow who fogged here for nine months and signed on the wall

 The villagers told that as soon as the news of Avinash's death was published, toilets started coming out of the village

 So far 1872 cases of dengue have been reported in Delhi
 jab itane bade shahar main is choti si sankhya ke laayak bed nahin he, yaa paanch sau hazaar marizon ke liye bed nahin he to sochiye ki desh ke baaki hisson main kya hota hoga
 Since when is dengue in Delhi lekin aap yaad kiijie to hamaare news channel pichley kuch hafton se kya kar rahe the
 They were showing the same leader's rally twice a day
 lalu yadav kaa channel dar channel intervyuu chal rahaa tha
 Owaisi, who did not win a single seat, was being given equal coverage to the BJP on the pretext of Bihar elections
 prime timon main radhe maa or indrani mukherjee kii khabar se khel rahe the
 On one channel, a live slap between Radhe Maa's Samarthika and a Lalaranga Mahatma went on, and many channels asked for footage
 hamaare channelon kii duniya kii bhashaa main ise khelnaa kehete hai
 The channels played a lot about this footage
 unke saath aap darshak bhi khele
 Now after the death of Aman and Avinash, see the language of the anchor of any channel
 lagegaa ki aman or avinaash kii maut kaa badla lene ke liye usee tarah se utaaru ho gaye hai jaise ve radhe maa ke moh jaal se aapako azaad karne kaa bidaa uthaae hue the
 People of our world tell about you that you want to return home and see some entertainment
 is aalochana main main khud bhi shaamil hum
 Half the world is in the grip of mosquitoes that spread dengue
 latin america desh jaise argentina, maxico, chile or asian desh jaise bharat pakistan
 After mosquito bite, the dengue virus present in its saliva goes into human body
 jism main pahunchaa dengue virus twachaa main maujuud pratirodhi koshikaayen yani immune cells ko sankramit karata he
 After this, the virus enters the vital lymphatic system of the body, during which the virus infected patient has high fever
 shuruaati daur yani incubation period main iskaa sthaneey asar hota he
 Then it spreads through the blood vessels throughout the patient's body, it is called Veremia
 kuch marizon or khaskar bacchon main kai baar bahut tej bukhaar ho jaataa he
 Which is called dengue hemorrhagic fever
 isamen khun kii naliyon se risaav shuru ho jaataa he or usase plasma kii licage shuru ho jaati he
 If a mosquito bites a dengue patient, then the virus present in its blood carries with it the function of spreading to other healthy people
 1996 se dilli main dengue kaa aatank he
 There has been a debate about what should be done about dengue, because if we could have done this, then not many people would have been deified
 is bahes kaa doosraa pahalu he aspataalon kii kshamta, zimmedaari or javabdehi kaa
 Look at any debate
 mul sawaal se bhatak kar emsidi banaam dilli sarkaar main badal gai he
 It should be the matter of the Astpals, the cost of hoarding being talked about
 baat safai kii honi chahie to baat ho rahi he ki koun hamase kharaab he
 Aman and Avinash would not have died if the MCD and the government and civil society had been aware
 kaam kar rahaa hota
 If everyone was doing their own work then Aman and Avinash would not have died
 kai baar sansthaaen kaam bhi karti hai to koi notice nahin letaa
 Now NDMC has challaned 193 buildings, including Rashtrapati Bhavan, on mosquito breeding
 sarkari imaaraton ko ab tak 3365 notice bheje hai
 90 notices have been sent to Rashtrapati Bhavan in a year
 vahaan ke culeron main machharon ko panpate paaya gaya he
 AIIMS has also sent 22 notices
 9 chaalaan hue hai
 12 notices have also been sent to Safdarjung
 jab aspataalon ko notice diye ja rahe hai to samajhiye ki baaki jagahon kaa kya hota hoga
 Even when one was working, no one was making any difference
 chaalaan or notice se yahi pataa chalata he
 Our system has another method
 jab kaam na karte hue pakade jaaen to aisa kuch kiya jaae jisase lage ki kaam kiya ja chukaa he
 The comments jab ham somvaar ko lado sarai gaye to vahaan kii diwaar par janvari se lekar sitambar tak kii taarikh likhi hui thi
 Fogging took place here on these dates
 gaur se dekha to pataa chalaa ki emsidi ke paas koi aisi pencil he jiskaa janvari main likhaa vaise hi chamakta he jaise sitambar kaa likhaa hua
 It seemed that someone had written the account of nine months of work at once
 ek hi tarah ke dastakhat dekh kar laga ki koi to banda he jo nau maheene se yahaan foging kar diwaar par sin karata he
 Impressed by its work, the handwriting of the pencil has also declined
 bas logon ko nahin dikhaa ki maut or khudakushi se pehle foging hui thi
 In the name of daub, new posters were put up and it seemed that there is a lot of caution about cleanliness
 gaanv waalon ne bataaya ki avinaash kii maut kii khabar chhapate hi gaanv ke baahar shauchalay banane laga
 There is so much power in the system that in 24 hours the city can prove that it was a city for centuries
 dilli main abhi tak dengue ke 1872 maamle aa chuke hai
 When such a big city does not have this small number of beds, or beds for 500 thousand patients, then imagine what would happen in the rest of the country
 ek channel par radhe maa kii samarthika or ek lalaranga mahatma ke bich live thappad chale to kai channelon ne footage manga liye
 It is called playing in the world language of our channels
 channelon ne is footage ko lekar khub khelaa
 You also played audience with him
 ab aap aman or avinaash kii maut ke baad kisi bhi channel ke ankar kii bhashaa dekhiye
 It would seem that to avenge Aman and Avinash's death, they have taken off in the same way as they were taking the lead to liberate you from the love trap of Radhe Maa
 hamaari duniya ke log aapke bare main bataate hai ki aap log ghar laut kar kuch intertaning dekhnaa chaahate hai
 i myself am involved in this criticism
 aadhi duniya dengue failaane vaale machharon kii giraft main he
 Latin American countries like Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Asian countries like India Pakistan
 machhar ke kaatane par uski laar main maujuud dengue ke virus insaan ke jism main chale jate hai
 The dengue virus in the body infects the immune cells present in the skin, ie immune cells
 iske baad virus sharir ke ahm limphatic system main pravesh kar jaataa he is dauraan virus se sankramit mariz ko tej bukhaar aata he
 It has a local effect in the initial phase ie the incubation period
 phir ye khun kii nalikaaon se hokar mariz ke puure sharir main fail jaataa he ise veremia kehete hai
 Some patients and especially children have very high fever at times
 jise dengue hemoragic (hemorrhagic) fever kehete hai
 It starts to leak from blood vessels and leaks plasma
 agar machhar kisi dengue ke marij ko katata he to uske khun main maujuud virus apane saath lekar duusare swasth logon main failaane kaa kaam karata he
 There has been a dengue panic in Delhi since 1996
 dengue ko lekar jo karnaa chahie use lekar bahes hone lagi he, honi chahie kyonki agar ham ye kar pate to itane logon ko degun nahin hota
 Another aspect of this debate is the capacity, responsibility and accountability of hospitals
 aap kisi bhi bahes ko dekhiye

 Narasimha Rao started economic reforms in the country, but former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee showed the strength to carry it forward

 According to Trivedi, Vajpayee had grown up with the Sangh during this period

 Vijay said that Vajpayee doctrine is mentioned in history
 aisa isliye he ki bataur piem vaajapeyi sabhi se conect rakhana jaanate the
 As much as he used to meet in contact with the camps made inside the party, he also believed in meeting the most in opposition and keeping connected
 yah kaam piem modi nahin kar paa rahe hai lihaaja is lihaaj se bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki atal ji maujuuda piem modi se zyada taqatvar the
 However, Mahurkar said that the manner in which PM Modi has worked in the field of transparency in the administration is enough to make him the most powerful PM in the country

 i have learned to be patient while working on issues related to education in India for fifteen years
 is kshetra main visheshgyon kii bharmaar he
 He has deep loyalty in his work, is knowledgeable, has good intentions and speaks with full authority
 ye sabhi visheshgy un nae logon ke saath thode besabr ho jate hai, jo aankadon or sabooton kii baaten karte hai or kabhi-kabhi gaharaa hastkshep karte hai, jabaki in logon ne shiksha ke siddhanton par dashakon tak sirakhpai to kii nahin hoti he
 One such expert had told one such novel a few years ago that those who talk about education, they do not know how to read themselves
 ” samaj main aayaa aapako?sabar jaruri he kyonki shiksha niti par visheshgyon kaa khaasaa asar rahata he
 He was the one who enacted the Right to Education (RTE) Bill to make his dream come true for every child
 sapana hamaara bhi yahi he, lekin us par charchaa ke dauraan hamen nahin bulaayaa gaya
 In fact, in the 'rights' we have got today, a special approach has been given preference in terms of quality of education
 yah bihar, rajasthan yaa uttar pradesh ke gaanvon kii bajaay shahari dilli ke liye zyada vyaavhaarik lagati he
 We work in those villages
 kya vaaki hamane maan liya he ki garib bhartiya abhibhavak aise skool chaahate hai, jinamein khel ke maidan hon or adhyapakon ke paas pramanik degree ho? to phir sarkari skulon ke bachche pichley ek dashak se aakhir kyon nikal bhaag rahe hai, jabaki vahaan aise shikshak or khel ke maidan donon hote hai? vahi bachche jin nijee skulon main pahunchate hai, ve akasar kisi ke khaali pade kamaron main chal rahe hote hai or shikshak ke paas saare jaruri pramaan-patr mil paanaa bhi jaruri nahin
 But the parents keep repeating that he comes to teach at least and does some hard work
 ham nahin maanate ki sirf nijee skool shiksha kii hamaari sari samasyaayein sulajh denge, par bacchon ke skool agar is kanoon kii sharten puri na karne kii vajah se band ho jaaen to abhibhavakon ko kaisaa lagegaa?shaayad ab sabar khone kaa vakt aa gaya he
 Pratham has recently released an annual condition-education report
 isse pichley saal pehali baar dikhe chintajanak rujhaan kii pushti ho jaati he
 Examination of 4,48,545 children (aged 5 to 16) from 16,166 villages (aged 5 to 16) spread across 567 districts across India makes one thing clear: to be able to do basic manipulations and read simple paragraphs in India
 The proportion of children receiving is declining rapidly
 kamyaabi kii ikkaa-dukka misaalen dikhti hai par kul jamaa tasviir dhundhlee he
 Yet, experts (as Vinod Raina, one of the RTE craftsmen, also wrote in an India Today issue) have surprisingly put the blame on the test
 raina ke kehane kaa labbolubaab yahi he ki bachche ko bukhaar he, to tharmametre tod do
 a thermometer causes tension in the child and this is why he must have fever
 raina kii tippanee main test or test ke numberon ke aadhaar par die jane vaale protsaahanon ko lekar tagdi bhranti he
 The annual report on the state of education gives an opportunity to know where this country stands
 uskaa sandesh yah he ki bachche fail nahin ho rahe balki bacchon ke liye agni pariksha main desh fail ho rahaa he
 It is a simple matter that such an examination actually has a very minor effect, it can be so full that everyone is motivated to try and do better at all levels
 chunki asli samasya testing kii he, so raina kii duniya main koi sankat nahin
 At least there is no new crisis
 halaat 1986 main kharaab the or aaj bhi kharaab hai
 In the same context, Raina's recommendations seem to be that in the last three decades, any function of the education department could ever prepare them (and in fact it happened many times): invest more money in government schools; Have more teachers (but not contract); Give more training to teachers and do not let private schools dominate
 sari baton ko jodakar dekhen to saaf jaahir ho jaataa he ki isaki jaden kahaan hai: vinod raina kii mul phikr adhyaaapak hai, chaatr nahin
 They are ready to fight with everything that affects the teachers' influence and their salary
 isiilie ve or bahut saare duusare pratishthit visheshgy hameshaa shiksha kii dasha-disha kii vaarshik report or kul milakar saarvajanik parikshaon se baichaiyn rahe hai
 Why is the right to education not given the right to find out whether education is actually being given or not? The exam exposes teachers
 nirakshar mata-pita ko pataa lagata he ki unke bachche fail ho rahe hai
 This problem will be overcome by frequent and comprehensive evaluation as most of these parents will not understand any of this
 shikshakon kaa apana mahatv he
 The key to the success of any education initiative lies with them
 par skool vyavastha to bacchon ke hisaab se dizin honi chahie, na ki shikshakon ke hisaab se, unke liye bhi nahin, jo shikshakon ko padhaate hai or unke liye bhi nahin, jo paathyakram banaate hai, paathya pustaken likhte hai
 Priority should be given to those who help children in their studies

 Look carefully: Now they do not dismiss the ordinances as rubbish, instead they are making necessary laws from the government, increasing the number of subsidized cylinders and want to make women the Chief Minister

 Now we have started shaving too
 bharat ke liye unke sapane ab sirf vyavastha badalane vaale vichaaron kaa sangrah nahin hai, balki bhavishya kii yojana bhi hai kyonki congress agle chunaav main hone vaale nuksaan ko kam-se-kam karne kii ji-tod koshish kar rahi he
 He has promised that the election manifesto of Congress will not only mention the necessary reforms for education and health, but also what the UPA government will do to raise more employment and development
 congress kaarysmiti or akhil bhartiya congress cameti kii 16-17 janvari kii baithak main congressiyon ne us rahul ko dekha, jisaki ve arase se tamanna kar rahe the

 Rahul was happy working for a long battle
 ab tak rahul ne shaayad hi kabhi nehru-gandhi parivaar se aae desh ke teen pradhanmantriyon kaa hawala die bina koi bhaashan diya hoga
 The burden of history of ancestors was very heavy on his shoulders
 lekin unhone yah samajhane main bahut der kar di ki desh kaa mood sirf-upie sarkaar ke khilaaf nahin he, balki usne is parivaar se bhi munh mode liya he
 Under the leadership of the Congress, the government has become synonymous with policy bias on the one hand and corruption on the other
 bharat kii charchit vikaas gaatha itihaas kii pariktha ban gai lagati he, jisane rahul or unki party kii mushkilen badha deen
 At the same time, it also gave rise to the popularity of Narendra Modi
 vishaal prachaar tantra ke sahare faili gujarat model kii aandhi naakaam upie sarkaar ke liye sidhi chunauti ban gai
 Due to scams one by one, Arvind Kejriwal managed to grab the spot which Rahul wanted to occupy as anti-establishment
 aam aadmi party (aap) ke sanyojak kejariwal ke udai or disambar, 2013 main dilli vidhansabha ke chunaavon ne samasya kii najaakat ko or hawa de di

 urjavan rahulalekin dilli ke talkatoraa stadium main akhil bhartiya congress cameti kii baithak main rahul ne apane bhaashan se ummid se pare party main nai urja kaa sanchaar kar sabko vismit kar diya
 Rahul gave a befitting reply to the Bharatiya Janata Party's PM candidate Narendra Modi raising the slogan of "congress Mukt Bharat": "people of the opposition do not know history
" congress ek sanghathan nahin, balki soch he jo hamaare dil main he
 This is a thinking of brotherhood, love, respect
 (samraat) ashok kii yahi soch thi, guru nanak, (samraat) akbar, gandhi ji kii bhi yahi soch thi
 The same thinking is there in you, also in us
 yah soch hindustan main 3000 saal se chali aa rahi he
 "when Rahul said in a challenging tone," No one can erase this thinking from India, and the one who has tried to erase it has been erased "
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi adhiveshan kaa samaapan karte hue boleen, ‘‘kuch dinon se hamane khud ko chintaa main daal diya tha
 But today it became clear that if we decide then no power can defeat the Congress

 This cannot be avoided in politics, but we have to keep ourselves alive and move forward in changed circumstances
 ’’achaanak unke bhaashanon main khandaan kii bajaae bhartiya raajnneeti ke bahut sahame hue kirdaar aam aadmi kaa zikr hone laga he
 At the Talkatora Stadium, he said, "I am your soldier
 aap jo kaho, main karne ko taiyaar hum
 "in a completely changed and new way, Rahul spoke heartily in the session before the 2014 general election and while drawing a line decided that the new Congress of the 21st century has now come where internal democracy will be strengthened and the talk of youth Will be heard rahul ne 21 disambar ko fikki kii vaarshik aam baithak main udyog pramukhon se kaha, ‘‘aaj sabase bada mudda bhrashtachar he
 It is sucking the blood of the country like a leech
 upie sarkaar kii bahut aalochana hui he, lekin bhrashtachar rokane ke liye usne kisi bhi anya sarkaar se zyada kaam kiya he
 We have to fight corruption with full force and strong intention
 ’’ isse pehle 4 april, 2013 ko rahul ne nai dilli main siiai kii baithak main pramukh udyogpatiyon ko sambodhit kiya tha
 At that time, he compared India to the honeycomb, which became a joke on Twitter
 unhone kaha tha, ‘‘bharat ke log kisi na kisi baat kii shikaayat karte rahete hai
 The reason for their grievances is that they are facing very complex situations
 bharat jatil desh he, jabaki china saral he
 That is why India cannot provide easy answers to the questions of Western and other investors
 ’’siiai or fikki ke bhaashanon ke bich ek ke baad ek chunavi haar kii vajah se asaliyat saamne aa gai thi
 Rahul's vision was the clearest in FICCI
 unhone 21 disambar ko kaha, ‘‘bharat ke liye hamaara sapana aise desh kaa he, jisaki arthvyavastha duniya main sabase badi he
 Is no less than anyone
 ham duusari harith kranti ke dwaar par khadey hai
 High food prices and inflation are raising concerns
 ’’ rahul ke chaar si yani vishwaas (confidence), samvaad kii kshamta (communicator), samarpan (kamitment) or vichaaron main sangati (concystancy) na sirf desh ko ek nayaa netaa de sakate hai, balki nai congress ko khadaa kar sakate hai
 The way of dialogue changed till the person who was satisfied by identifying problems with introspection, has started giving solutions today
 rahul ab thos kaam karne lage hai
 Contacting different focus groups, Scheduled Castes, Tribes, Minorities and Youth
 8 disambar ko vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ne sabit kar diya ki chunaav maidan main congress dhul chaatane lagi he
 The party has since held three meetings on its manifesto
 party ke mahasachiv or communication cell ke pramukh ajay maakan kaa kahana he, ‘‘is maheene main is tarah kii do or baithken hone vaali hai
 "rahul's messages are more clear in these meetings
" talkatoraa stadium main 17 janvari ko aatmavishvaas se labarej rahul ne kaha, ‘‘ab aap (janata) jo kahenge, ghoshnaptr main vahi shaamil hoga or jo ghoshnaptr main shaamil hoga use sarkaar puraa karke dikhaaegi
 "rahul realizes that Congressmen are unable to redeem their achievements
" unhone kaha, ‘‘vipaksh kii marketing bahut acchhee he
 They (BJP) also sell comb to Ganj
 ab unamem nae log (aap) aae hai jo ganjon ko hair kating de rahe hai
 In this way, he simultaneously targeted Narendra Modi and Arvind Kejriwal
 acshan hero modi or aam aadmi kejariwal ke bich fanse rahul khud ko kuch karne vaale or baat karne ko taiyaar netaa ke rup main pesh kar rahe hai
 In the last six weeks, Rahul has started to communicate more than before
 nau saal tak ve press se bachate rahe
 Now they are giving interviews
 tairaaki or akido jaise apane shauk jaahir kar rahe hai
 He recently told a Hindi newspaper, "there is no word like inattention in my life
" ’’nai piaar ranneeti ke jaankaar sutara ne india today ko bataaya, ‘‘unhen aisi baton par zyada bolne kii salaah di gai he, jinase acchhee bahes ho
 Every day they should be seen setting the news agenda of the day
 uskaa nishaanaa nahin bananaa chahie
 "now Rahul's complexion has completely changed
 ve sahaj hokar baat karte hai
 The angry youngman of politics has become Kejriwal, so Rahul is looking more comfortable and more eager to listen
 21 disambar ko fikki kaa bhaashan ho yaa 27 disambar ko congressi mukhyamantriyon ke saath samvaadadaata sammelan, ve pehle se zyada muskaraae
 Kurta-pajamas have been replaced by kurtas and jeans
 pichley kai chunaavon se rahul daawa karte rahe hai ki congress ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa jaldi kar di jaaegi, lekin party aisa nahin kar pai
 Now for the first time they have formed a screening committee consisting of 10 panels to select candidates from different states
 inamen unke vishwast log (dekhen box) hai, taaki tikat unheen ko milen, jinhen ve bhavishya main congress kii bagdor thamana chaahate hai
 According to a committee member, "this will be the first time that the District Congress and block committees will recommend candidates on the basis of popularity at the grassroots level
" ’’ rahul ne janata se judye kii yojana banaai he
 He said at the Talkatora Stadium that in 15 parliamentary constituencies, people will elect candidates under the pilot project, officials and workers will vote and choose
 rahul ne samiti kii pehali baithak 10 janvari ko bulaai
 The Congress headquarters 24, Akbar Road was surrounded by the SPG even before his arrival that evening, only photographers and camera crews were allowed to come to the meeting place, but Rahul came to the cameras and said, '' For the first time, this work is being done formally and with time frame
 hamane rajnatik dal ke bheetar ek vyavastha or prakriya apanaai he or ham dhire-dhire apni party ke bheetar janata kii aawaaj laaenge
 “time has shown that time is short
 sapane dekhnaa band karnaa hoga
 The one who does something, now has to show it
 unke bheetar kii yah chatapataahat ab neeche tak pahunch gai he
 In state units of the Congress, generational change has begun in the State Congress Committees
 ab unke kuch pramukh saathi samitiyon ke adhyaksh ban gaye hai
 On 13 January, 36-year-old Sachin Pilot was made President of Rajasthan Pradesh Congress and 39-year-old Arun Yadav, who was Congress Secretary, was sent to Madhya Pradesh

 One such Congress leader said, "we are waiting for the departure order
 ’’ ek congressi netaa kehete hai ki ab ve apane loksabhaa kshetra ke zyada chakkar lagane lage hai
 According to a senior party leader, Rahul made many more changes in the organization in recent times
 pichley saal upaadhyaksh banane ke baad se unhone pradesh adhyakshon or vidhayak dal netaaon kii timahi samiksha shuru kii he
 The action of review meetings is recorded, goals are set and monitored
 congress shasit rajyon main ghoshnaptr kriyanvayan samitiyaan hai, jo rajya sarkaar ke pradarshan par najar rakhti hai
 It is not enough to just make promises, they need to be implemented
 congress main har sahi kaam kaa shrey rahul ko dena party kii puraani aadat he, jo kabhi kaamyaab nahin hui, kyonki aadhe-adhure upaay apanaae jate rahe
 Worse than that, Rahul used to disappear every time he took the initiative
 july, 2011 main jab kisaanon ne sarkari bhoomi adhigrahan kaa virodh kiya to rahul teen din pashchimi uttar pradesh main paidal chale lekin is pad yatra ko bhunaane main naakaam rahe
 When the youth came out on the streets in Anna Hazare's Lokpal movement, Rahul disappeared for a long time
 26 agast, 2011 ko hajaare ke anshan ke 11wein din ve achaanak sansad main is vishay par bole ki lokapal ko sanvaidhanik sanstha banaaya jaae or ek bill paas karne se kuch nahin badalegaa
 On his way out of Parliament that day, he told reporters that his speech "will change the whole game"
 ’’ rahul kii is atmaprashansa se party ke baahar bahut kam log sahamat the
 Now this bill has become law and the party is loudly claiming that it was possible only on the insistence of Rahul
 farvari main sansad kaa satr phir hone par un vidheyakon par vichaar hoga, jinhen rahul ne bhrashtachar ke khilaaf apana hathiyaar bataaya he or upie sarkaar jinhen paas karaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 These include the Whistle Blower Protection Bill, the Judicial Standards and Responsibility Bill, the anti-corruption Law Amendment Bill, the Citizen Charter and the Government Procurement Bill
 rahul dikhaa rahe hai ki ve raajnneeti ke maidan main date rahenge or adhyadesh ko bakawaas bataanaa unke lambey khel kaa hissaa tha
 (rahul Gandhi during the Youth Congress rally in Kayamkulam, Kerala in the beginning of the year) Here i am! During the discussion on Lokpal Bill, Rahul did raise some issues, which have to be resolved in these bills, but the last two In the year, he did not make any special effort to get the bill passed
 ab chunaav sir par hai to vigyaapan udyog ke sutron ke mutabik congress paanch sau karod ru
 Is thinking about playing an advertisement game, which has been given to Dentsu India
 vigyapanon main upie kii uplabdhiyon ke saath rahul ko bhrashtachar virdohi tantra ke liye jor lagane vaale yoddha ke rup main ubhaara jayega
 Based on the PR companies' presentation, Rahul has entrusted the responsibility of the party's social media campaign to Genesis burson-marsler in the election
 maakan pichley kuch dinon se din-raat in donon agenciyon ke saath prachaar ke pramukh muddon par charchaa kar rahe hai
 It is said that she has received Priyanka Gandhi's approval

 The slogan of an advertisement is - Rahulji's nine weapons, will remove corruption

 The second advertisement mentions Rahul Gandhi's dream of corruption-free India
 congress ke vigyapanon main 2005 main kanoon bane soochna adhikaar adhinium (artiai) kaa shrey rahul ko diya gaya he, jinhone usee samay raajnneeti main kadam rakhaa tha
 When Prime Minister Manmohan Singh started the new year by accepting the government's failure in the matter of corruption and unemployment in his press conference on 3 January, Rahul took credit for all the successes of the UPA and avoided what went wrong
 badlaav kii baat karnaa use laane se zyada aasaan he
 The dynasty, which runs the world's largest democratic party Congress, has always been described as the glue that keeps the party together
 aaj haalat yah he ki khandaan ko party ko ekajute rakhane kii jarurat he
 The mood of the country has never been against the Gandhi family
 tab se to kabhi nahin jab 15 saal se bhi pehle sonia gandhi ne party kii kaman sanbhali thi or party par ek baar phir khandaan kaa kabja hua tha
 Looking at the election results of the last two years, it seems that the party has got used to losing
 congress ne 16 main se 12 vidhansabha chunaav haare hai or 1974 se sirf 583 siten jiti hai
 But the upcoming Lok Sabha election has become a battle for the survival of the family
 nae bharat ke liye ‘‘rahul drushti’’upie-2 main ab tak congress ko bhrashtachar or bedam shashan ke aaropon se saans lene kii fursat nahin mil rahi thi
 The functioning of the government was also not being discussed
 rahul gandhi ab is baat ko lekar aakraamak hai ki sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon ko janata tak le jaaya jaae
 They want party leaders and activists to tell the public that the Congress has ushered in an era of rights in India, including the right to information, the right to education and the right to food for hunger
 chunaav prachaar ke aguva ke taur par rahul kii yah jimmedaari he ki ve party kaa sandesh logon tak pahunchaaen
 Rahul tried to stop the vote bank which is moving towards AAP and BJP
 rahul ne 14 karod logon ko bipiel se baahar nikaalane kii baat kahi to unhone yah bhi bataaya ki desh main 70 karod kii aabaadi aisi he jo garibi rekha ke upar he, lekin madhyam varg se neeche he
 Rahul assured the lower middle class that in the next five years, the Congress would make this section stand in the middle class line
 rahul aadhikarik taur par congress kii ore se pradhanmantri ummidavaar nahin banaae gaye, lekin unhone sanket de diya ki agali baar party kii sarkaar bani to vahi bagdor sanbhaalenge
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh hopes, "there will be new energy under Rahul's leadership
" mujhe shaq nahin ki 2014 main rahul ke netritv vaale chunaav abhiyaan main hamen puri kamyaabi milegi
 "in a completely changed and new way, Rahul spoke heartily in the session before the 2014 general election and while drawing a line decided that the new Congress of the 21st century has now come where internal democracy will be strengthened and the talk of youth Will be heard rahul gandhi badal rahe hai lekin kya ve 128 saal puraani us party ko badal paaenge, jisane jeetne kii ichha tyaag di thi
 Before winning the hearts of the people of the country, Rahul must win the hearts of the people of his party

 com / jrmin7hnrs— Shreya Ghoshal (@shreyaghoshal)february 6, 2015 The two big companies of the world, Apple and Samsung, rival each other
 aipal ne haal hi main iphone 8 or iphone 8 Plus ke saakh iphone x bhi launch kiya he
 This smartphone is in a way the rival of Samsung's flagship smartphones Galaxy Note 8 and Galaxy S8
 lekin iphoen x kii bikri se bhi samsung kaa phayda hoga
 According to the teardown report, some parts of Samsung have been installed in the iphone X
 isamen do part samsung ke hai- bydaree or oled disple
 That is, Samsung's earnings from OLED display and battery will be considerable
 jitna zyada iphone x bikega utana phayda samsung ko bhi hoga
 Reports have claimed that Samsung will earn around $ 110 (rs 7,220) on every iphone x from these two components installed in the iphone X
 jaahir he aipal kaa yah khaas smartphone he or isliye hi bharat main iphone 8 or iphone 8 Plus kii shuruyaat feeki rahi he
 This means that the worldwide iphone x is waiting and its sales are also expected to be high
 aipal ke anumaan ke mutabik iphone x ke 130 million units beche ja sakate hai
 Significantly, Samsung has been offering OLED displays in its flagship smartphones for a long time
 lekin aipal ne pehali baar iphone x main OLED panel yuj kiya he
 Although Apple has still used LCD display in iphone 8 and 8 Plus
 isi technology kii vajah se iphone x main bejal les age tu age disple diya gaya he
 According to The Wall Street Journal, Samsung will gain $ 110 on every iphone x sold
 aapako bataa den ki yah phayda samsung electronics ko nahin hoga jo Galaxy smartfones banaati he, jabaki yah phayda samsung ke doosraa arm ko hoga
 Because Samsung has many businesses, one of which is Samsung Electronics which deals in handsets
 wal street jarnal kaa anumaan he ki iphone x se hone vaali kamai 4 billian dollar se bhi zyada ho sakati he jo Galaxy S8 ke parts nirmaan karne se bhi zyada he
 Since currently only OLED display is made by Samsung, Apple does not have any other option
 iske alaava DRAM chip or NAND flash bhi samsung banaati he jisaki jarurat aipal ko apane iphone ke liye hoti he

 Suresh Ranane, an important batsman of the middle order of India's limited overs team, has said that when he scored the first century in international cricket, he was praised by the former players which was a memorable moment in his career

 It was a memorable moment for me
 'raina ne kaha, 'isse bhi badhkar jab agle hi din sachin tendulkar ne mujhe poocha ki chalo dinar karke aate hai, to yah mere liye yaadgaar lamhaa tha
 "when Raina was asked about the tour before leaving for Bangladesh for the ODI series, he said," Bangladesh did well in the recent World Cup and also against Pakistan
 unke khilaadi yuva hai or sabhi acha pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Just like our players are doing well in IPL, their players are doing well in BPL
 'suresh raina ne kaha, 'kisi bhi pratidwandvi ke khilaaf khelnaa aasaan nahin hota
 They have played a lot of matches against us and they know what our potential is and we know what their potential is

 The BJP has suffered a big loss in Saurashtra, which is considered a strong stronghold of Patidar
 congress ko bijepi se zyada siten mili he
 The BJP has suffered the loss of the Patidars' resentment, while Hardik Patel has the advantage of being with the Congress
 bataa den ki saurashtra patidaar bahulya kshetra he
 Saurashtra plays a very important role in Gujarat's politics
 rajya kii 182 vidhansabha siton main se 54 siten is kshetra se aati hai
 Congress has benefited in this area
 congress ko 29 siten mili he
 Whereas BJP has got 25 seats
 jabaki pichley 2012 ke chunaav main 35 siten bijepi ko or 16 congress or 3 anya ko mili thi
 Rahul Gandhi started his Gujarat election campaign from the Saurashtra region
 unhone dwarkadhish mandir se rahul ne gujarat main navasrujan yatra shuru kiya tha
 BJP came to power through Saurashtra

 In the last 2012 assembly elections, the bjp's mood in Saurashtra remained intact
 saurashtra ke patidaaron ne keshubhai patel ko nakaara diya tha
 Saurashtra remained in favor of the BJP as long as Gujarat was in the hands of Narendra Modi
 modi saurashtra main sabase taqatvar poster boy rahe hai
 But this time the BJP has suffered a big loss in Saurashtra

 This study has shown that people are prejudiced against names that seem to be native
 kai pravasi apni marji se apana naam badalakar kuch aisa rakh lete hai jisase ve nae samudaay main khud ko zyada feet maan saken
 According to a study published in the journal 'social Psychological and Personality Science', changing native names to English is less likely to reduce prejudice against migrants

 a goal from Barcelona captain Carles Puyol added a new chapter to their football history by making it to the final of the FIFA World Cup for the first time with a 1-0 win over three-time champions Germany here

 Strikers such as Germany's Miroslove Klose and Lucas Podolski were blunt, while second-placed FIFA rankings Spain, led by David Villa, adopted an attacking stride from early in the 73rd minute
 tab main aaf da match jhaavi ke baayin taraf se liye gayi carnor par puol ne joardaar header se gend jaali main uljhaayi jo baad main nirnaayak gol sabit hua
 It is also a coincidence that Spain had also beaten Germany 1–0 in the final of the 2008 European Championships, while they had won this World Cup in their last two matches of the knockout round by the same margin
 in donon match main uski taraf se vila ne gol kiye the
 Spain is only the second team in the history of the World Cup to win three consecutive matches 1–0 to advance to the finals
 usase pehle 2002 main germany ne yah karnama kiya tha
 Not only this, it will be the first time in the World Cup when none of the teams from Brazil, Argentina, Germany or Italy have reached the final
 iske saath hi spain duusari aisi team ban gayi jo europea champion hone ke saath final main pahunchane main kaamyaab rahi
 American writer Henry James has said, 'to create even a small part of literature, one has to study a large part of history
 ' lekin aaj ke lekhakon ke paas itnaa samay he kya? yah sawaal 2015 main puri tarah chaaya rahaa
 In 2015, a large Hindi literary group appeared to be in a hurry
 vah jald likhakar jald surkhiyaan luutane kii jugat main thi
 Hence, it was seen trying to give Hindi a new genre with the help of social networking
 nateezaah jhatpat sahitya
 Literature that was written for itself, said about itself and associated with narcissism
 jise bhaavon ke jowar uthne par ek jatke main likhaa gaya
 Hindi publishers were also involved in instant literature
 puraa seen kathy se zyada kathy kehane waalon par rijhane vaala ho gaya
 That is, the emphasis was on creating literature that relied more on the reach of social networking sites, less on the ability and narrative of the author
 yah sab tab ho rahaa tha jab videshi sahitya main str or vaishishty donon kaa khyaal rakhaa ja rahaa tha
 Books like Harper Lee's Go Set a Watchman, Milan Kundera's' The Festival of Insignificance 'and Mario Vargas' Laosa's' The Discreet Hero' appeared on the world stage

 On the other hand, ever since Vishwanath Tripathi has taken up a pen to write his past, he has been giving fantastic books one by one
 vah chaahe 'nangatlai kaa gaanv' ho yaa phir 'vyomakesh darvesh'
 His memoir book 'guruji ki kheti bari' this year is also excellent
 unke alaava vandana raag kaa kahani sangrah 'hizrat se pehle', dasharath maanjhi kii jindagi par nilay upaadhyaay kaa upanyaas 'pahaad', nikhil sachaan kii 'jindagi aais-paais' (kahani sangrah), sanjeev kaa upanyaas 'fans', satya vyas kaa upanyaas 'banaras tokies' or shashikant mishra kaa 'non resident bihari' (upanyaas) pathneey hai
 Ramesh Kuntal Megh's 'vishwamithkasaritsagar' is a brilliant work done with very hard work

 At the same time, Bhalchandra Nemade's novel 'hindu: The Prosperous Junkyard' of Marathi, which came from Marathi to Hindi, has done the work of compensation

 The book 'prem Squirrel Heart Hazel' by young poet Babusha Kohli is amazing in its mood

 The language of Babusha comes with a new feature, equipped with the latest untouched experiments

 The specialty of this section is that most of the books in it are translated from English
 amish treepathi kii 'ikshvaku ke vanshaj' bikri ke maamle main teji banaae hue he, jabaki chetan bhagat kii 'half garlfriend' ne bhi thik-thaak kiya or surendra mohan pathak to jab se harper ke saath aae hai unki kitabon kii rich or bad gai he
 This year's hit is 'goa Galata'
 devdatt patnayak ne 'shikhandi' ke jariye mithology par apane kaam ko or aage badhaayaa he
 It is necessary to mention the books of former President APJ Abdul Kalam here because his popularity among young readers is maintained
 hindi main jo chahen prayog karen lekin german lekhak johaan volfgong won goethe kii is baat ko nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki 'sahitya kaa patan hi kisi raashtra ke patan kaa sabab he
 So, let's hope that 2016 will be a slightly different year

 bihar main argedy-algepi or congress ke mahagathbandhan par bikharane ke asaar dikhne lage hai
 In the matter of the RJD-LJP and the Congress's grand alliance, which is going on in Bihar, Ram Vilas Paswan's neglect, the party is going on exasperatingly
 seat bantwaare par paswan ko lalu kaa formula bhi katai manjuur nahin he saath hi lalu or unke netaaon ke bol bhi paswan ko ab nagavar guzar rahe hai to kya is gathbandhan se paswan alag ho jaaenge, ye sawaal phir khadaa hone laga he
 Rama Singh from Ara, Surajbhan Singh from Nawada, these are the two seats that Lalu is not willing to give up this time
 paswan ko lalu kaa ishaara hi kaaphi tha
 However, Paswan has not yet openly spoken against the alliance, but his displeasure is becoming clearer
 lalu yadav ne kaha ki is baar yahaan se criminal ko seat nahin denge or ye ramvilas paswan ko chubh gaya
 The criminal whom Lalu was talking about not giving ticket was actually a gesture of Paswan to give up the claim on the seats (ara and Nawada) that Paswan had taken from Lalu Yadav last time
 algepi supremeo ramvilas paswan ne kaha, 'koi saaf pikchar najar nahin aa rahaa he, laluji or tamaam netaaon kaa bayaan aa rahaa he ki sabhi secular takaton ko ek saath aana chahie lekin kaise aegi, usapar jo baatcheet honi chahie wo shuru hi nahin hui he
 When we and the RJD are not in talks, then how will they be with the Congress
 ’jail se baahar aate hi lalu yadav ne pehle to daagiyon or criminals ko tikat naa dene kii baat kar ramvilas paswan ko ishaara kar diya ki wo is baar unki nahin sunenge
 Also, other party leaders made it clear that whichever party it is, it will get a ticket according to its location
 paswan kii naaraazgi ke baavjood argedy ke bade netaa algepi ko zyada tarjeeh dene ke mood main nahin hai
 Senior party leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said, 'show your candidate first and the candidate who will be able to fight will be fought
 ye nahin hoga ki seat lekar ummidavaar khojate phiren
 They will have fighters, show as many wrestlers and take seats
 par seat lekar aadmi khojenge aisa is baar ye nahin chalegaa
 'in the last Lok Sabha election, Lalu had given 12 seats to Paswan bypassing the Congress and the LJP lost all those seats
 andarkhaane kii khabaron ke mutabik is baar bhi paswan utani hi siton kii ummid kar rahe the lekin lalu is baar mahagathbandhan banane kii baat kar paswan ko chaar se zyada siten dene par raji nahin hai
 In such a situation, Paswan has questioned the alliance
 ab dekhnaa ye hoga ki kya paswan is gathbandhan main rahete hai yaa phir nitish kaa daaman thamte hai

 Raw mangoes are not eaten directly, eaten with salt

 koi chusane kii bajaae chabaae to use alag swaad mili
 The ordinary candy is finished in 50 seconds, but the pulse of the pulse dissolves thereafter to give a different enjoyment

 This was the first candy of one rupee
 isse pehle sabhi candi 50 paise kii bikati thim

 Rajiv tells him something like this: “after Partition, people started traveling more in the country and it was not possible for the paan eaters to take a drink every time
 lihaaja kuch aisa chahie tha jo paan kii jarurat puri kar sake
 Because of this, pan masala started as a cottage industry in Kanpur
 usee kadi main 1976 main hamane bhi tansen naam se paan masaale kaa ek brand utaara
 Different is of tone and test but not everyone likes its taste
 vah zyada kaamyaab na hua
 After that, many formulas were made and tested for 5-6 years

 Now talk about DS Group's kitchen products
 iskaa kaich namak yun hi shauk-shauk main taiyaar hua
 Rajeev says, "when we used to eat food, salt often used to freeze with moisture
 bade bhai or chairman ravinder kumaar ke dimag main aayaa ki aisa namak kyon na taiyaar kiya jaae jo dibbi se aaraam se nikle
 "just catch salt ready
 iske liye namak ko khaas taur par process kiya jaataa he
 Its technology was brought from abroad and it was given in rotary top packing
 namak ke saath chaat masala or kaali mirch ke teble top pack taiyaar kiye gaye
 Then there was a demand from dealers that customers also ask about other products like Chana Masala and Garam Masala of the company

 rajeev bataate hai, ''hamane saunf, ilaychi, brahmi ke saath khajur jaise natural sweetner se taiyaar shpaas-pasy bazaar main utaara
 However, its formulation was also changed many times in terms of food safety
 bazaar main isaki koi sau se zyada nakal maujuud hai lekin quality ke dam par hamaara product aaj bhi bejod he
 Our product users do not get that satisfaction in others
 yahi vajah he ki bazaar main hamen koi khaas chunauti nahin milti

 The company meets 99 percent of its investment needs with its own resources

 sarkaar bhi kai maheenon se ansuna kar rahi thi
 Continued to implement small changes but did not pay attention to the main demands
 sab maan chuke hai ki gujarat main bijepi kii vijay nishchit he
 There is no agar in it
 main bhi maanata hum
 Then what happened that the government which was not listening to businessmen across the country suddenly started listening? Right, scared, scared and ruined traders have benefited from the Gujarat election
 vaise chunaav ayog kii aachaar samhita kaa achaar pad gaya he
 Now this institution must be forgotten
 itane bade paimaane par rate cat hue hai
 Earlier, you could not reduce the price of petrol during elections
 kair, ham sab sansthaaon ko dhahte hue dekh rahe hai
 One day you will pay its price
 vyapaariyon ko sochna chahie ki unhen dar kyon lag rahaa tha? ve ro rahe the magar kyon bol nahin paa rahe the? aisa isile hua kyonki ve samarthak or bhakthi main khud ko dhaal kar apni shakti ganvaa chuke the
 They were also involved in this game for a long time, whoever questions the government, abuse it
 unhen pataa nahin tha ki ve kya kar rahe hai
 They were joining the abuses and ending the space to raise their voice in democracy, whose first initiative he suffered first and foremost
 chah maheene main kitna nuksaan hua hoga
 They were finding that the dock media would not support them
 aayega to sarkaar kii agenciyon ke dar se ve bolne ke laayak bhi nahin rahe
 The lesson is that you must like a party, vote again or again, even if you do, you preserve the voter's status
 gujarat chunaav kaa bhay nahin hota to unki maangen kabhi nahin maani jaatin
 They have the power to speak as long as they are voters, citizens
 jaise hi ve bhakt or samarthak main badalte hai, shaktiviheen ho jate hai
 Then, on expressing dissatisfaction, they will be called rebels
 loktantr main asantosh zaahir karne kaa adhikaar har kisi ke paas hona chahie
 If the business class had already behaved like a voter, then your business would not have lost lakhs
 tippaniyan The second lesson for businessmen is that when someone questions the government, they support him
 aaj ke daur main sawaal karnaa aasaan nahin he
 The job is even at stake
 koi sawaal kiske liye karata he
 What if two or four people like us do not write on GST? Therefore, protect those who question
 varanaa ek din jab fansenge to aapaki baat kehane vaala koi nahin hoga
 You know that the listener does not care what you are saying by reaching power
 vipaksh kii awaz, sawaal karne kii parampara kaa saath dijie, uskaa bachaav kiijie varanaa maukey kaa laabh uthaa kar rakshak hi bhakshak ban jayega
 It was already made
 godi media ne vyapaariyon kii awaz ko dabaaya
 Traders too started to feel this
 isliye un sabhi patrakaron ko badhai jinaki jiesti kii barbaadi kii khabar bhale hi andar ke panne par or kahin kone main chhapi
 Traders should wonder why they felt scared? They were crying but why were they unable to speak? This happened because they had lost their power by molding themselves into supporters and devotion
 ve bhi lambey samay tak is khel main shaamil the ki jo bhi sarkaar par sawaal kare, use gaali do
 They had no idea what they were doing
 ve gaaliyon main shaamil hokar loktantr main awaz uthaane ke spes ko khatm kar rahe the jiskaa sabase pehle or sabase zyaada nuksaan unheen ko uthaanaa padaa
 What a loss it must have been in six months
 unhen pataa chal rahaa tha ki godi media unka saath nahin degaa
 They will not be able to speak due to fear of government agencies
 sabak yahi he ki aap zarur ek party ko pasand karen, baar-baar vot karen yaa kisi ko ek baar bhi karen to bhi aap matadaata kii haisiyat ko bachaae rakhie
 If the Gujarat election was not feared, their demands would never have been met
 jab tak ve matadaata hai, naagarik hai tabhi tak unke paas bolne kii shakti he
 As they turn into devotees and supporters, they become powerless
 tab asantosh zaahir karne par baagi qaraar die jaaenge
 Everyone should have the right to express dissatisfaction in democracy
 agar vyapaaree varg pehle se hi voter kii tarah vyavhaar karte to aapke bijness ko lakhon kaa ghaataa na hota
 The comments vyapaariyon ke liye doosraa sabak yah he ki jab koi sarkaar se sawaal kare, to uskaa saath den
 Today's question is not easy to question

 Excerpt courtesy of publisher Hind Pair: 'october Junction', ten years ago
 oktober 2010, banarasabnaras shahar sach or sapane ke bich main kahin basataa he
 In Benaras no one can understand what is true and what is dream
 koi yahan sach dhundne aata he to koi sapana bhuulane, lekin banaras ek dheeth shahar he
 It turns people's truth into a dream and makes the dream look like a reality
 banaras ke chauraahon par zindagi ke myne gol-gol ghoomte rahete hai koi pakad letaa he to koi khaali haath laut jaataa he
 The city is a bit moody, does not open to everyone and does not open to everyone
 baat thodi gahari he koi samaj jaae to thik nahin to jai bhole nath!ab kisi bhi kahani main koi ladkaa or koi ladki kahin-na-kahin to milte hai
 Wherever any boy and girl can be found in the world, everything has been written
 college se lekar offis tak, train se lekar hawaii jahaaj tak
 Since both Chitra and Sudeep had to meet somewhere
 isliye sudeep or chitra assi ghat par milte hai
 The two would never have met if the Pizzeria Cafe had not been crowded at the time
 bheed itani zyada thi ki pizgeria ke waiter ne in donon ko ek saath baitha diya
 However, both wanted me-time
 donon hi akele baithna chaahate the lekin itani bheed main alag puraa teble milanaa mushkil tha
 So both had to sit together
 donon khadey nahin rahanaa chaahate the
 This story would not have started if that waiter had not made these two sit in the circle of expanding their business
 is kahani main waiter kaa kaam itnaa hi tha
 Now he will never come back after taking his order
 aapane kabhi sochaa he, roj tamaam kahaniyaan aise hi ve log shuru karte hai jinako kabhi pataa hi nahin chalata ki ve kahani kaa kitna ahm hissaa hai
 Sudeep's age is around 25 years
 usne cajual kaali tii-shart or neeli genes pahani hui he
 Chitra's age is 26-27 years
 chitra ne short kurta or neeli genes pahani hui he
 Slowly you will know who these two are
 abhi jaanane laayak bas itnaa he ki donon ek saath cafe kii teble par hai
 Both have ordered a pizza and lemon honey water
 'log banaras kyon aate hai?''kyon kaa pataa nahin lekin ye pataa he ki kab aate hai
 "when does it come?" When there is no way forward
 'ye sawaal-jawaab sudeep or chitra bhi ek-duusare se kar sakate the
 But this question was raised by two people sitting at the table immediately behind Sudeep and Chitra
 un donon kii aawaaj in donon ko sunai padi
 If these two people had not asked this question on that day, then this story probably would not have started
 peeche vaali teble par baithe un do ajanabiyon kii baat sunakar chitra ne kaha, 'haau tru!''kahan atak gai hai aap! sori, shaayad mujhe nahin poochna chahie
 'sudeep said
 'it’s okay, main apni kitaab main ek jagah atak gai hoon' kahani aage hi nahin bad rahi' yahan biechayu main ek kavita kaa event tha
 If there was an invitation from there, i thought maybe everybody gets salvation in Benaras, maybe i can get the story
 tum banaras kyon aae ho?' chitra ne peeche kii teble par baithe logon kii baat sunne kii naakaam koshish karte hue poocha
 'I had a friend's wedding and had heard a lot about Banaras'
 i wanted to come here for many years
 
 "how did you feel, Benares?" It was not yet heard as yet
 ''kitne din se aae ho?''ek din ho gaya
 Friend had a wedding yesterday
 ''banaras chadhane main time lagata he
 'chitra said
 'sori, main samajha nahin
 "if you come for two days, Banaras will never feel good
" banaras aao to fursat se aao
 There are many people coming to Banaras but few people get access
 ''tumhaari ye aakhri line mere upar se guzar gai, lekin ek baat bataao zyada din rukne se banaras badal thode jayega?''wel, main bas itnaa boluungi, do din se zyada rukkar dekho tab ye sawaal nahin poochhoge
 'then pizza arrived
 donon ne apana-apana pizza khaanaa shuru kiya
 Sudeep started watching the college kids sitting near the ghat eating pizza
 wo bachche shaayad banaras hindu uniwarsity ke arts college ke the
 They were sitting on the ghat and sketching the ghat
 kuch logon ko pataa bhi nahin tha ki unka ek hissaa kisi anjaan ladke ke sketch main kaid ho gaya he
 We will never know how many parts of us are imprisoned in the world
 donon aadha pizza khaane tak kuch nahin bole
 As the crowd was so crowded, the waiter tried to fit one or two people at the table of Sudeep and Chitra
 chitra ne waiter se kaha ki ek-do log or aa rahe hai
 The waiter also knew Chitra is lying
 chitra aaraam se baithna chaahati thi
 'look, pizza is half left
 agar maine jaldi kha liya to waiter jane ke liye bolegaa
 i want to sit here for a while
 tab tak time paas ke liye tum apane bare main kuch kyon nahin bataate?'sudeep chitra kii yah baat sunakar hansaa
 'amazing! Nobody talks to me like this
 vaise time paas ke liye tum apane bare main kuch kyon nahin bataati?''pucho
 "city?" Meaning the city, where i am or where i live
 mostli logon ke do shahar hote hai
 One where we are and one where we live
 ''jahaan tum rahati ho
 ''delhi
 or tumhaara?''mumbai
 And where are you from? ”bhopal
 or tum
 ''lucknow
 ''vaise ye shahar vaale sawaalon se to tum boring-si naukari karne vaale emb tip lag rahe ho?''tum jaj kar rahi ho mujhe?''haan, kar rahi hoon
 Now tell me something good, tell a lie, it should be fun
 ''maine 12th ke baad padhai nahin kii
 '' What! are you serious? '' 100% serious
 ''ye hui na baat, phir karte kya ho?''main itnaa kuch khaas nahin karata
 i have hired people to do it
 ''dheel kya di tum to phenkane hi lage
 But at least it is not boring
 ab tum pucho
 "why do you want to write a book?" Again boring question, no one knows why he wants to write the book
 ''phir bhi koi to vajah hogi?''mujhe nahin pataa kyon likhnaa chaahati hoon
 Probably for the name-fame
 ab meri baari
 ''ask
 ''naam kya he tumhaara?''ab tum boring sawaal poochne lagi
 "I can ask a boring question
" ''sudeep yadav
 '' One minute, one minute
 sudeep yadav to suna hua naam he
 "what's your company name?" Then boring question
 ''are bataao
 '' Book My Trip
 ''to tum ‘da’ sudeep yadav ho!''haan, sudeep yadav hoon
 i didn't know before the name was De Lag Gaye Hai
 khaskar jab koi itnaa acha pizza kha rahaa ho tab to meri baat bilkul bhi nahin kerani chahie
 'sudeep said keeping a piece of pizza in his plate
 'maine paper main padhaa he tumhaare bare main
 But i do not understand this startup and so on
 ''main akhbaar nahin padhata
 There is no time like this
 ''to tumhen pataa kaise chalata he ki aas-paas kya chal rahaa he?' chitra ne apane pizza kaa aakhri pis khate hue poocha
 'my assistant sends me a report of news of my work from all newspapers
 ''to jis sudeep yadav ke paas bilkul bhi time nahin he wo yahan banaras main baithkar aaraam se pizza kha rahaa he or main usase koi phaltu-si boring baat kar rahi hoon
 "told you, i came to a friend's wedding and then i took a break for three days too
" ''brake kisalie?''mere doctor ne dawa ke saath chuttee bhi presscrib kii thi
 i thought if i made a plan for Benares, stop here
 ''hua kya he tumhen?''tum zyada hi personal nahin ho rahi! riter kab se jarnlist tip sawaal poochne lage?' sudeep ne apana pizza khatm kiya' waiter ab inaki teble par ghaat lagaae baitha tha
 Sorry, but if Sudeep Yadav hits a table like this, a little excitement is made
 ''main jhooth bol rahaa tha
 i am not Sudeep Yadav
 na hi meri koi company he
 i have an MBA and i work in a normal C-job
 sudeep yadav ke bare main artical padhaa tha kabhi, bas aaj mauka dekhakar phenk diya
 'chitra did not understand whether the boy sitting in front was telling the truth or lying
 'aarti shuru hone ko he
 Nice to meet you, Miss Writer
 ''chitra pathak naam he meraa or tumhaara?''kya fark padataa he, maan lo sudeep yadav hi he
 After completing your book, send it to me
 company kii website par meraa adress he
 Sudeep went to see Aarti
 vahaan vah un bacchon ke sketch kaa hissaa ho gaya
 Chitra paid her bill
 vah bhi ghat par aarti dekhne baith gai
 She could see Sudeep but from the side she was sitting, Sudeep could not see her
 aarti ke bich-bich main chitra sudeep kii taraf dekh rahi thi
 After a while, Sudeep had gone up from where he was sitting
 chitra ne ek-do minute tak usko aas-paas dekhne kii koshish kii lekin vah dikhaa nahin
 Every incomplete meeting brings the expectation of a complete meeting
 har puri mulaaqaat agali puri mulaaqaat se pehle kii adhuri mulaaqaat banakar rah jaati he
 There is only an unfulfilled hope with which we do not grow old even though we are old
 kisi buudhe aashiq ne marane se thik pehle kaha tha ki ek chhataak bhar ummid par saali itani badi duniya tik sakati he to marane ke baad duusari duniya main uski ummid baandhakar to mar hi saktaa hoon
 Expecting older people should be heard
 acchhee lagati hai, bas unpar yakeen nahin karnaa chahie
 But where do all these things make sense in an age! Had Chitra not expected, she would have done everything she did
 chitra vahaan jaakar baith gai jahaan sudeep baitha hua tha
 He Google the name Sudeep Yadav on his mobile
 yah vahi sudeep yadav tha jiske bare main chitra ne thodaa-bahut sun rakhaa tha
 Chitra once again looked around but he did not show anywhere
 aarti khatm karke vah apane kamare main aa gai
 He opened his laptop and wrote a page
 thodi der main laptop band kiya or apni choti-si ek notebook main kuch likhane lagi
 In a short time she became bored with him
 usne hotel ke kamare kaa tivi on kiya
 The song 'dil To Bachcha Hai Ji' was playing on TV
 lite of karke vah nahaane chali gai
 When she returned to take a bath, 'munni Badnaam Hui' was playing on TV
 usne tivi band kiya or sone kii koshish karne lagi
 On the other hand, Sudeep asked for updates at the reception as soon as he entered the Taj Hotel
 resepshan par khadi ladki ne usko badi izzat se bataaya ki abhijaat sar kaa phone aayaa tha
 He has said that everything is normal in the office
 aap aaraam se apni chuttee par rahen
 If anything happens, they will leave a message for you
 sudeep ne resepshan vaali ladki ko subah 5 baje vek ap kol dene ke liye kaha
 He took dinner and came in the room and ate the medicine and turned on the TV
 usne dhyaan nahin diya tivi kaa wolum bahut tej tha or tivi on karte hi 'munni badnaam hui' gaanaa bajnaa shuru hua
 He immediately turned off the TV
 sudeep ne sone koshish karte hue aasmaan main dekha
 On the other hand, Chitra was still asleep

 petrol, deazal or rasoi gas ke daam badhate-badhate kahaan tak jaaenge kisi ko nahin pataa
 For many months, the public was being given the price of petrol diesel and cooking gas and it was assumed that the public is not even doing it this time because they are not raising slogans against the government
 tel ko lekar antarrashtriya sthiti jo pehle thi waisi hi abhi bhi he
 Everything is not international
 kuch bharat ke bheetar kii bhi samasya he
 In view of this, petrol started selling in many cities of the country at a price of more than Rs 90 per liter
 sarkaar ne aaj kuch kadam uthaaya he, jo thodi bahut raahat pahonchegi wo kitni der tak raahat rahegi kisi ko pataa nahin he
 In the international market, the price of crude oil has reached $ 85, which is the highest since November 2014
 vitt mantri jetali khud press conference karne aae or unhone kaha ki sarkaar petrol or deazal par dedh rupaya kam kar diya he
 Oil companies will reduce the price by one rupee per liter on their behalf
 kul milakar centre sarkaar or tel companiyon ne milakar dhai rupee prati litre daam kam kiye hai
 Arun Jaitley said, 'today we decided in the interministerial discussion and sent the proposal to the Prime Minister and he accepted
 exise duty ham log dedh rupaya kam karenge
 Oil marketing company will cut one rupee in its pricing, from the center, we will give relief to the consumers immediately for two and a half rupees, the revenue department will absorb 1 in both petrol and diesel
 50 ru centre kaa jo revenue fiks hota he, crude oil kaa price fiks hota he
 The VAT of the state governments is Ed Valorim, it is in percentage, some have 31 percent and some have less
 stats kaa 29 percent he
 If the price of crude increases, the revenue of the center remains the same
 crude oil kaa daam badhane se stats kaa revenue badhata jaataa he
 i am writing to all the State Governments that the State Governments should also give relief to the people, just as Rs 2
5 lakh is being spent by the Central Government
 dhai rupye wo waite se ebzorb karen
 ' vitt mantri ne is press conference main do baat kahi
 The first is that when crude oil prices rise, the center's revenue remains the same
 rajyon kii kamai badhati he
 Why does this happen
 kyonki centre jo excise duty lagaati he vah pichley saal aktubar se abtak 19 rupee 48 paise par fiks hi he
 The earnings of the states increase because the oil companies pay VAT to the dealer at the price
 tel companiyaan jitna mahangaa tel dealer ko dengi, waite se utani hi kamai rajya sarkaron kii badhati jaaegi
 Let us tell you how much the total revenue from the petroleum sector was in the first four years of the Modi government's tenure
 custom, exise, waite, crude oil ses sahit kai prakaar ke tex se 18 lakh 23, hazaar 760 karod kama chuke hai
 Out of this, the Government of India earned 11 lakh 4 thousand 72 crore, the total income of the states was 7 lakh 19,688 crore
 ye aankade march 2018 tak ke hai
 How much would have been earned since March, based on last year's earnings, if you estimate, then you add more than 2
5 million rupees
 yani chaar saal main centre or rajyon ne petroleum padaarthon par tex lagaakar kareeb 21 lakh karod se zyada kamai he
 All these figures are from the Ministry of Petroleum
 hamaare sahyogi himanshu shekhar mishra ne petroleum mantri dharmendra pradhan ke rajyasabha main die gaye bayaan ke aadhaar par bataaya he ki april 2014 main petrol par centre kaa utpaada shulk 9 rupee 48 paise tha
 On October 4, 16 rupees is 98 paise even after deduction of two and a half rupees
 april 2014 ke hisaab se dekhen to petrol par kareeb 70 percent tex badha he
 While the excise duty on diesel in April 2014 was 3 rupees 65 paisa liter, which is 12 rupees 83 paise liter even after today's deduction
 april 2014 kii tulana main aaj centre sarkaar deazal par kareeb 300 percent zyaada tex le rahi he
 Since January 1, 2018, petrol has become expensive by about Rs 14 in Delhi and Mumbai
 aaj kii katautee ke baad 5 rupee sasta hoga to kitni raahat hogi
 Petrol 77 in Mumbai on 1 January 2018
 87 rupee litre tha
 Petrol in Mumbai was 85 rupees 93 paise on 31 August
 4 aktubar ko mumbai main petrol 91
 34 paisa is the liter
 centre, tel companiyaan or maharashtra ne milakar 5 rupee kam kiye hai
 From October 5, petrol in Mumbai will be 86 rupees 34 paise
 kya 86 rupee 34 paise litre raahat he? Manoranjan Bharti raised a question that the government does not hold press conferences when oil prices rise
 jab daam kam honge yah bataane ke liye press conference karti he
 From 2017, the prices of petrol diesel started increasing every day
 sitambar maheene main kai rajyon ne petrol deazal ke daam ghataae the magar uskaa khaas laabh nahin hua
 Rajasthan had reduced the price by Rs 2
5 per liter, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh by Rs 2 per liter, Kerala and West Bengal by Rs 1 per liter
 tab maharashtra ne tex ghataane se manaa kar diya tha or kaha tha ki petrol deazal ko jiesti ke andar laana chahie
 But Devan Fadnavis did not delay in making the announcement after the Finance Minister's press conference on 4 October
 bihar ne jaldbaazi nahin dikhaai he
 The Deputy Chief Minister has said that he would consider getting the Finance Minister's letter
 anya pakshon ke bare main sochenge
 Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, UP, Chhattisgarh, Assam and Tripura have also reduced rupees two and a half
 jabaki jharkhand ne deazal kii keemton main dhai rupee kii kami to kii magar petrol ke daam nahin ghataae hai
 Could the government have done so much, what will it do when prices rise in the coming days
 rasoi gas kii keemton ke bare main kuch faisla hua
 Prices are increasing there too
 1 april 2018 ko 14
 The 2-kg gas cylinder was Rs 653
 1 agast 2018 ko isi vazan kaa silendar 789
 50 rupees
 1 aktubar ko 14
 The 2-kg gas cylinder has been priced at Rs 879
 yani april se lekar aktubar ke bich 226 rupaya bad chukaa he
 The 19 kg commercial cylinder has also become expensive by Rs 336 in 7 months
 5 kilogram kaa silendar bhi april se aktubar ke bich 80 rupaya mahangaa ho gaya he
 The subsidized cylinder has also become costlier by Rs 59 from 1 October
 kuch shaharon main to gas kaa silendar 900 se 1000 tak chalaa gaya he
 905 in Gujarat
 jammu kashmir main 1000 kaa he
 Agra has 910 and Lucknow has 917
 jo bhi he sarkaar chaahati he to petrol 5 rupee sasta ho jaataa he
 The government also announced on behalf of the oil companies that they will decrease by one rupee
 vitt mantri ne jis vakt isaki ghoshnaa kar rahe the us vakt share bazaar kaa sensex phir se dhadaam dhadaam girane laga jo subah se hi 800 ank se adhik gir chukaa tha
 Shares of Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum, Indian Oil and ONGC fell sharply at three in the afternoon
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne jaise hi elaan kiya ki oil marketing companiyaan apni ore se dedh rupye prati litre daam kam karengi to hindustan petroleum kaa share 248 rupye se gir kar 194 rupye par aa gaya
 Bharat Petroleum's stock fell from Rs 368 to Rs 306
 indian oil kaa share 155 rupye se girakar 129 rupye par aa gaya
 ongc's stock fell from 180 to 163 rupees
 bharat kii aarthik chunautiyaan abhi kam nahin hui hai
 There is still apprehension in the market due to the poor condition of ILFS Company Group
 aaj bhi sensex 870 se adhik ank neeche gira he
 The rupee today reached where it had never reached against the dollar
 ek dollars kabhi bhi 73 rupee 77 paise kaa nahin hua tha
 Today that too has happened
 4 aktubar ke din rupaya 44 paise kamazor hua ha
 At one time, 73 rupees and 81 paise was reached
 agast ke shuru main jaankaar disambar tak 74 rupee tak jane kii baat kar rahe the lekin ab baat hone lagi he ki kabhi bhi ek dollars ke mukaable rupaya 75 tak ja saktaa he
 US sanctions on Iran begin in November
 tab or chunautiyaan badhengi
 But Saudi Arabia has said that the amount of oil taken from Iran will make up for it
 shuukravaar ko agar reserve bank ne rate badha die tab or tabaahi machegi
 Home loan is going to be more expensive
 tippaniyan Crude oil is still not $ 90 per barrel
 86 dollars prati bairal he
 In 2012, petrol diesel prices went up against which in a BJP demonstration, Arun Jaitley said that when crude oil is $ 90 per barrel, petrol should not be more than Rs 50
 vahi jetali ab vitt mantri hai
 91 rupees a liter of petrol
 5 rupee kii raahat ko badi raahat bataai ja rahi he
 It is important to remind the old people so that the public remembers what is spoken among the public
 kitna aasaan hota he vipaksh main rahete hue bol dena ki 90 dollars prati bairal he to petrol 50 rupee litre hona chahie magar sarkaar main aane ke petrol ke daam tab bhi 50 rupee nahin hue jab kachche tel kii keemat 50 dollars prati bairal se kam ho gai
 Think how much tax has been paid by the public
 yahi nahin rupee ko lekar jis tarah kii raajnneeti hui use bhi yaad rakhana chahie
 How he was cut off from economic contexts and connected with respect and self-respect
 chunaav se pehle or chunaav ke dauraan hi nahin hua balki sarkaar main aane ke baad bhi pradhanmantri ne rupee kii majbooton ko sammaan or swabhimaan se jodate rahe
 The question is who would you like to add now
 arun jetali ne kaha, 'aaj hamane interministerial discshan main tay kiya or pradhanmantri ko prastaav bheja or unhone sweekaar kiya
 We will reduce excise duty by one and a half rupees
 oil marketing company ek rupee kii katautee apni prising main karenge, centre kii ore se ham log dhai rupye turant kanzumors ko relif denge, petrol or deazal donon main revenue department vil ebjorb 1
 50 rupees which is the revenue fixed by the center, the price of crude oil is fixed
 rajya sarkaron kaa jo waite he, wo aid valorem he, percentage main he, kuch kaa 31 percent he kuch kaa kam he
 States have 29%
 crude kaa daam badhata he to centre kaa revenue utana hi rahata he
 States' revenue increases as the price of crude oil increases
 sabhi rajya sarkaron ko likh rahaa hum ki jaise dhai rupee centre sarkaar ebjorb kar rahi he usee tarah rajya sarkarein bhi logon ko raahat den
 Absorbs two and a half rupees from VAT
 ' The Finance Minister said two things in this press conference
 pehla ki jab kachche tel ke daam badhate hai to centre kaa rajasav utana hi rahata he
 States' earnings grow
 aisa kyon hota he
 Because the excise duty imposed by the center is fixed at 19 rupees 48 paise since October last year
 rajyon kii kamai isliye badhati he kyonki dealer ko jis daam par tel companiyaan detii hai us par waite lagaati hai
 The more expensive the oil companies pay to the oil dealer, the more the revenue from VAT will increase to the state governments
 ham aapako bataa den ki modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke pehle chaar saal main petroleum sector se kul kamai kitni hui
 18 lakh 23 thousand 760 crores have been earned from various types of tax including custom, excise, VAT, crude oil cess
 isamen se bharat sarkaar kii kamai 11 lakh 4 hazaar 72 karod, rajyon kii kul kamai 7 lakh 19,688 karod rahi
 These figures are as of March 2018
 march se lekar ab tak kitni kamai hui hogi, pichley saal kii kamai ke aadhaar par anumaan lagaaein to isamen aap dhai lakh karod se zyada kii raashi or jod dijie
 That is, in four years, the Center and the states have earned more than 21 lakh crores by taxing petroleum products
 ye saare aankade petroleum mantralay ke hai
 Our colleague Himanshu Shekhar Mishra has said on the basis of Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan's statement in the Rajya Sabha that in April 2014 the excise duty of the Center on petrol was 9 rupees 48 paise
 4 aktubar ko dhai rupee kii katautee ke baad bhi 16 rupee 98 paise he
 As per April 2014, there has been an increase of about 70 percent tax on petrol
 jabaki april 2014 main deazal par excise duty 3 rupee 65 paise litre thi jo aaj kii katautee ke baad bhi 12 rupee 83 paise litre he
 Today, compared to April 2014, the central government is levying about 300 per cent more tax on diesel
 1 janvari 2018 se ab tak dilli or mumbai main petrol kareeb 14 rupaya mahangaa hua he
 After today's deduction, Rs 5 will be cheaper then what a relief
 1 janvari 2018 ko mumbai main petrol 77
 87 was a liter
 31 agast ko mumbai main petrol 85 rupaya 93 paise litre tha
 Petrol 91 in Mumbai on 4 October
 34 paise litre he
 The Center, the oil companies and Maharashtra together have reduced Rs 5
 5 aktubar se mumbai main petrol 86 rupee 34 paise ho jayega
 Is 86 rupees 34 paise a liter of relief? manoranjan bharti ne ek sawaal kiya ki jab tel ke daam badhate hai tab sarkaar press conference nahin karti he
 Press conference to tell when prices will be low
 2017 se petrol deazal ke daam rose ghatane badhane lage the
 In September, many states had reduced the price of petrol diesel, but it did not benefit much
 rajasthan ne dhai rupee litre, karnataka or aandh pradesh ne 2 rupee prati litre, kerala or pashchim bengal ne 1 rupee prati litre daam ghataae the
 Then Maharashtra refused to reduce the tax and said that petrol diesel should be brought under GST
 lekin 4 aktubar ko vitt mantri ke press conference ke baad deven fadanvis ne ghoshnaa karne main deree nahin kii
 Bihar has not shown haste
 up mukhyamantri ne kaha he ki vitt mantri kaa patr milane par vichaar karenge
 Will think of other parties
 madhya pradesh, gujarat, upi, chhattisgarh, assam or tripura ne bhi dhai rupee kam kar die hai
 While Jharkhand reduced the prices of diesel by two and a half rupees but it has not reduced the prices of petrol
 kya sarkaar itnaa hi kar sakati thi, aane vaale dinon main jab daam badhenge to tab kya karegi
 There was some decision on the prices of LPG
 daam vahaan bhi bad rahe hai
 14 on 1 April 2018
 2 kilogram kaa gas silendar 653 rupee kaa tha
 On 1 August 2018, cylinder 789 of the same weight
 50 rupee kaa ho gaya
 14 on 1 October
 2 kilogram kaa gas silendar 879 rupaya ho gaya he
 That is, 226 rupees have been increased between April and October
 19 kilogram vaala commercial silendar bhi 7 maheenon main 336 rupaya mahangaa ho chukaa he
 a 5 kg cylinder has also become costlier by Rs 80 between April and October
 sabsidi vaala silendar bhi 1 aktubar se 59 rupaya mahangaa ho gaya he
 In some cities, the gas cylinder has gone from 900 to 1000
 gujarat main 905 rupaya kaa he
 1000 in Jammu and Kashmir
 agra ke paas 910 kaa or lakhanu main 917 kaa he
 Whatever the government wants, petrol becomes 5 rupees cheaper
 sarkaar ne tel companiyon ke taraf se bhi elaan kiya ki ve ek rupee kii kami karengi
 At the time when the Finance Minister was announcing it, the stock market Sensex started falling again, which had fallen more than 800 points since morning
 dopaher teen baje hindustan petroleum, bharat petroleum, indian oil or oengisi ke share bahut tezi se gir gaye
 As soon as Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced that the oil marketing companies would reduce the price by one and a half rupees per liter, Hindustan Petroleum's share fell from Rs 248 to Rs 194
 bharat petroleum kaa share 368 rupye se girakar 306 rupye par aa gaya
 Indian Oil shares fell from Rs 155 to Rs 129
 oengisi kaa share 180 se 163 rupye par aa gaya
 India's economic challenges have not subsided yet
 lephes company samooh kii khasta haalat ke kaaran bazaar main abhi bhi ashanka bani hui he
 Even today, the Sensex has dropped more than 870 points
 dollars ke mukaable rupaya aaj vahaan pahunchaa jahaan kabhi nahin pahunchaa tha
 One dollar was never 73 rupees 77 paise
 aaj wo bhi ho gaya
 On October 4, the rupee has weakened by 44 paise
 ek samay to 73 rupee 81 paisa tak ja pahunchaa tha
 In early August, the experts were talking about going up to Rs 74 by December, but now it is being said that the rupee can go up to 75 against a dollar at any time
 november main iran par amareeki pratibandh shuru ho rahaa he
 Then more challenges will increase

 If the Reserve Bank raises rates on Friday, then more catastrophe will occur

 The comments abhi bhi crude aayal 90 dollar prati bairal nahin hua he

 2012 main petrol deazal ke daam bade jiske khilaaf bijepi ke ek pradarshan main arun jetali ne kaha tha ki jab kaccha tel 90 dollars prati bairal he to petrol 50 rupee se zyada nahin hona chahie
 The same Jaitley is now the Finance Minister
 91 rupee litre petrol ho gaya he
 The relief of Rs 5 is said to be a big relief
 puraani baton ko isliye yaad dilaanaa zaruri he taaki yaad rahe ki janata ke bich jo bolaa jaataa he wo janata yaad rakhti he
 How easy it is to say while in opposition that if the price is 90 dollars a barrel, then petrol should be 50 rupees a liter, but the price of petrol in the government did not come down even after 50 rupees when the price of crude oil fell below $ 50 a barrel
 
 sochie kitna tex diya he janata ne
 Not only this, the kind of politics related to money should also be remembered
 kis tarah se use aarthik sandarbhon se katkar sammaan or swabhimaan se jod diya gaya
 Not only did it happen before the elections and during the elections, but even after coming to the government, the Prime Minister kept linking the strengths of the rupee with respect and self-respect

 From October 5, petrol in Mumbai will be 86 rupees 34 paise
 kya 86 rupee 34 paise litre raahat he? Manoranjan Bharti raised a question that the government does not hold press conferences when oil prices rise
 jab daam kam honge yah bataane ke liye press conference karti he
 From 2017, the prices of petrol diesel started increasing every day
 sitambar maheene main kai rajyon ne petrol deazal ke daam ghataae the magar uskaa khaas laabh nahin hua
 Rajasthan had reduced the price by Rs 2
5 per liter, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh by Rs 2 per liter, Kerala and West Bengal by Rs 1 per liter
 tab maharashtra ne tex ghataane se manaa kar diya tha or kaha tha ki petrol deazal ko jiesti ke andar laana chahie
 But Devan Fadnavis did not delay in making the announcement after the Finance Minister's press conference on 4 October
 bihar ne jaldbaazi nahin dikhaai he
 The Deputy Chief Minister has said that he would consider getting the Finance Minister's letter
 anya pakshon ke bare main sochenge
 Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, UP, Chhattisgarh, Assam and Tripura have also reduced rupees two and a half
 jabaki jharkhand ne deazal kii keemton main dhai rupee kii kami to kii magar petrol ke daam nahin ghataae hai
 Could the government have done so much, what will it do when prices rise in the coming days
 rasoi gas kii keemton ke bare main kuch faisla hua

 In 2012, petrol diesel prices went up against which in a BJP demonstration, Arun Jaitley said that when crude oil is $ 90 per barrel, petrol should not be more than Rs 50
 vahi jetali ab vitt mantri hai
 91 rupees a liter of petrol
 5 rupee kii raahat ko badi raahat bataai ja rahi he
 It is important to remind the old people so that the public remembers what is spoken among the public
 kitna aasaan hota he vipaksh main rahete hue bol dena ki 90 dollars prati bairal he to petrol 50 rupee litre hona chahie magar sarkaar main aane ke petrol ke daam tab bhi 50 rupee nahin hue jab kachche tel kii keemat 50 dollars prati bairal se kam ho gai
 Think how much tax has been paid by the public
 yahi nahin rupee ko lekar jis tarah kii raajnneeti hui use bhi yaad rakhana chahie
 How he was cut off from economic contexts and connected with respect and self-respect
 chunaav se pehle or chunaav ke dauraan hi nahin hua balki sarkaar main aane ke baad bhi pradhanmantri ne rupee kii majbooton ko sammaan or swabhimaan se jodate rahe
 The question is who would you like to add now
 manoranjan bharti ne ek sawaal kiya ki jab tel ke daam badhate hai tab sarkaar press conference nahin karti he
 Press conference to tell when prices will be low
 2017 se petrol deazal ke daam rose ghatane badhane lage the
 In September, many states had reduced the price of petrol diesel, but it did not benefit much
 rajasthan ne dhai rupee litre, karnataka or aandh pradesh ne 2 rupee prati litre, kerala or pashchim bengal ne 1 rupee prati litre daam ghataae the
 Then Maharashtra refused to reduce the tax and said that petrol diesel should be brought under GST
 lekin 4 aktubar ko vitt mantri ke press conference ke baad deven fadanvis ne ghoshnaa karne main deree nahin kii
 Bihar has not shown haste
 up mukhyamantri ne kaha he ki vitt mantri kaa patr milane par vichaar karenge
 Will think of other parties
 madhya pradesh, gujarat, upi, chhattisgarh, assam or tripura ne bhi dhai rupee kam kar die hai
 While Jharkhand reduced the prices of diesel by two and a half rupees but it has not reduced the prices of petrol
 kya sarkaar itnaa hi kar sakati thi, aane vaale dinon main jab daam badhenge to tab kya karegi
 There was some decision on the prices of LPG
 daam vahaan bhi bad rahe hai

 Not only did it happen before the elections and during the elections, but even after coming to the government, the Prime Minister kept linking the strengths of the rupee with respect and self-respect
 sawaal he ki ab kisase jodna chahenge
 India's economic challenges have not subsided yet
 lephes company samooh kii khasta haalat ke kaaran bazaar main abhi bhi ashanka bani hui he
 Even today, the Sensex has dropped more than 870 points
 dollars ke mukaable rupaya aaj vahaan pahunchaa jahaan kabhi nahin pahunchaa tha
 One dollar was never 73 rupees 77 paise
 aaj wo bhi ho gaya
 On October 4, the rupee has weakened by 44 paise
 ek samay to 73 rupee 81 paisa tak ja pahunchaa tha
 In early August, the experts were talking about going up to Rs 74 by December, but now it is being said that the rupee can go up to 75 against a dollar at any time
 november main iran par amareeki pratibandh shuru ho rahaa he
 Then more challenges will increase
 lekin saudi arab ne kaha he ki jitna tel iran se liya jaataa he uski bharpai kar degaa
 If the Reserve Bank raises rates on Friday, then more catastrophe will occur
 home lone or mahangaa hone ja rahaa he
 The comments abhi bhi crude aayal 90 dollar prati bairal nahin hua he
 86 dollars per barrel
 2012 main petrol deazal ke daam bade jiske khilaaf bijepi ke ek pradarshan main arun jetali ne kaha tha ki jab kaccha tel 90 dollars prati bairal he to petrol 50 rupee se zyada nahin hona chahie
 The same Jaitley is now the Finance Minister
 91 rupee litre petrol ho gaya he
 The relief of Rs 5 is said to be a big relief
 puraani baton ko isliye yaad dilaanaa zaruri he taaki yaad rahe ki janata ke bich jo bolaa jaataa he wo janata yaad rakhti he
 How easy it is to say while in opposition that if the price is 90 dollars a barrel, then petrol should be 50 rupees a liter, but the price of petrol in the government did not come down even after 50 rupees when the price of crude oil fell below $ 50 a barrel
 
 sochie kitna tex diya he janata ne
 Not only this, the kind of politics related to money should also be remembered
 kis tarah se use aarthik sandarbhon se katkar sammaan or swabhimaan se jod diya gaya
 Not only did it happen before the elections and during the elections, but even after coming to the government, the Prime Minister kept linking the strengths of the rupee with respect and self-respect
 sawaal he ki ab kisase jodna chahenge
 Crude oil is still not $ 90 per barrel
 86 dollars prati bairal he
 In 2012, petrol diesel prices went up against which in a BJP demonstration, Arun Jaitley said that when crude oil is $ 90 per barrel, petrol should not be more than Rs 50
 vahi jetali ab vitt mantri hai
 91 rupees a liter of petrol
 5 rupee kii raahat ko badi raahat bataai ja rahi he
 It is important to remind the old people so that the public remembers what is spoken among the public
 kitna aasaan hota he vipaksh main rahete hue bol dena ki 90 dollars prati bairal he to petrol 50 rupee litre hona chahie magar sarkaar main aane ke petrol ke daam tab bhi 50 rupee nahin hue jab kachche tel kii keemat 50 dollars prati bairal se kam ho gai
 Think how much tax has been paid by the public
 yahi nahin rupee ko lekar jis tarah kii raajnneeti hui use bhi yaad rakhana chahie
 How he was cut off from economic contexts and connected with respect and self-respect
 chunaav se pehle or chunaav ke dauraan hi nahin hua balki sarkaar main aane ke baad bhi pradhanmantri ne rupee kii majbooton ko sammaan or swabhimaan se jodate rahe
 The question is who would you like to add now
 puraani baton ko isliye yaad dilaanaa zaruri he taaki yaad rahe ki janata ke bich jo bolaa jaataa he wo janata yaad rakhti he
 How easy it is to say while in opposition that if the price is 90 dollars a barrel, then petrol should be 50 rupees a liter, but the price of petrol in the government did not come down even after 50 rupees when the price of crude oil fell below $ 50 a barrel

 They attack every now and then, we count the martyrs
 jahaan-tahaan wo bam or goliyaan barasaate hai or ham, laashen sametate hai
 There are reports from many corners of the country that they ambushed again and we just keep on lamenting with impunity
 desh main bad rahe naksali hamale aane vaale vakt main bharat ke liye sabase bada khatra he
 Why is Naxalite becoming the biggest threat to the country? Why is it so difficult to stop the Naxalite attack? The recent Naxalite attack in Chhattisgarh's Darbha Valley may have shaken the entire nation, but people from states like Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh have been facing such attacks for years
 darasal, jharkhand ke palamu or gadwa jile ke border par 21 janvari 2012 ko anjaam die gaye naksali hamale ke baad naksaliyon ne ek video ko khud hi filmaaya tha
 a total of 13 police personnel including the police station in-charge of Bhandariya were killed in this attack
 vaardaat ke roj us ilaake main gaanvvaalon ne swathykarmiyon ko kabje main lekar sadak jam kar diya tha or ilaake ke esadio, bidio, jila parishad ke adhyaksh or pulisavaale gaanvvaalon se baatcheet karne gaye the, lekin isi dauraan naksaliyon ne ghaat kar hamalaa kiya or police kii gaadi is land mine visphot kaa shikaar ban gai
 The special thing was that this landmine was placed on a paved road so closely that it was impossible to see it with open eyes, but as soon as the police car passed over it, a loud bang flew the train's car
 isi tarah jharkhand ke gadwa zile main hue is naksali hamale ko yaad kar aaj bhi log kaanp uthte hai
 Not only 13 policemen lost their lives in this attack, but the dangerous manner in which this incident was carried out, this land mine blast is still mentioned even today due to the Naxalite attacks
 isi video main record naksali commander kii aawaaj par yakeen karen to is hamale main unhone puure 65 kilo visphotak kaa istemaal kiya or badi maatra main lagaai gai is barood kaa asar yah hua ki jaise hi police kii gaadi landmine ke upar se gujri, yah hawa main uchhal kar pedo ke upar se hoti hui 25 feet dur ja giri
 In this blast, where the parts of the vehicle were shattered, most of the policemen died due to falling from such a height, but the policemen who survived despite being injured, after the Naxalites pulled them out of the car Left to die in the forest
 khaas baat yah rahi ki is land mine ke hamale se naksaliyon ne doharaa phayda uthaaya
 First, he spoke of taking revenge after taking the life of the policemen, and took the weapons of the soldiers who were killed in the second attack
 iske liye naa sirf ek-ek pulisavaale or unki laashon kii jama talaashi lee gai, balki gaadi ke bheetar maujuud aslhon ko bhi bator liya gaya or tab baari ai pulisavaalon kii bachi hui gaadi ko nestnabud karne kii
 In the end, with this intention, the Naxalites also set the police car turned into junk
 ab laashon kaa dher jamaa ho chukaa tha
 Therefore, the Naxalites decided to bring these corpses to the roadside again to convey the message to the regime
 iske baad ek-ek sabhi kii sabhi laashen main road tak laai gayi, kyonki inhen pataa tha ki is tarah is land mine blast kii khabar shahar tak jaldi pahonchegi or shashan par iskaa asar bhi dugana hoga
 This is not where the death of the naxalites ended, the naxalites celebrated the darkness of night after laying the corpses of 13 policemen in Jharkhand

 Khalis primitive, full of glimpses, jungle like rugged and for this reason very original article
 riter kaa naam tha shrimoyi piyu kundu
 If awareness arises, gather information phir pataa chalaa ki inhen mohatarama ne sitaj kars bhi likhi he
 This book went through a few turns of sight
 naam ke chalate jehan bhi atka sa tha
 But then the matter had come
 magar bhala ho bultu lekh kaa, kitaab padhane kaa sanyog aa gujara
 However, now on the talk book
 isaki shuruyaat bhartiya sandarbhon main sansanikhej he
 a reminder of Fifty Shades of Gray
 ek nimna madhyavarg parivaar kii mahila, subah savere, apane bedroom main hastmaithun kar rahi he
 i wish i was hurt by a miss
 or phir daravaaje par uske pati or saas kii chot or aawaaj takaraati he
 After this prologue, the reader becomes eager to get into the rugged Meera story
 mira, gujarat ke ek paaramparik parivaar kii ladki
 Scared of father
 maa se chipatati or bhai main apana dost talashti
 But the strings of traditionalism start to get tangled when this same Meera tries to solve the initial riddles of the body with her brother Karthik
 magar phir ek haadasa ghatata he or karthik ek tis bhari yaad banakar uski youniktaa, uske anubhavon se chipat jaataa he
 When then, like a leech, his part would suck blood
 mira ek baar phir nae sire se jindagi ko sehlaana shuru karti he
 Then she gets married to Mohan, a young man living in Mumbai
 magar shaadi ke baad bhi mira kii duniya ke hichkole khatm nahin hote
 Mohan lives in Mumbai with his adulterous mother, brother Bansi and his wife Vrinda
 mira in logon ke bich apni jagah banane kii koshish karti he
 But her husband Mohan is a victim of a strange sexual gland
 vah apni daihik jaruraton ke liye to tatpar he
 But he always leaves Meera unfulfilled
 jismani taur par bhi or dimagi taur par bhi
 In the midst of all this, Meera is handed over to her mother-in-law by her master
 yahaan mira ko ek alag hi lok ke darshan hote hai
 After all, when Meera's life seems to be on track, then an accident happens and everything reverses
 iske baad mira bhi apane tain khushiyaan khojane nikal padati he
 Sitas curse is not just an expression of a woman's sexual aspirations
 yah hamaare samaaj ke dohare ravaiye kii pole khol he
 This book in many places boldly describes our pseudo-morality, asks questions, lashes out
 or isiilie iskaa naam sitaj kars rakhaa gaya he
 Stumbling at the end, despite remaining well in all ways
 dutkaar paanaa
 To embalm life by sitting on the corpse of your desires
 lekhika shrimoyi piyu kundu ne puure nowell main ek adrishy tanaav ko banaae rakhaa he
 The names of the central characters Meera and Mohan are also a result of this
 iske alaava unhone baarik byoron ke jariye seen ko ankhon ke saamne sasharir khadaa karne main bhi kamyaabi pai he
 According to the first novel, all these efforts deserve praise
 nowell kii bhashaa bhi saral he
 Readers of Hindi can also take this novel without hesitation
 asaram prakaran or mumbai kii baadh kaa kahani main acha istemaal kiya gaya he
 Some things in the book could have been even better
 masalan, isaki lambaai kuch kam rakhi ja sakati thi
 In the latter the reader may be somewhat impatient to reach the end
 guru ke saath sansarg yaa phir sex chat jaisi tamaam baaten kathanak kaa hissaa he, magar kai baar ve fifty shades kii tarah hi lambii khinchati lagati hai
 You should definitely meet Sitara Curse's Mira
 mira, hamaare aasapaas kii ladki

 Rajnath Singh
 raajnneeti ke manze hue khilaadi
 Rajnath Singh has good experience in politics at the center and state level
 buudhvaar ko unhone bijepi ke adhyaksh pad kii jimmedaari sanbhali he
 They are well aware that both their new responsibility and above all the tenure of Nitin Gadkari's presidency of the last three years cannot be ignored
 rajnath ko yah bhi bakhubi pataa he ki unki dagar aasaan nahin hogi
 Despite all this, he appears determined and shows his allegiance to his work
 38, ashok road sthit apane nivas sthaan par maid today se baat karte hue rajnath singh ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki raajnneetik varg apni vishwasaneeyata ko puri tarah se kho chukaa he

 Rajnath Singh's not only attacking the UPA government but taking the whole political system under wraps indicates that there is a lot of pressure on Nitin Gadkari's past tenure
 gadakari ko unki company purti group main aniyamittaaon ke aaropon ke chalate bijepi adhyaksh kii duusari pari kaa mauka nahin mila
 One of the reasons behind Rajnath Singh being elected to the post of President by the party is that his political career so far has been clean and non-controversial
 ladaai ke mood membijapi ke nae adhyaksh rajnath singh bina koi samay ganvaae jang ke maidan main utar gaye hai
 He is going to lead the protest on behalf of BJP on Thursday (24 January 2013)
 yah virodh-pradarshan grahamantri susheel kumaar scindia ke us bayaan ke khilaaf he, jisamen unhone hindu aatankwaad kaa zikr kiya tha
 Rajnath Singh said, 'congress wants to divide the country on the basis of communalism
 is tarah ke bayaan keval aatankwaad ko badhaava denge
 It is clear that the Congress party is only interested in vote bank politics and is not really serious in fighting terrorism
 'party headquarter par dhol-nagaadon or kaaryakartaaon kii joshili narebaaji ke bich rajnath singh ne upie sarkaar ke khilaaf bigul baja diya he
 Rajnath Singh said, 'the country is going through a crisis at this time, only BJP can solve the problems of this country and people are also concerned to check these problems
 mujhe vishwaas he ki 2014 main hone vaale chunaavon main bhaajapa ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar banegi
 'but as a commander, they have to fight
 party ke bheetar bhi anushaasan banaae rakhana unki jimmedaari he, jiske liye vah chintit bhi hai
 He said, there needs to be better coordination within the party
 main sabko saath lekar chalanaa chaahunga
 On maintaining harmony in the party, he says that it is very important
 aisa kuch kehane se bachanaa hoga, jo kisi ko dukh pahunchaae
 He said that assembly elections are going to be held in many states of the country soon and then there are also Lok Sabha elections
 aise main sadbhaav kaayam rakhana jaruri ho jaataa he
 Rajnath Singh, LK Advani and Nitin Gadkari stood alongside each other to demonstrate solidarity in the party
 party main gutbaji ke ant kaa sanket diya gaya
 Senior party leaders Murali Manohar Joshi, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Venkaiah Naidu and Ananth Kumar were also present on the stage
 madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan or jharkhand ke purv siem arjuna munda bhi pehali pankti main shaamil netaaon main the
 Singh wants that there should be better coordination in the party, not only at the central level, but also at the state level
 ve kehete hai, apane pichley kaarykaal ke dauraan main rajyon kii karrwai ko samaj nahin paaya tha
 i have visited many states and i am aware of the problems faced at the state level
 bijepi adhyaksh ke taur par apane pichley kaarykaal (2006 se 2009) ke dauraan kai rajyon ke netaaon ke saath unke sambandh bahut sauhardpurn nahin the
 But now they want to establish more and more cordial relations not only with all the states, but also with the parties associated with them
 rajnath singh ne apane purvavarti matlab nitin gadakari kii tarif karte hue yah bataane kii koshish kii ki sab kuch thik he
 Singh said, i have been made the president of the party in unfortunate circumstances
 ham chaahate the ki nitin gadakari ko doosraa mauka mili, isi ke liye hi party ke samvidhan main sanshodhan kiya gaya tha
 But the way the government made false accusations on Gadkari and tried to implicate him by imposing an IT raid, Gadkari himself refused to take up the post of president again
 party ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ne baari utsaah ke bare main kaha ki is tarah kaa utsaah to dow
 Shyama Prasad was not there even during Mukherjee's election

 Vinod Khanna died of bladder cancer
 khabaron ke mutabik ve pichley saat saalon se is beemaari se jhujh rahe the, lekin isse batch nahin sake
 Today, you also know what is this cancer, how are its symptoms and who is most at risk of coming out of it
 is fal ko khaane se khatm ho jayega cancer
 
 
 According to bladder cancer doctors, the cancer starts when the bladder wall tissue is infused in the body
 shuruyaat main blader main khun ke thakke jamane aarambh hote hai
 These are the symptoms- Initial symptoms include blood with urin
 darasal jab blader infectid hota he to aisa hota he
 - Burning and severe pain occurs while urinating due to infection in the bladder
 agar ye lambey samay tak bana rahe yaa baar-baar ho to sachet ho janaa chahie
 - This is a common symptom that occurs in many major diseases
 ye he bina kisi vajah ke teji se vajan kam ho janaa
 If this has happened or is happening to you, do not take it lightly
 iske saath hi thodaa sa kaam karke thak janaa or kamajori rahanaa bhi iske lakshanon main shaamil he
 Why should women eat Kasuri methi, learn 5 big benefits
 
 
 - ureen ke saath safed tishyus discharge hona or pet ke nichle hisse yani pelvic rigen main dard bane rahanaa
 - People suffering from this often complain of persistent pain in bones
 - agar baar-baar ureen infections ho rahaa ho to bhi ye iskaa ek lakshan ho saktaa he
 Do you know about these misconceptions related to cancer? 
 
 koun hai jad mendoctors or tamaam studies kahati hai ki is beemaari kii jad main 60 saal se zyada ke log sabase adhik hai
 Also, people who are overweight are also at risk
 zyada smoking karne vaale or sharaab kaa atyadhik seven karne waalon ko ye hone kaa khatra adhik hota he

 a post shared by Voompla (@voompla) on Apr 27, 2018 at 5:53am PDT In Kolkata's Vivekananda Road flyover accident, 25 people have died
 guuruuvaar dopaher greater bada bazaar ke ganesh takies krancig par yah pul 2008 se ban rahaa tha
 This flyover has not been completed even in 6 years
 ise kaayade se 2012 main hi ban janaa chahie tha lekin 2016 main banane se pehle gir hi gaya
 In the big market where this flyover is being built, there is no place to keep a foot on normal days
 ek pul kaa girnaa kitna aasaan he, mushkil he to yah jaananaa ki kyon gira? kahin is tarah se koi pul girtaa he
 a local citizen told that barricades have been put under this bridge so no truck has entered
 maheenaa bhar pehle do baar trek bairicade todakar andar ghus aayaa
 a truck then came inside for fifteen to twenty feet and crashed into a pole
 khambha kshatigrast hua
 There is also a traffic police post at the same place
 to kya company or prashasan ko yah najar nahin aayaa ki pul gir saktaa he
 The local citizen told that a strange twist takes place where the bridge has fallen
 dekhakar lagata he ki dizin sahi nahin he
 It is therefore necessary to ascertain reliably what causes the bridge to collapse
 act aaf thekedaar kii vajah se gira yaa 'act aaf god' kii vajah se
 Rescuers said that 25 people were dead, but who was to die? What will happen to the family that has died now? Sanjay Malhotra, Tapan Dutta, Asha Joshi, AD Ramjani, Gajendra Sethia, Nirmal Kumar, Sonia Yadav, Sunil Vishwakarma, Ranjit Sahai are the names of those who died under the bridge
 kolkata ke akhbaar sanhmaarg main mahadev adak ke bare main chapa he
 Mahadev was a cashier in a company of Bada Bazaar
 subah cash lene ke liye nikle hi the, pul gir gaya
 He was a resident of Baksada area of jagacha police station of Howrah
 unke ghar kaa intjaam koun dekhegaa
 There is an act of God for this
 kanoonee bhashaa he 'act aaf god' lekin ham bhul gaye hai kab kya or kaise bolnaa he
 According to Kolkata newspapers, there are 3 rickshaw drivers among those who died
 kuch abhi bhi laapata bataae ja rahe hai
 Shabana Bano had come to fetch her child from school, was buried under the bridge
 aakhri vakt main do baar ghar phone bhi kiya ki bachaa lo
 His body was taken out on Friday morning
 bada bazaar se kolkata nagar nigam or rajya sarkaar ko khub rajasav miltaa he lekin jab aap yahaan aaenge to lagegaa ki angrejon ke jane ke baad yahaan koi sarkaar ai hi nahin
 Generally, this is the case for such traditional markets
 is bazaar main har dal kaa daftar or jhanda dikhegaa
 Like everywhere, the business class has the highest contact in every party, but they are not able to fix the condition of their own market
 is pul kaa bananaa or girnaa donon hi raajnneetik vyavastha kii naakaami kaa pramaan he
 This bridge comes in ward number 23, 24, 25
 23 number ward se bijepi he
 24 and 25 are Trinamool Congress from the ward
 vidhayak or saansad donon trinmul congress se hai
 Rabindranath Tagore's house is exactly one hundred meters from where part of the bridge fell
 unheen ke ghar ke naam par vidhansabha kaa naam he
 There are Trinamool mlas
 aaj congress or bijepi ne aarope lagaaya he ki inke ek rishtedaar ke paas pul nirmaan ke liye lebar or material supplai kaa theka tha
 The bridge was being built under the Jawaharlal Urban Mission under the supervision of the state government
 uttar kolkata ke trinmul saansad sudeep bandhopadhyaay ne kaha he ki unhone rajya sarkaar se pul kii dizin kii shikaayat kii thi lekin tab tak 60 fisadi hissaa ban chukaa tha
 The foundation stone was laid in 2001, work started in 2008
 march 2016 main bhi nahin bana or gir hi gaya
 If a 60-meter-long bridge falls, weighing 140 tons, imagine how much effort it would have taken to remove debris
 kolkata police, sena ke jawan, andiaref, department aaf mins and jiyology, nigam ke ejeeniyar sahit paanch hajaar log jute hai
 Trinamool Congress leaders are accusing CPM
 sipiem vaale trinmul par aarope laga rahe hai
 If properly investigated, it will be known that the company building the bridge has the most relationships
 2011 se 2016 paanch saal tak trinmul kii sarkaar rahi
 Why doesn't anyone clearly explain why it was not made? Why has not the threat of danger been heard? Why did the Trinamool government not pay attention to its own MP? aap is fliover ko thik se dekhen to samaj main aa jayega ki yah ban bhi jaataa to kisi kahar se kam nahin hota
 The flyover has made all cities ugly
 yah fliover jis tarah se guzar rahaa he vah sateek udhaaharan he, yah samajhane kaa ki ham apane shaharon ke saath kya kar rahe hai
 Like a dry drain, this flyover adjoining the houses on both sides is flowing, Badrang, Benur and Bedrang
 dizine dekhakar lagata he bharat main ejineering or dizine kii padhai band ho gai he
 Neither understanding nor imagination can be seen
 is pul ko banane se pehle yah tak nahin sochaa gaya ki aasapaas ke makaanon or logon ke jivan par kya asar padegaa
 All these houses are sixty to seventy years old
 inke bich se do kilometre lanbaa pul gujaarne kaa khyaal kis mahaan vaigyanik kaa tha use hajir kiya janaa chahie
 The bridge is passing by touching the houses here
 itane kareeb se ki aap scale se naap sakate hai
 There is not even a foot difference
 koi ejineering fail hoga tab bhi aisi dizine nahin banayega
 Will keep a difference of at least five to six feet
 yahaan ke makaanon ke itane kareeb se guzar rahaa he ki khidkiyaan bhi nahin khul sakati hai
 Now tell me, if this bridge were built, what would be the impact on the houses here
 pul ke kampan se makaanon par kya asar padataa
 Which engineering college in the world is taught such a design that make a bridge or highway close to the window of the house
 kya yah sirf hindustan main ho saktaa he? kya yah sirf kolkata main ho saktaa he? pul nahin bhi girtaa to banane ke baad is pul par isse sate makaan gir jate
 People have also been sued
 vyapaariyon ne bhi iskaa virodh hi kiya he
 From the Left to the Trinamool Government, it must take responsibility for the bizarre and dangerous design of this bridge
 yah fliover kolkata ke kisi kone yaa kinare main nahin ban rahaa tha balki behad mahatvapurn jagah he
 There are hospitals around, coaching institutes, fruit and flower markets
 pushta main ise khatm hona tha jahaan kaaphi bada makaan he
 People there also have to test how they organize and fight their battles
 darasal log ladate hai magar vyavasthaaen unhen haraa hi detii hai
 Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee sat on the scene from noon to one o'clock on Thursday, monitoring the rescue work
 tamaam afasar maujuud the
 It is commendable to look at the aftermath of the incident that Mamata Banerjee is sitting on the road watching all the work but if she showed the same activity to the complaints related to it before the bridge collapsed, then this incident would not have been averted
 kya mamata banerjee yaa pul banane vaala vibhaag isaki dizine ko lekar puri tarah aashwast tha
 He had promised that the bridge would be built soon, but did he pay attention to what his own mps and local people were complaining about the bridge? ab aate hai company ji par
 Their name is IVRCL
 company ji kaa mukhyalay he hyderabad main
 It has 3000 engineers
 itani badi fouj he ejiniyaron kii iske paas
 The company has written on its site that this is the most difficult project of JNNURM
 puri tarah se steel kaa dhaancha he
 The 25-year-old company is involved in a variety of businesses
 jal or paryaavaran, sinchai, transportesan, building or industrial strecchar, bijli kii supplai, mining mentanence sahit kai kaarobaar hai iske
 The company is also listed on the National Stock Exchange and BSE
 andhrapradesh, madhyapradesh, maharashtra se lekar karnataka tak main is company ke paas theke hai
 An investigation into why the bridge fell has started and Kolkata Police has reached Hyderabad
 itane bade-bade kaarobaaron se jude rahane ke baad bhi haadase ke baad is company kaa bayaan aata he ki yah 'act aaf god' he
 The bridge itself has destroyed the temple of God
 god to nahin magar godes kaali ke mandir kaa baramada bhi gir gaya he is naamuraad pul ke girane se
 This statement of the company has drawn much criticism in the human world
 god kii taraf se apane act par safai to nahin ai magar god ko is act main lapetane vaali company ne hyderabad main safai di ki ho saktaa he ki dhamaakaa hua ho
 Mirrors are broken
 company ko is pul ko banane ke liye pehali dedline 18 maheene kii di gai thi
 67 months passed
 IVRCL company jahaan deree ke liye kolkata metropolitan deveopment athurity ko samay par jagah nahin dene kaa jimmedaar tehraati he vahiin kolkata metropolitan deveopment athurity kaa aarope he ki company bahut dhire kaam kar rahi he
 But what is the charge right now
 aarope yah nahin he ki pul banane main itnaa samay kyon laga
 The allegation is how the sixty meter section of the bridge collapsed
 wo bhi nayaa vaala hissaa kaise gira
 In fact, IVRCL, which formed the sports village for the Hyderabad National Games in 2002, is badly hit by debts and losses
 company par kareeb 10,000 karod kaa qarj he
 In 2015 December, its loss has been 2000 crores
 company pul ke nirmaan kii lagaat badhwaana chaahati thi
 It is difficult to say whose claims are right and what is wrong, but 25 people have lost their lives due to the fall of the bridge
 kolkata main company ke 8 logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he, lekin agar pul banane main deree kii jimmedaar sarkari athurity hai to unhen bhi baksha nahin janaa chahie
 The comments ab aate hai aaj ke sawaal par
 Are flyovers so important that we make them anywhere
 desh bhar main fliover ko dekhenge to aapako aise bahut se fliover milenge to dhang ke bane hon
 Seeing some flyovers in small towns makes one nervous
 har jagah trephic jam kii samasya badhati ja rahi he
 Leaders also lay the foundation of the plyover to reassure the people
 dilli main jahaan pichley das-pandrah saalon main sau ke kareeb fliover to bane hi honge
 i can tell from the experience of this city that some flyovers seem successful but even after the formation of most flyovers, the problem of jam does not end
 mumbai main 50 fliover banane kii baat do dashak se chal rahi he
 There are 40 flyovers in Bengaluru
 chennai main bhi khub fliover bane hai
 You keep looking at the photographs of the foundation and inauguration of the flyover in newspapers every day, but have you ever seen whether they will solve the problem of traffic or not
 trephic ke alaava yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki fliover kii vajah se aasapaas kii saamaajik vyavastha bhi prabhavit hoti he
 The environment will also be affected
 kya aapako bhi lagata he ki fliover aane ke baad se trephic jam kii samasya samaapt ho gai he
 In my own experience both these things are there
 agar dilli ke sarai kaale khan se trephic kaa hal nahin hua he to gajipur fliover banane se kaaphi kuch hal hua he
 How easy it is for a bridge to fall, it is difficult to know why it fell
 Somewhere a bridge falls like this
 ek sthaneey naagarik ne bataaya ki is pul ke neeche koi trek na ghuse isliye bairicade laga he
 Twice a month ago, the truck broke into the barricade and entered inside
 ek trek to pandrah bees foot tak andar aa gaya or ek khambhe se takaraa gaya
 Pole damaged
 usee jagah par trephic police kaa post bhi he
 So, didn't the company and administration see that the bridge could collapse
 sthaneey naagarik ne bataaya ki jahaan par pul gira he vahaan ek ajeeb sa mode banataa he
 Seeing that the design is not correct
 isliye jaruri he ki vishwasaneey tareeke se pataa lagaaya jaae ki pul kin kaarnon se gira
 Drop because of Act of Contractor or because of 'act of God'
 bachaav dal ne to kah diya ki 25 log mare hai lekin marane vaala koun tha? jo mara he ab uske parivaar kaa kya hoga? sanjay malhotra, tapan datta, aashaa joshi, edi ramjaani, gajendra sethiya, nirmal kumaar, sonia yadav, sunil vishwakarma, ranjit sahay yah naam hai un logon ke jo pul ke neeche dab kar mar gaye
 The Kolkata newspaper Sanmarg has featured about Mahadev Adak
 mahadev bada bazaar kii ek company main kaisier the
 As we left to take cash in the morning, the bridge fell
 haavda ke jagaachha thana ke baksaada ilaake ke rahane vaale the
 Who will see the arrangement of their house
 iske liye koi act aaf god hota he
 The legal language is 'act of God' but we have forgotten when and how to speak
 kolkata ke akhabaaron ke anusaar marane waalon main 3 rickshaw chaalak bhi hai
 Some are still reported missing
 shabana bano apane bachche ko skool se laane nikali thi, pul ke neeche dab gayi
 At the last moment, he also called home twice to save
 shuukravaar ko subah unka shav baahar nikaala gaya
 Kolkata Municipal Corporation and the state government get a lot of revenue from Bada Bazaar, but when you come here, you will feel that no government came here after the British left
 aam taur par aise paaramparik bazaaron kaa yahi haal hota he
 Every party's office and flag will be seen in this market
 har jagah kii tarah vyapaarik varg kaa har dal main upar tak sampark he magar ve apane hi market kaa haal thik nahin kar pate hai
 The construction and fall of this bridge are both proof of the failure of the political system
 yah pul ward number 23, 24, 25 main aata he
 23 is BJP from ward
 24 or 25 number ward se trinmul congress he
 Both the MLA and MP are from Trinamool Congress
 rabindranath tagore kaa ghar thik sau meter kii duuri par he, jahaan pul kaa hissaa gira tha
 The assembly is named after his house
 vahaan se trinmul kii vidhayak hai
 Today, Congress and BJP have alleged that one of their relatives had labor and material supply contracts for the construction of the bridge
 yah pul rajya sarkaar kii nigaraanee main jawaharlal urban mishan ke tahat ban rahaa tha
 Trinamool MP from North Kolkata, Sudeep Bandhopadhyay, has said that he had complained to the state government about the design of the bridge but by then 60 per cent had been formed
 shilanyas hua tha iskaa 2001 main, kaam shuru hua 2008 main
 Did not even make and fell in March 2016
 60 meter lanbaa pul gir jaae, jiskaa vajan 140 ton ho to sochie malbe ko hataane main kitni mashkkat kerani padi hogi
 Five thousand people including Kolkata Police, Army Jawans, NDRF, Department of Mines and Geology, Corporation Engineers have gathered
 trinmul congress ke netaa sipiem par aarope laga rahe hai
 CPM people are accusing Trinamool
 thik se jaanch ho jaae to pataa chalegaa ki pul banane vaali company ke sabase rishte hai
 The Trinamool government was in power for five years from 2011 to 2016
 koi saaf-saaf kyon nahin bataata ki kyon nahin bana? kyon nahin khatre kii ashanka ke bare main suna gaya? trinmul sarkaar ne apane hi saansad kii baat par dhyaan kyon nahin diya? If you look at this flyover properly, it will be understood that even if it were built, it would not have caused any havoc
 fliover ne tamaam shaharon ko badsoorat kar diya he
 The exact way this flyover is going through is an example of understanding what we are doing with our cities
 kisi sookhe naale kii tarah donon taraf ke makaanon se sate yah fliover bahata chalaa aa rahaa he, badrang, benur or beong
 Looking at design, it seems that engineering and design studies have stopped in India
 na samaj, na kalpana dikhti he
 Before constructing this bridge, it was not even thought about how it would affect the lives of the surrounding houses and people
 yah saare makaan saath se sattar saal puraane hai
 The thought of which great scientist to pass a two kilometer long bridge between them should be present
 pul yahaan ke makaanon ko chhukar guzar rahaa he
 So close that you can scale
 ek foot kaa bhi antar nahin he
 Even if there is an engineering failure, we will not make such a design
 kam se paanch se chah foot kaa antar to rakhega
 The houses here are passing so close that even the windows cannot open
 ab aap bataaie yah pul ban jaataa to yahaan ke makaanon par kya asar padataa
 How would the vibration of the bridge affect the houses
 duniya ke kis ejineering kalege main aisi dizine padhai jaati he ki ghar kii khidki se sataakar pul yaa haive bana do
 Can this happen only in India? Can this happen only in Kolkata? If the bridge did not fall, then the houses adjacent to it would fall on this bridge
 logon ne mukadmaa bhi kiya hua he
 Traders have also opposed this
 vampanth se lekar trinmul sarkaar ko is pul kii vicitra or khatarnaak dizine kii to jimmedaari leni hi chahie
 This flyover was not being built in any corner or side of Kolkata but is a very important place
 aasapaas aspataal hai, koching santhaan hai, fal or phool kii mandi he
 It was to end in Pushta where there is a very big house
 vahaan ke logon kaa bhi imtahaan he ki ve kaise sangathit hokar apni ladaai ladate hai
 Actually people fight but the systems beat them
 mukhyamantri mamata banerjee guuruuvaar ko dopaher se lekar raat ke ek baje tak ghatnasthal par baithkar bachaav kaary kii nigaraanee karti raheen
 All officers were present
 ghatana ke baad kii najar se dekhen to saraahneey he ki mamata banerjee sadak par baithkar sara kaam dekh rahi hai lekin yahi sakriyata pul girane se pehle ve isse judi shikayaton ke prati dikhaatin to kya yah haadasa tal nahin jaataa
 Was Mamata Banerjee or the bridge-making department fully confident of its design
 unhone to vaada kiya tha ki pul jaldi banegaa lekin kya unhone dhyaan diya tha ki pul ko lekar unke hi saansad or sthaneey log kya shikaayat kar rahe the? Now come to company inkaa naam he IVRCL
 The company is headquartered in Hyderabad
 iske paas 3000 ejeeniyar hai
 It has such a large army of engineers
 company ne apni site par likhaa he ki yah JNNURM kaa yah sabase mushkil project he
 The structure is entirely steel
 25 saal puraani yah company kai tarah ke kaarobaar se judi he
 It has many businesses including water and environment, irrigation, transportation, building and industrial structures, power supply, mining maintenance
 company neshnal stock exange or bisai main listed bhi he
 The company has contracts in Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra to Karnataka
 pul kyon gira isaki jaanch shuru ho gai he or kolkata kii police hyderabad pahunch gai he
 Even after being associated with such a big business, after the accident, the statement of this company comes that it is 'act of God'
 pul ke girane se khud god kaa mandir dhwast ho gaya he
 Not God but the verandah of Goddess Kali's temple has also fallen due to the fall of this nominal bridge
 company ke is bayaan kii insaanon kii duniya main kaaphi aalochana hui he
 God did not come clean on his act, but the company that wrapped God in this act gave a clarification in Hyderabad that there may have been a blast
 shishe toote hai
 The company was given the first deadline of 18 months to build this bridge
 67 maheene biit gaye
 While the IVRCL company blames the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority for not delaying the delay for the delay, the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority alleges that the company is working too slowly
 lekin abhi aarope kya he
 The allegation is not why the bridge took so long to be built
 aarope yah he ki pul kaa saath meter kaa hissaa kaise gir gaya
 How did that new part fall? darasal 2002 main hyderabad neshnal games ke liye sports village banane vaali IVRCL karzon or nuksaan se buree tarah ghiri hui he
 The company has a debt of about 10,000 crores
 2015 disambar main iskaa ghaataa 2000 karod kaa ho gaya he
 The company wanted to increase the cost of construction of the bridge
 kiskaa daawa sahi-sahi or kiskaa galat yah kahana mushkil he lekin pul girane se 25 logon ko apni jaan jarur ganvaani padi he
 8 people of the company have been arrested in Kolkata, but they should not be spared if there is a government authority responsible for delay in construction of the bridge
 tippaniyan Now come to today's question
 kya fliover itane jaruri hai ki ham kahin bhi kaise bhi bana dete hai
 If you look at flyovers across the country, then you will get many such flyovers, if made of style
 chote shaharon main kuch fliowaron ko dekhakar to ji ghabara hi jaataa he
 The problem of traffic jams is increasing everywhere
 netaa bhi logon ko aashwast karne ke liye pliover kii aadharshila rakh dete hai
 In Delhi, in the last ten-fifteen years, close to a hundred flyovers would have been built
 is shahar ke anubhav se bataa saktaa hum ki kuch fliover to kaamyaab lagate hai lekin zyaadaatar fliover ke banane ke baad bhi jam kii samasya samaapt nahin hoti he
 Talk of building 50 flyovers in Mumbai has been going on for two decades
 bengalooru main 40 fliover ban gaye hai
 There are also plenty of flyovers in Chennai
 aae din akhabaaron main fliover ke shilanyas or udghaatan kii tasviren aap dekhte rahete hai lekin kya kabhi dekha he ki inase trephic kii samasya dur hoti bhi he yaa nahin
 Apart from traffic, it is also said that the flyover also affects the surrounding social system
 paryaavaran par bhi asar hota hi hoga
 Do you also think that the traffic jam problem has ended since the flyover came
 mere khud ke anubhav main to donon hi baaten hai
 If traffic has not been resolved from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi, then the Ghazipur flyover has solved a lot
 bachaav dal ne to kah diya ki 25 log mare hai lekin marane vaala koun tha? jo mara he ab uske parivaar kaa kya hoga? sanjay malhotra, tapan datta, aashaa joshi, edi ramjaani, gajendra sethiya, nirmal kumaar, sonia yadav, sunil vishwakarma, ranjit sahay yah naam hai un logon ke jo pul ke neeche dab kar mar gaye

 company ke is bayaan kii insaanon kii duniya main kaaphi aalochana hui he
 God did not come clean on his act, but the company that wrapped God in this act gave a clarification in Hyderabad that there may have been a blast
 shishe toote hai
 The company was given the first deadline of 18 months to build this bridge
 67 maheene biit gaye
 While the IVRCL company blames the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority for not delaying the delay for the delay, the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority alleges that the company is working too slowly
 lekin abhi aarope kya he
 The allegation is not why the bridge took so long to be built
 aarope yah he ki pul kaa saath meter kaa hissaa kaise gir gaya
 How did that new part fall? darasal 2002 main hyderabad neshnal games ke liye sports village banane vaali IVRCL karzon or nuksaan se buree tarah ghiri hui he
 The company has a debt of about 10,000 crores
 2015 disambar main iskaa ghaataa 2000 karod kaa ho gaya he
 The company wanted to increase the cost of construction of the bridge
 kiskaa daawa sahi-sahi or kiskaa galat yah kahana mushkil he lekin pul girane se 25 logon ko apni jaan jarur ganvaani padi he
 8 people of the company have been arrested in Kolkata, but they should not be spared if there is a government authority responsible for delay in construction of the bridge
 tippaniyan Now come to today's question
 kya fliover itane jaruri hai ki ham kahin bhi kaise bhi bana dete hai
 If you look at flyovers across the country, then you will get many such flyovers, if made of style
 chote shaharon main kuch fliowaron ko dekhakar to ji ghabara hi jaataa he
 The problem of traffic jams is increasing everywhere
 netaa bhi logon ko aashwast karne ke liye pliover kii aadharshila rakh dete hai
 In Delhi, in the last ten-fifteen years, close to a hundred flyovers would have been built
 is shahar ke anubhav se bataa saktaa hum ki kuch fliover to kaamyaab lagate hai lekin zyaadaatar fliover ke banane ke baad bhi jam kii samasya samaapt nahin hoti he
 Talk of building 50 flyovers in Mumbai has been going on for two decades
 bengalooru main 40 fliover ban gaye hai
 There are also plenty of flyovers in Chennai
 aae din akhabaaron main fliover ke shilanyas or udghaatan kii tasviren aap dekhte rahete hai lekin kya kabhi dekha he ki inase trephic kii samasya dur hoti bhi he yaa nahin
 Apart from traffic, it is also said that the flyover also affects the surrounding social system
 paryaavaran par bhi asar hota hi hoga
 Do you also think that the traffic jam problem has ended since the flyover came
 mere khud ke anubhav main to donon hi baaten hai
 If traffic has not been resolved from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi, then the Ghazipur flyover has solved a lot
 kolkata ke akhbaar sanhmaarg main mahadev adak ke bare main chapa he
 Mahadev was a cashier in a company of Bada Bazaar
 subah cash lene ke liye nikle hi the, pul gir gaya
 He was a resident of Baksada area of jagacha police station of Howrah
 unke ghar kaa intjaam koun dekhegaa
 There is an act of God for this
 kanoonee bhashaa he 'act aaf god' lekin ham bhul gaye hai kab kya or kaise bolnaa he
 According to Kolkata newspapers, there are 3 rickshaw drivers among those who died
 kuch abhi bhi laapata bataae ja rahe hai
 Shabana Bano had come to fetch her child from school, was buried under the bridge
 aakhri vakt main do baar ghar phone bhi kiya ki bachaa lo
 His body was taken out on Friday morning
 bada bazaar se kolkata nagar nigam or rajya sarkaar ko khub rajasav miltaa he lekin jab aap yahaan aaenge to lagegaa ki angrejon ke jane ke baad yahaan koi sarkaar ai hi nahin
 Generally, this is the case for such traditional markets
 is bazaar main har dal kaa daftar or jhanda dikhegaa
 Like everywhere, the business class has the highest contact in every party, but they are not able to fix the condition of their own market
 is pul kaa bananaa or girnaa donon hi raajnneetik vyavastha kii naakaami kaa pramaan he
 This bridge comes in ward number 23, 24, 25
 23 number ward se bijepi he
 24 and 25 are Trinamool Congress from the ward
 vidhayak or saansad donon trinmul congress se hai
 Rabindranath Tagore's house is exactly one hundred meters from where part of the bridge fell
 unheen ke ghar ke naam par vidhansabha kaa naam he
 There are Trinamool mlas
 aaj congress or bijepi ne aarope lagaaya he ki inke ek rishtedaar ke paas pul nirmaan ke liye lebar or material supplai kaa theka tha
 The bridge was being built under the Jawaharlal Urban Mission under the supervision of the state government
 uttar kolkata ke trinmul saansad sudeep bandhopadhyaay ne kaha he ki unhone rajya sarkaar se pul kii dizin kii shikaayat kii thi lekin tab tak 60 fisadi hissaa ban chukaa tha
 The foundation stone was laid in 2001, work started in 2008
 march 2016 main bhi nahin bana or gir hi gaya
 If a 60-meter-long bridge falls, weighing 140 tons, imagine how much effort it would have taken to remove debris
 kolkata police, sena ke jawan, andiaref, department aaf mins and jiyology, nigam ke ejeeniyar sahit paanch hajaar log jute hai
 Trinamool Congress leaders are accusing CPM
 sipiem vaale trinmul par aarope laga rahe hai
 If properly investigated, it will be known that the company building the bridge has the most relationships
 2011 se 2016 paanch saal tak trinmul kii sarkaar rahi
 Why doesn't anyone clearly explain why it was not made? Why has not the threat of danger been heard? Why did the Trinamool government not pay attention to its own MP? aap is fliover ko thik se dekhen to samaj main aa jayega ki yah ban bhi jaataa to kisi kahar se kam nahin hota
 The flyover has made all cities ugly
 yah fliover jis tarah se guzar rahaa he vah sateek udhaaharan he, yah samajhane kaa ki ham apane shaharon ke saath kya kar rahe hai
 Like a dry drain, this flyover adjoining the houses on both sides is flowing, Badrang, Benur and Bedrang
 dizine dekhakar lagata he bharat main ejineering or dizine kii padhai band ho gai he
 Neither understanding nor imagination can be seen
 is pul ko banane se pehle yah tak nahin sochaa gaya ki aasapaas ke makaanon or logon ke jivan par kya asar padegaa
 All these houses are sixty to seventy years old
 inke bich se do kilometre lanbaa pul gujaarne kaa khyaal kis mahaan vaigyanik kaa tha use hajir kiya janaa chahie
 The bridge is passing by touching the houses here
 itane kareeb se ki aap scale se naap sakate hai
 There is not even a foot difference
 koi ejineering fail hoga tab bhi aisi dizine nahin banayega
 Will keep a difference of at least five to six feet
 yahaan ke makaanon ke itane kareeb se guzar rahaa he ki khidkiyaan bhi nahin khul sakati hai
 Now tell me, if this bridge were built, what would be the impact on the houses here
 pul ke kampan se makaanon par kya asar padataa
 Which engineering college in the world is taught such a design that make a bridge or highway close to the window of the house
 kya yah sirf hindustan main ho saktaa he? kya yah sirf kolkata main ho saktaa he? pul nahin bhi girtaa to banane ke baad is pul par isse sate makaan gir jate
 People have also been sued
 vyapaariyon ne bhi iskaa virodh hi kiya he
 From the Left to the Trinamool Government, it must take responsibility for the bizarre and dangerous design of this bridge
 yah fliover kolkata ke kisi kone yaa kinare main nahin ban rahaa tha balki behad mahatvapurn jagah he
 There are hospitals around, coaching institutes, fruit and flower markets
 pushta main ise khatm hona tha jahaan kaaphi bada makaan he
 People there also have to test how they organize and fight their battles
 darasal log ladate hai magar vyavasthaaen unhen haraa hi detii hai
 Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee sat on the scene from noon to one o'clock on Thursday, monitoring the rescue work
 tamaam afasar maujuud the
 It is commendable to look at the aftermath of the incident that Mamata Banerjee is sitting on the road watching all the work but if she showed the same activity to the complaints related to it before the bridge collapsed, then this incident would not have been averted
 kya mamata banerjee yaa pul banane vaala vibhaag isaki dizine ko lekar puri tarah aashwast tha
 He had promised that the bridge would be built soon, but did he pay attention to what his own mps and local people were complaining about the bridge? ab aate hai company ji par
 Their name is IVRCL
 company ji kaa mukhyalay he hyderabad main
 It has 3000 engineers
 itani badi fouj he ejiniyaron kii iske paas
 The company has written on its site that this is the most difficult project of JNNURM
 puri tarah se steel kaa dhaancha he
 The 25-year-old company is involved in a variety of businesses
 jal or paryaavaran, sinchai, transportesan, building or industrial strecchar, bijli kii supplai, mining mentanence sahit kai kaarobaar hai iske
 The company is also listed on the National Stock Exchange and BSE
 andhrapradesh, madhyapradesh, maharashtra se lekar karnataka tak main is company ke paas theke hai
 An investigation into why the bridge fell has started and Kolkata Police has reached Hyderabad
 itane bade-bade kaarobaaron se jude rahane ke baad bhi haadase ke baad is company kaa bayaan aata he ki yah 'act aaf god' he
 The bridge itself has destroyed the temple of God
 god to nahin magar godes kaali ke mandir kaa baramada bhi gir gaya he is naamuraad pul ke girane se
 This statement of the company has drawn much criticism in the human world
 god kii taraf se apane act par safai to nahin ai magar god ko is act main lapetane vaali company ne hyderabad main safai di ki ho saktaa he ki dhamaakaa hua ho
 Mirrors are broken
 company ko is pul ko banane ke liye pehali dedline 18 maheene kii di gai thi
 67 months passed
 IVRCL company jahaan deree ke liye kolkata metropolitan deveopment athurity ko samay par jagah nahin dene kaa jimmedaar tehraati he vahiin kolkata metropolitan deveopment athurity kaa aarope he ki company bahut dhire kaam kar rahi he
 But what is the charge right now
 aarope yah nahin he ki pul banane main itnaa samay kyon laga
 The allegation is how the sixty meter section of the bridge collapsed
 wo bhi nayaa vaala hissaa kaise gira
 In fact, IVRCL, which formed the sports village for the Hyderabad National Games in 2002, is badly hit by debts and losses
 company par kareeb 10,000 karod kaa qarj he
 In 2015 December, its loss has been 2000 crores
 company pul ke nirmaan kii lagaat badhwaana chaahati thi
 It is difficult to say whose claims are right and what is wrong, but 25 people have lost their lives due to the fall of the bridge
 kolkata main company ke 8 logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he, lekin agar pul banane main deree kii jimmedaar sarkari athurity hai to unhen bhi baksha nahin janaa chahie
 The comments ab aate hai aaj ke sawaal par
 Are flyovers so important that we make them anywhere
 desh bhar main fliover ko dekhenge to aapako aise bahut se fliover milenge to dhang ke bane hon
 Seeing some flyovers in small towns makes one nervous
 har jagah trephic jam kii samasya badhati ja rahi he
 Leaders also lay the foundation of the plyover to reassure the people
 dilli main jahaan pichley das-pandrah saalon main sau ke kareeb fliover to bane hi honge
 i can tell from the experience of this city that some flyovers seem successful but even after the formation of most flyovers, the problem of jam does not end
 mumbai main 50 fliover banane kii baat do dashak se chal rahi he
 There are 40 flyovers in Bengaluru
 chennai main bhi khub fliover bane hai
 You keep looking at the photographs of the foundation and inauguration of the flyover in newspapers every day, but have you ever seen whether they will solve the problem of traffic or not
 trephic ke alaava yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki fliover kii vajah se aasapaas kii saamaajik vyavastha bhi prabhavit hoti he
 The environment will also be affected
 kya aapako bhi lagata he ki fliover aane ke baad se trephic jam kii samasya samaapt ho gai he
 In my own experience both these things are there
 agar dilli ke sarai kaale khan se trephic kaa hal nahin hua he to gajipur fliover banane se kaaphi kuch hal hua he

 In my own experience both these things are there
 agar dilli ke sarai kaale khan se trephic kaa hal nahin hua he to gajipur fliover banane se kaaphi kuch hal hua he
 Kolkata Municipal Corporation and the state government get a lot of revenue from Bada Bazaar, but when you come here, you will feel that no government came here after the British left
 aam taur par aise paaramparik bazaaron kaa yahi haal hota he
 Every party's office and flag will be seen in this market
 har jagah kii tarah vyapaarik varg kaa har dal main upar tak sampark he magar ve apane hi market kaa haal thik nahin kar pate hai
 The construction and fall of this bridge are both proof of the failure of the political system
 yah pul ward number 23, 24, 25 main aata he
 23 is BJP from ward
 24 or 25 number ward se trinmul congress he
 Both the MLA and MP are from Trinamool Congress
 rabindranath tagore kaa ghar thik sau meter kii duuri par he, jahaan pul kaa hissaa gira tha
 The assembly is named after his house
 vahaan se trinmul kii vidhayak hai
 Today, Congress and BJP have alleged that one of their relatives had labor and material supply contracts for the construction of the bridge
 yah pul rajya sarkaar kii nigaraanee main jawaharlal urban mishan ke tahat ban rahaa tha
 Trinamool MP from North Kolkata, Sudeep Bandhopadhyay, has said that he had complained to the state government about the design of the bridge but by then 60 per cent had been formed
 shilanyas hua tha iskaa 2001 main, kaam shuru hua 2008 main
 Did not even make and fell in March 2016
 60 meter lanbaa pul gir jaae, jiskaa vajan 140 ton ho to sochie malbe ko hataane main kitni mashkkat kerani padi hogi
 Five thousand people including Kolkata Police, Army Jawans, NDRF, Department of Mines and Geology, Corporation Engineers have gathered
 trinmul congress ke netaa sipiem par aarope laga rahe hai
 CPM people are accusing Trinamool
 thik se jaanch ho jaae to pataa chalegaa ki pul banane vaali company ke sabase rishte hai
 The Trinamool government was in power for five years from 2011 to 2016
 koi saaf-saaf kyon nahin bataata ki kyon nahin bana? kyon nahin khatre kii ashanka ke bare main suna gaya? trinmul sarkaar ne apane hi saansad kii baat par dhyaan kyon nahin diya? If you look at this flyover properly, it will be understood that even if it were built, it would not have caused any havoc
 fliover ne tamaam shaharon ko badsoorat kar diya he
 The exact way this flyover is going through is an example of understanding what we are doing with our cities
 kisi sookhe naale kii tarah donon taraf ke makaanon se sate yah fliover bahata chalaa aa rahaa he, badrang, benur or beong
 Looking at design, it seems that engineering and design studies have stopped in India
 na samaj, na kalpana dikhti he
 Before constructing this bridge, it was not even thought about how it would affect the lives of the surrounding houses and people
 yah saare makaan saath se sattar saal puraane hai
 The thought of which great scientist to pass a two kilometer long bridge between them should be present
 pul yahaan ke makaanon ko chhukar guzar rahaa he
 So close that you can scale
 ek foot kaa bhi antar nahin he
 Even if there is an engineering failure, we will not make such a design
 kam se paanch se chah foot kaa antar to rakhega
 The houses here are passing so close that even the windows cannot open
 ab aap bataaie yah pul ban jaataa to yahaan ke makaanon par kya asar padataa
 How would the vibration of the bridge affect the houses
 duniya ke kis ejineering kalege main aisi dizine padhai jaati he ki ghar kii khidki se sataakar pul yaa haive bana do
 Can this happen only in India? Can this happen only in Kolkata? If the bridge did not fall, then the houses adjacent to it would fall on this bridge
 logon ne mukadmaa bhi kiya hua he
 Traders have also opposed this
 vampanth se lekar trinmul sarkaar ko is pul kii vicitra or khatarnaak dizine kii to jimmedaari leni hi chahie
 This flyover was not being built in any corner or side of Kolkata but is a very important place
 aasapaas aspataal hai, koching santhaan hai, fal or phool kii mandi he
 It was to end in Pushta where there is a very big house
 vahaan ke logon kaa bhi imtahaan he ki ve kaise sangathit hokar apni ladaai ladate hai
 Actually people fight but the systems beat them
 mukhyamantri mamata banerjee guuruuvaar ko dopaher se lekar raat ke ek baje tak ghatnasthal par baithkar bachaav kaary kii nigaraanee karti raheen
 All officers were present
 ghatana ke baad kii najar se dekhen to saraahneey he ki mamata banerjee sadak par baithkar sara kaam dekh rahi hai lekin yahi sakriyata pul girane se pehle ve isse judi shikayaton ke prati dikhaatin to kya yah haadasa tal nahin jaataa
 Was Mamata Banerjee or the bridge-making department fully confident of its design
 unhone to vaada kiya tha ki pul jaldi banegaa lekin kya unhone dhyaan diya tha ki pul ko lekar unke hi saansad or sthaneey log kya shikaayat kar rahe the? Now come to company inkaa naam he IVRCL
 The company is headquartered in Hyderabad
 iske paas 3000 ejeeniyar hai
 It has such a large army of engineers
 company ne apni site par likhaa he ki yah JNNURM kaa yah sabase mushkil project he
 The structure is entirely steel
 25 saal puraani yah company kai tarah ke kaarobaar se judi he
 It has many businesses including water and environment, irrigation, transportation, building and industrial structures, power supply, mining maintenance
 company neshnal stock exange or bisai main listed bhi he
 The company has contracts in Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra to Karnataka
 pul kyon gira isaki jaanch shuru ho gai he or kolkata kii police hyderabad pahunch gai he
 Even after being associated with such a big business, after the accident, the statement of this company comes that it is 'act of God'
 pul ke girane se khud god kaa mandir dhwast ho gaya he
 Not God but the verandah of Goddess Kali's temple has also fallen due to the fall of this nominal bridge
 company ke is bayaan kii insaanon kii duniya main kaaphi aalochana hui he
 God did not come clean on his act, but the company that wrapped God in this act gave a clarification in Hyderabad that there may have been a blast
 shishe toote hai
 The company was given the first deadline of 18 months to build this bridge
 67 maheene biit gaye
 While the IVRCL company blames the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority for not delaying the delay for the delay, the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority alleges that the company is working too slowly
 lekin abhi aarope kya he
 The allegation is not why the bridge took so long to be built
 aarope yah he ki pul kaa saath meter kaa hissaa kaise gir gaya
 How did that new part fall? darasal 2002 main hyderabad neshnal games ke liye sports village banane vaali IVRCL karzon or nuksaan se buree tarah ghiri hui he
 The company has a debt of about 10,000 crores
 2015 disambar main iskaa ghaataa 2000 karod kaa ho gaya he
 The company wanted to increase the cost of construction of the bridge
 kiskaa daawa sahi-sahi or kiskaa galat yah kahana mushkil he lekin pul girane se 25 logon ko apni jaan jarur ganvaani padi he
 8 people of the company have been arrested in Kolkata, but they should not be spared if there is a government authority responsible for delay in construction of the bridge
 tippaniyan Now come to today's question
 kya fliover itane jaruri hai ki ham kahin bhi kaise bhi bana dete hai
 If you look at flyovers across the country, then you will get many such flyovers, if made of style
 chote shaharon main kuch fliowaron ko dekhakar to ji ghabara hi jaataa he
 The problem of traffic jams is increasing everywhere
 netaa bhi logon ko aashwast karne ke liye pliover kii aadharshila rakh dete hai
 In Delhi, in the last ten-fifteen years, close to a hundred flyovers would have been built
 is shahar ke anubhav se bataa saktaa hum ki kuch fliover to kaamyaab lagate hai lekin zyaadaatar fliover ke banane ke baad bhi jam kii samasya samaapt nahin hoti he
 Talk of building 50 flyovers in Mumbai has been going on for two decades
 bengalooru main 40 fliover ban gaye hai
 There are also plenty of flyovers in Chennai
 aae din akhabaaron main fliover ke shilanyas or udghaatan kii tasviren aap dekhte rahete hai lekin kya kabhi dekha he ki inase trephic kii samasya dur hoti bhi he yaa nahin
 Apart from traffic, it is also said that the flyover also affects the surrounding social system
 paryaavaran par bhi asar hota hi hoga
 Do you also think that the traffic jam problem has ended since the flyover came
 mere khud ke anubhav main to donon hi baaten hai
 If traffic has not been resolved from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi, then the Ghazipur flyover has solved a lot
 yah pul ward number 23, 24, 25 main aata he
 23 is BJP from ward
 24 or 25 number ward se trinmul congress he
 Both the MLA and MP are from Trinamool Congress
 rabindranath tagore kaa ghar thik sau meter kii duuri par he, jahaan pul kaa hissaa gira tha
 The assembly is named after his house
 vahaan se trinmul kii vidhayak hai
 Today, Congress and BJP have alleged that one of their relatives had labor and material supply contracts for the construction of the bridge
 yah pul rajya sarkaar kii nigaraanee main jawaharlal urban mishan ke tahat ban rahaa tha
 Trinamool MP from North Kolkata, Sudeep Bandhopadhyay, has said that he had complained to the state government about the design of the bridge but by then 60 per cent had been formed
 shilanyas hua tha iskaa 2001 main, kaam shuru hua 2008 main
 Did not even make and fell in March 2016
 60 meter lanbaa pul gir jaae, jiskaa vajan 140 ton ho to sochie malbe ko hataane main kitni mashkkat kerani padi hogi
 Five thousand people including Kolkata Police, Army Jawans, NDRF, Department of Mines and Geology, Corporation Engineers have gathered
 trinmul congress ke netaa sipiem par aarope laga rahe hai
 CPM people are accusing Trinamool
 thik se jaanch ho jaae to pataa chalegaa ki pul banane vaali company ke sabase rishte hai
 The Trinamool government was in power for five years from 2011 to 2016
 koi saaf-saaf kyon nahin bataata ki kyon nahin bana? kyon nahin khatre kii ashanka ke bare main suna gaya? trinmul sarkaar ne apane hi saansad kii baat par dhyaan kyon nahin diya? If you look at this flyover properly, it will be understood that even if it were built, it would not have caused any havoc
 fliover ne tamaam shaharon ko badsoorat kar diya he
 The exact way this flyover is going through is an example of understanding what we are doing with our cities
 kisi sookhe naale kii tarah donon taraf ke makaanon se sate yah fliover bahata chalaa aa rahaa he, badrang, benur or beong
 Looking at design, it seems that engineering and design studies have stopped in India
 na samaj, na kalpana dikhti he
 Before constructing this bridge, it was not even thought about how it would affect the lives of the surrounding houses and people
 yah saare makaan saath se sattar saal puraane hai
 The thought of which great scientist to pass a two kilometer long bridge between them should be present
 pul yahaan ke makaanon ko chhukar guzar rahaa he
 So close that you can scale
 ek foot kaa bhi antar nahin he
 Even if there is an engineering failure, we will not make such a design
 kam se paanch se chah foot kaa antar to rakhega
 The houses here are passing so close that even the windows cannot open
 ab aap bataaie yah pul ban jaataa to yahaan ke makaanon par kya asar padataa
 How would the vibration of the bridge affect the houses
 duniya ke kis ejineering kalege main aisi dizine padhai jaati he ki ghar kii khidki se sataakar pul yaa haive bana do
 Can this happen only in India? Can this happen only in Kolkata? If the bridge did not fall, then the houses adjacent to it would fall on this bridge
 logon ne mukadmaa bhi kiya hua he
 Traders have also opposed this
 vampanth se lekar trinmul sarkaar ko is pul kii vicitra or khatarnaak dizine kii to jimmedaari leni hi chahie
 This flyover was not being built in any corner or side of Kolkata but is a very important place
 aasapaas aspataal hai, koching santhaan hai, fal or phool kii mandi he
 It was to end in Pushta where there is a very big house
 vahaan ke logon kaa bhi imtahaan he ki ve kaise sangathit hokar apni ladaai ladate hai
 Actually people fight but the systems beat them
 mukhyamantri mamata banerjee guuruuvaar ko dopaher se lekar raat ke ek baje tak ghatnasthal par baithkar bachaav kaary kii nigaraanee karti raheen
 All officers were present
 ghatana ke baad kii najar se dekhen to saraahneey he ki mamata banerjee sadak par baithkar sara kaam dekh rahi hai lekin yahi sakriyata pul girane se pehle ve isse judi shikayaton ke prati dikhaatin to kya yah haadasa tal nahin jaataa
 Was Mamata Banerjee or the bridge-making department fully confident of its design
 unhone to vaada kiya tha ki pul jaldi banegaa lekin kya unhone dhyaan diya tha ki pul ko lekar unke hi saansad or sthaneey log kya shikaayat kar rahe the? Now come to company inkaa naam he IVRCL
 The company is headquartered in Hyderabad
 iske paas 3000 ejeeniyar hai
 It has such a large army of engineers
 company ne apni site par likhaa he ki yah JNNURM kaa yah sabase mushkil project he
 The structure is entirely steel
 25 saal puraani yah company kai tarah ke kaarobaar se judi he
 It has many businesses including water and environment, irrigation, transportation, building and industrial structures, power supply, mining maintenance
 company neshnal stock exange or bisai main listed bhi he
 The company has contracts in Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra to Karnataka
 pul kyon gira isaki jaanch shuru ho gai he or kolkata kii police hyderabad pahunch gai he
 Even after being associated with such a big business, after the accident, the statement of this company comes that it is 'act of God'
 pul ke girane se khud god kaa mandir dhwast ho gaya he
 Not God but the verandah of Goddess Kali's temple has also fallen due to the fall of this nominal bridge
 company ke is bayaan kii insaanon kii duniya main kaaphi aalochana hui he
 God did not come clean on his act, but the company that wrapped God in this act gave a clarification in Hyderabad that there may have been a blast
 shishe toote hai
 The company was given the first deadline of 18 months to build this bridge
 67 maheene biit gaye
 While the IVRCL company blames the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority for not delaying the delay for the delay, the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority alleges that the company is working too slowly
 lekin abhi aarope kya he
 The allegation is not why the bridge took so long to be built
 aarope yah he ki pul kaa saath meter kaa hissaa kaise gir gaya
 How did that new part fall? darasal 2002 main hyderabad neshnal games ke liye sports village banane vaali IVRCL karzon or nuksaan se buree tarah ghiri hui he
 The company has a debt of about 10,000 crores
 2015 disambar main iskaa ghaataa 2000 karod kaa ho gaya he
 The company wanted to increase the cost of construction of the bridge
 kiskaa daawa sahi-sahi or kiskaa galat yah kahana mushkil he lekin pul girane se 25 logon ko apni jaan jarur ganvaani padi he
 8 people of the company have been arrested in Kolkata, but they should not be spared if there is a government authority responsible for delay in construction of the bridge
 tippaniyan Now come to today's question
 kya fliover itane jaruri hai ki ham kahin bhi kaise bhi bana dete hai
 If you look at flyovers across the country, then you will get many such flyovers, if made of style
 chote shaharon main kuch fliowaron ko dekhakar to ji ghabara hi jaataa he
 The problem of traffic jams is increasing everywhere
 netaa bhi logon ko aashwast karne ke liye pliover kii aadharshila rakh dete hai
 In Delhi, in the last ten-fifteen years, close to a hundred flyovers would have been built
 is shahar ke anubhav se bataa saktaa hum ki kuch fliover to kaamyaab lagate hai lekin zyaadaatar fliover ke banane ke baad bhi jam kii samasya samaapt nahin hoti he
 Talk of building 50 flyovers in Mumbai has been going on for two decades
 bengalooru main 40 fliover ban gaye hai
 There are also plenty of flyovers in Chennai
 aae din akhabaaron main fliover ke shilanyas or udghaatan kii tasviren aap dekhte rahete hai lekin kya kabhi dekha he ki inase trephic kii samasya dur hoti bhi he yaa nahin

 Do you also think that the traffic jam problem has ended since the flyover came
 mere khud ke anubhav main to donon hi baaten hai
 If traffic has not been resolved from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi, then the Ghazipur flyover has solved a lot
 aap is fliover ko thik se dekhen to samaj main aa jayega ki yah ban bhi jaataa to kisi kahar se kam nahin hota
 The flyover has made all cities ugly
 yah fliover jis tarah se guzar rahaa he vah sateek udhaaharan he, yah samajhane kaa ki ham apane shaharon ke saath kya kar rahe hai
 Like a dry drain, this flyover adjoining the houses on both sides is flowing, Badrang, Benur and Bedrang
 dizine dekhakar lagata he bharat main ejineering or dizine kii padhai band ho gai he
 Neither understanding nor imagination can be seen
 is pul ko banane se pehle yah tak nahin sochaa gaya ki aasapaas ke makaanon or logon ke jivan par kya asar padegaa
 All these houses are sixty to seventy years old
 inke bich se do kilometre lanbaa pul gujaarne kaa khyaal kis mahaan vaigyanik kaa tha use hajir kiya janaa chahie
 The bridge is passing by touching the houses here
 itane kareeb se ki aap scale se naap sakate hai
 There is not even a foot difference
 koi ejineering fail hoga tab bhi aisi dizine nahin banayega
 Will keep a difference of at least five to six feet
 yahaan ke makaanon ke itane kareeb se guzar rahaa he ki khidkiyaan bhi nahin khul sakati hai
 Now tell me, if this bridge were built, what would be the impact on the houses here
 pul ke kampan se makaanon par kya asar padataa
 Which engineering college in the world is taught such a design that make a bridge or highway close to the window of the house
 kya yah sirf hindustan main ho saktaa he? kya yah sirf kolkata main ho saktaa he? pul nahin bhi girtaa to banane ke baad is pul par isse sate makaan gir jate
 People have also been sued
 vyapaariyon ne bhi iskaa virodh hi kiya he
 From the Left to the Trinamool Government, it must take responsibility for the bizarre and dangerous design of this bridge
 yah fliover kolkata ke kisi kone yaa kinare main nahin ban rahaa tha balki behad mahatvapurn jagah he
 There are hospitals around, coaching institutes, fruit and flower markets
 pushta main ise khatm hona tha jahaan kaaphi bada makaan he
 People there also have to test how they organize and fight their battles
 darasal log ladate hai magar vyavasthaaen unhen haraa hi detii hai
 Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee sat on the scene from noon to one o'clock on Thursday, monitoring the rescue work
 tamaam afasar maujuud the
 It is commendable to look at the aftermath of the incident that Mamata Banerjee is sitting on the road watching all the work but if she showed the same activity to the complaints related to it before the bridge collapsed, then this incident would not have been averted
 kya mamata banerjee yaa pul banane vaala vibhaag isaki dizine ko lekar puri tarah aashwast tha
 He had promised that the bridge would be built soon, but did he pay attention to what his own mps and local people were complaining about the bridge? ab aate hai company ji par
 Their name is IVRCL
 company ji kaa mukhyalay he hyderabad main
 It has 3000 engineers
 itani badi fouj he ejiniyaron kii iske paas
 The company has written on its site that this is the most difficult project of JNNURM
 puri tarah se steel kaa dhaancha he
 The 25-year-old company is involved in a variety of businesses
 jal or paryaavaran, sinchai, transportesan, building or industrial strecchar, bijli kii supplai, mining mentanence sahit kai kaarobaar hai iske
 The company is also listed on the National Stock Exchange and BSE
 andhrapradesh, madhyapradesh, maharashtra se lekar karnataka tak main is company ke paas theke hai
 An investigation into why the bridge fell has started and Kolkata Police has reached Hyderabad
 itane bade-bade kaarobaaron se jude rahane ke baad bhi haadase ke baad is company kaa bayaan aata he ki yah 'act aaf god' he
 The bridge itself has destroyed the temple of God
 god to nahin magar godes kaali ke mandir kaa baramada bhi gir gaya he is naamuraad pul ke girane se
 This statement of the company has drawn much criticism in the human world
 god kii taraf se apane act par safai to nahin ai magar god ko is act main lapetane vaali company ne hyderabad main safai di ki ho saktaa he ki dhamaakaa hua ho
 Mirrors are broken
 company ko is pul ko banane ke liye pehali dedline 18 maheene kii di gai thi
 67 months passed
 IVRCL company jahaan deree ke liye kolkata metropolitan deveopment athurity ko samay par jagah nahin dene kaa jimmedaar tehraati he vahiin kolkata metropolitan deveopment athurity kaa aarope he ki company bahut dhire kaam kar rahi he
 But what is the charge right now
 aarope yah nahin he ki pul banane main itnaa samay kyon laga
 The allegation is how the sixty meter section of the bridge collapsed
 wo bhi nayaa vaala hissaa kaise gira
