 bihar main teji se badalte raajnneetik ghatnakram ke bich rashtriya lok samta party (RLSP) ne abhi NDA kaa saath nahin choda he
 However, the party's national president and union minister Upendra Kushwaha has rejected the bjp's proposal on seat sharing and gave an ultimatum till November
 rashtriya lok samta party (RLSP) ke adhyaksh upendra kushvaha lambey samay se 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav par seat bantwaare ko lekar sammanjanak seat die jane kii baat karte rahe hai, or aisa nahin hone par NDA kaa daaman chhodane kaa ishaara bhi kai baar kar chuke hai
 The national executive meeting of the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party in Patna on Saturday was considered to be very important for the possibility of remaining in the NDA in which Kushwaha had to take a decision
 lekin baithak ke baad kushvaha ne bijepi ko thodaa or vakt dene kaa elaan kiya
 Giving an ultimatum to the BJP, he gave time to resolve the seat-sharing issue by the end of this month
 unhone kaha ki is masale par party kii ore se abhi kuch bhi faisla nahin liya jayega
 He will try to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on this issue
 rajya ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke neech vaale bayaan par kushvaha ne kaha ki unhone apana bayaan waapas le liya he
 On November 28, Jotiba Phule's birthday will be celebrated as a high-low protest day
 sutron ke mutabik kushvaha chaahate hai ki bijepi unhen loksabhaa chunaav ke liye 3 seat de, lekin bijepi unhen keval 2 siten dene ke mood main he jisko lekar kushvaha kaaphi naaraaz hai
 At the same time, Kushwaha also made a point about Nitish Kumar allegedly being called 'neech' and told the Chief Minister a good deal
 2 vidhayakon ne banaai duriisse pehle party kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main party ke 2 vidhayak hissaa lene nahin pahunche
 The party's two mlas Sudhanshu Shekhar and Lallan Paswan kept their distance from the executive meeting
 kushvaha ke jane se fark nahin padegaa: jediuvahin, is baithak se pehle jediu pradesh adhyaksh vashishtha narayan singh ne kaha tha ki upendra kushvaha ke NDA se baahar jane kii sthiti main gathbandhan par koi asar nahin padegaa
 The NDA alliance in Bihar is very strong and it does not matter who joins the alliance or who leaves
 kuch maheenon main ralospa or jediu ke bich takaraar kii sthiti paidaa ho gai he
 The altercation between Upendra Kushwaha and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is not new but recently Kushwaha alleged that Nitish Kumar allegedly addressed him as "neech" during an event
 iske baad se hi kushvaha un par kaaphi aakraamak ho gaye hai
 Last month, BJP National President Amit Shah and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had announced that JDU and BJP will contest the same seats in Bihar in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 is elaan ke baad se hi upendra kushvaha kii party ke andar halchal bad gai
 NDA constituents Lok Janshakti Party and JDU have condemned Upendra Kushwahake as an attacker on Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 jediu ke netaaon ne yahaan tak kah diya he ki upendra kushvaha kii party endie main rahe yaa naa rahe koi fark padane vaala nahin he
 Apparently, Upendra Kushwaha's party has been completely isolated in the NDA
 shuukravaar ko bhi upendra kushvaha ne dilli main amit shah se siton ke talmail ko lekar baatcheet karne kii koshish kii magar unhen dwaara vakt nahin mila
 In such a situation, the meeting of the National Executive of the National Lok Samata Party on Saturday has become very important
 aisa mana ja rahaa he is baithak main upendra kushvaha party kii aage kii ranneeti ko lekar koi bada faisla kar sakate hai
 i am now in the NDA and will stay: Kushwaha: Earlier, Union Minister and NDA colleague Kushwaha told 'aaj Tak' that he wanted to meet Amit Shah for seat sharing but he could not meet
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki ve abhi NDA main hai or rahenge
 On the question of asking for more seats, Kushwaha said that 'how many seats we had asked for, it cannot be made public but i can definitely say that our party's strength has increased compared to last time, according to which we should get seats
 aage kii ranneeti ke liye party kii baithak he
 The opinion of the leaders will be taken
 uske aadhaar par faisla hoga

 bahujan samaaj party (bispi) kii rashtriya adhyaksh mayawati ne shuukravaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 The BSP supremo said that Narendra Modi's allegation of the alliance being racist is ridiculous and immature
 unhone ek anya twit main likhaa, "modi ji apane ko jabardasti pichhadaa banaakar raajnneetik swaarth ke liye jatvaad kaa khulkar istemaal karte hai, ve agar janm se pichde hote to kya RSS unhen kabhi bhi pradhanmantri banane detaa?mayawati ne kaha ki vaise bhi shri kalyaan singh jaison kaa aresas ne kya bura haal kiya he, kya yah desh nahin dekh rahaa he
 "significantly, during a public meeting, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had described the SP-BSP alliance as' Great Depression 'and said that these parties have only one mantra,' Casting caste, public good
 'mayawati or pradhanmantri modi ke aarope-pratyarope ke baad jati kaa mudda phir chunaav prachaar ke centre main aata dikh rahaa he
 The reason behind this is being told that in Bihar, UP and Jharkhand, where the elections are yet to be held, caste factor has been playing a big role in polarization of votes
 pradhanmantri modi kii jati kaa mudda nayaa nahin he or gaahe-bagaahe is par bahes chalati rahi he
 As Narendra Modi himself said on May 7, 2014, 'brothers, it is a fact of history that i was born in a low caste but i give confidence to the nation, my politics is not low level
 main paidaa hua hum nichi jati main lekin meraa sapana he ek bharat shreshth bharat
 In 2014, when Narendra Modi used to be the Chief Minister of Gujarat, for the first time as the bjp's PM Candidate, he revealed his birth in the backward caste to the country
 lekin pichley varshon main piem modi jati par or nae bayaan saamne aae, jiske bare main piem modi haal hi main desh ko avgat karvaa chuke hai
 Prime Minister Modi said in Kannauj on 27 April, 'for you to be born in a backward caste will be a game of politics, for me being born in a backward caste is a privilege to serve Mother Bharati and nothing else
 or bahan ji mahamilavati log meri jati to itani choti he, gaanv main ekaadh ghar bhi nahin hota he or main to pichhadaa nahin ati pichde main paidaa hua hum
 'this is the speech of 27 April which PM Modi gave in Kannauj and considered his luck to be born in a very backward caste but Mayawati does not believe that
 mayawati ne kaha, 'narendra modi janm se obisi nahin hai isliye unhone jatvaad kaa dansh nahin jhela he
 It should not be misinformed that our alliance is taking votes in the name of caste
 ye sahi nahin tha
 Modi has been forcibly using casteism by calling himself backward
 'piem modi janm se obisi yani pichhadi jati ke hai yaa modi ke gujarat kaa mukhyamantri banane ke baad unki jati ko pichhadaa jati ghoshit kiya gaya, ye wo sawaal he jisapar sanshay barkaraar he
 The Mod Ghanchi caste that PM Modi comes from is also called Teli or Sahu in many states
 modh ghanchi jati ko gujarat main samrudh mana jaataa he or pehle ye jati savarnon main gini jaati thi
 In May 2014, the Gujarat government claimed that Modh Ghanchi caste was included in the OBC category in 1994 itself
 jiske saboot ke taur par gujarat sarkaar ne 25 july 1994 ko jari hua notification pesh kiya jiske jariye modh ghanchi samet 36 jatiyon ko obisi category main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 This means that the caste of PM Modi was given the status of backward caste when Narendra Modi did not become the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 gujarat sarkaar ne ek circular ke aadhaar par may 2014 main congress netaa shakti singh gohil ne aarope lagaaya ki modi ne mukhyamantri banane ke baad apni jati ko obisi category main shaamil karwaane ke liye jodtod kii thi
 Shakti Singh Gohil said on 9 May 2014, 'modi was never in the backward caste when he was born or grew up
 modi modh ghanchi hai
 There are Vaishyas, there are upper castes but the families with big money used to come from that
 'yani piem modi janm se pichhadi jati ke hai yaa unhone mukhyamantri banane ke baad apni jati ko obisi category main shaamil karvaa liya, isko lekar bijepi or congress ke apane-apane daawey hai lekin mayawati kaa to ek daawa or bhi he
 As Mayawati said on Friday, 'if Modi were backward from birth, would RSS have made him Prime Minister
 vaise bhi kalyaan singh jaison kaa kya haal kiya he, ye desh sab jaanata he
 However, the electoral debate on the pm's caste is at its peak
 chunaav kii har khabar milegi sidhe aapke inbox main
 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to the upcoming Election Special News Letter vah 1996 kaa saal tha
 i was present at the Edgbaston grounds in Birmingham in England
 england aath wicket se match jeet gaya tha
 It was not a high-scoring match
 lekin vah match mujhe hi nahin balki or bhi kai logon ko duusari pari main england ke gendbaajon kii sachin tendulkar ke haathon kii gai dhulaai kii vajah se yaad rah gaya
 It was the fourth inning on that pitch and the fast bowlers were getting more help, the ball was rotating and waving randomly
 phir bhi sachin ne us vakt aag ugal rahe kris levis ko akele hi thikaane laga diya
 Of India's total of 219 runs, 122 were made by Sachin alone
 unke alaava sanjay manjrekar hi sabase zyada 18 ran bana paae the
 The discipline and focus required to play such a difficult innings cannot be achieved by employing both rhythm and aggression
 lekin sachin ne donon kaa hi yakeenan durlabh pradarshan kiya
 We were all surprised to see that the havoc bowling attack was battling fearlessly alone while his fellow batsmen from the other end were leaving the field in the pose of 'tu Chal Main Aata Hain'
 meri samaj main yah dilari sirf vahi dikhaa saktaa he jiske paas aisi takneekee kshamta ho ki ek ke baad duusari kaa bakhubi istemaal kar sake
 It can do only those who have been two-four before their weaknesses and discovered their cut
 aisi kamajoriyaan jinhone apekshaakrit kam kuwwat vaale kai khiladinnon ko nigal liya
 Over the years, i have seen Sachin so many times and from so many aspects that it has now become difficult for me to say which innings, matches or aspects of him i liked best
 koi moti misaal deni ho to main australia ke ek bharat daure main shen warn se takkar lene kii unki taiyaari ko yaad karuunga
 Common sense would say that the Indian batsmen should be ready to face the Australian fast bowling, considering the mood of the time, but friends, common sense is often deceived
 pichen agar spin gendbaaji ko madad karne vaali hon to tej gendbaaji se mukaable kii taiyaari karne kii kya tuk he bhala?bhartiya team main is baat ko samajhane vaale sachin shaayad iklaute khilaadi the
 So, he requested Laxman Sivaramakrishnan to bowl a little round the wicket for his practice, also at the place where the bowlers' feet become a pit
 uskaa kya nateeja kya hua, aap use itihaas ke pannon main dekh sakate hai
 It is no use repeating it here
 mujhe vah abhyaas satr ek tarah se dur tak soch lene vaali sachin kii us khubi kii vajah se hi yaad rah gaya
 i thought, what a batter it is! Where this can be cheated, this guy is already busy preparing for it
 or yahaan yah baat gaur karne laayak he ki ve sirf practice nahin kar rahe the
 Many people practice hard
 lekin sirf practice karne se hi baat nahin banati
 Considering all kinds of circumstances, until perfect practice, then it does not make any sense
 agar aap galat chizon kii practice kiye chale ja rahe hai to aap to galat karne main hi or kaabil hote chale jaaenge naa
 Throughout his career, Sachin has shown how cautious he has been about correct practice
 or isse unhen man mutabik footwork hasil karne main madad mili he
 Achieving this footwork of the player gives any coach an opportunity to swing happily
 agar aap pichley dedhek saal ke unke pradarshan ko bhula den‚Äîaapako bhula dena chahie kyonki yah to bahut hi swaabhaavik baat he‚Äîto maine unhen kabhi galat pair baahar nikaalte nahin dekha he
 Like any dancer who has mastered his art, Sachin has adopted a perfect pose for him every time he plays his shot
 isaki vajah yah he, jaisaa ki main haal hi main britain ke pradhanmantri david camran ko bataa rahaa tha, sabase pehle aapako apane pair jamaane kii jarurat hoti he
 Your hands and arms are automatically set in their right place
 sachin ke maamle main to footwork kii ahmiyat or bhi bad jaati he kyonki sunil gavaskar kii tarah ve bhi kad main chote hai
 And batsmen of short stature make small strides to move forward
 agar aapkaa footwork sahi nahin he or aapke pair dedhek foot hi baahar aate hai or aap gend kii pich se kaaphi dur hai to aapke liye maamla khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 You will get jammed at your place
 idhar ke 18 maheenon ko chhod den to maine sachin ko itane kamjor footwork ke saath nahin dekha
 Now his footsteps have stopped moving that way, and i think that was to happen
 isi ko to vakt kehete hai
 Is it not? Another important aspect of Sachin's technique has been his ability to read the length of the ball
 or main is baat ke liye unka divaana rahaa hum
 i might not need to disclose this much but we have seen that many batsmen, when they have to play on the front foot, are seen playing on the backfoot and when playing on the backfoot, on the front foot
 aisa lagaataar hota aayaa he
 Even a capable player like Mahendra Singh Dhoni recently caught the wicketkeeper in the Kolkata Test against the West Indies
 vajah? vahi
 Instead of overtaking, he stayed on the hind leg
 yah sab aap sachin ke saath hota hua nahin paaenge, amuman
 This fellow has a great ability to guess the length
 or yahi baat to vaaki myne rakhti he‚Äîfootwork or gend kii lambaai kii samajhadaari
 These are basic techniques for any good batsman or say it should be
 sachin ke khel kii khubsuurati yah rahi he ki ve yah sab badi sahajata se karte hai
 These are largely the reasons why he has been able to play any type of bowling easily on any kind of pitch
 inhen vajahon se unhen zyada takat lagaae bagaiyr umdaa drive, cat or pul shot khilne main aasaani rahi he
 This kind of understanding and physical balance can be achieved only after constant and hour-to-hour practice
 isamen saamaanya or paramparaagat tareekon ke alaava har baar achaanak anokhe upaay bhi sujh jate hai
 If anyone has looked closely, he would have come to know that Sachin's feet are always in the line between the two wickets
 balla hameshaa of stump kii line main hota he or baclift kuch is tarah se hoti he, jisase balle ko aage laakar shot khilne main aasaani ho
 The real reason for the strength with which they play the shot is that they are able to apply the strength of the body with full balance
 aap unki har pari ke peeche ek tarah kii nishchit yojana ko bhaanp sakate hai
 After that the technique is like a cherry in the game of Sachin
 ve takanic kaa mahaj takanic ke taur par istemaal nahin karte
 Although many times feel that this is not possible but they give such an impression that as they have prepared for every ball of every innings, they have studied every bowler thoroughly and thoughtfully about every shot
 yahi to he jo unhen 'game controlar‚Äô or kai maukon par 'game changer‚Äô kii bhoomika main laa detaa he
 It is no shame that there is a gradual decline in one's game
 jaisaa ki sachin ke saath hua he
 i can also understand his longing to play continuously
 in tamaam kism ke utaar-chadhaavon ke bich aisa kabhi nahin laga ki sachin khel kaa anand nahin uthaa rahe hai
 And now that he has decided to say goodbye to it, he is also perfect like every shot of him

 According to the new revised rule of Delhi government, schools will not have the right of admission under 20% management quota
 sanshodhit niyam main elumanai criteria ko bhi scrap kar diya gaya he
 Nursery Admission: Schools giving Neighborhood Honors marks to the school bus area! According to the new rule, in 75% of the open seats of nursery admission, the school will first admit children in the range of 0-1 km
 inamen sabase pehle un bacchon ko daakhila milegaa jinke bhai-bahan usee skool main padhate hai
 That is, under the Sibling Criteria, children living in the range of 0-1 km will be given priority in admission
 nursery admician: ye tips aasaan kar denge har kaam-agar 0-1 kilometre kii range main sibling criteria ke liye aavednon kii sankhya skool kii seat se zyada hoti he to dra ke jariye daakhila hoga
 - If seats remain vacant in the school even after sibling admission in the range of 0-1 km, then the school will give first admission to the children living within the range of 0-1 km
 aavedan zyada hone par dra kiya jayega
 Similarly, if the school seat is vacant, they will be able to enroll the children who live within the radius of 1-3 km and thereafter 3-6 km
 -nursery daakhile main skool kii 25 % siten EWS / DG category ke liye hogi
 These 298 schools are the ones who signed an agreement while acquiring land from the DDA
 jiske mutabik ye nebarhud ke bacchon ko admician dene se manaa nahin kar sakate
 However, the Neighborhood was not yet defined
 lekin nai guideline ke mutabik ye skool apane nebarhud bacchon ko admician dene se manaa nahin kar sakate
 In the era of social media, we see many pictures every day and move forward, but some pictures are such that they do not allow them to move forward
 rajdhani se 65 kilometre dur uttar pradesh ke hapur jile kii ye ek aisi hi tasviir he
 In Hapur district, Mohammad Qasim and a 60-year old Samiuddin were killed by a mob in the name of stealing a cow
 aspataal pahunchane se pehle mohammad kasim kii maut ho gai jabaki samiuddin gambhir rup se jakhmi hai
 It has been described as a case of 'road rage' in the police FIR
 ab baat is dardanaak tasviir kii
 Mohammed Qasim is the blood-soaked man whom four people are carrying holding hands and feet and hanging
 police kii maujuudagi main ghayal mohammad kasim ko jis tareeke se le jaaya ja rahaa he wo hamaare system ke mar chuke hone kaa jeeta-jaagta saboot he
 If you look at this picture carefully, the mind starts to sit
 dimag gusse se bhanabhanane lagata he
 It seems that if there was a little life left in the system, he would have screamed with questions
 poochhate ki kya maanavadhikaar kaa naam suna he? kya ab ham is laayak bhi nahin bache hai ki aam maanviya vyavhaaron kaa paalan kar saken? kya ham kisi ghayal insaan ko aspataal aise pahunchaate hai? kya ham kisi mrit sharir ko shmashaan aise le jate hai?lekin ye sawaal puuchhen kisase? police se puch nahin sakate kyonki bina koi jaanch-padtaal kiye usne is maamle ko 'road rej' bataa diya
 She herself is an important character in this photo
 is dardanaak tasviir main sabase aage police ke hi log hai
 Humanity is being dragged behind them with hands and feet
 is police vaale ko tasviir kii takat kaa bhi andaja he or isiilie wo tasviir lene vaale ko roak bhi rahaa he
 It is the talk of big babus, leaders, they are currently busy doing yoga and doing fitness challenge
 unhen in sawaalon kii parvaah bhi nahin he shaayad
 If the picture reaches them, they will give a statement
 thodaa dukh jaahir kar denge
 It may also be that you say nothing, keep quiet
 aisi kisi tasviir ke aane par keval police ko doshi bataa dena, tehra dena sabase aasaan he
 It means to say that the police are guilty
 wo dikh bhi rahaa he
 But the real culprit is the system that considers the poor or weak as equal to the animal
 samajhataa he
 The fault of the system is also because it did not make the officials working on the land aware of human rights
 vaise ye pehali tasviir nahin he
 a picture similar to this came in 2010
 jisamen ek naksali ke shav ko surakshakarmi bans baandhakar le jate dikh rahe the
 Then perhaps such a picture came for the first time
 khub hallaa machaa tha
 The National Human Rights Commission issued a notice directly to the Ministry of Home Affairs
 lekin philhal jo tasviir hapur se ai he use lekar koi khaas ho-hallaa nahin much rahaa he
 Institutions working for human rights are also silent
 police vyavastha bhi shant he
 Yes, some people on social media are beating their chest with this, but whose real accountability they are currently busy in creating awareness of yoga in the world
 unki vyastata khatm ho to kuch sawaal-jawaab ho
 a person's bike was robbed through the online company OLX (OLX) with a great punchline of 'bech Dal' and the bike was also recovered through Facebook

 Hours later, they came to know of 3 fake ids

 Took in philhal jis aaropee ko pakadaa gaya he vah naaballig bataaya ja rahaa he or dilli ke ek skool main 11veen class main padhata he
 Her father is a government official in the Delhi Jal Board and hails from Qutub stronghold in outer Delhi along with the family
 filhal police usase poochtacha karke uske duusare saathi kaa pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Three days ago, on Friday, Anwar gave the advertisement to the OLX company to sell his sports bike
 duusare hi din use farrata angreji bolne vaale ek ladke kaa phone aayaa
 He expressed a desire to buy a bike
 bike kharidne vaale ladke ne anwar ko uttam nagar west metro stesan ke neeche bulaayaa
 When Anwar reached there with his bike, he found two smart boys and expressed a desire to check the motorcycle by driving
 iske baad ek shaks anwar ke saath khadaa ho gaya or doosraa bike par baith gaya
 Taking away something, he started calling Anwar, as soon as Anwar went a little further, the person standing with him ran away and the person riding the bike quickly took the bike and both of them lost the eye along with the bike as soon as Anwar was seen
 lekin, anwar ne bhi bike choron ko khojane ke liye soshal media kaa sahaara liya
 First filed a complaint with the police, then started checking the thieves' Facebook and Twitter accounts using their mobile numbers
 kuch hi ghante baad unhen 3 phek idi kaa pataa chal gaya
 The thieves had put pictures of the stolen bike on their Facebook by putting fake number plates
 bike ke peeche rana ji likh rakhaa tha or fasebuk profile par bike kii tasveeron ke alaava "chif officer at badmaash company" likhaa hua tha

 Congress not open account After 2008 delimitation, Semaria assembly seat was added in Rewa district
 is tarah se jile main 8 siten ho gai

 2008 main jile main bijepi ko 6 siton par jeet mili or 1 seat par basapa ko jeet mili
 While Uma Bharati's Bharatiya Janashakti Party won 1 seat
 haalanki baad main bhartiya janashakti party kaa vilay bijepi main ho gaya or bijepi kii siton kii sankhya 7 ho gai
 In Rewa, BJP, Congress, BSP as well as independents are also beating
 bijepi jahaan apana durg ko barkaraar rakhane ke jaddojahad kar rahi he
 At the same time, the Congress is trying to increase its seats, but the BSP remains the biggest obstacle in its path

 Salman Khan is going to do another film with Sooraj Barjatya
 is film kii script par kaam shuru bhi ho gaya he, haalanki is khabar ko ab tak dabaa kar rakhaa gaya, lekin sutara bataate hai ki salmaan ne khud hi suraj ko phone kiya or agali film kii taiyaari karne ko kaha
 The comments sutara yah bhi bataate hai ki salmaan ne sirf itani-si shart rakhi he ki is film kii shooting ke liye vah 2 se 3 maheene kaa samay denge
 Like 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo' cannot give 2 years time
 bataaya yah bhi ja rahaa he ki agar kahani or script puri ho gai to 'sultan' kii shooting puri hone ke baad salmaan suraj kii film par kaam shuru kar sakate hai
 Although the Suraj-directed previous release 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo' crossed the 200 crore mark, the film was not appreciated
 iske baavjood salmaan agar itani jaldi suraj ke saath duusari film karne kaa faisla darshata he ki vaaki salmaan or suraj ke bich dosti kaa gaharaa rishta he
 Sources also say that Salman has only kept such a condition that he will give 2 to 3 months time for the shooting of this film
 'prem ratan dhan payo' kii tarah 2 saal kaa samay nahin de sakate
 It is also being told that if the story and script is completed, Salman can start work on Sooraj's film after the shooting of 'sultan'
 haalanki suraj nirdeshit pichhali relies film 'prem ratan dhan payo' ne 200 karod kaa aankada paar kiya magar film ko saraahna nahin mili
 Despite this, if Salman decides to do another film with Sooraj so soon, it shows that there is indeed a deep bond of friendship between Salman and Sooraj

 india today ke agro summit and awords 2018 main krishi rajya mantri gajendra singh shekhavat, rashtriya lok dal (ralod) ke upaadhyaksh jayant choudhary, congress ke varisht netaa sanjay nirupam, kisaan netaa viem singh or krishi visheshgy devendra sharma ne bhaag liya
 Farming and farming politics were discussed by this panel
 is satr kaa sanchaalan india today hindi ke sampadak anshuman tiwari ne kiya
 You also read who said what
 
 
 krishi rajya mantri gajendra sinhashekhavat ne kisaanon kii pershani kaa zikr karte hue kaha, dedh lakh karod kii karj maafee, nunatam samarthan mulya (emspi) ke bare main charchaa or uske baad bhi kisaan pareshaan kyon he
 Debt waiver cannot completely solve the problem of India's farmer
 jab tak kisaan kii vaastavik samasya ko nahin samajha jayega tab tak is desh ke kisaan kaa bhala nahin ho saktaa
 The way the situation has changed since the country became independent
 gajendra singh ne kaha ki aaj se 30-40 saal pehle kisaanon ke paas upaj kii samasya thi
 Today the situation has changed
 aaj utpaadan badha he
 Actually, there was an emphasis on increasing production since independence, but it did not work towards consumption
 vartmaan samay main hamaara jitna utpaadan he use khapaane kii kshamta hamaare paas nahin he
 We have to work towards it
 aaj demand kam he or supplai zyada he
 Senior Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam said, i do not believe that there is no agriculture policy in our country
 main nahin maanata ki kisaanon ke liye kaam nahin hua he
 After independence, we did not have enough food to feed the people
 hamen baahar se ann mangate the
 Today the situation is different
 aaj hamaara utpaadan bahut badha he
 But along with this the crisis of life of farmers has also increased
 nirupap ne kaha ki maharashtra main pichley teen-chaar saalon main kisaanon kii atmahatyaayein badi hai
 i would basically suggest that we have to improve the lending situation
 hamaara dharm he or karm he ki ham kisaanon ke saath khadey rahen
 Another suggestion is that our farmers do not have availability of bajad today
 isapar bhi kaam karnaa hoga
 Debt waiver is not the final solution, but will have to be forgiven immediately
 jayant choudhary ne kaha, philhal bahumat kii sarkaar he
 There is a lot of hope from such a government
 main poochta hum kisaan kaa karj kyon nahin maaf hona chahie? thik he ki ye sthaayee upaay nahin he, malaham ke jaisaa he
 But there is also a need to apply ointments
 kya sirf korporate gharaanon ke karj maaf kiye jaaenge
 Jayant alleged that there was deception with the farmers that in many states it was said that the debt of the farmers was waived, but the farmers did not benefit from it
 jab kisaan kii paidaavar itani he ki ham supplai kar saken to aap baahar se manga rahe hai
 It was announced in UP that there will be purchase of potatoes, but you are buying 1 percent
 isse kya ho paaegaa
 Things are not practical
 kisaan netaa viem singh ne kaha, sarkaar kisaanon ke saath khadi nahin hoti, sarkaar kii majaburi hoti he
 The farmer learns farming from his mother's belly
 ham chaahate hai ki jo hamane paidaavar kiya he hamen uskaa mulya chahie
 As far as the matter is concerned, nothing will happen by waiving the loan
 aisa nahin he
 Agriculture expert Devendra Sharma said, "the crisis in farming today is part of a well thought out strategy
" arthvyavastha ko dizin he usase kisase kisaan ko maranaa hi maranaa he
 Where does the farmer's income come from? agar emspi ko dekh len to 45 saal main kisaanon kii inakam sirf 19 guna badi he
 According to Devendra Sharma, if the government employees had increased by 19 times, how many suicides would have taken place
 kheti main dikkat ye nahin he ki aapako kheti kerani aati nahin he
 You are deliberately kept poor
 or ye duniya main ho rahaa he
 The US and Europe provide subsidies
 meraa maananaa he ki kisaan ko ek sunishchit aay mili
 State Bank of India has 0 in PLR
 75 fisadi katautee karne kii ghoshnaa kii he
 This deduction will be applicable from December 1
 iske lagu hone se home lone, car lone sahit anya lone ke byaaj daron main katautee sambhav hoga
 Earlier, IDBI and PNB announced a cut in their interest rates
 idibiai ne byaaj daron main 0
 There was a 5 per cent cut
 vaishvik mandi ke asar ko kam karne ke liye bhartiya rigerv bank siaraar or repo rate main pehle kii kami kar chukaa he
 After meeting with the finance minister and the finance secretary, government and private banks agreed to cut interest rates
 dhokhaa dena pakistan kii puraani aadat he or ek baar phir pakistan ne aisa hi kiya he
 From Sunday morning, there was continuous firing on the border from the Pakistani Army
 pakistan kii is napak golibari main bharat ke chaar jawan shahid hue hai, inamen ek captain bhi shaamil hai
 In Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan opened its nefarious weaponry in the Bhimbar Gali sector and the jawans of India were martyred from the ammunition from the neighboring country
 hamale kii puri kahani
 
 
 Pakistan in the Bhimbar Gali sector of Rajouri district, about 3 pm
 30 baje sijafire ko baari golibari se todaa
 Apart from Bhimber Gali, Pakistan also fired mortars in Manjakot sector of Rajouri
 pakistan ne seemaa ghaat lagaataar elosi par hamalaa kiya or anti gided misile daagni shuru kar di
 Army Captain Kapil Kundu, Havildar Roshal Lal, Rifleman Shubham Singh and Rifleman Ram Avatar were martyred in the shelling triggered by deception
 inke alaava sena ke 2 jawan ghayal bhi hue hai jinaki haalat najuk bataai ja rahi he
 Let me tell you that the brave Captain Kapil Kundu of the Army was only 23 years old, who had a birthday on 10 February
 elosi par pakistan kii baukhalaahat ravivaar subah se hi dikhaai de rahi thi
 First, heavy firing was carried out at the Indian Army post at Shahpur in Poonch district, bordering the Line of Control
 shahpur main based gaanvvaalon ko bhi nahin pataa ki koun si goli or koun sa gola unke sharir ko chalni kar de
 Constantly being martyred, Jawanpakistan violated ceasefire more than 860 times in 2017, while in 2018 itself it has broken ceasefire more than 160 times
 aapako bataa den ki 2014 main 51 jawan shahid ho gaye jabaki 110 aatankiyon ko maar giraaya gaya
 In 2015, 41 soldiers were martyred and 113 terrorists were killed
 2016 main surakshabalon ne apane 88 jawan gavaan die lekin 165 aatankiyon kaa khel bhi tamaam hua
 In the year 2017, 83 soldiers attained martyrdom while 218 terrorists were killed in Operation Allout
 2018 main 4 farvari tak sena ke captain samet 8 jawan shahid ho chuke hai lekin saath hi 10 aatankiyon ko maut kii neend sulaai ja chuki he
 How long has Pakistan lost its 4 brave soldiers in Pakistan's latest ceasefire violation? haalanki hameshaa kii tarah bhartiya sena ne bhi karaara jawaab dete hue paak fouj kii kai chaukiyon ko barbaad kiya lekin sawaal he ki aakhir kabatak hamaare jawan pakistan kii goli khaakar shahid hote rahenge
 
 
 After all, we will keep writing only here and show that India retaliated and gave a befitting reply to Pakistan
 ji haa, sarhad par pakistan puri tarah se belgaum ho chukaa he or ab vakt aa chukaa he jab hindustan ko aisa jawaab dena hoga ki pashchim kaa bahaka baukhalaayaa padosi hameshaa ke liye apni napak harkaton kaa tyaag kar de
 Pakistan is constantly showing its cowardice and is targeting Indian jawans every now and then
 aapako bataa den ki is saal is sector main hue sangharshaviram ulanghan main ab tak nau javaanon samet 17 logon kii maut hui he or 70 log ghayal ho chuke hai

 HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh recalls how the Mistry family bought shares of the Tata group for the first time
 unhone bataaya, ''palonji ke pita tata motors or tata steel ke liye plant kaa construction karte the
 The Tata group did not have the money to pay them, so instead they gave them shares
 '' palonji dhire-dhire apane parivaar kii share holding badhaate gaye
 He also bought shares of members of the Tata family who wanted to go out of business
 vaise, unke kareebi logon kaa kahana he ki palonji shapurji mistre ekantavasi nahin hai
 Popular architect Hafeez Contractor, who has been associated with Palonji since 1968, says, "for me they are very accessible
 main un tak kabhi bhi pahunch saktaa hum, phone par yaa unke ghar yaa offis jaakar
 They always welcome me warmly
 ve shandaar aadmi hai
 His mood is to befriend and help another
 '' haalanki, contractor kuch hi bhaagyashaalee logon main se hai jinaki shapurji tak sidhi pahunch he

 is tarah kii agm unke durlabh saarvajanik kaaryakramon main shaamil hai
 Ashalata Maheshwari, an investor holding shares of about 1,000 companies, including ACC and Tata group firms, says, "I have spoken to him in ACC meetings, but this was a long time ago
" ''palonji har cheez ko vistaar se jaananaa chaahate hai or ve multah parfectionist hai
 They strive for perfection even if the expenditure for it exceeds the budget
 samooh ke liye philhal aath project par kaam karne vaale hafeez contractor kehete hai ki palonji kaa ek saamaanya-sa darshan he, ''hamen yah sunishchit karnaa chahie ki kaam sarvottam ho kyonki ham donon kaa naam isse judaa he
 This was his standard statement before starting any of our projects
 ''hafeez contractor ne espiji ke saath kai project par kaam kiya haih bangaloru main bacchon ke liye boarding skool-sarala birla academy, nagpur main 'ampress city' naam kaa ek township project or mumbai main bharat kii sabase oonchi imperial towers
 The SPG has built many of India's most famous buildings - Taj Mahal Palace & Towers and The Oberoi Hotel (both of which had a terrorist attack in 2008), mumbai-pune Expressway, Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai, World Trade Center, Sultan of Oman in West Asia
 The Palace and the President's Palace in Ghana in Africa
 ab aisa lagata he ki is samooh main satta badal rahi he
 Ever since the resignation of some of the companies from the board of Pallonji earlier this year, there has been a lot of buzz that now a new arrangement is being made in the group

 shapur kii gupachup niyukti usee tarj par kii gai jis tarah se november, 2011 main sirus ko ratan tata kaa uttaradhikari banaaya gaya
 It was only after the Tata Group issued a formal statement that the media became aware of it
 apni 83 arab dollar (4,56,500 karod ru
 ), Which acquired nearly two-thirds of its revenue from overseas operations, had selected Cyrus after a talent hunt globally to succeed Ratan Tata
 aakhir yah pratibha khoj ghar main hi aakar puri hui

 espiji or tata samooh ke bich hue ek samajhaite ke mutabik, tata samooh ke bhavi chairman kii share holding ko ek trust main daal diya gaya he
 However, not everyone was convinced by Cyrus' progress
 ashalatha maheshwari kahati hai, ''jab logon ne yah bataaya ki sirus ek bachche jaise hai, to mujhe bhi dar laga ki ve itane bade samrajya ko chalaa bhi paaenge? lekin jab mistar tata (ratan tata) ne pad sambhala tha to unako bhi zyada anubhav nahin tha
 The 75-year-old shareholder had earlier said that she would not go to an AGM after Ratan Tata retired
 lekin ab unhone apana man badal liya he
 She says, "this family (mistry) is not just about money
 ve kaaphi saral hai
 Cyrus is young and intelligent and i think Tata sahab has taken the right decision
 main agm main jaati rahuungi
 "there is a difference in the way Pallonji and his elder son Shapoor work," says a businessman associated with the elder son's group
 ve bataate hai, ''palonji kii niti yah he ki har samasya kaa samaadhaan tatkaal kiya jaae or use zyada gambhir hone se roka jaae
 Any contract that is taken by the group is implemented as an individual and because of this the group maintains a separate identity
 '' magar shapur alag tarah se sochate hai
 a person inside the company said that they are 'strategists' and Shapoor has now started redesigning the group to play a global role

 After coming far ahead from Hyderabad airport, after seeing several life-size idols together in a shop, it seemed that all the great men have not returned
 maine bhi apni car waapas le lee or vibhinn mudraon main khadi in murtiyon ke kareeb chalaa gaya
 Reading the expressions of these life-size idols standing in silence with their own thoughts was no less than going through a book
 yah sochakar romanchit ho gaya ki agar vaaki kisi din ye sabhi mahapurush laut aaen or ek saath mujhe hi mil jaaen to main kya-kya puch saktaa hum
 Whom to talk to first

 There are four or five idols sold in the month, but there is a lot of sale around 14 April
 baaki netaaon kii murtiyon kaa kya haal he? venkat ne kaha ki baaki sari murtiyon maheene main kul milakar do-chaar hi bik paati hai

 apane kaaryon se ye sabhi bade to hai hi, oonchai ke kaaran bhi main in sabase chota pad gaya
 Shopkeeper Venkat Swamy said that most of the statues are seven feet, but only the tall statue of Dr
 Ambedkar is sold
 vijaywada kii ek factory main fibre se ye murtiyon banakar yahaan aati hai or phir rangai-putai ke baad ham inhen bikne laayak bana dete hai
 Who sells the most idol? It did not take Vacant a second to answer my question
 kaha, doctor ambedkar kii
 There are four or five idols sold in the month, but there is a lot of sale around 14 April
 baaki netaaon kii murtiyon kaa kya haal he? venkat ne kaha ki baaki sari murtiyon maheene main kul milakar do-chaar hi bik paati hai
 In these, the demand of Rajiv Gandhi and sometimes Vivekananda comes, but the demand of Dr
 Ambedkar is always there
 uttar bharat main nile kot vaale ambedkar hi milte hai, lekin venkat kii dukaan par ambedkar nile rang ke alaava safed kot ke bheetar golden shart bhi pahane hue hai to unki ek murti to sir se lekar paanv tak golden color main hi rangi hui thi
 The seven-foot statue made of fiber costs seventy thousand rupees

 Hearing Venkata Swamy's words, i started to feel the idols standing there

 Ambedkar, Mother Teresa, Rajiv Gandhi, Indira Gandhi all together

 badal ne kaha ki punjab kaa apni rajdhani par ekmaatr adhikaar he or ise punjab ko har keemat par diya janaa aavashyak he
 The comments unhone kaha ki jab tak chandigarh ko is rajya ko nahin diya jaataa he, tab tak punjab ke rajyapal ko chandigarh kaa prashaasak niyukt karne kii chaar dashak puraani vyavastha ko barkaraar rakhaa janaa chahie

 (inputs bhashaa se bhi) If anyone other than Ashwin has impressed with his bowling in the first and second Test match against Sri Lanka, it is Amit Mishra
 amit ko captain viraat kohli kaa puraa samarthan hasil he
 As much as Harbhajan Singh
 balki harbhajan ko zyada vishwaas hasil he
 But Bhajji could not change this confidence in the result
 jabaki mishra ne pehle test main 5 wicket liye or duusare test kii pehali pari main sabase zyada chaar wicket hasil kiye, jabaki duusari pari main unhen teen wicket mili
 The comments duusari pari main unhone dinesh chandimal jaise ballebaaj ko bold kiya
 This wicket is important because it was Chandimal, who snatched the match from India, scoring an unbeaten 165 in the first match
 aswin ke jodidar kii talash lambey samay se chal rahi thi
 Former Test captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni had more faith in Ravindra Jadeja than himself, he gave more opportunities to Jadeja than needed, but Jadeja could not support Ashwin
 kam se kam test maichon main to bilkul nahin
 Not even on the helpful tracks of India and spin
 dhoni ke jate hi team chayan main kohli kaa asar dikhaa
 Amit Mishra continued to play well in pieces, but he was dismissed in a stick due to the lack of confidence of captain Dhoni
 viraat ke captain banate hi amit na keval sidhe team main aae bilki maidan main bhi utaare gaye
 Now that the 4 Test matches are to be held in India from October, Amit will play the main role in the Indian attack with Ashwin
 aise main ab dawaab harbhajan par hoga kyonki unki jagah pakki nahin he
 Amit has the full support of captain Virat Kohli
 utana hi jitna harbhajan singh ko
 Rather, Harbhajan has more faith
 lekin bhajji is bharose ko parinaam main nahin badal paae
 While Mishra took 5 wickets in the first test and took the maximum four wickets in the first innings of the second test, he got three wickets in the second innings
 tippaniyan In the second innings, he bowled a batsman like Dinesh Chandimal
 yah wicket isliye ahm he, kyonki chandimal hi the, jinhone pehle match main behtareen 165 ran naabad banaakar bharat se match chin liya tha
 The search for Ashwin's partner was going on for a long time
 purv test captain mahendrasingh dhoni ko ravindra jadeja par khud se zyada bharosa tha, unhone jadeja ko jarurat se zyada maukey die, lekin jadeja aswin kaa saath nahin de paae
 At least not in Test matches at all
 bharat or spin ke madadgaar treks par bhi nahin
 Kohli showed an impact in team selection as soon as Dhoni left
 amit mishra tukade-tukade main acha khelte rahe, lekin captain dhoni kaa vishwaas hasil nahin hone ke kaaran vah ek chhatke main baahar kar die jate the
 After becoming Virat's captain, Amit not only came directly into the team but was also fielded
 ab jabaki oktober se 4 test match bharat main hi hone hai amit bhartiya akramak main mukhya bhoomika nibhaayenge aswin ke saath
 In such a situation, now the pressure will be on Harbhajan because his place is not confirmed
 duusari pari main unhone dinesh chandimal jaise ballebaaj ko bold kiya
 This wicket is important because it was Chandimal, who snatched the match from India, scoring an unbeaten 165 in the first match
 aswin ke jodidar kii talash lambey samay se chal rahi thi
 Former Test captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni had more faith in Ravindra Jadeja than himself, he gave more opportunities to Jadeja than needed, but Jadeja could not support Ashwin
 kam se kam test maichon main to bilkul nahin
 Not even on the helpful tracks of India and spin
 dhoni ke jate hi team chayan main kohli kaa asar dikhaa
 Amit Mishra continued to play well in pieces, but he was dismissed in a stick due to the lack of confidence of captain Dhoni
 viraat ke captain banate hi amit na keval sidhe team main aae bilki maidan main bhi utaare gaye
 Now that the 4 Test matches are to be held in India from October, Amit will play the main role in the Indian attack with Ashwin
 aise main ab dawaab harbhajan par hoga kyonki unki jagah pakki nahin he
 Kohli showed an impact in team selection as soon as Dhoni left
 amit mishra tukade-tukade main acha khelte rahe, lekin captain dhoni kaa vishwaas hasil nahin hone ke kaaran vah ek chhatke main baahar kar die jate the
 After becoming Virat's captain, Amit not only came directly into the team but was also fielded

 This ship carries a large amount of relief material

 bharat sarkaar chaahati he ki is mukademe ko ek civil mukademe kii shakl di jaae na ki criminal, jaisaa ki america ne kiya he
 Having a civil case will make it a case of low wage payment

 This would cut America's nose as it gave maid Sangeeta Richard citizenship there, and quietly invited her family members to America
 sarkaar ke liye yah mahatvapurn nahin he ki devayani ko baad main america jane kii anumati mili yaa nahin
 It is important for him to have diplomatic accreditation
 isse use mukademe se chhutkaaraa mil jayega
 After this, the Government of India can bring it here anytime

 After the announcement of demonetisation in November 2016, the Modi government had emphasized on cashless transactions in the country
 ab 1 july se deshbhar main jiesti lagu kar sarkaar ne ek baar phir cashles tranjaction kii disha main badhate desh ke liye tex dhaanche main bada pherbadal kar diya he
 This time the government's decision will make it expensive for banks in the country to provide ATM facility because after 1 July it has become expensive for the bank to buy ATM machine
 sarkaar ne atm mashin par sarvaadhik 28 fisadi tex lagaaya he
 In addition, maintenance of ATM machines has become more expensive
 farvari 2017 main notebandi ke baad apana ahm kendriya bajet pesh karte hue vitt mantri arun jetali ne elaan kiya tha, "desh main cashles tranjaction ko badhaava dene ke liye pioes mashin(point of cell mashin) par basic custom duty, exise duty, counterveling duty samet anya duty ko maaf kar diya gaya he(shunya fisadi)
 "this decision of the government made the purchase of POS machines very cheap for banks in the country and made it easy for them to issue POS machines to the traders all over the country
 1 july se yah pioes mashin ek baar phir jiesti ke daayre main laa di gai he
 According to the GST framework, POS machines will now be taxed at the rate of 18 per cent
 lihaaja, jiesti lagu hone ke baad ab bainkon ke liye deshbhar main cashles tranjaction ko badhaava dene ke liye pioes mashiinon kaa vistaar karnaa mahangaa ho gaya he
 Significantly, after the demonetisation came into force in November 2016, there was a big increase in cashless transactions for a few months
 lekin jaise-jaise rigerv bank bazaar main nai karency kaa sanchaar badhaati gai, logon main cash ke prati rujhaan main bhi ijapha hone laga or cashles tranjaction ke aankade ek baar phir girane lage hai
 Hence, the new tax structure is expected to have a negative effect on ATM and POS machines in GST
 lekin sawaal yah he ki kya kendra sarkaar ne jis notebandi ke baad desh main cashles lenden ko badhaava dene kii koshish kii use ab vah jiesti se palatney kii taiyaari main he
 Obviously, the increased price of ATM and POS machines is not good news for small and new banks as well as new means of digital payment after demonetisation
 is nai dar ke baad bank ek taraf digital madhyamon ko badhaava dene vaali pioes mashine kaa vistaar karne se kataraaengi vahiin duusari taraf cash sanchaar ko durust rakhane ke liye atm network bhi bainkon ke liye pareshaani ban jaaenge
 Therefore, while the central government tried to increase cashless transactions in the country by implementing demonetisation, now the path of cash withdrawal from GST has been cleared once again

 america pratibandh ke saae main bharat or rus es-400 dephence missile system deal par sahmati karne ke liye taiyaar he
 The US may impose a Katsa ban (counting American Advertisers Through sanctions-caatsa) on this five billion dollar mega defense deal
 pichley maheene america ne china par yahi bain lagaaya tha
 Then China bought fighter aircraft and missile defense system from Russia
 gauratlab he ki katsa pratibandh kaa istemaal america ne un deshon par dabaav banane ke liye kiya he jo rus se ke saath ahm raksha sauda karata he
 Significantly, India has decided to do this deal with Russia, bypassing the fears of the US embargo due to its defense needs
 bharat ko ummid he ki uski raksha zaruraton ko samajhate hue es-400 deal par america katsa pratibandh nahin lagayegaa
 President Donald Trump approved the Katsa law in August keeping in mind Russia's modern defense missile system
 america ne rus ko antarrashtriya str par america ke hiton ke khilaaf kaam karne se rokane ke liye yah kanoon taiyaar kiya he
 Significantly, this law of America has been made in view of the activities of Russia
 inamen 2014 main rus kii ore se ukraine par hamalaa kar kreemia par kabja karne, syria grih yuddh main shariq hone or 2016 ke america raashtrapati ke chunaav main dakhal dena shaamil he
 Like Russia and America, China will also fail in the 'afghanistan Plan'? In September, a ban was imposed against China under this law
 vahiin, america prashasan ne bharat or rus ke bich hone vaale is dephence deal par kaha he ki uski apane sabhi mitra or sahyogi deshon se apil he ki vah rus ke saath dephence deal na karen nahin uske paas katsa kanoon kaa istemaal karne ke alaava koi vikalp nahin hoga
 The US administration claims that the Katsa ban can be imposed on the S-400 defense deal because section 231 of this law provides for a ban on defense deals where military capability is likely to increase
 trade war: tisare vishwa yuddh ke liye taiyaar china kar saktaa he america par ye hamalaa bhibharat sarkaar kaa daawa he ki use dakshin asia main apni sthiti ko surakshit karne ke liye is missile kii zarurat he
 Defense experts have claimed that while India will try to control China through this missile, it will give India an edge over Pakistan's current capability
 bataa den ki dakshin asia main pakistan ke paas maujuuda samay main kisi ladaaku vimaan ko trek karne ke saath-saath use maar giraane kii kuwvat he
 At the same time, Pakistan can also kill stealth fighter jets (stealth fighter jets)
 supreme court ne jammu-kashmir main sarkaar ko bhang kar rajyapal shashan lagane kii maang khaarij kar di he

 Hearing the petition of the Jammu and Kashmir National Panther Party, the court has given these instructions to the Center

 The petition was filed in the Panther Party court last week, demanding that the current situation in Kashmir is very bad
 isko dekhte hue supreme court rajyapal ko ye nirdesh de ki vojammu-kashmirasamvidhan ke anuchhed 92 ke tahat rajya main sarkaar ko bhang kar shashan apane haath main le len
 So as to ensure the safety, protection and fundamental rights of the people of the state

 ‚Äô The wife and mother of Kulbhushan Jadhav, a former Indian Navy officer jailed in Pakistan, met Jadhav in Islamabad on Monday, but Pakistan is believed to be working to improve its image through this meeting
 kulbhushan jadhav ko jasusi ke maamle kaa doshi bataate hue april maheene main pakistan kii sainya court ne unhen faansee kii sajaa sunai thi
 Whereas India claims that Jadhav started his business in Iran after retiring from the Navy and from there the Taliban kidnapped him and handed him over to Pakistan Intelligence Agency
 vahiin duusari taraf pakistan bharat ke is sawaal kaa jawaab dene main bhi naakaam rahaa ki jab jadhav ko iran main giraftaar kiya gaya tha to wo pakistan kaise pahunche?iske saath hi pakistan ne bharat ko consular acces nahin diya to phir jadhav ko unki maa or patni ko milane kii ijaajat ke bare main pakistan ne kyon kaha ki ye ijaajat maanviya aadhaar par di gai?is mulaakaat parapakistanka jo ravaiya dikh rahaa he us par bhartiya raksha sutron ke mutabik aisa karke pakistani sena yah dikhaanaa chaahati he ki vah bharat ke saath kisi bhi masale ko handle karne main sakasham he
 The hidden agenda of the Pakistani Army is also being understood behind this meeting
 darasal, pakistan main sena or sarkaar ke bich hameshaa se varchasv ko lekar takaraav dekha gaya he
 The army has been challenging the democratic government of the country on every occasion
 sarkaron ke str par donon deshon main shanti bahaali kii koshishon ko palitha lagane ke aarope bhi pakistani sena par lagate rahe hai
 In such a situation, this exercise of reuniting Jadhav with his family is also seen as that the Pakistani Army keeps itself proud to deal with issues related to India
 saath hi pakistan yah bhi dikhaanaa chahta tha ki jadhav jinda he
 According to sources, Pakistan is also trying to soften the relationship between the two countries by using Jadhav
 yahi vajah he ki pakistan main jadhav ke khilaaf maahaul hone ke bajwajood ye kadam uthaaya gaya
 Behind this softness on Jadhav, it is also believed that there will be some flexibility in the relationship between the two countries
 pakistan ke is kadam ke bharat ke saath baatcheet ke rishte ko behaal karne kii koshish ke rup main bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 However, despite all this, there is no possibility of any change in India's policy and decision against Pakistan
 bharat antarrashtriya str par bhi pakistan ko alag-thalag karne kii koshish karata rahaa he or pehle hi pakistan ke saath dwipaksheeya vaarta se bhi inkaar kar chukaa he
 On one hand, Pakistan had given a visa on humanitarian grounds to visit Jadhav's wife and mother
 vahiin duusari taraf wo elosi par sijafire kaa ulanghan kar pakistan kaa napak cheharaa dikhaata he
 On 23 December, Pakistan Army again opened fire on the Line of Control (loc) adjacent to the Kerry area of jammu-kashmir Rajori, breaking the ceasefire

 The week when we complete the 69th year of our constitution on 26 January, we will enter an important milestone, and will read the text of equality, justice, freedom and fraternity contained in its preamble, but can we really say that all four What is the fate of our country on the scale? The country is watching what is happening on the rest of the scales, but the Oxfam report is a drastic slap in our country on the basis of economic equality in the establishment of an equity oriented society, which shows that more than half of the wealth of this country is nine people
 Sacrifice
 aise main ham ganatantr kaa gungan jarur kar sakate hai, lekin 2 saal 11 maheene or 18 din main 166 baithkon ke baad bani samvidhan naam kii kitaab kii mul bhaavana ke saath jo kuch bhi ho rahaa he, use desh kaise sweekaar kar saktaa he ? amiri‚Äîgaribi kii khai ko keval is tark se to nahin sweekaar kiya ja saktaa ki yah khai to hameshaa se hi rahi he, niti‚Äîniyantaaon ko yah dekhnaa hoga ki yah khai lagaataar badhati ja rahi he
 Will we think this on Constitution Day? This is the crisis of the world, not of the country
 beete teen‚Äîchaar saalon main jo report ai hai vah lagaataar is baat kii ore ishaara kar rahi hai ki duniya kii aarthik sampada or kendrikrut hokar kam se kam haathon main jaati ja rahi he
 In 2016, the 57 people who had a wealth of 3 crore 80 billion in the world, it was reduced to 44 people in the next year and then this year it has reduced to less than that of only 26 people
 bharat main das pratishat logon ke paas desh kii sampada kaa takreeban 77 pratishat hissaa he
 Further data is that in India alone more than half of the total wealth is in hands and only sixty percent people have only 4
 8 pratishat daulat he, rupayon main yah sankhya koi chalis karod baithti he
 Along with this, one more thing is that in the last year 18 new Dhankubers i
e
 billionaires have been born in India, now the number of these Dhankubers has increased to 119
 vaah, kaise samtamulak samaaj banane kii ore bad rahaa he hamaara bharat or kisi vicitra baat he ki duniya daulat kii taraf daud rahi he or daulat ek vyakti kii tijori main samaa jane ko lalayit hui ja rahi he, yah to daulat kaa nyaay nahin he, yah prakruti kaa nyaay bhi nahi he, yah samvidhan kii bhaavana kaa nyaay bhi nahin he
 This injustice is deep in India
 garibi kii rekha laachaaron kaa har saal katl karti he, kahin bhukh se, beemaari se, kuposhan se or ham itaraa sakate hai ki aarthik paimaanon par ham apni jidipi badhaakar khub tarakkee kar rahe hai
 The question is that if this is a growth and indeed the country is rich, then who will take out seventy percent of the country's population from this Kalankini poverty line list
 isiilie jab samvidhan main nyaay kii baat hogi to vah keval kanoonee nyaay kii nahin ho sakati, us nyaay ke daayre ko vyapak rup se us sandarbh main bhi dekhnaa hoga jo is garibi ke anyaay ko bhi niyati kaa khel na maanate hue nitiyon kii asafalataa ko maanegaa or use durust bhi karegaa
 Therefore, this is also the time to review the values that were established in this seventy years of the Constitution
