 gujarat main patan jile ke jhilwara gaanv ke paas hue ek sadak haadase main paanch bacchon or aath mahilaon sahit 18 shraddhaluon kii maut ho gayi jabaki 15 anya jakhmi ho gaye
 Police said on Wednesday that a painful accident occurred due to a face-to-face collision between an open loading van and a state transport bus
 adhikariyon ne kaha ki haadase main maare gaye zyaadaatar log mehsana jile ke jhilsaan gaanv se taalluk rakhte hai
 He was returning from a dargah of Radhanpur after performing Jiyarat
 unhone bataaya ki yah vaardaat sami-jhilwara road par us vakt hui jab vine main gujarat rajya sadak parivahan nigam kii ek bas ne saamne se takkar maar di
 The accident killed 18 people, including eight women and five children
 jakhmi hue logon ko sami taluka ke ek aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 He was five and he was alone
 paanchon ne use gher rakhaa tha
 The intention of the five was also the same
 kisi bhi keemat par use maar daalana
 He also succeeded in his intention
 unamem se ek ne use goli maar di
 However, when all this was happening, more people were present there
 magar sabane apni ankhen moond rakhi thim
 It felt like nobody was watching anything
 magar ek chashmadid tha jisane apni ankhen nahin mundi thim
 He was watching everything
 par wo bhi sirf dekh rahaa tha
 Because he could not do anything
 magar uskaa bas dekhnaa bhar bhi aakhir main kanoon ke liye kargar sabit ho gadha
 He tried to escape before the petrol pump owner was shot dead
 magar jab puraa kaa puraa kareeb aadha darjan log ek insaan kii jaan ke peeche paden ho to kismat bhi use kaise bachaae
 The story began in a room built in the extent of a petrol pump and ended in the same
 raat ke vaqt petrol pump main gine-chune karmchaaree the
 But six cameras were recording each and every section of the petrol pump
 begusarai ke hardiya ilaake main surya sivam petrol pump ke is daftar main pump kaa munshi umesh din bhar ke hisaab kitaab main mashgool tha
 Because in a short time the owner of the pump Lakshmi Narayan Singh alias Chhotu ji was going to come
 magar is din umesh kii bechaini kuch zyaada hi jhalak rahi thi
 Umesh had never seen such a thing in the last 18 years
 jaisaa aaj dikh rahaa tha
 He was going out sometime
 kabhi andar aa rahaa tha
 Munshi's role is suspicious, even Lakshmi Narayan Singh enters the room and starts checking the book throughout the day
 umesh vahiin khadaa rahata he
 The phone arrives and Lakshmi Narayan Singh engages in talking
 thodi hi der main umesh kamare se baahar nikal jaataa he or kamare se uske nikalne ke thik paanch minute baad hi ek shaks kamare ke andar daakhil hota he
 It was someone who tied a cloth on his head, which the owner Lakshmi Narayan Singh did not know at all
 kamare main daakhil hote hi ye shaks lakshmi narayan singh kii canapati par pistaul taan detaa he
 But instead of being afraid, Lakshmi Narayan Singh faces the person with full determination
 ek baar ko to wo bina dare use dhakelte hue kamare se hi baahar nikaal dete hai
 The miscreant shot in the chest, seeing this worsening case, this person shoots in his chest
 lakshmi narayan singh kii tii-shart khun se laal ho jaati he, magar unhone haar nahin maani or waapas kamare main ghuskar counter se paise nikaal rahehamlavar kaa saamnakarne lagate hai
 He even slams her on the ground
 magar is khinchataan main unka kaaphi khun bah chukaa tha or wo isi haalat main aundhe munh zamin par gir padate hai
 In just 30 seconds, Lakshmi Narayan Singh was rubbing heels on the ground and the killer had escaped by committing blood
 tadap-tadapakar petrol pump ke maalik ne dam tod diya
 But no employee of his pump came to save him, but an employee comes to the doorpost and takes a picture of Lakshmi Narayan Singh in the same condition
 karmchaaree madad ke bajaay khinch rahe the photois baat kii hairaani hone ke bajaae ki badmaash bade bekhauf hokar petrol pump main maalik kii hatya kar ke chale gaye
 Employees were engaged in taking photographs of the owner's body upside down
 lekin ye to sirf ek camere kii tasviren thim jisane is sansanikhez vaardaat ko ricard kiya
 The rest of the cameras on the pump were also recording the antics of the killers and their accomplices
 pump main lage alag-alag camere apane-apane angel se hatya ke vaqt baahar kii harkaton ko record kar rahe the
 Munshi Umesh goes to the bathroom before leaving the office built in the pump before the murder, but neither he lights the bathroom light nor closes his door
 tabhi do apradhi motor cycle par savaar hokar pump par pahunchate hai
 Just 30 seconds later, the shooter also appears in this camera
 badmaash ne kiya tha isharaao in badmaashon kii taraf dekhtaa he or motorcycle par peeche baithe badmaash use haath uthaakar ishaara karte hai
 At the same time, when the killer was killing Laxmi Narayan Singh inside the office, at the same time, his employee was seen fixing a banner in a strange way
 bakaul police isi ne hatya ke baad lakshmi narayan singh kii tasviir lee thi
 In this entire incident, the actions of the employees of the pump were shocking
 petrol pump ke maalik kii hatya ho jaati he magar aropiyon ko pakadaney yaa maalik ko bachaane ke bajaae photo khinchate nazar aa rahe the
 The beleaguered miscreants go and kill the owner of a petrol pump on the roadside, and his own employees are recorded on CCTV cameras taking pictures of him after his death, rather than saving him
 kya ye thi sochi-samajhi sajeesh?saafe he is maamle main kuch to aisa he jisapar pardaa he
 Otherwise, how is it possible that the goons can carry out such a big crime so easily and no one can stop them
 begusarai ke hardiya ilaake main surya sivam petrol pump par jis tarah pump ke maalik lakshmi narayan singh kii hatya kii gai wo kai sawaal khadey kar rahaa he
 The family members of Lakshmi Narayan Singh alias Chhotu Bhaiyya say that this murder incident is a well-planned conspiracy
 kyonki jis tarah bekhauf hokar hatyare pump main daakhil hue or jis tarah maukey par maujuud pump ke karmchaariyon kii harakatein camere main darj huin, wo unhen shaq ke daayre main laati hai
 In the record of the camera that night, five robbers came riding on two bikes at the time of the murder
 saat logon ko kiya giraftaaris maamle main police ne saat logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 But it is being told that the main accused is still absconding
 gharavaale ise lut kaa maamla maanane se inkaar kar rahe hai
 However, apart from arresting the accused in this case, the police have recovered the weapons and motor cycle used in the crime
 police pakade gaye aropiyon se poochtacha bhi kar rahi he
 However, on the plea of the police, the family members are not sure
 parivaar ko shaq he ki police mukhya aropiyon ko chhodkar sirf un logon ko hi giraftaar kar maamle ko khatm kar dena chaahati he
 Who were visible in the camera
 police ne jis aaropee raja ko pakadaa he, wo pehle bhi aisi kai ghatnaon main shaamil rahaa he
 Many such incidents have taken place at petrol pumps only in Begusarai district
 CCTV main kaid hui puri vaardatpulice bhale is maamle ko lut ke angel se dekh rahi ho magar sisitivi main jo tasviren darj huin he, uske mutabik hatya karne waalon kii paisa uthaane main utani dilchaspee nahin dikhaai de rahi thi
 Besides the accused, the police had detained the pump employees Bombam and Umesh
 magar poochtacha ke baad unhen chhod diya
 His role in CCTV photographs seems quite suspicious
 badmaashon kii goli kaa shikaar hue petrol pump maalik lakshmi narayan apane bhaaiyon main tisare the, jinaki maut ho chuki he
 Earlier, two of his brothers were killed in the accident, one of whom died after falling from a train
 begusarai main lagaataar apradhi bekhauf hokar vaardaaton ko anjaam de rahe hai
 Incidents like robbery and murder are now becoming common here
 agar aapane abhi-abhi apane rishte kii shuruyaat kii he to aapke chehre par halki-halki muskaan to hameshaa chai rahegi lekin saath hi kuch aisi chintaaen bhi hongi jo hameshaa aapako ghere rahengi
 For example, you will be afraid of whether your relationship will work properly or not
 agar aap bhi jaananaa chaahate hai ki aapkaa life partner aapke liye sahi he yaa nahin to unhen parakhane ke ham kuch tareeke bataa rahe hai:1
 Do something against him: There are some men who want to keep their girlfriends in control
 aise main agar aap unki ichha ke khilaaf kuch karti hai wo bahutgussemen aa jate hai
 You might not want to spend your entire life with such an angry man
 lekin yadi unhen thodaa gusse aane ke baad yah samaj aa jaataa he ki aapaki khushi se badhkar unke liye kuch nahin he to wo ladkaa aapke liye parfect he
 These 5 secrets are known only to the best friend
 
 
 2
 Try arguing: Someday start arguing over anything
 phir dekhen ki wo usapar kaise riect kar rahaa he
 If he is explaining his idea in peace then human being is right for you but if he wants to change your mind then think once before spending life with such a man
 single hon yaa mingal garba aapke jivan main aise bharegaa rang
 
 
 3
 uske dhairya kii pariksha len:rishte main kisi ek partner kaa dhairyavan hona bahut jaruri he
 If both get angry soon then it is not good for the relationship
 aap unki pariksha ke liye wo kitni jaldi gusse main aa jaataa he yaa phir gussa aane ke baad wo kitni jaldi normal ho jaataa he
 4

 On the second day, check if he has made a call or message
 yadi usne ek bhi messej yaa kol nahin kiya he to wo aapaki bilkul bhi care nahin karata
 If they have many messages or calls, then you doubt them and do not give any space in the relationship
 agar limit main colls or messej hai to aap samaj jaaie ki yahi aapke liye sahi jeevanasathi he
 5
 unase kahie ki aapane raat ek dost ke ghar guzari hevaisa kehete hi yadi unke chehre ke haav-bhav badal jate hai to unhen aap par vishwaas nahin he
 6
 uske saamne duusare mard kii tarif kariye:agar uske saamne duusare mard kii tarif karte hi use gussa aa jaataa he to use jarurat he ki wo ladakiyon ke bare main sab chijen jaan le kyonki kisi kii tarif karne kaa yah matlab nahin hota ki aapako wo pasand he
 By doing this, you will be able to understand your partner's mindset

 Rahul said recently that if he is allowed to speak in Parliament for 15 minutes on various issues including corruption, the Prime Minister will not be able to sit for 15 minutes
 rahul ke is bayaan par modi ne yah pratikriya di thi
 Siddaramaiah refuted Modi's claim
 Siddaramaiah also refuted the Prime Minister's claim that the Karnataka government was "indifferent" to the agrarian crisis and was not effectively implementing the crop insurance scheme
 unhone ek anya twit main kaha, ‘‘sar karnataka sarkaar ne pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana ke tahat laagat kaa 50 pratishat bhugtan kiya
 There is only our government in the country, which has deployed IT to directly pay the insurance amount in the farmers' account

 (input ieenes se) (input from IANS) narendra modi jab 15 disambar ko mukhyamantri tathaa jharkhand mukti morcha (jeemem) ke netaa hemanth sorain ke kshetra dumka main chunaav prachaar ke liye gaye to baari bheed dekhakar kaaphi utsahit hue
 Of course, it also showed its impact and the results were won on December 23, when the BJP won the biggest victory with 37 mlas
 phir bhi bhagava kheme main vah utsaah nahin dikh rahaa to uski vajah vah laachaari he jiske chalate use sarkaar banane ke liye sahyogi dal ajasu (ol jharkhand student union) par nirbhar hona pad rahaa he
 This is not a good option, given Ajsu's previous record as an ally
 jharkhand main 2009 main bijepi ke 18 vidhayak the
 This time, despite this number being more than double, the party has five mlas less than a simple majority of 42
 acchhee khabar bas yahi he ki chunaav se pehle kii sahyogi ajasu ke 5 hi vidhayak jite hai
 But the bad news is that the BJP is buried under its thumb
 ajasu par nirbhar rahane kii jo bechaini bijepi aaj bhoga rahi he, uske liye vah khud jimmedaar he
 He won 12 out of 14 Lok Sabha seats in Jharkhand and secured an edge in 56 assembly constituencies
 donon chunaav itani kam avadhi ke antar par hue ki har kisi ko ummid jaagi ki vidhansabha chunaav main bhi loksabhaa chunaav kaa asar rahegaa
 But BJP got 19 seats less than the Lok Sabha
 loksabhaa chunaav main safalataa se bijepi atiutsaah or ghamand main aa gai
 As soon as Modi's popularity was assured, the opposing factions loyal to Arjun Munda and Raghuvar Das got involved in dusting each other and the party lagged behind the majority figure
 bijepi ne 24 disambar tak mukhyamantri pad kaa koi ummidavaar bhale ghoshit na kiya ho, lekin puri sambhaavna he ki chandra prakaash choudhary bijepi-ajasu sarkaar main duusare sabase shaktishaalee netaa honge
 Ramgarh MLA 45-year-old Chaudhary is the senior-most MLA from AJSU after the party chief Mahato's defeat in Silli
 do baar upmukhyamantri rah chuke sudesh mahato ko haar ke baad mantrimandal main jagah milanaa naammumkin he
 In such a situation, his relative Chaudhary would be a comfortable contender for Ajsu for the most important ministry left by BJP
 lekin choudhary kaa daagdar ateet hameshaa sarkaar ke liye sirdard bana rahegaa
 In October 2009, Income Tax officials raided the house of Manoj Kumar Singh, former personal assistant of Chaudhary, for about Rs 14 crore
 kii saavadhi jamaa or darjanon sarkari filein baraamad kii thim
 But a half-incomplete investigation by the Jharkhand Monitoring Bureau could not prove any relationship with Chaudhary
 yahi nahin, may 2012 main rajyasabha main vot ke badale note cond main bhagidaari ke aarope main sibiai ne choudhary ke makaan or daftar par chapa maaraa
 Earlier in August 2010, when the Jharkhand High Court ordered the CBI to investigate the assets of former Chief Minister Madhu Koda and some of his ministers, Chaudhary along with Enosh Ekka, Dulal Bhuiyan, Kamlesh Singh, Bhanupratap Sahi and Bandhu Tirkey Was also named haalanki sibiai unke khilaaf kuch sabit nahin kar pai
 But these disputes had no effect on Chaudhary
 ve jharkhand main halaat sudhaarney ke vaade ke saath satta main aa rahi endie sarkaar main shaamil hone vaale hai
 Informed people may blame the independents and big parties like BJP and JMM for changing the government in Jharkhand repeatedly, but it is also true that AJSU party has got the most benefit of this political instability
 rajya main ab tak bani 9 sarkaron main 6 main ajasu shaamil rahi he
 Party President Sudesh Mahato has been a minister in 5 governments
 ve har endie sarkaar main shaamil rahe hai
 During the Madhu Koda government, Sudesh acted cleverly and sat in opposition with the BJP but party MLA Chandra Prakash Chaudhary got the ministerial chair in the government formed after the fall of Arjun Munda's government
 yah jharkhand kii sabase bhrasht sarkaar kahalaai
 This was a smart move, so that five fingers of Ajsu remained in ghee
 bijepi ke saath vipaksh main baithkar sudesh ne taaliyaan batorin or madhu kodaa sarkaar main mantri bane choudhary ke madhyam se satta kaa majaa bhi liya
 The BJP is now forced to take friends whose conscience is constantly changing
 isaki ek vajah party main raghuvar das or arjuna munda dhadon kii aapasi hode bhi bataai jaati he
 Party leaders also claim that before the election both senior leaders were desperate to win the trust of the central leadership
 unhone tab koi aapatti nahin kii jab sanghathan ke pradesh netaaon ne aise ummidavaaron ko tikat die, jo uske hakdaar nahin the or jin par andeh tha
 For example, BJP gave ticket to Lalchand Mahato from Dumri and ignored his poor condition
 jharkhand kii pehali sarkaar main behad alokapriy urja mantri, jedy(you) vidhayak lalchand mahato ne hi march 2003 main jedy(you) or samta party ke mantriyon ke saath milakar bijepi ko babulal marandi ko mukhyamantri pad se hataane ke liye baadhya kar diya tha
 Mahato later joined the RJD, but could not win the 2005 and 2009 assembly elections
 phir bhi bijepi ne unhen dumri kaa tikat dene laayak samajha
 They lost by a margin of over 32,000
 ajasu ke saath gathjod ke kaaran bijepi ko silli seat ganvaani padi
 JMM candidate Amit Kumar, who defeated Sudesh Mahato, was in BJP, but when the party joined Ajsu, he left with Hemant Soren
 naala seat par bijepi ne satyanand jha ko phir tikat diya, jabaki ye purv mantri tabhi se vivaad main the, jab ek mahila ne agast 2012 main rajya mahila ayog main daawa kiya tha ki vah jha kii patni hai or jha ne unhen or unke bete ko chhod diya he
 The BJP ignored the controversy and paid the price of Jha's defeat on the Nala seat by over 17,000 votes
 bijepi daawa to sushasan ke liye ladgaye kaa karti rahi, lekin jeemem rishwat cond main shaamil rahe or hemanth mantrimandal se baahar kiye gaye simon marandi ko usne littipara se tikat de diya
 Marandi lost by over 25,000 votes
 jeemem se hi nikle hemlaal muramu barhet se haar gaye
 Although Modi himself held a meeting there
 rajdhani ranchi main bijepi ne ajasu ko hatiya seat chhodie par majaboor kiya or party ke sthaneey kaaryakartaaon ko niraash kar ek anjaan chehre seemaa sharma ko khadaa kar diya
 AJSU MLA Naveen Jaiswal won this seat again on the JVM ticket
 hatiya se haar kaa dansh bijepi ko adhik chubhega, kyonki harmu main party mukhyalay hatiya nirvachan kshetra main hi he
 However, according to experts, bjp's list of big mistakes in preparation for elections is very long
 or ab yah sthaneey netaaon hi nahin, dilli darbar main bhi charchaa kaa vishay ban gai he

 Just 24 hours before the Janata Dal (S) and Congress alliance formed the government in Karnataka, BJP President Amit Shah said with full confidence that the National Democratic Alliance (bjp-led NDA) would win a one-sided victory in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 is yakeen kaa aadhaar ve narendra modi sarkaar ke pradarshan or khud pradhanmantri kii lokapriyata ko bataate hai
 But this is one aspect of the coin
 doosraa or shaayad zyada mahatvapurn pahalu jo shah ke jehan main he, vah he satta virdohi rujhaan ko bhaajapa ke paksh main nirnaayak rup se modane kii modi kii kala jiskaa zikr vah yadakada bhaajapa netaaon ke saath karte rahe hai
 From 2009 to 2013, June (nearly four years), the BJP as the main opposition party seemed weak
 june main goa kii rashtriya kaaryakarini main narendra modi ko 2014 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye chunaav abhiyaan samiti kaa pramukh banaaya gaya or baad main pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar
 He turned the anti-incumbency trend against the Manmohan Singh government, which had been in power at the Center for 10 years, in favor of the BJP, for the first time, the BJP managed to get an absolute majority on its own in the Lok Sabha
 yaheen se modi ne vibhinn rajyon main kabiz congress tathaa anya dalon kii sarkaar ke khilaaf jamaa satta virdohi rujhaan ko bhunaane main safalataa pai
 Karnataka was the last milestone of the journey started from Haryana, Maharashtra
 jin rajyon main pichley chaar saal main chunaav hue unamem zyaadaatar main modi ko safalataa mili
 Where success was not achieved, Modi certainly succeeded in increasing vote share for BJP
 masalan, pashchim bengal, kerala, tamilnadu, bihar aadi
 This power of Modi gives Amit Shah the hope that he openly claims that the BJP will win unilaterally in 2019
 shah loksabhaa chunaav kii drushti se yah akalan kar rahe hai ki coromandal rajya (odish-bengal-andhra pradesh) main bhaajapa shandaar pradarshan karegi
 Since there is a non-bjp government in Odisha, West Bengal, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, the BJP and Shah believe that Modi will succeed in favoring the anti-incumbency trend in these areas
 shah pehle bhi kai maukon par yah kah chuke hai ki 2014 main jin rajyon main bhaajapa ko badi safalataa mili vahaan kuch siton kaa nuksaan ho saktaa he
 But at the same time they also add that this will be compensated by the states where the BJP could not win the seat in 2014 or could win only a few seats
 unhone tatiyon rajyon kii aisi 150 siton par party kaa kaam badhaane kii pahal teen saal pehle hi shuru kar di he
 The Coromandel state has a total of 105 Lok Sabha seats (including Telangana)
 shah ko ummid he ki in rajyon bhaajapa chamatkaar kar sakegi
 BJP MP Anil Baluni says that the BJP has worked hard in Bengal and Odisha and has emerged in front of people in both these states as the main opposition party
 party ko ummid he ki 2019 main in rajyon main vah shandaar pradarshan karegi
 The way the Opposition is mobilized against Modi in Karnataka amid the belief of the BJP President and the party, the bjp's path is not that easy
 khaskar jab sachaai yah ho ki modi apni party kii sarkaar vaale rajyon main satta samarthak rujhaan banane main mushkil se hi kaamyaab ho pate hai
 For example, Gujarat and Goa
 gujarat main badi mushkil se bhaajapa kii sarkaar bani or goa main bhaajapa duusare number kii party ban kar rah gai thi
 When the Lok Sabha elections are held in 2019, there will be a BJP government in most states and Modi will not have a chance to speak against these state governments
 *** Social network giant Facebook has made a big announcement
 iske tahat ab fasebuk se White Nationalism or Separatism bain kar diya jayega
 This decision has been taken by Facebook after the Christchurch terror attack in New Zealand where a shooter entered a mosque and killed 50 people

 According to Facebook, over the past three months, the company has spoken to civil society people who are experts on the matter and has confirmed that White Nationalism and Separatism cannot be excluded from the Het group of White White Supermacy
 fasebuk ne is tarah ke contant bain karne se pehle is tarah ke organijeshan kaa rivyuu kiya he or ise khatarnaak bataaya he
 Facebook has said that people can still show pride in their religion, but praise or support for white nationalism and white separatism will not be tolerated
 fasebuk ne kaha he ki is tarah ke contant ko bain karnaa hi ant nahin he, balki company logon ke saath conect hogi jo is tarah ke rashtrawaad or algaavvaad se jude hai
 Facebook has said, 'it is apostolic that some people always try to target our system so that hate can be spread
 hamaara chalange isse aage rahanaa he or lagaataar apni technlogy ko impruva karnaa he, policy ko behatar karte hue exparts ke saath kaam karnaa he

 An FIR has been lodged in Lucknow against Yoga Guru Ramdev for making objectionable statements against Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi

 The police on Saturday took cognizance of this statement of Ramdev and filed a case against him
 is bich exiaar darj hone ke baad press conference kar ramdev ne kaha ki agar unke bayaan se kisi ko dukh hua ha, to wo khed prakat karte he
 Ramdev showed a picture and said that i touch the feet of Dalit women and do the conference

 This shows their attitude towards Dalit women

 samay aa gaya he ki modi is par apana mat spasht karen ki wo ramdev ke bayaan kaa samarthan karte hai yaa nahin
 Modi and Ramdev should apologize to Dalits
 tirath ne kaha ki ye ramdev kii dalit virdohi maansikta he
 He said that Ramdev is a spokesperson for BJP and Modi
 tirath ne kaha ki dalit bheekh nahin, adhikaar maangate hai
 He said that trying to see and know the condition of poor and dalits is not a honeymoon
 shobhaa ojha ne kaha ki ramdev modi kii chandal chaukadi main se ek he
 Ramdev should be arrested in the SC Act by registering an FIR
 unhone kaha ki modi khud naa bolkar kisi or se bulavaa rahe hai
 Dalit women want the answer that the honor of women will be like this
 jashoda ben, ramdev kaa bayaan or snooping cese iske udhaaharan hai
 The BJP defended Ramdev by holding a press conference to respond to the Congress attacks
 shahanvaj hossain ne kaha ki ramdev sant aadmi hai
 He used the English word
 jiskaa galat arth nikaala gaya he
 The BJP spokesperson said that the Congress keeps speaking out loudly against Modi
 aise bayaan ve log dete rahete he
 The Congress should accept its defeat quietly

 gujarat sarkaar ne shuukravaar ko teen nae sansadeey sachivon kii niyukti kii
 Heera Solanki from Koli community, Poonam Makwana from Dalit community and Purnesh Modi from Surat's urban area
 maujuuda sarkaar ne abhi do din pehle hi gujarat main aath sansadeey sachiv banaae the
 But the voices of protest were heard internally on this
 aakhir andolan karne vaale patel samudaay ko up mukhyamantri ke pad ke alaava rajya party adhyaksh kaa pad bhi mila tha
 At the national level, the BJP had made Purshottam Solanki the minister of state in Gujarat, who had been praying for not giving the post to two people of the same family, while his brother Heera Solanki has also got the post of parliamentary secretary
 koshish rajya main sabase bade matadaata samooh coli ko naaraazgi se bachaane kii he
 BJP has made 11 parliamentary secretaries despite 25 ministers, who have been calling for development politics
 ise jatigat sameekaran bithaane ke ganit ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 This is because not only Dalits in Gujarat, but other societies also join the Dalits, a front against the government seems to be forming
 ahmedabad se oona kii dalit asmita yatra ke pehle din hi isamen daliton ke saath badi sankhya main muslim bhi dikhe the
 Jignesh Mevani, the leader of the Dalit movement, made it clear that along with Dalit identity, he is carrying the message against Hindutva and casteism
 unhone kaha tha ki puraa bharat varsh aaj korporate grupon kii pakad main he
 Hindutva is under the grip of Manuwadi and casteist powers
 usase nijaat paane ke liye ham log yah sawaal khadaa karenge ki aazaadee ke itane saalon ke baad samvidhan ke mulyon kaa kya hua? is gujarat model main daliton or vanchiton kaa kya hua, yah sawaal ham puure desh ke saamne rakhana chaahate hai
 The comments patel aarakshan andolan ko lekar gujarat sarkaar ke khilaaf muhim chalaane vaale hardik patel ne bhi daliton ke samarthan kaa elaan kar diya he
 That is why Patel leaders associated with Hardik Patel in many places also welcomed the visit of Dalit
 saal 1985 main aarakshan virodh dangon main jatigat dange bhi hue the jo baad main sampradayik ho gaye the
 To prevent this from happening again, the Muslim community is already joining all the Dalit movements and a declaration of support is being made
 muslim vakil shamashaad pathan ne dalit mahasammelan main hi ghoshnaa kar di thi ki puure hindustan ke musalmaan hameshaa daliton ke saath khadey hai or aage bhi daliton ke saath khadey rahenge
 The current BJP government is definitely a bit shaky due to this growing clan of opponents
 isiilie do dinon ke bheetar hi jatigat sameekaran ne use 11 sansadeey sachiv banane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 In such a situation, for the first time in the last 16 years, the pressure of caste equations is dominating the BJP and the state leadership is weak
 rashtriya str par ek hi parivaar ke do logon ko pad na dene kii duhai dene vaali bhaajapa ne gujarat main purushottam solanki ko rajyamantri banaaya tha to unke bhai hira solanki ko ab sansadeey sachiv kaa pad bhi mil gaya he
 The attempt is to save Koli, the largest voter group in the state, from resentment
 vikaas kii raajnneeti kii duhai dene vaali bhaajapa ne 25 mantriyon ke baavjood 11 sansadeey sachivon banaae hai
 This is being seen as the mathematics of generating caste equations
 yah isliye kyonki gujarat main sirf dalit hi nahin, anya samaajon ke bhi daliton se judane ke kaaran sarkaar ke khilaaf ek morcha banataa dikh rahaa he
 On the very first day of Una's Dalit Asmita Yatra from Ahmedabad, a large number of Muslims along with Dalits were also seen in it
 dalit andolan ke aguva jignesh mewaani ne saaf kar diya ki dalit asmita ke saath hi ve puure hindutv or jatvaad ke khilaaf sandesh lekar chal rahe hai
 He had said that the whole of India is in the grip of corporate groups today
 hindutvvaadi, manuaadi or jativaadee shaktiyon kii giraft main he
 To get rid of it, we will raise the question, what happened to the values of the constitution after so many years of independence? What happened to Dalits and the underprivileged in this Gujarat model, we want to put the question in front of the whole country
 tippaniyan Hardik Patel, who has been campaigning against the Gujarat government over the Patel reservation movement, has also announced the support of Dalits
 isiilie kai jagah hardik patel se jude patel netaaon ne bhi dalit yatra kaa swaagat kiya
 In the year 1985, there were caste riots in the anti-reservation riots which later became communal
 aisa dobaaraa na ho ise rokane ke liye muslim samudaay pehle se daliton ke sabhi andolanon main jud rahaa he or samarthan kii ghoshnaa ho rahaa he
 Muslim lawyer Shamshad Pathan had announced at the Dalit General Conference itself that Muslims from all over India are always standing with Dalits and will continue to stand with Dalits even further
 virodhiyon ke bad rahe is kunbe se maujuuda bhaajapa sarkaar thodi sakapakaai jarur he
 That is why within two days the caste equation forced him to make 11 parliamentary secretaries
 aise main pichley 16 saalon main pehali baar bhaajapa par jatigat sameekaran kaa dabaav haaavee hota dikh rahaa he or pradesh netritv kamjor
 BJP has made 11 parliamentary secretaries despite 25 ministers, who have been calling for development politics

 kisi pratibhavan khilaadi ko kaise apane armaanon kaa galaa ghontna padataa he, isaki jiti-jaagti misaal hai buli basumatari
 28-year-old Bully, who was a national gold medalist in archery, is currently living in Samthabari of Assam by selling her orange by the roadside
 buli kii do ladkiyaan hai
 Buli's husband is a daily wage laborer
 buli kii is vakt chintaa ye he ki santare kaa mausam khatm hone vaala he or phir use ghar baithna padegaa, aise main guzaara kaise chalegaa
 Bully's attachment to archery has not diminished even in economic troubles

 Born in Chirang's farmer family, Buli was fond of archery since childhood
 lekin ghar kii mali haalat khasta hone kii vajah se buli ke liye teerandaji ke aadhunik upkarnon tak pahunch bananaa sambhav nahin tha
 Bully continued to gain proficiency in the sport with a home-made arrow
 jis kshetra main buli kaa ghar tha wo hameshaa se hi jaateey hinsa kii vajah se ashaant kshetra mana jaataa rahaa
 Despite all the difficulties, Buli continued his cultivation
 iskaa fal bhi use mila
 In 20 05, there was a call for a camp organized by the Bully Cosports Authority of India (SAI)
 sahi mauka mila to buli ne peeche mud kar nahin dekha

 buli ko SAI ke training camp se chirang main apane ghar lautnaa padaa
 After a few months she also recovered but then she could not return to the training camp again
 ghar par bhi votirandajike upkaran bahut mahange hone ke kaaran prashikshan jari nahin rakh saki
 Then Buli got married
 buli kii ab do betiyaan hai
 But due to her husband being a daily wage laborer, it was also difficult to raise the bread of June 2
 aise main buli ko khud rojaanaa sadak ke kinare santare bechney padate hai
 Surprisingly, the Bully government or any sports institute has not yet been corrected
 use kahin se bhi dhele kii madad nahin mili
 When the story of Buli reached the Assam government, she is now talking about looking into it

 ) The Narendra Modi government of the Center, which has been facing constant opposition attacks on the issue of agrarian crisis and farmers' plight, has made a big announcement for farmers in their last and interim budget in the election year
 sarkaar ne is bajet main desh ke laghu evam seemaant kisaanon ko 6000 rupee prativarsh dene kaa vaayada kiya he
 The government's bet is being seen as a response to the debt waiver of farmers by newly formed Congress governments in the three states of the Hindi belt after the announcement by Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi apni reliyon main pradhanmantri narendra modi par aksar yah aarope lagaate rahe hai ki sarkaar chand udyogpatiyon kaa karj to maaf karti he, lekin jab baat kisaanon kii karjamaafee kii aati he to kahati he yah hamaari policy nahin he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a recent interview to a news agency, had said on the issue of debt waiver of farmers that if a state forgives debt by its resources, it can
 lekin sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki kisaanon kii samasya kaa hal karj maaf karne se nahin balki unhen majboot karne se hoga, unki kshamta badhaane se hoga
 85% of the total population of farmers in the country are small and marginal farmers
 ye wo kisaan hai jinaki jot apekshaakrit kam he
 In such a situation, the government has announced the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi, for which an amount of Rs 75,000 crore has been allocated
 vahiin, is vittiya varsh ke liye 20,000 karod rupaya aavantit kiya gaya he
 Under this announcement of the Modi government, farmers with land holding of up to 2 hectares will be given Rs 6000 per year directly in their bank account by the Central Government
 yah raashi fasali chakra ko dekhte hue teen kishton main kisaanon ke khate main transfar kii jaaegi
 This scheme of Modi government will benefit 12 crore farmers of the country
 yah yojana 1 disambar, 2018 se lagu ho jaaegi, jisaki pehali kisht jald hi kisaanon ke khate main hogi
 Explain that such scheme is already in operation in some states of the country
 telugana kii ke
 The Chandrasekhar Rao government provides Rs 4000 per acre per season to farmers for support of manure, seeds, pesticides, etc
 - investment in agriculture under the Raitu Bandhu scheme
 iske alaava jharkhand or odisha main bhi isse milti julati yojanaayen chal rahi hai
 The Odisha government has launched the Kalia scheme under which small and marginal farmers get Rs 10,000
 to vahiin jharkhand sarkaar ne is vitt varsh se rajya ke 23 lakh madhyam or seemaant kisaanon ko pratimah 5000 rupee prati acre dene ja rahi he
 At the same time, West Bengal has announced two schemes for agricultural laborers and farmers in the state in which farmers have been asked to pay Rs 5000 per acre in two installments
 centre sarkaar ne is yojana ke jariye ek tir se do nishaanaa lagane kii bhi koshish kii he
 It is worth noting that Congress President Rahul Gandhi, while addressing the Kisan Aabhaar Rally in Chhattisgarh, announced that a plan will be brought to ensure minimum income to the poor of the country when the Congress government comes to the center
 rahul ne kaha tha ki yah apane tarah kii duniya main pehali aisi yojana hogi
 Now the Modi government is looking to try to touch both the environment and the universal basic income on the agrarian crisis, promising to give a certain amount to a large population of farmers

 kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi par tanj kasate hue blog likhaa he
 Jaitley started the blog with the advice given by a senior lawyer in court-court to a junior lawyer
 jetali ne bataaya ki junior vakil ko samajhaayaa jaataa he ki agar aap sakshya main majboot hai to hi saakshyon kaa sahaara len
 If you are proficient in law, then take recourse to law
 vahiin agar aap donon main kamjor hai to mej peetane kaa kaam karen
 With this advice given by junior lawyers, Arun Jaitley said that Rahul Gandhi's advisors are making him above mentioned only for the third option
 jetali aage likhte hai ki raajnneeti main sirf mej peetane se kaam nahin chalegaa, isliye rahul gandhi ke salaahkaar unke liye kaalpanik sachai kaa nirmaan kar rahe hai jiskaa sachai se dur-dur tak lenaa dena nahin he
 Finance Minister Jaitley writes that Rahul Gandhi believes that such false things should be told so many times that he himself seems to be a truth
 iske chalate vah aatm bhram main rahenge or khush honge
 With this Jaitley writes that Rahul Gandhi has introduced this mentality in his speeches and tweets
 phir vitt mantri apni daleel ke paksh main 5 aise maukon kaa varnan karte hai jab rahul gandhi aisa karte paae gaye
 First: Rahul Gandhi is repeatedly saying that private business houses have benefited from Rs 38000 crore to Rs 1,30,000 crore
 phir rahul gandhi daawa karte hai ki jis ladaaku vimaan kaa nirmaan HAL ko karnaa tha ab vah nijee kshetra kii aisi company karne ja rahi he jiske paas is kaam kaa koi tajurba nahin he
 Truth: Rafale is not going to be manufactured in India
 na hi daso dwaara or na hi kisi anya nijee company dwaara
 All 36 aircraft purchased will be brought to India with complete preparation
 vahiin company se qaraar ke tahat kul qaraar kii aadhi keemat kii kharidari daso ko bharat main kerani hogi
 It has 120 offset suppliers in the country and the company under discussion is also one of them
 vahiin maujuuda paristhiti main ukt company ko kul qaraar kaa mahaj 3 fisadi milegaa jisaki anumaanit keemat mahaj 1000 karod rupee hogi
 Second: Rahul Gandhi repeatedly says that when a loan is declared NPA then it will be called debt waiver
 iske baad rahul daawa karte hai ki pradhanmantri ne apane 15 doston ko karjamaafee ke jariye madad kii
 Truth: These corporate loans were given during the UPA tenure
 isamen se ek rupee kii maafee nahin di gai he
 Promoters of such companies have been excluded under the Bankruptcy Act and banks are successfully withdrawing their submerged money from them
 teesraa:rahul gandhi pehle sawaal karte hai ki aakhir kyon mobile phone kaa production bharat main nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 Truth: On his question, he was told that during the tenure of the Congress, only 2 companies were making mobile, while at present 120 companies are engaged in mobile manufacturing
 iske baad rahul gandhi nayaa sawaal kar rahe hai ki aakhir kyon desh main juute-chappal kaa nirmaan nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 Fourth: Rahul Gandhi repeatedly claims that GST has flaws
 sachai:desh main jiesti ko behad safaltaapurvak launch kiya gaya he or puraa desh ek market ban chukaa he
 At the same time, all the states including Congress ruled states have worked with the GST reform

 nyaayamurti bies chouhan or nyaayamurti je chelameshwar kii khandpeeth ne madras ucch nyaayalay ke faisle ke khilaaf ek vakil kii yachika par yah spashtikaran diya
 Some comments about symbiosis were made in the High Court decision
 vakil udai gupta ne is yachika main kaha tha ki ucch nyaayalay kii yah tippanee kanoonee rup se uchit nahin he ki ek vaid vivaah kaa yah matlab jaruri nahi he ki vivaahit dampati ko sabhi paaramparik sanskaron kaa paalan karnaa hoga or phir vidhipurvak sampadit karnaa hoga
 The apex court while disposing of the petition said that it does not consider it necessary to consider it further
 nyaayadhishon ne kaha, 'hamaara mat he ki ye tippaniyan pesh maamle ke tathyon par kii gai hai
 In fact, the judge wanted to say that if a man and a woman live together as husband and wife for a long period of time, even if never married, it would be considered a marriage and the children born to them cannot be considered illegal

 50500, Vacancy in Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL), Vacancy in Punjab Agriculture University, Opportunity to get job in NHAI yun to koi bhi parfect nahin hota lekin apane partner main ham tamaam khubiyaan talashte hai
 Although it is said that girls are more demanding in this case, but the truth is that boys also take care of many things while choosing girlfriends
 ladakon ke man main adarsh garlfriend kii jo chhavi hoti he, vah kuch baton ke aadhaar par bani hoti he
 He wants his partner to be beautiful to look at, but also very mature and mature in practice
 in baton ke alaava ve apni garlfriend main or bhi gun talashte hai
 Know what are the 6 things that every boy wants to see in his ideal girlfriend - 1: Ideal girlfriends go shopping on their own without bothering their boyfriends
 aamtaur par ladakon ko shopping kaa shauk kam hi hota he
 In such a situation, when the girls ask to go shopping together, the boys have a lot of trouble
 khaastaur par tab, jab ladkiyaan adatanusaar ek cheez ko kharidne ke liye 50 dukaan khangaal detii he yaa phir kya luun, isamen moti lag rahi hum kya jaise sawaalon se unako iritate karti hai
 2: Boys always aspire for a girlfriend who molds herself according to him and his family
 ve chaahate hai ki ladkiyaan apane parivaar jitna hi pyaar va sammaan unke parivaar ko bhi den
 3: Boys always wish that they get girlfriends who don't mind their nightouts with friends
 zyaadataraladakiyon ko ladakon ke is tarah ke plance se chidh hoti he
 However, it is because of this that they feel that boys are giving more importance to their friends than them
 4:ye baat hameshaa kahi jaati he ki dil kaa rasta pet se hokar gujarata he or ladke bhi is theory ko maanate hai
 They want their girlfriends to know how to cook better than others and she can cook for them with love and happiness
 5:ladke bhale hi yah na kahen, lekin yah sach he ki baahar khaanaa khaane ke dauraan ladakiyon kaa bill share karnaa yaa phir kai baar puri pement kar dena unako khushi detaa he
 In other words, boys always want that they get such girlfriends that do not loose their pockets more
 6:ek sabase badi kalpana jo adarsh garlfriend ke bare main har ladkaa karata he, vah yah he ki unki garlfriend unhen duusari ladki se flert karte samay na toke
 On this, boys always argue that what is the problem in talking to another girl

 Haji Amirulla came out of the station thinking that he got out of 'kashi Vishwanath' and started looking for a rickshaw! The sun had not yet come out, but Ujala was enough
 baahar chahal-pahal bhi bad gayi thi
 The rickshaws were falling behind the passengers
 lekin haji amirulla ke paas koi bhi rikhshavala nahin aayaa tha
 In fact, all rickshaws were either behind hippies or those who take bath in the Ganges, so that good money can be collected from them
 haji amirulla kii lungi-topi dekhakar hi ve samaj gayi the ki ye sthaneey aadmi hai or inke peeche lagane se koi phayda nahin he
 Haji Amirullah was very upset
 ek rikhshavala taiyaar bhi hua to laga paanch rupee maangane
 Haji saheb started from three rupees to four, but he did not settle down
 or ve duusare rickshawvaale ke paas pahanche, lekin jab kahin safalataa nahin mili to phir usee rickshawvaale ke paas pahunche or paanch rupee hi dene ko taiyaar ho gayi
 But he refused and proceeded with his rickshaw
 tab haji amirulla thodi der tak vahiin gumsum khadey rahe, phir apana saamaan uthaakar paidal hi chal pade
 On going a little further, he saw a rickshawala coming from the front and without stopping, without saying anything, sat on it and said, "come on
" ‘ haji sahab kaa yah saubhaahgya hi tha ki us rickshawvaale ne koi chuun-chapad nahin kii or chupchaap chal padaa
 Haji Amirullah went to Bangalore to see the silk price
 vahaan se dilli hote hue laute hai
 His white lungi journey has become very dirty and various types of stains have been put on the kurtas, but he has no grief, the elder people do not pay much attention to their attire, in which they have greatness
 are inke bade bhai haji matiulla to lungi pahanakar videsh bhi ja chuke hai
 He has traveled to France and America in Lungi
 koun bhosdiyanwala kya kahegaa? videsh ja rahe hai to kya apana tahjibo-tamaddn (sabhyataa or samskruti) chhod den ? unke ghar ke ladke aaj bhi lungi pahanakar scooter chalaate hai, film dekhte hai, sarnath ghoomte hai
 The rickshaw suddenly stopped
 chen utar gai thi
 The rickshawler offered a chain and then left
 sadak behad kharaab thi
 Ballots had come out at various places and pits were formed
 jab kisi gadde main rickshaw kaa pahiyaa padataa to haji amirulla ko lagata ki ab ulat jaayenge or ve bhaybheet ho jate
 But the rickshaw would have recovered
 ve phir mutmain ho jate or sochane lagate
 Silk has become very expensive
 kaarobaar kaise chalegaa? jab se haji amirulla ne apana kaarobaar badhaayaa he tab se bas yahi ek chintaa unhen khaaye ja rahi he ki kaarobaar kaise chalegaa?haji amirulla ne karghe kaa kaam ab kam kar diya he or unke sthaan par powerlooms baitha liye hai
 The seventy thousand rupees that the 'society' received from the government, Haji saheb has used them properly in making powerlooms
 haalaanki latif-vatif ne thodi chuun-chapad kii thi, magar sharfuddinva ne aisa bhabhaka diya ki ek hi jatke main khamosh ho gayi
 Nobody dared again
 powerlooms lag jane se badi aasaani ho gayi he
 Not only this, now through this cooperative society, since their goods are being exported directly, the goods also have to be prepared more
 vaise ek sari ko ek bunakar kam-se-kam chaar dinon main taiyaar karata tha, ab ek powerloom-agar bijli rahi to-ek din main chaar saadiyaan taiyaar karata he
 Although these sarees do not have the same workmanship and carvings, the income is high
 'banarsi sari’ ke aam khariddaar to hote nahin ab- or in saadiyon ko har aamo-khaas kharid letaa he
 But the looms are not completely finished
 kach karghe abhi bhi chal rahe hai
 The shop should have all types of merchandise
 balki sharfuddin ko ek nayaa kaarobaar bhi unhone shuru kara diya he
 He prepares raid saris in his spare time and is now about to start the business of ringing rings
 banaras main jidhar dekhie udhar hi ab pavloom-hi-powerloom nazar aate hai
 Every small and big Giras has a powerloom in it
 duniya badi teji se tarakkee kar rahi he
 Weavers walk the powerlooms overnight in the streets
 xxwrep 6 khater jaise koi antahin railgadee chali ja rahi ho
 Haji Amirulla has ten powerlooms
 haji matiulla, haji ministar or habibulla ne bhi apane-apane gharon main powerloom baitha liye hai
 On the other hand, Haji Waliullah Giras, the future brother of Haji Amirulla, already had many powerlooms here and there and has come and has now made his important place among the few rich nobles
 apane ko ve alipura ilaake ke laat swaleh (banaras ke ek rais ansaari) samajhate hai
 Haji Rasid, Haji Samtullah, Haji Nazir and Baul Dabba etc
 have also set up powerlooms at their respective places
 is prakaar puure ilaake main ab ek antahin railgadee nirantar chalaa karti he or muhallewaalon kii neend haraam kiya karti he
 But what does Haji Amirullah have to do with this? His first important concern is how the price of silk fell down? Due to this, several weavers of Banaras, Maunath Bhanjan and Mubarakpur had also gone on strike due to their good efforts and their condition had become worse
 lekin koi khaas fark abhi nahin padaa he
 The question was going to be raised in Parliament about this attack, i do not know what happened? If the business is well established, then there are two things to do this year
 habibulla ko haj ke liye bhejnaa he or sharfuddin kaa byaah karnaa he
 
 
 Right now they thought of something else too, but the rickshaw reached their door and they landed
 utarate vakt unki lungi rickshaw main kahin funskar charr-se fat gayi
 No problem
 ghar ke bacchon ne haji sahab ko rickshaw se utarate hue dekhakar thodi der tak shor kiya, phir agra vaala petha khaakar khamosh ho gayi
 Haji Saheb went to the Pakhana
 vahaan der tak baithe-baithe kuch sochate rahe
 Then he got out and took a bath and after having breakfast he sat on the throne
 sharfuddin ne unke saamne kai din ke akhbaar rakh diye
 'aaj', 'dainik Jagran' and 'qaumi Ekta'
 "kamruva kahan gavaa be?""gangaji gavaa he, nahaaye
 'haji saheb was a little dissatisfied with the answer to his question and picked up each newspaper and looked at it cursoryly
 haji sahab ko hindi bahut kam aati he, par kaamchalaoo pard-padhaa lete hai
 Suddenly, on a news story published in Dainik Jagran, his eyesight fell like a nail

 afsos he ki aaropee ko police ne pakad liya, lekin samay par cese darj nahin kiya
 ' 27 july kii raat ko is sadi kaa sabase lanbaa chandragrahan lagane vaala he
 There will be a wonderful sight in the sky
 is baar kaa chandra grahan bharat ke kone-kone se dikhegaa lekin monsoon hone kii vajah se kahin par badal honge to kahin par aasmaan saaf hoga
 To see the amazing view of the full lunar eclipse, you will have to stay awake till late night, but if you miss seeing this view then you will not get to see such a vision again in this century
 chandragrahan kab he? (today Chandra Grahan time)27 july yani aaj 21veen sadi kaa sabase lanbaa chandragrahan hone vaala he
 This lunar eclipse has been named 'blood Moon'
 isaki kul avadhi 6 ghanta 14 minute rahegi
 In this, the position of full moon eclipse will be for 103 minutes
 is saal kaa pehla chandragrahan janvari ke maheene main padaa tha, lekin 27 july yani aaj raat hone vaala chandragrahan isse kahin zyada prabhaavshaalee mana ja rahaa he
 The lunar eclipse time (chandra Grahan kitne baje hai) The lunar eclipse will begin on 27th July i
e
 tonight from 11 to 54 minutes according to Indian time
 dhire-dhire prithvi kii chaaya chand par padani shuru ho jaaegi
 The moon will be completely covered by the shadow of the Earth around 1 pm late 28 July
 raat kariban 3 bajkar 49 minute par prithvi kii chaaya se chand baahar aayega
 On July 28, around 5 o'clock, the moon will completely come out of the Earth's sparse shadow
 chandra grahan ke samay chand zyada chamkila or bada najar aayega isamen prithvi ke madhyakshetra kii chaaya chandramaa par padegi
 The lunar eclipse begins simultaneously and ends simultaneously throughout the world
 lekin yah is baat par nirbhar he ki vahaan par raatri kaa koun sa samay chal rahaa he
 Somewhere in the evening, it will be seen during or after the moonrise, and somewhere in the morning it will be around the moon, but in India, the lunar eclipse is starting here in the middle of the night
 lihaaja desh ke sabhi sthanon par yah ek saath shuru hoga or ek saath hi khatm hoga
 This is Sutak timing for Chandra Grahan
 This eclipse is 3 hours 55 minutes
 grahan kaa sparsh kaal raatri 11: 54 minute par, madhya kaal raatri 1:52 par evam moksh kaal raatri 3: 49 minute par he
 The sutak period of the lunar eclipse has started at 2:54 in the day
 jo bhi shubh kaary ho, vah sabhi kaary sutak kaal se purv hi kar lenaa shreyaskar hota he kyonki aaj ke din hi guru poornima bhi he
 Therefore, all people who perform religious activities for Guru Purnima, should do religious work within the first i
e
 2:54 minutes of the Sutak period
 chandra grahan or surya grahan main antar (difference between Surya grahan and chandra grahansurya grahan ke dauraan chandramaa kii chaaya prithvi par padati he, vahiin chandragrahan ke samay prithvi kii chaaya chandramaa par padati he
 The Earth's shadow is much larger than the Moon's shadow, due to which the lunar eclipse lasts longer than the solar eclipse
 kya hota he chandragrahan (what is Chandra Grahan)jab surya or chandramaa ke bich prithvi aa jaati he to surya kii puri roshni chandramaa par nahin padati he
 This is called lunar eclipse
 jab surya, prithvi or chandramaa ek saral rekha main hote hai to chandragrahan kii sthiti hoti he
 The lunar eclipse always occurs on the full moon night
 ek saal main adhiktam teen baar prithvi ke upachaaya se chandramaa gujarata he, tabhi chandragrahan lagata he
 Like solar eclipse, lunar eclipse can be partial and complete
 chandra grahan kyon hota he? (what Causes Chandra Grahan)iskaa sidhaa sa jawaab he ki chandramaa kaa prithvi kii oot main aa janaa
 In that case the Sun is on one side, the Moon on the other side and the Earth in the middle
 jab chandramaa dharti kii chaaya se nikalataa he to chandra grahan padataa he
 Why does the moon only appear in red during a full lunar eclipse? (what is blood moon? why moon turns red) When the sunlight passes through different layers of the Earth's atmosphere, the seven colors of the light are scattered at different angles
 inamen varnakram kaa laal vaala hissaa kuch zyada hi mudata he
 This light of the sun first reaches the surface of the moon, due to which the moon does not completely dissipate at the time of complete eclipse, but we see it in red
 purna chandragrahan kii avasthaa main chandramaa kii chamak saamaanya poornima ke mukaable 500 guna kam ho jaati he
 The effect of the eclipse lasts for about 120 days
 isamen bhi ek chandra chakra arthath gurupurnima se shravan poornima tak vishesh satarkta baratane kii jarurat he
 The maximum impact of this lunar eclipse will be on the zodiac sign of the Earth element, because the lunar eclipse will occur in this amount
 saath hi grahan se mesh, singh, vrishchik evam min raashi ke jaatakon ko phayda milegaa
 Natives of Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Virgo, Libra, Sagittarius, Capricorn and Aquarius can cause damage
 chandragrahan poornima ke din hi padataa he? (chandra Grahan on full moon)chandra grahan poornima ke din padataa he lekin har poornima ko chandra grahan nahin padataa he
 The reason for this is that the Moon's orbit is bent on the Earth's orbit
 yah jhukaav takreeban 5 degree he isliye har baar chandramaa prithvi kii chaaya main pravesh nahin karata
 It escapes from the top or bottom
 yahi baat suryagrahan ke liye bhi sach he
 Solar eclipses are always on the new moon day because the size of the moon is about 4 times less than the size of the earth
 isaki chaaya prithvi par choti aakaar kii padati he isiilie purnataa kii sthiti main surya grahan prithvi ke ek chote se hisse se hi dekha ja saktaa he
 But in the event of a lunar eclipse, the Earth's shadow is much larger than that of the Moon
 lihaaja isse guzarane main chandramaa ko zyada vakt lagata he
 Where to see the lunar eclipse- (india and When to Watch Chandra Grahan) Apart from India, this lunar eclipse will be seen from Africa, South Asia, Australia and South America
 lekin bharat main yah chandragrahan shuruyaat se lekar ant tak dekhne ko milegaa

 It is believed that a lunar eclipse can cause harm to the fetus in several ways
 isliye garbhvatee mahilaon ko grahan ke dauraan khaas saavdhaanee baratane kii salaah di jaati he
 Let's know according to astrological belief, what precautions should be taken by pregnant women during eclipse to avoid the ill effects of lunar eclipse
 chandragrahan ke dauraan garbhvatee mahilaon ko ghar ke andar hi rahane kii salaah di jaati he
 It is believed that the life of a child born in the womb at the time of lunar eclipse is at risk
 chandragrahan ke dauraan garbhvatee mahilaon ko koi bhi nukili yaa dhar vaali chijen istemaal nahin karnaa chahie
 It is believed that cutting vegetables and fruits during eclipse can prove dangerous for the child
 garbhvatee mahilaon ko chandragrahan ke dauraan kuch khaane se bachanaa chahie

 In spite of the pressure, India maintained its stand on Palestine's claim of membership in the United Nations and reiterated its commitment to its relations with Iran
 in donon hi masalon par uski raay america se bilkul alag he
 Despite US opposition, India expressed support for the Palestinian request a few hours after Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas claimed his country's membership of the United Nations as an independent nation on Friday
 bhartiya videsh sachiv ranjan mathai ne shuukravaar ko is baat ke sanket die ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main apane sambodhan ke dauraan philistin kii is maang kaa samarthan kar sakate hai
 Despite Mathai refusing to preview the Prime Minister's speech, he said, "our stand on Palestine is clear
 yah sarvavidit he ki hamane 1988 main hi philistin ko alag raashtra ke rup main manyata de di thi
 If we repeat our stand, it should not be surprising
 " unhone bataaya ki abbaas kii is aitihaasik daavedaari ke kuch ghante baad hui manmohan singh va irani raashtrapati mahmud ahmadinejad kii mulaakaat main donon netaaon ne sanyukt raashtra main philistin kii sadsyta ke liye uski ore se kiye ja rahe prayaason kaa samarthan doharaaya
 Similarly, a day after Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's aggressive speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called on him, reiterating his commitment to close ties with Iran
 mahasabha main ahmadinejad ke bhaashan ke dauraan america kii aguwai vaale pashchimi deshon ke pratinidhi baahar chale gaye the
 India's Foreign Secretary Ranjan Mathai told reporters on Friday, "the meeting was predetermined and mainly focused on bilateral relations
 " samvaadadaataaon ne mathai se jaananaa chaha tha ki bharat dwaara philistin kaa samarthan karne or ahmadinejad se mulaakaat karne kaa america ke saath uske rishton par asar padegaa
 Mathai said that meeting Ahmadinejad, supporting Palestine and not meeting with US President Barack Obama does not imply a freeze in india-us relations
 anya bhartiya adhikariyon kii tarah mathai ne bhi manmohan singh or obama kii mulaakaat na ho paane kii vajah bataate hue kaha ki pradhanmantri, obama ke neuyark se ravaanaa ho jane ke baad yahaan pahunche hai
 But after the departure of Manmohan Singh on Monday, the foreign ministers of India and America can hold talks on the same day
 maharashtra main sarkaar gathan ko lekar mukhpatr 'saamana' main bijepi par prahaar'saamana' ne likhaa- nae sameekaran banate dekh kai logon ke pet main dard shuruumaharashtra main shivasena, congress or ensipi kii sarkaar banane kaa rasta takreeban saaf ho gaya he
 The Common Minimum Program (CMP) has also been created
 shivasena, ensipi or congress ke bich mantriyon ko lekar 14-14-12 kaa formula bhi tay ho gaya he
 It has also been decided that the Chief Minister will belong to Shiv Sena
 is bich bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne ek baar phir maharashtra main sarkaar banane kaa daawa kiya he
 At the same time, Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'saamana' has published an article targeting the BJP
 mukhpatr 'saamana' ne likhaa he ki maharashtra main nae sameekaran se kuch logon ke pet main dard shuru ho gaya he
 i see who forms a government, this type of language is being spoken, curses are also being given that if the government is formed then how many more days will it last
 aisa 'bhavishya' bhi bataaya ja rahaa he ki 6 maheene se zyada sarkaar nahin tikegi
 This new business may be profitable, but it is a violation of blind faith law
 '105 waalon ke swasthya ke liye khatarnaak''saamana' ne bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate hue likhaa apni kamajori ko chupaane ke liye ye harakat maharashtra ke saamne aa rahi he
 We are the owners of Maharashtra and the father of the country, if anyone thinks that they should come out of this mindset
 ye maansik avasthaa 105 waalon ke swasthya ke liye khatarnaak he
 If this situation is prolonged then the mental balance will deteriorate and the journey towards madness will begin
 kal aae netaa ko janata pagal yaa murkh sabit kare ye hamen thik nahin lagata
 One is that his game is started in the name of a leader like Narendra Modi and Modi's name is getting spoiled in it
 'saamana' ne likhaa, maharashtra main raashtrapati shashan lag gaya he or raashtrapati shashan lagane ke baad 105 waalon kaa aatmavishvaas is prakaar jhaag banakar nikal rahaa he maano mumbai kinare ke arab sagar kii lehren oochaal maar rahi hon
 Former Chief Minister Fadnavis said very politely to his mlas that stay cool, only BJP government is coming in the state again
 kal hi bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha ki rajya main jiske paas 145 kaa aankada he uski sarkaar aegi or ye sanvaidhanik rup se sahi he
 '105 has cleared meeting the Governor', 'samana' further wrote, Now those who are saying that now the BJP government will come, those of 105 have already met the Governor and clearly said that we do not have majority, so We are unable to form a government, as soon as the President's rule seems to be saying, 'now it is only our government'
 The majority that they did not have before will come out of the fold of President's rule
 This is a question but we can add 'figure' by blending democracy and morality, as the language does not suit the tradition of Maharashtra
 phir aisa bolne vaale kisi bhi party kaa ho
 The plan to establish a horse market under the guise of President's rule is now clear
 'nepolian or sikandar jaise yoddha bhi aae or gaye''saamana' ne likhaa, svachh or paardarshee kaam karne kaa vachan dene waalon kaa yah jhooth he or ye baar-baar sabit ho rahaa he
 No one takes birth with power or the chief minister's post
 khud ko vishwavijeta kehane vaale nepolian or sikandar jaise yoddha bhi aae or gaye
 Shriram also had to leave the state
 aurangzeb aakhir jameen main gaada gaya, to ajey hone kii laffaaji kyon? ek taraf fadanvis 'rajya main phir se bhaajapa kii hi sarkaar' kaa daawa karte hai or duusari taraf nitin gadakari ne cricket kaa rabadi ball raajnneeti main phenk diya he
 Nothing happens in cricket and politics
 kisi bhi kshan faisla badal saktaa he
 One can win in a hand-held match, 'gadkari has said
 ' gadakari kaa cricket se sambandh nahin''saamana' ne aage likhaa, gadakari kaa cricket se sambandh nahin he
 They are related to cement, ethanol and bitumen etc
 sambandh he to sharad pavaar or cricket kaa he
 Now Jai Shah, son of party president Amit Shah, has become the secretary of the Indian Cricket Board, so the bjp's official connection to cricket has been added
 gadakari kehete hai us prakaar se cricket main aakhir tak kab kya hoga, iskaa koi bharosa nahin
 Nowadays cricket game has become less and business is more and in the game of cricket too 'horse market' like politics has started
 raajnneeti main satta bazaar kaa jor he
 In the same way, in cricket too, that game of 'manipulation' and 'fixing' has started in the field, so there remains doubt about whether the game wins or fixing wins
 isliye gadakari dwaara maharashtra ke raajnneetik khel ko cricket kaa romaanchak khel kii oopaadhi dena thik hi he
 'the mental balance of the shouters will deteriorate', 'samna' wrote that in politics, which requires a neutral decision, the hope of joining (or being mixed) with that 'panch' will only awaken the confidence like 'now our own government' This will awaken, but there is a stick named Stump on the ground
 use haath main lekar janata tumhaare sir main ghusaae bina nahin rahegi
 An outcry like 'our Government again' is tearing the ears of Maharashtra
 is prakaar janata badhir ho jaaegi, lekin chillaanewaalon kaa maansik santulan bighad jayega
 We are worried, the news of increasing number of lunatics in Maharashtra is an obstacle in the reputation of the state
 ham un sabko phir se prem purvak salaah dete hai ise itnaa dil se mat lagaao
 'man's son is subjugated in the world' Just like there is no one is invincible, it is also true
 maharashtra main satya kaa bhagava laharaayega

 JDU and LJP are contesting elections under the banner of NDA, two important allies of BJP in Jharkhand elections, Shiv Sena, bjp's oldest ally, has walked out of NDA and will sit in opposition camp in both houses of Parliament

 This is a matter of concern for any coalition because even after a strong coalition, if there is a message among the people that the coalition can break even after the election, then the vote can go into the anti-faction
 chunki bihar main agle saal chunaav hone hai or vahaan muslim kai siton par nirnaayak bhoomika main hai
 Therefore, JDU may suffer the loss of being more close to the BJP

 maharashtra ke latur jile kii ek factory main tanks saaf karte samay jahrili gas kii chapet main aane se saat kamgaaron kii maut ho gai
 Officials said late Monday evening that some workers fainted while cleaning the tank at the Kirti Oil Mill
 tippaniyan a few other workers then went inside the tank to find out about them, but they did not exit
 in logon kii jahrili gas se maut ho gai
 Investigation has been started in this case
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) iske baad kuch anya kaamgaar unke bare main pataa karne ke liye tanks ke bheetar gaye, lekin ve baahar nahin nikle
 These people died of poisonous gas
 is maamle main jaanch shuru kar di gai he
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 )(hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) vighnaharta bhagwaan shri ganesh kaa ek aisa dham bhi he, jahaan bappa apane bhakton ko viraat rup main darshan dete hai
 Not only this, like his giant statue, Ganapati takes away even the greatest grief of his devotees and gives them the blessing of happiness
 nagpur ke adasa ganpati ke darshan kar bhakton kaa jivan dhanya ho jaataa he
 This is the journey of faith in which the ups and downs are greater, but by reaching the floor, the fatigue disappears
 yahaan pahunchakar sharir hi nahin man bhi shant ho jaataa he
 Bappa's Dham is situated on the mountains amidst greenery in the nature of nature
 jahaan bappa kii bhavy pratimaa or unke mandir ko dekhakar lagata he jaise kisi mahal main koi raja badi hi bhavyata ke saath virajman ho
 Even if this is the case, the glory of Adasa Ganapati is such that the devotees are always drawn towards this shrine
 adasa gaanv nagpur se 50 ki
 M
 dur basaa he or is gaanv main pahadiyon ke bich virajman adasa ganpati bhakton kaa kalyaan karte hai
 In this form, Bappa also solves the biggest problem of devotees and frees them from all worries
 adasa ganpati kii ye pratimaa kareeb 11 feet oonchi or 7 feet chaudee he or swayambhu he jo ek hi pathar se nirmit he
 Just by offering Durva, Bappa fills his devotees with happiness
 bappa kii is murat ko dekhne bhar se bhakt apana dukh bhul jate hai or manachaaha vardaan maang kar le jate hai
 It is believed that whatever the crisis may be, Siddhi Vinayak's philosophy cuts the mountains of difficulties and clouds of sorrow are cut
 baat chaahe naukari kii ho yaa sukh shanti kii, santan kii kaamana ho yaa ho achche rishte kii aas, vinayak ke darshan se puure ho jate he saare kaam
 It is said that Lord Vishnu also worshiped Bappa's Shami Ganesha form in Vamana avatar
 ganpati jis par bhi meharbaan ho jate hai, us par sari krupa lutaa dete hai
 Be it a king or a rake, a saint or a fakir
 bhakt ho yaa phir bhagwaan
 This thing can be understood by taking obeisance in the court of Adasa Ganapati
 kehete hai jab samudr manthan ke dauraan devataaon ko amrit kii prapti hui or asuron ko paraajay kaa saamana karnaa padaa tab swarg par apana adhipaty sthapit karne ke liye guru shukracharya ke kehane par raja bali ne ashwamegh yajna karnaa aarambh kiya
 To prevent King Bali from being successful in this yajna, Lord Vishnu was born as a Vamana avatar from the womb of Devamata Aditi and demanded 3 feet of earth from King Bali
 vaaman puraana ke anusaar jab vaaman rup main bhagwaan vishnu raja bali ke paas pahunche usase pehle unhone adasa gaanv ke isi sthaan par bhagwaan ganesh kii aradhana kii thi
 Pleased with penance, Lord Ganesha appeared from the tree of Shami and appeared to Lord Vamana and gave his blessings and hence Ganapati also came to be called as Shami Ganesh here
 hajaaron saal puraani bappa kii is pratimaa ke darshan kar bhakt unke darbar main hone vaali aarti ke gavaah banate hai
 Which fills the light of expectations in their lives
 is darbar main aane vaale har bhakt kii jubaan par ganpati kaa naam hota he or har hriday main basate hai ekadant bhagwaan jinaki ek jhalak paakar bhakt apni muraad puri hone kii fariyaad karte hai
 Vasant Panchami is a grand celebration of the birth of Lord Ganesha
 us samay deshbhar se hajaaron shraddhalu yahaan umad padate hai
 It is believed that women deprived of the happiness of their children get a special blessing of Bappa here
 vinayak darshan dekar bhakton kaa jivan hi safal nahin karte, uski ichchhaaon ko puraa kar jivan kii raah bhi aasaan bana dete hai

 balki ye faisla isliye liya gaya he ki isse bade hue aakaar par vigyaapan chhapakar paise kamaaye ja saken
 Railway Board, in its order sent to the zonal railways, has said that the details of the passenger ticket on the large size ticket will remain the same as before, but in the remaining space, the zonal railways can earn money by printing different advertisements
 piares tikat ke peeche vaale hisse main 30 fisadi jagah par yatriyon ke liye nirdesh chaape jaaenge to vahiin 70 fisadi jagah par vigyaapan chaape jaaenge
 Overall, the Railways has increased the PRS ticket size to increase its revenue
 yatriyon ko ho sakati he asuvidharailvay ne bhale hi apni aamadani badhaane ke iraade se piares tikat kaa sies badha diya ho lekin bade aakaar ke tikat ko sambhalakar jeb rakhana aasaan nahin hoga
 According to the railway passengers, it is not easy to keep the current ticket due to its size, so if it is 64 percent more size then it will not be possible to keep it in your pocket or purse
 yani nae aakaar ke tikat ko modatod kar hi rakhana hoga
 More paper will be cut, more trees, the second big loss to increase the size of PRS ticket is the loss of environment
 tikat kaa sies badhaane kii vajah se railway tikat main kaagaj kii khapat takreeban 64 fisadi zyada bad jaaegi
 This means that more trees will be cut on the earth to make paper for tickets of increased size

 pakistan ke pradhan mantri navaj sharif apane desh kii samasyaon ko to sulajhaa nahin paa rahe hai, kashmir kaa mudda sulajhane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Today, Nawaz Sharif in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir heard India very well and later talked about finding a solution to this problem through dialogue
 pakistan 5 farvari ko kashmir ekajutata diwas manaata he or us din vahaan sarkari chuttee hoti he
 On this occasion Nawaz Sharif reached pok and gave a speech in Azad Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly there
 unhone chetavanee di ki kashmir mudda nahin sulajhaa to isi tarah ladaaiyaan hoti rahengi
 Pakistan newspaper Dawn reported this
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar or pakistan kii janata kashmir ekajutata diwas manaa rahi he
 On this occasion, we support the struggle of the Kashmiri people
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki kashmir kii janata ke saath atyaachaar ho rahe hai
 They are being crushed and treated inhumanely
 unhone khule shabdon main kaha ki kashmir ke logon par amanviya atyaachaar ho rahe hai
 Sharif also alleged that thousands of Kashmiris have lost their lives and thousands are lodged in Indian jails
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki kashmiri log sanyukt raashtra charter ke anusaar apane bhagya kaa nirdhaaran karnaa chaahate hai
 He said that Pakistan will continue to support the Kashmiri people in their struggle
 lekin baad main sharif thode thande pad gaye or unhone bharat se kaha ki vah is mudde par pakistan se sampurna or faldaayi baatcheet kare
 He said that both the countries should resolve the issue peacefully
 pakistan banane ke baad se hi kashmir vahaan ke netaaon ke liye ek aisa mudda rahaa he, jiskaa ve hameshaa raajnneetik dhang se istemaal karte hai
 Whenever they fail to solve the problems of their country, they raise the issue of Kashmir
 yahi kaaran he ki navaj sharif ne bhi is saal yah maamla puri takat se uthaa diya he
 He too seems unable to do anything for Pakistan battling poverty, illiteracy and terrorism
 aise main janata kaa dhyaan bhatakaane ke liye vah aise bhaashan de rahe hai

 Deepika has performed on the Ghoomar dance, considered part of the Rajputana civilization in the song
 yah padmavati kaa pehla gaanaa he jise mekars ne relies kiya
 How did Deepika go for Ghoomar? Ghoomar dance is an important part of Rajasthan's tradition
 isamen lambey ghaghare or ghunght odhakar gol ghere main ghumkar dance kiya jaataa he
 This is the collective dance that women perform
 ghumar gane main deepika ne achche se step follow kiya he
 In many places, he looks fantastic
 lekin paaramparik ghumar ke mukaable unka dance thodaa kamjor najar aata he
 It may have happened due to the grandeur of the film
 adivaasiyon kaa dance bana rajavaadon kii parampara, padmavati main deepika ne kiya 'ghumar'set ke aage ghumar kii bhavyata dabiisanjay lila bhansaali ne signechar style ko gane main bhi shaamil karne se nahin roak paaen hai

 Lyrics are well made which give comfort to the ears and keeping it completely traditional, it also has a Bollywood style temper
 padmavati: gym ne liye 70 lakh, jaane deepika, shahid, ranvir kii fisaparfect he deepika kaa ghumar gemepaghunghat, ghaghara or latakan ghumar kii pahchaan he
 Deepika's entry before Ghoomar Nach is awesome

 In many places, she has been seen following the best steps
 gane kii baat karen to shreya khoshaal or swarup khan kii aawaaj main gaaya gaya padmavati ke ghumar gane ko antertaning to kaha ja saktaa he
 Mix reviews are also being received on social media regarding this song
 kuch log film ke is gane ko khub saraah rahe hai to kuch ko is gane se khub niraashaa bhi hui he
 One user has written about the song, being Rajasthani was disappointing, i was eagerly waiting for this song but now i feel bad
 Disappointed

 This dance is performed by most women wearing a veil and wearing a curved dress called 'ghaghra'
 ghumar jyatad khaas maukon, jaise shaadi, holi, tyoharon or dharmik aayojanon main kiya jaataa he
 Ghoomar's songs may focus on royal and royal legends and their traditions

 The company continued to cancel flights for the fifth consecutive day and its share fell to an all-time low of 19 per cent but later improved somewhat
 sutron ne bataaya ki sankat kii gambhirtha is baat se spasht hoti he ki kingfisher ke maalik vijay maalya ne vitt mantri pranav mukherjee or nagar vimaanan mantri vylar ravi se apil kii he ki kam byaaj daron par bainkon ke jariye madad kii jaae

 desh bhar main baari sankhya main kingfisher kaa tikat radd karakar yatriyon ne anya vimaanan company kii sevaayen leen
 However, for this, they had to pay 20 to 40 percent more price at the last moment
 kingfisher ne isse pehle kaha tha udaanen 19 aktubar ke baad vyavasthit ho jaaengi lekin ab sanket diya he ki udaanon ko saamaanya sthiti main aane main or kuch hafte lagenge
 The company's CEO Sanjay Aggarwal said that it has been decided to reduce the number of flights on some air routes such as delhi-mumbai, in addition to freeing up their aircraft for business class seats and its recruits
 iske alaava kam yatriyon vaale nanded-mysore vayumargon par bhi udaanen kam kii jaaengi
 He said that this is being done to rationalize the airways so as to increase profits and income productivity of flights
 yah poochne par ki kya nagar vimaanan mahanideshaalay dwaara jari kaaran bataao notice kaa jawaab diya he agarwal ne kaha ki ham unase sampark main hai
 We have told them that the flights are being temporarily canceled
 ham unhen suchit karte rahenge
 The Directorate General had asked Kingfisher under Rule 140 (A) of the Aircraft Rules, 1937, as to why the company did not seek prior approval from the regulator under this rule to reduce flights
 yah bhi poocha gaya ki kya vimaanan company ne un yatriyon kii madad kii jinhen udaanen radd hone se asuvidha hui
 State-run oil companies (HPCL, IOC and BPCL) have refused to provide loan facility to the Mallya-owned airline and asked them to pay jet fuel daily

 The farmer can then sell his crop online in that market

 Through the reward system, the farmer will get the right price for the crop
 gauratlab he ki pichley dinon jis tarah madhya pradesh or maharashtra main kisaanon ne andolan kiya tha, use dekhte hue pradhanmantri ne kisaanon ke liye kisaan sampada yojana kii planning kiya he
 Through this, the farmer can get the right price for his crop and use it differently

 And if the finished crop is wasted, he will get the insurance money for it
