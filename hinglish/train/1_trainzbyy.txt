 Referring to reports of a woman starting to undress in front of the RBI regional office due to some old notes not being changed in Delhi, the Shiv Sena said the condition of that ill-fated mother looked like a 'government-sponsored Nirbhaya scandal'
 shivasena ne apane mukhpatr 'saamana' main ek sampadakeey main likhaa, "ham mukhyamantri (maharashtra) se poochna chaahate hai ki aap kiski taraf hai
 On the side of demonetisation or this helpless woman

 The Shiv Sena wrote in an editorial in its mouthpiece 'saamana', "we want to ask the Chief Minister (maharashtra) whose side are you on
 notebandi kii taraf yaa is asahaay mahila kii ore
 If the government could not see and understand the pain of this woman, then such a ruthless and deaf government would not have been there in the last 10 thousand years
 " party ne kaha, "agar koi mahila pareshaani main dilli kii sadak par baithti he or sarkaar kii ninda karti he to yah sarkaar pryojit nirbhaya cond kii tarah he
 "the Shiv Sena said that the victim has brought out the sobbing and resentment of women on the streets
 party ne kaha, "agar aap is mahila ke nirvastr hone ko bhi deshbhakti kehete hai to aapako jarurat he ki aapke dimag kaa ilaaj koi talibani doctor kare
 Such excesses against women occur only under Taliban rule
 " notebandi kaa samarthan karne ke liye mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ko aade haath lete hue shivasena ne kaha ki agar mukhyamantri ko is mahila kii pidaa dekhakar koi dukh nahin hota to vah ek asahaay vyakti hai

 bihar vidhansabha main duusare din bhi mantri abdul jaleel mastaan ko barkhaast karne kii maang ko lekar hangaamaa hota rahaa
 Although Jalil Mastan had apologized but despite this the BJP is adamant on dismissing him
 usne rajyapal se mulaakaat kar is maamle main dakhal dene kii maang kii
 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav says that because of the Uttar Pradesh elections, the BJP is touting the matter
 abdul jaleel mastaan ne kaha ki maafee to maang lee he ab kya faansee chadhaaenge
 In a viral video of Bihar's Minister for Excise and Prohibition Minister Mastan, not only objectionable words were used on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but his supporters were also seen shoes on his picture against demonetisation
 ye sab mantri ke saamne purniya kii ek raily main hua tha
 This video of Bihar's prohibition minister Abdul Jalil Mastan continued to heat political mercury in Bihar for the second day
 vidhansabha or vidhaan parishad ko donon sadanon main endie ne hangaamaa kiya or sadan ko nahin chalane diya
 Despite lakhs of efforts of the Speaker, the BJP and NDA members came and shouted slogans
 vipaksh ke tevar se sahame jaleelavipaksh asana ke saamne naare laga rahaa tha ki pradhanmantri kaa apmaan nahin sahegaa hindustan
 The opposition stood firm on the demand to sack the minister
 abdul jaleel mastaan vipaksh ke is tevar se sahame hue to the lekin unhone kaha ki ab maafee maang lee he, kya faansee par chadhaaenge
 He said that Union Minister Giriraj Singh made many such statements why he was not dismissed
 congress cote ke mantri hai jalilapako bataa den ki abdul jaleel mastaan congress cote se mantri hai
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has already condemned his statement, now the whole Congress is on the high command
 congress ke pradesh adhyaksh or bihar ke shiksha mantri ashok choudhary ne bayaan ko galat to bataaya lekin barkhaasti se unhen etraj he
 He says the minister has apologized
 unhone bijepi ke puraane bayanon kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki bijepi ke netaaon ne kai baar congress ke netaaon kaa apmaan kiya he
 NDA is not ready to bow down
 NDA has no meaning in these arguments, it just wants dismissal
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar dwaara koi nirnay nahin lene se naaraaz endie ke netaaon ne rajbhavan march kiya or rajyapal ko gyaapan saunpa
 Former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi says that what Abdul Jalil Mastan did cannot be forgiven
 maafee use di jaati he jo sleep of tang ho
 He appealed to the Congress leaders not only to sack Mastan but also to expel him from the Congress party
 lalu bhi naarajamastan ke bayaan par argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav bhi naaraazgi jataa chuke hai
 He said that Congress should take action
 lekin unke bete or bihar ke upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav kaa ruukh kuch alag he unhone kaha ki wo bayaan kii ninda kar chuke hai
 The minister has also demanded his resignation
 lekin vipaksh kuch sunne ko taiyaar nahin he
 They allege that due to the Uttar Pradesh elections, this matter is being further tilted so that there can be polarization of votes there

 Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan termed the claim of senior Congress leader and former Chief Minister Arjun Singh as 'beyond the truth' that the state plane had left the then Union Carbide President Warren Anderson without his knowledge
 arjuna singh dwaara rajyasabha main bhopal gas traasadee par die gaye bayaan par pratikriya vyakt karte hue mukhyamantri chouhan ne apane sarkari nivas par kaha, ‘‘mukhyamantri kii sahmati ke bina rajkeey vimaan kahin ja hi nahin saktaa
 The claim made by Singh (who was then Chief Minister) about this is not true ''
 unhone kaha ki vah swayan tab kii ‘log book’ dekh chuke hai, jisamen saat disambar 1984 ko 15:15 baje darj kiya gaya he
 'special Flight ordered by Chief Minister'
 is sandarbh main singh kaa rajyasabha main diya gaya bayaan andeh paidaa karata he, jisamen unhone kaha he ki rajkeey vimaan unki jaankaree ke bina anderson ko lekar dilli gaya tha
 On repeatedly asking him if Arjun Singh was lying, Chauhan said that 'he is not telling the truth'
 is bare main tathyon ko chipaaya ja rahaa he mukhyamantri ne kaha ki arjuna singh ne is vishay par bahut dinon baad chuppi todi or unhen (chouhan) bharosa tha ki sach ujagar hoga, lekin afsos aisa nahin hua he
 The question is also why Singh spoke so late
 sach to ek kshan main baahar aata he itane samay tak kya yah tay kiya ja rahaa tha ki kya bolnaa he
 Who to trap and who to save
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki singh kaa yah daawa bhi ‘gale utarane vaala nahin he’ ki giraftaar ke baad anderson ko reeha karne ke liye kendriya grih vibhaag kaa dabaav tha
 He was not only the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh at that time, but also a senior and highly diplomatic leader of the Congress
 un par yadi anderson kii rihaai ke liye grih mantralay kaa dabaav tha, to vah pradhanmantri athwa grahamantri se baat kar sakate the
 Chauhan said that it is also surprising for Singh to say that when he informed the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on an election tour in Harda of the state about Anderson's arrest and the whole incident, he said that 'let's go to the next meeting' He said that the self
 rajeev gandhi ek aisi ghatana par is tarah samvedan shunya nahin ho sakate, jisamen pandraa hajaar logon kii jaan chali gai or lakhon log prabhavit the
 Chauhan said that while Singh is proud of Anderson's arrest, he should be ashamed of his release
 yah unka vyaktigat maamla nahin he, sawaal hajaaron ke maare jane or paanch lakh se adhik logon ke prabhavit hone kaa he
 He said that it would be a matter of 'justice' for the gas victims that Arjun Singh should bring out the truth
 unhone doharaaya ki singh ne tathy chhipaane or kisi ko bachaane kaa prayaas kiya he
 It is noteworthy that in the criminal case of Bhopal gas tragedy, the then Chief Judicial Magistrate, Mohan P
 tiwari dwaara is varsh saat june ko union karbaide india limited ke tatkaaleen adhyaksh keshav mahendra sahit aath aropiyon ko do saal karawas evam ek lakh rupaye jurmaane kii sajaa sunai gai thi

 Those who have this protection will now also have SPG personnel stationed on foreign tours with them, that is, any person who has this facility will also travel with him
 pehle aisa nahin hota tha, lekin ab sarkaar niyam main badlaav kar rahi he
 This decision of the government is being linked to the visits of former Congress President Rahul Gandhi and other members of the Gandhi family
 aapako bataa den kisishfgh suraksha desh main pradhanmantri or purv pradhanmantriyon ko di jaati he
 Right now, apart from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Gandhi family gets this facility

 Questions have been raised many times by the Bharatiya Janata Party that Rahul Gandhi often goes on such foreign trips, which the country is not aware of
 jabaki vah vipakshi party ke bade netaa hai

 SPG suraksha main rahul gandhbhi tak kya hota tha?darasal, gandhi parivaar kii ore se jab bhi koi vyakti videsh daure par jaataa tha to vah apane pehle stoppage tak hi SPG kii suraksha ko le jaataa tha, lekin uske baad vah unhen waapas bhej dete
 During this time, privacy was cited by the Gandhi family and their journey is carried forward
 ab kya hoga?kendriya grih mantralay ke nae badlaavon ke mutabik ab SPG suraksha lene vaala koi bhi sadsy yadi videsh daure par hoga to SPG ke jawan hameshaa hi unke saath rahenge
 If this does not happen then there can be a risk of life
 yani ab dilli se videsh jane or waapas dilli aane tak SPG suraksha ke jawan gandhi parivaar ke saath rahenge
 The Prime Minister is always in the middle of this security circle
 pradhanmantri ko milti he SPG surakshakisi hoti he SPG suraksha?bataa den ki chaar stareey suraksha ke alaava special protection group (SPG) ek special suraksha vyavastha he jiske tahat desh ke vartmaan or purv pradhanmantriyon ke alaava unke kareebi parijanon ko yah suraksha di jaati he
 After the assassination of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, SPG was set up to provide security to the country's top post leaders and their families

 At the same time, keeping in mind the bjp's strategy, a message is being sent by the Congress to the mlas that the cabinet may be expanded soon
 "is bich mukhyamantri kamalnath ne kaha, "bhaajapa ke log pehle din se yah koshish kar rahe hai

 On the other hand, BJP leaders are in constant discussion with both BSP mlas
 nirdaleey vidhayak to khule taur par kai baar apni naaraazgi jaahir kar chuke hai
 In such a situation, with the return of the BJP government at the Center, the state unit feels that it will be easy to find the weak link of Congress during the assembly session
 sutara ke anusaar, congress kii ore se aane vaale dinon main mantrimandal vistaar karke in asantusht vidhayakon ko santusht kiya jayega

 The militants did him no harm and handed over to media persons in Kandhamal district from where he was abducted on 14 March
 kandhamal ke police adheekshak je en pankaj ne kaha, ‘hamen soochna mili he ki daringbadi ke paas tanjingiya kshetra main maovadiyon ne kolangelo ko mediakarmiyon ko saunp diya
 Now he is coming towards Daringbadi
 ’ grih sachiv you en behara ne kaha ki 61 varshiya kolangelo ne unhen phone kiya or rihaai ke tatkaal baad unase baatcheet kii
 He said, 'the cholangels told me that they have been released and their health is fine and they have not been harmed
 ’grih sachiv ne kaha ki ek anya italvi naagarik puri ke rahane vaale poulo basusco (54) ab bhi maovadiyon ke kabje main he
 After his release, Colangelo told media persons, "I would like to call my wife as soon as possible
 ’kolangelon ne kaha, ‘unhone hamaari utani acchhee tarah se dekhbhaal kii jitani kar sakate the
 i do not want to get into politics
 main ise peshewaron par chodta hum
 He said that he and Basusco were bathing in the river when four people came and took them hostage
 kolangelo ne kaha, ‘yah sangharsh he
 Today finally found a solution
 ummid karte hai poulo ko bhi jald hi reeha kar diya jayega
 'director General of Police Manmohan Prahraj said,' We received information that an Italian hostage has been released
 ’yah rihaai maovadiyon se baatcheet kar rahe madhyasthon bidi sharma tathaa dandpani mohanti ke oreisha ke vidhayak ke apharan ke baad madhyasthata chhodane tathaa iske baad maovadiyon or oreisha sarkaar ke bich baatcheet band hone ke baad hui he
 The Chief Minister appealed to the Maoists to release the Italian citizens
 rashtriya natya vidhyalay (enesdy) se kramash: 2006 or 2007 ke snaatak dampati rasika agashe (36 varsh) or mohammad jishaan ayyub (36 varsh) kaa jivan bhi ek kisse kii tarah he
 Rather say a slightly different life of looking for stories for the stage, going beyond small achievements
 diploma lekar jishaan ek acting skool main naukari ke liye dubai chale gaye lekin vahaan tamaam tarah kii sharten dekh dhai maheene main hi dilli laut aae
 While doing the same theater, he got an opportunity for the popular film No One Killed Jessica (2011)
 uske baad donon mumbai aa gaye
 His vigilance on socio-political issues was continuously motivating him to explore something new for the platform
 sirf manoranjan ke liye cinema or naatak karnaa vaise bhi unka kabhi makasad nahin rahaa tha
 And then in December 2012, the famous Nirbhaya incident of Delhi gave him a big opportunity to take the initiative
 unhone 2013 main beeing association naam se theatre group banaakar is disha main ek pahal kii
 Zeeshan also says, "we came not to become Mumbai actors but to do the work of our choice and we are doing the same
" '' unki bisek filmon main jiro, mere brother kii dulhan, tanu vaids manu or haal kii artical 15 bhi shaamil hai, jisamen unhone dalit activist chandrashekhar ravan se prerit kirdaar ko jiya he
 Since the original concern of the two was around the theater, Zeeshan earned some money from cinema and Rasika focused on plays on the same lines
 samakaleen muddon or chintaaon par kendrit taaja bimbon vaale naatak na milane par unhone nae natyalekh ke liye pratiyogita kii shakl main ek or pahal kii: samhita manch
 She says, "we were not getting the preferred script to do a new play
 yah sochakar hamane pratiyogita rakhi ki 4-5 script to mil jaaen
 See more! Found 80 scripts
 isse samaj main aayaa ki log likh rahe hai
 "this is a rare initiative to get new plays written at non-official level and then to stage selected scripts
" pratiyogita kaa yah teesraa saal tha or iske tahat ab tak kareeb 300 script aa chuki hai
 Rasika tells Babaki that reading the plays and sorting them out is so patient and challenging, that she had no idea at all
 is saal chune gaye chaar naatakon main se ek, karn ke jivan par aadhaarit radhey (natyalekhak: amit sharma) kaa nirdesan khud rasika ne kiya
 Zeeshan became its producer
 mumbai or dilli samet 4 shaharon main inke sho hue
 In the last six years, the script of 11 of his group's bisexual plays came out in this way
 theatre ve apane sukun ke liye karte hai lekin unhen pataa he ki iske boote kisi kaa ghar nahin chal saktaa
 Zeeshan admits that "if i got so much money in the theater, i would not go to the cinema
" '' rasika aage kii line bolti hai, ''kisi naatak ke manchan kii laagat badaae par mujhe pasinaa chhootane lagata he
 Then it gives great strength to Zeeshan to say, 'don't worry, just handle the drama
 '' or jab logon ko naatak pasand aa jaataa he to donon yah sochakar sukun kii saans lete hai ki ''sahi jagah par paise lage
 "the Being Association is now creating an e-library of new and old Hindi plays so that they are available for free to the theater organizations for staging or with some royalties
" asagar vajahat jaise kuch naatakakaron ne apni kritiyaan nishulk de di hai
 Some unpublished dramas of veteran dramatist Habib Tanveer have also been found
 30 naatak to aplod bhi ho gaye hai
 For both, it is a time to 'enjoy' their work
 rasika spasht karti hai, ''bhavishya ke bare main zyada sochane se ham abhi ke apane kaam ko enjoy karnaa band kar denge
 In the same vein, Zeeshan is busy shooting for a film by Hansal Mehta and in preparation for a play on Rasika Gandhi
 donon kii vyast raah ke bich jo ek nanha sethu jajbaati taur par unhen jodta or sabase zyada takat detaa he, uskaa naam he, paanch saal kii beti raahi
 The struggle does not believe the word
 The gang rape incident as a Nirbhaya scandal in Terning Point, Delhi, followed by the staging of the play Museum of Species in Danger by the duo, formed a theater group called Being Association
 Believe that the sources of success are uninterested in your work: Zeeshan's acting in films and Rasika's s buddy and staged their Karkapane the Menlokpriyta-confident attitude about your work *** rang de basanti film main mahaj kuch seconds ke role se shuruyaat karne vaale abhishek banerjee aaj industry main janaa pahachaanaa naam hai

 There has been criticism about the lack of edge in Indian bowling, but the extent was reached when the world number nine team also shed the sweat of the world champion bowlers
 bangladesh kii ballebaaji ke dauraan bhartiya gendbaajon ko dekhakar yah sochna lajimi tha ki srilanka or pakistan ke khilaaf inkaa kya haal hoga

 asia cap main bharat ke pehle match main alam yah rahaa ki bangladesh jaisi team ne 39wein over main hi 200 kaa aankada paar kar liya
 Taking advantage of the weak Indian bowling, the Bangladesh captain, who has played 125 odis, scored the second ODI century of his career

 5−0−74−1−9
 44) Run expenses, then India's No
1 spinner r Ashwin spent 50 runs in 10 overs and took just one wicket

 Mohammed Shami put Bangladesh on course, but in the last 10 overs Bangladesh added 71 runs and gave India a challenging target of 280 runs
 saaf he ki bhartiya gendbaajon kii haalat khasta he

 My entire focus was on the World Cup
 meraa sabase bada sapana vishwa cap jeetna tha or ek khilaadi ke liye isse badi santushti kuch nahin ho sakati
 That was the most important moment of my life

 ' pakistan ne hawaii kshetra par pratibandh 12 july tak badha diya he
 The statement issued by the Civil Aviation Authority said that it has been decided to extend the ban on Eastern airspace of Pakistan by 12 July
 yah pratibandh sabhi bhartiya commercial flite par lagu hoga
 This is the fourth time Pakistan has extended a period of airspace restrictions
 pakistan dwaara hawaii kshetra par pratibandh hataaya bhi ja saktaa tha, lekin iske ulat pakistan dwaara hawaii kshetra par pratibandh badhaane kaa faisla kiya gaya he
 Earlier also Pakistan extended the period of ban on airspace
 13 june ko pakistan ne hawaii kshetra par pratibandh badhaakar 28 june tak kar diya tha
 On 26 February, the air force was attacked by the Indian Air Force at the jaish-e-mohammed terrorist training camp in Balakot
 iske baad pakistan or bharat ne ek-duusare ke liye hawaii kshetron par pratibandh laga diya tha
 Pakistan lifted the ban on some of its airports, but not all airports

 brahmaputra kaa pani diawart karne ke liye 1000 kilo meter lambii tunnel banane kii yojana ke bare main khud china ne inkaar kar diya he
 China's foreign spokesperson Hua Chunying issued a statement, saying the report was false
 saath hi hua ne kaha ki china hameshaa se trans border jal sansaadhan main hameshaa madad karte rahaa he or aage bhi vah madad kaa mahatvapurn haath badhaate rahegaa
 Hua also said that China will continue to share the water of the Brihmaputra river with its neighbors in the future
 aapako bataa den ki report ain thi ki brahmaputra ko lekar china ne nayaa plan taiyaar kiya he
 Chinese engineers have prepared a plan to build a 1000 km long tunnel to divert water of the Brahmaputra
 is tunnel ke jariye brahmaputra kaa pani tibet se jinjiyang kii taraf modane kii yojana he
 However, this new claim from China has raised questions on the report and this news has come as a relief for India
 vahiin china kii taraf se 1000 kilometre lambii surang banaakar bramhaputra ke pani ko modane ke sawaal par kendriya grih rajyamantri kiren rigiju ne kaha ki koi report hogi, lekin aisa china kii sarkaar kii taraf se nahi kaha gaya he
 In such a situation, the Indian government also does not seem to support this report
 aapako bataa den ki doklam vivaad ke sulajhane ke baad sechinaur bharat donon kii taraf se dostana rishte kii pahal kii koshish hui he
 Many Chinese officials and President Xi Jinping himself have spoken of friendly relations with neighbors, especially India
 china kii is ghoshnaa ko bhi isi disha main ek pahal ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Let me tell you that India has also questioned many dams being built on the Brahmaputra river
 yah thi reporthankong ke akhbaar 'south china morning post' ne khabar di thi ki chini ejiniyaron ne brahmaputra kaa pani diawart karne ke liye 1000 kilo meter lambii tunnel banane kii yojana taiyaar kii he

 BJP has won a clear majority in the assembly by winning 12 of the 15 assembly seats
 isse yediurppa ne apni sarkaar ko alpamat se bahumat karne ke saath-saath party main bhi apane kad ko badhaayaa he
 Whereas, the cms of BJP ruled states have lost their seats in the by-elections instead of capturing the seats of other parties
 bies yediurppa ne karnataka kii 15 main se 12 siten jitkar na keval vidhansabha main paryaapt bahumat hasil kar liya, balki congress-jedies kaa safaya bhi kar diya
 Of these 15 seats, 12 were held by Congress and three with JDS, but in the by-elections where Congress got only two seats, the account of JDS could not be opened
 ek seat nirdaleey ummidavaar ke khate main gai
 In this uncomfortable situation, Congress state president Dinesh Gundurao and leader of opposition Siddaramaiah have sent their resignations to the party's national president Sonia Gandhi

 In this context, these by-elections meant special significance for the BJP
 bijepi ke paas vidhansabha main ek nirdaleey samet 105 vidhayak the
 In such a situation, after the by-elections, 7 more mlas were needed for the majority in the changed mathematics in the assembly
 jabaki, congress or jedies ko bharosa tha ki ayogy tehraane ke baad bijepi se chunaav lard rahe pratyaashiyon ko janata nakaar degi
 But this did not happen and the BJP won 12 seats instead of six
 upachunaavon ke baad karnataka kii 224 sadasyeey vidhansabha main bijepi ke paas 117 vidhayak ho gaye hai
 With this, the future of the four-month-old Yeddyurappa government has been secured

 congress adhyaksharahul gandhiore upie cheirpersansonia gandhiko iskar vibhaag ke notice maamle main dilli hoicourt ne raahat dene se inkaar kar diya he
 a division bench of Justices s Ravindra Bhatt and Justice AK Chawla dismissed the appeals of Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and Oscar Fernandes
 hoicourt ke is aadesh ke baad rahul gandhi, sonia gandhi or auskar furnandis ke paas do raste hai, yaa to hoicourt ke aadesh par ab ye iskar vibhaag ke saamne pesh hon or apni daleelein va tathy rakhen yaa phir doosraa rasta supreme court jaataa he jahaan dilli hycourt ke is aadesh ko chunauti den
 BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra, while welcoming the High Court's decision in the matter, said that this is a victory of zero tolerance over corruption of Modi government
 unhone kaha kicongressdvara bulaae gaye bharat band kii asli vajah yahi thi
 Because they knew that the High Court's decision was going to come against them
 bharat band konational heraldces se jodne par congress pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne palatwaar karte hue kaha ki band kii safalataa se modi sarkaar ghabara gai he, isliye sarkaar badale kii bhaavana se kaam kar rahi he
 Surjewala said that the National Herald will not stop printing the government's jagged fears
 gauratlab he ki yah maamla 2011-12 kaa he, jab rahul gandhi, sonia gandhi or auskar furnandis ne apane iskar ritern file kar die the
 But in 2018, a notice was received by the Income Tax Department to re-examine the file of this return
 vibhaag kii daleel he ki in teenon ne neshnal herald ke navajivan trust ke haathon tech over kaa zikr apane ritern main kahin nahin kiya ki wo aamad kahaan he?iskar vibhaag ke isi notice ko rahul gandhi, sonia gandhi or auskar furnandis kii taraf se chunauti di gai thi
 He argued that Navjivan is a charitable trust, which is based on no profit no loss, so what is income
 isliye iskaa zikr karnaa jaruri nahin tha
 But the Income Tax Department is not looking at this transaction from this perspective
 teenon ne ye daleel bhi di ki chah saal tak iskar vibhaag ne koi sud nahin lee or chah saal kii antim seemaa puri hone se ek din pehle notice bheja
 There are many process related flaws in that too
 court ne saaf kah diya ki yah daleelein to ab iskar adhikariyon ke saamne hi chalengi

 To realize Balasaheb's dream, Uddhav Thackeray broke his 25-year-old friendship with the BJP and joined hands with his rival ncp-congress
 shivasena shanivaar ko sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karti, lekin usase pehle hi sharad pavaar ke bhattije ajit pavaar ne ensipi ko todakar balasaheb ke sapane ko chakanachur kar diya

 It has increased the toll tax on the movement of all vehicles in toll tax naco across the country
 wo bhi paanch rupee tak
 Whereas most of the national highways have turned into big pits
 unamem sadak hai yaa gadde samaj main nahin aata
 Highway repair is also not timely
 iske baavjood toll tex riviz karne ke naam par neshnal hive athurity ne toll thekedaaron ko maalamaal karne kaa notification jari kar diya he
 From October 15, an increase in the duty on all types of vehicles has been implemented in all the toll tax nacos of the country
 dilachasp baat yah he ki chillar kii samasya ko dhyaan main rakh kar round figure main kai hive main shulk kam kiya janaa tha
 But that too was increased
 desh kaa ek bhi hive aisa nahin he, jahaan toll tex riviz ke chalate vaahanon ko tex adaayagi main raahat di gai ho
 Increased duty has also been imposed on the block of Chhattisgarh's largest fort Bypass Expressway
 yahaan saat toll naake hai
 Every vehicle has to pay more than 3 to 5 rupees as toll fee
 durg bypass aisa toll naakaa he jahaan bike savaaron se prayek pheraa 13 rupee tex liya jaataa he
 It has now been increased to 15 rupees
 udhaaharan ke taur par yadi kisi vahaan kaa vartmaan toll 157 rupee kar die hai to use badhaakar 160 rupee kar diya gaya
 If the charge is 51 rupees, it should have been raised to 50 rupees, but it has been increased to 55 rupees
 jaankaron ke mutabik zyaadaatar maamalon main toll vasuulanevaali company ne shulk badhaayaa hi he
 Whereas NHI officers claim that the rate has to be revised in such a way that it is reduced even further
 neshnal hive ne toll nako kaa sanchaalan kar rahi companiyon ko adhikrut kar diya he ki wo overlod vaahanon se 10 guna tak shulk vasuul sakate hai
 After this instruction, machines are being installed to weigh vehicles not only in Chhattisgarh, but also in the rest of the toll naco
 jaankaron ke mutabik neshnal hive othority ne bilaspur hoicourt ke ek aadesh ko centre main rakhkar yah faisla liya he
 Significantly, the companies charging the toll by constructing the road had filed a petition in the court that the roads are deteriorating quickly due to overload vehicles
 or unki marammat kaa kharch bhi bad rahaa he
 The National Highway Authority has revised the toll tax across the country citing the reason for devaluation of small currency
 nae niyam ke tahat desh ke sabhi toll nako main varsh 2030 tak nae riviz system se hi shulk liya jaayegaa
 However, opposition has also started

 According to him, the National Highway should first fix its roads, provide facilities and then revise the toll tax
 aapako ye jaanakar hairaani hogi ki jahaan akele desh kii rajdhani dilli main sibar krime ke das hajaar maamle ek din main ho rahe hai vahaan centre sarkaar ne sibar krime ke liye gathit kii gai sibar tribunel ko hi band kar diya he
 It is also sad that due to the absence of the chairman for the last seven years, not a single case could be heard in this tribunal since 2011
 soochna prodhogiki ke is yug main jahaan sibar krime lagaataar bad rahaa he or aap or ham main se smart mobile kaa istemaal karne vaala har vyakti iskaa aasaan shikaar he, vahaan par sarkaar ne 2006 main banaai gai sibar apillet tribunel ko khatm kar diya he
 Not having been the chairman since 2011 in this tribunal, not a single case related to cybercrime could be heard
 yani agarbank accountse achaanak aapke lakhon rupee nikal jaaen yaa phir computer se kisi ne aapaki personal jaankaree chura lee ho, yaa aapkaa computer kisi ne hack kar liya ho to unki sunwaayee or apradhi ko sajaa dilwane ke liye aap kuch nahin kar paaenge

 We did a survey a few years ago about how under-reporting happens in India, in cybercrime cases, we found that only 50 out of 500 complaints are received and then firs are filed in only 1 out of 50 cases
 
 philhal sarkaar ne tidi set yani Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal main sibar tribunel or airport tribunel kaa vilay kar diya he, lekin ye sirf rasm adaayagi bhar he kyonki tidi set ke paas pehle se hi dedh hajaar maamle pending hai or maamle sunne ke liye sirf ek bench he
 There is no cyber expert in the bench and no judicial member of the judicial bench, hence no cybercrime petition is put here, because it is not possible to hear the cases related to Benaiser Fraudse without another bench
 supreme court se ritred justise shiva kirti singh tidi set ke chairman hai
 He himself also believes that there are already many cases pending, so until a new bench is formed, cyber or airport tribunal, the cases cannot be settled soon
 lihaaja unhone sarkaar ko likh bhi diya he ki ek or nai bench tribunel main banaai jaae
 Justice Siva Kirti Singh, chairman of TD set, says that there are already too many cases pending, so there is a need to create a new bench and we have written to the government about this
 philhal tidi set ke paas apana daftar tak nahin he
 It is being run from Delhi's five-star Samrat Hotel, whose annual rent is only about Rs 10 crore
 kai saal se audit main is baat par hi sawaal khadaa kiya gaya he ki aakhir hotel se tribunel ko kyon chalaaya ja rahaa he
 The government, which spent crores in the tribunal, is still unable to give the option of cybercrime victims to register their cases and this is when Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to convert India into a Digital India

 Major decisions have been taken on GST
 sarkaar ne samasyaon ko sangyaan lete hue kai kadam uthaae hai
 But we will first talk about our series which has been running for the last three days with the vacant post of teachers in universities
 aakhir hamaare vishvavidhyalay chal kaise rahe hai, jab vahaan professor lekturer nahin hai to chaatro ne padhaa kya
 The group of students and teachers is also in lakhs, yet why this group did not create enough pressure that there are no teachers in the class
 agar banaaya to sarkaar ne kyon nahin suna
 Higher education was dying before your eyes, how did you tolerate it
 kya ham bilkul nahin chaahate ki hamaare aas paas hi college achche hon, shiksha sasti ho or acchhee ho taaki ladke ladakiyon ko baahar padhane ke liye bhejnaa na pade or parivaar par karche kaa boj na bade
 We will talk about Patna University
 1 oktober 1917 ko yah vishvavidhyalay kaayam hua tha
 This year and this month turns a hundred years old
 14 oktober ko pradhanmantri patna ja rahe hai
 Our question is simple
 kya pradhanmantri ko bataaya gaya he ki itihaas ke alaava patna uniwarsity kaa vartmaan kaisaa he
 Have they been told by Human Resources Minister Prakash Javadekar that there is only one professor in the department of many colleges and none in any
 agar prakaash jaavdekar vyast hai to kya isi vishvavidlaay ke chaatr rahe maanav sansaadhan rajya mantri upendra kushvaha ne pradhanmantri ne jaankaree di he? kya mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne pradhanmantri ko jaankaree di he ki vahaan shikshak to nahin hai, imaarat he jo sau saal kii ho gai he, ham usee kaa jashn manaa rahe hai? The Prime Minister is coming, so the walls are being painted by uprooting the Patna University
 vaise yahaan jahaan saaf kiya ja rahaa he shaayad hi pradhanmantri ko jhaank kar dekhne kaa mauka mili lekin ankhon main dhul jhonkne kaa sarkari tarika na to janata ko chodta he na hi apane pradhan ko bakhshata he
 After his arrival, the citizens will also remember for a few days that the WOW program took place, the university was brightened on arrival
 pradhanmantri ji, yah sab aapke sammaan main nahin, aapako asaliyat na pataa chale, isliye kiya ja rahaa he
 a hundred years of history will be ready by wearing a new pants shirt on October 14, but you will go there and ask about the present of Patna University
 1917 aadhunik bharat or aadhunik bihar kaa itihaas kaa mahatvapurn saal tha, jab yahaan champaran satyagrah hua or uske kuch maheene baad patna uniwarsity kii neenv padi
 It has been more than nine hundred years since the University of Oxford, continues to this day and students still dream of going there
 magar bihar kaa yah oxford dam tod gaya
 Allahabad University also used to call itself the Oxford of the East, its condition has become like an old guide book
 uski bhi haalat patna uniwarsity kii tarah he
 Patna University is built on the banks of the Ganges
 duniya main bahut kam uniwarsity hogi jo nadi ke kinare bani hogi, jisaki class se ganga bahati dikhti thi
 The rooms of BN College used to be named the River View Room, no university will ever have more than some lecture theater of Science College
 ham sab science college dekhne jate the ki physics ke mahaan professor ech si verma kaise class lete hai
 Their class has its magic
 dhire-dhire patna uniwarsity khandhar main badalata gaya, or kisi ne nai eent jodne kii koshish nahin kii
 Professors of chemistry and mathematics were worshiped like heroes throughout the city and state
 bihar kaa sapana tha patna uniwarsity jis sapane ko sabane milakar maar diya
 Many universities of India had the desire to be called Oxford, but no one could touch her Meyer
 hamaari uniwarsity dekhne main hi kuubasurat rah gai hai
 Patna University is really beautiful
 magar aaj isaki bhoomika kya he, kya isliye iskaa shatabdi varsh manaaya ja rahaa he taaki pradhanmantri ko bulaanaa he? ham nahin jaanate hai ki patna uniwarsity ke vaais chancelar kaise hai, unhone is uniwarsity ke liye kya kiya he, magar jo record dikh rahaa he usase yahi lagata he ki isaki haalat bahut buree he
 People who have passed from this university are famous all over the world today
 bharat sarkaar ke grih sachiv rajeev gauva bhi patna uniwarsity ke chaatr rahe hai
 He used to be famous in terms of studies
 gujarat ke mukhya sachiv dow
 JN Singh has also been a student of Patna University
 maheenaa bhar pehle ritair hue baari udyog ke sachiv girish shankar bhi yaheen ke chaatr rahe hai
 Health Minister JP Nadda, Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad have also been students here
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or up mukhyamantri susheel modi bhi patna uniwarsity ke chaatr hai
 Ram Vilas Paswan has also been a student of Patna University
 purv rail mantri or bihar ke purv mukhyamantri lalu yadav bhi yaheen ke chaatr rahe hai
 Count as much as IAS, IPS, Chief Minister to Union Minister, Patna University has given a lot
 magar in sabase zyaada patna uniwarsity apane shikshakon ke kaaran yaadgaar rahaa he
 Historians here changed the direction of writing and teaching history
 ganit ke mastaron main professor lalji prasad kii kitabon kii kitni dhooma hua karti thi
 a university that does not have a teacher to teach in many classes, some courses have been closed due to lack of teachers, does the university spend even a rupee in the name of celebrating the centenary year of a poor country like India and a poor state like Bihar should do? Fifty lakh-crore rupees will be spent on his reception, not only is it worth every second of the Prime Minister of the country, after all what Patna University will present to him
 ham kyon patna uniwarsity kaa shatabdi varsh manaa rahe hai? BK Mishra is the department chairman of the Juology Department of Patna University
 kabhi yahaan 24 se 26 professor hua karte the magar ab yah sirf 4 shikshakon ke dam par chal rahaa he
 Once Patna University used to be a part of the Department of Zoology in India and the world
 jio chemistry kaa vibhaag to kaaphi femes tha magar ab is vishay ko padhaane vaala koi professor hi nahin lihaaza band kar diya gaya he
 a professor has to teach many papers
 professor na hone ke kaaran research kaa kaam thapp ho gaya he
 Restoration was not done after 2003, some posts have been advertised but very few and that too is very slow
 neeli kameez main pi ke sinha jeeyololical survey of india se ritair hue hai, jo apane kharche par aakar padhaa jate hai
 Only such teachers should meet the Prime Minister coming for the centenary year
 jo uniwarsity khandhar ho chuki he, uske bheetar ye shikshak aatma kii tarah abhi bhi bache hue hai
 Prof
 BK Mishra said that in the sixties, when there were no ten thousand students in Patna University, then there were more than a thousand posts for teachers
 aaj jab yahaan ke chaatro kii sankhya bees hazaar ke kareeb pahunch gai he to shikshakon kii manzur padon kii sankhya bhi kam kar di gai he or usamen se bhi aadhe se zyaada khaali hai
 Teachers like Prof
 Mishra somehow take a class
 padhaa hi dete hai
 Some teachers say that considering the number of students in Patna University, there should be 2000 teachers, but 420 post khaali hai, 320 prophessoron ke dam par uniwarsity chal rahi he
 More posts are empty than what you are teaching
 is baar 150 padon kaa hi vigyaapan niklaa he, jo kaaphi nahin
 Even after the restoration of 150, 170 posts will remain vacant
 patna uniwarsity ke kai college main kai vibhaag aise hai jo ek ek profasaron ke bharose chal rahe hai
 The condition of Patna University started deteriorating from the 1980s
 jatvaad or gundgardee ne ise barbaad kiya or phir yah uniwarsity kabhi sanbhal nahin saki
 It has not been saved even in the last fifteen years
 is dauraan bihar se lakhon kii sankhya main chaatr dilli aakar padhane ke liye majaboor hue
 His parents taught him by selling land and applying hard work capital
 bhaavnaatmak or aarthik nuksaan hua
 Everyone used to study in Patna Science College here, the top students of Bihar used to study, now the top who does it comes to Delhi University, not the Science College
 science college ke bare main hamane jo jaankaree jutai he, aap bhi padhie
 If Bihar could not save Patna Science College, then what is left with it
 patna science college main 112 pad manzur hai
 But this college is running on the strength of only 28 professors
 jeev vigyaan 2, ganit main 3 or banaspati vigyaan main 6 hi shikshak hai
 There are only 1 teacher in English and two in Hindi
 aakhir ham ek rajya main kam se kam do hi uniwarsity dhang se kyon nahin chalaa pate hai
 Look at the state of any state, it is not worth mentioning
 kya padon ko isliye khaali rakhaa gaya taaki piechdi karne ke baad bhi kisi ko naukari na mili
 Seeing the number of these vacant posts, it seems that the dream of becoming a teacher of many youngsters has been crushed
 das das saal shikshakon ne edaha padhaakar apni jindagi tabah kar daali magar post hote hue bhi nahin bhare gaye
 If there is no filling then why is phd being done, for whom does UGC take the examination of NET
 patna lau college main 14 teacher ke pad hai magar 9 pad khaali hai
 Patna Law College is running on the strength of only 5 professors
 hindi vibhaag main 34 pad hai lekin 11 professor hi padhaa rahe hai
 Patna College has two and a half thousand students and only 30 teachers to teach
 patna college ke hindi vibhaag main 6 kii jagah 2 hi padhaa rahe hai
 Here in the history department, instead of 6, only one professor is teaching
 patna uniwarsity ke itihaas vibhaag kaa to haal or bhi bura he
 Ten years ago there used to be 25 professors, now there are only 6
 itihaas kaa bedaa gark isiilie ho rahaa he
 People are studying History in whatsapp University instead of Classroom
 magadh mahila college main kabhi 100 professor the, aaj 32 professor hai
 Five thousand girls study at Magadh Mahila College
 kya 32 professor paanch hazaar chaatraon ko padhaa sakate hai? hindi, itihaas or jeev vigyaan main padhaane ke liye ek ek professor hai
 There should be at least five five professors in these three departments
 aap soch rahe honge ki main kora aankada pard rahaa hum jiskaa kya matlab he
 We also never thought that this would be the condition of Patna University
 ek samay aisa bhi tha ki yahaan ke chaatr teen saal kaa bie chah saal main karte the, railgadee let hoti thi, magar yahaan to seshan hi let ho jaataa tha
 Thankfully, Seshal is not late
 pradhanmantri kaa daura hone vaala he isliye hamane jinase bhi baat kii, kisi karrwai kii ashanka main koi camere par nahin aayaa
 Students of Bihar know, cut it till matriculation here and then go to Delhi
 aap yaad kiijie, pichley das saal se bihar main padhai kii kamyaabi ke kisse koching sansthaanon se nikalate hai, uniwarsity se nahin
 If Bihar does not have a university, what is there to show the world and stop the migration of students
 bahut si sarkarein raheen magar koi ek uniwarsity na khadaa kar saki
 How will Patna University face the Prime Minister of India on October 14 or how will the Prime Minister face it? We have known the condition of many universities of the country
 yahi samaj aayaa ki paise waalon ne apane bacchon ko padhaane kaa kahin or intazaam kar liya he
 Arrangements have been made to ensure that the children of poor and ordinary people are unable to read so that they will remain where their ancestors lived for generations
 bade logon ko fark nahin padaa ki patna uniwarsity kii haalat kharaab he kyonki unke bacchon ne paise se duusari uniwarsity chun lee, rah gaye aam log to unhen khaali class rup main sapana dekhne ke liye bitha diya gaya
 One question is from you whether you are able to see what the condition of your children is going to be
 ek chota sa sawaal he, aap ye sab dekh kaise paa rahe hai
 The comments ek choti si jaankaree or
 SL College is a college in Sitamarhi
 paanch hazaar chaatr padhate hai, teacher maatr 5 hai
 a teacher must be teaching a thousand students there
 agar aap bihar ke hai to dil par haath rakhkar kahie ki kya aap dilli uniwarsity chhod kar apane bachche kaa admician patna uniwarsity main karana chahenge, yah jaanate hue ki vahaan teacher nahin hai
 At times, it seems that the Prime Minister should change his intention to enter the centenary year
 hamaari koshish yahi thi ki pradhanmantri tak yah jaankaree pahunche varanaa unke bhaashan main keval gauravgaan hi hoga, vartmaan nahin hoga
 They will fall prey to misinformation
 unhen apane bhaashan main khaali class room, khaali shikshakon kii baat kerani chahie
 The Chief Minister and the Deputy Chief Minister should ask why the condition of Patna University is such that even when both are students there, and is an hour away from their office
 vaise pradhanmantri ko ek chakkar patna kaa bhi laga lenaa chahie, unhen pataa chalegaa ki shahar main swatchta kii haalat kitni kharaab he

 ganit ke mastaron main professor lalji prasad kii kitabon kii kitni dhooma hua karti thi
 a university that does not have a teacher to teach in many classes, some courses have been closed due to lack of teachers, does the university spend even a rupee in the name of celebrating the centenary year of a poor country like India and a poor state like Bihar should do? Fifty lakh-crore rupees will be spent on his reception, not only is it worth every second of the Prime Minister of the country, after all what Patna University will present to him
 ham kyon patna uniwarsity kaa shatabdi varsh manaa rahe hai? BK Mishra is the department chairman of the Juology Department of Patna University
 kabhi yahaan 24 se 26 professor hua karte the magar ab yah sirf 4 shikshakon ke dam par chal rahaa he
 Once Patna University used to be a part of the Department of Zoology in India and the world
 jio chemistry kaa vibhaag to kaaphi femes tha magar ab is vishay ko padhaane vaala koi professor hi nahin lihaaza band kar diya gaya he
 a professor has to teach many papers
 professor na hone ke kaaran research kaa kaam thapp ho gaya he
 Restoration was not done after 2003, some posts have been advertised but very few and that too is very slow
 neeli kameez main pi ke sinha jeeyololical survey of india se ritair hue hai, jo apane kharche par aakar padhaa jate hai
 Only such teachers should meet the Prime Minister coming for the centenary year
 jo uniwarsity khandhar ho chuki he, uske bheetar ye shikshak aatma kii tarah abhi bhi bache hue hai
 Prof
 BK Mishra said that in the sixties, when there were no ten thousand students in Patna University, then there were more than a thousand posts for teachers
 aaj jab yahaan ke chaatro kii sankhya bees hazaar ke kareeb pahunch gai he to shikshakon kii manzur padon kii sankhya bhi kam kar di gai he or usamen se bhi aadhe se zyaada khaali hai
 Teachers like Prof
 Mishra somehow take a class
 padhaa hi dete hai
 Some teachers say that considering the number of students in Patna University, there should be 2000 teachers, but 420 post khaali hai, 320 prophessoron ke dam par uniwarsity chal rahi he
 More posts are empty than what you are teaching
 is baar 150 padon kaa hi vigyaapan niklaa he, jo kaaphi nahin
 Even after the restoration of 150, 170 posts will remain vacant
 patna uniwarsity ke kai college main kai vibhaag aise hai jo ek ek profasaron ke bharose chal rahe hai
 The condition of Patna University started deteriorating from the 1980s
 jatvaad or gundgardee ne ise barbaad kiya or phir yah uniwarsity kabhi sanbhal nahin saki
 It has not been saved even in the last fifteen years
 is dauraan bihar se lakhon kii sankhya main chaatr dilli aakar padhane ke liye majaboor hue

 Everyone used to study in Patna Science College here, the top students of Bihar used to study, now the top who does it comes to Delhi University, not the Science College
 science college ke bare main hamane jo jaankaree jutai he, aap bhi padhie
 If Bihar could not save Patna Science College, then what is left with it
 patna science college main 112 pad manzur hai
 But this college is running on the strength of only 28 professors
 jeev vigyaan 2, ganit main 3 or banaspati vigyaan main 6 hi shikshak hai
 There are only 1 teacher in English and two in Hindi
 aakhir ham ek rajya main kam se kam do hi uniwarsity dhang se kyon nahin chalaa pate hai
 Look at the state of any state, it is not worth mentioning
 kya padon ko isliye khaali rakhaa gaya taaki piechdi karne ke baad bhi kisi ko naukari na mili
 Seeing the number of these vacant posts, it seems that the dream of becoming a teacher of many youngsters has been crushed
 das das saal shikshakon ne edaha padhaakar apni jindagi tabah kar daali magar post hote hue bhi nahin bhare gaye
 If there is no filling then why is phd being done, for whom does UGC take the examination of NET
 patna lau college main 14 teacher ke pad hai magar 9 pad khaali hai
 Patna Law College is running on the strength of only 5 professors
 hindi vibhaag main 34 pad hai lekin 11 professor hi padhaa rahe hai
 Patna College has two and a half thousand students and only 30 teachers to teach
 patna college ke hindi vibhaag main 6 kii jagah 2 hi padhaa rahe hai
 Here in the history department, instead of 6, only one professor is teaching
 patna uniwarsity ke itihaas vibhaag kaa to haal or bhi bura he
 Ten years ago there used to be 25 professors, now there are only 6
 itihaas kaa bedaa gark isiilie ho rahaa he
 People are studying History in whatsapp University instead of Classroom
 magadh mahila college main kabhi 100 professor the, aaj 32 professor hai
 Five thousand girls study at Magadh Mahila College
 kya 32 professor paanch hazaar chaatraon ko padhaa sakate hai? hindi, itihaas or jeev vigyaan main padhaane ke liye ek ek professor hai
 There should be at least five five professors in these three departments
 aap soch rahe honge ki main kora aankada pard rahaa hum jiskaa kya matlab he
 We also never thought that this would be the condition of Patna University
 ek samay aisa bhi tha ki yahaan ke chaatr teen saal kaa bie chah saal main karte the, railgadee let hoti thi, magar yahaan to seshan hi let ho jaataa tha
 Thankfully, Seshal is not late
 pradhanmantri kaa daura hone vaala he isliye hamane jinase bhi baat kii, kisi karrwai kii ashanka main koi camere par nahin aayaa
 Students of Bihar know, cut it till matriculation here and then go to Delhi
 aap yaad kiijie, pichley das saal se bihar main padhai kii kamyaabi ke kisse koching sansthaanon se nikalate hai, uniwarsity se nahin
 If Bihar does not have a university, what is there to show the world and stop the migration of students
 bahut si sarkarein raheen magar koi ek uniwarsity na khadaa kar saki
 How will Patna University face the Prime Minister of India on October 14 or how will the Prime Minister face it? We have known the condition of many universities of the country
 yahi samaj aayaa ki paise waalon ne apane bacchon ko padhaane kaa kahin or intazaam kar liya he
 Arrangements have been made to ensure that the children of poor and ordinary people are unable to read so that they will remain where their ancestors lived for generations
 bade logon ko fark nahin padaa ki patna uniwarsity kii haalat kharaab he kyonki unke bacchon ne paise se duusari uniwarsity chun lee, rah gaye aam log to unhen khaali class rup main sapana dekhne ke liye bitha diya gaya
 One question is from you whether you are able to see what the condition of your children is going to be
 ek chota sa sawaal he, aap ye sab dekh kaise paa rahe hai
 The comments ek choti si jaankaree or
 SL College is a college in Sitamarhi
 paanch hazaar chaatr padhate hai, teacher maatr 5 hai
 a teacher must be teaching a thousand students there
 agar aap bihar ke hai to dil par haath rakhkar kahie ki kya aap dilli uniwarsity chhod kar apane bachche kaa admician patna uniwarsity main karana chahenge, yah jaanate hue ki vahaan teacher nahin hai
 At times, it seems that the Prime Minister should change his intention to enter the centenary year
 hamaari koshish yahi thi ki pradhanmantri tak yah jaankaree pahunche varanaa unke bhaashan main keval gauravgaan hi hoga, vartmaan nahin hoga
 They will fall prey to misinformation
 unhen apane bhaashan main khaali class room, khaali shikshakon kii baat kerani chahie
 The Chief Minister and the Deputy Chief Minister should ask why the condition of Patna University is such that even when both are students there, and is an hour away from their office
 vaise pradhanmantri ko ek chakkar patna kaa bhi laga lenaa chahie, unhen pataa chalegaa ki shahar main swatchta kii haalat kitni kharaab he
 They sit in a secret car and go to any street, dirt will be found
 iees, ipies, mukhyamantri se lekar kendriya mantri tak jitna man utana gin lijie, patna uniwarsity ne bahut kuch diya he
 But most of all Patna University has been memorable because of its teachers
 yahaan ke itihaaskaaron ne itihaas lekhan or padhaane kii disha badal di
 Professor Lalji Prasad's books were so popular among mathematics masters
 jis uniwarsity main kai class main padhaane ke liye shikshak na ho, shikshakon kii kami ke kaaran kuch course band kar die gaye hon, kya us vishvavidlaay ko bharat jaise garib desh or bihar jaise garib rajya ko shatabdi varsh manaane ke naam par ek rupaya bhi kharch karnaa chahie? unke swaagat par pachaas lakh-karod rupaya to karch hoga hi, yahi nahin desh ke pradhanmantri kaa ek ek second keemtee hota he, aakhir patna uniwarsity unke saamne apni kya report pesh karegi
 Why are we celebrating the centenary year of Patna University? patna uniwarsity ke juolji department ke vibhaag adhyaksh bi ke mishra hai
 Once there used to be 24 to 26 professors, but now it is running on the strength of only 4 teachers
 kabhi patna uniwarsity juolji vibhaag kii bharat or duniya main dhooma hua karti thi
 The department of GO Chemistry was quite popular but now no professor teaching this subject has been closed
 ek professor ko kai kai paper padhaane padate hai
 Research work has come to a standstill due to not being a professor
 2003 ke baad bahaali nahin hui thi, kuch padon kaa vigyaapan to niklaa he magar bahut kam or wo bhi bahaali kii raftaar kaaphi dhimi he
 In a blue shirt, PK Sinha has retired from the Geological Survey of India, which is read at his expense
 aise shikshakon ko hi shatabdi varsh ke liye aa rahe pradhanmantri se milaanaa chahie
 Within the university which has been ruined, these teachers still remain like a soul
 pro bi ke mishra ne andaaz se bataaya ki saath ke dashak main kabhi patna uniwarsity main jab das hazaar chaatr nahin hua karte the tab yahaan shikshakon ke liye hajaar se adhik pad manzur the
 Today when the number of students here has reached close to twenty thousand, the number of sanctioned posts of teachers has also been reduced and more than half of them are vacant
 pro mishra jaise shikshak kisi tarah class le lete hai
 They read it
 kuch shikshakon kaa kahana he ki patna uniwarsity main chaatro kii sankhya ko dekhte hue 2000 shikshak hone chahie, magar 420 posts are vacant, the university is running on the strength of 320 professors
 jitne padhaa rahe hai usase to zyaada post khaali hai
 This time only 150 posts have been advertised, which is not enough
 150 kii bahaali ke baad bhi 170 pad khaali hi rahenge
 There are many departments in many colleges of Patna University which are running on the trust of each one of the professors
 1980 ke dashak se hi patna uniwarsity kii haalat karaab hone lagi
 Casteism and hooliganism ruined it and then this university was never managed
 pichley pandrah saal main bhi iskaa uddhaar nahin hua
 During this period, lakhs of students from Bihar were forced to come to Delhi and study
 unke maa baap ne zamin bechakar or mehnat kii puunji lagaakar unhen padhaayaa
 There was emotional and financial loss
 yahaan ke patna science college main padhanaa sabakaa sapana hota tha, bihar ke top chaatr padhate the, ab jo top karata he wo science college nahin dilli uniwarsity aata he
 You have also read the information we have collected about the Science College
 agar bihar patna science college nahin bachaa sakaa, to uske paas bachaa hi kya he
 There are 112 posts approved in Patna Science College
 magar yah college maatr 28 profasaron ke bharose chal rahaa he
 There are only 2 teachers in Biology 2, Mathematics 3 and Banaspati Science
 angrezi main 1 or hindi main do hi shikshak hai
 After all, why are we not able to run at least two Universities in a State
 kisi bhi rajya kaa haal dekhie, bataane laayak nahin he
 Are the posts kept vacant so that no one gets a job even after doing phd
 in khaali padon kii sankhya dekhakar lagata he ki na jane kitne naujavaanon ke shikshak banane ke sapane ko kuchlaa gaya he
 Ten years, teachers ruined their lives by teaching Adhak, but were not filled even after posting
 agar bharna nahin he to phir piechdi kyon ho rahi he, ujisi net kaa imtahaan kiske liye letaa he
 Patna Law College has 14 teacher posts but 9 posts are vacant
 patna lau kalege sirf 5 prophessoron ke dam par chal rahaa he
 There are 34 posts in the Hindi department but only 11 professors are teaching
 patna college main dhai hazaar chaatr hai or padhaane ke liye maatr 30 shikshak hai
 In Patna College's Hindi Department, only 2 are teaching instead of 6
 yahaan ke itihaas vibhaag main 6 kii jagah ek hi professor padhaa rahe hai
 The history of Patna University's history department is even worse
 das saal pehle yahaan 25 professor hua karte the, ab sirf 6 hai
 This is why the fleet of history is going on
 log classroom kii jagah whatsap uniwarsity main itihaas kii padhai pard rahe hai
 Magadh Mahila College once had 100 professors, today there are 32 professors
 magadh mahila college main paanch hazaar ladkiyaan padhati hai
 Can 32 professors teach 5000 students? There is a professor to teach in Hindi, history and biology
 in teenon vibhaag main kam se kam paanch paanch professor hone chahie the
 You might be wondering what i mean by reading the blank figure
 hamane bhi kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki patna uniwarsity kii ye haalat hogi
 There was also a time that the students here used to do three years of BA in six years, the train used to be late, but here the session was late
 ganimat he ki seshal let nahin he
 The Prime Minister is about to visit, so whoever we talked to, nobody came on camera in anticipation of any action
 bihar ke chaatro ko pataa he, kisi tarah metric tak yahaan kaato phir dilli chalo
 You remember, for the last ten years, the stories of the success of studies in Bihar come from coaching institutes and not from the university
 agar bihar ke paas ek uniwarsity nahin he, duniya ko dikhaane or chaatro ke palaayan ko rokane ke liye to phir kya he
 There were many governments, but no one could set up a university
 14 oktober ko patna uniwarsity aakhir bharat ke pradhanmantri kaa saamana kaise karegaa yaa pradhanmantri kis tarah se uskaa saamana karenge? hamane desh ke kai vishvavidlaayon kaa haal janaa he
 It was understood that the money-makers had made arrangements to teach their children elsewhere
 jo garib or saadhaaran log hai unke bachche na pard paaen iskaa intazaam kar diya gaya he taaki ve pidiyon tak vahiin rahen jahaan unke purakhe the
 The big people did not mind that the condition of Patna University is bad because their children chose another university with the money, the common people were left to dream as empty class
 ek sawaal aapse he ki kya aap yah dekh paa rahe hai ki aapke bacchon kaa bhavishya jahaan bananaa he, vahaan kii haalat kya he
 There is a small question, how are you able to see all this
 tippaniyan a little information and
 sitamarhi kaa ek college he es el ke college
 Five thousand students study, teacher is only 5
 ek teacher hazaar chaatr ko padhaa rahaa hoga vahaan
 If you are from Bihar, then put your hands on your heart and say that you would like to leave Delhi University and get your child admitted to Patna University, knowing that there are no teachers there
 kai baar to lagata he ki pradhanmantri ko shatabdi varsh main jane kaa apana iraadaa hi badal dena chahie
 Our effort was that this information should reach the Prime Minister or else in his speech only the glory will be there, not present
 ve galat jaankaree ke shikaar ho jaaenge
 He should talk about empty class rooms, empty teachers in his speech
 mukhyamantri or up mukhyamantri se poochna chahie ki patna uniwarsity kii aisi haalat kyon he wo bhi tab jab donon vahiin ke chaatr hai, or unke karyaalay se ek ghante kii duuri par he
 By the way, the Prime Minister should also take a round of Patna, he will know how bad the cleanliness condition in the city is
 ve kisi gupt car main baithkar kisi bhi gali main chale jaaen, gandagi milegi
 a university that does not have a teacher to teach in many classes, some courses have been closed due to lack of teachers, does the university spend even a rupee in the name of celebrating the centenary year of a poor country like India and a poor state like Bihar should do? Fifty lakh-crore rupees will be spent on his reception, not only is it worth every second of the Prime Minister of the country, after all what Patna University will present to him
 ham kyon patna uniwarsity kaa shatabdi varsh manaa rahe hai? BK Mishra is the department chairman of the Juology Department of Patna University
 kabhi yahaan 24 se 26 professor hua karte the magar ab yah sirf 4 shikshakon ke dam par chal rahaa he
 Once Patna University used to be a part of the Department of Zoology in India and the world
 jio chemistry kaa vibhaag to kaaphi femes tha magar ab is vishay ko padhaane vaala koi professor hi nahin lihaaza band kar diya gaya he
 a professor has to teach many papers
 professor na hone ke kaaran research kaa kaam thapp ho gaya he
 Restoration was not done after 2003, some posts have been advertised but very few and that too is very slow
 neeli kameez main pi ke sinha jeeyololical survey of india se ritair hue hai, jo apane kharche par aakar padhaa jate hai
 Only such teachers should meet the Prime Minister coming for the centenary year
 jo uniwarsity khandhar ho chuki he, uske bheetar ye shikshak aatma kii tarah abhi bhi bache hue hai
 Prof
 BK Mishra said that in the sixties, when there were no ten thousand students in Patna University, then there were more than a thousand posts for teachers
 aaj jab yahaan ke chaatro kii sankhya bees hazaar ke kareeb pahunch gai he to shikshakon kii manzur padon kii sankhya bhi kam kar di gai he or usamen se bhi aadhe se zyaada khaali hai
 Teachers like Prof
 Mishra somehow take a class
 padhaa hi dete hai
 Some teachers say that considering the number of students in Patna University, there should be 2000 teachers, but 420 post khaali hai, 320 prophessoron ke dam par uniwarsity chal rahi he
 More posts are empty than what you are teaching
 is baar 150 padon kaa hi vigyaapan niklaa he, jo kaaphi nahin
 Even after the restoration of 150, 170 posts will remain vacant
 patna uniwarsity ke kai college main kai vibhaag aise hai jo ek ek profasaron ke bharose chal rahe hai
 The condition of Patna University started deteriorating from the 1980s
 jatvaad or gundgardee ne ise barbaad kiya or phir yah uniwarsity kabhi sanbhal nahin saki
 It has not been saved even in the last fifteen years
 is dauraan bihar se lakhon kii sankhya main chaatr dilli aakar padhane ke liye majaboor hue
 His parents taught him by selling land and applying hard work capital
 bhaavnaatmak or aarthik nuksaan hua
 Everyone used to study in Patna Science College here, the top students of Bihar used to study, now the top who does it comes to Delhi University, not the Science College
 science college ke bare main hamane jo jaankaree jutai he, aap bhi padhie
 If Bihar could not save Patna Science College, then what is left with it
 patna science college main 112 pad manzur hai
 But this college is running on the strength of only 28 professors
 jeev vigyaan 2, ganit main 3 or banaspati vigyaan main 6 hi shikshak hai
 There are only 1 teacher in English and two in Hindi
 aakhir ham ek rajya main kam se kam do hi uniwarsity dhang se kyon nahin chalaa pate hai
 Look at the state of any state, it is not worth mentioning
 kya padon ko isliye khaali rakhaa gaya taaki piechdi karne ke baad bhi kisi ko naukari na mili
 Seeing the number of these vacant posts, it seems that the dream of becoming a teacher of many youngsters has been crushed
 das das saal shikshakon ne edaha padhaakar apni jindagi tabah kar daali magar post hote hue bhi nahin bhare gaye
 If there is no filling then why is phd being done, for whom does UGC take the examination of NET
 patna lau college main 14 teacher ke pad hai magar 9 pad khaali hai
 Patna Law College is running on the strength of only 5 professors
 hindi vibhaag main 34 pad hai lekin 11 professor hi padhaa rahe hai
 Patna College has two and a half thousand students and only 30 teachers to teach
 patna college ke hindi vibhaag main 6 kii jagah 2 hi padhaa rahe hai
 Here in the history department, instead of 6, only one professor is teaching
 patna uniwarsity ke itihaas vibhaag kaa to haal or bhi bura he
 Ten years ago there used to be 25 professors, now there are only 6
 itihaas kaa bedaa gark isiilie ho rahaa he
 People are studying History in whatsapp University instead of Classroom
 magadh mahila college main kabhi 100 professor the, aaj 32 professor hai
 Five thousand girls study at Magadh Mahila College
 kya 32 professor paanch hazaar chaatraon ko padhaa sakate hai? hindi, itihaas or jeev vigyaan main padhaane ke liye ek ek professor hai
 There should be at least five five professors in these three departments
 aap soch rahe honge ki main kora aankada pard rahaa hum jiskaa kya matlab he
 We also never thought that this would be the condition of Patna University
 ek samay aisa bhi tha ki yahaan ke chaatr teen saal kaa bie chah saal main karte the, railgadee let hoti thi, magar yahaan to seshan hi let ho jaataa tha
 Thankfully, Seshal is not late
 pradhanmantri kaa daura hone vaala he isliye hamane jinase bhi baat kii, kisi karrwai kii ashanka main koi camere par nahin aayaa
 Students of Bihar know, cut it till matriculation here and then go to Delhi
 aap yaad kiijie, pichley das saal se bihar main padhai kii kamyaabi ke kisse koching sansthaanon se nikalate hai, uniwarsity se nahin
 If Bihar does not have a university, what is there to show the world and stop the migration of students
 bahut si sarkarein raheen magar koi ek uniwarsity na khadaa kar saki
 How will Patna University face the Prime Minister of India on October 14 or how will the Prime Minister face it? We have known the condition of many universities of the country
 yahi samaj aayaa ki paise waalon ne apane bacchon ko padhaane kaa kahin or intazaam kar liya he
 Arrangements have been made to ensure that the children of poor and ordinary people are unable to read so that they will remain where their ancestors lived for generations
 bade logon ko fark nahin padaa ki patna uniwarsity kii haalat kharaab he kyonki unke bacchon ne paise se duusari uniwarsity chun lee, rah gaye aam log to unhen khaali class rup main sapana dekhne ke liye bitha diya gaya
 One question is from you whether you are able to see what the condition of your children is going to be
 ek chota sa sawaal he, aap ye sab dekh kaise paa rahe hai
 The comments ek choti si jaankaree or
 SL College is a college in Sitamarhi
 paanch hazaar chaatr padhate hai, teacher maatr 5 hai
 a teacher must be teaching a thousand students there
 agar aap bihar ke hai to dil par haath rakhkar kahie ki kya aap dilli uniwarsity chhod kar apane bachche kaa admician patna uniwarsity main karana chahenge, yah jaanate hue ki vahaan teacher nahin hai
 At times, it seems that the Prime Minister should change his intention to enter the centenary year

 The condition of Patna University started deteriorating from the 1980s
 jatvaad or gundgardee ne ise barbaad kiya or phir yah uniwarsity kabhi sanbhal nahin saki
 It has not been saved even in the last fifteen years
 is dauraan bihar se lakhon kii sankhya main chaatr dilli aakar padhane ke liye majaboor hue
 His parents taught him by selling land and applying hard work capital
 bhaavnaatmak or aarthik nuksaan hua
 Everyone used to study in Patna Science College here, the top students of Bihar used to study, now the top who does it comes to Delhi University, not the Science College
 science college ke bare main hamane jo jaankaree jutai he, aap bhi padhie
 If Bihar could not save Patna Science College, then what is left with it
 patna science college main 112 pad manzur hai
 But this college is running on the strength of only 28 professors
 jeev vigyaan 2, ganit main 3 or banaspati vigyaan main 6 hi shikshak hai
 There are only 1 teacher in English and two in Hindi
 aakhir ham ek rajya main kam se kam do hi uniwarsity dhang se kyon nahin chalaa pate hai
 Look at the state of any state, it is not worth mentioning
 kya padon ko isliye khaali rakhaa gaya taaki piechdi karne ke baad bhi kisi ko naukari na mili
 Seeing the number of these vacant posts, it seems that the dream of becoming a teacher of many youngsters has been crushed
 das das saal shikshakon ne edaha padhaakar apni jindagi tabah kar daali magar post hote hue bhi nahin bhare gaye
 If there is no filling then why is phd being done, for whom does UGC take the examination of NET
 patna lau college main 14 teacher ke pad hai magar 9 pad khaali hai
 Patna Law College is running on the strength of only 5 professors
 hindi vibhaag main 34 pad hai lekin 11 professor hi padhaa rahe hai
 Patna College has two and a half thousand students and only 30 teachers to teach
 patna college ke hindi vibhaag main 6 kii jagah 2 hi padhaa rahe hai
 Here in the history department, instead of 6, only one professor is teaching
 patna uniwarsity ke itihaas vibhaag kaa to haal or bhi bura he

 Five thousand girls study at Magadh Mahila College

 There should be at least five five professors in these three departments
