 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee broke the silence for the first time on the violence in Malda last Sunday

 According to Mamta, the case has been misrepresented
 sthaneey logon or biguef ke bich kaa maamalamamta ne apane bayaan main kaha ki asal main yah sthaneey logon or seemaa suraksha bal (biguef) ke bich kaa maamla tha
 However the matter has been handled and now the situation is fully under control

 In fact, this mob was organizing a protest march against the alleged remarks made by the Hindu Mahasabha leader Kamlesh Tiwari on the Prophet Mohammad

 bijepi kya bhartiya bazaar ke sabase bade udaarikaran ko rokane kii jid chhod rahi he? kya pradhanmantri narendra modi khudara kaarobaar ke sher ko jagaane kii himmat juta chuke hai, jo 125 karod upabhoktaaon va 600 arab dollar ke kaarobaar kii takat se las he or jahaan videshi va nijee nivesh ke baad puri arthvyavastha main bahuaiami growth kaa ingine chaalu ho saktaa he
 If the decision of the 51% foreign investment in retail business does not show the consent of the new government and the approval of the states of BJP and its allies, then it should be considered as the boldest gift of the first anniversary of the Modi government
 yah keval bijepi kii rudhivaadee jid thi, jiske chalate desh kevishaal khudara bazarko aadhuniktaa kii roshni nahin mil saki, jo buniyadi dhaanche, kheti, rojgaar se lekar upabhoktaaon tak ko phayda pahunchaa sakati he
 The liberalization of retail could not take place either
 pichhali sarkaar ne sitambar 2012 main multi brands retail main 51 fisadi videshi nivesh khol to diya lekin bijepi ke jabardast virodh ke baad, niveshkon ko ijaajat dene kaa vikalp rajyon par chhod diya gaya tha
 Politics had become such that no state showed any courage to move forward
 khudara kaarobaar main epadiai par sarkaar kaa you-turn taaja he kyonki isi april main, vaanijya va udyog mantri nirmala sitaraman ne loksabhaa ko bataaya tha ki multi brands retail main videshi nivesh kii niti par amal par koi faisla nahin hua he
 This aspect of change probably stems from the policy on land acquisition
 modi sweekaar kar rahe hai ki vipaksh main rahete ek sakht bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon kii vakaalat, bijepi kii galati thi
 a similar mistake was made in retail through opposition to FDI, which now is the time to correct it
 khudara kaarobaar main videshi nivesh kii seemaa 51 fisadi karne kaa nirnay thik unhinchunautiyon kii dentha, jinase ab modi sarkaar mukaabil he
 Upset by the recession and unemployment, the UPA government wanted to bring foreign investment in the retail business so that growth could be opened
 yah ek krantikari udaarikaran tha
 So the global image was also going to shine
 modi sarkaar pichley ek saal main rojgaron kii ekamusth aapurti badhaane yaa bade sudhaaron kaa kaul nahin dikhaa saki
 However, now the opportunity is there
 udyog mantralay ke taaja dastavej ke mutabik bijepi, uske sahyogi dalon va congress ko milakar rajasthan, maharashtra karnataka, andhra pradesh samet 12 rajya khudara kaarobaar main videshi companiyon ko pravesh dene par raji hai
 Never before has there been such a state of support
 yah videshi retail companiyon ko bulaane kaa saahas dikhaane kaa sabase acha avasar he
 India's consumption consumption is the engine of the economy, which led to the fastest growth between 2004 and 2009
 retail bazaar ke peeche kheti he, bich main udyog hai or aage upabhokta
 Consumption spending creates a cycle of demand, employment, income growth, spending and consumption, which is the foundation of retail
 retail bharat main rojgaron kaa teesraa sabase bada strot he jisamen chaar karod log lage hai
 The Ministry of Skill Development considers that by 2022 around 5 in the region
 5 karod logon ko rojgaar milegaa
 This assessment is not based on the potential for growth from foreign investment in the region
 boston kansalting kii taaja report bataati he ki bharat kaa khudara kaarobaar 2020 tak ekakharab dollar kaa hojayega, jo aaj 600 arab dollar par he
 Modernization of the retail business can be the biggest source of jobs as most of the jobs in organized retail, from supply chains to stores, are created
 paaramparik retail main videshi nivesh par asamanjas ke bich i-retail ke kaaran asangatiyaan bad rahi hai
 Questions of tax, investment, quality, transparency have their place in e-retail
 isse delivery main se zyada behatar rojgaar bhi nahin nikle hai
 The new investment in retail can return the demand for construction which is currently in deep recession and is another major source of employment and demand after farming
 retail upabhokta utpaada udyogon ke liye nayaa bazaar or dasiyon tarah kii sevaayen lekar aata he jo ki mek in india kaa hissaa he
 Food and groceries account for 60 per cent of retail, which is directly linked to agriculture
 aadhunik retail, kisaanon or laghu udyogon ke liye ek bada bazaar hoga
 Some new facts about retail confirm that the government can fuel its growth engine
 jidipi kii nai gananaa ke mutabik, aarthik growth kii raftaar paanch fisadi se badhkar 7
 The growth of large wholesale and retail businesses is behind 5 per cent
 is kaarobaar ke samgr aakaar ko jidipi gananaa kaa purana aankada pakad nahin paata tha
 Under the old scale, the employment survey of NSSO was used to measure the contribution of wholesale and retail business to GDP, but in the new formula, based on cell tax data, it was found that wholesale and retail business is not only 20 percent of the economy
 It is rather double the speed of GDP
 bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon main badlaavon ke virodh main rahul-sonia ke bhaashanon ko, khudara main videshi nivesh ke khilaaf arun jetali ke bhaashan ke saath sunanaa behatar hoga
 It will be realized from this that politics of India is an opportunistic game from election to election and congress-bjp are very poor in policy foresight
 alabatta faisle badalanaa saahsee raajnneeti kaa pramaan bhi he
 Therefore, if the Prime Minister is showing the courage of new thinking, then he should also show the courage to liberalize the huge retail market of 125 crore people with land acquisition, which could not proceed only due to the political politics of BJP
 unka yah saahas arthvyavastha kii surat or sirat, donon badal saktaa he
 Senior BJP leader and Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj hit back at the Congress, replying that the NDA won an overwhelming majority in the Lok Sabha elections as a marketing propaganda by the Congress and said that the marketing should not only be good but the product should also be good
 sushamaa ne congress netaa mallikajarun khadge kii bhaajapa dwaara marketing ke jariye hasil kii gai jeet kii tippanee par palatwaar kiya or kaha, marketing to aap (congress) ne bhi kii, lekin marketing kaa ek buniyadi siddhant he ki product acha hona chahie
 In addition to taking a dig at Congress, Sushma said that the huge responsibility that has been won by the NDA has come on her shoulders as much responsibility, which she will discharge with all the allies
 unhone mahabharat main bhishma pitamah or yuddhishthir ke bich ke samvaad ko uddhrut karte hue kaha, kabhi ateet ko koskar apni jimmedaari se vimukh nahin hone kaa sandesh bhishma pimamah ne yuddhishthir ko diya tha, kyonki ateet hi yadi acha hota to janata use badalati nahin
 The foreign minister intervened to discuss the vote of thanks on the President's address, saying that public anger towards the UPA government and the acceptance of BJP as an alternative to Narendra Modi became the basis for such a big victory
 unhone samprag sarkaar main mahangaai kii maar, bhrashtachar, ghotaalon kii bharmaar, kisaanon ke haahaakaar, yuva berozegaar, mahilaon se duraachaar, sansthaaon se rduvyavahaar or simaaon par sainikon se bure bartaav ko pichhali sarkaar kii paraajay kaa kaaran bataaya or saath hi kaha ki sarkaar in sabhi mochare par sudhaar ke liye kaary karegi
 Recently, in the instant messaging app whatsapp, the company has given the feature of two step verification for better security
 isse pehle fasebuk main isi feechar ke tahat security kii kaa feechar diya gaya tha
 Gmail already has security and two-step authentication features
 google kaa ek khaas othenticketer ap he jo jimail ko sicyor karata he
 What is this two step verification? Two step verification is actually a feature of extra security
 iske tahat acount log-in karne se pehle sirf password hi nahin balki pin kii jarurat hoti he
 For example, if you use Gmail Katu Step Authentication, you will have to enter the PIN of the message received on the mobile after the password to login the email
 iske baad hi aapkaa jimail khulegaa
 That is, if someone has gassed your password, then they will not be able to open your account, because before that a PIN will come on your number
 kya he security kii?tu step veriphication kii tarah hi security kii bhi hoti he
 It looks similar to a common pen drive, but it is of particular U2F security
 ise aap online kharid sakate hai jisaki keemat 1,500 rupee se shuru hoti he
 You can use it in those accounts which have the option to add security key
 haal hi main fasebuk ne security kii kaa opshan joda he to aap ise fasebuk ke saath bhi yuj kar sakate hai
 Security key has to be added with your account
 udhaaharan ke taur par aapane apane fasebuk se security kii ko jod liya he to idi or password ke baad aapako computer main security kii lagaani hogi
 No account will be opened without security key
 yani agar kisi ko aapkaa password pataa bhi he to wo aapkaa acount nahin khol saktaa he
 This feature has also come in whatsapp, apart from facebook, it is now a feature of two step verification in whatsapp too
 settings se aap chah disit kaa password banaate hai
 If you want to take your account to another phone, like before, not only will the mobile number be asked, but the six digit code will also be asked here

 He said that we are ready to work out a solution with both sides
 upi sarkaar har sambhav madad ke liye taiyaar he
 After this, a new twist is seen in this matter once again
 nath sampradaay kii panrapara ko aage badhaate yogi adityanath ram mandir ke nirmaan ko puraa kar sakenge yaa nahin, ye to bhavishya tay karegaa par is sampradaay kaa ram mandir se purana naata rahaa he
 The guru of the UP CM Yogi Adityanath's Guru who played a key role in laying the foundation of the Ram temple, it seems that Yogi will complete the work now
 vaise to, nath sampradaay ke mahanton main adityanath sarvaadhik lokapriy hai
 But the credit of showing the direction of the path on which they are today is given to Mahant Digvijaynath
 mahant digvijaynath, adityavnath ke guru mahant avaidhyanath ke guru the
 He himself had contributed significantly in installing the idol of Ramlala inside the Babri Masjid
 CM yogi sakht, boojadkhaane hi nahin
 
 
 These works can also be done in UP
 Digvijaynath is said to have joined the All India Ramayana Mahasabha in 1949
 isi mahasabha ne babari masjid ke saamne nau divasiy ramcharitamanas kaa paath yojit kiya, jiske ant main masjid ke bheetar bhagwaan ram or sita kii murtiyon ko sthapit kiya gaya
 Some reports also say that the statue of Ramlala was installed by Digvijaynath itself
 digvijaynath kii charchaa isliye bhi jaruri he kyonki 1934 main jab ve nath sampradaay ke mahant bane to mandir kattar hindutv kii raajnneeti kaa kendra ban gaya tha
 He was also arrested for his involvement in the conspiracy to assassinate Mahatma Gandhi
 mumbai police ne ek shav kii shinaakht ke liye unnat forensik technology kii madad kii zarurat jataai he

 dilli congress main shila banaam maakan kaa jhagada ab gandhi parivaar ke darbar main pahunch gaya he
 After the defeat in the MCD elections, Sheela had asked for Ajay Maken's resignation, Maken had also resigned, but no decision was taken on it, but Maken was asked to continue working till the decision was taken
 aise main haal main shila ke netritv main dilli ke taqariban ek darjan party netaaon kii baithak rajya sabha saansad kapil sibbal ke ghar par hui
 In the meeting, all the leaders questioned the working style of Maken
 sabhi netaaon ne ek memorondom bhi taiyaar kiya or sabhi ne isko rahul ko saunp diya
 These leaders, including Sheila, have also sought time to meet Sonia
 ajay maakan ke khilaaf party ke is andruni morche ne apane memorondom main ajay maakan kaa istipha to nahin maanga he, lekin yah saafe kaha he ki wo party ke netaaon ko saath lekar nahin chal rahe
 These leaders argue that Maken was given a free hand, he distributed tickets on his own, but still lost the party badly
 yahi nahin, kai netaa ajay maakan par aarope lagaate hue party chhod ke chale gaye
 It is also alleged that Maken made every strategy alone and there is no question from senior party leaders
 shila ne to emsidi kii haar ke baad ajay maakan kaa istipha maanga tha

 in netaaon kii maang he ki, dilli main aisa netaa ho jo agle vidhansabha chunaav se pehle sabhi ko saath lekar aam aadmi party or bijepi ko majboot takkar de
 The party needs to be strengthened at this time because, at this time, the party has become dead in Delhi
 in netaaon ne apana memorondom rahul ko saunpa, to baad main shila dikshit ne vyaktigat taur par bhi rahul se milakar ajay maakan kii shikaayat kii he or pradesh congress ko durdasha se nikaalane kii guzarish kii
 According to sources, Ajay Maken told Rahul that the party's vote percentage has increased in the MCD elections and by-elections in Rajouri Garden Assembly
 isliye shila ne khaastaur shila ne rahul se mulaakaat main maakan ke is daawey ko ye kahkar khaarij karne kii koshish kii ki, rajanithik dal chunaav jeetne or sarkaar banane ke liye chunaav ladate hai na kii vot pratishat badhaane ke liye
 In such a situation, if the country's largest party will be happy with the increase in vote percentage then it is unfortunate
 haalanki, is mudde parashila dikshit nekoi bhi baat karne se inkaar kar diya
 According to sources, the leaders of the anti-maken camp have decided that, since they are currently talking to the high command, they will not discuss this with the media
 kul milakar bhale hi dilli main congress tisare nambar kii party bani hui he, lekin shila banaam maakan kii ladaai thamane ke bajaay badhati ja rahi he
 In such a situation, the dream of the Congress to return to Delhi is still far-fetched

 This is because the group may be accused of seeking the help of a celebrity like them, but the group may contact them in the future
 swaraj abhiyaan ke netaa yogendra yadav ne goa main kaha, ‘hamaari bhavishya main unhen (anna hajaare ko) jodne kii ichha ho sakati he
 We will request them to support us and guide us, but we have not yet contacted them
 ’ yadav ek nijee daure par goa gaye hai or vah sthaneey netaaon se bhi mulaakaat karenge
 He said that if they do, then the Swaraj Abhiyan, a group formed by AAP leaders Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan, will be accused of seeking help from a big figure like other parties, including you
 yadav ne kaha, ‘unhone inkaar nahin kiya he
 We have not gone to him for guidance
 ’ unhone kaha ki ve desh ke liye sangharsh kar rahe saadhaaran logon se mil rahe hai or yah adhik mahatvapurn he
 Yadav, while replying to a question, refused to give between one and 10 points to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on the basis of performance
 netaa ne kaha, ‘aankane ke liye har mukhyamantri ko ek lanbaa samay diya janaa chahie
 It would be wrong to judge them now
 ’ Yadav said, 'actually we have made a policy of Swaraj Abhiyan that we will not comment on aap's everyday affairs
 media ko yah pasand he lekin ham tippanee nahin karenge
 He said, 'we commented on the case of Tomar (former Law Minister of Delhi), we commented on the matter of public advertisement issued by the Delhi Government

 unhone kaha, ‘har chaynit sarkaar ko apane adhikariyon ko sthanantarit karne kaa adhikaar hona chahie
 i think the politics of conflict of order is an immature way of trying to get full statehood
 yah ek bahut jaij maang sambandhi maamle se nipatane kaa ek bahut bachakaana tarika he
 This immaturity may have adverse effects rather than being achieved
 ’ yadav ne ek anya prashn ke uttar main daawa kiya ki aap netaaon ne samjhauta kiya he lekin iskaa yah matlab nahin he ki swayasevakon ne bhi aisa kiya he
 He said, 'no general volunteer has compromised

 Yadav said, 'they have not denied

 yadav ne ek prashn kaa jawaab dete hue dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko pradarshan ke aadhaar par ek se 10 se bich ank dene se inkaar kar diya
 The leader said, 'every Chief Minister should be given a long time to assess

 ’ yadav ne kaha ki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja die jane kii maang nyyochit he

 mujhe lagata he ki aadesh ke takaraav kii raajnneeti purna rajya kaa darja paane kii koshish karne kaa ek aparipakv rasta he
 This is a very childish way of dealing with a very legitimate demand related matter
 is aparipakvata ke kaaran kuch hasil hone ke bajaae pratikul asar pad saktaa he
 In response to another question, Yadav claimed that the AAP leaders have compromised but this does not mean that volunteers have done so as well
 unhone kaha, ‘kisi saamaanya swayamsevak ne samjhauta nahin kiya he
 You are some of the best social activists in the movement
 unhone bhrashtachar se samjhauta nahin kiya he
 This feeling of theirs has to be kept alive
 ’tippaniyan Yogendra Yadav said that he had not yet received a letter to expel him from the party
 yadav ne kaha, ‘mujhe televijan channelon ke madhyam se pataa chalaa ki mujhe nishkasit kar diya gaya he
 i have written a letter to the disciplinary committee of AAP regarding giving me the expulsion letter which they have not given
 ’ When Yadav was asked how he felt when he was expelled from the party, he said, 'I am not one of those who can express their feelings but it does not look good when you are kept out of your own house
 yah acha nahin lagata
 'he said,' but you also remind yourself that you have chosen to walk on a difficult path, it will be a long journey, a stumbling block cannot stop a long journey

 Agriculture has also been affected in the country due to water crisis

 Sainath mentioned various aspects of the water crisis
 unhone kaha ki log kehete hai ki aglaa vishwayuddh pani ke liye hoga, mujhe pataa nahin yah kab hoga, lekin pani ko lekar pichley do hajaar saal se jang chal rahi he
 P
 sainath ne kaha ki pani par raajnneeti or pani ke liye rajaneta hona donon main antar he
 Media coverage is also not proving helpful in dealing with water crisis
 agar ham barish ko lekar pichley do yaa teen saptaah ke akhabaaron kii hedlins dekhen to pataa chalegaa ki jal sankat ko kis simit najariye se dekha ja rahaa he
 One thing is clear that there is no improvement in the level of ground water due to rain water
 unhone kaha ki andhra pradesh kii baat bataate hai
 Take the example of the last few years
 pichley 20 varshon main se 16 varsh andhra pradesh main sookhe kii sthiti rahi he
 The most important is the issue of water sharing
 bhartiya mausam vigyaan vibhaag (IMD) ne 2018 main kaha tha ki monsoon kareeb-kareeb saamaanya rahaa he
 But in the last 100 years, i am not aware that there has been such a category regarding the monsoon
 matlab aap kah rahe hai ki aadmi isiu main he, lekin mara nahin he
 They are telling the rains to be close to normal because of less rain than usual
 pi
 Sainath said that imd's region-wise figures show that the rate of rainfall has come down drastically
 pani kaa masalaa aam nahin balki yah raajnneetik, saamaajik or aarthik masalaa bhi he
 Interstate disputes over water have also been discussed
 pichley 100 saalon se dakshin ke rajyon main jal vivaad bada masalaa bana hua he
 How long has the two states been in dispute over the sharing of water in Kaveri? The dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu has not been resolved till date
 unhone bataaya ki assi ke dashak main logon ko punjab main khalistaani andolan to yaad hoga lekin punjab, haryana or rajasthan ke bich ravi-beas nadi ke jal bantwaare ko lekar kitne daur kii baithak chali yah kisi ke jehan main nahin hoga
 During that time, 28 rounds of talks were held between the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sant Longowala on this issue
 yah charchaa guuruvaani yaa anya mudde par nahin balki pani ke masale ko sulajhane ko lekar hui thi
 P
 sainath ne kaha ki lagaataar likhaa ja rahaa he ki pani ke liye aglaa vishwa yuddh hoga
 i do not know when this will happen, but it is true that for the last 2000 years there has been a war on water
 ham roj-ba-roj pani ke liye lard-jhagad rahe hai
 Telangana vs Andhra Pradesh, Kurnool vs Mehboob Nagar is a dispute over water
 pani ke liye bhai, bhai kii hatya kar rahaa haiunhone kaha ki yah jhagade pariwaron tak pahunch gaye hai
 a few years ago a farmer died in Kurnool and left 20 acres of land for his five sons
 saamaanya si baat he 20 acre jameen he to harek bete ko chaar acre jameen milegi
 But the younger brother killed his elder brother, whereas the division of land was the easiest
 lekin unke bich jhagada borwell ko lekar tha ki kiske hisse main borwell aayega
 That is, brother killed brother for water
 yah jhagada rajya ke str se utar kar parivaar tak pahunch gaya
 There is a dispute between India and Pakistan over Farakka barrage

 The National Human Rights Commission team has admitted that there was an exodus of Hindus from Kairana
 ayog ne apni report main yah bhi kaha he ki palaayan kii vajah dar he
 Also, the Commission has also sought a report of the action taken so far in the case from the UP government
 saal 2013 main hue mujffarnagar dangon ke baad kairana main 25 se 30 hajaar muslimon ko basaaya gaya tha
 In the report, this too has been cited as a major reason for the exodus of Hindus

 In contrast to the Muslim administration's report, the NHRC reported in its report that during the investigation, its panel spoke to several witnesses and surveyed 3 colonies of Kairana
 isse pataa laga ki 'saal 2013 main mujffarnagar danga peediton kaa punarvaas kiya gaya
 Due to this, 25 to 30 thousand Muslims came to Kairana and the population ratio changed in this area and Muslims came in majority
 adhikansh gavaahon or peediton ne mana ki saal 2013 ke baad kairana kii saamaajik sthiti bilkul badal gai or is vajah se yahaan kanoon vyavastha bhi badtar hoti chali gai
 According to the report, about 24 witnesses believed that boys from the Muslim community used to pass comments on seeing Hindu girls in the area
 is vajah se mahilaon ne ghar se baahar janaa chhod diya tha
 However, the women could not muster enough courage to complain to the police
 kuch logon ne yah bhi mana he ki hinduon ke kairana chhodane ke peeche yah bhi ek badi vajah thi
 Now the NHRC has sent a notice to the Chief Secretary and Director General of Police, UP Government based on its investigation
 taaki is maamle main ab tak kii karrwai kii report saunpe

 The problem of non-performing assets in front of banks has become more serious after the statement of former Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan
 loksabhaa kii estimet cameti ko likhe patr main raghuram rajan ne NPA samasya ke rahasy se pardaa uthaate hue likhaa he ki desh ke bank ek time bam par baithe hai or jald is bam ko niskriy nahin kiya gaya to ise fatne se koi roak nahin saktaa
 Significantly, the Estimate Committee had appealed the former governor to appear before the committee and asked banks to present their views on npas
 cameti ne rajan ko apana paksh patr ke jariye rakhane kii chhot bhi di thi jiske baad raghuram rajan ne enpie par silsilewar dhang se loksabhaa kii samiti ko apana jawaab diya
 Raghuram Rajan claimed that banks have the highest number of bad loans which were allocated between 2006 and 2008
 bhartiya arthvyavastha ke liye yah aisa samay tha jab aarthik vikaas dar behad acchhee thi or bainkon ko adhik se adhik karj dekar is raftaar ko badhaane kii jarurat thi
 But in such a situation, banks should have made sure that the companies to whom they are lending have good health before giving loans and are in a position to pay their debts on time
 bemisaal he bainkon kii laaparvaaheeraghuram rajan ne daawa kiya ki jahaan bainkon ne is dauraan nayaa karj baantne main laaparvaahee barti vahiin aise logon ko karj dene kaa kaam kiya jinka karj nahin lautaane kaa itihaas rahaa he
 So, it was a big mistake of the banks and the beginning of dirty debt in the country
 rajan ne daawa kiya ki is daur main karj lene vaale ek pramotor ne unhen bataaya ki bank aise logon ko bhi karj de rahaa tha jinhen karj kii jarurat nahin thi or bank ne mahaj company se yah bataane ke liye kaha ki use kitne rupayon kaa karj chahie or vah karj company ko de diya gaya
 The Modi government will adopt the Manmohan formula to save the falling rupee? However, Raghuram Rajan said that in other countries of the world it was also seen that when the economy is doing well, banks prefer to give more and more debt to the market
 
 lekin aisi sthiti main bank ko jarurat se zyada sajag rahane kii jarurat thi kyonki in karjon ke waapas na lautne se tej daudti arthvyavastha kamjor pad sakati he
 It was not expected from the public sector banks, that Rajaram Raju wrote that while the NPA was blaming the country's banking system, the role of the country's public banks in the game of NPA was very poor
 rajan ke mutabik sarkari bainkon se karj aavanton main aisi laaparvaahee kii ummid nahin kii ja sakati thi
 According to Rajan, after lending, the banks did not rectify the time spent by the companies, due to which most of the companies started misusing the loan money
 vahiin kuch pramotars ne bainkon kii is laaparvaahee ke chalate saste upkarnon kii mahangi kharid dikhaane ke liye farji raseed kaa sahaara liya or bainkon ne isaki jaanch kiye bagaiyr unhen paas karne kaa kaam bade str par kiya
 Rajan claimed that country private banks shied away from lending to companies where there was a fear of sinking money but state-run banks did not learn from it and continued to lend to defaulting companies
 upie or endie kii kamajoriraghuram rajan ne loksabhaa kii samiti ko likhe patr main daawa kiya ki jahaan bank bade str par companiyon ko karj dene kaa kaam kar rahe the vahiin desh main pehle upie or phir endie sarkarein faisla lene main deree karti raheen
 During this time, there was a question on the allocation of coal mines, delay in deciding on other infrastructure projects and as a result, most of the projects started by taking loans were either unable to start, their cost was increased or it started
 There was a chance to close the projects
 niti ayog ko bhi rajan kii do tobehaal hi main niti ayog ke vaais chairman rajeev kumaar ne daawa kiya ki beete teen saal arthvyavastha main darj hui giravat ke liye rigerv bank ke purv governor raghuram rajan jimmedaar hai
 Rajiv Kumar said that Rajan's economic policies are responsible for the 9 consecutive quarterly declines before the first quarter of FY 2018-19
 rajeev kumaar ne kaha ki beete teen saal ke dauraan vikaas dar main giravat bank ke enpie main hui badhotaree ke chalate he
 Kumar said that when the Modi government took power, the NPA of the banks was Rs 4 lakh crore
 lekin march 2017 tak yah enpie badhkar 10
 Crossed the 5 lakh crore mark
 enpie main hui is badhat ke chalate teen saal ke dauraan jidipi main lagaataar giravat dekhne ko mili or iske liye sirf raghuram rajan jimmedaar hai
 Rejecting these allegations, Rajan told the parliamentary committee that this statement was given without any homework from NITI Aayog
 rajan ne kaha ki jab unke kaarykaal main bainke kii kharaab balanceshit ko sudhaarney kii kavayad shuru kii gai to kuch logon ne nihit swaarth ke chalate vikaas dar ke mudde par kendriya bank ko jimmedaar tehraane kaa kaam kiya
 Rajan said that he wanted the bank to stop hiding its dirty debts and start stalled projects as soon as possible so that the bank could get back a large part of its loan money
 lekin is kaam ko bainkon ne uchit dhang se nahin kiya or bainkon ke enpie main lagaataar ijapha hota rahaa
 After this clarification of Rajan, the politics going on on the problem of NPA is expected to get a new direction
 haalanki ab jahaan congress netaa kapil sibbal or purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram yah daawa karte rahe ki enpie kii samasya upie ke kaarykaal ke baad vikat hui vahiin sattarudh endie kaa daawa he ki enpie kii samasya unhen viraasat main mili he
 In such a situation, it is to be seen that political parties will give a new dimension to the mutual fight on the NPA issue

 Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has surrounded the Modi government by seeking evidence related to the surgical strike, while Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam has been isolated in his own party, calling the surgical strike as fake
 kejariwal ke khilaaf dilli to nirupam ke khilaaf mumbai main virodh-pradarshan ho rahe hai
 Social leaders are also making fun of these leaders
 aisi khabaren hai ki sena ne sarkaar kosargical strikse jude saboot saarvajanik karne ko hari jhandi de di he
 An English newspaper has also made a big disclosure about the surgical strike
 akhbaar ne chashmadidon ke hawaale se khabar di he ki 29 sitambar kii raat hue hamale main maare gaye logon ke shavon ko bhor se pehle hi trek main ladakar le jaaya gaya or unhen dafan kar diya gaya
 That is, after these developments, those who have raised questions about the surgical strike have stopped speaking
 vidhansabha chunaavon main bhunaane kaa maukaab sawaal uthta he ki kya modi sarkaar sargical strike se jude video footage yaa tasviren saarvajanik karegi yaa sena kii jariye ise duniya ke saamne laaegi
 Assembly elections are due in the coming days in some states including UP and Punjab
 piem modi navaratri ke maukey par upi vidhansabha chunaav ke liye prachaar abhiyaan kii joardaar shuruyaat bhi karne kii taiyaari main hai
 If Modi and his party BJP go to the assembly elections on this issue, then the message will go out among the public that the government has fulfilled the promise it had made
 vaise bhi jis din dijiemo ne press conference kar sargical strike kii jaankaree di, usee samay se sarkaar or bijepi samarthakon ne piem modi ke paksh main hawa banane kii koshish shuru kar di
 Because after the martyrdom of 18 soldiers in Uri attack, there was great pressure on the Modi government to take tough measures against Pakistan
 log piem modi ke chunavi vaadon kaa zikr karte hue yaad dilaa rahe the ki 56 inch ke seene kaa kya hua
 But now on the basis of these evidences the Modi government can say that it has taken revenge for the martyrdom of the martyrs
 pakistan ko tamaachasrgical strike se jude saboot jagajaahir kar modi sarkaarpakistan ko ainadikha sakati he
 Because Pakistan still does not believe that Indian Army commandos entered its occupied area, destroyed the terrorists' camps and returned without any harm
 pakistan is ghatana ko doosraa mode dekar ise sijafire kaa ulanghan tehraane main juta he
 Apart from this, the statements of leaders like Kejriwal, Nirupam, Digvijay Singh and p Chidambaram give Pakistan a boost
 pakistan kii media in netaaon ke bayanon ke aadhaar par bharat kii maujuuda sarkaar or bhartiya sena ko nicha dikhaane main koi kasar nahin chhod rahi he
 On this pretext, the ruling rulers of Pakistan are busy blowing up the claims of the Modi government
 padosiyon ko bhi sabkaindian army ke sargical strike ko america, britain or rus samet tamaam deshon kaa samarthan mila he
 However, Pakistan sees the incident as a defeat, so is not willing to consider it a surgical strike and is repeatedly threatening nuclear bombs
 uri hamale ke baad bharat ne tamaam padosi mulkon ko apane paale main khinch liya or pakistan ko alag-thalag kar liya
 But China, blind in the love of Pakistan, is playing bets to teach India a lesson
 dragon ne bharat or pakistan ko aapasi baatcheet ke jariye tanaav kam karne kii naseehat bhi di he
 After the strike evidence comes out, Pakistan will be completely exposed that the crop of terror is sweeping its land
 iske alaava anya deshon ko bhi isse sabak milegi
 In such circumstances, if the Modi government makes public the evidence related to the surgical strike, then it will only benefit

 Jio Phone 2 has more apps than this and also has 4G internet connectivity
 camera bhi jeeyo phone kaa better he
 As far as the feature phone is concerned, it should remain separate from the smartphone
 kyonki ab saste main kai smartphone hai jinaki keemat feechar phone se thodi hi zyada hoti he

 ye thodaa complicated bhi he
 Can say that Nokia has kept the feature phone as a feature phone
 pyor feechar phone kharidne kii taiyaari main hai to aap nokia ke is phone kaa intjaar kar sakate hai

 The by-election results have come for the assembly seats in four states
 inase ek baat to jaahir he ki modi kii wo lahar jisane puure bharat ko jhakzor diya tha, ab nahin dikh rahi he
 In Bihar, lalu-nitish alliance has got a lot of success, then BJP in Karnataka has been hit hard
 bihar main is gathbandhan ne bijepi kii kuch siten chin leen, jinamein bhagalpur kii seat he
 bjp's defeat on this seat is also surprising because this city has been the stronghold of Jana Sangh and later BJP for decades
 yahaan uske alaava anya partiyon ko jeetne ke liye edi-chotii kaa jor lagaana padataa he lekin is baar bijepi bahut aasaani se yah seat haar gai
 Neither the party raised any sort of candidate nor campaigned bluntly
 kamjor ummidavaar or janata se netritv kii duuri uski haar kaa kaaran ban gai
 The party lost the Lok Sabha seat there and despite that no lesson was learned from it
 unhone ummidavaaron ke chayan main jaraa bhi vivek se kaam nahin liya or janata se bhi puraa samvaad banaae nahin rakhaa
 In contrast, the lalu-nitish alliance took every step thoughtfully
 unhone sampradayikta ke aadhaar par voton ko bantane na dene ke liye ek bhi alpsankhyak ko tikat nahin diya
 On the other hand there seems to be a leadership crisis in the BJP and the voters are not happy with the current top leaders
 bihar main tikaton ke bantwaare ko lekar bhi party ke netaaon ke bare main kaaphi baaten kahi gayi
 It seems that the sense of overconfidence in the state units of the BJP has been filled only when it lost the seat of Bellary Rural in Karnataka
 is seat ko congress ne jhatak liya jabaki party ummid kar rahi thi ki vahaan vah phir satta main kabiz hone kii ore agrasar he
 In Karnataka, its rebel leader Yeddyurappa is back in the party
 iske baavjood party upachunaav main ek mahatvapurn seat haar gai
 This may be a matter of concern for the party as it is expecting a return to the state
 bijepi ke liye yah santosh kaa vishay ho saktaa he ki usne madhya pradesh main apana dabadabaa banaae rakhaa he or shivaraj singh ne vipakshi dal congress ko dhul chataa di or apana varchasv sthapit kiya
 He strengthened his grip
 isi tarah punjab main akali dal or congress main barabari kaa muqabla rahaa
 Right now it would be wrong to draw any conclusions about there
 bihar main vidhaan sabha chunaav main zyada vakt nahin he
 The result of the Vidhan Sabha elections is like a alarm bell for the BJP
 baat saaf he ki loksabhaa chunaav main janata ne jahaan narendra modi ke liye hami bhari thi vahiin in chunaavon main aisa kuch nahin tha balki log sthaneey muddon par vot de rahe hai
 The results of the by-elections never lead to conclusions about the main election but still the bjp's state unit will have to rethink where and what went wrong
 jivan main grahon kaa prabhaav bahut prabal mana jaataa he or us par bhi shani grah ashaant ho jaaen to jivan main kashton kaa aagaman shuru ho jaataa he
 Therefore, what should the devotees suffering from Shani Dosha do to worship Shani Dev on Saturday and keep their fast on fasting day
 
 
 - brahm muhoort main uthakar naha dhokar or saaf kapade pahanakar pipal ke vriksh par jal arpan karen
 - Take an idol of Shani Devta made of iron, bathe with panchamrit
 - phir murti ko chawlon se banaae choubees dal ke camel par sthapit karen
 After this, worship with black sesame, flowers, incense, black clothes and oil etc
 - pujan ke dauraanshani ke das naamonka uccharan karen- konesth, krishna, pippala, souri, yama, pingalo, rodrotko, babhru, mand, shanaishchar
 After the worship, do seven circumambulation with a thread of yarn on the stem of the Peepal tree
 - iske baad shanidev kaa mantra padhate hue prarthana karen
 
 
 Shanaichar Namastubhyam Namaste Twath Rahway
 ketveath namastubhyan sarvashantiprado bhav
kinate din tak karen pujisi tarahsaat shanivaar tak vratakarte hue shani ke prakope se suraksha ke liye shani mantra kii samidhaon main, rahu kii kudrushti se suraksha ke liye durva kii samidha main, ketu se suraksha ke liye ketu mantra main kusha kii samidha main, krishna jau, kaale til se 108 aahuti prayek ke liye deni chahie
 Then, according to your economic capacity, make a donation to the Brahmins by giving them food, iron items, money etc
 kai baar virodhiyon kii aalochana main itane aage bad jate hai ki satya bahut peeche chhot jaataa he or bas jhooth par aadhaarit nerrative aage badhata jaataa he
 Such criticism does not take into account the facts
 ham tanik rukkar yah nahin sochna chaahate ki virdohi kii aalochana main us tisare paksh kaa kya hoga, jo bevajaah in sabamein apni vishwasaneeyata kho rahaa he, pis rahaa he
 It is true that in these elections, the Election Commission did not show its full strength and in many places its actions have been under suspicion, but this does not mean that it was completely spoiled
 lekin varanasi loksabhaa ke maamle main aisa hi hua dikhataa he
 After the cancellation of Tej Bahadur's nomination from Varanasi, it immediately started trending on social media that Modi canceled the nomination for fear of defeat
 chunaav ayog puri tarah sarkaar ke ishaaron par kaam kar rahaa he
 The Election Commission is completely sold out
 bagaiyrah-bagaiyrah lekin kisi ne un kaarnon ke bare main nahin jaananaa chaha ki jinaki vajah se namakan radd kiya gaya
 On May 9, the Supreme Court dismissed Tej Bahadur's plea challenging the cancellation of his nomination
 ab dekhie or samajhie maamla tha kya, binduon main- When you apply for any government job, it has to be answered, similarly, the same question is asked to anyone willing to contest elections; "have you ever been dismissed from government service on charges of corruption or treason?" Well
 
 
 29 april ko jo namakan daayar kiya gaya, uske liye jo bhi kaagaj kam honge, chunaav adhikari (riterning offisar) agle din hi ummidavaar se kahenge
 On 30 April, the concerned officer asked for the same letter from Tej Bahadur and gave time for May 1, the next day, the last day of the nomination process
 yahaan kisi ko lag saktaa he ki yah to vyavhaarik hi nahin he
 So before concluding, know that these dates are fixed in advance
 chunaav ayog ko isamen kyon pherbadal karnaa chahie tha yaa tej bahadur ko koi chhot deni chahie thi
 
 
 Why? Is this a high-profile seat, so? If the opposition could not find any candidate in such an important election, then Tej Bahadur was the right choice, so why? It seems ridiculous to ask such a question, even if there will be answers! But still we keep asking questions without thinking and destroying institutions, reducing their trust in people
 chalate-chalate
 
 
 Keep in mind that a total of 101 nominations were filed from Varanasi Lok Sabha seat, out of which 71 nomination papers were rejected
 kisi ne is tathy par dhyaan dena uchit nahin samajha
 Time for elections
 chunaav ayog sawaalon ke ghere main lekin is baar supreme court ne yachika kaarij kii he to ise sawaal nahin kiye jaaenge? sochie to jaraa!or haa, ek baat or
 
 
 In the issue of the quality of food that Tej Bahadur raised, i believe that the grievance redressal system works, the redressal of Tej Bahadur's complaint has not been done properly
 aise main ek sawaal or uthta he ki jis vibhaag ne tej bahadur ko shikaayat karne ke kaaran nikaala ho, kya vah use aasaani se NOC jari kar detaa? shaayad haa, shaayad nahin
 In such a situation, another question is whether our election system is as easy and easy for the last person as the claims are made? After all, Tej Bahadur was going to contest elections only under his rights? So there are many questions like this
 ham yaheen viraam dete hai
 At the moment, understand so much that in the present time the Election Commission has acted according to the rules
 isliye is maamle main uski vishwasaneeyata par sawaal uthaanaa bemaani hoga

 usoof ne karachi press club main ek press conference main kaha , ‘maine antarrashtriya cricket ko alavida kehane kaa faisla kar liya he

 This speed was seen more in expensive tickets
 khabaren ain ki log ghar main pade kalaadhan ko safed karne ke liye is prakaar tikat book kara rahe hai taaki tik cancil karakar use white kar liya jaae
 After this action of clever people, the Railways came into action and the Railways made changes in its rules with immediate effect
 rail mantralay ne apane ek bayaan main bataaya ki piares counter se book karaae gaye tikaton ke cancil karne or paisa rifund karne ke niyamon main badlaav kiya gaya he
 The ministry said in a statement that between 9-15 November, this rule will be applicable for those who book tickets of Rs 10,000 or more and cancell them in full or in part
 yah niyam 5000 rupee se zyada rifund maangane waalon par lagu hoga
 There will be no cash payment for tickets booked between 9-15 November from the PRS counter and then for their cancellation between 16-24 November
 aise logon kaa paisa unke khate main rifund kiya jayega
 The railways made it clear that there would be no cash payment of money under any circumstances
 rail unka paisa isies yaa phir check ke jariye hi degaa
 Railways said that the original tick will be given back only through TDR
 yah kaam bhi tidiar ke liye tay samay seemaa main kiya janaa chahie
 It is worth mentioning that the TDR requires that the RAC and waiting ticket must be filed two hours before the departure time of the train and on confirmed ticket it should be done about four hours before the departure time of the train
 tippaniyan The Railway Ministry said that as per the changed rule, TDR and arrears would be refunded only through checks and ECS
 bataa den ki internet se book karaae gaye tikaton ke cancil hone par paisa sidhe khate main hi waapas jaataa he
 Therefore, the government did not need to change the rules related to it
 is liye yah niyam cash tikaton (piares counter se kharid) par hi lagu kiya gaya
 There were reports that people are booking tickets in such a way to whiten the black money lying in the house so that the tick cancellation can be made white
 chaalaak logon kii is harakat ke baad railway harakat main ai or railway ne apane niyamon tatkaal prabhaav se badlaav kiye
 The Railway Ministry said in a statement that the rules for cancellation and refund of tickets booked from PRS counters have been changed
 mantralay ne bayaan main kaha ki 9-15 november ke bich 1 xxrep 4 0 rupee yaa isse adhik rupee kii tikat book karwaane or unhen puraa yaa aanshik rup se cancil karwaane waalon par yah niyam lagu hoga
 This rule will be applicable to those seeking refunds above Rs 5000
 piares counter se 9-15 november ke bich book karaae gaye tikaton or phir 16-24 november ke bich unke cancellation ke liye applai karne waalon ko nakad bhugtan nahin hoga
 The money of such people will be refunded to their account
 railway ne saaf kar diya ki kisi bhi surat main paise kaa nakad bhugtan nahin hoga
 Rail will give their money only through ECS or check
 railway ne kaha ki mul tik dene par keval tidiar ke jariye hi waapas diya jayega
 This work should also be done within the time frame fixed for TDR
 ullekhneey he ki tidiar ke liye yah jaruri he ki aarasi or vatting ke tikat ke liye train ke prasthaan ke samay se do ghante pehle file kiya janaa chahie or conform tikat par yah train ke prasthaan ke samay se kareeb chaar ghante pehle kiya janaa chahie
 The comments rail mantralay ne kaha ki badale gaye niyam ke mutabik tidiar or bakaae kiraye kii vaapasi keval check or isies ke jariye hi kii jaaegi
 Explain that on cancellation of tickets booked through the Internet, the money goes directly back into the account
 isliye sarkaar ko isse jude niyam main badlaav kii jarurat nahin padi
 Hence this rule was applied only on cash tickets (purchase from PRS counters)
