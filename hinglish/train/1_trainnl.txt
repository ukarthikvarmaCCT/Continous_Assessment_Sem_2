 The court will also look at this issue from the point of view whether the fundamental rights of Muslim women are being violated by triple talaq or not
 court ne ye saaf kar diya ki agar ye sabit ho jaataa he ki teen talaak islam dharm kaa abhinn ang he to phir court isamen dakhal nahin degaa

 Rather than three divorces at once, this process takes three months

 raashtrapati baraak hossain obama ke dobaaraa nirvaachit hone kaa matlab he ki aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang america videsh niti kii sheersh praathamikta rahegi
 Obama will continue drones (unmanned aircraft) attacks in Pakistan and Yemen and perhaps open new frontiers of war in North Africa
 obama ke liye pakistan sabase mushkil dwipaksheeya sambandh rahegaa, jise unhen sadhana hi hoga
 They will probably work towards controlling Pakistan

 Since his first election in 2008, Obama has made terrorism the top priority of his foreign policy
 haalanki unhone aatankwaad ke aropiyon ko yatnaa dene par pratibandh laga diya he or guantanamo jail ko band karne kii koshish kii he lekin unhone vaishvik jihad par lagaataar hamale jari rakhe hai
 In early 2009, i chaired a program to review their policy on Afghanistan, Pakistan and al Qaeda and we "disbanded, dispersed and defeated" Al Qaeda in Pakistan and reintroduced it into Afghanistan
 Made a US policy to stop it
 haalanki us disha main kaaphi pragati hui he lekin kaam abhi khatm nahin hua he
 America's relations with Pakistan have been troubling and complicated

 Every day American drones monitor potential targets inside Pakistan
 2004 se 30 sitambar, 2012 ke bich drone ne pakistan main 346 hamale kiye, jinamein se kareeb 300 obama kii najaron ke saamne hue
 The drone has ended al Qaeda's leadership but these attacks have become the basis of anti-us protests for Pakistani leaders including lashkar-e-taiba and Imran Khan
 or phir abtabad kaa saaya bhi to he
 After all, how could the most important target number one, Osama bin Laden, remain hidden at a distance of just 800 meters from Pakistan's main military academy for more than five years? a Pakistani official said that this could be a 'unique coincidence' but can it be believed? a few days after the al-qaeda leader was killed in the Navy Seal attack, a Pakistani journalist wrote that "the generals really knew and knew that he would survive
" yaa to yah pakistani khufia agency iesai kaa nikammapan tha yaa phir uski mileebhagat lekin donon haal main yah baat thik nahin he
 In 2014, NATO will hand over the reins to the Afghan leadership in Afghanistan
 yah america-pakistan ke sambandhon ke liye badi chunauti hogi or bharat ke liye iske kaaphi nihitarth honge
 Obama is committed to a long-term military partnership with Afghanistan, under which he intends to keep more than 20,000 of his troops and advisors in Afghanistan to protect drone bases and also provide assistance to the Afghan military
 agar pakistan taliban ko kabul par apana dabaav badhaane or helmand or kandahar praanton main nato fouj dwaara bahut mushkil se jite hue ilaakon ko waapas lene ke liye uksaata he to iskaa matlab hoga ki pakistan america ko dakshin asia se baahar nikaalane ke liye patibaddh he
 In such a situation, many Americans will blame Pakistan for America's defeat in Afghanistan and they will also have a reasonable reason for doing so

 If this does not happen, then America and India will have to work with each other to keep Pakistan and its army under control

 Proposal to give credit cards to farmers who raise animal husbandry and fisheries, provision of 10 thousand crores for the development of animal husbandry and fisheries infrastructure and Rs 11 thousand crores fund for loans to farmers, Bihar will get the most benefit
 
 unhone kaha ki aath karod mahilaon ko ujjwala ke tahat muft gas conection, chaar karod garibon ko muft bijli conection or swayan sahaayta samoohon ko 75 hajaar karod rupee ke rin dene kaa prastaav bhi swaagat yogya he
 The proposal to give Rs 500 per month for nutritious food to TB patients in the budget is also commendable
 susheel modine kaha ki bajet main varisht nagarikon ke jamaa dhan ke byaaj par chhot kii seemaa 10 hajaar rupee se badhaakar 50 hajaar rupee karne, naukari-pesha vaale logon ke liye 40 hajaar rupee tak standard didction karne va corporate tex 30 se ghataakar 25 fisadi karne ke alaava madhyam, chote evam laghu udyogon ko badhaava dene kaa prayaas kiya gaya he
 This general budget will prove to be helpful in moving forward for backward states like Bihar

 Congress leader Rashid Alvi said that it is very unfortunate that the BJP government is taking action in the matter as the Lok Sabha elections are approaching
 yah maamla pichley saadhe chaar saal kaa he or ab exiaar darj karai ja rahi he
 He taunted that the government had all the wisdom
 Do people not understand this? He said that the public understands everything very well

 Like Pakistan, it wants to put the Prime Minister of the previous government in jail

 Congress leader Alvi questioned whether the opposition within India is dishonest

 RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav is being kept in jail, action is being taken against Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati and Congress leaders
 unhone poocha ki kya bijepi ke sabhi netaa doodh ke dhule hai
 Why action is not taken against them? BJP also counterattacked, reminding the Congress again
 Reacting to the emergency, BJP leader Nalin Kohli said, "rashid Alvi is a senior Congress leader, but i do not understand hearing his point in the matter i am going to laugh or cry? Emergency was imposed in the country in the 1970s and the leaders of all other parties were jailed except the Congress
 sabake sanvaidhanik adhikaron ko nazarandaaj kar diya gaya tha
 The BJP leader questioned that where was Rashid Rizvi when the leaders of all parties were sent to jail during the Emergency? Do they not know what happened at that time? Vadra's business model did not come to understand the country: BJP BJP leader Kohli said that no one has understood the business model of Robert Vadraka in the country
 congress jaraa yah baat samajha de ki koi vyakti bina paise lagaae kisi kii jameen letaa he or phir usee ko waapas bench detaa he

 If the Congress says that there is nothing wrong in this, then they should tell the country
 iske alaava unhone kaha ki neshnal herald cese main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi aaropee hai
 Furious with this, Rashid said that why the BJP did not take action against Amit Shah's son? It was said that the Congress had raised the demand for investigation of the case with great vigor on its own
 jab in maamalon kii jaanch hui or exiaar darj kii gai, to congress kehane lagi ki yah polytical vendata (political vendetta) he
 Now that cases of fraud have come up, the style of speaking of the Congress has also changed

 Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj has given a befitting reply to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
 kaha he ki kashmir ko lekar pakistan kaa sapana kabhi puraa nahin hone vaala
 On Nawaz Sharif's statement that Pakistan will continue to support the people of Kashmir, the Foreign Minister has said that Pakistan has given Kashmir nothing but weapons and terrorism
 pakistan apane gande paise or khatarnaak aatankwaadiyon or sarkari tantra kaa istemaal kar puure kshetra ko asthir karne kii koshish main juta he
 This is what this statement of the Prime Minister of Pakistan shows
 kashmir ghati main aatankwaadi burhan vaani ke maare jane ke baad jis tarah se vahaan hinsa kaa daur shuru hua he, bharat uske peeche pakistan kaa haath maanata he
 Burhan Wani was described by Nawaz Sharif as a martyr
 videsh mantralay kii taraf se bayaan jari kar sharif ke bayaan kii ninda kii ja chuki he
 Now Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj has taken on Nawaz Sharif
 unhone kaha he ki vaani hijbul mujahidin kaa aatankwaadi tha jis par das lakh rupee kaa inaam tha
 He was involved in the killing of elected representatives of the security forces and local bodies
 sushamaa ne kashmir main hinsa ke peeche sidhe taur par pakistan ke sarkari tantra ko zimmedaar bataaya he jo hafiz said jaise yuan se pratibandhit aatankwaadiyon kii madad se is kaam ko anjaam de rahaa he
 Sushma said in strong words that the country which attacks against its own people with cannon and warships has no moral right to point fingers at the professional and disciplined police and security forces of India
 sushamaa ne ye bhi saaf kiya ki surakshabalon ke sanyam kaa saboot is baat se miltaa he ki kashmir kii hinsa main ab tak 1700 ke kareeb jawan ghayal hue hai
 Sushma said that behind this open encouragement by Pakistan to terrorism is the dreaded daydream of Pakistan that 'one day Kashmir will become Pakistan'
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri nawaz shareef ne swayan yah baat kal kahi he
 The whole of India wants to tell wazir-e-azam Pakistan in one voice that this daydream of him and Pakistan will not be fulfilled even by the doom
 sampurna jammu-kashmir-rajya bharat kaa ek atoot hissaa he
 Pakistan will never make this land of heaven a terrorist hell
 unhone kaha, 'pakistan ke pradhanmantri kehete hai ki unki duaen kashmiriyon ke saath hai
 i want to say that Pakistan has never offered prayers but has given deep pain to arms and terrorism
 pakistan kii koshish he ki apane sansadhano, sansthaaon or aatankwaadi sanghathanon ke dwaara jammu-kashmir main asthirataa paidaa kii jaae
 This nefarious plan has been revealed yesterday by the statement of the Prime Minister of Pakistan himself
 main phir purajor dhang se yah doharaana chaahati hum ki unka yah napak mansuba kabhi bhi puraa nahin hoga
 Comments pakistan kii taraf se kashmir par aane vaale har bayaan kaa bharat ne har forum par purazor jawaab diya he
 Whether it is in the UN or on the question raised in Parliament
 haalanki vipaksh kashmir par nawaz sharif ke bayanon ko lekar pradhanmantri narendra modi kii chuppi par sawaal uthaa rahaa he
 He has been calling it a thoughtless decision of Prime Minister Modi's sudden attempt to go to Lahore and make a better connection with Nawaz Sharif
 modi kii taraf se pakistan par koi kadaa bayaan na aane ko vah isi sandarbh main dekhtaa he
 Therefore, such a strong statement from Sushma Swaraj has its own significance
 bharat ne saaf kar diya he ki wo behatar rishte banane kii koshish main pakistan kii taraf se aane vaale bhadakaau bayanon ko nazarandaaj nahin karegaa
 After the killing of terrorist Burhan Wani in the Kashmir valley, the way violence has started there, India considers Pakistan's hand behind it
 burhan vaani ko nawaz sharif ne shahid bataaya tha
 Sharif's statement has been condemned by the Foreign Ministry by issuing a statement
 ab khud videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne nawaz shareef ko aade haathon liya he
 He has said that Wani was a terrorist of Hizbul Mujahideen with a reward of ten lakh rupees
 vah surakshabalon or sthaneey nikaay ke chune hue pratinidhiyon kii hatya main shaamil tha
 Sushma has directly blamed the Pakistan government's mechanism behind the violence in Kashmir, which is carrying out this work with the help of un-banned terrorists like Hafiz Saeed
 sushamaa ne kade shabdon main kaha ki jo desh apane hi logon ke khilaaf top or jangi jahaaz se hamale karata ho use is baat kaa koi naitik haq nahin he ki vah bharat ke peshewar or anushaasit police or surakshabalon par ungali uthaae
 Sushma also clarified that the evidence of the restraint of the security forces comes from the fact that so far 1700 soldiers have been injured in the violence in Kashmir
 sushamaa ne kaha, aatankwaad ko pakistan dwaara is khule protsaahan ke peeche pakistan kaa vah khatarnaak divaswapn he ki ’ek din kashmir pakistan banegaa’
 Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif himself said this yesterday
 puraa bharat ek swar se vazeer-e-ajam pakistan ko yah bataanaa chahta he ki unka or pakistan kaa yah divaswapn qayamat tak bhi puraa nahin hoga
 The entire Jammu and Kashmir state is an unbreakable part of India
 zamin ke is swarg ko pakistan kabhi bhi aatanki narak nahin bana paaegaa
 He said, 'the Prime Minister of Pakistan says that his prayers are with the Kashmiris
 main kahana chaahati hum ki pakistan ne kabhi duaen nahin deen balki hathiyaaron or aatankwaad kaa gaharaa dard diya he
 Pakistan seeks to create instability in Jammu and Kashmir through its resources, institutions and terrorist organizations
 swayan pakistan ke pradhanmantri ke bayaan se yah napak mansuba kal ujagar hua he
 i again want to reiterate strongly that this nefarious plan will never be fulfilled
 'tippaniyan India has strongly responded to every statement coming from Pakistan on Kashmir
 chaahe wo yuan main ho yaa phir sansad main uthe sawaal par
 However, the opposition is questioning Prime Minister Narendra Modi's silence on Nawaz Sharif's statements on Kashmir
 vah ise pradhanmantri modi ke achaanak lahore jane or nawaz shareef se behatar tallukaat banane kii koshish ko bina soche samajhe liya gaya faisla kahata rahaa he
 In this context, he sees no strong statement from Pakistan from Modi
 isliye sushamaa swaraj kii taraf se is tarah ke kade bayaan kii apni alag ahmiyat he
 India has made it clear that it will not ignore inflammatory statements coming from Pakistan in an attempt to build a better relationship
 sushamaa ne kashmir main hinsa ke peeche sidhe taur par pakistan ke sarkari tantra ko zimmedaar bataaya he jo hafiz said jaise yuan se pratibandhit aatankwaadiyon kii madad se is kaam ko anjaam de rahaa he

 He said, "is the blood of Americans blood, and the blood of Indians blood?" Strongly criticizing the attitude of the American administration for its apparent refusal to send Anderson to India
 "sir, Obama in the Gulf of Mexico Your heart aches for the 11 Americans affected by the oil spill, but for the more than 15,000 Indians who died in the Bhopal gas leak, you do not feel that yearning
 obama sahab, aisa doharaa maapdand nahin apanaaie
 Along with criticism of Obama, the BJP spokesperson accused the then Congress governments of Madhya Pradesh and the Center that Anderson was hatched as a conspiracy to escape India

 This time in Bigg Boss 10, Baba Om Ji Maharaj is very much in discussion due to his antics
 is baar ke episod main swami ji kii taang khinchate hue salmaan ne unase poocha ki vah apni divyadrushti se bataaen ki big bos ke ghar se is hafte kise nikaala jayega or hameshaa kii tarah swami ji koi dhang se jawaab de paane main naakaam rahe
 Swami Omji is famous from the beginning because of his bravado
 unhone sho main kaaphi chaunkaane vaale khulaase kiye hai, jinke bare main ham aapako bataa rahe hai
 1
 swami om ji apane bare main ye daawa kar chuke hai ki un par byopic film banane vaali he, jiskaa tital om ji hoga
 Even the family members continue to drag them about this
 2
 Baba Om Jeene taught acting lessons to Bollywood's dream girl Hema Malini at the age of just 11
 ye daawa swami ji ne khud big bos ke episod main kiya he
 Salman caught this thing of Swami ji and while talking to the audience said that Swami Om ji is 59 years old
 hema ji ne 1968 main filmon main debyue kiya tha
 According to this, when Swami would have taught Hema to act, he would have been 11 years old
 3
 In one episode, Baba told Lopa that when you were dancing in front of Salman, a very unique actress seemed
 isi baat par salmaan ne om swami kii jamkar khinchaai kii
 4
 'rock on 2' ke pramotion ke liye big bos ke ghar pahunche farhaan akhtar ke saamne bhi baba dinge haankane se nahin chuke
 Omji told Farhan that he had already told his father Javed Akhtar that his son was going to be very successful
 is par farhaan unase poochhate hai ki aap kab or kahaan mili unase
 Omji then says that i have met him many times in Delhi
 farhaan baat aage na badhaate hue unke guitar bajaane ke andaaj ke bare main unase baat karte hai or swami ji ko vah karne ke liye kehete hai
 5
 'big bos'ke ghar main omaji chori karne se bhi nahin chuke
 He was seen stealing a bottle of Dio during an episode
 iske alaava, omaji kaa monaalisa ke saath pool dance bhi khub surkhiyon main rahaa tha
 Not only this, when Lopamudra landed in the swimming pool with Monalisa recently, she commented - wow kya adaye hain
 6
 During the initial episode, Baba had also told Salman that Salman will get married next year, in response to this, Salman says that his life is going well
 pehali pari 29, duusari pari shunya
 These were the scores of Gautam Gambhir in Rajkot
 pehali pari main 68 or duusari pari main shunya kii salaami sajhadaari bharat kii ore se hui, lekin salaami ballebaazi bhartiya team ke liye chintaa nahin balki yahaan chintaa problem of planti kii he
 Meaning, to choose the best from the options if there is concern
 gambhir ko newzealand series main mauqaa isliye mila kyonki 2 niyamit opebers chotil hue
 At first there was a strain in Rahul's muscles, then Shikhar Dhawan also got injured and passed out
 lekin, ab inamen se ek fit ho chukaa he or gharelu ranjai match main 76 ran kii acchhee pari bhi khel chukaa he
 Lokesh Rahul, playing for his team Karnataka, scored 76 runs in the first innings of the Ranji match against Rajasthan
 ahm baat ye rahi ki andhra ke vijayangaram main unki is pari ko dekhne ke liye mukhya chayankarta bhi maujuud the
 Rahul told MSK Prasad and Sarandeep Singh about his match fitness from this innings
 yahi nahin, rahul kii fitaness ko parakhane ke liye bisisiai ke fizio ko bhi khaastaur par vahaan maujuud rahane ke liye kaha gaya tha
 But, after all this, the big question is whether Lokesh Rahul will return to Team India for the second Test after gaining match fitness? Or he will be given some more time and he will be linked with the team for the third Test
 tippaniyan If sources are to be believed, there is talk of Rahul being included in Team India as the 16th member and there is also the matter of leaving 2 players for Ranji matches, but it is difficult to confirm how much truth is there in these things
 But one thing that can be confirmed is that if Lokesh Rahul joins Team India then Gautam Gambhir could be out of the playing XI
 rahul ke record par nazar daalen to 37
 With an average of 46, he has scored 562 runs in 9 Tests which include three centuries
 vahiin, gambhir ne 41
 He has scored 4154 runs in 58 Tests at an average of 95
 ahm yah he ki pichley 30 test main unke naam ek bhi shatak nahin he
 Gambhir also got 2 Test matches in England against England in 2014, will he have to be out after 2 Tests once again? matlab, agar chintaa he to vikalpon main se best ko chunane kii
 Gambhir got a chance in the New Zealand series because 2 regular openers were injured
 pehle rahul kii mansapenshiyon main khinchaav aa gaya to phir shikhar dhawan bhi chotil hokar baahar ho gaye
 But, now one of them is fit and has played a good innings of 76 runs in domestic Ranji match
 lokesh rahul ne apni team karnataka kii ore se khelte hue rajasthan ke khilaaf ranjai match kii pehali pari main 76 ran banaae
 The important thing is that the chief selectors were also present to see his innings at Vizianagaram in Andhra
 emesake prasad or sarandeep singh ko rahul ne is pari se apni match fitaness ke bare main bataa diya

 Jaiswal should also clarify what he does and why
 'unhone kaha ki yadi rahul, sonia pradhanmantri banaate hai, to manmohan singh kii apni kya merit he? unhen pehle se hi janata remote control se chalane vaala maanati he
 Mishra said that if people follow celibacy to become the Prime Minister, then what is Jaiswal's opinion about Rahul Gandhi? To become a madman, he is roaming all over the country and following celibacy

 His cousin Sule, who was sentimental after Ajit Pawar rebelled from his party on Saturday to support the BJP government led by Devendra Fadnavis, wrote in his whatsapp status that the Pawar family and party had split

 The special session of the 14th assembly to administer oaths to newly elected mlas in Maharashtra began on Wednesday morning
 aaj bijepi sansadeey dal ne narendra modi ko apana netaa chun liya
 LK Advani became emotional as soon as the name was announced, embracing Modi
 phir jab adwani ke bolne kii baari ai to unhone apane bhavuk ho jane kii vajah bataai
 In the speech-life of Advani ji, there are some moments, some moments that he remembers throughout his life and says that this incident also happened
 aaj kaa prasang unamem se ek he
 Like, Narendra Bhai said, Nitin ji said, he has come for the first time in this room
 ye bhi unke jivan main aitihaasik prasang banegaa, bataur piem narendra bhai ko anek baar mauka milegaa yahaan aane kaa
 He can say in a way that i came to this room only after becoming the Prime Minister
 main maanata hum ki narendra bhai ke madhyam se abhiyaan chalaa
 The result of which came two days ago and as a result we are sitting here
 1946 main shuru hui thi samvidhan sabha
 But i am not able to forget that in 1927 this Parliament House was completed
 usee saal meraa janm hua
 Independence gained in 1947
 tab ek hi tamanna hoti thi ki bharat swatantra kab hoga
 India became independent in 1947
 main us samay karachi main tha
 There was a weakness from childhood, i have not yet found an answer
 ek baar readers diguest main artical padhaa tha
 If someone criticizes, praises emotional people, tears come in their eyes
 tab ye artical padhaa tha
 This is an emotional weakness
 lekin he
 i think the episodes from 1947 to the present day
 aazaadee ke dauraan aankh main aansu aae
 Once the Emergency started, we went to jail
 vaajapeyi ji or main ek sansadeey samiti kii meeting ke liye bangalore gaye the
 Arrested right there
 phir jab ye khatm hui to vaise hi aansu hue
 Even today when Narendra Bhai met and i greeted him, tears came
 ye saare prasang aise hai, jo yaad dilaate hai ki jis raajnneetik party ke jariye maine desh seva karne kii koshish kii he, uske liye bhi aitihaasik prasang hai
 Yesterday also the journalist asked
 jab party offis ja rahaa tha
 Why are there tears in my eyes
 maine kaha, avasar aayega to kah duungaa
 i believe that it is the grace of BJP and Narendra Modi that he gave the opportunity to go through all this
 ek baar phir sansadeey dal kii taraf se badhai
 i emphasize that due to the kind of support BJP and Narendra Modi have received, a huge responsibility has come on all of us and we are sure that we will fulfill it

 With the election season approaching in Rajasthan, the benefits of government schemes have also started reaching the people
 uttar pradesh kii tarj par yah phayda bhagava rang main logon tak pahunch rahaa he
 Saffron-colored bicycles were distributed to students in Jaipur, capital of Rajasthan, after which the politics of the state has increased
 bataa den ki jaipur shahar ke saansad ram charan bohara ne jaipur ke sanganer kii ek skool main bacchon ko cycle banti
 The special thing was that the color of these bicycles was saffron, after which the Congress is opposing it
 saansad bohara kaa kahana he ki mukhyamantri kii skim ke adheen sanganer kshetra kii 2000 chaatraon ko cycle baantne ke kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya gaya tha
 Special report: Ambedkar's saffron dress code under Yogi Raj! Congress says that it shows that they are using government property to propagate their ideology
 congress pravaktaa archana sharma ne kaha, 'isse pehle jab yah faisla kiya gaya tha ki bacchon ko cycle banti jaaegi, jiskaa rang kaala hoga, lekin aisa nahin hua
 He was again given a saffron color tender
 isliye yah darshata he ki cycle baantne ke saath saath anya yojanaon main bhi sarkaar or netaaon ko lagata he ki yah ek rasta he, jisase vichaardhaara kaa prachaar kiya ja saktaa he
 'saffron tiles in the bathroom removed after Yogi's reprimand were first distributed saffron-colored bicycles in the state, after which the distance created by the Social Justice Empowerment Department was divided by saffron color in connection with the controversy
 us vakt vibhaag kii taraf se chaatraon ko banti jane vaali cycle kaa rang kaala karne kaa faisla kiya gaya tha
 Indian women's golfer Aditi Ashok carded an over 73 in the final round, putting her in joint 65th position at the LPGA Volvik Golf Championship
 unhone chaar daur main 71-70-73-73 kaa score banaaya or unka kul score ek under 287 rahaa
 The comments is tarah se aditi alpijie main paanch toornamenton main se chaar main cat main jagah banane main safal rahi he lekin vah aakhri do daur main apekshit pradarshan nahin kar paayi
 His best performance so far has been a joint 47th position
 is bich shashaan pheng ne ricard 20 under paar ke score ke saath khitaab jeeta
 He overtook Minji Lee and Sung Hyun Park by two shots
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Aditi thus managed to make it to the cut in four of the five tournaments in the LPGA but failed to perform as expected in the last two rounds
 unka ab tak kaa sarvshereshth pradarshan sanyukt 47wein sthaan par rahanaa rahaa he
 Meanwhile Shashan Feng won the title with a record score of 20 under par
 unhone minji lee or sung hun park ko do shaat se peeche choda

 ) mangalvaar ko desh ke share bazaar taash ke pattonki tarah dhah gaye
 The Mumbai stock index fell more than 850 points, while the 50-share Nifty fell by 251 points, or 3 percent
 bataaya gaya ki antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii keemton main lagaataar giravat ke kaaran aisa hua
 Crude oil prices have fallen to half in about six months
 isse tel-gas kii companiyon ke sheyaron main baari giravat ai
 On the other hand, institutional investors i
e
 fiis investing in India pulled out Rs 1,570 crore from Indian markets
 yah rakam unke lagaai hui rakam se kahin zyada he
 It was previously understood that falling crude oil prices would benefit emerging economies like India, and India would save up to $ 100 billion because we import 75 percent of our oil requirement
 lekin ab iskaa doosraa pahalu dikh rahaa he ki share bazaar iske dhakke se ludhak gaye hai
 Actually this decline is the result of mixed causes of many elements
 yah sach he ki duniya kii sabase badi arthvyavastha america main teji dikh rahi he lekin europe main phir se chintaaon ke badal dikh rahe hai
 Greece's economy is once again staggered and after the election there will be known what will happen next
 europe-japan main arthvyavasthaaon ke dagamagane se bharat par bhi asar padataa he kyonki hamaara export prabhavit hota he
 Also, if interest rates rise in the US, then foreign investors can turn to that
 bharat main nai sarkaar ke aane ke baavjood aisa kuch bada nahin hua he ki videshi niveshak bhartiya pariyojnaon main paisa lagaaein
 Till now, there have not been such concrete indications that large scale investment can be made here
 lekin duusari ore bahut se tathy aise bhi hai jo hamen kahin na kahin se aashwast karte hai
 Falling crude oil prices undoubtedly affected the stock market but it is immediate and the economy will benefit in the long run
 isse rajasav ghate ko niyantran main rakhane main madadmilegi or rupaya sthir hoga
 The second thing is that there is of course a problem in Europe, but we will get the benefit of the boom of the US economy because we do the most exports there
 export badhane se yahaan kii arthvyavastha ko sahaara milegaa
 Another big thing which is a big relief for the Modi government is the decreasing prices of food items
 isse logon ke paas duusari chizon par kharch karne ke liye paise aaenge
 This will be a big incentive for the consumer industry, which is currently facing shortage of demand
 lekin in sabase badi baat he ki is badi giravat ne stock market ko videshi niveshkon ke dhan ke moh se dur rahane kaa ek jabardast sabak diya he
 This decline of the Sensex has nothing to do with its long-term meaning
 yah taatkaalik maamla he or jo dur kii sochate hai unke liye maidan khulaa he
 State-owned telecom company Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited said on Wednesday that it will roll out 3g-enabled mobile market by the end of this year

 67 lakh aadhaar number li hue hai, ye daawa he ki french security research Robert Baptiste kaa
 He has also disclosed the Aadhaar leaks earlier
 medium robert ne ek blog likhaa he
 It said that Indin Gas Agency Indane has leaked 67 lakh Aadhaar numbers
 report ke mutabik dilers or distribyootors ke liye inden kii websites he jahaan se ye data li hua he
 However, this time the claim he has made is from another security researcher who has refused to reveal his identity
 security research ne custom tul ke sahare 11 hajaar inden dilers kaa customer data colect karne kaa daawa kiya he
 This data includes the name, address and Aadhaar number of the customer
 updateaxara li kii is report ke baad indian oil korporation limited kii taraf se ye statement jari kiya gaya he
 indianoil captures only the Aadhaar number from its software which is necessary for transfer of LPG sub-subsidiary
 koi bhi duusare tarah kii aadhaar se judi jaankaree indian oil nahin letaa he, isliye aadhaar data licage sambhav hi nahin he
 Indane has more than 90 million customers in India
 aadhaar kibaat karen tolgbhag 90 fisadi se zyada bhartiya ke paas ab aadhaar he
 The debate over security of Aadhaar has already been going on
 isse pehle bhi aadhaar li ke kai maamle aae hai or ye taaja maamla ek baar phir se aadhaar kii security or prevasi ko lekar dibet shuru kar saktaa he
 However, this third party is leaked, so UIDAI may not say anything on this matter

 Indane has more than 11 thousand dealers and data has been leaked from almost everywhere
 is li se prabhavit hone vaale customers kii sankhya lagbhag 67 lakh he
 Currently neither UIDAI nor Indane has issued any statement on this report
 Robert Baptiste ne kaha he ki unhen ek twitor fulor ne is bare main bataaya, unhone kii jaanch kii
 On 15 February, he told Indane about this
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kii chunaav prachaar samiti kaa adhyaksh banane ke turant baad 9 june, 2013 ko narendra modi ne party kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue ab takiyakalam-sa ban chukaa apana vah vaakya doharaaya jo 2014 ke aam chunaav main unki jeet kaa mantra banane vaala tha or jeet ke baad modi ne vahi baat kahi, "desh aaj jin bhi samasyaon kaa saamana kar rahaa he uskaa ekmaatr upaay he congress-mukt bharat
 "within a year, he really made it come true
 vidambnaa yah he ki ab modi ke netritv vaali bijepi badale hue daur kii congress ke nakshekadam par chalane kii koshish kar rahi he or bharat kii is vaastavik rashtriya party kii jagah lekar deshvyapee party banane kaa sapana sanjo rahi he
 Even during the party's first national executive meeting held under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 3 and 4 April in Bangalore, the BJP continued to try to be the ambassador of the bygone Congress (which was the form of the Congress during Mahatma Gandhi)
 aam chunaav main bijepi ko jahaan 17
 2 crore votes were received while the Congress got only 10
 7 karod vot hi mili
 In this way, the country's oldest party has been pushed to the second position in terms of vote percentage, now the BJP intends to occupy all the places where the Congress was ruled, that is, from every ward of every town and town to every taluk
 To every village
 is lakshya ko paane ke liye bijepi unheen paathon se sikh le rahi he jo bhartiya rashtiya congress ne aazaadee kii ladaai ke dauraan siikhe the, jab vah raajnneeti main apane pair failaa rahi thi
 The road to membership became easier Five years before the RSS came into existence, in 1920, the Congress, which was spearheading the non-cooperation movement, held a session in Nagpur, in which it was agreed that the membership of the party to make inroads in the villages of the country The path has to be made easier
 congress ne sadsyta shulk ghataakar chaar aane (25 paisa) kar diya jisase garib or khaskar gaiyr-shahari log party ke sadsy bane or padhe-likhe sambhraat angreji ke jaankaar logon kii party vaali chhavi ko badalane main madad de saken
 Nearly 95 years later, with Narendra Modi being sworn in as Prime Minister on 26 May 2014, the stage has been set for another party to spread its foot across the country
 beete agast main rashtriya rajdhani ke jawaharlal nehru stadium main party kii rashtiya parishad kii baithak ko sambodhit karte hue bijepi ke adhyaksh amit shah ne apni mahatvakanksha ko in shabdon main jaahir kiya thah "desh kii raajnneeti main congress kii vichaardhaara hi lambey samay tak prabhavi rahi he
 But now the time has come for us to spread our ideology and leave our mark
 "nagpur satr ke baad congress ne jo pehla kaam kiya tha, apane lakshya ko paane ke liye bijepi ne bhi pehla kadam vahi uthaaya he yani party kii sadsyta ko aasaan bananaa
 Membership has been made free and mobile technology is being used to reach people
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pichley saal 1 november ko toll free number par phone milakar party ke sadsyta abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii thi
 BJP claims that till the 35th foundation day of the party on 6 April, 16 million missed calls have been received on this number and around 9
 5 karod logon kaa panjikaran ho chukaa he
 Only 3 of the party till last year
 5 karod sadsy hi the, unke mukaable yah sankhya kahin zyada he
 Earlier the membership drive of the party was to end on 31 March but now its duration has been extended by one month
 party ko ummid he ki tab tak or 10 karod nae sadsy ban jaaenge
 BJP leaders claim that this is just the beginning
 modi or shah chaahate hai ki party kii pahunch gaanv-gaanv tak ho, yah ek aisa sapana he jise aaj tak sirf congress puraa kar saki he, vah bhi tab jab vah apane daur ke sheersh par thi
 Says party vice-president Dinesh Sharma, "as the organizer of the membership drive, i have visited 19 states and by the end of April the BJP president must have visited each state to get registration information and set further targets
 "sahi maukey par sahi kadamfarvari, 1922 main asahyog andolan ke achaanak sthagit ho jane se jab iskaa utsaah thanda padane laga to gandhi ne congress ko jan-jan tak pahunchane kaa vichaar pesh kiya
 He inspired the Congress workers to reconcile with the public and especially marginalized neglected people
 unhone kaaryakartaaon ko bhedbhaav se upar uthakar khaadi, hindu-muslim ekta ko badhaava dene, chuaachhut kaa virodh karne or adivasee tathaa kamjor tabake ke logon ke kalyaan ke liye kaam karne kii prerana bhi di
 On the same lines, in his first address on Independence Day celebrations in August last year, Prime Minister Modi also expressed his intention to free India from open defecation and launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi
 bangaluru main hui rashtiya kaaryakarini kii baithak main bhi unhone yahi lakshya doharaaya
 Shah supervised the event with Prabhat Jha, Purushottam Rupala, J
 pi
 Formed a committee of senior party leaders like Nadda, Vijay Goel and Makhan Singh
 pradhanmantri ne party ke netaaon or kaaryakartaaon se anya saamaajik kaaryon main shaamil hone ke liye bhi kaha he jaise mailaa dhone kii parampara ko khatm karnaa, striyon ke prati zyada samvedansheeltaa laana or nadiyon kii safai
 His loyal ally Shah has set up separate committees to oversee all these tasks
 kanya bhrunahatya rokane or betiyon ko shiksha jaise modi ke lakshyon ke liye shah ne 'beti bachaao beti padhaao' abhiyaan kii ghoshnaa kii he or party ke kaaryakartaaon par inke kriyanvayan kii jimmedaari daali he
 Modi has also emphasized on the cleanliness of other rivers, including the Ganges
 pradhanmantri ne is baat ke sanket bhi die hai ki party 6,000 gaanvon or 1,800 se zyada shaharon se guzarane vaali is nadi kii safai ke liye abhiyaan bhi chalaa sakati he
 When they talk about the benefits to the environment from this program, it is seen as an attempt to take a political edge in the politically important Hindi-speaking states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, where elections will be held later this year and in 2017 respectively
 Are to be
 puraane vichaar nae kalevar menvitt mantri arun jetali ke mutabik saaf taur par mudde ko vahiin se uthaate hue, jahaan congress ne ise choda tha, modi ne bangaluru main kaha ki jansangh ke netaa pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay ke antyoday ke falsafe ke saath chalate hue party ko unke janm shatabdi mahotsav ko garibon ke kalyaan ke liye kaam karte hue manaanaa chahie
 Antyodaya means talking about the welfare of the last person of the society
 jahaan mahatma gandhi kaa moolmantra congress kii deshvyapee pahunch banane main maardarshak sabit hua, vahiin bijepi ke paas apane lakshya ko paane ke liye antyoday mantra he
 Party leaders have been asked to work towards ending the tradition of manual scavenging, while Amit Shah has asked the workers to work for the rehabilitation of the nearly 23 lakh families who continue to carry scavengers even today
 Let's work
 kendriya mantri prakaash jaavdekar ke mutabik shah ne kaha, "aisi gatividhiyaan, jo raajnneeti se upar uthakar saamaajik sudhaar se judi hai, unase hi bijepi anya se alag soch vaali najar aegi
 "BJP, as party spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi says," is not just a political party but an ideological campaign
 samaaj sudhaar kii ye gatividhiyaan bhale hi siyaasi paridrishy se mail na khaati hon lekin gandhi ne aazaadee kii ladaai main inke jariye janata ko jodgaye kaa kaam kar dikhaaya tha
 According to Trivedi, through such programs, the party can better connect with the public and further strengthen its position across the country
 bijepi netritv kaa hameshaa se maananaa rahaa he ki aazaadee ke baad bhi congress kii lokapriyata bane rahane kii sabase badi vajah yah soch he ki isi party ne bharat ko aazaadee dilwaai
 And the second reason is the view that since its formation, the Congress has worked for social betterment
 lekin yah pehali baar he jab bhagava party inhen vichaaron or aakankshaon ko apane shabdon main piro rahi he
 The top BJP leader and his close aide have made it clear how these socio-cultural and political ideas will be implemented
 2 april ko modi ne party ke rashtriya padaadhikariyon, rajya ikai ke pramukhon or rajyon ke sanghathan sachivon se kaha ki ve nae sadasyon ko is abhiyaan main rajnatik kaaryakarta kii tarah joden
 The next day, Shah announced training of active politics to 1
5 million new members
 is vyapak kaarykram main party ke kaaryakarta may se july tak 10 karod nae kaaryakartaaon ke saath sampark sthapit karenge
 But with the passage of time that this ideology will lose its sheen, will the BJP also adopt the path of the Congress, which had defeated many of Gandhi's goals when he came to power after independence? Or, like the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, this campaign will also be limited to being photographed, which was seen in Delhi when state president Satish Upadhyay was specially garbage collected to be photographed while sweeping? It was he who inspired the common Congressmen to work for the good of society and made the party accessible to the masses
 modi sarkaar ke baari bahumat se satta main aane ke baavjood lagata he ki kaaryakartaaon kii ekmaatr naitik jikvamedaari aresas ke prati he
 Modi's plan to connect the masses with the nationalist saffron ideology will depend to a large extent on the implementation of the dreams he has seen in Nagpur
 hairaani nahin ki shah ne in lakshyon ko anjaam tak pahunchane or inaki nigaraanee ke liye jo samitiyaan gathit kii hai, unki kaman bhi aresas ke kareebi logon ko hi di he

 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne 31 july ko twit kiyah ''eitisi ke paanch aadhikarik pratyaashiyon ko aaj rajyasabha ke liye chune jane par badhai or hamaare samarthan se (chune jane vaale) chathe ko bhi
 "it was an innocent tweet to congratulate itself, but if Trinamool Congress insiders believe it is a message for non-bjp parties, especially for the Congress
" bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke dobaaraa bhartiya janata party ke saath chale jane ke baad trinmul congress ke netaaon ko lagata he ki mamata banerjee rashtriya apil vaali ekmaatr vipakshi netaa rah gai hai
 She believes that she alone can unite opposition parties against the Narendra Modi-led NDA in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 trinmal ke ek rajyasabha sadsy kehete hai, ''sansad main hamaare paas kaaphi saansad hai or bengal se baahar bhi hamaari mukhyamantri kii vyapak apil he
 It is true that the number of mps of All India Anna DMK Munnetra Kalgam (AIADMK) in the Parliament is more than us, but the Congress is still looking for a leader and the AIADMK is divided
 ''unki baat main dam he
 Barring two national parties, the Trinamool is the second largest party in terms of number of members in Parliament, having 34 mps in Lok Sabha and 12 mps in Rajya Sabha
 eiediemke kramshah 37 or 13 saansadon ke saath usase thodaa hi aage he par is vakt guton main banty hui he
 And by supporting Ramnath Kovind in the presidential election, he has declared in a way that he is with the government at the center
 iske baad gaiyr-congressi vipakshi partiyon main trinmul hi sabase majboot rah jaati he
 The Biju Janata Dal (BJD) of Naveen Patnaik, which has 20 mps in Lok Sabha and eight mps in Rajya Sabha, is followed by Trinamool
 lekin odisha ke mukhyamantri ko jis tarah se rajya main bhaajapa se muqabla karnaa pad rahaa he, usase is baat kii sambhaavna kam hi he ki ve rashtriya str par koi bhoomika nibhaana chahenge
 a few days after a Congress Rajya Sabha MP spoke to a Trinamool MP, a few days after Nitish's opposition was defeated, "in 2019, the Congress in UP, the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party if Even as we fight together, we will need Mamata Banerjee as a star campaigner
 ''congress ko ekajute rakhane main party upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii baar-baar kii vifaltaa ko dekhte hue vipakshi netaa ke taur par unki sthiti sawaalon ke ghere main aati ja rahi he
 If the political secretary of Sonia Gandhi, Ahmed Patel, does not win the Rajya Sabha elections from his own state of Gujarat, then the party will have to face huge embarrassment
 lagata he, mamata ne congress ke sankat ko pehle hi bhaanp liya tha, tabhi unhone patel ke liye bengal se surakshit seat kii peshkash kar di thi
 But Rahul turned down the offer
 31 july ko banerjee ke twit ke din congress ke ummidavaar pradeep bhattacharya trinmul ke paanch sadasyon ke saath rajyasabha ke liye nirvirodh chun liye gaye
 Mamta's offer could also be a result of political mathematics
 bhaajapa bengal main 2014 ke loksabhaa or 2016 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke mukaable 2019 main kahin kadi chunauti pesh kar sakati he
 There is also cause for concern for Banerjee
 2014 main trinmul ne jaisaa shandaar pradarshan kiya tha, use doharaana shaayad sambhav na hoga
 The party had then won 34 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 baharhaal, mamata vipaksh kii netaa hongi, isaki sambhaavna puri tarah kaalpanik hi he
 Though he may be supported temporarily by Lalu Prasad Yadav, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati, given political mathematics, and Patnaik may also support him, it is unlikely that the Congress will see him as the captain of the fictional ship of opposition Will accept it as badtar yah ki lalu ko chhod den to upar bataae gaye sabhi netaa chunaavon main maat kha chuke hai or ab phir se apana janaadhar banane main lage hai
 The bigger problem for Mamata is the corruption charges against many party leaders
 inamen unke bhattije abhishek banerjee bhi shaamil hai
 The CBI probe into the Saradha and Rose Valley scandals and the arrest of some bigwigs have already put TMC on the defensive
 congress ke ek mahasachiv kehete hai, ''bhaajapa unke khilaaf sibiai kaa istemaal kar sakati he, jisase unhen rashtriya mahatvakankshaayen chhodmai pad sakati hai
 "there is a lack of unity in the opposition, but this camp still has power
" bhaajapa ko 11 rajyon main kadi chunauti kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he—jammu-kashmir main neshnal conference, kerala main vam morcha, uttar pradesh main sapa-basapa, odisha main bijedy, bengal main trinmul, bihar main rashtriya janata dal, punjab or dilli main aam aadmi party, tamilnadu main dramuk, telugana main telugana raashtra samiti or andhra pradesh main viesar congress kii ore se
 These states have a total of 285 Lok Sabha seats
 in rajyon main gaiyr-bhaajapa or gaiyr-congressi partiyaan milakar chunaav laden or congress kaa samarthan paa len to unke vot pratishat or siton main ijapha ho saktaa he

 soshal media par ek tasviir viral ho rahi he, jisamen police ke do adhikari ek aadmi ko pakade hue dikhaai de rahe hai
 The photo is claimed to have caught the South African father's rapist of his three-year-old daughter and tortured her badly
 tasviir ke saath capshan main likhaa he, “sovato ke is pita ne us aadmi ko khoja jisane uski 3 saal kii beti ke saath balaatkaar kiya tha, use ped se baandh diya, balaatkaari kaa ling kaat diya, use pakaaya or balaatkaari ko ise khaane ke liye majaboor kiya
 Soweto is a city in South Africa
 india today ke anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne paaya ki yah daawa galat he
 The man seen in the photo was caught by the South African police for allegedly robbing and assaulting foreign nationals
 yah post is saal april se viral ho rahi he jab twitor yujar ‘zaddy Ajala’ ne ise twit kiya tha
 By the time the story was written, more than 500 people have retweeted his tweet
 fasebukapar bhi kai yujar ne ise share kiya he
 On reverse search of viral photo on internet, we found an article published on 'daily Mail' in which this photo has been used
 lekh main is photo ke capshan main likhaa gaya he, “pretoria kii sadakon par ek march ke dauraan videshi nivaasiyon ke saath kathith rup se lutpaat or jhadap ke baad ek dakshin africa nivasee ko police ne giraftaar kiya
 "this article was published in February 2017, when violence erupted between Black South African citizens and refugees from other African countries in the South African capital, Pretoria
 viral ho rahi tasviir ‘european pressphoto agency’ par bhi usee soochna ke saath uplabdh he
 It is titled there, "south Africa xenophobia"
 jenaphobia kaa matlab hota he videshi logon ko pasand na karnaa
 Thus it is clear that this photo going viral has nothing to do with the African father who discovered the rapist of his three-year-old daughter and tortured her badly

 Its characters are so fake, that it seems as if they have fallen here directly from the magic planet and they have not been able to tell in any hurry how young boys are girls in India, how they talk
 kaise riect karte hai
 Acting has just been handed over to two mothers
 ye upar vaali hot pant maa nahin, smita jayakar or dipti naval jaisi actress maa hai
 Sadly, they too had to spend ruthlessly
 kahani to nahin he film main
 Oh no it's probably
 oh haa, bahut sari kahaniyon ke paband se bana ek taat he
 Look at what is there in it

 There is no acting, so what to tell about lies? par sant kah gaye hai, saar saar ko gah rahe, thotha dei udaay
 So let's talk well
 gandi baat chhodkar
 The music of the film is good
 audio par sunenge to or zyada acha lagegaa
 The t series has also been a legacy of giving a lot of music from the days of Aashiqui
 lokation bhi kuch acchhee hai
 There will be a lot of expenditure on the camera as well
 helicopter se seen lenaa sasta to hota nahin, film bhale hi kitni bhi hawa hawaii kyon na ho
 And finally prayer
 vaise to ye chaar shabd namchin hindi sahityakar udai prakaash kii ek kahani kaa sheershak hai par yahaan aapke liye ek mantra kii tarah kaam aaenge
 If you are going to get caught in the vicious circle of friends, in case of someone's coercion

 Amethi in Uttar Pradesh is the stronghold of the Congress, where only the 'gandhi family' has political sayings
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi chauthi baar amethi loksabhaa seat se aaj namakan patr daakhil karenge
 Like last time, this time also he will face bjp's Smriti Irani
 jabaki sapa-basapa ne rahul gandhi ke samarthan main ummidavaar nahin utaara he

 yahaan gandhi parivaar kii jaden kaaphi majboot hai, tabhi to 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main modi lahar par savaar bijepi camel nahin khilaa saki thi
 The result of this is that in the political history of Amethi, the Congress has had to lose the election only twice

 jabaki 2009 main congress adhyaksh kii jeet kaa antar 3,50,000 se bhi zyada kaa rahaa tha
 Amethi equals Dalit and Muslim voters in Amethi Lok Sabha seat as Kingmaker

 iphone7 launch ho chukaa he or aisa lag rahaa he jaise yphone ke phens android yugers ko nae puraane fitures ke saath ko muh chidhaa rahe hai
 But Android is a platform through which you can do things that are never possible in ios
 google ne android kaa nayaa varjan yani 7
 0 Nougat has been launched and its final version will be updated soon
 philhal nexs smartphone main nugat chal rahaa he
 Nexus users are calling it the best mobile OS ever
 android nugat main kai aisi chijen hai jo ise ios se kai maamalon main behtareen banaati hai
 Turn the OS on one side and on the other hand, in terms of specifications, camera and features, many smartphones are in the market which are far ahead of the new iphone
 camera kaa sabase bada udhaaharan Galaxy S7 Edge he jiskaa camera sabase behtareen he
 Apart from this, Sony's flagship smartphone has a 4K display, that is, in this case too, the iphone is far behind this phone from Sony
 ham aapako points main bataate hai ki aapkaa android ios se kai myanon main behatar he
 Google Assistant: Since Google number-1 in the search engine, so Google Now gives you more information about the work of ios than Siri
 nevigation ho yaa wedar kii jaankaree chahie google nau simple or sidhe tareeke se jaankaree degaa
 Home screen: On the home screen of the iphone, you cannot manage a mind-like app like Android
 yugers kai baar is vajah se bhi pareshaan rahete hai
 Instant Apps: You cannot run an app without uninstalling in ios, but you can use an app without installing it through Android's Instant App feature
 isse aapkaa kaam bhi ho jayega or memory bhi bachi rahegi
 There are many apps that we use only a couple of times, in which case it is of great use to you
 dual sim opshan:bhartiya yugers ke liye dual sim kaaphi myne rakhata he
 Reliance Jio is present in the country with a cheap 4G plan, but iphone users cannot use it because it is not easy to change the number
 unke paas doosraa opshan he ki primary number ko reliance jeeyo main port kara len, lekin agar jeeyo sarvice ke maamle phiseddi hua to phir kya karenge ? dual sim smartphone nishchit taur par single sim se behatar hote hai
 Memory option: You cannot add extra memory to the iphone
 is daur main jab ek photo 10MB or video 500MB kii hoti he aap 16 / 32 or 64GB ke bharose nahin rah sakate hai
 In a few months, more than 50 apps will be added, then the memory of the mobile is over
 aise main yphone yugers ke liye koi doosraa rasta nahin hota
 But Android users can put up to 256GB of memory in their phones
 ios ke mukaable android main customijeshan zyada:baat customijeshan kii he, yani apane smartphone ko apane tareeke se dhaalane kii ho to android kaa nayaa varjan baaji maar jaataa he
 You can't do this even if you want ios
 keemat:is story ko pard rahe honge to jaahir he aap bhartiya yujar honge
 Price is the biggest issue, you have to loose pockets to get a new iphone
 itani keemat main agar hai and android smartphone or smart vaach dono ho jaae to behatar hoga naa?multi tasking:jab baat multi tasking kii ho to android kaa nayaa varjan nugat number-1 hoga
 This is because through the split screen provided in it, you can work in multiple windows simultaneously
 kya yphone yugers aisa kar sakate hai? After bringing new notes of 500, 200 and 50 rupees, the government is now preparing to bring a new note of 100 rupees
 media reports kii maane to agle saal april tak 100 rupee kaa nae note kii chapai shuru ho jaaegi
 According to media reports, the Reserve Bank of India may start printing new notes of 100 rupees in April next year
 yah kaam 200 rupee ke note kii chapai puri hone ke baad shuru ho jayega
 The report says that the design of new notes of 100 rupees will also be similar to the rest of the notes in the new series
 haalanki inkaa aakaar puraane note ke samaan hi hoga
 After the new notes come, the old 100 notes will not be closed and they will remain legal tender like other notes
 darasal duniya ke kai deshon kii sarkarein samay-samay par noton kaa dizin badalati rahati hai
 This is done to curb hoarding and black money
 notebandi ke baad se modi sarkaar bhi lagaataar isi koshish main juty hui he
 The government has also withdrawn 200 and 50 rupee notes
 haalanki cirkulation main inaki taadaad badhane main abhi samay lagegaa

 The bjp's controversy about Narendra Modi and LK Advani seems to be well known
 guuruuvaar ko darbhanga jile se hayaghat vidhansabha se bijepi vidhayak amarnath gami ne susheel kumaar modi (sumo) ko laalkrishna adwani par kii gai twit ke liye aade haathon liya
 Gami attacked Sushil Modi in a very loud tone and said that he has also forgotten modesty
 unhone kaha ki susheel modi maukey kii talash main apana baap badalane main bhi vishwaas rakhte hai
 At the same time, Gami described Advani as the soul of BJP
 unhone kaha ki 'aatma' (adwani) ke bina bijepi ek jinda laash kii tarah
 The Prime Minister lashed out at his own party for Narendra Modi's prime ministerial candidacy and ignoring Advani
 gami se saaf kaha ki party main loktantr nahin rahaa or raja ke ishaare par sabhi bijepi ke bade netaa ke seene par chadhakar piem pad ke liye narendra modi kaa naam bulawaaya ja rahaa he
 Although Amarnath Gami is already suspended from the party for speaking against Modi, he has been speaking on the issue of Danka
 gami ne kaha, 'modi jo twitor par likhe hai ki adwani ji logon kaa nabj nahin pahchaan sake
 i object to that, Sushil Modi ji is opportunistic
 desh ke andar adwani ji ke kaaran hi bijepi ko janaa jaataa he, unke bare main kahana ki maranaasana sthiti main hai or unako pradhanmantri banane kii ichha he ye bada hi khed janak bayaan he
 This is the occasion when the leader Sushil Modi ji came to know that the leader is going to be Narendra Modi ji, the man who used to tell Nitish Kumar as PA material will change so soon
