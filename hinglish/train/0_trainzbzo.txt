 ravivaar ko birmingham main khele gaye isisi cricket world cap ke mukaable main england ne team india ko 31 ranon se maat de di
 After this defeat, questions are being raised on Team India's batting
 khaskar kedaar jadhav or mahendra singh dhoni kii batting par
 Overall, the tournament has not been good for the middle-order batsmen, which has put pressure on themselves
 is match main jab bharat ko apni ran gati badhaane kii darkaar thi, to yah donon hi ballebaaj bebas najar aae
 Kedar Jadhav landed in the 45th over to play Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 us vakt bharat ko 31 gendon main 71 ran banane the
 But the partnership of the two did not work once again for India
 yahaan tak ki aisa kabhi nahin laga ki ye donon jeet ke liye khel rahe hon
 Dhoni (42 not out) hit 4 fours and a six off 31 balls
 maje kii baat he ki team india kii ore se pahaad sa lakshya kaa peechha karte hue ek hi chakka niklaa or wo bhi aakhri over main
 On the other side, Kedar Jadhav hit a four in an unbeaten 12 off 13 balls
 dhoni ore kedaar jadhav kii flop saajhedaari31 gend39 ran7 dot ball20 single3 chauke1 chhakkaengland ke khilaaf in donon kii ballebaaji dekhakar team india ke purv captain or camentator saurav ganguli ne kaha, 'aapke paas 5 wicket hai phir bhi aap jeet kii koshish nahin karte, ye sab mind set bataata he
 Dhoni and Jadhav's batting was also heavily criticized in the match against Afghanistan
 sachin tendulkar ne to dhoni kii ballebaaji par hi sawaal khadey kar die the
 In the match against Afghanistan, Dhoni and Jadhav were able to add 57 runs in 84 balls for the fifth wicket
 us match main pehle ballebaaji ke liye utari team india ko afghanistan kii phiraki ne 224 / 8 ranon par roak diya tha
 However the Afghan team stayed away from the target and 49
 5 overon main 213 ranon par dher ho gai thi
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni's biggest weakness so far has been to rotate strikes less and play dot ball more
 dhoni kii is kamajori ke kaaran bharat kii pari dhimi pad jaati he
 Due to this weakness of Dhoni in the semi-finals and the finals, the team may have to suffer big losses if India does not get a big score
 isse pehle dhoni kii batting ko lekar purv bhartiya ballebaaj vivies lakshmana tippanee kar chuke he
 VVS Laxman said that Dhoni will have to work on this approach
 lakshmana ne kaha, 'pari kii shuruyaat main dhoni kaa strike rate 45-50 ke bich tha
 This creates pressure on the team and the player batting with them

 Michael Vaughan says Chris Tremlett, a 6-foot 7-inch fast bowler from England, performed well against Sachin in 2007
 won ke mutabik tremelet pehle se behatar ho gaye hai or aise main tremelet apni short pich gendon se sachin kaa imtihaan zarur lenge
 Lt Governor Satyapal Malik of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh has said that 50,000 recruitments have been traced in the state
 in padon par do se teen maah ke bheetar abhiyaan chalaakar bhartee kar di jaaegi
 He did not say what kind of posts are out of the 50,000 posts, belong to the fourth category or belong to the middle category
 do se teen maheene ke bheetar bhartee abhiyaan puraa karne kii baat kar rahe hai
 The process of 50,000 recruitments would have been completed within two to three months anywhere in the recent history of India
 lekin tivi par bolnaa hi he to kami kyon rakhi jaae
 The headline will also be made that there will be 50,000 recruitments in three months
 kisi bhi rajya ke liye sarkari naukariyon main bhartee kii aisi praathamikta ho, uskaa swaagat karnaa chahie
 This decision regarding Kashmir has also excited and amazed the youth of those states for which Kashmir has been decided
 bihar-bengal se lekar rajasthan-madhyapradesh or sabase bada pradesh uttar pradesh, punjab or dilli bhi shaamil he
 The population of Kashmir is 125 million, then only 50,000 posts have been vacant there
 uttar pradesh kii aabaadi 20 karod se adhik he
 Is it possible that UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath should also find out the number of vacant posts of all the departments and tell half the incomplete information on Kashmir to the youth on the head
 target de den ki teen maheene na sahi, chah maheene main bhartee puri kar niyukti de denge
 The government of Uttar Pradesh could not complete the appointment of 1 lakh 37 thousand teachers in two years
 supreme court ne shikshamitron kaa samaayojan nirast kar diya tha or kaha tha ki inaki jagah nae shikshakon kii bhartee karen kyonki praathmik shiksha bacchon ke liye ati mahatvapurn he
 All the posts were not filled out of which 68,500 were recruited
 phir 6 janvari ko 69000 shikshakon kii pariksha hui
 The matter has gone to court
 vahaan tarikh badhati ja rahi he
 It has been seven months, the result is not out
 yahi haal anya parikshaon kaa he, jinke bare main alag se likhane kii zarurat nahin he
 i am writing in Hindi so that students of different examinations of all the states consider their problem to be included in this problem
 kashmir kii tarah anya rajyon kii sarkari bhartiyon main bechaini kyon nahin he
 Why is there no restlessness in the examination of the Central Government Staff Selection Commission
 sijiel 2017 kii pariksha abhi tak puri nahin ho saki he
 Lakhs of students were denied examination for photographs only in Railway Group d examination
 unase 500 rupee bhi liye gaye jo waapas nahin hua
 500 rupees were taken in the restoration that was taken at the time of election, when Railway Minister Goyal said that 400 will be returned
 kuch logon ko mila baaki bhul hi gaye
 Rahul Gandhi promised to fill the vacant posts of the central government within a year, the youth did not trust his promise
 unki har baat kaa mazaaq udaane vaali bijepi is baat ko kinare kar gai
 He knew that if he made fun of this thing, he would be exposed and would have to make a new promise
 kair ab rahul gandhi bhi is masale ko bhul chuke hai
 At least they would have taken reports of the examinations in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, and there would have been a chance of going to the youth if they had completed the recruitment within a year
 madhya pradesh main bhi saat maheene se shikshak bahaali ke riselt kaa intazaar ho rahaa he
 It is also true that when elections come, the same youth do not give priority to this issue
 kashmir par inaki jaankaree vahi he jo netaaon ne propeganda ke tahat thama di he
 They are turning it as the last
 netaaon kaa bharosa badha he ki kuch ho jaae kashmir ke kaaran vot to milegaa hi
 Now, if you have not done it for the vote bank, then let the youth of other states also get jobs on time
 noujvaan bhi yah sawaal to kar hi sakate hai ki baaki rajyon main bhi sarkari padon ko bhartee karne kaa abhiyaan chalaa dijie
 Why Kashmir only? The youth who supported the propaganda of Kashmir also got some
 rajanetaaon ko bharosa he naukari nahin denge tab bhi kashmir ne inhen dibet kii naukari de di he
 The governor also has this confidence
 isliye khuleam kah rahe hai ki chunaav main anuchhed 370 ke saporter ko public juute maaregi
 The training to transform the public into a mob has been completed
 aapane dekha hi hoga ki inspector subodh singh kii hatya ke aaropee jail se baahar aae to unka phool maala se swaagat hua
 Now the public who is being murdered as a mob is being declared that she can hit the shoes too
 ummid he ki is public ko naukari dene kaa elaan bhi usee shaan se kiya jayega
 So that the youth get a job and buy shoes first
 phir juute maarthe rahenge
 It seems that the public has become a victim of the government, when it says that it will let two to four people wear shoes
 garv kiijie garv
 You have been able to throw shoes at anyone

 bataaya- kaise safal ho is peshey menmahila ne kaha ki unhone kitaab isliye likhi he taaki mahilaayein is industry main safal ho sake, kyonki is peshey main aane vaali kaaphi mahilaayein aarthik rup se aatmanirbhar nahin hotin
 Gwyneth responded to the criticisms and said - how should i sit quietly? Why don't i share my experience with people? At the age of 18, Gwyneth was gang raped
 is ghatana ne mahila kii jindagi hameshaa ke liye badal di
 The woman said that drugs were mixed in her drink at a club
 unhone kaha ki 6 se 8 logon ne rape kiya tha
 At the age of 21, Gwyneth first worked in this profession
 guineth ne kaha tha- ek baar agar aapako sex ke badale paise milte hai, phir aap peeche nahin mud sakate
 Gwyneth has said that his clients include famous lawyers, politicians and musicians
 jab vah tinties main thim to ek karodpati graahak ne unhen cocaine kaa bhi swaad chakhaaya tha
 Gwyneth said that many customers came to him because they did not feel good in their personal relationships
 29 saal kii umr main guineth ne commercial payalat kaa license hasil kar liya tha
 She then wanted to quit sex work
 haalanki, tabhi guineth kaa swasthya kharaab ho gaya or kidney fail hone ke kaaran unhen flite udaane kii manjuuri nahin mili
 Due to this incident, he had to turn to the sex industry again

 co / awg4s9w2xr Like India, Sri Lanka is considered a paradise for spinners, but looking at the practice matches before the Twenty20 World Championships, it seems that in this tournament, the fast bowlers can speak more than the spinners
 toornament main bhaag lene vaali vibhinn tiimon ke bich 13 se 17 sitambar tak khele gayi das abhyaas maichon par gaur karen to kuch maichon ko chhodkar adhiktar main tej yaa madhyam gati ke gendbaajon kaa dabadabaa rahaa
 In these matches, the fast bowlers took 75 wickets and the spinners took 35 wickets
 bharat sahit adhiktar tiimon ne apane spinneron ke bajaay tej gendbaajon par adhik bharosa dikhaaya
 India used three fast bowlers and two spinners in both their practice matches
 srilanka ke khilaaf match main tej gendbaaj irfan pathan ne paanch or lakshmipathi balaji ne teen wicket liye lekin pakistan ke khilaaf ye prabhavi nahin rahe jisamen of spinner ravichandran aswin ne chaar wicket hasil kiye
 The entire leg-spinner in Australia's spin department rests on the spinner Brad Haag
 unhone abhi tak acha pradarshan karke team ko niraash nahin kiya lekin australia ne apane akraman main chaar tej gendbaaj rakhe hai
 It is the same situation for South Africa that has retained the only spinner as Robin Peterson
 dakshin africa kii newjiland par jeet main del sten ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 He took four wickets for 25 runs in this match
 unhen albi morkal or lonawabo sotsobe kaa acha sahyog mila
 Rangana Herath is the responsibility of hosts Sri Lanka's spin department but captain Mahela Jayawardene hinted in the practice matches that he would be more confident of his fast bowlers Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Kulasekara, Shaminda Eranga and Tisara Perera
 westeindies ko jarur sunil narayan se karishmai pradarshan kii ummid he lekin abhyaas maichon main uske gendbaajon ne jo aath wicket liye unamem se chah tej gendbaajon ke khate main gayi
 Fidel Edwards, Ravi Rampal and captain Darren Sammy are his fast bowling trinity who are likely to play in every match
 pakistan ke paas said ajmal, shahid afridi or mohammad hafeez ke rup main upyogi spinner hai jo yahaan safal ho sakate hai lekin umr gul ab bhi team ke match vijeta gendbaaj hai
 In the practice match between Ireland and Zimbabwe, Irish spinner Alex Cusack took three wickets for six runs in three overs and played a key role in his team's victory but it should not be forgotten that the 13 wickets that fell in this match were ten wickets fast and medium
 The pace bowlers took it
 'maasoom ko goraiya se na prem tha na irshyaa thi

 These are few lines from her novel 'aadhi Stree'
 ham baat kar rahe hai 84 saal ke yuva aabid surati kii
 Abid, born on 5 May 1935 in Rajula in Amreli district of Gujarat, does not need any special introduction
 vah apane aap main chalati-phirti kinvadanti ban chuke hai
 He is called 'father of Indian Comics' for making the country's first superhero comic
 par yah unke vishad, vividhta bhare jivan parichay kaa adana sa hissaa bhar he
 He is a great painter, well-known writer, great cartoonist, great journalist, well-known environmentalist, famous playwright, successful screenwriter and social worker who tries to save water on earth by saving water
 'dhabbu ji' naamak apane cartoon kairactor se aabid surati ne teen se bhi adhik dashakon tak desh or duniya ke cartoonjagat main apni shandaar upasthiti banaae rakhi
 His cartoons have been published in all major magazines and papers in India
 comic kairactor 'bahadur' unheen kii paidaaish he
 His admirers include millions of people in the country besides celebrities like Osho, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Asha Bhosle, Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan
 hindi, angreji, gujarati main unki likhi pustakon kii bharmaar he
 It is said that the story of the film 'atith Tum Kab Jaage' was also inspired by one of his stories
 kabhi dharmaveer bharti ne unki pustak 'kaali kitaab' ke liye likhaa tha, 'sansar kii puraani pavitra kitaaben itihaas ke aise daur main likhi gayi, jab maanav samaaj ko vyavasthit or sangathit karne ke liye katipay mulya maryaadaaon ko nirdhaarit karne kii zarurat thi
 But this important 'black book' of Abid Surti has been written in such a period of history, when the established values and dignities have started to be false and a rebellious thinking is needed from the beginning, so that the pseudo-limitations of the dignities and society and the person Disintegrating the conscience inside, the basis for its reorganization can be found
 mahakaal kaa tandav nrity nirmam hota he, bahut kuch dhwast karata he, taaki nayi maanav rachana kaa aadhaar ban sake
 The same ruthlessness is also in the satire of this work
 'aabid surati aise hi viral kathakaar or kalakaar hai, unki rachanaaen sadiyon se chali aa rahi jad-roodhiyon, paramparaon par jamkar prahaar karti hai, to unki chitrakala main ukeri kunchiyaan or rang unhen kala se kahin behad aage le jaakar is sansar or antat maanavtaa kii behatari kaa khaakaa khinchate hai
 
 
 But Abid is convinced that words and colors do not fill his mind
 
 
 
 He is a well-known face of the campaign to save water in a metropolis like Mumbai
 mjedaar baat yah ki is abhiyaan kii shuruyaat unke jivan main ghate ek itane chote se anubhav se hui, amuman jisaki ham sabhi apane jivan main andekhi kar dete hai
 It happened that Abid Surti was sitting at a friend's house in the year 2007, when his eyes suddenly fell on a leaking water tap in the friend's house
 jab unhone apane dost kaa dhyaan is ore dilaayaa, to unhone is baat ko koi khaas tavajjuh nahin di
 Abid became unhappy, meanwhile he read an article which showed that if a drop of water is wasted every second, then about a thousand liters of water is wasted every month
 yaheen se unke dimag main pani bachaane kii muhim savaar hui
 
 
 
 isi ke saath sar je
 J
 skool of art se shiksha praapt or lekhan ke liye rashtriya film puraskaar jeetne vaale, gujarat gaurav sammaan se sammanit aabid ke khud kandhe par jhola daal pani bachaao abhiyaan par nikal pade
 He has been saving the drops of water dripping from the tap in people's homes since 2007 by running 'the Drop Dead Foundation' campaign
 ek report ke anusaar ab tak unhone apane dam par takreeban 60 lakh litre pani barbaad hone se bachaaya he
 Story collections in Abid Surti's major works - Third Eye, Terrorized, Second Biwi, Ten Representative Stories; Novels - Narrator, Muslim, black book, man and mouse, seventy-two year old child, lost face, black roses, tears of Gulmohar; Drama- Woman examination, radhe-radhe half of us all; Children's Literature- Nawab Rangeela, Dr
 tinchu ke chamatkaar, buddha kyon muskuraae, 2500 saal ke baad or kai anya kitaaben shaamil hai
 Sahitya Aaj Tak gave a long talk, congratulating this unique personality on his birthday
 khaas anshah1
 First of all happy birthday
 is umr main bhi itani urja kahaan se laate hai aap?- main apni urja sakaaratmak soch, yuva peedi kaa saath or- prakruti ke prati sammaan or pyaar se paata hum
 2
 aap kii is srujanaatmakataa kaa akshay strot kya he? aaj jo aabid hai, vah kaise bane? aapaki nirmiti kii prakriya, bachapan se ab tak?- dimag kii khuli khidki, open mind
 With this, i learn something with every step in life
 ek udhaaharan, jise maine osho kii kisi kitaab main padhaa tha- ham apane ko bauddhik, udaaravaadi, na jane kya–kya samajhate hai, lekin jab hamaari shaadi ho jaati he, bachche ho jate hai, to ham kya karte hai- ham apane dharm ko bacchon par thopane lagate hai yaa is baat kaa intjaar karte hai ki ve mechor hone par apni pasand ke mutabik apana dharm chun saken? sankshep main kahuun to maine dharm ko nahin thopa
 Why? Because i adopted Osho's thoughts and always kept my mind open to fresh, fresh thoughts

 Who is your best work and character in this journey of more than 80 books including 'the Black Book', 'musalman' and 'third Eye' from 'tutela Farishta' of 1965 and why? - 'sufi' (muslim), 'kali Kitab', 'seventy-two year old child'
 
 
 
 None, many of them
 kaali kitaab kii baat karun, to uski vishay-vastu, khaskar shaitan kaa charitra adwitiya tha
 Kamleshwar and Dr
 Dharmaveer Bharti both liked it very much
 pehle kamaleshwar ne ise sarika main prakashit kiya
 When it was printed as a book, one wrote its flap case, while the other wrote its role
 yah mere jaise navagantuk lekhak ke liye garv kaa vishay tha, hindi sahitya ke kshetra main isse dhamaakedaar pravesh kya ho saktaa tha
 Iqbal, the lively character of 'sufi', created a never forgetting image in the eyes of the readers
 isi tarah 'bahattar saal kaa baccha' upanyaas jo bacchon ko dhyaan main rakhkar likhaa gaya tha, abhibhavakon ko bhi behad pasand aayaa
 The main protagonist in this book, due to his honesty, credibility and courage, gets covered in the hearts of readers from the very first page
 4
 Story, Autobiography, Novel, Drama, Poetry, Screenwriting
 
 
 aapane in sabhi vidhaon main likhaa? par aap apane aapako kis vidha main sahaj pate hai?- multah, main ek chitrakaar hum
 Through writing and cartoons etc
 i used to get support for my art
 isliye inase koi patibaddhta nahin thi
 But when i got financially organized, i became serious about everything i was doing, especially related to literature - you can call me a committed writer
 mere bare main vistaar se jaanane ke liye pathak utub par mere jivan par bana video yaa meri website www
 ddfmumbai
 com par bhi vijit kar sakate hai
 5
 yah duniya aabid surati ko ek labdh pratishthit painter, cartoonist, lekhak, activist, rangamanch kii damdaar aawaaj ke rup main jaanati he, par aabid multah kya hai? unhen kya hona pasand he?- main jo hum, jaisaa hum, khush hum
 Whenever i want to do it, i do it
 6
 Who has influenced your creativity, and which people? - When i read Sharad Babu's book in college, i felt that someone was challenging me
 bheetar sawaal uthaa- agar vah likh sakate hai, to main kyon nahin? or silsilaa shuru ho gaya
 7
 bataur kalakaar, rachanaakaar vartmaan bharat or vishwa ko aap kis rup main dekhte hai?- buddha kaa main bhakt hum
 His idea is - everything is variable
 ram jaaenge to ravan aaenge or ravan jayega to ram aaenge
 This phase of Ravana is going on
 sirf bharat main hi nahin, videshon main bhi ravan satta main aa gaye hai
 Did anyone even think that two staunch criminals would rule the country of Vivekananda and Gandhi? 8
 srijan ke kshetra main takanic ke prabhaav par aapke vichaar?-takanic vartmaan peedi ke liye sabase bada aashirwad he
 It is like a surgeon's knife
 aap iskaa istemaal apane marij ko nayaa jivan pradaan karne ke liye kar sakate hai or usee chaaku se kisi nirdosh vyakti kaa galaa bhi ret sakate hai
 9
 samaaj, siyasat, kala, sahitya or srijan ke kshetra main khmebandi par aapaki pratikriya?- khmebandi koi nai ghatana nahin he
 It has been a part of our life for thousands of years! You adopt it or leave it, and find a way to keep yourself alive
 10
 Any message for the new generation? What world does Abid dream of? - The new generation should always remember this - what do they want from life - happiness or prosperity? We are born with abundant bliss but if we decide to do Bhagamabha for the attainment of wealth, then the level of bliss will slowly start coming downwards, towards zero
 apana kariyar samajhadaari se chunie, vah jo aapako purna santushti pradaan karata he, amir nahin banaata
 If you are happy, money will automatically follow you
 bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne lagaataar vivaadit bayaan de rahe party netaaon ko aaj kadi naseehat di he
 Modi has tweeted that some people who describe themselves as well wishers of the BJP are diverting the publicity campaign on the issue of development and good governance by their statements
 main aise kisi bhi gaiyr-zimmedaarana bayaan ko khaarij karata hum or is tarah kii bayaanbaji karne waalon se apil karata hum ki vah aise bayanon se parhez karen
 Significantly, according to the news published in an English daily, Togadia had allegedly said at a rally in Bhavnagar, Gujarat on Saturday that Muslims should be stopped from buying property in Hindu areas
 vahiin bihar main bijepi ke netaa giriraaj singh ne jharkhand ke godda main ek chunavi raily main kaha tha ki ki jo log unki party ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi kaa virodh karte hai, unhen aam chunaav parinaamon kii ghoshnaa ke baad bharat chhodkar pakistan janaa hoga
 Giriraj Singh said that those who want to stop Narendra Modi (from becoming PM) are looking towards Pakistan
 aane vaale dinon main unke liye bharat main koi sthaan nahin hoga, unke liye pakistan main hi jagah hogi
 The trailer of Salman Khan's upcoming film Race 3 is making a splash on the Internet
 15 june ko relies hone ja rahi is film kaa trailor utyub par pehle number par trend kar rahaa he
 It has been seen on youtube more than 12 million times so far
 film ke bare main ek dilachasp khabar yah he ki isamen ek seen main salmaan yah bataate najar aaenge ki unhen kis tarah kii ladki se shaadi kerani he
 Salmanfilm's trailer for the first time spoke of the failure of his film Tubelight in a scene in which Salman asks Jacqueline for his hand and when Jacqueline does not do so, she says don't panic, don't ask for marriage
 film ke trailor main najar aae is seen ne pehle hi darshakon kaa dil jeet liya he
 Remember that Jacqueline and Salman were a big success in the film Kick
 is jodi kii saath main yah duusari film he
 Another action-packed trailer of Salman's Race 3, see the dreaded stuntjacklyn Fernandes, praising Salman during the recent trailer launch, saying that whatever he is today is only due to Salman
 remo disuja ke nirdesan main ban rahi res 3 main salmaan or jacleen ke alaava anil kapur, bobi deol, daiji shah, saaqib saleem or fredy daaruwala ahm kirdaar nibhaate najar aaenge
 The film is the third film in the race series
 rajyasabha main lokapal vidheyak paarit karaane ke liye bahumat jutaney se jujh rahi sarkaar kii pareshaani or badhaate hue samprag ke ghatak dal trinmul congress ne kaha ki vah is vidheyak main se rajyon main lokayukta niyukt karne sambandhi praavdhaan ko hataane ke liye sanshodhan pesh karegi
 The Trinamool Congress, which has six members in the Rajya Sabha, made it clear before the Lok Sabha began to discuss the bill that it would strongly oppose the Lokayukta provision
 is party ke netaa or jahazrani rajya mantri mukul raay ne kaha, ‘‘ham is bare main sanshodhan pehle hi pesh kar chuke hai or us par dabaav banaaenge
 “this bill, passed two days ago in the Lok Sabha, provides for the establishment of Lokayukta with the consent of the state governments
 yah puche jane par ki kya trinmul sadsy vidheyak ke viruddh matdaan karenge, unhone kaha, philhal aisa koi sawaal nahin uthta
 Rai said that after the discussion on the Bill is over, the question of voting will arise
 lekin abhi tak trinmul lokayukta sthapit karne sambandhi vidheyak ke bhaag-3 ko hataane kii apni raay par drudh he
 He said, "we are only pressing to remove the Lokayukta provision
" hamen lokapal vaale hisse se koi samasya nahin he
 We are in favor of making Lokayukta in the states, but such states will do it themselves and not from the center
 ’’ trinmul netaa ne kaha ki is mudde ko sulajhane ke liye party ke netaaon ne vitt mantri pranav mukherjee se baat kii he
 People closest to him will also testify that it is not easy to read the mind of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 yah pichley hafte unke mantrimandal main pherbadal se ek baar phir sabit ho gaya
 Nine new faces of the BJP were inducted into the government, six were dropped from the cabinet and considerable changes were made in the portfolios of ministers
 jo ascharyajanak badlaav hue unamem nirmala sitaraman ke liye khaasi tarakkee bhi shaamil thi jinhen kendriya raksha mantri bana diya gaya
 On the other hand, all those rumors were also sidelined that JD (U) or AIADMK would also find a place in the cabinet
 mote taur par iskaa rajnatik sandesh to saaf thah kaam karo yaa hato
 Ministers doing good work got promoted and poorly performing ministers were either thrown out or their stature was shortened
 kaushal vikaas mantralay main rajyamantri rajeev pratap rudi ko saaf taur par is kshetra main pradhanmantri ke sapane ko hakeekat main tabdeel karne ke liye paryaapt kaam na kar paane kii keemat adaa kerani padi
 Three other ministers of state were promoted to cabinet ministers — including Sitharaman, Piyush Goyal and Dharmendra Pradhan
 goyal ko suresh prabhu kii jagah rail mantralay de diya gaya or prabhu ko udyog or vaanijya mantralay de diya gaya
 The newly inducted former Home Secretary in the Cabinet
 ke
 Singh was given Goyal's Department of Energy and Renewable Energy (this was somewhat surprising as Goyal dramatically improved the state of energy in the country)
 lekin modi kaa sabase bada hairaani bharaa rajnatik kadam sitaraman ko raksha mantri banane kaa tha
 She became the first woman to hold the charge of full-time defense minister
 indira gandhi ne bhi 1975 or 1980-82 main raksha mantri kaa padbhaar sambhala tha lekin us samay ve pradhanmantri rahete hue is vibhaag kaa bhi jimmaa dekh rahi thim
 This was clearly a big bet and it is believed that the mathematics behind the performance was less and more shocking
 amuman modi apane har kaam main ek chaunkaau pahalu jod diya karte hai
 Sources say that Sitharaman was given the command of the Ministry of Defense due to Modi's insistence, his own loyalty, honesty and his habit of not advancing from the instructions given
 haalanki party main sitaraman ke aalochak kehete hai ki aksar saahasik faisle lene ke maukon par ve daaen-baayen karti rahi hai
 During his tenure as the Commerce Minister, the Indian export scenario was extremely weak
 haalanki baad ke maheenon main vah thodaa sudhara (vaise kami ke liye unki koshishon ko kam or vaishvik sthiti ko zyada jimmedaar tehraaya jaataa he)
 He performed well in certain circles in the industry department
 yahaan is baat kaa zikr jaruri he ki pradhanmantri ke aise chaunkaau kadamon se ateet main mili-jule nattejey hi hasil hue hai
 For example, Smriti Irani was brought in the same way in the Ministry of Human Resources in 2014, but then her department had to be changed in the last reshuffle
 vaise, sitaraman ke saath kaam kar chuke pradhanmantri ke ek najdiki sutara kaa kahana he, ''unamem teji se seekhney kii kaabiliyat he
 
 
 She will stand up to this examination
 ''kuch log to badbhole aar
 K
 singh ko mantrimandal main shaamil kiye jane se bhi hairaan the
 He was very upset about the bjp's ticket distribution during the Bihar elections and even accused the state's party leadership of taking money for tickets
 lekin bahut kam hi logon kaa yah pataa hoga ki unhone arun jetali ke saath milakar bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko phir se endie main lekar aane main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Apparently, R
 ke
 There will be a strong eye on Singh as well
 kai log is baat ko lekar bhi ashankit hai ki kya ek saamaanya naukarshah urja mantralay ko usee kushalta ke saath chalaa paaegaa jis tarah se navonmeshi goyal ne chalaaya tha
 Meanwhile, the reason behind the shortening of the Lord's height is not only one rail accident after another
 bhaajapa ke sheersh sutron kaa kahana he ki kuch kor kshetron main unka pradarshan paryaapt nahin rahaa tha jaise ki maal or yatri yatayaat main vruddhi na kar paanaa, jabaki safai or khaane jaisi sevaaon par unka jarurat se zyada jor tha
 The best example of Modi's emphasis on performance is seen by the inclusion of two experts who are not even mps
 hardip singh puri purv iesces afasar hai or sanyuktaraashtra main bharat ke sthaayee pratinidhi rah chuke hai
 On the other hand, Alphons Kannanthanam is a former IAS officer from Kerala
 lekin yahaan bhi thodi visangatiyaan hai
 Alphons is a capable administrator who earned the title of 'demolition Man' while being the Municipal Commissioner in Delhi
 unhen rajyamantri ke rup main paryaton mantralay kaa swatantra prabhaar die jane ke saath-saath electronics or ity vibhaagon main bhi rajyamantri banaaya gaya he
 On the other hand, Puri has never worked in urban development but has been given the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs
 puri ke saamne kaaphi chunauti he kyonki centre sarkaar kaa garibon ke liye shahari vikaas kaarykram thik nahin chal rahaa he
 Dharmendra Pradhan was given the status of a full-fledged cabinet minister
 unke paas pehle se maujuud petroleum, tel or gas mantralayon ke saath-saath unhen kaushal vikaas mantralay kaa bhi atirikti jimmaa diya gaya he
 This is perhaps a gift to the poor for the successful implementation of the Ujjwala LPG Cylinder Scheme, which has done wonders for the party's image
 varsh 2019 tak die jane vaale 5 karod bipiel conekshnon ke lakshya main se pradhan pehle hi 2
 Has given 8 crore connections
 ve arase se ghapalon or animitataaon ke liye badnaam rahe tel or gas kshetra main kaaphi had tak paardarshita laane main bhi kaamyaab rahe hai
 Now if they can change the appearance of the Ministry of Skill Development, then their stature within the government will increase to a great extent
 pherbadal main ek badi khoj gajendra singh shekhavat ke rup main rahi he
 These Jodhpur mps have been in a confrontational mode with Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje
 unhen krishi mantralay main rajyamantri banaaya gaya he or iske peeche krishi, saura urja or kalyaan yojanaon main pratyaksh laabh hastantaran (debiti) jaise kshetron main garvanence-sambandhit dikkaton ko dur karne ke unke upayon or saath hi unhen soshal media forum ke jariye lokapriy banane kaa kaaphi yogadan rahaa
 Of course, Shekhawat also has a lot of followers on sites like Kora
 sutron kaa kahana he ki modi shekhavat ke kaam se itane prabhavit the ki unhen pichley sansadeey satr main is bare main bhaajapa saansadon ko ek pregentation dene ke liye kaha gaya
 This is also considered to be a staggering step of the Prime Minister
 jaahir he, pradhanmantri kaa jor kaamkaaj dikhaane par he
 It is known to all that the Prime Minister was not happy with the work of Uma Bharti in the Ganga revival ministry
 lihaaja, is vibhaag ko sarv-kushal nitin gadakari ko saunp diya gaya
 Gadkari has already announced a ministerial task force to suggest ways to speed up the work
 samskruti or paryaton mantralayon ke rajyamantri mahesh sharma se paryaton vibhaag le liya gaya he
 By the way, they are doctors and also favorites of the Sangh leaders (less due to their functioning of the ministry but more due to their medical connections)
 lekin pherbadal ke baad sabase mushkil kaam piyush goyal kaa he—railway ko sudhaarna or kol india li
 Privatizing (they still own) the coal department, which they have failed to tax so far due to many factors, including pressure from trade unions
 unhen yahi chunauti railway main bhi jhelni padegi, jahaan unionen kaaphi majboot hai
 a large number of posts remain vacant due to the dismal security system in the railways
 is samay takreeban 1
 21 lakh such posts are lying vacant
 inamen se zyaadaatar kharch bachaane ke liye khaali rakhe gaye hai
 Then the process of modernization is also very slow
 use tej karne kaa matlab hoga or naukariyaan kam karnaa
 Unions will come in this direction again
 yani chunauti vikat he
 Significantly, the seniority and loyalty of the party has also been rewarded
 nae mantriyon main virendra kumaar chah baar ke saansad hai or vivaadaaspad anant kumaar hegade paanch baar se saansad hai
 Shiv Pratap Shukla has been a four-time MLA in Uttar Pradesh and has been a cabinet minister in the state for eight years, he is an old veteran of the party
 ye teenon hi sangh kii prishthbhumi ke hai
 Therefore, the concerns of the Sangh have also been taken care of
 party main charchaa he ki jetali bahut majboot ho gaye hai kyonki unke sabhi khaas logon—goyal, pradhan, sitaraman or alpsankhyak maamalon ke mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ko tarakkee or inaam mil gaya he
 However, sources close to Modi say that the only base was functioning
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne india today se kaha, ''pherbadal ko chaar shabd paribhaashit karte hai—kushalta, peshewar tath rajnatik dakshata or tarakkee hasil karne ke liye nishtha
 And then keep in mind the priorities of the party and the government

 Modi government, which is under criticism in the context of rising unemployment and job creation in the country, may bring a new employment policy in the budget presented on Thursday
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 se pehle sarkaar kaa yah antim purna bajet he, isliye sarkaar rojgaar ke morche par koi bada elaan kar sakati he
 It is worth noting that only after coming to power four years ago, the Modi government had said that employment should be created as a priority, creating a crore jobs every year
 lekin vaastaviktaa yah he ki sarkaar har saal mahaj 1
 Has created 3
5 million jobs
 ab sarkaar ke tamaam niti-niyantaa ipief ke aankadon ke aadhaar par yah sabit karne kii koshish kar rahe hai ki desh main rojgaar kaa paryaapt srijan ho rahaa he
 Number of unemployed in India 1 in 2018 according to UN Labor Report
 8 karod tak pahunch gai he
 In view of this, the Modi government will have to take some concrete measures towards increasing employment rapidly before the next general election
 sarkaar ko saamaajik, aarthik or shram niti ke dakhal tathaa sudhaaron ke dwaara bahuuddeshiy rojgaar srijan niti or vistrut khaakaa taiyaar karnaa hoga
 There is every possibility that the government will do so in the budget
 niti ayog ne is disha main kaam karte hue isi maheene ek policy paper taiyaar kiya tha
 In this paper several suggestions have been made to the government to increase employment
 is paper ke kuch pramukh bindu is prakaar hai-1

 abhi haal yah he ki aarthik tarakkee kaa zyada hissaa kam rojgaar vaale kshetron jaise vitt, real estate aadi se aata he
 Most of the employment is in low paid sectors
 80 fisadi se zyada form main 50 yaa usase bhi kam karmchaaree hai
 India will have to change its labor laws to help the finance and infrastructure sector
 5
 Around 1 at this time
 23 karod shramik sarplus yani jarurat se zyada hai, jabaki har saal 60 lakh nae shramik aa jate hai

 This native of Kasargod district in north Kerala now lives in Dubai and is a 'middleman' of gold smuggling in India
 is saal aktubar main hi usne desh main 20 kilo sona avaidh tareeke se bhijwaya
 Of course, he does not want to open his mouth about his next shipment, but this much suggests that some 'carriers' (people) carrying his gold at Kerala airports were caught recently, so he would avoid using the state route
 usne uttar kerala ke kosicode main apane daure ke samay india today group kii patrika bijness today ko bataaya, ''main ab rajya se sate hawaii addon jaise coimbattuur or mangalore ko pasand karuunga
 "this resident of Kasargod is actually a hawala agent but he also has experience in smuggling gold
" 1988-89 main jab swarna niyantran kanoon ke tahat sone kaa aayaat pratibandhit tha, vah saudi arab se sona laane vaala 'karier’ kaa kaam karata tha
 On bringing a consignment of 20 pieces of 116 grams of gold, he got Rs 2,000 behind each piece
 kii aamadani ho jaati thi lekin 30 tukade kii khep ke liye vah doguni rakam letaa tha
 With the economic liberalization in 1991-92, import of gold was legally legalized by paying nominal duty, then gold smuggling was not beneficial
 tab vah karency kii taskari karne laga
 But now two decades later, smuggling of gold has started again

 Chidambaram raised the import duty on gold gradually in the current financial year in view of the target of bringing down the current account deficit to $ 60 billion
 yah shulk janvari, 2012 tak 2 pratishat tha, jo ab badhkar 10 pratishat ho gaya he
 Restrictions were also imposed on gold imports
 masalan, utpaada shulk ko 7 pratishat se badhaakar 9 pratishat kiya gaya or aaayaatit sone kaa nunatam 20 pratishat niryaat karne kii baadhyataa tay kar di gai
 These measures took effect and the official figure of gold imports stood at 161 in May this year
 38 ton se ghatakar sitambar main maatr 7
 24 tons left
 lekin in kade upayon ke apratyaashit 'said-effect’ bhi hue
 As Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan himself admitted, "one of the concerns is whether gold smuggling is rampant and payments are made through hawala
" ” unhone mana ki sone kii taskari badi he lekin yah abhi chote paimaane par he
 Like Kasargod, the middlemen are responsible for sending the gold consignment to Indian agents
 vah karier talashta he, use khep saunpta he, uske donon taraf kii hawaii yatra kaa intjaam karata he, seemaa shulk va hawaii adda adhikariyon ko apane samparkon ke jariye rishwat dekar uski surakshit yatra kaa bandobast karata he
 The commission of the middleman may vary
 kasargod ke bascindia ke mutabik vah kul vajan kaa 10 pratishat letaa he yani 2
 250 grams of gold in lieu of 5 kg of gold
 karier se khep kii aapurti bharat main 'landing agent’ lete hai
 They deliver it to retail outlets
 puraane jamaane ke mafia sargana haji mastaan, yaa kareem lala vagairah zyaadaatar samudr ke raste hone vaali taskari main sone kii khep ke 'landing agent’ hi hua karte the, jo 1960 ke dashak ke madhya main sarkari aadesh ke taur par lagu hue sona niyantran kanoon ke baad sakriy hue the
 Dawood Ibrahim was also initially a landing agent
 aaj yah tantra kaise kaam karata he? bichauliya bataata he ki sone kii taskari kaa hawala or mudra taskari se sambandh he
 This business runs with the money of hawala, the smuggler has only a small amount
 taskar hawala oparator ke paise se sona kharidta he
 If the consignment is large, then there is a search for middlemen or else the smuggler himself finds a career
 sone ke taskar, jo zyaadaatar bhartiya hai, khadi ke sabhi deshon main hai lekin zyaadaatar dubai sthit agenton ke jariye hi kaam karte hai
 It is perfectly legal to buy gold in Dubai and get a receipt in return
 taskar agent ke jariye bharat main keemat kaa sauda karata he, ise 'kating’ kehete hai, yah dar sone kii aapurti tak nahin badalati, chaahe vishwa bazaar main kitna hi oonch-neech kyon na ho jaae
 It is also completely legal to take gold out of Dubai
 karier ko sone kii khep ke saath raseed bhi di jaati he, taaki jarurat padane par vah use dubai main hawaii adde par adhikariyon ko dikhaa sake
 If the consignment is large, a certificate of the weight and carrier name of the consignment is also obtained from the Dubai Police
 bharat main seemaa shulk adhikariyon ko chakma dekar yaa rishwat dekar khep landing agent ko saunp di jaati he
 If the consignment is caught, it is the smuggler who takes the entire loss, so it is important that his pocket is heavy
 saudi arab ke jedda main dhandha chalaane vaala, kerala ke kannur jile kaa ek hawala agent kahata he, ''yah mukammal tantra he
 The role of each player is clear and secrecy is also taken
 masalan, karier ko hawaii tikat saunpane vaale vyakti ke alaava kisi ke bare main pataa nahin hota
 Many times even the middlemen do not know who the real smuggler is
 ” aisi saavdhaaniyaan isliye jaruri hai taaki karier ke pakade jane par puraa tantra hi fande main na aa jaae
 According to the resident of Kannur, there are around 200 medium level hawala agents in Saudi Arabia while around 500 in Dubai
 arthvyavastaakoi taskar kitna kama letaa he? ek hawala agent kaa akalan kuch is prakaar he
 Gold prices are up and down
 lekin, maan lijie kisi din sone (24 carat kaa vishuddh sona) kii keemat 26
 30 lakhs
 prati kilo he
 The smuggler gets 'landing price' in India from his Indian partner for around 30 lakhs
 prati kilo tay karegaa, is tarah use prati kilo par 3
 70 lakhs
 munafa hoga
 26 in the world market
 30 lakh ru
 When purchased from the official channel in India, it costs Rs 31 lakh per kg
 se zyada hi padegaa
 Therefore good commission has to be paid at the retail level also
 karier kaa donon taraf kaa kharch, khaskar hawaii yatra kaa, taskar ko hi uthaanaa padataa he, jo 30,000 ru
 Does matter
 iske alaava karier ko prati kilo ke hisaab se 1,000 dirhaam (17,000 ru
 ) Will have to be paid
 is tarah pehle ek kilo kii khep par kul munafa 3
 20 lakhs
 he
 If the carrier takes more than a kilo, then the profit increases because only the extra commission has to be paid
 aayaat shulk badaae ke pehle, jab sone kii taskari kaaphi kam thi, khadi deshon se laut rahe logon khaskar mazdooron ko hi karier ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 But with the rise in smuggling and increasing profits, careers have also changed
 haal main sona jabt kiye jane ke maamalon se pataa chalata he ki isamen striyon kaa bhi istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 Even career work is being taken from families with children and children
 kosicode main ek varisht seemaa shulk adhikari kehete hai, ''haal tak burka pahane koi garbhvatee yaa god main bacchon vaali mahila amuman karier nahin hua karti thi
 Careers who adopt more agile methods now also ask for more commissions
 ab isamen ek nayaa tatv 'arenger’ kaa jud gaya he, jo karier kaa jugad karte hai
 After the recent arrest of women carriers, their demand has reduced
 bichauliyon kaa maananaa he ki aise kariyaron kii giraftaar par media main zyada ho-hallaa machataa he, jo is dhandhe ke liye acha nahin he
 Now there is more demand especially for young Indians from rural background
 kaise chupaaya jaataa he sona? choti maatra to jeb yaa bag vagairah main aise chhupaai ja sakati he ki shaq na ho lekin maatra ke kai kilo hone par alag tarika apanaaya jaataa he
 Police and customs officials believe that a group of 'concealment agents', who specialize in hiding in Dubai, are ready and all of them are Indians
 ye agent immergency lite, washing mashin, wheelchair, bacchon kii cycle, tivi set vagairah main sona chupaane ke nae-nae tareeke ijad karne main maahir hai
 It takes 500 dirhams to hide every three kilos of gold
 kerala taskari ke sone kaa ek ahm thikaana he
 Cities like Thrissur, Koduveli, Vengara are its major centers
 yahaan ke vyapaaree puure rajya or puure desh main sona khapa dete hai
 For example, in the small town of Koduveli in Kozhikode district, there are 200 jewelery shops in a mere 50 meters area
 dukandaar kehete hai ki bharatiyon main sone kii bhukh itani he ki bikri koi samasya nahin he
 a middle-level shopkeeper in Angamalai town says that buying illegal gold not only saves import duty, but also gets rid of 1 percent VAT and other state taxes
 kosicode main ek thok bikreta kahata he, ''jevaraat ke sangathit or asangathit kshetra, donon ke dukandaar taskari vaale sone par ashrith hote hai
 The organized sector consumes about 30 per cent of its requirement from smugglers while the unorganized sector consumes around 50 per cent
 badi dukaane bhi adhikrut kaarobaar se hi nahin chal saktin
 They record the gold from unauthorized channels in their accounts as 'old gold' or 'scarp gold'
 ”iske ant kaa koi sanket nahin dikhataa
 The estimated demand for gold in 2013 was 950 tonnes while so far only 400 tonnes has come from official channels
 yah kami kaise puri hogi, iskaa andaja aasaani se lag saktaa he
 Agents predict that the auspicious days will continue until at least next year's general elections
 aayaat shulk kam nahin kiya jayega
 Perhaps one reason is to bring hawala money into the country easily through smuggling gold for campaigning

 cardiff main buudhvaar ko suresh raina kii karamaati pari kii badaulat dhoni brigade ne mejabaan england ko 133 ranon se patkhni de di
 But you will be surprised to know that there were exactly such views on this ground for nearly three years
 yah ittefaq hi he ki 2011 main bharat or england ke bich cardiff ke maidan par hua vanade kai myanon main buudhvaar ko hue siries ke duusare match jaisaa hi tha
 There is so much similarity in many figures that it is difficult to believe
 lekin fark sirf match ke nattejey kaa tha
 These similarities were in the matches played at Cardiff in 2011 and 2014: 1
 donon maichon main toss england ne jeeta
 2
 donon maichon main england ne toss jitkar gendbaaji chuni
 3
 donon hi maichon main bharat ne 6 wicket par 304 ran banaae
 4
 donon maichon main bharat ke captain dhoni ne jadaa ardhashatak
 5
 donon hi maichon main bharat kii taraf se 1 shatak or 2 ardhashatak bane
 6
 donon hi maichon main barish ne daalaa khalal, dakworth louis niyam se hua faisla
 7
 donon maichon main dakworth louis niyam ke aadhaar par england ko 47 over main 295 ranon kaa mila lakshya
 Despite so many similarities, the biggest difference was that in 2011 Team India lost by 6 wickets, but in 2014 India defeated England by 133 runs
 haalanki 2011 main barish kii vajah se match ko dobaaraa rokna padaa tha or england ko antim lakshya 34 over main 241 ranon kaa mila tha
 All-round seating has been arranged at the Experimental Theater of the National Theater for the Performing Arts in Mumbai

 This unusual arrangement is for Motley's 'most ambitious project', the month-long drama The Father
 francisi naatakkaar floriyaan jailer ke is naatak main andre kii kendriya bhoomika varisht abhinayta nasiruddin shah nibhaa rahe hai
 The play tries to look into the vanishing memory of an Alzheimer's patient
 shah kehete hai, ''koshish yah he ki darshak bhi andre kii dimagi haalat ko saajha kar saken, unhen bhi usee tarah kii bhram kii sthiti main chhod diya jaae
 a few hours before the fourth consecutive production of the play, actor-director Shah was seen holding a hand rolled cigarette

 Rejecting any preparations, he says that half an hour of sleep before the performance is more refreshing

 Shah says, "it may be a little arrogant, but i couldn't think of anyone else for this role
" '' jailer kii prerak script kii vajah se ve har sho ke baad apane charitra ke bare main kuch nayaa talashte hai
 This is magic
 kisi pradarshan ke bich main hi aap kirdaar ke bare main kuch or khoj lete hai or darshak bhi uskaa gavaah hota he
 Zeller, who wrote the play in 2012, calls it a tragic farce

 In Mottley's production, the audience sitting around the stage can create a fear of being surrounded from all sides within the character, but it also gives him a kind of pleasure
 pehle shah soch rahe the ki darshakon ko bilkul naatak ke acshan ke bichobich usee tarah se baithaaen, jaise koi apane ghar ke drawing room main sofe par baitha hota he
 But in his words, "it would have been a little too much
" sabhi darshakon ko isamen samo lene kaa or koi tarika soch nahin paaya
 "his lighting designer Aghrya Lahiri suggested the audience to be all-round
" shah ko pashchim ke kuch zyada hi yathartwaadee set 'moorkhtapurna' lagate hai, isliye unhone kuch kursinyon, ek sopha or ek teble kaa hi istemaal kiya
 If you look closely at the white tape on the wooden floor, you will see the structure of a house, as the play progresses you will understand that there is a living room, a kitchen and a bedroom
 shah kehete hai, ''jaadu is pariklpana main hi he, aap darshakon ko kitna kalpana karne ke liye prerit kar sakate hai
 "similarly, the sound effects are also at the right time
 sharaab kii bottle or cabinet kaa darwaja kholane kii jeevant awaajen naatak ke asar ko or badhaati hai
 Before the play was finalized, Shah had to keep in mind that the audience would be sitting around
 ve bataate hai, ''kisi tarah kii seemaa banane kii bajaae isane hamaare liye kai sambhaavnaaon ko khol diya
 "for example, if this drama were on a normal stage, the actors would stand diagonally in front of each other, but here they could stand opposite each other in the same way as in normal life

 If you are trying to impress a girl, then understand one thing that there are no fixed rules for impressing a girl
 par ye jarur he ki apni kuch aadaton ko badalakar aap kisi kaa bhi dil jeet sakate hai
 Girls do not trust anyone quickly and in today's time, while most girls are self-sufficient, it is difficult to impress them
 pehle ke samay main jahaan zyaadaatar shaadiyaan ghar-parivaar dekhakar kar di jaati thim vahiin aaj ke samay main ghar-parivaar ke saath ladke kii soshal life, arning sorce, luks, intelligence or vyavhaar bhi bahut myne rakhata he
 So friends, if you have not yet understood why a girl does not want to go on a date with you, then there may be a shortcoming in your approach and presence
 aise main aapako ye jaananaa jaruri he ki ve koun si baaten hai jinke chalate koi bhi ladki aapke saath date par nahin janaa chaahati
 1
 kahin aisa to nahin ki aap har baat kaa galat matlab nikaal lete hai
 If a girl is laughing with you, it does not mean that she loves you
 zyaadaatar single purush ladki ke hansane-bolne kaa galat arth nikaal lete hai
 2
 kahin aapke joke moorkhtapurna to nahin hote
 Most men like to listen to porn jokes
 ho saktaa he ki aapke saath baithi ladki ko aapke aise majaak asahaj kar den
 In such a situation, stop listening to useless jokes
 3
 If your words make the girl realize that you are very keen on physical relations, she can still bite you
 sirf itnaa hi nahin aapke prati uski soch par bhi bura asar hi padegaa
 4
 kahin aap ast-vyast to nahin rahete? agar haa toshayad hi koi ladki aapako pasand kare
 Most girls make no compromises with Luks
 5
 Somewhere it is not visible from you that you are very arrogant and just want to run your own
 agar haa to yakeen kiijie kisi ladki ke saath date par janaa aapke liye pahaad todane jitna hi kathin kaam he

 Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has claimed that on the eve of Pakistan's National Day, Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi has sent a message to him
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa ye sandesh bharat main siyaasi vivaad kii vajah ban gaya he
 The Congress and the opposition have bombarded PM Narendra Modi with questions
 congress ne poocha he ki kya sachmuch main piem narendra modi ne pakistan ko koi sandesh bheja he? kya imran khan jis sandesh ko risive karne kaa daawa kar rahe hai vahi sandesh piem modi ne unhen bheja he? in sawaalon par piemo ko jawaab dena chahie
 Explain that in the wake of deteriorating relations with Pakistan after the Pulwama attack, India on Friday boycotted the program organized on the occasion of the country's national day at the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi
 bharat ne kaarykram main jammu kashmir se kai algaavvaadi netaaon ko aamantrit kiye jane par virodh bhi jataayaa tha
 In this context, the alleged sending of messages to Pakistan by the PM came into the limelight
 imran khan ne shuukravaar ko ek twit kar kaha, "PM modi se sandesh mila he, pakistan ke rashtriya diwas par main pakistan ke logon ko badhai evam shubhakamanaayen detaa hum, vakt aa gaya he ki upmahadweep ke log aatank or hinsa se mukt vaataavaran main loktantric, shantipurna, pragatisheel or samrudh kshetra ke liye milakar kaam karen
 "received msg from PM Modi:" i extend my greetings & best wishes to the people of Pakistan on the National Day of Pakistan
 It is time that ppl of Sub-continent work together for a democratic, peaceful, progressive & prosperous region, in an atmosphere free of terror and violence"— Imran Khan (@imrankhanpti)march 22, 2019I welcome PM Modi's message to our people
 As we celebrate Pakistan Day i believe it is time to begin a comprehensive dialogue with India to address & resolve all issues, esp the central issue of Kashmir, & forge a new relationship based on peace & prosperity for all our people
 — Imran Khan (@imrankhanpti)march 22, 2019PM narendra modi kaa yah sandesh pulavama hamale ke baad pakistan ke saath jabardast tanaav ke bich aayaa he
 After the terrorist attack in Pulwama, the Indian Air Force entered Pakistan and carried out an air strike at the jaish-e-mohammed terrorist hideout in Balakot
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke sandesh par tippanee karte hue pakistan ke pradhanmantri ne twit kiya or kaha ki ve piem modi ke sandesh kaa swaagat karte hai
 Imran Khan said that he feels that the time has come to start a comprehensive dialogue with India and resolve all issues, especially the main issue of Kashmir
 iske saath hi shanti or samruddhi par aadhaarit ek nae rishte kii shuruuaat karne kii jarurat he
 As soon as this message from Imran Khan came, Congress questioned PM Modi
 priyanka chaturvedi ne vyangyatmak tippanee kii or likhaa 'vaah modi ji vaah'
 Congress leader Priyanka Chaturvedi said that the PMO should clarify that the message that Imran Khan is referring to is sent by PM Modi
 unhone twit kiya, "mujhe ummid he ki piemo india spasht karenge ki jo imran khan ne twit kiya he wo donon netaaon ke bich aadan-pradaan hue badhai sandesh kaa asli swarup he, kya in donon netaaon ke bich sandesh die bhi gaye hai, khaskar tab jab bharat main sarkaar ne pakistan ke kaaryakramon kaa bahishkaar kiya tha, ye desh jaananaa chahta he
 "I would hope the @ pmoindiaclarifies that what Imran Khan has tweeted is the correct version of greetings exchanged or whether they have been exchanged at all, especially after the function was boycotted in India by the govt
 The nation would want to know

 Following this tweet by Imran Khan, former Jammu and Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah also commented
 umr abdulla ne kaha ki jis tarah pakistan ke rashtriya diwas main shirkat karne ja rahe logon ko roka ja rahaa he usee tarah kuch log pradhanmantri ko bhi pakistan ke rashtriya diwas par sandesh dene se rokte to ham pakistan ke saath sambandhon main itane virodhabhasi nahin dikhte
 But then if he's only following custom it is also custom to send a minister & it is NOT custom to plant spooks & pliant journalists to bully invited guests to not attend
 Can’t pick & choose which customs we like & which we don’t

 In the last three years, the state government has spent Rs 500 crore
 se adhik kii herapheri ke aarope main 42 adhikariyon or 58 gram pradhanon ke khilaaf aapraadhik maamle daayar kiye hai or anushaasan kii karrwai shuru kii he
 Sanjay Dixit, a member of the Central Employment Guarantee Council, says, "the corruption in this scheme is a small sample
" yadi kisi swatantra agency se uchit jaanch karai jaae to isamen darjanon iees, pisies or nichle darje ke adhikari sanlipt paae jaaenge or unhen gambhir sajaa kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 "dixit is an active member of the Congress and hence his views can be considered prejudicial to the Mayawati-led BSP government
" par manaregaa ke rajya parivikshan prakoshth ke pramukh or avkashprapt iees adhikari vinod shankar choube bhi is rojgaar guarantee yojana main badhate bhrashtachar or bade paimaane par aniyamittaaon ko lekar 'chintit' hai
 After visiting several districts, he has recommended making criminal cases on several officers and village servants, deducting their salaries and filing adverse entries in their character registers
 tazatreen maamla sultanpur jile kaa he, jahaan jila str ke adhikariyon ne manaregaa niyamon kaa ghor ulanghan karke gram pradhanon ke liye camere kharide, jo unke kisi kaam ke nahin the
 It is said that in July this year, when Pinky Jowal took charge as District Collector here, the village head started buying cameras in Dostpur and Kudebhar development blocks of some 130 villages
 prayek pradhan ne kareeb 6,000 ru
 Bought this camera
 jile ke ek khand vikaas adhikari (bidio) ne sweekaar kiya, ''hamen pataa tha ki is camere kii manaregaa yojana ke tahat anumati nahin he or uski kendrikrut kharid bhi aparaadh sareekhee he
 But, under the pressure of the said officer, the high-level officer of the district, this purchase was made in two development blocks
 gram pradhanon kaa camere kaa koi kaam nahin he or is samvedansheel upkaran kii bade paimaane par kharid kaa koi auchity nahin tha
 Officially, these cameras were purchased to take pictures of works under MGNREGA to give them a higher level
 pataa chalane par basapa ke ek netaa ne is maamle kii jaankaree mukhyamantri karyaalay or gramin vikaas ke pramukh sachiv manoj kumaar ko di, jinhone sultanpur jile main manaregaa niyamon ke kathith ulanghan kii jaanch kaa aadesh de diya
 The investigation report confirmed illegal purchase of cameras, violation of procurement rules and connivance of top officials in the scam
 anek anya jilon main aisi shikayaton ko dekh rahe or doshi adhikariyon ke khilaaf karrwai kar rahe manoj kumaar bataate hai, ''haa, is report main mukhya vikaas adhikari, bidio or jila vikaas adhikari ko doshi tehraakar unke khilaaf karrwai karne kii sifarish kii gai he
 When asked about the role of Joval, the principal secretary said that it was being investigated
 sultanpur ke jiladhish par aisi kharid kii anumati dene kaa aarope he, jo manaregaa yojana ke niyamon kaa ulanghan he
 All the cameras are said to have been purchased from the same Haryana company, Kumar Ji
 bakaul pramukh sachiv, ''yah kharid main kii gai ek anya chook he kyonki uttar pradesh main camere par waite maatr 4 pratishat he jabaki haryana main yah 14 pratishat he, isliye uttar pradesh se baahar aisa camera kharidne kii koi tuk nahin thi, jabaki vah rajya main sasti dar par uplabdh tha
 The purchase of cameras in Sultanpur is not limited to the MNREGA fund
 maaloom 'aa he ki rifl club ke kosh se bhi aise camere kharide gaye hai
 It is an established tradition that while issuing a weapon license, a hefty amount is transferred from the applicant to the Rifle Club, which is controlled by the district administration and its main role is to conduct shooting practice for the licensees
 lekin vyavhaar main aisa kuch nahin hota or vibhinn jilon main rifl club kii sadsyta ke karodon ru
 The officers grab and misuse them
 sultanpur main bhi rifl club kaa paisa guest house banane or ab camaron kii kharid kii taraf mode diya gaya he
 Like MLA Nidhi and MP Nidhi, MNREGA has also become another source of corruption and looting of government officials
 uttar pradesh main manaregaa ke tahat chaalu vitt varsh 2010-11 ke liye 8,500 karod ru
 Approved, but even after eight months, 30 percent of this amount has not been spent
 dikshit kehete hai, ''main bharose ke saath kah saktaa hum ki uttar pradesh main saikadon karod ru
 The amount of money has been seized and except in action in some cases, Mayawati Government is doing nothing to stop it
 '' unhone kai jilon kaa daura karke paise kii bade paimaane par lut pai he
 Among them is Naxalite affected district Sonbhadra and they have sent the report to the Union Ministry of Rural Development
 apni report main dikshit ne spasht kaha he ki manaregaa se paisa batorne ke liye jila prashasan ne 300 se adhik gaanvon ko naksal prabhavit ghoshit kiya he jabaki tathy yah he ki iske ek-chauthai gaanvon main bhi kisi tarah kii naksali gatividhiyaan dekhne ko nahin mili hai or ghoshnaa paisa paane ke liye jaan-bujhkar kii gai
 After his report, Choubey also inspected the works himself and expressed concern over the misuse of MNREGA money
 Adequate availability of money under MGNREGA scheme at gram level is one of the reasons that the candidates for the village head post this time as compared to the 2005 panchayat elections 20 percent increase
 gat teen varshon main sonbhadra jile ko 700 karod ru
 Allotment of more than Rs 
 1 lakh was made in the state 
 jile ke ek gaanv main to gram pradhan pad ke liye 71 ummidavaar bhid rahe the, jo kisi ek gaanv main sarvaadhik the
 It is clear from this that the village heads have kept their eyes on the money of MNREGA, so there is a tough fight to grab this position
 is baar gram pradhan pad par ladane vaale ummidavaaron ne matadaataaon ko phuslane ke liye lakhon ru
 Spent
 farvari, 2006 main shuru kiye gaye naregaa ne, jiskaa naam badalakar manaregaa kar diya gaya he, gaanv str par vikaas main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai or gaanvon ke garibon ko nunatam 100 din ke rojgaar kii guarantee dekar ek karod maanav diwas srujit kiye
 The scheme became so popular among the villagers that it played an important role in the victory of the Congress in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 isaki safalataa se protsaahit hokar upie sarkaar ne is yojana kaa vistaar kiya or iske bajet aavanton main vruddhi kar di
 But as happened with other government programs like the Jawahar Rozgar Yojana, state government officials are also replicating the scheme for their vested interests
 isaki misaal yah he ki kai jagahon par manaregaa ke paise se sankar bijon ke naam par lakhon ru
 Toys have been purchased and that too on paper
 sabase durbhagyapurna baat to yah he ki yah bhrashtachar zyaadaatar belgaum ho gaya he, jiske chalate dikshit ne isko nayaa naam mahatma gandhi rashtriya gramin shoshan guarantee yojana de diya he

 dhoni ko badalani hogi ballebazimhendra singh dhoni jab ballebaaji ke liye maidan par utarate hai to bade-bade gendbaaj unke saamne gend daalate se ghabaraate hai
 Dhoni's helicopter shot has created awe among bowlers across the world

 aap rajd pramukh ke bete hai
 How much Lalu Prasad Yadav lacks at both the political and personal levels? You can keep Lalu ji away from Bihar, but you cannot keep Biharis away from Lalu ji
 unhen isliye pratadit kiya ja rahaa he kyonki ve saamaajik nyaay or secularism ke liye samarpit hai or bhaajapa inhen donon chizon se darati he
 This is the first election when they are not together
 public meeting main main jab bhi lalu ji ke bare main bolta hum, main dekhtaa hum, log unke liye kitne chintit hai
 Personally, sadness is realized, but we know the reality
 ve rajnatik pratishodh kii vajah se (yah sab) jhel rahe hai
 We know which of these political forces conspired against him but failed to break his will
 aap ise 'rajnatik pratishodh' kyon kehete hai? yah to kanoonee prakriya thi
 
 
 When i went to meet him on April 6, Ranchi was not allowed to meet, no reason was given, despite that it was Saturday which the jail administration has fixed for the meetings

 Lalu ji is there for treatment, but that too is not being given to him
 yahi nahin, prashasan ne unase sabhi milane aane waalon par 20 april se roak laga di he
 Political opposition is fine, but it is inhumane
 mahagathbandhan ke netaa ke naate aapako nitish, susheel modi, ramvilas paswan sareekhon ke mukaable khadaa kiya gaya he
 In this way the beginning is very difficult

 On the ground, RJD is starting with a strong vote bank of 31 per cent Muslims and Yadavs

 Kushwaha, Manjhi failed in 2015
 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ko dhul chataayee thi or vah chunaav mahagathbandhan ne baari bahumat se jeeta tha
 Manjhi is a former Chief Minister and a Dalit leader
 kushvaha ji ati pichhadi jatiyon ke rahanuma hai
 Sahni ji is contesting his first election
 magar nattejey unki kaabiliyat sabit kar denge

 is grahan kii kul avadhi lagbhag 04 ghante 14 minute kii hogi
 This eclipse will be in Sagittarius and Purvashada constellation
 yah aanshik surya grahan hoga or bharat main dikhaai nahin degaa
 Hence there is no need to follow the rules related to sutak
 surya grahan kaa saamaanya prabhaav kya he?is grahan main surya kaa sanyog shani budh or chandra se banegaa
 Due to the influence of Sun, Saturn and Moon, chances of accidents can occur
 saath hi rajnatik rup se bhayankar uthal puthal hone kii bhi sambhaavna he
 This eclipse effect can last for almost one side
 grahan ke dauraan kuch kaam karnaa varjit maane jate hai
 Therefore, do not forget to do these things even during eclipse
 surya grahan ke dauraan na karen ye kaam-1
 Pregnant women are advised to avoid the shadow of the eclipse
 manyata he ki grahan kii chaaya kaa prabhaav garbh main pal rahe shishu par padane se shishu ko nuksaan pahunch saktaa he

 3
 grahan ke dauraan kisi bhi shubh kaam kii shuruyaat karne se us kaam main asafalataa hi milti he
 Therefore, do not do any good work when an eclipse occurs
 4
 Hair comb, teeth cleaning and nail biting are considered inauspicious during eclipse
 5
 Worship, worship is also stopped during the eclipse
 yahi kaaran he ki grahan ke dauraan kai mandiron ke kapaat band kar die jate hai
 6
 grahan lagane ke dauraan kabhi bhi sona nahin chahie
 7
 grahan ke dauraan kisi bhi tarah kii silaai-kadhai kaa kaam nahin karnaa chahie

 team ke lachar pradarshan karne par captain ko kaaphi aalochanaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he lekin bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ko ‘panching bag’ banane yani aalochakon ke nishane par rahane se koi dikkat nahin he yadi isse anya khilaadi dabaav main aane se bachate hai
 The Indian team has been going through a bad phase since last year and Dhoni's leadership is being questioned
 dhoni haalanki har tarah kii aalochana sahane ke liye taiyaar hai
 After India's defeat at the hands of Pakistan in the first one-day, Dhoni said, "I accept all the criticisms
 mujhe acha mahasoos hota he ki main panching bag hum kyonki isse team par kam dabaav rahegaa
 You need some such players in the team who can become punching bags
 sachin pichley kuch samay se aisi bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 They remove all the tension
 main nahin samajhataa ki prayek ko panching bag banane kaa mauka miltaa he isliye mujhe khushi he ki main team kaa thodaa tanaav kam kar saktaa hum
 '' dhoni ne kaha ki aasmaan par badal chhaae hue the or toss ganvaane se lekar aakhir tak bharat ke liye kuch bhi acha nahin rahaa
 He said, "I think to start with the toss
 uske baad unhone acchhee gendbaaji kii
 When the fast bowlers are getting help and swinging the ball, then pitching the ball at the right place works
 yadi aap unke gendbaajon par najar daudao to unhone vastav main acchhee gendbaaji kii
 '' Comments dhoni ne dabaav main 113 ran kii joardaar pari kheli lekin unhone kaha ki is tarah kaa shatak banane kaa mauka milane ke bajaay vah chaahate hai ki unke sheersh kram ke ballebaaj acha pradarshan karen
 He said, "I have not scored too many centuries which i can choose one of them
 mere liye sabhi shatak khaas hai
 If you score a century while batting at number six or seventh in the lower order, in reality you don't want such an opportunity because i want our top order to perform well
 ’’ Dhoni said, "but overall i am happy that i succeeded in scoring a century
" bich main isaki sambhaavna nahin lag rahi thi
 It was necessary for us to hold on to the crease so that we could get a respectable score
 yahi hamaare dimag main tha, yah nahin ki main kitne ran banaata hum
 '' bhartiya team pichley saal se bure daur se guzar rahi he or dhoni kii netritvkshmata par sawaal uthaae ja rahe he
 Dhoni, however, is ready to bear every criticism
 bharat kii pehle van-de main pakistan ke haathon haar ke baad dhoni ne kaha, ‘‘meri jitani bhi aalochanaayen hoti hai mujhe sweekaar he
 i feel good that i am a punching bag as it will put less pressure on the team
 aapako team main kuch is tarah ke khilaadiyon kii jarurat hoti he jo panching bag (aalochana sahane vaale) ban saken
 Sachin has been playing such a role for some time
 vah sara tanaav hataa dete hai
 i don't think everyone gets a chance to be a punching bag so I'm glad i can reduce the stress on the team a little bit
 ’’ Dhoni said that the sky was cloudy and nothing was good for India till the loss of the toss
 unhone kaha, ‘‘main samajhataa hum ki toss se shuruyaat kii jaae
 He bowled well after that
 jab tej gendbaajon ko madad mil rahi ho or gend swing kar rahi ho to gend sahi sthaan par pich karne se kaam banataa he
 If you look at their bowlers, they bowled really well
 ’’ tippaniyan Dhoni played a tremendous 113 runs under pressure but said that instead of getting a chance to score a century like this, he wants his top-order batsmen to perform well
 unhone kaha, ‘‘maine bahut adhik shatak nahin banaae hai jo main unamem kisi ek kaa chayan karun
 All the centuries are special for me
 nichle kram main chathe yaa saatven number par ballebaaji karte hue yadi aap shatak banaate ho, asal main aap aisa mauka nahin chaahate kyonki main chahta hum ki hamaara sheersh kram acha pradarshan kare
 '' dhoni ne kaha, ‘‘lekin kul milakar mujhe khushi he ki main shatak jadne main safal rahaa
 It seemed unlikely in the middle
 hamaare liye krij par tike rahanaa jaruri tha taaki ham sammanjanak score khadaakar paaen

 But according to the survey, 6 with less than one hectare of land
 26 karod pariwaron, yani kul krishi pariwaron ke sattar fisadi ke liye to vah atirikt kamai bhi paryaapt nahin ho paati
 Actually, this survey gives an idea of how big the challenge is
 surveykshan se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki 2 hectare se zyada kheti vaale parivaar hi apane masik kharch se zyada kamaane main sakasham hai
 This shows that large holdings are the only earning option for farming
 pichley saal farvari main naabard ke ek adhyayan ke mutabik, pichley 40 saal main kheti kii jameen kaa ausat aakaar ghatakar aadha rah gaya he-1970-71 main 2
 Less than 28 hectares, 1 in 2010-11
 16 hectare
 Consequently, the number of marginal and small holdings in this period respectively 5
 6 karod va 1
 Increased to 1 crore
 choti joton ke munasib na rahane ke naabard ke is akalan ko disambar 2014 main saarvajanik hue eneseso ke nateezon ne pusht hi kiya he, jisamen kaha gaya ki 2 hectare se bade aakaar ke khet hi kisaan ke upbhog kharch se zyada kamai de paane main sakasham hai
 Therefore, the solution is to ban small pieces of land and keep the size of fields large
 rajnatik varg ko isi par gaur karnaa hoga
 Prominent agricultural economist Vai
 ke
 Alagh says, "the solution will be found only after the farmers unite for collective farming
 soviet sangh kii tarj par nahin lekin utpaadak companiyon kii shakl main
 For this, a limited level of cooperation will be required in which a farmer will not have to give his land but he will have to cooperate in the purchase and sale of the product
 ʼʼrashtriya krishi arthshaastra va niti anusandhan santhaan (ensiapi) ke nideshak ramesh chand ne kisaanon kii suraksha or sthirataa tay karne ke liye krishi bhoomi ko vaidhanik rup se lij par dene kii sahuuliyat ke liye ek niamak dhaancha taiyaar karne kaa suzav diya he
 Laws relating to land leasing of the country are in accordance with the conditions of the time of independence
 iske chalate kai kisaan apni jameen ko lij par dene ke icchhuk nahin hote
 Says Ramesh Chand, "or those who want to take the farm on lease don't get it
 kisaan jameen par niyantran kho dene ke dar se use lij par dene kii bajaae bekaar padi rahane dena zyada behatar samajhate hai
 The challenge for the political fraternity is to prevent further plots of land holdings so that agriculture is no longer profitable

 If the winters of insurance were painful for the farmers this time and spring did not bring them out, then unseasonal rains and hailstorms destroyed about 189 lakh hectares of the total Rabi crop of 606 lakh hectares
 isaki vajah se do maangen uthi
 One, the state governments demanded central assistance
 duusare, kisaanon ne kharid ke maanakon main chhot kii maang kii taaki unki kharaab hui fasal ko bhi bazaar mil jaae
 As expected, political voices raised loud voices: The ruling NDA mps in Parliament kept beating the Centre's request for relaxation in relief distribution standards, while the opposition parties were trying to round up the central government's failure to provide more assistance to the states immediately
 Be engaged
 is rajnatik rassakashi main raahat or muaavje ke bich kaa baarik antar kahin kho gaya
 Lesson for the leaders of the country: If the crop goes bad, the central government provides relief, but the need of the hour is to insure the crops
 yahaan tak ki centre sarkaar ne bhi sweekaar kiya he ki eneseso survey ke nateezon se yah sanket miltaa he ki krishi pariwaron kaa ek behad chota hissaa fasal beemaa kaa istemaal karata he
 To deal with this situation, Ramesh Chand of NCAP insists on making farmers aware that they should pay the cost of insurance to be eligible for compensation
 isamen bhi seemaant kisaanon ke premium par sarkaar sabsidi de sakati he
 However, the Alagh also warns the farmers to chant
 ve kehete hai, ''aap premium kam karne ke liye majaboor karke beemaa companiyon ko barabaad nahin kar sakate
 ʼʼ However they also accept the role of the government in subsidizing crop insurance premium for marginal farmers

 purv krishi sachiv ashish bahuguna kehete hai ki purvi bharat main krishi jot itani choti-choti hai ki kisaanon ko kharid kendron tak fasal le jane ke liye dhulaai kaaphi mahangi padati he
 This allows the traders there to buy produce from the farm instead of mandi (wholesale) and they often make this purchase at less than the minimum support price (MSP)

 Last year itself, there was widespread disruption in the supply of fertilizers due to which there was political outrage in many parts of the country
 purv kendriya krishi ayukta or ab krishi vaigyanik niyukti board ke chairman gurbachan singh kaa kahana he, ''beej or urvarak samay par uplabdh hone chahie
 The need for fertilizers for the Kharif crop should be met at the end of the last Rabi season
 ʼʼbharat krishak samaaj ke chairman ajay vir jakhad kaa kahana he, ''rajnatik varg ko apane hi kushasan se upje sankat par pratikriya vyakt karne ke badale sambhavit maang ke anumaan par dhyaan dena chahie
 If political pressure prevails, coordination will be established in order, ensuring operation of fertilizers and timely delivery of them
 ʼʼrajnatik varg ko kisaanon ke phaayde ke liye sinchai kaa dayera badhaane main shivaraj singh chaihaan jaisi rajya sarkaron se bhi sabak lenaa chahie
 Similarly, to ensure supply of electricity for irrigation and other works, they should look to governments like Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh who have maintained separate agricultural feeder lines for farmers

 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan ne rashtravaadi congress party ke mukhiya sharad pavaar se beete 24 sitambar ko unke dilli awaas par mulaakaat kii
 In the conversation, Pawar pointed to the media reports against his nephew Ajit Pawar, who is also the Deputy Chief Minister in the state
 ishaara saaf tha: pavaar maan kar chal rahe the ki ye khabaren media main chavaan ne hi li kii hai
 Chavan also took it lightly and replied that in the era of right to information, nothing is confidential
 choubees ghante ke andar hi jab chavaan pune jane ke liye mumbai airport par the tabhi unke daftar main ek chitthee ai jo unke pradhan sachiv e
 K
 jain ko mili
 This was Ajit Pawar's resignation
 ghante bhar baad rajya sarkaar main shaamil ensipi ke baaki 19 mantriyon ne bhi apane istife chavaan ko nahin, balki ensipi rajya ikai ke adhyaksh madhukar pichad ko saunp die
 a day later, 16 independent mlas supporting the government clearly stated that they will continue to support only when Ajit Pawar remains in the cabinet
 iske peeche koun tha yah jaahir tha
 Sharad Pawar was definitely not playing this game
 apane istife ke turant baad mumbai sthit mantralay main ek press conference kar ajit pavaar ne kaha ki unhone istipha isliye diya he taaki karodon ru
 They could not influence the ongoing investigation against them in the irrigation scam
 un par aarope he ki 1999 se 2009 ke bich jal sansaadhan mantri rahete hue 20,000 karod ru
 He had done irregularities in sanctioning the irrigation projects of the state and by distorting the rules, tenders of these projects were issued without getting the necessary approval from the administrative unit of Vidarbha Irrigation Development Council
 is saal may main mukhyamantri ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki ve ghotaale par shwet patr laaenge jisamen us avadhi kii jaanch kii maang hogi jab ajit pavaar mantri the
 Ajit Pawar was further infuriated when the documents related to the charge were leaked selectively to a national daily
 ensipi kaaryakartaaon ne iske liye mukhyamantri karyaalay ko doshi tehraaya
 Ajit Pawar said that his decisions were within the legal purview
 mantralay main patrakaron se unhone kaha, ‘‘main filon ko atakane main vishwaas nahin karata
 Therefore, i cleared the projects on the demand of opposition parties
 rajyapal kii ore se mantri ko pariyojnaayen manjuur karne ke vishesh adhikaar mili hue hai
 Ajit Pawar said he would not withdraw his resignation until the white paper was released and the allegations against him were not erased
 haalanki jaanch pichley chaar maah se jari he, phir sawaal uthta he ki ajit pavaar ne apane gathbandhan sahyogi se rishta todgaye main itnaa vakt kyon liya? ek vajah to yah he ki unka istipha congress ke liye jitani badi chunauti he, utani hi badi chetavanee unke chachaa sharad pavaar ke liye bhi he
 Ever since Sharad Pawar started hinting that his political successor would be his daughter Supriya Sule, Ajit Pawar had been trying to establish his supremacy over the party which to some extent succeeded him
 ensipi ke 62 vidhayakon main se 50 kii aasthaa sharad pavaar ke saath nahin, ajit ke saath he
 Perhaps thinking this, Sharad Pawar brought his daughter to Delhi and gave up her favorite Baramati Lok Sabha seat for him
 ensipi ke ek saansad kehete hai, ‘‘donon kaa ilaaka hameshaa se banta rahaa he
 Supriya is at the center and Ajit in the state
 ’’ is saal june main sharad pavaar ne ensipi kii aadhikarik mahila ikai rashtravaadi yuvati congress kaa gathan kiya jiskaa adhyaksh supriya ko banaaya
 Sule rallied several Lok Sabha seats in the state under its banner and tried to reach the ground level
 rajya ke ek congressi vidhayak kehete hai, ‘‘iske gathan ke vakt sharad pavaar ne mayawati jaisi netriyon kii takat kaa bakhaan kiya
 This made it seem like they are promoting Supriya as an alternative to Ajit
 ’’ yah baat or saaf tab ho gai jab sharad pavaar ne 21 sitambar ko yashwantrao chavaan pratishthan trust ke adhyaksh kii kursi bitiyaa ke liye khaali kar di
 Ajit Pawar, however, says this on the record, "pawar vs Pawar is the media
 sahib (sharad pavaar) ko hamane antim faisla lene kaa puraa adhikaar diya he
 There are no differences
 ’’aisi atakalon par sule sabase pehle lagaam lagaati hai
 She calls Ajit Pawar a grandfather
 unka daawa he ki ve donon roj baat karte hai
 Asked what happens between them, he said, "it is a conversation between brother and sister
" aapako ise jaanane kii jarurat nahin he
 "there is a difference of ground-sky among these cousins
" shandaar paridhaan pahanane vaali aakarshak sule ko prachaar se parhez nahin he
 She is building her image of a woman who is concerned about women's rights, education and malnutrition
 tivi par khubasurat dikhne vaali sule aajkal vibhinn masalon par media ko ensipi kaa paksh samajhati najar aati hai
 Unlike him, the presence of 53-year-old Ajit is also not known
 raajnneeti main aane se pehle ve doodh or poltry kaa khandaani kaarobaar dekhte the
 Their conversation is blunt
 2010 main up-mukhyamantri banane ke baad unhone angreji seekhney kii koshish bhi shuru kii thi, lekin jald hi haath khadey kar die
 There is no direct difference between these siblings
 2009 main congress ne jab ashok chavaan ko mukhyamantri banaaya tha to sharad pavaar ne bhattije ajit kii upeksha karte hue up-mukhyamantri kii ummidavaari ke liye ensipi kii ore se chagan bhujabal kaa naam chunaa tha
 In 2010, when the Congress replaced Prithviraj Chavan as Ashok Chavan, Ajit showed his strength with the support of the mlas and persuaded Sharad Pawar for his candidature
 sharad pavaar ne ensipi ke mantriyon ke samuhik istifon ko zyada mahatv na dete hue media se kaha, ‘‘aise halaat main meri party ke kaaryakarta mere liye bhi yahi karte
 He also said that the state government is stable
 haalanki samuhik istife kaa naatak rach ajit pavaar ne saaf kar diya he ki unke chachaa sarkaar ke sthir hone kaa chaahe jitna bhi daawa kar len, aisa he nahin
 Sharad Pawar has asked Prithviraj to accept Ajit's resignation
 unhone yah kah kar ki ensipi ab upmukhyamantri pad par apana ummidavaar khadaa nahin karegaa, ek tarah se ajit pavaar kii takat ko maan liya he
 Ajit Pawar has not resigned from the NCP legislature party yet
 unhone to apane istife se khaali hue do mantralayon-vitt or urja ke liye do naam bhi aage badha die hai
 This is important because the work of distributing ministership comes under Sharad Pawar's jurisdiction
 party sutara ishaare main kehete hai ki congress ke khilaaf pichley dinon ensipi kii baghawat ke phuss ho jane se ajit hataash hai
 Keep in mind that in August this year, Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel resigned from the Union Cabinet saying that the Congress had treated them poorly in both Maharashtra and Delhi
 ajit is sthiti kaa phayda uthaa kar lagaataar mukhyamantri badalane kaa dabaav bana rahe the, lekin sharad pavaar ne unki maang ko taarkik nishkarsh tak nahin pahunchane diya
 Ajit hoped that Chavan would be called to Delhi in the wake of the pending cabinet reshuffle, but on September 24, during his visit to Delhi, Chavan met Sonia Gandhi and took his blessing that his chair would be safe
 ajit pavaar ko ummid thi ki apni raajnneetik aakraamakata se ve sajjan prithviraj se paar paa lenge, lekin ve galat sabit hue
 10 Janpath has a hand over Chavan and it was his strength to climb on his deputy chief minister
 unhone sitambar 2011 main maharashtra rajya sahakaari bank main prashaskon kii niyukti kar ajit ke paise kamaane ke sroton par hi chot kar di
 This led to control of the funds of the banks from Ajit Pawar
 ab ajit ne palatwaar kiya he
 Both Sharad Pawar and Chavan know that Ajit has so much power that the hands of both of them can move the kingdom
 ab har kisi ko shwet patr kaa intjaar he
 Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad gave the example of three films on the bad state of the economy
 unhone kaha tha ki 2 oktober ko relies hui teen filmon ne 120 karod kaa bijness kiya he
 Now the economy is slow in the country only then so much business is coming
 ravishankar ne film trade analist komal nahata ke aankadon ke sahare ye baat kahi thi
 When asked about this, Komal Nahata said that the film industry does not support the Indian economy
 komal nahata ne india today se baatcheet main kaha, kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad filmon kii kamai ke maamle main to bilkul sahi the or yah pehali baar he jab filmon ne 120 karod rupye ek din main kamaaye the

 In Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka we are feeling the right conditions and we are enjoying our game of cricket
 abhi tak hamane acha cricket khelaa he

 There will be comparisons and many still remember the glowing days of Gary Sobers, Clive Lloyd and Vivian Richards

 pyaar kaa din, pyaar ke izhaar kaa din
 Perhaps every beating heart of this day waits eagerly to express its feelings in words
 ham baat kar rahe hai pyaar ke paravaanon ke din kii yani‘velentine-de’kii
 This day, celebrated on 14 February, is celebrated in different countries with different style and belief
 jahaan china main yah din ‘nits of sevens’ ke naam se manaaya jaataa he, vahiin japan or korea main is din ko 'white de' kaa naam se janaa jaataa he
 Not only this, in these countries from this day to the whole month, people express their love and express their feelings by giving gifts and flowers to each other
 pashchimi deshon main paaramparik rup se ise manaane ke liye ‘velentaines-de’ ke naam se card aadan-pradaan to kiya hi jaataa he, saath hi dil, kupid, phulon or greeting cardon jaise prem ke chihnon ko uphaar swaroop dekar apni bhaawanaaon kaa bhi izhaar kiya jaataa he
 How was it named 'valentine's Day' It is believed that 'valentine's Day' is named after Saint Valentine, but do you know that the special day of those who love 'valentine's Day' is named after Saint Valentine Why the name? No, then let us tell you
 darasal rome main teesri sadi main clodias naam ke raja kaa raaj hua karata tha
 Claudius believed that by marrying, the power and wisdom of men ceased
 isi ke chalate usne puure rajya main yah aadesh jari kar diya ki uskaa koi bhi sainik yaa adhikari shaadi nahin karegaa
 But Saint Valentine protested strongly against this order of Claudius and prompted people across the state to marry
 sant velentine ne anek sainikon or adhikariyon kaa vivaah karavaaya
 Seeing opposition to his order, Claudius finally executed Saint Valentine on February 14, 269
 tab se unki yaad main yah din manaaya jane laga
 What to do on Valentine's Day ‘velentine de’ aisa din hota he, jis din premi or premika ke bich pal rahe pyaar ko or nazdikiyaan mil jaati hai
 Everyone wants to know how to add more sweetness to love
 ham aapako bataa rahe hai aise tips, jisase aapke pyaar bhare rishton main or garmaahat aa jaaegi
 2
 velentine de ke din apane bedroom ko ‘velentine theme’ den
 That means, put a red sheet on the bed, put a heart shaped pillow on top of it and keep white and red color sheet to cover it
 agar ‘madhoshi’ main khone ke shaukeen hai, to sangeet sunate hue ‘red wine’ kaa majaa len
 As much as possible, give love to your girlfriend and remember the moments of love that are memorable for you
 velentine de par apane prem ko kya or kaise den giftpyar kaa sailaab aap donon ke dil main chhalak aae, iske liye jaruri he ki is maukey par kuch nayab tohfon kaa bhi aadan-pradaan kar liya jaae
 The message reached from the heart reaches the heart properly, for this, not only every time, but many times it goes through your 'pocket'
 kehane kaa matlab yah he ki gift ke maamle main kotahi bilkul na karen
 So here are some select ideas about gifts
 
 
 1
 Beautifully decorate your partner's gift items on a single board, such as a calendar or gifted candy toffee
 yaa phir ek saath dekhi kisi movie kaa tikat ho
 This will make you remember all those moments spent with your girlfriend, which have become memorable for your life
 isse badhiya kuch nahin ho saktaa he ki aap unpar us tarikhon kaa zikr kar den, jis din vah gift aapako mila
 There is no better gift for a girlfriend than a lover
 2
 If you want, you buy a pendulum and cut it into two pieces
 ek tukdaa premika ko den or doosraa khud hi pahan len
 You can also write each other's names on the pendulum
 yah na sirf aapaki premika ke liye, balki aapke liye bhi na bhuulane vaala gift hoga
 3
 ‘velentaines de’ ke din apni premika ko ek acha sa parafum bhent karen or us par likh den- ‘main is parafum kii khushboo tumhaare jism par mahasoos karnaa chahta hum
 With the help of this message, you will be able to make him realize that your life is nothing without him
 isse aap yah ehsaas dilaane main kaamyaab ho jaaenge ki bas or bas aap hi uske iklaute or sachcha pyaar he
 Through this message you will also make him feel that you are waiting impatiently to see him like this
 is tarah ke bhent or sandesh se aapkaa velentaines de yaadgaar ban jayega
 4
 aksar yah mana jaataa he ki premi ko gift dene main premika ko kaaphi dikkatein aati hai, ve bahut kanfujd rahati hai, par bhramit hone kii koi jarurat he nahin
 If the girlfriend knows well about her lover, then a lot of things are lying in order to give the gift to the lover
 ham aapako bataate hai ki kin gifts ko dekar aap apane premi ko impress kar sakati hai or velentaines de ko special bana sakati hai
 5
 ladke aamtaur par gym jate hai or apni body ko feet rakhane kii koshish karte hai, isliye premika ke liye acha hoga ki velentaines de ke din vah apane premi ko ek acha-sa trekksoot gift karen
 If possible, gift a pair of jogging shoes with it
 isse aapkaa premi na sirf in gifts ko paakar behad khush hoga, balki jab-jab inhen pehnegaa yaa dekhegaa to premika se milane kii talab se bhi batch nahin paaegaa
 6
 ledar wolet ladakon ko khub bhaataa he
 Every boy wants to have a leather wallet
 ledar wolet kabhi bhi purana fishan nahin hota he
 In such a situation, on Valentine's Day, girlfriend can also gift a leather wallet to her lover
 koshish karen ki ledar wolet ke andar apni or apane premi kii gale lagaate hue photo chipka den
 This will help bring more warmth in the relationship of both of you, as well as make Valentine's Day memorable
 7
 Most boys like sports
 saath hi sports se sambandhit chizon ke saath unka lagaav bhi zyada hota he, isliye koshish karen ki apane premi ko velentine de ke din sports kaa koi item gift kare den
 For example, give him a membership gift of a sports club
 pyaar ko or zyada mjedaar banane ke liye gift ke saath ek sandesh laga den or likh den- ‘haev fan, enjoy yor game’
 'happy Valentine's Day'
 jaanate hai, yah padhakar aapkaa premi saatven aasmaan par hoga or yah velentaines de uske jivan kaa sabase yaadgaar dinon main se ek din ban jayega
 8
 mohatarama, ek baat aapako bataa duun ki mahilaayein hi nahin, purushon ko bhi fashneble kapade pahananaa acha lagata he, isliye velentine ke din apane premi ko koi aise kapade gift kar den, jise vah atyadhik pasand karata ho
 This will put his personality on four moons and you will also be saved from thinking
 haa iske liye jaruri he ki aap apane premi kii ichchhaaon se bhaleebhanti parichit hon
 9
 ladakon ko saundarya prashaadhan kii chijen bahut bhaati hai
 He wants his girlfriend to gift him a lot of cosmetics on Valentine's Day
 isamen shaving kit se lekar parafum tak shaamil ho sakate hai
 10
 ladakon ko essessories bhi bahut bhaati hai
 On Valentine's Day, you can gift Brasslet, Chain, Ring to them
 yah unke paas lambey samay tak rahegaa
 Yes keep in mind what your lover likes and what not
 tabhi chizon ko khariden or gift karen
 11
 agar aapkaa premi padhane kaa shaukeen he to unhen acchhee kitabon kaa ek sangrah bhent kar den
 Be sure to include his interest books in this collection of gifts
 agar aap apane gift ko or sundar bananaa chaahati hai, to ek hi lekhak kii kitabon ko shaamil kar unhen sarprise den
 What better gift can there be on Valentine's Day? 12
 aap gift karen unke liye apane pyaar or bhaawanaaon ko vyakt karata hua khud kaa banaaya hua velentine diwas card, jisamen aapaki likhi kavitaayen ho
 13
 apni pasandida smriti chihn, prem-patr evam tasveeron se bharaa hua ek khubasurat scrapbuk banaaen
 This scrapbook will surely be liked by your Valentine
 14
 Make a CD of yourself and their favorite songs, which both of you can enjoy listening together
 kuch romantic sidi, dividi yaa clasik video khariden or use laal riban main ek-saath lapet kar gift karen
 15
 aabhushan hameshaa hi ladakiyon ke liye pasandida uphaar rahaa he
 Buy a heart shaped locket
 usamen apni tasviir daalen or unke naam kaa pehla akshar daalkar us locket ko band karen
 Gift it in a heart-shaped box or tied with fresh flowers
 ladakon ke liye naam kaa pehla akshar ukera hua bracelate gift karen
 16
 aap khud banaaen resham yaa kaanch ke phulon ke guladaste, jo unke paas rahenge hameshaa
 If your girlfriend loves the environment, then gift her a plant, which she can enjoy in her garden every year
 17
 Prepare a favorite meal for your lover or girlfriend
 talika par romantic vyanjanon ko pyaar se sajaaen or mombattiyon kii roshni ke sammohak vaataavaran main ek saath khaaen
 Give the fruit a touch of melting chocolate and cream
 18
 Give them personalized gifts according to their favorite hobbies, such as expressing their feelings by writing on tennis or golf balls or on cigars
 19
 Your most precious gift is with them
 ek saath theatre main koi acchhee film dekhne jaaen yaa kisi spa main jaaen
 Take long walks in the car or plan a romantic weekend by taking a little time out of your busy lifestyle
 20
 If you want to propose on Valentine's Day, sprinkle rose petals around and hide the ring in a candy box or glass of champagne to create a mood
 21
 Organize a Valentine's Day party and play a chocolate-filled game
 aap is din khaas tarah ke mithe chocolate vaale body paint se ek-duusare ke sharir par kalakaari bhi kar sakate hai
