 As the debate on petrol prices skyrocketing, the opinion of people also seems divided as to who is responsible for this? Former Finance Minister p Chidambaram claims that the Central Government could have reduced the price of petrol by Rs 25 per liter if it wanted to give benefits of lower prices of crude oil to the common man
 bijepi samarthakon ne is par palatwaar main kaha ki asal main ye upie sarkaar thi, jisane apane das saal ke shashan mempetrol kii keemtonse logon kii jeb main aag lagaai
 The picture is being spread on social media, showing the comparison of the increase in petrol prices during the UPA and BJP governments
 bijepi samarthak tasviir ke jariye kahana chaahate hai ki upie ke vakt petrol ke daam kahin zyada teji se bade the
 This message says- 'inconvenient facts' - Between 2014-18, the price of petrol increased by 90 paise every year
 jabaki upie ke 10 saal ke kaarykaal main petrol har saal ausatan 4 rupye bade
 Along with others, BJP IT Cell chief Amit Malviya also tweeted the message with graphics
 Inconvenient facts

 com / gwq9c3tacs — Amit Malviya (@amitmalviya) May 22, 2018 At first glance, the data seems easy and effective
 lekin jab iskaa gaharaai se vishleshan kiya gaya to saamne aayaa ki daawa naa sirf bhraamak he balki aadha hi sach he
 Petrol prices vary in different states, but no city has been cited in the bjp's message giving petrol prices
 tulana ke liye hamane dilli main pichley 14 saal mempetrol kii keemtonke utaar-chadhaav kaa vishleshan kiya
 The data on crude oil prices and retail prices of petrol were taken from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell attached to the Petroleum Ministry
 may 2004 main upie 1 jab satta main aayaa or manmohan singh pradhanmantri bane to dilli main petrol kii keemat 33
 71 per liter
 vahiin narendra modi ne may 2014 main jab satta sanbhali to petrol dilli main 71
 41 per liter was being sold
 yani petrol kii keemat das saal ke antaraal main tab 38 rupee bad chuki thi
 This means on an average, the price of petrol is 3 every year during the tenure of UPA
 80 rupye prati litre badi
 Even Amit Malaviya's claim seems correct
 lekin petrol kii retail keemton ko alag karke dekhnaa apane aap main hi visangati hepetrol or dijalki keemten tay karne main do chizein ahm hoti hai- crude oil (kachche tel) kii keemten or centre or rajya sarkaron ke tex
 If taxes are not changed, then the prices of petrol and diesel will be directly up and down, just like the fluctuations in crude oil prices
 tex jahaan centre or rajya sarkaron kii ore se tay kiye jate hai vahiin crude oil kii keemten antarrashtriya bazaar or karansi ke exange rate par nirbhar karti hai jin par sarkaar kaa khaas niyantran nahin hota
 In such a situation, an accurate assessment of petrol retail prices can be done only when the crude oil prices of that time are also taken into consideration
 iske liye hamane beete 14 saal main crude oil kii kya kya keemten raheen, unka bhi adhyayan kiya
 This includes both the upa's tenure and the Modi government's four-year term
 crude oil kii keemten puure vitt varsh main har din kii keemton ke ausat ke aadhaar par nikaali gayi
 Also, the exchange rate of the Indian rupee against the US dollar was also taken into consideration
 isi tarah dilli main petrol kii retail keemton kaa puure saal ke liye bhi ausat nikaala gaya
 a comparison of graphs based on these two inputs gives an accurate picture of how the UPA and Modi government handled petrol prices
 agar do graph ko dekha jaae to pehle safed graph main crude oil kii keemten dikhaai gayi he or duusare bhure graph main petrol kii retail keemten dikhaai gai hai
 If the taxes were the same then you would see two lines of the graph in the same pattern
 
 
 
 Crude oil prices were the lowest in the last 14 years in 2004 when the UPA came to power, but it also rose to a high of $ 112 per barrel during UPA 2
 (yahaan puure saal kii ausat keemat kii baat kii ja rahi he
 Even when the price of crude went up to a high of $ 112 a barrel, the retail price of petrol was 65
 76 rupee prati litre hi rahi
 Petrol price is now touching a high of Rs 77 when crude oil prices are hovering around $ 86 a barrel
 ye ab bhi crude kii ausatan sabase zyada keemat 112 dollar se 25 fisadi kam he
 The highest price of crude was faced by the Manmohan Singh government in 2011-12
 graph se saaf he ki crude oil kii keemten (safed line) modi sarkaar kaa kaarykaal shuru hone ke baad neeche girnaa shuru ho gai thi
 In 2015-16, it came down to $ 46 per barrel
 lekin modi sarkaar ne petrol kii retail keemton ko samaan str par banaae rakhane kaa faisla kiya
 For this, the central excise duty on petrol was continuously increased
 9
 It increased to 21 in January 2016 from Rs 48 per liter
 48 rupee prati litre ke sarvocch str tak pahunch gaya
 When crude oil prices started rising again, the excise duty was reduced by two rupees per liter on 4 October 2017
 tab se ye 19
 Remains at the level of Rs 48 per liter
 upie 2 kaarykaal khatm hone ke baad beete chaar saal kii baat kii jaae to petrol main utpaada shulk 126% or dijal par 330% badha he
 However, the state governments also did not lag behind the central government in terms of earning tax on petrol
 dilli kii baat kare to haalat ye he ki march 2010 main jo waite 12
 It was 5 percent, now it has increased to 27 percent
 dilli to un rajyon main shumaar he, jo sirf petrol par hi waite nahin vasuulate balki dealer ko milane vaale kamishan par bhi alag se waite lagaakar kamai karte hai
 In such a situation, whoever tells you that in the last four years, petrol prices have increased at the rate of 90 paise per year, then it tells you half-way
 asuvidhajanak tathy ye he ki agar modi sarkaar ne satta main aane ke baad kendriya utpaada shulk ko zyada naa badla hota to crude oil kii maujuuda keemton ke hisaab se dilli main ab bhi petrol ke liye logon ko jeb se 65 rupye prati litre hi deele karne padate

 loksabhaa chunaav kii tarikhon ke elaan se pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bade hi tamzam ke saath gorakhpur main ravivaar ko kisaan sammaan nidhi yojana kii shuruyaat kii jisamen desh ke 13 karod kisaanon ko salanaa milane vaali 6 hajaar rupee kii raashi kii pehali kisht ke 2 hajaar rupee jari kar die
 In Uttar Pradesh alone, this amount will come in the account of about twenty five million farmers, out of which the first installment of 2 thousand has reached the account of many and the rest are waiting for money in their account
 centre sarkaar kii is sammaan nidhi yojana par uttar pradesh main kisaanon kii kya raay he or pradhanmantri ke is diarect tu transfar mudde ko kisaan kis tarah se dekhte he, is bare main uttar pradesh kii rajdhani lakhanu ke alaava iske sate shahar barabanki main kisaanon ke mood or mizaaj ko samajhane kii koshish kii gai
 Angry of the farmers for not reaching the money in Barabanki, the team of the farmers reached Shuklai village of Barabanki to know the opinion of the farmers
 is gaanv ke darjanon kisaan pradhanmantri modi ke ₹2,000 pehali kisht hasil kar chuke hai, haalanki abhi bhi aise kai log bhi hai jin tak abhi yah rakam nahin pahunchi he
 When Aajtak talked to these farmers in the fields of this village, most of the farmers appeared satisfied that Prime Minister Modi has taken an initiative but many were also sad that neither money has reached them nor Many forms have been filled
 shuklai gaanv ke paas ke gaanv ke kuch kisaanon ko sarkaar kii ore se kisaan sammaan nidhi yojana ke certificate bhi de die gaye hai jisamen yah bataaya gaya he ki unhen ₹6,000 is yojana ke tahat di ja rahi he
 Many farmers also showed us the SMS on their mobiles
 zyaadaatar log is baat ke intjaar main he ki unke khate main paise aaenge
 However, many are angry that this scheme is just like vote for cash, and the amount is so low that it will not benefit farmers
 kai bujurg kisaanon ne kaha ki yah yojana karj maafee kii yojana se kahin behatar he or vah iskaa istemaal beej kharidne, patwan karne yaa phir khaad kharidne main kar sakate hai, lekin kai kisaan is baat se naaraaz the ki itani kam rakam kisi kaam kii nahin hone vaali kyonki khaad or beej itane mahange ho chuke hai ki vah itani rakam se koi bharpai nahin kar paaenge
 During this time, many farmers showed the form, after filling the form, their name will appear in the list of this beneficiary
 is form main kisaan kaa naam, jati, aadhaar number, mobile number or uske jameen ke record ko likhnaa he
 Farmers who have less than 2 hectares or 20 bighas of land will get the benefit
 philhal logon ke khate main paise pahunchane shuru ho gaye hai or ab zyaadaatar kisaan is ummid main he ki unke form jald se jald bhare jaaen or unke acount main bhi paise aaen
 Prime Minister Modi had said in his speech in Gorakhpur that ₹ 2,000 of the first installment is to be given to 13 crore people and with the beginning, the first installment will reach the account of all farmers within the next three to four weeks
 lakhanu ke kisaan yojana se khush nahibarabanki main kisaan to santusht najar aae lekin rajdhani lakhanu main kuch kisaan khaskar kisaanon kii raajnneeti se jude log is mudde par sarkaar ko gherne main jute hai
 Aajtak talked to about a dozen farmers in the village of Naubasta in Lucknow, there are many big farmers and many small and medium tenants
 lakhanu ke kisaan sarkaar kii is yojana se khush nahin dikhe unke mutabik pahal acchhee ho sakati he, lekin sarkaar kisaan virdohi nitiyon ko aage badha rahi he, in kisaanon ke mutabik sarkaar agar kisaanon ke kharid kii vyavastha kar de jo unhone kisaanon ke liye dedh guna samarthan mulya kaa vaada kiya tha
 If the prices of fertilizer and urea are reduced, there will be no need for this assistance of ₹ 6,000 and if the government wants to give assistance, then at least 20 to 25,000 should be given so that the farmers can get some good
 baharhaal, pradhanmantri modi kii is yojana ko lekar kisaanon ke bich mili-juli pratikriya he
 Most of the farmers are waiting for money in their account, but politically, farmers belonging to many parties are also opposing it
 unke mutabik sarkaar kaa yah vot for cash kaa maamla he or chunaav baad sarkaar ise band bhi kar degi

 Former BSP leader Swami Prasad Maurya joined the Bharatiya Janata Party on Monday in the presence of Amit Shah
 22 june ko mayawati par tikat bechney kaa aarope lagate hue maury ne bispi se istipha de diya tha
 After resigning, Mayawati responded to Maurya's allegations and expelled her from the party

 om maathur achche se jaanate hai ki upi bijepi ke adhyaksh keshav prasad maury bilkul nahin chaahate the ki swami prasad maury bijepi main shaamil hon
 If Swamy's influence on the Kurmi vote is believed, the UP BJP president has expressed his displeasure over Swami to the central leadership
 keshav maury kii naaraazgi ke baad bhi party purv bispi netaa ke upar daanv isliye laga rahi he, kyonki party netritv ko lagata he kii keshav maury kii tulana main swami prasad maury apnikurmi jati ke bade netaahain or unka kurmi voter par zyada prabhaav he
 Om Mathur is well aware that UP has about 6 percent vote bank of Kurmi caste, which has a good influence in more than 100 seats in eastern Uttar Pradesh
 swami ke paas nahin bachaa tha koi rastabiespi chhodane ke baad swami prasad maury ne sabase pehle apni party banane par vichaar kiya tha, or bijepi ke saath gathbandhan kar apana dal kii tarah upividhansabha chunaavamein jane kaa plan banaaya tha
 But this plan of Swami was not approved by Amit Shah and Om Mathur
 maury ne congress or samaajawaadee se bhi sampark kiya tha, lekin baat nahin bani
 He then made up his mind to go to UP elections with RLSP President Upendra Kushwaha, but Upendra Kushwaha pulled back his hand under pressure from BJP
 iske baad swami prasad maury ke paas bijepi main shaamil hona hi ekmaatr vikalp bachaa tha
 BJP has caught a big catch after lakhs of attempts
 lekin bijepi netritv ko ek baat jarur dhyaan main rakhni chahie ki bihar chunaav se pehle isi tarah kaa ek match jitau kaich bijepi ne pakadaa tha, jithan ram maanjhi ke rup main

 dilli main nirbhaya cond ko 4 saal biit gaye hai, lekin wo aaj bhi ham sabake dilon main jinda he
 The Nirbhaya gang-rape case created panic everywhere, from the road to the Parliament and from the country to the world
 iske chaar saal puure hone par 'ajtak' ne nirbhaya ke mata-pita se khaas baatcheet kii
 Here is a special piece of conversation with him
 
 
 sawaal- chaar saal pehle jab andolan hua, to puure desh se hajaaron log aapke saath khadey the, lekin aaj nirbhaya chetana diwas par 200 log bhi nahin hai?-dar or afsos donon he ki ab log saath nahin he
 Which was 4 years ago, because they know that who ate poles 4 years ago
 uskaa koi nateeja nahin niklaa, lekin hamenyayato abhi tak nahin mil paaya
 Question- But why has nothing changed in the society even today? - 5 years Messarkar changes, but in 4 years Nirbhaya has not got justice yet
 samaaj ko nahin philhal nyaay vyavastha ko badalane or sudharne kii zarurat he
 Shame and fear have been eradicated from society
 isiilie badlaav bhi nahin aa paa rahaa he
 Question- No accused has been hanged till now, while this is a case covered in quite a large media? - Every time the whole case is told in the court like Ramayana and Mahabharata, but the truth is that even today the accused None of them have been hanged
 isi se baaki aparaadhiyon ke bhi hausale badhate he ki ek do saal jail main rah lenge, koi na koi bachaa legaa or phir baahar aakar vahi aparaadh karenge
 Question- After 4 years, how are you remembering Nirbhaya today? - Nirbhaya, we have not worn flower garland on the photo even today, because it is alive in society and our heart and will always be
 is baat kii naaraazgi he ki samaaj ko bhi hamaari yaad 16 disambar ko hi yaad aati he
 This also needs to change
 sawaal- nirbhaya ke baad bhi na samaaj ke nazariye main kuch badlaav aayaa he na rape ke maamalon main?-jab bhi is tarah kii ghatnaayen hoti he, to sirf-baachiyon par hi sawaal khadey kiye jate he
 We are still fighting, but did the government fulfill its responsibility? Did the justice system do its job responsibly? Until this happens nothing will change, but we will still fight

 BJP MP from Ladakh, Jamyang Sering Namgyal, who was discussed with his fiery speech on Article 370 in Parliament, believes that the region was not given due consideration in defense policies under the Congress rule and that is why 'china occupied its territory till Demchok sector have done it

 For Asaram's biggest royal, the biggest weapon to surrender the girls to Asaram, Shilpi finally came on her own after a month-long hideout and surrendered before the court
 ab jaahir he shilpi ke samarpan ke saath hi asaram ke saamne samparn karne vaali tamaam ladakiyon kaa sach ek-ek kar baahar aana shuru ho jayega
 That is, it is certain that the coming days are more troublesome for Asaram
 asaram ko jail hui or shilpi usase pehle hi faraar hui
 In search of Shilpi, the police gathered with great vigor, but the police could not find it even when Shilpi hid in the bill, but now after a month, Shilpi himself appeared and surrendered in the District Court of Jodhpur
 hoicourt se agrim zamaanat khaarij hone ke 10 minute ke bheetar hi shilpi ne court main sarender kar diyandopaher saadhe teen baje shilpi kii hoicourt se jamaanat yachika khaarij hui thi or 3 bajkar 40 minute par shilpi ne apane aapako police ke hawaale kar diya
 On September 18, Shilpi filed a bail petition in the High Court, whereas before that, the bail petition of Shilpi was dismissed from the sessions court
 asaram par jis din se yon shaushan ke aarope lage hai, har roj koi naa koi bada khulaasa ho rahaa he
 Asaram, who is wearing white clothes of faith, is making the mud of stigma darker everyday
 ab police ke giraft main har wo shaks aa chukaa he jo baba ke choubison ghante ird gird rahata tha
 First the serviceman Siva, then cook Prakash and Chhindwara Ashram director Sharat Chandra and now Asaram's close craftsman are also under police custody
 jaahir he ab asaram ke cese kii kadiyaan phir se judengi
 People living like shadows around Asaram will come face to face
 phir raaj bhi bade khulenge
 That is, a new countdown of Asaram's troubles has started now
 asaram 1 oktober tak nyaayik hiraasat main hai
 The police is busy preparing the charge sheet
 ab asaram bachenge yaa phir jail main jaaenge, sabaki najar isi par he
 If the accusation of the victim girl is true and believe the Jodhpur police investigation is true, it is the girl who prepared the girls studying in Asaram's Gurukul to surrender to Asaram
 bakaul jodhpur police asaram ne shilpi ko apane gurukal kaa warden hi isi makasad se banaaya tha
 Shilpi tells a lot about absconding, then filing bail in the lower court and then knocking on the high court door if the application is rejected
 akhir kya vajah he ki shilpi ab tak us maamle main police or kaanoon kaa saamana karne se batch rahi thi, jis maamle main ulajh kar khud uske guru asaram bade ghar pahunch gaye
 According to the police, Shilpi is the girl who not only prepared the entire land to present this girl in front of Asaram, but also made more girls to surrender to Asaram and Asaram gave Shilpi only this intention
 From Haridwar's ashram, he was sent as a warden to his Gurukul in Chhindwara
 shilpi gai, usne ladki se baat bhi kii lekin jab ladki asaram ke saamne jane ko taiyaar nahin hui to usne ladki ko asaram ke saamne pesh karne ke liye nai kahani taiyaar kar lee
 According to the police, this story was about ghosts and illness
 darasal, ye shilpi hi thi jisane ladki par bhoot pret kaa saaya hone kii baat kah kar use asaram se akele milwane kaa plan taiyaar kiya or ladki peeche hatane lagi to ladki ke maa-baap ko hi jhaanse main le liya
 Since the girl's parents were already devotees of Asaram, they could not refuse the offer and this single change changed the life of the entire family
 lekin police kii maane to shilpi kii ye pehali or iklauti karatuut nahin he, balki shilpi ne is ladki ke alaava bhi kai ladakiyon ko isi tarah baba ke paas pesh karne ke liye taana-bana buna he
 Not only this, she can also remove the veil from Asaram's so-called disease, intoxicating habit and other right and wrong occupations, and now lately, the artisan has reached the police and the law
 aise main dekhnaa ye he akhir police shilpi se uske guru ke kitne or kaise kaale raaj ugalva paati he
 Sanchita Gupta alias Shilpi was a minor girl till a few years ago but seeing what she came in contact with Asaram, she completed the journey from floor to hail but now the wheel of Tadir has turned once again and now Shilpi with Baba The stars are also in the clouds
 vaise to shilpi asaram ke chhidwara ashram ke skool ke girls hoster kii warden thi lekin kaha jaataa he ki asaram ke sansaarik anand kii wo sutaradhar thi
 a friend who was a partner in Baba Asaram's stories of frustrations, who had disappeared since Asaram's arrest
 sanchita gupta urf shilpi, jo asaram ke liye na sirf ladakiyon ko fansaati thi balki unhen is baat ke liye bhi bahalaati-phuslaati thi ki wo asaram ke saamne khud ko samarpit kar den
 The minor girl who accused Asaram of sexual abuse was also the first to be seduced and seduced by Shilpi
 shilpi ne hi asaram par yon utpeedan ke aarope lagane vaali bacchee ke dimag main beemaari kaa nasoor bharaa tha
 Asaram's friend, friend and partner, the same, had tucked it into the girl's mind and explained that your mental condition is not well and the cure for this disease is only with Asaram
 jaise hi is puure maamle kaa khulaasa hua or asaram jail gaye vaise hi unki dost, unke kai gunahon kaa sach jaanane vaali raajadaar shilpi achaanak adrishy ho gai thi jabaki jodhpur police ne asaram se pehle shilpi ke liye warrant nikaala tha
 She was granted muster permission till August 29, but the police rejoiced in the attention of Asaram that Shilpi had become like a pigeon and now that she is in the hands of the police, obviously many more shocking secrets will open
 pehle nijee sevadaar shiva, phir chhindwara ashram kaa diarector sharat chand, uske baad rasoiyaa prakaash or ab sabase ahm mohara shilpi
 These are not just names, but in reality they are the trouble of Asaram because these are the princes who will rise as Raja's prison journey will grow longer
 asaram or unke bete narayan sai ne kaha tha ki peedit ladki maansik rup se biimaar thi lekin police ko diye bayaan main unke chhindwara gurukul ke diarector sharat chandra ne kaha he kipidita ko koi beemaari nahin thi
 The girl was in contact with the warden of the ashram, Shilpi, and she knows what the disease was
 asaram ke ahmedabad ashram se nirdesh milane ke baad hi unhone shilpi urf sanchita gupta ko naukari par rakhaa tha
 The Jodhpur police rushed to Chhindwara Gurukul with Sharatchand to corroborate Sharatchand's statements and gather evidence related to it
 duusari taraf asaram ke rasoiyaa prakaash ne bhi poochtacha main khulaasa kiya kiasaram kaa mobile phone main hi rakhata tha
 Shilpi, Sharat Chandra and Shiva received a call to bring the victim to Jodhpur Madai Kutia
 khud asaram ko pehle se pataa tha ki peedita madi kutiyaa main aane vaali he or iske liye intjaam ke aadesh bhi de die gaye the
 When Asaram used to touch a girl or a woman, there was no opposition but all the girls came for dedication
 sansad main mangalvaar ko khaadya suraksha bill par hangaame ke asaar hai
 The UPA government has called an all-party meeting to agree on several issues, including the food bill
 ek taraf bijepi is bill ke samarthan kaa elaan kar chuki he duusari taraf gujarat ke siem narendra modi ne food bill ke maujuuda praaroop main kuch binduon par aitraaj jaahir kiya he
 Modi wants a meeting of all Chief Ministers to be convened on this issue
 iske liye unhone pradhanmantri ko chitthee bhi likhi he
 Modi has written in a letter to Manmohan Singh that this is an issue that both central and state governments have to deal with
 modi ne patr main aarope lagaaya he ki garib pariwaron ko adhyadesh ke jariye ‘khaadya arakshit’ bana diya gaya he jo ‘khaadya suraksha ke mul uddeshyon kii purti nahin karata
 'he has alleged in the letter dated August 7 that the ordinance under the ordinance' impracticable statutory responsibilities have been given to the central and state governments 'and' the number of beneficiaries has been fixed without fixing eligibility criteria and individual rights
 vibhinn rajyon ke bich vyapak kshetreey asamanthaayen ho sakati hai
 According to Modi, the Parliamentary Standing Committee had recommended in January 2013 that the government should decide the eligibility criteria after consulting the state government
 ’ unhone kaha ki adhyadesh main garibi rekha se neeche rahane vaale pariwaron kaa haq 35 kilogram prati parivaar se ghataakar ausat paanch vyakti ke parivaar ko 25 kilogram karne kaa prastaav he
 He said, 'this cannot be the objective of the Food Security Bill which reduces the rights of those who have been identified as living below the poverty line
 ’unhone kaha ki duusari ore yojana ayog yah daawa kar rahaa he bipiel pariwaron kii sankhya main kami hui he lekin adhyadesh ke tahat jansankhya ke do tihaai logon ko khaadya sahaayta dene kii baat he

 The BJP on Monday demanded that the provision of mercy petition for convicts sentenced to death in cases of killing a victim after rape should be abolished
 loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne peedit 23 varshiya ladki kaa ‘gopneey’ dhang se antim sanskaar kiye jane kii aalochana kii
 He said that cases of rape should be completed within six months and the death penalty should be given to the culprits who killed the victim after rape
 unhone kaha ki sansad ke aagaamee sansad satr main aise praavdhaan karne ke liye kanoon main sanshodhan kiya janaa chahie
 Sushma strongly criticized the UPA government for accepting the mercy plea of the death row convicts of five cases of murder after rape and freeing them from death sentence
 unhone kaha, ‘aise maamalon ke doshiyon ko faansee ke fande par latakaana chahie or aisa karne waalon kii dayaa yachikaaon ko sarkaar ko sweekaar nahin karnaa chahie
 The Leader of the Opposition said that he had spoken to the Prime Minister about this and demanded a special session of Parliament to review the current laws
 lekin use asweekaar kar diya gaya
 She complained that her demand to call an all-party meeting to discuss the issue of women's safety was also not accepted
 sarkaar par unhone keval ‘‘drama’’ karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki peedit ladki kaa jis gopneeyata se antim sanskaar kiya gaya use vah galat maanati hai
 He said, "the government continues to mislead us about the last rites
 ’rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne kaha ki kisi ladki ke saath samuhik balaatkaar ko mahaz ‘‘vibhats, barbar, amanviya’’ kahana kaaphi nahin he
 This signifies that 'we have failed the test of civilization

 Doing so will give respect to the victim

 The Shiv Sena took another major step on the same day, supporting Congress President Rahul Gandhi's statement as Prime Ministerial candidate
 maharashtra ke sangli main hone vaale vidhansabha upachunaav ke liye shivasena ne congress ummidavaar ko apana samarthan karne kaa elaan kiya he
 Significantly, this seat is being held after the death of senior Congress leader Patangrao Kadam
 sangli jile ke palus-kadeganv seat par congress ne yahaan vishwajit kadam ko apana ummidavaar banaaya he, jiske liye shivasena ne samarthan kaa elaan kiya he
 There will be voting on May 28
 shivasena ne ek press release jari karte hue kaha ki bijepi ne yahaan nirvirodh chunaav nahin hone diya or kadam ke saamne ummidavaar ko khadaa kiya
 Shiv Senane said in his statement that former leader Patangrao has done a lot of work for education and society in this seat
 isliye yahaan par nirvirodh nae pratyaashee ko chunaa janaa chahie tha, yahi kaaran he ki ham vishwajit ko apana samarthan de rahe hai
 At the same time, BJP has also reversed this decision of Shiv Sena
 bijepi pravaktaa ram kadam kaa kahana he ki shivasena kaa is seat par koi auchity nahin he, isliye unka samarthan koi myne nahin rakhata he
 If that was the case, he would have done the same in Palghar
 unhone kaha ki hamaare dil main patangrao kadam ji ke liye sammaan he, lekin raajnneeti main chunaav jarur hona chahie
 On the other hand, Vishwajit Kadam also thanked the Shiv Sena for its support
 unhone kaha ki patangrao or balasaheb ji ke bich kaaphi achche sambandh the
 So thank you for supporting Shiv Sena

 Not only this, so far, Priyanka Gandhi used this word for CM Yogi too, going ahead of the Congress strategy using the slogan 'chowkidar Chor Hai' against PM Narendra Modi and said that the watchman only does the duty of the rich , They do not care for the poor
 yogi ke khilaaf priyanka ke aakraamak mod kaa andaja is baat se bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unhone ab tak kiye gaye apane kul 12 twits main 4 yogi sarkaar ke khilaaf kiye hai
 The hard work of education teachers of Uttar Pradesh is insulted daily, hundreds of victims committed suicide

 com / ebeynst3va— Priyanka Gandhi Vadra (@priyankagandhi)march 25, 201923 janvari 2019 ko congress mahasachiv niyukt hone ke baad priyanka gandhi ne farvari main twitor par dastak di thi
 He then tweeted on the occasion of the attack in New Zealand, the death of Manohar Parrikar and Holi
 ab tak unhone ek bhi twit main piem narendra modi ke khilaaf kuch nahin kaha, lekin ravivaar subah se wo lagaataar yogi adityanath ke khilaaf back-tu back twit kar rahi hai
 After raising the issue of payment of dues to sugarcane farmers on Sunday morning, they raised the issue of Anganwadi workers and helpers during the night
 unhone likhaa ki upi kii anganbari kaaryakarta or sahayikaayen rajya karmchaaree kaa darja maang rahi hai, lekin bhaajapa sarkaar ne unki pidaa sunne ke bajaay un par laathiyaan chalavaain
 My sisters struggle is my struggle
 iske turant baad unhone ashakarmiyon ke saath tasviir share karte hue likhaa ki jo ashakarmi garbhvatee mahilaon ke swasthya kii jimmedaari uthaati hai, unhen 600 rupee milte hai
 But the BJP government never took care of them
 priyanka kii is aakraamakata ke baad siem yogi aditnyath ko bhi maidan main utarana padaa
 He also responded to Priyanka through a tweet
 ashakarmiyon ke saath priyanka gandhiravivaar ko ganna kisaanon ke bhugtan par twit karne ke baad ab yogi adityanath ne ashakarmiyon ke mudde par bhi priyanka gandhi ko sidhaa jawaab diya he
 Yogi has written that the sinking of the Congress, the new story of Naiyya is trying to trick the public with misleading propaganda
 ab tak aashaa bahanon kii shubhachintak kahaan thim
 Sleepy? Yogi said that recently the government has announced an increase of Rs 750 in their honorarium
 isse pehle ganna kisaanon ke bhugtan par yogi ne priyanka gandhi ko jawaab dete hue unhen 'tathakthith' hitaishi bataaya tha
 Holding the old governments of the SP-BSP responsible for the plight of sugarcane farmers, Yogi said that when the farmer was on the verge of starvation from 2012 to 2017, where were these benevolent people, why is his sleep now open? Yogi had told the farmers to be happy, then on Monday morning Priyanka Gandhi first took Yogi Adityanath on the target and surrounded him on this new issue
 shiksha mitron kaa mudda uthaate hue priyanka gandhi ne twit kiya or likhaa ki shikshamitron kii mehnat kaa roj apmaan hota he, saikadon peediton ne aatmahatya kar daali
 The government on the streets fired sticks on them, registering Rasuka
 bhaajapa ke netaa tii-sharton kii marketing main vyast hai
 i wish they had also paid attention to the brave people
 is tarah unhone yogi sarkaar par ek or mudde kii bauchhaar kar di or ravivaar subah se lekar somvaar subah tak 24 ghante ke andar unhone chaar bade mudde uthaate hue yogi sarkaar ko gherne kaa kaam kiya
 From the electoral point of view, this stand of Priyanka is being considered very important, because the eastern UP she has got charge of is considered to be the stronghold of CM Yogi
 aise main sidhe unhen nishaanaa banaakar priyanka soobe kii janata or unke muddon se bhi khud ko jodna chaahati hai

 Camera spelist dxo Labs concludes this

 Experts at dxo Labs resorted to a variety of criteria for this and stated that its camera is actually better than the Sony Xperia Z3 camera
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki yphone 6 kaa camera 8 megapixl kaa he jabaki soni experia kaa 20

 The colors taken in the photos taken from it are completely natural and have full detail

 desh main davaaiyaan is kadar mahangi ho chuki hai ki garib marijon ke liye ise khareednaa behad mushkil ho gaya he
 But now Mumbaikars will not worry about it
 mumbai main ek aisa dawa bank khul gaya he, jahaan jaruratmandon ko muft main dawa di jaati he
 But for this, Mumbaikars will have to donate additional medicine kept in their house
 agar aapke ghar main bhi aisi davaaiyaan rakhi hui hai, jo expyri date kaa itanjar kar rahi hai, to use aap is dawaai bank naam kii daanpeti main daal sakate hai
 This medicine is placed in front of Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, from 11 am to 7 pm
 agar aap vahaan tak nahin ja sakate, to 'jivan jyot' naam ke enjio ko kol karen, vah aapke ghar ek ambulance jaisaa vaahan bhejkar aapke ghar se davaaiyaan le jayega
 In this medicine bank, a three-member team of doctors sort the deposited medicines separately according to the disease
 cancer ke liye alag, kidney stone or dialysis ke liye alag yaa phir koi or beemaari ke liye alag
 Later the complete data of medicines is saved on a computer
 ek janvari 2014 se shuru kii gai medicin bank naam kii is muft seva kii jaankaree ab tak mubaivasiyon ko kam hi he
 According to the NGO, not only the patients of Tata Memorial Hospital, but also patients of Wadia, Nair, KEM and many private hospitals come here
 ab kai marij is seva kaa laabh uthaanaa chaahate hai
 The special thing is that the medical shops around are also supporting this free medicine service
 ye dukandaar maanate hai ki davaaiyaan or ilaaj is kadar mahange ho chuke hai ki marijon ke paas dawaai kharidne tak ke paise nahin hote
 It is worth noting that this NGO not only gives free medicines to the patients, but also serves free lunch and dinner to the patients and their family
 bhartiya cricket sangh yani bisisiai ne ipel−7 ke pehle charan kaa aayojan sanyukt arab emirate main karwaane kii thaanee to ek saath kai sawaal khadey ho gaye
 Especially after the event at Sharjah Cricket Stadium, a round of questions has started regarding IPL-7
 sharajah kaa naam sunate hi cricket fans ke zehan main javed minyaadaad kaa wo aakhri gend par chakka kaundh jaataa he, jisane kai saal cricket team or cricket premiyon kii bechaini ko barqaraar rakhaa or aaj bhi tis ke saath yaad kiya jaataa he
 Indian cricket fans do not forget even those matches when Sanath Jayasuriya played 189 for Sri Lanka in the final of Asia Cup
 ran banaae or jeet ke liye 300 ke lakshya kaa peechha karti hui bhartiya team 27wein over main hi 54 ran banaakar ol out ho gai
 Robin Singh scored the most for India in the match
 bhartiya team ko 245 ranon se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Sharjah played an important role in bringing cricket Bollywood and the market together, but at the same time there was a bad name for cricket in the shadow of the betting underworld and match fixing
 saal 2000 main hue match fixing scandle ne sharajah kii chhavi dhoomil kar di
 After this dispute, the Indian government decided to ban Team India from playing in Sharjah
 bibisi ke cricket samvaadadaata jonathan ague ne yahaan tak kaha ki wo vahaan kam se kam darjanabhar maichon kaa gavaah rahe hai jo fixd the
 He was willing to take oath for this, though the icc's Anti Corruption Unit could not prove anything
 sharajah ko lekar shaq ke badal hameshaa chaaye rahe
 This is the reason why cricketers like Kirti Azad are still not missing out on the bcci's decision
 kirti azaad ne bayaan diya ki mudgal cameti kii jaanch ke baavjood bisisiai ke is faisale se wo hairaan hai ki ipel−7 Some of the matches will be held in the United Arab Emirates
 kirti kehete hai ki yuai to acha vikalp he, ye fixing kaa pavilion he
 i sincerely hope that some BCCI officials will be very happy with this
 bhartiya team ko 2006 main bhi yuai main match khilne kii ijazat mili, phir haal ke dinon main duusare deshon ke alaava under 19 The Indian team was also allowed to play here
 bhartiya team ne asia cap ke final main pakistan ko haraaya jabaki Team India finished at number five in the Under 19 World Cup
 haalanki ipel or bisisiai ke adhikari daawa kar rahe hai ki wo beete saal kii galatiyon ko sharajah main dubaara nahin hone denge, lekin yuai or khaaskar sharajah main match ke aayojan par sawaal zarur uthte rahenge
 Memories of Sharjah are not just bitter for cricket fans
 shaayad javed miyandad ke chakke kii kadavaahat 12 saal baad 1998 main kam hui jab sachin tendulkar ne australia ke kilaaf sharajah main oparation 'desert storm' ko anjaam diya
 Sachin played two consecutive centuries against Australia in that tournament and on his 25th birthday, his fans ko nayab tohafaa diya
 The storm during the match did not allow Sachin to divert his attention
 wo toofaan ke dauraan bhi helmet pahane rahe
 Sachin's two innings made Sachin the finest batsman in the world
 shen worne ne baad main mana ki sachin unke He kept getting scared in his dreams
 oparation desert storm main sachin tendulkar kii ye pari ek mithi yaad banakar bhartiya fans ke zehan main zarur he, lekin Cricket in Sharjah will have to undergo similar storms
 ye baat khilaadiyon or adhikariyon ko yaad rakhni hogi

 darasal immergency ke tees saal puure hone se thik pehle indian express main chape ek intervyuu main adwani ne kaha he - sanvaidhanik or kanoonee suraksha kavchon ke baavjood loktantr ko kuchal sakane vaali taaqatein philhal majboot hai; ye bharosa dilaane vaala koi qadam nahin dikhataa ki phir se naagarik adhikaar kaarij yaa muattal nahin kiye jaaenge; main nahin kahata ki raajnneetik netritv paripakv nahin he, lekin kamazoriyon ke kaaran bharosa nahin hota; bhartiya raajnneeti main mujhe netritv ke kisi vishisht pahalu kaa bharosa dilaane vaale nishaan nahin milte
 ' jaankaar maanate hai ki laal krishna adwani ne ishaaron main bijepi kii maujuuda leadership kii kshamta or uske kaamkaaj ke tareeke par sawaal uthaae hai
 However, he believes that the situation has changed in the last forty years and in the current situation it will not be possible for any political leadership to control the media
 tippaniyan Advani's statement has given the bjp's opponents a chance to attack the government directly
 congress netaa ajay maakan ne pradhanmantri narendra modi kii kaaryastylee par sawaal uthaaai to niteesha kumaar ne kaha ki adwani sabase varisht netaa hai or unke bayaan ko behad gambhirtha se liya janaa chaiye
 While CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said that his party had been questioning the dictatorial attitude of the government before
 in sabake bich arvind kejariwal ne twit kar ye andeshaa jataayaa he ki immergency kaa pehla prayog kahin dilli main to nahin ho jayega? beshak, adwani ne ek badi bahes chhedi he or iske ghere main unki apni sarkaar bhi he jis par sansthaaon ko kamazor karne kaa ilzaam he
 The BJP immediately clarified that this is not a gesture against any leader

 In fact, just before the completion of thirty years of Emergency, Advani said in an interview published in the Indian Express - Despite the constitutional and legal safeguards, the forces which can crush democracy are currently strong; There does not appear to be any assurance that the civil rights will not be dismissed or dismissed again; i do not say that political leadership is not mature, but weaknesses do not lead to trust; In Indian politics, i do not find marks that give credence to any specific aspect of leadership
 ' Experts believe that Lal Krishna Advani has raised questions about the bjp's current leadership capability and its functioning in gestures
 haalanki wo ye maanate hai ki pichley chalis saal main halaat badale hai or maujuuda halaat main kisi bhi political leadership ke liye media ko niyantrit karnaa sambhav nahin hoga
 The comments adwani ke is bayaan se bijepi ke virodhiyon ko sidhe sarkaar par hamalaa bolne kaa mauqaa mil gaya he
 When Congress leader Ajay Maken questioned the working style of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Nitish Kumar said that Advani is the most senior leader and his statement should be taken very seriously
 jabaki sipiem mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki unki party pehle se sarkaar ke taanaashaahee rukh par sawaal uthaati rahi he
 Amidst all this, Arvind Kejriwal has tweeted that it is feared that the first use of Emergency will be done in Delhi
 Of course, Advani has waged a big debate and is also surrounded by his own government, which is accused of weakening the institutions

 centre kii mahatvakankshi pradhanmantri kaushal vikaas yojana ke naam ke durupyog ke jariye indore main kareeb 400 berozegaar yuvakon ke saath thagi kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 The police arrested a 50-year-old thug on Tuesday for allegedly defrauding unemployed youth
 atirikt police adheekshak (eespi) bittu sahagal ne samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya ki maamle main giraftaar janak mehta (50) par aarope he ki usne yahaan ek training centre kholkar berozegaar yuvaaon ko jhansa diya ki uskaa centre pradhanmantri kaushal vikaas yojana se sambaddh he
 He collected Rs 2000-2000 in the name of skill development training for a month from 400 youth
 sahagal ne bataaya ki mehta ne yuvaaon ko jaal main fansaate hue kaha ki prashikshan puraa hone ke baad unhen rashtriya kaushal vikaas nigam (enesdisi) kii ore se pramaan patr diya jayega or unki 2,000 rupee kii fees waapas kar di jaaegi
 But after this training, the youth were neither given any certificate from NSDC, nor were their fees deposited
 unhone bataaya ki thagi ke shikaar kuch yuvakon kii shikaayat par jab police ne jaanch kii, to pataa chalaa ki mehta kaa training centre pradhanmantri kaushal vikaas yojana yaa enesdisi se kisi tarah sambaddh hi nahin he
 After this revelation, Mehta was arrested
 tippaniyan The ASP said that Mehta was originally from Bhavnagar in Gujarat
 vah madhyapradesh ke adivasee bahul jhabua jile main pichley saal berozegaar yuvakon ko kaushal vikaas prashikshan dene ke naam par isi tarah thag chukaa he
 He was also arrested in this case
 baad main vah jamaanat par chhot gaya tha
 (this news has not been edited by the NDTV team
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Bittu Sehgal told reporters that Janak Mehta (50), who was arrested in the case, is accused of opening a training center here and tricked unemployed youth into believing that his center is affiliated to the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana
 usne kareeb 400 yuvaaon se maheene bhar ke kaushal vikaas prashikshan ke naam par 2000-2000 rupee vasule
 Sehgal said that Mehta implicated the youth in the trap and said that after the completion of the training, they would be given a certificate from the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and their fees of Rs 2,000 would be refunded
 lekin is training ke baad yuvaaon ko na to enesdisi kii ore se koi praaanpatr diya gaya, na hi unki jamaa karai fees lautaai gai
 He said that when police investigated on the complaint of some youths who were cheating, it was found that Mehta's training center is not related to the Prime Minister's Skill Development Scheme or NSDC in any way
 is khulaase ke baad mehta ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 The comments eespi ne bataaya ki mehta mulat: gujarat ke bhavnagar kaa rahane vaala he
 He has been cheated in the name of imparting skill development training to unemployed youth in tribal-dominated Jhabua district of Madhya Pradesh last year
 is maamle main use giraftaar bhi kiya gaya tha
 He was later released on bail

 In such a situation, it is very important that all efforts are made to remove the displeasure of your spouse
 haa, itnaa jaruri dhyaan rakhana chahie ki koi bhi nirnay vivek ke saath kiya jaae
 The process of mourning can prove to be sweetness rather than bitterness in life; Here are some tips: -first try to find out what is the reason for your spouse's displeasure
 yah maaloom karne ke baad us vajah ko dur karne kii eemaandaar koshish karen
 -if you have been hurt by any of your behavior, do not delay too much to celebrate with ego
 yaad rakhen ki manaane kii pahal karnaa aapke partner ke dil ko bharpoor sukun pahunchayegaa or aapasi prem main or ijapha hi hoga
 - Delay in the initiative to convince a hidden life partner will reveal your rude and obstinate behavior, which will later become a bit of a bitterness in the relationship
 -agar ruuthane kaa silsilaa har duusare-tisare din shuru ho jaae, to is bare main apane saathi ko khule dimag se samajhaayen
 a big problem can arise from the habit of accepting every demand
 -behatar tarika to yah he ki parivaar main koi ahm nirnay lene se pehle na keval apane jeevansaath ko pehle se jaankaree de den, balki nirnay lene kii prakriya main unhen bhi bhagidaar banaaen
 This creates a sense of accountability, sharpen the ability to make decisions as well
 iskaa ek phayda yah bhi he ki parinaam chaahe jaisaa bhi ho, aatmasantushti jarur milti he
 So what are you waiting for now ho jaaie taiyaar rishte main or bhi zyada mithaas gholne ke liye

 virendra sahvaag, gautam gambhir, eshanth sharma or shikhar dhawan ke baad ab team india ke test captain viraat kohli ne bhi kendriya vitt mantri or didisie ke purv pramukh arun jetali kaa khulaa samarthan kiya he
 Amid the accusations of the Aam Aadmi Party to keep an eye on financial irregularities during his tenure, Arun Jaitleyper said, "during his tenure, he did a lot for the well being of Delhi cricket as well as the players
 ’kohli ne twit kiya, ‘hamaare sangh ke adhyaksh ke rup main jetali ji ke prati ham abhaari he
 He always wanted to work for the betterment of cricket and the well being of cricketers
 ’grateful to have@arunjaitleyji as the president of our associationhe has always wanted to improve the game & help cricketers in everyway— Virat Kohli (@imvkohli)december 20, 2015jetali didisie main bataur adhyaksh 13 varsh ke apane kaarykaal ke dauraan hui kathith vittiya aniyamittaaon ke aaropon kaa saamana kar rahe hai or dilli sarkaar ne haal hi main isaki jaanch ke aadesh die hai
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has demanded Jaitley to resign from the post of Union Finance Minister due to the mess in the DDCA
 sahvaag, gambhir, dhawan, eshanth kaa samarthanisse pehle diggaj ballebaaj virendra sahvaag or unke purv saathi salaami ballebaaj gautam gambhir ne shanivaar ko arun jetali ke prati samarthan vyakt kiya tha
 Sehwag tweeted on Saturday, 'it was very difficult to talk to any other officer in the DDCA, but Jaitley was always with the players whenever there was any kind of trouble
 ’sahvaag ne kaha, ‘jab tak main cricket main sakriy tha agar mujhe kisi khilaadi ke ‘ascharyajanak’ tareeke se chaynit hone kaa pataa chalata tha to mujhe sirf arun jetali ko suchit karnaa hota tha or jetali tatkaal galati sudhaarte or yogya khilaadi ke saath nyaay karte the
 'it is noteworthy that former veteran spin bowler Bishan Singh Bedi has also supported the allegations of the Delhi government, but Gambhir says that Jaitley has done a lot for the development of cricket during his tenure
 gambhir ne bhi twit kiya, ‘kuch purv khilaadiyon dwaara didisie main hui har tarah kii gadabadi ke liye arun jetali par aarope lagaana hairaan karne vaala he
 'gambhir further tweeted,' It is completely wrong to blame Jaitley for the corruption in DDCA
 unheen kii vajah se karadaataaon kaa rupee liye bagaiyr dilli ko ek antarrashtriya stadium mila
 'grossly inappropriate 2 blame @ arunjaitleyji 4 corruption in DDCA
 He was d one who got Delhi a proper stadium widout taxpayer's money
 - GGF (@gautamgambhir) December 20, 2015 Fast bowler Ishant Sharma, who played for Delhi in domestic cricket, also tweeted and expressed his support for Jaitley
 eshanth ne likhaa, ‘arun jetali se main jab bhi mila or baatcheet kii, vah mujhe hameshaa madadgaar, nishpaksh or dayaalu najar aae
 '
 @arunjaitleyji has always been helpful, fair and kind in all my interactions with him # DDCA— Ishant Sharma (@imishant)december 20, 2015team ke dhakad salaami ballebaaj shikhar dhawan ne bhi arun jetali ke samarthan main twit kiya
 He wrote, 'arun Jaitley always wanted to give high facilities to the cricketers of Delhi and a cricketer like me has got the benefit of his leadership
 ’@arunjaitleyji always ensured top facilities for Delhi cricketers and players like me, from humble background always benefited under him
 - Shikhar Dhawan (@ sdhawan25) December 20, 2015 'ddca's situation worsens after Jettley' Gautam Gambhir has said in favor of Arun Jaitley that during his tenure there were many good works in Delhi cricket but after he left his post The situation only got worse in the last two years
 gambhir ne yahaan patrakaron se kaha, ‘jab jetali didisie ke adhyaksh the tab isamen kaaphi achche kaam hue
 An international level stadium was constructed
 aapane dekha hoga ki pehle kotla kis tarah kaa stadium tha or ab kaisaa he
 All these things happened only when Jaitley was the chairman
 ’dilli ranjai team ke captain ne kaha, ‘aaj jo bhi log unki aalochana kar rahe hai, ve bhi cricket sudhaar samiti kaa hissaa the
 He was given the top post and did nothing for Delhi
 unhone kaha, ‘ab jabaki vah (jetali) adhyaksh nahin hai tab un par har tarah ke aarope lagaae ja rahe hai
 If this is the case then they should not hold such positions in DDCA
 aaj saare aarope didisie par nahin balki jetali par lagaae ja rahe hai
 My question is that he was not running the DDCA alone
 vitt mantri jetali 2013 tak 13 varshon tak didisie ke pramukh rahe
 The Delhi government has accused him of turning a blind eye to alleged corruption in the DDCA during his tenure
 aap sarkaar ne swatantra jaanch ke liye jetali se istipha dene yaa unhen pad se hataane kii maang kii he
 'gambhir further said in the matter,' i believe the situation worsened after he left his post
 yadi aap is saal pratham shrenee satr se purv kii taiyaariyon par gaur karo to vahaan koi gendbaaj nahin tha, koi wicket yaa nets nahin the
 This never happened when Jaitleyji was the president
 ’unhone kaha, ‘main nahin jaanata ki kisi tarah kaa bhrashtachar hua yaa nahin, meraa sirf itnaa maananaa he ki vartmaan adhikari vahaan nahin hone chahie kyonki unhone kabhi cricket ke bare main nahin sochaa
 Earlier the situation was very good
 pichley do varshon jaisi buree sthiti didisie pehle kabhi nahin rahi
 There is no one who can go and talk about it
 ’‘baagi tevar jetali ke khilaaf nahin tha’gambhir, virendra sahvaag or kuch anya senior khiladiyon ne dilli evam jila cricket sangh kii khel samiti se naakhush hokar 2009 main prashasan ke khilaaf baagi tevar apana die the
 Regarding that revolt, Gambhir said, 'our opposition was not for Jaitley ji, it was for other officers of DDCA
 hamane kabhi unka naam nahin liya
 We always said that whenever we had any kind of trouble, we went to Jaitley ji for everything when it should not have happened
 yadi aapako har kaam ke liye jetali ji ke paas hi janaa tha to phir anya adhikariyon or prashaskon kaa kya kaam tha
 Then what does it mean to be a union? isliye tab hamen anya adhikariyon se pareshaani thi or yahaan tak ki ab bhi hamen anya adhikariyon se pareshaani he
 Me and Sehwag have always had very good relations with Jaitley ji
 ’gambhir se poocha gaya ki kya vah kabhi dilli kii team chodenge to unhone kaha, ‘main hameshaa dilli kaa ladkaa rahaa
 i never thought of leaving Delhi
 meraa dil dilli ke liye dhadkta he
 i started my career with Delhi and i want to end my career by staying with Delhi because i feel that this is my home team and it gave me a chance to play for India
 vahaan jo bhi avyavashtha thi yaa he, isane mujhe mauka diya
 "the proposed bilateral series between India and Pakistan is uncertain and Gambhir said that the governments of both countries have to decide on this
" unhone kaha, ‘yah raajnneetik faisla he
 Governments are always decided about the series between India and Pakistan and they are the ones who approve it
 yadi aap kisi khilaadi se poochhoge to vah yahi kahegaa ki pakistan ke khilaaf khilne main majaa aata he
 But the series that took place earlier was possible only after the approval of the government and whatever decision the government will make, it will do in the best interest of the country
 ’yuvaraj singh or ashish nehra ne australia daure main tii20 siries ke liye team india main vaapasi kii he
 Gambhir was asked when he could return to the Indian team, so he said, 'it depends on the selectors
 meraa kaam cricket khelnaa or apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karnaa he
 He said, 'delhi are in the knockout of Vijay Hazare Trophy and we are focusing on doing well
 prayek khilaadi ko apane desh se nahin khilne kii kami akharati he lekin aap vahi kar sakate ho jo aapke haath main he
 Gambhir was asked if his performance in odis and T20s in Australia would be affected by playing on the spinners' helpful pitches against South Africa
 He said, "it's a different format

 gandhi parivaar ke damaad robert wadra in dinon khaase sakriy najar aa rahe hai
 Sometimes they are seen feeding langar to the poor, worshiping in Hanuman temple on Hanuman Jayanti

 Balmiki goes to the temple before his birthday and takes blessings
 ab mangalvaar ko ve apane janmdin ke din apane offis ke baahar garib buzurg mahilaon ke saath kek katkar or unako lungar khilaakar unka aashirwad lete najar aaye
 On all these occasions, Robert tries to stay away from media questions
 lekin khud tasviren soshal media par post kar dete hai
 The report of the Shunglu Committee was submitted to the Supreme Court before Robert's birthday
 laazmi tha ki, robert agar garib bujurg mahilaon ke bich aaenge to media ke sawaalon se bhi rou-ba-rou hona padegaa
 However, Robert did not postpone his schedule, he stayed for about half an hour
 baad main media ke sawaalon par khamosh rahe, par camera hataane par saaf kaha, "aaj meraa janmdin he, is din main aapse koi or baat nahin karnaa chahta, haa kek khaaiye, mere saath janmdin main shariq hone kaa shukriya
 "but, along with Robert's latest move and the pictures he is posting on social media, his views on all social and political issues are constantly being posted
 kya samajaseva ke jariye raajnneeti kii taraf kadam badhaane kii robert kii shuruyaat he? aakhir dakshin bharatiyon ko lekar tarun vijay par tikhaa hamalaa sansad main maamla uthne se pehle hi robert kar chuke the
 In such a situation, even if he wants to be imprisoned in the image of his social worker, but in 12 states of the country, his personal and Congress supporters got big posters in the name of birthday

 There is no saying that smoke does not come out without fire
 kul milakar robert aaj 18 april 2017 ko 48 saal ke ho gaye
 Amidst all the controversies, this year he started trying to make his image as a social worker, all the recent activities are indicating his interest in politics
 lekin ye to tay he ki, sabase pehle robert ko vivaadon se ubarna hoga
 After all, he has always been calling himself innocent, he has been saying that, no court has convicted him
 lekin virodhiyon ke gambhir aaropon ke chalate vakt kii maang to yahi he ki, unako saamne aakar khulkar khud par lage ek-ek aarope kaa jawaab or safai deni chahie
 However, his close says that by accusing him for political gains only in elections, he and the Congress's image is hurt or else there is BJP government from Haryana, Rajasthan to the Center for 3 years, why action against Robert But he could not be convicted
 khayr, ye to rahi siyaasi baat

 Before the Lok Sabha elections, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has made a big promise regarding the smart city plan of Modi government

 Just before the election, Rahul Gandhi advocated a direct election for mayor
 unka maananaa he ki pratyaksh chunaav se jo meyar 5 saal ke liye chunakar aaenge, ve hi shaharon ko smart banane main kargar sabit ho sakate hai
 Just before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP promised to make 100 cities smart
 magar 98 shaharon ko sarkaar ne flagship project ke liye chunaa, jisamen prayek ke liye 500 karod rupee aavantit kiye gaye
 Critics say that progress in the project has been very slow
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne twit kiya 'asli smart city achche netaaon dwaara banaayi jaati hai
 We will directly work with elected mayors and elected councils for 5 years to improve living standards in cities
 prashasan visheshgyon kii bahuddeshiy tiimon dwaara sanchalit kiya jayega
 These teams will be accountable to the Mayor and Councils
 'real smart cities are built by good leaders
 To improve quality of life in our cities we will move to directly elected Mayors with 5 yr terms & elected councils
 Administration will be run by multidisciplinary teams of specialists & experts accountable to the Mayor & council
 Under the Smart Cities project, 20 cities were announced in January 2016, followed by 13 cities in May 2016, 27 cities in September 2016 and 30 cities in June 2017
 99 smart city mishan ke liye kul prastaavit nivesh lagbhag 2
 03 lakh crores
 congress apana ghoshnaptr jari karne ke liye taiyaar he, lekin rahul gandhi pichley maheene se hi apni mukhya visheshtaon ko apane twitor acount se saajha kar rahe hai
 Earlier, Rahul Gandhi has promised to give 72 thousand rupees annually to 20 percent of the poorest families of the country under the scheme of justice ie minimum income guarantee scheme
 chunaav se pehle vaadon kii fehrist main rahul gandhi kaa yah vaada sabase charchaa main he
 Apart from this, Rahul Gandhi has made another big promise
 somvaar ko rahul gandhi ne vaada kiya kiy agar unki sarkaar satta main aati he to mahaj 10 maheene ke bheetar 22 lakh sarkari vaikency ko unki sarkaar puraa karegi
 Rahul Gandhi will release the Congress manifesto on Tuesday
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki party ke ghoshnaptr main smart city banane par jor hoga yaa nahin
 The Congress manifesto may have a number of major promises from the debt waiver of the farmer, the abolition of the NITI Aayog, to the Dalits and the Obosi communities
