 yah khabar ek aisi khabar he, jiske liye ham yahi kahenge ki kaash ye khabar hoti hi nahin
 Or this news would have been a lie
 magar yah khabar ek khaufnak sach he
 In a house in Amritsar, there was such a crime at the hands of a mother that the hearts of those who heard and saw it were shaken
 khaufnak vaardaatmaamla punjab ke amritsar kaa he
 It is said that the most secure place for a child is the mother's lap
 dedh saal kaa maasoom harman bhi aisa hi samajhataa hoga
 He also used to bruise in the mother's lap with caress
 kabhi apni maa kii ankhon kaa suraj chand tha harman
 But one cannot imagine the truth with which Harman faced in the life of one and a half years, even in the worst of nightmares
 maasoom ko jinda jalayouse din jab maa balajit cor ne harman ke upar pani jaisi koi cheez daali to wo ise maa kaa pyaar bharaa gussa hi samaj rahaa tha
 How would the mother's stone eyes know the reality of a one and a half year old child
 lekin us beraham maa ne apane jigar ke tukade par jalati hui tili phenk di
 And innocent Harman was engulfed in flames
 jalte hue maa ko pukaarata rahaa masumvo beraham maa to apane laal ko jalaane chali thi lekin wo maasoom jalte-jalte bhimanko hi pukaar rahaa tha
 How can a mother have such a stone heart to see a child burning
 magar use beraham maa ne aisa hi kiya
 She kept watching her child walking
 or jab uski maut kii tasalli ho gai, tab madad ke liye shor machaaya
 The crime in front of the police reached Kabulamamala police
 police ko ghar main bachche ke jal jane kii baat hajam nahin ho rahi thi
 Therefore, the police strictly questioned the mother who was there at the time of the accident
 or wo maa sach ko apane seene main zyada der tak nahin dabaa saki
 He confessed his crime in police interrogation
 pati ke shaq ne banaaya kaatilaaropee maa balajit cor police ke saamne tut chuki thi
 He had confessed his crime
 usne police ke saamne jab sara maajaraa bataaya ko police vaale bhi sakate main aa gaye
 Baljeet Kaur said that her husband did not consider Harman as her son
 or berahami se uski pitayee karata tha
 She was living separately from her husband for the last four months
 rishton kii jhulasati aag main hi usne apane maasoom bachche kii bali chadha di
 False accusations were imposed on the neighbors
 pi
 Crime Lakhbir Singh said that Baljit Kaur had falsely accused the neighbors of burning the child first, but later confessed to the crime on strictness
 police ne balajit cor ko giraftaar kar adaalat main pesh kiya
 From where he was sent to jail considering his crime as a serious crime
 balajit cor or uske pati ke rishton kaa sach chaahe jo bhi ho
 But the painful death of one and a half year old Harman is such a scary truth that which is beyond the logic of any circumstances and helplessness
 pakistani taliban ne champion cricketer sachin tendulkar ke bare main apane bayaan par safai dete hue kaha he ki jo log maare gaye ugravadiyon ko shahid maanane ke khilaaf hai, ve thik usee tarah ke log hai jo tendulkar kii isliye tarif nahin karnaa chaahate kyonki vah bhartiya he

 Shahid's statement was accepted by the media as an opposition to Tendulkar's praise
 unhone kaha, 'kuch log kah sakate hai ki tendulkar bhale hi bahut acha khilaadi he, lekin uski tarif mat karo kyonki yah pakistan ke naagarik ko shobhaa nahin detaa
 These people will say that no matter how bad a player Misbah is, but praise him because he is Pakistani
 ' Shahid said, 'those criticizing Munawwar Hassan are also behaving in a similar way
 ' Shahid clearly stated that he had cited the example of Tendulkar by referring to media coverage of the controversy over Munawar's statement
 mahsood 1 november ko america drone hamale main maaraa gaya tha
 He said that Pakistani soldiers fighting s for the US are called martyrs while Taliban fighting for Islam are not
 pakistani media ne tendulkar ke vidaai bhaashan kaa sidhaa prasaaran kiya
 The newspapers praised him, saying that his lack would eat cricket badly
 tendulkar ne 1989 main pakistan ke khilaaf hi pehla test khelaa tha

 sabhi unase bepanaah muhabbat karte hai or unki izzat karte hai
 At the same time, the Express Tribune and Daily Times called him the perfect batsman

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday targeted him fiercely as he was "upset" over the patriotism of the Congress and its leaders
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki unhen kam se kam uttar karnataka ke mudhol kutton se sikh leni chahie, jinhen bhartiya sena main shaamil kiya gaya he
 Modi said that there has been such a decline in the Congress that a leader of the party went among the people shouting slogans like "india will be pieces"
 vah jahiraa taur par congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay (jeenyu) parisar kii us yatra kaa zikr kar rahe the, jab parisar main kathith taur par deshvirohi naare lagane ko lekar vivaad paidaa ho gaya tha
 Prime Minister Modi said in the election rally, "when there is a discussion about patriotism in the country, when there is a discussion about patriotism, national anthem Vande Mataram, some people get upset
 ’’ modi ne kaha ki deshbhakti ke kaaran desh ko swatantraaa mili or "aaj agar hamane deshbhakti ke aadhaar par vikaas kaa ek bada abhiyaan shuru kiya he, to congress or uske saathiyon ko deshbhakti main sajeesh najar aati he
 They get upset about patriotism
 "unhone kaha ki kya kisi ne sochaa hoga ki aazaadee ke baad congress is had tak gir jaaegi ki aaj congress netaa un logon ke bich ja rahe hai jo ‘‘bharat ke tukade honge’’ jaise naare lagaate hai
 He said that the Congress and its leaders had fallen so much that when the Indian Army carried out a surgical strike across the border, they asked for proof
 modi ne kaha, ‘‘deshbhakti ke naam se jinhen pareshaani hoti he, jo deshbhakti kii charchaa ke khilaaf hai or jinke liye deshbhakti pareshaani kaa kaaran he, main unhen kahana chahta hum ki agar aap dusron se siikhnaa nahin chaahate hai, to kripaya nahin seekhen- chaahe ve aapke purvaj hon yaa mahatma gandhi kii congress ho
 He said that at least try to learn from the Mudhol dogs of Bagalkote
 unka ishaara haal hi bhartiya sena main shaamil kiye gaye mudhol kutton se tha
 Modi said, "I know that his (congress) ego has reached the seventh sky
" desh ke logon ne unhen nakaar diya he, lekin ve ab bhi jameen par aane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 So i do not expect them to learn anything from Mudhol dogs
 ’’ mudhol hound bhartiya nasl ke kute hai
 The dastardly act that Pakistan did by attacking the Indian Army in Poonch on Tuesday created a ruckus in India
 raksha mantri e ke antni ko sansad main bayaan dena padaa
 However, his statement also caused a lot of ruckus
 unhone apane bayaan main sidhe-sidhe pakistani sena par aarope lagane kii bajaay kaha tha ki hamale main shaamil log pakistani sena kii uniform main the
 The information we have received from sources raises many questions
 jaankaree ke anusaar, sena ke diji (military oparations) leftinent general vinod bhaatia ne raksha mantri antni ko ghatana kaa vistaar se byora diya tha
 AK Antony was specifically told that the attack was carried out by the Border Action Team (BAT), which included Pakistani military and armed militants
 padhein:'antni ne to pakistan ko bachane kaa rasta de diya'is byore ke baad bhi jab e ke antni ne sansad main bhaashan diya to unhone hamalaavaron kaa zikr 'pakistani sena kii uniform main log' ke rup main kiya
 The BJP opposed this in Parliament and said that we ourselves have given a way to Pakistan to escape
 lekin, raksha mantri dwaara is tarah se badalakar bayaan dena, wo bhi sena ke afasar kii brifing ke baad, kitna sahi he, is par sawaal uthne lage hai-- pehla sawaal to yah he ki kya vaaki e ke antni ne apni spich ko sensor kiya
 Why did he need it? —if he changed his speech then why
 iske peeche kya kaaran the?-sena kii brifing ko darkinar kyon kar diya gaya?-pakistan or pakistan kii sena ke liye kya hamaare raksha mantri narm ravaiya apanaate hai? a new twist has come in the phone tapping scandal involving the multinational company Essar Group
 tanping ke aaropon se jujh rahe group ke purv karmchaaree albasit khan ne naatakeey dhang se khud ko maamle se na sirf alag kar liya he, balki yahaan tak kaha ki unhone kabhi maamle kaa khulaasa karne vaale ore piemo se shikaayat karne vaale vakil suren uppal ko hair nahin kiya
 Uppal claimed to be Khan's lawyer
 managasaint kahani se ugaahi kii koshishpanch saal tak desh ke sabase ahm maane jane vaale logon kephone tanpingkarwane ke aaropon se ghire khan ne 'indian express' se kaha ki uppal managasaint kahani kah rahe hai or corporate digagjon se ugaahi karnaa chaahate hai
 Khan said that he never hired Uppal
 uppal ne kaha- khan se sampark ke kai saboot hainvahin phone tanping ke khulaase or piemo se isaki shikaayat karne vaale vakil suren uppal ne kaha ki khan ke bayaan se unhen koi hairat nahin hui
 He was already aware of it
 unhone kaha ki mere paas is baat ke tamaam saboot hai ki khan unase sidhe sampark main the or is tanping kaa khulaasa karne ke liye bhi donon saath kaam kar rahe the
 What is the whole case: The group is accused of multinational company Essar Group that tapped the phone of several cabinet ministers of NDA and UPA government as well as business giants like Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani from 2001 to 2006
 jin logon ke phone tap kiye gaye unamem atal bihari vaajapeyi ke vakt ke piemo adhikari bhi shaamil hai
 In the 29-page complaint report sent to the PMO, it has been claimed that Supreme Court lawyer Suren Uppal has sent a 29-page complaint to the PMO on 1 June
 uppalaessar samoohake us karmchaaree ke vakil hai, jis par kathith taur par phone tanping kaa aarope he
 It is said that Pramod Mahajan, a minister in the NDA government, was also tapped
 kuch phone tanping telecom licencing ke silsile main hui thi
 Suresh Prabhu, Praful Patel's phone also received tap Were done
 iske saath hi sapa netaa amar singh, tatkaaleen grih sachiv rajeev maharishi, IDBI bank ke purv chairman peepi
 Vohra, former CEO of IDBI Bank and MD KV
 kamath or isi bank kii purv javointint managing diarector lalita gupte kaa phone bhi tap kiya gaya
 The ongoing litigation on Essar in the 2G case is a matter of concern that Essar is facing trial in the 2G allocation scam case
 samajha jaataa he ki phone kii tanping se satta kii dallali, kaarobaar main bhrashtachar, sarkaar or kaarobaariyon ke bich deal or aise hi kai gahare raaj par essar kii najar thi
 The hearing on the phone tapping in the Supreme Court is the special thing that a public interest litigation is currently going on in the Supreme Court, in which the Essar Group is accused of tapping the phones of some politicians, bureaucrats and journalists for their benefit
 piiel centre kii taraf se daayar kii gai he
 However, the company says that it has done nothing wrong
 essar ke jis purv karmchaaree par tanping kaa aarope laga he uskaa naam he albasit khan
 Uppal is his lawyer
 do maheene pehle unhone essar group or kuch duusare korporates ko ek notice bhi bheja tha
 Prashant and Ravikant Ruia had said for taping 'according to Suresh Uppal, Khanesar was the security head of the group and he did the phone tapping at the behest of his top management
 vah bataate hai 2001 main essar ke prashanth or ravikant ruiya ne use phone telecom license se jude maamle main phone tanping karne ko kaha tha
 Uppal's complaint also mentions the numbers whose phones were tapped
 aaropon kii jaanch honi chahie: essngreji akhbaar ke mutabik, is puure vivaad par essar group kaa kahana he ki sabhi facts or aaropon kii jaanch kii jaani chahie
 The allegations in the citation notice are also baseless and false
 ham is bare main jawaab denge
 In the citation notice sent by Uppal, it has been said that Khan's drug enforcement background was there
 iske baavjood prashanth ruiya ne use company kaa sicurity head bana diya
 Khan was the security head of Essar from 2001 to 2011

 naagarikta sansodhan vidheyak sansad se pasbijepi ke ghoshnaa patr ke teen vaade hue puredesh kii satta main duusari baar virajman modi sarkaar apane chunavi ghoshnaa patr main kiye gaye vaadon ko lagaataar amalijama pahana rahi he
 The BJP in its 2019 election manifesto promised to remove Article-370 from Jammu and Kashmir, bring citizenship amendment laws and enact laws against triple talaq
 yahi vajah rahi ki modi sarkaar satta main aane ke saat maheene ke andar in teenon bade vaade puure karne ke saath-saath aatankwaad par nakel kasne ke liye yuapie or espiji sanshodhan bill ko paas karaane main kaamyaab rahi he
 Explain that the Narendra Modi government has a majority in the Lok Sabha, but the majority figure in the Rajya Sabha is low
 yahi vajah rahi ki pichley paanch saalon main modi sarkaar koi bada faisla nahin le paa rahi thi
 In the second term of the Modi government, ever since Amit Shah has been given the responsibility of the post of Home Minister, the government has managed to pass one bill after another
 naagarikta sanshodhan bill pasgrih mantri amit shah ne buudhvaar konaagarikta sanshodhan bill ko rajyasabhaamein charchaa or paas karne ke liye pesh kiya to unhone bijepi ghoshnaptr kaa bhi zikr kiya
 Shah said that before the election, we had proposed to bring the Citizenship Amendment Bill to the public, which the public supported
 janadesh se bada kuch bhi nahin ho saktaa
 It is clear that the government is implementing the promise made by its manifesto
 modi sarkaar naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak ko loksabhaa or rajyasabha se paas karaane main kaamyaab rahi he, jiske baad ab afghanistan, pakistan, bangladesh se bharat aae hindu, jain, sikh, buddha, isai, parsi sharnaarthiyon ko naagarikta mil sakegi
 Freedom from triple talaq: The Narendra Modi government came to power for the second time in a row and took the first step to rid Muslim women of triple talaq
 modi sarkaar ne teen talaak ko puri tarah se bain karne or ise aparaadh ghoshit karne hetu 'muslim mahila vivaah adhikaar sangrakshan vidheyak-2019' ko loksabhaa or rajyasabha se paarit karaayaa
 Despite not having a majority in the Rajya Sabha, the Modi government managed to implement this law
 bijepi ne apane chunavi ghoshnaa main patr main ise shaamil kiya tha
 Neutralizing Article-370, in its second term, the most historic decision was taken by Jammu and Kashmir, which has been at the top of the party's priority list since the time of Jana Sangh
 sarkaar nejammu kashmir main anuchhed 370 ko nishprabhavibanane kaa kadam uthaane ke saath-saath rajya ko baantne kaa kaam bhi kiya
 The BJP had been raising the demand for the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir for a long time, but this issue kept evolving every time
 modi sarkaar ne apane duusare kaarykaal ke grahamantri amit shah ne jammu-kashmir se dhara 370 ko jis tarah nishprabhavi bana diya, wo vipaksh ko bhi hairaan kar gaya
 After this decision of Modi government, one country, one legislation and one mark has come into force in Kashmir
 yuapie bill ko karaayaa pasatankwaad par nakel kasne kii disha main modi sarkaar ne 'vidhi viruddh kriyalap nivaaran sanshodhan vidheyak 2019' (yuapie bill) ko loksabhaa or rajyasabha se paas karakar kanoonee amalijama pehanaane kaa kaam kiya he
 After its law, the government can now declare any person a terrorist and can also confiscate his property
 jabaki, isse pehle tak aatankwaad virdohi kanoon main sirf yah praavdhaan tha ki vah kisi samooh ko pratibandhit kar saktaa tha, lekin kisi ko vyaktigat taur par nahin
 SPG Amendment Bill Passmodi Sarkar has managed to pass the Special Protection Group (SPG) Amendment Bill 2019 from Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
 is bill main sirf pradhanmantri ko SPG suraksha dene kaa praavdhaan he or unke alaava koi bhi vishisht vyakti is suraksha kavach kaa hakdaar nahin hoga
 After amendment to this bill, the SPG protection given to members of the Gandhi family and the family of the former Prime Minister has been lifted
 ab ye sirf pradhanmantri rahete hue or pad se hatane ke 5 saal baad vishisht vyakti se bhi yah suraksha waapas lene kaa praavdhaan he

 yah kahani he Do Won Chang kii jo aaj kii taarikh main Forever 21 company ke siio hai or unki company puri duniya main arabon kaa kaarobaar kar rahi he
 However, he was not always in such a situation
 ve dakshin korea kii paidaaish hai or sangharsh ke shuruaati dinon main california ke ek gas philing stesan par gadiyon main gas bharne kaa kaam karte the
 Inspiration from gas filling station
 
 
 Do Won Chang kehete hai ki ve gas stesan par rukne vaali gadiyon main gas bharne ke saath-saath unhen coffee sarv kiya karte the
 He came to America in 1981 with his wife
 unhone vahaan kaam karte hue mahasoos kiya ki gas philing stesan par rukne vaali adhikanthcchhi-achchhigadiyon ke maalik kapadon ke dhandhe se jude the
 Seeing these too, he decided that he would try his hand in this business
 Fashion 21 se Fashion 21 tak kaa safar
 
 
 He opened a store called Fashion 21, a few miles from Lance Angeles, and within a year he started at $ 35,000 and within a year his profit reached $ 70,000
 iske baad ve har chathe maah ek store kholane lage or unhone in stores kaa naam badal kar Forever 21 kar diya
 Today Forever 21 has 600 stores worldwide and their network has spread to 50 countries
 ve apane parivaar ke saath jud kar is puure kaarobaar ko anjaam de rahe hai
 His daughters are important partners in this business
 aaj unke kaarobaar kaa output $4
 4 billion has been reached
 gyaat ho ki ek billian = 100 karod hota he
 After all, what is the secret of his success? Do Won Chang always believes that life is not a race
 isamen safal hone ke liye hamen apnikeemtee energyko store karke rakhana padataa he
 In this era of expensive and designer clothes, they make such clothes which are within the reach of common man
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki unka brands yuva peedi ke bich khaasaa charchit he or ve hi unhen is mukaam tak bhi le gaye hai
 So the next time you see a store of Forever 21 in a mall or shopping complex, take care of the saying that it is coming from the floor on a haemorrhage

 aaj release hui film 'fagali' kii kahani he bachapan ke chaar doston - dev, gaurav, aditya or devi kii, jo har sukh-dukh main ek-duusare ke saath hai
 
 
 They are young, so they have fun, but still everyone has their own dreams
 
 
 ek din ye chaaron ek dukandaar ko sabak sikhaane jate hai, kyonki usne devi ke saath chhedhkhani kii thi
 
 
 Meanwhile, he meets Chautala, a corrupt police officer, who creates turmoil in his life
 
 
 is bhrasht police afasar ke role main hai jimi shergill
 
 
 'fagli' throws light on many social issues - like girls are not safe anywhere, there is corruption in politicians and the system
 
 
 vaise, drugs or sexual abus jaise gambhir vishyon ko bhi film ne uthaaya he
 
 
 In the very first scene of the film, Dev tries to burn himself in front of Delhi's India Gate, but the police saves him
 
 
 dev ne aisa isliye kiya, kyonki uske mutabik aam aadmi kii awaz koi nahin sunata, magar marate hue insaan kii kahani har koi sunata he
 
 
 It is shown in 'fagli' that all friends are with each other in trouble and bad times
 
 
 'fagali' ne bhale hi kai saamaajik muddon ko ujagar karne kii koshish kii ho, magar neeras he
 
 
 The story is scattered throughout, the screenplay is very weak, the film is excessively noisy and the music is also weak
 
 
 boxing main medal jeet chuke vijender singh acting se dil jeetne main naakaam rahe
 
 
 Mohit Marwah and Kiara Advani have done well
 
 
 udhar, chautaala ke role main jimi shergill ne jaan daalane kii bharpoor koshish kii, magar kamazor kahani ke shikaar hokar rah gaye
 
 
 i think maybe writer Rahul Handa and director Kabir Sadanand may have come up with the idea of making films on issues related to the country, society and youth and would like to build the climax in the form of 'rang de Basanti', but feel 'fagli' It seems that both of them got very involved in making it and the idea was lost
 
 
 meri taraf se film kii reating he - 2 star

 Congress party spokespersons have been partnering with a debate on TV channels for a month from May 29
 mumkin he ki ye avadhi ek maheene or bad jaae
 In an unexpected decision after the Lok Sabha election results, the Congress refused to send its spokespersons to debate on TV channels
 congress kii tarah samaajawaadee party ne bhi aisa hi faisla kiya tha
 After the Lok Sabha election results, on 29 May, Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala informed about the decision not to send party spokespersons to the TV debate
 congress ke netaa bataate hai ki pravaktaaon ko tivi dibet main bhejne main par roak ek maheene ke liye or badhaai ja sakati he
 Circumstances are also indicating an increase
 vaise bhi congress main santhnik taur par pherbadal sambhavit hai kyonki party adhyaksh rahul gandhi istife kii peshkash kar chuke hai or apane faisle par adig bhi hai
 Until the issue of the party leadership is resolved, there is no possibility of decision on the matter of the spokespersons
 congress pravaktaa rajeev tyaagi kehete hai, "yadi yah congress party ke liye aatmamanthan kaa daur he to media gharaanon ke liye bhi aatmamanthan kaa daur he
 Questions should be asked
 lekin vipaksh jo sawaal uthaa rahaa he, sarkaar ke viruddh unako bhi media main jagah milani chahie
 The media's job is to ask questions to the government and not to the opposition
 satta paksh se sawaal puche jane se loktantr majboot hota he
 Local questions are left over from further questions

 According to the latest data from the Food Ministry, arhar dal is again becoming expensive

 Arhar dal became the most expensive by Rs 25 per kg in Siliguri, while Rs 13 in Varanasi, Rs 15 in Kota, Rs 10 in Kanpur and Rs 10 per kg in Lucknow
 dilli ke south avenue colony ke khudara vyapaaree ashok khurana kehete hai, "hamen ummid thi ki november ke baad arhar daal kii nai fasal bazaar main aegi or keemten ghatengi
 But Arhar dal is getting expensive by Rs 2-3 every day

 " chintaa sirf daal tak simit nahin he
 According to the latest data available with the Agriculture Ministry, the wheat crop has been sown in about 56 lakh hectares less this year than last year, while the rice crop is about 2 this year as compared to last year
 45 lakh hectare kam ilaake main boyi gai he
 That is, the incidence of production of both rice and wheat is fixed
 iskaa sidhaa matlab ye hua ki pichley saal bazaar main jitna chaaval or gehun pahunchaa tha, is saal usase kam pahonchega
 The comments udhar arhar daal kii keemton main badhotaree se vipaksh ko sarkaar par phir ungali uthaane kaa mauka mil gaya he
 Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh alleged that when the government knew how much arhar dal was consumed every year and how much the yield was, why did the Modi government decide not to import as per requirement
 agar rajyon main ho rahi jamkhori isaki badi vajah he to bijepi-shasit rajyon main daal ke daam kyon nahin kam ho rahe hai? Obviously, despite the efforts of the government, arhar dal is getting expensive again
 jamkhori ke khilaaf karrwai or bade str par aayaat ke baavjood kai shaharon main arhar kii keemten phir bad rahi hai
 Now it will be important to see how the government deals with this crisis

" lekin har rose arhar daal 2-3 rupee mahangi hoti ja rahi he
 
 
 Don't know when the prices will stop
 " The concern is not limited to lentils

 45 lakh hectares have been sown in less area
 yani chaaval or gehun donon kaa utpaadan kaa ghatana tay he
 This simply means that the rice and wheat that reached the market last year will reach less than this year
 tippaniyan On the other hand, the rise in the price of arhar dal has given the opposition a chance to raise its finger again on the government
 congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne aarope lagaaya ki jab sarkaar ko pataa tha ki har saal arhar daal kii khapat kitni he or paidaavaar kitni hui he, to modi sarkaar ne zarurat ke mutabik aayaat karne kaa faisla kyon nahin kiya
 If hoarding in the states is a big reason for this, then why are the prices of pulses not coming down in bjp-ruled states? jaahir he sarkaar kii koshishon ke baavjood phir se arhar daal mahangi ho rahi he
 Despite action against hoarding and large scale imports, pigeon prices are rising again in many cities

 From 2010 to 2018, 22,027 people died due to lightning
 yani har saal ausat 2447 logon kii jaan bijli girane se ja rahi he

 yadi aasmaan main achaanak kam oonchai vaale ghaney kaale or latakate badal dikhen, to maan len ki barish kii pehali boond ke baad kabhi bhi or kahin bhi bijli gir sakati he
 The interval between lightning and the sound of thunder is less than 30 seconds
 agar aapke sir ke bal khadey ho jaaen or aasmaan main gahare aasamaani rang kaa gheraa dikhe, to samaj len ki turant bijli gir sakati he
 Know how to get government compensation
 People affected by lightning must keep FIR and post mortem report for death or loss

 viveka babaaji kii maut ke maamle main gautam vohara ko raahat mil gai he
 While hearing the interim bail application, the court has told the police that Gautam should not be arrested without giving 72 hours notice
 gauratlab he ki mangalvaar ko police ne gautam se saadhe teen ghante lambii poochtacha kii thi, lekin poochtacha ke baad police ne gautam ko clin chit dene se inkaar kar diya or court main gautam kii agrim jamaanat kaa virodh kiya
 Gautam Vohra, a stockbroker by profession and fond of glamor, reached Khar police station in Mumbai with great confidence, but after three and a half hours of marathon questioning, he realized that his difficulties were not over yet
 model viveka babaaji kii maut par pulisia shaq se abhi wo dur nahin hue hai
 On Tuesday, Gautam Vohra reached Khar police station at half past nine
 police pehle se hi sawaalon kaa pulinda lekar taiyaar thi
 The thirty questions that were asked last night, it seems clear that the police are not satisfied with their answers and they want to find out the whole truth from Gautam
 lihaaja ek baar phir police ne poocha- viveka se aapke kya rishte the
 Gautam then repeated the same reply that he had no relation with Viveka except friendship
 kuch or sawaal-jawaab ke baad police 24 june kii raat par aa gai, jo viveka or gautam ke mulaakaat kii aakhri raat thi
 The direct question of the police was - what happened on the night of June 24? Gautam Vohra then repeated the same answer given in the court while filing the anticipatory bail application
 gautam ne kaha ki wo bandra se guzar rahe the, tabhi unhen viveka kaa phone aayaa
 He went to meet Viveka
 viveka tanaav main thi
 He tried to relieve her tension
 wo dher sari davaaiyaan le rahi thi
 Was smoking cigarettes police kaa aglaa sawaal tha- aap kab tak viveka ke paas the?gautam ne kaha- raat paune nau -nau baje ke kareeb wo vahaan se nikal gaye the
 The police then asked - Did you quarrel with them? Gautam said- No, there was no quarrel
 gautam kaa yahi jawaab police ko santusht nahin kar paa rahaa
 Because there are constant reports quoting from neighbors that on the night of 24th June, there were voices of constant fighting fights from Viveka's house and it is suspected that after this quarrel Viveka's idea of suicide came in her mind
 udhar police ne viveka ke esemes kii bhi padtaal kii he
 Viveka had sent many loving messages to Gautam in the last 7 days
 lekin usne 24 june ko esemes main likhaa ai het you
 Police are finding this clue important
 philhal police ko viveka kii visra report ke alaava laptop, mobile, i-mail kii jaanch report kaa intjaar he
 That is why the police are not in the mood to give a clean chit to Gautam at the moment
 yani, viveka babaaji khudakushi cese main gautam par kaayam he shaq kii sui

 Rishabh Pant, who is considered to be Mahendra Singh Dhoni's successor, was questioned by Team India coach Ravi Shastri after a poor performance in all the three formats of international cricket
 haalanki team india ke head coach ravi shastri ne is yuva wicketiper ballebaaj kaa bachaav kiya he
 Coach Shastri says that wicketkeeper batsman Rishabh Pant is a world class player and the team management will give him all possible support to succeed in international cricket
 bataa den ki haal ke dinon main rishabh pant ballebaaji main flop sabit ho rahe hai
 The way Rishabh Pant has been losing wickets, the team management also warned him
 lekin ab coach shastri ne hindustan times se kaha, 'pant alag hai, vah world class hai or ek krur match vijeta hai
 Talking about ODI and T20, there are very few players like Pant in the world, i cannot even count on those five players on fingers
 'shastri ne kaha, 'sabhi media reports or visheshgyon ke lekhan (ke baavjood) pant bhartiya team ke saath badhiya sthiti main hai
 This is the work of experts, they can speak
 pant ek vishesh khilaadi he or usne pehle hi bahut kuch kiya he or vah seekhenge, ye team management unka samarthan karegaa
 Earlier, Shastri himself had criticized Pant for shot selection in difficult situations
 ravi shastri ne kaha tha ki rishabh pant agar apni galatiyon ko doharaate rahenge, to unhen iskaa khamiyaja bhugatna padegaa
 To this, Shastri said, 'I had said to bear the brunt of making a mistake', if anyone makes a mistake, i will tell him
 kya main vahaan sirf tabalaa bajaane ke liye hum? lekin ye khilaadi world class he, ye khilaadi vidhvasank ho saktaa he or visphotak bhi
 We will give him all the support he needs to shine in international cricket
 'shastri ne kaha, 'yah mat kahie kii team prabandhan, pant ke pradarshan ke kaaran maine wo bayaan diya tha
 If someone makes a mistake, i need to tell him
 lekin yah khilaadi world class he, yah khilaadi kisi bhi gendbaaji kram kii dhajjiyaan uda saktaa he
 We have to support him so that he can do better in international cricket
 'sunil gavaskar ne diya tha pant kaa saathpurv bhartiya captain sunil gavaskar ne agle saal australia main hone vaale tii-20 world cap se pehle rishabh pant ko zyada se zyada maukey dene kii baat kahi he
 Gavaskar said, now we need to look beyond Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 kam se kam meri team main mahendra singh dhoni shaamil nahin hai
 If you are talking about T20 World Cup, then i would definitely think of Rishabh Pant

 amit shah ne kaha tha ki chunaav nattejey aane ke baad rajyapal kii ore se 18 dinon kaa samay sarkaar banane ke liye diya gaya, lekin koi bhi dal bahumat sabit nahin kar paaya
 Then, even if it is the Bharatiya Janata Party

 ) Nowadays many of us are angry at the fact that the prices of petrol and diesel could be reduced, they are not being reduced
 ye shikaayat vaazib bhi he kyonki sarkaar exise duty badhaati ja rahi he
 Excise duty is the tax that is charged at the cost of crude oil after making petrol or diesel
 november se ab tak sarkaar chaar baar exise duty badha chuki he
 If this increase did not happen then petrol 7
 75 paise prati litre or dijal 6
 50 paisa per liter could have been cheaper
 exise duty iconomi ke liye jarurbhi dilli main sarkaar ek litre petrol par 8
 95 and 7 on diesel
 96 rupee exise duty ke naam par vasuul rahi he
 With the increase in excise duty four times, the central government is expected to earn extra Rs 20 thousand crore this year
 ye sara paisa sarkari khajaane main ja rahaa he
 For the central government, this money is like a lottery, because it reduces the deficit of the public exchequer to 4 of GDP
 1% tak laane kaa target puraa kar sakati he
 This means that the increased excise tax on petrol and diesel is coming to strengthen the economy of the country
 iconomi kii haalat sudharegi to phayda desh or janata kaa hi hoga
 Now there is no subsidy on oil
 Many people are also arguing that when crude oil used to be around $ 50 in July 2004, petrol was sold at Rs 35-36 / liter
 aaj itnaa mahangaa kyon he? lekin ye baat bhi ardhsaty he
 Then the government used to give a hefty amount of subsidy on petrol and diesel
 uski vajah se keemten aaj ke mukaable kam hoti thim
 This amount of subsidy did not come from anywhere else but from the tax collected from the public
 matlab ye ki tab jo log gaadi nahin chalaate the, wo bhi amiron kii gaadi main jalane vaale tel kaa kharch uthaate the
 Thankfully, today the subsidy on both petrol and diesel is over
 bharat main petrol pakistan se mahangaa kyon?siyaasi phaayde ke liye aksar kuch partiyaan daleel de rahi hai ki bharat main pakistan, srilanka or nepal ke mukaable bhi mahangaa tel bik rahaa he
 This is true, but there is a valid reason for this
 pakistan ho yaa koi doosraa dakshin asian desh, vahaan jo petrol yaa dijal bik rahaa he wo quality ke hisaab se bharat main 10-15 saal pehle bikne vaale tel jaisaa he
 Today, Euro-3 and Euro-4 standards are applicable in India, which reduce pollution and are suitable for new technology trains
 bharat main bikne vaale tel kii tulana pakistan se to katai nahin kii ja sakati
 Not only this, it is the result of irresponsible attitude of the Government of Pakistan that the state oil companies there are on the verge of bankruptcy and the whole country is facing petrol crisis
 sasta tel musiibat bhi ban saktaa he10 saal pehle sadakon par gadiyon kii sankhya aaj ke mukaable aadhi se bhi kam thi
 At that time, even though petrol was Rs 35 a liter, but people's spending capacity was also much less than today
 aap khud kalpana kiijie ki agar aaj petrol 35 rupee kilo ho jaae to kya hoga
 The number of vehicles on the roads in cities will suddenly be manifold, which will be impossible to control
 in gadiyon kii vajah se paryaavaran ko jo nuksaan hoga wo alag
 This is also the reason behind the petrol crisis in Pakistan
 vahaan saste petrol kii vajah se log sienji chhod gaadiyaan petrol par chalaane lage, jisase achaanak petrol kii demand bahut bad gai
 The deception of the decreasing price of crude oil is right that the international price of crude oil has come down by about 60 per cent to $ 50 per barrel today, but we have to remember that the distributing companies deal in crude oil 6-8 She has done it for months in advance
 yani aaj bhale hi kaccha tel sasta ho gaya he ki lekin is vakt jo tel kharida ja rahaa he wo ho saktaa he ki 6 maheene puraane rate par ho
 In such a situation, the oil companies have a problem as to how to make the benefits of falling prices available to the public
 kachche tel ke daam ghatane par tel companiyon ko puraane ghate kii bharpai na karne dene kaa hi nateeja pakistan bhugat rahaa he, jahaan aajkal log petrol ke liye ghanton-ghanton line lagaakar khadey ho rahe hai
 Obviously you will never want this situation in India
 petrol or dijal ke daam kachche tel ke hisaab se kam hote rahen, ye jaruri he lekin ye giravat itani zyada bhi nahin honi chahie ki nae tarah kii samasyaayein paidaa ho jaaen
 If the government is trying to control the price of petrol and diesel by increasing excise duty under a thoughtful strategy, then there should be no harm in this

 Not only this, all security forces are working with better coordination to stop anti-national activities in Jammu and Kashmir
 isi talmail kaa nateeja he ki jammu-kashmir main halaat pehle kii tulana main kaaphi behatar hue hai
 Eight CRPF jawans gave up their lives for the sake of peace and it is time that all forces work together so that there is minimum loss of self and it is happening
 kisi oparation ke credit ke liye suraksha balon ke bich main kheenchaatani kaa to sawaal hi nahin paidaa hota
 The army questioned the media reports that are talking about a credit conflict between the CRPF and the army
 vipareet halaat main jis tareeke se suraksha bal or khufia agenciyaan kaam kar rahi hai, aise main is tarah ke sawaal khadey karne kaa koi matlab nahin he
 The comments gauratlab he ki shanivaar ko pampor main hue aatanki hamale main aatankiyon ko kisne maaraa isko lekar bavaal shuru hua tha
 The army first claimed that it killed the terrorists, then later said that it was a joint operation of the army and the CRPF
 baad main somvaar ko siarpief ke diji ke durga prasad ne kaha ki aatankiyon ko siarpief ke javaanon ne maaraa

 From Narayanan to junior minister Jairam Ramesh and his assistant in the Prime Minister's Office, Prithviraj Chavan, everyone felt that his loyalty was to Sonia Gandhi

 His 59-year-old media advisor Sanjay Baru had known Manmohan for over two decades

 When Manmohan is ready to step down as Prime Minister after taking over the reins of the world's largest and most complex democracy for ten years, then Sanjay Baru's book The Accidental Prime Minister: The Making and Unmaking of Manmohan Singh seems like the norm in which Gone is what not to do in power
 media main ubhaare jane kii salaah kaa sakhti se virodh, 2009 main loksabhaa chunaav ladgaye se inkaar, pramukh niyuktiyaan apane sir ke upar hone dene kii chhot dekar sarkaar par niyantran chhodia or saare aam rahul gandhi ke haathon apamaanit hone ke baavjood pad na chhodia
 Baru says that the legacy that Manmohan is leaving is not in fact his destiny
 baru ne pradhanmantri kii tulana bhishma pitamah se kii he, jinhone singhaasana kii raksha karne kii atoot shapath lee thi
 He said that Belaus loyalty to the dynasty must have been the responsibility of Bhishma Pitamah in a monarchy, but it proved to be a very dangerous mistake for Manmohan

 (sanjay Baru with Manmohan Singh) Excerpts from Sanjay Baru's book: "the Prime Minister's Principal Secretary was not weighed in the bureaucrat" The strength and importance of the Prime Minister's Principal Secretary depends on the credibility of his administrative service and He has a lot of influence in politics
 darasal pradhan sachiv vah afasar he jo pradhanmantri or baaki mantriyon ke bich prashasnic sethu kaa kaam karata he
 And when needed, it becomes a link between the secretaries of the rest of the departments and the PM

 Looking at the past, most of the Principal Secretaries have been very sharp men who received full respect from both their rulers and subordinates

 K

 Nair could never become the Principal Secretary as he had before
 vaise nair se ekadam pehle brijesh mishra pradhan sachiv tak hi simit nahin the
 i once jokingly told Doctor Singh that during Vajpayee, the Principal Secretary used to act as if he were the Prime Minister, whereas Prime Minister Singh was said to be acting as Principal Secretary
 yah kathan har baariki par gaur karne, prashasan ke har chote kaam main dakhal dene or adhikariyon ke saath lambii thakaaoo baithkon kii adhyakshata karne kii doctor singh kii aadat ke bare main tha
 Vajpayee used to do this very rarely
 doctor singh ne is baat ko ansuna kar diya
 He was well aware that this satire is arrows, proving that the political boss was Sonia
 nair, pradhan sachiv ke pad ke liye doctor singh kii pehali pasand nahin the
 They wanted to take Vohra, who informed me of my appointment
 vohara na sirf ab pakistan kaa hissaa ban chuke pashchimi punjab ke humsafar sharnaarthi the, balki donon ne punjab vishvavidhyalay main padhaayaa bhi tha
 Vohra also visited Oxford a few years after Doctor Singh
 vohara ne to piemo main kaam karne ke liye landan kii apni yatra bhi radd kar di thi
 However, i am not allowed to mention the name of another retired Tamil IAS officer in the mind of Sonia Gandhi
 unhone rajeev gandhi ke saath kaam kiya tha or unki chhavi kaabil or eemaandaar afasar kii thi
 He in principle turned down Sonia's invitation to rejoin the government, as he had promised his father that he would no longer do a government job after retiring
 in donon pratishthit adhikariyon kaa naam katane ke baad doctor singh ne nair kaa rukh kiya
 Before retiring, Nair was the Prime Minister's secretary during Gujral's tenure and was also the Chief Secretary of Punjab
 nair ke naam kaa doctor singh ke paariwarik mitra rakshpal malhotra ne jabardast samarthan kiya tha
 Malhotra was the president of the Center for Research on Rural and Industrial Development (CRRIID) in Chandigarh
 doctor singh khud uske adhyaksh rah chuke the or nair sanchaalak mandal ke sadsy the
 Barring Gujral's PMO work, Nair never held the post of secretary in a powerful ministry like Home, Finance and Defense, nor did he hold any major economic ministry
 ve sirf gramin vikaas or paryaavaran tathaa van jaise kam taqatvar mantralayon main sachiv rahe the
 Meaning he had less weight in the bureaucracy
 nate kad ke nair hameshaa saje-dhaje rahete the, lekin unka kad brijesh mishra jaisaa na tha
 Mishra's overbearing personality caught attention
 nair kisi bhi file par shaayad hi koi spasht yaa diler raay dete the or hameshaa kripaya charchaa karen likhakar dastakhat kar dete the
 He preferred to give verbal instructions to junior officers like Joint Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries
 phir maatahat afasaron ko in nirdeshon ko apni salaah ke rup main file par likhnaa hota tha
 It is a bureaucratic way of avoiding risks, so as to never get caught in any controversy or trouble
 nair ahm nitigat faislon ke liye sanyukt sachiv pulak chatarji par bahut nirbhar rahete the, jo rajeev or sonia gandhi ke saath kaam kar chuke the
 Pulak too, like Nair, suffered from the sorrow that his own service never brought him prestige
 maujuuda iees adhikari pulak ne kabhi kisi bade mantralay main kaam nahin kiya
 He was noticed by Rajiv Gandhi as a District Officer in his constituency Amethi in Uttar Pradesh and later became Deputy Secretary in Rajiv's PMO
 rajeev kii mrityu ke baad unhone rajeev gandhi foundation main kaam karnaa pasand kiya or kuch acha saamaajik vikaas kaa kaam kiya, lekin iskaa matlab yah hua ki unka naam puri tarah se gandhi parivaar ke saath jud chukaa tha
 Pulak's return to government came in the private staff of Sonia Gandhi when she was the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha
 pulak sonia gandhi kii sifarish par piemo main shaamil hue
 He met Sonia almost daily and briefed her on the policy issues of that day
 pulak hi vah shaks the jo pradhanmantri karyaalay se manjuur hone vaali pramukh filon par sonia gandhi se nirdesh lete the
 In fact, Pulak was the most important link of regular contact between the Prime Minister and Congress President Sonia
 ve sonia gandhi kii adhyakshata vaali rashtriya salaahkaar parishad ke liye bhi piemo main mukhya sampark the
 Despite this mixed strength, i felt that the pairing of Nair and Pulak did not stand in front of Brijesh Mishra
 brijesh mishra ne vaajapeyi ke pradhanmantri karyaalay ko bahut acchhee tarah chalaaya
 Mishra, the son of the former Congress Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, may have taken diplomacy training, but politics was in his blood and he knew very well what tricks would be done to increase the dominance of the Prime Minister in the coalition government
 mishra kii ek or sabase badi khaasiyat thi
 They were not afraid to take risks
 vahiin nair or pulak, donon hi afasaron main is jaruri gun kii kami thi
 On delicate occasions of politics and administration, Mishra was ready to take a decision and pursue the matter on behalf of the Prime Minister
 kisi pradhanmantri ke liye yah sabase badi sahuuliyat hoti he
 He earned this name in May 1998 with Vajpayee's decision to conduct a nuclear test and declare India a nuclear weapon
 mishra kii haisiyat ne sarkaar ke bheetar vaajapeyi kaa dabadabaa badhaayaa or majboot kiya
 But Nair never achieved this status

 Singh had a better relationship with him (mani Dixit), who had never been with Narayanan
 yah bhi lag rahaa tha ki sonia ke prati sammaan vyakt karne ke liye narayanan ko piemo main teesri shakti ke rup shaamil kiya gaya tha
 MK or Mike, as his contemporaries used to call him, had been the head of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), the country's internal intelligence agency, under both Rajiv Gandhi and Narasimha Rao

 In fact, Narayanan himself had rubbished such rumors that he is looking for a peek at everyone
 mujhe yah bataakar ve kaaphi khush lag rahe the ki ve sabhi prabhaavshaalee sampadakon ke credit card se kharch par najar rakhte hai

 He is the first Prime Minister to do so
 iske badale ibi or research and analysis wing (ro) ke pramukhon ko rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar (enese) se milane ko kaha gaya
 i do not think that the head of the intelligence agencies would have told all the news correctly to anyone other than the Prime Minister and he insisted on daily briefing directly from the Prime Minister
 kabhi-kabhi pradhanmantri is tarah kii brifing lete the, lekin asal main rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar hi unke bos ban gaye the
 When Narayanan was made NSA in place of Dixit, he used this right to an extent

 *** "strict on himself in terms of morality but lynching attitude on others" Manmohan kept a close eye on the corruption of his colleagues i think that Manmohan Singh adopted the same attitude towards corruption in public life
 yahi ki ve khud to shuchita ke oonche maandand apanaae rahenge lekin use dusron par nahin thopenge
 In other words, they are not corrupt at all and also take care that no close family of theirs should ever do anything wrong, but they do not hold themselves accountable for the wrongs of their companions and subordinates
 is maamle main ve khud ko kuch kamatar maanate the kyonki un logon ko mantri pad par niyukt karne vaale rajnatik adhikari ve nahin the
 This practically meant that they kept their eyes closed on the misdeeds of their ministers
 unhen congress party ke netritv se ummid thi ki vah unki sarkaar ke daagiyon par karrwai karegaa
 In the same way, he wanted the allies to tackle their tainters

 The so-called differences in the PMO on the MNREGA and the Ministry of Finance on the one hand, and the NAC on the other, were mainly on the financial aspects of the program as to how much extra burden it would impose on the treasury

 The Congress party's frenzy of giving the entire MGNREGA credit to the Gandhi family had reached such an extent that even the Gandhi family itself might have hesitated
 jab maine ise sudhaarney kii koshish kii to main ek musiibat main funs gaya
 On September 26, 2007, just a few days after he was appointed Congress General Secretary, Rahul Gandhi accompanied a delegation to Dr
 singh ko unke janmdin par badhai dene pahunche
 After having breakfast, the delegation sat down to discuss policies and issues
 meeting ke ant main sonia ke rajnatik sachiv ahamed patel ne meeting ke bare main ek tippanee likhakar ise press main jari karne ko kaha
 It claimed that Rahul Gandhi requested the Prime Minister to increase the scope of NREGA (it was known by this name before Mahatma Gandhi's name was added) to 500 rural districts of the country
 tab yah desh ke 200 behad pichde jilon main hi lagu kii jaati thi
 i told Patel that there is no rule in the PMO to issue a press statement on behalf of leaders visiting the Prime Minister
 maine yah bhi kaha ki main khud ek statement taiyaar karuunga ki rahul gandhi ke netritv main party sachivon kaa ek pratinidhimandal pradhanmantri ko shubhakamanaayen dene aayaa
 As far as the political part of the statement is concerned, i suggested that better, such a statement should be issued from the party office
 us shaam baad main indian express ke ek varisht patrkaar ne mujhe phone kar yah jaanane kii koshish kii ki kya dow
 Singh has accepted Rahul's suggestion that NREGA coverage will be spread across the country
 maine unhen yaad dilaayaa ki pradhanmantri apane swatantraaa diwas ke bhaashan main isaki patibaddhta dikhaa chuke hai or yah bhi ki piemo is maamle main gramin vikaas mantralay or vitt mantralay se baat kar rahaa he
 The same evening, TV channels presented the Congress party's statement with great enthusiasm that Rahul has requested the Prime Minister to take NREGA across the country
 agali subah samachar patron man bhi yah khabar chhapi dikhaai di
 Only Indian Express added additional matter to its news
 "according to sources, this matter was in the attention of PMO even before Rahul Gandhi came to the party post
 pradhanmantri ke mukhya sachiv vitt mantralay, gramin vikaas mantralay or yojana ayog se do hafte pehle is par vichaar kar chuke hai
 "in excitement, i sent an SMS to a journalist who wanted to know about the national nature of the program, that the announcement was a gift to the country on his birthday on the Prime Minister
" aakhirkaar yadi sonia yaa rahul desh ke pradhanmantri hote to party kii aisi hi ranneeti hoti or netaa ke janmdin par aisi ghoshnaa hoti
 Later i came to know that he roamed the SMS to the party leadership
 ek varisht netaa ne ek sampadak se kaha, ‘‘yah baru kya sochataa he? uske khyaal se doctor sahib hamen chunaav jitwa sakate hai? ham rahulji kii chhavi nikhaarana chaahate hai, or is tarah ke esemes madadgaar nahin ho sakate
 "when i heard this, i understood that i got stuck in trouble till the throat
 jaisi ki ummid thi, pradhanmantri ne latadgaye ke liye mujhe bulaayaa
 When i reached his room's room, Nair, Narayanan and Pulak were seen coming out of there

 "the Prime Minister kept silence, i broke the silence," the party wants to give the credit for this decision to Rahul, but AAP and Raghuvansh Prasad are equally credited

 ‘‘sar, meraa kaam he aapaki acchhee chhavi pesh karnaa or aap jis rajnatik shrey ke hakdaar hai, use aapke liye surakshit rakhana meri jimmedaari he

 It is also necessary to state here that in UPA-1, Dr

 a few weeks after he became a minister, it became clear that Jairam's loyalty was only to Sonia, when she leaked a letter from Sonia to Dr

 Sonia in that letter called Drs

 bihar main rohtas or shekhpura jile aise he jahaan odief kaa kaam pragati par dikh rahaa he
 While the last is in Aurangabad district, where a child had to go outside for defecation in a school last week and died due to electric current
 aurangabad main sirf ek panchayat odief he
 There are a total of 19 blocks of administration in Rohtas in Kadairohtas district, of which 13 blocks have been declared ODF, 70 percent work has been done in the remaining 6 blocks
 bihar main rohtas jila odief main sabase aage he, to uske peeche yahaan ke prashasan kii kadai he

 By 2018, the goal of becoming open defecation free is the target of constructing 96 lakh 95 thousand toilets in Bihar, but this is far from the target

 # metoo has revealed the names of many famous people
 videsh rajyamantri emje akbar kaa naam saamne aane ke baad unhen buudhvaar ko apane pad se istipha dena padaa
 The matter first came to light regarding Tannushree Dattanana Patekar
 tanushri kaa aarope he ki naanaa patekar ne ek film kii shooting ke dauraan unke saath chhedhkhani kii
 Patekar, however, dismissed Tanushree's allegations and defamation claims against him
 yah alag baat he ki raaj thakare # metoo se judi mahilaon ke samarthan main aage aae hai lekin tanushri ne abhi haal main maanase pramukh raaj thakare ko aade haathon lete hue kaha tha ki manase ne haal main ek intervyuu main unhen hinsak hamale kii dhamkee di he
 Along with this, Maharashtra Police has filed a defamation case against Tanushree Dutta
 un par raaj thakare ke khilaaf aapattijanak tippanee karne kaa aarope he
 In Beed district of Maharashtra, the Cage Police has registered the case on the complaint of Sumant Das, the president of MNS district unit
 police kaa kahana he ki unhone section 500 ke tahat tanushri datta ke khilaaf manahani kaa cese registerd kiya he
 The matter is being investigated
 bataa den ki tanushri ne aarope lagaaya tha ki manase kaaryakartaaon ne naanaa patekar ke kehane par 2008 main unki car kii todphod kii thi
 They are also being threatened for the last ten years

 Apart from the investigation of PM Modi's rally speech, the Election Commission is also investigating the report on the issue of Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking for votes in the name of Balakot in the rally
 yahi nahin, ayog ne namo tivi ko lekar bhi kanoonee salaah lee he or anya kanoonee vikalpon par bhi vichaar kar rahaa he
 What Yogi Adityanath said? Tell me that Yogi Adityanath had said in the Meerut public meeting that if Congress, Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party have faith in Ali, then we have faith in Bajrangbali
 unhone kaha tha ki mayawati ne raily main kaha ki vah sirf muslim votaron kaa vot chaahati hai
 After this, he had said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak that the way Mayawati has asked for votes for Muslims, she has asked Muslims to vote only for the coalition and do not allow their votes to be divided
 ab hinduon ke paas bhartiya janata party ke alaava koi vikalp nahin bachaa he
 Mayawati made direct appeal to Muslims
 Earlier, BSP chief Mayawati made a direct appeal to the Muslims at Deoband rally
 unhone kaha tha ki muslim kisi bhi bahekaave main aakar apane vot ko na bantane den, balki balki basapa ummidavaar haji fajalurrhaan ke paksh main vot karen
 He repeatedly warned the Muslims of Saharanpur from the platform of the alliance that in any case, they should not allow their votes to be divided
 congress is laayak nahin he ki wo bijepi ko takkar de sake, jabaki mahagathbandhan ke paas majboot aadhaar he
 In such a situation, do not allow your votes to be scattered and unite to vote in favor of the coalition candidate
 chunaav ayog ne siem yogi or mayawati ko unki inhen bhaashanon ke kaaran notice thamaya he or 24 ghante main jawaab dene ko kaha he
 The Commission's move is speculating that the trouble of the two leading leaders may increase

 Chidambaram has said that unless you change the constitution, it cannot be possible

 However, this debate has still not been resolved
 akhbaar ko koi tippanee dene se inkaar karne vaali CIA ne agency ko bhi koi tippanee dene se inkaar kar diya
 The New York Times quoted two senior former US officials as saying that 20 CIA sources in China were either killed or incarcerated over a period of two years
 times ke mutabik, china ne pakade gaye america jasuson main se ek ko uske sahyogiyon ke saamne hi goli maari, taaki un logon ko chetavanee di ja sake jo america ke liye jasusi kar rahe hai
 Officials say this loss in China is comparable to a major incident in Soviet Russia during the Cold War
 reports ke mutabik, us samay CIA ke 2 jasuson ne america ko dhokhaa diya or rus ke liye mukhabari kii
 Because of this, many CIA spies working in the Soviet were killed
 bataa den ki china or rus main khufia network kaayam karnaa ek badi chunauti mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, after losing their spies, the CIA would have to work very hard afresh

 'vaise yah pehali film nahin he jise karina ne karne se manaa kiya ho, karina 'queen', 'chennai express', 'goliyon kii raasalila: ramlila', or'dil dhadkane do'jaisi filmon ko karne se manaa kar diya tha
 All these films proved to be big hits
 apana dil lahore main chhodkar kareeb 20 saal pehle landan ja bases moni mohsin or mumbai kii rahane vaali shobhaa de ne apni shikayaton ko saajha kiya
 He said that India and Pakistan have not only divided the entire subcontinent among their countries, but have also shared collective dreams
 jaise hi unka yah shikayati samvaad khatm hua, mohsin ne taj pales hotel main us subah heredressor se apni mulaakaat kii baaten bataayin
 Mohsin told the hairdresser, "dry my hair and straighten it
 xxrep 4 ' mohatarama, kidar se baantun? baayen yaa daaen?'' heredressor ne moni ke baalo ko do taraf karne ke bare main poocha
 On this, the Punjabi-dominated audience of Delhi echoed with laughter
 sachaai bhi yahi he ki seemaa ke donon taraf ke punjabi moni or de kii baton main funs gaye, jinhone bataaya ki redcliff line ke donon taraf ek hi tarah ke moni jajbaat hai
 Of course, there is a big difference between these two authors
 moni apni kitabon or akhabaaron ke stambhon main pathakon ke saath, apane sanakee punjabi paatr janu ke jariye hansi-thitholi karti hai, jabaki shobhaa de apane samvedansheel sawaalon se pathakon ko jhakzor detii hai
 The Delhi people ask the first question, Dey says, "in which colony do you live (like Punjabis copying the pronunciation of the colony)?" "and then says that instead a Mumbaikar sees how thick his bank balance is
 manch par kuch dur baithi moni majaak main kahati hai, ''aapako kahana chahie, jorge kluni?''de kaa lahore ke maahaul kaa vriîttant us satr main chaaya rahaa
 But the truth is that the Shiraja of the society that Moni and Dey describe is now falling apart
 khushnuma lahore or dilli@mumbai kaa maahaul ab badalata ja rahaa he
 In Pakistan, such religious bigotry has come to dominate, on which Moni has no other option but to express regret
 jahaan tak de kaa sawaal he, unhen bhi ehsaas he ki unka jamaana purana padataa ja rahaa he
 During the Modi era, the sensex has become more interesting than sex
 janu, ye ham kis duniya main pahunchate ja rahe hai!priy shobhaa,halo ji! pichhali baar jab ham mili the, tab se maine tumko bataane ke liye kitna kuch sanjokar rakhaa he
 i would have come to see you before, this would not be Stupid's nonsense of visa-sheeja
 yakeenan, ye bhi kya musiibat he, yaar? aap saikadon khushaamaden kiye bagaiyr seemaa bhi paar nahin kar sakate
 Begging for visas from Europeans seems very bad, but it is not good to cheer up the countrymen
 kam-se-kam ham khate-pite jaison ke liye to nahin hi
 Like the poor, who beg every day for everything
 ham aadi nahin hai na in sabake
 Talking about visas, we have heard that our foreign secretary is also quietly conducting backyard talks
 do saal kii kutti ke baad sulla (sulah) karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Janu says that their conversation is stuck
 vaise wo to hona hi tha
 What i mean is that if you keep raising the bastards of Kashmir and Siachen (siachen) and Sir Creep (by the way, this is Sir Creep (creek), what is it?), Then naturally Baba, you cannot move forward Can
 agar islu (islamabad) or south block ke baabuon ke badale hamaari governments (sarkarein) tumko or mujhe baatcheet karne ko bhejtin, sab kuch palak jhapakate hal ho jaataa kyonki tum jaanati ho, tum or main, ki kitna kuch hamaare bich kaaman (saajha) he?hamaare bich cricket, hamaare seleb dost, bollywood, sab ek jaisaa he
 Paan, Mango, Weddings, Shallu, Sholay are all shared
 or phir hamaare sabhi khan saajha hai
 Brother Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Irrfan Khan, Fawad Khan, Imran Khan, Rehman Khan and of course the most famous, how can we forget our Khan Market
 shobhaa jaanati ho, mere liye pehle harods he, phir dubai mal-jahaan shork kaa emporium he-or phir mere liye khan market myne rakhata he
 Simply, if an aquarium opens in the mine market, it will become second to me
 philhal to mujhe maaf karnaa
 Yes, remember, TV drama is also similar between us
 mummy to aapke vaale ek serial chakori yaa aisa hi kuch naam he, us par ekadam lattu hai
 Whenever i call, she says that i am in the bathroom
 magar main jaanati hum ki ve chakori dekh rahi hai
 Apart from this, he always has diarrhea
 vaise, jaraa socho, koi apni beti se baat karne kii jagah bhala drama dekhtaa he! apni makvami ke bare main aisi baat nahin kerani chahie magar mummy bhi aisi dhokheybaaj hai na
 But Shobha, let me tell about myself, i myself have become obsessed with the Turkish serials, which are seen in our Pakistan these days
 main bataaun, vahaan ke mard kaise lambey, tagade or khubasurat hai
 My favorite serial is Mera Sultan, which is about Sultan Suleman Awwal
 main usase itnaa jud gai hum ki uske bare main kya-kya bataaun
 After it was over i told my aunt Pusi, "aye aunt, i am so depressed (sad), you will not ask me?" He said, "but why son?" "I said," Because my Turkish soap (turkish serial) came to an end
 '' unhone kaha, ''jaanati ho betaa, main to dav hi leti hum
 This keeps the skin soft
 ''haa, shobhaa, yaad aayaa, hamaare bich ek or cheez ek jaisi haih bandishen! so, hamaare liye vasant par bandish he
 Gavments (governments) say that it is for our good because many boys fall from the roofs flying kites
 magar mere dimag main kya chal rahaa he ki agar gavement ko hamaari hifaazat kii itani hi phikr he to kalashnikkras (clashinkove riflein or pistaul) par bandish kyon nahin laga detii, haa? wo to aap bazaar main chapatiyon kii tarah aasaani se kharid sakate hai
 And yes, we also have a ban on youtube
 aakhir utyub par aap kuch aisa dekh-sun sakate hai, jisase hamaare jaise maasoom, deendaar logon ko jor kaa jhatka lag saktaa he yaa galati se dekh len to sidhe dojakh main chale jaaen
 i guess there is a ban on beef for the bawkbees due to any such reason
 are suno, bombai kahuun yaa us par bhi bandish he? kisi ke jajbaat ko thes nahin pahunchaana chaahati na, iklaute intry vija par mehmaan jo hum, or vah bhi badi khushaamad ke baad mila he
 
 
 
 phir maine suna he ki bibisi kii documentary par bhi tum logon ke liye bandish he? kya pataa use dekhakar tumhen jhatka lag jaae
 It is, of course, not the answer to the movements that keep our moral welfare so much in every moment, isn't it, Shobha, why do these foreigners do such shows or do such things, which make us feel so Shake? And so discredit us all over the world? i mean why can't they just say nice things about us? Between you, me and this boundary, there is a conspiracy to let us down from my bed
 yah to bas ek kehane kii baat he
 Otherwise, we are a people of advanced ancient civilization, no? i mean, cities like Harappa and Moenjodaro of old times, brother was not its Indus Valley Civilization? In them, they discovered drains made of brick and drains etc
 jaraa socho! chaar hajaar saal pehle, jab landan or neuyork vaale bhaaluu ke chamade se deh dhankate the or keede-makode khate the, ham curavit ke kralash vaale toilets main baitha karte the
 Yes! And last week someone from a branch of United Nations came and started telling us that 40 million Pakistanis do bathroom outside and it is not good
 main usase kahana chaahati thi ki bhai, maaf karnaa, garib log toilets main baithna bhul gaye or baahar bathroom kar rahe hai to yah koi hamaari galati thode hi he ki unki yaaddaasht chali gai he?or bas, shobhaa, aakhir main apane kaam par laut jaaya jaae, partiyaan, khaanaa, jities, o baba, get tugedar (meljol), shaadiyaan vagairah
 Everyone who calls, does not go or feels bad, neither
 to, shobhaa hamaare jaise mehnat karne waalon ko fursat kahaan

 In the seventh phase, elections are to be held in 40 seats on 8 March
 purvanchal ko upi kii satta kaa getwe kaha jaataa he
 About 40 per cent of the seats in the UP assembly are from this region
 bijepi ne purvanchal main prachaar abhiyaan main puri takat jhonk rakhi he
 PM Modi himself has been in Varanasi for the last two days for campaigning
 purvanchal ke alag-alag hisson main ek darjan se zyada mantri campan sanbhale hue hai
 There are 5 aspects of bjp's strategy regarding Purvanchal that can turn up in UP elections: 1
 modi effect2014 ke aam chunaav main jab bijepi ne narendra modi ko piem candidet banaaya to gujarati kii chhavi se baahar laane kii ranneeti ke tahat upi se chunaav ladaaya gaya or iske liye varanasi kii seat ko chunaa gaya
 One strategy behind this decision was also to increase the bjp's dominance in the seats of the East
 puure upi main modi kaa jaadu chalaa or 80 main se loksabhaa kii 73 siten bijepi ne apane khate main kar leen
 Now preparations are on to repeat the same magic in the assembly elections
 purvanchal se 170 siten aati hai or iske liye team modi ne khud campan sambhaal rakhaa he
 2
 sampradayik cardeupi chunaav ko shuruyaat se vikaas ke mudde par ladane kaa daawa karti aa rahi bijepi achaanak purvanchal aate-aate sampradayik card par kyon utar ai iske bhi paryaapt kaaran hai
 PM Modi himself turned arrows of political statements in a different direction from the idioms of cremation, graveyard, Ramadan and Diwali
 iske baad sakshi maharaj saamne aae or kah daalaa ki kabristaan se jagah kii barbaadi hoti he
 Akhilesh bets on the bjp's policy of politics and tried to divert the direction of the debate by using the idiom of the donkeys of Gujarat

 3
 modi cabinet kaa purvanchal mishanpiem modi hi nahin cabinet ke 12 mantri purvanchal main party kaa prachaar abhiyaan sanbhale hue hai
 The work of implementing this strategy started last year only when PM Modi started the Ujjwala mission from Ballia
 iske baad gorakhpur main khaad kaarkaana or ames dekar ilaake main apni pakad banane kii disha main team modi ne kadam aage badhaayaa
 Banaras was included in the list of Smart Cities
 piem modi apni reliyon main aksar kehete hai ki is ilaake kii tasviir badalane kaa jimmaa unhone uthaaya he
 Now Team Modi is going from village to village and informing people about the central schemes
 is ranniti ke tahat sangh ko bhi jameen par utaara gaya he taaki purvanchal main basapa kii paith khatm kar upi main camel khilaayaa ja sake

 Apparently the pm's reference was on the BSP trying to win Purvanchal on the strength of the musclemen
 bispi ne mukhtaar ansaari ko party main laakar gajipur, mau or gorakhpur main jeet kii ranneeti banaai he
 This Kattapa war of PM Modi will give the message of ending the Bahubali's empire among the people and for this BJP is trying to make inroads among the people
 5
 Bhojpuri Star Attraction: Bhojpuri Star Attraction is also an important part of bjp's strategy in East Zone
 upi chunaav se thik pehle bhojpuri abhinayta or gayak manoj tiwari ko dilli bijepi kii kaman saunpi gai or purvanchal main prachaar ke liye utaar diya gaya
 The political chariot had just increased towards Purvanchal that the second Bhojpuri star Ravikishan had entered the BJP and it became clear that the BJP is preparing to take full advantage of these local language stars in the elections

 In order to make the state prosperous, mini trucks of this scheme have not reached the districts either and have arrived and are waiting for government approval
 udhar congress ne chunaav ayog main shikaayat kar is abhiyaan par pabandi lagane kii maang kar di he
 Samruddhi Bhopal started in Bhopal on Sunday, where all the big leaders including Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan flagged off about fifty mini trucks
 makasad janata se samruddhi kaa idia lenaa tha
 BJP is excited about the plan but at the same time it is saddened by the Congress complaint

 a large number of suggestions have also been found on whatsapp

 But sadly, Congress has made such a complaint, violating the code of conduct
 kailash vijayawargeey ne jis shikaayat kaa zikr kiya, usamen congress ne kaha he ki sarkaar ne aachaar samhita lagane ke purv 27 se 5 oktober tak lagaataar vigyaapan jari kiye hai
 This advertisement has been released under the title "idea Main Ho Dum To Poor Karenge Hum" of Future MP Task Force
 sarkaar ke or bijepi ke vigyaapan main sirf phone number kaa fark he
 Congress feels that all this is misuse of government money

 In this campaign released in the name of Mera Sarkar, my government is showing an exercise to remove public anger and a strategy to connect BJP with the people
 dekhnaa he ki chunaav main yah kitna phayda bijepi ko pahunchaati he
 Congress spokesperson Shobha Ojha said that the BJP was using government programs in its name
 janata ko kya mila 
 
 
 Nothing is embarrassing, what worked in 15 years
 meri sarkaar meraa suzav ke naam se jari is abhiyaan main janata kii naaraazgi dur karne kii kavayad or bijepi ko janata se jodne kii ranneeti dikh rahi he

 NCP kaa daawa-hamaare paas 170 vidhayakon kaa samarthanabhjhf ke paas 105 vidhayak, bahumat ke liye chahie 145supreme court main aaj hogi maharashtra cese kii sunwaayeemaharashtra kii raajnneeti karnataka ke naatak se bhi bada hota dikh rahaa he
 About 16 days after refusing to form the government, Devendra Fadnavis suddenly took the oath of chief minister for the second time on Saturday morning
 fadanvis kaa shapath lenaa tha ki ek saath sarkaar banane kii koshish kar rahi shivasena, congress or ensipi harakat main ain or apane-apane vidhayakon ko sanjone main lag gai
 The biggest break was to fall on the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), but party chief Sharad Pawar called an important meeting of his mlas in a hurry and 42 of his 54 mlas attended the meeting
 baithak medjit pavarko hataakar party ke vidhayak dal ke nae netaa banaae gaye jayant patil ne kaha ki aaj kii baithak main 42 vidhayak shaamil hue jabaki 7 sampark main hai, ravivaar ko hone vaali ek or baithak main 49 vidhayak shaamil honge
 Sharad Pawar saved the party? If the NCP claims to be true, then the crisis of major breakdown in the party is over, in such a situation, the big headache of NCP has gone away and this headache has come on BJP
 bijepi ke paas 288 sadasyeey vidhansabha main 105 vidhayak hi hai
 The government needs the support of at least 145 mlas to prove its majority and that is 40 steps away from this magic point
 agar ensipi ke daavon par vishwaas kiya jaae to 54 main se 49 vidhayak uske saath hai to sirf 5 vidhayakon ke dam par bijepi kaise floor test par paas hogi
 As soon as the government was formed, the Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP started trying to save their legislators
 congress ne to apane vidhayakon ko jaipur bhej diya jabaki pehle uski yojana bhopal bhejne kii thi
 Shiv Sena is also keeping an eye on its mlas
 ye he siton kaa ganit?pichley maheene hue vidhansabha chunaav membijepico jahaan 105 siten mili thi to shivasena ko 56, congress ko 44 or ensipi ko 54 siten mili thim
 Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress were working together to form the government
 ensipi pramukh sharad pavaarane daawa kiya ki is gathbandhan ke paas 156 se zyada vidhayak hai or nirdaleey vidhayakon kaa samarthan bhi hasil he
 In this way we have the support of about 170 mlas
 shapath grahan ke baad devendra fadanvis or ajit pavaar (ani)shanivaar kii subah jis teji se raajnneetik ghatnakram main badlaav aayaa usne ab tak agar-magar kar rahe teenon dalon shivasena, ensipi or congress ko ekajute to kar hi diya he
 The three parties together pleaded in the Supreme Court to conduct a floor test on Sunday itself
 saath hi maharashtra ke rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari ke us aadesh ko radd karne kii maang kii gai jisamen unhone soobe mensarkaar banane ke liye devendra fadanvis ko aamantritkiya tha
 Maharashtra case will be heard in Supreme Court at 11:30 am on Sunday
 bijepi kii agali chaal par najnagar sabaki najar desh kii sabase badi adaalat kii ore lagi he ki vahaan se kis tarah kaa faisla aata he
 If the court asks for a floor test at the earliest then it will be extremely difficult for the BJP to collect this magic figure
 pichley saal karnataka main floor test main kirakiri kaa saamana karne ke baad bijepi chaahegi ki phir is tarah kii apriy sthiti kaa saamana na karnaa pade
 Although no one knows what will be the bjp's next move, but the politics of Maharashtra is becoming more interesting than the politics of Karnataka
 sabaki najar ab bijepi kii us agali chaal par he jo usko satta main banaae rakhe
