 The special thing is that like Murali, there is no tag of 'chakar' on Herath
 murali bhale hi spin ke 'jaadugar' rahe lekin australia main unki gendon ko chaking ke aarope ke kaaran no ball ghoshit kiye jane, boometric test se guzarane or bishan singh bedi jaise diggaj spinner ke 'jaevlin throre' ke sambodhan ke kaaran unke khel kaushal kii chamak malin jarur padi
 Luckily for Herath, the action is absolutely clean
 is 38 varshiya srilankai gendbaaj kaa ausat or strike rate kamaal kaa he
 Herath has made 27 of 75 Test matches so far
 97 ke ausat se 351 wicket (iconomi rate 2
 76)
 unka strike rate 60
 He has managed to take wickets in almost every 61 balls
 unke in aankadon kii agar murali se tulana karen to murali kaa test kariyar strike rate 55
 0, economy rate 2
 47 or ausat 22
 Is 72
 murali ne 133 test main 800 wicket hasil kiye the
 The comments baayen haath ke leg spinner herath ko lagaataar kasi hui gendbaaji or lambey spel phenkane ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Herath, who made his Test career debut in 1999, met the legendary Murali in his first match
 yahi nahin, australia ke khilaaf gaale main hue is test main unhone murali ke saath hi australian pari ko sametane main bhoomika nibhaai thi
 In this draw, Murali took five for 71 and Herath took four wickets for 97 runs
 herath ke bare main yah jarur kaha ja saktaa he ki unhone apane adhiktar wicket gharelu-madadgaar pichon par hi hasil kiye hai
 At home ground where he scored 23 in 41 tests
 14 ke ausat se 231 wicket liye hai vahiin videsh main khele gaye 34 test main 120 wicket liye hai, isamen neutral vaineu par hasil kiye gaye 24 wicket bhi shaamil hai
 He averages around 37 in foreign plains
 herath jald hi srilanka ke duusare sabase kaamyaab gendbaaj ban jaaenge
 He is just four wickets behind from paceman Chaminda Vaas's record of 355 Test wickets
 is baat ko dhyaan rakhana hoga ki vaas ne 111 test main ye wicket hasil kiye the jabaki herath mahaj 75 test main hi unke record se mahaj chaar wicket kii duuri par hai
 If 38-year-old Herath continues his performance, the figure of his wickets can cross 400
 
 The average and strike rate of this 38-year-old Sri Lankan bowler is amazing
 herath ne ab tak 75 test maichon main 27
 351 wickets at an average of 97 (economy rate 2
 76 )hasil kiye hai
 His strike rate is 60
 7 kaa he yani lagbhag har 61 gend main ve wicket lene main kaamyaab rahe hai
 If we compare these figures with Murali, Murali's test career strike rate is 55
 0, iconomi rate 2
 47 and average 22
 72 kaa he
 Murali had taken 800 wickets in 133 Tests
 tippaniyan Herath, a left-arm leg-spinner, is known for consistently bowling and throwing long spells
 1999 main apane test kariyar kaa aagaaj karne vaale herath ko apane pehle hi match main mahaan murali ke saath mila
 Not only this, he played a role in the Australian innings with Murali in this test against Australia in Galle
 drow rahe is match main murali ne 71 ran dekar paanch or herath ne 97 ran dekar chaar wicket liye the
 It can be said about Herath that he has taken most of his wickets on home-friendly pitches
 gharelu maidan main jahaan unhone 41 test main 23
 He has taken 231 wickets at an average of 14 while in the 34 Tests played abroad, he has taken 120 wickets, including 24 wickets taken at the neutral venue
 videshi maidaanon main unka ausat 37 ke aasapaas kaa he
 Herath will soon become Sri Lanka's second most successful bowler
 tej gendbaaj chaminda vaas ke 355 test wicket ke record se ve mahaj chaar wicket hi peeche hai
 It has to be kept in mind that Vaas had taken these wickets in 111 Tests while Herath is just four wickets away from his record in only 75 Tests
 38 saal ke herath ne yadi aisa hi pradarshan jari rakhaa to apane viketon kaa aankada 400 ke paar pahunchaa sakate hai

 fifa vishwacap main ab tak sabase kaamyaab rahe brazil kii daavedaari hi sabase badi maani ja rahi he to uski kai vajahen hai - jinamein se ek yah bhi he ki brazil mezbaan he or use gharelu maidan or samarthakon kaa phayda milegaa, lekin footbal kii duniya main italy kii daavedaari bhi kabhi kam nahin aanki jaati
 In addition to four World Cup titles, Italy also has the distinction of winning a European Championship and an Olympic title
 lekin italy ke phans apni team ko lekar badi daavedaari isliye pesh nahin kar rahe hai, kyonki varsh 2006 main khitaab jeetne ke baad yah team varsh 2010 main pehle hi round main baahar ho gai thi
 In the group stage last time Italy played a draw against Paraguay and New Zealand and then Slovakia beat Italy 3–2 and did not allow it to reach the round of sixteen
 is baar bhi italy (9) ko group-di main urugve (7) costarika (28) or england (10) kaa saamana karnaa he
 It is also being considered as the Group of Death and crossing the first hurdle for Italy can also prove to be a considerable challenge
 iske baavjood sirf aath saal pehle worldcup trophy ko apane naam karne kaa gaurav hasil karne vaali yah team ek baar phir khitaab ke liye daavedaari pesh kar rahi he to use duusari timen behad gambhirtha se le rahi hai
 Even though Italy could not progress past the first round in 2010, its fans are confident that this time goalkeeper captain Gianluigi Buffon will change the face of the team with his feats
 varsh 2006 main midfilder andria parlo ke saath worldcup vijeta team kaa hissaa rahe 37 saal ke captain baphon jaanate hai ki ek or khitaab unki team ko brazil jaisi kaamyaab team kii barabari karvaa saktaa he
 Fans of the team that lifted the trophy in the years 1934, 1938, 1982 and last in 2006 are expecting a fifth title from him
 Azurri kaa mantra japate hue iske phans duniya ke kisi bhi stadium main 12wein khilaadi kaa role adaa karte nazar aate hai
 This team traveled to the finals six times, once in third and once in fourth place
 badi baat yah he ki brazil ke baad duniya kii duusari sabase kaamyaab team ne is baar qualifing or abhyaas maichon main apana dam dikhaaya he
 The Italian team appears adorned with supermodels on the field, and is viciously outplaying the opposition in a vicious manner
 italy ke sitare Playing from a 4-3-3 formation, the team has high hopes from striker Balotelli along with midfielder Di Rossi
 captain baphon or midfilder parlo ko varsh 2006 main trophy uthaane kii ahmiyat maaloom he or puri team dhire-dhire lay main aa rahi he
 Italy's specialty aamtaur par rakshaatmak tareeke se khelti italy ke kile ko bhed paanaa kisi bhi team ke liye behad mushkil sabit hota he
 Apart from this, Italian goalkeepers have always proved to be Italy's strength
 italy kii chunauti Italy's biggest challenge is the pain of being eliminated in the first round in the last World Cup
 italy ko is baar shuruyaat main hi apni ranneeti badalani pad sakati he
 Being in the group of death, Italy will need to be alert from the beginning
 in sabake baavjood 56 saal ke coach seisure prandeli apni team ko pehle hi match main england ke khilaaf jor lagane ke liye prerit kar rahe hai

 bahut log prayaas bhi karte honge or bahuton ko mil bhi jaataa hoga
 On January 3, 2016, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari had said, "headaches have started due to the awards, people fall behind, Padmashri wants recommendations in the Padmabhushan award
 film abhinetri aashaa paarekh padmabhushan paane kii ummid main mere ghar kii lift kharaab hone ke baavjood 12 manzilen chadhakar pahunchi thim
 It was very bad
 unhone kaha tha ki mujhe padmashri mila he, lekin filmon main meraa yogadan dekhte hue mujhe padmabhushan milanaa chahie
 ' ho saktaa he ki mantri ji ne baat sahi hi kahi ho magar ise saarvajanik na karte to acha hi rahata
 Due to this statement, people should not doubt many of the 112 names, who must have climbed the ladder or who has climbed the ladder and became a minister
 puraskaron kii suchi main kuch pramukh naam hai - Dhirubhai Ambani, who is being posthumously awarded the Padmavibhushan
 ramoji raav ko sahitya or media ke liye padmavibhushan puraskaar diya gaya he
 Former DRDO Chief and Scientist Doctor V

 Vishwanath Shanta, former Governor and Union Minister Jagmohan
 is suchi main film abhinayta rajnikant kaa naam bhi shaamil he
 Surely the Latifa industry must have got involved in creating something about the speed of the award and Rajinikanth
 pichley saal jab padam puraskaron ke liye shri shri ravishankar or ramdev ke naam kii charchaa hone lagi thi tab ramdev ne rajnath singh ko patr likhakar kaha ki main sanyasi hum or apane sanyas dharm ke saath raashtra dharm evam seva dharm ko nishkaam or anasakt bhav se karnaa apana kartavya samajhataa hum
 The ascetic should remain equal in both contempt and hospitality
 main nivedan karnaa chahta hum ki gauravpurn kaary karne vaale kisi anya mahanubhav ko pradaan kar mujhe anugrihit karenge
 i believe so
 swami ramdev kaa naam is baar kii suchi main nahin he lekin shri shri ravishankar kaa naam he
 For Padmavibhushan
 pichley saal unhone bhi 24 janvari 2015 ke rose twit kiya tha ki rajnath singh ji ne mujhe phone kar padam puraskaar ke bare main bataaya
 i thank the government for considering my name
 main chahta hum ki sarkaar meri jagah kisi or ko sammanit kare
 Congratulations to Sri Sri Ravi Shankar
 
 
 unhen aadhyatm ke liye padmavibhushan diya gaya he
 It is not that everyone wants to
 kai log hai jo nahin bhi chaahate hai
 Many people refuse to meet
 kai logon ko lenaa bhi padaa jaataa he ki sarkaar ko manaa karen yaa desh ko
 Let's take it
 padmabhushan puraskaar paane waalon main shaamil hai anupam kher, udit narayan jha, purv sieji vinod raay, vaai lakshmi prasad, ajit akhbaar ke sampadak or purv rajya sabha sadsy barjinder singh hamdard, di nageshwar reddy, hafeez contractor, paalanji shahpurji mistre, indu jain, aar

 Ajay Devgan also campaigned for BJP in Bihar elections
 ajay devgan ko dekhne ke liye bihar main kaaphi bheed jute rahi thi
 In 2012, when Narendra Modi first had a Google Hangout, it was operated by Ajay Devgan
 udit narayan ne bhi chunaavon ke dauraan ek gaanaa gaaya tha jiske bol the 2014 main modi aane vaala he
 Well Udit is a great singer
 agar kisi ko modi aane vaala se etraz he to wo dilavaale dulhaniya kaa gaanaa sun saktaa he jo udit ne hi gaaye the, basharte use shahrukh se etraz na ho to
 Udit Narayan Jha deserves these awards on the basis of his experience, apart from political reasons
 anupam kher or madhur bhandarkar ne sahishnutaa-ashishnutaa kii bahes ke dauraan sakriy rup se sarkaar kaa bachaav kiya tha or aword vaapasi kaa virodh karte karte aword bhi paa gaye
 But can anyone question Anupam Kher's experience and acting arts
 2004 main vaajapeyi sarkaar ke dauraan anupam kher ko padmashri mila tha
 It took so many years to reach Padmabhushan
 kya iske peeche raajnneetik kaaran nahin ho sakate hai
 Therefore, there are political reasons for both meeting and not meeting
 anupam kher padmabhushan puraskaron kii paatrata rakhte hai or zarurat padane par in puraskaron ko paane waalon kii paatrata par bhi sawaal kar dete hai
 Twitter shows that he raised his voice to restore recognition of the award in the year of 2010 and tweeted that the awards in our country have become a mockery of the system
 kisi bhi puraskaar main koi pramanikta nahin bachi he
 Be it the Film Awards or the Padma Awards now
 2010 main rekha, aamir khan, saif ali khan, e aar rahamaan, zohara sahagal, pandit channulaal mishra jo aage chalakar 2014 main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke loksabhaa chunaav ke samay prastaavak bane, illaiya raja ko padam sammaan mili the
 It is expected that Anupam Kher's complaint about the Padma Awards will be over
 padmabhushan milane par anupam kher ko jivan kaa saransh bhi mil gaya
 His statement is, 'I am very happy, years of hard work paid off, slept on the platform, did 400 films, was appreciated now
 desh ne sammaan diya
 ' unhone kaha ki ek clerk ke bete ko padam puraskaar mil rahaa he
 By the way, in this country, the son of the tea seller has become the Prime Minister and the newspaper seller has reached the presidency
 kamaal kaa mulk he
 Amazing people
 puraskaar us viraat kaa prasad he jise ham mulk kehete hai
 Anyone gets emotional
 isliye anupam kher ko badhai, balki sabhi ko badhai
 Many names in this list are also interesting and their records are fantastic
 twitor se pataa chalata he ki unhone 2010 ke saal main is puraskaar kii manyata behaal karne ke liye awaz buland kii thi or twit kiya tha ki hamaare desh main puraskaar system kaa mazaaq ban kar rah gaye hai
 There is no authenticity left in any of the awards
 chaahe wo film puraskaar hon yaa ab padam puraskaar hi
 In 2010, Rekha, Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan, AR Rahman, Zohra Sehgal, Pandit Chhannulal Mishra, who later became a proponent during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Illaiah Raja received Padma awards
 ummid he padam puraskaron ko lekar anupam kher kii shikaayat samaapt ho gai hogi
 Upon receiving the Padma Bhushan, Anupam Kher also got a summary of his life
 unka bayaan he, 'bahut khush hum, saalon kii mehnat rang laai, placeform par soya, 400 filmein kin, saraahaa gaya he ab
 The country paid respects
 ' He said that a clerk's son is getting the Padma Award
 vaise is desh main chaay vaale ke bete pradhanmantri ban chuke hai or akhbaar bechney vaala raashtrapati pad tak pahunchaa he
 This is a wonderful country
 kamaal ke log hai
 The award is a prasad of the great we call the country
 koi bhi bhavuk ho jaataa he
 So congratulations to Anupam Kher, but to everyone
 is suchi main bhi kai naam dilachasp hai or unke record shandaar hai
 On Thursday, the Minister of State for External Affairs General VK Singh said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak on the terror attack in Pulwama that the right answer to this act of terrorists will be given at the right time
 ek or sargical strike ke sawaal par general wike singh kaa kahana ki desh makul vakt par sahi karrwai ko anjaam degaa
 According to the former army chief, what should be the response to the attack, will also be analyzed
 saath hi unhone kaha ki yah vakt ek-duusare par ungali uthaane kaa nahin he
 It is time to join hands and gather the country so that we can counter terrorism
 antarrashtriya str par pakistan ko alag-thalag karne ke sawaal par general wike singh kaa kahana he ki bharat kii spasht niti he, jab tak seemaa par golibari chalati rahegi or pakistan aatankwaad kaa saath detaa rahegaa, ham baatcheet karne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 According to VK Singh, there was an attack inside Mumbai, did Pakistan issue a statement on it? Then why are we hoping that he will speak on the Pulwama terror attack
 chor to chor he or vah kabhi nahin bolegaa ki main chor hum
 It is up to you what you want to do
 isliye maine uchit karrwai kii baat kahi
 On the question of the input from the IED to the terrorists on the way to the deployment of the security forces and their movement before the attack, VK Singh says that the inputs keep coming
 input main yah baat saaf nahin hoti ki hamalaa kaise kiya jayega, hamalavar cas aayega yaa kis gaadi main aayega
 According to the input, action is taken accordingly
 videsh rajyamantri ne bataaya ki har aatankwaadi sanghathan koshish karata he ki aatanki harakat ko anjaam diya jaae or har surakshabal kii koshish hoti he use naakaam kar aatanki ko khatm kar diya jaae
 Here the analysis of how the terrorists succeeded, will be analyzed at the ground level in a different way
 kartarpur coridorake maamle par general wike singh kaa kahana he ki guru nanak dev ji kaa 550waan prakaash parv chal rahaa he
 It would be better to keep this matter separate from the rest
 sansad main sabhi partiyon ke aakraamak ruukh ke badatim anna ke sadsy arvind kejarivalane somvaar ko kaha ki hamalogon ne koi maryaada nahin todi he
 In an exclusive conversation with Aaj Tak correspondent Ashok Singhal, Arvind Kejriwal said that if the Parliament wants to increase its respect, then discuss the murder of Narendra Kumar, the mps who are accused of criminal or any kind of action
 ajtak samvaadadaata ne jab kejariwal se poocha ki aapke paas saansadon ke khilaaf kya saboot he, iske jawaab main unhone kaha ki kaig kii filon main saare saboot hai, ajtak kii website par saboot hai, aapaki website (ajtak kii websitettp: / / aajtak
 in) We have picked up the evidence
 arvind kejariwal ne film paan singh tomars ke ek doylog kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki jab film main yah kaha jaataa ki sansad main to daaku baithte hai or taaliyaan bajati hai, iskaa kya matlab he? unhone kaha ki netaaon ko eemaandaaree se sochna chahie ki janata unalogon ke bare main aisa kyon sochati he
 In response to a question asked on the proposal to be brought in the Parliament, Kejriwal said that if we are guilty then we are ready to face any punishment
 unhone aage kaha ki agar hamaare sajaa bhugatne se bharat kii aam janata ko thodi bhi raahat milti he to hamen sajaa bhugat kar khushi milegi
 Earlier in the Lok Sabha on Monday morning, JDU leader Sharad Yadav attacked Team Anna and said that we have also done agitations
 hamane bhi garibon or mazdooron kii ladaai ladi he
 He said that we never used such language
 unhone kaha ki team anna apane andolan se bhatak gai he
 Team Anna has insulted the entire parliament
 ye sara maamla ravivaar ko jantar mantar par jad(you) netaa sharad yadav par kii gai tippanee ko lekar he
 During Anna's fast, a video was shown from the stage showing Sharad Yadav commenting on the Lokpal
 iske baad team anna ke sadsy manish sitaudiya ne kaha, 'chor kii dadhi main
 
 ' is par vahaan maujuud hajaaron logon ne baaki vaakya puraa kar diya
 Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti made a tweet about former External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj
 unhone (mehbooba Mufti) likhaa ki sushamaa ji ( Sushma Swaraj) ne har ghatana par apni twarit pratikriya dekar hameshaa hi apane mantralay ke madhyam se maanavtaa ko badhaava diya
 Their lack will always be felt
 bataa den ki sushamaa swaraj ( Sushma Swaraj) ne is baar loksabhaa chunaav nahin ladaa tha or unhone pehle hi nijee kaarnon kii vajah se videsh mantralay ko bhi chhodane kaa faisla kiya tha
 After a resounding victory in the Lok Sabha elections, this time PM Modi replaced Sushma Swaraj
 jaishankar ko videsh mantri banaaya he
 s
 jaishankar pehle videsh sachiv the
 Sushma ji gave a human touch to her ministry with her prompt responses & kindness
 She will be missed
 https: / / t
 co / le22zdob6ugorawalaba he ki mahabuuba mufti (mehbooba Mufti) ne isse pehle piem modi ko lekar kai twit kiye the
 Mehbooba Mufti took a dig at PM Modi's visit to Kedarnath
 unhone(mehbooba Mufti)piem modi (PM Modi) kii is yatra kii ek photo ko twit kiya tha
 Mehbooba Mufti wrote that me and NNI often do these things in loneliness
 bataa den ki kedarnath dham pahunche pradhanmantri modi kai kaaryakramon main shaamil hone ke baad gufa main pahunche or vahaan dhyaan lagaaya
 Earlier, PM attended Aarti
 chaar-paanch ghante tak unhone puure ilaake kaa nirikshan kiya
 During this time it was also raining here
 piem modi chauthi baar kedarnath dham darshan karne pahunche the
 After reaching Jolly Grant Airport in Dehradun, Modi reached Kedarnath by helicopter
 ve pahari topi ke saath grey rang kaa suut or qamar par bhagava rang kaa gamchaa pahane hue the
 After landing by helicopter, Modi went straight to the temple, where he had special worship to Lord Shiva
 is dauraan anya shraddhaluon ko mandir main pravesh kii anumati nahin thi
 The temple opens for devotees at four in the morning
 vahiin, isse pehlemhabooba mufti (mehbooba Mufti)jammu-kashmir se vishesh darja waapas lene ko lekar bada bayaan diya tha
 He (mehbooba Mufti) said that if this happens then we will have to rethink whether we have to live with India or not
 mahabuuba mufti ne (mehbooba Mufti) vitt mantri arun jetali par palatwaar karte hue kaha tha ki samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 ko yadi khatm kiya gaya to bharat sangh or rajya ke bich sambandh samaapt ho jayega
 Mehbooba Mufti told party workers at his residence that Arun Jaitley should understand this
 yah kahana aasaan nahin he
 If you finish (article) 370, then your relations with Jammu and Kashmir will end

 Also asked about Dawood's passport and various locations in Pakistan that came in the limelight
 bharat sarkaar is maamle ko lekar pakistan se lagaataar baat kar rahi he
 India's intelligence agencies are also trying to fulfill their international obligations in the context of the Red Corner Notice issued by UN Security Council against Ibrahim
 sarkaar is maamle par nirtanr pakistan ke saath baat karti rahi he
 Significantly, even before this, India had given strong information about Dawood Ibrahim to Pakistan
 uske kai pate bhi pakistan ke saath saajha kiye the
 Pakistan has been told many times in this regard
 mafia chota rajan kii giraftaar ke baad khabar ai thi ki pakistan main daaud kii suraksha badha di gai he
 The debate over EVM and VVPAT has been going on in the country for a long time
 is bich chunaav ayog ne sarkaar ke us prastaav ko naamanzoor kar diya he, jisamen sarkaar kii ore se VVPAT mashiinon ko privet sector se kharidne kii salaah di gai thi
 The Election Commission has told the government that if this happens, the trust of the common man will be hurt
 angreji akhbaar indian express kii khabar ke anusaar, ye khulaasa ek artiai ke kaaran hua he
 In fact, the Law Ministry made this suggestion in july-september 2016 by writing three letters to the Election Commission
 jiskaa jawaab dete hue 19 sitambar, 2016 ko chunaav ayog ne kaha ki privet manuphacture ko is kaam kii jimmedaari nahin saunpi ja sakati he
 Significantly, during that time, Nasim Zaidi was the Chief Election Commissioner
 aapako bataa den ki abhi tak bharat main iviem or vivipat ko do public sector unit hi taiyaar karti rahi hai
 These machines are manufactured in Bharat Electronics Limited in Bangalore and Electronics Corporation of India Limited in Hyderabad
 aapako bataa den ki 2013 main supreme court ne chunaav main vivipat kaa istemaal karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 After which the Election Commission said that it will start arranging VVPAT till the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 chunaav ayog ne ye tark dekar sarkaar ke sujhaavon ko nakaara
 
 
 # If the private sector manufactures these machines, then common people will have less confidence in it
 # chunaav se pehle vivipat mashine raajnneetik partiyon ke saamne check hoti hai
 # Will the private company take responsibility of VVPAT machine for 14 years
 # privet company mashin main kis prakaar kaa suraksha feechar kaa upyog karti he, ye tay nahin he
 # Will the private company be able to guarantee the safety of VVPAT machines like BEL and ECIL
 jharkhand main in chunaavon main kshetreey mudda kuch zyada hi haaavee hota dikh rahaa he
 As a result of this, new parties have arisen on many regional issues and are also contesting more and more seats in the Lok Sabha
 inase congress or bhaajapa jaisi rashtriya partiyon kii dikkatein bad sakati hai
 These parties are also seen as possibilities of denting the jmm's base
 jharkhand ke purv mukhyamantri babulal marandi kii jharkhand vikaas morcha (prajatantric) party rajya kii sabhi 14 siton par chunaav lard rahi he
 Similarly, Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) is also in the fray for all seats
 to ol jharkhand students union (ageesu) chah loksabhaa siton par apane ummidavaar utaar rahi he
 The alliance between the two main parties of Bihar, RJD and LJP, has made the election contest more interesting
 rajd or lojpa chah or paanch siton par chunaav ladengi
 RJD has very little presence in the state, it has only two mps

 acute anseflitis syndrome (eies) se nipatane ke liye kii gai taiyaariyon kaa jayja lene ke liye bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne 18 june ko mujffarpur ke shri krishna medical college and hospital (eskeems) kaa daura kiya
 He asked the parents of all the children admitted to the pediatric ICU, "did you feed the child at night?" Most of the women who Nitish Kumar spoke to replied hesitantly, " She was hungry
 '' or bhi niraashajanak baat yah rahi ki aise bachche jinke mata-pita ne unhen khaali pet sula diya yaa phir jinhen raat main paryaapt bhojan nahin mila, unamem ladakiyon kii sankhya adhik thi
 In such a situation, it is not surprising that the number of girls in the list of AES victims is much higher than boys
 mujffarpur main eies se 129 bacchon kii maut hui, jinamein se 85 ladkiyaan thim
 Says a doctor at SKMCH, "this gives a glimpse of the undue preference of the patriarchal society of Bihar which reduces the care of the girl child
" yah bataata he ki aakhir bihar kaa linganupaat itnaa kharaab kyon he? 2011 kii janaganana ke mutabik, bihar main prati 1,000 purushon par 918 mahilaayein hai jo ki 940 ke rashtriya ausat se bahut kam he
 Medical experts also agree that there is a direct relationship between deaths on empty stomach and AES
 ijiiemes patna ke research vibhaag ke purv dean or patna ke indian council or medical research ke purv vaigyanik dow
 Prabhat Kumar Sinha explains, "blood sugar levels usually go down a lot in the morning time because there have been many hours of food
 yah kuposhit bachche ke maamle main or bhi badtar ho jaataa he jo raat ko bina khaae so jaataa ho
 This often leads to hypoglycemia
 '' dow
 "our brain needs normal levels of glucose in the blood to function," says Sinha
 jab liver is aavashyaktaa ko puraa karne main vifal rahata he, to hamaare sharir main glucose banane kaa ek vaikalpik tarika, jise fatty acid oxidation kaha jaataa he, khul jaataa he
 But methylene cyclopropyl glycine (MCPG) found in lychee blocks this alternative pathway, leading to seizures and in many cases leading to death
 ''darasal, bihar main desh ke kul 40 pratishat lichi kaa utpaadan hota he or mujffarpur iske liye kaaphi mashhoor he
 However, the toxin found in lychee harms malnourished children, as their blood sugar levels are low
 mujffarpur main marane vaale adhiktar bacchon main hypoglysemia (blad sugar kii kami) kaa 'ucch pratishat' paaya gaya tha
 Also on 16 June, when Union Health Minister Drs

 The disclosure of girls on a regular basis by parents is nothing short of a shock for Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 nitish kumaar rajya main lingabhed ko mitaakar nari ko shashakt banane kii apni koshishon ke liye jane jate hai
 They have taken steps like reserving 50 percent seats for women in panchayat and government jobs, fulfilling the desire of women, like complete prohibition in Bihar
 mukhyamatri ne ateet main balikaon ke kalyaan ke liye bhi kai kadam bhi uthaae hai
 These include offering free clothes, books and bicycles for school going girls, which led to a huge jump in enrollment in schools
 kaha ja rahaa he ki balikaon ke saath bhedbhaav ko lekar mukhyamantri ne apni niraashaa jaahir kii he
 He has ordered a socio-economic survey of more than 450 people, whose children are either affected by AES or lost their lives due to the disease
 mukhyamantri ke nirdeshon ke baad, sarkaar ne eies se prabhavit pariwaron kii sthiti kaa pataa lagane ke liye ek vistrut surveykshan karne kaa aadesh diya he
 The survey will be conducted by Jeevika, a rural livelihood program of the Bihar government
 jeevika kaaryakartaaon se kaha gaya he ki ve un ilaakon main prachlit saamaajik vyavhaar ke adhyayan ke saath-saath un kshetron kii swatchta sthiti kaa pataa lagaaein jahaan eies paaya gaya he
 The Chief Minister's direction is clear
 siem sachivalay main ek varisht adhikari kehete hai, ''mukhyamantri pehle yah jaananaa chaahate hai ki gramin kshetra main balikaon kii bhi dekhbhaal usee str kii kyon nahin ho rahi he jis str par baalkon kii dekhbhaal hoti he? agar surveykshan se hamaari ashankaon kii pushti hogi, to sarkaar apane sabhi sansadhano kaa upyog na keval chikitsa or aarthik bhalaai sunishchit karne ke liye karegi, balki gramin samaaj ko balikaon ke prati samvedansheel banane ke liye bhi karegi
 The survey will also evaluate Bihar's Integrated Child Development Services, which works to provide nutrition and health for children under six years of age
 dow
 Sinha points out that AES affects the central nervous system of most children and begins with high fever
 iske baad yah neurological kaaryon ko baadhit karnaa shuru karata he jisase dimagi rup se sadma, daura padana , coma or mrityu tak ho jaati he
 "malnutrition, death from AES can be a major cause," he says
 acchhee tarah se poshit bacchon ke vipareet, kuposhit bacchon ke liver main glikojan bahut kam hota he
 The brain requires glucose as a source of energy, but malnourished children have very little sugar
 glucose str main achaanak giravat se daure padate hai or mrityu ho jaati he
 "A preliminary assessment of the families affected by AES shows that the majority of the victims belong to scheduled castes and other weaker sections of the society and they all fall in the economically disadvantaged groups
" prabhavit pariwaron main se adhiktar yaa to nirakshar hai yaa bahut hi kam shikshit hai
 Earning members of many families are working as migrant workers
 eies ke kaarnon kaa pataa lagane main sarkaar kaa naakaam rahanaa bhi ek pramukh chikitsiya baadha he
 Other causes were attributed to the outbreak of encephalitis in Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, while the Japanese encephalitis virus has been largely controlled by immunizing most children in Muzaffarpur and neighboring districts of Bihar
 lekin eies ke maamalon main doctor keval lakshanon ke aadhaar par dextroj seline (ek sugar ghol jise aksar nason main chadhaaya jaataa he) jaise ilaaj karne ko majaboor hai kyonki eies ke spasht kaarnon kaa ab tak pataa nahin chal paaya he
 Eating litchi on empty stomach of children is also a factor in aggravating this disease
 jaahir he, eies kii vajah se itani badi sankhya main bacchon kii maut ne sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par sawaal khadey kar die hai
 And has also posed a serious challenge to Nitish Kumar, who advocates empowerment from girls
 eies se nipatane ke liye unki sarkaar kuposhan or balikaon ke saath bhedbhaav ko kaise khatm karegi

 Darkness on the lunar surface is controlled by the abundance of iron-rich minerals found there
 aise khanij budh kii sataha par durlabh hai
 Earlier scientists had said that the darkness on Mercury could be due to the carbon that would have slowly accumulated due to comets traveling in the inner solar system
 america kii jon hopkins uniwarsity ke petric peploski ke netritv main shodhakartaaon ne is baat kii pushti kii he ki budh kii sataha par carbon atyadhik maatra main he
 They have also found that this carbon seems to originate in the depths of the planet's surface rather than being collected from comets
 shodhakartaaon ne yah data nasa ke massenger marakari sarphase, spes enwyrement, jiyochemistry and reging: naamak antariksh yaan se hasil kiya he
 This is the first space mission sent into Mercury's orbit
 tippaniyan "we took the help of Messenger's neutron spectrometer to understand the distribution of carbon and found that it is associated with the darkest matter on Mercury and that the substance is in contact with it," said Larry Knittler, deputy chief investigator of the Messenger campaign and working at the Carnegie Institution of Washington

 Hiraben lives a simple life and travels by public transport
 pichhali baar vah niyamit jaanch ke liye gandhinagar ke sarkari aspataal auto rickshaw se ai thim
 During the demonetisation, Heeraben went to change the money in the bank
 dilli ke ek behad mahfuj sarkari colony se shanivaar dopaher baad jo khabar ai usne dilli waalon ke saath hi police or desh kii sabase badi khufia agency ro ko bhi dahala diya
 Actually, here, not one or two but four corpses came out from the house of a RAW field officer ie government detective

 While the remaining three corpses belonged to his wife, son and daughter
 dakshin dilli kaa sadik nagar ilaake main ro afasar kii laash ghar main pankhe se jhulati mili

 dopaher ke 3 baj kar 57 minute par dephence colony thane ko phone par jaankaree mili ki sadik nagar ke sarkari flats number- 47 tip-4, sector teen main kuch gadabad he
 All the neighbors are gathered outside the house but no one is opening the door of the house
 phone karne vaale ne bataaya ki ye sarkari flats bhartiya khufia agency ro yani research and analysis wing ke field afasar ananyaa chakravarti kaa he
 The maid rang the bell, but the police team rushed to the spot as soon as the door was opened

 padosiyon ne bhi darwaja khulwaane kii kaaphi koshish kii, lekin darwaja nahin khulaa jiske baad khidki kaa sheesha todakar andar jhaankna chaha
 But nothing showed there

 As soon as the police entered inside by breaking the door, everyone's senses flew away

 Four corpses and many questions seemed clear to him at first sight that Chakraborty committed a noose around his neck and killed his wife, son and daughter by striking him with his head
 lekin yah sirf pehali najar kii tasviir thi
 Ananya Chakraborty was a RAW field officer and most importantly, he was a lively person
 phir wo khudakushi kaise kar sakate hai? to kya in chaar mauton ke peeche koi gahari sajeesh he? kya ye sachmuch khudakushi kaa maamla he
 Or is it being proved suicide? The matter is related to the RAW agent posted in the Cabinet Secretariat, which is why the police is investigating every aspect by putting every aspect in front
 ro ke aalaa afasaron ko bhi is bare main aagaah kar diya gaya he
 The electricity of the house was cut off from Friday night, the electricity of the official of the house was cut off from Friday night

 input- bhashaa After the results of Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has given a message to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 mangalvaar ko sansad ke baahar patrakaron ko sambodhit karte hue rahul ne kaha ki gujarat kii janata ne piem modi or bijepi ko massej diya he, gussa aapke kaam nahin aayega balki pyaar hi kaam aayega
 Please tell that after the defeats in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh, Rahul came to the media for the first time
 rahul ke sambodhan kii badi baaten
 
 
 # The people of Gujarat have not liked Modi ji's model
 piem modi kaa vikaas model khokhla he
 # PM Modi's propaganda is good, marketing is good
 lekin logon ko ye pasand nahin he
 # Gujarat results are a setback for BJP, results have been good for us
 # gujarat ke logon ne sikhaa diya ki aapke paas kitna bhi gussa ho, dhan ho par vipaksh main rahakar bhi aap pyaar se takkar de sakate hai
 # Gandhiji had already taught this thing, even now this thing is in the people of Gujarat
 # hamane modi ji se vikaas par jawaab maange the, lekin wo nahin de paae the
 He had maintained silence in the Jai shah-rafael case
 # main gujarat gaya, 3 maheene main logon ko apni baat bataai
 We could win, we could not win but there was a shortage
 # modiji bol rahe hai ye nattejey jiesti-vikaas par muhar he
 But these things were not mentioned in the campaign
 unke bhaashanon se notebandi or jiesti gaayab tha
 # Gujarat election results have raised questions on Modiji's credibility, what he is saying is just his organization repeating
 lekin desh unki baat nahin sun rahaa he
 In Gujarat, the Congress has won 80 seats out of 182 seats with allies
 jabaki bijepi ne 99 siton par paracham laharaaya he
 One seat has gone to the ncp's account
 aapako bataa den ki somvaar ko nateezon ke baad dilli membijapi mukhyalayapar piem modi kaa swaagat kiya tha
 During this, Modi, while addressing the workers, attacked the Congress fiercely without naming him
 unhone kaha tha ki jab uttar pradesh main mahanagar, palika ke chunaav chal rahe the to bade jor se kaha ja rahaa tha ki jiesti ke kaaran upi ke shaharon main bijepi khatm ho jaaegi
 Similar rumors were asserted even before the Gujarat elections
 pichley dinon maharashtra main bhi jiesti ke baad nikaay ke chunaav hue, vahaan bhi bijepi ko samarthan mila
 Modi said that i urge the intellectuals who want the good of the country, we who sit here and do the general human assessment of the country
 galat disha main chale jate hai
 It does not benefit those who think like this
 jis kshetra or janata ke liye sochaa jaataa he unka bhala nahin hota he
 The country is repeatedly damaged
 ek taraf jahaan bijepi gujarat or himachal pradesh vidhansabha chunaav kii taiyaariyon main juty he, vahiin somvaar ko punjab kii gurdaspur loksabhaa seat par hue upachunaav main congress ne use bada jhatka diya
 Congress candidate Sunil Jakhar won this seat which was vacant after the death of BJP MP Vinod Khanna
 vahiin isse pehle shanivaar der raat purab kii oxford kahi jane vaali elahabaad central uniwarsity chaatrasangh chunaav ke nattejey bhi bijepi ko jhatka dene vaale hi rahe
 While looking at the results of the students' union elections held in other big universities of the country this year, they also testify to the weakening graph of ABVP
 elahabaad uniwarsity main is baad bijepi samarthit chaatr sanghathan abivipi ko badi jhatka laga or samaajawaadee party ke chaatr sanghathan samaajawaadee chaatr sabha ne joardaar jeet hasil kii
 SP students all captured four of the five seats
 jabaki abivipi ke khate main sirf mahasachiv kii seat gai
 These results are being considered a major setback for ABVP because ABVP had been in possession of Allahabad University for the last two years
 saal 2015 main abivipi ne paanch main se chaar siten hasil kii thim, jabaki 2016 main adhyaksh or sanyukt sachiv pad par abivipi ke ummidavaar jite the
 This year, ABVP has also lost to Jawaharlal Nehru University, Hyderabad Central University, Delhi University, Jaipur University, Gangtok University, Garhwal Central University and Punjab University before the Allahabad University of Allahabad
 DU main 4 saal baad chhini sattadilli uniwarsity main 2017 ke chaatrasangh chunaav main bhi abivipi ko karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 While NSUI, the student unit of the Congress, got big success here
 NSUI ne adhyaksh pad or upaadhyaksh pad jeet darj kar jabardast vaapasi kii
 Whereas in the account of ABVP, the post of Joint Secretary and Secretariat was done
 dusu ke nattejey abivipi ke liye isliye hanikaarak maane gaye kyonki yahaan pichley 4 saal se adhyaksh or upaadhyaksh pad par uskaa kabja tha
 JNU Students' Association of 2015 vacant in JNU was also very popular
 kyonki is dauraan kanhaiya kumaar adhyaksh the or shahala raashid upaadhyaksh
 Both are students from Left organizations
 jabaki isi chaatrasangh main abivipi ke saurabh sharma joint secretary bane
 This entire year was full of controversies for JNU
 farvari kii ghatana ke baad 2016 kaa chunaav left sanghathanon ne milakar ladaa or abivipi kaa safaya kar diya
 Left student leaders followed the same strategy in the 2017 election and once again waved the red seats in the four seats of the Central Panel
 yani abivipi ko ek bhi seat haath nahin lagi
 The Rajasthan University, which is considered to be the stronghold of ABVP, also had to face defeat of BJP candidate for the post of President this time
 adhyaksh pad par abivipi se baagi hue pawan yadav ko jeet mili thi or 2656 voton se abivipi pratyaashee ko haraaya tha
 The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) also suffered defeat at the University of Hyderabad
 student federation of india (esefai) or ambedkar student association (eyese) ke gathbandhan vaali 'elliance for soshal justise' (eysge) ne sabhi padon par jeet darj kii
 In all the major universities of the country, the ABVP got this defeat at a time when the BJP formed a government in UP with a big majority
 saath hi uttarakhand, goa or manipur main jaise chote rajyon main bhi satta par kabiz hui
 On the one hand, after the huge victory of Modi in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP has won its glory in more than 15 states of the country, now even after three years of Modi government, the youth of the university are disenchanted with ABVP, Rahul Gandhi and Opposition Forces the charges

 khanan kii badi gatividhi hameshaa hi sthaneey paryaavaran ko ujaad dene vaali maani jaati he
 It seems that Bihar's Nitish Kumar government believes in this
 pathar kii khadaanon ke liye patta na dene yaa unka navinikaran na karne ke sarkari kadam ne yah saaf kar diya he ki bekhauf khanan operataron ne bihar kii bhusmpada ko kis kadar lutaa hoga
 The verdict is actually in 2010, but its impact is slowly being felt
 pathar kii khadaanon ke patte ke navinikaran kii jab tak anumati thi, jile ke varisht adhikariyon ne maukey par yah jaanchane kii kabhi koi jarurat nahin samajhi ki jis ilaake kii khudaai kii gai he, vah vastav main patte par die gaye ilaake se mail bhi khaataa he yaa nahin
 This was often due to bureaucratic negligence or sometimes collusion

 The mining companies, in search of good quality stones, destroyed all the mountains of the mountains with explosives, etc
 ab khanan patton kii avadhi samaapt karne ke baad se halaat badal gaye hai
 Illegal mining activities are becoming more visible
 nateezaah rajya bhar main lagaataar chhapemari
 But the district of Sheikhpura is an example of how the scams can be uncovered secretly if the bureaucracy intervenes properly
 is jile main 74 stone krashing plant dhwast ho chuke hai
 "these plants were running without proper license," says District Collector Virendra Prasad Yadav
 kai maamalon main yah bhi paaya gaya ki in logon ne khadaanon se pathar nikaale the, jabaki unke paas koi patta nahin tha
 "around 40 per cent of the stone-leased quarries in Bihar are in Sheikhpura
 avaidh khanan ke khilaaf abhiyaan chhedane vaale yadav kehete hai, ''ab tak ham kanoon todane vaale 250 se zyada logon ke khilaaf exiar darj kar chuke hai
 Many have been arrested
 ''is karrwai ne jaise barr kaa chhatta ched diya he
 It has been shown how the ministers of the Mining Department had been giving opportunities for illegal mining in Bihar to flourish for years
 bihar ko sthiti kii gambhirtha kaa ehsaas november, 2000 main rajya ke vibhaajan ke baad hua
 "after the creation of Jharkhand, there were very few hills left in Bihar," says a mining department official
 rajya ke netaaon ko yah samajhane main thodaa samay laga ki andhadhundh khanan bihar main bachi pahadiyon ke ikkaa-dukka shikharon ko hameshaa ke liye samtal kar chukaa he
 "it was also discovered that in the case of every one meter leased land, irrespective mining operators dug a meter and stone from the land, which had to suffer the revenue of the government and the environment
 police mukhyalay ke sutara bataate hai ki or bade masale bhi isse jude rahe hai
 Illegal stone crushing units operating in Maoist-affected districts often had deep ties with the Maoists
 aise suraag bhi mili ki maovadiyon ko rajya ke naksalwad prabhavit ilaakon main chal rahi stone krashing ikaayiyon ke jariye visphotak supplai kiye ja rahe the
 The decision not to lease or renew stone mines is being called a bold decision
 yah tab liya gaya jab rajya apane buniyadi dhaanche kaa punarnirmaan kar rahaa he or nirmaan kaa kaam bhi jor-shor se chal rahaa he
 But Bihar is more concerned about the environment because the mining industry has riddled the hills
 sarkaar ko ummid he ki khanan rokane se rajasav par asar nahin padegaa kyonki ret or eent-bhatthon jaise anya sansaadhan bihar main bharpoor hai
 "to save its environment, ecology, plants and animals, Bihar is now prohibiting excavation and mining activities," says an official
 ''khanan vibhaag ne ek badi shart yah laga di he ki pattharon kii khudaai ke liye koi lij nahin di jaaegi
 Earlier leases will be valid but will not be renewed
 sari maujuuda lij 2014 main samaapt hone kii sambhaavna he
 That is, Bihar will soon become a quarry free state
 paksh-vipaksh main lobbiyaan taiyaar hai par yah tay he ki nitish sarkaar is par punarvichaar nahin karne vaali
 The detention of mining will change the nature of business in these poor districts
 varanaa ye shahar pattharon kii khadaanon ke liye hi jite-marate the
 Whatever was to happen has been done
 ab bihar ke adhikariyon ko bhed kii khaal lapete un naukarshahon ko talashna chahie, jo itane barason tak avaidh khanan ko apane paison kii khadaan banaate rahe
 Those who allowed this to continue, are still outside the purview of the law

 20 lakh rupees kendriya videsh rajyamantri general wike singh ne somvaar ko kaha ki bijepi hameshaa se sena kaa sammaan karti he or sainikon ke hit main sochati he
 He said that in case of 'one Rank One Pension' (OROP) of retired soldiers, some complexities will be rectified and implemented
 singh ne kaha, 'bijepi hameshaa se sena or sainikon kaa sammaan karti he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi agrees on the OROP, but it will be implemented by fixing some technical intricacies to create an illegal hurdle later
 ' kendriya mantri bhopal main 10 se 12 sitambar tak yojit hone vaale vishwa hindi sammelan kii taiyaariyon kaa jayja lene pahunche the
 'not approved due to Congress policies', he said that in 2011, the OROP scheme was audited as his army chief
 is par 3200 karod kaa kharch saamne aayaa tha, lekin congress kii aguwai vaali upie sarkaar kii nitiyon ke kaaran yah manjuur nahin hui
 VK Singh said that now it will cost more than 8,000 crores to implement
 lekin unka maananaa he kisainikon ke hit mendesh yah kharch vahan kar saktaa he or isamen prativarsh koi bada ijapha bhi nahin hoga

 lekin is maamle main nai dilli nagar nigam (endiemasi) adhik doshi he, jisane unke tent or anya saamaan ko tabadatod hataaya tha

 Are children really supposed to read so many books (subjects)? The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has a clear view that children from first to fifth should be taught only four subject books
 soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat praathmik kakshaon main kitaaben padhaane ke sandarbh main maangi gai jaankaree ke jawaab main ensiartii ne bataaya he ki pehali or duusari kaksha main ganit, bhashaa (maatrubhaasha yaa kshetreey bhashaa) or angreji (vaikalpik) vishay kii kitaaben padhai jaani chahie
 This means that three subjects should be taught in these two classes
 ensiiarti ke jawaab main aage kaha gaya he ki kaksha teesri se paanchavin tak ganit, bhashaa (maatrubhaasha yaa kshetreey bhashaa), angreji (vaikalpik) or paryaavaran adhyayan vishay padhaaye jane chahie, yani teesri se paanchavin tak ke paathyakram main adhiktam chaar vishay hi hone chahie
 The comments iske alaava ensiiartii ne apane jawaab main vidyalayon main chalaae jane vaale vishyon or bhashaa kaa chayan rajyon ke liye aichhik rakhaa he
 Right to information activist and resident of Neemuch district of Madhya Pradesh, Chandrashekhar Gaur wanted to know from the Department of Elementary Education and Literacy of the Ministry of Human Resource Development that according to the National Curriculum Framework (NCF), which children from 1st to 8th Subject books can be read
 ensiiartii ne 28 disambar, 2015 ko jawaab bheja
 On this answer, Gaur has said that for the children of primary classes, such a recommendation would probably be made by the NCF experts, keeping in view the physical and mental level of the children of classes i to v unhone kaha ki yadi eemaandaaree se ensief kii anushansa deshbhar ke kam se kam sibiesai skulon main hi lagu ho jaae to bacchon ko boj or abhibhavakon ko shoshan se bachaaya ja saktaa he
 In response to the information sought in the context of teaching books in primary classes under Right to Information, NCRTE has stated that books of Mathematics, Language (mother tongue or regional language) and English (optional) should be taught in first and second grade
 iskaa aashay saaf he ki in do kakshaon main teen vishay hi padhaaye jane chahie

 narendra damodaradaas modi ek tufaan kaa sabab bane hue hai
 To call it a storm would be to underestimate the economic storm that came in the country after the Prime Minister's announcement to close the big notes on November 8
 is andhad ne 15 lakh karod ru
 Took his notes in his lap and turned them into trash
 sirf ek faisle ne sab kuch lip-pot kar baraabar kar diya, jiske baad kya amir or kya garib, donon hi puraane note badalane or nae note nikaalane ke liye bainkon kii lambii sarpili kataron main ek saath khadey najar aae
 This decision shaken the foundation of India's economy and dwarfed the growth in all important sectors
 yahaan tak ki khud modi sarkaar maan rahi he ki iskaa bura asar march 2017 tak kahin nahin jane vaala he
 However, he is confident that the economy will be back on track after that
 jinhen modi main shraddha he—or modi kaa daawa he ki aise adhisankhya log hai—unke liye vimudrikaran yaa notebandi beyimaani se paisa jamaa karne waalon ke khilaaf ek tagada jhatka he
 The poor Gurba people were ready to stand in queues and suffer until the rich got killed
 unhen laga ki yah faisla ek palatwaar he, cancer kii tarah hamaari raajnneeti main fail chuke kaale dhan ke rog ke khilaaf ek nirnaayak karrwai he
 Those who disagree — and there are increasing numbers of people, including top economists — consider Modi a master of dreams

 These people are saying that demonetisation has failed in the primary objective of uprooting black money and the pain it has caused to the economy is not going to make any profit
 faisla hona ab bhi baaki he, lekin modi is tufaan ke bichobich bilkul shant hai
 Despite the devastation caused by his decision, he is confident

 There was no burden of files on his desk and everything was perfectly decorated
 diwaar par tangi tasviir se mahatma gandhi kii kaatar nigaah unke upar baras rahi thi
 The Prime Minister said that when he came to this office two and a half years ago, he made only one change that he installed two statues of his two favorite heroes (both Gujaratis) Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Mahatma Gandhi, in which both would communicate
 Let's look
 saath lage ek kamare main us vakt unke mantri cabinet kii baithak ke liye ikattha ho rahe the jisamen anya chizon ke alaava is par bhi baat kii jaani thi ki notebandi par or kya kadam uthaae jane hai
 Totally sitting on the chair, Modi shrugged off the dust of criticism from his shoulder, saying, "you understand that we have not taken the decision of demonetisation for short term benefit, but it is for long term structural change
" hamaara uddeshy vastav main arthvyavastha or samaaj ko kaale dhan ke abhishaap se mukti dilaanaa tha tathaa us avishvaas, nakli dabaavon or duusari bimariyon ko khatm karnaa tha, jo uske saath chali aati hai

 It was in this room that Jawaharlal Nehru first laid the foundation for and planned the four pillars, later known as Nehruism — secularism, self-reliance, mixed economy, and non-alignment

 The same year he abolished the princely prince of the monarchy, which was not initially passed in Parliament but later came into force in 1971 when he won a majority in elections

 After years of becoming Prime Minister, Modi is also trying to establish his rule on this slogan

 This decision affected merit and was a major setback for the feudal elites, whose impact is being felt till date, but it put people from backward communities and castes in the first line of political and economic power

 Together with Manmohan Singh, he announced economic reforms, including the end of the license permit raj, freeing the private sector from restrictions and opening up the economy to foreign investment

 baavjood iske haal ke pradhanmantri apane kaarykaal ke pehle varsh main hi apane nirnaayak faisle lete rahe hai lekin modi ko aisa karne main aadha kaarykaal biit gaya
 After showing himself market friendly on the economic front, when he came to power, it seemed that his steps should not break the trust
 unke aarambhik do bajet bade aarthik sudhaaron ke vaahak nahin rahe, balki nirantarata or maamuli badlaav kii niti ko darshaate rahe
 When we expected the least from him, just then he broke the demonetisation bomb and created an economic policy
 is faisle ke peeche pradhanmantri kaa tark yah he ki ''bharat ko viksit raashtra or vaishvik takat" banane ke liye yahaan kaala dhan khatm karne kii tatkaal jarurat thi
 He also said that this step is to stop the terrorist groups and fake currency printers who do their work from across the border

 unhen aadhuniktaa ke mahaan vaahak kii tarah dikhaaya gaya jo len-dein ko digital banane or kam nakadi vaali arthvyavastha ko kaayam karne ke liye protsaahan de rahaa he
 All these goals are laudable, but there is a political reason behind this and this matter is not taken just for the purpose of winning the upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh
 modi darasal indira gandhi dwaara apanaai ranneeti ko doharaa rahe hai taaki unhen garibon or vanchiton ke nae maseehaa ke rup main dekha ja sake
 In the process of doing so, they go beyond caste and religious manipulations while exploiting the socio-economic inequalities that come with an economy that runs fast
 yah mandal se bhi badi soshal ejineering he
 Instead of religious divisions, it seems that Modi is playing on the land of class division and raising the rich and the poor against each other
 iske mul main sandesh yah he ki vetanbhogi or kaamgaar tabaka eemaandaar karadaata he jabaki amir log vyavastha kii khaamiyon kaa dohan karke avaidh dhan jamaa kar lete hai
 In such a situation, Modi's mantra is that he not only wants to create wealth (by supporting industrial growth) but is also pushing for its redistribution so that it can end inequality and exploitation which continues to harass the working class
 
 yah nav-marxvad or bazaar kaa ek aisa sammishran he jo assi ke dashak main china main deng shiyaoping ne saakaar kiya tha
 As a senior official puts it, "it is very straightforward and true that the Prime Minister sees himself in the wider context as a reformer — not just an economic but also social reformer
" "aisa karte vakt modi bijepi or bhagava parivaar ke paaramparik vot bank ke paar ja rahe hai jiske peeche yah apeksha he ki 2019 tak party ke matadaataaon kaa aadhaar or chaudaa hoga
 Modi is developing a new version of the poverty alleviation program, which was once the center of the Congress party's electoral strategy, along the same lines as he used the mantra of development in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 Arvind Kejriwal started his political journey by riding on the boat of the protest

 The elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab will test Modi's experiments

 Especially after this decision, when the economy has slowed down and money manipulators have found new ways to make hoarding money white

 The news coming from rural areas is presenting a disappointing picture, especially from informal sector which is dependent on cash only
 arthvyavastha ke kai ahm kshetron main bikri or sevaaon main giravat kii khabar ai he
 Despite this, lice do not crawl on Modi's ear
 unka aatmavishvaas un gananaaon se paidaa ho rahaa he jo unki sarkaar ne kiye hai
 That is, Rs 1,000
 ke kareeb do-tihaai note or 500 ru
 One-third of the notes were not in flux but were deposited
 in noton ko khule main aupchaarik arthtantr ke bheetar laakar sarkaar ko aarthik dand se atirikt laabh milegaa
 Modi's team believes that with so much cash flow, it will play a catalyst in growth

 They also believe that by the end of January, the cash crisis will also reduce

 It can be used to reduce tax and boost incentives and cheap loans, especially for small and medium sector, in order to boost economic growth
 is bich, 2016 main modi videsh niti ke morche par bhi game-changer sabit hue
 Despite his Banisbatan nativism, at the very beginning of his term, he surprised everyone with his "neighborhood-first" policy and using economic diplomacy to push his hand towards superpower countries
 magar dil jeetne kii shuruaati muhim ke baad, jinamein lahore kii achaanak yatra bhi thi, pakistan se rishte sudhaarney kii unki koshishen khatai main pad gayi
 Modi retaliated in September and successfully carried out the biggest surgical strike by sneaking deep within Pakistan's border
 do hafte pehle udi main ek faujee tukdi ke upar hamale ke baad unhen yah kadam uthaanaa padaa
 His message was: i am not like the previous ruler
 main peeche hatakar nahin kheloongaa or na hi dabbu banakar rahoonga taaki tum meri pratikriya kii koi parvaah na karo
 He also raised the issue of rethinking the Indus Waters Treaty and extended a hand of sympathy to the separatists in Bluechistan to provoke Pakistan
 bharat kii pratikriya main anischitata kaa ek tatv laakar modi ne pakistan ke saath rishton ke afsane ko pakke taur par badal diya
 An officer working closely with him says that Modi does not do anything impulsively or in excitement
 ve kehete hai ki agar aap videshi niti ke morche par alag-alag uthaae gaye kadamon ko jodakar samajhane kii koshish karte to aapako pataa chal jaataa ki iskaa anjaam pakistan ke khilaaf sargical strike main hoga
 Modi had already entered surgical strikes against the rebels in the Northeast by entering within Myanmar
 jise unke aalochak bharat kii pakistan niti main jhol qaraar dete hai, usamen ek taarkik sangati he
 On many occasions he showed the world that he was ready to go beyond the need to improve relations with Pakistan
 lekin agar pakistani phir se apane puraane khote taur-tareeke par waapas jate hai, to ve unhen bakhshenge bhi nahin or sajaa denge
 Step-by-step preparations were made on the black money front and the move to a less cash economy

 Then went to bring back the black money deposited in foreign banks

 Then he went and attacked black money through demonetisation

 He is the person who sets the agenda
 unamem jokhim uthaane kii himmat or dilari he, par ve soch-samaj or naap-taul ke baad aisa karte hai
 But if he took the initiative, he does not believe in half-way measures
 "isamen koi shaq nahin ki siyaasi falak par modi kaa bolbalaa he or unhen asal chunauti dene vaala koi nahin he
 The threat to Modi today will come not from the opposition, but from within his own group
 ek bade vishleshak bataate hai ki pichhali baar rajeev gandhi ko baghawat unke sabase bharosemand sahyogi ve

 By leaving the demonetisation monster open, Modi risked offending the bjp's solid supporters and businessmen

 Among other things, the thieves carried the replica of the Nobel Prize

 Rakesh Sengar, associated with his NGO 'bachpan Bachao Andolan', told that when he reached Kailash's house at around 9 am, he saw a dhobi ringing the doorbell repeatedly
 is par rakesh ne kaha ki vah to baahar gaye hai, ghanti kyon baja rahe ho
 During this, Rakesh's eyes fell on the lock, which was broken
 rakesh ne jab ghar ke andar jaakar dekha to paaya ki ghar main saamaan bikharaa padaa he or ghar se mahangaa saamaan gaayab he
 The biggest thing is that the replica of the Nobel Prize awarded to Kailash is also missing

 When Rakesh went inside the house, he found that the house was scattered and expensive items were missing from the house
 sabase badi baat yah he ki kailash ko mili nobel puraskaar kaa replika bhi gaayab he
 Actually, after receiving the Nobel Prize, Kailash submitted the original award to Rashtrapati Bhavan
 unka kahana tha ki vah ise desh ke naam samarpit kar rahe hai
 While he received the replica he received at his home

 shina bora hatyakand main peter mukherjee kii giraftaar ne mumbai police par kai sawaal khadey kar die hai
 The question is what evidence the CBI has found against Peter Mukherjee that he suddenly arrested Peter
 vah bhi thik usee din jis din usne pehle se giraftaar teen aropiyon ke khilaaf aarope patr daayar kiya
 CBI sources have revealed that the ground for Peter's arrest was prepared after questioning Indrani
 mumbai police se kai din kii lagaataar poochtacha main bhi peter ne shinabora kii hatya kii jaankaree se inkaar kiya tha
 Peter also said that he still knew that Sheena was the daughter of his wife Indrani
 indrani ne use apni choti bahan ke taur par hi use milwaaya tha
 But information is being received that Peter's plea was not embraced by the CBI
 kyonki shina bora ke achaanak laapata hone ke baad peter ne use khojane kii koi koshish nahin kii
 He blindly trusted Indrani that Sheena went to live in America forever
 sawaal he kya koi is tarah bina bataaye ja saktaa he? Sheena may not tell anything to Peter, but she would have told Peter's son and her lover Rahul Mukherjee, but she didn't tell Rahul anything
 24 april 2012 ko shina ko indrani kii car tak chhodane vaala rahul hi tha
 Upset over the sudden disappearance of Sheena, she wanted to file a missing complaint in different police stations in Mumbai, but even then the police did not trust Indrani's complaint
 bataate hai ki rahul ne peter ko ek baar poocha bhi tha ki shina kaa passport to uske paas he phir vah america kaise ja sakati he
 Indrani had then said that Sheena had got a new passport made
 kam se kam tab peter ko indrani par shaq karnaa chahie tha, lekin peter ne to rahul ko hi daantkar chup kara diya tha
 Apart from this, the owner of the car agency AM Motor, which was used to kill Sheena and take her body, is also Peter's friend and the car was also booked in the name of Peter
 yani kai aisi baaten hai, jo peter mukherjee ko andeh ko ghere main laati hai
 So the CBI feels that Peter was aware of the killing of Sheena Bora, but he kept it hidden
 isliye usne pehle se giraftar shina kii maa indrani mukherjee, sautele pita sanjeev khanna or driver shyamvar raay ke khilaaf aarope patr daayar karte hi peter ko bhi giraftaar kar liya
 Now the CBI is starting to know whether Peter was aware of Sheena's murder before or after the crime was committed
 If already done, Peter could be accused of plotting murder
 agar baad main hui hogi thi aropiyon khaskar indrani ko bachaane ke liye sachai chhipaane kaa aarope ban saktaa he
 The comments isse saath hi sibiai ne peter mukherjee ke bete rahul se 12 ghante se zyada samay tak poochtacha kii
 Sources said that Rahul reportedly had a love affair with Sheena
 use kal raat dakshini mumbai sthit sibiai karyaalay bulaayaa gaya
 He was seen coming out of the CBI office at around 10
30 am this morning
 sutron ne kaha ki rahul se yah poocha gaya tha ki kya usne or shina ne peter ko yah bataaya tha ki shina indrani kii bahan nahin balki beti he

 Sources said that Rahul reportedly had a love affair with Sheena

 He was seen coming out of the CBI office at around 10
30 am this morning
 sutron ne kaha ki rahul se yah poocha gaya tha ki kya usne or shina ne peter ko yah bataaya tha ki shina indrani kii bahan nahin balki beti he
 He said that he was also asked whether he had ever raised concerns about Sheena's safety after the disappearance of Sheena in 2012? (inputs bhashaa se bhi) Rahul was the one who left Sheena till Indrani's car on 24 April 2012
 shina ke achaanak laapata hone se pareshaan hokar usne mumbai ke alag- alag thanon main laapata kii shikaayat darj karaani chaahi thi, lekin tab police ne bhi indrani kii baat par bharosa kar shikaayat darj nahin kiya tha
 It is said that Rahul once asked Peter that Sheena's passport is with him, then how can she go to America
 tab indrani ne kaha tha ki shina ne nayaa passport banavaa liya he
 At least then Peter should have doubted Indrani, but Peter had scolded and silenced Rahul
 iske alaava shina kii hatya or uskaa shav le jane ke liye bhi kiraaye kii jis car kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha us car agency eem motor kaa maalik bhi peter kaa dost he or car bhi peter ke naam se hi book thi
 That is, there are many such things which bring doubt to Peter Mukherjee
 isliye sibiai ko lagata he ki peter ko shina bora kii hatya kii jaankaree thi, lekin unhone chipaaye rakhaa
 So he also arrested Peter as soon as he filed a charge sheet against Girfatar Sheena's mother Indrani Mukherjee, stepfather Sanjeev Khanna and driver Shyamvar Rai
 ab sibiai yah jaanane main lagi he ki peter ko shina kii hatya kii jaanakri vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke pehle se thi yaa phir baad main? agar pehle se hogi to peter hatya kii sajeesh ke aaropee ban sakate hai
 If it had happened later, the accused could be accused of hiding the truth, especially to save Indrani
 tippaniyan With this, the CBI questioned Peter Mukherjee's son Rahul for more than 12 hours
 sutron ne kaha ki rahul kaa shina ke saath kathith taur par prem sambandh tha
 He was called to the CBI office in south Mumbai last night
 use aaj subah lagbhag saadhe das baje sibiai karyaalay se baahar aate hue dekha gaya
 Sources said that Rahul was asked whether he and Sheena had told Peter that Sheena was not Indrani's sister but a daughter
 unhone kaha ki usase yah bhi poocha gaya ki varsh 2012 main shina ke gaayab ho jane ke baad kya usne kabhi shina kii suraksha ko lekar chintaa jataai thi? (also from the input language) bataate hai ki rahul ne peter ko ek baar poocha bhi tha ki shina kaa passport to uske paas he phir vah america kaise ja sakati he
 Indrani had then said that Sheena had got a new passport made
 kam se kam tab peter ko indrani par shaq karnaa chahie tha, lekin peter ne to rahul ko hi daantkar chup kara diya tha
 Apart from this, the owner of the car agency AM Motor, which was used to kill Sheena and take her body, is also Peter's friend and the car was also booked in the name of Peter

 isliye usne pehle se giraftar shina kii maa indrani mukherjee, sautele pita sanjeev khanna or driver shyamvar raay ke khilaaf aarope patr daayar karte hi peter ko bhi giraftaar kar liya
 Now the CBI is starting to know whether Peter was aware of Sheena's murder before or after the crime was committed

 He said that he was also asked whether he had ever raised concerns about Sheena's safety after the disappearance of Sheena in 2012? (inputs bhashaa se bhi) That is, there are many such things which bring doubt to Peter Mukherjee
 isliye sibiai ko lagata he ki peter ko shina bora kii hatya kii jaankaree thi, lekin unhone chipaaye rakhaa
 So he also arrested Peter as soon as he filed a charge sheet against Girfatar Sheena's mother Indrani Mukherjee, stepfather Sanjeev Khanna and driver Shyamvar Rai
 ab sibiai yah jaanane main lagi he ki peter ko shina kii hatya kii jaanakri vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke pehle se thi yaa phir baad main? agar pehle se hogi to peter hatya kii sajeesh ke aaropee ban sakate hai

 The GDP figures for the first quarter of the current financial year have brought great relief for the Central Government
 haalanki aarthik jaankaron kaa daawa he ki pehali timahi ke aankadon main aarthik sthiti kaa vah jayja nahin miltaa jisase kisi ko khush hone kii vajah mili
 This is because while the fourth quarter figures clearly indicate the direction of economic growth for the entire year, the figures for the first quarter are based only on quick estimates
 lihaaja pehali timahi kaa aankada sanket maatr detaa hai ki agali teen timahi main arthvyavastha kaisaa kar sakati he
 The growth rate during the first quarter (april-june) of FY 2018-19 tops two years
 2 fisadi par pahunch gai
 It is worth noting that the gross value added (GVA) growth rate during the quarter stood at 8 per cent and the figures reflect growth by producer or supply, while GDP figures reflect consumer or demand centers
 gauratlab he ki pichley vitt varsh kii aakhri timahi ke dauraan vikaas dar 7

 garg ne kaha ki isse pehle 8 fisadi kii vikaas dar 2016-17 kii pehali timahi main darj hui thi
 Now after 8 quarters, growth of 8% has been recorded
 iskaa saaf matlab he ki desh kii aarthik sthiti saamaanya hone ke saath-saath ab arthvyavastha tej raftaar se daudane ke raste par pahunch gai he

 In the first quarter growth figures, the manufacturing sector growth figures are not being supported by the GST collection during this period
 vahiin sarvice sector main darj hui single disit growth se nijee kshetra ke nivesh ko bal nahin miltaa
 Due to these two contradictions, it cannot be said on the basis of these figures that the country's economy has returned to track
 lihaaja, pehali timahi main 8
 a growth of 2 per cent is a good sign but cannot be considered a sign of the end of the current challenges in the economy

 Administrators are also here due to fans and cricketers, so the credibility of sports or board or even government is important, no matter what you do
 agar aapaki jindagi saarvajanik he to yah kaaphi ahm he
 "dravid said," This may reduce the respect and love for the cricketers and i think if it is to happen then it is really very sad for cricket in the country
 ’ek anya purv cricketer sanjay manjrekar ne kaha ki prashaasak is tarah ke sankat main uchit rup se pratikriya nahin dete hai kyonki ve jaanate hai ki prashansak kabhi bhi is khel se munh nahin pherenge, bhale hi kuch bhi ho jaye
 Manjrekar said, 'when the matter of match fixing came up in Indian cricket in 1999-2000, when some of the top Indian cricketers were banned, people thought that there would be a shock of credibility on Indian cricket and after that it would be at the lower level it will reach
 ’unhone kaha, ‘mujhe yaad he, is ghatana ke turant baad bharat-zimbabwe kii siries thi or stadium kii prayek seat bhar gayi thi
 That is why i think that administrators somewhere know that despite all this, people will remain obsessed with this game
 ’ manjrekar ne kaha, ‘kahin na kahin prashaskon ko lagata he ki ve isse batch sakate hai or mujhe lagata he ki isse bhartiya cricket ke prabandhan par dabaav banane main madad nahin milti
 But he also said, 'I think Indian fans love cricket unconditionally but for a long time administrators or BCCI cannot take advantage of it

 ' Once again the work of sealing the illegal trade establishments operating in the residential areas of Delhi has started, the shopkeepers are going on the protest for fear of losing employment and politics has started on it as usual
 jab tak todphod va ceiling shuru nahin hoti tab tak to nagar nigam va rajnatik dal ankhen munde rahete he lekin jab haahaakaar much jaataa he to sadak par utar janata ke liye qurbaan hone kaa naatak shuru ho jaataa he
 On December 15, 2017, the Supreme Court has re-appointed a three-member monitoring committee under the chairmanship of former Election Commission advisor KG Rao to oversee the sealing action, if presently, the Union Urban Development Ministry and the Municipal Corporations of Delhi have appointed the Supreme Court
 Had it put the appropriate party before it and taken necessary action, the Supreme Court in the year 2012 ended the monitoring committee Not Erjeevit
 12 janvari 2018 ko is maamle kii agali sunwaayee hogi, yadi dillivaasiyon ko ceiling se raahat deni he to kendriya shahari vikaas mantralay va dilli kii nagar nigamon ko supreme court main thos prastaav prastut karnaa hoga
 Although action is being taken only at commercial shops operating in residential areas without giving a conversion charge but there are signs of taking cognizance against other illegal constructions

 Despite the vigilance of the courts, illegal constructions are continuously happening all over Delhi, the action representative seems to be in a tizzy, in such a case, the Delhi High Court can give instructions for demolition against the listed about two lakh and currently ongoing illegal constructions
 emsidi main bijepi ke purv parshad jagadish mamagai ne bhi isse sawaal uthaae hai ki aakhir kyon jab bhukh lagati he tab kohda ropane sab chal dete he
 Fear of the law was abolished due to non-action of the persons responsible for the rampant illegal construction in Delhi
 durbhaagya kii baat yah he ki dilli main nirmit kareeb 44 lakh awasaiya va vyavsaayik ikaiyon main se keval do lakh ke hi nakshe paarit (sweekrut) hai
 Illegal construction took place on such a large scale and why no action was taken against anyone
 haalanki april 2006 main dilli hai court ne avaidh nirmaan ke liye jimmedaar adhikariyon kii sibiaijanch kar karrwai karne ke aadeshdie the par samay ke saath chalate jaanch thande baste dal gai
 Roads and footpaths are also being occupied, walking of common people has become difficult

 The Supreme Court continued to warn the corporations against the illegal construction and action against the establishments, failing which the Supreme Court has to reappoint the monitoring committee to direct the sealing action

 The Maharashtra government has directed the Director General of Police Pravin Dixit to submit a fresh report regarding the alleged laxity of Raigad police in the Sheena Bora murder case and is 'dissatisfied' with the 'one page' report submitted by former DGP Sanjeev Dayal
 rajya sarkaar ne yah jaanch karne kaa aadesh diya he ki 23 may, 2012 ko jab maharashtra main raigarh jile ke pen taluka ke jangalon main shina bora kaa shav pehali baar mila to police ne koi praathmiki yaa ediaar (aakasmik maut report) kyon nahin darj kii

 Bakshi said, the new DG (praveen Dixit) has now been entrusted with the responsibility of submitting a new report along with the relevant documents

 Meanwhile, denying media reports regarding the alleged involvement of a senior police officer in delaying investigation into the Sheena Bora murder case, Bakshi had earlier said that the government had not received any official communication from the CBI on the issue

 Even before its release from the film, it has been in constant controversy
 khabaron kii maane to isaki star cast main shamilsonu sutub film kaa hissaa nahin hai
 The reason for the exit of Sonu Kemnikarnika is being told about the differences with the directors of the film and their preoccupation with the film Simba
 film kii mukhya abhinetrikangana ranautane khud is baat kaa khulaasa kiya he
 Kangana said- "I have not met Sonu Sood since the shoot at the end of last year
 vesimbafilm kii shooting main vyast hai
 Even he could not give dates for the shooting of the film by keeping pace with the rest of the cast
 unhone kaam karne se inkaar kar diya
 Sonu is my friend and on his request i also launched the music of one of his films which was produced by him
 sonu ke paas film ke liye dats nahin thi
 Also Kangana has also said that Sonu does not want to work with women directors
 kangana ne aage kaha- jab maine unase pichhali baar baat kii unhone mujhe koi doosraa actor talashne kaa suzav diya
 After this, when i read the script of the film to Zeeshan Job, he agreed to work in it, but he gave a date till September
 tab tak kaaphi der ho jaati
 When Kangana was asked whether the portion of the film that Sonu acted in would be retained, Kangana's answer was "no"
 unke dwaara kiye gaye shoot ko film main shaamil nahin kiya jayega
 Those scenes will be shot again
 ''iske alaava kangana ne is baat kaa bhi khulaasa kiya ki ''sonune film main kuch seens khud likhe the
 These scenes were on the field
 wo chaahate the ki unke dwaara likhe seens ko film main liya jaaai magar nirmaataaon ne aisa karne se manaa kar diya
 Sonu was building a body for this for the last 4 months
 mujhe is bare main nahin pataa tha
 Neither am i the director of the film
 un seens ko film main naa lene kaa faisla nirdeshkon ne liya
 "apart from this, on the inclusion of his name in the directors of the film, Kangana said-" i never asked anyone to include my name in it
 main sirf manikarnika kii daasi hum
 i am doing this only for them
 maine hameshaa ye baat saaf taur par kahi he

 Electricity can become one-third more expensive from next month across the country
 bijli vitaran companiyaan eendhan ke badhate kharch or nuksaan kaa kuch boj apane graahakon par daalana chaahati hai
 They have approached the regulators for this
 mumbai main kuch upabhoktaaon ko 11 rupee prati unit kii dar se bijli bill chukaane ke liye kaha ja saktaa he
 In Andhra Pradesh, those consuming more than 500 units may have to pay a tariff of Rs 7
 teriff badhaane ke prastaav se dilli, punjab or rajasthan jaise rajyon ke upabhoktaaon ko doharaa jhatka lagegaa kyon ki in rajyon main pichley 10 maheenon main bijli daron main kaaphi badhotaree hui he
 The proposal to increase tariff will give a double blow to the consumers of states like Delhi, Punjab and Rajasthan as electricity rates in these states have increased significantly in the last 10 months
 kabhi class ke pehle din se to kabhi class ke baahar panishment main khadey hokar yaa phir takaraar ke baad, dosti kabhi bhi or kisi bhi sthiti main shuru ho jaaya karti thi
 Such were the days of school and childhood friends
 ek hi desk par baithna or saath main lunch karne se leki washroom tak saath main janaa bachapan kii dosti ko or majboot bana detaa he
 The extent of love in childhood friends used to be that if one fell ill, the other would also get sick in his memory
 aapako bhi yaad aa gaye na apane bachpan ke saathi
 Be it the competition of running time cycling back from school or eating ice cream and chubby after saving money, every single moment spent with friends was not less than a film story
 khelnaa-kudane se lekar shaitaniyaan karne tak doston ke saath to teacher kii daant khaanaa or mummy kii pitayee sab acha lagata tha
 How lovely was Vodosti and such good childhood days
 aaj bhi usamen se kuch dost saath hai jo samay-samay par dosti kii us saundhi khooshbu ko yaad dilaate rahete hai
 As they grew up, this color of friendship also became darker
 haa ye baat jarur he ki college or offis main kuch or achche dost bane lekin bachapan ke wo dost or unki dosti kii to baat hi kuch or he
 That is why whenever we get time, we have to leave our city to remember our old days and to cherish the memories of our friendship in every street corner
 agar aap bhi apane bachapan ke doston ko bahut miss karte hai to kyon unke liye time nikaalen or unke saath milakar apnidosti ko celibratakaren kyonki bachapan ke dost baar-baar nahin milte

 The police first arrested 5 people and then last week, Punjab's State Operation Cell arrested the brother of Gurmeet Singh alias Bagga alias Doctor sitting in Germany from Jalandhar
 police ke mutabik, kashmir main hathiyaar nahin pahunchaae jane kii evaj main aatankiyon ko dilli yaa punjab main bade hamale kaa aadesh tha
 If your boyfriend or boyfriend tells you that he has not said i love you to anyone other than you and never says it, then it can also be a lie
 haal main ai ek study ke mutabik, ek shaks apni jindagi mentin logon ko ai lav you kahata he
 According to the yougov survey, when a thousand people were surveyed in America, these facts came out
 study main kaha gaya he ki amuman ek shaks apni jindagi main teen se adhik rishton main nahin padataa he
 These are long lasting relationships
 haalanki study main ye bhi spasht nahin bataaya gaya he ki ye rishte kitne lambey samay tak chalate hai or ye kitne gambhir hote hai
 But it has been said in the study that usually one person calls these three people as magical words
 internet survey par kareeb 1000 america logon se sawaal kiye gaye
 They were all between 18 and 65 years old
 in sabhi se apane anubhavon ke aadhaar par ye bataane ke liye kaha gaya ki unhonein teen khubasurat shabdon kaa istemaalakitne logon ke saath kiya he

 15 percent of the people said that they have fallen in love thrice
 haalanki survey main aisi kai bate hai jinaki pramanikta sabit nahin ho paati he or saath hi ye bhi pataa nahin chalata he ki unhone jin logon se ai lav you kaha wo kis bhav se kaha
 This step of the Election Commission has been termed by Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee as BJP pressure
 unhone bengal maamle par samarthan karne ke liye baaki dalon ke netaaon ko dhanyavad diya or kaha, 'mayawati, akhilesh yadav, congress, chandrababu naidu or baaki sabhi logon ko hamaara or bengal ke logon kaa samarthan karne ke liye dhanyavad
 The biased decision taken by the Election Commission under pressure from BJP is a direct attack on democracy
 janata iskaa munhtod jawaab degi
 'the campaigning call off by EC in Bengal is against the democratic spirit of free and fair elections
 EC is behaving like BJP cell
 We fully support @mamataofficial ji in this fight
 unhone kaha, ‘guru or chele jis tarah haath dhokar mamata banerjee or unki party ke peeche pade hai vah ek khatarnaak pravriti he jo uchit va nyaaysangat nahin he
 The way Mamata Banerjee and her government are being tried to discredit it does not suit the Prime Minister of the country
 'saath hi basapa pramukh ne kaha, ‘isse bhi zyada dukh kii baat yah he ki centre sarkaar ke dabaav main mukhya chunaav ayog ne pashchim bengal main ek din pehle hi chunaav prachaar par roak laga di or vah bhi aaj pradhanmantri kii do reliyaan vahaan khatm hone ke baad raat das baje se
 
 
 Our party strongly condemns this
 ' unhone kaha ki agar prachaar par roak lagaani hi thi to aaj subah se lagaani chahie thi
 It is clear from this that the Lok Sabha election this time is not completely free and fair with the current Chief Election Commissioner

 i will buy my house, but the person inside me will always be like this
 main nahin chaahati ki log kahen ki main safalataa paane se badal gai
