khumbhu glacier kii dhalaan par barf kii safed chadar dekhte hi dekhte kai jagah se fatne lagi
 Solid snow began to sink under the feet
 koi bhi him daraar parvatarohiyon ko nigal sakati thi
 It took both speed and patience to get out of the midst of this white death on the way
 tabhi upar se barf kaa toofaan guzara
 
 
 
 aamir ne bataaya, jab ham neeche bhaag rahe the to neeche bhaagane ke saath barf kaa tufaan aayaa, jisaki vajah se hamen neeche baithna padaa or hamane apana munh dhakaa
 When we opened our eyes after five minutes, we had five to ten inches of snow
 ab ham neeche bhaag-bhaag ke aae, jab ham base camp par pahunche, vahaan par hamaare rakesh solanki sar the, jinhone base camp ko cover kiya
 The avalanche that took place at the base camp landed and landed at the base camp
 
 
 aamir ne kaha, hamen do minute ke liye laga jaise ham aankh band karke maut kaa intazaar kar rahe the
 When you are standing on the Khumbu Glacier and there are rocks of snow falling around you and the glacier you are standing on is also shaking, then you can imagine how close we have seen to death
 bhartiya sena main major jamwaal ne bataaya, jab ham neeche pahunche to hamane dekha sab safaa he
 there's nothing left
 hamaara khud kaa kuch nahin bachaa tha
 We have HRA on our side, Casualties started frequenting there
 everest base camp par chaaron ore cheekh pukaar machi thi
 Rakesh Solanki told, We were seven to eight people down
 tabhi qareeb 12:40 par arthquek aa gaya
 As we got out of the tent and were watching, i started shooting out by taking out the camera that in that way a mountain of snow was broken very near to us and it started coming towards us
 ham usee vaqt camera vahiin chhodkar apni jaan bachaane ke liye daude
 i found a small rock
 uske peeche main baith gaya
 i and a Sherpa survived there
 hamaare upar puraa tents aakar gir gaya, isi vajah se hamaara shelter ho gaya or ham batch gaye
 As soon as that was over, we immediately took out the camera
 shoot karnaa start kiya tha to dekha sab tabah ho chukaa tha or base camp main bahut hi bure haal the
 Many people were injured, around 22 people were killed due to head injuries
 major jamwaal ne bataaya ki kisi ne ye expect nahin kiya tha ki base camp ke andar vah bhi pumori se aisa himaskhalan hoga, jo base camp ko uda ke le jayega
 After this, Mount Everest Base Camp was scattered
 parvatarohiyon ke tambu barf ke toofaan main ujaad chuke the
 Everything from food to drink to mountaineering was buried in ice somewhere hundreds of meters away
 phir ghayalon ke aane kaa silsilaa shuru hua
 The expedition team of the Indian Army immediately engaged in relief and rescue
 major jamwaal ne bataaya, hamane apane aapako do tiimon main baanta
 i made a doctor's team
 uske saath aath bande baante
 
 
 And i engaged the rest of the team to find our luggage, which was very important, because our everything had flown
 darasal, toofaan main bikhri chizein jutanaa zaruri tha
 These goods were the door to keep the lives alive there
 ghayalon kaa ilaaj bhi tabhi ho paata
 The army team collected everything one by one
 nae sire se tambu lagaae gaye
 The field hospital of the Indian Army was started shortly
 major jamwaal ke mutabik, davaaiyaan hamaare paas bahut thi
 We had more medicines than HRA
 hamaare paas bahut kaabil doctor the or unhone bahut help kii
 Our doctor was with the injured all night
 vah sir kii choton kaa department sambhaal rahe the, jo ek main department tha, kyonki adhiktar parvatarohiyon ko sir par chot lagi thi
 The snowstorm that he brought by breaking rocks and stones
 iske baad helicopteron ke jariye jin parvatarohiyon ko gambhir chotein ain, unhen turant rajdhani kathmandu yaa sabase qareeb lukala ke aspataal bhejne kaa kaam shuru hua
 After the avalanche, many Sherpas at the base camp left their teams and withdrew
 isaki do vajah raheen
 One is that out of the 22 climbers killed in the avalanche, 16 were Sherpas and the other was the devastation in Nepal in which many houses were broken
 aamir ne bataaya ki uske baad jab ham neeche aae to neeche utarate hi jitne bhi sherpa the, saare ke saare sherpa base camp chhodkar nikalne lage, kyonki pichley saal himaskhalan main 16 sherpa kii mautein huin thim
 The same thing happened this year
 19 main se 16 sherpa the
 When all the Sherpas started running, only the climbers were left
 parvatarohiyon ko utani jaankaree nahin hoti
 Meanwhile, many foreign mountaineer teams have still not returned to the base camp, which climbers had climbed towards Everest a couple of days before, all were waiting for them
 everest kaa base camp, camp van camp tu se cat chukaa tha
 Everyone was in a hurry to return, if not the Indian Army expedition
 aamir ne bataaya ki bhartiya sena ne yahaan great role nibhaayaa
 They could also leave, but did not leave, because those who were trapped there, it was necessary to find relief by finding them first, because no one had any food and drink left
 sirf indian army ke paas jo khaanaa bachaa tha vah baanta gaya
 The Indian Army front with some foreign climbers at the base camp
 everest base camp par zindagi kii jang jari thi
 Those who survived the snow storm landed at Everest Base Camp, thanking God
 is bich ek ke baad ek aa rahe chote bukamp rah rahakar sabko daraa rahe the
 With the earthquake, everyone's eyes would go to the higher peaks to see if death was coming down in the shape of snow storm
 major jamwaal ne bataaya, hamane santari duty par lagaae hue hai
 If there is such a voice, on all three sides, you can talk about Pomori, you can talk about Lola or Nubsey, which way Avalansh will come, these boys will warn us
 pehla din jaise-taise guzara
 The next morning, the work of evacuating the survivors resumed
 is bich dopaher main ek or bada bukamp sabko dahala gaya
 After the earth, it was now the turn of the sky
 base camp ko badalon ne gher liya or barfabaari shuru ho gai
 Aamir told that it was snowing continuously
 har din or raat ko traders aa rahe the
 The Indian Army employed three sentries, who lived around the camp overnight
 jyon hi avalanche kii awaz aa rahi hoti to ve hamen chilla ke bolte the, baahar niklo
 
 
 So we used to find shelter
 pathar ke saamne jhuk jate the
 The comments dhire-dhire base camp par bachi tiimon ne apana abhiyaan sametanaa shuru kiya, lekin bhartiya sena kaa abhiyaan dal base camp par raahat or bachaav ke kaam main ab bhi juta tha
 Meanwhile, the time has come for our return from base camp
 bhare man ke saath hamane vahaan maujuud saathiyon se vidaa lee
 That dark memory of Everest Base Camp on April 25, 2015 will always be fresh in the mind, but we will return with a new spirit, a new place, a new height
 
 
 enditivi ke aamir rafique ne bataaya ki abhi ham everest base camp par bhartiya sena ke 30 logon ke saath the
 We went to Base Camp-1 only
 jab ham waapas aa rahe the, itane main khumbhu glacier, jo sabase dangeras world main maane jate hai, ve hilne lage
 There was an avalanche from both our left and right sides and the entire army team which was under the leadership of Major Jamwal said that you hold the rope and stay down
 ham do minute tak rahe or kuch der intjaar karte rahe
 
 
 
 abhi ham marane vaale hai
 
 
 Then someone said, run away
 
 
 
 On seeing the white sheet of ice on the slope of Khumbu Glacier, it started bursting from many places
 pairon ke neeche thos barf dhansane lagi
 Any snow crack could swallow the climbers
 raste main bichhi is safed maut ke bich se nikalne ke liye tezi or sabar donon kii zarurat thi
 That's when the snowstorm passed from above
 
 
 
 Aamir told, when we were running down, a snow storm came with the run down, due to which we had to sit down and we covered our mouths
 jab hamane paanch minute ke baad apni ankhen kholin to hamaare upar paanch se das inch tak barf jamaa thi
 Now we came downstairs, when we reached the base camp, there was our Rakesh Solanki sir, who covered the base camp
 base camp main jo upar se himaskhalan hua tha, vah utarkar base camp par aa gaya
 
 
 Aamir said, for two minutes we felt like we were waiting for death with our eyes closed
 khumbhu glacier par jab aap khadey hon or aapke chaaron ore se barf kii chattaane gir rahi hon or aap jis glacier par khadey hon, vah bhi hill rahaa he to aap soch sakate hai hamane maut ko kitne qareeb se dekha he
 Major Jamwal in the Indian Army said, when we reached the bottom, we saw everything was safe
 kuch nahin bachaa he
 We had nothing left of ourselves
 hamaari bagal main echaare he, vahaan par cazmultiz lagaataar aani shuru ho gai thim
 There was a scream around Everest Base Camp
 rakesh solanki ne bataaya, ham saat se aath log neeche the
 Then at around 12:40 Earthquake arrived
 jaise ham log baahar tent se nikle or dekh hi rahe the, maine camera nikaal kar shooting karnaa shuru hi kiya tha ki utane main hamaare saamne bahut nazadik puraa barf kaa ek pahaad tut chukaa tha or vah hamaari taraf aane laga
 We left the camera right then and ran to save our lives
 mujhe ek choti-si chattan mil gai
 i sat behind him
 vahaan par main or ek sherpa bache
 The whole tent came and fell on us, that is why our shelter was done and we were saved
 vah sab jaise hi khatm hua to turant hamane camera nikaala
 When i started shooting, i saw everything was destroyed and the base camp was in very bad condition
 bahut zyada log ghayal hue the, sir kii choton se qareeb 22 log maare ja chuke the
 Major Jamwal said that no one had expected that inside the base camp, that too would be an avalanche from Pumori that would blow up the base camp
 iske baad mount everest base camp bikharaa padaa tha
 The climbers' tents were devastated by the snowstorm
 khaane-pine se lekar parvatarohan tak kaa saamaan saikadon meter dur kahin barf main dab chukaa tha
 Then the process of the arrival of the injured started
 bhartiya sena kaa abhiyaan dal turant raahat or bachaav main jute gaya
 Major Jamwal told that, we divided ourselves into two teams
 maine ek doctor kii team banaai
 He shared eight men with him
 
 
 or baaki team ko maine apana saamaan dhundne ke liye lagaaya, jo ki bahut jaruri tha, kyonki hamaara sab kuch ud chukaa tha
 Actually, it was necessary to collect scattered things in the storm
 ye saamaan vahaan maujuud jidangiyon ko bachaae rakhane kii door tha
 Only the injured could be treated
 sena kii team ne ek-ek kar sab jutaya
 Tents were renovated
 kuch hi der main bhartiya sena kaa field hospital shuru ho gaya tha
 According to Major Jamwal, we had a lot of medicines
 echaare se bhi zyaada davaaiyaan hamaare paas thi
 We had very capable doctors and they helped a lot
 puri raat hamaara doctor ghayalon saath rahaa
 He was handling the head injuries department, which was a main department, as most of the climbers suffered head injuries
 barf kaa toofaan apane saath chattaane or pathar todakar jo laayaa tha
 After this, the work of sending climbers who received serious injuries through helicopters immediately sent them to the capital Kathmandu or the nearest hospital in Lukla
 himaskhalan ke baad base camp par maujuud kai sherpa apni tiimon ko chhodkar waapas nikal gaye
 There were two reasons for this
 ek to ye ki himaskhalan main maare gaye 22 parvatarohiyon main se 16 sherpa the or doosraa nepal main ai tabaahi main kaiyon ke ghar afat tut padi thi
 Aamir told that after that when we came down, all the Sherpas were leaving the base camp as soon as we came down, because last year there were 16 Sherpa deaths in the avalanche
 is saal bhi vahi hua
 16 out of 19 were Sherpas
 saare ke saare sherpa jab bhaagane lage to saare parvatarohi hi bache rah gaye
 Climbers don't know that much
 is bich kai videshi parvatarohiyon kii timen ab bhi base camp par nahin lauti thim, jo parvatarohi ek do din pehle hi everest kii ore chadhaai kar chuke the, sabko unka intazaar tha
 Everest's base camp was cut from Camp One Camp Two
 sabko waapas lautne kii jaldi thi, nahin thi to sirf bhartiya sena ke abhiyaan dal ko
 Aamir told that the Indian Army played a great role here
 ve bhi nikal sakate the, lekin nahin nikle, kyonki vahaan par jo log fanse hue the, pehle unhen dhundhakar kar raahat pahunchnaa jaruri tha, kyonki kisi ke paas koi khaanaa-pinaa nahin bachaa tha
 Only the food that was left with the Indian Army was distributed
 base camp par kuch videshi parvatarohiyon ke saath bhartiya sena morcha sanbhale rahi
 The war of life continued at Everest Base Camp
 everest base camp par utre barf ke toofaan main jo batch gaye wo bhagwaan kaa shukriya adaa kar rahe the
 Meanwhile, small earthquakes coming one after the other were frightening everyone
 bukamp ke saath hi sabaki nigaah oonchi chotiyon par chali jaati ye dekhne ke liye ki kahin phir maut barf ke toofaan kii shakl main neeche to nahin utar rahi
 Major Jamwal told, we are on sentry duty
 agar koi aisi awaz aati he, teenon taraf, aap pomori kii baat kar sakate hai, lola kii baat kar sakate hai yaa nubse kii, jis taraf se bhi avalanche aayega, ye ladke hamen saavdhaan karenge
 The first day passed as usual
 agali subah bache hue logon ko nikaalane kaa kaam phir shuru hua
 Meanwhile, in the afternoon another big earthquake shook everyone
 dharti ke baad ab aasmaan kii baari thi
 The base camp was surrounded by clouds and snowfall started
 aamir ne bataaya ki lagaataar barfbaari ho rahi tha
 Tremors were coming in every day and night
 bhartiya sena teen santariyon ko lagaakar rakhti thi, jo raat bhar camp ke aasapaas rahete the
 As soon as the voice of Evlansh was coming, they used to shout at us, get out
 
 
 to ham shelter dhundte the
 Used to bow in front of the stone
 tippaniyan Gradually, the remaining teams at the base camp began to consolidate their operations, but the Indian Army expedition was still engaged in relief and rescue work at the base camp
 is bich base camp se hamaare lautne kaa vaqt bhi aa gaya
 With good heart, we bid farewell to the colleagues present there
 25 april, 2015 ko everest base camp kii wo syah yaad hameshaa dimaag main tazaa rahegi, lekin ham lautenge ek nae haunsale ke saath, ek nayaa mukaam, ek nai oonchai hasil karne ke liye

 Major Jamwal said that no one had expected that inside the base camp, that too would be an avalanche from Pumori that would blow up the base camp
 iske baad mount everest base camp bikharaa padaa tha
 The climbers' tents were devastated by the snowstorm
 khaane-pine se lekar parvatarohan tak kaa saamaan saikadon meter dur kahin barf main dab chukaa tha
 Then the process of the arrival of the injured started
 bhartiya sena kaa abhiyaan dal turant raahat or bachaav main jute gaya
 Major Jamwal told that, we divided ourselves into two teams
 maine ek doctor kii team banaai
 He shared eight men with him

 Only the injured could be treated

 We had very capable doctors and they helped a lot
 puri raat hamaara doctor ghayalon saath rahaa
 He was handling the head injuries department, which was a main department, as most of the climbers suffered head injuries
 barf kaa toofaan apane saath chattaane or pathar todakar jo laayaa tha
 After this, the work of sending climbers who received serious injuries through helicopters immediately sent them to the capital Kathmandu or the nearest hospital in Lukla
 himaskhalan ke baad base camp par maujuud kai sherpa apni tiimon ko chhodkar waapas nikal gaye
 There were two reasons for this
 ek to ye ki himaskhalan main maare gaye 22 parvatarohiyon main se 16 sherpa the or doosraa nepal main ai tabaahi main kaiyon ke ghar afat tut padi thi
 Aamir told that after that when we came down, all the Sherpas were leaving the base camp as soon as we came down, because last year there were 16 Sherpa deaths in the avalanche
 is saal bhi vahi hua
 16 out of 19 were Sherpas
 saare ke saare sherpa jab bhaagane lage to saare parvatarohi hi bache rah gaye
 Climbers don't know that much
 is bich kai videshi parvatarohiyon kii timen ab bhi base camp par nahin lauti thim, jo parvatarohi ek do din pehle hi everest kii ore chadhaai kar chuke the, sabko unka intazaar tha
 Everest's base camp was cut from Camp One Camp Two
 sabko waapas lautne kii jaldi thi, nahin thi to sirf bhartiya sena ke abhiyaan dal ko
 Aamir told that the Indian Army played a great role here
 ve bhi nikal sakate the, lekin nahin nikle, kyonki vahaan par jo log fanse hue the, pehle unhen dhundhakar kar raahat pahunchnaa jaruri tha, kyonki kisi ke paas koi khaanaa-pinaa nahin bachaa tha
 Only the food that was left with the Indian Army was distributed
 base camp par kuch videshi parvatarohiyon ke saath bhartiya sena morcha sanbhale rahi
 The war of life continued at Everest Base Camp
 everest base camp par utre barf ke toofaan main jo batch gaye wo bhagwaan kaa shukriya adaa kar rahe the
 Meanwhile, small earthquakes coming one after the other were frightening everyone
 bukamp ke saath hi sabaki nigaah oonchi chotiyon par chali jaati ye dekhne ke liye ki kahin phir maut barf ke toofaan kii shakl main neeche to nahin utar rahi
 Major Jamwal told, we are on sentry duty
 agar koi aisi awaz aati he, teenon taraf, aap pomori kii baat kar sakate hai, lola kii baat kar sakate hai yaa nubse kii, jis taraf se bhi avalanche aayega, ye ladke hamen saavdhaan karenge
 The first day passed as usual
 agali subah bache hue logon ko nikaalane kaa kaam phir shuru hua
 Meanwhile, in the afternoon another big earthquake shook everyone
 dharti ke baad ab aasmaan kii baari thi
 The base camp was surrounded by clouds and snowfall started
 aamir ne bataaya ki lagaataar barfbaari ho rahi tha
 Tremors were coming in every day and night
 bhartiya sena teen santariyon ko lagaakar rakhti thi, jo raat bhar camp ke aasapaas rahete the
 As soon as the voice of Evlansh was coming, they used to shout at us, get out
 
 
 to ham shelter dhundte the
 Used to bow in front of the stone
 tippaniyan Gradually, the remaining teams at the base camp began to consolidate their operations, but the Indian Army expedition was still engaged in relief and rescue work at the base camp
 is bich base camp se hamaare lautne kaa vaqt bhi aa gaya
 With good heart, we bid farewell to the colleagues present there
 25 april, 2015 ko everest base camp kii wo syah yaad hameshaa dimaag main tazaa rahegi, lekin ham lautenge ek nae haunsale ke saath, ek nayaa mukaam, ek nai oonchai hasil karne ke liye
 
 
 Rakesh Solanki told, We were seven to eight people down
 tabhi qareeb 12:40 par arthquek aa gaya
 As we got out of the tent and were watching, i started shooting out by taking out the camera that in that way a mountain of snow was broken very near to us and it started coming towards us
 ham usee vaqt camera vahiin chhodkar apni jaan bachaane ke liye daude
 i found a small rock
 uske peeche main baith gaya
 i and a Sherpa survived there
 hamaare upar puraa tents aakar gir gaya, isi vajah se hamaara shelter ho gaya or ham batch gaye
 As soon as that was over, we immediately took out the camera
 shoot karnaa start kiya tha to dekha sab tabah ho chukaa tha or base camp main bahut hi bure haal the
 Many people were injured, around 22 people were killed due to head injuries
 major jamwaal ne bataaya ki kisi ne ye expect nahin kiya tha ki base camp ke andar vah bhi pumori se aisa himaskhalan hoga, jo base camp ko uda ke le jayega
 After this, Mount Everest Base Camp was scattered
 parvatarohiyon ke tambu barf ke toofaan main ujaad chuke the
 Everything from food to drink to mountaineering was buried in ice somewhere hundreds of meters away
 phir ghayalon ke aane kaa silsilaa shuru hua
 The expedition team of the Indian Army immediately engaged in relief and rescue
 major jamwaal ne bataaya, hamane apane aapako do tiimon main baanta
 i made a doctor's team
 uske saath aath bande baante
 
 
 And i engaged the rest of the team to find our luggage, which was very important, because our everything had flown
 darasal, toofaan main bikhri chizein jutanaa zaruri tha
 These goods were the door to keep the lives alive there
 ghayalon kaa ilaaj bhi tabhi ho paata
 The army team collected everything one by one
 nae sire se tambu lagaae gaye
 The field hospital of the Indian Army was started shortly
 major jamwaal ke mutabik, davaaiyaan hamaare paas bahut thi
 We had more medicines than HRA
 hamaare paas bahut kaabil doctor the or unhone bahut help kii
 Our doctor was with the injured all night
 vah sir kii choton kaa department sambhaal rahe the, jo ek main department tha, kyonki adhiktar parvatarohiyon ko sir par chot lagi thi
 The snowstorm that he brought by breaking rocks and stones
 iske baad helicopteron ke jariye jin parvatarohiyon ko gambhir chotein ain, unhen turant rajdhani kathmandu yaa sabase qareeb lukala ke aspataal bhejne kaa kaam shuru hua
 After the avalanche, many Sherpas at the base camp left their teams and withdrew
 isaki do vajah raheen
 One is that out of the 22 climbers killed in the avalanche, 16 were Sherpas and the other was the devastation in Nepal in which many houses were broken
 aamir ne bataaya ki uske baad jab ham neeche aae to neeche utarate hi jitne bhi sherpa the, saare ke saare sherpa base camp chhodkar nikalne lage, kyonki pichley saal himaskhalan main 16 sherpa kii mautein huin thim
 The same thing happened this year
 19 main se 16 sherpa the
 When all the Sherpas started running, only the climbers were left
 parvatarohiyon ko utani jaankaree nahin hoti
 Meanwhile, many foreign mountaineer teams have still not returned to the base camp, which climbers had climbed towards Everest a couple of days before, all were waiting for them
 everest kaa base camp, camp van camp tu se cat chukaa tha
 Everyone was in a hurry to return, if not the Indian Army expedition
 aamir ne bataaya ki bhartiya sena ne yahaan great role nibhaayaa
 They could also leave, but did not leave, because those who were trapped there, it was necessary to find relief by finding them first, because no one had any food and drink left
 sirf indian army ke paas jo khaanaa bachaa tha vah baanta gaya
 The Indian Army front with some foreign climbers at the base camp
 everest base camp par zindagi kii jang jari thi
 Those who survived the snow storm landed at Everest Base Camp, thanking God
 is bich ek ke baad ek aa rahe chote bukamp rah rahakar sabko daraa rahe the
 With the earthquake, everyone's eyes would go to the higher peaks to see if death was coming down in the shape of snow storm
 major jamwaal ne bataaya, hamane santari duty par lagaae hue hai
 If there is such a voice, on all three sides, you can talk about Pomori, you can talk about Lola or Nubsey, which way Avalansh will come, these boys will warn us
 pehla din jaise-taise guzara
 The next morning, the work of evacuating the survivors resumed
 is bich dopaher main ek or bada bukamp sabko dahala gaya
 After the earth, it was now the turn of the sky
 base camp ko badalon ne gher liya or barfabaari shuru ho gai
 Aamir told that it was snowing continuously
 har din or raat ko traders aa rahe the
 The Indian Army employed three sentries, who lived around the camp overnight
 jyon hi avalanche kii awaz aa rahi hoti to ve hamen chilla ke bolte the, baahar niklo
 
 
 So we used to find shelter
 pathar ke saamne jhuk jate the
 The comments dhire-dhire base camp par bachi tiimon ne apana abhiyaan sametanaa shuru kiya, lekin bhartiya sena kaa abhiyaan dal base camp par raahat or bachaav ke kaam main ab bhi juta tha
 Meanwhile, the time has come for our return from base camp
 bhare man ke saath hamane vahaan maujuud saathiyon se vidaa lee
 That dark memory of Everest Base Camp on April 25, 2015 will always be fresh in the mind, but we will return with a new spirit, a new place, a new height
 
 
 mujhe ek choti-si chattan mil gai
 i sat behind him
 vahaan par main or ek sherpa bache
 The whole tent came and fell on us, that is why our shelter was done and we were saved
 vah sab jaise hi khatm hua to turant hamane camera nikaala
 When i started shooting, i saw everything was destroyed and the base camp was in very bad condition
 bahut zyada log ghayal hue the, sir kii choton se qareeb 22 log maare ja chuke the

 According to Major Jamwal, we had a lot of medicines
 echaare se bhi zyaada davaaiyaan hamaare paas thi
 We had very capable doctors and they helped a lot
 puri raat hamaara doctor ghayalon saath rahaa
 He was handling the head injuries department, which was a main department, as most of the climbers suffered head injuries
 barf kaa toofaan apane saath chattaane or pathar todakar jo laayaa tha
 After this, the work of sending climbers who received serious injuries through helicopters immediately sent them to the capital Kathmandu or the nearest hospital in Lukla
 himaskhalan ke baad base camp par maujuud kai sherpa apni tiimon ko chhodkar waapas nikal gaye
 There were two reasons for this

 Aamir told that after that when we came down, all the Sherpas were leaving the base camp as soon as we came down, because last year there were 16 Sherpa deaths in the avalanche
 is saal bhi vahi hua
 16 out of 19 were Sherpas
 saare ke saare sherpa jab bhaagane lage to saare parvatarohi hi bache rah gaye
 Climbers don't know that much

 Everest's base camp was cut from Camp One Camp Two

 Aamir told that the Indian Army played a great role here
 ve bhi nikal sakate the, lekin nahin nikle, kyonki vahaan par jo log fanse hue the, pehle unhen dhundhakar kar raahat pahunchnaa jaruri tha, kyonki kisi ke paas koi khaanaa-pinaa nahin bachaa tha
 Only the food that was left with the Indian Army was distributed
 base camp par kuch videshi parvatarohiyon ke saath bhartiya sena morcha sanbhale rahi
 The war of life continued at Everest Base Camp
 everest base camp par utre barf ke toofaan main jo batch gaye wo bhagwaan kaa shukriya adaa kar rahe the
 Meanwhile, small earthquakes coming one after the other were frightening everyone
 bukamp ke saath hi sabaki nigaah oonchi chotiyon par chali jaati ye dekhne ke liye ki kahin phir maut barf ke toofaan kii shakl main neeche to nahin utar rahi
 Major Jamwal told, we are on sentry duty
 agar koi aisi awaz aati he, teenon taraf, aap pomori kii baat kar sakate hai, lola kii baat kar sakate hai yaa nubse kii, jis taraf se bhi avalanche aayega, ye ladke hamen saavdhaan karenge
 The first day passed as usual

 Meanwhile, in the afternoon another big earthquake shook everyone
 dharti ke baad ab aasmaan kii baari thi
 The base camp was surrounded by clouds and snowfall started
 aamir ne bataaya ki lagaataar barfbaari ho rahi tha
 Tremors were coming in every day and night
 bhartiya sena teen santariyon ko lagaakar rakhti thi, jo raat bhar camp ke aasapaas rahete the
 As soon as the voice of Evlansh was coming, they used to shout at us, get out

 After the avalanche, many Sherpas at the base camp left their teams and withdrew
 isaki do vajah raheen
 One is that out of the 22 climbers killed in the avalanche, 16 were Sherpas and the other was the devastation in Nepal in which many houses were broken
 aamir ne bataaya ki uske baad jab ham neeche aae to neeche utarate hi jitne bhi sherpa the, saare ke saare sherpa base camp chhodkar nikalne lage, kyonki pichley saal himaskhalan main 16 sherpa kii mautein huin thim
 The same thing happened this year
 19 main se 16 sherpa the
 When all the Sherpas started running, only the climbers were left
 parvatarohiyon ko utani jaankaree nahin hoti
 Meanwhile, many foreign mountaineer teams have still not returned to the base camp, which climbers had climbed towards Everest a couple of days before, all were waiting for them
 everest kaa base camp, camp van camp tu se cat chukaa tha
 Everyone was in a hurry to return, if not the Indian Army expedition
 aamir ne bataaya ki bhartiya sena ne yahaan great role nibhaayaa
 They could also leave, but did not leave, because those who were trapped there, it was necessary to find relief by finding them first, because no one had any food and drink left
 sirf indian army ke paas jo khaanaa bachaa tha vah baanta gaya
 The Indian Army front with some foreign climbers at the base camp
 everest base camp par zindagi kii jang jari thi
 Those who survived the snow storm landed at Everest Base Camp, thanking God

 With the earthquake, everyone's eyes would go to the higher peaks to see if death was coming down in the shape of snow storm

 If there is such a voice, on all three sides, you can talk about Pomori, you can talk about Lola or Nubsey, which way Avalansh will come, these boys will warn us
 pehla din jaise-taise guzara
 The next morning, the work of evacuating the survivors resumed

 After the earth, it was now the turn of the sky
 base camp ko badalon ne gher liya or barfabaari shuru ho gai
 Aamir told that it was snowing continuously

 The Indian Army employed three sentries, who lived around the camp overnight
 jyon hi avalanche kii awaz aa rahi hoti to ve hamen chilla ke bolte the, baahar niklo

 The comments dhire-dhire base camp par bachi tiimon ne apana abhiyaan sametanaa shuru kiya, lekin bhartiya sena kaa abhiyaan dal base camp par raahat or bachaav ke kaam main ab bhi juta tha

 1
 franklin ko mujeec kaa bahut shauk tha
 He could not live without listening to music

 Rubbing this musical instrument with wet hands produces a very good sound

 Hearing this, many American patriots began to feel that Franklin is not working for the freedom of America but for Britain
 3
 At the age of 22, he started his first company, The Pennsylvania Gadget
 yahi nahin, vah philadelphia se nikalne vaale ek samachar patr ke sampadak bhi the
 He also contributed significantly in establishing the University of Pennsylvania

 franklin ke paas do das the, jo unke gharelu kaam kaaj karte the
 The practice of keeping slaves in the aristocratic families of America was
 franklin ne apane jivan ke antim samay main apane donon daason ko mukt kar diya
 Not only this, he also placed a condition in front of his son and daughter-in-law that he would be entitled to his property only when he freed his slaves

 Meanwhile, Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni also said in Chandigarh that she was also unhappy about Anna's arrest and many Congressmen are suspicious about the opinion of Sandeep Dixit
 
 The situation is that Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, who saved the government on every front, has also started avoiding speaking anything on this issue
 jaahir he agar congress janata kii aawaaj ko dabaanaa bhi chaahe to use pehle party ke andar ho rahi sugabugahat se nipatna hoga
 The country is under threat from traitors: Anna Hazare | photodesi and Anna Hazare's supporters are not tolerating the statements of Congress leaders
 wo chun-chun kar un netaaon ke khilaaf pradarshan kar rahe hai, jinhone anna ke virodh main koi bayaan diya ho

 Anna's wave in the country is such that no one wants to hear a word against him and for the first time, the use of the words independence and Gandhi is also going against the Congress for the first time

 unhone kaha ki meerut maamle main doshi logon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai hogi
 The SP chief alleged that BJP and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh are trying to organize riots in the state due to VHP not being allowed to organize Chaurasi Kosi Parikrama but SP will continue to fight them

 Purushottam Sharma also said that this dispute is with the police family and hence, he would keep all these things in front of the IPS Association without talking too much in the media

 In the absence of Rabada, Delhi's bowling looks weak but captain Shreyas Iyer will not have to worry more than being able to perform well as a unit of batsmen
 chennai ke chaar wicket par 179 ran ke jawaab main dilli kii team 99 ran par out ho gai thi jisamen se ayyar ke 44 ran the

 kolkata or hyderabad kii haar ke baad unke 12 ank rah jaaenge or royles kii team plaof main pahunch jaaegi
 Rajasthan remains technically in the tournament despite having 11 points from 13 matches
 use dilli ko haraane ke saath baaki maichon main anukool nateezon kii ummid kerani hogi
 Defeating Delhi would give him 13 points

 Manmohan Singh: In the eyes of the urban youth, Villain No
 4 of politics Lal Krishna Advani calls gahe-bahega Prime Minister Manmohan Singh the weakest Prime Minister
 ittfa dekhie ki shahari yuva usee manmohan singh ko maanate hai raajnneeti ke villen number 3
 The Prime Minister's wavering attitude on the issue of inflation and corruption does not appeal to the urban youth
 arthshaastri magar gaiyr-raajnneetik maane jane vaale manmohan singh ne 22 may 2004 ko jab desh kii bagdor sanbhali to logon ko unase kaaphi ummiden thi
 But their lax attitude and habit of taking late steps on every issue from corruption to inflation does not like them
 indiatode-sinovet janamat surveykshan ke mutabik manmohan ke bharose or vaade par yuvaaon ko yakeen nahin he
 Inflation is skyrocketing and the economic growth rate is starting to fall below 7 percent
 tabhi to villen ke liye 10 point main manmohan ko mili hai 6
 65 point
 dilli or kolkata ke yuvaaon ke liye to manmohan hai duusare number kaa villen
 In this survey, Manmohan is the second most disliked leader in the three metros of the country - Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai
 laalkrishna adwaniindia today-sinovet janamat survey main agar shahari yuvaaon ne gadakari ko villen number 5 mana to chauthe number par bhi bijepi ke hi vayovruddh netaa aate hai
 Yes, he is Lal Krishna Advani
 shahari yuvaaon kii najar main adwani kii image ek aise netaa kii he, jiske paas naa to koi vyapak najariya he or naa hi system ko badalane ke liye thos ranneeti
 BJP veteran LK Advani, who went out on a rath yatra even at the age of 84, considers the youth of the country to be villain
 indiatode-sinovet janamat surveykshan main 18 se 25 saal ke 5 mahanagaron ke yuvaaon kii raay main adwani hai villen number 4
 He has got 6 in 10 points of dislike
 36
 Among the five metros, Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore are the most disliked at number three, with Advani at number five in Chennai
 1990 ke dashak main kattar hindutv ke nayak ke taur par ubhare adwani beshak kuch samay se apane soch main badlaav kaa ishaara karte rahe hon, lekin ye badlaav yuvaaon par asardaar chhap nahin chhod sakaa he
 The youth believe that Advani, who was once a PM in waiting, has no concrete and alternative agenda for the country and that is why he is the villain number 4
 nitin gadakarivillen number 5 hai bijepi adhyaksh nitin gadakari
 Urban youth are of the opinion that Gadkari with corporate culture will neither be able to connect BJP with the younger generation, or to get him out of the politics of old age rath yatra
 2009 main nitin gadakari ko bijepi kii kaman dete hue sangh or bijepi ne sochaa yahi tha ki gadakari kii aguwai main party yuva bharat kii nabz aasaani se pakad legi
 But it seems that Gadkari could neither hold onto BJP nor place in the heart of youth
 unke oche bol se bhi image bigadi
 In the latest survey of India today-synovate, Gadkari is at number five among the top five leaders the young generation of the country dislikes most
 india today-sinovet ne dilli, mumbai, chennai, kolkata or bangalore main 18 se 25 saal kii umr ke logon se raishumaari kii, to rashtriya str par sabase zyaada naapsand netaaon kii list main 6
 Gadkari is at number five after getting 04 numbers
 nitin gadakari par bijepi ko rashtriya raajnneeti main chamakaane kii jimmedaari he, lekin desh ke raajnneetik headquarter dilli main hi yuvaaon kii nazar main gadakari kii image acchhee nahin he
 The youth of Delhi gave Gadkari 6 out of 10
 95 number die or naapsandida netaaon kii list main unhen duusare number par pahunchaa diya
 Gadkari, known for his fiery speeches, will now have to think how to put out the fire of hate that is burning in the hearts of the youth
 shahari yuvaaon ko naa to sonia gandhi bahut pasand hai, naa rahul gandhi, naa hi gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi or naa hi upi kii mukhyamantri mayawati
 But if there is any least dislike among the youth, then she is Mayawati
 desh ke netaaon ke rang-dhang badalen naa badalen, lekin desh ke naujavaanon kii soch ab tezi se badalane lagi hai
 Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi is making a hue and cry against Mayawati in UP, but the youth of India today-synovate survey are liking Mayawati's attitude more than Rahul's defiance
 naapsandida netaaon kii list main jahaan rahul gandhi chaudaaven number par hai, vahiin mayawati kaa number unke baad aata he
 Congress president Sonia Gandhi's graph has fallen further to the youth involved in this survey
 india today-sinovet survey main desh ke paanch mahanagaron ke yuvaaon ne sonia gandhi ko apni naapsandi kii suchi main 11wein number par rakhaa he
 The special thing is that Narendra Modi is one step ahead of Sonia in the list of Sonia, who is at number 10 in the list of dislike
 is lihaaj se dekha jaae to apni thasak or murtiyon ke liye aalochana kaa centre banane vaali mayawati kii image sonia, modi or rahul teenon se behatar he
 There is no political party whose leaders are liking the urban youth
 left se lekar lalu or karunanidhi tak naapasandon kii suchi main shaamil hai
 Moreover, even Jayalalithaa is not pleasing the youth of the metros, who were recently installed by the people of Tamil Nadu on the chair of the Chief Minister
 vaise yuvaaon kii raay baaki netaaon ke liye bhi thik nahin he
 Prakash Karat is villain number six in the eyes of youth
 sipiem mahasachiv prakaash karaat ko marxvaadi party kaa yuva cheharaa mana jaataa he, lekin survey main shaamil yuvaaon ne karaat ko 10 main se 5
 Giving 88 number, he was ranked number six among disliked leaders
 yuvaaon kii nazar main em karunanidhi hai raajnneeti ke villen number seven
 The 2G scam marks are visible at the door of Karunanidhi's house
 karunanidhi kii raajnneeti kaa rang-dhang chennai ke yuvaaon ko sabase zyaada naapsand he, vahiin baaki mahanagaron ke yuvaaon ne karunanidhi ko 10 main se 5
 Ranked number 83 in the list of leaders who are not liked
 yuvaaon kii nazar main jayalalita hai raajnneeti kii villen number 8
 Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa also could not be happier as her name comes right after Karunanidhi in the list of disliked leaders
 jayalalita ko yuvaaon ne 10 main se 5
 Ranked eighth among leaders disliked by giving number 7
 yuvaaon kii nazar main grih mantri pi chidambaram he raajnneeti ke villen number 9
 The thinking of Home Minister p Chidambaram is also not very good
 india today-sinovet survey main shaamil yuvaaon ne chidambaram ko naapsandida netaaon main nauven number par rakhaa he or unhen number die hai 10 main se 5
 69
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi hai raajnneeti ke villen number 10
 Narendra Modi is flirting to come out of his radical image, but his desire to become a development man is not even appealing to the youth of the metros
 narendra modi 10 main se 5
 Ranked tenth in the list of disliked leaders with number 66
 naapsandgi kii suchi main 11 wein number par sonia gandhi, 12wein number par petroleum mantri jaipal reddy, 13wein number par argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav, 14wein number par rahul gandhi or 15wein number par upi kii mukhyamantri mayawati aati hai
 This survey by India today-synovate indicates that the youths no longer attract the slogans of the parties
 unhen pasand aata he netaaon kaa kaam, unki eemaandaaree or safagoi
 These days, clouds are raining heavily in Madhya Pradesh after the initial monsoon rains

 maharashtra main bijepi ke diggaj obisi netaa narazkhadse or pankaja munde ko manaane main juty bijepimaharashtra kii siyasat main bade ulatpher kii sugabugahat dikh rahi he
 With the formation of the Shiv sena-congress-ncp government and the bjp's withdrawal from power in Maharashtra, rebellion within the party has started rising
 maharashtra main bijepi kaa obisi cheharaa maane jane ekanath khadse or pankaja munde ne chunavi ke baad se baagi rukh akhriyaar kar liya he to vinod taavade khamoshi akhriyaar kiye hue hai
 This has increased the tension of Maharashtra BJP and the party has come under Damage Control
 khadse ke baagi rukh se bijepi pareshanbijepi kaa obisi cheharaa maane jane vaale ekanath khadse maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav nattejey aane ke baad se hi party ke kuch netaaon ko lekar lagaataar apni naaraazgi jaahir kar rahe hai
 He said on Sunday that if my insults continue in the party, then i will have to consider other options
 khadse ne yah bhi daawa kiya tha ki bijepi pratyaashee pankaja munde or rohinee khadse kii haar ke liye bijepi ke hi kuch netaa or kaaryakarta jimmedaar hai
 BJP leader Eknath Khadse on Tuesday met Koshivasena Supremo and Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray
 khadse ne siem saath kareeb 40 minute bitaye
 Earlier on Monday, he has also met NCP chief Sharad Pawar
 itnaa hi nahin khadse bijepi se naaraaz chal rahi pankaja munde ke saath bhi meeting kar chuke hai
 Let me tell you that during the ticket distribution before the election, Eknath Khadse was angry and had filed his nomination as an independent candidate
 iske baad party ne unki beti rohinee khadse ko muktainagar seat se tikat diya tha, lekin nirdaleey pratyaashee chandrakant nimba patil se unhen 1957 maton se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 This is the reason why Khadse's meeting with the leaders of opposition parties has started extracting political meaning
 pankaja munde kaa kal shakti pradarshnamaharashtra bijepi ke kaddavar netaa rahegopinath munde kii raajnneetik viraasat sambhaal raheen pankaja mundene apane chachere bhai or ensipi netaa dhananjay munde ko haathon parali seat se chunaav haar ke baad se baagi rukh akhriyaar kiye hue hai
 Pankaja Munde wants to show her political strength in the politics of Maharashtra on December 12, the birth anniversary of her father Gopinath Munde, in which she can take a major political decision
 unke samarthakon kaa aarope he ki obisi varg or party main netritv khatm karne ke liye bijepi ke kuch netaaon ne hi pankaja mande ko chunaav main haraaya
 Pankaja had increased political stirring by writing Facebook posts
 unhone likhaa tha, 'badale raajnneetik maahaul ko dekhte hue yah sochane kii jarurat he ki aage kya kiya jaae? apni shakti pahchaanane kii jarurat he
 i need 8-10 days to talk to myself
 ' isi ke saath unhone apane twitor profile se 'bijepi' kaa tag bhi hataa diya tha
 He has not been active in the BJP since then
 mangalvaar ko bijepi kor cameti kii baithak se bhi pankaja munde nadraad raheen
 JUDIBJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar told BJP Damage Control that we decided to consult with Eknath Khadse at the party's core committee meeting, his concerns will be taken care of
 bijepi ke khilaaf kaam karne vaale kaaryakartaaon ko lekar khadse ji ne kuch saboot saunpe hai
 Anyone who has acted against the party will be expelled
 maharashtra kii siyasat main pankaja munde or ekanath khadse kii purv siem fadanvis ke bich chhattis ke aankade maane jate hai
 At the same time, Vinod Tawde, who is considered a strong leader of the OBC category, has been silent since the ticket was cut, which Eknath Khadse has recently met
 mana ja rahaa he ki in teenon obisi netaaon ke bich koi siyaasi khichdi pak rahi he
 bjp's three OBC side lines in Maharashtra: Due to Gopinath Munde, Eknath Khadse and Vinod Tawde in Maharashtra, the BJP succeeded in making inroads in the OBC community, but unfortunately Munde died in a car accident in 2014
 iske baad unki beti pankaja or preetam ne unki viraasat ko sambhala
 When the BJP formed the government in Maharashtra in 2014, Pankaja Munde, Eknath Khadse and Vinod Tawde also became ministers
 lekin ye teenon obisi netaa alag-alag kaarnon se maharashtra kii siyasat ke seen se philhal kinare kar die gaye hai
 Where the party did not give tickets to Eknath Khadse and Tawde, Pankaja Munde lost the election
 maharashtra kii raajnneeti ke maujuuda paridrishy par najar daalen to bijepi ke paas obisi category kaa koi bada netaa nahin dikhataa he
 But the BJP cannot leave such a large vote bank of obcs without leadership
 isiilie bijepi ne khadse or pankaja munde ko manaane ke liye sudhir mungantiwar or bhupendra yadav ko lagaaya he
 In such a situation, it is to see which political OBC faces take political action

 sar creek par tippanee ke liye gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi par palat kar hamalaa bolte hue videsh mantri salmaan khurshid ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki modi ko chunavi phaayde ke liye ‘rashtriya hiton se samjhauta’ nahin karnaa chahie
 Questioning the source of Modi's information, Khurshid said that India and Pakistan are negotiating a number of sensitive issues, including Sir Creek, and "we have not told them anything about this dialogue yet
" agar koi unhen seemaa paar se yah sab nahin bataa rahaa he to unhen kaise yah sab pataa he
 In a letter written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday as a 'common man', Modi had demanded that the controversial Sir Creek should not be handed over to the neighboring country
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ne is aarope kaa kade shabdon main khandan karte hue aaropon ko ‘bebuniyaad’ tathaa ‘shararthpurna’ qaraar diya tha
 The Prime Minister's Office while replying to Modi's letter said, "the allegations in the letter that Sir Creek is going to be handed over to Pakistan is a lie
" modi dwaara is kathith tathy par nikaala gaya nishkarsh bhi sahi nahin he
 'khurshid, who is on a three-day visit to Myanmar, also said that Modi should focus his attention on the election and leave the task of running the country on us
 ’videsh mantri ne kaha ki bharat or pakistan ne samgr vaarta kii he or ‘vyaavhaarik’ kaam karne kaa faisla kiya he tathaa sar creek bhi inamen ek mudda he lekin modi ko pataa hona chahie ki ye mudde ratorat hal nahin hote
 Khurshid said, 'but he does not know the meaning of the talks
 ’ My name is Abhay Kumar
 main haryana kaa rahane vaala hum
 i was very good from the beginning
 iske baad bhi mere pita or skool teacher mujhase naaraaz rahete the
 The reason for that was my greater focus on maths
 mujhe bachapan se hi maths main bahut ruchi thi, jis vajah se main kisi or vishay par dhyaan nahin detaa tha
 However, after Maths, another topic i liked was Physics
 mere duusare vishyon main ruchi nahin lene ke chalate aksar mere teacher papa se shikaayat kar dete the
 One day Dad got so angry with me that he tore all my math books a little before my 10th exam and said that if you read maths before the exam then it will not be okay
 tumhen paper dene kii jarurat bhi nahin he
 i got very upset, then my mother came near and said that whatever you have to read, no one will stop you
 maine jaise-taise duusare vishyon kii padhai shuru kii lekin duusare koi bhi vishay mujhe achche nahin lagate the
 Then came the day of exam and i gave all the exams
 rigelt ke din to mujhe bahut dar lag rahaa tha
 When i finally saw the result, i got 84% number in Maths
 is baat kaa aaj bhi mujhe afsos he agar aakhri samay main papa ne meri kitaaben nahin phadi hoti to mere 100 fisadi number aa sakate the
 All i will say here is that parents should always give their child complete leeway to do whatever they want to do
 tabhi ve aage behatar kar sakenge

 desh kii pehali mahila pradhanmantri indira gandhi kii shahadat ko raashtra kabhi nahin bhula paaegaa
 October 31, 1984 was the date when Indira Gandhi sacrificed for the unity and integrity of the country
 31 aktubar 1984, ko buudhvaar kaa din
 The last morning of October
 mausam puri tarah karavat le chukaa he
 The cold has knocked in Delhi
 gunguni dhoop ke bich halki sard hawa chal rahi he
 In the lawn of a Safdarjung bungalow, flowers are also blooming with neem and tamarind trees all around
 1, safadarajang ke parisar ke andar hi do bangale hai
 One bungalow houses the Prime Minister's office and several rooms to meet people, while the other bungalow is the Prime Minister's private quarters, where Indira Gandhi lives with her son Rajiv Gandhi, daughter-in-law Sonia Gandhi and grandchildren Rahul and Priyanka
 is vakt bangale main pradhanmantri indira gandhi or unki badi bahu sonia gandhi hi maujuud hai
 Rajiv Gandhi has been visiting West Bengal in preparation for the Lok Sabha elections to be held in January 1985, while Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi, both grandchildren of Indira Gandhi, have left for school early in the morning
 priyanka or rahul ko gale laga kar skool bhejne ke baad indira gandhi kuch der lon me hi tahalti hai
 Despite being 66 years of age, she is not only fully fit but is also preparing to become the Prime Minister of the country for the fifth time
 indira gandhi akasar der raat raat kaam kiya karti thim or subah chaar baje uth bhi jaati thim
 She often used to say that even four hours of sleep is enough, but on 31 October morning she woke up a little late
 darasal wo urisa kii thakaa dene vaali chunavi raily se ek din pehle hi lauti thim
 After the morning walk and routine yoga, Indira Gandhi now started getting ready to go to her office
 ye subah unke liye khaas he
 Peter Ustinov, a British journalist, is waiting for him in his office outside the compound
 darasal peter indira gandhi ke jivan par ek documentry bana rahaa he
 And for this documentary, he was going to interview Indira Gandhi
 peter ek din pehle hi indira gandhi ke saath urisa daure main do din bitaane ke baad dilli lautaa he
 As the interview is finalized and the interview is part of a documentary, Indira Gandhi starts getting her makeup done at the request of a British journalist
 abhi indira gandhi mechap hi karvaa rahi thim ki tabhi unke nijee sachiv aarake dhawan daftar pahunche
 He also knew about this interview beforehand
 kuch hi der main indira gandhi kaa mekap puraa ho gaya
 After this, she came out of the office with RK Dhawan
 9 bajkar 27 minute par indira gandhi apane bangale se ek akbar rod par bane apane daftar kii taraf badhanaa shuru karti hai
 The one-hour interview is to be recorded here
 indira aage-aage chal rahi hai, jabaki unase do-teen kadam peeche bhartiya tibet seemaa police ke suraksha guard or aarake dhawan chal rahe hai
 To go from Safdarjung bungalow to an Akbar Road office, only one gate has to be crossed and Indira Gandhi is now moving towards the same gate
 indira ab dhire-dhire get ke kareeb hoti ja rahi hai
 Keeping pace with them, the security guards and Dhawan are still following
 ab tak sab kuch shant or khamosh he or sab kuch vaisaa hi ho rahaa he jaisaa pradhanmantri daftar ke routine or vakt ke hisaab se hona chahie
 At 9:28, Indira Gandhi reaches the gate very close
 unhen kareeb aata dekh khaas get par tainaat donon suraksha guard satvant singh or beant singh fouran alert ho jate hai
 Both of these are the only Sikh guards under the protection of Indira Gandhi
 darasal 6 june 1984 ko amritsar ke swarna mandir main hue oparation blue star ke baad indira gandhi kii suraksha main tainaat sabhi sikh guards hataa liye gaye the
 This was done after the intelligence agencies reported, but when Indira Gandhi came to know about this, she strongly opposed it and called back all the Sikh Guards
 get par tainaat guard beant singh ko indira gandhi das saal se jaanati hai
 This is his favorite guard, while Satwat Singh, who is a few steps away from Beant Singh, has come under the protection of the Prime Minister only five months ago
 sirf do maheene pehle hi kisi ne satvant singh or beant singh ko pradhanmantri nivas main dekh kar indira gandhi se ye poocha tha ki golden temple main army bhejne ke unke vivaadaaspad faisle ke baad bhi kya wo apane sikh suraksha guard par bharosa karti hai? tab indira gandhi ne beant singh kii taraf dekhne ke baad ye jawaab diya tha ki jab tak mere paas aise sikh hai tab tak mujhe darane kii jarurat nahin he
 The same Beant Singh was giving duty at the gate with Satwant Singh
 get kii taraf badhati indira gandhi ko kareeb aate dekh donon kii saanse achaanak tej ho jaati hai
 Indira Gandhi, who wore an orange print saree at 9:29 am, is now barely seven feet from the gate
 tabhi indira gandhi kii najar donon guard kii najaron se takaraati he
 Satwant and Beant Singh say hello to them as soon as they see their eyes
 indira gandhi bhi muskuraate hue donon ko jawaab detii hai
 
 
 Hello
 ye unke munh se niklaa aakhri shabd tha
 At 9:30, Idh Indira replied to both of them, at the same moment, Beant Singh, in a blink of an eye, took out a service revolver of the point 38 bore on his waist and fired three bullets one after the other
 goli lagate hi indira gandhi vahiin zamin par gir padin, par isse pehle ki unke saath chal rahe suraksha guard yaa aarake dhawan kuch soch bhi pate ki tabhi satvant singh ne apni stengan kaa munh jameen par lahooluhaan giri indira gandhi kii taraf ghumaya or megsine main jamaa 27 kii 27 goliyaan khaali kar deen
 In this way a great leader of the country went away to the hereafter, abandoning the Ihloka

 Like the last assembly election, Modi's masks are no longer visible in his election campaign
 2007 ke chunaav main unka yah prayog behad safal rahaa tha
 Five years later, Modi's way of campaigning has also changed in view of the changed circumstances

 He gives direct communication to the public while giving speeches as before

 When the public's enthusiasm is slightly less, he also plays a clap of himself on the right palm with the left hand on the lines of Amitabh Bachchan
 bich-bich main vah haathon ko saamne kii ore rakhkar vibhinn tarah kii bhavabhangimaayein bhi karte hai
 Be aware that Amitabh is also the brand ambassador of Gujarat
 modi ke chunavi bhaashanon se is dfa ‘56 inch kaa seenaa’ or ‘maut kaa saudagar’ jaisaa ‘vanaliner’ gaayab he
 In search of this, he repeatedly attacks and provokes Congress President Sonia Gandhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi

 Addressing one such election meeting in Surat, Modi says, 'madam Sonia, Manmohan Singh and Yuvraj are in tension due to fear of coming to Gujarat
 tension yah he ki kahin bhaashan dete vakt unki jubaan se aadaa-tedha shabd na nikal jaae

 Arrange for- Treat the women of the house well- Burn lamps at morning and evening in the place of worship, if there are ants in the house- a little flow in the sweet food It is not a bad symptom if there are so many ants - but if the ants start eating in everything, then it means - Mars is not good - due to this there are differences in the family, there is tension and separation in the brother
 - Wherever the ants appear, put a little flour in it - Read Sundara Kand at home on every Tuesday - Offer sweet cheese to Lord Hanuman at home on this day
 vijay maalya ke pratyrpan maamle main nayaa mode aa saktaa he
 It is reported that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken to the British Prime Minister Teresa May at the ongoing G20 Summit in Germany
 mana ja rahaa he ki is maamle main bharat sarkaar ham har haal main maalya kaa pratyrpan chaahati he
 Significantly, Vijay Mallya was arrested in April following a Westminster court order
 haalanki usee court ne 3 ghante main unhen jamaanat de di thi
 Mallya is accused of taking loans of more than 9 thousand crores from Indian banks
 maalya ko bharat sarkaar ne bhagoda ghoshit kar rakhaa he
 Mallya is known for his racy and glowing life
 sharaab udyog se paisa banane or kai anya vyavsaayon main haath aajamaakaar teji se ubharne vaale vijay maalya aaj achaanak bed bvoy ke rup main sabake saamne hai
 The story of Vijay Mallya, popularly known as Liquor King, seems completely filmy
 bainkon ke 'NPA' sankat ke pratik banesharab udyog se teji se paisa banane valemalyaaj bank udyog ke 'nan parforming asset' sankat ke pratik ban gaye hai
 Vijay Mallya was called 'king of Good Times', but today it has become a joke
 sharaab kaa kaarobaar viraasat main milapolitician, sahaara force india, royal chalangers, macdowell, mohan bagaan, kingfisher or east bengal ke maalik rahe vijay maalya kaa janm 18 disambar, 1955 ko hua tha
 Vitthal Mallya, father of Mallya born in Kolkata, was also a well-known businessman of the country
 unki mata kaa naam lalita ramaiya he
 Mallya inherited the liquor business from father Vitthal Mallya
 unhone desh ke pratishthit management sansthaanon se logon ko chunaa or is sharaab udyog ko ek corporate rup diya
 Trying to change the image in many fields, the information states that Vijay Mallya wanted people to know him not as a big wine businessman but as an industrialist
 kyonki bharat main sharaab vyavsaay ko acchhee nazaron se nahin dekha jaataa
 So perhaps Mallya invested in engineering, fertilizer, television and charter airline companies
 airlines par khub paise udaaemalya ne jab kingfisher airline shuru kiya to khub paise udaae
 When a passenger missed a flight, they used to send it to another destination from another airline
 unhone yah maan liya ki log unke flying five star hotel par tut padenge
 Mallya says - He ordered expensive foreign magazines and magazines for the passengers, but perhaps he could never get out of the warehouse
 company ke munaafe par in baton kaa bura asar padana hi tha
 The habit of making decisions in a jolt: Mallya kept getting into trouble due to the decision to take some decisions in business and the habit of buying new companies in a jolt and many times without taking a decision on the ledger
 phone par air dekan kii dealkingfisher airline ko antarrashtriya vimaanan company banane ke liye maalya ne capten gopinath kii company air dekan kharidi thi
 There is a famous story about Mallya calling Gopinath from his yacht that he wants to buy air decks
 gopinath ne kaha, ek hajaar karod rupee
 Mallya did not even look at the balance sheet of Air Deccan and sent a demand draft to Gopinath
 naa karj liya naa hi difaltermalya ye kehete rahe hai ki kingfisher airlines, esbiai capital markets or ek mashhoor antarrashtriya vimaanan salaahkaar se salaah mashvira ke baad shuru kii gai thi
 The state of the economy and government policies at that time were the reasons for the company's plight
 vijay maalya ne ek bayaan main kaha, 'vyaktigat taur par maine karj nahin liye hai or na hi main difolter hum 
 Today, Mallya's image as a defaulter has become the reason for luxury life and real jealousy
 likar king ke naam se mashhoor vijay maalya vyapaar se zyada apni lagjri life, daulat or shoharat ko lekar charchaa main rahete the
 Apart from absconding cars, yachts, horse races with a loan of 9 thousand crores, 17 banks have a debt of about 9 thousand crores on Famous Mallya for following different looks
 ve britain bhaag gaye the
 Despite drowning in debt, Mallya's Aisho Aaram and Page Three's parties remained unimpressed

 One was the period when former Union Minister Kalpath Rai represented here, the development work he had done in his time has lost its luster over time
 mau aaj vikaas or jativaadee raajnneeti ke doraahe par khadaa he
 The people of the region tell that development here can only happen when the people elected from here will have the willpower like Kalpath Rai

 The reason for this is Bahubali Mukhtar Ansari and his father Abbas Ansari
 mukhtaar mau sadar se chunavi maidan main hai to unka betaa ghoshi se taal thonk rahe hai
 Mukhtar's biggest challenge before his victory is to send his son to the assembly as well, amidst strong siege of opponents

 mau sadar vidhansabha seatjile kii is seat se philhal kaumi ekta dal ke charchitabahubali mukhtaar ansaari vidhayakahain, badale hue raajnneetik sameekaran ke bich vah is baar bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ke tikat par chunavi maidan main hai
 He is considered very dominant in this area, the result of his victory in this seat dominated by Bhumihar and Rajbhar has been his wealth and muscle power
 mukhtaar ansaari philhal jail main band hai, pichley vidhansabha chunaav main vah perul par baahar aae the
 Then he also made air in his favor through campaigning and won and reached the assembly
 is baar ucch nyaayalay ne perul kii unki yachika khaarij kar unke mansoobon par pani pher diya he, vahiin duusari ore virdohi dalon ne bhi is baar unki tagdi gherebandi kar rakhi he
 Actually, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has not fielded its candidate from this seat
 bhaajapa kaa bhartiya samaaj party (bhaasapa) ke saath gathbandhan hone ke baad yah seat unke khate main chali gai, bhaasapa ke adhyaksh oprakash rajbhar ne yahaan se apane samadhi mahendra rajbhar ko tikat diya he
 Mahendra Rajbhar said that Mau is untouched by development, the lack of Kalpnath opinion hurts everyone, he was a development man
 jab tak rahe, is jile par mafiaon or bahubaliyon kii chaaya tak najar nahin ai
 It was only after his death that Dhanbali and Bahubali continued to dominate, although the public would teach him a lesson in this election

 The people of the area say that Altaf Ansari is a well-known name of the area, due to the area, their penetration is more in the Muslim community
 altaaf is seat par muslim or yadav votbank ke sahare mukhtaar ko kadi takkar de rahe hai
 The district's political analyst says that with the arrival of Altaf Ansari, there is an increased risk of burglary in the Muslim community, which will add to Mukhtar Ansari's troubles
 yahaan ek taraf jahaan muslim maton main bikharaav saaf najar aa rahaa he, vahiin duusari taraf bhoomihaar, rajbhar or thakur matadaata bhi lamaband ho rahaa he
 Its direct effect will be seen on the result
 ghoshi vidhansabha sitaghoshi loksabhaa seat se kalpanaath raay kabhi saansad hua karte the, unke nidhan ke baad haalanki parivaar main hi kalah chhid gaya or iskaa laabh virodhiyon ne uthaaya
 Therefore, Kalpnath Rai's family is politically marginalized here
 is seat se basapa ne mukhtaar ansaari ke putr abbaas ansaari ko tikat diya he
 Abbas's image, however, is the exact opposite of his father's
 haalanki abbaas ko apano se hi chunauti bhi mil rahi he, darasal, basapa ne yahaan se sthaneey netaa wasim ikbaal urf chunnu ko pehle hi tikat de diya tha
 But later, with the aim of cashing in on Mukhtar's image, the BSP supremo finally fielded Mukhtar's son Abbas from this seat, Abbas now fears that if Wasim Iqbal had committed a beggar, his dream of becoming a legislator would be lost
 sapa ne yahaan se vartmaan vidhayak sudhakar singh ko hi tikat diya he, ilaake main unki acchhee khaasi paith he
 Although the people of the area say that there is also the effect of anti-incumbency against them, people are very angry due to the lack of development of the area
 sudhakar singh kehete hai ki aisa nahin he, yahaan vikaas ke kaaphi kaam hue hai
 This is being propagated by the opponents
 mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke kaam ke dam par hi ham janata ke bich ja rahe hai, janata se acha sahyog mil rahaa he
 Those who are claiming no development work in the area will get the answer automatically after the election
 ghoshi ke hi ramkumar rajbhar kehete hai ki vikaas kaary puri tarah se thapp hai, kisaan sahakaari mil band ho chuki he

 dilip vengsarakar ne somvaar ko sharajah main daaud ibrahim ke indian cricket team ke dressing room main aane kaa zikr kya choda, desh ke most wonted aatankwaadi or kapil dev ke bich maukhik muthbhed kii nai nai paraten saamne aane lageen
 According to Vengsarkar, Dawood was banished from the room by Kapil Dev
 javed miyandad ke mutabik maine vengsarakar ko kaha ki daaud kapil dev se gussa he
 And Ravi Shastri, who was in the team at that time, now told that as soon as Kapil Dev came to know who Dawood is, he went to apologize to him
 aaie sabase pehle yah jaanate hai alag alag logon ke hawaale se ki aakhir 1987 main sharajah main hue australesia cap main hua kya
 
 
 The smuggler that came with comedian Mahmood the next day was a match between India and Pakistan
 team ke sabhi khilaadi practice seshan ke baad dressing room main the, jabaki kapil dev baahar press conference atend kar rahe the
 Then famous Hindi film comedian Mahmood arrived in the dressing room with a man
 ye aadmi tha daaud ibrahim, jisaki us vakt tak ek charchit smagaller ke taur par pahchaan ban chuki thi
 No one could recognize Dawood except Vengsarkar
 vengsarakar mumbai se aate hai or vahaan ke local media main daaud kii photo dekh chuke the
 When he was seen with Mahmud, Vengsarkar's vision changed with confidence
 udhar mahmud ne jab apane dost kaa bhartiya cricketron se parichay karaayaa to bas itnaa hi kaha ki ye mere dost hai, yaheen sharajah main bijness karte hai or aap sabake liye ek bada ofer lekar aae hai
 Did you say Dawood Dawood, if you beat Pakistan tomorrow, i will give a car to all the players
 us vakt team ke manager the, jayavant lele
 He was also present in the dressing room
 unhone yah ofer sunne ke baad daaud se poocha, main manager hum, kya mujhe bhi car milegi
 Dawood said smiling, yes you will get it too
 khilaadiyon ne pataa kiya ki koun si car ofer kii ja rahi he, to jawaab aayaa toyota corola, jo us vakt kii behad popular car thi
 Then Kapil's entry was going on that Kapil settled down and entered the dressing room
 vah players se kuch baat karnaa chaahate the
 His eyes fell on Mahmud 
 kapil bole, mahmud sahab aap jaraa baahar niklo
 And then pointing to David, he said, and who is this
 chal baahar chal
 After hearing these words of Kapil, Dawood quietly exited the dressing room and said, yes this car cancellation
 javed miyandad kyon aevengsarakar ke mutabik is ghatana ke baad unke dressing room main pakistani player javed minyaadaad aae
 He said that Kapil should not have dealt with Dawood in this way
 bakaul javed, yaar usko pataa nahin, wo daaud ibrahim he
 He will do some problems
 is par vengsarakar ne jawaab diya ki kapil ko koi dikkat nahin paidaa kar saktaa
 Neither in India nor outside
 is puure apisod par kapil dev kaa yahi kahana he ki mujhe zyada kuch yaad nahin
 There was someone who did not belong to the team and whom i asked to go out
 kapil ne kabuula ki us vakt dressing room main javed miyandad bhi the
 Ravi said, Kapil asked for forgiveness
 The twist came in the entire episode when Ravi Shastri said that yes, Kapil Dev told Dawood to go out, but when Smuggler's identity was revealed to him, Kapil Dev went to apologize to Dawood
 
 bakaul ravi haa, daaud akasar aata tha
 He also came to Sharjah
 mujhe uski aamad se pehle hi iskaa pataa chal gaya or main chaay ke bahaane khisak liya
 Later Kapil went to Dawood and apologized

 unka maananaa he ki ye dastaveji rahasyodghatan sirf ek halki-si jhalak hai
 For over a decade, RTI activists and researchers have been of the view that the loss of confidential files so far could shed some light on the disappearance of this miraculous inkling

 Bose family espionage The CID in the British Raj had been monitoring the two houses of the Bose family in Kolkata-1 since the 1930s - one was a house at Woodburn Park and the other was 38 @ 2, Elgin Road
 yahi vah samay tha jab sharat chandra or unke chote bhai subhash chandra bose bengal main swatantraaa andolan ke agua banakar ubhare the
 The family got used to the shadow of CID

 When he came to the Bose family to admit his mistake, the elder brother asked him to come and take him a few days later

 They dodged the police and left the house on Elgin Road and stayed in Nazi-ruled Germany

 There was a lot of mention of Netaji in this correspondence

 Netaji's wife mentioned in his letters the economic crisis of the family, the upbringing of the daughter and the repair of the house in Vienna

 The IB has outlined in these letters the names of Emily Shankel's visitors

 The monitoring center for the letters that were seized was almost entirely the Elgin Road Post Office where the Bose family would without doubt cast their letters

 The disappointment stemming from not recognizing uncle was also expressed

 He considered him his elder brother and even he named a regiment of INA after Nehru

 Then the question arises, why did the Nehru government take such a strict watch of the Bose family? This question is also special because Nehru hated detective work

 pichley varshon main bose kii saahasgatha ne na sirf rahasy kathaon ko janm diya balki littey ke purv pramukh prabhakaran jaise tamaam prashansakon ko bhi apni ore khinchaa
 Bose is believed to have fled to China and the Soviet Union, from where he returned to India as "baba" in Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh, and died in 1985
 bose ke jinda rahete unke bhaagane kii ye kahaniyaan gadhi gai thiah afghanistan jane ke liye bose ne pathan kaa vesh dharaa, rus main yatra karne ke liye ve italvi kaarobaari ban gaye, or hind mahaasaagar ke bichobich germany kii pandubbi se japan kii pandubbi main aa gaye
 Had the government not refused to make Netaji's files public, then all these stories would have come to an end
 vajahat habibulla kehete hai, ''yah tathy apane aap main bose ke rahasy ko or gaharaa detaa he ki jin filon ko 1960 or 1970 ke dashak main saarvajanik kiya janaa chahie tha vaisaa ab tak nahin kiya gaya he
 During his five-year tenure as India's first Chief Information Commissioner, Habibulla received numerous applications to expose Netaji's files, which the government turned down
 nehru ke baad ai sabhi sarkaron ne netaaon, shodhakartaaon or patrakaron se ek hi baat kahi he ki netaji se judi 150 se zyada filon kii saamagree itani samvedansheel he ki unhen saamne laane se kanoon-vyavastha kii samasya paidaa ho sakati he, khaskar pashchim bengal main aisa ho saktaa he
 Worse, doing so would spoil India's relations with "friendly countries"
 '' modi sarkaar ne 2014 main kanoon vyavastha kaa bahaanaa to nahin banaaya lekin aadhikarik line vahi kaayam rahi
 On a question by Trinamool Congress MP Sukhendu Shekhar Roy, Minister of State for Home Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary said in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha on December 17, 2014, "removing privacy is not good in terms of India's relations with other countries
" '' piemo main band netaji se judi paanch filein itani gopneey hai ki soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat unke naam tak nahin bataae gaye
 The question arises that what such horrific government secret is hidden in these locked files in the PMO? In Roy's words, these are the secrets that led to Rajnath Singh Sachi's supporter turning into a man who "sat silently in the Lok Sabha shaking his head when i demanded that he be made public
" ''roy poochhate hai, ''vimaan haadase main hui netaji kii maut kaa dosha duusare deshon par kaise madha ja saktaa he
 Clearly, there are some other reasons BJP and Congress want to hide
 ''teen pradhanmantriyon ne ab tak is sachaai ko saamne laane ke liye jaanch aayogon kaa gathan kiya he-1956 main nehru, 1970 main indira gandhi or 1999 main atal bihari vaajapeyi
 Two of these - the Shahnawaz Committee of 1956 and the Khosla Commission in 1974 concluded that Netaji died in the plane crash
 inke nishkarshon ko tatkaaleen pradhanmantri morarji desai ne 1978 main khaarij kiya tha
 Justice (M
 ke
 ) The Mukherjee Commission said that Netaji had created a false story of his death and had fled to the Soviet Union
 ise 2006 main upie sarkaar ne khaarij kiya
 These investigations have often fueled speculation
 bijepi ke netaa subrahmanyam swami 1970 main khosla ayog ke samaksh shyaamalaal jain kii gavaahi kaa hawala dete hai jo nehru ke stenographer the
 Jain had confessed that he had typed a letter which Nehru had sent to Stalin in 1945 in which he confesses to Bose being taken hostage
 swami kaa daawa he, ''vimaan haadasa fareb tha
 Netaji took refuge in the Soviet Union where he was imprisoned
 baad main stallin ne unhen maar diya
 "his entire family, including Bose's daughter Anita, wants all reports held by the central and state governments to be exempted from the purview of secrecy
" chandra kumaar kehete hai, ''piemo, videsh mantralay, ibi, sibiai or itihaaskaaron ke pratinidhiyon kii khaas anveshan team banaakar un dastavejon par shodh hona chahie or subhash chandra kii kahani janata ke saamne laai jaani chahie
 "if the present revelations are really of any use, then the investigation of Netaji's files on the basis of them can serve to unravel India's oldest political mystery
 desh main kisi bhi aapadaa yaa apatkaal kii sthiti main sabhi helplinon ko jod kar ek single number, 2611 die jane kaa prastaav diya gaya he
 It is proposed to connect all the helplines across the country in this number
 neshnal immergency telephone number system (enitienes) ke taur par dial 2611 kii avadharana pune ke ek telecom ejeeniyar dinakar borde ne di he
 Borde said that there is talk of integrating local, regional and national helplines in this telephone number
 saath hi yah yaad rakhane main bhi aasaan he
 Borde sent this proposal to the Bureau of Police Research and Development, Ministry of Home Affairs in October last year
 borde ne bataaya ki enitienes ko is tarah dizin kiya gaya he ki yah apatkaal kii sthiti main kaary balon ko suchit karegaa or unamem samanvay sthapit karegaa
 It will be the same number for the entire country
 bharat sarkaar ke saath purv takneekee salaahkaar rahe borde ne bataaya ki apane prastaav main unhone suzav diya tha ki sabhi maujuuda apatkaaleen helpline numberon ko dial 2611 main jod diya janaa chahie
 He said that this number was chosen for two reasons, first it is safe and second, because it is easily linked to the Mumbai attacks
 borde ne bataaya ki jo vyakti is helpline par phone karegaa, vah kahaan he, is bare main jaankaree ek kendriya tantra ke aadhaar par hogi or bachaav dal kuch hi minuton main us tak pahunch jaaenge
 The telecom expert said, 'when you are going through an emergency, you have to be very clear about where you are
 enitienes main iske liye ek shaktishaalee telecom or info-tech tantra he
 According to Borde, 'I have developed Artificial Intelligence and Multilingual System in it, which will also facilitate the response in local language
 ’ jab bhi koi 2611 par phone karegaa, iske baad yah kol neshnal switchboard par jayega, jahaan se pataa lagaaya jayega ki kol karne vaala kahaan hai
 The switchboard then connects it to the nearest Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP), where specially trained officers arrange local rescue teams for the caller
 popular wais assistance products main send laga sakati he lite commandsahamalavar bhej saktaa he dur se hi sunai or dikhaai naa dene vaala commandugar aap appal, amejon, google jaisi top technology companiyon ke popular wais assistance productus kaa istemaal kar rahe hai to ye khabar aapke liye he
 Research teams from the University of electro-telecommunications, Tokyo, and the University of Michigan showed in a demonstration that "attackers can inject remotely heard and unseen commands to voice assistants with the help of laser lights
" ye wais assistance hai- google assistant, amejon alexa, fasebuk portal or appal siri”
 With the code-name of 'light Commands' this technique can be injected into 'wrong-purpose commands' in voice-controlled devices such as speakers, tablets and phones
 research team ne is hafte ke shuru main demonstrishan video jari kiya
 This video showed that commands up to the target could be sent over large distances, even in locked rooms, through glass windows
 (lite commands seoup leisure beam kaa istemaal kar wais assistance system ko hack karata he)research team kaa daawa he ki ‘in popular divices main ek samaan khami kaa phayda uthaate hue hamalavar dur se hi sunai or dikhaai naa dene vaali commands bhej saktaa he, phir ye divaais us cmand ko khud hi apana leti hai
 'once the voice support systems get penetrated, then the attacker also uses this same flaw to attack other systems
 research team ke mutabik hamalavar is khami kaa istemaal aapaki “online kharid, smart home swiches, smart garrej door, kuch nishchit vaahan, smart lox” par gaiyr aadhikarik niyantran paane ke liye bhi kar saktaa he
 How does it work? The research team includes Takeshi Sugawara, Benjamin Cyr, Sarah Rumpazzi, Daniel Jenkin and Kevin Fu
 researchteam ke prakashit ek shodh patr main khami ko vistaar se bataate hue kaha, audio ke alaava in divices ke microphone bhi us lite par riect karte hai jo sidhe un par aati he
 Smart voice assistants rely on the voice of the consumer to interact with the official users
 ‘lite kamands’ set-ap main chamakati leisure kaa microphons tak pahunch ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he or wais assistance ko kargar dhang se hijank kar liya jaataa he
 Unheard commands are then sent to Alexa, Siri, Portal and Google devices
 isi siddant ke aadhaar par research team ko microphons ko trick karke aise electric signal utpann karne main kamyaabi mili jaise ki wo asal main audio ko hi risive kar rahe hon
 For this, the electric signal was modulated according to the intensity of the light beam
 kitna kharch aata?set ap main khule bazaar main uplabdh products jaise ki telephoto lens, leisure driver, telescope yaa byanocular or anya upkarnon kaa istemaal hota he
 Researchers estimate that all the equipment required for 'light commands' can be acquired for less than $ 600
 wais assistance jaisi divices kii buniyadi khami ko tab tak dur nahin kiya ja saktaa jab tak ki inamen istemaal kiye jane vaale microphons ko ridizin nahin kiya jaataa
 However, researchers have approached popular manufacturers like Google, Amazon, Apple for a possible solution to this problem

 This time in the Lok Sabha elections, a fight to beat political rivals was fought on social media
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi rafel saude par pradhanmantri narendra modi ko 'chaukeedaar chor he' se gherne kii koshish karte rahe
 At the same time, PM Modi turned the narrator through social media and wrote 'main Bhi Chowkidar' in his Twitter handle
 iske baad sabhi bijepi netaaon or mantriyon ne apane twitor handle main ise joda, or yah jang puure chunaav tak bani rahi
 Meanwhile, a recent survey by lokniti-csds has come up
 isamen soshal media ko lekar kai chaunkaane vaale aankade saamne aae hai
 Survey figures show that social media is alleged to be dominated by upper castes
 survey main fasebuk, whatsap, twitor or instagram yugers ko shaamil kiya he
 The survey covers 5 years of data
 survey kii mjedaar baat yah he ki bharat ke kai sthanon kii tarah soshal media par bhi ucch jatiyon kaa varchasv barkaraar he
 According to the data, the upper cast has twice as much influence on social media as compared to Dalits and Adivasis
 apper class ke 15% log soshal media kaa istemaal karte hai, jabaki daliton or adivaasiyon kaa ye aankada kramshah 8 or 7 fisadi he
 Nine percent of Other Backward Classes (OBC) members use social media
 is hisaab se soshal media par daliton or adivaasiyon se OBC zyada sakriy he, lekin wo ab bhi apper cast se peeche he
 On the other hand, people who do not use social media saw a huge gap in society
 jahaan 75 fisadi adivasee or 71 fisadi dalit soshal media kaa yuj nahin karte hai vahiin varchasvshaalee jatiyaan main inaki sankhya 54 fisadi he
 On the social media platform, Muslim Mukhermusalman, whose large section is said to be educationally and economically behind the Dalit and tribal community, is more vocal on social media
 bharat main apper cast hindu ke baad alpsankhya samudaay ke log hi soshal media kaa sabase zyada jamkar istemaal kar rahe hai
 People belonging to minority communities are also ahead of Hindu obcs in being vocal on social media
 agar ham vyaktigat taur par dekhen to apper cast ke baad muslimon ke sakriy hone kaa yah pattern sabhi soshal media platform par ek samaan kamay he
 Muslim is the most used of all social media platforms after Upper Cast Hindu
 aankade bataate hai ki anya samudaayon ke mukaable ucch jatiyon ke log fasebuk, whatsap, utyub, twitor or istagram par sabase zyada active hai
 This pattern has been going on continuously for the last five years
 vahiin muslim duusare sthaan par hai jabaki iske baad dalit or adivaasiyon kii baari aati he

 PK, who is following Congress's campaign strategy for Uttar Pradesh and Punjab assembly elections, has now become active in Uttarakhand too
 sutron kii maane to chunavi prabandhan or prachaar ke lihaaj se prashanth kishor uttarakhand main bhi sakriy honge
 Actually Congress has realized that Harish Rawat may have done better, but he has failed to get publicity and popularize the slogans among the masses
 isiilie ab congress ne rahul gandhi ke khaas ranneetikaar prashanth kishor ko upi or punjab ke baad uttarakhand main bhi istemaal karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Team pk's slogan- 'everyone else is dream, Harish Rawat is his' Soon after this decision was made, Team PK gave a slogan- 'everything else is dream, Harish Rawat is his'
 
 
 is naare par thik-thaak rispance milane par congress mahasachiv evam uttarakhand kii prabharee ambika soni nerahul gandhiko report de di he
 He said that the party would benefit if Prashant Kishore and his team would take over the responsibility of campaigning in Uttarakhand and go ahead with the booth level workers of Congress party and other leaders, activists
 iske baad rahul ne bhi is prastaav ko hari jhandi de di or prashanth kishor upi or punjab ke baad uttarakhand main bhi congress ke pole manager ban gaye
 In this regard, when Aaj Tak spoke to Ambika Soni, he said that Prashant Kishore was already in charge of publicity and management with the help of Congress team in UP and Punjab
 vah ek profeshnal hai
 He himself proposed to cooperate in Uttarakhand, so we all accepted him
 unhone kaha, 'ab prashanth kishor or team pike rajya congress ke booth level kaaryakartaaon ke saath milakar congress party ke liye maahaul banane kii ranneeti banane main jute jaaegi
 We hope that it will benefit us
 'sutron kii maane to uttarakhand main harish ravat kaa badha hua kad congress ko phayda pahunchaa saktaa he, lekin jis tareeke se maamle ko janata ke bich oochaal kar phayda lenaa he, uttarakhand congress sarkaar kii nitiyon kaa phayda lenaa he, is masale par kahin naa kahin harish ravat kii sarkaar safal nahin ho paa rahi thi
 In such a situation, after the Punjab and UP, the Congress party has now landed PK in Uttarakhand

 The rld's base votebank was believed to be jat-muslim, but the anti-coalition camp of the RLD argues that it is difficult for Jats and Muslims to come together after the riots

 Ajit Singh has nothing left but a few Jat votebank

 It is unlikely that the Muslim section will vote for the RLD

 On the other hand, in favor of the alliance, the Congress faction supporting the alliance with RLD believes that even though Chaudhary Ajit Singh's party has to suffer the loss of jat-muslim split, the sp-congress-rld alliance benefits the Congress's Jat and other Hindu candidates
 Will deliver

 The controversy boils over again over Vande Mataram
 uttarakhand kii nai naveli bijepi sarkaar rajya ke inter collejon main vande maataram kaa paath anivaary karne ja rahi he
 The Muslim community has objected to Vande Mataram
 yani ki vande maataram par vivaad kii nai kist tay ho chuki he
 These lines (vande Mataram), which created the spirit of patriotism in the veins, have started again
 desh kii kuch sarkarein vande maataram kaa paath anivaary karne ke paksh main hai
 But the Muslim community is strongly opposing it
 vande maataram ko jaruri banane kaa ab nayaa prayasuttarakhandamen hua he
 Higher education minister in the state government Dhan Singh Rawat is saying that all communities have agreed in this matter
 bataate chalem ki mantri dhan singh ravat ne isse pehle rudki ejineering college main lagbhag dhamkee bhare swaron main kaha tha, 'uttarakhand main rahanaa hoga to vande maataram kahana hoga
 He made this statement in the presence of Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat and Assembly Speaker
 gauratlab he ki uttarakhand se pehle upi ke kai shaharon main bhi vande maataram par bakheda khadaa ho chukaa he
 Minorities are adamant that they will not sing this song, and some people in power are intent on singing Kivande Matramasubko
 ek ke liye vande maataram gaanaa kufr he, to duusare ke liye deshbhakt hone kaa certificate
 The controversy over Vande Mataram also reached the extent of the court, but the real question is about adding and reducing Vande Mataram with patriotism

 ' baithak main kisaanon ke khilaaf bal prayog kii ninda kii gai or unke adhikaron kii khatir ladane kaa sankalp liya gaya
 In the nehru-gandhi family, once again a political sword is raised
 apane bhai rahul gandhi kaa parchaa daakhil karaane amethi pahunchi priyanka ne chachere bhai varun gandhi ke khilaaf morcha khol diya
 Priyanka appealed to the people of Sultanpur to defeat Varun Gandhi, who is fighting on a BJP ticket, to defeat him
 rahul gandhi to umr main priyanka se do saal bade hai jabaki varun 8 saal chote
 In the changing political and family situation, Varun's path may have been different from Rahul and Priyanka, but they remain silent on the issue of family in private
 balki priyanka ne raajnneetik khatas ke bich bhi kai baar rishton main mithaas kaa abhas karaayaa
 But the relationship began to melt in the heat of the election
 amethi main kaaryakartaaon se baat karte hue kaha, 'hamaari ragon main khun or nafrat nahin daudti, prem or ekta daudti he
 If someone is following the wrong path, sometimes in politics, public prudence shows the right path
 'is bich bete par raajnneetik hamalaa bolaa gaya to maa phir se saamne aa gayi
 Maneka in turn explained to Priyanka that what is required is patriotism and patriotism, no certificate is needed
 unhone kaha, 'deshseva karnaa bhatakana he to koun rasta bhatak gaya he yah desh bataa degaa
 Priyanka's campaign against her brother is a very old association of Nehru Gandhi family from amethi-rae Bareli and Sultanpur seats
 ye bhi ittefaq he ki is baar in teenon seat par isi parivaar ke ek-ek daavedaar jame hue hai
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi is fighting on Rae Bareli seat, Rahul Gandhi in Amethi seat and Varun Gandhi, BJP general secretary on Sultanpur seat
 haalanki pichhali baar varun gandhi ne apni maa menka gandhi kii paramparaagat seat pilibhit se jeet hasil kii thi lekin is baar ghar se ghire ilaake main hi gharelu ghamaasan machaa he
 The Congress has fielded Amita Singh, wife of Sanjay Singh of Amethi royalty from Sultanpur seat
 chunaav kii majaburi dekhie ki ek bahan ko bhai ke khilaaf prachaar karnaa pad rahaa he
 That too in the name of improving it
 varun ke khilaaf purvi upi main ekajute hue congressipichhali baar sultanpur seat se congress ke sanjay singh jite the
 But then neither Sonia nor Rahul and Priyanka went to promote Sanjay Singh
 duusari taraf rahul gandhi ke parchaa daakhile main bhi sanjay singh pehle kabhi nahin jate the
 The party was one, but there was a different kind of sour relationship, but this time in Sultanpur, Varun changed their relationship by contesting elections
 rahul ke parchaa daakhile main sanjay singh ko bulaayaa gaya to sultanpur main sanjay singh kii patni ke liye priyanka vot maangane pahunchi, wo bhi apane hi bhai ke khilaaf
 Varun praised the work of brother Rahul, Priyanka talked about defeating Varun, the same Varun had praised Rahul's development work done in Amethi a few days back
 is par rahul samet congress khushi se foole nahin samaai lekin bijepi ko jor kaa jhatka jor se laga
 Then his mother Maneka Gandhi took the front on behalf of Varun - directly against Rahul
 isse kuch hi din pehle menka gandhi ne sonia kii sampatti par sawaal khadey kiye the
 She had said that she had not brought even a penny in dowry, so how did she become rich today
 kaaphi purana he yah jhagadaais jhagade kii jaden kareeb saadhe teen dashak gahari hai
 After the famine death of Sanjay Gandhi, once the path of his wife Maneka Gandhi separated, then Rajiv and Sanjay's family never got together again
 teen saal pehle jab varun gandhi shaadi karne chale to apni tai sonia or bade bhai bahan rahul priyanka ko nyauta dene khud pahunche the
 Then it was felt that on the pretext of that marriage, the relationship of their relationship might be opened and the sourness which had been going on for thirty years would be over
 lekin aisa ho nahin paaya
 Neither Sonia went to the wedding, neither Rahul nor Priyanka
 rishton kii wo ganth aaj bhi bandhi hui he, jo jab tab jubaan se jhalak jaati he
 The seeds of this bitterness in the relationship had fallen when Sanjay Gandhi died in the plane crash
 iske kuch dinon baad hi menka gandhi tatkaaleen pradhanmantri or apni saas indira gandhi ke ghar se nikal gayi
 He is said to have been evicted from the Prime Minister's residence
 iske baad 1984 ke chunaav main menka gandhi ne amethi main apane jeth rajeev gandhi ke khilaaf hi morcha sambhaal liya, magar apni jamaanat tak bachaa nahin pain
 The snow on the relationship was seen melting when Varun also attended Priyanka Gandhi's wedding in 1997
 chote bhai kii maujuudagi ye bataane ke liye kaaphi thi ki parivaar main sab thik ho rahaa he
 However, Maneka did not reach even then
 is bich varun gandhi bhi bijepi main shaamil ho gaye
 Mother Maneka was already there
 bas parivaar kii ladaai party kii jang main badalane lagi
 Change did not happen but efforts are on to defeat each other in the elections

 shivaraj singh chouhan sarkaar ne is saal april main ‘dinadayal rasoi yojana’ kii shuruyaat bade jor-shor se kii thi
 The scheme, which was started under the birth centenary celebrations of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay, was said to provide food to the poor for Rs 5
 pandit deen dayaal upaadhyaay ke aadarshon ke mutabik is yojana kaa lakshya samaaj main aakhri paaydaan par khadey vyakti tak raahat pahunchaana tha
 But now after about 8 months, also know the ground reality of this scheme
 shivaraj sarkaar ne is yojana ke liye abhi tak ek paisa bhi relies nahin kiya
 In such a situation, those who were entrusted with the responsibility of running this scheme are now talking of pulling back
 aaie pehle mukhyamantrishivraj singh chouhanake us bayaan par gaur karen jo unhone 7 april 2017 ko gwalior main ‘dinadayal rasoi yojana’ ke udghaatan ke vakt diya tha
 The Chief Minister had said, “an idea came to my mind
 maine garib logon ke bare main sochaa
 Those who are laborers, men and women who work hard for survival
 wo jo roji roti kii talash main shaharon main aate hai
 i thought they should not starve
 isi vichaar se ‘dinadayal rasoi yojana’ ne janm liya
 a scheme in the name of Deen Dayal Upadhyay, the messiah of the poor, in which nutritious and tasty food is made available to poor people for just 5 rupees
 meraa sapana he ki koi bhi bhookha nahin rahanaa chahie
 ”chief Minister Chauhan had also described this plan as the best way to remember Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay in his centenary year
 tamilnadu kii divangat mukhyamantri jayalalita kii ‘ammaa canteen’ kii tarj par madhya pradesh main shuru kii gai dinadayal rasoi yojana kaa ‘aaj tak / india today’ ne reality check kiya to chaunkaane vaale tathy saamne aae
 Pradeep Sharma is responsible for running the Deendayal Rasoi Yojana in Sehore, Chief Minister's home district
 is saal 7 april se hi sharma 500 logon ko har din 5 rupye prati vyakti ke hisaab se bhojan uplabdh kara rahe hai
 They get wheat and rice at the rate of Re 1 per kg
 lekin sharma kaa daawa he ki april main yojana shuru hone ke baad se ab tak wo apni jeb se 8 lakh rupye kharch kar chuke hai
 At the inception of the scheme, the government had promised that whatever the difference between the expenses incurred and the amount received at the rate of Rs 5 per person, will be compensated by the government
 sharma kaa daawa he ki abhi tak ek paisa bhi unhen sarkaar se nahin mila he
 According to Sharma, he has requested the government several times in this regard but did not get any reply
 sharma ne saath hi kaha ki aisi sthiti main unhen ‘dinadayal rasoi’ ko band karnaa padegaa
 The photo of Chief Minister Chauhan is prominently displayed in the banner of the scheme in Deendayal Rasoi
 deevaaron or token book par yojana ke bare main jo likhaa gaya he, usamen saaf kaha gaya he ki ye sarkari yojana he
 People who come to eat in the kitchen, seeing this, feel that the government helps to provide cheap food
 rasoi main khaanaa khaane vaale ek shaks ne kaha, “ye sarkari yojana he or agar ye band hoti he to bahut dukhad hoga
 "the Chief Municipal Officer of Sehore, Sudhi r Kumar Singh, says on this episode," This is not a government scheme
 ise daan dene waalon kii madad se chalaaya janaa tha
 Donors are not found in Sehore
 ham apni taraf se daankarta talash karne ke liye har mumkin koshish kar rahe hai
 “sehore is not the only district where the Deendayal Rasoi Yojana is dying
 khargun main dinadayal rasoi ko prakaash smriti seva santhaan chalaa aa rahaa he
 Vikram Singh Chauhan, the manager of this institute, says, "since the inception of the scheme, we have spent eight lakh rupees till now but nothing was received in return
 ham zyada der tak ise nahin chalaa sakate
 If our money is not released, we will close it in March
 ”dinadayal rasoi yojana kii aisi hi badahaali muraina, bhind or alirajpur jilon main bhi dekhne ko mili
 Ghanshyam Botham, manager of the mother Vaishno Devi Bhandar Trust, who runs the kitchen in Morena, said, “some donors came forward when the scheme was launched in April
 lekin ab koi kuch nahin de rahaa, sab kuch apni jeb se hi kharch karnaa pad rahaa he
 If this continues, the kitchen will have to be closed very quickly
 ” bhind main rasoi chalaane vaali sampoorn vikaas seva samiti ke manager lakshmana rajaavat ne bhi aisi hi vyathaa vyakt kii
 Santosh Tehpadia, manager of Deendayal Rasoi in Alirajpur, said that this is a very good scheme for the poor, but it will not last long due to the government not releasing funds
 dinadayal rasoi yojana kii badahaali par vipakshi dal congress ko bhi shivaraj singh chouhan sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhane kaa mauka mil gaya he
 Leader of the Opposition in Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly Ajay Singh said, “it is all very sad
 wo dinadayal upaadhyaay or qatari main khadey aakhri vyakti kii baat karte hai
 And the plan is named Deendayal Rasoi
 
 
 or ab fund kii kami kii vajah se yojana band hone ke kagaar par aa gai he
 The way the scheme is being run is a stain on the face of the government
 ”vahiin shahari vikaas mantri maaya singh kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ne kabhi bhi yojana ke liye paisa dene kaa vaada nahin kiya tha, yojana ko daan kii madad se chalaaya janaa tha
 The minister also claimed that he is not aware that the institutions running the kitchens in many districts are talking about closing them
 mantri ko ye jaankaree nahin lekin sarkaar kii naak ke thik neeche bhopal main dinadayal rasoi ko chalaane vaali ghanashyam seva samiti ke manager abhijit asthana ne kaha, hamane municipal corporation ko chitthee likhi he
 Also, the deadline of 30 November has been kept
 agar hamen is taarikh tak paisa nahin mila to ham rasoi ko band kar denge
 Now it has to be seen that when does Shivraj Sarkar wake up to gain a lot of accolades for himself from the campaign at the beginning of Deendayal Rasoi Yojana? When the last breath is taken, this scheme is corrected, through which it was claimed not to starve anyone

 fredman kii vishwaprasiddh kriti 'da world i
 This Hindi translation of 'J Flat' is a living account of the globalized world of the twenty-first century, depicting the changing global order
 is pustak ko padhakar samajhne ke liye thodaa itihaas main peeche janaa hoga, jab soviet rus bazaar kii takaton kii aandhi main bikhar gaya tha
 The then era male Mikhail Gorvachev was perhaps the biggest character to change the balance of power in the world
 us vakt kii sachaai yah maani ja rahi thi ki duniyaan ek dhruviya ho gai he or vah ekmaatr dhruv tha america
 No one could question America's global monopoly and dominance
 yah sab do dashak tak chalaa bhi
 But now the next page in history is turning back
 yah pustak usee agle panne kaa byora he
 The world is now flat and many new and effective players in the flat world are challenging American economic dominance
 pramukh rup se do asian mahashaktiyaan bharat or china
 Perhaps in the light of this challenge, Friedman is seeking to inspire America to reinvent itself, and is also suggesting how America must change its lifestyle
 varsh 2008 kii vishwavyaapee mandi or aarthik sankat ne do alag-alag tarah ke najaare prastut kiye
 On the one hand, it questioned the Western concept of capitalism based on the American-led open market and globalization, while on the other hand it presented the world an example of economic forces that were almost untouched by the effects of the global recession, as China and India
 is mandi ne hi yah avadharana pusht kii ki duniya teji se samtal ho rahi he
 And India will be a new but influential player in this flat world
 lekhak kaa yah kathan ki ''main bharat kii silicon vaili, bangaloru main columbus kii si khoj par aayaa tha'' ek romaanch kii anubhuti detaa he
 It is fitting that when Columbus came to search for India, the wealth he was looking for was things like metal, silk, and coals, which the author considered hardware
 un dinon inhen chizon se amir hua jaataa tha
 But the sources of twenty-first century earnings are software, computer programs, callcenters etc
 pustak main jo buniyadi mudde uthaae gaye hai, ve usee software kii shakti se jude hai
 After all, why has India become important for outsourcing of information technology and services in the US and other industrialized countries? The author's statement has great significance that Columbus reached America under the illusion of India and thought that he was a part of India
 lekin lekhak sachmuch bharat aayaa or use yah america jaisaa hi laga
 This book gives a very succinct explanation of India's software industry's potential and potential
 yah sahi he ki aaj apane software udyog kii kshamta ke kaaran bharat ek vishwastareey khilaadi he or usase america bhi ashankit he
 This is the result of the era of knowledge
 bhale hi america darshanik benjamin franklin ne kaha tha ki gyaan hi satta he
 Today only India proved it
 or isi gyaan satta ne duniya ko samtal banaaya
 The author has divided globalization into three eras
 pehla daur 1492 se 1800 tak kaa, jab columbus ne apni yatra ke jariye nai or puraani duniya ke bich paraspar vyapaar kaa rasta kholaa
 The second round is considered by the author from 1800 to 2000, with the powers unifying the world primarily being multinationals
 vaishvikaran kaa teesraa daur vartmaan daur he, jisamen software or digital takanic ne bahut-se nae khilaadiyon ko vishwa str par prabhaavshaalee bana diya
 The author has given several tips for the US to make it possible to survive in the global competition
 mukhya rup main kriyasheeltaa or kalpanashiltaa badhaane par bal dene kii baat karte hue lekhak ne america ko ek baar phir se apane soch main badlaav laane or is sachaai ko swikaarne kii hidaayat di he ki duniya ab gol nahin
 An interesting and very factual book
 aaj ke yug kii ek ankhon dekhi daastaan
 But its artificial translation has kept the entire book fun

 In such a situation, the website can easily identify all the smartphones connected to the Internet

 According to the researchers, the third party script on the website links your website visit in a few seconds to the website based on your battery information
 aapke apadet interval ek hone kii vajah se aapke dwaara kholi gai sabhi websiton kii reading ek jaisi hogi
 This is a problem that neither an anti virus nor a firewall can solve

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who won Team India in close matches with his batting in difficult conditions on several occasions, said that the last ball thrown by Zimbabwean fast bowler Neville Medjiva was very good
 bharat ko aakhri gend par chaar ranon kii jarurat thi, lekin dhoni sirf ek ran bana sake
 After India's two-run defeat, Dhoni said, 'in the end, the match is with the ball and bat
 meraa maananaa he ki aakhri gend behtareen thi
 ' match ke baad har koi is kadar chaunkaa hua tha ki puraskaar vitaran samaaroh main bharat ke purv tej gendbaaj atul vaasan ne greem krimar ko parajeet captain kah daalaa, lekin us samay sharminda ho gaye jab mahendra singh dhoni aage aae
 Dhoni said the match was a good lesson for his inexperienced batsmen
 unhone kaha, 've apni kshamta ke anuroop nahin khele
 Many wickets fell irresponsibly
 aap gharelu circuit par acha kar sakate hai, lekin bharat-e se bharat ke liye khilne main kaaphi dabaav hota he
 It was a good lesson for him
 ballebaajon ne kai galtiyaan kii
 We did not field our strong and experienced batting lineup in batting, the bowlers also failed to meet expectations
 ' tippaniyan Zimbabwe captain Graeme Kramer said that the win has put a burden on him

 bharat kii do ran se haar ke baad dhoni ne kaha, 'aakhir main to muqabla gend or balle kaa he
 i believe the last ball was the best
 ' After the match, everyone was so shocked that former India fast bowler Atul Vasan called Graeme Kramer the defeated captain at the prize distribution ceremony, but was embarrassed when Mahendra Singh Dhoni came forward
 dhoni ne kaha ki yah match unke anubhavheen ballebaajon ke liye acha sabak rahaa
 He said, 'they did not play to their potential
 kai wicket gaiyr jimmedaarana tareeke se gire
 You can do well on the domestic circuit, but there is a lot of pressure to play for India from india-a
 yah unke liye acha sabak rahaa
 The batsmen made many mistakes
 hamane ballebaaji main apni majboot or anbhavi batting linep nahin utaari, gendbaaj bhi apekshaaon par khare nahin utar sake

 jab may main america raashtrapati donald trump or uttar korea ke marshall kim jong un kii mulaakaat hogi
 But know one truth before this meeting
 pichley saat saal se kim jong un uttar korea kii satta par qaabiz he
 But in these seven years, he never met the head of any country
 pichley 17 varshon main wo ek baar bhi uttar korea se baahar nahin niklaa yani 17 saalon se wo apane hi mulk main kaid he
 Kim Jong, who is not out of North Korea, has never been out of North Korea for those last 17 years
 pichley saat varshon se wo kisi rashtradhyaksh se nahin mila
 He never went to speak in the United Nations
 use kabhi kisi ne global summit main nahin dekha
 He has never traveled abroad while being the Head of State of Korea
 duusare desh main jane se darataa he kimadrasal, use apane mulk se baahar nikalate hue dar lagata he
 He is afraid of going to another country
 jaanate hai kyon? kyonki uskaa vaaris abhi bahut chota he
 And until he is able to take the throne, he does not want to risk his life
 uttar korea ke taanashaah marshall kim jong kii is hakeekat ko saamne rakh kar hi ye ashanka jataai ja rahi he ki may main donald trump se mulaakaat karne ke liye wo desh se baahar jayega bhi bia nahin?switzraland ke skool main kii padhaaiye bahut kam log hi jaanate honge ki apane hi desh main kaid rahane vaale kim jong un ne schuli padhai switzaraland se kii he
 Kim Jong Un studied at an international school near Bern, the capital of Switzerland, changing her name and identity
 skool ke record ke mutabik 1993 se 98 tak chol paak ke naam se wo skool main padhaa karata tha
 His bodyguards were always around him in disguise as a senior student to protect shy moods and basketball enthusiasts Kim Jong Un
 aisa mana jaataa he ki san 2001 tak kim jong un switzaraland main rahaa or phir korea waapas lautakar kim il sang uniwarsity se aage kii padhai puri kii
 That is, Kim went to Korea for almost 17 years and never went outside the country again
 koi nahin jaanata kim kii janmatithikim jong un ke pita kim jong il ne hameshaa apane bete ko duniya kii nazaron se chupa kar rakhaa
 Perhaps this is why no one knows the exact date of Kim's birth
 bas ye mana jaataa he ki wo 8 janvari ko paidaa hua
 But it happened in 1982
 83 main hua yaa 84 ye kisi ko nahin maaloom
 Kim Jong Il brought this son to the world for the first time when he gave her the first official post in the cabinet, with Neys trying to prepare Kim for his illness
 china or rus hai dost, phir bhi nahin kiya daurasaal 2011 se uttar korea kii kaman kim jong un ke haathon main hai
 And since the occupation of power, it took so long to fulfill its craze of deadly weapons that it did not care about any country or any ban
 is bich na to isse kisi duusare desh ke rashtradhyaksh kii mulaakaat hui or naa hi ye kisi rashtradhyaksh se mila
 China and Russia have been described as friends of North Korea, but Kim Jong-un never traveled to these countries
 saal 2015 main china baqayada kim ko nimantran bhi diya magar usne vahaan jane se inkaar kar diya
 Kim's father-in-law traveled to Russia by train
 In 2015, Kim Jong's visit to Russia was also planned
 lekin baad main use roosi sarkaar ke pravaktaa ne ye kehete hue radd kar diya ki kim apane desh se baahar nahin aana chaahate
 Kim Jong Un's father Kim Jong-il is said to have visited Russia and China, but he also rode the train instead of the flight
 media report main suraksha kaarnon ke alaava hameshaa ye kayaas laga gaya ki kim jong un ye nahin chahta ki uski gaiyr maujuudagi main koi or netaa uttar korea main koi bada faisla le
 Diplomatic relations with 26 countries: North Korea has diplomatic relations with 26 countries in the world, including India
 haalanki bharat main bhi uttar korea kaa koi shaasha aaj tak nahin aayaa
 The reason is that Kim Jong does not even like to talk to the supreme leaders of those other countries
 kai baar duusare deshon ke netaaon ne jab kim se baat karne kii koshish kii to wo bhi safal nahin hue
 Even during the Winter Olympics, he had put forward his sister to talk to South Korea
