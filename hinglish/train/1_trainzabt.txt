 Banks have demanded that the 40 million US dollars that were received from the Diego deal be deposited in the registry of the Supreme Court
 supreme court kaa aadesh sarkaar ke euke se pratyarpan main bhi madad karegaa
 During the hearing, the Supreme Court had asked Mallya whether the information you had given about your properties in the court is correct or not? Have you violated the order of Karnataka High Court? Because the Karnataka High Court had said in its order that Mallya cannot do any transaction without the permission of the court
 supreme court ne centre sarkaar se poocha tha ki maalya ke khilaaf court ke aadesh ko kaise lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 The central government told the Supreme Court that efforts were being made to bring back Mallya
 vahiin SBI ne supreme court ko bataaya tha ki maalya ke upar 9200 karod rupee kaa bakaayaa he
 Banks said - Mallya's petition should not be heard, because he is repeatedly violating the court order
 vijay maalya ne court main kaha tha ki unke paas itane paise nahin he ki ve 9200 karod rupee bank ke karz ko adaa kar paaen, kyonki unki sabhi sampatiyon ko pehle hi jabt kar liya gaya he
 Vijay Mallya said in the Supreme Court that whatever property he had was confiscated
 ab unke paas paise nahin hai
 Vijay Mallya said that the bank which has seized his assets worth Rs 2000 crore, the bank can sell it if he wants
 supreme court kingfisher airlines ke mukhiya vijay maalya ke khilaaf bainkon kii daayar yachika par sunwaayee kar rahaa tha

 agar vah paise ko waapas bharat nahin laate to vyaktigat taur par court main pesh hon
 The comments bainkon ne supreme court ko bataaya ki diego deal se mili 40 million dollar ko bacchon ke acount main transfar kiya he or uskaa ek trust bana rakhaa he

 bainko ne diego deal se mili 40 million america dollar ko supreme court main jamaa karaane kii maang kii thi
 Earlier, on the petition of Vijay Mallya, the court issued notice to the banks and sought reply
 yachika main maalya ne avmaananaa notice ko waapas lene kii maang kii thi
 Mallya says that the details of the property were given for settlement, while the agreement is not being done
 lihaaja koi avmaananaa kaa maamla nahin banataa
 In fact, the Supreme Court is hearing a contempt of court case against Vijay Mallya, the head of Kingfisher Airlines
 SBI or bainkon ne supreme court main adaalat kii avmaananaa kii yachika daakhil kii he jis par court ne maalya ko notice jari kar poocha tha ki kyon naa unke khilaaf avmaananaa kaa mukadmaa chalaaya jaae ? The petition of the banks stated that on the order of the Supreme Court, Mallya gave the details of the property in the seal cover, it is wrong
 AG ne court ko kaha ki maalya ne is diclaration main kai jaankariyaan chhipaai, jhooth bolaa he
 Mallya has also hidden a cash transaction of 2500 crores which is a contempt of court order
 darasal court ke aadesh par maalya ne desh videshi apni sampatti kaa byoraa daakhil kiya tha
 Earlier, in the case of banks not repaying the loan of about Rs 9000 crore, the court issued notice to Mallya and sought the answer
 sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne maalya se poocha tha ki aapane jo court main apni sampatiyon ke bare main jaankaree di thi wo sahi he yaa nahin ? kya aapane karnataka hai court ke aadesh kaa ulanghan to nahin kiya ? kyonki karnataka hai court ne apane aadesh main kaha tha ki maalya bina court ke anumati koi bhi tranjection nahin kar sakate
 The Supreme Court had asked the central government how the court order could be enforced against Mallya
 centre sarkaar ne supreme court ko bataaya ki maalya ko waapas laane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 At the same time, SBI had told the Supreme Court that Mallya owes Rs 9200 crore
 baikon ne kaha- maalya kii yachika par sunwaayee nahin honi chahie, kyonki vah baar-baar court ke aadesh kaa ulanghan kar rahe hai
 Vijay Mallya had said in the court that he does not have enough money to pay the bank loan of Rs 9200 crore, as all his assets have already been confiscated
 vijay maalya ne supreme court main kaha unke paas jo bhi sampatti he vah jabt kii ja chuki he
 Now they have no money
 vijay maalya ne kaha ki jo 2000 karod kii unki sampatti ko bank ne jabt kii he, bank chaahe to use bech saktaa he
 The Supreme Court was hearing a petition filed by banks against Kingfisher Airlines chief Vijay Mallya
 sunwaayee main bainkon ne supreme court se maang kii thi or kaha tha ki court kingfisher airlines ke mukhiya vijay maalya ko aadesh de ki vah diego deal se mili 40 million yues dollar ko ek hafte ke bheetar use bharat lekar aae
 If he does not bring the money back to India, he should appear in court in person
 tippaniyan Banks told the Supreme Court that they had transferred $ 40 million from the Diego deal to the children's account and maintained a trust
 SBI or duusare bainkon ne supreme court se maang kii or kaha ki maalya ne karnataka hoicourt ke aadesh kaa ulanghan kar diego deal se mili 40 million dollars ko bacchon ke acount main transfar kiya he
 Banco had demanded the submission of US $ 40 million from the Diego deal to the Supreme Court
 isse pehle vijay maalya kii yachika par court ne bainko ko notice jari kar jawaab maanga tha
 In the petition, Mallya demanded the withdrawal of the contempt notice
 maalya kaa kahana he ki sampatti kaa byoraa samjhaute ke liye diya tha jabaki samjhauta nahin ho rahaa he
 So there is no contempt case
 darasal, supreme court kingfisher airlines ke mukhiya vijay maalya ke khilaaf adaalat kii avmaananaa ke maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 SBI and banks have filed a contempt petition in the Supreme Court, on which the court issued a notice to Mallya asking why not be tried for contempt against him? bainkon kii yachika main kaha gaya he ki supreme court ke aadesh par maalya ne sil cover main sampatti kaa byoraa diya, vah galat he
 The AG told the court that Mallya hid many information, lied in this declaration
 maalya ne 2500 crores ke cash kaa len dein bhi chipaaya he jo court ke aadesh kii avmaananaa he
 Actually, on the court's order, Mallya had filed the details of his property overseas

 kohli totally deserved it keep going kid a photo posted by Yuvraj Singh (@yuvisofficial) on Apr 3, 2016 at 10:33am PDT The Union Government will not cancel Article 371, the Ministry of Home Affairs said the reports were wrong and baseless
 The reports related to the imposition of Article 371 of the Constitution in Jammu and Kashmir have been denied by the Home Ministry
 grih mantralay ke pravaktaa kaa kahana he ki kuch media reports kah rahi hai ki grih mantralay ne jammu kashmir main anuchhed 371 ko lagu karne kaa prastaav diya he
 Such reports are false and baseless
 darasal daawa kiya ja rahaa tha ki jaise centre sarkaar ne jammu-kashmir ke liye bane vishesh upbandh anuchhed 370 ko ek jatke main khatm kar diya, vaise hi anuchhed 370 ko hataa diya jayega
 However, Home Minister Amit Shah has several times rejected such claims
 loksabhaa main bhi grahamantri yah bol chuke hai ki is anuchhed ko nahin hataaya jayega
 Certain media reports stating that Ministry of Home Affairs has moved a proposal to implement Article 371 in Jammu & Kashmir are incorrect and baseless
 @hmoindia@pib_india@ddnewslive@airnewsalerts@diprjk— Spokesperson, Ministry of Home Affairs (@pibhomeaffairs)december 14, 2019isse pehle sansad main jab 370 par bahes ke dauraan chah agast ko anuchhed 371 kaa bhi mudda uthaa to bahes ke dauraan grih mantri amit shah ne kai tark ginaae the ki kyon sarkaar is anuchhed ko nahin hataanaa chaahati
 Amit Shah made an argument that Article 370, like 370, does not promote separatism in the states
 amit shah ne yah bhi tark diya tha ki 371 e ke tahat nagaland ke naagaon kii dharmik, saamaajik prathaon, bhoomi or sansadhano aadi ke swaamitv ke liye vahaan kii assembly nirnay karti he
 This article does not impede the unity and integrity of the country
 amit shah ke mutabik, 370 or 371 kii tulana karne kaa matlab desh ko gumraah karnaa he
 What is Article 371? Various provisions of Article 371 are applicable in about 11 states of the country including the Northeast
 is anuchhed kii badaulat centre sarkaar sambandhit rajyon main vikaas, suraksha, saranksha aadi se sambandhit kaam kar sakati
 This article gives special status to the respective states
 maharashtra or gujarat, donon rajyon ke rajyapal ko artical-371 ke tahat ye vishesh adhikaar he ki ve maharashtra ke vidarbha, marathavada or gujarat ke saurashtra or kuccha ke alag vikaas board bana sakate hai
 Equal funds will be given for development work in these areas

 The BJP has fielded former Congress President Sukhdev Bhagat from Lohardaga, one of the most talked about seats in the first phase of elections
 is seat se maujuuda vidhayak sukhdev oktober main congress chhod bhaajapa main shaamil hue the
 Aju candidate Kamal Kishore Bhagat won the 2014 election from Lohardaga seat reserved for Scheduled Tribes
 baad main ek maamle main vidhayak camel kishor ko sajaa hone par is seat par hue upachunaav main congress se sukhdev bhagat jite the
 However, Sukhdev Bhagat switched sides and joined the BJP before the elections
 khaas baat he ki ab lohardaga seat par congress ke purv pradesh adhyaksh kaa muqabla maujuuda pradesh adhyaksh rameshwar uraanv se hoga
 The Congress has given ticket to Rameshwar Oraon from here
 vahiin, ajasu ne yahaan se niru shanti bhagat ko khadaa kiya he
 Neeru is the wife of Kamal Kishore Bhagat, who won from Azu in the 2014 elections
 ajasu ne unhen upachunaav main bhi ladaaya tha magar congress pratyaashee sukhdev bhagat se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 BJP has so far declared candidates for 68 seats out of total 81 in the state
 pehali suchi main bhaajapa ne 52 ummidavaaron ke tikat ghoshit kiye the

 Good morning
 How come Modi be allowed to hold a press conference with party symbol on voting day
 violation of EC guideline
 Will EC react? - ashutosh (@ ashutosh83b) April 30, 2014BJP released manifesto on polling day
 Modi did road show on other polling day and now PC with party symbol today
 will EC react? - ashutosh (@ ashutosh83b) April 30, 2014 Earlier, talking to the media, Modi said that the Congress has accepted defeat
 modi ne kaha, 'maa-bete kii sarkaar ja rahi he
 The country is now voting for a strong government
 ' modi ne gujarat ke matadaataaon se maafee maangate hue kaha ki ve gujarat ko chunaav prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan sirf 18 ghante de paae hai

 Some leaders are saving the chair, some are saving themselves and some are trying to save the Congress
 isse pehle modi ne twit kar kaha ki apane aapako khushnaseeb samajhate hai ki unhen adwani ke loksabhaa kshetra main vot daalane kaa avasar mil rahaa he
 Today we are going to tell the story of a teacher who may have stopped going to school but did not stop teaching children
 uma sharma saharpur main neshnal public skool kii principal hai or pichley 10 saalon se bed par lete hue hi skool chalaa rahi hai
 Uma has been paralyzed for the past several years
 unke chehre or haath ko chhodkar koi bhi ang kaam nahin karata he, baavjood iske unhone kabhi haar nahin maani
 Uma runs the school by lying on the bed and runs the school well, giving all the instructions from the bed itself

 At the same time, after the death of her husband, she was drinking tea in her house that suddenly she got an attack of paralysis and after that she could never get up from the bed till today

 Adityanath's reply on Kanhaiya Speaking on the Kanhaiya case, MP from Gorakhpur, Adityanath said that people have to pay attention on what conditions the court has granted them bail

 The BJP or the government have no antipathy towards anyone

 When it comes to abandoning virginity, most women wait for the right person, while some of the right price
 ji haa, america kii ek medical student elizabeth rene ne apni virginity nilaam karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Let us tell you that earlier, 21-year-old Brazilian student Katrina Migliorini also announced the auction of her virginity
 27 saal kii elizabeth internet ke jariye apni virginity bechengi or unhen ummid he ki ve isse kam se kam 2 karod 43 lakh 84 hajaar rupee kamaayengi
 According to René, 'the main purpose of virginity auction is to earn money
 mujhe apni virginity se koi bhaavnaatmak lagaav na to tha or na he
 So it is very easy for me to do so
 or main kyon aisa na karun? yah paise kamaane kaa damdaar or aasaan tarika he'
 René realizes that for some women, losing virginity is an important moment in life, but for them it is nothing more than just physical change and business
 rene kahati hai, 'sex to sirf sex he'
 Rene has never done sex
 unhen kabhi kisi ne neude avasthaa main bhi nahin dekha or na hi unhone kisi neude purush ko dekha he
 According to him, 'I have dated boys, but not more than two or three months
 meraa kabhi koi bwoyfriend nahin rahaa kyonki mujhe aisa koi nahin mila jisane mujhe is baat kaa yakeen dilaayaa ho ki sex shareerik kasarat se zyada he
 i like boys, but i have no emotional connection with anyone
 main padhai or projects par kaam karti hum
 i like to hang out with friends and that's enough for me '
 rene ke dost to is faisle kaa samarthan karte hai, lekin unke bhai ko yah pasand nahin
 According to René, 'my friends respect my decision
 unhen mujh par bharosa he, lekin mere bhai ko is par aapatti he
 However, it did not make any difference to our relationship
 use pataa he ki main smart hum or use bharosa he ki main yah sab thik se kar paaungi'
 Not only this, René's parents are also with him
 rene kaa ek blog bhi he, jisamen unase log tarah-tarah ke sawaal poochhate hai
 Like 'isn't it prostitution'? 'what kind of doctor would such a girl be'? 'can a virgin prostitute be a feminist'? However, this auction is Rene's website www
 elizabeth-raine
 com on 1 April
 chunki america main veshyavriti gaiyrkanoonee he isliye rene ne australia kaa ek agent dhund liya he jo nilaamee main unki madad karegaa
 Let me tell you that prostitution laws in Australia are more flexible
 rene kaa kahana he ki nilaamee puri tarah se kanoon ke hisaab se hogi
 They will also pay tax on the money received from the auction and donate 35% of the proceeds to charity
 rene america main medical student hai, lekin unhone yah nahin bataaya he ki ve kis college main padhai kar rahi hai
 His face is hidden in the pictures he has uploaded in his blog
 rene kahati hai ki nilaamee main jo jitegaa use unke saath ek aaleeshaan hotel main 12 ghante bitaane ke liye milenge
 During this time, his family will know where he is
 unka kahana he ki agar kisi ko lagata he ki sex ke liye paise chukaane ke baad mujhe usase pyaar ho jayega to use behad niraashaa hogi
 He said, 'I know very well what it is and i will not be emotionally affected by it
 yah van nite stand se zyada kuch nahin he'

 com / w1lf2hx1ma lambey arase se dilli kii gaddi kii raah hindi pattee main bihar se uttar pradesh ke raste hokar guzarati rahi he
 The President of the country was from Bihar till 1962
 ab tak kul 14 pradhanmantriyon main 8 uttar pradesh se chune gaye or aazaadee ke baad 67 saal main saadhe 47 varsh se adhik samay tak unhone desh main raaj kiya
 This time too, from Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi to Arvind Kejriwal and Mulayam Singh Yadav are contesting from Uttar Pradesh
 mayawati pehle hi is rajya se rajyasabha main hai
 In such a situation, there is a strong possibility that the next Prime Minister should again be from this state
 ab inamen banegaa koun, iskaa pataa to hamen may ke duusare pakhwaade main hi chal sakegaa
 Among all the states, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are the two states that send 80 and 40 mps respectively to a total of 543 in the Lok Sabha
 yani kul saansadon kaa yahi koi paanchvaan hissaa in do rajyon se hi aata he
 In the 2009 general elections, BJP got a total of ten seats in Uttar Pradesh and 12 in Bihar
 dilli main bijepi kii aguai vaale endie ko agar sarkaar banane ke liye 272 se zyada siten paane kaa sapana saakaar karnaa he to use in rajyon main apana pradarshan sudhaarna padegaa
 It will have to significantly increase its tally of 22 out of the total 120 seats in both states
 endie ko pashchim bengal, orissa, tamilnadu or kerala sareekhe desh ke purvi or dakshini hisson ke bade rajyon main zyada siten milane kii ummid nahin he
 That is why the battle of the Hindi heartland will largely decide who will become the Prime Minister of the country in mid-may 2014
 india today group-sisero opinian pole ke mutabik, bijepi ko uttar pradesh main 46 (h 4) siten milane kaa anumaan he jabaki bihar main endie ke sahyogiyon ke saath use 22 (h 2) siten milane kii sambhaavna he
 Accordingly, the Congress is projected to win 8 (H2) seats in Uttar Pradesh and 17 (H2) seats with UPA allies in Bihar
 yah surveykshan 29 march se 4 april ke bich bihar or uttar pradesh main kramshah 1,800 or 3,600 logon ke bich kiya gaya
 Both states have seen huge disenchantment with the functioning of the UPA government, and leaders of other parties have shared common signs of the huge rise of bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi
 uttar pradesh main lagbhag aadhe matadaata or bihar main har paanch main se teen matadaata maujuuda sarkaar ke kaamkaaj se naakhush hai
 Both these states used to be Congress strongholds till 1984
 us saal party ne avibhajit uttar pradesh main kul 85 siton main se apratyaashit rup se 83 siten jiti thim
 Similarly, in undivided Bihar, it won 48 seats out of 54
 donon main hi aadhe se zyada vot congress ke hi khate main gaye the
 But by 1998, the Congress had become a mere shadow of its image in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 1998 main donon rajyon main congress ko 6-7 pratishat ke aasapaas hi vot mili
 In Uttar Pradesh, it did not get a single seat and in Bihar also its number could reach only five
 1984 or 1998 ke bich ek ore congress kaa varchasv tutaa to duusari ore bijepi majboot hone lagi
 In 1998, it won 57 seats in Uttar Pradesh (before Uttarakhand was formed) and 20 seats in Bihar (before Jharkhand was formed)
 uskaa vot pratishat badhkar uttar pradesh main 36
 5 and increased to 24 in Bihar
 ab india today group-sisero opinian pole ke mutabik, uttar pradesh or bihar main uske paksh main (sahyogiyon ke saath) kareeb 17 pratishat ke atirikt rujhaan se donon rajyon main bijepi kii siton kaa aankada sarvaadhik pahunch jane kaa anumaan he
 In Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, regional parties also got a large part of the electoral land vacated by the Congress
 masalan, bihar main lalu prasad yadav kii aguai vaale rashtriya janata dal (argedy), nitish kumaar ke netritv vaale janata dal (united) ko or uttar pradesh main mulaayam singh yadav kii samaajawaadee party (sapa) tathaa mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party (bispi) ko laabh hua
 Apart from this, parties with sub-regional mass base also emerged
 masalan, uttar pradesh ke upree doaab hnetra main ajit singh kaa rashtriya lokdal or bihar ke kuch hisson main ramvilas paswan kii lok janashakti party
 The current survey estimates major changes in the base of these regional parties
 uttar pradeshuttar pradesh main 2004 or 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main vot main badi hissedari do badi partiyon sapa or bispi ko mili
 When the period of regionalism started in the Indian elections, these two parties have dominated the Uttar Pradesh for almost a decade and a half
 yah badi ghatana thi kyonki 1991 main hi bispi rajya main panjikrut party bani or sapa 1992 main janata dal se tuutakar bani
 According to the opinion poll opinion, the BJP can make a big dent in the support base of SP and BSP in Uttar Pradesh
 yahaan voton main bijepi kii hissedari 2009 ke 18 pratishat se badhkar 35 pratishat tak ja sakati he
 On the other hand, the vote percentage of Congress is expected to fall but it is only 4
 5 pratishat ghatakar 17 pratishat ho saktaa he
 The bsp's vote share can also fall by 9 percent and after 1996, the BSP, which has gone much ahead of the Congress, can now almost stay close to the Congress both in terms of vote percentage and seats
 is tarah se bispi ko sirf 11 siten milane kaa anumaan he, jo 2009 main use mili 20 siton se kaaphi kam he
 On the other hand, SP can get 18 seats this time as compared to 23 seats in 2009
 bispi ke jati or dharm donon hi shreniyon ke janaadhar main giravat dekhne ko mil sakati he, jabaki bijepi ne apane brahman, rajput or duusari oonchi jatiyon ke janaadhar ko majboot kiya dikhataa he
 It has also extended its support to backward and Dalit castes like Kurmi, Koiri and Jatav
 areldi 2004 se hi hameshaa chunaav se pehle gathjod karata aa rahaa he
 He joined hands with SP in 2004, then BJP in 2009 but later joined alliances with the same party against which he contested
 2009 main areldi ne paanch siten mukhya rup se upree doaab se jeetin
 In this election, it has an alliance with the Congress and its prospects are not very bright
 uttar pradesh kaa bhugolic kshetra duniya ke kareeb 150 deshon se bada he or aabaadi ke maamle main bhi bas paanch desh hi usase bade hai
 About 13 for the sixteenth Lok Sabha here
 4 karod matadaata 1,40,259 matdaan kendron par 10 april se 12 may tak chah charnon main vot daalenge
 According to 2001 census in Uttar Pradesh, Muslim population 18
 5 pratishat he or mujffarnagar main agast-sitambar 2013 main hue dangon ke baad chunavi paridrishy kaaphi pechida ho gaya he
 Because of this, the emphasis on identity politics on religious grounds and the possibilities of strategic voting are being raised
 biharutar pradesh kii donon prabhavi kshetreey partiyon sapa or bispi ne upie sarkaar ko baahar se samarthan diya magar chaturaai se congress yaa bijepi se pradesh main chunaav purv gathjod karne se inkaar kar diya
 But in the case of pre-poll alliances, the two regional nobles of Bihar RJD and JD (U) have a different attitude
 argedy kaa 2004 main congress ke saath or 2009 main algepi ke saath chunaav purv gathjod rahaa
 JD (U) has also had pre-poll alliances with BJP in 2004 and 2009
 bihar kaa chunavi paridrishy teen mahatvapurn ghatnaon kii vajah se talkh ho gaya
 One is that RJD leader Lalu Prasad Yadav was convicted in the fodder scam
 ve jamaanat par chute to lekin chunaav ladgaye se vanchit ho gaye
 He aligned the seats with the Congress and Sharad Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party
 duusare, jedy(you) ne bijepi se dashak bhar kaa naata tod liya or sipii se talmail ke alaava maidan main akele hi sangharsh kar rahi he
 Thirdly, the BJP merged the seats with the LJP and Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP)
 india today group-sisero janamat surveykshan ke anumaan ke mutabik, bihar main siton ke talmail se bijepi or congress donon ko bada phayda milane ja rahaa he
 In 2014, the vote of NDA constituents can almost double to 38 percent and they can get 22 seats
 congress or unki sahyogi argedy kaa vot 6 pratishat tak gir saktaa he, lekin donon ke vot mil jane kii vajah se upie ghatak dalon kii siten 6 se badhkar 17 (h 2) ho sakati hai
 One reason is the meeting of the upper caste base of the Congress with the backward base of the RJD
 jedy(you) ko shaayad apane ek-chauthai vot se haath dhonaa pad saktaa he or use 1 (h 1) seat se santosh karnaa pad saktaa he
 This is despite the fact that Nitish Kumar is the most popular Chief Minister there
 lekin yah loksabhaa kaa chunaav he or narendra modi pradhanmantri pad ke pasandida ummidavaar hai

 pradhanmantri narendra modi shanivaar ko manipur kii rajdhani imphal main ek jansabha ko sambodhit kar rahe hai
 Elections to the 60-member Manipur assembly are scheduled on March 4 and eight
 is chunaav main sattadhari party congress or bijepi ke bich kadi takkar ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 Significantly, Manipur has a Congress for the last 15 years
 pichley chah maheene main congress ke kai varisht sadsy jinamein mantri bhi shaamil hai, ve paala badalakar bijepi main shaamil ho gaye hai
 However, this time BJP is contesting in Manipur without its major coalition partners NPP, NPF and Lok Janshakti Party
 ye sabhi partiyaan alag alag chunaav lard rahi hai
 PM Narendra Modi targeted the current Congress government in the state and said that 'I have been in Delhi for two and a half years but the Chief Minister has been sitting here for 15 years, no work has been done
 koi vikaas kaa kaam nahin hua
 Manipur has been continuously down for 15 years
 dilli main bhi unki sarkaar thi, uske baad bhi manipur ko barabaad kar diya gaya
 ' piem modi ne kaha ki manipur ke kisaanon kaa nuksaan congress ne kiya
 Now Congress does not have the right to stay here even for a day
 ab is baar congress ko puri tarah se saaf karnaa he
 BJP has a strong government for the first time in Delhi
 is sarkaar ne sabase pehle purv bharat ke vikaas kii baat kahi
 Until the development of North East does not happen, the development of India will be incomplete
 prakritik sampada he, log samarthyavan he
 There are people who follow the law
 agar sarkaar do kadam chalati he log 10 kadam daudane ko taiyaar rahete hai
 The PM said that the old Congress government in Uttar Pradesh made the playground of politics
 ek janajati ko duusare se ladaana yah kaam congress ne kiya
 This work is done when elections come, there is no question of development
 isse manipur barabaad hua he
 PM Modi promised to 'give BJP an opportunity to serve once
 hamen paanch saal dijie, unhen 15 saal die hai

 The central government's interest in deciding to give 'bharat Ratna' to Sachin Tendulkar, who is called the God of Cricket, can be understood from the fact that the central government fulfilled all the formalities for deciding to give Sachin the highest civilian honor of the country
 It took just 24 hours to do
 yah khulaasa soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat saamne aae dastavejon se hua he
 Information received under RTI by Hemant Dubey, resident of Betul, Madhya Pradesh, shows that the central government has not only prepared the bio-data of Tendulkar's 24-year journey in just four hours, but also decided to give Bharat Ratna within 24 hours

 Hemant Dubey, a resident of Betul, who is suffering from cancer, said that on 17 July 2013, the Sports Ministry had duly sent a recommendation to the Prime Minister for the Bharat Ratna to Major Dhyanchand, but that recommendation was ignored
 khaas baat yah he ki bharat ratna ke liye khel mantralay ne hockey ke jaadugar major dhyanchand kii sifarish kii thi, lekin piemo ne sachin ke naam ko aage badhaane ke liye dhyanchand ke naam par koi vichaar nahin kiya

 We had raised issues in the public interest which were sidelined

 When asked about his return to Delhi, he said, "I chose today to come to Delhi because emergency was imposed on these days
 ab main desh ke halaat ko aghoshit apatkaal maanata hum
 The incident on the night of June 4 indicates that black money is not deposited abroad by the government and the government-funded people
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki hamaare andolan ko chaar june ko kuchal diya gaya
 "ramdev said," If the issue of bringing back black money was wrong, if our movement was undemocratic and if i am communal then why were we communicated

 In that tape, Sibal gave other assurances, including declaring black money as a national asset
 ’’baharhaal, is mudde par ek anya kaarykram ke itar jab sibbal se pratikriya maangi gayi to mantri ne samvaadadaataaon ke sawaalon kaa koi jawaab nahin diya
 Ramdev said of the allegations of 'escaping' from the Ramlila ground that on the night of June 4 he wanted to arrest him but the police intended to remove him from the road rather than arrest him

 Regarding Hazare's proposed fast on the issue of Lokpal, Ramdev said, "whoever will raise voice against corruption, we will stand with him
" phir chaahe vah kisi bhi party yaa sanghathan kaa ho
 He said that he would have been happy if provisions were made to include trusts and non-governmental organizations as well as the Prime Minister and mps under the Lokpal's purview in the draft government
 ramdev ne unke khilaaf lagaataar bayaan dene vaale congress mahasachiv diggivajay singh kaa naam liye bina kaha, ‘‘mujhe kuch logon ne chor, thag or mahathag kaha, lekin main chup rahaa
 i do not want to get my tongue dirty by reacting to the stubborn comments of such irresponsible people

 lambey samay se purv sainikon kii oropi kii maang ko aakhirkaar sarkaar ne maan liya he
 If sources are to be believed, the role of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is also considered to be important behind the government's activism in this matter
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki 25 agast ko grih mantri rajnath singh ke nivas par ek baithak hui jisamen raksha mantri parrikar or rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal maujuud the
 Indresh Kumar, Krishna Gopal and Arun Kumar were present on behalf of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 baithak main sangh kii ore se kaha gaya ki bina kisi der ke oropi kii ghoshnaa kar di jaae
 If sources are to be believed, then the delegation of RSS ex-servicemen council met Mohan Bhagwat, the head of the Sangh where he was assured that the government would be asked to resolve the matter at the earliest
 khabar he ki 2 sitambar yani aresas samanvay baithak ke pehle din bhaiyaji joshi, dattatreya hosbhole ne amit shah, arun jetali, sushamaa swaraj, parrikar or rajnath singh ke saath alag se mulaakaat kii jisamen ek baar phir sarkaar se is masale ke jald niptaare ke liye kaha gaya
 The RSS said that economic and administrative methods can be worked out later under a due process

 bihar daure par pradesh kii rajdhani patna main congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi ne kaha he ki raaj va uddhav thakare se unka koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 During the press conference, Rahul Gandhi tried to explain that he did not target Uddhav Thackeray in the last speech
 unhone kaha ki unhen sirf bharat kii chintaa he
 Rahul Gandhi said that he is against the ideology of those parties which stop North Indians in Maharashtra
 unhone kaha ki agar uttar bharatiyon ko kahin roka gaya, to ve chup nahin rahenge
 It is worth mentioning that on Monday, during the address to the students in Darbhanga, Bihar, Rahul Gandhi had said that the Shiv Sena and MNS should not forget that many of the NSG commandos who had defeated the terrorists in the terror attack were from UP and Bihar Were
 is par shivasena ke mukhpatr saamana main chape ek lekh main uddhav thakare ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ne mumbai hamale ke dauraan enesji main shaamil bihar or upi ke javaanon kaa zikr kar un veeron kaa apmaan kiya he, jo aatanki hamale main shahid ho gaye
 Kiran Bedi, an important member of Team Anna, has said that a BJP government should be formed at the Center and it is better if the next Prime Minister of the country is Narendra Modi
 yah pehla mauka he jab kiran bedi ne kisi saarvajanik taur par narendra modi kaa samarthan kiya he
 Actually, Kiran Bedi first said these things in a private channel debate
 haalanki baad main ek twit ke jariye modi ko vot dene kaa sawarjanik elaan kar diya
 He tweeted, 'first of all India for me
 sthir, sushasit, prashasit, javabdeh or sabakaa saath
 My vote to Namo as an independent voter
 'aapako bataa den ki ek tivi dibet ke dauraan kiran bedi ne kaha tha, 'hamen do rashtriya partiyon ke bich chunanaa he
 Shall we choose the party that is in power right now, which scandalized scams in the last 9 years
 yaa phir duusari rashtriya party ko chune jiskaa netritv ek prashaasak kar rahaa he jo lagaataar teen baar gujarat kaa mukhyamantri bana
 Arvind Kejriwal is honest but he does not have the experience of running the government at the Center nor does he have the number
 main sthirataa kii vakaalat karti hum or agar modi ke aane se aisa hota he to main iske paksh main hum
 Kiran Bedi's statement is also important because there are reports in the media that former Army Chief General VK Singh may join BJP soon
 vahiin, dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal jo kabhi team anna main kiran bedi ke saath the, par team anna ke tut jane ke baad donon ke raste puri tarah se alag ho gaye hai
 It is also worth noting that Kejriwal also sent an invitation to Kiran Bedi to attend her swearing-in, but she did not come
 dilli kaa bijepi yuva morcha bhi mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke khilaaf maidan main utar gaya he

 dilli bijepi pradesh yuva morcha adhyaksh sunil yadav or pradesh upaadhyaksh jai prakaash ke saath yuva morcha kaaryakarta is havan main shaamil hue
 State BJP vice-president Jai Prakash alleged that there is resentment among the youth by Kejriwal's habits
 aaj kaa yah havan kaarykram isliye kiya gaya he taaki yuvaaon se jo vaade kejariwal ne kiye the wo unhen puraa karen
 He said that through Havan, prayers for goodwill were also offered for the four Chief Ministers who supported the politics of Kejriwal's dharna in the LG Secretariat
 yuva morcha ne kejariwal se maang kii he ki vah hadtaal chhodkar dilli kii janata kii seva main waapas lauten
 Before the NITI Aayog meeting in Delhi, Chief Ministers of non-bjp ruled states met Kejriwal's family and urged Modi to resolve the issue
 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee, andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri en chandrababu naidu, karnataka ke mukhyamantri ech di kumaraswami or kerala ke mukhyamantri pinaraayi vijayan ne centre se turant 'sankat' kaa samaadhaan karne ko kaha tha
 However, during the havan, Yuva Morcha president Sunil Yadav said that the biggest hand behind Kejriwal's success in 2015 was the youth of Delhi, but after three and a half years, the young CM is not happy with the positive attitude
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki dilli sarkaar dwaara khel kud parisaron ke vikaas or vaai-faai jaise muddon par koi kaam nahin karne se yuva varg kejariwal se naaraaz he
 Raitadasri will distribute near CM residence, Delhi BJP OBC Morcha president Gaurav Khari said that Raita will be distributed near CM residence at 11 am on Tuesday in protest against Kejriwal's way of doing politics
 uparajyapal karen mukademabijepi akali vidhayak manjinder singh ne kaha, unhone uparajyapal anil baijal se kejariwal ke khilaaf mukadmaa karne kii guzarish kii he
 If he does not, then BJP will sue him

 jab world twanti 20 main duniya ke sabase behtareen khilaadi khilne utrenge to tii 20 ke kuch record to tuutane lagbhag tay hi hai
 But the fun will come when someone breaks Yuvraj Singh's record of scoring 36 runs in an over
 kaise tuutegaa ek over main 36 ran kaa record?yuvarajane pehle world twanti 20 main stuart broad kii 6 gendon par 6 chakke jadkar yah record banaaya tha
 Breaking this record is not a joke, but not impossible either
 2012 main africa pesar vyne paranel ne aath gendon kaa ek over phenkaa tha, jisamen do no ball thim
 England's Jose Butler had scored 32 runs in this over
 isi tarah ek yaa do no ball milane par ek over main 36 se bhi zyada ran banaae ja sakate hai
 Some such records which are very difficult to break but not impossible
 
 
 sabase bada team score1 over main 6 chakke kii tarah yah record bhi pehle world tii 20 main bana tha
 Sri Lanka made 260, batting first against Kenya
 srilankai ballebaajon ne chaukon-chhakkon kii barsaat kar di thi
 This innings had 30 fours and 11 sixes
 jawaab main kenyayi team sirf 88 ranon par dher ho gai thi
 To understand how difficult it is to break this record, know that for this, more than 13 runs will have to be scored in each over
 jarur padhein: kabhi nahin tootenge cricket ke ye 10 records!12 gendon main ardhashatakayuvraj sinhane yah karnama 2007 main apni 6 chakke vaali pari main hi banaaya tha
 This record cannot be broken even by hitting a four on each ball
 isliye tii 20 international main koi ballebaaj is record ke paas bhi nahin pahunchaa
 Chris Gayle made 12 balls in the Big Bash League earlier this year
 lekin big bash ke records kii ginati tii 20 international main nahin hoti
 4 overs, 8 runs and 6 wickets were the magical bowling figures given by Sri Lankan spinner Ajanta Mendis in the 2012 World Twenty20
 mendis ne zimbabwe ke khilaaf 4 main se 2 over to madan karaae the
 Due to Mendis' magical bowling, the entire team of Zimbabwe was all out for 100 runs
 mendis kaa record todna to dur, abhi tak koi doosraa gendbaaj twanti 20 international main ek pari main 6 wicket bhi nahin le paaya
 156 runs in an innings was done by Aaron Finch of Australia in 2013
 finch ne sirf 63 gendon par 156 ran banaae the
 In this innings, he hit 14 sixes and 11 fours
 finch twanti 20 international main 150 kaa aankada paar karne vaale akele batsman hai
 In the list of batsmen who played the biggest innings, after Finch, he is the only Shane Watson of his country, who scored 124 not out against India in January
 ek match main 467 ran40 over main 467 ran
 This record was made for South africa-australia matches
 africa team ne apane homeground new wanderrs stadium main pehle batting karte hue 231 ran banaae the, lekin australia ne chaar gend baaki rahete hue lakshya hasil kar liya tha
 There were 44 fours and 24 sixes in 40 overs
 vaise, yah world twanti 20 kaa match nahin tha
 Former Australian leg-spinner Carrie o'keefe believes that Steve Smith does not have the temerity of captaining Australia and has made a mole of palm on several occasions in the Test series against India
 australia yah siries 2-1 se haar gaya or smith ne kai maukon par bhaawanaaon main bahane ke liye maafee bhi maangi thi
 smithokief is the emotional captain, Smith believes that he captained with complete honesty, but he is very emotional for such a pressure work
 kairi okif ne kaha, 'vah morche se aguwai karata he lekin hamaari team kaa captain hone ke liye kya uske tevar sahi hai
 Probably not because she is very emotional
 maidan par kai baar usne har baat par pratikriya vyakt kii
 'australian media attack,' Kohli's behavior as childlike and levelless' Smith was caught by the camera abusing him after Murali Vijay claimed to have taken a catch
 is par okif ne kaha ki vah kaich bhale hi saaf nahin tha, lekin us par smith ko apshabd nahin kahana chahie
 This shows that he gets very emotional in a situation of pressure
 koun he kairi okif?kairi okif ne australia ke liye 24 test or do vanade match khele
 o'keefe of New South Wales began his career against England in January 1971 in Melbourne
 24 test maichon main unhone 38
 Took 53 wickets at an average of 07
 is dauraan 101 ran dekar paanch wicket unka sarvshereshth pradarshan rahaa
 Kangaroo's mind game, advocating Rahane as captain Amazon Firestick yuj karte hai to aapke liye yah buree khabar se kam nahin he
 Because youtube has ended support prematurely
 isse pehle google ne kaha tha ki 1 janvari 2018 se Amzon Firestick par utyub nahin chalegaa
 For some users, it has been blocked from today
 haal hi main google or amejon main tanaav kii vajah se google ne utyub ko amejon prime se hataane kaa faisla kiya tha
 Since then, Amazon Prime Video customers have been given a message on Fire TV that from January 1, 2018, you will not be able to watch youtube on Amazon Fire Stick
 amejon fire stick yujar ke liye yah gambhir he, kyonki hamaare kai yujar fire stick par utyub dekhte hai
 Since Amazon knows that removing youtube from Fire Stick will reduce customers
 isliye company ne ek kaat nikaali he jisase utyub kaa saport khatm hone ke baavjood fire stick ke jariye utyub dekh sakate hai
 Amazon has said from The Verge, "youtube and millions of other websites can be opened through web browsers like Firefox and Silk"
 Now one thing is clear from this statement that youtube will stop working, but customers will still keep youtube content Will be able to see on the fire stick
 haal hi main amejon fire stick ke liye firefox broujar launch kiya gaya he
 You can watch youtube through this
 iske alaava doosraa broujar silk he jiske jariye bhi utyub dekha ja saktaa he
 Amazon has now adopted a method
 fire stick par jaise hi utyub open karenge aapako firefox / silk broujar par utyub open karne kaa opshan dikhegaa or yahaan se aap utyub ke contant dekh sakate hai

 Let us tell you that John Abraham was not the first choice of the makers

 John will do several workshops for about 15 to 20 days before the shoot

 John will also study the state of things of the time of 1971
 ve kadi training lenge
 Mental condition is very important for such a role and John's commitment is very good

 1951 main assam main shuru hui thi NRC kii pehali prakriya1971 ke baad assam main bade paimaane par aae avaidh apravastysam ke alaava dilli, telugana, bengal main bhi uthi NRC kii maissam main enarasi kii aakhri list jari hone ke baad 19 lakh logon ke saamne pahchaan kaa sankat paidaa ho gaya he
 These numbers are of those who are not named in the final list of NRC
 enarasi yani ki neshnal register of citigens
 This is a government document that tells which people living in Assam are Indians and who are not? In simple language, NRC is the process through which the foreigners living illegally in the country try to find them
 
 desh ke grih mantri amit shah ne aise avaidh logon ko desh se baahar karne kaa vaada kiya he
 The country's first NRC NRC has its roots in Nehru's rule, the British Raj, the Partition of India, the riots after independence, the Bangladesh liberation struggle
 lekin desh kaa pehla neshnal register of citigens bharat ke pehle pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru ke netritv main 1951 main assam main bana tha
 In 1905, British power partitioned Bengal in their own interest
 angrejon ne purvi bengal or assam ke rup main naye rajya kaa gathan kiya
 In 1947, when the partition of the country was taking place, there was a fear among the people of Assam that Assam should not be separated from the country by linking it with East Pakistan
 assam ke netaa gopinath bardoloi ke netritv main assam main vidroh shuru ho gaya
 After independence, a large number of people from the erstwhile East Pakistan and present Bangladesh started coming to Assam
 desh kii aazaadee ke baad bantwaare kii vajah se kai ilaake dange or hinsa ke daur se guzar rahe the
 During this time, a large number of people came from East Pakistan in Assam
 assam main inkaa virodh shuru hua or jald hi yahaan par kanoon-vyavastha kii samasya paidaa ho gai
 The then Nehru government initiated the process of the first National Citizenship Register (NRC) in Assam to separate illegal immigrants from East Pakistan from Indian citizens
 enarasi register banane se pehle janaganana kaa kaam shuru hua or janaganana ke aankade se hi rashtriya naagarikta register taiyaar kiya gaya
 On 9 February 1951, the census process was started
 ise puraa karne ke liye 20 din kii samaysima di gai
 On 9 February 1951, the then Chief Minister of Assam, BR Medhi, while addressing a group of employees going to start the census, said that the census data they are collecting will create the first National Register of Citizens of the Republic of India
 janaganana form main 14 sawaal the jinamein se 11 sawaalon ke jawaab se NRC taiyaar kiya gaya
 24 March 1971 is the fixation of the NRC
 After almost 70 years, Assam is updating the NRC once again
 nishchit rup se ye prakriya raajnneetik, saamaajik or naagarikta pahchaan se jude kai vivaadon kii vajah ban gai he
 The date given as the deadline to join this new NRC list was 24 March 1971
 jo log 24 march 1971 kii aadhi raat se pehle bharat main pravesh kar chuke the ve is suchi main shaamil ho sakate the
 Please tell that on 25 March 1971, the Bangladesh War had started
 iske baad lakhon kii sankhya main bangladeshi naagarik bharat main aane shuru ho gaye the
 India is certainly not ready to accept them as its citizens
 1961 ke baad teji se badi assam kii aabaadidarasal 1951 se 1961 ke bich assam kii aabaadi 36 fisadi bad gai thi
 Whereas between 1961 and 71, the population of Assam grew by 35 per cent
 iske liye yudhgrast purvi pakistan se sharnaarthiyon kii aamad ko jimmedaar mana gaya
 The national growth rate of the population in these decades was 22 and 25 percent
 NRC suchi main naam check karte log (photo-api)1971 main jab bangladesh mukti sangram shuru hua to assam main avaidh apravasiyon kii baadh aa gai
 According to an India Today report, between 1971 and 1991, Assam saw an increase of 89 per cent of the electorate, while between 1991 and 2011, 53 per cent of the voters increased in Assam
 15 agast 1985 ko rajeev gandhi ne kiya assam samjhautis bich assam asthirataa ke daur se gujarata rahaa
 Peace was established in Assam on August 15, 1985 when the Rajiv Gandhi government entered into an Assam pact with agitators seeking to expel illegal immigrants from the state
 iske tahat 1951 se 1961 ke bich assam main aae sabhi logon ko naagarikta di gai or unhen vot dene kaa adhikaar diya gaya
 People from Assam were given citizenship between 1 January 1961 and 24 March 1971, but were not given the right to vote
 25 march 1971 ke baad aae logon ko waapas bhejne kaa faisla liya gaya
 So far, four drafts of NRC have been issued and in 2015 the process of updating NRC started after the intervention of the Supreme Court
 kai padaav se guzarane ke baad 31 disambar 2017 ko NRC kaa pehla draft prakashit hua
 3 in it
 29 karod logon main se keval 1
 9 crores was considered a legitimate citizen of India
 30 july 2018 ko assam sarkaar ne doosraa draft jari kiya
 2 in total
 89 karod logon ko vaid naagarik mana gaya
 In this way, a total of about 40 lakh people were left out of the NRC list
 26 june 2019 ko ek or list jari kii gai
 After the arrival of this list, about 1 lakh 2 thousand people were also excluded from NRC
 iske baad NRC se baahar hue logon kii taadaad 41 lakh 10 hajaar ho gai
 The last list of NRC was finally released on August 31, 2019
 is list ke mutabik 19 lakh se zyada log NRC kii suchi se baahar hai
 The NRC figures have always been under the shadow of political controversy
 jaise hi assam ke aankade saamne aae desh ke kai rajyon main NRC kii maang hone lagi
 Delhi Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari said that the NRC process should be started in Delhi too as a large number of intruders have settled in Delhi
 teluganatelagana se bijepi vidhayak raja singh ne telugana main NRC banane kii maang kii he
 Raja Singh tweeted that he appealed to the Ministry of Home Affairs to implement NRC in Telangana as well
 raja singh ne kaha ki hyderabad ke saansad ne anek bangladeshiyon or rohingyaon ko apane vot bank ke liye sharan di he
 To exclude such people, NRC should be implemented with effect from Hyderabad Liberation Day i
e
 17 September
 pashchim bengalbhartiya janata party pashchim bengal main bhi enarasi lagu karne kii maang kar rahi he
 West Bengal BJP President Dilip Ghosh has said that Bangladeshis should be evacuated and NRC should be implemented for internal security of the country
 keralapichley loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne kerala main ek chunavi raily main kaha tha ki unki party kii sarkaar enasi lagu karegi or sabhi ghuspaithiyon ko baahar karegi
 In Mizorammizoram too, all the local parties except Congress are demanding implementation of National Register of Citizens (NRC)
 november main vidhansabha chunaav main sattarudh mizo neshnal front (emenef) ne apane ghoshnaptr main vaada kiya tha ki vah assam kii tarah yahaan bhi enarasi lagu karegi
 At least 28 people were killed and more than 40 injured in a suicide attack on a market in Malakand area of pakistan's restive northwestern region
 pichley kuch samay se aatmghaatee aatankwaadi hamalon se dahale desh main is prakaar kaa yah taaja hamalaa he

 This is the first time in the last three decades that no dacoits or former dacoits have landed in the political battlefield
 itnaa hi nahin wo na to kisi pratyaashee ke liye chunaav prachaar kar rahe hai
 However, before this, Chambal and Vindhya regions of the state have been famous for dacoits
 itnaa hi nahin, kuch dakait to vidhayak banakar surkhiyon main bhi rahe hai
 Let me tell you that in the assembly elections held in 2013, the former dacoit Prem Singh had contested from Chitrakoot seat of Madhya Pradesh's Satna district on the Congress ticket and defeated bjp's Surendra Singh Gaharwar by nearly 10,000 votes
 dasyu jivan se raajnneeti kaa safar karne vaale prem singh is seat se teen baar vidhayak rahe
 He also became an MLA by winning Congress ticket in 1998 and 2003 as well
 madhya pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri evam divangat diggaj congress netaa arjuna singh ke kattar samarthak rahe prem singh kaa lambii biimaar ke baad pichley saal may main nidhan ho gaya tha
 Let me tell you that in the 2013 assembly elections, there were about 39 seats in gwalior-chambal and Vindhya regions where the dacoits either contested or campaigned in favor of a candidate
 lekin is baar puure chunavi sargarmi ke bich nadaarad hai
 Gwalior's philanthropist Dr
 Keshav Pandey said that former robber Malkhan Singh and dacoit Manohar Singh Gurjar, who raged in the ravines of Chambal, campaigned in favor of BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 25 saal se adhik samay tak chambal ghati main aatank machaane ke baad malakhan singh ne kareeb saadhe teen dashak pehle arjuna singh sarkaar ke samaksh aatmasamarpan kar diya tha or ab ve bandook chhod aadhyatmik maarg apana chuke hai
 However, Malkhan Singh, who has a big mustache, contested the panchayat elections in one round and won it
 vah vibhinn raajnneetik dalon se bhi jude rahe hai
 In 1996, he also contested the assembly by-elections on the SP ticket from Bhind, but lost
 malakhan ne empi main congress ke or sapa ke liye uttarapradesh main chunaav prachaar bhi kiya
 In the last two assembly elections, it supported the BJP candidates and also sought votes for them
 vahiin, daaku manohar singh gurjar 90 ke dashak main bijepi main shaamil hue or varsh 1995 main bhind jile kii mehagaanv nagarpalika ke adhyaksh bane
 However, he now runs his own small private business
 vahiin, purv dakait balavant singh ne bataaya ki vah is saal essi / asti act main hue sanshodhan se naaraaz hai, lekin iske baad bhi main kisi raajnneetik dal ko is chunaav main samarthan nahin kar rahaa hum
 Balwant is a relative of well-known dacoit Paan Singh Tomar
 satna ke patrkaar rajesh dvivedi ne bataaya ki prem singh ke nidhan ke baad dakaiton dwaara chunaav ko prabhavit karne or unke dwaara kisi bhi seat se chunaav jeetne kaa yug madhya pradesh main ab khatm ho gaya he
 He said that at present there are two gangs of dacoits in the rugged Vindhya region of the state, including Babli Kaul and Lovelesh Kaul
 haalanki in donon gangon kii raajnneetik akhaade main koi ginati nahin he
 Before Prem Singh, let us tell that the former dreaded dacoit Shiv Kumar Patel alias Dadua used to influence the elections in Chitrakoot of Uttar Pradesh and Vindhya region of Madhya Pradesh
 thik aise hi anya dakait ambika patel urf thokia bhi chunaavon ko prabhavit kiya karata tha
 Dadua's brother Bal Kumar Patel has been an MP from SP, son Veer Singh, MLA, Ram Singh MLA

 There are also 5 crore Indians who may have to wash their hands
 khatre kaa anumaanisse pehle ek adhyayan mensamudri jalastr badhanese jitne logon par khatre kaa anumaan lagaaya tha, usase yah teen guna adhik he
 The threat to the Indian people has already increased seven times
 is naye 'parishkrut' adhyayan ke mutabik, samudr ke badhate jalastr se bharat ko saat guna adhik khatra he jisase 3
 5 crore people will be affected
 haalanki, bhartiya vaigyanikon ne is adhyayan ko chunauti dete hue kaha he ki is adhyayan main khamiyaan hai
 GIS and remote sensing expert Raj Bhagat Palanisamy, who works on urban development and water resources, told India Today, "the estimates of the newly released study and its risks are to be used with caution in the Indian context
 is adhyayan main america or austrailia ke databes ko liya gaya or unheen ke aadhaar par puure vishwa ke sandarbh main istemaal kiya gaya
 It did not include ground data of India
 'vaigyanikon ke adhyayan main khulasaclimet central ke vaigyanik Scott a Kulp or Benjamin h Strauss ke netritv main hue is naye adhyayan main kaha gaya he ki glaciaron ke pighalane se samudr kaa jalastr bad rahaa he
 In India, the houses of people living in the seaside areas can fit in the sea waves
 yah adhyayan nechar communication ne prakashit kiya he
 This study states that people living in coastal areas of India are seven times more at risk than earlier estimates
 samudri jalastr par hue is parishkrut adhyayan main kaha gaya he ki bharat kii 3
 More than 5 crore population is facing danger
 isamen mumbai, kolkata, chennai or kerala ke alaava kuch hissaa gujarat kaa he jo aane vaale 30 saalon main bhayanak khatre kaa saamana karenge
 According to this study, the new estimates are important for Asia and especially India, where the world's second largest population lives
 2050 tak salanaa baadh se khatre kii ashanka bangladesh main aath guna, bharat main saat guna, thailand main baarah guna or china main teen guna tak bad gai he
 What the study says about India: The lower coastal areas of Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai are already in danger
 lekin naye adhyayan main kaha gaya he ki agar carbon utsarjan main kami nahin kii gai to samudri baadh agle tees saalon main naye ilaakon ko bhi apane chapet main le legi
 These cities of India, including parts of Central Kerala and Gujarat, will be flooded at least once a year by 2050
 philhal samudr ke tatavarti ilaakon main 3
 1 crore Indians live, this population 3 by 2030
 5 karod ho jaaegi
 If the study of the us-based think tank comes true, areas from Dadar to Kandivali in Mumbai and Jawaharlal Nehru Port to Kharghar in Navi Mumbai could flow by 2050
 isi tarah aankade kehete hai ki global varming se kolkata or chennai jaise bhartiya mahanagaron ko bhi gambhir khatra he
 Kolkata is more threatened than any other Indian city
 central climet data ke mutabik, nichle ilaakon main based gharon main kareeb 30 fisadi ghar agle 30 saalon main nasht ho jaaenge
 Chennai will have the same effect on global warming
 aankade kehete hai ki mukhya chennai samet kai ahm ilaakon main baadh tabaahi machaa sakati he
 Apart from this, parts of Central Kerala and Gujarat will also be affected
 haalanki, yah anumaan andeh ke ghere main he
 Raj Bhagat told India Today, 'some of the data used in this study are not accurate and do not reflect the ground reality of India
 kai jane maane ilaakon ke liye yah khatre ke anumaan ko badha chadhaakar pesh karata he
 It is better to speculate about this, that our government should study the coastal areas afresh, with the help of which the forwardness can be taken forward
 ' Former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister and Congress stalwart Digvijay Singh has vacated his government bungalow in Bhopal

 'but he made it clear that he was going to negotiate the Delhi merger and his visit had nothing to do with the political stir of Bihar

 Meanwhile, Pakistan Army Chief General Kayani also held a meeting with top commanders
 pakistan america aaropon se bahut naakhush chal rahaa he
 Hina Rabbani Khar has also said in a conversation with NDTV that such statements could cause America to lose one of its key allies in the fight against terrorism
 ek aisi khabar, jo kai kaarnon se dil dahalaati he - isliye, kyonki ek baar phir saaf hua ki koi kitni aasaani se kisi ladki kii zindagi ko tahas-nahas kar saktaa he
 
 
 Also, because it looks like how criminals get punished almost
 
 
 or isliye bhi, kyonki is peedit ladki ko ilaaj ke liye kahin se koi madad nahin mil paa rahi he
 
 
 Nine years ago, Sonali Mukherjee, NCC Captain, college topper, laughing and playing, was a common girl
 
 
 lekin nau saal baad aaj 27 saal kii sonaali kii na sirf zindagi badal chuki he, balki cheharaa bhi buree tarah bighad gaya he, uski donon ankhon kii roshni ja chuki he, or sharir kaa shaayad hi koi hissaa aisa ho, jo jala na ho
 Sonali has been in Delhi for a week
 uski do hi maangen hai - yaa use insaaf mili yaa ichhamrityu
 
 
 It is difficult to put Sonali's painful story into words, but in a conversation with NDTV India, she told the bitter truth of her life
 jharkhand ke dhanbad kii sonaali ke mutabik vah 22 april, 2003 kii raat thi, jab uske pados ke teen ladakon ne uske ghar aakar us par tezaab phenk diya
 Splashes of acid also fell on his younger sister and father, but Sonali was burnt 72 percent
 sonaali ke mutabik ve ladke uske saath chhedhkhani karte the, or jab usne virodh kiya to unhone aisa kaam kiya
 Police arrested three accused 20 days after the incident
 maamla dhanbad jila adaalat main chalata rahaa, lekin ghatana ke chah maheene baad iske sadame se sonaali ke dada kii maut ho gai, jabaki maa ab tak gumsum he
 Three years later, i
e
 in 2006, the Dhanbad District Court sentenced the two convicts to nine years, while one survived due to being a minor
 aaropee us sajaa ke khilaaf jharkhand hycourt gaye, or varsh 2007 main court ne unhen jamaanat de di
 On getting bail, Sonali's family started getting threats and everything was plundered under the burden of treatment
 sonaali ke pita ke mutabik uske ilaaj main kareeb 12 lakh rupee kharch ho chuke hai
 She has several more surgeries at Delhi's Safdarjung and AIIMS Hospital, but now she has no money left for treatment
 tippaniyan However, after the news was shown in the media, many hands have come forward to help Sonali
 jane-maane vakil ram jethmalani ne somvaar ko sonaali se apane ghar par mulaakaat kii, or kanoonee madad kaa bharosa dilaane ke saath-saath ek lakh 39 hazaar rupee kii aarthik madad bhi kii
 To help Sonali, you can deposit money in the account number 0612−000−1032−17964 of Chandidas Mukherjee in the Naoroji Nagar branch of Punjab National Bank in Delhi or in this regard his brother Devashish Mukherjee's number 0943−7638− Can talk on 600
 nau saal pehle kii sonaali mukherjee, ensisi captain, college kii topper, hansatii-khelti, ek aam ladki thi
 
 
 But after nine years, not only has Sonali, 27, changed her life, but her face has also deteriorated, her eyes have lost light, and there is hardly any part of the body that is not burnt
 ek hafte se sonaali dilli main he
 He has only two demands - or he gets justice or euthanasia
 
 
 sonaali kii dardanaak kahani ko shabdon main bayaan karnaa mushkil he, lekin enditivi india se baatcheet main usne apane jivan kii kadavi sachai bataai
 According to Sonali of Dhanbad, Jharkhand, it was the night of April 22, 2003, when three boys from her neighborhood came to her house and threw acid on her
 tejaab ke chhinte uski choti bahan or pita par bhi gire, lekin sonaali 72 pratishat jal gai
 According to Sonali, those boys used to seduce her, and when she protested, she did such a thing
 ghatana ke 20 din baad police ne teen aropiyon ko giraftaar kiya
 The case continued in the Dhanbad district court, but six months after the incident, Sonali's grandfather died due to the shock, while the mother is still dead
 teen saal baad, yani varsh 2006 main dhanbad jila court ne do doshiyon ko nau saal kii sajaa sunai, jabaki ek naaballig hone ke kaaran batch gaya
 The accused went to the Jharkhand High Court against that conviction, and in 2007, the court granted them bail
