 BJD MP from Puri Lok Sabha Pinaki Mishra had asked that in the last ten years the number of teachers teaching Sanskrit has come down drastically due to lack of job opportunities, is this correct? kya sanskrit chaatro kii sankhya main kami ai he
 Replying on 17 July 2017, Minister of State for Human Resources, Dr
 Mahendra Nath Pandey said that the Ministry does not keep a record of the number of teachers teaching Sanskrit in schools and colleges
 uplabdh soochna ke anusaar sanskrit shikshakon ke padon main koi kami nahin ai he
 What is there when the Ministry of Human Resources does not have a record of the number of teachers
 phir bhi mantri ji kah rahe hai ki sanskrit shikshakon ke padon main koi kami nahin ai he
 We have seen many places that Sanskrit teachers are few
 chaatro main bhi kami ai he
 Sampurnanand Sanskrit University of Banaras also has less Sanskrit teachers
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ke kulapati bhi maanate hai ki shikshak kam hai
 The National Institute of Sanskrit Education has a full charter for the development of Sanskrit
 iske baad bhi sanskrit ke vikaas ke liye doosraa sanskrit ayog bana, jisaki report endie ke samay jamaa hui he
 The report of the new chairman says that outright grants should be given for new Sanskrit universities in different states
 sabhi sanskrit uniwarsity main skill deveopment ke course ke liye grant diya jaae
 Special grants should be given to start modern subjects

 The scriptures should be studied in ordinary Sanskrit

 Make India a world guru, keep chanting this slogan, everything will be alright with that
 80 ke dashak tak yahaan 300 ke kareeb chaatr hua karte the, is samay sirf 7 chaatr hai
 For this, there is a teacher whose salary is sent by the government and there are three employees
 saat chaatro ke liye ek shikshak
 It seems that no one is going to see how to use the government's resources better
 1978 main is santhaan ke sansthaapak kii zamin vivaad main hatya ho gai thi
 The comments in bekaar pade sansadhano kaa istemaal bhi sanskrit ke vikaas main ho saktaa tha, magar uske liye zaruri he ki kaam ho

 aam taur par charchaaon se dur rahane vaale sarkari santhaan karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi sanghathan (ipiefo) se aajkal akasar khabaren aa rahi hai
 Besides making itself more modern, it is also making it easier for millions of its members to reach themselves
 ipiefo ke kamishnar ke
 K
 jalaan ne haal hi main mani today ke deepak mandal se baatcheet main apni praathamiktaaon ke bare main bataaya
 Excerpts: EPFO has made many changes with the help of new technology
 inamen online balance or clem kii sthiti kaa pataa karne kii suvidha shaamil he
 What is the reaction of employees and employees on all this? The big change in this year is the electronic invoice-return
 yah karmchaaree or amployrs donon ke liye upyogi he
 Earlier, employers had to file five separate returns
 ab unhen sirf ek ritern bharna hota he or vah bhi electronic tareeke se
 Employees' money goes directly to their account
 ab ve apane khaaton main jamaa raashi online dekh sakate hai
 This also makes our job easier because we can see how many establishments have filled invoices and how many employees
 chaalaan set-ap main or bhi kai system shaamil kiye gaye hai, jaise salanaa khaataa apgrade, online transfar
 Running an EPF account can be as easy as running a Savings Bank account? It will take time but that should be our intention
 agar ham aisa nahin karte to ham sabase acchhee sarvice nahin de paaenge
 We should try to reach that level tomorrow, if not today
 vahaan tak pahunchane ke liye kya-kya karnaa hoga?aaj ipiefo amploir kendrit he
 That is, the employer gives the provident fund number to the employees
 yah jimmedaari hamen leni hogi
 The employees will have to give the PF number themselves
 hamen karmchaariyon ko universal number or alag accounts dene honge
 The next year will be a challenge for the EPFO
 ipiefo ke karmchaariyon ko samajhnaa chahie ki pension bill paas hone ke baad bahut sari nijee companiyaan is kshetra main aa jaaengi
 She will bring new technology with her
 agar ipiefo ne technology nahin sudhari to maat kha jayega
 The EPFO will have to adapt to the changing environment
 isliye main kahata hum ki aglaa ek saal chunautiyon bharaa hoga or hamen jitani jaldi ho sake, chunauti kaa saamana kar lenaa chahie
 Does this mean that the EPFO should contact the employees directly? i mean that we should find a way through which we can communicate directly with the employees
 isiilie ham universal provident fund number kii baat kar rahe hai
 This number should remain the same wherever the person works
 kya is disha main koi pragati hui he?kuch tarakkee hui he, ham kuch koshish kar rahe hai
 Even before this, we have tried to issue these numbers three or four times
 aisa karne ke kai kendrikrut / vikendrikrut tareeke hai
 There are many challenges related to technology, administration and law
 hamen bahut sari manzooriyaan bhi leni padengi
 Meaning, we will have to get approval for amendment of the scheme, which the Ministry will give
 mujhe aisa karne ke liye technology chahie or saath hi staff ko bhi saath lenaa hoga
 Last year, an internal notification by the EPFO created a stir among salaried employees that EPF contribution should be based on total pay, not just basic pay
 abhi is mudde ko bhale hi thande baste main daal diya he lekin kuch to rasta nikaalnaa padegaa
 What would that be? You are talking about the circular dated November 30, 2012
 vah ab bhi mantralay main he
 This has not changed the law
 vah to kanoon kii ek vyakhya he jo madras hycourt kar chukaa he
 Still some people felt that this is a change, but it is not
 jo bhi ho, maamla mantralay main he or vah uske bare main sochega
 Experts say the impact will be Rs 6,500
 se zyada basic selary paane vaale karmchaariyon par nahin padegaa?asar kyon padana chahie? agar aapkaa mul vetan 6,500 ru
 If it is more than that, it should not affect you
 vaise bhi ipief main anshdaan bahut had tak svaichhik he
 There is no need to approach EPFO
 kuch jaankaar kehete hai ki ek baar ipief main shaamil hue to phir hameshaa iskaa hissaa rahete hai
 It's not like this
 mudda yah he ki agar basic selary 6,500 ru
 If you are in EPF, you should not be deprived of the benefits related to basic salary even if you are above 6,500
 isliye yah kaha jaataa he ki aap ek baar ipief main shaamil hue to hameshaa isamen rahenge
 The objective is that the employees should not misuse the law by depriving employees of EPF benefits
 agar aapane ek baar sanghathan chhod diya to aap ipief ke sadsy nahin rahete
 Then after two months, if you take someone else's job, how will the EPFO know? Is it not mandatory for companies with more than 20 employees to be a member of the EPFO? Yes, it is necessary, but they can always say that their The basic salary of the employees is Rs 6,500
 se zyada he or anshdaan se batch sakate hai
 They only have to pay the administrative fee
 aise kai sanghathan hai jo yah shulk de rahe hai
 It is very low i
e
 only seven rupees
 he
 We are going to amend it
 nayaa shulk kya hoga?pehle hamen kanoon main sanshodhan ke liye prayaas karnaa he
 Its proposal will go to the Ministry of Labor
 6,500 ru
 There is also talk of raising the limit of Rs
 Is there any such plan and if so how much and for how long? Yes, it is a plan to increase the limit, it will be increased to Rs 10,000
 karne kaa cabinet note aage badhaayaa gaya he
 Like the ESI (employees State Insurance) scheme, we have increased it to Rs 15,000
 karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 It has been discussed a lot, but it is a legal matter
 ipiefo ke mukhiya ke naate meraa maananaa he ki seemaa baxi chahie par kab hoga, pataa nahin
 The Central Board of Trustees recently relaxed the rules to invest EPF amount
 ab aap eee reating vaale privet bands ke saath dderghaavadhi piesu bands main invest kar sakate hai
 How much will it earn? This is what the government wants
 hamaari manshaa dotarafa laabh kii he—ek to zyada ritern lenaa or saath hi fund ko surakshit rakhana
 Now our investment in Indian government securities will be less
 rajya pratibhutiyon main bhi investment kam hoga, jabaki sarkari or nijee kshetra ke bands main investment bad saktaa he, kyonki sarkari or nijee kshetra ke bands zyada ritern dete hai
 Therefore, earnings are expected to increase
 jab se nai pension yojana (enpies) sab ke liye kholi gai he tab se enpies or ipief / ipies kii tulana hone lagi he
 Do you think this is correct? How would you compare the two? In the last four years (may 2009 to May 2013), our returns on an annual basis were better than the NPS
 hamane 10
 Has given a return of 47 per cent, while the central and state government schemes of NPS have 9 respectively
 85 or 9
 Returned 17 percent
 mujhe yah bataate hue khushi ho rahi he ki ipief acha ritern de rahaa he
 It is exempt from tax on withdrawals, while NPS does not currently have this facility
 pension bill se maahaul kaise badalegaa?privet pension funds ke aane se shaayad svaichhik anshdaan par asar nahin padegaa
 EPFO will have to provide better service
 ipief sarvice ke bare main kuch gambhir mudde the
 If we are improving our service and continue to improve in this way, then there is no reason why we cannot compete with private pension funds in the case of returns
 enpies kii koshish korporate gharaanon or unke staff ko isamen shaamil karne kii he
 It also proposes additional tax benefits for employees who contribute through employees
 enpies se ipief ko chunauti mil sakati he?jahaan tak tex laabh kaa sawaal he, main kuch nahin kah saktaa, lekin enpies ke saath hode ko main sakaaratmak dhang se letaa hum
 This is what i tell my officials that we have to improve our services
 ab tak ham acha karte aa rahe he, lekin vah sab vaidhanik tantra ke tahat
 We have to get out of this thinking and work in a service environment
 kya ipief kii rakam equity main lagegi?vitt mantralay ko 5-15 pratishat fund equity main invest karne main koi etraj nahin he, lekin central board of trustees ne un companiyon ko lekar kadi sharten laga rakhi hai, jinamein ipief invest ho saktaa he
 Therefore very few options exist
 iske alaava maujuuda maahaul main hamaari bazaar main invest karne kii himmat bhi nahin ho rahi he
 But i do not say that EPF will never invest in equity
 jab hamaara fund sies or badhegaa to achche date instrument milanaa mushkil ho saktaa he, tab hamen equity main invest karnaa hi hoga
 So, i do not say that we will never invest in equity

 maamla gajiabad ke sahibabad sthit shyaam park ilaake kaa he

 Police have registered a case against the accused youth on the tahrir of the child's father

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main uttarakhand main bijepi ne siem trivendra singh ravat ke netritv main record kaayam kar liya he
 There was a myth in this state for the last 19 years
 uttarakhand gathan ke baad abtak rajya main chaar baar loksabhaa chunaav hue hai
 The interesting thing is that the party whose government is in the state has to face defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin uttarakhand bijepi is paripati ko badalane main kaamyaab rahi he
 Ajay Tamta won from the five seats of Almora in the Modi wave of 2019
 32 lakh, gadhwal se tirath singh ravat ne congress ke manish khanduri ko 3 lakh, haridwar se ramesh pokharial ne congress ke ambarish kumaar ko 2
 58 lakh, Ajay Bhatt from nainital-udham Singh Nagar to Harish Rawat of Congress 3
 39 lakh or tehri gadhwal se maala lakshmi shah ne congress se preetam singh ko 3 lakh se zyada voton ke antar se maat di
 This has been the case in the Lok Sabha elections in 2004 after the formation of Uttarakhand in 2000
 tab kaddavar netaa endi tiwari uttarakhand ke siem the
 It was believed that Tiwari would capture the five Lok Sabha seats of the state on the strength of his leadership skills, but the election results were shocking, the Congress could only win the Nainital seat

 piem modi 27-28 april ko china ke daure par ja rahe hai
 His sudden visit can be considered a major development in the recent india-china relationship
 doklam par maheenon tak gatirodh bane rahane or bharat dwaara sakhti dikhaane ke baad ab china ko bhi yah samaj main aa gaya he ki yah 1962 kaa bharat nahin he
 Here India has also given many good signs to China
 to ab piem modi kii is yatra se donon deshon ke bich ek vyaavhaarik rishte kii shuruyaat ho sakati he
 This could be a big bet for PM Modi
 china se 1962 main ek jang haarane ke baad ham phir puri takat se khadey ho gaye hai
 India showed a tough stance this time in the 73-day standoff at Doklam
 piem modi or china ke raashtrapati shi jinping ke bich ek anaupchaarik shikhar vaarta hogi jisamen seemaa vivaad niptaare kii disha main kadam aage bad saktaa he
 If there is some peaceful approach to the border dispute between the two countries, it can lead to long-term stability in South Asia
 bharat or china ke bich is pighalate barf main donon deshon kii samajhadaari or vyaavhaarikta dikh rahi he
 For this, especially under the leadership of PM Modi, India tried to give good signals to China
 maldive par sanyamhal main maldive main apatkaal ke dauraan bhi bharat ne kaaphi sanyam bartaa or china se kaha he ki vah apane padosi desh main hastkshep nahin karegaa
 India has emphasized that the move will strengthen the 'strategic trust' between the two countries
 tibetiyon ke prati vyavhaar main badlaavpiem modi kii achaanak china yatra kii bhoomika main dalai lamas or bharat main pravaasiyon tibetiyon ke saath sarkaar ke badale ravaie ko bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 The Dalai Lama's program in Delhi was abruptly canceled
 iske baad ek vibhageeya letters li hua jisase yah pataa chalaa ki sarkaar ne apane varisht adhikariyon or mantriyon ko nirvasit tibeti sarkaar ke kaaryakramon se duuri banane ko kaha
 The 'thank India' program of Tibetans was quietly shifted to Dharamshala
 haalanki isamen bijepi ke varisht netaa ram madhav or kendriya mantri mahesh sharma shaamil hue, lekin is kaarykram ko utani tavajjo nahin mil pai
 According to media reports, the government informed China of its move
 yani ise ek gudwil banane ke liye istemaal kiya gaya ki bharat sarkaar china kii chintaaon kaa dhyaan rakhti he
 After this, on 23 February, Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale visited China
 sambhavat: isi dauraan is par baatcheet hui ki kya donon deshon ke rashtradhyaksh str par baatcheet ho sakati he
 After this, when Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj went to China, Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced PM Modi's visit at a joint press conference
 china ke videsh mantri ne kaha, 'donon netaa shatabdiyon main hone vaale badlaavon se jude samrik masalon par baat kar sakate hai
 Both can talk about the future of india-china relations
 'doklam se china ko mila sabakyah sach he ki china sainya auraarthik rup sebharat se kaaphi aage he
 But this time in Doklam, India showed strictness to China
 bhartiya sena samrik rup se kaaphi agrim morche par thi or china kii janamukti sena (PLA) ke kisi bhi aakraamakata kaa jawaab dene ke liye taiyaar thi
 For more than 70 days no one had a problem
 is baar china ke liye khel 1962 ke jaisaa aasaan nahin tha
 The situation is opposite from 1962 also because India is a big market for Chinese companies
 tab ke daure main donon deshon kaa vaishvik vyapaar simit tha
 China's business is heavy in the business of both countries, so the pressure of the corporate world also remains on China
 aise main china bhi shaayad yah samaj chukaa he ki abaesia kiek badi takat ban chuke bharat se ulajhane kii jagah kaarobaari saajhedaari rakhane main zyada bhalaai he
 So PM Modi will probably try to forge a new kind of relationship with China now

 Joyce wrote on Twitter, 'don't weaken yourself? This attitude will make cricket a true global sport
 khun khul rahaa he
 Richardson also supported reducing the number of teams from the current 14 to 10 in the 2019 World Cup in England
 richardsan ne haalanki america main cricket ko sthapit karne kaa samarthan karte hue kaha, 'america ek aise desh kaa udhaaharan he jisamen kaaphi kshamta he
 "he said," More players are playing cricket than Zimbabwe in America and i think it is very close to the players playing in New Zealand
 ' richardsan ne kaha, 'agar yuai world cap ke liye kwalifai kar saktaa he to aisa koi kaaran nahin he ki america nahin kar saktaa
 We will keep an eye on it in the next few years

 He said, 'demonetisation has benefited a lot and some things have become cheaper than before
 unhen hi nahin jin housewif se bhi unhone baat kii he, ve sab is note bandi se khush hai
 Ranjit Ranjan criticized the decision after which Congress MP Ranjit went to Ranjan's house, where her husband MP Pappu Yadav was also present
 un donon se jab notebandi aurakashles lendenke bare main poocha, to saansad ranjit ranjan kaa saaf kahana tha ki notebandi se unhen bahut nuksaan hua he
 Due to heavy cash crunch, household expenses have been reduced
 unhone bataaya ki note bandi ke baad vah bank bhi gai thi, isse hua yah ki unhone apane pati se jo paisa chupa ke rakhaa tha, vah ujagar ho gaya
 To this she questions, 'is it black money

 Now all of that has come in front of her husband
 pappu yadav ne kii cashles india kii takaliphenhaalanki ranjit ranjan or unke saansad pati pappu yadav kaa kahana he ki unhone kabhi bazaar jaakar koi saamaan nahin kharida, isliye unako paise or cashles se koi fark nahin padaa he
 But the poor whom he used to get treatment in Delhi and he has made arrangements for his stay in his house
 notebandi ke baad unhen pareshaani ho rahi he
 He says that people from many other states including Bihar come to him and he helps in his treatment
 unke liye dawaaon or khaane-pine kii chizon kii vyavastha karavaate hai
 After demonetisation, he is now facing problems in helping such people
 pappu yadav kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki desh main kisaanon, mazdooron or garibon ke saamne kaaphi badi samasya khadi ho gai he
 Due to demonetisation, people do not have work and many workers have become unemployed
 sarkaar cashles kii to baat kar rahi he, magar jinke paas kaam-dhandha nahin, paisa nahin, vah log kya karenge

 Is the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) working on a strategy to help the Congress internalize against the BJP in the Gujarat elections? The party's Gujarat in-charge Gopal Rai says that the AAP will contest elections not to cut votes in the state but to change, but at the same time they say that where there will be no strong candidates for the party, it is against the most powerful candidate against BJP
 Will be emphasized for ‘aaj tak’ se baatcheet main gopal raay ne saaf kaha ki AAP ko congress ke svachh chhavi vaale chehron ko samarthan dene se bhi parhez nahin hoga
 The AAP, which is contesting for the first time for the Gujarat assembly elections, has decided that it will contest not all the seats but in the same seats in the state where the party's organization will be strong and present at the booth level
 bijepi ko haraane ke liye utrenge chunaav mendilli sarkaar main mantri gopal raay ne do took kaha ki vah gujarat main bijepi ke khilaaf padane vaale voton ko kaatane ke liye nahin balki bijepi ko haraane ke liye chunavi samar main utrenge
 Gopal Rai says that in the seats where the Aam Aadmi Party's position is not good and where it does not have the organization up to the booth level, it does not want to field its candidates by casting votes against the BJP
 aisi siton par AAP bijepi ke khilaaf jo bhi majboot ummidavaar hoga uskaa samarthan or madad karegi
 Whether these candidates are independents or belong to any other party
 congress kii madad karnaa chaahati he 'aap'?gopal raay se jab poocha gaya ki yah sanket dekar party gujarat main sidhe sidhe congress kii madad karnaa to nahin chaah rahi? is sawaal par gopal raay ne kaha, "gujarat kaa chunaav BJP banaam gujarat kii janata he
 The Congress cannot win the Gujarat Assembly elections on its own
 gujarat kii janata bijepi ko haraane ke liye khadi he or vah har us ummidavaar ko jitaayegi jo bijepi ummidavaar ko majbootee se chunauti detaa najar aayega
 In such a situation, where the aap's position will be strong, the people of Gujarat will win our candidates
 jahaan par nirdaleey athwa duusari party ke svachh chhavi vaale ummidavaar majboot sthiti main hongen AAP unki madad karegi
 The party will not benefit from cutting votes on such seats
 "chunaav nahin ladane se aap ko hoga doharaa nuksaanaaf se jude sutron kaa kahana he ki gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ladanaa party kii majaburi bhi he kyonki bina chunaav lade rajya main sanghathan kaa failaav hona mushkil he or chunaav na ladane se pichley 3 saalon main banaae gaye sanghathan ko nuksaan ho saktaa he
 That is why the Aam Aadmi Party is trying to hit two with one stone in Gujarat
 pehali koshish he ki chunaav lard kar duusare rajyon main uskaa vistaar bade or sanghathan majboot ho saath hi duusari koshish yah bhi he ki bijepi ke khilaaf voton kaa bantwaaraa karne kii bajaae jeet kii sambhaavna vaale duusare ummidavaaron kii madad kii jaae
 In such a situation, it is clear that the BJP does not want to take the charge that it helped the BJP by cutting votes in Gujarat
 party kii gujarat ikai hardik patel or jignesh mevani jaise patidaar netaaon or dalit activiston ke sampark main bhi he
 AAP will not tie up with anyone AAP has clearly ruled out any possibility of any kind of alliance before the elections in Gujarat
 gopal raay ne diwali ke baad apane ummidavaaron kii pehali list jari karne kaa sanket diya
 According to Gopal Rai, the party has focused on around 150 assembly seats in Gujarat
 sutron ke mutabik gujarat main AAP kii chunaav samiti ne ummidavaaron kii ek list party kii piesi ko bheji he jis par aakhri muhar party kii sarvocch ikai (piesi) kii ore se diwali ke baad lagegi
 Although the party is not disclosing the number of seats that the Aam Aadmi Party will contest in Gujarat, but if Gopal Rai believes, the party will compete in all the seats where the party's organization will be strong to the booth level and where they will defeat the BJP Will have capacity
 kya kejariwal gujarat main prachaar karenge?kya arvind kejariwal gujarat main party ke liye prachaar karenge? is sawaal kaa gopal raay ne koi saaf jawaab nahin diya
 He says that as the Chief Minister of Delhi, Kejriwal is currently focusing on Delhi which is the first responsibility of the party
 aise main jab duusare rajyon main party ko unki jarurat hogi to unhen prachaar ke liye jarur aagrah kiya jayega
 According to sources, Kejriwal will attend the Aam Aadmi Party workers conference in Bhopal on November 5, and if sources are to be believed, on the same date, Kejriwal will also play the trumpet for next year's assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh
 gopal raay kaa kahana he ki aam aadmi party andhadhundh chunaav main ladane kii bajaay un rajyon main chunaav ladegi jahaan par vah sanghathan banane kii kshamta rakhti hogi or jahaan party ke chunaav jeetne kii ummid dikh rahi ho
 According to Gopal Rai, the party is working at the organization level in other states and after reviewing the strength of the organization, a detailed roadmap will be prepared and contested firmly in those states

 "he said," Those working in companies in the information technology and construction sectors have to complete projects within a certain period of time, so they are bound to get stressed
 vaishvik pratispardhaa ke kaaran companiyon par bhi samay se kaam puraa karne kaa dabaav hota he
 "in the accountancy sector companies work is very stressful at the end of the financial year, so the work of employees of such companies between January and March is very stressful and tiring," says Jain
 ’’kuch chikitsakeey shodh main nishkarsh nikaala gaya he ki aise kshetron kii companiyon ko apane karmchaariyon ko din main kuch minute jhapai ke liye bhi dena chaiye kyonki 20 minute kii jhapai agle do se teen ghante or 45 minute kii bhapaki agle chah se saat ghante tak kaaryakshmata badha sakati he

 Ajay Aggarwal said that in the last Lok Sabha election, he had competed against the then Congress President Sonia Gandhi only on the strength of himself and the workers
 agar bhaajapa ne is chunaav main unka tikat kaata to party ko vaisya samaaj main aakrosh ke kaaran bahut baari nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 He said that if the BJP took suicidal steps to cut the ticket of Vaishya Samaj from Rae Bareli to any other caste, then this society would be spread all over Uttar Pradesh especially Rae Bareli, Lucknow, Fatehpur, Kanpur, Varanasi, Amethi, Barabanki, Faizabad, Mohanlalganj and Kaushambi Lok Sabha constituencies
 i can express my anger
 ajay agarwal ne kaha ki party ke hit main vah aagrah karnaa chaahate hai ki raibareli loksabhaa kshetra main 2014 main vaisya samaaj ko die gaye pratinidhitiv main koi badlaav na kiya jaae
 It may be known that Agarwal, who was the national secretary of SP, had contested from Rae Bareli seat on BJP ticket in 2014 and got about one lakh 74 thousand votes, although he lost to Sonia Gandhi by more than three lakh 52 thousand votes

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dene ke maamle par ajtak se khaas baatcheet kii
 Kejriwal has been going on an indefinite fast since March 1 with this demand
 padhein unhone apane puure intervyuu main kin maamalon par kya kaha-1- arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki 70 saalon se dilli ke logon ko bevakoof banaaya ja rahaa he
 In 1949, democracy came in the whole country, but this is not the case with Delhi
 yahaan ke log apni sarkaar to chunate hai, lekin sarkaar ke paas takat hi nahin he
 2- Former Delhi Chief Ministers Sheila Dixit, Madan Lal Khurana or Sahib Singh Verma also did not have full strength
 madanlaal khurana ne vidhansabha main kaha tha ki dilli ke mukhyamantri kii takat ek chaparasi ke baraabar bhi nahin he
 This statement is recorded
 unhone bhi purna rajya ke liye aawaaj uthaai thi
 3- Atal Bihari Vajpayee had brought the law to make Delhi a full state, but the law was also over when the term of Parliament was over
 shila dikshit bhi 15 saal tak iske liye aawaaj uthaati raheen
 4- Sheela ji had more power
 vah dilli ke kisi bhi adhikari kaa transfar kar sakati thim
 She could decide who would become Education, Health and Chief Secretary of Delhi
 hamaari sarkaar banane ke 3 maheene baad modi sarkaar ne ek notification jari karke hamase sari takat chin lee
 Now the central government decides this work
 ab manish sisodiya acha kaam karte hai to centre sarkaar ajukeshan secretary ko badalakar sabase bhrasht aadmi ko vahaan baitha detii he
 5- Despite all these, we made revolutionary decisions in the fields of education, health, electricity and water, which no government has taken in 70 years
 kisi rajya main 15 saal kii sarkaar main bhi itane kaam nahin hue, jitne hamane chaar saal main kaam kiye
 We worked with the strength we had
 6- jis din dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja mila, dilli ke har parivaar ko das saal main ek-ek ghar de denge
 If Delhi is freed from the builder mafia, then everyone can get home
 dilli main saalon se uniwarsity nahin bani
 We told the Modi government that we have to open colleges, we should be allowed to build universities
 teen saal main koi faisla nahin hua
 Today, parents of children who bring 95 percent number in Delhi get upset because there is no college to study here
 7- ham dilli main sisitivi camere lagaana chaahate the, teen saal tak modi sarkaar file lekar baith gai thi
 i fought and brought the file signed
 agle hafte se dilli main sisitivi camere lagane vaale hai
 Manish Sisodia had to sit on lg's house to get the file signed
 vah apane bachche kaa admician karwaane yaa naukari ke liye vahaan nahin gaye the
 The files were signed
 8- desh kii majaburi he bijepi ko haraana jaruri he
 We are not doing anything for power
 hamaara bas ek hi lakshya he ki amit shah or modi kaa haraana
 i feel that Congress and Aam Aadmi Party are not getting aligned
 agar ham donon saath aate to bijepi vip out ho jaati lekin abhi ham kadi takkar denge
 Today, if the Aam Aadmi Party has to be closed for the country, i will close it in four minutes
 main sugar kaa pesheynt hum phir bhi upwas par baith rahaa hum yani jaan daanv par laga rahaa hum
 It is not important for anyone to become Prime Minister to defeat Amit Shah and Modi
 inhone paanch saal main desh kaa bedaa gark kar diya he
 9- Today, two lakh jobs can be left in Delhi, but it is not in my hands
 modi sarkaar ke haath main he
 If Delhi becomes a full state, then i can give government jobs to two lakh people immediately
 10- meraa upwas dilli ke logon ko purna rajya ke andolan ke liye sangathit karne ke liye he
 My movement is not for making any demands from any government
 sansad khatm ho rahi he
 If there is no government left, then we have no demand from anyone
 ek march se andolan shuru ho rahaa he
 This will continue in various ways
 yah andolan dilli ko purna rajya banane tak jari rahegaa
 11- At this time the situation in the center is such that if our seven mps are formed then we will have a lot of power
 meraa dil ye kahata he ki saat saansad aane se do saal ke andar dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja mil jayega
 12- BJP and Congress have cheated Delhiites for many years
 yah dekhakar mujhe bada dukh hota he
 Sahib Singh Verma's son Pravesh Verma and Madanlal Khurana's son Harish Khurana are opposing the full state
 in donon ke pita ne purna rajya ke liye ladaai ladi thi
 Sheila Dixit fought for the full state for 15 years and now she is opposing it
 13- dekhte hai ki upwas ke baad kya hote hai
 People will gather, signatures, marches, see where the fast will end
 bhaajapa ne kaha tha ki saat saansad de do, purna rajya kaa darja denge
 He did not fulfill his promise
 ab ham kah rahe hai ki hamen saat saansad de do, ham purna rajya kaa darja denge
 14- People of the country have seen how dangerous the modi-shah pair is for the country
 inhone desh kaa bedaa gark kar diya
 He demonetized, GST, sealing
 acchhee-khaasi arthvyavastha par brake laga die
 One and a half crore people became unemployed
 sabase galat kaam ye kiya ki desh kaa bhaichara khatm kar diya
 Hindus fought Muslims
 jaaton ko non jat se, maratha ko non maratha se, patel ko non patel se ladaa diya
 They have done poison work in people's minds
 15- pakistan pichley 70 saal se koshish kar rahaa he ki kaise bharat ko kamjor kiya jaae
 How to divide the people of India in the name of religion, which was not successful in Pakistan in 70 years, that was done by Modi and Amit Shah in five years
 16- 2019 main agar modi-shah jeet gaye to ye desh kaa samvidhan badalakar chunaav karana khatm kar denge, jaisaa ki hitler ne kiya tha
 Just now Amit Shah had said in one of his rally that if he wins in 2019, no one can defeat BJP by 2050
 inaki aisi hi planning he
 It is necessary to save democracy and country at this time
 17- is samay desh main yah jaruri he ki bhaajapa ke khilaaf keval ek ummidavaar khadaa ho taaki vot bante nahin
 The last time the BJP won by 31 per cent of the vote, that is, 69 per cent were against it
 ye aankada tab kaa he jab modi lahar chal rahi thi
 18- We are not coming to the Central Government
 main koi gathbandhan satta ke liye nahin kar rahaa hum
 This is important for the country
 desh kii majaburi he, bijepi ko haraana jaruri he
 19- Modi ji had said that Swaminathan will implement the report of the commission
 aaj kisaan kitne dukhi hai
 Today mob lynching is happening anywhere in the country, no one is caught
 agar desh main shanti yaa bhaichara nahin hoga to desh pragati nahin kar saktaa
 20- Mass scale of ED and IT is getting red
 aap desh main kisi se bhi baat karlo
 Talk to the judges
 sab log baat karne main darate hai ki kol record ho rahi he
 21- Pulwama attack is being politicized
 bhaajapa vaale shaheedon ke gharon main bhaajapa ke jhande lagane kii baat kar rahe hai, soshal media main chal rahaa he
 There may be differences with my Modi ji, but if he takes strict action against Pakistan, i will support him
 pakistan kuch bhi karke chalaa jaataa he
 He should know its value
 22- modi sarkaar ne do galat sandesh die
 For one, Modi ji went without schedule, calling Nawaz Sharif on his birthday
 jisase pakistan ko kahin na kahin hamaari kamajori kaa ehsaas hua
 On the other hand, the ISI men attacked Pathankot's airbase
 hamane unheen aatankiyon ko bulaakar isaki jaanch karne ko kah diya
 They give a feeling of weakness
 international diplomasi barabari par chalati he
 If they kill 40, then you kill 400
 aisa ection lo ki pakistan ko das guna keemat chukaani pade
 Will not think of doing so again
 23- mujhe congress kii niyat samaj nahin aa rahi he
 In Delhi, it is weakening the Aam Aadmi Party
 uttar pradesh main sapa-basapa ko kamjor kar rahi he
 In West Bengal, he is weakening Mamata ji
 mujhe lagata he ki vot bantane nahin chahie
 24- If our seven mps win, we will not take any place in the cabinet
 ham bas dilli kaa purna rajya kaa darja lenge
 25- The Central Government is doing raid of CBI, ED, IT to scare the State Governments
 agar logon ko rajya sarkarein pasand nahin he to log unhen badal denge
 Nothing will happen by scaring them
 modi apni sarkaar ko agenciyon se chalaanaa chaah rahe hai
 What will happen if the ED is interrogated two months before the election, sending 40 CBI officers to the Kolkata commissioner's house
 neerav modi, vijay maalya ko pakadana tha, unhen to nahin pakadaa

 (input agency se) (from input agency) tripura ke baad nagaland main bhi bijepi gathbandhan ko acchhee siten milti dikh rahi hai
 However, the result is quite volatile and the picture will be clear only after the final result
 lekin bijepi gathbandhan main sarkaar banane kii sugabugahat shuru ho gai he
 Much of the credit for the alliance gains in the state goes to the 67-year-old leader of the NDPP, Neiphiu Rio
 bijepi gathbandhan kii choti saathi he, andipeepi zyada siton par ladi thi or use zyada siten milti dikh bhi rahi hai
 Therefore, there is a strong possibility that NDPP leader Nefiu Rio will be made CM in Nagaland
 rio kii lokapriyata kaa alam yah he ki vah pehle hi apana chunaav nirvirodh jeet chuke hai
 Rio has been the Chief Minister of Nagaland for nearly 11 years
 unhen aaj nagaland main sabase kaddavar netaa mana jaataa he
 His party is winning more seats, so naturally he is a strong contender for the Chief Minister
 vah piem modi ko bhi pasand hai
 He first became the CM of the state in the year 2003, when he was the leader of the Naga People's Front and this party formed a BJP alliance
 rio ne iske ek saal pehle hi congress se baghawat kar naga piples front kaa gathan kiya tha

 janvari 2018 main hi naga piples front ke bhartiya janata party ke saath gathbandhan todane ke baad nefiu rio ne andipeepi party kaa daaman tham liya
 The Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) was formed last year
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki rio kii shah par hi enpief ke baagiyon ne is nai party kaa gathan kiya
 In February this year itself, the party entered the electoral arena in alliance with the BJP
 bijepi or andipeepi donon ne kramash: 20 or 40 siton par ummidavaar utaare the
 Voting was held on February 27 in 59 of the state's 60 seats
 haalanki rio ke kaarykaal main bheebhrashtachar kekai aarope saamne aae the
 After this, in view of the pressure, he resigned as Chief Minister in 2014 and contested the Lok Sabha elections, in which he also won

 narendra modi ne kaha ki mahangaai kii maar se desh ke log behaal hai
 Referring to the country's plight, Narendra Modi said that today the mood of the country is like 1974
 narendra modi ne gandhinagar se hi patna main baithe kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit kiya
 Modi simultaneously discussed every major issue with 1500 workers
 unhone kaha ki ve bihar kii dharohar or kaabiliyat kaa puraa-puraa sammaan karte hai
 During this, leaders like Sushil Kumar Modi, Ashwini Choubey asked him questions
 narendra modi ne bihar ke baankaa jile main naksalwad kii samasya ke bare main vistaar se jaankaree hasil kii
 He also remembered the late MP Digvijay Singh, who was an MP from Banka district

 The prosecution said this helped the FBI extract important information from Headley about the lashkar-e-taiba, while the defense described him as a fraudster who betrayed his client
 america sangheey etorni ne viki peters ne jeuri ko bataaya ki david colmen hedli ne varsh 2009 main apni giraftaar ke do saptaah ke bheetar lashkare taiyaba ke pakistan main maujuud aatankakwaadi netaaon ke bare main mahatvapurn jaankaree muhaiyaa karaane ke saath hi uske dhaanche or aatankwaadi sajishon kii yojana ke bare main jaankaree di
 Vicky defended the deal with Headley under which he would not be sentenced to death nor would he be extradited to India, Pakistan or Denmark
 unhone kaha ki yah hedli kii taraf se kiye gaye sahyog kaa pratifal he
 Without mentioning India, he said that the information received from Headley was shared with other governments
 isse kai aatankwaadi hamalon ko bachaane main madad mili
 He said that there is no doubt that Headley is a 'vicious person'
 unhone kaha ki koi bhi hamalaa karne ke liye bahut yojana or maanavshakti kii jarurat padati he
 He said that Headley will not be given the death penalty under the agreement, but the government will request the judge to sentence him to as many years of imprisonment as he thinks is appropriate for him

 The federal jury, which is hearing the case, is now about to start final deliberations to decide Rana after the final arguments in the case are completed
 adaalat apana faisla buudhvaar ko suna sakati he
 Rana's defense had on Tuesday urged the court not to be confused with Headley's words
 unhone kaha tha ki usne epabiai sahit sabhi ko bevakoof banaaya he
 In an emotional appeal, defense attorney Patrick Blagden said that his client was a religious man whom Headley betrayed and used to carry out terrorist activities
 unhone kaha ki rana ek saamaanya vyapaaree tha jo apana vyapaar mumbai, lahore, karachi or denmark sahit videshon main failaana chahta tha
 He said Headley defrauded Rana by using his business expansion plans and used his business to serve the terrorist interests of both ISI and lashkar-e-taiba

 bareli kii barfi or luka chuphi fame actress kriti senon ne filmon ke safalataa kii credit ko lekar bollywood main bahes kii shuruyaat kii he
 Apart from credit, fees based on gender are also a big question for entertainment industry
 powerful becoground se na aane vaali femail actors ke maamle main yah dekhne main aata he, film hit hone ke baad mail actors ko credit diya jaataa he
 While a few actresses are omitted, most female actors get extremely low fees compared to their male actors
 pichley maheene relies hui luka chuphi kii saxes ke baad kriti senon ne bollywood main isi trend ko lekar sawaal uthaae
 Actually, Kriti looked annoyed at not getting equal credit for Karthik Aryan in Luka Chuppi
 unhone kaha, "jab ek film ko mail or femail actress donon milakar chalaa rahe hai, to sara credit mail star ko kyon milen?" kriti kaa sawaal puri tarah jaij he
 Kriti has done many excellent films in her short career so far
 luka chuphi kii baat karen to kriti kisi bhi maamle main karthik aryan yaa duusare actors se kam nahin hai
 The space of his character is also seen in the film
 karthik ke mukaable acting or parformens main kahin se bhi kriti kamjor nahin hai
 Then what is the reason for not giving credit to the work? While Kriti Sanon has given hit films like Dilwale, Heropanti, Bareilly Ki Barfi
 kya isaki vajah bollywood main out sidar femail star hona to nahin he? agar aisa nahin he ki damdaar kaam ke baavjood kriti jaisi heroin kii taareef us tarah se nahin kii ja rahi he jisaki wo hakdaar hai
 Actually, if you look at Sara Ali Khan who did just two films or Jahnavi Kapoor who does just one film, then her praise is seen as a bridge
 lagbhag sabhi 'ilit critics' ne donon kii filmon or kaam ko hathonhaath liya or unhen bhavishya kii star qaraar de diya
 Whereas Simba had nothing to do as an actress for Sarah
 par unhen bhi ranvir singh ke saath credit de di gai
 Kangana has for a long time been accused of siblings and promoting each other in Bollywood
 fees ko lekar kai femail actors ne sawaal uthaae hai
 It was even reported that Deepika Padukone had given up the film due to low fees
 sonam kapur bhi industry main actraces ke saath ho rahe bhedbhaav par hairaani jataa chuki hai
 Kriti also spoke about the gender pay in Bollywood
 unhone kaha "meraa maananaa he ki selary kaa do chizon ke saath talmail hona chahie
 The first is your role in the film and the ability to pull the audience to the theater
 " ab jab ek femail actor bhi apane kandhe par film lekar chal rahi he, aise main use credit dena jaij he
 The question of Kriti Sanon cannot be misunderstood

 Video: jab pradhanmantri ne dilaai 'svachh bharat' kii shapath Protests have started against the three-member committee formed on the directions of the Supreme Court in the IPL spot-fixing and betting case
 is maamle par board ko court main ghaseetne vaale gaiyrmanyata praapt cricket association of bihar ke pramukh aditya verma ne samiti kaa virodh karte hue sibiai yaa enie main se kisi ek se maamle kii jaanch kii maang kii he
 During the emergency meeting of the board held here on Sunday, it was decided to suggest names of former Indian all-rounder Ravi Shastri, former Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court JN patel and former CBI Director RK Raghavan as members of the inquiry committee
 
 board ke purv adhyaksh shashaank manohar ne vidarbha cricket sangh ke pratinidhi ke taur par baithak main hissaa liya
 It is learned that the name of former Speaker of Lok Sabha Somnath Chatterjee was also considered in the meeting but later the Working Committee selected the above three people
 supreme court ne 16 april ko maamle kii pichhali sunwaayee ke dauraan ipel chah spot phixing or sattebaaji prakaran kii nishpaksh jaanch ke liye logon ke naam kaa suzav dene ko kaha tha
 The Supreme Court is likely to consider bcci's suggestion during the next hearing on 22 April and order on the future course of investigation
 board se manyata praapt kuch ikaayiyon ne supreme court ke aadesh ke baad kaary samiti kii apaat baithak bulaane kii maang kii thi jiske baad yah baithak bulaai gai
 The Supreme Court said on 16 April that the BCCI should investigate against n Srinivasan and 12 others in a betting and spot-fixing case to maintain their institutional autonomy as the court could not turn a blind eye to the allegations leveled by the Justice Mukul Mudgal Committee 
 nyaayamurti eke patnayak or nyaayamurti efem ibrahim khaliphulla kii bench haalanki esaiti yaa sibiai se jaanch karaane ke paksh main nahin thi
 The bench had said that it is necessary to maintain the institutional autonomy of the BCCI and that a committee constituted by the BCCI will be given priority to look into this issue
 bhartiya janata party ne loksabhaa or uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main bhale hi muslim ummidavaaron ko na utaara ho, lekin nagar nikaay chunaav main muslimon ko tikat dekar sabko chaunkaa diya he
 BJP has given tickets to many Muslim candidates from the state capital Lucknow to Narendra Modi's parliamentary constituency Varanasi
 kaha ja rahaa he kiyogi adityanath is maamle main modi kaa gujarat modekepana rahe hai or unhone apane is daanv se dharmanirepakshata kaa dam bharne vaale dalon congress, sapa or basapa kaa khel bigaad diya he
 When Narendra Modi came to power in Gujarat, in the 2007 Municipal Body elections, BJP fielded hundreds of Muslim candidates, out of which more than 200 councilors were able to win
 iske alaava 2012 ke nagar nikaay chunaav main bhi bijepi ke tikat par kareeb 200 parshad jeetne main safal rahe the
 Many of these also made the BJP chairman
 gujarat ke is model ko ab upi main mukhyamantri yogi adityanath bhi apana rahe hai
 In the districts of UP, where the Muslim population is above 30 percent, BJP has also placed bets on Muslim faces in this municipal elections
 bijepi ne unnav kii kurmath nagar panchayat main abbul gafoor khan, meerut kii shahjahanpur nagar panchayat se aaysha khan or bijanour kii saraspur nagar panchayat se nisha parveen ko adhyaksh pad kaa ummidavaar banaaya he
 Najma Begum will contest the election from Bharagain Nagar Panchayat of Kasganj
 bijepi pravaktaa chandramohan kaa kahana he ki mukhyamantri yogi adityanath par sampradayikta kaa aarope lagane waalon ko apane girebaan main jhaankna chahie
 Our government is following the mantra of Sabka Saath and Sabka Vikas, in which no section will be left behind
 bijepi ne teen talaak jaise mudde ko uthaakar haal hi main hue vidhansabha chunaav menmuslim mahilaonke vot batore the
 He has placed more bets on Muslim women in municipal elections
 raibareli jile kii oonchaahar nagar panchayat ke ward number do kii bijepi ummidavaar shaheen bano kahati hai ki bijepi ne muslim ummidavaaron ko tikat dekar saraahneey kadam uthaaya he
 This will make the Muslim society even more rapidly associated with the BJP
 aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay ke professor mo
 Sajjad says - BJP is the multi-purpose reason behind giving tickets to Muslims in UP municipal elections
 bijepi janaadhar or lokapriyata ko lekar sankat ke daur se guzar rahi he, kyonki sarkaar ne apane kiye hue vaade main abhi tak asafal rahi he
 In such a situation, the party will want to expand to establish itself in a new way, which is why Muslims have been given tickets
 sabhi partiyaan jitau ummidavaar ko dekhakar tikat detii hai
 In the municipal elections of UP, BJP will be seen as a Muslim candidate Jitau, which is why he has given the ticket
 iske peeche ye bhi uddeshy he ki party main sarv samaaj kii bhaagedari he
 Sajjad says that there are many such municipal bodies in western UP, where only Muslim can win
 aise main bijepi kaa uddeshy apni upasthiti darj karnaa bhi ho saktaa he
 Also in the West Muslims are enabled to contest elections
 bijepi ne gujarat main bhi pichley kuch chunaav se nagar nikaay main muslim ummidavaar utaare the or wo jite bhi lekin juhapura aaj apni bebasii par rota he
 In such a situation, what will change in Muslims by winning from BJP in UP
 purv saansad eliyas azmi kehete hai ki nagar nikaay chunaav main tikat dene se koi arth nahin he
 It is just pretense and mine
 darasal bijepi ko jahaan tikat dena chahie vahaan wo muslimon ko tikat nahin detii he, jahaan wo jitkar jaae or desh pradesh kii niti banaanen main apni bhaagedari dikhaaen
 He said that Muslim candidates are keen to win on their own in the municipal elections
 pichley chunaav main kareeb 300 muslim nagar nikaay main jeetne main safal rahe hai
 In such a situation, the BJP has not done its favor by giving them tickets

 Major Gogoi was allowed by the army to answer the questions arising from many people on his action
 media ke saamne aakar gogoi ne kaha ki 9 april ko badgam jile ke utaligam main ek matdaan centre main surakshakarmiyon ke ek chote se samooh ko kareeb 1200 patharbaajon ne gher liya tha or yadi unhone firing kaa aadesh diya hota to kam se kam 12 jaane jaatin
 Gogoi, who was honored by the Army Chief on Monday, said that some 1,200 stone-pelting personnel and some polling personnel of the indo-tibetan Border Police (ITBP) were surrounded and reported to be 'in distress' when he and 5 others Thalasnik visited the polling station
 unhone kaha ki bheed main mahilaayein or bachche bhi shaamil the or ve matdaan centre ko aag ke hawaale karne kii dhamkee de rahe the
 Gogoi said that in the midst of the crowd he saw a man who looked like a 'leader' as he was 'inciting' the stonemasons in Utligam
 sainya adhikari ne kaha ki faruk ahamed daar naam ke shaks ko jeep ke bonut se baandhne kaa vichaar unke dimag main achaanak kaundha taaki matdaan karmiyon or ardhsainik bal ke javaanon ko vahaan se surakshit baahar nikaala ja sake or kisi ko kisi tarah kaa nuksaan bhi nahin ho
 He said the stonewalling stopped for some time after Dar was tied to the jeep and this allowed polling personnel and paramilitary personnel to get out safely
 badgam jile main apane birwaah camp main patrakaron se baatcheet main ghatana kii vistaar se jaankaree dete hue gogoi ne bataaya, ‘‘maine sirf sthaneey logon ko bachaane kii khatir aisa kiya
 If i had fired, i would have lost more than 12 lives

 '' jammu-kashmir police ne kaha ki maamle kii jaanch jari he, kyonki praathmiki nirast nahin kii gai he
 The Army's Court of Inquiry is also running

 However, Dar is not happy with this
 jaanch ke bare main unhone kaha, ‘‘yah puri tarah chhalaava he
 "he was never serious," said Dar

 This famous Punjabi song has been shown in reality by Ekambir Kaur, resident of 'deep Singh Wala' village of Faridkot, has proved that what a human being can do if he wants to do something
 aaj puure faridakot main ekambir kii charchaa he
 Ekambir scored 86 per cent in the Class x examination
 ekambir kaa sapana he ki vah ek ipies afasar bane
 Handling after his father's illness is Ekambir's house in Deep Singh Wala village, located about 35 km from Faridkot
 unke pita gurbir singh kisaan hai
 About 5 years ago, due to deteriorating health of Gurbir Singh, his condition was no longer such that he could do farming work himself
 ghar main koi betaa nahin hone kii vajah se gurbir singh kii donon betiyaan unke haath banakar saamne ai
 According to Gurbir Singh's wife Swarn Kaur, she is proud that she got such daughters
 ekambir samet donon betiyon ne maa ke saath ghar or kheti kaa sara kaam sambhaal kiya
 The eldest daughter had to go to Ferozepur to study, then all the responsibility of handling the family came to Ekambir
 ekambir subah jaldi uth kar khet jaati
 Ekambir himself learned everything from driving a tractor, to watering the field, to plowing the crop, to harvesting
 khet par subah kaam karne ke baad ekambir padhai ke liye skool jaati

 sabhi log ekambir kii mehnat kii tarif karte nahin thakte
 The story of Ekambir is a slap in the face of those who discriminate between sons and daughters, and in the desire of sons, the daughters are strangled in the womb

 arundhati roy kaa lekhan kisi alahada parichay kaa muhtaaj nahin
 Not only did he win the Booker Prize for his first English novel, 'the God of Small Things', but he made an impact on literature around the world through translation
 unki yah kitaab hindi main 'maamuli chizon kaa devtaa' naam se chhapi
 Arundhati trained as an architect, but left her mark as a writer, anthropologist agitator
 kehete hai unhone do filmon ke liye patakathaayen likhin or do filmon main abhinay ke saath-saath production diziner kii bhoomika bhi nibhaai
 His other books include 'algebra of Infinite Justice' and 'an Ordinary Person's Guide to Empire'
 unka taaja upanyaas 'da ministry of atmost happines' angreji chhapane va charchit hone ke baad 'apaar kushi kaa gharaana' naam se hindi or 'bepanaah shaadamaani kii mamalikat' ke naam se urdu main chapa
 On the occasion of the release of this book, Arundhati herself said, "although my book has been translated into 49 languages of India and abroad so far
 phir bhi hindi or urdu main aane ke baad hi mere liye yah puri hui
 
 
 Anyway, it took a long time to write 'the Ministry of Almost Happiness'
 ise likhnaa mere liye ek paheli ko sulajhane jaise tha
 Truly the 'house of immense happiness' takes us on many years of journey
 is kitaab kaa parichay dete hue prakaashak raajakmal prakaashan ne apni website or amejan par kuch yon likhaa haihyah ek aisi kahani he jo varshon puraani dilli kii tang bastiyon se khulti hui falte-phoolate nae mahanagar or usase dur kashmir kii vaadiyon or madhya bharat ke jangalon tak ja pahunchati he, jahaan yuddh hi shanti he or shanti hi yuddh he, or jahaan bich-bich main halaat saamaanya hone kaa elaan hota rahata he
 Anjum, who was formerly Aftab, puts her telegram in a graveyard in the city and calls it her home
 ek aadhi raat ko footpath par kooday ke hindole main achaanak ek bacchee prakat hoti he
 Mystical s
 tilottama usase prem karanevaale teen purushon ke jivan main jitani upasthit he utani hi anupasthit rahati he
 'the house of immense happiness' is simultaneously an expression of sad love story and unquestioned resistance
 use fusfusaahaton main, chikhon main, aansuon ke zariye or kabhi-kabhi hansee-mazaaq ke saath kaha gaya he
 His heroes are those who have been broken by the world in which they live and then remain on the strength of love and hope
 isi vajah se ve jitne ispati hai utane hi bhangur bhi, or ve kabhi aatm-samarpan nahin karte
 This compelling, brilliant book reimagines in a new way what a novel can and does happen
 arundhati roy kii kahani-kala kaa karishma iske har panne par darj he
 For the readers of Sahitya Aaj Tak, an excerpt from 'aapar Khushi Ka Gharana', a Hindi translation of Arundhati Roy's famous novel, 'the Ministry of Almost Happiness', xxrep 4 * down on the sidewalk, on the banks of Jantar Mantar, where our child descended, There was a lot of crowd in the morning
 communist, deshadrohi, algaavvaadi, krantikari, swapndarshi, aalsee, siraphire, nashedi, har tarah ke freelansar or gyani log ird-gird jamaa the, jo navjaat shishu ke liye koi uphaar nahin laa sake the
 Due to a new spectacle in the city for the last ten days, they were all removed and removed from what was once their own territory
 - shahar main yahi ek jagah thi, jahaan ikattha hone kii unhen ijazat thi
 More than twenty TV teams had their cameras on the yellow cranes round the clock to guard the new shiny star: they were an old, chubby Gandhian, rural-social-activist-turned-ex-soldier, Who announced a fast unto death to realize the dream of corruption-free India
 ve kisi rugn sant kii tarah peeth ke bal pasre hue the or unke peeche bharatmata kii tasviir lagi thi
 - a multi-breasted goddess within the map-shaped figure of India (undoubtedly undivided India, which also featured Pakistan and Bangladesh)
 unki har usaans kaa, chaaron taraf jamaa logon ko die jane vaale unke fusfusaate nirdeshon kaa raat-din sidhaa prasaaran hota tha
 The old man had recognized the trend of the wind
 shahar ke punajargran kaa yah mausam ghotaalon kaa bhi mausam tha- koyala ghotaalaa, kaccha loha ghotaalaa, houseing ghotaalaa, beemaa ghotaalaa, stamp paper ghotaalaa, phone license ghotaalaa, bhoomi ghotaalaa, band ghotaalaa, sinchai ghotaalaa, hathiyaar or gola-barood ghotaalaa, petrol pump ghotaalaa, polio vaxin ghotaalaa, bijli bill ghotaalaa, paathya-pustak ghotaalaa, sadhu-sant ghotaalaa, akaal raahat ghotaalaa, car number ghotaalaa, voter list ghotaalaa, pahchaan patr ghotaalaa- or un sabamein netaaon, vyapaaree-netaaon or netaa-vyapaariyon ne saarvajanik dhan kii acolpaneey lutpaat kii thi
 Like a good treasure hunter, Brouhau had caught a high quality scandal, which was very angry with people, and this made him a nightly messiah that he himself did not expect
 bhrashtachar-mukt samaaj kaa unka swapn ek aisi khushnuma charaagaah tha jahaan har kisi ko- bhale vah kitna hi bhrasht ho- thodi der charne kii chhot thi
 All those people who had nothing to do with each other (left, right wing, cultless), all started flocking towards them
 jaise kisi agyaat se unka achaanak avatarit hona us nai or baichaiyn peedi ko prerit karne or ek uddeshy dene laga, jo ab tak itihaas or raajnneeti se anjaan thi
 The youth, wearing jeans and T-shirts, accompanied the guitar and vocals playing anti-corruption
 ve apane saath jhande or takhtiyaan bhi laate, jin par enf iz enf! or and karpshan nau likhaa hota
 a team of professional youth - lawyers, accountants and computer programmers - was formed to manage this phenomenon
 unhone paise ugaahe, bada-sa tent or bahut-sa tamzam jutaya jisamen bharatmata kii tasviir, rashtriya dhvaj kii supplai, gandhi tapiyaan, binar, digital media abhiyaan jaisi chizein thim
 Olde's pastoral speeches and speeches went well on Twitter and dominated Facebook
 tivi camaron kii bhukh lekin tab bhi nahin mit rahi thi
 Retired bureaucrats, police and military officers also joined it
 bheed badhati gai
 Budhu was instantly pleased with the stardom
 isane unhen thodaa phula diya or thodaa aakraamak bana diya
 He felt that his style was being blocked and popularity was falling due to being confined only to the issue of corruption
 unhone sochaa ki ve itnaa to kar hi sakate hai ki prashansakon ko thodaa apane mul swabhaav, apane asli tatv or janmajaat dehati akl kii ghutti pilaayein
 And thus began a circus
 unhone elaan kiya ki ve bharat kaa doosraa swadhinata sangram ched chuke hai
 His shambling speeches in his aged hair and hair sounded as if two balloons were rubbing together
 lekin ve desh kii aatma ko choote hue lagate the
 Like the wizard of the children's birthday party, he would perform many tricks and get a gift in the blink of an eye
 unke paas harek ke liye kuch na kuch tha
 He called the old and controversial war cry 'vande Mataram!' Through this, energy was transmitted to the Hindu fundamentalists (who were already happy after seeing the map of Bharatmata)
 is par jab kuch musalamaanon ko diqqat hui to unki cameti ne bombai se ek musalmaan filmi abhinayta ko bulaayaa jo namaazi topi pahanakar (vah aamtaur par pahentaa nahin tha) anekta main ekta ke pratik kii tarah ek ghante se bhi zyaada vaqt budhu ke saath manch par baitha rahaa
 Budhu used to quote Gandhiji to woo the traditionalists
 ve kehete ki jati vyavastha main hi bharat kii mukti he
 'every caste should do the work for which it is born, but every work must be respected
 ’ jab dalit isse agbabula hue to ek municipal safaikarmi kii choti-si bacchee nai frock pahanaakar laai gai or use unki bagal main bithaaya gaya
 He had a water bottle in his hand, so the old man kept drinking water in between
 ugr naitiktavaadiyon ke liye budhu kaa naaraa tha -choron ke haath kaat dene chahie
 Terrorists should be hanged
 har rang ke rashtravaadiyon ke samarthan main ve garaje : 'doodh maangoge to kheer denge, kashmir maangoge to cheer denge!’intervyuu dete samay unki muskaan ferex-shishu jaisi lisalisi ho jaati or ve us kushi ko bhi saajha karnaa nahin bhoolatey jo unhone gaanv ke mandir se sate hue apane kamare main saadagi or brahmacharya kaa jivan jite hue pai thi
 He did not forget to say that Gandhiji's celibacy-practice gives him the power to fast
 pramaan ke liye unhone upwas ke tisare din apane bistar se uthakar safed dhoti-kurte main manch par daud lagaai or banhon kii narm machhliyon kaa pradarshan bhi kiya
 People were delighted and brought their children to seek their blessings
 television darshakon kii sankhya aasmaan chune lagi
 There was a flood of advertisements
 aisa unmaad kam se kam pichley bees saalon main tab se dekhne ko nahin mila tha, jab aise hi ek chamatkaari din sari duniya ke mandiron main bhagwaan ganesh kii murtiyon ke ek saath doodh pine kii khabaren ai thim
 But now it was the ninth day of the fast of old age, and despite all the accumulated semen inside them, they started looking thin
 us din dopaher baad shahar main unke bheetar cretenin kii maatra badhane or kidney kamazor padane kii afawaah faili
 a crowd of veterans hovered around his bed
 unhone unke haath apane haathon main lekar photo khinchvaae or (haalaanki kisi ko aisi ashanka nahin thi) unase jivit rahane kaa anurodh kiya
 The industrialists who were named in the scams donated their campaign and sang the virtue of old age's unwavering faith in non-violence (their hand-cutting, hanging and disinformation were considered just warnings)
 budhu ke jo apekshaakrit khate-pite prashansak the, jinhen jivan kii bhautik sukh-suvidhaayen praapt thim, unhone kabhi apane bheetar adrinaline kaa aisa jowar mahasoos nahin kiya tha, jo kisi jan-andolan main shaamil hone par ek garvile gusse ke rup main uthta he
 They would come waving the national flag on cars and motorcycles and singing patriotic songs
 bharat ke aarthik karishme ke maseehaa, pinjaraaband khargosh kii sarkaar ko to lakva maar gaya tha
 In distant Gujarat, Lalla of Gujarat saw a divine sign in the descent of an old child
 ve shikari jaisi achook sahajata se apane dilli kooch main tezi laane lage
 On the fifth day of the fast of old age, Lalla (symbolically) had a barricade at the entrance of the city
 unke ugr jannisar jantar-mantar par chaa gaye
 He overwhelmed the old age by giving strong support
 unke jhande dusron se kahin zyaada bade or geet kahin zyaada tej awaz vaale the
 They opened counters there and distributed free food to the poor (they had a lot of money given to Lallapati Baba, Lalla's supporters)
 unhen nirdesh tha ki maathe par khaas bhagava patte nahin pahanenge, bhagava jhande nahin laharaayenge or bhuulakar bhi gujarat ke hriday-samraat kaa naam nahin lenge
 This proved to be effective
 kuch hi dinon main unhone takhta-palat kar diya
 Professional youth who worked hard to bring glory to old age were made to walk in such a way that they - even old age - could not understand what happened
 vah khushnuma charaagaah dhwast ho gai or kisi ko pataa nahin chalaa
 Now the cage rabbit was about to enter
 jaldi hi hindu hriday-samraat ko dilli par chadhaai kerani thi
 People with masks like their faces were about to be put on their shoulders and chant their names - Lalla, Lalla, Lalla - and they were about to sit on the throne
 ve jidhar bhi dekhte, udhar khud ko hi pate
 The new emperor of India
 ve ek samudr the
 Were infinity
 khud maanavtaa the
 But all this had to happen a year later
 philhal unke samarthak jantar-mantar par sarkari bhrashtachar ke khilaaf chikh rahe the (murdaabaad, murdaabaad!)
 At night they would go home and watch their pictures on TV
 agali subah jab tak ve waapas nahin aate, budhu or unke kuch samarthakon kaa 'kor group’ us vishaal laharaate hue tambu ke neeche viraan nazar aata jahaan hazaron kii bheed samaa sakati thi
 Another well-known Gandhian activist sat on a fast unto death on behalf of thousands of peasants and tribals in a fixed place under the scattered branches of the old tamarind tree, against the anti-corruption pavilion
 sarkaar ne unki zaminein chin lee thim or unhen vah bengal main ek bandhua kism kii koyala khadaan or thermal power sanyantr lagane ke liye ek petrochemical corporation ko dene ja rahi thi
 Although she was a beautiful looking woman with long attractive hair, TV people had little choice compared to old age
 iskaa kaaran rahasyamay nahin tha
 Most of the television channels were owned by the petrochemical corporation and it also used to advertise heavily to other channels
 isiilie naaraaz vishleshak tivi studio main mehmaan ke taur par aakar unki bhartsana karte or taane kasate ki unhen ek 'videshi takat’ se paisa miltaa he
 These analysts and journalists were also on a significant payroll of the corporation and left no stone unturned to serve their owners
 lekin futapaath par jamaa log mahila netaa se pyaar karte the
 Khichdi-bearded farmers shove mosquitoes off their faces
 hatti-katti kisaan auraten unke pairon kii maalish karatin or pyaar se unhen dekhti
 
 nae-nae kaaryakarta, jinamein se kai europe or america ke yuva chaatr the, deele-dhaale hippie kapade pahane hue apane laptop par unke lambey-chaude press release taiyaar karte
 Many intellectuals and conscious citizens, sitting on the ground, spoke about the rights of the farmers who had been fighting for their rights for many years
 videshi vishvavidhyalayon main saamaajik andolanon par kaam karne vaale (ek behad chaheta vishay) shodh-chaatr kisaanon ke lambey-lambey intervyuu lete or raahat mahasoos karte ki unka fildwork khud hi shahar aa gaya he or unhen dhur dehaat main jane kii takaleef nahin uthaani pad rahi he jahaan na to shauchalay hai or na filter kaa pani miltaa he
 Dozens of bodyguards, dressed in non-military clothing, but wearing military haircut (small pens back and forth) and military socks and shoes (grizzled socks, brown boots) were scattered among the crowd and spied all the conversation openly
 Were
 
 Some of them were recording a conversation with a small handycam, describing themselves as journalists
 videshiyon par unka zyaada dhyaan tha (unamem se kaiyon ke visa jaldi hi radd kar die jane vaale the)
 The air was further heated by the bright lights of the TV cameras
 un par patingon ke aatmghaatee daston kii bauchhaar ho rahi thi or raat jaale hue patingon kii gandh se bhar gai thi
 Out of those lights, some fifteen handicapped people, who were sad and tired of begging on a long hot day, were hovering in the dark and with their folded backs and corpse limbs resting on hand-rickshaws from the government Were
 visthapit kisaanon or unki mashhoor netaa ne unhen futapaath kii sabase thandi or chhayaadaar jagah se bedagal kar diya tha, jahaan pehle unka baseraa tha
 So his sympathies were with the petrochemical industry
 ve chaahate the ki kisaanon kaa andolan jaldi khatm ho taaki ve apni jagah par laut saken
 Just a few minutes away, a man bare to the waist had glued yellow lemons with glue all over his body, and a small box was stirring a thick mango drink
 vah iskaa koi jawaab nahin detaa tha ki vah twachaa par neembu kyon chipkaae hue he yaa agar vah neembu kaa prachaar kar rahaa he to aam kaa zeus kyon pi rahaa he
 When he asked this, he started abusing ek doosraa freelansar, jo khud ko 'parformens artist’ kahata tha, suut or taai or english bouler hat pahane hue jaise kisi khaas makasad se gum rahaa tha
 From afar, his suit looked as if a kebab was printed on it, but upon getting closer, it was found that they are well-worn lendsies
 uske collar par tankaa hua sookhaa gulab kaala pad gaya tha or upree jeb se ek tikona safed roomaal jhaank rahaa tha
 When asked what his message was, he used to be patient, contrary to the savagery of the lemon-human, that his body was his medium and he wanted to tell the so-called 'civilized' society that hatred should not be hated and that It should be understood that Pakkhana is nothing but processed food (and the opposite is also true)
 usne yah bhi bataaya ki vah kala ko sangrahalayon se baahar nikaalkar 'janata’ ke saamne laana chahta he
 Book excerpt: House of immense happiness: Arundhati Roy Translation: Manglesh Dabral Price: 399 Rupiah Number: 430 pakistan ke sabase bade shahar karachi ke jinna antarrashtriya airport par ravivaar raat hue aatankwaadi hamale ko dekhte hue dilli sthit indira gandhi antarrashtriya airport (aijiie) ke donon terminlon par somvaar ko suraksha badha di gai he

 They have been advised to be vigilant and keep a close watch in view of any suspicious activity
 ek police adhikari ne bataaya ki hawaondde kii bahari suraksha ke liye javabdeh dilli police pakistani hawaondde par hue hamale ke baad or satark ho gai he
 a 19-year-old youth came under a cement mixing truck near the Delhi Metro construction site in Jasola, capital Delhi
 is ghatana kaa sthaneey or uske parivaar ke sadasyon ne virodh kiya or mathura road par kai ghante tak jam laga diya
 Police said that a truck drove from Shadab, working in a private company in Noida, at around 11
30 pm
 police adhikari ne bataaya ki use ames ke trama centre le jaaya gaya, jahaan par uskaa ilaaj kiya gaya
 After his identity was confirmed, his family members were informed
 police ne bataaya ki noida ke ek nijee company main kaam karne vaale shadaab par se raat lagbhag 11 baj kar 30 minute par ek trek chalaa gaya
 The police officer said that he was taken to the Trauma Center in AIIMS, where he was treated
 uski pahchaan sunishchit hone ke baad uske parivaar ke sadasyon ko isaki soochna di gai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's emphasis is on teaching daughters
 lekin madhya pradesh ke khargon se duusari hi tasviir saamne aa rahi he
 Girls from 7 villages here want to study, but they are forced to leave their studies after they do not have school after tenth standard
 tampo par lad ke skool jate hai bacchekhargon jila headquarter se mahaj 15 kilometre kii duuri par sthit he dongargaanv
 The children here have to study in the city of Khargone
 bas seva niyamit nahin hone kii vajah se bacchon ko padhane ke liye har din tampo par lad kar khargon janaa padataa he
 In packed tampos, the boys even stand on the back and walk away
 lekin ladkiyaan aisa nahin kar saktin
 Four schools change up to 12th education
 This is the condition of Dongargaon that children have to change four schools for education up to 12th standard
 aisa karnaa unki majaburi he
 There is only a school in this village till 5th
 5veen ke baad bacchon ko 8veen tak padhane ke liye dedh kilometre dur choti thibgaanv kaa rukh karnaa padataa he
 After this, for the 9th and 10th, the elderly have to walk 3 kilometers daily
 yahaan tak to kisi tarah bachche sah lete hai
 But the real problem is to continue studying after 10th standard
 bachche pehle dongargaanv se cycle se choti thibgaanv tak jate hai
 Then bicycles stand there and reach Khargone with tampos, trucks etc
 tempo savaariyon ko is tarah bhar lete hai ki har vakt haadase kaa khatra bana rahata he
 In the afternoon only one bus passes through these villages
 aise halaat main dongargaanv ke saath-saath khedi, thibgaanv, avkuchha, bid, nagarda or rampura gaanvon kii saikadon bacchon ne skool janaa chhod diya
 Most of them are girls, who are forced to do chulha chowka or grazing of cattle
 madhya pradesh sarkaar kii ore se har 3 kilometre par skool ke daawey kiye jate hai
 But the ground reality of the villages of Khargone is telling a different story
 ab ye mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko dekhnaa hoga ki kaise padhengi yahaan kii betiyaan
 In Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar district, a young man committed suicide by jumping into a pond
 hatya ke peeche kii vajah abhi tak saaf nahin ho pai
 Police is investigating the case
 yah ghatana jile ke mirapur kasbe kii he
 25-year-old Aaron, who lives here, reached the pond in the town last evening and suddenly jumped into the water
 kuch der baad hiyuvak kii maut ho gai
 a police officer of the district said that the youth committed suicide by jumping into a pond
 is kadam ke peeche kaa kaaran abhi saaf nahin he
 Aaron's body has been recovered and sent for postmortem
 maamle kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 input language sant singh chatwaal ko padam puraskaar diye jane ko lekar vivaad ke saath hi sarkaar ne is maamle main sthiti spasht karne ke liye aage badhkar kaha ki puraskaar dene se pehle kaaphi soch-vichaar kiya gaya tha or anivaasee hotel vyavsaayee ke khilaaf vittiya aniyamittaaon ke teenon maamle sibiai ne band kar diye the
 Giving an unusual explanation, the government said that some of the media reports about Padma Bhushan being given to Chatwal were called to his attention
 yahaan jari bayaan main chatwaal kii america main bhartiya hiton ke ek aise athak pakshdhar ke taur par prashansa kii gai thi, jo donon deshon ke bich dwipaksheeya sambandhon ko majboot karne ke liye kaam karata rahaa he
 Chatwal was an active member of the non-resident Committee in the US, which raised support for India on the issue of the nuclear deal between members of the US Congress
 vittiya aniyamittaaon ke aaropon par sarkaar ne apane spashtikaran main kaha ki 1992 se 1994 ke dauraan sibiai ne chatwaal or kuch bank adhikariyon ke khilaaf bank of baroda or bank of india ko chuunaa lagane ke 5 maamle darj kiye the
 "three of these cases were closed by the CBI on its own, while a charge sheet was filed in 2 cases before the CBI Special Judge in Mumbai," the statement said
 in maamalon main adaalat ne chatwaal ko bari kar diya tha
 "significantly, prior to the announcement of the award, consultation is done with appropriate agencies
 bayaan main kaha gaya he, ‘‘puraskaar ke liye gathit samiti kii sifarish ke bina koi padam puraskaar nahin diya jaataa or iske liye puri tarah soch-vichaar kiya jaataa he
 '' dilli se ayodhya or lakhanu takraam mandirnirmaan ko lekar netaa maidan main kud padey hai
 Union Minister Uma Bharti has said that no one can stop the construction of the temple in Ayodhya
 uma bharti kaa yah bayaan sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat or uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke bayaan ke baad aayaa he
 Please tell that Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat had said that the government should not wait for the court's decision for the temple, bring legislation in Parliament and get Ram's temple built in Ayodhya
 vahiin yogi adityanath ne ajtak se baat karte hue kaha tha ki wo diwali ke maukey par khushkhabari lekar ayodhya ja rahe hai
 Uma Bharti said that the atmosphere created about the Ram temple has been created because there is a Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh and Narendra Modi's government at the center
 upi or centre donon hi jagah bahumat kii sarkaar he
 Uma Bharti further said that no power in the world can stop the Ram temple from being built
 ram mandir vahiin banegaa jahaan par mandir kii jameen he
 Uma Bharti said that the Yogi government of Uttar Pradesh and the Modi government at the center were formed due to the devotees of Ramlala
 ramalala ke bhakton ne jo sangharsh kiya he usee vajah se yah sarkarein hai
 So there is a lot of expectation from both governments and it is high time
 2019 se pehle ram mandir ke nirmaan par uma bharti kaa kahana he ki 2019 hi kyon, abhi to 2018 main bhi 2 maheene bache hai
 Uma Bharti says that i participated in the Ram temple movement
 maine apana kaam kiya ab main vahaan par bhavy mandir banate dekhnaa chaahati hum
 Uma Bharti then announced not to contest the 2019 elections
 unhone kaha ki vah ganga ke liye kaam karnaa chaahati hai
 However she said that she will keep doing politics
 uma bharti ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se apil kii he vah unke saath ayodhya saath chalakar shilanyas karavaaen
 All his old sins for the construction of Ram temple will be dusted off
 uma bharti ne kaha ki 2019 main bhi bijepi kii sarkaar banegi
 He has fulfilled all the promises BJP had made in 2014
 uma bharti ne kaha ki 2019 kaa chunaav bhi vikaas ke mudde par ladaa jayega

 congress is baar apane isi 'aantarik united morcha’ kii khuli ranneeti ke saath bijepi ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko chunauti dene utari he
 The impact of this new-found solidarity was also visible on the public and the crowd gathered at the Jabalpur rally and road show of September 30, which surprised the Congress leaders themselves
 ''jabalpur main hamen jitna samarthan mila, uskaa mujhe katai andaja nahin tha
 i and all the prominent Congress leaders have held 18 to 20 rallies till now and we are seeing the possibility of changing the course of politics from everywhere
 ” vyast chunavi daure ke baad dilli laute kendriya urja mantri or pradesh congress kii chunaav prachaar samiti ke adhyaksh jyotiraditya sindhiya ne india today se baatcheet main yah baat kahi

 All the seven-eight heads of Congress are working together
 ” ve satark hai or jaanate hai ki yah congress he, yahaan saavdhaanee hati or durghatana ghati
 In fact, the challenge is very tough and if the success is not successful, it will not be easy for anyone
 is bare main kamalnath kehete hai, ''main mukhyamantri pad kii res main nahin hum, lekin kaha gaya to mukhyamantri banane se inkaar bhi nahin karuunga
 "kamal Nath, who was appointed as the coordinator of all the electoral committees, is taking a step forward in bringing Congress leaders on one platform
 unki saavdhaanee galat nahin he, agar pichley do vidhansabha chunaav ke aankadon par najar daalen to congress vot pratishat ke lihaaj se vahiin khadi he, jahaan use digvijay singh chhod gaye the

 Congress votes did not increase, but BJP votes did decrease
 2003 main bijepi ke paas 42
 There were 5 percent votes and 173 seats, in 2008 the figure was reduced to 38
 9 fisadi vot or 143 siton par aa gaya
 That is, BJP suffered a slight loss
 lekin ye nuksaan use congress ne nahin balki bijepi kii hi diggaj netaa uma bharti kii tatkaaleen party bhartiya janashakti party ke 5
 4 percent of the votes were reached

 People are intent on uprooting it
 ” kamalnath ne mana ki koi chaar maheene pehle unhen bhi is baat kaa andaja nahin tha ki congress kaa is tarah se maahaul ban saktaa he
 At the same time, Mohan Prakash, chief strategist of Electoral Preparations, says, "the people in the state are looking for alternatives and are looking at their future in Congress
" ” udhar, bhuriya samuhik netritv main party ke chunaav jeetne kii baat kar rahe hai
 By the way, Bhuria's claim was strong before Scindia's face was exposed
 ve adivasee netaa hai or unhone aise samay main party kii bagdor sanbhali thi jab takreeban sabhi varisht netaaon ne yah jimmedaari lene se inkaar kar diya tha
 The party has made him the chairman of the Ticket Scheduling Committee, keeping his values
 yani ummid kaa diya har dil main jalaae rakhaa he
 Actually, the Congress knows that in Madhya Pradesh it is a war of 'do or die' for it
 party ke ek varisht netaa ne kaha, ''sindhiya se lekar digvijay singh tak maine sabko samajhaayaa ki sab saath aa jaao, nahin to sab doobenge
 "the leader claims that the meetings of leaders of this stature continued late at night at his residence for nearly two months
 party hikeman ke sakht tevar or astitv bachaane kii ladaai ne aakhir sabhi ko ek ghat par pani pine ke liye majaboor kar diya
 To maintain unity, the Congress has not only kept the size of the Election Management Committee large, but has also given a role in ticket distribution to the satraps of almost every region and caste and social group
 tikat vitaran par party kii niti is baar sakht bataai ja rahi he
 The panel system for tickets has been scrapped
 sindhiya ne kaha, ''ab kshatrapon se kaha gaya he ki ve ek naam party ko saunpen or uski haar jeet kii guarantee bhi khud hi len
 There is no middle ground
 ” jivan main teen baar chunaav haar chuke, pichley lagaataar do vidhansabha chunaav haar chuke yaa pichhlaa chunaav 15,000 se adhik voton se haar chuke netaaon ko party kisi surat main tikat nahin degi
 Leaders who lost the last assembly election by less than 1,000 votes are sure of their ticket
 madhya pradesh main is samay aise saat netaa hai
 Apart from this, the party is also claiming to increase the share of youth in ticket distribution
 yani party ke tevar aakraamak hai
 In fact, the party is following the theory that since the departure of Congress in 2003, a new batch of voters has been prepared
 18 se 28 saal ke is voter ne sirf bijepi sarkaron ke kaarykaal main vot daalaa he
 In such a situation, the Congress is a new party for this voter and any dissatisfaction to this voter will be against BJP
 mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan is puri ranneeti par thandi pratikriya jaahir karte hai, ''ranneeti bananaa party kaa kaam he
 Winning or defeating elections is in the hands of the public

 "if the entire congregation of Congress has been holding rallies for the last two months, then Chauhan has roamed from village to village throughout his tenure

 Chauhan's 'jan Aashirwad' Yatra has also received good public support
 vaise bhi, india today ke 'desh kaa mizaaj’ survey (28 agast, 2013) main 57 fisadi logon ne shivaraj to 24 fisadi logon ne sindhiya ko apni pehali pasand bataaya tha
 In such a situation, will it be easy to change the wind trend in a month? Especially when the BJP has made Narendra Modi its head and saffron clouds are seen on the horizon
 agar chhitput aaropon ko chhod diya jaae to shivaraj khud bhi kaddavar or lokapriy bane hue hai
 In such a situation, the unity of the Congress will not work, but it will have to leave a panacea
 ab yah congress hi jane ki uske paas aisa baan he ki nahin

 According to which, in view of Modi's two-day visit, the Prime Minister will not clap during the address of the joint session in Bhutanese Parliament

 ham logon ne duniya ko ulajhaa liya he, ise sulajhane ke liye hamen phir se alian banakar hi dharti ko dekhnaa hoga
 For example, 'PK' comes to Earth from an unknown planet
 vah dharti ko gola kahata he
 a small ball of countless balls floating in space
 ek chota-sa gola, taaki mazahab or mulk kii simaaon ke bich ghire ham or aap apane najariye kaa vistaar kar saken
 Once we can see the earth from outside, how much we have distributed to its residents
 vidhu vinod chopra or rajkumaar hiraani kii film 'pike' apane release hone ke samay ke sandarbh ke kaaran bhi ek rochak or saahasik film ban jaati he
 This film tells that many times one has to return to life only with the help of said and known stories
 har baar kisi aasamaani kahani kii talash main ham kahani kaa sara taratamya bigaad dete hai
 Aamir Khan bets on his stardom and shows the way to talk on those topics at a time, which many people talk about these days say that there are no more people listening to such things
 aamir sabase pehle darshakon ko us zamin par le jate hai, jahaan ham sab nange khadey hai
 Deserted plains of the desert, in which even a tree is not visible
 nazar aati he ek railgadee, jo hamen jahaan hai se nikaalkar kahin or le janaa chaahati he
 Where we all have to think naked once again
 nanga hone kaa matlab us arth main nahin, jaisaa ki film ke poster ko dekhakar kai log sochane lage the
 Being naked means taking off the cover of those useless arguments and recognizing your humanity
 is film kii sarthakata us sanyog ke kaaran bhi badi ho jaati he, jab aaj hi dilli ke akhabaaron ke pehle panne par haryana main sirsa ke vivaadit tathakthith sant ram rahim kii film kaa phul pej vigyaapan chapa hua tha
 In which Ram Rahim has claimed that he is the Messenger of God, the messenger
 yah film ram rahim ne hi banaai he
 On the film's poster, you will see a saint riding a bike like a hero for the first time
 kuch hi din pehle haryana main rampal kaa garh ham sabane dhahte dekha he
 Such saints inculcate themselves above court and citizenship
 avatar ghoshit kar khud adaalat ban jate hai
 We are all surrounded by such religions and have started accepting all of them as real spirituality
 aise vakt main mumbaiya film kaa itnaa bada star apni topi us ring main oochaal detaa he, jahaan aasthaa ke naam par kehane kii himmat kamazor pad chuki he
 Where those who gather strength in the name of religion are winning
 us news ankar ke peeche trishul ghonp dete hai, jiske dard ko dhote hue vah dharmik andhvishwaas se panga lene se haath khadey kar detaa he
 Aamir is not only messing up within the film, but also in the society outside the film
 isamen news channel bhi shaamil hai, jo nirmal baba ke chamatkaari upayon kaa prasaaran karte hai or dukh nivaaran yantra bech rahe hai
 Not only this, Aamir has taken the iron in this film due to the political power and market shoplifting of such saints
 yah film ham sabko acha banaati he, hamaari dhulaai karti he
 Telling that we have put so much clothes on ourselves that we have stopped even looking at ourselves
 ek kauwe ko dikhaakar aamir kehete hai ki dekho, vah nanga he kya
 Actually, nakedness is not caused by the absence or absence of clothes
 nangapan hota he hamaare dhakoslepan main
 Aamir has the courage to fight religious superstition and hatred
 pehle bhi aisi filmein bani hai, lekin jaisaa ki maine kaha ki sandarbh se film badi hoti he
 Today statements of conversion, religious parochialism, bigotry are being heard all around
 raajnneetik satta ke dam par dharmik sanghathan gaiyr-sanvaidhanik baaten bol rahe hai
 There are no elements of humanity in his words
 jo sahi soch ke log hai, ve bhi kehete hai ki secular shabd kaa naam lene vaala koi nahin rahaa
 Our voter has also moved towards parochialism
 thik aise vakt main aamir logon main bharosa khoj lete hai ki ye vahi log hai, jinase in sab sawaalon par baat kii ja sakati he or vah kar lete hai
 Aamir also dares to say that if we did not question it, only one shoe will be left on this circle
 unke haath main us dost kaa juuta he, jo kuch der pehle railway stesan par hue bam dhamaake main maaraa jaataa he
 He is constantly searching for the thread of faith in this film
 tark ke liye jagah bana rahe hai
 a journalist comes out of this bad media to believe his words
 jaggu bani anoushka or use ek sampadak kaa saath miltaa he bajva bane boman irani kaa
 Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Rajkumar Hirani should be congratulated for daring to make such a film
 film puri tarah paariwarik he or kam se kam bacchon ko to dikhaani hi chahie, taaki ve apane aas-paas jad ho chuki tasveeron ko nae sire se dekh saken
 Film critics will continue to give it a single star or two and a half star, but watching the film with the view of an audience, everyone in the cinema hall felt as if someone had caught their pulse
 jab darshak sahamat ho jaaen or ve thodi der ke liye sahi, achche ke liye badal jaaen, tabhi koi film badi hoti he
 a film is not always big due to its craft or style, so there is no shoe left on the earth, watch this film and if you do not, then consider these questions by removing the cover of all clothes
 aisa karke bhi aap 'pike' dekh lenge

 Nitin Gadkari has said that his statement was misinterpreted as he made this statement for the banking sector and he did not comment on politics
 unhone kaha tha ki jeet ke kai hakdaar hote hai lekin vifaltaa ko koi sweekaar nahin karnaa chahta
 Union Minister Nitin Gadkari while clarifying his statement said that while talking to a bank-related event in Pune, he tried to say that the bank's leadership leadership takes credit if the bank comes to profit
 vaise hi agar bank yaa bijness ghate main chalaa jaataa he to uski jimmedaari bhi bank ke leadership ko leni chahie
 In the same way, i said that if the credit of winning elections is taken in politics, then the credit of defeat should also be taken
 mere is vaktavy ko tod marodakar pesh kiya gaya
 It had no relation to the political situation or the recent assembly elections
 unhone kaha ki bijepi pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv main chunaav ladegi or meraa vishwaas he ki unke netritv main purna bahumat praapt karegi
 It is worth noting that in an event organized by the District Urban Cooperative Bank Association Ltd
 in Pune, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said that the committee sits to review the defeat in politics, but when victory is won, no one is going to ask
 kyonki safalataa kaa shrey lene ke liye logon main hode rahati he, lekin vifaltaa ko koi sweekaar nahin karnaa chahta, sab duusare kii taraf ungali dikhaane lagate hai
 In fact, addressing cooperative bank personnel, Nitin Gadkari was giving examples that after the defeats in Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha in politics, candidates make an excuse that they did not get enough resources
 bade netaaon kii sabha maangi gai thi lekin wo bhi cancil kar di, jiske kaaran unki haar hui
 Gadkari had said that he told such leaders that you lost the election because you were lagging behind in gaining people's trust
 isliye apni haar kii jimmedaari khud len, dusron par mat daalen

 is tarah vah may 2008 main dakshin bharat main bhaajapa kii pehali sarkaar banane ke baad karnataka main party ke duusare mukhyamantri honge
 Gowda's selection is seen as a victory for the current Chief Minister's camp
 gauda ne rajyapal hansraj bharadwaj se mulaakaat kii or sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya
 According to a release issued by the Raj Bhavan on Wednesday evening, the governor has invited Gowda to form the government
 rajbhavan ke sutron ne bataaya ki shapath grahan guuruuvaar aparaahn saadhe chaar baje hoga
 Sources did not provide any information whether Gowda will take oath alone or some ministers will take oath with him
 sutron ke mutabik, bangalore main paanch agast se raashtrapati pratibha patil kaa teen divasiy daura shuru ho rahaa he
 This is why Gowda decided to take oath on Thursday, one day in advance, instead of August 5
 jab yediurppa kaa uttaradhikari aam sahmati se chunane kii bhaajapa ke kendriya netaaon kii koshishen vifal ho gayin, to pradesh bhaajapa ke pratidwandvi samoohon ke bich rassakashi ke kaaran gopneey tareeke se matdaan karana padaa
 This led to internal differences between the party
 bhaajapa sutron ne matdaan ke bare main virodhabhasi bayaan diye hai
 Some sources say that Gowda was supported by 65 mlas and Shettar by 51 mlas
 anya sutron kaa kahana he ki gauda ko 64 or shetter ko 53 yaa 54 vot mili
 However, there is no dispute that Gowda got more than 60 votes and Shettar got more than 50 votes
 yediurppa kheme ke netaaon ke anusaar, gopneey matdaan ke baad gauda ko ‘sarvasammati’ se bhaajapa vidhayak dal kaa nayaa netaa chun liya gaya
 Gowda has been the state BJP president and belongs to the Vokkaliga community
 vah sangh parivaar se aate hai or unki saaf chhavi he
 Vokkaliga is the second largest community dominating the state after Lingayat

 There is speculation that Shettar may be made deputy chief minister
 sangh parivaar se aane vaale gauda yediurppa ke kattar samarthak maane jate hai
 Gowda continued to support Yeddyurappa in every situation like the revolt of ministers and the Reddy brothers during the last two years of the rule of the first BJP government in South India
 arun jetali, rajnath singh or em venkaiya naidu jaise kendriya netaaon dwaara yediurppa ke uttaradhikari ke rup main kisi netaa kaa ‘aam sahmati’ se chayan nahin kara paane ke baad bhaajapa vidhayak dal kii baithak main gopneey matdaan karaayaa gaya
 Yeddyurappa was asked by the party high command to step down as chief minister after the Lokayukta report in the illegal mining case
 iske baad se yediurppa gauda kii ummidavaari kaa aakraamak tareeke se samarthan kar rahe the
 This led to sharp differences in the bjp's state unit
 yediurppa ne ravivaar ko istipha de diya
 Gowda, an MP from udupi-chikmagalur, has been the head of the party's state unit and has also held the post of deputy leader of opposition in the assembly
 unki chhavi vivaadon se dur rahane vaale or milansaar vyakti kii rahi he
 Soon after his selection, Gowda went to Raj Bhavan, where he handed over the resolution letter of the Legislature Party to Governor Bhardwaj, in which he was asked to elect him as the new leader
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa rajnath singh ne aashaa jataayi ki karnataka main sadanand gauda ke netritv main sthirataa aayegi or sushasan hoga
 Singh said that Gowda has been elected as the leader of the BJP Legislature Party
 unhone kaha ki rajya main sthirataa aayegi or unhen puraa bharosa he ki gauda ke netritv main karnataka sarkaar rajya kii janata ko sushasan degi

 The Babri Masjid demolition case may increase the troubles of Rajasthan Governor Kalyan Singh

 What the constitution says: However, the court asked the CBI to produce Kalyan Singh as an accused soon after his removal from the post of governor
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 361 ke tahat raashtrapati or rajyapalon ko unke kaarykaal ke dauraan aapraadhik tathaa divaani maamalon se chhot pradaan kii gai he
 Accordingly, no court can issue summons to the President or Governor in any case

 'sibiai ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya tha ki singh ne mukhyamantri ke taur par kendriya bal kaa istemaal karne kaa aadesh nahin diya

 The Delhi High Court has given a big shock to Delhi government by one of its orders
 dilli sarkaar kegetibi aspataalmen dillivaasiyon ko ilaaj main praathamikta dene vaale circular ko court ne khaarij kar diya he
 That is, no patient will be discriminated against in treatment in Delhi government hospitals
 hoicourt ne mana ki dilli sarkaar kaa circular manamaana he or medical sevaaon main bhedbhaav kisi bhi lihaaz se marijon ke saath ninsaphi he
 The High Court said that the Delhi government's order was arbitrary and irrational
 court ne apane aadesh main kaha ki dilli pan india he yani dilli desh kii rajdhani he or desh ke kisi bhi marij ko ilaaj ke liye manaa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 This circular is against the right to equality and the right to live
 isiilie ham ise radd kar rahe hai
 The court accepted the argument of the petitioner in this case that most of the patients being treated in government hospitals are poor and government hospitals are the last option for treatment
 or yahaan bhi or agar sarkaar ilaaj se manaa karti he to ye ilaaj kahaan karaayenge
 This order of the High Court will have to be implemented by the Delhi Government with immediate effect, that is, now the Delhi Government will have to immediately remove the huge hoardings from GTB Hospital in which people coming from outside were denied treatment
 agar aspataal kaa prashasan is aadesh ke baad dilli ke baahar se aae kisi bhi marij ko ilaaj se manaa karata he to yah court kii avmaananaa maani jaaegi
 The verdict from the court may be a big blow to the Delhi government but it is a great relief for the poor patients
 dilli sarkaar ne 1 oktober ko zeetibi aspataal ke liye ek circular jari kiya tha jisamen kaha gaya tha ki dilli ke voter idi card ko dikhaane vaale marijon ko hi ilaaj main praathamikta milegi
 Bed and free medicines were also stopped in this hospital for patients coming from outside Delhi
 circular ke jari hone ke baad iskaa virodh bhi shuru ho gaya or hoicourt main circular ko chunauti dene vaali yachika soshal jurist enjio kii taraf se varisht adhivaktaa ashok agarwal ne laga di
 Ranchi is the capital of Jharkhand and also the hometown of Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 lagata he, is shahar main sirf do tarah ke log hai
 One, a select few who know Dhoni; Others who keep trying unsuccessfully to know Dhoni
 pehle samooh main unke parivaar ke logon ke alaava unke bahanoi gautam gupta, purv coach chanchal bhattacharji, santosh, shabbir or gautam upaadhyaay jaise mitra hai
 This group keeps the captain's sufferings and their successes completely hidden from the public eye
 bachapan ke mitron ke liye dhoni kii garmjoshi jaraa bhi kam nahin hui he
 Team India captain Dhoni, who is known as Prem to Mahi, shares many things with his select friends in Ranchi
 ek mitra ne bhed kholaa he ki maahi ne ek baar jab ek match se khud ko jabaran vishram dilaayaa tha, tabhi se ve apane khel ke bare main vichaar kar rahe hai
 a friend further revealed, 'mahi wants to get rid of wicket keeping in Test matches
 ve chaahate hai ki jaise srilanka ne kumaar sangakaara ko keeping se mukt kar diya tha, bisisiai vaise hi unhen bhi mukti de
 If the series against Australia was fine, Dhoni would have conveyed this to the selectors
 par isaki ummid ab nahin
 Except for a half-century in the Sydney Test, he could not do anything as a batsman in the series against Australia
 keeping main bhi ausat se kahin peeche rahe hai
 Mahi's friends are upset that what they see is not visible to the board
 yah ki maahi kii hatheliyaan suji hui hai or unka dard khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahaa
 Mahi will not advocate herself
 dinesh karthik saath khel rahe the, tab bhi maahi ne keeping khud kii or dinesh ko visheshgy ballebaaj kii tarah khilne diya
 Dhoni has always led the team with confidence
 shant dimag ko maidan par unhone kabhi bekaabu nahin hone diya, bhale hi kaha jaataa rahaa ho ki plaing condishans ko lekar ve khush nahin
 But it seems, they say all the things in a very personal conversation
 england ke vidhvansak daure ke baad, jab dhoni ranchi main the tab kisi ne unki maa ke mobile par unase baat kii
 Dhoni had said with a sad heart, 'let's see how long Sir
 ran nahin banegaa to chhod denge
 Dhoni also told him that he no longer has much patience for Test cricket
 motorcycle chalaanaa unhen hameshaa pasand he, usase unki thakaavat bhi dur ho jaati he
 But ironically, they cannot run it in Ranchi
 apane ek dost se unhone kaha thah ‘ranchi main mere liye ab mere ghar kii chaharadivari hi bachi he
 i can't even ride my motorcycle
 ’ jaahir he, dhoni un najaron se naaraaz hai, jo lagaataar un par gadi rahati hai
 To express his anger, Dhoni turns his jaw right-left
 ranchi main ek puraane coach bataate hai, ‘jab ham tivi par dekhte hai ki dhoni daatan pis rahe hai, to samaj jate hai ki maahi kisi sthiti yaa insaan se naaraaz hai
 During the Test series against Australia, when Dhoni said that he would leave Test cricket by 2013 so that he would be fit for the 2015 World Cup, some of his close in Ranchi considered the statement a message to other players
 in logon kaa daawa he ki unhone is masale par team india ke captain se baatcheet kii thi
 Dhoni recently visited an old colleague's house in Ranchi
 usase unhone kaha, ‘khel kii ek style se ritair hone ke bare main agar main soch saktaa hum, to ve log kyon nahin jo pradarshan nahin kar paa rahe?’ shaayad yahi kaaran he ki australia ke khilaaf pehle twanti-20 match ke thik ek din pehle unhone yah kehete hue captaini chhodane kii peshkash kii ki ‘mujhase behatar koi mili to
 
 
 'dhoni's mother Devaki Devi had agreed with her son on this
 apane ek parichit se unhone kaha tha, ‘maahi ko captaini chhod apane khel par dhyaan dena chahie, khaskar ballebaaji par

 '' mauka tha india today agro summit and awords 2018 kaa or vastav main yah aayojan inhen kisaanon ke sangharsh or kheti-kisaani se jude logon ke sammaan kaa utsav tha
 In a welcome address, India Today editor Anshuman Tiwari made it more clear that the event has become a platform for not only honoring the agriculture sector but also a serious discussion on it
 vaaki yahaan krishi visheshgyon, kisaan netaaon or niti-niyantaaon ke vimarsh se desh main krishi or kisaanon kii vartmaan chunautiyon kii baat saamne ai to bhavishya kii raah bhi ubhari
 In his inaugural address, National Rainfed Area Authority CEO Ashok Dalwai said that people say that agriculture's share of the country's GDP is very low but it should be seen that the maximum number of people in the country are connected with agriculture sector
 swaagat bhaashan main india today ke sampadak anshuman tiwari ne ise or spasht karte hue bataaya ki yah aayojan na keval krishi kshetra ke sammaan kaa, balki us par gambhir vimarsh kaa bhi manch ban gaya he
 Indeed, in the discussion of agricultural experts, farmer leaders and policy-makers here, the future challenges of agriculture and farmers in the country came to the fore, then the road to the future also emerged
 apane udghaatan bhaashan main neshnal renfed aria athurity ke siio ashok dalwai ne kaha ki logon kaa kahana he ki desh kii jidipi main krishi kii hissedari bahut kam he lekin dekhnaa chahie ki desh main sabase zyada log krishi kshetra se jude hue hai
 He said that about 110 crore people dependent on agriculture means that without the advancement of agriculture, the country cannot become a superpower
 is kshetra ke vikaas se hi udyog or sarvice sector kaa vikaas ho sakegaa
 He emphasized, "unless the purchasing power of farmers increases, the country's economy will not grow
 ''iske baad swaraj divijan ke siio viren popeli ne jab kaha ki aaj shaharon main logon ko aipal iphone to khareednaa aa gaya he par appal (seb) khareednaa nahin aayaa he, to sabhaagaar main muskaraahat tair gai
 However, Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh did not miss out on targeting the Congress even on organizing farming
 unhone chaar saal kii uplabdhiyon ko upie ke das varshon ke kaam par baari bataaya or saath main kisaanon ke neem coted uria ke jariye kalabazari par roak kaa zikr bhi kiya
 Radha Mohan Singh claimed, "in future, 22,000 mandis will be connected to e-marketing

 However, Chaudhary countered this saying, "if debt waiver is not a complete solution, then at least it is an ointment for the farmers
 '' shekhavat ne suzav diya ki kisaanon ko pehle bazaar kii pahchaan kerani chahie, phir usee ke anuroop fasal ugaani chahie
 Opposition leaders, however, questioned the government's style of functioning
 nirupam ne kaha ki pichley 70 saal main desh main krishi par dhyaan diya gaya he
 But with this, the crisis of life of farmers has also increased rapidly
 vahiin choudhary ne sarkaar kii krishi niti par hamalaa bolaa, "modi ne kisaanon ko kaha ki aap dalhan kii paidaavaar badhaaie
 Farmers increased yields by 33 percent, you went and signed up in Africa
 haal hi main sarkaar ne notiphoi kiya he ki kareeb 2 lakh ton daalen mangavaayenge
 The farmer leader V
 em
 Singh said, "if consumers want to produce at a low price, then give it to the government, but then reduce the cost of farmers
" ''krishi visheshgy devinder sharma ne desh ke aarthik model par sawaal khadey karte hue kaha ki pichley 45 saal main gehun kii keemat yani kisaanon kii aay main mahaj 19 fisadi kii vruddhi hui he, vahiin is dauraan sarkari mulajimon kii aay (vah bhi sirf basic pe or die) main 120 se 150 guna vruddhi hui he
 The second session of the How to Get Reasonable Price Program "how to fix the price of farm produce" was also hotly debated
 dalwai ne centre sarkaar kaa paksh rakhte hue kaha ki pehle munafa or margin kaa koi maandand nahin tha
 For the first time, a government has said in the budget that farmers will be given MSP on 25 crops under A-2% FL% 50% profit margin
 vahiin saansad or kisaan netaa raju shetty ne is par sawaal khadaa karte hue kaha ki sarkaar ne e-2 main jo vaastavik mulya dene kii baat kahi he, vah bhi sahi nahin he
 He took a dig at the government and described it as the bookkeeper of Hindi films, which gives a false account
 niti ayog ke special cell on land policys ke chairman tajamul haq ne bataaya, "swaminathan ayog ne suzav diya tha ki agar kisaanon kii haalat main sudhaar karnaa he to unhen tatkaal raahat ke taur par emspi main si-2$50 pratishat margin diya janaa chahie
 At the same time, Ashwani Mahajan, associated with RSS and co-convener of Swadeshi Jagran Manch, also questioned the officials and advisors of the BJP government itself
 vahiin raju shetty ne chetavanee dete hue kaha, "jo bhi sarkaar kisaanon ke saath dhokhaa karegi, use laal kile par jane kaa sapana chhod dena chahie
