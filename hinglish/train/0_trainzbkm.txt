 pakistan ke purv sainya shaasha parvej musharraf ne jab takhtapalat kar satta sanbhali to pakistan taharik-e-insaaf se mukhiya imran khan ne musharraf kaa virodh kiya tha
 This was the first incident for the people of Pakistan when a leader opposed the army
 lekin pakistan ke aam chunaavon ke nateezon bolte hue musharraf ne imran ke samarthan main jamkar kaside padhe
 In a special conversation with Qasidejatak in support of Imran, former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf says that in his first address, Imran has said good things
 unhone padosi mulkon ke bich achche sambandh or vyapaar kii baat kii he
 Musharraf said that Imran faces a big financial challenge
 jo unke saamne bhi thim
 But the situation will change, it will not be bad
 unhone kaha ki mai sikhkar aage badha, imran bhi seekhenge or aage badhenge, vah siikhnaa chaahate hai
 There was a lot of discussion in the domestic and foreign media that the Pakistani army is behind Imran Khan
 jisane ek ek karke vahaan kii nyaaypalika kii madad se imran ke samaksh khadi hone vaali sari chunautiyon ko raste se hataa diya
 Responding to this, Musharraf said that this is being said because people understand that Nawaz Sharif was in favor of India
 imran ko fouj ne plant nahin kiya he, balki ve apane dam par jite hai
 Let me tell you that when the then General of the Pakistan Army, Pervez Musharraf became the President after a coup in the country, he promised that he would hold elections
 lekin apane kiye vaade se mukar jane ke baad musharraf ko jis pakistani netaa kaa sabase zyada virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha ve imran hi the
 Musharraf will be returning soon Speaking on former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Musharraf says that he had options to stay out but would have ended politically if he had stayed out, which is why he returned to Pakistan
 apni vatan vaapasi bolte hue musharraf ne kaha ki desh main halaat teji se badal rahe hai or ve apane mulk waapas jaaenge
 He said that i have fought the war, eaten the bullets, i have had suicide attacks, yet people say that i was scared
 pakistan ne lashkar ko nahin chunaa, hafiz sabko swikarpakistan ke chunaavon is baar badi sankhya main kattarpathiyon ke chunaav main utarane par tippanee karte hue musharraf ne kaha ki pakistan ne lashkar ko nahin chunaa, acchhee baat he, ham kattarpathiyon ko riject kar rahe hai
 However, Musharraf, while retaining his old voice, said that Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the 26 / 11 Mumbai attacks, is stuck in India's neck
 unhone pakistani chunaav main hafiz kii haar par kaha ki hafiz sabko sweekaar hai or ve mujahid hai or lashkar-e-taiyaba mujahiddeen
 Those who carry their lives on their palm
 kashmir ko lekar musharraf kaa kahana he ki bharat kashmir ke maamle ko hal nahin kar rahaa he
 Musharraf said that India is a big country, its army is also big, its strength is more, it should also keep its heart big, Pakistan is small, big country should show big heart
 haryana ke panchkula main ruchika girhotra chhedchhad maamle main haryana ke purv dijipi shanbhu pratap singh rathod ko raahat mili he

 ghutanon ke bal chalane vaala naksalwad jharkhand main aate-aate marathon kii tarah daudane laga
 Difficile naa logon kii jindagi kii chintaa, naa prashasan kii takat kaa khauf
 There are many such areas in Jharkhand, except at night, even in the day, the police shies away from going
 paanch lakh kii aabaadi vaale khunti main naksaliyon ne apana khunta aisa gaada ki cobra or siarpief ke 2000 jawan bhi naakaafi pad gaye
 See the misfortune of this state full of natural resources that the red horse of Naxalites is running in 21 of the 24 districts here
 bokaro, chatra, dhanbad, purvi singhbhum, gadwa, giridih, gumla, hazaribagh, koderma, latehar, lohardagga, palamu, ranchi, simdega, sarayakela-kharasaavaan, pashchim singhbhum, khunti, ramgarh, dumka, devgarh or pakur main naksaliyon kaa aisa asar he, ki prashasan bouna pad jaataa he
 The pain of the people comes to their mouths in Khunti, just 60 km from the capital Ranchi
 maowad kii hinsa se jangal main rahane vaale bhi dare hue hai
 After the attack on Congress leaders in Chhattisgarh on 25 May, new demands from the Naxalites started rising again
 naksali chaahate hai ki oparation green hunt band kiya jaae
 The paramilitary forces withdraw the government from the jungles
 jelon main band un naksaliyon ko sarkaar reeha kare, jise maowad ke karta-dharta maasoom adivasee bataate hai
 Also, anti-naxal laws should be abolished
 wo ye bhi chaahate hai ki prakritik sansadhano kii jaisi lut korporate jagat ne machaa rakhi he, wo khatm ho
 The Naxalite movement, born out of Naxalbari in the 1970s, progressed on the battle of the jungle-land
 ek gaanv se nikali chingaari ne dhire-dhire kam yaa zyada 16 rajyon main maowad kii aag laga di
 The pain of Bengal is still suffering
 pashchim bengal ke chaar jilon bankura, pashchim midanapur, purulia or birbhum main naksaliyon kaa dabadabaa aaj bhi bana hua he
 Naxalism spread in other states after leaving Bengal, so there are many reasons behind it
 -un rajyon main naksaliyon ne paanv jamaaye, jahaan adivaasiyon kii sankhya zyada he
 - Where most areas are forests and mountains
 -jo ilaaka prachur khanij padaarthon se bharaa hua he
 -the areas which are far from the state capitals and district headquarters
 -or jo ilaake kai rajyon kii sarhad ko jodate hai
 But the hope of fighting against all these different non-equalities also gave rise to Naxalite violence
 us par se raajnneeti kaa haath peeth par laga, to naksalwad or badha
 Naxalism has spread in 22 districts of Bihar
 ye jile hai- araval, aurangabad, bhojpur, purvi champaran, gaya, jamui, jahanabad, camoor, munger, nalanda, navada, patna, rohtas, sitamarhi, pashchim champaran, mujffarpur, shivahar, vaishali, baankaa, lakhisarai, begusarai or khagadiya
 But in the changed situation, even those who are persecuted by Naxalism, and who were once advocates of Naxalism, also believe that Naxalites have lost their way
 uttar pradesh ke teen jilon- chandauli, mirzapur or sonbhadra main laal aatank kaa asar he
 But the question is, how will the Red Corridor of Naxalism be broken from Tirupati to Pashupati
 kab tak laal aatank ko kaayartapurna karrwai kah kar shok manaata rahegaa desh? kab sirf naksalwad se ladane kaa sankalp lekar ek bade samasya kii andekhi karata rahegaa desh? 25 may ko bastar jile main naksaliyon ne itnaa bada narsanhaar kar diya lekin sarkaar ke paas acshan plan ke naam par kuch nahin
 What is the action plan Rajnath Singh is talking about? Is that the plan that Union Minister Jairam Ramesh is referring to? lekin itihaas ne bataaya he ki kameshwar baitha kaa prayog bahut kargar nahin rahaa kyonki jis vichaardhaara kii buniyaad par naksal andolan khadaa hua wo teen dashakon main apane raste se bhatak chukaa he
 They collect extortion tax from officers and contractors
 iske badale wo adivaasiyon ke shoshan se ankhen munde rahete hai
 Naxalites and gunmen in the name of Maoism oppose parliamentary democracy
 lekin pichhali baar kameshwar baitha naam ke ek naksalwadi sansad main aa gaye
 Whereas they already interfered in the assemblies and district panchayats
 ab sawaal ye he ki sansadeey loktantr ke virodh or samarthan ke bich naksali hukumat kaa koun sa rasta chaahate hai
 But the problem is at the level of the Naxalites, then the problem is also in the government's thinking
 sarkaar main baithe zyada logon ko pataa hi nahin asli samasya kya he? aakhir bhole-bhaale adivasee hathiyaar uthaane par kyon majaboor hue
 After all, why not 71,000 CRPF jawans and a large contingent of local police have been able to eliminate this red menace on the strength of gun
 naikya naksalwad ne aatankwaad kaa rup le liya he? kya naksalwadi andolan adivaasiyon ke haathon se hijank ho chukaa he? aakhir kaise lagegaa laal aatank par lagaam?agar sarkaar ko vastav main naksalwad ko khatm karnaa he to sabase pehle use eemaandaaree se maananaa padegaa ki samasya maovadiyon se nahin balki adivaasiyon se judi hui he
 This problem is of that model of development, in which nothing is left of the poor tribals
 ye or baat he ki bajet main unke naam se dher sara paisa bheja jaataa he
 That is, only development and interaction can solve the problem 
 adivaasiyon ko mukhyadhara main laane ke liye dashakon se sarkari yojanaayen chal rahi hai
 In the 11th plan itself, a budget of five hundred crores has been passed for the development of infrastructure in Naxal-affected states
 sadak, suraksha, pani, skool jindagi kii tamaam jaruraton ke liye dashakon se in ilaakon main sarkaar sainkadon karod rupee lutaa chuki he
 But ironically, a large population of Bastar lives without electricity and toilets
 aspataal jane ke liye milon chalati he or dawaaon ke liye naksaliyon par abhi bhi nirbhar he
 After all, where is all the money going? There is no one to tell you this
 yahi vajah he ki naksalwad se sahanubhuti rakhane vaale log saaf kehete hai suraksha lakh majboot kar lo samasya nahin suljhegi
 Develop the area
 naksaliyon se baatcheet karo
 However, Professor Hargopal, who has mediated the negotiations between the government and the Naxalites during Sukma's abduction of DM last year, raises a finger on the government's honesty
 hargopal kaa kahana he ki kaam nikalate hi sarkaar vaade se mukar jaati he, aise main baatcheet ke liye koun saamne aayega?saaf he har badi ghatana ke baad sarkaar koshish karti he lekin phir kadam khinch leti he
 This is the reason Naxalism has now become cancer from canker
 1980 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne pehali baar naksal samasya ke hal ke liye ek team bheji andhra pradesh or bihar main
 The member secretary of the Planning Commission at that time was leading the team
 vahi sadsy sachiv aaj desh ke pradhanmantri hai lekin teen dashak main ye rog nasoor se cancer ban gaya or iske ilaaj ke naam par agar kuch he to vahi puraane vaade or anginat team

 Though at the same time Owaisi said that he accepts that the economy was 'completely devastated' during the British rule, but he claimed that it was the opposite of that in the Mughal rule

 Shanti Bhushan's petition questioning the Master of Roster of Chief Justice will be heard on Friday
 chif justise kii bhoomika ko kathghare main rakhane vaali is yachika par justise eke sikri or justise ashok bhushan kii bench sunwaayee karegi
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak about this petition, counsel for the petitioner Prashant Bhushan stated that the Master of Roster in the Constitution does not mean arbitrary off-roster
 hamaari yachika bhi roster kii mastership ko spasht, paardarshee or niyamit karne ke liye he
 But this experience was like fighting the system
 pehle tosupreme courtki registry ne hafton hamaari yachika sirf isliye sweekaar nahin kii kyonki isamen CJI ko pakshakaar banaaya gaya tha
 Now when there is an issue of regularizing the jurisdiction of the CJI, how will it be without the parties
 badi mushkil se ye masalaa hal hua to ye samasya ai ki aakhir chif justise ke adhikaar kshetra ko chunauti dene vaale is mukademe ko ham unheen kii peeth main kaise le jaaen
 It should not even be heard by the Chief Justice
 ye sochakar ham justise chelmeshwar kii court main gaye or maamle kii sunwaayee kii guhaar lagaai
 Justice Chelameswar denied hearing the case saying that he did not want his order to be reversed within 24 hours as before
 do maheene baad main ritair ho hi rahaa hum
 He told Prashant Bhushan that Justice Chelameswar also referred to the discussion being held about him
 unhone kaha ki mere liye kaha ja rahaa he ki main kisi offis ko hathiyaane ke liye ye kar rahaa hum, lekin ye sach nahin he
 If no one worries, i won't worry too much
 desh ke itihaas ko dekhte hue main jaahir taur par is maamle ko nahin sunuunga
 After this, Prashant Bhushan mooted the case in the Chief Justice's court
 chif justise ne bench main apane saathi justise khanvilakar or justise chandrachud se mashvira kiya
 Then Chief Justice said that he would see about it
 shaam hote hote bench tay ho gai
 However, in this petition of Bhushan it has been said that the Chief Justice should not allot cases in the Supreme Court alone, but all the five judges involved in the collegium
 prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki isi supreme court ke chaar jajon ne chif justise kii manamaani ke khilaaf press conference kii thi
 If the issue was not completely resolved, then this petition had to be filed
 bataa den ki supreme court ke 4 sitting jajon justise chelmeshwar, justise ranjan gogoi, justise madan lokur or justise courian joseph ne press conference kar kaha tha ki supreme court kaa prashasan thik tareeke se kaam nahin kar rahaa he, agar aisa chalata rahaa to loktantric paristhiti thik nahin rahegi
 He said that we spoke to the Chief Justice on this issue, but he did not listen to us
 iske alaava haal hi justise chelmeshwar ne kaha tha ki agar CJI deepak mishra ke baad agar justise ranjan gogoi ko CJI nahin banaaya jaataa he to hamane jo baat kahi thi usapar shaq sahi tha
 Let us tell you that Justice Chelameswar is retiring on June 22, while Deepak Mishra will retire in the month of October

 The royal litchi of Muzaffarpur, Bihar is very good, but every year when the fruit of the litchi splashes reddish on the trees, a disease breaks on children
 haal hi main america kii ek mashhoor patrika main america vaigyanikon ke hawaale se research chapa he ki ye mautein lichi khaane se hui hai
 However, the doctor of Muzaffarpur does not agree with this
 unka kahana he ki jo peedit bachche aate hai, unamem glucose kii maatra sthir nahin rahati he, sabakaa lakshan ek jaisaa nahin hota
 Last year, the deaths of children started before the fruit of litchi came
 may or june ke maheene main mujffapur saikadon bachche biimaar padate hai or rahasyamay beemaari se saikadon bacchon kii maut ho jaati he
 Every year the summer season comes as havoc
 teen saal ke research ke baad bharat or america vaigyanik is nattejey par pahunche kii khaali pet lichi khaane se yah sandigdh beemaari bacchon main ho rahi he
 According to scientists, litchi contains a poisonous element named hypoglycine a and methylenescyclopropylglycine
 aspatal main bhartee hue zyaadaatar bacchon ke khun or peshaab kii jaanch se pataa chalaa ki unamem in tatwon kii maatra maujuud thi
 Most of the children did not have evening meal and consumed litchi in large amounts in the morning
 aisi sthiti main is tatwon kaa asar ghaatak hota he
 Malnutrition in children and being ill already increases the risk of the disease
 vaigyaniko kaa yah shodh prakashit hone ke baad eskeems ke shishu rog visheshgy doctor gopal shankar sahani ne ise ek sire se kaarij kiya he
 Dr
 Gopal Shankar Sahni tells that based on his experience that the amount of glucose is not stable in the suffering children, no symptoms remain the same
 baat lichi karen to pichley varsh lichi ke fal ped main aane se pehle hi kuch bachche usee lakshan ke aspataal aae or kuch kii maut bhi hui
 Doctors say that children between the age of three to 12 years are affected by this disease
 3 varsh kaa baccha kahaan se lichi khaataa hoga
 District District Civil Surgeon Doctor Lalitha Singh also agreed that patients suffering from glucose levels fall
 unhone bhi lichi ke vajah ko sire se kaarij kar diya
 In 2014, 390 children suffered from the disease, out of which 122 died
 jab ye beemaari aati he to netaaon kaa daura hota he research karne ke liye desh-videsh se timen aati he
 Teams from the National Center for Disease Control in Muzaffarpur and the Center for Disease Control from the United States came out during the illness and also did research in those areas for research
 sarkaar beemaari ke naam ko hi badalte rahi pehle dimagi bukhaar or phir hypoglaysemia or phir acute inseflitis syndrome rakhaa, lekin tang haqiqat ye he ki beemaari kaa pataa nahin chalaa paaya or bacchon kii maut kaa silsilaa chalata rahaa
 However, the Government of India has also issued a directive to consider this research as authentic, avoiding eating litchi on an empty stomach and taking a balanced diet

 a recent study has revealed that many boys who look tip-top and smart from above are not that smart
 yah adhyayan uniwarsity of indiana bloomington ke shodhakartaaon ne kiya he
 Studies say that things that show your strength at a personal level can create a negative image after marriage or after joining a partner
 masalan, akele kaam karnaa yaa dusron se madad na maangana aadi
 The partner may feel lonely due to all these habits
 chuki ladkiyaan bhaavnaatmak str par jaldi jud jaati hai, aise main vah ummid karti hai ki unka saathi unase madad maangega yaa apane dil kii baat share karegaa
 If you too are in a new relationship and want to know whether or not to move forward in the relationship, then read these five tips carefully

 If your boyfriend jokingly tries to win or dominate you, you can consider it as an alarm
 ho saktaa he is rishte ko aage badhaane main aapako khwaabon kii duniya na mili
 Risk-takers Many boys perform risky tasks to appear adventurous and make an impression in front of a girl
 jaise rash driving, pahaad se jamp aadi
 But his habit shows that he can put himself in danger anytime
 aise logo ke saath rishta aage na badhaayaa jaae to hi behatar hoga
 Some boys start talking about sex right from the first meeting
 darasal, garlfriend banane kaa unka mukhya uddeshy hi sex hota he
 If your boyfriend repeatedly talks to you about sex or insists on making a physical relationship, then leave it immediately
 aise log loyal nahin hote
 If you do not take pleasure in sex after marriage, then you will get cheatoffice
 It is a good thing to give priority to Prioriticam, but if it is always the case then it is not right
 aapkaa bwoyfriend yaa jisase aapke rishte kii baat chal rahi he, vah hameshaa ghar, parivaar or apane rishte se zyada offis ko priurity detaa he to samaj len ki yah aapke liye sahi vyakti nahin he
 If you see these 6 things in it, immediately refuse the marriage
 
 
 apane faisle thopane vaalajab ham kisi rilenship main hote hai, to ek duusare se apane khushi or gam baantate hai
 But some people keep their things inside themselves

 Staying with him can weaken your confidence

 The defense budget of Pakistan is rarely discussed in Parliament
 iesai ke bajet kaa dastavej bhi pesh nahin kiya jaataa he
 It has been said in the news that accepting 60 million rupees is a 'rare example'
 khufia agency ke vishesh kaary ke bare main koi vivaran nahin diya gaya he

 Addressing a rally here, Rahul said that Modi gave land of size of Aurangabad in Maharashtra to Adani for just Rs 300 crore at the rate of Re 1 per square meter
 congress upaadhyaksh ne kaha, 'aaj adani ji kaa (gujarat main) raaj he
 Earlier, Vajpayee used to be a partnership of ji-advani
 or yah ek toffee model he
 ' unhone kaha ki pehle adwani ji hua karte the
 If you remove the letter 'V' from the English alphabet of Advani, it will become Adani
 rahul ne gujarat model ko ‘toffee model’ bataae jane kii vajah spasht karte hue kaha, 'gujarat main adani ji ko ek rupaya prati varg meter kii dar se jameen di gai
 For one rupee you also buy a toffee
 isi vajah se maine kaha ki yah gujarat model nahin he, balki vikaas kaa ‘toffee model’ he
 After Modi retaliated on such comments, Rahul reinvigorated the toffee model today
 rahul ne aarope lagaaya ki gujarat main 40 lakh log garibi rekha se neeche hai or kathin paristhitiyon main rah rahe hai, jabaki modi adani jaise kuch udyogpatiyon ko phayda pahunchaa rahe hai
 He alleged, "modi ji, leader of Toffee model, gave 45,000 acres of land to an industrialist
 yah aurangabad ke aakaar jitna he
 Do you know the amount given for this? 300 crores

 Crude oil prices in the international market have started to increase once again
 is saal june main brent crude ke nunatam str 44 dollar prati bairal se badhkar 63 dollar prati bairal tak pahunch chuki he
 The continuous rise in the prices of crude oil in the global market during the last one month has also increased the risk of uncontrolled inflation in Asian and especially India
 bazaar ke jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki antarrashtriya str par keemton main ijaphe kaa sidhaa asar bade ayatak deshon kii arthvyavastha par padataa he
 At the same time, the growth in the international market from June 2017 to November 2017 is more than 30 per cent, so obviously it has started to affect the economy

 ALSO READ: Good days of ending crude oil prices, don't let the daily pricing formula now
 Recently the research group Nomura had claimed that if the situation in the Gulf countries continues to deteriorate, then India should get the rising price of crude oil
 Countries like India may suffer the brunt
 gauratlab he ki bharat main kachche tel kii kul khapat kaa 80 fisadi khadi deshon se niryaat kiya jaataa he
 Hence, the direct impact of rising prices is going to have a bearing on retail inflation, growth rate and GDP in the country

 satya ke nae prayog ko thandak mil chuki thi
 Fugana became a tour
 sarkaar ne muaavje kaa elaan kar thand rakh lee
 And the cold spared death to the small-time Hamids
 hifaazat ke ferj kaa gaban ho chukaa tha
 By the way, it was not expected
 kisi ko nahin
 Because a few years ago when a young man came on a bicycle in this state, the public got down from the elephant and hugged him
 hamid bhi unheen main se ek tha
 Well, now it was not well, it was justice
 or insaaf detaa koun he, kanoon
 But the law asks for evidence
 ghar, izzat, bharosa sabakuch to jalakar khaak ho gaya tha hamid kaa
 Where did he bring that evidence? phir bhi vah gaya tha
 Near the law
 lekin kanoon ne kaha, uskaa chashma ittefacan tut gaya he
 Now nothing was visible to the law
 thand main marate bachche
 Disloyal women jaale ghar
 Broken Mosques
 kuch bhi nahin
 Hamid, who had received wounds from his neighbors, knew every man
 kyonki ye log to vahi log the, jo hamid se chimate, andey or shakkar lete the
 Less cash, more borrowings
 jo ab kabhi hamid nahin maang paaegaa
 In his farm, Hamid's children and grandchildren grew sugarcane or worked in a sugar mill
 shartiya koi bhi aadmi bahari nahin tha
 Because when the honor of the girls and women was being looted in Hamid's house, she was making a vow to spare herself by saying 'bhaijaan - Bhaijaan', but her plans were made of iron and were not ready to be soft
 
 ab hamid apana sabakuch ganvaa chukaa he
 In Delhi, someone said, Lashkar people have been seen talking to Hamid and there is evidence of his being a Pakistani
 yah sach bhi ho saktaa he, kyonki na to hamid ke paas aadhaar card he, na pan card
 He took his ration card, voter card, good governance and people with bicycles
 to hamid hindustani kaise ho saktaa he? Hamid had only his name left
 uskaa dimag kaam kar gaya
 Everyone knows him
 vah ab diarect pradhanmantri se baat karegaa
 But the problem was that if the Prime Minister does not speak anything, then how will he talk
 usne sochaa bhavi pradhanmantriyon se baat kii jaae
 Hamid first calls the 'P' prime minister, whose fingers have been strangled while voting, the answer comes from, i am not busy, but busy
 uske baad 'epa' pradhanmantri ko number milaataa he, lekin dikkat yah he ki unke phone par keval gujarat ke hi kol risive hote hai
 The number of left-wingers is often busy on every issue, as they hold seminars to protest against communalism
 deshbhar main
 Now Hamid calls the new leader of the common people with great hope towards the common man
 udhar se vishwasabhari aawaaj aati he


 yah aazaadee kii duusari ladaai he
 Register a complaint on our helpline
 samay aane par aam logon kii party sampark karegi
 Finally, he calls Netaji of the state, but he is also busy
 is sardi to puri siyaasi jamaat mujffarnagar taap rahi thi
 On these nights, socialism was wrapped up in the hot rajis from Mumbai and all the phones were on silent mode
 harkar hamid paas main jal rahe alaav main dhire se phone jhonk detaa he or vahiin bagal main sikud jaataa he, use jhapai aa jaati he
 Hamid dreams
 sapane main idhar kai maheenon se buudhe premchand aane lage the, lekin hamid unki baaten samaj nahin paa rahaa tha
 Because he too got old
 kai baar ek hi umr ke logon ke bich bhi thik samvaad nahin ho paata he
 And especially when both are elderly, it becomes difficult
 tippaniyan Then many educated people have started suspecting Premchand's words
 koi kahata he ki vah daliton kaa paksh thik se nahin rakh paae to koi kah rahaa he ki unhone brahmanon, thakuron ke atyaacharon kaa bachaav kiya
 Don't know what else so lagata he ki in baton kaa kuch asar hamid par bhi hone laga tha
 He used to read the newspaper
 khayr premchand hamid se itnaa hi kahana chaah rahe the ki yahaan se gharbaar bechakar kahin duusari jagah chale jaao
 Hamid asks slowly, where to go
 is baat kaa premchand ke paas koi jawaab nahin tha, so vah gaali-galouj par utar aate
 Hamid often grumbles, he cannot say what he wants to say, nor can anyone understand
 apane padosiyon se jakhm paane vaale hamid har bande ko pahachaanata tha
 Because these people were the same people who used to take tongs, eggs and sugar from Hamid
 nakad kam, udhari zyada
 Who will never ask for Hamid now
 inke khet main hi hamid ke bachche or pote ganna ugaate yaa chini mil main kaam karte
 No man was an outsider
 kyonki jab hamid ke ghar main bacchiyon, auraton kii izzat luti ja rahi thi to ve sabase naam lekar 


 bhaijan– bhaijan kahkar khud ko bakhshae jane kii minnaten kar rahi thim, lekin unke mansoobey lohe se bane the or mulaayam hone ko taiyaar hi nahin the
 Now Hamid has lost everything
 udhar dilli main kisi ne kaha, lashkar ke log hamid se baat karte dekhe gaye hai or uske pakistani hone ke saboot hai
 This can also be true, because neither Hamid has an Aadhaar card nor a PAN card
 uskaa rashancard, voter card sushasan or cycle vaale log apane saath le gaye
 So how can Hamid be Hindustani? hamid ke paas sirf uskaa naam bachaa tha
 His mind worked
 use to sab jaanate hai
 He will now speak to the direct Prime Minister
 lekin mushkil ye thi ki pradhanmantri to kuch bolte hi nahin, to phir vah baat kaise karegaa
 He thought to talk to future prime ministers
 hamid sabase pehle 'pi' pradhanmantri ko phone lagaataa he, jinako vot dete-dete uske haathon kii anguli gal gai he, vahaan se jawaab aata he, main rilactent nahin, par biji hum
 After that 'F' gets the number to the Prime Minister, but the problem is that only calls from Gujarat are received on his phone
 har mughde par baayen chalane waalon kaa number aksar biji rahata he, kyonki vah sampradayikta ke virodh main seminar karte rahete hai
 Nationwide
 ab hamid aam aadmi kii taraf badi ummid se aam logon ke nae netaa ko phone lagaataa he

 Defeated, Hamid gently slams his phone into the burning bonfire nearby and shrinks to the side, he blinks
 hamid sapana dekhtaa he
 Old Premchand had started coming here for many months in the dream, but Hamid could not understand his words

 hamid dhire se poochta, kahaan chale jaaen
 Premchand did not have any answer to this matter, so he would get abused
 hamid aksar badbadaata rahata he, vah kya kahana chahta he, na kah paata he or na koi samaj paata he

 You may try every recipe for your hair care but rarely you will find all those remedies sufficient
 har kisi kii khwaahish hoti he ki uske bal khabasurat hon, chamakdaar hon or ghaney-mulaayam hon
 We adopt a number of remedies for hair care and try to ensure that there is no deficiency in hair nutrition
 par duvidha yahi he ki baalo kii dekhbhaal kaa koi ekmaatr sutara to he nahin
 One person's hair is completely different from another's hair
 jo upaay kisi ek ke liye kargar ho wo jaruri nahin he ki duusare ke liye bhi ho hi
 The process from washing hair to grooming is different for everyone
 jis tarah sidhe bal waalon ko lagata he ki ghunghraale bal hona acha hausi tarah ghunghraale bal vaale street hair kii khwaahish karte hai
 However, there is no doubt that taking care of curly hair is a very difficult task
 aise baalo kii dekhbhaal ke liye ek ore jahaan bahut adhik dhairya kii jarurat hoti he vahiin agar curls bahut chote-chote hon to musiibat doguni ho jaati he
 If your hair is also curly, then these remedies can prove to be very effective and beneficial for you: 1
 har roj baalo ko dhoenghungharaale baalo ko saaf rakhane kaa iske sivaa doosraa koi vikalp hi nahin he
 It becomes even more important to keep such hair clean because the chances of getting tangled when it gets dirty increases
 aise main koshish karen ki baalo ke ganda hone se pehle hi aap unhen dho len
 2
 baalo main niyamit rup se tel lagaana he behad jarurizyadaatar maamalon main dekha gaya he kighungharaale bal dry hi hote hai
 In this case, it is very important to apply oil regularly
 aise baalo main tel lagane ke dauraan vishesh taur par dhyaan rakhane kii jarurat hoti he kyonki inamen tel aasaani se scalp tak pahunch nahin paata he or baalo ko paryaapt poshan bhi nahin mil paata he
 In this case, give oil massage to curly hair regularly
 3
 Avoid brushing: Repeated brushing in such hair is not right
 street baalo main to aap baar-baar kanghee kar sakate hai lekin ghunghraale baalo main baar-baar kanghee karnaa nuksaandeh ho saktaa he
 4
 hair pack lagaana na bhuulenhere pack lagane se bal khubasurat mulaayam or chamakdaar ban jate hai
 But if you want better results then nourishing the hair with a home mask will be beneficial
 isse baalo ko nuksaan bhi kam pahonchega or bal khubasurat bhi banenge
 5
 condishnar kaa istemalghungharaale baalo kii dekhbhaal ke liye bahut jaruri he ki aap shampoo karne ke baad condishnar kaa istemaal jarur karen
 This will make the curls less entangled and the results will be less broken
 6
 Solve when the hair is lightly wet
 While straight hair, it is advisable not to comb it when it is wet
 par ghunghraale baalo ke saath aisa nahin he
 If your hair is curly, comb them only when they are slightly wet
 isse bal kam ulajhenge or tootenge bhi kam
 7
 aasaan hair style apanaayenghungharaale bal apane aap main hi kisi style se kam nahin hote hai
 In such a situation, creating too much curved and difficult hair style can prove harmful to your hair

 He said that the Delhi Jal Board closed the huge drain of the British era for the drainage of rainy water near the BJP headquarters for security reasons and connected it to the small drain near the Kali temple
 chota naala pani ke dabaav ko nahin jhel paa rahaa he
 Due to this, the Minto Road gets flooded as soon as there is heavy rain
 unhone ye bhi bataaya ki bahut hi purana bada naala pahadganj main banaaya gaya tha
 Which used to pass in front of BJP headquarters on Deendayal Marg
 isamen aane vaala pani itio ke paas naale main girtaa tha, lekin ab us bade naale ko bijepi mukhyalay ke paas band kar diya gaya or kaali badi mandir ke paas chote naale se jod diya gaya

 ' jiya khan ne duubate filmi kariyar kii vajah se khudakushi nahin kii thi, balki sach to ye he ki ek adhuraa esemes jiya khan kii maut kii vajah bana
 According to the Mumbai Police investigation, Jiya was very happy till nine o'clock on Monday night
 usne teen-teen filmein sin kii thim lekin sava nau baje achaanak aisa kuch hua ki jiya ko gussa aa gaya or ye sab kuch ek adhure esemes kii vajah se hua
 'I WILL MEET BETWEEN 10 TO 1' This is the SMS which is incomplete and this incomplete SMS not only annoyed Jia but also created a misunderstanding between her and her lover Suraj Pancholi that killed Jia
 is esemes main likhaa he ki ai vil meet bitwin ten tu van, yani main tumse das se ek ke bich miloongi
 This SMS was sent by Suraj Pancholi's family friend Neelu to Suraj Pancholi on Monday
 ab ye esemes adhuraa kaise he yaa is ek esemes kii vajah se jiya ne khudakushi kyon kii ye samajhane ke liye jaruri he aap somvaar subah se lekar raat 11 baje tak yani jab jiya ne khudukshi kii tab tak kii puri kahani samaj len
 After spending most of the time together on Saturday and Sunday, Jiya's boyfriend Suraj Pancholi went to his work at 9
30 am on Monday
 jiya ghar par hi thi
 After this, at twelve o'clock in the afternoon, Jiya made the first SMS to Suraj
 jiya ne poocha ki why r u so cold with me? yani tumhaara bartaav mere saath itnaa thanda kyon he? suraj ne jawaab diya buisy
 After this, Jiah again smsed at 2
15 pm
 is baar usne likhaa, we had a nice weekend, why r u so cold wid me, suraj ne is esemes ke jawaab main bas itnaa likhaa wo gym main he
 After this, Suraj reached home at seven in the evening and he called Jia
 jiya ne tab suraj se kaha ki- jhe tumhen good news deni thi lekin tumne subah se mujhe awoid kiya hua he
 Suraj asked which good news? Jia then says that i have got three new pictures
 isapar suraj ne jiya ko mubaarakabaad dete hue doori bolaa
 After keeping the phone, Suraj gave one thousand rupees to his watchman and asked him to buy a bouquet and give it to Jiya at his house
 phir shaam ko suraj hotel novatail ke liye nikal gaya
 In Novatel, Suraj was supposed to meet two friends named Karan and Jhangiani
 suraj abhi hotel main hi tha ki tabhi raat nau baje jiya ne phir suraj ko phone kiya
 Jia thanked Suraj for the bouquet and asked where he is right now
 Sooraj told that he is in Hotel Novatel and is going to meet Neelu
 somvaar subah se jiya suraj se naaraaz jarur thi par baat ab bhi nahin bigadi thi
 The two were having equal conversation but as soon as Suraj tells Jia that now he is going to meet Neelu, after that the story turns
 iske baad jiya nilu ko phone karti he or phir nilu jo kuch use bataati he usase jiya bhadak jaati he
 After all, what did Neelu say to Jia and who is this Neelu? raat sava nau baje jiya nilu ko phone karti he or nilu se puuchhati he ki kya wo suraj se abhi milane vaali he
 On this Neelu tells that no she is not going to meet today
 itnaa hi sunate hi jiya bhadak jaati he
 She throws Suraj's bouquet out of the house and then angrily calls Suraj
 jiya is baat par ladati he ki suraj use jaan-boojh kar ewoid kar rahaa he
 She says that you are going to meet Neelu tomorrow and are telling me that you are going to meet today
 isapar suraj kahata he ki kuch galatfahami ho gai he
 He has to meet today
 iske baad suraj phone kaat kar nilu ko phone milaataa he or poochta he ki tumne to esemes kiya he ki tum aaj raat das se ek ke bich milogi
 On this Neelu says that this message was meant to meet at ten to one last night, not for today
 iske baj suraj nilu se kahata he ki wo plis jiya ko phone kar ye galatfahami dur kar de
 Neelu also explains by calling Jia but Jia's anger does not subside
 jiya ko shaq tha ki nilu kaa naam lekar suraj kisi or ladki se milane ja rahaa tha
 After this, there are repeated talks between Suraj and Jia but Jia does not agree
 aakhri kol raat 10 baj kar 53 minute par suraj ne kiya tha or jiya ne khudakushi raat 11 baj kar saat minute se 11 baj kar 22 minute ke bich kiya
 Actually 43 years old Neelkamal alias Neelu owns a jewelery shop on Charni Road
 nilu suraj kii maa kii jewelri banaati he
 Jia also made jewelery from Neelu many times
 isliye jiya bhi nilu ko jaanati thi
 a few days ago, Sooraj had repaired a chain of gold from Neelu and in the same connection, Suraj had to give 16 thousand rupees to Neelu
 yahi paise dene ke liye suraj ko nilu se milanaa tha or nilu ne isi liye suraj ko ye esemes kiya tha par esemes main vakt to likhaa tha lekin din nahin or bas isi ek adhure esemes kii vajah se jiya or suraj lard pade or anjaam shaq or gusse ke chalate jiya ne jaan de di
 According to police sources, it is true that Jia was not as happy about her film career as she was not getting work
 isaki vajah se wo tanaav main bhi rahati thi
 Not only this, about seven months ago, he tried suicide once
 tab usne sharaab kii tuuti bottle se haath kii nas kaat lee thi lekin police kaa kahana he ki jo ladki shaam ko teen filmein milane kii khushkhabari de rahi ho wo uske kuch ghante baad hi kariyar ko lekar khudakushi nahin kar sakati
 That is, it is about love and doubt
 wo shaq jo ek adhure esemes ne paidaa kiya

 Three months ago, it was difficult to find a single person in the government who was not calling GST a revolutionary reform
 sarkaar ke mantri or bhaajapa ke netaa yah maan rahe the ki bharat kaa adhikansh kaarobaar kar daayre se baahar he, kam se kam riyaayaton se or zyada se zyada sakhti vaale jiesti ke jariye use saaf suthra banaaya jayega
 This will reduce inflation, increase the income of the government, the growth rate will be able to grow at a faster pace
 ek july madhyaraatri main yahi jiesti desh ke itihaas sabase bada tex sudhaar tha
 After three months, GST gave up all its basic reformist provisions and stood on its head
 vajahon ko andaajana mushkil nahin he
 The vote base is more valuable than the tax base
 jameen khisakane se sarkaar itani dari ki jiesti main vah badlaav bhi kar diye gaye jinaki zarurat nahin thi
 The GST is now a full-blown capital, except for more tax, whatever major reforms were back now
 ise bhi padhein: notebandi nahin, 'jiesti main chook' se gir gai desh kii jidipikya he badlaavon kaa matlab?1
 In its 22nd meeting, the GST Council made two significant changes
 pehla, jiesti ke tahat compojishan skim main chhot kii seemaa ko badha diya
 Second 1
 5 karod rupee tak ke kaarobaar ko prati maah ritern daakhil karne kii jagah timahi aadhaar par ritern daakhil karne kii chhot de di
 2
 masik ritern jiesti kii buniyaad the
 Through this, the business bills had to be matched
 tex chori pakadi jaani thi
 Every business of the traders had to be compelled to do clean and bill and regular payment of input tax credit
 3
 After returning the old system of quarterly returns, about 90 per cent of the businesses covered by GST have been excluded from monthly monitoring
 ab mahaj 10 fisadi bade kaarobaariyon ko masik aadhaar par ritern daakhil karnaa hoga
 It is no surprise that these 10% of the large businesses that remain in the future will also be exempted from filing monthly returns as monthly returns will not be viable for them when their suppliers fill quarterly returns
 4
 The payment of regular input tax credits now appears difficult, which was necessary to reduce the cost of business
 5
 Other GST provisions, including e-waybill, have also been postponed for a long time, which were necessary to make the business transparent
 6
 Tax rates were changed at least once a year in the budget
 jiesti council ne teen maheene main teen baar utpaada or sevaaon par tex daron ko badla he
 And there may be further changes in electoral pressure
 tex daron main sithrata ke bajaay anischitata bad gai he
 7
 timahi ritern, compojishan skim, tex daron main uthalputhal se centre va rajyon ke rajasav kaa baaja or bighad saktaa he
 Who has the answer to these 5 questions? All the provisions which brought about the difficulties due to which GST was changed, were prepared exactly three months ago
 us samay sarkaar ko yah salaah di ja rahi thi ki in praavdhaanon par udyog or vyapaar se charchaa honi chahie or taiyaari kaa vakt milanaa chahie, jaisaa ki jiesti lagu karne vaale anya deshon main hua he
 1
 jiesti lagu karne ke liye 1 july kii taarikh kyon tay kii gai? jabaki kendra sarkaar ise puri taiyaari ke saath 15 sitambar tak lagu kar sakati thi
 This would have given more time for the GST software to be repaired and the businessmen preparing to move to the new tax regime
 teen maah main desh kii arthvyaravatha ko jo nuksaan hua he uskaa daayitv kis par he?ise bhi padhein: 80 par aansu mat bahaaen, abhi 100 rupee tak pahonchega petrol! yahaan samajhen ganit2
 Knowing that gstin was not tested, its initial functioning was not satisfactory, yet GSTN was imposed on 90 per cent of the businessmen whose digital literacy is very weak
 3
 The impact of impact on industry, trade by implementing GST was likely to affect the country's economy? 4
 kyon jiesti lagu karne se pehle kendra sarkaar ne exise or waite ke tahat tex dhache (rate riform) main sudhaar karne ko praathamikta nahin di?5
 The knowledge that now arises to bring petrol and diesel under the purview of GST was why it was rejected while making GST in just three months of June? GST was a major and significant improvement
 pehle jaldbaaji or baad main chunavi khauf main sarkaar ne ise ganvaa diya
 The three-month journey of GST is no longer an improvement, only the remaining tax which is higher than before on many services and products

 ) Posters of Narendra Modi have started appearing in the area where the Hurriyat dominates in Downtown Kashmir
 yani bijepi aise ilaakon tak pahunch gai he, jahaan vah jite yaa na jite, lekin usne apni maujuudagi yahaan bhi dikhaa di he
 The atmosphere of elections in the Khaniyar area of downtown was completely created, it is not strange, but the poster of Narendra Modi in the inner streets of this area is a new thing
 enditivi jab is ilaake ke lone mohalle main pahunchaa, to na sirf modi ke poster dikhaai die, balki kai gharon ke daravaajon par aise steekar bhi najar aae
 There we met Ashok Batt, who is a BJP candidate from Khaniyar area
 batt sahab ghar-ghar jaakar logon ke dukh-dard sun rahe hai
 He said that there is a lot of poverty here and unemployment is a big issue
 ilaake ke chakkar lagaate hue ashok batt ne modi kii lahar kaa hawala bhi hamen diya or kaha ki unki marfat modi ke poster yahaan tak chale aae hai
 However, when we talked to the common people, many of them did not know who Modi is
 ek mahila ne kaha ki modi dilli ke leader hai, to duusari ne kaha ki vah unke ghar thik karvaa denge
 In fact, there was a lot of destruction due to the recent floods in this area
 sthaneey logon kaa aarope he ki unhen abhi tak rajya sarkaar se koi madad nahin mili
 Ashok Batt alleges that Omar Abdullah's government did not distribute relief to the flood victims properly
 jab prashasan ko pataa chalaa ki modi ke poster yahaan lage hai, to inhen check bhi nahin die
 But Modi is aware of the new generation
 ek noujvaan ne kaha, jab hamane ensi ore pidipi ko mauka diya, to ek mauka bijepi ko bhi denge
 According to another youth, Modi's image is that of a strong leader, so we will vote for him
 jabaki unke saathi kii raay thi ki agar vah unke bhavishya thik kar denge, to modi ko mauka de sakate hai
 PDP is also engaged in the siege of Downtown
 usne haal hi main yahaan daftar kholaa he
 If voting is more, then PDP will benefit
 pidipi saansad tarik ahamed kaara ne kaha, aap khud dekh len, log badlaav chaahate hai
 Whereas according to PDP candidate Khurshid Alam, people want to see Mufti Saheb as Chief Minister
 vaise khaniyaar neshnal conference kaa garh mana jaataa he or pichley 9 main se 8 baar yahaan neshnal conference ne jeet hasil kii he
 Ali Mohammed Sagar, who was a minister in the Omar government, tells NDTV, "nobody wants the BJP here
 That party is only provoking people
" vah kehete hai ki yahaan ke log kabhi bijepi ke saath nahin jaaenge
 The last time Sagar got around 6,000 votes
 vaise is ilaake main hurriyat kii chalati he
 Most of the stones also move here when the situation worsens
 usne bycott kaa naaraa diya he or is naare ke bich bhi yahaan modi ke poster lage hue hai

 jab mujffarnagar dange kii aag main buree tarah jhulas rahaa tha, tab kendriya mantri ajit singh ne shanti bahaali ke liye apni ore se koi prayaas nahin kiya
 When the fire of hatred started spreading to his parliamentary constituency Baghpat, Ajit Singh came into action
 sampradayikta kii aag main mujffarnagar 28 agast se hi jhulas rahaa tha
 The Jat and Muslim communities were face-to-face in this struggle, but in western Uttar Pradesh, along with the Jat, the National Lok Dal President and Union Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh, who secured a handful of Muslim votes, kept silence
 isi kaa asar tha ki agast ko jab jaaton kii birdari kii panchayat kawal ke nikat nangla mandaud sthit choudhary charan singh inter college main hui, to bijepi-vihip ke netaaon ne manch par kabja jamaa liya
 The resentment against Rakesh Tikait of Bharatiya Kisan Union, considered a leader of the Jat community, was also evident and people even raised slogans against him
 jat samudaay par pakad rakhane vaale ajit singh kii chuppi ne samudaay ko kaaphi naaraaz kiya
 But now as the fire of communal riots spread to his parliamentary constituency Baghpat, Ajit Singh realized the responsibility of establishing harmony
 prashasan ne unhen jaise mujffarnagar jane se roka, usee tarah bagpat jane se bhi roak diya
 The RLD supremo announced that they would go from village to village and try to restore peace by talking to the people and try to bring back those who had fled from fear of violence
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki agar jat samudaay par pakad rakhane vaale ajit singh mujffarnagar ke kawal gaanv main bhadkee hinsa ke fouran baad is tarah kii muhim shuru karte, to kya sampradayakita kii aag bagpat tak pahunchati? shaayad aisa nahin hota, lekin jat or muslim vot bank ke dwandv main fanse ajit ne tab chuppi saadh lee
 If he had gone to Muzaffarnagar at that time, the administration would not have stopped him like this
 ab ajit singh samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar par aarope laga rahe hai or rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagane kii maang kar rahe hai
 Sometimes taking shortcuts can be so overwhelming that you will get an idea by reading this news
 darasal, china main ek mahila ne tay kiya ki wo shortkat lekar apane ghar jaaegi, lekin baad main use ehsaas hua ki uski raah itani aasaan nahin he
 a woman living in Anhui province of China tried to get out of the way between the two walls of the cemetery at 10 o'clock to go home
 lekin jaise-jaise vah aage badhati gai rasta sankara hota gaya
 After a long time she realized that she was trapped badly and there was no use to return as she had come very far
 vah do deevaaron main funs gai thi or uske paas vahaan se guzar rahe rahgeeron or aasapaas rahane vaale logon se madad kii guhaar lagane ke alaava koi chaara nahin tha
 But people felt that there is a ghost in the middle of the wall and no one came forward to help him
 mahila ne puri raat vahiin guzari or agali subah paanch baje kisi rahgeer ko ehsaas hua ki chillane kii aawaaj kabr se nahin aa rahi or usne alarm baja diya
 After this, the rescue team reached there and they broke the wall and saved the woman

 yah saaf-saaf raashtra virdohi he
 "delhi Police Commissioner Bhimsen Bassi said these words with seriousness while talking to the TV channel on 23 February
 unhone spasht kiya, “rajdroh kanoon kaa dayera badhaane kii sakht jarurat he
 It needs to be redesigned, eliminating all the scope of ambiguity, so that people do not have any doubt what anti-national work is
 ”koun yaa kya raashtra virdohi he? yah lakh take kaa sawaal is samay desh kii sabase naatakeey kanoonee bahes ke centre main aa gaya he-dilli ke jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay (jeenyu) ke kuch chaatro ne 2001 main sansad par hue hamale ke aaropee afjal guru kii vivaadaaspad faansee kii saalagirah ke maukey par 9 farvari ko kathith taur par bharat-virdohi naare lagaae
 On 13 February, Kanhaiya Kumar, president of JNU Students' Union, was arrested on charges of treason
 23 farvari ko rajdroh ke aaropee do anya chaatro umr khalid or anirbaan bhattacharya ne madhyaraatri main dilli police ke saamne “aatmasamarpan” kar diya
 He denied that he had done anything wrong and also said, "these people are telling us about patriotism
" ”desh akhabaaron ke pannon or tivi channelon kii bite main duba he, yah jaanane-samajhane ke liye ki 156 saal puraani bhartiya dand samhita (ipisi) 1860 kii vah choti-si dhara 124-e aakhir he kya, jo paribhaashit karti he ki abhartiya koun yaa kya he
 Accordingly, "any person who utters or seeks to incite hatred or contempt by words, spoken or written, or by signs, or by visual representations, or in other ways, or with respect to the lawful government in India Tries to provoke or provoke, he will be punished
 ” rajdroh ko “rajya ke khilaaf aparaadh” mana jaataa he or yah kisi ko jindagi bhar salaakhon ke peeche rahane ke liye abhishpt kar saktaa he
 The Slavery Era "I think the time has come when we take appropriate measures and formulate a policy that effectively curbs sedition-related disturbances
" ” yah agast 1909 kii baat he
 The Viceroy of India, Lord Minto, was resting in his summer capital Shimla and meditating on "steps to be taken to crush treason"
 lekhaagaar main darj bharat sarkaar ke abhilekh, videsh vibhaag, kram sankhya 178 ke mutabik, unhone 25 riyasaton ko chitthiyaan bhejin or “ek saajha khatre ke khilaaf aapasi sahyog kii” maang kii
 And there was this common danger - "disgruntled people" who dare to criticize the British rule in India
 tab se 100 se zyada saal biit chuke hai, magar vah “rajdroh” lafj aaj bhi nirvaachit loktantr kii phijaaon main gunj rahaa he, us loktantr main jahaan naagarik hi jan nitiyon or kanoonon ko vaidhata pradaan karte hai
 This was also a cure for the age-old common law of the British, introduced by the British in 1879

 R
 madhav menon kehete hai, “aupniveshik shaasha hone ke naate unhen sarkaar ke prati aupniveshik logon kii naaraazgi ko “aparaadh qaraar dene” kii jarurat mahasoos hui
 But it continues to be absurd in independent India
 ” ve spasht karte hai, nirvaachit loktantr main har naagarik ko sarkaar ko naamanzoor kar dene or hinsa kaa sahaara liye bagaiyr agle chunaav main use hataane kii koshish karne kaa adhikaar he
 The term treason goes against the Preamble of the Indian Constitution and the right to freedom of speech and expression embodied in Article 19 (1) (a)
 kanoon sammat adhikaron par pratibandhduniya bhar ke zyaadaatar aadhunik sanvaidhanik loktantric deshon main rajdroh ko yaa to puri tarah se khatm kar diya gaya he yaa iske praavdhaan kaa istemaal band ho gaya he
 The sedition law in Britain was repealed in 2009 because it did not reflect the values of constitutional democracy
 purv upnivesh newjiland ne or bhi pehle 2007 main is kanoon se nijaat paa lee kyonki yah loktantric mulyon ko thes pahunchaa rahaa tha or vipaksh ko khamosh karne kaa aujaar ban gaya tha
 The courts in the US have consistently criticized the "ban on law-related rights" from the sedition law on freedom of expression and provided broad protection to political speeches
 vahaan rajdroh ko rokane main naakaami bhi dandaneey he
 In Australia, this law is enshrined in the crime codes of many states
 lekin 1985 se hi iske daayre ko chota kar diya gaya he or sajaa ko kaid se ghataakar jurmaane par laayaa gaya he
 However, successive governments in India have been using it fearlessly due to the ambiguity of the language of this law, the heavy legal history and conflicts over judicial interpretations
 aazaadee se pehle ke mukademon main iske haq main “british hukumat ko kamjor karne” kii daleel di jaati thi
 The same argument was made in the 1897, 1908 and 1915 sedition cases against freedom fighter Bal Gangadhar Tilak
 vahiin aaazaad hindustan main nyaaypalika ne logon ko hinsa ke liye uksaane ke maamalon main rajdroh ke mukademe thok die
 Over the years, the basis for treason charges has increased - "crossing the limits of legitimate criticism"
 "to publish habitually seditious material;" "making a mockery of the constitution;" "crime against the state;" Or spreading "hatred", "contempt" and "dissatisfaction"
 phir bhi nyaaypalika deshadroh ke maamalon main bhi aam taur par logon ko doshamukt karti rahi he
 In 1942 (in Niharendu Dutt Majumdar vs Raja Samrat case) the Calcutta High Court quashed the case in which the appellant was arrested because of his speech that the government had stopped communal disturbances during the Dhaka riots
 Did not take steps
 adaalat ne faisle main kaha-“ise rajdroh kii karrwai bataanaa ise bahut zyada izzat bakhshana he
 "in 1962, the Supreme Court said (in Kedar Nath Singh v
 State of Bihar)," a citizen has the right to write whatever he wants by criticizing or commenting on the government or its measures, as long as he Does not incite people to violence
 ” 1995 main (balavant singh tathaa anya banaam punjab rajya ke mukademe main) supreme court ne un do logon ko sajaa dene se inkaar kar diya tha, jinhone indira gandhi kii hatya ke din ek bheed bhare cinema haul main “khalistaan jindabad” ke naare lagaae the

 In 2003, the then Congress government of Rajasthan filed a sedition case against VHP leader Pravin Togadia for violating its ban on tridents

 The National Commission for Women reacted harshly to the minister's remarks

 Lalita Kumaramangalam said that such a statement from the Home Minister is unacceptable and regrettable
 unhone kaha, 'main is mantri se sawaal karnaa chaahati hum ki kya bhartiya purush itane gire hue or kamjor hai ki kisi samaaroh ke din mahilaon ko pashchimi kapadon main dekhakar bekaabu ho jate hai

 She will be seen on screen with her father Anil Kapoor for the first time
 film main rajkumaar raav or juhi chawla bhi ahm bhoomika main hai
 The film will be released on 1 February
 movie kaa nirdesan style chopra ne kiya he
 Vidhu Vinod Chopra is producing the film
 somvaar kofilska doosraa gaanaa ''gud naal ishk meetha" relies kiya gaya
 The song became popular on social media as soon as it was released
 is gane ko anil or sonam kapur par filmaaya gaya he
 Anil Kapoor's energy in the song is tremendous
 gane ko navaraj hans or harshadeep cor ne gaaya he
 The lyrics of this song are from Gurpreet Saini
 kitaab: a romance vid keos (fiction)lekhak: nishanth kushikprakashak: roopa publikeshnakimat: 140 rupee (paperbaque)nishanth kowshik kii kahani 'a romance vid keos' keos trylogy kii pehali kahani he
 Like every story, it also has a protagonist
 logon kii bheed main uskaa akelaapan he
 There is a struggle with uncertainties and a suffocation as to what will happen next
 'jindagi koi supermarket nahin he, jahaan sinboard lage hon or aapako raah dikhaaen
 'this is the conclusion you draw from the thrill of life of Nakul Kapoor
 nakul umr ke tisare dashak ke darmiyaan he
 He is an executive in a Mumbai-based IT company 'bytesphere'
 uski tarah company main or bhi kai hajaar log kaam karte hai
 Everyone is in the world to make a good impression on their boss so that they get bonus points or their appraisal is the best
 haalanki yah sab tab he jab har koi lambey arase se apane kaam se asantusht he
 Especially because his boss, Chirayu 'chipo' Chaudhary, is one of those who describes the work of others as his own and never appreciates your hard work
 yakeenan nakul bhi khud ko safalataa kii is daud kaa hissaa maanata he
 Vishal and Lekha have two partners in Bytesphere, who support her in times of dilemma
 in sab ke bich kavya he
 Kavya, his love
 vah nakul ko gupachup dhang se hi sahi, lekin prerit karti he ki vah gym jaae or apana vajan kam kare
 She also wants Nakula to bring her expensive and branded gifts
 kavya nakul se kahati he ki vah nai or behatar naukari dhunde taaki unka bhavishya surakshit ho
 When he comes to the office, his friends at Bitesphere give him courage and solace, but they themselves are withering about their future
 yah kahani aapako apni se lag sakati he
 This author believes in Nishant Kaushik
 unka maananaa he ki kitaab ke pannon main har kisi ko apni kahani dikhegi, phir chaahe vah iti company main ho yaa nahin ho
 The circumstances in which Nakula is, one would think of himself as equally dissatisfied
 khayr, ham kahani main aage badhate hai or pate hai ki nakul naukari badal paane main asafal sabit hota he
 He gets the privilege of going abroad from office work, but is unfortunately called back
 kavya use chhod detii he or yah uske ghaav par namak chhidakane kaa kaam karata he
 The story moves forward, but does Nakula's life come back on the right track? Does someone or unknown person support him in his problems? Does he really get any signboard in his life that knows the right path? Or does his life just go on and on and on and on? ”romance with Chaos is the story of Nakula's thrill
 yah vah yatra he jo jivan kii sabase jaruri shiksha se rubaru karwaati he
 There is a pace in the story and it does not let you get tired
 nakul ke jivan ke anubhav or pareshaaniyon se jujhane kii daastaan aapako romanchit karti he
 a conversation with Nakula's Punjabi mother, who is upset about her marriage or knowing the thoughts of her roommate, brings a pleasant feeling to 'bitesphere' amidst the pressures and troubles of work
 haalanki kai staron par kahani thodi dhimi hoti he, lekin kowshik apni lekhan kala se pathak ko phir se romanchit kar dete hai
 The story has many twists and is fun
 kahani kehane kaa andaaj saadhaaran he, jisase ise samajhane main aasaani hoti he
 'romance with Chaos' confronts the truth of life, where friends in office get duped in order to move forward
 ansulajhe paristhitiyon ko sulajhane kii yah daastaan aapako pasand aegi or ise kam se kam ek baar padhanaa hitkaari rahegaa

 raav ne kaha ki in patron ke aadan pradaan ke bich videsh mantralay ne shaayad ek patr likhaa, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki america anderson ke pratyrpan ke liye manjuuri nahin de rahaa he
 But i can say that the CBI has never been pressurized by the Ministry of External Affairs to crack this case
 laal ke daavon ke sambandh main raav ne kaha ki unase poochna (laal se) prashn nahin he balki sibiai se poochna asal mudda he
 The former CBI chief said that he had only said that a letter had come but that letter would have come through me
 lekin mujhe nahin pataa ki us patr main kya tha
 We have not yet seen that letter even in the media
 raav ne kaha ki sibiai or videsh mantralay ke bich kai baar patron kaa aadan pradaan hua
 He said that the letter may be in reference to the non-clearance of extradition from the US government
 lekin ek cheez spasht he ki vah (america) use bharat ko pratyrpit karne ko taiyaar nahin the
 Rao insisted that the Government of India, the CBI and the Ministry of External Affairs had never and never dropped the extradition case for Anderson
 unhone kaha ki hamane iske liye hameshaa prayaas kiya
 But each of our attempts was like hitting the wall

 The body of Monu alias Mohanlal was found on Wednesday night in Baswa, Rajasthan's Dausa district

 It is said that Mohan Lal alias Monu went to the fair in Neemla with his family

 When Monu did not come long enough, the family started searching for him

 On seeing the news of a dead body being recovered from the railway track in the morning, the family members went and saw it

 The wounds of the family members who were engulfed in mourning due to the death of Monu were not even old enough that the younger brother Sachin came out of the house in the morning and did not return

 Today, the whole country is celebrating the 20th anniversary of Kargil Vijay Diwas
 is maukey par maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne soobe ke 500 sthanon par muft main 'uri: da sargical strike' film dikhaane kaa elaan kiya he
 Political analysts are calling this decision of Devendra Fadnavis on Kargil Vijay Day a political bet
 maharashtra main isi saal vidhansabha chunaav hone vaale hai
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will try to cash in on the surgical strike in the assembly elections like the Lok Sabha elections
 darasal, maharashtra main bijepi or shivasena ke rishton main sabakuch behatar nahin chal rahaa he
 Shiv Sena has laid claim to the post of Chief Minister
 is bich bijepi ne siyaasi bisaat bichhaani shuru kar di he
 Like the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP will also carry out surgical strikes and airstrikes made to teach Pakistan a lesson with its work among the people in the Maharashtra Assembly elections
 isaki shuruyaat kargil vijay diwas par uri film ko dikhaane se ho rahi he
 Surgical strike on Kargil Vijay Day In 1999, Pakistan waged war during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government
 26 july 1999 ko bharat ne kargil yuddh main vijay hasil kii thi
 In the Kargil War, more than 500 brave soldiers of the Indian Army laid down their lives
 kargil yuddh par bollywood main 'border' film bhi bani thi
 On the 20th anniversary of Kargil Vijay Diwas, the Maharashtra government has decided to release the film 'uri: The Surgical Strike'
 is film main bhartiya sena ne pakistan main pal rahe aatankiyon se 2016 main hue uri hamale kaa badla liya tha
 'how is the Josh' will resonate in the assembly elections, according to political analysts, the Modi strike was the highest for what Bollywood brought to the screen on the surgical strike against Pakistan
 2019 ke chunaavon 'haau ij da josh' kaa naaraa gunja or bijepi 2014 kii tulana main 2019 main adhik siton par jeetne main kaamyaab hui
 The Modi government considers the surgical strike a major achievement of its tenure
 yahi kaaran he ki maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav se pehle ek baar phir apane us saahas bhare faisle ko janata ke bich rakh rahi he
 Pulling the Chief Minister's chair The main motive of showing the film is also the pull behind the curtain between BJP and Shiv Sena regarding the Chief Minister's chair
 kuch din pehle shivasena ne apane mukhpatr 'saamana' main mukhyamantri pad par daawa thokate hue likhaa tha ki maharashtra kaa aglaa siem to unka hi hoga
 The Shiv Sena had said, 'their leaders say in front of BJP workers,' Don't worry, the Chief Minister will be ours
 ' yahaan ham bhi kehete hai, 'aglaa mukhyamantri shivasena kaa hi hoga
 'fadnavis had said, i will return only
 After Shiv Sena's statement, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said,' i am not only BJP but also Chief Minister of Shiv Sena, RPI, Rashtriya Samaj Paksha
 janata yah nirnay karegi ki koun aglaa mukhyamantri hoga
 You do not need to worry
 hamaara kaam hi hamaare liye bolegaa
 i have already said that i will return
 kuch log mukhyamantri pad kaa mudda uthaa rahe hai
 Do not fall in their trap
 donon partiyon main aise kai log hai jo anaavashyak bolte rahete hai
 'aditya Thackeray launches' Jan Ashirvad' Yatra Amid pulling the chief minister's post, Shiv Sena youth unit chief Aditya Thackeray started the 'jan Ashirvad' Yatra
 aditya thakare ne 'nayaa maharashtra' banane kaa aahvaan kiya
 On this occasion, Aditya Thackeray had said that this yatra is not a campaign to seek votes in view of the upcoming elections, but a 'pilgrimage' for him
 jabaki sanjay raut ne aditya thakare kii tarif karte hue kaha tha ki mukhyamantri kaa pad agar shivasena ko mila to thakare is pad par kabiz honge
 Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis is going to start a state visit next month, which will pass through almost every assembly constituency, in the wake of the assembly elections after Aditya Thackeray
 is yatra kaa makasad kaaryakartaaon main garmi bharna to he hi, saath hi unke netritv main chunaav ladane kaa ek tarah se aupchaarik elaan bhi hoga
 It is believed that the party will want to contest the state assembly elections on its 'brand'
 uske 'brand' main sargical strike bhi he, jise 'uri: da sargical strike' ke jariye bhunaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he

 vainglorious 📷 - @therawlab__a post shared byarjun Kapoor(@arjunkapoor) onoct 16, 2018 at 9:46am PDT Taking lessons from the Delhi government's decision to cut electricity rates by 50 per cent, All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary and MP Sanjay Nirupam on Wednesday demanded that the Maharashtra government consume less than 500 units of electricity in the city every month
 To reduce electricity rates
 mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan ko likhe gaye patr main mumbai (uttar) se loksabhaa saansad nirupam ne kaha ki un logon ke liye bijli kii daron main acchhee-khaasi kami kii jaani chahie jo har maheene 500 unit se kam kii khapat karte hon
 "it is not just Anna Hazare's right to go on a hunger strike," he told reporters
 ham bhi aisa kar sakate hai
 Therefore, i have written a letter to the Chief Minister asking for immediate reduction in electricity rates for domestic consumers
 yadi aisa nahin hua to hamaare paas virodh pradarshan ke sivaay or koi vikalp nahin rah jayega
 This may cause embarrassment to our own government
 ’’ Nirupam said that the decision to reduce electricity rates will increase the prestige of the Congress in the public eye and justice will be done to the entire middle class and the slum population
 yah puche jane par ki kya aapaki maang ko doharaa ravaiya nahin mana jayega kyonki congress aksar aam aadmi party (aap) ke faisle ko ‘‘lokapriyatawadi’’ qaraar detii he, is par nirupam ne kaha, ‘‘yadi koi acha faisla der se bhi liya jaae jo uskaa hameshaa swaagat hota he
 '' nirupam ne kaha, ‘‘apane patr main maine dilli sarkaar ke faisle kaa hawala diya he
 There is no harm in taking inspiration from good decisions of other governments
 ’’ yah puche jane par ki kya vah ‘aap’ main shaamil hone ke bare main soch rahe hai, is par He said, "I am a Congress MP and will remain in the party
" main sirf yah sunishchit karnaa chaah rahaa hum ki uski pratishtha kam na ho

 In second place, the US President addresses but Trump arrives late for a general discussion and the current session of the General Assembly called for President Maria Fernanda Espinosa to address Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno
 paricharchaa mensadasy rashtraka sambodhan hota he or iske baad jarurat padane par jawaab diya jaataa he

 US President Donald Trump has mimicked PM Modi's style of speaking
 trump ne ye nakal tab kii jab ve afghanistan par america kii niti kaa zikr kar rahe the
 Trump told that Modi once told him- 'america has helped Afghanistan on very low returns, no such country does
 ' ye baat kehete vakt trump ne modi ke angreji bolne ke andaaj kii nakal bhi kii
 Trump also mimicked the Indian leader's accent, according to the Washington Post's report, earlier this month when Trump had commented on Haiti and African nations, while also mimicking the Indian leader's accent
 landan ke meyar sadik khan ne kaha aatankiyon kii bhashaa main baat karte hai donald trampabata den, trump or modi kii dosti kii charchaa kai mauko par hoti rahi he
 The effect of this is that recently the enemy administration of Pakistan was criticized by the Trump administration
 america raashtrapati ne kiye kai dawetrump ne daawa kiya ki bhartiya netaa (modi) kii yah tippanee saboot he ki america ko duniya kis najar se dekhati he
 America has done a lot of work in Afghanistan and it is understood by the world
 forbs main lekh, agar safalataa chaahate hai trump to modi ko maane apana role modelapahale bhi kii he nakdagar yah sach he ki trump ne bhartiya pradhanmantri kii nakal kii he, to yah pehali baar nahin hoga
 Earlier in the spring of 2016, during the election campaign, Trump had made a similar sound mocking the call center representative in India
 ‘sahitya aaj tak’ ke ‘kalam aaazaad he teri’ satr main charchit lekhikaon ne hissaa liya
 During this, he spoke on the issue of freedom from pen to women
 lekhan se lokapriyata kii nai bulandiyon ko chune or kai bandhanon ko todane vaali jin mahila lekhikaon ne is satr main shirkat kii, unamem indira daangi, nilimaa chouhan or sharmila bohara jalaan shaamil raheen
 Indira Dangi said- Those who feel, they write, Indira Dangi, who is already known in the literary world with her novel 'raptile Rajpath', is a well-known name of Hindi youth writing
 inhone apni rachanaaon main aurat ke manamizaaj ko aise ubhaara ki vah sharir se judi bahes se upar uthakar khud main aisa sawaal ban gai, jinke jawaab ab bhi talaashe ja rahe hai
 During the program, when Indira Dangi was asked whether the freedom of a pen means bold and unbridled writing
 On this, he said that the difference between sympathy and self-realization is the same here
 pehle ke lekhan or aaj ke lekhan kaa dhang alag he
 Today we write what we feel and no one can stop it, because the pen is in our hands
 premuchandra kii nayika main peedit mahilaon kii baat likhi gai or aaj bhimhilaonki pidaa ko hi likhaa jaataa he
 We do not just write female discourse
 ham maanviyata kii baat likhte hai
 Writes the story of women who are burnt, cut, killed, sent along with someone like sheep and goats, raped and tortured
 main ek lekhak hum, na stri hum or na hi purush huh nilimaa chauhananilimaa ne baagi prem-vivaahon kii kahaniyaan jutain or ashok kumaar pandeya ke saath uskaa sankalan nikaala
 But she got fame with 'fallible wives' notes'
 nilimaa chouhan vaise to apane lekhan se mardon kii bakhiya bhi udhedti hai, par kattar feministon kii tarah purush virdohi nahin hai
 She believes in the beauty of 'live and live do' and seeks balance in both life and writing
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha, ‘ham sangharsh kii kahaniyaan likhte hai
 i am a writer, i am neither a woman nor a man
 swatantra hona hi kalam kaa mularoop he
 It should not be in mortgage
 vaise ek lekhak hona hi adarsh sthiti he
 There are many Hindustan in one country: Sharmila Bohra Jalan 'shaadi Se Peshtar', 'budha Chand', 'raag-virag and other stories' are the famous books of Sharmila Bohra Jalan
 yah nae daur kii aisi lekhika hai, jo kissagoi kii shakl main apni baat kahati hai
 For example, even if the matter is new, the way of telling and telling is their own
 jab unase poocha gaya ki kya ekalekhika kitababechney or shoharat hasil karne ke liye hi stri kii baat likhti he, to unhone kaha, ‘aisa nahin he
 Woman is a state of mind
 ek aadmi bhi stri kii bhaavana ko behatar dhang se likh saktaa he
 i am a writer and a writer is a writer
 ek lekhak ko stri yaa purush kii simaaon main baandhne kii koshish nahin kerani chahie
 The pen is raised in opposition and resistance
 lekhan ke dauraan lekhak ko tamaam dwand se guzarana padataa he
 He said that if a writer writes boldly, why does the society become restless? The finger of the character of such writers is raised
 yah kaha jane lagata he ki isamen wo mahilaayein nahin hai, jo gramin kshetra se aati hai
 They are not women who are really suffering
 isamen sharaab pine vaali mahilaon kii baat likhi gai he
 After all, why the society is unable to accept the writings of such women? Whatever it is, but society has to accept it

 sansad main rafel saude par raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne congress ke ek-ek sawaal kaa jawaab diya
 Attacking the Congress, Sitharaman said a deadlock was created over the Rafale deal
 congress ne sena kii jarurat ko nahin samajha or desh kii suraksha se samjhauta kiya
 He said that we are in danger from our neighbors and we have to keep peace in the area
 unhone kaha ki iske liye apni sena ko majbootee dene kii bhi jarurat he taaki hamaari simaaen surakshit ho saken
 He also said that we should learn from our neighbors
 china pakistan apni kshamta badhaa rahe hai or hathiyaar kharid rahe hai
 He questioned the Congress and asked why the Congress could not reach the Rafale deal till 2014
 raksha mantri ke jawaab ke dauraan vipaksh hangaamaa karata rahaa
 Then he surrounded the Congress and asked why the Rafale aircraft could not be acquired, but today the Congress is making a ruckus after the Rafale deal is done
 saath hi sitaraman ne kaha, 'congress mere sawaalon kaa jawaab de
 Tell what happened and for whom the Rafale deal did not happen? Also tell me why did it play with the security of the country? 'in response to AA, during the speech of Sitharaman's RV and q Sitharaman, the Congress asked the question that the deal was made for AA (anil Ambani)? To this, he replied to the Congress that if you talk about AA, then the name of one RV (robert Vadra) and q (quattrocchi) in every aa's answer
 saath hi unhone kaha ki aarvi piem nahin desh ke damaad hai
 We completed the dealership in 14 months, the minister said that the Congress should dare to hear the truth
 raksha saude kii prakriya 10 saal tak nahin chalati, hamane 14 maheene main deal kii prakriya puri kii
 During the upa's time, the agreement process could not be completed for 10 years whereas we have shown it in 3 months
 unhone kaha ki jo apane do kaarykaal main sauda puraa nahin kar paae wo hamase jawaab maang rahe hai
 The Defense Minister said that Rafale aircraft will arrive in India 15 months ahead of schedule
 yahi nahin unhone kaha ki sabhi 36 vimaan tay samay se 5 maheene pehle hi bharat aa jaaenge
 Rafale will be delivered first in September 2019

 She did not want Rafael to come to India

 standing cameti ne HAL kii kshamta par sawaal uthaae the
 HAL did not produce aircraft on time, even after that no steps were taken to improve HAL
 saath hi unhone kaha ki congress 136 nahin sirf 18 vimaan kharidne vaali thi
 We increased the number of aircraft from 18 to 36
 rafel saude par congress desh ko gumraah kar rahi he
 He also asked why HAL was not given the Augusta deal

 Explain that the entire Congress party, including Congress President Rahul Gandhi, had accused the BJP of not answering their questions regarding the Rafale case
 congress ne kaha tha ki is mudde par piem khamosh hai, raksha mantri khamosh hai koi jawaab nahin de rahaa
 Those responsible for coming to government will be punished: Before this, Congress President Rahul Gandhi once again targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Rafale case and said that if his party is formed in 2019, there will be a criminal investigation in this case and those responsible Will be punished
 gandhi ne yah bhi kaha ki vitt mantri arun jetali ko un par hamale karne kii bajaay rafel maamle par desh jo sawaal puch rahaa he unka jawaab dena chahie
 He said in the Parliament House complex, 'look at the youth, the farmers

 The Prime Minister was not in Parliament at the time of discussion
 vah rafel par charchaa se bhaag gaye
 The Congress President said, 'arun Jaitley gave a long speech, abused me
 lekin jo sawaal hai unako jawaab nahin diya
 "he questioned," the price of the aircraft was increased from Rs 526 crore to Rs 1600 crore
 yah kisne badhaayaa? kya vayusena ne badhaayaa yaa pradhanmantri ne badhaayaa?’ gandhi ne kaha, ‘kya vayusena ne 126 vimaan maange the yaa 36 vimaan maange the? anil ambani ko anubandh kisne dilvaaya? france ke purv raashtrapati francwa oland ne kaha ki modi ji ke kehane par anil ambani ko anubandh diya? kya nae saude ko lekar raksha mantralay ke adhikariyon ko aapatti thi?’unhone kaha, ‘aashaa he ki raksha mantri iskaa jawaab dengi

 He once again reiterated the demand that the matter should be investigated by the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC)
 isse pehle gandhi ne twit kar kaha, ‘apane mitra anil ambani ko rafel kaa anubandh dekar pradhanmantri ne bhrashtachar ke alaava rashtriya suraksha ko kamjor karne kaa kaam kiya

 In the Aarushi Talwar murder case, CBI has filed two conflicting reports based on the same evidence
 sanyukt nideshak arun kumaar ke netritv main pehali sibiai jaanch june 2008 or april 2009 ke bich hui
 In May 2009, Arun Kumar submitted his investigation to a team headed by Deputy Director Neelabh Kishore
 arun kumaar kii team ne jahaan aarushi ke pita rajesh talwaar ko bari kar diya or teen naukaron par andeh jaahir kiya, vahiin duusari team ne naukaron ko bari karte hue talwaar kii ore ungali uthaai
 Both conflicting conclusions of CBI teams cannot be true
 ekmaatr sandigdh talwaar kehete hai ki maamle ko dobaaraa kholaa jaae
 So who murdered Aarushi on May 16, 2008? According to Arun Kumar's team, on the night of the murder, the three domestic servants - Krishna, Rajkumar and Vijay Mandal were talking about Aarushi drinking alcohol in Hemraj's room, they went to Aarushi's room when drunk, her mouth Stopped and hit her head with some blunt thing
 arun kumaar ke mutabik, ''unhone aarushi ke saath jabaran sambandh banane kii bhi koshish kii
 "this led to a quarrel among them
 is dar se ki shor sunakar uske mata-pita na jaag jaaen, ve chat par gaye, jahaan rajkumaar or krishna kaa hemraj se jhagada hua or unhone hemraj kii hatya kar di
 Krishna and Rajkumar then return to Aarushi's room and shave her neck
 arun kii team ne naukaron kaa narko test karaayaa lekin talwaar dampati ko jhooth pakadaney vaali mashin se parakhane ke baad chhod diya
 The investigation of Kishore gives the exact opposite of the events of the night of the murder on the day of the murder
 uske mutabik, aarushi kii hatya ke vakt teenon naukar talwaar dampati ke ghar par nahin the
 There was only a couple in the house
 is jaanch kaa daawa he ki aarushi kii hatya ke baad uske nijee angon ko saaf kar diya gaya, khun ke dhabbon or chat kii ore jane vaali sidhiyon par kharonche jane ke nishaan ko bhi saaf kar diya gaya
 They believe that Hemraj was wrapped in a bedsheet and taken to the roof
 dining teble par sk whisky kii bottle, jis par marane vaale donon vyaktiyon ke khun ke nishaan the, kii maujuudagi ishaara karti he ki hatyare ne aparaadh ke baad ho saktaa he, sharaab pi ho
 Aarushi's mobile was missing, which was found in September 2009, 14 months after the murder, her memory was completely erased
 arun kumaar kii team ke ulat kishor ne talwaar dampati kaa narko test karaayaa
 The closure report states, "there is no evidence against the servants, except the Narco test, which cannot be believed
" '' isi report main agency kahati he ki talwaar dampati par kiye vaigyanik teston se ''spasht pataa nahin chalata ki aparaadh main unka haath he
 "CBI results: Servant innocent, sword suspect
" kishor kii team ne ek nayaa saboot pesh karne kaa faisla kiya- golf kii ek chadi, jise unhone vahi bhothari cheez bataaya jisase aarushi kii maut hui
 Aarushi's throat was then slit by 'professional' hands with something sharp
 haalanki closer report main kaha gaya he ki ''hatya ke hathiyaar golf chadi ko aparaadh se joda nahin ja saktaa
 The servants were acquitted by Kishore's team, as they were not directly in the house
 phir ve kahaan the? kishor kii report ke mutabik, durrani (talwaar dampati ke paariwarik mitra) kaa gharelu naukar rajkumaar raat 11
 Was at the railway station since 30 as he went to pick up Durrani's wife
 durrani inkaar karte hai ki unhone sibiai ko is tarah kii koi baat bataai thi
 Krishna was detained by the Uttar Pradesh police from her house
 tab vah so rahaa tha
 The report stated that he was alone at home on the night of the murder, who were "direct witnesses" (who were members of Krishna's family)
 kishor kii team ne postmortem karne vaale doctoron se bhi poochtacha kii
 According to new facts, the place of head injury was different from the place reported in the earlier post-mortem report
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki ''aarushi ke guptang kii jhilli fat gai thi, or pehle se aisa tha
 "this was not in the original post-mortem report
 closer report main or bhi kai khamiyaan hai, jaise avkaash praapt police adhikari ke
 K
 gautam kii bhoomika, jinhone aarushi kii hatya ke ek din baad hemraj kii laash kaa pataa lagaaya
 According to the report, Gautam was acquainted with the Talwar family through a common friend and his service was used to remove the word 'rape' from Aarushi's postmortem report
 sibiai kahati he ki talwaar dampati ne pehle hemraj ke shav ko pahchaanane se inkaar kar diya, yah shaq paidaa karata he
 The report says that the golf cane was kept hidden for a year and cleaned thoroughly
 talwaar dampati ne hi sibiai jaanch kii maang kii thi
 The CBI has presented a blurred picture of the events of that night
 closer report kaa kul nishkarsh haih ''aparaadh main hatya kaa spasht makasad maujuud nahin he or ghatnaon ke kram kii jaankaree purna nahin he
 Also a weapon of crime has not been acquired and their relationship to servants or parents is not clear

 tippaniyan He said, if these problems had been brought to the fore, my decisions would have seemed normal and right, but whatever happened, it happened inside, you were given orders and instructions to behave differently
 adhikari ne kaha, agar aap aisi karrwai karte hai, jise aap kathor kehete hai, lekin main use sahi kahata hum or tab aapke khilaaf karrwai kii jaati he, to yah manobal ko giraane vaala or amanviya he or aapako khud par shame aati he

 ab tak desh main gujarat kaa vikaas model laane kaa khwab dikhaane vaale pradhanmantri narendra modi ke gujarat main vikaas se aage jativaadee raajnneeti ne in dinon soobe kii anandiben sarkaar ke saamne sawaal khadaa kar diya he
 The Patidar Reservation Movement and now the dalitcand have once again sparked the talk of Anandiben being removed as the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 mushkil main rajya or centre sarkaardarasaladalitkand mengis tarah sakht ection lene main anandiben sarkaar naakaamayaab rahi he, use dekhte hue sabhi raajnneetik partiyaan khud kii daal galane main lag gai hai
 It started with bsp's Mayawati raising the issue in Rajya Sabha and raising questions on Anandiben's law and order
 vahiin is par naa sirf rajya sarkaar, balkee centre sarkaar ke liye bhi jawaab dena kaaphi mushkil ho gaya he
 The people of the ruling party also once again questioned the CM of the state Anandiben against the status of Dalits in Gujarat against Anandiben
 anandiben ke khilaaf vipaksh hi nahin, ab to sattadhari party ke kuch asantusht netaa bhi is mudde ko hawa de rahe hai
 The attempt is to present it as a political crisis
 jahaan dekho vahaan ek bade dalit netaa banane kii hode machi he kaaran bhi spasht hachunavnajadik he
 Patidar movement also failed to deal with the Patidar movement Before the Dalitcand the Patidar movement became a major crisis, from which Anandiben had not emerged yet
 patidaar andolan ke baad om maathur ne ek report bijepi alaakaman ko saunpi thi, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki anandiben sarkaar patidaar andolan ko rokane main puri tarah naakaamayaab rahi he
 Not only this, internal fighting has also increased between BJP workers under Anandiben's rule
 is report ke baad lagaataar yah baat bhi ai thi ki aannadiben ko gujarat kii mukhyamantri pad se hataaya ja saktaa he
 Many ministers of his own cabinet are also coming up for Khafanandiben's rule that his son-daughter is the highest in Anandiben's government, so many ministers in Anandiben's own cabinet are angry with Anandiben
 yahi vajah he ki agar gujarat main koi andolan hota he, to mantri andolan ko rokane main niskriy ho jate hai
 In such a situation there is no damage control, nor is all the truth kept before the government
 is november 75 saal kii ho jaaengi anandibenanandiben kii umr ko lekar bhi unako siem pad se hataae jane kii atakalein baar-baar saamne aati hai
 In fact, in the BJP, it is said that leaders who are 75 years old are sent to the guiding board of the BJP
 haalanki anandiben bhi is november 75 saal kii ho rahi hai
 In such a situation, it is being said that Anandiben can be removed or made the Governor of a state or he will be sent to the Board of Guides
 ek baar phir dalit cond ke baad gujarat main faili hinsa ko rokane main naakaamayaab rahianandiben sarkaarko hataane kii baat hone lagi he
