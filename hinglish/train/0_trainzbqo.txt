 But on the occasion, his name was removed due to internal politics of the congress
from the Congress quota manch par congress ke cote se rajya ke congress adhyaksh or centre main mantri charan das mahant or madhyapradesh main chunavi kaman sanbhaalane vaale jyotiraditya sindhiya najar aae
 Ajit Jogi had to sit on the chairs in front of the stage after drinking a sip of blood
 vah philhal is masale par chuppi saadhe hai
 But before this, Jogi has repeatedly indicated that the Congress is ignoring and forcing him
 gauratlab he ki guuruuvaar ko bilaspur main antipisi ke sipat or lara super thermal power project ko raashtra ko samarpit karne pradhanmantri manmohan singh pahunche the
 According to a senior official, the anger was visible from Jogi's face, but the stage was completely under the protection of SPG security, so Jogi drank bitter sips
 pradesh main jogi or mahant ke bich chhidi jang ab kisi se chuphi nahin he, lekin jogi ke saath yah vyavhaar congress kii andruni kalah kii ore hi ishaara karata he kyonki kendriya vidyut mantralay kii ore se jari ishtihaaron main saaf taur par pradhanmantri ke saath jin aath ganmaanya logon kii garimamayi upasthiti kaa zikr kiya gaya he usamen purv mukhyamantri jogi kaa naam bhi aakhir main likhaa hua he
 It is clear that Jogi will not tolerate this insult silently, as the event was organized by the central government, hence Raman Singh government of the state cannot be accused
 haalanki jogi kii lagaataar congress ke prati badhati naaraazgi se bijepi kii baanche khili hui he
 The way the Raman Singh government has withdrawn the investigation report of the Vigilance Cell from the High Court in the ongoing controversy over Jogi's caste and has asked for a fresh investigation, the BJP government has given relief to Jogi
 haalanki jogi virdohi is maamle ko raman-jogi kii santhganth ke taur par bhi prachaarit kar rahe hai
 The PM was speaking and the public was making noise at the inauguration ceremony of ntpc's Super Thermal Power Station in Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, when strange-o-poor situation arose when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh started giving a speech
 dhime swar main bolne vaale manmohan kii aawaaj vahaan maujuud shrotaaon tak nahin pahunch paa rahi thi
 Due to this, people sitting there suddenly started making noise
 yah shor aisa tha jaise skool main achaanak bijli gul hone par maujuud chaatr karne lagate hai
 The organizer and SPG immediately swung into action to deal with this uncomfortable situation and asked to install some more mikes
 lekin khud piem ne mike ko thik kar bolnaa shuru kiya
 Taking a dig at this entire atmosphere, a senior leader's comment was, 'people adjusted themselves to the pm's voice
 ’ Senior National Conference leader Omar Abdullah has targeted the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the promotion of Lok Sabha Election 2019 in Kashmir
 kashmir (kashmir) ghati main bijepi dwaara prachaar saamagree main bhagava ke bajaay hare rang kaa upyog karne par sawaal uthaaya he
 He has said that the saffron color of the BJP has turned green when it reaches the Kashmir Valley
 umr abdulla (omar Abdullah) ne kashmir main bijepi ke ek pratyaashee ke poster ke photo ke saath kiye gaye ek twit main bijepi (BJP) ko gheraa he
 There has been a lot of reactions to his tweet, in which photographs of the BJP flag have been put
 umr abdulla (omar Abdullah) ne srinagar (srinagar) loksabhaa kshetra ke bijepi (BJP) ke ummidavaar khalid jahangir ke ek poster ke photo ke saath twit kiya he- 'bijepi kaa bhagava rang kashmir main pahunchane ke baad haraa ho jaataa he
 i am not sure that this party really believes that she can fool voters while she is showing herself to be stupid in this way
 vah ghati main prachaar karte hue apana asal rang kyon nahin dikhaati?'the saffron of the BJP turns green when it reaches Kashmir
 I'm not sure whether the party truly believes it can fool voters when it makes a fool of itself like this
 Why can't they show their true colours while campaigning in the valley? # Election2019pic

 Recently there was a sharp reaction to Omar Abdullah's statement that Kashmir was a separate Wazir Azam (prime Minister)
 piem modi (PM Modi) ne jammu-kashmir ke liye alag se piem banane kii baat ko lekar ek chunavi raily main umr ke saath-saath congress ko bhi gheraa tha
 He had asked the Congress whether he supported this statement of the leader of the National Conference? PM Modi (PM Modi) said that Omar Abdullah wants a separate PM to be created for Jammu and Kashmir
 main umr kii is raay par mahagathbandhan main shaamil unki sabhi sahyogi partiyon se spashtikaran maangana chaahunga
 They all tell if they support Omar's statement
 is mudde par bollywood produsar ashok pandit ne bhi neshnal conference ke netaa umr abdulla (omar Abdullah) ko twitor par nishaanaa banaate hue likhaa ki ve kashmir ke pradhanmantri bananaa chaahate hai
 This tweet of Ashok Pandit went viral on social media

 Gautam Gambhir targeted Omar Abdullah's statement on him
 iske baad umr abdulla ne bhi unhen sirf cricket khilne kii naseehat de di
 Significantly, Omar Abdullah referred to Jammu and Kashmir being a separate Prime Minister years ago and reinstating the state to protect its identity after BJP leaders favored scrapping Article 370
 gaujammu-kashmir se dhara 370 hataae jane ko lekar rajya kii purv mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ne bhi tippanee kii thi
 He said a few days ago that if this happens then we will have to rethink whether we have to live with India or not
 rajeev kumaar ko sharada chit fund ghotaale main aaropirajiv kumaar par sabooton ko nasht karne kaa aropakendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) ne kolkata ke purv police kamishnar rajeev kumaar kii a grim jamaanat ko supreme court main chunauti di he
 Rajiv Kumar was recently granted anticipatory bail by the Calcutta High Court in the Saradha chit fund scam case
 sibiai ke sutron ne india today ko bataaya ki hoicourt ke aadesh kaa adhyayan karne ke baad sibiai ne supreme court main ise chunauti di he
 CBI challenged on this basis? Sources said that CBI has challenged Rajiv Kumar's anticipatory bail on the ground that he did not cooperate in the investigation and kept on avoiding
 unke khilaaf paryaapt saboot hai or jaanch puri karne ke liye unako hiraasat main lekar poochtacha karnaa jaruri he
 The CBI had already clarified that it wanted to arrest Rajiv Kumar
 sibiai kaa daawa he ki rajeev kumaar ko agrim jamaanat uske liye ek fori jhatka he
 Sources said, 'we need to interrogate them by detaining them
 hamaare paas jo saboot hai or jo kagajaat hai, supreme court or hoicourt ne pehle hi unki jaanch kar lee he
 'rajiv had not appeared before Rajiv Kumar had appealed for protection from arrest of CBI in Calcutta High Court, but his petition was rejected by the High Court
 haalanki, nichali adaalat se bhi rajeev kumaar kii yachika khaarij hone ke baad unhone mangalvaar ko hoicourt main dobaaraa apil kii
 The High Court gave him a huge relief and granted him anticipatory bail on a personal bond of 50,000
 jamaanat dete hue court ne rajeev kumaar ko jaanch main sahyog karne kaa nirdesh bhi diya tha
 There was no trace of Rajiv Kumar for the past three weeks

 The CBI searched over a dozen locations
 rajeev kumaar kii patni or staff se bhi unke pate thikaane ke bare main poochtacha kii gai, lekin agency unka pataa nahin laga saki
 According to the CBI, Rajiv Kumar has been involved in tampering of evidence, as well as accusing him of protecting some leaders from investigation in the Saradha and Rose Valley chit fund scams
 rajeev kumaar ko panshchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee kaa kareebi bataaya jaataa he
 CBI claim: Earlier, on the court's order, CBI called Rajiv Kumar for questioning
 sibiai kaa daawa he ki rajeev kumaar netritv main ek vishesh jaanch dal (SIT) ne chit fund ghotaale kii jaanch kii thi
 Rajiv Kumar is accused of destroying the evidence and saving the accused
 sibiai ne supreme court ko bataaya he ki vah rajeev kumaar ko hiraasat main lekar jaanch karnaa chaahati he kyonki prathamdrishtya unke khilaaf saboot hai ki unhone sabooton ko nasht karne or aropiyon ko bachaane kii koshish kii
 Rajiv Kumar was the head of the SIT investigating the scams and was formed by SIT Mamta Banerjee in 2013 and 2014
 baad main yah cese supreme court ne sibiai ko saunp diya tha

 Among the long queues of trains at the five tolls of arrival in Mumbai, there was a lot of confusion about the holiday between the passengers and toll workers, there was also confusion
 tippaniyan The queues at the five toll plazas, the five toll plazas, to enter the city of Mumbai, which did not have holidays, were left with a big twist
 jo card se pement karnaa chaahate the, wo bhi cash-les nahin ho paae
 Many complained that toll workers were not taking 2000 notes, the toll workers had their own arguments
 9 november se alag-alag antaraal par 2 disambar tak logon ko toll bharne se chuttay kii vajah se chuttee mili, lekin jaise hi toll khule, mumbai ke daravaajon par bheed badhane lagi
 Each toll has claimed a loss of around 2 crore due to the closure of the toll plaza for 23 days
 lekin jaankaar kehete hai ki in kataron ke hatane se jo eendhan or vakt bachaa he wo nuksaan kii bharpai ke aasapaas he

 At different intervals from 9 November until 2 December, people were discharged from the toll filling, but as soon as the toll opened, the doors of Mumbai started to get crowded
 lagbhag 23 din toll plaza band rahane se har toll ne lagbhag 2 karod ke nuksaan kaa daawa kiya he
 But experts say that the fuel and time left due to the removal of these queues is around compensating for the loss

 do sadhviyon ke saath dushkarm or ek patrkaar kii hatya ke maamle main jail main bandaram rahim (gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh) ke dere par ab bhi netaa maathaa tech rahe hai
 The only difference is that this time the top level leaders of the parties are refraining from making public appearances in the camp due to fear of loss of image, but contesting on the ticket of various parties from the Dera-dominated Sirsa and surrounding seats in Haryana
 The leaders are not missing their heads
 gurmeet ram rahim ke deraa sachcha sauda kaa mukhyalay sirsa main he
 Sirsa is both a Lok Sabha and an assembly seat
 yahaan se bhaajapa ke tikat par vidhansabha chunaav lard rahe pradeep ratusariya se lekar haryana janhit party se chunaav maidan main utre gopal kanda tak dere par maathaa tech kar samarthan maang chuke hai
 Gopal Kanda, earlier Air Hostess Geetika Sharma has been in the news due to the suicide case
 2009 ke vidhansabha chunaav main gopal kanda yahaan se chunaav jeet chuke hai
 In 2014, he lost by just 2900 votes
 is baar 2019 ke vidhansabha chunaav jeetne ke liye vah deraa sachcha sauda kaa aashirwad lekar 2014 kii kasar puri karne kii koshish main hai
 Talking about the electoral history of Sirsa Assembly seat, the BJP won only once here in 1996
 ab tak hue 12 chunaavon main paanch baar congress ko jeet mili he
 Makhanlal Singla won on INLD ticket in 2014, later he joined BJP
 deraa sachcha sauda kii ek raajnneetik ikai he, jo chunaavon ke ain maukon par partiyon yaa ummidavaar vishesh ke paksh main vot daalane kii samarthakon se apil karti he
 Dera Sacha Sauda officials claim that nearly 50 lakh supporters in Haryana and Punjab vote on an appeal by Dera chief Ram Rahim
 2014 ke loksabhaa or haryana vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ke kai bade netaaon ke dere main hajiri lagane ke kaaran gurmeet ram rahim ne party ko khulaa samarthan diya tha
 After the victory, many leaders who became ministers in the Manohar Lal Khattar government later arrived in the camp to show gratitude to Gurmeet Ram Rahim
 netaaon kii hajiri tab charchaa main thi
 The situation changed in 2017, when on August 28, a CBI court sentenced Gurmeet Singh to 10–10 years imprisonment in both the cases in the rape of two sadhvis
 phir baad main patrkaar ram chand chhatrapati kii hatya ke maamle main bhi gurmeet ko sajaa hui
 After Gurmeet went to jail, with the decrease in the number of devotees in the camp, the big leaders also shied away
 ab chunaav ke vakt phir netaaon kii awajahi shuru hui he
 The special thing is that due to Gurmeet being in jail, the dera has not appealed to vote in favor of anyone, while there is only one day (21 October) left to vote
 isse purv ke chunaavon main deraa kii raajnneetik shakha kisi pratyaashee yaa party ke paksh main apil karti rahi he

 The prospects of Akhilesh Yadav contesting elections from Azamgarh parliamentary seat have not only been explored at the local level, but the party's senior leaders have also invited the SP president to contest
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke baad sapa ke liye ye seat kaaphi surakshit maani ja rahi he
 Although nothing is being said publicly in SP about contesting elections from Azamgarh seat of Akhilesh, but the party is churning with seriousness in eating inside

 Akhilesh Yadav has not yet made any gesture to contest from Azamgarh seat
 lekin party ke bheetar akhilesh kii ummidavaari ko lekar manthan kiya ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will contest from Purvanchal's Varanasi and Akhilesh can contest from Azamgarh

 Rahul told reporters in the Parliament House Complex, i went to the banks myself to see the situation myself in the morning
 vahaan logon ne mujhe bataaya ki unhen bahut asuvidha ho rahi he
 Due to opposition from the opposition parties on the issue of demonetisation, the proceedings of both the Houses had to be postponed several times today
 rahul ne kaha ki log aarope laga rahe hai ki kuch chuninda logon ke liye bainkon main pichley daravaajon se nakadi nikaali ja rahi he jabaki aam aadmi ghanton lambii kataron main khadaa he
 He said, people said that they are standing in queues and bargaining is taking place and cash is being withdrawn from the back door
 kuch chuninda logon ko nakadi di ja rahi he
 The rich are getting cash and the poor are being queued
 rahul ke mutabik, log teen din tak qatari main khadey rahenge or phir bina nakadi ke chale jaaenge
 Rahul visited several atms in the city this morning and asked people about their problems
 sansad main pradhanmantri ke maujuud nahin rahane ke sawaal par rahul ne kaha, pradhanmantri ko sansad aane kii kya jarurat he? in dinon vah alag str par hai
 He neither talks to his ministers nor talks to any other, which he feels, decides on his own
 unhone kaha, desh ke itihaas main itnaa bada aarthik faisla liya gaya or unhone teen-chaar logon se baat karne ke baad yah kiya
 There was no plan
 kisaanon, garibon kaa kya hoga
 What will happen to the fisheries business in Kerala and Bengal? unhone in logon ke bare main nahin sochaa
 Attacking PM Modi, the Congress Vice President said, "these days he is in a new form
" aap unhen super piem bhi nahin bol sakate
 One has to think to define them
 unhen paribhaashit karne ke liye koi nayaa shabd gadhana hoga
 Rahul also expressed condolences over the death of people in a train accident near Kanpur on Sunday and said that instead of bringing bullet trains, the Prime Minister should focus first on increasing convenience and safety for the general public in trains
 tippaniyan He said, the structure of Indian Railways needs to be repaired
 modi ji ne ek lakh karod rupee ke nivesh ke saath bullate train kii baat kii
 The wrong place is meditation
 dhyaan is baat par hona chahie ki aam janata ke liye trainon main safar karnaa kaise surakshit ho

 kaaryvahak mukhya nyaayadhish ares jha or nyaayamurti ve ke shukla kii peeth ne brihaspativaar ko yah nirdesh jari kiye
 Advocate Zubin Prasad, appearing for the Minister for Social Justice and Disabled Welfare, told pti-language on Friday that since the petitioner had told the court that the minister had uploaded his statement on youtube not to remove the encroachment, the court a video of his explanation given by the minister has also been directed to be uploaded on youtube
 ullekhneey he ki jabalpur main madanmahal evam siddh baba pahari sahit anya pahadiyon par saikadon logon ne kabza kar rakhaa he
 In this case, on the petitions of Kishori Lal Bhalavi of Garha Goundwana Patron Association and others including advocate Zaki Ahmed, the High Court had ordered removal of encroachment from here
 pichley maheene ek kaarykram ke dauraan ghanghoria ne atikaramanakariyon ke paksh main bayaan diya tha
 He had said that no Siddha Baba can remove encroachment from the hill
 unka yah bayaan utyub par aplod kar diya gaya, jisase yah soshal media main viral ho gaya
 On this statement of the minister, Aditya Narayan Shukla said in an application in the High Court that in a meeting held on the hill of Siddhababa, Ghanghoria not only opposed the action of removing the encroachments but also made objectionable remarks on the court's order Also worked to provoke people
 shukla ne iske video you-taub main aplod hone kii jaankaree bhi peeth ko di thi
 On the last hearing date, Ghanghoria had unconditionally apologized and replied to the court in the entire case
 lekin, adaalat ne ise naakaafi pate hue unhen evam sarkaar ko jawaab dene ke nirdesh diye the
 The bench had directed the minister to present his clarification among the people by holding a public meeting
 iske baad mantri ne ek oktober ko jansabha kar janata ke bich atikaraman par diye apane bayaan ke liye maafee maang kar spashtikaran diya tha
 The next hearing of the case will be on 9 November

 ek disambar ko uttar pradesh ke 652 shahari sthaneey nikaayon ke chunaav parinaam ghoshit kiye gaye
 This was a rare occasion when Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath did not leave his 5, Kalidas Marg residence in Lucknow
 teen baje ke baad tak nahin, ve tab baahar nikle, jab 16 bade shaharon ke nagar nigamon main se 14 main bhaajapa ko aadhikarik rup se vijayi ghoshit kiya gaya
 Only then did the Chief Minister come out to celebrate the victory along with other party leaders
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan yogi adityanath ne puure rajya ko chaan daalaa or 30 se zyada saarvajanik sabhaaon ko sambodhit kiya
 Apart from the old corporations like Lucknow, Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Gorakhpur, Agra, Bareilly, Ghaziabad, Moradabad and Jhansi, the BJP won four new corporations — Ayodhya, Saharanpur, Firozabad and Mathurakra
 bhaajapa ke rishikesh upaadhyaay ne ayodhya ke pehle mahayor chunaav main sapa ke gulshan bindu ko pahada
 Although significant, the BSP was successful in Meerut and Aligarh's Dangal, both of these important corporations of western Uttar Pradesh were earlier occupied by the BJP
 haalanki party kahin bhi ''baari jeet' ke kareeb nahin pahunchi, lekin party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne daawa kiya ki bhaajapa ne nishchit rup se sthaneey nikaay chunaav main apane pradarshan main sudhaar kiya he
 Apart from 14 posts of Mayor, 596 out of 1,299 Municipal Councilor posts are now with BJP
 nigam ke kul padon ke 45
 The BJP now holds 9 per cent of the posts, which is about 15 per cent more than the seats won by the BJP in the 2012 municipal elections
 ullekhneey he ki bhaajapa ne bade shaharon main acha pradarshan kiya he
 Even in 2012, the BJP won 10 out of the 12 municipal corporations
 lekin chote shaharon kii nagar parishadon, nagarpalikaon yaa nagar panchayaton main tasviir itani gulabi nahin he or isse mukhyamantri adityanath or party netritv, donon waakif hai
 The relief for the BJP is that it is miles ahead of the scattered opposition parties
 yah sach he ki basapa ne mahatvapurn dakhsandaji kii he, khaskar pashchimi uttar pradesh main or yahaan tak mayawati ne bhi sthaneey netaaon ko prachaar abhiyaan chalaane kii anumati di, lekin banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay ke samaaj vigyaani ajit kumaar kaa tark he, ''yah dalit-muslim card khelkar or anivaary rup se samaajawaadee party kii keemat par mili safalataa he
 "neither the Akhilesh Yadav-led SP nor the Congress contested in the absence of Rahul Gandhi benefited from any party
 rahul ke loksabhaa kshetra kii do nagar parishadon-jaais or gauriganj main congress kii sharmnaak haar par tanj kasate hue mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne kaha, ''jo log gujarat main bhaajapa ko haraane kii baat karte hai, ve amethi main chunaav haar gaye
 Despite chairing the 45 municipal councils and winning 83 seats in the Nagar Panchayats, the Samajwadi Party also suffered the embarrassment of losing the election of mayor in Firozabad, represented in Lok Sabha by Akshay Yadav, son of National General Secretary Ram Gopal Yadav
 uttar pradesh ke purv har nagar nikaay chunaavon kii tarah nirdaleeyon ne acha pradarshan kiya, khaskar nagar parishadon or nagar panchayaton main
 In addition to 224 councilors, 225 independents were elected presidents of the municipal council and nagar panchayat and 7,255 were elected as councilors and panchayat members
 haalanki unamem se kai raajnneetik dalon se taalluk rakhte the
 Now the picture of which side the independents will sit will be revealed in the coming weeks
 parinaam ghoshit hone ke agle din adityanath pradhanmantri se milane dilli chale gaye, yah jaanane ke liye ki bhaajapa ke andruni sutron ne 'achche kaam ke yash' ke rup main kya kaha
 It is believed that this victory will give the Chief Minister encouragement, the national leadership will now trust him more and he will get more freedom to run the state
 iskaa taatkaalik prabhaav yah he ki ve sheeghra hi cabinet ke teraa khaali padon ko bharne ke liye mantrimandal vistaar kar sakate hai
 The win also gives him an opportunity to review the performance of his current ministers in the local body elections, who were entrusted with the responsibility in the election
 isamen in chunaavon main asangat pradarshan kaa vishleshan bhi shaamil hoga or un kshetron kaa pratinidhitiv badhaayaa ja sakegaa, jahaan bhartiya janata party ne bura pradarshan kiya he
 With barely a little more than a year left for the Lok Sabha elections 2019, Adityanath is increasingly taking steps to compensate for the gluttony in focusing on smaller municipal cities
 vibhinn pradarshan maapdandon (jinamein centre kii tarj par vyapaar sugamawa bhi shaamil he) par pratispardhaatmak rup se alag-alag jilon ko khara utaarne kii yojana ke alaava unhone adhikariyon ko ardh shahari kshetron ke liye vistrut vikaas yojanaayen taiyaar karne kaa nirdesh diya he
 He has asked the Public Works Department of the state to prepare a report on the status of roads in such areas
 lagata he, yogi rajya prashasan ke majboot pahaluon or uttar pradesh jaise bade rajya ke prabandhan kii chunauti ke virodhabhaason se nibatane kii thaan chuke hai
 Becoming the captain of Bigg Boss house is obviously the funniest thing in Bigg Boss house

 Bigg Boss then assigns a task to these two people, the winner of which will be made the next captain of the house

 They have to choose theirs together which will serve to keep the bottles in the box

 Andy and Gauhar jump into the pool and start collecting bottles

 dilli ke sarkari aspataalon main karmchaariyon kii niyukti ko lekar ek baar phir se uparajyapal anil baijal or mukhyamantri arvind ke bich tanaav kii sthiti ban gai he
 The condition is that the Chief Minister has written a letter to the Lieutenant Governor, accusing him of bypassing the officers
 unhone likhaa ki kya kaaran he ki alji adhikariyon ko mantriyon or mukhyamantri ko file na dikhaane ke liye bol rahe hai
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has mentioned in the letter that he had a meeting in August with the Medical Superintendents of Delhi Government hospitals where serious complaints of staff shortage were received in the hospitals
 shikaayat ke aadhaar par siem ne faisla liya gaya tha ki aspataalon ke khaali padon ko bharne ke liye emes ko contract par visheshgy niyukt karne kaa adhikaar hoga
 According to Kejriwal, he had also instructed the Chief Secretary to get approval from LG
 alji ko bheji chitthee main kejariwal ne aapatti jataate hue likhaa he ki emes ko adhikaar dene vaali fil jab unhone senior adhikariyon se maangi to hairaan karne vaala jawaab mila
 According to CM Kejriwal, senior officials did not send the file saying that they had received orders from LG not to show the file to any minister Yasim
 philhal, siem ne alji ke saamne fil bhejne kii maang rakhi he
 According to CM Kejriwal, Delhi government hospitals have ventilators but do not have staff to operate it
 iske alaava eks-re, siti scan or emarai jaisi mashine chalaane ke liye bhi staff kii baari kami he
 In the letter, the CM himself is claiming that lack of a drug counter in government hospitals is the main reason for not being a pharmacist

 Unsupervised rafting guides and helpers, the adventurous youngsters from the metropolitan cities for rafting, the greed of rafting businessmen and the government's inattention are increasing the risk associated with it
 rishikesh ko river rafting kaa makka kaha jaataa he or yahaan har saal hajaaron adventure lover rafting ke liye pahunchate hai
 But neither the government has ever warned nor have the rafting business been able to take full security measures

 Everything is going on the basis of the mandate issued by the Uttar Pradesh government for river rafting on September 25, 1999
 jabaki ek dashak main river rafting kaa kaarobaar kahin aage nikal chukaa he
 "when rafting started in Rishikesh in 1984-85, there were only 2-3 companies and only foreign tourists used to come for rafting," says 29-year-old Anurag Payal, secretary of the Adventure Tourism Rafting Committee
 lekin aaj yahaan 140 registerd rafting companiyaan or kareeb 500 rafting booking counter hai
 "the rafting crisis also draws adventure lovers because it has the longest rafting season of eight months
" codiphala-rishikesh kaa 40 kimi lanbaa rafting aria or 4-5 grad kii tej jaldharaayein is aakarshan ko badhaati hai
 The rafting season takes place in Rishikesh from 1 September to 30 June
 is dauraan yahaan ek lakh se adhik paryatak river rafting ke liye pahunchate hai
 Says Narendra Negi, 40, director of the Bega Board Adventure, "the first three months of the season start from 8 to 10,000 tourists for weekend rafting
 ’’rafting ke kaam main lagi 140 registerd companiyon main se 40 companiyaan dilli-ensiaar ke bade kaarobaariyon kii hai
 More than 500 rafts run in Rishikesh
 paryaton or van vibhaag sanyukt rup se raft chalaane kaa license dete hai
 But due to the slow process of licensing and no structure of rafting monitoring is in place, the lives of tourists are at risk

 Arun Kukasal says, "because of being a Devabhoomi, the gods are saving the lives of tourists here
 ’’ rishikesh main rafting ke niyamon kaa khulaa ulanghan ho rahaa he
 Kukasal asks, where have the boys who are rafting guides taken their training? To become a mountain guide, it is also necessary to do basic, advanced, search and rescue courses of mountaineering
 saath hi mountain guide kaa course karnaa bhi jaruri he
 As per international regulations, courses like basic rafting and water search and rescue are also required for rafting guides, but there is no training initiative for rafting guides so far
 negi kehete hai ki yahaan aise ladke rojgaar ke liye guide ban rahe hai, jinke paas buniyadi prashikshan bhi nahin he
 Being unskilled laborers, their wages are also low

 a company has at least two rafts
 15 se zyada aisi companiyaan hai, jinke paas ausatan 10 raft hai
 It is normal to make two rounds per raft in a season
 aise main in companiyon kaa arthshaastra behatar samajha ja saktaa he
 a small company with two rafts is also required to make a minimum of Rs 5,000 for two rounds

 Earnings have increased the business race manifold
 is vakt jahaan 140 companiyaan rafting ke kaarobaar main lagi hai, vahiin may, 2010 ke baad ek bhi nai rafting company ko sarkaar ne anumati nahin di he
 Tourism Secretary Umakant Panwar says, "the government is finalizing new guidelines regarding rafting
 iske baad hi nai companiyon ko ijaajat di jaaegi
 The government's objection to the new companies is that they do not have trend guides, while Pawar has no answer as to where the guides of the companies that are currently working have received training
 ek taraf mountenearing guide banane ke liye centre se lekar rajya sarkaar tak ne anek vishwastareey santhaan khole hai, vahiin rafting guide banane ke liye shortkurt chunaa he
 The helper on whose head the rafting association laid its hands became the guide
 vartmaan niyam ke mutabik aavedan karte samay rafting company ko apane upkarnon ke byore ke saath hi do rafting gidon or helparon kaa byora bhi dena hota he
 This detail is attested by the Rafting Association, Forest Department and local tourism authorities
 sarkaar ne to rafting guide prashikshan kii koi pahal nahin kii lekin indian association of profeshnal rafting outfitres (ipro) ne gidon ko prashikshit karne kaa abhiyaan chalaaya he
 In the third week of March 2013, by running a two-day training camp, ipro trained the guides with risk management as well as risk management
 ipro kii adhyaksh or 1987 se rafting kaarobaari kiran bhatta toderiya kahati hai, ‘‘ham to apni ore se puri koshish kar rahe hai ki kaarobaar bade or kaarobaar tabhi badhegaa jab hamaare guide antarrashtriya maanakon ke hisaab se honge
 We are also going to provide medical help and rescue training to the guides
 ’’guide banane kaa ab tak kaa pattern yah rahaa he ki kuch maheene tak kisi duusare guide ke saath helper rahane ke baad companiyaan use apni raft main guide rakh leti hai
 New guides are also cheaper than old ones
 saahasik paryaton rafting samiti ke adhyaksh dharmendra negi ise bura nahin maanate hai
 He says it is similar to the guru-disciple tradition, where seniors teach their junior helpers as guides
 lekin hakeekat main un guruon ne bhi kabhi rafting guide kii training nahin lee he
 Many guides even accept this
 trans himalaya company ke guide 18 varshiya pramod dhondial kehete hai, ‘‘main akele hi aath logon ko apni raft main le jaataa hum
 i have taken three to four months training in Trans Himalaya Company itself
 kabhi koi profeshnal rafting training nahin lee he
 The Nepali youth working as a raft helper in one such adventure company had never sat on the raft before becoming a 20-year-old Prakash Helper
 or kuch maheene bataur helper kaam karne ke baad ab vah guide ban jayega
 These two youths get Rs
 5,000 per month respectively
 or 2,000 ru
 Get salary saaf he ki companiyaan paisa bachaane ke liye bhi kam anbhavi yuvakon ko guide rakh rahi hai
 Currently, around 15,000 people in Rishikesh are involved in the rafting business, so it has become necessary to take seriously the safety measures associated with it

 Praveen lodged a missing disappearance of his 32-bore revolver at Transport Nagar police station in the city on 11 December
 transport nagar thane ke prabharee ashutosh kumaar ne mangalvaar ko ieenes ko bataaya ki praveen ne apni shikaayat main kaha ki gat 9 disambar se revolver ghar par nahin mil rahi he
 Kumar said that investigation into the case has been started, as of now no clue has been found
 kumaar ke mutabik praveen us din multan nagar sthit apane ghar ke ahaate main prashansakon se mil rahe the
 Kumar said, "after much research in the house, when the revolver was not found, Praveen contacted us and complained of missing
 praveen kii taraf se yah ashanka bhi jataai gai he ki ho saktaa he unhone ghar main bhulvash kisi aisi jagah revolver rakh di ho, jisase milane main pareshaani ho rahi he
 "praveen's elder brother Vinay Kumar, who was out of the Indian team due to injury, told that it was only after being selected in the Indian team that Praveen bought a revolver for himself
 unke paas iskaa license bhi he
 Surprisingly, like Harbhajan's bag, nothing is known about Praveen's revolver
 harbhajan ne somvaar ko ghatana ke vakt bataaya tha ki unke bag main passport, atm card, credit card or laptop tha
 Police said that some unidentified thieves broke the window of Harbhajan's Ford Endeavor car and stole the goods

 When an attempt was made to know from the regional SP MLA Mohammad Rizvi that despite such a big incident, why did the top officials of the district not come to the spot? So his reply was that both the accident and the entertainment are different, after all, peace has to be seen in the fair

 Earlier there was a controversy over such news that the trophy given to the Indian team on Saturday was fake
 media report main kaha gaya ki mahendra singh dhoni or unki team ko jo trophy di gai vah nakli thi or asli trophy shulk kaa bhugtan nahin hone ke kaaran mumbai main seemaa shulk vibhaag ke paas padi he
 Many former cricketers had expressed their displeasure over the alleged negligence of the ICC and BCCI
 in daavon ke baad isisi ne somvaar subah yah bayaan jari kiya ki bhartiya cricket team ko jo trophy di gai vah asli thi
 The ICC said in a statement that contrary to some erroneous and mischievous media reports, the ICC confirms that the trophy given to India at the Wankhede Stadium on Saturday was the original ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 trophy and it was the one that always won the winner of the competition
 Was to be given unhone kaha ki aisa koi sawaal hi nahin uthta ki yah pratikruti he

 Now they will remain suspended
 ’ ab teenon cricketron ko isisi ke aachaar samhita ayog ke samaj pesh hona hoga
 Bellof said, "the players have denied the allegations but they will remain suspended until the commission is formed

 chhattisgarh main congress ne ganga jal lekar kasam khai ki rajya kii satta main aane par das din ke bheetar kisaanon kaa karj maaf karenge
 From the big leaders of the party to the small leaders, even by swearing at the mother Ganga, the farmers have to be convinced that they are not making false promises with the farmers
 vahiin bijepi kii daleel he ki congress bhale hi gangaajal lekar kasam kha le lekin kisaan unke jhaanse main nahin aaenge
 At the Rajiv Bhavan, the Congress headquarters in Raipur, all Congress leaders swore that their debt would be forgiven within ten days if they came to power
 rajya main congress ne apane party ghoshnaptr main bhi is baat kaa hawala diya he ki yadi party satta main ai to sabase pehlekisanonka karj maaf hoga
 The farmers are stunned by this promise of the Congress, but they are not sure that the Congress Party will really fulfill its promise
 raajnneetik dalon ke vaadon ko lekar kisaanon kaa anubhav acha nahin rahaa he, isliye wo congress ke ghoshnaptr ko hi nahin balki uske netaaon ke vaadon ko bhi sirf chhalaava samaj rahe hai
 At the same time, BJP has also claimed the debt waiver of farmers
 party kii daleel he ki mukhyamantri raman singh ne kisaanon ke kalyaan ke liye ek se badhkar ek aisi yojanaayen chalaai hai jisase kisaanon ke saamne karj lene kii naubat hi naa aae
 The party has also said that the Raman Singh government of the state has waived loans of more than three and a half lakh farmers every year
 bijepi or congress ke vaadon se kanphyus kisaaniske maddenjar kisaanon main kanfusion he ki bijepi ke vaade par yakeen karen yaa phir congress ke
 In fact, along with these farmers, BJP had also promised in the last assembly elections that it would increase the support price of paddy by Rs 2100 per quintal
 saath hi saath 300 rupee prati quintal ke hisaab se bonus bhi degi
 Not only this, the BJP also promised that the grain of the farmer's crop will be taken
 lekin party satta main ai to dhan kaa samarthan mulya main mahaj 300 rupee kii badhotaree hui
 The support price of paddy increased from Rs 1450 to Rs 1750
 lekin vaade ke anuroop 2100 rupee nahin hua
 However, as per bjp's promise, Chief Minister Raman Singh gave bonus for only 3 years instead of giving bonus for full five years, and instead of taking one grain of farmers' crop, only 15 quintals of paddy per acre were purchased from farmers
 
 aise main kisaan congress or bijepi donon hi dalon ko andeh kii nigahon se dekh rahe hai
 Explain that a large population in Chhattisgarh is associated with farming
 rajya main 20 lakh ke lagbhag registerd kisaan hai jabaki gaiyr registerd kisaanon kii sankhya 15 lakh se zyada he
 No political party is behind to grab the votes of farmers and their families
 chote dal hon yaa bade dal, netaa rashtriya str kaa ho yaa phir sthaneey kaa har koi kisaanon ko lubhaane or manaane main lage hai

 dilli police ne shanivaar ko aam aadmi party ke ummidavaar balbir singh jakhad ke samvaadadaata sammelan main hastkshep karne kii koshish kii
 Police say this is a violation of the model code of conduct
 haalanki, jakhad ne police ke hastkshep ke baavjood samvaadadaata sammelan kiya, jiske baad police ne is bare main chunaav adhikariyon ko soochna de di

 jakhad ne matdaan se pehle kii 48 ghante kii avadhi ke dauraan samvaadadaata sammelan kiya

 In these tours, not only the country, but also people from Kyoto Japan have visited here and in every tour they have claimed thousands of crores to make our own city number one on the world map

 he kisi main himmat ki hamen haath laga de, jabaki hamen hataane ke liye nagar nigam ke paas 2700 safaikarmiyon ke saath jesibi, danpar, danpar cresar, tanker, hoper or chota hoper kaa puraa laav-lashkar taiyaar he
 Despite this no one can move us from his place
 bas itnaa kar paata he ki ek jagah se uthaakar duusari jagah kii saiyr bhar kara detaa he or is saiyr ko ham bade maje se isliye karte hai ki hamen pataa he ki hamaare liye, jo inhone damping plant bana rakhaa he usamen karsada damping plant kaa sanchaalan thap he or ramana damping plant kaa rasta to kharaab he hi saath hi vahaan ke gramin hi hamen nahin aane denge
 Our own existence also thrives in the narrow streets of our own city, because in these streets we do not get free space to keep (garbage)
 lihaaja container rakhane main bhi fajihat he
 And the scavengers just do the cleaning
 aise main main bade maje se seenaa taane padaa hum
 Yes, we had some problems last year
 jab atuged vaale ghar-ghar se hamen uthaa kar hamaare apane priy shahar or galiyon se dur le jaakar nistarit kar rahe the
 There was a little panic then, but there was also a certainty in my mind that all these days would not go on, because we knew that corrupt municipal officials, leaders, councilors would be tempted to run for money in such a way that he would run away
 or hua bhi vahi
 Now every day new schemes are made to remove us, money comes and gets distributed
 udhar, hamen hataane ke naam par adhikari or netaa mast hai or idhar ham sadakon par apana samrajya failaae magan hai
 It is not that we have never felt threatened by our existence
 jab hamaare saansad pradhanmantri bane to unhone swatchta kii baat bade joro se kahi
 When Banaras came, he started sweeping himself
 itnaa hi nahin unhone yaheen par apane safai ke navratna bhi ghoshit kar die
 Initially, there was enthusiasm in these Navratnas
 inhone bhi apane-apane navratna ghoshit kar die to thodaa man main dar laga, par ek taraf nischitanta yah thi ki ye navratna jis tarah thodaa-sa jhaadoo lagaakar photo zyada khinchvaa rahe the, tabhi laga ki ye hamen kya hataa paaenge
 This thing came true
 aaj ye sab photobaj kahaan he, kisi ko nahin chintaa
 Therefore, our own existence remains everywhere
 piem ke sansadeey kshetra kaa hone kaa phayda sirf hamen hi nahin he balki hamaari saheli siver ke pani kii bhi khub mouj he
 We stay in one place only
 vahiin se sara najaara dekhte hai, par hamaari saheli siver rani kii jagah-jagah pipe line tuuti he, vah baahar nikalakar sadakon par or phir vahaan se gharon main jo pani kii supplai ja rahi he uske pipe ke jariye saiyr karti he
 People are forced to drink sewer water
 maje kii baat yah he ki ise bhi rokane vaala koi nahin, kyonki jal santhaan ke adhikari ise rokane ke liye karodon rupee kii yojana banaakar bhej chuke hai or is baat ke intazaar main hai ki jab paanch das saal main yah paisa aayega tab dekha jayega
 Until then, they are filling their bags in the name of repair
 vaise bhi jeenyuarem ke tahat jo siver pipe line daali ja rahi hai, uske bhi koi myne nahin hai, kyonki is pipe line ko jis astipi tak le jaaenge us astipi ke liye abhi jameen hi nahin mil pai he
 So even though crores of rupees have come for this, we cannot disturb the fun of people
 sadak par dhan ugaate aam aadmi party ke kaaryakarta One of our companions is a big help in this fun
 vah saathi he sadak, jo hamen panaah dene ke liye apni sadakon par bade-bade gadhde bana detaa he, jisamen ham or hamaari saheli siver ke pani ko aaraam karne kaa bada mauka mil jaataa he
 Now these pits on the roads have become such that the road is barely visible
 ise thik karne ke liye khub dharna-pradarshan hue
 It turned out even in the newspapers, but no one can get enough of it to be made
 tippaniyan Recently, the Aam Aadmi Party was protesting by planting a lot of paddy in the same pit when the rainy water is full
 unki is buddhi par hamen taras aa rahaa tha ki ye koi dilli nahin he, jahaan unki sarkaar he
 Then where their government is there, they are not running, then this is the Parliamentary constituency of our Prime Minister
 yahaan bhala ye log hamaara kya kar paaenge

 These lines must have been written by the poet realizing the strange kashish flowing in the fijas of this city, in which any spiritual power It is realized, but it seems that the rulers of our day have understood the garbage like we are philosophers and that is why we are not able to remove it

 baavzood iske koi hamen apni jagah se hilaa nahin paata
 All that one can do is pick up from one place to fill the other place and we take this walk very happily because we know that for us, he has maintained the dumping plant, in which the operation of Karsara Dumping Plant It is at a standstill and the road to Ramna dumping plant is bad as well as the villagers will not let us come
 hamaara apana vajood hamaare apane shahar kii sankari galiyon main bhi khub faltaa-phulataa he, kyonki in galiyon main hamen (kooda) rakhane ke liye khaali jagah nahin milti
 So there is a problem in keeping the container as well
 or safaikarmi to bas khanaapurti karte hai
 In such a situation, i have to taunt with great fun
 haa, pichley saal kuch samay ke liye hamen pareshaani hui thi
 When the Etuz were picking us up from house to house and taking them away from our favorite city and streets
 tab thodi ghabrahat hui thi par man main ek nishcintata bhi thi ki ye sab zyaada din nahin chal paaegaa, kyonki ham jaanate the ki nagar nigam ke bhrasht adhikari, netaa, parshad paise ke chakkar main atuged kii aisi fajihat karenge ki vah bhaag khadaa hoga
 And the same thing happened
 ab har roj hamen hataane ke liye nai-nai scimen banati hai, paisa aata he or bant jaataa he
 On the other hand, officers and leaders are happy in the name of removing us and here we are happy to spread our empire on the streets
 aisa nahin ki hamen apane vajood par kabhi khatra mahasoos nahin hua
 When our MP became Prime Minister, he spoke about cleanliness in a big way
 banaras aae to khud jhaadoo bhi lagane lage
 Not only this, he also declared his cleaning Navratna here
 shuru main in navratnon main josh bhi dikhaa
 They also declared their own Navratna, a little scared in the mind, but on one hand there was certainty that the way these Navratnas were taking a little sweep and taking more photos, it was only then that they could remove us
 yah baat sach nikali
 Where is all these photobots today, nobody worries lihaaja, hamaara apana vajood har jagah kaayam he
 The benefit of the pm's parliamentary constituency is not only for us, but there is also plenty of water in our friend's sewer
 ham to ek jagah hi pade rahete hai
 From there we see the whole scene, but the pipe line is broken in place of our friend Sewer Rani, she goes out on the streets and then walks through the pipes of the water that is being supplied to the houses
 siver mili pani ko log pine ke liye majboor hai
 The interesting thing is that there is no one to stop it too, because the officials of the Jal Sansthan have sent a plan of crores of rupees to stop it and are waiting to see when this money will come in five to ten years
 tab tak isaki marammat ke naam par apni jholii bhar rahe hai
 Anyway, the sewer pipeline being laid under JNURM also does not make any sense, because the land for the STP that will take this pipeline to STP is not available yet
 lihaaja bhale hi iske liye karodon rupee aa gaye hon par ham logon kii mouj main koi khalal nahin daal saktaa
 Aam Aadmi Party workers growing paddy on the road hamaari is mouj main hamaare ek saathi kii badi madad he
 That fellow is the road, which makes big pits on our roads to give us shelter, in which we and our friends get a great chance to relax the sewer water
 ab to sadakon par ye gadhde aise ho gaye hai ki sadak bamushkil dikhti he
 There were many sit-ins to correct this
 akhabaaron main bhi niklaa par kisi kii itani taakat hi nahin ki ise banavaa sake
 The comments abhi haal hi main aam aadmi party vaale aise hi gadde main barsaat kaa pani bharaa hone par usamen dhan kaa behan ropakar virodh jataa rahe the
 We had pity on his intelligence that this is not Delhi, where his government is
 phir jahaan unki sarkaar he vahiin unki nahin chal rahi to ye to hamaare pradhanmantri ji kaa sansadeey kshetra he
 What will these people do here? ant main yahi kehane ko ji chahta he ki hamaari kaashi to shiv kii nagari he, yahaan kan-kan main shankar he
 Poets and poets have expressed its unique glory in their own style
 ek shaayar ne isi kadi main likhaa he ki " khak bhi jis jameen kaa paras he, wo shahar banaras he" in linon ko shaayar ne is shahar kii phijaaon main bah rahi us ajeeb-si kashish ko mahasoos kar likhaa hoga, jisame kisi ruhani taaqat kaa ahsaas hota he, par lagata he ki hamaare aaj ke hukmran ham jaise kooday ko hi paras samaj baithe hai isiilie hamen hataa nahin paa rahe
 Our own existence also thrives in the narrow streets of our own city, because in these streets we do not get free space to keep (garbage)
 lihaaja container rakhane main bhi fajihat he
 And the scavengers just do the cleaning
 aise main main bade maje se seenaa taane padaa hum

 vah saathi he sadak, jo hamen panaah dene ke liye apni sadakon par bade-bade gadhde bana detaa he, jisamen ham or hamaari saheli siver ke pani ko aaraam karne kaa bada mauka mil jaataa he
 Now these pits on the roads have become such that the road is barely visible
 ise thik karne ke liye khub dharna-pradarshan hue
 It turned out even in the newspapers, but no one can get enough of it to be made
 tippaniyan Recently, the Aam Aadmi Party was protesting by planting a lot of paddy in the same pit when the rainy water is full
 unki is buddhi par hamen taras aa rahaa tha ki ye koi dilli nahin he, jahaan unki sarkaar he
 Then where their government is there, they are not running, then this is the Parliamentary constituency of our Prime Minister
 yahaan bhala ye log hamaara kya kar paaenge
 In the end, it wants to say that our Kashi is the city of Shiva, here in every particle there is Shankar
 isaki isi niraali mahima ko kavi or shaayaron ne apane-apane andaaj main bayaan kiya he
 a poet has written in this episode that "the city that is owned by Paras is the city of Benaras"
 These lines must have been written by the poet realizing the strange kashish flowing in the fijas of this city, in which any spiritual power It is realized, but it seems that the rulers of our day have understood the garbage like we are philosophers and that is why we are not able to remove it
 aisa nahin ki hamen apane vajood par kabhi khatra mahasoos nahin hua
 When our MP became Prime Minister, he spoke about cleanliness in a big way
 banaras aae to khud jhaadoo bhi lagane lage
 Not only this, he also declared his cleaning Navratna here
 shuru main in navratnon main josh bhi dikhaa
 They also declared their own Navratna, a little scared in the mind, but on one hand there was certainty that the way these Navratnas were taking a little sweep and taking more photos, it was only then that they could remove us
 yah baat sach nikali
 Where is all these photobots today, nobody worries lihaaja, hamaara apana vajood har jagah kaayam he
 The benefit of the pm's parliamentary constituency is not only for us, but there is also plenty of water in our friend's sewer
 ham to ek jagah hi pade rahete hai
 From there we see the whole scene, but the pipe line is broken in place of our friend Sewer Rani, she goes out on the streets and then walks through the pipes of the water that is being supplied to the houses
 siver mili pani ko log pine ke liye majboor hai
 The interesting thing is that there is no one to stop it too, because the officials of the Jal Sansthan have sent a plan of crores of rupees to stop it and are waiting to see when this money will come in five to ten years
 tab tak isaki marammat ke naam par apni jholii bhar rahe hai
 Anyway, the sewer pipeline being laid under JNURM also does not make any sense, because the land for the STP that will take this pipeline to STP is not available yet
 lihaaja bhale hi iske liye karodon rupee aa gaye hon par ham logon kii mouj main koi khalal nahin daal saktaa
 Aam Aadmi Party workers growing paddy on the road hamaari is mouj main hamaare ek saathi kii badi madad he
 That fellow is the road, which makes big pits on our roads to give us shelter, in which we and our friends get a great chance to relax the sewer water
 ab to sadakon par ye gadhde aise ho gaye hai ki sadak bamushkil dikhti he
 There were many sit-ins to correct this
 akhabaaron main bhi niklaa par kisi kii itani taakat hi nahin ki ise banavaa sake
 The comments abhi haal hi main aam aadmi party vaale aise hi gadde main barsaat kaa pani bharaa hone par usamen dhan kaa behan ropakar virodh jataa rahe the
 We had pity on his intelligence that this is not Delhi, where his government is
 phir jahaan unki sarkaar he vahiin unki nahin chal rahi to ye to hamaare pradhanmantri ji kaa sansadeey kshetra he
 What will these people do here? ant main yahi kehane ko ji chahta he ki hamaari kaashi to shiv kii nagari he, yahaan kan-kan main shankar he
 Poets and poets have expressed its unique glory in their own style
 ek shaayar ne isi kadi main likhaa he ki " khak bhi jis jameen kaa paras he, wo shahar banaras he" in linon ko shaayar ne is shahar kii phijaaon main bah rahi us ajeeb-si kashish ko mahasoos kar likhaa hoga, jisame kisi ruhani taaqat kaa ahsaas hota he, par lagata he ki hamaare aaj ke hukmran ham jaise kooday ko hi paras samaj baithe hai isiilie hamen hataa nahin paa rahe

 chhattisgarh main swasthya vibhaag main gadabadi se judaa ek dilachasp vakya saamne aayaa he
 Indeed, a collector of Chhattisgarh stood in line for medicine
 jab vedava vitaranaki jagah pahunche, to maujuud para medical staff ne unhen teen tarah kii dawaaen baahar, yani kisi dukaan se kharidne kii salaah di
 The collector then rushed directly to the medical stores in Red Cross and reprimanded the officers after seeing the branded medicine
 dhamtari ke colector bhim singh ne ek marij kii parchi lee or marijon kii line main khadey ho gaye
 He arrived at the district hospital first, discussed with the patients, looked at the system and also saw the cleanliness
 unhen jab dawaai baahar se kharidte rahane kii shikaayat mili, to unhone ek marij se parchi le lee or line main khadey hokar apni baari kaa intjaar karne lage
 When his turn came, the complaint was corrected
 unki parchi dekhakar para medical stoff ne teen tarah kii dawaaon ko baahar ke medical stores se kharidne kii salaah di
 After this, the Collector showed great displeasure
 unhone karmchaariyon ko to danta hi, saath hi sidhe redcross ke medical stores pahunche or vahaan bhi branded dawa rakhaa dekhakar kaaphi naaraaz hue or jamkar fatkaar lagaai
 Significantly, the collector was neither identified by the hospital staff, nor the medical store staff
 bhim singh 2008 batch ke iees he
 Are native to Haryana and have become collectors for the first time
 dilli se sate gurugram main bekhof badmaashon ne BJP ke ek netaa par firing kar di
 The firing incident occurred at a petrol pump
 puraa vakya petrol pump par lage CCTV camere main kaid ho gai he
 Police have recovered CCTV footage and started identifying the miscreants
 police ke mutabik, gadoli ilaake ke petrol pump par us vaqt hadakamp much gaya jab 32 varshiya sandip apni fortuner gaadi main petrol pump par maujuud the
 After BJP leader Sandeep Diesel was getting the air checked in the tires of his car, three unidentified bike-ridden youths started firing indiscriminately at Sandeep sitting in the car
 isse pehle kii badmaash apane mansuubo main kaamyaab ho pate, sandip ne apni gaadi vahaan se bhaga lee
 He arrived at Medanta Hospital in Gurugram in an injured state and underwent treatment
 jaankaree ke mutabik, goli sandip kii ungaliyon ko chooti hui nikal gai
 But this firing in broad daylight created an atmosphere of panic in the area
 gauratlab he ki sandip gadoli gaanv ke hi rahane vaale hai or haal hi main sampannikaay chunaavamein bhaajapa ke ummidavaar rah chuke hai
 There are frequent cases of crime in Uttar Pradesh
 bekhauf badmaash hatya jaise maamalon ko anjaam dene se bhi nahin kataraa rahe hai
 In Lucknow, unscrupulous miscreants shot dead a young man working in an HCL company
 jisase yuvak kii maut ho gai
 On Tuesday, there was a stir on Campal Road in Thakurganj area of lucknow when unscrupulous miscreants shot a young man working in HCL company
 goli chalane kii aawaaj sunakar aas-paas ke logon main afra-tafari kaa maahaul ban gaya
 As soon as the information was received, local police and top officials also reached the spot
 ghayal avasthaa main yuvak ko trama centre pahunchaaya gaya, jahaan doctoron ne use mrit ghoshit kar diya
 In the initial investigation, the reason for the shot is said to be mutual rivalry
 jaankaree ke mutabik mritak sharad nigam thakurganj thana kshetra ke vanshi bihar colony aaazaad nagar main rahakar echsiel computers main naukari karata tha
 He was returning home from his job when the bike riding miscreants shot him
 goli uske kandhe ke paas lagi, jisase vah khun main lathpath hokar jameen par gir gaya
 On the information of the local people, along with the local police, police officers also reached the spot and inspected the scene and started investigation
 saath hi police ne shav ko kabje main lekar postmortem ke liye bhej diya he
 Along with the Crime Branch team, several other teams have been roped in to disclose the incident
 is maamle ko lekar aiji lakhanu es ke bhagat ne bataaya, 'sharad naam ke ek vyakti kii hatya kar di gai he
 He was about 28 to 30 years old
 vah apane ghar se 100 meter kii duuri par tha, tabhi peeche se do bike savaar log aae
 The boy sitting on the bike was wearing a black T-shirt and was wearing a helmet
 uske saath ek vyakti or tha, usne goli maari or vahaan se donon faraar ho gaye
 Prima facie the matter seems to be of mutual enmity

 In Uttar Pradesh, in the first assembly elections 'boys of UP' (akhilesh Yadav -rahul Gandhi) failed to stop Narendra Modi's Vijay Rath
 iske baad ab loksabhaa chunaav main buaa-bhatija (akhilesh-mayawati) kii jodi bhi puri tarah se naakaam hoti najar aa rahi he
 According to the Exit Poll of Aaj tak-axis My India, Narendra modi-amit Shah's pair looks very heavy on the SP-BSP-RLD alliance in Uttar Pradesh, the country's largest state
 dilachasp baat yah he ki mahaj ek agsit pole ko chhodkar sabhi survey main mahagathbandhan kii haar dikh rahi he
 Explain that forgetting the two decades old rivalry, BSP President Mayawati joined the Samajwadi Party and entered the electoral arena
 mana ja rahaa tha ki akhilesh-mayawati kii jodi narendra modi ke ashwamedh rath ko soobe main puri tarah se roak degaa, lekin saatven charan kii voting ke baad aae agsit pole main unke saare mansoobon par pani phirata dikh rahaa he
 In the exit poll of Aaj Tak- Axis My India, out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, BJP alliance is seen getting 62-68 seats
 jabaki sapa-basapa-areldi gathbandhan ko 10 se 16 siten or congress ko 1 se do siten milti hui dikh rahi he
 BJP alone is getting 60 to 66 seats and Apna Dal is getting 2 seats
 jabaki sapa ko 4 se 7 or basapa ko 3 se 7 siten mil rahi hai
 At the same time, Congress is getting one to two seats
 uttar pradesh main vot share ko dekhen to bijepi gathbandhan ko 48 fisadi vot mil rahaa he
 While the SP-BSP-RLD alliance is getting 39 percent of the vote
 vahiin, congress ko mahaj 8 fisadi or anya ko 5 fisadi mil rahaa he
 In this way, the equation of Dalit, Yadav and Muslim votes of SP-BSP does not seem to show any effect
 jabaki bijepi ke 50 fisadi vaale daawey sach hote najar aa rahe hai
 Result of the remaining exit poll for Uttar Pradesh NDA-60-62, Mahagathbandhan 17-19, Congress 1-2VMR- NDA 56, Mahagathbandhan 20, Congress 2 nilsen-nda 22, Alliance 56, Congress 2, tell that Akhilesh Yadav was elected in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 Combine with Res landed in the fray
 us vakt akhilesh or rahul gandhi kii jodi ko upi ke ladke kaa naaraa diya gaya tha
 But the people of the state had rejected the rahul-akhilesh pair in the elections

 aisa karne vaale vah duusare khilaadi bane hai
 Before him, only Yuvraj Singh did this in the World Cup, that too in the 2011 World Cup when India became the champion
 aise main shaakib ke parformens kii tulana ab tak ke sabase best oleround pradarshan ke saath hone lagi he
 Players with 50+ and 5 wickets (in World Cup) 2011: Yuvraj Singh vs Ireland (50 runs, 5 / 31) 2019: Shakib Al Hasan vs Afghanistan (51 runs, 5 / 29) Another Mahasayog Yuvraj Singh to win the World Cup
 And Shakib Al Hasan's record makes the world champion
 lekin ek or record aisa he jo bangladesh ke liye khushkhabari laa saktaa he
 In fact, in the history of the World Cup so far, there have been only three players who have scored a century in the tournament and also took five wickets in an innings

 Shakib Al Hasan is the first cricketer to take 400+ and 10+ wickets in World Cup

 Explain that Bangladesh is currently in the fifth position in the point table
 vah abhi tak 7 match main se 3 main jeet hasil kar chukaa he, abhi uske do match baaki hai
 In such a situation, Bangladesh have a chance that it can reach the semi-finals
 bangladesh ke abhi kul 7 points hai
 On the lines of prohibition in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan has announced that liquor shops built on the banks of Narmada River will be closed
 yah faisla madhyapradesh kii jeevanarekha maani jane vaali narmada ko saaf va aviral rakhane ke liye kiya gaya he
 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan these days is taking out Narmadaga service to revolve around Narmada
 yatra ke dauraan jab shivaraj singh chouhan hoshangabad pahunche to unhone elaan kiya ki narmada nadi ke 5 kimi
 All the liquor shops under the purview of the government will be closed, the decision has been approved by the Cabinet
 aabkaari vibhaag ke mutabik puure rajya main narmada nadi ke 5 kilometre ke daayre main aane vaali lagbhag 57 dukaane hai jinpar ye faisla lagu hoga
 Narmada passes through Mandla, Jabalpur, Narsinghpur, Hoshangabad, Harda, Khandwa, Dhar, Khargone districts from the origin of the Narmada to the Gujarat border
 haalanki ye faisla lenaa shivaraj singh chouhan ke liye aasaan nahin tha kyonki in dukaanon ke band hone se sarkari khajaane ko kareeb 100 karod rupye kaa nuksaan hona sambhavit he
 Will there be complete prohibition in Madhya Pradesh as well? With the announcement of closure of liquor shops along the Narmada side, this fragrance has started that after Gujarat and Bihar, will there be full prohibition in Madhya Pradesh too
 kyonki siem shivaraj ne saaf kaha he ki sirf narmada kinare kii dukaanon ko band hi nahin kiya jayega balki abhi sarkaar nashamukthi abhiyaan bhi chalaaegi taaki logon ko nashe kii aadat se dur kiya ja sake
 But the question arises whether the government will incur such a huge loss on its treasury because according to the figures, the government has earned more than Rs 7 thousand crore from the excise department last year

 saudi arab ke shah salmaan bin abdul ajij al saood ne mangalvaar ko ek shahi farmaan jari karte hue mahilaon ko desh main vaahan chalaane kii ijaajat de di he
 According to a report in the New York Times, the decision overturned the long-standing policy that had become a global symbol of the oppression of women in an extremist country
 yah nirnay haalanki, tatkaal lagu nahin kiya jayega kyonki desh main mahilaon ke liye driving seekhney yaa driving license praapt karne ke liye koi buniyadi dhaancha nahin he
 According to the report, the police will need to be trained to interact with women in a manner that rarely interacts between men and women unaware in this society
 kai varshon se saudi maulavee mahilaon ke driving karne par pratibandh lagane ke liye kai kaaran ginate rahe hai, jinamein se ek main daawa kiya jaataa rahaa he ki driving semhilaonke andashay ko nuksaan pahunchataa he

 At present, gold is trading at a 10-month low of Rs 27,185 per ten grams in the domestic market due to the strengthening dollar and a fall after the US Central Bank Federal Reserve raised interest rates
 haalanki desh main jahaan 2016 ke dauraan share bazaar ke pramukh index sensex ne 0
 Returned 5 percent, while the price of gold has gone up by 7 percent during this period
 yah oochaal 2016 ke shuruaati 6 maheenon ke dauraan teji se dekhne ko mili jab vaishvik sanketon se sone main nivesh ko surakshit mana ja rahaa tha
 But by the end of 2016, the price of gold is seeing a decline as investment demand decreases
 sone main jari giravat 2017 main jari rah sakati he
 Gold can be seen declining -1 due to these 4 reasons
 sona nahin he niveshak kii pehali pasand:nivesh ke lihaaj se sona hameshaa sadaa ke liye kaha jaataa tha
 That is, your money lying in it only increases and is the safest option of investment
 haalanki global iconomi main ho rahe pherbadal kaa sidhaa asar sone kii keemat par dikhaai de rahaa he
 In the early months of 2016, there was a good rise in gold prices, which was believed that the whole year would prove to be better for gold
 haalanki america arthvyavastha main majbootee ke mil rahe saaf sanketon ke baad duniyabar ke niveshak ab sone ke bajaae america bonds or share market main paisa laga rahe hai
 Due to this, the demand for investment in gold in the international market is constantly falling
 2
 Gold on the verge of demonetisation of brass: The ban on the currency of 500 and 1000 rupees in India with 86% circulation has a direct impact on the jewelers business in the country
 iske alaava desh main sone kii keemat international market ke hisaab se badhati-ghatati he
 Continuing fall in gold prices in the international market by the end of 2016 has also affected the Indian market
 vahiin notebandi ke baad desh main benami sampatti or kaledhan ke khilaaf badi muhim ke khatre se bhi desh main sone main nivesh karne se log kataraa rahe hai
 Therefore, it is believed that a strong American economy will keep gold prices down in 2017
 vahiin notebandi ke baad desh main nai muhim ke chalate bharat main bhi niveshkon kii demand kamjor rahegi
 As such, the fall in gold prices in 2017 is expected to continue
 3
 Gold prices fall due to Trump rally: Since demonetisation, the rupee has continued to fall against the dollar in the international currency market
 dollar ke mukaable rupee kii keemat 69 rupee prati dollar ke str par pahunch chuki he
 At the same time, the dollar has steadily risen to a 14-year high since Donald Trump won the election in 2016
 iskaa sidhaa asar sone kii keemat par pad rahaa he
 As the dollar will strengthen, gold prices will continue to fall
 gauratlab he ki america kendriya bank fedral rigerv ne haal hi main byaaj daron main ijapha kiya tha
 Experts believe that during 2017, the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates at least three more times
 is faisle se america main sone ke bajaae bankig instrument main nivesh badhegaa or sona kii lokapriyata kam hoti rahegi
 4
 1 janvari se lagu hoga holmarking kaa nayaa niyam:jewelery holmarking kaa nayaa kanoondesh main 1 janvari se lagu ho jayega
 According to the new law, only 22, 18 and 14 carat gold jewelery can be hallmarked from January 1 in the country
 abhi tak bhartiya bazaar main kul 10 category ke sone kii holmarking kii jaati he
 At the same time, the law, which came into force on January 1, will also start hallmarking the gold coins, biscuits and bricks in the country
 sarkaar ke is kadam kaa sidhaa asar desh main jewelery ke kaarobaar par padegaa
 After the Hallmarking Act, there will be great transparency in the process of buying large amounts of gold in the country and investing in gold
 is paardarshita kii vajah se log holmarking jewelery or gold main blikemani ko nivesh karne se bachenge
 Congress leader Digvijay Singh criticized Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi's statement that he is a Hindu nationalist and said that Modi should not divide the country on the basis of religion
 modi ke bayaan se siyaasi halchal machane ke ek din baad digvijay singh ne twitor par kaha, kya hamen hindu rashtravaadi yaa muslim rashtravaadi yaa sikh rashtravaadi yaa isaai rashtravaadi hone kii bajaay rashtravaadi bhartiya nahin hona chahie? In another tweet, he targeted the Sangh Parivar and said, do not divide this great nation on the basis of religion like Savarkar and Jinnah
 ve donon do raashtra ke siddhant ke janak the
 In another tweet condemning all forms of fundamentalism, Digvijay said that he heard Malala Yousafai of Pakistan addressing the United Nations
 ladakiyon ko shikshit kiye jane kii samarthak malala ko talibaniyon ne goli maar di thi, lekin use bachaa liya gaya tha
 Praising the 16-year-old Malala, Digvijay said, he strongly criticized the Taliban and all forms of fundamentalism
 vah vaishvik sakshartaa kii pratik ban gai he
 Congratulations to him aao ham sabhi us baat ke liye ladane kaa sankalp len, jiske liye vah khadi hui he
 May God give him long life and strength
 tippaniyan Digvijay has tweeted at a time when Modi tried to defend himself against allegations of not taking any steps to control the 2002 riots in Gujarat
 modi ne ek saakshaatkaar main kaha tha, yadi main car kii peeche kii seat par baitha hum or ek chota kute kaa baccha car ke pahiyon ke neeche aa jaataa he, to kya yah dukhad nahin he? nishchit rup se yah dukhad hoga
 Whether i am Chief Minister or not, i am a human being
 yadi kahin kuch bura hota he, to mujhe dukh hoga
 Modi said that he took the right steps during the 2002 riots and his government used its full force to correct the situation
 modi ne kaha tha, main rashtravaadi hum
 i am a patriot
 isamen kuch bhi galat nahin he
 i was born in a Hindu family
 isamen kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Therefore, i am a Hindu nationalist
 to haa, aap kah sakate hai ki main ek hindu rashtravaadi hum, kyonki main janm se ek hindu hum
 a day after Modi's statement created a political stir, Digvijay Singh said on Twitter, should we not be a nationalist Indian instead of being a Hindu nationalist or Muslim nationalist or Sikh nationalist or Christian nationalist? unhone ek anya twit main sangh parivaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, is mahaan raashtra ko saavarkar or jinna kii tarah dharm ke aadhaar par na baanten
 Both of them were the father of the principle of two nations
 digvijay ne har prakaar ke kattarwad kii ninda karte hue ek anya twit main kaha ki unhone pakistan kii malala yusufai ko sanyukt raashtra ko sambodhit karte suna
 Malala, a supporter of educating girls, was shot by Taliban, but was saved
 digvijay ne 16-varshiya malala kii prashansa karte hue kaha, usne taliban or har prakaar ke kattarwad kii joardaar tareeke se aalochana kii
 She has become a symbol of global literacy
 use badhai ho
 Let us all resolve to fight for what she has stood for
 ishwar use lambii aayu or takat de
 The comments digvijay ne aise samay par twit kiya he, jab modi ne gujarat main 2002 main hue dangon par kaabo paane ke liye koi kadam na uthaane ke aaropon ke khilaaf khud kaa bachaav karne kii koshish kii thi
 Modi said in an interview, "if i am sitting in the back seat of a car and a little puppy falls under the wheels of the car, isn't it sad?" Surely it will be sad
 main bhale hi mukhyamantri hum yaa nahin hum, main ek insaan hum
 If something bad happens, i will be sad
 modi ne kaha ki unhone 2002 ke dangon ke dauraan bilkul sahi kadam uthaae or unki sarkaar ne halaat thik karne ke liye apni puri takat kaa istemaal kiya
 Modi had said, i am a nationalist
 main deshbhakt hum
 There is nothing wrong in this
 maine hindu parivaar main janm liya he
 There is nothing wrong in this

 In the last one year, the Municipal Corporation has received more than 21,000 complaints

 How many complaints were received? North MCD has - 10,248 complaints with South MCD - 7,388 complaints with East MCD - 3,882 complaints are being handled by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi

 Kamaljeet says that according to the law we have to leave the dogs back after sterilization from where we catch dogs
 bandaron ko lekar supreme court kaa order he ki ye junglee jaanavar hai
 In such a situation, this work is done by the Delhi government, but the corporation is doing this work

 aise main nigam vah bhi nahin kar paa rahi he
 At the same time, Congress party leader Mukesh Goyal strongly targeted the MCD and Arvind Kejriwal government for not having dog bite medicines in the hospital
 shunya rahaa nateezamukesh goyal ne kaha he ki beete 15 varshon se dilli nagar nigam kii satta main bijepi kabiz he
 In such a situation, crores of rupees were spent in catching these stray animals, but the result was zero
 vahiin bijepi netaa kamaljit ne kute kaatane ke ilaaj ke liye dilli main dawaaen na milane par kejariwal sarkaar ko jamkar kosa
 When it came to municipal hospitals, it cited lack of funds

 Naxalites have laid landmines for many years in the need of local people for security forces

 Therefore, the police and CRPF personnel need local people to run their operations here

 One of those doctors was Dr
 Chandrasekhar Yadav
 unke paas 500 kilo se zyada ke surgery ke upkaran the

e
 Kargil, who could not perform knee operation after coming to Delhi by flight
 mujhe is tarah ke garib marijon ko dekhakar ye ehsaas hua ki hamaare desh main doordaraj ke garib marijon ko aise doctoron kii sakht jarurat he, lekin kya hamaare doctor taiyaar he
 Even if doctors like Dr
 Yadav are ready, are there local influential people like Lama Lobjang who can at least provide clean living arrangements for these doctors? khayr pehle din se mere saath ai doctoron kii team marijon ko dekhne jute gai
 Dr
 CS Yadav gathered all the surgery items and visited the operation theater of Leh District Hospital

 main apane cameraman ke saath apane kamare main chalaa gaya
 But in the middle of the night, high altitude sickness showed its effect and we started having complaints like vomiting, dizziness
 hamaari tabiyat bighad gai phir ehsaas hua ki kyon log leh aane ke baad oxigen kii kami kaa shikaar ho jate hai
 There were some people who came with Dr
 Yadav, the victim of this sickness, due to which once it was felt that surgery would not be possible on the second day
 lekin dow yadav kii jid or unke saath aae saathiyon kaa hausala tha ki ek ke baad ek safal surgery hoti rahi
 After finishing work in the evening, when Dr
 CS Yadav used to say to me that Ravish is the greatest happiness in this world, when my work brings happiness on the face of another
 teen din tak surgery karne ke baad chauthe din dow sies yadav khud biimaar pad gaye
 Just two years after this, Dr
 Chandrasekhar got a call one day and he was very happy and told that the operation done in Leh was probably the highest surgery done at the highest height, due to which he has been included in the Limca Book of Records
