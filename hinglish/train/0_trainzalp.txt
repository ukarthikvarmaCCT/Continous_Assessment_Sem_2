 Actress Kangana Ranot, who has become the shining star of Bollywood, has started promoting her upcoming film 'tanu Weds Manu Returns'
 film tanu vaids manu riterns 22 may ko relies hone ja rahi he
 Here are some excerpts from a conversation i had with Kangana about this film: What was the reason that made you say this film? a love story was shown in the film Tanu Weds Manu released earlier
 jahaan do alag-alag tarah ke log ek saath rahane ko taiyaar ho jate hai lekin is baar chaar saal ke baad unke or parivaar ke bich kya-kya ghatnaayen hoti hai, usee ko lekar'tanu vaids manu riterns'kii kahani buni gai he
 When Anand L
 Rai told me the story, i was lost and i liked it
 main is film kaa hissaa ban gai
 The story of this film is quite different
 is film main dabl role adaa kiya he iske liye kaaphi homework bhi kiya hoga?main apane kirdaar kii teen alag-alag level par taiyaari karti hum
 One is physically, second mentally and third what will be the attitude of that character
 to is tarah se maine donon kirdaaron par kaam kiya
 The use of Haryanvi language has also been seen in your 'datto' character, what was the preparation for it? My teacher Sunita ji helped me a lot in learning to speak Haryanvi
 is tarah se main unki or khud kii mehnat se hi yah kar pai
 How much do you believe in a sequel? i did not want to do a sequel, i find the word sequel quite strange, Vikas came out for 'queen 2' and i said i don't have to listen to the story, why the thing that has happened Tease should go ahead, but when i heard the story of Anand Rai, i realized that this film is different
 vaise agar mujhe opshan mili to main hameshaa fresh film hi karun
 Kangana, do you see her image in the role of 'datto' or 'tanu'? (laughs) You will only know when the story will be built on Kangana's life
 filmein dekhati hai aap? aakhri film koun si dekhi?bilkul main filmein dekhati hum
 The last film i have seen is 'piku', 'bombay Velvet'
 safalataa kaa mantra kya he?bas lage raho, ghar par baithe nahin rah sakate naa
 Had gone to the National Award for the second time, what was the experience like? There were so many protocols for the first time, there was also fear

 16 somvaar vrath se bhagwaan shiv ko prasann kiya jaataa he
 Lord Shankar is called Mahadev, the God of Gods, therefore worshiping them can be found as desired
 vaise to yah vrath koi bhi kar saktaa he, phir bhi kunvaari kanyaayein vishesh rup se is vrath ko vidhi-vidhaan se karke manachaaha var paa sakati hai
 How to worship Shiva: Monday's fast is started from the first date of Shukla Paksha of the month of Shravan, Chaitra, Vaisakh, Karthik and Margashirsha
 isesolah somvaartak puri shraddha se rakhane se manabhaavan falon kii prapti hoti he
 The fasting person should wake up before sunrise and take some black sesame water
 bhagwaan shiv kaa abhishek jal yaa gangaajal se hota he, parantu vishesh avasar va vishesh manokamanaayon kii purti ke liye doodh, dahi, ghi, shahad, chane kii daal, sarson tel, kaale til, aadi kai samagriyon se abhishek kii vidhi prachilat he
 After this, Lord Shiva and Parvati should be worshiped with white flowers, white sandalwood, rice, panchamrit, betel nut, fruits and Ganga water or clear water through the mantra 'un Namah Shivaya'
 manyata he ki abhishek ke dauraan pujan vidhi ke saath-saath mantron kaa jaap bhi behad aavashyak mana gaya he, phir mahamrityunjay mantra kaa jaap ho,gayatri mantra ho yaa phir bhagwaan shiv kaa panchakshari mantra
 After worshiping shiva-parvati, do the fasting story of Monday
 aarti karne ke baad bhoga lagaaein or ghar parivaar main baantne ke baad swayan grahan karen
 Eat salt-free food only once a day
 somvaar vrath kii katha:'shiv mahapurana' ke anusaar, jab mata parvati or shiv agastya muni se katha sunakar kar laut rahe the, usee dauraan bholenath ne dekha ki unke aradhy dev bhagwaan ram mata sita ke viyog main bhatak rahe hai
 After seeing him, Shiva bowed to him, but Mata Parvati had the idea of taking Ram's test
 bholenath se aagrah kar ve prabhu ram kii pariksha lene pahunchin, lekin parvati ko dekhte hi bhagwaan ram ne parvati ko mata kaa sambodhan dete hue kaha, aap yahaan, bholenath kahaan hai?vahiin bhagwaan dwaara pahachaane jane or mata shabd ke sambodhan ko chhipate hue parvati ne shiv se jhooth kaa sahaara liya
 Parvati said that Lord Rama did not recognize her
 iske baad dhyaan karne par jab bhagwaan shiv ko pataa chalaa ki ram ne unhen mata se sambodhit kiya he, to unhone parvati kaa tyaag kar diya
 One of the reasons for Parvati's renunciation was that Rama called Parvati a mother, so she gave up the mother of her adorable god as wife
 isse yahi andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki bhagwaan shiv apane bhakton ke liye kuch bhi kar sakate hai

 The court closed the police files by erasing the stains of robberies from his past, but Renu's nomadic life-style continues
 kanpur ke kalyanpur ilaake kii ek basti main apane chachaa shivsingh yadav ke saath rahane vaali renu kisi athlete se kam nahin dikhti
 Blue jeans, white shirt and sports shoes in the feet, 5 feet 8 inches in height and red tika on the forehead
 uski ankhon main aaj bhi vah manjar tair jaataa he, jisane uski jindagi ko sire se badal diya
 Renu, the eldest of the five children of Vidyaram Yadav living in village Jamalipur in Auraiya district, was brilliant from the beginning
 29 november, 2003 ko ghar se skool jate vakt durdaant daaku chandan yadav ne uskaa apharan kar liya or uske pita se 10 lakh ru
 Asked for a ransom par mahaj 5-6 bighas jameen main kisaani karke apana parivaar chalaane vaale vidyaram ke liye itani badi rakam jutanaa sambhav na tha
 They kept going round the police officers
 phiroti kii rakam na milane par chandan ne renu ko pratadit karnaa shuru kar diya
 "after the kidnapping, i was kept tied for two weeks," Renu says
 khaanaa itnaa hi diya ki saans chalati rahe
 a few days later, Chandan Yadav declared me the bandit beauty of his gang
 haathon main bandook thama di
 i had no choice but to obey him
 chandan gang kii har vaardaat ke dauraan mujhe apana naam lekar logon ko daraana padataa tha
 After this, Dasu Sundari Renu was also named as accused in 17 incidents of murder, robbery, kidnapping, robbery in the forests of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh
 silsilaa 4 janvari, 2005 tak chalaa
 Ramveer Gurjar and Chandan, who had declared themselves as bandit emperors, had a gang war this night, in which Chandan was killed
 ramvir ne renu ko bandhak bana liya
 But his rule did not last too long in the rugged
 15 janvari, 2005 kii raat jab giroh ke duusare sadsy aaraam kar rahe the, ramvir ne badaniyati se renu par hamalaa kar diya
 In the middle of the snarl, his hand got SLR and he removed all the bullets in Ramvir's chest
 ghaney behad main saat din tak bhatakane ke baad vah apane ghar pahunchi
 The attitude of the police was no less frightening with Renu, who had escaped from the clutches of the bandits
 14 farvari, 2005 ko itawa ke tatkaaleen esaspi dalajit choudhary, kotwali prabharee ke saath renu ke ghar pahunche or suraksha kaa bharosa dekar kotwali le aae
 On reaching there, he was arrested and all the 17 cases filed against Chandan Yadav in several districts including Jalaun, Etawah, Kanpur Dehat were imposed on Renu
 vah ab salaakhon ke peeche thi or use kanoon kii jang ladgai thi
 Daljit Chaudhary is now posted in Delhi on deputation
 apane upar lagaae ja rahe aaropon par ve koi bhi tippanee karne se inkaar karte hai
 On the other hand, Shiv Singh, uncle of Renu, a former Air Force soldier and District Panchayat member of Ramabai Nagar, supported his niece in a legal battle
 adaalat ne sabhi 17 mukademon se renu ko bari kar diya
 The court considered the police action in this case extremely irresponsible and reprimanded her
 saat varsh tak chali adalati ladaai jeetne ke baad renu isi saal 29 may ko lakhanu ke nari bandi niketan se reeha hui
 Now he is free
 lekin behad ne uskaa peechha abhi tak nahin choda he
 Badly wounded at the hands of Renu, the robber Ramvir Gurjar felt good in surrendering to the Madhya Pradesh government with his brother Arvind Gurjar on increasing physical discomfort
 magar behad main maujuud uske giroh ke sadsy ab renu par gang kii kaman sanbhaalane ko dabaav daal rahe hai or aisa na karne par jaan se maarane kii dhamkee de rahe hai
 Renu made a written complaint to the Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav in Janta Darshan and also requested for security
 renu kii jindagi kaa safar kaaphi utaar-chadhaav bharaa rahaa he, lekin vah apni jang yaheen khatm nahin karnaa chaahati
 Her dream now is to work for oppressed, tortured women

 On the question of changing the names of cities, 100-150 new cities should be built, Javed Akhtar said - now somehow cities should be made smart, change the name itself
 mahatvapurn baat yah he, jis par koi gaur nahin kar rahaa he ki is desh main kam se kam 100-150 nae shahar banane chahie
 Today, migration from villages to cities is on a large scale

 Similarly, there are one or two cities in the South

 ) Expressing concern over the commercialization of the profession of advocacy, the Supreme Court has said that it has become so expensive to fight a legal battle in the court that it is out of reach of the poor man
 sheersh adaalat ke anusaar nyaayik prakriya itani dhimi he ki log ab is baat se aashwast ho gayi hai ki mukadmaa unke jeevankaal main khatm nahin hoga
 a division bench of Justice BS Chauhan and Justice SA Bobde said that advocacy was once known as an elite profession but in the current era this profession has turned into a professional assurance
 mukadmaa ladanaa itnaa manhagaa ho gaya he ki ek garib aadmi kii pahunch se yah dur ho chukaa he
 The judges said that lawyers have equal involvement with the judges in the administration of justice and lawyers cannot conduct themselves like suspects or just living with the help of lawsuits
 court ne kaha ki kanoon vyapaar nahin he
 a lawyer is an officer of the court and hence it is his duty to ensure the functioning of the court in a smooth manner
 vakil ko sankat main ghire vyakti kii ummide jagaani hoti hai or vah asahaay vaadi kaa shoshan nahin kar saktaa he
 The apex court also commented adversely on activities such as prolonging the trial and taking the services of other lawyers for debate and said that it was like trapping the plaintiff which is not morally and professionally sound

 For this, the apex court takes the test
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki edwocket on ricard ‘atithi kalakaar’ nahin he jo yachika par sirf hastakshar karata he
 The court said that this kind of attitude is very cruel towards innocent people and such conduct of Advocate on Record is not in conformity with Advocate on Record

 Shivpal Yadav has openly challenged former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, saying that Akhilesh should hand over the party to Mulayam by July 5 or else he will form a 'samajwadi Secular Front' on July 6
 party se naaraaz chal rahe shivpal yadav ne buudhvaar ko akhilesh yadav ke khilaaf morcha khol diya
 a formal conversation with journalists clearly stated that if Akhilesh Yadav has any morality left and if he is supportive of saving the party, then be ready to look for alternatives if he does not forward Netaji by 5 July and hand over the command of the party to him
 shivpal yadav akhilesh ke khilaaf yaheen nahin ruke
 He advised that there is still time to improve, if reformed, the party will survive and the socialists will reunite, but if they do not improve now and remain trapped in the clutches of sycophants and brokers, they have no other than to form a secular front There will be more options
 shivpal yadav ne kaha ki mulaayam singh yadav is secular morche kii aguwai karenge or vah sanyojak honge
 At present, a front will be formed within the party, under which all socialists will try to unite, Mulayam Singh Yadav himself will take charge of it and all the scattered socialists will come under this secular front
 shivpal yadavane kaha ki akhilesh yadav ne haar kar bhi koi sabak nahin siikhaa he
 If they disassociate themselves from the sycophants and brokers and unite themselves with the socialists, then the party can become one again
 shivpal ne kaha ki bina mulaayam singh ke koi samaajawaadee party yaa gathbandhan nahin ho saktaa
 In such a situation, there is a need to take the leadership of the leader, my talk is, then i will stand behind me if even today both are united
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki agar pariwarik ho jaae to party ko ek hone main vakt nahin lagegaa

 unhone kaha abhi 6 maheene is sarkaar ko diya janaa chahie
 But he definitely praised that the will power is visible in the yogi and he wants to do something different, in such a time, it is necessary to give time

 What would you think? What would they think? What will the world think? Rising from it, some thinking, life will be another name for comfort
 "if you are afraid to do something, then remembering this is a sign that your work is really full of bravery
 The smell of clothes is not a big deal, fun

 Pakistani media reports said on Wednesday that air strikes were also carried out in several other areas, including Mir Ali and Boya, according to Xinhua
 aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf chalaae gaye is abhiyaan main kai pramukh aatankwaadi maare gaye
 Religion is considered a means of peace and salvation
 yahi vajah he ki log dharm kii ore aakrisht hote hai, lekin kuch dhongi baabaaon kii vajah se aaj dharm ke prati logon kii aasthaa kam or dharm ke saadhakon ke prati kamjor hoti ja rahi he
 But the biggest question here is what are the reasons that people get caught in the clutches of such babas
 unako bhagwaan maanane lagate hai
 Go crazy after them
 yadi aisa nahin hota, to rape cese main fanse ram rahim jaise baabaaon ke liye lakhon log tandav nahin karte
 These are the hypocritical art of modern babas
 
 
 1- swang rachane kii kalasant asaram se lekar radhe maa tak kathith dhongi santon kii sabase badi kala swang rachane kii he
 Swang means a character who plays himself by shifting himself to another character
 asaram or radhe maa kii body language par baarik najar daalen, to yah swang saaf-saaf najar aata he
 Pretender saints represent themselves as Gods
 bhagwaan kii kaalpanik mudra or bhav-bhangimaayein banane kii koshish karte hai
 Since childhood, we save the God appearing in tv-serials or posters in our mind easily
 aise main jab ye dhongi baba unki tarah swang rachaate hai, to hamen lagata he ki ve bhagwaan hai
 We are attracted towards them
 unhen bhagwaan maanakar puja karne lagate hai
 Taking advantage of this, saints like Ichchadhari Baba and Asaram exploit people
 zyaadaatar mahilaayein inaki shikaar banati hai
 2- The ability to talk and to talk is because of the eloquence of people like the so-called saints Rampal and Asaram , innocent people easily get into his words
 unke andar baat banane kii wo kala hoti he, jo logon ko sammohit kar leti he
 After this, every thing of his seems correct
 apni baton main fansaakar ye dhongi baba logon ko bargalane lagate hai
 They make various excuses and make money from them
 unki baton main fansi janata ko iskaa abhas bahut der se hota he
 3- Attractive and different types of cladding: It is often seen in the case of Baba Baba that they occur in an attractive cladding
 udhaaharan ke liye ichhadhari baba bheemanand, radhe maa, swami nityanand or nirmal baba ke kapadon or rahan-sahan par gaur kiijie
 They wear out of the ordinary clothes
 inke baithne ke asana, kapadon kaa style, baithne kaa tarika, manch kii saaj-sajja anokhi hoti he, jo logon ko apni taraf aakarshith karti he
 4- The art of taking advantage of weakness Baba knows the art of taking advantage of the weaknesses of people and religion
 unhen pataa hota he ki log kii kamajoriyaan kya hai
 They connect him with religion
 logon ko bhanak bhi nahin lagati ki aasthaa ke naam par unke saath khel ho rahaa he
 Poor and illiterate people are targeted at such fake saints
 kuch amir apane kaale dhan ko safed karne ke liye hi unki sharan main jate hai
 5- Branding and marketing art Branding and marketing is considered to be the greatest art in this era
 dhongi baabaaon kaa ye sabase bada aujaar hota he
 These people promote themselves with their own money through TV, newspaper and social media
 khud ko bhagwaan kaa avatar bataate hue, logon kii sabhi pareshaaniyaan dur karne kaa daawa karte hai
 People entangled in their misery get easily into their travesty
 kuch trick kii vajah se inako bhagwaan maanane lagati he
 It is said that no matter how powerful a lie is, it is definitely exposed
 ji haa, iske sabase bade udhaaharan kathithsant ram rahim,asaram, ichhadhari baba bheemanand, nirmal baba, rampal or radhe maa hai
 He has been exposed to their truth only lately
 haa, isse aahat hui he, to logon kii aasthaa
 If affected, the feeling of religion

 Look at your 2012 manifesto

 If he had honesty in his heart, this bill would have come 3-4 years ago

 The Defense Ministry has ordered closure of 39 military farms in the country, after which many questions are being raised on this decision
 kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar ne jin farm ko band karne kaa aadesh diya he usamen desh kii sabase acchhee nasl kii gaay maujuud hai
 There are about 20 thousand cows in these 39 farms, while around 2500 employees work here
 sarkaar ke is faisle ke baad inaki naukari par bhi sidhe taur par asar padegaa
 Let me tell you that the cabinet committee had issued an order to the army last month and asked them to close these gaushalas within 3 months
 da telegraph main chhapi khabar ke anusaar, sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki chunki desh main ab privet deyari yaa doodh kaa kaarobaar itnaa bada ho gaya he ki sena ko khud kii farm kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 The army can now be provided milk through those private dairies
 yani bhartiya sena ke jawan ab packet vaala doodh pienge
 Therefore, the army can supply milk through dairy
 haalia daur main sena main goshaala ke bhrashtachar ko lekar kai maamle saamne aae the
 This decision is also being linked to that
 sarkaar ke is faisle se jin 39 fermon par fark padegaa unamem meerut, jhaansi, kanpur, ambala samet kai bade shaharon kii farm hai
 On this decision of the government, scientists of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) say that they are confused about what will happen to these 20,000 cows after the farm is closed
 vaigyanikon kaa kahana he ki desh main kisi or farm ke paas itani kshamta nahin he ki vah 2 xxrep 4 0 gaayon kaa paalan-poshan kar sake
 It is important to note that there has been a lot of discussion around the country for some time

 'muslimon kii deshbhakti par sawaal kyon?'ovaisi ne haal hi main bhartiya muslimon ko pakistani kehane waalon ko teen saal kii jail kii sajaa dene kii maang bhi kii thi
 He said why now the so-called nationalists are silent on the sacrifice of five Muslims

 Owaisi said that a pregnant Muslim woman was also shot

 'lessons notwithstanding many terror attacks', Owaisi has said that the army camp at Sunjawan was also attacked in 2003
 tab bhi isi raste kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 The terrorists entered the camp through a drain
 uri, pathankot yaa nagarota main aatanki hamalon ke baavjood koi sabak nahin liya gaya
 He questioned who will take responsibility for these attacks, is it not the failure of the IB? 'modi will then eat' Biryani ', he also said on Jammu and Kashmir CM Mehbooba Mufti's statement that "talks should happen with Pakistan" Prime Minister Narendra Modi was targeted
 unhone kaha ki piem modi se poocha janaa chahie ki pakistan ke saath kya sambandh rakhane hai
 He jokingly said, 'don't know when Modi will reach Pakistan without calling again at whose wedding and they will eat' biryani '
 '7 mein se 5 log jo maare gaye woh Kashmiri Musalmaan the
 Ab ispe kuch kyun nahi bola ja raha hai
 Isse sabak haasil karna pdega unn logon ko jo musalmaanon ki wafadari pe shak karte hain, jo unko aaj bhi Pakistani keh rahe hain

 In this case, the state with the largest population Uttar Pradesh is at the fifth position
 dipiiiti ne uttar pradesh ke 4328 starop ko manyata di he
 The special thing is that this time about the 'start-up India' campaign of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, there is not much effect in Gujarat because only 2693 startups have been registered this time from their home state Gujarat

 noscom kii report kahati he ki start-ap main nivesh lagbhag doguna ho gaya he
 In 2017, where $ 2 billion was invested in startups, it increased to 4 in 2018

 From this it can be inferred that increasing the investment improves the startup's chances of progressing

 The government is trying to take the start-up even further and for this many types of discounts are also being given
 haalanki is bajet se starop companiyon ke liye kai or tarah kii raahat ko ummiden thim jo nahin milin
 Despite this, in some states where the startup looks very successful, there is a lack of activism in many states

 bharat chaar maichon kii shrunkhlaa main 3-0 se aage chal rahaa he or uske paas apane 81 saal ke test itihaas main series ke sabhi chaar match jeetne kaa sunaharaa avasar he
 If Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team succeeds in doing so, it will be a 'jaise ko tit' answer for Australia, as Australia beat India in all four matches in their home series last year
 tippaniyan 'spinner' is just a four-letter word, but it has made the biggest difference between the two teams in the current series
 australian ballebaajon ke paas bhartiya spinneron kaa koi jawaab nahin mil paaya he
 In contrast, there is no arrow in the quiver of Australian spinners that can trouble the Indian batsmen

 Although the Australian batsmen are claiming that they are close to getting out of the spin of the spin, but if the Kotla pitch does not change its ancestral mood, then the cricket fans will be forced to bowl to the Australian batsmen on the balls of Ravichandran Ashwin, Pragyan Ojha and Ravindra Jadeja
 Only Bush dance will be seen

 UPSC Civil Services Exam 2017 kii taarikh najadik aa rahi he
 Candidates now have only a few hours left to prepare
 aise main jaruri he ki aap is aakhri vakt kaa upyog revijan ke liye karen
 Lakhs of students take the exam to become UPSC Civil Services Exam
 par safal bas kuch hi ho pate hai
 Why so? The reason behind this is their mistakes
 UPSC IAS Exam 2015 crek karne ke 8 tipsoufshchh Civil Services Exam main hissaa lene vaale parikshaarthi aamtaur par ye 10 galtiyaan karte hai, jo unki safalataa ke bich pahaad ban kar khadi ho jaati he

 agar aap ye sochate hai ki UPSC Civil Services Exam ke liye unlimited padhai kerani hoti he or wo CSE salebus se zyada taiyaari main lag jate hai
 Due to this, their time is also destroyed and the preparation is also not complete
 5 saal main kitna badal gaya IAS exam, jaaniye
 
 
 2
 beete saal ke question papers ko na dekhnaa bhi ek badi galati he
 The exam pattern and questions can be estimated from the previous years or previous years' question papers
 3
 The more books, the more confusion
 is baat ko samajhen
 It is not necessary to have correct information in every book found in the market
 kuch chaatr khub sari kitaaben kharidne or padhane kii galati kar baithte hai
 It would be better if you buy a few selected books and study from them
 IAS exam main puche gaye aise sawaal, jinhen padhakar chakra jaaenge aap
 
 
 4
 NCERT kitabon ko nazarandaaj karnaa sabase badi galatiyon main se ek he
 If you do not read the NCERT books for preparation, then you should assume that you will not be successful in the IAS exam
 IAS bananaa chaahate hai, to aise karen taiyaari5
 The success of IAS also depends on how you have managed the time for preparation
 samay kii ranneeti aapaki kuch aisi honi chahie, jisamen taiyaari ke baad revijan kaa bhi paryaapt vakt bache
 But most of the students are busy preparing till the exam day
 unke paas revijan ke liye vakt hi nahin bachataa

 An incident embarrassing the mother-daughter relationship has surfaced in South Yorkshire, USA
 jise sunakar har maa kaa sir shame se jhuk jayega

 a woman lived with her 12-year-old baby boy in Yorkshire
 is dauraan ek soshal site par mahila kii dosti ek yuvak ke saath ho gai
 Then friendship turned into love and the two started living together
 mahila kii 12 varshiya beti bhi saath thi
 But the woman had a desire to become a mother again, but for some reason she was unable to conceive
 is bich us mahila ke dimag main ek khaufnak idia aayaa
 He planned to make his 12-year-old girl a surrogate mother
 jiske chalate usne apane bwoyfriend ko apni maasoom beti ke sathrepakarne ke liye kaha
 Both of them continued to sexually abuse the girl for several days
 nateeja ye hua ki bacchee garbhvatee ho gai
 The child used to complain to the stepfather of his mother, but the woman kept encouraging him to become a mother
 kuch din baad peedit bacchee ke dada-daadi ko bacchee kii haalat dekhakar kuch shaq hua
 By the time the matter was opened before him, it was too late

 The Shiv Sena has once again targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi through an editorial published in its mouthpiece 'saamana' , and this time the issue is Pakistani firing in violation of ceasefire along the border
 'saamana' ne sampadakeey main likhaa he, narendra modi ji, maharashtra kii raajnneeti baad main bhi kii ja sakati he, lekin abhi pakistan ko jawaab dene kaa vakt he
 Will we only count the dead of our countrymen? unhone hamaare paanch maare hai, unke 50 markar mundamala ke saath maharashtra aaie

 Whether the 56-inch chest is needed to protect the country, and to teach Pakistan a lesson, is a matter of dispute, but it is not necessary to measure chest width if one wishes to fight, the editorial reads
 kuch hi samay pehle tak rajya main bijepi ke saath gathbandhan banaakar chal rahi shivasena ke mukhpatr main prakashit is aalekh main kaha gaya he, iske pehle congress sarkaar ne jo kiya, yadi aapako bhi vahi karnaa he to kaise kaam hoga
 a shock was given to the secretary-level talks with Pakistan, but that is not enough
 goli kaa jawaab goli se kab diya jayega, sirf chetavanee dene se kya phayda
 The editorial article also mentions learning from Israel
 likhaa gaya he, chota-sa pakistan kahin zyaada balashaali bharat kii naak main dam kar de, yah thik nahin he
 The central government should learn from Israel in such matters
 israel kaa ek bhi naagarik yaa sainik agar philstiniyon ke hamale main marataa he, to israel kam se kam 10 philstiniyon ko markar hi dam letaa he

 raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne kaha he ki rafel deal ko lekar modi sarkaar kii ore se har prakriya kaa paalan kiya gaya he
 According to the defense minister, the government did nothing wrong about the deal
 india today se khaas intervyuu main raksha mantri ne congress se sawaal kiya, ‘agar upie ke kaarykaal main hindustan aironautics limited ke saath deal ko lekar 95% baatcheet puri ho chuki thi to us vakt kii sarkaar ne baaki 5% bache kaam ko puraa karne ke liye kyon kadam nahin uthaae
 He (congress) should tell what was the secret behind the remaining 5%? Who then prevented them from proceeding to the deal
 ’nirmala sitaramanne ek angreji akhbaar main raksha mantralay main tatkaaleen sanyukt sachiv ke hawaale se chhapi khabar ko puri tarah galat bataaya
 The Defense Minister said that the first thing was the Cabinet approved the Rafale Deal in August 2016 and not in September
 sitambar main samjhauta hua tha
 The Defense Minister said that the Prime Minister does not take a decision on the price, technical aspects, quality etc
, there are separate delegations for all of them, who give their report after considering all the things
 raksha mantri ke mutabik akhbaar kii report main jis tatkaal sanyukt sachiv (equisisan manager) ke hawaale se asahmati ke note kii baat kii ja rahi he to uske khud manjuuri ke patr par dastakhat the
 The Defense Minister also said that those officers had gone abroad for training for a short-term course, which was already decided
 raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman kaa intervyuu lete rahul kanvalvipaksh kii ore se ye aarope lagaaya jaataa he ki upie ke samay 126 rafel vimaan lene kii baat thi jise endie sarkaar ne ghataakar 36 kar diya or raksha aapurti prakriyaaon kaa paalan nahin kiya gaya
 On such allegations, Nirmala Sitharaman said that during UPA, there was talk of 18 Rafalelane in flyway condition, which would have been sufficient for a squadron, the rest would be constructed under a timeline with HAL
 raksha mantri ne saaf kiya ki bhartiya vayusena main ladaaku vimaanon kii kami ko dekhte hue argency ke taur par flive haalat main 36 rafel lene kaa faisla kiya, jinaki aapurti sitambar 2019 se honi bhi shuru ho jaati
 For the rest of Rafale aircraft, it would move forward through RFI (request for Interest)
 rafel deal ke liye modi sarkaar kii ore se jaldi dikhaae jane ke aaropon ko nirmala sitaraman ne khaarij kiya
 He said, "the squadron of Indian Air Force Keladaku aircraft had come down from 44 to 33
 2014 tak upie sarkaar ne is disha main tatkaal kadam uthaane kii jarurat kyon nahin samajhi
 The way they are now wasting energy in making noise of thieves and thieves, then why did they not show the energy they should have shown in the form of government
 isiilie hamane flive haalat main 36 rafel vimaan kharidne ke liye kadam uthaaya
 'never made a statement like calling HAL inefficient, the Defense Minister was asked in the interview if it was not right that if HAL had a chance to make these aircraft under technology transfer, then that institute would learn more in this area and later the country Would it be self-sufficient? The defense minister was also quoted as saying by the former chief of HAL that when HAL could build modern aircraft like fourth generation Sukhoi 30, would it be successful here? The Defense Minister said that these questions should be asked to the Defense Minister who was in the UPA tenure as to why steps were not taken to do all this in his time
 raksha mantri ne is baat kaa khandan kiya ki unhone kabhi HAL ke liye asaksham jaisaa shabd prayog kiya
 Nirmala Sitharaman claimed that during her time, Rs 22,000 crore was released to HAL every year, whereas during UPA, on an average, 10,000 crore was given every year
 nirmala sitaraman ne is baat se bhi inkaar kiya ki sarkaar rafel vimaan kii kharid keemat naa bataane par adi hui he
 The Defense Minister also said that there is nothing black in the lentils regarding the Rafale Deal
 nirmala sitaraman ne sidhe taur par to rafel kii kharid keemat nahin bataai lekin ye kaha ki wo pehle teen maukon par ye keemat bataa chuki hai jo record se check kiya ja saktaa he
 According to Raksha Matri, in November 2016, the Minister of State for Defense also stated this price
 anil ambani se jude vipaksh ke aaropon paranirmala sitaramanne kaha ki inter gavarment clearence (sarkaron ke bich samjhauton) main kisi ek company kaa naam nahin liya jaataa
 These are commercial decisions
 sarkaar is bare main tay nahin karti
 Regarding the conversation between Dassault Aviation and Reliance Defense regarding the offset, Nirmala Sitharaman said that she has no information about this
 jab ye jaankaree aegi tabhi wo kuch kehane kii sthiti main hongi
 There is not a single allegation of corruption and crony capitalism on Modi government
 Nirmala Sitharaman said, 'there is not a single allegation of corruption or crony capitalism on Modi government in four and a half years
 congress jo bhi aarope modi sarkaar par laga rahi he ve bebuniyaad hai
 As far as the opposition attacks on Narendra Modi are concerned, abuses have been used against him since 2002
 lekin ye sab jaanate hai ki bhrashtachar kaa shabd bhi unke paas aana sambhav nahin he
 Nirmala Sitharaman said that she did not know why former French President François Hollande said about Anil Ambani's company that it was the decision of the Indian government to link it to the deal
 nirmala sitaraman ne is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ki ho saktaa he ki oland ne france kii andruni raajnneeti ke dabaav main ye bayaan diya ho
 Modi government will never harm the country, according to the Defense Minister, decisions are being taken in the Ministry of Defense now and that too without brokers
 nirmala sitaraman ne jor dekar kaha ki modi sarkaar desh kaa kabhi koi nuksaan nahin hone degi

When asked about political conspiracy and personal enmity, they said that i have no evidence and do not make allegations without proof Wanted, but his intentions have certainly not been correct in the past

 Election Results 2019: haryana kii jat bahul rohtak loksabhaa seat par is baar dilachasp chunaav dekhne ko mila
 From here the BJP has crushed the myth of the Jat candidate winning
 loksabhaa chunaav ke itihaas main ab tak is seat par kisi dal ne gaiyr jat ummidavaar khadaa karne kaa risk nahin liya tha, magar bijepi ne 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main gaiyr jat card chalate hue pehali baar seat par camel khilaayaa he
 Considered the stronghold of the influential 'hooda Gharana' of Haryana, three-time Congress MP Deepender Hooda from this seat was replaced by bjp's Dr
 arvind sharma ke haathon romaanchak mukaable main haar jhelni padi he
 The battle over the seat was so interesting that supporters had to wait till four in the morning of May 24 for the results
 aakhri vakt main jeet-haar kaa faisla hua
 Devendra Hooda, son of former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, defeated Sharma by a margin of 7,503 votes in a thrilling contest
 rohtak me ab tak hue loksabhaa chunaav main das baar congress ko jeet mili he
 In which eight times only members of the Hooda Gharana were elected from here
 bijepi kii yah jeet is myne main bhi khaas maani ja rahi he, kyonki yahaan apni pakad majboot banane ke liye 2005-14 ke bich mukhyamantri rahane ke dauraan bhupendra singh hooda kaaphi bajet kharch kiye the
 Due to which they continued to win
 2004 tak saansad rahe bhupendra hooda jab 2005 se mukhyamantri bane to unhone seat bete deependra ke hawaale kar di
 After which he continued to win
 jat bahulya seat par hooda gharaane kii majboot pakad kii vajah se 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main yahaan prachand modi lahar fail ho gai thi
 Then Congress candidate Deepender Hooda gave BJP 1 here
 70 lakh voton se haraaya tha
 But this time, due to the inflexible strategy of the BJP, the Congress also had to face defeat in this only remaining seat
 kaise jiti bijepi?rohtak main kul 16
 Considering the number of more than six lakh Jat voters out of 66 lakh voters, it was a myth that only Jat candidates would win from here
 magar bijepi ne ek ranneeti ke tahat is baar gaiyr jat card khelkar voton ke dhruvikaran kii koshish kii, yah daanv safal bhi rahaa
 BJP strategists believed that the Hooda family has a strong hold on the Jat vote, so it is necessary to stand on non-jat candidates and focus on non-jat votes
 chunaav me modi lahar kii vajah se jahaan bijepi kuch jat votbank main bhi send lagane main safal rahi, vahiin gaiyr jat voters party kii chhatari tale ekajute ho gaye
 If we look at the caste equation of Rohtak, then there are four lakh Dalits after Jats, besides about two lakh voters of Yadav and other castes
 gaiyr jaaton ke ekajute hokar bijepi ko vot karne se jat bahul is seat par congress teen baar ke saansad deependra hooda apni seat nahin bachaa sake
 Arvind Yadav's unmistakable strategy: BJP engaged Haryana State Vice President Arvind Yadav to demolish Hooda family stronghold in Rohtak
 30 saal se adhik samay se rohtak se naata rakhane vaale arvind yadav ne chunaav kaa puraa blueprint taiyaar kiya
 Arvind's plan, despite being a new face in Rohtak, made it easier for the doctor Arvind Sharma to win by profession
 aajtak
 In conversation with in, Arvind Yadav gave full credit for this victory to the development work of Modi wave and the Khattar government of the state
 unhone kaha ki bhale hi arvind sharma ke liye rohtak kaa kshetra nayaa rahaa, magar unhone subah chah se lekar raat do baje tak sakriy rahakar sansadeey seat ke 80 se 85 pratishat ilaakon main maujuudagi darj karai
 This is a record in itself
 poling ke aakhri dinon main janata unke paksh main jhuk gai or nateeja aaj saamne he
 Except the victory of Jana Sangh twice, BJP has won here for the first time
 arvind yadav ke mutabik centre or rajya donon main bijepi sarkaar hone se is baar 'pro-inkamabency lahar' thi
 The way the Khattar government ensured transparency in jobs, the public felt that this time they should vote beyond caste, religion and region
 teen dashak main sirf do baar haara hooda parivarrohtak kii loksabhaa seat par pichley teen dashak main yah duusari baar he, jab hooda parivaar ko haar mili
 Bhupendra Hooda continued to win Lok Sabha elections till 1991, 96, 98
 phir 1999 main bijepi- inelo gathbandhan ne milakar chunaav ladaa
 Then Captain Inder Singh was successful in defeating Bhupendra Hooda on the INLD seat
 us vakt bhi arvind yadav chunaav sanchaalak the
 But after this, from 2004 to 2014 the seat was again occupied by the Hooda family
 ab 2019 main yahaan bijepi kii jeet hui he
 Let me tell you that Ranbir Singh of Hooda family won the Rohtak seat in the first elections after independence from 1951-52 to 1957 and then also in the elections of 1967
 sirf 1962, 1971 main is seat par jansangh or 1977, 1980 main janata party or 1989 main samaajawaadee party se choudhary devilal hi hooda parivaar se alag chunaav jeetne main safal hue the

 enditivi ko sutron ke hawaale se pataa chalaa he ki jammu-kashmir main haal hi main kiye gaye baari suraksha intjaamon ke bich aatankwaadiyon kii ore se aisi harakat kii gai he lekin bhartiya sena kii ore se kii gai javaabi karrwai main 5 ghuspaithiye maar giraae gaye hai

 After Rohit's death, Sushil's complaint has been exposed many times by the protesting students
 aisa bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki is shikaayat kii vajah se hi rohit ne khudakushi karne kaa faisla liya
 Some people also say that the pressure on the university by Union Minister Bandaru Dattatreya is also the cause of Vemula's death somewhere

 "in August, Ambedkar Students Association protested against the hanging of Yakub Memon and Rohit Vemula and his friend were offering prayers for Yakub Memon
" faansee ke khilaaf apni baat rakhana galat nahin he, is tarah kii bahes hona bhi thik he lekin unka 'har ghar main yaqub hoga' jaise naare lagaana kaaphi vichlit kar dene vaali baat thi
 "investigate why Rohit committed suicide", while expressing his opinion about Rohit, Sushil said "rohit was not a boy who would take the path of suicide so easily
" ham sab nahin samaj paa rahe hai ki vah kis baat se avsaad main chalaa gaya
 We too need an answer to this question and there should be a rigorous inquiry and the culprits should be punished

 According to sources, the BJP is trying to join the ruling AIADMK of Tamil Nadu
 endie main shaamil hogi aiadmkprapwa jaankaree ke mutabik, bijepi ke kuch sheersh netaa AIADMK netaaon ke saath baatcheet kar rahe hai
 At the same time, both the factions of AIADMK, a cabinet minister of Modi government, are mediating between Planiswami and Panneerselvam
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki agar yah baatcheet safal rahati he, to tamilnadu kii sattadhari partndie sarkaar main shamilho jaaegi
 It is being told that the Modi cabinet has not been expanded for this reason
 sutron ke mutabik agast main modi cabinet kaa vistaar sambhav he, jisamen ediemke ko bhi cabinet berth diya ja saktaa he
 After Jayalalithaa's demise, AIADMK pulled in former CM of Tamil Nadu and AIADMK chief J
 jayalalita ke nidhan ke baad se hi sattadhari party main khinchataan shuru ho gai thi
 After Jayalalithaa's departure, o Panneerselvam (OPS), who was made the CM, was removed by party general secretary Sasikala and replaced e Palaniswamy (EPS) as chief minister
 shashikala ke is kadam ke baad panniraselvam ne baghawat kar di or is tarah rajya kii sattadhari party do dhadon opies or ipies main bant gai
 The bjp's Mission South formula, however, is now reported that the BJP is trying to reunite these two factions of the ruling AIADMK
 yahaan donon hi dhadon ko panniraselvam kii lokapriyata kaa ehsaas he
 In such a situation, according to the formula of the reconciliation of OPS and EPS faction, Sasikala will continue to be the general secretary of the party, while OPS can be given senior position in the party
 sutron ke mutabik, ipies rajya ke mukhyamantri bane rahenge, jabaki opies ko rajyasabha kii sadsyta dekar centre main ahm jimmedaari di ja sakati he
 Sasikala needs to be meditated, however, one more thing to note here is that Sasikala, close to Jayalalithaa, who manages the party's fund, hardly let herself loose her grip on the party
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki vah donon ke is milaap main roda jarur daalane kii koshish karengi
 At the same time, Sasikala's son and party's deputy general secretary TTV Dinakaran has called a meeting of mlas on August 5 at the party headquarters
 bataaya jaataa he ki jail main band shashikala kii party par pakad bhale hi kamjor hui he, lekin ab bhi kai vidhayakon unke saath bane hue hai
 In such a situation, BJP also has a special eye on this meeting of Dinakaran
