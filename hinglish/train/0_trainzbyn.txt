 The effect of solar eclipse will remain on America for the next one month
 jisaki vajah se america ko aarthik, saamaajik kshetra main kai chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa padegaa

 If the horoscope is made at that time, then Leo ascendant horoscope is formed, in which Rahu and Mercury are sitting in the 12th house
 yesoorya grahabhi singh raashi or magha nakshatra main padaa he
 Therefore, it will have a special effect on Leo ascendant America for 30 days
 america kaa hoga ye hallmerica kii kundali main 12wein ghar main rahu or budh hone kii vajah se kai tarah ke bhram samaaj main fail sakate hai

 What to do for the next 30 days - People living in the US will have to show restraint, calm their mind and make decisions with thought
 kisi ke bahekaave main aakar koi bhi kaam karne se bachanaa hoga
 - The US government will have to avoid taking any sensitive decision for the next 30 days
 desh ke aarthik or saamaajik hit ko dhyaan main rakh kar kaary karnaa hoga
 -american government will suddenly have to refrain from making any decision

 Nitish Kumar did not attend the function organized in Lucknow on the completion of 25 years of SP
 na hi congress kaa koi netaa najar aayaa tha
 Keep in mind that out of 405 seats in the 2012 assembly elections held, JDU did not get a single seat while Ajit Singh's party won 9 seats
 pichley varsh, bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan jediu, rajd, congress or samaajawaadee party ne 'mahagathbandhan' banaakar chunaav ladane kaa elaan kiya tha lekin baad main mulaayam singh mahagathbandhan se yah kehete hue alag ho gaye the ki unki party ko bahut kam site di ja rahi hai

 Nor did any Congress leader appear
 dhyaan rahe ki 2012 main yojit vidhansabha chunaav main 405 siton main se jediu ko ek bhi seat nahin mili thi jabaki ajit singh kii party ne 9 siton par jeet darj kii thi

 (applause) "prime Minister Narendra Modi said this in his 28-minute vigorous speech on October 11, 2014, while launching the MP Adarsh gram Yojana (SAGY) on the birth anniversary of Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan
 darasal pradhanmantri misaal de rahe the ki agar kisi gaanv main 25 garbhvatee mahilaon ke liye paushtik bhojan kii vyavastha kerani ho to sarkari dharre se kaam karne par itnaa samay lagata he, jabaki esaejivai ke tahat jab gaanv vaale khud faisla karenge, to yahi kaam badi aasaani se ho jayega
 Apparently, the same euphoria was hidden in the applause that the Prime Minister, who finally claimed to have visited more than 5,000 villages in the country, laid out an innovative plan for rural India free of red tape
 or sanyog dekhie ki pradhanmantri ke is bhaashan ke thik chah maheene baad jab yah khabar likhi ja rahi he to esaejivai thik usee sarkari prakriya kii thokaren kha rahi he, jis par modi ne kataaksh kiya tha
 Director of SAGY in the Ministry of Rural Development, who conducts the scheme, Dr
 kushal pathak ne india today ko jo bataaya, usase pariyojna kii sust chaal khud-ba-khud saaf hoti he, ''esaejivai main abhi gram vikaas yojana (vidipi) banane kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 Development works in villages will start from August 2015
 yah kaam 2016 ke ant tak puure kiye jaaenge
 "(see conversation) In this speech, the Prime Minister had said that if the State Governments also prepare the MLA Adarsh gram Yojana on the lines of mps, then every year 7,000 to 8,000 such Adarsh villages will be prepared in the country, Will be an example
 is tarah desh main adarsh gaanvon kii bayaar aa jaaegi
 But according to the data published on the SAGY website, so far all the mps have not chosen their ideal village
 aise saansadon main loksabhaa ke 55 or rajyasabha ke 62 saansad shaamil hai
 The mps who have selected the village also have a relationship with their village named Barae
 is khabar main adarsh gaanvon ke report card se jaahir he ki bijepi ke calraj mishra jaise mantri or rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke saansad putr dushyant singh to aaj tak gaanv gaye hi nahin he
 Rajnath Singh and General V
 ke
 Ministers like Singh have once performed the formalities of village darshan
 darasal, saansadon kii samasya yah he ki yojana ke liye alag se koi paisa nahin diya gaya he
 Guidelines for implementing the scheme have also been fulfilled by going in March
 duusari ore gaanv waalon ko yah lag rahaa he ki itane bade mantri ne gaanv god le liya he to ab to chaaron taraf khushhaali hogi
 In such a situation, he saves his MP fund by taking it to the MP, if he spends it on one village then what will he spend in the remaining 1,000 villages and a dozen towns in the parliamentary constituency
 uttar pradesh se samaajawaadee party ke rajyasabha saansad naresh agarwal ne to isaki kaat yah nikaali ki unhone hardoi main sadai behata naam ke jis gaanv ko god liya tha, use waapas hi kar diya
 Listen to Agarwal's comment, "this plan will cause a quarrel in the villages
" vikaas hona he, to sab gaanvon kaa ho
 Secondly, there is no money in the plan, where will the development come from? '' dhur vipakshi dal ke hone ke kaaran agarwal to adarsh gaanv se pind chhudaa sakate hai, lekin jo namo-namo kaa jaap karke chunaav jite hai, unhen yah suvidha hasil nahin he
 In such a situation, ministers like Giriraj Singh and Uma Bharti have cut out that the village in good condition is chosen so that it is sweet enough in a little jaggery
 haa, krishi mantri radha mohan singh jaise saansadon ne badahaal gaanv god liya he or vahaan kaam bhi shuru kara die hai
 And the point is that in the Prime Minister's village, the development works are going on in large numbers from the generosity of private companies
 baaki saansad tay sarkari prakriya se kadam-dar-kadam vikaas kii baat kah rahe hai
 And their thinking is not wrong either
 esaejivai ke paas apana paisa to he nahin, aise main sarkaar ne vyavastha kii he ki vibhinn mantralayon kii pehle se chali aa rahi ek darjan se adhik yojanaon main se kuch hissaa adarsh gaanv ke liye sunishchit kar diya jaae
 Almost all of these schemes are of the era of the UPA government
 haa, kuch puraani yojanaon ke nae naam jarur rakhe gaye hai
 Just like the Rajiv Gandhi Rural Electrification Mission is now called Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana
 gramin vikaas mantralay ne disambar, 2014 se march, 2015 ke bich in yojanaon kii guidelins main badlaav kar inhen esaejivai se joda he
 That is, the work of preparing the plan continued till mid-march
 isiilie apane sansadeey kshetra guna main adarsh gram god lene ke baavjood congress netaa or upie sarkaar main urja mantri rahe jyotiraditya sindhiya chunauti dete hai, ''haa, maine gaanv kaa chayan kar liya he
 Now let Vikas Modi

 These mps are not Adarsh gram Yojana, Adarsh fraud Scheme
 '' sindhiya kaa daawa he ki bhale hi sarkaar vibhinn yojanaon se is yojana ko jodgaye kii baat kahe, lekin asal main sarkaar har yojana kaa paisa sirf kaat hi rahi he
 There is no need to go far to see the plight of the plan being prepared in the ideal village of ministers
 rajdhani dilli se sate gajiabad sansadeey kshetra ke mirpur hindu gaanv kii kahani kuch aisi hi he
 This is Minister of State for External Affairs General V

 The ideal village of Singh is
 gaanv ke sarkari up-swasthya centre or panchayat bhawan main bhainsen bandhi hai
 If no doctor came to the sub-health center for so many years, a homeless Muslim family made it their permanent home
 gaanv ke logon se jab vikaas kii baat karo to unka pehla sawaal hota he, ''hamaari pehali or aakhri maang he ki gaanv main prastaavit land phil (kachra phenkane vaale sthaan) kii yojana ko radd karaayaa jaae
 "there is a lot of talk of women empowerment in SAGY, but instead of village head Rekha Bansal, her father-in-law and former head Shishpal Bansal talks only
 unka kahana he, ''mantriji ke adarsh gaanv ko god lene ke baad ham is baat kaa intjaar kar rahe hai ki jo kaam is yojana main hon, unheen ke saath ham panchayat kii yojanaon ko jod den
 At the moment the wait continues
 '' mantri ke press salaahkaar es
 P
 singh ne bataaya, ''gaanv ke master plan par kaam chal rahaa he
 Construction of toilets has been started
 pine ke pani or 24 ghante bijli ke liye solar plant kaam jald shuru hoga
 "the villagers affirm that the village is still in the same condition as it was before the adoption
" unhen is baat kii tis jarur he ki olavrishti main gaanv main bade paimaane par fasal barabaad hone ke baavjood sarkari record main gaanv main fasal barabaad hona nahin dikhaaya gaya he
 What is the use of a commander who cannot reach the request of ruined farmers? udhar, grih mantri rajnath singh apane sansadeey kshetra lakhanu ke benti gaanv main ab tak bank kii ek shakha, chota daakghar or kuch gharon main shauchalay banavaa paae hai
 The village is still battling for basic facilities for health and education
 udhar, emsamai mantri calraj mishra ne devaria sansadeey kshetra main payaasi gaanv ko god liya he
 There is a saying about this village - a hundred times Kashi and once thirsty
 phir bhi mantriji ek bhi baar gaanv nahin aae hai or na hi jamini str par koi kaam ab tak hua he
 However, Mishra MP representative Vijay Kumar Dubey says, "till now officers from 40 departments have held meetings
" gaanv main 567 shauchalayon ko manjuuri mil chuki he or 273 mahilaon ko sphurti yojana main chunaa gaya he
 On the other hand, the MP from Agra and the Union Minister of State for Human Resource Development, Ramshankar Katheria, have so far installed only five submersible pumps in his model village Pilkhatara
 katheria kehete hai, ''gaanv main ek inter college, ek aspataal or har ghar main shauchalay banane kii yojana he
 "private companies have made Modi's Jayapuray talk about the rest of the mps and Ministers, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Parliamentary constituency Varanasi's model village Jayapur is different
 taarikh 13 april he or dopaher ke teen baje hai
 On the empty bench on the side of the road in Jayapur, Narendra Modi's statement is written, 'dreams,' which do not allow gold
 '' inhen bench ke thik peeche jameen par bichhi taat-pattee par baithe naunihaal apni kitaab-copy sanbhale apane sunahare bhavishya ke sapane bunane main tallin the
 These children, studying from nursery to first grade, were learning the basics of their basic education in a private coaching center in the village
 kisi vidambnaa he ki gujarat kii ek company ne jayapur main sau se zyada bench to laga deen lekin bacchon ke bhagya main ek adad kursi-mej tak na ai
 The village has become a bus stop dotted with pictures of Narendra Modi and painted saffron
 ek choti bas bhi mukhya sadak tak jane lagi he
 Solar lamps have arrived in the village
 lekin inamen se koi bhi kaam sarkaar kaa nahin balki gujarat kii nijee companiyon kaa he
 After the adoption of Jayapur last year, private companies have made a mark of their own interests in the village of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who made the formal start of access development here on November 7 for the first time
 khaas baat to yah he ki inamen zyaadaatar companiyaan kisi na kisi rup se gujarat se judi hai
 Chandrakant Raghunath Patil, MP from Navsari in Gujarat and Modi's representative in Jayapur, says, "if goods are available in Gujarat at less than half the price of UP, then there is no harm in getting help from the companies there
 keval gujarat kii company hi nahin, varanasi main rohaniyaan kii ek company ne bhi jayapur main rojgarparak kaarykram shuru karne kii peshkash kii he
 "A private company has built houses for all 14 Musahar families at the western end of the village
" ahmedabad kii ek company ne gaanv main 450 shauchalay taiyaar karne kaa bidaa uthaaya he
 State-of-the-art solar pumps are ready just behind the bus stand in the village, which has been connected to a tank with a capacity of 5,000 liters of water
 jald hi ek nijee company jayapur main do lakh litre kshamta kii pani kii tank banane ke saath-saath pipe ke jariye gaanv ke sabhi gharon main muft pani pahunchane kii vyavastha bhi karegi
 a new change in the government sector has come from the influx of new banks in Jayapur amidst the increasing activity of private companies
 pichley chah maheenon main is gaanv main union bank, syndicate bank or state bank kii shakhaaen khuli hai
 Om Prakash, assistant manager of Syndicate Bank opened in Jayapur, says villagers are only interested in opening an account under the Jan Dhan Yojana
 '' agar sarkari kaam kii baat karen to ''bharat sarkaar vastra mantralay'' kii ''kaaleen niryaat sanvardhan parishad'' ne jayapur ke ek khaali pade bhawan main mahilaon ke liye hathkargha kaaleen prashikshan centre kholaa he
 No one has improved the only government primary school in Jayapur, which is in disarray
 gaanv kii pradhan durgavati pradesh kii sapa sarkaar ko dosha detii hai, ''dm kai baar gaanv aae lekin unhone ab tak kisi bhi sarkari yojana kii shuruyaat gaanv main nahin karwaai he
 "however, Varanasi District Collector Pranjal Yadav says," There is no discrimination from any village or region in the district
 ''vaise modi ne bhi 11 aktubar ke bhaashan main kaha tha, ''ek gaanv ko adarsh banane kii prakriya main saansadon ko pataa chalegaa ki sarkari yojanaon main kya khamiyaan hai or ye kaise dur ho sakati hai
 When those mps raise these problems in the Parliament, they will have to listen to whatever government has majority
 isse gaanvon ke vikaas kii or behatar yojanaayen banengi 
 "now the Prime Minister himself has brightened his village with the help of private companies, but the rest of the mps are circling the maze of schemes
" logon ko na yojana ke baarik byore se matlab he or na bajet praavdhaanon se unhen to adarsh gaanv chahie, jiske liye abhi intjaar he
 (together Kumar Harsh, Siraj Qureshi, Sameer Garg, Mahesh Sharma, Ashok Kumar Priyadarshi and Piyush Pachak) jalwaayu parivartan sambandhi sanstha ipisisi dwaara gambhir vaigyanik bhuulon ko sweekaar kiye jane ke baad jalwaayu parivartan ke kaaran 2035 tak himalay ke adhiktar glaciaron ke pighalane ke bare main di gayi chetavanee ko gumraah karne vaala kaha ja rahaa he
 a comprehensive report was presented two years ago by the Intergovernmental Committee on Climate Change (IPCC) headed by Rajendra Pachauri of India
 is report main global varming ke sambandh main naveenatam or atyadhik anusandhan kaa hawala diya gaya tha
 Its main message was that the world's glaciers are melting rapidly and by 2035 the Himalayan glaciers will cease to exist
 ‘sande times’ ne ravivaar ko khabar di he ki kuch dinon pehle vaigyanikon ne sweekaar kiya tha ki unki global varming report lokapriy vigyaan jarnal ‘new scientist’ kii ek news story par aadhaarit thi
 This newsstory was published eight years before the ipcc's 2007 report
 is report main yah baat bhi ubhar kar saamne aayi he ki new scientist kii news story bhi bhartiya vaigyanik saiyad hasanan ke laghu telephoni intervyuu par aadhaarit thi jo us samay jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay main adhyaapan karte the
 According to the newspaper Hasnain has since stated that his claim was an inference and no formal research was done in this regard
 yadi is baat kii pushti ho jaye to jalwaayu parivartan anusandhan ke sambandh main yah ek gambhir vifaltaa hogi
 The IPCC was established to enable the world to receive the best scientific advice on climate change
 isse pehle himalay par is report kii vaigyanik sabooton par khara nahin kah kar aalochana kii gayi lekin rajendra pachori ne ise khaarij kiya tha or pichley saptaah ipisisi ne is report par tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya tha
 This mistake was discovered by a team of scientists working under the leadership of geographer Graham Kogle of Trent University, who was angry with the findings of the IPCC for a long time
 kogale ne pataa lagaaya ki ipisisi kaa daawa ‘new scientist’ kii report kaa hi pun:ullekh he or iske baad unhone patrkaar fred piers se sampark kiya jinhone vaastavik saakshaatkaar liya tha
 Pearce then interviewed Hasnain again, who stated that the comments made in 1999 were based on estimates
 piers ne adhyatan jaankaree ‘new sanitist’ main prakashit kii
 Pearce approached the scientist in 1999 after Hasnain's report was published in an Indian journal

 India's patience is responding because of Pakistan's obstinate attitude
 mumbai ke hamalaavaron ko insaaf kii dahalij tak laane kii hamaari koshish pakistani chalbaaji kaa shikaar ho rahi he
 That is why India is now planning to take action against Pakistan

 Initially, the needle of suspicion went to Rajesh Talwar, then to his friends' domestic helpers, then to Rajesh and his wife
 yah maamla hameshaa se hi media main chaaya rahaa
 In August 2009, the Supreme Court banned sensational reporting on the media
 talwaar danpati ne sibiai par aarope lagaaya tha ki jaanch ko modane or kathith rup se kai chizon ko li karke unki chhavi ko 'nuksaan' pahunchaaya gaya
 The Uttar Pradesh police conducted their investigation on the basis that Hemraj killed Aarushi and escaped from the scene

 dilachasp baat yah he ki jin aavedakon ne achche numberon se pariksha urtteen kii he unke naate rishtedaar sabhi ne ek kamare main or aasapaas baithkar hi parchaa hal kiya tha
 Medical administration is under the scanner after most members of the same family won

 In this, many people from the same family were selected
 bhartee main topper rahe rabindra vaishnav ne pariksha main sau fisadi ank hasil kiye hai, unhen kul ank 60 main 60 ank hasil hue

 This case is related to Lakhiram Agarwal Memorial Government Medical College in Raigarh district of Chhattisgarh
 merit suchi main ek hi parivaar ke kai logon kaa logon kaa chayan kiya gaya he
 Now after the matter is revealed, where the Dean is saying it is a coincidence, the Collector has given instructions to investigate the matter
 aarushi cese main shuruaati jaanch karne vaale daroga bachchu singh ab hatya ke ek maamle main funs gaye hai
 Let me tell you, what is the whole matter
 darasal gajiabad ke thana kavinagar main disambar maheene ke pehle hafte main ek ladki ke gumshuda hone kii khabar ai
 The police immediately rushed their teams to different parts of Ghaziabad to locate the girl
 lekin tamaam jagah talaashi lene ke baad bhi police ko koi maamuli suraag bhi nahin mila
 The police also started rinsing the mobiles of the girl and all the family members of the girl to pursue the investigation
 police jab ladki ke gharavaalon ke mobile khangaal rahi thi tabhi uski nazar ek dhundhlee si tasviir par ja tiki
 The police came to know from the families that the appearance of the mobile phone was visible to those people a few days ago
 or phir wo cheharaa aksar unke ghar par nazar aane laga
 Actually, that face in the picture was of a friend of that missing girl
 or us saheli ke bare main gharavaalon ne jo kuch bhi bataaya wo bhi police ko kuch ajeeb nahin laga
 
 
 Still, the police went out in search of the girl imprisoned in the mobile ab police ke saamne do ladakiyon kii talash kii chunauti thi, jise 50 lakh kii aabaadi vaale gajiabad main dhundhana police ke liye andheri kothri main sui dhundne jaisaa tha
 So the police took the picture in hand and went out in search of the missing girl's friend
 gajiabad kii sadakon par din raat daudti police kii koshish aakhirkaar rang laai or jaldi hi uske haath wo cheharaa lag gaya, jise haathon main mobile par lekar wo dar dar bhatak rahi thi
 The girl was accompanied by her husband
 us ladki kaa naam rashmi he or wo apane pati amarpal ke saath gajiabad main hi rahati he
 Rashmi, a journalist by profession, had befriended the girl, who is currently missing, and the police found it necessary to reach Rashmi only to find out her address
 rashmi ne kiya tha naukari dilaane kaa vadapulice ne us gumshuda ladki kaa pataa jaanane ke liye rashmi se poochtacha kaa silsilaa shuru kiya
 Rashmi told the police everything about her friendship with the missing girl
 usne ye bhi khulaasa kiya ki usne rashmi ko naukari dilaane kaa bhi vaayada kiya tha
 But suddenly that girl went missing
 police jab rashmi se kuch hasil nahin kar saki tab usne rashmi ke pati kaa munh khulwaane kaa iraadaa kiya
 Because the police knew Amarpal's past well
 lihaaja police amarpal ke saath thodaa sakhti se pesh ai
 
 
 This police effort was successful
 police ke tevar se amarpal tut gaya or phir jab usne munh kholaa to katl ke ek kisse ke saath saath ek vardi vaale kaa cheharaa bhi saamne aa gaya
 Murder of the same missing girl, in whose search the police was wandering rate by rate
 amarpal ne ye bhi khulaasa kiya ki katl kii wo sajeesh kisne or kaise rachi or phir use kaise anjaam tak pahunchaaya gaya
 Amarpal was given by Bachu Singh Supari Amarpal told the police that the entire plot of this dreaded murder plot was created by none other than Daroga Bachu Singh, who was posted in Ghaziabad
 amarpal ke munh kholte hi police ne turant rashmi or amarpal ke saath saath bachchu singh or uske saathi sipaahi vinesh ko giraftaar kar liya
 Let us tell you that Bachhu Singh is the same officer of Uttar Pradesh Police who played a big role in the murder of Aarushi and Hemraj
 aarushi or hemraj ke katl ke vakt yani may 2008 main bachchu singh noida ke sector 20 thane main tainaat tha
 And he did the initial investigation of the country's biggest murder mystery
 baad main vahi bachchu singh katl ke us cese kaa ahm gavaah bhi bana tha
 The plot of the murder of that missing girl was hatched by this Bachhu Singh with one of his sergeants
 
 And that too when he was stationed at Baghpat's Taki Chowki
 bachchu singh ke ishaare par uske maatahat kaam karne vaale sipaahi vinesh ke saath us ladki ke katla kaa sara taana bana buna or phir vinesh ne hi katl kii supaari profeshnal killer amarpal ko di
 How Amarpal's wife Rashmi was used to trap the girl in the conspiracy trap
 rashmi ne pehle ladki se dosti kii or paise or naukari dilaane ke bahaane se use gajiabad ke bas adde par milane bulaayaa
 The date was 30 November
 bas adde par amarpal apane ek saathi ke saath pehle se hi maujuud tha
 The two took the girl on a bike and took her to Aligarh and strangled her with a dupatta and escaped the corpse by hiding it in the canal
 or hatya kii vajah?darasal is kisse kii shuruyaat bachchu singh ke bete or ek ladki kii prem kahani se shuru hoti he
 Bachu Singh's son Tarun was sexually abusing the girl by pretending to be married, and when it pressed for marriage, Tarun refused to marry
 har taraf se maayoos hokar is ladki ne march 2013 tarun ke khilaaf balaatkaar kaa maamla darj kara diya
 When the case of rape against the son was registered in the police station, Bachu Singh did not accept this
 lihaaja usne kai baar ladki par samjhauta karne kaa dabaav banaaya
 Meanwhile, Bachhu Singh was transferred to Baghpat Keattari post
 apane ladke kii giraftaar se pareshaan bachchu singh ne apni pareshaani chaowkee main hi tainaat sipaahi ko bataai or phir usee sipaahi ne bachchu singh kii mulaakaat supaari killer amarpal se kara di
 The entire case of the girl's disappearance was blind and the police had only one phone number in the name of the clue from which the last time a number was called
 police kii tafteesh main hi ye khulaasa hua ki vah number vaardaat se ek hafte pehle hi actevet karaayaa gaya tha
 Then the second clue was found in the hands of the police in the face of that blurred photo of Rashmi
 
 
 or phir puri sajeesh kii tasviir saaf ho gai

 Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawwad, a member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, reacted to Laden's death, stating that the end of Laden alone would neither end terrorism nor weaken it
 abhi laden maaraa gaya he, lekin al kaayda or taliban kaa vajood baaki he
 Praying for the elimination of terrorism from the world, he feared that the second line of leadership in Al Qaeda and the Taliban remained and that they could increase their terrorist activities in response to the killing of Laden
 javwaad ne laden ke maare jane ke america ke daavon par andeh vyakt karte hue kaha ki america kaa bayaan bharose ke kaabil nahin he
 It remains to be seen whether bin Laden has been killed or not? He said that a large section of Muslims disliked Laden because thousands of Muslims have also been killed in the attacks at his behest
 is bich, jamiyat ulma-e-hind ke adhyaksh kaari saiyad mohammad osman ne bhi javwaad kii is baat se ittefaq jaahir karte hue kaha ki abhi surat-e-haal puri tarah saaf hone dijie

 Abdullah, who attended the Kalki festival, said that America, Britain and some other major western countries are responsible for terrorism
 in takaton ne hi aatankwaad paidaa kiya or ab jab dehshatgard log un par hi hamale kar rahe hai to ve chilla rahe hai
 The comments purv kendriya mantri ne kaha ki musalmaan kabhi aatankwaadi nahin ho saktaa
 The terrorists are the people who have been raised by America and its allies
 jammu-kashmir vivaad ko sirf baatcheet se hi hal kiye jane kii jarurat par jor dete hue unhone kaha ki is masale ko lekar pakistan se chaar baar ladaai ho chuki he, lekin koi hal nahin niklaa
 On cow slaughter, Abdullah said that if a community feels bad about cow slaughter then such work should not be done
 abdulla ne is maukey par manch se ‘raghupati raghav raja ram’ bhajan gaakar upasthit logon ko mantrmugdh kiya
 Former Union Minister said that Muslims can never be terrorists
 dehshatgard to ve hi log hai jinhen america or uske saathiyon ne khadaa kiya he
 Emphasizing that the Jammu and Kashmir dispute needs to be resolved only through dialogue, he said that Pakistan has been fought on this issue four times, but no solution was found
 gohatya par abdulla ne kaha ki gaay kii hatya par agar kisi samudaay ko bura lagata he to aisa kaam nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Abdullah enchanted the audience by singing the hymn 'raghupati Raghav Raja Ram' from the stage on the occasion

 tendulkar ko haalanki apni patni ke liye letters likhane se pehle bhi mehnat kerani padati thi
 He smiled and said, 'it was natural for me to hit the cricket ball but while writing the letter to Anjali, i kept checking what i was writing
 'tendulkar ne yahaan handriting ko badhaava dene ke ek kaarykram ke dauraan kaha, 'un dinon mobile nahin hua karte the or sanchaar ke ekmaatr saadhan landline phone yaa patr hua karte the
 i started writing letters
 maine apane mata-pita ko patr likhane se shuruyaat kii or baad main kuch patr patni (anjali) ke liye bhi likhe
 Tendulkar says that writing letters for Anjali was harder than batting
 unhone yaad kiya ki kis tarah se unke mata pita ne unhen pen thaamna or likhnaa sikhaaya tha
 Tendulkar said, 'after this, when i lived away from family, i started writing letters for my parents and later for my wife
 ' tendulkar ne kaha ki amuman doctoron kii likhaawat saaf suthri nahin hoti lekin peshey se doctor anjali is maamle main apwaad thim
 He said, 'his handwriting is very beautiful
 use dekhakar koi bhi prerit ho saktaa he
 And to whom was the worst handwriting, Tendulkar said, 'you usually pay attention to the best things'
 sanyas ke baad kii jindagi ke bare main tendulkar ne kaha, 'jindagi khubasurat he
 i am getting enough time to spend time with my children
 main ab adhik nahin kheltaa
 Sometimes i play with my son
 'sachin ne yah bhi kaha ki wo ab aatmakatha likh rahe hai
 When asked about this, Sachin said, 'yes, i am writing, but will give information about this when the appropriate time comes
 ' patrakaron ne jab sachin ko is bare main zyada kureda to unhone kaha ki agar main sab kuch yaheen bataa duungaa, to phir meri kitaab koi nahin padhegaa'ek nijee company ke prayaas se handriting ko badhaava dene ke liye yahaan pahunche tendulkar ne handriting or batting ke kaushal main tulana karte hue kaha, 'ek baar aap jab inhen sikh lete ho to ye hameshaa aapke saath rahete hai
 Start anything in life, basics are always important
 unhone kaha, 'main daayen haath se nahin likh saktaa
 i hope there will be some technique that will teach us to write with the right hand too but i can eat with both hands
 tendulkar daayen haath ke ballebaaj hai lekin likhane ke liye apane baayen haath kaa upyog karte hai

 kenya kii yah lagaataar chauthi haar he
 Batting has been the biggest weakness of Canada in this tournament, but today he was able to overcome this weakness due to Hansra and Bagai

 colins obuya (31) bhi kuch achche shaat khilne ke baad baidwan kii gend ko line main aaye bina khilne ke prayaas main bold hue
 When Steve Ticolo (12) also could not last long, it seemed that Canada would soon cover the Kenyan innings and make the match unilateral, but Mumbai-born 24-year-old batsman Mishra played a moderate knock on such an occasion
 mishra ko commande ke rup main acha jodidar mila or in donon ne 14 over tak koi wicket nahin girane diya
 Leg-spinner Balaji Rao, who played Ranji Trophy in India, broke this partnership by dismissing the commande
 commande turn leti gend par kadamon kaa sahi istemaal nahin kar paye or us par balla ada baithe
 Bagai did the rest

 ' You must have heard stories of the twin brothers falling apart and growing up in Bollywood films
 punjab main hakeekat main aisa maamla saamne aayaa he
 Things were different as soon as two twin brothers were born 15 and a half years ago
 kareeb ek haftaa pehle in donon bhaaiyon ko fasebuk ne aapas main mila diya
 The two brothers met each other playing online games
 donon kii shakl itani milti he ki ek bhai ne chating par is baat par jhagada bhi kiya ki meri photo kyon laga rakhi he
 He also accused the other brother that he kept a fake profilabana using the photo
 lekin aage jo khulaasa hua, wo hairaan karne vaala tha
 One was Jalandhar and the other lived in Ludhiana
 The story is about two brothers named Hemant and Shivam
 hairat kii baat he ki donon bhai 2001 se ek duusare se juda the lekin jin do shaharon main ye rah rahe the unke bich kii duuri mahaj 67 kilometre he
 Hemant was living in Jalandhar and Shivam in Ludhiana
 is kahani ko samajhane ke liye pehle 2001 main lautnaa hoga
 Journalist Arjun Sharma and his wife Anjali were to adopt a child by profession in Jalandhar
 unhen kisi madhyasth ke madhyam se pataa laga ki ek talakshuda mahila ne 14 sitambar 2001 ko do judawaan beton ko janm diya he
 The woman could not bear the responsibility of both the children and hence wanted to adopt a child
 madhyasth ne hi is bare main baat kii or arjuna sharma ko baccha god mil gaya
 The rules of child adoption were not so stringent then as they are now
 is bachche kaa naam hemanth rakhaa gaya
 Arjun and Anjali tried their best not to let Hemant know that he was adopted
 vahiin uskaa judawaan bhai sivam apni maa minakshi ke paas hi palata rahaa
 There was a change in the behavior of Hemant, this continued for a long time
 lekin aaj se kareeb ek saal pehle hemanth ko kisi se pataa chal gaya ki wo arjuna or anjali kii sagi aulad nahin balki god liya hua he
 Since then, there was a change in the behavior of Hemant
 padhai main jo hemanth pehle bahut tej tha, uskaa padhai se bhi man uchatane laga
 He immediately started trying to find out the whole truth
 aakhir arjuna or anjali ko hemanth ko god lene kii baat bataani padi
 But he did not even know where Hemant's real mother and her twin brother live now
 vahiin duusari ore sivam maa minakshi ke saath ludhiana main rah rahaa tha
 He too came to know about others being twin brothers
 sivam bhi maa minakshi se judawaan bhai ko dhundne kii baat kahata tha
 Coincidentally, on February 9 this year, the day also came when the two brothers recognized each other through Facebook
 online game khelte hi donon ne video colling se ek duusare se baat kii
 After this, the two brothers could not stay and Shivam came to Jalandhar to meet Hemant the next day
 donon bhai aapas main milakar bahut khush hai
 Anjali's eyes are also deafening
 wo kahati hai ki ab unke do bete hai
 Arjun and Anjali want to become an IAS officer, it is said that both Hemant and Shivam become good human beings by studying and earn a name by growing up
 donon bhai, hemanth or sivam, saath mili to unki kai ek jaisi baaten or aadaten bhi saamne ai
 Just like once Hemant had hit a blade on his wrist in Jalandhar, Shivam did the same in Ludhiana
 donon ko kadi chaaval or chikan bahut pasand hai
 All their activities are also similar
 donon bhai bade hokar iees adhikari bananaa chaahate hai
 Things have definitely changed the surnames of the two brothers, where Hemant Sharma is there and Shivam Chopra
 donon bhaaiyon kii ab do-do maa hai
 What changes will come in their lives, it is not decided at the moment, but now they both want to spend more and more time with each other
 said ne kaha, ‘main bharat ko bataanaa chahta hum ki main kashmiriyon ko samarthan dena jari rakhuunga
 It does not matter what troubles there are
 bharat chahta he ki ham kashmiriyon ke liye awaajen uthaani band kar den
 He is pressurizing the Government of Pakistan

 Where did the giants constantly quit jobs? Infosys, representing the dreams of India's middle class, had everything - efficient teams, true value and the ability to earn money
 pichley teen saal ke dauraan company ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari company chhodte rahe or isaki vikaas dar bhi industry ke maanak par pichhadati rahi
 People were surprised
 iske peeche kai vajahen najar ain
 According to insiders, there are two reasons behind the current situation - the long-term chief executive holding the command of the founding members and Murthy's unexpected return to his son Rohan as an assistant executive
 adwijuri form ofshor incits ke siio sudin apte kehete hai, “nae siio niyukt karne kii infosis kii ghoshnaa or sabhi sansthaapakon kaa company chhodia aasaani se samaj main nahin aata

 Surprisingly Murthy came back as EC when it was being speculated in the industry that Infosys would bring in an outsider for the first time as CEO

 Now, the tip connecting the old guardian and the newly appointed head is the same — the designation given to Murthy: Chairman Emirates (retired chairman)

 When Harbhajan Singh, sitting on the seat of Anchor, asked the veterans, let us tell you that Bumrah's left thumb was injured during fielding in the first T20 match against Ireland
 jabaki sundar takhne kii chot ke kaaran england ke khilaaf tii-20 siries se baahar ho gaye he
 Sundar suffered this injury while playing football during India's first practice session in Malahide on Tuesday
 unki chot kaa scan kiya gaya he or bisisiai kii medical team un par nigaraanee banaae rakhegi
 Bumrah's exit is a setback for the team as he is a specialist bowler in limited overs cricket
 team prabandhan ko bumraah ke jald feet hone kii ummid rahegi taaki vah england ke khilaaf test siries main hissaa le sake
 Indian T20 team: Virat Kohli (captain), Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Lokesh Rahul, Suresh Raina, Manish Pandey, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (wicketkeeper), Dinesh Karthik, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Deepak Chahar, Krunal Pandya, Siddharth Kaul and Umesh Yadav
 kuch faislon kaa faisla samay par chhod dena chahie 2016 main ek ausat padhaa-likhaa vyakti bhi maanegaa ki chota parivaar sukhi hota he lekin '70 ke dashak ke shuruaati varshon main jab indira or sanjay gandhi nasbandi thope rahe the, tab tasviir shaayad note band hone kii afratfari jaisi hi rahi hogi
 History recorded indira-sanjay as the villain but family planning was considered necessary
 kaala dhan rokane ke liye arthvyavastha ko kuch samay ke liye viklang bana dene ke faisle par antim nirnay to samay ko dena he lekin philhal yah faisla bikharaav or araajaktaa se bharpoor he, haalanki isi kolahal main punarnirmaan ke sanket bhi mil jate hai
 At present, India is beginning to look like a country affected by financial disaster or the destruction of banks (recently Greece), where banks and atms are closed, long queues and people are forced to take and spend limited amounts of cash
 aise mulk main jahaan bahut badi arthvyavastha nakadi par chalati ho, 50 fisadi vayask logon kaa bainkon se koi lenaa-dena na ho or bade note nakad vinimay main 80 fisadi kaa hissaa rakhte hon vahaan sabase zyada istemaal vaale noton ko kuch samay ke liye achaanak band karnaa vidhwans hi hoga na! khaas taur par tab jabaki rigerv bank kii note mudran kshamtaayen simit or aaayaatit sadhano par nirbhar hai
 However, the total story of this chaos is that the government was to issue new design notes
 nakli note rokane kii koshishon par antarrashtriya sahmatiyon ke tahat rigerv bank ne surakshit dizin (blide lines, number chhapane kaa nayaa tarika) kii manjuuri lekar takanic jutaney kaa kaam pichley saal ke ant tak puraa kar liya tha
 The new notes were to be issued in November 2016 with the signature of the new RBI governor (after Rajan)
 isamen 2,000 ru
 There was also a new note of
 isi kram main nakli noton main pakistani haath hone kii pushti ke baad sarkaar ne karency ko surakshit banane kii takanic va sajo-saamaan ko lekar aayaat par nirbharta teen saal main 50 fisadi ghataane kaa nirnay bhi kiya tha
 For issuing new design notes, the old currency is not demonetized, rather the new notes are removed in the system respectively
 lekin sarkaar ne note band kar die, jiske kai nateezon kaa andaaj use khud bhi nahin tha
 Calculation of troubles 1
 bade note band hone se kul nakadi (16 lakh karod ru
 ) In about 14 lakh crores
 kam ho gaye yani ki ek jatke main adhikansh maang ko rokkar sarkaar ne taatkaalik mandi ko nyotaa de diya
 It takes a long time for the currency supply to normalize, so it will take more time to recover from recession and unemployment
 2
 No country imposes conditions on the use of its currency (legal tender) under normal conditions, for example, it can buy medicines but not bread
 yah karency sanchaalan ke siddhant ke khilaaf he
 This happens only when the country's credibility is sinking
 isliye videshi mudra bazaar main rupaya kamjor hua he
 3
 karency kaa prabandhan or nirnay rigerv bank karata he, is faisle se rigerv bank kii swaittata baadhit hui he
 Undoubtedly undermine the manner and preparation of this decision, but do not underestimate the power of black money
 dekha nahin ki ghoshnaa ke baad logon ko bamushkil do ghante mili the lekin usee dauraan sone kii dukaanon par kataren lag gayi
 Despite the closure of the note, gold and dollar transactions continued to take place at unprecedentedly high prices in the hawala market, which the Income Tax Department had to raid to stop
 kaale dhan ko rokane kii taaja koshishon kaa record bahut safal nahin rahaa he
 The mandate of PAN number in cash transactions on banks, property and jewelery has reduced deposits in banks and increased cash in the market
 kaala dhan ghoshnaa maafee scimen bahut utsaahi nattejey lekar nahin ain
 Ultimately, the government exercised the unexpected option, generating around three lakh crores
 kii kaali nakadi khatm hone kaa anumaan he
 Along with this, the Income Tax Department will always monitor the people going to the bank with cash to take new notes
 baharhaal, atm par dhakke khaane or paise hote hue udhaar par sabji lene ke dard ke baavjood is faisle se uthi gard ke paar dekhne kii koshish bhi kerani chahie, jahaan punarnirmaan kii ummid dikhti he
 Here is list 1 reconstruction
 bainkon ke liye pehle afat, phir raahat he
 55,000 crore in the State Bank alone in the first two days of commencement of bank operations after the decision was implemented
 jamaa hue, jabaki puri ek timahi main state bank kaa kul jamaa 76,000 karod ru
 it happens
 2
 Deposits from outstanding debts will return to the banks and bridge the capital deficit
 sarkaar kii chintaa ghategi or byaaj daren kam hone kii ummiden bandhengi
 3
 property, nakadi or kaale dhan kaa garh he
 Prices there may break 30 per cent on average
 sasta karj or sasti property vaastavik graahakon ko makaanon ke kareeb laakar maang kaa pahiyaa phir se ghuma sakate hai
 But keep in mind, in financial matters the destruction is fast and construction is slow, so the political-economic cost will have to be paid
 phir bhi agar takalif he to modi sarkaar se yah sawaal poochkar apni khiz mitie: nakad rajnatik chande par purna pabandi kab tak lagegi? bade note aane ke baad nakadi len-dein kii seemaa tay karne main deree to nahin hogi?sone kii kharid-jamkhori ko kaise rokenge?kheti kii kamai ke jariye kaale dhan kii dhulaai rokane kii kya yojana he?vipaksh ko apni urja uttar pradesh va punjab ke chunaavon kaa liye bachaani chahie, kyonki agar yahaan bijepi baari dhan bal or bhavy prachaar ke saath utari to phir maan lijiega bharat ke rajaneta aam logon kii keemat par kisi bhi tarah kii siyasat kar sakate hai
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi, while taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's interview, said that the journalist who was asking the question was answering himself

 Journalist Smita Prakash, who interviewed Rahul's statement, had lodged a strong objection

 Why is pseudo-liberal cool? Awaiting the response of the Editors Guild
 'bataa den ki samachar agency eenai ko die apane intervyuu main rafel maamle par ek sawaal ke jawaab main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha tha ki is maamle main unase koi sawaal nahin kiya gaya
 Rahul Gandhi made the same statement making the point that in which world does the Prime Minister live? All the questions related to Rafael Deal are being asked from him
 unhone kaha tha ki sansad main piem modi khud rafel par nahin bolte hai or vittamantri arun jetali unke bachaav main khokhli daleel dete hai

 Former Indian hockey players believe that it will be a miracle if the Indian men's hockey team makes it to the top four teams in the Olympics, but if it achieves positive results in the first match against strong Holland on July 30, then it will be eight The morale of the champion of the bar will increase

 If something like this happens, it will be a miracle
 unhone kaha, hamaare liye shuruyaat mahatvapurn hogi

 As the voting date draws closer, the leaders of both parties are throwing their full strength

 After this, BJP has also filed a complaint in the Election Commission against the Congress
 jab bijepi kii shikaayat par chunaav ayog ne jaanch kii, to baari sankhya main janata ke bich baante gaye cap or tashtaree baraamad hue
 When the candidate was questioned from Congress's Rajula seat Ambrose, he said that the party has not yet announced his name

 The intention of the lawyers was to stop the appointment of that judge

 He began to say his point and told the member that they had come to meet him because they know how serious corruption is in the judiciary
 supreme court ke jaj ne unhen bich main hi roka, harek ke chehre ko ghuraa or unase kaha, “kya nyaaypalika main vaaki bhrashtachar vyaapt he?” yachika dene aae vakeelon ke liye vah kshan tha jo unhen sanket de gaya ki ve kis vyavastha ke khilaaf khadey ho rahe hai
 The aura of power, privilege and protocol that the Indian judiciary has built around itself is now in danger
 99waan samvidhan sanshodhan or rashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog (engeesi) adhinium sansad ke donon sadanon main sirf teen din main sarvasammati se paas hone ke baad kanoon banane kii taiyaari main he
 Of course, this has created a furore in the judiciary and the executive as to who has the right to appoint judges in the Supreme Court and the High Court across the country
 is takaraav main ek ore hai nyaayadhish, jo duniya ke duusare deshon ke ulat apane saathiyon kaa chayan khud hi karte hai

 ”lekin varisht nyayavid fali nariman se lekar purv kanoon mantri kapil sibbal jaise kanoon se jude logon ne vidheyak ko nyaaypalika kii swatantraaa khatm karne vaala or samvidhan ke buniyadi dhaanche ko badal dene vaala qaraar diya
 In 1973, the Supreme Court ruled in the Keshavanand Bharti case that if the amendments of the constitution violated its basic structure, they would be nullified
 nariman bhi nae vidheyak ko ‘sweekaar na karne yogya’ maanate hai
 Sibal admits that judicial appointments need to be reformed, but he says, "the provisions of the bill show that the intentions of the government are questionable
" apane logon ko bhar kar sarkaar adaalaton par niyantran karnaa chaahati he
 According to the NJAC Bill, the Appointment Commission will have six members — three senior most judges of the Supreme Court, law ministers and two 'dignitaries' who will be selected by a committee
 isamen desh ke mukhya nyaayadhish, pradhanmantri or loksabhaa main vipaksh ke netaa bhi shaamil honge
 Among other drawbacks, the controversial aspect of the bill is that if any two members vote against a candidate, they will not be considered eligible for selection
 is tarah kisi bhi niyukti kii sweekruti ke liye 5-1 kaa faisla jaruri he
 The jurists argue that the Bill 1993 Justice J

 It is against the decision of a 9-member bench headed by Verma, which said that the appointment of judges would be done only with the consent of the judiciary to maintain its independence
 sibbal or nariman kaa tark he ki do sadasyon vaali vito vyavastha is visheshadhikaar kaa hanan he, kyonki nyaayik sadasyon par vito lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Apart from Sibal and Nariman, others including Ram Jethmalani say they will challenge it on the basis of 'infrastructure'
 ab lakh take kaa sawaal yah he ki supreme court isse sahamat hota he yaa nahin
 This case takes an interesting turn
 kai buniyadi samasyaendilli ke niti baag ilaake main bane daftar main varisht vakil or congress party ke pravaktaa abhishek manu singhvi engeesi vidheyak ke aasaani se paarit hone se utsaah se labarej najar aate hai
 They call it an 'important occasion' in the country's parliamentary history
 ve yah bataane se nahin chookte ki unki party nyaayik sudhaaron ke maamle main agrani he
 But do not even miss out on the provisions of the Bill which are wrong
 ve vah har cheez bataate hai jisaki vajah se samvidhan ke ‘buniyadi dhaanche’ main parivartan aa jayega or supreme court ise nirast kar saktaa he
 They argue against the provision of a two-member veto
 unka kahana he ki jajon kii niyukti kaa maamla samvidhan sanshodhan kaa hissaa hona chahie tha, ise neshnal jeudicial kamishan dwaara niyaman ke liye nahin choda janaa chahie tha
 He fears that according to provisions 5 and 6 of the Bill, the most senior judge will be appointed as Chief Justice, provided he is 'fit for it'
 ab yah upyuktata kya hogi, ise paribhaashit nahin kiya gaya he, isse manamaani kaa andeshaa bana rahata he
 Singhvi says, "not only is haste a waste, but it also creates serious constitutional flaws
 behatar hota, vidheyak kaa praaroop banaate samay saavdhaanee barti jaati
 Ironically, the time for debate is no longer there
 agar unhen itani adhik aapattiyaan thim to unki party ne donon sadanon main pesh kiye jate samay iskaa virodh kyon nahin kiya?bijepi ne kai takneekee khaamiyon sahit vidheyak ko paarit karwaane main jaldbaaji dikhaai he to congress ke iske puure samarthan kii vajah samaj main nahin aati, khaskar tab jab iske kanoonee visheshgyon ke paas vidheyak ke nirast ho sakane ke kaarnon kii kami nahin he
 By agreeing to support the bill "in principle", the Congress has lost the opportunity to be a responsible opposition, an opposition that debates a questionable or controversial bill
 in sawaalon ke jawaab kii hamaari chahat hamen kapil sibbal ke paas le jaati he
 He says, "it is clear that the government wants to fill its people in the judiciary
" hamane upie ke duusare kaarykaal main jo prastaav taiyaar kiya tha usamen do sadasyon ke vito kaa prastaav nahin tha
 This gives non-judicial members the authority to cancel the appointment
 or yah 1993 ke faisle ke khilaaf he
 The Left parties had also proposed an amendment in the Parliament asking to keep the number of members in the Commission to 7
 vah sadsy baar council kaa hona tha
 In this way the law fraternity would get a profit of 4-3 and work with a simple majority
 sipiem paulitabeuro sadsy seetaram yechuri kehete hai, “isse vyavastha ko paardarshee banane main madad milti or nyaaypalika kaa varchasv bhi bana rahata
 Parliament did not accept this amendment
 ”lekin kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ke paas jawaab he, “ayog ke chah main se teen sadsy jaj hi hai, isliye nyaaypalika kii sarvocchata khatm karne kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 We want a transparent system
 ” aage badaae se pehle jaan len ki vartmaan vyavastha kis tarah viksit hui, isamen khamiyaan kya hai or sudhaaron kii fori jarurat ke liye nyaaypalika khud kahaan tak jimmedaar he
 Collegium or Club? Article 124 of the Constitution states that a judge will be appointed in the Supreme Court after consulting the judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court
 isamen yah bhi kaha gaya he ki desh ke mukhya nyaayadhish kii niyukti ke alaava sari nyaayik niyuktiyon se pehle unki raay lee jaaegi
 Article 217 provides similar guidelines for judges of the High Court, except that the opinions of the Governor of the States and the Chief Justices of the High Court will also be taken in it
 yah vyavastha nae aaazaad bharat ke liye to anukool thi, jab mukhya nyaayadhish kuch nyaayadhishon kii suchi raashtrapati ke paas manjuuri ke liye bhej dete the
 Conflicts began to appear in the 1960s when the court rejected several laws of the Indira Gandhi government
 ye kanoon sarkaar ne apane samaajawaadee lakshya puure karne ke liye banaae the
 These included abolition of privipers and nationalization of banks
 inhen is aadhaar par nirast kiya gaya ki inase moulik adhikaron kaa ulanghan hota tha
 But the government rescinded the Supreme Court's decision by bringing constitutional amendments
 jab in sanshodhan ko chunauti di gai to supreme court ne 1973 main vah prasiddh faisla sunaaya ki sansad samvidhan main sanshodhan to kar sakati he lekin iske ‘buniyadi dhaanche’ main badlaav nahin kar sakati
 In 1975, when the Indira Gandhi government implemented Emergency, the judiciary became its first victim
 jo nyaayadhish sarkaar ke chahete nahin the, unka tabadalaa kar diya gaya

 The equations changed during the Narasimha Rao government

 It was formalized in 1998 when the Judges Collegium's structure and functioning were clarified in the Judges-3 case
 in varshon main kai prashasnic sudhaaron ke suzav aae, lekin yah vyavastha tab se hi vajood main he
 The ground effect of this was that the collegium, especially the Chief Justice of the country, became the master of the rest of the judicial system, senior judges of an elite class entering the collegium as if sitting on a high chair
 unki chapalusee karnaa jaruri ho gaya, unki pasand par sawaal uthaanaa gunaah
 Jurists say judges of lower courts and high courts began to make shrill remarks that would make headlines or deliver decisions that would have brought them to the notice of collegium members
 kanoonee visheshgyon kaa tark he ki isse jo vyavastha saamne ai, vah na to paardarshee thi, na pratibhashali ummidavaar saamne aa pate

 There was also the perception that the present judges are accustomed to constantly monitor the cases and are unaware of the economic growth appetite of the new India

 On 2 February 2012, the Supreme Court canceled 122 telecom licenses for their involvement in the 2G scam

 The judges stated that they were “states and declared that natural resources could be allocated only through auctions

 Last October, the court said that the bureaucrats should get a minimum period of assurance and a civil service board should control all transfers
 ek varisht vakil kaa kahana he, “ye aadesh sabit karte hai ki adaalat ne un maamalon main bhi dakhal dena shuru kar diya, jinase ise pare rahanaa chahie tha
 "this brings up two important questions: one is that the legislature and executive and some jurists have an opinion on the matter that the current system needs to be reformed
 aise main karypalika kaa palada baari rakhana kya iskaa samaadhaan he? doosraa yah ki kya rajyon kii manjuuri ke baad sanshodhano ko adaalat main chunauti di jaati he to kya ye vaid rahenge?purv pradhan nyaayadhish ve

 He says, "as far as this issue is concerned, the 1993 decision is still going on firmly
 sansad jis cheez par gaur kar sakati thi vah thi samvidhan kaa sanshodhan karne se pehle isaki samiksha karti
 Without review — the basic structure — as the court has interpreted — is the same as stated in the 1993 judgment

 unka tark he ki colegium vyavastha siddhant rup main to thik he, lekin aaj jis rup main kaam kar rahi he, usase samasya paidaa ho rahi he
 He says, "the entire system needs to be transparent and easily accessible
 janata ko pataa hona chahie ki kise chunaa ja rahaa he or uski kya vajah hai
 Passing constitutional amendments that change infrastructure is not a solution to the problem
 ”lekin har rajnatik dal main badlaav ke pairokaron kaa maananaa he ki nyaayik sudhaaron ko vyapak jan samarthan hasil he, lihaaja nayaa kanoon antat lagu ho jayega

 Sher Singh, one of the elders who has shifted from Vasantkunj to Narela Old Age Home, has died
 vah 55 saal ke the
 In fact, many of the elders were evicted from Vasantkunj's farm house after the lease expired and were on the road for the last two days
 media main khabar aane ke baad sarkaar ne in bujurgon kii sud lee thi or inhen narela ke old age home main shift karavaaya tha
 It is reported that Sher Singh was already ill and had fallen while being shipped on Wednesday
 tippaniyan Significantly, 55-year-old Sher Singh was among the 135 people rejected from his family who were shifted from Vasant Kunj to Narela's Old Age Home on Wednesday
 ye ve log hai, jinhen pehle to parivaar ne nahin apanaaya or phir jis ghar main ve rah rahe the, vah bhi chhin gaya
 It is worth noting that the place where these helpless people have been shifted to Narela is a government house built for beggars in Delhi, which was closed for many years
 aise main yahaan jaahirataur par in laachaar biimaar logon ke liye jaruri intjaam nahin hai
 After the news came in the media, the government had taken care of these elders and shifted them to the old age home of Narela
 khabar he ki sher singh pehle se hi biimaar chal rahe the or buudhvaar ko shift hone ke dauraan vah gir gaye the
 The comments gauratlab he ki 55 saal ke sher singh apane parivaar se thukraae gaye un 135 logon main shaamil the, jinhen buudhvaar ko vasant kunj se narela ke old age home main shift kiya gaya tha
 These are people who were not adopted by the family first and then the house in which they were staying was also snatched away
 gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki narela main jis jagah in laachaar logon ko shift kiya gaya he vah dilli main bhikhaariyon ke liye banaaya gaya sarkari ghar he, jo ki kai saalon se band padaa tha
 In such a situation, there are obviously no necessary arrangements for these helpless sick people

 jabaki bijepi bhi congress ke 10 or jedies ke teen vidhayakon se lagaataar sampark saadhe hue he

 Amar Singh replied to the question of journalists that he felt that Samajwadi Party could run without Amar Singh, but without Azam Khan, it is difficult to run the party
 gauratlab he ki ajam khan kaaphi samay se party netritv se naaraaz chal rahe hai
 Amar Singh and Jayaprada were believed to be the reason for Azam's displeasure

 rail mantralay ne railway se ritair ho chuke karmchaariyon ko dobaaraa kaam par rakhane kii adhiktam umr 62 saal se badhaakar 65 saal kar di he
 The validity of retiring employees has been extended from 14 September 2018 to 1 December 2019
 railway karmchaariyon kii sabase badi union ol india railway mens federation ne mantralay ke is faisle kaa virodh kiya he
 The federation says that a large number of young people are moving around the country unemployed
 aise main ritred karmchaariyon ko dobaaraa kaam main rakhane kii skim kahaan tak jaij he
 Railway Board has written a letter to all the divisions of the Railways in this regard that the Divisional Railway Manager will be authorized to hire retired employees
 railway is maamle ko publicity degi
 Its information will be put on the website of all railways
 is skim ke tahat ritred karmchaariyon ko sefti related ritairement skim ke tahat cover nahin diya janaa chahie
 Retired employees should have their safety records checked before re-employment
 saath hi saath duusari oparational jaruraton ko bhi dhyaan main rakhaa janaa chahie
 The letter wrote that retired railway employees hired on re-employment should be paid a pension after deducting the pension from their last salary
 aise dobaaraa rakhe gaye ritred karmchaariyon ko tab turant discharge kar diya jayega
 When the selected candidates from RRB will join in their place
 gauratlab he railway main karmchaariyon kii kami ke chalate ritair karmchaariyon ko dobaaraa naukari par rakhe jane kii skim 16 oktober 2017 ko laai gai thi
 The validity of this scheme was till 14 September 2018
 ab railway board ne ritred karmchaariyon ko dobaaraa kaam par rakhane kii skim ko badhaakar 1 disambar 2019 tak kar diya he
 Recruitment of railway employees on a large scale, General Secretary of Railway Federation, Shiv Gopal Mishra said in a special conversation with 'aaj Tak' that Railways should recruit employees on a large scale
 railway main hajaaron kii sankhya main pad khaali hai
 In such a situation, the extension of the scheme of retiring the retired employees shows that by not giving employment to the youth of the country, the government officials want to give benefit to their vassal subordinates
 prabhavit ho kaamkaaj kaa vaataavaranaunhone kaha jis tarah se ritred karmchaariyon ko dobaaraa kaam par rakhane kii adhiktam umr ko 62 saal se badhaakar 65 saal kii gai he
 He is absolutely wrong
 kyonki railway kaa kaam aisa he, jisamen police shaareerik dakshata or maansik chusti chahie
 The efficiency of this method is not lost among retired railway employees

 Sushil Modi took a dig at Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and said that Rahul Gandhi who had gone abroad for a long holiday just before the first budget session of the NDA government and whose party could not even tell the reason of his leader's absence in the House, Today's winter session is a big concern

 Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) of India Today analyzed Modi's speeches during the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha election campaign and found how the focus of his content changed
 modi ke bhaashanon main kaise jor ‘garib’ kii jagah ‘chaukeedaar’ par aa gaya
 For analysis, we took five pre-election speeches of Modi in 2014 and 2019
 jaise ki 2014 main patna, varanasi, dilli, chennai or meerut
 Similarly in 2019, Bhagalpur, Kendrapara, Moradabad, Panaji and Buniyadpur
 DIU ne apane vishleshan main kya paaya?badalata fokadgar 2014 kii baat kii jaae to pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bhaashanon main khaasaa jor ‘garib’ shabd par rahaa
 The word then appeared 55 times in his speeches
 lekin 2019 kii baat kii jaae to pradhanmantri ke bhaashanon main ‘garib’ shabd kaa zikr 44 baar hi hua
 But 'poor' remained the second most spoken word in the Prime Minister's speeches, despite decreasing frequency
 2014 main modi ke bhaashanon main ‘garib’ ke alaava ‘congress’ (43), ‘bijepi’ (31), ‘gujarat’ (28), ‘kisaan’ (28) or ‘vikaas’ (25) sabase zyada bole jane vaale shabdon main shaamil rahe
 If we talk about PM Modi's speeches in 2019, he used the word 'chowkidar' the most (106 times)
 march main pradhanmantri ne vipaksh kii ore se bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaae jane ke baad twitor par ‘main bhi chaukeedaar’ campagne shuru kiya
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi is using the slogan 'chowkidar Chor Hai' in most speeches during his party's campaign
 ajtak ke saath ek exclusive intervyuu main piem narendra modi ne kaha ki vipaksh kii ore se unki prishthbhumi kaa makhul udaae jane kii vajah se unhen chaukeedaar campagne shuru karnaa padaa
 Apart from 'chowkidar' and 'garib', Modi's speeches in 2019 include 'modi' (42), 'congress' (38), 'vikas' (31), 'kisan' (23) and 'BJP' (21)
 The most spoken words were kis shabd kaa istemaal gata?2014 loksabhaa chunaav main modi apane bhaashanon main vikaas ke gujarat model par vishesh bal dete the
 That is why he used the word 'vikas' 25 times and 'gujarat' 28 times
 vahiin 2019 ke unke bhaashanon main ‘vikaas’ kaa 31 baar or ‘gujarat’ kaa sirf ek baar hi ullekh hua
 In 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the issues of farmers topped Modi's speeches
 2014 ke chunaav bhaashanon main modi ne ‘kisaan’ shabd kaa istemaal 28 baar or 2019 main 23 baar kiya
 'poverty' and 'unemployment' are issues that the BJP has not mentioned in detail in its 2019 election manifesto
 inkaa piem modi ke haalia bhaashanon main bhi zyada ullekh nahin hua
 In 2014, Modi mentioned the word 'poverty' 19 times in his speeches while in 2019 he mentioned it only 3 times
 sanyogvash vipaksh kaa is chunaav ke liye garibi hi kendriya mudda he or wo baar-baar apni nunatam aay yojana (nyaay) kaa zikr kar ise oochaal rahaa he
 Similarly, the word 'unemployment' came up 6 times in Modi's 2014 speeches, but in 2019 the word remained absent
 abhi haal main aisi report ai thim ki berogari aal-time apane sarvocch str par he
 But PM Modi had rejected such claims in an interview given to Aaj Tak and said that he has a strategy ready for the creation of new jobs
 pakistan or aatankwadamodi ne ‘pakistan’ or ‘aatankwaad’ kaa 2014 or 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ke bhaashanon main donon baar zikr kiya lekin sandarbh alag-alag tha
 In 2014, the Prime Minister mentioned 'terrorism' only once in his speeches
 piem modi ne kaha tha ki wo anek aatankwaadi ghatnaon ko lekar chakit hai
 On 2019, the words 'terror', 'terrorist' and 'terrorism' were mentioned 24 times in the pm's speeches
 2014 ke chunavi bhaashanon main modi ne chaar baar kaha tha ki pakistan bharat ke liye pareshaani khadi kar rahaa he
 In 2019, the word 'pakistan' appeared 15 times in the Prime Minister's speeches
 ‘pakistan’ or ‘aatankwaad’ donon shabd ek saath modi ke 2019 ke bhaashanon main aae, lekin 2014 main aisa nahin tha
 Modi's reference to BJP is more interesting that while the use of the word 'modi' in the speeches of PM Modi has increased in five years, the mention of 'BJP' has decreased
 2014 main modi ne ‘bijepi’ shabd kaa istemaal 33 baar or ‘modi’ kaa 11 baar kiya
 However, in 2019, PM mentioned 'modi' 42 times and 'BJP' 24 times
 piem modi ne 2014 or 2019 donon baar ‘congress’ shabd kaa istemaal ‘bijepi’ se zyada baar kiya, lekin frequency paanch saal main ghat gai
 In 2014, the mention of 'congress' came 45 times in Modi's speeches, while it decreased to 38 times in 2019
 2014 main ‘congress’ modi ke bhaashanon main bole jane vaala doosraa top shabd tha jo 2019 main chauthe number par aa gaya
 The first three places were 'chowkidar', 'garib' and 'modi'

 Since then, there were speculations that Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav will hold the victory chariot of Narendra Modi in UP
 shanivaar ko aupchaarik rup se mayawati or akhilesh saath aa gaye hai
 Just before the Lok Sabha elections, the alliance of SP and BSP is a big political event
 akhilesh or mivati ke saath aane se dalit- obisi gathjod taqatvar to banegaa hi musalmaan voter bhi nirnaayak bhoomika main najar aaenge
 This alliance increased the possibility of solidarity between backward-dalit and Muslims
 jo kahin na kahin bijepi ke liye badi chunauti hogi
 Political experts believe that the first Muslim vote, divided between SP-BSP, will now directly strengthen the alliance
 yani pichde-dalit or musalamaanon kii tikdi raajnneetik taur par vining combination banaati dikh rahi he
 In the decisive role on 27 seats, 19 in UP according to the 2011 Muslim Census
 5 fisadi musalmaan voter hai
 The province has a decisive population of Muslims in 38 districts and 27 Lok Sabha seats
 vahiin 125 vidhansabha siton par muslimon kii pakad tagdi he
 It is believed that before the Mayawati and Akhilesh alliance, Muslim voters had a dilemma
 haalanki ab tasviir badalati najar aa rahi he
 Talking to 'aaj Tak', many Muslim voters have directly announced their support for the coalition
 sapa-basapa or bhaajapa main hogi kaante kii takkarsaal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav or 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ne muslim voton main sendhamari kii thi
 About 10 per cent of Muslims voted for the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections and around 17 per cent in the assembly elections
 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko 42
 63 per cent, 22 to SP
 35 fisadi or basapa ko 19
 77 percent of the votes were received
 agar sapa or basapa kaa vot pratishat jod diya jaae to akda 42
 Reaches 12 percent
 vahiin, vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko 40 fisadi (312 seat), sapa ko 22 fisadi (47 seat) or basapa ko 22 fisadi (17 seat) vot mili the
 That is, SP and BSP got 44 percent votes
 loksabhaa upachunaav main gathbandhan agein donon chunaav ke baad hue upachunaavon main sapa or basapa saath aa gaye the
 The result was that the BJP had to face a crushing defeat in its stronghold
 phulpur upachunaav main sapa-basapa ko 47 fisadi or bijepi ko 39 fisadi, kairana main sapa-basapa ko 51 fisadi or bijepi ko 46 fisadi, gorakhpur main sapa-basapa ko 49 fisadi or bijepi ko 47 fisadi vot mili the
 Muslims said, while talking to 'ajatak' who will vote for the alliance, Younus Badre, who hails from Uttar Pradesh, said that they will vote for the alliance, it will defeat the BJP
 haji munsif ali rizvi ne kaha ki gathbandhan sahi samay par aayaa he
 We will vote for it and not Congress
 vahiin, mohammad sakir ne kaha ki congress ko liye bagaiyr bijepi nahin haraa paaenge
 Comparison of Muslim vote sharing is also true that despite the large Muslim population in UP, not a single Muslim parliament could reach the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 raajnneetik jaankaar maanate hai ki 2014 main espi-bispi or congress ke bich musalmaan voton ke bantwaare kii vajah se raajnneetik nuksaan hua, lekin ab isbaar upi ke do taqatwar dal espi-bispi ek kheme main he- aise main musalamaanon kaa vot pehle kii tulana main kam bantega mumkin ye bhi he ye bante hi naa
 Issues affecting Muslim votes - Triple talaq - Ram temple - Violence in the name of Go Raksha - Sorting of Urdu teachers will be able to break the BJP? However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tried to give strength to Muslim women by enacting a law on triple talaq 
 raajnneetik taur par ise bijepi kii muslim mahilaon ko apane paksh main karne kaa daanv mana gaya

 Industrialist Ratan Tata has criticized the government's inconsistent and biased policies, saying that such policies are against the old leaders Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi's policies to make India a self-supporting nation
 unhenne saath saath yah bhi kaha ki bade theke dene kii niti main aparrshita, anupaalan ke saath majaak or kshamta kii kasuti ke durupyog se tata samooh ko baar baar nuksaan hota rahaa he
 In an interview with a private TV news channel, Tata said that from the point of view of investors, there is a constant uncertainty in the government's policies
 ‘‘haa mujhe aisa lagata he, hameshaa se mujhe yahi lagata he or kai baar main main khulkar yah kah chukaa hum
 The government is not behind such policies, some selfishness is working behind them
 ’niryaat or prakritik sansadhano ke istemaal ke bare main unhone kaha ki ham kai varshon se ham shri nehru or shrimati gandhi kii swaavlamban kii rashtriya kasuti kii nitiyon se ulat chal rah hai, jabaki vinirmaan ke kai kshetron main ham duniya main kisi bhi desh kaa muqabla kar sakate hai
 Tata said that he has often told policy makers that national resources are an important issue
 tata ne kaha,‘ par aise vishyon main jahaan centre or rajyon donon kaa adhikaar chalata he, kuch khaas nahin ho paata
 He denied reports that his group had given money to former Jharkhand Chief Minister Madhu Koda to get mining concessions
 tata ne kaha ki yah baat bilkul galat he
 Being the chairman of Tata Steel, i can say that nothing has happened directly or indirectly
 hamen kodaa ke samay koi patta nahin mila
 The head of the Tata group admitted that he had also heard the discussion of these allegations
 unhone kaha ki pravartan agenciyaan ne is bare main tata steel ko bulaayaa bhi tha
 We have given them the same answer
 yah puche jane par ki kya unhen doorsanchaar kshetra main utarane par ab koi dukh ho rahaa he to, tata ne kaha
 Yes unhone kaha, haa, nitiyon main sthirataa na hone ke kaaran
 
 yaa jo bhedbhaav kiya jaataa he uski vajah se
 
 kai baar mujhe dukh hota he par yah ek bada acha kshetra he
 In response to another question, he said that the telecom sector is an example where the policies of the government have not been implemented in the manner or spirit as it should have been
 unhone kaha, ‘kai baar kuch logon ko phayda pahunchane ke liye nitiyon main sanshodhan kiya gaya
 He said that usually there are some interests in the midst of changing the policy
 haalanki unhone saaf kiya ki aaj tak doorsanchaar kshetra main unke samooh se kisi ne paisa nahin maanga
 He said that policies in the telecom sector were changed many times so that a particular person could benefit
 shuru main yah ho saktaa he is kshetra main sarkari companiyon ke jame hone kii vajas se hua ho
 Then it continued to benefit one class or another
 unhone kaha,‘ saamanyat: har badlaav, har bhatkaav ke peeche koi na koi nihit swathry sakriy he
 He said that earlier policies used to be followed but today the interpretation of any policy has become very blurred
 unhone kaha,‘‘ aise main yadi aap kuch kahana chaahate hai to doosraa uski ek alag dhang kii vyakhya dene lagegaa vah aisi besangi or uljigi ki aap us baithak se yah sochate hue uthenge ki main to yah kar hi nahin paaunga
 In this context, Tata referred to his attempt to re-enter the civil aviation sector and said how the policy changes during the era of Narasimha Rao government to Deve Gowda and Gujral government
