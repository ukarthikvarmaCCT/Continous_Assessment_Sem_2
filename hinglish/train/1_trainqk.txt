 tri yani telecom regulatory athurity of india ke nae disha nirdeshon main kaha gaya he ki ab televijan channel ek ghante main 12 minute se adhik ke vigyaapan nahin dikhaa sakenge

 TRAI has rung the death knell for news channels
 news channel jivit rahane ke liye vigyapanon par nirbhar hai, graahakon se paisa nahin ke baraabar miltaa he
 They should understand that the news channels show advertisements in compulsion and not their own will
 agar news channelon par pratibandh lagaaya gaya to phir unka astitv khatre main pad jayega
 Setting any limit for advertisements will directly affect the revenue of the channels
 pehle se hi mushkilon se jujh rahe is kaarobaar kii haalat or zyada kharaab ho jaaegi
 Joy Today Chakraborty, CEO of TV Today, said, "we are not opposed to implementing the 12-minute obligation but we want it to be done in a planned manner, not in a jolt
" live programing ke liye hamen vigyapanon par nirbhar hona padataa he
 We will raise this issue with the government

 On this issue, Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni says that it will be discussed with all the parties
 tri ke is disha nirdesh se jahaan news channelon main khalabali much gai he vahiin vigyaapan jagat bhi achambhe main he
 The implementation of the new rule will have a huge impact on consumers

 Dhoni said that like the second ODI played in Delhi, the team had to bear the brunt of losing wickets
 dhoni ne match ke baad kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki yadi hamaare wicket bache hote to ham lakshya hasil kar sakate the
 It was also a match like Delhi, where we lost consecutive wickets
 ' unhone kaha, 'yah wicket shaam ko ballebaaji karne ke liye kaaphi acha tha or match aage badhane ke saath dhimaa hota ja rahaa tha
 The new ball was still coming on the bat in the light of light, but it was not easy to bat with the ball being old
 ' Dhoni landed Akshar Patel at number five, while Manish Pandey came at number six and Kedar Jadhav at number seven

 Performance: We were given the 3GB RAM variant of this smartphone for review
 yadi aap stock android yujar hai to is smartphone MIUI skin kaaphi nayaa hoga

 Also, its display is also very attractive in terms of color
 haalanki agar gaming ke shaukin hai to ye smartphone ho saktaa he aapako raas naa aae
 Because we got a little frustrated playing the game

 We have tried this smartphone with games like Angry Birds 2 and Temple Run 2
 jahaan tak bydaree kii baat he to ye smartphone saamaanya upyog main kaaphi acha saport detaa he
 However, for more use, such as watching videos or listening to songs and using the net, you will definitely feel the need to charge in the evening after charging in the morning
 iske alaava iske fingerprint scinar kii baat karen to ye bhi kaaphi fast he or isse photose bhi clic kiye ja sakate hai
 Camera: It is more important to talk about the camera section here because the company has designed it specifically for selfie
 yugers ko iske front or back donon camaron ke saath instagram jaise filters milenge

 iske front camere kii baat karen to selfi ke liye isamen 16 megapixl kaa camera diya gaya he, jo lite main vaakai shandaar parformens detaa he
 But when we wanted to click a low-light photo from it, we did not get the desired result
 haalanki andhere main photo clic karne ke liye isamen flash diya gaya he uske baavjood lo lite main nois zyada dekhne ko mila
 Likewise, its primary camera also performs brilliantly in light, but its performance in low light is also not fun
 to hamaare rivyuu ke hisaab se company ko lo lite main camere ko behatar banane ke liye vishesh taur par kaam karnaa chahie
 Verdict: In our opinion, if you want to buy this selfie smartphone for selfie clicking, then you may be disappointed
 haalanki is smartphone kii baaki khubiyaan aapako niraash nahin karengi, chaahe software kii baat ho yaa phir luk or disple kii
 There may be some problem with the battery, but you can forget it
 yani selfi ke shaukin nahin he to is smartphone ko haathon haath liya ja saktaa he

 mishan shilong kii shuruyaat vaasanic kii pahal thi
 He has been put in charge of the party's north-east and wanted to build his credibility by forming an alliance
 lekin bhaajapa ke hemanth biswa sarama ne sarkaar gathan ke maamle main unhen chaka diya, to teenon chupchaap dilli laut aae
 Not a good day for the Congress
 *** As soon as the MCD elections come closer, the political mercury of Delhi is also rising, where the race to put each other in political parties has started
 isi kavayad ke tahat bijepi ne aam aadmi party ko gherne kii taiyaariyaan shuru kar di hai
 For this, the Bharatiya Janata Party has given its command to the Yuva Morcha, under which the Yuva Morcha activists will make a noise against the AAP through hoardings and videos and will remind people of the 70 promises of the AAP
 iske liye bijepi yuva morcha ke kaaryakarta AAP ke style main hi use gherenge
 For this, BJP workers will stand on red lights in different areas of Delhi with a plank, which will mention the promises of the AAP
 iske saath saath hi auto or taxi ke madhyam se bhi kejariwal sarkaar kii pole kholegi
 Apart from this, hoardings will be placed around major markets and educational institutions of Delhi and on each hoarding there will be a picture of a common citizen, giving a promise and reality of the government
 isi tarah party kai chote-chote poster bhi lagaaegi
 At the same time, a video film is also being made on the investigation of the promises of the Kejriwal government, in which BJP workers will organize programs in different places of Delhi and show that video
 iske saath hi dilli bijepi adhyakshamanoj tiwarike reality check vaali bhi video dikhaai jaaengi, jisamen tiwari dilli kii alag-alag jhuggiyon main raat guzari thi
 The BJP is trying to bring along auto, taxi and e-rickshaw drivers considered Kejriwal supporters
 iske liye bijepi ne 100 se zyada i-rickshaw kaa istemaal karne kii yojana banaai he, jo dilli ke alag-alag ilaakon main ghumkar kejariwal sarkaar ke vaadon kii hakeekat bataaengi
 The distance between Akhilesh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav has increased so much that there is no scope of compromise on any issue, the fact that the Chief Minister was not even stagnant now that the faction has started on both the grand alliance
 
 akhilesh yadav ke saamne hi unke mantri shailendra yadav urf lalai ne saarvajanik rup se mahagathbandhan ke shivpal yadav ke prayaason ko jamkar aade haathon liya
 Actually the program was about to start 24 hours of electricity in the entire state from today, but the official program became political in the same way
 shuruyaat bijli rajya mantri or akhilesh ke kareebi shailendra yadav urf lalai ne kii, jinhone apane 8 minute ke bhaashan main ishaaron main hi sahi lekin shivpal yadav or mahagathbandhan banane ke unke prayaason ko khub khari-khoti sunai
 Minister Shailendra alias Lalai Yadav compared Akhilesh to Kohinoor diamonds, compared Akhilesh Yadav to Kohinoor diamonds while Shivpal Yadav's attempts to form a mahagathbandhan by adding stones in front of diamonds
 lalai yadav ne kaha aaj kuch logakohinoorheere ko dabaane ke liye pattharon ko jutaney kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Kohinoor will remain Kohinoor, gather 100 stones and no two can compare Kohinoor
 lalai ne kaha chaahe kitne bhi pathar ikatthe kar lo kohinoor kohinoor hi rahegaa
 It is clear that the point was towards Shivpal Yadav's efforts where he is seen taking initiative to form a grand alliance in UP
 shivpal yadav ki ye wo pahal he jisamen akhilesh yadav kii sahmati nahin dikhti
 Minister Shailendra alias Lalai Yadav did not stop here, comparing Akhilesh to Ganga water, he also compared Akhilesh Yadav to Ganges water
 unhone akhilesh yadav kii tulana gangaajal se karne liye gyani gel singh ke us prasiddh vaakya ko kaha jisamen unhone kaha tha ki ganga ke kinare rahane vaale log ganga kii keemat nahin jaanate jo hajaaron kilometre se aate hai or gangaajal le jate hai wo isaki keemat jaanate hai, na jane uttar pradesh ke log is gangaajal kii keemat kab janenge
 This hint of a clean minister can also be towards Mulayam Singh
 bijepi netaa ke bayaan kaa diya hawalalalai ne aage bijepi ke ek bade netaa ke bayaan kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki wo party jo hamaari vichaardhaara ke bilkul ulat hai uske ek bade netaa ne kaha he ki jis tarah kaa kaam akhilesh yadav kar rahe hai wo ek din is desh ke sarvocch netaa banenge
 However, on November 5, Samajwadi Party is going to celebrate its silver jubilee program, on the pretext of this program, an attempt is being made to form a grand alliance, although Shivpal Yadav is trying to make this effort, so Akhilesh Khema neither is excited about it
 He only wants to pay attention
 akhilesh ke mantri ke bayaan se ye saaf ho gaya ki shivpal ke is pahal par jabatak akhilesh kii muhar nahin lagati tabatak mahagathbandhan kii is koshish ko shaayad hi koi gambhirtha se le

 Before the issues and the politics of plan of action are discussed, it is necessary to have a discussion about the candidates as well
 aam aadmi party ke saurabh bharadwaj yahaan ke maujuuda vidhayak hai
 Even though the AAP government in the state lasted for 49 days, the matter of development is not limited to running the government alone
 bharadwaj kejariwal sarkaar main mantri bhi rah chuke hai
 Against the AAP candidate, the Congress has nominated Sharmistha Mukherjee, the daughter of President Pranab Mukherjee, from this constituency
 sharmishtha raajnneeti main nai hai, lekin unka maananaa he ki vah muddon kii samaj rakhti hai or yah unke liye viraasat main mili saugat he
 With the announcement of Sharmishtha's name, the election of this posh area of delhi becomes a bit more important, because obviously this area is going to be the subject of much discussion in the event of defeat or victory
 yah baat bijepi bhi samajhati he isliye centre kii satta par asin or dilli kii satta main bahumat kaa daawa karne vaali is party ne apane sthaneey netaa rakesh gulia par vishwaas jataayaa he
 The party last fielded Ajay Malhotra, the son of VK Malhotra, who finished second
 party ko vishwaas he ki gulia jeet ke ruke hue rath ko manzil tak pahunchaayenge
 According to some local people, Guliya has an upper hand, because both he and his wife have once been corporators
 raajnneeti ke cockhare main kisi bhi nirvachan kshetra ke liye nigam parshad ek party ke liye vah pehali seedhi he, jo sidhe taur par janata se judaa hota he

 vah bataate hai ki unhone paune do karod rupee kii laagat se siver nirmaan kaa kaary shuru karwaane kaa jimmaa liya, lekin emsidi iske liye parmishan nahin de rahi
 He describes the introduction of CCTV cameras in the name of security as his achievement

 There are vehicles on both sides of the road, which causes problems in movement
 gadiyon kii sankhya badhane ke kaaran gaadi khadi karne ke liye aksar jagah nahin milti
 Residents of Greater Kailash also count the BRT as their biggest problem
 unka aarope he ki 'aap' ne pehle vaada kiya ki vah biarti ko khatm kar degi, lekin sarkaar banane ke baad vah ise khatm karne kii bajaay behatar banane ke prayaas main jute gai
 Mithilesh, who lives in Chirag Delhi, says water is the main problem in his area
 congress ke shasankaal se lekar aam aadmi party kii sarkaar tak kisi ne bhi is ore koi pukhta prayaas nahin kiya
 People also include pucca sewer construction in their main problems
 logon kaa kahana he ki greater kailash kehane ko posh ilaaka he, lekin barsaat ke mausam yahaan kisi narak jaisi sthiti rahati he
 Factor of victory: Saurabh Bharadwaj is a youth leader
 anubhav kii kami he, lekin kaam ko lekar spasht raay rakhte hai

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne buudhvaar subah blog likhakar congress par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa, unhone vanshavaad-loktantr-sansad samet ke kai muddon par congress ko gheraa
 The Prime Minister counted that many things have been done during his tenure that were not done during the Congress governments
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne likhaa ki immergency lagu kar congress ne sabit kiya ki vah ek vansh kii raksha karne ke liye kis had tak ja sakati he
 The Prime Minister wrote that in 2014 the countrymen were deeply saddened by the fact that why we all have a lovely India in the Frazile Five countries? Why instead of any positive news, only news such as corruption, wrong benefits to the loved ones and nepotism used to be the headline
 tab aam chunaav main deshavaasiyon ne bhrashtachar main dubi us sarkaar se mukti paane or ek behatar bhavishya ke liye matdaan kiya tha, varsh 2014 kaa janadesh aitihaasik tha
 For the first time in the history of India, a non-dynastic party had an absolute majority
 jab koi sarkaar‘family First’kii bajaae‘india First’kii bhaavana ke saath chalati he to yah uske kaam main bhi dikhaai detaa he
 The PM wrote that it is the effect of the policies and functioning of our government that in the last five years, India has joined the top economies of the world
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane blog main sansad ke kaamkaaj, press kii abhivyakti, samvidhan-nyaayalay or sarkari sansthaanon ke mudde par congress ko gheraa
 He said that there was a non-dynastic government in the Lok Sabha, because the work was done while the Rajya Sabha could not work because there was a ruckus
 piem ne apane blog main immergency kaa mudda bhi uthaaya
 Significantly, 'main Bhi Chowkidar' Campan started by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also made a mark on social media, according to the report released on Twitter recently, this campaign has beaten the watchman Chor Hai on social media
 padhein pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa puraa blogwah 2014 kii garmiyon ke din the, jab deshavaasiyon ne nirnaayak rup se mat dekar apana faisla sunaaya:parivaratantr ko nahin, loktantr ko chunaa
 He chose development, not destruction

 Priority was given to opportunity, not inhibition

 In 2014, the countrymen were deeply saddened that why the lovely India of ours is in the Frazile Five countries? Why instead of any positive news, only news such as corruption, wrong benefits to the loved ones and nepotism used to be the headline
 tab aam chunaav main deshavaasiyon ne bhrashtachar main dubi us sarkaar se mukti paane or ek behatar bhavishya ke liye matdaan kiya tha
 The 2014 mandate was historic
 bharat ke itihaas main pehali baar kisi gaiyr vanshavaadi party ko purna bahumat mila tha
 When a government runs with the spirit of 'india First' rather than 'family First', it is also reflected in its work
 It is the effect of our government's policies and functioning that in the last five years, India has become one of the top economies of the world

 Homes have been provided to the homeless
 garibon ko muft chikitsa kii suvidha mili he or yuvaaon ko behatar shiksha or rojgaar ke avasar mili hai
 Today, this fundamental change in every field means that there is a government in the country, for which the institutions of the country are paramount
 bharat ne dekha he ki jab bhi vanshavaadi raajnneeti haaavee hui to usne desh kii sansthaaon ko kamjor karne kaa kaam kiya
 Parliament: The total productivity of the 16th Lok Sabha stood at 85% brilliantly, which is more than the 15th Lok Sabha
 vahiin 2014 se 2019 ke bich rajyasabha kii productivity 68% rahi
 While the Lok Sabha's productivity stood at 89% in the interim budget session, it was only 8% in the Rajya Sabha
 donon sadanon kii productivity ke in aankadon kaa kya arth he, ise desh bhalee-bhaanti jaanata he
 It becomes clear that whenever there is a large number of non-dynastic party in the House, it naturally has a tendency to do more work
 deshavaasiyon ko yah poochna chahie ki aakhir rajyasabha ne utana kaam kyon nahin kiya, jitna loksabhaa main hua? ve koun si shaktiyaan thim, jinhone sadan ke bheetar itnaa hangaamaa kiya or kyon?press or abhivyakti:vanshavaad ko badhaava dene vaali partiyaan kabhi bhi swatantra or nirbhik patrakarita ke saath sahaj nahin rahi hai
 No wonder, the first constitutional amendment brought by the Congress government was to ban free speech
 free press kii pahchaan yahi he ki wo satta ko sach kaa aainaa dikhaae, lekin use ashleel or asabhy kii pahchaan dene kii koshish kii gai
 The same happened during the UPA regime, when they brought a law according to which if you posted anything 'outrageous' you would be put in jail
 upie ke taqatvar mantriyon ke bete ke khilaaf ek twit bhi nirdosh aadmi ko jail main daal saktaa tha
 a few days ago, the country also saw the shadow of that fear when some youth were arrested for expressing their feelings during an event in Karnataka where the Congress is in power
 lekin, main unhen bataanaa chahta hum ki kisi bhi tarah kii dhamkee se jamini hakeekat nahin badalane vaali he
 Even if they forcefully try to curb freedom of expression, people's perception of Congress will not change

 Hearing the hasty radio address given by the then Prime Minister, it is clear to what extent the Congress can go to protect a dynasty
 apatkaal ne desh ko raaton-raat jail kii kothri main tabdeel kar diya
 Even speaking something was a crime
 42wein samvidhan sanshodhan ke jariye adaalaton par ankush laga diya gaya
 Also, Parliament and other institutions were not spared

 Congress used Article 356 nearly a hundred times

 If he did not like any state government or leader, then the government itself was dismissed
 adaalaton kii avmaananaa karne main to congress ne maharath hasil kar lee he
 It was Mrs Indira Gandhi who wanted a "committed Judiciary" ie 'committed Judiciary'
 wo chaahati thim ki adaalatein samvidhan kii jagah ek parivaar ke prati vafaadaar rahen
 In this desire for a 'committed judiciary', the Congress ignored many respected judges while appointing the Chief Justice of India
 congress ke kaam karne kaa tarika ekadam saaf he - pehle nakaaro, phir apamaanit karo or iske baad dhamkaao
 If a judicial verdict goes against them, they first deny it, then defame the judge and then proceed to bring impeachment against the judge

 It is clear from his comment that what kind of thinking and treatment does Congress have towards government institutions
 upie shashan ke daur ko yaad kiijie, us samay congress ne CAG par sirf isliye sawaal uthaae the, kyonki usne congress sarkaar ke 2G ghotaalaa, koyala ghotaalaa jaise bhrashtachar ko ujagar kiya tha
 The CBI had become a Congress Bureau of Investigation during the UPA regime - it was repeatedly misused against political parties before the Lok Sabha elections
 ibi or RAW jaise mahatvapurn sansthaanon main jaanboojhkar tanaav paidaa kiya gaya
 The policy decision taken by the Union Cabinet was torn by a person who was not even a member of the cabinet and that too during a press conference
 NAC yani rashtriya salaahkaar parishad ko pradhanmantri karyaalay ke samanaantar khadaa kar diya gaya tha
 And the same Congress today talks about institutions! Not only this, just remember, in the 1990s, the story of a fictional espionage scandal was created in the country's major space agency ISRO for the political benefit of Kerala Congress

 Armed Forces: Congress has always viewed the defense sector as a source of revenue

 Since 1947, there have been various defense scams in every Congress government
 ghotaalon kii inaki shuruyaat jeep se hui thi, jo top, pandubbi or helicopter tak pahunch gai
 Each middleman has been associated with a particular family
 yaad kiijie, congress ke ek bade netaa ne jab sena pramukh ko gunda kaha to uske baad party main uskaa kad badha diya gaya
 This shows the kind of disrespect towards their army
 jab hamaari sena aatankiyon or uske saraparaston ke khilaaf karrwai karti he, to congress ke netaa raajnneetik netritv par ‘khun kii dallali’ kaa aarope lagaate hai
 When the brave men of our Air Force attack the terrorists, the Congress questions their claim
 congress main aantarik loktantr kaa abhaav:raajnneetik dal us jeevant sanstha kii tarah hote hai, jahaan bhinn-bhinn vichaaron kaa sammaan hota he
 But sadly, the Congress has no faith in internal democracy
 agar koi netaa party adhyaksh banane kaa sapana bhi dekhe, to congress main use fouran baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya jaataa he
 Even in a normal legal process, there is a sense of pride and authority in their behavior
 vartmaan main unka sheersh netritv bade-bade ghotaalon main jamaanat par he
 Whenever an authority asks questions related to the scam, they do not even consider it appropriate to answer
 kya ve log apni javabdehi se dare hue hai?jaraa sochie:press se parliament tak
 From Soldiers to Free Speech
 constitution se lekar court tak
 Disrespecting institutions has been the way of Congress
 unki soch yahi he ki sab galat hai, or sirf congress sahi he
 That is, 'no account, what Congress says is correct'
 jab bhi aap vot dene jaaen, ateet ko ek baar jarur yaad karen ki kis prakaar ek parivaar kii satta kii laalasaa ke chalate desh ne baari keemat chukaai
 When they have always placed the country at stake, it is certain that they will still do the same

 From Dawood Call Connection to the revenue crisis of Maharashtra Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse, involved in the MIDC land dispute, the problems are increasing
 visal blor hemanth gavande ne shivaji nagar thane kii diary saamne laakar khulaasa kiya tha ki khadse ne apane prabhaav kaa durupyog karte hue un par cese darj karaayaa tha
 Meanwhile, Khadse has also received a setback from the RSS
 sangh vichaarak rakesh sinha ne unase istife kii maang kii he
 'aaj Tak' spoke directly to Inspector Hiraman Shirsat of Shivaji Nagar police station to investigate Gawande's claim, and Hiraman Negawande's claim was sealed
 'aaj tak' ne inspector ke saamne sidhe sawaal daage or pataa lagaaya ki kya gavande kaa aarope sahi he
 Have you written this station diary to verify? Whoever has given us the station diary extracted by the ITI, the news should not be misconstrued
 police adhikari hiraaman shirsat-sahi he na ye
 It is written that the minister has filed a case on the request of Eknath Khadse, is this correct? Hiraman Shirsat - It is written that it is right
 main kya bol rahaa hum, likhaa he wo sahi he
 There is my signature
 hastakshar he udhar
 In this way it became clear that the diary was written by Inspector Hiraman
 to cese pehle aapke paas hi aayaa tha? aapako bhi pehle khadse sahab ne phone kiya ki cese register karo?hiraaman shirsat-meraa register karne kaa sawaal hi nahin hota
 i told them in front that the register does not happen
 to unako gussa aayaa, bolaa meraa adhikaar he kaise nahin karata, phir krishi ko bolaa daakhil karo
 i wrote it down, there is no case in it
 inspector hiraaman ke mutabik unhone saaf kaha tha ki gavande par maamla nahin banataa
 But Khadse did not listen to him
 unhone krishi vibhaag ke afasaron ko cese darj karne kaa aadesh de diya
 Senior officials did not say anything? Hiraman Shirsat - Why will you say, the police said no offenses, we will not offend
 usne phir unako kaha tum register karo offence
 Then if he comes then why will we leave
 unako kin ko bolaa?hiraaman shirsat-krishi adhikariyon ko bolaa ki tum karo offence register
 Amazing man
 hiraaman shirsat-ye bahut bada lafada he, kya karne kaa
 The party will take the decision
 It is clear from this revelation that Khadse misused his influence and used the post for his selfishness
 mana ja rahaa he ki vidhaan parishad chunaav ke baad party ekanath khadse ko lekar koi faisla karegi
 The party is facing a lot of internal opposition for giving tickets to tainted candidates in MLC elections too
 rakesh sinha ne maanga istifavivaadon main ghire khadse se sangh vichaarak rakesh sinha ne istipha dene ko kaha he
 Sinha said that Eknath Khadse should resign

 At the same time, Manmohan Vaidya of the Sangh said that there is no interference from the Sangh in this matter

 mulaayam singh yadav madhyavadhi chunaav ke paksh main to hai lekin vah sarkaar giraane kaa paap apane sir par nahin lenaa chaahate hai
 After sp's sweeping majority in power in the state elections six months ago, Mulayam has on several occasions asked the party workers to be ready for elections, expressing the possibility of a mid-term general election
 vartmaan halaat main mulaayam ko pataa he ki agar loksabhaa chunaav jaldi yani 2014 se pehle ho jaaenge to kam se kam uttar pradesh main unako utana hi adhik phayda hoga
 The SP, which won a record majority in the recent assembly elections, got its mandate for the first time

 ' party ke rashtriya mahasachiv ram gopal yadav ne sarkaar giraane kii baat se inkaar karte hue kaha, "philhal centre sarkaar ko hamaara samarthan he
 During this time Yadav also said, 'SP is fully ready for the election

 india-china relations have suddenly become extremely important for the 2019 general elections
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa june main china ke raashtrapati shi jinping se milanaa tay he
 Despite this, Prime Minister Modi and President Jinping have decided to meet each other informally this week after an exercise of last one week
 modi-jinping mulakaatchin ke liye yah mauka maujuuda vaishvik chunautiyaan ke bich kuch nayaa pintara chalane kaa he
 At the same time, this is the last chance for the ruling BJP government in India to do something big and different in the field of global business before the general elections due in early 2019
 ise padhein: modi se mulaakaat main china chahega bharat se ye paanch badi saugatmodi sarkaar ke kaarykaal ko chaar saal puure hone ja rahe hai
 The central government has to present its four-year tenure report card in a month
 haalanki usase bhi pehle karnataka main behad ahm vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 The BJP hopes to show the ruling Congress a way out before the general elections
 congress mukt bharat ke baad kya?isse ek vah 'congress mukt bharat' naare ko safal karne ke behad kareeb pahunch jaaegi or do aam chunaavon se pehle uski lokapriyata ek baar phir bina kisi chunauti ke sheersh par sthapit ho jaaegi
 Both things will serve to pave the way for him to win in 2019
 iske baavjood modi sarkaar ke saamne sabase badi chunauti gharelu or vaishvik aarthik kshetra main paidaa ho rahi he
 To meet these challenges, it needs to do something big and something different globally
 ise padhein: china se vyapaar ke ye 3 getwe, aayaat-niryaat main asantulan bharat kii badi chintamodi sarkaar kii aarthik chunautiyaan?gauratlab he ki jahaan gharelu arthvyavastha notebandi, jiesti, bank ghotaale or berogari kii chunautiyon se jujh rahi rahi, vahiin vaishvik str par america or china ke bich gaharaata trade war or kachche tel kii keemton main lagaataar ho rahaa ijapha bhavishya kii chunautiyon ko or bhi gaharaa kar rahe hai
 In the midst of all this, the Modi government does not see any significant initiative from any country for its flagship program like Make in India
 ise padhein: guadar bandargah hi nahin pakistan ke punarnirmaan ke bade mishan par juta he chinachin ek aakhri mauka?modi sarkaar ke sabase ahm kaarykram 'mek in india' ko china se 'sanjivani' mil sakati he
 On the economic front, this is the only means of getting relief before the general elections
 jinping se is hafte or june kii mulaakaat ke baad pradhanmantri modi vaishvik str par na hi kisi bade netaa se milenge or na hi kisi bade desh ko bharat kii aisi sarkaar se qaraar karne main ruchi hogi jo aam chunaavon main kharaab aarthik report card lekar ja rahi he
 In such a situation, during the meeting of modi-jinping in June, Make in India, One Belt One Road, IT, Energy, import-export and Banking can play an important role in building a consensus

 The Hindus were the richest during the Mughal era
 iske baad se actress ko kaaphi trol kiya jane laga
 Many users said that the Mughals were robbers and they killed many Hindus of the country, the same many users also asked whether people like Rani Laxmibai, Mangal Pandey, Tatya Tope were idiots

 Many people were angry with Swara Bhaskar for supporting the Mughals

 petroleum mantri virappa moili ne kaha ki congress kisi kaa bachaav nahin karegi or 1984 main bhadke sikh virdohi dangon main kathith bhoomika ke aaropon kaa saamana kar rahe party ke varisht netaa jagadish titalar ke maamle main kanoon apana kaam karegaa
 "our heart is sad for the victims," moily told reporters
 ham yahaan kisi kaa bachaav karne ke liye nahin hai
 The law will do its job in this matter
 unhone saath hi dhyaan dilaayaa ki congress ne sikh virdohi dangon ke maamle main 1985-86 main hi 'naitik jimmedaari' sweekaar kar lee thi
 The comments moili ne haalanki yah bhi kaha ki titalar ke khilaaf lage aarope utane gambhir nahin hai, jitne gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke khilaaf lage aarope the or unhone gujarat main 2002 main hue dangon ke maamle main khud ko nirdosh sabit karne ke liye ek bhi kadam nahin uthaaya
 Tytler was shocked when a Delhi court gave a clean chit to the Congress leader of the CBI in the 29-year-old case of anti-sikh riots, bypassing the closure report and investigating the murder of three people
 Ordered to do it again
 moili ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, hamaara dil peediton ke liye dukhi he
 We are not here to defend anyone
 kanoon is maamle main apana kaam karegaa
 He also pointed out that the Congress had accepted 'moral responsibility' in the case of anti-sikh riots in 1985-86

 If there is no deal in business, then we accuse you of fraud, if we lose money in the stock market, then luck
 par kya vaaki sachai bhi yahi hoti he?visheshgyon kii maane to har baar bhagya ko dosha dene yaa dusron par aarope lagane se kahin behatar hoga ki ham apni un aadaton ko badalane par dhyaan den jinke chalate ye nuksaan ho rahe hai
 Do you know that some of our habits prevent us from reaching the peak where we want to reach
 1) suniyojit tareeke se kaam karensbase pehle apane niskriy acount band karen
 Mutual funds are a good option, so save money and invest in a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)
 inhen faislon ko lene main log kaaphi lanbaa samay laga dete hai
 In such a situation, a lot of time passes and then after years they think that if they had started investing at that time, they would have been getting good returns today
 2) chizon ko nazarandaaj karnakya aapako pataa he kuch maamalon main hamaara ye ravaiya dusron ke liye bonus kaa kaam karata he
 That is, the things that we ignore, others do the same thing and take advantage
 isiilie kaam bada, lanbaa yaa kathin ho to bhi use karne kii koshish jarur karen
 3) Always afraid, many times people do not want to take any risk and put their saved money in a fixed deposit
 iskaa nateeja ye hota he ki ve apane ritairement plan ko bhi bahut majbootee nahin de pate hai
 Although not investing in shares is not a wrong decision but there are some risks that you can take at a young age
 45 kii umr main bhale hi aapako risk lene se pehle do baar sochna pade lekin 22 saal kii umr main aap ye faisle lekar ek baar parinaam dekh sakate hai
 4) Spend according to your ability Many times we see that people give more value than education funds for children to buy tablet phones
 hamaari inakam or bachat kaa faisla hamaare offis ke saathi, rishtedaar or padosiyon ke fasebuk post par nirbhar karne lagata he
 Who bought what, what sold, where did he go, and what not
 kam shabdon main kahen ko apni chadar dekhakar hi paanv pasaarna chahie
 5) Always want to get things for free, who does not like free stuff
 par baat jab vittiya phaayde kii ho to is tarah kii soch rakhana galat baat he
 a free insurance policy with a credit card or investment plan will not always work
 ek stock brokar aapako aise share kharidne kaa suzav de saktaa he jo usne pehle kam keemat par kharide hon
 But invest only after consulting a better broker or expert
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii byopic film piem narendra modi 24 may ko relies hone ja rahi he
 The release date of the film was changed several times and now it will finally be released in theaters
 vivek oberoi starer is film kaa nirdesan omang kumaar ne kiya he
 There was a lot of controversy about the film, with the opposition alleging that Prime Minister Modi has been glorified in the film and releasing it just before the election would be a violation of the code of conduct
 vipaksh kaa aarope tha ki chunaavon ke dauraan yadi film cinemagharon main chalegi to isse voters kaa dhruvikaran hoga
 After getting the green signal from the censor board and court, the ball was completely in the court of the Election Commission, and the Election Commission banned it just before the release of the film
 chunaav ayog ne film ko 'hagiography' bataate hue isaki relies ko chunaavon kii prakriya puri hone tak roak diya
 After the film was banned for a certain period, it was speculated that if the film was released after the elections, it would not be able to show anything special at the box office
 anumaan tha ki film shaayad hi apni laagat nikaal paae
 However, after exit polls, the outlook seems to be changing
 kaha ye ja rahaa he ki yadi bhaajapa baari bahumat se satta main ai to film bhi hit ho jaaegi
 The film could be a new beginning for Vivek Oberoi
 salmaan khan se hue vivaad ke baad se vivek kaa kariyar kuch khaas nahin chalaa he
 He worked but did not run at the box office
 is film ko unki ek nai shuruyaat mana ja rahaa he
 It has to be seen how the film performs at the box office
 loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey film ke liye bahut kuch tay karenge
 To prevent fraud in banking and tax system, the Central Government has issued a new PAN card (permanent Account Number) with effect from 1 January 2017

 As a new feature, it has the facility of Quick Response Code (QR Code)
 vahiin nae card main aapke pan number or signechar ko nai jagah di gai he
 Why the new PAN card is coming? After the note ban, the government has decided to issue a new PAN card with the intention of making major reforms in the banking and tax structure in the country
 is kadam se sarkaar kii koshish desh main tex base ko badhaane ke saath-saath pan card yugers dwaara kisi farjiwade par lagaam lagane kii hogi
 Around 200 million people in the country have a PAN card

 After this, an attempt has been made to redefine the security standards of PAN cards through this new card

 PAN card is now required On 8 January 2017, the central government made it mandatory for all bank account holders to deposit PAN in their respective banks by 28 February 2017
 isse pehle notebandi ke dauraan rigerv bank ne sabhi bainkon ko hidaayat di thi ki kisi bhi badi rakam ko bina pan card number die adaa na kiya jaae
 Presently PAN card is mandatory for any purchase above Rs 1 lakh
 vahiin kai kshetron main bina pan ke tranjaction sambhav nahin he
 Hence, moving in the direction of cashless economy, it is expected that more and more transactions will be done through PAN which will give the government a larger tax base
 kaise len nayaa pan cardinakam tex niyamon ke mutabik ek vyakti athwa sanstha ko ek hi pan number jari kiya ja saktaa he
 The government has now decided to change all the newly issued PAN numbers through this new feature card

 Your new PAN card will be equipped with these features after getting reprinted

 The charge is Rs 93, which will add a total of Rs 107 by adding a service charge

 agar pakistan ko lagata he ki aatankwaad se vah akelaa nahin lard saktaa, to use aisa karnaa chahie
 Rajnath Singh's statement came at a time when there is a dispute over the rhetoric related to the foundation stone of Kartarpur Corridor
 coridor ko lekar jahaan pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne kaha he ki imran khan kii gugali par bharat ne do mantriyon ko kartarpur bheja
 Responding to them, Sushma Swaraj said that India is not trapped in her googly, but our two ministers went there so that they could pray
 isse pehle pakistan main kartarpur coridor kii jab aadharshila rakhi gai tab vahaan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne kaha tha ki donon mulkon ke bich kashmir hi ek masalaa he or baatcheet ke jariye use hal kiya ja saktaa he
 Imran had also reiterated that if India goes one step in this direction, then it is ready to come two steps ahead

 Metro fares are increasing in Delhi since Tuesday and it is feared that the ridership of the metro will be reduced due to the increase in fares
 lekin ek taaja survey main chakit karne vaala virodhabhas saamne aayaa he
 According to the survey, people do not want to travel even in DTC buses despite the increase in Metro fare
 dilli main skool of architekchar and planning ne yah survey kii he
 According to the report, millions of passengers in DTC buses and metro are getting reduced daily, but people do not want to travel in DTC buses
 'ajtak' kii team ne report main saamne aae sabhi tathyon kii padtaal kii
 However, the School of Architecture and Planning did this survey with regard to Delhi's climat, through which they wanted to find out why pollution is increasing in Delhi
 survey ke mutabik dilli main abhi 51
 6 percent of people use public transport
 lekin ab dilliwasi ditisi ki bason main safar nahin karte, balki taxi yaa cab kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 Sanjay Gupta, president of the Transport Planning Division at the School of Architecture and Planning, said that in Delhi 2015-16, 3
5 million passengers used public transport daily, but now only 31 lakh passengers use public transport every day
 Use vah kehete hai ki agar dilli main saarvajanik parivahan ko dhyaan main rakhkar yojana nahin banaai gai to nijee vaahan badhate jaaenge
 Traffic jam is the biggest problem but why do people in Delhi not want to travel in DTC buses? When it was investigated by the team of 'aaj Tak', it was found that thousands of DTC buses originate daily from Delhi's Anandvihar bus stand
 magar bas adde par itnaa jam hota he ki bason ko nikalne main hi 2 ghante kaa samay lag jaataa he
 There is a long traffic jam daily at the Anandvihar bus stand
 agar kisi yatri ko bas adde se baahar nikalne main hi 2 ghante lag jaaenge to kaise koi in bason main safar karegaa
 But apart from this, what other drawbacks are there in DTC buses? After all, why people are not traveling in buses? The drivers and conductors of DTC themselves told Aaj Tak about this
 ditisi bas ke drywaron or conduktaron kaa kahana he ki basen kam hai
 The problem of jam is more
 asi bason kaa kiraaya zyada he
 That is why people use cabs
 2030 main kya hogi dilli kii sadakon kii sthitireport main kuch aankade to behad chaunkaane vaale hai
 According to the report, if DTC buses are not improved in time, then in 2030 most people in Delhi will travel by private vehicles
 - is samay dilli kii sadakon par sabhi vaahan 1
 16 crore trips, which increased to 3 in 2030
 60 karod trip ho jaaegi- dilli main 2030 main saarvajanik parivahan kul parivahan kaa maatr 45 phisadi rah jayegadillivaasiyon kaa ditisi bason main safar na karne ko lekar kahana he ki ve isliye ditisi bason main nahin yatra karte, kyonki ditisi basen samay par nahin milteen or milti bhi hai to stop par nahin rukatin or trephic jam main fansi rahati hai
 Delhi's first choice is to travel in cabs Most people in Delhi now use cabs
 logon main safar ke liye cab ke istemaal kii badhate chalan par cab istemaal karne waalon kaa kahana he ki ditisi basen samay par nahin aatin, jabaki cab kaa istemaal na sirf aasaan, sahaj or sukundaayak rahata he, balki isse samay bhi bachataa he
 That is, if overall the condition of DTC buses is not improved, then such DTC buses will continue to complete their route without passengers and will go into losses

 He has conveyed his opinion in this regard to the Central Election Commission by writing a letter
 apni chitthee main rajya nirvachan ayog ne puraani iviem ke istemaal ko khaarij kiya he
 The Commission says that the use of evms till 2006 has stopped the Central Election Commission, so it does not justify holding elections
 bataa den ki upi main june-july maheene main nagar nigam chunaav hone hai
 In such a situation, if the Election Commission does not provide new evms soon, then there is a possibility that the municipal elections of UP can be conducted with ballot paper

 The BRICS initiative, however, is still far from abolishing the system centered on the International Monetary Fund, the West-dominated World Bank formed under the Bretton Wood Agreement after the Second World War
 antarrashtriya mudrakosh tathaa vishwabank pichley 70 saal se vaishvik vittiya pranali ke centre main rahe hai
 These institutions have played a big role in helping countries overcome economic problems and help development projects
 vishwabank or antarrashtriya mudrakosh jaise sanghathanon kii aalochana ho rahi he
 It is being said that these organizations are not able to reflect the increasing importance and contribution of newly emerging major developing countries in the global economy
 duniya kii duusari sabase badi arthvyavastha china ke paas mudrakosh ke sanchaalan main italy ke mukaable thodaa hi zyada voting adhikaar hai, jabaki yah europea desh china ke paanchaven hisse ke baraabar he

 In fact, Western countries were skeptical that the five emerging economies would be able to overcome their individual needs and goals

 Significantly, the decision was taken in the meeting of the House of Representatives of Nagaur on 13 March 2016 regarding this change in the RSSK uniform

 During that time, the khaki shirt was changed to white shirt

 Finally, at the meeting of the House of Representatives on March 13, the decision to include khaki half pants in dark brown full pants was taken unanimously

 Instant messaging app whatsapp is under the scanner for fake news and rumor-spreading messages
 fasebuk kii sahaayak company watsap ne ab vigyapanon kaa sahaara lenaa shuru kiya he
 This advertisement from whatsapp is coming at a time when the person lost his life due to forwarding fake whatsapp messages in India
 galat jaankaree se bachane ke liye hindi or angreji akhbaar main phul pej vigyaapan dekar bataaya ja rahaa he ki aap galat jaankaree se kaise batch sakate hai
 In this advertisement 10 points have been given and the company says that if you accept these suggestions, then you will be able to find out whether the content received on whatsapp is true or not
 is vigyaapan main sabase pehle ek nay feechar kaa zikr he jo isihafte shuru hoga
 We also told you about this feature earlier
 darasal is feechar ke tahat forverd kiye gaye massej par ek label hoga jisase yujar ye samaj paaenge ki ye massej forverd kiya gaya he
 Can Fake News stop the suggestion given in the advertisement? There is no suggestion which is new except the first point in this advertisement
 is tarah ke suzav ke bare main pehle se hi jaanate hai
 For example, it is written here that such information is difficult to believe or read any message carefully
 yaa aise massej jo thode alag lagate hai
 Most of the given points are simple and also quite basic
 in points main aisa kuch bhi nahin he jisase ye sunishchit ho sake ki watsap par phek news band ho jaaenge
 The 10 points mentioned by whatsapp will not affect the fake news much
 aise isliye kyonki isamen watsap kii taraf se kuch bhi aise kadam kaa zikr nahin he jisase phek news par lagaam lag sake
 The advertisement only says that you have to do everything to the users
 watsap iske liye kuch nahin karegaa
 To avoid the fake profile of whatsapp, we have to take measures to make it propaganda accounts, such fake accounts are not only on Facebook, but on whatsapp
 ek shaks alag alag number lekar watsap yuj karata he or iske liye mobile companiyaan bhi jimmedaar hanmobile companiyaan kaise hai jimmedaarkai chini companiyaan watsap clon yaa ap clon kaa feechar detii hai
 According to the rules of whatsapp, a phone will have an app in which you will be able to log in with a single account
 lekin mobile companiyon ne iskaa tod nikaal liya he or ek phone main watsap ap clon karke ek se zyada number ke acount yuj karne kaa opshan mil rahaa he
 It also seems to be misused
 watsap kii laachaariwatsap and tu and ancripshan vaala miseging plateform he
 In such a situation, what is a person talking to another, what are the contents of the message, the company does not access such information by citing security and privacy
 isliye yah mumkin nahin he ki har massej ke contant kii padtaal kii jaae, kyonki agar aisa hua to watsap ke liye hi nahin balki yugers ke liye bada sankat aayega
 whatsapp should bring new tools to avoid misleading news, prevent misinformation and prevent fake users, whatsapp will be better if it brings some tools and features
 is vigyaapan main diya gaya pehla point massej forverd label kaa feechar kaa he jo kuch had tak galat jaankaree se bachane main madad kar saktaa he
 According to reports, whatsapp is working on an experiment named Suspicious Link Detection
 philhal isaki beta testing kii ja rahi he or iske tahat phek or farji news website vaale link ko detect karke aapako iske bare main agaah kiya jayega
 The app will tell users from the Red Label Indicator that it is spam
 agar iske baad bhi yujar use open karnaa chahega to watsap kaa last warning milegaa, haalanki iske baad is massej ko open kiya ja sakegaa
 These two features also indicate that the company is more serious than before to deal with fake news and some more such features can be seen in the coming time
 whatsapp ne reword program kii bhi shuruyaat kii haveotsap par teji se fail rahi galat jaankaree ko rokane ke liye watsap shodhakartaaon ko 50 hajaar dollar (lagbhag 34

 iske liye unhen galat jaankaree se nipatane kaa propojal dena hoga agar company ko pasand aayaa to unhen reword mil saktaa he
 Nearly 1,800 years before Madhavi Menonaj, literature, Purana Katha and religious texts and kamshastras not only find comfortable mention of eunuchs and their sexuality as a part of society but also their virtues have been depicted in them
 ram katha main anushruti he ki bhagwaan ram jab vanvaas ke liye ja rahe the to unhone jangal ke kinare pahunchakar 14 varshon tak apane saath rahane ko aatur praja se kaha ki sabhi nar, nari or bachche waapas laut jaaen
 But eunuchs who did not fall into any of these categories stayed for 14 years at the same place where they were and waited for Rama to return
 unki is bhakthi se abhibhoot hokar ram ne unhen aashirwad dene kii vah vishesh shakti pradaan kii jiske liye ve aaj bhi jane jate hai
 The word eunuch in the Mughal courts is derived from the Islamic calendar Hijri, which began in 622 AD when Prophet Mohammad Saheb traveled from Mecca to Medina
 is shabd kaa sambandh julm se dur bhaagane ke arth main hone se hijadon ko aitihaasik rup se nek insaan ke rup main chinhit kar diya gaya he
 That is, those who seek refuge and freedom to escape barbarism and remain in a state of ruthless political pressure
 yahaan is maamle main hijde ve hai jo ling or youniktaa ke atyachaarpurn vyavhaar se bachakar bhaagate hai
 Kamasutra mentions people of 'third nature' in many places, in which their sexuality is described as similar to men and women
 dharmik or dharmanirpeksh paramparaon, hindu or muslim dharm granthon or prachalanon main hijde—bharat main jinhen kinnar, kothi, aravanee ke naam se janaa jaataa he—puure bharat kaa abhinn hissaa rahe hai
 Historically, eunuchs in India have never been described as rogue or unwanted, either widely and systematically or publicly banned
 lekin yah sari sthiti tab badal gai jab angrejon ne 1871 kaa criminal tribs kanoon banaaya
 This law, which was repealed by the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1952, states that eunuchs in other tribes, castes and social groups were born criminals and needed to be outlawed
 kinnaron kaa aparaadh yah tha ki ve purush or stri kii langik shrenee main nahin aate the or unka rahan-sahan unase bhinn tha
 Even though they were considered physically male, they used to dress and dance and sing like women
 unke is tarah ke vyavhaar ko dekhakar angrej darate the isliye unhone is sabko aparaadh bana diya
 In the British Raj, the eunuchs had to forcibly register their names and were arrested if they were seen dancing and singing in public
 criminal tribs kanoon ne langik or yongat saamaanya vyavhaar ke prati kisi bhi virodh ko aapraadhik banane kaa rasta saaf kar diya
 As a result of these changes in India we are now in an unfamiliar position in terms of sexual non-normal behavior
 hamaari smriti main aitihaasik rup se hijadon kaa mahatv barkaraar he, phir bhi unke apradhi hone kii dharna bani hui he
 The British deprived citizenship of those people whose living and behavior was not in accordance with their understanding, as a threat to the system
 kya ham usee model par chalanaa chaahate hai
 Or we embrace difference and live everyday life as Nehru wanted
 kya ham vibhinn youniktaaon ko kisi bhedbhaav ke bina sweekaar karnaa chaahate hai
 Or are we satisfied that other people are treated as criminals simply because their behavior is different
 iskaa ek 'bhartiya' vikalp yah hoga ki us aupniveshik viraasat ko alag kiya jaae jisamen kisi youniktaa ko aparaadh banaaya gaya tha
 The Supreme Court did the same with its decision on Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code and changed a British law which was made against the non-normal behavior prevalent in India
 doosraa yah ki ham samaan ling waalon ke liye sarogesi par bhedbhaav jaise muddon par udasin ravaiya rakhen
 Do we accept the tradition of eunuchs or should we leave them in the fold of the Transgender Persons (protection of Rights) Bill
 is bill main maang kii gai he ki hijadon ko transgender ghoshit kiye jane se pehle unki chikitsa jaanch honi chahie
 If we give importance to hypocrisy instead of generality then we should know that this situation has been in India only for 248 years
 isaki shuruyaat british samrajya ke samay se hoti he
 But for almost 2,000 years, many sexual practices have been prevalent and thriving in our society and we have been accepting them, but we call them homosexuality and trans sexuality

 The Accidental Prime Minister: 'the Accidental Prime Minister' has been released today
 sanjay baru kii kitaab par aadhaarit film 'da accidental prime ministar' main purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh (manmohan Singh) ke kaarykaal ko dikhaaya gaya he or manmohan singh ke kirdaar ko anupam kher ne nibhaayaa he
 Sanjay Baru is played by Bollywood actor Akshaye Khanna
 'da accidental prime ministar (the Accidental Prime Minister)'ko dekhne ke baad sabase pehali baat jo jehan main aati he, vah yahi he ki sanjay baru kaa dard sirf yah nahin he ki manmohan singh sonia gandhi kii sunate hai
 Throughout the film, it has emerged that Manmohan Singh does not listen to his media advisor Sanjay Baru
 'da accidental prime ministar (the Accidental Prime Minister)' main pehle seen se hi aisa lagata he ki sanjay baru piemo main apni badshahath kaayam karnaa chaahate the
 Looking at Sanjay Baru shown in the film, it seems that everyone in the PMO was suspicious and was planning a conspiracy against Manmohan Singh
 manmohan singh ko ekadam aisa dikhaaya gaya he ki jaise ve congress kii nahin balki vipakshi party kii sarkaar chalaa rahe hon
 It seems like the way Sanjay Baru talks
 'da accidental prime ministar (the Accidental Prime Minister)' main har jagah piem manmohan singh ko sanjay baru salaah dete najar aate hai
 When Manmohan Singh does not listen to them, he is jittery
 aakhir main to sanjay baru manmohan singh ko kamjor hi kah daalate hai
 From the very first scene it seems that Sanjay Baru does not like Sonia Gandhi at all, but Manmohan Singh has been made Sonia Gandhi by the PM, he does not want to forget the former PM
 yahi nahin, manmohan singh kii vinamrata kaa bhi majaak banaaya gaya he or unhen nadaan siddh karne kii koshish kii gai he
 One thing also emerges that the right decisions are of Manmohan and Sanjay, the wrong decisions by Sonia
 a post shared by Anupam Kher (@anupampkher) on Jan 2, 2019 at 10:06pm pst'da accidental prime ministar (the Accidental Prime Minister)' main aisa lagata he ki ahamed patel se lekar jairam ramesh tak sabhi manmohan singh ke khilaaf sajeesh main jute hai
 Ahmed Patel is shown in a scene like a villain of Bollywood
 kul milakar film main manmohan singh (manmohan Singh) ko behad kamjor dikhaane kii koshish kii gai he aisa katai nahin he
 Sonia Gandhi says that if you work, the rest of the party will see
 lekin sanjay baru kehete hai ki kaam chhodkar aap baaki sabakuch karen main dekh luungaa
 The same pain of Sanjay Baru is seen in the film
 film ke aakhir main to manmohan singh sanjay baru se munh hi pher lete hai or phir nahin milte hai

 darasal, suraksha agenciyon ne maovadiyon ke kuch sheersh netaaon ke bich hone vaali baatcheet suni he, jo chhattisgarh, jharkhand or odisha ke ghaney jangalon main chhipe hue hai

 uttar pradesh kii 10 siton par rajyasabha chunaav main 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke liye siyaasi bisaat bichaai ja rahi thi
 The SP-BSP alliance was founded on the 10th seat of the state
 sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav ne basapa ummidavaar bhimrao ambedkar ko jitaane kii harsambhav koshish kii, lekin bijepi ke sameekaran or bispi vidhayak kii cross voting ne mansoobon par pani pher diya he
 In such a situation, a big question has emerged as to whether any SP-BSP alliance will be formed for the Lok Sabha elections in future? According to the information from sources, at present, the BSP is not angry about the role of SP after the results of Rajya Sabha elections
 nateezon ke aane ke baad basapa ke mahasachiv satish chandra mishra ne kaha, basapa, sapa or congress gathbandhan ke paryaapt mat basapa ummidavaar bhimrao ambedkar ko mil hai
 BJP has won the Rajya Sabha elections on the strength of money power and dishonesty
 unhone kaha, bijepi ne bhimrao ambedkar ko rajyasabha main jane se rokkar dalit virdohi hone kaa pramaan pesh kiya he
 For this, BJP has fiercely procured mlas
 hamaare do vidhayakon ko matadhikaar karne se vanchit kiya gaya he
 Based on the statement of the BSP leader, it is believed that there is no disagreement among the BSP regarding the cooperation of the SP
 ise bhi padhein : rajyasabha main ab BJP sabase badi party, kya is vajah se hui BSP ke ambedkar kii haar?bataate chalem ki matdaan se pehle soobe ke siyaasi maahaul ke maddenjar basapa supremeo mayawati ne sapa se 10 atarikt vidhayakon kii list maangi thi jo bispi ummidavaar ko pehali praathamikta ke aadhaar par vot karenge
 SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, who had tasted victory in the two Lok Sabha bypolls with the support of the BSP, did not want to break Mayawati's friendship under any circumstances
 isi maddenjar akhilesh yadav ne apane sabase vishwasaneey vidhayakon kii list basapa supremeo ko pehle hi saunp di thi
 On this, SP spokesman Ataurrahman said that Akhilesh Yadav fulfilled the promise made by BSP chief Mayawati with all sincerity
 bhimrao ambedkar ko jitaane main har sambhav madad kii
 But the ruling BJP won by resorting to money power
 basapa-sapa kii dostimein kisi tarah kii koi daraar nahin padani chahie
 In 2019, the SP-BSP together will wipe out the BJP from the state
 donon party ke aam kaaryakartaaon kii chahat he ki ye dosti barkaraar rahe
 ALSO READ: bsp's defeat in Rajya Sabha elections despite sp's support, is the game behind the scenes? It is worth mentioning that in the current political atmosphere, SP-BSP is well aware that they cannot compete with BJP alone Huh
 2014 ke loksabhaa or 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main donon partiyon ne apana hashr dekh liya he
 In such a situation, looking at the political future, they have forgotten the 23-year-old rivalry and extended the hand of friendship
 is koshish se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki donon partiyaan 1995 ke vaakye se baahar nikal chuke hai
 SP-BSP has also got victory formula in Gorakhpur and Phulpur by-elections
 1993 main ramamandir andolan kii lahar ko sapa-basapa ne milakar roka tha
 Then the two parties formed a common government
 ek baar phir donon modi lahar ko rokane ke liye ek jute hone kii koshish main hai
 The defeat of the BSP candidate in the Rajya Sabha election does not seem to have much effect on the friendship of the two parties
 basapa netaa saiysad kasim ne kaha, bijepi ne rajyasabha ke 9wein ummidavaar ko jitaane ke liye jis tarah ke hatkande apanaae hai
 Who will see that BJP has won
 basapa ummidavaar ko bijepi ke pratyaashee se zyada vot mili hai
 But BJP won on the basis of second preference
 aise main naitik jeet basapa kii hui he
 Also read: Away from majority on BJP number-1 in Rajya Sabha, now such situation will happen? According to sources, there is no talk of alliance between the two parties for 2019
 aise main rajyasabha chunaav ke nateezon ke lihaaj se abhi se sapa-basapa gathbandhan kii baat karnaa uchit nahin he
 It will be decided on time, but one thing is clear that if both parties fight elections together, BJP will face difficulties in UP
 2019 main modi ke abhiyaan ko bhi tagada jhatka lag saktaa he
 Needless to say that both SP and BSP are parties in the state which have a strong vote bank
 aise main donon dal milakar chunaav ladenge to bijepi ke liye soobe main 2014 jaise nattejey doharaana bahut mushkil ho jayega
 This is the reason why BJP leaders are taunting the SP-BSP friendship
 rajyasabha chunaav nateezon ke baadamukhyamantri yogi adityanathane kaha tha, sapa sirf lenaa jaanati he, dena nahin
 This statement of CM Yogi can play an important role to create a rift in the friendship between the SP-BSP
 gauratlab he ki upachunaav nateezon ke baad ajam khan ne kaha tha ki 'agar ham phir bichad jaaenge to phir haar jaaenge
 This alliance will last long
 ek dushman ne hamen dost bana diya he
 In 2019, the SP-BSP alliance will go to the polls

 co / iotxwbsiih bhartiya janata party (BJP) ne maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke liye rashtriya mahasachiv bhupendra yadav ko kaman saunpi he
 Bhupendra Yadav has not only been lucky for BJP in many state elections, but has also proved his organizational strength
 amit shah ke saath vah bijepi kii sanghathanaatmak ranneetiyaan tay karne ke liye jane jate hai
 Specializes in laying such an electoral board through which the strategy of anti-bjp parties is successful in demolishing
 chaahe 2013 main rajasthan kaa vidhansabha chunaav ho yaa phir 2014 main jharkhand or 2017 main hue gujarat tathaa uttar pradesh ke chunaav
 In these states, he played the role of Chanakya behind the scenes for the BJP
 jisase bijepi ko jeet mili
 Even though Bhupendra Yadav was not in charge in Uttar Pradesh, BJP president Amit Shah handed him the command of the war room
 vah media management bhi dekh rahe the
 Bihar was the only state where the BJP lost the 2015 assembly elections
 haalanki loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi-jadyu gathbandhan ne lagbhag clin sweep kiya
 Bhupendra Yadav is considered to be Amit Shah's 'mr
 Trustworthy'
 haal main rajyasabha main kai ahm bilon ko paas karaane ke liye virdohi dalon ke saansadon kaa bhi samarthan hasil karne ke liye amit shah ne jo team banaai thi, usamen bhupendra yadav kii bhi ahm bhoomika thi
 a large number of people from Maharashtra live in UP and Karnataka
 mana jaataa he ki isi ko dhyaan main rakhte hue bijepi ne upi se keshav prasad maury or karnataka ke purv vidhayak lakshmana saudi ko bhi sah prabharee banaakar maharashtra bheja he
 Keshav has worked with Bhupendra in the UP elections
 bhupendra yadav ke ek kareebi ne Aajtak
 in told that Bhupendra Yadav is not new to Maharashtra
 vah pichley vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan bhi vahaan kaam kar chuke hai
 Then he was given the Marathwada region
 iske alaava vah maharashtra kii seemaa se jude karnataka ke dharwar aadi kshetron main bhi chunaav ke dauraan kaam kar chuke hai
 It is his organizational ability that modi-shah made him in-charge of his home state of Gujarat in 2017
 yahaan bijepi satta banaae rakhane main safal hui thi
 It is seen that the incharge is more active during the elections, but Bhupendra Yadav makes a program of the camp in the concerned state as soon as the appointment order is issued
 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan nitish kumaar se siton kaa bantwaaraa sulajhane main bhupendra yadav kaa rahaa tha ahm yogadan
 a BJP leader says that the BJP is not as challenged by the Opposition in Maharashtra as it is with its alliance partner Shiv Sena
 aise main chunaav se pehle siton ke pench ko suljhaana bhupendra yadav ke liye chunauti he
 However, the way he settled the seat-sharing among NDA allies in Bihar during the recent Lok Sabha elections, it is believed that there will be no problem in Maharashtra
 maharashtra main oktober main chunaav hone kii sambhaavna he
 Elections can also be held simultaneously in Jharkhand and Haryana
 bhupendra yadav kii prishthibhumi kii baat karen to vah rajasthan ke ajmer ke rahane vaale hai
 50-year-old Bhupendra Yadav, a law student from Government College Ajmer, is also a Supreme Court lawyer
 bhoopendra yadav government college ajmer ke chaatrasangh adhyaksh or 1992 main gurugram main bhajayumo ke adhyaksh bhi rah chuke hai
 The party was sent to the Rajya Sabha for the first time in 2012 by Bhupendra Yadav, who became bjp's national secretary in 2010 after playing the role of general secretary in the Akhil Bharatiya Advocates Council (ABAP) till 2009
 phir 2013 main rajasthan prabharee kii badi jimmedaari saunpi thi
 Bhupendra Yadav succeeded in influencing the party's top leadership by bringing BJP to power
 iske baad, jab 2014 main amit shah adhyaksh bane to unhone bhupendra yadav par or adhik bharosa jataate hue jimmedaariyaan badhaani shuru kin
 He was promoted to national general secretary
 vahiin, varsh 2018 main bijepi ne rajasthan cote se dobaaraa bhupendra yadav ko rajyasabha bheja

 Dhoni is the 12th cricketer to join the club of 10,000 runs

 He is the fourth Indian and the 12th cricketer in the world to reach this stage fastest
 bharat kii taraf se unase pehle sachin tendulkar (18426 ran), saurav ganguli (11363) or rahul dravid (10889) ne das hajaar se adhik ran banaae hai
 37 years old Dhoni played 273 innings to complete 10 thousand runs
 riki ponting ne is mukaam tak pahunchane ke liye 266, jacks kallis ne 272, sachin tendulkar ne 259 or saurav ganguli ne 263 paariyaan kheli thi
 Dhoni comes to bat at number 6
 dhoni ke alaava is mukaam par pahunchane vaale baaki sabhi ballebaaj yaa to openar hai yaa to number 3 yaa number 4 par ballebaaji karne aate the
 In such a situation, batting at number 6 and 7 for any batsman and scoring 10,000 runs is a big record in itself
 number 7 par ballebaaji karte hue sabase zyada shatakiske alaava dhoni ne number saat par ballebaaji karte hue sabase zyada shatak bhi jade hai

 # lambatikegia post shared by Sunny Leone (@sunnyleone) on Jun 20, 2018 at 6:46am PDT The Governor has approved the decision to give 5 percent reservation to Rajasthan Gurjars
 saath hi garib savarnon ko bhi 14 fisadi aarakshan kaa jhunjhuna thamaya gaya he
 Rajasthan is the first state where reservation will be applicable on economic grounds
 isi ke saath gurjaron ne apana andolan khatm karne kaa elaan bhi kar diya
 Significantly, this decision has come after the cost of the death of more than a hundred people and the loss of property worth about one thousand crores
 gurjaron ko 5 fisadi aarakshan mila, to agadi jatiyon ko bhi aarthik aadhaar par 14 fisadi aarakshan kaa rasta saafe ho gaya he
 The Gehlot government of Rajasthan appealed to the Gurjars as well as to avoid the resentment of the upper castes
 haalanki ye vahi formula he jo vasundhara sarkaar ne diya tha
 But Gehlot says that it was his dream to give reservation on economic grounds
 rajasthan main ab aarakshan kaa kota 68 fisadi ho chukaa he
 But the big question is when this was to happen, why was this decision taken after seven years long violent agitation

 Along with this, the court ordered Yeddyurappa not to leave the country without prior permission and not tamper with the evidence
 lokayukta adaalat ne pichley maheene jad es netaa wiesavi datta dwaara daayar nijee shikaayat par yediurppa ko saman jari kiya tha
 The complaint alleged that Yeddyurappa, during his tenure as Chief Minister, had alleged irregularities and bribes in awarding the contract for an irrigation project to the RNS Jyoti Infrastructure Company in Upper Bhadra region
 datta ne aarope lagaaya tha ki is company ko pariyojna kaa theka 1033 karod rupee kii boli par hi de diya gaya jabaki niyamon main saaf he ki theka sabase kam boli lagane vaale ko dena he
 He alleged that in return, the company gave Rs 13 crore to Yeddyurappa's sons and son-in-law Dhavalagiri Developers & Sahyadri Healthcare
 isse pehle yediurppa ke vakil ravi bi nayak ne kaha ki company ko theka dene main koi aniyamitataayen nahin huin
 He also presented copies of all documents related to the case

 Yusuf Pathan, a key member of the Rajasthan Royals of the Indian Premier League (IPL), said he hoped to be the champion of the Shane Warne-led team again, apart from his own aggressive performance in IPL 3
 do saal pehle ipel ke shuruaati charan se rashtriya team main jagah banane vaale yusuf is satr ko lekar bhi khaase utsahit hai or isaki ek vajah gharelu toornamenton main shandaar farm bhi he
 He has shown strong performances in the final matches of Deodhar Trophy and Duleep Trophy
 yusuf ne kaha, ‘ipel ke pehle satr ke baad maine kaaphi cricket kheli he or mere khilne ke str main kaaphi sudhaar hua he or tisare charan main mujhe isse kaaphi madad milegi
 The IPL 3 is expected to perform well
 maine ipel ke pehle charan main shandaar pradarshan ke boote rashtriya team main jagah hasil kii thi or ab bhi mujhe vaise hi dhamaakedaar pradarshan kii aas he
 On March 9, he scored a 39-ball 80 in the final match of the Deodhar Trophy
 isse pehle dalip trophy final main bhi unhone 190 gend main naabad 200 ran banaakar jisase unki team ne pratham shrenee cricket main lakshya hasil karne kaa nayaa ricard banaaya tha
 He was included in the squad for the one-day series against South Africa, but he was not successful in this
 is babat yusuf ne kaha, ‘main team kii jarurat ke hisaab se aakraamak shaat khilne kii koshish karata hum, kai baar yah kargar hota he to kai baar nahin
 'yusuf is still not confirmed in the national team, his performance has been fluctuating behind it
 is baat kaa unhen ahsaas bhi he
 He was also included in the ODI series against South Africa, but his performance was not so great
 yusuf ne 2008 main rajasthan rails kii ore se 179 ke strike rate se chaar ardhashatak se 435 ran banaaye, jisase unhen bangladesh main trikoniya shrinkhalaa or pakistan main asia cap kii team main shaamil kiya gaya
 He hit the fastest 21-ball fifty in the first season of IPL against Deccan Chargers and played a key role in helping his team win the title in the final
 yusuf antim kshanon main tabadatod shaat lagaate hai, jisaki team ko twanti-20 praaroop main kaaphi jarurat hoti he, isse vah kuch chuninda antarrashtriya ballebaajon kii shrenee main shaamil he, jo krij par kam samay bitaane ke baad gaganchumbi chakke jadte hai
 But he has not been able to convert aggressive innings into big innings
 haalanki ipel main khud kii safalataa ke liye vah captain shen warn ko bhi kaaphi shrey dete hai
 The 27-year-old said, "shane Warne used to tell me to do well and because of that he gave me the confidence to do well and was able to perform well in the initial phase of IPL
 jab bhi kahin meri gendbaaji main thodi galati hoti to vah mujhe bataate the jisase mujhe kaaphi madad mili
 'but now his goal in IPL 3 is to get a place in the national team with the best performance
 yusuf kaha, ‘main acchhee farm main hum or ummid karata hum ki ipel teen kaa pradarshan mujhe rashtriya team main jagah pakki karne main madad karegaa
 "although Rajasthan Royals are not considered as strong contenders in IPL 3, Yusuf is confident that his team can win the title
 This all rounder from Vadodara said," We are not being counted as strong contenders but under the captaincy of Warne The team can perform again and we can also become champions
 ’unhone apane aakraamak pradarshan ke bare main kaha, ‘main saatven number par ballebaaji karata hum or paanch se 10 over khilne ko milte hai
 i want to play above, so that i can bat for a long time, but i am part of the team
 main number saat par bhi bade shaat lagaataa hum
 Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not
