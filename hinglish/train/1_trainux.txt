 Punjab government completely failed, now Congress mlas also stamped: Opposition Minister Gurpreet Kangar said - Only CM can do the work of ministers, Congress mlas have demanded to review the performance of ministers of their own government
 saath hi kaha ki agar congress ke mantri apane kaam main khare nahin utren, to nae vidhayakon ko mantri banane kaa mauka diya jaae
 Punjab's Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh's political advisor and MLA Amarinder Singh Raja Wadding spoke about the performance review of the ministers at a time when the discussion on cabinet expansion is in full swing in Punjab
 unke is bayaan ke baad se nayaa vivaad khadaa ho gaya he
 Congress MLA Amarinder Singh Raja Wading said that ministers in the government who are not doing their job properly and whose performance is not right, should be shown the way out of the cabinet
 jab siem ke raajnneetik salaahkaar amarinder singh raja vading ne mantriyon kii parformens rivyuu karne or thik se kaam naa karne vaale mantriyon ko hataane kii maang uthaai, to samarthan main congress ke kuch or vidhayak bhi khulkar saamne aa gaye
 Congress mlas Pargat Singh and Kuldeep Vaidya also shouted yes to Amarinder Singh Raja Vading and said that by reviewing the performance of ministers who have not performed properly in the last 3 years and have not been able to do their ministry properly
 He should be removed from the post and given a chance to new mlas
 mantriyon kii parformens par sawaal khadaa karne vaale congress vidhayakon ko punjab sarkaar ke cabinet mantri gurprit kanghad ne yaad dilaayaa ki punjab cabinet or punjab sarkaar main agar koi sabase bada he, to wo hai punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh, joki party ke tamaam vidhayakon or mantriyon ke liye pita samaan hai
 If there is any resentment or differences of any kind, then these angry mlas should go before Captain Amarinder Singh and not make public statements like this in the media
 punjab sarkaar ke mantri gurprit kanghad ne kaha ki mantriyon kii parformens ko rivyuu karne kaa adhikaar sirf mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ke paas he or wo har mantri va uske mantralay ke kaamkaaj par najar rakhte hai
 Kangar also said that in such a way mlas should not question the work of ministers
 punjab kii captain sarkaar ko vipaksh ne gheraajab congress ke apane vidhayakon or khud siem captain amarinder singh ke raajnneetik salaahkaar ne hi mantriyon kii parformens par sawaal khadey kar die, to vipakshi partiyon ko bhi amarinder sarkaar par hamalaa bolne kaa mauka mil gaya
 Akali Dal spokesperson Charanjeet Brar said that Congress mlas have brought their government to the dock by questioning the performance of their ministers
 par ye baat to pehle se hi punjab kii janata or vipakshi partiyaan kah rahi hai ki punjab sarkaar thik se kaam nahin kar rahi he or puri tarah se fail rahi he
 Now his legislators themselves have confirmed this by questioning the demands of ministers and the performance of ministers

 iske saath hiharpal chimane kaha ki pichley 3 saal main mantri pad par rahete hue mantriyon ne sarkari sansadhano kii jamkar lut-khasot kii he
 In such a situation, mlas who are not able to become ministers, feel that now only two years are left for the elections to come and in such remaining time they should also get a ministerial position, so that they can also get the same amount of government treasury and resources To plunder
 punjab congress ke kai vidhayak pehle se hi apni sarkaar aurcaptain amarinder sinhase behad naaraaz chal rahe hai
 They believe that they are not being heard in their own government and now this resentment is gradually increasing
 punjab main sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke ab 2 saal hi bache hai, aise main naaraaz chal rahe vidhayakon kii koshish he ki mantriyon kii parformes par sawaal khadey karke mantrimandal main entry karne kii he
 Due to this, angry mlas are busy giving such statements openly in front of the media

 On November 19, the birth anniversary of Veerangana Rani Lakshmibai, who fought fiercely against the British in the first freedom struggle of 1857, is celebrated
 unka janm 19 november, 1835 ko hua tha
 The spark of the rebellion in 1857 was lit, and later, the complete light that showed India independence was established
 lakshmibai kii jayanti ke maukey par unhen kaviyitri subhadra kumari chouhan kii kaaljayi kavita ke jariye yaad karnaa zyada uchit rahegaa
 
 
 Among the 10 brave wives of the world, Laxmibai Bhishashaan dynasties had raised Bhrkuti, came to old India again, was young again, everyone had recognized the value of lost freedom, everyone was determined to do away with Firangi
 chamak uthi san sattaavan main, vah talwaar puraani thi,bundele harbolon ke munh hamane suni kahani thi,khub ladi mardaani, vah to jhaansi vaali rani thi
 
 kanpur ke naanaa kii, munhaboli bahan chhabili thi,lakshmibai naam, pita kii vah santan akeli thi,naanaa ke sang padhati thi vah, naanaa ke sang kheli thi,barchhi, dhaal, kripaan, kataari uski yahi saheli thi
 She remembered the stories of Veer Shivaji, we heard the story from the mouth of Bundela Harbolon, she was a queen of Jhansi who fought a lot
 
 Was it Lakshmi or Durga that she herself was the embodiment of valor, seeing the Marathas pulkit, the blows of her swords, the creation and play of fake battle-arches, hunting, encircling and breaking fortifications, these were her favorite messes
 maharashtra-kul-devi uski bhi aradhy bhavani thi,bundele harbolon ke munh hamane suni kahani thi,khub ladi mardaani vah to jhansi vaali rani thi

 Chitra found Arjun, Shiva was a goddess, we heard the story from the mouth of Bundela Harbolon, she was a very strong man, she was the queen of Jhansi
 
 Good luck emerged, there was light in Mudit palaces, but Kalgati secretly surrounded Kali Ghata, when she got bangles in the arrow, brother widowed, queen! Even Fate did not spare
 nisantan mare rajaji rani shok-samaani thi,bundele harbolon ke munh hamane suni kahani thi,khub ladi mardaani vah to jhansi vaali rani thi
 
 buja deep jhaansi kaa tab dalhauzi man main harshaaya,rajya hadap karne kaa usne yah acha avasar paaya,foran fujen bhej durg par apana jhanda fahraaya,laavaaris kaa vaaris banakar british rajya jhaansi aayaa
 The tearful queen saw Jhansi was a Birani, we heard the story from the mouth of the Bundela Harbolon, she fought a lot, she was the queen of Jhansi
 
 Anunay does not listen to the pleas, the maya of the formidable rulers, wanted to be merciful, when he came to India, Dalhousie spread his legs, now he turned back, and he even rejected the feet of the kings
 rani daasi bani, bani yah daasi ab mahraani thi,bundele harbolon ke munh hamane suni kahani thi,khub ladi mardaani vah to jhaansi vaali rani thi

 Bengali, Madras etc

 After being badly defeated in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Bahujan Samaj Party wants to leave no stone unturned in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections and hence the party has started selecting its candidates for these elections to be held in 2017
 party pramukh mayawati ne soobe ke vibhinn janapadon kii vidhansabha siton par party kii jamini takat kaa akalan karne ke baad sambhavit daavedaaron ko chunaav kii taiyaari main jutane kii hari jhandi de di he
 Party sources say that by the end of December this year, the BSP will decide its candidates in most of the seats in the state and from the new year these potential contenders will be seen preparing their electoral ground among the general public
 chunaav chaahe loksabhaa kaa ho yaa vidhansabha kaa, bispi hameshaa kaaphi pehle se ummidavaar tay karti ai he
 BSP chief Mayawati had nominated candidates for the Lok Sabha elections soon after she was out of state power in the 2012 assembly elections
 sambhavit daavedaaron kii taiyaari kii samay-samay par samiksha karne ke saath haalanki kai naam badale bhi gaye
 It is a matter of fact that even after doing all this the BSP did not get success in the last Lok Sabha election
 mayawati ab rajya main party kii majboot paith phir se banane kii koshishon main jute gai hai
 He first decided to make a big change in the organizational structure and changed several coordinators
 party pramukh ke agenda ke hisaab se sanghathan ke naye dhaanche kaa khaakaa pichley dinon mivati ke samaksh rakhaa gaya tha, jo unki kasuti par khara nahin utraa or bispi pramukh ne naye sire se sanghathan ko taiyaar karne kaa kaam party ke jimmedaar netaaon ko saunpa tha
 Sources say that during her stay in the capital, Mayawati has decided the possible candidates for the assembly elections in about 200 seats according to the party's current position and equations there in more than 50 districts of the state, who will be made the assembly in-charge
 tay kiye gaye daavedaaron ko chunaav kii taiyaari kaa lakshya basapa pramukh disambar ke ant tak tay kar dengi or phir prayek chaar maah main inaki taiyaariyon kii gahan samiksha hogi
 BSP sources say that the work of reviewing the preparations will continue till the assembly elections

 Sources say that in most of the seats of western Uttar Pradesh and Purvanchal, the BSP chief has also decided the names of the candidates, but no official information has been released yet
 2019 loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle vipakshi dal ek taraf centre kii modi sarkaar ko haraane ke liye mahagathbandhan kaa khankaa khinch rahe hai
 At the same time, the demand for holding these elections with ballot paper instead of EVM is also gaining momentum
 isi silsile main 17 vipakshi dalon kaa ek pratinidhimandal chunaav ayog se milegaa
 Interestingly, these parties also include Shiv Sena, a BJP ally in the central and Maharashtra governments
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar agle hafte 17 vipakshi dalon kii baithak honi tay he
 In which instead of holding elections from evms, the demand for ballot paper will be discussed
 jiske baad in 17 dalon kaa pratinidhimandal chunaav ayog se milakar apana gyaapan saunpega
 It is worth noting that earlier the Congress and Samajwadi Party had passed resolutions demanding to return to ballot paper in their session

 Why does the opposition not want to contest from evms? In the recently concluded elections, several incidents of disturbances regarding evms were revealed
 jise lekar vipakshi dalon kaa aarope rahaa he ki bijepi iviem main gadabadi kar chunaav main jeet hasil karti he
 So it is an insult to the mandate of the public
 iviem kaa virodh karne vaale dalon kaa yah tark rahaa he ki europe ke viksit deshon, jaise britain, germany or france main agar ballat paper se chunaav ho sakate hai to phir bharat main kyon nahin?chunaav ayog ne di thi khuli chunautiiviem main gadabadi kii ashanka ko dur karne ke liye pichley varsh chunaav ayog ne khuli chunauti di thi ki kisi bhi raajnneetik dal kaa koi bhi visheshgy, vaigyanik or technitian ek hafte yaa 10 din ke liye aakar mashiinon ko hack karne kii koshish kar sakate hai
 After the Commission challenged, only two political parties joined till the last time

 To which the Commission said that this proves the acceptable acceptance of evms

 You must have seen in your cities, no festival has come that pictures of leaders are hung from electricity to traffic lights poles
 har dal ke log yahi karte hai
 Without any meaning, in a single poster, you are greeting four festivals and staring at you with thirty-forty faces
 inaki vajah se kinati durghatnaayen hote hote bachati hongi yaa phir aas paas kaa nazaaraa bhadda lagane lagata hoga, yah aap samaj sakate hai
 Sometimes they also become fatal
 hamaare sahyogi sam dainiel ne bataaya he ki coimbatore ke avinashi sadak ke beeche bich torana dwaar ban rahaa tha, iske upar jo mazdoor chadhe hai ve bhi helmet nahin pahane hai
 If they fall, you can understand what will happen to them
 is torana dwaar ke liye sadak main gadde khod daale gaye
 You will see these scenes everywhere from Ghaziabad to Pune
 ham samajhate hai ki raajnneetik dal desh ke maalik hai, jahaan chahen, vahaan apane netaa kaa photo laga sakate hai
 Our condition has become that one day they will go to homes with hoardings and we will not be able to say anything
 baharhaal, 30 saal ke raghu kii bike is torana dwaar se yaa torana dwaar ke liye bane gadde main padakar ladkadaa gai, raghu gir gaya or ek trek ke neeche aa gaya, mar gaya
 This young man from America came to meet his future bride
 do-do parivaar tabah ho gaye, is hording ke kaaran
 The hoardings belonged to the ruling AIDMK, which was being built for mgr's centenary celebrations
 trek dryver to giraftaar ho gaya lekin hording lagane vaale kii giraftaar nahin hui he
 Police say Raghupati did not wear a helmet
 par kya vahaan hording niyamon ke anusaar laga tha
 Whether hoardings in any city are as per rules
 soshal media par log is ghatana ko lekar apana rosh zaahir kar rahe hai
 Who killed Raghu, the hashtag is going on
 neshnal haive ke bich-bich vishaal toranadwar ban rahaa tha
 People have written with paint, who killed Raghu
 'da kowai post' ne is ghatana ko vistaar se cover kiya he
 a DMK leader filed a petition in the High Court for the removal of all hoardings and also demanded compensation for the family
 shanivaar ko coimbatur ke kamishnar ne un saare hording ko jinke liye anumati nahin lee gai tha hataane ke liye aadesh diya
 The comments chennai main 30 aktubar ko aisi hi ek ghatana main esayuvi car par actor vijay kaa katout gir gaya
 The cutout was 28 feet high
 is durghatana main 38 saal kaa noujvaan gambhir rup se ghayal ho gaya
 There is a lot of anger in Coimbatore about Raghupati's death
 hindu akhbaar kii khabar he ki isi saal 25 aktubar ko hi madras hoicourt ne aadesh diya tha ki puure rajya main katout
 Hoarding will not cause flakes
 hoicourt ne rajya ke mukhya sachiv se kaha tha ki is aadesh ko lagu karaaen
 But 'the Kovai Post' has told how many hoardings have been made illegally in Coimbatore itself
 16 may 2002 kaa ek sadak parivahan or haive ne circular jari kiya tha, jiske saaf saaf kaha gaya tha ki haive par kisi bhi prakaar ke vigyaapan ke hording kii anumati nahin he, sivaay janhit se sambandhit soochnaaon ke
 Look in any city, wherever you like, it puts up hoardings
 kai baar to redlite hi nazar nahin aati
 The young leader hangs his poster on him
 us poster main das bees or netaaon ke photo hote hai
 Many times it hangs in such a way that a slight thunderstorm moves, these hoardings start falling
 pichley saal noida ke dlef mal ke paas aisi hi ghatana hui thi
 The thunderstorm came and fell hoarding 20 feet long and 12 feet wide
 uske neeche se guzar rahe bike savaar pushpendra ko chot ai or unke peeche baithe munna kumaar kii maut ho gai
 On 6 May 2016, a large hoarding fell near Hindon Bridge in Ghaziabad
 paanch log ghayal ho gaye, do auto or ek car kshitagrast ho gai
 Incidentally, our colleague Sushil Mahapatra had been preparing a report on hoardings in Delhi for several days
 susheel ne ise niyamon kii avhelnaa or gandagi kii nazar se dekha he magar iskaa ek paksh kaaphi khataranaak he
 Our colleague Sam Daniel has told that an archway was being built in the middle of the indestructible road of Coimbatore, even the workers who climb on it are not wearing helmets
 ye gir gaye to inkaa kya hoga aap samaj sakate hai
 Pits were dug in the roadway for this archway
 ye nazaaraa aap ghaziabad se lekar pune har jagah dekhte honge
 We understand that political parties are the owners of the country, wherever they want, they can put a photo of their leader
 hamaari haalat ye ho gai he ki ek din ye gharon main bhi hording lagaakar chale jaaenge or ham kuch nahin bol paaenge
 However, 30-year-old Raghu's bike stumbled from this archway or into the pit for the archway, Raghu fell and fell under a truck, died
 america se yah noujvaan apane honi vaali dulhan se milane aayaa tha
 Two families were devastated by this hoarding
 yah hording sattadhari eidiemke kaa tha, jo mjiaar ke janmashti samaaroh ke liye banaaya ja rahaa tha
 The truck driver has been arrested but the hoarder has not been arrested
 police kahati he ki raghupati ne helmet nahin pahana tha
 But whether there was hoarding according to the rules
 kya kisi bhi shahar main hording niyamon ke anusaar lagate hai
 People are expressing their anger over the incident on social media
 raghu ko kisne maaraa, hashtag chal rahaa he
 a huge archway was being built in the middle of the National Highway
 logon ne paint se likh diya he, raghu ko kisne maaraa

 The Hindu newspaper reported that on October 25 this year, the Madras High Court had ordered a cutout in the entire state
 hording, flax nahin lagenge
 The High Court had asked the Chief Secretary of the state to implement this order
 magar 'da kowai post' ne bataaya he ki coimbatore main hi kitne hording avaidh rup se bana die gaye hai
 a circular was issued on 16 May 2002 by Road Transport and Highways, clearly stating that no advertisement of hoardings is allowed on the highway, except for public interest related information
 kisi bhi shahar main dekhie, jise jahaan man karata he, vahaan hording laga detaa he
 Many times the redlight is not visible
 uske upar yuva netaa apana poster taang detaa he
 The poster contains photos of ten and twenty other leaders
 kai baar is tarah se tange rahete hai ki jaraa si aandhi chalati he, ye hording girane lagate hai

 6 may 2016 ko ghaziabad ke hindon brij ke paas ek bada sa hording gir gaya
 Five people were injured, two autos and a car were damaged
 ittfa se hamaare sahyogi susheel mahapatra kai dinon se dilli main hording par hi report taiyaar kar rahe the
 Sushil sees it as a violation of rules and a look of filth, but one side of it is quite dangerous
 america se yah noujvaan apane honi vaali dulhan se milane aayaa tha
 Two families were devastated by this hoarding

 hording, flax nahin lagenge
 The High Court had asked the Chief Secretary of the state to implement this order
 magar 'da kowai post' ne bataaya he ki coimbatore main hi kitne hording avaidh rup se bana die gaye hai
 a circular was issued on 16 May 2002 by Road Transport and Highways, clearly stating that no advertisement of hoardings is allowed on the highway, except for public interest related information
 kisi bhi shahar main dekhie, jise jahaan man karata he, vahaan hording laga detaa he

 Hoarding will not cause flakes
 hoicourt ne rajya ke mukhya sachiv se kaha tha ki is aadesh ko lagu karaaen

 Look in any city, wherever you like, it puts up hoardings

 Many times it hangs in such a way that a slight thunderstorm moves, these hoardings start falling

 a child named Krishna is also a member of the same, who is unhappy because of his circumstances, but later Lord Krishna himself appears to them

 Katrina Kaif also has some action scenes in this battle of Krishna
 krishna ab itnaa mashhoor ho chukaa he ki usase milane ruthik roshan bhi unke ghar aate hai
 The character of Lord Krishna is animated
 vaise to yah feechar film he, lekin lord krishna ke alaava film kaa kuch hissaa anemated he
 By the way, if the film had more of an animated part, the children might have enjoyed it more, because the dramatic story is not very impressive
 film main samaajik samasya, bacchon kaa shoshan or doodh main milawat jaise mudde to hai, lekin ye mudde bacchon ke lihaaj se kuch zyada aage ke hai
 The comments bacchon ko khush karne ke liye har cheez daalane kii koshish kii gai he phir vah chaahe anemated karactor ho, kamedi ho, ection ho, imoshan ho yaa ruthik or katrina jaise stars kii mehmaan bhoomika ho

 So the public should give him a note along with the vote

 The newspapers in Mumbai will soon feature interesting posters addressing the Parsi community
 postaron kaa lakshya aise parsi hai, jo shaadi kii umr paar karne ke baavjood avivaahit hai, yaa aise parsi jode, jo kinhin kaarnon se abhi tak santan paidaa nahin kar sake hai
 The pictures and messages of the posters are quite interesting
 masalan, ek kaali phiet gaadi par tike ek adhed parsi se poocha ja rahaa he, 'dada kii phiet, papa kii rolex ghadi kiske naam chhod jaaenge?' duusare poster main jahaan ek parsi maa apane bete ko naashtaa paros rahi he, vahaan sawaal likhaa he, 'kab tak maa ke pallu se bandhe rahoge?' While these photographs have tickled many Zoroastrians, some are watching it with surprise
 bharat main parsi samaaj kii girti taadaad se chintit parsi sansthaaon ne hi yah poster banavaakar parsi samaaj se apni loksankhya badhaane kii sidhi apil kii he
 The imagination behind these posters is also from Parsi artists
 mashhoor vigyaapan nirmaataa sam balsara kii company medisson india ke banaae in bebaaq postaron par balsara ne enditivi se kaha, "vigyaapan tabhi kargar hota he, jab vah kisi dukhati rag ko chedhta he
 Discussions and controversies may have spread over our posters, but perhaps this is the right way
 " postaron ke kirdaaron main parizaad zorabian or boman irani jaise parsi kalakaar bhi jhalkenge
 These posters turn some worrying figures into funny messages

 Nine per cent of the total number of Parsi community are beyond the age of sixty, in such a case, there was more noise in defending these posters
 andheri kii parsi colony main ham 30 saal ke deljad or 27 saal kii unki mangetar benaaj se mili
 Surprising and agreeable, Delzad described it as 'a good campaign and a fair message'
 benaaj or mukhar thim, vah boleen, "mujhamen parsi sanskaar kuta-kuta kar bhare hai, or kisi gaiyr-parsi se shaadi karne kaa sawaal hi nahin tha
 Although when and how many children are there, there is no such pressure from our families
 " But 29-year-old musician Kaizad Gharada does not seem completely convinced by this campaign
 unka kahana he ki samaaj ko is baat se zyada aapatti he ki kai yuva gaiyr-parsiyon se bhi shaadiyaan rachaa rahe hai
 Being a Zoroastrian is not just related to faith, there are strong views about dynasty and blood
 isi samaaj kii sankhya badhaane ke liye centre sarkaar ne bhi 10 karod rupee kii 'jeeyo parsi' jaisi yojana bhi banaai he, jisamen jaruratmand parsi jodon ko santan-prapti ke liye chikitsa sahaayta dilwaai jaati he, or yah haalia muhim isi yojana kii ore ishaara bhi karti he
 It is in the Afsans that the first Parsi representatives who came to India promised the rulers that the Parsi society would be absorbed into the Indian culture like sugar in milk, and now this society is reduced to thousands and is facing this fear
 , That Parsi sweetness should not disappear from Indian culture

 It should be written in the pledge, 'I will devote 100 hours every year, ie two hours a week in cleaning work
 main na hi khud gandagi failaaungaa or na hi dusron ko failaane duungaa
 Also, the pensioners have been asked to share pictures of their work

 It has been four years of the Modi government and four years of the Ministry of Railways
 is dauraan do kaabil netaaon ko rail mantri banane kaa mauka mila he
 First Suresh Prabhu and then Dynamic Piyush Goyal
 aapke jamaa tex se rail mantralay ke vigyapanon main na to train ke deree se chalane kaa detail hota he or na hi platform par thande pani kii karaab wedding mashin kaa
 Our partners and viewers are supporting this work
 bijepi ke saansad anshul verma ne bataaya ki muradabad mandal yani kai zilon ke platform par pani kii vending mashin karaab he
 So our colleague Anwar went to Moradabad station
 vahaan par ek parivaar ko shauchalay main band dekha
 You can say what's new in it
 is lihaaz se bharat main phir kuch bhi nayaa nahin he
 Neither the leader's lie is new nor his claim to change everything is new
 railway kii khidki se jhaankati bharat kii garibi
 The memory of your train journey will start running in the eyes of these children standing at the window
 mummy daddy ke saath kii gai rail yatra or wo windo seat par baithkar mahaan bharat ko guzarate dekhnaa
 Here these children standing stunned like a criminal must have been frightened by our camera that the camera moving towards them will not know
 kahin unhen chalati train se utarava to nahin degaa
 As soon as the camera approaches, peeping inside, it is revealed that it is not a coach, it is a toilet
 is shauchalay main aath logon kaa parivaar band he
 These eight people have neither seen the press conference of the Railway Minister on TV nor have seen the advertisements printed in the newspapers that the railway has turned around
 anwar ne donon shauchalay main dekha to log bhare pade the
 This train is called Akal Takht Express from Kolkata to Amritsar
 uttar bharat ke gaanvon se mazdoor jab shaharon kii taraf palaayan karata he to sabase pehle apni aant ko sukha letaa he taaki pakhaana peshaab kaa system mar jaae or jane kii naubat hi na aae
 Otherwise the general boarders cannot access the toilets
 sochie in logon ko english aati or inkaa twitor handle hota to ye log dinemic rail mantri ko kya twit karte or hamaara kuleen tabaka kaise pratikriya vyakt karata
 Sometimes you will survey about this from people walking in General Bogey
 vaise anwar ne dekha ki muradabad stesan par thande pani kii do do vending mashin karaab he
 We showed the Hardoi station how the water vending machine is bad for three months
 chaar paanch din dikhaane ke baad agar pani kii vending mashin thik nahin ho sakati he ou tab bhi aap media se ummid karte hai, aapaki ummiido ko bhi nobel puraskaar milanaa chahie
 Today we tell you the condition of Bareilly railway station
 yahaan bhi mashin karaab padi he
 There are seven machines at Bareilly station
 do ke alaava sab thapp padi hai
 It seems that a new type of machine is installed and a big change has come
 magar kareeb se isaki tonti sukhi he
 Passengers are taking water only from normal tap
 stesan par tainaat manager ke jawaab main spashtataa nahin he
 They say three machines are fine
 phir bhi chaar to karaab hai
 He also stated that the company had not deposited the money for 7 months
 ab jamaa kiya he to mashin jaldi thik karne ke nirdesh die gaye hai
 So you saw that the water vending machines at Hardoi and Bareilly stations are bad
 aapako lagata hoga ki ham yun hi dinemic rail mantri piyush goyal ke mantralay kii samiksha kar rahe hai
 Go to their twitter handle and see how people have reviewed their rail
 aap bataaiye train let hone se agar kisi chaatra kii zindagi barbaad ho jaae or aisi kai or kahaniyaan saamne aa jaaen tab hamen kya karnaa chahie
 a letter has arrived
 ek ladki kaa ames kii imtahaan chhot gaya
 Can someone get that girl a chance again, then i say that if you are going to take exams, or to join a job, get out of your house by foot or bullock cart a week before, do not go by rail
 sangeeta ke do saal ab koi nahin lautaa saktaa magar aaj kii shaam sangeeta kii barbaadi se kisi ko sahanubhuti nahin, sab yahi pataa kar rahe honge pranab mukherjee sangh mukhyalay ja rahe hai to desh kii raajnneeti main kya bhuuchaal aa rahaa he
 You must have understood how much politics of the country cares about the earthquake that occurs in the lives of the people
 aaiye let se chal rahi kuch gadiyon kii chaal par gaur karte hai
 We are telling you when we checked
 15212 jananaayak express 27 may ko 13 ghante 55 minute kii deree se khuli or raste main 21 ghante 52 minute let ho gai
 The 15910 Avadh Assam Express had run on May 26, 17 hours and 4 minutes late on reaching Barpeta Road station

 The passenger of the Vibhuti Express tweeted that this train covered a distance of 19 km in 3 hours
 12331 himgiri express ke ek yatri ne twit kiya he ki 3 maheene main iske let hone ke kaaran 4 baar flite chhot gai he
 On Monday night, Sealdah Rajdhani going from Sealdah to New Delhi was stoned near Gaya station, due to which the windows of more than 1 dozen coaches of the train were damaged
 ab turant to kuch kiya nahin ja saktaa tha isliye jab sava do baje sialdah rajdhani mughalsarai pahunchi to karmchaariyon ne khidakiyon par cartoon jiskaa sahi uccharan katan he or plastic chipkaakar kaamchalaoo intazaam kar diya taaki yatri manzil tak pahunch jaaen
 But there was no arrangement for the injured passengers
 hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ne bataaya he ki mughalsarai ek division he, railway ke kai bade adhikari yahaan rahete hai, itani badi ghatana hone ke baad bhi koi inkaa haal jaanane nahin pahunchaa
 Passengers told that for several hours a train was standing which was being stopped and passed to the capital
 yatri is baat ko lekar ugr ho gaye or rajdhani par patharav shuru kar diya
 There may be stone pelting on the capital, the passengers traveling in it did not even think
 jaise taise sabane apni jaan bachaai
 People should understand one thing
 deree se chalane ko lekar samasya he to isaki maang kiijie, na ki gussa rail ke coach par nikaaliye
 Understand your anger
 khud main jhankie ki kai saal se aapane yah bardaasht kaise kiya hua he ki bees bees ghante let train se chal rahe hai lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki pathar uthaakar coach par de maaraa
 Is embarrassing
 aaj subah subah uttar pradesh ke 1000 ejiniyaron kii taraf se messej aayaa ki pichley saal unki naukari chali gai he
 These people were ensuring the availability of internet and facility of video conferencing at district, block, tehsil level for 8 years
 is pariyojna kaa naam tha swaan
 All states had such projects
 inkaa kahana he ki upi sarkaar ne is yojana ko band kar diya he or inaki chuttee kar di he
 They also allege that the government used to give them 38,000 as salary but they used to get only Rs 15,000 from the company they used to give
 agar aisi lut hui he to isaki jaanch do minute main kii ja sakati he
 Many people complain that they sign on a salary of twenty thousand but they get 12,000 on hand
 is tarah kii lut bharat main hi sambhav he
 All such people who are being robbed should fight together
 apni ladaai khud bhi ladani padati he
 In the Income Tax Department, Excise Department, 3287 students have not received appointment letters yet
 das maheene se ye intazaar kar rahe hai
 We have been speaking in prime time daily for a week, but till date, Finance Minister Piyush Goyal, who is called Dynamic in the media, did not give him an appointment letter nor did he give any concrete answer to when
 somvaar ko kuch ladke daftar bhi gaye the magar kisi ne inase mulaakaat nahin kii
 i am telling all this so that the advertisements that the government gets printed with the tax money given to you, the ministers who hold press conferences in every state and district, all these things are not told or asked
 tippaniyan In prime time, through the Ambedkar University in North Bihar, we have proposed a political theory that if the state wishes, it can put five to six lakh youth in the same class for two years without examination
 yuvaaon main raajnneetik chetana or urja ek myth or bogus avadharana he
 Really the condition of these students is very bad
 ye din bhar uniwarsity daudte rahete hai
 Nobody listens to them
 aap kareeb se dekhege to ro denge
 Millions of students of Jai Prakash Narayan University were sitting in the same class without examination
 ve apni barbaadi ko itnaa hi mahatv de sake ki unhone bahut mehnat kar mujhe whatsap messej kiya ki pariksha nahin ho rahi he
 How hardworking our students have become
 2015-18, 2016-19, 2017-20 batch ke chaatro kaa ek saal kaa bhi imtahaan nahin hua he
 On this, the people of Harvard University, Cambridge University should do research on how millions of students of Bihar state are living without examination
 sirf 2013-16 batch ke teenon saal kaa imtahaan hua he
 Jayaprakash Narayan University met on 24 March
 tay hua ki is saal ke ant tak sabhi parikshaayen ho jaaengi
 You can also add Bihar University to it
 isliye kahata hum ki duniya ke tamaam vishvavidhyalayon se research scoler ko bihar aakar adhyayan karnaa chahie ki june se disambar yani chah maheene main 6 saal ke koi paanch das lakh chaatr kaise imtahaan denge
 This is going to be the biggest examination event in the world
 agar vaaki chah maheene main saare imtahaan hue to iskaa matlab ki koi padhai nahin hogi, sirf or sirf pariksha hogi
 Poverty of India peeping through the railway window
 khidki par khadey in bacchon kii ankhon main hamaari aapaki rail yatra kii smriti daudane lagati hogi
 Rail journey with Mummy Daddy and watching him pass through the great India by sitting on the window seat
 yahaan kisi apradhi kii tarah stabdh khadey ye bachche hamaare camere se bhay hi kha gaye honge ki unki taraf badhane vaala camera na jane kya karegaa
 Will they get them off the moving train? camera jaise jaise nazadik pahunchataa he, bheetar jhaankta he to pataa chalata he ki yah coach nahin he, shauchalay he
 The family of eight people is closed in this toilet
 in aath logon ne tivi par na to rail mantri kii press conference dekhi he or na hi akhabaaron main chapa vigyaapan dekha he ki railway kaa turn around ho gaya he
 When Anwar saw both the toilets, people were full
 yah train kolkata se amritsar jane vaali akaal takht express kehalaati he
 When the laborers migrate from the villages of North India to the cities, they first dry their intestines so that the food system of the pakhana dies and there is no chance of leaving
 varanaa general bogi main savaar log shauchalay tak pahunch hi nahin sakate hai
 Imagine if these people knew English and had a Twitter handle, what would they tweet to the Dynamic Railway Minister and how would our elite section react
 kabhi aap general bogi main chalane vaale logon se is bare main survey kijiega
 However, Anwar noticed that two to two cold water vending machines at Moradabad station are defective
 hamane hardoi stesan kaa dikhaaya ki kaise pani kii vendish mashin teen maheene se kharaab he
 After four to five days of showing, if the water vending machine cannot be fixed and still you expect from the media, your expectations should also get the Nobel Prize
 aaj ham aapako bareli railway stesan kaa haal bataate hai
 Here too the machine is defective
 bareli stesan par saat mashine hai
 All but two have come to a standstill
 dekhne se lagata he ki nai tip kii mashin lagi he or bada baari badlaav aa gaya he
 But its spout is dry at close range
 yatri saamaanya nal se hi pani le rahe hai
 There is no clarity in the response of the manager posted at the station
 ve kehete hai teen mashine thik hai
 Still four are bad
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki 7 maheene se company ne paisa nahin jamaa kiya tha
 Now deposited, instructions have been given to fix the machine quickly
 to aapane dekha ki hardoi or bareli stesan kii pani kii vending mashin karaab he
 You would think that we are reviewing the Ministry of Dynamic Railways Minister Piyush Goyal
 aap unke twinter handle par jaakar dekhie logon ne unke rail kii kisi samiksha kar rakhi he
 Tell me, what should we do if a student's life is ruined due to the delay of the train and many more such stories are revealed
 ek patr aayaa he
 a girl missed the examination of AIIMS
 kya us ladki ko koi dobaaraa mauka dilava saktaa he, tabhi kahata hum ki agar aap pariksha dene ja rahe hon, yaa naukari jwine karne ja rahe hon to apane ghar se ek haftaa pehle paidal yaa baiylgaadee se nikal lijie, rail se mat jaaiye
 No one can return for two years of Sangeeta, but no one is sympathetic to Sangeeta's ruin this evening, everyone must be knowing that Pranab Mukherjee is going to the Sangh headquarters, so what is going on in the country's politics
 janata kii zindagi main jo bhuuchaal aata he uske bare main desh kii raajnneeti kitni parvaah karti he aap samaj gaye honge
 Let us look at the speed of some trains running late
 hamane jab check kiya tha tab ke hisaab se ham bataa rahe hai
 15212 Jannayak Express opened on May 27 with a delay of 13 hours 55 minutes and was delayed 21 hours 52 minutes on the way
 15910 avadh assam express 26 may ko chali thi, barpeta road stesan pahunchate pahunchate 17 ghante 4 minute let ho chuki thi
 22405 Bhagalpur Anand Vihar Garib Rath 26 May train has reached Anandvihar on 28 May, 26 hours 8 minutes late
 04403 barauni anand vihaar asi express special
 The train on 26 May reached Anand Vihar on 28 May 19 hours 5 minutes late
 19602 nai jalpaigudi udaipur express, 28 may kii train raste main hi 16 ghante 26 minute let ho chuki thi
 12334 allahabad-howrah-bound Vibhuti Express 26 train reached Howrah 17 hours 48 minutes
 vibhuti express ke yatri ne twit kiya he ki is train ne 19 kimi kii duuri 3 ghante main tay kii
 a passenger of 12331 Himgiri Express has tweeted that it has missed 4 flights due to its delay in 3 months
 somvaar kii raat gaya stesan ke paas sialdah se nai dilli ja rahi sialdah rajdhani par patharav ho gaya, jiske kaaran train ke 1 darjan se adhik bogiyon kii khidkiyaan kshatigrast ho gayi
 Now nothing could be done immediately, so when Sealdah reached the capital Mughalsarai at two o'clock in the morning, the employees made cartoons with correct pronunciation cotton on the windows and made a stop-gap arrangement by sticking plastic so that the passengers could reach the destination
 magar ghayal yatriyon ke liye koi vyavastha nahin thi
 Our colleague Ajay Singh has told that Mughalsarai is a division, many big railway officials live here, no one came to know about them even after such a big incident
 yatriyon ne bataaya ki kai ghanton se koi train khadi thi jise roak kar rajdhani ko paas karaayaa ja rahaa tha
 Passengers became furious with this and started throwing stones at the capital
 rajdhani par patharav ho saktaa he, usamen safar kar rahe yatriyon ne sochaa bhi nahin tha
 Like how everyone saved their lives
 logon ko ek baat samajni chahie
 If there is a problem with running late, then demand it, rather take out the anger on the train coach
 apane gusse ko samajhie
 Look into yourself how you have tolerated for many years that you are running for twenty hours on a late train, but that does not mean picking up a stone and hitting the coach
 sharmnaak he
 This morning, a message came from 1000 engineers of Uttar Pradesh that their job had gone away last year

 If such a robbery has taken place, it can be investigated in two minutes
 bahut se log aisi shikaayat karte hai ki ve sin bees hazaar kii selary par karte hai magar haath main 12,000 miltaa he
 Such loot is possible only in India
 jitne bhi aise log luute ja rahe hai un sabko milakar ladanaa chahie
 We have to fight our own battles also

 That is why i say that research scholars from all the universities of the world should come to Bihar and study how six million students of 6 years will test in six months from June to December
 yah duniya main pariksha kaa sabase bada event hone ja rahaa he
 If indeed all the examinations took place in six months, then it means that there will be no studies, only and only examination

 Let us look at the speed of some trains running late
 hamane jab check kiya tha tab ke hisaab se ham bataa rahe hai
 15212 Jannayak Express opened on May 27 with a delay of 13 hours 55 minutes and was delayed 21 hours 52 minutes on the way
 15910 avadh assam express 26 may ko chali thi, barpeta road stesan pahunchate pahunchate 17 ghante 4 minute let ho chuki thi
 22405 Bhagalpur Anand Vihar Garib Rath 26 May train has reached Anandvihar on 28 May, 26 hours 8 minutes late

 Now nothing could be done immediately, so when Sealdah reached the capital Mughalsarai at two o'clock in the morning, the employees made cartoons with correct pronunciation cotton on the windows and made a stop-gap arrangement by sticking plastic so that the passengers could reach the destination
 magar ghayal yatriyon ke liye koi vyavastha nahin thi
 Our colleague Ajay Singh has told that Mughalsarai is a division, many big railway officials live here, no one came to know about them even after such a big incident
 yatriyon ne bataaya ki kai ghanton se koi train khadi thi jise roak kar rajdhani ko paas karaayaa ja rahaa tha
 Passengers became furious with this and started throwing stones at the capital
 rajdhani par patharav ho saktaa he, usamen safar kar rahe yatriyon ne sochaa bhi nahin tha
 Like how everyone saved their lives
 logon ko ek baat samajni chahie
 If there is a problem with running late, then demand it, rather take out the anger on the train coach
 apane gusse ko samajhie
 Look into yourself how you have tolerated for many years that you are running for twenty hours on a late train, but that does not mean picking up a stone and hitting the coach
 sharmnaak he
 This morning, a message came from 1000 engineers of Uttar Pradesh that their job had gone away last year

 The name of this project was SWAN

 They say that the UP government has stopped the scheme and discharged it
 inkaa ye bhi aarope he ki sarkaar inhen vetan ke rup main 38,000 detii thi magar jis company ko detii thi usase unhen 15000 rupee hi milte the
 If such a robbery has taken place, it can be investigated in two minutes
 bahut se log aisi shikaayat karte hai ki ve sin bees hazaar kii selary par karte hai magar haath main 12,000 miltaa he
 Such loot is possible only in India
 jitne bhi aise log luute ja rahe hai un sabko milakar ladanaa chahie

 They continue to run throughout the day

 If you look closely you will cry
 jai prakaash narayan uniwarsity ke lakhon chaatr bina pariksha ke ek hi class main baithe the
 He was able to give importance to his waste so much that he worked hard and messaged me on whatsapp that the exam is not going on

 The students of the 2015-18, 2016-19, 2017-20 batch have not been tested for even a year

 jaiprakash narayan uniwarsity kii 24 march ko baithak hui thi
 It was decided that by the end of this year all the examinations will be done
 isamen aap bihar uniwarsity ko bhi jod lijie
 That is why i say that research scholars from all the universities of the world should come to Bihar and study how six million students of 6 years will test in six months from June to December
 yah duniya main pariksha kaa sabase bada event hone ja rahaa he
 If indeed all the examinations took place in six months, then it means that there will be no studies, only and only examination

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has attacked the Delhi Police strongly, saying that the security of the state is trustworthy and the police does not even listen to the ministers
 kejariwal ne malviya nagar ke esechao or asipi ke alaava sagarpur esechao ko suspend karne ke liye bhi kaha or saath hi chetavanee bhi di
 Kejriwal said, 'delhi Police does not listen to even ministers
 agar mantriyon ke saath police aisa karti he to sawaal uthta he ki kya dilli surakshit he
 The security of Delhi is trustworthy
 parason jo rape hua, dilli police compromiging he or agar police kii javabdehi tay nahin kii gai to aparaadh kam nahin honge
 We warn the Delhi Police Commissioner that all policemen involved in these cases should be suspended
 agar inhen suspend nahin kiya jaataa to sarkaar or dilli kii janata donon hi chup baithne vaali nahin he
 Sagarpur SHO in addition to SHO and ACP of Malviya Nagar should be suspended
 'kejariwal ne kaha, 'dilli police kahati he ki mantri hastkshep karte hai, kya dilli police kaa kaam drug racket chalaane waalon, sex racket chalaane waalon or balaatkaariyon ko pakadana nahin he? main dilli ke police kamishnar se baat karuunga, aaj wo chuttee par hai
 'what happened to Somnath Bharti

 jab main aspataal main usase milane gai to usne bataaya ki maine khud ko aag nahin lagaai, mere sasur ne mujhapar tel chhidaka or meri saas or jethaani ne aag lagaai
 He told me that the police is not taking any action

 His batting line up is very good and he snatched the match from us
 is pich par 180 ran kaa lakshya hasil kiya ja saktaa tha lekin baaki 40 ran tak pahunchnaa mushkil tha
 Sehwag, however, praised his players for which the team topped the league table in the league stage
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe vishwaas nahin tha ki play aaf main aisa hoga lekin mujhe apane khilaadiyon or sahyogi staff par garv he jinke kaaran ham lig charan main sheersh par rahe
 We will try to do well in the Champions League now

 We had ordered a vigilance inquiry, the CBI director refused to take the case at that time
 hamaara aparaadh yahi he kii hamane sabase pehle kaha ki CAG ko hathkadi lagani chahie
 Judge - Why have you been framed? Lalu - Poaching
 
 Because i was trying to bring people from the lower classes to the mainstream

 magar is shahar ko banane main gaiyr marathi bhashiyon kaa bhi bahut yogadan he
 Parsis, Gujaratis, laborers from North India, people from South working in the office

 Bala is saying that the people of UP Bihar are criminal

 Where is it appropriate to associate criminal with provinciality
 janata ke sawalsawaalah rape par abu azmi kya apane coment par afsos karte hai

 Sanjay Nirupam: His daughter-in-law and son had opposed this matter
 abu ajamihsabko aazaadee he
 i think that immoral relationships should not be formed

 You give a speech in a circle of votes

 Do you not appreciate human life? balahkoi bhi ho, puri keemat he
 This is a wrong charge

 The government said that through this scheme, the government is extending the benefits of many welfare schemes to the public

 unic idantity number hone se yah sunishchit ho sakegaa ki jo benifit transfar kiya ja rahaa he, vah sahi va niyat benificiari ke paas ja rahaa he or is tarah ghost or dupliket system se delit ho jaaenge
 The central government said that if the direct benefit transfer program is transferred on the basis of bank account number and the benefit is given, it will be difficult to locate fake and ghost or duplication and thus bypassing the middleman and wrongful beneficiary
 Will be difficult
 tippaniyan If the Unique Identity Scheme is not mandated for direct benefit transfer, the system will continue to suffer major drawbacks and the system will be easily exploited by intermediaries and people with vested interests divert the benefit to themselves

 ekta kapur ne kaha- ''roak se or badi chahat kii upaj hogi
 In such a situation, the situation will become painful
 kai saare log mujhase poochhate hai ki aap itani bold kaise hai? is sandarbh main maine hameshaa se ye kaha he ki mujhe sex se koi samasya nahin he
 "ekta said," If the acter is not worried about the fact that people will see me in this way and those who see it also have no objection
 to phir mujhe nahin lagata ki koi samasya khadi honi chahie
 This is an agreed thing from both sides
 agar shaadi main bhi sahmati keval ek taraf se he to ise krime mana janaa chahie
 Sex is not an issue, rather it is an issue of imposing oneself on someone

Less pain more love n dependability ❤️A post shared byerk❤️rek (@ektaravikapoor) onmay 6, 2019 at 9:42 pm PDT If a decision is taken on control of digital platform, what will Ekta Kapoor stand for? The producer said, "who are we to take the stand?" ve stand lenge or ham use follow karenge
 But my view is clear on this
 mere hisaab se kisi bhi cheez par roak lagaana us cheez ke liye ek badi jarurat paidaa kar detii he
 This is a human mindset
 '' Coming in an aggressive posture, Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday targeted Narendra Modi and said that 'the real face is hidden in the mask'
 unhone modi ke kareebi sahyogi amit shah kii 'badla' sambandhi tippanee par unhen aade haath lete hue kaha ki bhaajapa kaa ek sutri agenda sampradayakita failaana he
 Sonia also alleged in Karnataka election rallies in Karnataka, indirectly referring to the case of alleged spying of a young woman by Gujarat police officers in 2009 that women were being tortured in the state
 modi dwaara baar baar ullekh kiye jane vaale vikaas ke gujarat model kii aalochana karte hue unhone kaha ki kuch logon ko choti baton ko bade dhang se pesh karne kii aisi aadat he maanon anya rajyon main koi acha kaam nahin ho rahaa he
 In Kolar, he said, 'these days you can see that big and expensive advertisements are being displayed all over the country and there is an attempt to hide the truth
 ' The Congress president attacked Modi without naming Modi, saying, 'an attempt is being made to cover the real face of a person through a mask
 unhen sabhi samasyaon ke ilaaj ore desh ke liye jaadugar ke rup main pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 ' congress adhyaksh ne bhaajapa par apni galatiyon ko chhipaane ke liye bhaaiyon ke bich ghrinaa failaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 He said that such efforts are being made to break the social fabric of the society
 unhone mysore main apni raily main kaha, 'congress ne hameshaa sampradayik sadbhaav ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye ladaai ladi lekin bhaajapa kaa ekmaatr agenda sampradayikta failaana he jo uttar pradesh main unke ek netaa ke bayaan se ujagar ho gaya he
 His real face is revealed once again
 ' Sonia's indirect reference was to the controversy that arose from Shah's statement
 shah ne kaha ki aam chunaav visheshkar pashchim uttar pradesh main 'sammaan kaa chunaav he
 It is an election to avenge the insult
 chunaav main un logon ko sabak sikhaaya janaa chahie jinhone anyaay kiya he
 ' samprag adhyaksh ne kaha ki 2014 kaa chunaav pehle se kahin adhik mahatvapurn he kyonki isse tay hoga ki ham kis tarah kaa bharat chaahate hai
 He said, 'on one hand, the Congress believes in democracy, believes in the ganga-jamuni culture of India, believes in secular values and looks at all citizens with one eye and wants to keep the society united
 aisi congress ke liye ham is chunaav main vot maang rahe hai
 'congress chief said,'
 
 And there is BJP which is seeking votes for one person
 jiskaa bharat kii ganga jamuni tahjeeb main koi bharosa nahin he
 ' manaregaa evam artiai jaisi pramukh yojanaon par samprag ke daavon par sawaal uthaane vaale modi par palatwaar karte hue sonia ne vipakshiyon par galat aarope lagane kaa doshaaropan kiya
 He said that MNREGA increased opportunities for the workers and created a new ray of hope in the lives of the workers
 'bhrashtachar main aakanth duube hamaare virdohi hamaare viruddh aarope laga rahe hai lekin ve aapako yah nahin bataayenge ki bhrashtachar ko mitaane ke liye congress party artiai lekar aayi
 ' sonia ne kaha, 'hamane bhandaphod karne waalo ko kanoonee sangrakshan diya
 He said that all this is not digesting the BJP
 modi ne kal karnataka main apni raily main manaregaa ke sambandh main aarope lagaaya tha ki 'isane keval congress kii jebon ko bharaa he
 Attacking the Gujarat model, Sonia alleged that the poor, the underprivileged and the minorities have sacrificed enough and children are dying of malnutrition and tribals are facing difficulties in living
 kisaanon se gujarat main jameen jabardastee adhigrahit kii ja rahi he tathaa mahilaon ko bhi 'vibhinn tarah kii pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 This is his real picture
 ' They said, '
 
 They do not believe in unity in diversity, they divided hearts and made brothers fight against each other
 kripaya mujhe bataaiye ki kya aise logon se raashtra nirmaan kii ummid kar sakate hai jo hamaare dharmanirpeksh siddhant kii buniyaad main hi bharosa nahin karte
