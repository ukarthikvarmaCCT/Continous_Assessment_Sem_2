 If you are potato farmer, poor people, laborer then you should also take part in the survey
 survey ke sawaal par bhi sawaal hua he, lekin pradhanmantri ne is aitihaasik bhagidaari ke liye sabakaa aabhaar jataayaa he
 Recall where all the tantrums, the bulls of the Lokpal era have become

 New political loyalties were being formed

 Recall what happened to the debates during Lokpal's time
 aam aadmi party ne centre ke lokapal ko sweekaar nahin kiya or apana janalokapal banane kaa elaan kar diya
 On 4 December 2015, the Delhi Jan Lokpal Bill was passed in the Delhi Legislative Assembly
 isaki bhi aalochana hui
 It was said that when Chief Minister Kejriwal used to agitate, he used to say that if there will be more leaders in the appointment of Lokpal, then it cannot work honestly
 lekin jab dilli kaa janalokapal aayaa to usamen netaa hi zyaada the
 When it was criticized, former Chief Justice of Delhi High Court was also included at the behest of Anna
 janalokapal bill paas hokar bhi lagu nahin hua he
 Nearly a year has passed for this too
 philhal dilli main lokayukta hai
 The comments donon daur ko yaad kiijie
 There was so much pride among the leaders
 bhrashtachar ko mitaane vaala lokapal aayaa bhi nahin
 But during this time many laws were made to fight corruption, SIT was made
 aghoshit sampatti ghoshit karne kii yojana ai
 Demonetisation came, but the post of Lokpal remained vacant
 notebandi se hone vaali pareshaaniyon or sarkaar kii lachar taiyaariyon ke khilaaf vipaksh ne 28 november ko deshvyapee aakrosh diwas kaa elaan kiya he
 At that time also, on 23 August 2011, on the call of Anna Hazare, 9 opposition parties of non-nda supported the nationwide movement
 lokapal nahin aayaa ye ek tathy he par aisa nahin he ki sarkaar lokapal kanoon ke bare main bhul hi gai
 The same Hindu newspaper reported on 27 July 2016 that the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha have passed the Lokpal and Lokayukta Amendment Bill 2016
 magar is sanshodhan kaa sambadh lokapal kii niyukti ke liye chayan samiti kii sharton ko badalanaa nahin tha
 You know that the Leader of the Selection Committee should be the Opposition but the Leader in the Lok Sabha is not the Opposition
 isliye niyukti nahin ho rahi he
 The amendment that was passed on 27 July was because by 31 July the authorities had to submit the details of the property of themselves and their families
 adhikariyon ke alaava enjio ke board member or trustee ko bhi sampatti kaa byora dena tha
 The amendment extended the July 31 deadline
 is vakt bhi bhrashtachar ko mitaane kii khub daavedaariyaan ho rahi hai
 It is being said that only the rich are corrupt, but the survey at that time asked about five categories of which are the most corrupt - government, elected representatives, judiciary, businessmen, industrialists, ngos and media
 survey main shaamil 32 fisadi logon ne kaha tha ki sarkaar sabase bhrasht he or 43 fisadi logon ne kaha tha ki chune hue netaa sabase bhrasht hai
 Similar surveys are also being conducted these days
 notebandi ke baad mukhya sawaal yahi ho gaya he ki aap sarkaar ke faisle se khush hai yaa nahin
 Survey questions are around this
 tab lokapal ko log bhrashtachar kaa muktidaata maan kar survey main shaamil ho rahe the, ab use bhul kar log notebandi ko nayaa muktidaata maanane lage hai
 Even then there were the same people, still the same people
 kya lokapal kii tarah kuch sawaal is tarah se puche ja sakate hai jaise -kya aap jaanate hai ki kaala dhan kaise kaise banataa he? Do you know what are the types of black money other than cash notes? kya aap jaanate hai ki farji company banaakar duusare deshon main paisa rakhaa jaataa he? Do you believe that black money will be eradicated only by demonetisation? lokapal ke samay yah poocha gaya ki aap iske bare main kitna jaanate hai
 At the time of demonetisation it should also be asked what you know about black money
 ab har koi yahi puch rahaa he ki kya aap sarkaar ke faisle ke saath hai? kam se kam mukhya sawaal to yahi he ki kya aap sarkaar ke faisle ke saath hai? bhrashtachar ke khilaaf karrwai kaa virodh wo bhi nahin karegaa jo bhrashtachar main shaamil he
 There are surveys of 'dainik Jagran' and 'hindustan'
 19 november ke 'dainik jaagran' ke survey kaa pehla sawaal he ki is kadam se hone vaali pareshaani ke baavjood aap iske paksh main hai? is survey main shaamil 86
 1 percent people said that yes
 kya bade note band karke sarkaar ne sahi kadam uthaaya he- 84
 8 percent of the people have said that they have taken the right steps
 chauthaa sawaal he ki kya isse kaala dhan samaapt ho jayega or aage iske raste band ho jaaenge
 In response to this, there is a huge change in the opinion of the people
 25 pratishat log kehete hai ki sahamat nahin hai, 67
 2 percent say they agree

 The survey of Hindustan shows that the supporters of demonetisation decreased continuously in the last ten days
 8 november ko hi hindustan ke survey main 78 fisadi logon ne samarthan kiya tha
 Seven days later the number of supporters decreased to 61
 93 pratishat ho gai
 After 10 days, the number of supporters reduced to 46 percent
 times aaf india ne bhi 22 november ko si-voter kaa ek survey chapa he jiske anusaar 80 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki ve notebandi se hone vaali takalifon kii parvaah nahin karte
 The whole question is whether the supporters of the verdict or care about the suffering caused by it

 In 2011, a survey was conducted in Old Delhi and Model Town regarding what the Lokpal should be like

 At the time of Lokpal it was asked how much you know about it
 notebandi ke samay bhi poocha janaa chahie ki aap kaala dhan ke bare main kya jaanate hai
 Now everyone is asking, are you with the decision of the government? At least the main question is, are you with the government's decision? Action against corruption will not oppose anyone who is involved in corruption
 'dainik jaagran' or 'hindustan' ke survey hai
 The first question of the survey of 'dainik Jagran' of 19 November is that despite the problems caused by this step, are you in favor of it? 86 included in this survey
 1 pratishat logon ne kaha he ki haa hai
 Has the government taken the right step by closing big notes - 84
 8 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki sahi kadam uthaaya he
 The fourth question is whether this will eliminate black money and further stop its path
 iske jawaab main logon kii raay main baari badlaav dikhataa he

 2 fisadi kehete hai ki sahamat hai
 While 84 percent of those who consider the government's move to be good
 8 or 86

 20 november ko hindi akhbaar dainik hindustan main ek survey prakashit hota he
 In Jagran's survey, the percentage of those who show good steps is 85 or more
 hindustan kaa survey bataata he ki pichley das din main notebandi ke samarthak lagaataar kam hue
 On 8 November, 78 per cent of the people in the survey of Hindustan supported
 saat din baad samarthakon kii sankhya ghatakar 61
 93 percent
 10 din baad samarthakon kii sankhya ghat kar 46 pratishat ho gai
 The Times of India also conducted a c-voter survey on November 22, according to which 80 per cent people said that they do not care about the problems caused by demonetisation
 sara sawaal isi par he ki faisle ke samarthak hai yaa isse hui takalif ko parvaah karte hai yaa nahin
 It was during the Anna movement that Arvind Kejriwal started a referendum on every aspect related to the Lokpal
 2011 main lokapal kaisaa hona chahie ise lekar puraani dilli or model toun main survey kara diya gaya tha
 There was a lot of mockery then that the law was made by the discretion of the Parliament or by such a survey with missed calls
 notebandi ke daur main yahi survey phir se laut aae hai
 The Prime Minister has released an app on which ten questions have been asked about black money
 bhartiya itihaas kaa itnaa bada faisla
 In the same way, it was said about the Lokpal and these surveys raised questions
 us samay kejariwal survey karke dilli ke auto par chipka dete the
 Those surveys used to be mocked, questions were asked
 sansad ke bheetar sharad yadav kaha karte the ki kanoon sadan ke vivek se banegaa
 Not from TV debate and survey
 vaise 24 ghante ke bheetar pradhanmantri ke ap par paanch lakh se zyada logon ne vot kar diya he
 Two questions have polled 98 and 99 percent support
 agar aap aalu kisaan hai, garib janata hai, mazdoor hai to aapako bhi survey main hissaa lenaa chahie
 The question of the survey has also been questioned, but the Prime Minister has thanked everyone for this historic partnership
 yaad kiijie lokapal ke daur kii wo tamaam talkhiyaan, teziyaan kahaan hawa ho gayi hai
 Friends and friends started fighting among themselves
 nai raajnneetik nishthaaen ban rahi thim
 Is all of that happening again? kya notebandi ke baad se aap or aapke mitra samooh main bahesbaazi tej nahin hui he
 It must have happened
 yaad kiijie lokapal ke vakt kii bahason kaa kya hua
 The Aam Aadmi Party did not accept the Lokpal of the Center and announced to make it its Jan Lokpal
 4 disambar 2015 ko dilli vidhansabha main dilli janalokapal bill paas ho gaya
 It was also criticized
 kaha gaya ki jab mukhyamantri kejariwal andolan karte the tab kehete the ki lokapal kii niyukti main netaa zyaada honge to eemaandaaree se kaam nahin kar saktaa he
 But when Janlokpal of Delhi came, there were more leaders in it
 jab isaki aalochana hui to anna ke kehane par dilli hoicourt ke purv chif justise ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya
 The Jan Lokpal bill has not been implemented even after passing
 iske bhi paas hue kareeb ek saal hone ko aa gaye hai
 Currently, there are Lokayuktas in Delhi
 tippaniyan Recall both rounds
 netaaon main kitna ghamaasan hota tha
 The Lokpal to eradicate corruption did not even come
 lekin is dauraan bhrashtachar se ladane ke liye kai kanoon bane, esaiti bani
 The plan came to declare undisclosed assets
 notebandi aa gai, magar lokapal kaa pad khaali rah gaya
 Opposition has declared a nationwide outrage day on 28 November against the troubles caused by demonetisation and the government's poor preparations
 us vakt bhi yani 23 agast 2011 ko anna hazaare ke aahwan par gaiyr endie ke 9 vipakshi dalon ne rashtravyapee andolan kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Lokpal did not come, it is a fact but it is not that the government forgot about the Lokpal Act
 isi 27 july 2016 ke hindu akhbaar kii report he ki rajya sabha or loksabhaa ne lokapal or lokayukta sanshodhan bill 2016 paas kar diya he
 But this amendment did not change the terms of the selection committee for the appointment of Lokpal
 aap jaanate hai ki chayan samiti main netaa vipaksh hona chahie magar loksabhaa main netaa vipaksh nahin he
 Therefore, the appointment is not taking place
 27 july ko jo sanshodhan paas hua wo isliye tha ki 31 july tak adhikariyon ko apni or apane parijanon kii sampatti kaa byora jamaa karnaa tha
 Apart from the officials, the board members and trustees of the NGO were also required to give details of the assets
 sanshodhan ke zariye 31 july kii samay seemaa badha di gai

 The Lokpal to eradicate corruption did not even come
 lekin is dauraan bhrashtachar se ladane ke liye kai kanoon bane, esaiti bani
 The plan came to declare undisclosed assets
 notebandi aa gai, magar lokapal kaa pad khaali rah gaya
 Opposition has declared a nationwide outrage day on 28 November against the troubles caused by demonetisation and the government's poor preparations
 us vakt bhi yani 23 agast 2011 ko anna hazaare ke aahwan par gaiyr endie ke 9 vipakshi dalon ne rashtravyapee andolan kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Lokpal did not come, it is a fact but it is not that the government forgot about the Lokpal Act
 isi 27 july 2016 ke hindu akhbaar kii report he ki rajya sabha or loksabhaa ne lokapal or lokayukta sanshodhan bill 2016 paas kar diya he
 But this amendment did not change the terms of the selection committee for the appointment of Lokpal
 aap jaanate hai ki chayan samiti main netaa vipaksh hona chahie magar loksabhaa main netaa vipaksh nahin he
 Therefore, the appointment is not taking place
 27 july ko jo sanshodhan paas hua wo isliye tha ki 31 july tak adhikariyon ko apni or apane parijanon kii sampatti kaa byora jamaa karnaa tha
 Apart from the officials, the board members and trustees of the NGO were also required to give details of the assets
 sanshodhan ke zariye 31 july kii samay seemaa badha di gai

 The monsoon session of Parliament ended on Friday
 20 din ke is satr main sansad kii kaarywahi 13 din baadhit rahi
 While Prime Minister Manmohan Singh slammed the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the deadlock, the BJP termed its performance as part of democracy
 sansad ke baahar samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main manmohan singh ne sansad ko lagaataar thap rakhane ke liye bhaajapa par prahaar karte hue shuukravaar ko kaha, "hamen garv karnaa chahie ki hamaare paas ek kaaryshil loktantr he
 But what we saw in this session is totally a negative aspect of it
 " unhone kaha, "is desh main sabhi sahi soch rakhane waalon ko uth khadaa hona chahie or sanyukt rup se yah aawaaj buland kerani chahie ki un sansadeey sansthaaon main niyamon ke anuroop kaamkaaj chalane diya jaae, jinhen ham desh ke aaazaad hone ke samay se hi jaanate hai
 " sansad kaa monsoon satr shuukravaar ko anischitkaal ke liye sthagit kar diya gaya
 The BJP, seeking the Prime Minister's resignation, did not even allow the proceedings on the last day of the session to go on
 is tarah 20 dinon ke is satr main kaarywahi 13 din baadhit rahi
 BJP was adamant that the Prime Minister had charge of the Ministry of Coal at the time the coal blocks were allotted, so Manmohan Singh should resign, taking moral responsibility
 bhaajapa ne niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak (sieji) kii jis report ko apni maang kaa aadhaar banaaya he, us par tippanee karte hue manmohan singh ne kaha ki vah bharat ke aadhikarik ankekshak ko atyant sammaan karte hai lekin unki report par sansad main charchaa kerani hogi
 He said, "we highly respect the CAG as an institution
 hamen unke tathyon par lok lekha samiti main tathaa sansad main bahes kerani chahie
 We have always been expressing this wish
 " Continuing the attack on the BJP, the Prime Minister said, "the opposition chose the way that no one should get the benefit of the scheduled institutional work on the pretext of the CAG report and hence it was adamant on disrupting Parliament
" " Manmohan Singh said, "this is the downside of democracy
 yadi is dharna ko badhaava diya gaya to yah sansadeey loktantr ke niyamon kaa ulanghan hoga
 "he said," India has many problems
 kahin badhate sampradayik tanaav kii samasya he to kahin kshetreey or jaateey tanaav kii samasya he
 Somewhere there is the problem of terrorism and Naxalism
 in muddon par bahes honi chahie lekin desh ke samaksh in atyant mahatvapurn muddon par charchaa nahin karne di gai
 " pradhanmantri ne yah bhi kaha ki mandi ke kaaran samoochaa vishwa gambheer aarthik kathinaaiyon kaa saamana kar rahaa he or ham prayasarat hai ki bahari duniya main jo kuch ho rahaa he, uskaa prabhaav bharat par na padane den
 He said, "these issues should have been discussed in Parliament as to what should be our economic strategy for dealing with global tensions and development
" " Manmohan said, "none of these were allowed in Parliament
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki sansad jo ek manch he, jis par ham logon kii jaruraton or unki aprasannataa par bebaak raay rakhte hai, use puri tarah pangu bana diya gaya
 " gyaat ho ki sieji kii report main koyala block aavanton ke liye nilaamee kii prakriya na apnaane par sarkaar kii aalochana kii gai he or kaha gaya he ki is kaaran kendriya rajkosh ko 1
 There was a loss of 86 lakh crore rupees ($ 37 billion)
 vahiin pradhanmantri ke prahaar par palatwaar karte hue bhaajapa kaha ki 'pradarshan bhi loktantr kaa hissaa he
 ' bhaajapa netaa sushamaa swaraj ne kaha, "main pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko yaad dilaanaa chaahati hum ki jab vah rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa the, to unhone bhi tahalaka ke mudde par sansad kii kaarywahi baadhit kii thi
 Even in the coffin scam, he interrupted the proceedings of Parliament and called us thieves
 " unhone kaha, "sansad kii kaarywahi nahin chalane dena bhi loktantr kaa hissaa he
 " sushamaa kaa samarthan karte hue rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne koyala block aavanton main aniyamittaaon ko 'poonjeevaad kaa spasht udhaaharan' bataaya
 Other opposition parties also created a ruckus in Parliament over different issues
 in muddon main koyala block aavanton ghotaale main dravid munetra kadgam (diemke) ke ek mantri kii sanliptata kaa mudda bhi tha
 When the Lok Sabha resumed at 12 noon after the adjournment of the morning, some documents listed for the day's proceedings were laid on the Table of the House, and then the Speaker of the House adjourned the House indefinitely
 rajyasabha main satr ke antim din do baar kaarywahi sthagit hui
 And then he was postponed indefinitely
 pehla sthagan subah 11 baje baithak shuru hone ke tatkaal baad hua
 BJP members once again stood up from their seats and demanded the Prime Minister's resignation for the scam in coal block allocation
 samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke sadasyon ne bhi sarkari naukariyon main anusuchit jatiyon va janajatiyon ko pronnati main aarakshan dene ke liye samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak ke virodh main hangaamaa kiya or ve sabhapati ke asana ke paas pahunch gaye
 The proceedings of the Rajya Sabha were held for the first time till noon and thereafter at 12 noon
 45 baje tak ke liye sthagit hui
 When the House meets 12
 45 baje phir shuru hui to sabhapati hamid ansaari ne kaarywahi anischitkaal ke liye sthagit kar di
 The comments ansaari ne sadasyon ko suchit kiya ki puure satr main soochibaddh 399 main se maatr 11 prashn maukhik puche gaye
 During the entire session, Question Hour could be held for only one day
 ansaari ne kaha, "vyavadhaanon ke kaaran kul 62 ghante barbaad ho gaye
 " sabhapati ne niyamit prakriya ke hisse ke rup main sadasyon ke shishtachar ke liye unhen dhanyavad diya
 On this, there was a loud cry in the house
 sansad kaa monsoon satr aath agast ko shuru hua tha
 Speaking to reporters outside Parliament, Manmohan Singh on Friday attacked the BJP for stalling the Parliament continuously, saying, "we should be proud that we have a functioning democracy
" lekin is satr main hamane jo kuch dekha, vah puri tarah iskaa nakaaratmak pahalu he
 "he said," All right-thinking people in this country should stand up and jointly raise the voice that the parliamentary institutions should be allowed to function in accordance with the rules, which we have since the time of independence of the country
 Know
 " The monsoon session of Parliament was postponed indefinitely on Friday
 pradhanmantri ke istife kii maang kar rahi bhaajapa ne satr ke antim din kii kaarywahi bhi nahin chalane di
 Thus, the proceedings were interrupted for 13 days in this 20-day session
 bhaajapa adi rahi ki jis samay koyala block aavantit kiye gaye us samay koyala mantralay kar prabhaar pradhanmantri ke paas tha, isliye naitik jimmedaari lete hue manmohan singh istipha den
 Commenting on the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) which the BJP has made the basis of its demand, Manmohan Singh said that he highly respects the official auditor of India but his report will have to be discussed in Parliament
 unhone kaha, "ham sieji kaa ek sanstha ke taur par atyant sammaan karte hai
 We should debate their facts in the Public Accounts Committee and in Parliament
 ham hameshaa se yah ichha vyakt karte aae hai
 " bhaajapa par hamalaa jari rakhte hue pradhanmantri ne kaha, "vipaksh ne yah tarika chunaa ki sieji report ke bahaane tayshuda sansthagat kaaryon kaa laabh kisi ko na mili or isliye vah sansad ko baadhit karne par adi rahi
 " manmohan singh kaha, "yah loktantr kaa nakaaratmak paksh he
 If this belief was promoted, it would be in violation of the rules of parliamentary democracy
 " unhone kaha, "bharat ke saamne kai samasyaayein hai
 Somewhere there is the problem of increasing communal tension and elsewhere there is the problem of regional and ethnic tension
 kahin aatankwaad kii to kahin naksalwad kii samasya he
 These issues should be debated but these very important issues were not allowed to be discussed before the country
 " The Prime Minister also said that due to the recession, the whole world is facing serious economic difficulties and we are trying to not let the impact of what is happening in the outside world affect India
 unhone kaha, "sansad main in muddon par charchaa honi chahie thi ki vaishvik tanaavon se nipatane or vikaas ke liye hamaari aarthik ranneeti kya honi chahie
 " manmohan ne kaha, "sansad main inamen se kuch bhi nahin hone diya gaya
 As a result, the Parliament, which is a forum on which we have unambiguous views on people's needs and their unhappiness, has been completely paralyzed
 " It may be noted that the CAG report criticized the government for not adopting the auction process for allocation of coal blocks and stated that the Central Treasury 1
 86 lakh karod rupee (37 arab dollar) kaa nuksaan hua
 The BJP, while retaliating to the Prime Minister's attack, said that 'demonstration is also a part of democracy
 ' BJP leader Sushma Swaraj said, "I want to remind Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that when he was the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, he too obstructed Parliament's proceedings on the Tehelka issue
" yahaan tak ki taabut ghotaale main bhi unhone sansad kii kaarywahi baadhit kii thi or hamen chor kaha tha
 "he said," Not allowing Parliament to function is also part of democracy
 " Supporting Sushma, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley termed the irregularities in coal block allocation as 'a clear example of capitalism'
 anya vipakshi dalon ne bhi alag-alag muddon ko lekar sansad main hangaamaa kiya
 Among these issues was the involvement of a Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) minister in the coal block allocation scam
 subah ke sthagan ke baad loksabhaa kii baithak dopaher 12 baje jab dobaaraa shuru hui to din kii kaarywahi ke liye soochibaddh kuch dastavej sadan ke patal par rakhe gaye, or uske baad loksabhaa adhyaksh mira kumaar ne sadan kii kaarywahi anischitkaal ke liye sthagit kar di
 In the Rajya Sabha, the proceedings were adjourned twice on the last day of the session

 The first adjournment took place immediately after the meeting started at 11 am
 bhaajapa sadsy ek baar phir apni siton se khadey ho gaye or koyala block aavanton main ghotaale ke liye pradhanmantri ke istife kii maang karne lage
 Members of the Samajwadi Party (SP) also created a ruckus against the Constitution Amendment Bill to give reservation in promotions to scheduled castes and tribes in government jobs and they reached the chair of the Speaker

 ise durbhaagya hi kahenge ki desh kii rajdhani main mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh aae din bad rahe hai
 Delhi Police told the Supreme Court on Wednesday that there has been an increase of more than 70 per cent in cases of crime against women in the capital this year compared to 2012
 16 disambar 2012 ko hue dilli gangrape ke baad se mahilaon kii suraksha ke liye kai kade kadam uthaae lekin dilli police kii report ne khulaasa kiya ki pichley paanch saalon main is tarah kii ghatnaayen doguni ho gai hai
 Lessons taken from 'december 16', the cases of rape increased sharply till October 15 this year, the number of crime cases registered against women in Delhi is higher than the previous year
 pichley saal se abhi tak rape ke maamle dogune ho chuke hai
 As of 15 October 2013, 1330 rape cases have been registered, while 590 rapes were reported till 15 October last year
 yon shoshan ke maamalon main bhi vriddhirep ke alaava yon shoshan or chhedchhad ke maamle bhi yahaan lagaataar bad rahe hai

 isi yachika kii sunwaayee main dilli police ne ye data supreme court main jamaa kiya
 Looking at these figures, the bench said that crime against women has increased in the last five years across the country
 justise ji es singhvi ne kaha, 'mahilaayein chupchaap in aparaadhon ko jhel rahi hai or kuch hi maamle saamne aa pate hai
 Unfortunately, some memories are very sad

 Everyday, there are cases of sexual abuse of girls in trains and buses

 haal hi rajyasabha ke liye karnataka se dobaaraa chune gaye congress netaa jairam ramesh ne ek nayaa bayaan de daalaa
 Advocating Rahul's coronation in his own way, Jayaram said that Rahul is de-facto in the Congress, he should be de-juried ('actually Rahul is Congress President, but he should become the de facto President')
 jairam ne kaha ki akele rahul congress kii bagdor nahin sanbhaalenge, balki unki puri team tech over karegi
 Jayaram added that Rahul seems ready to reinvigorate the Congress with a new idea and vision, Rahul will return the Congress as Sonia did in 1998
 kisi kaa congress mukt bharat kaa sapana saakaar nahin hoga
 Jairam said, the reply came from the Congress, Congress spokesperson Sandeep Dixit said in a conversation with Aaj Tak on the statement of Jairam Ramesh, who is considered brave by the Congress, that this jumla of Jairam is extremely objectionable
 congress ko bure daur main bhi sonia or rahul ke netritv ne party ko sambhala he, unka ye bayaan nakaaratmak he, jabaki badlaav hameshaa positive note par hona chahie
 After all, we all believe that Rahul ji will lead the Congress in 2019, the discussion is about making him the president and change in the organization, it should be quick, but what the timing is, it knows better than us, it should be left on that
 kyon bole jayramsiyasi galiyaaron main jairam ko rahul kaa kareebi mana jaataa he
 But earlier when Jayaram had advised people over 60 years to leave the organization, his statement was initially considered as Rahul's voice and created a ruckus within the party
 iske baad khud rahul ne media se anaupchaarik baatcheet main safai di ki jairam ke kehane se kya hota he, main jo kah rahaa hum, usko maanenge yaa jairam ko
 i say clearly that there will be a mixture of youth and experience in the Congress organization, age is not a big factor
 haa yuvaaon ko thik-thaak jagah milegi
 After that, Jayaram has raised the ears of Congressmen by making a fresh statement as soon as he is elected as a Rajya Sabha member
 jairam ke karibiyon kaa maananaa he ki netaaon kii ek lambii fehrist siyaasi khauf dikhaakar rahul ko rokna chaahati he, kyonki usko team rahul main jagah nahin milane kaa dar he
 That is why senior leaders of the party should create such an atmosphere by making such statements so that Rahul and his team can quickly take command
 vahiin, jairam virdohi kehete hai ki sahi vakt par rahul ko adhyaksh bananaa hi he or unki pasand ke logon ko sanghathan main aana hi he, isliye jairam jaise netaa sirf team rahul main jagah banane ke liye or rahul ko khush karne ke liye aise bayaan de rahe hai, jaise vahi rahul ke asli hitaishi hai or unako koi laalach nahin
 If that was the case then why did Jayaram, who talked about removing those above 60 years, himself get 60 years of age and got the Rajya Sabha seat after laying all the pieces
 jairam virdohi un par loyal dein king kaa tamgaa chaspa karne main bhi gurej nahin karte
 On the whole, there has been talk of a big change in the coronation of Rahul and Congress, like Birbal's khichdi, which is not taking the name of cooking
 lekin mauka dekhakar jairam, digvijay or sandip jaise tamaam congressi diggaj bhala usamen apana apana siyaasi masala daalane kaa koi mauka nahin chook rahe

 " The Aam Aadmi Party chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal are showering 'free' in view of the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections, while the focus of the Delhi BJP is on the membership drive
 bijepi kaa makasad tha ki dilli vidhansabha chunaav se pehle zyada se zyada logon ko party se joda jaae
 However, now BJP has also started preparing for the Delhi Assembly elections
 dilli vidhansabha chunaav ke maddenjar party ne bada faisla lete hue kendriya mantri or bijepi ke varisht netaa prakaash jaavdekar ko dilli kaa chunaav prabharee niyukt kiya he
 With this, Union ministers Hardeep Singh Puri and Nityanand Rai have been made co-incharge
 aapako bataa den ki agle chah maheenon ke andar dilli main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 The term of the ruling Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi will end before February 2020
 aise main isse pehle chunaav hona prastaavit he
 Now the big question here is that finally why did the BJP choose Javadekar, Hardeep Singh Puri and Nityanand Rai for the Delhi Assembly elections? Actually BJP is away from the power of Delhi for almost 22 years, but the big victory in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections BJP is excited
 haalanki aravid kejariwal sarkaar ne jis tarah se 200 unit tak muft bijli, ditisi main mahilaon ke liye muft yatra or free vaai-faai kaa jo elaan kiya he, usase ek baar phir dilli bijepi main khalabali machi hui he
 Why made Javadekar the election in-charge of Delhi? BJP has made Prakash Javadekar the election in-charge of Delhi
 prakaash jaavdekar ek manje hue rajaneta maane jate hai
 Prior to this, BJP has appointed Prakash Javadekar as the election in-charge of Rajasthan and Karnataka, where he performed well
 rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav main jahaan ye mana ja rahaa tha ki bijepi kaa supada saaf hone ja rahaa he, lekin thik iske ulat bijepi ne acha pradarshan kiya
 Even though the BJP could not form the government in Rajasthan, the BJP performed well despite anti-incumbency
 iske baad rajasthan main loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko badi jeet mili
 Javadekar has also been the election in-charge of Karnataka
 jahaan bijepi ne jedies or congress ko bada jhatka dete hue sabase badi party banakar saamne ai
 At the same time, despite the alliance between JDS and Congress in the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP lost dust in the Lok Sabha elections
 ye jaavdekar ke kushal chunavi management kaa kamaal tha ki yahaan camel khilaa
 Hardeep Singh Puri, the big Sikh face of the BJP, has made Hardeep Singh Puri the co-incharge of the Delhi Assembly elections under a big plan
 wo bhartiya videsh seva ke adhikari rahe hai or bharat sarkaar main shahari vikaas mantri hai
 More importantly, Hardeep Singh Puri is also a big Sikh face, which can prove to be beneficial for BJP
 dilli main jahaan shahari voter inase apane aapako conect kar paaegaa, to vahiin dilli main anaadhikrut colony kaa mudda bhi inhen ke mantralay ke andar aata he
 Recently, the Kejriwal government of Delhi made a big announcement regarding the unauthorized colony
 jiske tahat dilli ke anaadhikrut colony main rahane vaale log apane gharon kii registry kara paaenge
 Regarding this, BJP has been continuously accusing the Kejriwal government that even Kejriwal is patting his back on the works of the Central Government
 anaadhikrut colony kaa mudda dilli main bada mudda he, jahaan kejariwal sarkaar kii pole kholi ja sakati he
 Nityanand Rai has long experience of the organization Nityanand Rai, who belongs to Bihar, has also been made co-incharge of Delhi Assembly Election by BJP, who comes from Yadav caste and has very long experience in the organization
 in sab baton ko dekhte hue bijepi ne nityanand raay ko dilli vidhansabha chunaav kaa sah-prabharee banaaya he
 At the same time, on the appointment of Union Minister Prakash Javadekar as the election in-charge of Delhi, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari said that Prakash Javadekar has watered the Bharatiya Janata Party very well
 jahaan kahin par bhi unki duty lagaai gai, vahaan party ko vijay mili
 He said that Javadekar, Hardeep Singh Puri and Nityanand Rai would be welcomed soon
 dilli main chunaav ke liye bijepi puri tarah se taiyaar he
 Big b has demanded the punishment of Delhi gang rape convicts as soon as possible
 thane main ek kaarykram main pahunche amitabh bachchan ne kaha he ki dilli main jo ghatana hui kaaphi ghrunit he
 According to Amitabh, women are highly respected in India, in such a situation, the incident in Delhi forces us to be ashamed
 aisi ghatnaon ko rokane ke liye sabhi ko jaagnaa hoga, chaahe wo netaa hon, police hon yaa prashasan

 samaajawaadee party ne basapa ke saath apane gathbandhan kaa elaan kar diya he
 SP president Akhilesh Yadav and BSP supremo Mayawati are going to press conference on Saturday
 yah press conference vahiin hone ja rahi he jahaan 2 saal pehle sapa or congress ne vidhansabha chunaav ke liye gathbandhan kaa elaan kiya tha
 It was dated 29 January 2017
 aaj 12 janvari 2019
 Hotel Taj in Lucknow will once again witness a new alliance
 vakt bhi takreeban vahi hoga, jagah bhi vahi hogi lekin gathbandhan kaa ek saathi nahin hoga
 In 2017, when Akhilesh and Rahul Gandhi held a joint press conference, both of them also wore the same color Sadri
 tab kaha gaya tha ki 'upi ke ladke' saath milakar upi ko badal denge
 The slogan was given 'UP likes it together'
 sapa ne congress 100 vidhansabha siten di thim lekin bijepi kii aandhi main purna bahumat se sarkaar chalaa chuki samaajawaadee party 47 siton par simat gai
 The Congress had to satisfy itself with only 7 seats
 bijepi ko prachand bahumat mila or yogi adityanath soobe ke siem bane
 Things have changed by the year 2019, the alliance of SP and Congress in the assembly did not succeed and later Mulayam Singh's statement added to it
 sapa sangrakshak mulaayam singh ne kaha ki congress se gathbandhan karnaa sapa kii bhul thi, agar sapa akele chunaav ladati to zyada phaayde main rahati
 The Congress is now facing the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 congress ko alag rakhkar basapa ke samarthan se samaajawaadee party ne 3 upachunaav gorakhpur, phulpur or kairana jeet liye hai
 It is said that the SP chief Akhilesh, who was trying to give support to the Congress, was stopped
 aisa mana gaya ki congress ne bijepi ke vot kaate or basapa ke sahyog se seat sapa kii jholii main aa gai
 At present, the Congress is out of this alliance
 rahul gandhi bhi kah chuke hai ki congress ko kam karke na aanka jaae
 After winning the three states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the Congress is upbeat and activists have also got excited
 saal 1993 main mulaayam singh or kanshiram kaa gathbandhan hua tha, babari masjid giraae jane ke baad kalyaan singh ne istipha de diya tha or phir se chunaav hone ja rahe the
 Then a slogan was uttered, 'mile Mulayam Kanshi Ram flew into the air Jai Shri Ram'
 1993 ke chunaav main mulaayam kii party ko 109 or basapa ko 67 siten mili thim
 Modi is in front in 2019 elections, his warrior Amit Shah claims that in 2014 he won 73 seats in UP, this time 74 will not win 72
 aise sapa-basapa gathbandhan modi ko kitni takkar de paaegaa yah aane vaala vakt hi batayega

 To be honest, i am 60 years old and i never thought that i would live to see this day
 ' Ukraine's new pro-europe leaders and the West have called the referendum 'illegal', as the strategically important Crimea has been virtually under control of Russian military forces since the beginning of this month
 matadaataaon ke paas ek vikalp yah tha ki vah yaa to rus ke saath jaaen yaa phir 1992 ke us samvidhan kii taraf vaapasi karen, jiske tahat kreemia ko ukraine ke tahat ek swatantra praant banaaya gaya tha
 Maintaining good relations with Ukraine was no longer an option for voters
 is bich, america ne kreemia main hue janamat sangrah ko sire se khaarij kar diya or sankat ke samay rus ke is kadam ko 'khatarnaak or asthirataa paidaa karne vaala' qaraar diya
 US White House spokesman Jay Carney said, "this referendum is against the Constitution of Ukraine and the international community will not recognize the results of these elections in the midst of Russia's military intervention, because it violated international law

 upi chunaav se sabak lete hue, gujarat me congress modi ke muqaabale sirf apane rajya ke netaaon ko saamne rakhegi, soshal media ke jariye congress prachaar karegi ki gujarat kaa mukhyamantri narendra modi yaa rahul gandhi nahi banenge
 Therefore, Vijay Rupani vs Bharat Singh, Shakti Singh, Siddharth Patel, Arjun Modhwadia and other local leaders will be contested by keeping the front
 is par sidhe bharat solanki ne kaha ki, bijepi ke rajya ke siem or baaki netaaon se janata kaa bharosa uth chukaa he, isliye modi dare hue hai
 That is why Amit Shah and Modi are coming to Gujarat again and again

 ) As soon as Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced to reduce electricity prices in the capital, the country's politics suffered a shock of 440 volts
 jor kaa jhatka kejariwal sarkaar ko samarthan dene vaali congress ko bhi laga or un bijli companiyon ko bhi, jo kejariwal ke aam aadmi ko bijli supplai karti hai
 Kejriwal's impact was seen in Mumbai as well
 ye kejariwal kaa asar hi to he ki somvaar ko mumbai kii sadakon par congress ke bade-bade netaa bhi bijli ke daam ghataane ko lekar aam aadmi ban gaye
 The protesters even called the owners of the power company a thief
 dilli main chunaav se pehle or baad main bhi ye sawaal jeevant hai ki
 
 
 - Are power companies in Delhi rigged extensively
 -kya bijli ke meter tej bhaag rahe hai
 - Are there disturbances in electricity bills as well
 -kya kejariwal sachmuch main bijli aadhe daam par denge
 - Will Kejriwal be able to bring the wrongdoers to jail
 desh kii raajnneeti main ubaal laane vaale in sawaalon ko lekar aaj tak ne pichley kuch dinon main ek bada sting oparation kiya
 On this biggest sting operation on the power politics, till date, it recorded the heart of the big officers of the power companies on the intelligence camera
 is sansanikhej sting oparation main dilli ko bijli supplai karne vaali badi-badi companiyon ke bade-bade afasaron ke bade khulaase kiye hai
 Ajay Kumar, Vice President (operations), BSES Rajdhani, says do the audit, four to five will come out in Gandhi too
 vahiin isi company ke salaahkaar aar
 C
 natarajan ke anusaar is audit se kuch nahin nikalegaa
 It is true that when Arvind Kejriwal tried to change the politics of the country and started adding common man's meters from house to house on the streets of Delhi, at that time it was decided that if Kejriwal's government was formed then the first shock was 440 volts
 Will feel like bijli kii siyasat par aaj tak ke sting oparation ‘oparation 440 volt’ main dilli main kejariwal kii sarkaar ko sahaara de rahe congress netaa arvinder singh lavali bhi hai
 Lovely has the power to topple Kejriwal's government with one stroke
 lavali kii vajah se hi arvind mukhyamantri hai
 Due to Lovely, the common man is getting electricity at half the price
 lavali hi nahin, congress ke ek or kaddavar netaa or dilli ke purv bijli mantri haaron usoof bhi khufia camere main bolte hue dikhe hai
 Arvinder Singh Lovely, who supported Kejriwal with both hands in the assembly, may be kind to the top, but politics is going on inside his mind
 kejariwal ne jab aam aadmi ko lubhaane ke liye bijli ke daam aadhe karne kaa elaan kiya to shaayad bheetar se lavali ko 440 volt kaa jhatka laga hoga
 Lovely, who runs Kejriwal's government, said that even the Congress wanted to give subsidy to the common man, but there was no money in the coffers of the Delhi government
 unhone kaha ki paise nahin hai to phir kejariwal kahaan se paisa lekar aaenge
 No session has been held inside the assembly yet
 ab ye kah rahe hai ham edjastment kar denge
 If they do, it is completely illegal
 isamen adhikariyon kii jimmedaari tay ho jaaegi
 Arvinder Singh Lovely, the veteran Congress leader, opened on the intelligence camera
 ve yahaan tak kah gaye ki aam aadmi ke liye jis skim kaa unhone elaan kiya he, wo yaa to sarkari hisaab-kitaab kii gadbady he yaa phir kejariwal jhooth bol rahe hai
 He accused Kejriwal of lying in the case of electricity
 lavali ab puri tarah se khulkar bol rahe the or bolte hi bolte unhone ye bhi khulaasa kiya ki kejariwal par bhrashtachar kaa mukadmaa bhi darj ho saktaa he
 We are not expecting that they will fix this in a month
 ham inhen acha time dena chaahate hai
 Lovely said to put the PIL against Kejriwal in the power mess
 dilli main arvind kejariwal kii sarkaar congress ke samarthan se chal rahi he
 But after aap's stern stance on the mess of the electricity bill, the question is what the Congress will do
 aaj tak ke sting oparation 440 volt main congress netaa arvind singh lavali ne daawa kiya ki companiyon ke audit kaa aadesh to unki sarkaar ne hi diya tha
 And yes, if Kejriwal feels that there is a disturbance, then get a CBI inquiry
 sadan ke bheetar arvind kejariwal kii sarkaar ko samarthan or sadan ke baahar arvind kejariwal par mukademe kii baat
 Somewhere the growing popularity of the common man and the increasing domination of AAP in Delhi is troubling Delhi Pradesh Congress President Arvinder Singh Lovely
 aadhe daam par bijli ke maamle main jab hamane lavali se poocha ki bijli companiyaan gadabad kar rahi hai or bahut se gharon main jo meter lag rahe hai wo tej chal rahe hai, to lavali ne tapaak se jawaab diya ki meter kaa maamla unki hi sarkaar ne uthaaya tha
 Aaj Tak: i want to understand one more thing that i have read in a statement the order to check the meter which runs fast
 
 
 aap disi offis main jaakar compline kar sakate hai
 Lovely: Our government has placed an order
 pehle bhi yahi he or ab bhi
 But this is media
 aap logon ko fursat nahin hamaare order ko dikhaane kii
 You have time to show its (kejriwal's) order
 sirf itnaa fark he
 And there is no difference
 sieji audit kisne order kiya tha
 
 
 Our government did
 haaron ji power ministar the government main hamaari, unhone kiya
 You were not showing his news at that time
 ab dikhaa rahe hai
 It is clear that both the Congress leaders, Lovely and Aaron Yusuf, were upset with the growing popularity of Aam Aadmi Party and Kejriwal
 tabhi hamane lavali se poocha ki aam aadmi party un par bijli maamle main sibiai kii jaanch kara sakati he
 Aaj Tak: One more question, Sir
 
 
 chijen aapako yahaan se kahaan jaati hui najar aa rahi hai
 CAG audit is the excuse you think
 sarkaar ke sutron se jaankaree mil rahi he ki shaayad ye aap logon ke peeche yaa aap logon ko sibiai inquayri ke daayre main laane kii baat kar rahe hai
 If there is a disturbance in the CAG audit, then people who believe that it may be a mistake
 
 
 or sibiai se isaki jaanch karai jaay
 
 
 Lovely
 
 
 bilkul jaanch karai jaae
 
 
 What do you think we are directors in the company? 
 
 lavali sibiai kii baat sunakar jhunjhala gaye the or shaayad isiilie unka kehane kaa matlab tha ki wo kya bijli company ke diarector he jo unhen fansaa diya jayega
 Just listen once again to Lovely's answer
 lavalihkaren
 
 
 Exactly be investigated
 
 
 matlab aapako kya lag rahaa he ki (bijli) company main ham diarector hai kya
 
 
 Tell me one thing that it is an RTI activist
 aapako kya lagata he ki itane time se inhone (kejariwal ne) RTI main government kii koi file mangai nahin hogi, jo file aaj dekh rahe hai
 
 
 He has also seen in the RTI, who will see the file as the Chief Minister
 ab to right to information kaa jamaana he
 
 
 They must have seen that file in the RTI too
 ajatkajo government ke sutron kaa maananaa he ki sibiai main bhi jane kii taiyaari he
 
 
 Lovely: Go
 
 Who has refused 
 
 We will welcome that enquiry
 
 
 He wrote everything in the letter he wrote
 inquayri vaali baat hamane wo agree karke hi samarthan diya he
 
 
 Therefore, it is supported that milk should be made of milk and water of water
 'chahen to sibiai jaanch kara len mukhyamantri'lavali khulkar bol rahe the, to hamane sochaa ki lavali ke saath hi kyon nahin dilli vidhansabha main congress ke netaa or purv bijli mantri haaron usoof ke dil kaa bhi haal jaan liya jaae
 Aaj Tak: What does your bureaucracy tell (about the government)
 
 
 haaron usufdab beuroperesi kii kya baat karen
 
 
 Now those who are facing it are facing it
 
 
 But we could see them what they are passing to
 
 
 But the question is that everything should be said and retracted
 
 
 abhi (kejariwal) koi baat kah rahe hai or agle minute use change kar rahe hai
 
 
 'kejriwal changes again with his words' Haroon Yusuf, who was the Minister of Power in the Congress Government, says that the way Arvind Kejriwal works is not right
 mantri wo kaam kar rahe hai jo mantri kaa kaam nahin he
 Aaj Tak: Saar, power subsidiaries
 
 
 They are selling power on cheap rate
 
 
 What is this issue? 
 
 aap ne isapar inquayri order kiye the
 
 
 Aaron Yusuf: Minister does not go into these details
 
 
 
 it is power department
 
 they have senior officers
 
 
 it DERC which checks ki power kahaan bech rahe hai
 
 
 Where else are you buying from
 
 
 The job of DERC
 
 
 Its not the job of ministers
 
 
 when they submit their ARR
 
 annual revenue requirement
 
 
 Do their summits
 
 
 it is the duty of DERC to go into the details ki power kharidi kitne main or bechi kitne main
 
 
 That is not a concern of the government
 
 
 DERC banaai kyon he
 
 isse saaf he ki kejariwal sarkaar ko samarthan to congress de rahi he lekin bijli kaa jhatka companiyon ke saath saath congress ko bhi lag rahaa he
 What do the officials say on the audit? Even the big officials of power distribution companies in Delhi have revealed our sting operation in 440 volts
 aam aadmi ke gharon par aadhe daam par bijli dene ke vaayade ne congress ke saath saath bijli companiyon ko bhi 440 volt kaa jhatka de diya he
 You read everything that Delhi Pradesh Congress President Arvinder Singh Lovely and Aaron Yusuf, who were the power ministers in the Sheila government, said
 ab ham aapako bataate hai ki bijli companiyon ke afasaron kaa kya kahana he
 bses-rajdhani Vice President Ajay Kumar, when told that his company is going to be audited, was provoked in the name of the audit itself
 ajay kumaar kaa kahana tha ki kejariwal sarkaar kii karrwai kaa koi matlab nahin he
 RC Natarajan, an advisor to bses-rajdhani, was also angry with allegations of corruption against power companies
 tata kii tipididiel company bhi dilli main bijli supplai karti he
 The CEO of the company says that they welcome the audit
 udhar dilli ke purv power secretary shakti sinha kaa maananaa he ki bijli supplai main dhaandhlee hui he or kejariwal kaa faisla sahi he
 Now whether the price of electricity will be half or not and even if it will happen, it is not known but if the Congress believes, then if the condition of the government's coffers is crisp, then these promises are only half incomplete

 Earlier, three petitions were filed before the Election Commission alleging that the Mayawati government has deliberately installed elephant statues on several monuments in the state
 basapa ne apane tark main kaha ki agar uske hathi chunaav chinh par aapatti kii ja rahi he tab to us aadhaar par ek rashtriya party hone ke naate bhaajapa ko bhi apane raajnneetik chinh ke rup main camel kaa istemaal karne kii ijaajat nahin di ja sakati kyonki yah sidhe use dharmik puranic gaatha se jodta he or sthaayee aadhaar par matadaataaon ke dilo dimag ko prabhavit karata he
 In its reply, the party also took a dig at the Congress and said that with the election symbol, the leaders of the party shake hands and greet everyone

 Mishra alleged that the petition was not in the public interest and was motivated by political parties who felt insecure with the bsp's growing stature
 unhone chunaav ayog se maang kii ki in yachikaaon ko radd kar diya janaa chahie
 He said the Election Commission listened to the party's arguments and gave all the parties involved in the matter two weeks to file their replies

 Regarding the installation of the statue of BSP chief and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati, the party said that statues of late Prime Ministers like Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi have been installed at many places

 neshnal security guard (NSG) ke diarector general jayant choudhary ne chetaya he ki aatanki sanghathan al kaayda or iesas desh ke kai shaharon main hamalaa karne kaa saajha plan bana rahe hai
 Plan to show Modi an enemy of Islam! Talking to reporters on the sidelines of a program of the NSG, Jayant Chaudhary said, "now that Al Qaeda has expressed its intention of a terrorist attack in India
 aise main vah anya aatanki sanghathan jaise lashkar e taiyaba, iesas or indian mujahidin kii madad bhi le sakate he
 If he performs such an operation, then we should be prepared for the same time terror attack in many cities
 ' unhone kaha ki in sanghathanon ke nishane par goa, bengalooru or amritsar jaise tourist hub hai
 Chaudhary said, "terrorism has become even more dangerous today
 mumbai main 26 / 11 to bas ek shuruyaat thi
 However, he also said that the NSG is fully prepared for such attacks
 jab bhi jarurat padi, ham uchit karrwai karenge
 This warning from the NSG DG came a day after the intelligence agency alerted that Al Qaeda wants to carry out its abominable intent in the festive season
 khufia agenciyon ke mutabik al kaayda ne bharat ke kai shaharon main aatanki hamale karne ke liye pratibandhit sanghathan simi (SIMI) se haath milaayaa he

 The scheme is likely to be implemented in colleges and polytechnics under All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE)
 eisitii is yojana ke liye disha nirdesh lekar ai he or kai sansthaanon ne iske liye aavedan bhi kiya he
 a national level committee headed by VS Oberoi, Secretary of Higher Education in the Ministry of Human Resource Development will oversee the implementation of the scheme
 iske alaava rajya samitiyaan bhi hongi
 AICTE has brought guidelines for this scheme and many institutes have also applied for it

 Due to the injury of these raids, the political equations of the state are also changing
 khud lalu prasad yadav ne twit ke jariye in atakalon par jaise muhar laga di he
 However, Lalu later clarified his first tweet, and turned the matter to the media and government agencies
 inakam tex ke chhaapon se ghir gaye lalu yadavainakam tex vibhaag ne mangalvaar subahalalu prasad yadavake 22 thikaanon par chhapemari kii
 These raids have been killed in the case of benami property
 in chhaapon ke baad lalu yadav ne twit kiya ki bijepi ko nayaa gathbandhan sahyogi mubarak ho
 Lalu Prasad is not one to bow down and be afraid
 jabatak aakhri saans he fasivadi takaton ke kilaaf ladata rahoonga
 Regarding Lalu's tweet, it is believed that he is not telling anyone else but his ally Janata Dal United in the state as bjp's new ally
 aisa isliye kyonki pichley kuch dinon se argedy or jediu ke bich matbhed gahraate ja rahe hai
 Happy new alliance partners to BJP
 lalu prasad jhukne or darane vaala nahin he
 Till the last breath, i will keep fighting against the fascist forces
 — Lalu Prasad Yadav (@laluprasadrjd)may 16, 2017susheel modi ne diya tha samarthan kaa isharabihar bijepi ke adhyaksh susheel modi pichley kuch dinon se lalu yadav or unke parivaar ko karpshan ke aaropon main gherte ja rahe hai
 It started with the soil scandal in which questions were raised on Lalu's family
 uske baad misa bharti kii dilli membenami sampattiko nishaanaa banaaya gaya or aaj iskar ke chaape bhi pad gaye
 The special thing is that while Sushil Modi is an attacker on Lalu Yadav, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his party JDU are spared from this
 yahaan tak ki susheel modi ne kuch din pehle saaf-saaf kaha tha ki agar nitish lalu yadav se alag hoti he to bijepi unhen samarthan dene par vichaar kar sakati he
 Nitish Kumar made a big statement regarding the post of PM Nitish Kumar yesterday, while dismissing the speculation being made about his ambitions for the Prime Minister's post, said that he is not a fool and he has no ambition to become PM candidate
 nitish ke is bayaan ko ek tarah se endie main unki entry kii taiyaari ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he kyonki vipaksh or media kaa ek tabaka aksar 2019 ke aam chunaavon main modi ke saamne nitish ke khadey hone kii bhavishyavaanee karata rahaa he
 What it says: Bihar's equation needs 122 mlas for a majority in the 243-member Bihar Assembly
 is samay jediu ke 71, argedy ke 80 jabaki congress ke 27 vidhayakon valimhagathbandhansarkaar chal rahi he
 If Nitish breaks away from RJD and goes to NDA, then 27 Congress mlas will also withdraw from the government
 aise main nitish ko sarkaar bachaane ke liye 51 or vidhayakon kii jarurat hogi
 BJP has 53 mlas in the assembly
 iske alaava algepi ke 2, araspi ke 2, echeem ke 1, sipiai emel librasion ke teen or swatantra 4 vidhayak hai
 That is, JDU and BJP can form a government together as the total number of mlas of both parties is 124
 nitish ko nahin he bijepi se koi allerginithish kumaar bijepi ke saath milakar sarkaar chalaa chuke hai
 He was also the railway minister during the Vajpayee government
 yani nitish ko vichaardhaara ke str par bijepi se koi pareshaani nahin he
 His alliance with the BJP was broken due to his personal feud with Narendra Modi in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and he had to form a grand alliance in the assembly elections but Nitish was never as comfortable with Lalu
 duusari ore narendra modi se unke rishte pichley do saal main kaaphi sudhare hai
 In such a situation, once NDA government is formed under Nitish's leadership in Bihar, it will not be surprising

 Yuvraj Singh, the senior batsman of the Indian middle order, believes that if you can't win the match, then it doesn't matter how strong you are on paper
 baayen haath ke is ballebaaj ne iske alaava 1983 kii vishwa champion team ke saath tulana karne se inkaar kar diya
 Yuvraj said, our team is winning the match right now and it is important

 It doesn't matter how strong the team is on paper

 When Yuvraj was asked about his responsibilities in the team, he said, it is important to bat well in the middle overs and see the situation
 ham kisi sthiti main hai
 We need to shape the innings or have a big partnership
 pichley do saal se main yahi karne kii koshish kar rahaa hum
 Bitter memories of the World Cup played in the West Indies four years ago are still fresh in Yuvraj's mind and he believes that a good start will be important for the team
 unhone kaha, hamane nishchit taur par westeindies main 2007 main khele gaye vishwa cap or kwalifai nahin kar paane ke kaarnon par vichaar kiya
 It has passed and we are making a new beginning
 pichley vishwa cap main ham lay hasil nahin kar paae
 This time it will be important to achieve the rhythm
 hamen acchhee taiyaari kerani hogi or dekhte hai ki toornament kii shuruyaat kisi rahati he
 The left-handed batsman, however, declined to comment on the format, while tournament director Ratnakar Shetty admitted it had been adapted to India
 yuvaraj ne kaha, mujhe praaroop se koi dikkat nahin he
 Whatever the format, my job is to play
 ab tak 265 vanade khilne vaale yuvaraj kaa maananaa he ki ballebaaji powerple ko lekar ravaiya kaaphi mahatvapurn hoga
 He said, then you have to depend on the circumstances
 kabhi yah aapke anukool ho saktaa he or kisi paristhiti main yah nuksaandaayak ho saktaa he
 It will be important what time you take the powerplay
 aam taur par aap tab powerple lete hai, jabaki ballebaaj jame hote hai or yadi aap nahin lete ho to phir 45 over to ise lenaa hi padegaa
 Yuvraj also said that even though he is bowling constantly these days, he does not consider himself an expert bowler
 unhone kaha, main khud ko visheshgy gendbaaj nahin maanata
 Whenever i am handed a ball, i enjoy my bowling
 jis din maine yah sochna shuru kar diya ki main visheshgy gendbaaj hum, ballebaaj meri dhunaai karnaa shuru kar denge
 He said, i do not consider myself a bowler
 pichley 50 vanade main maine isliye adhik gendbaaji kii, kyonki hamaare paas baayen haath kaa visheshgy spinner nahin he
 So my job is to do seven-eight overs

 This condition is called atrial fibrillation
 yah stroke va heart felyor ko badhaane kaa kaam karata he
 Research has shown that compared to those who work 35 to 40 hours a week, atrial fibrillation is about 40% more likely to occur in those who work 55 hours
 tippaniyan Professor Mika Kivimaki of University College London said that an additional 40 per cent increase in risk is a serious risk for people who are not already exposed to other factors such as older age, men, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, smoking and physical activity
 There is a high risk of heart diseases or those who are already suffering from heart diseases
 kivimaaki ne kaha ki yah un prakriyaaon main se ek ho saktaa he jise pehle ke adhyayanon main lambey samay tak kaam karne waalon main stroke ke khatre kii sambhaavna bataai gai he

 25 oktober ko indonesia main anderworld don chota rajan ke pakade jane ke baad hi use bharat deport karne kii kavayad shuru kar di gai thi
 Immediately, even though it is believed that the man who is traveling on a fake passport in the name of Mohan Kumar is the fugitive Chhota Rajan of India
 lekin use bharat deport karne ke liye thos saboot kii darkaar thi
 Chhota Rajan is from Mumbai and most cases against him are also registered in Mumbai, so the CBI, the nodal agency of Interpol in India, asked the Mumbai Police to provide concrete evidence
 mumbai police ne bhi thanon main dhul phaankati filon main rajan ke aparaadhon kii talash shuru kar di
 The list of about 70 crimes was prepared immediately
 21 april 1973 ko jari rajendra nikhalje naam kii uski skool living certificate mili, uskaa matdaan card bhi mil gaya
 But no such evidence was found to prove that the man caught in Indonesia and the fugitive Rajan of India are the same person
 ab rajan ke haath kii ungaliyon ke nishaan kii talash shuru hui
 But most of the cases registered against Rajan were after he left the country
 isliye usamen ungaliyon ke nishaan nahin the
 Rajan was a resident of Tilak Nagar in Chembur and he also took the first step in the world of crime
 puraane afasaron se pataa chalaa ki 35 saal pehle yani mumbai se bhaagane ke pehle 1980 main rajan ke khilaaf hatya kaa maamla darj hua tha or wo usamen giraftaar bhi hua tha
 Meaning his fingerprints were taken
 tippaniyan What was it then, under the leadership of the woman police inspector Manisha Shirke of Tilak Nagar, 6 policemen were given the task of searching for that file
 kadi mashkkat ke baad wo fil to mili lekin usame rakhe dastavej fat chuke the
 There were also 3 pieces of paper with markings on the hands
 teenon tukdon ko jodakar use scan kiya gaya tab jaakar rajan kii ungaliyon ke nishaan mil paye
 On the same trail, India was able to prove that the person caught is the fugitive little Rajan of India and he is a citizen of India
 jaankaron ke mutabik agar chota rajan ke 35 saal puraane finger prints nahin milte to rajan kii pahchaan ke liye uskaa diene test karana padataa
 Rajan's brother and sister also had to undergo a DNA test to match him
 jisame kai din guzar jate
 Chhota Rajan is from Mumbai and most cases against him are also registered in Mumbai, so the CBI, the nodal agency of Interpol in India, asked the Mumbai Police to provide concrete evidence
 mumbai police ne bhi thanon main dhul phaankati filon main rajan ke aparaadhon kii talash shuru kar di
 The list of about 70 crimes was prepared immediately
 21 april 1973 ko jari rajendra nikhalje naam kii uski skool living certificate mili, uskaa matdaan card bhi mil gaya
 But no such evidence was found to prove that the man caught in Indonesia and the fugitive Rajan of India are the same person
 ab rajan ke haath kii ungaliyon ke nishaan kii talash shuru hui
 But most of the cases registered against Rajan were after he left the country
 isliye usamen ungaliyon ke nishaan nahin the
 Rajan was a resident of Tilak Nagar in Chembur and he also took the first step in the world of crime
 puraane afasaron se pataa chalaa ki 35 saal pehle yani mumbai se bhaagane ke pehle 1980 main rajan ke khilaaf hatya kaa maamla darj hua tha or wo usamen giraftaar bhi hua tha
 Meaning his fingerprints were taken
 tippaniyan What was it then, under the leadership of the woman police inspector Manisha Shirke of Tilak Nagar, 6 policemen were given the task of searching for that file
 kadi mashkkat ke baad wo fil to mili lekin usame rakhe dastavej fat chuke the
 There were also 3 pieces of paper with markings on the hands
 teenon tukdon ko jodakar use scan kiya gaya tab jaakar rajan kii ungaliyon ke nishaan mil paye
 On the same trail, India was able to prove that the person caught is the fugitive little Rajan of India and he is a citizen of India
 jaankaron ke mutabik agar chota rajan ke 35 saal puraane finger prints nahin milte to rajan kii pahchaan ke liye uskaa diene test karana padataa
 Rajan's brother and sister also had to undergo a DNA test to match him
 jisame kai din guzar jate
 Now the search for fingerprints on Rajan's hand started
 par rajan ke khilaaf darj zyaadaatar maamle uske desh chhodane ke baad ke the
 So there were no fingerprints in it
 rajan chembur ke tilak nagar kaa rahane vaala tha or aparaadh kii duniya main pehla kadam bhi usne vahiin rakhaa tha
 It was learned from the old officers that a murder case was registered against Rajan in 1980 and 35 years before he escaped from Mumbai and he was also arrested in it
 matlab uski ungaliyon ke nishaan liye gaye the
 The comments bas phir kya tha, tilak nagar kii mahila police nireekshak manisha shirake ke netritv main 6 pulisavaalon ko us fil kii talash kaa kaam diya gaya
 After hard work, that file was found but the documents kept in it were torn
 haath ke panjon ke nishaan vaale kaagaj ke bhi 3 tukade ho chuke the
 After adding all the three pieces, he was scanned and then got Rajan's fingerprints
 usee nishaan ke bal par bharat ye sabit kar paaya ki pakadaa gaya shaks bharat kaa bhagoda chota rajan he or wo bharat kaa hi naagarik he
 According to experts, if Chhota Rajan's 35-year-old finger prints were not found, then he would have to undergo a DNA test to identify Rajan
 uske milan ke liye rajan ke bhai or bahan kaa bhi diene test karana padataa
 In which many days would pass

 Crores of rupees are being spent all over the city by putting up posters and hoardings filled with claims of curbing corruption and catching the corrupt, but the condition of ACB catching the corrupt is such that it is looking forward to stand on its own feet
 sutron ke mutabik, asibi ke paas abhi kul 110 karmchaaree hai, jabaki isamen jarurat 239 logon kii he
 There are a total of 7 vehicles in ACB office, out of which 5 are in bad condition, hence 25 vehicles have been sought from the Delhi government
 sutron kii maane to dilli sarkaar ne asibi kii sabhi maangon ko manjuuri de di he
 Special allowance of ACB employees has also been increased by 35 per cent
 helpline 1031 par ab tak sava lakh se zyada colls aa chuki hai, jinamein se 252 asibi kii karrwai ke liye sahi pai gayi
 In the last 100 days, ACB has registered 14 cases related to corruption and arrested 38 people
 tippaniyan Most of those arrested belonged to Jal Board, Education Department and Agro Market Board, two cases were also registered against Delhi Police and one arrest was made
 asibi kii karrwai par 165 logon ko suspend kiya gaya
 In the previous 49-day government of Kejriwal, 18 cases were registered and 15 people were arrested

 According to the Central Government's notification, the ACB of Delhi Government cannot take action against any employee of the department under the Central Government
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki kaamanwealth, jal board, transport, sienji ghotaalon jaise bade cese ab tak kisi anjaam tak nahin pahunche hai
 The Delhi government claims that they have reduced corruption in Delhi by 60 to 70 percent
 haalanki hakeekat isse bilkul alag he
 If sources are to be believed, the Delhi government has approved all ACB demands
 asibi ke karmchaariyon kaa vishesh bhatta bhi 35 fisadi badha diya gaya he
 So far more than 1
25 lakh calls have been received on helpline 1031, out of which 252 were found to be correct for ACB action
 pichley 100 dinon main asibi ne bhrashtachar se jude 14 cese darj kiye or 38 logon ko giraftaar kiya
 The comments giraftaar logon main zyaadaatar jal board, shiksha vibhaag or agro market board ke hai, dilli police ke khilaaf bhi do maamle darj hue or ek giraftaar hui
 165 people were suspended on ACB action
 kejariwal kii pichhali 49 din kii sarkaar main 18 cese darj hue the or 15 log giraftaar kiye gaye
 While 48 cases were registered in one year during President's rule, only 24 people were arrested

 centre sarkaar ke notification ke mutabik, dilli sarkaar kii asibi centre sarkaar ke adheen mahakamon ke kisi bhi karmchaaree ke khilaaf karrwai nahin kar sakati

 Recently she was seen in a pink bikini
 unhen dekhakar is baat kaa khulaasa ho gaya ki vah garbhvatee nahin hai
 According to the website radaronline
com, Aniston is currently vacationing in Mexico with his fiancé Justin Theroux
 unhen yahaan hotel cabana main dekha gaya tha
 Earlier it was being said that Aniston, 43, is wearing big jackets and other clothes to hide her pregnancy
 ateet kabhi peechha nahin chodta
 Syed Liaquat Shah started a 1,000 km long journey from Muzaffarabad in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (pok) with the hope that it would eventually reach his village in Kupwara, Jammu and Kashmir
 20 march kii shaam abhi gaharaai hi thi ki hijbul mujahidin kaa yah purv aatanki apni bivi akhtarun nisa or sauteli beti jabina ke saath bharat-nepal seemaa kii sonauli check post par pahunchaa
 The 45-year-old Shah was relieved of the life of a fugitive
 samarpan kar apane gaanv lautne ke alaava uski koi tamanna nahin thi
 But what he knew was that the return home was a far-fetched pleasure for him
 bharat kii seemaa main pravesh karne ke kuch hi der baad vahaan intjaar kar rahi dilli police ke special cell kii team ne use giraftaar kar liya
 The police then released an official statement claiming that they had thwarted a major terrorist attack in Delhi
 police ne shah ko hijbul kaa kukhyat aatankwaadi bataaya or kaha ki uski holi ke aasapaas silsilewar fidaayin hamale kii sajeesh thi
 Police also claimed that an AK-56 rifle and three grenades were recovered in a raid on Haji Arafat Guest House in Delhi's Jama Masjid area on the basis of information received from Shah's interrogation
 sansad par hamale ke doshi mohammad afjal guru ko 9 farvari ko faansee par chadhaane ke kaaran centre or jammu-kashmir kii sarkaron ke bich paidaa hue tanaav ko shah kii giraftaar ne or badha diya he
 Chief Minister Omar Abdullah admits that the Delhi Police has fabricated this whole story and he also satirizes, "I am hearing for the first time that a terrorist who came to attack had his wife's hand in one hand and arms in the other, As if he is going for a picnic
 ”unhone jor dekar kaha ki kendriya grih mantralay kii manjuuri se sudharne ko icchhuk aatankiyon ke liye punarvaas yojana chalaai ja rahi he or shah ne usee yojana ke tahat maafee maangi thi
 They also warn that terrorists who wish to lay down their arms may change their mind by being suspicious of Shah's arrest
 aatankwaadiyon ke liye yah punarvaas yojana november 2010 se chalaai ja rahi he or tab se 300 se zyada aise aatankwaadi waapas ghar laut chuke hai, jo seemaa paar kar pioke main bhaag gaye the
 In return, they neither get a guarantee of return of pending criminal cases nor any monetary compensation
 kupwada kii khubasurat lolab ghati main cheri ke bagichon se ghire gaanv dardpora ke jane-maane sufi moulana ke bete shah ne 1995 main jab pehali baar niyantran rekha paar kii tab vah mahaj 27 saal kaa tha
 The Jammu and Kashmir Police also believe that Shah was associated with Hizbul and had also trained in a terrorist camp at pok but was never accused of being involved in any terrorist incident
 sunne main aayaa he ki shah 1996 main laut aayaa tha, lekin ek saal baad jab police ko is baat kii bhanak lagi to waapas pioke bhaag gaya
 Her first wife Amina Shah had submitted her surrender application to the Kupwara police in 2011, but refused to return to Jammu and Kashmir with Shah
 shah kaa pakistan se tab mohabhang ho gaya jab use uske haal par chhod diya gaya or vah aajeevika chalaane ke liye mujaffarabad main chote-mote kaam karne ko majaboor ho gaya
 To make life a little easier away from home, Shah married a 10-year-old Beva Naseema Bibi, shortly after moving to pok in 1997
 2006 main usne hijbul ke ek aatankwaadi hasan gilaani kii bevaa akhtarun nisa se teesri shaadi kii
 Hassan was killed in 1995 by the Indian Army
 shah kii yah bivi apni beti ke saath bhartiya passport par mujaffarabad gayi
 Seven years later, Akhtarun Nisa persuaded his husband Shah that he should take advantage of the Indian government's amnesty scheme
 haalanki punarvaas niti ke tahat aadhikarik taur par poonch-rawalakot, udi-mujaffarabad, wagha or dilli ke indira gandhi antarrashtriya hawaondde ko hi pravesh kaa rasta mana gaya he, lekin 2011 se waapas laute 300 se adhik aatankwaadiyon main se kai ne safaltaapurvak aajamaae jate rahe nepal maarg ko apanaaya
 Shah and his family also chose this route
 ab crolpora (kupwada) main apane pita ke ghar rah raheen akhtarun nisa un halaat ko bayaan karti hai ki shah ne kaise pioke kii rajdhani mujaffarabad main chiken shop chalaakar badi mushkil se kharide gaye jameen ke tukade ko bechakar bharat lautne ke kharche kaa bandobast kiya tha
 She says, “the two lakh Pakistani rupees that we had added were spent on making documents for the pie-pie journey and on air tickets
 ”kashmir ghati main shanti bahaali ke lihaaj se jaruri muddon ko to chhod hi den, pichhali do garmiyon se vahaan kaa maahaul jo bhi thodaa-bahut sudharta dikh rahaa he, use banaae rakhane main bhi centre sarkaar kii ore se dikhaai gai udaseenta ne mukhyamantri umr ko rajya se jude adhiktar muddon par sakht rukh akhriyaar karne par majaboor kar diya he
 On 25 March, while addressing the Legislative Assembly in Jammu, Omar blatantly accused the Government of India of favoring the Kashmiris
 unhone afjal guru ko ‘aanan-fanan’ di gai faansee par sawaal uthaae
 At the same time, it also expressed displeasure over the central government's stand on the issue of the removal of the Armed Forces Privilege Act (AFSPA)
 eexspie kashmir se bhi zyada hinsa vaale naksal prabhavit kshetron main bhi lagu nahin he
 He said, "you have a different scale for Jammu and Kashmir
 
 
 kashmir main to koi helicopter nahin giraaya gaya
 He also referred to the fall of MI-17 helicopter of the Indian Air Force by the Naxalites in Chhattisgarh on 18 January
 is yuva or naaraaz mukhyamantri ko apratyaashit taur par apane rajnatik pratidwandviyon kaa bhi saath miltaa he
 Mehbooba Mufti, the head of the People's Democratic Party (PPP), says, "kashmiris are arrested without any evidence
" unhen puraskaar or medal ke liye chaare kii tarah istemaal kiya jaataa he
 "by the way, except for a radical separatist like Syed Ali Shah Geelani, the relatively moderate Mirwaiz Umar Farooq has not reacted to the case so far
 ek varisht police adhikari kehete hai, ‘‘liyakat kii giraftaar se ve to kaaphi khush honge
 Any success of the government's rehabilitation policy, which was launched to mainstream the Kashmiris who had taken up arms, would wash away the plans of separatists in the valley
 ”haalanki dilli police kii special cell ke jaanchakartaaon ne jor dekar kaha ki shah kaa lautnaa sunahari yaadon ke saath ghar vaapasi kii daastaan nahin jaisaa ki mukhyamantri umr abdulla, jammu-kashmir police or is purv aatankwaadi ke gharavaale prachaarit kar rahe hai
 a Special Cell official said, "of course he was involved
 yahi vah vyakti tha jisase mili jaankaree ke aadhaar par jama masajid ilaake se hathiyaar baraamad hue
 Talking to India Today, he said that if the intention of the Delhi Police had been to prepare a strong case only against him, he would have been shown to have got a weapon with him in Sonauli

 Shah Rukh Khan, who was IPL champion in 2012 and 2014, has not made much changes in the team

 Kolkata gave Colin Munro 30 lakhs, Jason Holder 7 lakhs and John Hastings 1
 3 karod main kharida he
 For the past few seasons, Kolkata's success has been based on the performance of a select few players
 ballebaaji main captain gautam gambhir or openar robin uthppa to gendbaaji main shaakib al hasan or sunil naren
 It is evident that the Knight Riders would have got a boost after Naren's bowling action was cleared by the ICC
 yahaan dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki naren badale hue ection ke baad ballebaajon ko kitna pareshaan kar pate hai
 On the other hand, this time the responsibility of crossing the fleet of Delhi is on the shoulders of Zaheer Khan

 However, before the start of the tournament, captain Zaheer has relied on batsmen like JP Duminy and Quinton de Kock
 vaise dilli ke liye ek or khaas baat he ki team india ke mistar bharosemand khilaadi rahul david team ke coach hai
 Making Delhi a success in the IPL will be a great litmus test for Zaheer as well as Dravid
 pichley sizan main kolkata semifinal tak nahin pahunch saki to dilli saatven sthaan par rahi
 In such a situation, both teams will try to win the first match and catch the rhythm

 With the combination of young and experienced players in the team, Delhi have played three big bets in the auction

 There is a special belief in Hinduism about Sawan
 is maheene vivaah ke baad pehle sawan main betiyaan apane maayke jarur jaati hai
 The reason behind doing this is said to make girls feel better mentally and physically
 sawan main betiyon kaa maayke janaa ek vishesh parampara he, jiskaa nirvahan karne se betiyon ke maayke or sasuraal donon kii sthitiyaan behatar rahati hai
 Sometimes it happens that the fate of the daughters controls the fate of the entire household and as soon as the daughters farewell, the situation of the house worsens
 agar ghar main, vivaah ke baad bhi betiyon kaa sammaan na kiya jaae to bhi sthiti kaaphi bighad sakati he
 In the month of Sawan, when the daughter comes to the maternal home, then taking special measures can solve all the problems of home and life
 agar aapke ghar main kalah klesh zyada he-- beti ke ghar main aane par usase tulsi kaa ek paudha lagavaayen
 On every day your daughter stays in the house, light a lamp under basil regularly in the evening
 - iske baad beti ghar kii sukh shanti ke liye prarthana kare
 If you are unable to build a house even if you want to or are not able to buy property - after coming to the daughter's house, take jaggery from her hand on any Tuesday
 - usee din us gud ko mitti ke bartan main rakhkar mitti main dabaa den
 - Soon the desire of house and property will be fulfilled
 agar ghar main sab kuch hone ke baavjood karje badhate ja rahe hon, to beti ke sawan main aane par karen ye upaay-- beti ke ghar aane ke baad kisi bhi buudhvaar ko ye upaay karen
 - Take a betel nut from daughter's hand, wrapped in betel nut
 - us supaari ko puja ke sthaan par pile kapadey main rakh den
 - Your debts will start coming down
 agar ghar main dhan kii samasya ho to-- beti ke ghar aane ke baad kisi bhi somvaar ko praatah ye upaay karen
 - Make the daughter sit in full makeup, sit with your wife in front of you
 - beti ke haath se ek gulabi kapadey main thoda sa akshat or ek chaandi kaa sikaa le len
 - In a pink cloth, tie that letter and coin and keep it in your money place
 - beti kaa charan jarur sparsh karen

 Leaders and candidates of all the parties then formulate a strategy for the day of the vote with their booth workers etc
 kisi bhi voter se vot maangane yaa unhen prabhavit karne kii koi koshish agar prashasan yaa chunaav ayog kii najar main aata he, to us party yaa ummidavaar par karrwai kaa praavdhaan he
 Therefore, if some candidates do this, then in a very stealthy way, even avoiding the opposition party and their workers
 news reports or prachaar ko lekar media ke liye bhi chunaav ayog ke niyam yaa guide lines tay hai
 Broadly, no media institution or news channel will show anything that is unilateral once the campaign deadline is over
 niyam kanoon ke alaava ye media sansthaanon kii naitik jimmedaari bhi he ki vah agar prachaar ke aakhri din kii report shaam 6 baje ke baad bhi dikhaate hai to unamem santulan kaa khyaal rakhaa jaae
 That is, not only the report related to the promotion of any one party, but the report of the other parties or the party in the competition should also be disseminated by giving a proportionate place
 ye line is baar tut gai lagati he
 Since yesterday evening, many news channels, which will not be appropriate to name, are continuously presenting such programs or reports unilaterally, which seems that they have neither responsibility nor compulsion to balance the values
 gaanv-dehaat or shaharon main ise lekar sawaal puche ja rahe hai
 Some channels are being repeated continuously by adding old interview pieces and packaging it in a new way
 kuch ne to netaa vishesh ke bachapan se lekar is mukaam tak pahunchane ke lambey kaarykram bhi pesh kiye hai
 Those programs portray the personality of the individual from the politics to the emotional aspect in such a way that the person is being declared victorious even before the result
 kuch program to aise najar aae hai, jo kisi ke siem yaa piem banane kii kamyaabi ke baad dikhaae jate hai
 Of course whatever the pre-election assessment says, any party is expected to get any number of seats, speculation is being made about someone's defeat or victory, unilaterally during the 48 hours before the vote
 Programming falls under the category of influencing voters

 The last round of voting is scheduled on May 12
 41 siton par matdaan hona he jo apane aap main badi taadaad he
 In such a situation, glorified by focusing on a particular person or at least giving such an appearance, the events directly like the promotion of that person and his party seem
 vyaktigat taur par mujhe to aisa hi lagata he
 Media institutions or channels that have shown or are showing such programs or reports are obviously either not bothered about the Election Commission, do not care about professional ethics or have serious negligence
 anbhavi edetorial team ke rahete yah nahin mana ja saktaa ki yah sab anjaane main ho rahaa he
 It is necessary to clarify here that behind such programs or reports, i am not attacking any institution for taking money or being sold

 But are forced to punjab main kisaanon kii khudakushi kaa mudda uthaate hue kejariwal ne kaha ki ve karj na chukaa paane kii vajah se aatmahatya karne ko majaboor ho rahe hai
 Significantly, Kejriwal has raised this issue at a time when assembly elections are due in Punjab next year
 shahid diwas ke avasar par aaj dilli vidhansabha main bhagat singh, sukhdev or raajaguru kii pratimaa kaa anaavaran karne vaale kejariwal ne kaha, 'jab maalya 9,000 karod rupee kaa karj bakaayaa hone ke baad bhi bhaag gaye to unke saamne puri vyavastha laachaar najar aa rahi he
 i do not think that freedom has come in the country, which Bhagat Singh dreamed
 'tippaniyan Kejriwal said, 'there are many flaws in our system
 ek taraf maalya 9,000 karod rupee kaa karj lekar bhaag gaye, jabaki duusari ore mahaj 50,000-60,000 rupee ke karj se dabaa kisaan khudakushi karne ko majaboor he
 He said that there are many people like Mallya who owe a debt of crores of rupees
 kejariwal ne kaha ki 'bhagat singh maanate the ki sirf angrejon ko desh se nikaal dene bhar se aazaadee nahin aegi balki samrajyavad or garibi ko jad se mitaanaa hoga
 The Chief Minister said, 'recently i went to Punjab where the farmers are committing suicide
 mujhe bataaya gaya ki kisaanon ne fasalon ke liye karj liya tha, lekin fasal barbaad hone ke kaaran ve karj nahin chukaa paa rahe or khudakushi kar rahe hai
 Kejriwal said that he also came to know that some farmers committed suicide due to not being able to afford the treatment
 ' Raising the issue of farmers' suicides in Punjab, Kejriwal said that they are being forced to commit suicide due to non-payment of loans
 gauratlab he ki kejariwal ne yah mudda aise samay main uthaaya he jab punjab main agle saal vidhansabha chunaav hone vaale hai
 Kejriwal, who unveiled the statue of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in the Delhi Legislative Assembly on the occasion of Martyr's Day today, said, "when Mallya escaped even after owing a loan of Rs 9,000 crore, the entire system seems helpless to him
 
 mujhe nahin lagata ki desh main vah aazaadee ai he, jiskaa sapana bhagat singh ne dekha tha
