 iske liye kuch sharton ke saath 20 saal kaa lone tenyor miltaa he
 Apart from this, the condition is that the credit linked subsidy available under this scheme is given to a loan of only Rs 6 lakh and loan amount of additional Rs 6 lakh
 is sabsidi skim ko tab hi liya ja saktaa he, jab koi nayaa nirmaan kar rahaa he yaa phir maujuuda ghar main nayaa cameraa bananaa chahta he athwa kichna kaa nirmaan karnaa chahta he

 But going to the farmer at the time of election, talking about it is a different thing and after the election, the truth of the practice of providing cheap fertilizer, proper compensation to the farmer is beyond these election rallies

 BJP president Amit Shah has made a big bet by making Rajya Sabha MP Madanlal Saini the party state president before the assembly elections in Rajasthan
 isse bijepi ko obisi samudaay kii naaraazgi dur karne ke saath hi congress ke paramparaagat voton main send lagane main madad milegi
 Actually, former Rajasthan Chief Minister and Congress General Secretary Ashok Gehlot comes from the same Mali community from which Madanlal Saini belongs
 abhi tak gahalot kii vajah se mali samudaay congress ko vot detaa rahaa he
 Madanlal Saini's appointment is being seen as a preparation for the assembly elections as well as the Lok Sabha elections
 vahiin, rajasthan bijepi ko kareeb dhai maheene kii rassakasi ke baad apana mukhiya mil gaya
 Ashok Parnami, considered close to Vasundhara Raje, resigned as party state president after the BJP lost the by-election in Rajasthan
 iske baad se kisi duusare naam par sahmati nahin ban paa rahi thi
 BJP President Amit Shah wanted to make Union Minister of State for Agriculture Gajendra Singh Shekhawat the President of Rajasthan BJP, but CM Vasundhara Raje did not agree
 wo shrichandra kriplani ko pradesh adhyaksh banane ke paksh main thim
 Due to differences, BJP was unable to agree on any name for appointment to the post of state president
 iske chalate party pradesh adhyaksh kii niyukti kaa maamla pichley kareeb dhai maheene se lataka hua tha
 There is a BJP government in Rajasthan and assembly elections are due this year
 aise main bijepi ke liye jatigat sameekaran baitaane ke saath hi sarvamaanya chehre ko saamne rakhana behad jaruri tha
 For some time, OBC community in Rajasthan is being said to be angry with Vasundhara Raje government
 lihaaja bijepi inako bhi khush karnaa chaahati thi
 In a recent meeting with the BJP president, the BJP leader of Rajasthan had clearly stated that if Shekhawat is made BJP state president, it will be difficult to win the upcoming elections
 in netaaon kaa maananaa he ki mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje rajput samudaay se hai or shekhavat bhi rajput samudaay se aate hai
 If both of them join the Rajput community, then the other castes will get angry, which may have to bear the brunt of the election
 iske alaava rajasthan ke purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot kii badhati raajnneetik sakriyata bhi bijepi ke liye chintaa paidaa kar rahi thi
 Therefore, the BJP also needed to find Gehlot's break
 in sab ko dekhte hue bijepi ke paas madanlaal saini se behatar vikalp nahin tha
 Madanlal Saini also comes from the same Mali community from which Ashok Gehlot comes
 rajasthan main mali samudaay gahalot kii vajah se kaaphi samay se congress ko vot detaa aa rahaa he
 Now with Madanlal Saini becoming the state president, BJP can get success in making a dent in the traditional Congress votes
 iske alaava madanlaal saini rajput or jat samudaay se itar obisi se aate hai
 This will help BJP to help the OBC community as well
 bijepi pradesh adhyaksh banate hi madanlaal ne bhari hunkarrajyasabha saansad madanlaal saini ne bijepi pradesh adhyaksh kii kaman sambhalate hi jeet kii hunkaar bhari
 He said that he will fulfill whatever responsibility the party gives him and fulfill the target of winning 180 seats in the election
 unhone kaha ki ham nishchit hi vidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaav jeetenge
 Saini is also the state president of BJP Kisan Morcha
 wo do maheene pehle hi rajyasabha ke liye nirvirodh jite the

 akhilesh bole- vidhansabha jeet kar pita mulaayam ko denge giftisse pehle siem awaas par apane samarthak vidhayakon ke saath meeting kar rahe akhilesh ne behad bhavuk andaaj main kaha ki vah apane pita se alag nahin hai
 Now he will give a gift to his father Mulayam Singh by winning the assembly
 siem awaas par hui is baithak main shaamil hone ke liye sapa se nishkasit ramgopal yadav or dharmendra yadav bhi pahunche the
 At the same time, Akhilesh supporters claimed 220 MLA and MSC in this meeting
 is baithak main shaamil vidhayakon se hastakshar liye gaye or unke samarthan kii yah chitthee siem akhilesh ne mulaayam singh ko saunpa he
 Meanwhile, pro-akhilesh slogans were seen in various district offices of UP on Saturday
 vahiin mulaayam singh ke sansadeey kshetra azamgarh main kuch akhilesh samarthakon ne party daftar par bhi kabja kar liya tha
 At the same time some Akhilesh supporters shouted slogans to the SP office in Lucknow
 haalanki police ne unke raste main roak liya or is vajah se police ke saath unki jhadap bhi hui
 Akhilesh's support of the Congress and the RLD, a separate father-son meeting between the two parties in the SP, this meeting was being seen as a power test and the number of leaders involved in these meetings would determine the political situation in UP
 was about to
 bataa den ki upi vidhansabha main sapa ke paas kul 229 vidhayak or 100 sadasyeey vidhanparishad main sapa ke 67 sadsy hai
 Here CM Akhilesh has got the support of Congress, RLD and some Independent MLA
 sutron ke mutabik, akhilesh or mulaayam kii ore se bulaai gai vidhayakon kii baithak par congress paini najar he
 Now Mulayam Singh in SP, Sonia Gandhi in Congress and not Ajit Singh in RLD but Akhilesh, Rahul and Jayant are taking decisions
 bataaya jaataa he ki teenon aapas main sampark main hai
 Rahul and Jayant have given confidence to support Akhilesh
 jayant ne rahul se baat karne ke baad akhilesh ko sandesh diya ki ham sab saath hai
 sp's expelled Akhilesh and Ram Gopal tell that under the fast-changing political developments in UP, sp's national president Sakshamulayam Singh Yadav expelled Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and his brother Ram Gopal Yadav for 6 years
 akhilesh dwaraummidavaaron kii apni listjari karne, to vahiin ramgopal dwaara party kaa sammelan bulaane par mulaayam singh ne anushaasanheenata qaraar dete shuukravaar ko yah karrwai kii
 Angry at the tone of his son Akhilesh and brother Ram Gopal, SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav had said at a press conference in Lucknow that he was ending his future by misleading Akhilesh Yadav
 saath hi mulaayam ne kaha tha ki ramgopal ke bulaae adhiveshan main party netaaon or mantriyon ke shaamil hone ko bhi anushaasanheenata mana jayega
 Akhilesh had released his own separate list that means that Akhilesh Yadav had released his separate list of 235 candidates on Thursday, after which Shivpal Yadav announced 68 more names and announced the names of 393 out of 403 candidates
 ramgopal kaa kahana he ki shivpal kii aguwai main aise tamaam netaaon ko ummidavaar banaaya gaya, jinaki koi jamini pakad nahin he or chunaav main unki jamaanat tak nahin bachegi
 By raising voice against this, this wrong step of expulsion has been taken
 vahiin mukhyamantri ke kareebi sutron ke mutabik akhilesh yadav ne kaha, 'ham hi asli samaajawaadee party hai
 Netaji is still our leader
 mere pitaaji ke kareebi log apane phaayde ke liye unhen digbhramit kar rahe hai
 We are ready to contest elections based on our actions during the last five years

 We have not yet decided to tie up with anyone
 ' Bihar Health Minister Mangal Pandey made a strong comment on the leadership of Congress and RJD
 unhone kaha ki congress jald hi bihar main tuutegi
 He said that Congress will not be seen neither in Bihar nor in the country
 mangal pandeya ne yahi haal argedy kaa bhi bataaya or kaha ki usamen bhi jaldi hi tut hogi, kyonki tejasvi kaa netritv bade netaaon ko manjuur nahin he
 While Congress leaders are not interested in Rahul's leadership
 bijepi pradesh karyalayamen sahyog kaarykram main shaamil hone ke baad mantri ne patrakaron se baat karte hue kaha ki donon partiyon (congress or argedy) kaa netritv sanbhaalane vaale nausikhie hai, jinke haath main party kii kaman mil gai he
 In such a situation, who will save these parties from breaking up
 unhone kaha ki congress kii jo haalat he vahi haalat argedy kii he
 In such a situation, NDA is the only option for the leaders of both the parties
 unhone kaha ki lalu yadav ne to apane saath puure parivaar ko bhrashtachar ke makadjaal main fansaa diya he
 Mangal Pandey said that it is because of Lalu that his sons, daughters, sons-in-law, wife have come under the scanner of all investigating agencies
 akut sampatti par ab jaanch agenciyon kii najar pad gai he
 Their difficulties will not be reduced
 halanki unhone saaf kiya ki chota rajan ko jald bharat laayaa jayega
 He said that Mumbai Police and CBI will bring him and all this will be under legal process
 unhone kaha ki duusare don yani daaud or tiger ko pakadaney kii bhi koshish kii ja rahi hai

 van rank van pension (OROP) kii maang ko lekar sarkaar or purv sainikon ke bich ab or than gai he
 The news came on Sunday that the government was going to set up a commission to address the loopholes in OROP
 raksha mantri manohar parrikar disambar main iskaa elaan kar sakate hai
 But the very next minute ex-servicemen rejected the idea of this one-member commission
 kaha ki yah taalane kii chaal he
 Ex-servicemen have said that instead of forming a committee consisting of members of the heads of the three armies, the government is talking of creating a one-member commission
 vah bhi raksha mantri ke nomination se bana sadsy
 The central government announced the OROP scheme on 5 September
 iske baad bhi bhootpurv sainikon ne apana andolan jari rakhaa he
 Ex-servicemen say that what the government has announced is not 'OROP' but 'one Rank, Five Pension'
 kya chaahate hai purv sainik- sarkaar ne isi maheene 24 lakh se adhik purv sainikon or chah lakh shaheedon kii patniyon ke lieoaropi yojana aupchaarik rup se adhishuchitki thi
 But ex-servicemen do not agree
 - purv sainikon ko yah bhi naamanzoor he ki junior kii pension senior se zyada ho
 For this, he has suggested a way to review the pension every two years
 sarkaar chaahati he ki samiksha har 5 saal main ho
 - The government has excluded those taking VRS from the purview of OROP
 purv phogiyon ko yah naamanzoor he
 He says that military consists of premature retirement, not VRS
 saath hi unhone vetan ayog lagu karne kii maang bhi rakhi he
 Parrikar has said that it is not possible to fulfill all the demands
 Earlier, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar has said that in democracy everyone has the right to raise demands but all demands cannot be met
 isi maheene kii shuruyaat main unhone kaha tha ki purv sainikon kii adhiktar maangon ko puraa kar liya gaya he
 However, if the ex-servicemen feel that there is a flaw then they should speak before the government
 baatcheet karen, lekin medal na lautaaen
 The soldiers put pressure on the government this month by conducting a medal withdrawal campaign across the country
 kuch purv sainikon ne jalaae madelis bich, van rank van pension ke liye pradarshan kar rahe purv sainikon ke ek samooh ne beete hafte apane medal hi jalaane shuru kar die the
 However, there were two factions among the ex-servicemen regarding this
 sainikon ke ek samooh ne virodh ke is tareeke ko aapattijanak bataaya tha
 He said that these medals are awarded to the nation
 inhen jalaana raashtra kaa apmaan karnaa he
 While another group has justified this method
 OROP kii 3 khaas baaten1
 According to the government notification, the OROP will be effective from July 1, 2014
 purv sainikon ko arier kaa bhugtan 4 chamahi kishton main kiya jayega
 However, all widows will get this amount in one installment
 2
 The amount of pension will be fixed again after every 5 years
 yani har paanch saal main pension kii samiksha hogi
 In addition, the benefit of OROP scheme will also be given to the defense personnel who take voluntary retirement (VRS)
 3
 Applying the OROP scheme will cost around Rs 8,000 to 10,000 crore on the government exchequer
 bakaae ke bhugtan par kareeb 10,000 se lekar 12,000 karod rupee tak kharch honge

 In the recent assembly elections in Gujarat, the Congress with its allies managed to win 80 seats

 Encouraged by the Gujarat results, teamrahulisi does not want to leave any stone unturned to maintain the spirit
 koshish yahi he ki rahul gandhi kii chhavi ko logon ke jehan main behatar se behatar banaaya ja sake
 This is the reason that most attention is being paid to the image building of the Congress President on social media
 party sutron ke mutabik bijepi kii soshal media army se takaraane ke liye congress ne bhi rajyavar apni nai soshal media team taiyaar kii he
 Only a few months ago, Karnataka actress and former MP Divya Spandana alias Ramya was replaced as the head of social media, replacing Dipendra Hooda
 iske baad divya ne rajyavar nai team khadi kii, jisane bijepi kii army kaa makul jawaab dene ke liye or rahul kii puraani chhavi ko todane kii koshish kii
 The party and Khudarulco feel that their social media army was largely successful in their work
 haalanki, ek do baar adhik josh main kuch galtiyaan bhi huin, lekin overol behatar kaam ko dekhte hue un galatiyon ko nazarandaaz kiya gaya
 On behalf of the party, the coordinators of social media states also got a chance to meet Rahul

 These exercises were successful and also made headlines, for this Rahul's meeting with volunteers and members of the social media team in the states will be molded according to the state's test and flavor
 masalan, south main ye mulaakaat dose ke saath hogi, jisko 'dosa vid RG' naam diya jayega

 com / uzwq77gpjmasia Cup: Dhoni's anger on the ground, told Kuldeep- will bowling or change is maamle main bharat ke jasprit bumraah kaa ullekh karnaa jaruri he
 Bumrah has played only two matches in the series so far and has taken four wickets at an average of 15 and a strike rate of 27
 bumraah pehle do vanade maichon kii bhartiya team main shaamil nahin the
 The special thing is that he has got these four wickets in a single match (3rd ODI played in Pune)
 mumbai main khele gaye siries ke chauthe vanade main unhen koi wicket nahin mila tha
 Both teams have the best bowling analysis of the series (4 / 35)
 siries ke antim match main yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki viketon ke maamle main koi gendbaaj kuldeep ko peeche chhod paata he yaa nahin
 
 
 In this case it is necessary to mention Jasprit Bumrah of India
 bumraah ne siries main ab tak keval do match khele he or 15 ke behtareen ausat or 27 ke strike rate se chaar wicket hasil kiye he
 Bumrah was not in the Indian team for the first two odis
 khaas baat yah he ki unhone yah chaar wicket ek hi match (pune main khele gaye tisare vanade) main hasil kiye hai
 He did not get any wickets in the fourth ODI of the series played in Mumbai
 donon tiimon kii ore se siries kaa sarvshereshth gendbaaji vishleshan (4 / 35) he
 In the final match of the series, it will be interesting to see if any bowler can beat Kuldeep in terms of wickets
 
 
 bhartiya cricket team ke salaami ballebaaj rohit sharma ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki vah isisi vishwacap-2015 ke nokout jaise ahm charan main ullekhneey yogadan karnaa chaahate the
 Significantly, in the second quarter-final match of World Cup-2015 at Melbourne Cricket Ground, Rohit smashed a brilliant 137 runs, due to which the Indian team gave Bangladesh a target of 303 runs
 donon satron ke bich ke antaraal main rohit ne kaha, yah vishwacap kaa quarter final match he, isliye main ullekhneey yogadan dena chahta tha
 i am glad that we were able to score big
 ab hamen is score kaa bachaav karne kii jarurat he
 Rohit added 75 runs for the opening pair with Shikhar Dhawan (30) and 7 for the fourth wicket with Suresh Raina (65) after falling quick wickets of Dhawan, Virat Kohli (3) and Ajinkya Rahane (19)
 7 ke ausat se 122 ran jode
 Rohit said, it was necessary for me to stay at the crease, especially when we had lost many wickets
 hamen pataa tha ki melbern kii pich thodi dhimi or nichi rahegi, isliye main apana puraa samay lenaa chahta tha
 i knew that if i could last for 35 overs, then something good would happen

 On December 12, two days before the second phase of the Gujarat Assembly elections ended, BJP President Amit Shah was confident
 ahmedabad ke bahari chor par party ke vishaal mukhyalay ''kamalam" main sofe par virajman shah ne kaha, ''gujarat main hamen haraana naammumkin he or vah bhi tab jab hamaare paas modi ji sareekha netaa maujuud he or jo hamaara chunavi shubhankar he
 "shah spoke of the party's deep roots in the state and predicted winning more than 130 seats
 18 disambar kii subah jab ek-ek karke nattejey aane shuru hue, tab shah sahi to sabit hue, par sirf ek had tak hi
 The modi-shah duo truly blunted the opposition edge against them and won a sixth consecutive victory, which is just one less than the seven consecutive victories of the Left Front in West Bengal, but they somehow managed a winning streak
 Could just cross over
 party kii jholii main kul 99 siten ain, jo saadhaaran bahumat ke liye jaruri siton se mahaj saat zyada thim, balki congress or uske sahyogi dalon kii jholii main ai 80 siton se mahaj 19 hi zyada thim
 BJP 49
 1 fisadi vot hasil kiye, jo 2012 main use mili voton se ek fisadi ank zyada hai, par usne 16 siten ganvaa deen
 At the same time, with the increase in vote share by just three percentage points, Congress seats increased by 16 seats, which is its best performance since 1985
 bhaajapa ne jo 16 siten ganvaain, unamem se zyaadaatar siten isliye ganvaain kyonki mohabhang kaa shikaar ho chuke uske samarthakon ne ''uparokt main koi nahin" yaa ''nota" kaa vikalp (2015 main iviem main joda gaya) chunaa
 In all these seats, the number of voters who pressed the NOTA button was more than the margin of defeat of BJP
 masalan, uttar gujarat ke modasa main bhaajapa 200 voton se haari, jabaki nota par 3,515 vot pade
 So, if these 5,51,615 voters in these 16 seats would have pressed the claw button instead of NOTA on the voting machine, for the first time in 22 years, the BJP would have been sitting in opposition today
 to bhi yah akelaa saboot nahin he jo bataata he ki bhaajapa ko is baar gujarat main kitne kade mukaable kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The Patidar agitation severely hurt the party in the Patels-dominated saurashtra-kutch region, where it could win only 23 seats out of 54 (in 2012 it had won 35 seats)
 vah to rajya ke chaar bade shaharon—ahmedabad, surat, vadodara or rajkot main bhaajapa ne jis tarah buhaar lagaai, usee kii badaulat aakhirkaar uski naiya paar lag saki
 The BJP won 46 of the 55 seats in these cities, while it won only 53 out of the remaining 127 seats and the Congress won 71 of these seats
 agar in chaar shaharon main bhaajapa ne itnaa shandaar pradarshan nahin kiya hota, to vah gujarat ganvaa chuki thi
 However, the rural challenge of the BJP is formidable
 rajya ke 33 jilon main se saat main bhaajapa ek bhi seat nahin jeet saki or duusare aath jilon main se harek main use mahaj ek-ek seat se tasalli kerani padi
 Gujarat has sounded a warning signal for the party

 It is the small margin of victory that has led to speculation of a change in leadership in Gandhinagar

 Earlier, the Patidar agitation that started in 2015 to demand reservation for the powerful Patel community, which had around 14 per cent share in the state's electorate, had spread like wildfire, the flames of BJP in Gujarat leading to elections The walls of the fort were surrounded

 The "vikas Gando Thayo Chhe (vikas has gone mad)" meme that went viral in September, which mocked the bjp's claims of development, became so deadly that BJP workers were embarrassed to talk of development

 In October and November, the GST Council announced the removal of 178 items from 28 per cent to 18 per cent tax rate
 khud shah ne november ke madhya se gujarat main tambu gaad diya
 He started working with "kamalam" and he personally handled the party's booth management and advertising strategy

 The strategy set by the pair emphasized the bjp's rule and reminded people of experiments like providing electricity for twenty-four hours in every house of the country for the first time
 shah ne modi ke nae naare—''hum chhu vikaas, hum chhu gujarat (main hum vikaas, main hum gujarat)" ko prachaar kii ranneeti main badal diya
 The pair felt that this positive campaign would arouse the passion of Gujarati identity, especially among the influential nris of the state
 yah campan movingpixel ke chaar minute ke chote-chote video kii shrunkhlaa main ghumta tha
 This aroused the sense of Gujarati pride and fueled the negative campaign that Hardik and the Congress had waged
 paanch choti filmon main dikhaaya gaya tha ki unamem ek mukhya kirdaar vikaas ke bare main bhaajapa ke daavon par sawaal uthaata he or duusare log turshi-ba-turshi uskaa jawaab dete hai, jiskaa ant is daawey ke saath hota he ki ''mujhe apane gujarati hone par garv he
 "ultimately, the Congress also avoided negative campaigns

 In the last round of elections, Modi launched a tremendous campaign
 27 november se shuru or rajya bhar main 34 reliyon main bhumiputra kii bhaavnaatmak apil se vabsta is abhiyaan ke baad jeet pakad main dikhaai dene lagi
 Modi turned Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar's "low" remarks into a boomerang with great success, strongly attacking Kapil Sibal for asking the Supreme Court to postpone Ayodhya's decision till the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, and even Iyer Former Prime Minister to attend a banquet at the house of which Pakistan's former foreign minister Khurshid Mehmood Kasuri was also present Manmohan Singh also targeted
 modi ne apane reliyon main garajte hue kaha, ''kya congress ne pakistaniyon ko mujhe hataane kii shsupareey di he?"; ''kya ek ''neech" pradhanmantri nahin ban saktaa?" agar ye garjanaayen nahin hotin, to party yah chunaav haar sakati thi
 The Congress had made claims to formulate a booth strategy, but in spite of them, it could not prove to be a parody of Shah's absolutely unique field electoral machinery
 9 or 18 disambar ke matdaan ke donon din bhaajapa ke kaaryakarta chunavi boothon se matadaataaon ke gharon ke baar-baar chakkar lagaate rahe or apane patibaddh matadaataaon ko poling booth tak le jaakar unke vot dalwane ke shah ke nirdesh ko amali jama pahanaate rahe
 On the other hand, the Congress booths, even the strong fort of the party like the Patel-dominated Varachha area in Surat, were either deserted or completely empty

 However, seven ministers lost the election, including power minister Chiman Saparia and health minister Shankarbhai Chaudhary

 The voting pattern of the cities shows that the reforms in the GST have caused damage to the BJP
 uttar or dakshin gujarat donon main, jahaan party ne kramshah 15 or 35 siten jeetin, vah apni 2012 main jiti gai siton ke kareeb pahunchane main kaamyaab rahi
 The impact of the Patidar movement remained confined to Saurashtra and did not spread to the Patel-dominated areas of other regions

 The BJP also had to pay for the bets made to defeat Congress leader Ahmed Patel this September

 Issues such as the agrarian crisis, the PAAS movement pushing Patel for reservation as an OBC, which Hardik Patel has resolved to continue, and the entry of young leaders like Alpesh and Jignesh into the assembly have only added to the party's challenges
 Has 2014 main modi ke rashtriya str par prasthaan ke baad khaali hue netritv ko hardik jaise nae netaaon ne bhar diya he
 The newly elected government is expected to have a strong, decisive leadership to challenge them

 Government officials say a possible solution could be to unconditionally withdraw cases against all Patidar agitators, including Hardik

 goli kii aawaaj sunate hi mohit ke gharavaale upar pahunche
 Seeing Mohit bled, his senses flew away
 fouran use lekar fortis aspataal pahunche or police ko ittela kii
 After shooting the accused, he went and sat comfortably in his own house
 maukey par pahunchi police ne aaropee ko uske ghar se hi giraftaar kar liya he
 Mohit is undergoing treatment at the hospital and his condition remains critical
 mohit ke ghar waalon kaa kahana he ki aaropee aae din chat par hawaii firing karata rahata tha
 In the past too many times he was refused but he did not agree
 peedit mohit mahrauli main gym chalaata he or uske ek baccha bhi he
 Mohit is currently hospitalized and accused Neeraj in police custody, but this incident proves how Delhiites get angry at small talk and even kill each other

 ek chaatra or uske sahyogi ko ek financer kii hatya ke aarope main giraftaar kiya gaya
 The financier was asking for his outstanding money which led to his murder
 ek police adhikari ne shanivaar ko is bare main bataaya
 The accused were identified as MBA students Sumit Phogat (24) and Vikram (32)
 unhen shanivaar tadake honda chowk se giraftaar kiya gaya
 Both the accused are residents of Charkhi Dadri and Jhajjar in Haryana
 maamla brihaspativaar ko tab saamne aayaa jab yahaan sector 103 main ek flats main roshan laal kaa goliyon se chalni shav mila
 Gurgaon Police PRO Subhash Bokan said, "when the investigating officers told Lal's son Rahul about the murder, he told the police that Lal had gone to his office in Jhajjar on 31 October
 phogot unhen kahin le gayi thi
 On the basis of secret information, a police team apprehended Phogat and his accomplice
 chaanbin ke dauraan aropiyon ne police ko bataaya ki kuch doston ke jariye vah laal ko jaanate the
 Lal helped her financially and she gave some money to Phogat which she could not return
 dhan lautaane ke liye kehane par usne laal ko khatm karne kii sajeesh rachi
 She then took Lal along with Vikram from Jhajjar to Gurgaon
 iske baad unhone ek flats main sharaab pi or jab laal puri tarah nashe main tha use goli maar di gayi
 Other accused are being searched

 This is not just a request, but an instruction for every parent
 un maa-baap ke liye khaaskar, jo mahanagar main rahete hai or donon job karte hai
 Because in the metros like Delhi and Mumbai, young love is growing
 ban rahe hai kam umr main jismani rishte
 Girls are becoming pregnant at an early age
 ye chaunkaane vaala khulaasa har maa-baap ke liye he
 Do you know what your daughter is doing right now? Where is your daughter Where does she go Whom does she meet? If not, find out immediately before it is too late
 kya aap yakeen karenge ki dilli main bachapan main hi bachche bana rahe hai jismani rishte? 10veen-12veen ke 30 fisadi bachche skool main hi kho dete hai apana kunvaaraapan? kuch aankadon par najar daalen
 In Delhi, 30 percent of girls of 10th and 12th make physical relations
 bachapan main hi kho rahe hai kunvaaraapan, bachapan main hi ban rahe hai jismani rishte, 16 saal kii umr main hi kai partner
 Trend also started in girls of 12 years
 dilli main skulon main padhane vaali ladakiyon kii pregnancy main 30 fisadi kaa izaafaa
 These figures are scary
 par afsos ye sach he
 a truth that can make thousands of millions of parents sleep
 aankade beshak dilli ke hai par baaki shaharon main rahane vaale maa-baap bhi is sachai se apni ankhen naa moonden
 Do you know your children are cheating on you too? Physic relationships at an early age
 ye khulaasa isliye kaufanaak he 
 Because this surprise belongs to the doctors of big hospitals of Delhi
 pichley kuch dinon main doctoron ke paas aane vaale aise bacchon kii sankhya tezi se badi he, jo shaareerik sambandhon kii samasya ko lekar aate hai
 By the way, such news has been coming again and again from European countries and has been startling
 saal 2007 main durex global survey se saaf hua tha ki duniyabar main shaareerik sambandh banane kii umr lagaataar ghat rahi he
 In this survey it was said that in Ireland, this age is less than 15 years
 jabaki duniya bhar main ausatan 17 saal main ladkiyaan shaareerik sambandh banaati hai
 In this survey of 2007, the average age in India was 21 years
 lekin pichley 4 saalon main sab kuch badal gaya he hindustan bhi or hindustan kaa yang generation bhi
 According to a recent data, the situation in Delhi is worst in the country
 ye aankade dilli ke alag-alag aspataalon or clinicon main pahunchane vaali kam umr ladakiyon kii ginati ke aadhaar par saamne aae hai
 According to statistics, the teen-agers in Delhi, like the teen-agers of European countries, are making physical relations at the age of 12 to 16 years
 yani skool main hi unka kunvaaraapan khatm ho rahaa he
 According to the case study, about thirty percent of the girls studying in schools had already had a physical relationship before 16 years
 ye aankade isliye bhi chaunkaate hai kyonki ye kisi survey par nahin balki cese study se nikle hai
 In recent times, there has been an increase in the number of young girls reaching Delhi's major hospitals who have sex problems
 ye ladakiyon bina soche samajhe kam umr main hi sambandh bana rahi hai
 Most of the college going girls are sexually active, in the cases that we are seeing, it is not wrong to say that 80 to 90% of girls aged 18 to 20 are sexually active and have multiple boyfriends
 baat yaheen khatm nahin hoti
 The danger is even greater because the young girls of 16-18 years of age have seen the same path now
 visheshgyon ke mutabiks dilli ke skulon main padhane vaali 12-13 saal kii ladkiyaan bhi ab is andhi res main shaamil ho chuki hai
 According to experts, the relationship for teen-agers is more emotional less physical

 mangalvaar ko bal diwas kaarykram main parrikar ne apni yuvavastha main 'edlt film' dekhne ke anubhav ko saajha kiya
 Former defense minister Parrikar, in response to a student's question, said what kind of movies he used to watch during his youth? Parrikar said, "we didn't just watch movies, we have seen adult films of that time
 " unhone kaha ki aaj aap ab bahut-si chijen tivi par dekh rahe hai, jo puraane samay main edlt film main dikhaaya jaataa tha
 Parrikar said, "was a popular adult film
 main us samay vayask tha
 Me and my brother went to see it
 interval ke dauraan, jab lite jali to maine ehsaas kiya ki meraa padosi mere bagal main baitha he
 This neighbor often spoke with my mother in the evening
 maine khud se kaha ki ham maare gaye
 "goa CM Parrikar said that he and his brother Avdhoot left the film in the middle and ran away from the cinema hall
 ghar jate samay unhone sankat se nipatane ke liye pehle se hi yojana bana lee thi
 He said, "when we reached home, i told my mother that we had gone to see the film and we did not know that the film was pornographic
 hamane film bich main hi chhod di
 i very simply told them that our neighbors were also there and i fell silent
 "unhone kaha, "agle roj hamaare padosi ne bahut utsahit hokar hamaari maa ko bulaayaa or kaha ki manohar or avadhoot edlt film dekhne gaye the
 My mother told him that i know which movie he went to see, but why did you go to see that film? You have to think a few things in advance

 On September 9, 2018, these five died while cleaning the sewer at the Capital Green DLF apartment in West Delhi
 kya aapako dilli ke ghitorani ilaake ke swarna singh, deepu, anil or balvinder yaad hai
 On 14 July last year, these people died of suffocation while cleaning the sewer
 6 agast 2017 ko lajpat nagar ke yogendra or anu kii dam ghutane se maut ho gai
 On 21 August 2017, Rishipal was also killed while cleaning sewer in Delhi
 30 sitambar 2017 ko gudgaanv main rinku, rajkumaar or nina kii maut ho gai thi
 You must have forgotten Aman Kumar, Prem Kumar Kaka of Punjab's swimming pool
 bathinda ke jagadish singh, ravi hon yaa phir patna ke jitendra or deepu
 Why would t Naidu of Bangalore want to remember Anjeya and Yeraiya
 shahdara ke jahangir, ejaz, noida ke rajesh, vikaas, rabindra, mumbai ke vishwanath singh, ramnath singh, satyanarayan singh, rameshwar singh ye sab ve log hai jo is khai main dubaa kar maar die gaye
 Deepak and Armaan of Ludhiana, Gangadhar of Muktsar, Bitti Kumar of Punjab, Jagdish Kumar Ravi and Surendra Kumar
 jis desh main swatchta ke naam par ghanto tivi ke event phoonk die jate hon, jagah jagah deevaaron par naare likhane ke liye karodon phoonk die jate hai
 After all, what we could not do was that nobody should die while cleaning the sewer
 swatchta ke naam par saaf suthri jagahon par jhaadu chalaakar photo khinchaa lene se hamen prachaar ke alaava kya mila agar hamane siver kii safai karte vakt hone vaali maut ko kaabo nahin kiya
 Every death has a different story but the reason is one
 ham siver main utar kar safai karne waalon kii raajnneetik nautanki ke liye to sammaan karte hai magar unki suraksha kaa khyaal nahin karte hai
 The sewer sweepers do not receive any safety equipment nor their special training
 kab tak siver main utar kar safai hogi, kya yahi ek tarika bachaa he
 At least in the name of cleanliness, under the campaign, they would get equipment and training, and then take photos and re-tweet
 das saal kaa gaurav apane pita kii tasviir bana rahaa he
 The letter is writing how they will fulfill the promise of new bicycle
 uske pita anil kii maut dwarka main siver kii safai karte vakt dam ghutane se ho gai
 The rope given was not strong
 tut gai or vah mar gaya
 He drowned in a sewer 20 feet deep
 gaurav kii ek bahan bhi he
 This condition was not seen from the Uday Foundation
 anil ke parivaar ke paas atyeshti ke bhi paise nahin the
 After watching this news, Rahul Verma sought help from people through crowd funding
 sarkaar or system se zyaada aam log tezi se saamne aa gaye
 He could not return to Gaurav's father, but did fulfill his father's promise
 gaurav ke paas nai cycle pahunch gai
 Within a few hours people deposited more than 3 million money from their pocket
 rahul verma ne twit kiya he ki saare paise ko fiks deposit kiya jayega, iske interest se jo paisa aayega usase gaurav kii padhai hogi
 At 18, he will get all the money so that he can decide his future life
 rahul verma ne kaha ki agar logon ne yah kaam nahin kiya hota to ho saktaa tha ki garibi gaurav ko apane pita ke kaam kii ore le jaati
 i wish the system would be active like Rahul Verma, then it would not come
 messej yahi he ki log to milakar madad kar denge, ve peeche nahin hatate hai lekin jab tak is samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin hoga, vyavastha nahin hoga ham bhavukta se dam ghutane se hone vaali mauton ko roak nahin paaenge
 The Supreme Court also orders that if someone dies while cleaning the sewer, the government will give 10 lakh
 kya har kisi ko das lakh kii yah raashi mil jaati he
 Whereas in 2014, the Supreme Court had ordered and said that all those who have died since 1993 should be given ten lakhs
 kya die gaye, yah bhi ek sawaal he
 With this message, Bezwada Wilson and his colleagues of the Safai Karmachari Andolan demonstrated on the ITO
 baqayda supreme court kaa aadesh he ki kitni bhi apaat sthiti ho, bina suraksha upaay, upkarnon or vastron ke siver main janaa aparaadh he
 Nobody can force it
 iske baad bhi aisi ghatnaayen kam nahin hui hai
 But everyone's figures are different
 safai karmchaaree andolan kaa kahana he ki dilli main 2016 se 2018 ke bich siver main kaam karne se 429 logon kii maut hui he
 So far this year, 83 people died due to working in the sewer, out of which six lost their lives in the last one week
 udhar rashtriya safaai karmchaaree ayog (NCSK) ke mutabik janvari 2017 se ab tak desh bhar main sirf 123 safaai mazaduron ne apni jaan ganvaai he
 Its figures are mostly based on newspaper reports
 iske mutabik 2017 main 96 logon or 2018 main 13 logon kii siver kii safaai kii vajah se maut hui
 The comments 2017 se ab tak ke aankade bataate hai ki har paanch din main ek aadmi kii maut hoti he
 The Indian Express has published a report by Shalini Nair, who has also received the Ladli Media Award
 samasya yah he ki manhole saaf karne ke liye theke par hi log kyon rakhe jate hai
 Why municipalities keep a record of these kitne karmchaaree hai or kitnon kii maut hui he
 In January 2015, the Brihanmumbai Municipality had reported that 1386 sanitation workers have died in the last six years i
e
 between 2009 and 2015 and this number is increasing
 prexis naam kii sanstha ne ek report banaai thi 'down di dren'
 After studying 200 sewer cleaners in this report, Dr
 ashish mittal ne bataaya tha ki agar hidrogen sulphide kii maatra adhik he to ek baar saans lene se hi maut ho jaaegi
 The pattern of death is such that three die simultaneously
 ek jab nahin aata he to doosraa jaataa he use dekhne teesraa jaataa he
 a junior engineer has also died in Delhi
 80 fisadi siver saaf karne vaale ritairement age tak nahin pahunch pate hai
 Many diseases surround them and they die prematurely
 isiilie aap dekhte hai ki ek saath chaar yaa paanch log maar jate hai
 Be it Jagdish Singh of Bathinda, Ravi or Jitendra and Deepu of Patna
 bangaloru ke tii naidu, anjeya or yeraiya ko kyon yaad rakhana chahenge
 Jahangir, Ejaz of Shahdara, Rajesh of Noida, Vikas, Ravindra, Vishwanath Singh of Mumbai, Ramnath Singh, Satyanarayana Singh, Rameshwar Singh are all those who were drowned in this ditch
 ludhiana ke deepak or armaan, muktsar ke gangadhar, punjab ke bitti kumaar, jagadish kumaar ravi or surendra kumaar
 In the country where hours of TV events are blown in the name of cleanliness, crores of people are blown to write slogans on walls
 aakhir ham kya nahin kar sake ki siver kii safai karte vakt kisi kii jaan na jaae
 What did we get apart from publicity by taking a broom in clean and clean places in the name of cleanliness if we did not control the death caused by cleaning the sewer
 har maut kii alag alag kahani he magar kaaran ek he
 We respect the political gimmick of the scavengers by descending into the sewer but do not take care of their safety
 siver main safai karne waalon ko na to suraksha ke upkaran milte hai or na unki khaas training
 By when will the sewer be cleaned, is this the only way left? kam se kam swatchta ke naam par jo abhiyaan chalate hai usee ke tahat inhen upkaran milte or training milti, or phir photun khichataa or jiskaa ri-twit hota
 Ten-year-old Gaurav is photographing his father
 patr likh rahaa he ki nai cycle kaa vaada kaise puraa karenge
 Her father Anil died of suffocation while cleaning the sewer in Dwarka
 jo rassi di gai wo majboot nahin thi
 Broke and he died
 vah 20 feet gahare siver main dub gaya
 Gaurav also has a sister
 udai foundation se unki yah haalat nahin dekhi gai
 Anil's family did not have much money
 is khabar ko dekhne ke baad rahul verma ne croud funding ke zarie logon se madad maangi
 More common people came out faster than government and system
 ve gaurav ke pita ko nahin lautaa sake, magar pita kaa vaada zarur puraa kar diya
 Gaurav got a new bicycle
 chand ghanton ke bheetar logon ne apni jeb se 30 lakh se adhik paise jamaa kar die
 Rahul Verma has tweeted that all the money will be fixed fixed, the money that will come from its interest will teach Gaurav
 18 saal hone par use wo sara paisa mil jayega jisase wo aage kii zindagi kaa faisla kar sake
 Rahul Verma said that if people had not done this work then it could have been that poverty would have taken Gaurav towards his father's work
 kaash system rahul verma kii tarah sakriy hota to yah naubat hi nahin aati

 unhone aage likhaa ki ‘
 
 lekin nikamma anupasthit kyon tha?’ ab sanjay nirupam iske jariye kisapar nishaanaa saadh rahe hai, ye to vah hi behatar bataa sakate hai lekin soshal media par unke is twit ke saath hi tufaan aa gaya he
 Many social media users see this tweet as an attack on Congress leader Milind Deora
 gauratlab he ki donon netaaon ke bich pichley kuch dinon se thik nahin ban rahi he or donon kii anban lagaataar khulkar saamne aa rahi he
 Sanjay Nirupam was not present at the recent Rahul Gandhi rally in Mumbai
 kya congress chodenge sanjay nirupam?bataa den ki beete dinon sanjay nirupam ne press conference karte hue congress party ke kuch netaaon par sawaal khadey kar die the
 In fact, Sanjay Nirupam was very angry about the ticket distribution and was alleging that none of the candidates of his choice had been given tickets
 sanjay nirupam ne press conference kar congress netaaon par sawaal khadey kiye the or saath hi party chhodane tak kii baat kah di thi
 At the same time, he had said not to campaign in the assembly elections
 film 'singhm riterns' ko diarect kiya he rohit shetty ne or iske mukhya kalakaar hai, ajay devgan, karina kapur, anupam kher, amol gupte, dayanand shetty, zakir hossain, sharat saxena or mahesh manjrekar
 Those who have seen the first 'singham' will know how Inspector Bajirao Singham fights against the corrupt leader and the system, with similar expectations from 'singham Returns'
 singhm ab disipi ban chukaa he or use talash he un logon kii jo kaale dhan kaa istemaal vot kharidne ke liye karte hai, saath hi use police kii vardi par lage daag ko bhi dhonaa he
 To know how Singham will do it, you will have to watch the film
 ab main aapako bataaungaa ki mujhe film kisi lagi? pehali baat 'singhm riterns' main script or screenple kii, to mujhe utana saaf yaa sahaj dhang se badhata nazar nahin aayaa, jitna pehali 'singhm' main aayaa tha
 Secondly, while watching the film, you will be able to predict what can happen in the film, it was rarely seen in 'singham'
 teesri baat film main kai jagah police kii haalat or janata kaa uske prati nazariyaa dikhaaya gaya he, jo he to acchhee baat, lekin use script or screenple main dhang se gadha nahin gaya
 Rohit Shetty's film is obviously an action scene, but in the film, these scenes seem a bit long to me
 yun to film main gane na ke baraabar hai par yah film kii raftaar ko bhi kam karte hai or kuch khaas manoranjan bhi nahin karte
 Now the merits of the film Bari
 bajirao singhm is baar phir baaji maar le gaya
 In many scenes, i felt that this character would probably not fit on anyone other than Ajay
 ajay ne apane kirdaar main acting or heroism donon bhare hai
 As many scenes as Kareena, she fills the screen with energy and her comedy makes laughter
 ection seens lambey zarur hai, par rohit ne kuch stants behtareen dhang se dizin kiye hai or saath hi ajay ne unhen bakhubi nibhaayaa he
 This time the film and film stunts are closer to reality
 commercial filmon ke nirdeshak rohit ne jaise apni chhavi se upar uthte hue ek koshish kii he, haalanki vah 'singhm riterns' ko apane style kii film bana sakate the
 Many scenes convey the pain of policemen well to the general audience
 amol gupte kii acting main mujhe theatre zyada najar aayaa
 Zakir fit his character
 becoground score film main jaan daalata he
 The end of the film may not be ashamed of some people, but on the occasion of Independence Day, 'singham Returns' will entertain you and awaken the spirit of patriotism
 meri taraf se film ko 3 stars

 We do not want to obstruct the work of RBI nor to curtail its rights
 "nyaayalay ne kaha ki is tarah ke vittiya maamalon main arabiai hi nyaayadhish hoga, na ki adaalat

 gauratlab he ki pakistani suraksha agenciyon ne daawa kiya tha ki laden ke pakistan main maujuudagi ke bare main unhen koi jaankaree nahin thi

 There was no partner left in Maharashtra, after Sharad Sangma and Tariq Anwar left the NCP, now Sharad Pawar's partner in Maharashtra is also continuously leaving him just before the assembly elections
 ensipi kaa saath chhodane vaale sansthaapak sadasyon main ganesh nik, madhukar pichad or akola se unke vidhayak putr vaibhav pichad, vijay singh mohite patil or unke bete ranjit singh patil, padma singh patil or sachin ahir kaa naam pramukh hai
 These are the names of the NCP who together with Sharad Pawar laid the foundation of the party and played an important role in strengthening it in the politics of Maharashtra
 ensipi kaa saath chhodane vaale netaa netaa zyaadaatar bijepi kaa daaman tham rahe hai
 After this, Shiv Sena is becoming the choice of the second number
 aise main ensipi ke saamne apane astitv ko bachaae rakhane kii badi chunauti he
 Pawar has given power to NCP in such a way that this NCP came into existence on the basis of those who were supporters of Pawar in Congress
 isliye unke paas sthaneey raajnneetik santhaan, saadhan or kaaryakarta the
 Therefore, the challenges that the NCP faced as a new party did not face them
 sharad pavaar apane raajnneetik kaushal ke jariye jald hi ensipi ko sattadhari party ke rup main sthapit kar diya tha
 Because of this the NCP along with Congress remained in power for 15 years
 sharad pavaar ke netritv ke kaaran shuruaati daur se hi party kaaryakarta behad sakriy rahe or yuva kaaryakarta bhi bade paimaane par ensipi ke saath bane rahe
 It is due to Pawar that NCP has made an important place in the politics of the nation
 isliye party ke rajya ke samarthak hameshaa utsahit rahete hai or unhen aashaa rahati he ki unki party kaa kad badhegaa
 The NCP faced a shortage of resources left to save a political future after the NCP withdrew from power in 2014
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki ensipi main duusare dalon se aae netaaon ke saath-saath party ke buniyaad rakhane vaale netaa bhi apana siyaasi bhavishya bachaane ke liye surakshit jagah talashne main jute gaye hai
 As a result, the Sharad Pawar family alone is left in the NCP

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi celebrated his 49th birthday on Wednesday 19 June
 dilli congress adhyaksh shila dikshit ne rahul gandhi ke janmdin par congress karyaalay main ek paudha lagaaya
 a large number of Congress workers were also present on this occasion along with Congress leaders
 shila dikshit ne is avasar par congress ke rashtriya adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko unke janmdiwas par badhai or shubhakamanaayen dete hue kaha ki karodon deshavaasiyon ke lokapriy netaa ke rup main rahul gandhi kii manyata he or congress nishchit rup se unke pratibhashali netritv main safalataa praapt karegi
 Sheila Dixit told the Congress workers after planting the saplings that they should plant at least one plant in their respective areas, because the lack of green area in Delhi is spoiling the environment in Delhi
 shila dikshit ne kaha ki jab dilli main congress satta main thi, tab unke kaarykaal main 15 varshon tak dilli kaa harith kshetra badhaane ke liye har sambhav prayaas kiye gaye, lekin pichley kuch samay se kejariwal sarkaar ke dauraan dilli is baat kii gavaah he ki dilli kaa harith kshetra gata he, jiske parinamswaroop dilli main vayumandaleey pradooshan badha he or haal ke varshon main pradooshan kaa str kai baar khatre ke str ko paar kar chukaa he
 Sheila Dixit said that ever since the BJP government has come to the center and the Aam Aadmi Party government has been formed in Delhi, the green area in Delhi has been decreasing rapidly, because both governments are constantly cutting down trees, not worrying about the environment
 Huh
 iske alaava pradhanmantri narendra modi samet kai netaaon ne rahul gandhi ko unke janmdin kii badhai di
 PM Modi tweeted, 'happy Birthday to Rahul Gandhi
 ishwar unako acha swasthya or lambii aayu pradaan karen
 At the same time, Rahul Gandhi has thanked Prime Minister Modi for this congratulation

 In this picture, a school child and teacher in Assam's Dhubri district were hoisting the tricolor by submerging it in flood water
 adoncent and child ritis network assam (asiarene) ke pramukh dow
 Chiranjeeb Kakote asks, can this picture become a symbol of national pride? In fact, there are dozens of schools in Assam which get stalled due to floods during the rainy season
 aise main asiarene ne kareeb 21 sansthaaon ke saath milakar is baar chunavi ghoshnaa patr main bacchon ke muddon ko tarjeeh dilwane kaa ek nayab tarika khoja

 chiranjeeb cacote ne bataaya, ek saal aath maheen kii baari mashkkat ke baad is suchi ko taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Dr
 cacote kehete hai, in muddon ko tay karte vakt na bacchon ko koi disha nirdesh die gaye or na hi unke muddon main kaat chhaant kii gai
 The team, which met the children on behalf of the organization, told them just the purpose of this process
 ve kehete hai, koi bhi siyaasi dal bacchon ke muddon ko tarjeeh nahin detaa
 Perhaps the reason for this is not to be a voter at present, but keep in mind that these children will also become voters tomorrow
 kya hai muddehar saal baadh aati he or har saal skool thap hote hai
 Many schools in Assam open only occasionally during the rainy season
 yah samasya har saal kii he lekin kisi bhi sarkaar kaa dhyaan is taraf nahin jaataa
 As such, the issue of flood management has been prominently included in the list
 safai, skulon main shauchalay, swasthya, kuposhan, maa or bachche kii mrityu dar, anganbari main maa or bacchon ke swasth kii dekhbhaal, mid de mile or sabase jaruri baadh ke dauraan thap hone vaali shiksha vyavastha ke liye jaruri kadam uthaanaa
 Issues of child labor, child trafficking, child marriage were also included in the list

 Child party from political parties About 500 children from the state met representatives of five political parties and submitted their agenda papers
 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa), congress, assam gana parishad (agap), ol india united democratic frans (eiudief), bodoland pipuls front (bipief) ko bacchon kaa ek pratinidhi dal apana agenda saunp chukaa he
 BJP, AGP, AIUDF have also assured that they will include the agenda of the children in their manifesto
 
 
 
 Mangdaw will raise children in more states
 chiranjeeb cacote ne kaha, philhal abhi ek rajya main hamane yah pahal kii he
 Our network is in Assam only
 lekin duusare rajyon ke sanghathan bhi bacchon ke agenda par agar kaam karnaa chahenge ham unke saath jarur shaamil honge
 We are currently waiting for the declaration of the parties
 is anuthi pahal ke saath assam desh kaa pehla aisa rajya ban gaya he jahaan bacchon ne loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan siyaasi dalon ko apana agenda patr saunpa he
 If this initiative is successful, in other states too, political parties can come forward to pay attention to the issues of children

 Bangladeshi player Nurul Hasan, who has been on the field, has apologized for his mistake and he has also been fined 25 per cent of the match fees
 unke khate main bhi ek dimerit ank gaya he
 Match referee Broad had said on the incident, 'I understand that this was a result of the tension inflicted on Maidan, but such behavior of two players cannot be tolerated

 They are welcomed everywhere

 In fact, after Abhinandan's return, Salman Khurshid welcomed him on his Twitter account, writing that Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Vardhman received a flying badge in 2004 and trained as a fighter pilot during the UPA government
 
 khurshid ne shanivaar ko twit kiya, ‘shatru kii aakraamakata ke saamne bhartiya pratirodh ke chehre wing commander abhinandan vardhaman (abhinandan Varthaman) ko bahut-bahut badhai
 He showed great balance and confidence during difficult times
 hamen is baat par garv he ki vah 2004 main vayusena main shaamil hue or samprag ke dauraan ek fiter payalat bane''
 On this tweet by Salman Khurshid, he had to face criticism on social media
 haalanki soshal media par aalochana jhelane ke baad khurshid (salman Khurshid) ne ravivaar ko kaha ki unhone ‘sirf sach kaha'
 Many kudos for Wing Commander abhi Varthaman the face of India's resistance to enemy aggression
 Great poise and confidence in face of adversity
 "we were proud that he received his wings in 2004 and matured as fighter pilot during UPA," he told reporters
 "I said that he joined the Indian Air Force during our tenure
 maine sirf sach bolaa'
 Let me tell you that after the Pulwama terror attack, on 26 February, India attacked the terrorist bases of Jaish, which were on Pakistani territory
 bhartiya vayusena ne pakistan ke balakot main jaish e mohammad keatanki shivi par 1000 kilo ke bam giraayethe

 After this Pakistan's anger started coming out and it tried to reject the claim of India
 Sir, if only even you had matured during UPA term, you wouldn't have tweeted this non-sense
 
 beete dinon uttar pradesh bijepi kii kaarysmiti kii suchi jari hui
 Varun Gandhi's name is missing from this list
 'aaj tak' ne jaise hi is babat sawaal kiya, uttar pradesh bijepi main hallaa much gaya
 Not only this, the party says that it will issue a new revised list further
 haalanki, yah abhi bhi spasht nahin he ki nai list main varun shaamil honge yaa nahin
 In this list of BJP, the names of many senior leaders from many districts are also missing
 isamen sabase charchit naam varun gandhi or smriti irani kaa he
 According to BJP sources, Smriti Irani was not included in the list as she is a Rajya Sabha member from Gujarat, but questions arise as to why Varun's name is missing? The list received by the senior leader of 'aaj Tak' Koopi BJP, includes the names of more than 250 BJP leaders
 suchi main shaamil he menka gandhi kaa naamatin shreniyon main banty is suchi main vishesh aamantrit sadsy, sthai aamantrit sadsy or kshetravaar pradesh kaarysmiti ke sadasyon kii suchi di gai he
 While none of the three have Varun Gandhi's name
 haalanki, inamen varun gandhi kii maa or kendriya mantri menka gandhi kaa naam sthai aamantrit suchi main shaamil kiya gaya he
 In the absence of Varun's name, state president Keshav Maurya's office was also cleaned
 maury ke nijee sahaayak ne bataaya ki kaarysmiti kii jo suchi jari kii gai he or isamen kuch naam chhot gaye hai, jisamen sanshodhan kar nae sire se suchi jari kii jaaegi
 However, it is still unclear whether Varun Gandhi's name will be included in the revised list? Why is there no Varun Gandhi's name in the State Working Committee, and how can he miss such a big name in the list? Even on this question, no satisfactory answer could be obtained from the office of the State President
 varun ke daftar se nahin mila pusht javabdusri ore, varun gandhi ke daftar ne naam na hone ke sawaal par kaha ki unhen is bare main koi aadhikarik suchi nahin mili he or party kii parampara ke mutabik, sabhi nirvaachit saansad or rashtriya kaarysamit ke sadsypradesh kaarysmitimein swatah sadsy maane jate hai
 However, Varun Gandhi's personal assistant could not answer the question that when the names of all senior leaders from UP PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Rajnath Singh and Maneka Gandhi and prominent mps of UP have been included in the list
 Then why won't Varun's name be forgotten? In the reform case, UP BJP state organization minister Sunil Bansal also clarified the picture
 unhone kaha ki upi se rashtriya kaarysmiti main shaamil sabhi netaa pradesh kaarysmiti main bhi swatah shaamil maane jate hai
 The names of all the senior leaders of UP have also been included in the State Working Committee in the National Working Committee
 bhul se pradesh kii nai suchi main kuch naam chhot gaye the, pradesh kaarysmiti kii baithak ke pehle is bare main sanshodhit suchi jari kar bhul sudhaar kar liya jayega
 April 6 is bjp's foundation day

 bijepi ne is din kaa istemaal matadaataaon ke bich bitaane or unhen party ke liye matdaan karne kii apil karne ke liye tay kiya he
 The party's plan is that big leaders and workers should directly contact two to three crore voters in five lakh polling areas

 His job is to bring the 15-20 voters registered on that page to the polling booth
 6 april ko is team ko poling booth ke har ghar main jane ke liye kaha gaya he
 They will spend 15-20 minutes there and explain to the people why it is important for Narendra Modi to become Prime Minister
