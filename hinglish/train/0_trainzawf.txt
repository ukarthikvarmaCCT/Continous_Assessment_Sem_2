 At the time of crisis, a group of top officials was eagerly waiting for Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, adorned with Tilak Hall, a wood panel

 In fact, a major reason for the problem of Uttar Pradesh under the sp's rule is also revealed by this incident
 masalan, isamen sabhi teenon aaropee yadav hai
 Two local policemen defending him are also Yadavs and political leaders trying to divert the incident aside are trying to preserve their vote bank
 har keemat par is gundaraj ko bachaae rakhane ke liye apane pita or chaachaaon ke bayanon se 40 varshiya akhilesh yadav ke tevar bhi itane chadh gaye ki unhone 31 may ko ek mahila reporter se kaha, ‘‘aap to surakshit hai yaa nahin?’’ us mahila reporter ne unase rajya main mahilaon ke khilaaf lagaataar bad rahe aparaadhon ke bare main sawaal kiya tha
 The Uttar Pradesh government is now spending crores of rupees on such advertisements which state that the crime figures are not really increasing in the state and rape cases are more in other states
 lekin ye vigyaapan desh ke sabase zyada aabaadi vaale rajya kii traasadee hi jaahir karte hai
 In the last few years, issues of discussion have revolved around development, investment, infrastructure and human development index in Narendra Modi's Gujarat, Shivraj Singh Chauhan's Madhya Pradesh, Naveen Patnaik's Odisha and even Nitish Kumar's Bihar
 Uttar Pradesh is still deeply involved in its crime figures

 But those who have knowledge, they also get to say that this is still 4
 8 fisadi ke rashtriya ausat se zyada hi he
 On the contrary, despite all the corruption charges, the growth rate of BSP leader Mayawati was kept between 7 and 8 percent
 ek aalaa adhikari vyangy main kehete hai, ‘‘yah kuch aisa hi he jaise third divijan main paas hone vaala ladkaa apane maa-baap se kahe ki ‘‘to kya hua, meraa dost to do vishay main fail he
 "hardly anyone in the state secretariat remembers when the officers' meeting was called before for infrastructure, economy or planning items
" ’’lekin agar yah maan len ki akhilesh sarkaar kaa mukhya focus aparaadh niyantran par hi rahaa he to is morche par bhi vah buree tarah naakaam sabit hui he
 It is evident from the data of National Crime Records Bureau that the cases of murder, rape and dacoity in the state have increased only marginally in the last three years, but the general perception is that due to lack of reporting of most cases
 ek aalaa police adhikari kehete hai, ‘‘kanoon-vyavastha kaa adarsh niyam yah kahata he ki aankadon se zyada mahatvapurn aam dharna hoti he or is morche par akhilesh sarkaar buree tarah naakaam he
 "actually the problem is arising due to three main reasons
 ek, march 2012 main satta main aane ke mahaj haftebhar baad akhilesh ne us faisle ko badal diya jo puure uttar pradesh main pulisavaalon kii tainaati apane grih jile or padosi jile main karne se roktaa tha or is tarah police main jatiyon kaa dabadabaa kaayam nahin hone detaa tha
 For example, Jatas could not be deployed in the south-west between Etawah and Mainpuri in the Yadavas or in Muzaffarnagar and Meerut in western Uttar Pradesh
 ek duusare aalaa police adhikari kehete hai, ‘‘is niyam ke badalane se pulisavaale apane gaanv ke aasapaas tainaati maangane lage hai
 There they can be someone's uncle, someone's brother or they can be hated by someone, so he cannot play the role of a policeman away from prejudice
 is badlaav se pehle se hi bhrasht pulisia vyavastha main ek nayaa adhyay jud gaya
 "(these are the five and a half chief ministers of UP - Mulayam Singh Yadav, Ram Gopal Yadav, Anita Singh, Azam Khan, Shivpal Singh Yadav - top to bottom, and half the Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav)
 Arrangements were made - the partisan role of the policemen posted in their home districts was not only seen during the recent rape of Badaun, but also allegedly in 2013
 In Ujffrnagr riots had also appeared, where finally the army had to be called
 shaayad in vajahon se hi aakhirkaar 7 june ko akhilesh ne apana 2012 kaa faisla badal diya
 After this, 40,000 policemen posted in their own or neighboring districts are to be transferred now for the last 27 months
 duusare, rajya ke 1,560 police thanon ke thanedaar yaa prabharee inspector kaa chunaav ek board kiya karata he jo tainaati ke pehle giraftaar ke record, adhikariyon ke khilaaf aapraadhik maamle, bhrashtachar vagairah jaise maamalon par gaur karata rahaa he
 This policy was changed to give preference to Yadavs, especially under Akhilesh's rule
 yadav jati-sambandh rakhane vaale ab rajya ke 800 thanon ke prabharee hai
 Many of the inspectors have direct access to the SP leadership and some of them are so influential that they transfer their sps through a phone
 satta ke is asantulan se aisi ghatnaayen hoti hai jiskaa hawalaek mahanideshak ne diya-elahabaad sambhag ke ek thane main police ne ek aadmi ko desi pistaul ke saath pakadaa or thane main band k r diya
 After that a local SP leader came to the police station, asked for the lockup keys, opened the lock himself and walked out silently carrying the man with a seized desi pistol
 yah kissa sunaane vaale mahanideshak kehete hai, ‘‘aisa dussahas thanedaar kii shah ke bina sambhav nahin tha
 a theory of law and order says that a systematic criminal incident or riot always arises in the mind of the police station and its end is also in his mind
 ’’or tisare, sangathit aparaadh or aatank se nibatane ke liye uttar pradesh police kii do sabase prabhavi shakhaon-vishesh kaarybal (estf) or aatankarodhi dasta (aties)-ko hi nai vyavastha main nakh-danta viheen kar diya gaya he
 The STF, which conducted about 100 operations during 2007 and 2012, was able to play a part in less than 10 operations under Akhilesh's rule
 estf se jude rahe ek aalaa afasar kehete hai, ‘‘estf kii takat ghatane se kabhi haashie par chale gaye apradhi sarganaon ne phir se sir uthaa liya he
 "failure to understand these basic principles of law and order has become a problem for Akhilesh in understanding the remaining policy matters
" uttar pradesh sachivalay main yah aam dharna he ki mukhyamantri kii prashasan ke maamalon main khaas dilchaspee nahin he
 Often they are lost in their Blackberry phones while discussing such matters in meetings

 For example, Akhilesh's communication with the Department of Industries in the last eight months has been limited to mentioning promises of subsidy of Rs 6,000 crore to some companies, which Mulayam Singh made during his Chief Minister's tenure
 taur-tareekon main nai tejaimukhyamantri sakriy to hue lekin puraani aadaten or taur-tareeke kaaymarajy main june ke shuru main jab taapmaana 47 degree chune laga to bijli katautee ke kaaran gorakhpur or gonda main bijli ke daftar main tod-phod kii gai or agra tathaa meerut main bijli daftar waalon ko dhamkaaya gaya
 On 5 June, the junior engineer of Utretia power house in Lucknow was taken hostage by the local residents
 kuch logon kaa kahana tha ki akhilesh sarkaar loksabhaa chunaav main party kekharaab pradarshan kaa badla le rahi he
 But top officials say the problem is not institutional motives, but of intentions and intentions
 rajya main har roj bijli kii maang 14,000 megawatt he jabaki sirf 12,500 megawatt bijli kii hi vyavastha ho paati he
 The transmission losses in the state's power units are about Rs 7,000 crore annually
 bijli vibhaag ke ek aalaa adhikari k hate hai, ‘‘vitaran ke network main sudhaar kiye bina koi raahat kii gunjaaish nahin he
 '' And this work may take years
 lekin akhilesh ke paas to ab aage bataur mukhyamantri sirf teen garmiyaan hi baaki hai, isliye unke liye samay teji se bhaagta ja rahaa he
 Akhilesh is trying to prove himself by stepping out of his comfort zone amidst crisis after crisis and demand of government sacking by opposition parties
 ve achaanak puri chusti dikhaane lage hai lekin yah bhi sahi he ki apane parivaar ke sadasyon kii jakadaaon ke kaaran paidaa hui niskriyata ke kaaran rajya main yadav birdari ko apni chalaane kii shah milti rahi he
 The preference of Akhilesh Raj has also ended with preference for loyalty in the selection of officers
 june ke shuru main nai afasarshahi pherbadal main akhilesh mukhya sachiv javed osmani ke badale adhik sakriy alok ranjan ko le aae
 But his selection of Deepak Singhal as Principal Secretary (home) is under doubt
 tamaam sanket yahi hai ki ve mulaayam kii pasand hai
 There were allegations of corruption against Singhal during his posting in the Union Ministry of Chemical and Fertilizers, for which the Central Government also punished him
 darasal, sapa main anek faisle yadav kunbe ke sadasyon kii khaas toli kii sahmati se hi kiye jate hai
 The only outsider in this small circle is sometimes called Azam Khan, the Muslim face of the party
 haalanki akhilesh apane chachaa ramgopal ke zyada kareeb hai or sage chachaa shivpal se unki patari nahin baithti lekin parivaar kii parampara ko dhyaan main rakhkar ve donon main se kisi kii baat taalane kaa saahas nahin juta pate
 In any case, they have to fulfill the wishes of their uncles
 kai baar mulaayam bhi bich main aa jate hai or duusari partiyon se rajnatik sambandhon jaise gambhir maamalon se lekar choti-moti niyuktiyon tak main apana vito chalaa dete hai
 This is the reason why the Chief Minister has had to take a U-turn from many of his decisions
 isamen sapa sarkaar banane ke baad shaam saat baje ke baad mal ko bijli na dene or vidhayakon ko apni nidhi se mahangi car kharidne kii chhot dene jaise nirnay bhi shaamil the
 Mulayam Singh Yadav's intervention was also responsible for reversing these decisions of Akhilesh Yadav, which was born out of the ability to fill the ears of some big leaders of the party
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad bhi jab akhilesh yadav ne 36 darja praapt mantriyon kii laal batti chhini to ek baar phir mulaayam singh yadav sakriy hue or apane bete kii ichha ko darkinar kar or uske nirnay ko palatate hue kuch netaaon ko behaal kar diya
 "after the Chief Minister's decision in policy matters, all of us also await the green signal of Mulayam Singh Yadav
" iske baad hi file teji se daudti he
 "for all these reasons, after the 2012 assembly elections, those who had hoped that the young Chief Minister would show some new magic, can only feel disappointed
" tab yuva akhilesh ko sapa kii nai raajnneeti kaa pratik mana gaya tha
 He was especially hopeful of newness in the politics of Uttar Pradesh, but that dream seems far-fetched
 shiv nader vishvavidhyalay main samajashastri dipankar gupta kehete hai, ‘‘isamen do raay nahin ki akhilesh yadav ne kaaphi niraash kiya he
 He makes only a difference in age from his father
 kabhi nae uttar pradesh or nai samaajawaadee party ke liye nai ummid kii tarah dekhe gaye akhilesh lagata he ki apane bujurgon ke hi aks hai
 The simplest example of this is that after the Badaun rape case emerged in the headlines on May 27, it took Akhilesh six days to transfer Anil Kumar Gupta, Chief Secretary (home), the top law and order officer in the state, while local police officer Ganga Singh Yadav's transfer took eight days, which is probably the lowest rung officer in the police system
 ek varisht afasarshah kehete hai, ‘‘agar isse yah pataa nahin chalata ki uttar pradesh main kya chal rahaa he to or kaise bataaya ja saktaa he

 Last week, Union Minister and senior BJP leader Sanjay Paswan had said that sterilization will help in population control of the country
 unhone kaha tha ki desh main jansankhya niyantran ke liye samaaj ke har varg ke logon ko ise apnaanaa chahie
 Giriraj said that India's population is 16 percent of the total population of the world and it increases every year, equal to the population of Australia
 unhone kaha, "desh jansankhya visphot se jujh rahaa he, jise turant niyantrit karne kii jarurat he
 " is saal oktober maheene main giriraaj singh ne kaha tha ki hinduon ko adhik baccha paidaa kar desh main unki jansankhya badhaane par gambhirthapurvak vichaar karnaa chahie
 He then recalled that this statement was not from anyone else but the head of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Mohan Bhagwat, who advised Hindus to have more children in August last year

 He said, "the country is reeling from the population explosion, which needs to be controlled immediately

 inputah PTI The Indian Medical Association (IMA), through its program 'satyamev Jayate', has demanded an apology from Aamir Khan for sending a 'wrong message' to the medical community, but lyricist Javed Akhtar has denied the demand for IMA
 tippaniyan Akhtar even went on to say that the ima's decision to apologize to Aamir is wrong
 akhtar ne twitor par jari apane sandesh main likhaa he, ieme ne aamir se maafee kii maang kii he

 akhtar ne to yahaan tak kaha ki aamir se maafee maangane sambandhi ieme kaa faisla galat he
 In his message released on Twitter, Akhtar wrote, IMA has apologized to Aamir
 yah galat he
 Aamir is being asked to say so because he has exposed the mistakes of the medical field

 Expressing its reaction to this episode, the country's largest medical institution-ima has demanded an apology from Aamir
 akhtar ne is bare main likhaa he, aamir nahin, balki kuch laalchee, aniatik or bhrasht doctor is peshey or eemaandaar doctoron kii tauheen kar rahe hai
 After highlighting social evils like female feticide and dowry, Aamir in one episode of his program highlighted the misdeeds in the health profession

 aaj deshbhar main log hanuman jayanti kaa parv manaa rahe hai
 Hanuman, a devotee of Maryada Purushottam Shriram, is also known as Bajrangbali, Pawan Putra, Anjani Putra
 hindu dharm ke anusaar hanuman ji kii puja karne se vyakti ke saare sankat tal jate hai
 In this case, let us know what is Hanumanashtak and what is the story related to it
 sankatmochan hanumanashtak kii sanrachana goswami tulsidas ne kii thi
 It is believed that reciting Sankatmochan Hanumanashtak on Hanuman Jayanti relieves a person from all his obstacles and pains and all his troubles are removed
 sarvapidahar hanumanashtak kii rachana se pehle tulsibaba ko yun darshan die bajrang bali ne
 
 
 Goswami Tulsidas, the creator of Ramcharitmanas, had Ayodhya, Kashi and Chitrakoot
 tulsidas us samay main ramakatha kaa gungan kiya karte the
 Whom the devotees used to come to listen to with pride
 kaha jaataa he ki ramakatha sunne waalon main ek kodhi manushya ramarsik bhi vahaan rojaanaa katha sunne aata tha
 He would go quietly from there when he was in trouble
 ek din kaashi ke van main tulsidas ne ramastuti ke baad us kongrast ramakatha rasik kaa peechha karne kaa man banaaya
 After hearing the story, when everyone left from there, Tulsibaba, holding the person's feet, be reverently and urged them to see him in real form
 bhakthibhaav vasheebhoot shiv avatar anjanisut hanuman vahaan prakat ho gaye
 Tulsidas was blessed to see his presiding deity in front of him
 jiske baad unhone hanumanji kii prerana se kai amar rachanaaon ke saath hanumanashtak kii bhi rachana kii
 It is said that the place where Sankatmochan Hanuman Temple is built today at the place where Tulsidas ji had visions of Bajrangbali
 kaliyug hi nahin har yug main hanuman apane bhakton ke samast sankat harne vaale bhagwaan maane jate hai
 This is the reason why they are also called as troublemakers
 jyotishacharya pandit arunesh kumaar sharma ne bataaya ki jahaan hanumanji ne tulsidasji ko darshan die the, vahiin wo tulsibaba ke aagrah karne par pratimaroop main sthapit ho gaye
 Tulsi Baba composed Hanuman Ashtak to remove all the miseries of the devotees
 ashtapadiya yah stutipth hanumanji ko unki shaktiyon kaa bhaan karaata he
 Pleased with this, they take all the sufferings of the devotees
 baalpan main atintakhat hanuman samast shaktiyon ko prayog bal sulabh kridaaon main karte
 On this, the sage cursed them that until they were reminded of their powers, those powers would cease to be forgotten
 ramcharitmanas main bhi jamavant ne mahabali hanumanji ko usiki shaktiyaan yaad karwaai thim
 First verse of Hanumanashtak - In the first verse of Hanumanashtak, it is described to take the sun as a fruit and fill it in the mouth

 Then, i brought siya-sudhi Pran to meet Sita in Ashok Vatika in the post of Babarochethe and Shri Ram
 It is a description of making one free from grief by giving a ring

 Excerpts from the conversation with the Chief Minister: Opponents allege that you are indulging in Karnataka election campaign by ignoring the state and spend most of the time in Gorakhpur instead of Lucknow
 main samajhataa hum ki rajya kaa jitna daura maine kiya utana pichley 15 varshon ke dauraan satta main rahe teen mukhyamantriyon main se kisi ne nahin kiya hoga
 Even then, i was present in his office more time than him
 aap khud dekhie ki hamane kitni teji se pramukh yojanaon par kaam kiya he
 There was not a single house constructed under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana in the state from 2014 to 2017 whereas we gave 8 to the poor
 85 lakh ghar banaakar die
 Today, Uttar Pradesh is the number-1 state in the country in public housing scheme related demonstration
 pradhanmantri kii svachh bharat yojana ke tahat rajya main garibon ke liye chaar lakh shauchalay banaae gaye
 Electricity was provided to 56,000 families
 aazaadee ke itane saal baad bhi kareeb 32 lakh parivaar aise the jinke paas bijli conection nahin the, hamane unke gharon main bijli pahunchaai

 2 lakh kimi sadak ko hamane gaddhamukt kiya
 If your government was doing such a good job then why did the BJP lose in the Lok Sabha by-elections in Gorakhpur and Phulpur? The defeat of Gorakhpur is a lesson for us
 nishchit rup se iskaa kaaran party kaa ativishwaas rahaa
 Every worker was absolutely certain of victory
 lekin jab chunaav se thik pehle main gorakhpur pahunchaa to vahaan kii tasviir ekadam alag thi
 Unfortunately our candidate became ill at the same time
 sikh yahi he ki hamen hameshaa sajag rahanaa chahie
 Every election is a lesson for the future
 kya aap isse chintit nahin ki mahaj ek saal pehle vidhansabha chunaav main aapako jabardast janadesh mila, phir do hyprophile sansadeey siton ke upachunaav main haar gaye?upachunaavon ko kabhi bhi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par janamat sangrah kii tarah nahin dekha jaataa
 When the Samajwadi Party was in power in the state, it won most of the seats in the by-elections, but lost most of the seats in the assembly elections
 upachunaavon main sthaneey kaarak badi bhoomika nibhaate hai
 Shouldn't you have offered to resign after you lost the Gorakhpur by-election, as it was seen as a no-confidence motion against you? jaisaa maine abhi-abhi kaha ki upachunaav or sarkaar par vishwaas main paraspar koi sambandh nahin
 By-elections are fought on the basis of local issues and caste equations and if you live in extreme belief then these factors can be very fatal
 bataur mukhyamantri aapaki praathamikta main koun se kshetra rahe?meri praathamikta yah thi ki jati or parivaarwaad kii raajnneeti main pade rajya kii chhavi ko sudhara jaae
 Uttar Pradesh was crippled by corruption and the law and order situation in the state was in a bad shape
 hamane rajya ke maahaul ko badla or aisi prashasan vyavastha banaai jo khaas logon or jatiyon kii bajaae aam logon kii jaruraton par kendrit thi
 Now the government is working for farmers, youth, women and backward people
 debiti (diarect benefit transfar) ke tahat kisaanon ke bank khaaton main 80,000 karod ru
 Amount exceeded
 2012-13 se lekar 2017-18 ke bich ganna kisaanon kaa kareeb 25,000 karod ru
 Our government paid the dues of Rs
 18,000 crores in this financial year
 kii sahaayta raashi di gai
 In 1994, the earlier government declared about 250 development blocks as "dark zones"
 in kshetron ke kisaanon ko tubewel ke liye bijli nahin milti thi, isliye unhen dijal se tubewel chalaanaa padataa tha
 We investigated these development blocks and freed them from the "dark zone" and made tubewells available to farmers and today they are able to pay electricity bills
 kareeb 20,000 kisaanon ko solar pump uplabdh karaayaa gaya
 Eight irrigation projects were pending for years
 hamane 31 march tak unamem se chah ko shuru kiya or inamen se do bahut jald puri hone vaali hai
 During the rule of the previous government, only four districts of the state used to get full electricity, while 71 districts got around 2-3 hours
 aaj hamaari sarkaar gramin kshetron main bhi 18 ghante bijli de rahi he
 Due to loan waiver of farmers, the state budget was heavily burdened and no money was left for other projects
 rajya lagbhag tut chukaa he
 When we came to power, the state treasury was empty
 pradesh kii sthiti badahaal thi
 We are wholeheartedly trying to fix the situation
 kisaanon kii karj maafee kii baat ho yaa phir anya nai yojanaon ko shuru karne kii, hamane ye sara kaam rajya ke kosh se hi kiya
 We did not take any money from the central government or banks nor issued any kind of bond for loan waiver
 hamane sabase pehle anaavashyak kharchon par ankush lagaaya or sarkari yojanaon main paise ke durupyog ke raste band kiye
 The verification of the ration card revealed that about 30 lakh ration cards were fake
 hamane vidyutikaran, peyajal, sinchai, gramin kalyaan vagairah se judi rajya kai yojanaon par amal behatar kiya
 There is no doubt that the financial situation of the state is still challenging, but i am happy that we are working within the limits of FRBM (financial Responsibility and Budget Management) Act
 hamane un sabhi kharchon ko roak diya jinhen taala ja saktaa tha or is baat kii puri koshish kii ki rajya ke khajaane kaa ek-ek paisa rajya ke hiton main hi kharch ho
 Uttar Pradesh is still a backward state from an industrial point of view
 nivesh kaa maahaul sudhaarney ke liye aapane kya kiya he?nivesh ke liye sabase jaruri he ki pradesh main kanoon-vyavastha behatar ho, jisase log bekhauf hokar kaarobaar kar saken or prashasnic makadzaal main unki filein na ataken
 i am happy that we have succeeded in creating a smooth process of administrative approval for the investors and creating a suitable business environment in the state
 aaj niveshak uttar pradesh main badale hue vaataavaran ko mahasoos kar rahaa he or ise anya kshetron ke mukaable sarvaadhik pratispardhi rajya ke rup main dekh rahaa he
 i am not saying this because i am the Chief Minister of this place, but rather it is the belief of the investors who attended the investor conference of February 21-22
 unka kahana he ki ab yahaan niveshkon ke liye anukool maahaul he or isi kaa parinaam he ki is sammelan main rajya main 4
 68 lakh crores
 ke nivesh ke emoyu par hastakshar kiye gaye
 i am happy that we will spend Rs 35,000 crore this month
 kii pariyojnaayen shuru karne ja rahe hai
 But many challenges still have to be faced
 pichley ayogy prashasan ke kaaran zyaadaatar vikaas yojanaayen vivaadon main fansi hai
 We found that banks and financial institutions also shy away from working with the government
 aaj na keval vanijyik bank balki duniya kaa har vittiya santhaan uttar pradesh kii pariyojnaon main paisa lagaana chahta he
 There is a deep disparity between eastern and western Uttar Pradesh in terms of development
 is disha main aap kya kar rahe hai?is asamanta ke kai kaaran hai
 Our government has prepared uniform development plans for every area of the state
 iske atirikt hamaare lagbhag har jile main paaramparik udyog kaa khajaana he
 For example, brass work in Moradabad, iron in Aligarh, glass in Firozabad and crockery in Khurja
 hamane 68 varshon ke baad is saal 24 janvari ko rajya kaa sthapana diwas manaaya
 On this occasion, "one district, one product" scheme was launched
 akhilesh yadav sarkaar ne lakhanu-agra expresve banwaaya
 What infrastructure projects are you working on? We are working on two new expressways in Uttar Pradesh - one that will connect Purvanchal to Lucknow via Ballia, Ghazipur and Banaras and the other one is Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Chitrakoot And will connect with Allahabad
 hamane teen nae shaharon main metro train seva shuru karne ke liye vistrut pariyojna report (deepiar) centre sarkaar ko bhej di he or manjuuri milte hi is par kaam shuru kar denge
 We are also working on two new international airports
 kushinagar main kaam shuru ho chukaa he jabaki jevar hawaii adde par jald hi kaam shuru hone kii ummid he
 After connecting all roads in the state, the work of connecting all the district headquarters with a four-lane road network will be started
 isiilie main kah rahaa hum ki uttar pradesh apaar sambhaavnaaon kaa rajya he
 We have fertilizer land and vast water resources

 Therefore, Uttar Pradesh will not be left behind
 logon ko rojgaar mili, iske liye kya kar rahe hai?pehle sarkari niyuktiyon ke liye jamkar paise liye jate the
 Whether it is about the Public Service Commission or education or police
 adaalat ko is prakriya ko rokane ke liye hastkshep karnaa padaa
 We have made new rules and made the entire appointment system transparent
 3,000 sab inspector or 35,000 consteble kii bhartee prakriya puri ho chuki he
 There are around four lakh government jobs in various departments in total
 pradhanmantri kaushal vikaas yojana ke antargat hamane chah lakh yuvaaon kaa namakan kiya jinamein 4
 5 lakhs have passed
 do lakh logon kii vibhinn udyogon or pratishthanon main naukari lag chuki he
 You have talked about better law and order
 phir bhi rajya police par kathith aparaadhiyon ke saath farji encounter karne kaa aarope he
 Encounter has no place in government policy
 rajya ke harek naagarik kii suraksha sarkaar kaa daayitv he
 If a criminal shoots at the police, the police can also retaliate for self-defense
 uttar pradesh main jatigat takaraav bad rahe hai, haal kaa dalit virodh is baat kaa udhaaharan he
 What is your government doing? There has never been a clash between upper castes and scheduled castes in Uttar Pradesh
 rajya main 75 jile hai jinamein sirf 3-4 jilon main hi bharat band ke dauraan aagjanee kii kuch ghatnaayen huin, par unke peeche jatigat takaraav jaisaa kuch nahin tha
 The names of those who were plotting in the name of Dalits have also come out and we have also taken effective action against them
 dalit itane aakraamak kyon ho rahe hai?yah maamla dalit virodh kaa nahin, balki ek siyaasi shatranj he jiske peeche daliton ko mohara banaakar log apana swaarth siddh kar rahe hai
 This is a sponsored drama
 daliton ke hit ke liye sabase zyada kaam bhartiya janata party ne kiya he
 You have added "ramji" with the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar, is it symbolic? Our government has not done so
 uttar pradesh sarkaar ke paas do prastaav aae the, ek mananeey rajyapal kii ore se tha jisamen kaha gaya ki unka naam "ambedkar'' nahin, balki "ambedkar'' he or doosraa ambedkar mahasabha se, jisamen yah nivedan kiya gaya tha ki samvidhan kii mul prati main baba sahib ne apane hastakshar main "bhimrao raamji ambedkar'' likhaa he, isliye unka naam vaise hi likhaa janaa chahie
 i have ordered necessary changes in this regard, including the installation of a picture of Babasaheb in all the offices of the state
 anusuchit jati-janajati utpeeda nirodhak adhinium par supreme court ke faisle par daliton kaa rosh sahi he?loktantr main sabhi ko abhivyakti kii aazaadee he
 Those who have violent demonstrations in the name of Dalits, their intentions will be exposed and their faces will definitely be exposed
 doosraa, supreme court ne koi nayaa aadesh nahin diya he, 11 saal pehle mayawati kii sarkaar ne lagbhag aisa hi aadesh jari kiya tha
 However, the Central Government has assured to file a review petition in the Supreme Court on this subject
 aapako nahin lagata ki vikaas ke agenda par hindutv baari pad rahaa he?hindutv or vikaas alag-alag nahin, balki ek-duusare ke poorak hai or donon hi bhartiya jivan kaa aadhaar hai
 Why do you see it associated with religion
 aap ise sampradayikta se jodakar kyon dekhte hai
 Hindutva philosophy says "sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah, Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam" with everyone or everyone's development
 yahi bhartiya darshan he
 We are proud that Uttar Pradesh is considered the best tourist destination in the world where cities like Ayodhya, Mathura, Kashi, Prayagraj, rivers like Ganga, Yamuna and many Shaktipeeths are present
 hamaare yahaan ikoturism or heritage tourism kii apaar sambhaavnaaen maujuud hai
 My government will definitely try to push them forward
 aapane vidhansabha main kaha ki aap id nahin manaayenge, kya ek mukhyamantri ke taur par yah kahana thik he?har vyakti ko apana dharm maanane kii aazaadee he
 i cannot do this but recite Hanuman Chalisa inside the house and pretend to put hat outside to woo the vote bank
 yah meraa daayitv he ki main apni pahchaan khoe bagaiyr ek shantipurna maahaul viksit karun jahaan har samudaay ke log apane dharm or apane tyohaar manaa saken
 My government has been successful in doing so in the tenure of a year
 bhaajapa musalamaanon kaa bharosa jeetne main safal kyon nahin ho saki?har naagarik ko samvidhan pradutt adhikaar ke prayog kii swatantraaa he
 i implemented various schemes of good governance without any discrimination on my part
 ab yah to janata par nirbhar karata he ki vah "vikaas'' ko chune yaa phir "vinaash'' ko
 Did you change your perspective on "love Jihad" after becoming the Chief Minister? After taking over Uttar Pradesh, we worked to ensure women's safety and started a 1090 helpline for the same purpose
 gharelu hinsa par rokthaam ke liye helpline number he 181
 We formed the anti-romeo Squad
 mahilaon kii suraksha ke liye ham patibaddh hai or shlavy ke naam par kisi bhi asaamaajik yaa rashtravirohi takat ko uttar pradesh kii dharti par phalne-phoolne nahin denge

 Book Name: Talaash Bhojpuri Linguistic Identity Writer: Ajit Dubeprakash: Indica Infomedia Price: Rs 400 On 17 May 2012, the then Home Minister p Chidambaram said in Parliament, 'we understand the spirit of Raua Sab'
 tamil bhashi or hai class kii angreji bolne vaale chidambaram ke munh se bhojpuri ke ye chand shabd sunakar samoochaa desh hairaan rah gaya tha
 In fact, Chidambaram had assured that the bill would be introduced in the forthcoming session of Parliament on the calling attention motion brought in the 15th Lok Sabha regarding the inclusion of Bhojpuri language in the Eighth Schedule
 lekin ab 16veen loksabhaa kaa sheetakaaleen satr chal rahaa he or is bill kaa koi ata-pataa tak nahin he
 Bhojpuri society president Ajit Dubey's book 'talaash Bhojpuri linguistic identity' focuses on the efforts made in the country and abroad for the constitutional recognition of Bhojpuri
 bhojpuri bhashaa-asmita kii ladaai ke 'sipaahi' dube ne apni is kitaab main angrejimukhi ho chuke satta pratishthan se sangharsh kaa byoraa pesh kiya he
 That is, it is a very special book in all the work that has been done in the direction of providing constitutional recognition to Bhojpuri
 is kitaab main na keval ab tak hue sampurna bhojpuri bhashaa kii ladaai kaa itihaas mil jayega balki usase judi samasyaon kaa lekha-jokha bhi milegaa
 The Bhojpuri language spoken by more than 200 million people in 16 countries around the world, covering nearly a thousand years of history, is still looking forward to gaining constitutional recognition
 yah kitaab bhojpuri bhashaa, sahitya, samaaj, samskruti or parampara kii prishthbhumi main is bhashaa ko sanvaidhanik darja dilavaanon ke liye hue or ho rahe sangharshon kaa lekha-jokha pesh karti he
 Apart from social efforts in this area, the book also suggests efforts made in Parliament, blank assurances from the government, bottlenecks in the path of constitutional recognition and measures to address these obstacles
 kisi bhashaa ke aathvin anusuchee main shaamil hone kaa matlab kya he? aisa hone se us bhashaa ko kya phaayde hote hai? sarkaar ne agar aaj tak 22 bhartiya bhashaaon ko 8veen anusuchee main shaamil kiya to bhojpuri ko yah sammaan dene main sarkaar hichkicha kyon rahi he? is mudde par sarkaar kii taraf se kya pahal kii gai he? ye aise tamaam sawaal hai jo ek bhojpuria maati ke laal ke man main uthte hai
 The answers to all these questions are given in this book
 maithili, bodo, konkani, dogri jaisi tamaam bhashaaon samvidhan kii aathvin anusuchee main shaamil kiya gaya he lekin yah jaankaar aapako hairaani ho sakati he ki in bhashaaon ko bolne vaale log keval lakhon kii taadaad main hai jabaki bhojpuri bhashaa inase zyada bade paimaane par boli jaati he
 Some of our mps have consistently raised the voice in Parliament to give Bhojpuri a place in the Constitution, which has raised awareness on this matter and the issue remains alive
 lekin afsos kii baat yah he ki unki tamaam koshishen bhojpuri ko isse zyada kuch nahin de pain or ise iske anjaam tak nahin pahunchaa pai
 This book by Ajit Dubey is a document of the long fight for the linguistic identity of Bhojpuri-linguists
 kitaab main bhojpuri bhashaa, sahitya, samskruti, cinema kii aitihaasik prishthbhumi par bhi prakaash daalaa gaya he
 Each article of this book is strapped on the head of the imperialists of the language and its words are like a flower falling from the head of a folk god
 haalanki, bhojpuri kii baat karne vaali yah kitaab hindi main likhi hui he
 According to me, if this book were written in Bhojpuri, then perhaps there would have been better justice with this language

 'sahitya ajtak 2019 ' aaj (shuukravaar) se shuru ho gaya1 november se 3 november tak chalegaa sahitya kaa mahakumbhsahitya ajtak main shaamil hongi kai mashhoor hastiyaansahitya kaa sabase bada mahakumbh 'sahitya ajtak 2019 ' aaj (shuukravaar) se shuru ho gaya he
 Writer and journalist Vijay Trivedi along with writer and journalist Ashutosh, writer and journalist Saba Naqvi participated in the 'rashtra or Hindu Rashtra' session on the 'sidhi Baat' stage of 'sahitya Aaj Tak' on the first day
 is dauraan teenon varisht patrakaron ne apni baaten bebaaki se rakhin
 The session was conducted by Aaj Tak's Executive Editor Rohit Sardana
 charchaa kii shuruyaat main teenon hi mehmaanon kii kitabon kaa bhi zikr kiya gaya
 Starting the discussion, Rohit said that there is no religion of the country but despite that we are two to four whether India is a Hindu nation
 charchaa main sabase pehle ashutosh ne kaha hindu raashtra apane aap main ek project he
 And it starts from 1925
 meraa kahana he ki bharat sirf hinduon kaa desh nahin he
 The Hindu nation is a religious entity
 agar aap yah kahen ki yahaan rahane vaala har shaks hindu he to hamen aapatti he
 No one can change one's religion by greed
 koi jabardastee kisi par apana dharm thope nahin saktaa he
 In that sense, it is a myth that India is a Hindu nation
 hindu raashtra ko lekar kanfusion he: vijay trivedivijay trivedi ne charchaa ko aage badhaate hue kaha, hindu raashtra ko lekar kanfusion he
 Savarkar was the first to give the concept of Hindu Rashtra
 saavarkar ke concept ko sangh nahin maanata he
 What Ashutosh is saying is Savarkar's Hindu Rashtra
 golwalkar ne kaha he hindustan main jo rahata he vah log hindu hai
 The current Sarsanghchalak has recently clarified that Hinduism is incomplete without Muslims
 isliye main kahana chahta hum ki kanfusion zyada he
 India is a secular nation: Saba Naqvi After this Saba Naqvi made his point saying that India is constitutionally a secular nation
 sangh ne kaha he ham sab hindu hai
 But whatever people say that there cannot be a Hindu nation without Muslims, but what is happening in India today is against Muslims
 kashmir main dhara 370 hati, assam main enarasi laayaa gaya kyonki vah muslim bahulya rajya the
 The BJP should not be insured but it talks daily that Muslims have special status
 aaj hi ek angreji akhbaar main chapa hua he ki musalmaan aaj dalit or adivaasiyon se bhi garib ho gaya he
 i do not want to talk to Muslims separately but today if you look at the nation from the perspective of minorities, they feel that the Hindu nation has arrived, they will neither get respect, will be questioned on their citizenship and hated by putting their photos Will look through the eyes
 dharm kisi mulk kaa aadhaar nahin ban saktaa: sabaa naqviiske baad rohit sardana ne kaha ki sabaa kii baat par jaaen to iskaa matlab he ki hindu raashtra to 15 agast 1947 ko hi aa gaya tha
 Two nations were divided on the basis of religion
 ek dharm ke maanane vaale idhar aa gaye jabaki duusare vaale udhar chale gaye
 Saba Naqvi hit out at Rohit, saying Pakistan was built on religious grounds
 Pakistan means whoever is not a Muslim is evil
 pakistan ke log bengali musalmaan ke saath nahin rah paae
 In Pakistan, there are quarrels between Punjabi Sindhis
 dharm kisi mulk kaa aadhaar nahin ban saktaa
 If you are saying this then you are making India smaller

 Ashutosh said that i am theoretically against the fact that people in the government should be publicly part of any religious event
 pandit nehru ne galati kii to uske liye main jimmedaar nahin hum
 Gandhiji has given a definition of what is Hindu
 gandhi ji se poocha gaya tha ki kya apane aapako hindu maanate hai to unhone kaha tha haa main apane aap ko hindu maanata hum
 Because i believe in the Sanatan Veda
 gandhi ji kaa jo hindootv he usamen dayaa he, karunaa he, mamata he
 Savarkar writes in his book that those who talk of mercy, compassion, compassion weaken the Hindu
 unhone kaayar shabd kaa istemaal kiya
 According to Savarkar, Hindu Rashtra means where only Hinduism is concerned
 baaki dharm ke log dwitiya naagarik ke taur par hai
 In Deendayal's Integral Humanism, it is also said that we cannot expel 7 crore Muslims outside the country
 lekin agar ve yahaan rahanaa chaahate hai to ham unke bare main soch sakate hai
 If this is the definition of our Hindu nation, then we do not want such a Hindu nation
 or log aisa hi hindu raashtra banane kii koshish kar rahe hai pichley dinon main
 Vijay Trivedi said that there is a big change in the mind set
 sanvaidhanik taur par dekhen to koi yahaan pruthak nahin he musalmaan or hindu donon ek saath vot dete hai lekin jo hamaara mindset he, jab is desh kii koi badi sarkaar bina kisi muslim mishan ke chalati ho jab koi ek bade rajya main vahaan kii sabase badi party kisi ko apana muslim numaayinda nahin maanati ho, to ye sab bade sawaal khadey karte hai
 But Hindus are different from this
 hindustan kaa jo hindustani he vah aaj bhi sahishnu he
 He still trusts in Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam
 aaj yadi aisa nahin hota to yahaan dange ho rahe hote
 If riots are not happening today, there is no government or political party, it is Hindutva
 jo gandhi kaa zikr kar rahe hai wo gandhi kaa hindutv hi hamaare zyaadaatar log maanate hai
 Swami Vivekananda's Hindutva, the Supreme Court's Hindutva and the existing political system's Hindutva are causing confusion in you and that is bothering us
 hindustan ke sabase kharaab pradhanmantri the rajeev gandhi: sabaa naqvisba ne bich charchaa kaha ki hindustan main tamaam dikkatein raheen main maanati hum ki hindustan ke jo sabase kharaab pradhanmantri rahe, wo the rajeev gandhi
 In his era, Shah Bano Judgment was overturned
 unke jamaane main muslim personal lau board, unke jamaane main babari masjid ke taale khol die gaye
 He thought that a little Muslim appointment, because he was clumsy
 wo ek payalat the
 His mother immediately passed away and he came to the Prime Minister's seat
 jo historical folt line unhone khole uske baad hindustan kaa puraa diarection hi badal gaya
 In Hindu Hindu issues, which he put his hand, one Muslim woman bill which overturned Shah Bano Judgment and which sparked the issue of Ram Janmabhoomi
 uske alaava bahut sari chijen jaise bhopal gas tragedy us time hui, union carbide ke log nikal gaye
 Sent our army to Sri Lanka
 unhone kai sari galtiyaan kin
 Clumsy has been Prime Minister
 congress kii bahut galtiyaan rahi hai
 He did nothing for the Muslims
 kuch logon ko hi power diya
 But he did not produce Hate in Hindu Muslim
 dange isliye nahin hote ki hindu muslim saath main kaam karte hai
 People everywhere are working together
 aligarh jaaie, banaras jaaie har jagah log saath kaam kar rahe hai
 Hindutva is an ideology Hindu is a religion: Ashutosh Ashutosh said Hinduism is an ideology Hindu is a religion
 jameen par vahi vichaardhaara chal rahi he
 Dayanand Saraswati said that there is only and only Veda
 vivekananda ne kaha hindu mind muslim body
 Aurobindo said that both have to live together
 yahi vichaardhaara he
 Rohit said there is a difference between Hinduism and Hinduism
 vijay trivedi ne kaha ki ham sangh virodh ko hi hindu virodh maanate hai
 The number of volunteers in the Sangh is around one crore, the population of this country is 130 crores, if Hindus believe it, then it is more than 80 crores
 80 karod main sirf 1 karod swayamsevak hai or ham sangh virodh ko hi hindu virodh maan rahe hai
 Therefore, we are also giving strength to the Sangh and humiliating the Hindus because if there were 80 crores Hindus, there would have been 80 crores volunteers
 12-15 karod logon ne bijepi ko vot kiya hoga wo sabalog sangh ke log nahin hai, usamen se bahut saare log hindu bhi nahin hai isliye sangh virodh ko hindu virodh maananaa is kanfusion ko dur karnaa padegaa
 Sangh which is Hindu ideology, but Hindu ideology is not the ideology of Sangh, unless we clear it, then this dispute will continue every day, we will continue to debate it

 In the end, Saba said that India is a big country, India has given big thought to the world
 ab ham aise daur se guzar rahe hai ki loktantr main sabase kamjor vyakti ko mahasoos hona chahie ki vah surakshit he lekin aajkal dalit, adivasee or alpsankhyak jo bhi ho chaahe sarkaar majboot ho, aresas majboot ho jab tak dayaa or prem ke saath ye kamjor hindustaniyon kii baat nahin karte hai or sirf nafrat kii bhaavana se dekhte hai to hamaari jo jarney he wo ruk jaaegi
 In the end, Ashutosh said that when Gandhiji was asked what is your religion, he said that the best among all religions is my religion when he had earlier said that i am a Hindu

 The Congress, which has managed to manage social media during the next Lok Sabha elections, has changed its Twitter account
 ab tak twitor par congress kaa aadhikarik acount @aicctweets naam ke handle se aata tha
 But today with this handle, followers were told that our new account has come on Twitter in the name of @incindia
 magar ye sirf naam kaa badlaav nahin he
 The appearance of both twitter accounts has also changed
 jahaan pehle vaala twitor acount aazaadee ke dashakon pehle congress ke shuruaati dinon ke adhiveshan kii tasviir dikhaata tha, vahiin nae acount kaa home pej sonia gandhi, rahul gandhi or manmohan singh kii shakl dikhaata he
 Apart from this, some pictures indicating development are also seen
 haalanki sonia gandhi kii tasviir do baar kyon istemaal kii gai, yah samaj nahin aata
 This new account was launched on Saturday 3 August and its first tweet was about Sonia Gandhi
 isamen bataaya gaya ki shrimati gandhi ne durga shakti nagpal ke masale par pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko chitthee likhi
 If we talk about the figures, the followers of this account have not reached even a thousand
 yah acount sirf 30 logon ko follow kar rahaa he, jinamein piemo samet zyaadaatar congressi saansad, pravaktaa or kuch sarkari vibhaag hai
 However, the previous account also could not do anything special in terms of data
 uske bhi abhi tak mahaj 2000 foloar ban paae the
 It is possible that under the new strategy, the Congress should post the party related news continuously with a new Twitter account and this will increase the number of followers

 ' The President's address was discussed on Tuesday amid heavy uproar in the Lok Sabha
 charchaa kii shuruyaat bijepi saansad hukumdev narayan yadav ne kii or unki ore se dhanyavad prastaav bhi pesh kiya gaya
 Hukumdev, while addressing the House, said that the 2019 Lok Sabha election will be the 'mahabharata of Democracy', where the contest is between the robber and the camaraderie
 unhone kaha ki modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal main garibon kii jindagi main ujaalaa aane aayaa he or aagaamee chunaav main ek taraf dharm or duusari taraf adharm kii sena hogi, ek taraf jhopadi, duusari taraf mahal hoga or pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saath khadaa garib is chunaav main unki jeet sunishchit karegaa
 Hukum Dev Narayan Yadav said that just as Mahabharata was held in the field of Kurukshetra earlier, similarly the election of this time will also be Mahabharata of democracy
 yadav ne kaha ki garib, jhopadi, dharm kaa pratinidhitiv narendra modi kar rahe hai or aise main garib unke saath khadey honge or phir se centre main hamaari sarkaar banegi
 He said that the President had mentioned Mahatma Gandhi, Bhimrao Ambedkar and Ram Manohar Lohia in his address and the Modi government is working on the principles of these three great men
 modi ko hataane main lage luteremodi sarkaar kii tamaam yojanaon kaa zikr karte hue yadav ne kaha ki jandhan yojana ke tahat garibon ke khate khole gaye to shauchalayon ke nirmaan ke jariye aarthik barabari sunishchit karne kaa kaam kiya gaya he
 He said that the Modi government took action against those who steal and loot and now these people have united to remove Narendra Modi
 unhone saamaajik nyaay kaa zikr karte hue aarthik rup se garib logon ko 10 fisadi aarakshan dene ke faisle kaa swaagat kiya
 Watch full speech here: Hukumdev Narayan Yadav while referring to the budget proposal of giving six thousand to the farmers every year, said that the farmers of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and many backward states of the country will be greatly benefited by this scheme
 unhone kaha ki dilli-ensiaar ke kisaanon ne nahin, iske laabh ke bare main sudur kshetra ke garib kisaan bataa paaenge, unhen faisle se badi khushi mili he
 Targeting the brokers and middlemen upset opposition leaders, Yadav said that the money will go directly to the farmers' account and in such a situation, middlemen and brokers will not get anything, that is why they are upset, then they are standing against Modi
 isi dauraan unki tippanee ko lekar vipaksh ke sadasyon khaskar sapa ke dharmendra yadav ne gahari aapatti darj kii
 After this, the proceedings had to be postponed for about 10 minutes
 spikar ne dharmendra yadav se kaha ki agar kuch galat kaha hoga to use kaarywahi se hataaya jayega
 Amid shouting slogans by Congress and Trinamool Congress members, Yadav said, 'the poor of the country will stand with Narendra Modi in the next election and will again ensure bjp's victory
 ' haal hi main yadav ko bhi padmabhushan se sammanit karne kii ghoshnaa kii gai thi
 He said that by honoring him and some people of rural background, this government has honored the poor and backward
 pehle sirf ghotaalon kii charchadhanyavad prastaav kaa samarthan karte hue bijepi saansad jagdambika paal ne kaha ki pehali baar aisa hua he ki vipaksh ke paas sarkaar ke khilaaf bolne ke liye koi mudda nahin he
 Without naming Congress President Rahul Gandhi, he said that under the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana, there has been talk of giving six thousand rupees a year to farmers, then an honorable member said that farmers have been insulted by giving Rs 17 per day
 main poochna chahta hum ki 10 saal kii sarkaar main aap logon ne kisaanon ke liye kya kiya? unhone ne kaha ki 2014 se pehle ghotaalon kii charchaa ho rahi he to ab 2019 main ayushmaan bharat, ujjwala or duusari yojanaon kii charchaa ho rahi he
 The Congress and TMC were in favor of holding a vote of thanks on Wednesday and that is why mps from both parties did not discuss it

 shivpal yadav ne naam liye bina ramgopal yadav or akhilesh yadav par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Shivpal Yadav said that some people are sacrificing the interest of the party for personal selfishness
 unhone kaha ki jaan boojhkar samaajawaadee party ke duusare dalon se vilay or gathbandhan par rhode atkaaye gaye
 Shivpal Yadav said that if Bihar had formed a grand alliance at the time of elections, then Mulayam Singh's stature would have been different
 shivpal yaheen nahin ruke or kaha ki party ke bheetar bhi shadyantr karne vaale log baithe hai or unase saavdhaan rahane kii zarurat he

 unhone kaha ki aisi shikaayatein jab kisi bhi prashasnic kaamkaaj main saamaanya rup se kii jaati hai to unhen upyukt samiti main bheja jaataa he

 Political strategist Prashant Kishore, who played a key role in the victory of the jdu-rjd-congress alliance in the recently concluded Bihar elections, will now take over the reins of the Congress in the UP elections
 buudhvaar ko nai dilli main upi chunaavon ko lekar congress kii baithak main prashanth kishor bhi shaamil hue the
 Prior to Bihar elections, Prashant Kishore has also played a key role in bjp's victory in 2014 general election
 buudhvaar ko uttar pradesh ke congress netaaon ne baithak main kishor kii maujuudagi kii pushti kii
 According to party leaders, with the expertise of Prashant Kishore, the Congress will defeat BJP, SP and BSP in the 2017 elections
 uttar pradesh congress ke pramukh nirmal khatri ne bataaya ki rahul kii bahan priyanka ko chunaav main party kaa cheharaa banaae jane par koi charchaa nahin hui or mukhyarup se rajya ke samasyagrast muddon ke ird-gird charchaa hui
 National Vice President of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) Shivanand Tiwari considers Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar as the biggest face of the country against Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha ki desh kii jo haalat he or jo centre main sarkaar he wo jis tareeke se kaam kar rahi he usase desh ko khatra he
 In such a situation, a leader like Nitish Kumar should come forward and play an important role in national politics
 andekhi kii to maaf nahin karegaa deshtiwari ne kaha ki aaj jo vipaksh chup he, use sawaal poochne vaala mil jayega
 Shivanand Tiwari also said that Nitish Kumar can be the only option for Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha ki agar aise samay kii wo andekhi karte hai to itihaas unhen kabhi maaf nahin karegaa
 The Mahagathbandhan has completely disintegrated in Bihar, mainly because of the headlessness in the RJD
 loksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar ke baad se party ke netaa tejasvi yadav agyatavaas main chale gaye or ek-do baar saamne bhi aae to netaa vipaksh kii bhoomika main kahin se najar nahin aae
 Nitish was invited to come to the NDA
 Recently, two meetings of the RJD Legislature Party and leaders were called but he did not come and later one meeting had to be canceled
 aise main puri party main udaasi kaa bhav he, vidhayakon ko samaj main nahin aa rahaa ki wo kiske netritv main chunaav ladenge
 In such a situation, senior party leaders are seeing the future of the party in the dark
 party ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh shivanand tiwari ne mahagathbandhan ke netritv ke liye nitish kumaar ko endie chhodkar mahagathbandhan main aane kaa nyotaa diya
 He said that the way the government is running in the country will divide the country
 aise main nitish kumaar ek aise netaa hai, jo endie main rahane ke baavjood dharmanirpeksh cheharaa hai
 Inviting him to come to NDA, he said that he should come here, this is the need of the hour
 shivanand tiwari ne kaha ki desh ke andar jo shoonyata kii sthiti bani hui he, is sthiti main ek vyavhaarik kism kaa gathbandhan hoga
 It may have a role at the national level
 mahagathbandhan main foot ke baad party ko nitish se asbihar main congress alag chunaav ladane kaa man bana chuki he, to mahagathbandhan main shaamil jeethanram maanjhi ne agal chunaav ladane kaa elaan bhi kar diya he
 In such a situation, the Grand Alliance has completely disintegrated
 mahagathbandhan ne 2019 kaa chunaav tejasvi yadav ke netritv main ladaa tha lekin wo isamen puri tarah se naakaam rahe, ab yahaan sabase bada sankat netritv kaa he
 The 2015 assembly mahagathbandhan fought under the leadership of Nitish Kumar, when RJD reached 80 seats from 22 seats in 2010, but what will happen this time
 tejasvi apane vidhayakon se baat nahin karte or lalu yadav ke jail se nikalne kii koi ummid philhal nahin dikhaai de rahi he
 In such a situation, what to do if we have a party, so they see a hope in Natish Kumar
 shivanand tiwari ne nitish kumaar kii prashansa karte hue kaha ki unke jo gun hai, uske aadhaar par rashtriya raajnneeti main mahatvapurn bhoomika adaa kar sakate hai

 But if you lose in this referendum within two years of winning 67 out of 70 seats, then morality demands that you get the confidence of the public again according to the principle of EVM 'recall'
 ' Yadav has written in his letter, 'the historical mandate that Delhi gave two years ago was not the charisma of any single leader or party
 uske peeche hajaaron volantiaron kaa tyaag or tapasya thi
 But the biggest reason for this charism was the self-confidence of the people of Delhi
 janalokapal andolan ne dilli ke lakhon nagarikon ko yah bharosa dilaayaa ki wo bechaare nahin hai
 They are more powerful than leaders, parties and governments
 aaj main us aatmbal ko dagamagaate hue dekh rahaa hum
 So for the first time in the last two years i am communicating with you and reminding you of the promise of a recall at Ramlila Maidan
 ' Yadav has also said that while throwing water on the AAP survey, many of the AAP voters who gave a historic majority in 2015 are going towards the BJP
 apane is patr main yadav ne emsidi main vartmaan main satta kaa sukh le rahi bijepi ko 'nikammi or bhrasht' sarkaar qaraar diya he
 Yadav wrote, 'I have been thinking since last month who is responsible for giving the BJP which runs this inefficient and corrupt government a chance to stand in the MCD election
 ' unhone likhaa, 'dilli kii is durghatana ke liye vyaktigat rup se aap jimmedaar hai
 You have broken the trust of the people of Delhi
 ' In his letter, Yadav reminded Kejriwal of the garbage and filth spread in Delhi

 ' sibies sho madam secretary sijan paanch ke pehle episod ko amejon prime india ne hataa liya he
 It is believed that this episode has been removed due to a controversial reference regarding Hindu extremist ideology

 But the rest of the episodes of this show can be seen
 madam secretary ek american political drama he jo ek kaalpanik kirdaar secretary of state elizabeth meccord par aadhaarit he
 It can be seen in this episode that mccord tries to get nuclear documents signed between India and Pakistan
 is episod main kai dialogs aise hai jo kaaphi vivaadit hai
 For example, Elizabeth mccord gives a staff member a brief on the current state of India
 iske anusaar, bharat kii sarkaar hindu charampanthiyon kaa saath de rahi he or alpsankhyakon par ho rahe hinsak hamalon par koi ection nahin le rahi he
 In this episode, mccord's husband Professor Henry mccord can be seen debating with an Indian professor further

 The reference to Kashmir was also taken at one time in the show

 bijepi se istipha dekar chunaav ke bich congress main shaamil hue purv cricketer navjot singh siddhu ko congress jhatka de sakati he
 Sidhu wants to become deputy CM in the Amarinder Singh government, which came to power with a landslide victory, but Amarinder Singh is not at all persuaded
 agar unki chali to siddhu ko jhatka mil saktaa he
 Captain has given speculation about the reasoning that he may be the deputy CM in the Congress government of Punjab
 lekin sutron se mil rahi jaankaree ke mutabik captain amarinder singh apane mantrimandal main dipti siem kaa pad nahin chaahate
 Captain Amarinder Singh argues that the post of deputy CM is given when the party does not have a majority and has to give respect to a leader in the coalition or some other compulsion but in Punjab the Congress has won by a huge majority and in this way The post of deputy CM is not required
 darasal sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabicocaptain amarinder sinhanheen chaahate ki punjab sarkaar main unke samanaantar kisi ko khadaa kiya jaae, isi vajah se wo congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi or alaakaman ko is baat ko manwaane main kaaphi had tak kaamyaab rahe hai ki congress kii punjab sarkaar main dipti siem kaa pad nahin hona chahie
 According to the information received from the sources, Navjot Singh Sidhu can be sworn in as a cabinet minister and he can be given a heavy ministry
 vahiin sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik navjot singh siddhu abhi bhi lagaataar congress alaakaman or upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi par dabaav banane or dipti siem kaa pad paane kii koshish main lage hai
 Presently, the decision on whether Navjot Singh Sidhu will be the Deputy CM can be taken in the last moments before the swearing in as Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi himself is also reaching Chandigarh to attend the swearing-in ceremony
 vaise punjab congress ke puraane netaa bhi nahin chaahate kinavajot singh siddhujoki vidhansabha chunaav se thik 15 din pehle hi party main shaamil hue hai, unako party main captain amarinder singh ke baad duusare number par rakhaa jaae
 However, no one is openly opposing Navjot Singh Sidhu and while trying to show everything right, all the leaders are saying that there is no difference or difference between Captain Amarinder Singh and Navjot Singh Sidhu and both together Will work together in the interest of Punjab
 punjab congress ke netaa kah rahe hai ki alaakaman ne captain amarinder singh ko open hand de rakhaa he or captain amarinder singh hi ye tay karenge ki unke mantrimandal main kis netaa ko koun sa mantralay or koun sa pad diya jayega

 Out of 85 crore voters, 55 lakh migrant Muslim voters have joined the AIUDF to a large extent, this inexperienced party, which started with 10 mlas in 2006, has come to the center of politics in 2011 and now a more effective number of 18 mlas
