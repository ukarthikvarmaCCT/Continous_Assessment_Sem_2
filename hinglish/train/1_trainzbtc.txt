 During a conversation with Saeed Ansari in the 'come Film Write' session, Juhi said, "I never thought of becoming a writer
 main naukari karte lakhanu se dilli pahunchi or phir mumbai ai
 i got the job of writing films just like that
 "juhi ne kaha, "lakhanu main thi to main arts college main jaati thi
 It was then that he used to do an illustration for the Times of India
 kuch khyaal aate the, likh detii thi
 Never thought of film writing
 "sahitya ajtak: juhi chaturvedi kii class, bataaya- kaise likhen film"lakhanu main kabhi-kabhaar saal main do-chaar baar jaakar filmein dekh leen
 There was no question of watching the film with friends
 filmon se meraa rishta nahin tha
 My grandfather used to say good things at home
 wo kaanon main padati rahati thim us tarah kii baaten
 He was going somewhere in Cannes
 ""bahut saare log yahaan honge jo lakhanu, raibareli jaisi jagahon se honge
 There are people around us with whom we have a very beautiful relationship
 shaayad shaadi se bachane or naukari ke bahaane dilli aa gai
 There was no relation with films
 aid likhte-likhte bombai shift ho gai
 When Shoojit Sircar asked me to write dialogues for his films
 maine aid ke liye unke saath kaaphi kaam kiya tha
 He trusted me that i would be able to write
 ""chaahe aid ho yaa film ho, ye sab nirbhar karata he ki aapke paas kehane ke liye liye kuch he
 Can you remove that feeling kya aap bhaavnaatmak insaan hai yaa nahin
 Do those things touch you inside or not
 lekhak banane kaa sochaa nahin tha, par mere paas shabd the, vichaar tha, kahaniyaan thim
 During my job, Prasoon Joshi (lyricist and chief of the censor board) was my boss
 wo mujhe kehete the ki likho
 When Delhi affected me, Vicky Donor came out
 jab maine is idia ko sochaa tha, tab ek lekhak nahin thi main
 Just what i thought, written later
 ""idia koi bhalaa yaa ajooba nahin he
 It is related to everyday life
 koi aisi cheez jisamen isamen gahari baat he
 The thing that probably applies to a lot of people, but which is ignored
 ""viki donor kii kahani ko lekar mere dimag main bahut zyada thot the
 When i narrated it, there were not many words to say
 maine sunaaya ki ek aadmi he jo duniyabar main sperm donnet karata he, lekin uske khud ke bachche nahin ho pate
 That's all i told, but there was a lot on my mind
 jab maine us idia par kaam kiya viki donor kii kahani bani
 "the scene of Amitabh's death in Piku was written by the writer, 10 days remained shock" i had not done any such big work before Piku and Vicky Donor
 meraa koi pichhlaa kaam nahin tha, isliye himmat puri thi
 i did not even tell anyone that i am writing a film
 main yahi sochati hum ki jab vimal roy ne do bigha jameen banaai yaa sathyajith roy or tamaam nirdeshkon ne aisi filmein bana di, to main sochati hum ki mujhase pehle kai saahsee log ho chuke hai

 Sometimes i feel that i don't know anything except this
 " juhi chaturvedi ne kaha, "main riter banane ke liye riter bani hi nahin thi
 The extension for me is of my own personality
 jo soch he kahani he, use kitna aasaan rakhaa jaae ye sabase zyada jaruri he
 "" Writing and idea cannot be force

 " laal kile ke pracheer se pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa yah paanchvaan or vartmaan modi sarkaar kaa yah antim sambodhan he
 The country has seen his tenure of more than four years and before that he has addressed the people of India four times as Prime Minister from the ramparts of Red Fort
 pehle varsh yani 2014 main jab apni pehali gaiyr congress bahumat vaali sarkaar ke saath pradhanmantri is kile par desh ko azaadi ke din sambodhit karne ke liye khadey hue the to usamen ek drushti thi
 This was the vision of his concept of India and the implementation of the promises he made to the people during his election campaign
 is bhaashan main unhone ek alag tarah se desh ko aage le jane ke or aakraamak tareeke se badlaav laane ke sanket die the
 In later speeches, he was seen attacking the opposition, counting his work and speaking on issues affecting the people directly
 pradhanmantri narendra modike abtak ke kaarykaal main aisa shaayad hi kabhi hua ho jab wo chunaav abhiyaan kii mudra main na nazar aae hon
 There was a reason behind this
 desh main ek ke baad ek rajyon ke chunaav saamne aate rahe or unke bhaashanon kii style or vishay vastu usko dhyaan main rakhkar logon ke saamne aata rahi

 "experts believe that this year's address of the Prime Minister will be an accounting of new works and programs, from counting his achievements
 saath hi wo desh ke saamne yah sanket bhi de sakate hai ki agar logon ko vikaas ke is silsile ko aage lekar janaa he to aagaamee chunaav main unki vaapasi hi ekmaatr vikalp he

 swatantraaa diwas: raashtrapati kovind bole- gandhi ke desh main hinsa kii koi jagah nahinvaise to pradhanmantri ke sabhi bhaashan deshbhar kii nazar main rahete hai lekin laal kile se desh ko sambodhan par logon kii sabase zyaada nazar rahati he
 The Prime Minister knows the importance of the occasion and has been keeping his contents before the people accordingly
 monsoon satr or is baar ke sambodhan ke thik baad desh ko chaar rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav dekhnaa he or un chunaavon ke baad aam chunaavon ke liye desh raajnneetik prachaar sun rahaa hoga
 In such a situation, the final address of his current government to the Prime Minister is a message to the country as well as an election and political opportunity which he knows to use in his favor
 mahangaai or rail kiraye main kii gai vruddhi ke mudde par rajyasabha main bolte hue vittamantri arun jetali ne kaha ki sarkaar mahangaai ko kaabo rakhane ke liye sabhi kadam uthaa rahi he
 He says that the condition of the railway had deteriorated due to the works of the Congress party, the Railway Board approached the government before the interim budget and demanded an increase in fares
 jetali kaa kahana he ki railway 30 hajaar karod kaa ghaataa ho rahaa tha, jisaki bharpai jaruri thi
 In February, the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh accepted the Railway Board's demand for an increase in fares and fares, but he had asked to stay until the election results came
 jetali ne kaha ki is aadesh ke anusaar, railway ne chunaav parinaam aate hi haada badha diya
 Jaitley also told the House that after the results came out on 16 May, the then Railway Minister told the Railway Board that now this order is withdrawn and now the new government will decide it
 jetali ne sadan se kaha ki yah jo kiraaya badha he, yah congress ke khate he or endie ke kaarykaal kaa kiraaya kya hoga yah kal (rail bajet) main pataa chalegaa
 Talking about the prices of petrol and diesel, Jaitley said that the increase in the prices of petrol and diesel is also due to the Congress
 unhone kaha ki dijal ke daam har maah 50 paise badhaane kaa niyam congress party ne banaaya
 Two months before the election, the government did not allow companies to do this
 or phir chunaav parinaam aate hi companiyon ne ek rupaya daam badha diya
 Petrol prices have increased due to the rise in international prices
 khadyann ke mudde par bolte hue vittamantri jetali ne kaha ki har varsh is dauraan keemten badhati rahi hai
 Potato-onion prices are getting noisy, but this time the government took action with the increase in prices and where the prices had reached Rs 70-100 till last year, this time it was between Rs 15-25
 jetali ne sadan ko is maamle uthaae gaye kadamon ke bare main bhi bataaya
 He told that the government has taken several measures to control the price and has succeeded at the moment
 unhone kaha ki pyaaj or aalu kii keemat 25 rupee prati kilo se upar nahin gai he

 ek varisht police adhikari ne don news ko bataaya ki baluchistan ke swasthya mantri rahamat saleh balooch ke kafile ko nishaanaa banaakar us samay hamalaa kiya gaya, jab vah panjagur se prom aa rahe the
 There is no injury to Baloch and his associates in this accident
 adhikari ne bataaya ki aatankwaadiyon ne rocket sahit kai hathiyaaron se hamalaa kiya
 After this, the terrorists managed to escape
 abhi tak kisi bhi aatankwaadi sanghathan ne is hamale kii jimmedaari nahin lee he
 The comments (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) is haadase main balooch or unke sahyogiyon ko koi chot nahin pahunchi he
 The official said the militants attacked with multiple weapons, including rockets
 iske baad aatankwaadi bachakar bhaag nikalne main kaamyaab rahe
 So far no terrorist organization has claimed responsibility for this attack
 tippaniyan (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 )(hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) unhone congress ke aaropon se sahmati jataate hue kaha, ‘pulavama hamale ke vakt pradhanmantri narendra modi korbet neshnal park main ek film kii shooting karne main vyast the
 His shooting continued even after the news of the terror attack came
 ' manase pramukh ne kaha ki pulavama hamale main shahid hue 40 jawan ‘raajnneetik shikaar' bane or har sarkaar ne is tarah kii chijen gadhin, lekin modi ke shashan main yah aksar ho rahaa he
 At the same time, state BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said, 'raj Thackeray has been mimicking throughout his career
 ab vah dobhaal ke khilaaf aarope laga kar rahul gandhi kaa anukaran rahe hai
 'let me tell you, the CRPF convoy was attacked by jaish-e-mohammed militants in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir
 hamale main 40 jawan shahid ho gaye the or kareeb paanch jawan jakhmi ho gaye the
 After this, the Congress targeted PM Modi
 piem modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue congress ne kaha tha ki pulavama hamale kii jaankaree milane ke baad bhi piem modi neshnal corbett park main film kii shooting kar rahe the
 However, later it was reported from government sources that PM Modi's attack was delayed
 aamtaur par dhokhaa dene kii baat ko purushon se jodakar hi dekha jaataa he lekin aisa nahin he ki sirf pati hi apni patni ko dhokhaa dete hai
 There are many cases in which wives also cheat their husbands
 marital and family therapy dwaara 2012 main karaae gaye ek surveykshan main saamne aayaa tha ki ek ore jahaan 22 fisadi shaadishuda mardon ne apni patni ko dhokhaa diya vahiin 14 fisadi aise purush bhi rahe jinako patni se dhokhaa mila
 One thing was also found in the survey that while the main reason for cheating for men was physical, emotional in women
 mahilaayein ko jab imotional sapert nahin miltaa he tab ve apane partner se hatakar kisi or ke saath judati hai
 By the way, apart from this, there are other reasons why women think and cheat their husbands
 jane yahaan-1
 When women do not get the importance and belonging from their husbands or boyfriends, which they expect, they think of someone else
 yah khyaal hi unhen dhokhaa dene ke liye prerit karata he
 2
 kai baar mahilaayein badla lene ke liye bhaapane partner kodhokha detii hai
 If they cheat on their lover or husband, they betray them to take revenge
 3
 Many a times, even when not satisfied with physical relationships, women have the idea of cheating their husbands
 4
 Many times this happens, the women have to listen to their male partners about their body designs
 jaise tumhaara figure uski tarah nahin he
 Your color is suppressed and more
 ye baaten mahilaon ko pasand nahin aati hai or ve khud ko sabit karne ke liye duusare purushon kii ore mud jaati hai
 5
 jab koi mahila kisi purush par nirbhar hoti he to uske liye apane partner ke saath rahanaa ek majaburi ban jaati he
 But most women who are self-reliant put their self-esteem at the top
 jab bhi unhen apane swabhimaan par khatra mandaraata najar aata he to ve partner ko chhodane main vakt nahin lagaatin
 6
 kuch mahilaayein isliye bhi ek saathi ko chhodkar aage bad jaati hai kyonki unhen us shaks se boriyat mahasoos hone lagati he
 It is also true that women cheat their husbands, even for the purpose of doing some new experiments in life

 com / h8eqkewtph — Ryan Hawaii (@RYAN_HAWAII) January 13, 2018 haal main khatm hue sansad ke pehle satr main muslim mahila bill 2017 (protection of ritis on marriage) par sabase zyada charchaa hui
 The bill was debated for 12 hours in both houses of Parliament
 india today data analysis team ne sansad main pesh kiye gaye 39 bilon kaa vishleshan kiya or paaya ki doosraa number indian medical council ko khatm kar banane vaale neshnal medical council bill kaa tha
 The most controversial Jammu and Kashmir reorganization bill to abolish Article 370 was passed in just 7 hours of debate
 hairaani kii baat to yah he ki rajyasabha main ye top ten kii list main bhi shaamil nahin ho paaya, ham aapako bataa den ki anuchhed 370 ko hataane vaala jammu-kashmir punargathan bill pehle rajyasabha main hi pesh kiya gaya tha
 If you look at the number of members debating on any bill in Parliament, then three divorces were given the maximum time
 is bill ko paas karne ke liye donon sadanon se 11 ghante 43 minute kaa vakt laga
 The National Medical Council bill was given 10 hours 54 minutes
 lekin chaunkaane vaali baat ye he ki anuchhed 370 ko hataane vaale bill se zyada jammu-kashmir aarakshan bill par charchaa hui
 The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Bill passed in the Lok Sabha after a debate of 4 hours 11 minutes, while in the Rajya Sabha, this bill was debated for 3 hours 28 minutes
 baaki vivaadaaspad bilon main UAPA bill par 8 ghante 57 minute charchaa hui jabaki soochna kaa adhikaar (sanshodhan) bill ko paas karne main 8 ghante 6 minute lage
 (triple talaq was the most debated in the Parliament session ended recently)
 aap's Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh says "the government gave the opposition very little time to debate the bill
" isse ham thik se taiyaari nahin kar paae, kisi bhi saansad ke liye ye sahi sthiti nahin he
 'he alleged,' The Congress should have led the opposition but it itself seemed confused
 kai baar laga ki wo netritvviheen hai
 Despite opposing the bill, he let the Modi government pass the bill easily
 '(vivaadaaspad artiai bill bhi loksabhaa ke top ten bahason main jagah nahin bana pai)haalanki sarkaar ne vipaksh ke aaropon ko sire se khaarij kar diya he
 BJP spokesman Shahnawaz Hussain says, 'they cannot say that we gave them less time before introducing the bill
 bill pesh karne se jude sabhi nirdeshon kaa paalan kiya gaya tha
 It is a big success of the Modi government that we got a record number of bills passed in such a short time
 '(jammu kashmir punargathan bill bhi rajyasabha kii bahes main top ten main jagah nahin bana paaya)piares lejislative ne aankade jari kiye hai jiske mutabik is satr main 39 bill pesh kiye gaye jinamein 36 bill loksabhaa main paas kiye gaye jabaki rajyasabha se 29 bilon ko manjuuri mili
 The Lok Sabha lasted for 37 days during the session while the Rajya Sabha functioned for 35 days
 aankade bataate hai loksabhaa main 281 ghante kaam hua jo tay seemaa kaa 135% he, pichley 20 saal main sansad ke kisi satr main itnaa kaam nahin hua
 In the last 20 years, an average of 81% of the work was done in a single session
 vahiin rajyasabha main 195 ghante kaamkaaj chalaa jo tay seemaa kaa 100% he
 The average functioning of the state has been 76% in the last 20 years

 Hence BJP is winning by a large margin
 congress pratyaashee manish mishra ne subah aath baje phulpur vidhansabha ke jamunipur sthit primary paathshaala main booth sankhya 386 par matdaan kiya
 Also, after voting at Jwala Devi Inter College in the afternoon, Uttar Pradesh Health Minister Siddharth Nath Singh said that the SP-BSP alliance is opportunistic and it is not for development but for bargaining of Dalit votes

 The truck of any transporter could not come from Uttar Pradesh to Bihar or from Bihar to Uttar Pradesh without paying bribe

 Because of this, around 10 lakh rupees was collected daily on the Chandauli border

 Till date the team reached Chandauli situated on UP and Bihar border to investigate this matter, many secrets of Yadav surfaced
 vahaan jaakar pataa chalaa ki zyaadaatar trek maalik yaa transport 'system' main chalanaa zyada pasand karte the
 Transporters adopting the 'system' had to pay a bribe of between Rs 4000 and Rs 5000 to cross each of their trucks between the 1st and 7th of the month
 har transporter trek kii sankhya ke hisaab se paise detaa tha
 a bribe was given after bribing, showing it and crossing the border easily throughout the month

 Regarding support, the Congress is seen saying that the Patidar leader is with them, while Hardik Patel is repeatedly doing date politics with his support to the Congress
 darasal, har kisi ke liye sawaal yahi he ki aakhirkaar hardik patel apane hi patidaar aarakshan andolan samiti ke do sanyojakon ko tikat die jane ke baad kyon unke tikat ko katwa kar, congress ke patidaar varisht netaa ke saath-saath anya jati ke logon ko tikat dilwane ke liye kaam kar rahe hai
 People and sources living with Hardik Patel believe that in the deal that has happened between Hardik and Congress, Hardik has given many names of people who have been associated with the Congress for years and are also Patidars, in which some people are from other caste
 Are also hardik ne congress ko vishrvaas dilaayaa he ki agar in congressi patidaaron ko congress tikat detii he to use jitaane kii jimmedaari patidaar samaaj khud uthayega

 bijepi jis tarah se ye aarope laga rahi thi ki hardik patel apane saathiyon ke liye tikat ko lekar congress ke saath deal kar rahe hai or congress kaa agent bane hue hai
 It is clear from the ticket distribution that only one of the convenors of Patidar reservation movement along with Hardik Patel, Lalit Vasoya, got the ticket for the first phase, while Hardik supporters are 11 to 12 candidates who He has been associated with the Congress for years and he has got the ticket of this Congress

 ek bade vivaad ko janm dete hue bhaajapa ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi buudhvaar ko mushkil main pad gaye
 After casting votes at a polling station, Modi's speech was expensive to give a speech showing bjp's election symbol
 chunaav ayog ke aadesh par gujarat police ne rajya ke mukhyamantri modi ke khilaaf adarsh aachaar samhita ke ulanghan ke aarope main praathmiki darj kii he
 The police took this action when the Election Commission took serious note of Modi's violation of the election laws under which no person can show any election matter on the day of election nor address a gathering in a polling station
 
 ayog ke aadesh par modi ke khilaaf praathmiki darj kii gai he
 Soon after the commission's order, the Crime Branch Police in Ahmedabad lodged an FIR against Modi
 modi ke khilaaf praathmiki is vajah se darj hui he kyonki aaj subah gandhinagar main apana vot daalane ke baad unhone apni party kaa chunaav chihn 'camel' dikhaate hue bhaashan diya
 Gujarat Director General of Police (DGP) PC Thakur said, 'the city crime branch has filed two firs in this case
 ' ek praathmiki un tivi channelon ke khilaaf darj kii gai he jinhone samvaadadaata sammelan kaa prasaaran kiya tha
 Sources in the crime branch said that as per the directives of the Election Commission, firs have been registered under the provisions of the Representation of People Act
 jin dhaaraon ke tahat praathmiki darj kii gai he, usamen kasuurvaar paae jane par do saal tak kii jail kii sajaa ho sakati he
 Modi sparked controversy when he addressed a press conference soon after casting his vote, showing his party's 'lotus' sign in hand and openly seeking votes for the BJP
 yah ghatana gandhinagar seat ke tahat ahmedabad ke ranip ilaake ke ek matdaan centre par hui
 LK Advani is the BJP candidate from Gandhinagar seat
 is ghatana se krodhit congress ne modi par aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan karne kaa aarope lagaate hue chunaav ayog main shikaayat darj karai or unki ayogyata sahit karrwai kii maang kii
 Other parties also attacked Modi
 aam aadmi party (aap) ne to modi ko 'adatan apradhi' qaraar de diya
 Immediately after receiving the complaint, the Commission ordered the top officials of Gujarat to register an FIR against Chief Minister Modi
 dilli main chunaav ayog ke aadesh main kaha gaya, 'ayog kaa maananaa he ki jis din puure gujarat or desh ke alag-alag hisson main matdaan jari he, us din sabha kar or sabha ko sambodhit kar narendra modi ne janpratinidhitiv kanoon, 1951 kii dhara 126 :1: :e: or 126 :1: :bi: kaa ulanghan kiya he
 ' aadesh main kaha gaya, 'lihaaja, ayog nirdesh detaa he
 
 
 a complaint or FIR, as the case may be, should be lodged against Narendra Modi and all those involved in organizing the said meeting
 ' The Commission had summoned the compliance report from Gujarat Chief Secretary and DGP till 6 pm
 modi par virodhiyon dwaara kiye ja rahe hamalon ke bich bhaajapa pravaktaa minakshi lekhi ne dilli main jor dekar kaha ki modi ne 'chunaav aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan nahin kiya he
 The press conference was not held
 ' baharhaal, lekhi ne kaha, 'chunaav ayog ek sanvaidhanik sanstha he or ham uskaa aadar karte hai
 We will follow his decisions
 ' According to Section 126: 1: (A) and (B), public meetings are prohibited during the 48-hour period before the completion of voting
 iske mutabik, 'koi bhi vyakti (a) kisi chunaav ke silsile main na to koi jansabha yojit karegaa, na jansabha main shaamil hoga or na hi use sambodhit karegaa
 (B) No electoral matter will be shown through cinematograph, television or any other similar device
 ' In the evening, Deputy Election Commissioner Vinod Zutshi said in Delhi that the Gujarat government has sent its compliance report to the Election Commission
 congress ne turant chunaav ayog kaa rukh kiya or modi par adarsh aachaar samhita ke saraasar ulanghan kaa aarope lagaaya
 Responding to questions in Delhi, BJP spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi insisted that Modi had 'not violated the election code of conduct'
 samvaadadaata sammelan yojit nahin kiya gaya tha
 ' baharhaal, lekhi ne kaha, 'chunaav ayog ek sanvaidhanik sanstha he or ham uskaa aadar karte hai
 We will follow his orders
 ' Though it is a trend to make a brief statement by the leaders after casting a vote, but Modi angered his political opponents by holding a press conference after casting his vote
 samvaadadaata sammelan ke dauraan modi ne na sirf matadaataaon se bhaajapa ke liye vot dene kii apil kii balki congress ke khilaaf bhi hamalaa bolaa
 Modi also took a picture from his mobile phone showing his finger and 'lotus' marking with the ink of the vote
 yun to vot daalane ke baad netaaon dwaara sankshipt bayaan dena ek chalan he par modi ne vot daalane ke baad ek samvaadadaata sammelan yojit kar apane raajnneetik virodhiyon ko naaraaz kar diya
 During the press conference, Modi not only appealed to the voters to vote for the BJP but also attacked the Congress
 modi ne vot kii syaahi lagi apni anguli or 'camel' kaa nishaan dikhaate hue apane mobile phone se tasviir bhi lee
 KC Mittal, secretary of the All India Congress Committee's Law Cell, immediately filed a complaint in the Election Commission, saying that Modi's speech and showing the election symbol was a violation of Section 126 of the Representation of the People Act
 mittal ne maang kii ki modi ke khilaaf praathmiki darj kii jaae
 The party said in the complaint, 'it was seen from the live telecast of news on various news channels that Modi went to the polling station in Gandhinagar to cast his vote
 ' party ne apni shikaayat main kaha, 'matdaan ke liye jate vakt vah bhaajapa ke liye prachaar kar rahe the or is andaaj main bhaashan de rahe the jisase lagata tha ki bhaajapa ke liye, khud ke liye prachaar kar rahe hai or vot daal dene ke baad unhone saarvajanik taur par apana chunaav chihn dikhaaya

 duniya ke saamne phir aayaa he taliban kaa kaala cheharaa
 The Taliban have issued a decree in their dominated area of pakistan's Swat Valley that people should marry their daughters to terrorists
 pakistan ke sankatagrast pashchimottar praant main jari taaja farmaan main taliban ne abhibhavakon se kaha he ki wo apni betiyon kaa nikaah aatankwaadiyon se karen
 Failing to do so, the Taliban have threatened to suffer dire consequences
 khabaron ke mutabik pashchimottar pakistan ke zyaadaatar ilaakon main jabariyaa nikaah kaa abhiyaan chalaaya ja rahaa he
 However, when some women complained to the police about this whimsical decree of the Taliban, the black face of the Taliban was again revealed to the world
 pakistan ke akhbaar don ko salama naam kii ek mahila ne bataaya ki taliban ne logon ko masjidon main jaakar apni kunvaari betiyon ke bare main ye elaan karne ko kaha he, taaki unka nikaah karaayaa ja sake
 Not only this, the Taliban have also issued a decree in the Swat Valley that if women are found outside their homes without any identity card or without any male family, then they will have to face serious consequences
 saath hi agar pati-patni bhi ghar se baahar nikalate hai to unhen vivaah pramaan rakhana hoga, nahin to mushkil aa sakati he
 This decree of the Taliban also bothers those who once liked his messages

 Due to illicit relations in Bhavani Enclave of Gurugram, adjacent to Delhi, the wife along with her lover killed her husband
 vaardaat beeti 12 or 13 june kii madhyaraatri kii he, jab police ko control room main soochna mili ki bhavani anchlev ke ek makaan main ek shaks arvind kii sandigdh paristhitiyon main maut ho gai he
 The deceased Arvind lived with his wife Anita on rent in a house in the same colony
 is ghatana kii soochna bhi mritak kii patni ne hi police ko di
 On receiving the information, the police took possession of the body and sent it for postmortem
 postmortem report se hatya ke aropiyon yani mritak arvind kii patni anita or uske aashiq rajan ke khatarnaak mansoobon kaa pardaafash hua
 Arvind would never have even dreamed that the Rajan whom he considers his best friend and shelter in the house, will become the reason for his murder
 darasal sector 9 thana kshetra ke bhavani anchlev ilaake main donon pati-patni anita or arvind rahete the
 Rajan was a close friend of Arvind
 arvind ne ghar kii aarthik tangi ko dekhte hue rajan ko bhi apane ghar main rahane kii ijazat de di thi
 Since then, a series of illicit relations started between the deceased's wife and Rajan
 police kii maane to shuruaati poochtacha main anita kuch bhi bataane ko taiyaar hi nahin thi or police ko bargalane kii koshish karti rahi
 But when the police started investigating the matter seriously due to the seriousness of the case, the statement of the father of the deceased Arvind revealed that Arvind had married Anita 10 years ago and since then Arvind had lived in a separate Bhavani enclave from home
 
 jab mritak kii bivi se sakhti se poochtacha kii gai to anita ne mana ki usne or rajan ne mil kar arvind kaa galaa ghont kar hatya kar di
 After carrying out the crime, Rajan left from there, so that the police have no doubt about Anita and Rajan
 baharhaal police ne donon hatyaropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya he

 That is good, Babuya is engaged in strengthening the party because Amma was so busy running Manmohan and the party was degraded
 party ko phir se bananaa koi khel nahin jab naaraa tak chori ho chukaa ho

 Some are appealing to the students to join the organization, while others are counting their achievements through posters
 dilachasp baat ye he ki FYUP sabhi ke liye sabase bada mudda he
 Every organization wants to take credit for removing it
 darasal FYUP ke khilaaf pichley kuch maheenon main campus main chaatr sanghathanon ne jamkar pradarshan kiya tha
 NSUI spokesperson Ambrish Pandey says that we have removed the FYUP

 The data and trends found in the International Trade Report 2019 of UNCTAD, a UN body, shows that in the last few years, international trade has increased at first modestly (2012–14), then seen a decline (2015 and 2016) and finally It strengthened well in (2017 and 2018)
 utpaadan evam nivesh or camodity keemton main sudhaar kii vajah se vaishvik vyapaar main phir se teji ai he
 However, UNCTAD warns that the future is not very golden, as there is no scope for a huge increase in global production further and commodity prices will either stabilize or start decelerating
 vitt varsh 2018 kii duusari chamahi main hi yah dekha ja chukaa he ki aarthik tarakkee or antarrashtriya vyapaar kii raftaar sust pad gai he
 Also challenging times for India
 Apart from this, there has been 'increased uncertainty' due to various reasons like the weakening of the multilateral trading system, the trade war between China and the US, the problem within the European Union and all these have put pressure on the future stance of international trade Is visible iskaa matlab yah he ki bharat ke liye bhi zyada chunauteepurn samay aa rahaa he
 India will shift its focus from primary commodities such as cotton, cereals, fish, meat and low-tech products to high-value medium and high-tech manufacturing goods
 ucch mulya vaale vaishvik niryaat main bharat kaa hissasaal 2008 se 2018 ke bich ke vyapaarik rukh kaa vishleshan karne vaale WTO ke world trade statistical rivyuu 2019 ke mutabik vaishvik vyapaar main menuphacchard vasteen ab bhi haaavee hai or is dauraan unki vyapaarik hissedari 66 fisadi se badhkar 68 fisadi tak pahunch gai he
 During this period, the share of fuel and mining products fell from 22 per cent to 19 per cent and the share of agricultural products increased from 8 per cent to 10 per cent
 vyapaarik aankadon ke vishleshan se pataa chalata he ki america dollar ke mad main dekhen to medium or hitech menuphaccharing vasteen vishwa niryaat main prabhavi sthaan rakhti hai
 In contrast, Indian exports account for a large proportion of primary commodities and low technology products
 iske alaava dawaaen, tel utpaada, auto componant, diamond jaisi aisi kai vasteen aayaat par nirbhar hai
 India is still struggling to get 2% of global exports in dollar terms
 saal 2010 se 2018 ke bich uski hissedari 1
 5 to 1 7 fisadi rahi he
 India's share in top high value items has also been very weak
 sheersh 10 hai vailu vaali vastuon kaa kul vaishvik vyapaar 19,346 arab dollar kaa hua jisamen bharat kaa hissaa sirf 323
 06 billion dollars or 1
 67 fisadi rahaa
 Professor Nisha Taneja of the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) points to this imbalance
 unhone kaha ki saal 2018 main bhartiya niryaat kaa kareeb 70 fisadi hissaa primary or lo technology vaali vastuon kaa tha, jabaki vishwa niryaat main inkaa hissaa sirf 40 fisadi hota he
 Sanjay Budhia, chairman of the National Committee on Exim of Industry Chamber CII, said India's share in the world's top export items such as electronics and machinery is very low
 saal 2018 main bharat se electronics or mashinari kaa niryaat kramash: 11
 8 billion and $ 20 billion, while their global exports during this period were 2 respectively
 8 trillian dollar or 2
 3 trillion dollars
 haalanki khanij eendhan, ratna evam aabhushan or pharma utpaadon kaa bhartiya niryaat thik-thaak rahaa he
 Despite this, India's exports are not sufficient in terms of its GDP
 UNCTAD kii saal 2018 kii ek report ke anusaar, bharat kaa vyapaar asantulan vaishvik str ke mukaable bahut hi zyada he
 India's trade deficit is very high both in terms of GDP and global trade
 aakhir kya he niryaat ke fike pradarshan kii vajahprofessor taneja bataate hai ki menuphacchard vastuon ke niryaat ko manda karne vaale kaarak kaaphi samay se maujuud rahe hai
 For example, India's competitiveness has been continuously hurt by weak infrastructure, disrupted and inadequate power supply, high transaction costs, harsh labor markets and labor shortages
 duniya main abhootpurv takneekee badlaav ho rahe hai, aise main bharat ko pehle se jari or nai chunautiyon ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 Professor Biswajit Nag of the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) said that India needed the most skills, followed by upgrading products, processes, value chains and improving business infrastructure
 unhone kaha ki kaushal vikaas isliye zyada mahatvapurn he, kyonki isse rojgaar ko niryaat se joda ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, now that the life cycle of the products has reduced, we have to learn fast from the experiences i
e
 mistakes of others
 iske alaava, unhone is baat par jor diya ki innovations ko vyapaar, vyapaar ko vaishvik vailu chen or skill se trade ko jodne ke liye nitiyon or protsaahan kii jarurat he
 Also, a holistic approach has to be adopted for the development of infrastructure
 niti ayog kii ranneeti new india@75 ke mutabik niryaat main ek badi baadha oonchi logistica laagat he
 According to this, the cost of logistics in India is up to 14% of GDP, much less in all countries except China
 logistic laagat main 10 fisadi kii katautee karne se niryaat main 5 se 8 fisadi kii badhat kii ja sakati he
 In the future, these areas will have to be paid attention
 Professor Taneja says that new technology has the potential to make a huge change in the business in which India is lagging behind
 na keval, bharat ko paramparaagat vastu niryaat se nipatane ke liye nai technology ko apnaanaa hoga, balki use apane vailu chen or medium evam hitech vastuon ke niryaat ko aage badhanaa hoga taaki vishwa niryaat main hamaara hissaa upyukt ho sake
 India's trade policy has to be prepared for such goals
 ICRIER kii saal 2019 kii ek study kahati he ki intermediat guds main vaishvik vyapaar bad rahaa he, or yah kul vyapaar main kareeb do-tihaai hissaa rakhte hai
 Also, India's share in the export of such items is also 31 of the total exports in 2011
 18% se badhkar saal 2016 main 32
 Has reached 52%
 isamen un 15 intermediat market combination kii pahchaan kii gai he, jahaan bharat sabase zyada pratispardhi he-chemicals, aayran evam steel articals, glass product, plastic, ledar intermediatory input, coton yarn aadi
 Europe may be the best destination for the export of these goods
 ye ho sakate hai upaaydachhii ke budhiya hai vailu vaale utpaadon ke niryaat ko badhaava dene ke liye kai upaay bataate hai: bazaar protsaahan or vyapaar ko badhaava, aranddy main nijee kshetra kaa zyada nivesh, kaarobaari sugamawa kii nigaraanee ke liye board, pramukh sector main epadiai, vittiya protsaahan ke dwaara innovations main zyada nivesh or vishesh nitiyon ke dwaara chuninda sector tathaa utpaadon kii pahchaan karnaa or unhen protsaahit karnaa
 But all this does not mean that India should ignore the export of primary goods
 haalanki, niti ayog kii new india@75 kii ranneeti main jo vivaran diya gaya he, vah is baat kaa jabardast udhaaharan he ki bharat kaa niryaat kyon pichad rahaa he or sarkaar kaa ravaiya kya he: ‘sabhi pakshon se raay lekar, bharat sarkaar ko ek susangat or sthir krishi niryaat niti banani chahie, paanch se das saal kii avadhi ke liye or madhyavadhi samiksha ke praavdhaanon ke saath
 Immediate efforts should be made to achieve this
 ’yah baat november 2018 kii he or tab se abhi tak is maamle main kuch nahin hua he

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne rafel deal ko lekar pradhanmantri narendra modi par phir se joardaar hamalaa bolaa he
 Rahul Gandhi said that the whole of India understands that the watchman is a thief, and they will show it by proving that the Prime Minister of India is a friend of Anil Ambani and he has stolen from Anil Ambani
 rahul ne kaha ki jis din rafel maamle kii jaanch hogi us din do naam niklenge, anil ambani or narendra modi
 He asked why the Rs 30,000 crore contract was snatched from HAL and given to Anil Ambani? Why was employment taken away from the youth of India? Rahul used strong words and said that the money taken by the thieves belongs to the farmers, there is no going to get caught in their talk
 rahul gandhi ne kaha kipradhanmantriis maamle par press conference kyon nahin karte hai
 He said that his questions on Rafael remain intact
 rafel deal par jepisi kii maang par ade rahul ne kaha ki sarkaar ko is maamle kii jaanch ke liye sanyukt sansadeey samiti banane main aakhir kya dikkat he
 The Congress President said that the Supreme Court was misinformed about the prices of Rafale aircraft
 rahul ne kaha, "supreme court ke faisle main kaha gaya he ki rafel hawaii jahaaj kii keemat ke vivaran kaig kii report main likhe hai or use lok lekha samiti se saajha kiya gaya he
 But Kharge is the president of g PAC and he has not seen any such report
 " rahul ne kaha ki jab koi jhooth bolta he to kahin na kahin nikalataa he
 Now the government will have to explain to them where is this PAC report? rahulne kaha, "ye kaise ho saktaa he ki piesi adhyaksh ne report nahin dikhi, lok lekha samiti ke sadasyon ko is report ke bare main pataa nahin chalaa or supreme court ko dikh gai
 "the Congress President taunted the PM saying that there might be another PAC going on
" shaayad france kii sansad main chal rahi he
 It may be that Modi ji has kept his PAC sitting in the PMO
 rahul ne kaha ki is sarkaar ne sansthaaon kii dhajjiyaan uda rakhi hai
 In Uttar Pradesh's Pratapgad district, some of the barbarians entered the house of a girl and committed the gang rape incident

 Gujarat has its own claims of victory in elections and both parties, BJP and Congress are not ready to claim less than majority
 bhaajapa ke paas pradhanmantri modi jaisaa cheharaa he
 She is seeking votes in Modi's name and is also claiming victory
 use vishwaas he ki 22 saal se rajya main jo satta kaayam rahi he, logon kaa vishwaas usamen bana rahegaa
 At the same time, the Congress maintains the hope that Modi's absence in Gujarat and the disenchantment of the people with the bjp's state government will prove to be alive for him and the Congress will defeat the BJP in the state
 in daavedaariyon ke bich jo ek chiz is chunaav main sabase zyaada mukhar or pratyaksh dikhi wo he logon kaa gussa
 Dissatisfaction with the BJP was clearly visible in the interactions with people from different parts and classes during his visit before the election
 patidaar andolan hi nahin, aarthik sudhaar or rajya kii shashan vyavastha ko lekar bhi logon main khaasaa gussa rahaa
 Although people have been angry towards BJP for the last three elections but this anger has failed to stop Modi's path
 pichley do chunaavon main log gussa to the lekin bhaajapa se behatar vikalp ke taur par wo kisi or dal ko sweekaar nahin kar sake
 But the anger in this time's election is personal, outspoken and multidimensional
 ye bhi padhein
 
 
 More than Rahul, PM is decisive for Modi, Gujarat's mandate will change in votes and this is the reason which has been distracting the BJP from time to time
 puure gujarat chunaav ke dauraan pradhanmantri modi kii bechaini or bhaashanon kaa saar isi bechaini kii chugali karata nazar aata he
 Same was the case with BJP president Amit Shah and other party leaders
 lekin sabase bada prashn phir bhi vahiin kaa vahiin he
 That the vocal anger that is visible among the people of Gujarat, will it be converted into votes
 kya vaaki log apane gusse ko voting mashin ke vikalpon main sthaanantarit kar paaenge
 Is this anger so much that people are intent on removing the BJP, not to win the Congress
 agar aisa he to bhaajapa ke liye yah bahut buree khabar he
 And if this is not the case, it should not be surprising if the BJP returns
 darasal, yah gussa congress ke liye ek zamin kii tarah he
 With this land, Congress can become a factor of change of power
 lekin congress kaa sankat yah he ki amit shah ke prabandhan or bhaajapa ke majboot sanghathan jaisi sthiti uski rajya main he nahin
 Getting votes and managing booths is the most important task in elections
 lekin iske liye congress ke paas eemaandaaree se ladane vaale kaaryakarta hai kya?ye bhi padhein
 
 
 Five reasons, why winning Gujarat is important for Congress President Rahul Gandhi: There may be a situation and the anger of the people is so much that they are not even worried about the booth management of the Congress and they want change
 yah sthiti bhi congress ke paksh main jaaegi
 But if the anger has not turned into a vote or the angry voter has sat at home, then the Congress may look defeated even claiming to win everything
 bhaajapa, darasal, congress se nahin, rajya ke logon ke isi gusse se vichlit he

 ' The attacks of bears have intensified in Balrampur and Ramanujganj districts of Chhattisgarh
 ilaake ke manbasa gaanv main 42 saal ke lakshmana poya naamak shaks ke shaks par bhaaluon ne hamalaa kar diya jisase uski maukey par hi maut ho gai
 In the last one month, the number of people killed by bear attacks has reached 8
 van vibhaag ne marane vaale logon ke parijanon ko 25 hajaar rupee kii aarthik sahaayta dekar apane haath khadey kar liye hai
 The bears are being attacked daily in this area of chhattisgarh
 bhaaluu kabhi bhi jangal se nikal kar gaanv kii ore rukh kar rahe hai
 The forest department has indicated that the bears have started migrating to the countryside due to the lack of water sources within the forest
 is ilaake main acroshit log junglee jaanwaron se suraksha kii maang ko lekar rojaanaa pradarshan kar rahe hai
 The government had launched Project Bear to save the people from the attacks of bears, but even after five years, this plan failed
 is yojana ke tahat jangalon ke bheetar hi bhaaluon ko khaanaa or pani muhaiyaa karana tha, taaki wo gaanv kii ore rukh naa kar saken
 But due to the negligence of the officers, this plan was shelved
 is rajya ke aadha darjan jilon membhaluubahut zyada sankhya main paae jate hai or inaki sankhya main teji se badhotaree ho rahi he
 In the districts of Korba, Raigad, Ambikapur, Vadfnagar, champa-janjgir, Gariaband, Balrampur and Ramanujganj, the terror of the bears is rising
 haal hi main van vibhaag ne gariyaaband ke jangalon main aadamkhor bhaaluon ko goli maarane ke aadesh die the
 Following this, the police shot two of these bears who have become enemies of human life
 bhaaluu se khauf main ji rahe in ilaakon ke log van-vibhaag ke khilaaf rojaanaa pradarshan kar rahe hai
 According to the villagers, the state government had prepared a plan to confine bears to one area
 is yojana ke tahat alag-alag jilon main jangalo ke bheetar bhaaluon ko sangrakshit rakhane ke liye kadam uthaane ke liye kaha gaya tha
 The Forest Department also took action and completed the initial stages under this scheme
 isamen jangalon kii awajahi ke kai raaston main bad bhi lagaai gai thi, lekin yah kaam aadha adhuraa hi hua
 Neither water sources were increased inside the forests nor did the fruit and plants of the forest animals like them
 bhukhe-pyaase rahane ke chalate hi bhaaluon ne gramin aabaadi kii ore rukh karnaa shuru kar diya
 Now the situation is becoming uncontrollable because the population of bears is increasing day by day
 in ilaakon kaa vaataavaran or khaane-pine ke liye muhaiyaa hone vaali vastuon se bhaaluon kiprajnan kshamtabadi he
 All these areas have proved to be a good shelter for them
 rajya ke van mantri mahesh gagada ke mutabik bhaaluu prabhavit ilaakon kii yojanao ke liye unhone tatkaal thos kadam uthaane ke liye nirdesh die hai
 According to him, the Forest Department team is soon being sent to such areas
 uski akalan report ke baad adhuri padi yojanaon ko jald puraa kar liya jayega
 After the defeat in the MCD elections in Delhi, there is no mention of the chaos

 So has the Aam Aadmi Party's dream of national expansion come to an end? Know what is the situation in the rest of the states The BJP may be the biggest beneficiary of this ruckus in the Aam Aadmi Party before the Gujarat assembly elections this year
 apane hi netaaon dwaara aarope lagaae jane ke baad kejariwal baikfoot par hai
 The BJP has intensified the attack
 jaanate hai kin rajyon main aam aadmi party ko nuksaan pahunch saktaa he
 Though there is still three years left for the assembly elections to be held in Delhi, fearing the loss of land, the BJP is upbeat after the recent defeat in the MCD elections and the by-election in the Rajouri Garden Assembly seat
 sansadeey sachiv vaale maamle main aam aadmi party ke 21 vidhayakon kaa maamla chunaav ayog ke saamne he or virodh main faisla aane ke baad party kaa sameekaran gadabada saktaa he
 Assembly elections in Gujarat are to be elected this year in PM Modi and Amit Shah's home state Gujarat
 arvind kejariwal or aam aadmi party pichley do saal se gujarat main chunavi ranneeti par kaam kar rahe hai
 Especially on the issue of corruption, Kejriwal was seen to surround the BJP
 lekin ab khud par cash lene ke aaropon ke baad gujarat main party kii sambhaavnaaon ko bada jhatka lag saktaa he
 Apart from this, the Aam Aadmi Party in Gujarat also had an expectation from Patidar movement leader Hardik Patel but Hardik is now with Shiv Sena
 ye aam aadmi party ke liye rajya main dabl jhatka he
 Why the reshuffle in Punjab? Even though the bjp's ally Akali Dal has lost the election in Punjab, if the BJP wants to carve out a place for itself in the future, it can benefit from the fierce battle in the Aam Aadmi Party
 congress ab rajya kii satta main he or aam aadmi party 20 siten jitkar vipaksh main khadi he lekin aam aadmi party main mache ghamaasan main punjab AAP unit bhi banty hui najar aa rahi he

 maharashtra main bhartiya janata party or shivasena ke bich baat banati hui najar aa rahi he
 After the Congress and NCP alliance in the state, BJP no longer wants to keep Shiv Sena separate from itself
 shivasena ke talkh tevar ke aage bijepi uski sharton par gathbandhan karne ko taiyaar hoti dikh rahi he
 According to sources, if there is an alliance between the two parties in the Lok Sabha elections in Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena may get more seats than the previous election
 sutron kii maane to shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare or bijepi kaa kendriya netritv gathbandhan kar loksabhaa chunaav main saath utarana chaahate hai
 Out of 48 seats in the state, Shiv Sena has put 24-24 seat sharing formula in front of BJP
 isamen palghar seat par bhi shivasena ne daawa kiya he, jise haal hi main hue upachunaav main bijepi ne jeet hasil kii thi
 If sources are to be believed, the BJP has agreed on two additional seats for the Shiv Sena
 iske alaava ek or seat dene ke liye party taiyaar he or saath hi donon partiyon ke bich kuch siten adli-badali jaaengi
 But the BJP is not ready to give up Palghar seat under any circumstances
 sutron kii maani jaae to dona partiyon ke bich 23-25 seat shering formule par sahmati ban sakati he
 Let us know that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP and Shiv Sena contested together with some regional parties
 rajya kii 48 sansadeey siton main se shivasena ne rajya main 20 siton par chunaav ladaa tha or 18 siton main jeet hasil kii thi
 At the same time, BJP contested 24 seats and won 23 seats
 shivasena sutron ke mutabik bijepi ke saath gathbandhan hota he to aisi haalat main shivasena ke khate main siten bad sakati hai
 Shiv Sena is not ready to leave any seat for any other from its account
 wo chaahati he ki bijepi apane cote se anya dalon ko siten de
 In the recent media survey, Congress and NCP have shown a huge edge in Maharashtra
 jabaki bijepi or shivasena ko tagada jhatka lag saktaa he
 Not only this, the bjp-led NDA does not seem to get an absolute majority
 aise main bijepi kisi bhi surat main apane kisi bhi sahyogi ko nahin chhodana chaahati he
 This is the reason why BJP wants to keep its important partner Shiv Sena in Maharashtra with itself

 According to the India Today group-cicero opinion poll, the congress-ncp alliance is going to lose 7 per cent of the votes in this election compared to 2009, due to which its seats could be reduced from 25 to 13
 congress-ensipi gathbandhan ke is nuksaan kaa puraa phayda bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ko mil saktaa he—use 8 fisadi voton kaa phayda ho saktaa he or 12 siton kaa ijapha hone kii sambhaavna ke maddenjar uski siton kii sankhya 20 se badhkar 32 ho sakati he
 Apart from its traditional ally Shiv Sena, the BJP has also tied up with its party by sending Ramdas Athawale, leader of the Republican Party of India, to the Rajya Sabha

 About 10 percent of the population in Maharashtra is Dalit

 The battle for Balasaheb's legacy is still going on
 2012 main bala sahib ke nidhan ke baad yah pehla chunaav he
 The speculation of an alliance between BJP, Shiv Sena and MNS is over, but there is talk of MNS supporting BJP candidates
 india today group-sisero ke opinian pole se pataa chalata he ki bhale hi emenes ne mumbai-thane ke kshetra main apana aadhaar kho diya ho, lekin anya duusare kshetron main iskaa janaadhar bana hua he
 From 2009 onwards, there may be a slight increase in its vote percentage and it can also get one seat
 2009 main emenes ne mumbai-thane ilaake kii 10 loksabhaa siton main se 9 siton par ek lakh se zyada vot hasil karke bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ko jabardast nuksaan pahunchaaya tha

 The suicide of farmers in the Vidarbha region and the alliance of the bjp-shiv Sena alliance with Raju Shetty's self-respecting Shetkari Sanghatna has become a new cause for concern for the NCP

 This is how dual anti-incumbency is working against the UPA

 Farmers' suicides, power shortages and irrigation scams have added to the concerns of the UPA

 But the upa's prospects in the state have been weakened further by getting him a Lok Sabha ticket, while on the other side is Suresh Kalmadi, a three-time Congress MP from Pune (west Maharashtra) and an accused in the Commonwealth Games scam
 
 unhen congress kaa tikat na die jane se upie ke liye samasya khadi ho gai he
 According to the India Today group-cicero Opinion poll, the UPA is trailing in 18 Lok Sabha seats in Vidarbha and Marathwada
 isi tarah kaa haal konkan or pashchimi maharashtra kii 14 siton par bhi he
 Apart from the threat of Raj Thackeray's MNS, the NDA also has its own concerns
 bijepi ke purv adhyaksh nitin gadakari or party kii rajya ikai ke netaa gopinath munde ke bich rishte kathith rup se achche nahin hai
 Shiv Sena's inclination towards Marathi Manus (marathi people) in Maharashtra and bjp's Gujarati identity in Gujarat is completely different from each other
 isaki vajah se kai baar asahaj sthiti paidaa ho jaati he, kyonki badi sankhya main log desh ke duusare hisson se aakar maharashtra main rahete hai
 The appeal of the NDA appears to be limited in about 10 per cent of the Muslim population
 lekin upie kii tulana main endie ke liye samasyaayein or chunautiyaan kam hai

 During this, the Defense Minister said that the entire nation is proud of his courage and perseverance
 raksha mantri ke saaths dauraan vaayu sena ke varisht adhikari bhi unke saath maujuud the
 According to sources, during the meeting at a medical institute of the Indian Air Force, Abhinandan gave detailed information to the Defense Minister about the stay of Pakistan for about 60 hours

 Explain that he was caught by Pakistani authorities on 27 February
 darasal, pakistani ladaaku vimaanon ke saath hui ek jhadap ke dauraan unka mig 21 gir gaya tha
 But he shot down the F-16 of the Pakistani Air Force before his plane fell
 vatan vaapasi ke baad abhinandan kii medical jaanch ke baad unhen ab vaayu sena ke hostel main shift kara diya gaya he
 However, it is not yet clear what has come out in Abhinandan's medical report

 According to information received from sources, the delay in handing the Indian pilot Abhinandan to India was because the Pakistani authorities asked him to record the statement on camera
 iske baad hi unhen seemaa paar karke swadesh jane diya gaya
 Apart from this, issues related to documents also became a reason for delay
 sutron ne bataaya tha ki pakistan ne unki rihaai kaa samay do baar taal diya

 a man who 'harassed and chased' a senior female IAS officer was arrested by Delhi Police from Bihar
 ek varisht police adhikari ne bataaya ki aaropee manoj kumaar ko ek pakhwada pehle giraftaar kiya gaya
 He was produced in a local court where he got bail
 tippaniyan The IAS officer had lodged a complaint at Chanakyapuri police station alleging that the accused had been harassing her since 2008 when she was posted in Bihar

 ) Bollywood producers and workers have settled
 saath hi in kamgaaron kii hadtaal bhi ab shuru hone se pehle hi khatm ho gai he
 Actually, the Bollywood workers were going on strike from 6 May, but the producers accepted their demands, due to which the strike has been postponed
 is hadtaal main parde ke peeche kaam karne vaale sabhi kaamgaar hissaa lene vaale the
 In this strike by Bollywood workers, 22 Bollywood organizations inside the Federation of Veteran India Cine Employees (FWICE) had demanded some demands and money from the producers for almost a year, including security, increase in wages and work
 Demands included setting the deadline
 unki in maangon ko nirmaataaon ne sweekaar kar liya he or nayaa MOU sain kiya gaya he
 As usual this new MOU has been signed for only 5 years
 is nae samjhaute ke tahat pehle saal main 13%, duusare saal main 11%, tisare saal main 11%, chauthe saal main 11% or paanchaven saal main 12% kii dar se mehtaane main badhottaree hogi
 For the past few years, Bollywood employees did not get money for three-three months, due to which these workers had to face difficulties in living for themselves and their families
 lekin ab is nae samjhaute ke tahat nirmaataaon ko 30 din ke bheetar hi kamgaaron ko mazaduri kaa bhugtan karnaa hoga
 Safety was also an important issue in the demands of these workers, as accidents often occur on set and even die

 In the absence of Virat, he did not let the team's energy go down
 wo outfield main tainaat rahe or gendbaazon se acchhee tarah baat bhi karte rahe
 "sridhar also believes that the Ranchi pitch proved to be a good batting track for the first day
 purv captain sunil gavaskar kii tarah shridhar bhi maanate hai ki team india match main vaapasi kar sakati he
 According to him, the England team had also scored well in Mumbai and Chennai in the previous series, but still Team India managed to come back
 wo kehete hai, "ham mumbai or chennai main aise hi halaat kaa saamana kar chuke hai or vahaan bhi hamane jabardast vaapasi kii thi

 He says, "we have faced similar situations in Mumbai and Chennai and we had a tremendous return there too

 The BJP accused Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that he has directly and openly blamed the former Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee for the current poor economy of the country, proving that as an economist he is over-estimated while He is not understood as the consummate political leader he is
 party ke varisht netaa yashavanth sinha ne yahaan bhaajapa mukhyalay main press vaarta ke dauraan pradhanmantri ke ek akhbaar main chape intervyuu par unhen aade haath lete hue kaha, ‘pranab ke vitt mantri pad se istipha dene ke baad us vibhaag ko ab singh khud dekh rahe hai lekin unke bayanon se aisa prathit ho rahaa he jaise koi puraani sarkaar chali gai or ab vah uski bhuulon ko sudhaar rahe hai
 He sarcastically said to the Prime Minister, 'god bless the soul of the Finance Minister as Pranab
 ’unhone kaha, sabase haasyaaspad baat yah he ki manmohan pranab ke faislon ko ab apane se alag karke dikhaane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 He is saying that the last few decisions have to be changed
 sinha ne kaha ki jabaki hakeekat yah he ki kisi bhi vitt mantri ke bajet prastaavon or yahaan tak ki uske bajet bhaashan ko pradhanmantri hi antim anumati detaa he
 He said that the Prime Minister cannot separate himself from the decisions taken during the time of former finance ministers of the UPA government like Pranab Mukherjee and p Chidambaram
 hamaari vyavastha unhen aisa karne kii ijazat nahin detii
 Asked whether the Prime Minister is indirectly blaming Pranab's head for the deteriorating economy of the country, the BJP leader said, "not indirectly, directly and openly blaming Pranab, who till a few days ago His most senior colleagues were
 yahi nahin, aisa bhi nahin he ki pranab ritair ho gaye hai, balki vah to ab desh ke sarvocch sanvaidhanik pad ke ummidavaar hai
 He said that the Prime Minister is blaming him today as Finance Minister by distancing himself from Pranab's decisions, while he has been a partner of all those decisions
 vah tab bhi tukur tukur dekh rahe the or ab bhi tukur tukur dekh rahe hai
 Continuing the barrage of attacks on the Prime Minister, Sinha said that Manmohan's entire life was an attempt to escape from his responsibilities and accountability
 unhone kaha ki singh ke pradhanmantritv kaal main tamaam bhrashtachar hue lekin vah sarkaar ke sarparast hote hue bhi ‘keechad main camel bane rahanaa chaahate hai
 "asked whether Pranab was made the presidential candidate for the reason that the government could keep his image clean, blamed for the mess of the economy, he said" probably "
 pradhanmantri ke intervyuu ke kathy ke bare main unhone kaha ki use pard kar aisa laga ki pradhanmantri nahin balki sarkaar kaa mukhya salaahkaar bol rahaa ho ki hamen yah karnaa chahie vah karnaa chahie lekin ek jagah bhi yah nahin kaha ki yah karenge, vah karenge
 Singh's interview was described by Sinha as a "statement of defeat, frustration and a dark future"
 baharhaal unhone manmohan ko is baat kii badhai di ki ‘ek jamaane baad hi sahi, unhone apana munh to kholaa
 In the interview, he strongly objected to the Prime Minister's assertion that the UPA government had to take a lot of time to correct the wrong decisions of the six-year NDA rule
 sinha ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ne haalanki isi intervyuu main yah sachai sweekaar kii he ki unki sarkaar main raajnneetik aam sahmati nahin he, jiske chalate kai mahatvapurn faisle nahin ho sake hai
