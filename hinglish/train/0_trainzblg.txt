 amarnath yatriyon par hue aatanki hamale ke baad dilli ke jantar-mantar par pradarshan kaa daur shuru ho gaya he
 Some were calling this attack a murder in the name of religion and some were condemning it by associating it with politics
 in sab ke bich sabase bada sawaal ye he ki kya pradarshan kar rahe log jo khud ko bhale hi raajnneeti se upar maan rahe hon, kisi vyakti vishesh yaa jaati par ungali uthaa kar kya wo khud dharm ke naam par ho rahi hinsa kaa hissaa nahin ban rahe?kehane ko to amarnath yatriyon par hue hamale ke virodh main pradarshan kiye gaye par sawaal aatankiyon ke mansoobon or unke peeche chhipi takaton par uthaae gaye
 One protesting group blamed the neighboring countries for the terrorist attacks and the other called the Modi government sitting at the center as the sponsor of these attacks
 vahaan ho rahi narebaaji yaa play cards par likhe shabd cheekh-cheekh kar khud ke secular hone kii gavaahi de rahe the
 But the questions that were arising from among them were enough to open the poll of the intention of honest brotherhood of these groups
 ai stand for india campesmarnath aatanki hamale ke turant baad ai stand for india campan kii soshal media main shuruyaat hui
 Thousands of youth joined it and at 6 pm on Tuesday, vigorous demonstration began with 186 meter long tricolor
 padosi mulk ke khilaaf jam kar naare lagane ke baad munh tod jawaab dene kii dhamkee bhi di gai
 Rahul, the sponsor of this campaign, clearly said, "if such attacks are not stopped soon, then the youth of the country will now come forward to answer themselves, now is the time that the full stop on the terrorist attacks in the name of religion Lage and the youth of the country are capable to respond to this
 "note in maay nem campankuch aise hi alphaajon ke saath note in maay nem campan soshal media ke jariye jantar-mantar tak puhancha
 The motive was to oppose the name-based killings and raise voice against mob lynching
 khud ko raajnneeti se dur rakhte hue sawaal centre par baithi modi sarkaar par uthaae gaye or hindu sanghathanon ko nishaanaa banaate hue bhaichaare kaa sandesh diya gaya
 They also believe that the youth of the country will not tolerate any more, and now the time has come to raise their voice against such forces
 rimjhim barsaat ke bich jantar-mantar par hue ek ke baad ek pradarshnon kaa tarika bhale hi alag rahaa ho par makasad ek hi dikhaa
 Raising their voice against violence perpetrating religion and caste, they have themselves become part of the politics against which they took to the streets

 After this, there was a strong flood, Sonia Gandhi pushed the spg's security forces away completely because her back was very close to Manmohan Singh
 phir espiji ke teen chaar surakshakarmiyon ko dhakela or aage kaa rasta banaaya
 In the midst of this shock, where Sonia Gandhi was with Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi was with AK Antony

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has admitted that the Supreme Court did not say that the watchman is a thief

 At the same time, clarifying his statement, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has said that during the election campaign this statement came out of his mouth in excitement
 rahul gandhi ne mana he ki supreme court ne aisa nahin kaha tha ki 'chaukeedaar chor he'

 He said that during the excitement of the election campaign, the decision of the Supreme Court in the Rafael Review case came, during which the reaction came out of his mouth
 lekin virodhiyon ne unke bayaan ko tod marod kar or galat manshaa se project kiya he
 Rahul Gandhi also said that his statement in the media that 'the Supreme Court has agreed that PM Modi has committed corruption in the Rafale deal' was against the statements in which his opponents have been saying since 14 December that the Supreme Court Clean chit

 sangh prishthbhumi se aane vaale amer ke vidhayak satish punia ko bijepi ne rajasthan kaa pradesh adhyaksh banaaya he
 Since the death of Madan Lal Saini, the post of state president of BJP was lying vacant in Rajasthan
 dilli main is pad ke liye bijepi netaaon ke bich jabardast lobing chal rahi thi
 Earlier Satish Poonia was put in charge of the membership drive by BJP and it is believed that Satish Poonia did a very good job in these 2 months
 ise dekhte hue kendriya netritv ne punia ko rajya ke kaman dene kaa faisla kiya
 There is a strong faction of Vasundhara Raje in Rajasthan who wanted to have a state president of her choice in Rajasthan but BJP has chosen BJP leader Satish Poonia, who is considered to be a strong opponent of Vasundhara Raje, to the post of state president
 haalanki vasundhara raaje ne satish punia ko phone par badhai di he
 For the first time a Jat community leader is sitting on the post of BJP state president
 satish punia ne kaha, 'bijepi main koi bada yaa chota meraa nahin he
 We will do the party work in Rajasthan as per the directions of our national president Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 is party main chote kaaryakartaaon ko sammaan mila he jahaan tak jat jati kii baat he to bijepi main is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main sabhi jatiyon kaa vot mila tha
 It is a good thing that i come from a poor peasant family
 'vasundhara raaje kaa alag khemaa hone ke sawaal par kaha ki kii party main koi bhi netaa hota he to uske kuch foloar hote hai, lekin aakhir main sabhi log party ke kaaryakarta hote hai or party jo tay karti he usee par sabko chalanaa hota he
 The Rajputs have dominated the BJP since the time of Bhairon Singh Shekhawat
 rajputon ke naaraazgi ke baavjood ise ek bada varg rajputon kii party maanata rahaa he
 However, by bringing Vasundhara Raje, the BJP had experimented in the state and associated the Jats with the names of Rajput's daughter and daughter-in-law of Jat
 magar abhi bhi jat samudaay ke zyada vot congress ke saath rahata he
 In such a situation, BJP has tried to make a dent in the traditional vote bank of the Congress by making Satish Poonia coming from the Jat community

 Knowing that despite the attack on Mamata Banerjee's "politics of Muslim appeasement", the party was not getting enough votes from Hindu voters, the Bharatiya Janata Party has now decided to reach out to 'liberal' Muslims
 19 farvari ko party kii rajya ikai muslim samudaay ke liye ek rajyastareey sammelan kii mejabani kar rahi he, jiskaa sheershak he-'narendra modi or alpsankhyakon kaa vikaas'

 BJP General Secretary Debashree Roy Chaudhary says it is to 'inform and educate' Muslims about all the work that the Prime Minister has done to 'empower' them
 udhaahranswaroop ve ''teen talaak se sambandhit aitihaasik faisle kaa hawala detii hai, jo lakhon garib muslim mahilaon ke liye vardaan ke rup main aayaa he
 Neither the Congress nor any other government dared to do so, even though he was seen as a friend of Muslims
 ''choudhary kahati hai ki samay aa gaya he, jab musalamaanon ko yah pataa chalegaa ki modi kii aguai main bhaajapa sarkaar ne kya hasil kiya he
 She cites the withdrawal of an annual Haj subsidy of Rs 700 crore, which will now be applied to the education of Muslim girls
 ve kahati hai ki yah asli vikaas he, congress or trinmul congress kii tushtikaran vaali niti nahin ''ham yah bhi bataaenge ki kaise modi ji ne uttar pradesh main saiyad mohsin raja ko uttar pradesh kaa alpsankhyak maamalon kaa mantri banaaya, jabaki party ne ek bhi muslim ko chunaav kaa tikat nahin diya tha
 Chaudhary says that the saffron conference will also focus on how bjp-ruled states have served Muslims better
 jaise gujarat, jahaan das fisadi sarkari karmchaaree muslim hai, jabaki trinmul congress ke shashan main bengal main sarkari kaarybal main musalamaanon kii bhagidaari mushkil se teen fisadi he
 Ghosh says that Muslims want the right to equality, not bailout, charity or appeasement
 1 farvari ko hue uluberia loksabhaa upachunaav ke nattejey spasht karte hai ki muslim matadaataaon kii upeksha kar bhaajapa ko trinmul congress ko haraane kii baat sochni bhi nahin chahie
 The seat is 40 per cent Muslim and the Trinamool Congress candidate won by 4,74,000 votes while the BJP came second
 haalanki uskaa mat pratishat jarur badha
 The BJP is also considering this event of February 19 as important for the Panchayat elections to be held in may-june this year

 However, Hassan Gafoor himself does not believe that the Mumbai attack has fallen on him

 In fact, the action taken committee's report on the investigation report of the Ram Pradhan Committee on the work of top police officers in Mumbai attack is to be laid before the Legislative Assembly in the coming week and in such a situation, keeping Hassan Ghafur in office could have increased the problems of the government
 lihaaja maharashtra sarkaar ne pehle hi mumbai police kamishnar pad se hasan gafoor ko hataane kaa faisla kar liya

 On Friday, the people of Saket Nagar area of varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, witnessed a wedding where the bride and groom put a garland of onion garlic around each other's neck
 yahi nahin shaadi main aane vaale mehmaanon ne bhi gift ke taur par kapal ko pyaaj or lahasun diya
 According to people opposing onion prices, such gifts have been given to the central and state government to show the mirror
 banaras main pyaaj ko lekar virodh kaa ye silsilaa nayaa nahin he
 Some of the restaurant owners here have put up notice boards that radish will be served instead of onion
 bataa den beete dinon bengalooru main pyaaj kii keemten 200 kaa aankada chhu chuki hai
 Onion was also sold in the capital Delhi at Rs 100-120 per kg
 baaki hisson main bhi keemten aasmaan chhu rahi hai
 The reason behind this is being said to be unseasonal rain, which has destroyed the crop
 rashtriya rajdhani main dengue ke maamle badhane ke maddenjar emsidi ne monsoon ke dauraan apane swasthya adhikariyon ke saptahik avkaash radd kar die hai
 These officers will be given leave only due to medical reasons

 film kaa naam:shorguldiarector:pranav kumaar singh or jitendra tiwaristar cast:ashutosh rana, jimi shergill, sanjay suri, narendra jha, suha gozan, dipadas rana, hiten tejavaani, ejaj khaivadhi:2 ghanta 12 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga:2 starhar ek dashak main raajnneetik balldrop par bahut sari hindi filmein banaai gayi hai
 An attempt has been made to cache this issue once again through 'noise'
 controvarsi se ghiri hui ye film 'shorgul' kisi he? aaiye samiksha karte hai-kahani:-film kii kahani uttar pradesh ke lakhanu ke paas ke malihabad kii he, jahaan gaanv kaa ek choudhary (ashutosh rana), ek vidhayak ranjit om bhaiya (jimmy shergill) or hindu-muslim parivaar rahete hai
 Chaudhary's son Raghu (anirudh Dave) and Zainab (suha Gozen), a girl from a nearby Muslim household, are close friends since childhood
 vah saath-saath college bhi jate hai
 When Zainab's marriage is decided to Salim (hiten Tejwani), then something happens due to the presence of Salim's brother Mustakin (ejaz Khan), which leads to Raghu's death
 ek hindu ladke kii maut hone se puure malihabad main hindu-muslim dange shuru ho jate jate hai
 It also gets given a political color and ultimately has a typical end of the film
 script:-film kii kahani raajnneetik drama he jise aap kai dashakon se dekhte aa rahe honge
 Here an attempt has been made to show love story and politics by mixing it
 sanvaadon main kaaphi dam he lekin kahani vahi puraani he, jisamen aakarshan kam he
 The handwriting reminds you of the 90s which could have been improved
 vaise to maatr 132 minute kii film he lekin dekhte-dekhte kaaphi lambi lagane lagati he
 The screenplay could have been further tightened
 abhinay:-abhinayta ashutosh rana ke sanvaadon or acting kaa mujaharaa ek baar phir se aapako dekhne ko milegaa
 The work of Vahijimmi Shergill is also commendable
 abhinetri suha gozan ne bhi kaaphi acha abhinay kiya he
 The work of Ejaz Khan, Hiten Tejwani, Narendra Jha, Sanjay Suri and Deepdas Rana is also effortless
 kamjor kadi:-film kii kamjor kadi isaki ghisi pity kahani he jis par or bhi zyada kaam karne kii jarurat thi
 The film is so spread out in the beginning of one and a half hours that it is very difficult to cover it in the end
 jiske kaaran clymex kaaphi ghisa pita sa dikhaai dene lagata he
 At the same time, actors like Sanjay Suri, Narendra Jha, were given a very small role, which does not seem to be fair and gets lost in the crowd
 sangeet:-film kaa sangeet sahi he jo kii kahani ko sahi tareeke se aage le jaataa he
 Kapil Sibal has also written songs while songs composed by Lalit Pandit also look good
 kyon dekhen:-agar aapako ashutosh rana, jimmy shergill jaise manze hue kalakaar or raajnneetik muddon par aadhaarit filmein pasand hai, to ek baar jarur dekh sakate hai
 Pakistan's opposition leader Imran Khan has announced a civil disobedience movement against the government led by Nawaz Sharif

 imran samarthak pradhanmantri sharif ko pad se hataane ke uddeshy se lahore se aazaadee march main shaamil hone aae hai
 Significantly, in the 2013 general election, Sharif won 190 out of 342 seats
 khan kii party 34 siten lekar tisare sthaan par ai thi
 Khan claimed that his party should have got many more seats, but could not get due to Sharif's PML (N) rigging
 isse pehle, danda liye pakistan taharik e insaaf ke pradarshnakariyon ne contenron par prahaar kiya or red jone ke raste main pad rahe contile taar hataa die
 Qadri is demanding the arrest of Sharif and his brother Shahbaz on June 17 in Lahore for killing 14 of their supporters
 unhone sharif ko istipha dene ke liye 48 ghante kaa ultimatum diya he
 He said that if Nawaz Sharif and his men are allowed to rule the country, the very existence of the country will be at stake

 The Rafale deal is not taking the name of ending the dispute in the country
 congress is vivaadit deal ko lekar sansad main sanyukt sansadeey samiti (jepisi) ke gathan kii maang kar rahi he to purv vitt mantri yashavanth sinha samet arun shouri or prashanth bhushan ne buudhvaar ko rafel vivaad par supreme court main punarvichaar yachika daakhil kar di he
 It has also sought a reconsideration hearing in open court
 in teen logon kii ore se supreme court main daayar yachika main kaha gaya he ki faisle main kai trutiyaan hai
 The Supreme Court's decision rests on erroneous claims made by the government in a sealed unsigned note that violates the principle of natural justice
 is yachika main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki maamle main faisla surakshit rakhe jane ke baad kai nae tathy prakaash main aae hai, jinke aadhaar par maamle kii jad tak jane kii jarurat he
 The court has dismissed earlier petitions
 The Supreme Court in December last year dismissed all the petitions related to the Rafale Dealer investigation
 rafel kii keemat par court ne kaha tha, 'keemat se jude vivaran kaig (sieji) se saajha kiye ja chuke hai or kaig kii report kii jaanch-parakh piesi kar chuki he
 After the court's decision, PAC (public Accounts Committee) Chairman Mallikarjun Kharge denied any such report and requested the Public Accounts Committee to summon the Attorney General and the CAG to ask that Rafael deal When was the CAG report tabled in Parliament
 centre kii safyeesieji kii report piesi ke paas bheje jane ko lekar uthe vivaad par centre sarkaar ne apni safai pesh kii or kaha ki hamane court ko gumraah nahin kiya, balki hamaari daleel ko court ne galat samajha
 The Center sought an amendment to the apex court's decision on the Nerafel fighter jet deal that contains references to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report and the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki uske note kii alag-alag vyakhya ke kaaran yah vivaad paidaa hua
 The Center in its affidavit clarified that it was not saying that the CAG report was tested by the PAC or that the edited portion was placed before Parliament
 is bich, rafel deal ko lekarcongress pravaktaa randeep singh surajevalane buudhvaar ko ek audio jari kiya
 Surjewala claimed that in the Goa Cabinet meeting a few days ago, Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar had said about the Rafael files that no one can do anything about them, they have all the files

 Prateek is not in politics and does business
 kehete hai ki mulaayam, pratik ko raajnneeti main nahin laana chaahate the taaki akhilesh ke raste main koi rukaawat nahin aae
 But his wife wanted that if Prateek cannot get into politics, then at least Aparna should get a ticket

 Ram Vilas Sharma Shambhunath Sahitya Academy, New Delhi, Price: Rs 100
 yah ramvilas sharma kaa janmashti varsh bhi he
 After Acharya Ramchandra Shukla, Dr
 sharma hindi ke duusare bade aalochak hai, jinhone shukla kii tarah hindi sahitya kaa vyavasthit itihaas to nahin likhaa lekin bhaaratendu se lekar niraala tak par unki jaisi pustaken ain, vastutah hindi sahitya kaa itihaas hi hai
 His writings began with poetry and some of his poems were also compiled in the agnostic edited Tar Saptak (1943)
 varshon baad unka swatantra kavita sangrah rup tarang bhi niklaa lekin unhone apane aalochak ko zyada mahatv diya
 In 1934, his first article in Chand magazine appeared on Nirala's poem
 yah kitaab vastutah varshon baad teen khandon main chhapi niraala kii sahitya sadhana kii bhoomika maatr thi, jisamen unhone niraala ke jivan or lekhan kii rekhaaen khinchi thim, rang usamen baad main bharaa
 His study board contained language, society, culture, history
 shambhunath kaa yah viniabandh ek choti pustak he, jo is shrinkhalaa kii seemaa he lekin unke jivan or lekhan ke tamaam sarokaaron ko sametati hui
 The first chapter was written by Dr

 He was a student of English, later became a professor but after meeting Nirala in 1934, he made life's mission to serve Hindi literature
 ek anya adhyay main unke sarokaaron ke daayre kii padtaal kii gai he or nishkarsh yah niklaa he ki ''ramvilas sharma ek saahitiyik aalochak hi nahin, samaaj chintak bhi the
 There was a deep sense of social consciousness among them

 '' Dr
 sharma ne apane samay or khud pragatisheel aalochakon se takaraate hue hindi pradesh or bharat kii saanskrithik viraasat kaa nae sire se moolyankan kiya
 He not only considered 1857 as a departure point in Indian history, but also the beginning of Hindi Renaissance
 yahi kaaran he ki unhone navajagaran ko dhyaan main rakhkar aadhunik saahitiyik parampara kaa vistrut moolyankan kiya
 Due to his wide area of interest, he also turned to linguistics and saw Hindi being associated with India's ancient language family
 hindi jati kii avadharana unheen kii pariklpana he
 Though the concept of Renaissance was developed by Sharma itself, which differed but the writers of modern Hindi whom he saw in the light of Renaissance are authentic
 ab pragatisheel andolan main sharma kii bhoomika par hi nahi, unke dwaara muktibodh ke moolyankan par bhi ungali uthaai ja rahi he
 Nevertheless, it will be difficult to ignore them in the development and history of modern literature
 unke antarvirodh khub the or kuch purvaagrah bhi
 Gradually this thing is emerging
 shambhunath ne parishram purvak unke jivan or lekhan ko vastuparakata ke saath pesh kiya he

 The problems of the Modi government and the people of the country may increase due to the low monsoon
 july main ab tak puure desh main kareeb 85 fisadi hisse main saamaanya se 43 fisadi kam barish hui he
 The Meteorological Department had already predicted a low monsoon this year
 haalanki mausam vibhaag ne 18 july ke baad barish kii ummid jataai he
 The government has started preparations to tackle the low monsoon
 isi ke tahat kii gai baithkon main kam monsoon hone par 500 jilon main apaat lagane, kisaanon ko beej or khaad sabsidi dene kii baat kahi gai
 According to meteorological data, 85 per cent of the country is experiencing deficient rainfall
 kam monsoon ke chalate sabase bura haal madhya bharat kaa he jahaan ab tak saamaanya se 63 fisadi kam barish hui he
 The area has the highest rice yield
 purvottar bharat main bhi 22 fisadi kam barish hui he
 So far, rainfall in western Uttar Pradesh has been 71 percent less than normal
 kam monsoon ke chalate modi sarkaar kii dikkatein bad sakati hai
 However, in a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley claimed that the government is prepared to deal with the bad situation in the low monsoon
 jetali ne kaha, 'desh main kharaab monsoon ke kaaran koi sankat paidaa nahin hoga
 States where the monsoon has been low so far

 The budget session 2012 is going to create a lot of stir for political reasons, but if any thing Union Union should seriously consider any thing then it is resource capacity
 is par keval is satr main nahin, balki aane vaale kai varshon tak bhi acha-khaasaa chintit hone kii jarurat he
 Regardless of whoever is in power, the issue of resource efficiency is important for every party
 agar ham lagaataar oonchi aarthik vikaas dar chaahate hai, jarurat ke mutabik bijli tak apni pahunch badhanaa chaahate hai, khaadya suraksha or rojgaar guarantee dena chaahate hai or haai technology product viksit karnaa chaahate hai to sansaadhan kshamta aisa ahm kshetra he, jisamen bharat ko sudhaar karnaa hoga
 To make India an economic power, all these issues have to be worked on for a long period
 isliye sansaadhan kshamta keval vitt mantralay tak simit maamla nahin he, balki yah petroleum or prakritik gas mantralay, krishi, jal sansaadhan, urja, koyala, khaadya or rasayan, akshay urja, van or paryaavaran mantralay aadi se bhi judaa masalaa he
 It does not need to mention the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Ministry of External Affairs
 sudhaaron kii prakriya ke antargat teen kaarak hamaari ahm praathamiktaayen hai
 First, oil and gas need to be conserved in the true sense
 bhale hi urja kii khapat karne vaale duusare pramukh deshon ke mukaable urja kshamta ko lekar bharat kaa pradarshan apekshaakrit behatar ho, lekin yah apni jaruraton kii khatir tel or gas ke oonche aayaat par nirbhar he
 Oil and gas imports are expected to reach 90 per cent of the country's total demand
 duusare pramukh tel ayaatkon kii tulana main ham pashchim asia par zyada nirbhar hai
 We import 63 per cent from West Asia, while China 46 per cent
 agar pashchim asia main kisi tarah kaa sankat hota he or hydrocarbon kii keemten badhati hai to isse hamaare aayaat bill main 118 arab dollar (5,90,000 karod ru
 )
 vahiin, gas kaa gharelu utpaadan bhi anumaan ke anuroop nahin he
 In such a case, the import bill will increase
 tab kya kiya ja saktaa he?sankshep main kahen to apane sansadhano ko bachaana hi phydemand he
 These options can be considered: reducing corporate income tax on energy conservation standards, VAT concession on reuse of industrial waste as production inputs for proper exploitation of energy, accelerated depreciation on the cost of purchasing energy-saving equipment
 Benefits, incentives on purchase of smaller and more efficient motor vehicles, tax concession on reducing energy consumption in commercial buildings and higher Ga saving income tax incentives for equipment
 doosraa ahm kaaran, sabhi sectoron main pani ke istemaal ko ekikrut karne kii khatir jal sansaadhan khaakaa taiyaar karnaa, har tel kshetra ke liye management kii shuruyaat karnaa, sarvice delivery behatar bananaa, pani kaa prabandhan karne waalon kaa kaushal badhanaa or vitaran maapne ke liye behatar sadhano kaa istemaal
 Third, strategic efforts are needed to correct the financial situation in the long term
 rashtriya, antarrashtriya funding ke madhyamon or vittiya sansthaanon ke kaamkaaj ke samanvay ke liye saajha manch banane kii jarurat he taaki lambey samay ke liye upyogi technologies ke liye majboot vittiya or technological market viksit kiya ja sake
 The platform functions as strategic level (priority sector lending, concessional lending, long-term debt, research and research funding, payment guarantee), project level and supporting support standards (information, skill development, incentives in investment)

 ladakiyon ke bare main ladakon ko sirf tamaam tarah kii phantsi main hi nahin rahete hai
 Apart from the beauty of girls, boys often think very differently about girls' behavior
 kai ladakon ko ladakiyon kii kuch aadaton se bahut nafrat hoti he
 Even if they do not reveal it in front of their friend, but they definitely keep thinking something in mind
 aaie jaanate hai ki aakhir ladakiyon ke bare main ladke kisi soch rakhte hai
 
 
 1
 bolti bahut he yaar:ladako ko lagata he ki har ladki bolne vaali hoti he
 So it only means that you have not been raised by girls who keep quiet or speak in a balanced manner
 aisi ladkiyaan bhi hai jo jaanati hai ki unhen kab, kahaan or kitna bolnaa he
 2
 shringaar kaa riple:apni chand si surat baar-baar dekhne par bhi ladakiyon ko chidhaayaa jaataa he
 But there are many girls too, who without their make-up smile, have the ability to give coolness like rain even in hard sunlight
 3
 Come Sister Chugli: Hanging from the balcony of the houses or in the middle class, girls are often seen discussing social issues, which the world has named Chugli
 aise main hamen un ladakiyon kii bhi nahin bhoolanaa chahie jo man main apane dukh samete rahati hai
 4
 shopping, shopping, shopping:tension kam karne se lekar bwoyfriend ke saath ladakiyon kii sabase badi jarurat shopping ko samajha jaataa he
 Shopping bags are attached to their identities, hanging like rattan bags in the hands of girls
 5
 lup-loop in Driving: People who take inspiration from Dhoom films do not consider girls to be better at driving
 par aise main ham sunita williams or kalpana chawla kii antariksh kii yatra ko bhula dete hai
 6
 sanvarne main vakt:puraa chand bhi 30 din baad dikhataa he
 But the minor three-four hours it takes for the girls to be groomed, the bloodthirsty world adds more time to decorate
 unhi ladakiyon kii khubsuurati kii vajah se doston main apni jamaai dhak ko koi jodakar nahin dekhtaa
 7
 ladki kaa cook hona jaruri:ek aam dhaaran he ki ladako ke dil kaa rasta pet se hokar gujarata he or dil tak pahunchane kaa kaam ladakiyon kaa hota he
 Therefore it is considered necessary for them to cook
 8
 Pink means girl: Those who associate pink cheeks with pink clothes believe that the favorite color of girls is pink
 hindi filmon or archies gailaree kaa isamen khaasaa yogadan he
 9
 roti bahut ho:zyaadaatar ladakiyon ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki ladkiyaan roti bahut hai
 If the crying girl says to break the relationship, then the boys themselves start shedding tears
 10
 Poor to propose: Boys think that it is their responsibility to express love
 ladakiyon ko aamtaur par kaha jaataa he ki ki ladkiyaan prapoj kaise kar sakati hai
 But nobody pays any attention to the fact that after proposing, the girls do the job of running the relationship for a long time
 11
 Golgappa, chatter-patter: The fun of life is in sour and in this way the most girls are seen enjoying life with sourness
 ye maanane vaale khud kii jubaan ke us swaad ko bhul jate hai, jab shaadi ke pandal main ghuste hi wo golgappas, bhalle kaa patta uthaa lete hai
 12
 ai lav dis tadi, chocolate:gale se chipkaakar, sirahaane nani maa kii tarah tadi rakhana har ladki ko pasand he
 But the boys are beginning to understand this as a means of impressing the girl
 13
 Today cash tomorrow lending: Boys think that girls avoid paying bills in hotels, restaurants
 agar aap bhi aisa sochate hai, to apane ghar kii taraf rukh kiijie, jab aap apni bahan yaa sabase acchhee dost se paise maangate hai
 Girls save money and only give them to you
 14
 Love is not money: i do not want love for money
 har ladke ko yahi lagata he ki ladakiyon ko paise vaale ladako se hi shaadi kerani hoti he

 kamalnath ji aadhyatmik vyakti hai or ramraaja ji ke nagar main vikaas ke liye koi kor kasar nahin chodenge
 Actually, Ayodhya and Orchha have a deep bond

 Rama beats in the breath of life here

 Apart from the cultural heritage of the city, the Betwa River flowing from the side of the palace makes it a vibrant one

 Although BJP has described it as a sham
 bijepi kaa congress par aropapradesh bijepi upaadhyaksh rameshwar sharma ne 'ajtak' se baat karte hue kaha ki 'congress bhale hi upar se rambhakti kaa chola odh le lekin janata sach jaanati he
 Ram is for everyone, but the question is, who remembers Ram when the time comes and who truly
 congress darasal samaj chuki he ki desh main rahanaa he to dharm ko maananaa padegaa'
 In the name of Ayodhya and Ram, BJP leaders have been claiming their copyright till now but it is believed that with the plan to develop the Orachha, including Ram Van Gaman Path and now Ramraja Temple of Orchha, the Congress gave a tough fight to the BJP in the name of Ram Has prepared

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will begin his visit to China on 14 May from President Xi Jinping's hometown of Xi'an
 china ke raashtrapati ne unhen yah nyauta is khyaal se diya he ki pichley sitambar main gujarat main modi kii aavbhagat kaa kuch udhaar chukaa saken
 Both sides are seeing this as an opportunity to express close personal ties between the two strong leaders
 haalanki shiaan shi kaa vaaki grihnagar nahin he
 Xi was born in Beijing
 unke pita, communist party ke krantikari netaa shi jangashun kaa janm bhale shiaan se 100 kimi dur ek chote-se gaanv phoping main hua tha
 At first sight, Phuping Shansi looks as green as every village in the province
 vahaan hare makke-jowar ke kheton ke bich sarson ke pile phulon kaa vistaar or chaaron or dhul-dhoosarit choti-choti pahadiyaan manoram najaara banaati hai
 But for the last two and a half years, since Xi has become the general secretary of the Communist Party, the whole area has changed a lot
 chini communist party ke mukhiya ke naate pehla saal puraa karte hi shi ne apane nazariye ko jaahir kar diya ki ve duniya main china ko kis sthaan par dekhnaa chaahate hai
 During the tour of Central Asia, Xi mentioned the ancient Silk Route and announced that China would build a new Silk Route for economic activity
 is tarah unhone duniya kii mahashaktiyon main china kii ahmiyat kaa izhaar kiya
 a month later, in South Asia, Xi said that a parallel Silk Silk Route would also be prepared in parallel to this new economic zone, which would connect China with the asia-pacific and Indian Ocean
 is yojana kii vajah se shiaan kii ore nazren uthin or vahaan nayaa nivesh aayaa
 The new technological zone has been expanded to attract foreign investment in Xian
 isamen ek software park kii bhi yojana he jo sthaneey adhikariyon ke mutabik “bangaluru kii tarj” par hi banaaya ja rahaa he
 Fuping's "patriot School of Education" was built before the decade
 yah ab shiaan ke prasiddh terracotta warirs (yoddhaon kii murtiyon) ke baad paryatakon ke liye doosraa bada padaav he
 The history of the Xi family is shown in the museum here
 bagal main ek dukaan par shi jangashun kii murti or yuva shi tathaa pratham mahila peng liyuan kii tasveeron vaali ceramic plate bikati he
 While Modi would be walking with Xi in Xi'an and carrying on the talks on the banks of the Sabarmati in September, he would realize that the Chinese he had visited as chief minister of Gujarat four years ago would now be quite Has changed china ke purv netritv ke ulat shi ne march, 2013 main pad sanbhaalane ke baad apane nazariye se satta par pukhta chhap chodi he
 He has taken full command of the party, government and the army and has completely centralized the decision making process
 apane desh main shi kaa sandesh he “chini raashtra kaa mahaan punarutthan
 "he took a tough stand on corruption and insisted on forming a strong and clean government
" videshi morche par ve nae damakham se labarej china kaa sandesh de rahe hai yani deng shiyaoping ke us naare ke din ab lad gaye ki “sahi samay kaa intjaar karo, apana dam chhupaae rakho
 In the last 12 months in Xi's plan in India, Xi's government made it clear that the idea of "economic zones and silk routes" is not limited to mere talk
 sarkaar kareeb 100 arab dollar kaa khajaana teji se taiyaar kar rahi he
 The $ 40 billion Silk Road Fund will help the new Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) formed with the support of China
 silk road pariyojna se hi spasht ho jaataa he ki china kaa nayaa netritv duniya main apane desh ko kis sthaan par dekhnaa chahta he
 That is, China will emerge as a major economic and geopolitical force in the region
 isamen bharat kii jagah aakhir kahaan hogi? darasal, china ke videsh niti ke ranneetikaron ke dimag main america he, na ki bharat
 According to China's foreign policy experts, the Silk Road initiative is in many ways part of an effort to reduce America's economic and strategic dominance in Asia
 sarkari santhaan china institute for contemparari international relations (siisiiar) main centre for south, south east asia ke nideshak hu shisheng kehete hai, “abhi america kaa asia-prashanth kshetra main prabhutv kaayam he
 If China's economic zone and road construction project comes to fruition, it will reduce America's dominance conditionally
 ”china ne jis teji se aarthik kshetra or road nirmaan pariyojna&or khaskar eiibi&par kaam aage badhaayaa he, usase in maamalon ke jaankaar bhi hairaan hai
 America's attempt to boycott this bank failed and it fell alone
 vah haath malataa rah gaya or uske sahyogi britain se lekar dakshin korea or australia tak ne china kii samaysima ke bheetar bank ke sansthaapak sadsy banane ke liye hadabadi dikhaai
 a Western diplomat in China's capital says, "AIIB is a big diplomatic victory for Beijing
 america akelaa hi haath malataa rah gaya
 "xi himself gave a similar impression in his first major speech on foreign policy at the Asia Security Summit in Shanghai in May last year
 unhone asia main asia sanchalit nae kshetreey suraksha tantra ke nirmaan kaa aahvaan kiya
 Xi stated clearly, "the people of Asia have to see the arrangements of Asia
" ” lekin beijing kii samasya yah he ki yah bhaavana puure asia main har desh main jaahir nahin ho rahi
 Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam have been alarmed by the rise of China and these countries have moved closer to the US
 khaskar in teen deshon ke maamle main china ne samudri vivaad main kadaa rukh akhriyaar kiya he
 There is also a reason that he thinks America is provoking them
 bich kaa deshbharat-china dwipaksheeya sambandhon kii apni ahmiyat he lekin china ke liye bharat ko apane saath banaae rakhana america se jari uski hode kii jarurat ke taur par bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 In an interview, Chinese officials and experts said that they do not think a "strong leader like Modi" will allow India to become the pawn of any country "
 haalanki kuch chiniyon ko dar he ki modi bharat ko washington or tokyo ke kareeb liye ja rahe hai
 This apprehension is also reflected in China's haste to make India a founding member of AIIB and partner in the Silk Road project
 eiibi kaa sansthaapak sadsy banane kii peshkash ko to bharat ne sweekaar kar liya, lekin silk road main saajheedaar banane ke prastaav par vah kuch satark ravaiya apana rahaa he
 Further details of this project have been sought from India
 china ne bharat ke saath seemaa vivaad par bhi kuch alag rukh akhriyaar kar rakhaa he
 It has taken a very tough stand against Japan and the Philippines, while the indo-china border dispute is showing some soft stance by calling it a burden of the past
 asal main china main bharat ko ek myne main pratidwandvi se adhik kshetreey dabadabe ke liye america se takkar main bich kaa khilaadi mana ja rahaa he
 That is, a country with which China will maintain a complicated relationship of cooperation and competition, but it also believes that India is an important player in maintaining its territorial dominance
 masalan, bharat vaishvik vyapaar sandhiyon, vittiya sansthaanon main sudhaar or jalwaayu parivartan par pashchim kaa dabaav ghataane main china kaa upyogi sahyogi ho saktaa he
 Huyang Shelian, deputy director-general of the Asia Department at China's foreign ministry and chief in-charge of India-related disciplines, says China views its relationship with India in terms of "not decades, but thousands of years"
 ve kehete hai, “ateet main ham saath-saath oonch-neech, sahaj or asahaj daur se guzar chuke hai
 We think that we now have a chance to revive our two great civilizations
 ”siisiiar ke hu kaa maananaa he ki china agar asia main apni badi bhoomika sthapit karnaa chahta he or shi ke nazariye ko saakaar karnaa chahta he to use bharat ko shartiya taur par apane saath lekar chalane kii jarurat he, vah bharat ko aisi sthiti main nahin chhod saktaa ki vah apane pados main china kii yojanaon ko lekar sashankit bana rahe
 He says, "it is better for China to strike such a balance in its cooperation with India that India feels relaxed, it accepts China
" agar bharat silk road se alag rahata he to koi baat nahin lekin bharat agar usamen rode atakata he to samasya hogi
 i do not think India will do that
 ”modi-shi samikarnamodi ke china daure ke pehle china ke videsh niti visheshgyon ke saamne sabase badi gutthi yahi he ki bharat or china main do dashakon main pehali dfa do majboot netaaon ke ubharne kaa kya asar hoga? puraane mahal ke vishaal angan main sthit asardaar think tanks chinis piples institute for fahrren afares ke mukhiya, purv rajanyik yang venchang bataate hai ki pichhali baar jab donon deshon main baari janadesh ke saath do netaa satta main pahunche the to bharat or china apane puraane seemaa vivaad ko sulajhane ke kareeb pahunch chuke the
 He said, “I personally hope that only two strong leaders can solve this problem
 1980 ke dashak ke aakhri varshon main ek rajanyik ke naate main gavaah hum ki pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi or deng (jo khud bhi ek majboot netaa the) ke saamne samasya ke samaadhaan kaa ek mauka tha
 Deng said, "we make some compromises on the west side, if you bow down on the east side, our borders may be new
" ” hamane apni ore se peshkash bhi kii lekin pradhanmantri gandhi koi jawaab nahin de sake
 "but not everyone in Beijing agrees
 ek purv rajanyik kehete hai, “do majboot netaa vivaad kaa samaadhaan kar sakate hai lekin do majboot netaa yah bhi nahin chahenge ki apane ghar main samjhaute karte dikhen
 Therefore it is difficult to say that a solution can be found
 ”modi kaa bharat shi ke ganit main kahaan makul baithta he, yah is par nirbhar karegaa ki donon netaa sambandhon ko kis had tak aage le jate hai
 Will there be any major changes in the limited relationship with doubts? Hu of CICIR says, "we have seen progress in the construction of industrial parks, high speed rail tracks
 vaaki yah badi pragati he
 Your Prime Minister has said that India and China are like one soul, two bodies
 yah kaaphi utsahvardhak or mahatvapurn bayaan he
 The Xi government believes that it is very important to maintain a solid relationship with India
 vyaktigat rup se meraa maananaa he ki aane vaale varshon main koi badi aadchan nahin aane vaali he kyonki donon hi desh vikaas par jor de rahe hai or is makasad ke liye donon ke hi bich kaaphi kuch saajha he
 From our side, i believe that we would like to take full advantage of Modi's strong government
 isamen do raay nahin ki yah ek bada rajnatik mauka he or ham yah bhi ummid kar rahe hai ki modi duusare kaarykaal ke liye bhi bade aaraam se chunaav jeet lenge

 Call it a juggernaut of space in media reports or an honest plea made in the temples of justice of the common citizen in the world's largest democracy, raging at the falling level of public rhetoric

 Describing himself as a 'common citizen' by this rude rhetoric, the trend of dragging him to court by filing complaint petitions against celebrities of both sides has been gaining momentum

 City lawyer Inderjit Singh Bhatia has recently dragged two key members of Team Anna, Prashant Bhushan and Kiran Bedi, to the court through separate complaint petitions
 bhaatia ne kaha ki unhone yah kadam isliye uthaaya, kyonki bhushan or kiran ke pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke khilaaf ati aapattijanak upamaaon ke istemaal se vah ek aam naagarik ke rup main aahat hai
 The complainant claims that these non-parliamentary addresses for Manmohan not only humiliated an important constitutional post like the Prime Minister, but also damaged the credibility of the entire democratic system of the country
 unhone kaha, ‘maine adaalat se guhaar kii he ki vah pradhanmantri ke apmaan par bhushan or kiran ke khilaaf sambhddha dhaaraon main mukadmaa chalaane kaa aadesh de
 Bhatia has also filed a complaint petition against Ramdev, calling the mps a 'dacoit and murderer'

 On the other hand, the supporters of Anna are also not ready to bear the 'insult' of their leader and they are taking shelter of the court in the same style

 Chishti had approached the court by filing a complaint petition against Tiwari as well as Congress President Sonia Gandhi over the alleged derogatory remarks on Hazare
 haalanki, jaisaa ki chishti khud bataate hai ki ek pratham shrenee nyaayik magistrate kii adaalat unki yachika khaarij kar chuki he
 But he has not given up at the moment and he is considering to move the High Court in this matter
 unhone jor dekar kaha, ‘congress pravaktaa ne hajaare kii chhavi dhoomil karne ke liye un par jhuthe iljaam madhe the

: 044-42121778 gujarat main somvaar ko ahmedabad or surat samet sabhi kapadaa udyog se jude bazaaron ne ek din kii hadtaal rakhi
 a day-long shutdown was held to protest against the two percent extra excise duty imposed on the textile industry in the budget
 ek anumaan ke mutabik gujarat main kareeb 11,000 garment manuphaccharer hai or kareeb 4 lakh log is vyavsaay se jude hue hai
 Gujarat Garments Manufacturers Association says that by the time a cloth is made, it comes through about 13 to 14 different places
 banane se lekar rang auki alag-alag hisson kii kataai or phir silaai jaise kaamon main alag-alag karigar isse jude hue hote hai or ye vyavsaay puri tarah se asangathit he
 In such a situation, the excise duty applicable at all these levels will be about 8 to 10 percent on a product
 pehle hi ye udyog thodi mandi jhel rahaa he auki agar mahangaai or bad jaaegi to isaki dikkatein or zyada bad jaaengi
 The head of the Gujarat Garments Manufacturers Association, Vijay Purohit, says that with the addition of one more department, corruption will increase immensely
 jab jab inspector raaj aayaa he bhrashtachar or badha hi he
 Arpan Shah, the secretary of the association, says that if anyone really makes Modi ji's formula Make in India meaningful, it is the textile industry
 aise main agar kapadaa udyog behaal hua to sarkari sapane bhi puure nahin ho paaenge
 According to an estimate, after agriculture, the textile industry is the highest in the country, employing about 11 crore people
 tippaniyan It is important that jewelers have been opposing the 1 percent extra excise duty on gold and silver jewelery continuously for the last 12 days and are on an indefinite strike across the country to oppose it
 isse ab tak is vyapaar ko kareeb 72,000 karod rupee kaa nuksaan ho chukaa he
 It is important that the opposition of Narendra Modi government's budget is being most vocally in his home state of Gujarat
 pehle johariyon kii hadtaal, jise heere ke vyavsaay ne bhi sampurna samarthan diya auki ab garment udyog bhi is virodh main jud gaya he
 According to an estimate, there are about 11,000 Garments manufacturers in Gujarat and about 4 lakh people are associated with this business
 gujarat garment manuphaccharer association kaa kahana he ki ek kapadaa banakar taiyaar hota he tab tak wo kareeb 13 se 14 alag-alag jagahon se hokar aata he
 Different craftsmen are involved in the work of making and cutting of colors and different parts and then sewing, and this business is completely unorganized
 aise main 2 pratishat exise duty in sabhi staron par lagu hote hote ek utpaada par kareeb 8 se 10 pratishat tak padegaa
 First of all, this industry is facing a slowdown and if inflation increases further, its problems will increase further
 gujarat garment manuphaccharer association ke pramukh vijay purohit kaa kahana he ki ek auki vibhaag bad jane se isamen bhrashtachar behad bad jayega
 When Inspector Raj has come, corruption has increased
 association ke secretary arpan shah kaa kahana he ki modi ji ke sutara mek in india ko agar koi sachmuch sarthak karata he to wo he kapadaa udyog
 In such a situation, if the textile industry is unhappy, then the government's dreams will not be fulfilled
 ek anumaan ke mutabik desh bhar main krishi ke baad kapadaa udyog hi sabase zyada, kareeb 11 karod logon ko rojgaar detaa he
 The comments mahatvapurn he ki sona-chaandi ke gahanon par 1 pratishat atirikt exise duty kaa virodh johari pichley 12 dinon se lagaataar kar hi rahe hai or iskaa virodh karne ke liye deshbhar main bemiyadi hadtaal par hai
 This has caused a loss of about Rs 72,000 crore to the business so far
 mahatvapurn he ki narendra modi sarkaar ke bajet kaa virodh sabase mukhar tareeke se unke griharajya gujarat main hi ho rahaa he
 The first jewelers strike, which was also fully supported by the diamond business, and now the garment industry has also joined this protest
 pehle hi ye udyog thodi mandi jhel rahaa he auki agar mahangaai or bad jaaegi to isaki dikkatein or zyada bad jaaengi

 Before the completion of 50 days of the announcement of demonetisation and before the Prime Minister's address to the nation on Saturday, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has asked five questions to Narendra Modi
 rahul ne yah sawaal kiya ki aath november ko bade noton ko amaanya karne kii ghoshnaa karne ke baad kitna kalaadhan jabt kiya gaya he or is nirnay ke kaaran kitni naukariyaan khatm hui hai
 The Congress vice-president asked the Prime Minister who he consulted with before making this decision and wondered why experts, economists and RBI were not consulted
 congress upaadhyaksh ne yah jaananaa chaha ki aath november kii notebandi kii ghoshnaa se pehle chah maheene main kitne logon ne khaaton main 25 lakh rupee se adhik jamaa kiye
 Rahul Gandhi said, '50 days of the announcement of demonetisation are over, the country is waiting for your answer on these five questions, Modiji
 rahul ke PM modi se sawaal1-8 november 2016 ke baad kitna kalaadhan jabt kiya gaya?2-is nirnay ke kaaran desh ko kitna aarthik nuksaan hua or kitni naukariyaan khatm hui?3-notebandi ke kaaran kitne logon kii maut hui? kya in logon ko muaavja mila?4-notebandi ko lekar pradhanmantri ne kin kin logon ke saath vichaar vimarsh kiya?5-8 november 2016 ko notebandi ke nirnay se pehle chah maheene main kin kin logon ne bank khaaton main 25 lakh rupee se adhik raashi jamaa kii?notebandi kaa mukhar virodh karne vaale rahul gandhi pehle hi is nirnay ko duniya ke itihaas main achaanak kiye jane vaala sabase bada aarthik prayog bataa chuke hai
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has done a masterstroke before the general elections
 rahul ne somvaar ko kaha ki congress satta main ai to desh ke 20 fisadi garibon ko nunatam aay kii guarantee dene vaale ek badi yojana NYAY (nunatam aay yojana) ko lagu kiya jayega
 Under this, about 25 crore people will be guaranteed a new income of Rs 72,000 every year
 salanaa 72,000 rupee kaa matlab he ki har maheene kam se kam chah hajaar rupee die jaaenge
 This scheme is being considered as a means of better income guarantee than the most ambitious scheme of the Congress so far
 gauratlab he ki kisaanon or garibon ko lakshith kar congress kii kai yojanaayen pehle bhi safal rahi hai
 The most ambitious scheme so far is the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA)
 iske alaava kai rajyon main congress kii karjamaafee yojana ko bhi safal mana jaataa rahaa he
 Comparing the minimum income guarantee scheme to the MNREGA, the 72,000 rupees under NYAY is equivalent to 172 to 338 days of employment (according to the states) at an annual minimum wage
 yahi nahin ucch str ke kushal shramikon kii baat kii jaae to bhi yah nunatam veg par 132 se 254 din ke rojgaar ke baraabar he
 In this way NYAY can actually prove to be a better income guarantee scheme than MNREGA
 manaregaa ke vipareet isamen kisi tarah kaa kaam karne kii baadhyataa nahin he or har garib ko yah rakam milegi
 Employment guarantee of only 100 days in MNREGA
 haalanki, isamen bhi ausatan salanaa 40 se 45 din kaa hi rojgaar miltaa he
 3 annually on this ambitious plan of Congress of 3 lakh crores total subsidy of Modi government
 6 lakh karod rupee kharch hone kaa anumaan he, jabaki modi sarkaar kii kul sabsidi kareeb 3 lakh karod rupee kii hi he
 In the 2019-20 budget, the total subsidy on food, fertilizer and petroleum is about Rs 3 lakh crore
 iske alaava shiksha par yojana vyay 94,000 karod rupee kaa tay kiya gaya he
 a budget of Rs 75,000 crore has been set for the PM Kisan Cash Transfer Scheme
 centre sarkaar kaa swasthya bajet kareeb 61,000 karod rupee kaa he
 Rahul Gandhi told that every year 20% of the people of the country will be ensured to get at least Rs
12,000 per month income under this scheme, aimed at alleviating poverty
 unhone kaha ki narendra modi desh ke amir logon ko dhan de sakate hai, to congress party garib se garib logon ko 72,000 rupee kyon nahin de sakati
 Rahul Gandhi said on Monday that the plan is ready and it is entirely viable financially
 iske tahat paanch karod pariwaron yaa 25 karod logon ko is yojana kaa laabh milegaa
 Describing this idea as great, Rahul Gandhi said that those who earn less than Rs 12 thousand, we will ensure that their income reaches 12 thousand rupees per month
 unhone kaha ki congress sarkaar satta main ai to yah yojana kai charnon main lagu kii jaaegi
