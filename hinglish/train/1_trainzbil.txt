 There was unease in the indo-nepal relations regarding the new constitution of Nepal when the Government of Nepal called the Indian Ambassador and raised the issue of "obstruction" in the supply of essential commodities from India
 bharat ne bhi aaj ek baar phir ‘‘vishwasaneey or asardaar’’ tareeke se is desh kii ashaanti ko dur karne ke liye dabaav banaaya
 Nepal's Foreign Minister Khaga Raj Adhikari called Indian Ambassador Ranjit Rai as hundreds of protesters opposing the new constitution blocked key business check posts along the indo-nepal border
 sutron ke anusaar, raay ne nepali netaa se kaha ki avrodh nepal kii taraf kuch virgon dwaara ashaanti, andolan or pradarshan ke kaaran he
 The comments khaas baat yah he ki isse pehle aaj bharat ne nepal se ‘‘vishwasaneey or asardaar tareeke se’’ vartmaan shanti ke kaarnon se nipatane ko kaha
 The officer summoned Rai to the Foreign Ministry here and discussed the current situation at the border check posts
 mahendra bahadur pandeya sanyukt raashtra mahasabha kii baithak ke liye america main hone ke kaaran adhikari kaaryvahak videsh mantri kii bhoomika main hai

 6 saal kaa tha
 If someone had died, he was discharged early in school
 ghar aayaa to dekha
 g VCP (video Cassette Player) and Color TV were ordered at night
 wo abhi tak rakhaa he
 Some movies and decided to play among the elders
 film chali maine pyaar kiya
 The first thing remembered is the pigeon
 hamaare yahaan to nire bure se dikhte sileti kabutar hote the
 But Bhagyashree, who was in a colorful suit, had a white pigeon in his hand
 sundar sa
 And there was love
 nahin nahin
 Salman Khan
 usamen sabane apane matlab kii baaten khoj leen
 Brother said
 dekha, ek haath se puddp karata he
 We saw prem dadhikate hue ga rahaa he
 Aaja came in evening
 shaam to nahin aati
 But a nugget of Mogre definitely tilts towards him
 cycle chalaanaa bhi fashneble ho saktaa he, ye tabhi janaa
 Now when Salman is riding a bicycle in Kik, it may be a reminder of Gandhiji in this Dhoom era, but now there is a revival of the market
 aaj ye sab yaad aa rahaa he kyonki aaj salmaan khan ko silsilewar or eemaandaar dhang se unki cinemai chhavi ke tahat samajhane kii koshish kar rahaa hum
 Just returned seeing the kick
 haul main utsav sa maahaul tha
 Three sisters-in-law wanted to decide everything from snacks to status updates before the film started
 ladakon ke giroh ke giroh, jatthe ke jatthe gir rahe the
 Those who had reached earlier, they were applying the terra to those who came later, as if they had reached with a garland for the Mother's Jagrat
 padhein salmaan khan kii film kik kaa rivyukai kapal the or kai hiran
 Those who are called stags outside the pub and Bapu are counted separately for entry
 sabko nihaar rahaa tha or phir film ko dekh rahaa tha
 This was the beginning of a double journey
 rah rahakar puraane salmaan khan elbum bhi khul rahe the
 i must have seen many films after Pyaar Kiya
 par hamen yaad rahi kanpur ke bade bas stand ke saamne manjushri tokies main hafton chali ham aapke hai koun
 Only you could hear about it at that time
 haul main jaakar pikcharen dekhne kii manaahi thi tab
 But when i later saw the film on CD, i saw so many times that leave the scarf and remember the color of the sofa
 vahaan se prerana mili ki salmaan khan kii tarah achche insaan bano
 Love the brother, the family
 sharaarat bhi karo
 But one should also play a ramatula
 taaki ladies sangeet main heroin us par naach sake or phir aap par nisaar bhi ho sake
 But till then the people of English medium were destined to learn guitar
 ham hindi medium vaale bas is bare main sochate the
 Then he came up with a song from Jeans making dentured shorelines from Ughare Badan and Blade
 oo jane janaa
 Arvind Mills turned twelve
 bhai log raf and taff or new port kharidte
 The wearer would later get stabbed and sit before piercing his backyard
 ham hai skool main the
 Jeans did not come in jewelery until then
 magar paper dene ke baad is gane vaali film pyaar kiya to darana dekhne gaye
 Didn't learn guitar and jeans
 magar ye siikhaa ki betaa body honi chahie to salmaan jaisi
 Decided that the penalty started as soon as the paper was over
 intermediat main pahunche to sansar kii sabase sundar aurat ko parde par dekha
 Aishwarya Rai scratches the grass with wet soil in the pool
 ham dil de chuke sanam main rangeen kandilon ko raushnee bakhshati aishwarya raay
 And our Salman Khan fell in love with it
 laga ki ye to pariktha jaisaa kuch ho rahaa he
 We were happy for Salman, Aishwarya and myself
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki ye rishta hamen bhi ek yakeen de rahaa he
 There will also be some Aishwarya in your horoscope, which will be found after showing bravery, as the feeling was awake
 ek or chhavi tank he is daur kii
 The name of the film was Bandhan
 usamen ek seen tha
 Salman Khan's thigh had the villain sneak a secret
 or bhai use puure jor se nikaal rahaa tha
 Kaisa was becoming a beautiful image like Kalidas's metaphor at that time
 deh deh nahin rah gai thi
 Graffiti was created
 barason ke shram se sundar bani
 But then the twist came in the story
 salmaan bura ho gaya
 Like we get bad after inter
 cigarette, sharaab, sex, jhagada, paisa, igo, ghar waalon se takaraav, jaise tamaam panch maathe par takatakaane lagate hai
 Salman gave up the car
 salmaan ne hiran maar diya
 Salman also allegedly duped Aishwarya on the go
 laga ki sab kuch bura ho gaya he
 Like you are screaming screaming haa main aisa hi hum
 Hate me phir film ai tere naam
 All the Diljle of the locality who tolerated the tattoos in the earlier era, carved their name with blades and wax
 achaanak nai kii dukaan ko hikaarat se dekhne lage
 Radhe woke up inside them and her hair grew to be five feet long
 sabakaa ek hi makasad tha
 Protecting an angel that looks like a flower
 usase baar baar dutkaar paanaa or aakhir main use ye ehsaas karana ki dekho
 You were wrong main bura dikhataa hum
 But i am not gundai karata hum
 But inside i am good
 usee dauraan jati kaa ek kadava sach bhi saamne aayaa
 When we wanted to grow our hair, we were shocked
 kaha gaya
 Long hair keeps goons and miscreants
 dekha nahin peeche ke mohalle main jahaan suar paalak sampradaay ke log rahete hai
 How to have long hair and wear bright colored t-shirt
 gale main steel kii chen dhaaran karte hai
 Salman's class distinction was also understood from here
 jo gunde hai, mawali hai
 Sadistic striyon kii izzat nahin karte
 Salman Khan is the same
 or jo dost banate hai
 Climbing ladders bring flowers and chocolate, and whistling on the day of Valentin
 ve shahrukh hote hai
 And at that time, Aamir was busy in collecting rent, so he did not even consider it
 radhe bhaiya phej beetaa or kariyar ke dabaav main salmaan peeche chhootane laga
 Understood if something settled
 charm to asal bane rahane main he
 To remain desi
 or tabhi dabang ai
 It felt like Salman was reborn
 mitti ke bartan, karadhani, pandey ji kaa padnaa, pita se jhagada, kameez ke batan kii tanki, bhindi kii kataai, sab kuch surila lagane laga
 Salman Khan, who has suffered six consecutive flops, made a comeback from Dabangg's debut film Wanted
 varna to kai log unka marsia pard hi chuke the
 Dabangg re-stamped his stardom
 chandigarh main log piviar main siton par naach rahe the sallu kii entry par
 And after this the creation of the myth named Salman Khan started
 katrina caff ai gayi
 People felt that brother helped in his career
 yahi naam badhane ke baad aage bad gai
 This was the phase of the dominance of the Surur of Being Human
 salmaan paras ho gaye
 His fanfare became a matter of pride
 ready jaisi filmein bhi 100 karod ke paar hone lageen
 Whether or not Salman Khan comes to acting, it could be a boast
 magar virdohi bhi maanenge ki unhen dance aata he
 But Salman's dance is not classical
 lok he
 He democratized the dance
 kabhi tauliya, ko kabhi collar to kabhi mahaj genes kii pocket main hathiliyon kii chonch nikaal step bana diya
 The thumb stuck in the belt became Ada
 baad main maharaja or ganesh band kii besur dhunon par reshmi kadhai vaali kaaler dhaaran kiye muhalle ke ladakon ne ramesh thekedaar kii ukhdi sadak par lot lot inke deje varjan bhi nikaale
 During this time, stories of not only Salman's charity, but also his bodyguards, his new actors started developing
 or phir shahrukh khan kii english chikanahat ke viruddh achaanak se desi boij ko ek latth mil gaya
 Pilar Saw Solid
 log jahaan tahaan shahrukh khan main, unke fere and handsam taur tareekon main
 In his acting
 unki harkaton main aib khojane lage
 He felt that Shah Rukh was no longer his style by singing well, dancing well, wearing good foreign clothes
 ab ye wo moti naak or saawali rangath vaala shahrukh nahin rahaa jo kikiki kiran kahata tha or apni buraaiyon ke saath hamaare paale main aa khadaa hota tha
 Now it was polished
 ab ye wo villen tha, jiskaa zikr ranjhna main kundan karata he
 We kept on loving and these btech MBA took our love of our neighborhood
 shahrukh ud gaya or hamen kinare paan kii dukaan par apni anth ke saath khadaa salmaan khan mil gaya
 He did not care about the media, critics, acceptance of beautiful girls
 sab kuch apane alabele dhang se karata tha
 And then this thread flashed in the mind
 ladkiyaan aamir khan sa dost, shahrukh khan sa pati chaahati hai
 But he wants a lover like Salman Khan
 handsam, aakraamak, pakizgi se bharaa, deewangi se bharaa
 Loved to the extent of cynicism
 kabhi bechaara, to kabhi ataarkik or aakraamak
 Now Salman Khan has become a school
 kik main unki entry hoti he
 Shocks and Jacqueline falls and rests on her shoulder
 public ko lagata he ki unke hisse main bhi bahaar aa gai he
 In this film, Salman's screen image, public image are so embedded in the story that we feel that this film is an extension of all the incarnations and concepts of Salman Khan
 nayak aage badhata he or uski motorcycle ke agle tair par dhadaam se ek baraat main tutaturi bajaata banda girtaa he
 He does not see Salman or Devi Singh
 use dabang ke pandey ji dikhte hai
 This is the fantasy within fantasy
 jo darshak ko baqayada aagaah karti he
 Do not forget that you have been crazy about the legends he is doing
 ye salmaan khan ek adarsh pitrusattamak vyavastha kaa poshak he
 India that loves it is also like this
 ye salmaan kabhi sharaab nahin piega
 If you drink, drink for some purpose
 ye heroin ko zyada chhuegaa choomegaa nahin
 Like a good Indian cultured boy, everything will be saved for the inside of the room
 ye gundon se heroin ko bachaayegaa
 Will spread goodness maa-baap kaa har haal main kahana maanegaa
 Often the men of this country want to be like this
 taqatvar
 One who gives a befitting reply to evil
 aurat jati kaa rakshak
 That is why when the goddess sees that some goons are teasing girls in a restaurant, her kick wakes up
 wo pehle un mardon ko thapedta he jo tamaasha dekh rahe hai
 After public awakening, goons are to be fed
 us dauraan ladakiyon se mukhaatib he salmaan
 The turquoise colored brasslet rotates
 majaak main baat karata or bich main ardhviram kii tarah baaju ghumaakar buraai ko jameen par lutaata
 The princely states of many sapphires see the prince at that time
 ye salmaan ladakiyon ko pasand he, aisa baaju vaali ladki ne bataaya
 Then another form of it appears
 jab wo desi daaru ke haq main bolta he
 Such as the color, spit, sneeze, foot, pungi of the trunks descends to the allegedly uncouth and clumsy levels
 kuch kuch dwiarthi bhi ho jaataa he
 Those little ones who are young, they connect their strings at that time
 unhen bhi jid ho jaati he
 The girl accepts me including my bad form
 ‘ham sand hai’ kii takhti lataka lete hai ve
 But notice
 ye vahi ladke hai jo shahrukh nahin ho paae
 Those who got pink slip
 pink lips nahin
 And then Salman creates a dream for him with his sweetheart
 becoground main gaanaa bajataa he
 Your love story is difficult
 kabhi kaale, ko kabhi sarson vaale pile libaas main lipati katrina, karina, jaclyn ankhon ke saamne tair jaati hai
 In front of them is a flower dropped on the road from the idol of the deity
 salmaan he
 There are hurt boys
 jo apane paurush ko lekar aashwast hai, magar kabhi ek reshmi scorf kii chhuan ko lalayit the
 These statements could not be done in two words
 ve yakeen karte hai
 Like Salman's day turned around to us
 or iske liye kya karnaa hoga
 Evil also has to be used for good
 duniya sharaabi, jhagadaalu salmaan par baat karti rahe
 But he will promote Being Human
 big bos main budtamiji karte logon ko tivi parivaar ke saamne prem ban daantega
 Will give a brasslet to a driver
 kisi bodyguard ko ghadi de degaa
 And on hearing the news of this transaction, many people will be filled with more attachment towards their brother
 unke liye salmaan kik main gaata he
 Love love openly
 khullamakhulla kaa ye sandesh or saahas salamaanon ko divya lagata he
 They see a man who is running away from the police
 baari trek par savaar hokar
 But when a woman is seen crossing the road with her child in front
 to devil kinare ho jaataa he
 Love comes out trek kii raftaar sust ho jaati he
 Lives of life
 magar ek nanhee jaan batch jaati he
 Then finally Sanaka is drawn into the video game
 saamne gunde hai
 Salman is wildly beaten by them
 jaise hamaari video game ke remote par angaliyon kas gai hon
 Like in the last stage, the demon sitting slow will die for us
 ham aage badhate jate hai
 Attahs are considered a challenge
 or ant main jeet jate hai
 Salman Khan taught us to win with our evils
 tamaam civillined, sabhy, chikinahat bhare narm tareekon ko taj kar
 And that's why majority of the boys and many girls of this country have a relationship with Salman Khan
 salmaan hamaari damit ichchhaaon kaa roopak he
 Which has all the abilities
 magar phir bhi aishwarya, katrina ko lutaaya pyaar kinaaraa nahin paa paata
 Family is there, but not quite our own family
 kute kute hai
 There is a cause in life
 bas nahin he to kuch bhi normal jaisaa
 If it is like a shameless plant, then the past thrives again
 jaise hamaare saath hota he har dam
 And in the midst of all this, this mantle, when it becomes Jai, Devi or Prem robs the evil
 acchon kii madad karata he, to ham kuch behatar kuch halkaa mahasoos karne lagate hai
 This is being Salman Khan
 salmaan sir par savaar hai
 But there is one more thing when the hymn is remembered, remember
 ye vakt bhi biit jayega
 It is obvious that even Salman Khan will pass away like this
 bachi rahengi muskuraahaten
 Of being human
 chalate chalate ek joke bhi sun lijie
 Academ is fresh
 kik 2 main salmaan khan mar jayega
 Because when he takes a bicycle in front of the train, the bicycle will leave
 wo dab jayega
 Hey brother till then Modi ji's bullet train will come
 hamaara nahin he
 Whats app isliye iske liye tarif yaa gaaliyon se na navaajein
 Take a kick
 den
 Just talk
 id mubarak

 shahar kii ek adaalat ne purvi dilli main dhahi imaarat ke maalik amritpal singh ko do din kii police hiraasat main bhej diya he
 At least 67 people have died in this accident
 metropolitan magistrate bhavani sharma ne kaha ki kathith imaarat ke swaamitv sambandhi dastavejon kii baramadagi ke liye aaropee se hiraasat main poochtacha karnaa jaruri he
 Therefore, the application seeking to send the accused to police custody for two days is accepted
 imaarat ke maalik se hiraasat main poochtacha karne kii maang karte hue lok abhiyojak ne kaha ki haadase main ab tak 67 logon kii maut ho chuki he
 Documents have to be recovered to ascertain various facts related to this building
 aaropee ko gita colony se giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 a case has been registered against him under Section 304 (culpable homicide) of the Indian Penal Code
 use adhiktam umr kaid kii sajaa ho sakati he
 However, the counsel for the accused said that a case can be registered against Amritpal Singh only under Section 304 a (death due to negligence) of the Indian Penal Code, which carries a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment
 agar ve usee raste chalate rahe jiske liye jane jate hai, to ho saktaa he ki navjot singh siddhu ko phir se punjab main congress ko chhodkar kisi nae rajnatik ghar kii talash kerani pade
 Sidhu has been in constant tussle with Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh since the Congress won 77 seats out of a total of 117 in the Punjab Assembly elections in February 2017
 tab se lekar ab tak, is purv cricketer ne aamtaur par sanyat rahane vaale mukhyamantri ko bahut naaraaz kar liya he
 Badbole Sidhu is known for bypassing the 'chain of command' and has direct access to Congress president Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi
 jald hi rajya kaa pratishthit sthaneey prashasan vibhaag unase chhina ja saktaa he
 Amarinder Singh told India Today, "his responsibilities have to be redesigned
 shahari [vidhansabha] kshetron main kharaab pradarshan ke kaaran hamaare haath se bathinda or gurdaspur kii seat nikal gai
 "for example, in Gurdaspur, Congress candidate Sunil Jakhar lagged behind in most urban areas while in rural areas like Dera Baba Nanak, Fatehgarh Churian, Batala and Kadian, he had an edge over film actor Sunny Deol
 party ke andruni sutron kaa kahana he ki kai congress vidhayak lambey samay se party ko yah sanket de rahe the ki siddhu kaa mantralay shahari kshetron main acha pradarshan nahin kar paa rahaa jisase 'matadaataaon kaa mohabhang' ho rahaa he or chunaav main vahaan mushkilen aa sakati hai
 But his alleged 'failures' are not the only problem
 rajya ke ek varisht congressi netaa kehete hai, ''siddhu ek santulit congressi nahin ho sake hai kyonki unamem ve gun bhi nahin hai
 "his gesture was towards some of the last few incidents of Sidhu being extremely sentimental in public and sometimes sarcastic on the party leadership and ultimately ashamed of the party collectively
" cabel tivi par kar lagane (unhone badal parivaar se jude ek network ko nuksaan pahunchane ke liye aisa kiya tha); alaabhakaari ret khanan niti par jor dene; or kathith rup se rajya kii sharaab (utpaada shulk) niti ko apane tareeke se tay karne kii unki khwaahish ne amarinder sarkaar ke shuruaati daur main hi mushkilen khadi kerani shuru kar di thim
 Later, during the swearing-in ceremony of Imran Khan as Prime Minister in August 2018, Sidhu publicly hugged Pakistan's Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa to open up a new front of troubles
 1965 kii bharat-paak jang main hissaa le chuke sena ke purv adhikari amarinder isse khush nahin the
 a few months later, Sidhu also attended the Kartarpur Corridor program in Pakistan
 is dfa ve anjaane main hi lahore main gopal singh chawla jaise swayambhu khalistaani netaa ke saath galabahiyaan karte hue dikhe! congress ke andruni sutron kaa maananaa he ki unke in kaamon se party kii chhavi ko dhakka lagata he
 "after the Pulwama attack, his hug from General Bajwa became a snuggle in our throats," says a party leader
 ''punjab main siddhu kaa sankshipt pravaas unke liye nai mushkilen lekar aayaa
 Despite several requests from Congress candidates contesting the election, Sidhu kept distance from his home state and reached Punjab for campaigning on May 17, the last day of the election campaign
 bathinda main unhone us din kai chunavi jansabhaayen kii or unki gugli ne sambhavat: congress ke paanch pratyaashiyon ko hit wicket kara diya
 The iconic seat of Bathinda where Harsimrat Kaur Badal, wife of Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Badal, was contesting the election, Sidhu accused Amarinder of colluding with the Badal family! And, Captain Amarinder Singh does not tolerate this impudence

 Arhan Khan, Shefali Bagga and Madhurima Tuli entered the show last week
 unke sho main aate hi nae-nae drame or twist dekhne ko mil rahe hai
 At the same time, Arhan Khan has proposed Rashmi Desai in the show
 sho main unka lav angel dikh rahaa he
 At the same time, Shefali Bagga believes that this love story of Arhan and Rashmi is fake
 rashmi-arhan kaa rishta phek he?buudhvaar ko aae episod main shefali rashmi se kahati hai ki unhen lagata he ki rashmi or arhan kaa rishta phek he
 Actually, Arhan and Shefali are sitting together
 shefali arhan ko kahati hai ki agar vaaki agar wo rashmi se pyaar karte hai to unhen sho main rashmi se shaadi kerani chahie
 Arhan takes this as a joke and says that if it happens, it will be recorded in the history of Bigg Boss
 aage shefali kahati hai ki agarahanshadi ke liye taiyaar bhi ho jate hai to rashmi shaadi nahin karengi or meraa andaja sahi sabit hoga
 So Arhaan says it is not so
 isi bich rashmi bhi vahaan aati he to shefali rashmi se puuchhati hai ki kya tum arhan se shaadi karogi
 So Rashmi says on this, we are now understanding each other
 abhi hamen ek-duusare ke prati feeling kaa ehsaas hua he
 So Shefali says i think your bond is fake
 khayr, rashmi or arhan apane rishte par muhar laga chuke hai
 Both shows are seen holding each other's hands
 donon ek-duusare ko baby kehete hai

 com / gh4nlyb6ub samaajawaadee party or mulaayam singh yadav ke parivaar main chal rahi kalah thamane kaa naam nahin le rahi
 The party and the family seems to be completely divided into two groups
 ab hamale bhi aamane-saamne khulkar ho rahe hai
 On Saturday, a series of meetings were held for reconciliation, but the result did not come out
 ab rajyasabha saansad ramgopal yadav ne sapa kaaryakartaaon ko chitthee likhakar akhilesh virodhiyon par hamalaa bolaa he
 In this letter, Ram Gopal Yadav has written that the attempt to reconcile is a conspiracy to stop Akhilesh's journey
 kaaryakarta akhilesh ke saath juten
 Akhilesh will not reach the anti-assembly
 ramgopal ne saath hi likhaa he kiakhilesh kii yatravirodhiyon ke gale kii fans ban gai he
 Arbitrators are trying to confuse
 jahaan akhilesh hai, jeet vahiin he
 Important things about Ram Gopal's letter Ram Gopal Yadav has written that we want a socialist government to be formed in the state whereas he (shivpal and his supporters) wants Akhilesh to lose the election
 hamaari soch positive he, jabaki unki soch negative he
 Ram Gopal has written that along with Akhilesh are those who have sweated blood for the party, endured insults, while the people from there have been those who have earned thousands of rupees, committed adultery and misused power
 pehle mulaayam ko likhi chittheeramgopal ne isse pehle mulaayam singh ko bhi ek chitthee likhi thi
 It has been written in the letter that not to put forward Akhilesh Yadav as the face of the Chief Minister will have to weaken Akhilesh
 aisa karnaa party ke liye bada nuksaandaayak sabit ho saktaa he
 Ram Gopal Yadav has further written in his letter that at this time Akhilesh needs your strong support
 unhone kaha he ki akhilesh ko siem chehre ke taur par aage nahin karne se kaaryakartaaon or party cader main kanceyujan failega jo hit main nahin he
 Earlier on Saturday, seeing the rebellion of Akhilesh Yadav, Mulayam Singh Yadav sent five senior party leaders Revathiraman Singh, Beni Prasad Verma, Mata Prasad Pandey, Naresh Aggarwal and Kiranmay Nanda to convince Akhilesh Yadav, but the meeting remained inconclusive
 Has gone
 akhilesh kii naaraazgi se machi khalabalidedh ghante chali is baithak ke baad akhilesh yadav ne in netaaon se kaha ki unke pita mulaayam singh yadav aaj kal bete se zyada amar singh par bharosa kar rahe hai
 Akhilesh Yadav said that he is not ready to bow down until the issues raised by him are resolved
 akhilesh yadav ne yah bharosa bhi nahin diya ki party or pita kii izzat bachaane ke liye 5 taarikh ko ho rahe samaajawaadee party ke rajat jayanti samaaroh main wo hissaa lenge
 Akhilesh will not attend the party's anniversary celebrations! There are also reports that Ram Gopal Yadav will also not be present in Samajwadi Party's 25th anniversary celebrations at Janeshwar Mishra Park in Lucknow on 5 November
 akhilesh yadav yah bilkul nahin chaahate ki vah party ke lakhon kaaryakartaaon or netaaon ke saamne amar singh ke saath manch saajha karen
 Akhilesh called meetingparty Chief Mulayam Singh called a meeting of party leaders and office bearers on October 24, a day before Akhilesh Yadav called a meeting of all office-bearers, district heads and mlas and indicated the dispute would escalate

 49-year-old Gillard was administered the oath of office and secrecy at the Government House in Canberra by the first female Governor General of Australia, Quentin Bryce
 swasthya , shiksha or jalwaayu parivartan par red kii nitiyon kaa virodh kar rahe lebar party ke sadasyon ke bich gilard sarvamaanya netaa ke taur par ubhari hai
 Gillard said that he had asked his colleagues to change leadership because "I believe a good government is deviating from the path"
 ’’ unhone chetavanee di ki swasthya or shiksha sevaayen tathaa kaarysthalon par samaan vyavhaar agle chunaav main bada mudda honge
 After being sworn in, Gillard said he was not a "political novice"
 unhone ek majboot tathaa jimmedaar sarkaar kii aguwai karne kaa daawa kiya jo austrailia ke bhavishya kii kaman sanbhaalengi
 Gillard took over as deputy prime minister during Rudd's prime ministerial term after the Labor Party recorded a landslide electoral victory in 2007
 madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri kamalnath ke bhaanje ratul puri ke khilaaf iskar vibhaag ne badi karrwai kii he
 The Benami Prohibition Unit of the Income Tax Department has seized assets worth Rs 254 crore of Ratul Puri and his firms
 ratul puri par rajeev saxena kii madad se epadiai ke rup main paisa bharat laane kaa aarope he
 The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has accused Ratul Puri of receiving scam money in the agustawestland VVIP helicopter deal case
 bhartiya vayusena ke liye 12 viviipi helicopteron kii kharid ke liye anglo-italvi company agasta-westland ke saath qaraar kiya gaya tha
 This agreement was worth Rs
3,600 crore in the year 2010 but was canceled by the Government of India in January 2014
 aarope he ki is qaraar main 360 karod rupee kaa kamishan diya gaya tha
 Ratul Puri's name also came up in this case
 haalanki maamle main aaropee se sarkari gavaah bane rajeev saxena ne poochtacha main ratul puri ke naam ko chipa liya tha
 Recently a shocking incident took place in which Ratul Puri secretly opted out of the ed's inquiry to avoid the Enforcement Directorate (ED) interrogation
 agency ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki shuukravaar ko agasta westland viviipi helicopter sauda maamle main puri se poochtacha chal rahi thi, is bich unhone jaanch adhikari se vashroom jane ke liye chuttee maangi, lekin vah vahaan se bhaag nikle
 When he did not reach for questioning, the agency officials called him on his mobile but the phone was switched off
 film rivyuu:zanjeerdirector:apurv lakhiyaector:priyanka chopra, raamacharan teja, sanjay dutt, prakaash raaj, chetan pandit, maahi gilduration:do ghanta 17 minutepaanch main sedo star(**)1
 If you are a fan of the 1973 film Prakash Mehra's Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bhaduri, Pran and Ajith starrer film Zanjeer, don't watch the remake of Zanjeer released today, will be disappointed and curse this remake culture without drinking water
 pehali zanjeer main sab kuch asal or yaad rah jane vaala tha
 But this is not the case with Nai

 The new chain is like the first line of posters pasted on the walls of the towns a few years ago, with an all-india great performance, full of action, romance, suspense and action
 magar dikkat yah he ki in saare eliments main kuch bhi nayaa nahin he
 Songs have been pummeled like a vegetable that was forgotten weeks before when kept in the fridge
 kahani ke twist kaa ek balak bhi andaja laga saktaa he
 There is no acting, because there are stars in the film and those who are actors, were not even acted
 padhein film shuddh desi romance kaa rivyuu3
 The film's story is almost a copy of the actual chain in the first half
 inspector vijay ab asipi vijay khanna ban gaya he
 Is angry and does not want to see justice dancing like squads at crossroads
 transfar se mumbai pahunchataa he or ek murder ke silsile main bhidata he tel mafia teja se
 He is helped and then loved by the eyeglass garland of Katal, Sher Khan, the king of stolen cars and journalist Jaidev
 dharmik katha kii tarj par ant main paapi kaa naash hota he
 And on the lines of Hindi films, this story is just the victory of Bahubali Hero riding on the chariot of emotion
 4
 The film's hero Ramcharan Teja is said to be the superstar of Telugu films
 jaahir he star hai, to acting par kam or dole dikhaane, cheekhney or kadam thirakaane par zyada jor rahata hoga
 He does not show any emotion in the role of Inspector Vijay Khanna in Zanjeer
 ek tanaav, krodh or nishchay jisase milakar vijay bana hoga, nadaarad rahata he
 Teja Ji, your character was not seen in this role
 5
 Priyanka Chopra garland has been made, but Chakku does not sell knives here
 gujju enarai hai, fasebuk friend ke biyah main thirakane or bollywood style india dekhne ai hai
 After that, she becomes an eyewitness to a murder, clashes with Vijay and first falls in fear and then in love
 jab vah darati hai to lagata he ki kamedi sarkas kaa koi kirdaar dar rahaa he, taaki agle pal hansaa sake
 Priyanka had already said in the interview that if there was a mistake, then forgive
 jaao maaf kiye tumhaare ye sab khun darling
 6
 sher khan ke role ko praan aasmaan kii bulandiyon par le gaye the
 In the new chain, Sanjay Dutt does not do anything like that, but does not spread on the floor to everyone else
 kuch suja hua sa cheharaa or ankhen, pathaanon jaisi bilt, chehre par cat mark or kai jagah se katkar taraashi gai dadhi or sher dil javaanon sa rob jachataa he
 But in the last, his character becomes weak
 qawwali sikvence bhi chori ke maal jaisaa hi he
 7
 prakaash raaj behad shandaar actor hai, ye ham bhaag milkha bhaag main dekh chuke hai, jahaan vah beraham magar mamata se bhare piti instractor bane hai
 We have seen this as a villain, in Jayakant Shikre of Singham
 magar zanjeer main teja ke role main vah bebas se najar aate hai
 The reason for this is the insistence of the new directors that they are willing to show a good potential villain to act like a buffoon
 teja chamkile, bhadkile rangon main ranga ek vidooshak najar aata he, jiske paas dhokhe se kuch takat aa gai hon jaise
 8
 maahi gil ne mona darling ke role kaa naash maar diya
 She seems to meow all the time, just pulling her Teja Seth to bed
 villen kii yaar main ek jo maheen, kaatil chamak honi chahie, vah nadaarad he
 He is another example of spending an actor unnecessarily
 9
 Atul Kulkarni plays the character of Jaidev
 is dauraan vah film pej 3 ke krime reporter vaale role ko aage badhaate dikhte hai
 His role is clearly inspired by the famous crime reporter Jay Dey who was killed in Mumbai a few years ago
 atul theatre becoground se hai or is tarah ke role unke liye aasaan hi hote hai
 Chetan Pandit also appears to compensate for the average work of the rest in the role of Police Commissioner
 10
 The music of the film is gap filled and the direction is very poor
 diarector apurv lakhiya kaa josh bas kuch eksha sikvence main hi najar aata he
 Talking about the rest of the story, the story of Zanjeer was strong
 magar behatar hota ki apurv don or agnipath ke rimek se kuch sabak lete or time mashin ke faasale ko tay karne se pehle apana homework achche se karte
 The songs of the film do not touch the soul from anywhere
 har vakt asal zanjeer ke yaari he imaan meraa, banaake kyun bigaada re or diwane hai diwaanon ko na ghar chahie
 
 
 Keep remembering or ant menfilm main kai chijen samaj hi nahin aatin
 Villain had killed the father of the hero, so the hero has scary dreams, but the horse does not understand why
 isi tarah aakhri main villen ke marate vakt muharram jaise dharmik shahadat ke parv ko dikhaane kii bhi vajah samaj nahin aati
 If there is a film in Mumbai, what have i sworn to do for the scene of Ganesh Visarjan
 kya desh ke saare musalmaan apane tyoharon par qawwali karte hai
 Does every police department have two stupid and forced inspectors trying to make them laugh like Aamir Nazir of Krush Singh around the hero
 zanjeer kii ye rimek film ausat masaalon se las he, agar yahi hindi cinema he aapaki najar main to jaakar tadap dur karen
 Varna has more films except being trapped in this chain
 bhartiya janata party ne pradhanmantri manmohan singh se desh main lagaataar ho rahe aatanki ghatnaon ko rokane main naakaam rahane kaa aarope lagaate hue naitik aadhaar par unka istipha maanga he
 BJP President Rajnath Singh said that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government has completely failed to stop the growing terrorist incidents in the country and they should be resigned immediately on moral grounds
 gauratlab he ki pichley chah maheenon andar ahmedabad, bangalore, jaipur or dilli ko aatankwaadiyon ne bam dhamaakon se hilaa kar rakh diya he
 26 people died and around 100 were injured in serial blasts, one after another in Delhi
 in sabhi dhamaakon kii jimmedaari indian muhaahidin ne lee he
 It is believed that the Indian Mujahideen is another name of the banned outfit SIMI

 chennai metro ne us sikh yuvak se maafee maangi he jise chennai metro ke karmchaariyon ne pagadi utaarne ko kaha tha
 a Sikh youth had claimed that he was asked by the Chennai Metro security personnel to take off the turban at Vadapalani station
 29 saal ke ejeeniyar tandeep singh ne fasebuk par likhaa ki 31 agast kii raat ko metro stesan par surakshakarmiyon ne unhen roka
 After doing all the investigations, the security guard pointed to my turban and asked to remove it

 But they were not ready to listen to me
 iske baad maine unke suparvizer ko bulaayaa, jinhone baad main mujhase maafee maangi or mujhe bina pagadi utaare yatra karne diya

 Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh has accused the BJP government of Madhya Pradesh for not fulfilling most of the promises made since the 2003 assembly elections
 singh ne ek baatcheet main kaha ki bijepi ne kisaanon ke pachaas hajaar rupaye tak ke krishi rin maaf karne kaa vaayada pichley chunaav main kiya tha, lekin ab tak us par amal nahin kiya he
 Not only this, in the 2003 Assembly elections, he also promised to improve the condition of roads, electricity and water in the state, but the situation today is well known
 unhone kaha, ‘bijepi ne pichley do vidhansabha chunaavon main janata se anek vaayade kiye, lekin uski sarkaar in sabhi morchon par vifal rahi he or aashcharya kii baat to yah he ki ab bhi vah pradesh ke vikaas kii baat karti he
 The Congress General Secretary said that the government is making big claims regarding the Atal Jyoti Abhiyan, but farmers are not getting electricity for farming and the non-agricultural consumers of the villages are also abusing the government on the claims of providing power round the clock
 It is because there is darkness in the villages
 unhone kaha ki rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ko lekar unke us bayaan kii kaaphi aalochana kii gai, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki aresas bam banane main sanlipt he, lekin unki yah baat baad main sach sabit ho gai
 In response to a question, Singh said that he does not want to contest the Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections to be held in November this year, but if the party says it will want to contest next year's Lok Sabha elections
 pradesh main hue piemti ghotaale kaa zikr karte hue unhone kaha ki farjivade ke jariye yahaan anek ‘munnabhai’ embibies paathyakram main ghus gaye hai
 The situation is that meritorious students from poor families have not been able to get into medical colleges and ineligible children from rich families have been admitted

 is hamale ke 4 din biit chuke hai phir bhi abhi biguef or suraksha agencia ise naakaam karne main vifal raheen hai
 Whereas before the new year, an intelligence alert was given by the Ministry of Home Affairs
 mantralay ne aagaah kiya tha kiatankvaadeeis baar punjab ko nishaanaa bana sakate hai
 After this, questions are now being raised on the preparedness of Punjab Police and SP Salvinder Singh of Gurdaspur, who was abducted by the terrorists for some time
 sena kii vardi main aae aatankighatana ke baad puurepunjab main alertjari kiya gaya
 Even the Jammu Police kept a watch on the situation
 jin paanch logon ne espi ko agava kiya tha, ve bhi sena kii hi vardi main the
 Salvinder Singh and his friend Rajesh Verma had told that they had heavy weapons
 inhone espi kii car chhini or usase 20 kilometre tak gaye
 Then took another Innova train, which left him in a village in Himachal Pradesh
 espi salwinder akalgarh main mili or yahaan se teen kilometre dur taxi driver ikagar singh kii laash mili
 If the SP is not able to find those who kidnapped the SP, it was a conspiracy to attack the Pathankot airbase for a year
 police ne base camp kii jaankaree pakistan tak pahunchane ke aarope main 30 agast, 2014 ko army ke jawan sunil kumaar ko arest bhi kiya tha
 However, this matter was not taken seriously due to which the terrorists managed to execute such a big incident
 chandigarh main punjab police ke ek purv sheersh adhikari ne kaha ki aisa lag rahaa he ki khoj or talaashi abhiyaan halkaa tha, kyonki suraksha bal 24 ghante baad bhi aatankwaadiyon ko nahin khoj paae
 In the face of the suicide attack, Theatanki came in army uniform and managed to sneak inside the wall of the Airforce station at around 3 am on 2 January
 ye aatanki do tukadiyon main airforce stesan main daakhil hue
 One troop went towards the residential area and the other towards the technical area
 sutron ke mutabik ye seemapar se aae the
 These terrorists were seeking suicide attack
 lekin jab hamale ko anjaam dene main naakaam rahe to aatankiyon ne pehle grenade phenke or phir javaanon par firing shuru kar di
 These include lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammed terrorists
 NSG commando kii maut par bhi sawalis oparation ke 4 din biit jane ke baad or sena ke 7 javaanon ke shahid hone ke baad biguef or khufia agenciyon kii karypranali par sawaal uthne lage hai
 The incident of martyrdom while defusing the bomb of NSG commandos raised questions over the entire operation
 haalanki dephence ke logon kaa kahana he ki special suut pahanane ke baavjood kai baar bam diphyus karte samay jaan chali jaati he
 Because special suits also have a limit
 raahil sharif ko thi pathankot hamale kii jaankaree!pathankot main hue aatanki hamale ke bare main ek bada khulaasa hua he
 It is learned that the Pakistani army chief k Raheel Sharif was already aware of the attack
 bhartiya khufia agenciyon ke mutabik, pakistani sena vahaan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif ke shanti vaarta ke prayaason se puri tarah sahamat nahin he
 On the other hand, Pakistani agencies engaged in the investigation, Pakistan has officially admitted that it has received some inputs from India
 bataaya jaataa he ki pakistani agenciyaan bhartiya input ke aadhaar par jaanch main jute gai hai
 The Modi government wants to see how much Pakistan is keen on talks and renewed friendship with India and whether the government there fulfills its promise
 PAK kii pratikriya ke baad hi vaartamodi sarkaar se jude sutron ne bataaya ki bharat dwaara saajha kiye gaye input par pakistan kii pratikriya or karrwai hi yah tay karegi ki aage is maheene donon mulkon ke bich videsh sachiv str kii vaarta hogi yaa nahin
 The source said, "if Pakistan moves seriously towards this and takes action against the culprits of Pathankot, India will consider it a positive sign for mutual relations
" 'punjab main chah maheene main doosraa bada hamalaayah chah maheene main punjab main doosraa bada aatanki hamalaa he
 Earlier on 27 July 2015, there was a terrorist attack in Gurdaspur
 tab bhi aatanki pakistan ke raste hi aae the
 They entered the Dinanagar police station and hid in the building next to the police station and kept firing
 yah muthbhed 12 ghante chali thi
 Gurdaspur SP was martyred in this
 aise bachaa bada hamaline aatankiyon ko airforce stesan ke gharelu kshetra main hi roak diya gaya tha
 They did not manage to reach the technical field
 takneekee kshetra airforce stesan kaa sabase zyada suraksha vaali jagah hoti he
 After the attack, a high alert was issued all over Punjab
 pathankot main nakaabandi kar di gai
 Security outside the Airforce station has been increased

 shanivaar subah, matganana prarambh hone ke pehle samaajawaadee party ke kaaryakartaaon ne jeet kii kaamana karte hue havan kiya
 By then, the life-size cutout of Rahul Gandhi, planted with Akhilesh Yadav, was removed overnight
 yaa to kaaryakartaaon ke bich congress ko lekar naaraazgi thi yaa ve buree takadir ke pahalu ko dhyaan main rakhte hue koi chance nahin lenaa chaah rahe the
 However, this step also did not prove to be good for the Chief Minister
 congress ke saath 'bekaam ke gathbandhan' ke alaava akhilesh ko chunaav ke kuch hi samay pehle apane pita ko sahaayak kii bhoomika main bhejne ke faisle par sochna hoga
 After the election, he had spoken of returning the post of party president to father Mulayam Singh, who he had captured with the support of thousands of party workers
 vaise, pita ke saath apane vivaad ke dauraan akhilesh kii pahchaan safasuthari chhavi vaale aise yuva rajaneta ke rup main bani jo aparaadhik chhavi vaale logon, mafia don se duuri banaakar rakhata he
 Joking about his party's election symbol, Akhilesh said, 'our bicycle was tubeless
 ,aise main hamaare liye yah lagbhag asambhav tha ki ham iske pahiyon main hawa bhar pate
 ' haalanki ve, gangrape sahit kai aapraadhik maamalon ke aaropee gayatri prajapati jaise daagdar ummidavaar kaa prachaar karne se khud ko dur nahin rakh paae, lekin zyaadaatar samay akhilesh kii logon ke bich acchhee chhavi rahi
 He was widely acclaimed for developing world class highways and focusing on the education of youth
 haalanki badlaav or vikaas ke maseehaa ke rup main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii chhavi ke aage ve tik nahin paae
 His bicycle staggered and fell
 unke pita ke paas ke ab yah bataane kaa mauka he ki training wheels ko bahut jaldi hataane kaa kya parinaam hota he
 Though he could not keep himself from promoting tainted candidates like Gayatri Prajapati, accused of many criminal cases including gangrape, Akhilesh has a good reputation among the people for most of the time
 vishwa stareey haive ko viksit karne or yuvaaon kii shiksha par dhyaan dene ke liye unhen kaaphi prashansa hasil hui
 However, he could not stand in front of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's image as the messiah of change and development
 unki cycle dagamagaakar gir gai
 His father now has a chance to explain what is the result of removing the training wheels too soon
 sansad ke bajet satr kii kaarywahi anischitkaal ke liye sthagit hone se pehle dalon ke netaaon ke paaramparik sambodhan ke dauraan mulaayam singh yadav ne yah bhi kaha ki hamaari kaamana he ki jitne sadsy is sadan main hai, sabake sab ek baar phir lautakar aaen
 Members of the ruling party cheered on this statement by thumping the tables
 Samajwadi Party's Mulayam Singh Yadav in Lok Sabha: PM ko badhaai dena chahta hun ki PM ne sabko saath lekar chalne ki koshish ki hai
 Main kehna chahta hun ki saare sadaysa phir se jeet kar aayen, aur aap (PM) dobara pradhan mantri banein (file pic) pic

 com / reeyh5h9bb Mulayam Singh Yadav thanked Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan for his work and also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said that the Prime Minister has worked closely with everyone
 sabko saath lekar chalane kaa prayaas kiya he
 He said that we congratulate Prime Minister Modi and wish us to become Prime Minister again
 yadav ne ye baaten ek se zyada baar kahin or is dauraan sadan main upasthit pradhanmantri narendra modi ne haath jodakar unka abhivadan kiya
 In the matter, PM Modi also expressed his gratitude during his address
 udhar, mulaayam singh yadav ke is bayaan ke baad congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha, "main mulaayam singh yadav se sahamat nahin hum, lekin raajnneeti main unke yogadan kii kadra karata hum
 
 
 " sarkari swaamitv vaali esampisiiel kii sthapana 2006 main kii gai thi, jo noton kii chapai, sikkon kii dhalaai or gaiyr-nyaayik stamp paper kii chapai kaa kaam karata he

 vahiin mysore or salboni sthit chhapekhanon kii kshamta 16 arab note prati varsh he
 (input from IANS) haal tak janata party ke adhyaksh rahe or ab bijepi main shaamil hokar gandhi parivaar par hamalaa kar rahe varisht netaa subramanyam swami ne somvaar ko kaha ki haa, narendra modi kii shaadi hui thi, magar unki marji ke khilaaf
 However, when this news was spread in all the media one after the other, Swami made a tweet on Tuesday afternoon saying that his statement being made on Modi's wedding is wrong
 khabaron ke mutabik swami ne kaha tha ki ki yah sach he ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi shaadishuda hai, magar vah iske liye raji nahin the or unhone parivaar waalon ko pehle hi kah diya tha ki agar aap jabaran meri shaadi karvaa bhi denge, tab bhi main apni patni ke saath nahin rahoonga
 Swami said these things during a private program in Agra
 unase patrakaron ne congress ke purv kendriya mantri jarnadan pujari ke modi kii marital states sambandhi chalange par sawaal kiya tha
 Swami tweeted and said, "I am right on Sonia, Swami tweets a partial refutation of his statement on Modi's marriage to Galtamodi
" swami ne twit main likhaa he ki haa, main agra main ek kaarykram main shaamil hone gaya tha
 During this time, the questions i raised on Sonia Gandhi's past are correct
 magar modi kii shaadi ke silsile main meraa jo bayaan bataaya ja rahaa he, vah galat he
 i did not say anything like that
 somvaar ko digvijay singh ne bhi aaj tak se khaas baatcheet main apni maang doharaate hue kaha tha ki bijepi ke piem candidet narendra modi ko desh ko yah saaf-saaf bataanaa chahie ki vah shaadishuda hai yaa nahin
 Diggi had said that Yashoda Ben, who is working as a teacher in Gujarat, is said to be suspicious of the BJP about the fact that she is the wife of Narendra Modi
 sonia shaadi se pehle landan main kya karti thim?modi kii shaadi par apana rukh bayaan karne or phir usase mukarne ke alaava swami ne sonia gandhi par ek baar phir hamalaa bolaa
 He said that the Congress which questioned Modi should tell what work Sonia Gandhi used to do in the country adjacent to London before marriage? After this, Sonia's son Rahul Gandhi came to Swami's target
 ravivaar ko dilli main hui congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii raily kaa zikr karte hue unhone kaha,‘rahul kii raily main kiraye kii bheed laai jaati he
 When that crowd started going on Sunday, then Chief Minister Sheila Dixit folded her hands and said that stop, Rahul ji's speech has yet to happen
 iske baad bhi janata nahin rukii, to rahul ko apana bhaashan chota karnaa padaa
 Anyway, Rahul has nothing new to say

 " Producer director Sanjay Gupta is currently busy shooting for the film 'jazbaa' along with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan
 khabar he ki vah apni film 'kaante' kii sikwel bana sakate hai, sanjay dutt ke reeha hokar aane ke baad
 According to the news, whenever he met Sanjay Dutt in the past, he thought of making a sequel

 It is the responsibility of the government to provide social security to every person, but the elderly Ram of India is confident
 inaki sankhya bhi badhati ja rahi he par aise bujurg muflisi main jivan gujaarne ko majaboor hai jo sarkari naukari main nahin the yaa jinhen pension nahin milti
 The central government provides a pension of Rs 200 per month to an elderly person
 11 saal se is raashi main koi parivartan nahin kiya gaya he
 But 5 state governments have added it on their own till 2000
 bada sawaal ye he ki kya bujurgon ko sarkari skim kii madad mil rahi he, or agar mil rahi he to unki sabhi jaruratein is madad se puri ho rahi hai? kyonki aankade sochane par majaboor karte hai
 10 in the country according to the 2011 census
 38 karod varisht naagarik hai
 India's population has almost doubled in the last 50 years, but the number of elderly people has increased more than 4 times

 Now to make you aware of the reality, the Central Government gives financial assistance (old age pension) to the elderly above 60 years, the full name of this scheme (indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension)
 lekin kitni rakam milti he jab ye aap janenge to hairaan rah jaaenge? centre sarkaar aaj bhi maatr 200 rupee maheene ke hisaab se bujurgon ko pension kaa bhugtan karti he
 In fact, in the year 2007, for the age group of 60-79 years, the monthly pension amount under this scheme was kept at just Rs 200
 usee samay yah raashi bahut kam maani gai thi, jabaki 80 varsh se adhik ke aayu varg ke liye pension 500 rupee rakhi gai thi
 But the surprising thing is that 11 years passed after that and the central government did not increase it
 mahangaai ke hisaab se dekhen to saal 2007 main tay kiye gaye 200 rupee kii keemat aaj maatr 92 rupee hi rah gai he
 The amount received as old age pension is distributed by the state governments through the commendable efforts of these states
 or is pension raashi main adhikansh rajya sarkarein apni ore se dhanrashi jodatii hai, jahaan ve adhik dhanrashi jodatii hai, vahaan vruddh nagarikon ko apekshaakrit adhik pension mil jaati he
 With the help of the State Governments in Goa, Delhi, Kerala and Haryana, pension gets around 2000 rupees
 supreme court ne lee classdusri ore kuch rajya aise hai, jahaan sarkarein apni ore se bahut kam dhanrashi jodatii hai or vahaan ke varisht nagarikon ko abhi tak 500 rupee se bhi kam kii pension milti he
 Such states are Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Manipur
 wo to bhala ho supreme court kaa, jisane pichley dinon centre sarkaar se is maamle par gambhirtha se vichaar kaa aadesh diya
 Currently, there has been a demand to increase this amount to Rs 3000
 iske alaava kuch or yojanaayen varisht nagarikon ke liye hai, jo is prakaar hai
 Vay Vandana Yojana Modi government started this scheme with special attention to the elderly
 haal main sarkaar ne pradhanmantri vay vandana yojana (piemvivivai PMVVY) ke tahat nivesh seemaa ko doguna kar 15 lakh rupee karne ko manjuuri di
 This will increase the social security cover of senior citizens
 saath hi is yojana main nivesh seemaa do saal badhaakar 31 march, 2020 kar diya gaya he
 PMVVY is for citizens 60 years and older
 isse yah saaf he ki is yojana main agar koi 15 lakh rupee kaa nivesh karata he tab use yojana jari rahane tak 1 xxrep 4 0 rupee har maheene pension milti rahegi
 What is PMVVY? PMVVY is a pension scheme for senior citizens 60 years and above
 is yojana ke tahat varisht nagarikon ko masik pension vikalp chunane par 10 varshon ke liye 8 fisadi ke guarantee ke saath ritern kii vyavastha kii gai he
 If the annual pension option is selected then 8 for 10 years
 3% kii guarantishuda vaapasi hogi
 The government has brought this scheme together with LIC
 rashtriya vayoshri yojnasaal 2017 main centre sarkaar ke dwaara garibi rekha se neeche guzar-basar karne vaale varisht nagarikon ke liye rashtriya vayoshri yojana kii shuruyaat kii gai
 Under this scheme, the government provides hearing aids and wheelchairs including age related accessories free of cost to senior citizens
 kaise or kise milegaa laabh?is yojana kaa laabh 60 saal yaa usase adhik umr ke bujurg uthaa paaenge
 Also, his name must be from BPL category
 is yojana main bujurgon ko aaramdaayak juute, baisakhi, kritrim daant, wheelchair, shravan yantra, chashma, trypod, locomotor asamarthta se nipatane vaale yantra samet anya upkaran muft main die jane kaa praavdhaan he
 More interest on savings schemes Senior citizens get more interest in savings schemes

 Talk on sex is not possible in India
 us desh main, jisane duniya ko kamasutra diya
 The country that engraved the Maithuna postures on the walls of the temples of Konark and Khajuraho
 aaj bharat kii aabaadi 1
 21 billion
 yah duniya kii sabase teji se badhati jansankhya he
 Nevertheless, sex is inappropriate and prohibited here

 She was very happy, said: "if you had a father today, you would be very happy
 '' phir joda, ''or vahaan tumhaara kaam kya hoga?'' ''mujhe condom par kaam karnaa he
 "" What? "" They were shocked
 tauba-tauba karke unhone phone rakh diya
 Now she will face those friends and friends and relatives who will question about this new job of mine? How would my poor mother feel? i knew that the trust is going to change the perception of condoms in the next two years in the campaign that will face similar situations
 abhiyaan shuru hua to logon kaa badalata hua ravaiya dekhne ko mila
 At the very beginning, i met a woman who shocked me
 ve meri antee se har nazariye se behad alag thim
 She was from Satara, a small district in Maharashtra
 ve hamaari condom 'paheli' pratiyogita kii vijetaon main se ek thim-unhone us 'paheli' ko hal kiya tha, jiskaa jawaab 'condom' shabd tha
 She had traveled a considerable distance with her husband to Mumbai for the award distribution ceremony
 unhone puraskaar ke rup main ek sundar-sa mobile phone haath main liya, or mujhe dekhakar sharmaate hue muskaraayi
 i asked, "will you tell everyone how you got this award?" She openly said with a smile: "there are two opinions in this too! Condom is, after all, just a word
 ''do mahilaayein, or donon ke nazariye main jameen or aasmaan kaa fark
 But when it comes to sex, then the readers reading it will see innumerable and many other colors between these two perspectives
 pichley kuchhek varshon main in vishyon par kuch kaam kiye hone ke naate mujhe tamaam pravritiyon ko jaananaa, vyavhaar-bartaav ko udhedakar samajhna or puri parakh ke liye anveshan karnaa tha
 Like any other work in India, this work is also very complex, so complex that it cannot be imagined
 par yah bojhli or ubaau kabhi nahin ho saktaa
 There is something good and boring in sex
 solah se 18 saal ke (shahari, e / bi / si shrenee ke) logon main jokhim kii sambhaavnaaon kii thaah lene ke liye aktubar 2009 main bibisi dabluasti-pikuar ke ek gunatmak adhyayan se kuch dilachasp tathy saamne aate hai
 (ages 12 to 20) Teens increasingly want to 'grow up'
 isliye nahin ki ve jimmedaariyaan baantnaa chaahate hai, balki isliye ki unhen vayaskta main zyada masti or aazaadee dikhti he
 They want to be 'adults' and their parents realize this
 aise main maa-baap or bachche ek barabari kii jameen par aa khadey hote hai
 Growing children are given more freedom to do as they please
 or isi ke saath kuch or aazaadiyaan unhen hasil hoti hai
 For example, money, mobile phones, social networks, relationships and careless attitude towards sex
 surakshit sex ko kisi bhi or baat kii tulana main garbh thaharne se bachaav ke rup main zyada dekha jaataa he
 In addition to other illustrative sources of just superficial sex education and learning, especially from the Internet, most respondents to the study claim that their parents do not talk to them 'about all this'
 do saal baad, surveykshan main pataa chalata he ki aise abhibhavak, jinka kam se kam ek baccha 18 saal se kam kaa he, main se lagbhag ek-chauthai sochate hai ki unke bachche sex kii drushti se sakriy hai
 Most of those who think so, simply accept this truth
 lekin aise bhi abhibhavak hai, jo ise niyati maan lene kii bajaae sex sambandhi masalon par bacchon se baat karte hai or unhen shikshit karte hai
 Naturally, mothers do so more than fathers (21 percent compared to 10 percent of men)
 sex survey 2011: yuvaaon ke man ke andar kii batbees saal se kam umr ke in bacchon kii tulana inase thodi-si badi umr ke un purushon or striyon se kiijie, jo rahane, padhane yaa kaam ke silsile main ghar se nikalakar kahin or aa gaye hai
 Their life has not been any less easy than the Internet (even when you do not have an iphone, you still sit in front of the computer) but the challenges they face are much heavier
 pichley do-ek saal main antarjaateey vivaahon par khap panchayatein baithi, apharan or hatya hui hai, sex ke junun main aparaadh hue hai or balaatkaar ke maamalon main khaasi teji ai he
 Whether they are half-hearted teenagers or young men and women around the city of 20, they are caught in a vortex of ambiguous guidelines, conflicting social traditions, rooted prejudices, loose law implementation machinery, and complex hypocrisies
 
 par yah koun kahata he ki is mulk main sab kuch ekatarfa dhang se chalata he? kuchhek saal pehle kii baat he
 The broadcast of a radio advertisement was stopped because it used the word 'condom'
 vah surakshit sex kaa prachaar kar rahaa tha, is baat kii koi ahmiyat hi nahin
 It became more important that he was seen promoting 'freedom'! But in 2008–09, in a campaign run in collaboration with the National AIDS Control Organization, condom ringtones without any instruments became extremely popular
 duniya main aisa pehali baar kiya gaya tha or ek saal ke bheetar use downlod karne ke kareeb 8,00,000 aagrah mili
 Whether you like it or not, it is appropriate or not, but that word was present in the middle of the public
 jo use chokhi or mjedaar cheez maanate the, un logon ke mobile par vah shauk se baj rahaa tha
 Yes, he was causing inconvenience to those who made a mouth about him
 yah jaananaa dilachasp hoga ki yah kaise kargar hoti he
 (or does not occur)
 yah vahi mulk he jahaan item number ko manyata mili hui he

 There is no lack of sex in our life
 lekin agar aap liv-in relationships main hai, to aapako kiraye par jagah paane main kaaphi samasya kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 If a condom drips from the pockets of the unmarried son, then no mountain will break on seeing it, but if the same is found with the unmarried daughter? Problem
 shaadi ke pehle ke sex or svachhand sansarg ke liye bharat main purushon or striyon ke liye alag-alag niyam hote hai
 Actually the results of the survey here reveal your perceptions of intuitive understanding
 yah anumaan lagaana koi badi baat nahin ki shaadi ke pehle sex abhi bhi koi sweekrut cheez nahin he
 58 percent of the respondents are against pre-marital sex and its opposition is more among women
 isi se miltaa-julata yah nishkarsh bhi he ki 60 fisadi se bhi zyada uttardaataaon ko liv-in relationships ko sweekaar karne main samasya he
 It is no surprise that in Bangalore, with a young, urban technical education population, there are relatively more acceptors
 yah jaanane ke liye bhi koi bahut dimag lagane kii jarurat nahin he ki (74 fisadi) maa-baap samalangik bacchon ko sweekaar nahin karenge
 Till date i have been able to meet only one mother who took her children to the gay-pride March in Delhi recently
 sex tak badhati pahunch ko bhatakaane vaala mana jaataa he
 Who is to be blamed for this? Women of course! a woman is considered to be the root of all problems
 aadhe se zyada uttardaata maanate hai ki vivahetar sambandhon kii ghatnaayen zyada vivaahit mahilaon ke baahar nikal kar kaam par jane ke kaaran bad rahi hai
 It is no surprise that this idea is more popular among men than women; The same men who dream about sheila-munni etc
 or ise dekhie, yah tukkebaaji nahin: ek doosraa mahatvapurn nishkarsh yah he ki mahilaon kii tulana main purush fantasiyon main zyada jite hai
 More than 20 percent of men claim to have had sex with money - the highest number being in Hyderabad (31 percent) and Mumbai (20 percent)
 lihaaja yah koi aashcharya kii baat nahin honi chahie ki kareeb do saal pehle do yuvatiyon ko lekar bane ek radio vigyaapan ne halchal machaa di thi or iske bare main akhbaar main chap gaya tha
 One of them is heard talking about going on a date
 yah dating sex ke bina hi khatm ho gai thi kyonki us jode ke paas condom nahin tha
 Thankfully, despite the critics, the ad was not broadcast and safe sex prevailed
 ve din gaye, jab pyaar main phool ek-duusare kii taraf uchhaale jate the or bollywood ek chumban ke saath romance puraa kar letaa tha; jab khuleam ek duusare ke haath pakad lenaa logon kii naaraazgi kaa sabab banataa tha; jab raat ke 10 baje ke baad tak ruknaa ek yuvati kii pratishtha dhoomil kar detaa tha
 Today, sex is trying to create an understanding of where it should be or live - onscreen or in the open
 sex aakhir kitna 'sexi' he? yah tamaam khaasiyaton vaala sabase nayaa smartphone he, yaa pichley jamaane kii filmon main dikhaai gai clasik abhinetri kii taangon jaisaa? koi thos jawaab nahin hai, kabhi ho bhi nahin sakate
 You will find both my aunt and Satara woman with their own changing thoughts
 duniya kii sabase teji se badhati jansankhya ke liye sex ek bahu-aiami, shandaar, rahasyamay kaccha hira he
 It reflects a never-changing puzzle-india, through which the picture of this puzzle becomes different

 ajmer main tanga hi shahari yatayaat kaa ek maatr saadhan tha or taange kii dar bhi chavanni-athnni prati sawari hua karti thi lekin asumal kisi bhi keemat par apni sawari ko le jane se nahin chukte
 They also agreed to leave two-three annas per ride from the railway station to the dargah
 javaani ke dinon main asumal ko gussa bhi bahut aata tha
 He would often quarrel with the riders as well as fellow Tangwalas, but being over-ambitious, his heart soon filled with running a tanga and for a time worked at a tea stall
 hira bhai ne bataaya kii yahaan se jane ke baad unka kabhi bhi asaram se sampark nahin hua lekin uski mahatvakanksha ko dekhte hue lagata tha kii wo ek din jaruri bada aadmi banegaa

 He was quite ambitious and wanted to get rich

 gujarat or himachal main bhaajapa ne jeet kaa paracham laharaa to diya he, lekin ab party ke saamne in donon rajyon main mukhyamantri kaa chayan badi chunauti he
 In fact, in Himachal, BJP candidate Prem Kumar Dhumal is also losing his seat
 unke haarane kii surat main party ko siem kaa nayaa cheharaa talashna hoga
 At the same time, there is hardly any chance of Vijay Rupani in Gujarat sitting in the CM chair again
 khud roopaani bhi kah chuke hai ki siem koun hoga, iskaa faisla sansadeey board or vidhayak dal kii baithak main tay hoga
 After the Parliamentary Board meeting today, Health Minister JP Nadda said that after the victory, the party discussed the CM face in Gujarat and Himachal in the Parliamentary Board meeting
 isamen tay kiya gaya ki kendriya raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman or narendra tomars himachal jaakar vidhayakon se milenge
 It will be decided who will be the chief minister
 vahiin gujarat main bhi vijay roopaani ke phir semukhyamantribanane ke asaar kam hi dikh rahe hai
 Nadda said that Finance Ministers Arun Jaitley and Saroj Pandey would go to Gujarat to elect the Chief Minister in Gujarat
 donon netaa vidhayakon se milakar tay karenge ki is baar mukhyamantri koun hoga
 It can be clearly understood from this decision of the party that the party is not in the mood to re-appoint Vijay Rupani to the chief minister's chair
 isi ke chalate dilli se do netaaon ko gujarat bheja gaya he
 Earlier, on the withdrawal of Anandiben, along with Vijay Rupani, the name of Nitin Patel was also being discussed for the post of CM
 aise main is baar nitin patel ko agar siem kii kursi milti he to isamen achraj nahin hona chahie
 Significantly, in the result that came today, BJP has got a clear majority in Gujarat

 The IT Act is a sacred law but society interprets it in its own way
 technology bhi is maamle main lucatipi kaa khel khelti he
 When Ambedkarite journalist Satyendra Murali of Jaipur shared a cartoon on Gandhi's celibacy experiments on his Facebook page, he was promoting his ideology under freedom of expression
 bharat kaa samvidhan unhen aisa karne kii ijaajat detaa he
 There is no restriction on freedom of thought and expression on the basis of injury to one's faith in the Fundamental Rights chapter
 lekin jaipur police ne cartoon ke bare main shikaayat milane par murali ke khilaaf mukadmaa kaayam kar liya
 But thousands of people have already shared that cartoon so far, the likes may be in millions
 ab jaipur kii police dand samhita ko in lakhon logon par kaise lagu karegi yah dekhnaa rochak hoga
 The Indian Parliament cannot be said with confidence that it has passed the IT Act after considering such complexities in the new era of technology
 shaheen ne jo states massej thakare kii mrityu par likhaa tha, vah ab internet kii duniya ke lakhon logon tak pahunch chukaa he

 If your message can only be seen by your friend then this public should be considered a discussion in the drawing room or club and if law and order problem does not arise then do not think about taking action on such public to the police and the government needed
 kyonki internet or soshal netwarking kaa vistaar or myanmar se lekar misr or iran tak ke anubhav bataate hai ki shashan do-chaar-das logon kii dhar-pakad karke bhi aisi kisi baat ko failane se nahin roak saktaa, jisamen failane kaa dam he
 Technology has also created possibilities for unlimited expansion of good and bad ideas
 dand samhita ko is hakeekat se rou-ba-rou hona hoga
 The extent of the Maharashtra Police is Palghar and it is possible to reach even the borders of the country, but in the Internet age, an idea can come from any corner of the world and its server can be in any other part of the world

 Presenting the proposal, senior party leader Arun Jaitley said that recently Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had said in his message to the nation that 'money does not grow on trees' but in the coming elections, the public will tell them that voter's The vote also does not grow on the tree

 After the anti-romeo drive failed in UP, police is now being trained to identify Romeo
 is training main unhen bataaya ja rahaa he ki ve moral pulising na karen or mohabbat karne waalon ko tang na karen
 They are being shown their mistakes by showing videos of previous anti-romeo drives
 kuch vakt pehle police bhai-bahan ko bhi romeo bataakar pakad le gai thi, jisaki bahut aalochana hui thi
 Recently, a woman police officer from Jhansi reached the fort of Rani Laxmibai during the anti-romeo drive and abducted the girls sitting there and drove her home
 unhone apni dost se baat kar rahe ek ladke ko kaan pakadakar utthak-baithak karai
 As the female officers were taking local news reporters along with them, the innocent boy was insulted across the country
 police kii training main ab aise video dikhaakar unhen unki galati bataai ja rahi he
 Babita Singh, deputy SP of Women's Powerline, who is training, says, "the police were severely criticized in the last drive as they did things they should not have done
 is training ke jariye unhen sencetise kiya ja rahaa he ki jab koi ladkaa, ladki ko ched rahaa ho tabhi use pakadaa jaae
 Friends, do not disturb those who love you
 ” The training is being done at the office of Women's Powerline in Lucknow, in charge of IG Navneet Sikera
 training main unhen bataaya ja rahaa he ki desh ke kanoon main na to ladke-ladki kaa saath baithna jurm he or na mohabbat karnaa
 Therefore, police should not become enemies of love
 sikera baatcheet karne vaale andaaz main muhaavaron or kisse kahaniyon kii shakl main unhen gender training dete hai
 The comments sikera apane lacture main kehete hai ki ”ise aap apane upar rakhkar sochie ki aapaki beti baahar sarvice karti he
 She likes the boy she works with
 ladkaa bhi use pasand karata he
 The two are trying to understand each other
 unhen lagata he ki ve shaadi bhi kar sakate hai
 They are talking among themselves sitting in a park
 ab agar anti romeo squad vahaan chapa markar unki photo khinchne lage, unhen kaan pakadakar utthak-baithak karaane lage to aapke dil par kya gujaregi
 In the law of the country, friendship or love is not a crime
 isliye aise logon ko pareshaan kar kanoon na toden
 " training ke liye paanch-paanch jilon ke police ke log bulaae ja rahe hai
 People from all over UP have to be trained, as there is more need to change their mindset than the use of modernization and latest technology in police
 pichley dinon jhaansi kii ek mahila police afasar anti romeo drive ke dauraan rani lakshmibai ke kile main pahunchin or vahaan baithi ladakiyon ko beizzat kar ghar bhaga diya
 He made a boy talk to his friend by holding his ear and got him to make a sit-in meeting
 chunki mahila adhikari apane saath news channelon ke sthaneey samvaadadaataaon ko saath lekar chal rahi thim lihaaja us bekasoor ladke kii desh bhar main beijjati bhi hui
 By showing such videos in police training, they are being told their mistake
 training karne vaaleen woomen powerline kii dipti espi babitha singh kahati hai ki ”pichhali drive main police kii bade paimaane par aalochana hui kyonki usne vah kaam kiye jo use nahin karne chahie the
 Through this training, they are being sensitized that when a boy or a girl is teasing, then they are caught
 doston, mohabbat karne waalon ko pareshaan na karen
 " lakhanu main woomen powerline ke daftar main yah training ho rahi he, jiske incharge aiji navaneet sikera hai
 In the training, they are being told that in the law of the country, it is not a crime to sit with a boy or a girl and not to love
 isliye police mohabbat kii dushman na bane
 Sikkera gives them gender training in the form of idioms and anecdotal stories
 tippaniyan Cicerra says in his lecture that "put this on yourself and think that your daughter serves outside
 saath kaam karne vaale ladke ko vah pasand karti he
 The boy also likes her
 donon ek-duusare ko samajhane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 They think they can get married too
 ve kisi park main baithe aapas main baat kar rahe hai
 Now if the anti-romeo squad raids there and starts taking pictures of them, holding them ears and holding a mock-meeting, then what will be on your heart
 desh ke kanoon main dosti yaa mohabbat karnaa aparaadh nahin he
 Therefore, do not break the law by harassing such people
 ” Police personnel of five districts are being called for training
 puure upi ke logon kii training karai jaani he, kyonki police main mordnizeshan or letest technology ke istemaal se zyaada zarurat unke mindset ko badalane kii he
 Babita Singh, deputy SP of Women's Powerline, who is training, says, "the police were severely criticized in the last drive as they did things they should not have done

 Describing Pakistan as the center of global terrorism, BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav said on Monday that India's neighborhood is no longer just a problem but a global challenge
 ram madhav ne kaha ki loktantric duniya ko saath main aana chahie tathaa pakistan ko aatankwaad ke khilaaf karrwai karne ke liye baadhya karnaa chahie jo ek vaishvik samasya ban gaya he
 When asked about the relationship between India and Pakistan and the scope of dialogue between the two countries, Madhav said that there have been ups and downs in the last seven decades
 unhone kaha ki bharat ko pakistan ke saath dostana sambandh rakhane main nishchit rup se khushi hogi lekin sabase pehle use seemapar aatankwaad ke pramukh mudde par dhyaan dena hoga
 Madhav, who was addressing the conference organized by the us-india Strategic Relations Forum, said, "today we are going through a phase where India is no longer viewed by Pakistan as a difficult relationship
" duniya ke kai desh pakistan ko aise chintaa ke mudde ke taur par dekhte hai jahaan khaastaur par pakistan main aatanki dhaanche ke bare main baat ho rahi he
 Madhav said that there was a time when countries used to advise India to negotiate with Pakistan but today no one is doing it because Pakistan has become the center of global terrorism
 jammu kashmir ke bhaajapa maamalon ke prabharee madhav ne kaha ki anuchhed 370 samaapt hone ke baad kashmir ke bare main pakistan ne jis tarah pratikriya di, vah vaishvik samudaay ke saamne alag-thalag pad gaya he
 He said, "the Government of Pakistan is not really serious about managing the internal affairs of the country which should be the highest priority or commitment
" durbhagyapurna he ki hamaare pados main aise halaat hai
 Regarding the restrictions imposed on Pakistan by FATF, Madhav said that he has narrowly avoided coming on the black list but no one knows what will happen in February next year

 argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav ke parivaar ke benami sampattiyon ke khulaase kaa silsilaa abhi jari he
 The latest case is related to Lalu Prasad Yadav and Tejapratap Yadav, elder son of Rabri Devi
 khulaase main is baat kaa zikr he ki jab tejpratap 3 varsh 8 maheene ke the tabhi unako 13 acre or 12 dismil jameen daan main mil gai
 And this land was donated by none other than bjp's current Shivhar MP Rama Devi on 23 March 1992
 us vakt rama devi ke pati swargeey braj bihari prasad lalu prasad yadav ke mantrimandal main scince and technolji mantri the
 The current BJP MP Rama Devi used to be a homemaker then
 yah baat unhone dead main likhi he, "tejpratap rama devi kaa pyaara he, jinhen rama devi bahut pyaar va mohabbat karti hai
 Tejapratap also takes care of Rama Devi's happiness
 tejpratap naaballig he phir bhi jahaan tak sambhav hota he rama devi kii seva sushrusha karte hai
 It was Rama Devi's wish to make a gift to Tej Pratap in her life due to good service
 "bijepi netaa susheel kumaar modi ne lalu prasad yadav ke parivaar ke is benami sampatti kaa khulaasa karte hue kaha ki aakhir 3 saal 8 maheene kii umr main tej pratap ne rama devi kii kya khidamat kii jisase khush hokar yah jameen daan main di gai
 However, Sushil Kumar Modi, when asked about this subject, said that when she donated the land, her husband was in RJD and this thing is 25 years old
 aise main vahi bataa sakati hai ki kin paristhiyon main unhen jameen kaa daan karnaa padaa
 Sushil Kumar Modi has been accusing Lalu Prasad Yadav and his family in the past that they used to take land in lieu of making a minister, MLA, MP or getting some work or contract
 lalu rabari ke 15 saal or lalu prasad yadav ke rail mantri kaa kaal 2004 se 2009 tak jameen likhavane kaa silsilaa chalaa
 Lalu Prasad Yadav himself will not even be accounted for by donating so much land
 ye jameen mujffarpur jile ke mauja-kishunpur, madhuban, thana-kudhani main ek plot main 9 acre 24 dismil tathaa duusare plot main 3 acre 88 dismil kul 13 acre 12 dismil jameen daan kii gai
 The road originating near this land is still called Lalu Road
 argedy ke netaa raghunatha jha kanti singh ke saath-saath aaj bijepi saansad rama devi kaa naam bhi jameen daan se jud gaya he
 Although Rama Devi belongs to the zamindar family
 wo jameen daan kar sakati hai lekin modi kaa kahana he ki lalu yadav ke khataal main kaam karne vaala lalan choudhary or railway main khalasi ke pad par behaal hdayanand choudhary ne kaise lakhon kii jameen lalu fimali ko daan main de di
 Lalu Prasad continued to take advantage of the helplessness of the leaders and became the owner of property worth more than 1 thousand crores by resorting to the policy of 'land for work' at the same cost of every job
 susheel kumaar modine kaha ki abhi benami sampattiyon kaa or khulaasa karenge
 He said that after making a complaint against Tej Pratap in the Election Commission, he would also go to the Election Commission against Wobihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav

 Recently, the Women's Commission issued a notice there asking the brothel owners to appear in the Women's Commission

 After this, there is an atmosphere of fear among sex workers

 aise main yadi kothe sil kar die gaye to ve apana paalan poshan kaise karengi

 badi bhartiya companiyon ke kaaryakari adhikariyon kaa ek dal bhi pradhanmantri ke saath he
 Uttar Pradesh's major opposition parties have strongly criticized the remarks made by the state's Energy Minister Ramvir Upadhyay against the state's Kelokaayukta, calling it a culmination of daring and shamelessness
 mukhya vipakshi dal samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke pravaktaa rajendra choudhary ne shanivaar ko yahaan kaha ki bhrashtachar main aakanth dubi mayawati sarkaar ke mantri ab lokayukta jaise garimamay adhikari ko bhi apamaanit kar rahe hai
 This is the culmination of audacity and shamelessness and the result of their fury
 unhone kaha ki mayawati sarkaar ke zyaadaatar mantri bhrashtachar main duube hai or upaadhyaay bhi usee jamaat main shaamil hai
 Since the Lokayukta is investigating against him, the minister targeted him, but the public will teach such people a lesson in elections
 gauratlab he ki upaadhyaay ne shuukravaar raat hathras main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki lokayukta ne unke khilaaf jaanch kii lekin usamen kuch nahin mila
 If he did not have personal relations with the Lokayukta, he would have removed him by applying to the Supreme Court
 lokayukta kii sifarish par pradesh sarkaar ke ab tak paanch mantri barkhaast kiye ja chuke hai
 Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Governor B

 Jai Ho! kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki sarkaar videshi bainkon main jamaa bharatiyon ke kaale dhan ko waapas laane ke liye teji se kaam kar rahi he
 During the ongoing discussion on the Finance Bill in the Lok Sabha, Jaitley said, "I believe that you will not have to wait long to see the return of black money to the country
" loksabhaa main shuukravaar ko vitt vidheyak dhwani mat se paarit ho gaya
 He said, our government has set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT)
 yadi esaiti koi kadam uthaanaa chaahegi, to ham use puraa sahyog denge
 Whatever information we are getting, we are also giving it to the Supreme Court

 unhone kaha, kshetradhikaar ke sawaal par ulajhane kii jarurat nahin he ki yah adaalat kaa vishay he yaa hamaara vishay
 Accepting the request of Pakistan Cricket Board fast bowler Mohammad Aamir for an early return to the game, ICC CEO Dave Richardson said that he has looked into the matter but it may take some time to resolve it
 richardsan ne kaha, ‘pakistan cricket board kaa hamen aamir ke maamle main patr mil chukaa he lekin is maamle main ek prakriya hoti he jisase guzarana jaruri hota he
 In response to a question on Monday, he said, "it is necessary to have an interview with the player so that his mental state can be gauged as to how much he has developed
" vahiin se chije shuru hongi isaliye yah aasaan prakriya nahi he
 a Pakistan Cricket Board official recently said that he had written a letter to the ICC demanding early return to domestic cricket before Aamir's World Cup 2015

 However, he died late during treatment
 doctoron ne bataaya tha ki ilaaj ke dauraan bhi unhen heart atake aayaa tha
 Now the rebellion of young and trapped leaders against old and selfish leaders in the Congress is becoming an everyday thing
 party upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke prati khuleam apni nishtha jaahir karne vaale 14 sachivon ke ek gut ko gupt baithak karne or senior kism ke khurraat netaaon ke khilaaf abhiyaan chhedgaye ke liye alaakaman se paroksh sahmati mili to uske hausale bad gaye
 Now it has decided to emphasize on the party leaders to brainstorm on the topic of playing a strong opposition
 iske alaava ve is vishay par bhi charchaa karnaa chaahate hai ki vibhinn rajyon main apni satta kaise banaae rakhi jaae or duusare rajyon main kaise satta hasil kii jaae
 On 9 September, the secretaries of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) received a message to join the discussion at the Congress headquarters at 24, Akbar Road at 6 pm on 13 September
 isse pehle ranneeti tay karne vaali baithkon main unhen kabhi nahin bulaayaa gaya tha
 The group of 14 secretaries or team Rahul (this group prefers to be known by the same name) wants to open a front against the failures of Narendra Modi's 100-day work
 ‘rahul ko nishaanaa mat banaao’ muhim kaa netritv karne vaale ek sachiv kaa kahana he, “ham mukhya rup se yah chaahate the ki ve (varisht netaa) rahul par hamalaa karnaa band karen
 The party is at a disadvantage when senior leaders publicly express their critical opinion, even if they do not attack the leadership
 ” ve kehete hai, “ham logon ke bich jaakar kaam karte hai
 We do not sit in Delhi
 ” jaahir he, unka ishaara kuch puraane netaaon kii ore he jo unke anusaar kisi javabdehi ke bina satta kaa sukh bhogate rahe hai
 This secretary says, "BJP has completed 100 days
 ab hamen unki vifaltaaon ko ujagar karne kii jarurat he
 At this time, our local leaders have no guidelines on what to talk to potential voters when they meet them
 hamen is vishay par manthan karne kii sakht jarurat he
 "it is clear that the war that has started between Rahul's foot soldiers and Sonia Gandhi's army heroes at one level is a warning to the high command that he should become active and fix the party from within
 iske ek paksh main mahasachiv digvijay singh or janardan dvivedi aadi shaamil hai or duusare main rahul ke chune hue log hai
 The real reason for both anger is the party vice president's hesitation in handling leadership
 ek anya str par dekhen to ek gut duusare gut ke mukaable zyada praasangik bane rahane ko betaab he or antat rahul kii asli team banakar ubharna chahta he
 Each group hopes to someday improve the condition of the party
 rahul ke kheme main yuva sachiv shaamil hai jo zyaadaatar unke netritv vikaas kaarykram se nikle hai or jinhen madhusudan mistre or si
 P
 joshi jaise kuch varisht netaaon kaa samarthan hasil he
 This camp is much closer to Rahul, although it has nothing special to show in terms of achievements, except to follow Rahul's style of organizational politics
 bihar se eisisi ke ek sadsy mohammad samim kehete hai, “rahul khud ko un logon tak simit kyon rakhen jo apane bal par ek chunaav bhi nahin jeet sakate
 He has his own experience and good young companions
 ”bijepi ne chunaavon main shandaar jeet hasil karne ke baavjood jamini str tak jaakar apane sanghathan ko chust-durust kiya he
 The party has been busy with its work under the leadership of Narendra Modi and his special ally Amit Shah, while the Congress workers are angry that their leaders are still confused about the new image of the party
 sansad main rahul kaa netritv mukhya rup se bhavukta se prerit rahaa he
 Apart from increasing his presence in Parliament — from 43 percent in the Lok Sabha to 82 percent so far — he still has not been seen speaking much
 vipaksh main hone ke baavjood unhone loksabhaa main ek bhi sawaal nahin uthaaya he or bahes main bhi sirf ek baar hi hissaa liya he (dekhen graphic)
 The Congress remains not only attractive to voters, but also to its leaders
 loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle hi party ke varisht netaaon kii bhagdad un rajyon main to ab bhi jari he, jahaan chunaav hone vaale hai
 In Haryana, for instance, former mps Avatar Singh Bhadana and Birendra Singh left the Congress and joined the INLD and BJP respectively
 chhattisgarh main antagarh upachunaav main congress ummidavaar manturam pavaar ne namakan kii jaanch ke baad apana naam waapas le liya or bijepi ke ummidavaar ko nirvirodh jeet hasil hui
 In Haryana and Maharashtra, where the Congress is now facing anti-incumbency sentiments after several tenures, the problems with the infighting of the party are going to increase further
 congress agar kisi ladaai kaa saamana karne ko taiyaar he to vah he uski andruni ladaai
 The party has still not made any beginning towards the changes which Rahul said on 8 December that such steps will be taken which cannot be imagined
 yahaan tak ki sonia ne “gahan aatmanirikshan” karne kaa jo bharosa dilaayaa tha, vah bhi shuru nahin ho sakaa he
 Congressmen say that they are still waiting for that change to begin

 agle do dinon tak purebharat kii raftaar tham jaaegi
 Labor organizations have claimed this
 sarkaar se baatcheet kaa koi nateeja nahin nikalne ke baad desh ke kareeb das karod karmchaaree agle 48 ghante ke liye hadtaal par ja rahe hai
 It is expected to come to a standstill from the bank to the business industry
 pehle se hi charmarai arthvyavastha ko do dinon kii is hadtaal se 20 hazaar karod rupee ke nuksaan kii ashanka he
 After the trade unions failed to negotiate with the government, it has now been decided that the workers associated with the 11 trade unions of the country will not come to work for the next two days
 majdoor sanghathanon ne das maange sarkaar ke saamne rakhi thim
 Demands to stop inflation, increase employment opportunities, disinvestment in government institutions and enforcement of labor laws are important
 baatcheet benatija hone ke baad bhi sarkaar kii ore se kendriya shram mantri mallikarjun khadge majdoor unionon se guzarish kar rahi he ki wo hadtaal par na jaaen
 Labor unions have no objection to the government's trust
 sarkaar ke saath hui baithak main vitt mantri kii gairmaujuudagi unhen buree tarah khal gayi he
 BN Rai Sarkar, General Secretary of the Indian Workers Union is not serious about our demands
 
 
 kal kii meeting main vitt mantri hi nahin aaye
 10 lakh bank employees are also participating in this strike
 yani agle do dinon tak kisi bhi sarkari bank main kaamkaaj nahin ho sakegaa
 The strike will directly affect the functioning of banking, insurance, income tax, telecom, postal, oil and gas sectors
 majdoor unioron kii hadtaal main rhite or left sarkaar ke khilaaf ek saath khadey najar aa rahe hai
 This movement has the support of many opposition parties including BJP, Shiv Sena and Left parties
 shivasena ne to somvaar ko hi mumbai main mazdooron ke samarthan main ek raily bhi nikaali thi
 An estimated loss of 15 to 20 thousand crores is being claimed to halt almost all the major services of the country, which are related to the common people
 bas se lekar bank tak, post offis se lekar kaarkaanon tak kahin bhi majdoor 48 ghanton ke liye kaam par nahin jayega
 On the other hand, the state governments have also agreed that the impact of this shutdown should be minimal
 taiyaari he puure desh ko thap karne kii
 It is announced that neither Mangwar will work in government offices nor money transactions in banks
 daawa ye ki sadak par daud rahi gaadiyaan bhi kal dhunde najar nahin aaengi, na auto rickshaw milenge or naa hi bas
 Even the official telephone bell may not be burnt tomorrow and it is better not to wait for the letters, because telephone and post office workers are also joining this strike
 elaan kiya ja rahaa he ki kal tel companiyon par bhi taala jadaa hoga
 That is, there is direct preparation to stop the pace of the country
 neshnal organizeshan of bank works ke ol india general secretary ashvini rana ne kaha ki bank bhi apni maang ko lekar is hadtaal main shaamil ho rahe hai
 The strike has also caused a stir in the business world
 do dinon main arabon rupye ke nuksaan kii ashanka ne unki neend uda di he
 Assocham Secretary General DS Rawat said that the loss from this strike is estimated to be 15 to 20 thousand rupees
 centre sarkaar kii trade unionon se baatcheet fail ho chuki he
 Now all the state governments are trying to neutralize the strike
 dilli main ditisi karmchaariyon kii chhuttiyaan radd kar di gayin hai taaki sari basen sadak par daud saken
 Best buses will be on the entire road in Mumbai, Mumbai's lifeline railway will not be affected due to the non-participation of railway employees in this strike
 mumbai ke ek bade union ke hadtaal main shaamil na hone se bhi mumbai waalon ko badi raahat rahegi
 In Kolkata too, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has ordered all factories and government offices and public vehicles to function smoothly

 Athletes will be more troubled
 In Japan, heat is constantly increasing
 1980 ke dashak main vahaan kaa taapmaana 28-29 degree celsius rahaa karata tha jo ab badhkar 30 degree celsius ko paar kar gaya he or ho saktaa he ki agle saal isamen or badhotaree ho jaae
 Running on the track is extremely difficult for athletes in hot and elevated temperatures, especially in long-distance races such as marathons or treetals
 iske alaava rail walking or sailing jaise khel bhi garmi main athleton ko pareshaan kar sakate hai
 In view of the possible heat during the marathon event in July, not April, health officials have also proposed to the organizers that field matches like marathon be held in April instead of held in july-august and that too at 6 am near
 saath hi purushon kii 50 kilometre res subah saadhe 5 baje shuru karaae jane kii baat ho rahi he
 Health officials fear that running athletes in summer may affect their health
 agar unhen july-agast main daudna padaa to pradarshan par asar padegaa
 The next Olympics is against Marathon on 2 August (female) and 9 August (male)
 garmi main khilaadiyon ko manamafik rigelt hasil karne main dikkat hogi
 9 Year Study on Marathon In 2012, a French researcher conducted a study between 2001 and 2010 on the results (races and results of each year) of 1,791,972 marathon runners
 iske liye unhone 3 european (paris, landan or berlin) or 3 american (boston, chicago or neuyork) shaharon main hue marathon res kaa chunaav kiya
 4 large factors (temperature, humidity, dew point and atmospheric pressure at sea level) associated with different environments of 60 races were also included
 isamen pradooshan ke str ko bhi rakhaa gaya
 French researchers found in their study that male and female athletes have different ideal temperatures for marathon races
 mahilaon ke liye 49
 82 Fahrenite (9
 9 celsius) or purushon ke liye 42
 a temperature of 8 Fahrenite (6 Celsius) is best for completing long races
 adhyayan main yah bhi saamne aayaa ki taapmaana badhane ke kaaran jahaan speed par asar padataa he to logon ke res chhodane kii dar bhi bad jaati he
 Reduction in speed in increasing heat: This study also revealed that 29
 44 degree celsius ke taapmaana main mahila athleton kii speed main 13
 Speed decreased by 47 percent and male athletes by 6 percent
 vaayu taapmaana bhi marathon res main behad myne rakhti he or usase dhavakon kii speed or stemina par asar padataa he
 However, the Tokyo administration is also continuously working in this direction
 tokyo metropolishan government garmi ke asar ko kam karne kii koshishon main juty he
 She is constructing 136 km of special coating roads in the city center to reduce the temperature
 abhi aayojan main 1 saal kaa samay shesh he, lekin vahaan par vaataavaran ko thanda banaae rakhane ke liye 150 swayamsevakon ko bataur trial par rakhaa gaya he
 Fans and towels are also provided to keep the players cool
 asi tent or pankhe kaa aayojanaiske alaava is saal garmi main stadium yaa aayojan sthal ke paas asi tent, pankhe or fawwaare lagaae ja rahe hai jisase khel ke dauraan darshakon ke aane or bheed kii vajah se bade taapmaana ke antar ko parkhaa ja sake
 In addition to temporary AC tents, fans, cold showers for next year's games, ice cube is being arranged for free in open matches
 1964 ke baad tokyo pehali baar olympic games kii mejabani karne ja rahaa he
 At present, due to rain, there is little relief from heat in India, but many countries of the world are facing severe heat at this time, including Japan
 olympic games shuru hone se ek saal pehle se hi vahaan garmi ko lekar taiyaari shuru kii ja chuki he
 The organizers are trying to make this event very spectacular and grand
 saath hi videshi mehmaanon or khilaadiyon ko kisi tarah kii dikkat kaa saamana na karnaa padaa
 The organizers are still trying to avoid every situation of possible heat
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki agle saal tokyo kaa taapmaana kya rahata he or aayojak apane makasad main kitne kaamyaab hote hai
 At the moment it is certain that the players as well as the sports lovers will have to be ready to face the heat

 RJD supremo Lalu Prasad called Gandhian social activist Anna Hazare's Janatantra rally in Patna's Gandhi Maidan as a 'flop show' to change the system in the country

 When asked about the crowd gathered at the Janantra rally, Lalu said, "so much of the crowd reaches Gandhi Maidan on a stroll
" ’bhrashtachar virdohi abhiyaan chalaane vaale gandhivadi samajasevi par hamalaa bolte hue lalu ne kaha, ‘ye log civil socity ke naam par sansad, netaaon or yahaan tak ki nyaaypalika ke bare main bhi pratikul tippanee kar rahe hai

 ’samprag-ek sarkaar main rail mantri rah chuke lalu prasad ne kaha, ‘ye log vichaar evam abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke naam par centre sarkaar or netaaon ke bare main gaiyr jimmedaarana bayaan de rahe hai

 According to them, the photo was put right, yet on some basis the form has been rejected
 ek ne twit kiya he ki uske bhai kaa farm is aadhaar par riject ho gaya kyonki usee naam or janmatithi kaa koi doosraa bhi tha
 One has to say that the photo which has been rejected has been approved in another examination of the railway itself
 maine inase kaha ki in dinon kashmir kii khabar hi pramukh rahegi
 These people are also busy in Kashmir, but it would have been good if they had some form of form and they were also allowed to appear in the examination

 hegg sthit antarrashtriya nyaayalay ne kulbhushan jadhav ke maamle main pakistan ko karaara jhatka diya he
 The ICJ stayed the execution of Jadhav, rejecting Pakistan's claims
 padhein jadhav maamle main ICJ kaa puraa orderdichhs Order on Kulbhushan jadhavbysaad Bin Omeron scribdvahim ICJ ke is aadesh se baukhalaaye pakistan ke videsh mantralay ne kaha is faisle ko chunauti dene kii baat kahi
 The Ministry of External Affairs said that India did not give a responsible response to Pakistan in this matter and they will expose India to the world
 jabaki duusari ore pakistan dephence kii ore se ek twit main kaha gaya he ki duniya kii kisi bhi adaalat ke paas ye adhikaar nahin he ki vah ek samprabhu raashtra kii adaalat dwaara die gaye faisle ko palat de
 Pakistan will fight with full force
 No court in the world has the jurisdiction to overturn a verdict given by the courts of a sovereign state
 We fight! # pakistanisrejecticj— Pakistan Defense (@defencepk) May 18, 2017 Know what has happened in Kulbhushan's case so far? This question of Pakistan now raises the question whether Pakistan will execute it and if Pakistan does not execute the order If it does, then what path will be left for India? 18 years ago, the ICJ has lost the case to India, Pakistan-based International Justice Court (ICJ) has been established under United Nations rules and the United Nations Article 94 of the Charter of the Law clearly states that all member states of the United Nations must comply with the orders of the ICJ in all matters in which they are parties
 yahaan bharat or pakistan donon ne hi is par sahmati jataai thi
 At the same time there is an 'alternative protocol' of the Vienna Agreement involving efforts at diplomatic level to resolve mutual disputes and both neighboring countries are also part of this protocol
 aise kaam karata he ICJ, 15 jajon kii team degi jadhav cese main faislaiha yah baat gaur karne vaali he ki ICJ kaa aadesh antim hota he or uske khilaaf aap kahin apil nahin kar sakate hai, haalanki uske paas apane faislon ko lagu karwaane kii koi shakti nahin hoti
 In such a situation, if Pakistan refuses to follow the ICJ order, then India will have to take up the matter with the UN Security Council
 haalanki suraksha parishad is maamle main dakhal se inkaar bhi kar saktaa he or agar aisa hota he, to bharat ke liye aadesh par amal karaane kaa koi rasta nahin bachegaa
 Jadhav's lawyer has a house of 100 crores, Bell was given to Salman in 3 hours
 
 PHOTOS At the same time, if all the member countries of the Security Council are ready, they can pressure Pakistan to follow the order
 haalanki bharat ke liye yah kaam khaasaa mushkil sabit hoga, kyonki suraksha parishad main china bhi sthaayee sadsy he or khud ko pakistan kaa 'sadabahaar dost' bataanaa vaala china pakistan ke khilaaf prastaav par vito na karen, isaki sambhaavna behad kam he

 Now the new middle class of urban India does not consider their daughters to be guests of a foreign home where their last identity is as a wife and mother
 yahaan tak ki kamjor prishthbhumi vaale shahari abhibhavakon ne bhi apni betiyon ko alag tareeke se dekhnaa shuru kar diya he
 In spite of the firm belief in conservative values and the institution of family name, it is very rare that parents should discriminate against their daughters in terms of sending them to school or college
 nai bazaar arthvyavastha ne saamaajik rishton or aakankshaon ko bhi nayaa aakaar diya he
 Due to the fast growing service sector, the demand for many types of labor force has increased
 upbhog kii badhati samskruti ne nai aakankshaayen paidaa kii hai jisase har aadmi kaam karne or sapane saakaar karne ke liye protsaahit hua he
 There is nothing more valuable than a well-spendable income in a consumer society
 har cheez hasil karne yogya lag rahi he
 But India is a country of contradictions
 jaise-jaise desh dhani ho rahaa he, iske virodhabhas or badhate ja rahe hai
 During the development of the market economy in Western Europe in the 19th century, women had entered the newly emerging labor market and a kind of new democratic consciousness had arrived
 us dauraan mahilaon ko nagarikon jaise adhikaar dene kii maang karne vaale andolanon kaa ubhaar hua tha
 In the 1960s and 70s, feminist movements raised more fundamental questions about the relationship with power in private life
 1980 ke dashak main pashchim jagat main mahilaon ko samanta dene ke bare main nai chetana dikhi
 This was a revolutionary change
 bharat main bhi nariwadi andolan dekhe gaye hai
 The so-called autonomous women's movement that emerged in the 1980s questioned the violence against women in the streets and homes
 unhone kaamkaaji mahilaon ke vetan main bhedbhaav or adhikaron se jude sawaal bhi uthaae
 Such movements were mostly led by middle class urban women, but they were expressing concerns of various sections of Indian women
 unka tark tha ki mahila shashaktikaran tab hi ho saktaa he jab bhartiya samaaj kii pitrusattatmak soch or iske aadhaar par bane saamaajik rishton ke dhaanche ko badla jaae
 However, the process of liberalization and globalization started empowering women through the market
 isse unki aakanksha, bhagidaari or aage badhane kii ichha bad gai
 The question of politics of social relations now seems meaningless
 rajnatik chetana ke abhaav or ling-bhed tathaa pitrusatta se aankh moond lene kii pravriti ne ek aise shahari or tathakthith modern socity ko janm diya he jisamen auraten pehle se zyada asurakshit ho gai hai

 mumbai metro ko shuru hue abhi ek maheenaa bhi nahin hua he or isaki kamiyaan saamne aane lagi hai
 On Wednesday, water started dripping from the roof of the metro due to rain in Mumbai
 pani tapakane kaa video saamne aane ke baad is bare main logon ko pataa chalaa
 This video is being rapidly shared on social media
