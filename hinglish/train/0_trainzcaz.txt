 The head of Pakistan's intelligence agency is spearheading a new campaign, which focuses on removing the country's coastal city of Karachi from the influence of a strong political party
 sena kii is karrwai ko desh main haalia varshon main kii gai sabase badi karrwai mana ja rahaa he
 a government official close to Rizwan Akhtar, the head of the intelligence agency ISI, said that gradually the military is taking over Karachi, which would traditionally be an extension of army power
 naam na bataane kii shart par is adhikari ne saath hi kaha, 'karachi bahut bada shahar he jahaan zyada jameen, zyada vyapaar or sansaadhan hai
 No single party will be allowed to run the city
 ' Karachi, which has been under the grip of violence for a long time, is the most prosperous city in Pakistan
 yahaan desh kaa aadha rajasav hi nahin, balki stock exange, central bank or bada port bhi he
 In Karachi, army operations began in 2013, when cases of murder increased greatly and corpses became common
 beete maheene shuru hue is abhiyaan kaa mukhya lakshya badmaashon or aatankiyon ko bataaya ja rahaa hai, lekin kuch logon kaa kahana he ki nishane par muttahida kaumi movement (emcuam) hi rahane vaali he
 At the same time, when asked about this, the army spokesperson did not get any kind of reply from him
 emcuam kii pakad kamjor karne or netaa altaaf hossain kaa nirvaasan, shahar main duusare partiyon ke liye bhi avasar lekar aayega
 It can also generate sympathy for the army, as it did with the Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf party led by Imran Khan
 tippaniyan This step will also bring benefits for the army in the economic hub
 sainya adaalat ke jariye rashtriya suraksha, videsh niti or judishari par pakad majboot karne main bhi sena ko aasaani hogi
 Amidst the growing influence of the army, it is certain that this will cause trouble for Nawaz Sharif, who promised to improve relations with India in the 2013 elections

 vahiin sena pravaktaa se jab is bare main poocha gaya to unase kisi tarah kaa jawaab nahin mila
 The weakening of the MQM and the deportation of leader Altaf Hussain will also bring opportunities for other parties in the city

 iskaa ek udhaaharan sattarudh congress party ke netaa rashid masood or raaj babbar hai
 According to Rashid Masood, a lot of food is available in Delhi for only 5 rupees
 gaur karne vaali baat he ki isse pehle congress pravaktaa raaj babbar ne yah daawa kiya tha ki aaj bhi mumbai main puraa bhojan 12 rupee main karnaa sambhav he
 Actually, the Congress leader's statements on the cost of food are being given to justify the latest figures of the Planning Commission on poverty in the country
 guuruuvaar ko jab rashid masood se garibi rekha ke maapdand par sawaal poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki dilli main log maatr paanch rupee main bharpayt khaanaa kha sakate hai
 At the same time, Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari also justified these figures
 unhone kaha, 'koi bhi aadmi har din rashan nahin kharidta

 hamaare driver or naukar kii tankhwaah chaar se paanch hajaar rupee he

 is
 babbar ne kaha, ‘logon ko din main do vakt puraa bhojan milanaa chahie
 How they can achieve this is a very good question that you have asked

 No no, not big paw
 dher sara chaaval, daal, sambar or kuch subjiyan bhi mili hai

 anil kumblekacoch pad se istipha dene ke baad bhartiya team ko ab ravi shastri ke rup main nayaa coach mil gaya he
 After the manner in which Kumble was treated as a coach, then clearly Kohli had to face a lot of criticism
 ravi shastri ke coach banane ke baad ab ummid kii ja rahi he ki team ek phir se ekajute hokar acha pradarshan karegi, lekin ham aap ko bataaenge ki ravi shastri ke coach banane ke baad team india par kya bura asar pad saktaa hai:senior khilaadiyon kaa cat saktaa he patta1
 Yuvraj Singh: After Ravi Shastri becomes the coach, the team's experienced players can fall
 yuvi par is samay umr kaa asar dikhne laga he
 In such a situation, it can be difficult for these players to make a place in the team
 bharat kii team main ek samay match vinar kii bhoomika nibhaane vaale or bharat ko 2007 kaa tii20 world cap or 2011 kaa world cap jitaane main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane vaale yuvaraj singh jab se cancer kii beemaari se thik hokar aae hai, uske baad se unki fitness bhi ab pehle jaisi nahin rahi he
 In batting too, there is no glimpse of that old Yuvraj, except the first match of the recently ended Champions Trophy, Yuvraj has not done anything special in the rest of the match
 bhartiya team ko 2019 kaa world cap jeetna he to is baat kii puri ummid he ki shastri is ko zarur dhyaan main rakhenge, jis kaaran yuvaraj singh kaa team se baahar hona lagbhag pakkaa mana ja rahaa he
 2
 mahendra singh dhoni:dhoni ke haalia pradarshan ko dekhte hue un par bhi kaaphi sawaal uth rahe hai, ki unhen 2019 ke world cap main le janaa kitna thik hoga or shastri yuva ballebaajon ko kaaphi tarjeeh dete he, jiske baad dhoni ko baahar kaa rasta bhi dikhaaya ja saktaa he
 Earlier, Ravi Shastri was also not in favor of Dhoni's captaincy
 jab ravi shastri ne ek tivi sho main kaha tha ki meri to bas dhoni ko salaah he ki ab vakt aa gaya he ki wo pressure jhelane ke bajaae apni cricket kaa lutf uthaaen or viraat kohli ko teenon formet kii captaini saunp de
 Because that hunger is no longer visible under Dhoni's captaincy
 khabaren ye bhi thi kii shastri ke kaaran hi dhoni ne test cricket se sanyas liya tha
 Dhoni was very uncomfortable due to the close relationship between Ravi Shastri and Virat Kohli
 pareshaani is kadar bad gai thi ki dhoni khulkar faisle nahin le paa rahe the
 The team's aggressive attitude: Cricket has always been considered a gentleman's game
 bharat ko hameshaa ek shant team ke rup main dekha jaataa hai
 The reason for this has been the attitude of the players in the field
 lekin behad aakraamak swabhaav ke ravi shastri or kohli ke ek saath aane se team ke ravaiye main badlaav aayega
 This attitude in the team will bring a negative thinking, which can affect the performance of the team and the performance of the players
 ab dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki ravi shastri aane vaale samay main kaise team ko aage le ja sakate hai
 Only Virat's support: Indian team captain Virat Kohli and Ravi Shastri's relationship is also known
 viraat kohli ko ravi shastri kaa sabase kareebi mana jaataa hai
 It is also said that it was due to Ravi Shastri that Virat Kohli also got the captaincy of the Test team
 ravi shastri jab team india ke nideshak ke rup main kaary kar rah the, tab bhi ravi hameshaa hi viraat kohli kii tarif or unka samarthan karte hue najar aate the
 Supporting only Virat Kohli can create problems for Ravi Shastri
 kyonki agar aane vaale samay ke bare main sochaa jaae, to team india kaa koi anya khilaadi yah nahin chahenga ki team kaa mukhya coach keval team ke captain kaa hi samarthan kare or kisikanhin
 In such a situation, the expectations of rebellion in the team will increase greatly
 cheteshwar pujaraotisvin kii bhi ho sakati he chuttibhartiya team ke liye test main rahul dravid kesanyasalene ke baad yadi kisi khilaadi ne unki jagah ko lene kaa kaam kiya he, to wo cheteshwar pujaara he
 But Ravi Shastri does not like Pujara's acrimony, as Pujara plays very slowly and this increases the chances of a Test match draw
 isi baat ko lekar ek baar ravi shastri ne isi baat ko lekar pujaara kii aalochana bhi kii thi
 Let us tell you that due to the slow batting of Pujara, Rohit Sharma was fed at number 3 in some matches
 vahiin team india ke of spinner ravichandran aswin bharat main to behad safal hote hai, lekin jaise hi team upmahadweep ke baahar khilne ke liye jaati he, to aswin kii gende bilkul bhi asardaar sabit nahin hoti he
 In such a situation, Ravi Shastri can once again do what he did in the first match of the 2014 Australian tour in Adelaide
 jab unki adhyakshata vaali team management ne aswin ko drops karke karn sharma ko khilaayaa tha
 Ravi Shastri's becoming the coach is considered to be the end of the Dhoni era as well as the rise of the Virat Yuga
 jis tarah kohli kii khwahishon ke liye bisisiai or salaahkaar samiti ne maapdando or niyamon ko taak par rakhaa he vah darshata he ki is samay kohli captain nahin balki bhartiya cricket team ke big bos ho gaye hai

 iske tahat jila mukhyalay ko 24 ghante, tahseelon main 20 ghante or gaanvon ko 18 ghante bijli dene kii baat kahi gai thi
 Today, after 6 months, this promise of Yogi has proved to be just promise

 Yogi's own area Gorakhpur also continues to cut power for hours
 yogi sarkaar ne bijli ko lekar viviipi jile kii pahchaan to khatm kar di lekin zyaadaatar jilon main kai vajah se bijli sankat gaharaaya huya he

 As a result, Anshuman started searching for the horse with sixty thousand people of Sagar

 Earth was then dug to find Ashwa in Hades
 khudaai par unhone dekha ki saakshaat bhagwaan 'maharishi kapil' ke rup main tapasya kar rahe hai
 Near them, the horse grass of Maharaja Sagar is grazing
 praja unhen dekhakar 'chor-chor' chillane lagi or is tarah maharishi kapil kii samadhi tut gai
 The Maharishi opened his fiery eyes and consumed all the subjects
 in mrit logon ke uddhaar ke liye hi maharaj dilip ke putr bhageerath ne kathor tap kiya tha
 Pleased with Bhagiratha's tenacity, Brahma asked him to ask for the bridegroom, Tobgirth demanded 'ganga'
 is par brahma ne kaha- 'rajan! tum ganga kaa prithvi par avataran to chaahate ho? parantu kya tumne prithvi se poocha he ki vah ganga ke bhaar tathaa veg ko sambhaal paaegi? meraa vichaar he ki ganga ke veg ko sanbhaalane kii shakti keval bhagwaan shankar main he
 Therefore, it would be appropriate that the grace of Lord Shiva be obtained to handle the weight and velocity of the Ganges
 'maharaj bhageerath ne vaise hi kiya
 Pleased with his harsh penance, Brahma left the Ganges stream from his kamandal
 tab bhagwaan shiv ne ganga kii dhara ko apni jataaon main sametakar jataaen baandh leen
 As a result, Ganga could not find a way out of the jata
 maharaj bhageerath ne bhagwaan shiv kii aradhana main ghor tap shuru kiya
 Then somewhere, Lord Shiva gave a boon to free the Ganges
 is prakaar shivaji kii jataaon se chhot kar gangaji himalay kii ghaatiyon main kal-kal ninaad karke maidan kii ore mudi
 In this way Bhagiratha got very lucky after the Ganges on earth
 unhone janamanas ko apane punya se upakrit kar diya
 The stream of Ganges that flows from ages to ages tells the saga of the painful sadhana of Maharaja Bhagiratha
 ganga pranimaatr ko jeevandaan hi nahin detii, mukti bhi detii he
 For this reason, the glory of Ganga is sung in India and even abroad

 Fanne is very fond of singing in the orchestra

 His wife (divya Dutta) and daughter Lata (pihu Sand) live in his house

 But this does not happen

 This chair is nothing to me

 Mamata Banerjee also questioned the accuracy of the elections during the conference
 unhone kaha, 'main siem ke rup main keval tabhi aage bad sakati hum agar log ek saahasik kadam uthaane ke liye taiyaar hon
 We need to increase our vote share

 padhein, subah kii 5 badi khabaren
 
 
 The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has ordered the car manufacturing company Volkswagen to pay a fine of Rs 100 crore to the Central Pollution Control Board by 5 pm on Friday evening
 engiti ne sakht lahaze main kaha ki agar yah rakam shuukravaar tak foxwagon company ne nahin jamaa karai, to company ke emdi ko giraftaar kiya jayega
 Volkswagen company is being charged this fine because the car maker had installed a tampering device to show reduced carbon emissions in diesel vehicles
 is gadabadi ke kaaran sadakon par chalati foxwagon kii gadiyon ne paryaavaran main pradooshan failaayaa or un niyamon kaa paalan nahin kiya, jo pradooshan ko rokane ke liye car nirmaataa company ko karnaa anivaary hota he
 After the matter came to light, the NGT formed a committee to investigate, which assessed the damage to the environment
 cameti kii report aane ke baad engiti ne foxwagon company par 171 karod kaa jurmaana lagaaya tha
 However, instead of paying the fine, the Volkswagen company challenged the ngt's order in the Supreme Court, but the top court in the case refused to grant relief to the company
 sarvocch adaalat ne jurmaane kii rakam ko bharne ko lekar company ko koi ste nahin diya or maamle kii sunwaayee ke liye 21 janvari kii taarikh tay kar di
 After this, on Thursday, the NGT, during the hearing of the case, directed the company to either deposit Rs 100 crore by 5 pm on Friday or be prepared to suffer serious consequences
 agar company ne engiti ke adeshon kaa paalan karte hue guuruuvaar tak 100 karod rupee kii rakam nahin chukaai, to company ke emdi kii giraftaar se lekar bharat main foxwagon company kii sampattiyon ko jabt karne tak kii karrwai kii ja sakati he
 Volkswagen company had first admitted in 2015 that it had installed 'defit Device' in 11 million vehicles sold worldwide between 2008 and 2015
 is divaais kii khaasiyat ye he ki yah lab pareekshan ke dauraan foxwagon taron ko paryaavaran ke maanakon par khara sabit kar detii thi, jabaki sachai ye thi ki foxwagon car nitric oxide gas kaa utsarjan zyada kar rahi thim
 This emission was four times higher than European standards
 foxwagon ko is her-pher ke kaaran ab tak alag-alag jagahon par arabon rupee kaa jurmaana dena padaa he
 The company has paid a fine of around Rs 8,300 crore in Germany alone
 saath hi company ke kuch sheersh adhikariyon ko is maamle main jail bhi ho chuki he
 Now in India too, the difficulty of Volkswagen company has increased
 supreme court ne buudhvaar ko aadhaar kii anivaaryta par aitihaasik nirnay sunaaya
 The Supreme Court has declared Aadhaar constitutional with certain conditions
 aadhaar maamle parfaislitna aasaan nahin rahaa, ise 9 nyaayadhishon dwaara nirdhaarit kiye gaye mandando par parkhaa gaya
 How difficult a basis decision? a bench of nine judges set three criteria that are required to be met to decide on the accepted limits of privacy violations for the validity of a law
 court ne kaha he ki niztaa kaa ek sweekrut seemaa tak hanan kiya ja saktaa he agar kalyankari kadam kanoon se samarthit hon or ‘rajya kavaidhhit ho
 'at the same time it must meet the' test of proportionality '
 pradhan nyaayadhish deepak mishra kii adhyakshata vaali paanch nyaayadhishon kii samvidhan peeth ne aadhaar kanoon kii vaidhata ko barkaraar rakhte hue kaha ki yah niztaa maamle main sunaae gaye faisle kii teen kasautiyon par khara utarataa he

 a five-member constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra, in its judgment on the basis of majority, declared Aadhaar mandatory for filing income tax returns and making PAN cards
 haalanki, abaadhar cardko bank khate se link karnajarurinhin he or mobile phone kaa conection dene ke liye telecom companiyaan logon se aadhaar nahin maang saktin
 Angered by the manner in which the communal violence in Kishtwar was introduced, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said on Thursday that the people of the state are treated differently, which causes them to feel isolated
 umr ne swatantraaa diwas ke apane sambodhan main kaha, ‘mujhase akasar poocha jaataa he ki jammu-kashmir ke log baaki desh kii janata se alag kyon mahasoos karte hai
 We do not feel isolated, but we are made to do so by adopting a different attitude towards us
 aaj main is bare main spashtikaran duungaa
 He said that whenever he was asked this question, he could not come to a conclusion but the way the communal clashes in Kishtwar were presented to the rest of the country, he got the answer
 kishtwar main hui hinsa main teen log maare gaye
 Due to this incident, the opposition launched a scathing attack on the state government and the state minister of state for home Sajjad Kichlu had to resign
 umr ne pichley saal or is saal march tak desh main sampradayik dangon main maut ke maamalon par kendriya grih mantralay ke aankadon kaa hawala diya jinamein uttar pradesh main 34 log maare gaye or maharashtra main 2012 main 13 log dangon kaa shikaar hue log shaamil hai
 He apparently referred to BJP leaders Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj, saying, 'did these incidents get discussed in Parliament? Leave the talk of the leaders going to these places, but did they mention it on Twitter too
 ’umr ne kaha, ‘kishtwar main jo hua uski ninda honi chahie
 This is also because it happened during my tenure as Chief Minister
 hamane nyaayik ayog kii ghoshnaa kii he or uske nishkarshon ko saarvajanik kiya jayega
 In a way, referring to the Bijri and like-minded parties, Omar questioned the noise about the Kishtwar riots
 unhone kaha, ‘kya pehali baar desh main aisa hua he? kya keval kishtwar aisi jagah he jahaan yah hua?’ mukhyamantri ke mutabik vah kishtwar ke dangon kii tulana anya choti ghatnaon se nahin karenge or anya rajyon main hui galtiyon kii ore ishaara karke ise uchit nahin tehraayenge
 Taking a dig at the media indirectly, Omar asked why communal riots in other places of the country were not discussed in the news channels' programs and newspapers
 unhone kaha, ‘in ghatnaon par kitne tivi kaarykram prastut kiye gaye or kitne stambh likhe gayi?’ The BJP won 4 out of the 6 assembly seats under Haryana's Faridabad district

 Petersburg from Paris congress mukhyalay ke aajkal ke sannaate ko shaam 6 baje ke aasapaas mohan prakaash murdaabaad or arun yadav murdaabaad ke naaron ne tod diya
 The journalists, who are looking for the news of the Congress, immediately catch him on his camera and mobile
 mohan prakaash madhyapradesh ke incharge hai or arun yadav pradesh congress adhyaksh
 Some activists, who reached the AICC from Madhya Pradesh, were accusing the two local organizations of arbitrarily changing seven block presidents before the elections
 unka kahana tha ki madhyapradesh main sanghathan chunaav kaa elaan ho chukaa he lekin usase pehle hi whatsap massej ke jariye saat block adhyakshon ko badal diya gaya he
 This worker reached the Congress headquarters with his complaint in this regard
 unka aarope he ki ghanton intjaar karaane ke baad bhi mohan prakaash unase nahin mili
 Then slogans started
 is bich ek doosraa ghatnakram aage bad chukaa tha
 After returning from abroad, Kamal Nath went to meet party president Sonia Gandhi
 isse is charchaa ko or bal mila ki unhen madhya pradesh congress ke adhyaksh pad kii jimmedaari saunpi ja sakati he
 Actually this discussion has been going on for several weeks
 ab jaakar use amali jama pehanaane kii taiyaari he
 This meeting is also being seen as an opportunity to present a report card as Kamal Nath as Haryana Incharge
 haryana main bhupinder singh hooda khemaa puri kaman apane haath main chahta he
 Not only does he want to bid farewell to Ashok Tanwar as the state president but also remove Kiran Chaudhary as the leader of the Congress Legislature Party
 laal pagadi ke khilaaf baari pad rahi gulabi pagadi kii is ladaai ko aise sulajhaa paanaa kamalnath ke liye ek badi chunauti he ki saanp bhi mar jaae or lathi bhi na toote
 Anyway, returning to Kamal Nath, he comes to the question of the new responsibility
 madhyapradesh ke adhyaksh arun yadav ko hataakar kamalnath ko kaman dene main sawaal yah tha ki jyotiraditya sindhiya ko is baat ke liye kaise taiyaar kiya jaae
 The post of Deputy Leader of the Lok Sabha Congress is vacant after Amarinder Singh became the Chief Minister of Punjab
 puri ummid he ki sindhiya ko upanetaa bana diya jaae
 There is also talk of making him General Secretary in Rahul's new team
 tippaniyan But the question is still that Scindia will leave his legacy of Madhya Pradesh as 'settle' in Delhi like this? That too when he was made the head of the campaign committee in 2013 elections, apart from the wishes of an old leader like Digvijay Singh
 ye alag baat he ki tab sindhiya party ko kamyaabi nahin dilaa paae
 Now elections are to be held there next year and in the hope of 15-year anti-incumbency of Shivraj Singh Chauhan, the Congress is looking at an opportunity to overturn power
 sindhiya ye mauka haath se jane dena nahin chahenge
 Especially when both the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and Delhi are still far away! ab AICC main hui narebaazi ko samajhane kii koshish karte hai
 a friend says that neither Kamal Nath nor Scindia want Mohan Prakash as in charge
 aise main kuch adane se kaaryakarta billi maar den to kya buraai he! kisi kaa naam bhi nahin aayega or kaam ho jayega
 Mohan Prakash is the incharge of Madhya Pradesh and Arun Yadav is the state Congress president
 madhyapradesh se eisisi pahunche kuch kaaryakarta donon par sthaneey sanghathan chunaav se pehle manamaane tareeke se saat block adhyaksh badalane kaa aarope laga rahe the
 He said that the organization elections have been announced in Madhya Pradesh, but before that seven block presidents have been replaced through whatsapp message
 yah kaaryakarta isi babat apni shikaayat lekar congress mukhyalay pahunche the
 He alleges that even after waiting for hours, Mohan Prakash did not meet him
 phir narebaaji shuru ho gai
 Meanwhile, a second development had taken place
 videsh se lautne ke baad kamalnath party adhyaksh sonia gandhi se milane pahunche
 This further strengthened the discussion that he could be given the responsibility of the post of president of Madhya Pradesh Congress
 darasal yah charchaa kai hafton se chal rahi he
 It is now ready to go and make him perform
 is meeting ko kamalnath ke bataur haryana incharge ek report card pesh karne ke maukey ke taur par bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 In Haryana, the Bhupinder Singh Hooda camp wants full command
 na sirf pradesh adhyaksh ke taur par vah ashok tanvar kii vidaai chahta he balki congress vidhayak dal kii netaa ke taur par kiran choudhary ko bhi hataanaa chahta he
 It is a big challenge for Kamal Nath to solve this battle of the pink turban, which is going on against the red turban, that even the snake dies and the sticks do not break
 kair, lautakar kamalnath ko nai milane vaali jimmedaari kii charchaa ke sawaal par aate hai
 In order to replace Kamal Nath with the removal of Madhya Pradesh President Arun Yadav, the question was how to prepare Jyotiraditya Scindia for this
 amarinder singh ke punjab kaa mukhyamantri banane ke baad loksabhaa congress ke upanetaa kaa pad khaali he
 There is every hope that Scindia is made the leader
 rahul kii nai ban rahi team main unhen mahasachiv banane kii bhi baat he
 The comments par sawaal phir bhi he ki sindhiya madhyapradesh kii apni viraasat ko is tarah dilli main 'settle' hokar chhod denge? vah bhi tab jab 2013 chunaav main ve digvijay singh jaise puraane netaa kii ichha se alag campan cameti ke pramukh banaae gaye the
 It is a different matter that Scindia could not make the party successful at that time
 ab agle saal vahaan chunaav hona he or shivaraj singh chouhan ke 15 saal ke anti inkambency kii ummid main congress apane liye satta palat kaa ek mauka dekh rahi he
 Scindia would not like to let go of this opportunity
 khaastaur par tab jab 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav or dilli donon abhi dur kii kaudi hai! Now let's try to understand the sloganeering in AICC
 ek mitra bataate hai ki mohan prakaash ko incharge ke taur par na to kamalnath chaahate hai na sindhiya
 In such a situation, what is the harm if the worker kills the cat with some help Nobody's name will come and work will be done
 is bich ek doosraa ghatnakram aage bad chukaa tha

 The much awaited talks will be held in New Delhi on 10 February

 Describing the first round of talks as a 'goodwill meeting', the ULFA Foreign Secretary said, "we have decided to hold the talks, respecting the wishes of the people of Assam and the ethnic Abhibartan (group of intellectuals)
" ’yah poochne par ki kyaulfaki mukhya maang ‘assam kii samprabhutaa’ par charchaa hogi to choudhary ne sidhaa jawaab dene se bachate hue kaha, ‘hamane bina shart vaarta karne kaa nirnay kiya he
 The process of resolving the problems of Assam will begin through dialogue
 ’ lekin sanghathan kii vivaadit maang ke bare main phir poochne par unhone kaha, ‘agar hamane phir se samprabhutaa kii maang uthaai to vaarta nahin hogi
 When asked if the ULFA had given up the demand, he said, "looking at the state of the state in 1979, we wanted sovereignty for Assam

 Now we should do what the people of Assam want

 He said that ULFA has not yet selected the leaders participating in the discussion
 unhone kaha, ‘hamaare maang kaa charter banaaya ja rahaa he

 12 hajaar 852 maamalon main to gharon main ek bhi mahila sadsy nahin pai gai
 - Out of 207 trains carrying ration goods, 42 were such trains, which were not registered with the Transport Department
 - aath gaadiyaan aisi thim, jinhone 1500 quintal se zyada rashan dhulaai kii, lekin unke registration number bas, tu whealer yaa thri whealer ke paae gaye
 - All ration card holders were to receive alerts on SMS, but in 2,453 cases the numbers came out of ration shopkeepers only
 - rashan se judi samasyaon ko lekar jo kol centre banaaya gaya, unamem saal 2013 se saal 2017 ke bich aae takreeban 16 lakh kol main sirf 42 fisadi kol kaa jawaab diya gaya
 - All officers were to conduct field inspections, but such inspections were not found in the audit
 - 412 rashan card aise paae gaye, jinamein parivaar ke ek sadsy kaa naam hi kai baar likhaa gaya tha
 - Ration is given only to those families who are poor, but more than a thousand cards also included the names of the servants, ie there are consumers who can keep servants

 The girl's family members had also complained to the hostel warden about this
 wardan ne teenon ko bulaakar samajhaayaa bhi tha ki is tarah kii maansik pratadna se baj aaen lekin senior maane nahin
 sc's historic verdict came on Ayodhya on November 9, the order of giving 5 acres of land in Ayodhya to Ramlalla Virajman, the owner of the disputed land, in Ayodhya itself
 chif justise ranjan gogoi kii aguwai main paanch jajon kii sanvaidhanik peeth ne faisla sunaate hue vivaadit jameen kaa asal maalik ramalala virajman ko mana he
 Along with this, the government has also been asked to decide the outline of temple construction by creating a trust within 6 months
 jabaki sunni vaff board ko court ne ayodhya main hi duusari jagah 5 acre jameen dene kaa aadesh diya he
 After the Supreme Court's decision, a dispute started between the saints and saints over the 'ayodhya Trust' to be built by the government regarding the construction of Ram temple
 vivaad ke bich ajtak ne ramnagari ke sabhi pramukh sadhu-santon ko ek manch par laane kii koshish kii
 Along with this, he also tried to know what his desire was for the construction of the temple
 kaarykram ke dauraan sabhisadhu-santon ne ek saath yah baat doharaai ki supreme court ke faisle ke baad jald se jald bhagwaan ram kaa mandir vahaan bananaa chahieor agar mandir nirmaan main deree he to kam se kam jis tent main bhagwaan ram rah rahe hai use hataakar vahaan garbh grih kaa nirmaan karvaa diya jaae
 Until later the temple can be built as long as possible
 darasal yah baat tab uthi jab purv saansad or shri ram janmabhumi nyaas ke sadsy ram vilaas vedanti ne yah baat kahi ki mandir 2024 tak banakar taiyaar ho jayega
 Actually in response to a question, Vedanti said, "on behalf of Narendra Modi, i am telling you, trust will be built within 3 months and after 3 months the process of temple construction will start and i think 5 years Inside this five-year plan, the temple will be built and Lord Rama will be enthroned in it
 unhone aage kaha, "2024 kaa chunaav mandir par ladaa jayega yaa nahin is par main bhavishyavaanee nahin kar saktaa lekin yah kah saktaa hum ki 2024 tak mandir kaa nirmaan ho jayega"
 After this, the chief priest of the Ramlala temple, Acharya Satyendra Das, clearly said that if there is more delay in the construction of the temple, Ramlala should be freed from the tents by first building at least the sanctum sanctorum
 is par raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 If Ramlala again stays in Tatapatti for 4-5 years, then such trust has no meaning
 ramalala ab tak tatapattee main rahe wo bahut hua
 After this, Dharmaguru Karpatri endorsed the talk of Acharya Satyendra Das that if there is talk of temple construction by 2024, then there is definitely some politics behind it
 main bas yahi kahana chaahunga ki ayodhya ke sant jald se jald ram mandir banataa dekhnaa chaahate hai
 The same thing was said by Mahant Raju Das of Hanuman Garhi
 unhone kaha, "avilamb tatapattee hataakar vahaan divyata barkaraar kii jaae
 We have nothing to do with trust
 4-5 saal ke pher main nahin padana
 It is requested to remove divinities and grant divinity, later you will continue to build the temple "
 dharmaguru paramhansadas ne kaha ki satyendra das ji ram ji kii vednaa samaj sakate hai kyonki ve hi donon vakt vahaan jaakar puraa-archana karte hai
 At least one temple can be built where Ramlala is seated
 ham chaahate hai ki aane vaali ramanavami main ham pakke garbhagrih main bhagwaan ram kaa darshan karen yahi prarthana he

 Hardik has been lodged in Surat Jail since his arrest last year in view of the violent agitation by Patels seeking reservation under the OBC category

 Opposing the plea, Hardik's lawyer Zubin Bharada said that Hardik would not mind if the High Court granted him bail on the condition that he stay out of Gujarat for the next six months
 is par amin ne kaha ki hardik ko gujarat ke baahar rakhane se kisi uddeshy kii purti nahin hogi kyonki vah soshal media plateform ke jariye apane samudaay ke sadasyon ko bhadakaana jari rakh sakate he

 hardik obisi shrenee ke tahat aarakshan kii maang ko lekar patelon ke hinsak andolan ke maddenjar pichley saal giraftaar ke baad se surat jail main band hai
 Opposing the bail plea, public prosecutor Mitesh Amin told the court that the government feared that Hardik might repeat his crime and his presence outside the jail could jeopardize the law and order situation in the state
 daleel kaa virodh karte hue hardik ke vakil jubin bharda ne kaha ki hardik ko is baat par aitraaj nahin hoga, bhale hi ucch nyaayalay unhen is shart par jamaanat de ki vah agle chah maheene ke liye gujarat se baahar rahen
 To this, Amin said that keeping Hardik out of Gujarat will not serve any purpose as he can continue to incite members of his community through social media platforms

 It is noteworthy that during the previous hearings, the government refused to accept Hardik's offer of written affidavit for bail

 Jai Hind 🙏🇮🇳❤️A post shared byvicky Kaushal(@vickykaushal09) onjan 10, 2019 at 9:47pm pstviki kaushal kii film ke bare main twit karte hue taran adarsh ne kaha tha ki uri ab bhi cinemagharon kaa rukh karne vaale logon ke liye pehali pasand bani hui he or baaki release hui filmon ko kadi chunauti de rahi he
 This film has been included in the selected films, which does not have much difference between the box office collections of the first week and the second week
 simba, manikarnika or thakare kii relies kaa film par koi khaas fark nahin padaa tha or film ne relies ke pehle hafte main 71
 26 crores and then 62 in the second week
 77 karod kii kamai kii thi
 Apart from this, the film has maintained its pace even in the third and fourth weeks
 film kaa naam:pyaar kaa panchnaama 2diarector:lav ranjanster cast:karthik aryan, nushrat bharucha, sani singh nijjar, sonaali sahagal, onkaar kapur or ishita sharmivadhi:136 minutesrtificate:erreting:3
 5 star director Luv Ranjan made the film 'pyaar Ka Panchnama' in 2011, which was well received by the audience
 2 saal baad 'akaash vaani' bhi lekar aae jise janata ne nakaar diya or ab pyaar kaa panchnaama 2 relies hui he
 Will the audience like the love of atrocities on men in this film, like the first part? Kahani This is the story of three friends Anshul 'gogo' (karthik Aryan), Siddharth aka 'chauka' (sunny Singh) and Tarun alias Thakur (omkar Kapoor), who have girls named Ruchika aka Chiku (nushrat Bharucha), Supriya (sonali Sehgal) and Kusum (ishita Sharma) respectively in their lives
 ab in teen couples kii jindagi kis tarah se ishk mohabbat pyaar se guzarati he or kin-kin baton se ladakon ko ladakiyon kii upasthiti pareshaan karti he, use film main darshaya gaya he
 Scriptfilmki script has been kept inspired by men's pain
 ek baar phir se rosemara kii jajindagi main hone vaali ghatnao ko kalam se utarkar parde par dikhaane kii koshish kii gai he
 What girls like and when their mood gets disturbed, it has also been narrated on the basis of different dialogues
 pichhali vaali film kii tarah hi is baar bhi ek bada monolog he jise karthik tiwari parform karte hue najar aate hai
 The names of the characters in the film are also quite different such as Gogo, Chauka and Thakur
 film kaa plot pichhali film se hi miltaa-julata he lekin is baar kahani ko outdoor ke najaare or sajaate hai
 From the meeting of the three couples, there are also different flavors of flirtation and nozzle
 aajkal kii tej tarraar jindagi main couples ke jivan ko maddenjar rakhkar yah kahani likhi gai he
 Acting three couples have done well, and whatever flavor the director has given to these three couples, the performance is also visible in that realm
 jahaan ek taraf karthik or nushrat ke kapal vaale kisse hai jise donon ne kirdaar main rah kar bakhub nibhaayaa he vahiin sani singh kii kamedi se bhare samvaad or abhinay bhi hansaate hai
 The performances of Sonali Sehgal and Ishita Sharma and Omkar are commendable
 film ek edlt kahani he jisaki vajah se glamras shot dene ke liye bhi teenon abhinatriyon ne kaaphi sahaj kaam kiya he
 The music of the musicfilm has been kept according to the three couples, although if some songs were not there, the film would have been faster
 kamjor kadifilm kii kamjor kadi isaki lambaai he, agar ikkaa-dukka geeton yaa sikvence ko chota rakhaa jaataa to shaayad film or bhi crisp or cat-tu-cat hoti
 Why see if you are an adult and are in a relationship or married, then you can definitely watch this film once because seeing the actors acting you cannot say at all that they are not expert in their art
 ham sab jaanate hai ki jab bhartiya angreji bolte hai to wo shuddh angreji nahin hoti he
 It is a mixture of Hindi and sometimes local languages
 jaane bhartiya bhashaaon se prabhavit angreji main prayog hone vaale kuch shabdon kaa udhaaharan ham aapako de rahe hai:1
 Indians often ask- 'what is your' good 'name?' This sentence is not in English
 lekin 'good name' kaa prachlan kahaan se shuru hua ye jaananaa rochak he
 In Hindi there is a practice of saying "what is your auspicious name?"
 'shubh' shabd izzat ke taur par kaha jaataa he
 '2
 bahut se log 'this morning' or 'last night' kii jagah 'today morning' (aaj subah) or 'yesterday night' (kal raat) kaa prayog karte hai, jo ki galat he
 3
 jab ham ek se adhik logon ko sambodhit karte hai to 'you people' kehete hai, jiskaa koi matlab nahin he
 But we have become so accustomed to these words that we do not realize our mistake
 4
 What do most women wear while sleeping at night? You will say - 'nighty'
 ye shabd galat he
 Actually, we have 'night-gowned' the night at our convenience
 5
 Egg-lovers' favorite breakfast 'french toast' is not actually French
 france main ise 'french toast' ke naam se janaa jaataa he lekin bharat main aisi koi dish hi nahin he
 6
 'ye meraa dimag kha rahaa he'- bhartiya gusse main ye vaakya bahut bolte hai, lekin ye angreji ke 'he's / she's eating my brains' kaa shabdash: anuwaad he
 It makes no sense and it looks funny
 7
 If you ask an Indian "where are you from?" Then you will get a common answer "I belong to Delhi"
 ye bhale hi aapke apane shahar ke prati aapke prem ko dikhaae lekin angreji main aisa koi vaakya nahin hota
 Another answer to the same question - "I am from Delhi only" can also be
 hindi main ''main dilli se hi hum'' kaha jaataa he
 This 'hee' is done in the literal translation only, which is absolutely wrong
 8
 'foreign-return' is often used for a person studying or working from abroad
 angreji main aisa koi shabd nahin hota
 9
 'is kaam ke liye meraa bos mere sir par baitha he' ko angreji main bolte samay 'my boss is sitting on my head for this assignment' kah diya jaataa he
 This is also a very funny translation
 10
 Many people, when referring to their names in English, say 'myself, Rahul' instead of 'I Rahul', which is incorrect English
 yahaan bataa den ki ek baar main keval do kilo tuar daal graahak ko dene ke liye kaha gaya he
 Rajiv Gandhi was the youngest Prime Minister of the country from 1984 to 1991 after the assassination of Indira Gandhi
 in paanch varshon main hi is yuva pradhanmantri ne apane kaaryon se desh kii janata ke dilodimag main amit chhap chodi
 He did many such works for a single term, for which he is remembered even today
 yuva soch vaale rajeev gandhi ko 21 veen sadi ke bharat kaa nirmaataa bhi kaha jaataa he
 Rajiv Gandhi, who became Prime Minister in 40 years, worked towards laying the foundation of modern India
 duurarasanchaar krantiyah rajeev gandhi hi the, jinhone bharat main doorsanchaar kranti laai
 Today, Rajiv Gandhi had conceptualized the digital India that is discussed today
 unhen digital india kaa architect or soochna takanic or doorsanchaar kranti kaa janak kaha jaataa he
 In August 1984, on the initiative of Rajiv Gandhi, the Center for Development of Telematics (C-DOT) was established to establish the Indian telecom network
 is pahal se shahar se lekar gaanvon tak doorsanchaar kaa jaal bichana shuru hua
 pcos started opening up everywhere
 jisase gaanv kii janata bhi sanchaar ke maamle main desh-duniya se jud saki
 Then in 1986, MTNL was established with Rajiv's initiative, which led to further progress in the telecom sector
 vot dene kii umr seemaa ghatipehle desh main vot dene kii umraseema 21 varsh thi
 But in the eyes of young Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, this age limit was wrong
 unhone 18 varsh kii umr ke yuvaaon ko matadhikaar dekar unhen desh ke prati or jimmedaar tathaa shashakt banane kii pahal kii
 In 1989, through the 61st Amendment of the Constitution, the voting age was reduced from 21 to 18 years
 is prakaar ab 18 varsh ke karodon yuva bhi apana saansad, vidhayak se lekar anya nikaayon ke janpratinidhiyon ko chun sakate the
 In the computer revolution, the first computers were far from the reach of common people
 magar rajeev gandhi ne apane vaigyanik mitra sam pitroda ke saath milakar desh main computer kranti laane kii disha main kaam kiya
 Rajiv Gandhi believed that industries could not grow without the help of science and technology
 unhone computer tak aam jan kii pahunch ko aasaan banane ke liye computer upkarnon par aayaat shulk ghatana kii pahal kii
 The computerized system of ticket issuance in Indian Railways was also due to these initiatives
 haalanki rajeev gandhi ke pradhanmantri banane se pehle 1970 main desh main public sector main computer divijan shuru karne ke liye department of electronics kii shuruyaat ho gai thi
 IBM was the first company until 1978, later the second private sector companies started computer manufacturing
 panchayaton ko kiya shashaktapanchayatiraj se judi sansthaaen majbootee se vikaas kaary kar saken, is soch ke saath rajeev gandhi ne desh main panchayatiraj vyavastha ko shashakt kiya
 Rajiv Gandhi believed that till the Panchayati Raj system is not strengthened, democracy cannot reach the lower level
 unhone apane kaarykaal main panchayatiraj vyavastha kaa puraa prastaav taiyaar karaayaa
 a year after the assassination on 21 May 1991, Rajiv Gandhi's thinking was realized when the Panchayati Raj system emerged through the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments in 1992
 rajeev gandhi kii sarkaar kii ore se taiyaar 64 wein samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak ke aadhaar par narsimha raav sarkaar ne 73 waan samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak paarit karaayaa
 Panchayati Raj system came into force throughout the country from 24 April 1993
 jisase sabhi rajyon ko panchayaton ke chunaav karaane ko majaboor hona padaa
 The purpose of the Panchayati Raj system was decentralization of power
 khole navoday vidhyalayamaujuuda samay desh main khule 551 navoday vidyalayon main 1
 Over 80 lakh students are studying
 gaanvon ke bacchon ko bhi utkrisht shiksha mili, is soch ke saath rajeev gandhi ne jawahar navoday vidyalayon kii neenv daali thi
 These are residential schools
 pravesh pariksha main safal medhaavi bacchon ko in skulon main pravesh miltaa he
 Children get free education from 6th to 12th and stay in hostels
 rajeev gandhi ne shiksha kshetra main bhi krantikari upaay kiye
 His government announced the National Education Policy (NPE) in 1986
 iske tahat puure desh main ucch shiksha vyavastha kaa aadhunikeekaran or vistaar hua
 BSP Suuprimo Mayawati has said that at the Telangana Encounter it is said that Uttar Pradesh and Delhi Police should take inspiration from this

 haryana ke sarsabj hisar shahar se 32 kimi uttar main based barwaala kasbe main jindagi dharre par laut ai he
 The week-long news channel, police and the explosion of cars blowing the dust of spectacles are over
 ek shaks ko, jo khud ko bhaktikaal ke mahaan nirgun sant kabirdaas kaa avatar kahata tha or jiske chamache use desh ke kanoon or samvidhan se upar bataa rahe the, ek chuuhe kii tarah giraftaar kar police kii vine main bithakar kalkothri main bhej diya gaya
 But the spectacle in the 12-acre Killenuma Satlok Ashram, under the protection of black-clad gunman guards, killed both the dignity and sleep of the Haryana Police, as well as the persistence of Baba Rampal that killed six people, including an innocent child
 darjanon gadipoon main aag lagi or patrakaron kii barbar pitayee hui, so alag
 The relief is that 15,000 people trapped in the ashram were safely evacuated without any major power usage
 lekin yah sab hua kyon? aath saal pehle rohtak jile ke karauntha ke satalok ashram main isi tarah kaa bavaal karne ke baad kareeb dedh saal jail main rah chuke is baba ko dobaaraa itani takat kahaan se mil gai? karauntha se bhagaae jane ke baad usne hisar main pehle se kahin bada samrajya kaise bana liya? or aakhir vah kis dam par rajya kii puri mashinari ko chunauti dene laga (dekhen boxh rampal ke abhedya kile kaa raaj)? upar se dekhne par lagata he ki baba mahaj sanak main aisa kar rahaa tha, lekin haryana ke saamaajik taane-bane or raajnneeti ke paimaane se dekhen to baba kaa nasha galat nahin tha
 In fact, the interference of deras in Haryana's politics has increased considerably in the last decade
 jat banaam gaiyr jat, jat banaam dalit, sikh banaam dalit sikh, aryasamaji banaam kabirpanthi, inke alaava bhi aise bahut-se sameekaran hai jo haryana ke samaaj or raajnneeti par gaharaa asar rakhte hai
 Dalits and other backward castes, who had been marginalized for centuries in this divided society, started looking towards these deras, or new sects, which began in the 1940–50s
 in deron ne ek ishwar kii puja par jor diya or insaan-insaan ke bich barabari kii baat kahi
 Later, these dera also raised the issue of special attraction to women like de-addiction
 rampal ke ashram se nikle 15,000 bhakton kii profile dekhen to unamem se zyaadaatar log samaaj ke vanchit tabakon se hai
 As the number of devotees increases, the leaders start seeing vote banks in these camps and the more the governments turn the face
 (police hiraasat main rampal)adaalat sakht, sarkaar sustajat samudaay ke rampal ke rishte bhi kabhi jat netaa or tatkaaleen congressi mukhyamantri bhupinder singh hudddha ke saath madhur the
 But in October 2006 when Rampal made a disproportionate comment about Satyarth Prakash, the supreme text of the Aryasamaj, most of the Aryasamaji Jats of Rohtak turned against him and Huddha of the Aryasamaji family himself was forced to drive Rampal out of Rohtak
 raajnneeti ke is vyavahaarganit ke bich adaalat rampal ke saath sakhti se pesh ai
 He did not get bail for a year and three months after appearing in court
 iske baavjood rampal ke logon kaa daawa he ki is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav se kuch din pehle hudddha ne baba se cese hatwane kaa vaada kiya tha
 For this, six people from the ashram also met him at Hoodha's Delhi residence
 haalanki cese hate nahin
 But the new BJP government also did not show much interest in opening Baba's file
 vah to ek baar phir punjab or haryana hycourt ne avmaananaa maamle ko puri gambhirtha se liya
 Then Baba got caught after so much drama
 sarkaar ab rampal par deshadroh sahit 20 dhaaraon main mukadmaa darj kara rahi he
 (the state-of-the-art pandal with a seating capacity of more than 5,000 people at the Satlok Ashram in Barwala) The dera has a strong reason for the silence of the government
 isaki ek misaal yah he ki jab puure desh kii nigahen sarson ke kheton ke bich based barwaala ke satalok ashram par thim, tab sattadhari bijepi ke kai mantri or vidhayak haryana main party ke chunaav prabharee rahe kailash vijayawargeey or vidhansabha adhyaksh kanvarpal gurjar ke netritv main sirsa ke deraa sachcha sauda main sant gurmeet ram rahim insa ko dhanyavad gyaapit karne pahunche
 This most influential dera is believed to have 50 lakh devotees in Haryana
 hatya, yon shoshan or haal hi main apane 150 sevakon ko jabaran napunsak banane ke aaropon kaa haryana or punjab kii alag-alag adaalaton main saamana kar rahe jed plus surakshadhari baba ne pichley vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi kaa khulkar samarthan kiya tha
 Even before the election, bjp's 45 candidates had reached Baba as soon as the list was released
 barwaala cond ke bich bijepi netaaon kaa thok main deraa sachcha sauda pahunchnaa, usee ehsaan kaa shukrana adaa karnaa tha
 Dera spokesperson Pawan Insa explains, “it is wrong to weigh everyone in one of the scales because of a Baba getting into a dispute
 guruji garibon ke liye makaan banane se lekar veshyaaon ke ghar basaane tak 104 pramukh saamaajik kaaryon se jude hai
 All these allegations are baseless
 ham adaalat main inkaa jawaab de rahe hai
 Insa rotatingly commented on political influence, "we are not directly concerned with politics, but there are 5 crore dera lovers in the country
" netaa aate hai to guruji aashirwad dete hai
 (haryana Police officer photographed sitting on Baba's throne) On the other hand, Dera Bhumanshah Sangarsadha of Sirsa has a significant impact in the most backward Kambose community
 deraa vaise to raajnneeti main bahut sakriy nahin he, lekin om prakaash chautaala ke indian neshnal lokdal se iskaa virodh jagajaahir he
 Land dispute has been going on for a long time on both sides
 aise main deraa hameshaa ieneldi ko haraane vaale dal ko samarthan detaa he
 Till the last election, the Congress used to benefit from it, but in the new wind the blessings fell in the bjp's jhauli
 yah alag baat he ki in donon deron ke samarthan or sant ram-rahim ke pehali baar vot daalane jane ke baavjood sirsa main bijepi paanchon vidhaan sabha siten haar gai
 Parallel to this camp, Dera Sacha Sauda is Jagmalali in Sirsa
 yahaan bhi shraddhaluon or netaaon kaa aana-janaa laga rahata he
 If these camps are for the shelter of Dalits, then people of Sikhism are associated with the Namdhari sect
 dere kaa raag shuruyaat se hi congress ke saath rahaa he or yah is chunaav main bhi jari rahaa
 However, the dera never does open political rhetoric
 iske alaava haryana main radhaswami satsang vyas or satnami deron kaa bhi vyapak asar he
 According to an estimate, there are more than 2,000 small and large camps in Haryana and almost every seat is considered as a game changer
 30 siten to aisi hai jin par sirf deraa sachcha sauda kii rajnatik apil kaa khaasaa asar mana jaataa he
 Apart from these deras, Baba Man Singh's dera at Pahova in Kurukshetra district supported the INLD in the election
 karoda kaa sant rampal ashram, ambala ke swami gyananand kaa ashram, mandivala baba kaa deraa or uske baad isckon or shri shri ravishankar kaa art of living bhi chunavi bhoomika main peeche nahin rahe
 (gurmeet Ram Rahim Insa) On the pile of gunpowder, this question will remain in place whether the Manohar Lal Khattar government will not have to face two-four cases like Barwala
 2006 main sant rampal ke rohtak ashram main hua isi tarah kaa bavaal or 2008 main guru govind singh jaisi veshbhusha pahanane ke kaaran sant ram rahim ke bhakton or sikhon ke bich haryana kii sadakon par hua khooni sangharsh bataata he ki kai baar dere apane aap ko samaantar satta samajhane lagate hai
 More than five cases of serious cases are still going on on ram-rahim, the rest of the camp is also struggling with property dispute
 haryana ke zyaadaatar ashram or deron ke mukhiya atyaadhunik hathiyaaron se las nijee gardon ke saath chalanaa pasand karte hai
 In these sensitive circumstances, if the government allows the babas to go on a path of rhetoric for votes, then the heat will be once again on the threshold because the courts are not going to tolerate anyone

 Recently it was revealed from the reports that instant messaging app whatsapp will soon launch digital payment in India
 lekin ab khabar yah he ki swadeshi instent miseging ap Hike whatsap se pehle hi digital pement launch karne kii taiyaari main he
 According to reports, Chinese Internet giant Tencent has invested venture capital funds to bring payment service to Hike
 yani agar company ne aisa kiya to Hike pehla swadeshi massenger hoga jisamen digital pement kaa bhi feechar diya jayega
 In the past year, Tencent and Foxconn have invested $ 175 million in Hike
 reports ke mutabik Hike apane massenger main UPI placeform ko link karke pement system shuru karegi
 Experts believe that whatsapp will take at least six months to launch its payment platform
 lekin Hike kaa pement system ban kar taiyaar he or ise jald hi launch kiya ja saktaa he
 If you have used wechat or heard its name, then you probably know that its parent company is Tencent
 gauratlab he ki wechat china ke sabase bade massenger besd bement system main se ek he or yah Hike ke liye kaaphi madadgaar sabit ho saktaa he
 Obviously, to link UPI platform in Messenger, the company will need to join many banks
 isliye Hike bhartiya bainkon ke saath bhi qaraar kar saktaa he
 However, the company has not yet officially announced it

 On the other hand, political accusations on this step of RBI have intensified
 vipakshi dal reserve bank ke sarkari khajaane ke liye paise dene par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 Explain that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) accepted 1 of its surplus and reserve reserves on Monday, following the recommendations of an expert committee headed by former chairman Bimal Jalan
 76 lakh karod rupee centre sarkaar ko die jane ko manzuri de di
 This record transfer, in which 1 for the year 2018-19
 23 lakh karod rupee kaa sarplus shaamil he, se sarkaar kii vittiya sthiti aise samay main majboot ho paaegi, jab vah lagbhag paanch saal main sabase kam aarthik vruddhi kaa saamana kar rahi he or lagbhag har kshetra main lakhon naukariyaan khatm ho jane kii ashanka sir par jhul rahi he
 In addition, this payment would help the government reduce the fiscal deficit to 3 of the gross domestic product (GDP)
 3 fisadi tak simit rakhane ke mahatvakankshi lakshya ko bhi puraa kar paaegi
 Economists believe that this payment will also help the government to deal with the decrease in tax revenue, and will also be able to raise funds for its increased expenses
 udhar, congress ke purv adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne desh kii aarthik sthiti ko lekar centre kii narendra modi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that the solution to the economic crisis created by PM Modi and the Finance Minister is not being understood
 isko lekar unhone twit kiya, 'pradhanmantri tathaa vittamantri khud ke paidaa kiye hue aarthik sankat ko hal karne ke bare main kuch samaj nahin paa rahe hai
 
 
 Stealing from the RBI will not work - it is exactly the same as stealing a band-aid from the dispensary to apply a bullet wound
 
 At the same time, the Congress held a fierce attack on the government by holding a press conference and alleged that there are conditions like economic emergency in the country
 modi sarkaar desh ko kangaali kii ore dhakel rahi he
 The Congress claimed that it symbolized a deep crisis in the economy
 RBI ne dabaav main liya he ye faisalaa
 Congress said that the decision to reserve cash is wrong
 party ke netaa anand sharma ne kaha, sarkaar ghate main he, bajet galat bana diya
 What was given to the poor is not given
 
 
 haalat bahut buree he, isliye arabiai kaa paisa sarkaar chin rahi he or desh ko iconamik emaregaunsy kii taraf dhakela ja rahaa he"
 On the other hand, former Reserve Bank Director Vipin Malik told NDTV that the government should not use this fund for capital investment but to make up for its losses

 sutara bataate hai ki lalu-nitish kii partiyon ne congress ko vidhaan parishad chunaav kii tarj par nayaa prastaav diya he
 Under this, the Congress has been asked to declare its candidates on 30 of the 40 seats in the party's account in the Grand Alliance
 iske peeche tark he ki congress ke 30 pratyaashee hi majboot hai
 Under the new proposal, Lalu and Nitish want the Congress to give JDU and RJD candidates under its banner on the remaining 10 seats on their account
 yani 5 siton par jediu or 5 siton par argedy ke pratyaashee congress ke chunaav chinh par ummidavaari karen
 On the other hand, the Congress is said to be very angry with this new proposal

 Union Home Secretary GK Pillai said on Sunday, "we are considering sending a team to America to interrogate lashkar-e-taiba terrorist Headley, his wife and others and to collect evidence and for this we have to be sent to the US authorities
 Have to talk to ’pillai ne patrakaron ke saath mulaakaat main kaha, ‘hamen is maamle ke puure sakshya jutaney hai
 We cannot call them here because the request to allow Headley's wife to be interrogated is still under consideration by the US

 Headley's statement must be factually acceptable
 yah puche jane par ki kya bharat ko poochtacha ke liye dal bhejne se pehle america se uski anumati leni hogi ,unhone kaha, ‘haa, ek baar hedli ke khilaaf aaropapatr daakhil ho jaae, aage kii kanoonee prakriya shuru kar di jaaegi

 'he said,' America made an agreement with David Headley
 is samjhaute main kaha gaya he ki use bharat pratyrpit nahin kiya jayega
 On this issue, we made it clear to the US at the level of consultation that they are making this agreement in a case in which not only Indians, but also Americans have been killed
 ’ hedli ne bharat main aatankwaadi hamale kii sajeesh samet sabhi 12 aaropon par dosha sweekaar kar liya he
 After this he also entered into a plea bargain agreement with the American authorities
 pli bargen samjhaute ke tahat hedli ko aise kisi bhi aparaadh ke liye, jiske liye usne dosha sweekaar kar liya he, bharat, pakistan yaa denmark pratyrpit nahin kiya jayega

 Nahid Afreen achieved fame in singing from a talent show two years ago, but Dharma Guru is preventing this teenager from singing on the public stage
 gauratlab he ki aapreen ne lokapriy rielti sho indian ydal main apni gayikee se naam kamaaya tha
 He has sung a song in Sonakshi Sinha's film 'akira', as well as his singing hymns, which earned him a lot of popularity in Assam
 tippaniyan Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who led the BJP government in the state, has said that 'we condemn this move of the institutions which prevent talented singer Nahid Afreen from singing on the public stage
 ' twitor par hi sonoval ne yah bhi likhaa he ki 'nahid se baat kii he or hamane kalakaaron ko suraksha muhaiyaa karne ke apane vaade ko doharaaya he
 ' nahid ne kaha he ki 'pehali baar fatve ke bare main sunakar dhakka laga lekin phir mujhe kai musalmaan gayakon se prerana mili jiske baad maine tay kiya ki main sangeet ko kabhi nahin chhoduungi

 Whenever the crisis on Sanatan Dharma deepens and all hopes are gone
 
 Then and again they come
 
 Fight the last battle of defense
 wo tab bhi aate hai jab-jab desh khatare main hota he
 Or the attackers raised their heads
 raakh se lipte hue
 Commando with no clothes
 jinke maathe pe tilak, hatho me trishul or ankhon main gussa hota he
 Saying every har Mahadev who is ready to die on religion and country
 
 
 vahi hai kumbh ke commando
 He is obstinate with karma and a protector of religion
 wo dikhne main rahasy or man se sadhu hai
 He is the watchman of culture and culture
 khun main unke junun or dil main desh he
 He is none other than the commandos of Sanatan Dharma
 lekin wo aate kahaan se hai
 Where do they go unki duniya kisi hoti he
 In which world do they get lost
 ye koi nahin jaanata
 Everyone just knows that when the Kumbh or Ardh Kumbh comes, Naga sadhus are seen in the world in millions
 lekin jab kumbh-kumbh ho jaataa he to wo sabake sab achaanak aise gaayab ho jate hai, jaise kabhi the hi nahin
 Before solving the tilasma of the Nagas, let us tell you that the Nagas appearing in the Kumbh are about to go missing once again
 isse pehle ki ye phir laapata ho jaaen inhen dekh lijie
 Understand
 
 After 45 days of Kalpavas in the Kumbh Mela, preparations have begun to visit the city of Kashi, the city of Baba Vishwanath
 kaashi main ye ganga ghaaton ke saath akhaadon ke mathon main deraa daalenge
 According to tradition, all the akharas will remain a mystery once they stay in Varanasi till Holi
 to isse pehle ki ye phir se rahasy ban jaaen aaiye jaanate hai ki aakhir kya he naga sanyas kaa tilism? kya he naga sanyas kaa rahasy? or koun hote hai naga sadhu? aaj ham aapako lekar chalenge naga saadhuon ke sansar main, or sunaayenge naga sanyaasiyon ke rahasyalok kii kahani
 It is said that the present form of Indian Sanatana Dharma was started by Adiguru Shankaracharya
 unka janm aathvin sadi main hua or un dinon hindustan kii haalat itani acchhee nahin thi
 The immense wealth of the country was continuously pulling foreign invaders here
 sankat sanathan dharm par bhi tha
 In such a situation, Shankaracharya established four benches in the name of Govardhan Peeth, Sharada Peeth, Dwarka Peeth and Jyotirmath Peeth for Sanatan Dharma and laid the foundation of the akharas for the protection of religion
 pehle-pahal in akhaadon se dharm raksha ke liye kuch karne kii ichha rakhanevaale noujvaan jude, jinhone vyaayaam or kasarat ke zarie pehle khud ko majboot kiya or dushmano se loha liya
 But then these arenas were transformed into ashrams that teach disinterest
 raashtra or dharm kii seva ke liye akhaadon se judanevaale log ghar sansar se katane lage
 And the Naga tradition was born
 bhagwaan shiv or agni ko apana aradhy maanane vaale in naga saadhuon ne apni alag hi duniya basaa lee
 Away from society and general public life, these Nagas who lived in mountains and caves very difficult and ascetic lives started to get involved in spiritual practice and from then till today their life has been surrounded by many such mysteries
 naga naa to sansaarik jivan jite, naa hi koi vastra pahante hai
 Their food was the fruit and flower, and the sky was their dress
 or aaj bhi yahi sadhak is kumbh ke meley kaa sabase bada aakarshan hai
 Full body wrapped in ghosts
 ankho main har vakt dahakate aadhyatmik shakti ke sholay
 Tripund on the forehead
 rudraksh se sushobhit bhujaaon main shiv shakti pratik trishul or pathar se chehre par bhole shankar kii jai jayakaar kaa bhav, sanathan dharm ke is prachand prajjwalit rup ko hi duniya naga sanyasi kahati he
 But before taking the decision to become a Naga, he got the temptation of his family
 dost yaar kaa sang
 Everyone has to leave
 yahaan tak ki inhen apana itihaas mitaane ke liye khud kaa antim sanskaar bhi karnaa padataa he
 Sanskar of one's own Shraddha at your own hands
 sanskaar khud ke pindadaan kaa
 Pinddan of his last 14 generations and finally Pinddan himself
 taaki duniya ke har rishte se aglaa-pichhlaa hisaab samaapt ho jaae
 They are then given Naga initiation, where two types of Naga Sadhus are prepared
 ek digambar naga sadhu
 Second Sri Digambara Naga Sadhu
 digambar naga sadhu ek langot dhaaran karne ke alaava or koi kapadaa nahin pahante
 Whereas the Sadhus who take initiation of Shri Digambara remain completely naked
 sabase mushkil shri digambar naga sadhu bananaa hi hota he kyonki tab sanyam or brahmacharya par date rahane ke liye unki sabhi indriyaan nasht kar di jaati he
 The saints, who are naked, rub ash on the whole body
 isaki bhi do vajahen hoti hai
 One is the symbol of impermanence, and the other works as a cover, so that the devotees will not hesitate to come near
 
 The ash which the Naga Sadhus wrap is often the ashes of the dead taken from the pyre, and sometimes the ash of the fumigant in front of which they are sitting is rubbed

 Delhi Metro may provide world class facilities to the passengers, but there are linguistic mistakes in metro stations
 metro ke yatra maanchitr par jagahon ke naam or steshnon kii sanket bhashaa kaa sawaal aata he to is maamle main abhi bhi dilli metro ko kaaphi kuch kiya janaa apekshit he
 In fact, many of these names have either been spelled incorrectly or pronounced differently in different places
 udhaaharan ke liye kendriya sachivalay metro stesan ke aage sthit ‘chamsford club’ kaa naam metro stesan ke get number 1 par 'chams ford club' likhaa gaya he
 This gate opens towards the Red Cross route
 vahiin get number 2 par ise ‘chams ford club’ likhaa gaya he
 This amateur club of the colonial era was formed in the year 1916-17 and was named after Lord Chelmsford, the then Viceroy of India
 nai dilli railway stesan ke nikat ek pramukh maarg kaa namakaran bhi inke naam par kiya gaya he
 However, this is not only on the 'violet Line' service of the Delhi Metro, but at Mandi House station, just two stations ahead of the Central Secretariat, the name of one such celebrity has been wrongly spelled
 mandi house metro stesan par varsh 1930 ke dashak kii aitihaasik imaarat ‘ladi irvin college’ ke sanket chihn main irvin shabd main angreji ke ‘w’ ke sthaan par angreji ke ‘V’ akshar ko likhaa gaya he
 The building is named after Lady Dorothy Irwin, wife of Lord Irwin, former Viceroy of India
 isi stesan kii diwaar par ‘bhagwaan das road’ ke sanket chihn ko likhane main bhi angreji kii vahi galati doharaai gai he
 In 'bhagwan' of 'bhagwan Das Road', the letter 'V' of English has been written in place of 'w', but these mistakes are not limited only to the walls but also on the 'LED Travel Map' of the metro train
 Looks like
 stesan ke baahar sanket chihnon par inhen kisi or tareeke se likhaa gaya he, jabaki train ke andar ‘elidi yatra maanchitr’ par inhen kisi or tareeke se likhaa gaya he
 For example, the name 'jangpura' station is written near the track and 'jangpura' in the wall signs, while inside the train coach they are written as 'jung Pura', a combination of two words
 yahi galati ‘moolchand’ ke naam ke saath bhi doharaai gai he
 When asked about the mistakes, Delhi Metro said, 'improvement will be done soon in this regard
 ' dmarsi ke jansampark vibhaag ke adhikari ne kaha, 'hamane is maamle ko sangyaan main le liya he
 We have identified incorrectly written signs outside the stations and these mistakes will be rectified soon

 'it has written,' many women have made allegations against Trump and we cannot ignore it

 ' The Pakistan Army is now saying that the sacrificing of living Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) for us is a mere sacrifice of soldiers for them, according to the Islam Today-sacrificed martyrdom of Pakistan military propaganda platform martyrs on the backfoot
 The figure is not there
 darasal india today open-sorce investigation ne apni report main tathyon ke saath khulaasa kiya tha ki kis tarah pakistan niyantran rekha par hone vaaleen apane hi javaanon kii maut par pardaa daalata rahaa
 Pakistan Army spokespersons are on the backfoot following an India Today report
 pravaktaa kii ore se dabe shabdon main jo kaha ja rahaa he wo ek tarah se india today kii report ke tathyon par hi muhar laga rahaa he
 The spokesman of the Pakistani army says that the casualty of the soldiers is not a matter of statistics for them
 rawalpindi main buudhvaar ko ek press conference main pakistani sena ke pravaktaa major general asif gafoor ne kaha, 'ye aankadon kaa maamla nahin he
 If 20-25 thousand people have sacrificed for Pakistan, then it is not only related to statistics, it is about humanity
 islam ke siddhant ke mutabik wo hamaare liye jivit hai
 Instead of giving a direct answer to the question of hiding the death toll of Pakistani soldiers, ISPR Director General Ghafoor tried to cover the curtain by taking the sentiment route
 major general gafoor ne kaha, tain logon (pakistani sainikon) ne hamaare liye apni jaan qurbaan kii
 He left his family behind here
 unke yahaan mata-pita hai, bachche hai
 i appeal to every Pakistani to reach the families of these martyrs in their respective areas
 saath hi shaheedon ko yaad rakhane ke liye unki tasviren lagaaein
 "the Pakistani Army celebrates 'martyr Day' on September 6 every year and the sacrifice of those martyrs will go in vain if Pakistani citizens do not go to their homes," Ghafoor said
 'haalanki press conference main maujuud kisi bhi patrkaar ne india today kii report ke bare main sawaal nahin kiya tha lekin gafoor ne khud hi sawaal-jawaab kaa satr khatm hone par bayaan diya
 Earlier, Gafoor shared the link of India Today Broadcast and said that it is the passion of Indian media for 'ISPR'
 india today open-sorce investigation ne apni report main pakistani sena ke thithivaar (historical) data kaa har din media ko di jane vaali jaankaree se milan kiya or inamen aapas main hi kaaphi antar paaya
 The investigation revealed that the death of Pakistani soldiers along the Line of Control was mentioned in the historical data but it was hidden in daily statements
 india today kii report ke duusare hisse main croud-sorcd data ke jariye dikhaaya gaya ki pakistani sena kii ore se niyantran rekha par july se agast ke bich kai jawan hataahat hue
 But ISPR did not publicly admit it
 obsarwar research foundation ke senior faillo sushant sareen ne india today ke khulaase par kaha, 'wo kyon apane javaanon kii mauton ko saarvajanik taur par kabool nahin karte, iske peeche kaaran he
 If they start doing this, then it will be a big embarrassment for the Pakistani Army
 pakistani sena khud par aparajeyata kaa mulammaa chadha hua dikhaae rakhana chaahati he jabaki asaliyat main use kaafii munh kii khaani padati he
 According to Sarin, the Pakistani army did the same during the Kargil War

 ' dilli kii ek adaalat ne 1984 ke sikh virdohi danga maamle main congress netaa sajjan kumaar ko koi raahat nahin dete hue buudhvaar ko unke khilaaf gaiyr jamaanti warrant jari kiya
 This has raised the possibility of Kumar's arrest by the CBI ahead of Thursday's hearing on the anticipatory bail plea in the High Court
 dilli ucch nyaayalay dwaara unhen raahat dene se inkaar karne ke baad buudhvaar ko adaalat main kumaar ke hajir nahin hone par sakht rukh apanaate hue atirikt mukhya metropolitan magistrate lokesh kumaar sharma ne kaha ki kumaar kii unke samaksh pesh hone kii jimmedaari thi
 The ACMM said, "the accused was asked to appear in court on Wednesday but he chose and corrected the way to challenge in the upper court but he could not get any relief
" adaalat ke aadesh kaa sammaan karnaa uskaa kartavya tha
 During the hearing of the case in court, CBI Special Prosecutor and Senior Advocate RS Cheema opposed the application of Kumar's counsel seeking exemption from personal appearance in court
 unhone kaha ki is tarah kii arji ko manjuur karnaa aaropee ko raahat dena hoga jise philhal ucch nyaayalay ne manjuuri nahin di he

 The scam in Madhya Pradesh's recruitment in government jobs and admission in government colleges is now becoming a headache for the state government
 vidhansabha main baari jeet ke baad teesri baar satta main ai shivaraj singh chouhan sarkaar ko vidhansabha ke pehle hi satr main vipaksh ne isi ghotaale par gheraa
 Leader of the Opposition Satyadev Katare lashed out at the government, accusing the government of protecting the culprits and that they would die only by completely exposing the scam
 vyavsaayik pariksha mandal (vyapam) ke is ghotaale main ghirti ja rahi bhartiya janata party (bijepi) sarkaar kaa saath uski apni party ke log bhi nahin de rahe hai
 Recently, senior BJP leader and former Chief Minister of the state Uma Bharti called this scam a bigger scam than Bihar's fodder scam
 haal hi main is ghotaale kii jaanch kar rahi special task force (estf) ne adaalat main 750 pannon kaa chaalaan pesh kiya he jisamen ghotaale main shaamil rahe vyapam ke adhikariyon or anya aropiyon kaa zikr he
 Apart from admission for Vyapam government colleges, the state government organization also conducts examinations for recruitment in some government departments
 vyapam ke adhikariyon par paisa lekar manamaane tareeke se pravesh dene ke aarope hameshaa hi lagate rahe the
 But this fraud was suddenly revealed in July last year
 darasal 7 july ko indore main yojit madhya pradesh pre-medical test (piemti) pariksha main kai aise munnabhai pakade gaye jo duusare chaatro kii jagah pariksha de rahe the
 The mastermind of the scam in questioning these students was Dr
 jagadish sagar kaa naam saamne aayaa tha
 After the arrest of Sagar, when the police questioned him, this big scam was found and information was found that not only in the admission in government colleges but also in recruitment of government departments, there has been a long running fraud
 tab se lagaataar khulaase ho rahe hai or vyapam ke adhikariyon ke saath-saath netaaon kaa bhi naam is ghotaale main judata gaya
 In this case, the STF had registered two firs on December 7 and 9 against 130 people, including Vyapam's former exam controller Pankaj Trivedi and Principal Systems Analyst Nitin Mahindra
 trivedi or mahindra ke bayaan ke aadhaar par purv ucch shiksha mantri lakshmikant sharma par bhi exiar darj kii gai thi
 Both of them had said in their statement that Lakshmikant Sharma had given them the roll numbers of some students
 un chaatro ko hi in logon ne pariksha main paas karavaaya tha
 After this, Sharma was also questioned recently
 poochtacha ke dauraan purv mantri ne in aaropon se inkaar kiya
 But the opposition has accused the government of protecting them
 usne kaha tha ki sharma ko giraftaar karne kii bajaae sirf poochtacha karke kyon chhod diya gaya?vyapam ghotaale ne us samay ek rahasyamay mode le liya jab ek shaks ghotaale se sambandhit dheron saboot hone kaa daawa karte hue saamne aayaa
 Tajwar Khan, who lives in Barkheda village, about 45 km from the capital Bhopal, came into the limelight on 15 January when Leader of Opposition Katare expressed apprehension in the assembly that Khan might be killed
 vajah ke rup main unhone bataaya ki khan ke paas vyapam ghotaale ke bahut-se thos saboot hai
 Katare had also gone to Khan's house and met his wife
 khan ne hi 2012 main rajyapal or lokayukta ko vyapam main chal rahe ghotaale kii shikaayat darj karwaai thi
 In the complaint, he said that the examination conducted by Vyapam for the recruitment of assistant teachers in class 2 and class 3 is a big fraud

 Khan says that he had obtained some evidence through RTI
 '' unhone lokayukta se bhi shikaayat karne kii baat kahi, ''maine sabooton ke saath lokayukta ko bhi is babat shikaayat darj karwaai he
 Khan had suddenly disappeared from his home in Barkheda recently
 is bich vyapam ghotaale kii jaanch kar rahi bhopal police unke ghar pahunch gai
 Khan, who returned four days later, alleged that in his absence, the police raped and beat up his wife and took away a large number of papers related to the scam from his house
 khan kehete hai, ''main kahin bhaaga nahin tha balki apane kisi nijee kaam se datia gaya hua tha
 At the same time, the police denied the allegations of mistreatment of Tajwar's wife

 Khan lives in a small house with his wife Reshma and son

 He describes himself as a journalist by profession and an editor of a magazine called Voice of Corruption
 khan or unki patni kaa daawa he ki unhone jab se vyapam kii parikshaon main dhaandhlee kii shikaayat darj karwaai he tab se unhen dhamkiyaan mil rahi hai

 After raising the issue on behalf of the Congress, he has admitted in the Assembly that out of 1,47,000 recruitments made in government departments since 2007, 1,000 appointments have been found to be fake
 philhal in logon ke khilaaf koi kadam nahin uthaaya gaya he
 Chauhan also said that the government will not spare any culprit

 An FIR has also been registered against them

 Many suspended students have approached the court, so no action is being taken against them at the moment

 But Chauhan is not ready for this

 It was only a few decades ago that when George Fernandes landed the cassock (the clergyman) and took up the practice of socialism, leaving the seminary, he was given a stamp of rebellion

 Even today there is no significant change in this eternal rebel

 Fernandes had an alleged brain surgery and due to that he is not fully healthy, but this elderly man does not appear to be in any way excited
 mujffarpur ke hotel main bade aaraam se baithe furnandis ne india today ko bataaya, ''main isaki parvaah nahin karata ki ve (nitish kumaar or sharad yadav) kya sochate hai

 "his voice was very dry and his words were expressionless, as if a person was merely reading figures
" lekin chhale jane kaa bhav kam dikhaane yaa bhavashoonyata se bhi kai uddashyon kii purti ho jaati he
 Perhaps they want to convey the message that opponents do not matter to them
 unki ankhon main yah shoonyata unke sankalpon main se ek ko jaahir kar detii he
 Now Fernandes is contesting the Lok Sabha elections from Majuffarpur in Bihar, this is the same seat from which he came to the 14th Lok Sabha
 nitish kumaar or sharad yadav ke yah tark dene ki ''kharaab swasthya'' ke chalate ve chunaav sambandhi mashkkat nahin sah paaenge or jiskaa bahaanaa banaakar unhen tikat dene se inkaar kar diya gaya tha, ab usee kaa jawaab dete hue furnandis janata dal (you) ke baagi ke taur par chunaav lard rahe hai
 Rebel Fernandes dismissed these arguments outright, saying, "I am old but well
" or samaajawaadee rajyasabha main nahin jate
 Due to the right reasons, he is the color of his red color-rebellion
 jayelo kii aage kii seat par baithkar road sho kar rahe hai
 The experienced and honest Fernandes has won many battles of his political career
 lekin aaj, 2009 main, loksabhaa main pehali baar chune jane ke 42 saal baad, jab shramikon kaa agua chunavi raajnneeti ke aakhri khel main utraa he, unhen parvat sareekhe morche ko fatah karnaa he
 Many of his supporters like his Manoj Kushwaha have deserted the top JD (U) leaders to avoid becoming a victim of wrath
 kai dostiyaan ab bhi kaayam hai to kuch dost bich safar main saath aa rahe hai
 It is understandable that most of the people of Muzaffarpur have a special love for this leader, who was first elected from here in 1977, when he was in captivity and went to fill his nomination wearing handcuffs
 karnataka ke isai parivaar ke furnandis jatigat bihar main ek asambhavya netaa hai
 Even today, he is among the few whose influence is beyond the strict caste boundaries of the state
 mujffarpur ke rajela gaanv ke 69 varshiya devanandan choudhary kehete hai, ''beshak jorge sahib yahaan shreshth ummidavaar hai
 If they were healthy, we would have voted for them
 '' haalanki yahaan aise bhi kai log hai jo aaj bhi furnandis kaa samarthan karne ko qamar kase hue hai
 He did not express the injury caused by JD (U) -the party he founded - changing Jai Narayan Nishad to Muzaffarpur as his candidate
 lekin nitish kumaar or unke vikaas ke bare main puche jane par unki ankhon main chamak daud jaati he
 "I will take him to any market in Bihar and show where the development has taken place," he says in an audacious voice
 meri ore se aap bhi puch sakate hai
 "fernandes, once the champion of socialist politics, which dominated Indian politics for decades, takes small steps to get to his vehicle today
" vaaki yah us shaks ke liye kisi vidambnaa se kam nahin jo kabhi ol india railwemens federation kaa adhyaksh tha or usne 1974 main ek atyadhik prabhavit karne vaali railway hadtaal kaa netritv kiya tha, jisamen 15 lakh karmchaariyon ne hissaa liya tha
 There are some among the voters of Muzaffarpur who consider 79-year-old Fernandes in two months to be a tarnished image of his powerful past
 mujffarpur ke orai ke udai kumaar kehete hai, ''un par apana vot kharaab karne kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 He should retire with comfort
 '' lekin aise bhi log hai jo maanate hai ki furnandis kaa apmaan parivaar ke kisi bade-bujurg ke apmaan kii tarah he
 Meanwhile, by making Fernandes a spindle, Nitish Kumar's opponents — Jagannath Mishra, Shambhu Sharan Srivastava, Upendra Kushwaha and P
K
 ke
 Sinha-ko gets a chance to surround them at home
 or furnandis kii baghawat nitish or sharad ke liye vaaki sirdard siddh ho rahi he
 Obviously, the battle of Fernandes goes far beyond symbolism
 or unki maujuudagi jatigat samikarnon ko bhi tod detii he, yah aisi khaas baat he jo unhen chunavi daud main kaaphi aage tak banaae rakhti he
 Despite not being physically fit, which may keep some of his supporters away from him on the day of judgment, Fernandes is still hard to ignore because his adversary Nishad has not been able to build trust
 ateet main nishad ne vaise hi partiyaan badali hai jaise ki college ke chaatr shanivaar kii raat ko ek party khatm kar duusari main chale jate hai
 It is no wonder that Nitish Kumar has had to come to Muzaffarpur thrice to campaign for his party's candidate
 vidambnaa yah he ki ek samay vah bhi tha jab furnandis ne lalu prasad yadav kaa varchasv todane ke liye nitish kumaar ko project kiya tha
 He is one of the founders of the Samata Party, which he and Nitish founded after the relationship with Lalu deteriorated
 baad main, nitish ne sharad se santhganth karte hue furnandis ko party ke adhyaksh pad se hataa diya tha
 Of course, Fernandes cannot cope with the turmoil of electoral politics
 unke vipakshi yah tark de rahe hai ki isse sansad main mujffarpur ko sirf pratikatmak pratinidhitiv hi mil paaegaa
 But was Yadav and Nitish's decision not to give tickets to Fernandes was correct? There are two points here, one of which is that Yadav had sent a letter to Fernandes proposing him to Rajya Sabha membership, that is, the JD (U) president was in fact probably clearing Fernandes's leaf
 sambhawatah yadav or nitish ko patr likhane ke bajaae furnandis se milakar yah baat kerani chahie thi ki ve chunaav ladane kii haalat main nahin hai
 Meanwhile, in Muzaffarpur, Fernandes seems completely beyond concern
 unhone haath jod rakhe hai, logon kii ore dekh rahe hai or jaise hi unka kafila aage badhata he unka cheharaa manorath se paripurna najar aata he
 As a hot air blows rapidly, a slight smile runs across his face
 ve mutthi banaate hai or kaanpate honton se kuch budbudate hai
 
 jayelo kii gati bad jaati he or kahin kshitij main jaakar kho jaati he
 Sincerely: India Today ek yuvak ko ek yuvati ko lagaataar ghoorna manhagaa pad gaya
 The woman lodged an FIR in the GRP at the railway station, after which the youth was arrested

 He said that the arrested Jai Singh was produced in the court of ACM Second Magistrate Harendra Bahadur Singh on Saturday evening where he ordered Jai Singh to be released on bail after hearing both the sides

 a Pakistani newspaper has said this
 akhbaar ne kaha he bam visphoton ke jariye ab tak 100 skool nasht kiye ja chuke hai
 News International stated in its editorial that despite the so-called victory against the Taliban, its activities have intensified more than ever
 akhbaar ne likhaa he, skool lagaataar bam se udaae ja rahe hai, puure kabyli ilaake main or khabar pakhtoonkhwaa main bachche shiksha se vanchit ho rahe hai
 With education that can save them from falling prey to poverty and extremism
