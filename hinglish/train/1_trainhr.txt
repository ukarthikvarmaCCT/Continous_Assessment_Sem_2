 The government's stand on the subject was emphasized by three of its senior ministers p Chidambaram, Kamal Nath and Manish Tiwari to the media, insisting that the demand for DMK was in the process of consideration
 unhone is baat par aashcharya vyakt kiya ki uske sahyogi (dramuk) ne samarthan waapas lene ke nirnay par phir se vichaar karne kaa vaayada karne ke baad apane rukh main parivartan kyon kiya
 Significantly, the DMK, the second largest constituent of the UPA government, has 18 members in the Lok Sabha
 sarkaar kii sthirataa ke bare main poochne par sansadeey kaarymantri kamalnath ne kaha ki hamaari sarkaar kamjor nahin he
 The government is not infirm but stable
 koi bhi raajnneetik dal hamaare bahumat ko chunauti dene aage nahin aayaa he
 Chidambaram said that India wants the 'stringent' resolution on Sri Lanka to be ratified at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva
 unhone kaha ki bharat is sambandh main masaude main sanshodhan pesh karegaa taaki tamilon ke maanavadhikaron ke kathith ulanghan par us desh ko thos sandesh pahunchaaya ja sake or use swatantra jaanch ke liye raji kiya ja sake
 The finance minister dismissed the allegations that India tried to dilute the us-worded proposal and said it was a rumor
 unhone kaha ki srilankai tamilon ke bare main sansad main prastaav paarit karne kii dramuk kii duusari maang par bhi anya dalon se vichaar vimarsh kii prakriya chal rahi he
 Chidambaram claimed that the DMK was aware of the government's stand on the issue but changed its stand between the night of 18 March and the morning of 19 March
 unhone kaha, ‘‘hamen is bare main nahin jaankaree he ki dramuk ne 18 march kii raat or 19 march kii subah ke bich apana rukh kyon badla
 Chidambaram said DMK supremo m Karunanidhi had said that the party would reconsider the decision to withdraw support provided the resolution in this regard is passed before 22 March
 teenon varisht mantriyon ne jor dekar kaha ki dramuk ke sarkaar se samarthan waapas lene ke baavjood sarkaar ko koi khatra nahin he
 Chidambaram said that simply because a colleague withdrew support did not weaken the government

 Asked about the stability of the government, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kamal Nath said that our government is not weak
 sarkaar ashakt nahin he balki sthir he
 No political party has come forward to challenge our majority
 chidambaram ne kaha ki bharat chahta he ki jineva sthit sanyukt raashtra maanavadhikaar parishad main srilanka par ‘kade’ prastaav kaa anumodan kiya jaae
 He said that India would introduce an amendment to the draft in this regard so that a concrete message could be sent to that country on the alleged violations of human rights of the Tamils and it could be persuaded for independent investigation

 chidambaram ne kaha ki keval isliye ki ek sahyogi ne samarthan waapas le liya he, isse sarkaar kamjor nahin hui he

 Nitish Kumar also told Sharad Yadav that he also talked to Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul Gandhi to interfere in the matter, no solution was found
 nitish ne jaankaree di ki jab sonia or rahul ne bhi lalu yadav ke saamne sarender kar diya, tab unhen bijepi ke saath jane kaa vikalp chunanaa padaa

 dilli main un daal vyapriyon par kejariwal sarkaar ne nakel kasnaa shuru kar diya he, jo gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se apane godaam main daal stock kar rahe hai
 On Thursday, the Food Department seized thousands of quintals of lentils by putting red in the warehouses of several lentil traders in different areas of Delhi
 khaadya vibhaag ne daal kii jamkhori karne vaale vyapaariyon par najar rakhane ke liye 11 special team taiyaar kii hai
 SDM has been appointed as the leader for each team
 is muhim main khaadya vibhaag ke adhikariyon ke alaava vibhaag se jude inspector ko chhapemari kii jimmedaari di gai he
 The special team of the raid department raided the godowns of traders and raided the godowns of Alipur, Bawana, Sirsapur, Lawrence Road, Narela and Naya Bazar in Delhi on Thursday
 ek taraf vyapaaree is chhapemari se anjaan the to duusari taraf special team ne dinabhar main 26 daal godaamon kii jaanch kar daali
 Meanwhile around 6776 from the warehouse on Alipore and Lawrence Road
 60 quintal daal jabt kii gai
 Let us tell you that the Delhi government has set a stock limit of 2 thousand quintals for pulses for traders
 tay seemaa se zyada daal kaa bhandaran karnaa shila sarkaar ke vakt se hi gaiyrkanoonee he
 The demand of increasing the stock traders believes that as the population of Delhi has increased in the last few years, the consumption of pulses has also increased
 daal vyapaaree lambey vakt se daal kii stock seemaa ko 2 hajaar quintal se badhaakar, 5000 quintal karne kii maang dilli sarkaar se kar rahe hai
 Delhi is a state where pulses are not produced at all
 desh kii rajdhani main maharashtra, madhyapradesh, karnataka, uttar pradesh, rajasthan, andhrapradesh jaise rajyon se daal kii alag- alag kism ko aayaat kiya jaataa he
 However, there are many states in the country where there is no stock limit on pulses
 jabaki kuch rajya aise bhi hai jahaan sabase zyada istemaal kii jane vaali daalon par stock seemaa lagu he
 3 demands placed in front of Kejriwal During a public meeting in the past, pulses traders had placed 3 main demands in front of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal - 1
 vyapaariyon ke yahaan chhapemari par roak lage
 2
 bhandaran ke pukhta intjaam kiye jaaen
 Warehouses in the city and rural areas should be regularized
 3
 The stock limit of pulses should be increased from 2000 quintals to 5000 quintals
 sarkaar ko daam badhane kii chintadrasal sarkaar isliye bhi uljhan main he ki stock seemaa badhaane se kahin daal ke daamon main teji naa aa jaae
 It is obvious that in such a situation, the cost of rising pulses will flow on the government
 shaayad yahi ek badi vajah he ki kejariwal sarkaar stock seemaa badhaane ko lekar koi faisla nahin kar pai he
 However, the government is still worried about the rise in the prices of pulses, so the special team of the Food Department will continue the raid in the pulse godowns

 In the court, Kapil accused the BAMC action of being unlawful and motivated by wrong motives
 kapil ne adaalat ko bataaya tha ki wo maamla pehle se satr nyaayalay main chal rahaa he or satr nyaayalay ne aakhri faisla aane tak biemasi kii karrwai par roak lagaaya hua he boujood iske biemasi saal 2016 main phir se notice bhej rahi he or epa ai aar bhi darj karvaa diya he

 lekin phir, achaanak se november, 2014 ko biemasi ke building or factory department ne notice dekar building ke kuch hisse ko avaidh bataaya
 The matter is already pending in the Sessions Court
 tippaniyan Darsial Kapil Sharma had tweeted and accused a BMC officer of demanding Rs 5 lakh and directly questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi's good day

 It turned out that Kapil's office is illegal
 uski vajah se mangrove kaa bhi nuksaan hua he
 After the Forest Department became active in the case, BMC also became active and again took notice of the action at Kapil's flat in Goregaon with that bungalow
 lekin ab chunki biemasi ne adaalat se khud hi kaha he ki wo saal 2016 kii apni notice waapas le rahi he to adaalat ne kapil ke khilaaf darj exiaar par roak laga di he or biemasi ko kaha he ki wo maamle main kapil kaa paksh sune

 Mangroves have also suffered due to that
 maamle main van vibhaag ke sakriy hone ke baad biemasi bhi sakriy ho gai or us bangale ke saath goregaanv main kapil ke flats par phir se karrwai kaa notice pakadaa diya
 But now since BMC has told the court itself that it is withdrawing its notice of 2016, the court has stayed the FIR lodged against Kapil and asked BMC to hear Kapil's side in the case
 vartmaan main kamedi sho main sahyogi abhinayta sunil grover or anya ke saath badasluki ke liye vivaadon main ghire kapil sharma ke liye ye khabar raahat banakar ai he

 Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj's help to her friend and tainted former Indian Premier League commissioner Lalit Modi was sparked by headlines when she picked up the phone and spoke to her trusted partner and friend in the Cabinet Committee on Security Affairs, Home Minister Rajnath Singh
 rajnath ne vaada kiya ki vah “maanviya aadhaar par” lalit modi ke bachaav kii baat pradhanmantri narendra modi tak pahunchaa denge, jo 2010 main desh chhodkar bhaag gaye the
 The Enforcement Directorate (ED) wanted to question him about his role in the Rs 425 crore scam
 pradhanmantri ke saath mulaakaat pehle hi tay ho chuki thi, isliye mauka tadkar rajnath ne piem se jor dekar yah baat kahi ki sarkaar ko “apano main se ek” kaa samarthan jarur karnaa chahie
 This meant that regular spokespersons would not be able to respond to the increasingly sharp criticisms on TV
 isamen badi topon ko lagaana hoga
 Modi called BJP president Amit Shah and said that his former political rival should be publicly defended
 bijepi ke bheetar sab jaanate hai ki modi or swaraj ke bich koi khaas madhurata nahin he, yah bhi ki donon ke bich virodh kaa yah rishta chunaav kii purv vela main tab or pukhta ho gaya, jab pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke liye narendra modi ke chayan par swaraj ne khuleam asahmati jaahir kii thi
 After losing the battle, Swaraj remained completely away from the glare last year and worked relentlessly to increase diplomatic relations with the world by staying behind the scenes, even when the Prime Minister raised flags with pomp in all 18 countries of her travels
 
 lekin pichley hafte sushamaa achaanak ek tufaan main ghir gayi, jo landan ke akhbaar da sande times kii ek report se shuru hua
 The report accused him of using his influence with Indian-origin British MP Keith Vaz and other British officials to get Lalit Modi the travel papers in July 2014
 report main kai email kaa hawala diya gaya, jinase vaaj, lalit modi or swaraj ke bich khaasi najdiki or santhganth kii jhalak milti thi
 There were other characters in the story, such as Sushma's husband Swaraj Kaushal, who asked Lalit Modi to enroll his nephew at Sussex College and he in turn told Vaj
 pataa yah chalaa ki kaushal, jo vakil hai, 22 saal se lalit modi ke salaahkaar rahe hai or unki beti bansuri unka bachaav karne vaali kanoonee team kaa hissaa hai
 Sushma Swaraj definitely wanted to show favor to her family friend
 lekin is baat kaa faisla abhi hona he ki unhone us shaks ke haq main jaan-boojhkar niyamon ko todaa-maroda, jo kai logon kii nigaah main aarthik apradhi he, yaa ve ek jaruratmand aadmi kii madad karnaa chaahati thim
 a source close to Swaraj says, "she believed she was helping a friend, whose wife was ill
" unhone british sarkaar se yah kabhi nahin kaha ki unhen waapas bharat na bheja jaae
 Not only this, his decision was proved true on July 27, 2014, when the Delhi High Court rejected the travel restrictions imposed on Lalit Modi and ordered that his passport be returned, which was seized by the Indian government in 2011
 Was
 ”hakeekat yah he ki videsh mantralay ke passport anubhag ne is maamle main supreme court main apil nahin kii
 However, it could be argued in the defense of the Ministry of External Affairs that the ED should have given such advice
 jaahir he, donon mantralayon ne ek duusare se koi baat nahin kii
 So, is Sushma Swaraj guilty of just a procedural misconduct or is it more serious? Why did the UPA government not take steps on ed's allegations against Lalit Modi for four consecutive years before losing power in May 2014? Not only this, why did Finance Minister Arun Jaitley not emphasize the matter after taking over the ministry last year, especially when the fight against black money is at the top of the Narendra Modi government's agenda? There are many more important questions
 misaal ke liye, july 2014 main swaraj ne kya pradhanmantri ko bataaya tha ki ve landan se lalit modi ke haq main ek meharbaani karne ke liye kehane ja rahi hai, khaskar tab jab ve jaanati thim ki purv ipiel kamishnar gujarat cricket association ke pramukh ke taur par narendra modi ko jaanate the? ve or vasundhara raaje bijepi kii bhavi yojanaon main yaa kam se kam narendra modi ke satta ke daayre main kahaan khadi hai, kyonki lalit modi ne daawa kiya he ki rajasthan kii mukhyamantri ne britain main unke residency states kaa samarthan karne vaale dastavejon par dastakhat kiye the?isamen koi shaq nahin ki desh kaa pasandida rajnatik shah-maat kaa khel in dinon puure josho-kharosh ke saath khelaa ja rahaa he
 There are stories in Jaipur about how the former IPL chief became a "non-constitutional authority" during Raje's first Chief Ministership from 2003-2008
 charchaa yah bhi he ki modi ne us vakt raaje ke bete dushyant singh ko gaiyr-jamaanti karj diya tha
 But as the 2013 elections were taking place, Modi woke up and even tweeted that Arun Jaitley, Raje and Bhupendra Yadav (who was Jaitley's assistant and then chief messenger between Gujarat CM Narendra Modi and the RSS) in the Assembly
 Were involved in selling tickets
 bijepi ke kai andruni netaa maanate hai ki lalit modi vivaad ne sarkaar ko acha-khaasaa nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 If Raje's signatures are truly found on Lalit Modi's documents, the party may have to pay a heavy price; In such a situation, to save Raje would mean to be completely defeated before today's Prime Minister
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki indresh kumaar ke swaraj ko kamobesh doshamukt karne vaale bayaan ke baavjood aresas is baat se khush nahin he ki bijepi ke bheetar kii puraani daraaren ujagar kii ja rahi hai
 The distance between political rival Swaraj and Jaitley once again came to the fore
 videsh mantri ne vivaad se nibatane ke tareeke ke bare main salaah lene ke liye vitt mantri se baat tak karne se inkaar kar diya, baavjood iske ki idi vitt mantralay ke tahat hi aata he
 Initially, seeing bjp's insiders taking recourse to Rajnath Singh to clarify his position in front of the Prime Minister, the BJP insiders wonder whether Swaraj's estrangement with Narendra Modi has now been confirmed
 jetali, jinhen maujuuda sankat se sabase zyada phayda hota dikhaai de rahaa he, jaanate hai ki vivaad jaise-jaise teevr hota ja rahaa he, unhen apana sir jhukaakar rakhana hoga
 But there are many people who believe that it is Rajnath Singh, who is on the way to emerge as the second most influential person in the country after Narendra Modi by pushing Arun Jaitley due to this whole controversy
 16 june kii press conference main jetali jab swaraj ke saath apni kathith pratidwandvita sahit tamaam sawaalon kaa saamana kar rahe the, tab uttar pradesh ke vinamr or shant thakur netaa mand-mand muskaraate dekh gaye the
 Interestingly, Swaraj himself also violated the protocol of his own ministry, which no one else has confirmed, Sujatha Singh, Foreign Secretary, in July 2014
 sujatha singh ne india today se kaha, “unhone modi ke liye yatra dastavejon ke bare main mujhase kabhi baat nahin kii
 "but it seems, in the public court, Swaraj is also being blamed for the fact that she helped a man who lives a life of shame in a shameless way
 lalit modi amiron ke saath uthne-baithne or khubasurat logon ke saath party karte najar aate hai or yah tab bhi puri tarah jaahir tha, jab unhen landan se baahar jane kii ijaajat tak nahin thi
 That is why, on 1 August 2014, he thanked NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Zee chairman Subhash Chandra and international celebrity Naomi Campbell for supporting them, among others, as soon as Swaraj returned his British travel papers
 philhal pradhanmantri modi or aresas videsh mantri ke peeche ekajute khadey dikhaai dete hai; donon sahamat hai ki unhen is vakt to hataaya nahin ja saktaa, kyonki ise galati kabool karne or kamajori ke taur par dekha jayega
 But it is equally true that all this havoc has hurt Swaraj's hard work and carefully built reputation as well as her political ambitions
 aresas ke najdiki ek bijepi netaa ne kaha, “agar sushamaa ji jaati hai, to parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ke purti samooh main kathith benami lenden vipaksh ke nishane par aa sakate hai
 This government was expected to be somewhat different
 ”lekin sachaai yahi he ki upie or ab bijepi bhi lalit modi ko prabhaavaheen karne yaa bharat waapas laane main naakaam rahi he
 The person who once changed the rules of the game in India can change the fate of people and even governments while in exile
 bijepi ke andruni sutara thodi ghabrahat ke saath hairaani jaahir kar rahe hai ki kya acchhee, yaa buree, khabar tikdi main aegi? or sushamaa swaraj or vasundhara raaje ke baad dhul-dhoosarit hone waalon main agali baari kiski hogi? The first BJP government in Haryana has completed its 100 days
 aaj mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ne apni uplabdhiyaan ginane ke liye press conference kii
 He told the media that a roadmap has been prepared for the development of the state and many new initiatives have been taken
 unhone bataaya kii janata kii shikayaton ko dur karne ke liye siem windo kii shuruyaat kii he or skim ko acchhee shuruyaat mili he
 Taking lessons from the previous government's recruitment scams, the BJP government has implemented a system of giving more marks to the written examination in police recruitment and minimum marks to the interview
 mukhyamantri ne rajya ko sports hub banane ke liye nai khel niti or antarrashtriya str par padak jeetne vaale khilaadiyon kii inaam raashi badhane kaa bhi zikr kiya
 Angry over the retirement age of employees from 60 to 58, the state government has recently approved the decision to implement SC quota in promotions
 mukhyamantri ne ise apni badi uplabdhi bataaya, lekin sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par nazar daalen to kai charchit muddon par uski kirakiri bhi hui
 It started with action at Rampal Ashram in Hisar
 mediakarmiyon kii police pitayee ne sarkaar ko pareshaan rakhaa
 There were allegations that the government was late in understanding the seriousness of the case
 sarkaar par pradesh kaa bhagavakaran karne ke aarope bhi lage
 The education minister had announced a new education policy led by Dinanath Batra, associated with the RSS ideology, although the matter is still on hold
 khud mukhyamantri ne bhi skulon main gita padhaane kii vyavastha nae satr se lagu karne kii baat kahi he
 The government has announced to make Yoga Guru Ramdev the brand ambassador of the state and to include yoga in the curriculum
 uria ko lekar bhi sarkaar ko pareshaani jhelni padi
 In many districts, the farmers had to eat sticks and sit on dharna
 baad main sarkaar ko police thanon main kisaanon kii parchi katwani padi
 In its election manifesto, BJP had promised unemployment allowance, yet the Khattar government is silent on it
 skool-college jane vaali ladakiyon ke liye security guard vaali basen chalaane kaa vaada bhi paravaan nahin chadh sakaa he, haalanki sutluj-yamuna link nahar main pani laane ke liye sarkaar ne supreme court kaa daravaaza jarur khatkhataya he
 Due to the policy of keeping distance from the media, his cabinet colleagues more than Chief Minister Khattar, but political rivals Ram Bilas Sharma, Anil Vij and Captain Abhimanyu were more in the news, although close to the Chief Minister, they are now trying to reduce the distance
 
 baharhaal, sarkaar kii abhi tak kii sabase badi uplabdhi to yahi rahi he kii pichley 100 dinon main us par bhrashtachar kaa koi aarope nahin laga he
 IMA President Drs

 India still lacks a system that can identify congenital hearing problems in infants
 bhartiya team ke nideshak ravi shastri ne kaha he ki kaaryvahak captain viraat kohli main unhen khud kii thodi jhalak dikhti he
 Shastri said during an interaction with the management students in Kolkata, he is aggressive and very young, so still a lot of enthusiasm can be seen in him, which is good for the team
 main usamen thodi apni jhalak bhi dekhtaa hum
 He said, Even when i was 20-22 years old, i used to be full of enthusiasm
 ham acchhee cricket khel rahe hai

 Last time he tweeted
 jisamen unhone pati-patni par bane ek joke ko share kiya tha
 In which he told a dish
 jiskaa naam- 'delicious rosted hasband tha
 ' dilli police kii krime branch ne neshnal aronutics spes administration yani nasa ke naam par ek dhaatu bechney ke bahaane thagi karne ke aarope main ek pita-putr ko giraftaar kiya he
 The two met the victim exactly like the scientist of NASA and he was also wearing an Astronaut shoot at the time
 tippaniyan The police have arrested both
 estronaut shoot pahanane vaale yah log na to nasa se jude hai or na hi koi vaigyanik hai, lekin isi shoot ko pahanakar in logon ne dilli ke ek garment exporter ko rice pular naam kaa ek metal bechney kaa jhansa diya
 The businessman told that RP Metal pulls rice on its own and this metal will be sold for Rs 37500 crore in NASA
 police ke mutabik in donon ne kaarobaari se arapy metal kii jaanch ke naam par ek karod 43 lakh rupee kharch karwaae
 The businessman was told that the money taken from the Astronaut shoot and investigation was very expensive from that money
 jabaki ke shoot mahaz1200rupee main chandani chowk se liye gaye the
 He also told that a scientist was called from DRDO for investigation, whose fees are very high
 kaarobaari ko ek farzi lab bhi dikhaai gai, lekin baad main ye kaha gaya ki aasmaan saaf nahin hone kii vajah se radioective arapy pular kii jaanch nahin ho saki or jab tak jaanch main ye sahi nahin payajata jab tak nasa main ise nahin bechaa ja saktaa
 In fact, the accused father is 56-year-old Virender Mohan and his 30-year-old son Nitin
 donon dilli ke pashchim vihaar ke rahane vaale hai or1990se ek motor workshop chalaa rahe the
 In order to earn more money, he adopted this unique method of cheating by claiming that he owns a metal company of America
 ab police inke saathi nakli vaigyanik kii bhi talash kar rahi he
 According to Bhishma Singh, DCP of Crime Branch, there is neither a metal named RP Puller nor it is used in NASA
 police ne donon kii giraftaar kar liya he
 These astronaut shooters are neither associated with NASA nor any scientists, but by wearing this shoot, they lured a Delhi garment exporter to sell a metal called Rice Puller
 kaarobaari ko bataaya ki arapy metal chaaval ko apneaap apni taraf khinchataa he or ye metal nasa main37500karod kaa bik jayega
 According to the police, both of them spent Rs one crore 43 lakh in the name of investigating the RP metal from the businessman
 kaarobaari ko bataaya gaya ki us paise se estronaut shoot or jaanch se judaa saamaan liya gaya he jo bahut mahangaa he
 While the shoots were taken from Chandni Chowk for just Rs
 1200
 inhoneye bhi bataaya ki jaanch ke liye diardio se ek vaigyanik bulaayaa gaya jisaki fees bahut zyada he
 a fake lab was also shown to the businessman, but later it was said that due to not clear sky, the radioactive RP puller could not be tested and it could not be sold in NASA until the investigation found it to be correct
 
 asal main aaropee pita 56 saal kaa virendra mohan or 30 saal kaa uskaa betaa nitin he
 Both hail from Paschim Vihar in Delhi and were running a motor workshop since 1990
 unhone zyada paise kamaane ke chakkar main khud ko america kii ek metal company kaa maalik bataakarathgi kaa ye nayab tarika apana liya
 Now the police is also looking for his fellow fake scientist
 krime branch ke disipi bhishma singh ke mutabik na to arapy pular naam kaa koi metal hota he or na nasa main iskaa prayog hota he
 In fact, the accused father is 56-year-old Virender Mohan and his 30-year-old son Nitin
 donon dilli ke pashchim vihaar ke rahane vaale hai or1990se ek motor workshop chalaa rahe the

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne shivasena ke khilaaf ek bhi shabd nahin bolne kaa elaan kiya he
 At the Sangli rally, Modi said that this is his tribute to Bal Thackeray
 iske saath hi unhone ensipi supremeo sharad pavaar par karaara prahaar karte hue kaha ki unke charitra main shivaji ke gun nahin hai
 Narendra Modi said that the state of Maharashtra has completely worsened the condition of the state
 ghotaalon ko zikr karte hue unhone kaha ki maharashtra main to vidhwaaon ke flats tak lut liye gaye
 In response to the criticisms being made by Sharad Pawar, Narendra Modi said, 'he probably does not even know history
 gujarat pehle maharashtra kaa hi bhaag rahaa he
 Gujarat still considers Maharashtra as its elder brother
 'ummid ke mutabik hi narendra modi ne haal hi main gathbandhan se alag hui shivasena ke khilaaf ek bhi shabd nahin kaha
 He clearly said that he will not speak against Shiv Sena
 itnaa hi nahin, unhone divangat bal thakare ke prati apana sammaan jaahir kiya
 Modi said, i respect Balasaheb's resolve
 unki gairmaujuudagi main maharashtra main yah pehla chunaav he
 Referring to his special attachment with Maharashtra, the Prime Minister said that he has come to pay the debt of this earth
 unhone kaha, 'ab tak bijepi kabhi bhi sangli se loksabhaa chunaav nahin jeet saki thi, par is baar hamane sangli se jitna maanga, usase zyada mila
 Centenary greetings of Sangli voters greg chapel kii aalochana main sachin tendulkar kaa puraa samarthan karte hue purv bhartiya cricketer vivies lakshmana ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki australia ke is purv khilaadi ke rashtriya team ke coach ke do saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan dressing room kaa maahaul 'badtar' tha
 Reacting to the revelations made by Sachin Tendulkar in his soon-to-be-released autobiography 'playing it My Way', Laxman said he had full faith in what the great batsman had written in his book
 lakshmana ne kaha, ‘‘mujhe lagata he ki 2006 bhartiya cricket ke liye kaaphi mushkil daur tha
 The dressing room atmosphere was possibly the worst
 mujhe yaad he ki 2006 main jab mujhe dakshin africa main antim vanade or phir test shrunkhlaa ke liye team main shaamil kiya gaya
 i remember when i went to South Africa it was probably the most negative dressing room i was part of
 dressing room main kaaphi tanaav tha or yah gairajaruri tha
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘senior or junior khilaadiyon ke bich khai paidaa kii ja rahi thi
 i always believed that the cricket team is like family
 jab aap desh kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahe ho, jab aap maidan par ho to aap ek vyakti ke rup main kaam nahin kar sakate
 You have to work as a team, a unit
 ’’ Laxman said, "it doesn't matter whether you are senior or junior
 aap hameshaa ek duusare kii madad karte ho or ek duusare kii tarif karte ho
 He said, "before Greg Chappell, John Wright and after Greg Chappell, Gary Kirsten is credited with improving the team atmosphere in which we were always able to play with an open mind and we always did well
" yah durbhaagyashaalee he ki aisa maahaul taiyaar kiya gaya jo gairajaruri tha
 '' tendulkar ne zikr kiya he ki chapel ne lakshmana ko dhamkee di thi ki agar usne bharat main test match main pari kii shuruyaat karne se inkaar kiya to uskaa kariyar samaapt ho jayega
 Laxman said in this context that Tendulkar has the right to hold his view freely
 unhone kaha, ‘‘vah bhartiya cricket kaa stambh rahe or asal main khel ke mahaan doot hai
 When he is writing a book, his autobiography in which he is going to talk about his whole life, his journey as Indian cricket, the various situations he faced, i think it is appropriate for him to Say everything openly bina eemaandaaree ke kitaab likhane kaa koi matlab nahin he
 '' desh kii badhati aabaadi chintaa kaa vishay he
 According to United Nations estimates, by 2024, China and India will have the same population
 iske baad bharat aabaadi ke maamle main china ko bhi peeche chhod degaa
 While the central government and state governments run various programs for population control, Goa Governor Mridula Sinha has something else to say about this
 unhone logon ke chota parivaar rakhane par chintaa jataai he
 At the same time, he has also advocated changing the slogan of population control to 'we do, our two or three'
 bihar ke hajipur main ek kaarykram main mridula sinha ne kaha, “parivaar bahut chota hota ja rahaa he
 My concern is, where i go, i get to hear that 'we do, our one', this slogan is heard
 maine kaha ye naaraa ‘ham do, hamaare do yaa teen’ hona chahie, ye sankalp lo
 This statement of the Governor of Goa is astonishing
 wo bhi aise vakt main jab desh kii badi aabaadi or simit sansadhano kii vajah se badi sankhya main logon ko dikkaton kaa saamana he
 According to the United Nations estimate, by 2024, India and China will have a population of around 1 billion 44 crore
 in donon deshon main hi duniya kii kul aabaadi main se 37 fisadi log rahete hai
 If the current birth rate and death rate continue, then India's population will reach one and a half billion by 2030 and one billion 66 million by 2050
 vahiin 2030 ke baad china kii aabaadi ghatana shuru ho jaaegi
 Like all cities, in the country's capital, Delhi, people were worried to withdraw and deposit money

 To overcome the situation, the police first released tear gas shells on the crowd and even if the situation was not under control, they also fired in the air
 goli lagane se ek sthaneey yuvak kii maut bhi ho gai
 People say that if the police had controlled the crowd in a manner, the situation would have been under control and a man would not have to lose his life
 logon kaa kahana he ki agar police dhang se bheed ko control karti to halaat kaabo main bhi rahete or ek aadmi ko apni jaan se haath na dhonaa padataa

 google india ne desh main Neighbourly naamak ek ap shuru kiya he
 Currently its beta version has been released
 is ap par log apane aasapaas kii jaankaree hasil kar paaenge
 Google India said via tweet, 'beta version is available in Mumbai today

 Josh Woodward, group product manager of Google's Next Billion user team, said in a statement, "together with Neighborly, we are looking at a new way to advance Google's mission to mobilize information around the world
 taaki suchanaaen aasaani se uplabdh hon or unka upyog kiya ja sake
 It was said by Google that people will get information about their area easily with the app

 (input-ians) ek taraf das janpath main sonia or rahul gandhi vipakshi dalon ko dinar de rahe the, or bad-chadhakar elaan kiya ki modi ko rokane ke liye rajyon main aapasi matbhed bhulaakar rashtriya str par ekajute hona hoga
 But on the other hand, in the by-elections of Phulpur and Gorakhpur in UP, the SP-BSP alliance defeated the BJP, Congress fought in both the seats and could not even save the bail
 aise main vipakshi ekta ko lekar congress baikfoot par aa gai
 Subsequently, considering the opinion of his strategists and Siddaramaiah, Rahul decided to fight alone instead of going with JDS in Karnataka
 isi bich rahul ne kah diya ki 2019 main congress ke sabase badi party banane kii surat main vah piem ban sakate hai
 There was a lot of controversy on this as well
 congress adhyaksh kii ranneetiis dauraan congress kii vipaksh ko jodne kii muhim jhatka khaati dikh rahi thi
 According to sources, in such a situation, Rahul discussed the new strategy to stop the BJP even before the results of the Karnataka elections, the organization general secretary Ashok Gehlot and senior Netagulam Nabi Azadse
 rahul ne saafe kar diya ki agar bahumat mili yaa 2-4 vidhayak kam rahe to siddharmaiya mukhyamantri banenge, lekin bahumat ke aankade se dur rahane par congress sabase badi party banati he to jedies ke saath milakar sarkaar banaai jaae
 According to sources, a contrary possibility also emerged in the discussion that if BJP became the largest party and lagged behind by a majority, then JDS should be given the cm's chair to stop it
 magar congress ke ranneetikaron ko is sthiti kii zaraa bhi ummid nahin thi
 That is why the party was silent on the last situation, while taking the JDS with it, the inside was agreed
 sonia gandhi kaa saharakarnataka chunaav main congress kii ummiido ke ulat nattejey aane par rahul ke nirdeshaanusaar foran azaad or gahalot ne jedies camp ko mukhyamantri kii kursi dene ke liye hami bhar di
 Here, in Delhi, Rahul, as a precautionary measure to strengthen his decision, conducted a conversation with Sonia Gandhi with Deve Gowda, for which Ahmed Patel played an active role
 vipakshi dalon ko sandeshdarasal, iske jariye rahul baaki vipakshi dalon ko ye sandesh dena chaahate the ki bijepi ko rokane ke liye badi party hone par bhi vah rajya main bacseet lene ko taiyaar hai
 Now Team Rahul feels that if Kumaraswamy became CM, it would not be good if in future he got a better partner of alliance to defeat BJP in Karnataka
 saath hi bijepi agar kumaraswami ko siem nahin banane detii to baaqi kshetreey dal bijepi ke khilaaf mukhar honge
 Bala Kaun Banega Rahul's strategy for Vikalparahul is straightforward
 pichley anubhavon ko bhoolatey hue vipakshi modi ke khilaaf congress ke saath aaen
 The Congress will take care of everyone instead of making a nose question
 darasal, team rahul ko lagata he ki rajyon menkshetreey dalonko saath lekar modi se muqabla kiya jaae
 Anyway, if there is success, then in every case the Congress will be the biggest party and if the biggest party becomes the PM, then who can be better than Rahul
 saath hi karnataka ke jariye baaqi vipakshi dalon ko rahul kaa ye bhi sandesh he ki bijepi ko rokane ke liye jarurat padi to congress 1996 kii tarah bacseet par bhi aa sakati he
 Talking to 'aaj Tak' on this issue, senior Congress leader RPN Singh said that right decision has to be taken at the right time in politics and Rahul is doing the same
 pehle bhi rahul or sonia kah chuke hai ki rajyon main dalon ko aapasi matbhedon ke baavjood centre main modi sarkaar kii taanaashaahee se nipatane or loktantr kii raksha ke liye rashtriya str par ekajute hona hoga
 Three people have been injured in Israeli bombing at Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip, one of them being reported to be in critical condition
 philistini suraksha evam chikitsa seva ne yahudee raashtra main rocket hamale ke kai ghante baad yah jaankaree di thi
 Security sources said Israeli airplanes struck two Hamas military bases in the northern Gaza Strip last night, causing considerable damage to them
 gaja city main shipha aspataal ke chikitsa adhikari ne bataaya ki hamale main ghayal teen logon kaa ilaaj kiya ja rahaa he
 The condition of a 26-year-old is also critical

 The Israeli army has confirmed the attack and says they have carried out the attack a few hours earlier in exchange for a rocket attack from Gaza
 sena ke pravaktaa ne bataaya ki us durghatana main koi nuksaan athwa kshati nahin hui he
 It is clear that there have been a total of three wars between Israel and the Islamic extremist Hamas with the conflict since 2008
 israel ko yakeen he ki gaja pattee par uski jamini karrwai se maujuuda sankat kaa hal khojane main madad milegi
 The question is how the fire that has been burning for the last 66 years or even more than that can be calmed by war
 israel-philistin sangharsh kaa khooni itihaas yahi kahata he ki jang masalon kaa hal nahin he
 The Gaza Strip has been burning in a rusty fire since 8 July
 jab se israel ne hamaas main rocket hamalon ke jawaab main hawaii hamale shuru kiye he
 But the reality is that this area has been burning for the last 66 years, that is, since the demand for a separate country for Jews was rising in the atmosphere created after World War II

 maamle main ek anya aaropee haryana ke purv mantri gopal kanda abhi bhi faraar hai

 Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate DK Jangala, extending the custody of Aruna, directed the investigating agency to complete the investigation by keeping him in custody within the stipulated time
 police ne yah bhi bataaya ki janvari 2011 main jab geetika ne emdlaar samooh main ek nideshak ke taur par kaam shuru kiya tha tab use har shaam company ke prabandh nideshak (kanda) ko report karne ko kaha gaya tha
 He said that Geetika was appointed as the director of the company but did not have any stake in the company and one of the conditions in her terms of service was to report to the managing director of the company every evening
 police ne kaha ki aruna ke jariye hi company ke ricard praapt kiye ja sakate hai kyonki kanda faraar hai
 Geetika (23), a former flight attendant of MDLR, alleged in a note written before her suicide that she was committing suicide due to the harassment of Kanda and Aruna

 prabhaash joshi jitne bade sampadak the, utane hi bade cricket premi bhi
 However, the book 'khel is not just game' compiles articles written by Prabhash Joshi on sports
 in lekhon main unhone lagbhag sabhi khelon ke bare main likhaa, par cricket or tennis par unke likhe se hindi main khel vishleshan kaa puraa paridrishy hi badal gaya tha
 Prabhash Joshi wrote in his role: This book contains articles that i wrote on sports
 ab jis tarah raajnneeti par sampadakeey pej par sampadakeey yaa mukhya lekh yaa jab jaruri hua, pehle pej par likhata rahaa
 In the same way games continued to be played - covering the first page, the last page and the editorial page
 aisa karte hue jo batch jaataa tha yaa jiske maanviya pahalu ke liye khabar main gunjaaish nahin hoti thi, vahi kaagad kaare main aayaa
 i do not consider sports as a recreational or physical exercise
 khel manushya kaa charitra banaata he, lekin usase bhi zyada khel main manushya kaa charitra vyakt or prakat hota he
 The English mother's Canadian son, Greg Rusewski, won one set in a match against American Michael Chang, lost one and was on four games in the third set
 ruzeski sarv kar rahaa tha tees-tees par
 Two more points were needed to win the game
 kisi tarah vah dus par aayaa or phir adwantage par
 The game was to take place after a point
 sarv karne ke pehle ruzeski ne apane par cross banaaya or gend chumi
 That's when i thought the game would lose it
 ruzeski ne sarvice kii or net main maar di or phir maar ke daban folt kar diya
 Chang had a chance and took both the game and the set
 tab ruzeski kii sarvice gole jaise hoti thi or uskaa karier ban rahaa tha
 i wrote that he would never win a grand slam
 jeeta bhi nahin or ab to kheltaa bhi nahin
 At the most delicate and decisive moment of that match, Rusewski did not believe in himself so he made a cross and kissed the ball
 sabase kathin ghadi main jiskaa apane par vishwaas nahin hota, usase kuch bhi jeeta nahin jayega
 i see sports like cricket, tennis, football to understand the character of players and teams in these delicate and difficult times
 mahaj man bahalane ke liye nahin
 Game is really a discipline that makes and manifests human beings
 aaj bharat vishwacap ke semi final main newjiland se bhid rahaa he, aise main prabhaash joshi kii yaad aana swaabhaavik he
 Read the literature on Aaj Tak, in his book 'khel is not just a game', written excerpts on cricket: The game is not just a game, i would say that the power was lost
 lekin aapse kya chup saktaa he? sachai yahi he ki bijli jane ke minute-bhar pehle tivi band karke baithak se uthakar bathroom main aa gaya tha
 The program was to begin after two and a half hours to get ready for a bath to go
 taiyaar hone kaa aadha ghanta or raste kaa aadha ghanta donon milakar bhi kuch ek ghanta lagata he
 That means i could sit and watch the game in fun for one and a half hours
 lekin sirf saat ran par do wicket girane or unamem bhi ek rahul dravid ke jane se khel asahneeya ho gaya
 How many embarrassing and devastating defeats have been seen in India! But now it is not tolerable
 tivi band kiya or apane bathroom main aakar apane ko bhi band kar liya
 i was applying soap on the brush to shave
 bijli jane se raahat bhi mil sakati he aisa pehali baar laga or main nishcintata se dadhi par brush ghumaane laga
 Now i did not have to go out and get sad, upset and frustrated by watching TV in the meeting
 kanpur main green park par jo bhi ho rahaa ho apane kamare ke bathroom kii ret main gahare tak sir gadaaye main shuturamurg surakshit dadhi bana rahaa tha
 Who knows more than yourself that the head of the Ostrich in the sand does not stop the desert darkness
 marataa vahi he jo sir gada kar aandhi se bachane kii koshish karata he
 One can escape from the quickest and the fiercest sandstorm, whose roots are deep in the ground under the sand
 kya karegi odhi? zyada se zyada pattey uda le jaaegi
 Will break some new, green and flexible branches
 lekin ret ke neeche kii jameen or jameen ke neeche bhi pattharon kii parat kii chattaanon kii daraaron main jodon ko pahunchaakar khadaa ratane vaala pedaandhiyon se nahin darataa
 He keeps facing them
 batch to ghaas bhi jaati he lekin vah aandhi se juujhati nahin
 Let him pass on his own
 bounsar ko jhukkar upar se nikal jane dena bhi tufaani gendbaaj ko haraana he or thodaa bagal main hat kar gend ko hook kar dena bhi aag ko aag se bujhaana he
 This is that the ducker is not out and the hooker may get stuck somewhere
 dak karne vaala bhi tufaani gendbaaj kaa manobal giraata he or hook karke chakka maarane vaala bhi
 These are the two ways to defeat the wind
 ballebaaj apane swabhaav se kheltaa he
 Vivian Richards used to kill Hook
 ve bhi mahaan ballebaaj hue or sunil gavaskar dak karte the ve bhi mahaan hue
 Sunil Gavaskar scored more runs, more centuries and played more and longer innings than Richards but he never dominated like Vivian Richards
 lekin gavaskar ne tufaani gendbaajon kaa jitna saamana kiya or unhen thakaa kar jitna parajeet kiya richards ne nahin kiya
 The fire suppresses fire for a while but it is extinguished by water
 lekin dak karnaa yaa hook karnaa aapaki banat, swabhaav or charitra main he
 Before starting the innings, the guard you take, that is, you decide your place of play, then it is decided what you are going to do and what you can do
 aapane dekh hi liya hoga ki garam ret main sir gadaaye main shaam ke kaarykram kii taiyaari main lag gaya tha
 Moving from cricket to life and from life to cricket can mean understanding and speaking
 jo samajhate hai ki cricket sirf ek khel he or vahiyaat khel he ve nahin jaanate ki jivan bhi aakhir ek khel hi he
 Calling him a Vahiyat or an imperialist pastime does not make him anti-life
 ghor se ghor janavaadee bhi aakhir cricket nahin kheltaa he
 The more you play, the more democratic it is because playing cricket and living life is the end of your character, character and thought
 aapke haath kaa balla kabhi bandook, kabhi kalam, kabhi kuchi, kabhi fawda or kabhi computer kaa keyboard ho jaataa he
 For example, getting ready in the bathroom and thinking about the evening's program was like ducking at a bouncer coming from Kanpur or on my head
 dak karte hue hi jab main kurtaa pahan rahaa tha to baahar telephone kii ghanti baji
 And it kept ringing because Bhenji or Ladi, who picked up the phone, might have fallen asleep and Ramsih would be in his room upstairs
 aakhir main hi baahar aayaa or phone uthaaya
 So you have one-cabin reference started
 hev ui
 
 
 Passed out of my mouth
 yas, by, at vikets? tendulkar and gandhi did it
 i wished to keep the phone and open the TV and see - maybe the award ceremony is still going on
 phir yaad aayaa ki bijli to he nahin dekhuunga kya
 Kept talking on the phone kevin ne phone mujhe match ke bare main bataane ke liye nahin kiya tha
 He must have been sitting in the hotel looking for a way to get a call from the Prime Minister's office and would have been watching the match to cut the time
 yarkshire kaa yah apana dost kovin rephart yarkshire ke hi kal ke thos ballebaaj or ab ke camentricar referi boycott jaisaa bolta he
 Bycott failed to do his MA by studying at Queen's College, Oxford
 england main roji ke liye cricket khilne vaale college nahin jate
 But whether you study in Oxford or JNU in Cambridge or in Bhagalpur, your tone of speaking in the mother tongue has not changed
 isliye kevin se baat karte hue aksar lagata he ki boycott se baat kar rahe hai
 Both are equally unstable and blunt in their lives and are therefore completely rejected in some places and tolerated in others
 maine jab tivi band kiya to boycott hi us par bol rahe the
 In his Yorkshire tone and tone, he was saying that i have seen India winning and losing by winning many times
 kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 Yet the score of eighty two is not so big that India could not make it
 phir thodi der baad unhone kaha ki mujhe achraj he ki vishwa cricket main unniis baar chauthi pari main jeetne ke liye bayasi ran banane main timen fail hue hai
 And India itself was out in Barbados two years ago in less than two hundred, even though the target was not one hundred and twenty, but the mention of that defeat of Barbados as soon as the ghosts of all the losers whose souls had awakened in me Remained, we could have won the series by winning that Test on that tour of the West Indies, only to score 120 runs
 hamaari team main tendulkar, dravid, ganguli ke alaava bade anbhavi ajahar or siddh bhi the
 Tendulkar was the captain
 lekin puri team badi dayaniyata main dekhte-dekhte assi-bayasi par dher ho gai
 Playing Walsh and Ambrose was impossible
 yah vahi test, vah pari or vahi paraajay thi jiske dauraan bharat ke sabase anbhavi ballebaaj ajahar ne pich par se choubees baras ke captain sachin se puchhawaya tha ki ve rakshaatmak dhang se khelen yaa hamalavar rukh apnaayen? ye vahi ajahar the jo san nabbe main captain banane ke baad se lagaataar kehete rahe the ki jo bharat kii team main liye jane laayak ho use yah bhi maaloom hona chahie ki kab kaisaa khelnaa chahie
 What should i tell someone? Not surprisingly, we lost badly
 kehete hai tendulkar ne kamare main jaakar andar se taala laga liya or lakh bulaane par bhi baahar nahin aae
 Boycott said that he was in Warbedoss then and was commentating
 vah test maine bhi dekha tha ball by ball or us din maine bahut chaha tha ki dharti fat jaae or usee main dafan ho jaaon
 The shame of being an Indian was not tolerated that day
 sahi he ki cricket aakhir ek khel he or bharat ne saikadon test khele hai, or unamem zyaadaatar haara hi he
 But the country which could not win even after coming so close to victory, there is some fundamental flaw in its design and it is not possible to find and overcome it
 apane ko andheri or andhi surang main paane or usase nikal baahar hone kaa rasta na bana paane kii sthiti sirf cricket main nahin he
 You will find that this situation is everywhere in cricket which makes it visible
 jo kehete hai ki hamamen killer instict yani shikaar ko pakadakar maar dene kii kshamta nahin he ve kahi-kahai or rati-ratai baat karte hai
 The animal hunting practice is the same in Indians as in others
 hamamen koi jaivik kami nahin he
 There is definitely a blind spot in our psyche that comes in front of our eyes while holding the poisonous snake and removing its poisonous tooth, and we stumble
 or us ghaatak thithak kaa phayda uthaakar saanp hamaari mutthi se nikalakar hamen dank maar jaataa he
 We do not make any attempt to scratch our psyche by catching this blind spot
 jahaan karte hai vahaan vah safal hoti dikhti nahin he
 Boycott was saying when Ramesh was dismissed and Dravid came out that he was the only batsman best suited for this position
 ve sachin kii tarah pratibhashali or mahaan na hon lekin thos or sthitprajna swabhaav ke khilaadi hai
 If Sachin gets set, he can win the world in two minutes but can also go to the first ball
 dravid inch dar inch faasla tay karne vaale sahi or dhirajwan ballebaaj hai
 Boycott's statement was still going on that Dravid started returning through LBW
 ‘abhi chaay banane main mat lagie, abhi bahut kuch hona he' -boycott aisa kah rahe the ki main tivi band karke uth gaya tha
 But later on the same TV, Sachin smiled watching India win from New Zealand
 mohali ke pehle test main bhi bharat ko jeet kii haalat main laane vaale sachin tendulkar ek sau chhbbees par avijit rahe the
 But his innings was the captain's innings which was holding one end and Dravid and Ganguly went ahead and were raising the mountain of India
 sachin par jaise do bandhan the-ek captain hone kaa or doosraa ridh kii haddi se peeth kii mansapeshiyon main ai chot kaa
 Both were preventing him from playing freely
 lekin kanpur kii duusari pari main bharat ko jitaane ke liye sachin ne chadhakar ballebaaji kii or bayasi kaa jo lakshya aath sau bees ban rahaa tha use nau do gyaarah kar diya
 He is the same Sachin Tendulkar who was being said a month ago that the spine is breaking his great career in the middle
 ab ve rukkar or bich main aaraam kar-karke hi khel sakenge
 And after such bonding, will you be able to do everything that is expected from them for ten years? But it seems that the backbone does not hurt his back muscles much, so Sachin has started playing well
 isse vah utavlaapan or dussahasikta unki ballebaaji se ghat gai he jo aksar uske patan kaa kaaran banati rahi he
 This may not make him a smoky batsman like he has been till now, but restraint and discipline make him an even bigger batsman

 jisamen unhone kaha he ki jis cricket board ne pakistaniyon ko hindustan main nyauta bheja he, usee cricket board ko mumbai ke tajmahal hotel auki chhatrapati shivaji terminus stesan par chaabuk se peetna chahie
 This cricket game of the Gentlemen has now become a game of shameless and ruthless people
 itane besharm auki nirday log yadi is desh main he to is desh ko pakistan banane main kitna samay lagegaa
 Bal Thackeray further wrote that in the 26 / 11 terror attack many people lost their lives and many policemen sacrificed
 yah jaanate hue bhi jo faisla cricket board ne liya he wo desh se gaddari jaisaa he
 After independence, the game of cricket happened many times after independence, but each time the game has become less crusade in the cricket field
 kashmir se lekar dakshin bharat main kai baar bam dhamaake hue
 Bal Thackeray said that the Congress is doing this to get Muslim votes
 thakare ne likhaa yadi ham shanti bharaa paigaam lekar kabutar udaate rahe tab bhi pakistan bandook kii goliyaan chalaane se baj nahin aaenge
 Taking the lives of innocent people of India by bombing will not stop
 isliye pakistan ke saath shantivaarta karnaa ek dhong he auki cricket khelnaa ek rashtradroh he
 Bal Thackeray has praised Sunil Gavaskar, saying that we are happy with the way Gavaskar condemned the decision to play cricket
 rajeev shukla ne ise bhale hi gavaskar kaa nijee vichaar bataaya he, lekin hamaare mutabik sunil gavaskar ne wo baat kahi he jo is desh kii 100 karod janata sochati he
 Countrymen think that cricket should not be fought with Pakistan
 bal thakare ne is mudde par maharashtra sarkaar ko bhi aade haathon liya he
 He has written that Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan should stand at the memorial of 26 / 11 martyr Tukaram Ombale and declare that he will not allow Pakistanis to enter the city
 jo cricket premi yah baat samajhataa he use in maichon ko nahin dekhne janaa chahie
 The empty stadium itself will be a protest against Pakistan and a tribute to the martyrs of 26 / 11
 rajeev shukla, sharad pavaar yah sabhi khushi se stadium main jaakar yah match dekhen

 The BJP is moving towards its mission of Congress-mukt Bharat, but after the defeat of the BJP in some recent by-elections and the formation of a coalition government in Karnataka, a new energy has also flowed among the anti-bjp parties
 iskaa nateeja ye hua ki congress vipakshi ekajutata ke sahare aage bhi apni chunavi baitaraniyan paar lagane kii yojana main lagi hui he
 Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati is the most important pawn in the Congress' electoral chess
 isaki vajah 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav to he hi, usase pehle rajasthan, madhyapradesh or chhattisgarh main kuch maheene baad hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav bhi hai
 Perhaps this is the reason that when the leaders of opposition parties gathered at the swearing-in ceremony of HD Kumaraswamy of JDS in Bengaluru, UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi embraced Mayawati with great vigor
 karnataka kii us tasviir ke baad ab khabar ye bhi aane lagi he ki congress basapa ke saath milakar in teenon rajyon (rajasthan, madhyapradesh or chhattisgarh) main chunaav lard sakati he
 In fact, behind this strategy of the Congress, BSP has a decisive presence in these states, in which the Congress sees a ray of hope
 philhal teenon hi rajyon main bijepi kii sarkaar he
 If we look at the figures for the 2013 assembly elections of Madhya Pradesh, BJP got 165 seats out of total 230 seats and its vote percentage was 44
 88 tha
 At the same time, 36 to Congress
 38% vot share ke saath 58 siton par jeet mili thi
 Although the BSP won only 4 seats, its vote percentage was 6
 43% rahaa tha
 Not only this, BSP stood second in 11 seats
 in sabhi siton par bispi ummidavaaron ne bijepi ko kadi takkar di thi
 In such a situation, the BJP may have to suffer losses in the event of an alliance between the Congress and the BSP
 rajasthanrajasthan vidhansabha kii kul 200 siton main bijepi ke paas 163 siten hai
 In the 2013 elections, BJP won 45
 2% vot hasil kiya tha
 While Congress 33
 1% ke saath 21 seat or 3
 The BSP was able to win 3 seats with 4% votes
 teen siton par bispi ranor-ap rahi or usne bijepi ko takkar di
 The interesting thing is that the BSP, which is called the party of Dalits, won all three general seats only
 jabaki anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit 34 siton main se 33 par bijepi ne paracham laharaaya tha or ek seat par anya ko jeet mili thi
 Despite this, the votes of Congress and BSP together can give a tough challenge to BJP
 chhattisgarh2013 ke chhattisgarh vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko kul 90 main se 49 siton par jeet mili thi or party ne apane dam par sarkaar banaai thi
 The BJP had 41% of the vote, while the Congress had 40
 3% vot ke saath mahaj 39 seat mil pai thim
 4 to the BSP 3% ke saath 1 seat mili thi
 In such a situation, it would have been difficult for the BJP to form a government if the congress-bsp had contested the elections together
 yahi vajah he ki congress ko mayawati kaa saath jaruri najar aa rahaa he
 However, Congress is also targeting UP on the pretext of these states
 darasal, upi main congress kii sthiti behad kharaab he
 Whereas in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the Congress is in the role of the main opposition party
 aise main 2019 ke aam chunaav main vipakshi ekajutata kaa formula jab taiyaar hoga to congress upi main zyada se zyada siten hasil kar chunaav ladane kii koshish karegi
 On the other hand, Mayawati has announced to agree to an alliance only after getting respectable seats
 mana ja rahaa he ki congress agar empi, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main bispi ke liye dil kholti he or use paryaapt seat detii he to iske badale use upi main bahanji se kuch siten milane kii ummid bandhegi
 If there is a grand alliance in UP, there will not be too many seats for the Congress if there is a seat-sharing between the SP and the BSP
 aise main party pehle se hi mayawati kaa dil jeetne main lagi hui he

 Till now it seemed that no one is going to see the suffering of these innocent children, but the Maharashtra government has ordered the parents to ensure that their children are at least underweight
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne ek prastaav paarit karte hue kaha he ki rajya kaa koi bhi baccha skool jate vakt apane sharir ke vazan se 10 pratishat zyada ke vazan kaa bag nahin uthayega
 Five-year-olds studying in class 1 have to keep their bags on the scales as soon as they enter the class so that the teacher can check that the weight of the bag is 2
 5 kilo se zyada to nahin he
 The government has stated in its proposal that 4 children of the eighth age of 12 years
 2 kilo se zyada vazani bag nahin uthaaenge taaki kisi lambii beemaari se bachaa ja sake
 The comments sthaneey shiksha sachiv ne shaskeey aadesh main likhaa he ki niyam ke anusaar bacchon kaa bag unke vazan ke das pratishat se zyada nahin hona chahie
 But we have come to know that due to thick book-copy, inexplicable stationery and even cosmetics, the weight of the bag is 20 to 30 percent
 ye khatarnaak he
 This can lead to tiredness, tension as well as pain of the spinal cord and joints
 isse bachche kii sehat par bura asar padataa he
 Significantly, in the constantly increasing competition environment, there is constant pressure on the children to do good studies, so parents are often kept in their bags for the evening tuition
 sarkaar ne apane aadesh main kaha he ki homework or timeteble main kuch badlaav hone chahie taaki bacchon ko har din dher kitaaben naa lani pade
 Also, parents should not fill the children's bags with unnecessary items
 haalanki is aadesh main vazan se jude in niyamon kaa ullaghann karne par milane vaali sazaa kaa koi zikr nahin kiya gaya he
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has passed a resolution saying that no child in the state will carry a bag weighing 10 percent more than his body weight while going to school
 kaksha 1 main padhane vaale paanch saal ke bacchon ko class main ghuste hi apane baste ko taraazoo par rakhana hota he taaki teacher check kar saken ki bag kaa vazan 2
 Not more than 5 kg
 sarkaar ne apane prastaav main kaha he ki 12 saal ke aathvin ke bachche 4
 Do not carry more than 2 kg weight bags so that a long illness can be avoided
 tippaniyan The local education secretary has written in a government order that according to the rule, children's bags should not exceed ten percent of their weight
 lekin hamen pataa chalaa he ki moti moti kitaab-copy, bevajaah kii steshnari or yahaan tak kii cosmatics kii vajah se baste kaa vazan 20 se 30 pratishat ho jaataa he
 This is dangerous
 isse thakaavat,tanaav ke saath saath reed kii haddi or jodon main dard kii samasya bhi ho sakati he
 This affects the health of the child
 gauratlab he ki lagaataar badhate pratispardhaa ke maahaul main bacchon par acchhee padhai karne kaa lagaataar dabaav bana rahata he isliye abhibhavak aksar unke bag main shaam ko lagane vaali tution kaa saamaan bhi rakh diya jaataa he
 The government has said in its order that there should be some changes in homework and timetables so that children do not have to bring a lot of books every day
 saath hi abhibhavak bhi bevajaah ke saamaan se bacchon kaa bag naa bharen
 However, in this order there is no mention of punishment for violating these rules related to weight
 sthaneey shiksha sachiv ne shaskeey aadesh main likhaa he ki niyam ke anusaar bacchon kaa bag unke vazan ke das pratishat se zyada nahin hona chahie
 But we have come to know that due to thick book-copy, inexplicable stationery and even cosmetics, the weight of the bag is 20 to 30 percent

 1 karod ghar khaali pade hai or sarkaar 2022 tak sabko ghar ke apane lakshya ke tahat chaahati he ki ye makaan kiraaye par uthaae jaaen
 The government says that existing laws discourage rental housing
 lihaaja maalik apane khaali gharon ko kabje ke dar se kiraaye par nahin uthaanaa chaahate
 The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs states that this law is being brought in order to maintain a sense of transparency and accountability between the tenant and the owner, while remaining in the judicial realm, while balancing the interests of both
 lekin iskaa doosraa pahalu ye he ki sarkaar kiraayedaar or makaan maalik ke bich taang fansaakar unke len-dene ko aupchaarik karnaa chaahati he taaki rent par stamp duty kaa paisa khajaane main aa sake
 Now except metro cities, rent agreement has not been practiced in small cities
 itnaa hi nahin metro shaharon main bhi kaaphi sankhya main chote makaanon kaa agreement nahin hota he
 State governments have also set stamp duty on rent separately
 maharashtra main chauthai fisadi ke saath 11 maheenon ke rifundable diposit par byaaj sarkaar ko dena hota he jabaki uttar pradesh main 4 fisadi kii stamp duty kirename par lagati he
 However, delhi-noida has a 2% stamp duty on the rent agreement
 baharhaal, nayaa kanoon kiraayedaaron or maalikon donon ke samjhaute ko ek vyavsaayik rup detaa he
 It is necessary to know its proposed provisions
 iske tahat har jile main rent atharity hogi
 The District Collector will be posted by the Rent Authority on the orders of the State Government and the Officer of the Rent Authority Deputy Collector rank will be made
 iske alaava kiraaya court bhi honge
 The process of tenancy will be something like this - both the tenant and the owner will inform the rent authority as soon as they rent the real estate
 rent athurity rent agreement milte hi sabhi pakshon ko unic aaidi number degaa
 Also, all the documents including the agreement will be uploaded on the digital platform within seven days of the agreement being received
 agar agreement kii miyaad khatm ho jaati he or kirenama kaa navinikaran nahin hua he to aisi paristhiti main puraane kirename kii dar par masik kiraaya lagu hoga lekin ye vyavastha chah maheene se zyada nahin chalegi
 If the relationship between landlord-tenant is good then everything is fine
 agar jhagada hoga to kiraayedaar ko makaan khaali karnaa hi hoga
 Strict provisions have been made for tenants who do not vacate houses
 agreement kii sharton ke mutabik makaan na khaali karne par makaan maalik muaavja lene kaa hakdaar ho jayega
 This compensation will be doubled in the first two months and then four times in the following months
 agar kiraaye kaa advance makaan maalik ne le liya he to use vah khaali karte vakt kiraayedaar ko lautaanaa hoga
 Unable to do so, he will have to return the amount including interest
 makaan maalik ko kiraaye kii raseed deni hogi or electronic madhyam se kiraaye kaa bhugtan hone par bank tranjaction kii pavati hi raseed maani jaaegi
 The damage or maintenance of the house will be charged according to the rent agreement
 agar ye kiraayedaar notice dene ke baad bhi sharton ke mutabik mentanence yaa marammat nahin karata to makaan maalik marammat karakar paisa security diposit se kaat saktaa he
 But if the amount of repair is more than the security deposit, it will be required by law to pay it to the tenant within one month of the landlord's notice
 agar marammat kaa jimmaa maalik kaa he or wo ise nahin kara rahaa he to kiraayedaar agreement kii sharton ke mutabik marammat karakar rakam kiraaye se kaat saktaa he
 But he cannot do that in the name of repairing the rent
 use kiraaye kaa 50 fisadi se zyada kaatane kaa adhikaar nahin hoga
 If the house becomes dilapidated and the owner does not get it repaired, the tenant can leave the house before the agreement by order of the authority by giving written notice of 15 days
 makaan maalik ke kiraayedaar ke makaan ke bheetar daakhil hone kii bhi shart he
 He will give written or electronic message to the tenant 24 hours in advance for any repairs, in which the reasons for the repair etc
 will be clearly written
 maalik subah 7 se raat 8 baje ke dauraan hi marammat karaane kaa kaam kar sakegaa
 Apparently these are some of the provisions that were not yet codified
 inke samhitabaddh hone se jo log saaf suthra hisaab rakhana chaahate hai unhen sahuuliyat hogi
 But the real problem will be in the capital Delhi where there is a lot of opposition to this law
 kuch kiraayedaar saalon se dukaanon main jame hue hai or maamuli kiraaya dekar beshkeemtee sampatti par kabja jamaaye hai
 Many such cases will also be found in the old areas of small cities
 inke liye ye kanoon kargar sabit hona chahie
 (manish Dixit is Assistant Editor in India Today) *** himachal pradesh ke kai hisson main guuruuvaar tadake kam tivrata ke bukamp ke jatke mahasoos kiye gaye
 However, there has been no loss of life and property due to the earthquake so far
 tippaniyan Meteorological Department official said that 4 in the morning
 12 baje richter paimaane par 3
 An earthquake of 3 magnitude was recorded
 bukamp kaa centre kullu kshetra rahaa
 Earthquake tremors were also felt in Himachal's adjoining Mandi district

 ) mausam vibhaag ke adhikari ne bataaya ki subah 4
 3 on the Richter scale at 12 o'clock
 3 tivrata kaa bukamp darj kiya gaya
 The epicenter of the earthquake was Kullu region
 himachal se sate mandi jile main bhi bukamp ke jatke mahasoos kiye gaye
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 )(hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) adhikariyon ne pehle ise haadase main hui maut bataaya tha
 But after the post mortem in 2013, it was declared a murder
 rud ek etorni or ek skool board ke sadsy bhi rah chuke hai
 In 2015, he was charged with murder
 abhiyojak ne kaha ki rud ne isliye hatya kii taaki vah beemaa raashi ke 1,00,000 america dollar paa saken
 Her prosecutor said the woman's death was a 'tragic accident' and there is a lack of concrete evidence in the case
 viraat kohli kii ipel team royal chalangers bangalore (aaarasibi) ne utyub par mangalvaar ko ek video aplod kiya tha, jise ab tak ek lakh se zyaada baar dekha ja chukaa he
 The video shows an unidentified person sneaking in during the shooting of Virat and reached directly to Virat
 is vyakti ne viraat se kaha ki ve donon isse pehle kabhi nahin mili hai, kyonki 'ek hi kamare main do superstar nahin rah sakate
 
 
 Not only this, then this person started teaching Kohli how to speak dialogues
 jab nirdeshak ne mahasoos kiya ki viraat kohli apana aapa khote ja rahe hai, tab unhone us vyakti ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya
 Whether this meeting of Virat and this 'intruder' was planned in advance, and whether this 'intruder' was any taught person of RCB, decide this by watching the video yourself
 
 
 yaad rakhane vaali baat yah he ki ham sabhi isse pehle kai baar kohli ke gusse kaa gubaar footataa dekh chuke hai
 During the IPL in 2013, his debate with Gautam Gambhir was in the news
 haal hi main viraat kohli ne unase apni garlfriend abhinetri anoushka sharma ke bare main baat karne vaale ek patrkaar ko gaali di thi
 Apart from this, he once argued aggressively with the officials on the field when he was given out by a third umpire during a match played against Zimbabwe
 so, ham to yahi kahenge - yah shaks jo bhi tha, bahut himmat dikhaai, dost
 
 
 Women like their praise very much
 baavjood iske wo kai baar complement acept karne kii bajaay topic change kar detii hai
 This leads to a wrong message in the office
 ghar or offis ko balance karne main aap itani mehnat karti he, aise main koi acchhee cheez aap tak aa rahi he to aane den
 Some tips given here will help you in this
 topic change na karenisse koi fark nahin padataa ki aap tarif paakar kitni pareshaan yaa aniji ho jaati hai
 Do not express this feeling
 yun samaj len ki complement aapkaa haq tha
 If you have any supplement on the workplace, then accept it with smile
 kadi mehnat ke baad milane vaali tarif hameshaa acchhee lagati he
 Don't forget to say thank you
 You may make fun of the supplement, but don't forget to say thank you at the end of the conversation
 aap apni team or unki mehnat kaa zikr bhi kar sakati hai
 How did your team support you? tarif kaa ritern tarif nahinkoi aapaki tarif kare, iskaa matlab yah nahin ki ritern main aap bhi uski tarifon ke pul baandh den
 First listen to what the person in front is saying
 uske baad kuch baalen
 Instead of praising directly, it can be said at the end of the conversation that you too helped me a lot
 body language ho thikjab koi complement de to apni hatheliyaan na dekhen
 Some girls start playing with clothes or pens as soon as they get compliments
 ye aapaki nervasness kii nishaani he
 Look directly into the eye instead
 halki smil or gres ke saath tarif ko sweekaar karen
 This facepack will not improve beauty treatment but will improve the face 
 
 eemaandaaree bhi jaruricomplement milane ke baavjood agar aapako aisa lagata he ki aapane wo mukaam hasil nahin kiya he, jiske liye aapako shaabaasi milani chahie to behad vinamrata se kahen ki ab bahutkamakarna baaki he
 But it's nice to know that I'm on the right track
 5 saal kii muhabbat ko mukaam mila, tosaf ali khan or karinashaadi ke bandhan main bandha gaye
 Saif and Kareena came in front of the world and told that yes we have become husband and wife
 parantu is shaadi ke baad islam ke lihaaj se kuch ahm sawaal bhi khadey ho gaye hai
 Doubtsaf and Kareena became husband and wife with doubts over the acceptance of marriage, but with a question
 sawaal islamic taur par bada he, isliye kyonki karina kii shaadi saf ali khan ke saath hui he or is shaadi ko islamic taur par sweekaar nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 On the afternoon of 16 October, Saif and Kareena performed a civil marriage in Mumbai, that is, according to the Indian law, they became husband and wife
 is shaadi main koi bhi tamzam nahin tha
 Only a few guests from Bollywood also came to Mumbai
 karina kapur kii badi bahan karishma is shaadi kii gavaah thim
 darul-uloom has given his verdict on Saif and Kareena's wedding
 
 
 
 So what will the Qazi do? a saying has been going on for centuries that mian-biwi will agree, so what will Qazi do
 ab isamen qaazi kyon kud rahe hai, samaj main nahin aa rahaa he
 Saidan Saif and Kareena are united, but Islam's ulema is questioning this
 devband ke daarul ulum ne bhi saf-karina kii shaadi ko mazahabi etbaar se jaays nahin tehraaya he
 According to Darul Uloom Marriage 'illegitimate' Darul Uloom, a world-renowned Islamic institution, has refused to accept this marriage as legitimate
 saf or karina kii shaadi ko 72 ghante bhi nahin guzare ki shaadi ko lekar vivaad khadaa ho gaya
 According to Darul Uloom, the biggest screw in this wedding is that Kareena Kapoor is still Kareena
 is shaadi main vivaad yah he ki jab tak ladkaa-ladki islam main daakhil na hon, shariat is shaadi kii ijazat nahin detii he
 Giving an opinion on Saif and Kareena's wedding, a spokesperson of Darul Uloom said that they do not want to issue any fatwa on it
 Darul Uloom says that leave this marriage, most marriages in Bollywood are not according to Islam
 saf-karina ne kii he registerd marijgauratlab he ki saf ali khan or karina kapur ne registerd shaadi kii he
 Saif has written his name Sajid Ali Khan at the time of his marriage to Kareena, which is his real name
 ab kanoon ke hisaab se to donon pati-patni ban gaye hai, lekin islam ke mutabik is shaadi main kai pech hai
 Darul Uloom of Deoband also says that children born in such a marriage will also not be considered legitimate
 agar wo islam kabool kar lete hai, to wo us surat main islam main daakhil ho sakate hai
 But here once again the same saying fits what Mian Biwi Raazi will do, Kazi
