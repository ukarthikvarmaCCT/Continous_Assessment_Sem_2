 Of the 19 terrorists who carried out 9 / 11, 15 were from Saudi Arabia
 to america ko hamalaa kis par karnaa chahie tha ? lekin puure arab world main aaj yadi america kaa sabase bharosemand saathi koi he to vah he saudi arab
 According to US intelligence agencies, the world's largest terrorist organizations are still getting the most funding from the people of Saudi Arabia and some of its institutions, but the US says that it is its biggest partner in the fight against terror
 kya rahasy he is dosti kaa-dosti: america ke saath
 
 
 -saudi Arabia and America are closely related to the time of the Cold War
 saudi arab ne communist vichaardhaara ko islam virdohi tak qaraar diya tha
 In such a situation, when it came to pushing Russia from Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia helped America a lot
 us daur se hi america ke sainya thikaane saudi arab main hai
 When it came to the involvement of Saudi citizens in the 9 / 11 attack, the government there acted without any hesitation
 america kaa bharosa or badha
 In 2003, terrorists carried out the blasts in the area of riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, where most foreigners lived
 us ghatana ke baad se is arab desh main aatankiyon ke khilaaf sakht abhiyaan chalaae gaye
 The largest business in America in Arab countries is from Saudi Arabia
 vah america ko sasta petroleum detaa he or kai anya utpaadon kaa aayaat karata he
 Funding: In favor of terrorists
 
 
 -2005 main yues tregeri vibhaag ke adhikari ne congress ke saamne bayaan diya ki saudi sarkaar se anudaan paane vaali kai charity sansthaaen pichley 25 saal se duniya ke alag-alag hisson main aisi vichaardhaara bhadakaane waalon kii madad kar rahi hai, jo aatankwaad panpa rahe hai
 In 2003, a former State Department official made a statement before the Congress that the Saudi Arabian charity al-harman Islamic Foundation funded the Egyptian terrorist organization Gama al-islamiyah
 -may 2004 main state department ke usee purv afasar ne yah bhi bayaan diya ki saudi arab kii do sabase badi charity sansthaaon international islamic relif orgenigeshan or da world muslim lig duniyabar main maujuud islamic aatanki sanghathanon kii madad kar rahi hai
 Val Hamza Zulaydan, a member of the Saudi Charitable Community, was told that he helps many terrorists associated with Al Qaeda
 khaastaur par aise aatanki, jo dakshini europe main sakriy hai
 Not only that, according to the 9 / 11 commission investigation report, Al Qaeda took money and other help from many Saudi people and charity institutions to carry out their exploits
 haalanki kamishan aise kai maamalon ke baavjood yah saboot nahin juta paaya ki aatankiyon ko milane vaali saudi madad ke bare main vahaan kii sarkaar ko bhi jaankaree thi yaa nahin
 Saudi Arabia is at the root of fundamentalism
 Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world which is built on the strength of Jihad
 1932 main vahaan ke ek kabeelai sardaar abdul ajij al-saood ne ek bade hisse par kabja kiya or apane naam par hi use ek desh ke rup main ghoshit kar diya
 To strengthen his power, he took the influential people (wahabis) of the area along
 wahabi kattar islamic manyataon ko maanane vaale the
 In this way, a regime with staunch Islamic laws began to operate in Saudi Arabia
 petroleum kaa paisa or makka kii ahmiyat1950 ke dashak main saudi arab main petroleum kaa pataa chalaa
 In the 60s and 70s, due to this money started raining
 lekin wahabiyon ko chahie thi mulk main islamic kattarta
 In 1965, the Wahhabi sabotaged and removed all the pictures in the country
 is tark ke hawaale se ki islam main tasviren jaij nahin hai
 The Wahhabis also removed photographs of the Saudi emperor
 police or wahabiyon main itnaa sangharsh badha ki isamen saudi ke king faijal kii hatya kar di gai
 Even after this, the matter did not calm down
 1979 main to wahabiyon ke ek gut ne haj ke dauraan makka par hamalaa bol diya or pavitra masjid ko apane kabje main le liya
 There was a struggle about two weeks and many people died
 iske baad se saudi sarkaar ne is pavitra jagah par niyantran ko kabhi kamjor nahin hone diya
 The king also survived and the status continued to grow, in that era, while there were movements against dictatorship and support of democracy throughout Arabia, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia remained there
 misr, libya, tunisia, syria, iraq, iraan, yaman, philistin, sudan jaise arab deshon main uthal-puthal machi rahi, lekin saudi arab se koi pratikriya nahin ai
 The government there is happy with the monopoly over its petrol and mecca-medina economy

 com / 9dj7n2abym The Supreme Court on Friday expressed 'unhappiness' over the comments of some Union ministers, including Law Minister Kapil Sibal, against the verdict on homosexuality, saying it was 'inappropriate' and 'not in good humor'
 nyaayalay ne iske saath hi unhen bhavishya main aisa karne ke prati aagaah kiya he
 The bench headed by Chief Justice p Sadasivam, who was unhappy after observing the statements attached to the PIL filed for action against these ministers, said the comments against the verdict were 'not commendable'
 nyaayadhishon ne kaha, 'ham sahamat hai ki kuch bayaan to achche nahin hai
 They hold high positions and have responsibilities
 unhen bayaan dete samay saavdhaanee baratani chahie

 We consider this to be inappropriate comments
 ' The judges said that the statement of the Finance Minister is not very objectionable, but some comments from others were not in good humor
 iske baavjood nyaayalay ne in netaaon ke khilaaf koi bhi aadesh dene se inkaar kar diya
 All these leaders have been made parties individually in this matter
 nyaayadhishon ne kaha, 'apni aprasannataa jaahir karne ke alaava ham kuch nahin kar sakate hai
 Although this statement is not praiseworthy, we are not considering the petition

 yachikakarta ke vakil echpi sharma ne daleel di ki in mantriyon ke bayaan sheersh adaalat dwaara pratipaadit vyavastha kaa ulanghan hai or iske liye unke khilaaf karrwai kii jaani chahie
 The petition said that the Center was a party to it and had the right to amend the law, but if the dispute came to the apex court, it is the duty of the ministers and the chief minister to honor the decision rather than humiliating the decision
 yachika main kaha gaya tha ki mantriyon ne samvidhan kii anusuchee-teen ke tahat lee gai shapath kaa ulanghan kiya he
 Therefore, his appointment is unconstitutional and illegal
 sheersh adaalat ne samalangik younachaar ko aparaadh ke daayre se baahar karne sambandhi dilli ucch nyaayalay kaa 2 july, 2009 kaa nirnay nirast karte hue 11 disambar ko kaha tha ki bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 377 sanvaidhanik he or isamen kisi prakaar kii truti nahin he
 This decision of the court was opposed across the country and was criticized by people from different sections of society including ministers
 iske baad kendra sarkaar or samalangik adhikaron ke kaaryakartaaon ne is nirnay par punarvichaar ke liye sheersh adaalat main yachika daayar kar rakhi he

 Honored with the Padma Vibhushan in 2005, Manna Dey was honored with the Padma Shri in 1971 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2005, honored with the Manna Dekai National Awards, State Governments of Honor and numerous awards for Best Singer

 'tamanna' first film Themanna Dey lent her voice as a playback singer for the first time in the film 'tamannaah' in 1943 and after that it gradually became a solid pillar of Hindi film music
 1950 se 1970 ke dashak ko hindi film sangeet kaa svarnim yug kaha jaataa he or ise svarnim banane main manna de kii sunahari aawaaj kaa bahut bada yogadan rahaa
 He, along with Mohammed Rafi, Kishore Kumar and Mukesh, laid a strong foundation for Indian film music
 kisi bhi film kaa sangeet in chaaron kii pursoj aawaaj ke bina adhuraa mana jaataa tha or inamen bhi manna de ko shastreey sangeet kaa paarangat kaha jaae to galat nahin hoga
 Manna Dey has been fond of wrestling and boxing
 Prabodh Chandra Dey, born here on May 1, 1919, as Pooran Chandra and Mahamaya Dey, is known as Manna Dey
 bahut kam logon ko maaloom hoga ki manna de ko bachapan main pahalwani or mukkebaaji kaa shauk hua karata tha
 There is no similarity between the tough mood of rough rough wrestlers and the fine tune of singing, but Manna Dey harmonized the two beautifully

 His uncle Sangeetacharya k Dey made him aware of the nuances of music in a very short time and his sweet voice spared him the ability to make every song syrupy

 He then lent his voice for films like 'ram Rajya', 'kavita', 'mahakavi', 'vikramaditya', 'prabhu Ka Ghar', 'valmiki' and 'geet Govind'
 un dinon filmein bahut kam banati thim isliye vah bhi saal main ekaadh film main hi geet ga pate the
 Manna Dey has also sung for Raj Kapoor
 By the 50s, Manna Dey was established as a staunch playback singer and he has played 'awara', 'do Bigha Zameen', 'hamdard', 'parineeta', 'chitrangada', 'boot Parshaan for films like 'polish' and 'shree 420'

 com / zxdu8k9eyz It is such a bitter reality that whether Bihar is BJP or bjp's central leader, all are now assuming that if the decision was made to introduce a leader for the Chief Minister in Bihar, the party's choice would be Sushil Modi
 agar rajya main piem narendra modi ke naam par bhi vidhansabha chunaav ladaa gaya or bahumat kaa aankada mil jaataa he, to us paristhiti main bhi mukhyamantri susheel modi hi honge
 Party's National President Amit Shah will address a workers' conference in Patna on Tuesday and it is believed that the Bihar Legislative Assembly will usher in an election campaign for the elections
 is sammelan main kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh or bihar se kendriya mantrimandal main shaamil bijepi ke sabhi netaa maujuud rahenge
 But the question is whether Amit Shah will announce the name of that leader or say Sushil Modi as the chief ministerial candidate? If the leaders of the party agree, then Shah should announce it or not, but Sushil Modi for the post of Chief Minister All the leaders who have been challenged for the time being are isolated
 susheel modi ke paksh main kai baaten hai
 Even though many upper caste leaders in Bihar BJP oppose his name, it is true that there is no leader as effective as Modi for the central leadership, which is the proof that he is the last speaking leader in every program of the party Occur
 pichley hafte kendriya vitt mantri ne bihar ke liye package kii charchaa karne ke liye bihar se sabhi kendriya mantriyon ke alaava anya cabinet mantriyon kii baithak bulaai, to susheel modi ko patna se vishesh rup se bulaayaa gaya
 During the assembly session, Sushil Modi as the Leader of the Legislative Party every week not only calls a meeting, but how far the party has to go with Jitan Ram Manjhi, how far to keep and how far to keep, all Modi's strategy Happened according to party main susheel modi ke kattar virdohi bhi maanate hai ki party ke liye jitna samay modi dete hai, utana unke virdohi anya netaa milakar bhi nahin dete
 Whenever an incident happens in the state, the next day Modi does not delay in meeting the place or the affected people
 chunavi varsh hone ke kaaran bhi party main kise shaamil karnaa he, us par jab tak modi apni sahmati nahin dete, unka milan samaaroh nahin hota
 However, party leaders estimate that there may be more loss than profit once Modi's name is announced
 aam logon main nitish apane kaam kii vajah se abhi bhi pehali pasand bane hue hai
 Not only the leaders of the upper-caste party, but also the upper-caste voters can disguise Modi
 lekin filhal modi ke virdohi or mukhyamantri pad kii mahatvakanksha rakhane vaale sabhi netaa bhi ekajute ho jaaen, to modi se muqabla karne main wo bees sabit nahin ho sakate
 The biggest thing with Modi has been that he was the leader of opposition in Bihar for 9 years under Lalu Yadav and fiercely faced the Lalu government
 nitish mantrimandal main bhi party ne unhen up mukhyamantri banaaya to apane kaarykaal main vivaadon se zyada apane kaam ke kaaran jane jate rahe
 There has hardly been a single day in the last two years when relations with Nitish Kumar have been broken, when he has not used the sword of words to criticize the Nitish government
 inhen sab kaarnon se party ke paas 'upar modi, neeche modi' kaa naaraa lagane ke alaava bihar main koi zyada vikalp nahin bache hai

 koun kahata he ki bhavanaaen sirf insaanon main hoti hai? ham aapako bataane ja rahe hai ek aisi penguin kii kahani jo pyaar or apanepan ko mahasoos karne vaali bhaawanaaon kaa ek jeeta jaagta udhaaharan he
 This is the story of a penguin who travels 5000 miles every year through the sea
 yah penguin us insaan se milane aati he jisane uski jaan bachaai thi
 The story is of a village on an island in Brazil where a fishing man named Go Peria d'souza lives
 is vyakti kii umr 71 saal he
 In fact, in 2011, 5 years ago, this person had found a penguin soaked in oil in an unaccompanied condition on the seashore
 us samay yah penguin marane ke kareeb thi
 Seeing the Penguin, Jao immediately picked him up and took care of him cleanly with oil
 uske sharir ko majbootee dene ke liye use acha khaanaa bhi diya or bahut pyaar se penguin kaa naam 'dindim' rakhaa
 a week later Jao tried to release Penguin again into the sea but Penguin did not go
 thik hone ke 11 maheene baad tak penguin jaao ke saath hi rahi
 Jao told that but as soon as the new wings of Penguin came, she disappeared
 lekin kuch hi maheenon baad dindim waapas ai or jaao kaa peechha karte karte uske ghar tak gai
 Please tell that in the last 5 years, 8 months have been with Dindimjao
 ab jaao kaa bhi penguin se lagaav itnaa bad gaya he ki vah use apane bachche kii tarah pyaar karte hai
 Jao explains that every year she comes in June and leaves in February
 khaas baat yah he ki har baar wo mujhe dekhakar pehle se zyada khush najar aati he
 This is probably because now Penguin is also starting to take part of her family

 The film made 24 in four days
 75 karod ru
 Has done business is kamyaabi kii vajah se 27 varshiya aditya utsaah se labarej hai
 Excerpts from a conversation held by India Today's Associate Copy Editor Ninendra Saini: While signing Ashiki-2, it was expected that the film would be such a big hit? At that time it was known that the script is good but did not think much about such success
 shooting karte samay positive feeling aa rahi thi
 What was liked in the script of Aashiqui-2? Rahul Jayakar's role was challenging
 kairactor thodaa complex tha to mujhe laga karnaa chalanging hoga
 Then having a director like Mohit Suri also gives strength to the script
 ab film safal ho chuki he, to phans se kis tarah kaa risplens mil rahaa he?akasar mai trephic se bachane ke liye bike kaa istemaal karata hum
 Nowadays whenever i get off the bike, two or three bikes surround me and start talking about the film or its song
 ab aage bhi solo filmein karenge?bilkul
 But i also have to do good films with it
 bataur ek actor gro karnaa he
 What do you take special care of when choosing a script? Good story and director because the film releases in a day but its shooting takes up to six months
 isliye vah chah maheene masti main kaam karte hue guzarane chahie
 What kind of support does your two brothers (siddharth Roy Kapur and Kunal Roy Kapur) and sister-in-law (vidya Balan) get when choosing a film? Of course everyone gives their opinion
 lekin aakhri faisla meraa apana hi hota he

 vidya baalan ne aashiqui-2 dekhne ke baad aapaki kaaphi tarif kii thi, aapako kaisaa laga?vah pal mere liye kaaphi khaas tha kyonki meraa puraa parivaar yah film dekhne aayaa tha
 After the end of the film, the emotions i saw on everyone's face were the most important for me
 aapaki aane vaali filmein?philhal to yah javaani he divaani hi aa rahi he
 The rest of the films are still being talked about, nothing has been finalized
 'best' kaa akalan he ki sarkaar kii ranneeti kaaphi had tak kargar rahi he lekin mugalate main rahane kii gunjaaish nahin he
 For this, Home Minister P
 chidambaram badhai ke paatr hai, lekin khatra bana hua he or bade vyavasthaagat badlaav karne kii zarurat he
 "" Arun Puri, editor-in-chief, India Today: After 26 / 11, the Board of Experts on Security and Terror (BEST) was formed in March 2009 as part of India Today's 'war against Terror' campaign and that's when our The first meeting was held
 iske peeche vichaar yah tha ki pathakon ko suraksha or aatank par visheshgyon kii raay or inase nibatane ke liye kiye ja sakane vaale upayon ke bare main bataaya ja sake
 Our focus is on cross-border terror and as far as terrorist attacks are concerned, there has been no major incident in the last 11 months
 kya yah hamaari khushkismati he yaa phir sarkaar ne kuch kiya he? is bich, suraksha or aatank se jude duusare mudde ubhar aae hai
 Naxalite terror is now at the top of the national agenda and we want to know from you how the government should deal with it
 jaahir he, ham hameshaa pakistan ko doshi nahin tehra sakate, jo apni hi aantarik samasyaon se ghira hua he lekin bharat ke saath vah jo kuch karata rahaa he us par use koi pachhtaawaa nahin he or ab bhi vah apni jid par ada hua he
 Apart from all this, there is tension with China
 ham aapse jaananaa chaahate hai ki china se bharat kaise nibat rahaa he or is maamle main kya karne kii jarurat he
 Raj Chengappa, Managing Editor, India Today: The best assessment in the March was that the government had failed completely to deal with the terrorist threat after 26 / 11
 thik ek maheene baad 26 / 11 kii barsi he or hamen akalan karne kii jarurat he ki hamane is disha main kya pragati kii he
 Has there been any change or is it our good luck that there was no major terrorist attack from across the border as Arun said? Ved Marwah, former Governor, Jharkhand: Many factors behind the failure of any major event after 26 / 11 Has worked iskaa kuch shrey sarkaar ko jaataa he or kuch pakistan kii ghatnaon ko jaataa he, jahaan jihadi apana vajood bachaae rakhane ke liye jaddojahad kar rahe hai; bharat or jammu-kashmir ab unke agenda main sabase upar nahin hai
 If the Pakistani army wins, then we will have trouble and if the jihadis win, then obviously we will have even more trouble

 Chidambaram's elevation as home minister has helped instill a sense of preparedness among security agencies — intelligence agencies, state police and paramilitary forces
 kuch vidhaayi upaay kiye gaye hai, avaidh gatividhi nirodhak adhinium banaakar kanoon ko sakht bana diya gaya he or ek jaanch agency kaa gathan kar diya gaya he
 But the government should not live in Mughalate
 khatra ab bhi bana hua he or jaise hi hamaare pados main halaat saamaanya honge, jihadi hamen pramukh nishaanaa maan lenge
 Their web is present there, it has not been identified and eliminated
 sahi mauka aane par use sakriy kiya ja saktaa he
 For this, the government still needs to take many measures
 un upayon main ek yah he ki sarkaar rashtriya aatank virdohi agency ko desh or duniya kii ghatnaon par najar rakhane kaa adhikaar de
 He should analyze every incident and take measures to make his preparation strong
 hamen ek aise vyapak kanoon kii jarurat he jise jaanch agenciyaan, abhiyojan paksh or adaalatein samaj saken
 All political parties should form a national consensus and should not attempt to take political advantage of terrorist incidents
 satish nambiar, purv up senadhyaksh:pichley saal hamane shuruyaat is aadhaar par kii thi ki hamen rokthaam par dhyaan dena chahie
 i have been paying special attention to this for some time and it is important
 ab lagbhag ek saal hone ko he or hamaare yahaan koi bada haadasa nahin hua he
 Therefore, we should give credit to the government
 main yah bhi chahta hum ki ehtiyaati ranneeti taiyaar kii jaae or jihadi samoohon se sambandh rakhane vaale aatankwaadiyon par ehtiyaati hamale bolne kii kshamta viksit kii jaae
 This means that we have to find out their whereabouts and find out where their leader lives
 agar hamane aisa nahin kiya he to yah gambhir maamla he
 The Air Force has the capability to carry out precise attacks
 hamen is kshamta ko viksit karne par dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie kyonki ham haadason kaa intjaar nahin kar sakate
 We should do everything we can to avoid terrorist attacks
 brahm chellani, professor, ranneetik adhyayan, centre for policy stadiapichley 11 maheene se koi aatanki hamalaa nahin hua lekin iskaa yah matlab nahin he ki aakhri hamale ke baad bharat main aatanki hamalon kaa khatra kam ho gaya he
 The threat level from terrorist attacks is same as before but are we more prepared than before? Yes, we are more prepared than ever at the level of government response, not institutionally
 isse yah jaahir hota he ki agar aap kisi peshewar ko kisi mantralay kaa prabharee bana den to vah badlaav laa saktaa he
 Ever since Chidambaram became the Home Minister, there has been a deliberate attempt to change India's internal security policy
 unhone shuruyaat shunya se kii thi or aaj unhen maaloom rahata he ki vastav main kya chal rahaa he
 Apart from this, they have kept the pressure on everyone
 har subah ve vibhinn agenciyon ke pramukhon or rashtriya suraksh salaahkaar (enese) ke saath baithak karte hai
 So, for the first time coordination is taking place at senior level
 pradhanmantri ne unhen khuli chhot de rakhi he or grih mantralay kii nitiyon ko lagu karne ke maamle main katai hastkshe nahin karte or isi vajah se aapako bharat kii aantarik suraksha niti ke prabandhan main amulchul parivartan najar aa rahaa he
 For the last three and a half years, i have heard the Prime Minister repeatedly saying that Naxalism is the biggest threat to India's security, but no action was taken to deal with it
 maano khatre kaa sanket de dena hi paryaapt he
 But now we are seeing at least one attempt, if not a strategy, to deal with sudden Naxal violence
 yah sab nijee str par kiya ja rahaa he
 What if that person is not at that place, then we will reach the same place where it was a year ago
 yah mahatvapurn he ki pichley 11 maheenon ke dauraan koi bada aatanki hamalaa nahin hua kyonki hamane yah tay kar diya he ki 26 / 11 ko na bhulaayaa jaae
 Even though we know that Pakistan will do nothing in this matter, but we have adopted a policy of handing them dossiers to keep pressure on them
 shuru main mujhe dosier banaakar use aatankwaad ke praayojak ko saunpane kii samaj par andeh tha
 So far we have seen that these dossiers have kept them unbalanced and they keep reminding Pakistan that relations with India will not be normal until it takes action against the leaders of 26 / 11
 isse pehle sarkaar ne kuch maheene se zyada ek hi ranneeti par tike rahane kii ichhashakti kaa pradarshan nahin kiya tha
 In Sharm el-sheikh, there was a reversal of this strategy
 lekin phir peeche hat gaye
 In a way, a clear message has been given to Pakistan that it is his responsibility
 ajit kumaar dobhaal, purv nideshak, khufia beuro (ibi):jab aap yah kehete hai ki ''kya bharat aatanki hamalon se nibatane ke liye pehle se zyada taiyaar he?'' to aatanki khataron ko do kshetron main dekhne kii jarurat hoti he
 First, Pakistan and terrorist groups exist; And second, is the response that the Government of India gives to its ability to take precautionary action to prevent and punish them
 aatank kaa str kam ho gaya he-kuch had tak pakistan ke bheetar chal rahi ghatnaon kii vajah se, kuch had tak pakistan par kootnithik dabaav kii vajah se, kuch had tak is vajah se ki bharat ne acha kootnithik prayaas kiya he-dabaav banaae rakhane ke liye apane pattey khele hai, use durust kiya he or use thande baste main nahin jane diya he
 Pakistan has realized that any covert action may have to pay an unacceptable price
 aisa laga ki ve iskaa akalan kar rahe hai, jaisaa ki pakistan ke purv rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar major general mahmud ali durrani ke haal ke daure se jaahir hota he
 Institutional changes have not taken place on a large scale except to form organizations for investigation
 chidambaram halaat durust karne main safal rahe hai
 It is not that any new capacity has been developed but the existing capacity is being fully exploited
 khufia sevaayen sakriy hokar mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa sakati hai
 Our intelligence services are also doing better and now they are more effective than ever

 Former High Commissioner of India to Parthasarathy, Pakistan: India's ability to influence Pakistan's real policy controllers is limited
 pakistani fouj ke saath aapke sambandh simit hai
 The Pakistani military is dominated by only the US, China and Saudi Arabia
 ab aisa lagata he ki saudi arab bhi vahi kar rahaa he jo america chahta he
 i think the Pakistani attempt to include Kashmir in the whole terrorist equation of afghanistan-pakistan has been neatly thwarted
 lihaaja, sara dhyaan afghanistan-pakistan par hi he
 The second thing is that we have been able to work in this system and have made some provisions in the kerry-lugar Act
 is act main, pakistan ko milane vaali sahaayta ke liye pehali baar shart rakhi gai he or seemaa paar aatankwaad rokane kaa praavdhaan he
 This is a deliberate effort and credit must be given to the Embassy and the Ambassador
 ham ek paksh ko prabhavit karne main sakasham rahe hai, lekin ham shuruaati dabaav se bhi baahar aa gaye hai
 We have to find at least some other mechanism to deal with ISI
 is par bahes ho sakati he ki unke saath khufia jaankaree saajha kii jaae yaa nahin, lekin hamen yah ekadam spasht kar dena chahie ki unhen kya nahin karnaa chahie or aatanki dhaanche se hamaara taatpary kya he
 It is to be seen how this will work
 pakistan ne apni pashchimi seemaa par sari takat jhenk di he or agar usne galati doharaai yaa phir 26 / 11 jaisi kisi ghatana ko dohraane kii jurrat kii to use mahangi keemat chukaani hogi
 This message has become clear mainly because the terror attack affected the citizens of many countries, most of all the Israelites also had to bear the brunt of it
 yah mumbai cond kaa nateeja tha
 India took advantage of this, and in fact, it did many things that the predecessor government had been doing, such as whining about being a victim of Pakistani terrorism, joint action against terrorism, etc
 agar sarkaar pakistan ke maamle main apana ravaiya badalakar use yah bataa de ki use apni harakat kii keemat chukaani hogi, or yah ki aatankwaad ke dhaanche se uskaa kya matlab he, to yah kargar hoga
 Pakistan's condition is very critical and i think its army will be in trouble in Waziristan

 isi vajah se hamen kisi bhi haalat main apni suraksha vyavastha ko kam nahin hone dena chahie
 Chidambaram has changed the environment of the government and the government's vision towards terrorism
 lekin china ke maamle main sarkaar duusari disha main chali gai he
 Immediately after Mumbai he welcomed Pakistan's Joint Chiefs of Staff General Tariq Majeed and conferred with him from all over the world
 saudi arab ne orgenigeshan of da islamic conference main kashmir par vot daalane ke alaava khamoshi odh rakhi he
 Kapil Kak, Additional Director, Center for Air Power Studies: We are congratulating ourselves if nothing happens in the last 11 months
 ise duusare nazariye se dekhie
 Nothing has happened because Pakistan is entangled on its western border
 26 / 11 ke baad jammu-kashmir main ghuspaith bahut kam ho gai he
 It has decreased from 13 per day to less than one
 chidambaram ke padbhaar grahan karne ke baad se taiyaari kaa str bad gaya he lekin hamen kaaphi kuch karne kii jarurat he
 If there is an air attack, which is feared and which has been discussed, we are not ready to deal with it in the south
 us ilaake main hawaii ghuspaith kaa pataa lagane ke liye koi radar nahin he
 Nothing special can be done unless we prepare a ground like Homeland Security to prevent terrorist attacks
 khufia jaankaree jutaney ke maamle main kaaphi sudhaar hua he lekin mujhe pakkaa yakeen nahin he ki akalan ke maamle main koi sudhaar hua he
 For any future system, the situation in the matter of dealing with terrorism will be important in the present and the next 10-15 years
 mujhe lagata he ki 26 / 11 ke baad sainya vikalp ko na apana kar bahut sujh-boojh kaa parichay diya gaya
 We have seen immense benefits of this philosophy
 haa, hamaare paas sateek hamalaa karne kii kshamta he or ise puri dakshata ke saath behatar banaaya gaya he tathaa sateek dand dene main ham sakasham hai
 But we also need to keep in our equation that Pakistan will not miss any attack or attack

 Kiran Bedi, former DG, Bureau of Police Research and Development: We have more than a million policemen
 mujhe maaloom nahin he ki unke prashikshan, kalyaan yaa carmik niti kaa koi akalan kiya gaya he yaa nahin
 We do not make any investment and i do not see any unbiased assessment by the police about the functioning of the police and its impact on us
 asli khufiagiri, aatank se nibatane ke liye sabase jaruri kaam paidal sipaahi karte hai
 i do not think Chidambaram has been able to reach the soldiers on foot
 chidambaram abhi tak kendriya police sanghathanon (sipio) tak pahunche hai
 They have met the IB chief and the NSA, but why have they not met the police chiefs of the states? BSF and CRPF should be included in their meeting and other cpos should also be involved
 mujhe nahin lagata ki pratikriya sachmuch sudhaar vaali he
 They are still reactionary
 main chaahati hum ki chidambaram netritv kaa vikaas karen
 i don't think they are doing this
 mujhe unamem adheeratha najar nahin aati
 We should hurry to become a good leader
 agar chidambaram yah kehete hai ki police rajya kaa vishay he to yah mujhe sweekaarya nahin he kyonki ve netritv kaa vikaas kar sakate hai
 Perhaps we are expecting more from them

 Today, even though our situation has improved, we should not be satisfied

 Ajay Sahni, Executive Director, Center for Conflict Studies: i agree with Kiran's opinion

 The basic thing is that our aspirations are very high

 India is the only country in the world where people start worshiping to do their work

 While intelligence is important in some areas, central agencies have been prepared to launch an effort to coordinate with state agencies
 kya hamaari taiyaari behatar he? chidambaram kaa jawaab tha, ''ham utane hi kamjor hai jitne 26 / 11 ko the
 "it would be better if he becomes the Home Minister not just of the Center but of the whole country
" yah kaam unka nahin he
 They cannot run a police station at a lower level

 Consider the training of police forces: Only after 13 weeks of training, new recruits are included in the special operations squads
 chidambaram acha kaam kar rahe hai lekin bharat ko bachaane kii sari jimmedaari unheen kii nahin he
 The rest of the system is still stagnant and there is a huge shortfall in total capacity and their rate of recovery is so slow that challenges will soon be overshadowed by Chidambaram's efforts
 aap 11 maheene tak kisi badi ghatana ke na hone par jashn manaa sakate hai lekin iskaa hamaari kisi bhi pratikriya se koi sarokaar nahin he; ham jitne bade khatre se rou-ba-rou hai, usase nibatane ke liye hamaare paas sansaadhan nahin hai

 Does the commander posted in that metropolis have the right to leave his commandos at the time when the state police chief tells him?

 aam aadmi party (AAP) ne asantusht netaonprashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav ko party virdohi gatividhiyon ke liye shuukravaar ko kaaran bataao notice bheja
 Reacting to this, Yogendra Yadav called it a joke

 Through this notice, the last step has been taken to remove the two leaders from the party
 vahiin yadav ne is kadam par sawaal khadaa karte hue kaha ki yah prakritik nyaay ke siddhant ke khilaaf he
 Yogendra Yadav wrote in his Facebook post- 'I saw on TV channels that party leaders (who are not even members of the disciplinary committee) have sent us a show cause notice

 Posted byyogendra yadavonfriday, April 17, 2015 Earlier on Friday, AAP spokesperson Deepak Bajpai had said that separate notices were sent to Yadav, Bhushan, Anand Kumar and Ajit Jha and sent a 'proof' of charges against them
 unhone kaha, ‘unase do din main jawaab dene ko kaha gaya he
 We have mailed them and also handed over the copy by hand
 ’ haalanki asantusht netaaon ne daawa kiya ki unhen abhi notice nahin mila he
 After the 'swaraj Samvad' was organized by the unsatisfied leaders, the party referred their cases to the National Discipline Committee

 However, the court rejected their petition and upheld the ban on companies wearing hijab
 in mahilaon ko companiyon ne hijaab pahanane se manaa karne par naukari se nikaal diya tha
 The Belgian petitioner was employed as a receptionist at G4S Secure Solutions, a female employee, while the woman from France is an IT consultant
 yachikakarta mahilaon ne daleel di thi ki hijaab pahanane par pratibandh dharmik swatantraaa kaa hanan he, lekin adaalat ne ise khaarij kar diya
 Indeed, G4S formally banned the wearing of hijab in 2006, but when female employees did not stop wearing the hijab, the company allowed it to become law
 vahiin, france kii company ne graahakon kii shikaayat par mahila karmchaaree ke hijaab pahanane par roak laga di thi
 Even after this, the Muslim women were fired for not believing

 It states that the security forces are the guards of the country's borders, region and the entire political system
 loktantr main unki bhoomika nishpaksh or gaiyr raajnneetik he
 For this reason, it is important that political parties and politicians should be careful while referring to the security forces in the election campaign

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne kaha he ki pehle unhen lagata tha ki narendra modi eemaandaar hai lekin ab unki eemaandaaree par shaq hone laga he
 In the Agenda Aaj Tak, in conversation with Rajdeep Sardesai, Kejriwal lashed out at the BJP and the Modi government at the Center
 notebandi ke masale par centre sarkaar ko nishane par liya
 He challenged an inquiry into his allegations
 kejariwal ne kaha, 'notebandi 8 lakh karod kaa ghotaalaa he, yah main deshbhar kii janata ko bataaunga
 Friends of Modi's businessmen have taken 8 lakh crores rupees from banks
 in logon ke paise maaf karne ke liye notebandi lagu kii gai
 When Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, who was present in the visitors' gallery during the program, was consulted on these allegations of Kejriwal, he termed the allegations of the CM of Delhi as baseless
 unhone kaha ki yah 8 lakh karod kaa ghotaalaa kahaan hai, paise to desh kii bainkon main jamaa hai
 On this question, what is the reason why you get angry on hearing of demonetisation and Narendra Modi's name
 kejariwal ne kaha, 'mujhe gussa nahin aata
 The people of the country get angry
 notebandi ke chalate 84 logon kii maut ho chuki he
 On 8 November, the PM gave four major reasons for demonetisation

 kejariwal ne kaha, 'notebandi ke naam par janata ko murkh banaaya ja rahaa he

 If black money and corruption were to be stopped, then two or four corrupt leaders should have been jailed

 baba ramdev ''thag'' he
 The BJP is a party of "nachhanis"
 apni phisalati jabaan kii vajah se lagaataar majaak kaa paatr ban rahe congress ke mahasachiv digvijay singh khud apane bare main kya kehete hai? abhi haal hi main unhone media se kaha, ''main jab-tab dagane vaali top hum
 "this is perhaps the third most favorable of these three observations
" kisi samay parishkar or najaakat kaa saakshaat pratik maane jane vaale, kabir ke dohon ke vaise hi jaankaar, jitne apple ke imac se waakif, digvijay singh ab sarkaar main apane sahyogiyon ke liye sharmindagi kaa sabab ban gaye hai
 It was too heavy for Kapil Sibal to explain why four cabinet ministers were running to impress a man whom one of his colleagues termed as a thug
 digvijay ne ramdev se airport par milane jane kii khullamakhulla aalochana karke sarkaar kii musiibat or badha di
 Earlier, the party had not expressed its displeasure about this, although there were reports that Madam (sonia Gandhi) was unhappy with the Prime Minister's decision to send senior ministers to the airport
 duusare log jahaan kaanaafoosee karte hai, digvijay dhadlle se bolte hai
 Digvijay said in a TV interview, "I would not talk to Ramdev
 mujhe bahut bura laga ki pranab da (mukherjee) unase milane airport gaye
 He is the senior-most cabinet minister, a Union minister since Baba Ramdev was not even born
 unhone apana rajnatik kariyar daanv par laga diya or baba ramdev ko sarkaar kii sthiti ke bare main samajhane ke liye chale gaye
 "however, Digvijay also defended the conversation later," If we had not spoken to him, everyone would have said that it is such a practice that does not even want to talk about corruption
 kam-se-kam hamane apni taraf se unhen samajhane kii puri koshish kii ki unki maangen kitni ayathartwaadee hai
 "now the party is also following the path of Digvijay about Ramdev, of course the language of the party is not of his level
 ramdev ke saath manch par kattar hindu netri sadhvi rutambhraa vaala drishy congress netaaon ke gale nahin utar rahaa
 It is a very unique moment that Digvijay and Home Minister P
K
 chidambaram donon ekamat hai
 Chidambaram said, "ramdev has been raised by RSS
 ''iraadaa yah he ki kaaryakartaaon ke bich foot daalane ke liye ramdev ko anna hajaare se alag sabit kiya jaae
 Digvijaya says, "anna is different from Ramdev
 ve gandhivadi hai
 "the Congress has learned the art of speaking different languages, especially when one of its government's stakes backfires
" digvijay kii bhashaa darasal unke malikan kii bhashaa he
 They cannot speak like this without the recitation of Sonia Gandhi
 unhen rahul gandhi kaa pramukh maardarshak mana jaataa he
 Digvijay claims that he was never asked to shut his mouth
 unhone india today se kaha, ''yahaan tak ki kabhi kisi ne mujhse koi safai bhi nahin maangi
 "it is very difficult to trust his point of proving himself clean
" ve kehete hai, ''meraa kisi vivaad main padane kaa iraadaa nahin he
 i just speak about the facts, tell the truth
 ''do baar madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri rahe digvijay ke kandhon par ab rahul ke sabase pasandida project kaa kaarybhaar he-congress ke liye uttar pradesh phir jeetna
 Both are known as Raja and Yuvraj in the corridors of Congress
 lekin jahaan rahul ahm rashtriya muddon par mushkil se hi jabaan kholte hai, vahiin digvijay bahut zyada bolkar bharpai kar dete hai
 When Digvijay crosses too many boundaries, the high command avoids his controversial remarks
 pichley saal unki azamgarh yatra main aisa hua, jab unhone bottla house muthbhed ke bare main sawaal uthaaya tha
 It was most appropriate for the Congress that she was speaking in one voice in Delhi and her voice changed when the question of the Muslim vote bank of eastern Uttar Pradesh came up
 jo bhi ho, digvijay singh uttar pradesh ke musalamaanon ke liye kuch zyada hi muhabbat jataane kii keemat chukaa rahe hai
 They are losing credibility
 osama bin laden ko samudr main dafnaae jane ko lekar unki haal kii tippaniyon ko hi lijie
 In response to a question, he said that a criminal is also entitled to be cremated according to his religious beliefs
 ek cabinet mantri ne kaha, ''digvijay singh ke saath dikkat yah he ki jab unase poocha jaataa he ki 'kya aapane apni patni kii pitari karnaa band kar diya' to ve is sawaal kaa bhi jawaab dene lagate hai
 "digvijay Singh insists that his comment" was taken "from Ladakh"
 ve kehete hai, ''main use is tarah kyon sambodhit karuunga? maine kabhi uskaa gungan nahin kiya
 i am the only person who made a statement against Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Imam Bukhari, who organized a condolence meeting for Laden
 maine muslim kattarta ke khilaaf jitna sangharsh kiya, utana hi hindu kattarta ke khilaaf bhi kiya he
 The tragedy with Digvijay Singh is that he called Osama ji Laden ji, it is easier to believe that than he was speaking in a sarcastic tone
 ve kathorta se kehete hai, '''digvijay singh ke vichaaron ko lekar aapane galatfahami paal lee he
 Digvijay Singh is a staunch Congressman who believes in liberal Gandhian ideology and wants to fight against every facade of fundamentalism
 ''yah thakur netaa aksar kahata he ki siyaayat sambhaavnaaon kii kala he
 In this vote bank politics, Congressmen see the aggressive statements of Digvijay as an art of reinvigorating himself like his late mentor
 madhya pradesh ke duusare thakur arjuna singh ne aisa hi badal karne kii koshish kii thi
 It would be better for Digvijay Singh to remember what Sitaram Kesari once said about Arjun Singh, "his mind is such that if you put a nail in it, it will come out as a screw
" '' digvijay singh kaa nishaanaa spasht he
 The Congress does not have a reliable Muslim leader with a broad support base, especially in Uttar Pradesh
 lekin ve thakur vot ko kyon darkinar kar rahe hai, jo swaabhaavik rup se unke saath aa saktaa he? amar singh to thakur vot bank ko saadhane ke liye puri party bana chuke hai or mayawati kii sarkaar main aath mantri thakur hai
 Digvijay Singh says, "I am not a racist, i am a Congressman
" ''lekin apni siyasat kii vyakhya karte hue ve kehete hai ki ve ''jamini str par sangharsh karne vaale'' netaa bhi hai
 "we are all active activists of the Congress, not top leaders
 '' beshak digvijay isse kahin behatar kar sakate hai
 Once they have done it
 samay purv aam chunaav kii sambhaavna ko khaarij nahin karte hue uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki congress samet sabhi dal loksabhaa chunaav ke liye taiyaar hai
 When Akhilesh was asked if he saw the possibility of a premature general election, he said, 'look, all parties are ready
 or jab main akhabaaron main vigyaapan dekhtaa hum to main mahasoos karata hum ki yahaan tak ki congress bhi (aam chunaav ke liye) taiyaar he
 Asked about his Samajwadi Party (SP) staying away from dinner on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the UPA-2 government, he said, "we attended the banquet once and the second time it was canceled

 The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh was addressing a press conference after inaugurating the Uttar Pradesh Bhavan in Navi Mumbai
 jab unase poocha gaya ki kya congress or sapa ke bich sambandh ab pehle jaise nahin rahe, to unhone kaha, ‘upie ko hamaara samarthan keval sampradayik takaton ko dur rakhane ke liye he
 'akhilesh said,' But we have kept our views on issues like corruption and inflation
 ham samaajawaadee log kabhi congress kii nitiyon se sahamat nahin rahe lekin jab sampradayik takaton se nibatane kaa sawaal aata he tab ham congress kaa samarthan karte hai
 'he said,' Whether the national executive of our party and Netaji (mulayam) will decide on the issue of whether the support will continue
 ’ tisare morche ke vishay par akhilesh ne kaha, ‘jahaan kabhi bhi gaiyr congress sarkarein hai, unke mukhyamantri yah sunishchit karne kaa prayaas karenge ki loksabhaa ke liye unki party ke adhiktam sadsy chune jaaen, chaahe vah tamilnadu ho, yaa pashchim bengal, yaa oreisha, yaa uttar pradesh yaa bihar
 Therefore, no one can rule out this possibility
 sabase badi baat raajnneeti kii aadhaar sthiti or sankhyabal he
 Akhilesh said that his priority is to strengthen SP in other areas especially Mumbai and Maharashtra

 Senior players like Brian Lara, Sanath Jayasuriya, Adam Gilchrist and Sourav Ganguly, who have carved a niche for fans with their spectacular performances, will be eyeing the Indian Premier League (IPL) players' auction to see which franchises are betting on them
 Is applying yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki kya frenchiji ab bhi in cricketron ko khel ke sabase chote praaroop main behatar samajhati hai
 It is a coincidence that all four of these senior players are left-handed batsmen and barring Jayasuriya, the other three are placed in the highest base price category of $ 4 lakh
 jayasoorya ko do lakh dollars aadhaar mulya vaale varg main rakhaa gaya he
 Brian Lara, aged 41 and eight months, will be the oldest player in the IPL auction followed by Sanath Jayasuriya (41 years and six months)
 safal wicketiper ballebaaj gilcrist (39 saal or do maheene) is suchi main tisare or purv bhartiya captain ganguli (38 saal or chah maheene) chauthe number par hai
 Among these four, Lara and Ganguly can be the center of attraction among the franchisees
 mana ja rahaa he ki ganguli ke liye mumbai indiens, sahaara pune varirs or kolkata nite rides boli laga sakate hai
 Whether or not the cinema houses will be 'housefull' this week, this week's release 'housefull 3', which has already had two successful sequels, the last two 'housefull' was directed by Sajid Khan, but 'housefull-3' 'is directed by sajid-farhad and is written by the same pair
 yah film ek multistarar film he, jahaan aapako mukhya bhoomikaaon main nazar aaenge akshay kumaar, abhishek bachchan, ritesh deshmukh, jaiki shrof, baman irani, jacleen farnandis, lija heden, nargis fakari or chanki pande
 The story of the film is somewhat similar to that in 'housefull 2', that is, 3 boys who want to marry rich girls, whereas in 'housefull 2', the fathers of girls are looking for rich boys and then Joe You can guess the same thing happens in the film
 matlab apni pahchaan chupa kar kuch or dikhaanaa, phir villen kaa aana, maar khaanaa or chit ho janaa
 
 
 So there is not much to tell in the story
 'housephul 3' ek slapstick kamedi he yani bhaag daud, girnaa padana, aade tirchhe chehre bananaa vagahara-vagahara jahaan van liners hai, chutakle hai or aise kirdaar hai, jo shaayad aapako hansaa paaen
 Before explaining how 'housefull 3' is, i would like to put some thoughts about comedy, the first thing is comedy is a relatable thing that is interrelated where someone can laugh at something and not someone, many times We laugh at the way someone speaks, but no one smiles at him
 to kisa bhi kamedi ke liye aap khud behatar nirnay le sakate hai ki kamedi acchhee he yaa buree, yah dekhakar kii aapako hansi ai yaa nahin
 Now there is a Bari review, where i will tell you whether or not i laughed after watching this film and how i felt 'housefull 3' and that too with the features and flaws, in which the first thing was the flaws
 pehali baat kahani main koi nayaapan nazar nahin aata
 At the beginning of the film, the characters of the three heroes are introduced to Narration, which seems long and boring
 saath hi mujhe laga kii iskaa or behatar tarika ho saktaa tha, madhyantar se pehle mujhe film ke kuch hisson main hansi kam muskuraahat zyaada mahasoos hui, saath hi mujhe laga kii tarah-tarah ke sound effectus kaa istemaal karke mujhe bataaya ja rahaa he ki mujhe yahaan hansanaa he
 In this part of the film, i could not see the edge of both editing and dialogues less sharp
 film main kamedi ke maamle main teenon ladkiyaan kamazor nazar ain
 In the film, these three literally translate English, which is part of their character, but this method of laughing does not work
 
 
 to yah tha khanmiyaan
 The comments ab baat karte kuubiyon kii
 
 
 The life of this film is Akshay Kumar and Ritesh Deshmukh, both perfect comic timing and acting that will tickle you, there are many scenes of the film, which will make you laugh and the dialogues, situations and acting are all three
 khaastaur par madhyantar ke baad, film kaa sangeet acha he or iske do gane 'pyaar kii ' or 'fek isk mujhe acha laga
 
 
 '
 'fek ishk' ke acha lagane kaa kaaran iskaa filmakan jo ki isaki kahani ke saath bhi jaataa he or aapako hansaata bhi he
 i liked the way the characters of the three heroes were created, such as Akshay's split personality, Ritesh's tongue slipping and Abhishek as a frustrated rapper who will make you laugh many times, Baman is also chic, but he has an advice from his characters
 Do not repeat too much
 to yah thi 'houseful-3' ke bare main meri roy, baaki jaisaa maine kaha ki kamedi ke behatar jaj aap khud hai, kyonki yah main nahin bataa saktaa ki ek khaas paristhiti, khaas insaan yaa khaas chutakle ko sunakar aapako kitni hansi aegi yaa aegi bhi yaa nahin, par mujhe yah film dekhte vakt hansi ai isliye meri taraf se ise 3 stars
 The film is a multistarrer film where you will see Akshay Kumar, Abhishek Bachchan, Ritesh Deshmukh, Jackie Shroff, Baman Irani, Jacqueline Fernandes, Lisa Haydon, Nargis Fakri and Chunky Pandey in the lead roles
 film kii kahani kuch kuch waisi hi he jaisi kii 'houseful-2' main thi, yani 3 ladke jo amir ladakiyon se shaadi karnaa chaahate hai, vahiin 'houseful-2' main ladakiyon ke pita amir ladke dhund rahe hote hai or phir jo jo aap andaaza laga sakate hai film main vahi hota he
 Means to show something else by hiding your identity, then the arrival of the villain, killing and becoming sick
 
 
 to kahani main bataane ko zyada kuch nahin he
 'housefull 3' is a slapstick comedy, ie running, falling, making cross faces diagonally, where there are one liners, there are jokes and characters that might make you laugh
 'housephul 3' kisi he, yah bataane se pehle kamedi ke bare main main apane kuch vichaar rakhana chaahunga, pehali baat kamedi ek relitive chiz he yani paraspar sambadhit he jahaan kisi ko kisi baat par hansi aa sakati he or kisi ko nahin, kai baar hamen kisi ke bolne ke andaaz par hi hansi aa jaati he, par koi us par muskuraataa bhi nahin he
 So for any comedy, you can take a better decision yourself whether the comedy is good or bad, see if you made me laugh or not
 ab baari rivyuu kii he, jahaan main aapako bataaunga kii yah film dekhakar mujhe hansi ai yaa nahin or mujhe kisi lagi 'housephul 3' or wo bhi kuubiyon or kaamiyon ke saath, jisamen sabase pehle baat kaamiyon kii
 First of all, there is no newness in the story
 is film ke shuruyaat main teenon nayakon ke kirdaaron kaa parichay naireshan ke saath diya jaataa he, jo kii lanbaa or ubaau lagata he
 At the same time i felt that there could have been a better way to do this, before the intermission i felt more laughs and less smiles in some parts of the film, as well as i felt that i was being told to use different types of sound effects
 Laugh here
 film ke is bhaag main mujhe editing or dialogs donon kii hi dhar kam tej nazar nahin ai
 The three girls appeared to be weak in terms of comedy in the film
 film main yah teenon angrezi kaa shabdic anuwaad karti hai, jo ki inke kirdaar kaa hissaa he par hansaane kaa ye tarika kaam nahin karata
 
 
 So this was the poop
 tippaniyan Now talking about things 
 
 is film kii jaan hai akshay kumaar or ritesh deshmukh, donon kii parfect comic timming or abhinay jo aapako gudgudaayenge, film kii bahut saare drishy hai, jo aapako hansane par majaboor karenge or isamen dialogs, paristhiti or abhinay teenon kaa hi haath he
 Especially after the intermission, the music of the film is good and its two songs' Pyaar ki 'and' Phek isk i liked
 
 
 '
 The reason for 'fake Ishq' looks good is its filming which also goes with its story and makes you laugh
 jis tarah se teenon hero ke kirdaar gadhe gaye wo mujhe acha laga masalan akshay kii split personality, ritesh kaa jubaan fisalna or abhishek ek kunthit raper ke kirdaar main jo aapako kai baar hansaa jaanege, baman bhi thaak hai, par unhen ek salaah apane kirdaaron kaa zyada na doharaaen
 So this was my Roy about 'housefull 3', the rest as i said that you are a better judge of comedy, because i cannot tell how much laugh you will get by listening to a particular situation, a particular person or a special jokes or Whether it will come or not, but i got a laugh while watching this film, so 3 stars from my side
 matlab apni pahchaan chupa kar kuch or dikhaanaa, phir villen kaa aana, maar khaanaa or chit ho janaa
 
 
 So there is not much to tell in the story
 'housephul 3' ek slapstick kamedi he yani bhaag daud, girnaa padana, aade tirchhe chehre bananaa vagahara-vagahara jahaan van liners hai, chutakle hai or aise kirdaar hai, jo shaayad aapako hansaa paaen

 Do not repeat too much
 to yah thi 'houseful-3' ke bare main meri roy, baaki jaisaa maine kaha ki kamedi ke behatar jaj aap khud hai, kyonki yah main nahin bataa saktaa ki ek khaas paristhiti, khaas insaan yaa khaas chutakle ko sunakar aapako kitni hansi aegi yaa aegi bhi yaa nahin, par mujhe yah film dekhte vakt hansi ai isliye meri taraf se ise 3 stars
 Before explaining how 'housefull 3' is, i would like to put some thoughts about comedy, the first thing is comedy is a relatable thing that is interrelated where someone can laugh at something and not someone, many times We laugh at the way someone speaks, but no one smiles at him
 to kisa bhi kamedi ke liye aap khud behatar nirnay le sakate hai ki kamedi acchhee he yaa buree, yah dekhakar kii aapako hansi ai yaa nahin
 Now there is a Bari review, where i will tell you whether or not i laughed after watching this film and how i felt 'housefull 3' and that too with the features and flaws, in which the first thing was the flaws
 pehali baat kahani main koi nayaapan nazar nahin aata
 At the beginning of the film, the characters of the three heroes are introduced to Narration, which seems long and boring
 saath hi mujhe laga kii iskaa or behatar tarika ho saktaa tha, madhyantar se pehle mujhe film ke kuch hisson main hansi kam muskuraahat zyaada mahasoos hui, saath hi mujhe laga kii tarah-tarah ke sound effectus kaa istemaal karke mujhe bataaya ja rahaa he ki mujhe yahaan hansanaa he
 In this part of the film, i could not see the edge of both editing and dialogues less sharp

 Now talking about things 
 
 is film kii jaan hai akshay kumaar or ritesh deshmukh, donon kii parfect comic timming or abhinay jo aapako gudgudaayenge, film kii bahut saare drishy hai, jo aapako hansane par majaboor karenge or isamen dialogs, paristhiti or abhinay teenon kaa hi haath he
 Especially after the intermission, the music of the film is good and its two songs' Pyaar ki 'and' Phek isk i liked

 The reason for 'fake Ishq' looks good is its filming which also goes with its story and makes you laugh

 So this was my Roy about 'housefull 3', the rest as i said that you are a better judge of comedy, because i cannot tell how much laugh you will get by listening to a particular situation, a particular person or a special jokes or Whether it will come or not, but i got a laugh while watching this film, so 3 stars from my side

 Before Diwali, the Modi government has given a big gift to the business world
 sarkaar kii ore se corporate inakam tex main katautee kar di gai he to vahiin minimum alternet tex se raahat di gai he
 Apart from this, big gifts have also been given to investors
 lekin sawaal he ki sarkaar ke in faislon kaa kya asar hoga
 Let's understand
 
 
 
 1
 corporate tex par rahatsarkaar kaa sabase bada elaan corporate tex ko lekar he
 At a press conference on Friday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that now domestic companies will be charged 22% income tax without any exemption
 vahiin isamen sarcharge or ses jodne ke baad company ko 25
 17% tax will have to be paid
 kise milegaa phayda?iskaa phayda desh kii un badi companiyon ko milegaa jo 30 fisadi ke corporate tex slab main aati hai
 Here, tell us that corporate tax is levied on the earnings of companies
 iske daayre main privet, limited yaa listed or bina list vaali sabhi tarah kii companiyon aati hai
 Corporate tax is considered an important part of the government's revenue
 baharhaal, sarkaar ke nae faisle ke baad rajasav par 1
 45 lakh crore is expected to be a burden
 2
 Relief on new investment The government has also given relief to domestic companies making new investments
 darasal, ab 1 oktober 2019 ke baad menuphaccharing company sthapit karne vaale kaarobaariyon ko 15 fisadi kii dar se inakam tex dena hoga
 Tax rate of 17 after all surcharges and cess charges
 10 fisadi ho jaaegi
 Currently, new investors have to pay tax at the rate of 25 per cent
 kise milegaa phayda?is faisle se modi sarkaar ke mek in india project ko boost milane kii ummid he
 It is believed that now businesses will focus on new companies
 vahiin sust pad chuki starop yojana ko bhi badhaava mil saktaa he
 In such a situation new employment will be created
 haalanki jo gharelu company apana production 31 march 2023 ke baad karegi, use sarkaar kii raahat kaa phayda nahin milegaa
 3
 MAT par raahat sarkaar ne minimum alternet tex (MAT) main raahat di he
 18 now existing companies
 5 fisadi kii bajaay 15 fisadi kii dar se mat dena hoga
 Actually, MAT is levied on companies that earn profits, but due to concessions, the tax liability on them is reduced
 vartmaan main munaafe par companiyon ko 18
 Mats have to be given up to 5%
 kise milegaa phayda?sarkaar ke is faisle se videshi companiyon main zyada utsaah dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 Actually, foreign companies are reluctant to invest more in India because of this tax
 agar videshi niveshkon kaa bhartiya bazaar kii ore rujhaan badhata he to modi sarkaar kaa 2025 tak 5 trillian dollar iconomi kaa target aasaani se hasil ho sakegaa
 4
 capital gens par rahatsarkaar ne share bazaar main nivesh karne vaale niveshkon ko raahat dete hue capital gens par se sarcharge hataane kaa elaan kiya he
 On July 5, foreign and domestic investors were jolted in the general budget
 inke share bazaar main nivesh par long turm capital gens sarcharge badha diya gaya tha
 Who will benefit? This decision of the government means that those who sell shares or invest in equity mutual funds will get relief
 darasal, koi niveshak jab share yaa mutual fund bechata he to use unit main munafa hota he
 This profit is called capital gain and on this the government levies surcharge
 capital gens tex kya hota he?yahaan bataa den ki capital gen 2 tarah ke hote hai- pehla long turm or doosraa short turm capital gen
 At present, the profit on the amount sold in less than 3 years is called the short term while the profit on the property sold after more than 3 years is called long term capital
 vahiin share ke maamle main long turm capital 1 saal se adhik ko mana jaataa he
 The surcharge on capital gains of the long term was increased in the general budget
 asar ye hua ki kam phaayde kii vajah se nae niveshak share kharidne se batch rahe the
 Due to this, the stock market reached its worst phase of 17 years in July
 5
 Relief on buyback: The government has also announced exemption from buyback tax on listed companies that announced share buybacks before 5 July 2019
 iskaa sabase adhik phayda un companiyon ko hoga jo share bybech karti hai
 What happens when a stock buyback company buys its own shares from investors, it is called buyback
 yah prakriya puri hone ke baad in sheyaron kaa vajood khatm ho jaataa he
 Usually, there is excess cash in the balance sheets of companies only when the emphasis is on buyback
 company ke paas bahut zyada nakadi kaa hona acha nahin mana jaataa he
 This leads to speculation that the company is unable to use its cash
 yahi vajah he ki bybech ke jariye company apane atirikt nakadi kaa istemaal karti he
 Social activist and supporters of Gandhian leader Anna Hazare celebrated his 74th birthday with great pomp on Wednesday
 anna haalanki lokapal vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar kar rahi sanyukt samiti kii baithak main shaamil hone ke liye nai dilli main thea
 Hazare's colleague Datta Awari said that events like tree plantations were organized on Anna's birthday
 ahmednagar jile main unke paitruk gaanv relegan siddhi main samarthakon ne bade utsaah ke saath unka janmdin manaaya
 Avery said that bhajan-kirtan was also organized on this occasion
 unhone kaha ki aamtaur par anna janmdin ke avasar par apane gaanv main hi hote hai magar is baar lokapal baithak ke kaaran vah yahaan nahin hai
 Avery said that he does not like celebrating his birthday with much fanfare
 unhone kaha ki agle saal anna 75 varsh ke ho jaaenge
 His supporters are planning to celebrate big on his 75th birthday
 bihar main vidhansabha chunaav ke maddenjar jediu or argedy ke bich siton ke bantwaare par baatcheet shuru ho chuki he
 Sharad Yadav remains the real mastermind of this conversation going on behind the scenes, who are constantly trying to find a way by talking to Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar
 sutron ke mutabik, jeetne kii kshamta ko hisit bantwareka aadhaar banaaya jayega
 But the special thing is that none of Lalu and Nitish wants to back down from their claims about seats
 samajha ja rahaa he ki nitish kumaar jahaan 120 se zyada siton par apana daawa jataa rahe hai, vahiin lalu prasad ne 130 siton par apana daawa thonk diya he
 The tussle between the two parties over seat sharing is being considered as neither of them wants to fight on lesser seats
 jabaki nitish kumaar apni seating seat se kam par ladane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 The knot of Mahagathbandhan is clearly visible regarding the bifurcation and bifurcation of Mahagathbandhan because the three-member team formed and the proposal to start talks on both sides was deflated
 ab tak donon taraf teen-teen sadasyon kaa naam tay nahin ho paaya, lekin sheersh netaa gathbandhan kii ganth sulajhane baith gaye hai
 Sharad Yadav has gone to Delhi after a round of talks with Lalu and Nitish
 sutron ke mutabik, lalu prasad ne sharad yadav ke saamne 130 siton par apni daavedaari thok di he or bachi 113 siton ko jediu or congress ke cote main rakhaa he
 However, rjdineta Raghuvansh Prasad says that there can be no condition in the alliance
 sabko ekadusre kii takat kaa sammaan karnaa hoga
 Raghuvansh Prasad Singh says, "look, we don't want to be infamous by speaking something, but if there is no alliance with the good and there is not enough seat sharing then there will be a lot of rebels
" aise jo hamen nuksaan karegein
 In such a situation, a lot of deliberation has to be done
 'nitish kii sharad ko do tukadusri ore, mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne sharad yadav ko bataa diya he ki party apni jiti hui siton se koi samjhauta nahin karegi
 That is, JDU is not ready for less than 120 seats
 aise main sharad yadav hi donon party ke bich siton ke daawey or counter daawey ke bich kaa rasta nikaal rahe hai
 It is understood that Lalu does not want to pay attention to the Congress until his seats are decided, while the JDU Philhaj does not want to open its cards
 argedy kii naarazginithish kumaarake akele poster bvoy banane par bhi he
 Lalu Prasad feels that the alliance has considered Nitish the leader, but Nitish Kumar is only engaged in his branding
 raghuvansh prasad singh ke mutabik ekatarfa prachaar se gathbandhan ko nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is expected to review this with his senior cabinet colleagues on Monday amid differences within the government over FDI limits in the pharmaceutical sector
 sutron ne bataaya ki is mudde par yojana ayog ke sadsy arun meda kii adhyakshata vaali samiti ne apni rapat pradhanmantri ko saunp di he
 Senior officers of the Ministries of Health, Industry, Law and Finance were also included in this committee and no consensus has been reached on the report of the committee
 aisa mana jaataa he ki swasthya mantralay ne rapat par asahmati patr dete hue bahurashtriya companiyon dwaara bhartiya dawa companiyon ke adhigrahan par puri tarah pratibandh lagane kii maang kii he
 It is worth mentioning that since 2006, there have been many mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical sector, in which multinational companies have acquired domestic companies like Rainbaxy and Piramal Healthcare
 sarkaar tathaa samaaj main bhi isko lekar chintaa he ki in vilay evam adhigrahan saudon ke kaaran jenrik dawaaon ke daam bade hai
 Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Congress said that Modi is embarrassing the country by going abroad and making derogatory statements about India
 congress ke anusaar, modi apane videshi dauron main lagaataar yah daawa kar rahe hai ki unke satta main aane ke baad desh kii vishwasaneeyata behaal hui he
 His claim is destroying the country's credibility
 congress netaa anand sharma ne kaha, 'hamamodi ke daawey ko puri tarah se nakaarte hai, jimasen vah kehete hai ki unke satta main aane ke baad se hi desh kii vishwasaneeyata behaal hui he
 Sharma says that Modi's claims that India had no credibility earlier, had no respect for the country before Modi came to power in May 2014
 sharma ne kaha, 'is baat ko har desh main jaakar kah kar vahadesh ko sharmasaar kar rahe hai
 India was also respected earlier
 bharat kii vishwasaneeyata thi or sarkaar kii nitiyon kii vajah se pehle bhi bharat epadiai ke lihaaj se sarvaadhik pasandida sthal tha
 Targeting Modi, the Congress leader said that there is an atmosphere of fear in India today and the Prime Minister responsible for it
 sharma ne kaha, 'modi ek aisi sarkaar kaa sanchaalan kar rahe hai, jo manamaane dhang se kaamkaaj kar rahi he
 'india will not tolerate intolerance: PM Modi: It is worth mentioning that PM Modi said in London on Thursday that India will never tolerate intolerance
 bharat main sampradayik tanaav ke bare main puche gaye ek sawaal ke jawaab main modi ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'bhartiya adhikari is tarah kii (hinsak) ghatnaon main shaamil logon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai karenge
 Describing India as the country of Lord Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi, he said, 'india will not tolerate intolerance
 ' modi ne kaha, 'ham ek loktantr hai
 Are committed to freedom of expression
 ham ek ashishnu samaaj nahin hai

 chayan samiti ko ek hafte ke bheetar baithak bulaane ko kaha gaya he
 The court said that there is no provision in the law regarding interim suspension or removal of CBI director
 sheersh adaalat ne saaf kar diya ki is tarah kaa koi bhi faisla chayan sahmati kii sahmati lene ke baad hi kiya ja saktaa he
 The three-member bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice KM Joseph, in its 44-page judgment, deprived Verma of his powers and made Joint Director m Nageswara Rao the interim director of CBI and CVC and Personnel and Training
 October 23, 2018 orders of the department (dopt) were repealed
