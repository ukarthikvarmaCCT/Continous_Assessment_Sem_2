 The next ball was on the middle stump
 usne baith kar sweep par boundry maar diya
 i said, seeing that eight runs have been made, the game is now stable
 teesraa wo phir sweep maarane gaya tha lekin ball of stump se baahar thi to slip main khel diya
 Then four

 But the next ball which was on the middle stump flicked and bound over square leg

 ’ Capital Delhi no longer needs aud-even: CM 'we put pressure on Government for raw colony' Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday made it clear that now Rajdhani does not need aud-even
 unhone dilliwaalon ko badi raahat dete hue kaha ki ab mausam saaf ho gaya he
 aud-even is no longer needed
 mukhyamantri ne pichley hafte kaha tha ki od-evan ko lagu rakhane par faisla somvaar ko liya jayega
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a press conference on Monday that now the weather has cleared
 ab od-evan kii jarurat nahin he
 He further said that some people were saying that only 5 percent of Delhi's air pollution is due to pollution, so the air quality index (AQI) decreased from more than 500 to less than 200 due to only 5 percent pollution
 He also said that there is a need for everyone to work together with clear intentions, not politics on pollution
 aage kejariwal ne supreme court main centre sarkaar ke halafname kaa zikr bhi kiya
 Recently, the central government had given an affidavit in the Supreme Court that starchy contributes only five percent to Delhi's pollution
 haalanki, dilli main is tarah ko koi vyavastha nahin he, jisase yah saaf ho sake ki pradooshan main kis cheez kaa kitna yogadan he
 On the issue of Kachhi Colony, CM Kejriwal targeted the Center and said that we continued to pressurize the Central Government for four years
 hamane satellite ke nakshe centre sarkaar ko bhej die the
 Despite the pressure, now the Center started work before the election
 kisi ke bahekaave mat aana
 Somebody is giving a website number
 koi certificate detaa tha, kejariwal aapako registry dilavaayega
 The Chief Minister said that if the raw colony is not confirmed then there will be agitation all over Delhi
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki dilli ke kai ilaakon main siver kii pipe line daal di gai he, lekin log pipe line daalane ke baavjood siver ke conection nahin le rahe hai
 In such a situation, sewage is being drained into the drains, which is going to the dirt in the Yamuna
 31 march tak siver conection freeh cmmukyamamwri kejariwal ne dilliwaalon ko raahat dete hue kaha ki cabinet ne faisla liya he ki rajdhani dilli main jahaan sivej line daali gai he, vahaan 31 march tak nae siver ke liye aavedan karte hai to koi bhi charge nahin liya jayega
 The sewer connection will be given free of cost on application in Delhi by 31 March
 mukhyamantri ne saaf kiya ki 31 march tak aavedan karne waalon ko deveopment, conection or road kating charge nahin dena padegaa
 He said that i will write a letter to those who have not taken the connection themselves
 ram vilaas paswan ko chalanjah cmpani ko lekar mukhyamantri ne kaha ki centre sarkaar ke mantri logon main dar paidaa kar rahe hai
 On the quality of water in Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal surrounded the Central Government and said that either Ram Vilas Paswan is right or Gajendra Singh Shekhawat is right? i challenge Ram Vilas Paswan, come with us and pick up the sample
 aane vaale dinon main media kii maujuudagi main pani ke sample uthaaenge, main ram vilaas paswan ko aamantrit karata hum
 Kejriwal, reading the statement of Gajendra Singh Sheikhwat and Manoj Tiwari, said that on 26 September, Union Water Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat gave a statement that Delhi's water is better than Europe's standard
 manoj tiwari ne bhi jal mantri ke is bayaan kaa samarthan kiya tha
 He further said that from 11 samples, the city's water cannot be described as good or bad
 ve yah nahin bataa rahe ki kis pate se sample uthaae gaye
 They should have picked up at least 2000 samples in Delhi, whereas the Delhi Jal Board itself raises 500 samples daily
 300 se adhik team activeh kejarivalkal tak jahrili dhundh kii maar jhel rahi rajdhani dilli ke liye mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne shuukravaar ko kaha tha ki dilli main od evan skim badhaani he yaa nahin, is par antim faisla somvaar ko liya jayega
 He said that tomorrow and the day after tomorrow he will check the quality of air, after which a decision will be taken on it
 dilli main od evan ko 4 se 15 november tak ke liye dilli main lagu kiya gaya tha
 On the pollution spread in Delhi, on Friday, Arvind Kejriwal said that most of the pollution in the capital is due to burning of straw in the neighboring states
 haryana main paraali jalaane kii ghatana main thodi kami ai he lekin punjab main abhi bhi ye sankhya zyada he
 Kejriwal said that we have more than 300 active teams in Delhi, who are keeping an eye on those who open garbage

 Power crisis may deepen in Jharkhand in the coming days
 darasal, rajya ke tenughat vidyut nigam limited (TVNL) main pichley 2 maheene se koyale kaa sankat barkaraar he
 One unit of this power plant is closed since April 15
 vahiin pichley 2 dinon se isaki duusari unit se bhi utpaadan puri tarah thapp ho chukaa he
 Why the plant closed This crisis has come due to coal company CCL stopping supply of coal to TVNL
 jaankaree ke mutabik TVNL main power production ke liye har din saadhe 7 hajaar ton koyale kii zarurat hoti he
 But only two to two and a half thousand tons of coal were being supplied by CCL since April
 use bhi beete do dinon se puri tarah se roak di gai he
 The effect of this is that the power generation from this 420 MW plant is completely closed
 rajya ko pratidin 2200 megawatt bijli kii jarurat he lekin philhal sirf 750 megawatt bijli hi di ja rahi he
 The balance of CCL 212 crore is given by Jharkhand to jharkhandbijli Vitran Nigam Limited every month, about 80 crore rupees of electricity
 jabaki iske evaj main use sirf 45 karod kaa hi bhugtan ho paa rahaa he
 At the same time, TVNL buys around 50 crore coal per month from CCL
 bijli vitaran nigam dwaara keval 45 karod hi die jane kii vajah se sisiel ko TVNL kii ore se puri raashi nahin di ja saki he
 Due to this ccl's arrears have increased to 212 crores

 Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh today lashed out at the Congress (congress) at an election rally in Chatra
 unhone congress par aatankwaad ke khilaaf chalaai ja rahi muhim ko kamjor karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 He said that when we avenged the Pulwama attack as a surgical strike, the Congress is asking for proof
 kya jawan aatankiyon ko maarane ke baad plane khadey karke laashen ginate? unhone congressiyon par tanj kasate hue kaha ki bahadur laashen nahin ginate, laashen ginaney kaa kaam gidhon kaa hota he
 Rajnath reached Chatra to address the election rally in favor of BJP candidate Sunil Singh
 yahaan unhone kaha ki sabhi ne purv kii sarkaron ko dekha he or ab bijepi sarkaar ke kaaryon ko bhi dekh rahe hai
 Allegations of corruption have been proved against Congress ministers but till date no minister has been accused of BJP government
 unhone kaha ki kuch maheenon main bharat duniya ke paanch dhanwaan deshon kii shrenee main tisare sthaan par khadaa hoga
 Taking a dig at the Congress, the Home Minister said that the Congress did not work in the security sector thinking that countries like Russia, China and America would get angry
 lekin piem modi ne vaigyanikon kaa manobal badhaayaa he
 Due to which we stand as a strong nation today
 unhone kaha ki hamaare paas aisi missile hai jo dushmano kii missile ko lonching se mahaj teen minute ke bheetar nestnabud kar sakati hai
 Rajnath said that this work of the government is not acceptable to the Congress
 yahi kaaran he ki man main ganth hone ke baad bhi bandhan kar liya he
 These people want to stop Modi's development work by having a grand alliance
 grih mantri ne kaha ki rahul gandhi kehete hai ki hamaari sarkaar aegi to ham garibi ko mitaa denge
 These people do politics by throwing dust in people's eyes
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri or raashtrapati koi vyakti nahin sanstha hota he
 In such a situation, if democracy breaks in the democratic system then the country is weak
 rajnath ne kaha ki jab desh congress mukt hoga tabhi garibi mukt hoga
 He warned Pakistan that we will not leave anyone but if someone tries to tease us, we will not leave
 grih mantri ne kaha ki naksalwad ab sirf saat rajyon main simatakar rah gaya he
 It will be uprooted in the next two-three years
 bharat main hinsa kaa koi sthaan nahin he
 Rajnath said that when Indira Gandhi can be praised for action on Pakistan, then why not PM Modi
 aatankwaad kisi bhi surat main bardaasht nahin kiya jayega

 is desh kaa pradhanmantri kaisaa ho
 Is everyone happy with the UPA government? mahangaai ke khilaaf janata kitne gusse main he, koun he badhati mahangaai kaa sabase bada jimmedaar
 If elections are held today, then the camel will sit
 ye tamaam sawaal hai, jo har bhartiya ke man main aksar uthte rahete hai
 Till date we have brought answers to such stinging questions
 wo jawaab jo janata ne hi die hai
 India Today, AC Nilsson and org-marg have prepared this survey among the people
 survey ko dekhen to aisa lagata he ki rahul ab logon ke dilon par raaj karne lage hai
 But, Manmohan Singh's graph has fallen badly
 logon se poocha gaya tha ki koun hoga aapke sapanom ke bharat kaa pradhanmantri
 The answers received clearly show the growing popularity of Rahul
 unke haq main 29 fisadi logon ne apana vot diya
 This increase in popularity is 21% compared to last year's survey
 itnaa zyada, jitna koi lokapriy he bhi nahin
 According to the survey, Manmohan Singh's image has become quite bleak in the hearts of the people in the last year
 sabase pasandida piem ke sawaal par jawaab main manmohan singh kaa graph buree tarah gira he
 Last year, he was the most preferred prime ministerial candidate
 lekin isbaar wo is shrenee main sabase neeche hai
 This time only 1 percent people considered him a good candidate for PM
 is survey main sabase hairaan karne vaali baat jo saamne ai he, wo ye ki atal bihari vaajapeyi aaj bhi desh ke ek bade tabake main kaaphi lokapriy hai
 Neither he is in pm's race nor he is now contesting elections
 phir bhi is survey main log unhen piem ke taur par doosraa sabase acha ummidavaar maanate hai
 In this annual survey of India Today, many important things related to the country and the people of the country have been revealed
 lekin, chunavi loktantr kii sabase oonchi kursi ke liye logon kii pasand main itnaa bada badlaav aana bade sanket to hai hi
 Manmohan is backward on Rahul on the question of favorite Prime Minister
 sabase hairaan karne vaali baat ye he ki wo desh ke baaki ke kai netaaon se bhi peeche hai
 The extent is that people consider Narendra Modi, Advani and Mayawati to be better PM than Manmohan Singh
 logon se jab manmohan singh ke pradarshan par sawaal poocha gaya to iske jawaab bhi chaunkaane vaale hi the
 The amount of every good answer for him has decreased compared to the 2009 survey
 haa, unhen kharaab piem maanane vaale logon kii taadaad main baari ijapha hua he
 In 2009, where only 7 percent people considered him a bad PM
 is saal 22 fisadi logon kaa bharosa unpar se uth gaya he
 When people were asked about the functioning of the UPA government in the last one year, 39 per cent people called it average and 26 per cent said it was bad
 matlab agar ausat or kharaab ko jod den, to aankada 65 fisadi kaa ho jaataa he
 We asked questions about how life has changed over the last year
 54 fisadi logon ne kaha jaisi kii taisi he
 30 percent reported worse
 kul milakar 84 fisadi logon ko kuch bhi thik nahin lag rahaa he
 Now the magic that Rahul Gandhi has wrought
 sabase bada sawaal ye he ki rahul gandhi kin dilon par sabase zyada raaj kar rahe hai
 The answers show that Rahul has cast a spell on every heart
 purush hon yaa stri
 Rahul Gandhi is his first choice
 baat yuvaaon kii karen, to 18 se 24 saal tak ke logon main 32 fisadi rahul ko chaahate hai
 Even in the 25 to 44 age group, Rahul is the most like
 sabase chaunkaane vaala aankada gramin or shahari ilaakon ke logon ke jawaab se mila he
 Rahul's magic has been equal in both areas
 jab yahi sawaal hindu, muslim or isai varg ke logon se poocha gaya, to muslim or isai varg ke to log unhen sabase zyada pasand karte hi hai
 He is also the most preferred leader among the Hindu class
 desh ke 19 rajyon main 26 june 2010 se 15 july 2010 tak kiye gaye is survey main 98 loksabhaa kshetron ke 12 hajaar 392 votaron ke sample liye gaye hai
 Generally, such a survey is likely to make a difference of only three per cent
 wo hon naa hon, log aaj bhi unhen yaad karte hai
 They don't stay, people never forget their work
 majboot faisle, thos iraade, himmati karrwai
 Indira Gandhi may have been accused of dictatorship of Emergency
 lekin, log aaj bhi kehete hai ki piem ho to indira kii tarah
 The survey asked who has been the best PM of the country so far
 indira gandhi ke haq main sabase zyada 31 fisadi logon ne jawaab diya
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee was at number two
 vartmaan pradhanmantri ko sabase kam 7 fisadi vot mili
 Meaning that it is public, which knows everything
 ye jaanati he ki pradhanmantri kii kursi par baithkar bade or ahm faisle lene hote hai
 Merely avoiding issues does not work
 logon ke dil par raaj karne ke liye logon ke liye kuch kade faisle karne hote hai
 And that's why Indira Gandhi is still in the minds of common people

 saadhe teen ghante main ham thailand pahunch sakate hai
 The second reason is the availability of hotels and catering facilities in a low budget
 unhone bataaya, ‘‘thailand main bharatiyon kii shaadi ke liye pandit ji se lekar bhartiya deje, menhadi vaala, hathi, ghodi, bhartiya khanpan sabhi kuch uplabdh hai

 Clarke wrote in his column in The Daily Telegraph, "I like the aggressiveness of my bowlers
 melbern main damdaar jeet ke dauraan unhone jis tarah se bhartiya puchhlle ballebaajon ko nibataya vah ravaiya mujhe pasand he
 "if the conditions were favorable and they again bowled (short pitch) to the Indians during the second Test this week in Sydney, then i would not be troubled," he said
 main chahta hum ki ham apni nirmamata banaae rakhen tathaa balle or gend se emsiji kii tarah hi pradarshan karen
 Australia won the first Test by 122 runs in four days and Clarke praised the team's "positive gesture"
 unhone kaha, ‘‘isse hamane bharatiyon ke saamne saaf kar diya ki ham unki prayek chunauti ke liye taiyaar hai
 Clarke, however, admitted that Australia would have to be cautious in the second match as the Indians are known for making a strong comeback
 unhone kaha, ‘‘sidney main hamen satarkta baratani hogi tathaa paristhitiyon ke anuroop khelnaa hoga
 There are many great players in the Indian team and they can make a comeback

 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘hamaari ballebaaji kaa patan hua lekin hamaari pratidwandvi team ke saath bhi aisa hua
 India's strong batting lineup, bowling out for just 169, shows how difficult it is to bat in front of a good bowling attack under favorable conditions
 ’’ clark ne prashansakon se senior ballebaaj riki ponting or maaikel hassi kaa samarthan karne ke liye bhi kaha
 "australian audiences appreciate the invaluable contributions of Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman and Virender Sehwag," he said

 The strong evidence of corruption that the ICC got in the Ajman All Stars T20 League gave credit for the victory against Shreyansh to his fitness

 Lucknow Lok Sabha seat has been occupied by BJP for a long time as well as former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's political workplace
 maujuuda daur main atal kii siyaasi viraasat sambhaal rahe bijepi ke diggaj netaa or kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh ek baar phir lakhanu ke siyaasi ranbhumi main utre hai
 The SP has made Lucknow's political battle interesting by taking the BJP against Poonam Sinha, the wife of Shatrughan Sinha, who joined the Congress recently, and the Congress against Acharya Pramod Krishnam against Rajnath
 haalanki teenon hi mukhya raajnneetik dal ke ummidavaar lakhanu se baahar ke hai
 Lucknow Lok Sabha seat is considered a strong stronghold of BJP
 yahaan par 1991 se lagaataar bijepi kaa kabja he
 SP and BSP have not been able to open their account on this seat till date
 rajnath lakhanu seat se dobaaraa chunavi maidan main utre hai
 On Tuesday, he filed nomination papers
 rajnath singh mularup se chandauli ke rahane vaale hai
 The SP has played bet on Poonam Sinha keeping Kayastha voters in mind
 punam sinha bihar kii patna kii rahane vaali hai or mumbai main rah rahi hai
 At the same time, the Congress has relied on Acharya Pramod Krishnam to defeat Rajnath through the Brahmin and Muslim equation
 lekin bijepi ke durg ko bhednaa vipaksh ke itnaa hi aasaan nahin he
 Pramod Krishnam is a resident of Sambhal in UP
 purv pradhanmantri atal vihari vaajapeyi ne lakhanu sansadeey seat par 1991, 1996, 1998, 1999 or 2004 tak lagaataar jeet darj kii thi
 Neither Rajabbar could beat Vajpayee in Lucknow, neither Muzaffar Ali nor Raja Karn Singh
 2009 main bijepi se laal ji tandon ne is seat se chunaav jitkar sansad pahunche
 Following the political equation on the lines of Vajpayee, Rajnath Singh defeated the political battle of 2014 and defeated Rita Bahuguna Joshi of the Congress by nearly three lakh votes
 darasal rajnath singh ke lakhanu main majboot pakad hone ke peeche unki apni chhavi he
 As a result, Hindus as well as Muslim voters also voted in large numbers in their favor in the last election
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki sapa or congress donon partiyaan muslim maton ko apane paksh main ekajute karne main safal nahin rah saki
 If we look at the political equation of Lucknow Lok Sabha seat, then a large population belongs to the Muslim community
 muslim 20 fisadi, anusuchit jati 14
 The voters are 5 percent, Brahmins 8 percent, Rajput 7 percent, OBC 28 percent, Vaishya 10 and other 12 percent
 lakhanu sansadeey seat par paanch vidhansabha siten hai or maujuuda samay main sabhi par bijepi kaa kabja he
 SP and Congress have played big bets to surround Rajnath Singh in the battle of Lucknow this time
 sapa shatrughna sinha ke staradam ko cash karaane ke liye unki patni punam sinha ko utaara he
 The biggest responsibility over Poonam Sinha will be to win the hearts of the Kayastha voters of Lucknow, who are currently the traditional BJP voters
 iske alaava lakhanu seat se puri tarah se unke liye nai he or sapa-basapa kaaryakartaaon se puri tarah waakif nahin he
 In such a situation, they may have to face many difficulties at the ground level
 iske alaava sapa or basapa is seat par kabhi bhi jeet nahin saki he
 In such a situation, the responsibility of opening the account of SP is on his shoulders
 acharya pramod krishnam 2014 main sanbhal seat se congress ummidavaar ke taur par chunavi maidan main utre the
 But could not win
 pramod krishnam kii musalamaanon ke bich kaaphi acchhee chhavi he
 Due to this, the Congress has fielded him in Lucknow parliamentary seat
 aise main muslim matadaataaon ke saath-saath brahman matadaataaon ko saadhane kii chunauti hogi
 If Pramod Krishnam manages to make this equation, it can become an obstacle in bjp's path

 'team' kaa matlab wo group hota he jo saath milakar kaam kare, lekin in dinon 'team india' kaa matlab sirf viraat kohli or mohammad shami hota ja rahaa he
 If you see in recent days, if someone has been able to consistently perform well for India, then it is only Kohli and Shami
 2013 main viraat kohli, shikhar dhawan or rohit sharma kaa balla khub chalaa or teenon ne pichley saal ek-ek hajaar se zyada ran bhi banaae
 Due to this, India also sat on the number one chair in the ranking
 lekin saal ke ant tak rohit or dhawan ke balle kii chamak feeki pad chuki thi
 And now Team India's number one crown is also in danger, because Australia is constantly beating England
 dakshin africa main bhi apni dharti ke sher hue the flopapichley dakshin africa daure se lekar newjiland main pehle vanade tak rohit sharma, shikhar dhawan, mahendra singh dhoni, suresh raina, ravindra jadeja, aar aswin, ishanth sharma or bhubaneshwar kumaar sabhi flop rahe hai
 India lost two of the three matches in South Africa and Indradevata survived the loss in the third
 newjiland main bhi nae saal kii shuruyaat haar se hui
 In South Africa, Rohit scored just 37 runs in 2 innings of 3 matches, Shikhar Dhawan 12 runs in 2 innings of 3 matches, Suresh Raina 50 runs in 2 innings of 3 matches and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni scored 84 in 2 innings of 3 matches
 Scored
 yuvaraj bhi 2 maichon main khele, jahaan ek pari main ve khaataa bhi nahin khol paae
 Talking about the bowlers, Mohammed Shami was the only bowler who impressed everyone and took 9 wickets in 3 matches, all the rest proved to be flops
 team main baaki gendbaaj or ballebaaj kis kaam ke?nae saal main newjiland siries main sabhi ko ummid thi kii vahaan bharat kuch acha pradarshan karegaa lekin jis tarah kii shuruyaat vahaan hui wo behad niraashajanak he
 First of all, is there no other bowler apart from Mohammed Shami who can bring success to the team? Shami took India 2 wickets in the first spell, but as he bowled out, the Indian bowler was in a rush to pick up the wickets and Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor added 121 runs for the third wicket
 sawaal ye uthta he ki shami ne agar newjiland ke 32 par 2 wicket gira die, uske baad team ke anya gendbaaj kis kaam ke hai? ye haal nepier vanade main hi nahin balki dakshin africa main bhi tha
 Frustrating in batting too, India is even more frustrated when it comes to bowling
 gautam gambhir ko to vishwa cap ke probables main bhi jagah nahin milti he lekin udhar rohit sharma or shikhar dhawan ab match dar match flop hi sabit ho rahe hai
 Apart from Kohli, there is no batsman who can regularly score runs for India in every situation
 bharat kaa madhyakram to kabhi tha hi nahin, lekin 2013 main to kam se kam bharat apane top order (rohit, viraat or dhawan) or nichle madhyakram (dhoni) ki vajah se match jeet bhi rahaa tha, lekin ab to vaisaa bhi nahin he
 If the eye is on the World Cup, then it has to be taken very soon after the learners ODI, Captain Dhoni praised his bowlers because they did not let New Zealand score 300 runs
 kya 292 ran dene vaale or ek-ek wicket ke liye tarasane vaale team india ke gendbaaj mahaj itani si baat ke liye tarif ke hakdaar hai? kahaan gai captain kii wo soch jo jeet ke baad kabhi santusht nahin rahete the? kahaan gai captain kii wo kabhi naa mitane vaali bhukh jo jeet ke liye kabhi mitati nahin thi?galatiyon se sikh le team indiyasbase ahm cheez jo dhoni ko kerani he wo ye ki newjiland kii dharti par kis tarah kii team lekar maidan par utaaren ye unhen dobaaraa sochane kii zarurat he
 When will the captain understand that 2 spinners are of no use in New Zealand
 aswin ko kyon khilaayaa gaya kisi ke samaj nahin aayaa, agar aswin kii jagah stuart binni ko khilaayaa jaataa to shaayad team ke liye behatar sabit hota, kyonki newjiland main aapako aise hi khiladiyon kii zarurat hoti he jo tej gendbaaji ke saath-saath balle se bhi yogadan de sake
 Also, if India is taking this series as a preparation for the World Cup next year, then soon India will have to think about the option of Suresh Raina

 10 agast 1963 ko upi main jalon ke 'ghuraa kaa purava' main phulan kaa janm hua tha
 Born into a poor and 'small caste', Phoolan was unabashed
 usne maa se suna tha ki chachaa ne unki jameen hadap lee thi
 Faced with uncle at the age of ten
 jameen ke liye dharna diya
 Punishment had to be met
 usee 10 saal kii umr main uski shaadi kar di gai
 The middle-aged husband began to torture her from the first night of marriage, which lasted a long time
 us aadmi ne phulan se balaatkaar kiya
 Then it became a daily routine
 jisaki vajah se uski sehat bighad gai or use maayke aana padaa, udhar pati ne duusari shaadi kar lee
 Then luck took another turn
 isi dauraan phulan ke nae dost bane
 Some of whom were bandits
 phulan ke mutabik kismat ko yahi manjuur tha
 The gang's chief Babu Gujjar wanted him
 vahiin, daaku vikram mallaah bhi phulan se pyaar tha
 Vikram and Babu had such a tussle about Phoolan that one day Vikram murdered him and became the leader of the gang
 ab phulan or vikram saath rahane lage the
 What was it then, one day Phoolan went with her gang to her husband's village
 vahaan usne pati or uski bivi donon kii jamkar pitayee kii
 On the other hand, another gang of dacoits was Thakur gang
 jiskaa sargana tha shriram thakur or lala thakur

 donon guton main ladaai chhid gai
 a bloody clash took place between the Thakur gang and Vikram Mallah gang
 chhipate-chhipate phulan or mallaah kuch der ke liye aaraam karne baithe
 On the same night, there was a relationship between Phoolan and Mallah
 donon jab soe to ek duusare ke saath the, par jab uthe to phulan thakur giroh kii giraft main thi
 He kidnapped Phoolan by killing Vikram Mallah
 phulan ne apni kitaab main kusum naam kii mahila kaa zikr kiya he, jisane phulan ke saare gahane uske badan se utaar liye the
 Phoolan wrote, 'kusum tore my clothes and left me naked in front of men'
 thakur giroh use nagn avasthaa main rassiyon se baandhakar nadi ke raste behamai gaanv le gaya tha
 Where she was naked in the entire village
 uske baad sabase pehle shriram thakur uske sang rape kiya
 Then in turn the people of the village looted his honor
 ve use baalo se pakadakar khinch rahe the
 Phoolan was also hit hard by sticks
 bataaya jaataa he ki thakuron ne do saptaah se adhik samay tak phulan ko nagn avasthaa main rakhaa
 Phoolan was a hostage
 uske saath roj samuhik balaatkaar kiya jaataa
 That is until she faints

 After leaving here, Phoolan rejoined the gang of bandits
 1981 main phulan behamai gaanv lauti

 baaki ke bare main poocha, to kisi ne kuch nahin bataaya
 Phoolan fired 22 Thakurs from the village and shot them simultaneously
 yahi wo hatyakand tha, jisane phulan kii chhavi khoonkhaar dakait kii bana di
 There was a ruckus all around
 media ne phulan ko nayaa naam diya, 'bandit queen'
 On the government's initiative, Bhind SP Rajendra Chaturvedi kept talking to Phoolan's gang
 ye unka hi kamaal tha ki phulan aatmasamarpan ko raji ho gayi
 He surrendered before the then Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Arjun Singh
 us samay un par 22 hatya, 30 dakaiti or 18 apharan ke chargeej the
 Phoolan had to spend 11 years in jail

 Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan's confession on terrorism can go in favor of India
 imran ne mangalvaar ko kaha tha ki afghanistan or kashmir main prashikshit kiye gaye 30,000 se 40,000 aatanki pakistan main abhi bhi sakriy hai
 Pakistan may get into trouble with Imran Khan's statement to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an organization working against the funding of terror around the world
 'da hindu' kii report ke mutabik, bharat FATF kii oktober main hone vaali baithak se pehle apni report main imran khan kii tippanee kaa ullekh karne par vichaar kar rahaa he
 In a conversation with a think tank in Washington on Tuesday, Imran Khan said that a 'national Action Plan' against terrorism was brought after the Peshawar school attack in December 2015, but it should be implemented only after his government came in last year
 Could
 30,000-40,000 aatanki hai sakriy'united stats institute of pis' se baatcheet main imran ne kaha, purvavarti sarkarein 'neshnal ection plan' par koi kaam nahin kar sakin, kyonki agar aap aatanki samoohon kii baat karte hai to vartmaan main 30,000-40,000 log hai jinke paas hathiyaar hai or inhen prashikshit kiya ja rahaa he
 This is the first clear confession from Pakistan that thousands of active terrorists and training camps are being operated from their land
 imran ne ek anya event main yah bhi kaha ki 2001 main 9 / 11 ke hamale ke baad kareeb 40 aatanki sanghathan sakriy hai
 In New Delhi, government sources said that they were happy that the Pakistani Prime Minister had accepted the fact that terrorist organizations were active on their land
 ek adhikari ne 'da hindu' se kaha, haalanki, pakistani netritv ke liye yah bhi jaruri he ki vah apane niyantran vaale kshetra main vishwasaneey karrwai karte hue aatanki thikaanon ko nasht kare
 Imran's statement, unlike the army, should tell that Khan's remarks on the existence of terrorist organizations are completely opposite from the Pakistani army
 april main jab FATF ne dharmik kattapanthi sansthaaon par karrwai kii thi to pakistani sena ke pravaktaa ne kaha tha ki desh main koi bhi aatanki sanghathan maujuud nahin he
 Khan said in Washington, "for the first time the Government of Pakistan has initiated action against terrorists, we have captured their institutions and now our administration is there
" imran ne apni purvavarti sarkaron par yues se sachai chhipaane kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 FATF can blacklist: Official sources said that the figure of terrorists given by Imran Khan is much higher than the number of documents given in front of Pakistan's FATF
 pakistan agar aatank par apane ection plan ke tahat aatankwaad ko khatm karne kii sharten puri nahin kar paata he to oktober main FATF se blaclist ho saktaa he
 Schedule-4 of Pakistan's anti-terrorism Act gives detailed information about banned terrorist organizations, in which the government has listed only 8000 active terrorists
 sutara ne bataaya, imran khan ke bayaan se yah sawaal paidaa ho gaya he ki pakistan jis FATF acshan plan par jor-shor se amal kii baat kar rahaa he, vah asal main kitna prabhavi he? iske saath hi bharat ko sanstha ke saamne is mudde ko uthaane kaa mauka mil gaya he
 This is not the first time that Imran Khan has opened up a controversy by revealing terrorism
 isi saal april maheene main, pakistan kii sansad main unki khub aalochana hui thi kyonki unhone tehran main irani raashtrapati ke saath mulaakaat main kaha tha ki pakistan kii sarajameen par iran virdohi aatanki sanghathan sakriy the

 Rule 1 of Article 41 of the Constitution of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) states; "in case of any player, umpire, team officer, selector and any person connected with the board, any incident related to the behavior, discipline and violation of the rule or any complaint related to it from any source, the Apex Institution case should be given a preliminary inquiry
 To the Chief Executive (CEO) within 48 hours 



 And now this constitution is raising questions for the BCCI and Cricket Administrative Committee (COA): some such Sourav Ganguly defended KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya
 The current picture is clearly saying that COA members Vinod Rai and Diana Edulji The COA itself has turned into a matter of further ridicule and concern due to mutual differences of opinion
 kaaran yah he ki is jaanch ke 'drame' ne hardik pandya or keel rahul ke bhavishya ko daanv par laga diya he, jo pehle hi kahin ‘zyada sajaa' bhugat chuke hai
 There is no scope for debate that if the rules have to be changed to punish both players, it should be
 karan johar ke ‘sho' main hardik pandya kii kahi baaten katai sweekaarya nahin hai
 But for any offense or mistake there is a very thick line between making the players or the associated person realize it and 'destroy' them
 media hi nahin, aam cricketpremiyon ko bhi yah moti rekha saaf taur par dikh rahi he
 Discussions are going on openly, so why doesn't the COA see this thick line? Unfortunately, just like the words of Hardik Pandya, BCCI or COA have crossed this line
 hardik pandya ke pita, bole- meraa betaa na ghar se nikal rahaa he na hi uthaa rahaa he kisi kaa phonwajah saaf he ki jahaan niyam ke hisaab se jaanch 48 ghante ke bheetar shuru honi he, vahiin abhi bhi yah tay hona baaki he ki jaanch kaise hogi or koun karegaa
 And this is happening due to differences between the two members of COA
 ek sadsy kaa siio rahul johari main hi bharosa nahin he! aise main phir siio kaa board main kya auchity he? or jaanch ke sanvaidhanik niyam kaa kya matlab rah jaataa he? baharhaal, is tamaashe se keel rahul, hardik pandya or team india kii worldcup kii planning or taiyaari ke lihaaj se bahut hi mahatvapurn samay jarur barbaad ho rahaa he
 Now that the subject of the investigation was to be within the purview of the BCCI constitution, the board made another major mistake in this case by going to the court and demanding the constitution of Lokpal
 brihaspativaar ko supreme court ne maamle kii sunwaayee ek hafte ke liye taal di
 Meaning that this hearing will be possible till January 26
 is din team india, newjiland kii dharti par uske khilaaf doosraa vanade muqabla khel rahi hogi
 To this day, KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya would have been suspended from five matches, including three odis against Australia
 
 
 or agar sunwaayee ‘sahi or sucharu tareeke' se nahin hui, to jaanch kaa parinaam aane tak donon khilaadi or kai maichon se baahar ho chuke honge
 After all, how much punishment will these two have to bear? Is the loss of five matches not enough to make both of them feel at fault or enough punishment? What does COA want? If the current situation continues, will both the players be able to get a good mood and necessary match practice in terms of World Cup preparations? Especially given that before the World Cup, Team India hardly has 10-11 matches left
 hardik pandya ko ek or bada jhatka, diggaj company ne khatm kiya qaraar, 'bada nuksaan'vastav main COA kaa ravaiya na keval keel rahul or hardik pandya ke kariyar ko nuksaan pahunchaa rahaa he, balki vah worldcup ke liye team india kii planning or taiyaariyon par bhi asar daal rahaa he
 Nor is the COA setting a good example with its attitude
 yah baat bhi nahin bhuuli jaaniye chahie ki donon hi khilaadi pehle se hi kahin kadi sajaa paa chuke hai
 Five matches (who knows how many more?), Contracts, image, honors, etc
 or ‘nyaay ke naiysargik siddhant' ke niyamon ke hisaab se yah jarurat se kahin zyada ho chukaa he! sawaal yah he ki agar yahi ghatana worldcup ke aas-paas hoti
 And if both these players were performing exceptionally or some 'big-name' player of Team India got caught in such an incident, would the COA still have the same attitude? In fact, like KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya, the COA would There is also a need to fix your 'gait'
 ‘jarurat se zyada' ho chuke is mudde par bhartiya cricket ke un lijendon ko saamne aane kii jarurat he jinhone hardik va keel rahul ke liye kade shabdon kaa istemaal kiya
 Both of them have got their share of punishment fairly
 philhal jaise is maamle se nipta ja rahaa, vah inhen sudharta kam ‘tabah karata' zyada dikhaai pad rahaa he
 Team India needs both players and these are very important for the planning of the World Cup
 saurav ganguli ne sahi hi kaha ki khilaadi koi mashin nahin he ki har baat unase sahi hi nikle
 Going beyond this, both need to be given a platform again
 kya sioe kii bevajaah kii jid barkaraar rahati he yaa is babat koi ‘uchit maarg' nikalegaa? yahi ab bada sawaal ho chalaa he

 ye donon dal har roj aam janata ko apni taraf aakarshith karne ke liye nae-nae vaade or kshetreey partiyon se gathbandhan kar rahe hai
 But both these two are also seen to be soured in the relationship with their old allies
 karnataka main congress kaa janata dal (secular) or bijepi kaa maharashtra main shivasena ke saath rishte ko lekar sab kuch thik nahin he
 The Congress formed a grand alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in Bihar and several other parties including former Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Samata Party to oust the Modi government from power in the upcoming general elections
 maharashtra main rashtravaadi congress party (NCP) or congress ke saath gathbandhan ko lagbhag antim rup diya ja chukaa he
 The announcement is yet to be formally announced
 lekin use karnataka main jedies ke saath rishton ko lekar talkhi kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 On Monday, it came even as Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy said, "he is ready to step down, Congress mlas are crossing their limits
" congress netaaon ko apane vidhayakon ko control karnaa chahie
 In Karnataka, the whole controversy is going on about the inclusion of more people in the cabinet
 The politics that has come up
 In fact, some Congress mlas said that their leader is not Siddaramaiah of the Congress but Kumaraswamy
 jisase echdi kumaraswami naaraaz the
 Kumaraswamy said that Congress should look into all these issues, if they want to continue all this, then i am ready to step down
 yah koi pehla mauka nahin jab unhen apana dard saajha karnaa padaa he
 He has already given a statement in this way
 kaha gaya ki jedies or congress main isi khinchataan ke bich bijepi ne karnataka main oparation lotus chalaane kaa prayaas kiya
 However, Congress leader Shahnawaz Alam rejects any problem in JDS and Congress
 unka kahana he ki bijepi loktantr ko pansad nahin he
 She wants to kill democracy
 isliye jin rajyon main bijepi bahumat ke kareeb he, vahaan jodtod karke congress kii sarkaron ko asthir karnaa chaahati he
 Whether it is Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh or Goa
 baharhaal congress bhale hi puraane sahyogi dalon se khatas kii baat se inkaar kar rahi he, lekin inke bich talkhi saamne aa hi ja rahi he
 Because the disputes between the Congress and the JDS government of Karnataka, formed by the Grand Alliance formula, are often coming to the surface
 bijepi ko aankh dikhaate sahyogivahin, bijepi ko bhi apane puraane sahyogi dalon se naaraazgi jhelni pad rahi he
 Be it Maharashtra Shiv Sena or Om Prakash Rajbhar, President of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party in Uttar Pradesh and Minister in Yogi Government or Anupriya Patel, President of Apna Dal (S), when these parties keep showing eyes to BJP
 endie main rahe or modi sarkaar main mantri upendra kushvaha kii rashtriya lok samta party (araspi) pehle hi bijepi kaa saath chhod chuki he
 Now BJP is left with Nitish Kumar's party JDU in Bihar
 maharashtra main to talkhi itani bad chuki he ki loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle bijepi or shivasena main khud ko bada bhai sabit karne kii jang chhid gai he
 Shiv Sena met on Monday
 isamen yahi sanket mili ki shivasena apni baat se peeche hatane vaali nahin he
 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut says, "in Maharashtra, Shiv Sena will play the role of elder brother
 hamen bijepi kaa 50-50 formula manjuur nahin he
 In this meeting, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray exhorted his mps to keep raising the issue of Rafale aircraft deal loudly
 ve rafel deal ko lekar jepisi kii maang ko sansad main uthaate rahe
 On this attitude of Shiv Sena, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said that we are not eager for an alliance
 in donon bayanon ke aaine main dekhen inke rishton ko saaf-saaf dekha ja saktaa he
 In fact, the Shiv Sena is a BJP ally in the central and Maharashtra governments and wants it to be given more preference, but the talk of Devendra Fadnavis suggests that the BJP is not in its mood
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv main bijepi pehle se zyada taqatvar banakar satta main ai he
 The first Parliament session of the second term of the Modi government started on Monday i
e
 17 June which will run till 26 July
 40 dinon tak chalane vaale sansad ke satr main sarkaar muslim mahilaon ko teen talaak se nijaat dilaane ke liye vidheyak pesh karegi
 At the same time, after the drastic defeat in the Lok Sabha, the Congress is stuck in a religious crisis on the triple talaq bill
 congress sansad main agar teen talaak kaa virodh karti he to bijepi ke muslim tushtikaran ke aaropon kaa saamana karnaa hoga or agar samarthan karti he to muslim vot bank ke naaraaz hone kaa dar rahegaa
 In such a situation, it has to be seen what approach Congress takes in Parliament
 centre main duusari baar modi sarkaar banane ke baad cabinet kii pehali baithak main muslim mahilaon ko tripal talaak se nijaat dilaane ke liye teen talaak ke ordinance ko manjuuri di he, jise ab sansad main pesh kiye janaa he
 Although in the year 2017, the government passed this bill related to the rights of Muslim women from the Lok Sabha but could not be passed by the Rajya Sabha and the bill was sent back by the Upper House
 17veen loksabhaa ke gathan ke baad yah swaabhaavik rup se nirast ho gaya
 This is the reason that ordinance related to triple talaq was approved in the cabinet meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi recently
 isamen vipaksh kii kuch maangon ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he
 After this, now the bill related to triple talaq is as follows
 1- is maamle main exiaar tabhi sweekaarya kii jaaegi jab patni yaa uske najdiki khun vaale rishtedaar ise darj karaayenge
 The opposition and many organizations were concerned that someone might misuse the FIR in this case
 2- patni or pati ke bich agar baad main samjhaute kii koi pahal hoti he to magistrate samjhauta kara sakate hai
 Whereas the earlier bill did not have provisions for this
 vipaksh kaa tark tha ki isaki vyavastha honi chahie
 3- Immediate triple talaq will still remain a non-bailable offense, but now such arrangements have been made that the magistrate can grant bail in it
 haalanki isse pehle magistrate ko patni kii sunwaayee kerani hogi
 Earlier the bill did not provide scope for bail after the provision of sentence of three years
 darasal pichley satr main jab sarkaar ne antim din rajyasabha main is bill ko pesh kiya tha to vipaksh ne yah kahkar bill paas nahin hone diya tha ki sarkaar ne hadabadi main bina sabaki sahmati ke is vidheyak ko pesh kar diya he
 Now the government has amended the triple talaq bill and approved the new ordinance, which will be introduced by the Modi government in this budget session of Parliament
 congress ke rajyasabha sadsy or pravaktaa abhishek manu singhvi ne pichley dinon patrakaron se baat karte hue kaha tha, 'teen talaak par hamane kuch buniyadi mudde uthaae hai
 The government has agreed on several points
 haalanki singhvi ne kaha ki abhi bhi ek yaa do bindu bache hai or un binduon par charchaa kii jarurat he
 In such a situation, we will oppose the Bill
 'congress hi nahin bijepi kii pramukh sahyogi jediu bhi is baat par adig he ki teen talaak ke doshiyon kii sajaa ko aapraadhik shrenee main rakhana kisi bhi surat main vyaavhaarik kadam nahin ho saktaa
 JDU has announced not to support BJP on this bill in Rajya Sabha on the issue of triple talaq
 jediu kaa kahana he ki teen talaak ek saamaajik mudda he or ise saamaajik str par samaaj ke jariye suljhaayaa janaa chahie
 However, after the way the Congress has lost in the Lok Sabha elections, now it will not be easy for him to take a stand on the triple talaq bill as before
 yahi vajah he ki congress netaa dabi jubaan se kah rahe hai ki party pehle kii tarah is bill kaa virodh nahin karegi
 In fact, if the Congress opposes, it will also have to face the bjp's charge of Muslim appeasement
 bijepi netaa kai baar kah chuke hai ki congress muslim vot bank ke chalate is vidheyak kaa virodh karti rahi he
 However, the Supreme Court's move to declare triple talaq as illegal was welcomed by almost all parties including Congress
 unka virodh sarkaar dwaara aadhyadesh ke jariye laae gaye vidheyak main teen talaak ke doshi muslim purushon ko teen saal kii jail kii sajaa ke kade praavdhaan par vyaavhaarik drushtikon apanaae jane ko lekar he, jise abhi bhi sarkaar ne vaise hi rakhaa he
 Senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha said that Nitish Kumar should not call Narendra Modi 'communal'
 unhone yah bhi kaha, 'nitish kumaar ko modi kaa virodh bhi nahin karnaa chahie
 If he wants to leave the NDA, then the party will let him go
 'india today sarveh piem pad ke liye narendra modi sabase ageendie sarkaar main vitt mantri rahe sinha ne kaha ki agar jadyu endie ko se khud ko alag karti he to uske baad bijepi apana rasta khud tay karegi
 Advocating Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi as PM candidate, Yashwant Sinha said that Narendra Modi should be declared the prime ministerial candidate

 ye kaaryakarta dukaanon main ja jaakar saikadon kii taadaad main is tarah ke cap baantate najar aae
 Although they are not for free, a cup is worth fifty paise

 After this, BJP leaders were also seen giving tea to people from this cup

 lekin sutara kii maane to dilli bijepi har vidhansabha main kai hajaar cap batwane kii koshish main lagi he
 Actually, BJP wants that anyone who takes a cup of tea in Delhi during the election should take it from this cup and then maybe the vote also goes to the bjp's account

 Surrey's team does not have very big names among the local players

 Moin and Vox also rejected the notion that the Indian captain was aggressive and awe-inspiring
 moin ne kaha, ‘aap use maidan par dekhte ho or log dharna bana lete hai ki vah ghamandi he, lekin vah uske thik vipareet he
 He is a very humble and nice person

 The CBI then announced
 baaten hui thim
 The letter was also written and all the efforts were done to stop the torrent of Ganga
 lekin vahiin nahin kiya jisaki sabase zyada jarurat thi
 That is, the need to dig the grave and remove the corpses
 phir khyaal aayaa, lekin tab tak bahut der ho chuki thi
 The entire investigation had gone into the water along with the dead bodies
 ji haa, ham baat kar rahe hai us badaayun cese kii jisamen do bahanon ko maar kar ped par taang diya gaya tha
 Where it was decided that the CBI would get the dead bodies of both the sisters who were victims of gang rape and get them post-mortem again, and where the bodies were removed, reaching the corpses is also going to be a problem for the CBI
 us par garaj ye ki jis teji se ganga ne in kabron ko apni agosh main liya he, uske baad sibiai to kya soobe kaa flud management department yani baadh khand vibhaag bhi kabron tak pahunch paane ke maamle main apane haath khadey kar chukaa he
 Now the situation is that in the coming few days, it is almost impossible for the two sisters to dig out the corpses for the next two-three months
 darasal, badaayun ke is charchit gangrape maamle kii jaanch sibiai ke hawaale kiye jane ke saath hi desh kii is premier jaanch agency ne laashon ko dobaaraa kabr se nikaal kar postmortem karwaane kaa elaan kar diya tha
 This is the matter of July 9 and since then the CBI used to say and just keep saying
 puure das dinon ke baad yani 19 july ko jab sibiai ganga nadi ke kinare bane in kabron kii khudaai ke liye pahunchi tab tak sabakuch badal chukaa tha
 The graves were buried in deep water seven-eight feet in the waves of the Ganges, and as the CBI arranged for the extraction of water from these corpses, more water would be filled around these graves
 das dinon tak kya karti rahi sibiai?sibiai ke aage kii kavayad kii puri ram kahani aapako tafsil se bataaen, usase pehle ye jaan lete hai ki 9 july se lekar 19 july tak yani puure das din tak desh kii sabase badi jaanch agency aakhir kya karti rahi? kis tarah ek ahm cese kii jaanch main deree kii gai
 The need to get the corpse out of the tomb arose because questions were raised about whether the two sisters had been raped or not
 lekin postmormatom ke liye medical board bithaane main hi aath dinon kaa vakt jaaya kar diya gaya or 17 july ko jab medical board taiyaar hua, tab tak kudarat apana kaam kar chaki thi
 When it was announced that the CBI would be investigated in the Badaun gangrape case wrapped in a sheet of mystery, it was felt that the curtain would be removed from the face of the guilty
 lekin ab laashon ko baahar nikaalnaa to dur un tak pahunchnaa bhi mushkil he
 In such a situation, how is the CBI going to punish the guilty without strong forensic evidence? sibiai ko thi har baat kii jaankarisibiai ko ground level kii hakeekat kii puri jaankaree thi
 Not only this, he was also well aware that the bodies of the two sisters were buried at a place on the banks of the river Ganges, which falls in the catchment area of the river and the area is completely submerged every year during the rainy days
 lekin sibiai ne jaldi se kabron kii khudaai kar laashen nikaalane kii bajaay duusare sarkari mahakamon ke saath khaton-kitabon kaa khel khelnaa hi munasib samajha
 First wrote a letter to the DM to make safety arrangements for the excavation and then also agreed with the Narora Dam Management to prevent release of Ganga water
 lekin itnaa hone ke baavjood wo maukey par pahunchane kii jahamat nahin uthaa saki
 On the other hand, DM said that if the graves were not drowned due to early excavation, Narora Dam also cleared the CBI by giving 24 hours time if it did not remove the dead bodies in such a time, then water for dam management It will be difficult to stop
 sibiai kii kahili kaa kamaal dekhie ki use maukey par pahunchakar laashen nikalava lene kaa khyaal nahin aayaa
 She kept making plans to reach Badaun comfortably
 19 july ko jab sibiai kii team pehali baar puure lavajme ke saath yahaan pahunchi, tab tak vakt badal chukaa tha
 There was water on the dry land
 kabr 9 feet pani ke neeche samaa chuke the
 When all was over in the water, the CBI along with the flood block department tried to stop the water stream by pouring hundreds of sand sacks along the Ganges
 do-do tubewel laga kar pani nikaala jaataa rahaa
 But what happened was to happen
 idhar, ek taraf se pani niklaa, duusari taraf se dugana pani kabron main bhar jaataa
 As a result, the first day went absolutely waste
 afasar apane-apane hotalon or sarkari guest houseon main waapas chale gaye
 The sand sacks were also submerged in water when they reached the spot again the next day
 wo to ganimat thi ki sibiai ne kabron kii nishandehi ke taur par ek jhanda sa gaad diya tha isliye kabron kii pahchaan ho saki
 Now the CBI has started measuring the blaze on one side of the tree on which the corpses were hanging, on the other hand, the family members were questioned for hours long
 lekin in tamaam kavayad ke bich ek sawaal jo jas kaa tas rah gaya wo ye ki agar sibiai is maamle kaa sach pataa bhi kar le to bhi bagaiyr laashon or bina pukhta forensik avidence ke kya wo gunahagaaron ko sajaa dilava paaegi? The phones of 2 mps who reached Nigam Bodh Ghat to attend the funeral of former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley have been stolen

 Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Saturday claimed at the United Nations that the stamps issued by his country's postal department a few months ago show human rights abuses in Kashmir
 in stamp kopakistanki ore se ‘bharat adhikrut kashmir main atyaachaar’ kaa sheershak diya gaya tha
 The Pakistan Foreign Office said in a press release that India canceled talks with India at the United Nations citing these stamps
 india today fact check team ne pakistan kii ore se inastampmen istemaal kii gai 20 tasveeron kii padtaal me paaya ki kam se kam do tasveeron main jhooth kaa sahaara lekar pakistan ne duniya ko gumraah karne kii koshish kii
 On 13 July 2018, Pakistan's postal department issued 20 postage stamps naming the alleged 'kashmir Martyr's Day'
 isepakistani mediamein bhi khub kawarej diya gaya

 com / cjalsevg1u— Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga (@tajinderbagga)september 30, 2018bagga ke mutabik ye tasviir dilli ke jantar mantar par 19 janvari ko visthapit kashmiri panditon ke dharne kii thi
 Kashmiri Pandits gave this protest on the anniversary of being forced to leave their homes in Kashmir in large numbers
 india today kii fact check team ne pakistan dak vibhaag kii ore se stamp main istemaal kii gai tasveeron ke sach tak pahunchane kaa faisla kiya
 Taking a clue from Bagga's claim, we started searching the news reports on the Internet under the keywords "kashmiri Pandits protest at Jantar Mantar"
 aisi kai reports milin jinamein uparokt tasviir (jise bagga ne apane twit ke saath share kiya tha) kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 This picture was of the dharna done at Jantar Mantar in Delhi on the anniversary of the large number of Kashmiri Pandits fleeing in 1990
 pakistan ne is tasviir kaa istemaal ‘laapata log’ ke sheershak ke saath kiya tha
 This picture can also be seen on Kogeti Images
 geti ne is tasviir kaa credit ‘hindustan times’ ko diya he
 And the date of its drawing is also mentioned on 19 January 2014 in the title of the picture
 hindustan times ke photographer sonu mehta ne india today se pushti karte hue kaha ki ye tasviir unhone 19 janvari 2014 ko jantar mantar par kashmiri panditon ke dharna dene ke dauraan lee thi
 Pakistan has used another photograph showing some children sitting
 iskaa sheershak diya gaya he- ‘beghar bachche'india today kii fact check team ne jab internet par kiwards ‘’kashmiri children sitting and crying” ke saath search kii to is tasviir kaa asli sach bhi saamne aa gaya
 Along with this picture, several such news reports were found mentioning the heinous incident of killing of 36 Sikhs in March 2000 in Chhattisinghpora near Srinagar
 BBC ne ghatana ko is sheershak ke saath report kiya tha- ‘sikhon kaa kashmir main sanhaar’
 The report was accompanied by a picture of crying children, which Pakistan used in its stamp
 chhattisinghpora main sikhon kii hatya kathith taur par lashkar aatankwaadiyon ne kii thi jo bhartiya sena kii vardi pahan kar vahaan aae the
 (you can read this news by clicking on this link) The fact check team's investigation revealed that the stamp on which Pakistan gave the title of 'missing people' was taken not at Kashmir but at Jantar Mantar in Delhi
 isi tarah jis tasviir par ‘beghar bachche’ kaa sheershak pakistan ne diya wo ghati main sikhon par lashkar-e-taiyaba ke hamale ke baad kii thi
 It is clear that Pakistan tried to mislead the world by falsely citing these pictures
 bataa den ki beete saal sanyukt raashtra main pakistan kii rajdoot maleeha lodhi ne UNGA main ek philistini ladki kii tasviir ye kah kar pesh kar di thi ki wo pellette gan kii peedit kashmiri ladki he

 daliton ke mudde par baikfoot par chal rahi bijepi is baar rakshabandhan ko aise maukey ke taur par dekh rahi he, jo use votbank kii taraf le jaae
 For this, the Sangh is fully involved in planning
 sangh or bijepi ne milakar rakshabandhan par daliton or sainikon ko najadik laane kaa puraa khaakaa taiyaar kar liya he
 Organizations close to the Sangh have given a slogan to link Vishwabandhuva to the thread of Rakhi

 In such a situation, not only came a statement from the Sangh to stand with the Dalits, but the Prime Minister himself also made a noise
 kendriya mahila mantri sainikon ko baandhengi rakhibat sirf daliton tak hi simit nahin he
 The BJP has also planned to go to the soldiers who are stationed on the border away from their families after completing 70 years of independence
 party ne apni mahila mantriyon kii duty lagaai he, jo in sainikon ke saath raksha bandhan kaa tyohaar manaaengi
 For this, Textile Minister Smriti Irani will go to Siachen, then Maneka will go to the Punjab border and tie rakhi to the soldiers
 bijepi netaa bhi baandhenge rakhiraksha bandhan ke 4 din baad bijepi netaa kendriya mantri vankeya naidu ke ghar jutenge or ek duusare ko raakhi baandhenge
 In this program, apart from Sangh leader Bhaiyyaji Joshi, many officials will also be present, who will tell BJP leaders the Sangh's view on all the issues
 ek nae adhyayanmen daawa kiya gaya he ki prajnan sambandhi injection bacchon main janm se judi vikrutiyon kaa kaaran ban sakate hai
 The University of Adelaide made this claim after studying over 300,000 children
 adhyayan main kaha gaya he ki prakritik tareeke se janme bacchon kii tulana main un bacchon main vikrutiyaan hone kaa khatra adhik hota he, jinka janm prajnan sambandhi ilaaj ke saamaanya tareeke se hota he
 The news published in 'the Daily Telegraph' said that children born with 'intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection' (ICSI) are more prone to malformations
 isiesai main ek shukranu ko sidhe hi andanu main pravisht karaayaa jaataa he
 This means that sperm can also fertilize the egg which is abnormal
 saamaanya prakriya main aisa shukranu alag kar diya jaataa he
 However, researchers have not been able to tell if the risk of such malformations increases with the ICSI technique, or that males with more damaged sperm are more likely to have genetic disorders
 adhyayan main yah bhi paaya gaya ki paramparaagat in vrito fertiligeshan (ivief) ilaaj se janm sambandhi vikrutiyon kaa khatra nahin badhata
 The results of the study have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine

 unhone kaha ki sarkaar har saal ek karod bacchon ko aplication ke jariye chunegi or unamem se 20 hajaar bacchon ko chhaantkar unka diene test kiya jayega or bhavishya main aage badhane ke liye unhen salanaa 5 lakh rupee kii raashi bhi di jaaegi
 He said that it is a specialty of our government to have a ministry, there are experts on the particular policy that is made in it, the ministers of other ministry are also consulted
 2014 main shuru hui target olympic podium hamaari hi sarkaar kii thi, mantri chaahe koi bhi ho wo sarkaar kaa faisla tha
 Rathore said that within the last four years, the Target Olympic Podium has reached such a point that we first separated those who are elite athletes
 saath hi jo achche khilaadi hai unhen bhi alag kiya
 Elite athletes began receiving separate funding from 2014
 wo duniya ke jis coach par ungali rakhen, jis desh par wo ungali rakhen vahaan par unhen bheja jaataa he, paise kii koi kami nahin he
 This tradition has gone on
 target olympic podium main hamane bahut aage badhkar 50 hajaar rupee tak funding dena shuru kiya ki khilaadiyon ko apane mata-pita se na lenaa pade
 Having said that this is your pocket allowance which is different from training and other things
 har saal hoga 20 hajaar bacchon kaa sellectionunhone kaha ki khelo india main 16-17 saal ke khilaadi aae
 From this year onwards, we will start taking tests for 8-10 year olds across the country
 ek aplication ke madhyam se, schools ke madhyam se or parents ke madhyam se ham wo basic test karnaa shuru karenge
 Under this, we will test one crore children every year
 usamen se ham 20 hajaar bacchon ko chhaantenge, unki diene testing karaayenge, aikyuu test karaayenge
 So that we also know how tall that 8 year old child will be
 kitna dam uske paanv main he
 He can become a volleyball player, play tennis or any other sport, he will be able to evaluate it
 iske tahat 8 saal kii umr par ham 8 saal tak bachche ko 5 lakh prati varsh dena shuru karenge
 In such a situation, when that child reaches the age of 16, at that time when he will not get any sponsorship then the Government of India will sponsor him
 'pramukh coach hi nahin, primary coach ko bhi milegaa paisa'rajyavardhan ne aage kaha ki guru kii bhoomika jivan main behad mahatvapurn hoti he or khelon ke andar coach to hote hi hai
 Till now, only those coaches who were at the top level were given incentives, who won the Olympic medal, who won the Asian Games
 lekin unhen koi nahin poochta tha jo medal jeetne vaale athlet ko sabase pehle khoja tha
 Rajyavardhan said, "we changed the policy and now it will also get 20 percent money
" matlab saaf he ki ab medal jeetne vaale khilaadi ke apeks coach ko 50 fisadi fund milegaa or us khilaadi ko primary main khojane vaale coach ko 20 fisadi paisa diya jayega
 Apart from this, 30 per cent of the money will be given to the coach who will be policing those children from primary to middle school
 har level par har coach kii mahatvapurn bhoomika hoti he
 Our decision will change the tradition of the game

 He, along with Gambhir, gave India a stormy start

 The film released today is 'commando 2'
 is film kaa nirdesan deven bhojani ne kiya he or iske kai nirmaataaon main se ek nirmaataa vipul shah hai
 The film stars Vidyut Jamwal, Ada Sharma, Freddy Daruwala, Isha Gupta, Thakur Anoop Singh, Satish Kaushik and Adil Hussain in the lead roles
 film 'commando 2' kii kahani videshi dharti se bharat kaa kaala dhan waapas laane par aadhaarit he
 If a team of four is formed for this mission, Malaysia goes to bring the person, who is the biggest mafia of money laundering
 isi shaks kii madad se desh ke kai bhrasht logon ne kaala dhan malaysia main jamaa karaayaa he
 The reasoning is that by holding it all will be returned
 kahani kaa saar to yahi he baaki vidyut jamwaal kaa ection dekhne ke liye aapako cinemagharon kaa rukh karnaa hoga
 Now let's talk about the merits and demerits of this film, which will make it even easier for you to decide whether you should watch this film or not
 khaamiyon kii baat karen to is film kii sabase badi khami he isaki script kyonki kahani choti he jise 2 ghante kii film main failaane main team naakaam rahi he
 If you look at a few scenes or dialogues, the film runs on the old pattern
 vahiin film ke ection seens achche to hai lekin itane lambey hai ki iske khatm hone kaa aap intjaar karenge
 Stories of different characters may also make you feel boring
 film kaa becoground music shor machaata he
 At the same time, the biggest feature of the film's merits is the film's hero Vidyut Jamwal, who has been taking martial arts training for 3 years and his action appears on the screen
 vidyut apana ection khud dizin karte hai or film main unke digind seens bhi asardaar hai
 You will also like his dialogue delivery in many places in the film
 vahiin film main fredy daruvala, isha gupta kaa abhinay asardaar he
 i also liked the climax of the film
 bharat ke pradhanmantri ne janata se vaada kiya tha ki videsh main chupe kaale dhan ko waapas laaenge or garibon ke bank acount main jamaa karaayenge
 'commando-2' will connect you to this and maybe some people will find this film impressive
 meri ore se film ko 2
 Get 5 stars
 ab is film kii khoobiyon or khaamiyon kii baat karte hai, jisase aapke liye yah faisla karnaa or bhi aasaan ho jayega ki aapako yah film dekhni chahie yaa nahin
 Talking about the flaws, the biggest flaw of this film is its script because the story is short which the team has failed to spread in a 2-hour film
 chand seens yaa dialog dekhen to film zaraa puraane dharre par chalati he
 At the same time the action scenes of the film are good but are so long that you will wait for it to end
 alag-alag kirdaaron kii kahaniyaan bhi aapako ubaau lag sakati hai
 The background music of the film makes a noise
 vahiin film kii khoobiyon main sabase badi khubi hai film ke hero vidyut jamwaal, jo 3 saal se marshall arts kii training le rahe hai or parde par unka ye ection ubhar kar najar aata he
 Vidyut designs his own action and his designed scenes are also effective in the film
 film main kai jagah unki dialog delivery bhi aapako acchhee lagegi
 At the same time, Freddy Daruwala and Isha Gupta's performance in the film is effective
 mujhe film kaa clymex bhi acha laga
 The Prime Minister of India promised the public to bring back the black money hidden abroad and deposit it in the bank account of the poor
 'commando-2' aapako isse jodygi or ho saktaa he kuch logon ko ye film prabhaavshaalee lage
 Film 2 from me 5 stars milte hai

 film kaa naam: sonu ke titu kii sweetydiarector: lav ranjanster cast: karthik aryan, nushrat bharucha, sani singh, alok nath, virendra saxentvadhi: 2 ghanta 20 minutesrtificate: u / aretimga: 3
 When 5-star producer Luv Ranjan made Pyaar Ka Panchnama film, a different kind of sensation had spread in the country
 log film kii tarif ke pul baandhe ja rahe the
 After that Love made Akash Vani film which was rejected by the audience and then the audience of Pyaar Ka Panchanama 2i was appreciated
 ab karthik aryan, nushrat bharucha or sani singh ke saath lav ne yah nai film banaai he
 Will you be able to hear and watch big monologues again, will it be fun to see the fight between boy and girl once again? This is the story of Sonu's Titu's sweetie
 Video: nashe kii giraft se ubarkar hani singh ne gaaya- chote-chote paig
 
 
 The story begins with a joint family in Delhi, where Sonu (karthik Aryan) and Tito (sunny Singh) have lived together since childhood
 sonu apane bhai titu kaa sabase zyada khyaal rakhata he or wo titu ko hameshaa sahi salaah bhi detaa rahata he
 One day Tito gets a breakup with his girlfriend Pihu (ishita Raj Sharma), then Sonu accompanies him
 kuch dinon ke baad titu ke gharavaale uski shaadi ke liye ladki dekhne jate hai
 The girl's name is Sweety (nushrat Bharucha), who wants to get Titu at any cost
 sweety kii vajah se titu or sani ke bich pyaar kam hone lagata he
 To avoid this situation, Sonu fights a few tricks and a lot of twist turns occur
 ab sonu or sweety main se titu kisko sabase zyada pyaar karata he, iskaa pataa aapako film dekhakar hi chalegaa
 Honey Singh returned from quitting alcohol addiction, sang- Daru chali hai to jaaye jaaye kya jaaye kar hoon
 is film ke trailor main hi spasht kar diya gaya tha ki ladki or dost main hameshaa ladki hi jitati he
 The entire film has been based on this concept
 film main diarection, cinemetography, loketions jabardast hai
 The dialogues in the film have been wonderfully written and attempts have been made to show the controversies in the family environment
 karthik aryan ne sonu ke kirdaar main jabardast acting kii he to sani singh ne titu kaa kirdaar badhiya nibhaayaa he or nushrat bharucha kaa kirdaar kaaphi mushkil tha lekin unhone free flo acting kamaal kii kii he
 Weak Link The weak link of the film is its editing and songs which make the film's pace weak
 vahiin film kaa clymex or bhi zyada behatar kiya ja saktaa tha
 The film would have been even more crisp if it had been shortened by about 15 minutes
 box offisfilm kaa bajet lagbhag 24 karod bataaya ja rahaa he jisamen production cost 14 karod or 10 karod kaa promotional cost he
 The film has already been sold to Amazon Prime as digital rights

 rajyasabha sadsy amar singh ke vakil ram jethmalani ne somvaar ko dilli kii ek adaalat ke samaksh 2008 ke note ke badale vot maamle main dhan ke strot ke taur par congress netaa ahamed patel kaa naam liya
 While pleading for bail for Singh, a former Samajwadi Party leader, the senior advocate took away Patel's name from his earlier statement today
 pehle jethmalani ne kaha tha ki bhaajapa ne dhan diya ho saktaa he, kyonki laalkrishna adwani ne kaha tha ki unki party ne sting oparation karaayaa tha
 Jethmalani said before Special Judge Sangeeta Dhingra Sehgal that a bribe was given at the Lee Meridian Hotel
 unhone kaha, rishwat lenden kaa sthaan amar singh kaa awaas nahin tha, balki lee meredian hotel tha
 The bribe man was not Amar Singh, but apparently Ahmed Patel, who is an MP and a very influential leader of the party whose government was to be saved
 patel ko rishwat dene vaala bataate hue jethmalani ne kaha, main yah nahin kah rahaa ki is sakshya ke aadhaar par patel ko doshi tehraaya janaa chahie, lekin yadi aap apni party kii ore se anya dalon ke saansadon ko prabhavit kar rahe hai, to aap rishwat dene vaale kehlaayenge
 Earlier, on 12 September, Jethmalani, while pleading on behalf of Amar Singh, had said that the bundles of notes that were hoisted during the vote-for-vote scam in the Lok Sabha may have come from the BJP
 us din jethmalani ne adaalat main kaha tha, yadi bhaajapa saansadon ne note laharaae, to dhan bhaajapa kii ore se aayaa ho saktaa he
 i am not in favor of anyone's case
 unhone kaha, is tarah kaa koi aarope nahin he ki amar singh ne dhan kaa bandobast kiya tha
 While registering a protest against Jethmalani's pleas in the court, Patel said, "this is all baseless and nonsense and i have already clarified this"
 amar singh ko jamaanat par jor dete hue jethmalani ne aaj adaalat main kaha ki unke khilaaf prathamdrishtya koi maamla nahin he
 He also argued that Amar Singh's interim bail should be increased on health grounds, as his client's medical reports from AIIMS require constant monitoring
 singh ko 6 sitambar ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha

 ) 26 november1949 ko hamaari samvidhansabha ne bharat ke samvidhan ko antim rup diya tha
 Therefore, we celebrate this day as Constitution Day
 tab se lekar ajtak yah samvidhan hamaare desh kii raajnneeti ko taulne kaa atuly maapdand rahaa he
 Even after 70 years, this constitution will remain relevant, in 1949 only a very optimistic person could have imagined it
 akhirkaar, america professor ginsburg, elkins or melton ne vishwavyaapee samvidhanon ke surveykshan main paaya ki ek samvidhan kii ausatan umr keval 19 saal hoti he
 Their research also found that age-old constitutions protect constitutional values (such as democracy and fundamental rights) better than new constitutions
 samvidhanon ke visheshgy yah bhi maanate hai ki sanvaidhanik sthirataa kaa sidhaa sambandh saamaajik sthirataa se he- sanvaidhanik kranti aksar raajnneetik uthal-puthal or vyapak saamaajik hinsa protsaahit karti he
 In this context, the old age of the Indian Constitution is an exception
 samvidhan to sirf kagaz ke pannon par likhe hue kuch shabdon ke sangrah hote hai
 Those who wrote them have also passed away
 phir dabang rajaneta, banduukon or texon vaali military, rais udyogpati, agrim saamaajik varg aadi taqatvar hone ke baavjood kyon ek kitaab ke saamne ghutane tekte he (chaahe unki shraddha dikhaawati hi kyon na ho)? ek kitaab se kaisaa dar? gita-quran-bible to phir bhi daivik vaidyata kaa daawa kar sakate hai, ek samvidhan to purnatah insaani kriti he
 Then why constitutionalism flourished in India? The constitutional faith of some people, especially Dalits, may be related to the role of Babasaheb Ambedkar
 unki vyavhaarik doordarshita nishchit taur par hamaare samvidhan main dikhaai padati he
 But why should those who do not have this personal faith, obey this constitution? To understand this, we have to understand the meaning of constitutionalism
 ek vividh samaaj main jab naanaa prakaar ke log ek saath rahete hon, to saamaajik matbhed nishchit taur par ubharenge
 When there are differences of opinion, how are social decisions taken? Basically, there are only two options in front of such a society - violence or politics
 yaa to ham ek duusare se ladakar yah dekhen ki koun jeetta he or usee kii baat maane, yaa ham ek duusare ke mat ko raajnneetik bahes ke dwaara samajhane kii koshish karke koi samjhaute kii kaamana karen
 The specialty of agreements is that everyone is unhappy with them - no one gets everything according to his or her own mind, but no one goes empty handed
 samvidhanwaad kaa buniyadi usul he hinsa par raajnneeti kii praathamikta
 The attempt of a successful constitution is to give comfort to every section that it is more likely to flourish in constitutional politics than in violent ways
 raveesh kumaar kaa blog: 95,000 karod ke aaropee ko modi ne bana diya maharashtra kaa up mukhyamantrisamaajik virgon ko yah tasalli tabhi mil sakati he jab sanvaidhanik maapdand aapasi samjhauton par aadhaarit hon
 The root cause of the success of the Indian Constitution is that in our Constituent Assembly, there was an attempt to give representation to every small and big sections of Indian society
 samvidhan ke daayre lagbhag teen saal lambi bahes or sainkadon chote-bade samjhauton ke zariye, na ki kisi nirankush netaa yaa varg-vishesh kii pasand ke mutabik, tay hue
 The Congress party had a majority, yet invited many opposition leaders to the Constituent Assembly
 khud baba ambedkar dashakon se pandit nehru ke raajnneetik virdohi thea, phir bhi ve samvidhansabha kii aalekhan samiti ke adhyaksh niyukt hue
 The country had seen the result of the violence that followed the Partition
 us peedi ne yah samaj liya tha ki bharat jaise vividhta vaale desh main hinsa kaa ekmaatr vikalp samjhaute-vaali loktantrik raajnneeti hi ho sakati he
 Everyone listened
 kisi ko bhi sab kuch manachaaha nahin mila- khud pradhanmantri nehru ke kai mat samvidhan main pratibimbit nahin hue
 Dr
 Ambedkar also had to compromise on many of his demands
 par samvidhansabha ne kisi ko bhi khaali haath nahin bheja
 Everyone was given a consolation - if not today, tomorrow, if not here, you can also be ruling in this system
 aaj kaa haara kal jeet bhi saktaa he
 Their power will neither be yours nor yours forever
 kisi ek samay main bhi, satta kii sari shakti ek insaan yaa sanstha main nahin, balki kai vibhinn kendriya or rajya-str kii sansthaaon main baant di gayi, taaki koi kisi or par haaavee na ho sake
 Some weaker or minority sections — such as Dalits, tribes, Kashmiris, northeastern states, etc
 — who were experiencing some degree of uneasiness with the coming majority politics - were given specific promises to bring them under the Constitution
 swytt sanvaidhanik sansthaaen (udharantah supreme court, auditor general, ellection kamishan aadi) sthapit kii gayin taaki ve samvidhanwaad kii chaukeedaari kar saken
 Finally, even in such a diverse Constituent Assembly, only one member refused to sign India's constitutional document
 baaki sabhi sadsy- chaahe ve udaaravaadi rahe hon yaa gandhivadi, dakshinpanthi the yaa samaajawaadee, hindu the yaa musalmaan, mard bhi or aurat bhi- sabhi ne is samvidhan par hastakshar kar iske aadhaar par ek nae mulk kii rachana karne kaa sankalp liya

 Last year too, this video was shared as the residence of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 us samayalt newjane is bhraamak post ko khaarij kiya tha
 Bollywood's brilliant actor Manoj Bajpayee expressed his displeasure at the Filmfare Award list in a tweet on Wednesday
 manoj ne twit main kaha, "meri filmon ko rashtriya or antarrashtriya str par saraahaa jaataa he
 But the nomination list of the mainstream award does not find a place
 " manoj ne 2018 main ai apni film "gali guliyaan" kaa poster bhi share kiya
 This tweet by Manoj Bajpayee came just after the release of the 64th Filmfare Award nomination list
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki unhone filmphere awords par naaraazgi main ye twit kiya he
 However Manoj Bajpayee has not named the film fair in his tweet
 bataate chalem ki is baar film fere aword ke liye best film category main, andhaadhun, badhai ho, padmavat, raji, stri or sanju ko jagah di gai he
 Akshay Kumar (padman), Ayushman Khurana (andhadhun), Rajkumar Rao (stree), Ranbir Kapoor (sanju), Ranveer Singh (padmaavat), Shah Rukh Khan (zero) have been nominated for Best Film Actor
 So used to the fact that all the films of mine which are highly acclaimed nationally and internationally don’t even get a place in the nominations list of so called big mainstream awards here forget about winning
 creative pursuit and exploitation continue
