 Her character in this film is that of a girl who travels from item girl to politics

 Remind you that even businessmen cannot withdraw more than 50,000 a week from a current account
 aam aadmi 24000 se adhik nahin nikaal saktaa to in logon ke paas 76 lakh ke nae note kahaan se aa gaye
 Surely people have been caught with new notes in ten or twenty incidents but if many people have succeeded in doing so then it is unfair to the common man who takes three-three days in line for two thousand new notes
 
 yah ghatnaayen bataa rahi hai ki system main itani badi maatra main nae noton ko hasil karnaa bahut mushkil nahin he
 Whether these new notes have been replaced by old ones or on whose request they have been given so much amount
 iskar vibhaag kii jaanch main sabit karne main to maheenon lag jaaenge lekin is vakt jab aam aadmi pareshaan he kya use jaanane kaa haq nahin he ki kaise kuch logon ke haath main itani badi maatra main nae note aae hai

 This amount is telling that some people have not had any problem in getting millions of new notes
 anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki jo log pakade nahin gaye hai unki sankhya kya hogi or unhone is system kaa laabh kis tarah se uthaaya hoga
 All this has happened when the public is guarding outside the banks
 khayr ham sab yah khabaren pard rahe hai
 Flash is also investigating whether the money was recovered or confiscated in the raid

 aapako yaad dilaa den ki bijnesaman bhi curent account se hafte main 50,000 se adhik nahin nikaal sakate
 If the common man cannot withdraw more than 24000, then from where did these people get 76 lakh new notes
 jarur das-bees ghatnaon main log nae noton ke saath pakade gaye hai lekin agar aisa karne main bahut se log safal hue hai to yah aam aadmi ke saath ninsaphi he jo do hajaar ke nae note ke liye teen-teen din ghanton line main lagata he
 These incidents are suggesting that it is not very difficult to get such large amount of new notes in the system
 kya yah nae note puraane noton ko badal kar die gaye hai yaa kiske kehane par inhen itani raashi di gai he
 It will take months to prove in the Income Tax Department's investigation, but at this time when the common man is upset, does he not have the right to know how such a large amount of new notes have come in the hands of some people

 sibiai banaam kolkata police vivaad par pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee (CBI vs Mamata Banerjee)ke samarthan main aane ke liye vipaksh par hamalaa bolte hue kendriya mantri arun jetali (arun Jaitley) ne kaha ki 'choron kaa tantra' desh kii satta par kabiz hone kaa icchhuk he
 Union Minister Arun Jaitley said that the 'excessive response' given by Banerjee over the investigation of the Kolkata Police Chief of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has raised many issues of public debate
 saath hi unhone kaha, 'inamen se sabase mahatvapurn yah he ki choron kaa tantra ab desh kii satta par kabja karnaa chahta he
 In a post titled 'the Kleptocrat's Club' on Facebook, Jaitley said that the West Bengal Chit Fund scam surfaced in 2012-13
 isaki jaanch ucchtam nyaayalay ne sibiai ko saunp di thi
 Jaitley questioned, 'the court supervised such an investigation
 sibiai ne poochtacha kii or yahaan tak ki kuch logon ko giraftaar bhi kiya
 Many people got bail
 agar poochtacha ke liye police ke ek adhikari kii jarurat padati he to yah 'super immergency' , 'sanghavaad par hamalaa' yaa 'sansthaanon kii barbaadi'? kaise ho jaataa he
 ”mamata Banerjee's disproportionate over-reaction to the CBI wanting to interrogate the Kolkata Police Chief has flagged several issues for a public discourse
 The most important being that a Kleptocrat's Club now aspires to capture the reigns of India
 He said it would be a colossal mistake to understand that Banerjee did this because a police officer was brought under regular scrutiny, but rather, "he did so to divert attention from other ambitious leaders of the opposition for the highest post and himself Used to show at the center of opposition
 ” sharada (sarada) sahit anya chit fund ghotaalon main shahar police pramukh se poochtacha karne ke sibiai ke prayaas ke khilaaf banerjee ravivaar se kolkata main dharna par baithi hui hai
 Arun Jaitley said, "today, the CBI in West Bengal was stopped by force and an officer was not allowed to legally investigate a crime within his jurisdiction
 yah sanghavaad par rajya sarkaar ke hamale kaa mul chithran he
 He said that Banerjee's decision to sit on the dharna has got the support of many opposition parties who aspire to come to power
 unhone kaha ki inamen se zyaadaatar kii bhrashtachar ke maamle main jaanch kii ja rahi he, mukadmaa chalaaya ja rahaa he or kuch maamalon main kuch ko doshi bhi tehraaya ja chukaa he
 Jaitley said, "the 2019 elections will be Modi vs Chaos or Modi vs Chaos
 mamata banerjee kaa haalia naatak is baat kaa sabase acha saboot he ki bharat kaa vipaksh kaisaa sushasan de saktaa he
 " dilli or ensiaar main pataakhon kii kharid farokht or supplai par roak lagane kii maang vaali yachika par supreme court ne faisla surakshit rakh liya he
 It is being told that a decision can be taken on this petition on Monday
 is faisle main supreme court simit license jari karne ke apane pichley aadesh main badlaav bhi kar saktaa he
 The court had approved the sale of 5 million kilograms of firecrackers during Diwali Chhath and Guruparva to the national capital region including Delhi
 iske alaava dilli or ensiaar main kisi bhi duusare rajya se pataakhen laane par bhi roak laga di thi
 Also, in its decision, the court can decide whether to increase the number of firecrackers' licenses or whether the temporary license holder should be allowed to sell the firecrackers
 shuukravaar ko maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan pataakhaa vyapaariyon kii taraf se kaha gaya ki court apane simit roak vaale pichley aadesh main sanshodhan kar den
 Firecrackers said in the Supreme Court that 50 lakh kg of firecrackers would fall only for 10% of the population of Delhi and NCR
 isliye rajasthan, haryana or madhyapradesh jaise rajyon ke kaarigaron ke haathon se bane pataakhe bikri ke liye laane kii ijaajat di jaae
 Traders also argued that according to government regulations, their warehouse is outside the outskirts of Delhi, so it should be allowed to bring firecrackers from NCR to Delhi
 asthaayee pataakhaa license holder kii taraf se daleel kii gai ki wo pichley 40 saalon se vyapaar kar rahe hai or court ke aadesh ke baad unka dhandha chaupat ho gaya he
 In such a situation, they should be allowed to set up temporary shops only for a few days
 pataakhaa vyapaariyon kii taraf se daleel kii gai ki diwaali ke baad badhate vaayu pradooshan ke liye keval pataakhen jimmedaar nahin he balki isaki mukhya vajah kisaanon dwaara paraai jalaana or dilli ensiaar main badhata trephic he
 At the same time, it was argued on behalf of the petitioner that after the last Diwali, there was no such mist in the history as firecrackers
 pahari ilaakon main dhumrapaan karne vaale 52 saal ke aadmi ke fefdon se zyada dilli main bina dhumrapaan karne vaale kaa fefda pradooshan kii vajah se kaala hota he
 Delhi is one of the most polluted cities in the world, so the sale of court firecrackers should be completely banned
 yachikakarta ne supreme court main daleel di ki sharaab or cigarette banane waalon kii jaan nahin jaati, jabaki pataakhon kii factory main kaam karne waalo kii jaan aksar chali jaati he
 Children work extensively in the firecracker factory
 yachikakarta ne supreme court se kaha ki keval is diwaali main pataakhon kii bikri par roak lagane sevaayu pradooshanmen kaaphi sudhaar milegaa
 The CPCB said that they support the petition seeking a ban on the sale of firecrackers in Delhi and NCR
 darasal yachika main supreme court se guhaar lagaai gai he ki court apane us aadesh ko waapas len, jisamen court ne sharton ke saath dilli or ensiaar main pataakhon kii bikri par lagi roak hataai thi
 Earlier, Justice Madan B
 Lokur had disassociated himself from the hearing and sent it to the Chief Justice to set up a second bench for hearing the case
 darasalsupreme court ne dilli or ensiaar main pataakhon kii bikriper lagi roak supreme court ne kuch sharton ke saath hataai thi
 The Supreme Court had said that licenses should be given for the sale of firecrackers in Delhi under the supervision of the police
 zyada se zyada 500 asthai license hi die ja sakenge
 The court has said that only 50 per cent of the licenses granted in 2016 should be granted this time
 is baar yahi niyam ensiaar main bhi lagu kiya jayega, yani 2016 main die gaye license ke aadhe hi isbaar die jaaenge
 The Supreme Court has directed that firecrackers will not be burnt within 100 meters of the silence zone
 yani aspataal, court, dharmik sthal or skool aadi ke 100 meter ke daayre main pataakhe na chalem
 Apart from this, there is a directive not to use lithium, lead, mercury, antimony and arsenic in making crackers

 With a 9-wicket defeat against Rising Pune Supergiant, Glenn Maxwell's Kings XI Punjab campaign came to an end in IPL 10

 The target of 74 runs could not be a challenge for Pune and the team achieved it with 48 balls to spare
 haalanki punjab ke captain maxwell ne team kii haar kaa dosha barish ke kaaran phislan se bhari pich ko diya he, lekin team ke cricket aapareshans ke diarector (menter) virendra sahvaag isse rajamand nahin dikhe
 After the match, he clearly stated that the foreign players of the team including Glene Maxwell did not meet the expectations in this knockout match and due to this the team had to face defeat
 team india ke dhamaakedaar ballebaaj sahvaag ne kaha, 'main niraash hum
 None of our foreign players played the responsibility of playing 12 to 15 overs
 in chaar main se kisi ek ko yah karnaa tha lekin kisi ne aisa nahin kiya
 'on Maxwell's argument about the wicket, Veeru said that he is complaining of some slowing of the wicket but when you have played so much international cricket then you should deal with such situation
 aise avasar kam hi aate hai jab aapako achche wicket milen
 Whichever wicket you get, you should play your overs on them but Maxwell, Shaun Marsh, Martin Guptill and Eoin Morgan disappointed
 sahvaag ne kaha ki gaptil kaa role score ko gati dene kaa tha or saaha unke sahyogi ke role main hote
 In such a situation, i will not blame Guptill's dismissal more, but other batsmen are definitely to blame
 yahaan tak ki marsh kii jimmedaari 10 se 12 over tak khilne kii thi lekin jis tareeke se ve out hue, vah durbhagyapurna tha
 Maxwell and Morgan are highly experienced players but they also disappoint
 sahvaag ne kaha ki ham jaanate hai ki jab maxwell dhamaakaa karte hai to akele dam par match jeet lete hai lekin ipel ke aath se nau maichon main aisa nahin dikhaa
 Team India batsman Sehwag said, 'I am disappointed
 hamaare kisi bhi videshi khilaadi ne 12 se 15 over tak khilne kii jimmedaari nahin nibhaai
 One of these four had to do it but none did it
 ' wicket ko lekar maxwell kii daleel par viru ne kaha ki ve wicket ke kuch dhime hone kii shikaayat kar rahe hai lekin jab aap itnaa adhik international cricket khel chuke hai to aapako aise halaat se nipatna aana chahie
 There are rare occasions when you get good wickets
 aapako jaise bhi wicket mili aapako in par apane over khilne chahie lekin maxwell, shaun marsh, martin gaptil or eon margan ne niraash kiya
 Sehwag said that Guptill's role was to speed up the score and Saha would have been in his colleague's role
 aise main main gaptil ke out hone ko zyada dosha nahin duungaa lekin anya ballebaajon kaa nishchit rup se dosha he
 Even Marsh had the responsibility of playing from 10 to 12 overs but the manner in which he was dismissed was unfortunate
 maxwell or morgan behad anbhavi player hai lekin inhone bhi niraash kiya
 Sehwag said that we know that when Maxwell explodes, he wins the match on his own, but in eight to nine matches of IPL he did not show it

 However, from Guna — a seat that was once represented by his father and grandmother — and which has been represented by some Scindia for 52 years in 67 years — Scindia is not taking any risk while contesting his fifth election
 party ne jab unhen pashchimi uttar pradesh kaa prabharee mahasachiv bana diya, unhone apane sabase ahm din is padosi rajya main chunaav kii taiyaari main lagaae
 But now he has returned to his constituency and is doing a tremendous tour to make up for his absence from the previous days
 chilchilaati garmi ke maddenjar unhone apni ranneeti badali or choti-choti sabhaayen karne kaa faisla liya
 In Mala Ganeshkheri village of Shivpuri district, he assured the farmers, "about 20 lakh farmers' debts have been written off and the rest of the loans will also be eradicated
" '' harek khate main 15 lakh rupye or do karod naukariyon ke daavon kaa makhul udaate hue unhone matadaataaon ko nyaay yojana, hive project, medical college or shivpuri kii jal supplai yojana ke bare main bataaya
 Family relations with the area were also repeatedly mentioned and the crowd seemed excited to see their 'maharaj'
 harek sabha main sindhiya ne ikattha logon se apane haath upar uthaakar samarthan kaa vaada karne ko kaha—thik usee tarah jaise bhaajapa ke shivaraj singh chouhan votaron se 'sankalp' lene ke liye kehete hai
 If there is anything missing in this election of Guna, it is the bjp's determination to give a strong fight — as it showed in 2014 by fielding Jaibhan Singh Pawaiya against Scindia

 yadav vidhansabha chunaav ke thik pehle congress chhodkar bhaajapa main aae the
 At that time, he stood from the Mungaoli assembly seat of Guna Lok Sabha constituency and lost
 yadav ke liye prachaar karne bhaajapa ko ek bhi bada netaa nahin aayaa he
 Even the absence of the famous opponents of Scindia like Prabhat Jha and Narottam Mishra is clearly visible
 bhaajapa ke rajya pravaktaa rahul kothaari in reporton ko darkinar kar dete hai ki party sindhiya ko kadi takkar nahin de rahi he or kehete hai, ''guna ke log narendra modi kii aguai main centre main majboot sarkaar ke liye vot denge
 The bsp's presence in the fold was never seen as a threat to the Congress — its candidate received 27,000 votes in the 2014 election, while Scindia's victory margin was 1
 20 lakh vot tha
 In this election, BSP candidate Lokendra Singh Rajput announced his support to Scindia, though his party chief Mayawati did not like his move
 is nirvachan kshetra main kuch ilaake hai, khaskar shivpuri, ashokanagar or guna kasbon ke ardh-shahari hisse, jahaan bhaajapa ke patibaddh voter hai
 a large number of BJP candidate's own community Yadavs are in this entire constituency
 yahi nahin, aath main se teen vidhansabha siten—guna, kolaras or shivpuri—bhaajapa ke paas hai
 "the crisis of farmers and lack of jobs are big issues," says Scindia
 bhaajapa ne rashtrawaad kaa ek hauva khadaa kiya he, kyonki jinhen main chunaav ke ahm mudde maanata hum, un par to pragati ke lihaaj se dikhaane ke liye uske paas kuch he hi nahin

 mahadevan ne is maukey par apana femes breathles gaanaa 'koi jo mila tha mujhe aisa lagata' gaakar sabko nishabd kar diya
 When asked Mahadevan how do you sing in one breath for so long? So in response, he said, 'it is not sung without breath, it is breathed
 This song is a concept if i do not breathe, i will die

 lekin phir baad maine kai vigyapanon ke liye gaaya or logon ko ye aid song bahut pasand aane lage or bas phir mujhe brake milte gaye
 When Mahadevan was asked by one of the shriyas in the "aaj Tak Manthan", whether the smart city concept was limited to only the rich or the poor section of society would be able to take advantage of it? In response to this, Mahadevan said that technology is not just for the rich people, but the poor will also be reached to it and the poor people too will definitely benefit from it

 Famous radio announcer Amin Sayani, who is making a comeback to the radio with his new show 'stars of Jawiyaan', said that he did not have time to meet Amitabh then, as the actor had not already taken time for a voice audition
 sayaani ne ek saakshaatkaar main kaha, ''yah 1960 ke dashak ke aakhir main kabhi hua tha, jab main ek hafte main 20 kaarykram karata tha
 
 
 Every day, most of my time was spent in the sound studio, as i was involved in every process of radio programming
 
 
 ek din amitabh bachchan naam kaa ek yuvak bina samay liye wais audishan dene aayaa
 
 
 '' sayaani ne kaha, ''mere paas us patale-duble vyakti ke liye bilkul samay nahin tha
 
 
 He waited and returned, even after that he came several times, but i could not meet him and kept saying through the receptionist that he should take the time first, then come
 
 
 '' The 81-year-old Sayani later came to know that it was Amitabh Bachchan, who used to come to his office to audition
 jab sayaani ne 'anand' film (1971) kaa ek troyal sho dekha to vah amitabh bachchan ke vyaktitv or awaz se prabhavit hue or tab unhen pataa nahin tha ki vah amitabh hi the, jo audishan ke liye aae the
 Rajesh Khanna worked with Amitabh in this film
 amin sayaani ne kaha, "amitabh ek award samaaroh main mukhya atithi ke rup main aae the or unhone apane sangharsh ke dinon ko yaad karte hue teen baar audishan ke liye radio stesan jane kii baat kahi or kaha ki unhen audishan main baithne bhi nahin diya gaya
 
 
 i was shocked to hear
 
 
 baad main jab maine unka saakshaatkaar kiya to hamane is par lambii charchaa kii or hanse
 
 
 " lekin itnaa sab hone ke baavjood padmashri se sammanit radio anounsar sayaani kaa maananaa he ki jo hua, vah achche ke liye hua
 He said, "although i still regret it today, but i think that what happened was good for both of us
" 
 
 main sadak par hota or unhen radio par itnaa kaam miltaa ki bhartiya cinema apane sabase bade sitare se vanchit rah jaataa
 
 
 " apane is nae kaarykram 'sitaron kii javaaniyaan' ke saath radio par vaapasi kar rahe sayaani is baar prasiddh abhinaytaon, abhinetriyon, khalnaayakon, hasya kalakaaron or charitra abhinaytaon se jude aise hi dilachasp kisse pesh karenge
 The show will air every Sunday evening on Radio City

 This is a very good thing
 lekin tum jaraa apane par bhi ise applai karnaa

 You have taken revenge for the defeat of Banaras by handing the Congress the cipher and BJP only three seats, but now you have to be very careful

 Or say that all the people around you know that you are sure of your tune
 ab itane nirankush mat ho janaa ki dilli garv ke bajaae gart main pahunch jaae
 Opposition is needed in a democracy - but you have also narrowed them down - or say they have settled

 The comments akhilesh ne kaha - 'rahul achche rajaneta hai

 Hey, we say that the Prime Minister and the National President of BJP are ematures by looking at the politics of UP
 uttar pradesh kaa vikaas dekh kar ke ve khud maior nahin hai
 Because the work that we have done here, Bharatiya Janata Party should state such a state where they have done such work
 gauratlab he ki ek angrezi akhbaar ne yah chhap diya tha ki shila dikshit ne rahul main 'macurity kii kami bataai he
 There was an attempt to make it a BJP side
 haalanki shila dikshit ne is akhbaar main chhapi khabar ko betuka or bebuniyaad bataaya or kaha ki unke bayaan ko tod marod kar or galat vyakhya ke saath chapa gaya he
 Akhilesh said - 'rahul is a good politician

 The BJP is surrounded with full responsibility, with full sense in the campaign
 are ham to kehete hai pradhanmantri or bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh imaior hai upi kii politics ko dekh kar ke
 Seeing the development of Uttar Pradesh, they themselves are not matured
 kyonki jo kaam hamane yahaan kiya he, bhartiya janata party aisa ek rajya bataae jahaan unhone aisa kaam kiya ho
 It is worth mentioning that an English newspaper gave the impression that Sheila Dixit has described Rahul as 'lack of maturity'
 bijepi kii taraf se ise tool dene kii koshish hui
 Sheila Dixit, however, described the news published in this newspaper as absurd and baseless and said that her statement has been tampered with and misprinted

 sambhaji kii kahani bhi aisi hi he, ek hectare main kheti thi, mausambi jal gai, kapaas flop ho gaya, karj par tractor liya tha, ab finance company vaale notice bhej rahe hai
 About 10 per cent of the farmers of Marathwada used to cultivate mausambi, at some time, it was considered beautiful to give a daughter to their house, which had more moss tree in their house

 ) sarkaar ke prabandhak kehete hai ye tathy he ki hamaare paas rajyasabha main bahumat nahin he
 They also believe that the opposition is united and is not allowing any opportunity to surround the government
 varanaa aise vidheyak jinase sidhe-sidhe rajyon ko phayda ho rahaa ho, rajyasabha main nahin roke jate
 However, the government is finding a way to end this impasse
 sarkaar ne vipaksh ke saath lambii baatcheet kii
 It was agreed that two bills - Coal Mines Auction and Mines and Mines (development and Regulation) will be sent to the Select Committee, but on the condition that their report is received within a week
 vahiin vipaksh motor whical tathaa beemaa bill ko paas karaane main sarkaar kii madad karegaa
 The same happened in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday
 do bill select cameti ko bhej die gaye, motor whical bill paarit ho gaya or beemaa bill guuruuvaar ko rajyasabha main aayega
 Congress is soft on the insurance bill
 uskaa kahana he ki ye usee kaa bill he
 The bill has been investigated in the Select Committee and the Standing Committee
 congress ko ye andaja he ki agar wo khul kar is bill par sarkaar kaa saath detii he to abhi tak badi mushkil se bana kar rakhi gai vipakshi ekta par aanch aa sakati he kyonki left partiyaan or trinmul congress beemaa bill ke sakht khilaaf hai
 But some senior Congress leaders say that opposition unity is based on issues
 beemaa bill kaa virodh karne vaali partiyaan ye daleel de rahi hai ki chunki ab ye ek nayaa bill he lihaaja ise select cameti ko bheja janaa chahie
 However, both the Congress and the government do not agree with this argument
 vahiin sarkaar chupchaap dhang se vipakshi dalon main send lagane kii koshish kar rahi he
 The managers of the government claim that if there was voting in the Rajya Sabha on the Mines and Mines (development and Regulation) bill, then the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party could have supported it because this bill is in favor of the states
 isi tarah trinmul congress bhi isamen kuch sanshodhano kii maang kar rahi thi
 On the other hand, parties like Biju Janata Dal and AIADMK are seen supporting the government on the basis of issues
 beemaa bill ko paas karaane ke liye sarkaar isi ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he
 But the government's real problem is with the land acquisition bill
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki ise rajyasabha main agle hafte laayaa jayega or usase pehle wo sabhi raajnneetik dalon se anaupchaarik taur par vichaar-vimarsh karnaa chaah rahi he
 It is certain that the Congress will not support it under any circumstances and it wants to send it to the Select Committee
 vipakshi dalon ko manaane ke liye sarkaar kuch nae sanshodhan laane se bhi inkaar nahin kar rahi he
 There is also a possibility that if the government is not successful in making a dent in the opposition parties, then it should not be brought to the Rajya Sabha in the first part of the budget session ending on March 20
 sarkaar kii ye ranneeti bhi he ki agar kol khadaan nilaamee or khan evam khadaan (vikaas evam niyaman), bhoomi adhigrahan bill 20 march se pehle paas na ho paaen to usee din satravsaan kar diya jaae
 By doing this, the government can issue ordinances on all these Bills again, as all these ordinances expire on April 5
 20 april se aath may tak hone vaale bajet satr ke duusare hisse ko ek nae satr ke rup main shuru kiya ja saktaa he
 The government says that this is just a technical matter which the opposition cannot resist because the government has the authority to do so
 sarkaar ke mutabik netaa vipaksh gulam nabi aaazaad khud sadan main ye kah chuke hai ki sarkaar aisa kar sakati he
 However, the government is working on these same strategies in the Rajya Sabha
 use bharosa he ki mahatvapurn bilon par vipaksh uskaa saath degaa
 On the other hand, a united opposition is not yet in the mood to give much concession to the government
 maharashtra ke mantri narayan rane ke bete nitesh rane ko jamaanat mil gai he
 He was arrested in a case of sabotage at the toll plaza in Goa
 haalanki kuch ghante baad unhen jamaanat par chhod diya gaya
 Actually Nitesh is the son of Maharashtra Revenue Minister Narayan Rane

 Police officials said that the people present in the convoy of cars led by Nitesh attacked the toll booth set up by the Goa government in Pernem village

 The new RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan is going to review monetary policy for the first time
 deshvasi mahangaai or mahange byaaj dar main raahat kii ummid kar rahe hai
 People's eyes are fixed on this side
 raghuram rajan nitigat samiksha aise samay main karne ja rahe hai, jabaki ek taraf to nitigat daron main katautee tathaa duusari ore mudrasphiti par kaabo paane ke kadamon kii jarurat jataai ja rahi he
 Inflation based on Wholesale Price Index rose to a 6-month high of 6 in August
 1 pratishat par pahunch gai
 The relief for Rajan is that the US Federal Reserve has not changed its cash incentive policy
 fedral rigerv ne beete din bazaaron ko yah kah kar chonka diya ki vah apana 85 arab dollar masik band kharid program jari rakhega or vruddhi main sudhaar ke or sabooton kaa intjaar karegaa
 The rupee fell sharply against the US dollar due to fears of a gradual dismantling of the Federal Reserve's stimulus program in the Indian economy, especially in the bond market
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki fedral rigerv ke is kadam se rajan ke paas girti aarthik vruddhi dar ko kaabo main laane ke kadam uthaane kii gunjaaish bachi he
 The central bank of the banker and industry in the mid-quarter Review of Monetary Policy for 2013-14 insisted on reduction in policy rates and easing of cash

 It is to be seen how much life Rajan is able to add to the economy

 Imagine what would happen if steam of hot water, hot ash, coals and strong pressure fell on your body from a height of 20 meters? On Wednesday afternoon at the NTPC plant in Rae Bareli, exactly what happened, the spirit trembled with the mere imagination
 pichley 7 saalon main hua bharat kaa shaayad yah sabase bada audyogic haadasa he
 So far 30 people have died and more than 100 people are injured
 is haadase main ek badi laaparvaahee ujagar hui he
 Tripped at 12 o'clock, while talking to the team of 'aajtak' inside the machineplant, an employee told that after twelve o'clock the boiler had gone to the tripper
 teen baje is dobaaraa chaalu kiya gaya or tabhi blast ho gaya
 In such a situation, when the boiler stopped at 12 o'clock, it was checked before starting again
 If the investigation was done, then why could not the experts guess the imminent danger? Is it the remorse that caused this destruction? 12 baje mashin kaa trip karne par hi sachet ho janaa chahie tha
 The machine itself made a hint of malfunction, but even then the machine ran again after three hours without removing the defect
 aise main saaf he ki kahin na kahin badi laaparvaahee barti gai he
 Darkness enveloped as soon as the explosion took place 
 
 plant main kaam karne vaale ek majdoor ne bataaya ki achaanak puraa boyler hilne laga phir gas pipe fat gai
 This laborer admitted in the hospital said that as soon as the explosion took place, there was darkness in front of my eyes
 uske baad kya hua, kuch hosh nahin he
 The blast in the boiler occurred in a 500 MW undertrial unit
 us vakt kareeb 200 log vahaan aasapaas kaam kar rahe the
 Ash pipe jamming is the major cause of the accident According to the employees working in the plant, one big reason for boiler burst is the ash pipe jamming
 raakh nikalnaa band gai thi, jisaki vajah se boyler main blast ho gaya
 It is evident that the jamming of ash pipes is a case of direct negligence, which caused havoc in this National Thermal Power Plant of Unchahar
 chand second main galane lageen chamadiyandhamakaa hote hi chaaron ore afratfari much gai
 Hundreds of laborers ran to save their lives, but within seconds the laborers' skin began to melt
 gale se aawaaj nikal nahin paa rahi thi
 Neither could anyone go in nor could anyone come out
 jhulase majdoor tadapate hue ghist ghist kar baahar nikal rahe the
 How dangerous the explosion at Unchahar's NTPC plant was, it is from this point that the echo of the blast was heard from about four kilometers away
 dhamaake kaa dhuaan kareeb 35 meter tak ooncha uthaa tha
 The dangerous result of great negligence was the explosion in the boiler, which was about 20 meters above the ground
 yani koyala, raakh, khulata pani or bhaap, chaaron mazdooron par gire
 The injured include the workers as well as 3 Assistant General Managers of NTPC plant
 philhal NTPC prabandhan ne jaanch ke aadesh de die hai, lekin itnaa to tay he ki ye haadasa khud se nahin balki kisi badi laaparvaahee kaa khatarnaak nateeja he
 a boiler does this
 a boiler is a tank in which water is rapidly circulated
 is dauraan pani ko atyadhik taapmaana par garm kiya jaataa he
 Which produces steam
 isi bhaap ne plant main kaam kar rahe mazaduron kii chamadi ko buree tarah jhulasa diya
 At the same time, that ash like embers also became deadly, which could not get out of the boiler

 dilli metro main divyangon ko landan kii tarj par ghar se tub (landan kii metro) tak laane kii suvidha dene ko lekar dilli hoicourt ne dmarsi ko notice jari kiya he
 The Delhi High Court asked the DMRC whether a facility like London Tube was provided to bring the Divas from home to tube and back to home? Why should not this facility be provided to the differently-abled in Delhi? In fact, the Delhi High Court wants to know what facilities DMRC can enhance to make the metros journey easier for the differently-abled in the national capital Delhi? At present, the court is hearing a public interest litigation seeking to make all the government departments and public transport in Delhi friendly to the differently abled

 It was only after this petition that the Delhi High Court stayed the government's notification to buy standard floor buses and said that the government should answer why the government is buying standard floor buses instead of low-floor buses? The Delhi High Court will next hear the matter on August 21

 Airtel and Vodafone Idea have now reduced the time of ringing of the bells on their outgoing network to just 25 seconds
 aamtaur par kol aane ke samay bajane vaali phone kii ghanti kii avadhi 40 se 45 second hoti he

 airtel or vodaphone idia dwaara uthaaye gayi is kadam kaa ek makasad kol jude rahane ke samay ke mutabik usapar lagane vaale interconect upyog shulk (aiusi) kii laagat ghataana bhi he
 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) unanimously asked the telecom companies involved in stiff competition among themselves to arrive at a solution before reaching any official decision on the interconnect charges
 interconect upyog shulk kisi ek network ko duusare network dwaara di jane vaali sevaaon par diya jaataa he
 In this, the network through which the call is made pays this fee to the network that reaches the call
 abhi isaki dar chah paisa prati minute he
 Airtel has sent a letter to TRAI on 28 September informing them of this decision
 vahiin sutron ne jaankaree di ki vodaphone idia ne bhi chuninda parikshetron main phone kii ghanti bajane kii avadhi ghataane kaa nirnay kiya he
 Airtel said that it has decided to limit the time the phone rings to 25 seconds

 Sources associated with TRAI told pti-language that the regulator is planning to hold an open discussion on the issue of 'time limit for ringing the call of the person to be called' on 14 October
 iske alaava is puure aiusi mudde par bhi baatcheet hogi
 a discussion paper has already been issued for this
 is par jald nirnay kiya jayega
 Airtel said in its letter, "although we felt that this may cause problems to customers, we have no other option left to take any instructions from TRAI and avoid loss of interconnect charges
" isliye hamane hamaare network par phone kii ghanti bajane kii avadhi ko ghataane kaa nirnay kiya he
 Airtel has repeatedly told TRAI about the impact of Jio's move
 company kaa kahana he ki phone kii ghanti bajane kii avadhi kam karne se missd kol kii sankhya badhegi
 This will increase the number of calls to a person and also call back after seeing a missed call
 isse graahakon ke anubhav ke saath-saath network kii gunvattta par bura prabhaav padegaa
