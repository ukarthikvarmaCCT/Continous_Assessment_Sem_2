 com / 6ydqnf9er8 — Mamta Yash Patnaik (@mamtaypatnaik) September 18, 2016 Now let's see if these Love Birds are able to unite in the upcoming episodes or whether a new twist is in the line! agar aap apni diet main calories ke percent ko control karke rakhte hai or iske liye fiks or healdi diet lete hai to aapke liye ek acchhee khabar he
 Such people remain fit as well as their sex life is also better than those who cannot control diet
 ek adhyayan ke anusaar, kam or healdi khaane vaale na keval feet rahete hai balki unka mood bhi acha rahata he
 Taking a good diet also helps in tension control
 is tarah mood acha rahane or tension nahin hone se sex lifebhi behatar banati he
 Researchers at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana gave the results after studying 218 healthy teenagers
 is adhyayan ke liye logon ko do group main baanta gaya
 One group was asked to consume 25% fewer calories and the other group was asked to take a normal diet
 shodhakarta corbi martin kaa kahana he ki jis group ne kam calories lee thi, unki sex life tulanaatmak rup se zyada behatar ho gai
 Not only this, he also got good sleep and lost weight
 research main kaha gaya he ki agar mote log apni diet ko control kar len to unki neend or sex life behatar ho sakati he
 This study has been published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine
 research main kaha gaya he ki agar healdi log do saal tak kam calories vaala khaanaa khaaen to unke liye iskaa ulta rigelt hoga
 This rule is only effective for obese people
 new southwells skool of psychology researchrs ke anusaar, aap kiske saath baithkar khaanaa khate hai, ye baat bhi aapaki diet ko prabhavit karti he
 In such a situation, if you want to reduce the weight, then eat food with people who eat less
 isse vajan jaldi kam hoga or sex life smood banegi
 This effect has been observed more in women than men
 soshal influence jarnal main publish is research ke peeche kaaran diya gaya he ki mahilaon ko is baat kii zyada parvaah hoti he ki khaane ke dauraan duusare unke bare main kya soch rahe hai
 So she eats less and controls calories
 punjab sarkaar kii cabinet kii meeting main mahilaon ke aarakshan ko lekar ek bada faisla liya gaya he
 According to sources, this cabinet meeting has approved the decision to give 50% reservation to women in all municipal, civic and panchayat elections to be held in Punjab
 iske tamaam sarkari mahakamon main naukari se lekar chunaav tak mahilaon ko 33% aarakshan aarakshan diya jayega
 That is, women will get reservation everywhere except just the assembly seats
 gauratlab he ki punjab ke mukhyamantri amarinder singh kii adhyakshata main cabinet kii pehali baithak main hi sabhi sarkari naukariyon main mahilaon ko 33 fisadi aarakshan dene kii baat kahi gai thi
 The Punjab Congress had contested during the election campaign that the representation of women in Panchayati Raj Institutions and Local Body Institutions would be increased from 33 per cent to 50 per cent
 bihar desh kaa pehla aisa rajya he jisane panchayat chunaavon main 50 fisadi aarakshan mahilaon ke liye kiya tha iske baad kai anya rajyon ne bhi bihar se sikh lee
 There is a 33 percent reservation for women in Uttar Pradesh's panchayat elections, while 44 percent more women are village-heads than this reservation
 2006 main bihar ke is faisle ke baad us saal 55 fisadi mahilaayengram pradhan chun karain thi
 Explain that the constitution of the country ensures 33 percent participation of women in the Panchayati Raj system
 desh ke kul nirvaachit sarpanchon main se abhi 44 fisadi to mahilaayein hi hai
 In this case, Chief Minister Kamal Nath issued a statement on Saturday, saying, 'I just came to know that when a video of a professor in a government school in Jabalpur in the state saying my name in a meeting came out in a district, there was a district The administration has suspended him under the Civil Services Conduct Rules on receiving the complaint
 loktantr main abhivyakti kii swatantraaa sabhi ko he, meraa aisa maananaa he

 'mukhyamantri ne kaha ki yah bhi sahi he ki shaskeey seva main padasth rahete hue unka yah aacharan niyamon kaa ulanghan ho saktaa he, isliye un par nilamban kii karrwaiki gai he
 But i think that he must have done austerity, hard work for so many years to come to this post
 puraa parivaar un par ashrith hoga
 Suspension proceedings may cause them to go through difficulties
 kamalnath ne kaha, ‘ek mukhyamantri par aapattijanak tippanee se in par nilamban kii kaarywahi kii jaae, yah niyamon ke hisaab se sahi ho saktaa he lekin main vyaktigat rup se inhen maaf karnaa chahta hoon

 ummid karata hoon ki ve bhavishya main apane kartavyon par dhyaan denge
 The Chief Minister said that he has instructed the district administration that their suspension should be expedited
 in par koi kaarywahi naa kii jaye
 They should decide for themselves what they have said for the Chief Minister of the elected government of the people, is this correct? Kamal Nath said, 'the teacher has also said that Seva Bharati has been harassed in the last 14 years
 apano ne hamen pareshaan kiya
 i just assure them that we should not think of them
 ham badale kii bhaavana se koi bhi kaary nahin karenge or naa hi apano kii tarah aapako pratadit karenge
 Meanwhile, the district administration Jabalpur has withdrawn the order to suspend the teacher on the instructions of the Chief Minister
 colector bharadwaj ne kaha ki shikshak dwaara is maamle main kaaran bataao notice ke jawaab main maaphi maange jane or iske saath hi mukhyamantri dwaara shikshak ko maaf karne ke nirdesh diye gayi hai
 Therefore, the suspension of the teacher has been abolished

 kushi manaaiye ki karnataka main chunaav hai varna petrol kaa daam 90 rupee tak chalaa gaya hota
 Prices of petrol and diesel have not been increasing for the last 13 days, while the price of crude oil in international markets is increasing
 yah jaadu kaise ho rahaa he? jabaki pichley june main sarkaar ne kaha ki ab se tel companiyaan rose ke bhav ke hisaab se daam tay karengi
 Very much appreciated
 andar andar yah kaha gaya ki rose kuch na kuch badhata rahegaa to janata ko pataa nahin chalegaa
 You will read the first story of Shine Jacob of Business Standard
 industry ke sutron ke hawaale se likhaa he ki gujarat chunaavon main bhi daam badhaane nahin diya gaya, karnataka chunaavon ke kaaran bhi roak diya gaya he
 That is, the freedom to fix the price every day is nonsense
 daam abhi bhi sarkaar ke hisaab se ghat bad rahe hai
 Imagine if there was no election during this time, then how far the price of petrol would have reached
 shin jaikab ne tel companiyon ke sutron ke hawaale se likhaa he ki daam nahin badhaane ke kaaran unke munaafe kaa margin kam hota ja rahaa he
 His average margin on April 1 was Rs 3 per liter, which has come down to less than Rs 2 on May 1
 margin main 45 pratishat kii kami ai he
 Oil companies are under great pressure
 sarkaar ne 23 april se daamon ko badhanaa roak diya he

 Millions of MNREGA workers have not been paid even after six months of work
 media kis had tak janvirohi ho gaya he aap dekhie
 If a worker does not get 2000, some 500
 in paison ke na hone se un par kya biit rahi hogi
 How would their home run
 kaayade se is baat ke liye desh main hangaamaa much janaa chahie
 The mainstream media for which you pay has almost stopped this kind of work
 indiaspend naam kii nai website he, isane research kar bataaya he ki sarkaar ke hi aankade kehete hai ki 1 april 2018 tak lakhon manaregaa mazaduron ko paise nahin mili hai
 Government's MNREGA budget 14 for 2018-19
 5 pratishat badhaayaa tha tab phir paise kyon nahin die ja rahe hai? manaregaa ke liye sarkaar kaa bajet 55000 karod he
 57 percent of the wages have not been paid
 bank karmchaaree maayoos hai
 After five years, it was the turn of salary to increase, but there is no trouble
 mumbai main bainkon ke prabandhan ke samooh or karmchaaree union ke bich baatcheet hui
 In this negotiation, it was proposed to increase salary by only 2 percent, which hurt employees
 is mahangaai main 2 pratishat to kuch nahin
 It is telling that the banks have now gone from within
 bank karmchaariyon kii selary vaaki bahut kam he
 So little that they leave the metropolis in that salary, they cannot live in any town
 abhi bhi kai bankeron ko lagata he ki notebandi ke samay unhone koi rashtriya yogadan diya tha jiskaa inaam milanaa chahie tha
 Nowadays, first of all, they have to understand that demonetisation was a serious fraud
 ab sarkaar bhi iske phaayde kii baat nahin karti he
 The Prime Minister has also avoided it
 usee notebandi ke kaaran bhi bainkon kii haalat kharaab hui he
 Nevertheless, the work given to the bankers was carried out day and night
 apni jeb se harjaana bharaa
 You cannot achieve anything without moral strength and solidarity
 karmchaariyon ko un bankeron ko khud expos karnaa chahie jinhone galat tareeke se paise kamaaye hai
 Because of these thieves, the public is also not sympathetic to common bankers
 inaki vajah se baaki log naukari main rahete hue bhukhmaree ke kagaar par hai
 Bankers themselves will have to explain why the condition of banks is such
 karmchaaree itane kam hai ki ve graahakon kii seva nahin kar paa rahe hai
 They are under pressure to sell Yen Can to government schemes except the customer
 tippaniyan Media will not support in this battle of bankers
 sabhi bankeron ko aaj hi apane ghar se cabel tivi kaa conection katwa dena chahie or akhbaar band kar dena chahie
 When his life is not changing, what will he do after reading the newspaper? jab media unka saath nahin detaa to ve akhbaar or cabel tivi par 400 se 600 rupee kyon karch kar rahe hai? agar ve is level ke murkh hai, to unka bhagwaan hi maalik he
 Bankers should be ashamed that they buy newspapers
 bees lakh ke kareeb banker hai
 Including their families, the number is one crore
 agar ek karod kii sankhya vaale samooh kii ye aukaat he, uski naagarikta kaa mol shunya ho gaya he to use yah sab karnaa chahie
 Until you achieve your citizenship and the right to be public, no one will pay attention to your demands

 63 prati litre petrol or 65
 Rs 93 per liter of diesel
 mumbai main to 82 rupaya prati litre pahunch gaya he
 Millions of MNREGA workers have not been paid even after six months of work
 media kis had tak janvirohi ho gaya he aap dekhie
 If a worker does not get 2000, some 500
 in paison ke na hone se un par kya biit rahi hogi
 How would their home run
 kaayade se is baat ke liye desh main hangaamaa much janaa chahie
 The mainstream media for which you pay has almost stopped this kind of work
 indiaspend naam kii nai website he, isane research kar bataaya he ki sarkaar ke hi aankade kehete hai ki 1 april 2018 tak lakhon manaregaa mazaduron ko paise nahin mili hai
 Government's MNREGA budget 14 for 2018-19
 5 pratishat badhaayaa tha tab phir paise kyon nahin die ja rahe hai? manaregaa ke liye sarkaar kaa bajet 55000 karod he
 57 percent of the wages have not been paid
 bank karmchaaree maayoos hai
 After five years, it was the turn of salary to increase, but there is no trouble
 mumbai main bainkon ke prabandhan ke samooh or karmchaaree union ke bich baatcheet hui
 In this negotiation, it was proposed to increase salary by only 2 percent, which hurt employees
 is mahangaai main 2 pratishat to kuch nahin
 It is telling that the banks have now gone from within
 bank karmchaariyon kii selary vaaki bahut kam he
 So little that they leave the metropolis in that salary, they cannot live in any town
 abhi bhi kai bankeron ko lagata he ki notebandi ke samay unhone koi rashtriya yogadan diya tha jiskaa inaam milanaa chahie tha
 Nowadays, first of all, they have to understand that demonetisation was a serious fraud
 ab sarkaar bhi iske phaayde kii baat nahin karti he
 The Prime Minister has also avoided it
 usee notebandi ke kaaran bhi bainkon kii haalat kharaab hui he
 Nevertheless, the work given to the bankers was carried out day and night
 apni jeb se harjaana bharaa
 You cannot achieve anything without moral strength and solidarity
 karmchaariyon ko un bankeron ko khud expos karnaa chahie jinhone galat tareeke se paise kamaaye hai
 Because of these thieves, the public is also not sympathetic to common bankers
 inaki vajah se baaki log naukari main rahete hue bhukhmaree ke kagaar par hai
 Bankers themselves will have to explain why the condition of banks is such
 karmchaaree itane kam hai ki ve graahakon kii seva nahin kar paa rahe hai
 They are under pressure to sell Yen Can to government schemes except the customer
 tippaniyan Media will not support in this battle of bankers
 sabhi bankeron ko aaj hi apane ghar se cabel tivi kaa conection katwa dena chahie or akhbaar band kar dena chahie
 When his life is not changing, what will he do after reading the newspaper? jab media unka saath nahin detaa to ve akhbaar or cabel tivi par 400 se 600 rupee kyon karch kar rahe hai? agar ve is level ke murkh hai, to unka bhagwaan hi maalik he
 Bankers should be ashamed that they buy newspapers
 bees lakh ke kareeb banker hai
 Including their families, the number is one crore
 agar ek karod kii sankhya vaale samooh kii ye aukaat he, uski naagarikta kaa mol shunya ho gaya he to use yah sab karnaa chahie
 Until you achieve your citizenship and the right to be public, no one will pay attention to your demands

 manaregaa ke lakhon mazaduron ko kaam karne ke baad bhi chah chah maheene se vetan nahin mila he
 See to what extent the media has become anti-people
 kisi mazdoor ko 2000 nahin mila to kisi ko 500
 With this money, what would have been going on them
 unka ghar kaise chalata hoga
 Ideally, there should be an uproar in the country for this
 jis mukhyadhara kii media ke liye aap paise dete hai, usne is tarah kaa kaam lagbhag band kar diya he
 There is a new website named indiaspend, it has done research and has told that the figures of the government itself say that till 1 April 2018, lakhs of MNREGA workers have not received money
 2018-19 ke liye sarkaar ne manaregaa kaa bajet 14
 If we had increased it by 5 percent, then why are the money not being given again? The budget of the government for MNREGA is 55000 crores
 57 pratishat mazaduri kaa bhugtan nahin hua he
 Bank employees are desperate
 paanch saal baad selary badhane kii baari thi magar kuch ata-paat nahin he
 Talks were held between a group of banks' management and an employee union in Mumbai
 is baatcheet main sirf 2 pratishat selary badhaane kaa prastaav diya gaya jisase karmchaaree aahat ho gaye
 2 percent is nothing in this inflation
 yah bataa rahaa he ki bank ab bheetar se charmara gaye hai
 The salary of bank employees is very low
 itani kam ki ve us selary main mahanagar to chhodie kisi kasbe main nahin rah sakate hai
 Many bankers still feel that they had made a national contribution during the time of demonetisation, which should have been rewarded
 aaj na kal unhen sabase pehle yahi samajhnaa hoga ki notebandi kabhi na sabit hone vaala ek gambhir frod tha
 Now the government also does not talk about its benefits
 pradhanmantri bhi isse kinaaraa kar chuke hai
 The same demonetisation has also worsened the condition of banks
 phir bhi bankeron ko jo kaam diya gaya use unhone din raat lagaakar nibhaayaa
 Damages filled with your pocket

 Employees should expose themselves to the bankers who have made wrong money
 in choron kii vajah se janata bhi aam bankeron ke prati sahanubhuti nahin rakhti he
 Because of this, the rest of the people are on the verge of hunger while in jobs
 bankeron ko hi khud bataanaa padegaa ki bainkon kii haalat aisi kyon hai
 Employees are so few that they are unable to serve customers
 un par graahak ko chhod sarkari yojanaon ko yen ken prakaren bikwane kaa dabaav he
 The comments bankeron kii is ladaai main media saath nahin degaa
 All bankers should cut off the cable TV connection from their home today and close the newspaper
 jab unka hi jivan nahin badal rahaa he to akhbaar pard kar kya karenge
 Why are they spending 400 to 600 rupees on newspaper and cable TV when the media does not support them? If they are fools of this level, then their God is the master
 bankeron ko shame aani chahie ki ve akhbaar kharidte hai
 There are close to two million bankers
 unke pariwaron ko mila len to ek karod kii sankhya he
 If this number of a group of one crore is its value, its citizenship value has been reduced to zero then he should do all this
 jab tak aap apni naagarikta or janata hone ke adhikaar ko hasil nahin karenge tab tak aapaki maangon par koi dhyaan nahin degaa

 In Chhattisgarh, senior BJP leader and MP Ramesh Bais has said that Chhattisgarh is not a tribal majority but an OBC (other Backward Class) majority state

 It is worth noting that in Chhattisgarh, the population of tribals is 32 percent, while the OBC population is 50 percent
 bas ne pradesh kurmi samaaj ke pradesh stareey sammelan main kaha, 'hamaare saamne aawaaj uthaane vaala koi nahin he
 Now the opportunity to speak has come
 hamen ek hokar bolnaa hoga
 This statement of Bais came at a time when the organization between the OBC and tribal contenders for the state president in BJP is in a state of chaos
 adivasee varg se saansad vikram usendi or purv mantri ramavichaar netaam kaa naam chal rahaa he, jabaki obisi se purv vidhansabha adhyaksh dharmlaal kowshik prabal daavedaar hai
 Kaushik's name is being mentioned at number one, but there is also an influential section lobbying the tribal president citing the plurality of the tribal class
 is kaaran bas ke bayaan kaa sidhaa asar pradesh adhyaksh kii niyukti par pad saktaa he
 Bais is one of the core members of the core BJP group of the state
 yahi vajah he ki unke is bayaan ke raajnneetik myne bhi nikaale ja rahe hai
 The important thing is that on the platform from which Bais said this, former Assembly Speaker Kaushik was also present
 bas rajdhani ke maharashtra mandal sabhagrih main sarv kurmi samaaj ke pradesh stareey sammelan kii adhyakshata kar rahe the
 He said that such an atmosphere is being created in the state that the Kurmi society is not one

 This message will go all over the state
 bas ne kaha, 'kurmi samaaj se chhattisgarh main ek mantri ajay chandrakar hai or ek saansad main hum

 lekin kuch bahari or kuch samaaj ke hi log pair khinchne main lage rahete hai

 After the 1962 war, he has been using his relations with Pakistan to pressure India
 3
 Why do we need a rapport with Pakistan? Because it is easier to destroy the plans of stronger China
 iske alaava saamaanya pakistan se hamen apane ghar main shanti kii guarantee milti he
 And most importantly, thanks to this relationship, we get direct contact with Afghanistan and Iran
 4
 What is America's helplessness in Pakistan? If a few dollars and a little support helps America to complete its mission in Afghanistan, then what is the harm in this? afghanistan kii seemaa samudr se nahin lagati, aise main pakistan ke bandargahon se america zyada se zyada saplaay ko afghanistan main maujuud apni sena tak pahunchaa saktaa he
 Its bases in Afghanistan help Iran on one side and pressure on China on the other
 5
 Role of india-russia relationship? Despite being peacetime, the largest business in the world is arms
 or is industry ke do sabase bade khilaadi hai america or rus
 India remained close to Russia during the Cold War
 or hamaare desh ko hathiyaaron kii sabase badi saplaay bhi rus se hi hoti thi
 But this balance has changed in recent times
 2013 main rus ko peeche chhodte hue america ne bharat ko sabase zyada hathiyaar beche
 1
 19 billian dollar kaa kaarobaar hua
 The root is tension with Pakistan and China
 or 5 vajah pakistan ke bheetar:- pakistan kii videsh niti kaa kor kashmir par hi tikaa hua he
 Its entire machinery is engaged in making Kashmir case international
 raajnneetik dalon main iske liye hode machi rahati he ki koun is maamle ko behatar dhang se bhunaa saktaa he
 In such a situation, every party wants America's friendship
 - pakistan ke kuch sanghathan or sena ke purv afasar khule taur par aatanki sanghathanon kii madad karte rahe hai
 Both money and training
 pakistan inhen non-state actor kahata rahaa he, lekin karrwai nahin kar paata
 Because they are powerful, organized and dangerous
 aise main antarrashtriya str par pakistan kii chhavi ko saaf rakhane main use america kaa munh dekhnaa padataa he
 - Pakistan's society is divided into three parts, like the upper, middle and lower classes of any other country
 lekin pakistan main ucch varg main aate hai bhrasht netaa, sena ke afasar or bade jagirdaar
 Their rule from Punjab to Karachi is similar to that of the kings of old
 sarvice class vaala madhyam varg dhire-dhire ubhar rahaa he, lekin vah bharat ke madhyam varg kii tarah taqatvar nahin he
 And the third and last lower class is in a very bad condition here
 punjab or sindh main gulaamon kii tarah
 While worse than animals in the western areas
 - pakistani sena kii desh kii raajnneeti main bhoomika bhi use america ke kareeb le jaati he
 She wants to keep the pressure on power and wants to lead from America to convince herself well with political force
 - or aakhir main satta kaa bhrashtachar
 On this, only the report of the US Congress says that the leader and army of Pakistan have been seeking help from America and then with that dollar they increased their bank balance or used it against India

 team india ne isisi cricket world cap 2019 main shanivaar ko romaanchak match main afghanistan ko 11 ranon se haraa diya
 Afghanistan had a brilliant performance with the ball, stopping India for 224 runs at the loss of eight wickets in 50 overs, but their batsmen could not reach the target and 49
 5 overon main 213 ranon par dher ho gaye
 India had to work very hard to win against Afghanistan
 lekin ant main shami kii hetric or bumraah kii kasi gendbaaji se team india ne baaji maar lee
 There were three such turning points in this match that made Team India's victory possible, otherwise the picture could have been different
 1
 Mohammed Shami's hat-trick: Shami got his first chance after not playing four matches in the current World Cup
 shami ko bhubaneshwar ke chotil hone ke baad is match main team india kii plaing ilevan main shaamil kiya gaya or unhone aate hi unhone kamaal kar diya
 Mohammed Shami hit a hat-trick in this match to give India a win by 11 runs against Afghanistan
 225 ranon kaa peechha karne utari afghanistan ko aakhri over main 16 ranon kii jarurat thi
 Nabi hit his half-century off the first ball and brought a wrinkle to India's forehead, but Shami took the next ball out empty and on the third ball of the over, Nabi was caught by Hardik Pandya on Log On to make the match in India's favor
 gave
 agali do gendon par shami ne aftab alam or mujeeb ur rahamaan ke wicket le afghanistan ko 49
 Stacking 213 runs in 5 overs gave India a fourth victory in this World Cup
 shami ne shandaar vaapasi kar na sirf apana naam itihaas main darj karaayaa balki bharat ko ulatpher kaa shikaar hone se bachaa liya
 2
 bumraah ke sateek yorker:is match main jo team india ke liye sabase bada terning point sabit hua vah star gendbaaj jasprit bumraah kii gendbaaji thi
 Bumrah kept the Afghanistan batsmen from making big shots by putting accurate and dangerous yorkers on crucial occasions
 yahi donon tiimon ke bich main antar rahaa
 Afghanistan needed 21 runs to win in the last two overs
 yahaan bumraah ne 49waan over phenkaa or sirf paanch ran die
 This economical over from Bumrah challenged Afghanistan to score 16 runs in the last over
 phir shami ke aakhri over kii pehali gend par chaukaa padane se afghanistan ko or bal mil gaya tha lekin shami ne shandaar vaapasi kar afghanistan ko 212 ran par dher kar diya
 Bumrah took 2 wickets in this match
 lekin, unki dhardaar gendbaaji se hi bharat ko jeet mili
 3
 kohli-jadhav kaa ardhashatak:match main viraat kohli or kedaar jadhav ne ardhashatak lagaakar bharat kaa score 224 ranon tak pahunchaaya

 kya gaanvon main yun mitti dhonaa asar nahin kar rahaa? kya bacchon se yun khelnaa unhen logon se nahin jod rahaa? kya daliton ke bich khaanaa beasar ho rahaa he? kya rahul ke bhaashan aam logon ko nahin lubhaate? kya virodhiyon par joardaar hamalaa karanevaale rahul kanfujd hai?ye tamaam sawaal aaj isliye uth rahe hai kyonki ek angreji patrika da iconomist ne rahul gandhi ke bare main chhaapi hai kuch behad alag si baaten
 Such things are questioning the political understanding of Rahul Gandhi
 baaten aisi jo rahul gandhi kii kaabiliyat ko hi katghare main khadaa kar rahi hai
 The Economist has cited in his article a book by Aarti Ramachandran, an Indian writer
 videshi patrika daawa karti he ki wo jo likh rahi he, uskaa aadhaar aarti ramchandran kii nai kitaab 'decoding rahul gandhi' hi he
 Based on Aarti's book, The Economist wrote, "according to the book, it seems clear that the brand Rahul is completely confused
 ek vyakti jiske paas har tarah kii suvidhaayen hai, jo sirf apane parivaar kii vajah se khadaa he, wo apni baat ko prabhaavshaalee banane ke liye jujhataa dikhataa he
 'the Economist's arrows are more for Rahul Gandhi
 patrika ko rahul kii har ranneeti main kamajori dikhti he
 It has been insisted in the magazine that the problem is this, 'rahul Gandhi has not shown any great sense as a politician till now
 naa unamem jimmedaariyon kii bhukh dikhti he
 They are shy wo patrakaron se baat karnaa nahin chaahate hai
 Neither do they raise their voice in Parliament
 kisi ko ye samaj main nahin aa rahaa he ki wo kis kaabil hai
 It is also suspected that Rahul Gandhi himself is able to understand himself
 jaahir he, rahul par kisi patrika kaa ye nishaanaa pehali baar he
 But first such attacks on Prime Minister and now Rahul Gandhi, two big leaders of Congress, are of concern for the Congress

 brallep hone par dil tuutata he or aksar log udhaas dikhte hai
 But 'koi Laut Ke Aaya Hai' is totally opposite with Fame actress Sreejita Dey

 But he is not disappointed by this, but he is feeling freedom
 apane brallep ke bare main shrijita de ne kaha he ki unka eks boyfriend unako apane kaabo main rakhata tha
 He was particularly troubled by his dress
 tabhi alag hokar unako aazaadee kaa ehsaas ho rahaa he
 Actress Sreejita Dey, who has also appeared in a popular show like Detoutran, has given the real reasons behind her break-up recently
 unhone kaha- jise main date kar rahi thi, use mere kapadon ke saath meri pasand ke kaam se bhi dikkat thi
 In an interview given to Lovetimes of India, Sreejita said that she did not know that she would have to change herself to win the love of an IT engineer
 chote parde par ho rahi he is mjedaar sho kii vaapasi, vidya baalan bhi rahi hai hissasrijita ne yah bhi mahasoos kiya ki jab wo usase pyaar karne lageen to uski pasand ke hisaab se khud ko dhaalane kii koshish bhi kii
 She also changed the way she wears but she could not compromise on work
 tabhi shrijita kaa kahana he ki vah unako control karne kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 He used to get their updates all the time and he used to object to her going to parties
 jabaki shrijita apane hisaab se jeene waalon main se hai
 In the beginning, he felt that everything would be alright and he would get a set partner
 lekin aisa ho nahin sakaa
 Kapil Sharma spoke of Nina Gupta's 'disrespectful' women empowerment, just a pretense that we talk about women empowerment, but always comes to compromise with the girl when it comes to looking for a 'good person' Is expected shrijita ne ye bhi kaha ki us rishte ke dauraan main khud se lard rahi thi or baar-baar apneaap se sawaal karti thi ki kya main sahi rishte main hum
 But then, troubled by the daily quarrels, i felt that it is better to separate our paths

 The CA wanted the tradition of playing the day-night format test match in Adelaide to continue, so it proposed to play the Test match in the day-night format starting December 6 during the series with India

 It is difficult to accept that this decision has any reason other than to increase the chances of winning the first Test series against Australia, considered a weak opponent

 You cannot leave the matter to the political community
 soshal media main jhaank kar dekhiye
 If you are not worried about the language of hate then it is more frightening
 vahaan ek kism kii sanak savaar jo uksaa rahi he ki shaam kii tivi kii ye bahesbaziyaan usee tarah se bhadaken jaise pehle ke maamle main bhadakin
 Allegedly TV is silent, so the craze is justified
 jabaki akhbaar-tivi sab report kar rahe hai
 In this excuse, he is spreading hatred from here to there in many ways
 nayaa maamla is ladki ko lekar he jo aaj adaalat main pesh hui or bayaan diya
 The 20-year-old girl is alleged to have been abducted and gangraped by a cleric and converted
 ladki kaa gaanv meerut shahar se pandrah kimi dur he, jahaan uskaa sampark pachaas saal ke maulavee sanoullah se hota he
 There are connections between the maulvi and the girl's family
 maulavee ke kaaran hi use kisi madrase main pandrah sau maheene par padhaane kii naukari mili
 The girl's father is landless and does not earn
 bie final kii padhai kar rahi is ladki ke upar paanch logon kii jimmedaari bhi he
 There are some links in the girl's claims, which are not linking, which are still being investigated
 23 july ko pehali baar ladki sanoullah ke saath jaati he or chaar dinon baad 27 july ko laut aati he
 Then she does not allege gang rape nor complains in the police station
 parivaar waalon kaa daawa he ki 23 july ko hi shikaayat karaane gaye the, magar police ne darj nahin kii
 When our colleague asked the family for a copy of the complaint dated July 23, we got the reply that we do not have the copy
 parivaaravaalon ne 27 taarikh ko ladki ke lautne ke baad police ko jaankaree nahin di, tab bhi jab uske pet main pattee bandhi thi
 The father claims that the girl stayed in Sanaullah's house from 27 to 29
 magar police kaa kahana he ki vah apane ghar waalon ke saath hi thi
 On July 29, the girl disappears once again
 29 july ko police pita kii shikaayat darj kar lete hai
 According to the father, he was ready to be sent to Dubai
 maa ne kaha he ki maulavee ganda tabeez karata he, usne beti ko vasheebhoot kar liya tha
 That is, he made such a magic that the girl went under his influence
 yah vah kadi he jiskaa judana baaki he
 According to the family, on August 3, the girl managed to escape from the madrasa in Muzaffarnagar and the girl told a bike-riding youth near the madrasa that the operation was done, she was in trouble and that she should put her in a bus going to Meerut
 yuvak ne use bas main bitha diya
 The bus calls the family members with the phone of a passenger
 parivaaravaalon ke anusaar ladki ko lekar sidhaa thane pahunche
 The police wrote and tore the complaint several times in the police station
 jab exiaar nahin kar rahaa he, tab in logon ne saansad se sampark kiya
 mps and BJP leaders reached the police station and local people also came
 hangaamaa kiya jiske baad police ne pita kii shikaayat par exiaar darj kii
 On the same day the village head Nawab Khan arrested Sanaullah's wife and girl friend
 sanoullah faraar he
 In the first medical test, the results of rape and the cause of the operation have not been concrete
 isiilie police dobaaraa medical jaanch karvaa rahi he
 There is also an allegation that a madrasa in Hapur was converted
 ladki ke paas ek halafanama baraamad hua he, jisamen yah likhaa hua he ki marzi se dharm badal rahi hum
 The police is also investigating this aspect
 ladki kaa aarope tha ki mujffarnagar ke kisi madrase main kai hindu ladkiyaan band hai, jinhen dubai bhejne kii taiyaari ho rahi he
 The police raided itself on Sunday night
 police ke mutabik chaar ladkiyaan milin, jo muslim thi or chaaron ne kaha ki apni marji se yahaan rah rahi hai

 In response to a question asked about this at the event in Bhopal, former BJP leader Yashwant Sinha told reporters, 'it is absolutely true that the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had decided after the communal riots in Gujarat that Narendra Modi, the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, should resign
 ' unhone kaha, ‘goa main (bhaajapa kii) rashtriya kaarysmiti kii baithak hui thi, jisamen atal ji man bana kar gaye the ki modiji istipha nahin denge to unako wo barkhaast karenge
 Yashwant Sinha told, 'there was a consultation in the party

 Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh said on Friday that the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) is exaggerating the coal block allocation issue and making it sensational
 digvijay singh ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, '2004 ke baad se sieji tathyon kii pushti kiye bagaiyr or kaalpanik nuksaan prastut karte hue jis tarah kii rapaten pesh kar rahe hai, usase dekhne main ek aisa vaataavaran taiyaar ho rahaa he jaise ki karodon rupee kaa nuksaan hua ho
 'the CAG had said in its report earlier this month that due to lack of transparency in allocation of coal blocks to private companies 1 to the government exchequer
 86 lakh karod rupee kaa nuksaan hua he
 Digvijay said, 'CAG Tea in the late 1980s

 Chaturvedi later joined the BJP
 'digvijay ne kaha ki unhone kisi sanvaidhanik sanstha par kabhi hamalaa nahin kiya
 But he said that he feared that the CAG was overstating the figures
 singh ne kaha, 'maine apane jivan main kisi sanvaidhanik sanstha par kabhi hamalaa nahin kiya
 But if you look at the previous records of CAG before 2004, you will find that no record was ever made sensational
 aisa pehali baar ho rahaa he jab sieji ke log, na ki sieji, press tak main ja rahe hai
 Digvijay said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was creating a ruckus in Parliament over the coal block allocation and running away from the debate as it knew it did not have the numbers
 singh ne kaha, 'yadi vipaksh sansad ko nahin chalane de rahaa he, to iskaa arth yah hota he ki uske paas sankhya bal nahin he or main chakit hum ki iske baavjood ve pradhanmantri kaa istipha maang rahe hai

 Concerns about increase in investment cost of petroleum products In the letter written by the Finance Minister, the concern about increasing investment cost of petroleum products in the manufacturing sector of the country has been given in view of the Goods and Services Tax regime
 jiesti vyavastha se pehle petroleum utpaadon or ant main utpaadit maal donon par waite lagata tha
 Input tax credit of petroleum products used by the manufacturers was given by different states separately
 waite lagane se bad jaataa he karhaalanki jiesti lagu hone ke baad utpaadit maal parjiastilagta he, jabaki vinirmaan main prayukt petroleum utpaadon par waite lagane se kar bad jaataa he
 In view of this, some states had reduced the VAT rate on compressed natural gas used in the first goods of the GST regime by 5 per cent
 kuch rajya main vinirmaan kshetra main prayukt dijal par bhi waite kii dar kam thi
 In order to reduce the rate of VAT, Arun Jaitley has also requested other states to explore the possibility of reducing the rate of VAT on those petroleum products used in manufacturing, which have a minimum effect on GST, so as to have a minimum impact on the cost of goods

 The grocery stores depend on everyday needs, but after a year of demonetisation, has the grocery store run on digital payments or is it still dependent on cash? For the investigation, we asked the grocery store how to pay for everyday items, then the answer was also from cash and also from Paytm
 khatm nahin ho paaya he cash kaa chalandukandaar kaa kahana he ki zyaadaatar graahak ab petm ke jariye pement karne lage hai, lekin online bhugtan ke duusare madhyam kiraanaa store tak nahin pahunche hai
 The shopkeeper believes that after demonetisation many customers are now using gateways like Paytm but the trend of cash has not stopped

 The man Musafir, who was sitting in a bus going towards South Delhi, also said that he had not yet been brought up due to digital transaction
 bas main baithi duusari mahila musafir se bhi hamane notebandi ke 1 saal baad uske asar ke bare main poocha
 The lady traveler said in two words that neither the demonetisation achieved anything or any change, the loss of people was reversed and many lost their jobs

 When we asked why online or digital payment was not there, the answer of the fruit seller was not known about all these things
 haath main smartphone to tha, lekin online pement kaise karen isaki jaankaree hi nahin
 The next stop was the medical store after the option of card payment received at the medical store
 sardi khaansee kii davaaiyaan leni to thi, lekin agar cash naa ho to kya dawaai le paaenge yaa nahin? medical store vaale ne jawaab diya ki haa, cash nahin he to card pement kar sakate hai
 The medical store's answer was also that most of the people here have started paying with cards and the number of cash customers has come down

 chidambaram kii ek badi baadha dur gai he
 The Supreme Court rejected the application to make Chidambaram a co-accused, saying there was no evidence against him to make him an accused
 supreme court ne kaha ki aisa koi sakshya nahin he, jisase yah sabit hota ho ki chidambaram ne is maamle main aarthik laabh uthaaya he
 Significantly, Subramanian Swamy filed a petition in the Supreme Court against Chidambaram and appealed to make him an accused
 supreme court ne maamle kii sunwaayee puri hone ke baad faisla surakshit rakhaa tha
 Now the decision has been reached in the case

 Amid the debate to reduce the edge of the Right to Information Act (RTI), Union Minister Vilas Rao Deshmukh believes that due to easy access to government files, officials are starting to feel scared to vote on those issues and look into the issue should be done
 kendriya vigyaan praudyogiki or bhu vigyaan mantri deshmukh ne kaha, artiai ne dayera bahut badha diya he
 There is nothing confidential left
 mantrimandal ke faislon se lekar adhikari jo vichaar dete hai, sab kuch is adhikaar ke madhyam se dekhe ja sakate hai
 He said that the liberal use of RTI has caused fear among the officials to cast their vote on any issue
 mantri ke mutabik, iske chalate adhikari kisi bhi file par apana mat darj karaane main ashankit hone lage hai
 a Joint Secretary has the right to reject the votes of an Under Secretary, but now even a Joint Secretary thinks 10 times before giving a file noting
 unhone kaha ki adhikariyon ko dar lagane laga he ki unke faisle par sawaal uthaae jaaenge or unhen spashtikaran dene ke liye bula liya jayega

 Challenging Prahar's study, Anpum Manur on ndt
com has written that jobs have reduced, but not all is over
 prahaar ne bhi nahin kaha he ki sab kuch samaapt ho gaya he
 However, Prahar claimed in his survey to have done a close study of the data of the Labor Bureau, according to which
 
 
 2015 main sirf 1 lakh 35 hazaar naukariyon kaa hi srijan kiya gaya
 In 2013, 4 lakh 19 thousand jobs were created
 2013 se 2015 ke bich baari giravat ai he
 In April 2015, a report was published by Madan Sabanvis and Anuja Shah, Chief Economists of CARE Ratings

 In 2014, more than 11 lakh 88 thousand jobs have been added
 2015 main sirf 12,760 nai naukariyaan hi jodi gai hai
 No one is bothered about the rapid decline in jobs in more than 1000 companies and people are confused about how the procession will come out in front of the temple and the statue immersion procession in front of the mosque

 In the report of Care Ratings, there is a growth of 20 percent in the IT sector, but a report has been published in today's Business Standard on October 19, according to which jobs in IT sector are not much but are decreasing
 ahmedabad, pune or mumbai se bijness standard ke teen samvaadadaataaon ne report file kii he ki ejineering collejon main naukariyaan kam aa rahi hai or selary main oochaal nahin he
 According to a Business Standard report, the campus sector may see a 20 percent drop in campus jobs this year compared to last year
 iti sector main pichley chah saal se basic ofer 3 se saadhe teen lakh prati varsh hi bana hua he
 In mid-level engineering colleges, most of them get jobs on this salary
 is hisaab se dekhen to selary main negative growth ho jaati he
 One reason is that a large number of engineers have become available in the market
 isliye bhi unki shuruaati selary main pichley chah saal main koi vruddhi nahin he
 That is, six years ago, an engineer gets a job on three lakhs, after six years the batch also joins on the same salary, whereas the fees of college fees and education must have increased in these six years
 bijness standard ne kai collejon ke placement cell se baat kar likhaa he ki campus aane vaali companiyon kii sankhya main to kami nahin he, magar naukariyon kii sankhya kam rahane ke anumaan hai

 The Business Standard report published a statement by Chris Lakshmikant, chairman of Head Hunter India, that the top three companies like Infosys, Wipro and TCS employed two lakh new engineers every year, but now the number has come down to 70 to 80 thousand
 is
 iskaa kaaran yah bhi he ki banking, finans sector or beemaa kshetra main tehraav aayaa he
 From there, these IT companies are not getting business, but jobs in manufacturing and public sector companies can increase
 agar aap care retings ke aankade dekhenge to
 
 
 The growth rate in manufacturing sector in 2015 was -5
 2 pratishat darj hui he
 Last year in banking sector only 2
 1 fisadi rahi he
 Any number of jobs growth in manufacturing sector gives us -5
 2 pratishat ke anupaat main hi dekhnaa hoga
 One more thing to note is that all these figures are not official
 alag-alag research agenciyon ke hai
 It is good that the government would release such figures, but will the government also accept the Labor Bureau data that in 2015, more than one lakh thirty five thousand jobs have not increased

 puraani kahawat he ki diya bujhane se pehle fadafadaata jarur he, iesas kii haalat ab kuch aisi hi he
 Baghdadi henchmen are badly engulfed in both Iraq and Syria
 bhaagane ke liye rasta nahin mil rahaa
 Don't want to surrender for fear of Baghdadi
 lihaaja maut or shikast se pehle wo dehshat or vahshat kaa aakhri khel khel rahe hai
 And in this game, before be driven from a city, they beheaded the hundred people held hostage in a college
 mosul ko fateh karne kii koshish main mitra deshon ke saath iraqi fouj ne mosul ke kareebi shahar hamaam al-aleel par dobaaraa kabja hasil kar liya he
 But when the Iraqi army reached the building of a college in the city after occupation, the spirit trembled upon seeing the scene there
 shahar ke ek college kii khaali padi imaarat main ek saath sau logon kii sir kati laashen milin
 Mosul is required to occupy Hamam al-alil
 At this time, Mosul is the only place in Iraq, where ISIS militants still occupy, while Iraqi forces are continuously moving towards terrorist bases
 mosul tak pahunchane ke liye iraqi sena ko hamaam-al-aleel se hokar guzarana tha or yahaan bhi aies kaa kabja tha
 Therefore, it was necessary that Mosam should be captured before Mosul was conquered
 bhaagane se pehle aatankiyon ke kaate bandhankon ke sirisi silsile main fouj ne somvaar ko mosul hamaam al-aleel par bhi kabja kar liya
 After this capture, the truth of corpses was revealed in the college
 maare gaye wo begunaah log the jinhone iesas kaa saath dene se inkaar kar diya tha or iesas ne unhen bandhak bana rakhaa tha
 It is being said that when the terrorists came to the news of the entry of the Iraqi army into the city, they cut off the heads of all hundred people made hostages before fleeing
 ab tak kii jang main 900 aatanki dherais ke liye yahaan halaat kitne najuk ho chuke hai, iskaa andaja bas isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki ek taraf to in aatankwaadiyon kaa sargana abu bakar al bagdadi apane aatankwaadiyon se audio massej ke jariye aakhri dam tak ladane kii baat kah rahaa he, vahiin khabaron ke mutabik bagdadi khud mosul se bhaag kar syria main ja chupa he
 On the other hand, the American army has claimed that about 900 terrorists have been killed in the battle of Mosul in the last eleven days of fighting
 haalanki ab tak fujen mosul ke aas-paas ke ilaakon main hi lard rahi thi, lekin ab unka thikaana mosul shahar he, jahaan or bhayanak ladaai kii ashanka he kyonki aatankwaadiyon ne yahaan shahriyon ko apana dhaal bana rakhaa he
 'surrender or else eat the bullet' The work of rounding up the terrorists of Baghdadi has started from three sides
 bas ek rasta in aatankiyon ke liye choda gaya he, jisase wo apni jaan bachaane ke liye bhaag saken
 But this path is also the way to death
 duniya ke liye dehshat kaa farmaan jari karne waalon ke liye ye aakhri elaan he
 Raise your hand and surrender, or else eat bullets on the back like fools and go where you trick the youth of the world and join your clan of terror
 mosul chhodkar bhaag chukaa he bagdadiaatank kii khilaafat khatre main he
 Now there is no one to listen to the Fatwas of Baghdadi
 uske aatanki yaa to jameen par bich chuke hai yaa jaan bachaane ke liye mosul se kinarakshi kar rahe hai
 But Baghdadi is intent on making the entire sky ruddy before the sun of terror sets
 haalanki maut ke dar se bagdadi khud to mosul chhodkar bhaag gaya he magar apane dajjalon ko kaul de rahaa he
 Kill kill kill before you kill
 iraqi sena ke oparation mosul se itnaa to saaf ho gaya he ki arab kii jis retili jameen par dhaai saal pehle aatank kaa kaala suraj uga tha, ab bas wo doobane vaala he
 Preparing to be surrounded and the black shadow of terror is disappearing from the map of the mosque
 teen taraf se bagdadi ke aatankiyon ko iraqi sena, kurdish sena or shiya milicia ne gher liya gaya he or iraq ke mosul se syria ke rakka kii taraf jane vaala rasta khaali choda gaya he
 So that the terrorists try to escape from this path and a large bridge which falls in the path has already been broken as part of the strategy to surround these terrorists
 dakshini kii taraf se mosul city par kabje ke liye aage bad rahi iraqi senaaon ne kareeb ek darjan or gaavon par apana kabja waapas hasil kar liya he or ab wo mosul ke airport se mahaj 4 kimi kii duuri tak pahunch chuki he
 On the other hand, the Kurdish Peshmerga Army has captured Bashika, the eastern side of Mosul
 mosul city se bashika kii duuri mahaj 13 kimi he
 The Shia Militia army, known as the Popular Mobilization Force on the northern eastern part of Mosul and the borders with Syria, including Sunni fighters who have tightened their grip on ISIS and surrounded the terrorists with their accounts Is taking jari he logon kaa palaayankul milakar arab kii jis retili jameen par bagdadi ne aatank kaa kaala jhanda gaada tha wo ukhdane vaala he
 Now just waiting for the announcement
 15 lakh kii aabaadi vaale mosul shahar se kareeb teen lakh log pehle hi bhaag chuke hai
 Now after the Iraqi army's ascent, about one lakh people are leaving Mosul and heading towards Syria and Turkey
 darasal mosul ke logon ko khatra ye he ki haar kareeb dekh kar aies ke aatankwaadi unhen apni dhaal bana sakate hai
 IS has started this as well
 wo tel ke kuen main aag lagane ke saath-saath sadakon par tel phenk kar unamem bhi aag laga rahaa he
 Defeat in Mosul means the elimination of ISIS is necessary for independence of the city of Mosul
 darasal june 2014 main mosul par kabja karne ke baad bagdadi ne ise na sirf apane aatank ke samrajya kii rajdhani banaaya
 Rather, he also announced his own Khilafat from here
 isliye agar mosul main bagdadi kii shikast hoti he to jaahir taur par iskaa matlab he iraq se islamic state kaa khaatmaa
 Not only this, Mosul has a huge stock of oil
 
 If this city goes by hand, then a major source of IS earnings will be closed
 iske baad iraq ke mahaj 10 fisadi hisse par hi aies kaa prabhaav rah jayega
 The terrorists are putting in oil wells, according to the Pentagon, the Iraqi army is moving ahead of its intended target
 haalanki ye bhi andeshaa jataayaa ja rahaa he ki aatankiyon se mosul ko khaali karaane kii ye jang lambii khinch sakati he
 There are also signs of this
 aatanki iraqi sena ko mosul main daakhil hone se rokane ke liye javaabi karrwai main kisi bhi had tak ja rahe hai
 Apart from targeting army tanks, terrorists are spreading oil inside the city and setting it on fire
 jisase puure shahar main dhuen kaa jabardast gubaar uth rahaa he
 And under this guise, they are preparing a way of escape for themselves
 logon kii jaan ko he bada khatraek taraf jahaan mosul kaa ye mahayuddh pratishtha kaa sawaal ban chukaa he
 At the same time, there is growing concern about the safety of 1
5 million people living in the city
 andeshaa he ki aatanki apni jaan bachaane ke liye aam logon kaa dhaal kii tarah istemaal kar sakate hai
 Therefore, to deal with such a situation, the Iraqi army has dropped a large number of leaflets on the city of Mosul
 jisamen aam logon ko naseehat di ja rahi he ki ladaai ke dauraan apni suraksha ke liye unhen kya karnaa he
 The United Nations fears that about one lakh Iraqis may have to flee Syria or Turkey to save their lives due to the fighting in Mosul
 iraq main aatankiyon ke khauf se kareeb teen lakh se zyada log pehle se hi apane apane gharon ko chhodkar ja chuke hai
 Therefore, in the event of such a situation, arrangements have already been started to help the refugees
 mosul ko aatankiyon ke changul se reeha karaane ke liye shuru hue is oparation kii taiyaari kareeb ek maheene se chal rahi thim
 The Iraqi army has not even reached Mosul, but the terrorists are seen in a hurry
 jaankaar maan rahe hai ki iraq main islamic state ke puri tarah khatme kii ulti ginati shuru ho chuki he kyonki iraq kaa yahi shahar abhi bhi aies kaa garh he
 His feet have been uprooted from other areas
 syria main bhi sirf rakka shahar main hi islamic state kaa kabja rah gaya he
 In such a situation, the defeat of Mosul will be the biggest defeat of Baghdadi ever
 haivaaniyat ke video aae samnebagdadi ke khilaaf aakhri jang ke dauraan iraqi fouj ke haath kuch aise video lage hai jinamein bagdadi ke gargon kii haivaaniyat kaid hai
 In one such video, terrorists are seen shooting fifty innocents simultaneously at an anonymous hideout in Iraq
 baad main in tamaam laashon ko ek kabr main ek saath dafna diya jaataa he
 The ISIS militants are dragging the innocent hostages on the path of death by tying them in the eyes
 in begunaahon kaa kasoor sirf itnaa he ki ye sabhi iraqi shiya muslim hai or bagdadi inako apni hukumat ke liye khatra maanata he
 And only in this crime, Baghdadi has stamped the death sentence issued in his name
 ek hi kabr main utaara maut ke ghatiske baad pehle to inhen bhed bakriyon kii tarah baandh kar kaabo kiya jaataa he or phir aatankwaadi inhen gadiyon main bharkar inaki jindagi ke aakhri safar par nikal jate hai
 Such a journey, with the completion of which the lives of all these hostages have to be fullstop
 or phir tamaam aatankwaadi in 50 begunaah logon ko lekar ek aisi sunsaan jagah par pahunchate hai, jahaan pehle se hi aatankwaadiyon ne apane dushmano ko thikaane lagane ke liye jameen par bada sa gaddha khod rakhaa he
 What is this pit, a mass grave, which has been dug before death
 or phir maukey par pahunchate hi ye aatankwaadi vahi kaam karte hai, jiske khauf se ye sabhi ke sabhi bandhak pehle se hi sihar rahe hai hai
 First they are kneeled down and then shot in the head one by one and thus they are buried together at the place of death
 sutron kii maane to ye ek aisa video he, jo abhi-abhi iraqi fouj ke haath laga he lekin is katleam ko thik kab anjaam diya gaya, philhal is baat kii tasdik honi abhi baaki he
 Preparing to end the game of Baghdadi hidden in Raqqa, ISIS is already surrounded in Iraq
 syria main bhi us par tej hamalon kaa silsilaa jari he
 The Kurdish fighters as well as the Syrian army have made special plans to crush it in Syria, considered a stronghold of ISIS
 udhar iraqi shahar mosul main chalati aar-paar kii ladaai or idhar syria main iesas ko uske sabase bade garh yani raka main gherne kii ye taiyaari
 Such a difficult situation for ISIS has never happened in the last two years, but now the days of ISIS are just getting lost
 aatankwaadiyon kaa sabase bada sargana abu bakar al bagdadi jahaan mosul se bhaag kar isi raka shahar main aa chupa he, vahiin syrian fouj or kurdish fiter bagdadi or uske aatankwaadiyon ko chaaron taraf se gherne kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 According to an estimate, the army is surrounding the Raqqa, at present, there are about five thousand ISIS militants hiding in Raqqa with two lakh Sunni towns, who have captured this entire city in a way
 jabaki 30 hajaar se zyada kurdish fiteron or syrian phogiyon ne chaaron taraf se raka ko gherne kii shuruyaat kar di he
 And here, just like Mosul, in the areas around Raqqa, the war of militants with terrorists continues
 drone kii madad le rahi he senasyrian raashtrapati bashar al asad kii madad kar rahi roosi fouj jahaan aatankwaadiyon ke thikaanon par bambaari kar rahi he, vahiin kurdish fiteron ne ab aatankwaadiyon kaa muqabla karne ke liye commercial drone camaron kaa istemaal shuru kar diya he
 
 
 Actually, due to these drones, the photos of the intelligence base of the terrorists are easily available to the army
 or isse unka safaya karnaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 Terrorist guerrillas are waging war in both Syria and Iraq
 inhone badi badi mashiinon ke saare shahar main surang khod rakhe hai, jinka istemaal wo chupane ke liye to karte hi hai, jarurat ke mutabik in surangon se hokar wo hamale bhi karte hai
 In such a situation, drones are proving to be an important means of hiding terrorists

 Said that the success of the parliamentary elections will be repeated in the Bihar elections as well
 
 unhone kaha he ki jis tarah desh main pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa vikalp vipaksh ke paas nahin he, thik vaise hi bihar main nitish kumaar kaa bhi koi vikalp nahin he
 Sushil Modi tweeted that just as the leaders of the opposition parties could not provide an alternative to Prime Minister Narendra Modi before the parliamentary elections, similarly the Grand Alliance will not be able to give an alternative to Nitish Kumar in Bihar
 unhone daawa kiya ki endie vidhansabha chunaav main sansadeey chunaav kii safalataa ko shandaar aakandon ke saath doharayega
 Earlier, Sushil Modi tweeted on his return from abroad on a trip that Nitish Kumar is the captain of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar and under his leadership the 2020 assembly election will be contested
 bijepi ke bheetar se nitish ke netritv par uthaae ja rahe sawaal ko bhi unhone sire se khaarij kar diya tha

 Those who do not have any vision of better service to the state, what can they do except to make rhetoric on the cm-candidate every day? This tweet of Sushil Modi caused panic among BJP leaders from Patna to Delhi
 party ke kai netaaon ne to susheel modi ke is bayaan ko sire se khaarij kar diya tha
 Significantly, the politics of the Chief Minister's post in Bihar NDA was intensified when Sanjay Paswan of BJP MLC had openly demanded to hand over the Chief Minister's chair from Nitish Kumar to the allies

 The NDA is currently headed by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in Bihar, but who will be the Chief Ministerial candidate in 2020 is not yet decided
 haalanki, seepi thakur ne hi janata dal united (jediu) ke 'naare kyon karen vichaar, thike to he nitish kumaar' par bhi aapatti jataai thi
 He said that Nitish is doing a good job, so why this slogan? saarvajanik parivahan ko behatar karne ke liye dilli sarkaar is saal rajdhani kii sadakon par 3,000 or bason ko utaaregi

 In an old TV advertisement in Tehelka, a leader is giving a speech at a village nook and occasionally utters a few words like "education" and "unemployment"
 achaanak kauwon kii kaanv-kaanv se log baichaiyn ho uthte hai
 Crows are strewn around on trees, on electric wires, on hand pumps
 udhar, bhaashan jari tha, tabhi ek kauwa microphone par aa baithta he or netaa kii bolti band ho jaati he
 With this comes the screen, "jhooth bole crow kate" and then emerges, the full-bearded face of Tarun Tejpal with Tehelka's masthead (magazine name)
 baat tab kii he jab tahalaka saptahik tebloid hua karata tha
 The message was simple
 angreji ke ‘‘tii’’ se bane teen akshar ek-duusare ke paryaayavachi ban gaye the
 That is Teejpal from T, Tehelka from T, and Truth from T

 At the same time, on two occasions, on 7 and 8 November, this black act of alleged sexual harassment takes place
 do saal pehle, isi mahotsav ke udghaatan ke dauraan tejpal ne shirkat karne waalon se kaha tha ki khao, pio, mouj karo or jo pasand ho, uske saath hambistar ho jaao
 Tejpal is accused of forcing his junior colleague into the lift
 is junior sahyogi ko di nero ke swaagat-satkar kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya tha
 It is also a strange coincidence that the theme of the first day of the festival was rape and "demon sitting among us"
 us junior sahyogi ke tahalaka kii managing editor shoma choudhary ke paas likhit shikaayat bhejne ke ek din baad 19 november ko tejpal ne use sidhe email kiya ki ‘‘tumhen yaad hoga ki us abhaagi shaam kii hamaari baatcheet khaasi raseeli thi

 ’’ shoma choudhary ab managing editor pad se istipha de chuki hai
 The next day, on November 20, the 27-year-old woman responded to Tejpal for the first time after the allegations were made public and denied each of them
 usne tejpal ko likhaa ki 7 november kii raat baatcheet katai raseeli yaa halki-phulki nahin thi-‘‘aap sex yaa vaasana kii baaten isliye kar rahe the kyonki aap mujhase amuman waisi baaten karte rahe hai or durbhaagya se kabhi aapane mere kaam ke bare main baatcheet nahin kii

 You did not mind, but the next night also tried to force me

 At Tehelka's editorial meetings, we often considered "why men become animals
" ’’ or jab hota tha ki purush main inkaar sunne kii kshamta nahin hoti
 The matter was to be made public that there was a queue of resignations from the magazine
 puraane dost saarvajanik rup se ninda karne lage to 50 varshiya tejpal apane tevar or bayaan baar-baar badalane lage
 On 23 November, he withdrew his unconditional apology and wrote in a text message, "my life and work are being destroyed by a lie
 ’’phir unhone kaha ki goa kii bijepi sarkaar unhen ‘‘fansaa’’ rahi he
 Finally, he reached the Delhi High Court on November 26 with an anticipatory bail application
 arji main kaha ki ‘‘kathith aarope puri tarah jhooth hai or buree niyat se baad main gadhe gaye hai
 He later withdrew the application

 On the other hand, Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar, who is overseeing the investigation of the case, has denied that his special interest in this case is politically motivated
 tejpal ne goa police se nivedan kiya ki unhen 30 november ko pesh hone kii ijaajat di jaae lekin unke aagrah ko thukraa kar giraftaar kaa gaiyr-jamaanti warrant jari kar diya gaya
 Like every scam, there has been a political war in this case

 Political lines regarding Tejpal were drawn before Tehelka's 2001 West End operation
 isaki ek vajah yah rahi ki gandhi parivaar ne unki baari prashansa kii thi
 In 1997, when Priyanka Gandhi and her husband Robert Vadra got into a controversy over the allotment of a government bungalow, Tejpal wrote a diary item in Outlook, "she (priyanka) is very beautiful and maintains a dignified ease, or else she is of that age

 unhen iskaa mauka kuch samay ke liye india 2000 main mila or phir 1988 main india today ke copy desk par unhen naukari mil gai

 He started forming his own team in the Sunday magazine of Financial Express, which accepted his style of leadership and considered a boss who gives him a lot of freedom
 1995 main tejpal outluk se managing editor ke rup main jude

 Tejpal, along with photographer Sanjeev Seth, started publishing under the name India Inc, which published the Booker Award winning book The God of Small Things
 tarun jo bhi chhu rahe the, vah cheez sona ho ja rahi thi
 Then came the time when Tejpal found it ideal to start Tehelka Dotcom for the idealistic, angry, truth-telling person within him

 On March 14, 2001, the website sparked a sting showing BJP President Bangaru Laxman taking bribe

 Then, the then Defense Minister George Fernandes had to resign after Operation Westend

 This operation raised the height of Tejpal significantly
 iske baad khaskar tivi chounalon ne to kai tarah ke sting oparation kiye or chizon ko dekhne kaa media kaa najariya badla
 In just 17 years, Tejpal went from a quiet, polite editor who edited stories for a new course at the University of Punjab, to a Virat editor who tilted the central government

 But Tejpal's success did not stay away from controversies

 Many journalists accused him of serving his business interests through these stores
 tejpal akasar thodaa garv ke saath kaha karte hai ki tahalaka ek ‘‘vicharya kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 Although this idea promotes his own personal craze, it is also representative of the liberal leftist philosophy and Tejpal is its fiercest warrior
 yah vichaar arajak tha or isane bane rahane ke liye alag-alag disha main kai rup liye

 Dhawal's beard, braided hair, ornate-laden Tejpal's friends line up with film actors Aamir Khan to Tina Brown
 ye sab unke aakarshak vyaktitv ke aashna log hai
 All these remained his friends even when Tejpal ignored the original idea of tehelka or went to such an extent that the news published in Tehelka and the money in it remained unconnected
 tejpal ke kathith ucch vichaaron par sabase tikhaa tanj kathith yon utpeeda kaa shikaar hui mahila kii taraf se aayaa
 For the second time, on November 8, the day of the incident of sexual harassment, Tejpal sent a strict SMS to the victim girl
 isamen ve ladki ko is baat ke liye fatkaar rahe the ki usne is ghatana ke bare main tejpal kii beti tia ko kyon bataaya?tejpal ne massej main likhaa, ‘‘mujhe is baat kaa bilkul bharosa nahin tha ki tum itani maamuli baat jaakar use (tia ko) bataa dogi
 This shows that you do not even know about the father-daughter relationship
 ’’ mahila patrkaar ne iskaa karaara jawaab diya, ‘‘main is baat par yakeen nahin kar sakati ki ek to apni beti kii umr kii karmchaaree, duusare tumhaare dost kii beti kaa yon utpeeda karne ko aap ‘‘maamuli baat’’ samajhate hai
 The ideas for which the Tehelka is known, do not have even a small effect on you
 ’’yah gandi kahani sirf isliye mahatvapurn nahin he ki iskaa kendriya charitra charchit patrkaar he jo samanta, bharosa or paardarshita ke unheen siddhanton ke liye khadey hone kii baat karata rahaa he jiske ulanghan ke us par aarope lage hai
 This would prove to be a litmus test for sexual abuse and rape in the workplace in urban and elite India
 tejpal ke vakil ab ladki ke bayaan main khaamiyon kii talash kar rahe hai jo ghatana ke unke bataae varjan ke vipareet shuru se ab tak bilkul nahin badla he
 They are questioning why she was present at the think event after the incident and how she continued to "party" despite the alleged sexual misconduct
 ’’ ve yah mudda bhi uthaa rahe hai ki tahalaka management ko isaki jaankaree das din ke baad 18 november ko kyon di gai
 According to senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, Tejpal's main defense may simply be that the girl was adult and it was with her consent
 bachaav kaa ek or tark yah ho saktaa he ki domanjila imaarat kii lift main yon durvyavhaar kar paanaa asambhav lagata he
 According to senior lawyer Aman Lekhi, the girl's side is strong
 uske tark main sabase vajandaar baat tejpal kaa likhaa gaya patr he, jisamen tejpal ne yah maan liya he ki unhone uski marji ke bina usase avaidh sambandh banane kii koshish kii
 Lekhi said that the case cannot be weakened by the behavior of the victim after the incident
 unhone kaha, ‘‘yah kehete hue ki ghatana se pehle un donon ke bich baatcheet flarting vaali thi, tejpal ne yah galat dharna bana lee ki peedita apane saath kisi bhi vyavhaar ke liye taiyaar rahegi
 Once, he even tried to tell her that he was her boss
 ’’shuruyaat main jab ladki kaa i-mail li hua tab shoma choudhary or tejpal tivi or soshal media par sabase zyada cheer-faad ke vishay ban gaye
 It is clear that the Tehelka team's response was more professional, less emotional, even more clumsy
 iske vipareet ladki ke letters main jutaaye gaye saakshyon ke saath spashtataa thi
 The agility and promptness with which the Goa Police acted has surprised the people of this smallest state in India
 isse tejpal kheme ke log chaukanne ho gaye or isamen unhen bijepi kii sajeesh kii bu aane lagi
 The Goa Police, taking suo motu recollection of the rarely used CRPC 154 provision, reinforced Tejpal's allegation that there was a political agenda behind it
 apni agrim jamaanat kii yachika main tejpal ne kaha ki party ne ‘‘exiar ke chhadam rup main unase apana badla liya he
 "but the Chief Minister of Goa reacts sharply to this," when he held the ceremony in Goa, first apologizing for it or went on retirement (in Tejpal's words, atonement for the charges leveled against him to protect himself
 To do) Then he did not realize that there is a BJP government there

 Police sources say the alleged victim described the incident as "clean, frank and meticulous"
 usne saavdhaneepurvak unhen aparaadh ke pehle or baad ke i-mail bhi dikhaae
 She was asked why she went into the lift with Tejpal for the second time and why she took so long to file a complaint
 ek adhikari ne bataaya, ‘‘peedita kaa maukhik bayaan usase bilkul miltaa he jo usne apane i-mail main likhaa he’’ iske baad ladki 27 november ko magistrate ke saamne bayaan darj karaane ke liye flite se goa gai
 Her friends, who spoke to the girl, said that she was tired, upset but looked determined
 tejpal ne agar sochaa hoga ki praayshchit kar lene se maamla dab jayega to yah daanv ulataa padaa he
 The crime of his crime increased manifold as the context has changed now
 dilli gang rape ke baad shahari bharat ek alag duniya ban chukaa he jahaan sadakon or sibrespes kaa nyaay utana hi prabhavi ho chukaa he, jitna adaalaton main sunaae jane vaale faisle
 Tejpal, who looks serious with a beard, looks like a star in Anant in a framed poster of the promotion released at the launch of Tehelka and the sentence printed in it seems to predict a mistake, "you can't change the truth 
 lekin satya aapako badal saktaa he
 "there cannot be a better message for an organization that stands on the sublime concept of mass journalism, and the founder of that organization, Tejpal, one of the best minds in the Indian media, is now facing a life-changing truth

 The sensation of Australia's attack James Pattinson said that he got the precious wicket of Sachin Tendulkar by luck but he will not forget it
 tendulkar ko 41 ran par out karne vaale patinson ne kaha, ‘‘sachin ko out karnaa aisa he jise main taumr nahin bhul paaungaa
 It was very special
 lekin bhagya unke saath nahin tha kyonki gend kaaphi baahar ja rahi thi

 jis tarah se vah rakshaatmak shot khel rahe the usase aapako lagata he ki unako out karnaa mushkil he lekin yadi aap acchhee gendbaaji karte to prayek ballebaaj ko out kar sakate ho
 The 21-year-old batsman denied that everyone wants Tendulkar to score his 100th international century and hence he is doing well as a bowling unit
 unhone kaha, ‘‘aapako wicket lene ke liye unhen haaavee hone se rokna hoga
 Right now our bowlers are performing very well
 ham sabhi jaanate hai ki yadi ham acchhee gendbaaji nahin karenge to ve hamen baikfoot par bhej sakate hai
 "pattinson feels that apart from Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag is the other Indian batsman who can dominate his bowlers
" unhone kaha, ‘‘vah jis tarah ke shot kheltaa he to vah 100 ran banane main samay nahin lagayegaa
 The same applies to VVS Laxman
 vah isse pehle australia ke khilaaf kaaphi safal rahe hai
 They are trying to dominate us and are trying to score runs from the cover in the beginning
 unhen lagata he ki yadi ve gendbaajon par akraman karte hai to phir anubhavheen akraman par haaavee ho jaaenge
 We did not let this happen
 ’’ patinson ne victoria ke apane saathi peter sidle ke 100 wicket lene par bhi khushi jataai

 Jaishankar was arrested from the southern suburbs of Bangalore

 The Supreme Court has reserved the verdict on Sabarimala
 supreme court kii paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth tay karegi ki 28 sitambar ke faisle ko badla jaae yaa nahin
 In the court, the Kerala government said, "challenging on untouchability or on other grounds does not affect the decision
 jo bhi dharmik pratha samvidhan ke khilaaf he, use janaa hoga
 The practice is a matter of fundamental rights
 sabarimala main mahilaon ko baahar rakhana hindu dharm kaa abhinn hissaa nahin kyonki duusare ayappa mandiron main aisa nahin he'vahiin faisle par punarvichaar chaahane vaale yachikakartaon ke taraf se daleel di gai ki kerala ke logon ne supreme court ke faisle ko sweekaar nahin kiya he jiske chalate rajya main ashaanti he
 The court cannot compel the people of the state to accept their verdict on this side
 travnakor devasam board ne kaha ki mahilaon ko pravesh milanaa chahie
 Justice Indu Malhotra asked that you change your stand? So the board said that we respect the decision
 bataa den, isse sase pehle board ne mahilaon ke pravesh kaa virodh kiya tha
 The five-member constitution bench of the Supreme Court is hearing the reconsideration petitions
 chif justise ranjan gogoi, justise rohinton fali nariman, justise e em khanvilakar, justise divai chandrachud or justise indu malhotra kii bench sunwaayee kar rahi he
 When the hearing commenced, the CJI said, "we have 54 reconsideration petitions, some pils and some transfer petitions
" aap pehle kis par bahes karnaa chahenge
 At the same time, k Parasaran, who appeared in the court on behalf of the Nair Service Society, said that there were some flaws in the decision given in the month of September
 bataa den, supreme court ne pichley saal 28 sitambar ko 4-1 ke bahumat se faisla sunaate hue mandir main sabhi umr kii mahilaon ko pravesh kii ijaajat di thi
 The court quashed the ban on the entry of women between 10 and 50, terming them gender-based discrimination
 kareeb 54 punarvichaar yachikaayen daakhil kar court ko is faisle par punarvichaar karne kii maang kii gai he
 Significantly, four women filed a petition in the Supreme Court requesting intervention as a party in support of the landmark verdict regarding the Sabarimala temple in September last year
 is faisle main kerala ke sabarimala mandir main 10 se 50 varsh tak kii pratibandhit ayuvarg kii mahilaon ko bhi pravesh kii anumati di gai thi
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to keep the officials close to the government away from the new government during the UPA government
 ajtak ke paas cramic vibhaag kii wo chitthee he jisamen pradhanmantri karyaalay se mili disha nirdesh kaa ullekh karte hue aadesh jari kiya gaya he
 According to this order, the staff of ministers in the UPA government will not be appointed as staff of ministers of the new government
 ye niyam sarkari vyakti ke saath-saath nijee logon par bhi lagu hoga
 It is so strict that it can be estimated from this that even if you have worked as a ministerial staff in the UPA government for 1 day, then it cannot get a place in the new government
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ek baar phir apane sabhi mantriyon ko aagaah kiya he ki wo kisi bhi surat main pichhali sarkaar kaa koi bhi afasar yaa karmchaaree mantriyon ke nijee staff main nahin rakhe jaae
 The Prime Minister has also made it clear that even if a minister of the previous government kept a private man in his staff, he should be removed from the staff of the ministry
 yahaan tak ki afasar hi nahin balki stano, typist jaise nichle str ke karmchaaree bhi badalane honge
 The letter dated 19 June 2014, under the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Ministry of Personnel, in a confidential letter on 19 June 2014, asked all the ministers to take precautions in private staff
 isse pehle carmik mantralay ne ek aise hi patr main mantriyon ko privet secretary or oesady rakhane ke liye khaas hidaayaten di thi
 According to sources, Modi had taken several decisions in this regard after having an important meeting in the Prime Minister's Office
 1
 Modi told his ministers not to appoint relatives in his staff
 2
 While keeping your personal secretary and OSD, avoid officers associated with the ministers of the previous government
 3
 In his new decree, Modi has instructed the ministers not to place any officer appointed in the staff of ministers in the previous government at any level
 sutron ke mutabiq pichhali kai sarkaron main kai aise nijee sachiv, oesady or mantriyon ke pie jo sam dand bhed kii buniyaad par jod tod karke har sarkaar main mantriyon kaa daaman tham lete the
 Intelligence reports also mentioned that a racket is going on in Delhi court to appoint PA and OSD
 darasal modi apni sarkaar kii chhavi ko isi racket ke daag se bachaana chaahate hai
 According to sources, many ministers have not changed their staff so far
 nai party banane ke baad shivpal yadav apni party pragatisheel samaajawaadee party kii badi raily karne ja rahe hai
 On 9 December, Shivpal Yadav is organizing a public outrage at Ramabai Maidan in Lucknow and claims that like Mayawati, he will also fill this ground with his supporters
 shivpal yadav apane raajnneetik takat kaa ahsaas apni raily ke jariye karana chaahate hai taaki samaajawaadee party or satta paksh donon unki takat ko mahasoos kar sake
 Whether or not Mulayam Singh comes to this rally of Shivpal Yadav, everyone will keep an eye on it, but if Shivpal Yadav believes that Mulayam Singh is with him or not, now it does not matter and he is separated from the family, he has taken the path of Ekla Chalo That is, if someone in the family wants to come with them, then they come, now they are not going to stay for the family
 raily ke 1 din pehle shivpal yadav ne ajtak se khaas baatcheet kii
 It became so clear in the conversation that now whether Mulayam Singh comes with him or not does not matter to Shivpal
 vah apni raah pakad chuke hai
 Even in posters, only Shivpal sees the posters of this rally, only Shivpal is the only Shivpal everywhere and Shivpal's loneliness is also making him special in the rally
 mulaayam singh kii tasviren aupchaariktavash lagaai gai hai lekin postaron main har jagah shivpal 'ekala chalo' kii raah bharte dikh rahe hai
 Shivpal Yadav said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak that whether Mulayam Singh is with him now or not, it does not matter now that he has chosen his path, which should come
 ab yadav parivaar hi unka parivaar nahin balki puraa pradesh unka parivaar he
 Shivpal said that if Mulayam Singh contests the Samajwadi Party, then the party will decide on whether the party will give a candidate against him
 vah apni party se mulaayam singh ko mainpuri seat laana chaahate hai lekin agar vah duusari party se chunaav ladate hai party unke salaah par ummidavaar degi yaa nahin yah party tay karegi
 Shivpal also claimed that Ramabai Maidan will be filled in his rally on December 9 and both BJP and Samajwadi Party will realize their strength
 shivpal kii maane to unki party samaajawaadee party kaa vikalp nahin balki bijepi kaa vikalp bananaa chaahati he
 This is the reason why Shivpal Yadav is connecting all the old faces of Samajwadi Party
 sabhi 75 jilon se kaaryakarta or netaa bulaae gaye hai
 Now it remains to be seen how crowds gather in the rally
 party ke gathbandhan ko lekar bhi shivpal yadav apane pattey nahin khol rahe
 Shivpal said that his entire focus is only on his party
 rahi baat gathbandhan kii to yah chunaav ke vakt dekha jayega philhal party sabhi 80 siton ke liye taiyaari kar rahi he
 Let us know that 2 days before Shivpal's rally, Mulayam Singh Yadav shared the stage with Akhilesh Yadav in Farrukhabad
 samaajawaadee party ke is manch par mulaayam singh yadav lagaataar samaajawaadee party ke kaaryakartaaon kaa utsaah badhaate dikhe iske baad lagbhag saaf ho gaya ki ab mulaayam singh ne bhi apni line khinch di he
 If Mulayam Singh does not go to Shivpal's stage in Sunday's rally, then it will be clear that now Shivpal Yadav will fight his battle alone
 loktantr ke utsav main shariq hone vaale divyang chandrakant doshi ke jazbe ko salaam
 Polio-afflicted Chandrakant Doshi has come to vote continuously for the last 30 years
 wo har baar chunaav main matdaan karke yuva peedi ko yah sandesh dena chaahate hai ki har kisi ko matdaan karnaa chahie
 It is also a festival which should be celebrated
 50 varshiya chandrakant bachapan main hi polio ke shikaar ho gaye the or wheel chair par hai
 On Thursday morning, when Chandrakant reached the polling station to vote for the Doshi Vidhan Sabha elections, he was very excited
 chandrakant doshi ko unki wheelchair se matdaan centre ke andar unke bade bhai lekar gaye or matdaan karavaaya
 After coming out of the polling station, Chandrakant Doshi smiled and said that everyone should use their vote
 yah bhi to ek parv he
 He said that he has been voting continuously for the last 30 years
 chandrakant doshi sab yuvaaon ke liye ek prerana kaa strot he
 In conversation with Aaj Tak, Doshi said that when every citizen will use his vote, only then will the real rise in the country
 unhone kaha ki janata ko muddon par vot dena chahie
 When asked what issues were important to him on which he voted, he said that employment is the biggest and important issue
 sarkaar ko divyangon ke rojgaar ke liye bhi kuch karnaa chahie
 Employment should also be arranged for us
 modi sarkaar ne muslim mahila (vivaah adhikaar sangrakshan) vidheyak-2017 (the Muslim Women (protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill) par ek baadha paar kar lee he
 On Thursday, the Lok Sabha passed the triple talaq bill
 ab is vidheyak (bill) ko rajyasabha main pesh kiya jayega
 If the Modi government also passes this bill in the Rajya Sabha, then it will be sent for the approval of the President
 raashtrapati ke hastakshar hone ke baad yah vidheyak kanoon ban jayega
 The bill will now be discussed in the Rajya Sabha, where the bjp-led NDA government does not have a majority
 teen talaak ke khilaaf is bill main sajaa ke praavdhaan ko lekar vipakshi dal virodh kar rahe hai
 They are also demanding amendments
 loksabhaa main bhi AIMIM netaa asaduddin ovaisi samet anya ne sanshodhan prastaav pesh kiye, lekin samarthan nahin milane se khaarij ho gaye
 Now it is a big challenge for the government to pass this bill from Rajya Sabha
 vahiin, modi sarkaar ke mantri or bijepi teen talaak bill par sahmati banane ke liye vipakshi partiyon se baatcheet main juty hui hai
 The Modi government wants to pass this bill from the Rajya Sabha in this winter session, which is nothing less than crooked
 isaki vajah yah he ki rajyasabha main bijepi kaa bahumat nahin he
 The government hopes, Rajya Sabha will also pass
 After the bill is passed from Lok Sabha, Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that we are confident that the Congress will support the triple talaq bill in Rajya Sabha like Lok Sabha and we will take the bill from Parliament
 Will be able to pass it
 ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki muslim mahilaon ko nyaay dilaane ke liye teen talaak bill aayaa he
 It is associated with the dignity of women and we do not want to interfere in the Sharia
 pakistan sahit kai muslim deshon main bhi teen talaak par roak he
 On Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed hope in the BJP parliamentary meeting that this bill will be passed in both houses of Parliament with the consent of all parties
 iske alaava loksabhaa se teen talaak bill paarit hone ke baad kendriya grahamantri ne bhi rajyasabha main is bill ke paas hone kii ummid jataai
 On Thursday, he said that today is a historic day
 hamen bharosa he ki teen talaak bill rajya sabha main bhi paarit ho jayega
 Passing the bill in the winter session is a big challenge
 Three political parties including Biju Janata Dal (BJD), AIADMK, SP and Trinamool Congress are opposing the three divorce bill
 haalanki in raajnneetik dalon ke saansad loksabhaa mentin talaak bill main sanshodhan prastaav par votingke dauraan anupasthit rahe
 The BJP does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha
 aise main bill ko paas karaane ke liye duusare dalon ke saath kii jarurat he
 The 245-member Rajya Sabha has 88 NDA mps (including 57 BJP mps), 57 of Congress, 18 of SP, 8 of BJD, 13 of AIADMK, 12 of Trinamool Congress and 5 of NCP
 agar sarkaar ko apane sabhi sahyogi dalon kaa saath mil jaataa he, to bhi bill ko paarit karaane ke liye kam se kam 35 or saansadon ke samarthan kii jarurat hogi
 Many opposition parties in the Rajya Sabha can strongly oppose the bill
 in vipakshi dalon kaa kahana he ki bill main sanshodhan kiya janaa chahie or teen saal kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan karnaa galat he
 The BJP also does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha
 aise main bill ko sansadeey samiti ke paas samiksha ke liye bheja ja saktaa he
 If that happened, the passage of the bill in this winter session of Parliament would be difficult
 ovaisi ne chah sanshodhan kii maang kii thithainin pramukh asaduddin ovaisi or congress ke kuch netaa bhi is bill par sanshodhan kii maang kar rahe hai
 Owaisi introduced six amendment proposals on the triple talaq bill in the Lok Sabha, but only two of the amendment proposals were accepted by the House
 haalanki ovaisi ke donon hi sanshodhan prastaav khaarij ho gaye
 He says that this bill is an injustice to Muslim women
 yah muslimon kii swatantraaa kaa ulanghan karata he
 Muslims were not consulted while preparing this bill
 muslim mahilaon ne manaaya jashnatin talaak bill ke loksabhaa main paarit hone ke baad se muslim mahilaon jashn manaa rahi hai
 However, it is necessary to pass this bill in Rajya Sabha, only after which it will be able to take the form of law with the signature of the President
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke sansadeey kshetra varanasi main muslim mahilaon ne pataakhe bhi jalaae
 Since the passage of the law in the Lok Sabha, the hopes of three divorced women have also been set
 SC ne sarkaar ko kanoon banane ke liye diya tha 6 maah kaa samaysupreme court teen talaak yanitlak-e-biddtako pehle hi asanvaidhanik qaraar de chuki he
 On August 22, a five-judge bench of the apex court, by majority, declared the three divorces to be unconstitutional and illegal
 saath hi modi sarkaar se muslim mahilaon ke adhikaron kii raksha ke liye kanoon banane ko kaha tha
 During the discussion on triple talaq bill in Lok Sabha, the government also cited the decision of the Supreme Court
 aisa hoga teen talaak bilimodi sarkaar 'muslim mahila (vivaah adhikaar sangrakshan) vidheyak-2017' naam se is vidheyak ko laai he
 This law will apply only to triple talaq (INSTANT TALAQ, i
e
, divorce-e-biddat)
 is kanoon ke baad koi bhi muslim purush agar apni bibi ko teen talaak degaa, to wo gaiyr-kanoonee hoga
 Henceforth, three divorces granted in any form, whether oral or written and or through message, will be invalid
 jo bhi teen talaak degaa, usko teen saal kii sajaa or jurmaana ho saktaa he yani teen talaak dena gaiyr-jamaanti or sangyeya ( Cognizable) aparaadh hoga
 In this the magistrate will decide how much penalty will be there
 piem narendra modi ne teen talaak par kanoon banane ke liye ek mantri samooh banaaya tha, jisamen rajnath singh, arun jetali, sushamaa swaraj, ravishankar prasad, peepi choudhary or jitendra singh shaamil the
 These are the provisions in the triple talaq bill- it would be illegal to say a triple talaq (speaking, writing or through electronic means like email, SMS and whatsapp) simultaneously
 - aisa karne vaale pati ko teen saal ke karawas kii sajaa ho sakati he
 This would be considered a non-bailable and cognizable offense
 - yah kanoon sirf 'talaak e biddat' yani ek saath teen baar talaak bolne par lagu hoga
 - The victim of divorce can appeal to the Magistrate seeking alimony for himself and minor children
