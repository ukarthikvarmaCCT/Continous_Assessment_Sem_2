 The pain of the 91-year-old Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and its political progeny came to the surface in the minds of the top faces of the BJP

 There were 14 prominent faces of the Sangh including Sarkaryavah Bhaiyyaji Joshi, Sah Sarkaryavah Dattatreya Hosabale, Krishna Gopal, BJP President Amit Shah, General Secretary Ramlal, Ram Madhav

 After this, almost a fortnight, under the supervision of Krishna Gopal, about a dozen such meetings were held, in which separate sessions of Dalit and backward intellectuals took place
 yah jaananaa dilachasp hoga ki bikaner ke saansad arjunaram meghavaal ne aisi hi baithkon main khaase prabhavi dhang se apni baat rakhi, jisane unhen mantri banane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Well, the Sangh and BJP have been more concerned about the fact that they got the support of their cadre in the above cases but the entire group of intellectuals was found to be against it
 aise hi manthanon ke baad jo faisle liye gaye, usee ke tahat pichley maheene dilli ke endiemasi kanvension centre main do din kii nesanalist riters meet bhi hui
 The bloggers and writers mobilized in this, were littered with 'thinkers' of the Sangh and BJP
 haalanki vahaan bhi sangh parivaar main matbhed or you turn jaise sawaalon par krishna gopal bifer pade
 He said that there is nothing like the Sangh Parivar; This jumla was coined in 1992 with the objective of banning all organizations of the Sangh after the collapse of the Babri structure

 Dalit thinker Arvind Neelkanthan, in an event organized by Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Research Foundation (SPMRF)
 bhimrao ambedkar kii soch ko hindu rashtravaadi netaaon ke samaan sabit karne kii koshish kii
 He described Ambedkar's conversion to Buddhism as moving from one room of the house to another
 dalit mudde ko lekar lagaataar baikfoot par chal rahe bijepi-sangh ne lekhakon ko samajhaayaa ki ambedkar ke bahut-se uddharanon se agar unka naam hataakar dekhen to kisi maharishi ke hi vichaar lagenge
 The uneasiness in the Sangh Parivar is actually a result of the irony that it has influence in the political-social sphere but in the intellectual field there is a famine
 haryana bhawan vaali baithak main shaamil rahe ek netaa ke hi shabdon main, ''2004-2009 ke aam chunaav main bijepi haari hui sthiti main bhi 20-22 fisadi vot leti rahi he

 More or less the same crisis arose during NDA-2
 phir pehle apatiai main gajendra chouhan or phir fishan se jude enieft main cricketer rahe chetan chouhan kii niyukti ne to is kheme kii khaasi kirakiri karwaai
 Large sections of the Sangh Parivar believe that the mainstream media is malicious towards him

 He also cast Amit Shah as the villain
 media or buddhijivi varg kii aisi hi vyakhyaaon ko badalane ke liye hamen kaam karnaa he
 "the organization will make a cut of the Left
 Taking advantage of the permanent government, the Sangh Parivar wants to move ahead on this strategy
" so, aise forum khadey kiye ja rahe hai jo bhale swytta hon lekin dakshinpanthi vichaardhaara ke vaahak bane
 Now the Sangh has removed the condition of going to the branch to add people who, while in their profession, can join the Sangh's think forums, so that such people can be identified as fair intellectuals
 aise darjan bhar se zyada sanghathan is vakt vibhinn kshetron main sakriy hai, jo sangh kii shabdaawalee main 'rashtravaadi vichaaron ke' kahe jate hai
 Through seminars, publications, social media, etc
, they are creating new intellectuals to compete against the Left (see graphic)

 BJP vice president and PPRC director Vinay Sahasrabuddhe says, "research on Indian civilization and culture has become a fashion in the West, but India's intellectual environment and research that should have been objective, politics dominates
" sagariya suraksha, bangladeshi ghuspaith par kabhi koi shodh nahin hota, hamaare math-mandiron kii ore se hone vaale anndaan par shodh nahin hota, balki puraani chizon par shodh kii baat kaa makhul udaaya jaataa he

 It is not a coincidence that all the researchers of the Sangh Parivar are termed as Leftists, considered to be milestones used in public context
 sahasrabuddhe ko phir bhi lagata he ki desh main sangh ke prati vaicharik chuaachhut kaa maahaul bana he or sangh vichaar ke chaatro ko achche guide nahin milte yaa unhen achche number nahin die jate
 Back in time, the Sangh, which is feeling less in the group of single minded intellectuals, has more problem than the Left itself
 rajnatik vishleshak yogendra yadav kehete hai, ''bijepi-sangh aaj se 25-30 saal puraani duniya main he jab academix main vamapanthiyon kaa dabadabaa tha
 The second truth is that due to the narrow and negative thinking of the Sangh, the best intellectuals of the country want to remain free from saffron stains
 satta main hone or baantne ko bahut-si revadissan inke paas hone ke baavjood tisare darje ke hi buddhijivi inase jud rahe hai
 "professor Anand Kumar at JNU adds another aspect to his assessment," The sangh-bjp's attitude towards Indian civilization and society lacks historical authenticity

 And the economics of nationalism is irrelevant in today's world
 '' anand kumaar haalanki apana bauddhik aadhaar viksit karne kii sangh parivaar kii pahal kaa swaagat karte hai
 But they also warn that if small and incomplete facts are resorted to instead of absolute truth, then their step of intellectualism will prove to be immediate
 aise to khadey ho chuke buddhijivisang parivaar ko pareshaan karne vaala kanhaiya prakaran 9 farvari ko jab jeenyu main aakaar le rahaa tha, usee din dinadayal shodh santhanmen satya narayan kii katha kii tarj par dinadayal upaadhyaay kii punya tithi par dinadayal katha chal rahi thiah ''bhae pragat krupala dindayala
 Krishna Gopal, Hosabale, etc
 were present there
 aakhir main laddu kaa prasad baanta gaya
 In this way, what intellectual group does the Sangh Parivar want to create? Fearing similar 'antics', a senior BJP leader says,' Our people do not understand the difference between modernism and westernization
 koi paryaavaran, nadi, enjio, samalangikta jaise vishyon par baat kare to turant use wapamanthi maan lete hai
 These Article 370, Uniform Civil Code, Hinduism, talk of cow protection are considered modern only
 ''in sabaki vajah? vichaaron main khulaapan na hona
 Another BJP leader says, "the manner in which the excesses of the saffron brigade immediately declare the anti-national views as anti-national, the direction of the debate deviates
 '' vichaaron ke khulepan se sambandhit ek vakya amit shah se hi judaa he
 In a meeting with the mps of UP, MP Lallu Singh suggested to field the assembly candidate soon, then Shah almost scolded, "you name your region, declare now
" '' saansad chup ho gaye
 On the other hand, most of the autonomous institutions that the Sangh relies on to build intellectuals, are competing to focus credit on seminars with a view to making an impact in Satta
 sangh parivaar ko apane chintak taiyaar karne se pehle vamapanthiyon par hi shodh kii darkaar he
 Intellectuals like Bipin Chandra were academics from beginning to end
 par dakshinpanth, jise sangh rashtrawaad kahata he, main aisi sthiti nahin dikhti
 The Sangh and the BJP need to introspect on the fact that they have spread 'branches' a lot, but why can't they take roots in the intellectual world? supreme court ne aadesh diya he ki film shuru hone se pehle desh ke sabhi cinemagharon ko raashtragan bajaanaa hoga
 But a cinema hall in Haridwar did not do so
 sthaneey media ke mutabik bharat kii hockey khilaadi vandana kataaria haridwar main ek mal ke movie haul main parivaar ke saath film dekhne gayi thi

 jisase shraddhaluon kii sankhya main kaaphi kami ai he
 After knowing the condition of Kedarnath, Aaj Tak's team reached Badrinath Dham, where pilgrims from different states of the country are very upset due to heavy landslides for the last 3 days and are forced to spend their time on the road for three days
 ab ekmaatr paidal rasta bachaa he jangal or pahaado ke bich patali si pagadendi kaa jis par chalate hue kab pair phisal jaae kahana mushkil he
 When the team of 'aaj Tak' inspected the entire highway, it found that the entire road had sunk as soon as it came down from Joshimath and what was left is trying to pierce the iron bars by piercing with the machines
 taaki bachi hui sadak ko tuutane se bachaaya ja sake
 Significantly, the Badrinath Yatra which was running smoothly a few days ago, has also been stopped by the landslide, since last three days there has been a huge landslide from the hill in Lambadh of Badrinath Dham
 jisase pichley teen dinon se maarg band pad gaya he or dono ore shraddhalu fanse hue hai
 Passengers have to go through an alternate route
 yah maarg lamabgad kii pahadiyon ke upar se banaaya gaya he, jisko paar karne main lagbhag 4 ghante se adhik samay lag rahaa he
 Despite the climbing and slippery path, devotees are crossing these paths putting their lives at risk
 haalanki in sari museebaton par aasthaa baari padati dikhaai de rahi he or kai log pahari ke paidal raste se hi bhagwaan badrinaath ke darshan karne ja rahe hai
 Landslides in Lambgarh have been lined with vehicles on both sides of the road for the last three days
 lamabgad kii ye pahari pehle bhi kai baar darak chuki he par is samay baari barish kii vajah se pahari ke madhya se bhuskhalan zyada bad gaya
 Due to which devotees are facing difficulties in seeing Badri Vishal
 aise main yadi or barish hoti he to yah bhuskhalan or bhi vikaraal rup le saktaa he
 Scientists have developed smart glasses (glasses) whose lenses are liquid based and their flexibility will help to focus on everything that the person wearing the glasses is looking at
 uta uniwarsity ke shodhakartaaon dwaara viksit in glaces ko kuch is tarah viksit kiya gaya ki vah aankh kii prakritik putali kii tarah kaam karenge yani vah har us vastu par focus kar sakenge jise bhi vyakti dekh rahaa he chaahe vah vastu dur kii ho yaa phir paas kii
 With aging our lens lenses become tighter and lose their ability and flexibility to focus at different distances
 isliye chashma lagane kii jarurat padati he
 But it gets more difficult when we lose the ability to focus at different distances and in such a situation we need different lenses to see at different distances
 tippaniyan The newly developed glasses have a lens made of glycerin which is placed between two flexible membranes
 in lenson ko frem main laga diya jaataa he
 These membranes turn to add focus
 lens kaa lacheelaapan or mudane kii kshamta ke chalate ek hi lens bahulence kaa kaam kar saktaa he
 This research was published in the journal Optics Express
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) umr badhane ke saath hamaari ankhon ke lens kadak hote jate hai or vibhinn duuri par focus karne kii apni kshamta or lacheelaapan kho dete hai
 Therefore, glasses need to be installed
 lekin tab mushkil or bad jaati he jab ham vibhinn duuri par focus karne kii kshamta kho dete hai or aisi sthiti main hamen alag-alag duuri par dekhne ke liye vibhinn lainson kii jarurat padati he
 The comments nae viksit chashmon main glissrin se bane lens hote hai jinhen do lacheelee jhilliyon ke bich rakhaa jaataa he
 These lenses are mounted in the frame
 ye jhilliyaan focus milaane ke liye mud jaati hai
 The same lens can function as a multiplicity due to the flexibility and flexibility of the lens

 ) On the way to Lahli, it seemed as if we were going to a fair
 eenton ke makaan vaale gaanv se baahar rajmarg ke donon kinaaron par safede ke oonche-oonche ped lage the
 The railroad was visible at a short distance from the road
 lahali ke chamchamaate stadium ke chaaron taraf dur-dur tak ganne or dhan ke khet faile hue the
 The fair was held just for the darshan of one God ‚Äî a huge hoarding was placed outside the stadium which read, "the God of Cricket, Sachin Tendulkar" was welcome
 us bhagwaan kii ek jhalak paane ke liye alag-alag maarg the
 No tickets were kept for darshan
 darshanaathi stadium ke andar jane ke liye sarpanch, disi, espi, dspi yaa cricket ke kisi prashaasak ke paas ja sakate the, yaa phir malhotra ji se anurodh kar sakate the, jinhone stadium ke nirmaan ke liye apane khet beche the
 If anyone was deprived of the grace of these people, he could have left his name and phone number on a stall outside the stadium in the hope that the god above might be honored
 ham tirthayatriyon main kai tarah ke log the
 Some were supreme devotees, some people who came there to spend time, some were hooligans, some were connoisseurs, some were apprehensive pilgrims and some were atheists
 sachin ke darshan ke liye umadi bheed main lahali or rohtak ke yuva, bhivani ke pahalwaan, haryana kii ek mahila cricketer kii maa, chandigarh, kolkata or mumbai ke patrkaar, dilli se 300 nijee surakshakarmi, or kam-se-kam 1,400 pulicekarmi shaamil hai
 The biggest devotee among us was 33 years old
 use sachin kii ek-ek paariyaan jubaani yaad thim
 You ask him about any test, he will tell you in a second where the test was played, against whom it was played and how many runs his god scored
 ajit singh tanvar ek dihadi mistre tha
 He came from Dabla village in Sikar district in Rajasthan
 vah apane saath ek patr laayaa tha, jisamen usne apane bare main sachin ko jaankaree di thi
 It also contained a poem praising Sachin
 vah yah patr sachin ko dena chahta tha
 i thought i would go to Lahli, not Mumbai, because the atmosphere like a grand wedding in Mumbai, the crowds of politicians and celebrities, the drama of ticket quota, the special kind of reception of the guest team, etc
 would become very cumbersome
 sachin par aakhri baar report likhnaa mere liye bilkul usee tarah kaa anubhav tha, jis tarah pehali baar report likhe jane kaa anubhav
 i am thinking of practicing days on the net in the morning at the Middle Income Group Club in Bandra (east) 12 years ago
 main vahaan isliye gaya tha taaki yah dekh sakuun ki yah jeniyas net par kaise kheltaa he
 Does Genius like to practice in solitude? "niche (what has he come)?" Members of the club asked the guards standing there softly
 or ve phir pool yaa gym main jane ko taalane lage taaki baraamde se jate hue use dekh saken
 Tendulkar batted for an hour against five bowlers, practiced his cover drive behind the net for 20 minutes, and the sound of his strokes gave a pleasant feeling to the ears in the morning
 bich-bich main ve apane saathi atul ranade or apane bhai ajit se salaah le lete the
 Those who were standing at the gate looking at them included photographers, autographers and children
 ham logon ke bich ek chota ladkaa bhi shaamil tha, jo apni chamakdaar ankhon se badi utsukata se sachin ko nihaar rahaa tha
 i asked the boy's guardian, "does he play cricket?" He smilingly replied, "that's the only thing he loves
" 
 
 darasal vah latur se he
 He has come to Mumbai for a brain tumor operation
 vah paas ke hi ek aspataal main rukaa hua he or puraa din cricket dekhtaa he
 Someone told him that Sachin comes here for practice, so brought me here to see Sachin
 ‚Äùkhel patrkaar or unke sampadak kai baar pakshpaati ho jate hai
 When CLR James wrote that "the spectators of Test matches in the West Indies also bring with them a past and future expectations", he kind of gave direction to an entire generation of writers
 duusare khel lekhak iske shilp ko mahatv dete hai or duniya se alag apni raay pesh karte hai
 Luckily, we see Sachin's batting in his true form
 vaaki sachin ko ham master blaster sachin ke rup main hi dekhte hai
 In his last home match, Sachin takes his bat to the ground when 12 wickets have fallen in the first four hours
 ve baari shor or taaliyon kii gadgadahat ke bich aage badhate hai
 Photographers do dhingamut each other to take their photo
 sachin ke liye yah vaahvahee kabhi feeki nahin padi or na hi kabhi feeki padegi
 Yes, a Haryanvi is probably not much impressed by him, who comments on seeing them, it looks like two and a half feet
 ‚Äù uske liye sachin kaa kad bhi myne rakhata he
 But even though Sachin's height is small, his size is huge
 pich shandaar he
 We were told that the water level in Lahli is so high that the grass of the pitch never ends, it becomes even more green after every match
 kheton main asthaayee rup se banaai gai parking main khadi kaaren jameen main dhans jaati hai
 There is greenery in the ground
 tej gendbaajon kii chaandi he
 TV people have had to make a cement platform for themselves so that they do not fall on the head of Sachin from a height of 40 feet
 sachin apana janaa-pahachaanaa stroke lagaate hai or gend maidan par bhaagti seemaa rekha ke paar chali jaati he
 They are out after some time
 gend unke balle ko chooti hui viketon ko bikher detii he
 They have been bowling out for a similar ball for the last two years
 unke out hone ke bees minute ke bheetar chhole-kulche or ganne kaa ras bechney vaale kheton se gaayab ho jate hai
 The crowd of 6,000 people is trimmed
 or sirf ranjai trophy match kaa saaya hi vahaan rah jaataa he
 This shows what Tendulkar is and what he means in cricket
 ve pavilian main aa gaye hai or har koi yahi soch rahaa he ki aakhir ve kya soch rahe hai
 i once heard him say to my partner, "if my batting day is good, then my day is also good
 ‚Äù lekin vastav main achche yaa kharaab din kaa sawaal hi nahin he
 Every day is Sachin's day in Sachin's life
 khel ke baad ve dilli se bheji gai safed rang kii 5 siries kii ek bmadblu car main baithkar lautate hai
 According to an agreement, they cannot travel in any other brand of car on public occasions
 kuch ladke apni bike par savaar hokar unki car ke saath sarapat daudte hai or car kii khidki se unki tasviren khinchate hai
 Sachin is afraid that no road accident should happen, so he asks his driver to drive slowly
 ve akasar logon ke junun ko lekar kaaphi saavdhaanee baratate hai
 An already huge crowd awaits them at the canal rest house gate
 yahaan unhen mumbai ke chaar ‚Äòsenior‚Äô khiladinnon ke saath tehraaya gaya he
 Some influential people are inside, breaking the security cordon
 in logon kii sankhya kareeb 100 he
 They want to join hands with Sachin, take a photo of him, take an autograph of him, introduce him to their children and some want to see him very closely
 sachin sabaki ichha puri karte hai
 The documentary makers of his farewell tour told me this
 ve chaahate the ki sachin unhen paryaapt samay den
 It is Sachin who has approved him to make a film
 dilli ke itisi maurya se chah logon kii team ai he, jo rest house main unke liye khaanaa taiyaar karti haih unke khaane main food poijaning jaisi koi baat ho gai to kya nateeja hoga, andaaj lagaaya ja saktaa he
 They drink sweet lassi once in the morning and evening
 press ke logon ko unke khan-paan kii aadaton ko lekar kaaphi dilchaspee rahati he
 Sachin loves Rohtak's sweet lassi
 duusare din shaam ko jin logon ko sachin se milane kaa mauka miltaa he, unamem ajit singh tanvar bhi hai
 He gives one of his letters to Sachin
 badale main unhen sachin ke dastakhat vaali baniyaan mili or saath main dher sara pyaar bhi
 When Sachin asked him about test numbers 130, 80 and 155 for his exam, Ajit gave the right answer without delay (130 runs were unbeaten against England in the 130th Test and it played after 26 / 11 i went
 )
 i asked Ajit Singh, "isn't Dravid equal to Sachin?" This was enough to provoke them
 yah baat maine iff cricket ij a relijan, sachin ij god naam kii kitaab se sikhi thi
 He replied tadac, "not even Bradman can compete with Sachin
 west indies ke khilaaf breadman kaa ausat dekhoh 74
 5
 ‚Äù‚Äúsachin kaa itnaa ausat kisi ke khilaaf nahin
 "this Sachin devotee of Sikar silenced me," Sachin averaged 136 against Bangladesh
 66 he
 "soon there is a war between TV journalists over Ajit
 ek channel ne unhen 50,000 ru
 Has contracted on
 yahi he sachin kaa karishma
 Cricket is a game of complete uncertainties, no one knows when it will happen
 kuch bhi tay nahin he
 Bradman was dismissed for zero at the Oval ground in his farewell Test match
 paanch maheene baad pratham shrenee ke ek match main emsiji main unhen vidaai dene ke liye 94,000 logon kii bheed juty thi, sirf shanivaar ko hi 52,000 darshak unhen ek or shatak lagaate dekhnaa chaahate the
 After this, for a few months he continued to play for the gathering of friends
 edilade main ek match ke dauraan toss fiks tha taaki breadman shanivaar ko maidan main aa saken
 This was revealed after a long time
 lekin khel kii sthiti badalane se unhen shuukravaar kii shaam ko hi maidan par aana padaa or agle din shanivaar ko ve jaldi hi 30 ran par out ho gaye
 He sprained his ankle and left the field
 yah breadman kaa pratham shrenee kaa aakhri match tha
 Sunil Gavaskar scored 96 runs on a crumbling pitch in his last innings against Pakistan
 phir bhi bharat haar gaya tha
 In his last match of the first class, he scored 188 against Rest of the World against MCC at Lord's
 duusari pari main mailkam marshall kii gend par ve shunya par out ho gaye the
 In 1987, he played his last international innings against England in the World Cup semi-finals
 ve sirf 4 ran banaakar out ho gaye the or bharat ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa tha
 Vivian Richders, like Bradman, had scored 60 runs playing the last Test at the Oval, but could not win the series against West Indies England for the first time in 17 years
 do sijan ke baad unhone cantarbari main glamorgan ke liye apana aakhri match khelaa tha
 This match was for the Sunday League title
 vahaan yuva gendbaaj kent ne unhen bahut pareshaan kiya
 a fast ball came to his chest, they could not hook it and the ball was caught
 lekin vah no-ball thi
 He won Glamorgan with his contribution
 lahali main saste main out hone ke baavjood sachin post nahin hai
 In no way are they different from richards
 ve apane sharir ke nichle hisse main vajan badaae se jujh rahe hai or ab bhi usase nibatane main lage hai
 They adjust their legs twice while playing
 pehle to krij ke kone par or doosraa stans lene se pehle
 They are also shaking their heads so much that their helmet is afraid of falling
 viketon ke bich bhaagane main bhi ve mauka padane par pehle jaisi teji dikhaate hai
 If they see that Fielder can pose a threat, they run away like some leopards and some like Ranatunga
 unki body language main kisi tarah kaa halkaapan nahin aayaa he
 There is no visible negligence in applying stroke, which is very important indeed
 haa ek mauka aisa jarur he jab ve khud ko thodaa dhilaa chhod dete hai, or vah he dhimi bounsar
 On this, they surely miss out and run their bat before time
 apper-cat lagane main ve deree kar jate hai or gend nikal jaati he
 They look a bit embarrassed
 kisi spinner ko front foot par khilne main ve hichkichaate hai
 Avoid hitting the ball on high rise balls
 pich ke liye yah ek acchhee ranneeti he
 Tendulkar also knows that there has been a slight decrease in his speed, as his watchers have long suspected
 phir bhi ve kaayam hai, puure damakham ke saath apni jagah par bane hue hai
 Mumbai coach Sulakshan Kulkarni says that the rest of the players fall loose in the game after the announcement of retirement but Sachin did not do so
 sulakshan sachin ke saath unke pehle ranjai match main khel chuke hai
 Sachin kept coming to practice on the net with the same passion as he had for the first time
 ve pehle kii hi tarah paanch baar net practice karte hai
 He told his teammates in Mumbai, ‚Äúbe honest with cricket
 ‚Äù aachrekar sar ne unhen yahi sabak sikhaaya tha, jise unhone hameshaa yaad rakhaa
 Sachin is still at the crease
 ve apana dharm nibhaane ke bhav main ballebaaji karte hai
 They are playing all kinds of shots, sometimes they glance and sometimes they take another shot
 is tarah ve ek badhibia match main jeet dilaate hai

 chunki khaanaa aane main deree hui thi isliye priyanka or uske do kajan ghar se baahar khaane kaa intjaar karte najar aate hai

 Lalit Sim had reached to recharge
 ye lalit kii aakhri tasviir he
 To thank that Lalit's going to recharge the sim for about 12 hours before the suicide incident raises suspicion that by then there was probably no plan to swing from the noose
 yaa shaayad ye bhi ho saktaa he ki unki maansik dasha aisi ho chuki thi ki unhen fande se jhulakar bhi batch nikalne kaa bharosa tha, kyonki lalit ise khudakushi nahin balki dharmik karmkand kii prakriya bataa rahaa tha
 It is said that the entire family did so to express their gratitude to God at Lalit's behest at the behest of father's soul as they felt that the work done at Lalit's behest led to a lot of happiness for the family

 sabhi unke bare main jaanate hai ki ve (giriraaj) kis prishthbhumi se aae hai
 The RJD supremo said that Giriraj should be wearing a bangle, vermilion, dot, and soot on his face, because he has crossed the modesty of profanity

 ab jaisaa jaisaa china kahata jaataa he vaisaa vaisaa pakistan karata jaataa he
 But this is China
 jo chuun bhi karata he to uske peeche bhi uskaa koi naa koi makasad zarur chipa hota he
 Now-a-days, the People's Liberation Army is giving tips to Pakistan to strengthen its border area
 saath hi iske liye wo pakistan ke sainikon ko training bhi muhaiyyaa kara rahaa he
 The aim is to give tension to India
 magar bharat isse bilkul bhi pareshaan nahin he
 However, for this one purpose, two enemies of India are definitely benefiting
 or donon ek ho gaye hai
 At the same time, China is also trying to strengthen Islamabad against India
 intelligence sutron ke mutabik china pakistan ke sainikon ko training dekar international border par majboot karne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Not only this, a team of 15 to 20 soldiers of the People's Liberation Army visited 14 Infantry Division headquarters in Okara, Pakistan
 saath hi piele ke sainik basirpur or sulemanaki ke bich forward aria bhi gaye
 According to reports, this training has been given by PLA to 23 Sindh / 21 Sindh Brigade people of Pakistan
 jis aria main piele kaa daura hua or training di gai, wo bharat ke fajilka ke behad kareeb he
 As part of its plan to strengthen the border area, the Pakistani Army is also building large bridges to strengthen its position on the international border so that the Indian Army can be monitored from a high place
 sutron ke mutabik pakistan kii ranneeti main ye badlaav china kii piples librasion army ke pratinidhimandal ke daure ke baad aayaa he
 At the same time, military relations between China and Pakistan are deepening
 china-pakistan ko har mumkin madad detaa rahaa he
 The military partnership of China and Pakistan is also increasing continuously, about which the Indian Army is alert
 china na sirf pakistan ko antarrashtriya par majboot karne kii koshish kar rahaa he balki bhartiya nausena se mukaable ke liye bhi taiyaar kar rahaa he
 Pakistan is also purchasing 8 Attack Submarines from China, whose first delivery is said to be in 2023
 china-pakistan economic coridor ko banane main china kii sena bhi shaamil he
 India has expressed its concerns about CPEC many times
 kuch din pehle america media main aisi khabaren thim ki china, pakistan main fiter jet or duusare military hardware banane ke sikret plan kar kaam kar rahaa he
 After which it was clarified by Pakistan that CPEC is an economic project and there is no military dimension
 jab se america ne pakistan ko aarthik madad dena band kiya he tab se hi pakistan chatapata rahaa he
 His economy is lagging
 lihaaza use china main hi apana madadgaar nazar aa rahaa he
 But Pakistan is unable to understand China's move in the matter of help
 or pakistan dhire dhire china ko chhodkar apane saare darvaaze band kar rahaa he
 And to depend so much on someone is the greatest reward of slavery
 isamen shaq nahin he ki china pakistan ke bure vakt main uske saath khadaa he magar iske badale main pakistan ko china ke saamne apana zamir bhi girvee rakhana pad rahaa he
 China is charging a heavy price in return for strengthening Pakistan militarily and economically

 miss americania sanshes pratispardhaa kii pehali upavijeta or ukraine kii sundari diana harkusha duusari upavijeta raheen
 Paulina has captured the crown of Miss Universe, leaving behind the beauties of 87 countries
 miss univers 2013, venezuela kii gabriela isler ne florida ke miami main yojit is beauty pejaint main polina ko taj pahanaaya
 The highlight of the Miss Universe competition this year was that this time the crown of Miss Universe was new, prepared by Diamond International Corporation (DIC)
 is pratiyogita main miss univers deeva rah chukiyonita lodhbhi bharat ko riprogent kar raheen thi
 Input: IANS yogi adityanath kii tajposhi se soobe ke 20 fisadi alpsankhyakon ke maathe par chintaa kii lakeer hai
 The question is blazing in everyone's mind, on what agenda will Yogis with a strong Hindutva image
 lakhanu ke chowk ilaake ke akabari get par hamane chaoupal kiya he
 In Chaupal we have talked to all Muslim men and women
 unase poocha he ki muslim yogi kii tajposhi ko kis tarah se dekhte hai? ghar vaapasi se lekar lav jihad jaise muddon par apane tikhe bhaashanon ke liye mashhoor yogi ko siem banane par musalamaanon kii salaah kya he? lakhanu se hamaari ground report
 
 
 
 puraane lakhanu ke chowk ilaake kii tang galiyon main rosemara kii tarah jindagi patari par chal rahi he
 In this area of akbari Gate of Chowk is halla-gulla
 karigar udhed ban main lage hai
 Bangles are shining and gotas have a glow
 tunde kebab kii khushboo dur se logon ko dukaan kii ore khinchakar laa rahi he
 The gathering of people in the market, political silence in all the noise and the mood of Muslims in this silence
 is bich hamane chowk ilaake ke logon ke mood ko bhaanpane kii koshish kii
 Difference between Yogi and as CM Yogi People of this area feel that there is a difference between a Yogi and a CM Yogi
 sarkarein ain or gayi, wo jahaan the vahiin hai
 While the election results of Uttar Pradesh brought an overwhelming majority for the BJP, the discussion was in full swing that this was the result of the displeasure of Hindus and votes against Muslims
 jahaan bhaajapa ne musalmaan ko ek bhi tikat nahin diya, vahiin duusari taraf basapa or sapa musalamaanon ke maan manavvar main lage rahe
 In such a situation, where there is a backlash among the Muslims regarding the results of the election, a section believes that if there is a history of BJP government in the state, then there is no need to fear the Muslims
 muslim netaaon kaa badhata abhaavuttar pradesh vidhansabha par najar daudaayen, to 2012 se 2017 main muslim vidhayak kii sankhya 17
 Falling 1 percent to 5
 9 pratishat pahunch gai he
 In fact, the lack of Muslim leaders in the political battle of UP is increasing
 aise musalamaanon ke paas bhaajapa kii ore ummid kii takataki lagaae rahane ke alaava or koi chaara nahin he
 Apart from this, some Muslims say that the mandate that came in the election, the kind of poison that was spewed, the way it tried to create a rift in forced, was not a good way
 boojadkhaanon kii baat ho rahi he
 Speaking of cemeteries
 karbala kii baat ho rahi he
 We would like to say that Kiyogi Adityanath Sahab should first do a little study about these
 musalamaanon ne diya bijepi ko votemusalamaanon kaa kahana he ki jahaan tak atal bihari vaajapeyi sahab kii shakhsiyat kaa taalluk he, unka muqabla kiya hi nahin ja saktaa he
 If they were called Lucknow instead of Gwalior, it would be better
 yahaan kii samskruti or rahan-sahan ke liye vah bemisaal the
 Muslims have also voted for Atal ji
 dekhie yogi adityanath ke liye ham kahenge ki insaan acha-bura nahin hota he, jo unki body language he, jo kattarta he, usase lagata he ki yahi sahi he
 But we have heard that he belongs to Gorakhnath and the shops in his area in Gorakhpur are Muslim
 hamaara kahana yah he ki aap kisi ko darane kii jarurat nahin
 Now they will have to follow the path of 'sabka Saath Sabka Vikas'
 muslimon ne bhi bijepi ko vot diya he

 He was born on 19 May 1913

 He worked in this post for about 10 years
 5
 He became the first Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh in October 1956
 phir 1959 se 1962 tak bhartiya rashtriya congress ke adhyaksh ke rup main se kaary kiya

 10
 bharat ke sabase yuva raashtrapati ne 1 june 1996 ko duniya ko alavida kah diya
 The cause of his death was pneumonia
 himachal vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ne ain vakt par prem kumaar dhumal ko siem candidet ghoshit kar diya he
 This announcement of the BJP has shocked the supporters of party veteran and JP Nadda, a minister in the Modi government
 pichley kuch saal se nadda par jis tarah piem modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne bharosa jataayaa he use dekhte hue is diggaj ko himachal chunaav main siem pad kaa swaabhaavik daavedaar mana ja rahaa tha
 However, if you look at the caste equations of the state, there is nothing surprising in the bjp's announcement about Dhumal
 nadda kii tulana main dhumal jatigat samikarnon ke lihaaj se kahin zyada majboot pratyaashee najar aate hai
 Rajput King Maker in Himachal Rajput community is the most important in the politics of Himachal Pradesh
 rajya main sabase zyada kareeb 37 fisadi rajput matadaata hai
 18 percent of Brahmins come after this
 prem kumaar dhumal rajput samudaay se aate hai to vahiin jepi nadda brahman hai
 In this way, Dhumal's vote bank is more than double that of Nadda
 aise main brahman par daanv khelkar bijepi rajputon ko naaraaz nahin karnaa chaahati thi
 Anyway, the face of the Chief Minister from the Congress is Virbhadra Singh, who is from the Rajput community itself
 aise main rajput matadaata congress ke kheme main jane kii ashanka thi jiske chalate bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne aanan-fanan main voting ke mahaj 10 din pehle rajput netaa prem kumaar dhumal ko siem candidet bana diya
 JP Nadda camp has received the biggest shock due to the announcement of Nadadhumal's name
 bijepi alaakaman jis tarah se pichley do saal se nadda ko rajya main project kar rahaa tha or unhen jimmedaariyaan de rahaa tha, use dekhte hue nadda samarthak apane netaa ko siem pad kaa swaabhaavik ummidavaar maan rahe the
 JP Nadda was given the responsibility of rallies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah in Himachal
 lekin chunavi paara jab apane puure ufaan par pahunchaa to dhumal par daanv khel diya gaya
 Himachal's political equation is a total of 68 assembly seats in Himachal Pradesh
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main rajya kii 68 siton main se congress ko 36, bijepi ko 26 to anya ko 6 siten mili thim
 The Congress had gained 13 seats in the 2012 assembly elections compared to 2007, while the BJP had lost 16 seats in 2012 compared to 2007
 2012 vidhansabha chunaav main mili voton par najar daalen to congress ko 43 fisadi or bijepi ko 39 fisadi vot mili the
 Compared to 2007, the Congress vote increased by 5 per cent while the BJP lost 5 per cent of the vote
 bijepi mahaj 4 fisadi voton se congress se peeche rahi lekin congress kii tulana main use 10 siten kam milin
 The petition filed by the petitioner and BJP leader Ashwani Upadhyay in the Supreme Court has said that there is a provision under Section 33 (7) of the Representation of People Act (representation of People Act) that a candidate can contest from two seats
 vahiin dhara-70 kahata he ki do siton se chunaav ladane ke baad agar candidet donon siten jeet letaa he to use ek seat par istipha dena hota he kyonki vah ek hi seat apane paas rakh saktaa he yachikakarta ne kaha ki har naagarik kaa moulik adhikaar he ki vah candidet kaa record dekhe or uske yogyata ko dekhe or voting kare
 If the candidate wins from two places, he has to leave one seat and re-election to that seat
 dobaaraa upachunaav hone se sarkaar par aarthik boj padataa he
 More than 90 musclemen from Uttar Pradesh were shifted to prisons far from their home districts
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kii sarkaar ke sthaneey aparaadh network ko dhwast karne ke prayaas ke tahat yah kadam uthaaya gaya he
 Bahubalis transferred include Mukhtar Ansari, Munna Bajrangi, Atik Ahmed, Shekhar Tiwari, Maulana Anwarul Haque, Mukim alias Kala, Udaybhan Singh alias Doctor, Titu alias Kiranpal, Raki alias Kaki and Alam Singh
 apper police mahanideshak (jail) jiel meena ne bataaya ki don salaakhon ke peeche hai
 However, his gang members easily commit murder, kidnapping, robbery and extortion
 90 se adhik kaidiyon ko ek jail se duusari jail sthanantarit kiya gaya he
 Those who are admitted to mental hospitals in Agra, Varanasi and Bareilly
 unhen chinhit kiya ja rahaa he
 The jail administration has sent a letter to mental hospitals, directing them to send health reports of the prisoners under consideration
 aspataal se jail jaaenge upi ke donunhone bataaya ki vibhinn maansik aspataalon main daakhil 18 jail ant:vaasiyon kii pahchaan kii ja chuki he
 The process of giving warrant of arrest against him has been initiated
 un aspataalon ke chikitsa adhikariyon se report maangi gai he, jahaan vichaaradhin kaidi bhartee hai
 Most are notorious criminals
 pakade jane ke dar se ab doctoron ne aise vichaaradhin kaidiyon ko aspataal se chuttee dena shuru kar diya he
 Doctors have been given strict instructions to do so
 dhamkaane ke liye jail se karte the phongel prashasan ko soochna mili he ki giroh ke sadsy jail main milane aate hai or vahiin se aapraadhik vaardaat kii yojana banati he
 Mobile phones and SIM cards have been recovered from the criminals' barracks during surprise raids
 vyavsaayee, thekedaar or sarkari adhikariyon tathaa baat nahin maanane waalon ko jail se kisi bahubali kaa phone hi dhamkaane ke liye kaaphi hota he
 The reason for the transfer of the inmates from one prison to another is to break their network

 ‚Äôbijepi pravaktaa sambit paatra ne AAP par kaamkaaj kaa taanaashaahee andaaj apnaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 Patra said, the Aam Aadmi Party is facing an explosion from inside
 yaad rakhie, bharat jaise mahaan desh vaale loktantr main ek aadmi kii party nahin ho sakati
 And this is where the Aam Aadmi Party has reduced itself
 AAP netaa adarsh shastri ne kaha ki unki party kii sarkaar ne buniyadi muddon par apana focus kar rakhaa he
 Shastri said, popularity means that you should form a government and do good consistently while in power

 The third option has devastated itself
 ‚Äôsambit paatra ne survey ke is nishkarsh se asahmati jataai ki punjab main rahul gandhi kii lokapriyata pradhanmantri modi se adhik he

 ek baar phir is baat kaa khulaasa hua he ki most wonted anderworld don daud ibrahim kaa network bharat ke kone kone main failaa hua he
 Dawood's henchmen proved this by getting a fake passport from Rajasthan
 mumbai police ke hathe chadhe don ke kareebi builder riyaj bhaati ke paas se yah passport mila
 Dawood's close friend came to Mumbai Police a few days ago, Mumbai Police got the news that Riyaz Bhati, a close builder of Underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, is in the process of going out of the country
 police use tabhi se talash kar rahi thi
 Late Wednesday, officials posted at Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport received a secret notification that Riyaz was going abroad today
 police or imigration ke adhikari alert the
 At that time, a passenger was taken into custody by the police at night
 jisaki pahchaan riyaj bhaati ke rup main hui
 Two passports have been stolen from Riyazbhati caught from Jaipur
 inamen se ek passport G3128659 jaipur se 2007 main jari hua tha, jo phulji bhaati ke naam se tha
 He was going to travel by the name of Phoolji Bhati
 jab vah mumbai ke chhatrapati shivaji antarrashtriya hawaii adde par pahunchaa to usne yatra ke liye imigration adhikari ke samaksh phulji bhaati ke naam se passport prastut kiya tha
 But during the questioning, his reality came to light
 luk out notice se pakadaa gaya riyajadaud ibrahim ke is khaas gurgey ko police neluk out notice kii badoltapakadaa
 Actually, a few months ago, Mumbai police issued a look out notice of Riyaz
 buudhvaar kii der raat jab vah orport pahunchaa to imigration checking ke dauraan vah pakadaa gaya
 Authorities took Riyaz into custody as soon as he was identified
 koun he riyaj bhaatidikhane ke liye to riyaj ek builder he
 But in reality he works for underworld don Dawood Ibrahim in India
 vah yahaan di company kaa hawala karobaar sambhalata he
 It is counted among the big builders of Mumbai
 magar uskaa naam khandala firing cese main bhi saamne aayaa tha
 Apart from this, he has several criminal cases including land grab
 police ke mutabik vah gangster ikbaal ataravaala or ajay ke saath daaud kii ek party main bhi shaamil hua tha
 With his loyalty and clout, he remained special to d Company
 chaukanna hui suraksha agenciyandi company ke jaipur conection kaa khulaasa hone ke baad rajasthan kii police or suraksha agenciyon ke hosh ud gaye hai
 After the arrest of Riyaz Bhati, as soon as the passport bearing his fake name was discovered, the agencies of Rajasthan were informed
 yah khabar milte hi adhikariyon kii peshaani par bal pad gaye
 It is now being investigated how Riyaz Bhati was issued a passport in the name of Phoolji Bhati from Jaipur
 or is kaam main kisne uski madad kii
 On remand, Riyaz Mumbai Police questioned Riyaz Bhati after arresting him
 or guuruuvaar ko use court main pesh kiya gaya
 Police sought Riyaz Bhati's remand from the court
 jise maanate hue adaalat ne riyaj ko do navambar tak police remand main bhej diya
 Police hope that during interrogation of Riyaz Bhati important information can be found

 On 12 June in Surat, three boys in turn raped a class 12 girl on the back seat of a moving car and imprisoned them in a mobile phone
 iske do din hi baad bharat is khabar ke saath jaagaa ki abhinayta shaini ahuja ne apni umr or kad-lathi main aadhi 18 varshiya naukaraani ke saath balaatkaar kiya
 a 19-year-old college student was gang-raped on 19 June, before the student's boyfriend and his friends prepared an MMS of sexual relations with the girl and distributed the MMS clip
 videshiyon kii bhi kadra nahinusi din ek british swayamsevi sanstha kii kaaryakarta ko himachal pradesh ke palampur main do taxi driveron ne buree tarah apamaanit kiya
 And on 22 June, a woman in Indrapuri area of delhi's rape capital, Delhi, alleged that six policemen raped her in the police station that afternoon
 yani taarikh badalati rahati he, aparaadh vahi rahata he
 Causes of abhorrent sexual violence? What is the reason that an actor rising up the ladder of success and some youth aroused by lust descends on abhorrent sexual violence? Is it just lust because of work? Or is it an expression of anger against women? Who the hell are these male vampires? An in-depth study conducted by Delhi-based NGO Swanchetan on 242 prisoners of Tihar Jail in five years makes a conclusion in the mind of the rapist that anyone can be a rapist
 isse bhi adhik chintaa kii baat-rashtriya aparaadh record beuro (enciarabi) ke mutabik-yah he ki 92 fisadi maamalon main balaatkaar karne vaala peedit mahila kaa parichit ho saktaa he, jis par vah bharosa karti he
 The rapists that Swanchettan studied had committed multiple rapes before being caught, four on average
 in sabhi ke man main mahilaon ke prati gahari nafrat thi
 They habitually used abusive and vulgar abuses towards them
 apane shikaar par yon fantasiyaan aajamaane kii kabhi na mitane vaali bhukh bhi unamem pai gai
 They also used to go to new places in search of hunting for more enjoyment and adventure
 so, hairat kii baat nahin ki 70 fisadi se adhik main manorogiyon vaale lakshan paae gaye
 This denies that rape is a perverse crime committed by healthy minds
 swanchetan dwaara kiye gaye adhyayan main paaya gaya ki 68 fisadi aparaadhiyon kaa bachapan asaamaanya rahaa tha, jise dilli ke manochikitsak jitendra nagpal ''bal yon shoshan kaa vistaar'' kehete hai
 Typically the only involved are the acquaintances of the victim
 unka bhi aise hi yon shoshan kaa itihaas hota he
 Take the case of Umesh Reddy, a former constable of the Reserve Police, who was convicted in more than 20 crimes of raping and killing women
 11 saal chale mukademe ke baad farvari main hycourt ne use faansee kii sajaa sunai
 The cases in Surat and Mumbai show that such criminals feel more powerful when they are in gangs
 samuhik balaatkaaron main ek netaa hota he, jo shuruyaat karata he
 He incites everyone present there to be involved in that crime so that no one can report the case
 unke chele hote hai jinhen ye shaamil hone ko kehete hai
 The same thing happened in 2005 when a 16-year-old girl was raped by six men in a bus parked at a depot in Najafgarh area of delhi
 yahaan do balaatkaariyon ne pahal kii, ladki ko berahami se peetate hue uske saath balaatkaar kiya, or unamem se ek ne jab dusron ko rokane kii koshish kii to use bhi ladki se dushkarm karne ko majaboor kiya
 Search for spontaneous hunting "" Most rapists prefer a profession where they find spontaneous prey
 masalan, adhyaapan, doctorl, anathalayon main prashasan, yahaan tak ki aadhyatmik guru bananaa bhi
 Take a 2003 story in Delhi, where a 54-year-old doctor, a father of two daughters, was arrested for raping a 13-year-old teenager
 ladki vasant vihaar main doctor ke nijee nursing home main tibi ke ilaaj ke liye ai thi or kamare ke baahar uske saath ai uski ek rishtedaar bhi maujuud thi
 In 2007, a 44-year-old married private tutor in East Delhi raped a 17-year-old girl before forcing her to have sex, luring her to concentration in studies
 isi saal farvari main uttar pradesh ke faijabad main 15 varshiya ladki ke adhyaaapak ajit kumaar singh ne ladki ko do din tak kaid karke rakhaa or usase balaatkaar kiya
 Harish Shetty, a psychiatrist in Mumbai, says that no one is safe, "whoever is powerful in this global world will target the weak
" ''khatre main mahilaon kii surakshato isamen aashcharya kya ki aise teevr saamaajik badlaav ke maahaul main bharat america or dakshin africa ke baad mahilaon ke liye sarvaadhik asurakshit desh ban gaya he
 This is what the Ministry of Home Affairs released in 2008, while according to Nagpal, only a quarter of sexual abuse cases are reported
 yah bhi hairaani kii baat nahin he ki balaatkaar bharat ke teji se badhate aparaadhon main ek he
 When the NCRB started keeping records of such cases in 1971, there were an average of seven rapes per day
 ab yah aankada 57 par ja pahunchaa he or is tarah isamen 800 pratishat vruddhi ho gai he
 Conversely, in 1953 ‚Äî when the NCRB started keeping records in other crimes ‚Äî there has been a 300 percent increase
 sampradayik balaatkaar bhi mumkinbharat main balaatkaar sampradayik bhi ho saktaa he, jaisaaki surat ke samuhik balaatkaar maamle main saamne aayaa, jahaan apradhi yuva muslim ladke the jin par city aspataal main uttejit bheed ne hamalaa kiya, unhen yahaan police medical chekup ke liye laai thi
 Rape also takes political form as it did in Jammu and Kashmir, where 22-year-old Neelofar Jaan and his 17-year-old sister-in-law were taken out of the drain
 yah hameshaa hi amanviya hota he, or beraham tareeke se yojanabaddh bhi, jahaan takat kii jagah manovaigyanik yaa bhaavnaatmak dabaav se aparaadh ko anjaam diya jaataa he
 This kind of pressure from the relationship of trust also becomes easier when there is already a relationship of trust and trust
 2007 main gajiabad main aisa hi hua, jab 17 varshiya ladki ke rishte ke 21 varshiya bhai ne ladki se balaatkaar karne se pehle bhaavnaatmak rup se dabaav daalane ke liye kai tikadamen apanaain-use homework karne main madad se lekar kishoravay ke muddon par vichaar-vimarsh tak
 Or as the case in Mumbai now known as Mira Road Rape in which accused Parag Mhatre allegedly lured the victim for seven months, even promising to marry her
 mumbai ke atirikt police ayukta (aparaadh shakha) deven bharti kehete hai, ''balaatkaar kabhikbhaar hi aavesh main kiya gaya aparaadh hota he
 The rapist takes advantage of the situation and believes that the victimized woman cannot physically or mentally overpower him
 ''forencik mental health associats ke nideshak, america manovaigyanik nicholas groth apni practice ke 25 saalon main 3,000 se adhik yon aparaadhiyon kii jaanch kar chuke hai
 They have identified rape in three ways - rape in anger, demonstrating strength, and exploitation
 swanchetan kaa adhyayan bhi iske kaaphi kareeb he, jisamen is aparaadh kii teen shreniyan banaai gai hai-hinsak, parapidak or jaanaleva
 According to its classification, 45 per cent of rape cases are highly violent, with severe injuries to the victim and mutilating the body
 15 fisadi maamalon main balaatkaari parapidak harkaton par utaaru ho jaataa he, jinamein peedit kaa bachaav ke liye sangharsh use or uksaata he
 Danger of murder due to fear of case "" In 5 per cent of cases the victim is killed for fear of registering a crime
 2007 main najafagarh main hue balaatkaar ke maamle main aisa hi hua jisamen ek nirmaan sthal par balaatkaar karte hue apradhi ne apane haath se ladki kii aankh dhak di thi
 He told, 'I could see a plea in his eyes not to kill him
 yah mujhe pareshaan kar rahi thi
 In every case, the provoking element is a display of strength, not sexuality
 mahila adhikaron kii vakil flavia agnes kahati hai, ''yah samaj paanaa mushkil he ki aurat ko 
 How sex is used as a weapon to inflame and express hatred
 ''aparaadh ko mila takanic kaa saharmparaadh ko ab aadhunik takanic kaa sahaara mil gaya he, jo aparaadh pravriti ko santusht karne kaa vaada karti he
 The use of mobile phones to produce rape films and the digital format to distribute them has created a thriving pornography industry, accessible through DVD libraries and Internet cafes
 asal main aapraadhik pravriti ke beej bachapan main hi pad jate hai, jab bachche bade parade par khoonkhrabe vaali filmein dekhakar yaa video game ke jariye dusron ke prati hinsa ke pradarshan ko aatmsaat karne lagate hai
 Nagpal says, "on-screen violence makes children insensitive to the suffering of others
 '' yah balaatkaari banane kaa pehla padaav ban jaataa he, jo apane peedit ko shaareerik pidaa pahunchaakar sukh kaa anubhav karata he
 The impact of porn movies also: Prashant Bheemani, a renowned psychologist from Ahmedabad, confirms that nowadays 13-year-old children watch porn movies on the Internet, whereas 10 years ago it was limited to married couples or college students
 bhimaani kehete hai, ''ek ore to kendriya film pramann board ko bade parade par jarurat se zyada sex pesh karne par roak lagaani chahie, duusari ore mata-pita ko bacchon par kadi najar rakhane kii jarurat he ki ve ghar main kya dekhte hai
 "data to this effect is available with neo-protectionist groups in America
" neshnal colision on televijan vaayalence ke mutabik, hollywood kii aath main se ek film main balaatkaar dikhaaya jaataa he or 18 saal kii umr tak pahunchate-pahunchate ek ausat america hinsa ke dhai lakh or hatya ke prayaas ke 40,000 karname dekh chukaa hota he
 Increased presence of equal status in these, add to the increasing independence of women, who are found everywhere by attaining equal status
 kam-se-kam siddhant rup main, kyonki praayah hi samaaj in yuva mahilaon ke adhikaron kii raksha main sakasham nahin he
 NCB statistics show that more than half of rape victims are aged between 18 and 30 years
 yahaan tak ki kam umr kii bacchiyaan bhi surakshit nahin hai
 a case surfaced in Rajkot this May is significant
 vahaan diyaba naam kii 15 varshiya ladki ek katerr ke saath kaam karti thi
 She was kidnapped by the same autorickshaw driver Dilawar, who used to come and go
 baad main do anjaan log unke saath aa mili or use jabardastee neend kii sui de di
 When he regained consciousness, he found himself in a room in Ahmedabad
 uske baad teenon log 18 din tak uske saath balaatkaar karte rahe, ant main ek din vah unke changul se bhaag nikali
 Dilavar was caught but the remaining two rapists are still missing
 maamle nibatane kii dar behad kam" "aise purushon ko kaayar banane kaa saahas isliye miltaa he ki adaalaton dwaara balaatkaar ke maamle nibatane kii dar behad kam he
 According to the NCRB, only 18 per cent of the cases registered are punishable
 yahaan tak ki bahucharchit maamalon main bhi apradhi batch nikalate hai
 Take the case of 2003, where a Swiss diplomat was picked up from outside the Siri Fort Auditorium in Delhi and raped by two men in a moving car
 beshak bharat ke liye yah bahut sharmindagi dilaane vaala maamla tha, jisamen vahaan kii suraksha ke liye jimmedaar darjan bhar pulisavaalon ko duty main laaparvaahee baratane ke liye nilambit kiya gaya
 Though the police conducted a massive search, even criminals were charged Rs 6 lakh
 kaa puraskaar bhi rakhaa lekin apradhi pakade nahin gaye
 Five years later, the police closed the case in December 2008
 kai maamle adaalaton main lambitaek anya charchit maamle main bhi sajaa milani baaki he
 In 2006, Abhishek Kasliwal, a descendant of the owners of Shriram Mills, gave a lift to a 52-year-old woman in her car from South Mumbai
 vah mahila ko upnagar varli sthit mil parisar main le gaya, jahaan kathith rup se uske saath balaatkaar kiya

 Hanuman ji was born as the son of Anjana in Treta Yuga on the full moon day of Chaitra Shukla
 anjana ke putr hone ke kaaran hi hanuman ji ko anjaneya naam se bhi janaa jaataa he jiskaa arth hota he 'anjana dwaara utpann'
 He also has a name Pawan Putra which is most mentioned in the scriptures
 shastron main hanumanji ko vaatatmaj bhi kaha gaya he, vaatatmaj yani jo vaayu se utpann hua ho
 The story of Hanumanji's birth story is after the marriage of Kikesari and Anjanaka, he was deprived of child happiness
 anjana apni is pidaa ko lekar matang rishi ke paas gayi, tab mantag rishi ne unase kaha- pappa (kai log ise panpa sarovar bhi kehete hai) sarovar ke purv main narsingh ashram he, uski dakshin disha main narayan parvat par swami tirth he vahaan jaakar usamen snaan karke, baarah varsh tak tap or upwas karne par tumhen putr sukh kii prapti hogi
 Anjana meditated with the permission of Matang Rishi and her husband Kesari and lived only on air for twelve years
 ek baar anjana ne 'shuchisnaan' karke sundar vastrabhushan dhaaran kiye
 The wind god, pleased with the penance of Anjana, entered his Karnarandhra and gave him a boon that you will have a bright, penetrating veda-vedanga, Vishvandya Mahabali son like Sun, Agni and Suvarna
 duusari katha main bhagwaan shiv kaa varadaakanjana ne matang rishi evam apane pati kesari se ajna lekar narayan parvat par swami tirth ke paas apane aradhy shivaji kii tapasya shuru kii
 Pleased with penance, Shivji asked him to ask for a donation, Anjana said that in order to be free from the curse of the monk, he has to give birth to Shiva's avatar, so Shiva should be born from his womb as a child
 ‚Äòtathastu‚Äô kahkar shiv antardhyaan ho gaye
 One day after this incident, Anjana was worshiping Shiva and on the other side in Ayodhya, Ikshvaku Vanshi Maharaj Aja's son and Maharaj Dasaratha of Ayodhya, along with his three queens Kaushalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi, received the son Ratna, the sage Shringi
 He was performing the yagna with 'putra Kameshti Yajna'
 yajna kii purnahuti par swayan agni dev ne prakat hokar shringi ko kheer kaa ek swarna paatr (katori) diya or kaha 'rishiver! yah kheer raja kii teenon raniyon ko khilaa do
 The king's wish will definitely be fulfilled
 ' jise teenon raniyon ko khilaanaa tha lekin is dauraan ek chamatkaarik ghatana hui, ek pakshi us kheer kii katori main thodaa sa kheer apane panjon main fansaakar le gaya or tapasya main leevenjana ke haathamein gira diya
 Anjana accepted Shiva's offerings as her and thus Hanumanji was born
 shiv bhagwaan kaa avatar kahe jane vaale hanumanji ko maruti ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he

 antat kya hota he, kya bharat or pakistan ke agent, milakar nurson ko bachaa paaenge ye sab kuch jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Why Watch a very interesting thing in the film is the way of telling the story
 ali abbaas ne iskaa behtareen diarection kiya he
 The cinematography of the film is very good
 wo chaahe registan ke sikvence hon yaa pahaado ke sikvence yaa phir peechha karne vaale sikvence
 Sometimes Salman appears on a horse
 kabhi apane hi andaaj main dushmano kaa peechha karte dikhaai dete hai
 This is a story of international level in a very good way, whose filming is very good
 salmaan kii acting kaabiletarif he
 However, Salman was not much liked in Tubelight
 lekin uske baad ek tareeke se kah sakate hai ki salmaan ne behtareen vaapasi kii he
 solid performance
 jaandaar acting, imoshan or ection
 Katrina Kaif with them is not like coriander in vegetable
 unka bhi behtareen kaam he
 Sajjad, Angad Bedi, Paresh and Girish Karnad have also done excellent roles
 acting ke hisaab se film kaaphi acchhee ban padi he
 Its songs are also very good
 film ke gane bahut achche se filmaae hai ali abbaas ne
 'dil Diya Galla' and 'swag Se Swagat Swagat' are on people's tongues
 film kaa becoground score bahut badhiya he
 a good sci fi movie has been made in the spy thriller

 The dialogues of the film are also very interesting
 kai lihaaj se ye film dekhi ja sakati he
 Why not watch the film's story is a bit long
 ise or chota kiya ja saktaa tha
 The rest is an entertaining film that must be seen once

 Tiger Zinda Hai's budget has been made at around 140-150 crores
 salmaan ne iske liye koi fees nahin lee he

 No major film is at the box office
 isa lihaaj se pehle hi din film 40 karod kaa collection kar sakati he
 Weekends can earn over 100 crores

 ke note najar aa rahe hai
 Then those women gave all the money to their group leader and he counted the money and gave it to a person
 ‚Äîpashchimi uttar pradesh ke hapur jile ke patna muradpur gaanv main ye mahilaayein us group kii sadsy hai, jinhone esavisiel microfinance company se kaamkaaj ke liye chote-chote karj liye hai
 The person depositing the money is the field officer of the company
 kisi mahila ne parchun kii dukaan chalaane ke liye 30,000 ru

 But this world is not seen by the outside world

 The model was so successful that in 2006 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace
 2010 ke baad se bharat main bhi yah prayog pehle se kahin tej hua he
 Here microfinance companies operate under the supervision of the Reserve Bank of India and give loans to people from disadvantaged income groups
 inamen se adhikansh logon ke paas bank main khaataa tak nahin hota
 Nor do these people have property to mortgage
 ye 56 companiyaan desh bhar main faili apni shakhaon or field officers ke jariye logon (vyaavhaarik rup se sirf mahilaon) ko karj detii hai
 The borrower has to assure the company for which the loan has been taken
 isi bijness model par desh main is samay kareeb 3
 50 million people are taking loans from microfinance companies
 yah sankhya desh ke kul iskar daataaon se doguni he
 In the last financial year alone, these companies raised Rs 60,000 crore
 se adhik kaa karj baanta
 The country's growth rate may be 7-8 per cent, but the group loan portfolio of microfinance companies registered a record 84 per cent growth in 2015-16 as compared to 2014-15
 sabase chaunkaane vaali baat yah he ki ek fisadi maamle bhi aise nahin hai, jab companiyon kaa paisa dub gaya ho
 But before starting a business, how do these companies convince people that they are not a chit fund company, which can be champared with their money? Anoop Kumar Singh, MD of Sonata Microfinance Company, gives a direct answer to this question, "mfis can only give loans, cannot deposit people's money
 jab logon kaa paisa jamaa hi nahin kiya jayega, to lekar bhaagane kaa sawaal hi kahaan he
 "so what is the model where the debt is being repaid so faithfully, while the non-performing asset (NPA) of the banks putting thousands of restrictions goes up to seven to eight per cent
" is gutthi ko sulajhaate hue microfinance companiyon kii sanstha or niamak microfinance institutions network kii siio ratna vishvanathan ne india today ko bataaya, ''khaas baat yah he ki lambii-chaudee dand samhita banane ke bajaae behatar kaarobaar ke liye saamaajik taane-bane kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 "actually, instead of lending to any one woman, the loan is given to a group of five, ten or more women
 sadasyon ko yah bataa diya jaataa he ki agar koi mahila karj nahin chukaati to baaki mahilaon ko uskaa paisa dena hoga
 Installment is deposited every fortnight so that there is not much burden of repaying the loan
 lone, jahaan company kii shakha se diya jaataa he, vahiin vasuuli gaanv main hi company ke centre banaakar kii jaati he
 This did not make the women go round the company
 ''yahaan dimag main phir vahi sawaal aayaa ki agar koi mahila kist chukaane se manaa kar de to? patna muradpur kii hansira palat kar sawaal karti hai, ''paisa liya he to dena nahin padegaa? nahin denge to aage karj kaise lenge
 Why to include such people whose intentions are not right? '' hansira ne yah karj hapur main pati kii bartanon kii dukaan ke liye liya he
 At the same time, Shabnam, who takes a loan for the grocer's shop, says, "one does not include the wrong woman in the group, secondly, if someone does not pay the installment, will he live with respect in the village after listening to the taunts of so many people Will be able to '' parchun kii hi dukaan ke liye 35,000 ru
 Rukhsana, who takes a loan of Rs, explains, "started shop with this debt
 itnaa paisa nikal aata he ki 1,050 ru
 Pay the month's installment and save some money
 ham to yah chahenge ki aage se or zyada karj mili
 "in fact, in microfinance, special care is taken to give as much loan as the borrower can easily repay
 arabiai ke spasht aadesh hai ki kisi surat main ek vyakti do se adhik companiyon se lone na le sake
 To ensure this, data of entire companies is shared and updated every 15 days
 microfinance companiyon main byaaj kii dar adhiktam 26 fisadi tak hoti he
 Rakesh Dubey, CEO of SVCL, says, "the microfinance company gets a loan of up to 12 per cent from the bank itself
 phir ise graahak ko diya jaataa he
 "but this rate seems to bite the ears of even the money lender?" "if the loan is repaid at the end of the year, a person will get Rs
 12,500 in lieu of a loan of Rs 10,000," says Dubey
 dene padate
 But every 15 days, by paying the installment, in practice he got Rs 1,100-1,200
 hi byaaj dena padataa he
 In this case, the practical rate is only 12 percent
 '' duusari baat yah ki chote-chote lone main oparating cost bade lone kii tulana main bad jaati he
 When he asked the same question of excess debt to Shakantula Devi of Shyampur village, his answer was, "the biggest feature is that we don't have to pledge anything, whereas earlier Mahajan had to pledge goods to get loan from here
 mahajan kaa karj saal ke ant main puure byaaj ke saath ekamusth chukaana hota tha, jabaki har pandrah din par kist chukaane se karj kaa boj zyada pataa nahin chalata
 '' Shakuntala earned Rs 35,000 for the buffalo

 Her husband sells milk to a cooperative
 unki maang he ki ab to bhens ek lakh ru
 If it comes, then they should be given more loan
 lekin agar ghar kaa koi vyakti bhens ke liye mili karj ko jue main uda de yaa kuch or karne lage tab kya hoga? iskaa jawaab detii hai 50 varshiya sudesh sharma, ''koun-si bhens leni he iskaa faisla gharavaala karata he, lekin pement karne ham khud jate hai
 With the money coming in the hands of women, even the liquor of the family has been left out
 ve ab chupchaap doodh bechney chale jate hai
 Children's fees also come out
 ''agar gaanv kii arthvyavastha main choti dukaan yaa pashupaalan ke liye karj diya ja rahaa he to shaharon main cyclarikshaw karj kaa ek nayaa madhyam banakar ubhara he
 Vijay Microe, managing director of Indian Microcredit (BMC), Lucknow, said, "we have combined microfinance with the central government's Mudra scheme
 rickshaw ke liye ek lakh kaa lone bank se or 40,000 ru
 Till loan was done through MFI
 '' yahaan rickshaw chalaane vaale bhale hi purush hon, lekin lone mahilaon ko hi diya gaya he
 BMC is also giving loans to provide solar spinning wheel in Bihar
 isse mahilaayein har roj 300 ru
 Let's earn a living
 is company kii tarah baaki companiyaan bhi phoonk-foonkkar karj baant rahi hai
 The effect of this is that 99 percent of the people are returning the money on time

 Subramanian Swamy had emerged as a big hero during the Emergency, though he had opened a front against Indira Gandhi before the Emergency
 bharat ke sabase shaktishaalee pradhanmantriyon main se ek indira gandhi ne 1970 bajet ke bahes ke dauraan swami ko avastavik vichaaron vaala santa cloj bataaya tha
 Indira was very much opposed to the liberal economic policies laid by Swamy
 immergency se pehle indira ke khilaaf morchadarasal 1969 main swami dilli iaiti se jud gaye the
 During this time he suggested that India should stay away from the Five Year Plans and should not depend on external aid
 unke anusaar 10 fisadi vikaas dar hasil karnaa sambhav tha
 The same things of Swami Indiraco passed away jiske baad indira gandhi kii naaraazgi ke chalate swami ko disambar 1972 main iaiti dilli kii naukari ganvaani padi
 However, Swamy went to court against it and in 1991 the court verdict came in Swamy's favor
 yahi nahin, apatkaal ke dauraan swami ne indira ko sabase bada gachha diya tha
 At the time, the leaders of the opposition were in jails and those who were outside were being targeted
 is dauraan himmat dikhaate hue swami america se bharat waapas aae, sansad ke suraksha ghere ko todate hue 10 agast 1976 memloksabhaa satramen bhaag liya, or desh se palaayan kar america waapas laut bhi gaye
 Parliament arrived by dodging before Dr
 swami ke naukarshahon ke bich kaaphi sampark the, isliye unhen pehle hi apatkaal ke vishay main pataa chal gaya tha
 Swami and Jayaprakash Narayan were having dinner together on 25 June 1975, during which Swamy told JP that if something big is going to happen, JP did not believe his words and said that Indira Gandhi would not commit such foolishness
 lekin thik agali subah 4
 At 30, he received a call in which he was told indirectly by the police that he was going to catch Swami
 iske baad swami 6 maheenon ke liye bhumigat ho gaye
 At that time JP sent information to Swami that you go to America and make people aware of the emergency there
 uske baad dow swami america main jaakar horvard main professor ban gaye or horvard ke manch kaa upyog karke apatkaal ko lekar america ke 23 rajyon main bharatiyon ko jaagruk karnaa shuru kar diya
 Swami Subramaniam Swamy, who emerged as a hero, thought during the Emergency that he would enter Parliament for a day to make people courageous against the Emergency and would go underground after giving a 2-minute speech
 swami ye siddh karnaa chaahate the ki puraa desh indira gandhi ke niyantran main nahin he
 However, a warrant had already been issued in Swamy's name at that time
 lekin phir bhi wo 10 agast 1976 ke din sansad main gaye or yah desh-videsh ke patrakaron ke saamne yah kahkar nikal gaye ki bharat main prajatantr mar chukaa he
 After that, he went back to America via Swaminapal
 is ghatana se logon ko ek nayaa bal or ve apatkaal ke samay ek nayak ban gaye

 But the other faction in the Sangh wants that Bhaiyyaji Joshi should be left with government responsibility

 Then Bhaiyaji Joshi had said that for the last several years i am saying that i am old now

 If the Sarkaryavah elections are to be held on March 10, the big leaders of the Sangh believe that their health is better than the knee surgery

 kaiyon ke liye yah 'swaagatyogy' kadam tha, to kuch ko katai 'naamanzoor' tha
 The resulting protests divided the country into two poles, raising both fear and hope
 dar is baat ko lekar ki nyaayik antarkalah or chintajanak aarope sabake saamne khule main aa gaye hai jo pehle mushkil se hi kabhi hua hoga
 And the hope is that this will eventually open doors to new reforms and more transparency in the judiciary

 This has pushed Hindustan into a great crisis, because the Constitution has neither laws nor traditions to deal with this kind of situation

 ''sijei mishra ne koi bayaan nahin diya
 But last November, when the 45th Chief Justice, during his four-month tenure, there was an unexpected argument between top judges and the fiery public interest litigation lawyers in a medical college bribery case, he said in the court, "these accusations to this great institution They are being tossed under the conspiracy to taint

 lekin supreme court kerecord se pataa chalata he ki sijei mishra kekarykaal main lambit maamalon kii sankhya ghati he
 There were 2,174 cases in september-october 2017
 isi dauraan yah bhi dekha gaya ki sijei kii adaalat main ek din main 100 se zyada maamle nibataae gaye or adaalat shaam 4 baje chalati rahi
 Long-simmering tension in the Supreme Court first came out on a boil last November, when the CJI was accused of taking a wrong stand in a case related to the medical college scam and in which the former High Court judge was referred to the Supreme Court judge Was said to be offering bribes
 yah vah maamla tha jise vah khud dekh rahe the
 Though he was not accused of taking bribe, senior lawyers repeatedly criticized the CJI for interfering repeatedly and allowing the case to be heard only by his favorite judges
 sijei mishra ke naam likhe gaye patr main chaar jajon ne kaha, ''aise bhi drushtaant rahe hai jinamein desh or sanstha ke liye doorgaami nateezon vaale maamle is adaalat ke pradhan nyaayadhish ne chuninda dhang se ''apni pasand kii'' peethon ko saunpe the, jabaki inhen saunpe jane ke peeche koi viveksangat tark nahin tha
 Vigilance must be taken against it at all costs
 ''jajon kii chitthee main us memorondom of prosijar (emopi) kaa bhi zikr he jo 2015 main engeesi ke faisle ke baad banaaya gaya tha
 The question at its center was: Who will judge the judges? After a 31-day marathon hearing on October 16 that year, five judges of the Supreme Court ‚Äî Justice J

 K
 goyal‚Äîne 99wein samvidhan sanshodhane adhinium 2014 or rashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog adhinium 2014 ko asanvaidhanik or shunya ghoshit kar diya tha
 With this, the 'collegium system' of appointing Supreme Court judges and Chief Justices of High Courts was declared active
 do hisson vaale is faisle main sheersh adaalat ne kaha tha ki centre sarkaar sijei tathaa collegium ke anya sadasyon ke saath salaah-mashvira karke emopi ko antim rup degi
 This was an effective part of it, which spoke of transparency and also whether the government could reject some of the names proposed by the Supreme Court without national security
 lambii samjhauta vaartaayen hui thim or unke baad hi nyaayamurti khehar kii aguai main collegium ne ise antim rup diya tha
 The government was only supposed to publish it, but did not do so, which brought all judicial appointments to a standstill and increased the burden and stress of lawsuits on the courts, as the four judges' letter says
 in do aaropon kii vyakhya karte hue kanoonee adhyeta upendra bakshi kehete hai, chelmeshwar or teen anya bandhuon ne sanvaidhanik paripati kaa najariya apanaaya he ki sijei manamaane dhang se varishthata ko nazarandaaj nahin kar sakate
 They question, "will the CJI oppose this practice?" Once again, the CJI and the collegium finalized the MOP in March 2017 and it was sent to the Center
 chaar jajon ne kaha he ki aap itane ahm maamle ko latakaakar nahin rakh sakate‚Äîaapako tay karnaa hi chahie
 Or call the collegium and let it decide
 bahut sara vakt guzar chukaa he
 He also sent reminder letters
 bakshi kehete hai, ''to yahi aglaa charan he
 It has been suggested that if the final decision on the MOP is not taken, they should accept the government's silence
 sarkaar ko ittila de di gai he, supreme court ko ab emopi uski jagah sthapit kar dena chahie
 "will the CJI do this? The clout of the top judges is more than a clash of ego?" The Supreme Court has a long history of confrontation between the CJI and senior judges

 The only dissenting judge in the NJAC case was J
 chelmeshwar collegium vyavastha main kuch paardarshita chaahate the
 In August 2016, the collegium deferred a decision on the transfer of Kerala High Court judge Dama Seshadri Naidu to his home state of Andhra Pradesh (because he had a professional relationship with Justice Chelameswar's lawyer son and Chief Minister N
 chandrababu naidu ke bhi kareebi the) to chelmeshwar ne apane ko collegium kii baithak se hataa liya tha lekin ve kamare se baahar nahin gaye the jisase is maamle main faisla lataka rahaa tha
 In September 2016, he wrote a three-page letter to CJI Thakur on the lack of transparency in the appointment of judges, which somehow came out
 aktubar 2016 se chelmeshwar sijei samet chaar jajon ke saath jajon kii niyukti kemaamle main nahin baith rahe hai
 Sources in the Supreme Court say that CJI wrote a letter to Chelameswar to attend the collegium meeting but he refused
 asal main collegium kii baithkon main na janaa ek chalan ban gaya he
 Chelameswar has been commenting on the minutes of the meeting
 yahi sijei khehar ke daur main bhi jari rahaa

 em
 Joseph was opposed to not being taken to the Supreme Court
 justise joseph ne hi 2016 main uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan ko khaarij kar diya tha
 In October 2017, when Chelameswar became the second senior judge in the collegium, it was decided that the appointment of the collegium and other recommendations would be made public on the Supreme Court website

 "if the judges of the Supreme Court can pass a constitutional verdict with a view, then why can't these cases be resolved? Aghrya Sengupta, Founder and Research Director of the Law Center for Legal Policy believes that the press conference is only part of the process 
 ve bataate hai, ''jaise shaadi ke maamalon main jab bura daur aa jaataa he, to aap use dabaa-chupa nahin sakate
 You have to talk openly with your partner and find a solution
 '' ve kehete hai ki chaar jajon ke saath halaat jo bhi rahe hon, yah chaar banaam ek jaisaa ban janaa shame kii baat he
 The root of the problem seems to be opacity
 sijei ne shaayad aisi peethen banaain jinase baaki chaar jajon kii sahmati nahin thi
 Such allegations have often been heard for a long time but the functioning of the judiciary is considered to be very transparent so there is no news outside
 sengupta kehete hai, ''ab prashaskeey, prakriyaagat yaa adhikaron ke maamle main nyaayik sudhaar kaa yahi vakt he
 If such an epilogue happened, it would be said to be positive
 ''campan for judicial accountibility and judicial rifomvars (sijeear) ke sadsy tathaa janhit yachika vakil prashanth bhushan ke mutabik chaar jajon kaa uthaaya mudda ekadam sidhaa he
 "four judges are going to decide the CJI roster but they do not have the authority to list cases arbitrarily, especially in the context of sensitive cases," he says
 '' prashanth bhushan kii salaah he ki supreme court ko nishpaksh or taarkik niyamon kaa aadesh paarit karnaa chahie
 But will it work? On January 14, four former judges P
W
 bi
 Sawant (supreme Court), a
 pi
 Shah (chief Justice, Delhi High Court), K
 chandru (madras hycourt) or ech
 Suresh (bombay High Court) wrote an open letter to the CJI and requested him to set up a constitutional bench to deal with sensitive pending cases
 ''yah mudda hal kiya janaa chahie or maamalon ke bantwaare tathaa peeth gathan ke maamle main spasht niyam-kaayade banaae jane chahie
 So that people's trust in the Supreme Court and Judiciary can be maintained
 '' tab tak ke liye suzav diya gaya ki sabhi samvedansheel or mahatvapurn maamalon ke liye paanch varishthatam nyaayadhishon kii ek samvidhan peeth baithai jaae
 But all these reforms have a question: Is there enough evidence for the alleged allegations of corruption against the CJI? There is also a doubt behind the sharing of cases that all this was done so as to influence the results at the instigation of political parties
 mudda sirf chaar banaam ek kaa hi nahin he
 There is also the suspicion that the CJI is relying on peers who may come under the pressure of corruption or pressure
 bakshi kehete hai, ''aise andeh raajnneeti kii vajah se to upaj sakate hai lekin main nahin jaanata ki is vivaad main yah andeh kiya janaa chahie
 However, the debate over the politics of justice has erupted and the Supreme Court may not be able to restore the old credibility

 ‚Äô Director Nishikant Kamat who has made great films like 'mumbai Meri Jaan', 'force', 'lai Bharti'
 nishikant kii ajay devgan ke saath banaai film 'drishyam' film relies hone vaali he
 Our team talked to Nishikant in this regard
 aaiye jaanate hai nishikant kii is film ke bare main
 How was the foundation of the film 'drishyam'? i was shooting for a film in Hyderabad, when he gave me a DVD of 'drishyam' made in South by Viacom and said that once you watch this film
 maine 8 din baad us film ko dekha
 i loved the screenplay of the film
 suspence thriller maine kabhi nahin banaayi thi to sochaa kii ye film jarur banaaungaa
 How did Ajay Devgan come into the film? Ajay Devgan was also told about this film from 'viacom' and when i called Ajay, he said 'let's do it'
 bas unhone skijet bhi nahin suni or coffee pite-pite bas film kii shuruyaat ho gayi
 You have not made a film like this yet? Gee, i have tried to make suspense thriller for the first time after making films like 'dombivli Fast' 'force' 'rhythm Heavy'
 mujhe prayog karnaa pasand he
 Nowadays it is preferred to watch cut-to-cut films, how is 'drishyam' made? It is about two and a half hour film
 mujhe bharosa he kii film kii avadhi zyada prabhavit nahin karegi kyonki kharaab film hoti he to choti bhi badi lagati he or acchhee film kitni bhi badi ho usamen boriyat nahin hoti
 Do you believe in films with 100‚Äì200 crores? i have never fallen behind the number game
 main us gali main jaataa bhi nahin hum
 i like making movies and do the same thing
 baaki upar vaala maalik he
 Do you ever think on behalf of the audience before making a film? i make films only with the view of the audience
 meri 8 filmon ne box offis par acha bijness kiya he
 During the shoot, i always wonder what the audience must be thinking at this moment
 main unki soch ke hisaab se hi chalata hum
 Your second film is being made with John, you are going to make another film with Irrfan as well as with Ritesh, is your second film in talks with Ajay Devgan? i am talking to Ajay
 ham donon ek achche se vishay ke liye intjaar kar rahe hai
 Are you doing the sequel to 'force'? No, i am not doing 'force 2', my problem is bored because i don't like repeating the subject
 maine jon se kaha ki main kuch or karnaa chahta hoon
 So i want to do something new
 kya drishyam, south vaali se puri tarah milti-julati he?nahin sirf 60 pratishat waisi he
 i have changed 40 percent because you cannot tease this film much
 film kaa screenple bahut hi umdaa he
 You also acted in the film '404', now i don't feel like acting? Actually i have always been fond of acting but it never became a passion
 mujhe acting ke ophers aaye bhi the lekin maine manaa kar diya tha, kyonki main filmon kii shooting main vyast tha or bilkul acting nahin kar paata
 Do you think that the credit for the films is given not to the director but to the actor? See, no one will come in my name to watch the film on weekends, if you want to bring millions of people to the theater, then it is important to be a star
 isliye star ko credit milanaa bilkul sahi he
 i have also been a big fan of Amitabh since childhood
 unki filmein kisi bhi ho aaj bhi pehla sho dekhnaa pasand karata hum
 Which actor is your dream to direct? i have only one dream to direct Amitabh Bachchan one day
 sirf vahi ek aise actor hai jinako diarect karne kaa meraa sapana he
 The rest is not my wish
 ek film kar luun to bahut he
 Are you filming 'rocky Handsome' with John? g 'rocky Handsome' is an action film
 isamen jon ek parivaar ko bachaane kii koshish karte hai or phul on jabardast ection he
 The film has been completed
 film main jon 'rocky' kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahe hai
 What is the concept of the film 'madari' with Irrfan Khan? 'madari' does not have a single song, it is a very stilted film, Irrfan Khan's acting will be seen a lot
 ek aise aam aadmi kii kahani he jo samaaj ke muddon se ladata he
 Stagnation is the film i made in 'mumbai Meri Jaan'
 aara ke civil court main visphot
 Death of a constable and a woman
 abhi mujffarpur ke us gaanv kii aag thandi bhi nahin hui thi ki visphot kii yah khabar aa gai
 This is the latest state of Bihar
 kya aise hi halaat ke liye logon ne bihar main vot diya tha? agar nahin to phir aisi sthiti kyon?pichley kuch samay se bihar main aisi ghatnaayen hone lagi hai jo pehle tak nahin hua karti thim
 It all started just before the Lok Sabha elections and it is now becoming the destiny of Bihar
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle vartmaan pradhanmantri narendra modi gandhi maidan main jansabha karne gaye the or usee dauraan unki sabha main bam visphot hua
 Then, on Vijayadashami, there was a stampede in Gandhi Maidan and many people were killed
 kuch din pehle mujffarpur main ek gaanv main hinsak ghatana hui or prashasan mookadarshak bana rahaa
 The mention of all these incidents is because all these incidents reflect administrative inefficiency
 nitish kumaar bihar kii raajnneeti main ek ummid kii tarah aae the
 His arrival had instilled confidence in the people, but after his departure from power, people's trust in administration has decreased
 apradhi bekhauf hue hai
 Incidents are increasing
 karrwai or jaanch kaa bharosa dekar bhi prashasan logon kaa vishwaas nahin jeet paa rahaa he
 The terrorist group was behind the blast in Modi's meeting, but why did the administration not recognize it? At the time of Vijayadashami, when the stampede in Gandhi Maidan, administrative negligence was also revealed
 mujffarpur ke jis gaanv ko gher kar jala diya gaya vah bhi achaanak nahin tha
 It was not possible for thousands of people to gather at one place with weapons without any communication
 kya kar rahaa tha sthaneey prashasan? kya kar rahe the vahaan ke mukhiya, sarpanch, vidhayak? kya jaanch main vidhayak samet sabhi sthaneey prashasan ke adhikariyon kii mobile par hui baatcheet ko bhi shaamil kiya jayega? ummid to nahin he or yahi kaaran he ki logon kaa vishwaas prashasan or shashan donon par kam hote ja rahaa he
 However, the administration cannot be blamed for all these incidents
 prashasan ke lachar hone kaa arth hota he shaasha kaa kamjor hona or bihar main yah saaf dikh rahaa he
 Everyday political statements, the uncertainty of someone being chief minister and being removed are weakening the administration
 apradhi isi kaa laabh uthaa rahe hai or rajya main aatank kaa maahaul bana rahe hai
 The public had seen Nitish Kumar as the Chief Minister of his state and had voted for him
 janata ko centre kii raajnneeti ke liye nitish par bharosa nahin tha or chunaav main yah saaf ho gaya
 Then why Nitish Kumar escaped as Chief Minister? Just to satisfy your importance? Nitish Kumar made the Chief Minister of Bihar someone else whom Nitish Kumar had chosen by the public
 logon kaa bharosa nitish kumaar par tha or unhone ise tod diya
 Can Nitish Kumar escape his responsibility for whatever is happening in the state today? Nitish Kumar will certainly be held responsible for the administration of which people are losing faith, fear of criminals is decreasing, incidents are increasing
 vichaardhaara kii baat kah kar nitish rajya kii janata ko dhokhaa nahin de sakate
 The Modi government has made several important provisions in the annual budget to improve the funding system of political parties
 bajet ke jariye sarkaar ne raajnneetik dalon ko 2000 rupee se adhik cash chanda lene se pratibandhit kar diya he
 It has made it mandatory for all parties to file income tax returns, besides making it mandatory to collect more than 2000 rupees through check or digital transaction
 in praavdhaanon ke alaava ek ahm ghoshnaa or kii gai he jo ki raajnneetik halkon main pehali baar suni gai
 The central government is going to issue electoral bonds and for this it is preparing to amend the rules of the Reserve Bank
 is ghoshnaa ke baad sabake man main ek sawaal he ki kya hai ye elactoral bond? vahiin kya ye rigerv bank ke kisi saamaanya bond ke tarj par kharide or beche jaaenge or is kharid farokht main raajnneetik dalon kii kya bhoomika rahegi
 What happens is the Reserve Bank's Bonds: The Central Reserve Bank regulates the communication and credit system of the currency in the country
 vitt mantralay ke karj ke boj ko kam karne ke liye rigerv bank samay-samay par kai tarah ke bond jari karata he
 These bonds are issued with a 5-year maturity period, although the money invested can be withdrawn by selling these bonds in the market even before maturity
 rigerv bank ke jari in bonds ko sirf bhartiya naagarik or gaiyr-pravasi bharatiyon ko hi kharidne kii ijaajat hoti he
 What is the Electoral Bond? The limited information provided by the Union Government in the budget can only be understood that the proposed electoral bond will be used for political funding in the country
 elactoral bond ke 3 khiladeeis elactoral bond main teen khilaadi honge
 The first donor, which wants to donate funds to political parties
 vah koi vyakti athwa sanstha athwa company ho saktaa he
 Second, national and regional political parties in the country
 or teesraa desh kaa kendriya bank rigerv bank of india
 ALSO READ: Black money will stop with election reform and political earnings! India will be the first country in the world to issue political bonds with the objective of curbing political funding and corruption in politics
 vahiin kuch deshon main raajnneetik partiyon kaa puraa kharch sarkaar dwaara vahan kiya jaataa he jisase raajnneetik dalon main bhrashtachar na panpane paae
 With the help of this bond, efforts will be made to keep the black money received by political parties completely white
 elactoral bond kii kuch khaas baaten- is bond ko koi notephid bank jari karegaa
 - This bond can be purchased only by check or digital payment
 - donor dwaara kharide gaye bond ko skim ke tahat tay samay ke lieraajnneetik dalonko diya jayega
 - Political parties can cash these bonds through their notified bank account
 - is bond ke liye desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dal ko ek bank acount chunaav ayog ke paas notiphoi karana hoga jisamen vah is bond ke paise ko praapt kar sakate hai
 - This electoral bond will be like a bearer check, so that the name of the donor through the bond can be kept secret

 Ponting has backed Smith's return to Australia as Test captain after Smith's ban was lifted
 unhone kaha ki vah ‚Äòjo kuch hua uske baad vah behatar netritvkarta ke rup main vaapasi karegaa
 Both Smith and Bencroft's former wicketkeeper batsman Adam Gilchrist took separate interviews which were telecasted live on Fox Cricket
 in donon is saal ke shuru main capatoun main hui ghatana par apni baat kahi he
 Bencroft said he was instigated by David Warner to tamper with the ball, while Smith claimed that "we give you money for not winning to play" from outgoing Cricket Australia officials, with statements like 'win at all'
 Encouraged the culture of lodging
 smith se CA ne kaha tha- khilne ke liye nahin, jeetne ke liye paise dete hamponting ne kaha, ‚Äòab ye baaten saarvajanik ho gai he
 It will be interesting to see how it reacts

 The court has directed the CBI to show its records
 court ne sibiai se poocha ki he ki jaanch agency ke ke paas tyaagi kii ore se deal main paise lene ke kya saboot hai
 Also, the court asked how many agencies were involved in that meeting when the norms for helicopter purchase were changed in 2005
 sibiai ne apane jawaab main kaha ki agency ke paas tyaagi ke paise lene ke saboot hai or jab vah vaayu sena pramukh the to kai sampattiyaan kharidi gai thim
 Apart from this, 4-5 agencies were involved in the 2005 meeting but they cannot be disclosed right now because all the people involved are under investigation

 lihaaja agar tyaagi kii zamaanat di gai to isse jaanch sidhe taur par prabhavit hogi
 The investigation so far has found significant evidence against Tyagi which will help in linking the scam links
 sibiai ne court main kaha ki maamle main aropiyon ke meeting karne or unki jagahon ko bhi sabit karne ke saboot uske saboot mili hai
 Not much can be disclosed about the investigation as the accused involved in the investigation will alert other people in advance and they can destroy important evidence

 - Input IANS rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav main shiv se congress ke amin khan ne jeet darj kii he
 Voting was held on December 7 for the 200-seat assembly
 barmer jile kii shiv vidhansabha seat par is baar sabaki nazren tiki thim
 Because Manvendra Singh, son of Jaswant Singh, the founding member of BJP, used to be an MLA from here, but due to constant neglect in the party, he joined the Congress
 congress ne is baar bhi apane puraane pratyaashee purv mantri amin khan ko chunaav maidan main utaara or bijepi ne ek baar phir rajput pratyaashee par hi bharosa karte hue khumaan singh par daanv khelaa tha
 The Jaswant Singh Jasol family, which once had a big political interest in Rajasthan politics, has been marginalized since the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne jaswant singh ko barmer se tikat na dekar karnal sonaaram ko khadaa kiya tha
 Since then, the Jasol family's distance from the central leadership of the BJP has steadily increased
 jodhpur sambhag main apni gaurav yatra ke dauraan bhi mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje har vidhansabha seat par prachaar ke liye gayi
 But Manvendra's Shiva did not go to the assembly
 lihaaja bijepi main ahmiyat kam hota dekh maanavendra singh ne 22 sitambar ko barmer ke pachapadara main swabhimaan raily ko sambodhit karte hue bijepi chhodane kaa elaan kar diya
 Ending relations with the BJP for 40 years, Manvendra Singh said, 'lotus flower, big mistake'
 However, Manvendra Singh does not intend to contest the upcoming assembly elections
 maanavendra singh teen baar barmer se loksabhaa chunaav lard chuke hai or 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main saansad bhi bane
 Seeing his role in parliamentary politics, Manvendra Singh has decided to contest the Lok Sabha elections
 jiske baad ummid jataai ja rahi he ki shiv vidhansabha seat se unki patni chitra singh tunaav lard sakati hai
 Talking about Shiva assembly constituency number 134 of Barmer, it is a normal seat
 2011 kii janaganana ke anusaar yahaan kii jansankhya 407320 he jo puri tarah se gramin kshetra hai

 Priyanka has written that the people who committed indecency against me were re-inducted into the party, argued that all is needed in the election
 usee din maine tay kar liya ki is apmaan ke baad mujhe is party se janaa chahie
 In a letter to Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Chaturvedi wrote, "I am writing this resignation very sadly, i joined the Youth Congress Mumbai 10 years ago, because i believe in the ideology of the party, and your inclusive, progressive and liberal politics
 Used to do "mere bacchon ne bhi gaaliyaan khainpriyanka chaturvedi ne aage likhaa, " in 10 saalon main party ne mujhe kai plateform die, jahaan se main party kii vichaardhaara ko aage lekar gai
 "priyanka Chaturvedi said that when the party had gone to its lowest level, she favored the party on many platforms with full devotion, dedication and spirit
 " priyanka chaturvedi ne likhaa, "mujhe aapako yaad dilaane kii jarurat nahin he ki party kii seva karte vakt mujhe kitni nijee dhamkiyaan mili, mujhe badnaam karne kii koshish kii gai, mujhe gaaliyaan mili, itnaa hi nahin mere parivaar ke sadasyon ko jisamen mere bachche bhi shaamil hai unhen bhi ye sab jhelana padaa

 He said that he hoped the party would honor his expectations
 priyanka aage likhti hai, "pichley kuch saptaah main kuch chijen hui, jisase mujhe lag gaya ki meri sevaaon kaa party main mahatv nahin rah gaya he, or main aisi jagah pahunch gai jahaan se waapas nahin aayaa ja saktaa
 At the same time, i am also realizing that the more time i give to the Congress, that will be at the cost of my own prestige and dignity
 "mahila sammaan kii baat hoti he, vyavhaar main nahin dikhtapriyanka ne rahul ko likhaa, "jin chizon se mujhe niraashaa ho rahi he wo ye he ki jahaan party dwaara mahilaon kii suraksha, sammaan or shashaktikaran kii baat kii jaati he, aap bhi inke haq main baat karte hai, lekin yahi cheez party ke kuch netaaon ke vyavhaar main nahin dikhti he
 When i was on an official visit to the party, a serious incident happened to me, but the party ignored it
 is ghatana ke baad mujhe yakeen ho gaya ki ab mere liye aage badhane kaa vakt ho gaya or mujhe congress se baahar focus karnaa chahie
