 The land of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seems to be slipping in Rajasthan
 rajya ke prabharee or party upaadhyaksh avinaash raay khanna ne 1 june ko sampark abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karte hue ashok jain se mulaakaat kii jo pichhali 31 disambar ko rajya ke purv mukhya sachiv ke pad se ritair hue hai
 Khanna made him aware of the policies and schemes of the government! Even after four years of being in power in the state, the BJP is struggling to come up with an effective strategy for the assembly elections this year
 mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje or bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ke bich pradesh ikai ke pramukh ashok paranami ko hataane par sahmati nahin ban paa rahi he
 He was asked to withdraw from April after the defeat in the February by-election
 lekin raaje ne unki jagah gajendra singh shekhavat (rajput) or arjuna meghavaal (dalit), donon ke hi naamon kaa virodh kiya he
 They say that doing so may offend the opposing castes
 andruni sutron ke anusaar, raaje darasal yah nahin chaahatin ki dilli se tay kiye gaye kisi vyakti ko rajya ikai kaa adhyaksh banaaya jaae kyonki ve vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye tikat ke bantwaare main apana puraa niyantran banaae rakhana chaahati hai
 This stalemate has exposed differences between the party high command and Raje
 lekin isse jat, obisi or kuch agadi jatiyaan khush hai
 BJP is facing an anti-incumbency trend from the public in Rajasthan
 isaki ek vajah rajya or centre kii uplabdhiyon ke bare main janata ko avgat karaane main naakaami he
 At the same time, refusal to provide any special package by the Center for water resources is also a reason, while Raje has been demanding it
 khanna or rajya bhaajapa ikai pradhanmantri narendra modi ke chunaav prachaar main utarane se pehle janata kaa mood unki ore modane kii puri koshish kar rahe hai
 Meanwhile, Raje is trying to re-establish his image of a "strict administrative" leader by taking action against non-functioning officials or ordering them to visit
 sutron ke mutabik, pichley chah maheene main kareeb 50 vidhansabha kshetron kaa daura karke mukhyamantri vidhansabha chunaav prachaar shuru karne ke liye sahi vakt kaa intjaar kar rahi hai
 More worrying for Raje and his colleagues is the lack of confidence in the state BJP unit
 ek andruni survey se pataa chalaa he ki zyaadaatar booth str ke kaaryakartaaon ke bas naam hi suchi main rah gaye hai
 On June 1, about one-third of the people invited to a party organization meeting in Jaipur were absent
 us maukey par raaje ne apane mantriyon or vidhayakon ko party kaaryakartaaon ke prati hekdi dikhaane ke liye daant lagaai
 He said that senior party officials are not aware of the achievements of the government and the workers are not able to respond to the Congress campaign

 But the leaders of the grand alliance do not accept Tejashwi's leadership
 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main mahagathbandhan ke netaaon ne tejasvi ko netaa maanakar chunaav ladaa magar 2020 main vidhansabha chunaav main tejasvi mahagathbandhan ke netaa or mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa ho yah mahagathbandhan ke netaaon ko manjuur nahin he
 Did RJD take a unilateral decision? The manner in which the Grand Alliance faced a severe defeat in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections under the leadership of Tejashwi and now RJD has taken a unilateral decision on the 5 seats of Bihar Assembly on October 21 for 4 seats
 But the candidate has announced that there is a lot of anger among the leaders of the Grand Alliance
 tejasvi ke isi kathith manamaani se naaraaz hokar hindustani awam morcha ke rashtriya adhyaksh or purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi tathaa vikasshil insaan party ke adhyaksh mukesh saahani ne upachunaav main argedy ke 2 ummidavaaron ke khilaaf apana ummidavaar utaar diya he
 Jitan Ram Manjhi said that he would first think of Hindustani Awam Morcha national president Jitan Ram Manjhi said, "RJD has made Tejashwi the face of the Chief Minister, it is the opinion of the RJD but it is not the vote of the Grand Alliance
 yah baat sambhav nahin he ki argedy ne tejasvi ko mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa maan liya to mahagathbandhan ke anya netaa bhi yah baat maan le
 Who will be the Chief Minister's candidate in 2020, the leaders of the Grand Alliance will sit together and discuss when the time comes
 'vikasshil insaan party ke adhyaksh mukesh saahani ne bhi tejasvi yadav ke mukhyamantri cheharaa hone par tanj kasate hue kaha he ki kaha ki gathbandhan ke netaa isliye ek saath nahin aae hai taaki kisi ko netaa banaaya ja sake
 Mukesh Sahni, president of Vikas Insan Party, said, “the grand alliance is made up of not only one party but five parties
 2020 main mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa koun hogis par abhi charchaa nahin hui he or mahagathbandhan ke sabhi netaa mil baithkar is par vichaar karenge
 However, the RJD has said that when the time comes, all the leaders of the grand alliance will consider Tejashwi as the chief minister
 party vidhayak bhai birendra ne kaha ki 2020 main tejasvi yadav bhi mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa honge or is par koi bhi samjhauta nahin ho saktaa he
 RJD MLA Bhai Birendra said, "if our government is formed in 2020, then surely Tejashwi will be the Chief Minister

 dekhen unka pehle fasebuk postaello, Facebook! i finally got my very own page
 i hope you'll think of this as a place where we can have real conversations about the most important issues facing our country - a place where you can hear directly from me, and share your own thoughts and stories
 (you can expect some just-for-fun stuff, too
 ) I'm kicking it off by inviting you to take a walk with me in my backyard - something i try to do at the end of the day before i head in for dinner
 i say this often, but that’s because it’s always at the front of my mind: We’ve got to preserve this beautiful planet of ours for our kids and grandkids
 And that means taking serious steps to address climate change once and for all
 Now, we've made a lot of progress to cut carbon pollution here at home, and we're leading the world to take action as well
 But we've got to do more
 In a few weeks, I’m heading to Paris to meet with world leaders about a global agreement to meet this challenge
 i hope you'll join me in speaking out on climate change and educating your friends about why this issue is so important
 At a time when nearly three in four adults online use Facebook, this feels like a great place to do it
 Share your thoughts in the comments, and pass this message on to folks you think need to see it
 If we're all in this together, I'm confident we can solve this and do right by future generations

 Leaders have stepped up efforts to gain support of the dera in the last phase of the Punjab Assembly election campaign
 shuukravaar ko sirsa ke deraa sachcha sauda par maththa techne congress, akali dal or bijepi ke kareeb 40 ummidavaar pahunche
 The formation of a BJP government in Haryana in 2014 tied Sehra to the influential Dera Sacha Sauda of Sirsa
 deraa ke pramukh gurmeet singh ram rahim par gambhir aaropon ke tahat court main maamle chal rahe hai
 But there is a competition among the leaders to seek his blessings
 deraa pramukh ke janmdin ke maukey par sirsa main jashn chal rahaa he jahaan akali dal, congress or bijepi ke ummidavaar haaziri laga rahe hai
 The Malwa area of dera Sacha Sauda in Punjab has lakhs of devotees
 punjab vidhansabha kii 117 siton main se 69 akele malwa main hai
 On Friday, about a dozen Congress candidates reached Dera along with former Punjab Chief Minister and Lehar Gaga candidate Rajinder Kaur Bhattal
 rajinder cor bhattal ne kaha, 'hamaare or deraa ke bich kai baaten ek jaisi hai, jaise deraa nashe ke khilaaf baat karata he, hamaari party bhi nashe ke khilaaf he
 The Dera talks of development while the Akali Dal has destroyed Punjab
 ' isse pehle badal sarkaar ke do mantri or darjan bhar akali dal or bijepi ummidavaar deraa pramukh kaa aashirwad lene pahunche
 Chaman Lal Chatli, father of BJP candidate from Ludhiana, said, 'I have come here to seek blessings for my son from Baba Ji to make him successful
 ' sirsa deraa ke alaava, amritsar ke najadik beas main radha swami dere kaa bhi punjab main khaasaa prabhaav he
 The dera has millions of supporters in Majha and Doaba areas
 yahi vajah he ki sukhbir badal kai baar beas jaakar mattha tech chuke hai
 a few days before the Election Code of Conduct came into force, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi recently stayed overnight at Beas Dera
 tippaniyan Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal has also received blessings in the Ravidas Samaj's Dera Sachkhand near Jalandhar
 2012 main doaba main akali dal ke shandaar pradarshan ke peeche isi dere kaa samarthan bataaya gaya tha
 This dera has a great influence on the Ravidasia society
 doaba main vidhansabha kii 25 siten hai
 Dera Sachkhand General Secretary Satpal Virdi says that Arvind Kejriwal, Captain Amarinder Singh, Badal Saheb, Bibi Bhattal keep coming to our camp
 lekin wo kisi siyaasi makasad se nahin balki apni shraddha se aate hai
 We have nothing to do with politics
 samajashastri dow
 Pramod Kumar says that the deras have come to realize their political importance
 pichley chunaav main deraa sachcha sauda ne ek party ke khilaaf vot dene kaa elaan kiya tha
 But now all the dera are feeling that we can do this
 pehle dere alag-alag partiyon ke ummidavaaron ko samarthan dete the lekin ab kisi ek party ko de rahe hai
 Nakodar also has lakhs of devotees of the Divya Jyoti Sansthan, Dera Swami Jagat Giri Ashram in Nurmahal, whose candidates are circling these camps to get votes
 shuukravaar ko punjab kii purv mukhyamantri or lahar gaaga se ummidavaar rajinder cor bhattal ke saath kareeb ek darjan congressi ummidavaar deraa pahunche
 Rajinder Kaur Bhattal said, 'many things are same between us and Dera, like Dera talks against drugs, our party is also against drugs
 deraa vikaas kii baat karata he jabaki akali dal ne punjab kaa vinaash kiya he
 Earlier, two ministers of the Badal government and a dozen Akali Dal and BJP candidates came to seek the blessings of the Dera chief
 ludhiana se bijepi ummidavaar ke pita chaman laal chatali ne kaha, 'main yahaan baba ji se apane bete ke liye aashirwad lene aayaa hum ki wo use kaamyaab karen
 'apart from Sirsa Dera, Radha Swami Dera in Beas near Amritsar also has a significant influence in Punjab
 maajha or doaba ilaake main dere ke lakhon samarthak hai
 This is the reason why Sukhbir Badal has visited Beas many times
 chunaav aachaar samhita lagu hone se kuch din pehle congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi haal hi main raat bhar beas deraa main ruke the
 The comments aam aadmi party netaa arvind kejariwal bhi jalandhar ke paas ravidaas samaaj ke deraa sachkhand main aashirwad le chuke hai
 The support of this dera was stated to be behind the Akali Dal's spectacular performance in Doaba in 2012
 is deraa kaa ravidasia samaaj par kaaphi prabhaav he
 There are 25 assembly seats in Doaba
 deraa sachkhand ke mahasachiv satpal virdi kehete hai ki hamaare deron par arvind kejariwal, captain amarinder singh, badal sahab, bibi bhattal aate rahete hai
 But he does not come from any political motive but with his devotion
 hamaara raajnneeti se koi lenaa dena nahin
 Sociologist Dr
 pramod kumaar kehete hai ki deron ko apni siyaasi ahmiyat kaa andaja lag gaya he
 In the last election, Dera Sacha Sauda announced to vote against one party
 lekin ab sabhi deron ko lag rahaa he ki ham aisa kar sakate hai
 Earlier the dera used to support candidates of different parties but now they are giving to any one party
 nakodar ke paas nurmahal main divya jyoti santhaan, deraa swami jagat giri ashram ke bhakton kii taadaat bhi lakhon main he, jinka vot hasil karne ke liye partiyon ke ummidavaar in deron ke chakkar kaat rahe hai

 Among the new developments, the biggest concern is that the formation of a new committee should not be turned into a sharp confrontation between different groups of Sikhs
 haryana se khabaren aa rahi hai ki esajipisi ne bahut-se hathiyaarband logon ko haryana ke gurudwaron main bheja he

 "on the other hand, Tejendrapal Singh Timma, the Chief Servant of Gurdwara Baba Deep Singh Shaheed of Ganganagar, alleges," Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal opposes separate Gurdwara Manager Committees for Haryana or other states to somehow maintain their influence over SPGC
 If doing, then the people running the campaign in Haryana also intend to capture the gurdwaras in some way

 Galla said that the government was running away from the discussion and the speaker was supporting them

 Because of this, the House is not able to run

 On the eve of Republic Day, when the President was assuring the people of India about the Constitution, thousands of miles away, he was writing a blog for the celebrities accused in the case of the ailing Finance Minister Bank Frad

 Both have started accusing each other from bribery to influencing the case
 lekin jab desh ke vitt mantri sibiai kii jaanch par sawaal uthaa rahe hai to usee ke saath prabhavit bhi kar rahe hai
 When you ask everyone to face trial on the name of the accused, then why are you writing a blog for these celebrities of the bank sector
 kya vitt mantti bhi jaanate hai ki sibiai ek do kaudi kii sanstha ban kar rah gai he?andhra pradesh, pashchim bengal or chhattisgarh ne sibiai ko apane rajya main pravesh ke adhikaar par pabandi laga di he
 Have you heard that the Prime Minister is opposing it, the Finance Minister is opposing it, the government has gone to appeal to the Supreme Court that it is not compatible with the spirit of federalism
 sibiai ke peshewar sanstha he
 Now when the finance minister is questioning his professionalism, how will you dismiss the rest of the question? Can no Indian leader beat Trump in lying? The question is who is worried about the finance minister? Not a common man
 ve netaa nahin hai jinhen sibiai ke banaae hue jhooth kaa zindagi bhar saamana karnaa padataa he
 They are also not the leaders who are saved from the trap of this CBI

 html Delhi Congress President Ajay Maken has gone abroad for his treatment
 is dauraan unke istife kii khabar saamne ai thi
 However, the Congress has denied Maken's resignation
 maakan ke istife kaa congress ne khandan kiya he
 The Congress said that Ajay Maken's health is poor
 unka ilaaj videsh main chal rahaa he
 Recently, before going abroad, he had met Congress President Shahul Gandhi and the party's Delhi Chief Minister PC Chacko
 bataa den ki dilli kii purv mukhyamantri mukhyamantri shila dikshit kii tabiyat bhi thik nahin he
 Maken and Sheela getting sick just before the Lok Sabha elections is considered a big blow for the weak Congress in the state
 party sutron ke mutabik maakan ne swasthya kaarnon kaa hawala dekar jimmedaari chhodane kii ichha jaahir kii or videsh ravaanaa ho gaye hai
 Ajay Maken wrote a letter to Congress President Rahul Gandhi and said that his health is not good
 ve apana ilaaj videsh main kara rahe hai
 In this case, it is requested to be relieved with immediate effect
 jaankaree ke mutabik maakan ne kaha ki kharaab swasthya ke chalate vah dilli ke logon kii ladaai puri tarah se nahin lard paa rahe hai
 After the Congress' debacle in the 2013 assembly elections, the party high command replaced Arvinder Singh Lovely as state president in place of Jai Prakash Aggarwal
 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle arvinder lavali ko hataakar ajay maakan ko party kii kaman saunpi
 The Municipal Corporation of Delhi elections were held under the leadership of Maken, but he could not lead the party to a big victory
 ajay maakan or prabharee pisi chaako pehle bhi dilli main lagaataar haar ke baad istife kii peshkash kar chuke the
 But Rahul asked him to hold the post till further orders
 ab maakan kii ridh kii haddi kii haddi ke badhane kii samasya unako pareshaan kar rahi thi
 He also went to Kerala for treatment but was not relieved
 iske baad wo do se teen maheene ke liye videsh ilaaj karaane gaye to rahul ko ye sandesh dekar ki unki jagah kisi ko niyukt kar dijie
 Anyway, the central leadership of the Congress is in a mood to ally with AAP and Maken has been an outspoken opponent
 isliye ye bich kaa rasta bhi ho saktaa he

 However, the Delhi and Mumbai Police had made charges against Salem under the death penalty provision
 baad main police aarope waapas karnaa chaahati thi lekin adaalaton ne ise manjuur nahin kiya
 Due to which a long legal battle ensued, finally in September 2010, the Supreme Court rejected his petition

 unka maananaa he ki kisi bhi tarah ke system main kor data surakshit rahata hi he lekin jab yah data kisi kaarykram ke tahat saajha kiya jaataa he to vyakti ke pahchaan sambandhit jaankariyon kaa galat istemaal ho saktaa he
 Second question: What will be the consequences of Aadhaar number leaking? In July 2017, the Aadhaar number, name, address and bank account number of the beneficiaries of the old age pension scheme of the state were shared on the social security website of the Jharkhand government
 jisapar vivaad khadaa ho gaya
 On this dispute, UIDAI said that there is no compromise on the privacy of the person when the Aadhaar number is shared
 haalanki aadhaar act ke anusaar aadhaar number saarvajanik karnaa gaiyrkanoonee mana gaya he
 Critics are of the opinion that in case the Aadhaar number becomes public, the identity of the person may otherwise be used as the number cannot be changed again
 farvari main ahmedabad main ek maamle main police ne paaya ki 32 varshiya tarun sureja naam ke vyakti ne ek mritak ke aadhaar number kaa galat istemaal kar ek finance company ko dedh lakh kii chapat lagaai
 In March, a hotel room in Mumbai was also booked through the fake grounds of Bollywood actress Urvashi Rautela
 teesraa sawaal: kya pramanikta ke liye biometric kaa istemaal hona chahie?uidai kaa tark he ki biometrics, password jaisi pranali se zyada surakshit he
 UIDAI does not believe that biometric credentials are a problem
 aalochakon kii raay he ki aisi takneekee maujuud he jisamen kisi vastu se vyakti ke fingerprint or soshal media par saajha kiye gaye photo ke madhyam se dhokhadhadi kar sakate hai
 In 2014, hackers made fake fingerprints from a high-resolution photo shared on Germany's Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen on social media
 aalochakon kaa doosraa tark yah he ki is tarah ke farjivade ke baad aap apana biometrics to badal nahin sakate
 The case of such fraud was revealed in Hyderabad in July when a SIM card operator activated 6000 SIM cards through Aadhaar-based e-kyc
 chauthaa sawaal: aadhaar suraksha ko lekar badhati ghatnaayenfarvari 2017 main UIDAI ne exis bank, suvidha infosarv or ek anya company ke khilaaf aapraadhik maamla darj karaayaa tha jab ek vyakti ne kul july 2016 se farvari 2017 ke bich biometric ke madhyam se 397 abdhikrut len-dein kii
 Similarly, in August 2017, a developer collected Aadhaar numbers and personal information of thousands of people through fraudulent e-hospital app
 janvari main angreji akhbaar tribune ke khulaase main daawa kiya gaya tha ki karodon logon ke aadhaar number maatra 500 rupee main maujuud software ke jariye hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 In the same month, the English newspaper Hiffington Post claimed that the security feature of Aadhaar registration was disabled through a software
 haalanki is maamle main UIDAI ne apana paksh rakhte hue kaha ki aadhaar sambandhi jaankariyaan and-tu-and inkripted hone ke saath 24x7 security or frod management system kii nigaraanee main rahati hai
 Fifth question: How serious are these flaws regarding Aadhaar? Experts are of the opinion that whether Aadhaar data leakage is a security issue or not can be decided only through security audit
 lekin audit kii jaankaree saarvajanik nahin hai
 The CEO of UIDAI had said that the name cannot be shared due to security reasons
 iran ke raashtrapati mahmud ahmadinejad ne vishwa shaktiyon se parmaanu muddon par unki sarkaar ke saath baatcheet jari rakhane ke liye kaha he
 According to news agency DPA, Ahmadinejad said in a television interview on Tuesday, "there is no other way than to continue the conversation and we are always ready for it

 Ahmadinejad said, "it is not realistic to expect concrete results in the short term as the issue is very complex and requires more time and more interaction
 " unhone kaha, "jahaan tak hamaara sawaal he, to ham sahyog or mitrataa kii khatir baatcheet chaahate hai na ki dushmani badhaane ke liye
 "turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, present in Tehran these days, has announced Turkey's readiness to host nuclear talks in Istanbul
 tehran ne turki ke prastaav kaa swaagat kiya he
 Tehran has been consistently saying that its nuclear programs are peaceful and has dismissed the West's concerns over the secret military program

 It is considered auspicious to keep Tuesday fast for happiness, wealth and fame
 hanuman ji se judi mangalvaar vrath katha kaa paath karke is upwas ko puri shraddha ke saath purna karen
 Tuesday Vrat Katha: It is a matter of ancient times that a Brahmin couple used to live in a city, because they had no children, they were very sad
 har mangalvaar brahman van main hanuman ji kii puja ke karne jaataa tha
 He prayed and wished for a son from Bajrangbali
 uski patni bhi putr kii prapti ke liye mangalvaar kaa vrath karti thi
 At the end of the fast on Tuesday, she used to eat food by offering food to Hanuman
 dhanu kharmaas lagane ke baad bhi kar sakate hai ye shubh kamek baar vrath ke din brahmani ne bhojan nahin bana paaya or na hi hanuman ji ko bhoga laga saki
 Then she pledged that she would eat food on Tuesday next only by offering food to Hanuman
 vah bhukhi pyaasi chah din tak padi rahi
 She fainted on Tuesday
 hanuman ji uski shraddha or bhakthi dekhakar prasann hue
 He gave a son to Brahmani as a blessing and said that it will serve you a lot
 surya kaa dhanu raashi main pravesh, jaaniye anya raashiyon par kya hoga asarbalak ko paakar brahmani bahut khush hui
 He named the child Mars
 kuch samay uparaant jab brahman ghar aayaa, to balak ko dekh poocha ki vah koun he? patni boli ki mangalvaar vrath se prasann hokar hanuman ji ne use yah balak diya he
 Hearing this, the Brahmin could not believe his wife
 ek din mauka paakar brahman ne balak ko kuen main gira diya
 On returning home, the Brahmin asked where is Mangal? Then Mars came back smiling
 use waapas dekhakar brahman chaunk gaya
 On the same night, Bajrangbali appeared in a dream to the Brahmin and told that he had given this son to him
 sach jaanakar brahman bahut khush hua
 After which the Brahmin couple started fasting regularly on Tuesday

 a new Surma in the political theater of Rajasthan is working hard to show his Jauhar
 ab saaf-saaf dikhne laga he ki 38 varshiya sachin payalat apni majboot maujuudagi darj kara rahe hai
 After the party's massive defeat in January 2014, when Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi sent him as the head of the state Congress, he appeared reluctant and upset to the extent of leaving
 vaayu sena afasar se netaa bane pita kaa vahi betaa dhire-dhire magar thos dhang se us shaks ke taur par ubhar rahaa he jo congress ko uske maujuuda sankat se ubaaregaa
 The Rajasthan Congress headquarters in Jaipur was filled with gaiety on March 3 when former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot was reluctant to approve the pilot's leadership
 sambhawatah un par yah ehsaas hoga ki ek noujvaan or saaf taur par zyada karishmai payalat ke haathon hameshaa ke liye unka takhtapalat kiya ja rahaa he
 Above all, his son Vaibhav was denied a party ticket
 is sabase lagaataar do dashakon se bhi zyada samay se pradesh congress cameti par nirvivaad raaj karne vaale gahalot baichaiyn ho uthe or yah jaahir bhi ho gaya
 His face hardened at that time and his line of panic began to show when senior vice-president Vishvendra Singh called upon the party to unite in support of the PCC chief
 vishvendra purv jat riyasat bharatpur ke raja rahe hai or farvari main payalat kii dekh-rekh main 200 anya samarthakon ke saath pradesh congress kaaryakarini main shaamil hue hai
 Vishwendra asked the people present there, "do you all accept the leadership of Sachin Pilot?" It was more of a kind of announcement for the people present there - a clear declaration of intentions
 vahaan choti-si ginati un logon kii bhi thi, jinhone payalat ke liye apane samarthan kaa izhaar kar rahi joshkhrosh se bhari bheed se apane ko alag kar liya
 Lalchand Kataria cut the trowel

 P
 joshi ke bharosemand kataarapradesh congress adhyaksh pad ke daavedaar rahe hai, jo pad 2014 main payalat kii jholii main chalaa gaya
 Vishvendra Singh was well aware that every detail of this meeting would be conveyed to Rahul Gandhi in Delhi, so he deftly raised his question to the veteran leaders of the party on the stage
 eisisi main rajasthan ke prabharee mahasachiv gurudas kaamat ne sabase pehle apana haath uthaaya
 It was a gesture for others to do the same
 tarkeeb kaam ai—pradesh congress ke adhyaksh rah chuke or gahalot ke haathon haashie par daal di gayi girija vyas, dow
 Chandrabhan and B
 di
 Kalla joined a growing crowd of all who supported the pilot
 saaf taur par vikalpaheen or chaitarafa ghir chuke gahalot ne bhi hathiyaar daal die or apane baayen haath se ishaara kiya
 Four days later, on 7 March, he expressed his feelings
 unhone kaha, ''vishvendra aise haath uthaane ke aayojan karte rahete hai
 The PCC President and Leader of the Opposition do lead the election, but the Chief Minister either chooses the high command or the elected MLA
 '' ve ab bhi teesri baar vaapasi kii ummid kar rahe hai
 But the way his own partymen are openly criticizing him, it can also prove to be a fight in his mind
 kai log payalat kaa netritv sweekaar karne kii unki saaf jaahir anichhaa ko khalis 'irshyaa' ke taur par dekh rahe hai
 Vishwendra Singh, who holds an independent position due to his royalty, says that Gehlot is showing little
 unhone kaha, ''mujhe takalif hui
 Gehlot (congress) dodged our efforts to present a united face
 ve apni pari khel chuke hai
 The time has come for him to give his blessings to the pilot
 ''isamen koi shaq nahin ki rajasthan congress main gahalot ke teji se chhijte samarthan ke balboote par hi payalat kaa sitara buland hua he
 Sushil Asopa, a former public health engineer and voluntary retirement joining the Congress in 2014, strongly criticized the former chief minister on Facebook and even suggested that he should retire
 asopa kehete hai ki mukhyamantri ke do kaarykaal, aath saal tak pisisi kii adhyakshata or kai baar kendriya mantri rahane ke baad bhi gahalot jab mukhyamantri bane to unhone apane grih rajya rajasthan main congress kii naav ko sirf dubone kaa hi kaam kiya
 Even independent voices like Pratap Singh Khachariwas, former MLA and nephew of late Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, are disappointed with Gehlot
 ve kehete hai, ''gahalot sareekhe anbhavi netaa ko saarvajanik taur par payalat kii buraai katai nahin kerani chahie thi
 "what is it that makes Ashok Gehlot, like an experienced man Sachin Pilot, so scared of a novice?" The most important thing is that Gehlot, who has always been special to the Gandhi family, now sees a stronger, more youthful and politically smarter and knowledgeable rival in the pilot, who has direct and independent access to the new boss Rahul Gandhi
 gahalot kii aguai main party ko 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main ab tak kii badtareen haar (200 main se 21 siten) jhelni padi, is vajah se bhi halaat unke liye or mushkil ho gaye hai
 It is true that there are no large caste vote banks of Rajasthan in the possession of Pilot coming from Gurjar community, but they have managed to win the trust of Meenas who have a great influence in the elections, which give them like their late father Rajesh Pilot Looked at as a future leader equipped with capabilities
 yahaan tak ki jat bhi payalat ko 'nishpaksh' maanate hai, jo 1998 main mukhyamantri banane ke liye parsaram maderna (jat siyasatdan) ko chalbaaji se pachhadgaye or baad main jaaton ko obisi cote main shaamil karne se anakani karne par gahalot ke khilaaf ho gaye the
 Pilot's decision to induct three senior vice presidents — one Scheduled Caste, one Rajput and one Jat — has created a rift among all castes across Rajasthan
 apane pita kii tarah hi media ko samajhane vaale payalat ko aise netaa ke taur par dekha jaataa he jiske paas rajasthan ke liye ek aadhunik vijan he or jo maujuuda mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje se bhi behatar kshamtaaon se las he
 "his honest and strong youthful charm and his inspiring personality can become difficult for us," says a BJP leader who is constantly seeing Pilot's status rising with a little nervousness
 ''sachin payalat ko koi galatfahami nahin he
 In 2014, while standing against the Modi wave, he had openly believed that it would be difficult to win even one of the 25 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 congress ek bhi seat nahin jeet saki
 Despite this, he decided to contest from Ajmer so that he would not be accused of running back from the fight
 ''kisi maranasann party ko jilane ke liye bahut mehnat lagati he
 "the pilot said in Barmer on 14 March and he emerged with a new force despite the party's annihilation and his own defeat
" sitambar, 2014 main unhone bijepi vidhayakon ke saansad chune jane se khaali hui chaar vidhansabha siton ke upachunaav main sattarudh bijepi ko kadi chunauti pesh kii
 He says, "I kept my confidence up and it brought new life to the mood of the party
" ''congress kii paaramparik sansthaaon—yuva congress, mahila congress, seva dal or enesuai—ke jariye kaam karte hue unhone rajya ikai ko itnaa josh se bhar diya ki usne chaar upachunaavon main se teen main jeet hasil karke sabko chaunkaate hue bada ulatpher kar diya
 This was not enough to make Raje and his party sweat
 payalat kii dekh-rekh main enesuai ne rajasthan vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr sangh ke chunaavon main 2014 or 2015 main lagaataar jeet hasil kii
 a lot of credit for this success of a knowledgeable pilot is attributed to his strong association with the youth of Rajasthan
 jameen se jude netaa khachariyavaas kehete hai, ''ve kisi par meharbaani nahin karte or gutbaji ko jhatak dete hai
 He says he was surprised when Rahul Gandhi put him in charge of the Jaipur Congress unit on the pilot's recommendation
 payalat ne is dharna ko bhi ulat diya ki vipaksh ko satta se bedakhli ke paanch saal main 'haath par haath dharkar baith' janaa chahie
 As PCC chief, he has traveled indiscriminately and visited twice every two years in each of the 33 districts of Rajasthan, where he held meetings with party workers, interacted with youth activists and met veterans
 congress ke ek yuva kaaryakarta kehete hai, ''isamen koi shaq nahin ki ve ab tak ke sabase zyada sulabh party adhyaksh hai
 '' The next assembly elections in Rajasthan will be held in 2018, but Pilot has already come in the election mode
 jab bhi mauka mili, raaje sarkaar ko maat dene ke liye hameshaa taiyaar payalat kehete hai, ''main jaanata hum ki mujhe party ko eent-dar-eent khadaa karnaa he
 "he has consistently kept the attention of the people on the mining scam, even he has knocked on the CAG and in violation of a circular of the Government of India, the disturbances in the allocation of 600 mines on a first come, first serve basis" Forced to investigate
 aktubar, 2015 main raaje ko ye aavanton radd karne pade
 He lashed out at Chief Minister Raje for his failure to rein in the fast growing incidents of rape in Rajasthan
 saamaajik muddon par payalat ne jo rukh akhriyaar kiya, uski vajah se rajasthan ke asardaar enjio kshetra ne unhen hathohath liya he
 However, they still have a long way to go before they face the formidable Raje in the 2018 elections
 unke vaikalpik vijan ke bare main aam logon ko abhi zyada pataa nahin he
 By presenting this, they have to bring people into the party's court
 raaje kii chhavi aise mukhyamantri kii he jo behatar nattejey de sakati hai
 This image more than Gehlot should be a cause for concern for the pilot

 maharashtra ke jalgaanv jile main pataakhaa factory main bheeshan aag lag jane se 30 logon kii maut ho gai
 The fireworks factory was completely gutted
 shahar se dur hone kii vajah se damakal pahunchane main bhi deree hui
 The fireworks factory of Parola village in Jalgaon district became a factory of death
 factory main ek visphot ke saath bhayanak aag bhadak uthi auki dekhte hi dekhte factory main kaam kar kareeb 150 se 200 log chapet main aa gaye
 Due to the explosion, the roof of the factory came down and many people did not even get a chance to save their lives
 darasal parola gaanv, jahaan pataakhaa factory thi vah shahar se thodi duuri par he or is vajah se damakal gadiyon ko maukey par pahunchane main der hui
 Due to the delay in the arrival of the relief team, the number of people who died died increased
 maujuuda samay main number ek test bhartiya team ek divasiy maichon main sheersh sthaan hasil kar sakati he, lekin iske liye unhen bangladesh main trikoniya shrinkhalaa ke sabhi maichon main jeet darj kerani hogi or iske saath hi use pakistan kii team kii aagaamee paanch maichon kii shrinkhalaa main austrailia par jeet kii dua bhi kerani hogi
 India have already achieved Mace in the number one ranking in the Test team, but they are in second place in the ICC ODI rankings by 123 points while the Australian team is on top by 130 points
 lekin bharat ke paas austrailia ko sheersh se hataane kaa mauka he, lekin iske liye dhoni ke dhurandharon ko mirpur main somvaar se shuru hone vaali trikoniya shrinkhalaa main srilanka or mejabaan bangladesh donon ko haraana hoga
 But he will also have to hope that the Pakistani team wins Australia in the five-match series starting on 22 January
 riki ponting kii team ke liye shrinkhalaa main 4-1 yaa isse kharaab parinaam unhen sheersh se hataane ke liye kaaphi hoga, or yah bharat ke paksh main rahegaa

 @janhvikapoor # 21stbirthdaya post shared by sonamkapoor (@sonamkapoor) on Mar 5, 2018 at 11:15 am psthappy Birthday my dearest @janhvikapoor May God Bless you with Happiness Love Peace and Just Everything
 a post shared by Manish Malhotra (@manishmalhotra05) on Mar 5, 2018 at 10:42am pston my birthday, the only thing i ask of all of you is that you love your parents
 Cherish them and devote themselves to making them feel that love
 They have made you
 And i ask that you remember my mother fondly, pray for her soul to rest in peace
 Let the love and adulation you’ll showered on her continue and please know that the biggest part of my mother was the love she shared with papa
 And their love is immortal because there was nothing like it in the whole world
 Nothing as joyful and pure and no two people as devoted to one another as they were
 Please respect that because it hurts to think anyone would ever try to tarnish it
 Preserving the sanctity of what they had would mean the world not only to my mother but also to a man who’s entire being revolved around her, and her two children who are all that remains of their love
 Me and Khushi have lost our mother but papa has lost his "jaan"
 She was so much more than just an actor or a mother or a wife
 She was the ultimate and the best in all these roles
 It mattered a great deal to her to give love and to get love
 For people to be good and gracious and kind
 She didn’t understand frustration or malice or jealousy
 So let's be that
 Let’s be full of only good and give only love
 That would make her happy, to know that even in death, she gave you all something
 The courage and inspiration to fill yourselves with nothing but love and rid yourselves of bitterness in any way and form
 That's what she stood for
 Dignity, strength and innocence
 Thank you for the love and support everyone has shown us in the past couple of days
 It’s given us hope and strength and we can’t thank you all enough
 a post shared by Janhvi Kapoor (@janhvikapoor) on Mar 2, 2018 at 10:09 pm PST mahanayake amitabh bachchan yon to 65 saal se zyada ke ho gayi hai, lekin manoranjan kii duniya main wo phir bhi wo hai most wanted
 So much wanted that Colors Channel is giving one and a half crore rupees to Amitabh in exchange for every episode of his show Bigg Boss
 amitabh kareeb 16 apisod main shirkat karenge
 Mohammad Akshay Kumar, Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan all dreamed of a big career on the small screen to become the most precious star in the world of Sapna Sanjaya TV, so they started the second innings
 ye sab tivi par apni pehali pari main amitabh bachchan kii 'koun banegaa karodpati' kii lokapriyata ko chhu bhi nahin paye the, lekin lagata he duusari pari main ek baar phir sabko munh kii khaani pad sakati he
 Amitabh Bachchan is being given one and a half crore rupees for every episode of Bigg Boss starting on Colors
 tivi par abhi kisi bhi sitare ko itnaa paisa nahin mil rahaa he
 That is, the elderly Amitabh Bachchan still has a lot of power left
 amitabh sabase mahange tivi kalakarsutron ke mutabik amitabh bachchan ko big bos ke har apisod ke liye dedh karod rupayon main sin kiya gaya he
 After that comes the number of Akshay Kumar
 kehete hai ki akshay kumaar ne khataron ke khilaadi ke har apisod ke liye sava karod le rahe hai
 Salman is taking around ninety lakh rupees for every episode of Sony TV show Dus Ka Dum
 kehete hai star plus ke sho paanchavi paas ke liye shahrukh ke har apisod kii keemat thi 75 lakh
 That is, Amitabh's graph is still the highest today
 karaate hai taazgi kaa ehsasjaahir he amitabh jitani baar parade par aate hai, utani baar nai taazgi kaa ahsaas karaate hai
 This is the reason why no one is able to become Amitabh
 cinema kaa ye shahenshaah ab ban gaya tivi kaa big bos
 It is proving true in Bollywood that Amitabh may have grown old, but he is a great hero
 amitabh kii saakh kaa sawalbig bos ke har apisod ke badale dedh karod rupee lekar amitabh ne apana dam to dikhaa diya, lekin sabase bada sawaal hai ki amitabh kaise bachaayenge apni saakh, kyonki amitabh kii garima jitani oonchi hai, pichley donon big bos unte hi foohad sabit ho chuke hai
 It will be Amitabh's responsibility to take one and a half crore rupees to present the real face hidden behind the fake face of every celebrity
 manoranjan kii duniya ke mahanayake amitabh bachchan ko ab tak jisane bhi tivi par dekha he use lekar logon ke man main ek chhavi he
 Amitabh's gentle, gracious and loud voice
 behad sanjeeda or garimamay sho kaa naam tha koun banegaa karodpati
 Intellectualism has nothing to do with the audience that Amitabh used to see on TV till now, he had an intellectual level, but now the same Amitabh is coming on a show that has nothing to do with intellectualism
 khud amitabh jaisi shakhsiyat ke liye mushkil ye he ki kaise karenge roj-roj aise jhagade-fasaadon kaa samaanaa
 How will they face such stupidity
 kaise bardaasht karenge big bos kii waisi bhashaa ko jo amitabh jaisi mahaan shakhsiyat se ratti bhar bhi ittefaq nahi ankhti he
 The guests will have to take care if Amitabh is a Big Boss, then his guests will also have to take care of their dignity
 aise main jo bhi hastiyaan big bos kaa hissaa banengi, un par hameshaa amitabh kii shakhsiyat kaa sammaan haaavee rahegaa
 If the old format of bigboss remains the same for entertainment, then Amitabh does not have to say that where are you stuck with one and a half crores? aam aadmi party (aap) kii netaa shajia ilmi ne kaha he ki muslim vot bant jate hai, kyonki ve zyada hi dharmanirpeksh hai or unhen kuch sampradayik ho janaa chahie tathaa 'apane nijee hit' ko dhyaan main rakhkar vot daalana chahie
 Shazia said, do not be too secular
 musalmaan bahut hi zyada dharmanirpeksh hote hai, unhen sampradayik bananaa chahie
 They are not communal and do not vote for themselves
 arvind kejariwal hamaare hai
 Muslims remained secular for a long time
 
 
 congress ko vot diya or unhen jitaane main madad kii
 Don't be so secular and look at your home (community) this time too
 unhone kaha, anya dalon ke apane ekajute votbank hai or muslim vot bant jate hai
 This is a controversial statement, but we should look at our interests
 gajiabad kii 'aap' pratyaashee ek video main muslim samudaay ke sadasyon se yah baatcheet karte hue najar aa rahi hai
 In a message released on Twitter, the Aam Aadmi Party disassociated itself from this statement and said, "all our representatives should be cautious in choosing the words, so that there is no scope for misinterpretation"
 'aap' netaa manish sitaudiya ne twit kiya, maine shajia kii clip dekhi
 They should not say that
 'aap' sampradayik niti main vishwaas nahin karti
 Our politics is to unite all Indians
 ilmi ke bayaan par vivaad chhidane ke baad gajiabad se 'aap' pratyaashee ne kaha ki unhone aisi koi tippanee nahin kii he, jisase ghrinaa failati ho
 He said, i stand by it
 maine kaha tha ki hamen samudaay ke bare main pehle sochna chahie
 Why are we secular when others are not secular
 yah shabdon se khelnaa he
 Leader of Opposition in Delhi Legislative Assembly Vijender Gupta has demanded the Delhi government to immediately enact a clear, transparent and parent-friendly law for admission to nursery classes
 bagaiyr kanoon banaae vah lakhon kamjor or vanchit varg ke bacchon ko nijee skulon main pravesh nahin dilaa paaegi
 Gupta has accused the Kejriwal government of colluding with the owners of private schools, saying that in November 2015, the Delhi government had banned the screening process being done by schools by bringing a bill without enacting a law
 aisa isliye kiya gaya tha, taaki sarkaar se sasti daron parajameen praptakarne vaale skool maalikon ko abhibhavakon se donneton vasuulne kaa rasta band na ho
 The Delhi government is with the school owners for admission in nursery classes, the decision of schools to collect arbitrary fees and exploitation of private employees by paying them low wages to their employees
 isiilie navambar 2015 ke baad se aaj tak sarkaar nenrsry pravesh ke liye niyamit kanoonnheen banaaya he
 Vijendra Gupta said that unless strict laws are enacted, the owners of private schools will not allow the children of economically weaker and disadvantaged sections to enter their schools
 maanya kanoon ke abhaav mensarkaradwara jari kiye gaye prashasnic adeshon ko maanane ke lienijee scoolbadhya nahin hai, yah jaanate hue bhi sarkaar sirf prashasnic aadesh jari karke nijee skulon ko manamaani karne or bhrashtachar karne kii khuli chhot de rahi he
 This has led to millions of parents being openly exploited financially
 jo abhibhavak baari fees or donneton dene kii aarthik haisiyat nahin rakhte hai, unke bacchon kaa bhavishya nae shiksha satr main andhere main hoga, kyonki unhen skulon main pravesh nahin mil paaegaa

 pichley dinon kii kai ghatnaon ko jodakar,sabak ko antarim bajet main lagu kiya jaae,to bharat kii tasviir badal sakati he
 First incident - the government failed to provide employment to two crore youths every year, gave a tingling of reservation on the economic scale
 duusari ghatana - desh ke sheersh udyogpati mukesh ambani ne data upniveshwaad par chintaa vyakt karte huemphnarendra modi se gandhi kii tarj par rashtriya andolan shuru karne kii maang kii
 Third incident - Oxfam report stated that inequality in India is increasing at a rapid pace and one per cent of people in the country own 51 per cent of the property
 chauthi ghatana - modi sarkaar ke aakhri bajet ko antarim vittamantri piyush goyal1farvari ko pesh karenge
 By implementing these 10-formula themes in the interim budget, Goyal can pave the way for making India an economic superpower and a world guru
 swaraj,swadeshi or mek-in-india :tilak ke swaraj or gandhi ke swadeshi kii tarj par modi sarkaar kaa mek-in-india kaarykram,ek acha naaraa he,par hakeekat main iske liye sahi prayaas nahin ho rahe
 Raw material from India used to go to England during the period of European colonialism and India was a big market for their companies
 or ab digital india ke daur main internet or smartphonon ke madhyam se bharat kaa sarkari or nijee data videshon main jane ke daur ko data upniveshwaad mana ja rahaa he
 There should be provisions in the budget to break this evil system of neo-colonialism
 tel jaise bahumoolya data ko sarkaar kyon samajhe bekaar :i-kamrs,soshal media or pement bainkon ke madhyam se bharatiyon kaa data videsh ja rahaa he or ab videshi companiyon kii nigaah aadhaar data kii sendhamari par lagi he
 The individual's personal data may appear to be worthless, but in a country with a population of 127 crore, the data of groups is new-age oil
 sarkaar ke aakhri bajet main is pahalu ko nazarandaaj karnaa,arthvyastha kii sehat ke liye khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 Indian data should be in Indian server: On the lines of East India Company, foreign Internet companies are monetizing the data of Indians, which is getting a sense of being synonymous with Digital India
 rigerv bank dwaara data ke sthaniyakaran ke bare main april, 2018main niyam banaae gaye hai,jinhen internet lobby ke dabaav kii vajah se lagu nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 With the rule of storing data in India, an average of 1,000 youth per server and millions of people collectively will get direct and indirect employment
 bhartiya daftar ko mili kanoonee manyata :internet,i-commers or soshal media kii adhikansh companiyon kaa mukhyalay america main or vittiya karyaalay ireland jaise tex haven main sthit he
 Despite these companies opening 100 per cent subsidiaries in India, it is unfortunate for the bureaucracy not to consider them as Indian offices
 is bare main kanoonee spashtataa laane ke liye vitt vidheyak ke madhyam se sarkaar ko zaruri badlaav karnaa chahie
 Appointment of Grievance Officer in India: According to the IT Act and the rules of 2011, it is necessary to appoint a Grievance Officer by every Internet company and for this the Delhi High Court had also ordered the government in August 2013
 kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ke nirdesh ko darkinar karke whotsap ne bhi bhartiya kaarobaar ke liye shikaayat adhikari ko america main baitha diya he
 There is a legal change in this in the budget session
 data suraksha kanoon jald paarit ho :supreme court ke nau jajon ne samuhik sahmati se privesi or data suraksha ke bare main do varsh pehle aitihaasik nirnay diya tha
 The Justice AP Shah Committee under the previous UPA Government and now the Justice Srikrishna Committee under the NDA have made detailed recommendations regarding data security
 aarakshan or teen talaak par turant kanoon banane vaali sarkaar,data kii suraksha or is par tex kii vyavastha banaakar digital kranti ko sahi arthon main sunishchit kar sakati he
 Change in income tax and GST law: After Govindacharya's plea, the government had imposed a 6% Google tax on internet companies, but after that the car stopped again
 data ke pratyaksh or apratyaksh kaarobaar or transfar parakhghshaika kanoon lagu kar diya jaae to data suraksha ke saath kharbon dollar kii tex aamadani bhi hogi
 With the enactment of law to recognize Indian offices of foreign internet companies as Permanent Establishment under the Income Tax Act, the country may have a tax revenue of more than five lakh crores
 digital india main badhati asamanta par oxfam kii report :supreme court ke jaj sanjay kishan kaul ne privesi ke aitihaasik jajment main kaha tha ki ubar ke paas taxi nahin,alibaba ke paas maal nahin or fasebuk ke paas contint nahin he,phir bhi ve vishwa kii sabase dhani companiyaan hai
 By taking the data of Digital India abroad and its illegal business, the prosperity of these companies is increasing, but India is becoming poor
 data ke kaarobaar main tex se bharat main nivesh or vyapaar main badhotaree hogi,jisase aarthik or saamaajik asamanta kam ho sakegi,jo sarkaar kaa sanvaidhanik uttardaayitv bhi he
 Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary and Vishwaguru's dream: how a strong India, like a golden bird, will make the world Guru fly high with the wings of plastic money of foreign digital
 
 
 ?gandhi kii150veen jainti par vishwaguru or aarthik mahashakti banane ke swapn ko saakaar karne ke liye bharat kaa data bhartiya sarwar main aandolan hetu bajtiy praavdhaan hone chahie
 US pressure, save Indian democracy from Internet lobbies: $ 23 million annually is spent by Google and $ 13 million is spent by Facebook for lobbying in the US alone
 internet companiyaan dwaara america suraksha agenciyon ke saath bharatiyon kaa bahumoolya data saajha karne ke saath bhartiya chunaavon main dakhsandaji bhi kii jaati he
 With the slogans of Bendendi's FDI and Ease of Doing Business's capricious indexes, if foreign companies are forced to comply with laws, Make in India will be successful in the true sense
 bibrint inwestors meet or oonchi murtiyon kii sthapana karwaane ke saathchfmodi ko patel jaisi dridhtaa se videshi companiyon par nakel ab kasni chahie,tabhi data ke khel main bharat ko tel kaa bonus milegaa

 bharat or china main ab bhi takaraav kii sthiti bani he
 Recently the Chinese Army stopped a patrol of the Indian Army from reaching the Line of Actual Control
 yahi nahin, china ne bhartiya seemaa main 5 kilometre kii sadak bhi bana lee he
 This road is built up to 'finger-4' area
 chini sena dwaara bhartiya gashti dal ko 17 may ko us vakt roka gaya jab iske do hi din baad china ke pradhanmantri lee quing dilli pahunchane vaale the
 The incident of the Indian patrol being stopped happened near the famous 'finger-8' area named Siri Zap
 chini pradhanmantri ke daure se pehle elaan kiya gaya tha ki bhartiya seemaa main 19 kilometre bheetar tak hui chini sena kii ghuspaith se paidaa hui takaraav kii sthiti khatm ho gayi he
 It was claimed that the intruding Chinese soldiers had moved back to their former positions
 udhampur ke thalsena pravaktaa ne to is ghatana par koi tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya par sarkari sutron ne kaha ki finger-8 ilaake main thodi-bahut takaraav kii sthiti bani thi, jiske baad thalsena kaa gashti dal LAC kii ore bade bina waapas laut gaya
 Sources said that after this incident, 14 Corps deployed in Ladakh stopped all patrolling
 dipasang main bheje jane vaale gashti dal ko bhi roak diya gaya
 In Dipsang itself, the Chinese army had put up their tents for about three weeks
 sutron ne kaha ki china ‘finger-4’ ilaake tak sadak banane main kaamyaab rahaa he
 The 'finger-4' area also falls under the Siri Zap area and is 5 km from LAC in the Indian border
 chini apane nakshe main daawa karte hai ki yah ilaaka unke seemaa-kshetra main aata he jabaki bhartiya sena kaa daawa he ki yah ladakh kaa hissaa he
 The 1962 war is often cited in relation to this area when the Indian and Chinese forces fought a fierce battle in this area
 is ilaake main chini sena (piele) se loha lene ke liye major dhan singh thapa ko paramveer chakra se nawaja gaya tha
 However, sources said that at a time when India is trying to justify its stand at the negotiating table, the Chinese army has made a road claiming that the area is part of Aksai Chin
 unhone bataaya ki kai dfa bhartiya sena ne isi sadak kaa istemaal gasht ke liye kiya he or is par apana daawa jataati rahi he
 The Chinese incursion into the remote Daulat Beg Oldi sector is believed to have taken place on 15 April, as a surveillance tower was constructed in Chumar Division
 is saal march maheene ke aakhri hafte main hui flag meetingon ke byore ke mutabik, chini paksh ne elesi ke paas chumaar divijan main nigaraanee tower ke nirmaan par aitraaj jataayaa tha
 Chumar Division is about 300 km from here
 sutron ne bataaya ki takaraav kii sthiti khatm hone kii ghoshnaa ke baad rocky nob jaise kuch khaas ilaakon main bhartiya suraksha balon ne gasht karnaa band kar diya
 Chumar, a remote village on the ladakh-himachal Pradesh border, has been a major issue for China and has been claiming that the area is part of it
 is ilaake main china kamobesh har saal helicopter ke jariye ghuspaith karata he
 Last year, China had deployed some PLA personnel here in this area and removed temporary storage tents of the Army and ITBP
 china kii seemaa se is ilaake main najar nahin rakhi ja sakati he par bharat ne kareeb aakhri bindu tak sadak bana rakhi he jo nau ton tak kaa bhaar sah sakati he
 There seems to be some lack of coordination among the various Indian Defense Forces
 itibipi ne kendriya grih mantralay se shikaayat kii he ki unhen 5 may ko china ke saath hui flats meeting se baahar rakhaa gaya
 At the flag meeting held on 5 May itself, the two countries decided to withdraw their respective forces

 isi ke saath film industry bhijghshth bilka intjaar kar rahi he
 Here too, people are eager to know whether the budget for making films will increase or decrease after this bill
 isse chote bajet kii filmein bananaa main phayda rah jayega yaa nahin or saath hi sitaron kii fees par iskaa kaa asar hoga
 Will the film producer-director Vipul Shah like Bahubali again be able to say that whether the films are big or small, GST will affect everyone
 haalanki saath hi wo ye bhi maanate hai ki film industry ke alaava duusare bijness ke liye bhi ye acha kadam he
 Vipul says that it would be difficult to make a big film like Bahubali, but more difficult than that would come in small films, or say films costing up to 5 crores
 chote nirmaataa ke bhi usitax slabamein aane se 5 karod vaali film kaa bajet aujayega
 Then Hindi films will be made less, while producer Mukesh Bhatt says that this will be like breaking the back of the film industry in a way and it will end the small producer
 pehle se hi theatre kii maaramaari he or upar se is bill se or baari nuksaan hoga
 Mukesh says that 28 percent means that prices of everything will go up
 haal ye hoga ki hindi filmein kam banengi or cinema gharon main ham hollywood kii filmein zyada dekhenge, jo amir varg kaa insaan hi dekh paaegaa
 Mukesh Bhatt also says that the country's government should adopt the good things of other countries
 har jagah kala or antertenment ke kshetra main badhaava diya jaataa he lekin bharat main iskaa ulat ho rahaa he
 Tiger trusts - people will definitely watch movies
 Will the people of the film industry meet Arun Jaitley and explain his point? On this question, Mukesh said- The meeting has been done many times before but it does not show any benefit
 aise main hamen industry ke achche din kaa to nahin pataa lekin bure din jarur aate dikh rahe hai
 At the same time, the young generation hero Tiger Shroff says on GST that GST will have an impact on the film industry, but he is confident that people watching the film will still watch the film
 bas iske liye bollywood ko bhi acchhee filmon par dhyaan dena hoga

 We all are well aware that eating late at night carries the risk of insomnia and many health problems with weight gain
 lekin phir bhi aajkal adhiktar log der raat tak kuch na kuch khate rahete hai
 Every food has its own specialty
 lekin koun si cheez kab khaaen, iskaa hamen dhyaan rakhana chahie
 Because some things are such that eating them affects both our health and sleep
 ham aapako kuch aisi chizon ke bare main bataa rahe hai, jinhen raat ke samay khaane se bachanaa chahie
 Do not consume these 6 things at night - 1
 french friese-tale hue aalu sabhi ko pasand hote hai, lekin ve aapaki neend or swasthya ke liye bilkul bhi achche nahin hote hai
 Avoid consuming french fries and potato chips at night

 Pizza - a late-night snack tastes good as a snack, but be careful before ordering it

 tajmahal ke shahar main bhi yogiraj aane ke baad aabo-hawa badal gai he
 You realize this yourself while walking on the streets of Agra
 maheene bhar pehle tak yah kahaan sambhav tha ki masjid ke deevaaron par bhi koi bhagava jhanda laga jaae or kisi kii himmat naa ho use hataane kii
 But even if the zeal of the Hindutva organization was limited to placing the flag on the walls, it was a reward
 bhagava kapade pahanane vaale adityanath yogi neyupi ke mukhyamantriki kursi kya sanbhali, kuch logon ne yah maan liya ki ab gale main bhagava-gamchaa daal lene ke baad kanoon kaa shikanja un par nahin kas saktaa
 The enthusiasm of some people who had earlier called the Samajwadi Party government as a goon government increased so much that they even tried to get into the police station and beat the police officers and get the accused released from detention
 jab marpet ke aarope main paanch logon ko police ne pakadaagara shahar ke sadar thane menkhadi kareeb 70-80 bike or scooter is baat kii gavaah he ki yahaan par shanivaar kii shaam ko updraviyon or police ke bich kaisaa takaraav hua tha
 In fact, the police had caught five people here, who were accused of assaulting some people at the Fatehpur Sikri police station in Agra
 jab us thane par unhen chhudaane ke liye aasapaas ke log ikattha hokar hangaamaa karne lage or baat police adhikariyon ke saath hathapayee tak aa gai to aropiyon ko police vahaan se nikaalkar 40 kilometre dur agra shahar ke sadar thane main le ai
 But people of Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad also came here to rescue their comrades
 pehle dharna pradarshan hua or jab baat nahin bani to unhone jabardastee hawalat se aropiyon ko chhudaane kii koshish kii
 At first the police station was stoned but when the police started lathi in response, people ran away and their vehicles were left here which are now standing in the police station
 police par sapa ke agent ke taur par kaam karne kaa aropasdar thane ke inspector vinay kumaar mishra bataate hai ki unhone 14 logon ko jail bhijwa diya he or baaki aropiyon kii bhi talash jari he
 Vinay Kumar Mishra says that on Saturday, the situation became such that there was no option left except to run sticks
 jin logon ne thane main jaakar aropiyon ko chhudaane kii koshish kii unamem bijepi ke udai bhaan singh bhi shaamil the or is baat kaa zikr FIR main bhi kiya gaya he
 But Uday Bhan Singh alleges that despite changing the government, many policemen are acting as agents of the Samajwadi Party government
 unka kahana he ki agra main jo kuch hua uske peeche police waalon kii gaiyr jimmedaarana karrwai hi jimmedaar he
 There is no government pressure on the police, many police officials say that the root cause of all the trouble is that the workers below the BJP and many Hinduist organizations associated with it are disappointed
 unhen ummid thi ki satta badalte hi upar se neeche tak saare police or prashasan ke adhikari badal die jaaenge
 But this did not happen
 agra ke espi gramin manshaaram gautam bataate hai ki kam se kam abhi tak unke upar sarkaar kaa koi dabaav nahin aayaa he
 Other police officials say that as soon as the power is changed, some people want to deposit their dhuns from now so that their work and earnings will continue to work properly

 The number of people who applied in the first month was seven hundred and eight hundred

 Vishwa Hindu Parishad vice-president is looking for police, Sunil Parashar, vice-president of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, is named in the case of assault and police is searching for him
 lekin 'aaj tak' ke saath khaas baatcheet main sunil parashar ne kaha ki police ne bekasoor logon ko berahami se maaraa-peeta he
 After the incident in Agra, we have decided that now those people will not protest
 vishwa hindu parishad aurbajrang dal ke lotub is koshish main lage hai ki agra ke police adhikariyon ko tatkaal yahaan se hataaya jaae taaki unki izzat batch sake
 But at present the police are taking strict action leaving fear of transfer and are trying to find the remaining accused

 The government may also introduce a scheme to provide a fixed amount to farmers selling crops at low prices to compensate for their losses
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kendriya krishi mantri radha mohan singh se milane guuruuvaar ko unke awaas par pahunche the
 He was accompanied by Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad during this period
 isse pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi ne buudhvaar bijepi adhyaksh amit shah, vitt mantri arun jetali or krishi mantri radhamohan singh ke saath baithak kii thi
 During this time, senior officers of the concerned departments were present
 is baithak main kisaanon ko raahat dene ke liye kai vikalpon par charchaa kii gai
 In such a situation, the Modi government is considering a separate scheme for farmers
 is skim ke tahat kam keemat par fasal bechney vaale kisaanon ke nuksaan kii bharpai kii jaaegi
 For this, the government will transfer a specified amount directly to the bank account of the farmer
 sutron ke anusaar modi sarkaar is disha main kadam uthaane liye jald hi alag-alag mantralayon ke saath baithak karke is yojana kaa khaakaa taiyaar karegi
 However, the medium term strategy suggested by the NITI Aayog to the Modi government should also provide relief to the farmers
 iske tahat agar fasalon kii keemten nunatam samarthan mulya (emspi) se neeche girti hai to kisaanon ko sabsidi dekar raahat di jaae
 Looking at the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, the politics has also increased on the farmers
 aise main kendriya krishi mantri ke saath pradhanmantri narendra modi or phir bijepi adhyaksh ke saath baithak ko lekar kayaas lagaae jane lage hai ki centre sarkaar kisaanon ko lekar bada kadam uthaa sakati he

 Talk about Race 3, Thugs of Hindostan, Kalank and Zero, the box office of these four films has surprised the filmmakers

 These 4 films have many things in common
 jaise lambii chaudee starcast, bada binar, bada bajet, A-listors stars, antertenment kaa har factor in filmon main dekhne ko mila
 But a special connection of all four films is that the story of everyone was breathless
 kamjor kahani kii vajah se ye chaaron filmein chaalu masaalon ke hote hui bhi flop ho gayi
 Even big names like Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan and Madhuri dixit-sanjay Dutt could not save these films from being beaten
 # 1
 Kalank, released on 17 April, was said to be the biggest release of 2019
 varun dhawan, aalia bhatta, sanjay dutt, maadhuri dikshit, aditya roy kapur or sonakshi sinha kii maujuudagi bhi film ko bachaa nahin pai
 sanjay-madhuri came together after years of stigma
 lekin kamjor kahani ke aage maadhuri-sanjay kaa kambek or aalia-varun kii peyaring flop rahi

 What lessons will Makers take from the beating of 4 big films? Makers need to take a lesson from these 4 films that were badly ruined at the box office
 ab darshak pehle se smart ho chuke hai
 They are giving more importance to the story than the stars
 soshal media ke daur main logon ke liye film kaa rivyuu or rispons jaanane ke behisaab tareeke hai
 In such a situation, it is difficult for the makers to confuse the audience
 log quality content dekhne ke icchhuk hai
 Many multistarrer big budget films are going to be released in the coming times too
 inamen takht, brahmastra, bharat, student of da year, RRR or saaho shaamil hai
 Now it will have to be seen whether these upcoming films after the stigma, zero, thugs and race-3 are buzzing at the box office or a victim of the flop

 jadyu ne kaha he ki is faisle se janata ko nyaay mila he
 JDU spokesperson Sanjay Singh has been taunting RJD vice-president Shivanand Tiwari, saying that it was because of him that Lalu got the punishment because Shivanand Tiwari was the first to petition the court to investigate the fodder scam
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki sajaa ke elaan ke baad bhale hi shivanand tiwari lalu ke ghar 10, circular road main baithkar ghadiyaali aansu baha rahe hai lekin man hi man man gadgad honge ki unki vajah se lalu ko jail yatra phir se kerani pad rahi he
 Significantly, Shivanand Tiwari had filed a petition in the Patna High Court against Lalu and demanded an inquiry into the fodder scam
 jadyu ne yah bhi sawaal uthaaya ki lalu ke sajaa ke elaan ke baad ab party ko kya kahana he, jabaki isi cese main ek anya doshi jagadish sharma (bhoomihaar) ko 7 saal kii sajaa sunai gai he
 Significantly, at the time of the conviction, the RJD leaders remarked that the former Chief Minister Jagannath Mishra, who is a Brahmin, was acquitted by the judge in the entire case but the backward caste frontier Lalu was convicted
 sanjay singh ne kaha nyaaypalika ko jaateey chashme se dekhne vaale argedy ke netaaon ko shame aani chahie
 Sanjay Singh also took the case that senior RJD leaders like Tanzanand Singh, Abdul Bari Siddiqui, Ramchandra Poorve, Shivanand Tiwari and Raghuvansh Prasad Singh had to accept the leadership of Rabri Devi in the 90s and now Lalu's going to jail After his younger son Tejashwi has to accept the leadership
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki jadyu kaa netritv nitish kumaar jaise ejeeniyar ke haathon main he, vahiin, duusari taraf ab argedy kaa netritv tejasvi jaisenon metricpaas vyakti ke paas he

 Maharashtra and Mumbai? Why not? Mumbai has always considered itself different
 There are possibilities in this game
 shobhaa de ne ye twit kya kiya, maharashtra ke raajnneetik halake main bavaal much gaya
 First came the response of MNS chief Raj Thackeray
 uske baad shivasena netaa or pravaktaa sanjay raut ne kaha ki lagata he shobhaa de ne kisi pej thri party main jaakar sharaab pi lee thi or usee ke nashe main yah baat bol rahi hai
 a case of Maharashtra malevolence should be registered against them and sent to jail
 ensipi netaa nawab malik ne bhi shobhaa de ke twit kii ninda karte hue kaha ki yahaan ke logon ne mumbai ke liye bahut bade balidaan die hai
 Meanwhile, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray made objectionable personal comments on Shobha De
 shobhaa ne ek twit kar kaha tha ki telugana kii tarah mumbai bhi ek alag rajya ban saktaa he
 On this, Thackeray said that creating a separate state is not as easy as getting a divorce and Shobha De should understand this
 mashhoor colomist or nowelist shobhaa de ne twit kiya tha ki ‘maharashtra or mumbai? kyon nahin? mumbai ne hameshaa apni aaazaad pahchaan chaahi he
 No
 is bahes ke kai sire hai
 Raj Thackeray said this on this tweet
 jab shobhaa de se raaj thakare ke riection ke babat poocha gaya to unhone kaha, ‘maine to telugana gathan par vyangy karte hue yah twit kiya tha
 Why was it taken as it is? main to mumbai rajya kii vakaalat nahin kar rahi
 i just wanted to show that what kind of action do the parties start coming in the election
 ’raaj kii pahchaan he bhadakaau bayaan seraj thakare ke bayaan par vah boleen thik he, koi baat nahin, raaj ko is tarah ke bhadakaau bayanon ke liye hi janaa jaataa he
 Raj Thackeray is also a cartoonist
 main unke caments ko utani hi gambhirtha se le rahi hum, jitna gambhirtha se unke cartoon letaa hum
 Dey said that Raj Thackeray should have understood satire better than others
 Shobhaa De @deshobhaa kaa twitxharshtr and Mumbai??? Why not? Mumbai has always fancied itself as an independent entity, anyway
 This game has countless possibilities
 bijepi vaale bole pej 3 party chhap he bayaanshobha de par raajnneetik hamalaa sirf emenes tak simit nahin rahaa
 The target was also targeted by Mumbai BJP President Ashish Shelar
 unhone kaha, 'shobhaa de kaa bayaan behad nindaneey he
 Just by being a part of the page 3 party and writing a column you do not get the right to make such statements
 shobhaa de ko mumbai ke itihaas kii tanik bhi jaankaree nahin he
 NCP said, "learn the history of Mumbai"
 NCP spokesman Nawab Malik said, "105 people were martyred to keep Mumbai a part of Maharashtra
" shobhaa de ko mumbai or maharashtra kaa itihaas jaananaa chahie
 'significantly, after the formation of Telangana, the demand for other small states has increased
 alag-alag dalon ke netaa gorkhaland, vidarbha, purvanchal jaise rajyon kii maang kar rahe hai
 Shobha Dey's tweet can be seen linking these demands
 halaki shobhaa de ne maamle kii gambhirtha ko dekhakar baat ko sanbhaalane kii koshish kii
 And called that tweet just a satire
 lekin tir kaman se nikal chukaa tha

 Now former cricketer and BJP MP Gautam Gambhir has hit back at him
 gambhir ne likhaa ki mufti kaa is tarah sawaal karnaa, haasyaaspad he
 Gautam Gambhir tweeted on Monday, 'though we are talking about a solution to the Kashmir problem
 lekin mahabuuba mufti ke dwaara amit shah kii niti ko krur kahana puri tarah se haasyaaspad he
 History has been a witness to our patience and endurance
 lekin agar oparation ke jariye mere kashmiri log surakshit rahete hai to aisa hi sahi he’
 While i am all for a talk-based solution to Kashmir problem but for @ mehboobamuftito term Shri @ amitshah's process as "brute" is "ridiculously naive"
 History has been witness to our patience and endurance
 But if oppression ensures security for my people, then so be it
 — Gautam Gambhir (@gautamgambhir)june 3, 2019aapako bataa den ki mahabuuba mufti ne somvaar ko twit kar centre sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa tha

 isamen pakistan samet sabhi paksh shaamil hone chahie
 At the same time he targeted Amit Shah, Mufti wrote that if Amit Shah is wishing that the matter will be resolved quickly with the use of force, then it is ridiculous
 Since 1947, Kashmir’s been looked through the prism of security by successive governments
 It's a political problem that needs a political redressal by involving all stakeholders inc Pak

 "this is the success of any writer, and Swig managed it

 The only thing about the book is that apart from Vienna, the memoirs of other places are interesting but they disrupt the flow of the book

 When India fought the war against Pakistan and China, there were many occasions when our warships were not able to fly or land because of the darkness of the night or any other reason
 itnaa hi nahin dushman desh lagaataar hamaare airbase ko bhi apana nishaanaa bana rahe the
 But now the time has changed
 ab kya din or kya raat
 What airbase and what runway
 hamaare jangi jahaaj dushmano ko munh tod jawaab dene ke liye ab kisi ranve yaa airbase ke mohataaj nahin rahe
 They can also fly from any highway or expressway and bomb the enemies
 ye hindustani takat kii numaaish he
 It is a mistake that when the time comes, India can wreak havoc on the enemy from anywhere
 ye is baat kaa bhi saboot he ki ab dushman par tut padane ke liye hindustani jangi jahaaj kisi ranve yaa airbase kaa mohataaj nahin hoga
 He can fly from any such highway and can destroy enemy targets
 jis haive par motor gadiyon ko daudna he usee haive par hindustani jangi bede main shaamil wo tamaam aadhunik jangi jahaaj utre or udaan bhare
 This is part of the preparation that will come in handy in the event of war
 yun mauka to tha agra-lakhanu expresve ke udghaatan kaa, lekin udghaatan kii aupchaarik ravaayaton ke bich jab aasmaan kaa seenaa cheer kar ek-ek kar bhartiya vaayu sena ke chah fiter jetts ne express ve par tach dian kiya, to is aitihaasik manzar kaa gavaah bane hazaron logon ne apana dil tham liya
 Seeing the strength of these two supersonic jets of the Airforce flying at a speed of 2000 kilometers per hour, every Indian's chest was widened with pride
 fiter plane ko apaat sthiti main aise hi express-ve par utaarne kii airforce kii puraani yojana rahi he
 In such a situation, when six fighter jets got the place to land at the inauguration of this new expressway costing 13 thousand two hundred crores of UP, two dreams were fulfilled simultaneously
 ek khwab aam logon ko express milane kii, to duusari airforce ko upi main ek or air strip ke hasil hone kii
 The UP government, along with the Airforce, had already prepared a lot of preparations to implement this scheme
 phir jab tay vakt par ek-ek kar bangaramau ke dhundh bhare aasmaan par ye fiter jetts neeche aae to har koi romaanch se bhar gaya
 There was gaiety in every way
 yojana ke mutabik, somvaar ko yahaan teen miraj 2000 or teen sukhoi vimaanon ko tach dian ke liye aana tha
 But as soon as the first Sukhoi touch came down for the down, a dog came on the expressway
 aise main foran sukhoi ke payalat ko aagaah kiya gaya
 The fighter jet then flew back before reaching the expressway
 lekin iske baad jab express ve ke kareeb sava teen kilometre ke hisse ko phir se senitise kar liya gaya, to ek-ek kar sabhi chah jetts ne express ve ko chuaa or phir waapas ud gaye
 It is not the first time that Indian Airforce has shown itself on an expressway
 isse pehle pichley saal may main airforce ne apane french deslt miraj tu thajend jetts ko mathura ke raaya gaanv ke nazadik yamuna express par utaara tha
 But this was the first time that Sukhoi jets, considered to be the special force of the Airforce, also made a touch down on an expressway
 jaankaron kii maane to jang ke halaat main aksar dushman desh saamne vaale mulk ke air strips ko hi torget karte hai, taaki fiter jetts aage ke hamalon ke liye udaan hi naa bhar saken
 In such a situation, creating a landable condition of fighter jets in a place like express way can prove to be an important alternative system
 somvaar ko bhi airforce ne bangaramau ke paas is eksrasise ko kuch isi iraade se anjaam diya
 How does a highway turn into a runway for warships? Can every highway runway? So the answer is no
 kyonki expresve ko ranve main tabdeel karne ke liye kai ahm chizon kaa hona jaruri he
 The Indian Air Force has mostly chosen the same expressway for takeoff or landing of its warships from where they are close to Pakistan

 joshi ne daawa kiya ki bhrashtachar ko banaaye rakhane ke liye bade kaperarat houseon se labing kii jaati he
 He said, 'such a disgusting form of corruption is being seen that lobbying is done as to who will be made a minister, for which ministry and for whom
 iske liye karodon rupee kaa istemaal hota he
 He said, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh took the responsibility in the coal block allocation case but challenged the CAG, the reporting agency
 unhone kaha ki congress ghotaalon kii pole khulne par dramuk, rakanpa jaise sahyogi dalon ko jimmedaar tehraati rahi he lekin koyala blaak aavanton ghotaale ke samay to chaar saal tak koyala mantralay pradhanmantri ke paas tha
 All this happened under his nose
 joshi ne aarope lagaaya, ‘sarkaar ek haath se bazaar ko or duusare haath se satta ko sambhaal rahi he or janata ko kuchal rahi he
 The government is also stealing and is committing sin
 ’unhone kaha ki aisi sarkaar ko naitik rup se rahane kii ijazat nahin he
 This government is a government of corrupt people for the corrupt by the corrupt
 aam logon se iskaa koi sarokaar nahin he
 Claiming that the BJP has a vision and solution to the problems, he said, 'the only way is to organize the people and form a BJP government to change the government

 Describing the Azad Maidan incident in Mumbai, Assam riots, tension in many cities of Uttar Pradesh as a dangerous situation for the country, the BJP leader said that Uttar Pradesh is sitting on a pile of gunpowder, especially in the current SP government and the Congress at the SP Center Is an ally and Congress has no control over it

 Independence Day is being celebrated with great enthusiasm across the country
 congress party kii antarim adhyaksh bani sonia gandhi ne bhi aaj party kaaryakartaaon ke saath congress mukhyalay par tirangaa fahraaya
 On the occasion of Independence Day, Sonia Gandhi said that in a democratic India there is no place for bigotry and intolerance, yet millions of people face discrimination every day in our country
 bharat ke 73wein swatantraaa diwas par badhai dete hue unhone ek bayaan main kaha, 'vartmaan main bharat sabhi kshetron main teji se aage badha he, lekin hamaare mul main satya, ahimsa, karunaa or atoot deshbhakti ke siddhant he
 He further explained that, 'even after 73 years, there is no place for bigotry, superstition, sectarianism, intolerance or injustice in a democratic and resilient India, yet millions of citizens face discrimination every day
 vastav main hamaari swatantraaa ko poshit karne ke liye hamen chahie ki ham ek raashtra ke rup main ubharate hue har us cheez ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaaen, jo anyaay, ashishnutaa or bhedbhaav se upja ho

 Sonia Gandhi, while praising the soldiers on Independence Day, said, "we must not forget the supreme sacrifice of our armed forces in protecting the integrity of India
" ' After voting for the first phase of Lok Sabha elections, now political parties have stepped up the campaign for the second phase
 duusare charan main uttar pradesh kii 8 loksabhaa siton par 18 april ko matdaan honge
 Like the first phase, the BSP-SP-RLD is also being led by the elephant in the second phase
 aath main se basapa 6 siton par chunavi maidan main he or sapa-areldi ek-ek seat par chunaav lard rahi he
 In this way, there is an electoral contest between Mayawati vs Narendra Modi
 haalanki isi daur main congress pradesh adhyaksh raaj babbar or bijepi kii hema malini kii pratishtha bhi daanv par lagi hui he
 Nagina, Bulandshahr, Agra and Hathras are safe seats in the second phase of UP
 iske alaava amroha, aligarh, mathura or fatehpur sikri seat shaamil hai
 The BJP managed to win all these eight seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main basapa nagina, amroha, bulandshahr, aligarh, agra or fatehpur sikri seat par kismat aajamaa rahi he
 While SP is contesting on Hathras seat and RLD in Mathura seat
 nagina main muslim kingmekarbijanour jile kii nagina loksabhaa seat anusuchit jati ke arakshit he
 In the alliance, this seat has gone to the bsp's account
 yahaan se basapa ne girish chandra, bijepi ne maujuuda saansad yashavanth singh or congress ne purv iees aarake singh kii patni omvati ko utaara he
 On the Nagina seat, both the coalition and the Congress are eyeing the Dalit and Muslim votes
 jabaki bijepi rajput or gaiyr jatav dalit ke saath-saath jat matadaataaon ke sahare dobaaraa jeet darj karnaa chaahati he
 But, 6 lakh Muslim voters are playing the role of kingmakers in this seat
 fatehpur sikri: rajbbar kii kismat daanv parfatehpur sikri loksabhaa seat kaa muqabla trikoniya hota najar aa rahaa he
 From here, the BJP has fielded Rajkumar Chaher by cutting the ticket of its sitting MP Babulal Chaudhary
 jabaki congress se pradesh adhyaksh rajbabbar or basapa se guddu pandit maidan main hai
 In view of the two lakh Jat voters in this seat, the BJP has played bet on the Jat community
 jabaki teen lakh brahman maton ko dhyaan rakhkar basapa ne brahman card khelaa he
 In such a situation, the biggest challenge before the Congress Rajbar is to break the caste equation
 amroha: bijepi banaam baspamroha loksabhaa seat se basapa ne jedies se aae kunwar danish ko maidan main utaara he
 At the same time, BJP has placed bets on its current MP Kanwar Singh Tanwar, while Congress has played on Sachin Chaudhary
 amroha seat ke jaateey sameekaran ko dekhen to kareeb 5 lakh muslim, 2
 5 lakh Dalits, 1 lakh Gurjars, 1 lakh Kashyap, 1
 5 lakh jat or 95 hajaar lodh matadaata hai
 BSP candidates want to reach Parliament with the help of Muslims, Dalits and Jats
 jabaki tanvar gurjar, kashyap, lodh or jat matadaataaon ke saath-saath daliton ko apane paale main laakar gathbandhan kii raah main baadha bananaa chaahate hai
 Bulandshahr: In the battle of two Dalits, BSP has played bet on Bulandshahar seat, Yogesh Verma, BJP its sitting MP Bhola Singh and Congress on Bansi Singh Pahadia
 bulandshahr seat par kareeb 1
 5 lakh Brahmins, 1 lakh Rajputs, 1 lakh Yadavs, 1 lakh Jats, 3
 5 lakh dalit, 2
 There are 5 lakh Muslims and 2 lakh Lodh voters
 2014 main bijepi ne chaar maton se jeet darj kii thi
 This time Yogesh Verma, who came out of the Grand Alliance, is trying to reach the parliament with the help of Dalit, Muslim, Yadav and Jat votes
 lekin bijepi ke bholaa singh lodh, brahman, rajput maton ke sahare ek baar phir jeet kii ummid lagaae hue hai
 Mathura: Challenge for Hema Malini: BJP has once again fielded Hema Malini from Mathura Lok Sabha seat
 jabaki areldi se kunwar narendra singh or congress se mahesh pathak maidan main hai
 There are about 4 lakh Jat community voters here
 jabaki 2
 5 lakh Brahmins and 2
 5 lakh rajput voter bhi hai
 There are as many Dalit voters and close to two and a half million Muslims
 aise main agar areldi ummidavaar rajput ke saath-saath jat muslim or daliton ko saadhane main kaamyaab rahete hai to bijepi ke liye ye seat jeetna lohe ke chane chabane jaisaa ho jayega
 From Aligarh Lok Sabha seat in Aligarh, BJP has fielded sitting MP Satish Gautam and Congress has won Chaudhary Bijendra Singh
 vahiin, basapa ne ajit baalion ko utaara he
 In terms of caste equation, Yadavs, Brahmins, Rajputs and Jats have close to one and a half lakh votes
 jabaki dalit 3 lakh or 2 lakh ke kareeb muslim matadaata hai
 If you look at it from the point of view of votebank, both BSP and Congress have fielded Jat candidates, then BJP has played bet on Brahmin
 hathras sapa banaam bijepihatharas loksabhaa seat sapa ne purv kendriya mantri ramjilaal suman ko maidan utaara he
 At the same time, BJP has fielded Rajvir Singh Balmiki and Congress has fielded Trilokiram Diwakar
 haalanki yah seat jat bahul maani jaati he
 About 3 lakh Jats, 2 lakh Brahmins, 1 on this seat
 5 lakh rajput, 3 lakh dalit, 1
 5 lakh bagels and 1
 25 lakh muslim matadaata hai
 In such a situation, if the SP is able to unite the Jats, Muslims and Dalits, then the BJP may have to chew iron gram
 agra: bijepi-basapa ke bich jangagara surakshit seat par basapa ne manoj soni, bijepi ne espi singh baghel or congress ne prita harith ko maidan main utaara he
 bjp's SP Baghel has lived in SP and BSP, in which the Muslim voters are considered to have a good hold
 is tarah se bijepi ke saath-saath baghel duusare dalon ke votbank ko saadhane main kaamyaab rahete hai to ek baar phir camel khil saktaa he
 But Congress state president Raj Babbar has also represented this seat
 aise main unka bhi apana ek aadhaar he
 While the BSP is hopeful of victory with the help of Dalits and Muslims

 Along with this, some people also praised him for making his mark in the men dominated field
 This is so important
 The idea that masculine is serious and feminine is frivolous limits the options girls see for themselves and their future lives
 This shows them that they don't have to pick between their interests and their identities
 Science is for everyone
 Thank you!that is absolutely cool
 i try to get my 7 year old granddaughter into science
 I've been trying to explain that in case being a princess doesn't work out she needs a career backup plan
 But when she's performing a space walk she'll still be my princess
 YESSS! This is why i hate the anti-pink backlash prevalent among so many mom spaces
 There's nothing wrong with being girly, and it shouldn't preclude you from working in male-dominated areas! https: / / t

 The PM also took former Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in the wraps while giving an example of Kumbh
 piem modi ne kaha ki pandit nehru jab kumbh meley main aae the tab avyavashtha ke chalate bhagdad main hajaaron logon kii maut ho gai thi
 The Congress suppressed this news
 piem ne kaha ki 1954 main congress sarkaar ke dauraan jab pandit nehru pradhanmantri the tab kumbh meley main aaye the, tab avyavashtha ke kaaran bhagdad machane se hajaaron log kuchal kar maare gaye the, lekin na to tatkaaleen media ne yah khabar pramukhataa se dikhaai or na hi mritkon ke parijanon ko koi muaavja mila
 In one or two newspapers, this news appeared in the corner, it was also suppressed
 jin pariwaron ne apano ko khoyaa, unke naamon ko dabaa diya gaya
 At that time, the Congress was in government from Panchayat to Parliament
 ye paap congress ke pradhanmantri ke dauraan hua tha
 Taking a dig at the Congress, PM Modi said that for the last five years, i have been working only with the mantra that in 55 years, the family that ruined the country, i have to fix it in 55 months
 isi bhav ke saath main lagaataar kaam kar rahaa hum
 At this time he does not have any qualified leader for the post of Prime Minister
 piem ne kaha ki aath se 20 siton par ladane vaale bhi pradhanmantri pad kaa sapana dekh rahe hai
 Who can provide the best government at the center? People of Kaushambi have an answer

 Those who are contesting 40 seats also want to become Prime Minister
 piem ne kaha ki unako kya maaloom ki vipaksh kaa netaa banane ke liye bhi 50 se zyada siton kii jarurat padati he
 The PM said that the specialty of this election is that for the first time Congress, which has ruled the country for the first time, is contesting with so few seats
 piem modi ne kaha ki mujhe bataaiye ki jitne pradhanmantri banane ke liye chehre dikh rahe hai, aap un par bharosa kar sakate he kya?unhone sawaal kiya ki jo sapa or basapa vaale gaanv ke gunde ko nahin maar sakate kya vah aatankwaadiyon ko thik kar sakate hai? unhone kaha ki aaj bhi duniya main aatankwaad kaa khatra he
 Earlier there were frequent bomb blasts
 PM modi ne daawa kiya ki jab pandit jawahar laal nehru pradhanmantri the to vah ek baar kumbh meley main gayi the
 Then there was the Congress government from Panchayat to Parliament
 tab avyavashtha ke kaaran kumbh main bhagdad much gai thi, hajaaron log maare gaye the, lekin pandit nehru par koi daag na lag jaae, uske liye ye khabar dabaa di gai
 The media of that time also did not dare to show those news
 modi ne kaha ki kumbh main jin logon ne safai kii unke liye mere man main bahut sammaan rahaa
 They changed people's thinking towards cleanliness in Kumbh
 in safai karne vaale bhaaiyon-bahanon ke pair dhokar mujhe jo punya mila he, wo meri sabase badi puunji he
 He said that when the government changes, the intention changes, then what is the result, this time the Kumbh Mela of Prayagraj showed it

 vahiin trinmul congress ke purv saansad kunal ghosh bhi sibiai ke samaksh poochtacha ke liye pesh honge
 Kunal Ghosh, who arrived in Shillong on Saturday, said that he has been called for questioning by the CBI at 10 am on Sunday
 supreme court ne apane aadesh main poochtacha kii jagah shilong tay kii thi or yah bhi kaha tha ki is dauraan sibiai rajeev kumaar ko giraftaar nahin kar sakati
 Three senior CBI officials questioned Rajiv Kumar for 8 hours on Saturday
 rajeev kumaar par aarope he ki unhone sharada ghotaale ke ahm sabooton se chhedchhad kii he
 The inquiry took place at the CBI office in Auckland, Shillong
 rajeev kumaar ke vakil bishwajit deb ne bataaya ki vah sibiai ke saath sahyog kar rahe hai
 Deb said on Saturday that Rajiv Kumar has come here on the orders of the Supreme Court
 unhone pehle bhi baat maani he or ab bhi aadesh kaa paalan kar rahe hai
 Significantly, after the revelations of the Saradha chit fund scam in West Bengal, Rajiv Kumar was the chairman of the SIT which was set up by the state government to investigate the matter
 lekin baad main supreme court ke aadesh par yah maamla sibiai ko saunp diya gaya
 Rajiv Kumar's lawyer said that Kumar will be present in the CBI office for the second day
 udhar sibiai sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki jaanch agency rajeev kumaar or kunal ghosh kaa aamanaa-saamana kara sakati he
 In fact, the CBI is relying on the letter written by the Trinamool Congress expelled Kunal Ghosh to the Enforcement Directorate which mentions Rajiv Kumar's role in the manner of investigating the scam
 kunal ghosh ne sharada chit fund ghotaale kaa thikra bijepi netaa mukul raay (tab tiemasi main the) or 12 anya logon par phoda tha
 Mukul Rai was once the chief minister of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, but is now in the BJP
 aapako bataa den ki supreme court ne mangalvaar ko apane aadesh main kolkata ke police kamishnar rajeev kumaar ko sibiai ke saamne pesh hone or jaanch main sahyog karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 However, the court had also said in its order that the CBI cannot arrest them during this time
 saath hi court ne dono pakshon kii sahmati se poochtacha ke liye shilong ko chunaa tha
 The CBI team went to Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajiv Kumar last Sunday to question his residence
 lekin police ne sibiai ke adhikariyon ko awaas main daakhil hone se roak diya or unhen hiraasat main le liya
 However, CBI officials were later released after the intervention of the Home Ministry
 jiske baad sibiai ne supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha
 So there Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee sat on a dharna, calling this CBI action politically motivated and an attack on the federal structure
 supreme court ke aadesh ko apni jeet bataate hue 2 din baad unhone apana dharna khatm kiya tha

 mulaayam or akhilesh raaj main saifai mahotsav main aam janata kaa paisa kharch kiya jaataa rahaa or ab yogi raaj main gorakhpur mahotsav main yah kharch barkaraar he
 However, there is a big difference between the events of the two festivals
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke chunavi kshetra gorakhpur main mahotsav kii shuruyaat is saal se ho rahi he, jabaki saifai mahotsav kii shuruyaat 1997 main hui or har saal ise disambar main manaaya jaataa he
 However, due to the party being out of power last year and the mutual tension of leaders at the top level, the old tone of this festival is missing
 sarkari prashasan pichhali baar kii tarah is baar isko lekar gambhir nahin he
 Let's take a look at how much difference is there in the organizing of these two festivals - Akhilesh, who has organized the Saifai festival, is unable to do even though he is opposing the Gorakhpur festival, that only 33 lakh rupees are being spent in Gorakhpur festival
 yogi ke kshetra main mahotsav main 33 lakh ke kharch ke daawey par sapa netaa ajam khan ne sawaal uthaaya he ki jis tarah kaa aayojan kiya ja rahaa he kya itane kam paise main sambhav ho saktaa he

 raashtrapati chunaav ko lekar vipaksh kii guuruuvaar ko hone vaali ahm baithak ke pehle hi kheme main daraar dikhne lagi or jediu ne endie ummidavaar ramnath kovind ko samarthan dene kii ghoshnaa karne ke baad kaha ki vah vipaksh kii baithak main shaamil nahin hogi
 The opposition camp has not announced any names yet, but former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar's meeting with Congress President Sonia Gandhi at her residence has given rise to speculation that she is leading the race
 sutron ne bataaya ki jediu kii ghoshnaa ke baad buudhvaar ko congress tathaa gaiyr-endie dalon ke varisht netaaon ke bich gahan vichaar-vimarsh kaa daur chalaa ki kis prakaar vipaksh ko ekajute rakhaa jaae
 The Congress, which is coordinating the meeting of the opposition, hoped that the leaders of all those parties would attend the Thursday meeting, who attended the lunch hosted by Sonia on 26 May
 is bich ek varisht vam netaa ne kaha ki kuch bhi ho, ham chunaav ladenge
 Asked about the Congress' choice for the election, party spokesperson Manish Tiwari said it was a hypothetical question and the opposition would decide on a joint strategy for the July 17 election
 tiwari ne kaha ki guuruuvaar kii baithak ke baad ek spasht uttar uplabdh hoga
 sp's Naresh Aggarwal said that the opposition parties will jointly decide on any candidate in the meeting
 is bich, kuch vam netaaon ne sapa netaa mulaayam singh yadav ke buudhvaar ko lakhanu main yoga diwas se sambandhit ek kaarykram main maujuud hone kaa zikr kiya, jisamen pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi shaamil hue
 On the other hand, JDU announced on Wednesday that it will support NDA candidate Kovind in the presidential election
 yah vipakshi dalon ke prayaason ke liye ek bada jhatka mana ja rahaa he, jo apana sanyukt ummidavaar utaarna chaahate hai
 The comments party pravaktaa kasee tyaagi ne yah bhi kaha ki jediu kii guuruuvaar ko hone ja rahi vipakshi dalon kii baithak main shaamil nahin hoga
 He said that after the support to Kovind, this meeting has now become 'irrelevant' for his party
 tyaagi ne haalanki kaha ki raashtrapati chunaav main bhaajapa ko jediu kaa samarthan ek 'alag-thalag' ghatana he or yah dal bhavishya main bhagava dal ke khilaaf ekajutata ke liye vipaksh ke prayaason kaa hissaa rahegaa
 He said, 'this isolated incident will not affect our efforts for greater opposition unity
 '(hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) vipakshi kheme ne abhi tak kisi naam kii ghoshnaa nahin kii he, lekin purv loksabhaadhyaksh mira kumaar kii congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se unke nivas par mulaakaat se in atakalon ko bal mila he ki vah daud main aage chal rahi hai
 Sources said that after the announcement of JDU, there was a round of intense discussion between the Congress and senior leaders of non-nda parties on Wednesday how to keep the opposition united
 vipaksh kii baithak kaa samanvay kar rahi congress ne ummid jataai ki un sabhi dalon ke netaa guuruuvaar kii mulaakaat main shaamil honge, jo 26 may ko sonia dwaara die gaye dopaher ke bhoj main shaamil hue the
 Meanwhile, a senior left leader said that whatever happens, we will contest
 chunaav ke liye congress ke vikalp ke bare main puche jane par party pravaktaa manish tiwari ne kaha ki yah ek kaalpanik sawaal he tathaa 17 july ke chunaav ke liye vipaksh ek sanyukt ranneeti ke bare main faisla karegaa
 Tiwari said a clear answer would be available after Thursday's meeting
 sapa ke naresh agarwal ne kaha ki vipakshi dal baithak main sanyukt rup se kisi ummidavaar ke bare main faisla karenge
 Meanwhile, some Left leaders referred to SP leader Mulayam Singh Yadav being present at a function related to Yoga Day in Lucknow on Wednesday, which also included Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 udhar, jediu ne buudhvaar ko ghoshnaa kar di ki vah raashtrapati chunaav main endie ummidavaar kovind kaa samarthan karegi
 This is seen as a major setback for the efforts of opposition parties, who want to field their joint candidate
 tippaniyan Party spokesperson KC Tyagi also said that JDU will not attend the meeting of opposition parties on Thursday
 unhone kaha ki kovind ko samarthan ke baad unki party ke liye yah baithak ab 'apraasangik' ho gai he
 Tyagi, however, said that jdu's support to the BJP in the presidential election is a 'isolated' event and that the party will be part of the opposition's efforts for solidarity against the saffron party in future
 unhone kaha, 'is alag-thalag ghatana kaa vrahatar vipakshi ekta ke hamaare prayaason par koi asar nahin padegaa

 Jung Saheb, who was the Vice Chancellor of Jamia Milia Islamia, was suddenly made the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, and the thing is that since then Delhi has been continuously in the headlines and not in peace

 All the information was coming but the address of Dangal and Jung Saheb's connection to Delhi was not available
 tabhi jamiya ke chaatr rahe mitra ne jang sahab kaa kissa sunaaya ki jab wo jamiya ke kulapati the to unhone ek naatak main mughal badshaah akbar kaa role kiya tha
 Jung Saheb was very much adapted for this role

 The entire play of Delhi's political drama connects with Jang Sahab's Jamia

 ab jaraa chunaavon ke baad kii dilli yaad kiijie kejariwal sahab satta ke 'shighrapatan' ke shikaar hue or dilli main kendriya bhoomika main aa gaye apane jang sahab
 What happened after that, you can understand from the dialogues written below
 aap kaa saleem:main tumhaari ankhon main apni mohabbat kaa ikraar dekhnaa chahta hum anaarakali
 Anarkali (delhi): Dude I'm Confused Let Me See Ini Meeni Mainy Moe
 
 Salim Bhajpai: Anarkali i want to see your love in your eyes
 anaarakali:ankal thand paao or baat bolo vahi jo main samaj jaaun
 Akbar: Your presence is an argument of Naframani
 saleem bhaajapai:shanhashah hamane anaarakali ko apni jindagi mukarrar kar liya he
 Akbar (jung): Our Delhi is not your heart that a maid can become its owner
 aap kaa saleem:meraa dil bhi koi jamiya nahin he jis par aap hukumat kar saken
 Anarkali: Talk to Uncle Tamiz
 
 You know who my father is? Salim Bijpai: King, you gave this fake Salim the reins of Anarkali during our stay and we kept watching
 akbar:or tum kar bhi kya sakate the chanpak?aap kaa saleem:anaarakali hamaari thi hamaari he or hamaari hi rahegi
 Anarkali: Excuse me, come m Shakti, so let it air a little
 you no pichhlaa vaala bahut domineting ho gaya tha haal dekh rahe ho na uskaa
 Akbar: Anarkali Salim Sauri Salim will not let you die and we will not let you live
