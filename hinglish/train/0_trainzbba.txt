 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki lokapal bill ko sansad se paarit hue chaar saal ho chuke hai, lekin abhi tak isko lagu nahin kiya gaya he
 He put a direct question to PM Modi, when will he stop making false promises? Rahul Gandhi has also posted a screenshot of the tweet made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 18 December 2013 regarding Lokpal
 isamen piem modi ne twit kiya tha, ''mujhe bahut garv he ki lokapal bill paas karaane main sushamaa swaraj or arun jetali ke netritv main bijepi saasandon ne sakaaratmak or sakriy bhoomika nibhaai he
 The Congress president said, taunting PM Modi and BJP, "four years have passed, Lokpal has not come
" janata puche ek sawaal, kab tak bajaaoge 'juthi taal'?'' unhone peem modi or bijepi netaaon par kataaksh karte hue sawaal daaga ki kya ye loktantr ke rakshak or javabdehi sunne ke agradoot hai

 Especially after becoming a mother, the excitement about sex life in women decreases

 In such a situation, her tendency towards sex disappears and she stops thinking about it

 Due to heavy rains in the evening in Bhind, Madhya Pradesh, water entered the historic ancient Shiva temple in the heart of the city

 The fame of Vanakandeshwara Temple is spread far and wide and every Monday there is a wave of devotees

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav started his speech along these lines, "what one would guess from the news would make Uttar Pradesh understand something else
" uttar pradesh kaa najariya kuch or he, log kuch or samaj lete hai
 But i thank all of you, i want to express my heartfelt gratitude
 aapaki madad se, aapke sahyog se main yah kah saktaa hum ki log jo samajhate hai, tivi ke madhyam se, 'reel' ke madhyam se, vaisaa uttar pradesh nahin he, doosraa uttar pradesh he
 "the occasion was the UP Investors Meet held on the morning of September 10 at the prestigious Hotel Trident in Mumbai, where Akhilesh Yadav was addressing big businessmen and investors
 matlab saaf tha
 They had realized that the fears of industrialists about UP are stopping their steps to increase investment in the state

 The blurry picture of investment Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's government, which has given the slogan of 'make in UP' on the lines of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'make in India', has yet to go a long way to create an investment climate
 pradesh main nivesh ke liye ab tak 85,000 se adhik ke emoyu sin kiye ja chuke hai lekin 6,800 karod ke project hi hakeekat main utar paae hai

 Along with this, the bad condition of roads, power problems and political interference have also created apprehensions in the minds of investors
 in ashankaon ko todgaye main sapa sarkaar kaa koi gambhir prayaas ab tak saamne nahin aayaa he
 This is the reason why Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Corporation (UPSIDC), which is responsible for industrial development, has been the highest with industrialists in the last three years at Rs 39,000 crore

 However, the biggest apprehension of the banks is about debt recovery and power problem
 dena bank ke siemdi aswani kumaar bataate hai, ''puraane lone kii recovery na hone se upi main bainkon ko ghaataa ho rahaa he
 Apart from this, the lack of electricity and the increasing use of generators have also caused financial losses to banks
 ''bainkon kii samasyaon ko praathamikta ke taur par nistarit karne ke liye ab sarkaar ne nideshak, sansthagat vitt ko nodel adhikari niyukt kiya he
 At the same time, the government has also expected banks to adopt at least two villages in each of their branches

 It is not difficult to understand the debate that has erupted over the inclusion of Piyush Chawla in the World Cup which the Indian team has selected
 do saal se zyada samay tak intjaar karne ke baad 23 varshiya piyush ko vishwa cap ke liye sirf isliye team main chunaa gaya kyonki captain mahendra singh dhoni gendbaaji ke apane hamale main vividhta chaahate the, jabaki is bich duusare gendbaaj jaise leg spinner amit mishra or baayen haath ke spinner pragyan ojha bharat ke test or ekadivasiy maichon kii tiimon ke saath dauron par jate rahe
 Although there is still some time for the World Cup to begin, Chawla's performance in the final match against South Africa at Centurion was nothing special
 phir bhi unhen khabbu gendbaaj ashish nehra par di gai tarjeeh ko karishma hi mana jayega
 For this reason, the debate has intensified with the inclusion of this leg-spinner from Uttar Pradesh in the World Cup squad
 abhi haal main ipiel kii nilaamee main kings ilevan punjab ne piyush chawla par 9,00,000 dollar kii boli lagaakar apni team main banaae rakhaa tha
 The price was equal to Adam Gilchrist's and was $ 100,000 more than Praveen Kumar and Abhishek Nair
 ise dekhte hue chawla ko chune jane par mili-juli raay sunne ko mil rahi he
 Some people are praising it and some people are opposing it
 lekin is vajah se jab yah yuva khilaadi vishwa cap muqablon ke liye maidan main utrega to uske kandhon par baari dabaav hoga
 Yes, Chawla must have been excited to hear that former India captains like Ajit Wadekar and Dilip Vengsarkar welcomed his selection and said that this would give Dhoni another option in his bowling
 lekin kuch log isaki aalochana kar rahe hai
 Bishan Singh Bedi is surprised at the selectors' thinking and calls Chawla's inclusion in the World Cup squad a shock
 unka kahana he, ''mujhe tajjub he ki chayankartaaon ne ek leg spinner ko praathamikta di, jo chest-on ection ke saath gendbaaji karata he, jabaki ojha kii baayen haath kii spin zyada asardaar sabit hoti
 "he recalls," i remember a few years ago at the National Cricket Academy i saw Piyush bowling with Erapalli (prasanna)
 tab mujhe laga tha ki is ladke main gajab kii pratibha he
 But with the passage of time, the edge has been lost in it, which should be in a leg-spinner who wins the match
 ''bedi un logon kii soch se ittfa rakhte hai jinka maananaa he ki unki jagah rohit sharma yaa manish pandey jaise ballebaaj ko team main shaamil karnaa zyada uchit hota
 "that would have given the team management some support if the batting failed," says Bedi
 yuvaraj sachmuch acchhee gendbaaji kar rahe hai or ve aath se das over kii gendbaaji kar sakate hai
 Also, Yusuf Pathan, Suresh Raina, Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag also bowl well, so i would be surprised if two main spinners play together in a match
 ho saktaa he aar
 Both Ashwin and Chawla should remain in the safe players, although Ashwin can be seen as the first choice for the off spin
 agar dhoni or team prabandhan ne sochaa tha ki chawla mahatvapurn yogadan de sakate hai to unhen chawla ko dakshin africa ke daure par har match main avasar dena chahie tha taaki unhen kuch or abhyaas ho jaataa
 '' Chief Selector
 shrikant ne kaha ki unki samiti ko ummid thi ki pichen sukhi hongi jo phiraki gendbaajon ko madad pahunchaayengi
 And Chawla was the most experienced among the other contestants
 dhoni puure vishwaas se chawla kaa bachaav karte hai
 "it is good to include Piyush in the team as they will diversify the attack," he says
 ve ballebaaji bhi kar sakate hai
 If we play with five bowlers, they can bat at number 7 or number 8
 ''pichley do dauron main chawla ne bharat or england main pratham shrenee ke 23 maichon main 36
 1,086 runs were scored at an average of 20
 lekin sawaal yah he ki ekadivasiy or tii-20 maichon main chawla ne aisa kya karnama kar dikhaaya he jisase ve bharat ke pramukh khilaadiyon main gine jaaen? is leg spinner ne bharat ke liye teen tii-20 maichon main sirf do wicket liye hai jabaki 50 over ke 22 maichon main unhone kul 28 wicket liye hai
 His critics say that there is nothing more to be said about him
 chawla ke chayan kii aalochana karne waalon kaa kahana he ki capatoun main dhoni ne jo bayaan diya usase spasht sanket miltaa he ki chawla tabhi 11 khilaadiyon main shaamil kiye jaaenge jab bharat paanch mukhya gendbaajon ke saath maidan main utrega
 India last played against Australia in the Champions Trophy in South Africa in 2009 with five main bowlers
 phir chawla ko chune jane kii duusari vajah kya ho sakati he? bakaul ek purv khilaadi, ve dhoni ke liye bhaagyashaalee khilaadi hai
 According to him, "the captain believes that Chawla was part of the team that won the T20 World Cup in South Africa in 2007
 march, 2008 main bhi kaamanwealth bank siries main australia ke khilaaf do final maichon main ve shaamil the or bharat donon hi match jeet gaya tha
 "chawla's selection may have surprised some, but his real challenge will be in the World Cup matches, when he is tasked with taking the wickets of the opposing team's batsmen with his spin balls
" aligarh main ghar par unhen paras kahkar bulaayaa jaataa he, jise ek aisa pathar mana jaataa he jo kisi bhi cheez ko sona bana detaa he
 Maybe their magic works and with their help the Indian team can make the dreams of one billion Indians come true

 They are working hard in Patiala and Delhi

 ' nursi ioe dwaara mukkebaaji maamalon ke liye gathit tadarth samiti kaa hissaa the

 He was asked to send his supervisor

 ' iske baad sushant se yahi sawaal bhartiya cricket team ke captain viraat kohli or actress kangana ranut ke bare main poocha gaya

 While the US State Department has said that it is closely investigating the report of the use of F-16, the Imran Khan government should be asked questions regarding the terms of self-defense use of F-16 in the High House of Pakistan
 Have been
 bhartiya vayusena ne daawa kiya he ki pakistani vayusena ne 27 farvari ko bhartiya vaayu kshetra kaa ulanghan karte hue epa-16 ladaaku vimaan kaa istemaal kiya or AMRAAM missile se sainya thikaanon ko nishaanaa banaaya
 Air Vice Marshal RGK Kapoor showed fragments of the AMRAAM missile to bolster India's claim which were found in the Indian part
 arjike kapur ne bataaya ki yah missile sirf epa-16 main feet ho saktaa he
 US Paladino, US State Department Deputy Spokesperson Robert Paladino, is investigating the use of the F-16, saying, "we have seen such reports and we are closely following the matter" Are investigating main abhi kuch pusht nahin kar saktaa, lekin ham america raksha takanic sambandhit dweepaksheeya samjhauton ke vishay par saarvajic tippanee nahin karte
 Increasing diplomatic pressure on the previously besieged Pakistan over the issue of terrorism, New Delhi told US officials that using the F-16 against India, Pakistan violated the terms of the deal
 kyonki america ne pakistan ko yah vimaan aatankwaad ke khilaaf yuddh ke liye hi diya tha
 Defense Specialist Air Vice Marshal (rita
 ) kapil kaak kaa kahana he ki america ne pakistan ko epa-16 vimaan aatank ke khilaaf yuddh ke liye die the
 But why is America giving Pakistan air-to-air AMRAAM missiles? Because the terrorists do not have air force

 Rabbani said that there was no India-specific condition attached to this defense deal
 ajeeb baat yah he ki pakistani seenet main epa-16 par bahes ho rahi thi or vahaan ke raksha mantri parvej khatak ko is baat kii jaankaree hi nahin thi ki pakistan or america ke bich hue epa-16 samjhaute main koi shart he yaa nahin
 He said that he would soon inform the House whether there is any such condition or not
 raksha visheshgy kapil kaak kaa kahana he ki deal kii sharten gopneey hoti hai lekin jis vakt yah deal hui thi us samay videshi media ne report kiya tha ki america ne epa-16 vimaan pakistan kii raksha ke liye die hai or inkaa kisi akramanakari karrwai main istemaal galat he
 The thing to note here is that on 27 February, Pakistan not only violated the Indian airspace but also targeted the military bases of India
 kam se kam epa-16 main lagane vaale AMRAAM ke tukade to isaki tasdik karte hi hai

 neshnal eligibility test 22 janvari 2017 ko puure desh main yojit kiya jayega
 Now there is less than two months left for the preparation of this exam
 isliye last samay main revijan karte samay in points ko dhyaan main rakhen
 1
 taiyaari kii samay seemaa ko badaye:net ke exam kaa silebus bada hota he, or ab bahut kam samay batch gaye hai
 In this case, you should make a schedule correctly
 zyaadaatar net pariksha main safal hue students kaa maananaa he ki last samay main shedul banaakar kii gai padhai exam paas karne main zyada madad karti he
 2
 basic chizon par zyada dhyaan den:net exam main bahut saare sawaal us vishay ke basic jaankaree se jude hote hai, isliye basic jaankaree badhayen
 3
 silebus or pattern:exam kii taiyaari main jutane se pehle ek baar silebus zarur dekh len, aisa na ho ki antim samay main aapako pataa chale ki koi topic rah gaya he
 4
 taiyaari kii ek ranneeti banaaen:kam samay main taiyaari karne ke liye ek ranneeti kaa hona bahut jaruri he, aap kuch sawaal khud se taiyaar karen or jawaab dhudhane kii koshish karen
 If you do this daily then your preparation will continue to move in the right direction
 5
 Practice: a proverb in English is Max Man Perfect, yes you can do any work well with practice
 aap apane paas ek clear vijan, time management or kii factors rakhen or use doharaaen
 By doing this you will be able to learn more
 6
 Follow Study Materials: Many times students hurry and buy those books from the market, whose study material is very poor, due to which your preparation can go in the wrong direction
 net kii taiyaari karne ke liye hameshaa soch-samajhakar or salaah lekar hi koi kitaab khariden
 7
 shortnots banaaen:jab aap yah samaj jaaen ki kitna samay kis topic par dena he to uske baad aap un topics ke shortnots bana sakate hai, jisamen kam se kam us vishay ke bare main puri jaankaree mil saken
 8
 revijan:exam se pehle sabase zyada jaruri revijan karnaa hota he, revijan safalataa dilwati he
 a few days before the exam, decide beforehand that these days only and only revision has to be done
 kai sari aisi chijen hoti hai jise aap exam se pehle to pard lete hai, lekin baad main bhul jate hai
 To avoid this mistake, make revision

 sirf itnaa hi nahin, ramgopal yadav ne pair chhukar mulaayam singh yadav kaa manch par swaagat kiya
 This is significant because before the 2017 assembly elections, when leadership struggles were seen between Akhilesh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav, Ram Gopal Yadav was presented as the biggest villain from Shivpal camp in the entire picture
 yahaan tak ki mulaayam singh yadav ne ishaaron-ishaaron main ramgopal yadav ko vivaad ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya
 After this, when Samajwadi Party's 10th National Conference was held in Agra on 5 October 2017 and Akhilesh was crowned as President for 5 years, Mulayam Singh and Shivpal Yadav did not reach there
 jise donon netaaon kii akhilesh yadav ke prati naaraazgi ke taur par dekha gaya
 But now that Shivpal Yadav has officially separated from the SP, elder brother Mulayam Singh is standing with his son Akhilesh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav seems to be alone in this mind

 After the assembly elections of five states, the next challenge before the BJP is to have a President of its choice
 lekin loksabhaa or kai vidhansabhaon main prachand bahumat ke baavjood party ke liye raashtrapati bhawan main apni pasand ke ummidavaar ko pahunchaana aasaan nahin he
 This is the reason why BJP, under the leadership of Amit Shah, is putting a lot of effort for this task
 kya he bijepi kii ranneeti?party ke ranneetikaron ko is baat kaa andaja he ki raashtrapati chunaav main ek-ek vot keemtee hone ja rahaa he
 Therefore, the resignations of Yogi Adityanath and Keshav Prasad Maurya have not been done in the Lok Sabha for the presidential election to be held after two months
 isi tarah manohar parrikar kii rajyasabha sadsyta bhi philhal barkaraar he
 The BJP is also eyeing the by-election of 12 assembly and 3 Lok Sabha seats on 9 April
 amit shah or unki team chaahegi ki bijepi inamen se zyada se zyada siten jiti jaaen taaki raashtrapati chunaav ke liye jaruri voton ke antar ko kam kiya ja sake
 What the points say? Mathematics? In the presidential election, 4120 mlas of legislative assemblies will vote in addition to 776 mps of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
 yani kul 4896 log milakar nayaa raashtrapati chunenge
 The total cost of these votes is 10 according to the process of presidential election
 98 lakh he
 5 to make BJP the President of his choice
 49 lakh keemat ke baraabar voton kii darkaar he
 After the assembly elections of five states, BJP and allies have a total of 5
 53 lakh he
 But about 20 thousand worth of these votes belong to nda's allied parties
 yani jeet kii guarantee ke liye bijepi ko ab bhi 16 hajaar keemat ke vot chahien
 By halting the resignations of Yogi Adityanath, Keshav Prasad Maurya and Parrikar, the BJP has completed a shortfall of 2100 votes
 nau april ko jin siton par up-chunaav hai unke voton kii kul keemat kareeb 4 hajaar baithti he
 This is the reason why the party has special emphasis on these elections
 shivasena bigaad sakati he khelrashtrapati chunaav kii res main bijepi kii chintaa sirf vipakshi partiyon ko lekar nahin he
 It is difficult for the party to trust the Shiv Sena, which has adopted a rebellious attitude
 shivasena kah chuki he ki sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ko raashtrapati ummidavaar banwaaya janaa chahie
 Not only this, in the presidential election, mlas and mps are not tied to any whip
 lihaaja cross voting kii ashanka hameshaa bani rahati he
 The party is also concerned about the vice-presidential election
 sahyogi partiyaan raashtrapati chunaav main samarthan ke badale up-raashtrapati pad ke liye molbhav kar sakati hai
 Obviously, the BJP will not want to compromise on the candidate for the vice-presidential election
 iske liye jaruri he ki wo apane balboote raashtrapati chunaav jeet sake

 However, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha said that the Prime Minister cannot escape responsibility as the head of the Cabinet
 unhone kaha ‘pradhanmantri bhrasht logon se ghire hue hai lekin vah mantrimandal ke pramukh hai isliye apni jimmedaari se batch nahin sakate or vah janata ke prati javabdeh hai
 "congress is breaking its own record in corruption" Sushma said "I asked the Prime Minister a direct question in Parliament but he did not answer
" pradhanmantri ghotaalon ke liye dusron par dosha nahin madh sakate or unhen naitik jimmedaari leni hogi
 The BJP leader alleged that the UPA government is involved in scams on the ground, below ground and on the air
 unhone kaha ‘ek achche khilaadi kii tarah congress bhrashtachar kaa apana hi record tod rahi he or 1
 1 after the 2G scam worth Rs 76 lakh crore
 86 lakh karod rupee kaa koyala ghotaalaa saamne aayaa
 Sushma, who has been criticizing the government for the price rise, said that the UPA government is not only corrupt but is also completely 'insensitive' to the plight of the common man being burdened by inflation
 unhone kaha ki sabsidi vaale silinderon kii sankhya simit kar chah tay karne se boj aam aadmi par hi padegaa
 Criticizing the government's move to allow FDI in FDI in Gherakhudra region, the BJP leader said that the Prime Minister and the UPA government had stabbed the back of the people of the country because the then Finance Minister (now President) Pranab Mukherjee had assured in Parliament that discussions will be held with all parties and Chief Ministers and any decision will be made until consensus is reached
 Do not be

 Now Kishore has also spoken on the issue of National Register of Citizens of India (NRC)
 NDTV ke saath khaas baatcheet main unhone kaha, 'main isaki manshaa ke peeche nahin ja rahaa hum
 In reality, when such laws are implemented, then it is the poor who suffer the most from it
 jaise notebandi, ise lagu karne kaa makasad tha ki jin logon ke paas kalaadhan he, un logon par chot kii jaae
 The rich only have black money
 aakhirkaar kisne isaki keemat chukaai, garib aadmi ne isaki keemat chukaai jiske paas kalaadhan tha bhi nahin
 They had to be in line
 'prashanth kishor ne aage kaha, 'NRC kii baat karen to apni naagarikta sabit karne ke liye har kisi ko apane dastavej dikhaane honge
 Many people will not have documents or will not be able to obtain them
 agar dastavej hai bhi to iske liye logon ko sarkari daftaron ke chakkar lagane honge
 They will be tortured, corruption will increase and many other problems will arise
 20 karod logon ke paas apana ghar nahin he, wo log apni naagarikta kaise sabit karenge
 The JDU Vice President further said, "there should be talk of Aadhaar or Voter ID card for NRC
 yaa to sarkaar aisa kah de ki jinke paas aadhaar or voter card hai wo log bharat ke naagarik hai, lekin wo (sarkaar) aisa nahin kah rahe hai
 This means that for the NRC, we have to show further documents from Aadhaar and Voter cards
 ham aisa kyon kar rahe hai
 Assuming that three percent of the people in the country are living illegally, then you can adopt another method to find them and exclude them, there is no harm in that
 'prashanth kishor ne aage kaha, 'main bharat kaa naagarik hum or mujhe ise sabit karne kii kya jarurat he
 i do not understand this decision of the government
 agar sarkaar desh main NRC lagu karne kaa zikr nahin karti to naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon par charchaa ho sakati he, isamen koi buraai nahin he
 If the government says its combination then it is not acceptable at all
 phir yah na hi dharmik balki vargeey aadhaar par bhi bhedbhaav karata he
 He added, 'my party supported the citizenship law but i opposed it
 samarthan ke bare main party ke mukhiya (nitish kumaar) hi bataa sakate hai
 The party has said many times that the NRC has no need in Bihar and has assured me (nitish Kumar)
 unhone kaha he ki is mudde par party kaa rukh kaayam rahegaa, ise badalane kii koi jarurat nahin or mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki bihar main koi NRC nahin hoga

 In July and August last year, the high-level committee gave funds to Sudhir in two rounds to complete this task

 In view of all these developments, there are some questions that arise in the mind- 1- The time of filing FIR against Tushar was questioning as it was filed after the pressure of arrest of Milind Ekbote and Sambhaji Bhide
 2
 Why did the intelligence agencies not get into the activities of Surendra Gadling, Rona Wilson and Sudhir Dhawale while they were buying arms

 He said that the file which allowed three women officers to fly fighter aircraft came to them in four months
 unhone kaha ki ho saktaa he ki iske peeche bhi mantralay kii purush maansikta ho
 He also said that if male soldiers feel how they will work under women officers then the government can create a separate battalion of women in the army
 unhone yaad dilaayaa ki ye desh jhaansi kii rani or maa durga kaa he
 He said that when he became the defense minister, he thought of doing something about it
 raksha mantri ne bataaya ki jab vayusena pramukh ne unase mahilaon ke ladaaku vimaan udaane kii baat kahi to unhone fouran file mangai
 But it took four months to arrive
 tippaniyan He said why can't women go on a warship? Why not separate facilities can be made there for them

 He reminded that this country belongs to the queen of Jhansi and mother Durga
 unhone kaha ki jab ve raksha mantri bana to is bare main kuch karne kii baat sochi

 paathyakram main shaamil kiya gaya munshi premchand kaa koi ek upanyaas padhakar aap kabhi nahin jaan paaenge ki unhone kis-kis mudde par kya-kya, or kaise likhaa tha
 
 
 Today's era has become an era of reading on mobile and tablet, and the number of enthusiasts reading books on Kindle is increasing, so the readership of Hindi has become a minority
 
 
 meraa aaj bhi maananaa he ki raat ko bistar par jaakar sone se pehle seene par rakhkar kitaab ko padhanaa jo sukun, jo khushi, jo santushti detaa he, vah kindel par nahin mil sakati
 
 
 The different smell of bookbinding of old and new books is still alive today
 
 
 so, aap logon se ab sirf yahi kahana chahta hum, khud bhi kuch na kuch padhane kii aadat daalen, or apane bacchon ko dekhne den ki aap kya kar rahe hai, taaki ve bhi vaise hi ban saken
 
 
 And believe me, if this happens, then Hindi Day celebrated every year will not be needed to improve the condition of Hindi

 a photograph of Narendra Modi appearing alongside noted scientist and former President APJ Abdul Kalam and former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi is becoming increasingly viral

 In the picture being tweeted, it is being said that Narendra Modi used to help the ISRO program since adolescence
 soshal media par is tasviir ko khub tavajjo di ja rahi he
 So was Modi really close to Indira Gandhi? Did Indira include Modi in the space program? 'aaj Tak' conducted a viral test to create a complete horoscope of this black and white picture

 Due to the principle of one person, one post, Pandey will not remain in the post of president for long
 nae adhyaksh ko khojane ke liye bhaajapa (BJP) ko saare aankadon main feet baithne vaala vyakti hi chahie
 Mahendranath Pandey is believed to have played a special role in Uttar Pradesh's big victory
 varsh 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle bhaajapa ne keshav prasad maury ko pradesh adhyaksh banaaya tha or bhaajapa kaa yah prayog bahut safal hua tha
 However, soon after Keshav Prasad became the Deputy Chief Minister, Dr
 Pandey, who was the Minister of State in the Modi government, was given the command of the BJP
 31 agast, 2017 ko adhyaksh pad par asin hue dow pandeya ko brahman sameekaran ko majboot karne kaa avasar diya gaya tha

 The Modi government in its last full budget has given maximum attention to farmers and villages
 ek taraf kisaanon ko karj se ubaarane ke liye 11 lakh karod kaa baari-bharkam prastaav rakhaa gaya he to duusari taraf chote kisaanon kii madad ke liye bhi alag se yojanaayen banaai gai hai
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has made many such provisions in the budget which can strengthen the hands of the government before going to the elections
 bajet main khub yaad aae anndaatadrasal vitt mantri apane bajet main bajet se zyada kisaan shabd kaa istemaal kiya, usase kuch hi kam gaanv shabd kaa istemaal kiya, or utana krishi shabd kaa istemaal kiya
 This budget has made it clear where and why the government is eyeing
 sarkaar abhi tak krishi ke morche par buree tarah naakaam rahi he
 Suicides have increased in many parts of the country
 upaj kaa daam nahin mil rahaa he
 Occasionally, incidents of throwing tomatoes, sometimes potatoes and other vegetables have been reported
 in tasveeron ke bainks sarkaar ke samamne apni chintaaon kii ujali chhavi saamne rakhane kaa ye aakhri mauka tha
 And the government did not lose it
 apane aakhri bajet main sarkaar ne kisi ko khush karne kii koshish kii he to wo hai kisaan, or iske liye sarkaar ne dil se lekar khajaane tak kaa darwaja khol diya he
 14 to improve the condition of villages
 5 lakh karod kaa praavdhaan kiya he
 Out of this, 11 lakh crores were used to give loans to farmers
 - kisaan credit card ke daayre main ab pashupalkon ko bhi laayaa jayega
 - 42 mega food parks will be built for the farmers to use their produce
 - aalu-pyaaj kii paidaavaar badhaane ke liye 500 karod kaa oparation green fund
 - 2 crore new toilets will be provided to poor families
 - gaanvon main internet ke vikaas ke liye 10 hajaar karod kaa praavdhaan hoga
 - By 2022, the old promise to give home to every poor has been repeated
 sarkaar ne is aas main faisla kiya he ki chunaav main jane se pehle kisaanon par hui ye barish uske satta main lautne kii ummiido ko bhi buland kar degi
 Apart from this, the target of providing free gas connections under the Ujjwala scheme has been increased from 5 crore to 8 crore
 5 lakh nae praathmik swasthya centre kholane kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 86 percent has been announced to create a separate structure for the purchase of small farmers' produce
 kya kisaanon ke badalenge din?bajet ke baad pradhanmantri ne kaha ki kisaanon kii haalat sudhaare bagaiyr desh ko sahi disha main nahin le jaaya ja saktaa he or iske liye bajet main dil kholkar praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 So the story is that the farmer can be happy with this budget
 lekin mushkil ye he ki sarkaar kii zyaadaatar yojanaayen lambii avidhi kii he, or jabatak iskaa phayda unhen samaj main aayega tabatak chunaav aa jaaenge
 For the farmers in the budget, the government has not only done so much for the farmers, it has made the entire budget in such a way that every farmer feels good
 noujvaan kisaan ko wifai milegaa, bade kisaan ko foodpark milegaa to chote kisaanon ko vaazib daam kaa vaada
 Do not know how much the farmers will be happy with these promises, but the government has described it as revolutionary
 gauratlab he ki bajet se sabase zyada ummid thi bhi kisaanon ko hi
 He is also most angry with the government, because most of the promises with which the Modi government came to power in 2014 are incomplete
 isliye ye bajet uske liye bhul sudhaar kii tarah dekha ja rahaa tha
 Now that the government has made reforms on its behalf, questions are arising whether farmers' condition will also be improved with this improvement in a year

 maharashtra- haryana vidhansabha chunaav par votingjane- cas hote hai agsit pole, kitne hote hai sahimaharashtra or haryana vidhansabha chunaav ke liye ek charan main somvaar ko voting ho rahi he
 The voting process will be completed by 6 pm
 aise main sabhi chunaav surveykshan agenciyon or samachar channelon ke nateezon se jude agsit pole saamne aaenge
 Do you know what exit polls are? Also, how are the post poll and opinion poll conducted
 aaie aapako bataate hai
 What are exit polls? First, let's talk about exit polls
 ise jari karne ke liye pehle data colect kiya jaataa he
 This data collection is also done on the day of voting
 aakhri phej kii voting ke din jab matadaata vot daalkar nikal rahaa hota he tab usase poocha jaataa he ki kise vot diya
 The results drawn from the survey conducted on this basis are called exit polls
 aamtaur par tivi channel voting ke aakhri din agsit pole hi dikhaate hai
 Let me tell you, the results of exit poll are always released on the last day of voting
 kya hote hai post pole?agsit pole se post pole ke parinaam zyada sateek maane jate hai
 In the exit poll, the survey agency calculates who is winning and who is losing immediately after voting
 vahiin post pole hameshaa matdaan ke agle din yaa phir ek-do din baad hote hai
 In this, the decision is not taken in haste
 jaise maan lijie aaj maharashtra or haryana vidhansabha kii voting hui he to post pole survey karne vaali agency 22, 23 or 24 oktober tak is charan main vot dene vaale matadaataaon se unki raay jaanane kii koshish kare, to ise post pole kaha jayega
 Why are post polls more accurate? Exit polls are considered to be decided in a hurry
 aise main ye jaruri nahin ki ye puri tarah se sahi hon
 In the exit poll, voters try to find their opinion immediately after voting
 bataa den, survey karne vaale poling booth ke baahar hi aisa survey karne karte hai
 In such a situation, the voters hide their identity and express their opinion in haste
 jis vajah se jo survey aata he wo galat bhi ho saktaa he
 At the same time, in the post poll, after a day or two, after trying to talk to the voter, his mind is trying to find which candidate he has voted for
 is dauraan vah kisi kanfusion main nahin hota he or lagbhag sahi-sahi raay bataa detaa he
 What is Opinion Polopinian Polls are different from exit polls

 bahes kii shuruuaat karte hue solicytor general (SG) ne kaha ki nideshak hone ke baad bhi vyakti akhil bhartiya seva kaa hissaa hota he
 Chief Justice Ranjag Gogoi asked what was the difficulty in getting the selection committee's advice before the CBI director withdrew his powers? The Supreme Court has reserved its decision in this case
 bahes ke dauraan justise keem joseph ne kaha ki niyam ke anusaar sibiai diarector ko do saal tak ke liye pad par bane rahanaa chahie
 Justice Joseph asked senior advocate Dushyant Dave to read about the CVC Act which deals with the removal of the commissioner but never the removal of the CBI director
 darasal, dave daleel de rahe hai ki sivisi ko sibiai kii jaanch karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 He said that the Central Government has not taken care of the autonomy of the CBI in this matter
 
 
 
 When Kapil Sibal, on behalf of Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge, laughed in the court room, said that the CBI deals not only with corruption but also Aarushi and murder
 isi dauraan chif justise ranjan gogoi ne unhen bich main rokte hue kaha ki or wo maamle bhi jo sibiai ko ham dete hai
 During this, there was a loud noise in the court
 guuruuvaar ko bahes kii shuruuaat karte hue SG tushaar mehta ne kaha ki akhil bhartiya sevaayen ke sadasyon ke maamle kaa nipataara sivisi act, 2003 kii dhara 8(2) ke tahat hota he
 The question is that after becoming the director of CBI, does anyone remain a member of All India Services? It is not written in the Police Act that a person who has the qualification to become a director is exempted from the rules applicable to the police service
 jiske jawaab main sijeai ranjan gogoi ne kaha ki alok verma kii daleel yah he ki unke adhikaar waapas lene sambandhi koi bhi karrwai vinith narayan jajment ke vipareet he or aisa karne ke liye sellection cameti kii sweekruti kii aavashyaktaa he
 The CJI told Tusshar Mehta that what was the difficulty in getting the selection committee's advice before the CBI director withdrew his powers? In response, SG said that it was not a transfer case
 tab sijeai ne kaha ki phir bhi sellection cameti kii salaah lene main kya kathinaayee thi?sg tushaar mehta ne kaha ki nideshak akhil bhartiya seva kaa sadsy hota he
 To which CJI said of course
 tushaar mehta ne kaha ki maan lijie koi adhikari ghoose letaa hua camere par pakadaa jaataa he or use fouran nilambit karnaa he, tab aisi sthiti main iskaa adhikaar centre sarkaar ke paas he
 Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said that instead of investigating serious cases, the two officers were investigating each other
 sivisi sansad ke prati javabdeh hai
 On which CJI Gogoi asked whether the CVC investigation in the CBI case could go beyond the anti-corruption law
 tab tushaar mehta ne cabinet secretary kii sivisi ko july main bheji gai shikaayat kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki sivisi kii karrwai achaanak nahin hui yah maamla pehle se chal rahaa tha
 Attorney General KK Venugopal said that we did not go before the High Level Committee because it was not a transfer case
 yadi ham cameti ke samaksh jate to wo kahati ki yah maamla hamaare saamne kyo rakhaa ja rahaa he? yah yachikakarta kaa banaavati tark he ki yah maamla transfar se judaa he
 Venugapal said that CVC holds meetings with CBI every month
 kyonki sivisi ko lagaataar adhikariyon ke khilaaf shikaayatein milti rahati hai
 Hence this action was appropriate to deal with this unexpected situation
additional Solicitor General PS Narasimha, sibiai kii taraf se pesh hote hue adishnal solicytor general pies narsimha ne kaha ki samay purv kisi adhikari kaa tabadla cameti kii sifarish ke baad hi ho saktaa he
 However, this rule is limited to transfers
 vishesh nideshak rakesh asthana kii taraf se daleel dete hue varisht adhivaktaa mukul rohtagi ne kaha ki centre sarkaar ke paas- niyukti, transfar, 2 saal ke nunatam kaarykaal ko chhodkar-nilamban, vibhageeya jaanch or barkhaastagi kaa adhikaar he
 The CJI asked Rohatgi not to argue like Asthana's lawyer
 sibiai nideshak alok verma kii taraf se varisht adhivaktaa phali nariman ne kaha ki kisi bhi paristhiti main unhen samiti kii salaah leni chahie
 In this case, transfer does not mean transfer to the jurisdiction of service
 tabadale kaa matlab sirf ek sthaan ke duusare sthaan par sthanantaran nahin hota
 According to the central government order, Verma's rights have been withdrawn
 sivisi ke aadeshaanusaar bhrashtachar ke maamle main jaanch se dur rakhaa gaya
 Denial of right to work is also a transfer
 sibiai nideshak kii jimmedaari antarim nideshak ko transfar kar diya gaya he
 This is also a transfer
 nariman ne kaha ki mudda pad par bane rahanaa nahin he, offis main bane rahanaa he
 Earlier on Wednesday, the Center said in the court that the fight between the two top level CBI officers was going public, tarnishing the image of the country's premier investigative agency
 isi vajah ke centre ko sibiai kii saakh bachaane ke liye dakhal dena padaa
 Significantly, CBI Director Alok Verma has challenged the decision of the Center to be sent on leave in the Supreme Court
 court main alok verma kii daleel he ki unhen hataane se pehle niyam kaa paalan nahin kiya gaya, kyonki sibiai ke nideshak ko hataane kaa faisla ek cameti karti he
 But no such committee was consulted about them
 vahiin, maamle main centre kii daleel he ki alok verma ke khilaaf vishesh nideshak rakesh asthana ne sivisi ke samaksh shikaayat thi or sivisi kii sifarish ke aadhaar par unhen chuttee par bheja gaya
 At the same time, on Wednesday, Attorney General KK Venugopal told the Supreme that the fight between two top CBI officers Alok Verma and Rakesh Asthana had become public
 jisase pramukh jaanch agency kii chhavi kharaab ho rahi thi, jise lekar logon kaa bharosa kam ho rahaa tha
 Venugopal said that the central government and the CVC had to decide who is right and who is wrong? For this reason, the Center had to intervene on the recommendation of the CVC and send the two top officials on leave to complete the investigation
 unhone court ko bataaya ki alok verma ko hataaya nahin gaya, balki chuttee par bheja gaya
 What's the matter? Let us tell you that on 23 October the Center appointed Joint Director m Nageswara Rao as Interim Director after two top CBI officers got involved in a bribery dispute
 isi ke saath jaanch puri hone tak nideshak alok verma or vishesh nideshak rakesh asthana ko chuttee par bhejne ke saath kuch anya adhikariyon kaa tabadalaa kar diya gaya tha
 In fact, a DSP of Rakesh Asthana and his team is accused of taking bribe to crack businessman Satish Sana's case in the investigation of meat trader Moin Qureshi
 vahiin, asthana kaa aarope he ki rishwat unhone nahin balki alok verma ne lee thi

 The new line of Delhi Metro i
e
 Magenta Line is going to be started, which will run between Janakpuri West and Botanical Garden of Noida
 haalanki shuruaati daur main metro kalkaji mandir se botanical garden ke bich shuru kii jaaegi
 The metro is ready in this part
 sabhi testing bhi puri kar lee gai hai or ab final manjuuri ke liye kaagazat metro rail sefti kamishnar ke paas bhej die gaye hai
 After this CMRS will inspect this line and then after getting the green signal the Metro line will be opened for the people
 chaliye ab aapako bataate hai ki is nai line kii kya khubi or khaasiyat rahane vaali he? sabase pehle baat train kii
 
 
 The color code of this line will be Magenta and all Metro trains will have Magenta color stripe
 khaas baat yah he ki ye duniya kii sabase behtareen or advance takneekee vaali train hogi
 This train will be equipped with UTO i
e
 Unattended Train Operation Technique means that they can be run without driver also
 haalanki dmarsi shuruaati ek saal ke liye train ko driver ke saath chalaaegi
 The second biggest feature will be that it can run back-to-back trains and the train can run at a frequency of ninety seconds
 isse zyada se zyada yatrimetroki yatra kar sakenge
 Metro Double Door System: All stations on this metro line will have a double door system between the platform and the train
 iske liye platform screen door lagaae gaye hai
 By doing this, the train operation will be easier and the incidents of suicide at metrostations will be stopped
 ye platform screen door metro ke platform par rukne ke baad hi khulenge or train ke ravaanaa hone ke saath hi band ho jaaenge
 According to the Metro officials, this will also prevent incidents of train doors not being closed due to congestion
 blue line or woilet line ke bich milegi interchange kii suvidhakalkaji mandir se botanical garden ke bich magenta line khulne se do steshnon par interchange kii suvidha milegi
 This will make the journey between Noida and Faridabad easier and will not have to travel much
 kyonki kalkaji mandir stesan par faridabad se aa rahe log sidhe noida ke liye botanical garden vaali train le sakate hai
 Till now, he had to go to Mandi House and change the train for Noida
 isi tarah noida se kalkaji jane waalon ko bhi mandi house se train badalakar khan market lajpat nagar ghoomte hue pahunchate the, lekin ab sidhe botanical garden se train mil sakati he
 This will reduce the travel time by half
 dilli sarkaar ne apane bajet main koi nayaa tex bhaar aam aadmi par nahin daalaa
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has described the budget of his government as beneficial for the poor and middle class
 kejariwal ne ajtak se baat karte hue kaha ki koi nayaa tex nahin laayaa gaya he jo ki bahut acchhee baat he
 Model not ready on wi-fi The Chief Minister made it clear that no announcement has been made in the budget intentionally on wi-fi
 unhone kaha ki ab tak vaai-faai par koi model ham tay nahin kar paae hai
 Kejriwal said that we do not want to make any hurry in realizing the dream of wi-fi
 lihaaja dilli ko muft vaai-faai jarur milegaa lekin uske liye thodaa intjaar karnaa hoga
 Health and education priority: Kejriwal said that education for children and health for all has always been the priority of his government
 dilli main sarkari skulon kii dasha main amulchul parivartan aayaa he
 Medicines are also available free in hospitals

 Wrong to say election budget, Kejriwal said that his government is doing good work for Delhi and an effort has been made in the budget to pursue the same work
 isliye ise ellection kaa bajet kahana thik nahin he
 Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is said to be upset with the news that Rahul Gandhi is angry with him because Gehlot took all his attention to win son Vaibhav Gehlot in Jodhpur and did not pay much attention to campaigning for other candidates
 unhone yah to mana ki party ke pradarshan par alaakaman kii naaraazgi jaij he lekin yah bhi kaha ki ''rahul ne jo kaha vahi media main report nahin hua, ardhd-satya ko prachaarit karnaa aniatik he
 Gehlot's response suggests that he is in a mood to confront his rivals, especially Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot
 yahaan tak ki unhone payalat se vaibhav kii haar kii samiksha karne ko kaha
 Gehlot said that it was Pilot who recommended Vaibhav's candidature and guaranteed victory
 haalanki payalat ne mukhyamantri ke bayaan par hairaani jataai
 Experts believe that the two will settle between them and Gehlot may demand from the high command to free him from one of the two posts
 philhal gahalot ke party main pratidwandvi un par aakraamak ho rahe hai or vipakshi bhaajapa ne aag main ghi daalane main koi kami nahin chodi he
 Gehlot supporters hold the pilot responsible for this
 yahi nahin, ek mantri ne istipha de diya (jise gahalot ne naamanzoor kar diya), do ne aatmamanthan kii baat kahi or congress vidhayak harish meena, jo unke duusare kaarykaal ke adhikansh samay main rajya ke dijipi rahe the, do din tak anshan par baith gaye
 Meena is demanding a job for the relatives of a tractor driver involved in illegal sand mining, who died during a police chase at the Municipal Fort in Tonk district
 paryaton mantri vishvendra singh bhi dharne par baith gaye or apane grih nagar bharatpur main police adhikariyon par bade paimaane par bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaate hue kai police adhikariyon kaa tabadalaa kara diya
 There may be an atmosphere against Gehlot right now, but he has overcome such situations many times before and has defeated the rivals
 mukhyamantri ke rup main yah unka teesraa kaarykaal he
 The Lok Sabha election is also over
 chunaav jeetne main naakaami ke baavjood gahalot ko apni vafadari or rajnatik kaushal ke kaaran nehru-gandhi parivaar kaa vishwaas hasil he
 Gehlot is also reaching out to his most outspoken critics, indicating that he has changed his stance, contrary to his old instincts
 unhone apane puraane kaarykaal kii kukhyat mandali ko alag-thalag kar diya he or lagaataar media ke har tarah ke sawaalon kaa saamana khud kar rahe hai
 He also showed socialist tendencies
 jaipur main 27 may ko police diwas par adhikariyon ko sambodhit karne ke liye saamaajik kaaryakarta aruna roy ko aamantrit kiya or 2 june ko bhilwara jile main unke majdoor kisaan shakti sanghathan sammelan main bhaag lene pahunche
 Gehlot has also continued his administrative agenda
 i-cigarette or kralevar vaale hukke kii bikri par pratibandh laga diya gaya he or tambaakoo or sharaab ke khilaaf ve ek rashtriya niti kii vakaalat kar rahe hai
 He is pushing for the concept of providing free generic medicines in government hospitals launched during his second term, and promoting affordable health services
 mukhyamantri kuch madhya-shrenee ke kushal adhikariyon kii madad se saarvajanik vitaran pranali ko behatar banane par dhyaan kendrit kar rahe hai
 Gehlot has also shown his intention to break the nexus of the police, mining officials, contractors and local leaders, who have mined millions in violation of the mining ban orders of the Supreme Court
 jaise hi unhen alvar main ek yuva dalit mahila se gangrape ke aropiyon ke khilaaf karrwai main deree kii soochna mili, unhone karrwai kii
 He has also sought reports of all rape and police atrocities in the state and has introduced some new changes like allowing district police chiefs to file firs in his office for crimes like rape
 andruni sutron kaa kahana he ki unka aglaa dhyaan dhanchaagat vikaas par hoga haalanki krishi rin maafee or anya chunavi ghoshnaaon ke kaaran rajya kii vittiya sthiti charmarai hui he
 This does not mean that everything from Gehlot's pilot to Adavat has become normal
 gahalot ke dhairya rakhane or shanti se kaam karne ke tareeke kaam aate rahe hai lekin yuva payalat ke tarkash main bhi kai tir hai
 *** litegharko sundar or aakarshak banane main sabase ahm bhoomika nibhaati he
 Beautiful lights are most special in creating a peaceful atmosphere in the house
 saath hi samajhadaari se lagaai gai lite bijli or paisa donon bachaati he, isliye jaruri he ki lite lagane ke pehle kuch baton kaa vishesh dhyaan rakhaa jaae
 Just as people want such an atmosphere in the office, where work can be done by meditating, in the same way people in the house desire peace and comfort

 Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni had to change his fielding when he hit two fours with a reverse sweep

 Much of the credit for India's success in this Test goes to him, but Kohli also scored an excellent century

 He said, 'both teams needed to focus on certain aspects
 bhartiya team main bhi kuch kamajoriyaan hai jin par ham puraa kaam nahin kar sake
 If we could have given them a target of 150 or 200 runs, then we would have known how they are playing on the falling wicket
 ’unhone is baat kaa koi jawaab nahin diya ki duusare test main australia do spinneron ko lekar utrega yaa nahin
 He said, 'even before this test we had the same options
 hamen hyderabad main halaat kaa akalan karnaa hoga

 Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi has taunted Lalu after the Enforcement Directorate's attachment proceedings in the case of acquiring benami property and the RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav and his family's 3-acre land of 45 crore in Patna in the railway tender scam 
 susheel modi ne kaha ki jab unhone lalu kii is benami sampatti kaa khulaasa kiya tha to lalu ne sawaal uthaaya tha ki aakhir kahaan is cese ke silsile main unke thikaanon par chhapemari hui he?unhone kaha ki jaanch agenciyon dwaara chhapemari kii jagah or thikaanon ke saarvajanik hone ke baad lalu kii daleel yah thi ki kya koi exiaar darj hui he
 When the FIR was registered, due to fear, Laloo and family went to inquire and sheared
 modi ne kaha ki giraftaar ke dar se lalu or unke parivaar vaale jaanch agenciyon ke saamne pesh hue the
 He said that Laloo Prasad and Tejashwi Yadav are asking why the charge sheet has not been filed after the ED seized 3 acres of the Lara project
 Modi said that the ED, IT, CBI have so much strong evidence against the Lalu family that not only will the charge sheet be filed but everyone will also have to go to jail and be punished
 darasal purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne sawaal poocha tha ki aakhir sampatti kurki ke baad chargeshit daayar kyon nahin hui he
 Responding to this, Modi said that instead of waiting for the filing of the chargesheet, Tejashwi Yadav should tell that at the age of 28, the 3-acre land on which the biggest mall of 750 crore was being built in Bihar at the age of 28 years How did he become the owner? Sushil Modi said, the truth is that when Laloo Prasadrahel was the minister, he bought the land of Prem Chandra Gupta's company from the Kochar brothers in lieu of two hotels in the railway
 It was written in the name of marketing and after that the capital and entire company was acquired in the name of Rabri Devi and Tejashwi Yadav by applying capital of only four lakh rupees
 lalu prasad jab tak sari benami sampatti jaanch agenciyon ke saamne sarender karte hue apane ghotaalon kaa praayshchit kar janata se maafee nahin maangate, tab tak keval maansaahaar chhodane se unke sankat dur hone vaale nahin hai
