 In the first half, Sigurdsson of Iceland created two good chances, but his efforts were thwarted by Francis Ujoho on both occasions
 nigeria ne pehle chah minute main sigurdson ke in hamalon ke baad satarkta barti or gend ko apane kabje main rakhane par dhyaan diya
 Nigeria was also largely successful in this, but it remained confined to the middle of the field and did not make any dangerous moves
 is bich iceland ne jarur aakraamak tevar dikhaae, lekin vah gol karne main naakaam rahaa
 Both Sigurdsson and John Bodvarsson missed in the first half's injury time and thus the score remained goalless until midnight

 The bugle of the general election 2019 has been blown
 chunaav tarikhon ke elaan ke saath hi desh main aachaar samhita lagu ho gai he or nai sarkaar kaa countdown jari he
 This election is going to be very special, on one hand the Bharatiya Janata Party under Narendra Modi is trying to come back to power
 to vahiin congress rahul gandhi ke netritv main satta main waapas aane kii koshish karegi
 There are many issues before the Lok Sabha elections, on which the Opposition and Opposition are face-to-face and who can decide the direction of the Lok Sabha elections
 iske alaava bhaajapa-congress ke saamne kai aisi chunautiyaan bhi hai, jinka saamana unhen aane vaale 70 dinon main karnaa he
 What are the biggest issues 1
 rashtriya suraksha kaa mudda charam parpulawama aatanki hamale ke baad rashtriya suraksha kaa mudda charam par he
 On one hand BJP is saying that they have given a befitting reply to Pakistan and during their tenure there have been surgical strikes and airstrikes once
 to vahiin congress bhi is mudde par hamalavar he or modi sarkaar par rafel deal main ghotaale kaa aarope laga rahi he
 The Congress alleges that the Modi government benefited its allies by keeping national security in check
 2
 Who with Annadata? The Modi government came to power with the promise of doubling farmers' income by 2022, and announced the package to farmers just before the election
 nai yojana ke tahat chote kisaanon ke khate main salanaa 6000 rupee die ja rahe hai, jisko lekar bijepi dam thok rahi he
 At the same time, the Congress is also continuously raising the issue of farmers 'plight and alleging that in the last 5 years, there has been an increase in farmers' suicide
 3
 This time, rares on employment! The BJP is moving forward on the issue of economy by putting the issue of GST and demonetisation on the front foot, while the Congress party is besieging Prime Minister Narendra Modi on employment figures
 congress kaa aarope he ki bijepi ne jo har saal 2 karod rojgaar dene kaa vaada kiya tha, usamen vah fail rahi he
 4
 parivaarwaad banaam yojanaon kii naakaami!parivaarwaad ke mudde ko lekar bijepi beete kaaphi samay se congress ko gherti ai he, phir chaahe rahul gandhi kaa adhyaksh bananaa ho yaa phir haal hi main priyanka gandhi wadra kii raajnneeti main entry
 Every time the Congress has been targeted by the BJP
 to vahiin congress bhi sarkaar ko unki yojanaon kii naakaamiyon par gherne main juty he, isamen sabase bada mudda mek in india kaa he
 Apart from this, targeting is going on for farmers, dalits, women safety etc
 5
 Caste rained! Congress is continuously alleging that atrocities on Dalits have increased under the Modi government
 phir chaahe vah oona kii ghatana ho yaa phir rohit vemula kaa maamla he, pichley saal 2 april ko bharat band ke dauraan hui hinsa bhi shaamil he
 So at the same time, the reservation given by the BJP on economic grounds is also being suppressed, the BJP is confident that with this bet their upper caste voters will vote in their favor
 6
 Who will build the temple? The Ram temple issue has been an issue of every election since 1990, although this time the matter is in the Supreme Court and has moved towards arbitration

 You too have often heard people say that if you want to bring glow to your face then apply ice
 ho saktaa he aapane kuch logon ko aisa karte hue dekha bhi ho
 Few people will know that by applying ice on the face, the dark circles go away and the face always remains fresh
 agar aapako bahut adhik mechap lagaana pasand nahin he to aapako niyamit rup se barf kaa istemaal karnaa chahie
 By doing this, the face is always fresh

 Do not apply ice in one place only
 barf ko puure chehre par ghumana jaruri he
 Also, neck it
 haalanki barf ko applai karne ke dauraan is baat kaa dhyaan hameshaa rakhen ki aapaki twachaa sidhe barf ke sampark main na aae
 If this happens, the skin may turn red due to too much cold
 ek mulaayam kapade main barf ko lapet len
 One more important thing, if you have to go for a long time and you want your makeup to last longer, then apply ice before makeup
 barf applai karne ke baad chehre ko mulaayam kapade se sukha len or iske baad mechap lagaaein
 Such makeup remains for a long time
 chehre par barf lagane se cheharaa saumy or sheethal bana rahata he
 It also gives relief in sunburn
 agar aap tanning kii samasya se jujh rahe hai to bhi ye ek kargar upaay ho saktaa he
 It would be beneficial to do this once a day
 agar aapako threading karaane main bahut dard hota he to bhi aap barf kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 Rub ice over and around eyebrows before threading
 pani ko halke se saaf karne ke baad threading karaaen
 You will have much less pain than before
 saath hi threading yaa vexing karaane ke baad laal pad chuki twachaa par bhi barf malana phydemand hota he
 For the glowing face, applying ice on the face increases blood circulation, which causes the face to glow
 saath hi ye rinkal or badhati umr ke nishaan kam karne main bhi madadgaar hota he
 If you want better results, then put fruit juice in an ice cube tray and then apply it on the face
 dark sarkal ke lieankhon ke neeche ke kaale gheron ko dur karne ke liye tarah-tarah ke utpaada bazaar main maujuud hai
 But if you want, you can use ice
 ye kargar hone ke saath hi surakshit bhi hai
 If you want better results, you can store cucumber juice and rose water in ice cube tray
 iske istemaal se dark sarkal kii samasya bahut jaldi dur ho jaaegi
 To remove pimples, you can apply snow on the face as soon as red marks appear on the face
 agar aapako or behatar parinaam chahie to aap neem yaa pudine kii pattiyon ko ubalkar us pani ko aais kyub trey main daalkar jamaa sakate hai
 This will not increase pimples and will also clear the face
 bedaag twachaa ke lieis facial twachaa ko na keval glo detaa he balki bedaag bhi banaata he
 It is very easy and effective

 '' Bollywood is like a family to me
 ek aisa parivaar jisamen noujvaan bachche hote hai, mata-pita hote hai or ghar ke bujurg bhi hote hai
 Everyone has their own importance
 jis tarah ghar main noujvaan bacchon ke aane se nai urja yaa raunak aa jaati he, vaisaa hi alam in dinon bollywood main bhi he
 The way every generation brings its own tone
 vaisaa hi is peedi ke saath bhi he
 This new generation is the product of the second decade of the 21st century
 is peedi kaa andaja mujhe apane ghar main hi lag jaataa he
 Now take Aaliya only
 vah 21 saal kii he or usne apni teen filmon ke saath vah sab kuch kar diya he, jo main pichley 40 saal main nahin kar sakaa
 The arrival of the new generation does not end the importance of the old
 har daur main aisa samay aata he
 Superstars of all times have to hand over their crowns to the new generation
 yah vakt kaa takaza he or uski jarurat bhi
 Along with this, the demand of audience also, because with changing audiences the choice of stars also changes
 lekin koi bhi sitara aprancegik nahin ho jaataa
 For example, Amitabh Bachchan is still working
 shahrukh, salmaan, aamir, ajay devgan, akshay kumaar, imran hashmi, siddharth malhotra or varun dhawan bhi filmein de rahe hai or ye sab ek saath chal rahe hai
 The arrival of a new generation does not end the old
 vakt aawaaj uthaata he or kuch badlaav ho jate hai
 When new and old generations are compared, it often comes to my mind that the present generation is very professional and serious about work
 maine is peedi kaa viraat swaroop dekha he
 They know much more at a young age, they are far ahead of their older generation
 unamem apane kaam kii samaj he, acting bhi jaanate hai or uske saath hi bijness model kii bhi ve gahari samaj rakhte hai
 The people of our generation were somewhat incomplete in this matter
 yah sab macurity kaa nateeja he kyonki jab samaaj maior hota he, to uskaa asar us peedi par bhi dikhataa he
 Simply, the same maturity has an effect on new children
 yahi vah vajah he, jo inke saath kaam karne ko aasaan banaati he
 Being superior in terms of understanding, many tasks are handled easily, whereas in my time i have faced many problems
 khan tikdi, ajay devgan or anya sitare lagbhag dhai dashak se anterten kar rahe hai, lekin yah daur bahut mushkil he
 People do not remember today's headlines till tomorrow
 duniya kshan-kshan badal rahi he
 In such a situation, they have to stick, play long innings like their older generation, then they have to roll in different ways and avoid getting caught in some typecast because it is not easy to do good work for 10-20 years
 dekhnaa yah he ki is nai peedi main itani urja or madda he ki yah is tarah kii kamyaabi doharaa paaegi

 abdul kalam ke daftar main unhen yah bataane ke liye phone kiya tha ki main dobaaraa india today main aa gaya hum or ham ek conklev kii yojana bana rahe hai jahaan unka sambodhan chaahate hai
 Kalam promised that he would meet me this week
 afsos, aisa na ho sakaa
 i know that he would greet me with his naughty smile and say, "what, have you changed your configuration again!" i had the privilege of writing a lot about his life
 aisa karte samay kalam ke bare main mujhe sabase chaunkaane vaali baat yah lagi ki ve hameshaa pratikul halaat main bhi sakaaratmak paksh dhund lete the
 Kalam was born in a Muslim family in the temple town of Rameswaram, where his father was a Manjhi and had to face a lot of bigotry
 skool main jab ve ek brahman ladke kii bagal main baithe to unke shikshak ne naaraaz hokar unhen kaksha se baahar kar diya
 When i asked Kalam about his feeling, he only remembered good things
 yah bataate hue unki ankhen nam ho gayi ki kaise gaanv ke hi ek anya brahman ne yah ghatana suni to usne unako apane ghar khaane par bulaayaa or apni sankochi patni ko unhen khaanaa parosane kaa aadesh diya
 When his boat was destroyed in a storm, his sister pledged her jewels and sent him to Madras Institute of Technology to study for a diploma in engineering

 Pandalai recalls that although there were no direct signs of Kalam being the best, he still wanted to overcome any obstacle for what he wanted to achieve
 '' kalam behad mehnatee the
 Qualities such as clean gooey, resolve, hard work and humility helped him to make the impossible possible
 kalam ne mujhe bataaya tha ki unki ichha ladaaku payalat banane kii thi or vaayu sena ke saakshaatkaar main naakaam rahane par ve kaaphi niraash hue the
 Only then did they decide what happened if they could not fly, they would make flying machines
 unki bhartee junior vaigyanik ke rup main hui
 He was then replaced by the Aeronautical Development Division in Bangalore
 unhone apane dam par swadeshi hovercraft kaa praaroop taiyaar kiya or use dekhakar jo log prabhavit hue, unamem em

 Menon was also there
 unhone vikram sarabhai se kalam kii sifarish kii jo us samay bharat ke antariksh kaarykram kii yojana bana rahe the
 Kalam soon became Sarabhai's favorite by successfully helping build and launch India's first rocket
 sarabhai ke uttaradhikari satish dhawan ne haalanki ek team prabandhak ke bataur kalam kii kshamtaaon ko nikharaa or unhen bharat ke pehle upgrah prakshepan vaahan eselvi3 kaa pariyojna nideshak bana diya
 Many of his colleagues who received doctorate from abroad felt bad that the diploma holder in engineering has been placed on them
 unhone kalam main hinata bodh bharne kii bharsak koshish kii, lekin yuva kalam ko itani aasaani se nicha dikhaanaa sambhav nahin tha
 Kalam told me that he saw the years here as his turning days and that the best teachers were available to guide him
 sarabhai se unhone siikhaa ki drushti kii ahmiyat kya hoti he
 From Dhawan he learned how vision is transformed into missions and how flawless systems are developed
 spes centre ke pehle nideshak mridubhashi brahmaprakash se unhone siikhaa ki kisi mishan ko hasil kiye jane yogya lakshyon main kaise tabdeel kiya ja saktaa he
 All these combined made Kalam a brilliant manager of technology, which was rare
 ahm baat yah thi ki kalam ke guruon ne unhen yah sikhaaya ki naakaamiyon se kaise nibata jaae
 The SLV 3 was first launched in 1979 and fell into the Bay of Bengal
 dhawan ne isaki jimmedaari apane kandhon par le lee
 Saved Kalam who wanted to resign
 phir dhawan ne kalam ko sikhaaya ki kathor gunvattta niyantran pranali ko kaise sunishchit kiya jaae
 SLV 3 was successfully launched a year later, making India the sixth nation in terms of satellite launch
 dhawan chupchaap peeche hat gaye or unhone kalam ko iskaa shrey jane diya
 Kalam said that he felt restless after the launch
 ve nai chunautiyaan puri karnaa chaahate the
 Nuclear scientist Raja Ramanna, the scientific adviser to the then defense minister, was looking for someone who could make a living in the moribund Defense Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL) and make missiles to carry nuclear weapons
 unhen jab pataa chalaa ki kalam kisi nae kaam kii khoj main hai, to unhone is prayogshaala kii kaman unhen dene ke liye apni sari takat jhonk di
 This was the first time that the top space scientist was commanding a defense project
 maine kalam se poocha ki jab ve antariksh kaarykram ke tahat aman ke vaahan banane par itane focus the to unhone yudhak hathiyaaron ke nirmaan kaa kaam kyon chunaa
 Kalam replied, "I had no problem and there was no conflict between the two
" aisa yudhak bhandar banaakar main darasal apane desh ke liye aman-chaiyn hi pakkaa kar rahaa tha
 Now no country dares to attack us
 main aman ke hathiyaar bana rahaa hum
 "this interesting protest later became the title of my book on India's nuclear and missile history
" apane hippie baalo or ghisi hui chappalon vaale kalam ne jald hi diardl main nai jaan phoonk di, jo us samay agni or prithvi misile bana rahaa tha
 They set goals, drew tough reviews in the presence of users and inspired scientists to achieve results in their own specific style
 kalam ne mujhe bataaya ki ve hameshaa meeting ke liye puri tarah taiyaar hokar aate the or jise bhi unhone koi kaam saunpa hota tha, usase udaar anushaasan ke saath jawaab talab karte the
 "you don't even realize that he is your boss," says his colleague Ranga Rao
 aisa lagata tha ki ve pehle se hi maujuud hai
 "they considered Kalam as fatherhood
 kalam kii style kabhi bhi takaraav vaali nahin rahi or unke sabar kaa baandh bahut bada tha
 Instead of imposing their decisions, they always worked towards building consensus
 ve shaayad hi kabhi ukhdate the
 If someone disappointed them, they would simply say: Phani Guy, or who is this hero? Sometimes they say send that famous mechanic to me
 bharat ko jab koi bhi desh missile praudyogiki bechney ko taiyaar nahin tha, kalam ne swaavlamban ko lakshya banaaya or sari ahm takneekon ko desi tareeke se viksit kiya
 During his tenure at DRDL, Kalam did not stay in the director's bungalow and stayed in the guest house in only one room
 ve aadhi raat ke baad tak jaagate rahete the or pariyojna kii pragati kii samiksha karte the
 (most of the interviews i have had with him are mostly after one and a half when they were empty)
 iskaa fal bhi mila
 Kalam is credited for the spectacular transformation of a scientific institution in the history of India
 nabbe ke dashak ke madhya tak choti duuri kii parmaanu sakasham belistic missile prithvi or lambii duuri kii parmaanu missile agni kaa validation ho chukaa tha
 India Today named him Missile Man in 1994
 yah naam unki sthaayee pahchaan ban gaya
 At that time Kalam told me, India is now a missile power that can produce a series of missiles anytime and anywhere
 koi bhi pratibandh hamen daraa nahin saktaa
 One criticism was that Kalam's bus name is shining while his scientific abilities were questioned
 kalam aisi aalochanaon ko udaartaa se lete hue kehete the, "main to missile team kii kamyaabi kaa ek hissaa bhar tha" unhone mujhe apane saare nideshkon ke saath akele main baat karne kii aazaadee di thi
 He never insisted on looking at my manuscript and asked mockingly, "I hope you will not trouble me" i told him, "trust me, i will be fair"
 He never complained
 kalam kii kamyaabi kii vajah se unhen raksha mantri kaa vaigyanik salaahkaar bana diya gaya or diardio kaa mahanideshak bana diya gaya
 He was an officer of a central secretary level bungalow in Lutyens Delhi, yet he stayed in a room in the DRDO guest house and did not give up his old lifestyle
 kalam ko jo kaam saunpe gaye the, unamem ek yah tha ki ve parmaanu urja ayog ke sheersh vaigyanikon ke saath bharat ke parmaanu yudhak bhandar ko viksit karen
 Till then, the fact that Kalam had remained unmarried began to show that the strength of the Bachelor is behind India's new energy
 maine kalam se poocha tha ki unhone kabhi shaadi kyon nahin kii or ve muskaraate hue bole the, "hamaara parivaar kaaphi bada tha isliye hamaare bich koi ek bina bachche ke rah saktaa tha
 i decided to become Brahmachari! ”when I

 When Gujral became Prime Minister, he praised Kalam's work and simple lifestyle and called him a sage of Indian science
 gujral kii sarkaar ne hi kalam ko bharat ratna se nawaja tha
 Earlier, the opposition, especially BJP, had criticized Gujral for not doing enough to protect India
 gujral ne kalam ko sammanit kar ke unhone kai morchon par fatah hasil kar lee thi, "main na sirf apane desh ko balki puri duniya ko yah taqatvar sandesh dena chaah rahaa tha ki bharat apni suraksha ko kitni ahmiyat detaa he
 This message was also for those who do not trust Muslims
 maine kalam ko bharat ratna dekar unke munh band kar die hai
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who became Prime Minister after Gujral, was equally impressed with Kalam
 duusari baar satta main aane ke kuch maheenon ke bheetar hi 1998 kii may main vaajapeyi ne paanch parmaanu pareekshanon kaa aadesh diya or bharat ko parmaanu hathiyaar sampann raashtra ghoshit kar daalaa
 After watching the tests, Kalam Shairana, who was present in Pokaran, became
 unhone mujhase kaha, ''hamane jab dharti ko hilaayaa or vah hamaare kadamon ke neeche se daraki, to main aanandit ho uthaa
 i also felt that we have broken the domination of nuclear powers
 ab ek arab kii aabaadi vaale hamaare desh ko koi bhi yah nahin kah saktaa he ki hamen kya karnaa he
 We will decide for ourselves what we want to do
 ''kalam 1999 main diardio se sevanivrutt hue or unhone apana shesh jivan academik pahal ko samarpit karne kii yojana bana lee, lekin niyati ko kuch or hi manjuur tha
 The bjp-led coalition government elected him to the presidency in 2002, partly because of his being a Muslim
 yah sattadhari dal ke liye upyukt tha, kyonki vah isse apane dharmanirpeksh hone kaa pramaan de saktaa tha
 When i told him that many people were saying that he had been made president because of his religion, he replied, "really?" To be honest, i never thought that way
 maine to khud ko hameshaa bhartiya mana he
 "it would be ironic that the man who spent a lifetime in one room was now going to live in the country's largest residence
" maine jab bataaya ki unhen ab aupchaarik kapade pahanane honge or khaane kii mejabani kerani hogi, to ve bole, ''yah mere liye nayaa anubhav hoga, lekin aap khaanaa khate samay bhi kaaphi kaam nibata sakate hai
 What was Kalam's contribution? In his book Leading Minds: An Anatomy of Leadership, Howard Gardner has written about a visionary leader who is "a person who does not have the satisfaction of connecting to an existing story or bringing alive a story of a distant or recent past
" 
 aisa shaks vastav main nai kahani rachataa he, aisi jo adhiktar logon ko pehle se pataa hi na ho, or is kahani ko dusron tak prabhaavshaalee tareeke se pahunchane main ek had tak kamyaabi hasil kar letaa he
 "I believe that Kalam was such a leader
 unki jindagi apane aap main asaadhaaran aakhyaan thi
 The son of a modest Manjhi who crossed the wall of discrimination and poverty first to make his place in the line of top scientists and then contributed significantly to make India a space, missile and nuclear force

 The United Nations' Ban Ki-moon has warned that Israel's plans to build new settlements could be a "shocking blow" to the prospect of peace with Palestine
 tippaniyan Israel has announced the establishment of about three thousand Jewish settlements, although it has not revealed anything about the location
 media kii khabaron main kaha gaya he ki nayaa nirmaan pashchimi tat ke ‘i-1’ ilaake main bhi hoga
 "the UN secretary-general has expressed deep concern and disappointment with Israel's announcement of new settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank," a Moon spokesman said
 unhone kaha, bastiyaan basaanaa antarrashtriya kanoon ke tahat avaidh he
 This would be a major setback to the efforts being made towards a two-nation solution
 israel ne kareeb teen hajaar yahudee bastiyaan basaane kaa elaan kiya he, haalanki usne sthaan ke bare main kuch nahin bataaya he
 Media reports said that the new construction will also take place in the 'E-1' area of the west coast
 moon ke ek pravaktaa ne kaha, purvi jerusalem or west bank main israel kii ore se nai bastiyaan basaane ke elaan se sanyukt raashtra mahasachiv ne gahari chintaa or niraashaa jataai he
 He said, settling settlements is illegal under international law

 garajte sher ke logo (pratik chinh) vaali shivasena kii garjana in dinon kam hi sunai padati he
 Before the rise of Narendra Modi on the national plank, the Shiv Sena's intimidation in politics is now less visible
 pichley 5 saalon main maharashtra kii raajnneeti main shivasena kii bhoomika 'bade bhai' kii tulana main 'chote bhai' jaisi ho gai he
 The Shiv Sena, which made itself feel number one in the era of founder Bal Thackeray, is celebrating its 53rd Foundation Day today
 19 june, 1966 ko maratha asmita ko dhyaan main rakhte hue maharashtra ke sthaneey logon ke adhikaron ke liye sangharsh karne ke khatir bala sahib thakare ne shivasena kii neenv rakhi thi
 Shiv Sena is identified as a Hindu political party
 marathi maanush ke naam par raajnneetishivsena kii neenv rakhane vaale bal thakare mul rup se cartoonist the or ' maarmik' naam kii saptahik raajnneetik patrika ke jariye raajnneetik vishyon par tikhi tippanee kiya karte the, saath hi maratha samaaj ke logon ke haq kii aawaaj bhi uthaate the
 After immense success as a cartoonist, he decided to get on the political front
 aaj kii taarikh main shivasena kai rajyon main sakriy he, lekin iskaa raajnneetik prabhaav maharashtra main sabase zyada he
 The Shiv Sena has the status of a state-level party and has got the bow-arrow election symbol from the Election Commission
 bal thakare ke adarsh shivajichhatrapati shivaji, bal thakare ke adarsh rahe or vah maa bhavani ke bade bhakt the
 This is the reason why he adopted Maa Bhavani's vehicle lion as the insignia of Shiv Sena
 30 oktober, 1966 ko vijaydashami ke din shivasena ne shivatirth main pehali raily yojit kii jo behad kaamyaab rahi thi
 The party first raised the issue of Marathi manoos in 1967 and organized a rally on it
 tisare prayaas main kholaa khatashivsena ne astitv main aane ke baad pehla chunaav 1971 main ladaa tha, lekin nai naveli party ko kamyaabi nahin mili
 In 1973, 39 corporators won on Shiv Sena ticket
 1989 ke loksabhaa chunaav main apane tisare prayaas main shivasena ne pehali baar jeet hasil kii
 Subsequently, in 1990, Shiv Sena contested the Maharashtra Assembly elections and won 52 seats and achieved the status of opposition party in the state
 1989 main bijepi ke saath qaraar1990 ke dashak ke baad shivasena kaa maharashtra kii raajnneeti main jo rasookh kaayam hua wo abhi tak barkaraar he, haalanki abhi dabadabaa thodaa kam hua he
 The party entered into a political deal with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) before the 1989 assembly elections
 is gathbandhan ne pehali baar 1995 main sarkaar banaai, lekin 1999 ke baad se shivasena bijepi ke saath vipaksh main rahi
 Broken coalition, however, before the 2014 assembly elections, the alliance broke down and split from BJP over seat sharing
 donon ne alag-alag chunaav ladaa jisamen bijepi sabase badi party banakar ubhari, lekin is bich shivasena ne vipaksh main baithne kaa elaan kiya tha
 However, after several rounds of negotiations, the Shiv Sena agreed to form the government with the BJP and it was here that the Shiv Sena had to participate in power as a younger brother and got Devendra Fadnavis as the Chief Minister from the BJP
 iske baad brihmamumbai mahanagar palika (biemasi) ke chunaav main donon dal saath lade or mumbai main shivasena kii badshahath kaayam rahi
 About a year and a half before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, in 2018 the Shiv Sena decided to part ways with the BJP and the NDA government, but in February this year, on the back of BJP President Amit Shah's efforts, Shiv Sena announced to contest in the state with the BJP
 And contested 23 seats, and won 18 seats and achieved the number 2 position in the NDA
 haalanki is baar narendra modi ke mantrimandal main sirf ek saansad ko jagah mili, lekin loksabhaa main dipti spikar kaa pad par shivasena daavedaari kar rahi he
 After Bal Thackeray, the Shiv Sena led by Uddhav Thackeray had 18 Lok Sabha mps in the 16th Lok Sabha and this time the same number remained
 2014 ke baad se maharashtra kii raajnneeti main bijepi kii ahmiyat shivasena se badhati hi ja rahi he
 Like 2014, the Shiv Sena has failed to increase its seat count to 18 in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, while BJP contested 25 seats and won 23
 pichley 5 saalon main bijepi kaa graph maharashtra main lagaataar chadhataa ja rahaa he
 Now when assembly elections are due in Maharashtra after few months and both parties have agreed to fight on equal number of seats
 haalanki rajya main is baar bhi chunaav bijepi kii aguwai main ladaa jayega, lekin mukhyamantri pad ko lekar abhi ko formula tay nahin he
 However, the stature of Shiv Sena has declined in the state since Narendra Modi's entry into national politics
 iskar adhikariyon ke manamaani karne kii shikaayatein badhane se chintit iskar vibhaag ne unke liye nae dishanirdesh jari kar unase karadaataaon ke saath vinamrata se pesh aane ke liye kaha he

 The comments is sambandh main tipies nideshaalay kii pradhan mahanideshak nina kumaar ne deshbhar main vibhaag ke sabhi pramukhon ko patr likhaa he

 Regarding the disputed paintings of Hussain, the author holds his view that for thousands of years, Indian art has depicted the uncovered chest and vagina of the woman and exposed statues of gods and goddesses

 Bhowmick has raised several burning issues in the book

 Bhowmik maintains his opinion on these issues with impunity

 Here, Bhowmik adds, "A third stream of painting parallel to contemporary Indian painting and folk art will develop, which will communicate with a large section of society and increase its acceptance in society
" ''par kitaab ke ek lekh main hossain ke bahaane kala parampara kii charchaa he
 The reader feels a little disappointed here

 isamen yah bhi bataaya gaya he ki sabase zyada lokpray anushthanon-jaise vashtram or abhishekam jaisi sevaaon-ke tikat 2060 tak kaise jari kiye gaye or asli shraddhaluon ko unase vanchit kar diya gaya
 For this, some unscrupulous travel agents hacked ttd's website with the connivance of employees and made all the bookings

 Audiçasavulu was added to the board as political patronage after being made president
 unhone 2008 main loksabhaa main telegu desham party se alag hokar upie ke pehle kaarykaal ke dauraan vishwaas mat main manmohan singh sarkaar kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Dinesh Reddy submitted a 158-page report to the state government on August 13, 2010, recommending several measures to prevent the scandal
 ye hai:-booking ke sayam shraddhaluon kii pahchaan ke saboot maange jaaen or anushthan evam darshan ke samay aane par unki pahchaan milaai jaae
 The discretionary quota of trustees of TTD Board should be reduced
 -tikaton kii aisi bikri ko bada aparaadh maanakar sakht sajaa kaa praavdhaan kiya jaae
 Such suggestions and remedies are common
 choti sansthaaon ne inhen pehle hi lagu kar liya hota
 But the ttd's management structure and hierarchy impedes their implementation
 ve kisi pahal ko lagu nahin hone dete
 Ironically, the board, headed by Adikesavulu, had decided to recommend to the state government for a comprehensive inquiry into the activities of the temple administration from 2006 onwards
 yah salaahkaar kii bhoomika nibhaane main board kii vifaltaa kii sweekaarokti he
 But 14 members of the board are mainly responsible for this, who consider it an important position
 ve is pad par rahete 'e pakshpaat kar sakate hai or haal ke samay main unke sahyogiyon ne moti rakam lekar darshan ke tikat tak bech daale
 If any of their decision is against the financial interests of religion or TTD, then the government has the right to stop them
 iske liye kaaryakari adhikari ko bas sarkaar ko suchit karne kii jarurat he
 TTD has spiraled out of control because of its immense wealth
 use jhanjhat mukt darshan, suraksha, prasadam or rahane-sahane kii vyavastha jaisi shraddhalu kendrit sevaayen muhaiyaa karaane ke saath hi apane vitt ke prabandhan or baaki sari gatividhiyon ko outsource karne par dhyaan dena hoga
 Along with reducing spending, internal systems such as accounting must be strengthened and discretionary quotas reduced as it has become the center of corruption

 Some of them are about two decades in positions of policy
 titidi ke ek andruni sutara ne kaha, ‘bhagwaan hi araajaktaa ko dur sakate hai
 'it is difficult to take any kind of strict measures because quarrelsome employees will do such a thing to TTD management
 unamem kai naukari paane yogya nahin hai or unhen kareer se sambandhit prashikshan ke avasar uplabdh nahin hai
 But to remove chaos, political intervention has to be reduced and politicians have to be freed from the TTD board
 isamen daandaataaon ke pratinidhi, prasiddh locasevak or aise visheshgy hone chahie jo board ke kaamkaaj main sudhaar laa saken
 For this, TTD will have to run like a responsible corporate
 saath hi prashasan, vitt, suraksha or dharmik maamalon ke prabandhan main upyogi sarkari logon ko shaamil karnaa hoga
 Rosaiah will have to discourage state-of-the-art specific authority to implement these reforms
 lekin tab tak asahaay shraddhalu sirf govinda, govinda kaa hi jaap kar sakate hai

 This 94-year-old Hindi writer must have had her own physical problems, there may have been some pressure of age, but she was completely healthy and happy with her mind
 jo jeevat unke sahitya kaa beej shabd rahaa, darasal vahi unke jivan kaa bhi mul mantra tha
 She was as bold as her heroines
 unki nayikaayen jis haal main hon, kabhi 'peedit' yaa 'shikaar' hone kii kuntha unke bheetar nahin dikhti
 Life is the name of their stubbornness
 ve bemauf, bedadak, roodhiyon kii parvaah na karne vaali auraten hai jo yathasthiti ko baar-baar chunauti detii hai, jivan ko uski di hui sharton par manzur nahin karatin, use apane dhang se badalane kaa jatan karti hai
 Friends beaten with chronology seem helpless from nowhere, she hesitates about the heat of her personalities, openly chats with Sardar Lal's friends, and also reminds her mother-in-law and devranis when she Is beyond his bounds and his gifts
 beshak, ye nayikaayen kai baar ek had tak jaakar laut bhi aati hai, lekin yah lautne kaa faisalaa bhi unka hi hota he

 Why does coalition intimidate Narendra Modi? There are many writers in Hindi literature today
 stri lekhan or stri vimarsh jaise ek visphot kii tarah hamaare saamne he
 But this situation has not happened spontaneously
 iske strot bhi jin kuch logon ke lekhan tak jate hai, unamem krishna sobati ahm raheen
 The era she was writing was basically a period of male writers - that writing had a lot of middle class life but women were not in place or even around the image created by men
 tab bahut kam lekhikaayen raheen jinhone apane samay ke lekhakon ke bich apni alag pahchaan banaai
 After poems like Mahadevi Varma and Subhadra Kumari Chauhan - especially in prose writing - Krishna Sobti and Mannu Bhandari can be counted among the early episodes of this series
 in do lekhikaon ne apane samay ke kathakaron- rajendra yadav, kamaleshwar, mohan rakesh, bhishma saahani, nirmal vrarma aadi ko shoharat ke str par lagbhag barabari kii takkar di
 Later writers like Mridula Garg, Mamta Kalia, Usha Priyamvada, Chitra Mudgal and Nasira Sharma further reinforced the tradition
 beshak, krishna sobati ke vipul viraat lekhan kii chaaya puure hindi sahitya or samaaj par padi
 Suddenly, Shokha, Babaak and stubborn heroines became common, people who avoided telling stories
 vaise stri-swatantray yaa barabari ke ye vaicharik sutara krishna sobati ke lekhan main kisi shunya se nahin aae the yaa kisi iklauti zid kii tarah maujuud nahin the, ve ek samgr vaicharikta kaa hissaa the jisamen azaad bharat kii samskritibahulata or barabari ke adarsh kii bhi jagah thi
 Krishna Sobti, who studied in Lahore and made Delhi her destination, knew the brunt of the partition and understood how much political or communal fanatics derive their value from humanity
 yahi vajah he ki haal ke dinon main badhati sampradayikta or ashishnutaa ke viruddh is umr main bhi awaz uthaane main unhone kotahi nahin kii
 We are in the Namvar Hospital to irrigate all of us, it is difficult to imagine a creature like him at the age of 94
 ve jab bhi milteen, bahut utsaah se milteen, apni takalifon kii nahin, desh or duniya kii baat karatin
 For him, the political situation of the current era was very important
 unako lagata tha ki unki kalpanaaon kaa hindustan yah nahin he jo banaaya ja rahaa he
 About two years ago, when i went to meet him, he spoke very strongly about all this
 ham bas abhibhoot yah dekhte rahe ki nabbe paar kii yah lekhika maansik taur par kitni chust-durust he
 This morning i spoke to Om Thanvi, former editor and intellectual of Jansatta
 ve yaad kar rahe the ki beemaari ke in dinon main bhi unhone apni utfullata kaa daaman nahin choda tha
 Thanvi ji told that a few days ago when he was out and could not meet Krishna Sobti, he got a message recorded on Krishna ji's mobile - without you Delhi seems a little less Delhi
 mujhe khyal aayaa- krishna sobati ke bina bhi duniya kuch duniya ho gai he, hindi kuch kam hindi ho gai he or dilli kuch kam dilli rah gai he

 jaipur main rajasthan royles ke khilaaf shahi jeet hasil karne vaali team kolkata nide rides ke pramukh gendbaaj kuldeep yadav ne match ke baad kai dilachasp khulaase kiye
 In this match, Rajasthan team came out to bat first and could only score 139 / 3 runs in 20 overs
 jawaab main kolkata kii team ne is match ko 14wein over kii 5veen gend par (140 / 2) hi jeet hasil kar lee
 With this victory, Kolkata has retained the number one chair, beating MS Dhoni's team in the point table of the 12th season of IPL
 rajasthan ke khilaaf match ko jaldi khatm karne ko lekar kuldeep yadav ne match ke baad kaha ki team kii manshaa ran rate ko sudhaarna tha, isliye match ko 14 over main hi khatm kar diya
 What is the benefit of finishing early? Match 6
 1 over rahete hi jeetne kaa phayda yah hua ki chennai or kolkata kii tiimon kaa 8-8 ank hone ke baavjood keker ne siesake ko ank talika main duusare number par dhakel diya
 Because Kolkata had surpassed Chennai in terms of run rate
 agar yah match 20 over tak khinchataa to rajasthan kaa ran rate bighad saktaa tha
 Kuldeep further said that Jaipur pitch was very slow
 mere liye vahaan gendbaaji karnaa mushkil tha, lekin team ke anya gendbaajon ke liye pich acchhee thi
 This is the reason that Piyush Chawla and Harry Garne bowled economically and Rajasthan's team could score only 139 runs
 saath hi kuldeep ne kaha ki hamane ek team ke rup main pradarshan kiya, jisase hamen kamyaabi mili
 After Sunday's second match, Kolkata tops Parrukh rukh

 Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav and Chau at the first joint rally of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Samajwadi Party (SP) and RLD alliance in western Uttar Pradesh in the Lok Sabha elections
 ajit singh ne bhartiya janata party par ek saath siyaasi hamalaa bolaa he
 The more Mayawati appeared on the BJP, the more fearful the Congress was
 akhilesh or ajit ne mayawati kii maujuudagi main dalit voton ko saadhane kii koshish kii
 Mayawati bluntly said, 'when the PM gets information about the huge crowd of this Maharali, then he will panic and go mad with the alliance
 ’ unhone desh ke vartmaan halaat ke liye bhaajapa or congress donon ko baraabar kii jimmedaar bataaya
 At the rally, Mayawati sarcastically said that during the election season, both these parties miss the schemes of giving money to the poor, the Ganga Yatra and the Khat Yatra, apart from being drenched in religious places
 mayawati ne musalamaanon ko khaas taur par congress se saavdhaan kiya or akhilesh ne congress or bhaajapa ko ek bataaya
 Ajit even called the stray cattle as 'yogi and Modi'
 devband kii mahareli main mayawati sabase pehle or sabase der tak boleen
 He started with an attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his speech
 vah boleen, gathbandhan se piem modi ghabrahat main hai or ise ‘saraab’ ke baad ab kuch bhi kah sakate hai
 After independence, the Congress and BJP governments remained in power at the Center and in most states of the country
 apni janvirohi galat nitiyon ke kaaran congress satta se baahar ho chuki he or bhaajapa baahar hone ja rahi he
 This time the drama of the watchman is also not going to work
 har varg ko pralobhan dekar satta main ai bhaajapa ne ek chauthai vaayade bhi puure nahin kiye
 Even on the day of the Pulwama attack, bjp's drama has exposed their nationalism
 bhaajapa kii centre sarkaar ne janata ke hajaaron karod rupee apane phaayde ke liye sarkari khajaane se kharch kiye, jinhen garib hit main kharch kiya ja saktaa tha
 Mayawati surrounded the BJP on the arrears of sugarcane price and reminded that the non-cane paying mill owners were sent to jail under the BSP regime
 raksha saudon main dallali ke maamle main mayawati ne congress or bhaajapa par ek saath prahaar kiye or apane votbank ko media, opinian pole or chunavi surveykshanon ke jhooth se saavdhaan rahane kii hidaayat di
 The Muslims were also warned that the Congress was not worth it, which should be voted
 sapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne is loksabhaa chunaav ko itihaas banane vaala bataaya or kah ki west upi kisaanon kii dharti he
 Today, sugarcane farmers are in a bad state and the sugar mills owe a payment of Rs 5000 crore to the sugar mills in the districts of the first phase of elections in western UP
 noujvaan berozegaar hai, duniya ke desh tarakkee kar gaye, lekin hamaara desh peeche rah gaya he
 Walls of hatred were erected in a country whose youth had to move beyond knowledge and science
 angrejon ke baad bhaajapa ne desh main baanto or raaj karo par amal kiya he
 BJP people become the contractors of religion, but the whole world saw how to take bath in Kumbh
 agar upi ke mukhyamantri kaa kumbh snaan dekh len to log nahaana hi chhod den
 People could not see even 56 inch chest
 yah chunaav parivartan or bhaichaare kaa chunaav he
 The BJP is nervous about the alliance and we have given a reply to the BJP in the results of the Lok Sabha by-election
 unhone kaha ki jo congress he vahi bijepi he or bijepi he vahi congress he
 Congress also does not want to bring change
 ralod ke mukhiya chau
 Ajit Singh kept his entire focus on farmers and Dalits
 bole, vot daalane kaa adhikaar hamen samvidhan ne diya he or samvidhan baba sahab ambedkar kii dein he
 BJP wants to snatch it
 yah adhikaar he to saare dal janata se har paanch saal main certificate lete hai or yah nahin rahaa to kuch nahin bachegaa
 Taking a sarcasm at Modi, he said - only the prime minister's good days came
 vah muft kii khate hai, din main teen baar suut badalte hai or sarkari kharche par videsh yatraaen karte hai
 Such a government should be stung
 modi ne vaada kiya tha ki swaminathan ayog kii siforeeshon ke mutabik kisaanon ko fasalon kii utpaadan laagat kaa 150 fisadi mulya or ganne kaa 14 dinon main bhugtan kiya jayega, lekin kuch nahin hua
 The BJP government did not increase the price of sugarcane by one rupee, but the governments of Mayawati and Mulayam Singh Yadav increased the price of sugarcane greatly
 mayawati ne bhugtan na karne vaale mil maalikon ke khilaaf sakht kadam uthaae
 The economy of West UP depends on the sugarcane crop
 pehle 25 kimi ke daayre main chini mil hoti thi, lekin unhone yah faasla 15 kimi karaayaa
 His efforts led to 47 new sugar mills in 15 years
 pehle ek tihaai ganna milon main jaataa tha, lekin adhik chini milen lagane se sara ganna milon ko jane laga
 Akhilesh alleged that the BJP is anti-farmer and rioted in Muzaffarnagar and came to power
 notebandi or jiesti ke prabhaav par bhi ajit ne charchaa kii or kisaanon kii fasalon ko raundne vaale aawaara maweshiyon ko modi or yogi kahkar kataaksh kiye
 All three leaders appealed to the people to vote separately for the coalition candidates
 bheed ke lihaaj se gathbandhan kii yah raily pradhanmantri narendra modi kii raily jaisi hi rahi, jisamen dalit, muslim or jaaton kii bhaagedari najar ai
 Posters of some young Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar kept waving in front of the stage, but Mayawati paid no attention to it
 alabatta itnaa jarur kaha ki bhaajapa kuch farji sanghathanon or partiyon ke jariye vot kaatane kii koshash karegi, jisase saavdhaan rahanaa he
 In total, all three parties were seen casting votes on the basis of votes of each other

 These speculations got a boost when Amit Shah also held a meeting with Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satyapal Malik after assuming the Home Ministry

 i will only ask - what is the reason that 'development' is missing in the speeches of the Prime Minister this time? i asked 10 questions from the report card of Gujarat, they are not answered
 pehle charan kaa prachaar khatm hone tak ghoshnaa patr nahin
 So is 'speech is the rule' now? - Office of RG (@officeofrg) December 9, 2017 Earlier Rahul Gandhi has asked 10 questions one by one to Prime Minister Modi
 rahune ne apane sawaalon main gujarat main shiksha, rojgaar, mahila suraksha jaise ahm muddon ke uthaaya he
 Rahul's first question reminded Prime Minister Modi of his promise to give home to the poor and homeless of Gujarat
 kya hai abhi tak ke 10 savaalkahan gaye 55 hajaar karod (dasvaan sawaal)rahul ne 10waan sawaal karte hue bijepi par adivaasiyon kii jameen chhinane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Rahul had asked that rights on the forest are stuck, millions of land leases are stuck, neither the public got the school nor the homeless could get the hospital
 rahul ne aarope lagayaa ki yuva ko rojgaar nahin or adivasee samaaj palayan kar rahaa he
 Where did 55 thousand crores of PM Modi's Vanbandhu scheme go? Please tell the ghera (ninth question) on loan waiver that Rahul has asked nine questions so far
 guuruuvaar ko apane nauven sawaal main rahul ne gujarat main karj maafee, fasal ke daam or fasal beemaa kii raashi par sawaal uthaae the
 Rahul tweeted, "neither loan waiver, nor did not get the right price for the crop, did not get crop insurance amount, did not arrange tubewells, killed Gabbar Singh on farming, took away the land, made the donor useless, PM sir, tell me Why so much treatment with Khedut? ”raised the issue of malnutrition (eighth question) On Wednesday, PM had questioned the issues of malnutrition in Gujarat
 rahul ne twit kiya, pradhanmantriji-8waan sawaal: 39% bachche kuposhan se bezaar har 1000 main 33 navjaat maut ke shikaar chikitsa ke badhate hue bhav doctoron kaa ghor abhaav bhuj main 'mitra' ko 99 saal ke liye diya sarkari aspataal kya yahi he aapke swasthya prabandh kaa kamaal?mahangaai par bhi gheraa (saatvaan sawaal)rahul gandhi kaa 7waan sawaal mahangaai ke mudde par tha
 He had said that the infidelity of the jumlas was killed, demonetisation was looted, the GST killed all the earnings, the rest was left and inflation was killed
 badhate daamon se jeena dushwaar bas amiron kii hogi bhaajapa sarkaar?'vetan ayog par sawaal (chatha sawaal)rahul gandhi abhi tak kul chha: sawaal puch chuke hai
 Asking the sixth question, the Pay Commission questioned the salary
 rahul ne apane twit main poocha ki ''bhaajapa kii dohari maar ek taraf yuva berozegaar duusari taraf lakhon fiks pagaar or kontract karmchaaree bezaar 7wein vetan ayog main ₹18000 masik hone ke baavjood fiks or kontract pagaar ₹5500 or ₹1 xxrep 4 0 kyon? 'mahila suraksha par poocha prashn (paanchavaa sawaal)rahul ne ravivaar ko twitor par 5waan sawaal karte hue gujarat main mahilaon kii suraksha, shiksha or swasthya kaa maamla uthaaya tha
 Rahul had questioned the BJP, which held power in Gujarat for 22 years, questioning PM Modi
 rahul ne twit karte hue likhaa, 'na suraksha, na shiksha, na poshan, mahilaon ko mila to sirf shoshan, anganwari varkar or aashaa, sabko di bas niraashaa, gujarat kii bahanon se kiya sirf vaada, puraa karne kaa kabhi nahin tha iraadaa'
 With this question, Rahul has also written the answer to the hashtag Gujarat
 shiksha par maanga jawaab (chauthaa sawaal )gujarat_maange_jawaab ke saath rahul gandhi ne subah apana chauthaa sawaal twit kiya
 In this tweet, he wrote with the title 'prime Minister- Fourth question', 'at the cost of government school-college, did business of education, hit every student with expensive fees, how will the dream of New India come true?' Tanja (third question) Rahul's third question is related to power supply in Gujarat
 rahul ne twit kar modi se poocha ki 2002-16 ke bich 62 hajaar 549 karod kii bijli kharid kar 4 nijee companiyon kii jeb kyon bhari? saath hi rahul gandhi ne gujarat sarkaar par sarkari bijli kaarkaanon kii kshamta ghataane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Rahul said that the capacity of the government power plants was reduced by 62 percent but why did he buy electricity from a private company for Rs 3 per unit for Rs 24? Targeting the loan (second question) Rahul's second question was that in 1995, Gujarat was paid Rs 9,183 crore
 There was debt and in 2017, Gujarat has a debt of 2,41,000 crore
 yani har gujarati par 37 hajaar rupee kaa karj he
 Keeping these figures in front, Rahul Gandhi has asked why the people of Gujarat should pay the penalty of financial mismanagement and publicity of Narendra Modi? Housing to the poor (first question) Rahul started his question on November 29
 congress upaadhyaksh ne twit karte hue pehla sawaal poocha, '22 saalon kaa hisaab, gujarat maange jawaab, gujarat ke halaat par pradhanmantriji se pehla sawaal: 2012 main vaada kiya ki 50 lakh nae ghar denge, 5 saal main banaae 4
 72 lakh houses
 pradhanmantriji bataaie ki kya ye vaada puraa hone main 45 saal or lagenge'
 Rahul Gandhi is reminiscent of the election promises made by the BJP in the last election

 jab vaasana niyantrit hoti he, to das indriyon (dasharath) kii mrityu hoti he or ram, sita va lakshmana (aatma, sharir or man) kaa niyantran khota he
 In the Ramayana, lust is the symbol of Bali, killed by Rama (consciousness), not by Lakshmana (mind)
 budhimatta (sugriv) se vaasana (bali) nahin maaraa ja saktaa
 It can only be struck from behind, not from the front, which is based on the principle of Pratihara in Patanjali's Yoga Sutra

 inase teevr talab ko dur karne main madad mil sakati he
 * Identify trigger conditions that provoke you to smoke
 inase bachane ke liye yaa vaikalpik rup se is talab ko shant karne kii yojana taiyaar rakhie
 * Chew sugarfree gum or hard candy, or keep raw carrots, celery, nuts or sunflower seeds nearby

 One such dreadful double murder was on which the films were made
 ek aisa hatyakand jis par kitaab likhi gai
 The author claims that before writing the book, he talked to every person who had even a little connection with that case

 When this book was launched, all the knowledge of Talwar couple, their relatives were present
 is cese kii penchidagi ne hi pichley saat saal se is maamle kodesh kaa sabase charchit or jatil hatyakandabana diya

 har vyakti is maamle main nyaay chahta tha, lekin har kisi ke liye nyaay kii paribhaasha alag thi
 The 208-page case verdict led many to believe that if the doctor couple murdered their 14-year-old daughter and domestic help, there was less severe punishment for them

 lekhak or vakil tanwir donon kaa maananaa he ki kai aise tathy hai jiske aadhaar par upree adaalatein talwaar danpati ke paksh main faisla de sakati hai
 The main ones are: 1
 narco test main naukaron ne aparaadh karnaa sweekaar kiya
 2
 sibiai ke kai logon ne yah bayaan diya tha ki naukaron ne apane bayanon main bhi aparaadh sweekaar kiya he
 3

 Om Prakash Rajbhar is a minister in the Yogi government
 bhartiya samaaj party ke adhyaksh bhi hai
 Om Prakash Rajbhar, while becoming an MLA and becoming a minister, has clearly written in the section of the fundamental right of the Constitution which he takes oath that it will be the duty of every citizen of India to have a scientific outlook, humanism, and a sense of learning and reform
 Develop
 om prakaash rajbhar hi nahin, khud se bhi or baaki sarkaron se bhi poochna chahie ki kya ham apana yah kartavya nibhaa rahe hai
 Om Prakash Rajbhar is the cabinet minister of the Ministry of Backward Welfare, Ministry of Disabled Public Empowerment in the Yogi government
 unhone 20 may ko baliya main ek raily main jo baat kahi he use aap jaan lijie
 He has said, "unless someone from your state and district team goes between you till taking the instructions of Omprakash Rajbhar, then if anyone goes close to any party, then understand that Omprakash Rajbhar will curse him, what will happen There will be curse, he will have jaundice
 
 You have come here, think it will cause jaundice, it will happen only when Omprakash Rajbhar's medicines are taken, then only jaundice will be fine or else it will not be right
 
 
 ' They are telling the public not to go to another party rally because Omprakash ji will curse and when he curses, he will get jaundice
 hamaare netaaon ko vaigyanik prashikshan kii sakht zarurat he
 At least Om Prakash Rajbhar should go to the National Health Portal of the Government of India where the reasons for jaundice have been explained
 un kaarnon main kahin nahin likhaa he ki omprakash rajbhar ke shraap dene se pilia kii beemaari hoti he
 Not only this, after getting jaundice, Rajbhar ji also gives medicines to recover, from which lab is that medicine available, only he can tell
 bharat kii raajnneeti main netaa kuch bhi bol kar nikal jate hai
 This confidence of him should be praised

 The term jaundice is used to refer to yellowing of the skin and whitening of the eyes

 Any condition due to which the activity of bilirubin is obstructed by blood from the liver and outside the body
 uske kaaran pilia hota he
 Bilirubin is a yellow pigment formed by the breakdown of dead red blood cells in the liver
 iske alaava kai anya tareeke hai jinke madhyam se billirubin banataa he
 It is not written anywhere that jaundice is caused by Omprakash Rajbhar's curse or jaundice is caused by cursing when he goes to any rally without his permission

 a case under murder and SC / ST Act has been registered against the five people who killed it
 inke naam hai chiraag vora, divyesh vora, jaysukh radadia, tejas jaala
 The fifth accused is under 18 years of age but has also been detained
 police donon pakshon ke daawey kii jaanch kar rahi he magar mukesh vania kii maut ho gai he
 There is no need to investigate for this
 yah koi pehali ghatana nahin he, haal philhal ke dinon main hi desh bhar main itani ghatnaayen ho chuki hai jo bataati hai ki ek tabaka lagaataar bada hota ja rahaa he jisane jati or dharm ke aadhaar par ek khaas tabake ko bardaasht na karne kii zid thaan lee he
 We are seeing this result of the politics of spreading hate in the name of caste and religion
 21 march 2018 ke times of india main ek khabar chhapi thi
 An RTI reply by a Dalit activist from Mehsana revealed that Gujarat had 1515 cases registered in the year 2017, the highest in the past 17 years
 aaj hi amit shah karnataka main dalit utpeedan kii baat kar rahe the
 Which will also be right, but can they talk about Gujarat
 enciarabi ke data ke hisaab se dalit utpeedan main gujarat kaa sthaan 10 he or karnataka kaa 6
 Which state does not have this hatred and which political ideology is getting this hate from people
 badhaava mil rahaa he
 There has been a lot of talk of the danger of democracy during the Karnataka elections
 magar aapako koi netaa khatare main nahin dikhegaa
 Public remains in danger jab bhi aap akele hote hai, bheed se alag, aapako pataa chalata he ki aap khatare main hai, loktantr kii baat karne vaale netaa nahin
 No matter how big the breaking news is in the world, every day youngsters make the message that when will they return to the job series
 hamaari naukari kii baat kiijie
 But the same youth are also using firewood in the politics of hate
 samajhnaa mushkil he ki naujavaanon kii praathamikta kya he
 They are thinking more of hate at the moment or are thinking more about jobs
 ummid he ve nafrat kii baton ko samajhenge
 No one else will understand the job
 na netaa na media
 Nevertheless, we are returning to the job series
 naujavaanon ke saath vaaki ninsaphi ho rahi he
 At the time when young people are seeking jobs, no one is talking about their jobs
 naukari kii baat sirf chunaavon ke samay hording par hoti he
 We will try to return to different states again with the help of our limited resources to see why there is a delay in getting the joining letter, how much it is delayed, why the examination is delayed after the advertisement is out, you Youngsters are expected primetimewithravish @ gmail

 a student from Banaras came to our colleague Ajay Singh
 uskaa daawa he ki usne staff salection kii pariksha paas to kar lee thi magar paas hone kii soochna samay se nahin pahunchi or wo document kii jaanch nahin kara paaya
 His rank was 12th, even after that he remained in the job
 akaash pandeya naam kaa yah ladkaa yahaan vahaan bhatak rahaa he
 Now neither Hindu nor Muslim are coming to his work
 court main gaya he
 But this time the situation is that Akash did not get a job
 junior wireles officer kii pariksha paas karne ke baad, 12wein rank par aane ke baad bhi samay par soochna nahin milane ke kaaran naukari nahin mili
 Its examination for 51 posts took place on 18 November
 isamen ye ladkaa paas kar gaya
 Akash felt that information would come from SSC
 wo regular esemes or email check karata rahaa
 Also used to check the website periodically
 kai dinon baad akaash ne jab website dekhi to uske hosh ud gaye
 The result was out and all the dates were gone
 akaash kaa daawa he ki jab usne staff salection kamishan se artiai ke zarie soochna maangi to jawaab mila ki website par thode samay ke liye soochna di gai thi, aapako dekhnaa chahie tha ye aapaki galati he
 What does short notice mean? iske baad akaash yahaan vahaan pataa karne laga
 When asked the nearby students, they came to know that they had received an email and an SMS
 magar akaash kaa daawa he ki use na to esemes aayaa na email se soochna mili
 Even by bringing 12th rank in the restoration of 51 posts, Akash is unable to understand why this happened to him
 agar koi chook thi to kya yah itnaa bada maamla tha jise thik nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 More than half of May has passed, but do you know what the result of the CBI investigation of the Staff Selection Commission examination in the month of March has been
 media kii khabaron se pataa chalata he ki 27 march ko upi police ke special task force or dilli police ne milakar chaar logon ko giraftaar kiya tha
 Then 50 lakh rupees were also recovered from them
 iske aage kya pragati hui he, sibiai kii jaanch kis str par saarvajanik jaankaree nahin he
 The matter of leaking of question papers in the SSC examination throughout March was raised with great noise, because the students gathered in large numbers outside the Staff Selection Commission office for several days
 congress, bijepi or swaraj india ke netaa inke bich aate jate rahe
 On 6 March, Home Minister Rajnath Singh also ordered a CBI inquiry
 chaatro kii maang thi ki is saal 17 farvari se 22 farvari ke bich jo parikshaayen hui thim, unamem bade paimaane par prashn patr li hue hai
 The students were waiting for the report of the inquiry when the news came that the staff selection commission chairman Aseem Khurana's tenure has been extended by one year
 donon main koi sambandh nahin he basharte prashn patron ke li hone kii jaanch ho jaati
 However, there is anger among the students about this
 swaraj india ke anupam ne bayaan jari kar khurana ke kaarykaal badaye jane kii aalochana kii he
 In the first phase of the job series, we had shown that students who passed the CHSL 2015 and CGL 2016 exams are not getting the joining letter even after passing
 series ke baad kai hazaar chaatro ko jwining letters mila he? pichley hafte se sieji main assistant audit afasar ke pad par 1000 chaatro kii jwining ho rahi he
 As soon as we join, send us a message of thanks
 kaash sabake saath aisa ho jaataa
 Why many students of CHSL 2015 still have not received the joining letter
 inkaa kahana he ki kai vibhaagon ne niyukti patr to de die, chaatro ne jwine bhi kar liya magar abhi bhi kuch vibhaag aise hai jo niyukti patr nahin de rahe hai
 Address on the phone says that the appointment will be in july-august
 bataaiye agast 2017 main rigelt aayaa or ek saal lagegaa niyukti hone main
 With this, now those students are upset who have given the CGL 2016 exam, the result has come but the appointment letter is not being received
 ham jis pariksha kii baat kar rahe hai uskaa notification oktober 2016 main niklaa tha
 Advertisement was issued for 6708 posts
 postal sahaayak ke liye 3295 or eldisi ke liye 2878 pad the
 The exam goes on for two years
 naujavaanon kii ummiido ke saath aisa kyon hota he
 The Staff Selection Commission website shows that the result was released on February 16, it has been revised in May
 hamane esayssi ko jawaab ke liye email kiya he, jab aayega yaa agar aayega to dikhaaenge magar hazaron kii sankhya main chaatr system ke dhimi gati ke shikaar hote rahenge to kaise chalegaa
 These students are so timid or say that they are nervous that they cannot even make their videos
 hazaron kii sankhya main chaatr hai, inaki maang bhi jaays he phir bhi agar saamne nahin aaenge to ham dikhaaenge kaise
 Some students have sent audio recordings
 tippaniyan You viewers know that we were doing bank series continuously
 bich main chhod diya kyonki baat aage bad nahin rahi thi
 Some banks have ordered to construct toilets for women bankers
 ab itnaa vakt to ho hi chukaa he ki shauchalay ban janaa chahie
 The basic demand of bankers is also salary due to working conditions, stresses, so we wanted to look into them through these things, so we do not care about the holiday in addition to cross selling, worrying about the transfer of women bankers Doing it, whether it is a female or a male banker, not getting discharged if they fall ill or the family members get sick, all these things are also important
 hamane yah bhi dekha ki is bich kuch bankeron par hamale bhi hue
 There were also reports of suicide
 banking duniya ke bheetar kaaphi kuch acha nahin he
 On 21 May, Alok Chander, who was posted as manager at the Bank of Baroda in Arwal, Bihar, was shot dead
 unhen teen gaaliyon maari gayi
 Alok was a resident of Kutri village of Warsaliganj police station of Nawada
 is hatya ke virodh main bank karmchaariyon ne muzaffarpur main candal march nikaala
 Recently, bankers staged a sit-in in Jaipur for their security and other demands

 Please provide your number unhone kaha he, 'jab tak omprakash rajbhar kaa nirdesh lekar ke aapke pradesh or jila kii team jab tak aapke bich nahin jaaegi, tab tak kisi party ke kareeb agar koi gaya to ye samaj lenaa ki omprakash rajbhar kaa usko shraap ho jayega, kya hoga shraap hoga, usko pilia ho jayega
 
 aap yahaan aae ho soch lo use pilia ho jayega, thik tabhi hoga jab omprakash rajbhar kii dawaai loge, tabhi pilia thik hoga varanaa thik nahin hoga
 
 
 ' ye janata se kah rahe hai ki duusare dal kii raily main nahin jaae kyonki omprakash ji shraap de denge or jab shraap de denge to pilia kii beemaari ho jaaegi
 Our leaders are in dire need of scientific training
 kam se kam om prakaash rajbhar bharat sarkaar ke rashtriya swasthya portal par chale jaaen jahaan pilia hone ke kaaran bataae gaye hai
 Nowhere is it written that the curse of Omprakash Rajbhar causes jaundice
 yahi nahin pilia ho jane par rajbhar ji thik hone kii dawaai bhi dete hai, wo dawa kis lab se paas he, vahi bataa sakate hai
 In India's politics, leaders leave by speaking anything
 unke is aatmavishvaas kii prashansa kii jaani chahie
 Some call the Leader of the Opposition a dog cat snake petals, others call the Governor a dog
 kisi ko plastic surgery kaa mul ganesh ji main dikh jaataa he to kisi ko aaj kii duniya kii har chiz us daur main dikh jaati he jiske pramaan kabhi mili hi nahin
 Look confidently that on Constitution Day, Ambedkar also chants Ambedkar's name, forgetting that the development of scientific attitude has been described in the Constitution as the duty of every citizen
 pilia shabd kaa upyog twachaa ke peelepan or ankhon kii safedi bataane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The reason for this is the formation of a substance in the body's tissues and blood, which is called bilirubin
 koi bhi sthiti jinke kaaran billirubin kii gatividhiyaan rakt se liver or sharir se baahar baadhit hoti hai
 It causes jaundice
 billirubin pile rang kaa pigment he, jo ki liver main mrit laal rakt koshikaon ke tuutane se banataa he
 Apart from this, there are many other ways through which bilirubin is formed
 isamen kahin nahin likhaa he ki omprakash rajbhar ke shraap ke kaaran pilia kii beemaari hoti he yaa bina unki ijazat ke kisi kii raily main jane par shraap dene se pilia hota he
 If we are not spared from this daily practice of foolishness, then one day we will understand our ignorance as science
 koi itihaas ko lekar jhooth bol detaa he, koi vigyaan ko lekar kuch bhi bol detaa he
 Are we ready to teach these idiots in school books now? vaigyanik or maanavtawaad main ham kis kadar fail hue hai, iskaa ek krur namoona dikhaata hum
 Not only institutions, but also in society, there are so many layers of cruelty that we do not know where humanism and brotherhood has ended, or when the proof of its end will come in front of us
 sochie, aisa kya gunaah rahaa hoga iskaa, is vyakti se itani nafrat hone kii kya vajah rahi hogi ki is tarah se baandh kar maaraa ja rahaa he
 This is a video from a factory in Rajkot, Gujarat, which was tweeted by MLA Jignesh Mevani
 yah aadmi jise maaraa ja rahaa he, wo mar gaya
 According to the police complaint, on the orders of the owner of the auto part factory, it was tied and killed like this
 isaki patni ko bhi maaraa gaya
 Mukesh Vaniya shouted, kept shouting but there was no difference to those who killed him
 jignesh ne bataaya ki mukesh vania dalit samudaay se he
 This is a picture of today's India
 2016 main gujarat main oona kii ghatana ke baad kitni bahes hui uske baad bhi samaaj ke bheetar koi fark nahin padaa
 How does the ego of caste or getting rich become so big that a human being is tied and killed like this
 mukesh kii patni kisi tarah bhaagi, gaanv waalon se madad maangi lekin jab tak vah lauti, mukesh zamin par adhamra padaa tha
 He had died while carrying him to the hospital
 isaki jaan lene vaale paanch logon ke khilaaf hatya or essi / asti act ke tahat mukadmaa darj kiya gaya he
 His names are Chirag Vora, Divyesh Vora, Jaisukh Radadia, Tejas Zala
 paanchavaa abhiyukt 18 saal se kam kaa he magar use bhi hiraasat main liya gaya he
 Police are investigating the claims of both the sides but Mukesh Vaniya has died
 iske liye jaanch kii koi zarurat nahin he
 This is not the first incident, in recent times, there have been so many incidents across the country which show that a section is becoming increasingly large which has determined not to tolerate a particular section on the basis of caste and religion
 Have taken jati or dharm ke naam par nafrat failaane kii raajnneeti kaa yah nateeja ham dekh rahe hai
 a news was published in the Times of India on 21 March 2018
 mehsana ke ek dalit kaaryakarta ke artiai ke jawaab main jaankaree saamne ai ki gujarat main 2017 ke saal main 1515 maamle darj hue the jo pichley 17 saal main sabase adhik tha
 Today, Amit Shah was talking about the oppression of Dalits in Karnataka
 jo ki sahi bhi hoga, magar kya ve gujarat kii baat kar sakate hai
 According to NCRB data, Gujarat ranks 10 and Karnataka 6 in Dalit oppression
 kis rajya main yah nafrat nahin he or is nafrat ko kis raajnneetik vichaardhaara ke logon se prashray mil rahaa he
 It is getting a boost
 karnataka chunaavon ke dauraan loktantr ke khatare kii khub baat hui he
 But you will not see any leader in danger
 khatare main to lok rahata he
 Whenever you are alone, apart from the crowd, you realize that you are in danger, not a leader talking about democracy
 duniya main chaahe jitani badi braking news ho jaae, noujvaan har din yahi massej karte hai ki naukari series par kab lautenge
 Talk about our job
 magar yahi noujvaan nafrat kii raajnneeti main jalaavan ke kaam bhi aa rahe hai
 It is difficult to understand what is the priority of the youth
 ve is vakt nafrat kii baat zyaada soch rahe hai yaa naukari kii baat zyaada soch rahe hai
 Hopefully they will understand the words of hate
 naukari kii baat unke alaava koi or nahin samajhegaa
 Neither the leader nor the media
 phir bhi ham naukari series par laut rahe hai
 It is really being unfair to the youth
 jis vakt noujvaan naukari maang rahe hai, us vakt koi unki naukari kii baat nahin kar rahaa he
 The job is only on hoarding during elections
 ham koshish karenge ki apane simit sansadhano ke sahare ki alag-alag rajyon main phir se laut kar denkhenge ki jwining letters milane main kyon deree ho rahi he, kitni deree ho rahi he, vigyaapan nikalne ke baad pariksha main deree kyon ho rahi he, aap naujavaanon se ummid he ki primetimewithravish@gmail
 Send in detail on com and write your number
 ham sabhi kii samasyaayein to nahin dikhaa paaenge, yah baat abhi kahana zaruri bhi he, magar koshish hogi ki jiskaa dayera bada hoga, ham dikhaaenge
 Its effect will be only when you are more interested in the matter of others than you, otherwise you will see with the intention of seeing your own, the system will not matter
 banaras kaa ek chaatr hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ke paas aayaa
 He claims that he had passed the examination of the staff selection but the information of passing did not arrive in time and he could not get the document checked
 uskaa rank 12waan tha, iske baad bhi vah naukari se rah gaya
 This boy named Akash Pandey is wandering here and there
 ab uske kaam na to hindu muslim vaale aa rahe hai na bhagwaan
 Went to court
 magar is vakt sthiti yah he ki akaash ko naukari nahin mili
 After passing the Junior Wireless Officer examination, even after coming in 12th rank, the job was not found due to not getting timely information
 51 padon ke liye isaki pariksha 18 november ko hui
 This boy passed in it
 akaash ko laga ki esayssi kii taraf se soochna aegi
 He kept checking regular SMS and email
 bich bich main website bhi check kar letaa tha
 After several days, when Akash visited the website, his senses flew away
 riselt nikal chukaa tha or sari tareekhen ja chuki thim
 Akash claims that when he asked for information through RTI from the Staff Selection Commission, he got the answer that the information was given on the website for a short time, you should have seen this is your mistake
 thode samay kii soochna kaa kya matlab he
 After this, Akash started to find here and there
 paas hue chaatro se poocha to pataa laga ki unhen email bhi aayaa tha or esemes bhi aayaa tha
 But Akash claims that he neither received an SMS nor received an email notification
 51 padon kii bahaali main 12waan rank laakar bhi akaash aaj samaj nahin paa rahaa he ki uske saath aisa kyon hua
 If there was a lapse, was it such a big case that it cannot be fixed
 aadha se adhik may biit gaya lekin kya aapako pataa he ki march ke maheene main staff salection kamishan kii pariksha kii sibiai jaanch kaa kya nateeja niklaa he
 Media reports show that on March 27, the UP Police Special Task Force and Delhi Police together arrested four people
 tab inke paas se 50 lakh rupee bhi baraamad hue the
 What progress has been made beyond this, at which stage the CBI investigation is not public information
 march bhar esayssi kii pariksha main prashn patron ke li hone kaa maamla jor shor se uthaa, wo bhi isliye ki chaatr kai dinon tak staff salection kamishan ke daftar ke baahar badi sankhya main jamaa hue
 Leaders of Congress, BJP and Swaraj India kept coming among them
 6 march ko grahamantri rajnath singh ne sibiai jaanch ke aadesh bhi die
 The students were demanding that a large number of question papers were leaked in the examinations that took place between February 17 and February 22 this year
 chaatr jaanch kii report kaa intazaar kar rahe the ki khabar ai ki staff salection kamishan ke chairman aseem khurana kaa kaarykaal ek saal ke liye badha diya gaya he
 There is no relation between the two, provided the question papers are leaked
 baharhaal is baat ko lekar chaatro main naaraazgi he
 Anupam of Swaraj India has issued a statement criticizing the extension of Khurana's tenure
 naukari series ke pehle charan main hamane dikhaaya tha ki siechaesel 2015 or sijiel 2016 kii pariksha main paas kiye chaatro ko paas karne ke baad bhi jwining letters nahin mil rahaa he
 How many thousand students have joined the joining letter after the series? Since last week, 1000 students are joining the post of Assistant Audit Officer at CAG
 jaise jaise jwine karte hai, hamen shukriya kaa sandesh bhej dete hai
 i wish this had happened to everyone
 kyon abhi bhi siechaesel 2015 ke kai chaatro ko jwining letters nahin mila he
 They say that many departments have given appointment letters, students have also joined, but there are still some departments who are not giving appointment letters
 phone par pataa karne se bolte hai ki july agast main niyukti hogi
 Tell us the result came in August 2017 and it will take one year to get the appointment
 isi ke saath ab ve chaatr pareshaan hai jinhone sijiel 2016 kii pariksha di he, rigelt aa gaya he magar niyukti patr nahin mil rahaa he
 The notification for the exam we are talking about came out in October 2016
 6708 padon ke liye vigyaapan niklaa tha
 There were 3295 posts for Postal Assistant and 2878 for LDC
 do-do saal to pariksha chalati rahati he
 Why does this happen to the expectations of young people
 staff salection kamishan kii website se pataa chalata he ki rigelt isi 16 farvari ko niklaa he, may maheene main ise rivaaiz kiya gaya he
 We have emailed SSC for an answer, when it comes or if it will show, but how will thousands of students continue to fall prey to the slow pace of the system
 ye chaatr itane darpok hai yaa kah lijie ki ghabaraae hue hai ki apana video tak banaakar nahin bhej pate hai
 There are thousands of students, their demand is also valid, but if we do not come forward then we will show how
 kuch chaatro ne audio recording bheji he
 The comments aap darshakon ko pataa he ki ham lagaataar bank series kar rahe the
 Left in the middle because the thing was not moving forward
 kuch bainkon ne mahila bankeron ke liye shauchalay banane ke aadesh die hai
 Now it is already time that a toilet should be built
 kaam karne ke halaat, tanaavon ke bahaane bankeron kii mul maang selary bhi he isliye ham in baton ke zarie unke bheetar jhaank kar dekhnaa chaahate the, isliye hamaare liye cross sailing ke alaava chuttee na milanaa, mahila bankeron ke tabadale main unki chintaa kii parvaah na karnaa, mahila ho yaa purush banker, inke biimaar padane yaa ghar waalon ke biimaar padane par chuttee na milanaa, ye sab baaten bhi mahatvapurn hai
 We also noticed that some bankers were also attacked in the meantime
 khudakushi kii bhi khabaren ain
 There is not much good within the banking world
 21 may ko bihar ke araval main bank aaf baroda main manager pad par tainaat alok chander kii goli maar kar hatya kar di gai
 He was hit by three abuses
 alok navada ke varasaliganj thane ke kutary gaanv ke rahane vaale the
 In protest against this murder, bank employees took out a candle march in Muzaffarpur
 haal hi main jaipur main bankeron ne apni suraksha or anya maangon ko lekar dharna diya tha
 The bank series will also return, provided the bankers continue to tell us the inside things honestly

 They are telling the public not to go to another party rally because Omprakash ji will curse and when he curses, he will get jaundice
 hamaare netaaon ko vaigyanik prashikshan kii sakht zarurat he
 At least Om Prakash Rajbhar should go to the National Health Portal of the Government of India where the reasons for jaundice have been explained
 un kaarnon main kahin nahin likhaa he ki omprakash rajbhar ke shraap dene se pilia kii beemaari hoti he
 Not only this, after getting jaundice, Rajbhar ji also gives medicines to recover, from which lab is that medicine available, only he can tell
 bharat kii raajnneeti main netaa kuch bhi bol kar nikal jate hai
 This confidence of him should be praised
 koi vipaksh ke netaa ko kutta billi saanp chhuchhuundar kah detaa he, koi rajyapal ko kutta kah detaa he
 If someone can see the origin of plastic surgery in Ganesh ji, then one can see everything in today's world in an era for which evidence has never been found

 The term jaundice is used to refer to yellowing of the skin and whitening of the eyes
 iskaa kaaran sharir ke utakon va rakt main ek padaarth kaa nirmaan hota he, jise billirubin kehete hai
 Any condition due to which the activity of bilirubin is obstructed by blood from the liver and outside the body
 uske kaaran pilia hota he
 Bilirubin is a yellow pigment formed by the breakdown of dead red blood cells in the liver
 iske alaava kai anya tareeke hai jinke madhyam se billirubin banataa he
 It is not written anywhere that jaundice is caused by Omprakash Rajbhar's curse or jaundice is caused by cursing when he goes to any rally without his permission

 i show a cruel example of how much we have failed in scientific and humanism
 sirf sansthaaen hi nahin, samaaj main bhi krurta kii itani paraten hai ki maanavtawaad or bhaichara kahaan khatm ho gaya he yaa iske khatm hone kaa pramaan kis rup main kab hamaare saamne aa jayega ham nahin jaanate
 Think, what would have been the crime, what could have been the reason for hating this person so much that he is being tied and killed in this way
 gujarat ke rajkot kii ek factory se mila yah video he jise vidhayak jignesh mewaani ne twit kiya tha
 The man who is being killed has died
 police kii shikaayat ke anusaar auto part kii factory ke maalik ke aadesh par ise is tarah baandh kar maaraa gaya
 His wife was also killed
 mukesh vania cheekhta rahaa, chillaata rahaa magar maarane waalon par koi fark nahin padaa
 Jignesh told that Mukesh Vaniya is from Dalit community
 ye aaj ke hindustan kii tasviir he
 Even after how much debate took place in 2016 after the Una incident in Gujarat, there was no difference within the society
 jati yaa amir hone kaa ahankaar itnaa bada kaise ho jaataa he ki ek manushya ko is tarah baandh kar maaraa jaataa he
 Mukesh's wife somehow ran away, asking for help from the villagers, but by the time she returned, Mukesh was lying on the floor
 astapatal le jate jate uski maut ho chuki thi
 a case under murder and SC / ST Act has been registered against the five people who killed it
 inke naam hai chiraag vora, divyesh vora, jaysukh radadia, tejas jaala
 The fifth accused is under 18 years of age but has also been detained
 police donon pakshon ke daawey kii jaanch kar rahi he magar mukesh vania kii maut ho gai he
 There is no need to investigate for this
 yah koi pehali ghatana nahin he, haal philhal ke dinon main hi desh bhar main itani ghatnaayen ho chuki hai jo bataati hai ki ek tabaka lagaataar bada hota ja rahaa he jisane jati or dharm ke aadhaar par ek khaas tabake ko bardaasht na karne kii zid thaan lee he
 We are seeing this result of the politics of spreading hate in the name of caste and religion
 21 march 2018 ke times of india main ek khabar chhapi thi
 An RTI reply by a Dalit activist from Mehsana revealed that Gujarat had 1515 cases registered in the year 2017, the highest in the past 17 years
 aaj hi amit shah karnataka main dalit utpeedan kii baat kar rahe the
 Which will also be right, but can they talk about Gujarat
 enciarabi ke data ke hisaab se dalit utpeedan main gujarat kaa sthaan 10 he or karnataka kaa 6
 Which state does not have this hatred and which political ideology is getting this hate from people
 badhaava mil rahaa he
 There has been a lot of talk of the danger of democracy during the Karnataka elections
 magar aapako koi netaa khatare main nahin dikhegaa
 Public remains in danger jab bhi aap akele hote hai, bheed se alag, aapako pataa chalata he ki aap khatare main hai, loktantr kii baat karne vaale netaa nahin

 Nevertheless, we are returning to the job series

 At the time when young people are seeking jobs, no one is talking about their jobs
 naukari kii baat sirf chunaavon ke samay hording par hoti he

 a student from Banaras came to our colleague Ajay Singh
 uskaa daawa he ki usne staff salection kii pariksha paas to kar lee thi magar paas hone kii soochna samay se nahin pahunchi or wo document kii jaanch nahin kara paaya
 His rank was 12th, even after that he remained in the job
 akaash pandeya naam kaa yah ladkaa yahaan vahaan bhatak rahaa he
 Now neither Hindu nor Muslim are coming to his work
 court main gaya he
 But this time the situation is that Akash did not get a job
 junior wireles officer kii pariksha paas karne ke baad, 12wein rank par aane ke baad bhi samay par soochna nahin milane ke kaaran naukari nahin mili
 Its examination for 51 posts took place on 18 November
 isamen ye ladkaa paas kar gaya
 Akash felt that information would come from SSC
 wo regular esemes or email check karata rahaa
 Also used to check the website periodically
 kai dinon baad akaash ne jab website dekhi to uske hosh ud gaye
 The result was out and all the dates were gone
 akaash kaa daawa he ki jab usne staff salection kamishan se artiai ke zarie soochna maangi to jawaab mila ki website par thode samay ke liye soochna di gai thi, aapako dekhnaa chahie tha ye aapaki galati he
 What does short notice mean? iske baad akaash yahaan vahaan pataa karne laga
 When asked the nearby students, they came to know that they had received an email and an SMS
 magar akaash kaa daawa he ki use na to esemes aayaa na email se soochna mili
 Even by bringing 12th rank in the restoration of 51 posts, Akash is unable to understand why this happened to him
 agar koi chook thi to kya yah itnaa bada maamla tha jise thik nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 More than half of May has passed, but do you know what the result of the CBI investigation of the Staff Selection Commission examination in the month of March has been
 media kii khabaron se pataa chalata he ki 27 march ko upi police ke special task force or dilli police ne milakar chaar logon ko giraftaar kiya tha
 Then 50 lakh rupees were also recovered from them
 iske aage kya pragati hui he, sibiai kii jaanch kis str par saarvajanik jaankaree nahin he
 The matter of leaking of question papers in the SSC examination throughout March was raised with great noise, because the students gathered in large numbers outside the Staff Selection Commission office for several days
 congress, bijepi or swaraj india ke netaa inke bich aate jate rahe
 On 6 March, Home Minister Rajnath Singh also ordered a CBI inquiry
 chaatro kii maang thi ki is saal 17 farvari se 22 farvari ke bich jo parikshaayen hui thim, unamem bade paimaane par prashn patr li hue hai
 The students were waiting for the report of the inquiry when the news came that the staff selection commission chairman Aseem Khurana's tenure has been extended by one year
 donon main koi sambandh nahin he basharte prashn patron ke li hone kii jaanch ho jaati
 However, there is anger among the students about this
 swaraj india ke anupam ne bayaan jari kar khurana ke kaarykaal badaye jane kii aalochana kii he
 In the first phase of the job series, we had shown that students who passed the CHSL 2015 and CGL 2016 exams are not getting the joining letter even after passing
 series ke baad kai hazaar chaatro ko jwining letters mila he? pichley hafte se sieji main assistant audit afasar ke pad par 1000 chaatro kii jwining ho rahi he
 As soon as we join, send us a message of thanks
 kaash sabake saath aisa ho jaataa
 Why many students of CHSL 2015 still have not received the joining letter
 inkaa kahana he ki kai vibhaagon ne niyukti patr to de die, chaatro ne jwine bhi kar liya magar abhi bhi kuch vibhaag aise hai jo niyukti patr nahin de rahe hai
 Address on the phone says that the appointment will be in july-august
 bataaiye agast 2017 main rigelt aayaa or ek saal lagegaa niyukti hone main
 With this, now those students are upset who have given the CGL 2016 exam, the result has come but the appointment letter is not being received

 Some students have sent audio recordings
 tippaniyan You viewers know that we were doing bank series continuously

 Some banks have ordered to construct toilets for women bankers
 ab itnaa vakt to ho hi chukaa he ki shauchalay ban janaa chahie
 The basic demand of bankers is also salary due to working conditions, stresses, so we wanted to look into them through these things, so we do not care about the holiday in addition to cross selling, worrying about the transfer of women bankers Doing it, whether it is a female or a male banker, not getting discharged if they fall ill or the family members get sick, all these things are also important
 hamane yah bhi dekha ki is bich kuch bankeron par hamale bhi hue
 There were also reports of suicide
 banking duniya ke bheetar kaaphi kuch acha nahin he
 On 21 May, Alok Chander, who was posted as manager at the Bank of Baroda in Arwal, Bihar, was shot dead
 unhen teen gaaliyon maari gayi
 Alok was a resident of Kutri village of Warsaliganj police station of Nawada
 is hatya ke virodh main bank karmchaariyon ne muzaffarpur main candal march nikaala

 The reason for this is the formation of a substance in the body's tissues and blood, which is called bilirubin
 koi bhi sthiti jinke kaaran billirubin kii gatividhiyaan rakt se liver or sharir se baahar baadhit hoti hai
 It causes jaundice
 billirubin pile rang kaa pigment he, jo ki liver main mrit laal rakt koshikaon ke tuutane se banataa he
 Apart from this, there are many other ways through which bilirubin is formed

 sochie, aisa kya gunaah rahaa hoga iskaa, is vyakti se itani nafrat hone kii kya vajah rahi hogi ki is tarah se baandh kar maaraa ja rahaa he
 This is a video from a factory in Rajkot, Gujarat, which was tweeted by MLA Jignesh Mevani
 yah aadmi jise maaraa ja rahaa he, wo mar gaya
 According to the police complaint, on the orders of the owner of the auto part factory, it was tied and killed like this
 isaki patni ko bhi maaraa gaya
 Mukesh Vaniya shouted, kept shouting but there was no difference to those who killed him
 jignesh ne bataaya ki mukesh vania dalit samudaay se he
 This is a picture of today's India
 2016 main gujarat main oona kii ghatana ke baad kitni bahes hui uske baad bhi samaaj ke bheetar koi fark nahin padaa
 How does the ego of caste or getting rich become so big that a human being is tied and killed like this
 mukesh kii patni kisi tarah bhaagi, gaanv waalon se madad maangi lekin jab tak vah lauti, mukesh zamin par adhamra padaa tha
 He had died while carrying him to the hospital
 isaki jaan lene vaale paanch logon ke khilaaf hatya or essi / asti act ke tahat mukadmaa darj kiya gaya he
 His names are Chirag Vora, Divyesh Vora, Jaisukh Radadia, Tejas Zala
 paanchavaa abhiyukt 18 saal se kam kaa he magar use bhi hiraasat main liya gaya he
 Police are investigating the claims of both the sides but Mukesh Vaniya has died
 iske liye jaanch kii koi zarurat nahin he
 This is not the first incident, in recent times, there have been so many incidents across the country which show that a section is becoming increasingly large which has determined not to tolerate a particular section on the basis of caste and religion
 Have taken jati or dharm ke naam par nafrat failaane kii raajnneeti kaa yah nateeja ham dekh rahe hai
 a news was published in the Times of India on 21 March 2018
 mehsana ke ek dalit kaaryakarta ke artiai ke jawaab main jaankaree saamne ai ki gujarat main 2017 ke saal main 1515 maamle darj hue the jo pichley 17 saal main sabase adhik tha
 Today, Amit Shah was talking about the oppression of Dalits in Karnataka
 jo ki sahi bhi hoga, magar kya ve gujarat kii baat kar sakate hai
 According to NCRB data, Gujarat ranks 10 and Karnataka 6 in Dalit oppression
 kis rajya main yah nafrat nahin he or is nafrat ko kis raajnneetik vichaardhaara ke logon se prashray mil rahaa he
 It is getting a boost
 karnataka chunaavon ke dauraan loktantr ke khatare kii khub baat hui he
 But you will not see any leader in danger
 khatare main to lok rahata he
 Whenever you are alone, apart from the crowd, you realize that you are in danger, not a leader talking about democracy
 duniya main chaahe jitani badi braking news ho jaae, noujvaan har din yahi massej karte hai ki naukari series par kab lautenge
 Talk about our job
 magar yahi noujvaan nafrat kii raajnneeti main jalaavan ke kaam bhi aa rahe hai
 It is difficult to understand what is the priority of the youth
 ve is vakt nafrat kii baat zyaada soch rahe hai yaa naukari kii baat zyaada soch rahe hai
 Hopefully they will understand the words of hate
 naukari kii baat unke alaava koi or nahin samajhegaa
 Neither the leader nor the media
 phir bhi ham naukari series par laut rahe hai
 It is really being unfair to the youth
 jis vakt noujvaan naukari maang rahe hai, us vakt koi unki naukari kii baat nahin kar rahaa he
 The job is only on hoarding during elections
 ham koshish karenge ki apane simit sansadhano ke sahare ki alag-alag rajyon main phir se laut kar denkhenge ki jwining letters milane main kyon deree ho rahi he, kitni deree ho rahi he, vigyaapan nikalne ke baad pariksha main deree kyon ho rahi he, aap naujavaanon se ummid he ki primetimewithravish@gmail

 banaras kaa ek chaatr hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ke paas aayaa
 He claims that he had passed the examination of the staff selection but the information of passing did not arrive in time and he could not get the document checked
 uskaa rank 12waan tha, iske baad bhi vah naukari se rah gaya
 This boy named Akash Pandey is wandering here and there
 ab uske kaam na to hindu muslim vaale aa rahe hai na bhagwaan
 Went to court
 magar is vakt sthiti yah he ki akaash ko naukari nahin mili
 After passing the Junior Wireless Officer examination, even after coming in 12th rank, the job was not found due to not getting timely information
 51 padon ke liye isaki pariksha 18 november ko hui
 This boy passed in it
 akaash ko laga ki esayssi kii taraf se soochna aegi
 He kept checking regular SMS and email
 bich bich main website bhi check kar letaa tha
 After several days, when Akash visited the website, his senses flew away
 riselt nikal chukaa tha or sari tareekhen ja chuki thim
 Akash claims that when he asked for information through RTI from the Staff Selection Commission, he got the answer that the information was given on the website for a short time, you should have seen this is your mistake
 thode samay kii soochna kaa kya matlab he
 After this, Akash started to find here and there
 paas hue chaatro se poocha to pataa laga ki unhen email bhi aayaa tha or esemes bhi aayaa tha
 But Akash claims that he neither received an SMS nor received an email notification
 51 padon kii bahaali main 12waan rank laakar bhi akaash aaj samaj nahin paa rahaa he ki uske saath aisa kyon hua
 If there was a lapse, was it such a big case that it cannot be fixed
 aadha se adhik may biit gaya lekin kya aapako pataa he ki march ke maheene main staff salection kamishan kii pariksha kii sibiai jaanch kaa kya nateeja niklaa he
 Media reports show that on March 27, the UP Police Special Task Force and Delhi Police together arrested four people
 tab inke paas se 50 lakh rupee bhi baraamad hue the
 What progress has been made beyond this, at which stage the CBI investigation is not public information
 march bhar esayssi kii pariksha main prashn patron ke li hone kaa maamla jor shor se uthaa, wo bhi isliye ki chaatr kai dinon tak staff salection kamishan ke daftar ke baahar badi sankhya main jamaa hue
 Leaders of Congress, BJP and Swaraj India kept coming among them
 6 march ko grahamantri rajnath singh ne sibiai jaanch ke aadesh bhi die
 The students were demanding that a large number of question papers were leaked in the examinations that took place between February 17 and February 22 this year
 chaatr jaanch kii report kaa intazaar kar rahe the ki khabar ai ki staff salection kamishan ke chairman aseem khurana kaa kaarykaal ek saal ke liye badha diya gaya he
 There is no relation between the two, provided the question papers are leaked
 baharhaal is baat ko lekar chaatro main naaraazgi he
 Anupam of Swaraj India has issued a statement criticizing the extension of Khurana's tenure
 naukari series ke pehle charan main hamane dikhaaya tha ki siechaesel 2015 or sijiel 2016 kii pariksha main paas kiye chaatro ko paas karne ke baad bhi jwining letters nahin mil rahaa he
 How many thousand students have joined the joining letter after the series? Since last week, 1000 students are joining the post of Assistant Audit Officer at CAG
 jaise jaise jwine karte hai, hamen shukriya kaa sandesh bhej dete hai
 i wish this had happened to everyone
 kyon abhi bhi siechaesel 2015 ke kai chaatro ko jwining letters nahin mila he
 They say that many departments have given appointment letters, students have also joined, but there are still some departments who are not giving appointment letters
 phone par pataa karne se bolte hai ki july agast main niyukti hogi
 Tell us the result came in August 2017 and it will take one year to get the appointment
 isi ke saath ab ve chaatr pareshaan hai jinhone sijiel 2016 kii pariksha di he, rigelt aa gaya he magar niyukti patr nahin mil rahaa he
 The notification for the exam we are talking about came out in October 2016
 6708 padon ke liye vigyaapan niklaa tha
 There were 3295 posts for Postal Assistant and 2878 for LDC
 do-do saal to pariksha chalati rahati he
 Why does this happen to the expectations of young people
 staff salection kamishan kii website se pataa chalata he ki rigelt isi 16 farvari ko niklaa he, may maheene main ise rivaaiz kiya gaya he
 We have emailed SSC for an answer, when it comes or if it will show, but how will thousands of students continue to fall prey to the slow pace of the system
 ye chaatr itane darpok hai yaa kah lijie ki ghabaraae hue hai ki apana video tak banaakar nahin bhej pate hai
 There are thousands of students, their demand is also valid, but if we do not come forward then we will show how
 kuch chaatro ne audio recording bheji he
 The comments aap darshakon ko pataa he ki ham lagaataar bank series kar rahe the
 Left in the middle because the thing was not moving forward
 kuch bainkon ne mahila bankeron ke liye shauchalay banane ke aadesh die hai
 Now it is already time that a toilet should be built
 kaam karne ke halaat, tanaavon ke bahaane bankeron kii mul maang selary bhi he isliye ham in baton ke zarie unke bheetar jhaank kar dekhnaa chaahate the, isliye hamaare liye cross sailing ke alaava chuttee na milanaa, mahila bankeron ke tabadale main unki chintaa kii parvaah na karnaa, mahila ho yaa purush banker, inke biimaar padane yaa ghar waalon ke biimaar padane par chuttee na milanaa, ye sab baaten bhi mahatvapurn hai
 We also noticed that some bankers were also attacked in the meantime
 khudakushi kii bhi khabaren ain
 There is not much good within the banking world
 21 may ko bihar ke araval main bank aaf baroda main manager pad par tainaat alok chander kii goli maar kar hatya kar di gai
 He was hit by three abuses
 alok navada ke varasaliganj thane ke kutary gaanv ke rahane vaale the
 In protest against this murder, bank employees took out a candle march in Muzaffarpur
 haal hi main jaipur main bankeron ne apni suraksha or anya maangon ko lekar dharna diya tha
 The bank series will also return, provided the bankers continue to tell us the inside things honestly

 i show a cruel example of how much we have failed in scientific and humanism
 sirf sansthaaen hi nahin, samaaj main bhi krurta kii itani paraten hai ki maanavtawaad or bhaichara kahaan khatm ho gaya he yaa iske khatm hone kaa pramaan kis rup main kab hamaare saamne aa jayega ham nahin jaanate
 Think, what would have been the crime, what could have been the reason for hating this person so much that he is being tied and killed in this way
 gujarat ke rajkot kii ek factory se mila yah video he jise vidhayak jignesh mewaani ne twit kiya tha
 The man who is being killed has died
 police kii shikaayat ke anusaar auto part kii factory ke maalik ke aadesh par ise is tarah baandh kar maaraa gaya
 His wife was also killed
 mukesh vania cheekhta rahaa, chillaata rahaa magar maarane waalon par koi fark nahin padaa
 Jignesh told that Mukesh Vaniya is from Dalit community
 ye aaj ke hindustan kii tasviir he
 Even after how much debate took place in 2016 after the Una incident in Gujarat, there was no difference within the society
 jati yaa amir hone kaa ahankaar itnaa bada kaise ho jaataa he ki ek manushya ko is tarah baandh kar maaraa jaataa he
 Mukesh's wife somehow ran away, asking for help from the villagers, but by the time she returned, Mukesh was lying on the floor
 astapatal le jate jate uski maut ho chuki thi
 a case under murder and SC / ST Act has been registered against the five people who killed it
 inke naam hai chiraag vora, divyesh vora, jaysukh radadia, tejas jaala
 The fifth accused is under 18 years of age but has also been detained
 police donon pakshon ke daawey kii jaanch kar rahi he magar mukesh vania kii maut ho gai he
 There is no need to investigate for this
 yah koi pehali ghatana nahin he, haal philhal ke dinon main hi desh bhar main itani ghatnaayen ho chuki hai jo bataati hai ki ek tabaka lagaataar bada hota ja rahaa he jisane jati or dharm ke aadhaar par ek khaas tabake ko bardaasht na karne kii zid thaan lee he
 We are seeing this result of the politics of spreading hate in the name of caste and religion
 21 march 2018 ke times of india main ek khabar chhapi thi
 An RTI reply by a Dalit activist from Mehsana revealed that Gujarat had 1515 cases registered in the year 2017, the highest in the past 17 years
 aaj hi amit shah karnataka main dalit utpeedan kii baat kar rahe the
 Which will also be right, but can they talk about Gujarat
 enciarabi ke data ke hisaab se dalit utpeedan main gujarat kaa sthaan 10 he or karnataka kaa 6
 Which state does not have this hatred and which political ideology is getting this hate from people
 badhaava mil rahaa he
 There has been a lot of talk of the danger of democracy during the Karnataka elections
 magar aapako koi netaa khatare main nahin dikhegaa
 Public remains in danger jab bhi aap akele hote hai, bheed se alag, aapako pataa chalata he ki aap khatare main hai, loktantr kii baat karne vaale netaa nahin
 No matter how big the breaking news is in the world, every day youngsters make the message that when will they return to the job series
 hamaari naukari kii baat kiijie
 But the same youth are also using firewood in the politics of hate
 samajhnaa mushkil he ki naujavaanon kii praathamikta kya he
 They are thinking more of hate at the moment or are thinking more about jobs
 ummid he ve nafrat kii baton ko samajhenge
 No one else will understand the job
 na netaa na media
 Nevertheless, we are returning to the job series
 naujavaanon ke saath vaaki ninsaphi ho rahi he
 At the time when young people are seeking jobs, no one is talking about their jobs
 naukari kii baat sirf chunaavon ke samay hording par hoti he
 We will try to return to different states again with the help of our limited resources to see why there is a delay in getting the joining letter, how much it is delayed, why the examination is delayed after the advertisement is out, you Youngsters are expected primetimewithravish @ gmail

 Please provide your number sochie, aisa kya gunaah rahaa hoga iskaa, is vyakti se itani nafrat hone kii kya vajah rahi hogi ki is tarah se baandh kar maaraa ja rahaa he
 This is a video from a factory in Rajkot, Gujarat, which was tweeted by MLA Jignesh Mevani
 yah aadmi jise maaraa ja rahaa he, wo mar gaya
 According to the police complaint, on the orders of the owner of the auto part factory, it was tied and killed like this
 isaki patni ko bhi maaraa gaya
 Mukesh Vaniya shouted, kept shouting but there was no difference to those who killed him
 jignesh ne bataaya ki mukesh vania dalit samudaay se he
 This is a picture of today's India
 2016 main gujarat main oona kii ghatana ke baad kitni bahes hui uske baad bhi samaaj ke bheetar koi fark nahin padaa
 How does the ego of caste or getting rich become so big that a human being is tied and killed like this
 mukesh kii patni kisi tarah bhaagi, gaanv waalon se madad maangi lekin jab tak vah lauti, mukesh zamin par adhamra padaa tha
 He had died while carrying him to the hospital
 isaki jaan lene vaale paanch logon ke khilaaf hatya or essi / asti act ke tahat mukadmaa darj kiya gaya he
 His names are Chirag Vora, Divyesh Vora, Jaisukh Radadia, Tejas Zala
 paanchavaa abhiyukt 18 saal se kam kaa he magar use bhi hiraasat main liya gaya he
 Police are investigating the claims of both the sides but Mukesh Vaniya has died
 iske liye jaanch kii koi zarurat nahin he
 This is not the first incident, in recent times, there have been so many incidents across the country which show that a section is becoming increasingly large which has determined not to tolerate a particular section on the basis of caste and religion

 No matter how big the breaking news is in the world, every day youngsters make the message that when will they return to the job series
 hamaari naukari kii baat kiijie
 But the same youth are also using firewood in the politics of hate
 samajhnaa mushkil he ki naujavaanon kii praathamikta kya he
 They are thinking more of hate at the moment or are thinking more about jobs
 ummid he ve nafrat kii baton ko samajhenge
 No one else will understand the job
 na netaa na media
 Nevertheless, we are returning to the job series
 naujavaanon ke saath vaaki ninsaphi ho rahi he
 At the time when young people are seeking jobs, no one is talking about their jobs
 naukari kii baat sirf chunaavon ke samay hording par hoti he
 We will try to return to different states again with the help of our limited resources to see why there is a delay in getting the joining letter, how much it is delayed, why the examination is delayed after the advertisement is out, you Youngsters are expected primetimewithravish @ gmail
 com par vistaar se bhejein or apana number zarur likhie
 We will not be able to show everyone's problems, it is still necessary to say this, but it will be an effort that whose scope will be bigger, we will show
 iskaa asar tabhi hoga jab aap apane se zyaada duusare ke maamle main dilchaspee lenge, varna apana apana dekhne ke iraade se aap hi dekhenge, system ko koi fark nahin padegaa
 a student from Banaras came to our colleague Ajay Singh
 uskaa daawa he ki usne staff salection kii pariksha paas to kar lee thi magar paas hone kii soochna samay se nahin pahunchi or wo document kii jaanch nahin kara paaya
 His rank was 12th, even after that he remained in the job
 akaash pandeya naam kaa yah ladkaa yahaan vahaan bhatak rahaa he
 Now neither Hindu nor Muslim are coming to his work
 court main gaya he
 But this time the situation is that Akash did not get a job
 junior wireles officer kii pariksha paas karne ke baad, 12wein rank par aane ke baad bhi samay par soochna nahin milane ke kaaran naukari nahin mili
 Its examination for 51 posts took place on 18 November
 isamen ye ladkaa paas kar gaya
 Akash felt that information would come from SSC
 wo regular esemes or email check karata rahaa
 Also used to check the website periodically
 kai dinon baad akaash ne jab website dekhi to uske hosh ud gaye
 The result was out and all the dates were gone
 akaash kaa daawa he ki jab usne staff salection kamishan se artiai ke zarie soochna maangi to jawaab mila ki website par thode samay ke liye soochna di gai thi, aapako dekhnaa chahie tha ye aapaki galati he
 What does short notice mean? iske baad akaash yahaan vahaan pataa karne laga
 When asked the nearby students, they came to know that they had received an email and an SMS
 magar akaash kaa daawa he ki use na to esemes aayaa na email se soochna mili
 Even by bringing 12th rank in the restoration of 51 posts, Akash is unable to understand why this happened to him
 agar koi chook thi to kya yah itnaa bada maamla tha jise thik nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 More than half of May has passed, but do you know what the result of the CBI investigation of the Staff Selection Commission examination in the month of March has been
 media kii khabaron se pataa chalata he ki 27 march ko upi police ke special task force or dilli police ne milakar chaar logon ko giraftaar kiya tha
 Then 50 lakh rupees were also recovered from them
 iske aage kya pragati hui he, sibiai kii jaanch kis str par saarvajanik jaankaree nahin he
 The matter of leaking of question papers in the SSC examination throughout March was raised with great noise, because the students gathered in large numbers outside the Staff Selection Commission office for several days
 congress, bijepi or swaraj india ke netaa inke bich aate jate rahe
 On 6 March, Home Minister Rajnath Singh also ordered a CBI inquiry
 chaatro kii maang thi ki is saal 17 farvari se 22 farvari ke bich jo parikshaayen hui thim, unamem bade paimaane par prashn patr li hue hai
 The students were waiting for the report of the inquiry when the news came that the staff selection commission chairman Aseem Khurana's tenure has been extended by one year
 donon main koi sambandh nahin he basharte prashn patron ke li hone kii jaanch ho jaati
 However, there is anger among the students about this
 swaraj india ke anupam ne bayaan jari kar khurana ke kaarykaal badaye jane kii aalochana kii he
 In the first phase of the job series, we had shown that students who passed the CHSL 2015 and CGL 2016 exams are not getting the joining letter even after passing
 series ke baad kai hazaar chaatro ko jwining letters mila he? pichley hafte se sieji main assistant audit afasar ke pad par 1000 chaatro kii jwining ho rahi he
 As soon as we join, send us a message of thanks
 kaash sabake saath aisa ho jaataa
 Why many students of CHSL 2015 still have not received the joining letter
 inkaa kahana he ki kai vibhaagon ne niyukti patr to de die, chaatro ne jwine bhi kar liya magar abhi bhi kuch vibhaag aise hai jo niyukti patr nahin de rahe hai
 Address on the phone says that the appointment will be in july-august
 bataaiye agast 2017 main rigelt aayaa or ek saal lagegaa niyukti hone main
 With this, now those students are upset who have given the CGL 2016 exam, the result has come but the appointment letter is not being received
 ham jis pariksha kii baat kar rahe hai uskaa notification oktober 2016 main niklaa tha
 Advertisement was issued for 6708 posts
 postal sahaayak ke liye 3295 or eldisi ke liye 2878 pad the
 The exam goes on for two years
 naujavaanon kii ummiido ke saath aisa kyon hota he
 The Staff Selection Commission website shows that the result was released on February 16, it has been revised in May
 hamane esayssi ko jawaab ke liye email kiya he, jab aayega yaa agar aayega to dikhaaenge magar hazaron kii sankhya main chaatr system ke dhimi gati ke shikaar hote rahenge to kaise chalegaa
 These students are so timid or say that they are nervous that they cannot even make their videos
 hazaron kii sankhya main chaatr hai, inaki maang bhi jaays he phir bhi agar saamne nahin aaenge to ham dikhaaenge kaise
 Some students have sent audio recordings
 tippaniyan You viewers know that we were doing bank series continuously
 bich main chhod diya kyonki baat aage bad nahin rahi thi
 Some banks have ordered to construct toilets for women bankers
 ab itnaa vakt to ho hi chukaa he ki shauchalay ban janaa chahie
 The basic demand of bankers is also salary due to working conditions, stresses, so we wanted to look into them through these things, so we do not care about the holiday in addition to cross selling, worrying about the transfer of women bankers Doing it, whether it is a female or a male banker, not getting discharged if they fall ill or the family members get sick, all these things are also important
 hamane yah bhi dekha ki is bich kuch bankeron par hamale bhi hue
 There were also reports of suicide
 banking duniya ke bheetar kaaphi kuch acha nahin he
 On 21 May, Alok Chander, who was posted as manager at the Bank of Baroda in Arwal, Bihar, was shot dead
 unhen teen gaaliyon maari gayi
 Alok was a resident of Kutri village of Warsaliganj police station of Nawada
 is hatya ke virodh main bank karmchaariyon ne muzaffarpur main candal march nikaala
 Recently, bankers staged a sit-in in Jaipur for their security and other demands

 After passing the Junior Wireless Officer examination, even after coming in 12th rank, the job was not found due to not getting timely information
 51 padon ke liye isaki pariksha 18 november ko hui
 This boy passed in it
 akaash ko laga ki esayssi kii taraf se soochna aegi
 He kept checking regular SMS and email
 bich bich main website bhi check kar letaa tha
 After several days, when Akash visited the website, his senses flew away
 riselt nikal chukaa tha or sari tareekhen ja chuki thim
 Akash claims that when he asked for information through RTI from the Staff Selection Commission, he got the answer that the information was given on the website for a short time, you should have seen this is your mistake
 thode samay kii soochna kaa kya matlab he
 After this, Akash started to find here and there
 paas hue chaatro se poocha to pataa laga ki unhen email bhi aayaa tha or esemes bhi aayaa tha
 But Akash claims that he neither received an SMS nor received an email notification
 51 padon kii bahaali main 12waan rank laakar bhi akaash aaj samaj nahin paa rahaa he ki uske saath aisa kyon hua
 If there was a lapse, was it such a big case that it cannot be fixed
 aadha se adhik may biit gaya lekin kya aapako pataa he ki march ke maheene main staff salection kamishan kii pariksha kii sibiai jaanch kaa kya nateeja niklaa he
 Media reports show that on March 27, the UP Police Special Task Force and Delhi Police together arrested four people
 tab inke paas se 50 lakh rupee bhi baraamad hue the
 What progress has been made beyond this, at which stage the CBI investigation is not public information

 Leaders of Congress, BJP and Swaraj India kept coming among them

 More than half of May has passed, but do you know what the result of the CBI investigation of the Staff Selection Commission examination in the month of March has been
 media kii khabaron se pataa chalata he ki 27 march ko upi police ke special task force or dilli police ne milakar chaar logon ko giraftaar kiya tha
 Then 50 lakh rupees were also recovered from them
 iske aage kya pragati hui he, sibiai kii jaanch kis str par saarvajanik jaankaree nahin he
 The matter of leaking of question papers in the SSC examination throughout March was raised with great noise, because the students gathered in large numbers outside the Staff Selection Commission office for several days
 congress, bijepi or swaraj india ke netaa inke bich aate jate rahe
 On 6 March, Home Minister Rajnath Singh also ordered a CBI inquiry
 chaatro kii maang thi ki is saal 17 farvari se 22 farvari ke bich jo parikshaayen hui thim, unamem bade paimaane par prashn patr li hue hai
 The students were waiting for the report of the inquiry when the news came that the staff selection commission chairman Aseem Khurana's tenure has been extended by one year
 donon main koi sambandh nahin he basharte prashn patron ke li hone kii jaanch ho jaati
 However, there is anger among the students about this
 swaraj india ke anupam ne bayaan jari kar khurana ke kaarykaal badaye jane kii aalochana kii he
 In the first phase of the job series, we had shown that students who passed the CHSL 2015 and CGL 2016 exams are not getting the joining letter even after passing
 series ke baad kai hazaar chaatro ko jwining letters mila he? pichley hafte se sieji main assistant audit afasar ke pad par 1000 chaatro kii jwining ho rahi he
 As soon as we join, send us a message of thanks
 kaash sabake saath aisa ho jaataa
 Why many students of CHSL 2015 still have not received the joining letter
 inkaa kahana he ki kai vibhaagon ne niyukti patr to de die, chaatro ne jwine bhi kar liya magar abhi bhi kuch vibhaag aise hai jo niyukti patr nahin de rahe hai
 Address on the phone says that the appointment will be in july-august
 bataaiye agast 2017 main rigelt aayaa or ek saal lagegaa niyukti hone main
 With this, now those students are upset who have given the CGL 2016 exam, the result has come but the appointment letter is not being received
 ham jis pariksha kii baat kar rahe hai uskaa notification oktober 2016 main niklaa tha
 Advertisement was issued for 6708 posts
 postal sahaayak ke liye 3295 or eldisi ke liye 2878 pad the
 The exam goes on for two years
 naujavaanon kii ummiido ke saath aisa kyon hota he
 The Staff Selection Commission website shows that the result was released on February 16, it has been revised in May
