 ek khatarnaak saaye kii tarah manoj bakkarwaala dilli kii sadakon par lagjri gadiyon kaa peechha karata he or kisi bhi pal bandook kii nonk par aisi kisi bhi gaadi ko lut saktaa he
 Flying of all kinds of new luxury cars had become his hobby
 police kii sirdardi ye ki bakkarwaala kabhi suraag nahin chodta
 The police found a clue that was related to his personal life
 beshkeemtee gadiyon par najaradilli ke bazaar main jaise hi koi nayi beshkeemtee gaadi utaari gayi vaise hi car jaikar manoj bakkarwaala ne usko hathiyaane kii sajeesh shuru kar di
 In which posh area of delhi, how many luxury cars are there, where the owners of the vehicles come and go, and where these cars are parked, there is hardly any chance of Bakkarwale in gathering these information
 misaal ke taur par kuch hafte pehle yani 15 june 2009 ko bakkarwaala ke gang ne gudgaanv kii ore rukh kiya or pehle se tay kii sajeesh ke tahat showrooms condishan kii nayi pajeron gaadi ko bandook kii nonk par saream lut liya
 The police was not afraid of the police, the loot of looting public expensive vehicles from the streets of Delhi has completely angered the Bakkarwala gang
 itnaa bekhauf ki jis bhi gaadi par najar gadi uski chaabi bandook kii nonk par paanch minute main uske paas aa gayi
 The manner in which the Bakkarwala gang loots the car at the point of the gun caused many vehicle owners to panic in such a way that they are afraid to write the report
 luute gayi kuch logon ne to is baat kaa shukr manaaya ki gaadi bhale hi lut gayi ho lekin bhala hua ki unhen goli nahin maari gayi
 Due to the trouble for the police, the police were also unable to commit this new type of crime happening in Delhi
 jurm or dehshat ke is naye badshaah par jaal phenkane ke liye police ke aalaa-afasaron ne tabadatod baithke shuru kar di
 In particular, the Elite Division Special Cell of Delhi Police was given the responsibility of capturing Manoj Bakkarwala
 dilli se nikalati mahangi lagjri gadiyon par police kii nigaraanee badha di gayi
 But the super jacker of cars does not leave a single mark on the spot after executing the crime
 wo itnaa shaatir he ki usne mobile phone se parhez kiya or apane giroh ko bhi phone par koi bhi baat karne kii pabandi laga di
 a personal clue came to hand, and he became fearless
 dilli to dilli uskaa giroh chandigarh main bandook kii nonk par car luutane laga
 On 22 June 2009, Bakkarwala flew a new Honda Accord in Chandigarh with a pistol
 dehshat ke is saaye kaa peechha karte-karte bakkarwaala kaa ek suraag police ke haath aayaa
 This clue was that of his sweetheart looking model-like, who was vowing to die with this dangerous gangster
 mahabuuba ke saath aksar mulaaqatempulice ko pataa laga ki apni haseen mahabuuba ke saath bakkarwaala discothek main thirak rahaa he
 The police also came to know that Bakkarwala frequently visits his Mehbooba
 police ke mandaraate khatre ke baavjood wo apni mahabuuba ko long drive par le jaataa he
 Here the police was eyeing his lover, but the police detective got a sensational news as soon as he caught this end of the investigation
 dilli ke is khatarnaak gang main shaamil ho gaya tha dilli kaa hi ek vardeevaala gunda or is pulisavaale ke taar jude the punjab police ke ek or vardeevaale ke saath
 Due to these tainted uniforms, Manoj Bakkarwala spread his network outside Delhi to many other states

 The government had recently raised the price of diesel by Rs five per liter and decided to reduce the supply of subsidized LPG cylinders to six cylinders per year for every family, which has sparked a backlash in the country
 tippaniyan Rangarajan said, "it will increase the price index immediately but later i think it will be the best thing in the medium term

 With regard to approving FDI in multi-brand retail business, Rangarajan said that this would provide an opportunity to improve the infrastructure facilities in the agricultural marketing sector which would ultimately result in a price drop
 unhone kaha ‘‘maujuuda vipanan vyavastha thos nahin he
 Therefore, foreign investment in organized retail business, especially retail, can improve the marketing system and thereby reduce prices slightly

 " rajd pramukh or purv kendriya mantri lalu prasad ne bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par aarope lagaaya ki unhone mahadalit ke naam par baba sahab bhimrao ambedkar ke vichaaron ko khandit karne kaa kaam kiya he
 Addressing the Ambedkar Jayanti cum Dalit Ekta Mahasammelan organized by RJD at Sri Krishna Memorial Hall in Patna, Lalu accused Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of denying Ambedkar's views in the name of Mahadalit
 lalu ne kaha ki ambedkar ne desh bhar ke daliton ko sangathit hone or ekajute hokar sangharsh karne kaa mul mantra diya tha par nitish ne mahadalit ke naam par unke vichaaron ko khandit karne kaa kaam kiya he
 The RJD chief alleged that on the one hand, Nitish celebrates the birth anniversary of Ambedkar, on the other hand practically his activities are against Dalits
 unhone kaha ki agar nitish ko dalit samudaay ke logon kaa utthan hi karnaa tha to paswan (dushaadh) samudaay ke logon ne aakhir kya qasoor kiya tha ki baaki sabhi jatiyon ko mahadalit main shaamil kar unhen shaamil nahin kiya
 Referring to Lord Buddha's 'buddhaam Sharanam Gachhami, Sangham Sharanam Gachhami' sermon, he asked the people of this community to become intelligent and clever and strengthen their unity
 lalu ne kaha ki bihar main vidhansabha kaa chunaav sannikat he or aise samay main vibhinn party dwaara unhen tarah-tarah kaa pralobhan diya jayega or todane kaa kaam kiya jayega par ve usulon ke pakke bane or unke pralobhan main na aaen
 Describing the Women's Reservation Bill as a conspiracy, Lalu said that after three elections, there will not be a single seat left for a single strong male candidate
 unhone kaha ki ve mahila aarakshan bill kaa virodh nahin karte balki uske vartmaan swaroop kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 The RJD chief said that women do not mind giving reservation to 50 or 70 percent, but they want representation of Muslim Dalit backward and extremely backward classes in it
 lalu ne kaha ki aarakshan samaaj ke vaise logon ko diya jaataa he jo ki apane str se sadan tak nahin pahunch sakate
 For such women, provision should be made in the Women's Reservation Bill, her party will support it
 rajd pramukh ne bihar sarkaar ko har morche par vifal bataate hue daawa kiya ki pradesh main hajaaron log bhukh se mar gaye par yahaan kii sarkaar centre dwaara bipiel pariwaron ke liye aavantit anaaj kaa 40 pratishat bhi uthaav nahin kar saki
 He said that referring to the incessant firefighting incidents in the state, Lalu stated the lack of firefighting firefighting numbers in the state
 lalu ne kaha ki garmi ke is mausam main jahaan logon ko pine kaa pani mayssar nahin he vahiin garibon ko pet kii aag bujhane ke liye anaaj nahin mil rahaa he
 Lalu said that laborers in the state are not getting work under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana
 agar kisi prakaar se mazdooree kar ve kuch paisa kamaate hai to pradesh sarkaar dwaara gaanv-gaanv main sharaab kii dukaan khol die jane se vah uski bhent chadh ja rahaa he or jisase gaanvon main gharelu kalah badhaa he
 He said that when the departmental minister raised the issue of scam in the allocation of liquor contract in Bihar, then the Chief Minister of the state Nitish Kumar refused to conduct a probe with the CBI
 lalu ne kaha ki pradesh sarkaar ke mahadalit samudaay ke logon ko awaas nirmaan ke liye teen dismil jameen uplabdh karaane ke aashwaasan ko ek chhalaava bataate hue kaha ki unki sarkaar ke kaarykaal main sabhi vaise bhoomihin graminon ko awaas ke liye bhoomi uplabdh karaane kaa nirnay liya gaya tha
 He said that to appease a few people, the present state government overturned the ceiling of their government's decision to provide land for employment to the poor in urban areas by abolishing the ceiling
 bihar kii nitish sarkaar par shiksha ko chaupat karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki aise shikshakon kii niyukt kar di jo ki bacchon ko is pratiyogita ke yug main gunvattta vaali shiksha nahin de sakate
 Addressing the conference, LJP chief and former Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said that the people of the Dalit community have to understand that the piece of bread that the state government is talking about in the name of Mahadalit is a hoax
 paswan ne kaha ki is samaaj ke logon ko yah samajhnaa hoga unka asli hitaishi koun he kyonki pradesh sarkaar mahadalit ke naam unki ekta ko todane ke prayaas main lagi he
 The announcement of the Nobel Prize 2017 has begun
 jaise-jaise vibhinn kshetron main puraskaar die ja rahe hai, vaise-vaise logon ke man main ye baat aana swaabhaavik he ki aakhir inam main kitne rupye milenge
 In fact, until last year, the winners of Nobel prizes used to get 8 million Swedish crowns
 par is saal ise badhaakar 9 million swedish crown (1
 12 million US dollars)
 ise bhartiya rupye main conwart karen to ye raashi 7 karod rupye se upar pahunchati he
 Even before the awards were announced, Nobel Foundation Chairman karl-heinrich Haldin issued a press release saying, "before the announcement of the 2017 Nobel Prizes, we want to inform all of you that this year we have awarded Prize Money one million Swedish
 Have decided to increase the crooner
 'gauratlab he ki samiti ne 2011 main prise mani ko 10 million se ghataakar 8 million swedish kranar kar diya tha
 This was done due to cost savings
 ab chunki foundation ke paas aavashyashk vittiya saadhan he to is prise mani ko ek baar phir badhaane kaa faisla liya gaya he

 On one side is North Korea's Marshal Kim, on the other, the President of the superpower
 donon ek duusare ko aamane saamne se dekhe bina hi is kadar nafrat karne lage hai ki lagata he ek duusare par hamalaa kiye bina chaiyn kii saans nahin lenge
 While Donald Trump has vowed to destroy Kim with the biggest warning, Kim has threatened to destroy the American island of Goam in response
 magar donon kii is tanatani kii gunj ab china main bhi sunai padane lagi he
 Trump also knows and the world knows that as long as China is there
 tab tak north korea par america hamalaa kar hi nahin saktaa
 Because of this there are many reasons, not his economic partnership or friendship with North Korea
 ye bhi sach he ki agar bina jang ke koi north korea maamle kaa nipataara karvaa saktaa he to wo china hi he
 This is the reason the US is emphasizing China's role in this matter
 khud trump ne china ko vyapaar badhaane kaa laalach bhi diya
 But China is still adopting a policy of watching the spectacle from a distance
 haalanki china khud bhi is samasya ko shanti se hal karnaa chahta he
 Because he knows that in the event of war, he will have to face two to four problems
 or sabase badi samasya north korian sharnaarthi honge
 Those who do not go to Japan and South Korea, will only turn to Chi 
 america agar north korea par hamalaa karata he to use lene ke dene pad sakate hai kyonki jang ke haalat main china ko har haal main north korea kaa saath dena hi hoga
 This is because both the US and North Korea have treaties with China
 1950 se lekar 1953 tak north or south korea ke bich chali jang main china or rus ne uttar korea kaa saath diya tha
 After which the war ended with a ceasefire treaty mediated by the UN
 is sandhi ke dauraan washington or beijing ke bich ek samjhauta ye bhi hua tha ki agar america bhavishya mennorth korea par hamalaakarta he to seez fire tut jayega
 Apart from this, in 1961 the leftist governments of China and North Korea entered into another important treaty
 jiskaa naam ‘china-uttar korian parsparik sahaayta or sahyog mitrataa sandhi’ tha
 The treaty states that if any country from China and North Korea attacks any other country, the two countries will have to cooperate with each other immediately
 pichley saalon main in donon deshon ne is sandhi kii vaidhata kii avadhi badhaakar 2021 tak kar di he
 Some foreign affairs experts say that both countries have benefited from this treaty
 jahaan china ne isse apane vyapaarik hit saadhe vahiin north korea ye sandhi karke apane aap ko or surakshit karne main kaamyaab ho gaya
 From the economic point of view, North Korea is very important for China
 pichley chaar dashakon se uttar korian bazaar main china kaa ek chhatraraj kaayam he
 Apart from this, the presence of US forces in this area has also disturbed China and that is why it wants to solve this problem soon
 china lagaataar yahi koshish kar rahaa he ki kisi tarah jang ke halaat ko khatm kiya ja sake
 That is why the Chinese Foreign Minister had warned both the US and North Korea that if there is a war, no one will win in it, while both may have to suffer the wounds that never go away
 magar ab china main is baat kii sugabugahat tej he ki jang ke halaat main china kaa role kya hoga
 
 sarkari akhbaar global times ke mutabik agar america north korea ke kilaaf satta parivartan ke iraade se hamalaa karata he to china ko chup nahin rahanaa chahie

 ladakh ke log apane liye janajaatiy kshetra kaa darja chaahate hai taaki desh ke duusare hisson se log aakar yahaan bas nahin paaen
 In this way, they will not be afraid of changing the demographic of Ladakh
 anuchhed-370 ke praavdhaanon kii vajah se ladakh main jammu-kashmir se baahar ke vyakti ko jameen kharidne kii ijaajat nahin thi
 According to the 2011 census, Adivasis constitute 80 per cent of the population of Leh and Kargil and 90 per cent of Ladakh
 ladakh ke log chaahate hai ki jansankhya kaa ye anupaat aage bhi barkaraar rahe
 Read: Ladakh has always wanted autonomy, fighting for independence and benefiting from the environment, but the environment is very fragile
 centre shasit pradesh banane se yahaan suvidhaayen badhengi to paryaton bhi badhegaa, yahaan ke logon kii kamai badhegi, lekin isse saath-saath chintaa ye bhi he ki bahari logon ke aane kaa asar paryaavaran par padegaa

 But when that matter failed politics, he was offered anew by making him a Hindu
 rahul gandhi brahman ban kar bhi safal nahin ho paa rahesushamaa ne aage kaha ki jab baat nahin ban paa rahi thi to congress ne kaha ki unke naanaa kii jati se unako jod diya jaae or unke naanaa nehru kii jati se jodakar unhen brahman bataa diya gaya
 It is heard that there is a change of religion but there is never a change of caste
 magar rahul gandhi brahman ban kar bhi safal nahin ho paa rahe the to phir nae sire se sochaa gaya or unhone kaha ki main janeudhari brahman hum

 collejon main edock main padhaa rahe teachers ke liye ye khushi kii khabar he
 University Grants Commission (UGC) Secretary Prof
 rajnish jain ne deshbhar ke sabhi kendriya, rajya va dimd vishvavidhyalayon ko patr likhakar suchit kiya he ki 4 june 2019 ko vishvavidhyalayon / collejon or dimd vishvavidhyalayon main sthaayee niyukti hetu disha nirdesh jari kiye gaye the
 It was said in the letter that all vacant posts should be filled within the given time limit so that quality higher education in higher educational institutions does not suffer
 isi sandarbh main unhone punah sabhi vishvavidhyalayon ko nirdesh dete hue suchit kiya he ki disha nirdeshon main di gai samay seemaa ke andar sabhi niyuktiyaan kii jaaen
 The process was closed after filling 150 posts, former member of Academic Council of Delhi University, Prof
 hansraj 'suman' ne bataaya he ki ujisi vishvavidhyalayon / collejon ko sthaayee niyukti sambandhi kai baar circular jari kar chukaa he
 Following the directions of the UGC, the Delhi University had issued advertisements to fill 4500 posts by its departments and colleges but the process was stopped after appointing about 150 posts
 ye he ujisi kaa patraisiilie ujisi ne punah nirdesh diya he ki sabhi vishvavidhyalay or college ye sunishchit karen ki sabhi rikt pad twarit rup se bharen
 In this context, the reservation policy of the government and all the details have been uploaded on the UGC website
 unka kahana he ki ujisi ne kaha he ki kripaya un nirdeshon kaa paalan karte hue aashwast kare ki khaali pad bhar diye jaayenge or niyukti prakriya jald armbh karen
 Thousands of adhoc teacherspro have been troubled for a long time
 suman ne kaha ki shikshakon ke khaali padon ko na bhare jane ke kaaran vishvavidhyalay / college kii ucch shiksha par dushprabhav pad rahaa he
 Also, there is a problem of not being permanent in front of adhoc teachers who are teaching in large numbers in universities and colleges
 yahi nahin vishvavidhyalayon / collejon main shikshakon va chaatro ke anupaat kaa dayera lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he
 The number of students has increased due to the implementation of reservation policies such as the recent EWS reservation at all levels by the government
 iske mukaable shikshakon kii sankhya pehle se bhi kamatar ho gai he aisi sthiti main jabaki nae chaatr-chatraayen apane kariyar ko banane ucch shiksha main pravesh lenaa chaahate ho or shikshakon kii aparyaapt sankhya jaise unke bheetar kuntha paidaa karti he or niraashaa banaati he, vahiin duusari ore saamaajik or aarthik str par yadi ye yuva bhagidaar nahin banenge to raashtra kaa nuksaan hi hoga
 The government should complete the appointments in this academic session as soon as possible and remove the obstacles to the path of quality higher education
 unhone bataaya he ki sarkaar kii nitiyon or ujisi ke nirdeshon se lagata he ki baar-baar aashaa kii kiran dikhalaai jaati he kintu uskaa koi sukhad parinaam dekhne ko nahin mil rahaa he
 In such a time of extreme despair, the resumption of teachers will create confidence in them, while the expansion of positive education will also be possible
 sirf diu main 5000 edock teacherpro
 Suman has stated that the number of adhoc teachers in the University of Delhi is constantly increasing
 is samay diu collejon main lagbhag 5 hajaar edock shikshak he iske alaava vibhaagon main 700 shikshak edock he
 In addition to the Law Faculty, Education Department and the Faculty of Management Studies last year, there was a ban on the appointment in a department of Daulatram College
 unka kahana he ki yadi is baar ujisi disha nirdeshon ko jo college paalan naa karen unka anudaan band kar dena chahie taaki vah niyukti prakriya na roak sake
 Advertisements removed in departments
 suman ne bataaya he ki dilli uniwarsity ne apane yahaan vibhaagon main sahaayak professor, associat professor va professor ke padon kaa vigyaapan nikaala he
 Colleges have passed the roster to remove the advertisements for the posts here, soon the colleges will remove advertisements to fill the vacancies in their colleges
 unhone bataaya he ki jis tarah se vigyaapan nikaale ja rahe hai, usase lagata he ki sitambar maah se sthaayee niyukti kii prakriya shuru ho jaaengi
 He thanked the UGC and said that colleges which do not remove advertisements for posts as soon as possible and do not inform them of the posts on the website, should stop their grant

 But when mps expressed anger at the parliamentary party meeting, Naidu explained, "this is not our culture"
 darasal, bijepi ke saansad rahul ke khilaaf nijee tippanee kar unhen baikfoot par dhakelne kii daleel de rahe the
 But instead of coming into the BJP leadership, the BJP wants to adopt such a strategy so that the Congress is seen in the main contest with it
 varanaa iskaa phayda kshetreey dal uthaa sakate hai
 The election of Delhi Legislative Assembly has become its leader
 jahaan bijepi ne apana vot share to bachaa liya, lekin congress virdohi vot puri tarah se aam aadmi party ke paksh main chalaa gaya or iskaa baari khamiyaja (70 main se teen hi siten jeet pai) bijepi ko uthaanaa padaa
 Confused by Rahul Avatar During the holiday session, Rahul Gandhi, who was said to be non-serious among the opponents due to his holiday, came back, and the angrier youngman who wore a sleeve was missing
 kisaan-majdoor-garib kii samasyaon ke saath modi sarkaar par rajnatik tippanee kaa andaaj bhi alag tha
 Perhaps it was not for the warlords of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, so they missed the opportunity to surround Rahul on holiday
 or rahul ne uskaa phayda uthaate hue bajet satr ke duusare hisse main dhardaar tareekon se mudde uthaane shuru kar die
 He raised the issue of farmers' plight ranging from delay in procurement of grains, net neutrality related to youth and closure of food parks in his parliamentary constituency Amethi
 sansad ke baahar bhi real estate bill se lekar kisaanon kii aatmahatya jaise mudde uthaae
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi also raised the issue of delay in appointment to Lokpal, Information Commission
 congress kii dabaav kii ranneeti kaam bhi ai or real estate bill ko rajyasabha main select cameti ko bhejnaa padaa to bhoomi adhigrahan bill ko sarkaar thande baste main daalati dikh rahi he
 How upset the government is with Rahul's attitude, it can be gauged that three to four ministers used to stand in the house to answer
 kisaanon ke mudde par krishi mantri radhamohan singh ne tathyaatmak jawaab diya jisaki khud modi ne baad main tarif kii, lekin ve rahul ko rajnatik rup se maat nahin de paae
 Communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also avoided personal comments on Net Neutrality
 to sadak or parivahan mantri nitin gadakari teen din baad sadan main likhit spashtikaran ke saath aane ko majaboor hue
 On the other hand, a section of the BJP is in favor that the party should also respond in the same language as Rahul is making personal comments on the Modi government
 congress yukt bharat kii ranneetilekin bijepi rajnatik napha-nuksaan ko dekhakar kadam uthaanaa chaahati he
 Prime Minister Modi had given the slogan of Congress Mukt Bharat before the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin saal bhar ke bheetar hi raajnneeti ne jis tarah karavat lee he, bijepi ke ranneetikaron ko lagane laga he ki congress kaa mukaable main rahanaa hi party ke liye hitkaari he
 BJP national spokesperson and election analyst GVL Narasimha Rao says, "when we raise our voice against the Congress, we challenge its politics and ideology
" aisa nahin ki ham congress ko khatm karnaa chaahate hai
 Actually, we talk about the damage done to the country due to the Congress
 " loksabhaa chunaav ke aankadon kaa vishleshan yah bataata he ki jin kshetron main bijepi kaa congress se sidhaa muqabla hua, vahaan party kii jeet kii dar 88 fisadi rahi or jahaan kshetreey dalon se muqabla hua vahaan 49 fisadi
 In a political sense, the Congress-rich India is suitable for the BJP
 haal hi main janata parivaar kii ekajutata ne party kii mushkilen badha di hai
 The BJP feels that the Janata Parivar will present a big challenge for it in Bihar
 isliye party argedy se nikaale gaye saansad pappu yadav or purv siem jithan ram maanjhi jaise logon par nigaah gadaaye hue he
 The BJP believes that there will be a huge upheaval in the Janata Parivar before the elections
 isliye party rahul ko tarjeeh dekar yah sandesh dena chaahati he ki uske mukaable main sirf congress hi he
 Says a BJP official, "negative remarks like Modi's death merchant made him a hero, we also will not encourage Rahul by making such personal remarks
 lekin rahul ko nitigat masalon par tathyon ke saath jawaab diya jayega
 "but the way Rahul is attacking the Modi government, it has created a tremendous panic in the BJP
 dilli main khatarnaak str par pradooshanvaayu gunvattta suchakank ke 415 ke pardilli sarkaar ne jari kiya circulardesh kii rajdhani dilli main pradooshan khatarnaak str par pahunch gaya he
 According to data from the Central Pollution Control Board, the air quality index has reached 419 which is dangerous level
 vaayu pradooshan kaa str itnaa zyada bad gaya he ki aasmaan main dhuen kii parat saaf dekhi ja sakati he
 In view of this, the Delhi government has issued a circular to protect school children from this dangerous pollution
 bacchon ke abhibhavakon ko nirdeshdilli sarkaar ke shiksha nideshaalay ke circular ke anusaar, dilli ke sabhi nijee or sarkari skulon ko nirdesh die gaye hai ki bacchon ke abhibhavakon ko maujuuda vaayu pradooshan ke prati jaagruk kiya jaae
 Parents should be advised not to send children for outdoor activity as long as the air pollution is at a dangerous level, as the current level of pollution can cause harm to children's health
 ye nirdesh bacchon ke abhibhavak ke saath-saath skulon ke pramukhon ko bhi die gaye hai ki jab tak pradooshan kaa str khatarnaak bana hua he tab tak skool main koi outdoor activity yojit na kii jaae
 Advice not to go out of the house: Due to pollution, 30 percent people are reaching the hospital every day complaining of shortness of breath, chest pain and cough

 shila dikshit ko jab se congress ne upi main mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya he, piem narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii sari chunavi ranneeti par pani phir gaya he
 The Samajwadi Party faces Mulayam Singh Yadav and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav in the UP elections, while the Bahujan Samaj Party will contest only in the name of Mayawati, the Congress has also put the BJP in trouble by making Sheela Dixit the CM candidate to show her participation in this fight
 bijepi piem modi chehre ke saath upi ke is mahasamar main janaa chaahati thi lekin ab maamla badal rahaa he
 BJP has only one big face! Actually the problem of BJP is that in UP, though the party has many faces who can be made the chief ministerial candidates, but in front of Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayawati, they seem very dwarf
 
 congress ne bhi ek bade chehre shila dikshit ko maidan main utaara he jo 15 saal dilli kii mukhyamantri rahi hai or upi kii kannauj se loksabhaa saansad rahete huecendre sarkarmen mantri bhi rahi hai
 The BJP has only one face that can contest big faces like Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mayawati and Sheela Dixit and that is Rajnath Singh
 lekin rajnath singh upi chunaav main party kaa cheharaa banane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Mukhabarajnath Singh made it hard on Sheila's arrival, it was clear to PM Modi and Amit Shah before the executive meeting in Allahabad that he does not want to go back to UP politics as the face of the party in elections but with the arrival of Sheila Dixit The competition has become even tougher, so PM Modi and Amit Shah want Rajnath Singh to be made the chairman of the Campaign Committee of UP
 in donon bade netaaon ko lagata he ki upi chunaav main rajnath singh ko cheharaa na bana kar sabase bade netaa ke taur project karne se party ko phayda milegaa
 Annoyed with BJP, Janatrajnath Singh of UP has been an old expert in UP politics
 rajnath singh jaanate hai ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jo maahaul bijepi ke liye bana tha wo ab nahin he
 Those close to Rajnath Singh say that there is a lot of resentment in the public against the BJP mps and the caste structure on which the party is built will not be able to stand in front of other parties
 kai bade varisht netaa bhi party ke kai faislon se naaraaz hai aise main chunaav jeetna mushkil hi nahin asambhav hoga
 Party president Amit Shah has once again started raping Rajnath Singh in front of the leaders of the Sangh for a strong claim in Shahup, who has come to the Sangh
 sangh ke sah mahasachiv dattatreya hosaable ke paas upi kii kaman he
 Dattatreya Hosabale and Suresh Soni will talk to Rajnath Singh on behalf of the Sangh
 sangh rajnath singh ko is baat ke liye raji kar rahaa he ki bijepi chunaav haare yaa jite wo centre sarkaar main grahamantri bane rahenge
 Following the behest of Rajnath Singh, the party will decide on UP and will also try to appear at the forefront of the battle for UP assembly elections

 com / uguxxgswgl — India Today (@indiatoday) September 24, 2019 Let's come to September 2019: India Today Open Source Investigation found that Pakistan is running a hidden uranium enrichment program in a nuclear project located in Kahuta, Rawalpindi district
 OSINT ke nishkarshon se pataa chalaa ki kilaband is lokation ko gopneeyata ke parde se dhakne kii puri koshish kii gai he
 The International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA) has labeled the lab as an 'illegal source of nuclear technology'
 saath hi ise ‘newclear aprasar ke liye gambhir khatra’ bhi bataaya
 The high resolution satellite images obtained by India Today's OSINT team confirm the new facility built is just 800 meters from the old lab of Mine Research Laboratory in Kahuta
 in tasveeron ko baariki se dekhne par notice kiya ja saktaa he ki kaise 2014 main jo khaali helleyped tha, us zamin ke tukade ko 2019 main sambhavit newclear centriphyus facility main badal diya gaya he
 The black past is behind these deadly new photos
 swatantra global think tanks ke shodh pehle ishaara de chuke hai ki isi lokation par koi nirmaanadhin dhaancha sthit he
 'the Nuclear Threat Initiative' (NTI), Jens and The Institute for Science and International Security agreed that the structure that was being created at the time was similar to nuclear centrifuges
 newclear centrifus us facility ko kehete hai jahaan uranium ko sanvardhit kar newclear bam banane laayak taqatvar eendhan banaaya jaataa he
 Construction on the Kahuta Center was ongoing, so the foreign watchdogs did not come to any conclusion
 india today kii ore se hasil kii gai nai satellite tasveeron se pushti hui ki dhaancha 6 hectare main failaa he or ab puri tarah taiyaar he
 It has a boundary wall around two meters thick
 saath hi chat ko is tarah banaaya gaya he jisase yahaan kii asaliyat saamne naa aa sake
 That is, all efforts have been made to keep this facility hidden from the world
 ritred air vaais marshall sunil nanodakar ko jab in taaja tasveeron ko dikhaaya gaya to unhone kaha, ‘maine jo satellite tasviren dekhin, usase unki pehle se chali aa rahi manshaa samaj aa gai
 i think it is very surprising that the international community did not give much voice to this
 ye facility kahuta main us puraani facility ke bahut paas viksit kii ja rahi he, jahaan lab main pakistan kii newclear kshamtaaon kaa hathiyaarikaran ho rahaa he
 i think we need to see clearly what its potential will be
 ham jaanate hai ye newclear facility he
 Ravi Kumar Gupta, former director of the Public Interface Division of DRDO, has a similar view
 wo kehete hai, ‘ye dikhaata he ki pakistan apni newclear enrichament facility kaa vistaar karne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 We cannot ignore it because it is very close to the mine research laboratory
 vahi jagah jahaan pakistan newclear bam or missile viksit karata he
 In such a situation, the world community should take it very seriously
 ’pakistan kaa civil newclear program bhi he jo china kii madad se chal rahaa he
 But the mine research facility is not under the iaea's Global Safeguards
 jab pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan bhavishya ke kisi newclear flashpoint kii jimmedaari vaishvik samudaay par rakh rahe hai, aise main visheshgy maanate hai ki ye samay he antarrashtriya samudaay ke dakhal dene kaa he
 Retired Air Vice Marshal Nanodkar says, "these pictures take you closer to the facilities in Iran and North Korea
" agar aaj ham kahen ki ye sirf iran or north korea hai or pakistan nahin he, to zarur kuch gadbady vaala he
 i think we should raise it

 Former Delhi government ministers Arvinder Singh Lovely and Harun Yusuf said that the Delhi government, led by the Aam Aadmi Party, which used to talk about corruption, is trying to divert the attention of people from corruption by taking CCTV cameras
 ajay maakan ne aarope lagaaya he ki aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne dilli main sisitivi camera lagane ke project main bhrashtachar kiya he or desh kii suraksha ko daav par lagaakar bharat sarkaar kii company bel ke dwaara china kii sarkari company hik vijan ko theka de diya
 The Congress said that the initial cost of the project of installing CCTV cameras in Delhi was 130 crores, which was 571 by giving relaxation in the tender conditions
 40 karod kar diya gaya or jab bel kii vender list main hik vijan ko daal diya gaya tab yah tender bel ko diya gaya
 Harun Yusuf said that Delhi has a government of Alibaba and 66 thieves
 lavali ne kaha ki sisodiya yah jataa rahe the ki aap party kii dilli sarkaar dilli main sisitivi camere lagane ke liye kal hi taiyaar thi or yah kaary aradblue ko saupana chaah rahi thi, parantu is kaary main vipakshi dal va dilli ke uparajyapal roda atka rahe hai jo ki jhooth he
 Lovely said that from the committee created by the Lieutenant Governor on the issue of CCTV cameras, it seems that he is trying to change the issue of CCTV camera corruption
 aravindar singh lavali ne kaha ki congress party ko manish sisodiya se is baat kaa pramaan patr nahin chahie ki congress kii dilli sarkaar ne 15 saal main apane kaarykaal main kitne kaam kiye the
 He said that Delhi knows the development work done by Congress very well
 unhone kaha ki aap party kii dilli sarkaar ne pichley 3 saalon main un kaaryon ko bhi aage nahin le ja pai jinaki shuruyaat congress kii dilli sarkaar ne kii thi
 The AAP government is also unable to maintain the development work done by the Congress government

 jabakejariwal sarkaarne 21 parliament secretary kii niyukti kii us vakt bhi in niyuktiyon par sawaal khadey kiye gaye the
 a petition was also filed in the Delhi High Court that this appointment of 21 Parliament Secretary is unconstitutional
 ek lambii sunwaayee ke baad hoicourt ne is yachika par apana faisla sunaate hue saaf kar diya tha ki ye sabhi niyuktiyaan avaidh hai

 Chakravyuh is becoming stronger against BCCI President Srinivasan

 There is uproar
 har taraf shor he
 The same questions are being fired from every side
 har koi ek hi sawaal puch rahaa he
 When is the Bigg Boss of cricket i
e
 its BCCI President n Srinivasan going? When will he leave hatenge yaa hataae jaaenge
 Will he resign himself or be resigned? Or is it not that they will not move at all? The son-in-law is inside the betting
 ipel satte ke chakkar main badnaam, or khilaadi usee satte ke chakkar main maidan kii bajaae jail main hai

 Isn't it wonderful? ab bisisiai ke member shrinivasana kii kismat kaa kya faisla karte hai yaa shrinivasana khud ke liye kya faisla lete hai ye to pataa nahin
 But yes satta bazaar ke taaja bhav ke hisaab se shrinivasana kii vidaai tay he, or is vidaai kaa bhav khulaa he 40 paise se
 Now if you think that Srinivasan is not going, then you can claim 42 paise
 yani agar aap is bhav ke hisaab se ek lakh lagaate hai to unki vidaai par aapako 40 hajaar milenge
 Whereas if you lose, you will gain one lakh by just applying 42 thousand
 yani satta bazaar yahi chahega ki shrinivasana kii vidaai ho hi ho

 ) In the wintry weather, the politics of Delhi has become hot once again
 chunaav ayog ne jaise hi aam aadmi party ke 20 vidhayakon ko ayogy tehraate hue raashtrapati ke paas sifarish bheji, dilli kii siyasat main khalabali much gai he
 If the President accepts the recommendation, then there can be a lot of trouble in front of the Kejriwal government
 kaise raajnneetik mushkil main funs sakate hai kejariwal?2015 ke dilli vidhansabha chunaav main aam aadmi party ne rajya kii 70 siton main 67 siton par jeet darj kii thi
 After this, Jarnail Singh, who was MLA from Rajouri Garden seat, resigned to contest the assembly elections from Punjab
 phir upachunaav main ye seat bijepi ke khate main chali gai
 In this way, 66 mlas of Kejriwal's party were left
 ab chunaav ayog ne 20 vidhayakon ko ayogy tehraaya diya he
 In such a situation, after leaving his membership, the party will have only 8 more than majority in the assembly
 bataa den ki 2015 main party prachand bahumat se saath satta main ai thi
 It is becoming less common that AAP MLA Kejriwal does not have the same problem, he himself has removed 4 ministers
 matia mahal se vidhayak mo
 Asim and Kapil Mishra, Jitendra Singh Tomar trapped in the degree case and Sandeep Kumar after the sex cds are also involved
 agar 20 or nikaal die gaye to sankhya or kam ho jaaegi
 If the 20 mlas who are disqualified by the Election Commission remove them and rebel legislators from the party, then Kejriwal has only 44 mlas left
 bahumat ke 36 vidhayakon kii jarurat hoti he, jisaki sankhya kejariwal ke paas hai
 But only 8 mlas will be left more than majority
 baagiyon se bhi ghire hai kejarivalaap main kuch aise netaa hai jo lagaataar baagi tevar apanaae hue hai
 Recently, the founding member of the party and senior leader Kumar Vishwas is also angry at the party not sending it to the Rajya Sabha
 is tarah kejariwal ko apni sarkaar ko bachaae rakhane or vidhayakon par pakad banaae rakhana tedi kheer hoga
 Explain that many mlas in the party are close to Kumar Vishwas
 aise main kejariwal jis andaaj se abhi tak dilli sarkaar chalaa rahe the, us tarah ab satta chalaanaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Not only this, it will not be easy for them to take strong decisions and ignore the legislators
 hataae gaye aap ke 20 vidhayak to kya hoga?aap ke 20 vidhayakon kii sadsyta jane ke baad upachunaav honge
 It is difficult to say whether Kejriwal and his party won these seats again
 bataa den ki jis tarah kii lahar 2015 ke chunaav ke samay kejariwal kii thi, uskaa graph gira he
 In the last by-election in two seats, where one seat has gone to bjp's account, one seat was won by AAP
 is tarah in 20 siton par dobaaraa jeet kaa paracham fahraana aasaan nahin he
 Aam Aadmi Party leader Anjali Damania has resigned from the party
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki anjali party ke kaamkaaj ke tareeke se khush nahin thim
 She has written that Arvind Kejriwal is like her elder brother and she respects Arvind
 anjali damania ne nagpur se nitin gadakari ke khilaaf chunaav ladaa tha
 Gadkari defeated him by nearly three lakh votes
 anjali damania ne apane istife main aap party ke sahyogiyon ko likhaa he ki mere is achaanak nirnay ke liye koi jimmedaar nahin he
 Dear friends, i am breaking up with you with a heart
 main arvind kejariwal kaa bahut sammaan karti hum
 He is like my elder brother
 or sabhi se prarthana he ki mere istife ko lekar kisi tarah kii raajnneeti shadyantra kii dharanaen na banaaen
 i have never compromised on my values and never will
 main media se bhi prarthana karti hum ki meri niztaa kii khyaal rakhen
 Along with this, he wished the party all the best
 ullekhneey he ki anjali damania tab surkhiyon main ai thim jab unhone tatkaaleen bijepi adhyaksh nitin gadakari par sinchai ghotaale ko dabaane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 They said that they did so due to their proximity to Sharad Pawar
 gauratlab he ki 2014 ke chunaav main aam aadmi party ne maharashtra main 48 loksabhaa siton par apane ummidavaar khadey kiye the, lekin party ek bhi seat nahin jeet pai
 Several senior party leaders, including Anjali, Mayank, Medha Patkar and Vijay Pandhare, lost the election
 unki hatya ke baad bengaluru se lekar dilli tak pradarshan hua tha or rajya sarkaar ne maamle kii jaanch ke liye esaiti kaa gathan kiya tha
 However, the officials involved in the investigation have refused to comment on the Home Minister's claim
 aapako bataa den ki karnataka main is samay congress kii sarkaar he or is maamle main jaanch main koi teji na aane se gauri lankesh ke parijanon ne sarkaar kii bhi aalochana kii thi
 At the same time, an official also says that the logic of the murder of Gauri Lankesh can also be related to the rationalist MM Kulbargi murder
 2015 main hue is hatyakand ke aaropee bhi abhi tak pakade nahin ja sake hai

 Shaheed Bhagat Singh had the courage and sensitivity to say 'meri Mehbooba to Azadi hai', at the age of boyhood
 aaj unka janmdin he
 Saluting them, we are presenting their views on the problem of communalism
 june, 1928 ke ‘kirti’ main chapa yah lekh sampradayikta par bhagat singh or unke saathiyon ke vichaaron kaa saar he
 These ideas have become even more relevant among the latest wounds of Muzaffarnagar
 aap bhi padhein orsochen ki kya sampradayikta kaa isse zyada taarkik or majboot uttar or kuch ho saktaa he?'bharat varsh kii dasha is samay badi dayaneey he
 Followers of one religion are known enemies of followers of another religion
 ab to ek dharm kaa hona hi duusare dharm kaa kattar shatru hona he
 If you are not sure about this then just look at the latest riots in Lahore
 kis prakaar musalamaanon ne nirdosh sikhon, hinduon ko maaraa he or kis prakaar sikhon ne bhi vash chalate koi kasar nahin chodi he
 This killing was not done because a person is guilty, but because a person is a Hindu or a Sikh or a Muslim
 bas kisi vyakti kaa sikh yaa hindu hona musalamaanon dwaara maare jane ke liye kaaphi tha or isi tarah kisi vyakti kaa musalmaan hona hi uski jaan lene ke liye paryaapt tark tha
 When the situation is like this, God is the master of India
 dharmon ne kar diya he desh kaa bedaa garkaisi sthiti main hindustan kaa bhavishya bahut andhkaarmay najar aata he
 These 'religions' have lost the fleet of India
 or abhi pataa nahin ki yah dharmik dange bharatvarsh kaa peechha kab chodenge
 These riots have defamed India in the eyes of the world
 or hamane dekha he ki is andhvishwaas ke bahaav main sabhi bah jate hai
 It is rarely a Hindu, a Muslim or a Sikh who keeps his mind cool, all the other religions hold the sticks, swords and knuckles in their hands to maintain the glory of their Namleva religion
 They die by sabotage
 baaki kuch to phaansi chadh jate hai or kuch jelon main phenk diye jate hai
 Due to so much bloodshed, the English government's punishment is inflicted on these 'religious people' and then the worm of their brain comes to their rescue
 sabakaa bhala chaahane vaale netaa kamayaha tak dekha gaya he, in dangon ke peeche sampradayik netaaon or akhabaaron kaa haath he
 At this time, the leaders of India have taken such a step that it is well done
 vahi netaa jinhone bharat ko swatantra karaane kaa bidaa apane siron par uthaaya hua tha or jo ‘samaan rashtriyata’ or ‘swarajya-swarajya’ ke damgaje maarthe nahin thakte the, vahi yaa to apane sir chipaaye chupchaap baithe hai yaa isi dharmandhata ke bahaav main bah chale hai
 Is the number of people sitting in the head hidden even less? But such leaders who have joined the communal movement, hundreds come out by digging the land
 jo netaa hriday se sabakaa bhala chaahate hai, aise bahut hi kam hai
 And there has been such a severe flood of communalism that they too cannot stop it
 aisa lag rahaa he ki bharat main netritv kaa diwaala pit gaya he
 The role of local newspapers is also questioned
 The other gentlemen who have been taking special part in instigating communal riots are newspaper people
 patrakarita kaa vyavsaay, kisi samay bahut ooncha samajha jaataa tha
 Today it has become very messy
 yah log ek-duusare ke viruddh bade mote-mote sheershak dekar logon kii bhavanaayen bhadakaate hai or paraspar sir phutowwal karavaate hai
 Not only in one or two places, in many places there are riots because the local newspapers have written very exciting articles
 aise lekhak bahut kam he jinka dil va dimag aise dinon main bhi shant rahaa ho
 The real duty of the newspapers was to impart education, remove parochialism from the people, remove communal sentiments, promote mutual reconciliation and create a common nationality of India
 Has destroyed the common nationality of India
 yahi kaaran he ki bharatvarsh kii vartmaan dasha par vichaar kar ankhon se rakt ke ansu bahane lagate hai or dil main sawaal uthta he ki ‘bharat kaa banegaa kya?’swarajya sapana maatr ban gaya hajo log asahyog ke dinon ke josh va ubhaar ko jaanate hai, unhen yah sthiti dekh ronaa aata he
 Where were the glimpses of the freedom of those days, and where today is the day that self-government has become a dream
 bas yahi teesraa laabh he, jo in dangon se atyaachaariyon ko mila he
 Whose existence was threatened, that went today, gone tomorrow, the same bureaucracy has today strengthened its roots so much that it is no small task to move it
 arthshaastra main hai dangon kii jadenyadi in sampradayik dangon kii jad khojein to hamen iskaa kaaran aarthik hi jaan padataa he
 During the days of non-cooperation, leaders and correspondents made many sacrifices
 unki aarthik dasha bighad gayi thi
 At the slowing down of the non-cooperation Movement, there was a mistrust of the leaders, which ruined the trades of many communal leaders today
 vishwa main jo bhi kaam hota he, uski tah main pet kaa sawaal jarur hota he
 This is one of the three major theories of Karl Marx
 isi siddhanth ke kaaran hi tabalig, tankeem, shuddhi aadi sanghathan shuru hue or isi kaaran se aaj hamaari aisi durdasha hui, jo avarnaneey he
 Someone can get someone humiliated by giving them a rumor
 Just the treatment of all riots, if any, can be done only by improving the economic condition of India
 darasal bharat ke aam logon kii aarthik dasha itani kharaab he ki ek vyakti duusare ko chavanni dekar kisi or ko apamaanit karvaa saktaa he
 Angry with hunger and misery, man puts all principles on hold
 sach he, marataa kya na karata
 But it is very difficult to get economic reform in the present situation because the government is foreign and does not allow the situation of the people to improve
 isiilie logon ko haath dhokar iske peeche pad janaa chaiye or jab tak sarkaar badal na jaye, chaiyn kii saans na lenaa chahie
 There is a need for class consciousness to prevent the people of the poor, working people and peasants from fighting together
 garib, mehanatakashon va kisaanon ko spasht samajha dena chahie ki tumhaare asli dushman puunjipati hai
 Therefore, you should stay away from their gimmicks and do nothing to climb their arms
 sansar ke sabhi garibon ke, chaahe ve kisi bhi jati, rang, dharm yaa raashtra ke hon, adhikaar ek hi hai
 It is in your goodness that you unite by eliminating the discrimination of religion, color, race and nationality and country and try to take the power of government in your hands
 in yatnon se tumhaara nuksaan kuch nahin hoga, isse kisi din tumhaari zanjeeren cat jaayengi or tumhen aarthik swatantrata milegi
 There has been a class consciousness in Russia
 People who know the history of Russia, they know that there were similar situations there at the time of the Tsar, there were also many communities who used to keep mutually mutilating
 lekin jis din se vahaan shramik-shashan hua he, vahaan nakshaa hi badal gaya he
 Now there have never been riots
 ab vahaan sabhi ko ‘insaan’ samajha jaataa he, ‘dharmajan’ nahin
 The economic condition of the people was very poor at the time of the Tsar
 isliye sab dange-fasaad hote the
 But now the economic condition of the Russians has improved and class consciousness has come in them, so no rioting ever came from there
 in dangon main vaise to bade niraashajanak samachar sunne main aate hai, lekin kalkatte ke dangon main ek baat bahut khushi kii sunne main aayi
 That is, the workers of the trade union did not take part in the riots there, nor did they get involved in inter-segregation, but all the Hindus and Muslims kept on rising in factories etc
 with great love and also trying to stop the riots
 yah isliye ki unamem varg-chetana thi or ve apane vargahit ko acchhee tarah pahachaanate the
 This is the beautiful way of class consciousness, which can stop communal riots
 yuvaaon ke vichaaron main he khulaapanayah khushi kaa samachar hamaare kaanon ko mila he ki bharat ke navayuvak ab vaise dharmon se jo paraspar ladaana va ghrinaa karnaa sikhaate hai, tang aakar haath dho rahe hai
 There is so much openness in them that they treat the people of India as a religion - not Hindu, Muslim or Sikh, but first consider them human, then Indians
 bharat ke yuvakon main in vichaaron ke paidaa hone se pataa chalata he ki bharat kaa bhavishya sunahalaa he
 Indians should not panic seeing these riots etc
 unhen ytn karnaa chahie ki aisa vaataavaran hi na bane, or dange hon hi nahin
 Do not mix religion and politics The martyrs of 1914-15 had separated religion from politics
 ve samajhate the ki dharm vyakti kaa vyaktigat maamla he isamen duusare kaa koi dakhal nahin
 Nor should it enter politics because it does not allow Sarabat to work together in one place
 isliye gadar party jaise aandolan ekajute va ekajan rahe, jisamen sikh bad-chadhakar phansiyon par chadhe or hindu musalmaan bhi peeche nahin rahe
 At this time some Indian leaders have also come into the field who want to separate religion from politics
 jhagada mitaane kaa yah bhi ek sundar ilaaj he or ham iskaa samarthan karte hai
 If religion is separated then we can all gather on politics
 dharmon main ham chaahe alag-alag hi rahen
 We believe that the true sympathizers of India will definitely consider the treatment given to us and will save us from the suicides that are happening in India at this time

 Sincerely Anand's blog) big bos se baahar aane ke baad sapana choudhary mangalvaar ko pehali baar fasebuk par live najar ain
 In the Facebook Live video, Sapna asked fans many questions about her Bollywood item number to Bigg Boss contestant
 big bos se baahar aane ke baad phans dwaara puche gaye sawaalon kaa sapana ne kaise diya jawaab aaie jaane:sapana choudhary ne kii thi jehar khaakar jaan dene kii koshish, ye thi vajah'lav bits' se bollywood main entrighar se baahar aate hi wo apane kaam main jute gai hai
 She is soon to make her Bollywood debut
 unki debyue film he bhangover
 It has an item song of Sapna
 is item kaa naam 'lav bits' he
 Sapna told that this is a very funny song and people will enjoy listening to it
 sapana ne lav bits ke bare main bataaya ki pehali baar jab unhone ye gaanaa suna to shocked thim
 He could not believe that such a lovely song could be made in Haryanvi
 fasebuk live ke dauraan sapana ne bataaya ki wo aane vaale dinon main film ke pramotion event main bhi shaamil hongi
 Know through the pictures, Sapna Chaudhary said on the question of singer Sapna Chaudhary's life
 
 
 fasebuk live ke dauraan zyaadaatar logon ne sapana choudhary kaa haal poocha? sabhi ko shukriya bolte hue sapana ne jawaab diya ki wo bahut acchhee hai
 He said, i am very good because of your prayers
 iske baad ek yujar ne sapana choudhary se big bos 11 kii contestant hina khan ke bare main jaananaa chaha
 He asked- What girl is Hina? Sapna could not escape answering this question
 unhone kaha, 'main unke bare main kuch nahin bataa sakati
 You ask me here about the item song 'love Bite' of my first Bollywood film
 is gane ko lekar jitne sawaal puuchhenge main jawaab duungi
 Sapna refused to comment on Hina Khan
 ek baat to tay he ki is live video ke dauraan sapana se phans ne big bos ko lekar zyada sawaal puche lekin sapana ne kisi bhi sawaal kaa jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya
 These 5 reasons led to Sapna Chaudhary coming out of Bigg Boss x Contestant show like Bijg Bose out of BIGG BOSS and showing her co-contestant fiercely, while Sapna Chaudhary is seen outside the house in safe game attitude too
 shaayad sapana industry main apni shuruyaat kisi vivaad ke saath nahin karnaa chaahatin, lekin vivaad or sapana donon kaa rishta bahut purana rahaa he aise main dekhnaa hoga sapana kab tak vivaadon se dur rahati he

 ab tahiraa ne bataaya he ki kaise ayushmaan ne unhen ek ajab niknem diya he
 Tahira shared two photos saying that Ayushmann named him "harish"
 pehle unhen laga ki ye ajeeb he, lekin kute he
 Sometimes people give strange nicknames to their partners
 lekin jab unhen iske peeche kaa kaaran samaj aayaa to wo shock rah gayi
 Tahira understood that Ayushmann was calling him 1990 actor Harish Kumar because of his hairstyle
 tahiraa ne likhaa, "ye main hum bilkul subah-subah, jab maine koi hair product nahin lagaaya tha or ayushmaan ne mujhe harish naam se bulaayaa
 i could not understand this for a long time and strangely i also called this name cute
 aisa hota he naa jab aap kisi se pyaar karte hai to unhen alag-alag naamon se pukaarte hai
 "tahira said, i thought something similar was happening to me until i came to know about it

 # lookalike # antigravityhairview this post on instagramthat's me right in the morning without any hair product and @ayushmannk calls me Harish! For the longest time i couldn't recollect and found it cute in a weird way

 ol india majalis-e-ittehad-ul musalamin ke adhyaksh or saansad asaduddin ovaisi kaa kahana he ki vah mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko topi pehanaane kii jagah kehete ki aap un logon se miliye or unki samasyaayein suniye jinke saath jurm ho rahaa he, kyonki yah unki duty he
 Talking to Shweta Singh in Aaj Tak's special program 'sidhi Baat', recently, on the question of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's refusal to wear a hat, Asaduddin Owaisi said, "I would not have given him a hat if i was there, you are the CM, you are giving Kasim Called and embraced, Qasim was beaten to death by begging for water
 uttar pradesh main bacchee ke saath molestesan hua, use paas bulaakar bolte ki main tumhaara baap hum, tumhaara bhai hum, ye kahana chahie tha
 'he said who would wear the hat
 topi to ye pahana hi rahe hai itane saalon se
 This is your duty and you are not doing any favor, you are the Chief Minister
 wo to kar hi nahin paa rahe
 Following the decision to hoist the tricolor and the national anthem in a recently-held madrasa in Uttar Pradesh, wearing a kurta-pajama is now being objected to
 is parovaisine kaha ki pehle mukhyamantri safed kurta-pajama pahan kar dikhaaen
 Saying this, you become an example
 topi na sahi, aap kurta-pajama pahan lijie
 From where Modi ji makes clothes, sew them and wear kurta-pajamas
 lekin aap to aisa nahin kar sakate or dusron ko badalane ke liye kah rahe hai
 On the question of whether the madrasa is considered an educational or religious institution, Owaisi said that the Sachar Committee report came in which said that only four per cent of Muslim children are studying in the madrasa
 wo vahaan isliye pard rahe hai kyonki vahaan par koi skool nahin he
 Had there been a school, they would have gone to study there
 saath hi islam kaa buniyadi makasad yah he ki usko samajhnaa or logon ke bich pahunchaana
 For this, we will need imams, kajis and scholars, doing all this work from the madrasa itself
 aazaadee kii jang main madrason ne ahm yogadan diya
 Owaisi spoke of maintaining an atmosphere against Muslims, saying that if you do not want to open schools, you do not want children to go to madrasas, you do not want to open schools, thousands of posts in colleges are empty in schools, they are not being filled
 bas unka yahi makasad he ki musalamaanon ko lekar jehar ghola jaae or janata ke bich nafrat paidaa kii jaae
 Also, such an atmosphere should be created that these people do not like promotion and do not want to change the dates of 1400 years old
 madasaron main sudhaar par sawaal khadaa kiye jane ko lekar ovaisi ne kaha ki aap skool kholie, achche kaam kariye aap ko koun roktaa he
 We want our children to be educated

 Why did Devendra Fadnavis trust Ajit Pawar and get his scorn made, this question still remains
 haalanki devendra fadanvis ye saaf kar chuke hai ki ajit pavaar apane saath 54 vidhayakon ke hastakshar vaali suchi laaye the or daawa kiya tha ki zyaadaatar vidhayak shivasena kii bajaay bijepi ke saath sarkaar banane ke paksh main hai
 If this was the case, why did not a single NCP MLA stay with Ajit Pawar till the last moment? According to NCP sources, as soon as the bjp's seats were reduced in the Maharashtra Assembly election results on October 24, the resentment of taking advantage of it in the NCP and Shiv Sena camp started
 ensipi mukhiya sharad pavaar kii dur drushti ne rajya main ek nae raajnneetik sameekaran kii tasviir dekh lee thi
 But a large faction in his party including Ajit Pawar was not in favor of going with Shivesana
 wo chahta tha ki bijepi ke saath milakar centre or rajya donon jagah satta main sahabhaagi ho
 Whereas the other faction said that Sharad Pawar had increased his stature by facing the ED notice and the way he got public support against BJP in the state, going with BJP would spoil Sharad Pawar's image and The wrong message will go, while forming a government with the Shiv Sena and the Congress will also increase the stature of the party and Sharad Pawar and control the state government
 lekin ajit pavaar ke saath party ke zyaadaatar vidhayak or netaa bijepi ke saath jane ke paksh main the
 According to an NCP leader, a meeting of around 20 selected leaders was called for this and since Sharad Pawar himself was in favor of making Aghadi together with Shiv Sena and Congress, most of them were told their wishes
 aakhir vahi hua jo sharad pavaar chaahate the
 Mostly expressed their opinion in favor of Shiv Sena
 sharad pavaar apni party kaa man banane main to kaamyaab ho gaye lekin abhi congress ko manaanaa baaki tha
 The leaders of the state Congress were almost ready
 dilli se vishesh taur par mumbai aaye ahamed patel, ke si venugopal or mallikarjun khadge ke saath shivasena ke party pramukh uddhav thakare kii mulaakaat bhi ho chuki thi
 But the green signal from the Congress was not available
 jaruri tha ki congress sarkaar ke andar aaye par baat ban nahin rahi thi
 Sharad Pawar and Sonia Gandhi's meeting in Delhi was also not successful
 lekin congress ke vidhayakon kaa dabaav unki apni party par bad rahaa tha
 Sharad Pawar went to Delhi and met Sonia Gandhi once again
 dilli main hi ensipi or congress netaaon kii baithak hui
 At the same time, there was a conversation with Uddhav Thackeray sitting in Mumbai to include the word 'secular' in the Common Minimum Program
 usee meeting main mukhyamantri, upmukhyamantri or vidhansabha adhyaksh ko lekar bhi congress ne baat kerani chaahi par sharad pavaar ne ye kahkar us par kuch faisla karne se manaa kar diya ki is par shivasena ke saamne hi baatcheet karnaa uchit hoga
 On the second day in the evening of 22 November, the leaders of the three parties met at the Nehru Center in Worli
 par vidhansabha adhyaksh ko lekar baat bighad gai
 According to sources, it happened that Ahmed Patel told Sharad Pawar that you had agreed to give the post of Speaker of the Assembly
 pavaar ko laga ki unhen jhootha tehraaya ja rahaa he isliye wo meeting bich me chhod kar nikal gaye
 After coming out, he kept the expectation of consensus on forming a government under Uddhav Thackeray
 lekin sharad pavaar ke is tarah se bich me uthakar jane se baar-baar kii meeting se pehle se naaraaz ajit pavaar ko laga ki ab wo apane chachaa ko bijepi ke saath jane ke liye manaa lenge
 He asked for two copies of the letter signed by the 54 mlas from the party office and reached out to Devendra Fadnavis and placed a condition that if the oath method is done in the morning, then he is ready to form the government with BJP
 unke paas 54 vidhayakon ke hastakshar vaale kaagaj the wo khud bhi ensipi vidhanmandal dal netaa the isliye bijepi unki baton main aa gai
 Sources reveal that Ajit Pawar claimed to come with 22 to 25 mlas if not 54, and also promised that he would convince his uncle i
e
 Sharad Pawar
 lekin duusare din hua ulta
 On the morning of 23 November, Pawar was surprised to see Ajit Pawar taking oath as Deputy Chief Minister along with Devendra Fadnavis but he again turned the situation in his favor like ed's notice
 subah sabase pehle shivasena party pramukh uddhav thakare ko phone kar sabakuch thik karne kaa bharosa dilaayaa or ajit pavaar ke saath gayi zyaadaatar vidhayakon ko waapas bulawaakar congress ko bhi sarkaar main shaamil hone par raji kar liya
 On November 25, the Supreme Court verdict was completed, which called for open voting and video recording of the majority
 ajit pavaar to apane ghar waapas chale gaye or maha vikaas aghadi sarkaar main upmukhyamantri ke daavedaar bhi hai lekin 5 saal safaltaapurvak mukhyamantri rahakar rajya bijepi ke kaddavar netaa ban chuke devendra fadanvis kii mitti paleed kar gayi

 At the age of 62, Anil Kapoor proved this as 'age is just a number'

 Often people wonder what Anil Kapoor eats or what kind of diet that looks so young

 The South Indian diet consists of healthy meals, which are rich in nutrients and yes the good thing is that they are not very high in calories

 Anil Kapoor also answered this question in his interview
 anil ne kaha ki unhen idli, sambar, chatnee, dosa or sabhi achaar bahut pasand he, jo ki chaaval ke saath liye jate hai
 Apart from this, he also gave rasam and curd a big reason, due to which he likes South Indian food
 anil kapur ne isi saajhaatkaar main kaha ki dakshin bhartiya aahaar main shaamil idli or dosa sehatmand aahaar hai
 When a person is ill, idli is usually given to them, as it is safe

 After all, who does not want to keep himself young - Anil Kapoor has told that he likes to take South Indian food
 lekin iske alaava ve kya khate hai yaa unki regular diet kisi hoti he yah ham aapako bataate hai-anil kapur ne yah sabit kar diya ki feet bane rahane ke liye aapako khud ko bhookha rakhane kii jarurat nahin he
 He sees himself as a foodie, often sharing posts related to food on Instagram

 paanch sau se zyada filmon main kaam kar chuke jabardast actor anupam kher philhal bollywood main filmon ke akaal se jujh rahe hai
 The small-budget film 'one Day Justice Delivered' released on Friday has not received much response from the audience
 is film main anupam kher ne jaj kii bhoomika nibhaai he
 Isha Gupta is also working in the film
 anupan ne apni raajnneetik stand ko bollywood main kaam kii kami kii vajah bataaya
 Anupam said that due to support of Bharatiya Janata Party, many people are trying to isolate him in the industry
 bibisi se baatcheet main anupam kher ne kaha, "zyaada se zyaada log kya kar lenge? mujhe kaam nahin denge
 i 99
 9 fisadi logon ke bich lokapriy hum or un 0
 01% is not needed for people who want to isolate me
 "anupam ne kaha, "ye bache log mujhe apni filmon main cast nahin karte hai
 But i am also no less, my name is included in the 10 influential Hollywood names
 sach kii raah main bahut akelaapan he, lekin usamen bahut taaqat hoti he or meri safalataa iskaa pramaan he
 "view this post on Instagram # onedayjusticedelivered releases today worldwide
 Thank you my director # ashoknanda, producers, writers, my co actors and technicians for your love and warmth during the making of the film
 It has been a pleasure being part of this intriguingly beautiful film
 Please go & watch it
 posta post shared byanupam Kher (@anupampkher) onjul 4, 2019 at 11:34 pm PDT Let us know that Anupam Kher does not currently have any Bollywood film
 ve ise apane kariyar kaa interval maanate hai
 Although the actor is working in the American series
 anupam kher kii haalia filmon ke chalate bhi unhen nishaanaa par liya jaataa rahaa he
 He played former PM Manmohan Singh in the film 'the Accidental Prime Minister'
 is film ko kai critics ne saaf taur par propagenda kaha tha taaki piem narendra modi ko loksabhaa chunaav main phayda mil sake
 Apart from this, the film did not earn much at the box office, but despite this, Anupam refuses to consider these films as agenda influenced films
 indore se kareeb 49 kimi dur agra-mumbai rashtriya rajmarg par basaa gram rampuria yun to kisi bhi aam gaanv jaisaa hi lagata he lekin yahaan ke logon ne paanch maah pehle ek aisa nirnay liya jisane unke gaanv ko ek anokhi pahchaan di he
 In October 2012, in the election of Gram Panchayat, a hundred percent women Gram Panchayat was unanimously formed here
 panchayat kii bagdor mahilaon ko saunpane kaa sakaaratmak parinaam dikhaai bhi dene laga he
 Sarpanch, a 32-year-old science graduate, has pioneered the literacy of the village women in collaboration with his fellow Panch, 24-year-old Anjali Patel, educated till 12th
 mini kahati hai, ‘‘hamane mahilaon ko roj do ghante padhaane kaa faisla kiya he
 First, the illiterate Panch women will be made literate
 ’’sarv mahila panchayat banane kii raah aasaan nahin thi
 Although there is a provision for keeping 50 percent of posts in Panchayati Raj Act for women, but when it was proposed to give all the posts of Panches including sarpanch to women, there was a lot of opposition as the post of sarpanch was not reserved for women
 pichley saal jab yahaan gram rampuria khurd or rampuria bujurg ko milakar banaai gai gram panchayat ke chunaav hone the to bijepi ke jila mahaamantri ashok somani ne purv sarpanch or congress ke jila mahaamantri nandakishor patel ko sarv mahila panchayat kaa prastaav diya
 Patel says, "the proposal was justified to end the hostility during the election
" ’’pahal aage badi or sabhi purush ummidavaaron ne aapasi sahmati se apane parche waapas lekar puri panchayat mahilaon ko saunpane kaa nirnay liya
 "most of the men who participate in power through reservation remain inactive in the Pradhan Panchayat," says Somani
 ’’ lekin sarv mahila panchayat main aisa hone kii ashanka bilkul nahin thi
 This decision taken for Rampuria Panchayat is important because it is a tribal dominated village
 yahaan 1,210 kii kul aabaadi main se 79 fisadi hissaa anusuchit janajati kaa he or panchon ke 10 padon main se chah isi varg ke liye arakshit hai
 Two posts are for Scheduled Castes, one post for Other Backward Classes while one post is for General Category
 lekin aam sahmati se saat pad anusuchit janajati kii mahilaon ko die gaye
 It was decided to hand over the responsibility of the post of sarpanch reserved for Scheduled Castes
 mini ko sarpanch chunane ke peeche kii vajah bhi unka padhaa-likhaa hona tha
 As soon as Sarpanch was formed, Mini decided to awaken the flame of education
 chunki gaanv ke praathmik vidhyalay main sirf ek niyamit shikshika or ek atithi shikshika hai jo paanch kakshaon ko sanbhaalane ke liye aparyaapt he, isliye mini ne khud bhi skool main bacchon ko padhaanaa shuru kar diya
 His next step was to make illiterate Panch women literate
 gaanv kii mahilaon kaa jivan sudhaarney kii disha main panchayat ne ek or pahal karte hue sharabbandi kaa prastaav paarit karne ke saath paryaavaran sudhaar kii disha main pahal karte hue pedo kii kataai par bhi roak lagaai
 However, the administrative section of the state is still unaware of this initiative of the village
 nirvirodh chuni gai panchayaton ko madhya pradesh sahit deshbhar main protsaahan raashi di jaati he
 But there is no separate incentive for unopposed Purna Mahila Panchayat
 pradesh ke saamaajik nyaay, panchayat evam gramin vikaas mantri gopal bhargav kehete hai, ‘‘purna mahila panchayat chunaa janaa acchhee pahal he
 Incentive amount will be considered for this
 adhikariyon ko sampurna databes banane ke nirdesh die gaye hai

 In fact, Sanoj Yadav, despite not being a RJD spokesperson, went to a television channel debate on June 22 where he was supposed to defend him on corruption charges against Lalu Prasad and his family
 magar sanoj yadav channel dibet ke dauraan lalu or unke parivaar waalon kaa bachaav karne main asamarth dikhe jisasetejpratap yadavnaraz ho gaye the

 Rahul Gandhi while referring to the 'chandrayaan 2' mission said that ISRO was created by the Congress
 rocket do din main nahin gaya, saalon lage hai
 Narendra Modi is taking advantage of it, but sending rockets to the moon will not feed the stomach of the youth of India
 haalanki, is uplabdhi ke liye unhone isro kii saraahna kii
 Addressing an election rally for the Congress candidate from Ausa Assembly seat in Latur district in Maharashtra, Rahul Gandhi said that the real objective of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah is to get people's attention in Corbett Park, Chand, China, Pakistan, Japan and Korea and others Wander towards the issues
 ve desh ke samaksh maujuud asal muddon par chuppi saadhe hue hai

 Recently during my visit to Gujarat, i came to know about the problems in textile and diamond industries, but the media is not saying a word in this regard

 If you ask the farmers about their situation, their answer will be: Modi ji has destroyed us

 In this video, Shraddha is saying - 'friends, the time for Diwali is near

 Before Shraddha, actress Esha Gupta was trolled for taking pictures of her
 haalanki bahut se stars trobers ke is tarah pesh aane ko lekar apni pratikriya nahin dete lekin isha gupta ne trobers ko munh tod jawaab diya tha
 Now it remains to be seen whether Shraddha also reacts to being trolled like this, because now safe and smoke free Diwali is not a personal interest but a public interest
