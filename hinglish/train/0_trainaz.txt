 bharat hameshaa se hi ek dharm sahishnu desh rahaa he
 Diversity of religion and culture has been the identity of this country for centuries
 mughalkaal main akbar jaise shaskaon ne dharmik sahishnutaa kii niti apanaayi
 The Mughal emperor Akbar abolished the jizya tax imposed on Hindus and got many Sanskrit texts translated into Persian
 unke darbar main pramukh kalakaaron or vidwaanon main hindu or muslim donon hi the
 According to historians, Akbar adopted many ways of Hinduism even in private life
 abraham irali ne apni kitaab 'emporars of da picock thron: da saaga of da great mughals' main akbar ke samakaleen itihaaskaar mullah abd-ul-kaadir badayunni (1540 - 1615) kaa hawala dete hue likhaa he ki akbar par uske hindu raja birbal kaa bada prabhaav tha
 abd-ul-qadir Badauni was an Indian historian and translator of Persian origin
 akbar ne inhen apane darbar main 1574 main islam dharm ke adhikari or salaahkaar rup main niyukt kiya tha, jahaan inhone apane jivan ke kai varsh vyateet kiye the
 According to Mullah Abdul Qadir Badauni, Birbal had great influence on the Mughal Emperor Akbar
 badayunni is baat ko pidaa ke saath likhte hai, 'birbal ne samraat akbar ko surya or agni kii puja ke liye taiyaar kar liya tha
 According to Badauni, under the influence of Birbal, Akbar started worshiping water, stones, trees and all natural elements
 yahaan tak ki vah gaay ke saamne jhukkar naman karata the or gaay ke gobar ko bhi khaas darja dete the
 'badauni has written,' Birbal encouraged Akbar to worship the sun
 birbal ne akbar ko tark diya ki surya sabhi ko prakaash detaa he or sabhi falon, phulon or prithvi ke utpaadon ko pakaane main madad karata he
 The Sun helps to keep a human alive, hence he should be worshiped
 'akbar ne khan-paan se sambandhit bhi kai disha-nirdesh die the
 Akbar banned the consumption of beef
 badayunni ne apni kitaab main likhaa he, 'bif ke seven par kadaa pratibandh isliye lagaaya gaya tha kyonki bif kaa seven pachan ke lihaaj se thik nahin mana gaya tha
 According to Badauni, there was a strong ban on the killing of animals on Sunday as it is considered to be the day of the Sun
 madhyakaal ke jane maane itihaaskaar harbans mukhiya kaa kahana he ki akbar ne jitna hindu taur tareekon ko apanaaya utana kisi or shaasha ne nahin apanaaya
 He not only worshiped Surya every day but also took 1000 names of Surya in Sanskrit

 The Delhi Commission for Women has rescued a 13-year-old girl from RK Puram area of delhi, who was being forcefully married to an older person
 ladki, jo ki anaath he, usne dilli mahila ayog kii 181 mahila helpline par shikaayat kii ki uske naanaa nani jabardastee uski shaadi karvaa rahe hai
 On receipt of the complaint, the commission formed a team and contacted on that number
 phone par ek aadmi ne baat kii or bataaya ki ek 13 saal kii ladki jyoti (naam parivartit) kii jabardastee shaadi kii ja rahi he
 The commission team immediately reached the area and asked people about the wedding of a girl named Jyoti
 vahaan logon se koi santoshjanak jawaab nahin mila, lekin ayog kii team jyoti ko talash karti rahi or har ghar main poochtacha kii
 At one place, a girl was filling water near a public water tank, the commission team asked her about Jyoti
 usne ishaare se bataaya kii vahi jyoti he or usne apane ghar kii taraf bhi ishaara kiya
 She kept on filling the water and the commission team also pretended to search, during which the team of the commission gave information to the police and called
 police kii sahaayta se ladki ke mamaa or aasapaas ke logon ke virodh ke baavjood usko uske ghar se rescue karvaa liya gaya
 The girl looked very scared in the police station, she told that her real name is something else, she used Jyoti name only to call
 13 varshiya ladki ne bataaya ki vah karnataka se he
 Her parents have died, so she lives here with her maternal grandfather, grandmother and maternal uncle
 kuch samay pehle usko pataa chalaa ki uske mamaa usko 19 april ko karnataka le jane kii yojana bana rahe hai taaki vah uski shaadi apane jaan-pahchaan ke ek aadmi se kara sake jo ki umr main ladki se bahut bada he
 She told that she was opposed to this marriage and she told her grandparents many times about it
 kahin se koi sahaayta na milane par usne ek ajanabi vyakti kaa phone lekar dilli mahila ayog kii 181 helpline par phone kiya
 She first saw the Commission's mobile helpline car in her area, and she knew about the 181 helpline beforehand, as some of the women there called the Commission's assistance by calling 181 in cases of domestic violence
 jyoti ne bataaya ki vah paanchavin tak padhi hui he or usko aage bhi padhai kerani he
 The girl was produced before the Child Welfare Committee after medical examination from where she was sent to the shelter home
 dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksha swati maliwal ne kaha, “yah bahut prashansa kii baat he ki ladki ne apane parivaar se ladane or ayog kii 181 helpline par phone karne main itani himmat dikhaai
 The commission and its 181 women's helpline are working round the clock to support women and girls
 ham yah bhi sunishchit karenge ki ladki ke rishtedaaron par uski jabardastee shaadi karaane ke liye exiaar darj ho
 " rajdhani dilli main badmaash kitne bekhauf hai iskaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki teen badmaash ek raat main teen jagah par vaardaat karte hai
 These miscreants travel on a stolen bike, their pictures are also recorded in CCTV cameras, but even after hours pass, the police are not able to catch these miscreants
 pehali ghatana pandav nagar ilaake kii he
 Here an event decorator was returning from work, this man named Hukumchand arrived at night to give his brother-in-law a car
 is shaks ne rishtedaar ke ghar ke saamne jaise hi apni car roki, teen hathiyaar band badmaash uske paas pahunche or hathiyaar ke bal par uske saath lutpaat kar faraar ho gaye
 The miscreants also looted 23000 cash and mobile from Hukumchand
 badmaashon ko dekhte hi uski bahan ne shor machaa diya varanaa wo uski gadee bhi luutane vaale the
 In the second incident, the miscreants also stole a bike from the same area
 haalanki badmaash lutpaat karte hue is ilaake main lage sisitivi main kaid ho gaye hai
 The third incident after the robbery and bike theft in Pandav Nagar is of Model Town
 yahaan par inhen badmaashon ne vyapaaree ke saath lutpaat kii jab vah apane parivaar ke saath der raat lagbhag sava teen baje ghar laut rahaa tha
 This businessman was parking the car inside his house
 jaise hi usne ghar kaa darwaja kholaa, teenon lutere vahaan pahunche or hathiyaaron ke bal par lut ko anjaam dekar faraar ho gaye
 All these three incidents take place on the same night
 This means that these three miscreants steal a bike in Pandav Nagar and sit on the same stolen car and reach Model Town and carry out the crime there
 hairaani kii baat he ki is bich kisi bairicade par na to unhen roka gaya or na hi petroling daste ne unhen rokane kii jahamat uthaai
 Another incident of shoot-by-crook absconding took place at Bhalswa police station in outer Delhi

 The triple talaq bill will be introduced in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday and the government will also debate it
 pehle yah bill mangalvaar ko hi rajyasabha main aana tha, lekin vipakshi dalon main aam raay nahin ho paane ke kaaran sarkaar ne ise mangalvaar ko pesh karnaa uchit nahin samajha

 The government wants that the way the bill is passed in the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha should also pass the bill in the same manner without any change
 ise raashtrapati ke paas dastakhat ke liye bheja ja sake or yah fouran kanoon ban sake
 In the Rajya Sabha's Business Advisory Committee, the government told the opposition parties that this bill is included in the government's priority and the government wants to pass it as soon as possible under all circumstances
 vipakshi partiyon kii taraf se sarkaar ko koi thos aashwaasan nahin mila ki vah is bill ko select cameti bhejne yaa phir isamen kuch sanshodhan karne ke liye sadan main dabaav nahin daalenge

 The Congress party is already on the backfoot due to repeated references to Shahbano during the debate in the Lok Sabha and does not want to put too much hurdle in the matter
 bijepi ke netaa subramanyam swami ne saaf kaha ki is bill ko lekar sarkaar ke donon haathon main laddu he agar bill paas hota he to sarkaar ko iskaa shrey milegaa or agar vipakshi partiyaan is bill ko paas nahin hone detii hai to un ko benakaab karne kaa hamen mauka milegaa
 According to experts, if the government is unable to pass this bill on Wednesday and the opposition parties insist on sending the bill to the Select Committee, then the government will be ready to send it to the Select Committee
 rajyasabha main sarkaar ke paas bahumat nahin he, lekin yah ek aisa bill he jiske paas nahin ho paane kii haalat main bhi sarkaar iskaa raajnneetik phayda uthaaegi or iskaa virodh karne waalon ko aage aane vaale chunaav main nishaanaa banaaegi

 ) Gold prices are touching the sky on Akshaya Tritiya
 lekin ophers ke dam par jewalers acchhee bikri kii ummid laga kar baithe hai
 Due to the huge increase in the prices of gold, experts are expecting the sale of gold to be slow this time even on the festival like Akshaya Tritiya
 akshay tritiya ke maukey par aamtaur par sone kii demand badhati he
 Then the price of gold increased, just before the Akshaya Tritiya, the price of gold has again increased significantly
 lekin ye shubh mauka or jewalers ke ofer abhi bhi graahakon ko apni ore khinchenge
 Buying gold on Akshaya Tritiya is considered auspicious
 is baar jo baat sawalia nishaan laga rahi he wo he sone kii aasmaan chooti keemat
 Even after the increase in prices, people will buy gold on Akshaya Tritiya
 At the beginning of this year, the price of gold sold at the rate of about 25 thousand rupees per 10 grams has increased by about 20 percent
 ab sone kaa daam 30 hajaar rupye prati das gram ke str tak pahunch gaya he
 It is feared that this rise in prices may keep gold customers away from it on Akshaya Tritiya
 lekin jewalers daawa kar rahe hai ki daamon kaa akshay tritiya kii sone kii maang par kuch khaas asar nahin padegaa
 According to him, people who consider this auspicious will buy gold even if the price increases
 tyohaar par khaas ofravahin graahak bhi maanate hai ki daam badhane kaa asar akshay tritiya par jewalers ke khaas ofer se kuch kam to hua he
 For example, many jewelers are giving discounts on this occasion perking
 mekking chargees kai baar jewelery kii kaarigari ke mutabik uski keemat ke 10 fisadi yaa usase zyada bhi ho sakate hai
 In this discount, the customers get a great relief in prices
 wo is shubh avasar par apni pasandida dhaatu ko ek achche shagun ke taur par kharid sakate hai
 Some customers believe that in the long term, the price of gold increases
 to investment ke lihaaj se ophers ke lihaaj se kharidari ke liye ye mauka bhi thik he
 Gold prices have fluctuated greatly over the years
 pichley 10 saal main hi sone ke daam kareeb 5 guna tak bad chuke hai
 In such a situation, the increase in the price of gold can reduce its demand but cannot end it

 Please tell that Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan took responsibility from the Taliban for shooting the head of the then schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai
 yah pakistan ke swat ghati main 2012 kii he
 That spokesman also claimed responsibility for the attack on a school in Pakistan that killed more than 150 people

 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's departure from power is almost certain
 isroyal main gathbandhan kii sarkaar banane main vifal rahane ke baad somvaar ko netanyahu ne satta ke liye sangharsh chhod diya he
 With this, the way has opened for Netanyahu's rival Benny Gantz to take over power
 jab netanyahu nai sarkaar gathit karne main safal nahin hue, to isroyal ke raashtrapati reven revlin ne kaha ki ab wo purv army chif benni gantj ko bahumat jutaney or sarkaar banane kaa mauka denge
 If Benny Gantz manages to form the government, he will become the first person to form a government in Israel after Netanyahu for more than a decade
 ab isroyal main gathbandhan kii sarkaar banane ke liye benni gantj ko 28 din ke andar bahumat jutanaa hoga
 However, it will not be easy for Benny Gantz to bring mps from other parties into his court and get a majority
 aapako bataa den kiisroyal ke aam chunaav main kisi dal ko spasht bahumat nahin mila he
 In this election, a group of right-wing parties led by Benjamin Netanyahu won 55 seats in the 120-member parliament, while the opposition parties won a total of 57 seats
 is chunaav main isroyal ke purv army chif benni gantj kii blue and white party ne 33 siten jiti he, jabaki pradhanmantribenjamin netanyahooki likud party ko 32 siton se hi santosh karnaa padaa he
 Israeli lawmakers have also taken the oath of the new parliament, ie Knesset, without the formation of a new government
 paanch maheene main 17 sitambar ko hue chunaav main isroyal kii janata ne duusari baar vot daalaa tha

 Regarding the Gujarat Rajya Sabha election, Shankar Singh Vaghela said that i did not vote for Ahmed Patel
 congress ko vot dene kaa matlab hi nahin he
 However, he also said that i regret not voting for Ahmed Patel
 isse purv haal hi main congress kaa daaman chhodane vaale varisht netaa shankar singh waghela ne rajyasabha chunaav main ahamed patel ke samarthan ko lekar somvaar ko bhi pattey saafe nahin kiye the
 In a conversation with Srinivasan Jain of NDTV, he admitted that he had a very old and good relationship with Ahmed Patel, but Vaghela deferred the question of supporting him
 haalanki unhone saaf kar diya tha ki kya karnaa he, is par unhone apana man bana liya he
 Read: CM Vijay Rupani of Gujarat said - We will win all the three seats of Rajya Sabha from Gujarat
 kya aap ahamed patel kaa samarthan karenge ke sawaal par unhone kaha tha ki har voter apane khud ke vot kaa maalik hota he
 i have good relations with Ahmed Bhai Patel, i have discussed with him
 isliye kya karnaa he or kya nahin karnaa he ye mere or ahamed patel kaa aapasi maamla he
 This is my personal thinking, my personal decision
 kise vot karnaa he, kise nahin karnaa he ye koi sawaal nahin he
 It is not that i have to take a decision in the last moment
 maine pehle hi apana man bana liya he
 On the question of what are your equations with Ahmed Patel, he said - In 1977, when i was elected as Lok Sabha MP from the part of Janata Party, Ahmed Bhai was associated with Congress
 tab se hi ham achche dost hai
 i used to visit his house too
 aaj bhi hamaare sambandh bahut achche hai
 This morning we also discussed on the phone
 kal bhi wo mujhe phone karenge
 We will meet each other even after the 8th

 Our relationship is different from a political party

 Therefore, what to do and what not to do is a mutual matter between me and Ahmed Patel

 kya modi sarkaar ne chardhaam kii yatra ke liye shandaar four-len kii sadak bana kar taiyaar kar di he? is samay soshal media par ek tasviir ke jariye thik yahi daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 The India Today anti-fake News Room (AFWA) found in its investigation that this claim is completely false
 jis shandaar sadak ko chardhaam kaa rasta bataaya ja rahaa he wo bharat kii nahin balki morocco kii tasviir he
 On 16 April, a Facebook user named Raghav Varshney shared this photo showing a magnificent road in which the mountains are seen on one side and the water's edge on the other side
 is photo kaarkive yahandekha ja saktaa he
 The caption of the viral photo read, "it is not a Switzerland but a four lane road to travel to Chardham in Uttarakhand, India, what Modi has done is true"
 fasebuk par daali gai is photo ko khabar likhe jane tak1100 se bhi zyaada log share kar chuke hai or 250 logon ne isapar coment bhi kar chuke hai
 Looking at the photo shared, at first sight, it is doubtful that it cannot be the road of Chardham as the sea is seen on the side of the road
 photo main ye bhi dekha ja saktaa he ki is sadak par sabhi gaadiyaan sadak ke dahini taraf chal rahi hai jabaki bharat main gaadiyaan baayin taraf chalati hai
 In Google reverse image search, we saw that this photo, which has the name of Gharbaoui on the bottom left, has been used variously by all the people
 yahi photo hamen kai aise logon ke fasebuk or towitor par mili jo uttari africa ke desh morocco ke rahane vaale he
 Through reverse search, we found a photo on pintest which claimed that this photo is from the city of Tangier in Morocco
 hamane iske baad google arth pro par tangier shahar kii satellite footage dekhi or ham uske jaisi hoobahoo dikhne vaali sadak tak tak pahunch gaye
 Almost all the signs of the road shown in the map and in the viral photo are matching
 ek jaise mode, footpath, pathar, street lite kii parchaai, sab kuch photo jaise hi dikhaai pad rahe hai
 On discovering the pictures of Tangier area on the famous travel website Tripadvisor, we came to know that this photo is from this road
 is photo ko ''tangier trips'' naam ke ek yuzar ne tripsedwiser par isi maheene aplod kiya he
 The Char Dham roadway project was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2016
 2018 main ise neshnalgreen tribuneldvara hari jhandi dikhaai gai
 But project details show that these roads will be constructed in two lanes and not in four lanes
 in tathyon ke aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki is sadak ko chardhaam kaa bataanaa saraasar galat he
 Radhika Apte is going to be seen again in the film Padman adorned with her best performance
 is film main wo akshay kumaar kii patni kaa role karengi
 Recently during the promotion of this film from Radhika, she shared her experience related to periods
 unhone bataaya ki jab mujhe pehali baar periods hue to maa ne ghar main party di or parivaar ke logon ne ek rist watch gift kii
 Pagle Hero Akshay's first song out of Padman, Arijit's romantic voice Radhika is also questioned about why people do not talk about the subject even today
 unhone bataaya ki unke ghar main zyaadaatar log doctor hai or vah doctor family se aati he
 So there was not that kind of atmosphere there
 hamaare ghar main is par baat nahin karne jaisi koi baat nahin thi
 Superhero Akshay Kumar, who was seen distributing sanitary napkins, said that at the event, Akshay Kumar said that we will try to show the way in which the toilet film we have brought to the common man is also shown on Doordarshan
 ham aage bhi samaaj ko jaagruk karne vaali filmein banane kii koshish karenge
 Akshay said that i have also talked to all the ministers of the government, the film should be transported to the village and to such remote areas where people have doubts to talk about all these topics and do not talk openly
 rili life story par bani he pedmanbta den arunachalam muruganatham kii jindagi se prerit film 'pedman' kaa trailor bhi logon ne bahut pasand kiya tha
 The trailer begins with the voice of Amitabh Bachchan, in which he is heard saying that America has Superman, Batman, Spiderman, but India has Padman
 film main akshay kumaar, radhika apte or sonam kapur lead role main hai
 Radhika is the wife of Akshay
 film main akshay sanetary napkin banane kii mashin banaate hai, jisase saste daam par gaanv kii mahilaon ko sanetary napkin muhaiyaa karai ja sake
 However, Akshay's work makes his wife feel embarrassed
 saath hi gaanvvaale bhi unka majaak udaate hai
 Actually Akshay sees that women use cloth during periods, which causes them diseases
 isliye wo unke liye sanetary napkin bananaa shuru karte hai
 The attraction of the Naini Lake of Nainital is such that the tourists themselves get drawn here
 jo yahaan ek baar aata he wo baar-baar aana chahta he
 Now it is another matter that Naini lake itself is fighting for survival
 naini jhil sookhne ke kagaar par pahunch gai he
 Considered to be the only source of water supply in the city of Nainital in summer, the water level of Naini Lake has fallen 18 feet below normal
 ye naini jhil or nainital donon ke liye khatre kii ghanti he
 Such condition of Naini lake has increased the concern of experts
 bhu-vaigyanik is jhil kii umr sirf 25 varsh aank rahe hai
 Despite this, the greed of man is not being named
 paryaavarnavid naini jhil kii durdasha ke liye iske aasapaas andhadhundh nirmaan, pedo ke girane, jal kshetra ko kancreet se paatane or aabhohawaa main badlaav ko jimmedaar tehraate hai
 The lush green forests of three more hills of the lake have turned into cement buildings in the last half century
 naini jhil ke sookhne kii sabase badi vajah isaki sahaayak jhil 'sookhaa taal' kaa makaanon se dhak janaa he
 Naini lake got 40% of the water from the dry pool throughout the year
 lekin sookhtal ke mahatv ko nazarandaaj kiye jane se ye vaaki apane naam ke anuroop hi naini jhil ke liye suukh gaya he
 Drought pool is a wetland
 jisaki khaasiyat barish ke dinon main bhar jane or baaki dinon main daldaleey rahane kii he
 From here the water used to percolate into Naini Lake
 lekin ab sookhaatal makaanon se dhake hone ke saath hi sarkari vibhaagon kaa danpyard adhik najar aata he
 In the nineteenth century there is evidence of 321 water sources found in the watershed of Naini Lake
 yahaan se pani naini jhil main pahunchataa tha
 But most of the water sources have dried up as the concrete jungle rises everywhere
 mana jaataa he ki ab 10 fisadi jal strot bhi nahin bache hai
 The British developed drains now bring debris instead of water into the lake
 naini jhilka jalastr neeche girane kii ek vajah beete do saal se sardiyon ke mausam main hone vaali barish kaa naa hona bhi he
 The lake has become dunes due to continuous fall in water level
 lok nirmaan vibhaag (PWD) jhil se gaad (silt) nikalwane kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 But just as the natural sources that recharge the lake are drying up, if there is no initiative for their conservation, the situation in Naini Lake cannot be improved
 saath hi jis tarah nainital kii aabaadi har din bad rahi he, tourist kaa dabaav he, us sthiti main puure shahar ke liye pani kaa akelaa strot naini jhil or kitne saal tak vajood banaae rakh saktaa he
 If Naini Lake and Nainital city are to be saved, it is absolutely necessary to take drastic steps
 inamen monsoon khatm hote hi pani kii rashning karnaa bhi ek upaay he
 If this was done in advance, the water level of Naini lake would not have fallen so much
 nainizil kii khubasaratinainital ko duusare hill stations se alag banaati he
 If Naini lake itself is in danger today, then the existence of Nainital is also going to be questioned
 pakistan ke punjab praant main rawalpindi jile ke gurudwara hasal abdal main baisakhi utsav manaane ke liye bharat se 1400 se adhik sikh buudhvaar ko lahore pahunche

 So on the other side, in this battle of getting justice for him, all his helpers are going to turn
 28 july ko raibareli jate hue accident main maare gaye peedita ke rishtedaaron or is maamle ke gavaahon kaa aakhir sangeenon ke saae main antim sanskaar kar diya gaya
 In this battle of justice, the victim is now slowly falling apart
 unnav ke is gaanv main antim sanskaar ho rahaa he
 Of law, of justice, of dignity, of right and of right
 un tasveeron se najar naa feriye
 Because ignoring these pictures means that you can face you, us and any Indian like you with such pictures
 vaise to wo ek behad aam mahila kii aakhri vidaai he
 But the relation of that woman is that girl whose honor was demolished on the land of this Unnao
 ji haa unnav rape cond kii peedita kii chachee kaa buudhvaar ko antim sanskaar kar diya gaya
 The same aunt who was badly injured in the road accident with the victim and could not survive after constant efforts by doctors
 unnav rape cond main peedita kii ek madadgaar ko khamosh kar diya gaya he
 Peedita's aunt was standing with her full strength in the battle of justice
 raibareli se chand kilometre dur jis car ko kaalikh puti plate vaale trek ne chakanachur kar diya usamen peedita kii chachee bhi thi
 The father left, the aunt left
 chachaa bhi jail main hai
 After the legal process, the uncle was taken to the village for the last rites
 ye cese itnaa sangeen or itnaa pechida he ki khud dm ko chand ghante kii jamaanat ke kagajaat lekar jail aana padaa
 The victim's uncle was taken to the village under very tight security
 ye us parivaar kii badanasibi he ki uskaa saamana ek aise taqatvar shaks se he jiske daaman par haath daalane kii jurrat desh kii sabase badi or sarvashakti sampann party bhi nahin kar paa rahi he
 If the name of Kuldeep Sengar, BJP MLA from Unnao, had not been sprung up in this case, the family would have got a chance to mourn with the untimely demise of at least one member
 lekin dekh lijie lakhanu se unnav tak is parivaar ke saath sirf or sirf suraksh kaa gheraa he
 Away from well-wishers, this family is struggling with its sorrow and misfortune
 unnav rape cese ek test cese he
 For the system where the rape victim is stumbling rate-by-death for a daughter, Justice, is facing death in the ICU today
 agar usne dam tod diya to kanoon or nyaay vyavastha par bharose kaa bhi dam ghut jayega
 There were threats in the presence of the police as well
 The accident on the road from Rae Bareli to Unnao was accidental on July 28 or the incident can be revealed from the footage of that CCVT
 jo mauka-e-vaardaat se mahaz 8 kimi dur ek toll plaza kii he
 The victim's Maruti car had passed this toll before the accident
 vaardaat kii team ne toll par lage is sisitivi ke footage ko dhund nikaala
 In which the victim's car is clearly seen passing through the toll
 ye tasviren usee toll plaza par lage sisitivi ke camere kii he
 The victim's family says that sometimes with alcohol, sometimes with weapons
 to kabhi darjanabhar gunde bijepi vidhayak kuldeep senger ke ishaare par har din rape peedita ke ghar aate the
 Used to threaten him
 parivaar ko jaan se maarane kii dhamkee dete the
 And used to go
 or to or mobile kaa camera on hone ke baad bhi unki gundai khatm nahin hoti thi
 The only difference was that then they used to call the victim their sister
 aisa hi ek video main dekha ja saktaa he ki sharaab ke nashe main chur neeli tishart pahane ek shaks bhi peedita ko dhamkaane aayaa tha
 But when the victim turned on the mobile camera, it changed its tone
 dhamkee dete dete ye peedita ko apni bahan or uske parivaar ko apana parivaar bataane laga
 But even then it went on threateningly saying that they will always come
 zindagi he parivaar he
 Then i will come bataaya jaataa he ki pichley ek saal main koi bhi aisa din nahin guzara jab kuldeep senger ke in gundon ne rape peedita yaa uske parivaar waalon ko dhamkaaya nahin
 Fed up, the rape victim requested the police and administration in writing 35 times in 365 days
 ashanka jataai
 The evidence presented that the people of BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar are in danger of life to him and his family members
 magar vidhayak ke logon par karrwai karne ke bajaae upi kii police or kanoon ne use ansuna kar diya
 365 days, 35 written complaints, every tenth day of the careless police year, Unnao's gang rape victim or her family molested in front of the police
 baar-baar madad kii bheekh maangata rahaa
 But the fear of power over Unnao police and administration was such that he did not hear the fate of this unfortunate person
 naa uske dard ko ye samaj paae
 It is possible that they have not wanted to understand
 salbhar aise hi chalata rahaa
 He did not desist from threatening the rape victim and did not agree to act on them despite a police written complaint
 ye sab tab ho rahaa tha jab unnav kii gang rape peedita ko ek nahin do nahin das das surakshakarmi mili hue the
 Had Unnao taken action on one of the 35 written complaints of the victim given to the police in 365 days, the victim's aunt and aunt would have been alive today
 or wo khud bhi zindagi or maut kii jang naa lard rahi hoti
 But it seemed as if the entire police and administration of Unnao had put cotton in their ears
 or wo kuldeep senger ke gundon ko khamosh rah kar shah de rahe the
 Now the remaining members of the victim's family also suspect that the accused BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar may also target them
 accident ke baad maamle ne tool pakadaa
 As soon as 35 complaints were reported in 365 days of the victim
 unnav police baikfoot par aa gai
 Under heavy media pressure, he had to admit that he had received complaints from the victim, but Unnao police said that he could not find the strength in these complaints
 ab lakhanu se unnav pahunche police ke aalaa adhikariyon ne is maamle se taalluk rakhane vaale tamaam pulisavaalon ko linehaazir kar diya he
 And every complaint of the victim is being investigated
 sutron ke mutabik peedita or uske parivaar ne apni likhit shikayaton main is baat kaa saaf zikr kiya he ki kuldeep senger ke gunde surakshakarmiyon kii maujuudagi main bhi aate the or dhamkee dete the
 But the security personnel deployed in the security were sitting hand in hand
 police ke saamne dhamkee kaa ek video pesh karne ke baavjood upi police ne maamla tak darj nahin kiya

 ham hindi main nirmala putul or anuj lugun kii kavitaaon main adivaasiyon kii vyathaa kaa nirupan dekh chuke hai
 In the same sequence, the first poetry collection of Anna Madhuri Tirkey, a poetess of Menderbahar village in Jashpur district of Chhattisgarh, has come up with some stinging questions amid the lukewarm tweet of poetry from the banks of Sonajori
 uraanv parivaar kii yah kavyitri apni kavitaaon ko dukh kaa raag kahati he
 Through these poems, his aim is to give voice to his district
 sonajori ke madhyam se tirki ne bhumandalikaran kii falshruti, jivan main ghus aae chal-chhadam or pralobhanon kii baangi pesh kii he
 Critic Lakshmi Narayan Payodhi has rightly written in the role that "in these poems, innumerable zonal words like Potong, Bemata, Naur, Mahua, Jatangi are not fashioned like fashion, they are full of their personality, dhaj, dhaak and expressiveness
" They have come together as the power of poetry
 ”jane-maane kaviyon kii kavitaayen to ham praaia: padhate hi hai par kabhi-kabhi nae kaviyon kii kavitaaon main jo taazgi or nayaapan miltaa he, uskaa ahlad hi alag hota he
 In the very first verse from the coast of Sonjori, Tirkey says: Now the flowers of jatangi do not blossom in Sonjori's hair, teak forest ropes have been placed on her chest
 aam kaa ped, bemata or bachche kavita main kavyitri ne ped or manushya ke rishton ko nikat se mahasoos kiya he: ped ko nahin yaad / kisne boyaa / dharti kii kokh main / uskaa beej / kisne sinchaa snehajal se / kisne di khaad / jabase hosh sambhala / khud ko akelaa paaya / jabase shaakhon main bor aayaa / logon ko uske liye / ladate paaya
 This is an intensive inspection of Tirkey
 isi tarah hukudapump (nal) main vikaas ke naam par sari khushhaali sarpanch ke daravaaje najar aati he
 But Ajjipacho (old grandmother) of this poem knows that in the next election all accounts will be equal
 uski to keval yahi khwaahish he ki yah hukdapump gaanv ke bichobich lage, jise / sab laga saken / haath / jiske hathe ko / hilaaein to / kare nahin mahaj / hukud-hukud
 
 
 / Sprang from the mouth / water / and / to the village / nihal
 kavyitri ko is baat kii phikr he ki maanavtaa ke is mahaavan main vasant kab aayega? vah in kavitaaon main sundarataa kii nai paribhaasha gadhati he
 The yellow dahlia attracts him, so the sun shines brightly in the sun, provided that we are tested for labor
 par jis tarah sapanom ko raundne kii sajishein chal rahi hai, vah kahati he: khwahishen paidaa hi na hotin / agar maaloom hota / anjaam itnaa bhayaavah hoga
 She comes out of the prevailing alphabet and says: Read me alphabet is not something that is known to me / 'A far apple', because neither she is known, nor is she acquainted with her taste
 'na’ se nal bhi nahin balki 'nadi’ sikhie kyonki nadi kareeb he meri samaj ke
 There are many poems here on the mother, expressing her gratitude for love, condolences and her great heart
 inamen anuraagmyata se bhari kavitaayen bhi hai, niyati or satya ke sweekaar kii bhi—par puure sangrah ko pard kar praaia: lok jivan main rache-based udhaas jivan-sangeet kaa saakshaatkaar hota he
 This is Tirkey's first collection, even though slightly inferior to the siddha young poets, whose poetry contains a vision of the soul's clean basement, where the truth of tribal sensation breathes
 itane naanaa prakaar ke pedo, vanaspatiyon kaa zikr inamen he jo yah jataata he ki anna ne apni samvednaa ko shahari jivan se nahin, 'sonajori ke tat’ kii nami or aabhohawaa se sinchaa he
 Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal, in a special interview given to Aaj Tak's chief correspondent Anurag Dhanda, discussed the future of AAP, its mistakes and the turmoil going on within the party
 kya hoga ‘‘aap’’ kaa?aap ek saal puraani party he
 We have got four seats
 dilli main vot pratishat 29 se 34 hua he, vah bhi aise vakt jab bispi, sapa, jediu khatm ho gai
 i do not give it up
 ham raajnneeti badalane ke liye aae hai
 We said that criminals should not come in politics, today Modi ji is saying the same thing
 modi bhrashtachariyon ko hataane kii baat kah rahe hai
 In such a situation, what will be the relevance of you? Do, now it is just a matter
 raajnneeti saaf ho jaati hai to hamaari jarurat nahin padegi
 Have the AAP leaders gone awry after the electoral defeat? Questions have always arisen within the party
 tihaad se baahar aane ke agle hi din maine dilli ke saare walantirs kii meeting lee thi
 There were many questions among volunteers
 jinka maine jawaab bhi diya
 People wrote me an e-mail
 lekin unke mail ko koi hack kar legaa, sochaa nahin tha
 He wrote in the Confidence that it would only reach me
 manish kii chitthee main zikr tha ki aap dilli tak simit rahanaa chaahate the, lekin kuch logon ne dabaav banaaya
 Yes maine kaha tha ki hamen loksabhaa chunaav nahin laduya chahie
 But many people of the party turned against me
 meraa maananaa tha ki hamen loksabhaa main dilli ke andar yaa aas-paas ke do-teen rajyon main hi laduya chahie
 This shows that i do not do everything in the party
 kehete hai ki aap faisle jaldbaaji main lete hai or baad main pachhataate hai
 We believe that politics is low to us
 sikh rahe hai, dhire-dhire sikh jaaenge
 There is regret in bringing down the government in Delhi? We thought that the Lokpal could not pass the bill and if he remained on the chair, the public would say, look, Kejriwal has become greedy for power
 hamane sochaa ki istipha nahin diya to janata bahut naaraaz hogi
 Did you know that the public would be angry if he resigned
 aap kaa teji se ubharna, phir loksabhaa main dilli kii saat main se ek bhi seat na milanaa, kaise dekhte hai?sar puure desh main jo aandhi chal rahi thi, usamen khadey rahanaa or duusare number par aana or vot share badhanaa bahut badi baat he
 Now Kejriwal does not perform sit-in-place, but writes a letter to Narendra Modi
 jarurat hogi to dharna -pradarshan bhi karenge

 Because of this feat, Budhia Singh's name was recorded in the 'limca Book of Records'
 budhiya ke paas tallent tha, lekin afsos paisa nahin tha
 His mother Sukanti Singh is the only one who earns in Budhia's house
 budhiya ke pitaaji kaa kai saal pehle dehanth ho chukaa he
 The comments budhiya ke tallent ko dekhte hue bhubaneshwar ke judo coach biranchi das use apane paas rakhkar trening de rahe the or budhiya kaa kharchaa uthaa rahe the, lekin 2008 main biranchi das kii hatya ho jane ke baad budhiya kii zindagi badal gai

 Budhia's mother Sukanti Singh says that she does not want to send Budhia back to the hostel again

 ' budhiya bhubaneshwar kaa sai hostel chhod chukaa he

 Budhia Singh, living in the slum of Bhubaneswar, attracted the attention of everyone by completing the 65 km distance from Puri to Bhubaneswar in 2006 in seven hours and two minutes
 is karname kii vajah se budhiya singh kaa naam 'limca book of records' main darj hua tha
 Budhia had talent, but regrettably no money
 budhiya ke ghar main kamaane vaali sirf uski maa sukanti singh he
 Budhia's father died many years ago

 ab use doosraa koi training dene ke liye aage nahin aayaa
 As a result, Budhia had to return to her home
 garibi kii vajah se vah kahin acchhee jagah trening nahin le paaya
 Then, given the talent and circumstances of Budhia Singh, the Odisha government trained Budhia by placing her in a Sports Authority of India (SAI) hostel and got her admitted to DAV Public School
 odisha sarkaar budhiya kaa puraa kharchaa uthaati thi, lekin budhiya singh hostel main di ja rahi training se khush nahin tha

 amuman sarkari chhot garibon or asaaayon ke liye hoti he, lekin in sari suvidhaon kaa phayda rais or rasukhdaar jaise log bhi jamkar uthaate rahe hai
 Now time is probably changing and such rich people are showing courage to say no to these concessions
 haalanki aise logon kii sankhya ginati main hi he
 Telangana Chief Minister k Chandrasekhar Rao is also among those who have been taking advantage of government concessions till now
 lekin mukhyamantri raav ne ab kheti par milane vaali sabsidi nahin lene kaa faisla kiya he
 He will voluntarily waive the exemption of Rs 8,000 per acre every year
 is saal may tak puure rajya main 71 lakh kisaanon ko yah sabsidi di jaani he
 He will be the first farmer in the state to do so
 karjamaafee se badi musiibat, bainkon par krishi karj kaa boj 23% badhkar hua 60 hajaar karodagas par logon ne nahin chodi chhotrav farvari main kisaanon ko die jane vaale sabsidi sambandhit nae disha-nirdesh jari karne ke baad yah ghoshnaa karenge
 This 'renunciation' of Chief Minister Rao, including 'rich farmers', including many ministers, mps, mlas, IAS, IPS, many officers of group-i, including many big people, will encourage them to make such 'sacrifices'
 in logon ke liye aise aarthik madad kii koi darkaar nahin he kyonki aise log to nammaatr ke hi kisaan hai
 Dangerous poison in your food plate, Ministry of Agriculture issued a warning, although there is still doubt that this campaign of Rao will be more successful
 centre sarkaar kii ore se sampann logon dwaara alpiji gas chhodane kaa abhiyaan rajya main puri tarah se naakaam rahaa
 There are about 9 million LPG gas consumers in Telangana state, of which only 5 per cent is 4
 90 lakh logon ne yah sabsidi chhodane kaa faisla liya
 It was Rao who decided to give financial assistance to the farmers to the owners of all types of arable land in the state, so as to prevent the social or economic irregularities
 mukhyamantri ko 6
 8 lakh help Chief Minister Chandrashekhar Rao has about 85 acres of land in Iraveli near the city, according to which he claims 6 every year
 8 lakh rupye banataa he
 The government has to provide Rs 5,600 crore to all 71 thousand farmers of the state till the Kharif crop
 november main rabi fasal ke liye inhen kisaanon ko 5,000 karod or dene honge
 In this way, the state will have an additional burden of more than 10 thousand crore rupees in a year
 rajya sarkaar ne 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan 17,500 karod rupye kisaan karj maaf karne kaa vaada kiya tha, iske 4 saal main jaakar rajya sarkaar bainkon ko 4 kishton main yah bhugtan kar saki thi
 Now, every year the assistance of 10 thousand crores given to the farmers will only increase the economic burden on the state
 haalanki iskaa makasad kamjor kisaanon kii kheti ke liye raah aasaan karnaa tha
 If the rich people appeal to leave it voluntarily, then this will save 500 crores in the state's account every year
 15 fisadi kisaan hai 'sampann'krishi vibhaag ke anusaar, telugana rajya main 62 fisadi kisaanon ke paas 2
 The land is less than 5 acres, while 24 per cent of the farmers have 2
 5 se 5 acre, 11 pratishat kisaanon ke paas 5 se 10 acre or 3 fisadi se kam logon ke paas 10 se 25 acre or 0
 88 percent people own more than 25 acres of land
 mukhyamantri ne is aadhaar par akalan kiya ki agar 5 acre se zyada kii jameen vaale kisaan kaa pradesh ke kul 71 lakh kisaanon main se yoga dekha jaae to yah sankhya 15 fisadi ke kareeb baithti he, jo svaichhik taur par yah madad chhodane main sakasham hai
 Although the government has said that this decision is not mandatory, it can be done only in a voluntary manner

 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has been vehemently opposing the Modi government since the beginning
 ab unhone centre sarkaar kii ab tak kii sabase badi swasthya yojana "ayushmaan bharat" kaa bhi virodh kiya he
 Mamta has announced that West Bengal will not be a part of this plan
 aisa karne vaala bengal desh kaa pehla rajya hoga
 This is not the first time Mamata Banerjee has opposed any decision of the Modi government
 isse pehle bhi kai bade muddon par unhone sarkaar ko gheraa he
 These include decisions like demonetisation, GST
 notebandi ke khilaaf andolan kii batnotbandi ke dauraan mamata banerjee ne deshbhar main vipakshi netaaon ke saath ghumkar modi sarkaar kaa virodh kiya tha
 Mamta had fiercely attacked the government by sharing the stage with Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav and Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 mamata banerjee ne notebandi ke faisle ko hi galat bataate hue sidhe-sidhe ise waapas lene kii maang kii thi
 On 20 November 2016, PM warned that the PM should withdraw this decision within three days or else she will agitate across the country
 lekin mamata ke andolan kii ye dhamkee phuss sabit hui kyonki pashchim bengal ke baahar hui unki reliyon main bheed nahin juty
 Apart from this, even after the completion of one year of demonetisation, Mamta had registered a protest by putting a black profile photo on Twitter
 jiesti kaa bhi dhur virodhammata banerjee ne jiesti kii aalochana karte hue ise 'great celfish tex' qaraar diya he
 The Chief Minister of West Bengal had said that the use of GST is going to harass people and destroy the country's economy
 aadhaar mudde par nahin maani thi batkendre sarkaar dwaara kai yojanaon ko aadhaar card se link karne kaa bhi mamata ne virodh kiya tha
 He said that as soon as you link mobile from Aadhaar, he (the Central Government) will know everything
 ghar main aap kya kha rahe hai
 What are the spouses talking about
 sab unhen pataa chal jayega'
 However, Mamta was reprimanded by the Supreme Court in this case
 court ne kaha tha ki koi rajya sarkaar kis tarah sansad ke banaae hue kanoon ke khilaaf ja sakati he
 Which decisions of Modi government have you opposed Mamata Banerjee 1
 modi care2
 Jan Dhan Yojana 3
 aadhaar card4
 GST 5
 notebandi6
 Foreign policy (bhutan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sikkim's fascination for China) Apart from this, Mamata Banerjee also targeted BJP on the politics being done in the name of 'cow'
 unka kahana tha ki gaay ke naam par gorakshak gobhakshak ban rahe hai, kya ab ve log faisla karenge ki hamen kya khaanaa he
 Let us tell you that not only during the Modi government but also during the Manmohan Singh government, Mamta opposed the Center
 manmohan sarkaar ke vakt lagaataar bad rahe petrol-deazal ke daamon kaa virodh karte vakt mamata sarkaar se alag ho gai thim
 By now you must have read about the 'jahangiri Ghant' being installed outside the Mughal Emperor Jahangir's palace for the complainants, but now the Bihar Police will do the same for the complainants who come to him

 Inspector General of Police Arvind Pandey believes that now the complainants will not have to wander around to plead
 police adhikari unki shikaayatein jald sun sakenge
 He has instructed all the police officers of the area to put 'complainant bells' outside his government residence
 fariyadi ghanti lagavane vaale adhikariyon main police nireekshak se lekar police mahanireekshak tak shaamil honge
 He informed that the phone numbers of the police officers posted at the Superintendent of Police residence will also be public
 gauratlab he ki darbhanga prakshetra main 10 jile shaamil hai
 These districts are Madhubani, Darbhanga, Saharsa, Samastipur, Purnia, Katihar, Kishanganj, Araria, Supaul and Madhepura
 pandeya jab mujffarpur ke police up-mahanireekshak (diaiji) the tab bhi apane karyaalay ke saamne aisi ghanti lagavai thi
 His move was highly appreciated
 pandeya ne kaha ki police adheekshak awasaiya karyaalay par police avar nireekshak (eesai) str ke do padaadhikari tainaat rahenge
 Those officers will be able to listen to any complaint of the complainant coming between evening and night and take appropriate action
 unhone bataaya ki adhikariyon ke awaas ke baahar lagi ghanti bajte hi awasaiya karyaalay main pratiniyukt adhikari fariyadi ke paas jaakar shikaayat sunegaa or samaadhaan kii disha main karrwai karegaa
 Jharkhand's Parliamentary Affairs Minister Rajendra Prasad Singh has said that BJP should accept Congress President Sonia Gandhi as the daughter-in-law of the country
 mantri ne sonia gandhi ko balidaan kii pratimurti qaraar diya

 aapako yah sweekaar karnaa hoga
 Against the opposition's cut motion on the supplementary budget demands in the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly today, the Congress leader said that he (sonia) renounced the chair twice and in this way she is a symbol of sacrifice

 In an editorial in the party mouthpiece 'saamana', Modi's wedding was merely a formality
 swami samarth ramdaas samaaj ko apana jivan samarpit karne ke liye shaadi kii rasmon ke bich hi nikal gaye the
 At the same time, Modi and his wife separated from each other and Modi went on to become a Sangh pracharak
 jasodaben ko jab koi shikaayat hi nahin he to congress kyon bol rahi he
 The editorial has ridiculed Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi for targeting Modi on personal matters and inducting Union Minister Shashi Tharoor into saying that if the Congress is equally worried about Jasodaben then he should be in mysterious circumstances Must also say something about the killed Sunanda Pushkar
 sampadakeey main kaha gaya he, bevakoof log apni galatiyon par aankh munde rahete hai or duusare kii kamiyaan nikaalane main garv mahasoos karte hai
 The editorial says that what has to do with the common man and the issue of inflation, corruption, from Modi's marriage
 saamana main kaha gaya he, hamaare pados main bharat virdohi gatividhi ruk jaaegi
 
 kya daud ibrahim ko desh waapas laayaa jayega
 Will farmers' suicide stop in Maharashtra? It has also been said that the development of Gujarat did not stop due to Modi's election affidavit not mentioning his wife's name
 pichley saptaah, doda main ek chunavi raily main rahul ne modi par apni vaivaahik sthiti chhipaane kaa aarope lagaaya or yah bhi aarope lagaaya tha ki gujarat police ne bhaajapa netaa ke ishaare par sarkari tantra kaa istemaal karte hue ek yuvati kii niztaa kaa ulanghan kar peechha kiya
 Scientists at the US space agency NASA now accept the reality of extraterrestrial life
 unke mutabik pargrahi jivan sirf sambhaavna nahin, balki sach he or maanav 2045 tak prithvi se dur duusare grahon par jivan ke bare main nirnaayak sanket juta lenge
 According to the news agency Effe, the truth of the alien's life will not remain a mystery to scientists for long, but the question remains how long
 nasa kii mukhya vaigyanik ellen stophan ne is saptaah antariksh main jeevanuon ke sthanon ke bare main yojit kiye gaye sammelan main kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki ek dashak ke bheetar hamaare paas prithvi se dur anya grahon par bhi jivan ke bare main thos pramaan honge
 We will gather concrete evidence about this over a period of 20 to 30 years
 'unhone kaha, 'ham jaanate hai ki kahaan or kaise khojbin kerani he
 In most of the cases we have technology and we are moving towards implementing it
 main sochataa hum ki yakeenan, ham sahi maarg par hai
 'however he cautioned,' We are not talking about the alien here
 ham chote-chote jeevanuon ke bare main baat kar rahe hai
 ' ek kitaab hoti to aapke liye bhi aasaan hota lekin jab koi lekhak rachate-rachate sansar main se sansar khadaa kar detaa he tab us lekhak ke pathak hone kaa kaam bhi mushkil ho jaataa he
 You cannot learn about a book by reading it
 jo lekhak likhte likhte samaaj main apane liye jagah banaata he, ant main usee ke liye samaaj main jagah nahin bachati he
 Even after this, it is written by him, which lasts till those who forget him
 'raag darbari' ke pachaas saal ho chuke hai, zaahir he lekhak ke chale jane ke baad kitaaben pathakon ko khojati rahati hai
 She continues her journey

 After knowing the names of all these books, if you think of reading, then i can say with confidence that you will not regret it

 You will be filled with freshness, your inner history will start flying, then you will want to meet the author too

 She has been active on the speaking and speaking front for 94 years
 92 saal kii umr main unki chaar kitaaben ai thim
 Whoever read and heard them, returned to understand that they have seen the era of a writer
 25 janvari kii subah krishna sobati kaa nidhan ho gaya
 The bulk of what he had is left behind by creating trust for the upcoming writers
 apni bachat, apana makaan sab aap pathakon or lekhakon ke liye
 Eleven lakh and one crore savings of Jnanpith Award and has given Apna Houses to the Trust
 isse lekhakon ke liye ek ghar banegaa jiskaa naam hoga zindginama
 His creations continued to create uproar but his farewell went silent today
 unhen afsos bhi nahin hoga
 One line of his interview is' My acquaintances are more, friends are less
 ' ashok vaajapeyi ne kaha he ki somvaar ko chaar baje dilli ke triveni sabhaagaar main smriti sabha hogi
 There are many girls in Krishna Sobti's creation world
 azaad bharat ke pehle ke bharat main paidaa hui thim
 Hockey used to play
 skating karne kaa man karata tha
 At the age of 93, when she received the Jnanpith Award, she could not take it to the President
 jinhone krishna sobati ko dekha he unki nafaasat ko bhi dekha hoga
 Krishna Sobti was a well-known writer in black and white photographs as well as in color photographs
 anamika se baatcheet main kaha he ki talkatoraa garden main haaki khelti thim
 Loved fancy heels, writing with Shaffer's pen
 jivan bhar garaara pahana
 Where do you see someone in Garra in this Delhi? baad ke dinon main ve apane liye lanbaa kurta dizine kar pahanane lageen
 Krishna Sobti has said that my critics say that i celebrate life in my writing
 meraa yakeen dar or niraashaa main nahin he balki jivan ko jaisaa man kahe, vaise jeene main he
 So i told him about his clothes and sports that the writer also has to live
 jhakki swabhaav kii bhi thim, unhen manaa lenaa kisi ke liye aasaan nahin tha
 It was not easy to stop them
 niranjan dev sharma ne unase bachapan ke bare main poocha to kaha ki main 2025 main paidaa hoti or is sadi kii global duniya ko ji bhar-bharkar jiti
 Handing over his business to an advertising agency, he used to get rid of others
 isaki ninda, uski badakhoi, ise khaded, use udhed
 It is obvious that she does not do this, but on the same excuse, she also showed the mirror to the world
 pakistan ke gujarat main paidaa hui thim
 Therefore, there is also the pain of missing everything in his compositions
 magar vah taras khaane vaala dard nahin, itihaas ko itihaas kii tarah chhod jane kaa dard tha
 You are seeing a writer from these pictures who used to laugh and laugh amidst all the storms
 dilli main edlt ajukeshan vibhaag main kaam kiya tha
 Our village and our city were editors of two magazines

 Om came on Thanvi's insistence and read his paper and later got it printed
 chhapavaya hi nahin, bantwaya bhi
 By the name of author, power, culture and civics
 pratirodh kaa parchaa shuru hota he bharat ke samvidhan kii uddeshika se
 We narrate the speech of that time so that you can stop and think if a writer comes to protest at the age of 92, then for whom
 zaahir he us naagarik samaaj ke saath khadey hone ke liye jise nafrat kii aandhi uda le janaa chaahati ho
 Whosoever is playing this politics, caste, class, religion, sect is against human and human
 uske virodh main he
 He is devoid of democracy

 Such powers which are against democracy and want to re-establish the old shabby system
 dharmik or jaateey dwandv or hinsa ke sab pahalu unki tijori main band hai
 The safes never answer
 vah prajaaon ke aage sirf hathiyaar phenkati hai
 Take - hold and fight so that we stay frozen
 krishna sobati ko lakhon logon ne padhaa, suna
 The list of awards he received is as long as the books
 lekhak kaa janatantr kitaab main giradhar rathi ke ek sawaal ke jawaab main kahati hai, 'yaad rahe, itihaas ko dubaara likh-likhakar, uske shabdon main pher-badal kar aap jaateey yaa rashtriya durbalataaon ko uplabdhiyaan banaakar gaurav-gaan karnaa chahen to aapako koun roak saktaa he? yaad itnaa rahe ki itihaas kaa punarlekhan ek aisi raajnneeti he jo dilon main ghrinaa, vikshobh or vaimnasy ke ambaar jutati he or mauqaa dekhte hi aag sulgaakar laplpaane lagati he

 sardiyon main hari subjiyan khaane kaa jaayaka badha detii hai
 But this year Manjar is somewhat different
 subjiyan hari to hai, lekin unki keemten laal pili hoti ja rahi hai
 a few months ago, there was a huge increase in the price of vegetables
 tab jaankaron ne iske peeche bemausam hue barish ko jimmedaar bataaya tha, par vartmaan mahangaai ke liye barish ko jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Prices increased by 30% This year, the prices of vegetables have increased by more than 30% as compared to the previous year
 masalan, pichley saal pyaaj kii keemten 35 se 40 thim, jo vartmaan main 65 se 70 rupee hai
 Potatoes have increased from Rs 12-15 to Rs 25 to Rs 30
 vahiin tamaato kii keemten 20-30 se badhkar 55-65 rupee ho gai hai
 According to a customer shopping for vegetables made of vegetables, today, buying green vegetables and eating is equivalent to luxury
 kyonki jis hisaab se subjiyon kii keemton main vruddhi ho rahi he, usase yah spasht he ki koi saamaanya aay vaala vyakti har din khaane main hari subjiyon ko shaamil karne kaa kharch nahin uthaa saktaa
 Vegetables were not so expensive in spite of demonetisation, people say that vegetables were cheap despite demonetisation last year
 lekin is saal subjiyon kii keemten 30 pratishat se zyada badi hai
 Prices of many vegetables have reached 100 rupees per kilogram
 daam badhane kii ye he vajahasabji waalon kaa kahana he ki jahaan se sabji aati hai, vahiin se supplai kaaphi kam ho chuki he
 One reason is that the crop has reduced this year compared to every year
 khaastaur se gobhi or methi kii fasal kam hui he
 To avoid losses, farmers reduced yields and grew mostly cotton in the fields
 kuch kisaanon ne apane upar laden karj ke chalate apni jaminen bech di
 In such a situation, when the land was reduced, it also affected the yield
 maang zyada ho or purti kam to keemton kaa badhanaa to laazmi he

 Former Army Chief and Minister of State for External Affairs General VK Singh has made a big disclosure about Balakot Airstrike
 mangalvaar ko wike singh ne kaha ki airstrike sirf ek jagah hui thi
 He said that the target was carefully selected by the Indian Air Force, so that the residential area or any common citizen would not fall prey to it
 250 aatankiyon ke maare jane ko lekar bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke bayaan par pratikriya dete hue wike singh ne kaha ki yah aankada is par aadhaarit tha, jo building main rah rahe the
 This is an estimate
 vah (amit shah) isaki pushti nahin kar rahe hai
 He (amit Shah) had said that many terrorists were killed
 mos MEA VK Singh on Amit Shah's "more than 250 terrorists were killed" in airstrike: That was based on people who were housed in the buildings which were hit, it's an estimate
 He is not saying this is a confirmed figure, he is saying this many might have died

 digvijay singh ne poocha tha savaalcongress netaa digvijay singh mangalvaar ko piem narendra modi se kai sawaal poocha
 He said that Prime Minister some ministers of your government say 300 terrorists were killed
 bhaajapa adhyaksh kehete hai 250 maare hai, yogi adityanath kehete hai 400 maare gayi or aapke mantri SS Ahluwalia kehete ek bhi nahin mara
 And you are silent about this

 sansad main bajet satr ke pehle din raashtrapati ramnath kovind ne apane abhibhaashan ke aakhri hisse main desh main ek saath chunaav karaae jane ke mudde par gambhir bahes karne kii badi bhaavnaatmak guhaar lagaai
 The ruling BJP is serious about the idea of holding elections to the state assemblies along with the Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki vipaksh kii aapattiyon ke alaava is vichaar ko lekar gahari rajnatik or aarthik chintaa jataai ja chuki he
 So far, four elections have been held simultaneously in the country's electoral history: first in 1952 after independence and then in the next three elections till 1967
 darasal, congress main 1969 main aitihaasik vighatan ke kaaran loksabhaa samay se pehle bhang ho gai thi or isse hi ek saath chunaav kii vyavastha tut gai thi
 Another thing played a role in this and that was the open use of Article 356 of the Constitution by the Congress to sack state governments and dissolve legislatures even before the term ends
 in paristhitiyon ke chalate aage chalakar ek saath chunaav karana sambhav nahin rahaa
 The BJP is intent on reviving the proposal, which it had put in political circles about a decade ago
 uskaa kahana he ki iske dirghakaalik aarthik or anya hit hai
 It also intends to complete Mission 360 in the 2019 election, in the hope that it will get more seats for itself and its allies
 modi saaf kar chuke hai ki ve ek saath chunaav ke iraade ke pakshdhar hai
 Within seven months of the commencement of his term, in January 2015, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Relations, Law and Justice had simultaneously argued the feasibility of the election
 saal khatm hote-hote usne chunaav ayog ke vichaaron ke saath ek report pesh kar di thi
 What happened between this reveals pm's interest
 yah kaam sthaayee samiti ke supurd kiya gaya
 Shortly thereafter, the then Chief Election Commissioner Hari Shankar Brahma had recorded that Modi's Principal Secretary Nripendra Mishra had informed him that there was a strong belief in favor of holding all the elections simultaneously
 (36 rajyon or centre shasit pradeshon main) baar-baar vidhansabha chunaav se saamaajik-aarthik vyavdhaan utpann hote hai
 Implementation of government schemes is also hampered
 saal 2016 kii shuruyaat main vidhi mantralay ne sansadeey samiti kii report par chunaav ayog se raay maangi thi
 Then in a meeting with BJP leaders on March 19, Modi had put his election intentions very strongly
 saamaanya prakriya main rajg ko yah ladaai jeetne ke liye samvidhan main sanshodhan karaane ke liye do-tihaai rajyon kaa samarthan jutanaa hoga, jinamein se ve rajya bhi hai jahaan uske rajnatik virdohi satta main hai
 Only then will she be able to achieve this objective, which most critics, including all constitutional experts, are dismissing as nonsense
 kanoon mantri ravi shankar prasad kehete hai, ''loksabhaa or rajya vidhansabhaon ko apaat sthiti main ek saal ke vistaar ko chhod den to paanch saal se ek din bhi zyada kaa kaarykaal na dene vaale chunavi vyavastha se jude anuchhed 172 main kisi bhi tarah ke sthaayee badlaav ke liye samvidhan ko gaharaai se padhakar uskaa sanshodhan karnaa hoga
 With this change, it must also be ensured that without a positive vote of confidence, you cannot bring a motion of no confidence
 lekin iske liye rajnatik sahmati kii khaasi darkaar hogi
 "according to Prasad, an amendment to the Constitution would also have to be adopted that a motion of no-confidence can be brought only once within a five-year term of a House
 logon kii chintaaen is ehsaas se bad gai hai ki agar bhaajapa chaahe to sarkaar ke paas ek or aasaan tarika he
 It can follow the system of "one nation, one election" in 11 out of 17 major states without amending the constitution
 iske liye bhaajapa ko sirf itnaa karnaa hoga ki disambar 2018 main hi aam chunaav kara die jaaen jab teen bade rajyon—chhattisgarh, madhya pradesh or rajasthan main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Along with this, she can also ask some other BJP ruled states including Maharashtra and Haryana to hold elections ahead of time
 yah hua to chunaav ayog swatah apane visheshadhikaar kaa istemaal karke andhra pradesh, telugana or odisha main bhi pehle chunaav karaane kii ghoshnaa kar saktaa he, jahaan 2014 main loksabhaa chunaavon ke saath hi vidhansabhaon ke vot pade the
 The general perception within the party is that all the work stops for 45 days due to the election code of conduct at regular intervals
 agar loksabhaa chunaav or rajyon kii vidhansabhaon ke chunaavon ke dauraan har rajya main 45-45 dinon ke do antaraal kaa vyavdhaan aata he to har paanch saal ke dauraan teen maah tak desh kaa kaamkaaj thap ho jaataa he
 So why not change it to a 45-day gap just once
 haalanki, bhaajapa ke bhi kuch varisht netaaon kaa suzav he ki loksabhaa or vidhansabhaon ke chunaavon ko samanvit karne kii prakriya ko ekamusth karne kii bajaae do charnon main kiya jaae to behatar he, bhale hi samvidhan main sanshodhan or aam sahmati sunishchit hi kyon na ho jaae
 Kailash Vijayvargiya, the party's general secretary, says, "it would be impossible to arrange enough police and paramilitary forces necessary to hold elections together
 "party ke bheetar kai netaaon kaa maananaa he ki chunaavon ko milaane kii prakriya ko charanbaddh karaane se bhaajapa kaa hi phayda hoga
 Karnataka will be the first major state where elections are to be held in April
 bhaajapa ko loksabhaa chunaav main yahaan acchhee badhat mili thi or usne 28 main se 17 siten jeetin thim
 Now it is looking to remove the Siddaramaiah government of the state from power
 disambar main chhattisgarh, madhya pradesh or rajasthan main vidhansabha chunaav hai, jo bhaajapa ke garh to hai, lekin vahaan satta virdohi lahar ke haaavee hone kii ashanka he
 The last time bjp's 63 mps came from these states
 yani loksabhaa main uski kul takat kaa lagbhag 25 fisadi
 In this emerging perspective, BJP is emphasizing on simultaneous election system and wants to implement it by the end of this year
 ummid lagaai ja rahi he ki us samay sara prachaar narendra modi ke irdagird rah jayega or rajyon ke apane chunavi mudde gaun ho jaaenge
 This will give BJP an edge
 bhaajapa ke ranneetikaron kaa maananaa he ki ek saath chunaav se party ko chhattisgarh, madhya pradesh or rajasthan main satta virdohi lahar ke boj se paar paane main bhi madad milegi
 If good results are found elsewhere, then the defeat in these states will not be as important as it will be in the midst of a big victory
 vishleshkon ke mutabik, agar ye vidhansabha chunaav loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle hote hai to bhaajapa ke liye aam chunaav main mushkil khadi ho sakati he
 If assembly elections are held without the Lok Sabha in December in these three states, a situation like Gujarat could arise and the BJP will have to go through a tough challenge against its will
 gujarat to pradhanmantri kaa grih rajya tha, lekin in rajyon main sthaneey gaurav jaisaa koi mudda bhunaane ko nahin bachegaa
 Apart from this, the roles and personalities of the current Chief Ministers — Raman Singh, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Vasundhara Raje Scindia and other local issues — will not be useful to beat Modi's magic or drumming of central government policies
 bhaajapa ke liye ek yaa kai rajyon main haar kaa vikalp hi nahin he
 It will directly compete with the Congress in these three states and the bjp's defeat will not only boost the moral morale of the Congress, it will also help in getting support from other opposition parties, especially in Uttar Pradesh, which has 80 Lok Sabha seats
 , 73 of which were won by the BJP and its allies in the last election
 isse hi rashtriya chunaav ke vijeta kaa faisla ho jayega
 There is always some benefit if a state has its own government at the time of elections
 isliye chunaavon ko milaanaa or baaki rajyon ko aisa karne ke liye lapete main le lenaa bhaajapa-endie ke liye chautarafa jeet kii ranneeti ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 Clearly, simultaneous elections will make it easier for Modi to restrict himself to campaigning in the BJP ruled states and he will hide the failures of the state governments and lead to a debate as to who should be the next Prime Minister
 vishleshkon kii raay main modi apni behatar bhaashanbaaji kaa istemaal karke khud ko peedit ke rup main dikhaa sakate hai or is dharna ko is mukaam tak lekar ja sakate hai ki bharat ko keval ve hi bachaa sakate hai
 An advantage of holding elections simultaneously is that there is less possibility of voters voting for a separate party for their state and for a government at the center
 yahi kaaran he ki anya bhaajapa shasit rajyon ko bhi chunaav karaane ko taiyaar karke or phir un saare rajyon ko shaamil karke jinamein agle chah maheene main chunaav hone hai, bhaajapa-rajg ko khaasaa laabh mil jayega
 It is feared that the last time the BJP had announced to hold Lok Sabha elections during the tenure of the Vajpayee government, it was defeated
 isliye congress or anya bade vipakshi dalon ke paas is vichaar kaa virodh karne kii behatar vajah he
 It would not be an ideal situation for the Congress to hold all the elections together, as it is currently outside its limits to raise the necessary financial resources
 congress ko isamen kharaab niyat bhi najar aati he

 For this, where is the consensus on seven out of the 10 necessary changes to the constitution? Will there be fixed tenures for the legislatures and the Lok Sabha? No opinion was taken from all stakeholders
 "purv loksabhaa spikar somnath chatarji kehete hai, ''agar vidhansabha-loksabhaa chunaav saath hote hai to rajyon ke or rashtriya mudde aapas main takaraayenge or rajya ke liye mahatvapurn vishay nazarandaaj ho jaaenge yaa phir iskaa ulataa bhi ho saktaa he
 The structure of the constitution does not provide its scope

 "it is also feared that regional parties will be marginalized by this arrangement

 According to Sanjay Kumar, "if the elections are different then there will be a possibility of regional parties winning it
 ek saath chunaav unke daayre ko simit karenge kyonki ve sthaneey aakankshaon or muddon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 This will reverse the process of going deep into democracy
 " pro
 Kumar suggests that instead of trying to hold elections simultaneously by making laws, there should be an attempt to hold simultaneous elections in the same states where the tenures of the assemblies are nearing completion
 siesds ne 1989 se 2014 ke bich jahaan-jahaan loksabhaa chunaav ke saath vidhansabhaon main bhi vot pade, aise 31 rajyon main chunaavon kaa adhyayan kiya he
 In 24 of these cases, the proportion of major political parties was the same in both the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections
 mahaj saat maamalon main hi votaron kaa alag mood dekhne ko mila
 Similarly, in another study about the behavior of voters in a total of 2,600 assembly constituencies in the elections, it was found that in 77 percent of the cases, the party that won the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections from that assembly constituency was the same
 jabaki alag-alag hone vaale chunaavon main mahaj 61 fisadi maamalon main hi vah party vidhansabha chunaav bhi jiti jiskaa us ilaake main maujuuda saansad tha
 Former Independent MP and political analyst from Left-backed Kerala Dr
 sebstian paul ke mutabik, yah kadam betuka or loktantr kii vichaardhaara ke vipareet hoga
 He cites the anomalies that firstly, no one can guarantee the tenure of the Lok Sabha or any state assembly or government in a situation where no single party gets a simple majority to govern
 agar kisi rajya main sarkaar gir jaati he or centre main sarkaar satta main bani rahati he to rajya main shashan kaa bhavishya kya hoga? tab to centre sarkaar rajya main raashtrapati shashan laga degi or agle aam chunaav tak vidhansabha chunaav taal degi
 Paul says, "the idea behind an election is to bring a government with a presidential-centric government in India, with a hidden agenda to destabilize federalism and state autonomy
" yah hamaare loktantr ko ventilator par laane or hamaare samvidhan kii mul bhaavana—anekta main ekta ko hi chhin-bhinn karne kii koshish he
 "others argue that this idea of holding elections simultaneously with the help of new rules will serve as a safeguard against situations like no-confidence motions and the fall of the central government in the middle of the term
 isse rashtriya patal par zyada sthir shashan sunishchit hoga or nai rajnatik samskruti ke panpane kii sambhaavna rahegi
 Since the veteran BJP leaders are already claiming that this will be the biggest electoral reform ever, Modi is expected to push it forward with his slogan that "convert the largest democracy into the greatest democracy" Be done
 "chunaav sudhaaron kii vakaalat karne vaale tamaam log ek saath chunaav ko galat bataate hai
 According to him, the need is to rectify the discrepancies in the system of giving victory to the frontrunner in the race where the political minority-parties or individuals win the election by getting only 25 to 30 percent of the vote

 Jayaprakash Narayan says that "simultaneous elections are theoretically correct because continuous elections disrupt the functioning of governance and promote competitive popular promises-gifts between the parties
" "agar disambar main vidhansabhaon ke chunaavon ke saath loksabhaa chunaav karaae jate hai to congress or anya vipakshi dalon ke liye chunaav prachaar or votaron ko lubhaane ke liye sansaadhan jutanaa asambhav-sa hoga
 By turning the debate around Modi, the BJP and its allies can already turn the atmosphere in their favor to a large extent

 lashkar-e-taiba chief Hafiz Saeed is suddenly in the news again
 10 milian america dollar inami hafiz said or uske lashkar par lagi pabandi pichley hafte hi pakistan ne hataai he
 And now the shocking news is coming that with the help of Pakistani army and Pakistani intelligence agency ISI, Hafiz has completed the complete blue print of the coup in Pakistan within two years
 itnaa hi nahin hafiz ne apane plan 20-20 ke tahat jo plan banaaya he wo agar kahin kaamyaab ho gaya to pakistan puri duniya ke liye khatra ban jayega
 Will there be a coup in Pakistan again? Is the boss of terror going to become PM? Pakistan's PM in 2020 Hafeez Saeedbanega? All these questions are arising after a report
 us report main oxford uniwarsity kii taraf se ye sansanikhez khulaasa kiya gaya he
 It is only three months old
 pakistan ke aam chunaav main hafiz said or aatank ke uske lashkar kaa khaataa tak nahin khulaa tha
 Was confiscated till surety
 ek tarah se pakistani avam ne hi hafiz or ushke lashkar ko puri tarah se nakaar diya tha
 But despite this embarrassing and embarrassing defeat, Hafiz Saeed has created such a blue print
 jisaki badaulat wo sirf do saal main hi pakistan ke pradhanmantri pad ko hathiyaane ja rahaa he
 The shocking thing is that this conspiracy is not disclosed by anyone but a report from Oxford University
 sirf hafte bhar pehle hi imran khan ne hafiz or hafiz ke lashkar par lage bain ko hataaya tha
 Hafiz Saeed also informed Pakistan court about this
 ab vahi hafiz said karaari chunavi haar ke baavjood twanti twanti kii saazish main jute gaya he
 Before i fully disclose this plan 20-20 of Hafiz Saeed, let me tell you that the Oxford University of England has revealed this shocking
 usee oxford uniwarsity kii ek report main kaha gaya he ki is vakt syria se bhi zyaada aatankwaadi pakistan kii zameen par fal phool rahe hai
 Not only this, because of the presence of these terrorists, Pakistan is 3 times more dangerous for humanity than Syria
 oxford uniwarsity kii is report ke mutabik do saal baad hafiz said pakistan kii satta par kabza kar legaa
 And in this, not only the Pakistani Army or its terrorist organizations, but other countries of the world will also become the ladder to reach the pm's chair
 tasawwur kiijie ekainami aatankical agar pakistan kaa pradhanmantri banegaa to kya hoga
 Of course, this fantasy is also going to make India uncomfortable
 kyonki bharat jise mulk main aatanki hamale kaa jimmedaar maanata he
 And whose organization is gaining worldwide support for declaring it as a terrorist organization
 jab vahi pradhanmantri ban jayega
 So what will happen to India's foreign policy
 magar sawaal ye he ki aakhir hafiz kaa 20-20 plan kya he
 Because in the recent general election he did not get a single seat
 uske tamaam aatanki gurgon kii zamaanat zabt ho gai
 Even his party was not allowed to contest elections by the Election Commission
 to phir mahaz do saalon main aisa kya hone vaala he ki aatank kaa mantri pakistan kaa pradhanmantri ban jayega

 The Congress has decided to initiate a strong public opinion campaign in favor of the legal provisions that give special powers to Assam and many other states in the Northeast and to surround the BJP
 is jansapanrk ke madhyam se vah purvottar kii janata ko is bare main aagaah karegi ki centre kii sattarudh party bhaajapa jammu-kashmir se 370 ke mukhya pravaadhan hataane jaisaa koi kadam purvottar ke 'sanvaidhanik raksha kavach' anuchhed 371 ke sandarbh main bhi uthaa sakati he
 The main opposition party says that after the statement of Amit Shah, there has been concern and fear among the people of the Northeast about why the Home Minister has to give this clarification? In a high-level meeting on the Northeast under the leadership of Congress President Sonia Gandhi here on Friday, it was decided that in the backdrop of the Modi government's move on Article 370, it directly approached the public on the subject of the Articles giving special rights to the Northeast States
 Go and prepare a public opinion on it
 baithak main purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh, congress ke varisht netaa ahamed patel, eke antni or kasee venugopal, purvottar ke rajyon ke pradesh adhyaksh or vidhayak dal ke netaa maujuud the

 ' unhone kaha, '370 or 371 main zyada fark nahin he
 The people of Jammu and Kashmir had special rights under 370
 usee tarah assam or purvottar ke anya rajyon ko 371e, 371bi, 371si tathaa kuch anya anuchhedon ke tahat vishesh suraksha mili hui he
 It is the constitutional defense shield for the Northeast
 kisi bhi haalat main ise hataaya nahin janaa chahie
 Bora said, 'why did Amit Shah need to give a statement? Certain people were demanding to remove 370, but not a single person from any corner of the country demanded the removal of 371
 shah ke taaja bayaan se purvottar ke logon ko chintaa ho gayi he
 There is a fear among people that 371 should not be removed
 ' unhone kaha, 'ham janata ke bich is mudde ko le jane , unhen is par jaagruk karne kaa kaam shuru kar rahe hai
 Public relations is starting immediately in Assam and will start soon in other states
 ' darasal, pichley dinon kendriya grih mantri amit shah ne purvottar ke rajyon kii chintaaon ko dur karte hue kaha tha ki kshetra se jude vishesh kanoon ko nahin chuaa jayega
 Significantly, under the Articles 371, 371A, 371B, 371C, 371D, 371E, 371F, 371G, 371H, 371I and 371J, the North Eastern states and some other territories of the country got certain special rights

 Famous as a working officer during his stay at SP in Jamshedpur from 1994 to 1996, Dr
 ajay kumaar ne dedh dashak baad yaheen se apni rajnatik pari kii shuruyaat kii he
 Ajay Kumar contested the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JHVIMO) by-election with a margin of 1,55,000 votes in the by-election held here after Arjun Munda, the head of the state coalition government and bjp's Arjun Munda vacated the Jamshedpur Lok Sabha seat
 Has won unke khilaaf khadey hone vaale kai diggaj to apni jamaanat tak nahin bachaa sake
 Not only did the BJP lose this coveted seat, the bail of its candidate and party president Dineshanand Goswami was also forfeited
 haalanki vipaksh ise rajya sarkaar ke khilaaf janadesh bataa rahaa he, lekin sattarudh rajg kii haar kaa kaaran jhamumo or ageesu kaa alag-alag chunaav ladanaa mana ja rahaa he
 There is a lesson in this defeat as well
 ek-duusare ke khilaaf chunaav maidan main utre sattarudh gathbandhan ke teenon sadasyon-bhaajapa, jhamumo or ageesu-ke vot dekhen jaaen to inhen vijeta se adhik vot mili hai
 Munda also believes the same, "people expected that allies of the coalition parties of the government should fight together because we are not a pre-election alliance, so we did not insist on it
" agar aap gathbandhan ko hasil mat pratishat dekhen to ham unase kahin adhik hai
 It is not a mandate against the government
 '' kuch aisa hi hashr gathbandhan sarkaar main shaamil jharkhand mukti morcha (jhamumo) ke ummidavaar sudhir mahato kaa bhi hua
 If any party is looking at the prospects of a golden future even in defeat, it is the AJSU in the government
 jiske ummidavaar aastik mahato ko anumaan se adhik 99,058 mat hasil hue hai
 At a time when no one had imagined Ajay Kumar's victory with such a huge margin, it is clear from the result of the Jamshedpur by-election that Jhavimo and its president Babulal Marandi emerge as a major power of Jharkhand in the coming days
 Can
 bhaajapa jamshedpur loksabhaa ke tahat aane vaale chah ke chah vidhansabha kshetron main pichad chuki he
 Urban assembly constituencies that once used to be BJP strongholds have been occupied by Marandi overnight
 bhaajapa ne ain chunaav ke din ajay kumaar kaa kathith naksali netaa samarji se chunavi madad maangane par hui baatcheet kaa ek vivaadaaspad tepe bhi jari kiya tha
 But it also could not have any effect
 adivasee vot kaa ekmaatr pairokaar maani jane vaali jhamumo kii jameen ko babulal ne aisa khoda ki sudhir mahato aundhe munh tisare paaydaan par ludhak gaye
 However, the BJP can also reassure itself that Ajay Kumar's figure of 2,76,582 is less than the total votes of Arjun Munda, 3,19,616 in the 2009 general election
 bhaajapa ne yah bhi tark diya he ki munda ke istife kii jhavimo kii lagaataar maang ke koi myne nahin hai kyonki yah pehla mauka nahin he jab mukhyamantri dwaara chodi gai seat par hue up-chunaav main bhaajapa ummidavaar kii haar hui ho
 The party was defeated by JMM chief Shibu Soren in the by-election for Dumka Lok Sabha seat in 2002
 yah seat marandi ke mukhyamantri banane par khaali hui thi
 Marandi did not resign at the time when the BJP lost the by-election
 aise main unka istipha maangana bhi koi myne nahin rakhata
 The Congress may be happy at the moment for the defeat of its arch-bjp, but with the growing support base of its ally JHVM, the leaders of the State Congress must have understood that Marandi is not backward in coming to a compromise on its terms Will remove pehle se hi aantarik kalah se jujh rahi congress ko jamshedpur main aisi patkhni mili ki uski ummidavaar banna gupta kii gaadi mahaj 49,137 maton par aakar hi ruk gai
 It can be said that there is some message for each party of Jharkhand in this victory of Jhavimo
 yah bhi saaf he ki isane jhavimo ke haunsalon ko or buland hi kiya he
 The Supreme Court has refused to change the Juvenile Justice Act

 Should the accused minor be sentenced to death? Click here to give your opinion

 In fact, in December last year, a girl accused of gang-raping a girl in a moving bus in Delhi called herself a minor
 iske baad hi puure desh main juvenil justise act kii samiksha kii maang uthi thi
 Aaj Tak salute girl victim of Delhi gangrape is gangrape maamle main pehla faisla 25 july ko hone vaala he
 Due to this accused being a minor, the maximum punishment can be only 3 years
 naaballig hi sabase bada haivaan!gauratlab he ki dilli gangrape cese ke baad puraa desh ubal uthaa tha
 In this case, the minor is considered to be the biggest hero

 naaballig aaropee par peedit se do baar rape karne kaa aarope he
 It is alleged that this minor raped the girl for the second time in an unconscious state
 lekin is aaropee ko uske gunahon ke hisaab se sajaa nahin mil paaegi, kyonki uski umr aade aa gai he
 The juvenile board has also considered the most abusive act to be minor
 ghatana ke vakt uski umr 17 saal, 6 maheene, 12 din thi
 This compulsion of law will give the minor accused an extension
 jo bhi sajaa hogi, vah use jail kii bajaay bal sudhaar grih main kaatani hogi
 The government also took a tough stance on the gang rape of 'rarest of the rare'

 yah ran out cricket itihaas ke sabase bevakoofana ran out main se ek mana ja rahaa he
 Actually, Pakistani batsman Azhar Ali was run out in a very bizarre manner in the 53rd over of Pakistan's second innings

 Unbelievable
 😳azhar Ali run out whilst chatting with Shafiq in the middle, thinking he's hit a four

 com / nhfgroq2aw— Abu Eesa Niamatullah (@niamatullah) October 18, 2018 It happened that Azhar Ali played in the off side off Australian pace bowler Peter Siddle and ran for a run
 gend sidhe boundry ke paas chali gai
 On the pitch, both batsmen Asad Shafiq and Azhar Ali started talking thinking that the ball has gone beyond the boundary line
 yahi par donon ballebaajon se galati ho gai or boundry line ke paas michel stark ne gend ko pakadakar wicketiper team pen ko phenk di
 Team Penn made no mistake and caught the throw and applied it to the stumps
 jisase ajahar ali ran out ho gaye
 This method of Azhar Ali being run out was quite childish
 ajahar ali gend ko dekhe bina chaukaa samajhakar non strike par khadey shafiq ke saath baatcheet karne ke liye pich ke bich main aakar ruuk gaye, donon ballebaaj baton main mashgool the, vahiin gend third main kii ore boundry se kuch gaj pehle hi ruuk gai
 Stark, taking advantage of his mistake, threw the ball towards Tim Paine and Paine dropped the gills without delay
 is dekhakar ajahar ali kaaphi hairaan bhi hue or unhen kuch samaj nahin aayaa ki hakeekat main hua kya he
 Azhar returned to the pavilion after scoring 64 runs

 India had a very strong relationship with the Afghan government in the 1990s when peace was being practiced in Afghanistan and the Taliban government was involved
 afghanistan main 2001 main taliban sarkaar girane ke baad pakistan ne afgaan taliban kaa sahaara lete afghanistan main bharat ke prabhaav ko kam karne kii lagaataar koshish kii he
 Despite this, India has consistently helped Afghanistan in the direction of development and peace in Afghanistan

 Also read: These five achievements of India are frightening China
 This episode made it clear to America that now it needs to look away from Pakistan for the elimination of terrorism
 lihaaja, yadi america videsh mantri ek baar phir afghanistan main taliban ko sarkaar main shaamil kar shanti kaa prayaas karnaa chaahate hai to use sunishchit karnaa hoga ki pakistan sarkaar afgaan ladaakon kii madad se is shaati kii koshish ko vifal karne main safal na ho
 It is due to this effort that the US Secretary of State in his meeting can favor India to play an important role in the afpak policy

 Many legendary sage saints took part in the program till date
 santon ne madhya pradesh kii shivaraj sarkaar se naaraazgi jataane ke saath-saath muslim tushtikaran kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 Computer Baba said, 'it has been 15 years for the Shivraj government in Madhya Pradesh
 ye keval baabaaon kaa mukhauta laga lete hai or kehete hai ki bhagava kii sarkaar he, hinduon kii sarkaar he
 They have made all the saints such that they are with BJP whereas all saints are with religion
 sabhi sant pareshaan hai
 At least 100 slums have broken into Chitrakoot
 maine shivaraj singh se kaha ki ye jo jhuggi tod rahe hai, to ek patta hi de do
 'computer Baba said,' The saints were not so much disturbed in Babar's time, we were not disturbed even during the Congress era but got upset in the BJP era
 hamako ronaa aata he
 They form the government in our name, they eat in our name but drive us out
 ham bilkul pareshaan hai, ham dukhit hai

 Wherever natural places were found earlier, saints were left
 aaj se 50 saal pehle se lekar sadhu sant ise apana desh maanate rahe hai, lekin ab to hamen yahaan kaa naagarik bhi nahin mana jaataa he
 If a poor hut is demolished, then it is compensated, but the Math temples are desolated overnight and no compensation is given
 'avadheshanand ne kaha ki santon ke liye sarkaar kuch nahin sochati
 The aim of coming into politics is that we should keep our word firmly

 We are Indians and more Indians than anyone, but if our identity is erased then existence will disappear
 ham musalamaanon se nafrat nahin karte hai
 We do not want the artist of Assam, Adil Hussain, to appear in NRC and be thrown out
 ham us tarah se hindu nahin hai jis tarah se aap hindu dharm ko samajhate hai
 The enraged Brahmaputra brings devastation but is part of identity and family
 ham asamiya hai
 We have also adopted people from Bangladesh
 magar hamaari udaartaa ko nahin samajha gaya
 We cannot lose our Assamese identity
 main ek baat kaa prastaav karnaa chahta hum
 If Hindu Bangladeshi migrants living in Assam threaten their identity, then they should be settled in UP and Bihar
 do minute main jhagada khatm ho jayega
 Bihar cannot get old Bengal, but some good Bengalis will get it
 bihar or upi kii udaartaa ise kushi kushi sweekaar bhi kar legi
 The Home Minister should speak to the Chief Ministers of Bihar and UP and declare it
 chunki ye log lambey samay tak visthapit rahe hai isliye inhen kamjor aarthik tabake ke aarakshan main bhi joda ja saktaa he
 This will not disturb Assam's identity crisis
 in do pradeshon ne jis tarah se naagarikta kaanoon or register kaa samarthan kiya he mujhe lagata he ve apane yahaan bangladeshi hinduon kaa bhi khulkar swaagat karenge

 sarkaar chaahati to puraane niyamon ke tahat hi naagarikta de sakati thi
 Is also given amit shah ne ek baar bhi assam main hue naagarikta register kaa zikr nahin kiya
 While everyone knows that most of the 19 lakh people who have been left out of the register are Hindus
 tabhi assam main bijepi ne assam ke neshnal register kaa virodh kiya
 Counting again was demanded
 ab amit shah puure desh main register lagu karenge
 Common people, whether they are Hindus or Muslims, will start searching for documents and will go through torture
 unhone naagarikta kaanoon se ek dharm ko alag kar or kai dharmon ko jod kar khel khelaa he
 If they are not taking the rights of anyone, then tell why then they are adding religion to give rights to someone
 taslima nasrin ne bangladesh main hinduon ke utpeedan par lajja likhaa tha

 Amit Shah says that will apply under the general rules
 wo khud kah rahe hai ki musalamaanon ko naagarikta ke liye alag kaanoon he
 What about the persecution of Hindu and other five religions? 12
 Will they not be harassed after 2014? Then why put this date only? Whoever comes after this will have to go through the torture of waiting for some law? Amit Shah did not make any clear talk about the number in the house
 rajyasabha main bill par matdaan ke pehle kaha ki unke paas aankade nahin hai
 As the citizenship will be given, the number will be known
 yani ve bhi un 14 lakh bangladeshi hindu kaa naam nahin lenaa chaahate jinka naam register main nahin aayaa
 Whereas everyone knows that this is why the citizenship law came
 ek hi baat he
 Do not name a religion
