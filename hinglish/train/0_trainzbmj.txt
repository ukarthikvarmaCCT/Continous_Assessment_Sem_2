 dhawan ne twitor par kuch tasviren bhi share kii thim
 Chief selector MSK Prasad was in Surat on Monday

 It is believed that Dhawan will not be able to fit before the three T20 matches series against the West Indies
 jyotish ke jaankaron kii maane to karwachouth kaa vrath har suhaagin kii jindagi sanvaar saktaa he, lekin iske liye is divya vrath se jude niyam or saavdhaaniyon kaa dhyaan rakhana behad jaruri hota he
 Fasting of Karvachauth and the correct method of worship will yield 100 times of this fast
 is vrath kii puja ke dauraan vrath katha padhane kaa bhi bahut mahatv he
 The popular fast of Karva Chauth was a Brahmin in the Kathaprachaic period
 uske chaar ladke or ek gunavati ladki thi
 Once the girl was in her maternal home, then Vakarpada of Chakarva Chauth
 brahman kii putree ne vrath ko vidhipurvak karte hue puure din nirjala vrath kiya
 All four of his brothers were upset that the sister would be thirsty, hungry, but the sister would take water only after the moonrise
 bhaaiyon se rahaa nahin gaya, unhone shaam hote hi bahan ko banaavati chandroday dikhaa diya
 a brother climbed a peepal tree with a sieve and lit a lamp and produced light from the sieve
 tabhi duusare bhai ne neeche se bahan ko aawaaj di- dekho bahan, chandramaa nikal aayaa he, pujan kar bhojan grahan karo
 The sister took food after offering the moon
 bhojan grahan karte hi uske pati kii mrityu kii khabar aa gai or is baat ko sunakar vah dukhi ho vilaap karne lagi, tabhi vahaan se rani indrani nikal rahi thim
 His sorrow was not seen from them
 brahman kanya ne unke pair pakad liye or apane dukh kaa kaaran poocha, tab indrani ne bataaya- tuune bina chandra darshan karvaa chouth kaa vrath tod diya isliye yah ksht mila
 Now if you keep the chowth for the whole year, your husband will be alive
 usne indrani ke kahe anusaar chouth vrath kiya to punah saubhagyawati ho gai
 Therefore every woman should do this fast for the longevity of her husband
 karwachouth kii duusari katha ke anusaarakate hai jab pandav van-van bhatak rahe the to bhagwaan shri krishna ne draupadi ko is divya vrath ke bare bataaya tha
 Due to this fast, Draupadi got the boon of the long life of her son
 draupadi ne yah vrath kiya or arjuna sakushal manovanchit fal praapt kar waapas laut aae
 Since then, Hindu women observe Karva Chauth fast for their unbroken harmony
 teesri katha:karwachouth ke vrath ko satyawan or savitri kii katha se bhi joda jaataa he
 According to this legend, when Yamraj came to take Satyavan's soul, Savitri gave up everything to eat and drink
 uski jid ke aage yamraj ko jhukna hi padaa or unhone satyawan ke praan lautaa die
 Fourth story: Once upon a time, a married woman named Karva lived with her husband in a village by the river
 ek din uskaa pati nadi main snaan karne gaya
 While bathing, a manger held her leg there
 vah manushya karvaa-karvaa kah ke apni patni ko pukaarane laga
 Hearing his voice, his wife Karwa ran away and came and tied the manger with raw thread
 magar ko baandhakar wo yamraj ke yahaan pahunchi or yamraj se kehane lagi, ‘he bhagwan! magar ne mere pati kaa pair pakad liya he
 Take that manger to hell
 ’ yamraj bole, ‘abhi magar kii aayu shesh he, atah main use nahin maar saktaa
 'got it done,' if you don't do it, i will curse you and destroy you
 ’sunakar yamraj dar gaye or us pativrata karvaa ke saath aakar magar ko yamapuri bhej diya or karvaa ke pati ko dderghaayu di
 Hey mother! Protect everyone's husbands as you protected your husband mumbai ke marine drive par subah tahalne vaale log seagal bird ko chips or duusare snacks khilaa rahe hai, jisase ve biimaar pad rahi hai
 Bird lovers have complained to forest and corporation officials in this matter
 bharat main aane vaale pravasi pakshiyon ke saath selfi lene ke liye log inhen namakeen se aakarshith karte hai
 This bird coming from remote areas in India is eating this salty with great fervor, but it is affecting their health
 bharat main behatar mausam hone kii vajah se har salhazaron pravasi pakshiyaha ke marine drive or girgaanv choupati ilaake par aate hai
 These birds reach here in search of fishes between January and March
 haalanki, pichley do hafton se yahaan log roj subah in pakshiyon ko namakeen khilaa rahe hai or inke saath photo le rahe hai
 According to the report of Mumbai Mirror, a senior citizen has complained about the matter to the wildlife officials and BMC officials
 unhone kaha ki log apane saath 5 se 10 kilo namakeen laate hai or in pakshiyon ko khilaate hai
 This is not only deteriorating their health, but also changing their eating habits
 pakshi visheshgyon ke mutabik isse na keval pakshiyon kaa pachan tantra bighad rahaa he, balki aane vaale dinon main unki prajnan kshamta par bhi asar padegaa
 Let me tell you that seagull is a sea-based bird and depends only on fish
 machhlee khaane se use hai protein or omega 3 fatty acid miltaa he
 While the salty that these birds are getting contains fat, salt and soda, it also harms birds along with humans
 in chidiyon ko bharat aane or yahaan se jane ke liye hajaaron kilometre kii udaan bharani hoti he, lekin namakeen khaane se unka liver fatty ho jaataa he, unke sharir main cholesterol bad jaataa he
 This will also affect their ability to fly

 Today, the Quit India Movement completes 75 years
 ye desh kaa aisa andolan tha, jisane angrejon ko desh chhodane ko majaboor kar diya
 On 9 August, the Quit India Movement started across the country
 8 agast 1942 ko bombai ke gowalia tanks maidan par akhil bhartiya congress mahasmiti ne ye prastaav paarit kiya to 'bharat chodo' andolan main puraa desh kud padaa
 The Quit India slogan on which the whole country was united, after all, who gave that slogan
 duniya yahi jaanati-samajhati he ki ye slogan mahatma gandhi kaa hi tha, par itihaaskaar isse ek sammat nahin hai
 Where did the sloganmedia reports come from, Congress leader Yusuf Mehrali's credit for writing Quit India's slogan goes
 kaha jaataa he ki ve gandhiji ke kaaphi kareeb the or unhone is movement ko aarambh karne se kuch samay purv hi gandhiji se mulaakaat kar unhen is slogan kaa suzav diya tha
 At that time Yusuf was the Mayor of Bombay
 swatantraaa sangram main ve 8 baar jail gaye the
 Who did Dawake Gopalaswamy wrote in his book Gandhi and Bombay that Yusuf was presented to QUIT INDIA in front of Gandhiji and Gandhiji accepted it
 yusuf ke biographer madhu dandavate ke anusaar, yusuf ne QUIT INDIA naam se ek bocolate publish kii thi
 This booklet was brought in the evening of the 1942 movement
 ukt photo unki hi kitaab se lee gai he
 He wrote in his book, "shantikumar Morarji has recorded that Gandhi conferred with his colleagues in Bombay on the best slogan for independence - when this was not stated
 One of them suggested ‘get out’
 Gandhi rejected it as being impolite
 Rajagopalachari mentioned ‘retreat’ or ‘withdraw’
 That too did not find favor
 Yusuf Meherali presented Gandhi with a bow bearing the inscription ‘quit India’
 Gandhi said in approval, 'amen'
 ” yusuf mehrali centre ke ko-founders main se ek jiji paarikh kehete hai ki yusuf ji ne 7 agast 1942 se pehle hi QUIT INDIA likhe kai baij print karaae the
 What was special was that this movement started under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, this movement was part of a well thought out strategy
 is andolan kii khaas baat ye thi ki isamen puraa desh shaamil hua
 It was such a movement that shook the roots of the British rule, Gandhi's historical speech Gandhiji gave a speech from the Gowalia Tank Ground
 unhone kaha, 'main aapako ek mantra dena chahta hum jise aap apane dil main utaar len, yah mantra he, karo yaa maro'
 Later this Gowalia Tank Ground became known as August Kranti Maidan

 Kangna's controversy started with Hrithik calling him Silly X, the day the controversy is unfolding with new secrets
 bollywood kii sabase badi war ban chuki kangana or rithik kii is war main abhi tak donon pakshon ke vakil hi maamle ko sanbhale hue hai
 Initially, even though Hrithik had made a few tweets in response to Kangana being called Silly X, but later the matter turned into a legal battle
 bollywood main isse pehle bhi stars ke bich unke aapasi rishton or baaki vajahon ke chalate khub takaraare hoti ain he lekinkangana or ritikki is ladaai ne jo tool pakadaa he usase shaayad koi bhi bekhbar nahin hoga
 Recently, there have been reports that Hrithik and Kangana are also upset with this fight, so they have decided to end this war
 chaahe is jodi kii takaraar kaa koi khaas nishkarsh naa nikle lekin ek baat to tay he ki kangana-rithik kii yah takaraar bollywood fites kii history main lambey arase tak yaad kii jaaegi
 hrithik-kangana Controversy: 5 things that strengthen Kangana's case
 The case started from where: Kangana used the word 'silly X' while giving Pinkvilla an interview
 darasal, kuch samay pehle khabar ai thi ki kangana ko film 'aashiqui 3' se rithik ke kehane par hi nikaala gaya tha
 When Kangana was asked about this, she said, 'I am hearing many strange rumors
 ek namasaz bhi andaja laga saktaa he ki ye afvaahen kahaan se aa rahi hai? main nahin jaanati ki eks aapaki atension paane ke liye is tarah kii paaglon jaisi baaten kyon karte hai
 From my side, this chapter is over and now i do not want to dig the grave of those things
 'iske thik baadaritikne twit karke kaha tha ki media jin mahilaon ke saath mere sambandh kaa zikr kar rahaa he, usase zyada sambhaavna he ki meraa sambandh kisi pope ke saath ho
 Now the question arises that Kangana did not even name Hrithik even once, then why did he get so chilly
 vaise, is cese main 5 baaten hai jinase kangana kaa palada zyada baari lagata he-1
 Bollywood actor Hrithik is a bit confused about his image
 bhale hi galati unki ho lekin vah hameshaa hi apane ko sahi sabit karne ke liye har koshish karte hai
 Not only Kangana, while announcing her separation with his first wife Suzanne, Hrithik blamed Suzanne for ending the relationship
 itnaa hi nahin sujain ko rishte main ai daraar kii asli vajah bataate hue ek statement jari kiya tha jis par sujain kaaphi bhadki bhi thim
 2
 rithik ne sili eks vaale bayaan par bina shart maafee maangane ke liye farvari main kangana ko notice bheja tha
 After this, Kangana retaliated and sent a notice that she did not say that Silly is an actor
 ab jab kangana ne ye sili eks kii oopaadhi kise thi, ye baat saaf hi nahin he to aakhir kaise rithik ne khud hi apane ko unka eks maan liya
 3
 apane notice main rithik ne is baat par jor diya he ki unhone kangana ke saath do filmon main kaam kiya he
 He says that there is no social, personal or any kind of intimate relationship between them apart from professional relationships
 sochane vaali baat yah he ki jab kangana ne apane rishte ke bare main koi coment hi nahin kiya to aakhir rithik ne is bare main safai hi kyon di
 4
 ye baat to jagajaahir he ki donon main se, vah kangana hi hai jo apane rishte yaa phir kisi bhi maamle ko lekar khulkar baat karti hui najar aati hai
 But Hrithik, be it movies or personal life, always seems uncomfortable while giving any statement on all these
 yahi vajah he ki jab rithik ne kangana se maafee maangane ko kaha to kangana ne saaf jawaab diya ki agar vah aisa chaahate hai to unhen apana najariya jagajaahir karnaa hoga kyonki blakemeling or dhamkiyon se mujhe koi fark nahin padataa
 5
 filmon ke kirdaar main hin nahin balki asal jindagi main bhi kangana bilkul queen hai
 Another thing goes in Kangana's favor that they have nothing to lose
 baat chaahe real life kii ho yaa phir reel life kii, kangana ne kabhi apni image kii chintaa nahin kii
 Neither is she afraid that she will not get films due to this controversy nor does she think what her family and her fans would think
 yahaan padhein : kyon rithik is maamle main bekasoor lagate hankangana, rithik legal war: bataaya ek duusare ko maansik biimaar, kangana ne bhejin 1439 i-melforensik report ne rithik ko di clin chit, kangana ke aarope galatis jang main chaahe shuruyaat main kangana ke aaropon kaa palada baari najar aayaa lekin baad main rithik ko bhi jari hue mels ke liye clin chit milane main deree nahin lagi
 a source associated with Hrithik said that Kangana had said that his email account was hacked, it is a lie
 ye baat ek forensik report se bhi sabit ho gai
 a forensic certificate has emerged in the hrithik-kangna controversy
 isamen kaha gaya he ki rithik ne kangana kaa i-mail acount hack karne kii koshish kabhi nahin kii thi
 What is the truth of the photo: In order to reveal the truth of their relationship with Hrithik, some pictures were released on behalf of Kangana, detailing the closeness of both of them
 lekin kangana ke photo relies karne ke ek din baad hi rithik kii team nednaadan kai tasviren daag deen
 Hrithik's team has tried to prove through these photos that the rumor of a relationship between Hrithik and Kangna about the party and photo being spread is wrong
 jari kii gai tasveeron ke jariye saaf kiya gaya he ki jis party main rithik or kangana kii photo lee gai, usamen sujain bhi maujuud thim
 Hrithik posing as a clarifier, Leerthik has leaked these pictures stating that Hrithik has no intimate relationship with Kangana
 jis tarah kaa poj rithik ne kangana ke saath diya, vaisaa hi us dauraan party main rahe baaki logon ke saath bhi diya
 Recently, a picture of Hrithik and Kangana was revealed, on the basis of which there was an affair between the two
 afaire kii baat se rithik kaa inkaarkangana ke vakil ne pehle saamne ai tasviir par kaha tha ki rithik or kangana ke bich kuch sambandh he or sirf profeshnal rishta hone kaa rithik kaa daawa galat he
 Significantly, this picture was taken during a party before the release of Krish film
 isliye rithik par bhi sawaal uthaae ja rahe the
 Hrithik denies any affair, while Kangana Ranot's side is the other
 rithik ke bachaav main unki eks patni sujain ne share kii tasvirkangana rithik war main saamne ai kangana ke kaale jaadu karne kii baat:'raaj 2' main kangana sang kaam kar chuke unke eks bwoyfriend adhyayan suman ne kangana ke bare main chaunkaane vaale khulaase kiye
 The study has revealed all this about Kangana - Kangana's real face should be revealed to everyone
 Recently the study has revealed many terrible secrets about Kangana's personality in an interview given to DNA
 adhyayan ne rithik-kangana vivaad main rithik kaa paksh lete hue akhbaar ko kaha he ki unka dard vah achche se samaj sakate hai kyonki vah bhi isse guzar chuke hai
 The study clearly stated that this is her last interview about Kangana
 isamen unhone bataaya, 'main chahta hum ki logon ko sachai kaa pataa chalanaa chahie
 i don't want to harm Kangana's career but how can she become innocent by targeting someone else
 kangana pehle bhi kai logon ke bare main galat baaten failaakar, unke kariyar ko chot pahunchane kii koshish kar chuki hai
 'kangana used to do black magic, while making another big disclosure about Nekangana, she said that she used to do black magic
 unhone bataaya, 'jab main kangana ke saath tha to vah mujhe ek pallavi naam kii jyotishi ke paas le gayi
 He told me that my time was not going well and that i would have to worship him to improve it
 iske liye kangana ne mujhe raat ko 12 baje apane ghar bulaayaa
 Kangna's apartment has a guest room
 us guest room ko unhone puri tarah kaale kapade se dhak rakhaa tha or vahaan bhagwaan kii bahut si murtiyon bhi thim
 Then Kangana locked me in that room and asked me to recite some mantras
 main bahut dar gaya tha or maine bina mantra padhe hi bol diya ki maine mantra pard liye
 a few days later, the astrologer told Pallavi to go to the crematorium at 12 o'clock at night to throw some things away
 main yah sunakar sann rah gaya or maine aisa nahin kiya
 Pandit said, Kangna was fed up with this revelation about the bloodshed, that the study said that he grew up in Metro City and did not know about all these things
 vah in sab se dar gaye the or is silsile main ek tero card reader se mili
 The study said, 'this tarot card reader said that something very bad is going to happen to me because some mountain magic has been done on me
 tabhi mujhe khyaal aayaa ki mere jaanane waalon main se sirf kangana hi he jo himachal se he
 i told my mother about this when they talked to our family pundit about it
 'adhyayan kaa kahana he ki is pandit ne mere saamne hairaan kar dene vaali baat rakhi
 They asked me if Kangana feeds you her own food
 mere is baat ko swikaarne par unhone kaha ki vah khaane main tumhen apana ashuddh khun milakar detii hai
 However, i ignored it then
 lekin kuch hi dinon baad hamaare rishte main bahut anban or marpet hone lagi
 The study says that then he used to cry the whole day and drunken all day
 unki haalat aisi thi ki vah tab mar bhi sakate the
 Abusing Galauch and assaulting Kanganaki's close association with Kanganarithik Roshan, the study said, Kangana grew up with Hrithik during the shooting of the film 'kites'
 unhone kangana or mujhe apni party main bhi bulaayaa
 But i was surprised to see Kangana's behavior in that party
 unhone mujhe bataaya ki koi unako ched rahaa he
 When i asked her to leave the party and she told me to wait, she went somewhere
 main vahaan bahut der tak baitha rahaa or uske baad vah achaanak ai or phir party se turant chalane ko kaha
 'but it was not that both of them left the party comfortably
 adhyayan ne bataaya ki sidhiyon se neeche utarate hi kangana ne unako jor se ek tamaacha jadaa or yah itnaa joardaar tha ki vah unke aansu nikal aae
 According to the study, Kangana started beating me again as we sat in the car
 maine driver se gaadi rokane ko kaha or car se baahar nikal aayaa
 At the time i was crying standing on the middle road
 jindagi kii wo raat main kabhi nahin bhul saktaa
 There are other incidents when i was extremely shocked by Kangana's behavior
 bataa den kikanganake marpet or gaali galoch karne vaale bartaav kaa adhyayan ne pehle bhi ek intervyuu main zikr kiya tha
 Kangana not on the revelation of the study, but the fans gave the answer in this way: After studying, she has made fun of herself after she accused him of doing black magic, beating meat and abusing her
 twitor par adhyayan kii in baton ko bebuniyaad bataate hue twitor yugers ne kai phani twits kar is gambhir masale ko kamedi kii disha kii or mode diya he
 Let us see how the revelations of the study are being pinched: 1

 Union Law Minister Kapil Sibal has said that the UPA government will announce the judge's name before May 16 to investigate Gujarat's 'snoopgate' (espionage scandal)
 sibbal ne bijepi netaa arun jetali ke us daawey ko bhi khaarij kar diya, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki koi bhi jaj narendra modi ko nishaanaa banane ke liye 'raajnneetik evam durbhaavnapurna' karrwai ke liye khud ko 'aage' nahin karegaa
 Sibal also said that the allegations against Modi in the controversy will be investigated
 unhone kaha, 16 may se pehle snupaget maamle main aapako ek nyaayadhish mil jayega
 i don't know why these people are so worried? Why are BJP leaders worried and why are they making public statements about any judge not joining this commission? sibbal ne kaha ki bijepi chintit he, kyonki uske netaa jaanate hai ki ek baar ayog gathit ho gaya to narendra modi ke paas bachane kaa koi rasta nahin hoga
 Sibal said, since there is documentary evidence of what he (modi) has done and how he has spied the activities of a young woman, they are worried about this commission of the Center and i think his concern will remain, Because the commission will be constituted, they will be investigated and they will be brought to justice
 kanoon mantri ne saath hi gujarat sarkaar dwaara gathit snupaget jaanch samiti par bhi sawaal uthaate hue kaha, yah kabhi aage nahin badhegaa, kyonki iskaa gathan mukhyamantri (modi) ne hi kiya he, jinke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kii maang kii ja rahi he
 He said, it will never go ahead like the Nanavati Commission
 12 saal guzar gaye, hamen koi report nahin mili
 Actually, this is the track record of the Gujarat government, so we have no hope from the state government
 gauratlab he ki guuruuvaar ko jetali ne ummid jataai thi ki nyaayik garima ko dhyaan main rakhte hue koi bhi nyaayadhish is 'raajnneetik evam durbhaavnapurna' karrwai ke liye khud ko 'aage' nahin karegaa
 As cliched as it may sound, my mother is my # girlhero
 She is a fiesty woman that came from a small town, who ran away from home to pursue her dream job
 
 
 she was a doctor in the armed forces, has over 8 different medical certifications, is a certified pilot and she speaks 9 languages! She also used to drive around in an open top jeep (what a badass!), Whew! She's also an amazing mother, daughter, sister, wife, business partner
 
 
 She's the one who taught me that i could be anything and everything i want to be
 
 
 And that's why she's my # girlhero
 
 
 it's so important to inculcate that sense of confidence in the girls around you and hopefully that's what we do this International Day of the Girl Child
 # dayofthegirl @girlupcampaign @madhuchopraa post shared by Priyanka Chopra (@priyankachopra) on Oct 11, 2017 at 10:22 am PDT antarrashtriya cricket se sanyas le chuke england ke purv captain andrew flintoff ne county team lankashair ke liye jabardast vaapasi kii
 Although Flintoff did not get a chance to bat in the Twenty20 match played against Worcestershire, he showed 2 wickets for 36 runs with the ball
 36 varshiya flintoff ne 2009 main ashes siries jeetne ke baad 2010 main cricket se sanyas le liya tha
 The same year he also announced his retirement from home matches
 apane jamaane ke baad mashhoor ol rounder flintoff ne england ke liye 79 test, 141 vanade or 7 T20 khele hai
 After this return, speculation of Flintoff's return to international cricket has also started intensifying
 match ke baad flintoff ne kaha ki sanyas ke 4 saal baad vaapasi karke khushi hui
 Flintoff wrote on Twitter 'it was also a good match for today's generation with 1-2 sixes by the new generation of batsmen'
 vartmaan main england kii vanade team or lankashair ke ballebaaj jos butler ne kaha ki maine kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki main andrew flintoff jaise mahaan khilaadi ke saath khel sakuunga
 He said that Flintoff performed well in this match and it was a great experience to play with him
 gujarat dangon se jude 2002 ke kai ahm records nasht kiye ja chuke hai
 The Gujarat government admitted this during the Nanavati Commission hearing
 yah baat us vakt saamne ai jab ipies adhikari sanjeev bhatta guzaarat dangon kii jaanch kar rahe nanavati ayog ke saamne pesh hue
 During the hearing, the Gujarat government itself admitted that the police phone calls and log books were missing
 gujarat sarkaar ke vakil esabi vakil kaa kahana he ki 2007 main vah sab records nasht ho chuk hai
 But people associated with the case say that the 2002 riots are still under investigation and this will have a very bad effect on the investigation
 isse supreme court bhi dangon kii tah tak nahin pahunch paaegi
 It is being said that the same records could have become important evidence in the case
 jansangharsh manch ke vakil mukul sinha kaa kahana he ki jab tamaam kanoonee karrwai jari he or aise main records ko nasht karnaa gaiyrkanoonee he
 There is now a question around whether these records were intentionally destroyed or part of the process

 pakistan yun hi aatankiyon kaa swarg ke naam se badnaam nahin he
 In this country alone, more than 70 thousand people have been killed in terrorist attacks only
 in halaat ke liye pakistan ke hukmran chaahe lakh bahaane dhundhen, magar haqiqat yahi he ki aatankwaad ko khatm karne ko lekar pakistan kabhi gambhir rahaa hi nahin
 Rather, he has been openly promoting terrorism
 aise main pulavama hamale ke baad ek baar phir dabaav main aakar hi sahi pakistan ne apane aatanki sanghathanon par karrwai kaa purana hatkandaa aazamaaya he
 Many terrorists are in custody, more than seventy organizations are banned
 lekin sawaal vahi purana he, ye bhi bas drama naa ho
 On 13 December 2001, the Indian Parliament House was attacked
 jisamen 9 logon kii maut hui
 The incident was accused of Maulana Masood Azhar, the leader of the terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed
 karrwai ke naam par masood azhar ko hiraasat main to liya gaya lekin ek saal baad sabooton kii kami ke bahaane kiya use azaad kar diya gaya
 26 November 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai
 jisamen 66 begunaah logon kii maut hui
 The attack was accused of Zakiur Rahman Lakhvi and Hafiz Saeed of terrorist organization lashkar-e-taiba
 karrwai ke naam par pakistan ne jaanch kaa bharosa diya
 Lakhvi was also arrested in December 2008
 lekin 9 april 2015 ko sabooton kii kami ke bahaane use bhi reeha kar diya gaya
 2 January 2016 Pathankot airforce station attacked
 is aatanki hamale main teen surakshakarmi shahid ho gaye
 The charge of carrying out the incident was on Maulana Masood Azhar, the leader of the terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed
 pakistan ne karrwai ke naam par phir masood azhar ko hiraasat main liya
 But a few days later refused to ask for all the evidence against him
 18 sitambar 2016kashmir main uri ke army camp par hamalaa kiya gaya
 18 soldiers were killed in this attack
 is ghatana kaa ilzaam bhi aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ke sargana moulana masood azhar par tha
 India then handed the dossier to Pakistan to take action
 tamaam saboot bhi die
 But the result was the same old that the Pakistani government refused all the charges
 ye wo record he, jise baja-baja kar pakistan ne puri duniya ko pakaa diya he
 Every time a new terrorist attack occurs
 har baar puure sabooton ke saath pakistan main fal-phool rahe aatanki sanghathanon par karrwai kii maang kii jaati he
 And every time Pakistan, after doing a few days of drama, frees all the criminals in the name of lack of evidence
 is baar bhi jab 14 farvari ko pakistan main baithe moulana masood azhar ke ishaare par jab aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ne pulavama main siarpief ke kafile par hamalaa kiya
 So perhaps he hoped that this time too India would demand action on terrorists from Pakistan with similar evidence
 lekin is baar pakistan kaa daanv ulta pad gaya
 Hindustan did not hand over the evidence at first, but instead attacked the Balakot camp of jaish-e-mohammed directly instead of looking for any help from Pakistani rulers
 bhartiya vaayu sena ne air strike kar aatankiyon ke adde par itane bam maare ki sabakuch dhuaan-dhuaan ho gaya
 It is another matter that at the behest of Pakistan, India also handed over its dossier as evidence
 jisamen hamale kii is saazish main shaamil aatankiyon ke naam pate ke saath-saath puraa lekha-jokha bhi darj tha
 Due to irrefutable evidence and air strikes, Pakistan has become so gritty in the whole world that this time it left another new Shigufa to preserve its rightful honor
 or ye shigufa air strike ke thik aathven din ek press conference kii surat main saamne aayaa
 When Pakistan announced to detain 40 of its terrorists and ban 70 terrorist organizations to show the world
 ab ise hindustan kaa dabaav kahen yaa phir kuch or pakistan ne jin 40 aatankiyon ko hiraasat main liya he, unamem masood azhar ke bhai abdul rauf or saalaa hamaad azhar bhi shaamil he
 Whose names have been written by Hindustan in its dossier
 jabaki pratibandhit sanghathanon main jaish-e-mohammad ke saath-saath jamaat-ud-daawa se lekar falaah-e-insaaniyat kaa naam bhi shumaar he
 But the biggest question is whether this action of Pakistan is also a part of the same drama
 Because the date is witness that Pakistan has never been serious about taking action on terrorists
 or kuch itani vajahon se saal dar saal pakistan main naa sirf hazaron aatanki lagaataar falte-phoolate, balki duniya ko lahooluhaan karte rahe
 In such a situation, until Pakistan does not punish these liberated terrorists as well as people like Masood Azhar, Hafiz Saeed, Lakhvi, Salahuddin and Dawood Ibrahim, they will be punished in prison or death
 , Who will believe this drama of Pakistan

 Kapil Sibal, who is representing Chidambaram, got into a tremendous cross-examination
 kareeb 40 minute tak chali bahes main kisne kya kaha? padhie yahanthushar mehta-ham chidambaram ko nyaayik hiraasat main bhejne kii arji laga rahe hai
 The plea challenging Chidambaram's remand to the Supreme Court has been withdrawn, unconditionally
 is cese kii pojishan abhi tak yahi he
 The old order has been withdrawn by the Supreme Court
 iske jawaab main pi
 Chidambaram's lawyer Kapil Sibal opposed the cbi's plea to send him to judicial custody
 unhone kaha ki agency ke paas na koi saboot he or na hi jail bhejne ke liye koi majboot aadhaar
 Kapil sibal-ye says that will scare the witnesses
 bataa den koun se gavaah se baat kii he, kyon inako nyaayik hiraasat main bheja jaae? sabhi sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin diya he? idi castady le le, mujhe koi dikkat nahin he, lekin nyaayik hiraasat main na bheje
 The court has the power to send ED to custody

 Who are you arguing over, are you arguing on bail? If you argue on bail then tell me, i will too

 Just want to send them to jail for harassing
 tushaar mehta-jaise hi remand khatm hoti he, hai court ke niyam ke mutabik ham apana bel maang sakate hai
 Kapil Sibal - will have to tell the CBI why it is necessary to be sent to judicial custody
 idi ko agar castady chahie, wo le, hamen koi dikkat nahin
 The case of Tusshar mehta-ed is different, it is a case of money laundering, if they get bail then they will tamper with the evidences
 jaanch main bahut dikkat hogi
 This is a big case and there is a lot of chance of tampering
 hamane kai deshon se is cese ke bare main jaankaree maangi he, cese ke ditels tak pahunchane ke liye kai deshon se jaankaree chahie, baahar ke deshon ke bainkon se jaankaree lene ke liye, un deshon se madad chahie hoti thi
 They have sought information from the UK, Singapore, Bermuda, Switzerland and the information coming from these countries may affect the accused
 hamane aaropee kaa kai logon se aamanaa-saamana karaayaa he, bhrashtachar kaa cese he
 Tushar Mehta did not stop here, he further said - this matter is related to economic crime
 yahaan jaankaree par hi puraa cese he
 There are only two options - first police custody, second judicial custody
 iske alaava kuch nahin he or agar aaropee bada aadmi he, tab use maamle main jamaanat nahin di ja sakati
 There are many such decisions of the High Court
 main aapako isi maamle main gavaah kaa bayaan detaa hum, aap dekhie, is par aaropee dabaav daal sakate hai
 Kapil Sibal: Is this person in custody? Tushar Mehta-ji not at all
 Kapil Sibal said that from July 2018 to September 2019, did the accused pressurize any bank? Not only this, but outside pressure put on agency of another country No, so how can we create pressure today? aaj tak avidence ke saath chidambaram par chhedchhad kaa koi aarope nahin laga he

 But now according to a study, women who work for 9 hours or more are more at risk of depression
 jarnal of epidemyology and community health main prakashit is study ke mutabik, jo mahilaayein ek hafte main 55 ghante se zyada kaam karti hai, unhen depressant hone kaa khatra 7
 Increases by 3 percent
 vahiin jo mahilaayein ek hafte main 35-40 ghante kaam karti hai, wo zyada swasth or tanaav mukt rahati hai
 Gill Weston, the lead researcher of the study, explains, 'we cannot explain the results of our study in more detail, but we have seen that women not only work in their office, but they also have to take care of their household
 iske chalate unke kaam karne ke ghante bad jate hai
 'it has also been told in this study that women who work on weekends are mostly from the service sector and their salary is less than others
 ab jab selary kam ho to insaan par tanaav to badhata hi he or phir wo depressant kaa shikaar ho jaati hai
 By the way, this study has been done on a very wide scale
 is study main 11,215 kaamkaaji mard or 12,188 mahilaon ko shaamil kiya gaya
 According to the study, both men and women suffer from depression due to working on weekends
 lekin mahilaon main depressant kaa khatra 4
 6 percent more
 bataa den, vishwa swasth sanghathan ke aakade bhi zyada utsahjanak nahin hai
 According to him, more than 300 million people are suffering from depression

 From April 1, this increase was not for income but to ensure that it would reduce crowdfunding on platform
 lekin sthiti ab yah ki plateform tikat ke daam najdiki railway stesan ke tikat ke daam se adhik ho gaya he or yatri plateform tikat kii jagah in najdiki steshnon ke tikat kataa rahe hai
 This has now become the problem for the railway officials
 ab railway stesan par apane sage sambandhiyon ko chhodane aane vaale log plateform tikat kii jagah local tikat le rahe hai jo unhen sasta pad rahaa he
 It is worth noting that in the passenger train, the ticket from Salem Junction to Salem Town is only five rupees
 itnaa hi nahin yah plateform tikat kii tulana main puure din ke liye vaid hota he
 Platform ticket is valid for 2 hours only
 yani plateform tikat kii keemat main ijapha hone ke baad yatri ab paisanger train tikat kaa durupyog kar rahe hai
 But now the railways have also found a way to monitor this misuse
 ab railway najdiki railway stesan ke liye paisanger train kii tikaten un trainon ke chalane ke samay ke kuch der pehle hi diya karegi
 Such tickets will not be given when there is no passenger train time
 iske alaava plateform par checking adhikari ko bhi nigaraanee badhaane kaa nirdesh diya gaya he
 These officials can deduct the challan of the passenger ticket holders who have been caught roaming on platforms other than the passenger train arrival and departure stations

 "beijing's idea is nothing to do with sovereignty disputes," was Beijing's idea of being advised by the Chinese government to feel the need to rename the corridor

 The displeasure of Nitin Patel, who was elevated as Deputy Chief Minister, has stirred up the party
 nitin patel ke tevar ko dekhte hue congress ne bhi un par ‘dore’ daalana shuru kar diya he
 After Hardik Patel's offer, now a senior Congress MLA has asked Nitin Patel to form the government with the support of 10-15 mlas

 An AN-32 aircraft made in Russia is an aircraft that was going from Chennai to Port Blair and it suddenly disappeared without giving an emergency signal in the early hours of flight

 The battery life of the ELT is about one month
 sambhav he transmeter malbe ke neeche dab gaya hodhikari bataate hai ki is ilaake main samudr kii gaharaai kareeb 3
 5 kilometers, where there will be strong sea pressure
 iskaa matlab he ek chote bakse ke aakaar ke eltii ke tut jane kaa khatra he
 Mainly if it was damaged at the time of the crash of the aircraft, the quality of the signal from the ELT could also be affected, as it may have been buried under the wreckage of the aircraft

 is massej ko viral hone ke baad jahaan vipakshi chutki lene lage
 Meerut Congress District President Vinay Pradhan praised party Vice President Ahul Gandhi, put a message on whatsapp and appealed to support him
 haalanki unhone is massej main rahul gandhi ko kai baar 'pappu' kahkar sambodhit kiya
 When the state Congress President Raj Babbar came to know about this, he took immediate action on this and removed Vinay Pradhan from all posts and suspended him from the party
 darasal pradhan ne rahul gandhi kii tarif karte hue likhaa tha-rahul gandhi jise desh kaa ek hissaa pappu ke naam se bhi jaanata he
 Today, do you tell whether Pappu ever grew fond of expensive vehicles? While he could raise
 kabhi ambani, adani, maalya kii party main shaamil nahin hua na, jabaki shaamil ho sakate the
 Did Pappu ever show grace? No, but could
 pappu mantri or pradhanmantri bhi ban saktaa tha par bana? nahin
 Whereas Manmohan Singh had already indicated to make him PM
 pappu se puure das saal ambani, adani milanaa chaahate rahe
 The government was in place from 2004 to 2014 and at a behest of Pappu, the ministers of the government could do their work, but Pappu did not give even 5 minutes to Ambani, Adani
 kyonki wo pappu tha, jaanata tha ki ye sarkaar se keval bijness karenge, garibon kaa khun chusenge
 They are afraid of not able to speak the flow of current, that is why the Sangh got engaged in the mission of making Pappu, but it is better to fight for the public with honesty than to give a lie in Hindi by giving a stream of speech

 Mohsin Raza said, 'this is the gift of nature
 allaah kii dein he bhagava
 This is not a gift of Yogi ji
 yogi ji ne isko dhaaran kiya he
 This is the gift of God
 allaah kii dein he
 That's why today the whole of Uttar Pradesh is illuminated because of Yogi ji
 mohsin raja se jab poocha gaya ki kya vah chaahate hai ki madrason main bhagava dress code ho to, unhone kaha, 'musalmaan pehle se bhagava pahante hai
 Khishwaja Moinuddin wears saffron from the Sufi Hamesh of Chishtiya Silsila who believe in Chishti
 jo chishtiyaan hai unase puuchhiye ki vah bhagava kyon pahante hai? mohsin raja sirf bhagava ke hi prashansak nahin
 He is also a big fan of RSS
 kehete hai ki 'raashtra kii niswaarth seva karne waalon ke sangh ko hi rashtriya swanyasevak sangh kehete hai
 If they are doing good work, then what is the objection? Along with this, Mohsin Raza also adds that 'he is sitting a little after opening the personal law board
 raashtra ke sevak hai
 He said that colors have also been divided among the growing divisions in the two religions in the society

 a Muslim may also like saffron color, but when Yogi ji's minister says so, people find more politics in it than they like

 Here, Katju commented on Jaitley, saying that the BJP leader has kept half the truth and he has come down heavily on personal attacks
 katju ne kaha, jab fasebuk prakaran ko lekar do ladakiyon kii giraftaar hui thi, tab maine maharashtra ke mukhyamantri kii bhi aalochana kii thi
 i also issued a notice to the Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh when he threatened to break the camera of a media person
 isliye maine congressi sarkaar kii bhi aalochana kii he
 The comments taaja vivaad gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke bare main ek angreji dainik main justise markandeya katju ke likhe lekh ke baad paidaa hua
 In the article, Katju has criticized Narendra Modi and appealed to the people of the country to choose the Prime Minister thoughtfully
 jetali ne kaha ki katju kaa bayaan purvaagrah se grasit he
 It is noteworthy that Katju recently attacked Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and said that there is no freedom of press in Bihar
 idhar, katju ne jetali par tippanee karte hue kaha ki bijepi netaa ne aadha sach hi saamne rakhaa he or vah nijee hamale ko lekar kaaphi neeche utar aae hai
 Katju said, when two girls were arrested for the Facebook episode, i also criticized the Chief Minister of Maharashtra
 maine himachal pradesh ke mukhyamantri ko bhi us vakt notice jari kiya, jab unhone ek mediakarmi ke camera todane kii dhamkee di thi
 Therefore, i have also criticized the Congress government
 tippaniyan The latest controversy arose after an article written by Justice Markandey Katju in an English daily about Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 katju ne lekh main narendra modi kii aalochana karte hue desh ke logon se apil kii he ki ve soch-samajhakar pradhanmantri chune
 Jaitley said that Katju's statement is prejudiced
 ullekhneey he ki katju ne haal hi main bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par bhi hamalaa karte hue kaha tha ki bihar main press kii aazaadee nahin he

 isi saal janvari main supreme court ke chaar varisht jajon ne abhootpurv kadam uthaate hue press conference bulaakar kai mudde uthaae or bataaya ki supreme court main sab thik nahin chal rahaa he
 If this happens, it will destroy democracy
 bada mudda tha bharat ke pradhan nyaayadhish deepak mishra kaa sunwaayee ke liye aae maamalon kii bench kaa aavanton
 He said that the Chief Justice "is the most senior judge among the judges of equality, not more than this
" sandarbh tha jaj bi

 is satr main do vaktaaon kii ek hi mudde par raay juda thi
 While Indira Jai singh believed that the executive is trying to influence the judiciary, according to Pinki Anand, the case was unnecessarily over-emphasized and the sanctity of the judiciary should be kept intact at any cost
 indira jaisinghwakil, supreme court''bhrashtachar tarah-tarah ke rup dhar letaa he, khaskar aaj ke sandarbh main karypalika kii manshaa ke aage ghutane tech dena to bhrashtachar ke sabase khatarnaak roopon main se ek hoga
 Every Chief Justice has the right to decide which case will go to which Bench and by exercising his authority it can be decided which way the trial will go
 yah is baat par nirbhar karata he ki aap nyaaypalika main kise pravesh de rahe hai
 If you are going to appoint people who agree with your views or are influenced by right-wing ideology, then it can be said that the judiciary is being politicized
 collegium ne uttaranchal ke jaj joseph kii niyukti kii sifarish kii thi
 Why has the government stopped it? More than six months have passed since the appointment was recommended
 supreme court main ek ajeeb-si shanti dikh rahi he lekin vastav main aisa he nahin
 Every time i enter the courtroom, my heart comes to my mind as to which side the judge in front of whom they will appear will stand
 yah ek jwalamukhi jaisaa hi he, isse kam nahin
 If there is no transparency, there is no freedom of expression, then democracy is hit
 jis desh main press aaazaad na ho, nyaaypalika nishpaksh na ho, vahaan phir kuch baaki nahin rahata
 Then forget everything
 "pinki anandbharat kii adishnal solicytor general''supreme court bhrasht ho hi nahin saktaa
 At this time, we have to stop the practice of seeing something suspicious behind everything
 har baat ke peeche sajeesh kii ashanka jataate hue kahana ki ''is baat kaa andeshaa he ki supreme court bhrasht ho gaya he
 There is some problem, due to which the judges were forced to go to the press
 " yah sab band karnaa hoga
 Something or the other thing is going on behind the scenes, it is better to stand with the institution than always be obsessed with this thinking
 jab aapke paas sarkaar ke teen ang maujuud hai to kabhi kisi tarah kii halchal, kisi tarah kaa utprerak, kisi prakaar kaa takaraav hone kaa andeshaa rahata hi he
 The fear of tension also cannot be ruled out
 yah is par nirbhar he ki ham baat ko kis str tak le jate hai
 Whenever it comes to issues related to social welfare in the world including India, you will find the judiciary protecting the rights of the underprivileged and the exploited

 At the United Nations, Imran Khan said that terrorism has nothing to do with any religion
 lekin muslim jab duusare deshon main jate hai to un par shaq kiya jaataa he
 23 times, the word terrorism was used by terrorists against India, Pakistan was talking about terrorism from UN platform
 imran ne apane bhaashan main 23 baar aatankwaad shabd kaa zikr kiya
 But then, not everyone feels that there is life beyond the jingoism of nuclear war, jihad, encouraging terrorism, war mongering, falsehood, deceit and misuse of the highest global platform

 Film Name: 'santa Banta Private limited'director: Akashdeep Sabystar Cast: Baman Irani, Veer Das, Neha Dhupia, Lisa Haydon, Ram Kapoor, Vijay Raj, Sanjay Mishra, Johnny Lever Duration: 1 hour 52 minutes Certificates: u / a Rating: 1 Star director Akashdeep Sabir has named the film quite attractive
 aaie jaanate hai yah film kisi he
 The story of the film is about the Indian 'high Commissioner' Shankar Roy (ayub Khan), who lives in Fiji, who is kidnapped
 unki tafsheesh ke liye bharat se sikret agentsasanta (baman irani) or banta (vir das)ko bheja jaataa he
 But upon reaching Fiji, there are many twists and turns in which Santa Banta gets trapped
 ab kya ye donon apane mishan main safal ho paaenge? ye jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Scriptfilm has good thinking but the script is very weak
 puri film main actors kii acting ke sivaay aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo aapako aakarshith kar sake
 Gheesi PT is the story and a very tired screenplay
 ikkaa dukka jagahon par hansi aati he lekin kahani ke saath boriyat dur nahin hoti
 actorsbaman Irani, Veer Das, Neha Dhupia, Ram Kapoor, Sanjay Mishra, Johnny Lever have all played their characters well, but due to the weak storyline, you wait for the film to end
 sangitafilm ke gane thik thaak hai lekin kahani ke dauraan koi bhi kaam aapako prabhavit nahin karata
 Weakest Link The weakest episode of the film is its story
 film kaa naam jitna aakarshak he utani hi boring film he
 Why see if you like Baman Irani and Veer Das very much, then you must see otherwise you look for some other option

 jiske baad police ne kailash ko bahari dilli ke ring road se giraftaar kar liya
 When the police investigated, a total of 30 pistols were recovered from Kailash's bag
 sabhi pistal behad badhia quality kii thi
 Seeing such a large number of weapons, the police also lost their senses
 taskar kailash ne poochtacha main bataaya ki ye saare pistal madhya pradesh ke khargun main bani hai
 On being strictly questioned, he revealed that he works in the gang of notorious crook Dinesh Raju
 police ne dinesh raju kii giraftaar ke liye team banaai he
 During interrogation, Kailash told that he had to sell the pistol to the local criminals of Delhi
 magar usase pehle hi dilli police ke hathe chadh gaya
 Let us tell you that Delhi Police has been campaigning against illegal arms smugglers for the last one year
 police ne khargun or bihar madul ke kai badmaashon ko giraftaar kiya he
 The police have seized more than 500 illegal weapons in a year

 kya aapako pataa he ki uttar korea main abhi-abhi chunaav hua he
 This election was to elect the new ruler of North Korea, the new government
 ek aise mulk main chunaav jahaan taanaashaahee he, jahaan taanashaah he
 There was also election and a new leader was also elected
 sabase kamaal kii baat ye he ki marshall kim jong un is chunaav main baari nahin balki sari maton se jeet gaye
 Now whose evening had it come that could have cut Marshal Kim Jong Un's vote? The scene is filmy
 
 The story is about a country where dictatorship was there
 duniya ke dabaav main taanashaah jhukta he
 Announces that there will be democracy in his country and the people will elect their own government
 chunaav kii taarikh tay hoti he
 People stand in queue to vote to choose their government
 janata taanashaah ke mukaable duusare ummidavaar ko vot daal rahi thi
 Just then a cannon is seen
 line badal jaati he
 The dictator wins the election
 duniya loktantric tareeke se chune gaye taanashaah kii bharpoor tarif karti he
 Now come out of this scene
 wo desh north korea he
 There is also dictatorship
 par taanashaah chunaav karana chahta he
 So that he can tell the world that he too has been elected democratically
 ji haa, ham uttar korea ke taanashaah marshall kim jong un kii hi baat kar rahe hai
 The world knows Kim Jong Un is a dictator
 uski marzi ke bina uttar korea main koi saans bhi nahin le saktaa
 If Kim Jong-un stands in the election, then whose courage is there for him
 par phir bhi uttar korea main chunaav hua
 Kim Jong Un stood in the election and also won the election
 par ye sab hua kaise
 Why did Kim Jong Un hold the election? How many candidates fielded in the election? How many people voted
 kim jong un ko kitne vot mili? kya kim jong un ke khilaaf bhi logon ne vot daale? voton kii ginati kisne kii? nattejey kaa elaan kisne kiya? chunaav kaa sanchaalan karne vaale koun log the? to bas intazaar kiijie
 You will get a series of answers
 10 march 2019 yani ravivaar ke din uttar korea main kul 687 siton ke liye chunaav hue
 In Pyongyang, pictures of Election Day came out
 jab korian log chunaav ko kisi utsav kii tarah manaate hue nazar aae
 Marshall Kim Jong Un of North Korea also participated in this election
 magar is jashn se pehle uttar korea main maujuud ek-ek shaks ne ghar se nikalakar vot kiya
 Because every citizen of North Korea needs to vote here
 lakhon kii taadaad main voter poling centre main jamaa hue
 But this time the election was completely different from each time
 kyonki yahaan ballat paper kii jagah is baar sirf ye card diya ja rahaa tha
 And the name of only one party was written on this card, Worker Party of Korea
 is card par lagane ke liye do hi mohar thi
 Yes 
 That means you are in support of this party and no
 yani aap is party ke khilaaf he
 In such a day, you must have understood what it means to say no to Kim Jong Un in North Korea
 duniya kaa ye iklauta aisa chunaav tha jisamen koi virdohi ummidavaar tha hi nahin
 Ideally, it should not be called an election
 kyonki isamen matadaata ko ballat par ummidavaar kaa chunaav karne hi nahin diya gaya
 In fact, he was given a warrant
 jis par haa kaa matlab zindagi or naa kaa matlab maut tha
 The result of this election has now come after about four and a half months
 desh kii sabhi 687 siton par varkar party of korea ke ummidavaaron ko nirvirodh jeet mili
 In India, just as there are elections for the Lok Sabha and states for the country, there are elections for the Supreme People Assembly and Local People Assembly
 har 4 saal main supreme essembly ke liye or har 5 saal main local essembly ke liye yahaan chunaav karaayaa jaataa he
 This election, held in March this year, was for the Supreme People Assembly
 uttar korea main hue is chunaav main 99
 Voting was 98 percent
 jin dashamalav 02 fisadi logon ne vot nahin diya wo sabhi darasal desh se baahar the
 Those who were sick or elderly were voted through mobile voting
 yahi vajah he ki pichhali baar ke mukaable is baar uttar korea kii voting percentage main sudhaar hua
 99 in North Korea last election
 97 fisadi vot daale gaye the
 it means that 
 01 percent voting main sudhaar hua he
 99 percent of the votes were cast both times
 uttar korea ne puri duniya main voting percent kaa apana hi record tod diya he
 that too 
 01 percent se
 This percentage of voting in North Korea is not surprising because the country which does not have the freedom to keep up its mind hairstyle
 vahaan apana manapsand ummidavaar chunane kii baat karnaa bhi bemaani he
 Like every time, Kim Jong Un himself voted
 south hamyong ke booth number 201 par kim ne vot daalkar apane deshavaasiyon ko bhi voting main hissaa lene kaa aadesh diya
 This is the result of the same order that 99 in the election
 98 percent voting hui
 Kim Jong Un is the head of the worker party
 or armd forces ke supreme head bhi
 By the way, North Korea is called Kim Jong Un by the 'democratic People's Republic of Korea'
 jo kehane sunne ke liye to thik he, magar yahaan kii demokrasi kaa haal duniya dekh rahi he
 Just for ritualism, but after almost four and a half months, the Election Commission of North Korea declared that the Worker's Party of Korea won all the seats in the election held on March 10 and 99 in favor of this party
 98 percent voting hui
 Let us tell you that no foreign agency has the exact information about how many voters are in North Korea
 lekin agar desh kii kul dhai karod kii aabaadi main 2 karod bhi voter maan liye jaaen
 So one hundred ninety-seven million and ninety-six thousand of them voted for Kim's party
 jinhone nahin kiya wo sirf wo log the jo desh se baahar the
 In North Korea, every 17-year-old person has the right to vote
 kul milakar is chunavi nattejey ke baad agle chaar or saal yani 2023 tak uttar korea ke marshall kim jong un ko phir se desh chalaane kaa loktantric adhikaar mil gaya he
 Even if it were not available, he would have run the country in dictatorial style
 kyonki mulk kii azaadi se ab tak is mulk main sirf kim khandaan kaa raaj rahaa he
 And now even the threat of the American shadow over Marshal Kim Jong Un's sultanate is almost over
 jo trump or kim ek duusare ko marane maarane par utaaru the wo aaj ek duusare kii tarif karte nahin thak rahe hai
 There is no doubt that this election happened in North Korea under the pressure of the world was just a ritual
 magar jis tarah yahaan ye ek tarafa chunaav hua wo zarur duniyabar charchaa kaa vishay bana hua he
 However, apart from the Worker's Party of Korea, other parties also participated in the elections that were held earlier
 magar is baar unhen chunaav ladane ke liye kim kii ijazat nahin mili
 What would have been known if permission would have seen a different scene at the polling booth

 For the past few months, Priyanka has settled the knot of the stuck alliance in a few meetings
 taaja jaankaree ke mutabik sapa ab 298 siton par or congress 105 siton par chunaav ladegi
 However, the situation in Amethi and Rae Bareli districts is not clear yet
 ummid jataai ja rahi he ki kuch hi der main gathbandhan kii aupchaarik ghoshnaa ho jaaegi
 Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel has tweeted that Priyanka and Akhilesh had a conversation for the sake of the alliance
 priyanka kii hoti rahi he demandupi kii raajnneeti main 27 saal se behaal congress ko jinda karne ke liye congressi netaa or kaaryakarta kai baar priyanka gandhi ko sakriy raajnneeti (khaskar upi) main aane kii maang uthaate rahe hai
 Posters and slogans like 'priyanka Lao Congress Bachao' and 'mayya raati ailing, Bhaiya pe bhaar gaya bhaar' have been seen many times for Priyanka

 She herself has personal connections with Amethi and Rae Bareli
 unke bachche bhi aksar amethi or raibareli jate rahete hai
 Priyanka important in this election a few days ago, a poster in Pratapgarh about Priyanka and Dimple went viral

 This is a record in Congress
 congress kaa sheersh dhada bhale hi rahul gandhi ko adhyaksh ke taur par dekhnaa chahta ho lekin congress main samay-samay par rahul ke khilaaf aawaaj bhi uthati rahi he
 There have been many slogans of 'rahul Hatao Congress Bachao', many times in the Congress, which is constantly facing defeat in elections
 aise main agar upi main sapa-congress kaa gathbandhan priyanka ke netritv main aage aayaa to priyanka ke liye pehali ining main shatak lagane jaisaa ho saktaa he
 PK has also placed a demand for the Congress, Prashant Kishor, who is campaigning in the elections for the Congress, has told the top leadership of the party many times that if they want to win the election, Priyanka has to be brought forward
 haalanki us vakt party ne unki is raay ko yah kah kar taal diya tha ki iske liye abhi sahi vakt nahin he
 Priyanka will be a star campaigner
 Now it is clear that Priyanka Gandhi will play an important role in the elections
 congress sutron ke mutabik is baar yah tay he ki priyanka apni maa sonia gandhi ke sansadeey kshetra raibareli tathaa bhai rahul gandhi ke sansadeey kshetra amethi se baahar bhi party ke liye chunaav prachaar karengi
 State Congress Election Campaign Committee Chairman Sanjay Singh also confirmed this in a conversation with a news channel
 unhone kaha tha ki, "ve (priyanka gandhi wadra) pradesh vidhansabha chunaav prachaar main ahm bhoomika nibhaaengi
 "even on Saturday, for the sake of the alliance, Priyanka Gandhi met Ram Gopal in New Delhi late on Saturday night

 The seat sharing was once again discussed in the meetings
 lambey samay se chal rahi thi gathbandhan kii batsapa-congress ke bich gathbandhan kii baat pichley teen maheenon se chal rahi thi
 Before the controversy erupted in the SP, Mulayam was in the mood for an alliance with the Congress when Akhilesh was not ready for it
 lekin, party main jhagade ke samay unhone khud gathbandhan ke liye baat kii thi
 After the alliance, the matter was stuck on the seats, which now seems to be resolved
 congress lagaataar pichheupi main congress ne aakhri baar narayan dutt tiwari kii aguwai main satta main ai thi
 Narayan Dutt Tiwari relinquished the Chief Minister's chair on 5 December 1989
 iske baad hue har vidhansabha chunaav main sapa badhati gai or congress pichhadati gai
 This is the political significance of UP
 The path of central power passes only through UP

 If we look at the figures, UP has 403 assembly seats, 80 Lok Sabha seats and 31 Rajya Sabha seats
 gujarat main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan narendra modi or congress ke bich jamkar jubaani jang ho rahi he or donon ore se keechad uchhaale ja rahe hai
 In Junagadh, the Congress leaders forcefully attacked Modi without naming him
 chunavi prachaar main maryaadaayen aksar tuutati hai or gujarat main to is baar ek dasre par keechad oochhaalane ke record ban rahe hai
 Congress, which often frustrated the Congress with its verbal weapons, retaliated strongly at the Junagadh rally
 gujarat congress ke adhyaksh ne bina naam kisi kaa naam liye kaha ki bandaron kaa sheron se kya muqabla
 Now there is no need to say on whose side was Arjun Modhwadia's point
 wo sher kise bataa rahe the or bandar kii tulana kisase kar rahe the
 The matter did not end here
 congress ke ek or diggaj ne lage haathon vivekanand gadakari ke bayaan par sawaal khadey kar die
 Issues are not being discussed in the election campaign
 chaahe modi ho yaa congress ke netaa, jab bhi jise mauka miltaa he, ek duusare ke khilaaf bhashaai jang hi hoti he or ek duusare par keechad hi uchhaale jate hai

 Very unfortunate aisi alokatantric karravaiyon kaa dat kar muqabla kiya jaayegaa
 In another tweet, he said - Has the bjp's central and state government been so scared and angry with the BSP-SP alliance that it has been bent on stopping them from doing their political activity and party programs etc

 NCP leader Sharad Pawar answered a question before meeting Congress President Sonia Gandhi, which surprised many
 unase poocha gaya ki shivasena kah rahi he ki vah sarkaar banane ke liye ensipi se baatcheet kar rahi thi
 Responding to this, Pawar said, "was that really so?" Let me tell you that Sonia Gandhi was ideologically wary of any alliance with the Shiv Sena
 kyonki shivasena, bijepi kii sahyogi party thi
 But she agreed to negotiate with the idea in Maharashtra that it would succeed in keeping the BJP out of power
 vahiin sonia gandhi or shivasena ke bich ensipi netaa sharad pavaar ek brij kii tarah najar aa rahe hai
 Several reports claim that Pawar had several discussions with Sonia Gandhi on the issue
 dilli main reportron ne pavaar se poocha, 'kya aapako lagata he ki shivasena, ensipi or congress kii sarkaar banegi?' is par jawaab dete hue pavaar ne kaha, 'shivasena or bijepi alag chunaav lade
 NCP and Congress fought separate elections
 aap kaise aisa kah sakate hai? unhen (bijepi-shivasena) apana rasta khud dhundhna hoga
 We will do our own politics
 'pavaar ke is jawaab par reportron ne kaha, 'lekin shivasena kah rahi he ki wo pavaar sahib ke saath sarkaar banaaegi
 
 
 ? To this Pawar responded with only one word
 unhone kaha, 'vastav main?'bataa den ki shuukravaar ko unhone ghoshnaa kii thi ki teen partiyaan saath aaengi or puure kaarykaal ke liye sarkaar banaaengi
 NCP mentor Sharad Pawar is scheduled to meet with Sonia Gandhi on Monday evening
 "chali bhale hi na gai ho sidhe-sidhe arthon main, 1947 tak gandhi kii naitik satta ek boj ban gai thi- ek karj – jo uttorattar baari lagane laga tha unke nikatatam sahyogiyon ko
 And for the first time Gandhi wanted his moral authority to remain
 dekh nahin paa rahe the ki jitna chaah rahe hai use banaae rakhana, utani hi nikali ja rahi he
 The more she ventured, the more she tried to maintain it
 " While reading the book 'gandhi: An impossible possibility' by the historian Sudhir Chandra, he came to this paragraph, remembering what Gopal Gandhi had said when he was given the Chameli Devi Jain Award last week
 gopal gandhi buddha or gandhi ke zariye bataa rahe the ki jo asahmati kaa rasta chunata he, uske liye spes yani jagah kam se kamatar hoti jaati he
 It is the responsibility of the state power to allow the space of disagreement to flourish
 sudhir chandra ne apni is kitaab main maatr 169 dinon kii man:sthiti kaa vishleshan kiya he, jise gandhi azaad bharat main ji sake
 In this book from Rajkamal publication, Sudhir has seen Gandhi going through the pain of failure in the circumstances of Gandhi's prayers, discourses, correspondence between Nehru, Patel and hindu-muslim tension
 jis ahimsa or satyagrah kii talim wo apane 32 saal ke andolan jivan ke dauraan gadhate rahe, wo bharbharaane lagi thi
 Gandhi could not recognize the Congress which he had inspired to move towards non-violence and satyagraha
 apane na sune jane kii pidaa ko gandhi baar-baar kehete hai ki ab meri koi nahin sunata tha
 Everyone used to listen to me once
 "par mere kehane ke mutabik to kuch hoga nahin
 Will be what Congress will do
 meri aaj chalati kahaan he? meri chalati to punjab na hua hota, na bihar hota, na noakhli
 Today nobody believes me
 main bahut chota aadmi hum
 Yes, i was a big man in India one day
 tab sab meri baat maanate the
 Today neither the Congress nor the Hindu accepts my word
 " This talk of Gandhi in the prayer meeting of 1 April 1947 portrays the place of his loneliness
 sudhir chandra kehete hai ki pehali baar nahin tha ki congress gandhi ko sun nahin rahi thi
 His relationship with the Congress was always movement
 tisek saal ke dauraan ve jitna congress main rahe the, utana hi baahar bhi rahe the
 Gandhi writes a long letter to Jawaharlal Nehru regarding Swaraj
 isi dauraan jawahar bhi kehane lage the ki gandhi ko samaj paanaa dushkar tha
 We often used to discuss their accounts and oddities among ourselves, and used to laugh a little bit that these accounts should not be encouraged after Swaraj
 swaraj gandhi kii aatma thi
 The story for Nehru is the craze
 sudhir chandra ne apni is kitaab main gandhi kii us lambii chitthee ko puraa kaa puraa chhap diya he or nehru kaa sankshipt jawaab bhi ki vakt milte hi vistaar se likhuunga
 Jawahar does not answer anything about Gandhi and later does not write in detail on this question
 main kahuunga ki saat lakh gaanv hai, to saat lakh hakumaten baniin aisa maano
 This is Gandhi's sentence which is now circulated by everyone
 postaron par chipka detaa he, magar saat lakh hakumaten bidio or tehsildaaron kii gulam bani hui hai
 If you want to see the corner of this loneliness of Gandhi, then you can go through this book
 shaayad akelaa pad janaa hi kisi bhi gandhi kii niyati he
 "I want to die by succeeding, not by failing
 par ho saktaa he ki vifal hi maruun
 "gandhi said this to Professor Nirmal Kumar Bose in Noakhali
 asafal hona bhi gandhi hone kii niyati he
 But neither Gandhi nor Gandhi can be democratic without Gandhi
 isliye wo asafal aadmi aaj bhi hamaare andar zindaa bachaa hua he
 Gandhi's swaraj had ended before his eyes
 congress swaraj kaa mazaaq udaane lagi thi
 To understand Gandhi's swaraj, the letter which he wrote to Jawaharlal Nehru should be read
 unka wo bhaashan bhi padhiye jo unhone 15 june 1947 ko prarthana pravachan main diya tha
 In the backdrop of hindu-muslim riots, there was increasing lewdness about non-violence
 sudhir likhte hai ki gandhi phir se ahimsa ke satya ko siddh karne main jute janaa chaahate the
 In this context, the experiment with Sohwardi, the leader of the Muslim League in Kolkata before Noakhali, living together in a riot-infested area home is amazing
 sudhir chandra ne jis tarah se un halaaton kaa vivaran diya he, wo kisi vartmaan ke samaan aakar khadaa ho jaataa he
 Gandhi gambles again
 apni zindagi daanv par laga dete hai
 The Congress had left Gandhi
 uske baad se ek-ek kar har dal ne gandhi ko chhod diya
 Even those who curse the Congress about Gandhi's words
 unhen apane andar jhaank kar dekhnaa chahie ki kya vaaki unke bheetar koi gandhi bachaa he
 Non-violence has survived
 swaraj bachaa he
 There is democracy in Gandhi's way, but there is no control of power
 hamane kisi tarah se maan liya he ki satta or netritv par niyantran hi mukti kaa antim maarg he
 How long have we been on a failed route
 kab tak chalate rahenge
 Gandhi failed to walk
 ham asafal hokar bhi unheen raaston par chale ja rahe hai
 How much difference is there in being Gandhi and how much fun is there in not having Gandhi
 chunavi elaan ke saath hi aam aadmi party ke mukhiya arvind kejariwal in dinon ek alag andaaz main piem narendra modi par hamalaa karte nazar aa rahe hai
 For the Lok Sabha elections in Delhi, with the beginning of campaigning, Kejriwal is talking about demonetisation and sealing among the people of Delhi and also telling himself to read and write
 dilli waalon se purna rajya ke naam par vot maang rahe arvind kejariwal janata ke bich agle 10 saal kii planning kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 During a public meeting during the campaign, he said that "I have come with full planning today, saying with responsibility that every family will get a house within 10 years", Arvind Kejriwal to strengthen his promise in 2015 Assembly Referring to one of his promises made before the election, he also told himself to read and write
 unhone kaha, "jab bijli half karne kii baat karata tha to bijepi vaale majaak udaate the
 Then, after coming to power, the price of electricity was shown cheaply within 1 month
 padhaa likhaa aadmi hoon, farji degree nahin he mere paas
 "further, Kejriwal said that BJP thought that these are the boys of Aam Aadmi Party, where did they come from in politics
 isliye centre main baithi bijepi kii sarkaar dilli kii aam aadmi party sarkaar ko kaam karne se roak rahi he
 Apart from this, Arvind Kejriwal made a unique appeal to not vote for the Prime Minister's face in the Lok Sabha elections
 kejariwal ne jansabha main aaye logon se kaha ki "is baar pradhanmantri banane ke chakkar main mat padana
 To vote in the same way as people had thoughtfully voted in 2015 and cleared 67 seats from the BJP to the Congress
 pradhanmantri pad ko vot na dene kii vajah bataate hue arvind kejariwal ne piem narendra modi par nishaanaa bhi saadhaa
 Kejriwal asked the people and while answering himself, he said, "modi ji got something by making him Prime Minister? Demonetised, closed people's business and shops
" isliye pradhanmantri ko vot mat dena, varanaa phir dilli ke kaam me adnga daalenge
 "arvind Kejriwal also accused PM Modi of not fulfilling Delhi's promise of a full state
 unhone kaha ki "pichley chunaav main modi ji ne dilli ko purna rajya dene kaa vaada kiya tha lekin 5 saal baad dilli purna rajya nahi bana, modi ji ne vaadakhilaphi kar di
 Therefore, this time to vote for the full state
 agar aam aadmi party ke saaton saansad aa gaye, phir chaahe pradhanmantri ke ghar main ghuskar dharna dena pade, dilli ko 2 saal main purna rajya bana denge

 The no-confidence motion brought by the TDP against the Modi government will be discussed and voted today

 In this way, the BJD has excluded itself from both voting and discussion
 maujuuda samay main loksabhaa main bijedy ke 19 saansad hai
 It should be considered a relief for the Modi government
 jabaki vahiin, vipaksh ke bada jhatka mana ja rahaa he
 On walking out of the Lok Sabha, BJD MP Tathagata Satpathy says, 'we do not want to participate in this debate
 ham avishvaas prastaav main shaamil nahin hona chaahate hai
 Because both NDA and UPA have cheated the people of Odisha
 unako barbaad kiya he
 We are not with anyone

 For us, the people of Odisha have issues

 Neither do you want to support NDA nor do you want to support UPA

 We are against both UPA and NDA

 Our aim is to think of the benefit of the people of Odisha

 In this way only 543 members are elected

 Therefore, the BJP needs only 267 mps to get a majority

 While the NDA has 313 members, the Shiv Sena has decided to stay out of the House

 sir par mailaa dhone kii pratha or dry latrine par lagaam lagane ke liye kanoon ke anupaalan par jor dete hue sarkaar ne aaj kaha ki kuch rajyon main dry latrine jari rahane ke kaaran yah pratha jari he
 In a written reply to the question of m Raja Mohan Reddy, Bocha Jhansi Laxmi in the Lok Sabha, Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment d Napoleon said that as per the report received from the states and union territories
 ,18,474 mailaa dhone vaale log or unke ashriton ke liye rojgaar evam punarvaas yojana par kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 He said that manual scavenging and dry latrine prevention law has been implemented in 23 states and union territories of the country, while reports of no dry latrine have been received in Manipur and Mizoram
 mantri ne kaha ki himachal pradesh or rajasthan main is prakaar ke apane kanoon he jabaki jammu kashmir ne abhi tak kanoon ko lagu nahin kiya he

 Surrounded by tremendous police security and settlement, a magnificent ten-storey building is being built today to accommodate the organization, which is continuously spreading
 is imaarat ko dekhakar kaha ja saktaa he ki aaj sangh or bijepi ke bich fark karnaa mushkil ho chalaa he
 This building is an expression of the great journey of the Sangh to reach the center of politics from the margins of culture

 It used to have 40,000 branches in 2010

 There is no "formal" structure of membership in the RSS but the growth in its branches has transformed it into a fertile recruitment center of the BJP, with the organization's interference in politics more than ever before

 There have been two such phases since the end of Emergency in 1977, when the size of the Union has expanded

 The slowness continued until 2010 after this period of boom
 uske baad ek baar phir prasar hona shuru hua jo aaj tak jari he
 The current phase is also very political

 This original character is defined by another Sarsanghchalak Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar in his book "bunch of Thoughts", "the RSS is not just a school teaching ideas and ideals
" yah charitra nirmaan kii vyaavhaarik shiksha dene vaali paathshaala he
 "politics has never been on its agenda
 bhaalaa kehete hai, “bijepi kii har rajya ikai main sanghathan sachiv aresas kaa tainaat kiya hua koi prachaarak hi hota he, par kuch saal pehle tak sangh ke bheetar raajnneeti ko naa-naa hi kaha jaataa rahaa
 However, Sangh's publicity chief Manmohan Vaidya says, "what people see as a change in the RSS is a natural evolution
" man bachapan se hi sangh se judaa rahaa hum or yahaan kabhi bhi swasth or nawachaari vichaaron se parhez nahin kiya gaya he
 “what is the reality, it is known from the election in-charge of the four states where the elections are currently being held

 In Assam, Ram Madhav, a senior leader of the Sangh who was instrumental in the bjp's battle this year, was appointed by the Sangh to keep pace with the BJP and has managed the bjp's campaign campaign with party president Amit Shah

 Among the first to draw attention to this was an American political scientist, Paul Brass, who stated that the spread of union among backward castes began during the Ayodhya movement
 kaaryakartaaon kaa ek nayaa aadhaar bana, usamen zyada obisi or dalit aae, to sanghathan ke bheetar aarakshan or dalit agenda par bhi shiddat se bahasein hona shuru ho gayi
 The Sangh is aware that despite the overwhelming victory of 2014, bjp's total vote percentage was 31 percent, which is just one-third of the voters
 saaf he ki hindu vot jatiyon main banta hua he
 That is why efforts are being made today to create such a saffron rainbow through greater inclusion, including those Hindus whom the Sangh has kept out of its purview for a long time, ie Dalits and Adivasis
 sangh jaanata he ki hindu samudaay ke bheetar kareebi sahyog or sadbhaavpurn sambandh kaayam kiye bagaiyr bharat kii “khoi viraasat” waapas paane or rashtron kaa aguva banane ke liye saanskrithik or naitik kayakalp kii uski mahatvakanksha sudur sapana banakar hi rah jaaegi
 The three-day RSS-BJP coordination meeting between 3 to 5 September 2015, chaired by Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat in Delhi, ended with the support of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government

 hamane 1977 se 1980 or khaskar 1998 se 2004 ke bich hue ghatnakram se kaaphi sabak liya he or aaj ham kahin zyada samajhadaar ho chuke hai
 "however, insiders say that Modi has overshadowed the leadership of the Sangh by persuading the Sangh to strategically pursue an inclusive agenda based on social solidarity and development by the end of the current term of its government
" Have done
 unhone sangh se vaada kiya he ki anuchhed 370, ram janmabhumi or ghar vaapasi jaise mudde unke agle kaarykaal main zyada aakraamakata se uthaae ja sakate hai
 Now it would not be difficult to understand why the Sangh has started slowly sorting out the "cultural" cloak which was used to identify itself in the early days
 pichley kuch varshon ke dauraan sangh ko raajnneeti main hissedari karne kii prerana dene vaale mukhya kaarak uski santhnik takat or ek purv prachaarak kii aitihaasik jeet rahe hai
 Coordination meetings are a yardstick for political cooperation between the most important constituents of the Sangh Parivar, but the question arises whether this confidence has changed the core character of the Sangh? But Mohan goes to the pragmatism of Bhagwat, who is considered within the Sangh Parivar to be "the connective, balancing and political vision"
 unhone march, 2009 main sudarshan kii jagah lee thi
 Bhagwat's personal relations with BJP leaders are very warm
 unke pita madhukarrav bhagwat gujarat ke praant prachaarak the, isliye mohanji- jaisaa ki sabhi unhen pyaar se bulaate hai- gujarati main daksh hai or khaskar pradhanmantri modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke saath unke rishte kaaphi madhur hai
 Like the third Sarsanghchalak Devaras, Bhagwat does not hesitate from political involvement
 bijepi ke bheetar peedigat badlaav ke praneta rahe bhagwat ne apane ird-gird dattatreya hosbale or krishna gopal jaise aresas ke yuva netaaon ko juta rakhaa he
 Indeed, the metamorphosis of the Sangh is most visible among these new "liberal" faces
 sahasarkaarywah or sangh main tisare number par hosbale mridubhashi kannada brahman hai or angreji sahitya ke chaatr rah chuke hai
 Keeping away from the Sangh's protectionist thinking, he made a historical statement in India Today Conclave, "why did the RSS suffer from homosexuality? As long as it does not affect the lives of others it is not a crime
 yon praathamiktaayen nijee maamle hai
 "this is not only a departure from the party line, but they are also advocates of having more women within the Sangh
 bhagwat ne khud sangh ke bheetar mahila shashaktikaran se sambandhit kai pahal yojit kii hai
 Realizing that the Sangh has often been dismissed as a pure gang of men, she organized a two-day women's ordination in 2014 in Ghaziabad, where women from all organizations affiliated to the Sangh Parivar were given a platform
 sangh ke akhil bhartiya sahasampark aniruddh deshpandey, raashtra sevika samiti kii pramukh sanchalika ve

 Last year, in a two-day meeting held in Vrindavan, the leaders of the Sangh had instructed their affiliated organizations to make women officers
 sangh ke paas mahilaon kaa ek majboot sanghathan he, jiskaa naam he raashtra sevika samiti
 Its job is to organize Hindu women for national activities
 yah sanstha 1936 se hi sangh ke saath saamanjasy main kaam kar rahi he
 In March this year, Bhaiyaji Joshi raised the demand for women to enter temples across the country at the All India House of Representatives in Nagaur, Rajasthan
 is nae or samaveshi sangh ke bheetar daliton or mahilaon ko zyada sahaj mahasoos karaane ke liye bad rahe prayaas darasal unki sahabhaagita ko badhaane ke vyapak prayaason kaa hissaa hai
 The efficient use of technology by the Sangh has played a role in getting thousands of people registered on the RSS website
 aresas i-shakhaaen bhi lagaataa he, jisamen sahabhaagi online hissedari kar sakate hai or din ke kisi pehle se tay vakt par log in kar sakate hai
 The move will appeal to young and busy professionals who may not be interested in visiting traditionally branching branches
 pichhali 3 janvari ko sangh ne pune ke najadik shiv shakti sangam kaa aayojan kiya
 It was a gathering of around 85,000 activists and 50,000 supporters in full uniform
 do vishaal parade lagaae gaye or aayojan kii live strimming internet par kii gai
 Another shocking change in the primitive culture of the Sangh is that it has started teaching English in its Saraswati Shishu temples
 sangh kaa naaraa hua karata tha “hindi, hindu, hindustan
 When Narendra Modi as the Chief Minister of Gujarat introduced higher grade English as a second language in government primary schools, he was strongly opposed by the Sangh-affiliated Gujarat Vidya Bharati

 Since the suicide of Rohit Vemula, only Dalit questions have been wandering in the minds of Sangh leaders

 While Rohit Vemula's suicide is being seen as a setback, within the Sangh Parivar, the most fierce debate is currently going on between Swadeshi versus foreign
 sangh se sambhddha sanghathan bhartiya majdoor sangh, bhartiya kisaan sangh or swadeshi jaagran manch koyala kshetra ke sudhaaron, shram sudhaaron or khudara kshetra main 100 fisadi pratyaksh videshi nivesh ke muddon par sarkaar ke virodh main hai
 In January 2015, the Modi government attempted to push the Coal Mines (special Provisions) Bill that would open up the sector to private companies and give the government a waiver of e-auction of coal blocks

 Naidu started discussing the no-confidence motion presented by the TDP and countered the failures of the Congress government on every front
 naidu ne kaha, hamaara avishvaas prastaav na keval mukhyamantri ke, balki mantriyon ke bhi khilaaf he
 This government has lost our trust to govern

 We have public confidence and that is why we are in power

 You are a sealed envelope Chief Minister and your leadership is spineless

 The central government has started a new exercise to tackle the problem of NPA- Non Performing Assets standing in front of public sector banks in the country
 saal ke shuruyaat main bainkon ko enpie se mukt karaane ke liye janvari main kendra sarkaar ne 2
 Approved Rs 1 lakh crore recapitalization program
 vahiin ab vah sarvaadhik enpie anupaat vaale IDBI bank ko desh kii sabase badi insurance company life insurance corporation of india (LIC) ke hawaale karne kii taiyaari main he
 LIC holds the majority of the country's deposits and withdraws thousands of millions of rupees from its savings every year and puts it into lic's policy
 is paise ke sahare uskaa or uske parivaar kaa bhavishya surakshit rahata he
 But now the Center is going to hand it over to LIC in a bid to save a government bank
 iskaa saaf matlab he ki aap prativarsh jo paisa elisi kii policy ke liye bataur premium jamaa karte hai ab uskaa istemaal bank ko doobane se bachaane ke liye kiya jayega
 Why the question? But is this decision in the interest of lic's customers in the country? Does this decision of the Central Government guarantee that idbi's NPA problem will be resolved? And in the end, will this decision secure lic's customers the biggest investment of their lifetime? What is IDBI Bank's situation right now? Currently, the Central Government holds 85% stake in IDBI Bank, one of the 21 state-owned banks in the country
 vitt varsh 2018 ke dauraan kendra sarkaar ne apane ricapitaliseshan program ke tahat bank kii madad karne ke liye 10,610 karod rupee daalaa he
 On the other hand, IDBI Bank is the bank with highest NPA ratio among ill-treated banks in the country
 beete kuch varshon ke dauraan banking sudhaar ke naam par kendra sarkaar ne biimaar pade sarkari bainkon main apni hissedari ko kam karne kii ranneeti par kaam kiya he
 Under this strategy, it is easiest for the Central Government to reduce stake from IDBI as IDBI Bank does not come under the Nationalization Act and will not face any legal hurdle in reducing stake
 vahiin desh kii sabase badi jivan beemaa company elisi lambey samay sebanking kaarobaaramen jagah bananaa chaah rahi he
 The main reason for this is the large amount of capital lying in it which is collected as premium by LIC policy customers across the country
 haalanki purv main kendra sarkaar ne elisi ke paas pade is paise se adhik kamai karne ke liye use share bazaar main nivesh karne kii bhi manjuuri de di thi
 This decision also increased the risk on lic's customers deposits
 vahiin khud elisi banking main entry ke liye purv main na sirf IDBI balki lagbhag sabhi sarkari bainkon main kuch hissedari kharid ke baithi he
 Therefore, at present, when the Central Government is making an exercise to relinquish IDBI stake in the name of banking reforms, there is an opportunity for LIC to create a bank for itself
 faisle kaa vaktagauratlab he ki kendra sarkaar is prastaav par insurance regulator kaa darwaja khatkhata chuki he
 The regulator has to decide on the deal on Friday
 vahiin maujuuda samay main bina bank hue bhi elisi lone market kaa ek bada khilaadi he
 During FY 2017, LIC lent more than 1 trillion rupees to the debt market and to maintain the same debt business, it has acquired some stake in almost all the public sector banks
 lekin ab khud bank kii bhoomika main aa jane ke baad elisi ke saamne bhi vahi chunauti hogi jiske chalatejyadaatar sarkari bankgande karj baantkar enpie ke jaal main fanse hai
 At the same time, there is no guarantee that LIC has the ability to run a bank independently and is more capable than any other public bank in securing public money
 police upayukta (uttar-pashchim) asalam khan ne bataaya ki 16 varshiya ladkaa kathith taur par keemtee saamaan churaane ghar main ghusaa tha, lekin ghar ke maalik ne use pakad liya or sthaneey logon ne use peet-petakar maar daalaa
 a police officer said that a case has been registered in this regard at Bhalswa Dairy police station
 bihar main madrasa main pard rahe chaatro ke liye ek kushkabari he
 Though Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is running the government in the state with the help of BJP, the state cabinet has approved the scheme of incentive for students studying from madrasa to Maulvi and Foucania
 filhal bihar main metric main pratham shrenee se paas karne vaale chaatro ko das hazaar or intermediat main pratham shrenee vaale chaatro ko pandrah hazaar kii raashi di jaati he
 The state government has approved the proposal of the Department of Minority Welfare and decided to implement it from the current financial year
 dini ke saath duniyavi talim bhi, virtual class room se jude do madrase This decision of Nitish Kumar's government will surely spark a happy wave among the people of the Muslim community as there has been an atmosphere of uncertainty towards Nitish Kumar since he has been with the BJP
 haalanki bhaajapa ke mantriyon ne aisi yojana kaa kabhi virodh nahin kiya lekin rajd kii taraf se hameshaa ek aarope lagaaya jaataa hai ki nitish kumaar ab muslim or alpsankhyak samudaay ke prati vyavhaar pehle jaisaa nahin rahaa
 The comments VIDEO- daarul-ulum nizaamia main 1947 se fahraaya jaataa rahaa he jhanda RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari on Tuesday cited a continuation of the speech by Nitish Kumar in spite of the azaan from the Bagal mosque
 tiwari ke anusaar nitish kumaar ne apane party main ye niyam banaaya tha ki kabhi bhi namaaz yaa ajaan ke samay bhaashan ko jari na rakhaa jaae lekin ab vah khud yah niyam bhul gaye hai
 Worldly education with Dini, two madrasas associated with virtual class room nitish kumaar kii sarkaar ke is faisale se nishchit rup se muslim samudaay ke logon main ek kushi kii lahar daudi hogi kyonki jab se wo bhaajapa ke saath gayi hai to unke man main nitish kumaar ke prati ek anischitata kaa maahaul he
 Although BJP ministers never opposed such a plan, there is always an allegation from RJD that Nitish Kumar is no longer behaving towards Muslims and minority communities
 tippaniyan Flag has been hoisted in darul-uloom Nizamia since 1947 rajd netaa shivanand tiwari ne mangalvaar ko ek sarkari kaarykram main nitish kumaar dwaara bagal kii masjid se ajaan ke baavjood bhaashan jari rakhane kaa hawala diya
 According to Tiwari, Nitish Kumar had made this rule in his party that the speech should never be continued during namaz or azaan but now he himself has forgotten this rule

" ’’ucchtam nyaayalay ne pichley saal 27 april ko esaiti se jakiya kii us shikaayat kii jaanch karne ko kaha tha, jiske tahat unhone modi or unke cabinet sahyogiyon, police adhikariyon or varisht naukarshahon sahit 62 logon par aarope lagaaya tha ki unhone dange main madad kii or dangon ko uksaaya, jisamen 1,000 se adhik log maare gayi the

 ucch nyaayalay ne yah kehete hue is yachika ko khaarij kar diya ki sit sidhe ucchtam nyaayalay kii nigaraanee main kaam kar rahaa he
