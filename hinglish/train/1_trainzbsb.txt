 The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) said in a report on Friday that it had benefited unfairly by allowing Reliance Power to use coal in addition to the three coalfields allocated to the Sasan Ultra Mega Power Project
 lekin company ne aarope kaa khandan kiya or kisi bhi galati se inkaar kiya
 The CAG report on ultra mega power projects for the last financial year was tabled in Parliament on Friday
 koyala mantralay ne reliance power kaa anumati di thi ki vah saasana pariyojna ke teen khadaanon ke atirikt koyale kaa upyog madhya pradesh kii apni anya pariyojna ke liye kare
 According to the CAG, the bidding process had deteriorated
 report main kaha gaya ki reliance power ko kul 29,033 karod rupee vittiya laabh hua, jiskaa mulya abhi 11,852 karod rupee he
 The comments reliance power ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari jepi chalaasaani ne report kaa virodh kiya or kaha ki isamen pehle kii tarah kai khamiyaan hai
 He said that additional coal flow was not carried out in any other direction, as alleged
 unhone kaha, "koyala kshetra boli lagane kii prakriya se pehle hi saasana ko aavantit kiya ja chukaa tha
 "he said that it doesn't matter who the developer was
 mantriyon ke adhikaar praapt samooh ne bhi do maukon par faisle ko manjuuri di thi
 He said, "we made a presentation to the government auditor at least twice
 " unhone kaha ki lekhapareekshak jis tarah se nishkarsh par pahunchaa he, usase kai jagah par sarkaar bhi sahamat nahin hui he

 pichley kaarobaari saal ke liye ultra mega power projects par sieji kii report shuukravaar ko sansad main pesh kii gai
 The Ministry of Coal had allowed Reliance Power to use coal for its other project in Madhya Pradesh in addition to the three mines of the Sasan project
 sieji ke mutabik isse boli lagane kii prakriya kharaab hui thi
 The report said that Reliance Power had a total financial gain of Rs 29,033 crore, which is currently valued at Rs 11,852 crore
 tippaniyan Reliance Power CEO JP Chalasani opposed the report and said that it had many flaws as before
 unhone kaha ki atirikt koyale kaa pravaah kisi or disha main nahin kiya gaya, jaisaa ki aarope lagaaya gaya he
 He said, "the coal field had already been allocated to Sasan before the bidding process

 'sar, meraa ghar dekh lijie, meraa to sab barbaad ho gaya
 Being a backward caste, i did not get a place in the Cyclone Center
 aap inke ghar nahin dikhaaenge to log naaraaz ho jaaenge
 If you come, show them, see that their back is broken
 mere paas kuch nahin he
 If you help, i will be able to live, otherwise i will die
 ' logon kii yah sab awaajen abhi bhi mere kaanon main gunj rahi hai
 When i was wandering in different villages of Puri on 15 June, i did not think that people would be struggling even after 45 days of Cyclone phony
 bhubaneshwar se kareeb 120 kilometre dur meri gaadi jab krishna-prasad block ke liye nikali, tab mere man main kai sawaal the
 As my car continued to move slowly, all the questions got answered
 raste ke chaaron taraf bikhare hue ped or toote hue makaan dekhakar main samaj gaya cyclone phoni kitna khatarnaak tha
 First of all, we reached Balbhadrapur village in krishna-prasad block, people gathered at the sight of our car
 logon ko laga sarkaar ke taraf se shaayad koi madad karne ke liye aayaa he lekin unka bhram dhire-dhire dur ho gaya
 On seeing my kit bag on which NDTV was written, people understood that i am from the media
 ek yuva mujhe vahaan le gaya jahaan anusuchit jati ke log rahete hai
 On my way to go ask me are you from NDTV? i answered yes
 raste main usne kaha ki kya main sach main unki samasya ko dikhaaungaa, maine kaha ki koshish karuunga
 He said that the national media had come there a few days ago, but went after talking to the officer
 logon kii samasya nahin dikhaae
 i came to know from his words that people are angry about the media
 yah gussa jaij bhi he
 The reporting that should have taken place after the phony cyclone did not happen
 zyaadaatar patrkaar cyclone kii hawa kamjor hote hi vahaan se nikal pade
 Those journalists kept measuring Cyclone's impact with the death of people
 agar zyada maut nahin hui to cyclone kaa prabhaav nahin he
 If this is the thinking of journalists, then journalism is over
 45 dinon baad cyclone kaa asar vaisaa hi he jaisaa pehle din rahaa hoga
 Let's get to the real issue, the young Pravesh Kumar took me to the scheduled caste colony
 is basti main anusuchit jati ke log ek kone main dhakel die gaye hai
 i do not know about other states, but in most villages of Odisha, Scheduled Castes live in the last part of the village or in some corner
 mere gaanv kaa bhi yahi haal he
 i was shocked to see the broken house of these Scheduled Castes
 ghar kii chat ud gai he
 There is no luggage inside the house
 diwaar tuuti hui he
 Rita Maalik took me to see her house
 jaise ghar ke andar ghusaa to dekha saamaan ke naam par bhagwaan kii kuch murtiyon or kuch kapade rakhe hue hai
 The owner told that the owner sleeps at night, not in the house
 abhi bhi use dar he kahin tuuti hui diwaar upar gir na jaye
 i met Kaveri Malik in Balbhadrapur
 umr kareeb 30 saal ke aasapaas rahi hogi
 Kaveri was cooking with a small child in her lap on an earthen stove
 kaveri maalik ne bataaya ki cyclone centre main unhen rahane kii jagah nahin di gai
 Even in the destruction some people remembered that they are gold and they did not forget to realize that some people belong to the scheduled caste
 kaveri apana chota baccha lekar ek jagah se duusari jagah bhaagti raheen
 No food was found for three days
 aakhir ek skool main thikaana mila
 Kaveri said, 'when the cyclone started, we went to the cyclone center
 centre main bahut log the lekin phir bhi kuch jagah bachi hui thi
 We were not given a place
 hamen kaha gaya ki ham anusuchit jati ke log hai
 Then we went to school
 skool main ham dhai dinon tak bhukhe rahe
 There was neither light nor food
 vahaan kuch nahin tha
 i had a small child, he had fever but there was no medicine
 aashaa vaala number dekar gaye the lekin phone nahin uthaaye
 There is still a lot of untouchability here
 dukaan jate hai to nahin choote hai, skool main bachche jate hai, unhen alag baithaaya jaataa he
 When they go to eat food, they sit separately
 purush log bhi ham logon ko nahin choote hai
 We live in the corner of the village, nobody touches us
 hamaare paas bhi koi nahin aata he'kaveri kii yah baat sunakar main sann rahaa gaya
 i remember as soon as i was leaving, Kaveri was saying that the caste system should end
 yah bhi boli ki kya uskaa khun kaala he or duusare kaa laal
 On hearing Kaveri, a question also came in my mind that why is this caste system so much in Puri, area of lord Jagannath? When Lord Jagannath himself is the God of all castes and all religions, all see him, all touch his chariot during the Rath Yatra, then the upper caste people consider Jagannath as their God
 us bhagwaan se kuch sikh kyon nahin paae
 Cyclone Phoney has also taken away the jobs of the people here
 bans se saamaan banaakar yah log bech rahe the lekin kai logon ke paas bans kharidne ke liye paisa nahin he
 Earnings are halved
 balbhadrapur gaanv ke baad hamaari gaadi duusare gaavon kii taraf chal padi
 We reach Bhoisei village
 is gaanv kii sthiti or bhayaavah he
 As soon as we came to know that we have come from the news channel, everyone became restless to show their house
 yahaan zyaadaatar logon ke gharon kii chat udi hui thi
 Shanti took Pahan to show her home
 shanti paahan kii chat puri tarah ud gai he
 Shanti Pahan has built a bamboo house, but there is no electricity in the house
 dhibree main shanti paahan kaam chalaati hai
 a short distance away is Basant Pahan's house
 basant paahan ke pati nahin hai
 Due to cyclone, the wall broke and fell on the head, there is still bandage on the head
 45 dinon baad bhi basant apane ghar kaa saamaan nahin sahej saki hai
 There is no one to help them
 ek betaa he jo bahut chota he
 Basant got a thousand and some rice in the name of relief, but the kabaka was over
 basant ne kaha agar use madad nahin milegi to wo mar jaaegi, sar tuutane ke vajah se wo khud kaam karne nahin ja paati he
 Many such people have been found victims of cyclone
 kisi kii qamar tut gai to kisi kaa pair tut gaya
 They need medical help
 bhoisahi ke log mujhe us jagah le gaye jahaan ek saath khaanaa banataa he
 There is a small hut here
 din main gaanv ke bachche yahi padhate hai kyonki cyclone se skool tutaa gaya he
 Food is made near this hut
 khaanaa ke naam par chaaval, jise oriya main bhaat kaha jaataa or dalma
 Dalma means vegetable is added to the lentils
 alag se sabji nahin banani padati
 In this village all the people gather to eat food
 alag se kisi ke ghar main khaanaa nahin banataa
 The people here told me that the people of the village eat food only once, because even if they eat food for a little while at three o'clock, they will not feel hungry at night
 agar bhukh lagati bhi he to biscuit or chuda kha lete hai
 If you are thinking that the government is feeding food then you are thinking wrong
 khaanaa sarkaar nahin balki mumbai ke you mumba kabddi team khilaa rahi he
 This team of Ronnie Screwvala feeds 1200 people here everyday
 hamen nahin pataa tha ki aisi koi team chupchaap kaam kar rahi he
 How much the country gave to cricket, how little Kabaddi got
 magar jitna mila kabddi apane hisse se in logon ke liye kuch kar rahi he
 Who would not like to see this
 mujhe to bahut hi acha laga
 Because of this cyclone the Banjara community also suffered heavy losses
 bhoisahi gaanv ke kone main do banjaaraa parivaar rahete hai
 They have neither land nor house, where the place is found, they stop by putting up tents
 inke paas na pahchaan patr hai, na pramaan patr
 That is why they do not even get relief material
 rajalakshmi das ne mujhe bataaya ki wo pichley 20 saalon se apane bacchon ko lekar ek jagah se duusare jagah gum rahi hai
 Rajalakshmi has neither land nor house
 cyclone ke dauraan jab gaanv ke logon ne sahaara dene se manaa kar diya to rajalakshmi ne skool main chhipakar apane bacchon kii jaan bachaai thi
 Rajalakshmi told that there was nothing to eat during the cyclone
 teen dinon tak apane bacchon kii bhukh biscuit or chocolate se dur kii
 The shop was torn down during the cyclone, with biscuits and chocolate on the way
 rajalakshmi yah sab jamaa kar rahi thi or apane bacchon ko de rahi thi
 So you can understand what was the condition of these people during the cyclone? Cyclone does not see caste, does not see religion, destroys all
 sab kaa nuksaan karata to phir in logon ko raahat saamagree kyon nahin?bhoisahi ke baad ham arkuda gaanv ke liye nikal pade
 Chilka Lake is a source of livelihood for millions of fishermen
 cyclone ke baad inkaa sab kuch chin gaya
 1200 fisherman families of Arkud village are struggling
 cyclone main in sabhi kii naaven tut gai hai
 There is no work even if there is no boat
 sarkaar ne kaha he ki naav banane ke liye paise degi, lekin abtak kuch nahin mila he
 These fishermen told that it costs 40 to 50 thousand to build a boat
 naav banane main do maheene se zyada samay lag jaataa he
 In such a situation, when they will get money, when they will fix their boat, it is a matter of concern
 saamaajik kaaryakarta sandip patnayak ne bataaya arkuda gaanv ke log puri tarah chilka ke upar nirbhar karte hai
 Patnaik says that the government has given money to license boats, but what will happen to fishermen who do not have licenses
 patnayak ne bhi bataaya kai sanstha yahaan raahat dene ke liye aati hai, lekin itane saare logon ko dekhakar bhaag jate hai
 If i did not go to all these villages, i would not have known about the people's problems
 main sirf kuch gaanv gaya hum lekin is block ke lagbhag har gaanv kii kahani yahi he
 Every village has a new problem, a new story
 mujhe pataa chalaa ki kai gaanvon main pine kii pani kaa bahut samasya he
 People are drinking dirty water
 us gaanv tak jane ke liye mere paas samay nahin tha
 It was dark
 in gaanvon main kahin lite nahin thi
 Anchors who debate Hindu Muslim topics while sitting in AC studios should also take note of these problems of the people
 agar media logon kii samasya dikhaane main fail he to phir patrakarita khatm he
 Media does not mean TRP
 agar tiarapy hi dekhnaa he to phir aap studio main das logon ko baitaakar dibet karte rahiye lekin yaad rakhiye ek samay aisa aayega, jab aap ke paas sab kuch hoga lekin wo patrakarita nahin hogi jisaki duhai dekar aap aage bad rahe hai

 Flames vaayu pradooshan se sirf shaareerik hi nahin maansik bimariyon kaa bhi khatraakharaab air quality se logon main bipolar disorder or depressant badhadooshit hawa yaa kharaab air quality sehat ke liye bahut kharatnaak he
 The most impact of air pollution is on the health of the elderly, children and pregnant women
 fefdon ko nuksaan pahunchane ke alaava vaayu pradooshan se ab kai tarah kii maansik bimariyon bhi ho raheen hai
 This has been revealed in a recent study
 america or denmark main lakhon rogiyon ke swasthya data ke aadhaar par ek study kii gai
 The study states that both countries have similar disease
 chicago vishvavidhyalay or is study ke mukhya shodhakarta andre rejtski ne kaha ki vaise to maansik beemaari ke bahut kaaran hote hai lekin vaayu pradooshan ek nayaa kaaran banakar ubhara he
 However, this study is also being criticized and people have advised to do more research on this subject
 vahiin vishwa swasthya sanghathan (dablyuechao) kaa anumaan he ki vaayu pradooshan se har saal lagbhag 7 million logon kii maut hoti he
 Let us tell you that India is also in a very poor position in terms of air pollution, especially the air quality of delhi-ncr is constantly falling
 dilli main piem 2
 Level 5 remains dangerous
 dilli ensiaar kaa air quality index 300 se upar ja chukaa he, jo ki khatre kii ghanti he
 Overall, the air level in Delhi ie AQI has reached 306 mark
 jaane stress dur karne ke sahi tareeke Lieutenant General PK Rath, who is facing court martial in the Sukna land scam case, has alleged in the Delhi High Court that after his nomination as Deputy Chief of Army Staff, Eastern Command has taken steps to take action against him only with malicious intentions
 rath ne yahaan ucch nyaayalay main apni yachika main daleel di he ki unhen is maamle main nishaanaa banaaya gaya he or unke khilaaf lagaaye gayi aarope pehle hi tay kar liye gayi the
 Rath, in his 24-page petition filed on Thursday, said that the leadership of Lt
 Gen
 VK Singh, who was designated as Army Chief after the Cabinet Appointment Affairs Committee approved him to be promoted to the post of Deputy Chief of Army Staff
 The Eastern Command has taken steps to set up a 'court of Inquiry' against him
 unhone daleel di he ki unke dwaara up sena pramukh kaa padbhaar grahan kiye jane ke thik pehle unhen kolkata sthit mukhyalay se sambhddha karne kaa aadesh dena atyadhik bhedbhaavpurn or manamaana aadesh he
 Rath lashed out at VK Singh for his role saying, "an order was issued to associate the petitioner with a malafide intent to prevent him from assuming the post of 'deputy Chief of Army Staff'
" ’’purv sainya sachiv leftinent general avadhesh prakaash ke saath rath us maamle main court marshall kaa saamana kar rahe hai, jiske tahat sena ne ek nijee real estate vyavsaayee ko darjeeling sthit sukna sainya chhavnee se sate 71 acre bhoomi ko ek shaikshanik santhaan banane ke liye anaapatti pramaan patr jari kar diya tha
 Rath has said that the charges against the petitioner were pre-determined and even without giving the petitioner a chance to exercise his authority under the Army rules
 unhone kaha ki is maamle main doshi paye gayi anya adhikari jahaan apane pad par barkaraar hai, vahiin unhen 33 veen kor commander se hataa diya gaya
 It is worth mentioning that if Rath is found guilty in the army investigation, he may face court martial, while other officials including Prakash have to face a relatively soft step ie administrative action
 satta main aane ke daanv-pench, satta main bane rahane ke hatkandon se alag hote hai
 The bigger challenge is to stay in power than come to power
 agar ummiido kii laharon par savaar ho kar satta main aaen to ye chunauti zyaada badi ho jaati he
 a challenge where every moment has to be tested and every test has to be met
 ek chook aasmaan se jameen par patake sakati he
 Like happened with BJP in Delhi
 par bengalooru se bijepi ek alag andaaj main waapas ja rahi he
 It is on its way to becoming a natural party of power
 satta kii swaabhaavik party hoti he jahaan ek sarvamaanya, shaktishaalee netaa hota he
 Government and party are in his hands
 jahaan virodh, asahmati yaa asantosh ke sur jayakaare main dab kar rah jate hai
 The organization of the party becomes huge
 party chunaav jeetne kii ek aisi mashin ban jaati he jo din-raat isi kaam main juty rahati he
 His mobility pulls this giant organization in one direction
 makasad hota he satta main bane rahanaa or zyaada se zyaada satta hasil karnaa
 Prime Minister Modi said that the party is supreme
 sarkaar to uddeshy puraa karne kaa saadhan maatr he
 BJP today is the largest party in the world with ten crore members
 apane boote par bahumat hasil kar chuki modi sarkaar das maheene puure kar chuki he
 There is no conflict between the party and the government
 bhoomi adhigrahan or jammu-kashmir main pidipi ke saath gathbandhan ke muddon par party or sangh parivaar se awaazen uthin
 But after Bengaluru it has been said that the party fully supports all the decisions of the government
 bhoomi adhigrahan par shuruyaat main etraz karne ke baad ab party puure desh main iske paksh main muhim chalaane ke liye taiyaar he
 The message from Bengaluru is clear - BJP is very happy with the ten months of the Modi government's functioning
 modi sarkaar ke har faisle kaa bijepi samarthan karti he
 Narendra Modi has complete control over the government and the BJP
 ooljulal bayanon or harkaton se media main surkhiyaan bator kar sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon se dhyaan hataane vaale party netaaon par sakhti kii taiyaari he
 Modi is now the supreme leader of the party and the government
 atal-adwani yug to kabhi kaa khatm ho gaya tha magar ab us par puri tarah se pardaa gir gaya he
 If the government moves ahead on its agenda, the party will be engaged in strengthening the organization
 jin rajyon main kamjor he sari takat vahaan lagaai jaaegi
 Bihar elections will decide a lot
 vahaan manamafik nattejey aane par bengal, assam, tamilnadu or kerala ke chunaavon main utsaah ke saath jameen majboot karne kaa kaam hoga
 But the shock of Bihar will create problems for the party as well as the government
 ek majboot netaa ko apni party se jaise samarthan kii darkaar hoti he, bengalooru main modi ko vaisaa hi samarthan mila he
 In the closing address of the meeting, he said that 'we have managed to bring change
 ye badlaav hamaari team se hi sambhav hua he
 The change has brought not just me but the entire team
 ' ye bayaan 'main nahin ham' kii bhaavana se diya gaya he
 But still the party and the government have a long way to go in showing it and showing it
 unhone likhaa he, 'priy sarbanand sonoval, maine aapako kuch din pehle aapako khat likhaa tha

 loksabhaa main 23 july ko sarkaar kii ore se pesh kiye shram sudhaar ke do vidheyakon ko lekar sambandhit pakshon kii ore se kadi pratikriyaayein dekhne ko milin
 Although the Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed in Parliament, another bill — Occupational Secrets, Health and Working Conditions (OSHWC) Code, 2019 — stuck in both lower and higher houses
 upar se dekhne par lagata he ki ye donon hi bill shramikon ke kalyaan ko sunishchit karne vaale or saath hi kaarobaar ko bhi aasaan banane vaale hai
 The Code on Wages Bill talks about improving the rules for remuneration (salary) and bonus payments
 iske alaava rashtriya str par ek nunatam vetan ko anivaary bananaa bhi shaamil he
 The purpose of OSHWC is to improve working conditions
 november, 2018 main antarrashtriya shram sanghathan ne kaha tha ki 31 pratishat bhartiya shramik kharaab sthitiyon main kaam kar rahe hai, jabaki unamem se 41 pratishat kaa kahana tha ki unhen bahut kam vetan diya jaataa he
 Due to this, India's position among the 22 countries of the Asia Pacific region was pitifully low at 19th
 in vidheyakon ke bare main prachaarit kiya ja rahaa tha ki sarkaar desh ke jatil shram kanoonon ko saral banane ke saath hi unamem sudhaar karnaa chaahati he
 For example, there are 11 definitions of 'salary' alone under different laws
 nayaa prastaavit kanoon sabhi kendriya kanoonon ko chaar code (samhitaon)—vetan, audyogic sambandh, saamaajik suraksha or audyogic suraksha evam kalyaan—main samahit kar degaa
 The Code on Wages Bill incorporates four central labor laws — the Pay Payment Act 1936, the Minimum Wages Act 1948, the Bonus Payment Act 1965 and the Equal Remuneration Act 1976 — within it
 oeechadblusi main 13 kanoonon ko ek saath jod diya gaya he jinamein kaarkaana kanoon, anubandh shram (niyaman evam unmoolan) kanoon, antarraji pravasi shramik kanoon, or kai anya kanoon khaskar bidi mazdooron, cinema shramikon, bhawan nirmaan main lage mazdooron, bagan mazdooron, motor parivahan mazdooron, cells pramotion karmchaariyon or shramjivi patrakaron kaa niyaman karne vaale kanoon isamen shaamil hai
 This reduces the number of 622 sections of all laws to a total of 134
 udyog par najar rakhane waalon ne in do vidheyakon kii tarif karte hue kaha he ki bharat main kaarobaar ko aasaan banane kii disha main yah ek acha kadam he
 Chairman of the National Committee on Industrial Relations of the Indian Industry Association (CII)
 es
 Unnikrishnan has said that the new codes (codes) will prove to be helpful in violating the provisions of minimum wage and preventing exploitation of workers
 lekin vipaksh, shram sanghathanon or kuch shram kanoon visheshgyon kaa aarope he ki sarkaar shramikon ke maujuuda sangrakshan ko kamjor karnaa chaahati he
 The biggest criticism has been that these bills cover only establishments with 10 or more employees, thus ignoring 85 per cent of India's labor market
 ye vidheyak 500 karmchaariyon se kam sankhya vaali companiyon ke suraksha nirikshanon ko gata rahe hai
 And the entire information-technology sector, which comes under a separate law, is outside the purview of these bills
 rajyasabha ke purv sadsy or vam-samarthit centre of indian trade unions (siitiu) ke mahasachiv tapan sen kaa kahana he ki code on vegej bill main nunatam vetan ko tay karne kaa koi formula nahin diya gaya he jisase yah puri kavayad kendriya salaah board ke vivek par chhod di gai he
 Apart from this, the government has also rejected the recommendation to limit the working hours of the day to eight hours
 unka kahana he ki nunatam vetan se sambandhit praavdhaanon ko keval 'karmchaariyon' par lagu hone vaala bataaya gaya he, na ki 'shramikon' par
 They are defined differently
 par shram kanoonon ke visheshgy jeet singh maan kehete hai ki companiyon ke maalik yaa niojak is tarah ke shabdon ke khel kaa phayda nahin uthaa sakate
 He says, "this is a drafting mistake
 par kanoon shramikon ke adhikaron ke bare main spasht he or kisi bhi shramik ko nuksaan nahin hoga
 "other experts have highlighted the flaws in these bills that go in favor of the employer, not in favor of them for whose benefit they have been made
" code on vegej bill mukhya niojak ko jimmedaariyon se alag karata he or 'aniyamittaaon' kii sthiti main sari jimmedaariyaan karmchaariyon kii aapurti karne vaale contractaron par daal detaa he

 di
 Scholars Aakriti Bhatia and Chandan Kumar, who work in the Working People's Charter, wrote, "this will give further impetus to the contractual practice of labor
 ''in kanoonon ke kuch anya praavdhaanon ko bhi karmchaariyon ke shoshan ko badhaava dene ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 For example, apprentices will no longer be considered employees, although they often work on contractual employees or permanent employees
 ascharyajanak rup se, is code main ''15 varsh se kam umr vaale karmchaaree'' par ek praavdhaan kaa ullekh he
 According to Bhatia and Kumar, "this can be seen as a step towards legalizing child labor
" ''visheshgyon ne 'vasuuli-yogya agrim raashi' vaale kaale praavdhaan ko shaamil kiye jane kii kadi aalochana kii he
 This can lead to troubled and vulnerable migrant workers working in the unorganized sector who are willing to accept advance payments, trapped in a bond of forced labor
 yah supreme court kii us kanoonee dharna kaa ulanghan he jo saaf taur se agrim bhugtan ko bandhua mazdooree se jodta he
 Those provisions also go in favor of the employer, who no longer considers non-payment of salary a punishable offense and reduces the fine
 maan ke anusaar, ''yah bahut chintajanak baat he ki us karmchaaree ke liye kisi tarah kii suraksha uplabdh nahin he jo niojak ke khilaaf shikaayat karnaa chahta he
 He says that Section 20 of the Code on Wages Bill, 2019 provides that if an employee is absent even for one day without notice, the employer can deduct eight days' salary
 ve kehete hai ki yah praavdhaan 'kaam nahin, vetan nahin' se bhi aage chalaa jaataa he, jisamen niojak ko karmchaariyon kaa vetan chura lene kii chhot mil jaati he
 The UPA government first thought of encapsulating labor laws into four codes, but they did not have enough numbers in Parliament to take this proposal forward
 yah bill sabase pehle loksabhaa main agast 2017 main pesh kiya gaya tha or use sansad kii sthaayee samiti ke paas bhej diya gaya tha jisane apni report disambar, 2018 main de di thi
 But after the dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha, the time of this bill came to an end
 iske baad nayaa bill taiyaar karke pesh kiya gaya jisamen sthaayee samiti kii ore se banaai gai kai siforishein jod di gayi
 "there is no dearth of labor laws in India," says Jeet Singh Mann
 bas unhen thik se lagu nahin kiya gaya he

 haalanki, kesiar ne abhi tak samaajawaadee party, bahujan samaaj party, biju janata dal va wiesar congress se baat kii he yaa nahin, ise lekar koi jaankaree saamne nahin ai he
 But as the election is reaching its end, the statements of these parties are definitely seen emphasizing the efforts of KCR
 samaajawaadee party ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav kah chuke hai ki kshetreey dal bahut majbootee se lard rahe hai or is chunaav main unki bahut badi bhoomika he
 Akhilesh has also claimed that who will be the next government and who will become the Prime Minister, a decision will be made by the SP-BSP-RLD alliance
 upi main majbootee se lard rahaa yah gathbandhan na sirf bijepi ke khilaaf khulkar chunavi maidan main he, balki gathbandhan ke netaa congress ko bhi har din khari-khoti suna rahe hai
 On the other hand, the role of Trinamool Congress President Mamta Banerjee, who unanimously ruled the third largest state of the country in terms of seats, is also considered to be very important
 haalanki, wo khud kolkata main sabhi bijepi virdohi dalon ko ek manch par laa chuki hai, jiske baad pradhanmantri pad ke liye bhi unke naam par charchaa hone lagi thi
 At the moment, a big picture of the current Lok Sabha elections is also that for a long time before the elections, the Congress has been taking the initiative to bring anti-bjp parties together and was able to defeat Narendra Modi
 lekin chunaav aate-aate alag-alag rajyon main congress kaa kshetreey dalon se gathjod nahin ho paaya, jiskaa nateeja ye hua ki mahagathbandhan kaa swaroop rachane vaale sabhi dal chunaav main alag-thalag dikhaai die
 In such a situation
 chandrashekhar raav ne paanchaven charan kii voting ke baad kshetreey dalon se mulaakaat karne kaa jo kadam uthaaya he wo kaaphi myne rakhata he, kyonki unhone hi pichley saal march main sangheey morche kaa vichaar pesh kiya tha or bhaajapa va congress donon kaa ek vikalp pradaan karne kii pahal shuru kii thi
 In this episode, KCR met leaders of Trinamool Congress, Biju Janata Dal, Samajwadi Party, Janata Dal (secular) and DMK
 unhone wiesar congress party ko bhi prastaavit morche main shaamil hone ke liye aamantrit kiya tha
 In such a situation, it will have to be seen whether the results coming on May 23 bring back the bjp's power again or the results that bring the non-bjp and non-congress parties together

 BBC India has released a full video of his conversation with Singh on his Twitter handle to confirm his claim and said that the Minister of State for External Affairs had also used the word "prostitute"
 unhone kaha tha, sena kisi kii nahin hoti he
 The army only belongs to the country

 According to RBI data, where India had a foreign exchange reserves of $ 427 billion as of mid-april, now it has come to $ 400 billion
 iske alaava haal hi main kendriya rigerv bank ne apni vaarshik report main khulaasa kiya tha ki usne apane sone ke bhandar main 8
 Has increased by 46 metric tons
 report ke mutabik arabiai ne yah kharidari vitt varsh 2017-18 ke dauraan kii thi
 566 currently in the Reserve Bank's treasury from this purchase
 23 metric ton sone kaa bhandar he or rigerv bank ke mutabik yah kharidari usne apane videshi mudra bhandar ko majboot karne ke liye kiya he
 Money market experts believe that this central bank's exercise was also to support the falling rupee level, but this move also did not have any significant impact on the movement of the rupee
 GST ho lagu to turant 89 se 60 rupee litre aa jayega petrol, dijal hoga 50 kalihaaja ab kendra sarkaar or kendriya rigerv bank rupee kii giravat ko lagaam lagane ke liye videsh main rah rahe bhartiya nagarikon kaa sahaara lene kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 With this move, the government hopes to be able to reduce its current account deficit
 gauratlab he ki kendriya bank ne isse pehle 2013 ke dauraan apravasi bharatiyon kii madad lee thi or rupee main dollar ke mukaable darj ho rahi lagaataar giravat ko sanbhaalane main safalataa pai thi
 According to RBI data, the UPA government led by Manmohan Singh and the central bank had swapped currency worth about $ 34 billion from nris and managed to stop the rupee depreciation
 is skim ke jariye arabiai videsh main baithe bhartiya nagarikon se saste dar par dollar kharidti he
 Significantly, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (bofml) brokerage firm CLSA has also advocated that India once again raise $ 30 to 35 billion by resorting to Dollar Deposit Scheme (NRI Bond) like 2013 to handle the rupee
 Can
 is kadam se jahaan rupee kii giravat par lagaam lagegaa vahiin kendra sarkaar ko apana chaalu khaataa ghaataa bhi kam karne main madad milegi
 Why the falling rupee? The ongoing trade war between the US and China and the increasing confidence of the people globally on the dollar are being cited as the biggest reasons for this decline of the rupee
 vaishvik str par is trade war ke chalate lagaataar dollar main duniya kaa bharosa bad rahaa he or dollar kii jamkar kharidari kaa ja rahi he
 At the same time, currencies of emerging markets have suffered worldwide
 nae pakistan ko samaj aayaa china kaa CPEC daanv, kya karenge imran?jaankaron kaa yah bhi kahana he ki turki kii mudra lira main jari giravat jahaan samooche europe kii mudraon ke liye sankat bani he, vahiin europe kii mudraon main giravat se ubhartee arthvyavasthaaon ke saamne sankat chaaya hua he
 In addition, the continued rise in global crude oil prices is also posing a serious challenge to the currencies of these economies
 aam aadmi ko kya nuksaan?rupee kii vaishvik bazaar main keemat kaa sidhaa asar aam aadmi par padataa he
 In simple words, if this effect is said, then everything in the market starts getting expensive
 rupee kii keemat main giravat aam aadmi ke liye videsh main chhuttiyaan manaane, videshi car kharidne, smartphone kharidne or videsh main padhai karne ko mahangaa kar detaa he
 Due to this, inflation starts knocking in the country
 rosemara kii jarurat ke utpaada mahange hone lagate hai
 You can say that the constant weakening of the rupee against the dollar makes bread, cloth and house expensive for the common man
 vahiin rupee ke kamjor hone ke asar se aam aadmi ke liye home lone bhi mahangaa ho jaataa he
 So, it is clear that when the rupee continues to fall against the dollar, this is not the time to take a new home loan
 iske alaava kamjor rupee ke chalate desh kaa aayaat mahangaa ho jaataa he
 At a time when crude oil prices are already at peak levels, weak underpricing puts more burden on the exchequer and the government's current account deficit widens
 arabiai ke paas vikalp nahin?aam dharna he ki rupee kii chapai ke saath-saath vaishvik mudra bazaar main rupee ko trade karaane main rigerv bank kii ahm bhoomika he
 Considering the current depreciation of the rupee against the dollar, India Today Hindi editor Anshuman Tiwari says the Reserve Bank has no option left to handle the rupee move
 anshuman ne kaha ki maujuuda sthiti isliye bhi penchida he kyonki ab rigerv bank rupee ko bachaane ke liye kuch kadam uthaata bhi he to vah kaamyaab nahin hoga kyonki rupaya puri tarah se vaishvik sthiti kaa mohataaj he, jinpar hamaara yani arabiai yaa sarkaar kaa koi niyantran nahin he
 Who is responsible for the beating of the rupee? a country's currency explains the health of its economy
 aarthik jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki mudra ko sanchalit karne kii sabase badi jimmedaari us desh kii sarkaar kii hoti he
 Rajiv Dubey, editor of Business Today, on the continuing decline in the Indian rupee, says that to save the rupee from such a situation, the central government will have to increase exports in the country as well as increase FDI and FPI
 doobe ke mutabik yah kaam maujuuda sthiti main nahin balki ek lambii avadhi ke dauraan kiya jaataa he
 If there was no economic slowdown in the country, the rupee would not have been trapped in this situation against the dollar
 lihaaja, maujuuda sthiti se rupee ko nikaalane ke liye export main bada ijaphe ke saath-saath desh main bada videshi pratyaksh nivesh (epadiai) or videshi portpholio nivesh kii jarurat he
 Rajiv believes that if the government had done better work on these three front during the last few years, the rupee would not have reached the present position

 Demonetisation is going to complete one year on Wednesday
 sarkaar jahaan notebandi ke faisle ko aitihaasik bataate nahin thak rahi vahiin vipaksh ‘kaala diwas’ manaane kii taiyaari main he
 In the midst of this tug of war between the government and the opposition, it is necessary to find an answer to the question of what the country has lost and gained from demonetisation
 There is a big leap and this has strengthened the foundation of Digital India
 ye daawa bhi kiya gaya tha ki issekala dhan baahar aayega
 The people who kept the money here and there were forced to withdraw
 aakhir kitni sachai he in daavon main?pehle baat kii jaae cash les lenden kii
 National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an institution of the Reserve Bank of India, is the largest institution to monitor all types of digital payments occurring in the country
 NPCI ke aankado ke mutabik notebandi ke baad desh digital tranjection ko bahut teji se apana rahaa he
 For example, digital transactions reached Rs 1000 crore in October 2017-2018
 badhotaree kii raftaar kaa andaaj isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki pichley puure vitt varsh yani 2016 - 2017 main kul milakar itnadigital tranjectionhua tha
 It is estimated that digital transactions will increase to Rs 1800 crore by the end of the current financial year
 - digital iconomi kii disha main NPCI kaa banaaya hua UPI ( United payment Interface) bahut kargar sabit hua he
 UPI has become a favorite platform for digital payments
 bank se lekar e Wallet tak, sab UPI ko teji se apana rahe hai
 So far, 57 banks have joined it in addition to npci's own app BHIM
 - sirf beete maheene yani oktober 2017 main hi UPI se hone vaale len dein kaa ankada 7 crores 70 lakh pahunch gaya
 a month earlier, in September, only 3 crore 90 lakh people had done transactions through UPI
 isaki ek bady vajah diwaali ke dauraan logon online kharidari rahi
 So far, 7057 crore transactions have been done through UPI this year, which is 32 per cent more than last year
 - notebandi ke baad pehali baar aisa hua he jab log kam cash ke saath jeene kii aadat daal rahe hai
 At the time of demonetisation, only 88 percent of the cash was in the hands of the people, even after a year
 - log ab card kaa istemaal bhi zyada kar rahe hai
 In the last one year, card transactions have increased by 60% and the number of point of sale machines has increased by 78%
 haalanki tasviir kaek doosraa pahalu bhihai
 Among these figures that show the lofty picture of Digital India, it is also a matter of concern for the government that many of the people who were doing digital transactions because of the shortage of notes after demonetisation, again returned cash
 Also returning
 notebandi ke thik baad or ab ke aankadon ko dekhen to cashles tareeke se lene dein karne waalon kii sankhya bhi ghat gayi or lenden kii vailu bhi
 - Not only this, the truth is also hidden behind all the claims of the government that people in India have not left the temptation of cash
 desh main is samay 1,31,81,190 crores nagdi he jisase len dein ho rahaa he
 Even if we combine all the methods of digital transactions, it is less than 5 percent of the total transaction
 yani bharat main abhi bhi 95 fisadi kaam kaaj cash se hi chal rahaa he
 - 70 crore people in India have a debit card and 3 crore people have a credit card, but in reality the number of people using them is very less
 -aakhir india ke cash les iconami hone ke raste main adchan kya he? sabase bady i-wolet company petm ke vaais president kiran vaasireddy kehete hai ki bharat main logon ko cash kii aadat padi hui he, logon ko ye sabase zyada bharosemand lagata he
 It will take time to change this habit
 - tamaam jaankaron kaa ye bhi maananaa he ki cash lesh banane kii hode main achaanak itane tareekon kii baadh aa gayi he ki log uhapoh main hai
 Dozens of e-wallets, Bheem, UPI, Aadhaar Pay, Net Banking, Fifty different types of banks have their own apps, instead of making the work of people easy
 - badi sakhya main logon ke paas cashles tarika istemaal karne ke liye internet tak pahunch nahin he
 Many have debit cards but do not have a POS machine to use them
 bahut se logon ko ye istemaal karnaa nahin aata or ve cash ko sabase zyada suvidhajanak maanate hai
 In the cashless economy, the biggest fear people face is the security of their wealth
 sibar maamalon ke visheshgy pawan duggal bataate hai ki cashlesh tareeke main logon ko sabase zyada dar is baat kaa lagata he ki agar koi gadabad ho gayi to unki koi sunne vaala nahin hoga
 According to Duggal, cyber crime has increased even faster than the number of cashless transactions after demonetisation
 wo kehete hai ki bina suraksha kaa pukhta intjaam kiye or jaruri infranctrecchar ke cashles iconomi ke bare main sochna badi bhul he
 Duggal says that once something goes wrong with a digital transaction, people wander around to get their money back, but they have no one to listen to
 i-wolet se lekar bhim, upiai or bahut se bainkon ke helpline kii sarvice behad kharaab he
 - It takes a lot of time to settle the complaints of the people on the Bhima app from the Government of India itself and the complaints are not responded to in time
 aise main sarkaar ne maujuuda vitt varsh main 2500 crores digital tranjection kaa jo lakshya rakhaa he wo naammumkin dikhataa he
 As far as black money is being taken from demonetisation, the Reserve Bank of India itself has said that almost all the money that people had at the time of demonetisation has returned to all banks
 vipaksh kaa aarope he ki iskaa matlab ye hua ki notebandi se koi kaala dhan nahin aayaa
 At the same time, the government argues that black money does not become white just by depositing it in the bank, and black money will be exposed by checking the money deposited in the bank
 ye prakriya abhi bhi chal rahi he isliye notebandi kaa kaala dhan par asar ke bare main abhi saaf taur par kuch kahana jaldbaaji hogi
 However, one advantage is clear that the number of those filing tax returns has increased directly by 25 per cent
 notebandi ke baad 2 karod 79 lakh logon ne inakam tex ritern file kiya jo pichley saal ke mukaable 56 lakh zyada he
 Political parties have started exploring alliances here and there as soon as the Lok Sabha elections begin
 isi ke tahat congress tamilnadu or pudducheri main vijayakaanth kii party deshiy murpokku dravid kadgam (dmdike) ke saath gathbandhan kii baat kerani shuru kar di he
 According to information received from sources, the Congress has started talking about an alliance with Vijayakanth's party
 or yadi ye baatcheet safal rahati he to phir ye gathbandhan diemke se baat karegaa
 If sources are to be believed, Congress, MDMK and DMK, VCK and Muslim Party will contest on 20 seats
 baharhaal faisla hona abhi baaki he
 Negotiations between political parties are still going on
 gauratlab he ki tamilnadu kii 39 loksabhaa siton ke liye chunaav 24 april ko ek charan main sampann hoga
 Lok Sabha elections will also be held for a seat in Puducherry on the same day (april 24)
 nirvachan ayog ke mutabik chunaav adhisuchana 29 march ko jari kii jaaegi
 The last date for nomination of candidates for the election is five April and the last date for withdrawal of nominations is 9 April
 maton kii ginati 16 may ko kii jaaegi
 The by-elections in Alandur assembly constituency of Tamil Nadu will also be held on 24 April
 panaruti es
 By-elections are being held in Alandur due to Ramachandran's resignation from the native Murpokku Dravidar Kazhagam (DMDK) and assembly membership
 ramchandran baad main sattarudh ol india anna dravid munetra kadgam (ediemke) main shaamil ho gaye the
 It will be interesting to see if AIADMK gives Ramachandran a ticket for the Alandur seat

 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee today dismissed Narendra Modi's allegation that he (mamata) has done more damage to the state during her 35-month rule than the Left Front's 35-year term
 iske saath hi mamata ne kaha ki vikaas ko lekar unhen modi se 'gyaan' lene kii jarurat nahin he
 Mamata, the Trinamool Congress chief, wrote on Twitter, 'if he comes to power, India will sink into darkness
 hamen dangon ke architect se vikaas par gyaan kii jarurat nahin he
 Speaking on the bjp's sharp attack on the Prime Ministerial candidate, Mamta said, "if the person who is being projected as the Prime Minister candidate, India will be ruined if he comes to power
" ' Allegations made by Modi that he is involved in vote bank politics by ignoring non-bangladeshi people and welcoming Bangladeshis, Mamata told reporters that she (modi) is not aware of history
 unhone kaha ki bangladesh se pravasi 1971 ke indira-mujeeb samjhaute ke tahat bharat aae
 He said, 'mr
 Modi does not know history
 unhen nahin maaloom ki bangla bolne se koi bangladeshi nahin ho jaataa
 ' mamata ne kaha, 'bharat main duusari jagah, jo bhi bangla bolta he, use bangladeshi kah diya jaataa he
 This is discrimination
 ' unhone modi par vibhaajankaree raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha, 'shri modi bengaaliyon or gaiyr bengaaliyon ko baantnaa chaahate hai
 It is condemnable
 ' Mamta said, 'mr
 Modi wants to send Bengalis from India
 vah tay karne vaale koun hote hai? vah vibhaajankaree raajnneeti main shaamil hai
 He wanted to divide Darjeeling
 ab vah rajya main hindu or musalamaanon ko baantnaa chaahate hai
 'he said,' Bangla is the fifth most spoken language in the world
 kisi bhashaa ke khilaaf ghrinaa failaana aparaadh he
 The people of Bengal live with the harmony
 
 
 ' Attacking the Gujarat model of development, Mamta said, 'gujarat's growth has declined during her reign
 ' is kram main kai aankade dete hue mamata ne kaha ki bengal main rajasav aay main 31 pratishat kii dar se vruddhi huyi lekin gujarat main yah sirf 15 pratishat rahi
 Earlier in the press conference held in Kolkata on Monday, TMC leaders attacked Modi fiercely
 unhone kaha ki rajnatik shaleenta bhul kar narendra modi nijee hamale kar rahe hai
 The party said on Modi's charge that prove the allegation against Mamta's paintings otherwise face defamation
 party kaa kahana he ki modi ahamkaari hai or ve jhuthe aarope laga rahe hai
 Whose own hands are stained with blood, he is making personal attacks on Mamta
 (padhe- 'modi ke haath 'khun se range hai') Nowadays politics has become so dominant in cricket that it seems that politicians, not cricketers, should play cricket
 cricket ko chalaane vaale cricketer nahin, zyada se zyada rajaneta hai
 Many State Cricket Association presidents are also politicians
 kahin aisa samay na aa jaae ki cricket team main bhi rajanetaaon ke liye jagah reserve rakhni pade? The way the Shiv Sainiks have been connecting cricket with politics for the last few years is also a matter of concern
 pehle pakistan kii team ko mumbai main khilne se roak rahe the, ab to pakistan ke ampire aleem daar ko dhamkee di gai he ki vah bharat-dakshin africa match main ampiring na karen
 Because of this, the ICC has removed him from umpiring in this match
 mumbai main hone vaali pakistan cricket board or bisisiai kii meeting bhi shivasainikon kii vajah se radd kerani padi
 Shiv Sainiks may also issue a decree that no player from Maharashtra should play a match against Pakistan team, then do not watch any match between Pakistan and India from the audience of Maharashtra
 kya deshbhakti kaa matlab yahi he ki ham cricket ko raajnneeti kii chashme se dekhen or raajnneeti karen? kya aisa karne se hamaari deshbhakti bad jaati he? yah pehali baar nahin he ki shivasainik aisi harakat kar rahe hai
 In 1991, due to Shiv Sainiks, the Test match between India and Pakistan in Mumbai had to be canceled, in 1999 the Shiv Sainiks also dug up the pitch of Firoz Shah Stadium in Delhi
 shivasainikon ke virodh ke vajah se kisi bhi pakistani khilaadi ko ipel main jagah nahin mili
 There have been many cases due to which cricket matches between India and Pakistan have to be canceled
 bharat or pakistan ke bich cricket rishta kaaphi purana he
 After independence many matches have been played between the two countries
 cricket ko raajnneeti se hameshaa dur rakhane kii koshish kii gai he
 Three Test matches have also been played between the two countries in Mumbai
 azaadi ke baad pehali baar pakistan team ne oktober 1952 main bharat kaa daura kiya tha or paanch test match khele the
 One of these matches was also played in Mumbai in which India won
 phir 1955 main bharat ne pakistan kaa daura kiya or paanch test match khele
 The comments donon deshon ke bich yah silsilaa farvari 1961 tak chalata rahaa
 Due to stress, no Test match was played from 1961 to 1977
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki shaayad donon deshon ke bich cricket kaa rishta khatm ho gaya, lekin atal bihari vaajapeyi kii koshish se 1978 main bhartiya team ne pakistan kaa daura kiya or teen test match khele
 Vajpayee was then foreign minister in Morarji Desai's government
 phir agle saal pakistan team ne bharat kii daura kiya or chah test match khele
 One of these matches was also played in Mumbai and India won it by 131 runs
 itnaa hi nahin, 1999 kii kargil ladaai ke baad bharat or pakistan ke bich cricket rishta lagbhag khatm ho gaya tha
 Then due to the efforts of Atal Bihari Bajpai government, the Indian team visited Pakistan and won the three-test series 2–1
 kya virodh karne se pakistan sudhar jaayegaa or seemaa paar aatankwaad band kar degaa? agar aisa hota to ab tak seemaa paar aatankwaad band ho gaya hota
 India has done everything possible to keep politics away from cricket
 cricket ke jariye donon deshon ko kareeb laayaa ja saktaa he
 It has been seen many times that when the two countries were not ready to negotiate due to tensions, cricket was celebrated for negotiation using it as a weapon
 cricket ko raajnneeti ke chashme se nahin balki raajnneeti ko cricket ke chashme se dekhnaa chahie
 The way the Shiv Sainiks have been connecting cricket with politics for the last few years is also a matter of concern
 pehle pakistan kii team ko mumbai main khilne se roak rahe the, ab to pakistan ke ampire aleem daar ko dhamkee di gai he ki vah bharat-dakshin africa match main ampiring na karen

 Then due to the efforts of Atal Bihari Bajpai government, the Indian team visited Pakistan and won the three-test series 2–1
 kya virodh karne se pakistan sudhar jaayegaa or seemaa paar aatankwaad band kar degaa? agar aisa hota to ab tak seemaa paar aatankwaad band ho gaya hota
 India has done everything possible to keep politics away from cricket
 cricket ke jariye donon deshon ko kareeb laayaa ja saktaa he
 It has been seen many times that when the two countries were not ready to negotiate due to tensions, cricket was celebrated for negotiation using it as a weapon
 cricket ko raajnneeti ke chashme se nahin balki raajnneeti ko cricket ke chashme se dekhnaa chahie
 Does patriotism mean that we should see cricket through the prism of politics and do politics? Does doing so increase our patriotism? This is not the first time that Shiv Sainiks are doing such an act
 varsh 1991 main shivasainikon kii vajah se bharat or pakistan ke bich mumbai main hone vaala test match radd karnaa padaa tha, 1999 main shivasainikon ne dilli ke firoz shah stadium kii pich ko bhi khod daalaa tha
 No Pakistani player got a place in the IPL due to the opposition of Shiv Sainiks
 aise kai maamle saamne aae hai jinaki vajah se bharat or pakistan ke bich cricket match radd karnaa padaa he
 The cricketing relationship between India and Pakistan is very old
 azaadi ke baad donon deshon ke bich kai match khele gaye hai
 There has always been an attempt to keep cricket away from politics
 donon desh ke bich mumbai main bhi teen test match khele ja chuke hai
 For the first time since independence, the Pakistan team toured India in October 1952 and played five Test matches
 isamen se ek match mumbai main bhi khelaa gaya tha jisamen bharat ko jeet mili thi
 Then in 1955 India toured Pakistan and played five Test matches
 tippaniyan The cycle between the two countries continued till February 1961
 tanaav kii vajah se 1961 se 1977 tak koi bhi test match nahin khelaa ja sakaa tha
 It seemed that perhaps the relationship between the two countries had ended, but with the effort of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in 1978, the Indian team toured Pakistan and played three Test matches
 vaajapeyi us vaqt morarji desai kii sarkaar main videsh mantri the
 Then next year Pakistan team visited India and played six test matches
 isamen se ek match mumbai main bhi khelaa gaya tha or bharat ne ise 131 ran se jeeta tha
 Not only this, the cricketing relationship between India and Pakistan had almost ended after the 1999 Kargil War
 phir atal bihari bajpeyi sarkaar kii koshish kii vajah se bhartiya team ne pakistan kii daura kiya or teen test match kii siries 2-1 se jitkar ai
 Will the protest improve Pakistan and stop cross-border terrorism? If that were the case, cross-border terrorism would have stopped by now
 bharat ne apni taraf se harsambhav koshish kii he ki raajnneeti ko cricket se dur rakhaa jaae
 Cricket can bring the two countries closer
 kai baar dekha gaya he ki jab donon desh tanaav kii vajah se baatcheet ke liye taiyaar nahin hote the, tab cricket ko ek hathiyaar ke rup main istemaal karke baatcheet ke liye manaaya jaataa tha
 Cricket should not be viewed through the prism of politics but politics
 bharat or pakistan ke bich cricket rishta kaaphi purana he
 After independence many matches have been played between the two countries
 cricket ko raajnneeti se hameshaa dur rakhane kii koshish kii gai he
 Three Test matches have also been played between the two countries in Mumbai
 azaadi ke baad pehali baar pakistan team ne oktober 1952 main bharat kaa daura kiya tha or paanch test match khele the
 One of these matches was also played in Mumbai in which India won
 phir 1955 main bharat ne pakistan kaa daura kiya or paanch test match khele
 The comments donon deshon ke bich yah silsilaa farvari 1961 tak chalata rahaa
 Due to stress, no Test match was played from 1961 to 1977
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki shaayad donon deshon ke bich cricket kaa rishta khatm ho gaya, lekin atal bihari vaajapeyi kii koshish se 1978 main bhartiya team ne pakistan kaa daura kiya or teen test match khele

 com / W9ENFGPJ2S— Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian)january 2, 2015- input IANS Pakistan has accepted India's request to allow PM Narendra Modi's aircraft to pass through its air specials
 ek pakistani adhikari ne bataaya ki imran khan sarkaar ne bishkek jane ke liye pradhanmantri modi ke vimaan ko pakistan ke hawaii kshetra se guzarane kii anumati dene ke bharat sarkaar ke anurodh ko saidhantik rup se sweekaar kar liya he
 The official said that after the formalities are completed, the Government of India will be made aware of the decision
 nagar vimaanan praadhikaran ko bhi nirdesh diya jayega ki vah airmen ko suchit kar de
 He also said that Pakistan hopes that India will accept its offer to hold peace talks
 bataa den kibharat ne pakistan se kirgistan ke bishkek jane ke liye pradhanmantrinarendra modi (PM Modi)ke vimaan ko apane vaayu kshetra se guzarane dene kaa anurodh kiya tha
 PM Modi is scheduled to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit on 13 June and 14 June in Bishkek
 pakistan ne balakot main jaish-e-mohammad ke aatankwaadi shivi par bhartiya vaayu sena ke hamale ke baad 26 farvari ko apana vaayu kshetra puri tarah band kar diya tha
 Since then it has opened only two airways out of a total of 11 and both pass through South Pakistan
 ek varisht sarkari adhikari ne kaha tha ki hamane pakistan se pradhanmantri ke vimaan ko apane ek maarg se hokar guzarane dene kaa anurodh kiya he jo abhi tak khulaa nahin he
 The Prime Minister is scheduled to attend the SCO summit on 13 June and 14 June
 pakistan ne 21 may ko bharat kii tatkaaleen videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ko kirgistan ke bishkek main essio videsh mantriyon kii baithak main shaamil hone ke liye pakistani vaayu kshetra se sidhe udaan bharne kii khaas anumati di thi
 Apart from two routes in South Pakistan, the airspace of the neighboring country is still closed for commercial aircraft
 bhartiya vaayu sena ne 31 may ko ghoshnaa kii thi ki balakot hawaii hamale ke baad bhartiya vaayu kshetra par lagaae sabhi asthaayee pratibandh hataa liye gaye hai
 However, it is unlikely to benefit any commercial airline until Pakistan opens its airspace
 pakistani vaayu kshetra ke band hone se air india or indigo kii antarrashtriya udaanen prabhavit hai

 ’ Sangh Pramukh Mohan Bhagwat's statement about the lion and the dog has created a ruckus at the World Hindu Congress in America
 AIMIM ke pramusaduddin ovaisior bharip bahujan mahasang ke netaa prakaash ambedkar ne bhagwat ke is bayaan par kadi aapatti jataai he
 Owaisi and Ambedkar have alleged that in this statement of Bhagwat, the lion refers to the Sangh and the dog to opposition parties
 ovaisi ne kaha ki bharat ke samvidhan main sabhi ko insaan ke rup main bataaya gaya he
 It does not mention anyone as a lion or a dog
 sangh ke saath yahi dikkat he
 The Union does not follow the Constitution of India
 sangh kii vichaardhaara hi aisi he
 In this, they consider themselves lions and all others as dogs
 ve khud ko shaktishaalee or dusron ko kamjor samajhate hai
 But in our constitution, all have been treated as equal
 90 saal se sangh aisi hi bhashaa bol rahiowaisi ne kaha ki ve bhagwat ke is bayaan se jaraa bhi nahin chaunke hai
 He alleged that the RSS had been using this language for the last 90 years
 desh kii janata unhen iskaa jawaab degi
 What Bhagwat said
 
 
 bhagwat ne shuukravaar ko apane sambodhan main kaha tha ki hinduon ko prabhutv kii koi aakanksha nahin he or samudaay tabhi samrudh hoga jab vah ek samaaj ke rup main kaam karegaa
 He said that 'if a lion is alone then wild dogs can attack and eliminate the lion
 hamen yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie
 Bhagwat said that we want to make the world better
 hamen prabhutv kii koi aakanksha nahin he
 Our influence is not a result of conquest or colonization
 prakaash ambedkar ne kii nindaavaheen bharip bahujan mahasang ke netaa prakaash ambedkar ne bhi america ke chicago main yojitvishwa hindu congresamen bhagwat ke bayaan kii ninda kii he
 Ambedkar, while speaking to reporters on Saturday, condemned Bhagwat's statement and claimed that the reference to 'dog' was for opposition parties in the country
 unhone kaha ki main mohan bhagwat kii is maansikta kii ninda karata hum jisamen unhone desh kii vipakshi partiyon kaa zikr kute ke rup main kiya he
 He said that the parties came to power and went but this mentality shows the thinking of the ruling party that the opposition cannot fight them
 ambedkar ne kaha ki meraa maananaa he ki unhen satta main dobaaraa laane se pehle logon ko pun: sochna chahie
 He also raised his slogan by the 'invincible BJP' at a meeting of national officials and state unit presidents in New Delhi
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa gujarat main lagbhag haar hi gaye the or karnataka main haar gaye

 (1) Learning Capacity: Whenever a company hires a fresher, first of all it sees in a student how much he wants to learn new work and how soon he learns that work
 iske liye har company kaa apana-apana funda hota he jise company intervyuu ke dauraan candidet main parakh leti he ki wo unke liye kitna upyogi he
 Therefore, you should be well prepared for the fact that the company will check your learning capacity
 (2) atitude:campus placement ke intervyuu ke dauraan sellection karne vaale studet ke atitude ko bhi parakhte hai
 Actually, the company wants to hire a candidate with a positive approach
 isliye company kii koshish hoti he kisi tarah ofer amount yaa kisi mushkil se sawaal ke dauraan dekhe ki aap kaise riect karte hai
 If you calm down and answer positively then your job is confirmed
 (3) company chaahati he innovative candidet:koi bhi company intervyuu ke dauraan ye dekhati he ki koun sa candidats usko zyada se zyada phayda pahunchaa sakate hai
 For this, the company also examines innovative skills in the candidate
 isliye intervyuu ke dauraan yah bhi dikhaanaa hoga ki aap kitne innovative hai or company ke liye kis tarah phydemand sabit ho sakate hai
 (4) Need of the company: Actually for every post, the company has its own requirement and the company is hiring accordingly
 isliye intervyuu ke dauraan vah aapse post kii jarurat se jude sawaal karti he
 For this preparation, it would be better to find out from the placement cell of the college, for which post the company is coming for recruitment
 aap usee ke hisaab se taiyaari karke jaaen
 (5) Avoid Salary Negotiation: All students want good job and good package
 adhiktar company kii selleri phiqasd hoti he
 Sometimes salary negotiation can spoil what you have
 iske liye aapako industry ke halaaton ko bhi samajhane kii jarurat hoti he
 Avoid hurrying to reject the offer only by making the package the basis

 These include celebrating Fatiha Dawaz Dahum (or Eid ud Milad Un Nabi) in Hazrat Muhammad's birthday in state-run libraries
 is saal 2 disambar ko ise manaaya jayega
 Each library will get a grant of Rs 1000-1000 for every program celebrated in the year by the State Library Department
 aadesh main saaf kiya gaya he ki librari is anudaan ke alaava kaarykram ke aayojan ke liye apane str par sthaneey sansadhano kii madad lenaa chahen to le sakati hai
 Let us know that in January this year, the government-aided school located in Tehatta of Howrah had to be closed indefinitely after communal tension

 Also read: Bengal: Government school closed after tensions, 2000 students' future In conversation with India Today, the principal of the school had said that those who were seeking permission to celebrate Nabi Day had raised the question that Why does the school management allow the Saraswati Puja to be organized in the school premises every year

 But Nabi Divas is not included
 bhartiya janata party samet dakshinpanthi sanghathanon ne rajya sarkaar ke faisle kii aalochana kii he
 They say that there is no precedent of celebrating Nabi Day in the state libraries, hence another step taken in the direction of minority appeasement

 Therefore, Nabi Divas and Iftar parties will be organized, but it is expected that Durga Puja and Saraswati Puja events should stop

 It is the result of this open appeasement politics that communal tension is increasing in Bengal

 This employment here has been flourishing for a long time

 It is not that these people give blessings by offering prasad and tilak in the morning and evening

 She says that in relation to the priest of a temple it can be understood that in the morning and evening after the Arti, people are distributing offerings, but today it has become a business in many other cities including Patna

 In Jodhpur, when Judge Madhusudan Sharma sentenced Asaram to life imprisonment at 2
30 pm, Asaram wept
 iske saath hi is maamle main aaropee shilpi or sharathchandra ko bees-bees saal kii saaj sunai gai
 Earlier, when the court convicted Asaram in the sexual exploitation case, he lost his face
 kuch pal shant rahakarasaramram naam japane laga tha or phir achaanak vah naatakeey andaaj main hansane laga
 After this, he also requested mercy from the judge
 phir asaram ne vakeelon ke kandhe par haath rakhkar kaha- kuch to bolo
 After this, when the judge sentenced Asaram to life imprisonment, he cried in court
 5 saal puraane yon shoshan ke maamle main asaram baapu ko jodhpur kii adaalat ne doshi qaraar de diya
 Court was put in jail for security reasons
 jaj madhusudan maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe the
 He reached the court at the appointed time in the morning and summoned the accused
 sabhi aropiyon ke aa jane ke baad jaj ne asaram ko bulaayaa
 He was not there
 adaalat kii karrwai shuru ho chuki thi, lihaaja jaj madhusudan sharma ne asaram ko laane ke liye kaha to bataaya gaya ki vah puja kar rahaa he
 Then he reached the judge after 15 minutes
 tabhi asaram ke vakil ne jaj se kaha ki ve unke saamne kuch kahana chaahate hai
 On this, Judge Sharma told the lawyer that nothing has to be heard now
 cese kii sunwaayee puri ho chuki he
 Now is the time for decision
 iske baad jaj sharma ne apane stano se kareeb do pej tip karaae
 After a while, he pronounced Asaram guilty while delivering the verdict
 asaram ke saath shilpi or sharatchand ko bhi jaj ne doshi qaraar diya
 But the judge acquitted him, citing Shiva and Prakash's young age
 faisla sunate hi asaram kaa cheharaa kaa utar gaya
 He looked very disappointed
 vah ram naam kaa jaap karne laga
 And after some time he started laughing
 isi dauraan adaalat ne aage kii karrwai shuru kar di
 Public prosecutors began to argue for severe punishment for Asaram and the sentence began to be debated
 isi bich faisla sunne ke baad asaram ne jaj se kaha ki vah boodha ho gaya he
 Have mercy on him lekin jaj ne uski baton par koi pratikriya nahin di
 An army of lawyers was present on behalf of Asaram in the special court set up in Jodhpur jail

 Now if an idolman does not sell his idols to earn more, what else will he do, but in PK he showed the man a vicious shopkeeper
 PK ke bachche nahin honge, par us murtivale ke to hai
 Two will earn more money, otherwise how will it run home? kam se kam mandir ke saamne bheekh to nahin maang rahaa he
 Eating hard
 isaki kadar to karo

 doodh bechney waalon kodoodh
 
 
 Milk
 
 
 doodh
 
 
 Can drink full glass everyday
 vaise bahuton ko mil nahin paata
 But there is no question of miserliness in the name of God
 kyonki maamla unhen khush karne kaa he
 Is to fulfill his desires
 ab PK ise dhong bataata he
 If people stop offering milk, then God will not be angry
 saath main doodhwaalon kii kamai kaa kya hoga? bechaare kamaayenge nahin to jienge kaise?7
 The potter and the artisans who make the idol are the gift of God
 isaki koi training nahin lee ja sakati
 Another object of God makes you an artist in the mother's belly
 bhagwaan kii murti bhi to kumhaar or karigar kii kalatmak vidwata kaa namoona he
 PK insults this art, asks the question that you made the idol of God
 wo bhi in haathon se
 If the potter and the artisan do not use this beautiful gift of God, then who else will make the murtis

 aapaki seva main sadaiv tatpar
 This does not mean that if anyone urinates in the restricted area, the policemen should also keep an eye on it

 hindu samaaj kocafkh dharmandhta par charchaa chahta he, acchhee baat he
 But the question is why only Hinduism and its beliefs? The film was about three hours, dividing the time equally for every religion
 hindu dharm ke bhakton kaa naaraaz hona to jaayaaj he

 dharmaguruon kojise kapade pahanane kaa salika nahin, wo batayega aasthaa ke bare main
 Already, due to the court, Baba's woes have come
 ab PK bhi peeche pad gaya
 Is there any enmity? It is said that if religious leaders can perform miracles, they should do something for the good of the poor people of the country
 to sarkaar kya karegi? desh ke har kaam kaa theka dharmaguruon ne hi le rakhaa he
 Already sharing knowledge, is it less? 11
 manushya birdarihamne duniya ko shunya diya
 We hypothesized about God's particle
 par PK ne hamase kya siikhaa
 
 
 Stealing and lying
 isse bada apmaan or kuch he kya?hamane jaanboojhkar is suchi ke liye 11 kism ke logon ko chunaa kyonki hindu dharm ke mutabik yah ank shubh he
 The voice should be such that the distant voice is heard, so the beginning should be auspicious

 In Gujarat, in the case of extension of IPS PP Pandey to Executive DGP, now Gujarat DGP PP Pandey will be immediately relieved of the post
 gujarat sarkaar unhen die gaye ekstansion ko waapas lene kaa notification jari karegi
 In view of the stand during the hearing in the Supreme Court, the Gujarat government agreed to the letter of PP Pandey to be freed immediately
 shuruyaat main gujarat sarkaar chaahati thi ki pandey ko 30 april tak pad par bane rahane diya jaae, lekin CJI khehar ne kaha ki yaa to sarkaar koi faisla le nahin to court aadesh jari karegaa
 The Gujarat government told the court that PP Pandey himself has written to the government that he wants to quit
 sarkaar chaahati thi ki vah chah maheene tak pad par rahen, lekin centre ne unhen 30 april tak hi ekstansion diya he
 Charge sheet has been filed in Ishrat case
 ve gavaahon yaa sabooton ko prabhavit nahin kar sakate isliye unhen 30 april ko ritair hone diya jaae, lekin supreme court ne kaha ki vah pehle hi ritair ho chuke hai
 This is just an extension
 1 april ko bheje letters main pandey ne likhaa he ki unke ekstansion ko supreme court main kuch asantusht logon ne bevajaah uthaaya taaki gujarat sarkaar or centre sarkaar kii badanaami ho sake
 Therefore, to stop this controversy and to save the government from embarrassment, i want to immediately be free from my post and urge the government to withdraw the notification immediately
 pichhali sunwaayee main supreme court ne gujarat sarkaar ko notice jari kar jawaab maanga tha
 The notice was issued on the petition of retired IPS officer Julio Ribeiro
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki peepi pandey ishrat jahaan samet kai cese main aaropee rahe hai, lekin sarkaar ne ritairement ke baad ekstansion dekar gujarat kaa kaaryakari DGP bana diya he
 With this, he has been in charge of investigating all the cases and has become the head of the policemen who testify in the cases
 aise main vah keson ko prabhavit karenge, isliye unako pad se hataaya jaae
 The comments pichley saal may main gujarat sarkaar ke chaar hatya ke aarope jhel rahe bhartiya police seva ke adhikari peepi pandey ko gujarat rajya kaa kaaryakari police mahanideshak banane ke khilaaf seva nivrutt adhikari julio francis ribero ne gujarat hoicourt main bhi chunauti dekar ukt niyukti ko nirast karne kii maang kii thi, haalanki gujarat hoicourt ne yachika ko khaarij kar diya tha
 The petition said that testimony was yet to be given in the Ishrat encounter case
 is sthiti main police mahanideshak jo swayan is maamle main aaropee hai
 Its effect is definitely going to affect the witnesses and subordinate officers
 ribero ne is niyukti ko nyaay hit or lokhit ke vipareet bataaya he
 In April 2016, orders were sent to Gujarat DGP PC Thakur on deputation to Delhi
 unki sevanivritti ke liye keval 7 maah kaa samay shesh tha or uske baad peepi pandey ko kaaryakari dijipi banane ke aadesh jari hue
 There was only 9 months left for Pandey's retirement
 yachika main yah bhi kaha gaya ki ishrat encounter maamle ko rafa-dfa karne or pandey ko dijipi banane ke liye sarkaar ne jaanboojhkar yah aadesh diya he
 The statements of the police officers in the CBI charge sheet, all those officers will be under Pandey's control
 isse aapraadhik prakaran par asar padana tay he
 In a letter sent on April 1, Pandey wrote that his extension was unnecessarily raised by some disgruntled people in the Supreme Court to bring the Gujarat government and the central government into disrepute
 isliye is vivaad ko viraam dene ke liye or sarkaar ko sharmindagi se bachaane ke liye main turant apane pad se mukt hona chahta hum or sarkaar se aagrah karata hum ki ve turant notification ko waapas len
 In the last hearing, the Supreme Court had issued a notice to the Government of Gujarat seeking an answer
 ritred IPS afasar julio ribero kii yachika par notice jari kiya gaya tha
 The petition said that PP Pandey has been accused in many cases including Ishrat Jahan, but the government has given the extension of Gujarat to the acting DGP after retirement
 isse tamaam keson kii jaanch ke ve prabharee ho gaye hai or keson main gavaahi dene vaale pulisavaalon ke mukhiya ho gaye hai
 In such a situation, he will affect the cases, so he should be removed from office

 Just before the MCD election, the Congress has suffered a major setback
 bijepi jwine karne ke baad lavali ne kaha ki unhone party netritv par sawaal uthaae
 Arvinder Singh Lovely said that the Congress is no longer the same
 party netritv se netaaon kii baat tak nahin hoti he, to logon se kya baat hogi
 Neither spoke to Walia saab and Mangat Ram Singhal
 menifesto kaa achaanak pataa chalaa or mujhe bulaayaa bhi nahin gaya
 Lovely also mentioned his neglect in the party
 unhone kaha ki jahaan aatm sammaan hi nahin vahaan kaise rahaa ja saktaa he
 Along with this, he said that, 'after 1984, no one joined the Sikh Party
 meri jaan ko khatra tha phir bhi party main rahaa, sikhon ko joda
 i became president at a time when no one was ready to take responsibility
 lekin party ne koi sabak nahin liya
 The leaders are saying that tickets are being sold but there is no one to listen
 'lavali ne kaha ki maine 2015 main apni seat kii qurbaani di
 He was made the chairman whose bail was also not saved
 puure desh main main akelaa adhyaksh tha jise bina vajah kaa hataaya gaya
 i did not mind, kept quiet for two years
 'congress iz ded'arvinder singh lavali ne kaha ki congress party khatm ho chuki he
 Lovely also questioned Rahul Gandhi's skill

 in logon ko khatra lage to main kya karun
 On Sheila Dixit, Anger Lovely also commented on former CM Sheila Dixit
 lavali ne kaha ki ajay maakan se score settle karne ke chakkar main wo unhen gaddaar bol raheen hai
 'happy loyalty to Sheila ji
 sahamat rahaa yaa asahmat rahaa lekin maine shila ji ke sammaan main koi kami nahin rakhi

 ' dilli main roj kii tarah us sadak par bharpoor trephic tha
 It was time of day
 paidal chalane waalon kii bhi acchhee-khaasi taadaad thi
 Then in the midst of the traffic moving on the road, suddenly some boys get down from one car and stop another car
 us car ke saath hi peeche se aa rahi baaki gaadiyaan bhi ruk jaati hai
 a PCR van was also parked on the roadside
 magar in sabase beparwaah car se utre donon ladakon ne achaanak pistal nikaali or goliyaan chalaani shuru kar di
 It is hard to believe at first glance, seeing the beach road firing
 dekhne waalon ko inke kisi filmi seen kaa hissaa hone kaa dhokhaa bhi ho saktaa he
 But in front of hundreds of eyes on the middle road, without any fear of law and law, it hurts anyone to shoot bullets, it is not only scary but also strange
 tabhi kaanpate haathon se kisi shahari ne is manzar ko apane mobile phone main shoot karne kii koshish kii, taaki kal ko jab ye tasviren saamne aaen, to kisi ke liye is vaakye par shaq karne kii koi gunjaaish naa bache
 But the truth is that whatever happens in Delhi's gang war is less
 is vaakye main to phir bhi ek-duusare ke koon ke pyaase do gangster aapas main takaraa rahe hai, lekin tarikh gavaah he ki dilli ke gangster kai baar dushmani main itani aage nikal jate hai ki wo apane dushmano ke saath-saath unke begunaah gharavaalon or naate-rishtedaaron ko bhi goliyon kaa nishaanaa banane se nahin chookte
 May 19, 2019 at 3 pm 45 baje, dwarka, dillidansal, dilli main jurm kii kaali duniya par apane varchasv kii ladaai main uljhe do gangstaron kaa ravivaar ko achaanak hi ek-duusare se aamanaa saamana ho gaya
 a gangster named Vikas Dalal had received the news that his enemy Praveen Gehlot was going to pass through this road in Dwarka area with his people
 bas! phir kya tha? vikaas ne apane gurgon ke saath bich sadak par hi praveen kaa intazaar karnaa shuru kar diya
 So that it can be killed by ambush
 or phir jaise hi praveen vahaan apni safed rang kii ritz car se pahunchaa, apni gaadi se utar kar vikaas dalal or uske gurgon ne praveen par firing shuru kar di
 But in this story, a strong twist came when the development broker himself became a victim of bullet after killing others
 or khel dekhie ki ye goli uske dushman praveen yaa uske gurgon ne apni jaan bachaane ke liye nahin chalaai, balki khud un pulisavaalon ne chalaai, jin par dilli main kaayade kaanoon ke hifaazat kii javabdehi he
 That is, there was also a gang war and encounter at the same time
 asal main yahaan khadi ek pisiar vine main maujuud pulisavaalon ne jab bich sadak par firing kii awaz suni or kuch logon ko dusron par goli chalaate hue dekha, to consteble naresh ne apni pistal se hamalaavaron par firing kar di
 His aim was unmistakable
 goli sidhe vikaas dalal ko lagi or praveen ko maarane kii koshish kar rahaa vikaas khud hi sadak par dher ho gaya
 However, despite the police action, the development operatives continued firing on Praveen and ultimately killed him
 dhyaan se dekhie kaise praveen gahalot par goliyaan barasaane ke baad jab vikaas ke logon ko uski maut kaa itmeenaan ho gaya, to unhone police kii goli se bich sadak par pade apane sargana vikaas dalal kii sud lee or use uthaa kar le jane kii koshish kii
 But by then it was late
 mauka-e-vaardaat par chand minuton ke andar ek gangvaar bhi hui or ek encounter bhi
 In which two gangsters were killed
 praveen gahalot or vikaas dalal bhi
 Now let us also make you aware of the reality of these two gangsters
 asal main vikaas dalal dilli ke kukhyat gangster manjit mahal kaa wo gurga tha, jo jail main band manjit ke ishare par jail ke baahar uske tamaam ulte-sidhe dhandhon kii zimmedaari sambhalata tha, jabaki praveen gahalot jurm kii duniya main ek alag hi khilaadi tha
 From extortion to land grabbing, taking possession of someone's property and evacuating it, a lot of work was involved in these gangsters' earning methods
 lekin har rose kaali kamai ke nae-nae hatkande apanaate ye donon gangster ek rose yun bich sadak par ek duusare kaa rasta kaat jaaenge, ye kisi ko nahin pataa tha
 Gandhian activist Anna Hazare and his supporters have decided to go on hunger strike at Mahatma Gandhi's memorial site, Raj Ghat, after the Delhi Police refused permission
 ek varisht police adhikari ne kaha ki dharna sthal jantar mantar par anshan kii anumati dene se inkaar kar diya gaya he
 For this, after the police action against Baba Ramdev at Ramlila Maidan, the prohibitory order imposed there on Sunday has been cited
 sutron ne kaha ki dilli police hazaare or unke saathiyon ko anumati nahin diye jane ke bare main pehle hi suchit kar chuki he
 The police have imposed Section 144 for 15 days in Jantar Mantar and other areas of New Delhi district after taking action against Ramdev and his supporters, who are fasting on the issue of bringing back black money abroad
 haalanki, ab hazaare ke saathi or artiai kaaryakarta arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki anna hajaare kaa anshan ab rajghat par hoga
 Hazare had announced last Sunday that he would undertake a day-long fast at Jantar Mantar on 8 June to protest against the action taken on Ramdev
