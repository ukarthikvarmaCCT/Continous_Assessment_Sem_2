 587 (via @repostapp) ・・・ Family is everything # love # holidayhome # funday a post shared by Sanjeeda Shaikh (@iamsanjeeda) on Nov 21, 2016 at 10:01pm PST The Bharatiya Janata Party on 13 September 2013 announced Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi as its prime ministerial candidate for the Lok Sabha elections to be held in april-may 2014
 is ghoshnaa ke 48 ghante baad hi party ne narendra modi ko loksabhaa chunaavon main jhonk diya or loksabhaa chunaav prachaar kii pehali raily narendra modi ne 15 sitambar ko haryana ke rewadi main kii
 Now the 2019 Lok Sabha election is knocking, the bugle of the general election is ready to be held as soon as the assembly elections in five states are over
 aam chunaavon ke liye pradhanmantri modi 4 janvari 2019 ko assam kii baraak ghati main silchar se bhartiya janata party ke chunaav prachaar kii shuruyaat kar rahe hai
 According to the fragrance in the political corridors, this time also the Lok Sabha elections will be held from april-may 2019
 lihaaja ab raajnneetik dalon ke paas janvari se may tak kaa samay prachaar ke liye bachaa he
 In such a situation, is the Bharatiya Janata Party not preparing the promotional program of Prime Minister Modi in the upcoming elections as it did before the 2014 elections
 modi sarkaar ke hai dost to aasaani se milegaa lutiuns jone main bangala!gauratlab he ki puri duniya main 2014 kaa bhartiya chunaav ek misaal he jab vipaksh main baithi party ne pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar ke taur par narendra modi ko saamne kiya or sitambar 2013 se may 2014 tak is ummidavaar ke liye puure desh main reliyaan, chunavi kaarykram, thri di reliyaan or chaay par charchaa ko milakar kul 5,827 kaarykram yojit kiye gaye
 In these 5,827 programs of 2014 election campaign, Narendra Modi addressed a total of 437 mass public meetings from Jammu and Kashmir to Kanyakumari and Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh
 inamen narendra modi ne desh ke 21 rajyon main 38 vishaal reliyaan kin
 Most of these 8 rallies were held in Uttar Pradesh
 vahiin karnataka or bihar main modi ne kramash: 4 or 3 reliyaan kin
 Significantly, with this stormy election campaign, Narendra Modi visited 25 states of the country before the general elections
 modi kii 5 badi yojanaayen jo 2019 main palat sakati hai satta kii baaji2014 ke is tufaani daure kii tulana aagaamee chunaavon se karen to pradhanmantri narendra modi ke paas ab 4 janvari 2019 se lekar may 2019 ke pehle hafte tak kaa samay bachaa he
 In this time, apart from the session of Parliament, the special session of the budget, there are many occasions when it is difficult for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to campaign
 aise main kya bhartiya janata party aagaamee chunaavon main prachaar ke liye pradhanmantri modi kaa istemaal purv chunaav kii tarah nahin karne ja rahi he? After the accident of overflowing on the mumbai-goa highway in Maharashtra, Congress MP from Maharashtra Hussain Dalwai said that many times he had written letters to the Congress and BJP government about the bridge which is flowing and had also threatened the accident there
 unhone bataaya ki patr likhakar is haive ko thik kiye jane kii maang bhi kii thi
 Dalwai says that he did not ask about this bridge, which was victim of mumbai-goa highway accident, but asked for the repair of the road many times
 unhone bataaya ki haive par sadak gaddhon ke kaaran puri tarah kharaab ho gai thi jise lekar unhone kai baar sarkaar ko chetayachittheelikhakar chetaya tha
 Dalwai said that due to road damage on the highway, there is a risk of accident
 lekin baar-baar chitthee likhane ke baad bhi naa congress kii sarkaar ne kuch kiya naa hi bijepi sarkaar ne isapar dhyaan diya
 Dalwai has attributed the incident of PWD to the accident on this bridge built in the British period

 Often the girls go to their rooms by pretending to sleep early
 par sone ke liye nahin, doston se phone par baat karne ke liye
 In such a situation, when the mother comes to close the door at night and you are caught talking on mobile, then you have no other option but to bow your head
 3
 Sometimes you make some plans that you shy away from sharing with your family
 jaise doston ke saath pikchar dekhne jane kaa plan
 But many times this lie becomes expensive and someone at home catches you buying tickets
 ese main sharmindagi se nazren jhukaane ke sivaa kya koi doosraa vikalp hota he?4
 Many times it happens that after talking to someone on the phone, you hang up the phone
 uske baad bahut der tak usee insaan ke bare main baat karte rahete hai
 After some time you come to know that the phone was not disconnected and he was listening to all the things
 5
 We often refuse to go out with our friends as an excuse for illness

 6
 kabhi-kabhi aap offis kii kisi meeting main der se pahunchate hai or aise main sabhi kii nigahen aap par tik jaati hai or log aapako tab tak ghoorte hai jab tak kii aap baith na jaaen

 kya aapke saath bhi kabhi aisa hua he ki saalon baad aapako aapkaa koi dost mili
 You meet him warmly but despite millions of attempts, you cannot remember his name? 8

 India has directly blamed Pakistan for the Uri attack in Jammu and Kashmir and the government has decided to try to isolate Pakistan internationally
 is hamale main 18 jawan shahid hue jise lekar bharat kii janata main aakrosh he or kai saarvajanik charchaaon main padosi desh ke khilaaf yuddh chhedane kii baat bhi kahi ja rahi he
 However, according to experts, India should not take any decision in a hurry and properly assess all the merits and demerits associated with the war
 yuddh se judi inhen charchaaon main 1999 main ladaa gaya kargil yuddh bhi dobaaraa yaad kiya ja rahaa he jo ki bharat-pakistan sena ke bich laddakh ke kargil main ladaa gaya tha
 Read some important information related to the same - 1999 kii garmiyon main kargil main pakistani sena ke javaanon ne thand ke dinon main bhartiya sena dwaara kuch samay ke liye chodi gai post par chupake se kabja kar liya tha
 This was done in violation of the agreement on Line of Control
 bataa den ki kargil par thand bad jane ke dauraan sena ke jawan us post ko khaali kar dete hai
 However, unlike the entire war between India and Pakistan in 1971, the border clash was more in the Battle of Kargil
 pakistan sena ne bharat ke taraf kii niyantran rekha ko paar karke kargil sector main ghuspaith kar lee thi jiskaa safaya karne ke liye bharat ne 'oparation vijay' shuru kiya tha
 The point to be noted here is that this war happened despite the signing of the Simla Treaty, which said that there would be no confrontation and infiltration on the border between the two countries
 haalanki shuruuaat main pakistan aisi kisi bhi ghuspaith se inkaar karata rahaa or bayaan diya gaya ki yah indian mujahiddeen kaa kaam he

 antarrashtriya dabaav or bharat kii ore se kii gai baari golabari ke baad aakhirkaar pakistani sena ko bhartiya post khaali kerani padi
 In this entire action, Pakistan claims that more than 3000 people died on their behalf

 Here India won in this whole operation but more than 500 soldiers were martyred
 kareeb do maheene tak chale is yuddh main bhartiya sena ke kareeb 550 jawan shahid hue the
 The fight started on 8 May 1999 and ended on 14 July but the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Bajpai declared the Kargil victory on 26 July

 In the summer of 1999, Pakistani army personnel in Kargil secretly captured the post left briefly by the Indian Army on cold days

 However, Pakistan initially denied any such intrusion and a statement was made that it was the work of the Indian Mujahideen

 com / ewe3efnm6w is filmi friday relies hui he 'pink'
 Pink is directed by Anirudh Roy Chaudhary and produced by Rashmi Sharma and Shoojit Sarkar who have directed films such as Vicky 'donner', 'madras Cafe' and 'piku'
 film kii kahani or screenple likhaa he ritesh shah ne or parde par kirdaaron ko jeevant karte najar aaenge amitabh bachchan, taapasi pannu, kirti kulhari or andre tairang
 'pink' means the pink color which is seen by connecting with women and the story of 'pink' revolves around the social difficulties of working women
 aisi mahilaayein jinke pahanaave, rahane ke dhang or baat karne ke andaaj se kuch log unke charitra ko maapte hai
 This story is about three such room mates, with whom one night something happens that causes a storm in their life
 'pink' kii khaas baat he ki bina drama or dialog ke overdoj ke vishay ke saath eemaandaar kii gai he or samaaj kii mahilaon ke prati soch bahut khubsuurati se bayaan kii gai he
 It was interesting to see how Amitabh Bachchan comes into the life of these girls in the role of a lawyer and how he defeats those who throw mud on his honor and honor in a full court with his arguments and philosophy
 samaaj kii soch par chutki lete inke seens dekhakar nirdeshak or lekhak ke naam taaliyaan bajaane ke liye apane aap haath upar uth jate hai
 In 'pink', Taapsee, Kirti and Andre give their characters a great color
 amitabh ek baar phir darshakon ko nishabd karenge
 In his film career, it appeared as a memorable performance
 piyush mishra ne bhi apane abhinay kii chhap chodi he
 The comments yun to hindi filmon main aap jajon ko order-order bolte sunate hai par film main dhritiman chatarji ne kam shabdon or kamaal ke haav-bhav se apane seens ko bakhubi nibhaayaa he
 This film may seem a bit slow to those people who are expecting only entertainment and spicy scenes from this film
 par ye bataa duun ki ye film na sirf darshakon ko pakade rakhegi balki samaaj ko aaina bhi dikhaaegi
 The songs of the film are good, especially the last in the voice of Amitabh Bachchan, which emphasizes female empowerment
 is film ko meri ore se 3
 5 stars 'pink' yani gulabi rang jise mahilaon se jodakar dekha jaataa he or 'pink' kii kahani kaamkaaji mahilaon kii saamaajik mushkilon ke ird gird gumti he
 Women whose dress, way of living and manner of talking, some people measure their character
 ye kahani aisi hi teen room mets kii hai jinke saath ek raat kuch aisa hota he jisase unki jindagi main tufaan aa jaataa he
 The special thing about 'pink' is that it has been honest with the theme of overdose without drama and dialogue and the thinking towards the women of the society has been beautifully described
 vakil ke kirdaar main amitabh bachchan in ladakiyon kii jindagi main aate hai or bhari adaalat main kis tarah se unke maan sammaan par keechad oochhaalane waalon ko apane tark or falsafon se maat dete hai ye dekhnaa dilachasp rahaa
 Seeing their scenes in society's quips, the director and the writer raise their hands to clap their names
 'pink' main taapasi, kirti or andre ne apane kirdaaron ko behtareen rang diya he
 Amitabh will once again target the audience
 unke filmi kariyar main ye ek yaadgaar parformens ke taur par najar aayaa
 Piyush Mishra has also left a mark of his acting
 tippaniyan Although in Hindi films you listen to judges speak orderly, but in the film, Dhritiman Chatterjee has played his scenes well with less words and amazing gestures
 ye film un longon ko jaraa dhimi lag sakati he jinhen is film se sirf manoranjan or masaaledaar seens kii ummid he
 But let me tell you that this film will not only hold the audience but will also show mirror to the society
 film ke gane achche hai khaastaur se aakhri main amitabh bachchan kii aawaaj main kavita, jo mahila shashaktikaran ko jor detii he
 This film was from my side 3
 5 stars

 The Maharashtra government has said that the trustees cannot prevent women from entering the Haji Ali Dargah
 darasal, bombai hai court ek yachika par sunwaayee kar rahaa he, jisamen mahilaon ke dargah ke garbhagrih mempravesh par rokko chunauti di gai he
 In response to this, the state government presented its stand in the court
 dharm kii apane hisaab se vyakhya kaa haq nahinmaharashtra sarkaar kii ore se pesh hue edwocket general ne kaha ki trustee or dargah kii cameti bhale hi iske prashaasak hon, par ve dharm kii apane hisaab se vyakhya kar uskaa niyaman nahin kar sakate
 The court had earlier asked the trustees of the dargah to reconsider the rule that prohibits the entry of women
 mahilaon par pabandi ke paksh main kya kehete hai trustee?isse pehle hui sunwaayee ke dauraan dargah ke trustee kii ore se kaha gaya tha ki kisi purush muslim sant kii kabr par mahilaon kaa janaa islam main gunaah he
 Therefore, the entry of women into the sanctum sanctorum is right
 hoicourt ko supreme court ke faisle kaa intjaar18 janvari ko bombai hai court ne kaha tha vahasupreme court ke faisle kaa intjarkaregaa
 The Supreme Court is going to give a verdict on the entry of women in Kerala's Kesabarimalandamir
 iske baad hi dargah main mahilaon ke pravesh par koi faisla hoga
 The High Court says that both the cases are religious and hence the decision of the Supreme Court of the country is awaited
 rajasthan ke bhavi upmukhyamantri or congress netaa sachin payalat ne rajya main hone vaale mukhyamantri ke rup main ek yuva 'ashok gahalot' ko badhai de daali
 While he was to congratulate senior Congress leader Ashok Gehlot
 asal main twitor par kisi ko tag karte vakt maamuli si chook se massej kisi or vyakti tak pahunch saktaa he! sachin payalat ke saath bhi hua yaheen jab unhone ashokgehlot ko tag karne kii koshish kii to jodhpur kaa rahane vaala ek yuva twit main tag ho gaya
 Because actually the Twitter handle of CM from Rajasthan is @ ashokgehlot51, not @ashokgehlot
 haalanki, payalat ne twit ke ghanton baad bhi isamen sudhaar nahin kiya
 He tweeted- 'thank you to Congress President @rahulgandhi ji for giving the opportunity to serve Rajasthan as Deputy Chief Minister and congratulations to Rajasthan Chief Minister @ashokgehlot ji
 main rajasthan kii janata ko aashwaasan detaa hum ki chunaav ke dauraan kiye gaye vaadon ko puri eemaandaaree se nibhaane kii koshish karunga
 After this, many users also tweeted in response to the tagged wrong Gehlot
 @bj_boy1996 ne likhaa- sahab pehle asli ashok ji ko to tag karo, lagata he naaraaz chal rahe ho
 
 
 @ narpat_roman619 wrote- Sir g ye konse Ashok Gehlot to tag kar diye ho
 mukhyamantri nahin banane kaa itnaa kya gam hai
 
 
 There was a contest for the post of CM, tell you that after defeating the BJP in Rajasthan, there was a contest between Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot for the post of Chief Minister in the Congress Party
 lambii rassakassi ke baad congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne gahalot ko siem ke rup main chunaa, jabaki payalat ko dipti siem kaa pad diya gaya
 The Congress won 99 seats in Rajasthan, while the BJP had to settle for 73 seats
 iske alaava bispi ko 6, communist party of india (marxsist) ko 2, bhartiya trybal party ko 2, rashtriya lok dal ko ek, rashtriya loktantric party ko 3 or nirdaleeyon ko 13 siton par jeet mili
 Today is the death anniversary of the country's famous scientist Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose
 saal 1937 main 23 november ko unka nidhan ho gaya tha
 Indian scientist Professor Jagdish Chandra Bose was rich in versatility and is known as the father of invention of radio and microwave optics
 unhone hi sabit kar dikhaaya tha ki ped-paudhon main bhi jivan hota he
 The world knows him as JC Bose
 vah aise samay par kaary kar rahe the jab desh main vigyaan shodh kaary lagbhag nahin ke baraabar tha
 In such circumstances, Bose, rich in versatility, made a fundamental contribution in the field of science
 400 saal purana he kedarnath mandir kaa itihaas, khaas pattharon se hua nirmanjane jagadish chandra bose ke jivan ke bare main
 
 
 - J
 si
 Bose was born on 30 November 1858 in Rarauli village of Memansingh (now in Bangladesh)
 unhone apni praarambhik shiksha gaanv ke ek skool se shuru kii thi jise unke pita ne sthapit kiya tha
 - It is said that his father could easily send his son to a local English school, but he wanted his son to learn the mother tongue and learn about his culture before learning the English language
 bharat kaa ye vitt mantri bana tha pakistan kaa pehla pradhanmantri- saal 1884 main bose ne natural science main duusari shrenee main kala snaatak kii or landan uniwarsity se vigyaan snaatak kii degree bhi praapt kii
 He is also credited with inventing the cascograph
 iske jariye vibhinn uttejnaaon ko mapa ja saktaa tha- paudhon main jivan sabit karne kaa ye prayog landan kii royal socity main hua or duniya bose kaa loha maan gai
 - The root of a plant added to bromide
 paudhe kii dhadkan screen par ek chinh ke rup main dikh rahi thi
 Which was viewed through the instrument
 kuch der baad hi ye aniyamit hone lagi
 The world's most beautiful woman dominated the Google Doodle - a short time later, the sign showing the life of the plant began to tremble and stopped suddenly indicating that the plant had died
 - unhen bengali science fiction kii pitamah bhi kaha jaataa he
 - It is claimed that he invented wireless radio but Marconi took credit for it
 upi kii purv mukhya mantri sushri mayawati ne aakhirkaar loksabhaa chunaav kii ranbheri baja di he
 So far, she could not decide whether to support the hand or not
 lekin ab us udhedbun se nikalakar ab unhone akele chunaav ladane kaa iraadaa jataa diya he
 He made this point clear by uttering bitter words against the Congress
 lekin unka mukhya nishaanaa sapa or bijepi hi hai
 Mayawati chose to go near her loved ones instead of performing any ceremony on her 58th birthday
 unhone dilli ke anubhav se siikhaa ki saadagi or sidhi baatcheet ke jariye arvind kejariwal ne kaise apana prabhaav jamaaya
 She no longer wants to repeat the mistake she made in the previous Legislative Assembly to recognize the call of the times
 mayawati koi dhurandhar vaktaa nahin hai or na hi ishaaron-ishaaron main baat karti hai
 They have their fans and their supporters who keep everything in their heart
 isliye mayawati ne koi nai baat kehane kii bajaay bijepi or sapa ko pramukh nishaanaa banaaya
 He is also worried about the increasing influence of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and hence he lashed out at him
 bijepi se puraane gile-shikavon kii baaten uthaakar unhone saaf kar diya ki vah use sabase bada pratidwandvi maanati hai
 The danger to them from this party is that the impossibility with which they had done social engineering is coming to an end and the Brahmins are moving away from them and leaning towards BJP
 yah unke liye na keval is samay ke liye balki aage ke liye bhi chintaa kaa vishay he kyonki sirf dalit voton ke boote vah vishalkay uttar pradesh kii satta par kabiz nahin ho saktin
 Mayawati has started the election campaign but she has spent a lot of time in it
 anya partiyaan khaskar bijepi ab kaaphi aage nikal gai he
 Narendra Modi knows that this time the route to the Red Fort will go through Uttar Pradesh and hence he has made his special aide Amit Shah in charge of the place
 is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main mayawati ko kaaphi kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa padega kyonki unke kai kshatrap unhen yaa to chhod gaye hai yaa unhone hi unka patta saaf kar diya
 They do not even have active workers in many areas
 lekin jo mayawati ko jaanate hai ve yah bhi jaanate hai ki vah apane dam par chunaav ladati hai
 They do not need anyone to support
 lekin is baar kaa chunaav kuch alag he
 The issues are different and the biggest thing is that they will have to deal with many rivals
 baharhaal yah to vakt hi batayega ki mayawati aane vaale chunaav main kya jalawaa dikhaaengi lekin itnaa jarur he ki unhone shuruyaat karne main der kar di he

 'kanhaiyaane Modi government also questioned the public advertising, media programs' Mann Ki Baat' and 'public money wasted on television propaganda'
 kanhaiyane kaha, 'sabase pehle unki apni maa thim, uske baad gau mata aa gayi or ab bharat mata hai
 They want to decide what people should eat, which festival to celebrate and what clothes to wear? Who gave you this right? ' He said, stop giving 'jumle' (false promises) to the public

 nyaayalay ne kaha ki is vyavastha se vah santusht nahin he or isamen sudhaar kii aavashyaktaa he
 The court made this remark during the hearing of the case related to the ongoing legal battle for the protection of the daughter
 is maamle main maa kaa aarope he ki uskaa pati bacchee ko jabaran chin le gaya he
 Expressing displeasure over the situation, the court said that the girl should be presented on Monday
 is bich, nyaayalay ne bacchee ke sangrakshan ke vivaad ko hal karne ke liye sheersh adaalat kii do mahila vakeelon madhavi dewan or ve mohana ko madhyasth niyukt kiya he
 The court said that the two lawyers will sit with the little girl and talk to her and they are free to take this girl anywhere with them to reach any conclusion

 Shooting at Mud for the new Manyavar campaign
 Apologies! https: / / t
 co / oa7ihtbysrpromise to NOT wear a Sabya on my wedding / birth day if you were to sign me as your brand ambassador @manyavar_ ;-) Many times it happens that the color that we apply to the hair deteriorates over time and we want it to be cleaned quickly so that others can apply a new color
 par baalo se color hataanaa ek mushkil kaam he
 People usually use bleach to remove color from the hair, but using bleach can prove to be dangerous
 kam logon ko hi pataa hoga ki baalo se color saaf karne kaa sabase acha tarika he baking sodaka istemaal karnaa
 It is best to use mild lukewarm water to wash hair
 saath hi baking soda ke istemaal se bal thode ruukhe ho jate hai isliye condishnar kaa istemaal jarur karen
 However, this remedy is not for permanent color
 baking soda se baalo ko saaf karne ke liye sabase pehle baalo ko kisi achche anti dendraf shampoo se saaf kar len
 After that, mix the same amount of shampoo and baking soda
 is mishran ko kuch der tak baalo main aise hi lagaakar chhod dijie, uske baad halke gunagune pani se baalo ko saaf kar lijie
 After that clean the hair thoroughly using a conditioner
 agar ekbar ke istemaal se baalo kaa rang nahin ja rahaa to aap do se teen baar is upaay ko kar sakate hai
 India and Pakistan are known for their everlasting rivalry on the cricket field
 jab cricket kii baat ho tab bharat-paak cricket kii charchaa na ho, yah sambhav nahin he
 Even then, when their first match in the 2015 World Cup is to be played against each other
 aise mensalam cricketconklev ke dauraan isi mudde par charchaa ke liye ek seshan rakhaa gaya ‘bharat banaam pakistan’
 In this session Kapil Dev, Sunil Gavaskar, Ajay Jadeja, inzamam-ul-haq and Aamir Sohail were present on the stage
 kya ek baar phir world cap main bharat pakistan se jeet jayega? 2015 world cap main bharat-paak muqabla koun jitegaa? yah abhi se cricket ke chaahane waalon ke jehan main aane laga he or cricket ke diggaj bhi isse achoote nahin hai
 While Ajay Jadeja, like a common Indian, is still assuming that India is not thinking that his team is better and they will win the match, Gavaskar said that Pakistan does not have any special team right now
 udhar injamaam kaa kahana he ki bhartiya team behatar he or donon tiimon main sabase bada antar dhoni he
 Cricket is said to be a team game but Aamir Sohail does not seem to agree and believes that Pakistani bowler Mohammad Irfan is the player who can change the match and win the match from India in one stroke
 isse pehle charchaa kii shuruyaat hui bharat-pakistan ke bich match main hai pressure kii baat se
 Sunil Gavaskar said that the biggest cause of pressure in the match between India and Pakistan is the population, which is in both these countries
 injamaam ne kaha, ‘ham sharajah main khel rahe the
 Before the match, Jadeja told me that your public is not used to losing in Sharjah, but our public is
 tab maine kaha ki world cap main ulta he vahaan bhartiya team jitati he
 Ajay Jadejane said, 'overall this is the game where the pressure goes on
 bharat-pakistan ke bich bhashaaen samajhane main aasaani hoti he
 we love each other very much
 hamane kabhi gaali nahin di
 In the spot you fight with someone you fear or respect
 ’kapil dev ne pressure ke bare main kaha, ‘jab ham khelte the tab pakistan kii team hamase behatar thi
 Our team has become much better in the last 15 years
 jab aap jeet ke prati aashwast hote hai to pressure khud ba khud kam ho jaataa he
 'question: india-pakistan match for the first time in the 1992 World Cup
 ajahar aapaki captaini main pressure to bahut rahaa hoga?ajahariiham pehali baar world cap main khele or jite iske baad se lagaataar jitate aa rahe hai
 Once it happened that i was in a lot of pressure on such an occasion, when we won the match, i felt that the reason for 100 kg was removed from me
 kapil devahapako har insaan aakar match nahin haarane kii baat kah kar jaataa he, chaahe vah chaay vaala ho yaa taxi driver
 Who wants to lose the match? When the ball is coming at a speed of 150, you have to perform there
 sawaal: 1996 main aamir sohail kii venkatesh prasad se kya baat ho rahi thi?aamir sohellantim chaar overon main jadeja jo dhunaai kar rahe the usase ham bahut pressure main the
 i was beating with extreme force
 main use apaset karnaa chahta tha, unka dhyaan bhang karnaa chahta tha
 Question: What is the pressure of not losing to Pakistan? Gavaskar: If the match is against Pakistan, then wherever you go, the person who brings your breakfast tells you that you must win today
 khel apni jagah he lekin jitani dosti bharat or pakistan ke khilaadiyon ke bich main he waisi dosti na to england-australia ke bich he na hi australia or newjiland ke bich
 Question: Is defeating India is bigger than winning the World Cup? Inzamam: If losing to India, the housemates do not talk properly
 ham lagaataar aapas main nahin khelte isse bahut fark padataa he
 If you play continuously, then the public on both sides will get used to it, this will not eliminate the pressure, but it will definitely be less
 sawaal: kya bharat-pakistan ke match main hi khilaadi apana best parform karte hai?ajay jadejatomen bada hua to bharat-paak cricket ko dekhte hue hi
 If you play well in the india-pakistan match then it is the sprinting board
 meri us pari ke baad team main chatha number pakkaa ho gaya
 Azharuddin: When we were playing the Sahara Cup, Inzamam got into a fight with a spectator
 tab puri bhartiya team unke saath thi
 Both countries should play more and more
 sawaal: 1987 main world cap ke dauraan aapane apni pehali or sabase tej centuri lagaai thi, lekin ab ipel kii tarj par vanade khelaa ja rahaa he?gavaskarvarulls change hue hai, bat bahut achche ho gaye hai
 In our time 200–250 runs were considered very good scores
 lekin ab 300-350 ran banegaa tabhi aap sef ho sakate hai
 Question: How should it be handled when there is a dispute between India and Pakistan on the ground? Aamir Sohail: It should be allowed to happen at that time, it acts like a pen killer whose effect is reduced after some time

 The Hindi serial 'is Pyar Ko Kya Naam Doon' is a favorite serial seen in Turkey during prime time
 pichley chaar varshon se isaki apruval retings main koi giravat nahin ai he
 Actually, the twist and turn of its love story is very much liked by the Turkish audience
 sho ko turki main dab kiya gaya or 'bir garip ask' ke naam se dikhaaya jaataa he, jo ki channel kanal 17 par prasaarit hota he
 According to the channel's sub-manager Yasim, the show is quite pleasing to the Turkish audience
 yasim ne bataaya ki sirf 'is pyaar ko kya naam duun' hi nahin, balki anya dharawahik 'ek baar phir', 'utaran', 'balika vadhu', 'saraswatichandra' jaise dharawahikon ko bhi log kaaphi pasand kar rahe hai
 Yasim is part of a large team of Turkish media persons

 tab ise non-prime time kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya tha, lekin iske prati logon kii utsukata or tiarapy dekh ise march 2016 main prime time shrenee main 9 baje se prasaarit kiya jane laga
 Yasim said, "there has been no decline in the approval ratings of this serial for the last four years
 ek baar jab log kisi dharawahik ko dekhnaa band kar dete hai, to channel ise apane prasaaran suchi se baahar kar detaa he
 It is a matter of craze of Bollywood films that Hindi serials are more popular in Turkey than in Bollywood films
 aamir khan abhinit film 'dangal', salmaan khan kii 'bajrangi bhaijan', shahrukh khan kii 'chennai express' or yahaan tak ki ruthik roshan-aishwarya abhinit film 'jodha akbar' kii filmein bhi lokapriy hai
 Other shows aired on Canal 17 include 'thapki Pyar Ki', 'saath Nibhana Saathiya'
 Congratulations to @shanerwatson33 who has called time on a stellar 59-test career

 vastav main is baar pujaara kii charchaa australia media or purv va vartmaan cricketron main viraat kohli se bhi zyada rahi

 com / iqjes845kmbaharahala, bharat kii jeet ke baad pehali baar langer ne kaha ki main apane kariyar main itnaa behtareen ballebaaj nahin dekha, jo gend ko itane najdiki se dekhtaa he
 Pujara's concentration remained a major challenge for the host team
 or hamaare ballebaaj or gendbaajon sabhi ko pujaara kii tarah lagaataar behatar hona hoga
 Langer said that the biggest reason for Pujara to score more than five hundred runs was his attention
 isi ke kaaran vah gend ko itani najdiki se dekh paane main kaamyaab rahete hai
 And then this leads to the graph of their runs
 mujhe yah kehane main koi sankoch nahin ki dhyaan ke maamle main pujaara sachin tendulkar or rahul dravid se bhi behatar hai
 Ahead of the upcoming ODI series, Langer said that it would take time for the Australian team to recover from the defeat as the loss of players' energy also drained along with the defeat
 or unke saamne chunauti yah he ki vah us bhartiya team se bhidane ja rahe hai, jo test kii tarah vanade formet main bhi mejabaanon se behatar he
 But Langer gave a warning to the Indians, saying that after defeating India in Nagpur in 2004, he was the best moment of my career
 mujhe lagata he ki viraat kohli or unke khilaadi bhi philhal kuch aisa mahasoos kar rahe honge
 In such a situation, Virat & Co
 has to be cautious of complacency
 jab aap sheersh par hote hai, to iskaa shikaar ho jate hai
 
 langer ne kaha ki bharat se haar nirashajanak he, lekin ham behatar team se haare hai
 And this is our chance to improve ourselves in both Test and ODI formats
 hamen is par dhyaan kendrit karnaa he
 We have talent

 ' dizin ko samajhane ke liye agar aap teleportesan shabd kaa istemaal karen, to haal main dilli main amejan india fishan wyk main gaurav jai gupta ke sho kaa sateek vivaran de paaenge
 Gupta used an Icelandic-style color palette — a combination of icy green, pungent blue and flickering gray colors — to show her when a wave of models emerged on the ramp wearing her tailored costumes
 isaki prishthbhumi main damak rahi svarnim or ispati chaandi kii abha unki rachanaatmakataa ke dussahas kaa udhaaharan thi
 The pale green shadows were a sign of weakness, while bronze and gold splashes gave an impression of muted power
 gupta un nai peedi ke dizinron main ek hai jinhen maid-in-india diginon ko vaishvik manchon par le jane main koi sankoch nahin hota
 His work does not have the flamboyance of Manish Arora, on whom he was the first Indian to reach the Parisian fashion highway, but it is a thin whisper that resonates in Indian handicrafts like Chanderi and Zari while its shadow is internationally The runway is reflected in the ready cut

 This new narrative of Indian fashion is riding two boats of modern design and centuries-old heritage, which testify to a generation that is building a new identity of Indian fashion

 The silhouettes in Gupta's collection at Fashion Week were absolutely clean and minimal, the cut and shredded fabric felt as if no one had touched it yet

 Crafted from woven experimental fabric from rural handicrafts, Gupta's work underscores the newfound sense of fashion: its roots are local but language global! Says Anupama Pasricha, associate professor of merchandising and design at St
 Catherine University in Minnesota, USA
 Rahul Mish in terms of heritage of Indian architecture and designing for global consumers
 Ra, the distinction appears Jai Gupta and Suket stand cold-blooded different

 Their designs are contemporary and amazing, whose color palette is global
 "is nae kaam kii apil itani zyada he ki suket dheer or rahul mishra ne kramshah 2016 or 2014 main apane mensavier or vimensvier collection ke liye international vulmark puraskaar jeet liya tha
 The award brought Mishra to a prestigious slot at Paris Fashion Week this year from Malhousie in Uttar Pradesh when her work was screened between the Hermes and Mayhew shows

 He has six stores worldwide and his merchandise is sold in retail in 45 stores

 When he started in 2006, the era was being called the "age of Bling", and as such it took a lot of courage and patience to be associated with handlooms and handicrafts
 unhone kapadon ko is tarah se dhaala ki ve antarrashtriya samvednaaon se to judate dikhe lekin unke bheetar kii anivaary bhartiyata bhi bani rahe
 His blend of wool and Chanderi embroidered with the Tree of Life embroidery was designed for the International Woolmark Collection that earned him a distinct identity from the rest
 mishra kehete hai ki unke kapade sirf fishan kaa paryaay nahin hai, balki unamem bhavanaaen bhi hai
 Mishra, a student of science, says that he understands the importance of timelessness
 unka falsafa bahut saral he- hastshilp ko agle charan tak le janaa, rudh bandhanon se use aaazaad karnaa, siluate se kalakaari karnaa or maid in india lagjri label ko taiyaar karnaa
 He says, "I want weavers to benefit
" main sirf ek utpaada nahin, dizin pranali viksit karnaa chahta hum
 i am ready for the world now
 " ve maanate hai ki fishan ke bare main isse zyada protsaahit karne vaali baat kuch nahin ho sakati ki yah aisi nai paristhitiki viksit karne main sakasham ho jaae jisamen bunakaron ko vaishvik manchon kaa laabh mili or apane shram kaa sakvamaan hasil ho

 "local acceptance is needed," he says

 Manish Arora and Rahul Mishra are identified in Paris but both are on opposite poles in terms of Indian design
 bhartiya antarrashtriya fishan kaa vakt abhi nahin aayaa he
 "it is a different thing that new designers are reaching there and challenging the concept of racy and coarse blue-pink costumes
 bazaar ke liye banaae jane vaale bees kilo ke lahange or statement sadixan ek aise nav upabhokta varg kii jarurat ko puraa karne ke liye the jo inhen pahanane ko apni shakhsiyat se jodakar dekhte the

 iske badale prashansa bhi mil rahi he, jinke sabase taaja paatr dilli ke neshnal institute of fishan technology se padhe dheer hai
 When the models took off their jackets during the Woolmark Awards ceremony at the world's foremost menswear trade fair held in Pitti Uomo, Florence, the judges remembered the old days when they saw the embroidery on the linings
 deele palagero pant or lambey jacket ke siluate unke dada des raaj dheer kii style se prerit the
 Within were the motifs of parrots, mango trees and umbrellas — these images were expressed in Dheer's work from the memories of the summer vacation he spent with the textile merchant Dada
 inkaa pallate nile or pile kii chhaviyon kaa ek contrast tha
 Seeing the work of Dheer, the powerful personalities of fashion from all over the world accepted the new aesthetic change
 pile rang kii chhaviyon ne bhram kaa ant kar diya
 The success of this new consignment of designers lies in their originality
 punjab main paley-bade dheer (36 varsh) kehete hai ki puraane dinon kii smritiyon ne hi unhen antarrashtriya manch kaa rasta dikhaaya
 Like Mishra, he used embroidery on his finished clothes, including wool which, being lighter, could be worn in summer as well
 ve bunakaron ke saath ek rishta kaayam karne main yakeen karte hai
 "there is a difference between homogeneous and traditional," he says

 They use cotton, linen, bamboo, fine muslin and silk blend
 or ye kuch alagataiyar nahin, sile hue kapadedusri ore arjuna saluja ke kaam main aisa kuch bhi maheen nahin he
 The roughness of the experience, the splatter of the paint, the broken figures, the dust and mud are reflected in his costumes, which are a visual document of his journey from Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh to New York and then to Delhi
 ek aise desh main jahaan kapade ab bhi apni jarurat ke hisaab se silvaaye jate hon or chamakdaar rangon ko tarjeeh di jaati ho, saluja ke banaae ubhayalingi (stri-purush donon ke liye) or bahaavdaar drepe unhen alag pahchaan dete hai

 We are trying to mold these fabrics into our design thinking and experimenting with weights, as structure and drape are central in our work
 " ve kehete hai ki fishan ek kism kii abhivyakti he or yah niztaa taiyaar karata he
 Fashion is an attitude and it is like seeing
 apane sharp cat or bold strecchar ke liye charchit saluja kehete hai ki pattern kating ahm he kyonki sharir ek triayami sanrachana he jabaki kapadaa dwiaiami hota he
 That is why it is very important to understand the proportions and structures during pattern formation
 dusron se ulat saluja ne kabhi bhi na to mahilaon or na hi purushon ko ''yunakarshak" banane main vishwaas kiya
 They say that their work focuses on sensuality, not sexuality
 ve shuruyaat main rangamanch ke kalakaar bananaa chaahate the
 This is where the theatricality in his design comes from
 patricia fields ke sailan main kaam karne ke dauraan unhen ubhayalingi paridhaanon kaa vichaar aayaa
 During this work she designed for the TV series Sex and the City in which Fields was the stylist for the lead character Carrie Bradshaw
 apane kariyar ke aarambh ve hi apana label rishta bharat main launch karne se pehle neuyork le gaye
 He did this so that the Indians could show silhouettes by placing them against ornaments and surface ornamentation — as well as the Indian cut
 saluja kaa sara hunar yahi he
 In Japan, his label was sold at Henry Bendel and found in the iconic stores Barneys and Anthropology in New York
 ve kehete hai, ''kuch is tarah hamane shuruyaat kii

 Samift Chauhan, a nift-trained knitwear designer, hails from Dharhara, a small village in Bihar and knows everything about Binai, especially when it is Bhagalpuri Silk

 “india's fashion industry needs to take some tough decisions to become competitive worldwide

 Menon says, "we have not yet formulated any measurement system of India

 "the second question is of the social audit, which is carried out by international retailers such as Saks Fifth Avenue who test the number of weavers here, their labor conditions, hours of work and allowances

 The last question is of scale

 The designer wear industry in India is Rs 1,000 crore
 kaa he jo vaishvik bazaar kaa chota hissaa he
 Menon points out that Anita Dongre has been the most successful multibrand structure so far with 700 sales outlets, 185 exclusive brand stores and 600 multibrand large format stores in 84 cities
 inke kareeb or koi nahin pahunch sakaa he, bhale hi sabyasachi or manish malhotra sau-sau karod ru
 Do business of iske baavjood fishan samudaay fail rahaa he
 There are an estimated 700–800 designs in the country

 New styles and new fabrics coming out of this place have caught the attention of the world
 ateet kii chhayapurane shilp or kapadon kaa punarjanmayahi vajah he ki bacand pradaata ke rup main kaam karte rahe kuch diziner ab apni sharton par apane label lekar aa rahe hai
 An example of this is Pallavi Mohan, who grew up in Guwahati and spent a lot of time in the tea gardens of the area
 unhone hand aplic or packwork ke kaam se apana label ijad kiya he jiskaa naam he ''note so syrius", jo bharat main vanijyik str par sarvaadhik chaalu brands main ek he

 The minister launched a campaign on social media in August aimed at encouraging the handloom industry
 is abhiyaan kaa samaapan 7 agast ko rashtriya hathrakagha diwas par unke banaras daure se hua jo lakhon bunakaron kaa shahar he
 This was an extension of the efforts of the Central Government in this direction: In June this year, the Center spent Rs 6,000 crore for the textile and apparel industry

 The potential of cloth in India has not been sufficiently exploited till now
 iske liye patibaddhta kii jarurat hoti he, bhitari ilaakon main janaa padataa he taaki bunkaree or motiff main ho rahe badlaavon ko samajha ja sake
 Sally Holkar, co-founder of Rehwa Society, a non-profit organization working among weavers since 1979 in Maheshwar, Madhya Pradesh, says handloom support is essential for sustainable fashion
 fishan kii vidwaan or maanav shastri philida je kahati hai ki paramparaagat bunakari or shilp kii bhoomika kai bhartiya dizinron ke kaam ke centre main he or unki pahchaan ko banaati he
 She says, "this means that the question of morality and livelihood of craftsmen inevitably arises constantly during the dialogues in the fashion world
" yah kai chunauteepurn sawaalon ko janm detaa he lekin bhartiya dijaanaron ke liye adbhut avasar bhi muhaiyaa karaata he ki ve khud ko global leader ke rup main alag se sthapit kar saken

 As soon as Amitabh Bachchan spoke in his passionate style to the famous dialogue of the film 'aaj Khush Toh Hoge Hoge Tum', the energy level of the students present at India Today mindrocks16 event increased
 sadi ke mahanayake amitabh se baat karne or unke vichaaron ko sunne ke liye yang students behad utsahit najar aae, mauka tha india today group kii ore se yojit maid rox 16 event kaa jahaan amitabh bachchan haalia relies film 'pink' kii star cast ke saath pahunche
 The film 'pink' and its important issues related to it, expressed their opinion in this way
 amitabh bachchan ne apni film pink or unke dwaara potee or nathin ko likhe gaye khat ke bare main sabase pehle yah bataaya ki unki is film kaa nichod hi unka aradhya or navya ke liye likhaa gaya khat tha
 Amitabh said - i put the real message of the film Pink in this letter
 amitabh ke is khat main ek ladki ko har tarah kii bandishon jaise aise kapade mat pahano, baahar mat jaao, yah mat karo wo mat karo se free rahanaa or yah sochna band kar dena ki log kya kahenge jaise massej dene kii koshish kii he
 Amitabh said that his letter is not only for every girl but also for every boy
 ladakon ko bhi is baat kaa ilm jarur hona chahie ki ladakiyon ko unhen kaise sammaan dena he
 Bachchan Bol: 1
 ek pita ke rup main mujhe bhi tension hoti he jab mere ghar kii betiyaan baahar jaati hai, unke waapas lautne kaa intjaar rahata he
 But as a parent it is natural

 i have an answer for girls being undermined by boys, during the KBC show a girl was sitting on the hot seat in front of me
 main uski kahani se behad prabhavit hua
 When the girl told that after just 7 years of age, her father stopped her from reading that she would get married tomorrow, so why spend money on her studies
 yah bacchee apni shiksha ke liye ladi or ghar chhodkar apane kisi rishtedaar ke ghar rahane lagi, lekin vahaan bhi uski padhai par roak lagaai jane lagi
 That is how the girl read herself and is sitting on the hot seat of KBC today
 yakeen maniye us ladki ne 25 lakh rupee is sho se jite or jab maine unase poocha ki ab aap in paison kaa kya karengi to vah boli, jaakar apane pita ko duungi or kahuungi ki sirf betaa hi nahin beti bhi ghar kii sampatti ho sakati he
 3
 main ek baat jarur kahana chaahunga ki agar koi aurat aapke saath baithkar drink le rahi he to iskaa matlab yah nahin ki wo avelable he
 If the girl is not asking for anything, then she does not mean, the same message has been tried in the film Pink and it is very important for the society to understand it
 4
 If a girl weeps emotionally, then there is nothing wrong in a man crying
 kai dfa bahut se mail ko-stars or set par maujuud baaki aadamiyon ko bhavuk hokar rote dekha he hamane, yahaan tak ki main khud bhi royaa hum, to mujhe lagata he ki ek aadmi agar rota he to isamen koi buraai nahin he
 5
 main apane kariyar ke kamyaabi kaa shrey apni maa ko dena chaahunga
 She always used to give me courage for my work or any small thing
 jaise ki bachapan kii hi baat karen, jab main shaam ko khel kar ghar lautataa tha to or maa ke saamne rokar kahata tha ki maa mujhe us ladke ne peeta to vah kahati thim turant laut jaao or use jawaab do yaa pito lekin ghar rote hue mat aao

 in tasveeron main saaf najar aa rahaa he ki jiya ke gale, kandhe or haath par chot ke gahare jakhm the
 There are 10 to 15 wounds on his lips

 It seems that Jiya was strangled after badly injuring her and the body was hung from the fan
 ' parivaar kaa aarope he ki jiya ko pehle maaraa-peeta gaya or phir hatya ko is tarah anjaam diya gaya ki vah aatmahatya jaisi lage
 These are the arguments of the lawyer # Jia has bruises on her lips, throat, hands and shoulders
 police ne jaanch ke dauraan isaki andekhi kyon kii? # jiya pankhe tak pahunchane ke liye stool kii jarurat padati
 But no such thing was present in the room
 # kamare main do jagah khun ke nishaan paae gaye
 Whereas if someone hangs, there is no blood in it
 iske baad bhi police ne blad report pesh nahin kii
 # The hanging traces on Jiya's neck were straightforward, whereas in case of suicide, it should be in the 'V shape', because when something is hung from the rope, it creates a stretch from top to bottom
 # ghatana ke din jab jiya ghar lautin to unhone trek pant pahani hui thi, lekin unka shav nity main baraamad hua
 # The room window was open and AC was also on
 ye sthiti bhi shaq paidaa karti he
