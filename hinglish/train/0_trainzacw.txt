 Political skirmishes have continued in Karnataka for the last 15 days
 is bich shuukravaar ko vidhansabha main floor test hona he lekin echdi kumaraswami kii sarkaar jis tarah se is prakriya main aage bad rahi he
 It does not seem that the floor test will be held on Friday only
 rajyapal ne jo shuukravaar dopaher 1
 Deadline was given at 30 o'clock, that too has been exceeded
 aisa hi aarope bhartiya janata party bhi congress or jedies par laga rahi he
 In such a situation, with which strategy HD Kumaraswamy is moving forward and what kind of message he is giving to the public, understand here
 
 
 raajnneetik vishleshkon kii maane, to beete do dinon se jis tarah vidhansabha main kaarywahi chal rahi he usase saaf dikh rahaa he ki congress or jedies donon hi vishwaas mat par voting karaane ko taalna chaahate hai
 This is because they feel that the government does not have a majority figure
 isi sthiti main echdi kumaraswami ne do din main do baar vidhansabha ko sambodhit kiya
 In both the addresses, he did not give any indication that it seemed that he was going to resign immediately
 haalanki, lagaataar unhone bhaashanon main ‘majaburi main mukhyamantri’ vaale sanket jarur die
 'yeddyurappa becomes the next CM', the BJP MP climbed 1001 steps of the temple, the BJP MP demanded that it is clear from the signs that Kumaraswamy himself does not want to resign but wants to take the action forward
 ab agar karrwai aage badhati he, sadan main vishwaas mat prastaav par voting nahin hoti he to rajyapal vajubhai vaala ko maamle main dakhal dena hoga
 Because he himself has ordered voting
 aisi sthiti main rajyapal sarkaar par ection le sakate hai yaa phir centre sarkaar se madad le sakate hai
 Significantly, the Governor also works as per the advice of the Union Home Ministry
 agar centre ection main aati he or rajya sarkaar ko barkhaast kiya jaataa he yaa phir raashtrapati shashan lagaaya jaataa he
 So in this situation, HD Kumaraswamy can call charges against the Bharatiya Janata Party by forcibly removing him from the post of CM
 jiskaa phayda aane vaale vidhansabha chunaav main janata ke saamne jaakar bhi uthaaya ja saktaa he

 khabar hairaan kar dene vaali he
 Many villages have been sold in the western part of Rajasthan adjacent to the border of Pakistan
 lekin jinke khet bike, unhen hi is baat keebhanak tak nahin lagi
 Villages of unsold villages sold in Faloda area near the border
 saikadon kisaan or unki 24,000 bighas se zyada jameen-jagirdaar se kisaan kangaal ho gaye hai or inako samaj nahin aa rahaa, karen to kya karen
 When the wind blew in the area that the villages have been sold, the peasants rushed to investigate their ownership
 lekin wo yah jaanakar hairaan rah gaye ki falodi ke kanasar, raneri, tepu, kellansar, zamba, loonna jaise tamaam gaanv kisi or ke naam ho chuke hai
 Of these, 2276 bighas have been registered at the rate of 5%
 itnaa hi nahin sarkari khajaane main 32 karod 76 lakh rupee bhi jamaa ho chuke hai
 The land of the farmers is written in the name of Ashapuri Developers Private Limited of Delhi and Maitreya Services Private Limited of Maharashtra, Vasai
 hairat kii baat to ye he ki kisaan jaanate tak nahin ki jameen bechi kisne or kharidi kisne
 The matter is in the police station and the police is investigating
 lekin had to ye he ki ghotaale kii bhent chadhe in kisaanon ko apni hi jameen waapas lene ke liye ab 5 fisadi stamp dena hoga
 The question is also about the safety of border areas

 In the Bihar Assembly elections, the strength of the Congress is also at stake
 yaa yun kahen ki rahul gandhi kii shaakh daanv par lagi he to galat nahin hoga
 The way Rahul revived the Congress in Uttar Pradesh in the last Lok Sabha election, he will show some miracles of the same kind in Bihar
 vaise to bihar main congress kaa astitv naganya hi he lekin is baar vidhansabha kii sabhi 243 siton par chunaav lard rahi he or ummid kar rahi he ki jediu-bijepi gathbandhan or argedy-lojpa se ub chuke log ab congress ko hi apana rahanuma chunenge
 In the last Lok Sabha election, the Congress parted ways with Lalu and Paswan and on this, lalu-paswan also decided not to support the Congress in the assembly elections
 lalu to yahaan tak kah chuke hai ki sirf jediu-bijepi gathbandhan ko phayda pahunchane ke liye hi congress sabhi 243 siton par chunaav lard rahi he
 This time, if the Congress gets votes, then it will also get because it has been a long time for people to try Congress
 jo matadaata lalu se naaraaz hai or nitish se kush nahin hai wo congress ke saath aa sakate hai
 The number of such people can also be large
 congress kii sabase badi samasya yah he ki uske paas nitish kumaar, lalu prasad yadav or ramvilas paswan kii tarah koi charchit cheharaa nahin he
 At present, Chaudhary Mehboob Ali Qaisar is the President of Bihar Congress, who replaced Anil Sharma as President
 dekha jaae to congress main sonia or rahul ko chhodkar bihar main koi bhi charchit cheharaa nahin he or iskaa khamiyaja shaayad use bihar chunaav main bhugatna bhi pade
 Although Rahul Gandhi seems to be very successful in drawing crowds in Congress's election meetings in Bihar, it does not seem that in this election he will be able to garner much votes for Congress
 lekin shaayad bhavishya main rahul gandhi ko apni is kavayad kaa laabh mili
 There are increasing reports of atrocities with minority communities in Pakistan
 chaahe vah hindu ho yaa sikh yaa isai
 The latest case is of a village called Dera Chahal in Lahore, where Gulab Singh Shaheen is the first Sikh police officer (posted as Sub Inspector Traffic) of Pakistan
 unako unke ghar se ETPB (ivakui trust sampatti board) or sthaneey police ne milakar jabardasti bedakhal kar diya
 Inspector Gulab Singh said in a conversation with Aaj Tak / India Today that these people also scrambled with him and took off his turban
 unhone khaas baatcheet main kaha ki main or meraa parivaar san 1947 se is ghar main rah rahe he
 This house is in Dera Chahal village which comes in the gurudwara premises of Babe Nanaki, sister of Guru Nanak, the entire village is situated on the land of this gurudwara, this land belongs to the gurudwara but the ETBP people want to make it compulsory, that is why this matter is in the court Pending but suddenly entered his house on Tuesday, ETBP and local police men forced him and his family out of the house without notice
 Fired Su
 jabardastee ghar se baahar nikalagulab singh ne kaha ki is puure gaanv kaa maamla court main he, lekin sirf mujhe hi nishaanaa banaaya gaya or meraa ghar khaali karavaaya gaya
 The condition of the minority in Pakistan can only be gauged by the fact that when the police arrived to evacuate, Govind Singh Shaheen asked for 10 minutes, but the police did not listen to them and forcefully shouted Got it emptied
 gulab singh ne kaha ki mampakistanka pehla sikh trephic wardan hum lekin mere saath aisa saluk kiya ja rahaa he jaisaa choron-daakuon ke saath kiya jaataa he
 He said that despite the case going on in court, 'tariq Wazir who is an additional secretary of ETPB and Tara Singh, former head of Pakistan Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, has done this to make some people happy
 jab ajtak / india today ne itipibi ke adishnal secratory tarik vajeer se kai baar sampark kiya lekin tarik vajeer phone par nahin aae or meeting main vayastata kaa hawala dete hue baat karne se inkaar kar diya
 The agitation in Punjab, where Shiromani Akali Dal leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa, after forcibly evicting Gulab Singh, the first Sikh police officer from Nepal, from his home in Lahore, demanded action from Sushma Swaraj and the Pakistan High Commission, saying that his turban Was insulted unako paak police ne 10 minute kaa bhi samay nahin diya or unke puure parivaar ko second main phenk diya

 When Rumi's family comes to know about this, they bet that Vicky has to marry Rumi, then she will have to come home and ask for his hand
 kahani main twist tab aata he jab rumi kii shaadi enarai robi (abhishek bachchan) se tay ho jaati he, is baat ko sunakar vicky kaaphi baukhala jaataa he
 The story takes many turns and eventually goes through a lot of situations, which you will have to watch the film to know
 kyon dekh sakate hai:film kii kahani saamaanya he, lekin anuraag kashyap ne apane andaaj main ise dikhaaya he
 Ishq, which flourishes in the streets of Amritsar, has been introduced by putting different flavors
 film ke dwaara apane jamaane kii mashhoor lekhika amrutha preetam ko shukriya adaa bhi kiya gaya he
 Filming of songs is a big role
 kundali, grey vaala shed, darya , chonch, sachhee mohabbat jaise geet iske screenple ko nikhaarate hai
 Amit Trivedi, Lyrics Writer Style and all the singers deserve congratulations for this
 vicky kaushal ko ek deje ke kirdaar main dikhaaya gaya he jo ki hosh or behoshee main alag-alag jone main rahata he
 Vicky has done a good job
 taapasi pannu kaa rumi kaa kirdaar bahut badhiya he or ishk kii intahaa ko unki ankhon main dekha ja saktaa he
 Abhishek Bachchan has made a comeback to the silver screen after a gap and played the character of Robbie, who needed different shades and is also seen
 ek tarah se jo tipical hindi romantic prem trikon par aadhaarit filmon ke liye jaruri samagriyaan hoti hai, wo sab kuch is film hai

 However, in his Dev d Pardesi song, 2 boys have appeared in a pub doing some similar dance
 kamazor kadiyaan:film kii kamjor kadi isaki raftaar he, jo kii bahut badi samasya bhi he
 Everything is progressing very slowly slowly
 ek vakt ke baad aisa lagata he ki film kaa interval kab hoga, clymex bhi kaaphi bada he, jise crisp kiya jaataa to film or bhi behatar najar aati 
 With this, it seems that what Anurag was trying to say is lost somewhere and love seems to disappear somewhere in the middle of the fire
 khaas taur par vicky kaushal kaa kirdaar nyaaysangat najar nahin aa paata
 Box office: The cost of the film is being reported at around 30 crores

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi assured that corruption in the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGA) was a great injustice to the poor people of the country and that no core effort would be left to overcome it
 ise bhrashtachar mukt banane ke liye yojana ko soochna ke adhikaar kanoon ke tahat laane kaa vaayada kiya gaya
 On the occasion of completion of five years of MGNREGA, at a function held at Vigyan Bhawan here, the Prime Minister promised that its system will be improved and the technology will be put into use to make it corruption free
 Could
 tippaniyan Singh asked to prepare biometric data (photo identification of fingers and mannequins) of laborers working under MGNREGA to ensure salary payment within 15 days
 unhone kaha ki isse manaregaa mazdooron kii upasthiti or unhen kiye jane vaale vetan bhugtan ko lekar dhaandhliyon ko roka ja sakegaa
 On this occasion, Sonia Gandhi said that corruption and irregularities in MNREGA cannot be ignored
 unhone kaha, ‘‘manaregaa main bhrashtachar na sirf desh ke garibon ke prati anyaay he balki mahatma gandhi ke naam par aparaadh karne jaisaa bhi he
 He said that some states, especially those which are considered to be relatively poor, there is a clear indifference to the implementation of MNREGA
 singh ne 15 din ke bheetar vetan bhugtan sunishchit karne ke liye manaregaa ke tahat kaam karne vaale mazdooron kaa biomitric data (anguliyon or putliyon ke photo pahchaan) taiyaar karaane kii baat kahi
 He said that this will prevent the rigging of the presence of MNREGA workers and the payment of salaries to them
 is avasar par sonia gandhi ne kaha ki manaregaa main bhrashtachar or aniyamittaaon ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 He said, "corruption in MNREGA is not only an injustice towards the poor of the country but it is also like committing a crime in the name of Mahatma Gandhi
 ’’ unhone kaha ki kuch rajyon, khaskar aise rajya jo apekshaakrit garib maane jate hai, vahaan manaregaa ko lagu karne ko lekar udaseenta saaf dikh rahi he
 On this occasion, Sonia Gandhi said that corruption and irregularities in MNREGA cannot be ignored
 unhone kaha, ‘‘manaregaa main bhrashtachar na sirf desh ke garibon ke prati anyaay he balki mahatma gandhi ke naam par aparaadh karne jaisaa bhi he

 britani darshanik jon lock kaa kahana tha ki vyangy is baat main nihit hota he ki vichaaron ko kis tarah se rakhaa gaya he
 Also, how quickly and diversely they have been given a ranking
 unka sochna thik hi tha
 Every generation has its own standards of criticism, but there is no doubt that humor brings out the softness and highness of feeling
 iske bagaiyr baaten be-swaad or mehfil nihaayat hi boring ho jaaegi
 In such a situation, it can be said that the more advanced the language, the greater the scope of humor and satire
 tanjo-majaah yaa hasya or vyangy ko saamaajik bol-chaal, muhjjab baatcheet yaa sabhy samvaad main kabool kiya gaya or vah kaaphi lokapriy bhi hua or isane sahitya kii ek style ke taur par apni pahchaan banaai
 Much of the credit for this goes to Urdu poet Nazir Akbarabadi (1740–1830) because he chose this ground and never left its expanding realm
 unamem apni baat ko haasyatmak or vyangyatmak dhang se kehane kaa fan kuta-kootakar bharaa hua tha
 This thing fully emerges in his poetry
 ve sanjeeda vishay main bhi vyangy paidaa karne kaa hunar jaanate the
 Mirza Ghalib (1797–1869) was a master at the art of satire or tanja, his satire consisted of irony and he targeted Mullah and Sheikh for his satire
 ve unki hansi isliye udaate yaa unako apane tanj kaa nishaanaa isliye banaate kyonki ve bevakoof or bhrasht the or jab ve shaasha varg kii hansi udaate to ve unke siddhanton kii aalochana nahin karte balki satta ke galat istemaal ko nishaanaa banaate
 i am also a great supporter of the genius Urdu poet Akbar Allahabad (1846–1921), who elevated the art of satire to the status of fine arts
 unamem shabdon ko tod-marod kar unke arthon ko badalane kii jabardast kala thi
 They used to use pun and idioms to create humor and sarcasm
 unki shaayari main vyangy or ek prakaar kii sanak saath-saath maujuud hoti he or khaas taur se jab ve pashchim ke bhautikwaad, apane samaaj kii bevakoofi, pashchimi shiksha ke nattejey main aane vaale vicitra rasmo-rivaaj or un logon ke bholepan ko apane vyangy kii dhar par kasate jo yah sochate the ki ve puri tarah se aaazaad ho chuke hai
 If his poetry is alive today, it is not because of its relevance in our time, but because of the finest combination of satire and humor
 jaraa in panktiyon par gaur karen:kya kahen ahabaab kya kaare-numaayan kar gaebie kiya, naukar hue, pension mili phir mar gaye
 Yarqeeb has written a report to the police station that Akbar takes the name of God in this era
 bharat main rahane vaale britani log apni sarkaar par kiye jane vaale rajnatik majaak yaa vyangy kaa bura nahin maanate the
 The truth is that he promoted many magazines like Awadh Panch, Parsi Panch and these
 kaash! kapil sibbal ko ensiiarti kii pathyapustakon se ‘aapattijanak’ cartoon hataane ke apane mishan par nikalne se pehle yah sab pataa hota
 Hopefully! Our leaders are so flat-faced, always think of themselves as right and would not be so dull
 kalakatta se prakashit hone vaale akhbaar da indian nesan ke 7 april, 1854 ke ank main likhaa hua tha ki mizaaj main mithaas paidaa karne, haasyaaspad chizon kaa anand lene or chizon main hasya ke pahalu nikaalane ke liye hasya jaisi kalaon kaa srijan jaruri he
 And in 1881, Archibald Constable, a member of the Royal Asiatic Society, rejected the widespread belief that Indians do not have humor and do not understand jokes
 sach to yah he ki hazirajvaabi, hasya or vyangy kaa dakshin asia main ek purana silsilaa rahaa he
 The weekly Awadh Panch published from Lucknow in the second half of the nineteenth century became popular from house to house due to its dignity, harmony and its superior choice
 hasya or vyangy main gunvattta kisi muhaavarey ko ulat-palat dene yaa uttejnaa paidaa karne vaali kisi baat se nahin aati balki yah sateek yaa chubte vaakyansh, shabdon ke khel, uccharan se chhedchhad or isi tarah kii duusari chizon se aati he
 One example of this is taken from Pandit Motilal Nehru, the president of the Congress and father of Jawaharlal Nehru
 ek baar kii baat he unke bawarchi ne andon kaa vyanjan pesh kiya
 a guest looking at the eggs asked in a nervous manner, "panditji, you will not eat eggs
 ’’ pandit ji ne jawaab diya, ‘‘shartiya taur par khaaenge
 "in this he further added that"

 In many ways, the oligarchs of India were composed in the culture of the entire West
 sarojini naidu bhi kuch bhinn nahin thim
 He had a deep sense of appreciation of poetry and a sense of humor, satire and irony
 hasya-vyangy or hazirajvaabi se sarabor sarojini naidu kavita ke rajmarg se siyasat main aa gai thim
 Once, Gandhiji talked to him in some way, "hey! You must be Mrs
 Naidu! Who else can afford to be so stupid? Come, have dinner with me
 ’’unki mulaakaat 8 agast, 1914 ko landan main hui thi
 Sarojini Naidu said this on Gandhi ji's 78th birth anniversary, something like this: "and in a funny way, we had a friendship that lasted so long
" ’’ gandhi ji kii saadagi bhari or tapasvi jindagi shraddha or vismay kii sanyukt bhaavana paidaa karti thi lekin mazaakia lahaze main hi naidu ne kaha tha ki logon ko pataa nahin ki gandhi ko garib banaae rakhane main kitna kharchaa aata he
 Naidu was the one who helped to make Gandhi ji feel happy
 vyangy ke kuch behtareen namoonay hamen moulana abul kalam aaazaad kii kitaab gubaar-e khatir main milte hai
 Even in his intellectual and esoteric things, there was a syrup of light satire
 unke kareebi dost bataate hai ki yah unamem chidchidepan main bhi hota tha, jo ki bharat ke vibhaajan ke aakhri dinon main un par haaavee ho gaya tha
 In one of his books, he presents a beautiful lion, which perfectly portrays his high level of satire
 kisi ne ek dfa likhaa tha ki (landan ke ) hide park ke kisi kone main raajnneeti or desh-duniya ke tamaam vishyon par ek ghante main malumat kaa jo bhandar hasil kiya ja saktaa he vah haftebhar akhbaar padhakar bhi hasil nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Can we say the same thing about our Parliament and Assembly? It is a matter of regret that our mps today are severely lacking this
 unki baton ko rochak banaae rakhane ke liye jaruri jindadilii or eemaandaaree kii kami he
 Hikrat and hostility are hidden even in their loud laughter in Parliament
 haalanki 1950 or 1960 ke dashak main saansadon ke bich aapas main vaad-vivaad, hansi-majaak, chhedchhad or fabtiyaan kasne kii baat sunne ko milti hai
 These speeches usually focused on leaders, evangelists, elite classes and people who wanted to campaign
 khaas taur par shabdon se khilne main logon ko kaaphi majaa aata tha
 Did Jawaharlal Nehru belong to the elite? On this, Ram Manohar Lohia, a staunch critic of Nehru and socialist leader in Parliament, said "no"
 main sabit kar saktaa hum ki unke dada mughal darbar main chaparasi the
 "jawaharlal Nehru replied," i am happy that finally the honorable member has accepted what i was trying to understand for many years that i am a man of the people

 i think it is a good thing that a courageous group of poets, writers, journalists have been given out of the world of dull, colorless, cautious and niggard prose to provide some freshness, variety and some degree of exaggeration to their readers

 Perhaps this is the first time that when the BSF killed a BSF jawan on the outskirts, the BSF gave a befitting reply within a few hours
 isko lekar jab maine seemaa par tainaat biguef ke ek senior adhikari se baat kii to unka jawaab saaf tha
 When our jawans were on patrolling, suddenly the Pakistani Rangers started firing on them, fired not more than five bullets on one jawan and then fired on the jawans with grenades, our jawan was killed in the same place
 phir ham kya karte, aadhe ghante ke andar hamane bhi do pakistaniyon ko maar giraaya or kuch ghanton ke bheetar do or
 Leave aside the injured
 itnaa hi nahin mare hue pakistani javaanon kaa shav wo 5 baje ke baad tab uthaa paae jab dilli se hukum pahunchaa or wo safed jhande ke saath aage aae
 Now also remember the day when a year ago, Pakistani soldiers had taken away the head of one of our jawans to Pakistan on Mendhar loc near Poonch and left the body of another jawan in a deformed condition
 haalanki sena ne uskaa badla to jarur liya, lekin yah badla lene main chah maheene se zyada lag gaye
 It was also not that at that time our army and BSF soldiers were not able to take a proper answer, nor was there any lack of enthusiasm and enthusiasm in them

 Today, the government clearly dictates that if there is any nefarious act on the border, there should be no hesitation in responding to it
 to kya yah antar raajnneetik ichha shakti kaa he? yani agar seemaa paar se ek goli fire hoti he to uskaa jawaab das goliyon se diya jaae
 But when asked what will be the result, an army officer posted on the loc says that we have shown a lot of brotherhood, what we have got
 ab sakhti dikhaaenge to wo bhi kuch ulti harakat karne se pehle das baar sochenge to
 However, ever since a ceasefire agreement was reached with Pakistan to establish peace on the border, such immediate replies are not given

 It is necessary to mention here that 24 hours ago, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar had said that i will tell the army that do not provoke, give a proper answer

 While presenting the Interim Budget, Finance Minister Piyush Goyal in his speech “for the first time Rs 3 lakh crore

 Jasprit Bumrah, who was shocked by his selection in the first two Tests, will be left out
 paanchon tej gendbaajon ne net par abhyaas kiya jabaki bhubaneshwar, eshanth sharma, umesh yadav or mohammad shami ne jodiyon main ballebaaji kii
 The Indian captain may make another change tomorrow
 teen din ke brake ke baad ravivaar ko jab team yahaan juty tab se ajinkya rahane lagaataar net par abhyaas kar rahe hai
 In the last two days, he participated in four long practice sessions and he is set to play tomorrow as Rohit Sharma has been able to score 78 runs in four innings

 sarkaar dwaara mujhe die gaye aashwaasan se main santusht hum or main apana anshan khatm kar rahaa hum
 "fadnavis said that Hazare's close aide Sonpal Shastri would be a member of the committee that would be headed by Radha Mohan Singh
 siesipi ko swytt darja kii peshkash karne ke liye yah is saal oktober tak apni report puri karegi
 Anna Hazare said, "I have decided to end my fast after satisfactory negotiations with Fadnavis and others
 " fadanvis ne kaha ki lokapal ke liye search cameti kii baithak 13 farvari ko ho rahi he or yah ucchtam nyaayalay ke adeshon ke mutabik aage kaa faisla karegaa
 On Tuesday, the seventh day of Hazare's fast, his doctor said that his blood pressure and sugar were found to be elevated in laboratory tests
 anshan shuru karne ke baad se unka vajan paanch kigra ghat gaya
 It is noteworthy that Hazare started his fast demanding the appointment of Lokpal at the Center and Lokayuktas in those states in which such a statutory body monitoring against corruption has not yet been formed
 vah chunaav sudhaar evam krishi sankat ke samaadhaan ke taur-tareeke suza chuke swaminathan ayog kii siforeeshon par amal kii bhi maang karte rahe hai
 Local people had imposed a ban on the entry of government personnel into the village on Tuesday to express support for Anna Hazare's fast
 hajaare ne somvaar ko daawa kiya tha ki bhaajapa ke varisht netaaon ne satta par kabiz hone ke baad lokapal ke gathan kii unki maang se munh pher liya
 He accused the current BJP government of betraying those who voted for him in 2014
 unhone kaha tha, "lokapal or lokayukta par mere ramlila maidan andolan ke dauraan samoochaa desh ekajute ho gaya tha
 An atmosphere was created
 yahi kaaran he ki aap (bhaajapa) satta main aae
 Now you are betraying those who brought you to power
 " Fansi has been sentenced for the murder of a rapist who tried to rape a woman in Iran
 rehana jabbaari ko saat saal jail main bitaane ke baad shanivaar ko faansee de di gai
 Rehana has written an emotional letter to her mother before hanging
 rehana par khufia mantralay ke purv adhikari ke rape karne kii koshish ke dauraan hatya karne kaa aarope he
 Rehana expressed her desire to donate her body parts to her mother after hanging them in the letter
 rehana ne is chitthee main likhaa ki maa ab meri sajaa jhelane kii baari he
 i am embarrassed that today you are sad because of me
 maa aapane jindagi ke aakhri palon main mujhe apane haath chuumane or pita se milane kaa mauka kyon nahin diya
 Referring to the year of the incident, Rihanna wrote that this world gave me the opportunity to live only for 19 years
 us manahuus raat ko mujhe mar janaa chahie tha
 a few days after my death, the police would come and ask you to identify my corpse
 jahaan meri laash dekhne ke baad tumhen ye pataa chalata ki meraa rape bhi ho chukaa he
 Due to lack of power of money, we are not able to reach the guilty
 iske baad aap apni jindagi sangharsh karte hue sharminda hote hue bitaatin or ek din aap bhi insaaf kii ladaai ladate hue mar jaati
 But the story did not stay that night
 main us ghatana ke baad jinda batch gaior mujhe jail kii kabr jaisi salaakhon main kaid kar diya gaya
 Rehana recalls her mother's lessons that death is not the end of life
 maa, aapane hi to kaha tha ki log yahaan anubhav or jindagi ke sabak seekhney aate hai
 Everyone is born to fulfill a responsibility
 maine is jindagi main siikhaa ki aadarshon ke liye hamen ladaai ladani hoti he
 Recalling the childhood experience, Rihanna wrote that in childhood, you tried to improve our small mistakes by telling us
 lekin jab main court room main khadi rahati thi
 Then no lesson in my life worked for me
 court main main ek shaatir apradhi kii tarah pesh kii jaati thi
 There were no tears in my eyes
 jab se mujhe kanoon par bharosa tha, main kisi se koi maafee nahin maangati thi
 Describing the proceedings of the court, Rehana wrote that in the court proceedings, the judge ignored all things
 maa, mere se judi khabaron ko jaanakar aap udhaas mat hona
 On the very first day in jail, a female policeman punished me because of my long beautiful nails
 main usee din is baat ko samaj gai thi ki sundarataa jail ke liye nahin hoti he
 My ideology has changed from the lesson you have taught my mother, but you are not responsible for it
 mere ko sajaa milane ke baad aapako meri haathon se likhaa bahut kuch milegaa
 Which i am leaving for you as my legacy
 chitthee ke aakhri ansh main rehana likhti hai, 'maa ye duniya hamase pyaar nahin karti he
 i am close to embracing death now
 main khuda kii adaalat main jaj, doctor, police tamaam logon ko sajaa dilaavaayuungi
 People who made false accusations against me
 main aise tamaam logon ke khilaaf duniya ke nirmaataa khuda se shikaayat kar insaaf kii maang karuungi
 Mother in that other world you and i will accuse and others will be guilty
 tab ye dekhnaa hoga ki khuda kya chaahate hai
 Mother, i want to hug you till the last breath of life
 main tumse prem karti hum maa

 Rajasthan Administrative Service officer Dheeraj Srivastava has decided to take over as Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi's personal secretary after retiring from government service
 rajasthan ke logon ko is faisle se koi aashcharya nahin hua kyonki rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne apane sabase kareebi adhikari dhiraj shrivastav ko 2003 main satta jate hi tatkaaleen congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke paas laga diya tha
 Despite Dheeraj Shrivastava being an officer of Rajasthan Administrative Service for more than two decades, much of his time has been spent in Congress politics
 sabase pehle ve jodhpur main esadm ban kar aae the
 The then MP of Jodhpur was close to Ashok Gehlot
 apni pehali naukari main us vakt ke sabase taqatvar netaa ke najadik aane kaa phayda dhiraj shrivastav ko unke kariyar main hua
 After that Congress came to power, in 1998 Ashok Gehlot came to Jaipur as the Chief Minister
 mukhyamantri banate hi ashok gahalot ne dhiraj shrivastav ko apana oesady bana diya
 As soon as the Congress went to government between 1999 and 2003, Ashok Gehlot got Dheeraj Shrivastava placed with Sonia Gandhi at that time
 wo manmohan singh sarkaar main pradhanmantri karyaalay main bhi rahe
 At that time there was a discussion among people why Dheeraj Srivastava moved to Delhi
 tab kaha ja rahaa tha ki sarkaar chali gai he or vah ashok gahalot ke sabase bade raajadaar hai
 In such a situation, living here as a state officer, many things could have come to the fore, but Dheeraj Shrivastava did not look back after this
 dhiraj shrivastav vahaan se safar shuru karte hue rajeev gandhi foundation main pahunch gaye
 For a long time, Dheeraj Shrivastava was the OSD of Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 ve lambey samay se rajeev gandhi foundation main hi dilli main pratinidhi ke taur par sevaayen de rahe the
 Gradually he came close to Priyanka Gandhi
 us vakt ve sonia gandhi ke saath-saath priyanka gandhi kaa bhi kaam dekh rahe the
 Very few people know that this is the link due to which Ashok Gehlot runs in the court of Sonia and Priyanka Gandhi
 dhiraj shrivastav kii vajah se hi ashok gahalot kii sonia gandhi or priyanka gandhi ke yahaan sidhi entry he
 Due to this entry, Sachin Pilot could never achieve the number one status in Rajasthan
 dhiraj shrivastav ne is dauraan chote samay ke liye sirohi jalaur or jodhpur main bhi field posting main apni sevaayen di hai magar alp seva ke turant baad inako waapas kendriya pratiniyukti mil jaati thi
 During this time she worked for Women and Child Development, Rural Development, Tribal Development, RTI, MNREGA, Nomadic castes
 2014 main ai baadh ke dauraan bhi unhone behtareen kaam kiya tha
 It is mandatory for you to update KYC of other mobile wallets and payments bank, including Paytm and Airtel Payments Bank

 However he will not be able to add money to his PPI

 In Gujarat, the trends of all 182 assembly seats have come
 bijepi ko bahumat se zyada siten milti dikh rahi he
 However, the Congress did not emerge as strongly as the party had claimed
 par, ye congress ke liye pichley chunaav se bahut behatar mana ja saktaa he
 Much of the credit for the current Congress performance will go to the trio that changed the course of fighting in Gujarat for the first time in the last 22 years
 pichley kuch saalon main gujarat main pehali baar nae tarah kii saamaajik-raajnneetik andolan ko khadaa kiya
 The trio consisted of Hardik Patel, Jignesh Mevani and Alpesh Thakor
 chunaav ke nattejey ab gujarat main is tikdi ke bhavishya or raajnneeti par bhi sawaal karte najar aa rahe hai
 # 1
 hardik ke liye saakh banaae rakhane kii chunauti?patidaar andolan ko khadaa karne or uskaa netritv karne vaale 24 saal ke hardik patel kii saakh daav par thi
 He was considered an alternative to the Patels after Keshubhai in Gujarat
 hardik ne khud chunaav to nahin ladaa, lekin congress kaa purajor samarthan kiya
 His presence with the Congress made the Gujarat battle extremely interesting
 ab jabaki bijepi chhathi baar sarkaar banane main kaamyaab ho gai he, hardik ko apana kad bachaae rakhane kii chunauti kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 The biggest challenge will be the movement created for reservation 'patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti'
 darasal, patidaaron main aarakshan ke mudde par ab pehle jaisaa samarthan hasil karnaa hardik ke liye kaaphi kathin kaary sabit ho saktaa he
 There is already a mutual leadership crisis among the Patidars
 yah andolan kii shuruyaat main dikhaa
 In the election, BJP also succeeded in connecting Hardik's fellow leaders with him
 kahana nahin hoga ki patidaaron ke netritv kaa vikalp bananaa hardik ke liye ek tedi kheer he
 Seats less but bigger than 2012 bjp's victory in Gujarat # 2
 ab kahaan jaaenge jignesh mevanigujrat main jo doosraa sabase bada cheharaa ubharkar saamne aayaa vah jignesh mevani kaa tha
 The 36-year-old Jignesh raised the issue of Dalit oppression in Una as a nationwide movement
 'aazaadee kooch' jaisaa andolan chalaaya
 He opposed this work by uniting the Dalits who disposed of the dead bodies of animals
 jignesh congress main shaamil nahin hue, lekin vidhansabha chunaav main unhone banaaskatha jile kii badgaanv seat se nirdaleey chunaav ladaa or kareeb 18,150 maton ke antar se jeet hasil kii
 Jignesh has emerged as a leader among the Dalits
 jignesh kii raajnneetik yatra par gaur karen to is tarah kii dalit raajnneeti kaa ubhaar gujarat main dekhne ko nahin mili he
 Now it is a big challenge for them to give direction and keep this politics organized after the results
 # 3
 Alpesh Thakor Alpesh Thakor launched a major backward movement in Gujarat
 39 saal ke alpesh ne patidaaron kii obisi aarakshan kii maang kaa virodh kiya or obisi ekta manch banaaya
 Jignesh came along and tried to create obc-dalit politics against the BJP government in Gujarat
 haalanki vidhansabha chunaav se pehle alpesh congress main shaamil ho gaye
 He won the assembly election from Radhanpur on a Congress ticket
 chunki alpesh patidaar andolan kii khilaafat karte aae hai, congress main rahakar unki apni raajnneeti prabhavit ho sakati he
 Rahul's 21 Days in Election: Power of Jhonki in Saurashtra, Central Gujarat # What can happen in the focus of the first phase
 congress ke saath bane rahanaa teenon ke liye phydemand he, par isamen kuch aise pench hai jiske alag dushprabhav bhi hai
 BJP is the face of resistance in all three states, so it is beneficial for them to keep up with alternatives like Congress
 bijepi ke khilaaf do bade or yuva chehre vidhansabha ke andar mukhar honge or hardik ke rup main ek bada cheharaa vidhansabha ke baahar khadaa hoga
 However, the ideological-political confrontation of the three may prove to be a hindrance in this
 darasal, alpesh obisi raajnneeti kaa cheharaa hai
 He has been consistently opposing the Patidars' stake in the OBC quota
 is vakt congress main hai
 Hardik is also with the Congress, but how will the Congress come together in his movement, what will be the attitude of Alpesh towards the Patidar movement and how will Jignesh present a big option for Dalits in Gujarat? It will be interesting to see in the coming days
 kahana nahin hoga ki nateezon ke baad inhen apane samaaj se hi kai tarah ke dabaav kaa saamana karnaa padegaa

 Congress leader has been infuriated by Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar's statement, 'khoda Pahad Nikli Chuhiya, she too died', when Sonia Gandhi was re-elected as Congress President
 maharashtra congress ke kaaryakari adhyaksh nitin raut ne manohar laal khatter ko 'khachchar' kaha he
 He said, Haryana CM Khattar is not a mule '
 nitin raut ne kaha ki aisa bayaan haryana ke siem ko piem modi ke liye dena chahie jinke bare main kaha jaataa tha ki vah desh kii arthvyavastha ko kahaan se kahaan pahunchaa denge lekin hua kya
 Significantly, Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar is seen to be surrounded by a controversial statement
 ravivaar ko sonipat main ek chunavi raily ke dauraan sonia gandhi ko congress kii adhyaksh banaae jane ko lekar ek vivaadaaspad tippanee kii, jise lekar vah aalochana ke shikaar ho rahe hai
 Angry with this comment, the Congress says that this comment shows the 'anti-women' character of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 # WATCH Nitin Raut, Working President, Maharashtra Congress on Haryana Chief Minister ML Khattar's comment on Congress Interim President Sonia Gandhi: Haryana CM isn't Khattar but a 'khacchar'
 pic
 twitter
 com / ys1aznx5ay Manohar Lal Khattar had said, "rahul (rahul Gandhi) left the post of party president after the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections and said that the new Congress president would not belong to the Gandhi family
 
 
 hamane is nirnay kaa swaagat kiya tha
 
 
 It was a good decision to end dynastic politics
 
 
 phir, in logon ne desh bhar main (nae adhyaksh kii) talash shuru kii
 
 
 After three months, he made Sonia Gandhi the Congress President
 
 
 yah to aisa hua, jaise khoda pahaad, nikali chuhia, vah bhi mari hui
 
 
 "on this statement of Khattar, the Congress has demanded that the Chief Minister of Haryana apologize for this comment
 congress ne hindi main kiye twit main kaha, "BJP ke mukhyamantri dwaara diya gaya bayaan na keval ashobhaneey or nimnastareey he, balki yah BJP ke mahila-virdohi charitra ko bhi darshata he
 
 
 We condemn the Chief Minister's statement and demand his apology at the earliest
 
 
 " akhil bhartiya mahila congress kii pramukh sushmita dev ne somvaar ko kaha ki is 'asansadeey evam nindaneey' bayaan ke liye bina shart maafee maangani chahie
 He issued a statement saying, "I condemn Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar's remarks against Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 '' sushmita ne kaha, '' unki tippanee asansadeey or nindaneey he
 This reflects his and bjp's abusive attitude towards women
 ' Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who has been the target of critics after his embarrassing 1-2 defeat in the Test series at the hands of England, refused to comment on the discussion about appointing a separate captain for a different format
 dhoni se jab sthaneey patrkaar ne is sambandh main chal rahi charchaa ke bare main poocha to unka sidhaa jawaab tha, aapkaa sawaal mujhe lagata he ki alag praaroop ke liye alag captain se judaa he, lekin abhi twanti-20 praaroop kii baat karen, kyonki guuruuvaar ko hamen tii-20 match khelnaa he
 Dhoni wanted to get rid of this issue and the proof of this was found again when he responded in the same strict manner to the British journalist
 bhartiya captain ne kaha, is mahatvapurn shrunkhlaa ke shuru hone se pehle main is par tippanee nahin karnaa chahta tha
 Because when everything is not favorable when it comes to Indian cricket, questions start to arise about captaincy, senior players, junior players and the skills and bench strength that we have
 kai tarah ke sawaal khadey kar die jate hai or yadi aap sabhi kaa jawaab dene lago to mujhe lagata he ki hamaare paas samay kii kami pad jaaegi
 Dhoni also tried to avoid tough questions about India's failure
 unhone kaha, meraa hameshaa se yahi kahana rahaa he ki jo ho gaya us par baat karne kaa koi matlab nahin banataa
 Whether we win or we have lost
 vartmaan ke bare main sochna zyada mahatvapurn hota he tathaa aagaamee praaroop bahut alag he
 It is important to pay attention to that
 dhoni ne kaha, yah puri tarah se alag tarah kaa praaroop he isliye mujhe nahin lagata ki test shrunkhlaa se kuch lekar aage badhane kaa koi matlab hoga
 It is a completely different kind of format
 bhartiya captain ne haalanki kaha ki haar ke baavjood test shrunkhlaa main unke kuch sakaaratmak paksh bhi rahe
 He said, it was disappointing that we could not win the series and after a long time we could not do it
 lekin (nagpur main khele gaye) aakhri test match main hamane acha pradarshan kiya
 The wicket was very flat
 (shrunkhlaa ke) phir bhi kuch sakaaratmak pahalu rahe
 The comments dhoni ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki cheteshwar pujaara hamaara bhavishya he
 He and Virat Kohli performed well
 aapane dekha hoga ki gendbaajon visheshkar spinneron ne acha pradarshan kiya jabaki unhen wicket se bahut adhik madad nahin mil rahi thi
 Dhoni said that after the draw in Nagpur, senior batsman Sachin Tendulkar did not give any indication about his future
 unhone kaha, nahin aisa kuch nahin he
 The Indian captain said that it is difficult to reconcile the T20 format to the Test as soon as possible, but professional players are expected to do so
 unhone kaha, test cricket tii-20 se puri tarah se bhinn hota he, lekin antarrashtriya cricketer hone ke naate hamen khel kii maang ke anuroop chalanaa padataa he
 Another practice session would have helped, but we only got one day to practice
 isliye hamane iskaa adhik se adhik phayda uthaane kii koshish kii
 Dhoni said dew will also play a role, which reduces the impact of spinners
 unhone kaha, praaroop koi bhi ho england kii team santulit he
 The circumstances are slightly different at this time of the year
 is samay os padati he, jiskaa matlab he ki spinner adhik prabhaav nahin chhod paaenge, lekin ye sab kayaas hai
 The Indian captain said, "I didn't want to comment on this before the start of this important series
" kyonki jab bhartiya cricket kii baat hoti he, yadi sab kuch anukool nahin hua to captaini, senior khilaadiyon, junior khilaadiyon or hamaare paas maujuud kaushal or bench strength ko lekar sawaal uthne shuru ho jate hai
 Many kinds of questions are raised and if you start answering all of them then i think we will be short of time
 dhoni ne bharat kii asafalataa se jude kade sawaalon se bhi bachane kii koshish kii
 He said, i have always said that it makes no sense to talk about what happened
 chaahe ham jite hon yaa hamen haar mili he
 It is more important to think about the present and the upcoming format is very different
 us par dhyaan dena mahatvapurn he
 Dhoni said, "it is a completely different format so i don't think it would make sense to move forward with anything from the Test series
" yah puri tarah se alag tarah kaa praaroop he
 However, the Indian captain said that despite the defeat, he also had some positive sides in the Test series
 unhone kaha, yah niraashajanak rahaa ki ham shrunkhlaa nahin jeet paae or lambey arse baad ham aisa nahin kar paae
 But we played well in the last Test match (played in Nagpur)
 wicket kaaphi sapaat tha
 (of the series) Nevertheless there were some positive aspects
 tippaniyan Dhoni said, i think Cheteshwar Pujara is our future
 unhone or viraat kohli ne acha pradarshan kiya
 You may have noticed that the bowlers, especially the spinners, performed well even though they were not getting much help from the wicket
 dhoni ne kaha ki nagpur main drow chute match ke baad senior ballebaaj sachin tendulkar ne apane bhavishya ko lekar koi sanket nahin die
 He said, no, there is nothing like that
 bhartiya captain ne kaha ki test se tii-20 ke praaroop main jald se jald saamanjasy bithaana mushkil hota he, lekin peshewar khilaadiyon se aisi ummid kii jaati he
 He said, Test cricket is completely different from T20, but as international cricketers we have to follow the demands of the game
 ek or abhyaas satr se madad milti, lekin hamen abhyaas ke liye keval ek din mila
 So we tried to make the most of it
 dhoni ne kaha ki os bhi bhoomika nibhaayegi, jisase spinneron kaa prabhaav kam ho jaataa he
 England's team is balanced no matter the format
 varsh ke is samay main paristhitiyaan thodi bhinn hoti hai
 At this time there is dew, which means that the spinners will not be able to leave much impact, but these are all speculations
 dhoni ne kaha, yah puri tarah se alag tarah kaa praaroop he isliye mujhe nahin lagata ki test shrunkhlaa se kuch lekar aage badhane kaa koi matlab hoga

 raashtrapati donald trump jaanate hai ki rus ke saath ‘‘behatar sambandh’’ america ke hit main he or isliye vah purvavarti prashasan se itar rus ke saath mithravat sambandh chaahate hai jabaki obama prashasan is tarah ke prayaas main naakaam rahaa tha
 White House press secretary Sean Spicer said, "I think there is a slight difference in the president's desire that he understand that a better relationship with Russia can help us in the end of ISIS and terrorism all over the world
" obama prashasan ne rus ke saath sambandh sudhaarney kii koshish to kii, lekin wo naakaam rahe
 '' spicer ne kaha, ‘‘unhone rus ko bataane kii koshish kii ki kreemia par akraman nahin karen, lekin naakaam rahe
 The current president understands that a comfortable relationship is in America's national and economic interests
 agar putin or rus ke saath unke behatar rishte hai to yah acha he or agar aisa nahin hota he to vah is disha main aage badhenge
 "he said that but he is not ready to just accept that it was not possible in the past
" tippaniyan Spicer strongly denied that Trump was soft on Russia
 unhone kaha ki raashtrapati ne yah spasht kiya he ki unhen ummid he ki rus sarkaar ukraine main hinsa kam karegi or kreemia ko waapas lautaayegi
 "on the other hand, he is also hopeful about this and on the contrary he wants better relations with Russia unlike the previous administration so that many such problems of the world like ISIS and terrorism can be resolved together
" ’’ baharhaal, vipakshi democratic party ke netaaon ne rus par kathith rup se naram ravaiye ko lekar trump kii aalochana kii he
 Spicer said, "he tried to tell Russia not to attack Crimea, but failed
 maujuuda raashtrapati yah samajhate hai ki sahaj sambandh america ke rashtriya or aarthik hit main he
 If he has better relations with Putin and Russia then it is good and if it does not, then he will move in this direction
 ’’ unhone kaha ki lekin vah sirf ye baat maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai ki ateet main aisa hona sambhav nahin tha
 The comments spicer ne dridhtaa se is baat kaa khandan kiya ki trump rus ko lekar naram hai
 He said that the President made it clear that he hoped that the Russian government would reduce violence in Ukraine and return to Crimea
 unhone kaha, ‘‘duusari ore unhen is baat kii bhi puri ummid he or vah purvavarti prashasan ke vipareet rus ke saath behatar sambandh chaahate hai taaki iesas or aatankwaad jaisi duniya kii aisi kai samasyaon kaa milakar samaadhaan kiya ja sake
 However, Trump has been criticized by leaders of the opposition Democratic Party for their alleged leniency on Russia

 kathmandu main bharat or pakistan donon ke pradhanmantri saarc sabha se sahyog kii baaten karte rahe, lekin khud mulaakaat se bachate rahe
 Leave the meeting, do not try to come in one frame and kept trying hard
 30 saal baad saarc agar do padosiyon ko ek mez par aamane-saamne nahin laa saktaa to kya wo ek or baar fail nahin hua
 Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi said that the boundaries of boundaries are against progress
 soshal media ke daur main simaaen matter nahin karti hai
 a sense of integration integration is emerging around the world
 saarc nakaaratmakataa or ndehwaad kaa shikaar rahaa he
 While this area is shirking with the optimism of the youth
 ham bangko singapore aasaani se ja sakate hai, lekin saarc deshon ke bich aana-janaa mushkil he
 Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif also more or less talks that SAARC is the center of aspirations for peace, progress and prosperity of the people of this region
 is ilaake kii aabaadi kaa ek bata paanchvaan hissaa 15 se 24 saal ke bich he yani yuva he
 My aim is to have a dispute-free South Asia
 jahaan ek duusare se ladane ke bajaae ham milakar garibi, nirakshartaa, beemaari, kuposhan par kaam kar saken
 Together we should eradicate poverty, malnutrition unemployment in rural areas

 Did not tell what she is doing
 lekin nawaz sharif ne kaha ki pakistan dakshin asia, madhya asia or pashchim asia ke liye swaabhaavik rup se koridor ban jaataa he
 The Prime Minister of India also talked about improving traffic
 balki ve khud sweekaar bhi kar rahe the ki bhartiya simaaon par sampark maarg behad kharaab hai jise ve jaldi thik karne ja rahe hai
 He also said that Indian companies invest worldwide, but less than one percent in SAARC regions
 donon ke bhaashan kaa makasad itnaa adarshavaadi tha ki sunate hue laga ki bhaashan khatm karte hi donon saarc kii yuva peedi ke liye lunch par milane vaale hai
 But both of them did not even mention about each other properly
 piem modi ne kaha ki aaj ek punjab se duusare punjab main jab koi saamaan chalata he, dilli, mumbai, dubai or karachi hokar jaataa he
 Travels 11 times longer and becomes four times more expensive
 soch kar dekhiye ki ham apane upabhoktaaon ke saath kar kya rahe hai
 We have to reduce the distance between the producer and the consumer
 vyapaar kaa diarect root bananaa hoga
 i know that India will have to lead and we will play our role
 ab yahaan rashtrawaad upabhoktavaad ke saanche main dhal kar bhi gharelu raajnneetik dabaavon se nahin batch paaya
 On the one hand, the Prime Minister's consumerism is free from the confines of borders, on the other hand his nationalism is caught in the border dispute where he has stopped talking to Pakistan due to the events
 narendra modi ne kaha ki saarc ke taur par ham apane logon kii aakankshaon ke saath chalane main fail rahe hai
 Is it because we hide behind the walls of our differences and inhibitions
 ham ateet kii parchaai se baahar nahin aa rahe hai
 This will not resolve the differences, but we will surely miss the opportunity
 to phir pradhanmantri ko matbhedon kii deevaaron ke peeche se saamne aane main koun roak rahaa he
 If someone is stopping then he was not mentioned in his speech
 unke bhaashan main ej of bijness to tha magar ej aaf polytics nahin tha
 If the heart and mind of the Prime Minister says that we should not miss the opportunity, should they not have taken a new risk for india-pakistan relations by taking the risk one more time
 ve apane achche bhaashan ko bhi to avasar main badal hi sakate the
 Or is there also a meaning of his speech that he was now insisting on improving relations with other SAARC countries by ignoring Pakistan
 nawaz sharif to saarc ke abjavarr china kii bhoomika or raay ko mahatvapurn bataane lage
 India rejected it outright
 bhaashan main to iskaa zikr nahin tha, lekin narendra modi ne kaha ki ve is ilaake main sambandhon kii behatari ke liye kya karne ja rahe hai
 India will give business visas of three to five years to merchants from SAARC countries
 saarc vyapaariyon ko bijness traveler card milina chahie
 India will give medical visas to patients from SAARC countries
 marij or uske saath ek sahyogi ko
 The PM also said that there is a balance of trade in India's favor in this area and they are aware of it
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki bharat sabko level plaing field degaa
 That means everyone will get an opportunity
 saarc desh apane yahaan bhartiya nivesh ko badhaava de
 The Hindu newspaper reported on 3 December 2012 that India has entered into liberalized visa regime agreements with Bangladesh under which concessions would be granted to visas to senior citizens, students and patients of Bangladesh
 isi report main yah bhi likhaa he ki bharat ne pakistan ke saath bhi udaar visa system par qaraar kiya he
 The agreement has been made but the effect on the ground is not visible
 iske tahat tirthayatriyon or sailaaniyon ko vishesh visa die jane kii baat thi
 Under this, there was talk of granting businessmen a visa allowing entry to many cities
 senior citijan ko visa dene kii baat thi
 Could not gather information about the situation now

 By Wednesday evening, Sartaj Aziz, Advisor on Foreign Affairs of the Prime Minister of Pakistan from Kathmandu, said that Pakistan is ready for talks
 bharat pahal kare
 Nawaz Sharif said the same before leaving for Kathmandu
 kathmandu main bharat ke pradhanmantri ne kaha ki ve hamen jaanate hai or pahachaanate bhi hai
 Everyone was meeting each other there, only the Prime Minister of India and Pakistan were not meeting each other
 jab donon yuvaaon se aahvaan kar rahe hai, yuva aabaadi kii kasame khaakar kah rahe the ki inke liye kshetra ko jodna zaruri he to kya ye un yuvaaon se nahin kah sakate the ki kshetra tabhi judega jab ham baatcheet karenge
 Is the SAARC Conference a platform for making a good speech or is India now turning this platform in another direction, where it wants to improve relations with other countries faster by leaving Pakistan free
 kahin aisa to nahin ki bharat or pakistan hi apane sambandhon ke kootnithik khel main saarc ke uddeshy ko daanv par laga rahe hai yaa aaj bharat ne pakistan ko saarc deshon ke bich puri tarah se haashiye par laa diya

 Do you know that the soldiers of our army can beat the enemy even without weapons or the army has the ability to see even in the dark night
 
 
 shaayad aap yah bhi nahin jaanate honge ki hamaari sena sarhad paar ke dushmano se zyada sarhar ke bheetar ke shatruon se jujh rahi he
 And you might not even know that there are good singers, musicians, lyricists and doctors in the army

 In the morning, people learned the tricks of being healthy with military vigor with the soldiers
 logon main utsaah bharne ke liye sena ke javaanon ne marshall arts ke paitaren bhi dikhaae
 The personnel of the Assam Regiment showed martial arts of their area, the Madras Regiment of Kalriyappayattu and the Punjab Regiment showed through Gatka how enemies could be killed in an instant without weapons
 mahilaayein apane aapako kaise surakshit rakh sakati hai iske bhi tareeke sikhaye gaye
 When the jawans came forward, how would the dog squad that followed them stay behind all the time
 inhonen bhi apane kartab se sabakaa man moh liya
 For information here, let us know that due to these dogs, army soldiers have been successful in many missions and they have also received medals for bravery
 ummid he ki 15 janvari se pehle aise or bhi kaarykram dilli ke alag alag hisson main kiye ja sakate hai
 By the way, if you get a chance, you can also come to see the Delhi Cantt Parade on 15 January without any ticket
 yahaan par aap dekh sakate he ki aapaki sena ke paas kaise kaise hathiyaar he
 
 kitne josh se bharpoor hai sena ke jawan or agar dushman hamalaa karne kii gustaakhee karen to ve kaise use muhthod jawaab dete hai
 The army is always standing with us, so why should we not be present on its anniversary and encourage the soldiers and tell them that people are equally concerned about their happiness

 5 saal ke noah ne itane dilachasp andaaj main baat kii ki log is video ko utyub par baar-baar dekh rahe hai

 uskaa andaaj bhi bilkul reporter jaisaa hi tha
 When Sophia asked Noa about her ride experience, her answer was like, 'it was great and frankly I've never been on live TV before
 lekin spasht rup se tivi par maine kabhi news nahin dekhi
 Because i am a kid and obviously every time Grandpa gives me the remote, i have to watch the powerball
 mujhe bahut majaa aa rahaa tha, kyonki spasht rup se aap is ride ke dauraan ek gol chakre main gum rahe hote hai or spasht rup se har baar aapako chakkar aane jaisaa mahasoos hota he
 According to Noa's grandfather, Noa has a good knowledge of words and is extremely talkative

 The Doklam dispute has started reverberating with China's Sinajori
 chini sena ke bharat ko sabak lene kii naseehat ke baad ab bharat ke rajdoot gautam bambaawale ne kaha he ki is maamle ko bevajaah badha-chadhaakar pesh kiya ja rahaa he

 Asked whether the deadlock over the Doklam issue has affected the relationship between the two countries, he said, "I believe you are presenting it exaggeratedly
" hamaare rishte main aise choti-moti baadhaon se paar paane ke liye bharat or china ke log or hamaare netaa kaaphi anbhavi or samajhadaar hai
 Gautam said, "I believe that in the period after the Doklam incident, India and China need to keep talking to each other at different levels, including at the leadership level and communicate more than before

 The soldiers of India and China were face to face for 73 days from 16 June last year
 is kshetra main chini sena kii ore se kiye ja rahe sadak nirmaan ke kaam ko bhartiya paksh ne roak diya tha jiske baad yah gatirodh shuru hua tha
 Quoting General Rawat's statement, Wu had said that i want to emphasize that whatever shape a country has, it should be treated equally

 '' When Mulayam Singh made Shivpal Yadav the state president, the youth organizations of the party took to the streets against him
 ve shivpal yadav ko hataakar akhilesh yadav ko adhyaksh banane kii maang kar rahe the
 State President of Samajwadi Lohia Vahini, Pradeep Tiwari has written in his letter to Mulayam that "from the day Shivpal Yadav became the state president, the youth of the entire state are feeling suffocated
 or aaj naujavaanon ke upar hui karrwai akhilesh yadav ke bhavishya par bada hamalaa he
 '' Comments pradeep tiwari akhilesh yadav ke alaava kisi ko netaa maanane ko taiyaar bhi nahin hai
 They say, "this is a big conspiracy with us youngsters
" ham noujvaan apana netaa sirf or sirf akhilesh yadav ji ko maanate hai
 Will work under his leadership
 '' This is a new era of socialism, which is not society-oriented
 
 
 vyakti pradhan he
 Some are soft men

 ’ Recently, the trailer of Salman Khan and Sohail Khan's upcoming film Tubelight has been launched
 salmaan khan kii is film ne trailor launch ke baad kaaphi surkhiyaan batori
 But as usual, KRK could not stop himself from giving his review after watching the trailer of this film
 bollywood kii koi film ho yaa controvarsi, kamaal raashid khan unpar apane caments jarur dete hai
 Whether 'bahubali 2' or 'sachin: a Billion Dreams' KRK has expressed its reviews on every film
 phir bhala wo ‘tubalite’ ko kaise chhod dete ?'tubalite' kaa trailor dekhne ke baad KRK ne bade hi mithe shabdon main negative caments die hai
 First of all, he praised Salman Khan and said that he is a very big fan of him and due to Salman's great stardom, this film will also earn well
 par 'tubalite' kaa trailor unhen kuch khaas nahin laga
 Twinkle's tweet on PERIODS, KRK said- 'bhabhi ji' then went on to target Sohail Khan, saying that none of his previous films had any effect on the big screen and especially when the two Khan brothers together work done
 ‘god tussi great ho’ kii baat karte hue unhone is baat kaa saboot diya
 My review of # tubelighttrailerhttps: / / t
 co / wbtnuo9dqnvia@youtube— KRK (@kamaalrkhan)may 27, 2017haalanki ye koi pehali baar nahin jab KRK ne aise rivyus die hai
 Earlier, he also gave 4 points to Arjun Kapoor and Shraddha Kapoor's 'half Girlfriend'
 jabaki 'bahubali 2' kii kaaphi aalochana kii thi
 KRK trolls Sachin's film, said- i can't afford it
 The trailer of 'tubelight' was launched on May 25, which also gained immense popularity on the basis of Salman and Shah Rukh Khan in the film
 'tubalite' is saal kii bahupratikshit filmon main se ek maani ja rahi he or ye salmaan or kabir khan kii ‘ek tha tiger’ or ‘bajrangi bhaijan’ ke baad saath main teesri film he
 Many film experts have even said that it can break the record of 'bahubali'
 pakistan main pal rahe aatankiyon ke khilaaf air strike ke baad 2016 jaisaa raajnneetik maahaul najar aa rahaa he, jab sena ne pioke main ghuskar sargical strike kii or vipakshi dalon ne uske saboot maang liye
 The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party criticized this attitude of the opposition as suspicious of the military's valor and might
 or takreeban dhai saal baad june 2018 main sargical strike ke video jari kar die the
 After the terrorist attack in Uri, Special Commandos of the Indian Army entered the Pakistan border on the night of 28-29 September 2016 and attacked the terrorists
 javaanon kii is jambaaji kaa tatkaaleen dijiemo (DGMO) leftinent general ranbir singh ne baqayada press conference kar elaan kiya
 The tough decision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who took revenge on the martyrdom of the soldiers by entering into Pakistan's border, also started and the government's courage with the army was also appreciated
 lekin iske baad jald hi vipaksh ne sarkaar se strike ke saboot maang liye
 On October 4, 2016, Maharashtra Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam termed the surgical strike as fake
 sanjay nirupam ne kaha tha ki har bhartiya pakistan ke khilaaf sargical strike chahta he, lekin bijepi dwaara raajnneetik laabh uthaane ke liye farji (sargical strike) nahin
 Apart from Sanjay Nirupam, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also called the surgical strike a result of the bravery of the army and the will power of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said that PM Modi should stop the propaganda being carried out regarding the surgical strike
 kejariwal ne video sandesh main kaha ki pakistan antarrashtriya patrakaron ko le ja rahaa he or ye dikhaane kii koshish kar rahaa he ki sargical strike to hui hi nahin
 Prime Minister, expose this propaganda of Pakistan
 isi tarah purv videsh mantri or congress netaa pi
 Chidambaram demanded that the video of the surgical strike should be released
 video jari bhi kiya gaya, lekin usase pehle bijepi netaaon ne 2017 kii shuruyaat main hue paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav main sargical strike kaa jamkar apane bhaashanon main istemaal kiya
 Especially in UP, this was also seen from the posters put up by the BJP leaders on the streets
 upi vidhansabha chunaav prachaar ke dauraan pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi pakistan ko munhtod jawaab dene vaale vaakya apane bhaashanon main istemaal kiye
 At a rally in Meerut on 5 February 2017, PM Modi said that his government has entered Pakistan and paid the accounts of the pie
 duusari taraf, yogi adityanath ne janvari 2017 kii gorakhpur raily main kaha tha ki upi main is baar bijepi kii purna bahumat kii sarkaar banegaa or agali sargical strike hafiz said par kii jaaegi
 Apart from the statements, posters of PM Modi and the then Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar were also seen on the streets of UP along with the slogan of the surgical strike
 march 2017 main jab chunaav ke nattejey aae to upi main bijepi ne itihaas rach diya
 a total of seven states held elections in 2017, out of which the BJP government was formed everywhere except Punjab
 iske baad june 2018 main saboot ke taur par video jari kiya gaya
 Revenge, Airstrike and Proof of Pulwama After the suicide terror attack in Pulwama on 14 February, the opposition has started asking for evidence on the airstrike done by the Air Force on 26 February
 sabase pehle 28 farvari ko pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri banerjee ne kaha ki antarrashtriya media main airstrike se koi nuksaan na hone kii khabar aa rahi hai, aise main piem modi vipaksh ko bataaen ki kahaan bam giraae gaye or kitne aatanki maare gaye
 On March 3, CPI leader D
 raja ne bhi aise hi sawaal khadey kiye or poocha ki bhartiya media main 200-300 aatankiyon ke maare jane kaa aankada kahaan se aayaa?congress kii taraf varisht netaa kapil sibbal, pi
 Chidambaram, Digvijay Singh, Navjot Singh Sidhu and MP Ajay Singh have also raised questions
 congress netaa bhi antarrashtriya media kaa hawala de rahe hai
 On March 4, Kapil Sibal made a tweet and asked if any damage coming to the international media is pro-pakistani? However, p
 chidambaram ne kaha he ki ham military par sawaal nahin kar rahe hai, balki ye kah rahe hai ki pulavama hamale ke baad piem modi puure maamle kaa raajnneetikaran kar rahe hai
 Now that the Lok Sabha elections are near and campaigning is going on, the Bharatiya Janata Party leader and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are giving speeches in the rallies, questioning the figures of the terrorists, doubting the bravery of the army
 patna ke gandhi maidan main bijepi kii sankalp raily main ravivaar ko pradhanmantri ne kaha ki jab desh ko ek aawaaj main bolne kii aavashyaktaa he tab 21 raajnneetik dal hamaari ninda karne vaale prastaav ko apnaane ke liye dilli main ekatra ho gaye or vah sashastr balon se unki bahaduree kaa saboot maang rahe hai
 That is, after the surgical strike, the way the BJP made the opposition's questions the basis of their criticism, the same is seen after the air strike

 Significantly, the Uttar Pradesh Cabinet Minister Om Prakash Rajbhar had justified the Supreme Court's decision on SC / ST Act and asked the Central Government to reconsider the issue to save the people from this draconian law
 unhone kaha tha ki vah nyaayalay ke nirnay kaa puraa samarthan karte hai, kyonki yah ek bade varg ke logon ke liye kiya gaya sahi nirnay he
 Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party President had claimed in a media interaction that the SC / ST Act was being misused and the central government should revisit the issue to save people from this draconian law
 bataa den kiucchtam nyaayalay ne ek faisle ke jariye essi-asti adhinium ke tahat maamle main swat: giraftaar par roak laga di thi
 This decision of the court was seen by some part of the society as a dilution of the provisions of the law
 isko lekar essi-asti samudaay ne bharat band kaa aahvaan kiya tha, jisamen desh ke vibhinn hisson main hinsa kii ghatnaayen dekhne ko mili thim
 The government overturned the court's decision by passing a bill to amend the SC-ST law in the monsoon session of Parliament to address the concerns of the community

 aam aadmi party ke saansad bhagwant maan ne korum na puraa hone kaa mudda sadan main uthaaya, jiske baad dipti spikar ne kaha ki aaj gaiyr sarkari kaam kaaj kaa din he
 But Mann said that not only the ruling party but also the mps of the opposition parties are absent from the House

 Meanwhile, AAP MP Bhagwant Mann said that quorum is not complete in the house
 unhone kaha ki na sirf sattadhari dal ke saansad balki vipakshi saansad bhi sadan main nahin he
 Maan asked where is Congress, where is TMC
 iske baad sadan main korum wel bajaai gai
 Bhagwant Mann raised the issue, BJP MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy, on behalf of the Mudasattadhari party, explained to Man that the Union Minister was sitting in the House
 saath hi sattapaksh kii ore se kaha gaya ki privet member bill ke dauraan korum kaa mudda maan ko nahin uthaanaa chahie
 By raising this, he is questioning not only the ruling party but also his fellow opposition

 The Deputy Speaker then told the House that the quorum was not complete and the proceedings of the House are adjourned

 On Wednesday, in a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs, it was decided that the government would take the lead in this direction prominently during the budget session
 endie sarkaar pehle hi tay kar chuki he ki sabhi adhyadeshon ko kanoon main badalane se judi kanoonee aupchaariktaayen 1 farvari tak puri kar lee jaaengi jisase kii bajet satr ke shuru hone tak sabhi mantralay puri tarah se taiyaar ho jaaen
 The cabinet committee decided on Wednesday that the budget session be called this time on 23 February

 The first phase of the budget session will be from 23 February to 20 March

 lekin aaj bada sawaal ye he ki kya vipaksh iske liye taiyaar hoga? haal ke dinon main zamin adhigrahan adhyadesh ke masale par vipaksh phir lamaband hota dikh rahaa he
 Congress, JD-U and Left leaders appeared on the same platform in Delhi on Monday on the question of acquiring thousands of acres of land for the new capital of Andhra Pradesh
 mushkil ye he ki raashtrapati ke aagaah karne ke baad endie sarkaar adhyadesh ko kanoon main badalane kii disha main tezi se aage badhanaa chaahati he, jabaki vipakshi dal iske khilaaf lamaband ho rahe hai
 In such a situation, in the absence of a majority in the Rajya Sabha, making political consensus on important bills of the NDA government can prove to be a very difficult challenge

 According to Sushant's team, the driver was also calling Sushant's driver very bad, so Sushant started making videos of him so that he could run away from fear

 According to Sushant's team, no abusive speech was done on his behalf

 After the decision to create a separate Telangana state in Andhra Pradesh, the demand for separate states in other parts of the country has started gaining momentum and in the same sequence violence started in Assam demanding separate Karbi Anglong and Bodoland state and Two people were killed in police firing
 aaj kokarajhaar or bongigaanv main bodoland kii maang par rail roko pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Hundreds of people have sat on the tracks

 On the other hand, large-scale arson has spread in the violence in Diphu, after which the army was called here

 The debate about the Uniform Civil Code has started once again in the country
 yah charchaa aise samay main ho rahi he jab aage upi or chaar anya rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 The Law Ministry has written a letter to the Law Commission, seeking opinion on the implementation of Uniform Civil Code in the country
 uttar pradesh kii siyasat main laa saktaa he tufanvaise to 2014 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye bijepi ke ghoshnaa patr main samaan naagarik samhita kaa mudda bhi shaamil tha, lekin upi vidhansabha chunaav se pehle bijepi ne jis tarah se is par jami dhul ko saaf karne kii koshish kii he, usase sawaal bhi khadey hote hai or vivaad bhi
 Protests from the Muslim community are being decided on this issue
 kuch sanghathanon ne ise vot bank kii raajnneeti ke liye bijepi kaa nayaa pintara bhi bataaya he
 It is also considered an issue raised in UP for the purpose of polarization of Hindus
 uthati rahi hai virodh kii awajenaisa pehali baar nahin he jab desh main har samudaay ke liye ek jaisaa kanoon or niyam laane kii baat or us par virodh hua ho
 Whenever the discussion of this rule has been waged by any government or party, there have been swords of protest from different sections
 1951 main bhi jab biaar ambedkar or tatkaaleen pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru ne hindu samaaj ke liye hindu code bill laane kii koshish kii to na sirf iske khilaaf awaajen uthin, balki sirf ek dharm vishesh ke liye aisa kanoon laane par sawaal uthaae
 Apart from this, disputes over the Common Civil Code have also been hot
 uniform civil code aakhir he kya?uniform civil code kaa matlab he desh main har naagarik ke liye ek samaan kanoon kaa hona
 Then even if he belongs to any religion or caste
 philhal desh main alag-alag majahabon ke liye alag-alag personal lau hai
 The implementation of the Uniform Civil Code will bring the same law for every religion
 yani muslamaanon ko bhi teen shaadiyaan karne or patni ko mahaj teen baar talaak bole dene se rishta khatm kar dene vaali parampara khatm ho jaaegi
 Not only this, the same rules will also be applicable in cases like the right of women to their father's property and adoption
 jab-jab civil code ko lekar bahes chhidi he, virodhiyon ne yahi kaha he ki ye sabhi dharmon par hindu kanoon ko lagu karne jaisaa he
 Uniform civil code means bringing uniformity in the personal law of every religion
 iske tahat har dharm ke kanoonon main sudhaar or ekarupata laane par kaam hoga
 The meaning of the Union Civil Code is an impartial law, which has nothing to do with any religion
 kyon he jaruri?- vibhinn dharmon ke vibhinn kanoon se nyaaypalika par boj padataa he
 The coming of the Common Civil Code will get rid of this difficulty and the cases pending in the courts for years will be settled soon
 - sabhi ke liye kanoon main ekasmanta se ekta ko badhaava milegaa or is baat main koi do raay nahin he ki jahaan har naagarik samaan ho, us desh vikaas teji se hota he
 - The condition of Muslim women will be better
 - bharat kii chhavi ek dharmanirpeksh desh kii he
 In such a situation, law and religion should have nothing to do with each other
 sabhi logon ke saath dharm se pare jaakar samaan vyavhaar hona jaruri he
 - The implementation of uniform law on every Indian will also change the politics or you can say that the politics of vote bank and polarization will be curbed
 kya chhin jayega logon kaa dharmik adhikaar?aisa nahin he ki samaan naagarik samhita lagu hone se logon ko apni dharmik manyataon ko maanane kaa adhikaar chhin jayega
 Article 44 of the Constitution favors the Uniform Civil Code, but these are directive principals
 yani ise lagu karnaa yaa na karnaa puri tarah se sarkaar par nirbhar karata he
 The Common Civil Code is applicable in Goa
 duusari taraf samvidhan ke anuchhed 25 or 29 kahati hai ki kisi bhi varg ko apni dharmik manyataon or reeti-rivaajon ko maanane kii puri aazaadee he
 With the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code, people of all religions will be brought under the ambit of the same law, which will cover matters like marriage, divorce, property and adoption
 ye logon ko kanoonee aadhaar par majboot banayega
 The Hindu Code Bill was introduced in India for Hindu personal laws
 desh main jabardast virodh ke baad is bill ko chaar hisson main baant diya gaya tha
 Jawaharlal Nehru, the then Prime Minister, put it in Hindu Marriage Act, Hindu Succession Act, Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act and Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act
 Was divided
 is kanoon ne mahilaon ko sidhe taur par shashakt banaaya
 Under these, women get rights in ancestral and husband's property
 iske alaava alag-alag jatiyon ke logon ko ek-duusare se shaadi karne kaa adhikaar he lekin koi vyakti ek shaadi ke rahete duusari shaadi nahin kar saktaa
 What Muslim personal law says: Under Muslim personal law, a husband can divorce his wife only three times by saying divorce
 agar ye donon phir se shaadi karnaa chaahate hai to mahila ko pehle kisi or purush ke saath shaadi rachaani hogi, uske saath shaareerik sambandh banane honge or usase talaak lene ke baad hi wo pehle pati se phir shaadi kar sakati he
 In this law, women are not given any right to any allowance or property from the husband after divorce, but the law of payment
 talaak lene ke baad muslim purush turant shaadi kar saktaa he lekin mahila ko 4 maheene 10 din kaa intjaar karnaa padataa he
 The personal law of Christians is important in the personal law of Christians against women
 ek shaadishuda jode ko talaak ke liye do saal tak alag rahanaa jaruri hota he
 Apart from this, the girl has no right over the property of the mother
 desh main kuch aise kanoonee maamle bhi hue hai, jo na sirf sidhe taur par civil code se taalluk rakhte hai balki isaki jarurat kaa ahsaas bhi karaate hanshah bano cese ahmaye ek aisa maamla tha, jisane desh kii raajnneeti main bada bhuuchaal laa diya tha
 The Rajiv Gandhi government brought the Muslim Women Act, 1986 to change the decision of the Supreme Court in this case
 1978 main indore kii rahane vaali 62 saal kii muslim mahila shah bano ko uske pati ne talaak de diya tha
 The elderly mother of 5 approached the Supreme Court to get alimony and fought a long legal battle
 1985 main supreme court ne uske haq main faisla sunaaya
 When the All India Muslim Personal Law Board opposed the decision, the then Congress government came up with a new Act, which despite winning the case, Shah Bano could not get his rights
 is cese ne desh main muslim mahilaon kii sthiti par sawaal khadey kar die the
 Over 90 per cent Muslim women have been facing protests against triple talaq over the past few years, with many cases of divorce of Muslim women through letters, e-mails, messages, whatsapp and Skype
 jaahir he, viksit ho rahe samaaj main mahilaon kii sthiti aaj bhi ghar kii dahalij ke andar isse anchhui he
