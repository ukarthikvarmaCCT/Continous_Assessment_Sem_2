 The loksabhaa chunaav (lok sabha Election) ke dauraan kharaab mashil par koi bhi batan dabaane se bhaajapa ko vot jane kii khabaron kaa chunaav ayog ne khandan kiya he
 a senior official of the Goa Election Commission (goa) Election Commission said that such news is being publicized to mislead people, whereas there is no such thing
 bataa den ki kuch din pehle aisi khabaren saamne ai thi ki dakshin goa loksabhaa seat par kharaab mili iviem main koi bhi batan dabaane par vot bhaajapa ko ja rahaa tha
 Goa's Chief Electoral Officer Kunal issued a statement to the press on Friday, saying such reports were false, misleading and factually incorrect
 kunal ne bayaan jari kar bataaya ki yah spasht kiya jaataa he ki kharaab mashin se chhadam matdaan ke dauraan 17 vot bhaajapa ummidavaar ko jane kaa aarope puri tarah jhootha, gumraah karne vaala or tathyaatmak rup se galat he
 In fact, 17 votes went to the Indian National Congress candidate, Cosmo Francisco Caetano Sardinha, in a proxy poll
 unhone kaha ki iviem or vivipat mashin ko tatkaal badal diya gaya or arakshit rakhe gaye nae upkaran se matdaan hua
 The issue was raised by Aam Aadmi Party candidate Elvis Gomes of South Goa Lok Sabha seat
 rajya kii do siton par 23 april ko matdaan hua tha
 Significantly, this is not the first time that such questions have been raised about evms
 isse pehlesamajawaadee party ke rashtriya adhyakikhilesh yadavane aarope lagaaya tha ki puure bharat main iviem yaa to gadabad hai yaa phir bhaajapa ke paksh main vot daal rahi hai
 Akhilesh had tagged the Election Commission and tweeted that evms (electronic voting machines) all over India are either defective or voting for BJP
 unhone kaha tha ki jiladhikari kehete hai ki nirvachan adhikari iviem parichaalan kii drushti se prashikshit nahin hai
 More than three and a half evms are being replaced
 sapa pramukh ne kaha tha ki yah chunavi prakriya ke lihaaj se aapraadhik laaparvaahee he, vah chunavi prakriya, jis par 50 hajaar karod rupaye kharch ho rahe hai
 Voting is going on today under the third phase for ten seats in Uttar Pradesh
 udhram aadmi party goa main mock pole ke dauraan iviem main gadabadi kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 It was said that during the mock poll it was found that the votes are being transferred to BJP
 isko lekar dilli ke mukhyamantri or party sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne twit kar poocha tha kiiviem sach main kharaab he yaa phir mashin main aise program set kiye gaye hai
 The seeds of these allegations were said to be investigated by the Chief Electoral Officer of Goa
 darasal, goa main aam aadmi party ke sanyojak elvis gomes ne mangalvaar ko twit kar mock poling par sawaal khadey kiye the
 He tweeted, calling it a shame election, alleging that during mock polling, BJP got the maximum 17 votes, Congress got nine and Aam Aadmi Party got eight votes
 unhone apane twit main ellection kamishan of india ke pravaktaa, goa ke mukhya nirvachan adhikari or aam aadmi party ko tag kiya
 His tweet was responded to by the Twitter handle of the Goa Returning Officer - we were investigating the matter
 apadats jari kiye jaaenge
 On this tweet, Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal had said that 'defective' evms in Goa also transfer other votes to BJP
 kya ye vastav main doshapurn hai yaa is tarah se program kiye gaye hai

 Dhoni said before the match, 'I think it is an important match
 yah myne nahin rakhata ki aap kis team ke khilaaf khel rahe ho kyonki sabhi antarrashtriya timen bahut acchhee hai isliye atirikt dabaav lene kaa koi matlab nahin banataa
 Describing the matches between India and Pakistan as big matches, Dhoni said that taking additional pressure would be fatal
 unhone kaha, ‘sabhi antarrashtriya timen acchhee hai or unke paas kai tej gendbaaj hai
 Pakistan also have good spinners in the form of Saeed Ajmal and Mohammad Hafeez
 ham apana ravaiya nahin badalenge
 Dhoni also mentioned India's strong batting before this much-awaited match
 unhone kaha, ‘hamen har samay salaami ballebaajon se shatkeey saajhedaari kii jarurat nahin he
 Our team is one that relies on a good start but that does not mean that we will always need a century partnership

 edbeston ke upar badal chhaae rahane ke kaaran bhartiya team ko edbeston cricket centre ke indor main abhyaas karne ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 Dhoni feels that the toss can play an important role in this match
 unhone kaha, ‘hamen yah dekhne kii jarurat he to kya barish ke kaaran match zyada prabhavit hoga kyonki baad main khilne vaali team ko 20 yaa 25 over hi ballebaaji ke liye mil sakate hai
 In this case, the team playing first will be at a slight disadvantage
 ’ dhoni se poocha gaya ki pakistan is match ko final ke rup main le rahaa he, unhone kaha, ‘ise do tarah se dekha ja saktaa he
 If they are thinking that they have nothing to lose, get on the field and do their best and don't worry about the result then they can be dangerous
 ’unhone kaha, ‘lekin agar ve soch rahe hai ki unhone kwalifai nahin kiya he or yah match bharat ke khilaaf he or hamen ise har haal main jeetna he to phir se sankat main pad sakate hai
 So it depends entirely on the thinking of Pakistan

 Experts say that American companies and industrialists want a policy in India that suits them
 bharat ko usee disha main aage badhate dekh saamaajik kaaryakartaaon ne pradhanmantri modi ko chitthee bhi likhi
 These activists say that our IPR laws are already under WTO rules and TRIPS agreement rules, so why should foreign companies be allowed to break the law according to them
 jaankaron ko dar he ki agar bahurashtriya companiyon or america ke dabaav main hamaari policy se chhedchhad hui to bhartiya janata or kisaanon ke hit prabhavit honge
 The current new policy (which was released in May this year) is linking the government with the slogan of Creative India, Innovative India, but behind this policy there is pressure from American multinational companies that patent from medicine to agriculture and education She wants to increase Raj

 In such a situation, the need for this policy is being questioned

 Will strengthen the ongoing policy to secure or will these changes in our IPR policy only to please the US and American multinationals Is being done for pradhanmantri ne yoga ke mahatv or america samaaj par uske asar ko prabhaavshaalee tareeke se bataaya lekin kya america sarkaar or vahaan kii companiyaan bharat main apane utpaadon ke intelexual property rhite (ipiar) ko lekar itani hi udaar hai? america lagaataar kade ipiar kanoonon ko lekar bharat par dabaav daalata rahaa he
 Yet India is compromising its IPR policy
 sachai ye he ki narendra modi sarkaar ne apane kaarykaal ke do saal puraa hone se thik pehle ek neshnal ipiar niti kaa masauda jari kiya he
 The government may claim that this policy is meant to encourage new inventions, but it is also raising fears that foreign companies (especially American multinationals) will increase their dominance over the Indian market and society

 05: Noted historian Irfan Habibane has accused the Center of the Kimodi government of declining the stature of Mahatma Gandhi to the level of 'senior sanitation inspector' for the Swachh Bharat Mission
 habib ne kaha ki logon ko rashtrapita ke taur unki viraasat kaa jashn manaanaa chahie
 Habib, 87, spoke this at an event addressing historians, scholars, artists, students
 svachh bharat mishan main gandhi ji kii tasviir ke istemaal kaa hawala dete hue habib ne kaha ki aaj, desh kii modi sarkaar rashtrapita mahatma gandhi ke saath varisht swatchta nireekshak jaisaa vyavhaar kar rahi he
 At my moment, we should celebrate his legacy as the Father of the Nation

 The objective of this campaign is to make India an open defecation free country by 2 October 2019
 tab mahatma gandhi kii 150veen jayanti manaai ja rahi hogi
 The picture of Gandhiji's spectacles has been used as the people of this scheme

 In his address, the historian talked about Gandhiji's initial vision of India, which he has written in his book 'hind Swaraj'
 habib ne kaha ki unhone ‘hind’ shabd ko istemaal kiya he na ki ‘bharat’
 Gandhi's channel for India was very broad
 itihaaskaar ne logon se 13 janvari ko bade paimaane par manaane kii guzarish kii jis din gandhi ji ke aamaran anshan kii saalagirah hoti he
 Days later, Gandhiji was assassinated in Delhi
 habib ne kaha ki pakistan main unki hatya kii khabar sunakar muslim mahilaon ne apane haathon kii chudiyon ko tod diya tha
 It was a different time

 bild quality and dizin: In January, Mahinda Rajapaksa agreed to hand over power and quietly vacated his official residence, losing the campaign for the third consecutive term in Sri Lanka's presidency
 hafte bhar baad unhone united piples freedom elliance (upiene) or uske sabase bade sahyogi dal srilanka freedom party (esaffp) kaa netritv apane uttaradhikari maitripal sirisena ko saunp diya
 But on 13 July, the illusion broke that the 69-year-old Rajapaksa would say goodbye to politics after the defeat
 unhone aagaamee aam chunaavon main upiene kii ore se ladgaye kaa parchaa daakhil kar diya he
 For the first time in Sri Lankan history, a former President would be willing to enter Parliament
 kareeb 51
 President Sirisena, who came to power by securing 28 percent of the vote, lashed out at his candidature
 14 july ko tivi par apane sambodhan main unhone kaha, “mahinda rajpakshe 8 janvari ko haare the or phir haarenge
 He also announced not to campaign in favor of UPFA for the August 17 elections
 unke is achaanak fat padane kii vajahen saat maheene se chal rahe aantarik sangharsh main hai
 In November 2014, the quietly working Sinhalese broke away from the 64-year-old Sirisena government and went on to challenge the mighty Rajapaksa in the midterm elections for the presidency
 2009 main libration tigers of tamil ilam (altitii) ke safaaye ke baad rajpakshe taanashaah ban gaye or har tarah ke virodh ko kuchalane lage
 Sirisena has the support of the main opposition United National Party (UNP) and more than 40 other political groups
 alpsankhyak tamil or musalamaanon ne unke paksh main palada jhukaa diya tha
 But Rajapaksa did not challenge the election results
 ve dakshini tat par apane gaanv tangali laut gaye
 Rumors of an attempted military coup on the night of the election results are yet to be confirmed
 lekin rajpakshe se mili raahat thode samay hi rahi
 Recently President Sirisena confessed that due to the interference of the former President, he is facing a lot of difficulty in implementing important reforms
 unhone kaha, “mahinda rajpakshe ne party kii adhyakshata mujhe saunp to di lekin kuch hi samay baad ve namoodaar hue or meri taang khinchaai shuru kar di
 The clash increased so much that parliamentary business began to be blocked
 sirisena sarkaar kii gathjod kii ajeebogareeb sthitiyon se samasya or pechida ho gai
 He made UNP leader Ranil Wickramasinghe the Prime Minister as part of the electoral agreement with the opposition
 unhone kul 225 saansadon vaale sadan main mahaj 47 saansadon kii antarim sarkaar banaai
 This weak government had to fulfill its long list of promises in a hundred days
 sirisena ko isamen kuch shuruaati kamyaabi mili
 The UPFA, which has a majority in Parliament, allowed the populist budget to pass, with price cuts and wage increases in psus
 lekin parade ke peeche se rajpakshe kii dakhsandaji kii vajah se agle sudhaaron kii raah main rukaawatein khadi ho gayi
 The constitutional amendment related to the President's executive rights cut was loosened to gain the support of UPFA
 vah to april main anivaary do-tihaai bahumat se paas ho gaya lekin usee maheene gharelu karj kii seemaa badhaane kaa prastaav paas nahin ho sakaa
 Due to these equations, the proposed election reforms also got delayed
 bhrashtachar par ankush ke liye soochna kaa adhikaar vidheyak or rashtriya audit vidheyak laane kaa vaada kiya gaya tha lekin use sansad main pesh hi nahin kiya ja sakaa
 The government also failed to prosecute corruption against Rajapaksa and his special circle
 sirisena maheenon tak rajpakshe ko satta main laane kii upiene kii muhim kii kaat main hi lage rahe
 He took Rajapaksa's confidants in his cabinet in the hope that he would be able to gain their support, but to no avail
 phir, vikramsinghe ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav laae jane kii sambhaavna ko dekhte hue raashtrapati ne 26 june ko sansad bhang kar di or madhyavadhi chunaavon kaa elaan kar diya
 a few days after that the UPFA announced that Rajapaksa would contest
 rajpakshe ne uttar-pashchim main kurunegala jile kii ek seat ko chunaa he
 They are not fighting Hambantota, their traditional seat in the south for the first time
 isaki siyaasi vajah he
 Kurunegala is dominated by Sinhalese Buddhists and has a large population of military families
 ve votaron main lokapriy bhi hai or vahaan se baari antar se jeet sakate hai
 However, forming a government for Rajapaksa will depend on how many other candidates of UPFA win
 unki mul ranneeti altitii kaa hauva khadaa karne kii hogi, lekin yah baat uchhaalkar bhavanaaen bhadakaane kii koshish bhi hogi ki sirisena ke tahat yuanpi tamilon ke liye alag swytt kshetra banane ja rahi he
 Foreign governments, including India, will be accused of campaigning to defeat Rajapaksa
 yuanpi in chunaavon main ek nae gathjod united neshnal front for good gavarnence (yuanefjiji) ke saath utar rahi he
 It also has Sinhala Nationalist Jatika Hela Urumaya (JHU) among the parties involved on 12 July, which has split from the UPFA after Rajapaksa's election
 buddha sanyasiyon ke apane sadsy hone kaa daawa karne vaali yah party pehali baar dakshinpanthi yuanpi se judi he
 JHU has also forgotten its long-standing differences with the anfgg's other ally, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress
 vikramsinghe ek baar phir rajpakshe ke raaj main bhrashtachar, bhai-bhatijawad or daman ke mudde hi uthaaenge
 But the poor performance of his government in the last six months may dent voters' confidence
 phir, pradhanmantri khud vivaadon se ghir gaye hai
 They are accused of defending the central bank governor in a mess of brand auctions
 governor ne kathith taur par apane kareebi rishtedaaron ko phayda pahunchane ke liye aisa kiya
 The post of Prime Minister is important for Rajapaksa
 chaar dashak tak siyasat kii mukhyadhara main rahe tathaa bataur raashtrapati kaaryakari adhikaron kaa nirankush istemaal kar chuke rajpakshe ke liye saamaanya saansad bane rahanaa apmanjanak ho saktaa he
 However, the biggest obstacle in his path is the President himself, whose political experience is not nineteen from him
 sirisena ne 14 july ko kaha, “agar upiene chunaav jeet jaataa he tab bhi mahinda rajpakshe ke alaava esaffp or sahyogi dalon main kai varisht netaa hai, jinhen pradhanmantri banaaya ja saktaa he
 "however, the President does not have as much support in his own party cadres as he is considered to be the government of the opposition UNP
 kai maheenon kii anischitata ke baad ladaai kii lakeeren khinch gai hai
 Parliament is to sit on 1 September
 is bich, chunaav nateezon ke aane tak donon taraf se jodtod or kharid-farokchat ke daur chalenge kyonki donon hi khemon ke liye sarkaar bananaa ahm he
 For now, it seems that due to President Sirisena's absence from campaigning, the results can be tilted in any direction

 Children are being stolen from Jharkhand in Noida
 beete 4 saal main noida main aise kareeb 15 bachche pakade gaye or sabase bada khulaasa yah ki ye sabhi bachche jharkhand ke ek hi jile ke teen gaanvon ke hai, lekin police ab tak bacchon ko jurm kii duniya tak pahunchane vaale ek bhi gunaahagaar ko nahin pakad saki he
 See ndtv's exclusive report on such children
 mahila kaa purse chori karne kii koshish main 12 disambar,2014 ko noida,sector-20 se baraamad hue bachche ne bataaya ki meri nani ne bolaa chalo
 Money was needed
 ham do bhai or ek bahan hai
 The father is dead
 nani ne bolaa dilli main kuch kaam kara denge
 If i put it in the shop, i said that it is okay vah mujhe yahaan le ain training di, chori karnaa purse lenaa or bhaag janaa
 Question- gave you training? baccha- haa, ek maheene kii training Question- How did they do? baccha- ladies ke peeche lag janaa or purse main se saamaan nikaalkar bhaag janaa Question- Who is this grandmother? 
 What is its name 
 
 Is this your own grandmother? baccha-apni nani nahin he nani kaa naam sonavati he Question- Where did you find this? baccha-gaanv main Question - Was it the first time you came to the village or even saw it before? baccha-pehali baar dekha tha Question- Did he talk to your parents or did he talk to himself? baccha-mere se baat kii thi or main bhaag aayaa Question - How did you bring it from the village? baccha -train se bithakar laai phir puraani dilli utaar diya In an attempt to steal the woman's phone, a child recovered from Noida Sector-20 on 20 January 2015 stated that sunil lekar aayaa tha
 He was speaking, let's rotate
 yahaan aane ke baad bolaa 2-3 din kaam karegaa chori kaa
 
 
 We will not speak
 bolaa kar lo paisa nahin he
 How will the village go, will sell phones
 
 
 sawaal-sunil ko kya aap pehle se jaanate hai? Baby-he knows my mom sawaal-or kitne bacchon ko lekar aayaa he 
 
 kitne bachche hai uske paas? The kid came with 2-3, brought him back to the village? sawaal-saare bacchon se chori karwaata he? Baby yes sawaal-kya chori nahin karne par pitayee karata he ? Baby yes sawaal-kitni baar chori kii? Baby once sawaal-kya chori kar rahe the? Baby phone sawaal- kiskaa phone chori kar rahe the ? Baby memes sawaal-to aapako logon ne vahaan pakad liya? Baby yes sawaal-pitayee kii aapaki ? Baby yes sapanom kaa shahar noida, aasmaan chooti imaaraten, shandaar malls or dukaanon se ghira, bheedbhra sector 18 kaa atta market
 In this dazzle, some 8-15 year old children try the tricks of theft and snooping
 
 And no one blinks the purse and blows away the purse and the mobile is successful at times, luck is sometimes lost
 childline ke sangyojanak satprakash ne bataaya ki 2011 se 2015 tak hamaara anubhav nikal kar aayaa ki sector-20 ke aasapaas jahaan malls hai, vahaan par chote-chote bachche jo lagbhag 10-16 saal ke hote hai, ve chori karte hue pakade ja rahe hai or chori bhi aisi jaise mobile-purse kii choti-choti choriyaan
 Till now we have faced about 15 such cases and the biggest thing is that all these children are from the same village of Maharajganj in Sahibganj of the same district of Jharkhand
 aise main jaahir he ki bacchon ko ek hi jagah se laakar chori ke dhandhe main lagane vaala koi bada giroh behad sakriy or bada he
 These children will also tell you the names of some of those childhood merchants
 childline kii maane to jaise hi bachche kisi jurm main pakade jate hai, dallalon ke phone aane shuru ho jate hai
 Sometimes, when someone starts being a grandmother and remembers, someone talks about it as an uncle
 itnaa hi nahin bacchon ko chhudaane kii evaj main paise kaa ofer bhi dete hai
 Not only this, Childline realizes the danger when the poor and illiterate parents of the children come here from there after making the news, who at first sight can see that they are in every way The legal help of the m / s would have been provided by the brokers so that the children could be freed and put into the same business again
 misaal ke taur par beete saal 12 disambar ko pakade gaye bachche ko lene ek mahila pahunchi
 The woman, who described herself as a mother, had a gram panchayat certificate and a picture of her cut paste with the child
 childline ke sanyojak satprakash ne bataaya ki bal kalyaan samiti ko bacchon ke maa-baap ke saunpane se pehle seedblusi se gharelu jaanch karaani chahie vah is cheez ko pholo nahin kar rahe hai
 We have had 15 cases so far
 unamem kisi bhi ek cese main seedblusi ne gharelu adhyayan nahin karaayaa taaki ye pataa chal sake ki bachche noida kyon aa rahe hai unka gharelu parivesh kaisaa he
 According to records, a child was caught stealing twice on the same pattern
 child line ke mutabik, pehali baar pakade gaye bacchon ke khilaaf koi exiaar nahin banati
 Such children fall under the category of child and protection
 police didi entry karti he or bal kalyaan samiti ke saamne pesh kar bacchon ko unke gharavaalon ko saunp diya jaataa he
 In 2013, Childline asked the SSP of Noida to take action against the gang that pushed the children into the crime
 lekin police yaa seedblusi khamosh bani rahi, ab enditivi se police kade kadam uthaane kii baat kar rahi he
 SP Sunita Singh of Crime Branch of Noida is right, children have been found
 bachche pariwaron ko hendover bhi ho gaye
 Now we are finding out who brought the children, some person, we are searching for that person and on the day that person is found, strict action will be taken against him
 asal main apradhi ye bachche nahin balki ve log hai, jo bacchon main aisi soch paidaa karte hai
 Pushes them into this swamp
 bacchon ko jurm kii duniya main dhakelne vaale asli khilaadi yahi hai
 Some in this city, some in the cities around this city, but no one is interested in catching them

 Bollywood actress Vidya Balan has played important roles in films like 'ishqiyaan' 'kahani' which was well appreciated by the audience as well as the critics
 jald hi vidya kii film 'TE3N' relies hone vaali he
 Here are the highlights of the special conversation with him
 aap amitabh bachchan ke saath ek baar phir se kaam kar rahi hai?ji, har baar bachchan sahab ke saath kuch nayaa kaam karne ko mila
 His mother was made in 'paa', but did not go too close to him in the middle of Tex
 bachapan se hi main unki fain rahi hum, jab bhi camera on hota he to maine unhen bataur kairactor hi paaya he
 And as soon as the camera was off, i used to sit in the corner
 bahut hi behtareen actor hai
 i can't believe how the same actor can play 5-7 different characters, that's why Amit ji always surprises you
 filmon main 'gaaliyon' kaa istemaal kitna sahi he?maine bhi 'ishkiyaan' film main gaali di thi
 Abuses are often used in everyday life
 agar kahani asli ghatnaon par aadhaarit he or kirdaar ke liye sahi he to dialogs main gaali dena galat nahin he
 How much does the box office matter? The box office shows that more and more people have seen this film
 box offiske numbers ko aap control nahin kar sakate
 If all the attention remains at the box office, then it is difficult to work
 kya aap hameshaa lead role hi karnaa chaahati hai?aisa nahin he, agar script acchhee he to saamne koi bhi ko-actor ho, film karne main majaa aata he
 But nowadays, the directors first make it in their mind that Vidya will not like this script, oh come with me once, give me a chance to read
 soshal netwarking saits ko kis tarah se leti hai?ji main vahaan par logon ke coment nahin padhati
 i have very thin skin and i get affected very quickly
 isiilie maine nirnay kiya he ki negative coment kii vajah se khud ko prabhavit nahin hone duungi
 Does your husband (siddharth Roy Kapoor) comment on your work? No, he also knows that if he does, he will get the problem
 kya aap or siddharth ek saath kisi film main kaam karenge, jise vah produs karen?hamaari koshish rahati he ki ham ek duusare ke saath kaam naa karen
 This is a good thing for our married life
 maine aisi kai filmein chodi bhi hai lekin unka naam lenaa sahi nahin hoga
 Such a sacrifice is very important for the film of life
 siddharth or main apni personal or profeshnal life ko mix nahin karte, nahin to offis or ghar main kuch bhi alag nahin rah paaegaa
 You are doing a biopic of Kamala Das? Yes, i wanted to know a lot about him
 vah kaphiprogressive ladithim isiilie unki byopic ke liye maine haa kaha
 Would like to come on TV too? i have seen 'zindagi' channel in the past
 kaaphi achche serials vahaan aate hai
 Till now no such thing has been made, if at all i will definitely tell
 pakistani film karengi?mujhe ophers to aae hai
 i will think if the script is good and according to me
 loksabhaa chunaav kii viipi or romaanchak raajnneetik jangon main se ek kaa najaara aaj bang bhoomi par dekhne ko milegaa
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address a huge rally at the historic Brigade Parade Ground in Kolkata today
 yah vahi brigade parade ground he jahaan 19 janvari ko mamata trinmul congress kii netaa or pashchim bengal kii siem mamata banerjee ne 22 vipakshi dalon ke saath raily kii thi or chunauti di thi ki agar dam he to modi is maidan ko bharkar dikhaaen
 The BJP had also tried to hold Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rally in that ground, but the state government had allegedly not given permission
 siem mamata banerjee bhi idhar aaj hi pashchim bengal main apane prachaar abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karengi
 Mamta Banerjee is going to do a big public meeting in Cooch Behar's Dinhata
 piem modi kii duusari raily uttar bengal ke silligudi main he
 After the announcement of Lok Sabha elections, PM Narendra Modi is going to address the rally in West Bengal for the first time
 yun to pashchim bengal main pehle charan main 2 siton kuchbihar or alipuradwar par hi matdaan he, lekin piem modi or mamata banerjee kii ye 2 reliyaan rajya kaa raajnneetik agenda set karne vaali hai
 The Brigade Parade Ground, witness of political change, tell the people who understand the politics of Delhi and North India that the importance of Ramlila Maidan in this area for rallies is the same importance of Brigade Parade Ground in West Bengal rally
 is maidan main kai aitihaasik reliyaan ho chuki hai
 It is necessary to mention here the rally in 1972 which was done by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi with Mujibur Rahman, the hero of the independence of Bangladesh
 brigade parade ground itnaa vishaal he ki isamen 15 lakh log aa sakate hai
 On January 19 this year, when the Grand Alliance rally was held on this ground under the leadership of Mamata Banerjee, Mamata challenged PM Modi and said that if there is substance in him, then he should fill this ground
 mamata kii chunauti ke baad piem narendra modi is maidan main pehali baar hunkaar bharne ja rahe hai
 For this, 1000 loudspeakers have been installed in this ground
 BJP or TMC kii siyaasi ladaibhartiya janata party is vakt tiemasi or mamata banerjee se raajnneetik ladaai lard rahi he
 BJP President Amit Shah has raised the political temperature of the state, aiming to win 23 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal
 pashchim bengal main loksabhaa kii 42 siten hai
 In the last Lok Sabha election, BJP won only 2 seats
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main bhale hi bhaajapa ko bengal se 2 seat mili hon, lekin vot kul 17 pratishat mili the
 Even though the party's vote was 10 per cent in the assembly elections 2016, BJP was second on more than 75 per cent seats in the state
 ab loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne apane lakshya ko kai guna badhaakar tiemasi ke saamne apane iraade saaf kar die hai
 Let us know that in the year 2018, the BJP achieved good success in the Panchayat elections of West Bengal
 party tiemasi se to aage nahin bad pai, lekin congress or sipiem ko peeche dhakelte hue kai jagahon par number 2 kii party ban gai
 The BJP also won several gram panchayats
 is chunaav ke dauraan bijepi ne tiemasi par bade paimaane par hinsa karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya tha
 After these results, the BJP is upbeat and it is contesting the Lok Sabha elections vigorously
 mamata ne ek din pehle shuru kiya prachaar abhiyansamachar agency pitiai ke mutabik mamata banerjee apni chunavi raily kii shuruyaat 4 april ko karne vaali thim, lekin 3 april ko piem modi kaarykram dekhakar mamata ne bhi apni raily ko ek din pehle khiskaa diya
 In fact, Mamata does not want to be a bit behind the BJP in a political contest
 hamalavar rahi hai mamtabijepi kii raajnneetik mahatvakanksha dekh siem mamata banerjee piem narendra modi or amit shah par lagaataar hamalaa bol rahi hai
 Mamta Banerjee has been strongly attacking the Narendra Modi government over the issue of CBI, national security, terrorism, Pakistan
 5 march ko mamata ne kaha tha ki centre kii sarkaar javaanon kii shahadat ke bal par chunaav jeetna chaahati he
 Earlier Mamata Banerjee had cordoned off the Balakot air strike and said that being the opposition, the PM should have given them full details of the operation and should have told where the bombs were dropped, how many people died there
 isi saal farvari maheene main mamata banerjee ne tab centre ke sarkaar khullamakhulla raajnneetik jang kaa elaan kar diya tha jab wo kolkata ke tatkaaleen police kamishnar par sibiai ke chaape ke khilaaf kolkata main dharne par baith gayi thi
 Mamta had then said that Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are plotting a coup in the state
 mamata banerjee notebandi ke mudde par bhi narendra modi par hamalaa kar chuki hai
 In a rally organized with Akhilesh in Lucknow, he had said that PM Modi riots and he is a bigger dictator than Hitler
 mamata ne kaha tha ki notebandi lagu kar unhone apatkaal jaisaa maahaul bana diya he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also been responding to the attack of Mamta in her own style
 2 farvari ko pashchim bengal main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue piem ne kaha tha ki panshchim bengal ke logon kaa unke prati pyaar dekhakar mamata banerjee dar gai he
 The PM had said that he can now understand why his party has resorted to violence and is killing innocent people
 party adhyaksh amit shah ne isse pehle pashchim bengal sarkaar ko gherte hue kaha tha ki aakhir pashchim bengal ke logon ko saraswati puja manaane kii aazaadee kyon nahin he
 He had said that when Saraswati Puja will not be celebrated in West Bengal, will it be celebrated in Pakistan
 chunaav kii har khabar milegi sidhe aapke inbox main
 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter nobel puraskaar vijeta arthshaastri amartya sen bengal main chhidi jai shriram or jai maa durga vaali siyasat kaa saamaajik or saanskrithik vishleshan karne ke baad is nattejey par pahunche hai ki bengal main maa durga ke jayakaare ke aage bijepi kaa jai shriram vaala naaraa kahin nahin thahartaa
 Now the question is what are the circumstances that led to the idea of a Nobel Prize-winning economist doing comparative studies between Shriram and Maa Durga
 shriram se zyada maa durga kii fain foloindmartya sen ne kaha, meraa maananaa he ki jai shriram ke naare kaa bengali samskruti se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 In the culture of Bengal, there is no question of Sriram in the view of Nobel Prize winning economist Amartya Sen giving political classes to the students of Kolkata's Jadavpur University
 shriram se kai guna zyada fain folowing to maa durga kii he
 Amartya Sen has pondered over the culture of Bengal with his four-year-old granddaughter to reach this conclusion
 bengal main jai shriram or jai maa durga kii gunthmartya sen ne apni chaar saal kii potee se poocha ki uske pasandida bhagwaan koun hai? usne jawaab diya, maa durga
 He said that Maa Durga is omnipresent in our (bengali community) life
 maa durga ke mahatv kii tulana ram navami se nahin kii ja sakati
 The idea of doing a comparative study of the fan following of Maa Durga and Shri Ram is not a product of Amartya Sen's cultural mind, but his ideas seem completely inspired by the current politics of Bengal
 jisamen do hi naare gunj rahe hai, ek jai shriram or doosraa jai maa durga
 On the one hand the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is strengthening its land in Bengal with the help of Jai Shriram, on the other hand Mamata Banerjee has brought Mother Durga against Bengal in the political war of Bengal
 jisko lekar loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bhi, chunaav ke dauraan bhi or chunaav ke baad bhi bengal kii siyasat se lekar sadakon tak par bavaal machaa he
 Amartya Sen and Mamta Banerjee share similar views that Amartya Sen's views match those of Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, as the bjp's Jai Shri Ram is facing the Trinamool Congress (TMC) slogan of Jai Maa Durga
 raajnneetik vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki amartya sen ne jai shriram or maa durga ke naaron kii tulana nahin kii balki bijepi or tiemasi kii tulana kii he
 The BJP-TMC expressed its displeasure with these views of Amartya Sen on the slogan of Jai Shri Ram face to face
 bengal main jai shriram ke naare ko lekar tiemasi or bijepi pehle se hi aamane-saamne hai
 Now Amartya Sen has tried to increase the controversy by jumping into this controversy
 bengal main bijepi bhi jai shriram ke naaron se mamata banerjee ko chidhaane se baj nahin aati he
 Wherever Mamta goes, BJP workers reach there shouting slogans of Jai Shri Ram
 aisa hi ek vakya 30 may ko uttar 24 pargana main hua tha jab mamata banerjee ke kafile ko dekhakar kuch logon ne jai shriram ke naaraa lagaae
 After which Mamta was so irritated that she got down from her car and started raging slogans
 bijepi kaa aarope-bharat kii saanskrithik lokachar ko bhul gaye hai senjay shriram naare kaa bengali samskruti se koi aitihaasik sambandh nahin he
 Criticizing Sen's view, the BJP said economist Sen was cut off from Indian cultural folklore, as he mostly lives abroad
 videsh main rahane ke kaaran desh kii paramparaon ko bhuule senbijepi kii rajya ikai ke adhyaksh dilip ghosh ne kaha, sen zyaadaatar videshon main rahete hai
 He has no involvement or contribution towards the people of India, nobody cares about his speeches
 jo unpar nirbhar hai, ve khatm ho gaye hai
 At the same time, another BJP leader Mukul Roy said that Jai Shri Ram slogan is a symbol of good governance
 unhone kaha ki sen kai varshon tak videsh main rahane ke kaaran nishchit rup se desh kii paramparaon ko bhul gaye hai
 Significantly, Sen had said in a public meeting on Friday at Jadavpur University that he had not heard Jai Shri Ram in this manner
 unhone kaha ki is naare kaa istemaal ab logon kii pitayee ke vakt kiya ja rahaa he
 Sen had said that this slogan has no connection with Bengali culture

 After Indira Gandhi, when Rajiv Gandhi's government was formed, the BJP intensified the antagonism of the Congress and surrounded it on the issue of familyism and corruption
 purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi (atal Bihari Vajpayee) duniya ko alavida chuke hai
 On Thursday at the age of 93, he breathed his last at Delhi's AIIMS
 vaajapeyi desh ke pehle netaa hai jo gaiyr congressi pradhanmantri bane the
 Vajpayee contested the Lok Sabha elections from 1952 to 2004
 is dauraan unhone kai kirtiman sthapit kiye, lekin paanch loksabhaa siton par unhen haar kaa munh bhi dekhnaa padaa tha
 Vajpayee is the only politician in the country who has represented six Lok Sabha constituencies in four states
 uttar pradesh ke lakhanu or balrampur, gujarat ke gandhinagar, madhyapradesh ke gwalior or vidisha or dilli kii nai dilli sansadeey seat se chunaav jeetne vaale vaajapeyi eklaute netaa hai

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee first contested the 1952 Lucknow Lok Sabha bypoll, but did not succeed
 congress kii shivarajvati nehru se jansangh se chunaav lard rahe atal bihari vaajapeyi ko haar mili
 Interestingly, Vajpayee remained at number three
 vaajapeyi ke haath pehali baar safalataa 1957 main lagi
 In 1957, Jan Sanghne contested them from three Lok Sabha seats Lucknow, Mathura and Balrampur
 lakhanu main congress ke pulin bihari banerjee ne jansangh pratyaashee atal bihari vaajapeyi ko maat di
 His bail was seized in Mathura
 mathura main unke saamne congress se choudhary digambar singh or socialist party ke raja mahendra pratap singh bhi chunaav lard rahe the
 In support of Vajpayee, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay and Nanaji Deshmukh held 14-14 meetings in one day
 iske baad bhi atal bihari vaajapeyi haar gaye
 He had to face defeat at the hands of Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh
 haalanki balrampur sansadeey seat se chunaav jitkar loksabhaa pahunche
 Vajpayee contested the third Lok Sabha election from Lucknow in 1962
 congress ke bike dhon se unka muqabla hua or yahaan bhi unhen haar mili
 He was then elected a Rajya Sabha member
 iske baad 1967 main phir loksabhaa chunaav lade or lekin jeet nahin sake
 This was followed by a by-election in 1967, where he won and became an MP
 1971 main paanchaven loksabhaa chunaav mejhtal bihari vaajapeyimadhya pradesh ke gwalior sansadeey seat se utre or jitkar sansad pahunche
 He represented the New Delhi parliamentary constituency in the 1977 post-emergency and then mid-term elections in 1980
 1984 main atal bihari ne madhya pradesh ke gwalior se loksabhaa chunaav kaa parchaa daakhil kar diya or unke khilaaf achaanak congress ne madhavrao sindhiya ko khadaa kar diya
 Whereas Madhavrao used to come from Guna parliamentary constituency
 sindhiya se vaajapeyi paune do lakh voton se haar gaye
 Let me tell you that Atal Bihari also once mentioned that he himself had asked Madhavrao in the corridor of Parliament that he would not contest from Gwalior
 madhavrao ne us samay manaa kar diya tha, lekin congress kii ranneeti ke tahat achaanak unka parchaa daakhil kara diya gaya
 In this way, Vajpayee did not have a chance to file nomination from elsewhere
 aise main unhen sindhiya se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 After this, Vajpayee contested the 1991 general elections from Lucknow and Vidisha seats of Madhya Pradesh and won from both places
 baad main unhone vidisha seat chhod di
 However, LK Advani did not contest from Gandhinagar due to his name appearing in the Hawala incident in 1996
 is sthiti main atal bihari vaajapeyi ne lakhanu seat ke saath-saath gandhinagar se chunaav ladaa or donon hi jagahon se jeet hasil kii
 After this, Vajpayee made Lucknow his work place
 1998, 1999 or 2004 kaa loksabhaa chunaav lakhanu seat se jitkar saansad bane

 In the Lok Sabha, Dhananjay Singh of the BSP claimed to have serious flaws in the MGNREGA during the Question Hour, adding that it was not appropriate to associate the name of a great man like Mahatma Gandhi with the scheme

 You may not like the implementation and progress of this scheme but it does not mean that there is no benefit

 Ever since the Central Government has released the list of Smart Cities, some Chief Ministers have been angry with the absence of even a single city in their state
 bihar or uttar pradesh se ek bhi jila mukhyalay kaa naam na hone par in rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ke tevar kuch zyada hi garam hai
 On Sunday, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar called the Central Government to 'favor' and said that Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in which in the last Lok Sabha elections, 104 parliamentarians won the BJP alliance by not selecting a single city in those two states
 The central government showed its real face
 nitish ne daawa kiya kii jo bhi kaagazi karwaai is sambandh main kerani thi, bihar sarkaar ne puraa kiya, lekin pehle 100 smart city kii ghoshnaa kar centre sarkaar ne maatr 20 shaharon ko smart banane kii soochi jari kii
 The comments haalanki nitish kumaar ne mana ki smart city kaa koi matlab nahin hota lekin bihar or uttar pradesh ke ek bhi shahar kaa chayan na hone se wo saafe naaraaz dikhe
 Earlier, when the list of 20 cities came up, the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party had claimed that the central government did not select a single city in compulsion due to the completion of the paperwork by the Bihar government in time
 lekin usapar nitish kumaar ne kaha tha ki ye andher nagari he or centre sarkaar apane nirnay main kshetreey santulan kaa khyaal nahin rakhti
 Nitish is definitely upset with the selection criteria
 haalanki bihar ke mukhyamantri ne ab daawa kiya he ki smart gaanv banane kii unki ghoshnaa par kaam shuru ho gaya he
 Therefore his seven determinations include water supply to every household and construction of taps and toilets in the village as a priority of his current government
 nitish ke tevar se spasht he ki aane vaale dinon main wo bihar or uske bahaar bijepi or unke sahyogiyon ko is mudde par gherne kii koshish karenge

 nitish ke tevar se spasht he ki aane vaale dinon main wo bihar or uske bahaar bijepi or unke sahyogiyon ko is mudde par gherne kii koshish karenge
 Nitish claimed that whatever paperwork had to be done in this regard, the Bihar government completed it, but by announcing the first 100 smart cities, the central government released a list to make only 20 cities smart
 tippaniyan Although Nitish Kumar admitted that smart city does not make any sense, but he did not look at any of the cities of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 isse pehle 20 shaharon kii soochi aane par bhartiya janata party ke netaaon ne daawa kiya tha ki bihar sarkaar dwaara kagaji karwaai samay par puraa na hone ke kaaran centre sarkaar ne majaburi main ek bhi shahar kaa chayan nahin kiya
 But Nitish Kumar said that it is a dark city and the central government does not take care of the regional balance in its decision
 nishchit rup se chayan ke maapdand se nitish khafa hai
 However, the Chief Minister of Bihar has now claimed that work has started on his announcement to build a smart village
 isliye unke saat nishchay main har ghar ko jal aapurti or gaanv main nalon or shauchalayon kaa nirmaan unki vartmaan sarkaar kii praathamikta main shaamil hai
 It is clear from Nitish's attitude that in the coming days he will try to surround Bihar and its outside BJP and his allies on this issue

 It is a good sign for our team and i am happy with this man of the match award

 It is being speculated that in the absence of Dhawan, Lokesh Rahul may play the opening batting role for India along with Rohit Sharma

 There are some Ganesh who got so much information from the mere trial of free basics of Facebook that the yield of their fields has doubled! If you are aware of the current state of India's farming, then you will not accept this Ganesh Katha of the advertisements of the world's largest social network company as a rule, not an exception, but then it is certain that the huge ads of Facebook Free Basics will give you "some So there is politics, ”the suspects will not leave without feeling full
 jaise chunavi vigyapanon main garibi va asamanta hataane ke liye vot maange jate hai thik usee tarj par fasebuk agar bharat main digital asamanta dur karne ke liye apni free basics seva ko chunane kii apil kare to sab kuch saamaanya nahin he
 Actually, before we are able to free our market and liberalization, both government and private, from monopoly, we are going to dive into the complex politics of the market
 yah siyasat rosemara kii raajnneeti se zyada pechida or prabhavi he kyonki isamen chuni hui sarkarein bhi shaamil ho jaati hai
 The question related to Facebook's free basics is extremely basic
 koi hamen shopping mal main bula rahaa he jahaan entry free hogi lekin badale main sirf chuninda dukaanon se saamaan lene kii chhot hogi
 If you want to roam and buy food in the whole mall then you will not get free entry
 kya ham aisa chaahate hai? isse pehle ki ham free internet bahes main utren, internet kii maujuud vyavastha ko samajhnaa jaruri he
 Under the current policy of India, mobile operators have got spectrum under which everyone gets equal internet
 jo jis speed kaa data package letaa he utana internet chalata he
 Internet needs to be cheap and companies should get facilities and concessions for this, but if a company wants to take you on a limited area instead of free internet, then it is against the freedom of internet that India is giving and ideal for the world
 is
 internet kii duniya main teen bhagidaar hai jo ise mukt sansar banaate hai
 Facebook's free basics will spoil these three
 internet tak pahunchane kii sadak yani telecom network mobile operataron ne banaai he
 Obviously, Facebook's free basics will be found on the network of the same company, that means it will get more customers to the operator, which will spoil the competition in the mobile market
 is bazaar ke duusare bhagidaar media, i-commers aadi contate va seva companiyaan hai
 Internet is completely free in India
 lekin fasebuk ke bazaar main unheen kii dukaan lagegi jo uske saath honge teesraa, khud internet he jisamen muft lekin simit pahunch kaa niyam, iske swatantra hone kii buniyaad hi hilaa degaa
 The country's largest operator Airtel last year proposed to give free internet access to some websites under the Airtel Zero service, instead they were going to pay money to Airtel website
 yah peshkash bharat main net nutrality kii bahes kii shuruyaat thi
 Offers like Facebook Free Basics cannot just compete in Western markets that worship competition, it can only woo backward and developing countries
 iske baavjood do din pehle egypt ne free basics band kar diya
 Actually, the business interests of Facebook and Airtel are safe in the free market and not in the market that they want to create
 bhartiya bazaar main ekadhikaar va cartelon kaa dakhal pehle se he
 Facebook is going to strengthen this imbalance with the help of its size, followers and influence
 license permit raaj khatm hone ke baad bhi bharat kaa bazaar puri tarah khul nahin sakaa
 If the government withdrew, people became bonded to select companies
 hamaare masik bill bhugtan hamen bataa denge ki ham kis tarah adhikansh paisa kareeb do darjan companiyon ko de rahe hai
 From chocolate to mobile, there are dozens of products and services in which we have a choice
 isliye inke bazaar main yaa to ekadhikaar (monopali) hai yaa cartil
 On the other hand, the government has a monopoly on petroleum, railways, coal, electricity etc
, so both the consumers are the victim of anti-competition activities whereas the competition in automobile, food products, medicine is better than them
 bharat ko jin sudhaaron kii jarurat he ve bazaar ko kholane ke saath use santulit karne the or inamen sarkaar kii bhoomika sabase badi hone vaali he
 The government not only had to get out of its monopoly areas but also to increase competition in the areas where private cartels have become
 masalan, mobile ko hi len jahaan 2ji se 4ji tak jate operataron kii sankhya ghat rahi he yani pratispardhaa kam ho rahi he
 Amidst these expectations, when experts in the government like Nandan Nilekani advocate giving free internet to people through Aadhaar card, it becomes difficult to understand whether we are moving towards the end of government subsidy or start new subsidy schemes
 To do
 ham udaarikaran ke jariye sabhi ko avasar dene vaala mukt bazaar banane chale the
 We thought that the role of government in people's lives and business would be limited, but the whole model of India's economic liberalization from Congress to BJP has become confused
 ham nae kism ke sarkarikaran se mukaabil hai or bazaar main pratispardhaa simit karne ke nae tareekon kaa istemaal bad gaya he
 The threat from Net Neutrality in India was averted after Airtel Zero protests last year, but TRAI has reopened the debate and Facebook's alleged Ganesha has begun to show the benefits of social networking in farming through expensive advertisements
 yakeenan is bahes kii dobaaraa shuruyaat ko fasebuk ke america manch par bhartiya pradhanmantri kii maujuudagi se jodgaye kaa samarthan nahin kiya ja saktaa lekin agar baat nikali he to dur talak jaaegi or log narendra modi se ummid jarur karenge ki unki sarkaar bazaar kii aazaadee kii pairokaar banakar ubharegi, pratispardhaaen simit karne kii koshishon kii himachati nahin

 Now, what will Karan do, this film will tell you, but i will tell you the flaws and the shortcomings of the film, the first of which is the flaws
 kaamiyaan Talking about the shortcomings of this film, i feel that the screen play needed to be tightened further because the film starts lengthening in both the first half and second half, ie the film drags, one of the reasons is that the story in the film is also Na is equal and this film only proceeds on Comedy
 yani comdi ke liye seen daale gaye he or ye kahani ko aage nahin badhaate

 ek aadhikarik bayaan main kaha gaya he, "sarkaar ne kisaanon ke hit main emiies ke tahat maujuuda 5 pratishat ke protsaahan ko badhaakar aaj das pratishat kar diya

 Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh said on Friday that the Akshardham temple, built on the banks of the Yamuna river in the national capital, had neither received the environmental clearance nor had the temple builders ever applied for it
 lekin mantri ne sweekaar kiya ki is bare main ab kuch bhi nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Regarding the construction of this magnificent temple of Swaminarayan Sampradaya which was built in the year 2005 in more than 30 acres on the banks of river Yamuna, Ramesh said, "those who built the Akshardham temple did not even apply for obtaining environmental clearance
 bina paryaavaran manjuuri ke is mandir kaa nirmaan yamuna nadi ke tat par hua
 This is a strange kind of environment
 ’unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘paryaavaran mantralay nadi niyaman kshetra (ararjed) sambandhi adhisuchana jari karne ke bare main gambhirtha se vichaar kar rahaa he taaki jis tarah yamuna nadi ke kinare vinaashkari nirmaan hua he, vaisaa bhavishya main nahin ho
 The construction of the Akshardham Temple was the first example of its kind to damage the river
 iske baad bhi kai nirmaan hote gayi
 Asked if the Akshardham temple has been built in open violation of environmental regulations, Ramesh said, "construction has been done
" aage nadi ko or nuksaan nahin ho, iske liye hamen sochna hoga
 "is the environment ministry considering any action against the temple," the minister said, "we cannot demolish the Akshardham temple complex
 hamen yamuna nadi ke baaki tateey kshetra ko bachaana hoga
 'ramesh said,' Similarly there is also a question whether the Commonwealth Games Village should have been built
 iskaa jawaab he ki aisa bilkul nahin hona chaiye tha
 "did the environment ministry approve the construction of the Commonwealth Games Village, the minister said," Yes, it was approved
 vahaan khel gaanv bana he or use manjuuri mili thi
 i do not want to talk about the past
 ’ unhone kaha ki rashtramandal khel gaanv ke nirmaan ko manjuuri mili, jise ucchtam nyaayalay ne ek janhit yachika par sunwaayee karne ke baad barkaraar rakhaa
 Otherwise, the construction of the sports village should not have got the environmental clearance
 ramesh ne kaha, ‘nadi ke kinaaron kaa sangrakshan karnaa jaruri he
 We are considering issuing notification of river regulation area
 ummid he ki tateey niyaman kshetra kii hi tarah agle kuch maheenon main nadi niyaman kshetra sambandhi adhisuchana bhi jari kar di jaayegi
 Ramesh said that a similar suggestion has come from many organizations working for the conservation of Yamuna river
 ham paryaavaran sangrakshan kanoon ke tahat nadi niyaman kshetra sambandhi adhisuchana jari karenge

 a man first divorced his wife and made her homeless
 iske baad dobaaraa talakshuda patni ko saath main rakhane ke liye apane hi pita ke saath nikaah karakar halaala kara diya
 The process of getting Susar married with daughter-in-law did not stop here

 is saal may main dawanal se uttarakhand ke pahaado ke khubasurat najaare dhundh kii parat se dhundhala gaye
 So far, more than 4,200 hectares of forest fires have been visited in the state this year
 aise main mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat ne van vibhaag ke adhikariyon ko aade haathon lete hue poocha ki unhone kya taiyaari kii thi ki phir pahaad aisi bheeshan aag kii chapet main aa gaye?mukhyamantri ne vanagni kii ghatnaon kii rokthaam ke liye prabhavi kadam uthaane ke nirdesh die or kaha ki vanagni kii javabdehi sambandhit adhikariyon kii hogi
 He also asked the local people to join the case
 pichley saal 1,244 hectare van kshetra main aag lagi thi, vahiin 2016 main is aag main lagbhag 4,500 hectare jangal swaha ho gaya tha
 According to the Indian Institute of Disaster Management claim, excess heat was the cause of forest at that time
 prati varsh lagbhag 55 pratishat se adhik van ke aag kii chapet main aa jane ke kaaran paristhitiki ke alaava 440 karod ru
 There is also an economic loss of
 van vibhaag se jude log is aag ke liye sthaneey logon ko jimmedaar tehraate hai
 The High Court had taken suo motu cognizance of the fire related news and sought a response from the government
 kumaun mandal ke mukhya van sangrakshak kapil joshi ne adaalat main kaha ki kumaun kshetra main aag par purna rup se kaabo paa liya gaya he
 He said that to keep the forest fires under control, the department is increasing the participation of the villagers and also providing funds to extinguish the forest panchayats
 unhone adaalat ko bataaya ki pradesh main 90 pratishat maamalon main aag maanav janit thi
 The court was not satisfied with the response of the forest department and asked the government to file a reply again
 hycourt baar association ke purv adhyaksh em
 C
 pant ne van vibhaag ke jawaab par sawaal uthaae hai, "van vibhaag ko eparai, wadiya institute, survey of india kii madad leni chahie
 The claim to control 90 percent of the fire is also false
 90 fisadi aag maanavajanit kahi ja rahi he, jabaki gaanvon se to adhikansh aabaadi palaayan kar chuki he
 Government figures themselves are doing this
 '' vahiin sthaneey log bhi van vibhaag or bhu-mafiaon par aag lagane kaa aarope lagaate hai
 Mallika Virdi, an environmental activist and local forest panchayat president of Munsiyari town in Pithoragarh, says, "apart from natural causes, people actually set fire to destroy weeds and non-essential plants from grasses
" unka maananaa hota he ki uske baad paidaa hui ghaas jaanwaron ke liye acchhee hoti he
 Many times this fire spreads to the surrounding forests and creates havoc
 '' chid ke ped se nikalne vaale lisa ke sampark main aate hi yah aag vikaraal rup dhaaran kar leti he
 Most of the forest occurrences have been recorded in dense pine forests
 vanagni ke kaaran jalsroton ko nuksaan hota he or glacier or nadiyaan bhi prabhavit hoti hai
 They harm flora and wildlife
 is saal bhi jangalon main bharal sambar or anya hiranon ke jalakar marane kii khabaren ain par van adhikariyon ne isse inkaar kiya he
 If you look at the preliminary assessment of the study being conducted by the Planning Department on Ecosystem Services, Uttarakhand with odd geography is about three lakh crores
 kii paryaavarniya sevaayen de rahaa he
 Forests here alone contribute Rs 98,000 crore
 ke lagbhag he
 Not only are the mountains safe, but the main factors of the environment are air, soil and water also help the country in one way or the other
 lekin jis tarah jangalon kii aag kii chunauti bad rahi he, sthitiyaan badal sakati hai

 However, like previous films, this time too, Jimmy Shergill will be seen in Sahab's role and Mahi Gill will be seen in Biwi's role

 In the first part, Randeep Hooda was a gangster, in the second Irrfan Khan and now Sanjay Dutt is playing this character
 lekin is baar kahani sanjay dutt ke ird-gird ghumegi

 Today, during the rally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan, Gautam Gambhir also got the opportunity to 'open' on the stage
 gautam gambhir ne aam aadmi party par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Gautam Gambhir said that people ask me what did you learn when you got into politics from cricket? On this, i tell him that i always learned in cricket that if you fight, you always face to face
 peeth peeche to kaayar ladate hai
 In the last 15 days, the way the Aam Aadmi Party accused me, sometimes an attempt was made to cancel my nomination, sometimes an FIR was lodged against me, sometimes i was told that i would be out of the country for 240 days, then it was said That Gautam was afraid of a serious debate
 main aise logon ko ek hi baat kahana chahta hum ki jo vyakti pakistan se nahin daraa, wo inaki dibet se kya daregaa
 Gautam Gambhir has learned the nuances of politics in the last few days
 unhone ramlila maidan ke manch se kaha ki hamaare mukhyamantri ne kaha ki abhi haal hi main jo unke saath hua he, wo bijepi ne karaayaa he
 On this, Gautam said that he has not yet become such a big leader that the Bharatiya Janata Party will need to think about him
 gautam ne kaha ki pichley saadhe chaar saal ke dauraan apni naakaamiyon ko chhipaane ke liye har cheez main bijepi par aarope lagaaya gaya

 Often, when traveling in the Delhi Metro, i am surrounded by people, they are very memorable moments for me
 piem modi ne kaha ki beete 5 varshon main desh main jo bade faisle liye gaye hai, usamen aapane sadaiv meraa saath diya he

 BJP has got 105 seats
 Shiv Sena won 56 seats
 The magic figure for the government is 145
 With the changing mood of the season, political winds have also changed in Maharashtra
 teen dashak se zyada puraani dosti ko taak par rakh shivasena siyaasi dushmano ke saath haath milaane ke liye taiyaar khadi he or maharashtra main shivasena-ensipi-congress ke gathjod se sarkaar gathan ke sameekaran banate dikhaai de rahe hai
 Despite winning the most seats in this entire battle, the Bharatiya Janata Party is seen standing alone
 bijepi ne rajyapal se bhi saaf kah diya he ki uske paas apane dam par sarkaar banane ke liye paryaapt sankhya nahin he
 After this the Governor has asked NCP to form the government
 shivasena sarkaar banane ke liye taiyaar he lekin ensipi or congress ke bina aisa hona mumkin nahin he
 This is Maharashtra's number game in Maharashtra, Assembly elections were held last month, the results of which came on 24 October
 kul 288 siton main se bijepi ne 105 par jeet darj kii
 While its ally Shiv Sena won 56 seats
 vahiin, duusari taraf bijepi-shivasena ke virdohi gathbandhan congress (44) or ensipi (54) ko kul 98 siton par jeet mili
 Being the largest party, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari offered the BJP to form the government

 But the Shiv Sena is also not in a position to form the government on its own as it has just 56 seats
 halaat ye ban rahe hai ki ensipi or congress shivasena kar samarthan kar maharashtra kii nai sarkaar banawaye
 If this happens, the number rises to 144 with Shiv Sena's 56, ncp's 54 and Congress's 44 mlas
 yah sankhya jaadui aankade se zyada he
 That is, if the three parties come together, Maharashtra will get a new government

 These kinds of questions always come up

 If it is fair, if you remove me and Indian cricket starts doing good and if i am responsible for whatever is going bad in Indian cricket then i am definitely willing to step down and play as a player

 If the sale deal of domestic e-commerce company Snapdeal with its big rival Flipkart is completed, it will offer Rs 193 crore to its employees

 company ke sansthaapakon ne board se kaha he ki ve unako milane vaale niptaan bhugtan kaa aadha yani 192 karod rupee snapdil kii team ko den

 dilachasp tathy yah he ki saude se sambandhit bhugtan kaa laabh un karmchaariyaan ko bhi milegaa, jinke paas isop nahin he
 It would be an award for those employees to stay till the completion of the proposed deal with Flipkart

 It is believed that all small businessmen borrow money from corrupt politicians, officers or big businessmen who have good black money to run their daily business
 iske liye unhen oonchi byaaj bhi deni padati he
 They have to do this because of difficulty in getting loan from banks
 saath hi, cashles parchez par jiesti ke ek nishchit hisse kii cashbek jaisi yojanaon kii ghoshnaa kii ja sakati he
 This can encourage both GST and cashless transactions simultaneously

 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi came to Delhi on Sunday and congratulated the new National President of BJP, Rajnath Singh
 rajnath singh ne bhi modi ke swaagat main koi kasar baaki nahin rakhi
 The two leaders also held two-hour talks and in a short meeting with the media after the meeting ended, the two said that apart from congratulating, there was a long discussion on the 2014 election
 
 The gesture is clear that Modi's eyes are on Delhi and he is making rapid strides in this direction
 modi ne gujarat main teesri baar maidan maaraa, rajnath anischitataaon ke bich duusari baar bijepi ke sabase bade pad par baithe
 Time took a turn, the relations of politics in politics were removed
 modi achaanak dilli pahunche to bijepi ke adhyaksh ne dil kaa dareechaa bicha diya
 There was a band Baja outside Rajnath's house
 do kaddavar netaaon kii mulaakaat kaa istekabal karne waalon kii bheed thi
 When Modi came in front of Rajnath, it seemed as if two close friends were meeting after a long time
 modi ne subah-subah hi twitor par likhaa ki dilli ja rahaa hum, rajnath singh ji se milane or adhyaksh banane par unhen badhai dene
 He had also given congratulations earlier, over the telephone, but he realized that the girl came to Delhi from Ahmedabad
 din ke kareeb 12 baje narendra modi kii gaadi rajnath singh ke ghaki pahunch gai
 Rajnath Singh himself stood outside to receive Modi
 modi gaadi se utre nahin ki rajnath ne bahon main bhar kar gale se laga liya
 There is neither any Ram nor any Bharat here, but this reconciliation of politics has deteriorated in the changed time
 jaankaar maanate hai ki vakt kii jarurat hi aisi he ki rishton kii daraar ko paatna hoga
 If Delhi is important for Modi, then Rajnath Singh also has to be made important
 mulaakaat khatm hui donon netaa baahar
 
 aae
 Rajnath said something, wrote some secrets
 modi tehre unase bade ranjaitikaar so dilli aakar mulaakaat ke mudde ko gujarat lekar chale gaye
 There was a time when there was a rift between Modi and Rajnath
 wo daraar kyon padi thi
 It was Rajnath Singh who removed Narendra Modi from the parliamentary party
 narendra modi bhi isse pehle party adhyakshon ko zyada bhav nahin diya karte the
 On one hand, efforts are being made to increase the stature of Narendra Modi in the party
 duusari taraf modi ye sandesh de rahe hai ki wo khud ko sanghathan se bada nahin maanate
 BJP President is saying that Narendra Modi is the leader with the biggest support base and the world knows that it is not baseless either
 baat bas bijepi ke andarkhaane main darj karaani he
 Apart from this meeting room, there are many more closed rooms in the BJP, where the high and old walls of ambitions stand firmly

 Invited representatives of many countries including Pakistan at the swearing-in ceremony
 mulakaaton kaa daur shuru hua or ab videsh daure kaa samay he
 But the ceasefire violations on the border and the initial silence of the government on this side raised questions
 pakistan se baatcheet ko radd kar diya gaya or dragon kii dashahat kaa jawaab japan ke toji mandir se diya gaya
 Now what next What will be the government's policy with Pakistan and China between the border dispute and the politics at the center? The eighth session of Panchayat Aaj Tak was around this, 'how much love from the neighbor'
 charchaa main bijepi netaa sheshadri chaari, rajyasabha saansad va congress netaa manishankar ayyar or videsh mantralay ke purv sachiv kasee singh shaamil hue
 Question: What should be the relationship with Pakistan, what should be the conversation? Seshadri Chari: All parties believe that there should be talk with Pakistan and we believe the same
 lekin ham ye bhi kehete hai ki kuch condishan jarur honi chahie
 From the beginning we have the impression that whenever there is a dialogue on the Kashmir issue, Pakistan will talk to the Prime Minister, irrespective of the PM of any party
 kyonki ham hurriyat ko bharat sarkaar kaa pratinidhi nahin maanate hai
 Question: Pakistan has always stumbled on the issue of friendship
 aaj sadak par jaaie baccha-baccha kah rahaa he ki modi sarkaar ne baatcheet radd kar thik kiya?manishankar ayyar:videsh niti main janata sarkaar ko nahin balki sarkaar janata ko rasta dikhaati he
 It is also written in our Constitution that Parliament cannot stop the government in the matter of foreign policy
 haa, raay jarur de sakati he
 This government thought that UPA people did not do it but we will show it by doing it
 inako 10 agast ko hi pataa chal gaya tha ki pakistan ne hurriyat ko baatcheet kaa nyauta bheja he
 But he did not tell anyone
 yahaan tak ki navaj sharif ko bhi nahin bataaya
 Modi government canceled talks with Pakistan by taking Hurriyat off to get votes in Jammu
 sheshadri chaari:pakistan ko ab dhyaan rakhana hoga ki dilli main nai sarkaar he
 Times have changed unhen apane tareeke badalane honge
 Question: Modi government corrected or misunderstood the talks? Casey Singh: If talks were to break, they would have broken on some issue
 us vakt paak sena baar-baar LOC main sijafire kaa ulanghan kar rahi thi
 If the conversation was to be canceled, then it should have been done on this issue
 manishankar:modi sarkaar ko pehle hi tay kar lenaa chahie tha ki wo pakistan se dosti badhanaa chaahate hai yaa nahin
 If not to be kept, then when Sharif came here, he would give her a hug and say goodbye and take the sari that came from there to her mother and end the talk
