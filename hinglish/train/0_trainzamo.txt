 It is being alleged that i am being instigated by some people to sit on this fast
 Dear Manmohan Singh ji, this is an insult to my sense of wisdom and intelligence
 I'm not a kid that i could be "instigated" into going on an indefinite fast
 i am a fiercely independent person
 i take advice from many friends and critics, but do what my conscience directs me to do
 It is my experience that when cornered, governments resort to such malicious slandering
 i am pained that the government, rather than addressing the issue of corruption, is trying to allege conspiracies, when there are none
 2
 It is being said that i have shown impatience
 Dear Prime Minister, so far, every government has shown complete insensitivity and lack of political commitment to tackling corruption
 62 years after independence, we still do not have independent and effective anti-corruption systems
 Very weak versions of Lokpal Bill were presented in Parliament eight times in last 42 years
 Even these weak versions were not passed by Parliament
 This means, left to themselves, the politicians and bureaucrats will never pass any law which subjects them to any kind of objective scrutiny
 At a time, when the country has witnessed scams of unprecedented scale, the impatience of the entire country is justified
 And we call upon you, not to look for precedents, but show courage to take unprecedented steps
 3
 It is being said that i have shown impatience when the government has "initiated" the process
 i would urge you to tell me - exactly what processes are underway? A
 You say that your Group of Ministers are drafting the anti‐corruption law
 Many of the members of this group of ministers have such a shady past that if effective anticorruption systems had been in place, some of them would have been behind bars
 Do you want us to have faith in a process in which some of the most corrupt people of this country should draft the anti‐corruption law?b
 NAC sub ‐ committee has discussed Jan Lokpal Bill
 But what does that actually mean? Will the government accept the recommendations of NAC sub‐committee? So far, UPA II has shown complete contempt for even the most innocuous issues raised by NAC
 c
 i and many other friends from India Against Corruption movement wrote several letters to you after 1st December
 i also sent you a copy of Jan Lokpal Bill on 1st December
 We did not get any response
 It is only when i wrote to you that i will sit on an indefinite fast, we were promptly invited for discussions on 7th March
 i wonder whether the government responds only to threats of indefinite fast
 Before that, representatives of India Against Corruption had been meeting various Ministers seeking their support for the Jan Lokpal Bill
 They met Mr Moily also and personally handed over copy of Jan Lokpal to him
 a few hours before our meeting with you, we received a phone call from Mr Moily's office that the copy of Jan Lokpal Bill had been misplaced by his office and they wanted another copy
 This is the seriousness with which the government has dealt with Jan Lokpal Bill
 d
 Dear Dr Manmohan Singh ji, if you were in my place, would you have any faith in the aforesaid processes? Kindly let me know if there are any other processes underway
 If you still feel that i am impatient, i am happy that i am because the whole nation is feeling impatient at the lack of credible efforts from your government against corruption
 4
 What are we asking for? We are not saying that you should accept the bill drafted by us
 But kindly create a credible platform for discussions - a joint committee with at least half members from civil society suggested by us
 Your spokespersons are misleading the nation when they say that there is no precedent for setting up a joint committee
 At least seven laws in Maharashtra were drafted by similar joint committees and presented in Maharashtra Assembly
 Maharashtra RTI Act, one of the best laws of those times, was drafted by a joint committee
 Even at the centre, when 25,000 tribals came to Delhi two years ago, your government set up a joint committee on land issues within 48 hours
 You yourself are the Chairperson of that committee
 This means that the government is willing to set up joint committees on all other issues, but not on corruption
 Why? 5
 It is being said that the government wants to talk to us and we are not talking to them
 This is utterly false
 Tell me a single meeting when you called us and we did not come
 We strongly believe in dialogue and engagement
 Kindly do not mislead the country by saying that we are shunning dialogue
 We request you to take some credible steps at stemming corruption
 Kindly stop finding faults and suspecting conspiracies in our movement
 There are none
 Even if there were, it does not absolve you of your responsibilities to stop corruption

 Documents found on NDTV show that on 18 April 11
 55 par elahabaad se mahaprabandhak ji daure par aate hai or 48 ghante ke andar haadasa ho jaataa he
 Now the question is arising whether these seizures are representative? In 2016, 16 bogies rusting in Pukhraya of Kanpur are still witnessing the horrific accident

 The court had a direct question with the government, what plan do you have for early disposal of the cases against the public representatives
 is par sarkaar kaa kahana tha ki wo raajnneeti main apradheekaran ko kam karne ke upaay kar rahi he
 The court was probably not very satisfied with this response from the government
 lihaaja justise chellmeshwar ne kaha ki daagi netaaon yani janpratinidhiyon ke maamle saamaanya court ke mukaable fast trek court main chalaaye jaaen taaki saamaanya court par mukademon kaa boj kam ho

 The court also asked the government that how many public representatives have filed corruption cases in the last three years
 itnaa hi nahin, kitnon ko sajaa hui or kitne bari hue
 If acquitted, what was the reason behind this
 sarkaar sirf itnaa hi bataa pai ki 2014 main 1581 saansadon or vidhayakon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke mukademe darj hue the
 But the court said that the government should file a detailed reply to the questions asked in six weeks

 Therefore, going on the Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas policy, instead of appeasement of Muslims in the state, an effort will be made to strengthen their economic and social status, so that it can become mainstream in the development

 Dhoni's thumb was bleeding
 dhoni kii anguuthe se khun chuskar thukne kii tasviir bhi kaaphi viral ho rahi thi
 It is possible that Dhoni may have gone out of the field due to his injury
 lekin agar dhoni kii yah chot gambhir hui to bharat kii mushkilen or bhi bad sakati hai

 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne ise lekar apane saansadon ko vip jari kiya he
 The Modi government will depend on non-nda, non-upa parties to pass the triple talaq bill in the Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha main bahumat na hone se kai baar bijepi ko mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 The bills which are being passed easily from the Lok Sabha are getting stuck in the Rajya Sabha
 aise main yah jaananaa jaruri he ki bijepi rajyasabha main kitni taqatvar he
 The NDA does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha
 purv kendriya mantri or rajyasabha saansad arun jetali voting nahin karenge
 In such a situation, BJP alone has only 77 seats
 endie rajyasabha main 103 kii sankhya main simati he
 The Janata Dal (united), a party headed by Nitish Kumar, a BJP ally at the Center, is in favor of not voting on the triple talaq bill
 wiesar congress party bhale sahyogi nahin he lekin tripal talaak par voting nahin karegi
 AIADMK also will not vote
 biju janata dal(bijedy) teen talaak ke mudde par sarkaar ke paksh main voting karegi
 Rajya Sabha currently needs 121 votes to pass this bill
 mana ja rahaa he ki rajyasabha main wiesarsipi ke paas do saansad, jediu ke 6 saansad or ediemke ke 13 saansad rajyasabha main teen talaak par voting ke dauraan hissaa nahin lenge
 There is no information about whether the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) will participate in voting
 tiares ke kul 6 saansad hai
 Potential votes to support the bill: Bharatiya Janata Party - 78 Assam Gana Parishad - 1 Naga People's Front - 1 Republican Party of India - 1 Sikkim Democratic Front - 1 Shiv Sena - 3 Lok Janshakti Party - 1 Independents - 4 Nominee mps - 3 Biju Janata Dal - 7 So the Modi government has There are 104 votes in total
 bill ke khilaapcongress- 48trinmul congress- 13aam aadmi party- 3bahujan samaaj party- 4samaajawaadee party- 12dravin munetra kadgam- 3janata dal(secular)- 1rashtriya janata dal- 5nesanalist congress party- 4bhartiya communist party- 2bhartiya communist party marxvaadi- 5indian union muslim lig- 1kerala mani congress -1piples democratic party- 2telugu desham party- 2nirdaleey- 2namit- 1vipakshi dalon ke voton ko dekha jaae to sankhya 109 ke kareeb he
 In such a situation, the path of three divorce bills is not easy at all
 dhyaan dene vaali baat yah he ki agar partiyaan voting se gaiyr hajir rahati hai to isse rajyasabha kii sankhya kam ho jaati he
 Due to which the figure of majority also decreases

 If this happens, the path of the government will become easier in the Rajya Sabha and it will pass the triple divorce bill in the Rajya Sabha
 jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main guuruuvaar ko suraksha balon ke kafile par hue bade aatanki hamale main 37 jawan shahid ho gaye
 Pakistani terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed claimed responsibility for the attack
 yun to jaish-e-mohammad kaa naam sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad kii aatanki sanghathanon kii suchi main 2002 se hi shaamil he
 But Jaish's leader Maulana Masood Azhar is not named in the UN Global Terrorist List
 aisa isliye he kyonki suraksha parishad main vito kii takat rakhane vaala china lagaataar bharat ke prayaason kii raah main rode atka rahaa he
 After the Pulwama attack, the Foreign Ministry said in its statement that India strongly condemns this dastardly terrorist attack on its brave soldiers
 is ghrunit kaary ko pakistan samarthit aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ne anjaam diya jise sanyukt raashtra or anya deshon ne aatanki sanghathanon kii suchi main shaamil kiya he
 The leader of this terrorist group is the international militant Masood Azhar, who has been given open leeway to attack in India and elsewhere by operating and expanding on behalf of the Government of Pakistan
 videsh mantralay ne apane bayaan main antarrashtriya samudaay se ek baar phir apil kii he jaish sargana masood ajahar samet anya aatankiyon kii suchi ko sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad kii vaishvik suchi main shaamil karne or pakistan kii dharti se sanchalit aatanki sanghathanon par pratibandh lagane ke bharat ke prastaav kaa samarthan karen
 
 isse pehle disambar 2016 main modi sarkaar ne jaish-e-mohammad ke sargana moulana masood ajahar samet anya aatankiyon ko sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad kii vaishvik aatankwaadi suchi main shaamil karaane kaa prayaas kiya tha
 But at that time, he snapped India's efforts in China saying that he will veto against this proposal
 china ne is faisle ko lekar daleel di thi ki is mudde par sidhe taur se jude bharat or pakistan ke saath-saath suraksha parishad ke sadsy deshon ke bich aam raay nahin he
 However, India has the support of the permanent members of the Security Council of America, Britain and France on this issue
 lekin suraksha parishad ke niyam ke tahat sabhi sthai sadasyon kii manjuuri jaruri he
 Earlier, China had stalled on India's proposal to declare hizb-ul-mujahideen Chief Syed Salahuddin, Lashkar terrorists Abdul Rahman Makki and Ajam Cheema as global terrorists by the United Nations
 iske saath hi sanyukt raashtra ke bain ke baavjood hafiz said or jackieur rahamaan lakhvi ko pakistan main milane vaale fund ke sawaal par bhi china kaa rukh aisa hi rahaa he
 But Maulana Masood Azhar's case also becomes more serious
 kyonki wo khule taur par afghanistan main osama bin laden se mulaakaat kii baat maanane ke saath yah bhi kahata rahaa he ki wo somalia main al kaayda kii bhartee main sahyog karne gaya tha
 Apart from this, Masood Azhar has also expressed his loyalty to Taliban chief Mullah Omar
 yahi vajah rahi ki 1999 main talibani aatankiyon ne use bharat kii pakad se chhudaane ke liye kandahar vimaan hijank jaisi badi ghatana ko anjaam diya
 It is evident from these incidents that Masood Azhar's actions are not limited to India only, but he also enjoys the protection of terrorists around the world
 china ko pakistan kaa sadabahaar sahyogi mana jaataa he
 The reason for this can be attributed to India's growing strength in Southeast Asia
 lekin china bhi yah baat khuleam kahata rahaa he ki wo vaishvik aatankwaad kii ladaai main sabhi deshon ke saath khadaa he
 But terrorists like Masood Azhar, Syed Salahuddin, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi and Hafiz Saeed, who have repeatedly injured India, seem to have their arguments
 jab china bharat ke prastaav par kahata he ki chaahe ye log aatankwaadi ho yaa nahin,lekin thos tathy or saboot hone chahie
 Even if there is strong evidence, Pakistan cannot deny it
 lekin masood ajahar vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit karne ke liye paryaapt saboot ke baavjood china kaa rukh sadaiv bharat kii raah main roda atakane vaala hi rahaa he

 The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) operating in Pakistan's Balochistan province was declared a terrorist organization by the US
 ble vahi sanghathan he jo pakistan se alag hokar pruthak baluchistan raashtra kii maang karata he
 This step of America has been welcomed by Pakistan and has said that this action of America will create an atmosphere of peace in Pakistan

 The BLA is accused of carrying out several terrorist attacks in Pakistan
 inhen aatanki vaardaaton ko dekhte hue america ne yah bada kadam uthaaya he
 Pakistan had been demanding from America to declare the BLA as a terrorist organization
 mangalvaar ko america ke raksha vibhaag ne ek bayaan main kaha ki ble hathiyaarband aisa algaavvaadi sanghathan he jisane pakistan ke balooch ilaake main suraksha balon or nirdosh logon ko nishaanaa banaaya he
 According to the US statement, now supporting the BLA has now been declared a crime and the assets related to it will also be confiscated soon

 dada-daadi or naanaa-nani ke laad ke liye aksar kaha jaataa he ki asal se sood zyada pyaara hota he or yahi sneh unase kya kya nahin karvaa detaa
 An example of this was seen in Australia when a 62-year-old grandfather from India jumped in front of a train to save his 18-month-old granddaughter
 daily telegraph kii khabar ke anusaar kuch hi din pehle australia aae dada sidney ke ek railway stesan par achaanak train ke saamne kud pade, jab unki potee kaa pram galati se railway trek ke saamne aa gaya
 Dada jumped on the track and quickly picked up Pram and placed him in the hands of his wife and the girl's mother standing on the platform, but he himself could not get a chance to climb on the platform
 teji se aati train ko dekhakar vah trek par aage kii or daudane lage or mauka milte hi plateform par chadh gaye
 It is being told that the family had left their house to visit the gurudwara when CCTV cameras installed at the station captured this 'bravery' incident
 kharaab mausam kii vajah se wentwarthvil stesan ke plateform kii dhalaan treks kii taraf ho rahi he
 The comments bacchee ke chachaa parminder singh ne media se baat karte hue kaha ki dadaji ne bahut hi bahaduree kaa kaam kiya he, bacchee ko bachaane ke liye wo apni jaan kii parvaah kiye bagaiyr kud pade

 sidney trains ke diarector of oparations toni aid ne kaha ki jald hi stesan kii marammat kii jaaegi, taaki is tarah kii durghatnaayen dobaaraa naa ghaten
 The Daily Telegraph reported that a few days ago, Dada, who arrived in Australia, suddenly jumped in front of a train at a railway station in Sydney when his granddaughter's pram accidentally hit the railway track
 dada ne trek par kudakar badi hi furti se pram ko uthaaya or plateform par khadi apni patni or bacchee kii maa ke haath main thama diya, lekin khud unhen plateform par chadhane kaa mauka nahin mil paaya
 Seeing the fast train, he started to run further on the track and climbed on the platform as soon as he got a chance
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ye parivaar gurudware darshan ke liye apane ghar se niklaa tha, jab stesan par lage sisitivi camere ne is 'bahaduree' ghatana ko kaid kar liya
 Wentworthville station platforms are sloping towards the tracks due to inclement weather
 tippaniyan Talking to the media, the girl's uncle Parminder Singh said that Dadaji has done a lot of bravery, he jumped without caring for his life to save the girl
 bacchee or uske dada ko halki chot ai thi or kuch ghante baad unhen aspataal se chuttee bhi mil gai
 Sydney Trains director of operations Tony Ed said the station would be repaired soon so that such accidents do not occur again

 gujarat main duusare charan ke liye guruuvar ko vot daale jaaenge
 Earlier on Wednesday, Congress President Rahul Gandhi's interview given to Gujarati channel aired
 is par bhartiya janata party ne aapatti jataai he
 The Gujarat BJP has termed the interview in the Election Commission a violation of the code of conduct
 aapako bataa den ki rahul gandhi kaa gujarati channel ko die intervyuu main bhartiya janata party par jamkar hamalaa bolaa tha
 In the interview, Rahul said that the election of Gujarat is going to be one sided
 unhone kaha ki congress netaaon ne mujhe gujarat main zyada campan karne ko manaa kiya tha lekin mujhe kaam main intrest he, rigelt main nahin
 It is written in Gita: Do work, don't worry about the fruit
 main usee ko maanata hum
 Rahul said that the Congress party is an old-minded party, the BJP has no vision in Gujarat
 modi ne gujarat kii janata ke saamne koi vijan nahin rakh sake hai
 Modi either kept talking or kept talking about the Congress but he did not say anything for Gujarat
 rahul ne kaha ki mere mandir jane par kya koi manaahi he? rahul ne kaha ki bijepi ke log ye mudda uthaate hai
 Can i go bijepi ye dyside karegi
 i went to the temple in Kedarnath
 ye to main karata hum, bijepi ko ghabrahat ho rahi he, dar rahe hai
 Is extracting some issue
 gujarat samaj gaya he ki vikaas kii baat nahin ho rahi he
 The issue was not found in front of them
 bhavishya par bolne se bhaag jate hai
 The truth has come out
 aapako bataa den ki gujarat main duusare charan ke liye 14 disambar ko vot daale jaaenge
 In this phase, votes will be cast in 93 seats in 14 districts
 is charan main gujarat ke upmukhyamantri nitin patel, kowshik patel, alpesh thakor, jignesh mewaani or siddharth patel jaisi badi hastiyon kii kismat daanv par he
 On December 9, 68 percent polling was held for the first phase
 Fear is now rampaging through Mr Modi's mind
 He can't sleep
 He stole 30,000cr from the IAF and gave it to Anil Ambani
 Sacking the CBI Chief # alokverma twice in a row, clearly shows that he is now a prisoner of his own lies
 Satyamev Jayate
 BJP leader Subramanian Swamy said that if there was a majority decision to remove Verma, it is unfortunate
 unhone kaha, "mujhe nahin pataa ki verma ko unke khilaaf aaropon kaa jawaab dene ke liye kyon nahin kaha gaya
 My opinion about the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) is very poor
 "varisht vakil prashanth bhushan ne pradhanmantri kii bhoomika main 'hiton ke takaraav' kii baat kahi kyonki pradhanmantri us teen sadasyeey samiti kaa hissaa hai jisane verma ko pad se hataaya he
 It consists of Justice A
 Nominee nominated by the Chief Justice, nominated representative of the Supreme Court and Mallikarjun Kharge, the leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha
 ke
 Are Sikri
 Breaking! So, a day after he resumed charge as CBI Director, the Committee headed by Modi again transfers out Alok Verma post haste, w / o even hearing him, fearing the prospect of his registering an FIR against Modi in the Rafale scam! Such desperation to prevent any investigationeka anya varisht vakil va rajyasabha sadsy majid memon ne verma ko hataane ko 'satta kaa atikaraman' qaraar diya
 Memon said, "the selection committee's decision against Alok Verma is a complete 'encroachment of power'
" samiti ko unki baat sunani chahie thi
 The role of the CVC in the case is also under suspicion
 "congress netaa va varisht vakil abhishek singhvi ne kaha ki yah durbhagyapurna he ki verma ko aaropon ke aadhaar par hataa diya gaya, jabaki sivisi kii koi vishwasaneeyata nahin he
 He said, "the Prime Minister is apprehensive that a lot of evidence will come out when there is an inquiry against him" # alokverma 6 of 10 charges nt made out; the 4relied upon have no findings; mere adjectives like behaviour nt upto mark, suspicion etc; if mere allegations were enuff wld # PM or # Amitshah step down on surmises & allegations
 Remove CBI director wo hearing wo finding wo proof! Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's chair may be in danger
 unke khilaaf lahore hai court main ek yachika daakhil kii gai he, jisamen pakistani piem imran khan ko ayogy qaraar dene kii maang kii gai he
 In this petition, Imran Khan has been accused of not being 'honest and virtuous' as well as hiding the fact that a daughter is the father of a daughter in the nomination papers of the 2018 general election
 lahore hai court is maamle main sunwaayee ke liye raji ho gaya he
 The Pakistani court will hear the petition disqualifying Imran Khan on Monday
 yachika main daleel di gai he ki imran khan ne pakistan ke samvidhan ke anuchhed 62 or 63 kaa ulanghan kiya he
 Therefore, they should be disqualified
 pakistani samvidhan ke anuchhed 62 or 63 main sansad sadsy ke liye 'sadik or amin' (eemaandaar or dharmaparayan) hone kii shart lagaai gai he
 According to Pakistani newspaper Dawn, the petition described Tyran z Khan White, daughter of ana-louisa (sita) White, as Imran Khan's daughter
 imran khan ne saal 2018 ke aam chunaav main apane namakan patr main tyrian jed khan white ke kathith pita hone kii baat chhipaai thi
 Sita White is being described as Imran Khan's former girlfriend
 isko lekar pehle bhi kai baar imran khan se sawaal poocha ja chukaa he, lekin unhone is par kabhi koi jawaab nahin diya
 Apart from this, Sita White also described her daughter Tyrian z Khan White as the biological father of Imran Khan
 sita white rais kaarobaari lord gordon white kii beti hai
 Although he is no longer in this world
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki lord gordon white ne kaha tha ki agar unki beti sita white ne imran khan se shaadi kii, to usko wo apni sampatti se ek paisa bhi nahin denge
 After this, Imran Khan and Sita White were not married
 shanivaar ko lahore hai court ne imran khan ke khilaaf daayar is yachika ko sweekaar kar liya he
 Now the matter will be heard on 11 March
 isse pehle bhi imran khaane ke liye tyrian jed khan white ko lekar yachika daakhil kii ja chuki he
 However, the court rejected the petition filed against him
 ab imran khan ke khilaaf nai yachika us samay daakhil kii he, jab bharat or pakistan ke bich tanaav chal rahaa he
 Let us tell you that on February 14, there was a suicide attack on CRPF in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir
 isaki jimmedaari pakistan sthit aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ne lee thi
 After this, India entered Balakot in Pakistan and carried out an air strike on the terrorist camps of jaish-e-mohammed
 isamen 280 se zyada aatankiyon ke maare jane kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 After this action of India, Pakistan tried to target the Indian military bases, which was thwarted by the Indian Air Force
 saath hi pakistan ke F-16 ladaaku vimaan ko maar giraaya tha
 The saint's costume in front of the world and the surrender of the world-the indecent gang of surrender
 asaram or narayan sai saalon-saal logon kii ankhon main dhul jhonkkar ashleelata ke wo gang chalaate rahe, jisamen funskar namaaloom kitni ladkiyaan barbaad ho gayi
 Both of them had not only distributed their share of work to every henchman working in their gang, but also used to reward them for punishment and success if they missed work
 stage par pehle paakhand kaa solo parformens hua karata tha
 Asaram used to give knowledge alone
 lekin dharm-karm kii ye dukaan jab chal nikali to baba ne apane laadle narayan sai ko bhi dhandhe main utaar diya
 Devotees saw God in their Lord's son as well and Asaram's hypnotic eyes read the market among the devotees, but when on the stage, Asaram trained Narayan Sai to run a sex gang in a white chola
 Granted, the devotees who saw Baba stare at him did not know
 baap-bete kii ye kaali karatuut shaayad kabhi jamaane ke saamne nahin aati, agar asaram ke khilaaf dilli main yon shoshan kaa mukadmaa darj naa hua hota
 Now during the investigation, the things that the police are getting to know about these father-sons, they are going to raise the color
 asaram kaa gang or unke kamshiva, shilpi, prakaash, lakshmi, bharti, dhruvaben
 Although Asaram's gang was much bigger, but it is a few names whose actions have now become clear like glass in front of the police
 pehle do naam yani shiva or shilpi par jahaan ladakiyon ko fanskar asaram ke kalank kii kutiyaa tak laane kii jimmedaari thi, jabaki asaram kaa rasoiyaa prakaash ladakiyon ko dhokhe se opium vaala doodh pilaataa or unke shoshan ke dauraan kutiyaa par najar rakhata
 At the same time, after the exploitation of the girls, Asaram's wife Lakshmi and daughter Bharati used to shut their mouth on these girls
 or thik isi tarah asaram kii karatuut se agar kisi ladki kaa garbh thahar jaataa, to asaram kii khaas sadhika dhruv ben un ladakiyon kaa garbhpaat karwaati thi
 Narayan Sai's gang and gang members Kamhohit Bhojwani, Hanuman, Monica, Dharmesh
 ye gang bhi satsang ke naam par ladakiyon ko narayan sai kii kutiyaa tak laane main laga rahata
 Though Narayan Sai does not pick a girl like Asaram by any gesture or flashlight, he would call his favorite girl repeatedly in his satsang and then invite satsang in solitude
 agar ladki ye nyauta or nazdikiyaan kubul kar leti to phir narayan sai kaa gang uskaa brinwash shuru kar detaa
 But if a girl were to open her mouth against this fraud, then it would have been so terrible that people would have been shocked
 ab ek-ek kar baap bete ke sex gang ke gurgon ko pakadakar police tamaam kadiyaan jod rahi he, lekin tafteesh ko anjaam tak pahunchane ke liye narayan sai ke shikanje main aana ab sabase badi jarurat he
 a month later, the missing family surfaced
 Asaram was booked for sexual exploitation and a girl studying in his ashram and his entire family mysteriously disappeared
 or to or rishtedaar bhi is parivaar ko dhundhate rah gaye
 The suspicion was on Asaram itself, but now after a month, when the same family suddenly appeared in front of the world, the matter turned out to be even more shocking
 ye gumshudagi jitani ajeeb thi
 This comeback is that much drama
 ye shaq jitna gaharaa tha, ye safaai utani chhichhli he
 It was suspected that Asaram had gone missing the family of Meerut, who had a daughter studying in the same Chhindwara ashram of Asaram where Asaram had sexually abused the girl in Jodhpur, to cover up his misdeeds
 jaahir he, yon shoshan ke maamle main is ladki ke ek ahm gavaah sabit hone ummid banane lagi thi
 And the victim girl had also mentioned this girl in her statement
 par, isse pehle ki police is ladki or uske gharavaalon ke bare main kuch pataa laga paati, ye puraa kaa puraa parivaar behad rahasyamayi tareeke se gaayab ho gaya
 Studied in Asaram's glory, the family disappeared from Meerut after about a month, this family was revealed in Mainpuri
 or naa keval pragat ho gaya, balki is ladki ke pita ne sabake saamne aate hi asaram kii shaan main kaside padhakar un tamaam baton par mitti daal di, jisamen kaha ja rahaa tha ki asaram ne hi raaj khulne ke dar se is ladki or uske parivaar ko kahin gaayab karvaa diya he
 In fact, the girl who had filed a sexual abuse report against Asaram had told the police that in those days, Shilpi was trying to increase her closeness even with this girl studying with her in the ashram of Chhindwara
 lihaaja, uske paas bhi asaram or shilpi ke kai raaj dafan ho sakate hai
 Asaram must have breathed a sigh of relief! Only then did the family go missing in such a way that even the relatives living in its neighborhood did not know about them
 ab is ladki ke pita ne mainpuri main logon se kaha ki wo apane gaanv main hi the or un par asaram kii taraf se koi dabaav nahin tha
 However, in Mainpuri itself, the president of the Mainpuri Bar Association, who was advocating a land possession case against Asaram, termed it as the effect of Asaram's money and pressure
 baharhaal, ab is parivaar ke saamne aane ke saath hi asaram ke haq main bolne par asaram ne thodi chaiyn kii saans jarur lee hogi

 If you are installing the lingavatar of Lord Shiva in your house by not installing it, then it is important to know and understand some things first
 pandit binod mishra ke anusaar ghar main shivlinga sthapit karne kaa niyam he
 It is believed that Shivling is not established indoors
 phir bhi agar aap sthapit karnaa chaahate hai to in baton kaa jarur rakhen
 
 
 Must visit Shri Siddhivinayak Temple located in Mumbai 1
 shivlinga kii sthapana kabhi bhi tulsi ji ke saath na karen
 Lord Shaligram is established with Tulsi Maa
 kuch jataka tulsi ke saath shivlinga sthapit karne kii bhul karte hai
 Do not forget this work in the worship of mother
 
 
 2
 Never install the Shivling in a closed place
 masalan, kamare ke andar agar mandir he to vahaan shivlinga sthapit na karen
 Install on open space only
 3
 Shivaji loves cleanliness very much
 wo saadagi se par shanti se dhyaan karne main bharosa rakhte hai
 Therefore, the place to install Shivalinga should not be such that where worship can not be done
 nahin mil rahi manachaahi naukari, to raashi anusaar karen ye upaay4
 The most important thing is that the height of the Shivling installed in the house is equal to the tip above the thumb
 usase bada nahin hona chahie
 a larger Shivalinga can create an orgy in the house
 5
 Do not set up Shivling alone
 gauri or ganesh ji kii pratimaa bhi saath main rakhen

 iske saath unhone shikaayat bhare lahaze main kaha, meraa maananaa he ki jin sharton ke saath jammu-kashmir bharat main shaamil hua tha, jitani shakti kii maang hamane centre se kii he, vah ek aisa maamla he jo charchaa ke liye maujuud he, lekin bharat main vilay ko lekar charchaa nahin ho sakati
 He refused to get into the issue of the number of security forces present in the state, saying that the number of 6-7 lakhs which are often spoken by Pakistan is wrong
 'afsapa ke dauraan nahin hua maanavadhikaar kaa ulanghan'umr ne afsapa (armd forcej special power act) ke bare main kaha ki sena ko aantarik suraksha se jude kartavyon kaa nirvahan karne ke liye kanoonee sweekruti kii jarurat hoti he, lekin iske or afsapa (armd forcej special power act) ke tahat mil rahe purna adhikaar ke bich antar hota he
 He rejected Amnesty International's claim that human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir have been planned
 umr ne sweekaar kiya ki 25 saal ke aatankwaad ke daur main maanavadhikaar ke ulanghan kii ghatnaayen hui hai, lekin ye suniyojit nahi hai
 When asked about his promise to form the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Omar said that he never made such a promise, but gave him an idea while in opposition
 unhone kaha ki is tarah ke kisi bhi ayog ke gathan kaa vichaar bharat or pakistan kii sarkaron kii ore se vishwaas bahaali ke kadam ke taur par diya ja saktaa he
 The Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir said, there is a need for a response from both sides on the Line of Control
 samasya yah he ki jo kuch bhi hota he uske liye ham aksar bhartiya paksh ko jimmedaar tehra dete hai
 We do not want to ask questions from the other side of the Line of Control
 main ayog ke paksh main hum
 Asked if Jammu and Kashmir are among the most dangerous places in the world, Omar replied, no, not at all
 na to aantarik pariprekshya se or na hi bahari pariprekshya se aisa he
 "terrorist threat has reduced in Kashmir" Omar said that after the complete withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan this year, he does not see the threat of large scale terrorists coming into Kashmir
 unase sawaal kiya gaya ki alqaida sargana ayman al jawahiri ne kashmir main nae jehad kaa elaan kiya he to umr ne kaha, mere paas uplabdh khufia jaankaree se main aisa hota nahin dekhtaa hum, lekin adhik satark rahane kii jarurat he
 Asked if he was trying to say that the danger was being exaggerated, the Chief Minister said, to some extent
 iske saath hi unhone kaha ki 2014 main is daleel kaa istemaal kiya gaya he taaki afsapa (armd forcej special power act) maujuuda sthiti main bana rahe
 Asked about the evidence of Pakistani help for terrorism in the state, 'musharraf's model on Jammu and Kashmir is correct', he said that there is a terror training camp there and the pictures attached to it across the border show it
 parvej musharraf ke shasankaal main jammu-kashmir vaarta par sambhavit samjhaute ke bare main sawaal kiye jane par umr ne kaha ki general se bada mauka kho diya
 But if the current Nawaz Sharif government agrees on Musharraf's four-point program, we will be very close to a solution
 unhone kaha ki sharif vyapaar or dwipaksheeya sambandhon kii baat kar rahe hai, lekin kashmir ke bare main ek shabd bhi nahin bolte hai
 No such evidence has been found from Pakistan which suggests that it is in favor of negotiating for a permanent solution
 pichley dinon ek janaaje ke dauraan umr kii tippanee ko lekar jab sawaal poocha gaya to unhone kaha, meraa matlab yah nahin he ki main samvidhan ke baahar samaadhaan kaa pairokaar hum
 i am asking the security forces for accountability
 jammu-kashmir par bharat dwaara liye gaye aitihaasik faisle ke bich videsh mantri es
 Jaishankar met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Li in Beijing on Monday
 bharat ke faisle se baukhalaaye pakistan ne duniya ke kai deshon ke saamne guhaar lagaai, jisamen china bhi shaamil rahaa
 The issue of Kashmir also arose in the meeting between the two foreign ministers, but Foreign Minister S
K
 jaishankar ne china ko kuch aisa tark diya ki china aage kuch nahin kah paaya
 When the matter of removing Section 370 from Jammu and Kashmir and reorganizing the state came up during the meeting of the two, Foreign Minister S
K
 jaishankar ne kaha ki bharat ne jo faisla liya he vah uske samvidhan ke tahat he or usase na to pakistan kii seemaa par koi asar hota he or na hi china kii
 China had questioned India's decision to make Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh a union territory and said that this could affect regional integrity
 saajha press vaarta main videsh mantri es
 Jaishankar said, 'aksai Chin issue also arose during the talks, China was worried that Article 370 might affect the indo-china border
 lekin, unhone saaf kiya ki bharat kaa faisla antarrashtriya seemaa par kuch asar nahin daalega
 This will affect the state only within India
 gauratlab he ki jammu-kashmir par faisle ke baad pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi bhi china pahunche the, lekin china ne is masale par shanti kaa rasta hi apanaaya
 China had said in its statement that they are aware of India's decision, they hope that it will lead to peace in the region

 Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi had also mentioned in a press conference that it is not so easy to explain the issue of Kashmir in front of the world and do it in its own right
 saaf he ki pakistan kii baat koi bhi desh maanane ko taiyaar nahin he or har koi is faisle ko bharat kaa aantarik masalaa bataa rahaa he
 While many countries of the world are troubled by the problem of increasing population, there are some countries in the world where the population is decreasing
 inhen main se ek he srbija
 The population of this country has grown to 7 million
 isliye ab aabaadi badhaane ke liye tamaam prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 Recently a new slogan has been launched to increase the population in Serbia - Do not delay, have children! Another slogan is- 'let's listen to the caricature of children
 ’ duusari ore, desh kii mahilaon kaa kahana he ki unhen aabaadi badhaane ke liye behatar sahyog chahie naa ki mahaj preranadayak shabd
 Many people are leaving the country in Serbia and with this the birth rate is also falling fast
 desh main ausatan har do parivaar main teen bachche hai jo europe main sabase kam he or isse srbija kii aabaadi girakar 70 lakh logon par pahunch gai he
 The United Nations estimates that by 2050, Serbia's population may be reduced by as much as 15 percent
 2030 tak aabaadi ke maamle main china ko bhi peeche chhod degaa bharatkam bachche paidaa karne kii pravriti ko dur karne ke liye srbian adhikariyon ne anek prastaav die he isamen june main ghoshit ek yojana bhi shaamil he
 According to the plan, houses with lower floors will be built in those areas where the rate of children is low
 raashtrapati elexander vukik ne kaha ki yah ek adhyayan par aadhaarit he jisamen pataa chalaa he ki do se chaar manjila gharon main rahane vaale danpatiyon main bachche paidaa karne kii dar doguna zyada he
 In addition, new maternity care laws have been passed to motivate women to have more children
 17 saal main bhartiya kisaanon kii aamadani main 45 lakh karod rupee kii kamizidipi growth main giravat kii ek pramukh vajah khapat main kami kaa hona bhi hegramin ilaakon ke 70 fisadi parivaar ab bhi jeevika ke liye kheti par nirbharajtil regulation or pratibandhaatmak vyapaar nitiyon kii vajah se krishi aay main kamiaarthik tarakkee ko gati dene ke maamle main aksar krishi ko nazarandaaj kar diya jaataa he
 a good example of this is the recent announcements made by the government - corporate tax cuts, merger of banks, recapitalization of banks, reduction in GST, increasing depreciation of vehicles, etc
 in ghoshnaaon main kheti ke liye pratyaksh taur par to kuch bhi nahin dikh rahaa he
 This is ironic because agriculture is still the biggest source of livelihood in India, and the reduction in consumption, especially in rural areas, is largely due to agriculture
 jidipi kii raftaar main giravat kii ek pramukh vajah khapat main kami kaa hona bhi he
 According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the highly dependent, low-income United Nations, 70 percent of rural households in India still depend mainly on the agricultural sector for 'livelihood'
 iconomic survey 2017-18 ke mutabik bharat ke kul workforce yani kaamgaar varg main 49 fisadi hissaa krishi kshetra kaa hi he, lekin kul aay (GDP) main iskaa hissaa mahaj 16 fisadi hi he
 a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) report quoted the International Labor Organization (ILO) as saying that the share of agriculture in the country's total employment has come down to 44 per cent in FY 2018
 isi tarah rigerv bank ke anumaan ke ansur vitt varsh 2019 main desh kii rashtriya aay main krishi kshetra kaa kul hissaa 14
 Only 4 percent is left
 in sabakaa matlab yah he ki krishi ab bhi zyaadaatar logon kii jeevika kaa saadhan he
 However its share in national income 22 of FY 2005
 6 fisadi se ghatakar 2019 main 14
 4 percent is left
 is hisaab se krishi main kam growth rate gahari chintaa kaa vishay he
 a comparative analysis shows that the average average growth rate in agricultural GVA between FY 2006 to 2019 has been only half of the total GVA of the economy
 kisaanon kii aay badhaane main anakanito sawaal uthta he ki aakhir kheti lagaataar kam aay vaali gatividhi kyon bana hua he? bharat main krishi nitiyon kii samiksha karne vaali saal 2018 kii OECD-ICRIER study se is bare main sahi jawaab miltaa he: kisaanon kii aay badhaane main anakani
 It states that despite all the subsidies (on fertilizers, electricity, irrigation etc
), India's gross income is declining due to complex market regulations and restrictive trade policies of India
 iskaa akalan produsar saport estimate (PSE) ke dwaara kiya jaataa he, jo upabhoktaaon or taxperes dwaara krishi utpaadakon ko hone vaale salanaa sakal hastantaran ke maudrik mulya kaa sanketak hota he
 According to the study, during 2000 to 2016, the PSE for India was minus (-) 14% of the gross agricultural receipts
 is study main shaamil ICRIER ke professor ashok gulati ke mutabik iskaa matlab yah he ki bhartiya kisaanon ko har saal 2
 Income of 65 lakh crore rupees has been reduced (at the prices of 2017-18) and in 17 years it has reduced the total income of farmers by 45 lakh crores
 unhone ise ‘kisaanon kii aamadani kii lut’ bataaya he
 Its implications are very clear
 pratibandhaatmak upayon ko khatm hona chahie
 Although there are many suggestions in this study, Professor Gulati insists on two: 1
 aavashyak jins adhinium (ECA) or krishi utpaada vipanan samiti (APMC) ko khatm kiya jaae, kyonki ye donon pratibandhaatmak hai or inaki vajah se behatar keemat hasil nahin hone paati 2
 Direct income support should be provided by providing the entire cost to the farmers and eliminate the price policy approach (eg input subsidy, interest rebate, crop insurance etc
)
 nijee nivesh main giravatakam growth kii ek vajah kam nivesh bhi he
 National Agriculture Policy Since 2000, it has been trying to improve investment, especially in private investment
 lekin aadhikarik aankadon se yah pataa chalata he ki vitt varsh 2012 se 2017 ke bich saarvajanik niveshak lagbhag sthir hi he (jidipi kaa 0
 3 to 0 4 fisadi), jabaki nijee nivesh 2
 1 to 7 per cent
 8 fisadi rah gaya he, jisase is dauraan kul nivesh jidipi ke 3
 1 to 2 per cent
 2 fisadi rah gaya he
 This is also evident from the data on the decline in debt flow since 2009
 dirghakaalik karj main giravatkul karj main giravat kii vajah se nivesh ke liye bhi kam karj mil paa rahaa he
 According to the report released in September 2019 of the Reserve Bank's Internal Working Committee set up to review agricultural credit, the short-term loan share has increased due to the interest subvention scheme that began in FY 2007
 intrest subvension yani byaaj chhot kaa lakshya tha short turm lone (paidaavaar kii jaruraton ke liye) ko badhaava dena, lekin isse long turm lone (nivesh kii jaruraton ke liye) main giravat ai he
 Scam in agricultural loans! It was found in the report of internal working group of RBI that some states have got loans on agriculture much more than their entire agricultural GDP, which is an indication that such loans can be applied to other non-agricultural operations
 Used to be
 kuch udhaaharan is prakaar hai: kerala (krishi jidipi ke 180 % se bhi zyada), tamilnadu (170 se 180% zyada), telugana or punjab (100% se zyada)
 Many states have received loans much higher than their total input costs
 udhaaharan ke liye andhra pradesh (7
 5 times), Kerala (6 times), Goa (5 times), Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Uttarakhand (4 times)
 isaki vajah se aise karj ke istemaal par sawalia nishaan khadey ho gaye hai
 Professor Gulati says that this is happening due to the huge difference in interest rate between agriculture sector and other sectors
 short turm ke fasal lone par kisaanon ko 7 fisadi kii riyayati byaaj dar par lone miltaa he, isamen bhi 2 fisadi kaa byaaj chhot or 3 fisadi kaa samay se purv bhugtan protsaahan miltaa he, jisaki vajah se prabhavi byaaj dar mahaj 4 fisadi ho jaati he
 In comparison, the interest rate in other areas is 10 percent or more
 unhone chetavanee di ki jab tak yah khai bani rahegi krishi karj kaa duusare kaaryon main istemaal jari rahegaa
 Policy steps: Half-heartedly and piecemeal the main thrust in terms of ending the agrarian crisis in recent years, raising the Minimum Support Price (MSP), increasing the allocation for the Rural Employment Scheme (MGNREGS) and the annual income transfer of Rs 6,000 to farmers (pm-kisan Yojana)
 lekin saal 2018 main yah dekha gaya ki emspi badhaane se puure desh ke krishi bazaaron main paidaavaar kii keemton main kaaphi giravat aa gai, jisase iskaa mul uddeshy hi puraa nahin hua
 MGNREGS i
e
 MNREGA is in difficulty due to two reasons: 1
 iske tahat milane vaali mazdooree sambandhit rajyon kii nunatam mazdooree se kam he, 2
 In the last few years, it has been observed that the budgetary allocation of the central government has been less than the actual expenditure
 kam mazdooree chintaa kii baat he, kyonki yah kareeb aadhe gramin pariwaron kii aay kaa strot hoti he- NABARD ke 2016-17 ke akhil bhartiya gramin vittiya samavesh survey ke mutabik krishi pariwaron ke 34 fisadi or gaiyr krishi pariwaron ke 54 fisadi kaa
 As far as the PM Kisan Yojana is concerned, the poorest people in the country are out of it - agricultural laborers, who constitute 55% of the total agricultural workforce, while the farmers are only 45% of it

 dekhen-sunen gaanaa nakhrile After President Pratibha Devisingh Patil's call to the Naxals to drop arms, the Maoists have called for the army to stop training in Bastar region and withdraw paramilitary forces from Maoist-affected areas
 communist party (maovadi) kii kendriya cameti ke pravaktaa abhaya ne media ko jari vijyapti main kaha he ki raashtrapati kaa prastaav aise samay main aayaa he jab bhartiya sena ke kareeb ek hajaar jawan bastar kshetra ke teen jilon main apana padaav daal chuke hai tathaa rajya ke prakritik sansadhano (ke dohan) ke liye lakhon karodon rupe ke samjhauta gyaapan ho chuke hai
 The Maoists have accused the armed forces in the state of persecuting the tribals along with the rising inflation in the country as a form of violence
 unhone sarkaar par unki party ke paulitte beuro sadsy aaazaad kii hatya karaane kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 The release accused the Maoists of torturing the jailed Maoist leaders and asked the public to demand from the President to stop army training in Bastar and withdraw the army and paramilitary forces from Maoist-affected areas
 unhone kaha he ki yadi sarkaar iske liye taiyaar hoti he to duusare hi din se janata kii ore se aatmaraksha main kii ja rahi javaabi hinsa tham jaaegi
 The Maoists also demanded the cancellation of the Memorandum of Understanding between the government and the business houses and punished the corrupt people publicly
 chhattisgarh kii rajdhani raipur main is maheene kii 24 taarikh ko raashtrapati pratibha patil ne naksaliyon se aahvaan kiya tha ki ve hinsa chhod baatcheet kaa rasta apanaayen or vikaas kii mukhyadhara main shaamil hokar adivasee janata kii pragati ke liye kaary karen
 Patil had said that Chhattisgarh is facing the problem of Naxalism in the same way as some other states
 pichley kuch samay ke dauraan naksalwadi hinsa kii kai durbhagyapurna ghatnaayen saamne ai jinamein bahut si amuly jane gai hai
 He had said that no matter how big the problem is, it can be solved by dialogue and dialogue
 hinsa or hatya nindaneey aparaadh he or inhen kisi bhi sa5ya samaaj main sweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The President had said during this time, i would call upon the Naxalites and all other people engaged in violence to give up violence, have a dialogue, think appropriately and feasibly and join the mainstream of development and the path of progress of our tribal people
 Make it easy
 pradhanmantri ne aaj hi saansad adarsh gram yojana kii shuruyaat kii he
 What kind of apprehension is there in the minds of the mps about this scheme, it came up in the conversation with them
 pesh he baatcheet kaa byoraa
 
 
 It was a few days ago
 bijepi ke ek saansad se kahin mulaaqaat ho gai
 After the initial greetings and talks here and there, i said that your government is doing well
 number bhi puure 282 hai
 There is a government of its own, so there is also no allied party to lame
 isliye aaplogon ke kaamkaaz main kisi rukaawat kaa koi chakkar hi nahin he
 Everyone seems to be moving in fun and strength
 mujhe nahin pataa tha ki meraa aisa kahana unki kisi dukhati rag ko chhu jayega
 His anger broke
 
 
 are sahab hamaara kaam kya khak maze main chalegaa
 We have no question
 acha hota ki ham 282 kii bajaay 12-14 kam hote
 There would have been 268
 tab ek-ek saansad kaa mahatv hamaari sarkaar ko pataa hota
 Then we would also be heard
 abhi to haalat yah he ki koi kaam lekar kisi mantri ke paas jaao, to sunata hi nahin
 It says that it cannot, it cannot
 iske liye modi ji se poochna hoga, uske liye unase parmishan leni padegi
 The MP said further, and what should i tell you
 apane kshetra main skool, college kholane se lekar ilaake ke logon kii transafar, posting tak kisi bhi kaam ke liye smriti irani ji ke paas koi bhi saansad jaataa he, to vah manaa kar detii hai
 Try to emphasize a little too, then take the phone in your hand and say what should i talk to Modi ji
 ab ham tehre bhala chote aadmi
 What will Modi talk to? apni fil-fattar lekar waapas chale aate hai
 The MP was speaking non-stop
 kehane lage ki jivan mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 Go to the area, then people ask for work
 kaam yahaan ho nahin rahaa
 Above all the MP has been given the responsibility of making a model village in his area
 puraa saansad nidhi bhi jhonk de, to adarsh gaanv nahin ban saktaa
 On top of this, people are trying to name their village for Adarsh village
 nahin maanane par naaraaz hote hai
 By stopping the mp's talk, i tried to know in the middle that what is the problem in deciding the lottery in front of everyone
 unhone kaha, are sahab lottery koun maanata he
 We found a straight path
 jhanjhat se bachane ke liye hamane ek gaanv kaa naam tay kar ye kah diya ki modi ji ne final kiya he
 Why should we bear it on our head when we don't have anything in our hands? lekin isamen bhi dar ye he ki agali baar jab duusare gaanvon main vot maangane jaaenge, to vahaan ke log ye na kahen ki jaao jis gaanv ko modi ji ne final kiya, usee gaanv se vot maango
 Even if we build five model villages in five years, you will not win with the vote of only five villages
 saansad ye bhi maanate hai ki modi ji ke disha nirdesh ke peeche manshaa acchhee he
 They also want major changes in rural areas
 gaanvvaalon kii zindagi behatar bananaa chaahate hai
 But where will the resource come from, how much will come from it
 agar sirf saansad nidhi ke bharose hi karnaa hoga, to puure sansadeey kshetra ke duusare kaam kahaan se honge
 If you extract Rs 5 crore in a year directly, then only a five kilometer long road can be built
 saansad mahoday ne ye bhi kaha ki is chunaav main kitna paisa kharch hua he
 Also, you have to go to the right election only after 5 years
 uske liye kuch chahie
 Not right with two numbers, one way with only one number
 paisa to chahie hi hota he chunaav main
 The MP also told how the candidate spent crores of rupees against whom he has won the election
 agali baar bhi isi tarah ke ummidavaaron se paar paanaa hoga
 It is fine to curb corruption and commissioning, but to save our politics in the area, it is important that the people of the area do their work
 sir par danda latakaane or neeche talwaar kii dhar par chalaane se to kaam nahin chalegaa na
 The mp's direct complaint is not with Modi ji at the moment
 balki un mantriyon se thi, jo yaa to modi ji ke prabhamandal kaa istemaal kar yaa phir unka dar dikhaakar saansadon ke saath pesh aa rahe hai
 Modi ji, who is aware of everything, is not aware that such a thing will not be known
 lekin yaa to wo apni zimmedaariyon main itane vyast he ki saansadon kii sudhi lene kaa philhal vakt nahin, yaa phir unhen ye abhi utana zaruri nahin lagata
 However, after talking to some mps, it is learned that they have given confidence to the mps that a lot will happen by the next time they go to the polls, so that they will be able to reach the voters of their own constituency with more confidence
 ek patrkaar ke taur par abhi tak aam logon kii samasyaon ko suna karata tha
 For the first time, the mp's problem was heard in this way
 laga ki jab ek saansad itnaa laachaar mahasoos kar rahaa he to wo apane kshetra kii janata ko kya de paaegaa
 Only through word of mouth, it will not work
 kai bahut vyavhaarik kism kii samasyaayein he
 Some mps also say that now everyone is adopting a wait and see situation
 apni sthiti haashie par jaataa dekh saal do saal baad saansad party ke bheetar ve zyaada mukhar ho sakate hai
 Overall, the 'tightness' that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is working with is creating a furor among mps
 or wo gubaar kabhi saarvajanik taur par bhi foot saktaa he
 After all, the politics of an MP will remain his area only then he will be able to stand with anyone! bharat ke gendbaaji coach bharat arun ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki team kaa tej gendbaaji akraman kabhi itnaa adhik majboot nahin laga or yuva khilaadi khalil ahamed ke shaamil hone se ise or majbootee mili he
 In a press conference on the eve of the fifth and final ODI against West Indies on Thursday, Arun said, 'we have a very good fast bowling quartet, and the bench strength is also very strong
 ’westeindies ke khilaaf maujuuda siries main jasprit bumraah, umesh yadav, bhubaneshwar kumaar or khalil ko tej gendbaaji vibhaag main jimmedaari saunpi gai he
 Arun strongly praised Khalil
 unhone kaha, ‘khalil kaaphi romaanchak daavedaar najar aata he
 He has the skills to sharpen and perform well in international cricket
 vah kaaphi romaanchak khilaadi he
 'khalil took three wickets for 13 runs in the fourth ODI against Mumbai against the West Indies, due to which the visiting team, chasing the target of 378 runs, collapsed for 153 runs
 bina kisi khilaadi kaa naam liye arun ne kaha ki tej gendbaaji main bench strength ke kaaran team prabandhan ke liye gendbaajon ko rotate karnaa or unke kaam ke boj kaa prabandhan kar paanaa aasaan ho gaya he
 Khalil Ahmed had done this action, ICC gave the demerit point bowling coach also defended Mahendra Singh Dhoni, a victim of criticism, saying that he is a great player of Indian cricket and will be able to perform well
 arun ne kaha, ‘vah bhartiya cricket ke diggaj khilaadiyon main se ek hai
 His strike ability can be seen by all
 unhone pehle bhi kai baar aisa kiya he

 There has been a big revelation after the arrest of Govardhan Singh, a former military man who was a traitor to the country in Pokaran, Rajasthan
 poochtacha main pataa chalaa ki paak khufia agency kaise hindustaniyon ko paise dekar apana bhediya bana rahi he
 Pakistan's spy in Pokhran, the agent of Pakistani intelligence agencies, Govardhan Singh Guddi was once a soldier in the Indian army
 pension lene ke baad vah gaanv kaa patawaari ban gaya
 But now he will be called a traitor
 govardhan ne sena main seva dene ke garv or apni deshbhakti ko hi mitti main mila diya
 For two years he had been spying in Pokaran for ISI
 govardhan bhartiya sena kii jaruri jaankariyaan iesai ko muhaiyaa karaata tha or badale main use moti rakam milti thi
 The use of social app to send information is very important for the army in Pokaran area of rajasthan
 isi ilaake main rahakar govardhan iesai ke liye kaam kar rahaa tha
 Aaj Tak has received information from Army and ATS sources that Govardhan used to send confidential information across the border through the Voice of Internet Protocol (voip)
 is system ko koi agency pakad nahin paati
 At the same time, through the whatsapp and Skype, the army's distinction was also spread to Pakistan
 govardhan ne kabool kiya ki vah iesai ke liye kaam kar rahaa tha
 Money was received through hawala If the link of money coming from Pakistan through hawala is not revealed, then the raw letter of Pak Agent Govardhan Singh could not be opened
 uttar pradesh aties ko input mila tha ki pakistan se hawala ke jariye upi ke ek shaks ke paas hawala ke jariye paise pahunch rahe hai
 That money was deposited in Govardhan's account in Rajasthan from UP
 uske khate main har maheene tees hajaar rupee jamaa kiye jate the
 Similarly, in Pakistan, the masters of Pak spies used to send money through hawala
 jutani thi sainya abhyaas kii jaankareepakistan kaa jasoos govardhan singh chandhan ke us sainik abhyaas kii jaankaree jutaney kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha, jo jald hi hone vaala he

 Two spies, two Missiongobardhan Singh Guddi and Birbal Khan

 Politician MP Amar Singh has once again connected the Samajwadi Party
 mangalvaar ko ve rajdhani main janeshwar mishra park ke udghaatan samaaroh main shaamil hue
 He appeared with Mulayam Singh Yadav on some stage four years later
 is nae raajnneetik ghatnakram ko rajyasabha chunaav se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 However, due to the absence of Azam Khan on this platform, all kinds of speculations have been started in political corridors
 sutron ke mutabik ajam ek manch par mulaayam or amar ke dikhne se naaraaz hai
 It is believed that mulayam-amar's friendship can be strengthened and the SP can send Amar Singh back to the Rajya Sabha
 unka kaarykaal 25 november ko khatm ho rahaa he
 At one time, Amar Singh was considered close and trusted to SP chief Mulayam Singh
 party or sarkaar ke str se hone vaale faislon main unki ahm bhoomika hoti thi
 In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the SP had preferred Amar Singh at the cost of Azam Khan
 ajam nahin chaahate the ki amar singh kii najdiki jayaprada ko rampur se loksabhaa kaa tikat mili
 Azam left the SP on this
 ajam ke virodh ke baavjood jayaprada sapa pratyaashee ke rup main chunaav ladiin or jiti bheen
 Later, relations with the SP leadership of Amar Singh started getting bitter
 yah rishton ke algaav tak pahunch gai
 In the 2012 Legislative Assembly elections, Amar Singh created his own party and fielded candidates and targeted the SP fiercely
 loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main ve rashtriya lokdal pratyaashee ke rup main fatehpur sikri va jayaprada bijanour se ladiin
 But both of them could not escape their bail
 ab raajnneetik halaat badale hue hai
 Amar Singh's Rajya Sabha membership is ending on 25 November
 unhen koi aisa raajnneetik thor nahin mila jahaan se phir rajyasabha main pahunchaa ja sake
 In such a situation, he does not see any place other than SP for re-entry in Rajya Sabha
 bataaya jaataa he ki amar singh ne mulaayam se dilli main taar jode or sapa ke najadik aane ke sanket die
 After being eliminated in the Modi wave, the SP has also given positive signals for her to restore the relationship
 isaki shuruyaat amar singh ko janeshwar mishra park ke udghaatan samaaroh main shaamil hone kaa nimantran dene se hui
 They have decided to attend the ceremony, accepting the invitation
 amar singh ne khud ko mulaayamavaadi kahkar sapa se puraani talkhi bhuulakar nai shuruyaat kaa sandesh de diya he

 It is said that if this report is implemented then the fate of the farmers will change

 tabhi haal main unhone kaha ki unki koshish agle 10 varshon main bihar ko vikaas ke alag-alag maanakon main desh ke 10 viksit rajyon kii shrenee main laana he
 They believe that it is necessary that more and more youth join politics
 pike partiyon ko sirf jitaane or haraane kii ranneeti nahin banaate
 They also draw out how to make the party full of resources so that its politics is connected to public relations
 pike shaayad pehle aise netaa honge jo bebaaki se kehete hai ki "jediu kii koshish he do saal main ek lakh aise yuvaaon ko sadsy banaaya jaae jinaki prishthbhumi raajnneetik nahin rahi ho
 In future, the party will also work to push such people forward
 " jahaan partiyaan is par jor detii hai kaaryakarta raajnneetik lihaaj se prashikshit hon to ground par unase madad lene main sahuuliyat hogi, to pike maanate hai ki kaaryakarta raajnneetik paath se jitne anbhigya honge, ve samaaj ke liye utane hi mufeed honge
 Heavy development on Ram Mandir Kishore says that Ram Mandir was not an issue when he was associated with BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and even then BJP won the election with an overwhelming majority
 pike ke mutabik vikaas ke mudde par bhi chunaav jite ja sakate hai
 His party may have an alliance with BJP in Bihar, but he clearly believes that BJP and JDU are two different parties
 kai muddon par donon partiyon kii soch alag he, to kai muddon par soch ek bhi he
 Both parties have their own principles, on which both of them follow
 siyaasi maharath main pichde pike0?jediu kii haal kii kuch ghatnaayen gavaah hai ki prashanth kishor bade ranneetikaar ho sakate hai lekin dharaatal par raajnneetik paripakvata laane main unhen abhi or vakt gujaarna he
 The political movements within his party within a few months show that PK can easily make big electoral strategy but the path of politics is not so easy for him
 tabhi haal main aae unke bayanon ke baad pike party main 'akelaa' padate najar aa rahe hai
 Experts say that ever since the entry of PK into JDU, many party leaders are said to be angry
 andarkhaane ye bhi khabar he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kii 3 march ko patna ke gandhi maidan main hui 'sankalp raily' ke manch par party netaaon kii nakhushi ke kaaran pike ko jagah nahin di gai thi
 pk's proximity to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is well known
 kuch isi kaaran jediu main jab unhen upaadhyaksh banaaya gaya to puraane netaaon ne tatkaal nakhushi jaahir nahin kii lekin netaa ab unke virodh main mukhar ho rahe hai
 Party vice-president PK had said a few days ago that 'the JDU should have gone to the NDA and taken a new mandate after being separated from the rjd-led grand alliance'
 unke is bayaan ke baad to jediu ke kai netaa asahaj ho gaye
 The protesting leaders said in suppressed language that such a statement given by the vice president of any party against the big decision taken for the party can never be accepted by a dedicated leader and activist
 unka ek or bayaan unheen kii party ke netaa nahin pachaa paae jisamen kaha tha ki unhone desh main pradhanmantri or mukhyamantri banaae hai, ab vah yuvaaon ko bhi saansad, vidhayak banaaenge
 After this statement many leaders of the party came out against him
 prashanth kishor kii paariwarik prishthbhumiprashanth kishor 1977 main bihar ke baxur jile main paidaa hue
 His father's name was Dr
 shrikant pandey he jo peshey se doctor hai
 pk's father was a medical superintendent in Buxar
 maa kaa naam indira pandey he jo gruhani hai
 Prashant Kishore's early education was in Bihar
 baad main unhone hyderabad se ejineering kii degree lee
 After this, he joined UNICEF and got involved in branding from here
 saal 2014 main narendra modi or bijepi kii prachand jeet ke peeche prashanth kishor kii ranneeti ko kaaran mana jaataa he
 'chai Pe Charcha' and '3D Narendra Modi' were two such campaigns which are considered to be the major basis of bjp's victory
 haalanki baad main bijepi se unki dooriyaan bad gayi or ve isse alag ho gaye
 Now reports are coming that despite the JDU becoming pk's relation, their distance from BJP remains the same
 congress netashashi tharurain dinon phir apane twit ko lekar charchaa main hai
 The reason for the discussion is an extremely long and complex English word used in tweet, due to which there is a tremendous stir in social media
 khaas baat yah he ki, tharur ke twit ke agle hi din navaratri main maa durga kii stuti se judapiemmodi kaa twit aayaa
 The word Sanskritka used in his tweet also seems to outweigh the English word of Tharoor
 shashi tharur apni clisht angreji ke liye vikhyath hai or twitaraati jagat main unke kathin shabdon ke istemaal par bharpoor maje liye jate hai
 Recently, he tweeted a lot for the promotion of his upcoming book 'the Paradoxical President'
 aise hi apane ek twit main tharur ne floccinaucinihilipilification (fluoxinocinihilipeliphication) shabd kaa istemaal kiya
 Some social media users even started mocking Shashi Tharoor about this word
 yugers ne poocha- kya yah kitaab kharidne par dictionari muft main milegi? darasal, shashi tharur ne likhaa tha, 'meri nai kitaab, da paradoxical prime ministar he jo 'fluoxinocinihilipeliphication' par 400 pannon kii mehnat ke alaava bhi kuch he
 My new book, THE PARADOXICAL PRIME MINISTER, is more than just a 400-page exercise in floccinaucinihilipilification
 Pre-order it to find out why!https: / / t
 co / yhuch2gzdm — Shashi Tharoor (@shashitharoor) October 10, 2018 This word means the habit of criticizing anything, whether it is wrong or right
 vaise, yah koi pehla mauka nahin he, jab tharur ne soshal media main kisi baari-bharkam shabd kaa istemaal kiya ho or log iske arth evam uccharan ko lekar bahes karne lage hon
 Earlier he used the term Hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia in a tweet
 karpadmabhyamakshmalakmandalu shabd kaa istemaldusri taraf, piemmodinvaratri kii shubhakamana dene ke liye har din sanskrit main koi na koi twit kar rahe hai
 The PM used the word 'karpadmabhyamakshmalkamandalu' in one such verse, people were upset to know its meaning
 piem ne 11 oktober ko ek twit main sanskrit ke is shloke ko likhaa-dadhana karpadmabhyamakshmalakmandalu
 Goddess Prasidatu Mayi Brahmacharinanyanuttama॥ This verse means - you wear a garland (right) and kamandal (left) in your karkamalas

 The state government had said on Sunday that 40 lakh postpaid mobile consumers would benefit from this move of the government

 The challenge of submitting an internet bill without the internet is that people in the Kashmir Valley have not been able to submit their bills for the last 2 months
 in mushkil halaat main bhi telecom companiyon ne graahakon ko koi raahat nahin di he
 The companies have neither waived the rentals for the months of August and September and have not given any other facility to the customers
 isse pehle jammu-kashmir ke pradhan sachiv rohit kansal ne kaha tha ki somvaar dopaher 12 baje se sabhi postped mobile sevaayen shuru ho jaaengi
 But the people of Kashmir claim something else
 india today ke sutron ne srinagar main maujuud kuch logon se baat kii
 They say that despite the introduction of phone services, they are unable to talk to their relatives and friends in other parts of Kashmir
 dakshin kashmir gramin ilaake main rahane vaale kashmir ne kaha, "richarge kii suvidha nahin he, bill kaa bhugtan kaise karen, hamaara phone ded he, hamen lagata he ki bill na dene kii vajah se phone companiyon ne hamaara conection kaat diya he
 "august-september is being paid," said another person on condition of anonymity, "it happens every time, 2010, 2012, 2016 and now we have seen that, it never happens that telecom companies network Forgive the monthly rentals at the time of the crackdown, as soon as the internet starts we have to make a big payment to the companies
 "internet shuru hue bina guzaara nahinis shaks ne kaha ki uske jaise logon ko samaj main nahin aa rahaa he ki is halaat se kaise nipten
 It said that until the internet services are not fully operational, our problem is not going to ease
 is yuvak ne kaha ki agar sarkaar internet puri tarah se behaal nahin karnaa chaahati he to din main kuch ghante internet chaalu karnaa chahie, jisase ham jaruri kaam kar saken
 "kashmiri student Basim expressed anger that it is shameful that we are having to spend days when we are not able to talk to our friends and relatives, if the government thinks that they will win the hearts of Kashmiris in this way
 The government is in a tizzy
 "srinagar main 5 agast se internet sevaayen thap he

 In Delhi, miscreants and thieves are getting stronger
 tabhi to wo kabhi dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal kii gaadi uthaa le jate hai to kabhi police chaowkee ke paas main hi maujuud sho room main lut ko anjaam dete hai
 In particular, cases of theft are coming to light in West Delhi
 dilli ke is ilaake main chori, snatching or lut kii ghatnaayen dhire-dhire aam hoti ja rahi hai
 The case of a large theft in the showroom is in Khyala area of west Delhi, where thieves committed the crime in an electronic showroom
 yah maamla shanivaar kaa he, jisamen chor lakhon kaa saamaan le ude hai
 Among the cases of theft in Kichoridilli near the police post, most of them are done around the police post itself
 aise main yah andaja lagaana mushkil nahin he ki choron main police prashasan kaa koi khauf nahin he
 This electronic showroom in Khyala area is also just 200 meters away from the police post, in which the police committed the theft incident
 le ude sisitivi kaa diviarelectronic shop main lakhon kii chori karne ke baad shaatir choron ne shop main lage sisitivi camere ke diviar ko bhi apane saath hi rakh liya
 But all the incidents of theft were captured in CCTV installed in a nearby shop
 sefti alarm ne bachaai dukansisitivi footage main yah spasht dikh rahaa he ki ek car dukaan ke paas aakar rukati he or chor utarate hai
 Break the shutter of the shop one by one and keep the goods in the car
 shaayad sefti alarm ke bajane se ve bhaag kar chori kaa saamaan rakh rahe the
 The theft was detected only after the safety alarm in the shop rang
 agar showrooms main sefti alarm nahin hota to chor or bhi badi chori kar sakate the
 People not on police investigation After the Bharosais incident, the police assured the investigation and said that the thieves would be caught soon
 lekin chori kii ye vaardaat thane se mahaj 200 meter duuri par hone ke kaaran sthaneey logon ko police kii kaarywahi par bharosa nahin ho rahaa he
 Locals allege that such incidents of theft have happened in the past, but the police have never shown strictness on such incidents and thieves are being encouraged
 mobile sho room menchoripulice ab har baar kii tarah is maamle main bhi shikaayat darj kar jaanch kii baat kah rahi he
 Whereas in Mayapuri area a week ago, thieves committed the theft incident of millions in a mobile showroom near the police beat box
 gujarat main ek baar phir se bijepi ne jeet kaa paracham laharaaya he, bijepi rajya main lagaataar chhathi baar sarkaar bana rahi he, or modi ke netritv main apana karishma bhi dikhaa rahi he
 Even after 22 years, if the BJP has managed to hold power in Gujarat, it is only and only because of Modi
 bijepi ke liye gujarat kii raah aasaan nahin thi
 Especially when the party is ruling in the center and elections are held in its pm's home state
 jis tarah se notebandi-jiesti ko lekar gujarat main maahaul bana usase bijepi ke liye satta virdohi lahar kii ashankaayen prabal ho rahi thim
 On the other hand, because of the Patel agitation, the situation was slipping from the hands of the BJP, then strengthening the hand of the Congress, not only the anti-incumbency or the Patidar reservation movement was becoming a challenge, but also as the Dalit and OBC youth leaders The rise of Jignesh and Alpesh Thakor also started creating an atmosphere against the BJP
 bijepi ke liye andruni bada sawaal ye bhi tha ki gujarat main 15 saal main pehali baar narendra modi mukhyamantri ummidavaar bhi nahin the
 Because of all these equations, the Congress was looking for a chance to return to power after 22 years
 lekin parde ke peeche kii kahani congress samajhnaa nahin chaahati thi or apane banaae maahaul main use bijepi kii haar dikhaai de rahi thi
 But if anyone has learned to read the mind of the voter of Gujarat in the true sense, then it is PM Modi, yes Modi has put his full strength to win Gujarat
 gujarat ke kuccha ilaake se modi ne apana mishan gujarat shuru kiya, or congress ko doklam se lekar pakistan tak gheraa, modi ne doklam mudde par rahul gandhi ko gherte hae kaha ki jab bhartiya sena doklam main china kii sena ke saath aankh se aankh milakar baat kar rahi thi, tab ye chini rajdoot ke saath gale mil rahe the
 Modi also pulled Hafiz Saeed's release in the Gujarat election
 modi ne kaha ki pakistan main jab most wanted aatanki hafiz said ko choda gaya, tab congress vaale tali baja rahe the
 For Gujarat, Modi pulled every issue in his campaign, from the 26 / 11 attacks, to the terrorist attack in Uri
 modi ne yahaan tak kah diya ki congress ne mahagujarat andolan ke dauraan kai yuvaonko maar diya
 When there was an earthquake in Kutch in 2001, our government worked very fast here
 Congress has always looked at Gujarat with hatred
 modi ne kaha meri training kuccha main hui thi, kuccha ke logon ne mujhe sikhaaya he
 Modi said in his campaign that Gujarat is my mother, there was never any taint on me, but the Congress is coming to Gujarat and accusing me, calling me good and bad
 gujarat kii janata kabhi congress ko maaf nahin karegi
 People of Gujarat will not forgive the attack here
 modi sarkaar gujarat main notebandi or jiesti par ghirti dikhaai di to modi ne yahaan bhi imotional card khel diya
 Modi also surrounded the Congress on the fight for dynasty and developmentism
 modi ne gujarat ke saamne voton ke jholii failaai to, janata ne bhi niraash nahin kiya, kehete hai naa ki puraane rishte zarurat padane par kaam aate hai, gujarat ke votaron ne bhi modi ko niraash nahin kiya or 22 saal puraane rishte ko zarurat ke vakt shiddat se nibhaayaa
 On the disrespect of the Congress, PM Modi's OBC card was also a gift from the Congress, which no veteran politician would let go, and as soon as Mani Shankar called Prime Minister Modi
 unhone fouran gher liya, phir to congress parahamala bolte hue modine kaha ki congress mughaliya sultanate kii nishaani he
 Modi said that Iyer's statement is not an insult to him but to Gujarat
 bastar main logon ke liye pradhanmantri kaa swatchta abhiyaan musiibat ban gaya he
 There are 500 houses in the village, where pits were dug to build toilets, but toilets could not be built
 ek saal se gaanv ke log sarkari daftaron kaa chakkar kaat rahe hai, lekin unki museebataan jas kii tas hai
 Many accidents have also occurred due to these pits
 kahin bachche girane kii ghatnaayen saamne ain, to kahin gaddhon main girane se maweshiyon kii maut ho rahi he
 The villagers are worried that if these pits are not filled before the rain, then a big accident can happen
 500 gharon main shauchalayabastar kii darabha ghati ke darjanon gaanv main pradhanmantri swatchta abhiyaan kaa jor-shor se prachaar prasar hua
 Officers gave the message of cleanliness and pits were dug for toilets in every household
 akele lendra gaanv main lagbhag 500 gharon main gadde khode gaye
 a pit was dug for a toilet in the house of farmer Ganga Ram of the same village
 gadde main uski bhens gir gai
 The pit was very deep, due to which the buffalo got trapped in it
 gaanvvaalon kii tamaam koshishon ke baavjood bhens ko nahin bachaaya ja sakaa
 People are upset for a year, not only Ganga Ram, but about 500 families living in this village are in bad condition
 tamaam logon ke yahaan panchayat vibhaag ne shauchalay nirmaan ke naam par bhadda majaak kiya he
 But the case is not limited to pits
 naa to yahaan shauchalay nirmaan ke liye graminon ko sweekrut rakam di gai, or naa hi nirmaan kii javaabadari panchayat vibhaag ne lee
 More than a year passed
 lekin is gaanv ke kisi bhi ghar main naa to shauchalay kaa nirmaan hua or naa hi gaddhon ko bharne ke liye kisi ne koi ruchi dikhaai
 In such a situation, these pits are proving fatal
 kabhi inamen gir kaa bachche ghayal ho rahe he
 So sometimes cattle are dying
 is gaanv ke tamaam logon ne gadde bharne kii ijaajat maangi he
 But the Panchayat Department also did not allow it
 chunki sarkari nirdesh or sarkari bhugtan ke jariai in gaddhon ko khoda gaya he
 Therefore, to avoid the crime of interference in government work, the villagers are unable to dare to fill these pits
 logon ne kii harjane kii mangailake ke logon ne lagaataar saal bhar tak adhikariyon ko maamle kii shikaayat kii
 But no solution was found
 ab graminon ne colector se shikaayat kar maweshiyon kii hui maut kaa harjaana maanga he
 Not only this, the people have also repeated the demand of filling the pits, because the rain will fill the water in these pits
 aise main ye gadde khatarnaak sabit honge
 However, the Panchayat Department is talking about taking action soon

 Former Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan called demonetisation and GST as two major bottlenecks in the country's economic growth that affected the pace of growth last year
 unhone is baat par jor diya ki saat pratishat kii maujuuda vikaas dar desh kii jaruraton ke hisaab se kaaphi nahin he
 Rajan said at the University of California at Berkeley on Friday that India's economic growth during the four years between 2012 and 2016 was quite fast before demonetisation and GST were affected by these two issues
 bharat ke bhavishya par yojit duusare bhattacharya vyaakhyaan main rajan ne kaha, "notebandi or jiesti ke do lagaataar jhatkon ne desh kii aarthik vruddhi par gambhir asar daalaa
 The country's growth rate started falling at a time when the global economic growth rate was catching pace
 "1
 Incentive is not enough
 Growth of 7 percent said that the economic growth rate of seven percent for 25 years is very strong growth but in some ways it has become the new normal rate of growth for India which was earlier three and a half percent
 unhone kaha, "sach yah he ki jis tarah ke log lebar market se jud rahe hai unke liye saat pratishat paryaapt nahin he or hamen adhik rojgaar paidaa karne kii jarurat he
 We cannot be satisfied at this stage
 "2
 According to Raghuram Rajan, the growth rate of 7 percent should be for 15 years, if we grow at less than seven percent then there are definitely some mistakes
 unhone kaha ki bharat ko is aadhaar par kam se kam agle 10-15 saal tak vruddhi kerani hogi
 3
 gahare the notebandi-jiesti ke attackepurv arabiai governor ne vaishvik vruddhi ke prati bharat ke samvedansheel hone kii baat sweekaar karte hue kaha ki bharat ab kaaphi khuli arthvyavastha he
 If the world develops, India also develops
 unhone kaha, "2017 main yah hua ki duniya main growth rate main speed pakadaney ke baad bhi bharat kii raftaar sust padi
 This suggests that these tremors (demonetisation and GST) were indeed deep shocks
 
 
 in jhatkon ke kaaran hamen thithakna padaa
 "the recession came from Rajan's policies, NITI Aayog boils down on Raghuram
" kachche tel kii keemton kaa growth story par asarrajan ne phir se raftaar pakad rahi bhartiya arthvyavastha ke samaksh kachche tel kii badhati keemton kii chunauti ke babat urja jaruraton kii purti ke liye tel aayaat par desh kii nirbharta kaa zikr kiya
 The former governor said that the situation will be a bit difficult for the domestic economy due to rising crude oil prices, even if the country is recovering from the restrictions of demonetisation and GST
 5
 In the discussion, Raghuram Rajan also gave his opinion about NPA
 unhone kaha ki aisi sthiti ko saaf suthri bananaa hi behatar hoga
 Rajan said, it is important that bad things are dealt with so that the balance sheet is clean and banks can get back on track
 bharat ko bainkon ko saaf karne main lanbaa vakt laga he iskaa aanshik kaaran he ki pranali ke paas bure rin se nipatane ke saadhan nahin the
 Rajan said that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code could not alone be able to keep banks' accounts clean
 unhone kaha ki yah is tarah kii safai kii badi yojana kaa ek tatv bhar he
 There is a need to adopt a multi-layered approach to deal with the challenge of npas in the country
 6
 10 lakh jobs needed every month Raghuram Rajan said that India needs to create 10 lakh jobs every month for new people joining the labor force
 rajan ne kaha ki desh ke saamne abhi teen dikkatein hai
 The first problem is the bumpy infrastructure
 unhone kaha ki nirmaan vah udyog he jo arthvyavastha ko shuruaati charan main chalaata he
 After that growth is created by infrastructure
 unhone kaha ki doosraa alpakaalik lakshya bijli kshetra kii sthiti ko behatar bananaa ho saktaa he
 It should be ensured that the electricity generated annually reaches those who need it
 raghuram rajan bole- PMO ko di thi hai profile NPA difolters kii list7
 Centralization of power is a major problem
 Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan believes that excessive centralization of power is one of the major problems in political decision making in India
 is sambandh main unhone gujarat main haal hi main anaavaran kii gai sardaar patel kii murti 'stachu of unity' pariyojna kaa zikr kiya
 He said that this project also required the approval of the Prime Minister's Office, Rajan said, "india cannot work from one center
 bharat tab kaam karata he jab kai log milakar boj uthaa rahe hon
 Whereas the central government in India today has powers highly centralized
 "raghuram rajan ne udhaaharan bataaya, "bahut saare nirnay ke liye pradhanmantri karyaalay kii sahmati leni hoti he
 No one wants to take a decision until permission is obtained from the Prime Minister's Office
 iskaa arth yah he ki pradhanmantri yadi pratidin 18 ghante bhi kaam karen, unke paas itnaa hi samay he
 However, he is a hardworking prime minister
 "8
 Needful of will power like 'statue of Unity', he said that we have completed this huge statue of Sardar Patel in time
 yah dikhaata he ki jab chaah hoti he to raah bhi he
 But can we show this kind of desire for other things also? His statement gave a loud laugh and applause in the auditorium
 9
 Apart from excessive centralization of public sector and bureaucratic reluctance, he described bureaucratic reluctance in India as a major problem
 raghuram rajan ne kaha ki jab se bharat main bhrashtachar ke ghotaale ujagar hone shuru hue, naukarshahi ne bade project se apane kadam peeche khinch liye
 He also said that India's public sector companies are reluctant to take initiative on big things
 ye ek badi samasya he

 He said that the data for the last two years shows that the scope of tax has increased, the economy has become more formal and for the fifth consecutive year India remains the fastest growing main economy
 jetali ne 'notebandi ke prabhaav' naam se daale gayi apane fasebuk blog main kaha, "jab tak hamaari sarkaar ke paanch saal puure honge tab tak desh main karadaataaon kaa dayera lagbhag doguna hone ke kareeb pahunch chukaa hoga
 "let me tell you that Rajan, born in 1963 in Bhopal, was the 23rd Governor of the Reserve Bank of India

 Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said at the Pune International Literature Festival on Saturday that India has now become a country where either you are on this side or there is no room for tolerance between that side and it
 unhone is raajnneetik 'dhruvikaran' ke liye “sattadhari dal” ke krityon or pasand ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 In a session titled "truly Yours", Shashi Tharoor, author of the book 'why i Am a Hindu', said that there is 'no Hindu way' though there is 'mine or their' Hindu way
 unhone kaha, 'yahaan meraa hindu najariya he
 There he has a view of Hinduism and everyone has his own Hinduist approach
 yahi jaadu he kyonki hindootv koi kathor tarika nahin bataata he
 'tharoor said,' i can worship Rama, i read Hanuman Chalisa, that's why i am a Hindu
 
 
 
 But suddenly if someone says that i do not do any of these and in spite of that i am a Hindu, then both of them are right, and have not understood it as BJP and Sangh Parivar
 'shashi tharur nekaha, 'main maanata hum ki meraa ek sach he or aap maanate hai ki aapke paas sach he
 
 
 i will respect my truth and please respect my truth

 Taking a dig at the BJP, Tharoor said that there has been polarization of politics in India and the acts and likes of the ruling party in particular are responsible for this

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The budget session of Parliament has ended but nothing much has been achieved in the name of productivity
 yah bajet satr 29 farvari se shuru hua tha or 6 april ko khatm ho gaya
 During this time a total of 29 sittings of Lok Sabha and 30 sittings of Rajya Sabha were held, but the second part of this session divided into two parts was completely an uproar
 bajet satr ke pehle bhaag main loksabhaa kii 7 baithkon kii utpaadakta 134 pratishat thi or rajyasabha kii 8 baithkon kii utpaadakta 96 pratishat rahi
 But in contrast the productivity of Lok Sabha in the second part was 4 percent while the productivity of Rajya Sabha was 8 percent
 puure satr ko milakar loksabhaa kii utpaadakta 23 pratishat or rajyasabha kii utpaadakta 28 pratishat rahi
 It is clear from the data that the work done in the first part, the uproar in the second part also affected his good record

 Cauvery Management Board AIADMK mps created a ruckus in both houses to demand the formation of Cauvery Management Board

 But due to uproar in the house, no issue could be discussed
 tamilnadu ke saansadon ne toatmahatya karne kii dhamkeetak de daali thi
 Explain that the Supreme Court in its judgment on 16 February had talked about the formation of the Cauvery Management Board in the state
 board ke gathan main ho rahi deree ke virodh main rajya main bhi lagaataar pradarshan ho rahe hai
 Right from the beginning of the PNB scam, Congress, TMC and other opposition parties wanted to discuss the issue under Rule 52 of the voting on the PNB scam
 lekin sarkaar isapar taiyaar nahin thi
 The government was agreeable to the discussion but under Rule 193, in which only debate can be held but voting cannot be done
 donon sadanon main is mudde par hangaamaa hota rahaa lekin bahes kisi bhi niyam ke tahat nahin ho saki

 Other opposition parties, including the Congress, accused the central government of being anti-dalit, while the government also made it clear in Parliament that it is committed to strengthening the law, not weak
 satr ke aakhri main 3-4 din is mudde par donon sadanon main joardaar hangaamaa dekhne ko mila
 On the order of the Supreme Court, there were several changes in the SC / ST Act
 centre sarkaar par aarope lag rahe hai ki usne adaalat main is maamle main majbootee se paksh nahin rakhaa
