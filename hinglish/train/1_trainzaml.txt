 On October 12, 28-year-old Gopal Mohan, the election in-charge of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in New Delhi, was surprised to hear Sheila Dixit's phone call in the morning
 lekin unhen is baat kaa ehsaas ho gaya ki dilli kii mukhyamantri 15 saal ke baad apana pad khone kii badhati sambhaavna se kis kadar baukhala gai hai
 Arvind Kejriwal, 45, aap's chief ministerial contender who challenged his throne, was sitting in the party's bustling office on Hanuman Road, taking a break from campaigning at that time
 gopal mohan ne apane blueberi kaa spikar chaalu kar diya to kejariwal sunne lage ki shila dikshit kis tarah rajdhani main lokapal kaa pad banane ke aap party ke chunavi vaade par aapatti jataa rahi thim
 His stubbornness was, "there is a better Lokayukta in Delhi than you are not doing right
" ’’ 28 saal ke aap kaaryakarta gopal mohan ne badi vinamrata se kaha ki maujuuda lokayukta ke paas koi adhikaar nahin he
 Kejriwal was quickly weary of this conversation and left for his next election meeting in Rithala (north-west)
 ek din baad kejariwal ne twit kiya, ‘‘shilajee ne nai dilli nirvachan kshetra main mere prachaar prabandhak gopal ko kal phone kiya tha
 She wanted Gopal to explain her about Lokpal
 par ab kyon? ab yaad ai?’’rajnatik satta ko dhata bataanaa araajaktaavaadi kejariwal kii puraani aadat he
 They are running such an incredible campaign that aims to push the Congress and the BJP into political bias
 ve bharat main raajnneeti kaa cheharaa badal dena chaahate hai
 Unlike the traditional means, their propaganda is dependent on the party's more than 7,000 loyal volunteers
 inamen chaatr, factory kaamgaar, apni naukariyon se chuttee lekar aae yuvak-yuvatiyaan, taxi driver or ritred sarkari karmchaaree shaamil hai
 They are going from house to house telling people why change has become inevitable rather than just important
 log unhanr udaartaa se paisa de rahe hai, haalanki mukhyadhara ke rajnatik dal chunaav main jo rakam kharch karte hai yah usase kaaphi kam he
 Around 50,000 subscribers contributed around Rs 11 crore from January to October 16
 jamaa kar liye hai
 Kejriwal pointed to aap's website and said, "we have made a pie-pie list of every contribution
" ’’ is website par daan dene waalon kii list turant apadet kar di jaati he
 This makes Kejriwal's resolve of transparency appear to be true and the charges of "suspected foreigners being blessed" are dismissed
 unke saathi or supreme court ke vakil prashanth bhushan kejariwal ko ‘‘sach bolne vaale ausat kad kaa insaan’’ kehete hai
 Kejriwal estimates that AAP will get 47 seats in the December 4 vote
 maujuuda vidhansabha main congress ke jabardast bahumat se bhi ye chaar siten zyada hai
 90 percent of AAP candidates are young and are entering politics for the first time
 inamen janakapuri se mithaiwala, chhatarpur kaa pahalwaan, gokulpuri se dharmik pratimaayein banane vaala shilpkaar, shakur basti se architect shaamil hai
 Each of these has been nominated by the local public
 kejariwal jor dekar kehete hai ki sabhi ummidavaaron ne likhakar halafanama diya he ki ve apane matadaataaon ke prati paardarshee or javabdeh rahenge
 Kejriwal is getting the smell of success
 sarojini nagar main nichle darje ke sarkari karmchaariyon, chaatro or chote dukandaaron kii badi hoti sabha main aam aadmi se netaa bane kejariwal ne vaada kiya, ‘‘4 disambar ko dilli main kuch asaadhaaran ghatane vaala he
 "A florist in Khan Market told him that eight out of every 10 of his customers are talking about voting for AAP
" kejariwal kehete hai, ‘‘yah sach he
 Get out on the road and ask the first 10 people you meet
 ’’ ho saktaa he ki unka yah aatmavishvaas apane mohare pitate dekh rahe netaaon ke badbolepan se kuch adhik ho
 Yogendra Yadav, a political scientist and prominent thinker of AAP, has been continuously surveying the changing mood of Delhi voters since February this year with the help of alumni of the Center for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS)
 unka kahana he ki nattejey hairat main daalane vaale hai
 When Team Kejriwal split from Anna Hazare and started Aam Aadmi Party on 26 November 2012, his journey seemed to be very long
 yadav ke anusaar aap party ne apane bhavishya ke liye bispi ke sangrakshak kanshiram ke is takiyakalam ko pathpradarshak mana, ‘‘pehla chunaav haarane ke liye
 To defeat the second election
 teesraa jeetne ke liye
 "but in early October, Cicero Associates of Delhi conducted a poll for AAP in which the vote share of the party was 32 percent, which is 3 percent more than the Congress
" yadav ke mutabik, farvari main aap party 14 pratishat vot share ke saath congress or bijepi se peeche bataai ja rahi thi, tab unka vot share 35-35 pratishat aanka gaya tha
 There has been tremendous change since
 unka kahana he, ‘‘yah sachai hamaare saamne aane lagi he ki dilli main agali sarkaar banane ke liye hamen bulaayaa jaae
 "they believe that bogus votes or votes lured by liquor and money are not included in the survey because it is not possible to get a" figure "
 aap ke surveykshan se thik ek maheenaa pehle india today-si voter desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan main aap ko congress or bijepi ke baad tisare number par rakhaa gaya tha
 Even then, Kejriwal was said to be the second most popular Chief Minister in this survey, which shows how much voters are interested in AAP convenor
 dhire-dhire khadi hoti is party main kejariwal shaayad akele varisht sadsy hai, jo is anupaat se hairaan nahin hai
 He predicts, "by the time the Delhi voter stands in a queue outside the polling booth on December 4, the trend towards you will increase to a decisive extent
 ’’ unhone chunaav ayog ke sakht ravaiye kii ore ishaara kiya ki kareeb 14 lakh bogus voter khaarij kiye ja chuke hai
 Similarly, the poorest people who are considered to be the most helpless in the face of greed for liquor and cash, have also become sensible this time in their view, "they are telling us that we will take from both of them, but will put the stamp on the broom
" ’’ kejariwal ko yakeen ho gaya he ki dilli kii tamaam jhuggi bastiyon main party ke lagaataar prachaar se log samaj gaye hai ki vot ke liye bantane vaala paisa asal main vah paisa he jise badi partiyon ne janata se hi lutaa he
 Kejriwal says, "the contest in these elections is between honesty and corruption
 dilli nagar nigam main 7 saal se bijepi kaa raaj he or 15 saal se congress dilli main sarkaar chalaa rahi he
 Both are very dishonest
 log yah sab dekh rahe hai or is baar unke paas eemaandaar vikalp he
 He based his election strategy on the basis of his own voluntary organization Parivartan founded in 1999 and the experiences of Anna Hazare's Jan Lokpal movement
 nukkad sabhaaon ke jariye matadaataaon ko joda ja rahaa he
 Manifesto meetings are taking place in every constituency, where voters are called to suggest how to improve administration in their area
 iske saath hi ghar-ghar jaakar logon se mulaakaat kii ja rahi he
 Kejriwal says, "people want answers to their questions
 aap unke or apane bich baad se ghire 12 foot oonche manch se aisa kisi tarah nahin kar sakate
 "in these street corner meetings, the first initiative came in the spectacle
 unke pratidwandvi khilli udaane lage
 But your most well-known person listens attentively to people
 isaki vajah se kejariwal un logon ko bhaane lage jo dilli kaa aglaa mukhyamantri chunenge
 On October 13, Kejriwal was listening attentively when enthusiastic residents in Ansari Nagar in the colony of low-paid government employees settled in government houses
 nai dilli main nagar nigam ke maujuuda karmchaaree ne bataaya ki makaan puraane hai, dekhbhaal nahin hoti or gir rahe hai
 An anxious mother said that the police should do more patrolling after dark
 ek yuvati chaahati thi ki colony main sisitivi camere lagen, taaki baahar se aane vaale shararti tatwon par lagaam lag sake
 These proposals were included in the aap's election manifesto for the New Delhi constituency
 party ne 70 vidhansabha kshetron main se prayek ke liye alag ghoshnaptr taiyaar kiye hai
 Kejriwal says, "these will reveal the problems of the whole of Delhi openly for the first time
" ’’rajya sarkaar banane ke liye apni party kii badhati sambhaavna ko dekhte hue kejariwal ne shashan kii niti banane ke liye janamat sangrah kaa apana vivaadit suzav chhod diya he, ‘‘janamat sangrah ke jariye rajya ko nahin chalaa sakate
 Actually, i want to make people's participation in administration mandatory
 yah janamat sangrah se bahut alag he
 "kejriwal is confident that the way you are going door-to-door contact, it will actually get a large number of votes
 ve maanate hai ki shila dikshit kii congress or vijay goyal ke netritv main behad banty hui bijepi badi reliyon or bade naamon kaa sahaara lekar bhi itane vot nahin juta paaengi
 Kejriwal says, "people go to big rallies for free food and entertainment from celebrities
 ’’agar in daavon main thodaa bhi dam hua to shila dikshit ke liye mushkil hone vaali he
 "party workers have met 24,000 of the 30,000 families in the New Delhi constituency," says Bibhav Kumar, 32, who left Kejriwal's media manager as a reporter at NDTV

 48-year-old Ashok Yadav worked in Mother Dairy
 unhone kuch paariwarik samasyaon kii vajah se prachaar choda tha
 Now he too is back at the AAP office at 41 Hanuman Road
 ve garv se kehete hai, ‘‘4 april, 2011 ko aam aadmi topi sabase pehle maine hi pahani thi
 "still wearing the cap of the common man, Yadav is helping those coming to office, especially those seeking membership
" unke peeche kii diwaar par barish main bhiige kejariwal kaa ek bada-sa binar laga he, jisamen ve gusse se dilli ke voter ko lalkaar rahe haih ‘‘ye desh ke liye tan, man or dhan nyochhavar karne kaa avasar he
 
 
 "kejriwal says," These people have not come because Arvind considers Kejriwal as the Messiah
 ye isliye aate hai, kyonki unhen pehali baar us desh ko saaf karne kaa mauka mila he, jisaki unhen chintaa he
 "but there is no doubt that this emerging party is dependent on this former Indian Revenue Service officer for success
" aam taur par aadhi baanh kii kameez, pant or pair se badi sandals pahane yah chota-sa maamuli aadmi aam taur par sadakon par kisi kii najar main nahin aata, lekin aaj kejariwal aap ke akele chehre ke rup main janata ke saamne hai
 On the criticism related to this, Kejriwal says that this perception is the creation of the media
 lekin yogendra yadav ko netaa ke taur par unhen pesh karne main kuch galat nahin lagata
 He says that Kejriwal's resemblance to the common man connects him to the public
 aap kii rajnatik ranneeti main har jagah apni upasthiti dikhaanaa ahm he or yah ranneeti mukhyadhara kii partiyon ke dhan or baahubal kaa safalataa se muqabla kar rahi he
 Kejriwal says that only one and only revolution can save India from the clutches of corruption spread in every corner of the government
 unke mutabik, ‘‘hamaari maujuuda rajnatik vyavastha main nek iraade vaale log bhi acchhee sarkaar nahin de sakate
 "the vision statement of AAP considers Swaraj or decentralization of political power as an essential part of all solutions, it is through this that people will get the right to insist on policies affecting their surrounding areas
" kejariwal ko yakeen he ki jamini str par logon ko adhikaar dene se vyapak str par aisa badlaav aayega, jisase ‘‘sarkaron kaa kairactor hi badal jayega
 "they are promising to give legal status to Swaraj within three months of forming the government in Delhi
" bharat main chunaav ko eendhan dene vaale bhrashtachar ke kuchakr ko todgaye kaa iraadaa jaahir karte hue kejariwal kehete hai, ‘‘ham jo badlaav laaenge usase vidhaayi shakti main bhrasht netaaon kii dilchaspee puri tarah khatm ho jaaegi
 "when in power, you will first pass the Jan Lokpal Bill for Delhi, which will be taken from the draft prepared in 2011 under the leadership of Anna
" aap kaa baaki agenda abhi tak khulkar saamne nahin aayaa he
 Yogendra Yadav is working on it
 unka kahana he ki, ‘‘videsh niti, rashtriya suraksha or aarthik soch jaise pramukh kshetron main 31 niti samitiyaan report taiyaar karne ke kareeb hai
 The policy document is drafted, which will be put up for public debate soon
 ’’kejariwal zyada khulkar kehete hai, ‘‘ham kisi vichaardhaara se nahin bandhe hai
 We will gladly seek solutions from both the left and right sides
 ’’ ve kaarobaar ke liye eemaandaar maahaul banane kii baat bhi karte hai, ‘‘daulat paidaa karne or rojgaar jutaney ke liye hamen kaarobaar ko badhaava dena hoga

 videsh niti ke sandarbh main aap sabhi deshon ke saath shanti ke sambandh chaahegi, lekin bharat ke samrik or aarthik hiton kii raksha jaruri he
 Kejriwal has retained the command of campaigning in Delhi, but Yadav and his colleagues in the aap's national executive are busy making plans for the future
 yadav ne kaha, ‘‘congress or bijepi ke vyaavhaarik vikalp kii jagah bad rahi he, lekin tisare vikalp ke liye uplabdh saadhan kam hote ja rahe hai
 He expressed his intention to seize the place
 party haryana, maharashtra, tamilnadu or karnataka sahit pramukh rajyon ke raste 2014 main sansad main jabardast upasthiti darj karaane ke raste talash rahi he
 Apart from its organizational structure in Delhi, the party has set up around 400 district-level units in the states

 He told, "I tell people that it is up to you to think what you will do if we lose the election
 ’’india today ne jab poocha ki agar haar hui to aap kya karoge, to kajriwal itani safagoi nahin dikhaa sake
 He admitted, "we don't have any plan B"
 agar logon ne hamen bahumat nahin diya to aap vipaksh main baithegi
 Forging alliances with the Congress or the BJP would be cheating our voters
 ’’teen saal pehle kejariwal ne elaan kiya tha ki ve aakhri dam tak ladate rahenge
 Breathing amid indiscriminate campaigning in Delhi, Kejriwal said on October 13 in his two-bedroom flat in Kaushambi, "the fight is still long

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke mahatvakankshi ‘‘mek in india’’ abhiyaan ko raksha kshetra se badi chunauti milane vaali he
 Modi wants companies from all over the world to come to India to make weapons and equipment for India and the Indian defense establishments are strong enough to be able to sell instead of buying modern technology from other countries
 par hakeekat yah he ki desh main raksha sambandhi upkaran or takanic banane vaali sheersh sarkari sanstha raksha anusandhan or vikaas sanghathan (diardio) ko hi apni ek-ek khoj or upkaran ko patent karaane main 10-10 saal tak lag ja rahe hai
 How could DRDO get an eye on the international defense market in case it could not get a patent on its discovery? India Today investigated each of the dozens of patent applications filed by DRDO about sensitive missile systems and found that five years Most of the applications submitted earlier have not even been considered
 ye argiyaan aisi mixilon se sambandhit thim, jinhen durgam, samudri ilaakon or vipareet paristhitiyon main safaltaapurvak daagna he
 Interestingly, the country's patent office does not favor these applications at all, but many countries have received patent certificates within two years from countries such as Russia, South Africa and Singapore
 videsh main paas or desh main latachemisile launture or robotics se jude nirmaan main awwal diardio kii pune prayogshaala research and deveopment stablishment (ejineering) ne 2007 main brahmos missile ke liye mobile missile launch system taiyaar kiya
 a petition was filed in 2009 to obtain separate patents related to it
 paanch saal main inamen se kisi bhi arji ko patent hasil nahin hua he
 Some have written that the application is to be tested, while the rest is written that the application is under testing
 isi dauraan 2010 main daayar isi tarah ke patent aavednon ko dakshin africa ne may 2012 main or singapore ne november 2012 main patent jari kar diya
 Now see: the mobile missile Autonomous Launcher being built only for brahmos missile is awaiting patent in India, while the Russian government has issued it
 is launture ko bharat or rus ke 35 vaigyanikon kii team ne teen saal kii mehnat ke baad taiyaar kiya tha
 This launcher is specially designed for the Navy
 khatre main mek in indindia today ne jin patent aavednon ko khangala unamem sabase purana aavedan 2006 kaa he
 a patent has not yet been issued for "electric Connector Mechanism"
 patent hasil na hone kaa sidhaa matlab he ki aapaki takanic kabhi bhi chori ho sakati he or uskaa bade paimaane par durupyog kaa andeshaa rahata he
 When our technology can be patented from other countries, why is it taking so long in our country? The pain of a DRDO scientist who is waiting for his six patents, "the world of technology changes very fast, so after eight-ten years, our efforts will be lost
" ’’ is mudde par diardio khulkar kuch bolne ko taiyaar hi nahin
 Ravi Kumar Gupta, information director and senior scientist of the organization, argues that "patents don't matter much
" hamaari senaaon ko jin upkarnon or praudyogiki kaa istemaal karnaa he, use istemaal kar sakati he
 The main purpose of the patent is that no one else can get your technology and give you royalty if you do
 ’’‘‘mek in india’’ kii yaad dilaane par ve kehete hai, ‘‘diardio praudyogiki niryaat ko lekar abhi tak to bahut aakraamak nahin rahaa he lekin mek in india jaisi pariyojnaon main vibhinn hissedaaron kii bhagidaari hogi, aise main behad dhimi patent prakriya chunauti pesh kar sakati he
 Patents will be necessary as soon as the defense market opens
 pehle bhi uthaaya he khamiajis saal 5 agast ko us vakt ke raksha mantri arun jetali ne bharat kii 10 pramukh raksha pariyojnaon main deree kii jo vajahen rajyasabha main ginaayin unamem swadeshi takanic hasil hone main lagane vaale lambey vakt ko bhi ek ahm kaaran mana
 In his statement, he said that one of the reasons for increasing the deadline of Light Combat Aircraft Phase 2 from December 2008 to March 2015 was that the big countries refused to give the technology
 ‘‘jameen se hawa main maar karne vaali lambii duuri kii missile’’ kii samay seemaa may 2011 se badhaakar disambar 2015 karne kii ek vajah he ki bahut-si takneekein pehali baar viksit kii gayi
 "the reason for the delay of four years in Naval Light Combat Vehicle Phase Wild was the need for more modern technology than anticipated
 yah bayaan is taraf saaf ishaara karata he ki bharat ke paas sahi samay par sahi takanic maujuud nahin thi or is kshetra main tej kaam karne kii jarurat he
 According to Gupta, DRDO currently has more than 500 patent applications pending
 patent daftar main chah saal kaa backlogpatent vibhaag ke mumbai daftar ke ek varisht adhikari aagaah karte hai, ‘‘agar kisi arji se sambandhit shodhpatr ko prakashit hone main yaa uski jaanch shuru hone main hi kai saal lag jate hai or is bich koi doosraa paksh us takanic ko bana letaa he, to patent duusare paksh ke khate main bhi ja saktaa he
 "in the words of this officer," the Patent Department has a pending list of at least six years and DRDO or any other institution has no preference in it
 ’’agar ek dashak baad patent mil bhi jaae or phir maamla adaalat main chalaa jaae to bhagwaan hi maalik, kyonki bharat main aavedan karne kii taarikh se agle 20 saal ke liye hi patent vaid hota he
 1 at this time in the Patent Office
 5 lakh argiyaan lambit hai
 To speed up the functioning of the Patent Department, the previous government had proposed to recruit 254 officers and employees here
 nai sarkaar ne aate hi is prastaav ko aage badhaayaa
 For two months now, this proposal has been pending for approval by the Finance Ministry
 haalanki ye bhartiyon hone kaa matlab yah nahin ki raturaat patent vibhaag ke kaam main chakke lag jaaenge

 ' dravid ne kaha, 'unhen milakar kaam karnaa chahie
 You do not want the police to always be sitting in your room

 passport vivaad ko lekar kai dinon se trobers ke gusse kaa shikaar ho raheen videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ko ab kendriya mantriyon ko samarthan mil rahaa he
 After Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Nitin Gadkari has also raised his voice in support of Sushma
 lekin isse itar is maamle main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh sushamaa se naaraaz dikh rahaa he
 Sangh not agreeing with the stand of the Ministry of External Affairs! According to sources, a large section of the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh do not agree with the stand of the Ministry of External Affairs in the passport dispute
 sangh ke sutron kaa maananaa he ki videsh mantralay ab tak is vivaad ke sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin de paaya he
 Sources in the union say that the foreign ministry should have revoked the passport of Tanvi Seth and her husband Anas following reports from police and LIU
 saath hi sangh kaa ye bhi maananaa he ki jab ye baat saamne aa gai ki tanvi seth ek saal se lakhanu ke pate par nahin rah rahi thi to phir passport kaise jari hua or adhikari vikaas mishra kaa transfar abhi tak waapas kyon nahin liya gaya?sangh padaadhikari ne kiye kai twitsangh kii naaraazgi kaa pataa sangh ke dilli praant prachaar pramukh rajeev tuli ke 21 june ko kiye twit se saaf ho jaataa he
 In this tweet, he wrote, questioning the attitude of the Ministry of External Affairs, Kisushma is not older than Swaraj Kannoon - Vikas Mishra should get justice
 victim card or upar tak pahunch isse itar bhi duniya he

 At the same time, the biggest reason for the bjp's silence is that those who are questioning Sushma on the passport dispute are supporters of the party's ideology
 ve party or sangh ke saath sarkaar se jude muddon ko soshal media par jor-shor se uthaate rahe hai
 In such a situation, the party believes that opposing them would not be politically appropriate
 lekin mangalvaar ko sushamaa swaraj kii troling par minakshi lekhi ne kaha, soshal media par bahut abhadra vyavhaar ho rahaa he
 Sushma ji herself is going to give protection to everyone
 unako protection dene kii jarurat nahin he
 Let us tell you that Sushma Swaraj has been on the target of trollers for the past several days
 twitor par unke khilaaf kai tarah ke twit kiye ja rahe hai, inamen se kai twit ko sushamaa ne like bhi kiya
 He also sought public opinion on these tweets by running a poll

 There has been a decline of 5 percent
 yah wo sector hai jahaan sangathit or asganthit rojgaar adhik hota he
 If it has been declining for a year and a half, then you can understand why raids on news channels and news of national syllabus have increased
 news channelon kii recording nikaal kar dekhie, bharat kii arthvyavastha main giravat kii aahat tak sunai nahin degi
 Debates are being made on a wide range of issues like fake mava sweets are made during Diwali, in the same way, fake issues are being debated on the channels

 ' The BJP, which is busy preparing for next year's assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, is now going to organize a lotus fair to woo voters
 ye meley upi ke hathras, pilibhit, bijanour, rampur, lakhimpur khiri, hardoi, kaushambi or mirzapur sahit 20 jilon main lagaae jaaenge

 This time in the Gujarat elections, the Congress was seen to compete with the BJP, but in this battle, the BJP is seen winning once again
 agsit pole to kam se kam yahi kar rahe hai
 Even after increasing the vote share of the Congress, it may lose its share again
 isse pehle kai baar agsit pole kai baar galat bhi sabit hue hai
 In such a situation, the speculation is still going on, whose decision will be on December 18 only
 lekin ek baar yah jaan lenaa jaruri he ki pichley chunaavon main agsit pole asal nateezon ke kitne kareeb rahe hai
 Exit poll failed in 2004, when the slogan of India Shining was raised in the shadow of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government in 2004, at that time, the exit poll had told that Vajpayee would again hold power
 lekin hua ulta, upie satta main ai
 The 2009 election led by Advani in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, while the BJP was taking an exit poll, at the time, the exit poll sensed that the BJP government would not form, but no one came close to the right figure
 alam ye ki ek channel ke agsit pole ne sabase zyada siten di-218, jabaki asal main upie ko milin 262 siten
 In 2014, the BJP, which was on the chariot of the exit poll's popularity, won in 2014, but all the agencies realized it but only Chanakya agency came close to the right figure, which said in the Agtil poll that BJP will get 340 seats and got 339
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav main ek lahar kaam karti he jise bhaanpana apekshaakrit aasaan hota he
 But can the results of the assembly elections be known from exit polls? Let us understand how the results of the elections held in the last three years were in the shadow of the exit poll
 -2014 main hue maharashtra chunaav main eczit pole sahi sabit hue
 In the Haryana elections held in 2014, exit polls of almost half the agencies proved to be correct
 -jammu-kashmir vidhansabha chunaavon main agsit pole kisi ko bhi bahumat nahin de rahe the or aisa hi hua
 According to exit poll data in Jharkhand, BJP won but nobody could tell the exact figure
 -2015 main hue dilli vidhansabha chunaavon main agsit pole main aam aadmi party kii jeet to bataai, lekin 67 siton kii kalpana koi nahin kar sakaa or ek lihaaj se anderkarant lahar ko bhaanpane main har agsit pole naakaam rahaa
 Exit polls in Bihar proved to be wrong
 -pashchim bengal main aadhi agenciyon ne imtihaan paas kiya
 His exit poll figures were around and the 'didi' government passed again
 -tamilnadu main agsit pole galat sabit hue
 The exit poll, predicting dmk's victory, suffered a setback when the results came in Amma's favor
 -beete saal assam vidhansabha chunaavon main zyaadaatar agsit pols ne bijepi kii banpar jeet kaa anumaan lagaaya tha, jo sahi sabit hua
 In most exit polls in Kerala, the ruling UDF was projected to be evicted and these estimates proved to be correct
 -pudducheri main zyaadaatar agsit pols ke liye anumaan lagaana aasaan sabit hua
 All had predicted the victory of congress-dmk in one voice, which proved to be correct
 -uttarakhand main do bade agsit pole ne bijepi ko jitayaa to do ne congress ke saath baraabar kii takkar dikhaai
 The result was in favor of BJP
 -punjab main haalanki agsit pole ne yah to bhaanp liya tha ki bijepi kii sarkaar nahin ban rahi lekin aam aadmi party or congress ke bich takkar dikhaayi gai jo galat sabit hua
 Exit polls in Goa proved to be wrong
 sabhi ne bijepi ko badhat dikhaayi lekin siten zyada congress kii ai
 It is a different matter that the BJP proved to be 21 from the Congress in the game of electoral manipulation and the BJP formed the government
 -manipur main sirf india today exis kaa agsit pole sateek sabit hua, jisane congress ko 30 se 36 siton ke bich siten di or congress ko 31 siten milin
 In such a situation, exit polls cannot be dismissed outright, but assuming exit polls are absolutely correct, it is also wrong
 gujarat ke chunaav main agsit pole kaa imtihaan isliye zyada he kyonki arase baad bijepi ekatarfa jeet kii taraf badhati nahin dikhi or rahul gandhi jameen par modi se loha lete dikhe
 Predicting the Gujarat results is obviously not easy, but if the exit polls prove to be true in the wind, then it can be said that the BJP can come to power after a bitter fight

 There is an old jumla in politics, enemy's enemy is friend

 Uttar Pradesh may also witness this equation in times to come
 darasal samaajawaadee party netaa ramgopal yadav ne apane dhur virdohi bahujan samaaj party kii mukhiyamayawatiko dosti kaa haath badhaayaa he
 The reason for this is also Narendra Modi and BJP

 However he also said that he is not a fan of Mayamavati

 kyonki unki soch ko sabase behatar satish chandra mishra hi samaj pate hai
 But there is no enemy in politics, only ideology is different

 There is an atmosphere of happiness everywhere

 Junaid's home of hate violence and his village in Haryana are not happy on Eid day
 parivaar or uske gaanv ke log milakar maut kaa insaaf maang rahe hai
 All the villagers who reached Idgah tied the black band on the arms and offered Namaz Ata and protested against the killing of Junaid
 ye tha maamlajunaid hafiz guuruuvaar kii raat local train se dilli se ballabhagarh ja rahe the
 He was 16 years old
 train main bheed ne peet-peet kar maar daalaa
 It happened that Junaid, his brother Hashim and Shakir and neighboring friend Mohsin were returning home from Delhi's Sadar Bazar shopping for Eid
 jab wo train main chadhe to train puri tarah khaali thi, to unhen baithne ke liye seat bhi mil gai
 Later, 20-25 people boarded the train at Okhla
 chadhane main dhakka mukki hui
 At the same time, Junaid was pushed and he fell down
 is par junayd ne kaha ki dhakke kyon maar rahe ho
 Seeing the cap on his head, he said that you are Muslim, a traitor, you are Pakistani, you eat meat and meat
 un logo ne sar se topi hataa di or unki dadhi pakadaney kii koshish kii
 When they tried to stop, they started beating
 aglaa stesan tughluqabad aane tak wo unhen maarthe rahe
 From there, they called their brother and called for help
 unke bade bhai ballabhagarh stesan pahunche
 But on reaching Ballabhgarh, they did not let him get off the train

 When Junaid intervened, he also killed Junaid
 junayd ko unhone itnaa maaraa tha ki wo neeche gir gaye
 He thought that Junaid had died and threw him at the next station, Asavati
 iske baad wo train kii pichhali said se utre jabaki ham plateform se utre
 Then they called the ambulance

 He will be arrested soon

 Also, he said that so far no representative from the government reached here

 Farmers should not be forced to commit suicide, it is the accountability of all of us, but every person working in the field of farming is moving towards suicide, there is not one reason, many different reasons and those different reasons are different
 - Separate analysis should be done

 Therefore, the government of Madhya Pradesh has worked in this direction and the loan that was given to the farmer at 18 percent has been reduced to zero percent
 tomars ne kaha- madhya pradesh main kisaanon kii aatmahatya kii jahaan tak baat he, to har aatmahatya ko kheti or kisaani se jodakar nahin dekhnaa chahie lekin kheti munaafe kii ho, yah bijepi sarkaar kii patibaddhta he

 sundar dikhne ke liye mahilaayein hameshaa se hi kuch na kuch nayaa istemaal karti rahi hai
 In today's run-of-the-mill life, women are often unable to take care of their face, due to which dust starts to appear on their face
 dust ko hataane ke liye roj-roj facial, bleech nahin kiya ja saktaa, lekin ab ek chiz he jiske jariye aap ekadam parfect dikh sakati hai or vah he ‘scrubing‘
 Scrubbing is an excellent remedy for facial cleansing
 scrubing se chehre kii bejaan parat ko aasaani se hataaya ja saktaa he, saath hi isse skin main lacheelaapan bhi aata he
 Often we use cleansing, toning, and moisturizer to clean the face, but facial scrubbing without scrubbing is considered incomplete
 chehre par hone vaale pimple, blike heads ko bhi scrubing ke jariye hataaya ja saktaa he
 The comments market main ab bane banaae scrub milte he, jinke prayog se aap apane chehre par nikhaar laa sakati he
 When applying scrubbing on the face, take care not to remove it until it dries well
 yadi aap chaahe to apane ghar par khud bhi scrubing kar sakati he
 For scrubbing you must first make a paste
 iske liye ek chota chammach santare ke chhilke kaa powder, ek chota chammach pisa hua jau kaa aataa, ek chammach pisa hua dardara baadaam, ek chota chammach masoor kii daal kaa dardara powder, ek chota chammach chaaval ke dardare powder ko aapas main mila len
 Now mix any vegetable or fruit in this paste and apply it on the face
 yadi aapaki skin oili he to scrub main shahad mila len, uske baad ise chehre par applai karen
 It is very important to keep these things in mind while using scrubbing: - Do not use the scrub bought from the market directly on the face, but after adding a few drops of water to it
 market main oili, dry or combination skin ke liye alag-alag scrub milte hai, isliye hameshaa apni skin ke nechar ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sahi scrub kaa chayan karen
 Instead of using simple scrub, use a scrub that contains papaya, apricot and abundant amounts of vitamins A, c and E
 kyonki aise scrub pradushan, dhoop or dhul-mitti se chehre kii raksha karte hai
 For some people, skin does not suit many things, so the mild scrub in the market is a better option for you
 jab bhi scrub kaa istemaal karen, ise gaalon, maathe or chin par adhik lagaae
 Because these parts of the face are most affected by dust
 scrub ke prayog ke baad chehre par moishcharizer kaa istemaal jarur karen

 supreme court ne subrat roy ko karaara jhatka dete hue sahaara samooh ke nae prastaav ko khaarij kar diya he
 Now the possibility of Roy's release before 11 March is over
 aapako bataa den ki court ne 11 march ko sunwaayee kii taarikh tay kii thi or kaha tha ki ve isse pehle bhi niveshkon kaa paisa lautaane kaa prastaav rakh sakate hai
 The Sahara Group on Friday proposed to return Rs 2500 crore to investors within three days, which Sebi disagreed with
 sahaara ne apane prastaav main supreme court se kaha tha ki vah july 2015 tak niveshkon ke saare paise waapas kar degaa
 He said in the proposal that he would pay 2500 crore within three days and the remaining amount in installments every three months
 lekin jab supreme court ne sahaara ke is prastaav par sebi se raay maangi to usne prastaav kaa virodh kiya
 SEBI said that the company is promising to pay only 17,000 thousand crores while the liability is 37,000 crores
 supreme court sahaara ke is prastaav ke baad subrat roy par sunwaayee ke liye special bench banane par raji ho gaya, lekin baad main usne ise bhi khaarij kar diya
 The court said that the proposal of Sahara is an insult to the court
 court kaa kahana tha ki aise aadmi ke liye ikattha hona apmaan kii baat he jo paise lautaanaa hi nahin chahta
 At the same time, Sahara appealed to the Supreme Court today that Subrata Roy and the other two directors be sent to police custody as they are facing difficulty in reaching judicial custody
 is par court ne roy ko apane vakeelon, bete or vittiya salaahkaaron se subah 10 baje se dopaher 2 baje tak milane kii ijaajat de di
 Simultaneously, the Sahara group urged the court to allow Subrata Roy to be released from custody to raise money
 sahaara kaa kahana tha ki jitne zyada samay tak roy hiraasat main rahenge, paise jutaney main utani zyada mushkil hogi
 Let me tell you that Subrata Roy is currently lodged in Tihar Jail
 unhen mangalvaar ko us vakt jail bhej diya gaya jab vah supreme court main jajon ko santusht karne main naakaam rahe
 They could not tell the court how they would refund the amount of 20 thousand crores to their investors

 Vati's 14-year-old daughter Urmila, who lives in Gumnavara area of nabadwad police station area, has been missing since February 17

 He was then seen with his companions, but no information about Urmila could be found

 The police also interrogated the accused man twice, but the investigation was done so lightly that the accused roamed freely

 The video is being told as old, after which concern has also been started to harass her mother about how her daughter will be

 She is screaming, begging for mercy with folded hands, but the beating does not matter
 yah video peedit ladki kii maa tak uske pados main hi rahane vaale raghavendra singh ne pahunchaaya he
 Raghavendra says that the boy who is beating, stays in the locality
 ladki ko pahchaanane ke baad yah video uski maa vati ko dikhaaya to usne bhi use pahchaan liya
 The victim's mother, Vati, says that the girl who is beating in the video is her girl
 usne kai baar police se madad maangi thi, lekin kisi ne nahin suni
 After the video surfaced, he gave a written complaint to the police, complaining against Brijendra Kewat and two unidentified people
 iske baad police ne maamla darj kar jaanch shuru kar di
 On this matter, Senior Superintendent of Police of Jhansi Vinod Kumar Singh has said that an FIR has been registered after the matter comes to cognizance
 jaanch ke baad aropiyon ko pakadaa jayega
 But now the question is why the police remained silent for so many days

 Where and how is the girl now after so long
 yadi ladki nahin mili to kya police ise apni laaparvaahee maanakar jimmedaaron par bhi karrwai karegi

 vahiin, talwaar dampati ne sibiai par aarope lagaaya tha ki jaanch ko modane or kathith rup se kai chizon ko li karke unki chhavi ko 'nuksaan' pahunchaaya gaya
 Under suspicion, the father Rajesh Talwar started his investigation in Uttar Pradesh Police on the basis that Hemraj killed Aarushi and then escaped from the scene
 agle din hemraj kaa shav flats kii chat par milane ke baad shaq kii sui aarushi ke pita rajesh talwaar par aa gai, jise uttar pradesh police ne giraftaar kar liya
 This arrest by the police and that sensational allegation caught the attention of the media that the killer is none other than the teenager's father, who stepped in anger after seeing Aarushi and Hemraj in an objectionable position
 iske baad tatkaaleen mukhyamantri mayawati ne maamle kii jaanch sibiai ko saunp di
 a CBI team led by CBI Joint Director Arun Kumar concluded that the killings were carried out by Vijay Thadrai, an assistant at Talwar's clinic, Vijay Mandal, his friend Rajkumar and Talwar's neighbor's driver
 rajkumaar talwaar ke mitra praphul or anitha kaa gharelu sahaayak tha
 Ashwini Kumar, the then director of CBI, dismissed the conclusion and pointed out the flaws in Arun Kumar's pleas
 sitambar 2009 main kumaar ne sanyukt nideshak javed ahamed or tatkaaleen police adheekshak nilaam kishor ke netritv main ek nayi team kaa gathan kiya or unhen apni team ke sadasyon kaa chunaav karne kii aazaadee di
 The investigation team freed the assistants from suspicion after nearly a year of intensive investigation and indicated the role of Rajesh Talwar on the basis of circumstantial evidence
 adaalat ne diya aadesh, talwaar dampati par chale maamlajanch dal ne 29 disambar 2010 ko maamle main 'aparyaapt saboot' kaa hawala dete hue maamle ko band karne kii report daayar kii
 This was dismissed by District Magistrate Preeti Singh
 unhone aadesh diya ki isamen talwaar dampati ke khilaaf maamla chalaaya janaa chahie
 The court said, "in a case in which the incident happened inside the house, the visible evidence cannot be ignored
" ' talwaar dampati uske baad elahabaad hoicourt gaye, jisane nichali adaalat ke saman or unke khilaaf shuru kii gai sunwaayee ko radd karne kii maang vaali unki yachika khaarij kar di
 The couple approached the Supreme Court, but they were not relieved there either
 sunwaayee kaa silsilaahatya maamle main sunwaayee 11 june 2012 ko shuru hui
 The trial lasted for one and a half years and during this time CBI legal advisor RK Saini produced 39 witnesses in his support
 vahiin, bachaav paksh ne bhi saat gavaah pesh kiye
 On 25 January 2011, a young man also attacked Rajesh Talwar with a sharp weapon in Ghaziabad court premises
 maamle main abhiyojan ne apni antim daleelein 10 oktober ko shuru kin, jabaki bachaav paksh ne apni antim daleelein 24 oktober ko shuru karke use 12 navambar ko puraa kar liya

 India has written a letter to Pakistan asking it to speed up the investigation of Mumbai attacks
 bharat ke videsh sachiv es
 Jaishankar said on Thursday that Pakistan should accelerate in the 2008 Mumbai attacks cases
 jaishankar ne 6 sitambar ko pakistan ke videsh sachiv ko patr likhaa he or yah patr 9 sitambar ko unako handover kiya gaya he
 Giving this information, a spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs has said that Pakistan has suggested several measures to speed up the case of pakistan-mumbai attacks in India

 Vikas Swaroop says that it has been revealed that the people responsible for the Mumbai attack are Pakistanis and the whole conspiracy was hatched in Pakistan itself
 yah baat bhi saamne aa chuki he ki mumbai hamale ke sajeeshkarta pakistan main hi hai
 Eight years later, in the inquiry progress sheet it has been said that this attack is going to be 8 years, but there is no progress in the investigation
 aise main jaanch main teji laane ke liye jaruri he ki kanoonee taur par sahyog karne se jaanch main, sunwaayee main pragati ho sakati he
 Swaroop said, 'this investigation is going on very slowly
 bharat chahta he ki is puure maamle kaa nishkarsh jaldi se saamne aae, kyonki bharat kii koshish hameshaa seatankwaad par ankushalgane kii he
 India has taken this step after the delay in taking forward the case against the conspirators over the Pakistan attacks

 dilli metro main safar karne vaale yatriyon ko free mempanipilane se dmarsi ne inkaar kar diya he
 The petition related to the matter of providing free water facility in the metro was heard in the Delhi High Court
 is dauraan yatriyon ko muft pani dene ke maamle main dmarsi ne haath khadey kar die he
 DMRC said that it has also conducted an internal survey in which people do not need much water during the journey and those who have it can buy water from the metro station for Rs 2 per liter
 metro main yatriyon ko muft pani na dene ko lekardilli hoicourtne pichhali sunwaayee main dmarsi se sakht lahaze main poocha tha ki vah apane yatriyon ko yah moolbhoot suvidha kyon nahin de sakati, jabaki desh ke alag-alag hisson main chal rahi metro main muft pani kii suvidha maujuud he
 Actually, about 27 lakh people travel by metro in Delhi every day
 lihaaja itane logon ko muft pani kii suvidha dene se dmarsi kaa bajet nishchit rup se badhegaa
 And that's why she has been evasive about the facility of giving free water
 dilli hoicourt main janhit yachika sirf muft pani ke liye hi nahin balki saaf-safai ke liye dustbin lagane or yatriyon ko har stesan par toilet kii suvidha dene ko lekar bhi he
 Regarding Dustbin, DMRC and CISF told the court that Dustbin has not been installed inside the metro station in view of security
 agar dustbin lagaae gaye to ye yatriyon kii suraksha ke liye bada khatra ban sakate hai
 Regarding providing toilet facilities, DMRC says that this facility is present at some metro stations and in some places which are toilet for staff, passengers can use it by asking staff
 is yachika main kai mahatvapurn sawaal khadey kiye gaye hai
 For example, water is such a need for which it cannot be denied, but DMRC is not ready to give it to the passengers for free
 jabaki ye suvidha milani isliye bhi jaruri he kyonki metro main badi sankhya main chote bacchon ke saath safar karne vaali mahilaayein or wo bujurg bhi shaamil hai jinhen aksar dawaai khaane ke liye pani kii jarurat hoti he
 However, now on the affidavit of DMRC, the High Court has directed the petitioner to give his reply in 6 weeks

 Nitish's answer: If the government is weak, then we are

 We should be upset

 BJP ministers used to print without doing any work

 un logon ke bayanon ke sandarbh main kripaya mujhe baksh dijie
 RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav lashed out at Chief Minister Nitish Kumar while starting the Save the Constitution journey from Katihar
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki vah desh ko todane or jalaane vaali party bhaajapa kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 Tejashwi said that during the 2015 assembly elections, Nitish Kumar had named BJP as 'bharat Jalao Party', but now he himself is supporting the party that burns India
 tejasvi ne kaha ki nitish kumaar bhaajapa or RSS kaa samarthan kar rahe hai jo ki desh ko baantne or tukade karne main vishwaas rakhte hai
 He said that BJP wants to organize Hindu Muslim riots in the country
 haalanki, tejasvi ne bhaajapa ko chetate hue kaha ki agar bihar main sampradayik hinsa kii ghatana ghategi to argedy eent kaa jawaab pathar se degi
 Speaking on the issue of reservation, Tejashwi alleged that the BJP wants to wrest reservation from Dalits and backward
 bhaajapa ko lalkaarte hue tejasvi ne kaha ki agar kisi maai ke laal main dam he to garibon se aarakshan chin kar dikhaaen
 Speaking on the jdu's consistent demand, Tejashwi said on account of his benami property that the poor and deprived people of Bihar are his real property
 tejasvi ne ek baar phir nitish par janadesh kaa balaatkaar karne kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha ki unhone chor daravaaje se bhaajapa ke saath milakar sarkaar banaai he
 Addressing the meeting of Katihar, Tejashwi said that despite the formation of double engine government in Bihar, why did Bihar not get special state status in the general budget this time? Not only has Bihar not got the status of a special state, but Nitish has definitely got a special bungalow in Delhi from the Center
 desh ke vibhinn hisson main ho rahe sampradayik dange ko lekar bolte hue tejasvi ne kaha ki desh main sampradayik hinsa lagaataar ho rahe hai magar pradhanmantri narendra modi chup baithe hai
 Speaking about his father and RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, Tejashwi said he feels quite proud of his father that he did not compromise his ideology despite being intimidated and threatened by the BJP
 tejasvi ne kaha ki jail jane se pehle unke pita lalu prasad ne kaha tha ki tejasvi ko bihar kii janata kii raksha kerani chahie or aisa karne ke liye hi vah janata ke bich aae hai
 Tejashwi said that if Lalu Prasad had to spend 100 years in jail for fighting communal forces, he would accept it
 lalu prasadko sher bataate hue tejasvi ne kaha ki unke pita nirdosh hai or desh kii tamaam jaanch agenciyaan unke parivaar ko badnaam karne ke liye lagi hai
 In this phase of cow protection, the Maharashtra government introduced a bill to protect journalists and also passed
 bijepi ne chunavi vaada kiya tha jo puraa ho gaya
 If this bill is passed then attacking journalists or media institutions in Maharashtra would be a punishable offense
 media santhaan ke prabandhan yani management ko is kanoon se koi laabh nahin hoga kyonki unhen is kanoon ke tahat sangrakshan nahin milegaa
 Our colleague Prasad Kathe told that under this contract, online, freelance journalists will also get protection and it will be a non-bailable offense
 bill ke anusaar patrkaar par hamalaa karne vaale ko 3 saal kii sazaa hogi or 50 hazaar kaa jurmaana hoga
 Those who do wrong things under the cover of journalism will also get the same punishment
 patrkaar par hamalaa karne waalon ko uske ilaaj kaa karch uthaanaa hoga
 The attacker at the media institution must compensate for the loss
 maharashtra va anya rajyon main doctoron kii suraksha ke liye bhi kanoon he
 In this way different laws will be made for everyone, then one day Lawyer Security Act, MLA Security Law, Pilot Safety Law, Airhostesses Security Law will also be made
 tab ek din koi garib jayega or kahegaa sarkaar hamaari suraksha ke liye bhi kanoon bana do
 The most protection that journalists need at this time is to get their news published and where they work, at least journalism should be done according to their values

 Apart from violence, politics in the name of cow protection, there are many such stories in the context of these issues which, if we know, can help us understand the political issue better
 gau raksha ko lekar tivi or akhabaaron par chalane vaali bahasein har ghatana ke baad unheen saare daavon ke saath haazir ho jaati hai
 Just as many people were surprised by the fact that Aspect Khan was a spinach, bought a cow for the milk business in Ramadan
 hamaare sahyogi harsha ne ek report bheji he marwar muslim adarsh gaushala kii
 This is a Gaushala in Bujwad village on Barmer Road, Jodhpur
 2004 se chal rahi is gaushala ko moulana azaad skool ke sanchaalak chalaate hai
 People in nearby villages get sick when they become ill, helpless and are not in a position to provide milk
 isliye nahin ki tab unhen gaayon se pyaar nahin rah jaataa, isliye bhi gaay paalane vaale biimaar or budhi gaay kaa karcha nahin uthaa sakate hai
 So leave the vaccine
 kuch log to kasaai ko bech dete hai magar bahut log gaay ko bechney kii himmat nahin juta pate hai
 So Atik Mohammad sahib brings such cows to his cowshed
 yahaan 200 se adhik gaayen hai
 Everyone's sick and helpless
 inke ilaaj ke liye pashu chikitsak hai, ebulence bhi he or dur daraaj ke gaavon main jaakar ilaaj bhi karvaa dete hai
 Atiq Mohammad said that they also run schools where children from all communities attend
 yahi nahin, atik ahamed kii gaushala main biimaar gaayon kaa naam bhi rakhaa jaataa he
 Ganga, Jamuna, Saraswati, Anandi, Anjali, Anjuri, Geeta, Modki, Kalki, Anoth, Dholki, Kanchudi, Sita, Lakshmi
 atik kii gaushala main gaayon ke ye naam hai
 a cow is also named Sultan and Mumtaz
 atik mohammad ne kaha ki ve ahsaan nahin kar rahe balki apana farz nibhaa rahe hai
 Their gaushala gate is not closed and cows are not tied
 kyonki baandh dene se gaay keechad main der tak rahati he isse uske khur yani paanv kharaab ho jate hai or khadi nahin rah paati he
 i did not make this story so that after listening to it, you become quarrelsome in film style and become secular
 main ummid bhi nahin karata
 The poison that has been mixed in our mind will go back generations, not the story of Atiq Mohammad
 hamen samajhnaa hoga ki hamaari krishi vyavastha main maveshi paalan anivaary ang he
 There are countless cattle fairs from Rajasthan to Bihar
 bahut se samudaay aise hai jo gaayon ke jhund ko lekar ek rajya se duusare rajya chale jate hai taaki unhen hari ghaas mil sake
 The politics of cow protection is imposing the complexities of law on these ordinary people

 (from input language) maut ek sach he
 But untimely death raises many questions
 yahi maut jab rahasy ban jaae, to musiibat ban jaati he
 The death of many people in India is still a mystery
 siyaasi hastiyon se lekar filmi sitaron tak, kai aise naam hai, jinaki maut ke rahasy se aaj tak pardaa nahin uth sakaa he
 It also included the name of Bollywood actress Sridevi
 yun to shridevi kii maut ek haadasa bataai ja rahi he
 The Dubai Police has also closed the case
 lekin sawaal khadey karne vaale tamaam tarah kii daleel de rahe hai
 Some people say that when Sridevi did not drink alcohol, how did alcohol come into her body? It is being said that why did not Sridevi leave the hotel for 48 hours? From a legal perspective, Sridevi's death is an accident, but in the same way as the death of famous actress Divya Bharti
 90 ke dashak main yuvaaon kii dil kii dhadkan ban chuki divya bharti kii maut bhi kuch isi tarah hui, jisane puure desh ko jhakzor diya
 Divya, who was charmed by beauty and tremendous acting, died in her own house
 unki maut ko bhi haadasa bataaya gaya
 Divya fell down from the window of her own house

 At the same time, she slipped from the balcony of the house and fell down

 Most of the films are from 1991 to 1993
 3 april, 1993 main flats kii khidki se phisalkar girane se divya kii rahasyamayi maut ho gai
 In the police report, falling from the balcony on alcohol intoxicants was cited as the cause of death
 kuch logon ne unki maut ko hatya bataaya tha
 Her husband Sajid Nadiadwala was suspected of this
 divya kii maut ke samay sajid film 'laadla' shuru karne vaale the, jisamen shridevi ne kaam kiya
 The death of Divya, entangled between murder and suicide, is still a mystery
 police file band kar chuki he
 In the same way as today, the file of Sridevi's death has also been closed
 bataate chalem ki 24 farvari ko dubai ke jumaira emirates tower hotel ke cameraa number 2201 main shridevi kaa nidhan ho gaya

 Sanjay denied the allegations and told the police that the ties were made by mutual consent

 'super nani' ke alaava is hafte 'baagh bachaao', yani 'seve da tiger' ke sandesh ke saath banaai gai 'ror' bhi release hui he, jise diarect kiya he camel sadana ne, jo bollywood main hero rah chuke hai, tathaa bataur nirdeshak yah unki pehali film he
 
 
 The story of 'roar' takes place in the Sunderbans, where a wildlife photographer rescues a white tiger child from the clutches of smugglers and brings it to his home, but the mother of this child arrives at the photographer's house to find him and Kills
 
 
 photographer ke bhai pandit ko jab yah khabar milti he to vah baghin se badla lene ke liye kuch saathiyon ke saath sunderbans aata he
 
 
 Pandit is a commando and is played by Abhinav Shukla
 
 
 yahaan pandit kii madad karti hai, jhumpa, jo ek trekar hai, or yah kirdaar nibhaayaa he himarsha venkatsami ne
 
 
 Now in the film these people are in search of tigers, and tigers are in search of them
 
 
 iske saath hi inkaa takaraav hota he jaanwaron ke taskaron se, jiskaa mukhiya he bhira, jiske kirdaar main dikhenge subrat datta
 
 
 Now let's first talk about the shortcomings of the film
 
 
 kahani main dam nahin
 
 
 While the script is weak, the dialogue also seems childish
 
 
 puri film main tark dhundhna mushkil he
 
 
 For example, the story behind the snakes of this forest
 
 
 agar acting kii baat karun to zyaadaatar abhinayta film main kachche khilaadi dikhe hai
 
 
 Abhinav Shukla and Himarsha Venkatasamy are slightly better, but the rest of the actors have only been able to make a presence in the film, though Subrata Dutta in Bhira's character looks good
 
 
 ab baat karte hai, khoobiyon kii
 
 
 Cinematographer Michael Watson of the film has done amazing work in many places
 
 
 'ror' ke special effects bhi aapako achche lagenge
 
 
 Kamal Sadana should be praised for this, as he raised a subject which was difficult to film
 
 
 nirdesan main unhen abhi or mehnat kii zarurat he
 
 
 The background score struck me loud
 
 
 jin logon ne jaanwaron par bani hollywood filmein nahin dekhi hai, unhen 'ror' main baagh ko dekhakar hairat ho sakati he
 
 
 However, at the same time, in the end, the director has also told how he got the tigers to work in the film
 
 
 aakhir main aap film kii mekking dekhnaa shaayad pasand karen
 
 
 There is also a good thing that the film has not tried to force, but overall the film lacks a good story
 
 
 vaise, masala filmon se hatakar kuch alag dekhnaa chaahate hai to aap 'ror' dekh sakate hai
 
 
 The rating of the film from my side is - 2
 5 star
 
 
 4–0–24–5

 com / dz4ubi4qiv mamata banerjee kii party trinmul congress ne jamini str par bhrashtachar par nakel kasne ke liye anokhi pahal kii he
 The party is taking an affidavit in writing from its candidates for the panchayat elections
 unase likhvaya ja rahaa he ki ve kisi nijee contractor, kaarobaar yaa avaidh ret khanan main shaamil nahin honge
 Hundreds of people seeking party tickets have signed and submitted the affidavit
 tiemasiki ore se prakashit halafname main likhaa gaya he- 'main shapath letaa hum ki agaratranmul congresane mujhe namit kiya or main gram panchayat yaa panchayat samiti kaa sadsy nirvaachit hua to meraa parivaar (sarkari) yojanaon yaa kheti ke upkarnon kaa laabh nahin legaa, naa hi party kii anumati ke bina mere prabhaav kaa agle paanch saal tak istemaal karegaa
 Nor will i associate with any private contractor business, illegal sand mining or toll booths
 '272 gram panchayat, 46 panchayat samiti or 4 jila parishad siton ke lietiemasi ummidawaronse likhit halafanama liye ja rahe hai
 These affidavits were issued by the party's Goghat Block 1 unit in Hooghly district
 goghat se tiemasi vidhayak maanas majumdaar ne kaha, 'party kii chhavi ko behatar karne ke liye hamane ye kadam uthaaya he
 Also, it will improve the opinion of the public representatives about the people
 hamaare saare ummidavaaron ko ye likhit main dena he ki ve kisi nijee contractor kaarobaar yaa avaidh khanan main shaamil nahin honge
 Such activities have spoiled the party's name in the past
 'majumdaar ke mutabik panchayat ke liye namakan bharne vaale har ummidavaar ko apni vittiya sthiti bataane ke saath ye bhi saaf karnaa hoga ki wo janaseva ke liye kitna samay dene ko taiyaar he
 This is because when his tenure is over, people can compare his status from five years ago
 party kii ore se ummidavaaron ko die jane vaale form main 15 sawaal hai, jinamein ummidavaaron kii nijee jaankaree ke alaava, paariwarik aay or purv main agar kisi raajnneetik dal se judaav rahaa he, ye bhi bataanaa hoga
 However, the BJP has targeted this exercise of the Trinamool Congress
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki isse sabit hota he ki arinmul netritv kaa naata kis had tak bhrashtachar ke saath rahaa he
 BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, 'their leaders are involved in all kinds of illegal activities in the state whether it is coal theft, sand mining or smuggling of cows
 is tarah ke likhit halafnaamon se jamini str par koi badlaav nahin hoga
 Today people join the Trinamool to make a fortune, they have no ideology
 ' Golagokarnanath in the Terai area of lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh is originally known for its Shiva temple
 aasthaavadi ise ramayana yug kaa mandir or is sthaan ko mini kaashi kehete hai
 In the eyes of corporate historians, Golagokarnath came into the limelight when Jamnalal Bajaj opened the first sugar mill there in 1931 with the inspiration of Mahatma Gandhi
 vidambnaa dekhie ki is factory ko lekar hinsak sangharsh hua, jisamen khun ek boond bhi nahin gira
 In 2000, Kushagra Bajaj returned to India with a master's degree in marketing from Kellogg School, North Western University, USA
 phir unhone parivaar kaa yah kaarobaar sambhaal liya
 He felt that he would earn a name by this, but he soon realized that there was no need for him much

 He was controlled by Jamnalal's grandchildren Rahul and Shishir (both Kamalnayan's sons) and Shekhar, Neeraj and Madhur (all three Ramakrishna's sons)
 in paanchon main itnaa apnaapan tha ki yah bataa paanaa mushkil tha ki koun sagaa bhai he or koun chachera
 Rahul was the head of the business as well as the family
 chaaron unase salaah lekar kaam karte the
 The partition was first talked about by Rahul's close brother Shishir
 2001 main ek paariwarik samaaroh main ve bol pade ki ve alag hokar apane prabandh vaale chini (bajaj hindustan) or personal care (ab bajaj corp) kaarobaar saath rakhana chaahate hai
 Nobody paid much attention to his words
 chah maheene baad shishir ne maang phir doharaai
 By now everyone knew that Shishir was actually repeating the words of son Kushagra
 shishir ne apane man kii baat bete se akele main kahi, ''maine jo kuch banaaya he, use bikher mat dena
 In the subsequent 13 years, Shishir did not get frustrated
 2008 main unke hisse kaa kaarobaar paariwarik samjhaute ke baad aupchaarik rup se unke or kushagra ke naam ho gaya
 His companies had a turnover of Rs 400 crore in 2001-02

 The Kushagra would no longer be called sugar producers by origin

 Tomorrow, the scope of his identity outside India may be increased
 unka kahana he, ''ham desh se baahar kuch nayaa kaarobaar karne kii soch rahe hai

 This was indicated when Kushagra had spent Rs 4,500 crore for setting up 12 new sugar mills in four years by 2007
 kaa nivesh kiya taaki ve asia main sabase bade chini utpaadak ban saken
 This was the first business that Kushagra adopted with full force and spread rapidly

 During all this, Kushagra did not forget his roots

 ab yah kaarobaar pehle jitna phaayde vaala nahin rahaa
 The central government has control over the prices of sugar and the state governments are increasing the sugarcane prices to please the farmers for their vote bank
 si
 The Economic Advisory Council of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh headed by Rangarajan had said that sugarcane prices should be linked to sugar prices, but states like Uttar Pradesh did not listen to them

 Otherwise, the future is dark
