 According to the new provision, candidates up to the age of 40 will be able to appear in the examination
 in padon par niyukti ke liye adhiktam umr seemaa main sanshodhanashaskeey sevaaon main sidhi bhartee ke liye adhiktam aayu main badlaav kiya gaya he
 According to which the candidates preparing for the government job will now be able to appear in the exam for 40 years
 ye nirdesh sarkaar kii ore se sabhi vibhaagon ko guuruuvaar ko jari kiye gaye hai
 It states that the age limit will now be 21 to 40 years for applying to the gazetted and non-gazetted posts through Public Service Commission in open competition
 kya hai shaskeey sevaaon main sidhi bhartee ke nae nirdeshrajya sarkaar ke nirdesh main kaha gaya he ki lok seva ayog kii paridhi se baahar ke tritiy or chaturth shrenee padon ke liye aayu seemaa 18 se 40 varsh rahegi
 There will be a relaxation of five years in the maximum age limit for Scheduled Castes, Tribes, Other Backward Classes, women etc

 Last month, on June 10, the government, citing the directions of the Supreme Court, had increased the maximum age limit for the candidates from the state and outside the state to 35 years in the Public Service Commission examination

 ye bada hi mushkil sawaal he jab koi ye poochta he ki prem ke bare main aap kya sochati hai? usase bhi zyada mushkil jab is ehsaas ko shabdon kii seemaa main baandhne kii hidaayat de di jaae
 This is just like if someone tells you to tell your autobiography in a sentence, just as a living life cannot be included in a book like a sentence, a word but an autobiography, similarly love is accounted for
 aashcharya kii baat ye ki duniya main logon ne is viraat bhav or ehsaas ko bhi ek din ke utsav main baandhakar jeene or jashn manaane kii koshish kii he par ye bhi thik he kam se kam saal main ek din to ofishili ghoshit hua prem ke liye
 This is as if one day in the year has been declared as Woman's Day and what happens in practice is a different matter
 vailemtine de ko pasand karne na karne yaa maanane na maanane ke alag-alag paksh hai mere saamne pehla to ye jisase ki meri asahmati he– mujhe lagata he prem aisa bhav he jo har kshan, har din ham jite hai
 When you are in love to har din khaas hota he
 Every moment is special
 or prem har din, har kshan or kshanansh ko vishisht banaata he
 The public has a different opinion on every issue, every feeling and it is very natural
 i don't think there is a day when your boyfriend or girlfriend is special, you buy expensive gifts for them, nice clothes , Perfume, flowers, bouquets, chocolate etc
, make them feel special
 main ye nahin kah rahi ki ye pregent or pregentation galat he
 i just mean that why is there a need for a particular day? Such occasions should come every day on every occasion when you make your love not just special but super special
 prem apane aap main ek utsav he use kisi ek din kii darkaar nahin
 For us lovers, Valentine's is and should be everyday
 rahi baat isaki ki premi yugal ke liye ye prapoj karne kaa sahi din or mauka hota he to ye baat bhi mujhe bahut bachakaani lagati he
 What is the logic of the right time and the right day to express the impulses of the heart? If your luck is right, fire is on both sides, then it is impossible for lovers like us to wait till valentines
 wo ishk hi kya jisame izhaar main bhi itnaa sabar rakhaa jaae? so mere liye is tark se bhi vailemtine de kaa mahatv bahut samaj main nahin aata
 i only understand its significance or usefulness in that it is also an opportunity, an occasion when you make your love more special
 apane-apane tareekon se pyaar kii anubhutiyon ko saghanta se mahasoos karne ke liye puri jindagi kam padati he
 Here is a matter of one day? The significance of Valentine's Day is only in the fact that if you are not able to propose someone then this opportunity gives you courage
 jaise holi main aap lagbhag azaad hote hai kisi ke gaal par halkaa sa gulaal malane ke liye
 Taking the relaxation, the enthusiasm of the festival comes naturally in you
 ye thik usee prakaar he khaas diwas ke prabhaav main kii gayi himmat or acchhee sarthak shuruyaat he
 For me love is such an absolute necessity of life without which it is difficult to be comfortable
 is zarurat ke ansh bhar ko bhi agar is ek din samajha yaa samajhaayaa ja sake, dikhaaya ja sake, bataaya ja sake, jataayaa ja sake or ye din koi bhi alakh jagaa sake to aise vailemtine kaa swaagat he

 Joshi demanded the immediate dismissal of p Chidambaram from the Union Council of Ministers, saying that the country's Finance Minister was Chidambaram at the time of pricing of blocks in KG Basin (krishna Godavari Basin) and the cag's leaked report on the KG Basin dispute if true It is very dangerous for the country
 unhone kaha ki keji basin maamle main sieji kii jo report li hokar saamne ai he vah kitni sach he yaa kitni galat, yah to samay batayega lekin jis prakaar sarkaar ne uskaa khandan nahin kiya he usase prathit hota he ki li hui report sach he
 He questioned that if the leaked report in the KG Basin case is genuine then why is the central government preventing journalists from publishing or discussing it
 joshi ne maang kii ki keji basin maamle main kaig kii report ko sarkaar sansad ke monsoon satr main sansad ke saamne pesh kare or is report ke aadhaar par doshi logon ke khilaaf tatkaal karrwai sunishchit kare
 Joshi, while discussing the CAG report on the KG Basin, directly questioned the Central Government and said that the government should state what the conditions were laid for the project, what was the estimated expenditure on it
 unhone sawaal kiya ki sarkaar yah bhi bataae ki aakhir chaar vashren main hi keji basin main prakritik gas kii khoj kaa kharch chaar guna kaise ho gaya ? jab is pariyojna kii sharten tay kii gayi us samay desh kaa vitt mantri koun tha ? us samay sambhddha vibhaagon main adhikari koun the 
 He said that recently Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa has also accused the country's Home Minister p Chidambaram of election result scam which should be investigated immediately and the situation should be clarified
 joshi ne maang kii ki aise ghotalebaj mantri ko tatkaal mantri parishad se hataaya jaae anyathaa yah desh kii suraksha or aarthik sthiti ke liye baari khatra ban saktaa he

 'jali ko aag kehete hai, buji ko raakh kehete hai or us raakh se bane barood ko' raajnneetik party kaa 'pravaktaa' kehete hai
 In this world, if a person can think very positive at the same time and negative at the same time like bloodthirsty mother-in-law, then he is the spokesperson of political parties
 apni party kii har yojana ko aitihaasik or virodhiyon ke har kadam ko nindaneey, khaarij, bhartsana, virodh jaise shabdon se navajane main ek acha party pravaktaa der nahin lagaataa he
 But the thing to think and understand in all this is that even though a party spokesperson says something with his mouth, there must be some truth and things going on in his mind
 aage jaaniye sawaal, jawaab or man kii baat ke combo ke saath ek badi raajnneetik party ke pravaktaa kii udhedbun
 Question: Why have your party mps been making inflammatory statements? Answer: See, you are getting it wrong

 The media is unable to understand and the opposition is trying to surround it
 man kii baat:kah to tum sahi hi rahe ho guru
 But what to do, the intelligence of the high command has turned again
 hamako tikat diya hota to ham izzat bana dete
 But not them, this is Tipiri Chand
 apana to bolke nikal liye, fanse to ham maasoom pravaktaa na
 Question: In the matter of stopping development and inflation, your government is failing, what do you have to say? Answer: No, you can take the figures and see
 pichhali sarkaar kii tulana main hamane phalane suchakank main itane point hasil kar liye hai
 We are also working on several other schemes
 man kii baat:are sasur, ham khud hi pareshaan hai
 If we are spokespersons, then our salary is a little more than ours
 party mukhyalay ja nahin pate hai to chaat pochh bhi nahin kar pate hai
 We go with wife to take the goods, so let's say 'let's look forward' saying that our mouth also starts hurting
 har thele main daam aasmaan chhu rahe hai
 But if you speak in front of you, then you will also eat the same statement by running a big statement of flour
 sawaal:aapaki party ke 'uttaradhikari' ne apane hi sansadeey ilaake kaa daura kyon nahin kiya?jawaab:main aapako bataa dena chahta hum ki puraa desh unka apana he
 He loves every countryman, he will also go to his area
 man kii baat:are ham khud pareshaan hai
 If we go out to celebrate our holiday, we are being burnt here sitting in a bright camera light
 kitni baar unase kaha he ki baba ye karo baba wo karo
 But then listen

 Question: Your government is starting to ban a lot
 bif or megi par bain iske taaja udhaaharan hai?jawaab:bharat ek bhaawanaaon vaala desh he
 Do not hurt anyone's feelings and stay healthy
 sarkaar isi ke maddenjar bain laga rahi he
 Mann Ki Baat: Bhaiji is telling the truth
 jab se ye bain hua he
 Our Nandoi has drunk our blood
 bif ke shaukeen hai
 If you do not get it due to the ban, then you are in the process of getting jugaad from us
 or megi kii to pucho hi na
 Little girls used to eat with such passion, now if there is a ban, then where to get the lock
 chunaav haar jaao, baddua detii rahati he gusse main
 You will not understand our pain
 sawaal:aapaki party karibiyon ko mauka detii he
 Caught in degree controversy, election losers become ministers
 kya kahana he?jawaab:hamaari party swasth loktantr kii pakshdhar he
 a good minister is identified by his experience and not by degree
 man kii baat:karibiyon ko tikat na den to kya tumko de den
 You keep sitting in a suit tie, what use are you? saamne board main pard padhake to bolte ho
 Shoes should be worn, we should burn blood and we do not get tickets
 rahi baat degree kii to, abe hamase na hi bulawaao
 We ourselves are the tenth fellows but sitting with you for an hour or not is gossiping
 kya fark rah gaya tum main or ham main
 Budbak somewhere

 aakhir bijepi ko aisa karne main itnaa samay kyon lag rahaa he? dekhiye 8 badi baaten

 jaateey santulan saadhane kii koshishbijapi ko mili kareeb 40 fisadi vot main ek bada hissaa gaiyr yadav pichhadon kaa he, jo ki puure pradesh ke total vot share kaa lagbhag 44 fisadi hota he
 In such a situation, the first attempt was to make this class easier for the 2019 elections
 is varg kii ore se sabase pehla naam keshav prasad maury kaa he, lekin pradesh main unke anubhav kii kami aade aa rahi he

 rajnath singh par ekamat nahirajanath singh pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri or rajputon ke rajya ke sabase bade netaa hai
 Rajputs are considered a strong vote base of the BJP in the state
 is chunaav main bhi unhone kaaphi had tak bijepi ko hi vot kiya he
 The elected MLA in the state has more than five dozen Rajputs
 lekin rajnath singh ko lekar bhi party main ek mat nahin bana to iske peeche unka purana kaam kaam or pradesh main oonchi jatiyon ke sabase bade vot bank brahmanon main unako lekar anmanaapan he
 His relationship with the Brahmin leaders of the state was never considered sweet and during the time of Rajnath Singh, the bjp's graph in the state also continued to fall
 ek or mahatvapurn baat yah he ki siem kaa chunaav 2019 ke modi plan ke hisaab se kiya janaa he or aise main yojanaon ke tej kriyanvayan ke liye yuva chehre kii darkaar he
 3
 manoj sinha ke liye vot bank he dikkatamanoj sinha rajya main bhoomihaar voton ke sabase bade naam hai
 However Bhumihar vote is not much in the state
 is chunaav main manoj sinha ke chehre par bhoomihaar vot bijepi kii jholii main gaye
 Manoj Sinha has also created a good image during his work at the center
 sinha ko modi or amit shah ke plan main sabase feet mana ja rahaa he or vikaas kii sadak par bhi manoj sinha tej chal sakate he, yah baat dilli ke galiyare main maani ja rahi he
 But the party definitely faces the problem of vote bank
 pradesh main jaateey raajnneeti kaa ganit thodaa unke khilaaf jaataa he

 vijan 2019pradesh kekesaria rangamein rangane ke baavjood bhi party agar kisi ko abhi tak chun nahin pai he to iskaa bada kaaran 2019 main loksabhaa chunaav kii chintaa he
 The Modi government's biggest strength came from 71 mps from UP
 ab modi kii najar 2019 main is pradarshan ko dohraane kii he or modi kii najar aise candidet par he jo vikaas ke dam par vot maangane main modi or amit shah kii madad kar sake
 The same exercise to elect a chief minister continues till now and no one has been finalized
 5
 Co-ordination with the vision of Modi and development of all is a face in Modi and Amit Shah's plan for this slogan, which is acceptable in the entire state
 raajnneeti main puraane pad chuke chehron ke saath puraane vivaad bhi jude he aise main jeet kar aae vidhayakon main se bhi aise chehre kii talash kii ja rahi he jo is bisaat par baith kar sahi se khel sake
 During the screening of new faces, it is being monitored that even though the face is new, his vision matches Modi's vision and there is no dispute with him
 6
 In the entire election, Modi had to get entangled with the statements of his own party leaders, so the party is looking for a balanced-minded youth to complete such a development project away from rhetoric that appears on the ground in the next two years
 Give

 There should not be any missed face due to not being named finalists
 There is also a view in the party that there is not much time left for 2019, so the mistake cannot be rectified by changing the person sitting in the middle of the post
 There is a round of discussion not to miss it either

 The likes of the Sangh should also be searched for such faces, which the Sangh can also believe in and can also run the development agenda
 yuva netritv kii talash isliye bhi he kyonki 2019 main party ko sabase badi chunauti akhilesh ke chehre se milegi

 Nearly three thousand people had illegally occupied a plot of more than 260 acres in Jawahar Bagh under the leadership of a man named Ramvriksha Yadav for the last two years
 in logon ne yahaan shivi sthapit kar liya tha
 Police tried several times to evacuate it
 is hinsa main satyagrah ke naam se saalon tak sarkaar or kanoon ke muhafizon kii naak main dam karne vaale ramavriksh yadav bhi maaraa gaya tha
 This largest accused in the Mahabharata of Mathura was a resident of Ghazipur in UP
 yah pehle jayagurudev kaa shishy hua karata tha
 When the lentils of Ramvriksha, which claimed the Guru's legacy, did not turn, he broke away from them
 yahi nahin usne guru ke ashram par hamale kii sajeesh bhi rachi thi
 Even today, people have not forgotten the sensational Dastantezab incident of Jawaharbagh case and the acid attack of Bahubali leader Shahabuddin Behar

 This is the case due to which Shahabuddin had to go to jail

 With Shahabuddin coming into the discussion, this matter is once again reminding people of the dreadful incident, which is known as acid attack
 baat varsh 2004 kii he
 Chandreshwar Prasad alias Chanda Babu lived with his wife, daughter and four sons in Siwan district of Bihar
 unki mukhya bazaar main do dukaane thim
 One grocery and the other groceries
 ek dukaan par unka betaa satish baithta tha, duusare par girish
 The day of August 16, 2004 came as a doom for the family
 kuch log chanda babu se rangadari maang rahe the
 But he refused to give
 vahi log us din unki kiraane kii dukaan par ja pahunche
 His son Satish sat at the shop
 un logon ne satish se rangadari ke do lakh rupee maange
 Satish said to give 30-40 thousand rupees
 rangadari vasuulne aae log zyada the
 They had weapons in their hands
 un logon ne satish ke saath marpet shuru kar di
 Also took out more than two lakhs kept in the flock
 satish kaa bada bhai bhi vahaan aa gaya
 He too was watching everything
 pitane ke baad satish ghar main gaya
 And brought the acid cleaning the bathroom into a mug
 sara tejaab usne rangadari vasuulne aae badmaashon par phenk diya
 The acid splashed on his brother Rajiv
 sivaan ke tejaab cond kii khaufnak daastaan The government, which is constantly surrounded by rising prices of petrol and diesel, has now started looking for ways to provide relief
 sutron ke mutabik sarkaar ne iskaa rasta dhund nikaala he
 For this, the government will not cut excise duty and VAT, instead it is going to bring forward the oil producer companies
 centre sarkaroyal and natural gas corporation limited(ongc) or oil india limited (OIL) jaisi gharelu tel nirmaataa companiyon ke sahare aam aadmi ko petrol or dijal kii badhati keemton se raahat dilaane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 It is being told that she can bring a new 'tax' for this
 yah tex sarkari or gaiyr-sarkari, donon hi tarah kii tel companiyon par lagegaa
 How will the news agency told PTI, "this new tax, which can come in the form of cess
" yah tab-tab lagu kiya jayega, jab bhi kaccha tel 70 dollar ke paar nikal jayega
 In fact, these oil companies are also paid at the international rates for the oil produced domestically
 sarkaar kii yojana yah he ki jab bhikaccha tel70 dollar ke paar jayega, to ye companiyaan apane munaafe kaa hissaa ful retailor ke saath baantengi
 In such a situation, fuel retailers will be able to control the impact of increased crude oil prices
 isse petrol or dijal ke daam betahasha na badhane se aam aadmi ko raahat milegi
 This method has been adopted earlier also, this is not the first time that the government is asking the psus to bear the rising cost
 isse pehle bhi oengisi or oil india ne under recoverij 40 fisadi tak bhugtan kiya he
 In fact, the government had fixed a maximum price
 uske upar badhane vaali keemton kaa asar tel companiyon ko apane upar lenaa padataa tha
 In this way, these companies had taken the burden of subsidy given by the government for 13 years
 2015 main khatm hui thi sabsadisarkaar kii taraf se petrol or dijal par di jane vaali yah sabsidi june, 2015 main khatm hui thi
 Earlier in 2008, the suggestion to impose such a tax was also being worked out, but the proposal was not implemented after opposition from Cairn India
 ab ek baar phir sarkaar oil produsar companiyon par 'windfall tex' lagane kii taiyaari kar rahi he

 governor se milane ke baad pidipi netaa mehabooba mufti ne media ke zarie bijepi par dabaav banane kii sidhi koshish kii
 He neither denied the possibility of forming a government with the BJP nor did he talk of going with the BJP
 ulta 55 vidhayakon ke saath kii baat kar aisa tir choda jo kai dishaao main ek saath jaataa prathit hota he
 Mehbooba also did not directly claim the 55 mlas, but cited the mathematics being put in the media
 or media ye hisaab pidipi ke 28 ke alaava congress ke 12 or ensi ke 15 vidhayakon ko jod kar laga rahaa he
 That is, put the Grand Alliance of pdp-congress-nc in front
 lekin aisa bhi nahin he ki mehabooba sidhe sidhe is mahagathbandhan par vikalp ke taur par sweekaarti nazar aayi
 Rather, it seems to be trying to give this message to the BJP that if we want to form a government by tying up with us, we have to obey our conditions
 gyaat ho ki pidipi kii taraf se bijepi ke saamne mukhya taur par jin sharton kii baat charchaa main hai, unamem pidipi kaa puure paanch saal tak mukhyamantri or anuchhed 370 va afsapa jaise kaanoon par kuch aashwaasan chaahati he
 Whereas BJP wants a Chief Minister for 3–3 years alternately and first BJP Chief Minister
 donon partiyaan apni sharton se peeche hatane ko taiyaar nahin tabhi bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kaa kahana he ki sabhi partiyaan apni posishan par dati hai isliye sarkaar nahin ban paa rahi he
 Mehbooba mentioned the time of Atal Bihari Bajpai by showing political acumen that the PDP wants to carry forward the political process with Vajpayee as the political process started on Jammu and Kashmir
 zaahir he wo pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saamne vaajapeyi jaisi badi lakeer khinch kar ek chunauti pesh karne kii koshish kar rahi hai jise paar karne na karne kii zimmedaari wo modi par hi daalana chaahati hai
 He tried to show this mandate as 'divisive' by saying that we are in the valley and trying to show that the BJP and 'decisive' in Jammu, that the total deposit is the democratic culmination of the mandate of Jammu and Kashmir as an alliance of BJP and BJP
 Should be at
 
 
 jo unhone saafe taur par nahin bolaa wo ye ki 'pidipi kii sharton par'
 The PDP has a dilemma that if the government is formed with the BJP, it will not get the chief minister's post, and if it is not made with it, there can be obstacles in the help of the central government
 bijepi ke saath jane par ghati main wo apni zamin kho sakati he or nahin jane par dilli main apni pahunch
 Therefore, despite being the largest party, it has not yet claimed to form the government
 congress pidipi ko samarthan kaa sidhaa elaan kar chuki he, jabaki ensi abhi tak chausar bicha kar khel rahi he
 It is also giving the illusion of alliance with the PDP and can also take a break with the BJP in the event of a divorce between the PDP-BJP before marriage
 pidipi ensi kii is raajnneeti ko samajhati he isliye wo ensi kaa saath lene se ab tak manaa nahin kar rahi kyonki agar kal ko ensi bijepi ke saath gai to pidipi ghati main ensi ke samarthan ke us phool ko pathar bana ke maar sake jise ensi ne pidipi par barasaane kaa swaang rachaa tha
 Overall, the PDP is trying to convert its defeat into a winnable number to form a government
 bijepi or ensi bhi lanbaa gheraa daal kar khel rahi he
 The Delhi High Court today upheld the conviction of the three convicts including Vikas Yadav, son of Uttar Pradesh politician DP Yadav, in the 2002 kidnapping and murder case of Nitish Katara, saying it was a case of murder for the sake of false pride

 The court has heard all five petitions
 court ne peedita kii maa or abhiyojak kii yachikaaon ko doshiyon kii yachikaaon se alag rakhane kaa nirnay liya he
 The prosecution had alleged that Vikas and Vishal did not accept Katara's alleged love affair with her sister
 vikaas or vishaal ko nichali adaalat ne 2008 main doshi qaraar diya tha
 His associate, Pahalwan, was prosecuted separately and was sentenced to life imprisonment by a lower court
 vah kuch samay tak faraar rahaa tha, lekin use 2005 main giraftaar kar liya gaya tha
 The trial court in 2008 convicted the three and sentenced them to rigorous life imprisonment

 '' By the way, RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav always targets saints and saints
 lekin, patna main vah ramakatha vaachak morari baapu kaa pravachan sunne pahunche, to hairaan hona swabhaavik he
 During this, Lalu targeted the BJP in gestures and said, 'ram does not mean, but keeps taking the name of Ram
 'patna ke gandhi maidan main sant morari baapu kii ramakatha kaa aayojan kiya gaya tha
 Addressing the closing ceremony of the story of Bapu, the RJD chief said, 'I stay away from saints and saints, but Bapu is something else
 ve asli sant hai
 Lalu expressed his faith in Ram Katha and said, 'ram Kathahi is a story, Ram Katha is a legacy and Morari Bapu is a true saint
 'buree najar se bachaane ke liye morari baapu ne diya kaala gamchhaais dauraan lalu ne apane andaaj main kaha, 'baapu kaala gamchaa isiilie rakhte hai ki kahin kisi kii najar na lage

 baad morari baapu ne unhen bhi ek kaala gamchaa diya or kaha, 'aapako bhi najar na lage
 'the Hindus want to end the anti-hindu tag
 The way Lalbuharhal, Lalu and Nitishne have started to present their presence to the saints and saints in recent times, this is the beginning of a new agenda
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki ye donon netaa ab apane upar lagane vaale 'hindu virdohi tag' ko khatm karnaa chaahate hai
 Perhaps this is the reason that these leaders, who were away from saints and saints till yesterday, are now seen on religious functions and occasions

 This book has become a best seller since it was published
 is maukey par ashutosh rana ne kaha ki apni baat kehane kaa sabase badhiya tarika vyangy hota he kyonki isse samaaj ke vikrut ang ko aise prastut kiya jaataa he jisase use pataa bhi chal jaae or bura bhi nahin lagata
 Talking about his book, Ashutosh Rana said that it is not so much fun to say something directly
 unhone apni kitaab main kuch nijee pahaluon ko bhi ukerne kii koshish kii he
 Magical sentences have also been written in the book, referring to which Ashutosh Rana read many sarcas too
 kaise dur ho badi samasya?unhone kaha ki badi samasya ko khatm karne kaa upaay he ki usase choti samasya ko zyada bada or khatarnaak karke uske saamne khadaa kar dijie, phir badi samasya hamen dikhaai hi nahin degi
 The absence of anything is proof of its non-existence, except God and ghost, it is the formula of wandering
 is laabh he ki aapaki mul samasya jas kii tas bani rahegi or apni suvidha ke anusaar aap baad main iskaa istemaal kar sakate hai

 agar parivaar main koi aapaki kaaryastylee par sawaal khadey kare to aap dadaji ke kaam par sawaal khadey kar dijie, jisase ghar ke 75 fisadi logon kaa dhyaan aapaki kaaryastylee se hat jayega or vah aapaki vifaltaa ke liye dadaji ko jimmedaar va doshi maan lenge
 The voice of the majority is the voice of truth, here this principle will fit because 75 percent people will start to look at you with kindness and you will become the flag bearer of truth
 aise main sach pareshaan ho saktaa he lekin parajeet nahin
 Giving the enemy such a retort, read some excerpts from the book and said that if you have beaten someone in the locality despite a domineering image, then give a befitting reply
 yahaan munhtod kaa matlab munh todane se balki nahin munh se jawaab dene se he
 For this, say the magical sentence that son Jitti tumai is Omar hai uti hamai kamar
 doosraa, itani goli chalihen ki chharra binat-binat karodpati ho jagau
 Third, son Saj ko aao ho, jayo jajo jayo
 vishwaas rakhie shabd main shakti hoti he basharte ve siddat se bole jaaen
 Reading the excerpt from the book Silent Muskan Ki Mara (photo- Chandradeep Kumar)) Ashutosh Rana said that if someone can surround you with questions, do not panic but give emotional turn to his words
 bhaavana wo brahmastra he jo jamini sachai ko hawa main udaakar uske chithde udhed detaa he
 Emotion always rules behavior
 agar aap ghar ke mukhiya hai phir bhi ghar kaa koi vyakti pragati nahin kar paa rahaa he to yaad rakhen ek baar koi vyakti train main baithne ke baad train chodta nahin he
 There is no one in this world who is hopeful of the passengers of the stopped train

 You just keep playing the horn in the middle so that the passengers are excited that now the train is going to run
 sher kaa shikaar, gidad se durirana ne kaha ki agar aap achche shikari ke naam se vikhyath hone par bhi kisi halaat main sher kaa shikaar nahin kar pate to wo pehle gidad ko sher banaakar pratishthit kariye, phir gidad ko sher kii maut maariye
 This saves you the reputation of being the best hunter
 unhen pataa he ki sansar yah dekhakar prabhavit nahin hota ki shikari ne kaise shikaar kiya he balki yah dekhakar prabhavit hota he ki shikari ne kiskaa shikaar kiya
 If you are a lion, do not mess with jackal, it can tarnish your reputation
 saath hi aap sher hai to sher se bhi bilkul mat ulajhie, isse aapaki jaan ko khatra he

 Telling about the psychological truth from his book, Rana said that the stature of a person today is not judged by his friends but by seeing his enemies
 matlab jitna bada aapkaa dushman utane bade aap, isliye apane se chote logon ko apana dushman man banaaiye
 This will make that little man grow up and you will become very small as you grow up
 ashutosh rana kii agali kitaab ram rajya aane vaali he
 Talking about this, Rana said that Rama is involved in our thinking and discussions, as well as he is an unbreakable part of our culture

 Rana said that we have a relationship with new expansion because expansion itself is good
 mitron kii prajatiyanmitron kii shrenee par baat karte hue ashutosh rana ne kaha ki aaj ke takanic daur main mitra kii paribhaasha badal chuki he
 By the way, one who removes the sorrows of the mind is called a friend
 lekin desh, kaal, paristhati ke mutabik mitra kii paribhaasha badal gai he ab jo hamaare praan lele vah hamaara mitra hota he
 Rana said that there are many species of friends like the speed of friends is the cause of our speed, fragility and misery
 baalasakhaa bachapan ke mitra hote hai jinamein se baad main chalakar kuch kaalasakhaa ban jate hai jo aapako kaam siddh hone par doodh kii makkhi kii tarah baahar phenk dete hai
 There is also a friend Palsakha, whose responsibility is to maintain us
 yah aapke dwaara dutkaare jane or bhagaae jane kaa bura nahin maanate, yah maan-apmaan se upar uthe hue hote hai
 a friend is a shield friend, he bears your misdeeds on himself
 aapaki har galati ko yah turant thik karte hai, aap inhen apni mummy kaa vikalp bhi maan sakate hai
 One category is Jalsakha, they do the work of laying nets around you, by which you imagine being free from bondage, but they throw you from one trap to another

 The Central Government on 1 May 2016 passed the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) Act from Parliament to reform the real estate sector
 iske baad 1 may 2017 tak desh ke sabhi rajyon (29 rajya or 7 kendra shashit kshetra) ko is act ke aadhaar par apane liye rera ke niyam nirdhaarit karte hue athurity kaa gathan kar lenaa tha
 But no state in the country met this deadline
 nateeja yah ki kuch apwaad chhodkar puraa desh is kaam ko karne main puri tarah se vifal ho chukaa he
 Why it is important that the RERA Act of the States is passed by the RERA Act to all the states
 aisa isliye jaruri he kyonki samvidhan ke mutabik bhu-varg (land) rajya suchi main he or jameen se judaa koi bhi kanoon athwa niyam rajya sarkaar hi bana sakati he
 Central Government's initiative The Central Government has enacted the RERA Act on the initiative of the Ministry of Housing to decide the responsibility of the builder / developer along with the transparency in the real estate sector
 gauratlab he ki houseing mantralay ne is act ko kendra sarkaar kii 2022 tak sabhi ke liye ghar ke apane flagship project ko teevr gati se aage badhaane ke liye uthaaya tha
 Why is it important that according to the provision of Authority Act, the RERA Authority of the states will act as a regulator for all builders, developers and home buyers
 thik usee tarah jaise share bazaar ke liye sebi or telecom sector ke liye tri karti he
 This authority will have the authority to take important decisions related to the sector and this regulator will also guarantee the security of home buyers from the fraudulent builder, the developer
 is athurity ke gathan ke baad hi real estate sector main transperency ke saath-saath builder / develper kii jimmedaari tay karne kii shuruyaat hogi
 Do states not want transparency? Every single deadline given by the Central Government's Carera Act is passing
 lekin desh ke adhikansh rajyon ne is disha main niyam nirdhaarit kar use notiphoi karaane or athurity banaate hue niamak baitaane kii disha main shuruyaat tak nahin kii he
 However, Madhya Pradesh is an exception state in the entire country, which has taken the lead in this direction
 madhyapradesh ne apane niyamon ko notiphoi karne ke saath-saath athurity ke gathan ke kaam ko puraa kar liya he
 Apart from this, there are some other states which have formed the Interim Authority
 abhitak mahaj 7 rajyon ne apana kanoon notiphoi kiya he
 Exercise to weaken RERA? Experts in this sector believe that if there is further delay in this sector by the states, there is a possibility that the RERA Act, which is aimed at the benefit of the customers, takes a weak form
 darasal is rajyon ke kanoon ban jane or athurity ke gathan ke baad hi desh ke sabhi hisson main rihaayshi or gaiyr rihaayshi projects ko rera act ke tahat register kiya ja sakegaa
 Until this work is not done, customers cannot get the facilities provided under this act
 saath hi is athurity ke gathan ke baad un projects ko bhi 3 maheene ke andar rera act ke tahat registration karana hoga jisase ghar kii kharidari kar chuke logon ko bhi samay se ghar dilaane kii kavayad kii ja sake
 Mehh

 The Supreme Court has upheld the death sentence of Pakistani terrorist Mohammad Ajmal Kasab, convicted of the 26 / 11 terror attack in Mumbai
 kasaab ne is aatanki hamale main use maut kii sajaa diye jane ke vishesh adaalat ke nirnay ko chunauti de thi
 The Supreme Court said, there is strong evidence against Kasab
 adaalat ne mumbai hamale ko desh kii samprabhutaa par hamalaa bataaya or is maamle main kasaab ke khilaaf hoicourt or vishesh adaalat ke faisle ko barkaraar rakhaa
 While delivering the verdict, the court said, "we have no other option but to uphold Kasab's death sentence
" desh ke khilaaf yuddh chhedana kasaab dwaara kiya gaya sabase bada aparaadh he
 The Supreme Court rejected Kasab's plea that his case in the 26 / 11 terror case did not get a fair trial
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki maamle kii sunwaayee se pehle ke charan main sarkaar dwaara kasaab ko vakil muhaiyaa nahin karana maamle main uski sunwaayee ko prabhavit nahin karata
 The court also said that Kasab's confession was voluntary
 is hamale main 166 vyakti maare gaye the
 a division bench of Justice Aftab Alam and Justice Chandramouli Kumar Prasad completed the hearing on Kasab's appeal on 25 April
 nyaayalay ne kasaab kii yachika par kareeb dhai maheene sunwaayee kii or is dauraan aatanki hamale ke silsile main istagasa or bachaav paksh kii daleelon ko suna
 Kasab's death sentence was stayed by the court on October 10 last year
 nyaayalay ne is maamle main 25 varshiya mohammad ajmal kasaab kaa pratinidhitiv karne kii jimmedaari varisht adhivaktaa raju ramchandran ko saunpi thi
 The court will also pronounce an appeal on the appeal of the Maharashtra government challenging the decision to acquit Faheem Ansari and Sabauddin Ahmal from the charge of plotting this terror attack
 nichali adaalat ne sabooton ke abhaav main in donon ko bari kar diya tha or bombai ucch nyaayalay ne is nirnay par apni muhar laga di thi
 During the hearing in the court, it was argued by Kasab that the matter was not heard in an independent and impartial manner
 uskaa yah bhi daawa tha ki vah bharat ke khilaaf yuddh chhedane kii kisi badi sajeesh kaa hissaa nahin tha
 Kasab also argued that the prosecution had failed to prove the charges against him completely beyond doubt
 yahi nahin, uskaa yah bhi aarope tha ki adaalat main sunwaayee ke dauraan paryaapt tareeke se pratinidhitiv ke adhikaar se bhi use vanchit kiya gaya he
 In the petition filed against the decision of the Bombay High Court, Kasab claimed that in the name of 'allah' he was taught to commit this crime like a robot
 uskaa tark he ki uski umr ko dekhte hue use mrityu dand nahin diya janaa chahie
 The High Court in its judgment on 21 February last year confirmed the lower court's May 6, 2010 decision to award death sentence to Kasab
 mambai kii arthur road jail main band mohammad ajmal kasaab ne jail adhikariyon ke jariye yah yachika daayar kii thi

 Karnataka leader and former Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa, who gave the highest number of mps to BJP in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, is all set to return home
 iske liye modi ne apane log tainaat kiye the
 But before this operation could be carried out, the party elder LK Advani vetoed it
 isse modi khemaa naaraaz he or adwani khemaa karpshan free party kii duhai de rahaa he
 According to our affiliate channel Headlines Today, the Modi faction was advocating the return of Yeddyurappa by arguing that it would also bring 10 per cent of his party's KJP votes back to the BJP
 agar aisa hota he to 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bijepi ek baar phir majboot sthit main ho jaaegi
 Significantly, in the 2009 elections, BJP won 18 of the 28 seats in the state
 yah sankhya vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle ghatakar 16 rah gai kyonki do saansad yediurppa ke saath chale gaye
 If the assembly elections are to be considered a measure, it would be a dream for the BJP to go to the double digits here
 ummid bas ek hi he ki yediurppa party main laut aaen, taaki voton kaa bantwaaraa roak congress ke khilaaf chunauti pesh kii ja sake
 Keeping this math in mind, Modi deployed Thawar Chand Gehlot, party general secretary in-charge of Karnataka, for this operation
 unke liye ek plus point yah bhi tha ki yediurppa samarthak anant kumaar or unke god fadar adwani se naaraaz the, bijepi yaa modi se nahin
 Nonetheless, Gehlot succeeded in persuading Yeddyurappa
 gauratlab he ki ab tak yediurppa kii party ke netaa yahi kah rahe the ki vaapasi kaa sawaal nahin, chahen to siton par samjhauta kar sakate hai
 But when everything cleared, Advani came out
 unhone party netaaon ko saaf kar diya ki karpshan ke mudde par samjhauta nahin hoga
 Whether the party suffers loss of seats
 adwani kah rahe hai ki agar yediurppa ko waapas le liya to congress ko karpshan ke mudde par kaise gherenge
 Advani is saying that the party should build an organization on the strength of new faces in Karnataka
 sutron ke mutabik is masale par adwani bhale hi ad rahe hon, magar modi sangh ke aashirwad se aage bad jaaenge or yediurppa kii yah kahkar vaapasi kara di jaaegi ki abhi court ne unhen apradhi siddh nahin kiya he
 Sometimes Rally and sometimes Joshi collided with Amodi and Advani was seen on the issue of Sanjay Joshi
 ye pichley saal kii baat he, jab mumbai main party kaa adhiveshan ho rahaa tha
 Gadkari and the Sangh were preparing that their presidency get another extension
 narendra modi ne nakhre dikhaae or kaha ki jab tak sanjay joshi ko party main itnaa bada plateform miltaa rahegaa, vah nahin aaenge
 Damage control was done in a hurry
 adwani ko kinare kar diya gaya or joshi ko party ke padaadhikari ke pad se mukt kar diya gaya
 Sanjay was Advani's man and descended from the Sangh's nursery
 jab modi paudh the, tab joshi ped ban chuke the
 It was the feud of the Gujarat organization of the nineties
 kaha to yahaan tak jaataa he ki sanjay joshi kaa political kariyar jis sex sidi ke jariye niptaya gaya, usamen bhi bijepi ke netaaon kaa hi haath tha
 However, there is a discussion here between Advani and Modi
 donon ne phir talavaarein khinchin adwani kii jan swabhimaan yatra ke gujarat main root ko lekar
 Advani felt that the kind of welcome and enthusiasm he should have seen in his home state of Gujarat did not happen, because Modi did not touch the party
 donon kii pichhali kalah to duniya ne dekhi
 When Modi's leadership in Goa was stamped, Advani sat in the Kop Bhavan
 istipha dene kaa hath yoga bhi kar liya
 But now it seems that the party is ready to move ahead with their taunts and tantrums
 kyonki aisa nahin kiya gaya to modi plan main palitha lag jayega
 Part of the same plan is the return of Yeddyurappa, who had to step down as Chief Minister in July 2011 following the Lokayukta report
 un par avaidh khanan mafia ko sangrakshan dene ke aarope lage the
 In December 2012, Yeddyurappa parted ways after the party was accused of neglect
 phir unhone karnataka janata paksh yani kegepi kaa gathan kiya
 After that, the BJP lost badly in the state assembly elections
 kegepi ko sirf 6 siten milin, magar iskaa vot share 10 fisadi tha
 BJP is eyeing this

 (from input language) Appalled and shocked to read about yet another tragic rape and murder!i don't think India is safe anymore for women # justiceforjisha The Delhi High Court has asked the Delhi Police's stand on the parole petition of Manu Sharma, who is serving life imprisonment in Tihar Jail in the 1999 murder of model Jessica Lal

 He has filed a petition to attend his brother's wedding and other ceremonies between 10 and 21 November
 adaalat ne sharma ke purv aacharan kaa zikr karte hue uske parole ke anurodh par police se rukh poocha he or kaha ki vah pehle bhi parole kii sharton kaa ulanghan karte hue discothek jaataa rahaa he
 Sharma's counsel, however, argued that only the conduct of the last one year should be considered as per the parole granting guidelines
 iske baad peeth ne notice jari kiya
 Under parole, a convict is temporarily released from jail before completion of his sentence for which there are certain conditions
 peeth ne kaha, ‘apilkarta (sharma) ke vakil kaa kahana he ki dishanirdeshon ke anusaar parole ke liye keval pichley ek saal ke vyavhaar ko dekhne kii jarurat he
 The brother of the petitioner is getting married on 21 November and the ceremonies related to it will start from 10 November

 But the reason for parole remained unfounded as Sharma's grandmother died in 2008
 parole kii avadhi duusari baar 30 din or badhaane ke dauraan sharma ko discothek main partiyon main bhaag lete dekha gaya
 She had also cited the cause of her mother's illness for parole but she was seen in a media briefing to promote the women's cricket tournament at a Sharma family hotel in Chandigarh
 parole kii sharton ke ulanghan kii baat saamne aane ke baad sharma ko parole kii avadhi samaapt hone se pehle hi jail adhikariyon ke samaksh samarpan karnaa padaa

 asaram ke bete narayan sai ne apane ird-gird namakaran kaa ek aisa chakravyuuh bana rakhaa tha, jisamen funs kar naa jane kitni hi ladkiyaan gumnaam ho gayi
 Rajadar Ganga of Narayan Sai has told the police that Sai used to change the name of every girl in his ashram, on whom he had bad intentions
 yahaan tak ki ganga or uski bahan jamuna kaa naam bhi usee ne rakhaa tha

 Surat Police Commissioner Saheb Rakesh Asthana says that Narayan Sai has a son from Ganga's sister Jamuna
 police ko ye jaankaree ganga se mili he
 However, the police is now confirming this information
 aapako bataa den ki narayan sai pehle se shaadishuda he or uski patni janaki indore main rahati he
 However, he too has been mysteriously missing since the arrival of Sai
 ganga ne bataaya he ki ashram main yon shoshan kaa khel khilne ke liye hi narayan sai apane pita asaram kii tarah vahaan aanevaali har ladki kaa naam badal diya karata tha or to or narayan sai ne khud apni patni shilpi kaa naam badal kar bhi janaki rakh diya tha
 Similarly, the real name of Ganga herself and her sister Jamuna is also not Ganga and Jamuna
 ganga kaa asli naam dharmishtha he, jabaki jamuna kaa asli naam bhaavana patel he par ashram aane ke baad donon bahanon kaa naam ganga or jamuna narayan sai ne khud rakhe the
 The motive behind this was to confuse the people, so that people would be entangled only on the question of the name of the opposing girl or when the pole was opened
 police kii maane to dharmishtha urf ganga ke saath milakar jamuna bhi ladakiyon ko fans kar narayaan sai ke paas pesh karne main hameshaa shaamil rahi or yahi vajah he ki ab jamuna ko bhi usee utani hi teji se talash rahi he, jis teji se wo narayan sai ko dhundh rahi he

 "that part was really basic and basic things are successful," says Kamra at her home in Mumbai

 His Twitter timeline is a platform to shame the BJP and Congress

 "I don't think any of my work has been successful so far
 " bhale hi utyub par unke 8,40,000 sabsakribar hon or unki ulatbansiyaan lagaataar stream ho rahi hon

 "its true

 maharashtra ke lok nirmaan mantri chagan bhujabal ko nesanalist congress party (ensipi) main sheersh par kaayam rahane kii jang kaa khamiyaja bhugatna pad rahaa he
 State Home Minister R
 aar
 Patil has allowed the anti-corruption Bureau (ACB) to investigate allegations of taking bribe by BJP leader Kirit Somaiya against Bhujbal
 somaiya ne aarope lagaaya he ki nai dilli main banane vaale rajya ke guest house maharashtra sadan kaa theka dene main bhujabal ne apane pad kaa durupyog kar rajya ko 10,000 karod ru
 Has lime yah theka 2006 main ke
 s
 chamanakar and company ko diya gaya tha or iske tahat dilli ke lutiuns jone main sthit kasturba gandhi maarg par chah acre jameen main ek vishaal gust house kaa nirmaan hua
 Somaiya alleged that Chamankar had entrusted the responsibility of supplying furniture to the new guest house to Bhujbal's daughter-in-law Shefali and Visakha's company Idin Furniture
 saaf he ki bhujabal ke peedblyoody vibhaag ne chamanakar ko mumbai ke posh ilaake andheri main ek mahatvapurn plot diya tha jisaki evaj main chamanakar ne muft main maharashtra sadan banane or mumbai ke malabar hill sthit hai mount guest house kii marammat karnaa manjuur kar liya tha
 Somaiya says that Chamankar spent just 150 crores on this project
 kharch kiye hai jabaki ve andheri ke 'uphaar' main mili plot par residential or commercial complex banaakar 10,000 karod ru
 Can earn
 somaiya kaa kahana he, ''andheri main residential jameen kii keemat 20,000 ru
 Per square foot, while the cost of commercial space is Rs 50,000
 prati varg foot
 Chamankar got plot 4
 5 lakh varg foot he
 Thus they sell it for Rs 10,000 crore
 kama sakate hai
 "bhujbal denies these allegations outright
" unka kahana he, ''vilasarav deshmukh ke kaarykaal ke dauraan hi teen mantriyon ke samooh ne chamanakar ko yah theka diya tha
 So how did i misuse my position? Allow ACB to check
 mujhe puraa yakeen he ki sachai saamne aa jaaegi
 Patil's promptness in allowing the ACB to initiate this investigation has raised many eyebrows
 bhaunhen tanne kii vajah yah he ki ensipi ke medical ajukeshan mantri vijay kumaar gavit ke khilaaf isi tarah ke jaanch ke ek anurodh ko unhone do saal se latakaakar rakhaa hua he
 Patil clarifies that he has not given permission to the ACB to investigate but it is at his own discretion to decide
 haalanki mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan ne bayaan diya he, ''iske liye grih mantri se manjuuri aani chahie'' or file unke paas nahin ai thi
 From this it seems that Patil has a full hand in this
 ensipi ke sutara bataate hai ki asal main patil up-mukhyamantri ajit pavaar kaa ek tarah se ehsaan chukaa rahe hai jo 11 agast kii aaazaad maidan hinsa ke baad unke bachaav main aage aae the
 It was due to Pawar's support that Patil was able to save his chair
 sutara ne kaha, ''ab mauka patil ke haath main he
 "everyone knows that Pawar and Bhujbal do not like each other with puffy eyes
" up-mukhyamantri party ke varisht netaa bhujabal ko apane agle mukhyamantri banane kii raah kaa roda maanate hai
 a supporter of Patil, on the condition of anonymity, claims that this decision of the Home Minister will actually benefit Bhujbal as the acb's record in the investigation case is poor
 pichley das saal main vah sirf 10 logon ke khilaaf hi dosha siddh kar saki he
 He has also not been given any time frame to conclude his investigation
 unhone kaha, ''asibi ko jaanch kii ijaajat dekar asal main patil ne bhujabal ke palatwaar kaa jokhim le liya he
 The Patil supporter referred to the affidavit of the Economic Offenses Wing (IOW) of the Mumbai Police controlled by Patil in the Bombay High Court in July
 isamen eodblyoo ne kaha ki bhujabal kii aguwai vaale mumbai ajukeshan trust (emiti) ke fund yaa property ke durupyog ke aarope par bhujabal or unke parivaar ke khilaaf sangyeya aparaadh kaa maamla nahin banataa
 MET trustee Sunil Karve had complained that Shefali and Vishakha were using one floor of the trust's eight-storey building as their furniture showroom without paying rent for the last eight years
 is tarah unhone 117 karod ru
 Is harmed
 ho saktaa he bhagya ek baar phir bhujabal kaa saath de
 The NCP source says that Patil is actually paying tribute to Ajit Pawar who came to his rescue after the Azad Maidan violence

 Northern Ireland writer Anna Burnsko has been awarded the 2018 Kamen Booker Prize
 unhen unki kitaab 'milcoman' ke liye yah sammaan diya gaya he
 With this announcement, Ana Burns became the first Northern Irish writer
 bataa den ki unki yah teesri kitaab thi
 The book 'milkman' written by Burns is the story of a woman's affair with a married man
 saath hi yah mahila ek aise shaks kaa saamana kar rahi thi, jo yon utpeedan ke liye paariwarik rishton, saamaajik dabaav or raajnneetik nishtha jaise hathiyaaron kaa istemaal kar rahaa tha
 George Saunders received the 2017 Man Booker prizeburns will be given £ 50,000 along with this award
 burns kii kitaab ko lekar jajon ne kaha ki milcoman adbhut kitaab he
 He also said that in this book, the pain of that girl has been made very well

 The award of the year 2008 was given to Indian writer Arvind Adiga

 Arvind Kejriwal has emerged as the biggest hero of alternative politics after the election results of four states
 congress or bijepi ke dabadabe vaali dilli kii raajnneeti main unki aam aadmi party ne 27 siton par jeet darj karke dikhaa diya he ki dil or daulat kii ladaai main dil kaa palada aaj bhi baari he
 The celebration of this victory was also a different type of procession
 satta ke ahankaar ke kilaaf aatma kii azaadi kii aahaten anhad aasmaan se takaraa rahi hai
 Breaths of breath changed all the lessons of politics, the authors of the prologues of hypocrisy remained venerated, the frames of family sovereignty, and Avam wrote a magazine of faith on the hills of Aravali
 ye sirf ek aadmi kii us zid kaa jaaya he ki garibi amiri ke utsav kaa naam nahin he
 This is the redness of the ardor who dreams of snatching the light from the setting sun
 ye un tamannaaon kii tadap kii taarikh he jo jise samay kii salawaton ne salaam bheja he
 It is a reflection of the harsh discipline against the politics of grace which the world calls Kejriwal
 badlaav, siyasat or utsavdekhate hi dekhte dilli vishwaas ke viraat utsav main badal gai
 a thought parallel to power and politics took such an incredible shape that the self-styled king of democracy was strangled in three hours
 ye ek fakir kaa aisa fasaana he ki fareb kii pudiya bechney vaale apane-apane sheesh mehalon ke qaidi ban gaye hai
 The idols of Kejriwal's bravery and sobriety, which proclaim the election against Sheila Dixit, have disappeared from the space of the masses
 mazaduron or mehanatakashon ne milakar kejariwal ke saath ek nai parampara kaa adhyay likhaa he
 Delhi has written this chapter of faith in fresh ink
 chehre ke chamatkaar kii choukhat chuumate chaarnon ko janata ne apni zindagi se baahar kar diya he
 The fate of India's destiny is blown away by the sound of the future
 us duniya ke naam is duniya kaa sandesh bahut saaf he
 Now the cleaning has started under the creases
 boliyon ke baitalon ko badalanaa hi hoga varna samay unke kadamon ke neeche se buniyaad khinch legaa
 Well, the government will not form the Aam Aadmi Party, but politics is not just the name of the government
 siyasat to sapane ke us beej kaa naam he jisapar soch main badlaav ke phool lagate hai
 Babu, who is not a hat-trick of hat-trick popularity of power, has also sent a message to the rite of the market which is confused that vote is a commodity and every commodity is bought
 dilli ne desh ko soch kaa ek nayaa sansar bhi diya he or aadhaar bhi
 Kejriwal alone has enveloped the illusion that the hat-trick of power is the ultimate measure of one's popularity
 vikaas kii laffaaziyon ko janata ne kaarij kar diya he
 The verdict is clear, learn how to speak the politics truth in time
 ise koi shor samajhane kii gustaakhee na kare
 From Jantar Mantar, between the Ramlila Maidan and the triangle of assembly, a world of understanding has arisen which has drawn the voice from the tongue of emperors who considered power as power
 sari paribhaashaayen ab nae sire se tay hongi
 Traditions will be decided afresh raajnneeti ke raja sakate main hai
 The doors of the democracy door are bursting with the worker's beat charchaa main 'aap' lekin
 
 
 The election results in Delhi have come out according to the possibilities
 rajdhani main charchaa haalanki aam aadmi party kii jarur he lekin ye bhi bada sach he ki sabase badi party bharatiya janata party hi bani he
 The truth is also that BJP is the closest to forming a government
 yahi vajah he ki jashn camel ke kaaryakarta or netaa bhi manaa rahe hai
 Even though the Aam Aadmi Party has surprised all political stalwarts and analysts in Delhi, the BJP has emerged as the single largest party in the capital
 aise main camel ke khilne kaa jashn camel kii bagiya ke bagbaan to manaanege hi
 Be the bjp's headquarters in Delhi
 mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar harshavardhan kaa ghar ho
 Whether it is the residence of former party president Nitin Gadkari or the party office
 bijepi ke netaa or kaaryakarta milakar dilli main phir se siyaasi vaapasi kaa jashn manaa rahe hai
 The joy of being the closest to power is coming out of these pictures
 haalanki bijepi ko aam aadmi party se kadi takkar mili he, lekin saath main dilasa is baat kaa he ki 15 saalon se satta par kabiz congress kii sarkaar ko unhone ukhaad phenkaa he
 Even though the BJP has stopped coming a short distance with the necessary majority to form the government, but the BJP claims that the next government will form the same
 sarkaar ke liye jodtod main bhale hi kuch ghanton kaa vakt lag jaae, lekin philhal party ke liye mauka jashn kaa manaane kaa he

 telecom regulatory athurity of india (TRAI) ne aaj mobile interknection yuses charge (IUC) ko 14 paise se ghataakar 6 paise prati minute kar diya
 If mobile companies give benefit of this cut to customers, then the way of reducing call rates can be opened
 niamak ke is kadam kaa phayda nai company reliance jeeyo ko milane kii ummid he
 On the other hand, the mobile companies' organization COAI has termed this decision as wrong and said that the court can be approached against it
 gauralatab he ki IUC vah charge hota he jo koi doorsanchaar company apane network se duusari company ke network par mobile kol ke liye duusari company ko detii he
 TRAI has stated that the new call termination charge of 6 paise per minute will be effective from 1 October 2017 and will be completely abolished from 1 January 2020
 tri ne apane bayaan main kaha he ki usne yah faisla bhagidaaron se mili raay ke aadhaar par kiya he
 In its response, COAI Director General Rajan Mathews said, this is a disastrous move
 
 
 zyaadaatar sadsy companiyon ne sanket diya he ki ve sambhavat: is maamle main raahat ke liye adaalat kii raah lengi
 Former TRAI chairman Rahul Khullar has also agreed with Mathews' views
 unhone kaha, agar aap termination shulk ghataaenge to mukhya rup se jeeyo ko hi laabh hoga kyonki vahi anya network par baari trephic bojha daal rahi he
 Significantly, there has been a lot of controversy recently about the IUC and today's decision to cut it is contrary to the stance of major telecom companies like Bharti Airtel, which was seeking to increase it
 bharti airtel is mudde par IUC charge ko kam karne kii maang karne valirelliance jiyoke saath vivaad main bhi fansi he
 In another step, TRAI has today issued a consultation paper to promote trade facilitation in the telecom sector

 ve kushal anupaalan ke kaayal hai, jo chizon ko sahaj banane or kaarobaar main teji laane kii prakriyaaon par kendrit he
 It may also be noted that despite Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan's objection to rigid monetary controls, Modi allowed it to remain the same and assured that basic economic management should remain solid, inflation remained low, rupee remained stable And the current account and financial deficit target should be met
 unhone yah bhi aashwast kiya he ki kaarobaaron ko sahaj banane or kisaanon ke liye infrastracchar kii funding paryaapt se zyada maatra main bani rahe
 Be it railways, highways, ports, power plants or petroleum
 in tamaam kshetron ko fund kii paryaapt khuraaq mili he or modi nijee taur par inaki pragati par nigaah rakhe hue hai
 It is not surprising that his ministers Arun Jaitley, Nitin Gadkari, Suresh Prabhu, Dharmendra Pradhan and Piyush Goyal have been rated highly by the India Today team in terms of their performance in the economic and infrastructure sectors
 aane vaale varshon main abhi kul milakar bahut kuch kiya janaa shesh he, lekin arthvyavastha ke kushal prabandhan ke liye modi zyada ankon ke hakdaar hai
 Modi had little experience in foreign policy, but he has done a surprising job and has shown results
 gharelu vikaas ko badhaava dene ke liye unhone videsh niti kaa kushaltapurvak dohan kiya he
 Foreign Secretary S
 jaishankar modi kii lagaataar ho rahi videsh yatraaon kii tulana japan ke mashhoor netaa tomomi ivakura ke saath karte hai, jo apane raaj ke shuruaati do saalon main udyogon, sansthaanon or sarvshereshth kaarypaddatiyon ke adhyayan ke liye videsh jaaya karte the or jinhone 19veen sadi main meiji kii bahaali ke baad japan ke aadhunikeekaran main us gyaan kaa istemaal kiya
 Modi is not only giving a new boost to the country's image by taking untold trips to countries around the world, but is also working diligently to sell India as an attractive investment destination
 unhone 2014-15 main 12 deshon kii yatra kii jisase 20 arab dollar ke pratyaksh videshi nivesh kaa aashwaasan unke haath laga
 Jaishankar compares Modi's concentration on foreign policy to Jawaharlal Nehru, who took active help from other countries in laying the economic foundation of India
 is muhim main padosiyon ko sarvopari rakhane kaa najariya bhale hi pakistan main jaakar atak gaya ho, lekin bangladesh ke saath aitihaasik bhoomi hastantaran seemaa samjhauta karke unhone sambandh ko majboot kiya he, bhutan or myanmar ke saath rishte sudhaare hai tathaa afghanistan or maldive main rishton kii khoi hui jameen phir se hasil kii he
 In Pakistan's case, even though he has been accused of taking a U-turn many times, he remains committed to building a good relationship with Islamabad, provided he keeps his domestic terror factories at bay
 samasya yah he ki pakistan main pradhanmantri navaj sharif kii ab pakistani fouj ke saamne utani chal nahin rahi he or faujee hukmran bharat ke saath achche rishte kabhi nahin chaahate hai
 Modi has achieved considerable success in energy-rich West Asia and Central Asia
 vahaan ateet main bharat kaa rasookh kam hi rahaa he
 After many ups and downs with China among the major forces, a balance has been established, economic alliances with Russia have strengthened and Modi has established a friendly friendship with US President Barack Obama
 iskaa ek pratikul paksh yah he ki tamaam purv pradhanmantriyon ne apane kaarykaal ke aarambhik do varshon main hi bade aarthik sudhaaron yaa nitigat badlaavon kii ghoshnaa kar daali thi, chaahe vah pi
 V
 narsingh raav kii udaarikaran kii niti rahi ho, atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa pokaran-2 parmaanu pareekshan yaa phir manmohan singh dwaara kiya gaya america-bharat parmaanu sauda
 Modi has undoubtedly made a pact with the initial pace by not adopting this recipe
 arthvyavastha, infrastracchar or videsh niti ke maamle main modi sarkaar kaa pradarshan jahaan awwal he, vahiin uskaa kul pradarshan do ahm morchon ke kaaran kamjor padataa dikhataa haih saamaajik or rajnatik
 Modi's political tendencies are very subtle
 inhen ke chalate ve akele apane dam par 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main apni party ko jabardast janadesh tak le aae the, lekin satta main aane ke baad aisa kai maukon par laga he ki ve jaan-boojhkar shuturamurg ban gaye hai
 He kept a long silence on many divisive issues
 congress mukt bharat ke apane lakshya kii sanak main bijepi ne sansad ko takreeban niskriy kar daalaa he or baaki vipaksh ko bhi apane saath lekar chalane main unki koi ruchi nahin dikhti
 As a result, important bills like GST including land acquisition are licking the dust
 yahi nahin, gaiyr-bijepi rajyon main unki party kii sakriyata bhi lagaataar maahaul main garmi ghol rahi he
 During this time Modi is only engaged in attacking the nehru-gandhi family
 unki nijee lokapriyata chaahe ab bhi kaayam ho or vajan ke maamle main ve bijepi ke kisi bhi duusare netaa par baari hon, lekin bihar or dilli main hui chunavi haar ne unki aparajeyata ke gubaare main chhed karke aisi hawa nikaali he ki rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke dabaav ke aage ve zyada nirih ho gaye hai
 His declining ability to deliver results in state elections has given some extremist elements within the Sangh an opportunity to divert attention from Modi's development agenda
 ho saktaa he ki ve aise sanghee tatwon ke bare main churchill kii tarah sochate hon, jo kehete the ki ''raste main padane vaale har bhunkate kute par pathar maarane kii sochoge to apni manzil tak kabhi nahin pahunch paaoge,'' lekin kuch maukey beshak aae the, jab unhen aise tatwon par nirnaayak rup se lagaam kasni chahie thi taaki baaki ke liye vah nazeer ban sake
 Instead, he allowed the Sangh and BJP to fly away on divisive issues like patriotism and beef ban in the hope that it would polarize votes
 laalkrishna adwani nabbe ke dashak main hi aisi khuraphaton kii seemaa ko pahchaan chuke the
 If Modi does not learn this lesson soon, then his goal of Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat will remain as a hollow jumla
 india today samooche kaamkaaj ke liye modi ko rajat padak detaa he, lekin swarna padak paane ke liye unhen un kshetron ko shashakt karnaa hoga, jahaan unhen jatke lage hai or un dikkaton ko hal karnaa hoga, jo unki raah roak rahi hai
 It is clear that economy, development and social welfare should be their priorities
 jaaton se lekar patidaaron tak badhata asantosh, rohit vemula kii khudakushi se lekar kanhaiya kumaar kii giraftaar tak faile samooche ghatnakram se paidaa hui daraar is baat kaa sanket he ki saamaajik vikaas ke abhaav or badhati berogari ke kaaran logon main aakrosh badhata ja rahaa he
 The rapid implementation of schemes and programs that Modi has taken, he needs to focus on
 itane vishaal desh kii udhyamshiltaa kii kshamta kaa dohan karne ke liye shuru kii gai start ap india jaisi yojanaon ko agar kaamyaab hona he to unhen samay se har tarah ke sansthagat samarthan kii darkaar hogi
 Along with declaring goals and programs, Modi will also have to clearly decide what his government hopes to achieve
 unhen yah bhi tay karnaa chahie ki aakhir jamini str par ye kaise utrenge or logon ko unase vaastavik raahat kab tak mil sakegi
 They have to work from a more inclusive perspective, where the poor and the market are seen as mutually supportive, not as opposed to each other
 ek aisa aarthik udaarvaad, jo vikaas or garibon kii ek saath seva kar saktaa ho, bharat ko usee kii darkaar he
 This shows that the country is now moving ahead of the Congress policy of distributing revolutions, where people will get employment and a sense of self-respect will arise within an average citizen
 kuch ahm mantralayon kaa netritv deele-dhaale haathon main he or modi ko unhen kah dena chahie ki yaa to ve apni chaal durust kar len yaa phir unhen hataa hi diya jaae
 Modi's work becomes easier because this country is still assuming that he has answers to serious questions of the country
 isamen shaq kii koi gunjaaish nahin he
 Modi's performance in the third year will be the same, it will form the foundation for his second term

 According to news agency PTI, Singh said that Jinnah's photograph in Aligarh Muslim University and not to remove it despite the demand is a result of weak Hindutva and also said that there is no Hindu dominance in this university, so there Jinnah's picture is still hanging unhone kaha ki rajnatik durbalata ke kaaran paak parast takaton ke viruddh samuchit karrwai nahin ho paa rahi he
 In states where the BJP is in government, Pakistan's supporting powers are getting weaker
 singh ne aarope lagaaya ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee sareekhe rajaneta khuleam raashtra virdohi takaton ke saath khadey hai
 He also demanded the resignation of the Kabina minister of Uttar Pradesh, Swami Prasad Maurya, on morality, who allegedly referred to Jinnah as a good personality
 bairiya kshetra se vidhayak singh ne kaha ki agar jinna maury ke adarsh hai to unhen yogi mantrimandal se tatkaal naitikta ke aadhaar par istipha de dena chahie
 Jinnah can be a great man in the eyes of Maurya, not in the eyes of any patriot
 yah puche jane par ki jinna ko shakhsiyat qaraar dene ke baad bhi maury kaise yogi sarkaar main mantri bane hue hai, vidhayak ne kaha ki kaante se hi kanta ko nikaala jaataa he
 Now the time has come that even small forks should be thrown out

 Ram Manohar Lohia was born on 23 March 1910 in Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh

 desh main gaiyr-congresavad kii alakh jagaane vaale mahaan swatantraaa senaanee or samaajawaadee netaa ram manohar lohia chaahate the ki duniyabar ke socialist ekajute hokar majboot manch banaae
 Lohia was a craftsman of non-congressism in Indian politics and due to his untiring efforts, the Congress suffered defeat in many states in the year 1967, although the Congress at the center was able to retain some power
 haalanki lohia 1967 main hi chal based, lekin unhone gaiyr congresavad kii jo vichaardhaara chalaai
 Because of this, in 1977, for the first time, a non-congress government was formed at the Center
 lohia maanate the ki adhik samay tak satta main rahakar congress adhinayakawadi ho gayi thi or vah uske khilaaf sangharsh karte rahe
 Ram Manohar Lohia was young at the time of independence and was watching very closely the events of independence and partition of the country
 unki ek kitaab ke anusaar lohia ne aazaadee ke aath mukhya kaaran ginaae the
 This includes British treachery, the Congress leadership's ups and downs, the direct circumstances of hindu-muslim riots, lack of perseverance and power in the public, Gandhi's non-violence, Muslim League diplomacy, inability to take advantage of opportunities and Hindu arrogance

 Actually Lohia knew very well that in politics it is necessary to eliminate the root before eliminating the opponent
 is chunaav main congress ke paas sansaadhan adhik the, lekin phir bhi lohia nehru ke saamne jamkar lade
 In this election, Nehru lagged behind in those areas where Lohia addressed the election meeting
 bharat chodo andolan main bhi sakriy-gandhi ji or anya congressi netaaon ke giraftaar hone jane ke baad lohia ne bhumigat rahakar 'bharat chodo andolan' ko puure desh main failaayaa
 The Central Governing Board was formed of leaders such as Lohia, Achyut Patwardhan, Sadiq Ali, Purushottam Tikaram Das, Mohanlal Saxena, Ramanandan Mishra, and was tasked to formulate policy and give views on Lohia
 20 may 1944 ko lohia ji ko bombai main giraftaar kar liya gaya
 After his arrest, he was kept in a dark cell in Lahore Fort where Bhagat Singh was hanged 14 years ago
 isi ke saath hi unhone lagaataar swatantraaa kii aag ko lagaataar jalaae rakhane kaa kaam kiya
 On 30 September 1967, Lohia was admitted for operation at the Willingdon Hospital, ie Lohia Hospital in New Delhi, where he died on 12 October 1967 at the age of 57

 This tantric named Dhoom Dada Dhoom robbed the businessman in the name of offering fragrance
 gujarat ke junagarh main ambika jewalers ke maalik kiritbhai ne tantric kii baton main aakar apane teen ghar, teen car, dukaan or sone-chaandi ke gahanon ke saath ghar kii sabhi mahilaon ke gahane bhi bech die
 Not only this, he kept giving it to the tantrik by borrowing money from the relatives of his identity
 aaj se dedh saal pehle kiritbhai kii dukaan par javidbhai mirza naam kaa ek shaks graahak banakar aayaa
 He had taken away his old jewels, carrying new jewels
 isamen vah saadhe 9 lakh kii udhari karke gaya tha
 The Kirit brothers used to call Javidbhai again and again for money
 ek din javidbhai dukaan par aae or paise dilwane ke naam par bholaa baapu bukhari ke paas le gaye jise log dhooma dada dhooma bukhari ke naam se jaanate the
 There Bukhari said that within a few days you will get money
 kiritbhai jitani bhi baar paise lene ke liye jate, vah khooshbu chadhaane ke naam se tantric puja vidhi ke naam par lakhon rupye letaa rahaa
 When the money was not returned, the tantric went to Kiritbhai's house
 vahaan ek bag or ek potli taiyaar karwaai or bedroom main rakhwa di
 The tantrik assured Kiritbhai that after two days the money will be returned to you
 kiritbhai ne do din baad bag or potli kholi to vah khaali nikle
 When he reached Dhoom Dada Dhoom Bukhari, he was missing from there
 kiritbhai ko laga ki unke saath bahut badi dhokhadhadi ho gai he
 When the entire contract was done, it was found that the entire Rs 4 crore went in the name of Tantric law
 kiritbhai ne police main tantric ke khilaaf shikaayat darj karai
 After this fraud the police are looking for this tantrik
 saath hi ye bhi jaanch karne main juty he ki kiritbhai ke alaava duusare kitne log is tantric kaa shikaar hue hai
 In Seoni, Madhya Pradesh, Independent MLA Dinesh Rai wiped off the pallu of the former woman mp's sari on the dais
 is video ke saamne aane ke baad bavaal hua, to nirdaleey vidhayak ko safai deni padi
 The MLA says that former MP Nita Pateria is like her sister-in-law, so she joked
 vahiin pateria kaa kahana he ki is maamle main jo karrwai kerani hogi, vah party tay karegi
 In fact, on the occasion of the launch of the crop insurance scheme for farmers, Dinesh Rai's hand was wet with oil in order to light the lamp, after which he wiped his hand with the pallu of Nita Pateria's saree
 haath ponchney ke baad vidhayak ne mudde ko halkaa sabit karne kii koshish karte hue ise majaak bataaya
 When pictures of the incident began to appear on local TV channels, the distraught Dinesh Rai allegedly phoned Pateria twice and apologized and said it was a joke
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, vah meri bhabhi jaisi hai, or maine sirf majaak main aisa kiya
 Pateria, a 51-year-old former MP, had earlier laughed off the incident and said that the mla's behavior was like a child being treated by his mother, but after the news was shown on TV channels, he said that in this case Joe Action has to be taken, that will be done by his party BJP
 23 may ke baad centre main kisi bhi dal kii sarkaar bane, uske liye sabase badi chunauti paryaapt sankhya main rojgaar srijan karne kii hogi
 Focus on employment Given these figures, it is very important that 1 every year in the country
 28 karod nae log naukari kii talash main aa jate hai
 Apart from this, every year about 9 million people leave their villages and towns to leave agriculture and work in other sectors
 koi sarkari aankada abhi nahin aayaa he, lekin haal main media main li eneseso kii vah periodic lebar force survey (PLFS) report kaaphi charchaa main rahi jisamen kaha gaya ki 2017-18 main berogari kii dar 6
 Reached 1 percent, the highest in 45 years
 pichley varshon main aae lagbhag sabhi chunavi survey main logon kii sabase badi chintaa berogari ko bataaya gaya he
 What are the challenges? Many things are clear in the PLFS report of NSSO - There has been a sharp rise in the open unemployment rate
 yah saal 2011-12 ke 2
 6 in 2017-18 as against 2 per cent
 1 fisadi tak pahunch gai he
 Meanwhile around 4
 7 karod log berozegaar hue hai
 This is more than half of the total working population (15 to 60 years)
 yah haal tab he jab in sabhi varshon main jidipi main 7 fisadi kii tej badhat hui he
 So from both the Economic Survey 2014-15 and Azim Premji University study, it is clear that India's GDP growth is jobless, that is, at least jobs are being created
 70 or 80 ke dashak main jab jidipi main growth rate 3- 4 fisadi tha, tab rojgaar main badhat 2 fisadi ho rahi thi, lekin ab jidipi growth 7 fisadi ke kareeb ho jane ke baad bhi rojgaar main badhat 1 fisadi yaa usase bhi kam he
 Bhanumurthy, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), says that now less employment generation production activities will have to focus on the sector generating more employment
 vitt mantralay kii march 2019 kii manthali iconomic report (MER) ke mutabik vaastavik jidipi 2016-17 ke 8
 It has come down from 2 per cent to 7 per cent in 2018-19
 iskaa matlab he ki sabase pehle phir se jidipi growth rate ko tej karne kii jarurat he, kyonki uske bina rojgaar srijan kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Focus area has to be identified, therefore the first focus of the new government should be on economic growth
 sarkari aankadon ko dekhne se pataa chalata he ki bharat kii jidipi growth pichley kuch varshon main gharelu khapat or sarkari kharchon par nirbhar rahi he, kyonki growth ke do anya ingine nijee nivesh or niryaat main badhat nahin ho paa rahi
 Now even domestic consumption is not increasing
 aisi halaat main ekmaatr sahaara sarkari kharchon ko badhanaa hi he jo saal 2016-17 main jidipi ke 1
 1 in 2018-19 7 fisadi hi rah gaya he
 For this economic activity will have to increase, demand will have to be created in the economy and private investment will have to be attracted
 to nai sarkaar ko jahaan saarvajanik kharch badhanaa hoga, vahiin yah bhi jaruri he ki yah kharch gahan shram vaale kshetron par zyada ho taaki zyada se zyada rojgaar paidaa ho
 Talking about agriculture, it can be in irrigation, cold storage, etc
 Apart from this, it can happen in the expansion of MNREGA, rural health and education infrastructure, roads etc
 ab shram pradhan kai gaiyr krishi sector main naukariyon kaa paryaapt srijan nahin ho paa rahaa
 Now sectors like health and education have become the most employment-generating sectors
 haal kii ek study ke mutabik shiksha, transport or anya jan sevaayen, hospitality jaise saamaajik kshetron main naukari srijan kii paryaapt sambhaavnaaen hai
 Apart from this, there is good potential for job creation in emerging fields like robotics, artificial intelligence, 3D printing, big data analysis, cloud technology
 rashtriya rojgaar niti kii tatkaal jaruratmodi sarkaar kii do mahatvakankshi yojanaayen ‘skill india’ or ‘mek in india’ rojgaar ke kshetra main koi sanrachanaatmak badlaav karne or paryaapt rojgaar srijan karne main vifal raheen
 The saddest part is that an attempt was made to deny that there is a problem and no initiative was taken to overcome it
 samasya kii vikaraalata ko bataate hue rojgaar ke halaat par azim premaji uniwarsity ke adhyayan main kaha gaya he, ‘ek rashtriya rojgaar niti par vyapak taur par vichaar karne kii tatkaal jarurat he
 'this policy will have to take care of data shortfalls, wage subsidies, incentives for skilled labor, successful employment policies at the state level, financial scope, etc
 and future action plans will have to be set

 metro train dilli kii shaan se zyada jaan he
 Everyday it takes millions of people to their destination
 lekin dilli metro main aapaki privesi khatre main bhi pad sakati he
 Here, many pornographic sms were made from the CCTV cameras installed for security, which were uploaded on porn sites
 desh kii rajdhani dilli kii jindagi badal di metro ne
 If the Delhi air conditioner boarded the metro train after the bus hit, then the developmental heights became included in its mood
 metro dilli kii life-line ban gai
 But from this life line, such pictures were filtered out, which embarrassed the metro
 jisane desh kii rajdhani main shaan kii sawari dene vaali dilli metro par ek badnuma daag laga diya he
 The question arises that
 
 
 kya metro main lage sisitivi camere se ashleel tasviren utaari ja rahi hai?kya un ashleel tasveeron ko ms kii shakl di ja rahi he?or kya un ashleel ms ko porn cites par daalaa ja rahaa he?in saare sawaalon ke jawaab metro kii sawari karne waalon ko jhakzor dene ke liye kaaphi hai
 These questions are also raising serious questions on those monitoring CCTV cameras
 aisa isliye ki metro trainon or steshnon main qaid hui ladke-ladakiyon kii aapattijanak tasviren, ms kii shakl main duniya ke saamne kaise aa gai hai
 Those traveling in the metro are upset with this news
 dilli kii metro rail main logon kii suraksha ke liye sisitivi camere lagaae gaye hai
 From those cameras, it can be ascertained whether a criminal has entered inside for the purpose of committing an incident
 lekin un sisitivi camaron se ashleel ms ban rahe hai or inhen aplod kiya ja rahaa he porn cites par
 According to the news reported by Aaj Tak, in 2011, these pictures were recorded when some lovers couple were obscene with CCTV cameras
 sisitivi footage ko mobile phone se shoot karke unki video clip bana lee gai or internet par maujuud kuch porn cites par aplod kar diya gaya
 At present, 3 such video clips have been detected, out of which 2 are recorded inside the metro train and the third video is from the deserted place of Green Park Metro Station
 lekin metro rail ke sutron se mil rahi khabaron ke mutabik, metro main ashleel ms abhi naa jane kitne premi jodon kaa dil dahala sakati he
 Because it is feared that more than three mmss may have been uploaded to porn sites
 privesi par sidhe hamalaa he ye vaardaatye sahi he ki metro safar ko suvidhajanak or aasaan banane ke liye he
 The metro should also be used for this reason
 lekin dilli metro or isaki suraksha dekh rahi siaisef sawaalon ke ghere main he
 When the existence of the evening begins to get lost in the darkness of night, then the CCTV cameras of the Delhi Metro are often seen taking pictures which are very objectionable
 had to ye he ki suraksha ke liye metro ke jin sisitivi camaron main tasviren kaid hoti hai, agar usamen kuch ashleel hua to wo tasviren porn cites tak pahunch jaati hai
 That is an attack on your privacy directly
 lekin kamaal kii baat to ye he ki metro rail chalaane vaali dilli metro rail korporation yani dmarsi or metro kii suraksha main lagi central industrial security force yani siaisef donon hi pallaa jhaad rahe hai
 a few questions from Delhi Metro, but those who talk about the rights of the people are very upset with this incident
 agar dilli ke logon ko sabase zyada kisi cheez par bharosa he, to wo he dilli metro rail
 But now the same question is being asked
 
 
 - ati surakshit maani jane vaali metro kii sisitivi footage kaise porn cites par pahunch gayi?- in tasveeron main agar suraksha par koi sawaal nahin tha, to phir inhen khatm kyon nahin kar diya gaya?- kya dilli metro ke kisi bhi bade adhikari ko isaki bhanak nahin thi ki metro main kya chal rahaa he?- kya metro kii suraksha kaa jimmaa sanbhaalane vaali siaisef ke kisi senior adhikari ne in tasveeron ko nahin dekha?- kya do saal puraani tasveeron ke maamle main ye jaanch karaane kii jahamat uthaai gai ki kaise footage li ho rahi hai?lekin had to ye he ki ashleel clips ne dmarsi or siaisef kii bolti band kar di he
 Women Commission sent notice to DMRC, but Women's Commission is very upset
 mahila ayog ne khud pahal karte hue dmarsi ko notice bhej diya he
 The Women's Commission has asked the DMRC in two weeks to seek the Action Taken Report (ATR)
 mahila ayog ne apni chintaa jataate hue kaha he ki agar metro kii footage aise hi li hoti raheen to mahilaon ke liye metro main safar karnaa mushkil ho jayega
 Ideally, Delhi Metro and CISF should express their views on this
 lekin sutron se mili khabaron ke mutabik jahaan siaisef ye kahkar apni gardan bachaana chaahati he ki sisitivi footage par najar rakhane kii jimmedaari bhale hi uski he, lekin databes to dmarsi ke paas hota he
 At the same time, DMRC is clear that since the CISF also watches the footage in the control room, the whole lot cannot be blown out on the DMRC alone
 haalanki mahila ayog kii sakriyata se dilli metro or siaisef kii sachai do hafte main khulne ke asaar hai, lekin metro ke ms cond ne sabko hilaa to jarur diya he
 What can happen in the case, action is the identity of Delhi Metro train
 lekin yahi pahchaan in dinon kaiyon kii jaan kaa dushman bani hui he
 For those whose pornographic MMS was created with the camera of Delhi Metro, the journey of the metro will not be less than a scary dream
 jaanch kaa pitara khul chukaa he
 If Delhi Metro is guilty or some officers of CISF or both have committed this disgusting act, it will take time to be disclosed
 lekin ye bhi tay he ki jo bhi gunahagaar he, uske liye aane vaale din bade mushkil bhare hone vaale hai
 According to experts, full responsibility for the confidentiality of the footage rests with the DMRC
