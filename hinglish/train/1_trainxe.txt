 The court said that the UP government has no control over its officers and on the contrary, the court is saying that it should cancel the allotment without listening to the other party
 court ne upi kii yogi sarkaar ko kaha ki wo daryaft kare ki koun-koun se ilaakon main abhi bhi nae projects ko ijazat di gai he
 The court also said that institutions like NTPC, UPEC gave land for projects blindly
 ab jab 26 saal baad wo jameen par daawa kar rahe hai to ekatarfa daawa radd karne par utaaru he

 kitabanelis in corporatland (english)lekhakatulika treepathikimatah299 rupeedishnahard bouns, 125 pejpublishrampenguin books indiacharles lutvij dowson ne 1865 main levis carol ke lekhkeey naam se elice naam kii ladki kaa aisa kirdaar gadha, jisane apni kaalpanik duniya ke romaanch se sabake dilon main jagah bana lee
 Alice gaeh-bahaga takes us to places that are not really there
 lekin ham uske peeche yun hi barabas chal padate hai
 Charles would hardly have thought that Alice's character would become synonymous with the world of romantic thoughts
 ek aisi duniya yahaan pathak apni hi duniya main khoyaa rahegaa
 His curiosity or, say, his desires will make him travel to an unfamiliar world whose existence is nowhere beyond imagination
 tulika treepathi kii kitaab 'elice in corporatland' main bhi ham ek aisi hi ladki elice se milte hai jo mandi ke samay main graduate hui he
 Just one day before the start of her working life, she dives into the ocean of adventure and imagination and her splashes make our mind happy too
 saal 1865 kii us puranic katha kii tarah hi is kahani main bhi elice ek khargosh ke bill kaa peechha karti he or phir khud ko ek 'corporate land' main paati he
 In this magical and fantasy journey, Alice meets Pinocchio, Cinderella, 7 Dwarf, Rapunzel, and Peter Pan, who give her career tips and training in her own style
 kitaab is myne main khaas ho jaati he ki yah aapako romaanch kaa anubhav dene ke saath hi ek kushal prashikshak kii tarah 'corporate' duniya kii baarikiyon se bhi avgat karaati he
 To connect readers to Alice, Tulika gives full details of Alice's condition
 masalan, mandi kaa samay he, naukariyaan nahin mil rahi hai or elice bataur intern yani prashikshu apane kariyar kii shuruyaat kar rahi he
 This story tells how Alice makes a place for herself in this 'corporate land' changing every moment
 kaise vah kaamkaaji duniya main khud ko behatar or behatar karti jaati he or sabase khaas baat yah ki aap is puri yatra main uske saath hote hai or mahasoos karte hai jaise sab kuch aapaki ankhon ke saamne ghatit ho rahaa ho
 The specialty of the writing art of a book or booklet is that as Alice moves on a corporate land walk, she learns its nuances, understands the importance of goals and the importance of patience
 saath hi pathak main bhi in vichaaron kaa sanchaar hota he
 In order to read the book, you think that i wish there was a person who would tell you about such tips and tricks in the beginning of his career
 kahaan rah gai kamikoi bhi rachana har tarah se purna nahin hoti
 If we discuss the shortcomings of this book, the writer has not been able to decide in many places whether she is writing a 'guide book' or an exciting and fantasy story
 is kahani main 'corporate land' ke aise kai vivaran yaa ghatnaayen hai jo aapako aapaki pichhali bhul or usase judi sikh kii yaad dilaati he
 But at the same time, it seems a bit difficult to reconcile the animals and birds between the events happening in many places and the storyline
 kyon padhaa javogar aap apane kariyar kii shuruyaat kar rahe hai yaa phir bich kariyar main kahin atak gaye hai to yah kitaab aapke liye he
 It gives you suggestions as well as entertains you
 kya he alagaaisa nahin he ki yah is tarah kii ek akeli kitaab he
 Along with Vikas Swarup's 'the Accidental Apprentice' and Ashwin Sanghi's 'chanakya Chant', many such books have been written on the same story
 lekin 'elice in corporate land' kaa sandesh or suzav dene kaa tarika dusron se alag he

 Like the rest of the prisoners in the morning, they had breakfast in the daily routine at 7 am and then read the newspaper
 jail prashasan nechidambaram se unase mulaakaat karne waalon ke naam maange hai
 They have not given their names yet
 har hafte 2 baar unase mulaakaat karne vaale mil sakate hai
 The jail has a visiting room
 jahaan mulaaqaat karne vaale milte hai
 He has been sent to judicial custody for two weeks by a court in the INX Media corruption case
 jail ke adhikariyon ne bataaya ki congress netaa ko brihaspativaar shaam ko jail main laayaa gaya ore unhen alag kothri or western shauchalay ke alaava koi vishesh suvidhaayen nahin milegi
 These special facilities have been given to him by the court at his request
 adaalat ne unhen jail main apane saath chashma, dawaaen le jane kii anumati di or nirdesh diya ki unhen tihaad jail main alag kothri main rakhaa jaae kyonki unhen jed shrenee kii suraksha mili hui he
 Like other prisoners, he can visit the prison library and watch television for a fixed period
 sutron ne bataaya ki chidambaram ne aaj halkaa naashtaa kiya
 Last night, they ate rotis, pulses, vegetables and rice according to the jail menu
 purv kendriya grih mantri chidambaram ko rouj avenue main ek vishesh sibiai adaalat se brihaspativaar ko nile rang kii police bas main jail main laayaa gaya
 It is a strange coincidence that he has been lodged in Jail number 7 where his son had been in the INX Media case for 12 days last year
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki jail ko pehle hi taiyaar kar diya gaya tha kyonki jail adhikariyon ko abhas tha ki congress ke varisht netaa ke khilaaf chal rahe adalati maamalon ke maddenjar unhen yahaan laayaa ja saktaa he
 Jail number 7 is actually the prisoners who face Enforcement Directorate (ED) cases
 madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri kamalnath ke bhaanje ratul puri ko bhi is jail main band kiya gaya he
 The ED is investigating agustawestland and a bank fraud case
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki abhi tihaad jail main 17,400 kaidi hai jinamein kareeb 14,000 vichaaradhin kaidi shaamil hai
 As of 31 December 2018, 14,938 men and 530 women were lodged in Tihar Jail, compared to 2 on 31 December 2017
 20 pratishat adhik sankhya he
 This increase is due to the increase in the number of prisoners under consideration
 tihaad jail main divangat congress netaa sanjay gandhi, purv jeenuasu netaa kanhaiya kumaar, rajd pramukh lalu yadav, udyogpati subrat roy, gangster chota rajan or charles shobhraj, saamaajik kaaryakarta anna hajaare or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal samet kai hai-profile kaidi rah chuke hai
 Nirbhaya gangrape convicts are also lodged in this jail

 Sachin: a Billion Dreams is a documentary drama
 yah cricket ke bhagwaan sachin tendulkar kii kahani he
 The film shows the story of how a boy from a middle-class family reaches the heights of fame
 yah film sachin ke mehnat ko dikhaati he or bataati he ki sapalata ke liye koi short-cat nahin hota
 The film begins with daughter Sarah, the film begins with a video in which she has her little daughter Sara on the lap
 yah real video he or us samay kaa he, jab sara paidaa hui thim
 When Sachin took her for the first time in his lap, he said that 'I am very scared to catch it'
 phir film kii kahani sachin ke bachapan kii taraf kahani badhati he
 Sachin was quite naughty in childhood
 wo kabhi kisi kii gaadi kii hawa nikaal dete the
 Photos of Sachin's film premiere Sister's Bat Changed zindagischin's life changes when his elder sister presents him with a bat
 iske baad sachin apane bade bhai ajit ke saath cricket khelnaa shuru kar dete hai
 The 1983 World Cup gave a new direction to Sachin's life
 wo cricket ko apni manzil maanane lage or worldcup jeetne kaa sapana dekhne lage
 The journey from cricket practice to his first match with his mentor Achrekar ji is in drama form
 film main baad main zyaadaatar asli videos dikhaae gaye hai or alag-alag logon ke jariye kahani aage badhati he
 The exciting and emotional aspects of sachinmaster-blaster's life were seen in the film's premiere daughter's hair grooming
 1) Sachin was known to everyone since childhood
 mata-pita kaa unpar vishwaas tha, sachin jo karnaa chaahate the unhen wo karne diya gaya
 Elder brother Ajit considered his destination as his destination and always supported him
 2) sachin kii jindagi kaa pehla match pakistan ke khilaaf tha, tab pakistani khilaadiyon ne unhen bahut halke main liya tha
 But about him, Wasim Akram said that in Sachin, he had seen the beginning of becoming a great player
 3) bada khilaadi banane ke baad bhi sangeet se unka lagaav tha
 By the way, he was named because of the famous musician Sachin Dev Burman
 gaanaa bhi gaate hai sachin, kya aapane suni unki aawaaj4) khel ke prati chaahe barish ho yaa dhoop, sachin ne kabhi cricket practice ke saath samjhauta nahin kiya
 If he were out early, how would he work on his shortcomings
 5) ek adarsh putr, ek adarsh pati or apane do bacchon ke pita ke taur par wo kaise the ye bakhubi darshaya gaya he
 6) How some senior players did not listen to him after becoming the cricket captain and his feud with Mohammad Azharuddin is also shown very well
 ek real video main yang sachin apane phans ko autograph de rahe hai or bagal main chupchaap azhar baithe hai
 Along with Ravi Shastri's commentary where he is saying in gestures that it is clear how the limelight is changing
 7) ek safal khilaadi kaa downfall dikhaaya he jab akhbaar kii head line tendulkar ke bajaay "endulkar" banane lagi
 During that time, how he spent time with the family - in a video, Sachin is seen joking with his son and daughter
 8) 2007 main sharmasaar haar ke baad 2011 main world cap jeetne kii mehnat ko bahut achche se dikhaaya he
 9) Some amazing videos where Sachin is cutting cake with his team mates after making 35 centenary, or is walking around in his foreign location with wife children like a common man, which is not suitable for him in India
 10 ) pita ko khone kaa dard or kis tarah unhone apane pita ko hi apana bhagwaan mana
 The first time Sachin's wife told him the news of his father's death in a hotel room
 
 
 wo pal dekhakar darshak apni ankhon main aansu nahin roak pate
 Sachin's party is illuminated by stars, but viewers will find these issues 1) He looks like a love story of Sachin and Anjali, as a son, father and husband, but the part of how the love story started was not in the film
 2) vinod kambli jo unke bachapan ke dost the unke saath pehali badi partnership kaa zikr jarur he lekin baad main unke or kambli ke bich kii daraar film main nahin he
 It is difficult to tell the story of the documentary, it is difficult to tell the film on Dhoni, but the director James Arkaskin, writer Sandeep Srivastava and Sivakumar Anant, have to praise the way they put Sachin's childhood in drama form in this film And later, through the actual videos, the story is carried forward and in between, only Sachin was shown as the narrator
 saath hi sachin kii patni aurasachinke seniors sunil gavaskar, kapil dev or ravi shastri ke intervyuuj ke zariye bhi kahani ko dilachasp banaaya he , sachin ke fans ke saath mahanayake amitabh bachchan ke intervyuu bhi hai jahaan wo bataa rahe sachin jab field par utarate the to un sabaki ummiden bad jaati thim
 Yes, this film should not be compared to Dhoni's biopic as it was a complete fiction
 pita ko yaad kar bhavuk hue sachin
 
 
 No Stars because the stars have faded in front of Sachin
 
 
 ab sawaal is film ko kitne stars diye jaaen to jawaab he sachin tendulkar kii kahani parde par dekhne ke liye sirf sachin kaa naam hi kaaphi he
 Every person who wants to achieve something in life must watch this film

 Such stories are beloved by all children, but some children do not enjoy these stories like normal children do, because either these children are unable to see or hear or some are struggling with problems like ortism
 ab ensiiasti ne prayog ke taur par 40 story books kaa ek aisa sat taiyaar kiya he, jise saamaanya or mookbadhir samet har tarah ke bachche pard sakenge
 NCERT professor Anupam Ahuja says, 'every child has the same desire
 abhi paathyakram main unke liye bhale hi alag-alag tarah kii kitaaben banaai jaati hai, lekin hamane ye story books taiyaar kii hai jo saare bachche ek saath pard sakate hai or unamem hin bhaavana nahin aegi
 ' ensiiarti ne ye kitaaben koi dedh saal ke project ke baad taiyaar kii hai, jiske tahat chatpati, manabhaavan kahaniyaan chitron ke zariye samajhaaii gai hai, jahaan kahani likhi hai, uske saath hi braille lipi main shabd likhe gaye hai taaki jo bachche dekh nahin sakate vah bhi usee kitaab se pard saken
 Also, at the time of printing the pictures have been raised such that children can identify the characters by touching the story
 'itnaa hi nahin agar kahani main kahin koi kathin shabd aa jaataa he to uskaa arth alag se samajhane ke liye vahiin par ek windonuma khancha bana he, jise chhukar us kathin shabd kaa arth netraheen bachche samaj sakate hai
 It will not hurt them to understand the story
 ' In making the book, it has been taken care that children should not have any problem in identifying the pages from the page to the front and back cover of the book and all the pages
 iske liye alag-alag rangon or ubhaaron kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 a digital version of these books is also being brought along with them
 desh main 2 pratishat bachche aise hai jo kisi na kisi tarah kii viklaangata kaa shikaar hai
 Children's abilities may vary, but the urge to move forward and the desire to learn are the same
 
 This is definitely an initiative but the real benefit will be only when these books come in the syllabus

 Now, no one other than the army was allowed to come here
 2003 main bharat or pakistan ke bich yudhviram sandhi ho gai
 Since that time, firing and shelling has stopped in this area
 vivaad kii vajah:1972 ke shimla samjhaute main is ilaake ko bejaan or banjar qaraar diya gaya yani yah ilaaka insaanon ke rahane ke laayak nahin he
 The agreement did not say where the border between India and Pakistan would be in Siachen
 uske baad se is kshetra par pakistan ne apana adhikaar jataana shuru kar diya
 The upper part of this glacier is currently occupied by India and the lower part by Pakistan

 Most of the time, the temperature is below 50 degrees below zero

 ’ The murder of a bank manager in Jehanabad, Bihar, has been exposed
 police jaanch main pataa chalaa he ki bank manager kii hatya unki eemaandaaree ke chalate hui or bank kaa hi ek karmchaaree unki hatya kaa mastermind niklaa
 The police have arrested and sent 6 accused, including a bank employee, who was planning to murder
 police ne bataaya ki bank kii jahanabad branch ke manager alok chandra kii sajeesh usee branch main niyukt sahaayak prabandhak rajesh kumaar ne rachi thi
 Actually this whole case was taken by Brajesh Kumar, a businessman in Arwal district
 5 karod ke lone se judaa hua he
 Investigation revealed that Brajesh Kumar Nefarji kept this Loneley on the basis of documents
 branch manager alok chandra lagaataar brajesh kumaar ko dastavej durust karne ke liye kah rahe the
 While Brajesh was pressurizing him to send those fake documents only to the regional office, so that his loan does not get hampered
 alok chandra lekin eemaandaaree ke saath lone ko clear na karne par ade rahe
 Considering that Alok Chandra did not believe, the murder was hatched and no one else was involved in the conspiracy, Rajesh Kumar, assistant manager of the same bank turned out
 rajesh ne hi brajesh ko uksaaya ki 'jab tak alok chandra is bank main hai tab tak tumhaara kaam nahin ho saktaa
 Get him out of the way, then you will be done
 ' police ne bataaya ki rajesh kii brajesh se pehle se najdiki rahi he
 Not only this, Rajesh also paid Rs
 30,000 to five miscreants for the murder of Alok Chandra
 jahanabad ke SP manish kumaar ne araval police ke sahyog se is hatyakand kaa khulaasa kiya
 Police investigation has revealed the involvement of seven miscreants, out of which six miscreants have been arrested

 Please tell that on 21 May this year, Alok Chandra was killed on the way to the bank

 Some time ago Naxalites fired here, we want to stop all this completely

 -input bhashaa se The identity of a human being gives the reason for living his existence
 lekin jab pahchaan, pareshaani or pareshaani daag ban jaae to jeena muhaal ho jaataa he
 Then his biggest problem was that the whole society neither considered him man nor woman
 samaaj ke banaae dastur main ab tak bas do gender yaa yun kahen ki do hi darja he
 That means you can be either a man or a woman

 Yes, now more than five million eunuchs present in the country have been included in the third grade
 jab achaanak tik jaati hai unpar najrankabhi bheed main to kabhighar ke angan main
 Sometimes on the road or sometimes in a gathering
 kabhi dholak kii thap par to kabhi taaliyon kii aawaaj par thirakate un chehron ko aapane kai baar dekha hoga
 These are the ones who whenever they come in front of them do not want to be seen
 inaki pahchaan hi kuch aisi bani hai thi kihar khaaso-aam inase bas kisi tarah peechha chhudaana chahta tha
 But when they themselves fall behind someone, then it is not easy to get rid of them
 duniya main or duniya ke saath-saath hindustan main bhi ab tak bas do shreniyan yani do gender thim or inhen do darjon yani mard or aurat ko tamaam jaruri pahchaan, haq, suvidhaayen, adhikaar hasil thim
 But on April 15, the country's largest court i
e
 the Supreme Court gave such a historic decision that suddenly a third gender ie third grade has been born as soon as the decision comes
 pichhadi jatiyon ke samaan adhikardesh kii pachaas lakh se bhi zyada kinnaron ko izzat se sir uthaa kar jeene kaa haq de diya he
 The Supreme Court has called them as third gender and has given them all the rights that the backward castes have
 inamen shiksha, swasthya, naukari, aarakshan sabhi shaamil hai
 Not only this, the Supreme Court has given the right to adopt eunuchs as well as to change the sex of the eunuchs by giving them the right to become women or men
 apane is haq ke liye kinnar birdari varshon se ladaai lard rahi thi
 Until 1871, eunuchs had the right to transgender in India
 magar 1871 main angrejon ne kinnaron ko criminal tribs yani jaraimpesha janajati kii shrenee main daal diya tha
 Later, in 1951, the eunuchs were removed from the criminal tribes when a new constitution of Azad Hindustan was enacted
 magar unhen unka haq tab bhi nahin mila tha
 However since then these eunuchs were living in the same world in which we and you live
 lekin inase hamaari or aapaki mulaakaat sirf khushiyon ke maukey par hoti he
 Free will or force
 jinhen badanaseeb samajha jaataa he unka kaam he sirf duaen dena
 But there is also a truth of these prayers
 har saal 40-50 hajaar kinnar, lekin kaise?hamaare or aapke liye kinnar sirf kinnar hote hai
 Most people either avoid facing eunuchs or hate them
 shaayad hi koi ho jo kinnaron ko kareeb se jaanane kii koshish karata ho
 There is hardly anyone who has tried to get into the world of eunuchs
 kinnaron kii duniya kii sachai behad khaufnak or khulaason bharaa he
 There is an increase of 40-50 thousand in the number of kiners every year in the country
 deshbhar ke tamaam kinnaron main se 90 fisad aise hote hai jinhen banaaya jaataa he
 There are currently four goddesses of Kinnars in the country
 samay ke saath kinnar birdari main wo log bhi shaamil hote chale gaye jo janaana bhav rakhte hai
 The world of Kinnars has its own laws and its own customs
 kinnaron kii jab maut hoti he to use kisi gaiyr kinnar ko nahin dikhaaya jaataa
 It is believed that by doing this, the next born person will also be born
 kinnar murde ko jalaate nahin balki dafnaate hai
 Between dream and reality, the life of the people is secret and it keeps other people of society eager towards them
 kinnaron kii duniya kaa ek khaufnak sach yah bhi he ki yah samaaj aise ladakon kii talash main rahata he jo khubasurat ho
 Whose gait should be gentle, and who sees the dream of rising high
 yah samudaay usase najdiki badhaata he or phir samay aate hi use badhiya kar diya jaataa he
 Castration, that is, cutting off part of his body, after which he is never a boy
 sangharsh ke dinon main kai nirmaataa nirdeshkon ne amitabh bachchan ko unki khamiyaan ginaakar filmon main lene se manaa kar diya tha
 Not only this, when he went for audition in Akashwani, his voice was rejected there, but he turned all his alleged flaws into virtues and proved that those who rejected him were wrong
 aaj bhi hai lokapriyafilm samikshakon kii najar main big bi kii safalataa ne unhen milinium star se bhi kaaphi aage pahunchaa diya he
 Film critic Ram Kishore Parcha says that Amitabh Bachchan is not an artist of any generation, but an artist of every generation
 vah jitne lokapriy 1970 or 80 ke dashak main the utane hi lokapriy aaj kii peedi main bhi hai
 Many styles given to Indian cinema He said that Big b has given many styles to Indian cinema
 1975 ke baad jahaan unhone engri yang main kii style ko janm diya vahiin 80 main unhone kamedi kii ek nayi style sthapit kii
 Parcha says that in the 1970s there was no better artist than Amitabh Bachchan in better understanding the characters of films
 anya kalakaar kisi ek khaas style se bandhe the, lekin amitabh bachchan ne har tarah kii bhoomikaaon ko bakhubi nibhaakar dikhaaya
 Encouraged by its performance in the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress has also decided to field alone in the assembly elections in Bihar this year and the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 congress ke varisht netaa or congress kaarysmiti main vishesh aamantrit sadsy anil shastri ne kaha, ‘‘bihar or uttarapradesh vidhansabha chunaav main hamane gathbandhan nahin karne kaa nirnay kiya he
 Our main contest will be with BSP, which did not perform well
 samaajawaadee party or bhaajapa ab koi takat nahin rahi
 He said that the biggest achievement of the Congress under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi would be formation of its government in the state with the largest population of the country after two decades

 An audience of KBC, along with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Nitesh Rane and Shri Rajput Karni Sena on social media, protested over the question of the program, where the Maratha warrior ruler was referred to as Shivaji
 jaise hi hesh tag boykot kebisi soni tivi soshal media par trend karne laga, vaise hi sho ko banane vaali company ne saarvajanik taur par apni galati maanate hue maafee maang lee
 The controversy began after the show, when the show's host Amitabh Bachchan questioned in kbc's recent episode: Which of these rulers was a contemporary of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb? A) Maharana Pratap, B) Rana Sanga, C) Maharaja Ranjit Singh, D) Shivaji
 is jawaab kaa uttar di) shivaji tha
 But answering the question, Bachchan addressed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as Shivaji only
 jaldi hi kai darshakon ne is par aapatti jataate hue kaha ki soni channel or amitabh bachchan ne mahaan maratha shaasha chhatrapati shivaji maharaj kaa apmaan kiya he or iske liye unhen maafee maangani chahie

 " US President Donald Trump's claim about mediation on Kashmir has been exposed
 democratic party ke saansad bread sherman ne kaha, 'sabhi jaanate hai bhartiya pradhanmantri narendra modi aisi baat kabhi nahin karenge
 Everyone who knows anything about the foreign policy of South Asia knows that India has been consistently opposing the mediation of third parties in the Kashmir issue
 sabhi jaanate hai ki piem modi kabhi aisi baat nahin karenge
 Trump's statement is outrageous and misleading and also embarrassing
 maine bhartiya rajdoot harsh shringla se trump kii is gairasanjida or sharmasaar karne vaali galati ke liye maafi maangi he
 i have apologized to Indian Ambassador Harsh v Shringla for Donald Trump's amateur and embarrassing mistake
 ' vahiin bharat kii kadi pratikriya ke baad ab america kii taraf se bhi is maamle main safaai ai he
 The US State Department has issued a statement endorsing the Indian side which said that talks are possible only after the end of terrorism
 iske alaava is bayaan main kashmir vivaad ko dwipaksheeya maamla bhi bataaya gaya he
 On the other hand, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor has also strongly disagreed with Trump's statement
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe vaaki nahin lagata he ki trump ko thodaa bhi andaja he ki vah kya baat kar rahe hai? yaa to unhen kisi ne maamle kii jaankaree nahin di yaa vah samajhe nahin ki modi kya kah rahe the yaa phir bharat kaa tisare paksh kii madhyasthata ko lekar kya rukh he
 The Ministry of External Affairs should clarify on this matter that India has never talked about any such arbitration
 '' gauratlab he ki pakistani pradhanmantri imran khan ke saath sanyukt samvaadadaata sammelan main trump ne somvaar ko kaha ki modi do hafte pehle unke saath the or unhone kashmir maamle par madhyasthata kii peshkash kii thi
 Trump also said that i think India wants a solution and Pakistan too
 yah masalaa 70 saal se chal rahaa he
 i would be happy to mediate this
 duusari ore se congress ne america raashtrapati donald trump ke daawey ko lekar mangalvaar ko piem modi par tikhaa hamalaa bolaa or sawaal kiya ki pradhanmantri jawaab den ki unhone yah peshkash kii thi yaa phir trump jhooth bol rahe hai
 The party's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala tweeted, "now the White House has made it completely clear in writing that Prime Minister Modi had asked President Trump to mediate on Kashmir
 ' unhone sawaal kiya, 'hamaare pradhanmantri kab jaagenge or agar trump jhooth bol rahe hai to use bakawaas bataaenge? yaa phir vahi sawaal ki kya pradhanmantri modi ne america raashtrapati se madhyasthata ke liye kaha tha?'

 Sania Mirza is the first woman in the South Asian region to be appointed a goodwill ambassador in the history of UN Women
 unhone kaha, meraa maananaa he ki bharat main khelon main adhik mahilaon ko aana chahie
 Culture needs to change
 sarkaar isamen shaamil ho rahi he or mujhe lagata he ki isse kaaphi chizon main badlaav ho rahaa he
 Our current Sports Minister Sarbananda Sonowal promotes women's sports a lot and i have personally seen this
 sania ne kaha, mujhe khushi he ki sarkaar bhi hamaare samaaj main vyaapt ling asamanta par baat kar rahi he or sachai yah he ki vah ise lekar kuch karne kii koshish kar rahi he, jisase pataa chalata he ki yah kitna jaruri he
 Sania Mirza said, "we need a cultural change and hope that the media will also take responsibility for it
" media kii bhoomika ahm hoti he
 He can bring change and he should do so
 unhone kaha, ling samanta kaa ham sabhi ko samarthan karnaa chahie
 Some speak about it, some do not
 mujhe is par bolne ke liye chunaa gaya he
 i hope that one day everyone will say that we are all one and that women will not be treated like objects
 main badlaav laane ke liye apni taraf se har sambhav koshish karuungi
 The tennis star also stated that he is excited to play in the International Premier Tennis League (ITPL) starting on 6 December
 unhone kaha, main aaj raat ko ravaanaa ho rahi hum
 i will go to practice from here and then directly to the airport
 main isko lekar bahut utsahit hum
 i am ready to play in ITPL
 kya ham kisi akashwani ke intazaar main he ki jab pradhanmantri bolenge to aisa bolenge, jo ab tak nahin bolaa gaya he
 What remains to be heard, which we are waiting for the Prime Minister to speak
 har bahes or lekh main yaad dilaayaa ja rahaa he ki are haa, pradhanmantri to bol hi nahin rahe hai
 They speak so much, but why are they silent on this? kya ve bhi maun mohan singh kii tarah maun modi ho gaye hai
 They are not speaking in the mind, they are not talking to the people
 pichley do hafte se unki sarkaar ke mantri or party ke pravaktaa jor-jor se bol hi rahe he ki kuch galat nahin hua he
 Will the Prime Minister say something different, will he say yes, wrong
 meri party ke pravaktaa jhooth bol rahe the
 Well, he used to speak a lot in the elections, but any leader has a challenge to remove two Chief Ministers and two Union Ministers together, it will kill him silently
 aap beshak unki majaburi kii tulana manmohan singh se kar sakate hai
 If you find happiness in this, definitely do, but what a Prime Minister would not know about the black and white exploits of his leaders
 kya unhen pataa nahin ki unke saansad, vidhayak kahaan se paisa laate hai
 Do they not know where the money comes from the leaders of the opposing parties
 yahi kaaran tha ki manmohan singh chup rahete the, yahi kaaran he ki pradhanmantri modi ko chup rahanaa pad rahaa he
 The Prime Minister must have wanted to speak
 ve jab bhi kisi sabha main jate honge unki nigahen unase bachati hongi ki kahin koi is ummid main to nahin aa gaya he ki mujhe vasundhara raaje or sushamaa par bolnaa he
 When they go to tweet about the birthday, the thought comes that no one should write down when Vasundhara will speak on the matter
 pradhanmantri ke liye chup rahanaa itnaa aasaan nahin he
 Lalit Modi has also named Arun Jaitley, Rajiv Shukla, Robert Vadra and Priyanka Gandhi
 wo apane ghar se lekar dusron ke ghar tak ke maamle main kya-kya bolenge
 Where will i speak? pradhanmantri bhi sochate honge ki kya din aa gaye hai, jab mukhyamantri tha to apane upar lage aaropon se pareshaan rahata tha, tab sab meraa bachaav karte the, aaj jab ve pradhanmantri bane hai to unhen un sabakaa bachaav karnaa pad rahaa he
 He has to bear the charges against him
 isliye main khulkar bolne waalon kii takalif samajhataa hum
 Their silence invites them from within
 unhone selfi vid dotrs kaa abhiyaan chalavaaya taaki soshal media par unhen lekar kuch or baaten bhi ho saken
 Critics were highly praised when the sarpanch of the village launched this campaign, but when the Prime Minister took it forward, everyone started criticizing it
 zarur dekhnaa chahie ki gaanv ke sarpanch ne apni kamiyon ko chhipaane ke liye ek nek abhiyaan kaa sahaara to nahin liya, lekin sirf is baat ko aadhaar banaakar unke abhiyaan par sawaal uthaanaa bhi thik nahin he
 This question is important, whether the reality will change with these campaigns
 kahin nahin badali to kahin badali bhi he par isse aise abhiyaanon kii zarurat to rahegi hi
 Listening also means speaking
 kai log yaad dilaa rahe hai ki gujarat main mukhyamantri ke taur par dangon ke aarope main jail gayi maaya kodenani ko tab tak nahin hataaya jab tak unhen jail nahin bheja gaya
 With the help of such arguments, the Aam Aadmi Party members are saying that we too removed Jitendra Singh Tomar only when he went to jail
 pradhanmantri main ye aadat acchhee he
 They do not remove anyone
 grahamantri rajnath singh ne thik kaha tha ki ye en di e hai, yahaan istife nahin hote
 Is this not the statement of the Prime Minister? jab tak ve khandan nahin karte tab tak yah bayaan pradhanmantri kaa hi he
 Also think that if they are not making any plan to keep quiet and stop speaking to others
 2000 se 2015 tak kii raajnneeti main maine netaa ke taur par narendra modi kii koi haar nahin dekhi he
 That's why excited people tighten their waist properly
 unki chuppi se kai logon ko salaahkaar banane kaa mauka mil gaya he
 They have started writing articles that the Prime Minister is doing his loss by not speaking
 koi upaay bataa rahaa he ki kaash pradhanmantri karyaalay main media salaahkaar hota
 It is good in this condition that there is no one or else every other news is that even the Prime Minister's media advisors are not picking up the phone
 unka mobile chaar dinon se band he
 Manmohan Singh had also kept, which arrow he shot
 jab media main itane salaahkaar hai hi to tankhwaah or pad dekar kisi ko salaahkaar rakhane kii zarurat kya he
 a person who can become a Prime Minister by contesting elections on his own and ruining his party and anti-politics, can also work without media advice
 ham sab bhrashtachar ko 3 ghante kii film kii tarah dekhne lage hai
 Let the end of the story be peaceful and the triumph of truth prevail
 bhrashtachar hi aaj kii raajnneeti kaa paalankarta he
 The one who eats it will be erased
 congress ho yaa bhaajapa, janata dal yaa samaajawaadee sab bhrashtachar ke paise se hi naitikta kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 We all want the film to end and corruption will be lost for the next film
 aaj kisi ne google se unke bhaashan kaa ek ansh nikaal kar diya
 i started listening
 pradhanmantri elahabaad kii sabha main bol rahe the
 While listening, i also thought that cleanliness will happen, but don't we know that it is difficult
 aapke liye likh rahaa hum ki unhone kya bolaa
 Has typed his speech verbatim
 tippaniyan "you tell me that criminalization should not end in politics
 gundgardee jaani chahie ki nahin chahie
 The politics of bomb guns should or should not end
 maa ganga kii dharti se mujhe aashirwad do
 Brothers and sisters of Allahabad bless me
 main maut ko mutthi main lekar niklaa hum
 i want to fight against crime in politics
 main apradheekaran kaa khaatmaa karne ke liye aapkaa aashirwad chahta hum
 Let me tell you nai sarkaar banane ke baad ye jitne parliament ke member chunakar aaenge, unhone apana namakan bharte samay affidavit main likhaa he kis par kitne cese darj hue hai, sab likhaa hua he
 i will give all these things to the Supreme Court
 supreme court ko haath jodakar kahuunga ki aisi vyavastha karo ki ye jo nae chunakar aae hai, sabakaa khaataa khol do
 Run the case, within a year, put other people who are guilty, in jail, those who are innocent, send them to Parliament
 or jo jail jaaenge wo seat khaali ho jaaegi, upachunaav aayega, elahabaad main maaloom hai na
 
 
 Yes 
 
 bhaaiyon bahanon ab koi badmaash, ye bam bandook kii raajnneeti karne vaale ek saal ke baad sansad main dikhaai nahin denge
 Once i will clear the Parliament and then take the assembly in hand
 vidhansabha main jitne baithe hai ( ve donon haath failaa kar chutki bajaate hai, bheed josh se bhar jaati he),doodh kaa doodh pani kaa pani karke rahoonga bhaaiyon
 i will not see any party and gotra in it
 kisi kaa nahin dekhuunga
 If Modi gets sued, that too will do
 yah bhaashan itnaa shandaar he, unki har baat par peeche se unke samarthan main jaandaar jawaab aata he
 The crowd fills with new energy
 ek saal main sansad kii kitni safai hui ye to ram jane, lekin pradhanmantri kii ek marzi to puri ho hi rahi he
 Everyone's pole is opening
 itnaa aasaan nahin he ki bhrashtachar or aparaadhiyon ko raajnneeti se saaf kar dena
 To speak means to take action
 is raste par ve nikle to kabhi laut kar saat rescorse nahin aa paaenge
 Removing all will either survive alone or will be removed by itself
 aap taiyaar hai, iske liye
 These sacrifices have to be given not only to you but also to them
 " For the last two weeks, the ministers of his government and spokespersons of the party have been speaking out loud that nothing wrong has happened
 kya pradhanmantri kuch alag kah denge, kya ve kah denge ki haa, galat hua he
 My party spokesperson was lying
 thik he ki chunaavon main bahut bolaa karte the, lekin kisi bhi netaa ke saamne do mukhyamantri or do kendriya mantri ko ek saath hataane kii chunauti ho, use chuppi maar hi jaaegi
 You can undoubtedly compare his compulsion to Manmohan Singh
 isamen khushi milti he to zarur kiijie, lekin ek pradhanmantri kya apane netaaon ke kaale-safed karnaamon ke bare main nahin jaanate honge
 Do they not know from where their mps, mlas bring money
 kya unhen pataa nahin ki virdohi dalon ke netaaon ke paas kahaan se paisa aata he
 This was the reason that Manmohan Singh kept silent, this is why Prime Minister Modi has to keep quiet
 pradhanmantri ko bolne kaa man zarur karata hoga
 Whenever he would go to any meeting, his eyes would avoid him that no one has come in the hope that i have to speak on Vasundhara Raje and Sushma
 jab ve janmdin ke bare main twit karne jate honge to khyaal to aata hi hoga ki koi yah na likh de ki vasundhara maamle par kab bolenge
 It is not so easy for the Prime Minister to keep quiet
 lalit modi ne arun jetali, rajeev shukla, robert wadra or priyanka gandhi ke bhi naam liye hai
 What will they say in terms of their home to others' home
 kahaan tak bolenge
 The Prime Minister too must have wondered whether the days have come, when the Chief Minister was upset with the allegations against him, then everyone used to defend me, today when he has become the Prime Minister, he has to defend them all
 un par lage aaropon ko sahanaa pad rahaa he
 Therefore, i understand the pain of those who speak openly
 unki chuppi unhen bheetar se bahut bulawaati he
 He started a campaign of Selfie with Daughters so that there could be some more talk about him on social media
 aalochakon ne tab to khub saraahaa tha jab gaanv ke sarpanch ne ye abhiyaan chalaaya, lekin jab pradhanmantri ne ise aage badhaayaa to sab aalochana karne lage
 It must be seen that the sarpanch of the village has not resorted to a noble campaign to hide their shortcomings, but it is also not right to question their campaign on the basis of this
 yah sawaal zaruri to he hi ki in abhiyaanon se hakeekat badalegi kya
 If it has not changed anywhere, it has also changed somewhere, but it will definitely require such campaigns
 sunanaa bhi ek tarah se bolnaa hota he
 Many are reminding that Maya Kodnani, who went to jail as Chief Minister in Gujarat on charges of rioting, was not removed until she was sent to jail
 aise daleelon ke sahare aam aadmi party vaale kah rahe hai ki hamane bhi jitendra singh tomars ko tabhi hataaya jab ve jail gaye
 This habit is good in the Prime Minister
 ve kisi ko hataate nahin hai
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh had rightly said that these are ndas, there are no resignations here
 kya ye pradhanmantri kaa bayaan nahin he
 Until he refutes this statement is the prime minister's own
 yah bhi to sochiye ki kahin ve chup rahakar dusron kii bolti band karne kaa koi plan to nahin bana rahe
 i have not seen any defeat of Narendra Modi as a leader in politics from 2000 to 2015
 isliye utsahit jan apni qamar thik se kas len
 His silence has led many to become advisors
 ve lekh likhane lage hai ki pradhanmantri nahin bolkar apana nuksaan kar rahe hai
 Some remedy is suggesting that i wish there would have been a media advisor in the Prime Minister's Office
 is haalat main to acha he ki koi nahin he varna har duusari khabar ye hoti he ki pradhanmantri ke media salaahkaar bhi phone nahin uthaa rahe hai
 His mobile is off for four days
 manmohan singh ne bhi to rakhaa tha, unhone koun-sa tir maar liya
 When there are so many advisors in the media, then what is the need to hire someone and keep an advisor? jo vyakti apane dam par chunaav ladakar apni party or virdohi raajnneeti ko dharaashahee karte hue pradhanmantri ban saktaa he vah bina media salahakar ke bhi kaam chalaa saktaa he
 We are all beginning to see corruption as a 3-hour film
 kahani kaa ant sukhaant ho or asaty par satya kii vijay ho jaae
 Corruption is the follower of today's politics
 use mitaane vaala mit jayega
 Whether it is Congress or BJP, Janata Dal or Samajwadi, all are doing politics of morality with the money of corruption
 ham sab chaahate hai ki film khatm ho or agali kisi film ke liye bhrashtachar haar jaae
 Today someone removed a piece of his speech from Google
 main sunne laga
 The Prime Minister was speaking at the Allahabad meeting
 sunate hue ek baar to mujhe bhi laga ki safai ho jaaegi lekin kya ham nahin jaanate ki mushkil he
 i am writing for you what he said
 unke bhaashan ko shabdash tip kiya he
 The comments " aap mujhe bataaiye raajnneeti main se apradheekaran khatm hona chahie ki nahin hona chahie
 Hooliganism should be done or not
 bam bandook kii raajnneeti samaapt honi chahie ki nahin chahie
 Bless me with mother Ganges soil
 elahabaad ke bhaaiyon bahanon mujhe aashirwad do
 i have come out with fists of death
 main raajnneeti main aparaadh ke khilaaf ladanaa chahta hum
 i want your blessings to end criminalization
 main aapako bataata hum
 After the formation of the new government, the number of parliament members who will come, they have written in the affidavit while filling their nomination, how many cases have been filed, all have been written
 ye sari chizein main supreme court ko de duungaa
 The Supreme Court will fold hands and make such a system that they open the account of all the new people who have come out
 cese chalaao, ek saal ke andar-adar jo gunahagaar hai, unhen jail main daalo, jo begunaah hai, unhen sansad main bhejo
 And those who go to jail, the seat will be vacant, by-elections will come, they are known in Allahabad
 
 
 haa
 
 
 Brothers and sisters no longer a crook, these bombs will not appear in Parliament after a year of gun politics
 ek baar sansad kii safai kar duungaa or phir essembly ko haath main luungaa
 As many as are sitting in the assembly (both of them spread their hands and pinch, the crowd is filled with enthusiasm), i will live with milk and milk
 isamen kisi party or gotra nahin dekhuunga
 i will not see anyone
 agar modi pe mukadmaa hoga, wo bhi chalegaa
 This speech is so brilliant, a strong reply comes in his support from every point
 bheed nai urja se bhar jaati he
 Ram knows how much Parliament was cleaned in a year, but the Prime Minister's wish is being fulfilled
 sabaki pole khul rahi he
 It is not easy to clean corruption and criminals from politics
 bolne kaa matlab he ki kaarywahi karnaa
 If they set out on this path, they would never be able to come back to the seven racecourse
 sabko hataate-hataate yaa to akele bachenge yaa khud bhi hat jaaenge
 You are ready for this
 ye balidaan sirf unhen nahin aapako bhi dena hoga
 " pradhanmantri ko bolne kaa man zarur karata hoga

 koi upaay bataa rahaa he ki kaash pradhanmantri karyaalay main media salaahkaar hota
 It is good in this condition that there is no one or else every other news is that even the Prime Minister's media advisors are not picking up the phone
 unka mobile chaar dinon se band he
 Manmohan Singh had also kept, which arrow he shot
 jab media main itane salaahkaar hai hi to tankhwaah or pad dekar kisi ko salaahkaar rakhane kii zarurat kya he
 a person who can become a Prime Minister by contesting elections on his own and ruining his party and anti-politics, can also work without media advice
 ham sab bhrashtachar ko 3 ghante kii film kii tarah dekhne lage hai
 Let the end of the story be peaceful and the triumph of truth prevail
 bhrashtachar hi aaj kii raajnneeti kaa paalankarta he
 The one who eats it will be erased
 congress ho yaa bhaajapa, janata dal yaa samaajawaadee sab bhrashtachar ke paise se hi naitikta kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 We all want the film to end and corruption will be lost for the next film
 aaj kisi ne google se unke bhaashan kaa ek ansh nikaal kar diya
 i started listening
 pradhanmantri elahabaad kii sabha main bol rahe the

 These sacrifices have to be given not only to you but also to them
 " His silence has led many to become advisors
 ve lekh likhane lage hai ki pradhanmantri nahin bolkar apana nuksaan kar rahe hai
 Some remedy is suggesting that i wish there would have been a media advisor in the Prime Minister's Office
 is haalat main to acha he ki koi nahin he varna har duusari khabar ye hoti he ki pradhanmantri ke media salaahkaar bhi phone nahin uthaa rahe hai
 His mobile is off for four days
 manmohan singh ne bhi to rakhaa tha, unhone koun-sa tir maar liya
 When there are so many advisors in the media, then what is the need to hire someone and keep an advisor? jo vyakti apane dam par chunaav ladakar apni party or virdohi raajnneeti ko dharaashahee karte hue pradhanmantri ban saktaa he vah bina media salahakar ke bhi kaam chalaa saktaa he
 We are all beginning to see corruption as a 3-hour film
 kahani kaa ant sukhaant ho or asaty par satya kii vijay ho jaae
 Corruption is the follower of today's politics
 use mitaane vaala mit jayega
 Whether it is Congress or BJP, Janata Dal or Samajwadi, all are doing politics of morality with the money of corruption

 "almost every person listening to FM in Delhi is aware of this voice
 charhare badan vaale, mridubhashi, lokapriy radio jocky raunak ke lab khulne se pehle hi unki ankhen bol padati hai
 They tickle millions of people with their rhyme and the sound of mischievous baby boo
 unke vyangy aaj ke daur main zyaadaatar logon ko bhaate hai
 But because of this, a storm of controversy also arises, and they cover up the silence remembering the advice of their guide
 vyakti kaa maahaul uski shakhsiyat ko gadhata he, raunak koi apwaad nahin hai
 Raunak has his roots in village Jahangirganj in Ambedkarnagar district of Uttar Pradesh, from where his father Jagdish Dubey arrived in Mumbai in the seventies and started a job at Godrej Company
 raunak hansate hue bataate hai, ''unke clem tu fame main ek yah he ki ve apni jenereshan main pehle the jinaki naukari lagane ke baad shaadi hui!'' mumbai main 25 disambar 1984 ko jagadish or maadhuri dube ke ghar janme raunak kii ek badi bahan seemaa or chota bhai rahul hai
 Rahul became a monk a year ago, leaving his Australian High Commission job, his home and name and now looks after the communication department of Isha Foundation under the name of Swami Tushya

 Then B
 from Kelkar College
 com karte hue 2003 main hi apana kharch nikaalane ke liye pramotor kaa kaam kiya, jiskaa kaam vibhinn utpaadon kii sampling karana tha
 Two and a half thousand rupees a month
 mil jate the or maine ghar se fees lenaa band kar diya
 During this time he worked in Wipro and some call centers to enhance communication skills
 ve har entrens test main baith jate or clear karne ke baad jab niyokta kahata ki 'oke, kal se aa jaao' to raunak kehete, ''sori, nahin aa sakate
 "actually, he was practicing the interview
 2006 main akashwani main anounsar yaa radio jocky ban gaye, jo part time job hi tha kyonki usee saal chetana college main emb main daakhila mil gaya
 In the second year of MBA, she became a supply chain manager in a retail store called Spinach and did not take any leave for three years but kept trying to enter private FM
 red efem main nau baar intervyuu dene ke baad bhi maayoos nahin hue or aakhirkaar 2009 main dasvin baar main kaamyaab ho gaye
 He moved to Lucknow where he stayed till September 2010 and then on October 4, 2010, a time of 5-9 pm was given in Delhi
 tab yuvaaon kii tarah mouj-masti kii baaten karte the or saamaajik mudde kam hi uthaate the
 But meanwhile, during a prank call while doing an evening show in December 2011, Khyali Bauwa was born in the studio of Red FM, which began to tickle people with her pristine style
 raunak bataate hai, ''shuru main mujhe ehsaas nahin hua lekin dhire-dhire usne speed pakadi or logon ko bahut pasand aane laga
 Then we made it an important part of our show
 '' 2014 main unhen subah kaa slot mil gaya, jisamen ve vibhinn muddon par baat karte
 Then in 2017 launched 'fun Ki Baat' on Zee News, a political satire
 iske alaava tivi par duusare sho kiye
 In 2009, he met Bhatkhande in Bharatanatyam's Visharad Sonam in Lucknow, and the two fell in love
 disambar 2013 main un donon kii shaadi ho gai
 raunak-sonam has her own 'bouwa' Neelkanth, born on November 9 last year
 apane gaanv se khaas lagaav rakhane vaale saukvay or hansmukh raunak shoharat kii sidhiruaan chadhate ja rahe hai
 Like 99 percent of the people of the conflict, little spent in childhood after nine tests at Turning pointred FM, in the tenth, the feedback from the available athletes, which showed that my voice brought relief to the seriously ill people, Clarity is more important than confidence
 But a little bit of confusion is also important
 piples democratic party (PDP) kii mukhiya mahabuuba mufti kaa sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karne ke baad jammu kashmir ke rajyapal satyapal malik ne vidhansabha bhang kar di
 On this, former Chief Minister of the state Mehbooba Mufti has said that this whole incident is disappointing
 mufti ne ajtak se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki rajyapal ko pehle sarkaar banane kii sambhaavnaaon par gaur karnaa chahie tha
 The ideal situation would have been to invite the largest party to form the government
 unhone aage kaha ki agar sajaad lone apane saath 18 vidhayakon ke hone kaa daawa kar rahe hai to iskaa matlab kharid-farokht ho rahi he
 We will explore further possibilities
 ek loktantr main aise faislon kii ummid nahin kii ja sakati he
 At the same time, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad has said on this development that BJP does not want to form any other government than that
 unhone aage kaha ki ab rajya main teen se chaar maheenon main chunaav ho jane chahie, kyonki ham nahin chaahate ki vahaan par rajyapal shashan lagu rahe
 He said that the bjp's dictatorial attitude has once again come in front of everyone
 aaazaad ne kaha ki abhi partiyon main baat bhi nahin hui thi or vidhayakon kii baithak bulaai gai thi lekin bijepi nahin chaahati jammu kashmir main koi sarkaar bane
 Ghulam Nabi Azad admitted that there was going to be a meeting of Congress mlas on November 23 in which we were going to consider the possibility of forming a government
 kyonki teen chaar maheenon se aisi baaten chal rahi thi ki vahaan par sarkaar banane kii sambhaavnaaon ko tatola jaae
 But the screw was getting stuck here that in such a situation neither a Congress leader was ready to become the Chief Minister nor was the National Conference agreeing to become the Chief Minister nor the PDP was seeking his Chief Minister there
 isamen vahaan sarkaar bananaa sambhav nahin ho paa rahaa tha
 Yes, Rebel definitely wanted there to be a government
 bijepi ko jaise hi pataa chalaa ki sarkaar banane kii sambhaavnaaon par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he unhone aanan-fanan main raashtrapati shashan lagu kar diya
 Here, NC President Omar Abdullah wrote in a tweet, 'the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference had been demanding dissolution of the assembly for five consecutive months
 ise sanyog nahin maan sakate ki idhar mahabuuba mufti sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karne ja rahi thim or udhar rajyapal ne vidhansabha bhang kar di
 'JKNC has been pressing for assembly dissolution for 5 months now
 It can’t be a coincidence that within minutes of Mehbooba Mufti Sahiba letter staking claim the order to dissolve the assembly suddenly appears
 - Omar Abdullah (@omarabdullah) November 21, 2018 Please tell that on Wednesday evening, Mehbooba Mufti presented the claim to the government to form the government
 iske kuch hi der baad rajyapal ne vidhansabha bhang kar di
 Governor's rule was in force since the PDP and bjp's alliance broke in the state
 isse pehle, buudhvaar ko mahabuuba ne daawa kiya tha ki unke paas congress or neshnal conference kaa samarthan he
 At the same time, State President of Bharatiya Janata Party Ravindra Raina has said that BJP welcomes this step taken by the Governor
 ek baar phir se neshnal conference, congress or pidipi jammu-kashmir main sajeesh rach rahi thi jo jammu or ladakh ke liye anyaay hota
 Will they ally before the elections? BJP welcomes the decision taken by the J&K Governor
 Once again, NC, Congress & PDP hatched a conspiracy in Jammu & Kashmir that would have done injustice to Jammu and Ladakh
 Will they form alliance before elections ?: BJP state president Ravinder Raina on J&K assembly dissolvedpic

 The warlords visited the winning fronts and returned tiredly

 People are now seeking answers from the subedars
 is kahani ke paatr rahasyamay nahin hai
 In the government party, this anecdote is being heard again and again with different references
 gujarat se gorakhpur tak vaaya rajasthan, madhya pradesh satta virdohi taapmaana badaae laga he
 The sweat of the profession is spilling into the question
 soobedaar dilli talab hone lage hai
 So, resentment from the government surrounded the Digvijay BJP too! Nobody thought that people could be angry with their governments even after the grand victory of Lok Sabha elections till Gujarat, win over victory (except Bihar and Delhi)
 
 gujarat kii haar jaisi jeet or upachunaavon main bejod haar ke baad sarkaar main aise sawaal ghumad rahe hai jinka saamana haal ke varshon main kisi party ne nahin kiya
 Apparently, such continuous electoral victories were rare

 Of the 11 states in India (maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Kerala, Bihar, Odisha, and United Andhra), by 2020, seven of them will be 76% of the country's GDP
 Was in NDA) is ruled by BJP
 iske baad teen pramukh choti arthvyavasthaaen jharkhand, haryana or assam bhi bhaajapa ke niyantran main hai
 This was an occasion for which the UPA government yearned for ten years
 sudhaaron ke kai ahm prayog isi vajah se jameen nahin pakad sake kyonki bade or sansaadhan sampann rajyon se centre ke rajnatik rishton main garmjoshi nahin thi
 But can the chemistry of political relations between the Center and the states lead to the mission of the Modi government? Modi government is the first such government in the last decade that has flagged off programs and missions from 'cleanliness' to 'udaan' i
e
 from ground to sky, yet resentment has surrounded the governments! Why Modi did not live up to expectations Team India? 1
 rajyon main pehle se hi mukhyamantriyon ke paas khaasi takat thi
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pmo-centric political governance became the norm for states
 satta kaa vikendrikaran na hone se jamini kriyanvayan or samvaad jad nahin pakad sakaa jabaki duusari taraf ghoshnaaon kaa ambara laga diya gaya
 Now it's disillusionment
 udhaaharan ke liye gorakhpur

 rajyon kaa prashasnic dhaancha thak chukaa he
 It is much more drastic and needs new reforms
 lekin pichley chaar saal main kisi rajya main koi nayaa bada krantikari sudhaar yaa prayog najar nahin aayaa
 The termination of the Planning Commission did not benefit
 rajyon ke aarthik faislon main aazaadee milane kii bajaae nayaa skim raaj mila jise puraane dhaanche par lad diya gaya
 3
 pichley teen saal main rajyon kii vittiya sthiti bigadi he
 The consolidated deficit of the states is at the highest level of twelve years and market debt is ten years due to power losses, debt waiver and revenue reduction
 yah haalat chaudaaven vitt ayog se adhik sansaadhan milane ke baad he
 The failure of GST has further worsened the condition of the state exchequer
 centre va 20 rajyon or kareeb 60 fisadi jidipi par shashan ke baad bhi bhaajapa ko agar apni sarkaron se naaraazgi kaa dar he or kuch rajyon main soobedaaron kii tabdili ke jariye naaraazgi ko kam karne kii naubat aan padi he to maananaa chahie ki loktantr majboot ho rahaa he
 Outrage over governments is a testimony to the maturity of democracy
 gujarat se gorakhpur tak matadaata yah ehsaas karaane lage hai ki prayek chunavi jeet agali jeet kii guarantee nahin he
 Have people started to understand the difference between politics and government? If this is the case then it is to be remembered that the finger of these millions of unnamed people has the power to blush

 How much trouble did you buy your new smart phone
 doston ke phone dekhe, ishtehaaron par gaur kiya or internet par bhi maathaa-pachchi kii
 Went to buy the phone, then spent more than i thought
 ab phone to mast chalata he, lekin is kambakht bydaree kaa kya karen! puraa charge karke ghar se nikalate hai lekin suraj doobane se pehle betry doobane lagati he
 There is a fear that the phone will not stop in the middle
 agar smart phone istemaal karne vaale logon se poocha jaae ki apane phone ke bare main koun si cheez unhen sabase zyada naapsand he to zyaadaatar logon kaa jawaab hoga– betry
 Where has the technology of the phone reached in the last few years
 lekin afsos ki betry ke maamle main kuch khaas krantikari badlaav nahin hua
 The competition was done between companies, who could make such a slim phone
 patala sa phone sundar to khub dikhataa he lekin iskaa matlab ye bhi hota he ki phone main betry ke liye kam jagah bachegi
 Now how long will a slim battery be able to run a rocket-speed smart phone
 nateeja ye, ki aap har vakt charger lekar ghoomte najar aate hai
 We suggest some ways to make this problem easier for you
 ye ummid to mat karen ki in upayon se aapke smart phone kii betry, aapke puraane basic phone ke jitani chalane lagegi
 After all, how is it possible that you drive an SUV but expect the mileage of Maruti 800! But these measures will definitely reduce the risk of the phone being shut down before returning home
 jo upaay ham bataa rahen hai vaise to ve android phone ke hisaab se likhe gaye hai
 But most things apply to every phone - settings and steps may be different
 ham betry ko lanbaa chalaane ke 20 tips bataa rahe hai
 The initial tips are for those who have a new friendship with the new phone
 aage ke tips puraane or anbhavi yugers ke liye hai
 1
 phone kii screen kaa britaness ko kam karen–kisi bhi tach screen vaale smart phone main sabase zyada, kareeb aadhi betry, akele screen hi kharch kar daalati he
 The larger the screen, the brighter and the higher the resolution, the more power it needs
 agar aapke phone main screen britaness ke liye auto mod he to uskaa istemaal karen
 Otherwise keep the brightness around 50%
 isse aapaki aakhon par jor bhi kam padegaa or betry bhi kam kharch hogi
 You can increase the brightness for some time while watching a photo or video in special sunlight
 2
 Keep GPS, Blue tooth, wi-fi off - GPS (global Positioning System) will be used only occasionally
 lekin agar aap ise chaalu rakhte hai tab bhi betry bina baat teji se kharch hoti rahegi
 Similarly, turn on wi-fi only when you want to use it
 renj se baahar jaakar bhi vaai faai on rahaa to phone vaai- faai ke signal talashta rahegaa or betry jaati rahegi
 (settings >> Wireless Settings >> Wi Fi) 3
 phone ke wibrasion se tauba karen–ringtone kii aawaaj kii tulana main wibratt hone main phone ko kaaphi takat lagaani padati he
 So it is very important (like elderly people or when you are in a meeting) to use Vibration mode only, otherwise keep it disabled
 isi tarah 'shaike' yani phone ko hilaa kar actevet karne vaale fitures ko band hi rakhane main bhalaai he
 (settings >> Sound and Display >> Phone Vibrate) 4
 live walpaper kaa moh choden–phone ke screen par tairti hui machhlee, haule-haule hilte hue pattey jaise live wallpaper sundar to bahut lagate hai
 But understand that these are the biggest enemies of the battery
 iske bajaay kisi dark color ke photo ko walpaper bananaa acha hoga
 5
 screen time out kam karen –screen timeout kaa matlab he kuch nahin karne par screen kii lite kitni der baad apane aap of hogi
 The shorter the screen timeout, the longer the battery will run
 (settings>> Sound & display>>screen timeout)6
 Camera, video handling - When the phone battery is low, then use the camera and the video
 in donon chizon ko khub power chahie hoti hai
 When the phones start feeling hot, then it should be understood that the battery is going fast and needs rest
 7
 Close applications properly - New users make the same mistake the most
 home batan dabaane se aplications band nahin hote, sirf bekagranud main chale jate hai
 Out of sight, they drink the battery as well as the phone's memory
 aplications band karne ke liye tab tak back batan dabaaten rahen jab tak App se baahar na nikal jaaen
 Or use the Exit button
 8
 Don't download unnecessary apps - Millions of apps are available for free download, it doesn't mean that you make your phone a garbage can of apps
 jin Apps ko aap istemaal nahin karte hai or jinase aapkaa man bhar chukaa he unhen phone se hataa den
 9
 betry yuj kaa pataa lagaaein–phone kii settings main jaakar (settings >> About phone>>battery Use) ye dekhen kii koun si aplicoshan kitni betry kharch kar rahi he
 If an unused application is consuming more battery, then either remove it from the phone)
 agar aise jagah par hai jahaan mobile kaa signal nahin aa rahaa he – jaise hawaii jahaaj – to phone of kar len yaa use Flight Mode main kar len
 Otherwise the phone will continue to search for signals
 10
 Check 2G-3G Mode - Is it not that you have not taken 3G plan from mobile company and your phone is running on GSM / WCDMA (auto Mode)
 phone kis mod par chal rahaa he check karne ke liye (settings >>more settings>>mobile networks>>network mode>>gsm Only) par jaaen or agar 3G istemaal nahin kar rahen hon to ise 2G yani GSM Only mod par laaen
 Go to a place where there is no 3G service, remember to go to GSM Only mode or else the phone will continue to burn the battery to find 3G signal
 11
 Get rid of widgets - Widgets are larger-than-normal icons that occupy more space on your phone screen
 jaise mausam kaa haal bataane vaale, yaa phir fasebuk or twitor ke vijets
 Automatic update widgets not only blow up the battery but also continuously increase the internet bill
 phone ke home screen par Apps ke aickens kii bheed na lagaaein
 Do not put apps which are used occasionally, but open them by going inside the menu
 12
 Use the inbuilt power saver of the phone - if your phone already has power saving mode, then keep it turned on
 ye kam betry hone par screen briness ko kam karata he or kuch kam jaruri applications ko band karke betry bachaane kii koshish karata he
 But downloading battery saving apps from the play store is not a good idea
 betry seaving Apps behad vivaad kaa vishay hai or bahut se visheshgy maanate hai ki ye App jitani betry bachaate hai utani khud us App ko chalaane main kharch ho jaati he
 13
 lokation services ko of rakhen–iske liye (settings>> Locations Services) main jaakar sabhi box se tik mark hataa den
 If you have location services, then you keep spending the battery in the process of tracking your phone's locality while constantly working on it
 khaas taur par jeepies to bahut betry phoonkata he
 If needed, you can turn on the location service for a while
 14
 Do not let apps get auto-updated - all the apps on Android phones keep updating on the day it comes
 vakt-bevakt eps apadet aapaki betry or data chargeej donon ke liye baari padenge
 To turn off auto update, go to (menu >> Play Store >> Settings >> Auto –update apps) and set it to Do not auto update
 hafte main kam se kam ek baar (menu>> Play Store>> My Apps) par jaakar apane eps ko menuali apadet jarur kar len
 15
 Apps kaa Sync Interval kam karen–kabhi dhyaan diya he ki aapke phone main kitni services lagaataar chalati rahati hai – yani Sync hoti rahati hai
 Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Office Mail, Google Plus
 
 
 ye sab betry bhi leti hai or data bhi
 If you cannot close them, then go to the settings of these apps and reduce the Sync Interval
 ho sake to fasebuk or tamaam aisi chizon ke liye App downlod ke bajaay browsar main bukmarks bana kar use istemaal karen
 16
 phaltu eps ko Uninstall yaa Disable karen –downlod kiye gairajaruri Apps ko Uninstall karnaa to aasaan he
 But what to do with their useless apps which were already present in the phone but you never use them
 android ke 4
 Disable the app in 0 and above versions
 (settings>> Application manager>>all) par jaaen
 Open apps you never use and press the Disable button
 agar Disable karne kaa option nahin dikh rahaa he to pehle uske saare Updates ko Uninstall karen
 After that try disable again
 dhyaan rahen jin sarvice ko aap nahin samaj paa rahen unhen Disable nahin karen varna phone main kuch gadabad ho sakati he
 17
 Firmware Update karen –check karen ki kya aapke phone main uske liye uplabdh sabase letest Firmware he yaa nahin
 If it is not, update it
 kuch phone to OTA (over The Air) Firmware Update kar lete hai 
 But to update the firmware in many phones, you will have to connect it to a computer or seek the help of a service center
 Firmware Update ke baad agar betry teji se ja rahi he to aapako apana External Memory Card yani SD Card ko ek baar Format karnaa hoga
 The task is a bit difficult but Firmware Update makes your phone as fast as new and also brings many new features
 18
 Use black if you have an AMOLED screen - remember if your phone screen is AMOLED, black should be your favorite color
 walpevar se lekar browsar ke bekagranud color main aap kaale rang kaa jitna istemaal karengen betry utani lambii chalegi
 19
 do antiwoiras kaa istemaal nahin karen –kuch log sochate hai ki do antiworas unke phone ko zyada surakshit bana degaa
 But this is not the case - it will make your phone sluggish and the battery will also keep going
 20
 Turn off animation - If battery is the most important thing for you, then turn off animation in all applications
 style jaraa kam ho jayega lekin betry lif bad jaaegi
 Go to (settings >> Developer Options >> Drawing), either turn off all animations or reduce Animation Scale
 lo betry kii vajah se phone ekadam band hone vaala ho or charge karnaa sambhav nahin ho to Mobile Data Off kar len
 The phone will continue to operate, just the services connected to the internet will not work
 gangs of vasepur main apni acting se sabakaa dhyaan khinchne vaale navazuddin siddiki in dinon kuch naraj hai
 The reason for this is none other than Bipasha Basubat
 yah naaraazgi personal nahin balki profeshnal he jiskaa zikr navazuddin ne dabi jubaan main kiya he
 Nawazuddin is also in awe of the fact that his title role has been closely watched ever since the news of his pairing with the Suparna Verma-directed film Soul Menhot Bipasha Basuke came to the media
 navazuddin kehete hai ki yah vaaki bahut ajeeb baat he ki aatma main mere tital role kii itani charchaa he
 i have also played the title role in Mangaungs of Wasseypur before this
 uski to koi charchaa nahin kar rahaa
 i am still the same as before
 logon ko mujh main bhale hi badlaav dikhe lekin mujhe khud main koi badlaav nazar nahin aa rahaa
 Nawaz has a point in you, but like others, you cannot escape the magic of Bipasha

 iske saath hi tata motors kii is car se sabase sasti car kaa tag bhi hat jayega
 The company is going to add many new features to the new model with the intention of attracting first-time car buyers and removing the price of the cheapest car

 anya khoobiyon ke alaava janeex naino main automatic minial transmishan, openable boot tathaa bluetooth phone sinc audio pranali tathaa anya khoobiyon kaa samavesh hoga
 genx Nano will be launched in the next six-seven weeks
 iske baad naino kii maujuuda varjan ko dhire dhire hataaya jayega
 However, only the CNG version will be retained
 tata motors ke varisht upaadhyaksh girish vaagh ne is brands ko samaapt kiye jane kii atakalon ko khaarij kar diya
 He said that Nano is a very important product of the company
 input: bhashaa Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar said that if there is a terrorist attack on the country like Pathankot, it should be treated like a fight
 vahiin grih mantri rajnath singh ne kaha ki abhi tak sarkaar pakke taur par kah paane kii sthiti main nahin he ki aatanki kis raste hokar aaye the
 The two ministers said that there was no lack of cohesion and coordination among the security forces there
 enesji ke bheje jane ko bhi sahi tehraaya kyonki agar aatanki vahaan base par rah rahe teen pariwaron ko bandhak bana lete to enesji ko aise maamalon se nipatane main maharath hasil he
 Both said that this operation lasted only 43 hours and not three or four days
 donon kendriya mantriyon ne ye baat loksabhaa main charchaa ke dauraan kahi
 The comments niyam 193 ke tahat loksabhaa main pathankot airbase par hue aatanki hamale se upje halaat ke dauraan in mantriyon ne apni baat rakhi
 However, the opposition was not satisfied with his reply
 khaskar congress ke netaa jyotiraditya sindhiya ne kaha ki aatanki hamale ke dhai maheene baad jab sarkaar ko ye nahin pataa ki aatanki kis raste se aaye the to phir ham unke jabaab se kaise santusht ho sakate hai
 The Opposition targeted the national security advisory on the pretext and said that when the input of terrorists was already received, then how did the terrorists enter the base
 gauratlab he ki ek janvari ko aatankiyon ne pathankot main bhartiya vayusena ke base par hamalaa kar suraksha balon ke 7 javaanon ko shahid kar diya tha
 All six terrorists were killed in retaliatory attacks
 donon mantriyon ne kaha ki vahaan par suraksha balon main saamanjasy or talmail main koi kami nahin thi
 The sending of the NSG was also justified because if the terrorists had taken three families living on the base as hostages, then the NSG has the expertise in handling such cases
 donon ne kaha ki ye oparation keval 43 ghanta chalaa naa ki teen yaa chaar din
 The two Union Ministers said this during the discussion in the Lok Sabha
 tippaniyan Under Rule 193, these ministers gave their views during the situation arising out of the terrorist attack on Pathankot airbase in Lok Sabha
 haalanki inke jawaab se vipaksh santusht nahin hua
 Especially Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia said that after two and a half months after the terror attack, the government does not know from which way the terrorists came, then how can we be satisfied with their reply
 vipaksh ne isi bahaane rashtriya suraksha salahakaar par nishaanaa saadhaa or kaha ki pehle se jab aatankiyon ke input mil gaya tha to phir kaise aatanki base main daakhil ho gaye
 Significantly, on January 1, the terrorists attacked the Indian Air Force base in Pathankot and killed 7 security forces personnel
 javaabi hamale main sabhi chah aatanki maare gaye

 assam main congress sarkaar ke shanti or vikaas ke agenda ko rekhaankit karte hue sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) evam party adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne guwahati main shanivaar ko ugravadi sanghathanon se centre sarkaar kii shanti kii pahal main shaamil hone kii apil kii
 Sonia arrived here despite the proclamation of the anti-peace negotiation group led by Paresh Barua of the militant group ULFA (united Liberation Front of Assam)
 band kaa elaan unke daure ke virodh main kiya gaya he
 The same group had detonated a bomb in Tinsukia district on Friday night, in which one person was killed
 sonia ne kade suraksha prabandhon ke bich yahaan ke sarusojaai stadium main jansabha ko sambodhit kiya
 The ceremony was organized at the stadium on the first anniversary of the government in the state
 congress yahaan lagaataar teesri baar satta main ai he
 Sonia said, 'I am very happy to be here today
 yah bahut sukhad avasar he kyonki congress ke netritv main lagaataar teesri baar gathit sarkaar ne ek saal puraa kar liya he
 He said that this is a sign that the policies of the government have been able to win the trust of the people of the state
 logon ke vishwaas ne sarkaar kii jimmedaariyaan badha di hai
 Sonia said, "most militant organizations have agreed that violence is not going to solve their problems
" main ummid karti hum ki jo log shanti samjhaute se abhi tak duuri banaae hue hai, ve bhi centre sarkaar kii shanti pahal main bahut jald shaamil ho jaaenge
 He said, "you all know that when the Congress government was formed in 2001 under the leadership of Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, the state of the state was extremely miserable
 sarkari karmchaariyon ko vetan nahin mil rahaa tha
 There were no roads, no rural development programs and industries
 kanoon evam vyavastha kii samasya ke chalate vyavsaayee rajya ko chhodane lage the
 Today i am very happy to see the changed picture here
 'congress adhyaksh ne kaha, 'lagbhag 27 varsh pehle purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ne rajya ke vikaas ke liye aitihaasik assam samjhaute par hastakshar kiye the
 The present government is continuously working as per the instructions of the Assam Accord to take the state towards development
 ' unhone kaha, 'yah maujuuda sarkaar ke nirantar prayaason kaa hi parinaam he ki rajya ne vikaas ke maamle main kai uplabdhiyaan hasil karne main sakasham rahi he
 Assam has created history in the country by producing a record of food grains
 chaay udyog ko assam main congress shashan ke pichley 11 varshon ke dauraan aaajeevan patta mila he
 Assam is the first state where free commuters have been provided to students of high schools
 ' sonia ne kaha, 'rajya ke logon ne sarkaar ko harasambhav sahyog diya he or congress sarkaar assam ko desh ke viksit evam shantipurna rajyon main se ek banane kii prakriya main logon ko kabhi niraash nahin hone degi
 ' kendra sarkaar ne supreme court main daawa kiya ki media main prasaarit kiye gaye ‘radia tepe’ main jodtod kii gai thi or record kii gai in telephone vaartaon ke tepe ke li ke liye kaai sarkari agency jimmedaar nahin he
 The comments udyogpati ratan tata kii yachika par sunwaayee kar rahi nyaayamuti ji es singhvi kii adhyakshata vaali khandpeeth ke samaksh daakhil moharband gopneey report main sarkaar ne tap kii gai telephone vaartaon ke prasaarit anshon ke bare main ye daawey kiye he
 The report said that eight to ten agencies, including telecom service provider companies, were involved in taping telephone conversations of Neera Radia, who was lobbying for companies at the time
 maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi khandpeeth ne sarkaar kii is rapat ke kuch shuruaati prishthon ko dekha he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki media main prasaarit vaarta ke tepon main jod ghataav kiye gaye hai
 Citing the report, Justice Singhvi said that the opening and final parts of the conversation did not match the original tape
 unhone kaha ki report main yah bhi daawa kiya gaya he ki jo sarkari adhikari maamle kii jaanch se jude the unhen jaankaree nahin he ki ye tepe kisne li kiye
 "it is possible that someone else has done this," the bench said
 ’’ In a sealed confidential report filed before a bench headed by Justice GS Singhvi, hearing the petition of industrialist Ratan Tata, the government has made these claims regarding the excerpts of the taped telephone conversations
 report main kaha gaya he ki us samay companiyon ke liye lobing kaa kaam karne vaali nira radia kii telephone baatcheet tap (bich main record) karne main doorsanchaar seva pradaata companiyon samet aath se das agenciyaan shaamil thim
 The bench hearing the case looked at some of the opening pages of the government's report, stating that the additions to the tapes of the talks circulated in the media have been subtracted

 jammu-kashmir main suraksha balon par aatanki hamale rukne kaa naam nahin le rahe hai
 On Friday, the terrorists once again launched a grenade attack in the Kashmir Valley
 yah pichley 24 ghante main kashmir ghati main teesraa aatanki grenade hamalaa he
 On Friday, terrorists targeted security forces near Ghantaghar Lal Chowk in Srinagar and in Shopian

 ASI Iqbal Singh is posted in 14 battalions of Jammu and Kashmir Armed Police
 guuruuvaar ke grenade hamale main unke donon pairon main chot ai
 The attack caused injuries to traffic policeman Harish Manzoor's back part and Sanaullah's right leg
 shuukravaar ko aatankiyon ne pehla hamalaa srinagar ke laal chowk ke najadik suraksha balon ko nishaanaa banaakar kiya, jabaki doosraa hamalaa dakshin kashmir ke shopiyaan main police camp par kiya
 These grenade attacks damaged vehicles and shops around the security forces
 haalanki in taaja hamale main abhi tak kisi ke hataahat hone kii khabar nahi hai
 Two incidents of # grenadeattack by # terrorists; one in # Srinagar & other in # Shopian
 # Policeis at the spot
 Investigation in both incidents is going on
 No loss of life or property reported
 @ jmukmrpolice — Kashmir Zone Police (@kashmirpolice) January 18, 2019 After this grenade attack, security forces have cordoned off the area and started searching for suspected terrorists
 philhal in aatanki hamalon kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 At the same time, it is not clear yet which terrorist organization is behind these three attacks
 haalanki buudhvaar ko khufia agenciyon ne jaish-e-mohammad ke aatankwaadi dwaara fidaayin hamale kiye jane kaa hai alert jari kiya tha
 The attack that took place on Thursday is one kilometer from Clock tower Lal Chowk
 pichley 24 ghante main kashmir ghati main 3 grenade hamale us samay saamne aae hai, jab khufia vibhaag ne aatanki hamalon ke lekar hai alert jari kiya he
 On Wednesday, intelligence agencies had asked security personnel to be on high alert regarding terrorist attacks in Kashmir
 suraksha balon se yah bhi kaha gaya tha ki wo kashmir ghati ke sabhi ilaakon main puri tarah se mustaid rahen
 Intelligence agencies had said in their report that jaish-e-mohammed's fidayeen terrorists may attack the bases of the security forces
 ye aatanki IED or anya visphotakon se las hai
 Jaish-fidayeen terrorists may also open fire at security checkpoints
 is khufia alert ke baad kashmir main aatankiyon ke mansoobon ko naakaam karne ke liye kendriya sashastr police balon kii kareeb 500 atirikt companiyon ko bhi tainaat kiya gaya he
 Earlier on Army Day, Chief of Army Staff General Bipin Rawat had said that the terrorists have been severely harmed in the military operation in the Kashmir Valley
 unhone saaf kaha tha ki desh kii suraksha ke saath kisi bhi tarah kaa koi samjhauta nahin kiya jayega
 Let us tell you that the terrorists are buoyed by the action of the security forces in the Kashmir Valley and are constantly targeting the security forces and their targets
 bhartiya cricket team twanti-20 vishwa cap ke group-2 ke apane duusare mukaable main ravivaar ko chir pratidwandvi pakistan ke saamne hogi
 The Indian team, who suffered a humiliating defeat in their first Super-8 match against Australia, will have to win the match to stay in the race
 pakistan kii sthiti bharat se bahut acchhee he
 Ready for the 'do or die' match, India have won their first match in Super-8 and are currently second in the table after Australia
 pakistan ke haathon haarane vaali dakshin africa team behatar ran rate ke aadhaar par tisare sthaan par he jabaki sabase kharaab ran rate ke saath bharat chauthe sthaan par he
 Pakistan's side is looking heavy at the moment as they defeated India in a World Cup practice match
 sangyojan ke lihaaj se bhi pakistani team is samay behatar sthiti main dikhaai de rahi he
 'nawab of Najafgarh', he has good bowlers and quality batsmen, while India certainly has good batsmen and many spinners but they have not been able to do justice to their talent in any other match except England
 australia ke khilaaf mili sharmnaak haar ne bhartiya ranneetikaron ko apane faislon par manthan ko majaboor kiya he lekin bhartiya team kii sabase badi samasya aaj bhi team sangyojan hi bana hua he
 T20 World Cup: Australia has beaten India by 9 wickets, and the cricket has been a victim of internal politics, but nobody has ever made the mistake of taking the Pakistani team lightly
 jaahir he, bharat bhi aisa galati nahin karegaa or aisi sthiti main to bilkul bhi nahin, jab abhyaas match main use haar mil chuki he
 Pakistan may not have as many capable batsmen as India, but its batsmen have the ability to decimate India's weak attack line and then expert Twenty20 bowlers like Umar Gul and Sohail Tanvir make this team's attack line the most capable
 aise main bharat ko apane khel kaa str uthaanaa hoga kyonki is baar agar koi galati hui to phir dhoni kii team kaa 2007 kii safalataa ko dohraane kaa sapana tut jayega
 To defeat Pakistan, India will have to show a balanced game in every sense, but before that the captain has to choose a balanced team, which can meet the needs
 aisa lag rahaa he ki tigmanshu dhulia kaa jaadu kamjor ho gaya he
 Mahsuur Tigmanshu Dhulia has brought Milan Talkies this time for two tremendous films in Saheb Biwi Gangster series and a revenge drama like Bullet Raja
 tigmanshu kii pichhali film sahab bivi gangster 3 flop thi
 Let's know what kind of film Tigmanshu's Milan Talkies is
 kahanianu (ali fazal) naam kaa ek ladkaa bada film nirdeshak banane kaa sapana dekhtaa he
 But there are all kinds of struggles in her caste life
 wo choti-moti filmein banaakar apana guzaara kar rahaa he
 Along with this he is also running a racket with some friends
 ye racket pariksha main nakal karwaane kaa kaam karata he
 Janardhan (ashutosh Rana) has to pass his daughter Maithli (shraddha Srinath) in the BA examination
 is kaam ke liye janardan, anu kii madad letaa he
 It is from here that Anu comes in contact with Maithli and the love story of the two climbs
 lekin matholi ke pita janardan ko ye rishta manjuur nahin
 Actually, he wants to get his daughter married to another boy
 kahani main twist yaheen se shuru hota he or dekhne ko milti he pyaar kii agni pariksha
 Is Anu able to gain Maithli's love, does the two split, how does Janardhana stop Anu? To know all these things how Anu faces Janardhana, one has to go to see Tigmanshu Dhulia's film
 jaahir si baat he ki milan tokies kii kahani main kuch nayaa nahin he
 Plots of such stories have come before us many times
 isamen koi nayaa treetment bhi najar nahin aata
 From above, there are speed breakers in many places in the film's story
 is vajah se ye kamjor gati se aage badhati he
 By the end, all things start to get boring
 haalanki film ke pehle half main kahani ko lekar kuch rochakata he
 But in the second half, the entire film seems derailed
 kah sakate hai milan tokies kii kahani bikharaav kaa shikaar ho gai he
 Acting Now if the foundation of a film is weak, what can good artists do in it
 milan tokies kii star cast behtareen he
 Due to lack of strength in the story, no artist has been able to do justice to his character
 anu ke rup main ali fazal kaa kaam ausat hi kaha jayega
 He has tried his side, but he is unable to connect with the audience due to all kinds of scattering
 bade parde par apana padaarpan kar raheen shraddha shrinath ne jarur kuch had tak prabhavit kiya he
 He also danced in the film, gave intense scenes and also did a lot of drama
 dikkat yah hui ki unke kirdaar main gaharaai hi nahin he
 There is also a lack of stagnation
 screen par unki chemistry ali ke saath jachin he, lekin kahani kii vajah se donon ke paas darshakon ko baandh kar rakhane ke liye kuch bhi nahin he
 Looking at Ashutosh Rana's abilities, it seems that the Milan Talkies were not for him
 unka kirdaar bilkul bhi vishwasaneey nahin laga
 By the way, if this film had come 20 years ago, people would have believed in its story and characters
 film main sanjay mishra kaa bhi chota role he
 But they also do not look special
 is romantic kahani main ek villen bhi hai
 Sikander Kher has played this character
 lekin screen par wo beasar najar aae hai
 By the way, if anyone sees a smile on their face in this film, they are Tigmanshu Dhulia
 tigmanshu ne film main acting bhi kii he
 He plays Anu's father
 unki comic timming or panches sateek hai
 The character of the rest of the cast in the film is not very developed
 nirdeshnatigmanshu dhulia ne milan tokies ke saath ek shuddh desi romantic film banane kii koshish kii he
 But seeing this, it can be said that they have failed badly
 ye film aaj ke darshakon ko hajam ho hi nahin sakati
 Tigmanshu insisted that Anu loves Maithili
 lekin puri film main ye nahin bataaya kii matholi ke pita unke rishte ko sweekaar kyon nahin karte hai
 This aspect stops until the end
 film kii length bhi samaj se pare he
 The climax is also disappointing and many things are already known
 musecmilan tokies ke gane bhi yaad kiye jane laayak nahin hai
 In the entire film, only Sonu Nigam's 'bet' song gives a little relief
 becoground score bhi bahut ausat he or kisi bhi seen ko zyada prabhavi nahin banaata
 If you are fond of watching romantic movies, then avoid watching Milan Talkies
 tigmanshu is film ke jariye box offis par koi ummid nahin kar sakate
 a major accident has occurred due to the collapse of a bridge in Odisha

 The five-month-old Shibu Soren government, which came in a minority due to withdrawal of support by BJP and NDA constituent JDU under fast-changing political developments in Jharkhand on Monday, was given a week by Governor moh Farooq to prove his majority in the Assembly 
 jhamumo vidhayak dal ke netaa or mukhyamantri shibu sorain ke putr hemanth sorain ne rajyapal se shibu sorain kii somvaar shaam hui mulaakaat ke baad samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya ki sorain ne rajyapal se bahumat sabit karne ke liye ek saptaah kaa samay maanga or rajyapal ne unhen yah samay dete hue bahumat siddh karne ke liye 31 may kaa din nirdhaarit kiya
 With the withdrawal of support by two BJP and JDU mlas, the Soren government now has the support of just 25 mlas in the 82-member assembly
 jharkhand vidhansabha main jhamumo ke 18, congress ke 14, jharkhand vikaas morcha ke 11 or rajd ke paanch vidhayak hai
 One member is nominated while the other legislators number 8

 He said that his party has held talks with the Congress, but will not be disclosed yet

 rajyapal ne kaha ki vah samarthan vaapasi ke bhaajapa ke patr par vichaar karenge or rajya kii raajnneetik sthiti kii samiksha karne ke baad hi koi nirnay karenge
 Asked if he would call Chief Minister Soren to meet him, the Governor said that nothing could be said about this at the moment, only after consulting legal experts, he would decide about it
 samarthan vaapasi ke baad bhaajapa vidhayak dal ke netaa das ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki unhone rajya sarkaar se party ke sabhi 18 vidhayakon ke samarthan waapas lene sambandhi patr rajyapal ko saunp diya
 Now the governor has to decide the future of the state

 He blamed the Congress for the political instability of the state and said that the Congress had created a similar situation in Jharkhand in 2005 and toppled the bjp-led government led by Arjun Munda and formed a puppet government led by Madhu Koda
 
 bhaajapa ke samarthan waapas lene ke turant baad jadyu ne bhi rajya sarkaar se samarthan vaapasi kii ghoshnaa kar di
 JDU spokesperson Pramod Mishra said that JDU is a party with principles and has an alliance with BJP at the national level
 bhaajapa dwaara jhamumo ke netritv vaali rajya sarkaar se samarthan vaapasi ke faisle ke baad jadyu ne bhi is sarkaar se samarthan waapas lene kaa nirnay liya he
 He informed that both the party mlas Sudha Chaudhary and Gopal Krishna Patar will hand over the letter of withdrawal of support to the Governor within a day or two
 beeti 18 may ko mukhyamantri sorain or sarkaar main sheersh pad ke liye bhaajapa ke daavedaar munda ne sanyukt samvaadadaata sammelan kar ghoshnaa kii thi ki donon dalon ke bich is baat par sahmati bani he ki donon 28-28 maheene ke liye baari-baari se satta sanbhaalenge
 It was also decided that in the first 28 months Munda would form the government and in the subsequent 28 months the JMM would take power
 lekin is aapasi sahmati ke duusare hi din sorain ne alag tarah ke bayaan diye, jiske baad bhaajapa samarthan waapas lene ke bare main vichaar karne lagi
 Political analysts believe that Soren has given these statements very thoughtfully

 In the political riots between the BJP and JMM (jharkhand Mukti Morcha) in the state, the war of words is now crossing its border
 dumka main jeemem ke 39wein sthapana diwas samaaroh ke maukey par party ke kaaryakari adhyaksh hemanth sorain ne bijepi ko rakshas kii sangya dete hue kaha ki bijepi ek rakshas kii tarah dilli se lekar dhire-dhire puure desh main kabja jamaa rahi he or desh kii swatantra agenciyon se lekar loktantr ke sabhi stambhon ko apni jeb main kar liya he
 At the same time, BJP accused Hemant Soren of corruption and said that Hemant has done money laundering with the help of many cell companies
 santhalpargana se hua elaan-e-jangdumka ke aitihaasik gandhi maidan main hue vishaal jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue purv mukhyamantri or jeemem ke kaaryakari adhyaksh hemanth sorain ne centre sarkaar se lekar rajya sarkaar ko apane nishane par rakhaa
 Comparing party leader Hemant Soren, the NBJP, to a demon, the people in this country now find it difficult to get justice because all the independent agencies of the country are following the bjp's signals
 aise main janata ko nyaay ke liye ab jan adaalat main janaa hoga
 He also questioned the tribal and Dalit love of the BJP
 bijepi kaa palatwargeememke aaropon ko sire se khaarij karte hue bijepi ke vidhayak ram kumaar paahan ne aarope lagaaya ki hemanth sorain ravi kejariwal naam ke ek vyakti kii aad main kai cell companiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 With the help of these companies they have done money laundering
 bataaya jaataa he ki ravi kejariwal kabhi sabhaaon main laudspikar lagane kaa kaam kiya karata tha
 Later, after coming in contact with Shibu Soren, luck suddenly reversed and he started playing in crores
 aarope he ki shibu sorain ke charam ke dinon main kejariwal parivaar ko shibu parivaar ke liye paisa banane se lekar paisa khapaane tak kaa jimmaa tha
 During this period, Manohar Pal, close to Ravi Kejriwal family, became the emergency secretary of Shibu Soren
 inke aapt sachiv banane ke baad kaha jane laga ki sorain parivaar raajnneeti karti thi or baaki kaa sara kaam prayag kejariwal or manohar paal ke jimme tha
 Later Manohar Pal started his business and became the owner of Samridhi Steel

 In the battle between the restless JMM and the ruling BJP, all the arrows of quiver are being tried in Santhaljharkhand, the stronghold of JMM
 darasal bijepi jahaan aapasi antardvand main uljhi he vahiin jeemem hamalavar he
 By the way, Santhal Pargana is traditionally considered a stronghold of JMM
 aise main jeemem ne dumka main vishaal jansabha kaa aayojan kar bijepi ko gherne kii ranneeti par kaam karnaa shuru kar diya he
 The young Dalit leader Chandrashekhar Azad alias Ravana may not appear to oppose Mayawati, but the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati probably feels threatened by her presence
 mayawati ne sidhe-sidhe bhim army ke agua chandrashekhar ko bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kaa guptchar ghoshit kar diya he
 On the announcement of Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar to contest from Banaras, Mayawati targeted the BJP and said, "in order to benefit the BJP by dividing the votes of Dalits, BJP is contesting Chandrashekhar of Bhim Army from Varanasi Lok Sabha seat
 "
 mayawati ne apane hamale main chandrashekhar ko bhaajapa kaa guptchar bataaya or kaha ki daliton ke vot baantne ke makasad se hi bhaajapa chandrashekhar ko chunaav ladava rahi he
 Mayawati has also alleged that the Bhima Army has been built by the BJP
 mayawati kaa aarope he ki bhaajapa ne guptchari karne ke liye pehle chandrasekhar ko basapa main bhejne kii koshish kii
 Mayawati's statement about Chandrashekhar is not the first time
 isse pehle bhi unhone chandrashekhar se kisi bhi tarah kaa raajnneetik rishta rakhane se inkaar kiya tha
 So did Mayawati and BSP going through bad times did not need political life? Shouldn't the BSP want an energetic leader like Chandrashekhar getting the names? Does Mayawati also want to hand over the treasures of her politics inherited from Kanshi Ram to her family like the rest of the dynasty, or has she seen a rival and a threat rather than her heir in Chandrasekhar
 si voter main ellection or media research ke senior faillo or raajnneetik tippaneekar devendra shukla is ghatana ko aise samajhaate hai, "uttar pradesh main daliton kii aabaadi lagbhag 21% se 23% he
 This society of Dalits is divided into two parts
 ek, jatav jinaki aabaadi kareeb 14% he or jo mayawati kii birdari hai
 Chandrasekhar is also a Jatava
 to mayawati kaa darana lajimi he
 In the Mandal movement, the BSP became stronger due to the politics of the Jatav vote of Dalits
 thik vaise hi jaise obisi main yadavon ke samarthan se sapa
 The Dalit, OBC and Muslim Congress had votes till the Mandal movement
 par yah in donon partiyon main bant gaye
 non-jatav votes constitute around 8% of the population
 inamen 50-60 jatiyaan or up-jatiyaan hai or yah vot vibhajit hota he
 "this divided vote sometimes gives strength to BJP and sometimes to Congress
 to phir mayawati ne basapa ke kaaryakartaaon ko chandrashekhar se bachakar rahane kii salaah kyon di thi? pichley teen chunaavon main haar kaa munh dekh rahi or lagaataar vot share or aadhaar main chhijan se mayawati paar paane ke liye chir shatru party samaajawaadee party se haath milaane ko to taiyaar hai par chandrashekhar jaise netaaon se duuri kyon banaae rakh rahi hai?shukla yaad dilaate hai, "is baar chandrashekhar ko jail se baahar bhaajapa laai lekin use congress le udi
 BJP is the main rival to Mayawati
 jatav voton main vibhaajan rokane ke liye mayawati ne chandrashekhar ko bhaajapa kaa agent bataaya
 Because if she had called him an agent of the Congress, the Dalits would have united in favor of the Congress
 dalit congress ke khilaaf nahin rahe kabhi
 "so, is Mayawati's past coming in the way of keeping distance from Chandrasekhar? Mayawati had to do a lot to control the BSP after Kanshi Ram
 kyon mayawati ne basapa main duusari paant kaa koi netaa nahi taiyaar hone diya? kyon jis bhi netaa kaa kad bada hota gaya, vah basapa main tik nahin paaya?kya vajah rahi he ki basapa se bisek bade netaa baahar kiye ja chuke hai? mayawati kisase hameshaa ashankit rahati hai? jawaab ek hi haih asuraksha
 Mayawati's BSP has no number two
 netritv kii duusari paant nahin he
 If Mayawati is keeping distance from the Congress, then the same thinking behind her is that no one should make a dent in her Dalit vote bank, which was almost 19 percent even when her party was cipher in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 yah kaam congress kar sakati he
 In particular, since Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has openly entered the electoral fray, Mayawati has intensified her attack on the Congress as Mayawati's Dalit SP cannot make a dent in the vote bank
 par congress kii taraf se aisi ashanka unhen hameshaa salti rahati he
 Along with this, he has the same fear from BJP
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main dalit vot bhaajapa kii taraf bhi muda tha or 2014 main bhi uttar pradesh main yah hua tha
 So is this the reason that despite sp's Akhilesh Yadav's wish, Mayawati has been reluctant to tie up with the Congress in Uttar Pradesh
 garibon ke liye nunatam aay yojana par bhi mayawati twit ke jariye hamale kar rahi hai
 Mayawati has also questioned the Congress's claim to alleviate poverty by giving money
 asal main sapa-basapa gathjod ke peeche sefology kaa ek siddhant kaam kar rahaa he jise index of apojishan unity (vipakshi dalon main ekta / bikharaav kaa suchakank) kaha jaataa he
 The more scattered the opposition parties, the lower the IOU
 yani kisi seat par trikoniya sangharsh ho to vijeta dal ko ek tihaai vot hi chahie honge
 But with the arrival of the Congress, the math has deteriorated and Mayawati fears that the Congress may not claim her vote bank
 shukla kehete hai, bhaajapa ko gherne se kya hoga? chandrashekhar ke bahaane bhale hi nishaanaa bhaajapa par ho par aakhri phayda bhaajapa ko hoga or nuksaan basapa ko
 He further explains, "the encircling of the upper caste BJP will unite the Dalit and Muslim votes in the reserved seats of 17 Scheduled Castes
 lekin isse saamaanya siton par savarna vot khisak jayega
 If polarization happens the BSP will suffer the most
 ”he adds together, the BSP does not win elections on all reserved seats
 use hameshaa aisi siton par jeet mili he jahaan dalit aabaadi adhik ho par vah seat arakshit na ho
 The Dalit population throngs there and votes for the BSP
 jaankaron kii maane, to basapa supremeo kaa yah ravaiya aakhirkaar bhaajapa kii ummiido ko paravaan degaa or napha bhaajapa ko hi milegaa

 Similarly, when Modi visited Lahore in December 2015, he met Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in the same manner

 Here a man had to beat his wife with a stick

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ravivaar ko apana 68waan janmdin manaaya
 On Modi's birthday, celebrities from all over the country sent him wishes and many events were held in different places, but the gift that the farmers of Andhra Pradesh sent to PM Modi on this occasion is less gift and more of an idea to make PM aware of his pain

 darasal andhra pradesh ke kisaanon ne piem modi ko unke janmdin ke maukey par 68 paise ke check bheje
 According to the news, the farmers sent these checks in the name of debt waiver in protest against the joke happening with them
 andhra pradesh ke roilseema saguniti sadhana samiti (aresases) ne kisaanon kii taraf se hajaaron check ikatthe kiye, ye check 68 paise ke the
 This committee sent these checks to draw attention of the government towards the plight of farmers

 He hopes that after this move, the government's attention will go to his problems and Modi will announce a special grant for good irrigation system for the farmers

 This time in the Gujarat elections, the Congress is playing the card of 'soft Hindutva' thoughtfully and does not want to be disturbed by this strategy
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi khud bhi is line par date dikhte hai
 In the first two visits of the state in view of the Gujarat elections, Rahul was seen visiting many temples and he also performed aarti in Navdurga pandals
 isi silsile main 1 november se rahul ne gujarat kaa phir daura shuru kiya to unhone apane andaaj se saaf kar diya ki chaahe ilaaka alpsankhyak bahul hi kyon naa ho, ve ‘soft hindutv’ kii line ko pakade rakhenge
 On Wednesday, Rahul started the three-day tour from Jambusar in Bharuch district
 ye ilaaka alpsankhyak bahut mana jaataa he
 Even before Rahul arrived, the rally venue was seen to be full
 ek najar main hi pataa chal rahaa tha ki badi sankhya main alpsankhyak bhi rahul ko sunne aae the
 The Congress feared that this election of Gujarat would not go on the communal line and that it would be lost due to polarization
 lekin saath hi congress ke liye ye bhi sawaal tha ki puri tarah alpsankhyak ilaake ko bina prachaar kaise chhod de
 In the same struggle, the party devised a way
 tay hua ki rahul is ilaake main sirf ek raily or ek road sho karenge
 As soon as Rahul reached the stage in Jambusar, it was announced that the saint Mahant of the area would first offer prayers and bless Rahul
 aanan fanan main aisa kiya bhi gaya
 It was about to see in itself that in the rally where most minorities were seen, before Rahul's speech on the stage, the pooja-archana was clearly telling the attitude of Congress and Rahul's politics
 jambusar main raily ke baad rahul kaa kafila adivasee bahul ilaake ke liye ravaanaa hua
 Despite the crowds at the road intersections in minority areas at many places, Rahul just goes ahead with greetings
 amuman rahul is tarah kii jagah dekh kar jahaan zyada log ikattha hon to apni bas se mike nikaal kar kuch naa kuch kehete jarur hai
 But on Wednesday, he did nothing like this in a minority-dominated area
 bheed ke baavjood rahul ke haav-bhav se yahi laga ki ve is ilaake main mahaj apni upasthiti darj karakar teji se aage badhanaa chaahate hai
 The Congress undoubtedly distance itself from religion or caste politics
 lekin is baar gujarat main wo soft hindutv ke card ko majbootee se seene se chipka kar aage badhane ke mood main he
 The way Rahul is not forgetting to visit temples or Navdurga pandals during Gujarat visits, he is not doing it for the shrines of minorities
 congress kii isi ranneeti ke tahat party ke kaddavar netaa or sonia ke rajnatik sachiv ahamed patel ne gujarat chunaav main khud ko puri tarah baikfoot par rakhaa hua he
 Ahmed Patel, who hails from Gujarat, stayed away from Rahul's first two visits
 rahul kii teesri yatra jab ahamed patel ke grih janapad bharuch se shuru hui, to ve najar aae
 But Ahmad Patel's best effort was not to focus on him
 isiilie ikkaa dukka jagah par hi unhone rahul ke manch se chota bhaashan diya, wo bhi gujarati main
 Even though he sat on the stage in most places, he himself kept away from giving speeches
 ek jagah to rahul ne unase guzarish kii tab jaakar unhone mahaj 5 minute kaa bhaashan gujarati main hi diya
 In this tour of Gujarat, Rahul will visit Unayi Mata on the next day of campaigning in minority dominated area
 congressfoonk phoonk kar kadam aage badha rahi he
 The Congress is doing its best to ensure that the BJP does not get an opportunity from anywhere to try to sway its soft Hindutva card
 yahi vajah he ki rahul mandiron ke darshan or parikrama main puraa jor laga rahe hai
 Overall, the stakes of the Congress are clear that if they are able to compete with the majority of the BJP in Gujarat in the election campaign, then the minority voters will support it
 congress kii is ranneeti se yahi lagata he ki wo kahin naa kahin maanati he ki gujarat ke pichley chunaavon main muslim tushtikaran ke ilzaam ke chalate dhruvikaran kaa shikaar hokar wo harati rahi he
 This is the reason why Congress's hand is seen with soft Hindutva in Gujarat

 He raised doubts about the seriousness

 Although many people were worried about Aamir's safety, he is confident that nothing like this is going to happen there
 unka maananaa he ki bihar main kanoon-vyavastha or prashasan behtareen dhang se kaam kar rahaa he
 Aamir wanted to give the local administration enough time to prepare so that no security-related problems arise, so he moved his program a little further

 Attacking Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah said on Tuesday that some opposition leaders are giving speeches abroad as no one in the country wants to listen to them
 yahaan ek baithak main shah ne kaha, "kuch netaa videsh jaakar bhaashan dete hai
 They are afraid to speak in front of the people of their country

 in spoke to senior photo journalist Ravi Chaudhary who captured this picture in his camera
 ravi, samachar agency pitiai se jude hue hai
 Hear the whole story from Ravi Chaudhary next: - We knew that farmers can enter Delhi today and the police can stop them near delhi-up border
 so main subah saat baje hi yahaan pahunch gaya tha
 After waiting a long time, a small group of farmers arrived around 9 o'clock
 lagbhag 11 baje ke aasapaas kareeb 5 hajaar kisaan aa gaye
 Some farmers stayed behind, a short distance away
 kisaanon ke raste main upi police kii bhi ek bairicading thi
 The farmers removed that barricade and the UP Police personnel also gave way to them
 ab kisaanon kaa jattha apane tractor-trollies ke saath duusari bairicade ke paas pahunchaa
 This barricade was set up by Delhi Police
 ek taraf josh se bhare kisaanon kaa jattha or bairicade ke duusari taraf dilli police ke jawan or water canan kii gaadiyaan khadi thim
 i was standing on the flyover along this road with some of my photographer colleagues
 kisaanon ke haath main jhande the
 The police personnel were also equipped with guns that released poles and tear gas shells
 narebaazi karte hue kisaan aage jane kii koshish kar rahe the
 He was also trying to move the barricade with his tractor
 11:30 baje ke aasapaas police ne kisaanon par water canan kaa istemaal shuru kiya
 For about ten minutes, the police used it on the farmers
 iske turant baad unhone aansu gas ke gole daagne shuru kiye
 i have covered many more demonstrations and according to that, the police rained water on the farmers for a long time and fired tear gas shells
 kisaan is ection se teetar-bitar ho gaye
 The cloth disappeared from their flags and only the poles were left in their hands
 kisaanon ne police kii taraf kuch-kuch phenkna shuru kiya
 He was very angry
 tabhi mujhe dikhaa ki sadak ke kinare kuch ho rahaa he
 i zoomed my camera and showed that in response to the police poles, an elderly farmer has also raised his stick
 mujhe yah drishy kaafii maarmik laga
