 loksabhaa main tripal talaak ke khilaaf kanoon banane ke liye laae gaye bill par bahes ke dauraan 'ajtak' ke us sting oparation kaa bhi zikr hua jisamen mullah-maulavee talaak e biddat yani teen talaak bain ho jane ke baad uski kaat ke raste talash rahe hai
 Congress MP Sushmita Dev took up the matter, and sought a response from the government, but bjp's MP Meenakshi Lekhi made it clear in her reply that this bill is not only being used as a divorce-a-biddat but as a cut
 Divorce-a-bin would also be considered a crime
 gauratlab he ki supreme court ne teen talaak ko asanvaidhanik qaraar diya he
 After this, the Modi government introduced a bill in the Lok Sabha today, making it a crime and a provision for punishment on its use
 bill par bahes ke dauraan congress kii saansad sushmita dev ne sawaal uthaaya ki sarkaar talaak-e-biddat yani teen talaak ko to jurm ghoshit kar degi lekin uski kaat ke liye talaak-e-bin kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 Sushmita cited the sting operation of 'aaj Tak' in support of her point
 gauratlab he ki buudhvaar shaam dikhaae gaye ajtak ke sting oparation main kai aise maulavee benakaab hue the jo talaak-e-biddat bain hone ke baad talaak-e-bin ke jariye pati-patni ko alag karvaa rahe the
 There is no need to speak three divorces in a divorce-a-bin
 isamen do baar talaak bolne se talaak ho jaataa he
 If the wife has to be brought back to life after the set-up, she has to perform the ritual of Halala, while according to the Maulanas, there is no need for any halala if the wife is to be brought back to life after the divorce-a-bin
 reporter ke ye poochne par ki usamen koi supreme court se dikkat to nahin hogi? mufti sadik ne jawaab diya ki koi dikkat nahin he
 This is permission
 aaj jab sushmita dev ne ye maamla sadan main uthaaya to bijepi kii ore se minakshi lekhi ne jawaab diya
 Meenakshi said that the bill introduced is not just divorce-e-biddat but all such divorces through which the wife is separated in one stroke
 yani isamen talaak-e-biddat ke saath-saath talaak-e-bin bhi shaamil he
 It will not happen that in case of triple talaq ban, a husband calls his wife once or twice and let her out of the house and escapes the clutches of the law

 bharat-pakistan vibhaajan ke baad ab tak pehali baar aisa hua he ki pakistan sarkaar ne hindu puja sthalon kii dekhbhaal karne ke liye hindu pujaariyon ko protsaahit karne kaa nirnay liya he
 In a special interaction with the Hindu priests 'salary package' Aaj Tak 'and' India Today ', Yadavai Trust Property Board (ETPB) chairman Muhammad Siddikul Farooq said,' All the temples and gurdwaras under this board in Pakistan are there
 It has been decided to increase the salary of his priests and Mahants of Gurdwaras
 khaskar hamane hindu pujaariyon kii tankhwaah main kam se kam das hajaar pakistani rupye kaa ijapha kiya he
 This would be the most desired increase in the salary package of Hindu priests
 isko lekar 9 sitambar ko lahore main ek baithak yojit kar rahe hai, jisamen hindu pujaariyon ke vetan ko badhaava dene kaa agenda hoga
 The question also raised about the security, according to the Pakistan Hindu Council, the situation of the priests of about four hundred Hindu temples in Pakistan, who do not come under the Avakai Trust Property Board, is very pathetic
 unhen apana or mandir kaa guzaara bhakt ke chadhaave se chalaanaa padataa he, saath hi aae din un par hamale hote hai
 The priests live in awe, 'aaj Tak' and 'india Today' tried to contact the priests of temples in Pakistan on the question of increasing the salary by ETPB, many priests refused to speak on it
 unka kahana tha ki ve log bahut dare hue he or khauf main rahete hai or is maamle par kuch bolnaa unke liye thik nahin he
 Hardly, the priest of the 15 hundred year old Panchmukhi Hanuman temple in Karachi, Sri Ramnath Mishra Maharaj agreed to talk
 unhone evakai trust property board ko vetan badhane ke liye dhanyavad diya or saath hi trust ke baahar ke mandiron ke pujaariyon or mandiron par gaur karne kii naseehat di

 Now think about the situation of GST
 bharat kii duusari aazaadee (jaisaa ki sansad main ardharatri isaki shuruyaat ke vakt kaha gaya tha) 18 maah main aisi pranali main badal gai he jiske aarthik makasad dhwast ho chuke hai
 GST is a staggering reform before the election, whereby the remaining drops of political gains are being squeezed
 jiesti kaa rajasav sangrah lakshya se milon dur he or khajaanon kaa haal khasta he
 If the government had started with a GST with two tax rates from the beginning, then the matter was different, but now the complexity has been created
 sarkaar ko thos taur par yah bhi pataa nahin ki gujarat chunaav se lekar aaj tak jiesti main riyaayaton ke baad utpaadon yaa sevaaon kii keemten kam hui bhi hai kyonki companiyaan laagat badaae ke kaaran mulya badha rahi hai
 The mechanism to stop profiteering under GST is yet to be introduced, so that who has benefited from the concessions
 riyaayaton ke asar se khapat yaa maang badaae yaa companiyon kaa kaarobaar badaae ke pramaan bhi nahin hai
 Then suddenly the reason for this tax kindness • In the last 18 months, the government has realized that in terms of revenue, monthly one lakh crore rupees
 ke sangrah kaa lakshya philhal mushkil he
 Tax collections from services have declined
 jiesti ab keval bade nirmaataa or seva pradaata (jo pichhali pranali main bhi pramukh karadaata the) ke kar yogadan par chal rahaa he
 Small taxpayers and newly registered businesses have returned to the old pattern of tax evasion with the help of concessions
 • jiesti main abhi ausatan 60 fisadi kaarobaari ritern bhar rahe hai
 Expectations of transparency have also come after the implementation of the e-bill
 chunaav ke maddesner tex chori par sakhti mushkil he
 • GST systems and regulations are not yet stable
 rafu-paband jari hai
 Therefore, before the elections, the government did two things - a return form deferred the annual return (9) till next year
 iske bina karadaataaon ke hisaab sucharu (invais maiching) karnaa or tex credit sambhav nahin he
 This is the reason why GST did not show any positive impact on the economy
 do—jiesti to chal nahin rahaa to isse kam se kam chunavi phayda hi ho jaae
 This was the last opportunity for the central government to use the GST in political terms
 pichley 18 maheene main desh kaa rajnatik bhugol badal gaya he
 Now the number of opposition states has increased in the GST Council, so further consensus is going to be difficult
 council kii haalia baithak main iske sanket bhi mili
 Opposition-ruled states have started talking about changing GST completely
 kabhi kisi mantri ne kaha tha ki desh main hawaii chappal yaa car par ek jaisaa kar nahin ho saktaa (ab 99 fisadi
 
 
 ) Or GST will eliminate tax evasion from the country or it will reduce the cost of business or it will increase GDP
 aaj sarkaar in par sawaal bhi sunanaa nahin chaahati
 Is GST moving towards a future like states' VAT? After its success in its early years (2005–08), the states overcame VAT discipline due to politics and financial constraints
 haalanki jiesti waite se kahin zyada sugathit he lekin jab centre sarkaar hi chunavi raajnneeti ke khatir iske anushaasan kaa murabba bana chuki to rajya bhi anushaasan todenge
 State level concessions in the e-bill are a sample of this
 isi farvari main hamane likhaa tha ki jiesti kaa sudhaarwad ab itihaas kii baat he
 In just seven months, India's latest reform has become like the old radio, which is being run on
 atharah maah baad is radio main ab keval chunavi prasaaran chal rahe hai
 It is difficult to say what will happen to the GST next year, but by 2019 it has been proved that our understanding and courage of political reforms are impoverished

 According to this material, the naming of this mountain was carried out by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN)

 loksabhaa chunaav ke chauthe charan main uttar pradesh kii 13 sansadeey siton par 29 april ko vot daale jaaenge
 Of these, 5 Lok Sabha seats are reserved for Scheduled Castes and all five of these seats are occupied by BJP
 haalanki is baar ke sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke chalate badale raajnneetik sameekaran ko dekhte hue bijepi ne paanch main chaar saansadon ke tikat katkar nae chehron ko maidan main utaara he
 Despite this, it is not easy for BJP to repeat the victory in these seats
 hardoi:hardoi loksabhaa seat anusuchit jati ke liye surakshit he
 In this seat, there is a close contest between Jai Prakash Rawat of BJP, Usha Verma of SP and Virendra Verma of Congress
 haalanki 2014 main bijepi ke anshul verma ne basapa ke shiv prasad verma ko kareeb 81 hajaar maton se haraaya tha
 But after cutting the ticket of Anshul Verma, BJP has placed a bet on Jai Prakash Rawat, a former MP close to Naresh Agarwal and who lost the election as SP candidate from Mishrikh seat in the last Lok Sabha election
 isse naaraaz hokar anshul verma ne bijepi chhodkar sapa kaa daaman tham liya he
 Actually, in the politics of Hardoi, Naresh Agarwal's opinion speaks
 yahi vajah he bijepi ne unke chahete par bharosa jataayaa he, lekin sapa-basapa ke gathbandhan ke chalate ushaa verma or jai prakaash ravat ke bich is seat par kaante kaa muqabla mana ja rahaa he
 Mishrikh: The Mishrikh Lok Sabha seat is also reserved for Scheduled Castes
 is seat par bijepi ne ashok ravat, basapa ne nilu satyaarthee or congress ne manjar raahi ko chunavi maidan main utaara he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, bjp's Anju Bala won the BSP by defeating Ashok Rawat by about 87 thousand votes
 hardoi kii tarah mishrikh seat par bhi naresh agarwal kii chali
 Here too, BJP has reposed trust in Ashok Rawat from BSP by cutting the ticket of his sitting MP
 aise main ab naresh agarwal par hardoi or mishrikh donon surakshit siton par apane karibiyon ko jitaane kii jimmedaari he, lekin gathbandhan ke chalate badale siyaasi sameekaran main bijepi ke liye ye siten bachaae rakhana badi chunauti he
 Shahjahanpur: Shahjahanpur Lok Sabha seat is also reserved for Scheduled Castes
 is seat par bijepi ne arun kumaar sagar, basapa ne amar chandra johar or congress ne brahmaswaroop sagar ko apana pratyaashee banaaya he
 In 2014, Krishnaraj of BJP defeated Umaid Singh Kashyap of BSP by 2 lakh 35 thousand votes
 bijepi ne hardoi mishrikh kii tarah shahjahanpur seat par apane maujuuda saansad kaa tikat arun sagar par daanv lagaaya he, lekin congress ne jis tarah se brahmaswaroop ko maidan main utarkar bijepi ke sameekaran ko bigaad diya he
 However, in 2014, the SP-BSP got as many votes as it could get
 usase zyada akele bijepi ko mila tha
 In such a situation, winning this seat is a big challenge for both the alliance and the BJP
 itawa:itawa loksabhaa seat anusuchit jati ke arakshit he
 From here, BJP has fielded Ram Shankar Katheria, SP from Kamlesh Katheria and Congress has nominated Ashok Kumar Doher
 2014 main bijepi ke ashok dohare ne sapa ke premadas katheria ko kareeb paune do lakh maton se maat dekar jeet hasil kii thi
 But the BJP has relied on Ram Shankar Katheria, MP from Agra, by cutting the ticket of double
 isse ashok dohare naaraaz hokar congress kaa daaman thamkar maidan main utar gaye hai
 The interesting thing is that whenever the BJP won from Etawah, its government was formed at the center

 ham apni mehnat or dimag se kaabil to ban jate hai lekin kabhi-kabhi kuch maukon par hamaari kaabiliyat bhi hamaare kaam nahin aa paati
 These are the occasions when our emphasis is not on certain events
 isi ko ham apni jabaan main bura daur kehete hai or insaan kii fitrat hi aisi he ki bure daur main hi use ishwar kii yaad aati he
 Then he goes to their shelter and begs them for their wishes
 lekin ek baat aapane zarur maanenge ki ishwar sabhi kii prarthana bhi nahin sunata
 If you want your call to reach God, then you should know the right way to pray
 prarthana kaa arthishwar se apane dil kii baat kahana hi prarthana he
 This makes a person try to wish for himself or others
 vaise, tantra, mantra, dhyaan or jaap bhi prarthana kaa hi ek rup he
 Prayer works on a small scale and due to this the nature changes according to you
 koi prarthana ek saath kai log karen to vah zyada prabhaavshaalee hoti he
 Praying together changes the nature rapidly
 prarthana ansuni kyon ho jaati heinsaan ko kabhi-kabhi lagata he ki vah ishwar se prarthana to khub kar rahaa he lekin ye suni nahin ja rahi hai
 If you are in this situation then we tell you why prayers sometimes fail
 pehle aap yah samaj lijie kivyavsaay or len-denki tarah kii prarthana bhi asafal hoti he
 There are some reasons for the failure of prayer, such as: - Prayer fails due to lack of control over diet and behavior - Prayer fails due to not respecting parents - Prayer fails even if you are harming yourself It becomes- Irrational prayer also fails
 Prayer done in the right manner of prayer brings miraculous changes in life
 - prarthana saral or saaf tareeke se kii jaani chahie or aasaani se boli jane vaali prarthana kerani chahie
 - It is best to pray in a calm environment
 - khaastaur par madhya raatri main prarthana jaldi sweekaar ho jaati he
 - It is good to pray at the same time every day
 - vahiin duusare ke nuksaan ke uddeshy se yaa phir ataarkik prarthana mat karen
 - Think about it before praying for another and then start praying
 agar aapane ye niyam apanaae to yakeen maniye ki aapaki prarthanachahe dhan kii ho yaa santan yaa phir naukari kii,yah puri jarur hogi
 Method of Prayer Accept your prayers your prayers, for this you should pray with some rules
 jaane in niyamon ke bare main :- sabase pehle ek ekant sthaan main baithen- uske baad apni ridh kii haddi ko bilkul sidhaa rakhen- phir sabase pehle apane isht, guru yaishwar kaa dhyaan karen- uske baad jo prarthana kerani he, use karen- apni prarthana ko gopneey hi rakhen- jab bhi mauka mili, apni prarthana doharaate rahevgar aapane in tareekon se sachche man se prarthana kii to yakeenan aapaki manokamana puri hogi
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has praised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, saying that the clear and tough attitude he has shown towards the protesters against the Kudankulam nuclear plant is welcome
 sangh ne aarope lagaaya he ki is pradarshan ko hawa dene main carch ke varisht log hi nahin balki cardinal or bishap str ke log bhi shaamil hai
 An editorial in the issue of the RSS mouthpiece Organizer said that we welcome the clear and strong stand taken by the Prime Minister against the unusually Kudankulam protesters
 isamen aarope lagaaya gaya he ki kudankulam or uske aasapaas ke kshetra main vyaapt garibi kaa phayda uthaa kar carch vahaan bade paimaane par fal-phool rahe hai
 They are now afraid that the setting up of a nuclear plant there will improve the socio-economic condition of the people of the region and the churches will not be able to lure people by taking advantage of poverty
 sampadakeey main kaha gaya he ki kendra ne is bare main jo kadam uthaaya, vah der se uthaaya he lekin der aae durust aae

 It said that when the central government started to clamp down on such ngos, those organizations made a mockery of the government and started accusing them of 'undemocratic, vendetta and repression'
 sangh ne kaha he ki is parmaanu sanyantr kaa nirmaan kaary varshon se jari tha or sthaneey janata ne uskaa kabhi virodh nahin kiya lekin jaise hi iske sanchaalan kaa samay paas aayaa, in carch ke logon ne vahaan kii janata ko barglaana shuru kar diya
 Complaining that there is no system of effective monitoring of the functioning of ngos in India, the Sangh has said that there is a dire need to do so
 isamen kaha gaya he ki saamaajik kaary ke naam par enjio ko videshon se bade paimaane par dhan mil rahaa he
 The editorial, quoting the Ministry of Home Affairs, said that in 2010-11 there were 233 ngos, each of which received foreign aid of more than one hundred crore rupees
 usne daawa kiya he ki isamen se adhiktar enjio chachare se jude hai jo saamaajik kaary se kahin adhik dharmantaran main sanlagn hai

 In order to ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi the account of 22 years of BJP in Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi tweeted another on Thursday
 rahul ne is twit main gujarat par karj ko lekar narendra modi se sawaal poocha he
 The Congress Vice President has said that Gujarat had a debt of Rs 9,183 crore in 1995 and in 2017, Gujarat has a debt of Rs 2,41,000 crore
 yani har gujarati par 37 hajaar rupee kaa karj he
 Keeping these figures in front, Rahul Gandhi has asked why the people of Gujarat should pay the punishment for Narendra Modi's financial mismanagement and publicity? Rahul's mistake in Somnath is a setback for Congress's soft Hindutva strategy? Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi in 22 years in Gujarat In order to seek account from BJP on taking control of power, has started asking one question every day

 The controversy arose from the signing of Rahul Gandhi's media coordinator Manoj Tyagi in a register for non-hindus
 iske bare main congress ne kaha he ki is register main baad main rahul gandhi or ahamed patel kaa naam joda gaya
 Shortly after this tour, the register with the signature of Manoj Tyagi started circulating on social media, in which the names of Rahul Gandhi and Ahmed Patel were on the left

 rahul gandhi ne oktober se 20 se zyada hindu devi-devataaon ke mandiron kaa daura kiya he
 Congress is lying
 daakhil kii gai pravishti dikhaati he ki vah hindu nahin hai
 Manoj Tyagi later issued a statement saying that he had recorded Gandhi's name to take media personnel inside the temple
 yah rahul gandhi yaa ahamed patel kii taraf se nahin tha
 It would have been added later

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) We are different genders and live two types of lives: Savita Singhira Tak: Women are taught to dream by keeping them in the circle, don't run after the dream, you sit in the chair, say: Come on the stage of 'sahitya Aaj Tak 2019' On the third day, the three women writers involved in the seminar organized on the theme of 'girls' dreams', admitted that there was not much chance for girls to see their dreams
 The LTE
 ladakiyon ko pehle se taiyaar kiye khwab hi dekhne kii ijaajat hoti he
 Changes need to be made to see the dream
 yah bhi sahi he ki ladkiyaan ladakon se alag hoti hai or unke khwab bhi alag dekhne kii anumati milani chahie
 On the question of whether girls' dreams are different from boys, the poet and director of SGDS IGNOU, Professor Savita Singh said that it is only necessary to believe that we are separate genders and live two types of lives
 ek samaaj main rahete hue bhi hamaara jivan alag-alag he
 While living separately, our life is also together
 ladakiyon ke khwab ladakon se algah savita singhprofessor savita singh ne aage kaha ki ham kitna jivan saath chaahate hai or kitna alag jivan jeena chaahate hai yah asal mudda hota he
 There are many people who believe that women do not have separate lives
 unamem itnaa fark nahin hota ki unke liye jivan main kuch alag ho
 There are also many women who see dreams and their dreams may be close to those of men and may differ from them
 professor savita singhise bhi padhein xxrep 4 - 'good-bed tach kya, sikhaane vaali aisi kahaniyon kii bacchon ko jarurat'unhone kaha ki ham log bhartiya he
 We belong to a particular religion, caste, sexuality
 ladakiyon ke khwab alag hote hai
 Talking about the dreams of girls, the dream of middle class girls is to become a professor, become a doctor, become a pilot etc
 unke khwab madhyavargeey khwab hi jaise hote hai or yah khwab kabhi purushon ke khwab the
 Can not say anything about what the dream will take in women
 professor ira takaladkiyaan khud ko insaan samajheh ira taakira taak kaa is sawaal par kahana he ki ladakiyon kaa khwab dekhnaa is myne main alag he kyonki unhen pehle se taiyaar kiye hue khwab milte hai
 This is the situation not only for middle class but also for upper class girls
 mahilaon ko khwab die jate hai
 We are taught to see a dream by placing it in a circle
 ladkiyaan khud ko insaan samajhnaa chahie
 He is also a human being and he also has the right to dream
 jivan main kabhi bhi is baat kaa malaal na ho ki ham kuch nahin kar sake
 Professor Akanksha Pare Kashiv, author, Akanksha Pare Kashiv said on the dream of girls that there were conditions for girls' dreams which were not visible to others
 khud ladakiyon ko bhi nahin dikhte
 Condition application means that girls have to go somewhere
 yahi badi cheez he jo dikhti to nahin he, lekin iskaa asar bada hota he
 Boys' dreams differ from girls because boys and girls are asked to do different things
 har safal stri ke peeche striah ira tokalekhika or filmkaar ira taak ne kaha ki har safal stri ke peeche stri kaa haath hota he
 In today's era, women have contributed to the success of women
 haalanki stri hi stri kii dushman hoti he' kii kahawat pitaatmak tathy he lekin yah sahi bhi he
 When a girl is successful, girls are the first to judge
 unhone kaha ki ham yah sochane lagate hai ki hamaare saath bura hua or aage badhane nahin diya gaya
 They feel that the dreams that they were not allowed to see should also happen to others
 jabaki is sambandh main yah kuch is tarah se bhi ho saktaa he jo cheez aapke saath nahin ho sakaa to wo kisi or ke liye na ho aisa bhi kiya janaa chahie
 Such changes should be made
 ek aurat ke bare main aurat acchhee baat kahati he to vahi banjh kyon kahati he aakanksha ne kaha ki yah aurat kaa sapana hota he or log apeksha bhi karte hai
 He said that father and brother look at us from childhood, they help us to move forward, but there are many people who help in advancing
 aakanksha ne kaha ki sapane ke peeche mat bhaagie, aap kursi par baithiye or unase kahie ki aao

 Arun Shourie, who was a cabinet minister in the BJP government, has once again attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government
 shouri ne piem ko ahamkaari qaraar diya or unpar ek vyakti ke prabhutv vaali 'raashtrapati pranali kii sarkaar' chalaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 He said that a man-centered government is not a good sign for the country
 unhone kaha ki modi koi bhi faisla apane kuch khaas logon ke saath lete hai jo unheen ke chune hue hai
 'government occupies one man', while raising his voice against Prime Minister Narendra Modi once again, said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi throws people away using paper napkins
 ve keval khud se pyaar karte hai
 In a special conversation with India Today, Shourie said that two years of government are nearing completion and looking at the situation, it can be said that the reins of government are concentrated in the hands of a man
 aisa prathit hota he ki ek aadmi ne puri sarkaar par kabja kar liya he
 According to Shourie, the last two years were like a boxing match with someone every day
 unhone kaha ki is sarkaar ne behtareen do saal gavaan die
 Questioning the government's decision, questioning the government's decision, Shourie said that imposition of President's rule in Congress-ruled Arunachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand was an unconstitutional decision
 is faisle kii bijepi kii nitiyon ko jhatka laga he
 He said that India's relations with Pakistan are currently inconceivable
 narendra modi ke pakistan ke saath videsh niti na to sanvaidhanik he or naa hi taarkik hai
 He said that Pakistan's PM has misled India so far by his trickery
 unhone kaha ki pakistan ne haalia dinon bharat ko keval murkh banane kaa kaam kiya
 Shourie said that he does not like this government with good governance at any point of view
 desh ke naagarik se lekar sena ke jawan tak santusht nahin hai
 Then what good governance is being talked about? The government surrounded the Lalit Modi case, but Kishori admitted during the interview that till now the image of the government is impeccable
 lekin unhone kaha ki bijepi shasit rajyon main bhrashtachar ke maamle saamne aae
 He mentioned the Vyapam scam in Madhya Pradesh and the PDS scam in Chhattisgarh
 iske alaava shouri ne lalit modi maamle par centre sarkaar ko galat tareeke se handle karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Shourie said that the Modi government's steps in all these matters were not in the right direction
 shouri ne china ke saath bhi bharat ke rishte par sawaal uthaaya
 He said that the government's foreign policy with China is in the wrong direction
 agasta westland maamle par daage savangasta westlandmamle par modi sarkaar ke rukh par shouri ne hamalaa kiya
 He said why the government is not appealing in Italy's lower court against the acquittal of Gisupe Oresi and Bruno Spagnolini of the two former heads of the company? According to Shourie, there is nothing new in the way Manohar Parrikar is cheering the case
 parrikar ke sansad main die bhaashan ko shouri se galat bataaya
 Last year too, Arun Shourie had questioned the policies of the government on the completion of one year of the Modi government

 dilli se sate gajiabad main ek baar phir khulaa naala ek 15 saal ke ladke kii maut kii vajah ban gaya
 This boy was a student of tenth grade
 gajiabad ke thana vijay nagar ilaake kii sarvoday nagar colony main shanivaar ko achaanak us vakt afra-tafari kaa maahaul ho gaya, jab dopaher baad achaanak hi ai tej barish ke baad naale overflo ho gaye sadak bhi barish ke pani se labalab ho gai
 During this time, a student studying in class x went into the drain
 haalanki maukey par khadey logon ne chaatr ko bachaane kaa bharsak prayaas kiya
 But due to the strong current, the juvenile got washed away
 aanan-fanan main isaki soochna sthaneey police ko di gai
 On the basis of information, local police and top officials also reached the spot
 saath hi damakal vibhaag kii team or andiaref kii team ko maukey par bulaayaa gaya
 After about 4 hours of hard work, the teenager was taken out of the drain and rushed to the hospital with immediate effect
 lekin aspataal main doctoron ne use mrit ghoshit kar diya
 However, open drains in Ghaziabad are proving to be a drain of death continuously

 Both used to go to school on their bicycles
 barish ke turant baad hi skool kii chuttee hui to shubham apni cycle se apane bhai dipanshu se kuch der pehle hi nikal gaya
 He reaches home but not Deepanshu
 dopaher baad achaanak hi tej barish hui, jiske kaaran sabhi barsaati naale bhar gaye or sadak par bhi pani labalab ho gaya
 Water was visible everywhere
 isi dauraan 15 saal kaa dipanshu apni cycle se ghar ja rahaa tha lekin cycle naale kii taraf chali gai or vah tej pani main bah gaya
 During this time, a girl standing nearby saw him falling and made a noise
 aasapaas ke log maukey par ikattha hue
 Though an attempt was made to save him, the flow of water was so fast that it swept Deepanshu
 haalanki kuch duuri par hi uski cycle mil gai
 In a hurry, it was reported to the local police
 soochna ke aadhaar par maukey par police pahunch gai or sthaneey logon kii madad se dipanshu ko khojna shuru kiya gaya
 But after not getting any success, the fire department team and NDRF team were called to the spot
 4 ghante kii kadi mashkkat ke baad dipanshu kareeb 400 meter kii duuri par naale ke andar kooday main atka hua mila, jise aanan-fanan main aspataal pahunchaaya gaya
 But doctors declared him dead
 jaise hi dipanshu ke parijanon ne yah khabar suni to unke pairon tale jameen khisak gai
 On the other hand, the people of the area are also very angry against the Municipal Corporation
 unhone jamkar nagar nigam ko kosa, lekin maukey par maujuud pulicekarmiyon ne kisi tarah logon ko us vakt shant kiya
 People allege that many drains are open in this area, who always feast on the death of people
 logon kaa kahana he ki is bare main kai baar nagar nigam ke adhikariyon ko bhi avgat karaayaa ja chukaa he
 Despite that, no attention was paid to this
 iske kaaran dipanshu kaal ke gaal main samaa gaya
 Open drains are continuously killing innocent people
 dipanshu kii maut khule naale kii vajah se hui jisaki vajah se ghatana kii saaf jimmedaari gajiabad nagar nigam or gajiabad prashasan kii he
 However, administration officials today were seen avoiding responsibility by saying that the drain should be opened for cleaning
 lekin sawaal vahi he ki agar naale ko safai kii vajah se kholaa gaya tha or barish kii vajah se kaam roak diya gaya to naale ko dubaara dhakaa kyon nahin gaya
 Also, why no such alternative arrangement was made that no accident happens here
 haalanki puure maamle main haadase kii jaanch kii baat nagar nigam or sthaneey prashasan ke adhikari kah rahe hai
 At the same time, the family of the child became upset after seeing the body of their innocent child

 Mayawati termed Rahul's statement on yesterday's bombings in Mumbai as irresponsible and frustrating the public

 He said that such comments in times of crisis cause public morale to fall

 But according to the information received from the top sources of the government, the officials suspect that once the information about the Modi government's decision spreads in Jammu and Kashmir, then there can be disturbances in the valley
 bataa den ki is vakt ghati main sanchaar ke sabhi saadhan thap hai
 Therefore, information about the government's decision has not been reached in many areas of the plaintiff

 At the same time, Pakistan will also try to provoke feelings in the plaintiff

 However, the Army has announced a policy of zero tolerance to deal with such elements
 iske saath hi is baat kaa dhyaan rakhaa jayega ki aam nagarikon ko kisi tarah kii koi dikkat nahin pahunche
 The second challenge is the challenge before the government on Jammu and Kashmir to transfer rights and obligations from the old structure to the new administrative system
 iske liye ajit dobhaal yuddh str par kaam kar rahe hai or koshish kii ja rahi he ki power kaa sahaj sthanantaran ho jaae
 The government believes that if the new system starts working without any trouble then the reaction of the people can be smooth

 Expressing displeasure over the failure of the police to trace the real documents related to the 2001 hit-and-run case involving the alleged involvement of actor Salman Khan, a sessions court gave him the last opportunity to locate the documents by 12 September
 police ne adaalat ko pehali baar bataaya ki is maamle kii cese diariyaan tak gaayab hai
 Earlier he had stated that only seven of the 63 original statements of witnesses can be traced, although correct copies are available
 salmaan ke vakil shrikant shivade ne tark diya ki kanoon ke mutabik, mul dastavejon ko sunwaayee se pehle adaalat ke samaksh pesh kiya janaa jaruri he, jabaki police ne tark diya tha ki mumbai kii adaalaton kii kaarywahi ke anusaar, mukademon kii sunwaayee sahi pratilipiyon ke saath chal sakati he
 Judge DW Deshpande directed the police to inform them about the status of their action on the next occasion and said that after this the court will examine what documents they have and what documents are with the accused
 iske aadhaar par adaalat yah jaanchegi ki is maamle kii sunwaayee ko aage badhanaa upyukt hoga

 Obviously, if this happens, Nikita will be the happiest
 or agar nikita par chhidi bahes kisi anjaam tak pahunchati he to isse or nikitaon kaa bhi ho saktaa he bhala

 At the same time, socialism became clear from Russia in 1990
 viksit deshon se china ne sadhi dostiiske baad globaligeshan kaa daura aa gaya
 Developed countries brought in a period of new globalization, which is part of the Washington Consensus
 vishwa ke poonjivadiyon ne apana ek niyam banaaya or globaligeshan par thope diya, jise nayaa udaarvaad kehete hai
 In this, China began to establish its own setting, globalization itself was an instrument of imperialism
 haalanki china ne samajhadaari dikhaai ki usne globaligeshan ke paitare main apane sharton ko pramukhataa se rakhaa
 China benefited the most from this
 china ne dhire-dhire sabhi deshon ke bazaar par kabja kar liya
 Now, US President Donald Trump is imposing a new type of import tax to tighten China
 kholani padi 25 fisadi arthvyavasthaprofessor esen malakar ne bataaya ki globaligeshan kii vajah se china ko bhi apana bazaar kholana padaa he
 However, it has opened only 25% of the industrialist zone
 krishi kshetra main abhi bhi uskaa bazaar band hi mana jaataa he
 With 25 per cent open economy, China is earning from capitalist countries and for this reason a new class is also being born, which is a big reason for distance from socialism
 samaajwaad main varg viheen samaaj hota he
 However, China has shown an understanding that it has not opened 75 per cent of its market yet, giving socialism time to stay
 china main puunjipati nahin lete hanfaislaprofessor esen malakar bataate hai ki china main koi bhi faisla vahaan kii sarkaar leti he, vahaan puunjipati nirnay nahin lete hai, jo rashtriya sampatti duniyabar se kamai jaati he, use vahaan kii janata par kharch kiya jaataa he
 In such a situation, we can say that there is socialism, but i do not think that socialism will remain in China for a long time
 isaki sabase badi vajah vargeey sanrachana kaa shuru hona he
 Private companies are growing in China
 unhen china kii sarkaar protection muhaiyaa kara rahi he
 Gradually, these companies are also set to interfere in the agricultural sector
 isse varg sanrachana main badhotaree hogi or samaajwaad khatm hota jayega
 Why gave the theory of socialist market? Professor SN Malakar said that China is at such a point that it cannot be called a socialist country
 isiilie china ne khud hi ek siddhant diya, jise samaajawaadee bazaar kehete hai
 Vietnam also considers this principle
 is bazaar kaa swaroop ye he ki samaajawaadee vyavastha ke sheersh par jo log hai unke niyantran main har tarah kaa deveopment rahegaa
 Whenever there is an upheaval (like in Hong Kong and Tianmen Square), the Chinese government will crush and control it through the People's Liberation Army, but the Chinese government also makes little concessions so that the economy is not affected
 professor malakar ne kaha ki china samaajwaad or poonjeevaad donon ko pakade hue he, jabaki samaajwaad apni sanrachana main hi poonjeevaad kaa ghor virdohi he
 Well, the world is under pressure from the capitalists, in such a situation, socialism is not possible to last long in China
 internet par gyaan nahin dete chini vampanthiprofessor esen malakar ne bataaya ki chini sena ke andar abhi poonjivadi vichaardhaara nahin ghus pai he kyonki china kii sena main communist party ke member hai
 There, the member of the Communist Party does not provide knowledge on the Internet
 unki baqayda kareeb teen saal kii training hoti he
 They are told about the world
 saath hi sadsyta ke liye vatting main bhi rakhaa jaataa he
 When there is a strong ideology in the army of a country, it can be used at any time
 china kii puri army rashtrawaad or communist vichaardhaara se las he
 In such a situation, there is an upheaval in China (like happened in Hong Kong and Tianmen Square), then the army controls there
 haalanki iske jariye taanaashaahee bhi panpi he, jo samaajwaad kaa hissaa nahin he
 Professor Malakar said that it would be meaningless if we find socialism in the Soviet Union and Cuba today in China
 kal bharat aa rahe hai chini raashtrapatichin ke raashtrapati shi jinping shuukravaar ko do din kii bharat yatra par aa rahe hai
 This will be the first visit of the Chinese President to India after Narendra Modi became Prime Minister for the second time
 haalanki, do din ke is daure main bharat-china ke bich koi bada qaraar hone kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Because this is a kind of informal visit, in which no definite agenda will be discussed

 We should not be afraid of such reinforcement or integration
 mujhe pataa he ki yahaan gaurav or pahchaan kaa sawaal he, lekin aakhirkaar is desh kii banking pranali main thod-bahut vilay or ekikaran to hona he
