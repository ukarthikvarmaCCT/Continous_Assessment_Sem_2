 kya rajasthan kaa vidhansabha chunaav is baar bijepi hindutv ke mudde par ladegi? jis tarah se bijepi ne apni pehali suchi main kisi bhi muslim ummidavaar ko tikat nahin diya he use lekar kai sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 In fact, since the beginning in Rajasthan, the HBJP has been giving tickets to 6 to 4 Muslim candidates in the assembly elections, but this time the ticket of BJP MLA Habibur Rahman of Nagaur, who was a 5-time MLA, has been cut
 sattarudh bijepi ne ek din pehle chunaav ke liye ummidavaaron kii pehali list jari kar di
 In the first list of 131 candidates for the 200-member assembly, 12 women and 32 young faces were given an opportunity, despite the absence of Muslim names in it
 sarkaar ke number 2 kaa naam bhi gaayab!rajasthansarkaar main pichley 5 saal se number do kii haisiyat se 2-2 mantralay (peedblyoody or roadways) sanbhaalane vaale younus khan kaa naam pehali suchi se gaayab he
 Similarly, in Sikar and Jhunjhunu, BJP has fielded Muslim candidates, where this time it has not given ticket
 iske alaava khudavasundhara rajeke kshetra dhaulpur se bhi do baar sagir ahamed vidhayak rah chuke hai, lekin is baar unhen bhi tikat nahin diya gaya he
 In Jhalawar, the constituency of Vasundhara Raje, Muslims have been voting for Vasundhara Raje in large numbers and Assad Ali takes over the entire elections and the BJP office in Jhalawar also runs from Asad Ali's house
 vasundhara rajehameshaa se 36 ke 36 kaumon ko saath lekar chalane kii baat karti rahi he, lekin is baar kai siton par sangh ke dabaav main vasundhara raaje ko jhukna padaa he
 In the 40 rallies of Yogi Adityanath, it is believed that the BJP may be riding on the agenda of Hindutva to fill the decreasing popularity of BJP in Rajasthan
 bijepi kii taraf se muslim ummidavaaron kaa khadaa naa hona to charchaa kaa vishay bana hua he
 This time, 40 rallies have been held for Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in Rajasthan elections
 iske alaava chaar road sho bhi yogi adityanath karenge
 Yogi Adityanath's rally and assembly in Rajasthan in this way shows that the BJP can run its Brahmastra Hindutva in Rajasthan assembly elections
 iske pehle bhi bijepi mob linching or bundi jaitaaran jaise dangon main apane party varkar or emele ke saath khadi rahi he
 In Nagaur, two BJP mlas have been winning in rssnagaur
 paanch baar ke emele habiburrahman or vasundhara ke sabase kareebi mantri younus khan ko tikat nahin milane par aisa kaha ja rahaa he ki nagaur ko rashtriya swayamsevak sangh apane hindutv kii ek prayogshaala ke rup main dekh rahaa he
 Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat has migrated to Nagaur twice in the last 5 years
 iske alaava dilli main bhi aatanki ghatnaon main kai alpsankhyakon ke giraftaar nagaur se hui he
 10 Muslim boys were also imprisoned for a long time for raising slogans against Bharat Mata in Nagaur
 is maamle par jababijepike pravaktaa sudhanshu trivedi se poocha gaya ki kyon bijepi kisi bhi muslim ummidavaar ko pehali suchi main jagah nahin di he
 Sudhanshu Trivedi said that the Congress has so far duped Muslims by giving them tickets
 alpsankhyak samaaj main shiksha, bhukhmaree or garibi kii jitani samasyaayein hai vah sab congress kii dein he
 Not paying tickets does not matter

 com / f5pcxnui6v Due to the Uri attack, the country is seeking answers from the Modi government at the center, in this episode, Kapil Mishra, the cabinet minister of Delhi government, has written in his blog that the country is paying the price for the secret deal between Nawaz and Modi ji
 desh ko pataa hona chahie ki modi or navaj sharif ke bich baar-baar hone vaali gupt mulakaaton main kya hota he
 Kapil Mishra, recalling Prime Minister Shapathgrahan wrote that Modi ji gave the first blow to India when Nawaz Sharif was called as special guest in his swearing in as soon as he won the Lok Sabha elections
 us din un donon kii body language kahin se aisi nahin thi kii do dushman desh ke netaa hon
 The warmth of their relationship and the gifts being given to each other's families were as if two brothers had met
 kai baar hui donon kii guftgutab se modi ji or navaj sharif ne ek-duusare se milane kaa koi mauka nahin choda
 Be it Paris's Climate Summit or Russia's SCO Meet, Bangkok or Shanghai or Washington
 donon ne kuch na kuch rasta nikaal hi liya, akele guftgu karne kaa
 To spend some time together
 kapil ne likhaa he ki search karen to aisi saikadon tasviren hai, jahaan donon ek-duusare se akele main, alag baaten karne main vyast hai
 There is no official other than these two in these cases
 kahin ek sofe ke kone main donon baton main mashgool hai
 Somewhere hugging, walking hand in hand
 jaise koi bahut hi gupt va vyaktigat baat ho
 Like a deal
 modi-navaj kii mulaakaat ke baad pathankot par hamalous din to puri duniya hi jhatka kha gai thi, jis din modi ji achaanak navaj sharif ke ghar main kisi janmdin kii party main pahunch gaye the
 Even on that day there was a long talk between Modi and Nawaz Sharif in private
 charchaa he vahaan kuch chuninda bahut bade vyapaaree bhi maujuud the
 What happened that day, why did Modi go, no one knew anything
 lahore vaali mulaakaat ke chand dinon ke andar hamaari vayusena ke pathankot sthit airbase par aatanki hamalaa hota he
 It was one of the largest attacks on Indian military installations till date
 ISI pahunchi pathankot airbasekapil mishra ne nishaanaa sadhate hue likhaa he ki modi ji kii sarkaar nepthankot hamaleki jaanch ke liye ISI ko bulaane kaa nirnay kar liya
 The same ISI that always attacked our country, got the soldiers killed
 wo hi ISI jisane pathankot par hamalaa karavaaya
 We are all witnesses to the dark and disgusting day when ISI officials were going to investigate their own attack inside the smiling Pathankot airbase and the brave soldiers of our forces were engaged to provide security to the ISI Like a VIP is protected
 'desh ko bataai jaae rishton kii sachai'ab samay aa gaya he ki desh ko bataaya jaaya ki itane dinon se modi ji or navaj sharif ke bich kya khichdi pakaai ja rahi thi? ab vakt he ki desh ko bharose main liya jaaya ki kya modi ji or navaj sharif main koi gupt deal hui he? pichley dinon hui itani sari gupt mulakaaton main aakhir kya baat hui, kya nirnay hue, ab desh ko bataae jane chahie

 The fury of anger in the mind of young Karunanidhi was ignited when he saw his teacher undressing and bare body worn on his upper limbs before going to the upper caste people
 3 june, 1924 ko tiruvurur ke paas tirukkulai main pichde isivalar samudaay ke mutuvellar or anjugam ke ghar janme karunanidhi jati vishmata se vidagdh ho chuke the or pratadiaon ko chupchaap sah lene kii nichali jati ke logon kii aadat se kam umr main hi baagi tevar vaale ho gaye the
 He later ensured 69 percent reservation for backward castes and was honored as 'samuga Nidhi Kavalar (guardian of Social Justice)' for these efforts
 unhone vargaheen samaaj kaa sapana dekha, jisamen rajyabar main samtuwapuram naamak samudaayon kaa nirmaan kiya gaya, jahaan sabhi jatiyon or dharmon ke log ek saath rahaa karte the
 Karunanidhi's political struggle began when he was just 13 years old when he took part in the state-level agitation against the compulsory education of Hindi in Madras Presidency schools
 ek kinvadanti yah he ki unhone apni hatheli ko katkar khun nikaala or usase tiruvarur kii deevaaron par 'tamil waja' (tamil jindabad) likhaa, jahaan unhone apni schuli shiksha praapt kii thi

 When Annadurai broke away from Periyar, Karunanidhi also joined him

 Annadurai became the Chief Minister and Karunanidhi became the Minister of Public Works
 lekin anna lambey samay tak jivit nahin rahe
 When the question of succession came up in 1969, a close friend and fellow artist MGR helped Karunanidhi to be elected party leader
 mjiaar ne 1971 main party ko chunaav jitaane main bhi madad kii
 Karunanidhi was close to MGR but was cautious about giving him any official position

 pichley kuch samay se test cricket main niraashajanak pradarshan ko bhulaate hue team india shuukravaar se australia ke khilaaf shuru ho rahitest sirismen sakaaratmak shuruyaat karnaa chaahegi
 With the victory in the first Test, Mahendra Singh Dhoni would like to put pressure on the team Kangaroos
 captain kool dhoni ke dhurandharon kaa lakshya apni sarajameen par ek baar phir khud ko aparaajey sabit karnaa hoga
 Last year England defeated India 2-1 in the Test series and left no stone unturned to honor India
 duusari ore australia kii nazren england ke pradarshan ko dohraane par hogi
 There has been a very exciting battle between India and Australia on the cricket field in the last few years
 cricketpremiyon ko is baar bhi aisi hi ummid hogi
 Sachin Tendulkar & Co
 will face a fast attack with the presence of Peter Siddle, Mitchell Starc and James Pattinson
 vahiin phil hughes, mathew vade, aid kowan or david warner ko aar aswin, harbhajan singh or pragyan ojha kii spin tikdi kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 Australia announced their last XI 48 hours ago
 team main ekmaatr spinner ke rup main nathan leone ko liya gaya he
 Siddle will lead Australia's fast attack
 moijes henrics ko tej gendbaaji ke kaaran hi glen maxwell par tarjeeh dekar team main shaamil kiya gaya he
 Shane Watson will play as an all-rounder
 sahvaag ke saath koun karegaa pari kaa aagaaj?bharat ko antim ekadash chunane se pehle kaaphi maathapai kerani hogi
 To begin with, Tovindra Virender Sehwagka will be the opening partner
 philhal daud main murali vijay sabase aage hai jinhone irani trophy main shatak jamaaya
 Delhi opener Shikhar Dhawan has also done well this season
 vah dilli or kshetreey team ke liye sahvaag ke saath khel bhi chuke hai
 Dhawan Khabbu is also a batsman, so the team management can take the left right combination
 bhartiya madhyakram kii kaman pujaara- tendulkar ke haathateshwar pujaara, sachin tendulkar or viraat kohli madhyakram main tisaren se paanchaven sthaan par utrenge
 This could be Tendulkar's last Test series against Australia, so he would like to make it memorable
 madhyakram main team prabandhan ravindra jadeja or ajinkya rahane main se ek ko chunegaa
 Being an all-rounder, Jadeja may get preference
 vahiin rahane ke hone se ballebaaji ko gaharaai milegi
 Suspense on the combination of Indian bowling will also have to be seen whether India land three spinners in the form of Harbhajan, Ashwin and Ojha or keep one out
 england ke khilaaf nagpur main bharat ne jadeja, aswin, piyush chawla or ojha ke rup main chaar spinner utaare the or ek bhi nahin chal sakaa tha
 On playing Jadeja, Dhoni will also have a problem facing Harbhajan and Ashwin
 ojha kaa khelnaa tay he or dhoni kii pasand aswin honge lekin tamilnadu kaa yah of spinner pichley chah maheene se kharaab farm main he
 On the other hand, Harbhajan's record has been good against Australia and the same team had named Bhajji as 'turbator'
 chepak kii pich dhimi he lekin aakhri charan main tej gendbaajon ko reverse swing mil sakati he
 India does not have the expertise of reverse swing like Zaheer Khan
 ashok dinda ke paas vividhta nahin he
 Bhuvneshwar Kumar lacks pace and has not bowled more than the old white ball in odis
 australian ballebaajon kii agniparikshaaustralia ke liye yah siries uske ballebaajon kii agnipariksha hogi kyonki uske paas riki ponting yaa mike hassi nahin he
 Barring Kwan and Watson in both practice matches, no one could face the home-based spinners like Parvez Rasool, Rakesh Dhruv and Jalaj Saxena
 madhyakram main captain maaikel clark chot se ubarkar gaye hai
 The same is the case with David Warner
 donon timen is prakaar hai:bharatramhendra singh dhoni, virendra sahvaag, murali vijay, shikhar dhawan, cheteshwar pujaara, sachin tendulkar, viraat kohli, ajinkya rahane, ravindra jadeja, aar aswin, harbhajan singh, pragyan ojha, eshanth sharma, ashok dinda, bhubaneshwar kumaar
 Australia: Michael Clarke, Ed Cowan, David Warner, Phillip Hughes, Shane Watson, Moises Henriques, Matthew Wade, Nathan Lyon, Peter Siddle, Mitchell Starc, James Pattinson, Glenn Maxwell (12th player)
 spes main rahane vaale estronaut ke sharir main kya-kya badlaav hote hai kya kabhi iske bare main sochaa he
 To know this, NASA conducted an experiment
 jisamen paaya ki spes main rahane se maanav sharir main kaaphi badlaav hote hai
 Because of which their DNA also changes
 jane kaise nasa ne in sabhi baton kaa pataa lagaaya
 This is how the experiment first started NASA chose twin brothers Scott Callie and Mark Callie
 nasa ke mutabik is prayog ke liye vah ek dam sahi vikalp the
 Both are astronauts
 maanav sharir main badlaav jaanchane ke liye saal 2015 main scot ko spes main bheja gaya jahaan unhone 340 din bitaye
 During this time his brother Mark was on earth
 jab scot dharti par waapas lauten to nasa ne unke puure sharir ko parkhaa or pataa lagaaya ki unka sharir unke judwa bhai mark se kitna alag he
 Before the experiment, NASA scientists had taken the data of both brothers, after which the data was compared
 jaane- spes main kaise sote, khate or bathroom jate hai estronautye mili parinaam- data ke vishleshan main immune system, haddiyon ke gathan, dharti ke vayumandal se dur rahane ke baad unke DNA par asar dikhaa
 Millions of people have grown and unemployed in India, do not have a job! - During the research, scientists found the most surprising conclusion that Scott's telomeres (repetitive sequences at the end of the chromosome) had increased while living in space
 lekin dharti par waapas aane ke baad lambaai phir se kam ho gai thi
 Significantly, when a person is old, his telomeres become smaller
 - isi ke saath scot ke DNA unke bhai ke DNA se alag paae gaye
 RSS was established in this house, now it takes 58 thousand branches! Christopher Mason, a leading Investigator of NASA, says that this is a great experiment for twin brothers
 DNA main parivartan ke saath hi scot ko ankhon or immune system kii samasya se jujhna padaa

 The Greek skeptical philosopher Diogenes lived in a pipe
 ek din jab vah khuli dhoop kaa seven kar rahe the, tatkaaleen vishwavijeta sikandar mahaan unke paas aakar bolaa, "kya main aapaki kuch madad kar saktaa hum
 
 
 ? "to that the ecstatic philosopher replied," Yes, there is a work you can do for me

 The first question in this should be raised on the definition of 'khushali'
 kya bairal main rahane vaale diogeness ko is report ke anusaar kisi bhi kone se khush vyakti kaha ja saktaa he
 
 
 The What he also asks from the world leader is sunshine, which is available in abundance, and which is beyond the index of happiness
 diogeness ke uttar kaa kya prabhaav us 23-varshiya noujvaan par padaa hoga, kya khushhaali kii gananaa karte samay isaki upeksha kii jaani chahie
 
 
 ? On the basis of the six main elements on which 'happiness' is calculated, there is a clear neglect of purely psychological symptoms

 In fact, these are 'city states' in the name of the nation, whose proper system is not a challenge in itself
 yahaan sabase zyaada gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki ye sabhi desh pashchimi europe kii tathakthith aadhuniktaa se dur apane paramparaagat mulyon se abhi bhi gahare rup se jude hue hai
 Therefore, there is a sense of social harmony here

 However, who will take over the post of Delhi CS, has not been announced yet
 bataa den ki anshu prakaash apane kaarykaal ke dauraan kaaphi charchaa main rahe
 The case of him being beaten up by AAP legislators was in dispute
 jisaki jaanch ab bhi jari he
 Actually Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash had gone to the Chief Minister's residence to attend a meeting late on 19 February this year
 aarope he kickejarivalke saamne AAP vidhayakon ne unke saath marpet kii thi
 Former MLA Sanjeev Jha, who was present there during the uproar at Kejriwal's house, had denied the Chief Secretary's allegations
 unka kahana tha ki mahaj 3 minute main unke saath marpet kaise ho sakati he
 He said that the discussion on the ration issue had started, but instead of listening to the conversation, the Chief Secretary said that he is not accountable to them

 The army's displeasure is also that it was given such a small amount in this year's budget that it is inadequate in terms of raising equipment for the 10 (I) scenario

 The Army spends 83 per cent of its budget on capital expenditure, salaries, maintenance of its equipment and facilities
 raksha mantralay ke think tanks istitute of dephence studies and analisis main raksha bajet par nigaah rakhane vaale lakshmana behara bataate hai, "trend sanket karte hai ki rajasav or puunjigat vyay kaa anupaat aane vaale varshon main 60:40 ke adarsh anupaat se ghatakar 90:10 ke behad kharaab anupaat tak pahunch saktaa he
 The army is forming a new mountain strike corps for which 88,000 soldiers will be recruited
 (british sena main kul 80,000 sainik hai) itane nae sainikon kii bhartee se 64,000 karod kaa atirikt kharch badhegaa
 Two divisions ‚Äî 56 and 71 ‚Äî have been made in Panagarh's 17-core
 do nae divijan kaa gathan abhi hona he
 In 2014, the UPA government had approved in 2014 a very fast pace for this corps being specially prepared for limited offensive action by entering into China in the event of war on the border, but the annual 10,000 required for its formation and decoration Did not provide a budget of Rs
 bajtiy andekhi kaa daur endie ke shasankaal main bhi jari rahaa
 As a result, the army has to prepare for the strike corps from the wasted portion of its weapons and ammunition which it keeps separately for use in the event of war
 kahaan to is kor kaa gathan yuddh kii sthiti main china ko munhtod jawaab dene ke liye kiya janaa tha, vahi ab yah ek aisa safed hathi banataa ja rahaa he, jo sena ke aadhunikeekaran ke bajet ko chat kar rahaa he
 It is not that the army is not aware of the consequences of recruiting new soldiers
 sena ke persepective planning nideshaalay ke paas "ribalance and ristraccharing'' naam se taiyaar ek masauda he, usamen bhartee se upajane vaali sthitiyon ke bare main avgat karaayaa gaya tha
 The study was carried out in 2012 on the instructions of the then Army Chief General Bikram Singh, during which the army was pressing for the formation of Mountaine Strike Corps
 is adhyayan main khaastaur se do binduon ko dhyaan main rakhkar sena ke bajet par aane vaale atirikt bhaar kaa akalan kiya gaya tha‚Äîsaatvaan vetan ayog jisase vetan or pension donon main badhotaree hoti or doosraa nae strike kor ke gathan ke liye hone vaali nai bhartiyon ke liye aavashyak kharch
 The alarming figures presented in that report will cost an average of more than 12 lakhs per year on additional military personnel
 report ne ek rasta bhi sujhaayaa tha‚Äîuplabdh sanybal main se hi chhaantkar strike kor kaa gathan hona chahie or isse atirikt phogiyon ko bhartee karne kii jarurat nahin padegi
 The army rejected this study with the fear that the bureaucracy would later stop approving more recruitments as needed
 sena adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki is avishvaas ke peeche ek ahm kaaran yah bhi tha ki sena apane sanyakarmiyon main katautee karke jo dhan bachaati he vah sena ke paas nahin jaataa balki vah bharat ke samekit nidhi main chalaa jaataa he
 This happens because the expenditure on human resources comes from the revenue budget, while the purchase of equipment is from the capital budget
 raksha mantralay ke purv vittiya salaahkaar (adhigrahan) amit koshish kehete hai, "rajasav bajet main bhi vetan or anya suvidhaon ke liye aavantit dhan ko duusare kaaryon main nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 But the Finance Ministry can do this and there are many such examples in the past
 '' ve kehete hai, "is kami, khaastaur se patibaddh dendariyon ke kaaran paidaa kami, kii bharpai sena ke bajet ke madon main aantarik punarmoolyankan athwa kul puunjigat laagat main se duusari sevaaon / vibhaagon ke paise ko transfar karke hi karnaa sambhav he
 "the second option is to ask the Ministry of Defense for additional funds for that year or in the revised estimate stage
" aisa tarksangat prayaas aakhri baar 20 saal pehle general ve
 P
 malik ne kiya tha
 On being assured that the army would use the money it would save by cutting its forces to purchase military equipment, it ordered a deduction of 50,000 such military personnel who are not deployed in the field
 lekin raksha mantralay apane aashwaasan se peeche hat gaya or iske agle hi saal kargil kii ladaai chhid gai to sena ne bhi is prastaav ko aage nahin badhaayaa
 The army was facing a huge shortage of ammunition in the Battle of Kargil
 khaastaur se 155 mimi boforce hovitger topon ke liye gola-barood kii kami thi jisane is ladaai kaa ruukh palat diya tha
 General Malik made a famous statement that the army "will fight what is available"
 kareeb do dashak baad unke uttaradhikari or maujuuda sena pramukh general vipin ravat bhi us puraani niti kii taraf hi bad rahe hai
 The army has now adopted the "priority mantra" of the government
 28 march ko general ravat ne kaha, "jo bajet uplabdh he usee ke madon main pher-badal or samaayojan karke sainya taiyaariyon ko ucch praathamikta di ja sakati he
 It cannot be said that there is no need of housing for the families but they can stay for a few days for this
 ham bajet ko sainya taiyaariyon ke liye focus karne hetu bajet ko santulit kar rahe hai
 In an inaugural address of the Half Yearly Conference of Army Commanders in New Delhi from 16 to 21 April, General Rawat stressed that "proper determination of priorities is needed so that the resources available are maximized and the army modernized
" Do not interrupt the process
 ''sena ne apane gola-barood kii baari kami kii baat ko saarvajanik kar diya jo ki abhootpurv he
 The army said that it had only 10 days of stock worth fighting tanks for ammunition, anti-tank missiles and smart rockets
 bharat kii sainya taiyaariyon ke nirdhaaran kaa lambey samay se mukhya aadhaar yah he ki "yadi bharat-pakistan ke bich yuddh chhid jaae to china usamen nahin koodegaa lekin yadi bharat-china ke bich yuddh chhid jaae to pakistan nihsandeh yuddh main kudakar ladaai kaa morcha khol degaa
 The Army and Air Force are deployed on two fronts
 china ke khilaaf uttari morche par or pashchimi morche par pakistan ke khilaaf
 And when fighting on only one front, a decisive victory can be achieved by putting the entire army, fighter aircraft and resources on one front
 lekin agar donon morchon par yuddh chhid jaataa he to sansadhano kaa ek morche se duusare morche par bhejnaa sambhav nahin hoga
 For a decisive victory, full deployment and preparation will have to be done on every front
 do morche par yuddh hua to kai baar iske dhaai morche ke yuddh (aadha kashmir or uttar-purv ke aatanki gatividhiyon ke kaaran) main badal jane kii bhi puri ashanka he
 This can also not be ignored during military preparations and during the preparations there should be full scope for assessment of every possible threat and danger
 is baat ko lekar koi bahes nahin ho sakati, iske baavjood kuch sena commander jin par hi yuddh ke sanchaalan kii vaastavik jimmedaari rahati he, is par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 In a seminar held in Chandigarh on March 1, Army Commander of the Western Command, Lt Gen Surinder Singh, said that the thought of fighting on two fronts under the current circumstances would be "not a wise move"
 mana ja rahaa he ki do morche par yuddh se jude vichaaron ko saarvajanik rup se vyakt karne par sena pramukh ne naaraazgi jaahir karte hue unhen aagaah kiya he
 Half-hearted reform The disease of the Indian Army is much deeper than it appears
 ye koi aise masale nahin hai, jinka hal sirf zyada paisa uplabdh karaane se nikaala ja sake
 Probably the root of each problem lies in India's defunct high defense management, including the military struggling with the fund crunch and ongoing modernization at a slow pace
 sakasham raksha prabandhan ke tahat sansadhano ko susangat bananaa hoga or unka aavanton praathamikta ke aadhaar par karnaa hoga
 For example, the US National Security Strategy prescribes a national military strategic policy that the United Army must adopt
 sashastr senaayen sakhti se sanyukt balon kii kaman ke tahat ekikrut hoti hai
 All five countries have one thing in common, sitting at the highest level of the United Nations Security Council
 unke paas aise sainya audyogic parisar hai jinase yah sunishchit hota he ki ve aayaat par nirbhar na rahen or unke paas gaharaai se ekikrut fouj he jinka bhavishya kii chunautiyon se nipatane ke laayak banane ke liye aadhunikeekaran kiya ja rahaa he
 India also aspires to enter the Security Council
 sarkaar ne mek in india ke tahat swadeshi raksha utpaadakon ko praathamikta di he, par ucchstareey sainya sudhaar or dirghakaalik niyojan ke maamle main sarkaar sust he
 For example, there is no national security strategy here, India is yet to achieve the operation guidelines of the Defense Minister and they too are based on the input of the armed forces
 suraksha vishleshkon ne 2017 ke sashastr balon ke sanyukt siddhant ko mahaj ek majaak maanakar khaarij kar diya he, kyonki isamen na to niyojan, na kharid or na hi sanchaalan main koi saamanjasy dikh rahaa he
 Irked by the lack of cohesion between services, the Navy withdrew its Strategic Andaman and Nicobar Command in 2016, which it had offered to bring under rotation after the Army and Air Force
 2017 main sena ke think tanks centre for land warfare studies main pesh ek paper main leftinent general compoj ne is baat ko rekhaankit kiya he ki ekikrut fouj ke abhaav main kya hota he
 It added, "the Indian Army plans to go ahead and fight on-the-ground battles independently, similarly the Air Force will focus on aerial combat and naval maritime combat, reconciling resources and operations among all There is not enough partnership
 ''lagaataar do samitiyon, 2001 main tatkaaleen grih mantri laalkrishna adwani kii adhyakshata vaale mantri-samooh or disambar 2016 main leftinent general di
 B
 shekatkar kii adhyakshata vaali samiti, ne ek chif of dephence staff (sidies) kaa pad srujit karne kaa suzav diya tha
 a post that will have a four-star officer of any one service, who will not only act as a one-time military advisor to the government, but will also promote jointness and prioritization for specific needs in the Armed Forces budget
 sarkaar ko abhi sidies kii niyukti par sakriy hona he, jo phijulkharchi par sawaal kar saktaa he, jaise pichley saal sena dwaara 65 karod dollar ke saude main chah mahange apache helicopter ganship kii kharid karnaa, jabaki vaayu sena ne pehle hi 22 aisi mashine kharid rakhi thim
 This neglect is clearly visible now because the government clearly does not believe that the fight on two fronts can be a reality
 ek varisht adhikari ne is puri bahes ko "anupyukt'' bataaya or kharaab se kharaab paristhitiyon ke liye taiyaar rahane kii nirarthakta par jor diya

 An informal conference with Chinese President Xi Jinping by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Wuhan is an attempt to reduce tensions on the border
 bhartiya sena ko iske liye taiyaar hone main samay lagegaa, kyonki jaisaa ki sashastr sena kaa tark hota he, iraadaa raturaat badal saktaa he, lekin sainya kshamta banane main dashakon lag jate hai
 One of Xi Jinping's first goals after assuming office in 2012 was to reduce the size of the 2
3 million strong People's Liberation Army (PLA) to one million (see, a new aspect of the Red Army) and more recently his goal By 2035 it is to make its army a reduced-sized, agile and technology-based one
 bharat kaa rajnatik netritv sashastr sena main zyada sankhya ke prati chaikas rahaa he
 Citing a rare example of dissatisfaction with this, Prime Minister Modi said at a Joint Commander's Conference held in December 2015, "while the superpowers are cutting down their army and becoming more dependent on technology, we are still our army Want to increase the size of
 ek saath hi sena kaa aadhunikeekaran or vistaar karnaa kathin he or anaavashyak lakshya he
 "there has been little work on suggestions to re-prioritize military resources

 The DPC, headed by Doval, is expected to be able to move forward on these reforms

 punjab main ek baar phir khalistaan samarthak aatankwaadiyon kii gatividhiyaan bad gai hai
 On 21 May, Punjab Police and BSF arrested two Khalistani terrorists from Ajnala near Amritsar in a joint operation while taking delivery of weapons from Pakistan
 ab mangalvaar ko punjab police kii intelligence wing or mohali police ne saajha oparation main khalistaan jindabad naam ke ek nae teror modul kaa khulaasa kiya he
 The conspiracy to smuggle Punjab, the four terrorists of the Punjab Police and the BSF, have revealed this new khalistanterer module during interrogation
 pakade chaaron aatanki is modul ko khadaa karne kii koshish kar rahe the
 According to the information, Congress leaders Sajjan Kumar and Jagdish Tytler, who were the main accused in the 1984 Sikh riots, were targets of these terrorists
 saath hi punjab main sikh dharm ke granthon kii brudabi karne vaale log bhi inke nishane par the
 The attempt of these terrorists was to disturb the peace of Punjab in a major incident
 videshon se mili aarthik sahaytamohali ke esaspi kuldeep chahal ne jaankaree dete hue bataaya ki in aatankiyon ko videsh main baithe khalistaani samarthakon kii ore se funding kii ja rahi thi
 In Mohali and Chandigarh, pro-khalistan sleeper cells were helping to shelter these terrorists
 in aatankiyon kii koshish thi ki un logon par hamale kiye jaaen jo ki sikh virdohi hai or uske baad sikhon kaa bhaavnaatmak samarthan hasil kiya jaae
 These terrorists also wanted to carry out a major incident to incite violence in the border areas
 pakistan, england or canada main baithe khalistaan samarthak punjab ke yuvakon ko fasebuk or anya soshal media par aatanki gatividhiyon ke liye taiyaar kar rahe the
 Terrorists who exposed the conspiracy of the Khalistan Zindabad have also prepared a new module named Khalistan Zindabad
 ye sabhi aatanki hathiyaar kharidne or aatank failaane ke liye fund ikattha karne kii koshish main bhi lage hue the
 On May 26, 5 people were arrested by Punjab Police in Bathinda, Punjab
 ve log lutpaat karte the lekin jab in logon se poochtacha hui to pataa laga ki ye paanchon hi khalistaan samarthak aatanki hai
 They used to do robbery to buy weapons as well as to collect money to pursue their mission
 unki nishandehi par hi police ne chandigarh ke najadik mohali main chhip kar baithe in chaar aatankiyon ko giraftaar kiya he
 The woman also came to know about the intentions of these four terrorists involved in the conspiracy, and the police found out that the Khalistani terrorism which they believe is over in Punjab
 pakade gaye chaaron aatanki uski jaden jamaane ke liye kaam kar rahe the
 They also included a woman
 mahila kaa naam amritpal cor he, jo ludhiana kii rahane vaali he
 She was involved in this terrorist module
 aatank ke liye istemaal kiye jane vaale hathiyaaron ko chhipaakar ek jagah se duusari jagah pahunchaana or paise ke lenden ke liye vah mahila hone kaa phayda uthaati thi
 Every terrorist had a mission woman besides a terrorist named Jarnail Singh Lal
 jiskaa kaam vaardaaton ko anjaam dene or hatyaein karne ke liye hathiyaaron ko ikattha karnaa or puri ranneeti bananaa tha
 Similarly, the mission of Randeep Singh, another terrorist, was to remain active on social media and connect the youth with pro-khalistan thinking with their modules
 saath hi vah videsh main baithe khalistaan samarthak logon se funding or duusari madad hasil karne kii jimmedaari bhi sambhaal rahaa tha
 The third terrorist Harvinder Singh was instrumental in building this new terrorist module
 videsh main baithe hue khalistaani samarthakon or aatankiyon ko khalistaan ke paksh main taiyaar karne main harvinder ek ahm kadi tha
 According to SSP Kuldeep Chahal, the Punjab Police has abolished this new Khalistani terrorist module
 lekin police ko ashanka he ki modul abhi bhi punjab main failaa hua ho saktaa he
 For this reason, these terrorists have been taken on 7 days police remand
 police inase ye pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahi he ki punjab main khalistaani aatankwaad kii jaden is modul ke madhyam se kahaan-kahaan tak fail chuki hai
 Who are the pro-khalistani and terrorists sitting abroad who were providing all help to make this module stand in Punjab
 khulaase ne udayi suraksha agenciyon kii neendis nae aatanki modul kii jaankaree ne punjab police ke saath-saath kendriya suraksha agenciyon kii bhi neend uda di he
 According to information received from the sources, along with the Home Ministry team and the Central Intelligence team, several central security agencies are also gathering information from these terrorists about pro-khalistani terrorists and the entire module
 pakade gaye aatankiyon se lagaataar poochtacha kii ja rahi he

 purv grih sachiv aarake singh maanate hai ki ab bharat ke liye daaud ko baahar pakadana behad mushkil ho gaya he
 Speaking to NDTV, RK Singh said, "now Dawood is not going to be extradited
" pakistan pehle se is baat se hameshaa manaa karata rahaa he ki daud pakistan main he
 ' darasal daaud kaa maamla bharat main ek raajnneetik maamla bhi ban gaya he
 It came to light several times that Dawood has been visiting Pakistan and Dubai
 uski beti kii shaadi bhi badi khabar bani
 It can be captured only when India can pressure Pakistan with solid intelligence
 ye pahal grih mantralay ke bayaan ke saath bharat ne philhal kho di he
 The comments mumbai ke purv police kamishnar or bijepi saansad satyapal singh kehete hai pratyrpan ke liye zaruri hota he ki ye saboot bhi pesh kiya jaae kii apradhi kahaan chipa he
 Satyapal told NDTV, 'we can apply for extradition only when evidence is found
 ' That means Dawood's extradition to India - that is, it will not be possible to arrest and bring him from outside, unless it is clear where he is
 ab sawaal ye bhi uth rahaa he ki daaud ko lekar bharat ke raajnneetik dal bas narebaazi karte hai yaa sarkarein vaaki use waapas laane kii koi koshish kar rahi hai? Actually Dawood's case has also become a political matter in India
 ye baat pehle kai baar saamne ai ki daaud pakistan or dubai aata-jaataa rahaa he
 The marriage of his daughter also became a big news
 use tabhi pakadaa ja saktaa he jab bharat pakistan par thos kufia soochnaaon ke saath dabaav bana sake
 India has lost this initiative with the statement of the Ministry of Home Affairs
 tippaniyan Satyapal Singh, a former Mumbai police commissioner and BJP MP, says extradition requires proof of where the culprit is hiding
 satyapal ne enditivi se kaha, 'jab saboot milegaa tabhi ham extradishan kii arzi de sakate hai
 ' yani bharat ke liye daaud kaa pratyrpan- yani baahar se use giraftaar karke laana tab tak mumkin nahin hoga, jab tak ye saaf na ho ki vah kahaan he
 Now the question is also arising that do political parties of India simply raise slogans about Dawood or are the governments really trying to bring him back? mumbai ke purv police kamishnar or bijepi saansad satyapal singh kehete hai pratyrpan ke liye zaruri hota he ki ye saboot bhi pesh kiya jaae kii apradhi kahaan chipa he
 Satyapal told NDTV, 'we can apply for extradition only when evidence is found

Indian boxer Shiva Thapa (56 kg) crashed out of the Rio Olympics on Thursday in the first round match against fourth seed Cuban Robesi Romarez
 apane duusare olympic main hissaa le rahe 22 saal ke shiv ko ekatarfa mukaable main 0-3 se shikast kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 During this match, he also got a cut on his left eye
 pehle round main donon mukkebaajon ne satark shuruyaat kii
 Both boxers are familiar with each other's sports while playing in junior tournaments
 donon youth vishwa championships or youth olympic 2010 ke final main ek duusare se bhid chuke hai
 Prior to today's match, Romirez won both his matches against the Indian boxer and did not have much trouble in registering a third win today
 tippaniyan In the London Olympics, the gold medalist of the flyweight category, Romirez, collected some fine-grained boxes with the right hand
 cuba ke mukkebaaz ne shandaar footwork dikhaaya or shiv ke dephence ko bhedane main kaamyaab rahe
 In the second round also, World Championship bronze medalist Shiva had to fight against Romirez, who was also getting full support from the spectators
 tisare round main bhi kuch nayaa dekhne ko nahin mila or romirej ne dabadabaa banaae rakhte hue jeet darj kii
 Shiva had to face defeat in the first round itself even when he made his Olympic debut four years ago
 bhartiya ummiido kaa bhaar ab vikaas krishna (75 kigra) or manoj kumaar (64 kigra) par he jo donon pre quarter final main jagah bana chuke hai
 Significantly, Thapa is also ranked sixth in the world rankings of his class, but he failed to get preference due to some irregularities by the ad hoc committee
 antarrashtriya mukkebaaji sangh (eibie) dwaara banaae gaye nae mukkebaaji niyamon ke mutabik olympic main variyata peshewar mukkebaaji (apibi) or mukkebaaji vishwa siries (dablyooesbi) main kiye gaye pradarshan ke aadhaar par tay honi he
 The ad-hoc committee did not inform the Indian boxers of this rule, due to which Thapa did not participate in APB
 jisase unhen pehle daur main cuba ke variyata praapt mukkebaaz se bhidana padaa
 Both boxers started cautiously in the first round
 donon mukkebaaz junior toornamenton main khilne ke dauraan se ek duusare ke khel se parichit hai
 Both have competed against each other in the final of Youth World Championship and Youth Olympics 2010
 aaj ke mukaable se pehle romirejane bhartiya mukkebaaz ke khilaaf apane donon match jite the or aaj teesri jeet darj karne main bhi unhen adhik mashkkat nahin kerani padi
 The comments landan olympic main flivet varg ke swarna padak vijeta romirej ne daayen haath se kuch dhansu mukke jamaaye
 The Cuban boxer showed superb footwork and managed to penetrate Shiva's defense
 duusare round main bhi vishwa championships ke kaansya padak vijeta shiv ko romirej ke khilaaf jujhna padaa jinhen darshakon kaa bhi puraa samarthan mil rahaa tha
 Nothing new was seen in the third round as well and Romirez dominated the game to win
 shiv ko chaar saal pehle olympic main padaarpan ke dauraan bhi pehle daur main hi haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Indian hopes now weigh on Vikas Krishna (75 kg) and Manoj Kumar (64 kg), who both qualified for the pre-quarterfinals
 gauratlab he ki thapa bhi apane bharvarg kii vishwa ranking main chathe sthaan par hai, lekin vah tadarth samiti dwaara kuch gadabadiyon ke kaaran variyata paane main asafal rahe the
 According to the new boxing rules made by the International Boxing Association (AIBA), preference for the Olympics is to be decided on the basis of performance in professional boxing (APB) and Boxing World Series (WSB)
 tadarth samiti ne bhartiya mukkebaajon ko is niyam kii jaankaree nahin di jiske kaaran thapa ne apibi main hissaa nahin liya
 That led them to meet the Cuban seeded boxer in the first round

 Daundiyakheda village of Unnao was a simple village till yesterday like other villages around it
 lekin jab se puraatatv vibhaag ne dondiakheda kile main gade khajaane kaa pataa lagane ke liye khudaai shuru kii, tab se puure desh ke nazren is gaanv or kilen par aakar tik gayi hai
 Everyone is desperate to know the history of Daundiyakheda village and the fort located there
 to ham bataate hai, dondiakheda or iske kile kaa itihaas
 Daundiyakheda formerly known as Dronikhetra or Dronikher
 chandragupta maury kaal main yah ilaaka paanchal praant kaa ek hissaa tha
 At that time the terrain of 400 to 500 villages was called Dronimukh
 dondiakheda ko un gaanvon ke kendra hone ke kaaran dronishetra ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 That is why the area was very important, as well as a military officer of the king lived here with his army
 is gaanv main bane kile ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki yah kila chandragupta maury ke kaal se bhi pehle bana tha
 According to the famous archaeological architect Alexander, this was the famous city called Ayomukh (haymukh), Gautam Buddha
 jahaan par harshavardhan kaal menchini yatri havensang aayaa tha
 It is said about the fort at Daundiyakheda that this fort was initially occupied by the brothers
 bharon se is kile ko jeetne ke liye bainso ne kai baar koshish kii lekin asafal rahe
 Later around 1266, Sederayi, son of King Karanarai of Banso, finally won the fort from the Bharas
 jiske baad is kile par baison kaa adhikaar ho gaya or ye rajya baisavaara ke naam se prasiddh hua
 Daundiyakheda was its capital

 Who strengthened this fort
 kile ke andar hi do naye mahal banawaaye or kilen ke adanr 500 or baahar 1 xxrep 4 0 sainikon kii tainaati kii
 Tilokchand is said to be known as a very close associate of Bahlol Lodi, the emperor of the Delhi Sultanate
 tilokchand ke kaal main hi unke rajya kii seemaa kaa kaaphi vistaar hua or unka rajya kalpi, mainpuri se lekar manikpur (pratapgarh) or purv main baharich tak fail gaya
 After hanging the last king Rao Rambaksh Singh by the British, this fort was attacked and destroyed and later handed over the broken fort to another king Baisa Digvijay Singh (muraramau)
 baison ke pramukh rajya kii rajdhani hone ke kaaran kilen or nagar nasht hone ke baad bhi iskaa mahatv baraabar bana rahaa
 If we talk about the geography of the fort, then this fort is 33 miles southeast of Unnao district which was built on a huge mound 50 feet high
 pashchim kii ore ganga nadi kii dhara tile ko chooti hui bahati he or kile kaa mukhya ddhaar purv kii ore tha
 The fort was approximately 385 feet in length from the front and the rear was somewhat wider than this
 kile kaa kshetrafal bhi lagbhag 1,92,500 varg feet tha
 The fort was surrounded by 30‚Äì32 feet thick walls of mud and around 50 feet wide moat around the fort, which was always filled with water and this fort was considered to be one of the impregnable forts of India at that time
 lekin british senapati sar hope grant nen 1858 i0 main is kilen kojitkar ise tahas nahas kar diya tha

 # TZH azaad hindustan main asainik sangharsh ke itihaas main oparation blue star sabase khooni ladaai thi
 The army launched a campaign to control Janrail Singh Bhindranwale and his small detachment, who were hiding near the Golden Temple in Amritsar with their armed companions
 ise oparation blue star kaa naam diya gaya
 In this operation machine guns, light cannons, rockets and finally fighter tanks had to be tried
 is oparation main sikhon kaa sarvocch sthal akaal takht bhi tabah ho gaya
 The then PM Indira Gandhi ordered to wipe out the militants from the Golden Temple
 oparation bluestar main 83 senakarmi or 492 naagarik maare gaye the
 Operation Blue Star was a campaign launched by the Indian Army from June 3 to 6, 1984 to free the Harimandir Sahib complex in Amritsar, Punjab, from pro-khalistan pro-general Jail Singh Bhindranwale and his supporters
 bataaya jaataa he ki us daur main punjab main bhindrawaale ke netritv main algaavvaadi takatein shashakt ho rahi thim, jinhen pakistan se samarthan mil rahaa tha
 Due to this, the situation in Punjab was very bad at that time
 punjab main is samasya kii shuruyaat 1970 ke dashak se akali raajnneeti main khinchataan or akaliyon kii punjab sambandhit maangon ke rup main hui thi
 In 1973 and 1978, the Akali Dal passed the Anandpur Sahib resolution
 mul prastaav main sujhaayaa gaya tha ki bharat kii centre sarkaar kaa keval raksha, videsh niti, sanchaar or mudra par adhikaar ho jabaki anya vishyon par rajyon ko purna adhikaar hon
 They wanted autonomy in the northern region of India
 unki maang thi ki chandigarh keval punjab kii hi rajdhani ho, punjabi bhashi kshetra punjab main shaamil kiye jaaen, nadiyon ke pani ke mudde par sarvocch nyaayalay kii raay lee jaae, 'naharon ke hedworks' or pen-bijli banane ke moolbhoot dhaanche kaa prabandhan punjab ke paas ho, fuj main bhartee kaabiliyat ke aadhaar par ho or isamen sikhon kii bhartee par lagi kathith seemaa hataai jaae, tathaa akhil bhartiya gurudwara kaanoon banaaya jaae
 The support and influence of the Akalis began to grow
 isi bich amritsar main 13 april 1978 ko akali kaaryakartaaon or nirankariyon ke bich hinsak jhadap hui thi
 13 Akalis were killed in it
 rosh diwas main sikh dharm prachaar kii sanstha ke pramukh jaranel singh bhindranvaale ne bad-chadhakar hissaa liya tha
 Many observers see this incident as the beginning of extremism in Punjab
 bharat kii tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi par sikh samudaay main akali dal ke janaadhar ko ghataane ke liye jaranel singh bhindranvaale ko paroksh rup se protsaahan dene kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa he
 The Akali Dal remained in the political mainstream of India and was talking about the demands of Punjab and Sikhs, but its attitude was considered lax
 jaranel singh bhindranvaale ne inpar kadaa rukh apanaaya or centre sarkaar ko doshi tehraana shuru kar diya
 Bhindranwale regularly gave speeches on controversial political issues, religion and dignity
 unhen ek tabake kaa samarthan bhi milane laga
 Violent incidents started happening in Punjab
 sitambar 1981 main hindi samachar patr punjab kesari akhbaar samooh ke sampadak lala jagat narayan kii hatya kar di gai
 Violent incidents occurred in Jalandhar, Taran Taran, Amritsar, Faridkot and Gurdaspur
 bhindranvaale par hinsa bhadakaane ke aarope lage
 The police continued to take action, saying there was not enough evidence
 sitambar 1981 main bhindranvaale ko mahataa chowk gurudware ke saamne giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Meanwhile, there was a shootout between the huge crowd and the police
 gyaarah vyaktiyon kii maut ho gai
 a period of violence started in Punjab
 iske kuch hi din baad sikh chaatr sangh ke sadasyon ne air india ke vimaan kaa apharan kar liya
 Seeing Bhindranwale getting public support, Akali Dal leaders also started making statements in support of him
 1982 main bhindranvaale chowk mahataa gurudwara chhod pehle swarna mandir parisar main guru nanak nivas or iske kuch maheene baad sikhon kii sarvocch dharmik sanstha akaal takht se apane vichaar vyakt karne lage
 The Akali Dal launched its 'canal Stop Front' in July 1982 against the construction of sutlej-yamuna Link Canal
 jiske tahat akali kaaryakarta lagaataar giraftaariyaan de rahe the
 Meanwhile, from the Golden Temple complex, Bhindranwale started a new campaign for the release of his fellow All India Sikh Students Union chief Amrik Singh
 akaliyon ne apane morche kaa bhindranvaale ke morche main vilay kar diya or dharm yuddh morche ke tahat giraftaariyaan dene lage
 Violent incidents began to escalate
 patiala ke police upmahanireekshak ke daphtar main bam visphot hua
 The then chief minister of Punjab, Darbara Singh, was also attacked
 april 1983 main punjab police ke upmahanireekshak e
 s
 attawal ko din dahaade harimandir sahab parisar main goli maar di gai
 Police morale kept falling
 kuch maheene baad punjab roadways kii ek bas main ghuse bandookdhaariyon ne jalandhar ke paas kai hinduon ko maar daalaa
 The Indira Gandhi government sacked Darbara Singh's Congress government in Punjab and imposed President's rule
 lekin punjab kii sthiti bigadati gai
 By March 1984, 298 people had died in violent incidents
 indira gandhi sarkaar kii akali netaaon ke saath teen baar baatcheet hui
 The last phase of negotiations broke down in February 1984 when violence against Sikhs took place in Haryana
 1 june ko bhi swarna mandir parisar or uske baahar tainaat kendriya reserve aarakshi bal ke bich golibari hui
 Sant Jarnail Singh, court-martialed Major General Subheg Singh and the Sikh Students Federation had set up considerable barricades around the Golden Temple complex
 unhone baari maatra main aadhunik hathiyaar or gola-barood bhi jamaa kar liya tha
 Just before the general elections in 1985, Indira Gandhi wanted to solve this problem
 antat unhone sikhon kii dharmik bhavanaaen aahat karne ke jokhim ko uthaakar bhi is samasya kaa ant karne kaa nishchay kiya or sena ko oparation blue star karne kaa aadesh diya

 Surprisingly, in the year 1870, the black law called sedition, which was included in the Indian Penal Code with the intention of perpetuating colonial domination and terror, in 1870, at the rate of pandemonium, is now being given to the people of this independent country for a different reason
 Is being imposed: printing a wrong map of the country, not standing on the national anthem in the cinema hall, liking a Facebook post, calling a yoga guru a thug, rival crick Not to raise the morale of the team, make cartoons of leaders or shout slogans

 The story of the book begins
 darasal pataa hi nahin ki kahani kab shuru hoti he or kis taraf jaati he
 Cyrus himself says more than a dozen times in the book that the story begins now
 haalanki ye baat wo sens of humar kii sens main likhte hai
 But the reader tries to enter into the story, leaving this unsuspecting sensation out of the category of non-sense
 'netagiri' kii kahani kuch yun he ki ek kaalpanik desh he gyandustaan
 No one knows where this country is
 lekin iskaa ek shahar he, jiskaa naam he 'be'
 In the city of 'bay' there is a family named 'husky'

 In the country of Gyanadostan, Cyrus creates some imaginary and playful characters
 ye kirdaar apane aap main satake hue hote hai
 Those who would have walked, would have come out of the book and cheated some with you
 lekin shukr he ki kitaab se baahar nahin aa sake
 The President of Gyanadostan, Colonel Jaggi, is seen trying to follow in the footsteps of Saddam, Gaddafi and Hitler
 lekin desh ko lekar wo kitna gambhir he
 The idea of this is known by the fact that he likes to go to every big meeting, by removing his clothes, that is, completely naked
 haa, kai baar juraaben pahan liya karata tha
 The responsible but self-effacing character is determined to bring the Colonel to the throne

 'netagiri' also gives us a lesson

 So it is better for your relationship

 Why not read 'netagiri' if your hand is tight in English, then this book is not for you

 The beginning of the book 'netagiri' is very ripe
 kitaab kii kahani ko samajhane kii koshish karata pathak, kai baar sirus ke majaak ko nahin samaj paata he
 For this reason, people who decide to read the book by reading a few pages of the beginning can decide not to read it
 kitaab ke kuch hisson main kisson ko ghasita gaya he, khaastaur par disuja kii baton ke matlab bataane main
 However, if you somehow finish a quarter of this book, then it is also certain that you will read the rest of the book fast and it also succeeds in bringing laughter on your face
 aap agar gambhir kahaniyon or kitabon ke shaukeen hai, to maaf kijiega, yah kitaab aapke liye nahin he
 Why read 'netagiri' 'netagiri' is an average laughing book
 lekin sirus ne behtareen tareeke se kitaab ke kirdaaron kaa namakaran or unako pesh kiya he
 While reading the book, you can make your mind tear up the ears of these characters
 kahani main jaan foonkane kaa kaam bhi in kirdaaron ke jariye sirus ne kiya he
 Apart from this, if you have not read any book full of sense of humor till date, then this book is for you
 sirus behtareen sens of humar vaale hai
 Its glimpse is also seen in 'netagiri'
 hansane kii tamanna liye logon main agar uparokt gun hai to wo 'netagiri' ko ek baar pard sakate hai
 It is in a round-the-clock but also political understanding that everything is fair in love, war and 'netagiri'

 The NDA-1 government reduced interest rates to boost the economy
 vaajapeyi kii aarthik nitiyon ne jo neenv rakhi, usee par manmohan singh ko bharat kaa sudhaar purush kahalaane kaa gaurav praapt hua
 Vajpayee did not become Prime Minister as a dynasty or head of state or a powerful Union Minister
 sidhe prasaaran vaale tivi ke is daur ke kaaphi pehle ve bharat ke bade hisse main jananetaa kaa khitaab hasil kar chuke the
 i remember that i was three km away from Yamuna in Delhi to listen to his speech
 paidal chalakar pahunchaa tha
 They ruled both your heart and your mind
 ve aise pratik the jinke prati aadar umadta tha, khauf nahin
 Neither bow down, nor has the Parliament become a battlefield of loud statements and noise over the last decade
 apni raajnneeti upar rakhane ke liye vikaas main adangha lagaana ravaayat ban gai he
 Vajpayee's record as an MP is unmatched on both a good orator and a firm democrat
 ve aaj bhi sabhi dalon main apane udaar samparkon ke liye jane jate hai
 While he was a young MP, he may have clashed with Jawaharlal Nehru on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, but Vajpayee's tribute to Panditji's death was the most emotional
 unhone kaha, ‚Äújyoti agyaat main samaa gai
 "later, Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi jailed him in the Emergency
 unhen ek surgery karwaani padi or baari peeth dard jhelana padaa lekin unhone chikitsakeey aadhaar par jail se baahar aane kaa vikalp nahin chunaa
 He used to say, "we can break, we cannot bow down
" ‚Äùvaajapeyi ke vyaktigat or rajnatik darshan kaa aadhaar yah manyata thi ki bharat na tuutegaa, na jhukegaa
 He realized that consensus was the only mantra for economic reforms, as he was running a coalition government in which there were allies with different opinions
 gathjod dharm hi unka mantra tha
 He told me in an interview, "we are not going to start reforming
 ham to narsingh raav sarkaar or sanyukt morcha sarkaron ke shuru kiye kaam ko aage badha rahe hai
 But we can take credit for broadening and accelerating the reforms
 ‚Äù teen varisht netaa, jo pradhanmantri bane, narsingh raav, chandrashekhar or vaajapeyi aksar rashtriya muddon par ek-duusare se raay-mashvira kiya karte the
 One morning, sometime in mid-july of 1998, i went to meet him at 7, Race Course Road
 vaajapeyi apane chaar mantriyon ke saath the
 There was a discussion on action against Sonia Gandhi
 jab sabhi bol chuke to ve apane saathiyon ke badale meri ore mukhaatib hue, ‚Äúeditor ji, aisa karenge to phir congress or bijepi main fark kya hoga
 "this gave a glimpse of Vajpayee's perspective: not a change, but go according to the law
 pehali mahila videsh sachivvidesh sachiv lalit maansingh 2001 main ritair hue or tab france main bharat ke rajdoot kanwal sibbal us pad kii daud main sabase aage the or jaswant singh kii pasand bhi the
 Jaswant Singh had received approval for his appointment, although the turn of about half-a-dozen senior officers from Sibal was being crossed
 tabhi vaajapeyi ke ek bharosemand adhikari ne bataaya ki chokila ayyar ke paris ke pad par daawey ko andekha kar diya gaya he
 Vajpayee asked for his file
 is tarah ayyar desh kii pehali mahila videsh sachiv baniin
 Vajpayee was perhaps the first leader in South Asia to establish one of his ideologies, Vajpayeeism
 marks or maao ne logon ko khooni kranti karne ko uksaaya lekin vaajapeyi ne 25 partiyon kii sarkaar chalaate hue chamatkaar kar dikhaaya, jinke bich gathjod ke naam endie ke alaava kuch bhi saajha nahin tha
 Vajpayee had unique qualities of good use, not abuse of power
 1996 main jab unki sarkaar 13 din main hi gir gai to vaajapeyi ne sansad main apane rajnatik virodhiyon se kaha, ‚Äúham aapako bharosa dilaate hai ki jo kaam hamane rashtrahit main shuru kiye hai, unhen puraa kiye bagaiyr chaiyn se nahin baithenge
 After two years of winning the next election, Vajpayee proved his point by forming the government
 may 1998 main vaajapeyi sarkaar ne pokaran main parmaanu pareekshan karke duniya kii mahashaktiyon ko chaunkaa diya
 It was named Operation Shakti
 unhone laal bahadur shastri ke naare ‚Äújai jawan, jai kiyaan‚Äù main ‚Äújai vigyaan‚Äù kaa udghosh joda
 Friends can change, not neighbors
 Like Indian Prime Minister, Vajpayee's dream was to leave his legacy as a permanent peace with Pakistan
 ve 14 or 16 july, 2001 ke bich pakistan ke raashtrapati parvej musharraf se agra main mili
 On the last day, the general told the editors present that no agreement can be reached without including Kashmir
 iske baad vaajapeyi ne shikhar sammelan ke aakhir main tay saajha bayaan jari karne se manaa kar diya
 Earlier in 1999, he had made a historic trip to Lahore by bus and met Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
 vahaan unhone kaha tha, ‚Äúdost badal sakate hen, padosi nahin
 We can either be like friends or keep fighting and keep getting mocked in front of the world
 ‚Äù13 disambar, 2001 kii subah paanch aatankwaadi sansad bhawan parisar main ghus gaye
 He gunned down nine people with bullets and later died at the hands of security forces
 tab laalkrishna adwani or sena pramukh general sundarji nirnaayak karrwai ke paksh main the
 But Vajpayee's policy of "speak sweetly, pick up the stick" had a huge impact
 vaajapeyi ke daur main hi kashmir main pehle swatantra or nishpaksh chunaav hue jisase puraa maahaul hi badal gaya
 When the status of the BJP grew in the 1990s, its leadership fell on the shoulders of Advani and Vajpayee

 Advani became the new Rama by the Rath Yatra
 bahultavaadi vaajapeyi aakraamak hindutv ke paksh main nahin the, haalanki ve party ke vafaadaar sadsy bane rahe
 Vajpayee has always remained mysterious about the Babri Masjid demolition
 gujarat main 2002 ke dangon se narampanthi hindutv vaali party kii bijepi kii chhavi kamjor padi to vaajapeyi tay nahin kar paa rahe the ki narendra modi ko gujarat kaa mukhyamantri rahanaa chahie yaa nahin
 non-bjp leaders asked Vajpayee to remove Modi
 unhone aresas netritv ko sandesh bheja ki modi ko janaa padegaa
 Ultimately, the RSS convinced Vajpayee in the interest of the party
 haalanki jab tak vaajapeyi satta main rahe, aresas pramukh ve
 Sudarshan, vhp's Ashok Singhal and Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh's Dattopant were targets of a throbbing thong

 Rumors of midterm elections were floating around
 adwani pehle hi ‚Äúindia shining‚Äù (bharat udai)naare kaa aagaaj kar chuke the jabaki chunaav usee saal aakhir main hone vaale the
 i asked Vajpayee if the BJP would contest early
 unhone jawaab diya, ‚Äúprashn hi nahin uthta
 Elections will be held on time
 ‚Äù lekin baad main adwani, muralimanohar joshi, venkaiya naidu, pramod mahajan or duusare bijepi netaaon ne pradhanmantri ko manaa liya
 However, Vajpayee knew that he was writing a farewell from the country with a leader of magical, magnetic charm and a huge heart
 yah atal bihari vaajapeyi kii viraasat kaa saar he
 Despite retiring from politics, he remains elder than every party or organization
 aakhir ve bharat se jo jude hai
 It is Vajpayee's aura, which will last forever

 Whenever i have gone to the American department store, i have seen the glut of milk cartons but there was no curiosity
 is baar montere ke ek store main sangeeta ne kaha ki yahaan sabase peeche doodh ke utpaada rakhe hote hai kyonki uski bikri koob hoti he
 Keep the most back so that when you come to buy, then you can also look at the remaining things and be inspired to buy
 phir wo mujhe store ke sabase akhir main rakhe doodh ke rack kii taraf le gayi
 i started noting how many types of brands and products
 har utpaada ko ek duusare se alag or shreshth bataane ke liye avyavon main kitna baarik or haasyaaspad antar kiya gaya he
 Understanding these differences will not make you a Gopal, a scientist will definitely make you

 ayodhya maamle (ayodhya Case) kii sunwaayee supreme court kii paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth karegi
 The case will be heard on January 10
 sunwaayee karne vaali samvidhan peeth main chif justise ranjan gogoi, justise ese bobade, justise envi ramana, justise yuyuu lalit or justise divai chandrachud hai
 The Supreme Court has issued a circular regarding the hearing of the Ayodhya case by the Constitution Bench
 sunwaayee karne vaali bainch main chif justise ke alaava ve chaar jaj hai jo bhavishya main chif justise banenge
 There is no Muslim judge in it
 purv main supreme court ne tay kiya tha ki ayodhya maamle kii sunwaayee ab 10 janvari ko nai bench karegi
 This bench was said to be formed before January 10
 mangalvaar ko is peeth kaa gathan kar diya gaya
 The bench of Supreme Court Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi ended the previous hearing in barely half a minute
 sunwaayee main kaha tha ki nai bench ab is maamle main aage kii aadesh jari karegi
 With this, it was also clear that the new bench will decide when to hear the case
 nai bainch hi yah faisla karegi ki maamle kii sunwaayee niyamit kii jaaegi yaa nahin
 Significantly, advocate Hari Nath Ram has said in the petition that the matter cannot be deferred indefinitely and the Supreme Court should hear it soon
 ayodhya maamle kii sunwaayee ke liye navgathit samvidhan peeth abhootpurv bench maani jaaegi
 For this, the Supreme Court has issued a circular
 ye chif justise ranjan gogoi kaa apratyaashit kadam he
 His five-judge constitution bench's administrative order is contrary to the three-judge judicial order which refused to send the case to five judges
 das janvari ko yah tay ho saktaa he ki ayodhya maamle kii sunwaayee kis taarikh se hogi
 It will also be decided whether this case will be heard daily? Normally when a constitution bench sits on an issue, it hears the same case
 aisi sunwaayee hafte ke mangalvaar, buudhvaar or shuukravaar ko hoti he
 The special thing is that on 27 September 2018, a three-judge bench turned down the demand that Ismail Farooqui be sent to the Constitution Bench to reconsider the 1994 Judgment, which said that offering prayers in the mosque Is not an integral part of Islam
 iske baad teen jajon kii peeth ko maamle kii sunwaayee kerani thi
 After this, the constitution bench of these five judges was now formed

 The complaint of the National Herald case was made by BJP leader Subramanian Swamy
 unhone kaha tha ki sonia or rahul gandhi ne neshnal herald kii paanch hazaar karod kii sampatti par kabja kar liya he

 Nawaz has been playing the 'sympathy card' continuously since the day he was sentenced by the court
 navaj sharifko bhrashtachar ke maamle main us samay sajaa sunai gai jabpakistanmen chunavi maahaul he or 25 july ko desh main aam chunaav hone ko he
 Nawaz Sharif's party Pakistan Muslim league-n's position was not being reported well until 3 weeks before the election

 Interestingly, after Jahanwajki's arrest in Lahore, party workers are celebrating his return to his home country, rather than mourning his going to jail
 unke desh laut aane se kaaryakartaaon main josh kaa nayaa sanchaar paidaa ho gaya he or yahi utsaah ab chunaav tak bana rah saktaa he
 Vote on Nawaz's 'martyrdom' This is a unique opportunity for the PML-NK through which it can reactivate its workers about 2 weeks before the vote and go to the voters and ask them to vote on Nawaz's 'martyrdom'
 aisa hua to ek ke baad ek sankaton se jujh rahe sharif parivaar ke liye phir se achche din kii shuruyaat ho sakati he
 Soon after Nawaz, who was playing a 'sympathy card', announced a sentence by a Pak court last week, Nawaz PC in London with his daughter Maryam, described himself as a victim and said he was not a thief and would soon return to Pakistan 
 unhone kaha, 'meraa jail se sangharsh jari rahegaa
 This is a part of my struggle
 'tab unhone 'sahanubhuti card' khelte hue kaha tha, 'main vaada karata hum ki meraa sangharsh tab tak jari rahegaa jab tak desh ke logon ko kuch general or jajon kii ore se un par thopi gai daastaa se mukt nahin kara letaa
 i appeal to the country that they come with me and do not leave me alone in this fragile moment
 ' unhone jald hi swadesh waapas lautne kii baat kahi thi
 Within a few days of this, Nawaz announced his return home with his daughter
 unki vaapasi kaa elaan karnaa tha ki pakistan sarkaar unako giraftaar karne kii yojanaayen banane lag gai
 But Nawaz did not want to let his arrest go to U
 maa ne bhi khelaa 'sahanubhuti card'giraftaar hone se pehle unhone har hatkande apanaae
 He came to the press with his daughter and then tried to prove his suffering as a victim to the Pak public by referring to his wife Kulsoom Sharifka
 ise unki sochi-samajhi ranneeti kaa hissaa kaha ja saktaa he
 Kulsoom hospitalized in London is suffering from cancer and his condition is very critical
 duusari ore,pakistanmen rah raheen navaj kimaa samim akhtarane guuruuvaar ko video sandesh jari kar kaha ki vah bete navaj or potee mariyam ko akele nahin chodengi
 If Nawaz was imprisoned, she would also go to jail with him
 donon nirdosh hai or unke khilaaf sajeesh kii ja rahi he
 Before leaving for Pakistan, Nawaz said, "I am not Pervez Musharraf, who will sit abroad like Buzzdil in hiding
" mere khilaaf jisane sajeesh kii, wo desh ke saath bura khel khel rahaa he
 a similar game was played in the year 1971 and the country was split into two
 'unka is masale par musharraf kaa zikr karnaa behad lajimi tha kyonki navaj kii tarah puure desh ko maaloom he ki paak kaa yah purv taanashaah bhrashtachar ke maamle main desh se baahar bhaga hua he or uski chhavi desh main bahut acchhee nahin he
 Not only Musharraf but many other big and influential leaders of the country also ran out of the country after being accused of corruption and did not come back in front
 jabaki iske ulat navaj ne bhrashtachar maamle main lagaataar sahyog kiya
 Nawaz himself appeared or assisted in the investigation on nearly 90 occasions in a hearing in the Avefield corruption case involving the ownership of four flats in the posh Avefield House in London
 iske baad sajaa kaa elaan hone ke ek hafte ke andar vah khud swadesh laut aae or giraftaar ho gaye
 'dilemma' for Imran Khan: Khair, Nawaz and his daughter Maryam will be arrested from Lahore Airport and sent to Adiala Central Jail in Rawalpindi
 donon kaa passport jabt kar liya gaya he
 It is very likely that both of them can now file a bail application from the court tomorrow, as per the Pakistani law, the bail application can be filed only if it has surrendered
 donon ke desh laut aane ke baad vahaan ke raajnneetik dalon ko aam chunaav ke liye nae sire se chunavi ranneeti banani hogi kyonki yahaan se piemail-en se anya dalon se badhat bana lee he
 Now Imran Khan has to take over the power of the center, then in the remaining 2 weeks, heel peak will have to be emphasized

 The bjp's terming the apex court's sharp remarks against the central government 'failing' to take appropriate action against those depositing black money abroad and the appointment of the SIT was a 'slap' on the Congress-led UPA regime
 usne centre sarkaar se sansad ke monsoon satr main kalaadhan par sakht vidheyak pesh karne kii bhi maang kii
 BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said, "the Supreme Court's comment against the Congress-led UPA rule about bringing back black money of Indians deposited abroad is a slap in the face of the government
" ‚Äô unhone kaha ki yah sarkaar kii niskriyata kaa pramaan he ki ab adaalat ko bhi sarkaar kii niyat par bharosa nahin rahaa
 The central government has been completely exposed in the light of the court's remarks

 Describing black money as 'very dangerous for the country', the court said that the amount of black money deposited in foreign banks can be considered as a measure of 'weakness' or 'softness' of a country

 The BJP spokesperson alleged that the government is protecting those who deposit corruption and black money abroad
 vah dohare karadhaan bachaav sandhi ke bahaane aise congressiyon kaa bachaa rahi he jinhone pichley 60 varshon main videshon main kalaadhan jamaa kiya he

 rajya ke sammanit isai mishanri prem bhai kii 10veen punyatithi ke maukey par 28 june ko yojit ek kaarykram main mukhyamantri pema khandu ne elaan kiya ki unki sarkaar 1978 main dharm parivartan ko rokane ke makasad se banaae gaye arunachal pradesh dharmik swatantraaa kanoon ko khatm karegi
 The Chief Minister said that this law bans freedom of religion and has no place in secular India
 mukhyamantri ne india today se kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòaaj ke sandarbh main is kanoon kaa isaayiyon, mul nivasee manyataon or kisi bhi duusare dharm ke liye koi matlab nahin he
 This does not cause any harm or help to any religious group
 ‚Äô‚Äôis elaan kii rajya bhar main tikhi pratikriya hui
 The ideological parent of BJP, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, asked the Chief Minister not to carry out this announcement
 aresas ke ek varisht prachaarak ne apana naam ujagar nahin karne kii shart par kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòho saktaa he ki khandu agle chunaav main isai vot hasil karne kii ummid kar rahe hon, par is kanoon ko radd karnaa hinduon kii bajaae rajya ke mul adivaasiyon ke liye kahin zyada bada khatra hoga
 This law was promulgated primarily to prevent indiscriminate conversion of the state's native beliefs and religions into Christianity
 ‚Äô‚Äôsangh ke prachaarak apni daleel ke samarthan main janaganana ke aankade pesh karte hai
 According to the 2011 census, Christians are the largest religious group in the state

 2011 kii janaganana tak hindu ghatakar 29

 2 fisadi rah gaye
 To understand it more thoroughly, it would be interesting to know that 51 of the state in 1981
 6 fisadi bascindia doni-polo or anya sthaneey dharmon ke anuyaayi the
 Although the decline in the number of doni-polo is shocking, many experts say that its followers abandoned this religion due to expensive customs
 magar aresas ke log ise or aage le jate hai
 According to him, "in 1951 there was not a single Christian in the state
 khandu jin prem bhai kii punyatithi ke kaarykram main shariq hue, unhone 25 saal rajya main bitaye the or is kanoon ke tahat unhen kai baar giraftaar kar jail bheja gaya tha
 Arunachal Pradesh was the third state after Odisha (1967) and Madhya Pradesh (1968) to enact and enforce anti-conversion laws
 uske baad uttarakhand (2018), chhattisgarh (2000), gujarat (2003), himachal pradesh (2007) or rajasthan (2008) ne bhi dharmantaran virdohi kanoon banaae or jabaran yaa pralobhan se dharm badalane par kanoonee roak laga di
 Christians have welcomed Khandu's announcement
 arunachal chrishchiyan forum ke netaa toko teki ko lagata he ki khandu ko is kanoon or iske prashasnic durupyog kii nirarthakta kaa ehsaas ho gaya he
 He says, "when Hindus build a temple, they don't need any permission
" par jab ham carch bananaa chaahate hai, to afasar is bekaar ke kanoon kii badaulat kai kism kii rukaawatein paidaa karte hai
 However, some prominent nomads of indigenous religions and beliefs have criticized the Chief Minister's announcement
 unka kahana he ki paaramparik aasthaa paddatiyon or sthaneey samskritiyon kii hifaazat karnaa jaruri he
 The Indigenous Faith and Cultural Society of Arunachal Pradesh and Nishi Indigenous Faiths and Cultural Society, which have been spearheading the fight for the preservation of indigenous religion and beliefs like doni-polo and Rangfra, also called Khandu's move to 'vote bank politics' like the RSS
 Told the result

 " The central government on Monday informed the Supreme Court that obtaining Aadhaar card is voluntary and not mandatory for citizens

 On behalf of retired Karnataka High Court judge KS Puttaswamy, senior advocate Anil Dewan said that the scheme violates the provisions of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki yah yojana svaichhik he lekin aisa he nahin
 The comments unhone kaha ki vivaah ke panjikaran tathaa duusare kaaryon ke liye aadhaar card ko anivaary banaaya ja rahaa he
 The Maharashtra government has recently said that if the parties (bride and groom) do not have an Aadhaar card, then the marriage registration will not take place
 nyaayamoort puttaswami ne apni janhit yachika main is yojana ke amal par roak lagane kaa anurodh kiya he
 The apex court told the Center during the hearing of the petitions filed against the decision of some states to make Aadhaar card mandatory for various activities like payment of salary and provident fund and registration of marriage and property, that the Aadhaar card was not issued to illegal immigrants Be done because it will legalize their stay
 bhartiya vishisht pahchaan praadhikaran or kendra sarkaar ke vakil ne kaha ki jahaan tak kendra sarkaar kaa sawaal he to ham pehle hi spasht kar chuke hai ki aadhaar card svaichhik he
 During a brief hearing on the matter, the bench of Justice BS Chauhan and Justice SA Bobde was told that despite the Aadhaar card being 'voluntary', the Registrar of the Bombay High Court, following an order of the state government, ordered that judges and employees It will be mandatory for the disbursement of salary

 The Gujarat High Court will today hear the final hearing of the petition filed by Zakia Jafri, wife of former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri, one of the state's 2002 riot victims
 zakia jafari ne apni yachika main gujarat ke purv mukhyamantri narendra modi samet 58 logon ko clin chit die jane ke court ke faisle ko chunauti di he
 Zakia Jafri's husband and former MP Ehzan Jaffrey was one of the 68 people who died in an attack during the 2002 riots at the Gulbarga Society in Ahmedabad
 zakia jafari kaa aarope tha ki in dangon main tab ke gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi or kai anya logon kii mileebhagat he
 Zakia appealed in the case to the High Court on March 2014 when the closure report of the Special Investigative Team appointed by the Supreme Court supported the lower court
 nichali court ne apane faisle main kaha tha ki rajya sarkaar ne dangon ke dauraan main sabhi zaruri prakriya puri kii thi or vahaan suraksha-vyavastha barkaar rakhane ke liye har mumkin kadam uthaaya tha
 The comments nichali court, esaiti ke us baat se bhi sahamat thi jisamen ye kaha gaya tha ki narendra modi ne godhra hatyakand ke baad vahaan lau and order banaae rakhane or bigadati sthiti ko sanbhaalane ke liye kam se kam samay main sabhi zaruri kadam uthaae the
 The hearing of the case in the High Court was postponed for almost a year, as the heavy records of the case were to be translated from Gujarati to Hindi
 zakia jafari ke pati or purv saansad ehjan jafari un 68 logon main se ek the jinaki maut ahmedabad ke gulberga sosayadi main 2002 ke dangon ke dauraan hamale main hui thi
 Zakia Jaffrey had alleged that these riots were in connivance with the then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and many others

 God is omnipotent, ahead of whom no one walks
 lekin kai baar aise maukey bhi aae, jab bhagwaan ko bhi jhukne liye majaboor hona padaa
 They too had to pray with folded hands, then the happiness returned to their lives
 sristi kii rachana parampita brahma ne kii, yah to sabhi jaanate hai
 But do you know that once a huge mistake was made from Brahma
 ek aisi bhul, jisase unki patni na sirf unase ruuth gayi, balki hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye unka saath bhi chhod gayi
 Not only this, the result of the anger of the wife was that today the worship of the creator of the world is worshiped only in Pushkar
 dur pahaado kii chotii par virajati hai savitri, parampita brahma kii ardhangini savitri
 But Savitri is angry here, angry
 yahi vajah he ki brahma ke mandir se bilkul alag-thalag unhone pahaad par apana baseraa banaaya hua he
 You must be wondering what is Savitri angry with Brahma? Why does she sit in a separate temple from her husband? The answer to this question is hidden in Pushkar's temple
 yah mandir na sirf brahma or savitri ke bich duuri badhane kii kahani kahati he, balki un donon ke rishte tuutane ke kisse par bhi muhar lagaati he
 Actually, the distance between the Supreme Father Brahma and Savitri increased when Brahma performed a yajna at Pushkar to create the creation
 is yajna main patni kaa baithna jaruri tha, lekin savitri ko pahunchane main deree ho gai
 The auspicious time of worship was passing
 sabhi devi-devtaa ek-ek karke yajna sthali par pahunchate gaye
 But Savitri had no idea
 kehete hai ki jab shubh muhoort nikalne laga, tab koi upaay na dekhakar brahma ne nandini gaay ke mukh se gayatri ko prakat kiya or unase vivaah kar apana yajna puraa kiya
 On the other hand, when Savitri reached Yajnasthali, she was angry to see Gayatri sitting next to Brahma and cursed Brahma
 savitri kaa gussa itane main hi shant nahin hua
 He also cursed the Brahmin who got married that no matter how much donation is received, the Brahmin will never be satisfied
 gaay ko kaliyug main gandagi khaane or naarad ko aaajeevan kunvaara rahane kaa shraap diya
 Agnidev also could not escape the wrath of Savitri
 unhen bhi kaliyug main apamaanit hone kaa shraap mila
 After the anger subsided, Savitri went to the hills near Pushkar and indulged in austerity and then remained there
 kehete hai ki yaheen rahakar savitri bhakton kaa kalyaan karti hai
 The importance of Brahma in Pushkar is as much as that of Savitri
 savitri ko saubhaahgya kii devi mana jaataa he
 It is believed that worshiping here gives Suhag a long life
 yahi vajah he ki mahilaayein yahaan aakar prasad ke taur par mehandi, bindi or chudiyaan chadhaati hai or savitri se pati kii lambii umr maangati hai

 Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan on Thursday rejected the Shiv Sena's appeal to the state government to ban migrants from coming to Mumbai and said all people are welcome in the city provided they do not encroach on the land illegally
 mukhyamantri ne chhatrapati shivaji terminus par ek nai train seva ke udghaatan samaaroh ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòham mumbai shahar main har kisi kaa swaagat karte hai basharte ve kanoonee dhang se aayen tathaa jameen par atikaraman nahin karen yaa gaiyr kanoonee nirmaan na karen
 Chavan's statement came against the backdrop of Shiv Sena leader and Mumbai Mayor Shraddha Jadhav's remark that the state government should focus on stopping the influx of migrants
