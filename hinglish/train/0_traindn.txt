 That time Pakistan itself went to the International Court of Justice and had to face it

 For this reason, the politics here has also developed like a wrestling game
 jab yah rajya 1966 main bana or mere pita kaa hameshaa kii tarah yahaan dand ke bataur sthanantaran hua, tab hamaari chhathvin kii paathya-pustakon ke peeche rajya kaa ek geet chapa hota tha
 i do not remember literally but it was something like, "mhara des Haryana, where milk and yogurt are eaten
" ’’ jald hi soobe kii raajnneeti main dal-badal, kharid-farokht or vidhayakon ko agava kiye jane kaa khel shuru ho gaya or is khel main ek champion kaa ubhaar hua
 His name was Gaya Lal
 pataa nahin unke mata-pita ko yah naam rakhte hue kaise pataa tha ki ve bharat ke sabase kukhyat dalbadalu ke rup main amar ho jaaenge or unke naam se kahawat hi chal niklegi, ‘‘aayaa ram, gaya ram’’
 The people here changed the state song according to their own politics on a politics which later became something like, "mahara des Haryana, where milk-curd food, flour mille na dana, mahara kaam jaana
 ’’haryana is kism kii khurdari or asthir siyasat kaa garh kaise bana, iskaa vishleshan karne ke liye yogendra yadav jaisaa kaabil shaks chahie
 It may have happened because unlike Punjab, it did not fight for the right to the state
 isiilie yahaan rajyastareey apil ke lokapriy netaa bhi nahin hue
 There were many castes and local leaders here
 isiilie vaicharik or rajnatik vafadari kaa koi khaas arth nahin tha jabaki sankhya ke maamle main kisi bhi jati kaa vaise varchasv nahin tha lekin sirf 20 fisadi se kuch upar rahete hue jat sabase taqatvar birdari ban gai
 Even within the Jats, however, there were many rival leaders who formed their clans
 kunbaprast siyasat kaa sabase behtareen udhaaharan taaoo devilal ke rup main dekhne ko mila, jinhen ek baar kisi press conference main jab kisi reporter ne apane bete (chautaala) ko aage badhaane ke bare main sawaal kiya to unka jawaab tha, ‘‘to main kiske bete ko aage badhaaun, tumhaare?’’pratidwandvi jat kunbe jahaan siyasat or takat ke liye ladate rahe, vahiin duusare samudaayon ne khud ko shaharon tak mahadood kar liya or rais hote gaye
 For example, Vinod Sharma and his father
 en
 a new Brahmin family emerged as Sharma who emerged as the king of liquor, real estate and hotel businesses
 isi tarah sirsa main ek asaamaanya kism ke sthaneey netaa kaa ubhaar hua jiskaa janm to aresas kaaryakarta ke ghar main hua tha lekin jisane baad main gudgaanv ke real estate kaarobaar main apni kismat chamakaa lee
 Modi's comment that Haryana is trapped in the game of Kaun Banega Crorepati is a living example of that
 iskaa naam gopal goyal kanda he, jise khud ko ‘‘baniye kaa chhokara’’ kehane main garv mahasoos hota he or jo apni shuruyaat ke taur par baar-baar ‘‘glorious shoej’’ naam kii dukaan kaa zikr karata he
 After being elected as an independent legislator, it saved Hooda's government from falling in 2010 and became a minister
 uske baad uske air hostess kii khudakushi vaali kahani kaa itihaas sabko pataa he
 Today he is out on bail and is gathering huge crowds in the poorest areas of the city
 usne hajaaron logon par apana paisa lutaaya he lekin aap agar use robinhood kah denge to uske samarthak naaraaz ho jaaenge
 After all, he too has made money by selling and buying land, like all other faces of Haryana politics, smuggling some opium! Kanda distributes gifts to the crowds attending his meetings in such a way that Jayalalithaa should also be blushing
 auraten unke paas aashirwad ke liye apane bacchon ko lekar unke paas aati hai
 In Haryana, criminal charges are not an issue among the loyalists, whether they are Chautala or Kanda
 prachaar ke bich mere saath ghoomte hue kanda apane ateet ke bare main mujhe bataate hai ki kaise 13 saal kii umr main unke pita kaa nidhan ho gaya or unhen poochne aresas / jansangh se koi nahin aayaa, baavjood iske ki unke pita sirsa se do baar loksabhaa ke ummidavaar rah chuke the
 Kanda's house is a fort spread over 12 acres, whose walls are made of medieval red sandstone and have high walls over them
 apane guru tara baba ke liye unhone sau acre se zyada jameen par ek mandir parisar banaaya he jisamen sthapit shiv kii murti dilli hawaii adde ke paas lagi murti se bhi vishaal he
 He says, "what can i tell you about my life, except that it is like a fairytale
" ’’ unhen puraa bharosa he ki ve jeetenge or phir unhen jail main waapas nahin janaa padegaa
 Chautala has no such confusion as he knows that he will be returning to Tihar soon
 schuli shikshakon kii niyukti ke maamle main ek kathor nyaayadhish ne unhen is baat kaa doshi tehraaya tha ki apane mukhyamantritv kaal main unhone 3,000 shikshakon kii bhrasht tareeke se bhartee kii thi
 They don't care about it
 unke samarthak poochhate hai ki kya har koi apane logon ko naukari nahin detaa
 Haryana may not be India's most corrupt state, but there is no doubt that the extent of its tolerance for political corruption gives Tamil Nadu water
 sirf yahi nahin, vah behayaayi bhi jisaki pratimurti khud chautaala hai
 They say they will return to jail but that will not make any difference
 ve tihaad jail ke bheetar se hi mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lenge or is maamle main ammaa se to ek kadam aage hi honge jo jail se apni sarkaar chalaa rahi hai
 Chautala says that renunciation is loaded in his veins
 unke pita devilal ne bhagwaan ram jaisaa tyaag kiya tha jab unhone 1989 main chote bhai vishwanath pratap singh ke liye gaddi chhod di thi
 They ask why did they get scared out of jail? After all, he was born to his maternal uncle when Devi Lal was in the British prison, just like Lord Krishna who was born in the prison of maternal uncle Kamsa
 isiilie unka kunba divine bhi he or jail janaa garv kii baat he
 It would be an insult to Behayai to call it Behayi
 behatar ho ki ham vishaal bharadwaj kii film haidar se iske liye shabd udhaar len-yah dussahas ke zyada kareeb he!nijee str par chautaala utane ruukhe nahin hai
 Many times i have had an open conversation with him
 aisi hi ek shaam shaakaahaari bhojan ke dauraan unhone mujhe bataaya tha ki satta ke liye ek vyakti bhookha kyon hota he
 He had said, "when you have power, you torture not only your opponents but also his people, his lowest spoon
 ’’ phir ve apane aakaaon ke paas jate hai or vahaan guhaar lagaate hai ki unhen bachaa liya jaae, lekin vahaan se bhi unhen raahat nahin mil paati
 He had said, "then it is fun to see them suffering
 ’’ unhone kaha ki yahi vajah he ki unke is dhandhe main barason intjaar karnaa bhi behatar he, yahaan tak ki satta paane ke liye jail jane main bhi koi dikkat nahin, taaki baad main iskaa sukh liya ja sake
 They believe with full confidence that Bhupendra Hooda has completed his phase and it is now his turn in the disturbing politics of the state
 yah baat vastav main thik ho sakati thi kyonki jat voton ke buniyadi daavedaar ve hi hai or unki party bhi sakasham or chust-durust he
 But this time an outsider has made a dent in the traditional politics of Haryana, instead of one Jat
 vah narendra modi he
 In his election campaign for Haryana, Modi had said that the people here want hi-fi or wi-fi but their emphasis is only on cleanliness
 yah sunakar aapako aashcharya to hua hoga, lekin kya ve sirf shabdon se khel rahe the?ek baar aap haryana main chaaron ore najar daudakar dekhie
 The dhabas here offer free wi-fi and "DJ Academies" etc
 make hi-fi feel
 kya aapako ab bhi yaad dilaae jane kii jarurat he ki hamaara haryana desh kaa sabase amir praant he? ab khelon ke maamle main hamaari dehati pasand, khurdari siyasat, desi ghi, doodh or bhainson ko ek taraf rakh den or deevaaron par likhi ibaaraton ko phir se padhein
 You will find that Modi is not wrong in reading these

 Let's know what is the whole thing, according to experts, Kim's visit clearly shows that he is under pressure
 fox bijness news website ke anusaar, china ne kim par beijing aane kaa dabaav banaaya he
 The website quoted Gordon Chang, author of the famous book 'nuclear Showdown', that China had put a lot of pressure on it
 gauratlab he ki kim ek baari suraksha bandobast vaali rahasyamay train se ravivaar ko china pahunche the
 He came out of his country for the first time after gaining power in 2011
 chang ne kaha ki kim ke beijing pahunchane kaa pehla kaaran to yahi he ki china ne unhen aane ko kaha
 China was the only support for North Korea, which had fallen apart in costly relations with China, but in the last few years, the relationship between the two countries had become very strict
 sanyukt raashtra dwaara uttar korea par pratibandh lagane kaa china or rus ne bhi samarthan kiya tha
 China had recently halted supplies of oil and other fuels to North Korea, making it difficult for Kim Jong, as they are already facing international sanctions

 North Korea breaks down on import ban! China also banned North Korea's import of iron ore, coal and glass in its country in November
 yah roak uttar korea ke liye america pratibandhon se bhi badi sabit hui he
 This led to the worsening of the Kim regime

 China's seal must be met before Trump meets! According to Chang, Kim is scheduled to meet South Korean President Moon Jae next month

 In such a situation, China felt that he was being marginalized in this area diplomatically, so he sent Kim
 kim kii is yatra se yah tay he ki vah trump se milane se pehle china kii manjuuri lene or usase salaah lene ko taiyaar hai
 Yang Shiyu, China's chief expert on North Korea affairs from the New York Times, says the visit shows that Kim Jong wants to improve his deteriorating relationship with China
 is dabaav kaa hi asar he ki kim parmaanu hathiyaaron ko bilkul tyaag dene to nahin, lekin is kaarykram ko rokane kii sambhaavna par baatcheet ke liye taiyaar ho gaye hai

 kahin aisa to nahin ki aapane haal hi main kisi purush ke saath dating karnaa shuru kiya he or aapako unke bare main kuch khaas nahin maaloom
 They also do very little interaction
 isi baat ko lekar aap pichley kai dinon se pareshaan hai ki kya aap ek sahi purush ke saath date kar rahi hai yaa nahin
 Somewhere they do not do some strange act on the date, which is confusing you
 agar aisa he, to ghabrie nahin
 You can find out from the antics of these lesser-spoken men how they are and can give warmth to your relationship accordingly

 ho saktaa he ki aap unase ummid lagaae baithi hon ki ve aapke kareeb aaen, lekin agar ve date par aapke saath shaareerik sambandh banane se kataraate hai, to unhen shaq kii nigahon se na dekhen
 One reason for this may also be that they are in a dilemma about getting into such close proximity so soon
 agar aap chaahati hai ki ve aapke kareeb aaen, to aapako unhen is baat kaa sanket karnaa hoga ki unke kareeb aane se aapako koi pareshaani nahin hogi
 Cleansing more 
 
 jindagi main aapke saath-saath unhone or bhi kai rishton ko sambhaal rakhaa hoga, aise main ho saktaa he ki aap donon kii pehle se tay date sthagit ho jaae
 If the appointment is postponed, they give you a lot of clarification for it, so there is no need to throw it away
 aapako jarurat he ki is bare main unki puri baat sunen or unhen program dobaaraa banane ke liye kahen

 The common people have been facing difficulties ever since the central government announced the closure of old currency transactions in cooperative banks
 guuruuvaar kii dopaher main jab naumilal haath main ₹500 ke chaar note lekar lakhanu ke mohanlalganj main jila coparative bank pahunche to vahaan ikkaa-dukka logon ko hi dekh kar vah khush ho gaye
 Naumilal thought that he would quickly change his ₹ 2000 and buy some wheat, manure for the fields and some essential household items
 lekin coparative bank ke karmchaaree ne unase jo kuch kaha use sunakar naumilal ke paanv tale jameen hi khisak gai
 The bank employee said that neither his ₹ 2000 can be changed here nor can he deposit it in his account
 note badalane kii jagah use akhbaar main chhapi vah khabar dikhaa di gai jisamen likhaa tha ki coparative bainkon ko puraane note badalane or jamaa karne kii ijaajat nahin he
 a daily wage laborer, Naumi Lal knew about the 500 and 1000 rupee notes being closed, but was confident of his cooperative bank where his uncle opened his account 20 years ago
 tab se lekar aaj tak naumilal naa to kisi or bank main gaya or naa hi usne kabhi kisi or bank main khaataa khulwaane kii koshish kii
 He felt that co-operative bank is the best place for poor people like him
 ghar main aataa-chaaval sab khatmanaumi laal ko aaj paison kii sakht zarurat thi
 There are four children in the family, whom he himself and his wife labor to raise
 aisa kai baar hota tha jab use mazdooree nahin milti thi isiilie usne apane gaanv ke paas hi ek khet batai par le liya
 That is, someone else's farm but Naumilal will work hard with his wife there and he will get half of the crop
 lekin note bandi ke baad naa to aasaani se kaam mil rahaa tha or naa hi kheton main kaam karne ke liye khaad pani kaa intjaam ho paa rahaa tha
 Now the rice and flour in the house was all over
 paanch dinon kii dihadi ke badale die 500 ke notis puure hafte jab sansad main puraa kaa puraa vipaksh modi ke khilaaf ekajute hokar note bandi ke khilaaf muhim chalaa rahaa tha, tab naumi laal in sab se bekhbar ek aadmi ke yahaan mazdooree kar rahaa tha jo apana nayaa makaan banavaa rahaa tha
 Naumilal was happy that a 5-day daily wage was found in such difficult days
 lekin paanch dinon ke baad jab us aadmi ne naumi laal ke haath par mazdooree ke naam par ₹500 ke chaar puraane note rakh die he to naumi laal kaa cheharaa utar gaya
 But the man said that he does not yet have new notes to give and that he can exchange the old notes by taking them to his bank or depositing them in his account
 yah baat naumilal ko kisi ne nahin bataai ki coparative bank puraane note naa to is badal sakate hai naa hi jamaa kar sakate hai
 After that he went to two banks with his old note but before his number came, the bank said that now the money is gone
 coparative bank ke karmchaaree ne jab use yah bataaya kii note badalane kii aakhri taarikh aaj tak hi he, to badahavaas hokar vah ek baar phir punjab neshnal bank gaya jahaan aakhirkaar uskaa note badal diya gaya
 But there are people like Naumilal who have no account other than their cooperative bank
 80 saal ke bujurg shri kishan is baat se hairaan hai ki jo note pichley maheene isi bank ne die the, vahi bank ab ise waapas lene phir kyon manaa kar rahaa he
 Employees of the cooperative bank are upset at replying to their customers
 unhen dar he ki ab logon kaa bharosa coparative se uth jayega or saalon puraane graahak bhi ab unhen chhodkar chale jaaenge
 What to do with the old notes? The government may be claiming that farmers will be helped for fertilizer and seeds, but the reality is different
 uttar pradesh main kisaanon ko khaad bechney vaale saadhan sahakaari samiti ke sachiv kaashi prasad yadav bataate hai ki khaad bechney vaali samitiyon ke bank khate bhi inhen coparative bainkon main he, agar vah kisaanon se puraane note lekar khaad dena shuru bhi kar den to un puraane noton kaa karen kya, kyonki coparative bank unase bhi puraane note lene ko taiyaar nahin he
 Ashish Kumar, an employee of Lucknow District Cooperative Bank, says that this move of the government has led to loss of trust of people from cooperative banks
 gaanv main tamaam kisaan aise hai jinka khaataa coparative bank ke alaava kahin or he hi nahin
 The steps taken to check black money are very heavy for such people
 kisaan kheti kaa kaam-dham chhodkar do hajaar rupaya badalawaane ke liye bainkon kii line main lage hai or unki sunne vaala koi nahin he

 Replying to questions, Moily, however, did not give any indication of what disciplinary action would be taken against the 82-year-old Venkataswamy, the former deputy leader of the party in the Lok Sabha
 moili ne kaha, ‘hamane unki aakraamakata, dweshpurn vyavhaar or unke aise rukh ko gambhirtha se liya he or aise kaaryon par karrwai jaruri he

 According to Rahul Gandhi's promise, after Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, now Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot in Rajasthan is multiplying to give a loan waiver gift to farmers
 rajasthan ke kareeb 59 lakh kisaanon par 99 hajaar karod kaa bainkon kaa karj he
 It has been 2 days since Rajasthan had Ashok Gehlot as Chief Minister and Sachin Pilot as Deputy Chief Minister, but so far both of them are sitting around taking account of Rahul Gandhi's promise to fulfill the promise made to farmers
 mukhya sachiv ke saath afasaron kii baithak main ashok gahalot ne kisaanon ke karj maafee ko lekar khub maathapai kii, lekin ab tak koi hal nikal nahin paaya he
 The problem is that the Rajasthan government does not have any money
 maujuuda bajet main sarkaar ke udhaar lene kii seemaa 28 hajaar karod he jabaki vasundhara sarkaar ab tak 24,557 hajaar karod rupee kaa karj le chuki he
 In such a situation, where the money came from for loan waiver is a big headache
 58 lakh se zyada kisaanon par karjrajya main kul 58 lakh 85 hajaar 961 kisaanon par 99 hajaar 995 karod kaa karj he
 Under this, short-term debt is Rs 77 thousand 668 crore against 47 lakh farmers
 ab sarkaar ko tay karnaa he ki sampurna karj maaf karnaa he yaa phir alpakaaleen karj maaf karnaa he
 What is the limit of the loan to be forgiven because Rahul Gandhi had promised it in the Rajasthan elections but did not say how much will be forgiven and which farmers will forgive
 ashok gahalot kah rahe hai ki rahul gandhi kaa kya hua vaada har haal main ham puraa karenge
 Gehlot arrived at the Chief Minister's residence today and held a meeting with officers in 8 civil lines
 kinakaa karj maaf karen, kinakaa nahinsarkaar banane ke saath hi rajasthan sarkaar ke adhikari sahakaari bainkon ke saath milakar rin maafee kaa khaakaa taiyaar karne main lag gaye hai
 In Rajasthan, more than 18 lakh farmers have taken loans from 30 thousand crore cooperative loan banks
 jabaki vyavsaayik bainkon se kareeb 33 lakh kisaanon ne 54 hajaar karod rupee kaa lone le rakhaa he
 Apart from this, farmers have also taken loans from new and old private banks, overseas banks and other nationalized banks
 sarkaar maathapai is baat par kar rahi he ki yah kin kin kisaanon kaa rin maaf kiya jaae
 Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot says that within 10 days we will fulfill the promise
 khaakaa par vichaar vimarshpailat or gahalot kii din bhar kii maathapai main yah sambhavit sharten nikal kar ai hai
 The first is to waive off short-term agricultural loans of small farmers
 doosraa fasal utpaadan par liya gaya rin hi maaf ho kisi upkaran par nahin
 Third, agricultural loans up to Rs 2 lakh should be waived and the fourth should be loan waivers for farmers with less than 2 acres of land
 lekin abhi tak koi bhi faisla nahin ho paaya he
 The Rajasthan government says that once the cabinet is formed then only after its approval will open the way for farmers' loan waiver

 agar pataa chale ki sabase bade veerta puraskaar paramveer chakra paane vaale shahid kii patni roji roti ke liye dusron ke gharon main chaukaa bartan kar rahi he to ek hindustani kaa sir shame se jhuk jayega
 a message claiming to be similar has been going viral on social media since last few months
 yakeen na ho to google par sirf Story of Birba tip karke dekhie
 All websites, Facebook pages and Twitter posts will be found which narrate one such poignant story of Bir Bahadur Gurung, a resident of Assam
 is kahani ke mutabik bir bahadur gurung kaa bachapan kaa naam birba tha or unhen choti umr main hi bahaduree ke liye raashtrapati dwaara vaali bahaduree puraskaar diya gaya tha
 This story not only gives a detailed account of the events of Birba's childhood but also tells about how he laid down his life for the country while fighting for the last seven years during the Battle of Kargil
 kisi agyaat lekhak dwaara likhi gai yah kahani daawa karti he ki is veerta ke liye paramveer chakra milane ke baad bhi desh unke parivaar ko bhul gaya he or ab unki vidhwaa ko assam ke ek shahar main ghar-ghar jaakar kaam karnaa pad rahaa he
 The story also claims that the people of India forgot Birba, but his story is being taught in schools in Canadian books
 jab ''ajtak'' ne birba kii is kahani kii sachai kaa pataa lagaana shuru kiya to sabase pehle gaur karne vaali baat ye dikhi ki har jagah kahani ke shabd hoobahoo vahi hai
 That is, people are sharing this story written by one person
 yah pataa lagaana bilkul mushkil nahin tha ki bir bahadur gurung naam ke kisi vyakti ko paramveer chakra mila he yaa nahin
 The highest award given for bravery and sacrifice, Paramvir Chakra has so far received only 21 people in India and none of them is named Bir Bahadur Gurung
 kahani main birba ke bachapan main doston ke saath nadi ke kinare ghoomane jaisi baton kaa varnan bhi aise kiya gaya he jaise likhane vaale ne sab kuch apni ankhon se dekha ho
 But the surprising thing is that nothing has been written about which city or village of Bir Bahadur Gurung lived in Assam
 yahaan tak ki jile kaa bhi koi zikr nahin he
 In childhood, it has been said that the President has been given gallantry awards and it has also been said that Birba roamed the elephant on Rajpath
 lekin veerta puraskaar kis saal mila iske bare main kuch nahin likhaa he
 It is written in the story that fourteen years after getting the Bravery Award, Bir Bahadur Gurung died in the war of Kargil
 is hisaab se unhen bahaduree puraskaar 1984 yaa 1985 main mila hoga
 But upon investigation, it was found that in these two years no Bir Bahadur Gurung or Birba had received bravery from the Father of the Nation
 viral postmen kaha gaya he ki bir bahadur gurung kargil yudd ke dauraan ''peak tololing'' par ladate hue shahid ho gaye the, lekin peak tololing ke yuddh main major rajesh adhikari shahid hue the, jinhen marochhaparant mahavir chakra diya gaya tha
 There was no soldier named Bir Bahadur Gurung among those who were martyred here
 bir bahadur gurung naam ke ek sainik pakistan se yuddh main shahid jarur hue the, lekin ye ghatana 1971 main hui thi na ki kargil yuddh ke dauraan
 Another soldier named Bir Bahadur Gurung received the Shaurya Award in 1968, but he was not a martyr
 iske alaava vah assam ke rahane vaale bhi nahin the
 Apparently, the person who created the false story has added the name from somewhere and some incident from somewhere
 kahani ke ant main daawa kiya gaya he ki ye tamaam jaankaree use major general harsh kakkar se mili he
 But Major Kakkar himself denied this on Twitter
 unhone kaha he ki- 'yah massej saraasar jhooth he or kisi shararti tatv ne meraa naam is massej main daal he
 i never write such a story
 'sabase ajeeb baat ye he ki is farji kahani ke mutabik birba kii bahaduree kii kahani canada main aathvin class main angreji kii kitaab main padhai jaati he
 It is beyond comprehension that when Bir Bahadur Gurung had nothing to do with Canada, why would his story be read in Canadian books
 is bare main poochne par sena ke pravaktaa ne kaha,sensopane logon ke parivaar kaa dhyaan rakhane ke liye tamaam vyavstha karti he
 There may be some shortage in this, but he cannot tell the truth of this story
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki bir bahadur gurung kii yah kahani puri tarah se juthi or managasaint he jiskaa makasad bhartiya sena ke manobal ko kam karnaa he

 He said that the Indian government condemned this act

 PM Modi, while speaking on dyslexia during a video conferencing with the students, said something that caused a lot of criticism on social media
 mana ja rahaa he ki piem modi ne dislexia ke bahaane congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or unki maa sonia gandhi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 People did not like this kind of comment of PM Modi and he was criticized a lot
 darasal, beete shanivaar 'smart india hekathon 2019' (smart India Hackathon 2019) ke liye yojit video conference main dehradun kii ek chaatra ne piem narendra modi (PM Narendra Modi) ko bataaya ki yah program dislexia peediton bachche (dyslexia Children) jo padhane-likhane main pareshaani mahasoos karte hai unke liye bhi phydemand ho saktaa he
 The student told PM Modi, "we have an idea for children with dyslexia, who are very slow to read, but have a very good creativity level
 ham yah film 'taare jameen par' main dekh chuke hai
 "on this, PM Modi asked the student whether this program would work for a child of 40-50 years? When the student answered yes, the PM said then the mother of such a child will be very happy
 baharhaal, baat hansi mazaaq main ud gai, lekin dislexia mazaaq nahi gambhir vishay he
 Here we are telling you about dyslexia
 dislexia ek larning dysorder he, jisamen is pareshaani se grasit bachche yaa vyakti ko padhane, likhane or yaad karne main dikkat aati he
 However, dyslexia does not affect their intelligence or knowledge
 dislexia se peedit bacchon or bado ko rozaana kii zindagi jaise skool or offis main likhane or padhane main kaaphi pareshaani hoti he
 Despite all this, a person suffering from dyslexia disorder can be very creative
 aapane 2007 main ai aamir khan kii film 'taare jameen par' dekhi hogi
 The film features a child named Ishaan and suffers from dyslexia
 iskaa jaisaa ilaaj film main samajhaayaa gaya he, asal zindagi main bhi dislexia ko aise hi thik kiya jaataa he
 In order to get children out of dyslexia, they need to understand pictures and basic things to understand every word
 agar koi dislexia se peedit ho to unhen chizon ko samajhane ke liye paryaapt samay or protsaahan dena chahie
 Even more important should be patient with them
 Dyslexia is one of the most common learning disorders that affects 3-7% people, (traits in upto 17-20%)
 It is genetic (heritable) that affects reading, writing and hence learning skills but not a marker for intelligence

 The BJP is stung by the Congress attack
 party kaa kahana he ki congress ko 2014 main jawaab milegaa
 Party vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi even called Rahul the pastor and Sonia as queen-friend
 nakvi ne kaha ki congress kii ghabrahat saaf dikh rahi he or congress modiphobia se grast he
 Before the Congress attacked Modi severely, the Congress on Friday tried to tease Modi supporters by saying that the leaders who solve the problems of the country will come on a 'buffalo', not on a horse
 congressi netaa raashid alvi ne to modi kii tulana yamraj tak se kar daali
 Congress spokesperson Rashid Alvi said in a conversation with reporters, "if Rahul (in the CII general assembly) were hinting about Modi, he would not have been a horse, but a buffalo
" 'congress ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne guuruuvaar ko kaha tha ki yah apeksha nahin kii jaani chahie ki ghode par savaar ho kar koi vyakti aayega or sabhi chizon ko durust kar degaa
 On Thursday itself, Modi had indicated his desire to become Prime Minister at a book release function by expressing a desire to pay off the 'debt of the country'
 is par kataaksh karte hue alvi ne kaha, 'yadi modi dilli main aakar desh kaa karj utaarna chaahate hai to iske liye unhen bhagwaan se prarthana kerani chahie
 ' tata sans kii board kii baithken praaia: shant or purv nirdhaarit muddon par hoti hai
 But the meeting on Monday was not an ordinary one, after which the shocking news of the removal of Cyrus Mistri from the post of chairman of the group came
 NDTV ko tata sans ke board ke do sutron (inamen se ek somvaar kii baithak main maujuud tha) se mili exclusive jaankaree se pataa chalata he ki mistre ko hataae jane ke faisle se bordroom ke andar ugr or apratyaashit maahaul dekhne ko mila
 The exclusion of Mistri was perhaps not deliberately included in the board's agenda
 ek sutara ne NDTV ko bataaya ki board kii baithak ke liye tay muddon ke kisi bhi anya item kii shrenee ke tahat ise baithak main laayaa gaya
 When it was brought to the meeting, it is said that Mistri opposed it, saying that it was a legally incorrect step
 bataaya jaataa he ki unhone tata rule book kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki board ke saamne aise kisi masale ko laae jane se pehle 15 din kaa notice diya janaa chahie, taaki itane samay main vah apni baat rakhane ke liye taiyaari kar sakate the
 The board then told them that they had taken legal advice in support of this decision
 mistre ko vah kanoonee salaah bhi dikhaai gai
 The board kept telling him that this was not a court hearing
 is masale par sirus mistre ne kaha ki vah is nirnay ko chunauti denge
 According to reports, he may knock the door of Bombay High Court on Tuesday on this issue
 isse pehle nau sadasyeey board main se chah sadasyon ne unako hataae jane ke paksh main vot diya
 Two members were absent
 nawein sadsy ke rup main mistre ne is prakriya main hissaa lene se inkaar kar diya
 However, despite this development, he remains a director of the company as well as a member of the Tata board
 tippaniyan a board source told NDTV that the issue of Mistri's removal was being considered for weeks or possibly months
 yah nirnay ''kisi vivaad kii vajah se nahin liya gaya'' jabaki siio ke rup main unke dayaneey pradarshan ke kaaran liya gaya
 He said that at the moment only two of the Tata companies are in profit, the rest are struggling
 jab unase poocha gaya ki mistre ko tata group kii parampara ke vipareet is tarah se kyon hataaya gaya to andruni sutara ne vaishvik hawala dete hue kaha ki jab is tarah ke sheersh padasth logon ko hataaya jaataa he to 'gilotin' drushtikon apanaaya jaataa he
 Exclusive information from NDTV from two sources on the board of Tata Sons (one of which was present at the Monday meeting) shows that the decision to remove Mistri led to a furious and unpredictable atmosphere inside the boardroom
 mistre ko baahar kiya janaa shaayad jaanboojhkar board ke agenda main shaamil nahin tha
 a source told NDTV that it was brought to the meeting under the category of any other item of issues fixed for the board meeting
 jab baithak main ise laayaa gaya to kaha jaataa he ki mistre ne yah kehete hue ki yah kanoonee rup se galat kadam he, iskaa virodh kiya
 He is said to have cited the Tata Rule Book, saying that 15 days notice should be given before any such issue was brought before the board, so that he could prepare to put forth his time
 uske baad board ne unase kaha ki unhone is faisle ke samarthan main kanoonee salaah lee he
 That legal advice was also shown to Mistri
 board unase lagaataar kahata rahaa ki yah koi adaalat kii sunwaayee nahin he
 On this issue Cyrus Mistri said that he would challenge this decision
 reporton ke mutabik vah is masale par mangalvaar ko bombai hai court kaa darwaja khatkhata sakate hai
 Earlier, six of the nine-member board voted in favor of his removal
 do sadsy anupasthit rahe
 As the ninth member, Mistri refused to participate in the process
 haalanki is ghatnakram ke baavjood vah company ke nideshak hone ke saath-saath tata board ke sadsy bane hue hai
 The comments board ke ek sutara ne NDTV ko bataaya ki mistre ko hataae jane ke masale par hafton yaa sambhavatya maheenon se vichaar kiya ja rahaa tha
 The decision was taken "not because of any controversy" while his pathetic performance as CEO
 unhone kaha ki is vakt tata kii anek companiyon main se keval do hi laabh main hai baaki sangharsh kar rahi hai
 When asked why Mistri was removed in a manner contrary to the tradition of the Tata group, the insider said globally that the 'guillotine' approach is adopted when such top-ranking people are removed

 wikileaks founder Julinay Assange is not going to name the difficulties
 vikiliks ke sansthaapak julian asanje ko bada jhatka dete hue ek british adaalat ne asanje kii ore se ek warrant radd karaane kii duusari arji bhi aaj khaarij kar di
 This means that Assange will be arrested if he steps out of the current embassy of Ecuador
 asanje ne 2012 se hi ecuador ke duutavas main sharan le rakhi he
 Judge Emma Arbuthnot dismissed Assange's lawyers' argument that the continuance of the 2012 warrant was no longer in the public interest
 sweden pratyrpit kiye jane ke khilaaf apni kanoonee ladaai ke dauraan asanje ne jamaanat kii sharton kaa ulanghan kiya tha, jiske baad unke khilaaf yah warrant jari kiya gaya tha

 jaj emma ne kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki giraftaar ek uchit jawaab he, haalanki asanje ne apni aazaadee kai saalon ke liye simit kar lee he

 They should have the courage to do so
 is maamle main aage kadam badhanaa janhit ke khilaaf nahin he
 Swedish prosecutors have closed the investigation against Assange, but he may be arrested if he steps out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in Knightsbridge, London
 tippaniyan Assange's lawyers demanded that the warrant be withdrawn as Sweden no longer wanted his extradition
 lekin jaj ne pichley hafte bhi asanje kii yah arji khaarij kar di thi

 com / 9uyinb9b4u bhaajapa saansad subrahmanyam swami ne pradhanmantri modi ko patr likhakar bhartiya reserve bank ke garvanar raghuram rajan ke khilaaf jis tarah ke aarope lagaae hai, patr pard kar lagata he ki ve kisi apradhi ko pad se barkhaast kiye jane kii baat kar rahe hai
 In terms of language and logic, this letter shows how much respect is left for an institution
 yahaan tak likhaa gaya he ki rajan dimaagi taur par puri tarah bhartiya nahin hai
 Ruining the Indian economy
 modi sarkaar do saal puure hone par minute minute apni kamyaabi ke aankade de rahi he, vahiin bijepi ke ek saansad reserve bank ke garvanar par hamalaa kar bataa rahe hai ki audyogic vikaas negative he
 Unemployment has increased due to Rajan
 pradhanmantri ko bheje is patr main likhaa he ki ve raghuram rajan ko garvanar ke pad se turant hataaen
 Swami said that i would like to harm the Indian economy
 rajan kii sochi samajhi saazish se hairaan hum
 Swamy said that in the last two years, bad loans in public sector banks have doubled to 3
 5 lakh karod ho gaye hai
 Dr
 rajan ke kadamon se meraa ye vishwaas ban rahaa he ki wo bhartiya arthvyavastha main baadha pahunchane kii zyaada koshish kar rahe hai
 He kept raising interest rates continuously citing inflation, while the Finance Ministry and the industry urged him to reduce the interest rate to speed up development
 arthvyavastha ko barbaad karne kii saazish kaa aarope behad gambhir he
 In the Rajya Sabha, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said that i know well about Swami's experience and knowledge
 swami ek janemaane arthshaastri hai
 The Finance Minister is praising Swamy and attacking Swami Rajan
 vitt mantri ke taur par jetali or rajan kii nitiyon main fark rahaa he, kuch baaten saarvajanik bhi hui hai magar jetali ne kabhi dayera paar nahin kiya
 He has always been within his limits and said his gestures
 somvaar ko vitt mantri indian viman press kor main mahila patrakaron se baat karte hue kaha tha ki ham donon ke sambandh behad paripakv hai
 Swamy has written in his letter that small and medium industries have been harmed by increasing the rate of interest
 ye kadam aisa he jaise kisi biimaar kii hatya kar di jaae taaki uske sharir kaa taapmaana giraaya ja sake
 According to the claims of the government, if the Indian economy is doing well then why has it had to search for a person about its decline, murder and intrigue
 kya swami ke bahaane ek khalanaayak khoja rahaa he jis par arthvyavastha ke chaupat hone kii javabdehi daal di jaae
 Neither the Prime Minister nor the Finance Minister has publicly condemned, or condoned, Swamy's statement
 swami se pehle bijepi saansad murali manohar joshi bhi 2013 main rajan kii naagarikta par sawaal uthaa chuke hai
 According to the Wall Street Journal Nupur Acharya's report in October 2013, Rajan said in Mumbai that i am an Indian citizen and will always be an Indian citizen
 mujhe is bhartiya naagarik hone par garv he
 Then Rajan said that someone sends him a mail every day and asks if you are Indian or not
 unhone email bhejne vaale kaa naam nahin bataaya
 Raghuram Rajan's interest is that he predicted in a conference called in honor of the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve in 2005 that the world was going to recession

 Who can be upset by Raghuram Rajan's popularity and his active speaking on economic issues
 23 april 2016 ko bloomberg ne ek survey kiya tha
 In this, 13 out of 15 economists have said that Rajan will get another term as Governor
 unka kaarykaal sitambar main samaapt ho rahaa he
 etmarket
com has conducted a survey among readers
 mangalvaar ko chape is survey ke anusaar 69 pratishat logon ne unhone 10 main 10 number diye hai
 87 percent have said that they want them to continue as governor
 is sawaal par ki swami rajan ko chicago bhej dena chaahate hai, 86 pratishat logon ne kaha he ki chicago nahin bhejnaa chahie
 78 per cent of the people disagreed with Swamy's remarks about Rajan
 is survey main 9168 pathakon ne hissaa liya he
 Swami wrote an article in The Hindu on September 18, 2015
 iskaa sheershak tha The way out of the economic tailspin'
 Swamy wrote that the economy is heading towards a major crisis and by early 2016 the economy will crash
 is lekh se teen din pehle bhi swami ne pradhanmantri ko patr likhaa tha or rajan ko nishaanaa banaaya
 Swami wrote that i am forced to tell you that the economy is about to falter
 agar sahi kadam nahin uthaae gaye to november se lekar farvari 2016 ke bich ek bade krash ko taala nahin ja sakegaa
 There was talk of the economy crashing by February
 aadha may chalaa gaya
 Has our economy crashed
 swami kyon jaanboojh kar hauvva khadaa karenge
 By visiting the website of Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Industries, we saw whether due to Rajan, small scale business has been destroyed
 is mantralay kii 2015-16 kii salanaa report main kaha gaya he ki april 2015 se sitambar 2015 tak, sookshm, laghu or madhyam udyogon kii vikaas dar 18
 74%
 2014-15 main yah vruddhi 17 pratishat thi
 There was an increase of 12 percent in 2013-14
 tippaniyan The Indian government website is giving incorrect figures or the owner is misinformed
 30 november 2015 ke apane man kii baat main pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki hamane mudra bank kii sthapana kii he, isaki shuruyaat acchhee rahi he magar raftaar waisi nahin he jaisi main chahta hum
 In the matter of mind, the Prime Minister had said that till that time 66 lakh people have got 42 thousand crores under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana
 pradhanmantri kii man kii baat sahi he yaa swami apane man kii baat kar rahe hai ki rajan kii nitiyon ke kaaran chote udyogon byaaj par karz nahin le paa rahe hai
 According to our research, when Rajan took office in 2013, the interest rate for banks was 7
 50 pratishat thi, is vakt 6
 50 percent
 kareeb ek pratishat kii kami he
 Rajan has reduced interest rates five times during his tenure
 swami kaa koi swami nahin he lekin swami rigerv bank ke jis swami par hamale kar rahe hai uske bahaane kahin ve apni sarkaar ke swami ko bhi to nahin ghaseet rahe? kya rajan ke bare main swami kii soch sarkaar kii bhi he? On completion of two years, the Modi government is giving its minute by minute statistics, while a BJP MP is attacking the Governor of the Reserve Bank and saying that industrial development is negative
 rajan kii vajah se berojgaare badi he
 In this letter sent to the Prime Minister, it is written that he should immediately remove Raghuram Rajan from the post of Governor
 swami ne kaha ki main bhartiya arthvyavastha ko nuksaan pahunchane ke dow
 i am surprised by Rajan's thoughtful intrigue
 swami ne kaha ki pichley do saal main saarvajanik kshetra ke bainkon main bed lons dogune hokar 3
 5 lakh crores
 dow
 Rajan's steps have made me believe that he is trying more to disrupt the Indian economy
 unhone mahangaai kaa hawala dete hue byaaj daren lagaataar badaye rakhin jabaki vitt mantralay or udyog vikaas ko tezi dene ke liye unase byaaj dar kam karne kaa aagrah karte rahe
 The charge of conspiracy to ruin the economy is very serious
 rajyasabha main vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha tha ki main swami ke anubhav or gyaan ke bare main bhaleebhanti jaanata hum
 Swami is a noted economist
 vitt mantri swami kii tarif kar rahe hai or swami rajan par hamale kar rahe hai
 Jaitley and Rajan have different policies as finance minister, some things have also been made public but Jaitley has never crossed the scope
 ve hameshaa apni seemaa main rahakar ishaaron main apni baat kehete rahe hai
 Talking to women journalists in the Finance Minister Indian Women Press Corps on Monday said that the relationship between us is very mature
 swami ne apane patr main likhaa he ki byaaz dar badhaakar chote or manzole udyogon ko nuksaan pahunchaa diya
 This step is like killing a sick so that his body temperature can be dropped
 sarkaar ke daavon ke anusaar agar bhartiya arthvyavastha acha kar rahi he to isaki giravat, hatya or saazish ko lekar ek shaks kii talash kyon kerani padi he
 Is Swamy looking for a villain on the pretext of which to put the accountability of the economy down
 na to pradhanmantri or na hi vitt mantri ne saarvajanik taur par swami ke bayaan kii ninda kii he, yaa usase kinaaraa kiya he
 Prior to Swamy, BJP MP Murli Manohar Joshi has also questioned Rajan's citizenship in 2013
 oktober 2013 main waal street jarnal nupur acharya kii report ke anusaar rajan ne mumbai main kaha tha ki main bhartiya naagarik hum or hameshaa bhartiya naagarik rahoonga
 i am proud to be an Indian citizen
 tab rajan ke kaha tha ki unhen koi rose ek mail bhejtaa he or poochta he ki bataaiye ki aap bhartiya hai yaa nahin
 He did not name the sender of the email
 raghuram rajan kii kyaati is baat ko lekar he ki unhone 2005 main america ke fedral reserve ke purv chairman ke sammaan main bulaae gaye sammelan main bhavishyavaanee kar di thi ki duniya main mandi aa rahi he
 IIT Delhi has been a student of IIM Ahmedabad

 On April 23, 2016, Bloomberg conducted a survey
 isamen 15 main se 13 arthshaastriyon ne kaha he ki rajan ko garvanar ke rup main ek or kaarykaal milegaa
 His term expires in September
 itimarket dot kaam ne pathakon ke bich ek survey kiya he
 According to this survey published on Tuesday, 69 percent people have given 10 out of 10 numbers
 87 pratishat ne kaha he ki ve chaahate hai ki ve garvanar pad par bane rahen
 On the question that Swami wants to send Rajan to Chicago, 86 percent of the people have said that Chicago should not be sent
 78 pratishat logon ne rajan ke bare main swami kii tippanee se asahmati jataai he
 9168 readers have taken part in this survey
 swami ne 18 sitambar, 2015 ke din da hindu main ek lekh likhaa
 It was titled The way out of the economic tailspin '
 swami ne likhaa ki arthvyavastha ek bade sankat kii ore bad rahi he or 2016 kii shuruyaat tak arthvyavastha krash ho jaaegi
 Three days before this article, Swami wrote a letter to the Prime Minister and targeted Rajan
 swami ne likhaa ki main aapako ye bataane ko vivash hum ki arthvyavastha ladkadaane hi vaali he
 If the right steps are not taken, a major crash between November and February 2016 will not be avoided
 farvari tak arthvyavastha ke krash kar jane kii baat kahi thi
 Half May is gone
 kya hamaari arthvyavastha krash kar gai he
 Why would Swami deliberately raise the sky
 sookshm, laghu or madhyam udyog mantralay kii website par jaakar hamane dekha ki kya rajan kii vajah se chote str ke udyog dhandhe chaupat ho gaye hai
 The 2015-16 annual report of this ministry stated that from April 2015 to September 2015, the growth rate of micro, small and medium industries was 18
 74 fisadi rahi he
 This increase was 17 percent in 2014-15
 2013-14 main 12 pratishat kii dar se vruddhi hui thi
 The comments bharat sarkaar kii website galat aankade de rahi he yaa swami galat bol rahe hai
 In his mind of 30 November 2015, the Prime Minister had said that we have established Mudra Bank, it has started well but the pace is not the way i want
 man kii baat main pradhanmantri ne bataaya tha ki us vakt tak 66 lakh logon ko 42 hazaar karod rupee pradhanmantri mudra yojana ke tahat mil chuke hai
 Is the Prime Minister's mind right or Swami is speaking his mind that due to Rajan's policies, small industries are not able to borrow on interest
 hamaari research ke mutabik jab rajan ne 2013 main kaarykaal sambhala tha tab bainkon ke liye byaaz dar 7
 50 percent, 6 at the moment
 50 pratishat he
 There is a shortfall of about one percent
 rajan ne apane kaarykaal main paanch baar byaaz daron main kami kii he
 Swami does not have any lord but is he dragging the lord of his government also on the pretext of the lord of the lord who is attacking the lord? Does the government also think of Swamy about Rajan? arthvyavastha ko barbaad karne kii saazish kaa aarope behad gambhir he
 In the Rajya Sabha, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said that i know well about Swami's experience and knowledge

 Swamy wrote that the economy is heading towards a major crisis and by early 2016 the economy will crash
 is lekh se teen din pehle bhi swami ne pradhanmantri ko patr likhaa tha or rajan ko nishaanaa banaaya
 Swami wrote that i am forced to tell you that the economy is about to falter
 agar sahi kadam nahin uthaae gaye to november se lekar farvari 2016 ke bich ek bade krash ko taala nahin ja sakegaa
 There was talk of the economy crashing by February
 aadha may chalaa gaya
 Has our economy crashed
 swami kyon jaanboojh kar hauvva khadaa karenge
 By visiting the website of Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Industries, we saw whether due to Rajan, small scale business has been destroyed
 is mantralay kii 2015-16 kii salanaa report main kaha gaya he ki april 2015 se sitambar 2015 tak, sookshm, laghu or madhyam udyogon kii vikaas dar 18
 74%
 2014-15 main yah vruddhi 17 pratishat thi
 There was an increase of 12 percent in 2013-14
 tippaniyan The Indian government website is giving incorrect figures or the owner is misinformed
 30 november 2015 ke apane man kii baat main pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki hamane mudra bank kii sthapana kii he, isaki shuruyaat acchhee rahi he magar raftaar waisi nahin he jaisi main chahta hum
 In the matter of mind, the Prime Minister had said that till that time 66 lakh people have got 42 thousand crores under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana
 pradhanmantri kii man kii baat sahi he yaa swami apane man kii baat kar rahe hai ki rajan kii nitiyon ke kaaran chote udyogon byaaj par karz nahin le paa rahe hai
 According to our research, when Rajan took office in 2013, the interest rate for banks was 7
 50 pratishat thi, is vakt 6
 50 percent
 kareeb ek pratishat kii kami he
 Rajan has reduced interest rates five times during his tenure
 swami kaa koi swami nahin he lekin swami rigerv bank ke jis swami par hamale kar rahe hai uske bahaane kahin ve apni sarkaar ke swami ko bhi to nahin ghaseet rahe? kya rajan ke bare main swami kii soch sarkaar kii bhi he? Swamy has written in his letter that small and medium industries have been harmed by increasing the rate of interest
 ye kadam aisa he jaise kisi biimaar kii hatya kar di jaae taaki uske sharir kaa taapmaana giraaya ja sake
 According to the claims of the government, if the Indian economy is doing well then why has it had to search for a person about its decline, murder and intrigue
 kya swami ke bahaane ek khalanaayak khoja rahaa he jis par arthvyavastha ke chaupat hone kii javabdehi daal di jaae
 Neither the Prime Minister nor the Finance Minister has publicly condemned, or condoned, Swamy's statement
 swami se pehle bijepi saansad murali manohar joshi bhi 2013 main rajan kii naagarikta par sawaal uthaa chuke hai
 According oktober 2013 main waal street jarnal nupur acharya kii report ke anusaar rajan ne mumbai main kaha tha ki main bhartiya naagarik hum or hameshaa bhartiya naagarik rahoonga
 i am proud to be an Indian citizen
 tab rajan ke kaha tha ki unhen koi rose ek mail bhejtaa he or poochta he ki bataaiye ki aap bhartiya hai yaa nahin

 com / ird32wc2oo 21-year-old Saurabh Kumar, who lives in Bakewar town, about 30 km east of Etawah district, has become an inspiration for aged farmers
 do saal pehle intermediat ke baad ghar kii mali haalat kharaab hone ke chalate saurabh ko padhai chhodmai padi
 After a year of farming, he decided to start a milk business with the inspiration of a friend living in Haryana
 jameen bechakar or bank se udhaar lekar unhone videshi nasl kii holistin frigian (echef) gaayon vaali pehali atyaadhunik deyari shuru kii
 Started by machines automatic four months ago, this dairy is producing more than 1,000 liters of milk from 100 HF cows per day
 isi tarah itawa se 300 kimi dur barabanki ke tikait nagar nivasee 35 varshiya jagadish prasad gupta ne bhi doodh vyavsaay ke myne badal die hai
 When the domestic ancestral business of his dairy was dependent on indigenous cows, he took refuge in the ambitious "kamdhenu Yojana" of the state government
 aath maah kii koshish se is saal june main jagadish ne videshi sankar nasl kii sau gaayon ke boote apni deyari ko nai shakl di to utpaadan teen guna bad gaya
 It is not just the success stories of these two farmers in the milk business
 pradesh main takreeban 300 kisaan aise hai, jinhone doodh ke vyavsaay ko nayaa najariya diya he
 Due to being the largest state in the country and the most milch animal population, UP may be the first in milk production, but on the parameters of milk production and per capita milk availability, this state still stands at seventh and eighth position respectively
 dedh saal pehle sarkaar ne jo prayaas shuru kiye, uskaa asar ab dikhne laga he
 In one year, milk production in the state is touching a record of 620 lakh liters per day
 par rajya sahakaari deyari federation pratidin keval 7
 Is able to use 1 lakh liters only
 doodh utpaadan or uske sansthagat vyavsaayik upyog ke bich ke faasale ko paatane ke liye amul, madar deyari, paras, namaste india, gyaan deyari or anik deyari jaisi deyari udyog se judi badi companiyaan upi main kud padi hai
 (A race to overtake Pope Singh Yadav, a resident of Barhan in Agra) In 2012, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav started some important schemes to promote the dairy industry as soon as UP came to power
 unki yah pahal ab aakaar leti dikhaai de rahi he
 Says Akhilesh, "in the next two years, the milk business in Uttar Pradesh will leave behind states like Punjab and Haryana and set a new precedent
 ’’unhone pichley saal janvari main ‘‘kamdhenu deyari’’ yojana kii shuruyaat kii
 In the dairy set up under this scheme, farmers have to make arrangements for 100 buffaloes of cross breed jersey, HF, Sahiwal cows or Murrah species from Punjab and Haryana
 pashudhan vibhaag kisaanon ko gaay-bhainson kii kharid main madad karata he
 1,28,00,000 in opening of dairy Rs
 kaa kharch aata he
 Principal Secretary, Milk Development Anant Kumar Singh says, "the government is making arrangements to get loans from banks to farmers
 khaas baat yah he ki jo kisaan samay par bank ko kist adaa karata he, sarkaar us par lagane vaala byaaj khud adaa karti he
 Thus, a farmer setting up a "kamdhenu Dairy" for about Rs
 32 lakhs
 kii sarkari madad milti he
 Under this scheme, 5 dairies are being set up in every district
 deyari ko kisaanon main or adhik lokapriy banane ke liye loksabhaa chunaav ke baad pradesh main ‘‘mini kamdhenu’’ yojana kii shuruyaat hui
 In this, farmers have to arrange 50 good breed animals instead of 100
 52 lakh ru
 The government is reimbursing 14 lakh rupees of interest in this scheme costing Rs
 vishesh sachiv, dugdh vikaas surendra singh bataate hai, ‘‘mini kamdhenu yojana shuru hone ke kuch hi maheenon main 2,123 kisaanon ne apana panjikaran karaayaa he
 Ramanath, a resident of Bharthana in Amulitawa, produces 50 to 60 liters of milk daily
 chah maah pehle tak ve gaanv main hi oune-paune daam par doodh bech dete the
 But 2 of "national Dairy Development Board" on the road from Etawah to Saifai
 5 lakh litre kshamta vaali yojana ‘‘madar deyari’’ ke may se shuru hote hi aasapaas ke jilon ke unke jaise takreeban ek lakh chote kisaanon ko doodh bechney ke sankat se chhutkaaraa mil gaya he
 Asia's largest dairy brand "priceless" has jumped in the race to capture the increased milk production in UP
 lakhanu main sultanpur road par chak ganjariya shahar main 210 karod ru
 The work of Amul's dairy plant with a capacity of five lakh liters is being started at a cost of Rs
 mukhya sachiv karyaalay ke ek adhikari kehete hai, ‘‘amul deyari se lakhanu ke aasapaas ke 16 jilon kii kul 4,862 doodh samitiyon se jude kisaan labhanvit honge
 '' Amul UP has Rs 1,000 crore
 se adhik kaa nivesh karegaa
 (yadav dairy open under Kamadhenu scheme) Challenged by increasing competition, the State Cooperative Dairy Federation is facing a tough challenge due to the entry of other entities in the milk market
 isse nibatane ke liye sarkaar 100 karod ru

 Names of BJP leaders as well as Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leaders have started coming in the grip of the prevalence of Madhya Pradesh's Vyapam scam
 pichley ek saal se yah ghotaalaa jaanch ke str par hi he or aae din kisi na kisi nae mode par pahunch jaataa he
 Vyapam Medical Board of Professional Examinations conducts recruitment in many types of government jobs ranging from engineering
 iske madhyam se kareeb dedh lakh bhartiyon hui hai
 How legitimate they are and how illegitimate they will be known by investigation, but all have become suspects
 police kii pipe dwaara jal chhidkaav kaa yah drishy bhopal sthit madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ke ghar ke baahar kaa he
 When Congress party leaders reached siege over the activist Vyapam scam
 shuukravaar kii subah kai news channelon par yah khabar chali ki vyapam ghotaale ke mukhya aropiyon main se ek pankaj trivedi ne bayaan diya he ki unhone 2012 main food inspector kii naukari main mihir naam ke vyakti ko paas karaane main madad kii he
 Copies of the alleged statement also started circulating on the channels, stating that Mihir was recommended by the arrested former minister Laxmikant Sharma, as he was close to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh elder Suresh Soni
 mihir aresas ke purv pramukh divangat kasee sudasharn kaa sahaayak bhi tha
 Mihir is currently out on bail after being arrested in this case
 estf ke sutron ne hamaare sahyogi ko bataaya he ki divangat netaa sudarshan yaa soni kii bhoomika is ghotaale main sunishchit nahin kii ja sakati he, isliye abhi tak estf ne inhen aaropee nahin banaaya he
 Pankaj Trivedi was the director and exam controller of Vyapam who is now in jail
 aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ne kaha he ki kanoon apana kaam karegaa hamen chintaa nahin he
 The scandal comes to light from a raid by the Indore police on July 6, 2013
 agast 2013 main ise estf ko saunp diya jaataa he
 Due to the slow progress in the case from August to May, the High Court takes over its supervision in May this year and also criticizes the STF
 farji tareeke se na jane kitne munna bhai doctor ban gaye
 Not only this, the rules of other recruitment examinations were also changed to benefit the bribe students
 saal 2012 tak kai bhartiyon sambandhit vibhaagon se hi hoti thim, magar unase lekar vyapam ko de di gayi
 33 percent of physical tests were compulsory in the recruitment of sub inspect
 kathith rup se ghoose dene vaale parikshaarthiyon ko laabh pahunchane ke liye ise 2012 main 20 pratishat kiya gaya or phir 2013 main physical test ko puri tarah se samaapt kar diya gaya
 When sub-inspectors of bribe students were not in the inspector, the vacancy of the transport constable was removed for allegedly giving them another chance
 is artio consteble kii bhartee ke liye bhi physical test anivaary hua karata tha
 In 2012 this rule was abolished
 janvari 2012 tak parivahan aarakshak kii bhartee police hi karti thi
 But in July 2012, the job of recruiting 8000 posts was handed over to Vyapam
 madhya pradesh ke akhabaaron main yah bhi chapa he ki parivahan aarakshak kii bhartee ke kuch niyam aise banaae gaye the, jisase sirf madhya pradesh ke logon ko hi naukari mili
 But when it was found that the candidates of other states give more bribe, then the two rules required for this job were also changed
 assi ke dashak main arjuna singh ke banaae niyam kii naukari se pehle rajya ke rojgaar karyaalay main panjikaran jaruri he or 98 main digvijay singh ne niyam banaaya tha ki dasvin or barahavin paas madhya pradesh se hi hona chahie
 The rule for registration in the first employment office was changed in July 2012, then in January 2013, the tenth twelfth pass rule was abolished
 tab saadhe saat hazaar bhartiyon huin thi
 Another aspect of the Vyapam scam is the Right to Information Act
 pehali baar iskaa istamaal ghoose dene or system kii aankh main dhul jhonkne main hua he
 Students who bribed were asked to leave their answer sheets blank
 in chaatro ko computer main chhedchhad kar number dekar paas kar diya gaya
 But his copy was zero
 tab ek idia ye nikaala gaya ki ye sabhi artiai ke tahat apni uttar pustika maange
 Which is called optic marking sheet
 rigelt aane ke baad uttar pustaka par gole banaae gaye or copy jamaa ho gai
 There have been acts of this level
 pankaj trivedi vyapam ke nideshak the to unheen chaatro kii artiai manjuur hui, jinhone ghoose die the yaa phir ve sab vyapam main paas ho gaye, jinhone artiai lagaai thi
 The investigation is going on and the verdict has not come, so wherever the alleged apprehension has been missed, then the use of the alleged should be taken

 After suffering a crushing defeat at the hands of the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections, RJD chief Lalu Prasad has started a fresh strategy to regain his lost public support

 When politics was changed rapidly after the implementation of the Mandal Commission report, politics changed rapidly in Bihar in the 90s after implementing the Mandal Commission report recommending reservation for obcs in government jobs

 It was really difficult to play r Ashwin on the first day of the gaol test against Sri Lanka

 The Sri Lankan batsmen found it so difficult to play Ashwin that he took 6 wickets for just 46 runs

 "comments yahi vajah he ki chaahe wo fatullah kaa maidan ho yaa phir galle kaa, aswin kii gendon main spin najar aa rahaa he, ve control ke saath flite bhi kara rahe hai
 The impact of these two aspects is clearly visible on his bowling
 haalanki thode samay pehle ve kairam ball or driftor jaisi duusari vairayeti kaa zyaada istemaal kar rahe the
 Not only this, he had also experimented with his bowling action and bowling run up many times
 lekin in tamaam prayogon ne unhen ek ausat darje kaa gendbaaz bana diya tha
 His place in the team began to be questioned, but at the right time he realized his mistake and the result is in front of everyone

 He (shatrughan Sinha) made three tweets in a sequential manner, advising PM Modi
 unhone apane pehle twit main kaha ki mananeey outgowing saraji (PM Modi) , apane bhaashanon ke baad apni vaahvahee karaane ke liye vibhinn chelan or pryojit janata ke peeche paise kharch karnaa band kiijie
 There has always been a lack of facts in your speech
 vahiin ek anya twit main shatrughna (shatrughan Sinha) ne kaha ki in dinon to aap logon ko had se zyada chidchida bana de rahe hai
 i am friendly to you despite the EVM disturbances and your arrogance
 ab is ain maukey par main aapako ek suzav dena chaahunga ki aap sidhe ho jaaen or sidhe hi chalem
 Honble outgoing Sirji
 Why are you wasting so much money on different channels and on the paid and choreographed crowd who chant your name at any given time - during, before & after your speeches on the signal of the conductors
 Your rhetorics / speeches lack content and depththese days and have gone to the extent of becoming highly repetitive and irritating
 Sirji, i still remain your well wisher despite your EVM misuse and in-spite of all your arrogance
 My humble suggestion for you at this eleventh hour would be to become straight and go straight
 shatrughna sinha ne piem ko salaah dete hue kaha ki aap pej news channel par naa jaaen
 You should go to the actual press conference
 jahaan raveesh kumaar or prasoon vaajapeyi jesai patrkaar hote hai
 Those who cannot be bought will ask you the right questions related to the interest of the nation
 aise press ke paas janaa chahie jo chamache naa ho or jinhen chup nahin karaayaa ja saktaa
 Don't hire or go for paid channels
 Instead go for a real and genuine Press Conference with people like Raveesh Kumar, Prasun Vajpayee etc
 who can't be bought can question you in the larger interest of the nation
 Go for the Press who are not sycophants & can't be silencedbawa den ki patna sahib se bhaajapa saansad sinha ko sidline kiye jane ke baad se vah party or uske netritv par kai saalon se nishaanaa sadhate rahe hai
 The party has not yet taken any disciplinary action against him
 vahiin party ne is baar unki seat se kendriya mantri ravi shankar prasad ko tikat diya he
 Sinha also tweeted that this is a surprising move at this point of political career
 haalanki, yah van main sho or tu main army ke taanaashaahee shashan main hi isaki ummid kii ja sakati he
 This step is humiliating and shameful
 'saath hi unhone likhaa tha ki laal krishna adwani or anya varisht netaa murali manohar joshi or shanta kumaar kaa apmaan hua he
 This has hurt the entire country
 log is faisle se bhounchakke hai
 Once again, i hope and pray that people do not respond appropriately to the injustice done to the senior leaders of our party

 The activism of these women, who have become synonymous with terror for alcoholics, is that 90 to 95 percent of the people in the village have given up drinking
