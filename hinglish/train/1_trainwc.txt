 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government will present the first budget of its second innings on 5 July
 is baar kendriya vittamantri nirmala sitaraman bajet pesh karengi
 In absolute terms she is the first woman Finance Minister of the country
 piem modi ne duusari baar satta main aate hi alpsankhyakon kaa vikaas ke jariye vishwaas jeetne kii baat kahi he
 This has raised new hope among the minorities of the country and Modi government 2
 0 ke pehle bajet ko badi ummid bhari najaron se dekh rahe hai
 Modern schools to be opened in minority blocks: Farooqadilli Kamal Farooqui, former chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission and a member of the Muslim Personal Law Board, says, "we hope that the Modi government will take steps towards strengthening the minority community through the budget
" kai reports ke jariye yah baat sabit ho chuki he ki muslim samudaay shiksha ke kshetra main kaaphi peeche he
 In such a situation, the Modi government should take steps towards the education of Muslims
 'faruki kehete hai ki desh main jo alpsankhyak block hai vahaan par modern skool khole jaaen
 Apart from this, Waqf property should be developed through Minority Development Finance Corporation and educational institutions should be built on those Waqf properties
 vah kehete hai ki alpsankhyakon main lagaataar berogari bad rahi he aise main sarkaar ko job oriented corcej kii vyavastha kerani chahie
 The way Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken about the development of minorities as soon as he comes to power, it is to be seen now whether the budget has a glimpse of it
 laghu udyog ke liye 50 lakh kii limit ho: hamidaul india muslim majalis-e-mushaavrat ke adhyaksh naved hamid kehete hai ki modi sarkaar ne 5 saal main 5 karod muslim vidhyaarthiyon ko chaatravrutti dene kaa elaan kiya he
 In such a situation, we have to see how much budget is allocated for the scholarship
 isse pataa chalegaa ki modi sarkaar kaa elaan kitna sahi he
 Apart from this, the government has talked about making minorities self-reliant
 iske liye minurity deveopment finance korporation ke aavantit bajet dekhnaa hoga
 Minority Development Finance Corporation's loan procedure to minorities should be simplified and a limit of 50 lakhs for small scale industries
 hamid kehete hai ki modi sarkaar ne madrason ke aadhunikeekaran kii baat kahi he
 In such a case, CBSC syllabus should be taught in madrasas, so its rules and laws should also be applicable
 aise main bajet se bataa chalegaa ki sarkaar madrason kaa kis tarah se aadhunik bananaa chaahati he
 Muslims get priority in business sector: Chairperson of Jamilayenpoia University in Islamic Studies and Head of Research Department Dr
 javed jameel kehete hai ki maujuuda sarkaar ke do bade agenda hai, jinamein ek corporate or doosraa communal agenda he
 In such a situation, the budget of the government is likely to be based on the interest of the corporate
 musalamaanon ke taalluk se sarkaar bahut zyada kuch karne vaali nahin he
 Although she is talking about the modernization of madrasas, the way the government wants to do this should be made clear
 modi sarkaar madrason kaa dhanchaagat modernigeshan karti he to kisi koi apatti nahin he, lekin idology str par modernigeshan karnaa chaahati to musalamaanon ko sweekaar nahin hoga
 The Central Government has a Welfare Ministry, through which funding to Enzo
 aise welfare mantralay ke jariye 15 fisadi fund enjio ko muslim samudaay ke liye kaam ko die jaaen
 Muslim communities are economically backward
 desh main ek hajaar registerd companiya hai
 Only 10 to 11 companies belong to Muslims in it
 jabaki yah aankada 150 ke kareeb he
 It can be clearly understood that the condition of Muslims is not much better in the business sector also
 iske liye sarkaar ko sochna chahie
 In order to make the minority community self-reliant, small scale industry should be promoted
 iske saath hi aarthik saamanta ke liye sarkaar ko kadam uthaane chahie

 gujarat cader ke ipies adhikarirajnish raine mangalvaar ko apana istipha sarkaar ko saunp diya
 1992 Rajneesh Rai, an IPS officer of Gujarat cadre, is currently working in CRPF in Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh
 ipies adhikari ke taur par istipha dene vaale rajnish raay duusare gujarat cader ke ipies adhikari he
 Earlier in Gujarat, Rahul Sharma also submitted his resignation
 rajnish raay bataur ipies adhikari vivaadon main rahe hai
 He first came into controversy when the Modi government was in Gujarat, and in the Sohrabuddin Kefarji encounter case, the second Gujarat-based IPS officer DG Vanzara and other policemen were arrested on the duty
 gujaratmen rajnish raay, rahul sharma or satish verma ye teen aise ipies adhikari hai jinhone 2001 main modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad sarkaar ke kaam kaa khulkar virodh kiya tha
 Rahul Sharma came into controversy when he gave the mobile location and the cds of the phones of all the leaders to the commission investigating the Godhra riots
 rajnish raay ne soharabuddin encounter konerjibatate hue kausarabi kii hatya kiye jane kaa aarope modi sarkaar ke behad kareeb rahe aise ipies adhikari diji vanjaaraa or unki team par lagaaya tha, to vahiin satish verma ne ishrat encounter ko farji bataaya tha
 After the Modi government came to the center in 2014, Rajneesh Rai was transferred to CRPF in Andhra Pradesh
 modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad rajnish pichley saal us samay charchaa main aae jab unhone siarpief ke sheersh adhikariyon ko apni ek report di jisamen bataaya tha ki kaise sena, ardhsainik bal or asampulicene 29-30 march chirang jile ke simalgudi ilaake main farji muthbhed ko anjaam diya or do vyaktiyon ko endiefabi (es) kaa sadsy bataakar maar daalaa tha
 After this, the Supreme Court had summoned the Central Government, Defense Ministry, Government of Assam and CRPF
 jiske baad bina kisi vajah is saal june main rajnish raay kaa transfar andhra pradesh kar diya gaya
 Former Supreme Court judge Justice GS Singhvi, who ordered the cancellation of spectrum licenses given to 122 companies in the 2G scam, has made it clear that the judgment from the special court is not appropriate to be combined with the decision of the Supreme Court
 ajtak se baatcheet main justise singhvi ne saaf kaha ki unke paas sirf spactrum aavanton kii prakriya ko lekar maamla aayaa tha jisamen pesh kiye gaye saboot or jirah par adaalat ne faisla sunaaya tha
 But the trial before the CBI special court was completely different
 ye aapraadhik gaban sajeesh or sarkari pad or rutabe ke durupyog kaa maamla he
 Justice Singhvi said that when the matter came in front of us, it was clear that the manner in which the spectrum licenses were distributed to the companies was flawed
 biding process kii bajaay pehle aao pehle paao kii niti par amal main bhi kai gadabadiyaan saamne ain
 After the license was canceled, the government again auctioned them, then more than 64 thousand crore rupees came to the government treasury
 justise singhvi ne ye bhi kaha ki kisi bhi adaalat ke saamne jo saboot pesh kiye jate hai unase hi adaalat faisle par pahunchati he
 The courts never produce evidence themselves
 ye kaam to jaanch agenciyon kaa he
 How the evidence is presented in order and arguments according to them, only then the courts understand the whole matter, and at the same time we should also note that the acquittal of the accused or the acquittal in the absence of evidence are both completely different things
 
 unako isi hisaab se samajhnaa chahie
 Justice Singhvi's statement should also be seen in the light that as soon as the verdict came, BJP leaders compared the Supreme Court's decision with the special CBI court
 pehle aao pehle paao kii niti main bhi oune-paune daam main apane apane logon ko spactrum die gaye
 Many companies, which had nothing to do with tele-communication, also got spectrum allotted
 karodon rupee ajibo-garib dhang se idhar se udhar transfar hue
 That is, the government policy as well as its implementation showed flaws on foot
 unheen ko dekhte hue supreme court ne un companiyon ko die gaye license radd karne ke aadesh die the
 Now the special court has given the verdict in view of the criminal case in its entirety
 to aise main donon mukademon or donon faislon ko ek hi palade par rakhkar taulnaa yaa dekhnaa katai uchit nahin he
 Also, being acquitted in the absence of evidence does not mean that the accused did not commit the crime
 agar ham kuch puraane maamalon ko bhi dekhen jinamein ahm hai jesica laal hatyakand yaa priyadarshini mattu hatyakand, donon charchit aurasamvedansheel hatyakandamen nichali adaalat ne aropiyon ko bari kiya tha lekin upree adaalat main wo salaakhon ke peeche bheje gaye
 It will now be seen whether CBI and ED officials will take seriously the questions raised by the decision of the special court
 
 
 kyonki court ne saaf shabdon main kai sawaal baari bharkam jaanch agenciyon ke adhikariyon kii liyakat, samaj or sooyeeboojh par uthaae gaye hai
 It has been a hundred years since World War I
 is ladaai main bhartiya sainikon ke saahas or bahaduree ko yaad karte hue bhartiya sena ne dilli ke monekashow centre main ek prardashni lagaai he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi also reached to see the exhibition today
 is pradarshnee ko dekh pradhanmantri modi kaaphi khush hue or is pradsharni ko das dinon tak badhaane kaa nirdesh diya he, taaki zyada se zyada aam log is pradarshnee ko dekh saken
 The exhibition seeks to recreate conditions such as the First World War
 baat chaahe veshbhusha kii ho yaa hathiyaar kii
 About 74 thousand Indian soldiers were martyred in this battle, while more than 60 thousand were injured
 is vishwa yuddh main jitne bhartiya sainik maare gaye the, utane sainik azaadi ke baad hue yuddh main bhi shahid nahin hue hai
 a hundred years ago Indian soldiers fought extraordinary battles
 us vakt ye sainik bitrain kii ore se ladane ke liye france, purvi africa se lekar iraq tak gaye
 The bravery and courage of these soldiers was remembered by the Indian Army
 vah jawan to nahin rahe, lekin unki yaadon ko jarur tarotaaja kiya gaya
 Earlier, the Supreme Commander and President Pranab Mukherjee of all the three armies had come and today Prime Minister Narendra Modi came
 itihaas main in javaanon ke yogadan ko lagbhag bhuulaa diya gaya he, lekin sau saal baad hi sahi un bhartiya javaanon ko yaad karne kii yah ek acchhee koshish he, jinhone apane veerta ke paracham duniya main laharaae
 Probably many people will not know that the Idea Gate was built by Britain in memory of Indian soldiers who died in the First World War

 shukla ke kilaaf iske do din baad hi yani 2 april ko
 But according to sources, Dr
 Shukla was not arrested because of the upper reaches
 teen siemo kaa hashr jamaane ke saamne he
 Now the fourth CMO, Dr
 Shukla, is under police custody
 kya hoga aage?kya shukla kholenge raaj yaa phir khud nishane par hai dow
 Shukla? This is the biggest suspense of this three thousand crore serial killing
 doctor shukla kii giraftaar ne ek baar phir doctor sachaan kii kahani taaja kar di he
 The fear is that Dr
 Shukla's speech should not be stopped even before the truth is revealed, and in view of this apprehension, the High Court ordered not only to keep Dr
 Shukla under strict surveillance in jail but also in front of the camera round the clock
 Is narrated kya aapane kabhi suna he ki jail ke andar koi kaidi choubison ghante camere kii bhi kaid main rahe? aap bhale hi yakeen naa karen par aisa hone ja rahaa he
 Former CMO doctor AK Shukla, arrested in connection with the scam of three thousand crores and serial killing, will be in front of the camera for 24 hours as long as he is in jail
 dow
 The court itself is shocked by the killing of Sachan, the commander of Shukla under camera surveillance, inside the jail
 or yahi vajah he ki mangalvaar ko jab elahabaad hai court kii lakhanu bench ne doctor shukla ko 14 dinon kii nyaayik hiraat main jail bhejne kaa faisla sunaaya to saath main ye bhi hukum diya ki doctor shukla ko chaumbison ghante jail ke dar sisitivi camere kii nigaraanee main rakhaa jaae
 The High Court has also given strict instructions to the jail administration to keep Dr
 Shukla under strict security
 darasal ek ke baad ek teen siemo ke katl kii vajah se doctor shukla kii suraksha ko lekar adaalat koi kotahi nahin chaahati he
 Seeing the fate of the three previous cmos, the family of Dr
 Shukla himself was apprehensive about his safety
 darasal jab se teen hajaar kaa ye ghotaalaa saaman aayaa he tabhi se ye kaha ja rahaa he ki iske peeche bade or taqatvar logon kaa haath he
 Even Anand Tiwari, a shooter arrested in the charge of the same serial killing, has demanded protection, terming his life as a threat
 shooter anand tiwari ne kaha ki hamen apni jaan kaa khatra he kyonki is cond ke peeche kai bade log hai
 It is not just Anand Tiwari who is scared
 is serial kiling kaa ek or mohara abhaya singh jo is vakt jail main kaid he, wo bhi buree tarah sahamaa hua he ki kahin saboot mitaate-mitaate khud use bhi naa mitaa diya jaae
 Every small pawn and officer associated with this scandal and serial killing is in danger of his life, and why should there be a danger
 jo log jail ke andar ghus kar doctor sachaan kii jubaan band kar sakate hai unki pahunch kaa andaja aasaani se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 By the way, let me also tell you that it has been proved in the judicial inquiry that Dr
 Sachan did not commit suicide but he was murdered inside the jail
 dow
 Sachan was murdered inside the jail, the biggest suspense of the three thousand crore scam is that two cmos are shot in public
 or jis tisare siemo ko donon katl ke iljaam main giraftaar kiya jaataa he khud uskaa jail ke andar katl kar diya jaataa he
 The plot is then followed by the murder
 laash ko pankhe se latakaaya jaataa he
 So that the world feels suicidal
 lekin, cheef jayudiciel magistrate ne apni report main aakhirkaar is sajeesh ko benakaab kar diya he
 The magistrate in his report submitted to Manglawar in the High Court has said that Dr
 sachaan ko ek sajeesh ke tahat jail ke andar maaraa gaya
 Dr
 sachaan ugalane ja rahe the saazish rachane waalon ke namasutron ke mutabik apni maut se ek din pehle dow
 Sachan had told some inmates in the jail that he was being made a sacrificial goat in this serial killing
 dow
 Sachan had said that he will tell the police the names of all those people who are directly involved in this scam and who have a hand in this conspiracy
 darasal 17 june ko upi police ne teen shootaron ko pakad kar ek press conference main khulaasa kiya ki dow
 Sachan executed the CMO massacre by giving a betel nut of seven lakhs
 ye khabar jaise hi jail main pahanchi dow
 The scare erupted
 23 june ko dow
 Sachan was to be questioned on police remand
 sutron ke mutabik dow
 Sachan had also told his family members that they would tell the police the names of the people involved in the conspiracy
 lekin police remand par jane se ek din pehle yani 22 june ko hi dow
 Sachan died in mysterious condition
 ek aisi maut jise police or sarkaar lagaataar khudakushi bataa rahi thi
 But the police and the government dismantled Dr
 sachaan kii postortem report ne
 The police kept on repeating that Dr
 sachaan ne gale main belt kaa fanda kas kar khudakshi kii or phir apni nasen kaat leen
 Whereas according to the post mortem report, Drs
 sachaan ke gale main fanda unki maut ke baad ksaa gaya
 The report states or that Dr
 sachaan ke sharir main jakhm ke kul nau nishaan the
 Eight of them were before death
 jabaki navaan jakhm yani gale par fande kaa nishaan maut ke baad kaa tha
 And just this report proved in judicial inquiry that Ductor Sachan had not committed suicide but was murdered
 lakhanu kii sadakon par ek-ek kar do siemo ko unheen ke ghar ke baahar goliyon se bhun diya jaataa he
 The investigation takes place and then the police put the charges of both these murders on the doctor's plot and arrest them
 lekin iske baad khud doctor sachaan kaa jail ke andar katl ho jaataa he
 Three sensational deaths one after the other began this bloody affair no years ago
 balki maamla mahaj 8 maheene pehle kaa he
 The bloody game started on 27 October 2010 when CMO VK Arya, who accounted for thousands of crores, was gunned down in the morning outside his house in Lucknow
 saboot ke taur par police ko mauka-e-vaadaat se sirf goliyon ke khokhe mili
 After Arya's murder, Deputy CMO Sachan was made the executive seamo
 lekin phir sarkaar ne bees janvari ko seva chayan ke aadhaar par beepi singh ko nayaa siemo bana diya
 As soon as BP Singh took office, he started investigating the scams
 lekin jaanch abhi aage badhati ki tabhi unka bhi thik vahi hashr hua jo puv siemo arya kaa hua tha
 On April 2 this year, just like Dr
 Arya, Dr
 BP Singh was riddled with bullets outside his house in the morning when he went for a walk
 mauka-e-vaardaat se is baar bhi police ko bas chale hue kaartoos ke khaali khokhe hi mili
 Like they met earlier in the murder
 do-do siemo kaa katl ho chukaa tha
 The matter was serious
 lihaaja jaanch estf ko saunp di gai
 Investigations found that both murderers used the same weapon
 ye nateeja belastic report main ke par mili khaali khokhe ke aadhaar par kiya gaya
 That is, whatever the motive, the murderer was one
 lekin raaj isliye gaharaa gaya kyonki hathiyaar ek hone ke baavjood police ne kaatil alag-alag pakade
 In the murder of Dr
 Arya, Mafia kingpin Abhay Singh of Purvanchal was made the main accused
 balki doctor beepi singh ke katl kaa thikra doctor sachaan ke sir phod diya gaya
 This investigation of the police started raising questions and fingers started to be raised on the credibility of the government
 vipaksh ab khul kar bol rahaa tha ki is serial kiling main sarkaar apane do bade diggaj netaaon ko bachaane ke liye lipapoti kar rahi he
 On the other hand, the police remained adamant that Dr
 Sachan had scammed government money
 unhen dar tha ki jaanch hui to wo pakade jaaenge
 To avoid this, he first killed Dr
 Vinod Arya and then Dr
 beepi singh kii
 But when Dr
 Sachan died in jail, it was said in the tongue of speech that the mastermind of serial killing is someone else
 asli khel auki asli sajeesh koi or rach rahaa he, or wo itnaa taqatvar he ki us tak police bhi pahunchane se kataraa rahi he
 But who is that? Can two-three cmos carry out such a big scandal alone? Can such a big game be played only between officers? Obviously, this thing is not worth digging from anywhere
 sajeesh ke taar kahin upar tak hai
 But to what extent? Everyone has been speaking
 lekin kah koi nahin rahaa
 Raaz, Dr
 sachaan jaanate the
 But he was not allowed to speak
 bas yahi sach he is teen hajaar karod kii serial kiling kaa
 Actually, according to the sources, behind this serial killing, there is only and only money
 donon siemo kii hatya or phir doctor sachaan kii maut kaa taar netaa, afasar or apradhi ke gathjod se judaa hua he
 Funds worth more than three thousand crores came from the Center in the Family Welfare Department of Darussal UP
 enecharem ke isi fund main paison kii khuli lut or bandarbaant hone lagi
 If sources are to be believed, bureaucrats and leaders were at the forefront of the monkey money
 ye katl jab surkhiyaan baniin to janata ke dabaav main tatkaaleen swasthya mantri anant mishra kaa istipha dena padaa
 After this, Family Welfare Minister Babulal Kushwaha also had to go
 par sawaal uthta he ki agar enecharem fund ke sabase upar kushvaha baithe the to phir police ne kushvaha se poochtacha kyon nahin kii? isi tarah tatkaaleen swasthya mantri anant mishra ko bhi jaanch ke daayre se kyon baahar rakhaa gaya?aakhir main sawaal sirf ek line kaa he ki kya teen hajaar karod jaisi baari-bharkam rakam siemo jaise pad par baithe do-teen afasar akele dakaar sakate hai? sawaal ye bhi ki phir do-do mantriyon kaa istipha kyon liya gaya? or sawaal ye bhi ki kya koi in mantriyon ke upar bhi he
 Which is stronger than them? Obviously, everyone has been speaking, but no one is saying
 har koi kah rahaa he ki tamaam siemo kii maut ek sajeesh he or sajeesh rachane vaale taqatvar log
 But who are these people? Who has access inside the jail? Obviously it is important for you to understand every aspect of this whole matter
 upi kii raajnneeti ke do bade chehre hai babulal kushvaha jinke bare main kaha jaataa he ki jitne wo kareeb hai mayawati ke utana koi or nahin
 When funds of three thousand crores started coming in the Health Ministry, Kushwaha Saheb was made the Minister for Family Welfare
 doosraa cheharaa he anant kumaar mishra kaa
 He is a former health minister of UP, who is special to Satish Chandra Mishra, who is called Number Two of UP
 upi ke ye do ahm chehre hamane aapako isliye dikhaae kyonki jab ek ke baad ek is serial kiling kaa doosraa katl hua (doosraa murder beepi singh kaa dikhaaen) to janata ke dabaav main mayawati sarkaar ko kushvaha or anant mishra kaa istipha lenaa padaa
 But the resignation also did not work
 kyonki teen hajaar karod koi maamuli rakam nahin hoti
 The third death occurred before the UP government's police cracked the case
 ek aisi maut jisane sarkaar ko ulajhaa kar rakh diya

 Earlier this month, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made a commitment to take stern action against virtual currencies such as the Bitcoins
 jetali ne apane bajet bhaashan main kaha tha, ‘sarkaar kryptokarency ko legal tender yaa coin nahin maanati or aise saare kadam uthaae jaaenge jisase inkaa istemaal avaidh gatividhiyon ko finance karne main naa kiya ja sake, saath hi pement system ke hisse ke taur par bhi iskaa istemaal nahin kiya ja sake

 When India Today tried to get to the bottom of this 'glitter' of this production house, something else came to the fore

 vishaal ne kaha, ‘kryptokarency ke liye bahut craij he
 You need finance for various projects

 dilli kaa ames
 Suddenly there was a strange movement in the air of Delhi
 netaaon ne desh ke sabase bade aspataal kaa rukh karnaa shuru kar diya or khabar ai ki purv videsh mantri or bijepi kii kaddavar netaa sushamaa swaraj kaa heart atake ke kaaran nidhan ho gaya
 This news spread like a forest fire and on seeing it there was a spurt of mourning messages on social media
 log apane-apane tareeke se sushamaa swaraj ko yaad karne lage
 While the leaders of BJP and opposition parties were telling about his personality, the common people were seen praising his serious personality and achievements
 sushamaa swaraj kaa antim sanskaar buudhvaar ko 3 baje kiya jayega
 Karra Sandeshuma Swaraj was the country's first fulltime female foreign minister
 haalanki indira gandhi ne bhi do baar videsh mantralay kaa kaarybhaar sambhala lekin pradhanmantri rahete hue
 Indira Gandhi from 6 September 1967 to 14 November 1966 and thereafter from 19 July 1984 to 31 October 1984
 lekin is dauraan vah pradhanmantri bhi raheen
 Sushma Swaraj made unprecedented changes as soon as Modi took charge in the first term of the Modi government
 twitor or anya soshal media plateforms par logon kii madad karne se lekar videshon main fanse logon kii pareshaaniyon ko dur karne ke liye unki jamkar tarif kii gai
 When he gave a speech at the United Nations, Pakistan Bungalow was seen peeping
 vahiin doklam mudde par bhi unhone china ko sansad se karaara sandesh diya tha
 Former Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj passed away, pay tribute here, there was no mourner Sushma Swaraj, born in Ambala, Haryana on 14 February 1952, got the knowledge of RSS from home
 unke pita aresas ke bade netaa the
 Bachelor's degree in Political Science and Sanskrit from Sanatan Dharma College, Ambala Cantt
 iske baad chandigarh kii punjab uniwarsity se kanoon kii padhai kii
 He had no harm in speaking
 iske lekar lagaataar teen saal unhen hindi kii sarvshereshth vaktaa kaa aword bhi mila
 After this, he entered politics through ABVP in 1970
 1973 main supreme court main bataur vakil practice shuru kii
 In college, he met Swaraj Kaushal, after which the love of the two grew
 iske baad donon ne june 1975 main immergency lagane ke kuch hi din baad shaadi kar lee
 The first youngest cabinet minister, Rahenjulai, was made cabinet minister in 1977 under Chief Minister Devi Lal's government
 vah pehali sabase yuva cabinet mantri raheen
 She was also the Education Minister of Haryana from 1987 to 1990
 saal 1990 main unhone rashtriya raajnneeti main entry kii
 In 1996, she was elected as an MP from South Delhi
 lekin 1998 main vah dilli kii mukhyamantri baniin lekin baad main bijepi chunaav haar gayi or sushamaa ne waapas rashtriya raajnneeti main entry kii
 Foreign politicians also mourned the death of Sushma Swaraj
 unka antim sanskaar mangalvaar ko dopaher 3 baje lodhi road par kiya jayega
 The new chairman of the censor board, Pahlaj Nihalani, is thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Information and Broadcasting Minister Arun Jaitley, who made him the new chairman
 unhone kaha, "main khush hum, or shukraguzaar hum modi ji or arun jetali ji kaa
 
 
 i did not get this chair because of making a video of Modi ji
 
 
 unka video banane kii meri khwaahish thi, jo hamane kii
 
 
 But i got this chair because of my social work, because of working for the film industry for years
 
 
 " Actually, Arun Jaitley had said that he would keep the censor board away from politics, but now most of the new members of the board are connected with BJP
 is mudde par pehlaaj nihlani ne kaha, "isamen bura kya he, agar main kisi party ko samarthan detaa hum
 
 
 i support the BJP
 
 
 modi ji kaa samarthak hum, kyonki vah meri nazar main ection hero hai
 
 
 The same thing has happened during the Congress time
 
 
 ab agar bijepi ke samay main unhone apane jaanane waalon ko zimmedaari di he, to isamen kya galat he
 
 
 " pehlaaj nihlani kareeb 45 saal se film industry kaa hissaa hai or jane-maane nirmaataa rahe hai
 There is no doubt that he has done a lot of work for the good of the film industry
 pehlaaj nihlani kehete hai, "sensor board main paise kamaane ke liye nahin ja rahaa hum
 
 
 i have been given a responsibility, will play it with complete honesty, because i am a part of this industry and understand the problems here
 
 
 pehle bhi jab koi industry se judaa aadmi sensor board kaa chairman bana he, kabhi koi vivaad nahin hua
 
 
 Dozens of film personalities like Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Shakti Samanta, Asha Parekh became the chairman, but they took decisions keeping the film industry in mind and because of this the censor board was not in controversy
 pichhali chairman lila samson film industry se nahin thim, unhen bollywood kii jaankaree nahin thi, isliye unhone thik se samay bhi nahin diya, or sahi nirnay bhi nahin liye, isiilie aise vivaad hue
 
 
 " gairi balance or ian bel kii badi shatkeey pariyon se pehali pari main vishaal score khadaa karne vaale england ne duusare din shuru main hi bharat ko jhatka dekar southamton main chal rahe tisare test cricket match main apni sthiti majboot kar lee
 Bell scored 167 by presenting a superb sample of concentration, aggression and skill
 is 32 varshiya ballebaaj ne is bich pehle din shatak jadne vaale balance (156) ke saath tisare wicket ke liye 142 or wicketiper ballebaaj jose butler (85) ke saath chathe wicket ke liye 106 ran kii saajhedaari kii
 Butler missed out on a century in his first Test match and soon after his dismissal, Alastair Cook declared the innings at 569 for seven
 bharat ne iske jawaab main duusare din kaa khel samaapt hone tak ek wicket par 25 ran banaaye hai or vah ab bhi england se 544 ran peeche he
 Opener Murali Vijay was playing 11 and Cheteshwar Pujara scoring four runs at stumps
 shikhar dhawan (6) phir se naakaam rahe
 James Anderson's outward swinging ball took the outside edge of his bat and went safely to Cook in the slip
 dhawan is shrinkhalaa main abhi tak paanch pariyon main keval 85 ran bana paye hai
 Earlier, Bell, who completed a century by hitting a six over Ravindra Jadeja, also completed 7000 Test runs during his innings
 unhone pari ke 159wein over main bhubaneshwar kumaar kii gend par mid aaf par khadey pankaj singh ko kaich thamaya
 Bell played 256 balls in his innings and hit 19 fours and three sixes
 bhartiya gendbaaj pehle do test maichon kii tarah anushaasit gendbaaji nahin kar paae or england ke ballebaajon ko ran banane main koi dikkat nahin hui
 England started the game at 247 for two in the morning
 unhone pehle satr main 29 over main 111 ran jode or is bich balance kaa wicket ganvaaya jo ki durbhagyapurna dhang se pavilion laute
 The 288-ball innings of the balance included 24 fours
 mahendra singh dhoni ne duusare satr main gendbaaji main lagaataar badlaav kii ranneeti apanaayi
 This slowed the run pace and meanwhile India were also successful in taking wickets of Joe Root (3) and Moin Ali (12)
 in donon ko bhubaneshwar ne out kiya
 England managed only 67 runs in 26 overs this season
 tisare satr main pari samaapt ghoshit karne se pehle english team ne keval 18
 144 runs in 3 overs
 subah bel ne kuch der gendbaajon ko parakhane ke baad aakraamakata dikhaayi
 He even hit the first six of the match on Jadeja
 balance ne shandaar farm barkaraar rakhte hue 115wein over main 23wein chauke kii madad se apane kariyar main pehali baar 150 ran puure kiye
 At this time, Dhoni gave the ball to Rohit and he was successful in dismissing the balance two overs before lunch
 teji se gumti gend main thodaa oochaal tha
 She went behind the wicket after hitting the Thai pad of the balance and Dhoni caught it well
 bharatiyon kii apil par ampire rad takar kii ungali uth gayi or is tarah se rohit apana pehla test wicket lene main safal rahe
 Bell, however, gave a befitting reply to this negative strategy
 unhone pari ke 135wein over main jadeja par chakka jadkar 179 gendon par apana shatak puraa kiya
 He hit two fours and a six off the next three balls of the same over
 bhubaneshwar ne iske baad moin ko short pich gend par out kiya
 He would have also taken his third wicket as Butler but the third umpire gave him not out
 tab anjiky rahane ne duusari slip main kaaphi neeche rahata hua kaich liya tha
 Butler did not even open an account at that time
 butler ne chaay ke vishram ke baad bel ke saath teji dikhaayi
 He hit Jadeja for a six and took the team's score beyond 500 runs
 isse pehle jab vah 23 ran par the tab shami kii gend par slip main shikhar dhawan ne unhen jeevandaan diya
 He completed his first half-century off 64 balls
 bel ke out hone ke baad butler pankaj ke ek over main do chakke or ek chaukaa lagaaya
 He also refrained from running out in the middle but in an effort to pull on Jadeja, the ball took the edge of his bat and fell into the wickets
 butler ne 83 gend kheli or nau chauke or teen chakke lagaaye

 Sonam Kapoor made her stand in support of Hirani
 unhone kaha tha- ''maine un mahilaon kii baat par hameshaa bharosa kiya he, jo mitu movement ke dauraan aage ai thim
 But as far as Hirani's case is concerned, we should preserve our opinion on it for the time being

 Secondly, i have known Personally Rajkumar Hirani for a long time and respect him very much as a filmmaker

 jab bharat vishwa main badi aarthik shakti banakar china ko peeche chhodega, tab usamen vishesh rup se gwalior-chambal anchal kaa vishesh yogadan hoga kyonki yahaan par har sansaadhan ke saath pratibhashali udhyami or kisaan hai
 It has also started and now the land of Chambal is ready to contribute to the progress of Madhya Pradesh and the country, not a dacoit
 yah baat mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne 'india tudeh ubharta chambal summit' main kahi
 Apart from him on the changing picture of Chambal, the event was attended by Union Minister of State for Rural Development Pradeep Jain and Bollywood actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui
 ab aabaad honge behadgwalior ke hotel ushaa kiran pales main india today kii ore se 16 june ko yojit ubharta chambal summit main mukhyamantri chouhan ne kaha, “chambal ke bihadon main ab shanti he
 There is no terror of dacoits and in the coming times the young entrepreneurs here will create a new identity
 rajya sarkaar isamen puri madad kar rahi he or chambal ke bihadon main aisa buniyadi dhaancha taiyaar karne main juty he, jisase naujavaanon ko madad mili
 The government is constructing an industrial corridor, which will start from the Chambal river to Morena, Gwalior, Shivpuri and Guna and will have industries on both sides of the national highway
 iske liye 5,000 hectare se zyada bhoomi kaa chayan bhi ho gaya he
 There are also plans to develop townships in the rugged Chambal area, which has millions of hectares of barren land, to use and scale up industries
 chambal anchal main 37 se zyada ejineering kalege hai or yahaan ke yuvaaon ko rajya se baahar nahin janaa pade, iske liye gwalior or indore main ity park banaae gaye hai
 Earlier companies like TCS and Infosys did not come in the state, but they are ready to put their projects here
 kendriya gramin vikaas rajya mantri pradeep jain kaa jor chambal ke sampurna vikaas ke liye pradesh sarkaar ko alag se niti banane par rahaa
 He said that if the state government sends any proposal to this effect, then they are ready to raise it before the Prime Minister
 jain ke mutabik ab to yah myth tut janaa chahie ki chambal main sirf dakait hi paidaa hote hai
 This region is the heart of the country and now a message should be sent across the country that a new stream of development will emerge from Chambal, but the plans and industrial proposals made for this need to be turned into reality
 ajukeshan hi kamyaabi kaa mantrasaal 2012 kii apni chaar filmon ke liye rashtriya puraskaar se navaaje gaye bollywood abhinayta navazuddin siddiki ne chote shahar ke yuvaaon ke bade khwaabon ko sach karne ke liye khud ke tallent par bharosa karne ko kaha
 Nawazuddin, who played the role of a dacoit in the film Paan Singh Tomar, narrated the reminiscences of the ravines of Chambal and gave a message to the youths here that they must hold education
 shiksha hi ek aisa rasta he, jo kadi mehnat kii ore badhaata he or isse kamyaabi jarur milti he
 Nawazuddin set his example and said that he was rejected several times, but he persevered and now his talent was honored
 is safalataa main unki shiksha kaa yogadan kaaphi rahaa he
 Ramadhankar Singh, Chancellor, ITM University, said, "crime thrives on economic and social anomalies, but education is the weapon that can remove this inequality
 yahi vajah he ki itm uniwarsity main puure desh ke saath chambal anchal ke 4,000 se zyada chaatr shikshit hokar duniya kii namigirami companiyon main yahaan kii pahchaan badal rahe hai
 "IPS officer Sanjay Jha, who played an important role in the elimination of dacoits in Chambal, said that the soil and water of Chambal instills passion in the people and that is why they show their determination
 dakaiton ke panpane kaa ek kaaran yah bhi rahaa ki dishaheen yuvak hathiyaaron ko lekar behad main baagi ban gaye
 Now the means of education and employment are developing in the region and it is expected that the youth will not contribute to the development of the country, but rebels
 summit main maujuud darshakon ne vaktaaon se sidhe sawaal kiye or isamen yah sahmati jarur najar ai dashakon se dakaiton ke liye kukhyat rahe chambal ke behad ab udaan bharne ke liye taiyaar he or ab jarurat he yahaan ke yuvaaon ko nai disha dene or aadharbhoot sanrachana taiyaar karne kii
 After this, the stream of development will come out from here, it will make a special contribution in the progress of the country

 lakhon mahilaon ke nijee data fasebuk ke saath saajha kiye gaye hai
 These data have been passed on to Facebook through period tracking apps
 ye jaankaree privesi international kii ek report se mili he
 These apps collect many personal information about women such as when the user's period started and stopped, the mood of the user, craving and sex life
 isamen 'aakhri baar kab sex kiya gaya' or 'koun sa contraceptive methd yuj kiya gaya' jaisi behad gopneey jaankariyaan bhi samil hai
 According to Buzzfeed News, this information has been sent to Facebook and used for target ads
 jin do eps kaa naam saamne aayaa he, usamen Maya or MIA Fem shaamil hai
 Maya was downloaded over 5 million times from Google Play and the App Store
 vahiin MIA Fem ke 2 million se bhi zyada yugers hai
 Maya and MIA Fem are period tracking apps
 ye donon eps yujar se kai tarah ke behad personal ditels maangate hai
 All this information was shared to Facebook via software developer kit i
e
 SDK
 fasebuk software development kit ek product he jiske tahat developers kisi oparating system ke liye eps banaate hai
 Under this, they track and make money by using Facebook's ad network
 privesi international ne paaya he ki donon maaya or mia fasebuk ke saath data share kar rahe the
 The data of this app is shared with Facebook as soon as the app is opened after installation
 Elle kii report ke mutabik maaya yugers ke sexual health data fasebuk ko bina yugers kii ijaajat ke de diya gaya he
 However, MIA Fem has taken permission from users
 lekin ye ap ne ye saaf nahin kiya he ki koun sa data colect kiya ja rahaa he
 a former Maya user told Bajfeed that advertisers are able to target specific ads by tracking data related to the user's mood, cycle and sex life
 isamen maheene ke kuch khaas samay ye imotional aids bhi push karte hai
 This makes the user spend more than necessary
 fasebuk ne bajfid news ko bataaya he ki fasebuk ne bazafid news ko bataaya ki SDK policy ke kisi bhi sambhavit ulanghan par charchaa karne ke liye prevasi international dwaara pahachaane gaye ap se sampark kiya gaya he
 At the moment it is not clear whether the data has been shared with anyone other than Facebook
 credit, debit card or ke net banking ke daur main aapke shopping ke bhugtan ke liye ek karier billing ek nae vikalp ke rup main saamne aa rahaa he
 ideacareer Billing became the first company to offer any mobile subscriber the facility of a mobile operator to buy digital content online
 isamen digital content kharidne ke liye bhugtan mobile company ke preeped yaa post ped bill main bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Telecom company Idea Cellular has become the first company to offer carrier billing option for purchases from the Google Play store
 app, game yaa software kharid sakate haniske tahat koi bhi edia graahak google play store se kharidari apane idia acount se bhugtan karke kar saktaa he
 Where the money paid for a prepaid customer is deducted from his prepaid balance, for the postpaid customer this money comes by adding to his monthly bill
 yani kisi credit, debit card yaa netbanking kii suvidha ke bina bhi graahak google play store se digital content jaise app, game yaa software kharid saktaa he
 The rationale behind this feature is that mobile phones have many times more customers than any card or net banking and hence can become a strong payment option
 puri tarah se nahin he credit cardlekin philhal is suvidha se software jaisi vahi sevaayen kharidi ja sakati hai jiskaa istemaal bhi phone par ho sake
 But this credit card does not work completely
 yani iskaa istemaal aap online shopping main philhal nahin kar paaenge
 But Idea COO Laxminarayan believes this may be possible in the coming time, provided there are no regulatory issues and the entire blueprint or ecosystem is ready
 philhal aap wo chijen yaa sevaayen karier billing ke jariye nahin kharid sakate jo aap phone par istemaal nahin kar sakate
 That is, your phone account has started becoming a credit card, but it will take time to replace your credit card
 ye badlaav kitni teji se hoga ye graahakon, sarkaar or telecom company or online companiyon par nirbhar karegaa

 search ingine google ne ek bada you-turn letaa hue internet par duniya bhar main bacchon kii ashleel tasveeron se sambandhit khoj ko block karne kaa faisla kar liya he
 Google boss Eric Smith said on Monday that the search engine has developed a technology that will make finding pornographic images of children on the Internet extremely difficult
 unhone bataaya ki internet par ashleel tasveeron kii khoj ke liye istemaal kiye jane vaale ek lakh se adhik shabdon par ab koi parinaam nahin aayega
 Along with this, a message showing indecent photographs of children is illegal
 shuruyaat main yah pratibandh angreji bhashi deshon par hi hoga, lekin agle 6 maheenon main yah duniya ke baaki hisson or 158 anya bhashaaon par bhi lagu ho jayega
 Let us tell you that in July this year, UK Prime Minister David Cameron had appealed to Google and Microsoft's search engine Bing to make it difficult for people to access such illegal pictures
 yahi nahin unhone chetavanee bhi di thi ki agar aisa nahin kiya gaya to wo iske khilaaf nayaa vidheyak lekar aaenge
 These companies then created an algorithm that prohibits the discovery of pornographic images of children
 erik ne bataaya ki google ne pichley teen maheenon se 200 se bhi zyada karmchaariyon ko is samasya ke samaadhaan kaa upaay dhundne par lagaaya hua tha
 He said, "however, no algorithm can be the best and Google cannot prevent people from uploading pictures of child sexual abuse to the Internet
" lekin aise ek lakh se adhik shabdon par ab koi parinaam nahin aayega, jo bacchon kii ashleel tasveeron or bal yon shoshan se jude ho sakate hai

 During the hearing in the said case, the High Court had asked the police how Kanhaiya Kumar was responsible for the sloganeering when the outside students allegedly shouted slogans after coming to JNU? The police had argued that Kanhaiya was involved in the February 9 program and raised slogans
 police ne kaha tha ki unke paas swatantra gavaah hai, jinamein jeenyu adhikari, chif security adhikari va kuch chaatr shaamil hai

 isi maamle main police ne jeenyu parisar se chaatr umr khalid or anirbaan bhattacharya ko bhi giraftaar kiya tha
 Let it be known that on Monday, two days ago, the High Court reserved its decision in the said case
 pichhali sunwaayee par dilli police ne kanhaiya kii jamaanat par virodh darj karaate hue daleel di thi ki video main kanhaiya narebaaji karata nahin dikh rahaa he, lekin unke paas aise gavaah hai, jinke saamne kanhaiya ne narebaaji kii thi
 The police gave this argument after a question asked by the High Court, in which the High Court asked if they had CCTV or any other evidence to prove that Kanhaiya was shouting slogans? At the same time, Kanhaiya's lawyer Kapil Sibal had said that Kanhaiya had gone to settle the fight there and he did not raise anti-national slogans
 hoicourt ne ukt maamle main sunwaayee ke dauraan sawaal uthaate hue police se poocha tha ki kaise kanhaiya kumaar narebaaji ke liye jimmedaar he, jab kathith taur par bahari chaatro ne jeenyu main aakar narebaaji kii he? police ne daleel di thi ki kanhaiya nau farvari ke kaarykram main shaamil tha or usne narebaaji kii thi
 The police had said that they have independent witnesses, including JNU officers, Chief Security Officers and some students
 haalanki police ne yah bhi mana tha ki video main kanhaiya narebaaji karata nahin dikh rahaa he
 Police had said that there was no CCCTV where the event took place
 is stage par jamaanat die jane se galat sandesh jayega
 After JNU, similar slogans have also been raised in Jadhavpur University
 vahiin kuch logon ne video banaai thi, jisamen kanhaiya maukey par maujuud he
 On this, the court asked why when the police had evidence, why did they wait for the first video to be played on the TV channel
 
 
 khud karrwai kyon nahin kii?tippaniyan It may be known that on the last hearing Kanhaiya's lawyer had said that there is no evidence against Kanhaiya
 vahiin jeenyu koi public place nahin he, isliye kanhaiya par public place par updrav ke liye uksaane kaa maamla nahin banataa he
 In this case, while the Delhi Police opposed Kanhaiya's bail, the Delhi government had argued to grant Kanhaiya's bail
 dilli sarkaar ke standing council rahul mehara ne hoicourt main kaha tha ki kanhaiya ke khilaaf koi thos saboot nahin hai
 No innocent person can be punished
 saath hi kaha tha ki kanhaiya ko desh-virdohi postaron ke liye jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa he

 It is worth mentioning that JNU Students Union President Kanhaiya Kumar is accused of raising anti-national slogans during a function on 9 February on the JNU campus
 is maamle kaa video ek tivi channel par prasaarit hone ke baad bavaal machaa tha
 After this, Delhi Police registered a case of treason in this regard and arrested Kanhaiya on 12 February

 Sources have been quoted saying that the Shiv Sena can walk out of the Rajya Sabha while voting on the bill

 shivasena ne pehle hi kaha he ki sarkaar agar naagarikta bill par unki shankaaon ko dur nahin karti he to ve bill kaa virodh kar sakate hai

 Sanjay Raut said that Shiv Sena does not want such a certificate of patriotism from anyone

 On the other hand, after the announcement of Amit Shah and Nitish Kumar, Union minister Upendra Kushwahane Tejashwi Yadav, associate of NDA in Bihar, met in Arwal and also discussed the Lok Sabha elections

 Media reports have revealed that LJP is not ready to contest less than 7 seats, whereas BJP does not seem ready to give so many seats

 com / wjzttdgftx— ANI (@ani)october 26, 2018paswan ke bare main kaha ja rahaa he ki ve kharaab sehat kii vajah se loksabhaa chunaav nahin ladanaa chaahate
 Instead he would like to go to Rajya Sabha
 iske liye sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he ki unki party 7 siton kii maang se peeche hat jaae or bijepi jin siton par baat kare, us par donon partiyon main sahmati ban jaae
 However, until an official announcement about it is made, it is being considered as speculative
 seat shering kaa elaan hone ke baad algepi netaa chiraag paswan ne kaaphi saavdhaanee ke saath bayaan diya or kaha ki unki party endie gathbandhan ko or majboot karne main lagi he
 However, later many LJP leaders appeared angry with Shah and Nitish's seat sharing formula and expressed their displeasure at the 'weight' being given to JDU
 sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki algepi ko 6 seat di ja sakati he, jabaki paswan kii party 7 se kam par taiyaar nahin dikhti
 If Upendra Kushwaha resides in the NDA, the BJP can contest 16 seats, JDU also 16 seats, LJP 5, RLSP 2 and RLSP suspended Arun Kumar one seat, according to Rajya Sabha bets for Paswan
 
 in siton ke ganit main algepi or araspi kaa naaraaz hona saaf dikhataa he kyonki bihar algepi ke adhyaksh or paswan ke chote bhai pashupati kumaar paras khuleam bol chuke hai ki unki party ko 7 se kam siten nahin chahie
 In such a situation, the lack of 2 seats can spoil the relationship with BJP, but the strategy of sending Paswan from Rajya Sabha may be at stake in it further
 udhar, upendra kushavaah kii naaraazgi lambey dinon se charchaa kaa vishay he
 They have been putting pressure on BJP for seat sharing for a long time
 shuukravaar ko tejasvi yadav se mulaakaat ke baad ye mana ja rahaa he ki kushavaah kii party araspi endie main nahin rahegi
 In such a situation, the mathematics of seats can be moved here and there
 sutron kii maane to aisi sthiti main bijepi 17, jediu bhi 17, lojpa 5 or arun kumaar ek seat par chunaav lard sakate hai
 Paswan, who will go to Rajya Sabha from Assam, is said to have been an eight-time MP from Bihar and LJP President Ram Vilas Paswan will not contest from Hajipur in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 sutron ke mutabik, ramvilas paswan ko bijepi assam se april 2019 main rajyasabha bhej sakati he
 If Paswan does not contest the elections and BJP sends him from the Rajya Sabha to Parliament, then the seat sharing of NDA in Bihar will be this - BJP 17, JDU also 17 seats, LJP 5 (seeking one seat from Salempur or Deoria) and RLSP
 Arun Kumar suspended, one seat from Jehanabad

 The first alarm bell rang in this direction in October last year when a jewelery maker named Govind Johri was arrested in Delhi
 usne echsiel company ke sansthaapak shiv nader kii patni or kala sangraahak kiran nader ko behad kharaab kism ke aabhushan beche the
 According to the police, Kiran had been buying precious jewels from this jeweler for several decades, but this time he decided to get some of them tested
 unhone paaya ki na sirf kuch behad kharaab kism ke ratna the balki kai to unamem nakli bhi the
 India Today wrote a letter to Kiran's public relations unit Six Degrees PR and his HCL office in October and then in April but no response came from anywhere
 us vakt jaipur ke johariyon ne unke maamle ko ek ''apwaad'' bataaya tha
 India Today came to know that after this incident, some well-known businessmen and jewelers also checked the pages kept in their treasury
 disambar, 2011 main jaipur sthit jem testing laboratory (jitiel) ne paaya ki bazaar main regin se sane hue pannon kii bharmaar thi
 GTL is run by the James & Jewelery Export Promotion Council of Jaipur

 According to GTL officials, between January and March three lakh rupees

 This stuffed material hides the stone cracks and enhances its shine

 The authorities paid a businessman a quarter to two crore

 There were cracks on it and it was shining
 jaipur sthit sanstha frends international ke maalik johari omprakash dangich kehete hai, ''bade paimaane par ho rahe is farjivade kaa hi nateeja he ki hamaare dhandhe main aaj baari avishvaas paidaa ho gaya he

 However, chairman of Jaipur Jewelers Association, Nirmal Kumar Baradia told India Today that this is not such a big problem
 unke shabdon main, ''bilawajeh itnaa drama khadaa kiya ja rahaa he
 It is a deal between two people and if one party is not satisfied with that deal then he is free to return it
 ''lekin iske baavjood kai maamalon main vyapaaree paisa lautaane se inkaar bhi kar chuke hai
 Due to this, the customer has to be satisfied with the poor quality of the cash

 Jewelers' firms are benefiting from this

 According to a statement issued by GTL Deputy Director Gagan Chaudhary in March 2012, "the fact that the cracks in the pages have been filled up has caused sleepless nights for the people involved in this business
" paardarshita na hone kii vajah se kharidaaron kaa bharosa uthta ja rahaa he
 After testing at GTL, between 2009 and 2011, on an average 80 pages were found to be fake every month
 is baar isaki sankhya 600 ko paar kar gai to yah bayaan jari karne kii naubat ai
 Chaudhary says, "in the first month, barely a single case used to come with resin-coated pages
" '' jitiel main is saal akavle janvari main hi aise 150 panne paae gaye
 According to Chaudhary, the original ore from which the emerald is extracted is often mixed with resins
 is vajah se khud johari bhi daraaron ko pakad paane main naakaam rahe hai
 When such pieces are threaded in the jewelery, only then its cracks are known
 heere kii tarah aise pattharon kaa vargeekaran nahin kiya gaya he
 Kala says, "we should work towards classifying different classes
 paardarshita main kami kii vajah se hi to yah farjivada hua he
 "the organizations of jewelers and traders have not taken any action so far

 In such a situation, it is difficult to get hold of who has filled his cracks in the meantime

 sarkaar ke 6 maheene ke kaarykaal ko dekhen to teen talaak samaapt karne, kashmir se dhara 370 hataane jaise bade faisle hue
 At the same time, the resolution of the oldest issue of Ram temple has also been resolved by the Supreme Court order during this period of the Modi government
 haalanki, aarthik morche par modi sarkaar ko aalochanaon kaa bhi saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 At the same time, these 6 months will not be called good for the party sitting in power in terms of electoral success
 maharashtra bijepi ke haath se khisak gaya he or varshon purana saathi bhi saath chhodkar chalaa gaya
 In Haryana too, power has to be saved with the help of Baikhasi
 30 may 2019 ko nai sarkaar ke shapath grahan ke baad pehali baar maharashtra or haryana main bijepi ko chunaav kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Although the party won the most seats in both states, the results did not go as expected

 If the law against triple talaq goes a little before this latest setback of Maharashtra, 6 months of Modi government witnessed many major decisions
 duusari baar satta main aate hi modi sarkaar ne sabase pehle muslim mahilaon ko teen talaak se nijaat dilaane kaa kadam uthaaya
 The 'muslim Women Marriage Protection Protection Bill-2019' was passed by the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha main bahumat na hone ke baad bhi modi sarkaar is kanoon ko amalijama pehanaane main kaamyaab rahi
 Article 370, removed from Kashmir, was an issue that has always been a part of the bjp's election manifesto
 saal-dar saal is par charchaa hoti rahi or maang hoti rahi ki kashmir se kab yah dhara hataai jaaegi
 After running the government for five years (2014-19), when the Modi government came back with more strength for the second time, this decision was also taken in Parliament

 In response to a question in the current winter session, Amit Shah had said that the NRC process is monitored by the Supreme Court and there is no provision in the NRC to say that people of other religions will not be included in it
 
 unhone kaha ki yah puure desh main lagu kiya jayega or kisi ko bhi isse darane kii jarurat nahin he
 Economy-bound government may call upon NRC not to fear, but the slow pace of GDP has left everyone in awe
