 It has been said in the study that problems in a person's life start from the time when he starts comparing himself to other people
 aisa karnaa uske aatmavishvaas ke liye ghaatak sabit ho saktaa he
 Today people are so conscious about their physical height that it becomes a cause of stress for them
 haal hi main hui ek study ke mutabik soshal media par active rahane vaale log khud ko dusron kii tulana main aksar kamatar aankane lagate hai
 5 different research studies were done on social media, in which it has been confirmed that people sharing their photos on social media are feeling inferior
 sabase pehle is survey main bhaag lene vaale uniwarsity ke 227 ladakiyon ko shaamil kiya gaya
 The survey revealed that girls compare themselves to their friends the most
 iske alaava wo fasebuk par femes celibrities kii editid tasviren dekhakar bhi pareshaan ho jaati hai
 This survey also revealed that girls never compare themselves to their family members
 aise main in logon ko ye samajhnaa jaruri he ki jo tasviren fasebuk par dekhne ko milti hai wo aadhi sachai hoti hai
 We never get to know what is going on in that person's life from the photographs uploaded on social media
 is baat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ek or study kii gai, is study main yah kaha gaya he ki ham fasebuk or instagram par jis tarah ke pej follow karte hai hamaara vyaktitv bhi vaisaa hi ban jaataa he
 This study conducted by Amy Steller studied 160 undergraduate girls' instagram
 study ke parinaamon main pataa chalaa ki jo ladkiyaan sirf # fitspo pej follow karti hai, unke andar lo self compaishan dekha gaya
 On the other hand, if the girls read positive things, then the inferiority complex could not develop in them and they were full of confidence
 iske baad jis study ke bare main baat kii gai, wo study kam or ek test zyada tha
 In this study, the girls were asked to take out their most beautiful pictures and write 10 lines about it
 is test ke jariye yah pataa chalaa ki ladkiyaan apni shaareerik sudanrata ko zyada mahatv detii hai naa kii apni andruni sudanrata ko
 They are more concerned about how they look and not about how human they are
 vahiin duusari ek study main is baat kaa daawa kiya gaya ki lagaataar lee gai kai selfi ke baavjood bhi ladkiyaan apane andar aatmavishvaas nahin jagaa paati hai
 In these pictures, they always see flaws somewhere
 itnaa hi nahin wo apni tasviir kii tulana apane doston ke saath bhi karti hai
 In this study, undergraduate girls were asked to share their selfies on Instagram or Facebook
 aisa karte samay ek shart bhi rakhi gai
 The condition was that one group got an opportunity to edit its selfie while the other group was forbidden to do something like this
 is study main pataa chalaa ki ladakiyon ko apni tasviir main sirf khamiyaan hi najar ain
 He had a chance to improve that picture, despite this his focus was only on the negative things
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den, is tarah kii aadat sirf ladakiyon main hi nahin balki is shodh main ladakon main bhi dekhi gai he
 They tend to underestimate themselves by seeing more fit people than themselves
 khayr, in study ko dekhakar is nishkarsh par pahunchaa gaya ki vyakti ko apana man un chizon main nahin lagaana chahie jahaan hin bhaavana paidaa hone kii gunjaaish bani hui ho
 Instead, one should follow tourism, nature related pages on social media, doing so brings peace of mind and we stop comparing ourselves to others
 aapako bataa den, ham aapako soshal media chhodane ke liye nahin kah rahe hai, lekin haa, aap iskaa behatar istemaal kar sakate hai
 Use it to increase confidence and not to decrease

 Dear Gajendra ji aapako main tab se jaanata hum, jab se aapane mahabharat main yudhisthir kaa kirdaar adaa kiya
 Then Mahabharata waited impatiently to see
 aapke kirdaar ne mujhe kaaphi prabhavit kiya tha
 This character based on religion and truth has also helped the youth to learn a lot
 lekin mahabharat khatm hone ke baad aap kahin kisi film yaa serial main kisi badi bhoomika main dikhaai nahin die
 Maybe because of my lack of interest in the film, i could not see any good character from you
 aajkal aap jaanate hai ki aap surkhiya main kyon hai ? aapke apatiai kaa chairman ban jane ke baad to jaise ek or 'mahabharat' shuru ho gaya he
 Students in your organization do not want you to remain the chairman
 kuch din pehle aapaki sanstha ke chaatr jantar-mantar par pradarshan karne ke liye pahunche the
 You yourself can understand how much the matter has increased
 sirf chaatr hi kyon aapke saathi kalakaar bhi aapke saath nahin hai
 Many big artists have also asked you to know from this post
 kai baar aap yah bayaan de chuke hai ki yah protest raajnneeti se prerit he or kuch rajaneta is protest ke peeche hai
 i also believe that some politicians want to run their shop through this movement
 jantar-mantar par jab main aapaki sanstha ke chaatro se baat kar rahaa tha to unka kahana tha ki vah protest isiilie nahin kar rahe hai ki aap bijepi se jude hue hai, unka sawaal aapke calibur ko lekar he
 The students also said that people associated with BJP like Anupam Kher or Paresh Rawal would be happy if they became the chairman
 aapako yah bhi maananaa hoga kii protest chaatro ke dwaara hi shuru kiya gaya tha
 Politicians jumped into this movement when it was of no avail

 Let me tell you that this is not the first time that a politician is becoming the chairman of FTII, yes it is definitely the first time that there is such a strong movement against a leader becoming a chairman
 san 2001 main jab vinod khanna apatiai ke adhyaksh bane the tab bhi vah bijepi ke saansad the or centre main bijepi kii sarkaar thi
 Only Vinod Khanna, UR Ananthamurthy, who became the chairman of FTII in 2005, were also associated with politics somewhere

 Let us assume that you are the right candidate for this post, but the question arises that if you are not able to explain to your students for so many days then what will you do next? You don't think it's your failure
 main yah nahin kahata ki aap apatiai ke chairman banane ke kaabil nahin hai
 i also believe that you should get a chance, but if this opportunity does not enchant the students' mind, then you should free this opportunity from your fist by presenting greatness
 vaise bhi aap mahabharat main yudhisthir kaa kirdaar nibhaa chuke hai
 Yudhishthira who followed the path of religion and justice
 usne to apane kaurav bhaaiyon ke liye hastinapur chhod diya tha to kya in chaatro ke liye aap apatiai ke chairman kaa pad chhod nahin sakate
 You have a chance to win the students' mind by becoming Yudhishthira again
 mujhe puraa bharosa he ki aap aisa hi karenge
 There is a line in the Mahabharata that reminds you, "there is no interruption of sorrow, no happiness, but the lines of fate also complicate time
" " is pankti ko aap kaise dekhte hai, yah aap par hi nirbhar karata he
 The comments aapkaa Sushil Kumar Mohapatra aapako main tab se jaanata hum, jab se aapane mahabharat main yudhisthir kaa kirdaar adaa kiya
 Then Mahabharata waited impatiently to see
 aapke kirdaar ne mujhe kaaphi prabhavit kiya tha
 This character based on religion and truth has also helped the youth to learn a lot
 lekin mahabharat khatm hone ke baad aap kahin kisi film yaa serial main kisi badi bhoomika main dikhaai nahin die
 Maybe because of my lack of interest in the film, i could not see any good character from you
 aajkal aap jaanate hai ki aap surkhiya main kyon hai ? aapke apatiai kaa chairman ban jane ke baad to jaise ek or 'mahabharat' shuru ho gaya he
 Students in your organization do not want you to remain the chairman
 kuch din pehle aapaki sanstha ke chaatr jantar-mantar par pradarshan karne ke liye pahunche the
 You yourself can understand how much the matter has increased
 sirf chaatr hi kyon aapke saathi kalakaar bhi aapke saath nahin hai
 Many big artists have also asked you to know from this post
 kai baar aap yah bayaan de chuke hai ki yah protest raajnneeti se prerit he or kuch rajaneta is protest ke peeche hai
 i also believe that some politicians want to run their shop through this movement
 jantar-mantar par jab main aapaki sanstha ke chaatro se baat kar rahaa tha to unka kahana tha ki vah protest isiilie nahin kar rahe hai ki aap bijepi se jude hue hai, unka sawaal aapke calibur ko lekar he
 The students also said that people associated with BJP like Anupam Kher or Paresh Rawal would be happy if they became the chairman
 aapako yah bhi maananaa hoga kii protest chaatro ke dwaara hi shuru kiya gaya tha
 Politicians jumped into this movement when it was of no avail
 agar aapane chaatro kii baat maan lee hoti to aaj rajaneta iskaa phayda na uthaa pate

 When Vinod Khanna became the chairman of FTII in 2001, he was still a BJP MP and had a BJP government at the Center
 sirf vinod khanna kyon, you aar ananthamurti, jo 2005 main apatiai ke adhyaksh bane the, vah bhi kahin na kahin raajnneeti se jude the
 He contested as an independent candidate against BJP and was supported by Janata Dal Secular
 chaliye ham maan hi lete hai ki aap is pad ke liye sahi umidavaar hai, lekin sawaal yah uthta he ki agar aap itane din tak apane chaatro ko samajha nahin paae to phir aage kya karenge ? aapako lagata nahin yah aapaki vifaltaa he
 i do not say that you are not capable of becoming the chairman of FTII
 main bhi maanata hum ki aapako ek mauka milanaa chahie, lekin yah mauka agar chaatro ke man ko mugdh nahin kar paaya to aapako mahanata kaa parichay dete hue is maukey ko apane mutthi se mukt kar dena chahie
 Anyway, you have played the role of Yudhishthira in the Mahabharata
 vah yudhisthir jo dharm or nyaay kaa rasta apanaataa tha
 He had left Hastinapur for his Kaurava brothers, so can't you leave the post of chairman of FTII for these students
 aapke paas ek mauka he phir yudhisthir banakar chaatro kaa man jeetne kaa
 i am confident that you will do the same

 The impact of Rahul Gandhi's political strategy to land Congress leaders is beginning to show
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main siton kii badhottaree ke baad rajasthan ke upachunaav main mili jeet ne congress ke is siyaasi prayog par muhar laga diya he
 Congress's success has left the BJP restless
 prachand bahumat se desh kii satta par 2014 main kabiz, 19 rajyon main sarkaar chalaa rahi duniya kii sabase badi raajnneetik party bijepi ke vijay rath ke pahie ko congress rokane kii jaddojahad kar rahi he
 BJP is trying to move forward with the slogan 'congress Mukt Bharat'
 2014 ke chunaav ke baad se congress haashie par gai thi
 In such a situation, Rahul Gandhi has taken command of the Congress in his hands
 kai chunaavon main haar kaa saamana karne ke baad rahul gandhi ne samaj liya tha ki bijepi se nipatane ke liye party netaaon ko jameen par utaarna hoga
 Without this the party cannot be rejuvenated
 aise main rahul ne apana puraa dhyaan rajasthan main party kii kaman sachin payalat, or gujarat main ashok gahalot ko jimmedaari dekar congress ko jamini str par majboot karne par lagaaya
 Pilot's on-the-ground hard work When Pilot was given command of the party in Rajasthan, the Congress had only 21 mlas at that time
 vidhansabha chunaav main haar ke baad loksabhaa main rajya se puri tarah se party kaa safaya ho gaya tha
 Pilot worked hard to bring the marginalized Congress alive
 kisaanon ke mudde se lekar vasundhara raaje sarkaar ke khilaaf sadak par utre or party sanghathan ko majboot kiya
 In Rajasthan, the Congress won from the student union elections to the municipal and district panchayat elections
 iske alaava rajya main ab tak hue 6 upachunaav main se 4 congress ne jiti he
 The results of two Lok Sabha and one Vidhan Sabha elections in favor of Congress on Thursday are evidence of the bjp's sliding base
 gujarat main bijepi kaa chuta pasinapradhanmantri narendra modi ke grih rajya gujarat ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko apni satta bachaane main paseene chhot gaye
 For the first time in the last two decades, BJP could not touch the figure of 100 seats and had to satisfy 99 seats
 vahiin congress gathbandhan ko 80 siten mili, mahaj 11 siton se wo satta se dur rah gai
 The credit for bringing the Congress into the role of a strong opposition in Gujarat goes to party general secretary Ashok Gehlot
 gahalot ne rajya main pichley 6 maheene rahakar party ko jamini str par majboot karne kaa kaam kiya
 Part of Gehlot's plan was that Rahul Gandhi visit temples in Gujarat
 iske alaava rajya main jaateey andolan karne vaale yuva netaaon ko apane saath milaayaa
 Congress has got Sanjivani in the state
 party sakriy bhoomika nibhaati hui najar aa rahi he
 Scindia's struggle on the roads of Madhya Pradesh The Congress has been away from power in Madhya Pradesh for the last 15 years and the BJP is sitting
 rajya sarkaar ke khilaaf congress ko jameen par utaarne kaa kaam jyotiraditya sindhiya kar rahe hai
 Scindia is the face of the party in the state
 mana ja rahaa he party adhyaksh rahul gandhi unhen siem ummidavaar ke taur par utaar sakate hai
 In such a situation, Scindia has been continuously campaigning against the Shivraj government of the state for a long time
 kisaanon ke mudde se lekar kanoon vyavastha or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf sindhiya sadak par hai
 They are encamped in the state
 isi kaa nateeja he ki haal hi main rajya main raghogarh kii nagar palika kii 24 siton main se 20 par congress ne jeet darj kii he
 Apart from this, the Congress won the victory in the by-elections in Chitrakoot Assembly and ratlam-jhabua Lok Sabha seat
 aath maheene ke baad rajya main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav se pehle bijepi ke khilaaf maahaul banane ke liye wo in dinon jameen par utre hue hai
 Party General Secretary Rahul Gandhi, who was trying to get the Congress to take a break in the upcoming assembly elections of Uttar Pradesh, called upon the youth to change this state and claimed that the state's picture will change in 10 years if the Congress is formed in the state
 rahul ne pradesh ke apane paanch divasiy chunavi daure ke pehle din yahaan ek jansabha main kaha ki uttar pradesh ke yuva is pradesh ko bahut aasaani se badal sakate hai, lekin sarkaar ne unke haath baandh rakhe hai
 Under the rule of non-congress government, their future is slipping from the hands of the youth in the state
 naujavaanon ko apana mustakabil waapas chhinana hoga
 After repeating the promise of changing the picture of the state after the upcoming assembly elections, he said, "take me in writing, the change will begin in the state in five years after the formation of the Congress government and in 10 years, seeing the progress of the state People from other states will start coming here
 unhone kaha ki uttar pradesh ke log rojgaar ke liye maharashtra, haryana, dilli or punjab aadi rajyon main jaakar vahaan ke vikaas main yogadan kar rahe hai
 After the formation of the Congress government in this state, the youth will get employment in their own state and they will be able to contribute to the development of their state
 rahul ne sattarudh bahujan samaaj party (basapa) or mukhya vipakshi dal samaajawaadee party (sapa) par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, pradesh kii janata ne sapa par bharosa kiya lekin use kuch nahin mila
 Then trusted the BSP, but he got corruption
 rahul ne kisi kaa naam liye bagaiyr kaha ki garibi ko gaharaai se samajhane ke liye gaanvon ke logon ke bich janaa, unka bhojan khaanaa or unka pani pinaa jaruri he
 But your leaders do not even land on the ground
 ve to helicopter se hi chizon ko dekhte hai
 One has to get down on the ground to know the reality
 congress mahasachiv ne kaha, kuch samay pehle maharashtra gaya to uttar pradesh ke nivasee ek ladke ne meraa haath pakad liya or kaha ki shivasena ke log use tang karte hai
 He asked when he would get employment in his state
 in sab baton ko sunakar mujhe gussa aata he
 Rahul once again accused the Mayawati government of snatching the farmers' land and firing on the farmers who demanded a fair price for the land
 saath hi unhone mukhyamantri mayawati par rashtriya gramin rojgaar guarantee yojana (naregaa) ko kathith rup se vyarth bataane kaa iljaam bhi rakhaa
 The Congress leader said that the Central Government has brought a bill related to land acquisition, but Mayawati and others of the opposition are engaged in eliminating it secretly in the relevant committee of Parliament
 unhone kendra dwaara naregaa tathaa janani suraksha samet vibhinn yojanaon ke tahat bheje jane vaale dhan ko uttar pradesh sarkaar dwaara hadap liye jane kaa aarope bhi doharaaya or kaha ki isse aam janata ko hi nuksaan hota he
 The Congress general secretary also criticized the Bharat Shining slogan of the bjp-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and said, "hindustan will not shine as long as the country is poor

 The party asked Shinde to sack and apologize unconditionally to Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, but the Congress refused to accept the bjp's demand
 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke pravaktaa ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki scindia kii tippanee gairajavabdeh or nindaneey he or congress vot bank kii raajnneeti kar rahi he
 He said, "I strongly condemn it
" yah bina damakham vaale us grih mantri kaa ghrunit bayaan he jise yahi nahin pataa ki vah kya kehane ja rahaa he
 "he said that on January 24, the BJP would protest against Shinde's statement throughout the country and burn the effigy of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government
 rajyasabha main pratipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne kaha, "scindia ne jo kaha he use sabit karen yaa phir ve apana bayaan waapas len yaa maafee maangen
 " congress pravaktaa raashid alvi ne kaha ki scindia ko hataane yaa maafee maangane kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 The Congress spokesperson said, "shinde has made it clear that he meant Mecca Masjid, Samjhauta Express and Malegaon blast
 isamen sanlipt log jelon main band hai or unhone kaha tha ki yah tathy akhabaaron main aa chukaa he
 " gyaat ho ki congress ke chetana shivi main scindia ne ravivaar ko hindu aatankwaad or bhagava aatankwaad ke sambandh main tippanee kar tufaan khadaa kar diya
 Later, the Home Minister made it clear that he was just stating that all this has come in the media and he was referring to 'saffron terrorism'
 prasad ne kaha ki bhagava shabd bhartiya parampara main 'pavitra' mana jaataa he or yah desh kii aadhyatmik viraasat se sambhddha he
 He said that it is one of the three colors of the national flag and is also associated with our freedom struggle
 tippaniyan Asked what it means to link the holy word to terrorism, he said that the BJP and the RSS never said that punishment should not be given to the perpetrators of terrorism
 unhone kaha ki bhagava ko aatankwaad se jodne ko bhaajapa kabhi bardaasht nahin karegi
 Prasad said that Sonia and Manmohan apologize unconditionally and Shinde should be sacked
 unhone kaha ki pakistan main aatankwaad ke aakaa scindia ke bayaan se behad khush honge
 He said that the Indian Mujahideen activists were arrested for their involvement in terrorist acts, but the BJP never linked it to religion
 unhone sawaal uthaaya, "kya kabhi hamane kaha he muslim aatankwaad? aatankwaad kaa koi dharm nahin hota
 " party ne scindia ko barkhaast karne or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi evam pradhanmantri manmohan singh se bina shart maafee maangane ke liye kaha, lekin congress ne bhaajapa kii maang maanane se inkaar kar diya
 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said that Shinde's remarks were irresponsible and condemnable and the Congress was doing vote bank politics
 unhone kaha, "main isaki ghor ninda karata hum
 This is a disgusting statement of a homeless minister who does not know what he is going to say
 " unhone kaha ki 24 janvari ko bhaajapa puure desh main scindia ke bayaan ke khilaaf pradarshan karegi or sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) sarkaar kaa putala phunkegi
 Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley, said, "prove what Shinde has said or withdraw his statement or apologize
 " Congress spokesperson Rashid Alvi said that the question of removing Shinde or apologizing does not arise
 congress pravaktaa ne kaha, "scindia ne saaf kar diya he ki unka matlab makka masjid, samjhauta express or maalegaanv visphot se tha
 People involved in this are in jails and they said that this fact has come in the newspapers
 " It is to be known that at the Congress' Chetna camp, Shinde on Sunday raised a storm by commenting on Hindu terrorism and saffron terrorism
 baad main grih mantri ne saaf kiya tha ki ve sirf yah bataanaa chaah rahe the ki yah sab media main aayaa he or unka ishaara 'bhagava aatankwaad' kii ore tha
 Prasad said that the word saffron is considered 'sacred' in Indian tradition and is associated with the spiritual heritage of the country
 unhone kaha ki yah rashtriya dhvaj ke teen rangon main se ek he or hamaari aazaadee ke sangharsh se bhi judaa hua he
 The comments yah sawaal uthaate hue ki pavitra shabd ko aatankwaad se jodne kaa matlab kya he, unhone kaha ki bhaajapa or aresas ne kabhi nahin kaha ki aatankwaad ke doshiyon ko sajaa nahin do
 He said that BJP will never tolerate linking saffron to terrorism
 prasad ne kaha ki sonia or manmohan bina shart maafee maangen or scindia ko barkhaast kiya jaae
 He said that the handlers of terrorism in Pakistan would be very happy with Shinde's statement
 unhone kaa ki indian mujahidin ke kaaryakarta aatankwaadi karnaamon main sanliptata ke kaaran giraftaar hue hai, lekin bhaajapa ne kabhi ise dharm se nahin joda
 He questioned, "have we ever said Muslim terrorism? Terrorism has no religion

 a decision will be taken by noon
 main isse pehle kuch nahin kahuunga
 ' vaise to mata-pita apane bacchon ko kabhi bhi akele chhodkar janaa pasand nahin karte hai
 But many times the circumstances become such that they have to leave the child alone at home
 haalanki mata-pita apnebacchon ko akelaa tabhi chhodte hanjab wo khud is baat se aashwast ho jate hai ki unka baccha samajhadaar ho gaya he or kuch vakt ke liye khud ko sambhaal saktaa he
 But no matter how sensible the children may be, they make mistakes
 aise main unhen akelaa chhodana khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 But there is no need to be upset
 sirf kuch jaruri baton kaa dhyaan rakhkar aap apni chintaa ko kuch had tak kam kar sakate hai
 1
 bachche ke pasmobile jarur chodentaaki wo aapako samay-samay par suchit karata rahe or aap bhi vakt-vakt par uski khoj-khabar lete rahen
 2
 bachche ko kuch jaruri immergency number dekar jaaen taaki koi anhoni hone par wo madad ke liye kisi ko bula sake
 3
 bachche ko ghar ke kisi ek kone yaa kamare main band mat karen
 Otherwise he will not be able to come out if there is any untoward incident
 4
 Teach the child to close and open the door in front of you
 use ye bhi bataaen ki upar kii kundi lagane kii jagah wo neeche kii kundi lagaae
 5
 bachche kekhane-pine kii chijen dining teble par hi rakhkar jaaentaki bhukh lagane par wo kichan main na jaae
 There is always a danger of gas fire in the kitchen
 6
 Go by giving the child some homework so that he is busy with it
 homework na bhi ho to use kuch creative kaam dekar jaaen, jisase uskaa samay bhi jaldi biit jayega or wo kuch aisa nahin karegaa jo khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 If you live in Ghaziabad, adjacent to Delhi and want to buy a car that has been running for a few days, then this news of ours can prove to be special news for you! Police station Sahibabad has arrested 6 vicious people who used to prepare fake PAN cards, fake eye cards and fake documents to pass the loan of the new car and sell the vehicle in another area
 bank kii kisht jamaa na kiye jane par bank bhi inhen nahin dhund paata tha, lekin mubir kii soochna par police ne dhar dabocha
 The police have seized five luxury new cars, 5 new two wheelers, four fake PAN cards, two fake Aadhaar cards from their possession
 gajiabad main pichley kaaphi samay se ek aisa gang sakriy tha, joki farji kagajaat taiyaar karakarani karko bank ke lone ke jariye kharidte the or uskaa baqayada artio main bhi registration karaayaa karte the
 After this, he used to sell the vehicle in another area
 jab bank kii kist jamaa nahin ho paati thi to bank unke dwaara lagaae gaye kaagajon par likhe pate par jate the, to vahaan us naam kaa koi banda nahin miltaa tha
 Sahibabad police had received this complaint many times before, the police started searching for this gang, laying their net
 mubir kii soochna par police ne der raat sahibabad ilaake membikanerkat ke paas inhen us vakt dhardabocha, jab ve kisi shaks ko gaadi bechney kii firaaq main the
 On the basis of information, the police interrogated them, they said that they have recently bought five luxury cars and 5 two-wheelers based on fake papers, which were parked in different places in the parking lot
 The police seized all the vehicles
 Arrested and seized four fake PAN cards and two Aadhaar cards from their possession during searches
 police dwaara abhi inase gahan poochtacha kii ja rahi he ki isse pehle unhone farji kagajaat taiyaar kara kar kitni gaadiyaan koun-koun se bank se lone kara kar nikaali thi or vah kahaan-kahaan bechi gai he
 The police hope that after further interrogation, many more cars sold by cheating banks may be recovered from this gang
 loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon (election Results) se pehle aae agsit pole main congress (congress) ko uske ummid ke mutabik siten nahin milane kaa anumaan jataayaa gaya he, haalanki jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki party agar 100 kaa aankada paar karti he to yah uske or adhyaksh rahul gandhi (rahul Gandhi) ke liye thodi sahaj sthiti ho sakati he
 By the way, after reaching the floor with hail in the last Lok Sabha election (lok Sabha Election 2019), this time the centenary of seats is definitely a challenging target for the Congress
 duusari taraf dedh saal pehle party kii kaman sanbhaalane vaale rahul (rahul Gandhi) kii netritv kshamta kii pariksha bhi he
 However, the party believes that the Congress will do very well under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi
 congress (congress) 2014 ke aam chunaav main 44 siton par simat gai 
 This was the worst performance of the party so far
 chunaav purv or chunaav baad ke surveykshanon main congress (congress) kii siton main ijaphe kii baat kii ja rahi he, haalanki party ke aasaani se satta tak pahunchane kaa koi purvanumaan nahin he
 According to experts, the comfortable situation for the Congress would be that it reached the figure of 100, but if it does not, then Rahul Gandhi's leadership will also be questioned to some extent
 siesds ke nideshak sanjay kumaar kehete hai ki yah chunaav congress or rahul gandhi (rahul Gandhi) donon ke bhavishya ke liye mahatvapurn he
 i believe that if the Congress gets close to 100 seats, then it will be satisfactory for it

 police ne paanch anya kashmiri chaatro ko bhi hiraasat main liya tha lekin unhen baad main jane diya gaya
 Even before the students caught in Dehradun, many students have been detained for such activities
 haal hi main dehradun main alag-alag sansthaanon main padhai karne vaale do chaatro ne hamale kaa samarthan karte hue soshal media par post daal di
 After this, there was resentment among the people, after which the students were booked
 memu membhi hua tha bavaalvahin aligarh muslim uniwarsity (eemyu) ke ek kashmiri chaatr ne khushi jataate hue twit kiya tha
 After this tweet, a ruckus erupted and a complaint was lodged against the accused student
 teacher ko kiya gaya suspenbehal hi main guwahati main ek teacher ne fasebuk post main jammu or kashmir main nagarikon par atyaachaar ke liye bhartiya sena ko bhi doshi tehraaya tha

 We all have to face stress from time to time
 tanaav se bachane kaa tarika he, jo kuch bhi kar rahe hon, use chhod den or ek minute tak gahari saansen len
 You can also leave the shoulders, hands and fingers loose and then tighten
 sajagata banaae rakhane ke liye thodaa abhyaas jaruri he
 Whatever you are doing suddenly stop, remove the tension coming in the waist and hands and become aware of the surrounding environment
 phir apane aapse puuchhen ki kaisaa lag rahaa he
 Many times you may have felt that your body reacts when feeling hungry or thirsty or tired
 meri duusari beti gaganadip or mujhe bhukh va pyaas kaa pataa hi nahin chalata
 Only after fulfilling these needs, it is known that this was the reason for our stress and anger
 jaise-jaise umr badhati he, ham apni jaruraton par dhyaan nahin de pate
 The solution is to live in the present, ask yourself why this has been happening to you? Take out at least 30-40 minutes for yourself throughout the day
 is samay kuch bhi acha padhein, dhyaan lagaaein yaa vishleshan karen
 We cannot control the weather, rising inflation, boss or leader etc
 haa, aap in baton ko diary main likh sakate hai yaa kisi bharosemand dost ke saath baant sakate hai
 i also write a diary everyday, it is like my life in which i wrote openly on every kind of issue
 jab yah chhapi to iske chaar sanskaran haathon-haath nikal gaye
 The translation of the book written in English was also printed in Hindi and Punjabi
 meraa mitra mahesh hameshaa nakaaratmak vichaaron se ghira rahata tha or halaat ke liye swany ko doshi tehraata rahata tha
 The association of negative people and negative thinking had created such a trap of sadness around him that he did not get success anywhere
 usne mujhase poocha ki main itnaa khush kyon rahata hum? maine use bataaya ki vah nakaaratmak chintan main jitna samay lagaataa he utana hi samay main sakaaratmak chintan main lagaataa hum
 i told him what the benefits of positive thinking can be
 parivaar main kisi kii maut, talaak va naukari khona aadi jivan ke tathy hai, jinhen aap badal nahin sakate, lekin aap in halaat se nikalne kaa koi tarika khoj sakate hai
 Some people make their lives painful by wearing a cloak of seriousness
 kuch bhi gambhirthapurvak na sochen or apni himmat banaaen rakhen
 i was married on January 19, 1966, most of the people in the procession were from the countryside
 ve log chandigarh dekhne ke laalach se saath aa gaye ki duulhe ko chhodkar chandigarh dekhne chale jaaenge
 To some people, this thing went awry, but i did not take it seriously and it made me laugh
 aise hi bure or udhaas maukon par aapaki hansi kaam aati he
 During stress, concentrate on such fun things that are part of your life
 hamaara sara astitv itnaa ubaau or kaam ke boj se bharaa he ki ham keval yahi sochate hai ki hamaare saath kya bura ho rahaa he? aise main ham choti-choti baton kii tarif karnaa tak bhul jate hai
 Our positivity is lost somewhere between a bad boss or colleagues
 aise halaat main sabase pehle apana kaam khatm karen or phir un baton par dhyaan den jo jivan main aapke liye myne rakhti hai

 yojana kaa shubharambh karte hue piem modi ne kaha ki is yojana kaa aankalan bhavishya main maanavtaa kii bahut badi seva ke rup main hona tay he
 He said that some people are calling it Modi Care, and some people are calling it a scheme for the poor
 lekin mere liye yah 'daridr narayan' kii seva he
 The PM said that more Indians are going to get the benefit of this scheme together, including the population of European Union, USA, Canada and Mexico

 patr main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki apurva ko isliye fansaaya gaya hoga kyonki tiwari parivaar use apni jaaydaad main koi hissaa nahin dena chahta

 Police said that Apurva went to the room several times after killing Tiwari at around one o'clock in the night, then the possibility of tampering with the scene is very high

 According to him, Apoorva strangled Tiwari with his hands and then used a pillow so that he could not shout for help

 ' itnaa hi nahin, kejariwal ke bhartiya janata party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa
 The Delhi Chief Minister alleged that the CBI reports directly to Amit Shah
 kejariwal ne likhaa, 'main poochna chahta hum ki vah bataaen, jis maamle main sibiai manish sisodiya or satyendra jain ke khilaaf jaanch kar rahi he un cese main ab tak kya hua

 arapy singh kaa aarope he ki arvind kejariwal desh ke pehle aise setting mukhyamantri hai jinke khilaaf ghotaalon main sidhe sidhe FIR darj he
 RP Singh questioned that Kejriwal always talks about transparency
 aise main jab unke khilaaf jaanch chal rahi he to vah use badale kii bhaavana kii karrwai kyon qaraar de rahe hai jabaki khud unke hi purv mantri kapil mishra ne unke khilaaf gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 Earlier on Saturday, CBI and Anti Corruption Branch went to the offices of Delhi Jal Board to inquire about which Kejriwal attacked PM Modi directly and said that Prime Minister Modi's CBI and Lt

 In such a situation, the Congress is adopting every tactic so that the credibility of the party can be restored
 punjab chunaavon main captain amarinder singh kii aguwai main party ne jeet hasil kii he
 The Congress also wants to take advantage of the spectacular performance in the Punjab elections in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi elections
 isliye party punjab kii jeet ke nayak rahe mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ko dilli nagar nigam chunaav main prachaar ke liye laane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 According to Congress sources, Captain Amarinder will address 6 road shows and public meetings in the month of April and will work to connect Sikh and Punjabi society with the party
 tippaniyan a Delhi Congress spokesperson said that the Delhi Congress team had gone to Punjab polls to open Kejriwal's poll, so the Punjab unit would also come to Delhi to campaign
 captain singh kai siton par yahaan prachaar karne aaenge
 Let us tell you that a considerable population of Delhi is of the people of Punjabi and Sikh society
 pashchimi dilli kii tilak nagar, hari nagar, rajouri garden, moti nagar, nai dilli kii patel nagar, karol baag, rajinder nagar samet kareeb darjan bhar vidhansabha siton main sikh or punjabi voter badi sankhya main hai

 It is not easy to keep the Indian audience always seeking success from their players
 bhartiya team ke vishwa cap khitaab bachaa paane par to daanv lagane vaale na ke baraabar hai, lekin vishwa cap ke apane pehle match main pakistan ke khilaaf bhartiya team kii jeet lagbhag sabhi tay maan rahe hai
 India and Pakistan will open their respective World Cup campaigns against each other at the Adelaide Oval on Sunday
 apane pehle match kii purv sandhya par bhartiya team ke captain mahendra singh dhoni ne apane prashansakon ko aashwaasan dete hue kaha ki unki team ke khilaadi is match ke dabaav ke jhelane kii kshamta rakhte hai
 Dhoni said that the players of the Indian team are not restless about this match, but they are very restrained and have the experience of facing the pressure of big matches
 dhoni kaa tark he ki indian premier lig (ipel) ke behad dabaav vaale tathaa khachaakhach bhare stadium main khilne se unki team kii vishwa cap kii acchhee taiyaari hui he
 But Dhoni may have forgotten that in tournaments like the World Cup, not the ability to bear the pressure, but the ability to put pressure on the opposition team gives success
 mejabaan newjiland or australia ne dikhaa diya he ki kaise vipakshi team ko ballebaaji ke bal par match se baahar kar diya jaataa he
 It would be a coincidence that both hosts New Zealand and Australia were invited by their opposition teams to bat first after winning the toss
 or donon hi tiimon ne shuruaati power play kii samaapti tak apekshit shuruyaat hasil kar lee
 During the World Cup 23 years ago in the Australian continent, the Indian team was successful in defending their 216 runs score against Pakistan and bowled Pakistan at 173
 lekin vah daur aisa tha jab 220 se adhik kaa score acha mana jaataa tha
 Dhoni may prefer to bowl first against Pakistan, so that his ineffective bowling attack takes advantage of the fresh pitch
 lekin aisi sthiti main duusari pari main edilade ovel kii pich spin gendbaajon ke liye madadgaar sabit ho sakati he
 The performance of the Indian team in Australia since November last year cannot be said to be favorable for the preparation of the World Cup, but India may not get a better program than this in the World Cup
 kuch khel visheshgyon kaa to yahaan tak kahana he ki vishwa cap kaa praaroop isliye aisa rakhaa gaya he, taaki bharat toornament main adhik se adhik samay tak pratispardhaa main bana rahe
 And perhaps even the International Cricket Council (ICC) does not want the Indian team to be out before the knockout
 bharat ke liye pakistan ke khilaaf pehla match kai myanon main behad ahm he, kyonki jeet milane par bharat kii nokout main pravesh kaaphi had tak tay ho jaaegi
 After this, India will have to win only two matches to save the title
 bharat kii jeet in sawaalon par kaaphi had tak nirbhar karegi :- - Will Indian bowling be able to return to the track in the International ODI after a poor performance in Test matches? - match jitau gendbaajon ke abhaav main kya ballebaaji kharaab gendbaaji kii bharpai kar paaenge? Will Indian fielding be able to break out of the image of its old days? - kya bhartiya team dhauni ke saath us had tak kadamtal karne ko utsuk he, jaisi pichhali baar sachin tendulkar ke saath thi? - And finally, will Captain Dhoni be able to be a source of inspiration for his team in the same way as last time? bharat ke saath bade tanaav ke bich pakistani vayusena pramukh ne chetavanee di ki unke suraksha bal dushman ke kisi bhi akraman kaa is tarah se jawaab denge ki uski aane vaali peediyaan ise yaad rakhengi

 oobad-khabad sadakon se gujarata-thahartaa banaras
 Banaras settled on a pile of garbage like mountains
 ghanton jam se jujhataa banaras
 These days the city is buzzing with election discussions
 narendra modi kii ummidavaari or pichley kareeb ek maheene se deraa jamaaye arvind kejariwal kii maujuudagi ne banaras ke chunaav ko aan-baan or shaan kaa vishay bana diya he
 Otherwise, elections were held on the Banaras parliamentary seat in every Lok Sabha election, but this region did not become the center of the electoral battle
 media main lagaataar khabaren dikhaai ja rahi hai ki kaise banaras kii sadaken khashtahal hai
 How heaps of garbage are there pani main chlorine zyada he
 How Banaras is stuck in jam for many hours a day
 bilkul thik, aisa hi he banaras
 Some journalists also reached the village
 shahari banaras se yahaan kii tasviir or bhi zyada niraashajanak he
 Although villages across the country are in a bad state
 par kyonki banaras charchaa ke centre main he isliye yahaan zikr karnaa jaruri he
 Banaras railway station is a place, Raja Talab, just 17 kilometers from Cantt
 yah kshetra banaras kii sewapuri vidhansabha seat main aata he
 Here is a village in the block Arajilines, Mehdiganj
 yah do puravon main banta he
 Mehndiganj Mathai and Mehdiganj
 jiti road se bilkul laga hua he yah gaanv
 Barely three kilometers from the main road
 is gaanv main jane ke liye aapke paas apana vaahan hona chahie
 The entire village has a population of about ten thousand
 thakur, patel, miyaan, rajbhar, gadriya or musahar
 There are different settlements of these people in this village
 jaisaa ki zyaadaatar gaanvon main hota he
 Meaning different castes have different settlements within villages
 musahar jinhen daliton main bhi mahadalit mana jaataa he
 If you ask the way of their settlement, some people will call them Pasi and some people will call them moose eaters
 koi rasukhdaar thakur yaa miyaan mil jayega to jarur poochhega vahaan kisase milanaa he? jawaab dene se pehle aisa bhi bolegaa jarur media se honge
 There is an election
 poochhate-poochhate is basti main pahunchenge to saamne bajabajaati naaliyaan, gaddhedaar nal kii jagat main saalon se jamaa pani
 Looks bad par usase zyada aashcharya tab hota he jab mahaj aath se das kadam kii duuri par basii thakuron kii basti, jahaan ginakar chaar ghar hai, main saaf-safai or pakke khadnje najar aate hai
 While there are around three hundred houses in the Mushars colony
 duusari taraf hi miyaanon kii basti he
 There too the situation is not right like Thakur's colony but it is not so bad either
the traditional profession of Mushars who make patton ko todakar pattalen banane vaale musaharon kaa paramparaagat pesha eent ke bhatthon main kaam karnaa bhi he
 These people stay outside for about six to eight months in a year
 abhi ham kuch auraton se baat kar hi rahe the ki peeche se kareeb saath-pansth saal ke sohan aakar kehete hai
 Madam at least recommend the line
 dekhie na bagal main thakuron ke chaar ghar hai phir bhi line he
 There is also a line in the town of Mian
 patelon kii basti main bhi
 The line has not reached our colony just today
 chaaron taraf najar daudakar dekha to sach main vahaan koi taar nahin tha
 Has there ever been a line here, Chinguria, who is making a plate, asks
 kabhi nahin
 If you ask the head, what will you say about the line? If you say that, Mr
 President, children sit to study at night, then they say? Will you become a collector after studying? mjedaar baat yah he ki yah gaanv 2002 main ambedkar gram bhi ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 Despite this, the homes of Dalits could not be illuminated
 chaaron ore patel, thakuron, miyaanon, gadariyon kii basti main khambhe gade hai
 But this settlement has been left out
 dobaaraa poocha ki aap log sarkari daftar kyon nahin jate? jawaab pratyaashit hi tha
 Sir, the government is the head for us
 is basti or aas-paas kii basti ke fark ko bina kisi se kuch puche bhi aasaani se dekha ja saktaa he
 Amidst this sad story, who suddenly asked who would vote
 to jawaab kii jagah sawaal mila
 Who do you tell? Kamal's car had just arrived
 unke juluus main jane ke liye
 We were gone by one or two people
 par kya phayda, kisi ko bhi den vot
 Who will listen to Mushars? Asked if Pradhan ever comes to this colony
 jawaab mila, nahin! vah kaise hamaare daravaaje aaenge? ham jate hai
 But Prime Minister does not listen to anything
 ab jo sawaal poocha shaayad vah keval apni tasalli ke liye hi poocha tha maine, kyonki ab tak unka haal dekhakar andaja ho gaya tha ki jawaab kya milegaa? aap logon ko shaadi byaah main bulaate hai aasapaas ke log
 Yes, shoes go for picking leaves
 pattal to aap se hi kharidte honge yah log
 The answer was yes
 to kya aap ke chhue pattal main khaanaa khate hai
 Not only the whole village eats the entire Banaras
 bas hamaara chuaa nahin khate
 
 
 Saying this, an 18-19 year old boy got abused from his mouth
 gussa, khiz uski aawaaj main saaf the
 Tetra Devi sitting near and said angrily that even our touched Chamars do not eat
 kyonki ham dalit nahin mahadalit hai
 However, seeing the children coming from school, there was some comfort
 thakuron kii basti kareeb hi thi
 Four houses of counting
 saaf-suthri basti
 If you discussed the election with the well-known resident of the town, Daroga Singh, only Modi would speak
 baton hi baton main maine unase poocha ki musaharon kii basti itani gandi kyon he? line bhi nahin he? jawaab mila kya bataaen madam
 He likes darkness only
 kabhi koi koshish hi nahin karte
 We have never seen the line in this colony
 saath khadey unke bete rahul singh ne apane pita ke sur main sur milaate hue kaha, gandagi or inkaa to cholii-daaman kaa saath he
 When he went to Pradhan's house and asked him about the settlement of the Mushars, he also got the answer here that these people prefer darkness only
 jab jor dekar poocha ki kya kabhi aapane line ke bare main vibhaag main baat kii he to jawaab mila nahin, kabhi nahin
 Why? Madame lives in kilns for half a year, these people
 aakhir karenge kya line kaa? yahi haal banaras kii sari musahar bastiyon kaa he
 These are the Mushars who are considered Mahadalits
 lekin zyaadaatar gaanvon main daliton kii bastiyon kii haalat kareeb-kareeb aisi hi he
 This difference between forward and backward settlements is evident in the villages
 banaras main hi nahin balki uttar pradesh ke alag-alag jilon main yahi haal he
 As news is constantly appearing in the media that Narendra Modi can become the next Prime Minister of India, it will be a challenge for Modi, who will explain the development in such a situation, to link these Mahadalits with the mainstream of development
 dekhnaa hoga ki modi ke vikaas kii torch kii roshni in mahadaliton par bhi padati he yaa chhitakkar sirf samaaj ke majboot tabakon ko hi roshan karegi

 " desh main daal ke badhate daamon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue maharashtra bhar main vyapaariyon ke godaamon par chaape maare ja rahe hai
 Claiming to take strict action against hoarders, the government has spoken of imposing MCOCA on these hoarders
 daal ke daam jab aasmaan chhu rahe hai tab vyapaariyon ke godaamon par chaape padane shuru hue hai
 Millions of lentils have started to be seized
 chaape daalane ke liye baqayada police kii madad lee ja rahi he
 The police have been told that they should put the intelligence department to investigate dal hoarders
 ab maharashtra control of organijd krime yani macoka kanoon ke tahat bhi daal vyapaariyon par karrwai hogi
 Girish Bapat, Minister of Food and Civil Supplies, says that the amount of goods seized is very high and such hoarding can only be done in an organized and thoughtful manner
 isliye macoka lagaaya jayega
 The announcement of imposing MCOCA on hoarders has been announced, but if the experts believe it will not be so easy
 tippaniyan Advocate Aniket Nikam said that to establish MCOCA, one has to show confidence
 ek orgenised krime sindicket dikhaanaa hoga
 There should be two chargesheets filed against at least one man of the syndicate in the same case within 10 years
 court uskaa cognizans legaa tabhi macoka lagegaa
 On the other hand traders are saying that they are not involved in any hoarding

 Padmavati: Jim took 70 lakhs, know controversies about Deepika, Shahid, Ranveer's Feesnimboda, and the song was very popular
 isamen aishwarya raay bachchan ne kamaal kaa dance kiya tha
 In the film based on the love triangle, Salman Khan, Ajay Devgan acted opposite Aishwarya
 film main nimboda gane ke istemaal par vivaad bhi saamne aayaa tha
 Folk singers of Rajasthan objected to the film's use of the folk song, even terming it a theft
 ghumar ke saath prayog kii vajah se bhansaali kii aalochana ho sakati he
 # Padmavati: So the trailer that came at 13:03 PM, neither Raja nor Rani Chhaya Khiljikya hai Ghoomar Dance? It is a collective folk dance of Rajasthan

 These dances are performed at three to four bands, among which Chirmi Mhari Chirmi Ghoomar, Mharo Gorband Nakhralas, Ghoomar is the chief
 jaipur main jahaan dance kaaphi prachlit he he, vahaan iske liye 'assi kali' kaa ghaghara prasidd he
 New debate on Padmavati: Is there a glorification of the Jauhar tradition in the film? Ghoomar's history Although this collective dance originated from among the tribals but later became the domestic dance of the princely states
 kaha jaataa he ki amer main bhil-minaa jaisi jatiyon kaa kabja tha
 The Kachwaha Rajputs removed them and captured Amber

 There is also a Ghoomar dance among them

 The half-century innings of Shane Watson and Michael Clarke and the fine bowling of Mitchell Johnson enabled the previous three-time champions Australia to start their campaign to win the fifth World Cup by defeating Zimbabwe by 91 runs
 watasan ne 79 ran banaae jiske liye unhone 92 gend kheli tathaa aath chauke or ek chakka lagaaya
 Clarke remained unbeaten on 58 off 55 balls with the help of four fours
 in donon ke alaava bread hadine (29) or captain riki ponting (28) ne bhi yogadan diya jisase australia toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karte hue chah wicket par 262 ran kaa chunauteepurn score khadaa karne main safal rahaa
 Zimbabwe continued to struggle after losing four wickets in the beginning but despite that their team was 46
 2 over main 171 ran par simat gai or is tarah se haar kaa antar hi kam kar pai
 Zimbabwe's number nine batsman Graeme Kramer scored the highest 37 runs
 australia kii taraf se janson ne 19 ran dekar chaar jabaki shaan tait or jaisan kreja ne do-do wicket liye
 Australia's victory may have looked easy, but their batsmen faced a lot of problems in front of the spinners, while their other bowlers, except Johnson, could not leave their full impact on the less experienced Zimbabwe players

 One thing is clear from the material found with the terrorists that the terrorists had come with complete plans
 wo har sthiti se nipatane ke liye taiyaar the
 But even before wearing their plans, the security agencies revealed the dangerous game of terrorists
 lekin khatra abhi tala nahin he, kyonki faraar kuch aatankiyon ko abhi bhi koi ata-pataa nahin he or unki talash jari he
 The agencies are continuously raiding the terrorists

 The PDP-BJP coalition government has been formed in Jammu and Kashmir
 shapath grahan ke baad se hi donon dalon ke bichmanmutav kii khabarembhi aane lagi hai
 Although both parties are also talking about getting everything right in this regard, it is said that the bjp's first choice to form a government in the state was the National Conference rather than the PDP
 angreji akhbaar, 'indian express' kii khabar ke mutabik, sarkaar banane ke liye pidipi se sampark saadhane se pehle bijepi ne neshnal conference ke kaaryakari adhyaksh or rajya ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri umr abdulla se mulaakaat kii thi
 On December 24, a day after the state election results came, BJP president Amit Shah and the party's national general secretary Ram Madhav met Omar Abdullah in Delhi to discuss the possibility of an alliance
 akhbaar ne sutron ke hawaale se daawa kiya he ki bijepi kii ore se umr abdulla ko centre main cabinet mantri or rajya kii nai sarkaar main unki party ke kisi netaa ko up-mukhyamantri kaa pad die jane kaa ofer diya gaya tha
 Pointing out about this secret meeting, a picture has also been pointed out, which Omar Abdullah posted on Twitter on 24 December
 is tasviir main likhaa tha, 'shant rahiye, kyonki main vaapasi karuunga
 He is said to have met Amit Shah and Ram Madhav on the same night
 bijepi or neshnal conference ke sutron ne is mulaakaat ke bare main pushti bhi kii he
 However, different opinions are coming about what happened after the meeting and why the matter did not proceed
 neshnal conference ke ek netaa ne kaha ki bijepi kaa ofer do purvanumaanon par aadhaarit the
 He said, 'he was not comfortable with PDP politics
 ensi ko kam siten ai thim to bijepi ko laga ki vah apni marji chalaa legaa
 But Omar did not approve of it
 ' ensi sutron ne bataaya ki bijepi ne farukh abdulla se mulaakaat ke liye apane logon ko do baar landan bhejkar umr ko bypass karne kii bhi koshish kii thi
 On the other hand, Umardusi was immature, BJP sources said that Farooq Abdullah was fine for the alliance, but Omar seemed immature in this case
 bijepi ke ek netaa ne kaha, 'umr ko laga ki jab bijepi kii pidipi se baat nahin banegi to uske paas koi vikalp nahin hoga or vah umr ko dobaaraa siem pad ofer karegi
 'significantly, on the second day of this meeting i
e
 25 December, Ram Madhav tried to refute the news related to it
 unhone tab twitor par likhaa, 'dilli main ensi netaaon se bijepi netaaon kii mulaakaat kii khabar aadharahin he
 'umar also quickly retweet it
 ab ensi ke sutron kaa daawa he ki bijepi ne jammu-kashmir kii swaittata, afsapa or dhara-370 jaise ahm masalon par aage badhane main ruchi nahin dikhaai
 While BJP sources say, 'nc's initial response was quite positive
 lekin baatcheet ke baad hamen laga ki umr main vishwaas kaa abhaav he

 The Delhi Police has asked Constable Santosh Tomar to appear before the police after a contradiction in the post-mortem report and the statement of the Medical Superintendent of Ram Manoharlohia Hospital
 ek varisht police adhikari ne kaha ki unhone dow tii es siddhu ko notice jari kar unase tomars ke sabhi medical record ke saath pesh hone ko kaha he
 Tomar died on Tuesday
 vah 23 varshiya paramedical chaatra se balaatkaar kii ghatana ke baad india get par ho rahe virodh pradarshnon ke dauraan ravivaar ko ghayal ho gayi the
 Controversy has arisen over the reasons for Tomar's death
 do chashmadidon ne police ke is daawey ke vipareet bayaan diya he ki unka nidhan hinsa main ai choton ke kaaran hua he
 Sidhu also said that there were no major external injuries or deep internal injuries except for some bruises and scratches on Tomar's body
 haalanki postmortem report ke anusaar 47 saal ke tomars kaa nidhan unke seene or gardan main lagi choton ke chalate aaye dil ke daure ke kaaran ho gaya
 The incident of rape with a 23-year-old girl in the capital is showing that socially we are moving towards a downfall where every man is living in his carved
 jo uske man ne chaha use chahie-car, paisa yaa aurat
 If this is not achieved in a legitimate way, then it is right in an illegitimate way
 yah ek aisa samaaj he jahaan kisi ko galat kaam karne se dar nahin lagata or maano hamaare desh main sabhi staron par sabhi kaam kuch aisi hi pravriti ke saath kiye ja rahe hai
 Walking through the corridors of politics and the corporate world, Surma believes that he will rob us - through the scams of thousands of crores
 agar aap samaaj ke us tabake se hai jin becharon ke paas utana bada haath maarane kii aukaat nahin, to car churaaenge, ghar main ghus kar chori kar lenge or sabase badhkar mardaangi karenge ki aurat kii aabru lut lenge or jab tak kanoon kaa shikanja aap par kasega, aap nau do gyaarah ho lenge
 As if there is no contact between the political system and those who run it
 insaaf ke liye guhaar lagaai ja rahi he or puri tarah kaan band kiye hue vyavastha kii kachua chaal se pratikriya gusse ko badhaane kaa kaam karti he
 The irony is that a handful of people silence a lot of people
 maine kuch logon ko kehete suna ki ye kam padhe-likhe logon kii jamaat he jinke paas kaam nahin, us par aarthik str par bad rahaa antar unhen kunthit bana rahaa he, shaayad vahi ghrunit kaam ke liye unhen uksaa detaa he
 This may or may not happen

 Of course there is something wrong in the society only then the man here thinks that he will escape even after sexual harassment or rape of the woman
 film nirmaataa hone ke naate main aksar sochataa hum ki jis industry kaa main hissaa hum, kahin vah bhi to aanshik taur par aisi ghatnaon ke liye jimmedaar soch ko badhaava dene ke liye jimmedaar nahin
 i regret to say that the answer is yes
 aisi bhi filmein hai jinamein heroinon ko lubhaane ke liye pyaar bhari sharaarton ne utpeeda kaa rup akhriyaar kar liya he
 These films would be called Shoda in some civilized societies
 sochie jaraa, vah hero lakhon logon kaa role model he
 
 
 Obviously, his fans will not understand what is wrong with such activities
 Now imagine that this heroine is also a role model for millions
 
 
 to desh bhar kii ladakiyon main koun-sa sandesh jayega? ek samay tha jab villen heroin ko tang karata tha to hero uski jamkar pitayee karata tha
 Today the hero is harassing the heroine and surprisingly, the story ends with his marriage to the same hero who is harassing him
 isliye jarurat is baat kii he ki lekhak, nirdeshak or nirmaataa is par gambhirtha se vichaar karen
 a woman has every right to decide with whom she is bedridden, when she is and enjoy those personal moments to the fullest
 unhen kyon kaha jaataa he ki ve mobile na le jaaen, genes na pahanen, yaa ladakon ke saath meljol na karen? jo log yah kehete hai ki ladakiyon / mahilaon ko andhera hone ke baad baahar nahin nikalnaa chahie, kyonki samay acha nahin, unase main kahana chaahunga ki kya acha ho ki shaam hote hi mardon kaa baahar nikalnaa band kar diya jaae? kya yah auraton ke liye zyada surakshit upaay nahin?main bas itihaas ke darichon se stri or uske sharir ko apane niyantran main rakhane kii mardon kii granthi ko padhuya chahta hum or meri samaj main yahi aata he ki aurat ke andar srijan kii alokik kshamta ke kaaran vah itani shaktisampann najar aati he ki uske saamne khud ko bouna mahasoos karte mard kii baukhalaahat use kunthit kar detii he
 Today women have proved that they can play the role of men's boss in the office, run companies, run the government and know how many jobs they can do
 mard dar gaya he
 Now the last resort he has left is to physically target him
 isse vah yah mahasoos karata he ki aaj bhi vah us par raaj karata he
 But there is a trick to counter it
 hamaare mantri, police vibhaag or hamaari nyaaypalika ko ekajute hona hoga
 We have to create a strong civil lobby which demands a fast track court, amends the law and it should be implemented as soon as possible
 chahen ve guwahati ke badmijaaj hon, mumbai main meri dost or sahakarmi pallavi ke hatyare hon, dilli ke balaatkaari hon yaa desh ke kisi kone main baitha acid phenkane vaala, ab tak kisi ko bhi is tarah kii sajaa nahin mili ki agali baar galat kadam uthaane se pehle unki ruh kaanp uthe
 When there is no immediate punishment for any crime committed, there is no fear of it
 yahi kaaran he ki aaj vandhyakaran (castrishan) or maut kii sajaa dene ke liye aawaaj uth rahi he
 Society is boiling
 log belgaum ho jaaen usase pehle prashasan ko apana kaam shuru kar dena chahie or jab tak aisa nahin hota, yah gussa thamane vaala nahin; hindustani aurat kii pidaa thamane vaali nahin or in sabake liye ham jimmedaar honge
 So whatever you want to do, do it today
 farhaan akhtar actor, lekhak, nirdeshak, nirmaataa or do betiyon ke pita hai

 Now in the year 2017, he has made a Hindi remake of this film under the name 'poster Boys'
 film main sani deol or bobi deol ko ek saath bade parade par dekhne kaa majaa bhi aap le sakate hai
 But it remains to be seen whether this film will live up to the audience's standards? The story of this film is from a village in Haryana
 sarkaar kii ek galati ke kaaran is gaanv ke teen aadamiyon kii tasviir (sanni deol, bobi deol or shreyas talapade) nasbandi se jude ek poster par chap jaati he
 Here, all kinds of problems arise in the lives of the three

 The dialogues of old films Sunny Deolki have been used more
 samvaad or behatar kiye jate, to majaa aata
 The film's music and background score are also weak
 kyon dekhensoni deol , bobi deol , shreyas talapade kii umdaa acting or parfect comic timming ke liye
 Bobby Deol has been missing for a long time, so he can watch the film for his different avatar
 box offispramotion ke saath film kaa bajet 15 karod rupee bataaya ja rahaa he
 The film is releasing on about 1000 screens

 JDU Secretary General KC Tyagi held a press conference in Delhi on Monday, claiming that there was misleading propaganda by the Sharad Yadav camp that the party had split
 unhone kaha ki ikkaa-dukka logon ke jane se party main vibhaajan nahin hota
 Although KC Tyagi himself admitted that Sharad Yadav has not been expelled from the party yet, but due to anti-party activities, he himself has turned away from the party

 kasee tyaagi ne kaha ki ali anwar ko chhodkar koi bhi saansad sharad yadav ke saath nahin he
 Regarding Kerala's JDU leader Virender Kumar, he claimed that he was splitting from the party but neither with Nitish Kumar nor with Sharad Yadav

 jediu ke varisht netaa or bihar ke purv mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne narendra modi sarkaar par ek baar phir bhadak gaye hai
 This time his anger is over not fulfilling the promise made to farmers for one and a half times the price of the crop
 unka kahana he ki vaada puraa karne ke bajaay rajyon ko bonus nahin dene kii dhamkee di ja rahi he
 Addressing the JDU activists in Banka during his 'sampark Yatra', his party workers were listening to an audio tape by Modi promising to pay farmers one and a half times the minimum support price they would get for their crops during the Lok Sabha elections
 Asked what happened to that promise? He said that at present only 3 in the minimum support price as compared to the previous year
 5 fisadi kii vruddhi kii gai he
 Nitish, while reading a warning letter written to him by the Union Food and Consumer Minister on the announcement of additional bonus of Minimum Support Price of States last June, said that the announcement of additional bonus of Minimum Support Price has a negative impact on the market and Traders are facing difficulties
 nitish ne centre ke us patr ko uddhrit karte hue kaha ki centre ne dhamkee di he ki agar rajyon dwaara nunatam samarthan mulya ke atirikt bonus diya gaya to vah varsh 2014-15 ke rabi or kharif mausam ke dauraan bhartiya khaadya nigam ke jariye anaaj uthaav ko simit kar degaa
 Nitish said that the letter said that in the event of giving bonus, take up the responsibility of disposal of more food grains, which shows the bjp-led NDA government is 'anti-farmer'
 gat 13 november se ‘sampark yatra’ par nikle nitish ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ke vaade ke baavjood bijepi sarkaar kalaadhan ko waapas laane, nunatam samarthan mulya or bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja nahin de rahi he
 On the other hand, Union Food and Public Distribution Minister Ram Vilas Paswan dismissed Nitish's charge that it seems that he has been misinformed about the new foodgrain policy of the Center or he is deliberately spreading lies to hide his mistakes
 
 rajyon ko bonus die jane par koi pratibandh nahin lagaaya gaya he
 Paswan said that Bihar is not a surplus state in terms of availability of food grains
 bihar ko prativarsh 49 lakh ton anaaj kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, lekin vah maatr das lakh ton hi anaaj kharid paata he or baaki anaaj punjab or haryana se vahaan bheja jaataa he

 It was a difficult time for Moshe
 
 
 lekin uski jindagi main ab ek or bada mauka aane vaala he
 Moshe is now ten years old and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called him to meet him
 pradhanmantri narendra modi 4 july se isroyal ke daure par ja rahe hai, jahaan yerusalem main moshe unase milegaa
 Moshe's family said, "we have partners in our sorrow
 It is an emotional moment for Bhartiya Mosh's grandparents and her caretaker Bhartiya Naini (aya)
" moshe ke parivaar ne kaha ki bhartiya pradhanmantri ke nyaute se mahasoos hua he ki bhartiya bhi hamaare dukh main saajheedaar hai or ve hamen bhuule nahin hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also meet Moshe's Indian nanny Sandra Samuels
 nariman house main aatanki hamale ke dauraan sandra ne moshe ko bachaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Sandra escaped from Nariman House with Moshe and her grandparents Simeon and Yehudit Rosenberg
 bhartiya ucchayukta ne phone kar diya nyautashimon rosburg ne pitiai se kaha ki jab hamen bhartiya ucchayukta kii ore se phone aayaa, to mujhe apane kaanon par vishwaas nahin hua ki pradhanmantri narendra modi hamase milanaa chaahate hai
 My first reaction was that Indians have not forgotten us and are partners in our misery
 rocenberg ne aage kaha ki bhartiya pradhanmantri ke bulaave se milane vaali anubhuti ko bataa paanaa sambhav nahin he
 We are looking forward to this opportunity
 mumbai main hoga moshe kaa baar mitjahmoshe ke dada se jab poocha gadha ki bhartiya pradhanmantri se milane par ve unase kya kahenge, to rocenberg ne kaha ki ham apane pote kaa mumbai main baar mitjah karnaa chaahate hai or iske liye pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bulaanaa chaahate hai
 Bar Mitzah is in a way similar to the Upanayan rite of Israeli children at the age of 13
 rocenberg ne kaha ki hamen mahasoos hota he ki mumbai main hamaara ghar he or vahaan parivaar bhi he
 We want to do Moshe's Bar Mitzah in Mumbai in the next two and a half years and want Prime Minister Narendra Modi to come to the event
 mumbai hamale main maare gaye moshe ke maa-bapmose kii maa rivaka or pita gevrial holtjberg mumbai ke chabad house main doot ke rup main kaam karte the
 During the Mumbai attack, 6 people including Rewka and Gavriel were killed by let militants who entered Nariman House
 2008 main hue mumbai hamale main 166 log maare gaye the
 Nariman House, popularly known as Chabad House, was one of the five places where terrorists attacked
 bhartiya aayaa sandra ke saath he moshe kaa khaas lagaavamoshe ab 10 saal kaa ho gaya he or dharmik skool yeshiva jaataa he
 Moshe has a lot of affection with his wife Aya Sandra, who works in Jerusalem and visits Moshe's family at the end of the week
 moshe ke dada ne bataaya ki sandra ko dekhakar vah bahut khush ho jaataa he or puure weekend par uske saath kheltaa rahata he
 Sandra has received citizenship of Israel and Sandra risked her life to save her grandparents
 sitambar 2010 main sandra ko isroyal kii maanad naagarikta se sammanit kiya gaya
 Throughout the week, Sandra works with Israeli children and moves to Northern Israel on weekends to spend time with Moshe's family
 haalanki pradhanmantri narendra modi or moshe kii mulaakaat kaa vakt or jagah tay nahin he, lekin iske yerusalem main hi hone kii ummid he

 the best memories! Former 'TRAI' chairman Pradeep Baijal has accused the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the 2G scam case
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri ne unhen sahyog na karne par 'nuksaan' uthaane kii baat kahi thi
 In his book, Baijal has written that the allegations of UPA-2 nekhud to tarnish someone else's head were tarnished
 gauratlab he ki adhikariyon ne is cese main baijal kii bhoomika kii bhi lambey samay tak jaanch kii thi
 The English newspaper 'times of India' reported this
 baijal ke mutabik, 'mere jaise beurocret kii sthiti aisi thi ki 'kuch karo to afat' or 'na karo to afat'
 i warned many people involved in UPA-2 that the investigation against me and other officials could eventually go to the Prime Minister as he was the one who approved the decisions of all ministers and ministries
 dayaanidhi maaran, e raja or koyala mantri ke kaamon ko unhone hi hari jhandi di thi aurasieji ne jo nuksaan rajkosh ko bataaya he, usamen vah bhi baraabar ke doshi hai
 Baijal made these claims in his book 'the Complete Story of Indian Reforms: 2G, Power and Private Enterprise - a Practitioner's Diary'
 'samasyaayein kaise shuru huin' naam ke ek chapter main baijal ne daawa kiya he, 'maine 2004 main dayaanidhi maaran ko telecom mantri banaae jane par PM manmohan singh se apni ashanka jataai thi
 Because it was a matter of conflict of interest
 maaran ek broadcaster the or 2004 main hi broadcast regular ke rup main tri kaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 But according to Baijal, Manmohan Singh dismissed his concerns saying that this is not a matter of conflict of interest as TRAI is an independent regulator and separate ministry of information and broadcasting and telecom
 baijal ne manmohan singh ko us vakt kaa 'pradhanmantri, telecom' tak kaha he
 According to him, Manmohan used to take all decisions related to telecom
 baijal ke mutabik, 'unhone kaha ki agar main unke nirdesh nahin maanoonga to mujhe baari nuksaan uthaanaa padegaa
 His words proved to be right because i have suffered a lot since then

 In such a situation, Kejriwal has resigned after writing a letter
 rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main kejariwal ke alaava 20 sadsy hai, jo ab is babat voting ke jariye faisla karenge
 The reason for the resignation is that Kejriwal has said that he is also the Chief Minister of Delhi and his busy in administrative work has increased, hence he wants to give all his time to the state
 kejariwal ne kaha ki vah party ko samay nahin de paa rahe hai isliye unke istife ko sweekaar kiya jaae
 Reacting to the resignation, Yogendra Yadav, who has been accused of plotting to remove Airwind Kejriwal from the post of national convenor, said that this is not new
 party ke andar sab thik he
 Kejriwal has also offered to resign earlier due to his preoccupation
 haalanki antim faisla rashtriya kaaryakarini ko lenaa he
 Yadav said that he wished that Arvind should hold the post of Convenor of the party
