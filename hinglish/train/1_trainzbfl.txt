 chaatra or aaropee donon hi us vakt civil services kii taiyaariyon ke liye ek hi koching main saath padhate the

 Binny said, "today i am writing a letter to Lt Governor Najeeb Jung to inform him of my decision to withdraw support from Kejriwal government
" vah (kejariwal) sirf dilli ke logon ko hi jhooth bolkar dhokhaa nahin de rahe, balki sabhi deshavaasiyon se jhooth bol rahe hai or unhen dhokhaa de rahe hai
 He, however, said that he would support the government on the Jan Lokpal issue
 binni ne kaha, yadi sarkaar vidhansabha main anna (hajaare) kaa janalokapal vidheyak laati he to main uskaa samarthan karuunga
 Binny, who has been expelled by the AAP, has placed several demands before the Delhi government, including fulfilling the promises made before the assembly elections
 apane saath paanch vidhayakon ke samarthan kaa daawa karte hue binni ne ravivaar ko dhamkee di thi ki yadi unki maangen 48 ghante ke bheetar puri nahin hotin to vah sarkaar gira denge
 He asked the government to address the issues related to electricity and water sector
 unhone maang kii thi kii sarkaar bijli ke daamon main kii gai 8 pratishat kii vruddhi par logon ko sabsidi pradaan kare 
 The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) had increased the electricity prices by 6 to 8 percent this month
 unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki ‘sarkaar ko mahilaon kii suraksha ko praathamikta dete hue vaayade ke anusaar, mahila daste banane chahie
 Instead of charging the entire water for using more water than the prescribed limit, only that water should be charged, which has cost extra than 700 liters
 binni ne yah bhi kaha tha ki vah aap ke do anya vidhayakon or nigam pashardon ke saath ek raajnneetik morcha banaaenge haalanki do vidhayakon ikbaal or shaukeen ne you turn lete hue kaha ki ve apni dhamkee par ab amal nahin karenge
 Both the mlas had said that they changed their minds after meeting with Kejriwal and claimed that Binny too has agreed not to withdraw support from the AAP government
 pashchim bengal main ek nan se rape ke baad rajya main kathith rup se ek sadhvi ke saath bhi aisi ghatana saamne ai he
 When both the issues were raised in the Lok Sabha on Thursday, there was such an altercation among the members of BJP and Trinamool Congress that President Sumitra Mahajan asked if they should give both of them in their hands

 Raising the issue, Ahluwalia said that the noise of the rape incident with a 71-year-old nun in West Bengal had not cooled down to the fact that a 75-year-old sadhvi had been raped and murdered in Katwa in Burdwan district of the state
 unhone kaha ki in ghatnaon ko dekhte hue rajya kii mahila mukhyamantri ko apane pad se istipha dena chahie
 Kalyan Banerjee of the Trinamool Congress strongly opposed this, claiming that it was not a case of murder but of rape and the post-mortem report has confirmed this
 is par aahalwalia or banerjee ke bich der tak takaraar hoti rahi
 Both of them kept raising their hands towards each other and charged

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is an optimistic person
 ek bhaashan main unhone kaha tha ki har vyakti kaa apana najariya hota he or apane najariye se hi duniya ko dekhtaa he

 Ishwadi, but trust in karma: In an interview, PM Narendra Modi said that i am an Godist
 main ashaavadi hum or param shakti main vishwaas rakhata hum
 But i agree that i should not bother him
 mujhe jis kaam ke liye usne bheja he, wo mujhe karnaa chahie
 Don't bother God again and again, do this for me
 log subah-shaam mandir jaakar ishwar ko kaam bataa dete hai ki mere liye ye karo, wo karo
 God is not our agent
 paramatma ne hamen bheja he, wo hamase jo karavaayega, hamen wo karnaa chahie
 One has to go on the path on the basis of the God who gives wisdom

 The dreaded terrorist organization Islamic State (ISIS) has made a sensational claim
 aies ne kaha ki vah bharat main pehali baar 'praant' sthapit karne main kaamyaab ho gaya he
 According to the report of the news agency Reuters, this claim has been made after an encounter in Kashmir between security forces and militants
 is muthbhed main ek aatankwaadi maaraa gaya, jiskaa sambandh isi group se tha
 The IS AMAC News Agency on Friday named the new province as the 'vilayah of Hind'
 bayaan main daawa kiya gaya ki kashmir ke shopiyaan jile ke amashipora main aies ne bhartiya javaanon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya
 But a police spokesperson denied the claim
 haalanki aies ne mana ki shuukravaar ko ishfaq ahamed sophy naam kaa aatankwaadi encounter main maaraa gaya
 The is's claim of establishing a new province seems like standing again
 april main iraq or syria se aies kaa khalipha raaj khatm ho gaya tha, jahaan ek vakt hajaaron mile ke ilaake main uskaa shashan chalata tha
 Subsequent IS intensified suicide attacks
 haal hi main usne srilanka main kai jagah bam dhamaakon ko anjaam diya, jisamen 253 log maare gaye the
 "the establishment of a 'province' in an area where there is nothing like actual administration is absurd, but it should not be taken lightly," said Rita Katz, director of the SITE Intel Group, which monitors Islamic terrorists
 unhone kaha, "duniya in chizon par ankhen moond sakati he, lekin in kamjor kshetron main jihadiyon ke liye ye aies 'khalipha' ke nakshe ke punarnirmaan main jamini str par madad karne ke liye jaruri sanket hai
 "sophie, the terrorist killed in the encounter, had been working with several terrorist organizations in Kashmir for over a decade
 baad main vah islamic state main shaamil ho gaya
 This information was given by a military officer on Saturday
 iske alaava aies se sahanubhuti rakhane vaali srinagar kii ek magazine ko bhi sophy ne intervyuu diya tha
 According to sources, he was involved in several grenade attacks on security forces, police and army in the valley
 sainya adhikari ne kaha, mumkin he ki kashmir main sophy iklauta aatanki hi tha, jo aies se judaa tha
 Terrorists have been fighting the security forces in Kashmir for many decades
 lekin vah islamic state kii tarah nahin hai, jo duniya par khalipha raaj kaayam karnaa chahta he
 India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir and both countries reached the brink of war after 40 soldiers were martyred in Pulwama

 However, oxygen supply to the BRD Hospital in Gorakhpur was stopped
 ab sawaal ye he ki kya iske liye sirf wo company jimmedaar he jo aspataal ko oxigen supplai kar rahi thi? kyonki company kii daleel he ki chah maheene main bakaayaa 69 lakh tak ja puhancha tha
 They had to pay money to another company further, so the supply had to be stopped

 But the fact is that if the hospital administration had already read the letters related to the deficiencies of oxygen, then the situation would not have been so terrible
 ahospataal prashasanaki laaparvaahiyon par royaa hi ja saktaa he
 Pushpa Sales Pvt Ltd, a company supplying oxygen to the hospital, wrote a letter to the Principal of BRD Medical College on March 22, 2017, about five months ago
 company ne likhaa tha ki 28 farvari tak aspataal par company kaa bakaayaa 42,70,294 rupee kaa ho chukaa he
 According to the tender, there is also a rule to pay within 15 to 20 days of handing over the bill
 lekin rupee nahin mili hai, jabaki isse pehle bhi bhugtan ke liye kai baar patrachaar kiya gaya he
 The staff had also ignored the administration by reading the things written on the warnings
 aspataal ke karmchaariyon ne bhi aspataal prashasan ko 10 agast 2017 ko chitthee likhi thi
 By then the supply of oxygen was slowing down
 karmchaariyon ne is chitthee main unhen yaad dilaayaa ki aspataal main 3 agast ko hi oxigen khatm hone kii jaankaree bal rog vibhaag ke head ko de di gai thi
 Accordingly, the reading of oxygen is at 900, so that supply is possible only till night
 chitthee main likhaa ki oxigen saplir company ke bhi bagair bhugtan ke or supplai karne se manaa kar diya he
 This threatens not only the pediatrics department, but the lives of patients in the entire hospital

 Our government does not want to earn money from the fine amount
 ham chaahate hai ki log kanoon kaa paalan karen, un par jurmaana nahin hoga
 This will save people's lives

 ) aaj release hui he, dharma productions kii 'hansi to fansi', jiskaa nirdesan kiya he vineet mathew ne, or mukhya bhoomikaayen nibhaai hai pariniti chopra, siddharth malhotra, adaa sharma, manoj joshi or sharat saxena ne
 
 
 The story of 'hansi Toh Fansi' revolves around 'nikhil', ie Siddharth Malhotra and 'karishma', ie Ada Sharma, who not only loves each other, but their marriage has also been decided
 
 
 tabhi 'nikhil' kii mulaakaat hoti he, 'karishma' kii choti bahan 'mita', yani pariniti chopra se, jo apane parivaar se dur rahati he, or jiskaa naam bhi parivaar lenaa nahin chahta, kyonki log use thodaa-sa 'khiskaa hua' samajhate hai
 
 
 After this, you will have to watch the film to find out what 'nikhil' and 'mita' brings to 'turn and Twist', but i will tell you what is good in 'laughter To Fansy' and what is bad
 
 
 pehali chiz yah he ki 'hansi to fansi' ek romantic kamedi he, or isaki script or screenple ko bahut khubsuurati se rachaa gaya he, lekin kahin-kahin yah halki-phulki film draig karti hui mahasoos hoti he
 
 
 The characterization in the film is also well done, and each character has been carefully crafted, be it Parineeti Chopra's character, Ada Sharma's, or Manoj Joshi's
 
 
 so, casting ke liye ek baar phir phul marks casting diarector mukesh chhabda ko, jinhone kai aise abhinaytaon ko cast kiya, jo apane kirdaaron main ekadam tailor-maid lagate hai
 
 
 For example, Anil Mange, who plays the role of Nikhil, Siddharth Malhotra's relative
 
 
 vah na sirf aapako hansaate hai, balki hindi cinema ke rozmarra ke chehron se alag or zyaada asardaar dikhte hai
 
 
 Now acted
 
 
 pariniti chopra khubsuurati ke saath apana kirdaar nibhaati hai, or siddharth malhotra va adaa sharma ne bhi apane-apane kirdaaron ke saath nyaay kiya he
 
 
 It is important to mention here Manoj Joshi, who plays Parineeti's father
 
 
 kai seens main unhone behtareen parformens di he
 
 
 Sharat Saxena and other minor characters have also managed to leave an impact in 'laughter To Fansy'
 
 
 'hansi to fansi' main sichuational kamedi he, jo vakt-vakt par aapako muskuraane par majaboor karegi, vahiin kuch seens aapaki ankhen nam bhi karenge
 
 
 But for me, the main structure of the story does not work, because in the recent past we have seen many films where a boy and a girl fall in love with each other, and later they realize that it They do not have true love, and they are someone else with whom they will be happy
 
 
 so, is kaaran aap film kii shuruyaat main hi bhaanp lete hai ki film kii kahani kya hogi
 
 
 Just scripts, funny dialogues, interesting characters hold you and entertain you as well
 
 
 lekin aapako aisa nahin lagata, jaise aapane kuch nayaa dekha
 
 
 Talking about music, the song 'drama Queen'
 
 
 ' mujhe acha laga
 
 
 The treatment of the film is largely realistic, which i liked
 
 
 to kul milakar isane mujhe anterten to kiya, lekin kahani main kuch nayaapan hota to behatar hota
 
 
 Nevertheless the work of the new director is good
 
 
 so, meri taraf se film kii reating he - 3 star

 Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Friday tabled the triple talaq bill to get Muslim women out of triple talaq
 iske baad sadan main congress sahit vipakshi dalon ne hangaamaa shuru kar diya
 Opposing the triple talaq bill, MP from Hyderabad and President of AIMIM Asaduddin Owaisi said that it is anti-constitution and a violation of Articles 14 and 15
 modi sarkaar ko muslim mahilaon se hamadardi he to kerala kii hindu mahilaon se mohabbat kyon nahin? aakhir sabarimala par aapkaa rukh kya he?saansad asaduddin ovaisi ne teen talaak vidheyak par sawaal khadey karte hue kaha ki agar kisi gaiyr muslim ko cese main daalaa jaae to use 1 saal kii sajaa or musalmaan ko 3 saal kii sajaa
 Isn't this a violation of Articles 14 and 15? Only Muslim men will be punished by this bill
 aap muslim mahilaon ke hit main nahin hai balki aap un par boj daal rahe hai
 Owaisi said that it is clear from the Supreme Court's decision on triple talaq that if a person gives triple talaq at a time, the marriage will not break
 aise main bill main jo pravaadhan he, usase pati jail chalaa jayega or use 3 saal jail main rahanaa hoga
 In such a situation, who will give alimony to a Muslim woman? Will you give (the government)? Owaisi said that you have so much love for Muslim women
 kerala kii hindu mahilaon se mohabbat kyon nahin he
 Why are you against the decision of Sabarimala? It is going wrong
 asaduddin ovaisi ne ajtak se baatcheet karte hue kaha ki is bill se koi phayda nahin hoga balki muslim mahilaon ko nuksaan hoga
 This Bill is against the basic rights of our Constitution
 ovaisi ne kaha ki agar aap koi kanoon bana rahe hai to uske tahat rijnable clacification honi chahie
 At present, there are many other laws including domestic violence law which is quite powerful
 supreme court kaa faisla he, jisamen teen talaak ko radd kar diya gaya
 In such a situation, if someone divorces then the marriage will not be broken
 aise aap uskaa apradheekaran kar rahe hai
 Owaisi said that if a non-muslim leaves his wife, he will be sentenced to 1 year and a 3-year sentence to the Muslim, which is against the goods rights
 aapako bahumat mila he to samvidhan ke khilaaf kanoon thode bana denge
 It is my right that the government brings a bill and i think if it is not right then we can protest
 ovaisi se pehle congress netaa shashi tharur ne sadan main kaha ki main is bill ke pesh kiye jane kaa virodh karata hum
 He said that i do not support triple talaq, but am opposed to this bill
 tharur ne kaha, yah bill samvidhan ke khilaaf he, isamen civil or criminal kanoon ko mila diya gaya he
 He said that if it is a crime in the eyes of the government to leave a wife divorced, then why is it limited to the Muslim community only
 unhone kaha ki kyon na is kanoon ko sabhi samudaay ke liye lagu kiya janaa chahie
 It was said from the Congress that the government is not benefiting Muslim women through this bill, but only punishing Muslim men

 The needle of suspicion is going towards Mohammad Shahabuddin, a former RJD MP, in the murder of daily Indian journalist Rajdev Ranjan in Siwan
 shahabuddin jo philhal siwan jail main hai, ke liye ravivaar kaa din buree khabar vaala rahaa
 Chawni Singh, a shooter arrested in the murder of former Congress leader Shrikant Bharti, has increased his difficulties by accepting that Shahabuddin had given the contract to the murder

 Later elected as an Independent and then MP on BJP ticket

 He was murdered on the same station road in 2014 where Rajdev Ranjan was shot dead on Friday evening
 lekin shrikant kii hatya kaa maamla aparaadhiyon kii giraftaar na hone ke kaaran thande baste main chalaa gaya tha
 But after Chawni's arrest, the case came back to life and after his statement to the police on Sunday, the case would be revived in the coming days
 tippaniyan As far as the murder of Rajdev Ranjan is concerned, no arrests have been made so far, but after questioning Upendra Singh, close to Shahabuddin, the police feel that he was also murdered in the rivalry
 police ke anusaar hatya kaa sthaan railway stesan road he, jahaan par pehle bhi do hatya purv saansad ke ishaare par kathith rup se kii chuki hai
 Apart from this, the closure of the CCTV installed there two days in advance, all these are the reasons why suspicion is currently going on Shahabuddin

 Those close to Shahabuddin say that he is being implicated
 darasal unke virodhiyon ko maaloom he ki agle maheene rajyasabha yaa vidhaan parishad chunaavon main unki patni hina sahab ko lalu yadav kisi na kisi sadan main jarur bhejte
 But they are being denied this race by dragging in controversy

 According to the police, the place of killing is Railway Station Road, where earlier two murders were allegedly done at the behest of the former MP
 iske alaava vahaan par lage sisitivi kaa do din pehle se band hona, yah sab aise kaaran hai jisase shaq philhal shahabuddin par ja rahaa he
 However, family members say that the case should be investigated by the CBI
 shahabuddin ke karibiyon kaa kahana he ki unhen fansaaya ja rahaa he
 In fact, his opponents know that Lalu Yadav would have sent his wife Hina Saheb to some House in the Rajya Sabha or Legislative Council elections next month

 The official assessment conducted by the headquarters of the Army's Maharashtra Gujarat and Goa region clearly acknowledges that the basic training and equipment do not enable the army against counter-terrorism operations
 moolyankan report main kaha gaya he ki isliye in uddeshyon ke liye vishesh ikaiyaan sthapit karne kii jarurat he
 These units should be prepared in such a way that they can be deployed in any part of the country on short notice

 The stance of veteran BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy seems to be changing after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'reprimand'
 apane bayanon se centre sarkaar or bijepi donon ke liye samasya khadi karne vaale swami ne shuukravaar ko twitor par likhaa ki ab vah ek soshal media par kam sakriy rahenge
 This obviously means that the problems will be less frequent for the BJP
 dilachasp baat yah bhi he ki shuukravaar subah unhone twitor ke jariye sidhe modi sarkaar ke 'achche dinon' par prahaar kiya
 He hit both the RBI and the government together with the arrow of 'GDP'
 swami ne subah-subah twitorper likhaa, 'agar main index number ke samulsan-swami theory ko bhartiya jidipi kii gananaa yaa arabiai interest rate par lagu karun to media chillane lagegi ki ye party virdohi gatividhi he
 However, about nine hours after this tweet, he wrote in another tweet that for the next one week he has many issues, so now he will tweet less
 Now Ram Temple, NH, Impleading in Swami Dayananda's WP in SC, Aircel Maxis, CSK ban etc requires me to concentrate
 So few tweets for 1 week — Subramanian Swamy (@ Swamy39) July 1, 2016 There is no doubt that the way the Subramanian Swamy has questioned the country's GDP figures through his tweet, it is sure to hurt the Modi government
 
 kyonki gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki do saal ke kaarykaal ke baad centre sarkaar agar apni safaltaaon ko ginane baithti he to pehla number behatar jidipi ko detii he
 If i apply samuelson-swamy theory of index numbers to India's GDP calculation or RBI interests rates, media will scream anti party activity! - Subramanian Swamy (@ Swamy39) July 1, 2016, please tell that Paul Samuelson was a respected American economist
 swami kai maukon par unhen apana guru tak bataa chuke hai
 Modi government told GDP figures 'good days'
 Last month, the government released the figures for the fourth quarter of the last financial year, claiming that the Indian economy has gained momentum
 beete vitt varsh kii chauthi timahi main 7
 Has registered a growth rate of 9 percent
 modi sarkaar ne is tarah bharat ko duniya kii sabase teji se badhati pramukh arthvyavastha bataaya
 This tweet by political experts is directly labeled as an attack on the PM, while the target is as usual the Finance Ministry and its head Arun Jaitley
 piem ne sunai thi khari-kharigauratlab he ki bijepi ko apane bayanon se asahaj karne vaale rajyasabha saansad subramanyam swami ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne beete dinon khari khari sunai
 The PM said that if someone is making a statement for publicity then it is wrong
 modi ne kaha ki koi bhi party se bada nahin ho saktaa, vahiin swami ne twitor ke jariye piem par palatwaar kiya
 He tweeted on Wednesday morning that he does not run after Publicity, but Publicity runs after him
 pts : New problem: when publicity relentlessly seeks a politician
 30 ovs outside the house, 200 missed calls from channels and paparazzis? Swami took to Twitter on Tuesday morning, remembering Sri Krishna's sermon, "happiness

 ' kaa zikr kiya
 Not only this, he also discussed the principle of balance in the world
 The world is in general equilibrium
 a small change in one parameter effects changes in all variables
 So Krishna advised: Sukh Dukhe

 sabakaypana baccha duniya kaa sabase bhala, eemaandaar, padhai se bhaagta, kisi ke bhi bahekaave main aa janevaala or kamjor lagata he
 If the power of the country is handed over to the mothers, then a very new thing will be known that the real problem of this country is not pakistan-china or corruption, the problem is that the child does not eat anything
 betaa bhale kha-khaakar kaddu hua ja rahaa ho, bitiyaa ke ek se do gaal hue ja rahe homayahi kahegi ki kisi sukhi ja rahi he? maa kii ankhon se seb bhi chuaaraa najar aata he
 Come, repeat the precious words of mother, which you must have heard a thousand times since childhood
 
 
 1
 How long will one sleep - Mother says this is actually the ringing of the morning alarm
 alarm kii khaasiyat ye ki isamen snooj kaa apshan nahin hota
 The second time, without saying anything, your cover will be pulled and even then the fan will be closed as Brahmastra if it is not up
 2
 Who was she talking to? - Every mother has a preloaded Ghoondiraj spy
 sabase tagdi hoti he uski saamudriki
 Seeing smile while chatting in mobile or listening to the songs sung in the bathroom, she can tell which gear your relationship car is running on
 3
 Put the bottle full in the fridge - so mothers do every small and big work in the house
 jab aap madars de kii post par like gin rahe the wo madars deyari par kal ke daheebadon ke liye dahi kharid rahi thim
 Despite this, they keep on doing some minor tasks such as grinding the wheat, filling the water in the cooler, removing the house lizards, peeling peas and filling the water bottle for the fridge
 maje kii baat ye ki kaam jitna bada nahin hota usase zyada baar wo aapse use puraa karne ko kahati hai
 4
 aane do papa ko bataati hum aaj-ye dhamkee desh kii har mummy apane bachche ko din main darjanon baar detii hai
 There are some other threats of this community such as 'today will expel you from home', 'I will break your bones with my father', 'come on, don't tell me your father has improved'
 dhamkiyon ke baad pataa chalata he ki kabhi-kabhi maa bhi jhooth bolti he kyonki na kabhi haddi tuutati he na ghar se nikaale jate hai
 5
 tuje to ham amahiya ke naale se lekar aae the-amahiya ke naale kii jagah chaahe to krishnapura kaa naala kah lijie yaa apane shahar kaa koi bhi naala
 The name can be changed, but not irritated, because whenever the mother is in the mood to pull her legs, she will say that you are not our real daughter, we brought you from the drain
 6
 Do not drink tea will turn black - the world's largest laboratories and researchers can hardly find out where the Indian mothers came from
 aag lage tere phone ko-sabase khatarnaak or sabase zyada baar doharaaya gaya
 The only cry that comes out of every mother's heart is 'if your phone does something, then i have peace'
 aap yakeen nahin karenge aapke smartphone kii betry bhi kisi technical jhol ke chalate nahin maa kii hai ke kaaran nahin chalati
 8
 pahunchate hi phone karnaa-maa kuch bhi kahati rahen unka ye kahana sabase zyada akharata he
 At first, their concern is seen hidden in it
 duusare ye baat tab hi kahi jaati he jab aap unase dur ja rahe hon
 9
 maine to pehle hi manaa kiya tha tuje-maa sab jaanati hai
 Failed the exam? Boyfriend left? Friend turned out to be mean? Or was the car hit somewhere? Mother would say that i had already refused
 wo sab jaanati hai aapke liye kab kya sahi or kya galat he
 10
 khaanaa khaaya?-duniyabar ke arabon logon main is laayak maanakar ki khud kaa khyaal rakh sakate hai aapako mangal bhej diya gaya
 To talk to my mother
 likhakar rakh lijie unka pehla sawaal yahi hoga
 He doesn't care much more than your full stomach
 mummy log na aisi hi hoti hai wo mummy hoti hai na

 yahaan tak ki saarvajanik vitaran pranali ko bhi takreeban har jagah sudrudh karne kii aavashyaktaa hogi

 The Agricultural Costs and Prices Commission of the Government of India itself has calculated all the multiplication tax expenses and is a total expenditure of Rs
 6,82,000 crore for three years
 kaa
 There is little hope that the government can spend so much
 thik se lagu kiye bagaiyr yah puri kavayad kisi kaam kii nahin hogi
 Chidambaram, who is fighting the fight against foreign currency, will not loose his control in the fiscal matter
 or agar kar bhi dete hai to sarkaar main kisi ke paas use lagu karne kaa boota nahin he
 Till a large amount of money will not be used in this work and its management will not be in skilled hands, cheap food grains will not reach the needy people
 manzil tak pahunchane se pehle kamjor kadikhaan paidaa ho jaaengi
 The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices itself has Rs 2,00,000 crore in it
 ke bhrashtachar kaa anumaan lagaaya he
 This is an account of the crises associated with the implementation of the bill
 vaise yah bill apane aap main galatiyon kaa ambara he
 Who will control this entire process? The government has not included panchayati raj institutions as they are not very strong
 nijee kshetra ko shaamil nahin kiya he, kyonki ve bharose ke kaabil nahin hai
 It is obvious that traders are considered responsible for what went wrong in India
 isliye vah bhi baahar ho gaye
 Now the remaining bureaucrats and leaders, who have some control over it, such as Manmohan Singh and Sharad Pawar
 vahi isaki nigaraanee karenge
 Statistics say that there is a problem of malnutrition in India
 lekin is desh main academik susti kii intahaa he
 Made the rules, but while making it forgot to tell what is the reason for malnutrition
 kuposhan kii vajah he protein, aayran or duusare poshak tatwon or vitamin kaa abhaav
 Where does he get fruit? Vegetables, pulses, beans, milk, meat, eggs and fish
 khaadya suraksha bill main kya shaamil nahin he? fal, sabji, daalen, beans, doodh, meet, anda or machhlee
 No mountain is going to be broken immediately by the food security bill, but it will slowly eat the Indian society and economy like a mite
 hamamen se kuch logon ko isse kaaphi phayda bhi hoga
 They will enjoy it for many years to come, but the tree will have to pay the price
 yah kuposhan kii samasya ko or vikaraal bana degaa, kyonki poshak tatwon ke mukaable calories bahut sasti hogi
 This will increase the problem of inflation because farmers will get a better deal to grow wheat and rice
 nijee krishi vyapaar ke liye yah bahut khatarnaak sabit hoga kyonki sarkaar use haashie par dhakel degi
 Prediction of these results is very easy, as was the prediction of the current economic crisis
 ise halke main mat lijie
 This is Rs 1,20,000 crore
 yaa 25,000 karod ru
 Is not a matter of yah kanoon bharat kii buniyaad ko kamjor kar degaa

 manmohan singh par aadhaarit film banaai jaaegi, jisamen anupam kher, manmohan singh kaa kirdaar nibhaayenge, par usase pehle 'da accidental prime ministar' ke produsar sunil bohara ko manmohan singh ji, sonia gandhi ji or un sabhi rajanetaaon se NOC leni hogi jo is film kaa hissaa banenge
 On bjp's bumper victory, Anupam Kher said - the country likes development, not nonsense, besides he said that he will retire in January 2018 and this film will come after this, so someone else will pass it
 lekin unke mutabik byopic ko lekar jo guideline bani hui he unamem koi parivartan nahin kiya jayega
 He hopes that the team of the film will be aware of this
 saath hi unhone yah bhi bataaya ki anupam kher or ashok pandit donon hi sensor board se jude vyakti hai or saath hi is film se bhi jude hue hai to unhen sensor board kii guidelins kaa andaja bhi hoga
 So they did not believe how these people do not know about the NOC yet
 BJP kii banpar jeet par anupam kher ne kaha- desh ko vikaas pasand he bakawaas nahinratnakar guttey karenge is film kaa nirdeshnais film kaa nirdesan ratanaakar guttey kar rahe hai or sunil bohara produs kar rahe hai
 According to Hansal Mehta, he has not even started writing the film yet, but soon he will write the film and only then the rest of the casting will be decided

 khaskar tab jab maamla unki friend, special friend or garlfriend kaa ho
 In the past, Salman's friends also did not understand this, because it was three o'clock in the morning and Salman suddenly reached the house of a friend
 dilachasp baat yah he ki salmaan ke saath unki haalia costar or srilanka kii sundari jacleen furnandis thi
 Apparently, the market of discussions about Bollywood's Most Eligible Bachelor has once again heated up
 charchaa to film 'kik' kii shooting ke dauraan hi shuru ho gai thi, lekin charchaa-e-aam tab hua jab salmaan bhi khule taur par jacleen kii khubsuurati main kaside padhane lage
 Not only this, Salman has even said that even though he has not done any actress on the cinematic screen yet, if he gets a chance, what would Jacqueline want to do
 kya hua us raat
 
 
 According to the news published in an English newspaper, in the past, Salman Khan suddenly made a plan and reached his friend's house at three o'clock in the night
 haalanki salmaan, isse pehle bhi doston ke ghar is tarah pahunch chuke hai
 But this time she was accompanied by former Miss Sri Lanka Jacqueline Fernandes
 bataaya jaataa he ki salmaan or jacleen ko saath dekhakar unke dost bhi chaunk uthe, lekin vah salmaan the or vah dil main aate hai, samaj main nahin
 Salman, 48, dominated the media during the promotion of 29-year-old Jacqueline Salman and Jacqueline's special chemistry film Kick

 By the way, the news will be confirmed only if Salman or Jacqueline will give any clarification in this direction

 The strict Trump administration on Muslim countries has taken steps against Pakistan for the first time, in return Pakistani Senate President Raza Rabbani has issued a directive not to welcome any US MP, diplomat or delegation until further orders

 Mathura city has a special place in the history of general elections
 divangat purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi 1957 main duusare aam chunaav main na keval mathura se chunaav haar gaye the, balki unki jamaanat bhi jabt ho gai thi
 However, Vajpayee, who was among the founders of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh and the Bharatiya Janata Party, won the Balrampur Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh for the first time in this election
 us samay unhone balrampur or mathura do siton se loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladaa tha
 In that election, the independently contested Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh was declared victorious, defeating Congress and Jana Sangh candidates in Mathura
 isse pehle ke chunaav main congress ke pro
 The people who won Krishna Chandra, taking the hand of King Mahendra Pratap, pushed Atal Bihari Vajpayee of Jana Sangh to number four
 tab unhen maatr 10 fisad mat mil paae the
 But at that time, he contested from Balrampur as well as Jana Sangh candidates from Mathura and Lucknow
 lakhanu se to unhone 33 pratishat mat praapt kar jaise-taise izzat bachaa lee thi
 Chaudhary Digambar Singh of the Indian National Congress finished second, Puran Independents third and Vajpayee fourth
 us samay unhen kul pade 2 lakh 34 hajaar 19 maton main se maatr 23 hajaar 620 mat mili the
 However, Bankebihari Maheshwari, the senior-most leader of the Jana Sangh and Bharatiya Janata Party of Mathura and an associate of Atal Bihari Vajpayee in Mathura, says that when the voting was left for one or two days, Vajpayee himself appealed to the people of Mathura She was not to vote for him and win King Mahendra Pratap
 iske peeche vah tark dete hai ki vaajapeyi congress ko har keemat par haraana chaahate the
 According to him, the sacrifice and dedication of King Mahendra Pratap for Mathura and the whole country and society was more important than becoming an MP
 isliye ve unhen jitaana chaahate or unhone yah karke bhi dikhaa diya
 However, the history of Mathura Lok Sabha seat has also been very bizarre
 agle hi chunaav main mathura ne palata khaaya or puraa parinaam ulta ho gaya
 In 1962, Raja Mahendra Pratap finished second and Chaudhary Digambar Singh won the election
 mathura ke sadabad kshetra ke kursanda nivasee choudhary digambar singh is janapad ke un pratinidhiyon main se ek hai jo is seat se teen baar loksabhaa pahunchane main kaamyaab hue
 After 1962, he emerged victorious in the by-elections in 1970 during the fourth Lok Sabha due to the demise of then Mathura MP Giriraj Sharan Singh alias Raja Bachhu Singh
 iske baad, 1980 main janata party (secular) ke tikat par teesri baar mathura ke saansad bane
 By the way, for the first Lok Sabha he was also elected as an MP from etah-mainpuri-mathura seat
 unke baad bhaajapa ke chau
 Tejveer Singh made the trio by winning continuously in 1996, 1998 and 1999
 unase purv congress ke kunwar maanavendra singh 1984 main bhartiya rashtriya congress tathaa 1989 main janata dal se, do baad jeet chuke the
 Kunwar Manvendra Singh was again successful in getting re-elected as a Congress candidate in 2004 and he also became a three-time MP in Mathura
 mathura seat se jeetne waalon ke kai kisse bahut mashhoor hai
 80-year-old Rambabu Tiwari, a pygmy account agent of Syndicate Bank, originally a resident of Manat, says Raja Bachu Singh, a member of the Bharatpur royal family, who became an MP from Mathura in 1967, won without even setting foot in the area
 us samay giriraaj sharan singh urf raja bachchu singh ne elaan kar diya tha ki ve mathura main pair tak nahin rakhenge or chunaav jitkar dikhaaenge
 For this, by simply publishing an appeal on his behalf in the name of propaganda, helicopters had pamphlets all over the Mathura district and won by heavy votes
 unke baad, 1971 main congress ke thaa
 Chakleshwar Singh won
 1977 main bahari pratyaashee maniram bagdi ne to bhartiya lokdal kii tikat par aisa record banaaya jise abhi tak koi dal yaa koi pratyaashee todna to dur, aasapaas tak nahin pahunch sakaa he
 He recorded a record 76 out of 3 lakh 92 thousand 137 votes cast at that time
 79 pratishat (2 lakh 96 hajaar 518) mat praapt kar ek aisa kirtiman sthapit kar diya jo bayalis varsh baad tak akshunn he
 But, what his voters remember most is that in order to get rid of the rule of the Emergency Implementing Congress, along with the vote in the election meetings, they also openly demanded the note, and the currency of that time was Spread the bag from the smallest coin (one paisa, two paisa) and did not miss it from people
 duusare, ve ek baar jeet kar gaye to phir kabhi mathura kii ore mudakar bhi nahin dekha
 Probably, this is the reason that the voters of Mathura are unable to form a quick rapport with the external candidates
 lekin, jab ve apane yahaan netritv-shoonyata kaa ahsaas karte hai to phir unheen par daanv khilne ko majaboor ho jate hai
 In 1991, the Bharatiya Janata Party gave Sachchidanand Hari Sakshi of Sadhu Samaj an opportunity to become an MP
 lekin, paanch varsh ke kaarykaal main ve kuch aisa prabhaav na chhod sake jisase party unhen dubaara yahaan se ladaa paati
 In 2009, Congress-backed Rashtriya Lok Dal candidate Jayant Chaudhary captured a Jat voter-dominated seat
 lekin, pichley chunaav main ve narendra modi kii aandhi main use bachaa na sake
 As a BJP candidate Hemamalini won by over 3 lakh 30 thousand votes
 is baar bhaajapa ne ek baar phir unheen par daanv lagaaya he
 Whereas, SP-BSP-RLD alliance has given opportunity to Narendra Singh, younger brother of former MP Kunwar Manvendra Singh
 lekin congress ke mahesh pathak nishchit rup se vipaksh ke maton kaa bantwaaraa kar unhen kamjor karne kaa prayaas karenge
 In this seat, the fight between these three candidates is seen
 chhot parde ke lokapriy serial 'diya or baati ham' ke phans ke liye ek buree khabar he
 Actually this serial is going to close soon
 sho kii taraf se is baat kii pushti kar di gai he ki15 agastako iskaa aakhri episod prasaarit kiya jayega
 The reason behind this is said to be the declining TRP of the show
 sandhya, surajaur bhabho ke kirdaar se ghar-ghar main apni jagah bana chuke sho ke kalakaaron ko darshak kaaphi miss karne vaale hai
 There was a time when the TRP of this show used to be on top and today the decreasing TRP of the show has forced it to go off air
 khabaron kii maane to is sho ke band hone kii ek vajah serial ke mukhya kalakationas or deepikake badhate nakhron ko bhi mana ja rahaa he jise ab management uthaane ko taiyaar nahin he
