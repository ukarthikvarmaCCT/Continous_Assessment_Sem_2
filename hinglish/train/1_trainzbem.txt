 Baba Ramdev has given two ways to build Ram temple
 unhone kaha ki ram mandir kaa nirmaan do tareeke se kiya ja saktaa he
 The first is that people start building the temple themselves, which will not be good

 Baba Ramdev, who arrived in Ahmedabad and Vadodara to launch 'patanjali Apparel' stores, said that another ordinance should be brought in Parliament for the construction of the temple
 yah sampradayik sadbhaavna ke liye acha hoga or bhagwaan ram kii ore hamaara sachcha aabhaar bhi hoga

 isse pehle unhone kaha tha ki desh kii janata kii bhaawanaaon kaa sammaan karte hue sarkaar is par kuch naa kuch kadam jarur uthaaegi or bhavy ram mandir nirmaan kaa rasta saaf karegi
 Yoga Guru Baba Ramdev has said that if the Ram temple is not built, then the communal atmosphere will heat up in the country and social disharmony will arise from it

 Baba said that on the issue of Ram temple, we will have to work on the concept of not now or never

 Usually farmers have been cheated on fake seeds and food, but hundreds of farmers of Chhattisgarh were cheated in the name of buying tractors
 ab unke upar giraftaar kii talwaar latak rahi he

 masalan kabhi nakli khaadya, beej ko lekar to kabhi chitfund companiyon ke chakkar main
 But this time farmers are cheated on buying tractors
 sunne main bhale ye atapata lage, lekin yah sach he
 The farmers have been chosen by a gang that they have looted their hard-earned money, but despite all these, the sword of arrest is hanging over them
 darasal, is giroh ne kisaanon ko sookhe se hone vaale nuksaan kaa hawala de kar tractor banane vaali companiyon kii dariyaadilii bataai
 He told them that companies have decided to provide tractors at cheap rates to farmers due to the problem
 kisaan is giroh ke jhaanse main aa gaye or apni rakam lutaa baithe
 Usually, tractors and trolleys of different companies cost between eight and ten lakhs, but this gang spent stolen tractors for only two to three lakh rupees
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki chhattisgarh ke alaava maharashtra, madhyapradesh, odisha or duusare rajyon se ye giroh tractaron kii chori karata tha
 Those tractors and trolleys were colored and made completely new with the help of fake documents
 dastavejon main nae tractor kaa hawala dene se kisaan bhi is giroh ke jhaanse main aa jate the
 Hundreds of farmers in the state bought such tractors hand-in-hand, but when this gang busted, the farmers also got into trouble
 ab police tractaron ko jabt karne main juty he
 The condition of the farmers is slim, because one has lost money from their hands, the issue of theft from above has increased the chances of getting registered on them
 haalanki kisaan sarkari gavaah banane ko taiyaar ho gaye hai, taaki giraftaar se batch sake or is giroh ke khilaaf police ko pukhta saboot muhaiyaa ho sake
 At present, the police have arrested eight members of this gang, but the chief gangster is still out of the grip of the police
 police ne apni praathmik jaanch main paaya he ki chori ke tractaron kaa farji registration parivahan vibhaag main bhi hua he
 In such a situation, it is being expressed that even the transport department can have wires connected to this gang
 philhal police tamaam tractaron ko jabt karne main juty hui he
 After all, the police have captured eight people of this gang for taking the details of trafficking and buying and selling of tractors

 sahitya kaa gyaan ab ek vyapak saanskrithik pariprekshya or duniya ke bahut se vichaaron, siddhanton or avadharanaon ko jane bina sambhav nahin he
 Literature is still the most important human form of knowledge
 yah aam nagarikon ke liye pani or mobile kii tarah jaruri he
 Arun Maheshwar Shri , Managing Director of Vani Prakashan said that there are 2660 entries in the Hindi Sahitya Jnanakosh
 yah 7 khandon main 4560 prishthon kaa granth he
 There are a total of 32 subjects related to Hindi literature, history, literature theory, etc
, besides social science, religion, Indian culture, human rights, mythological character, environment, Western principles, translation theory, Renaissance, globalization, post-colonial discourse etc
 unka kahana tha ki hindi kii prakruti or bhoomika anya bhartiya bhashaaon se vishisht he
 Therefore, in addition to the Hindi states in the knowledge base, an attempt has been made to introduce languages and cultures of South India, north-east and other Indian regions
 isamen hindi kshetra kii 48 lok bhashaaon or kala-samskruti par saamagree he
 According to Shambhunath, in the light of the new explosions of knowledge that have occurred in the world in the last fifty years, this is the first knowledge dictionary made in Hindi in Indian languages
 yah vidhyaarthiyon or aam hindi pathakon ke bauddhik kshitij ke bahutarafa vistaar main sahaayak ho saktaa he
 Around 275 writers from across the country wrote the entries with hard work and with their historical support, they made knowledge
 shambhunath ne bataaya ki is gyaanakosh ke nirmaan main radhavallabh treepathi, jawarimall parakh, avadhesh prasad singh or rajakishor jaise khyaati praapt vidwaanon ne bahut shram kiya he
 We did workshops in Kolkata
 internet kii suvidhaayen leen or nayi paddatiyon ko apanaaya
 Our aim was to create a comprehensive, factual, inclusive and comprehensive knowledge base
 yah gyaan kaa ek vikasshil kosh he or ek rashtriya shuruyaat he
 We believe that the multi-storey building of knowledge will continue to be built on its foundation by the coming generations of Hindi
 angrezi main incychlopedia main puraani chijen or avadharanaayen hai, jabaki ham 21veen sadi ke atyaadhunik mode par he
 Wikipedia cannot be trusted completely, especially here there are very confusing and limited information in Hindi
 hindi sahitya gyaanakosh ke varisht or naye lekhakon ne internet sahit kai sroton se suchnaayen leen, satyata ko jaanch kar tathyon ko chunaa or yathasambhav pravishtiyon ko adhyatan rup diya
 No knowledge can be formed by keeping aside the English texts and knowledge repositories
 lekin ham yah bhi jaanate hai ki pashchim main bane incychlopedia ne aadhunik gyaan vyavastha ke naam par agyaan or europe kendrikta kaa prachaar adhik kiya he
 We have tried not to be beset by the past nor by the colonial knowledge system
 patrakaron ke ek sawaal kaa uttar dete hue shambhunath ne kaha ki hindi bhashi lekhakon or aam logon main us jaateeyata kaa bodh nahin jo anya bhashaaon ke lekhakon main he
 This is the reason why this work was delayed in Hindi compared to other languages
 hindi sahitya main vyaktvaad or aantarik kalah adhik he
 If we had considered ourselves as 'hindi', it would have been prepared long ago
 yah hindi kii saanskrithik garima kaa pratik he
 The first Hindi encyclopedia of Hindi was prepared between 1916 and 1931 in the editing of Nagendranath Basu
 yah unke bangla vishwakosh kii hi hindi chaaya tha
 After this, 'hindi Sahitya Kosh' came in 1956
 nagari prachaarini sabha ne 1960 se 70 ke bich hindi vishwakosh prakashit kiya tha
 Now after this we can see the 'hindi Sahitya Gyan Kosh' of the Indian Language Council as a major intervention
 isko granth rup dene or vitaran vyavastha main vaani prakaashan kii aitihaasik bhoomika he
 Sanmarg of Kolkata has printed it
 patrakaron ke prashn kaa uttar dete hue arun maheshwari ne bataaya kii yahan judaa sahitya shabd apane vishad arth main he
 It includes philosophy, politics, history etc
 yah vishwa kosh se kahin aage kii baat he or sahitya shabd ke judne se vyapak vistaar le letaa he
 He welcomed these suggestions that came from the journalists in the press conference, adding new amendments to it every year and introduce them to the readers
 saath hi iske digital sanskaran ko bhi sheeghra laane kii baat kahi
 Not being able to create encyclopedias in the form of foreign languages and up-to-date dictionaries in foreign languages is one of the major reasons for the intellectual backwardness of this country
 apni bhashaa ke ek sugathit gyaanakosh kaa hona rashtriya jaagran kaa chihn he
 How useful printed knowledge can be in the era of rapid information flow of the Internet
 soochna kranti ne ‚Äòagyanta kaa shaastra‚Äô bade paimaane par gadha he
 There is a web of misleading information in this era
 soochnaaon kii itani adhik dishaao se itani adhik bharmaar ho gayi he ki unke bich gyaan kho sa gaya he
 There is a difference between knowledge and information
 gyaan soochnaaon ke parspar sambandh or takaraav se janmi ek vikasshil chetana he
 The hallmark of knowledge is that one knowledge opens the way to another knowledge
 gyaan hi he jo manushya ko manushya banaata he, use prem karnaa sikhaata he, khud sochane kii shakti detaa he or manushya ke swatantrayabodh kaa vistaar karata he
 There is no final statement in the entries of Hindi Sahitya Jnanakosh
 yah aage kii jaankariyon ke liye maarg kholta he or apane pathakon ko jigyaasu or gatisheel banaata he
 As far as its printed form is concerned, there is a different joy of reading and knowing something in hand
 samaaj main pustak haath main lekar athmiya dhang se padhane ke yug kaa kabhi ant nahin hoga
 Information flow on the Internet is interrupted by advertisements
 aap dharm ke bare main kuch pard rahe hai ki turant burgers kaa vigyaapan aa koodegaa
 There is no irony with printed texts

 Sandeep Dixit, the son of Chief Minister Sheila Dixit, who was Chief Minister in Delhi for 15 years, has opened a front within her own party
 ek blog ke zariye unhone dilli chunaav se pehle apni maa ke khilaaf muhim chalaane ke peeche ajay maakan kii ore se ishaara kiya he
 They allege that some of the party leaders are responsible for weakening the Congress in Delhi
 congress ke purv saansad sandip dikshit kehete hai, 'dilli congress ne mere saamne mushkil halaat khadey kar die hai
 The Delhi Congress is running under the leadership of a person who has been directly attacking Sheela Dixit with her false reports

 Some time ago he also came into controversy when he said that the time has not come to hand over the command of the party to Rahul Gandhi
 haalanki is nae blog ke baad sandip dikshit congress chhodane kii baat ko sire se kaarij kar rahe hai
 He says, i will do whatever is possible to re-establish the Congress in Indian politics
 ek aise vaqt main jab shila ko upi main siem kaa cheharaa banaaya gaya he, sandip kaa maananaa he ki unhone jo mudda uthaaya he usase party ko upi main nuksaan nahin, balki faaydaa hi hoga
 Sandeep Dixit is bent on giving a rebellious agreement to the party's camp, where some party leaders are trying to convince him, the same is clearing the line between the prophet Azad Sheela and Sandeep
 tippaniyan Congress general secretary and in-charge of Uttar Pradesh elections Ghulam Nabi Azad says, i think we have taken the responsibility of Sheila Dixit, cannot take responsibility of the whole family

 haryana vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa abhaya singh chautaala ne apane bade bhai ajay singh chautaala or unke donon beton par karaara hamalaa bolaa he
 Amid deepening family strife, on Wednesday, Abhay Singh Chautala alleged that Ajay Chautala and his two sons were playing against the BJP and Congress to weaken the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD)

 Ajay Chautala's sons- Hisar MP Dushyant Chautala and Digvijay Chautala had already been expelled from the party

 He said, 'I want to ask whether in recent week Ajay Chautala or any member of his family has been heard uttering a single word against the opposition party Congress and BJP? Their goal is not to remove BJP or Congress from power, but they are playing in their hands, which want to weaken and break the INLD
 'is samvaadadaata sammelan membhay chautaalaake saath party ke nau vidhayak, do saansad, pradesh adhyaksh ashok aroda or anya netaa bhi maujuud rahe
 Ajay Chautala (57), who is serving a 10-year prison sentence along with his father and former Chief Minister OP Chautala in the Haryana teacher recruitment scam, is out on two weeks payroll
 apane bade bhai or bhatijon par prahaar karte hue abhaya chautaala ne kaha, ‚Äòmujhe mere bhai or unke parivaar dwaara khuleam duryodhana or jayachand kaha gaya he

 Ajay Singh, chief of the INLD, who was expelled from the party on Monday, has been expelled from his primary membership of the party, on the charge of anti-party activities, Oom Prakash Chautalane, after which the dispute has deepened in the Chautala family

 buudhvaar ko nitish kumaar ne apni cabinet baithak bulaai jisamen tejasvi yadav bhi shaamil hue
 Before the cabinet meeting, JDU leader KC Tyagi made a big statement, saying that JD u has not asked for the resignation of Tejashwi Yadav, nor has given any ultimatum for it
 unhen kise upmukhyamantri bananaa he yah RJD kaa faisla he
 Earlier on Tuesday, after the meeting of JDU, there were reports that JDU gave RJD a four-day ultimatum
 ke si tyagika kahana he ki isamen kisi kii hamane koi baat nahin kahi he, na hin koi ultimatum diya he
 We have only said that in public life, people should go and clean things
 kasee tyaagi bole ki kis ko upmukhyamantri bananaa he kisko netaa bananaa he, yah argedy kaa apana faisla he
 Let me tell you that Tejashwi, who himself met the media for the first time after his name in the scam, said that this is a conspiracy of the BJP to break the grand alliance
 vah bhaybheet he, isliye is tarah ke aarope laga rahi he
 RJD Supremo's son Tejashwi said, "it has been our policy from day one that there will be a policy of zero tolerance in case of corruption
 teenon vibhaag jo mere paas rahaa koi ungali nahin uthaa saktaa or hamane sabhi ke liye kaam kiya he
 With this, he said, "after becoming a minister, we have not done anything wrong and at the time when the scam is being talked about, i was just 13-14 years old, then even my mustache did not come
" bataaiye 13-14 saal kaa koi ladkaa kya ghotaalaa karegaa?' The results of three assembly elections in the Northeast came on Saturday

 During his speech, he mentioned the northerly angle of Vastu
 PM modi kaa kadaa sandesh- apane hi dharm kaa nuksaan kar rahe hai kattarpanthiishaan kone ko lekar kya kaha modi ne?unhone kaha, 'jo baat main kah rahaa hum use maine suna he
 Although there is neither my knowledge nor my faith in it
 jo imaarat banaate hai wo ek manyata rakhte hai
 'modi said,' The north corner is the most important place in the construction of the building in Vastu
 vaastushastri iskaa bahut dhyaan rakhte hai
 Meaning that once the north-east is cured (in building the house), the entire building gets fixed
 aaj mujhe khushi is baat kii he ki north east kaa yah konaa vikaas kii yatra kaa desh main netritv karne aage aayaa he
 'let me tell you that in the Vastu Shastra which Modi has mentioned, he is considered very holy and powerful
 vaastu main kya he ishan kaa mahatv?1
 Actually, in Vaastu Shastra the northeast angle is that corner of the ground which is situated in the north-east direction
 yah uttar or purv disha kaa milan bindu he
 In terms of the Indian map, the North East is called the North East by the Prime Minister
 2
 According to Vastu Shastra, the gods and goddesses reside at the northeast
 kisi ghar main ishan kone ko sabase pavitra konaa mana jaataa he
 For this reason, construction like kitchen, toilet or garbage house is considered completely forbidden in this direction
 3
 In religious scripture, Lord Shiva also has a name Ishaan
 uttar purv disha main bhagwaan shiv ke aadhipaty kii vajah se is disha ko ishan kone kaha jaataa he
 This region is considered the most auspicious, source of energy
 4
 This region is also considered auspicious because holy divine powers grow here

 Ashutosh Gowariker has urged people to watch it before creating any concept about his upcoming film Panipat
 abhi kuch dinon pehle 'panipat' ke trailor (panipat Trailer) ke relies hone ke baad se hi ise lekar vivaadon kaa daur jari he
 While promoting the film on Wednesday evening, Ashutosh said, ‚ÄúI think people need to watch the film
 film ko dekhne ke baad unhen unke saare sawaalon ke jawaab mil jaaenge
 When they see the film, then they will be able to feel that it is made with good intentions and the film has all the good things

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi will once again adopt the political formula from the temple in the assembly elections in Rajasthan before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 isaki shuruyaat isi saal 15 july ke aasapaas ko pradesh ke kisi bade mandir se ho sakati he
 Based on the information received from sources, the Pradesh Congress Committee has sent a list of 10 such important temples for the visit of Nehru Gandhi
 congress alaakaman ne bheji gai suchi ke aadhaar par rahul gandhi ke kaarykram ko antim rup dene main lagi he
 The Congress, obviously marginalized by the 2014 elections, is leaving no stone unturned to remove the anti-hindu impression on itself
 mandir yatra tay nahinsaal ke aakhir main hone vaale rajasthan ke vidhansabhachunaavaki taiyaari main lage pradesh congress ke netarahul gandhike daure ko lekar utsahit hai
 In informal conversations, Congress leaders believe that the temple philosophy in Gujarat and then Karnataka has been successful
 rajasthan main bhi party ko iskaa laabh milegaa
 State Congress media chairperson Archana Sharma says that Rahul Gandhi will come to Rajasthan, but it has not been decided where and which religious place he will visit
 rahul keval mandir hi nahin balki sabhi dharmik sthalon par jate hai or yah aasthaa kaa vishay he raajnneeti kaa nahin
 For the past one month, senior officials of the state Congress have been busy in preparing the road map for the strategy of assembly elections
 jaipur main party ke pradeshdhyaksh sachin payalat kii ore se bheji gai suchi ke aadhaar par dilli main ashok gahalot ise antim rup dene me lage hai
 The 10 temples selected during the visit of the party as well as caste watchdog president Rahul Gandhi have influence in about 50 assembly seats in 8 districts of Rajasthan
 eisisi ko bheji gai mandiron kii suchi main pisisi ne kailadevi mandir, tanot mata mandir, karani mata mandir, saalasar balaji, brahmaji mandir pushkar, govind devji, saanwaliya seth, tripura sundari ko shaamil kiya he
 There are 5 of these temples which are the main centers of faith of the particular caste
 jaahir he congress kimandir kii is siyasatmen dharm ke saath-saath jati vishesh ko bhi saadhane kii prayaas he
 The Congress has designed Rahul Gandhi's program in such a way that after the temple visit, he will also meet the temple priest and people of the society
 aapako yaad dilaa den ki rahul gandhi kesomnath yatrake dauraan bhi baari vivaad hua tha
 The Congress had to release a picture of Rahul's Janeu while giving a clarification, and the party benefited from this formula of Rahul in the Gujarat elections
 yahi vajah he ki congress ne rahul ke mandir darshan yatra ko karnataka main bhi aajamaaya, yah alag baat he ki vahaan party sabase badi party ke rup main ubharkar nahin aa saki, lekin vahaan sarkaar jedies or congress gathbandhan kii bani
 By assuming a return to power, the Congress will continue this formula not only in Rajasthan but Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh this year and till the next year's general elections

 Vijaypal Singh standing in Dehradun could not understand what his uncle was saying in Kedarnath's Holocaust
 Vijay made the call several times but by then the mobile signal and perhaps the door of life with him had been broken
 bhagwaan ke ghar main paise ke laalach ne aadmi ko narpishaach bana diya
 This was not the only call, after the Uttarakhand accident, countless such stories are coming out live, which do not believe that all these abominations are also being done in this world

 In this, a person is trying to take a gold ring from the finger of a dead woman
 chunki laash phool chuki he, isliye plas kii madad se bhi anguthi nahin utarati
 Finally, the person bites his finger and removes the ring
 video main ek mahila kii aawaaj bhi sunai de rahi he or saath hi us badjaat shaks kii hansi bhi jo ungliyaan katkar anguthi utaar rahaa he
 When the police recovered the bundles of gold and notes from the seams of the monks, it was understood that wearing the Gerua cloth did not cut Maya's bond

 According to the police, these people have looted the goods and money of the victims

 There were also allegations of bribery to be taken before the helicopter
 rupye to ek payalat ne bhi maange logon ko kedarnath se baahar nikaalane ke liye

 lekin jawaab dene kii bajaae payalat sio se ulajh gaye or donon ke bich hathapayee kii naubat aa gai
 However, the pilot later refused to ask for any bribe
 isi heliped par duusare payalat ko isliye daant khaani padi kyonki vah aise biimaar logon ko phata se dehradun le aayaa tha, jinhen ilaaj kii sakht jarurat thi
 Actually, this pilot was flying a helicopter deployed by the Punjab government
 udaan bharne se pehle hi payalat ko sakht hidaayat di gai thi ki vah sirf punjab ke yatriyon ko hi bachaa kar laae
 But when the pilot reached Fata, six people from Hyderabad who were rescued from Kedarnath first came before him
 doctoron ne kaha kii ki in logon kii haalat kharaab he or inhen turant madad kii darkaar he
 The pilot forgot the order of the government babu in front of the mankind's prowess
 lekin balihaari lalaphitaashahee kii ki afasar mahoday ne helipad par payalat ko khub khari-khoti sunai or helicopter main eendhan bhi nahin bharne diya

 php?page_id=118 Reservation For Upper Caste After the Central Government's decision to provide 10 percent reservation to the poor of the general category, all its implications have started to be discussed
 ek sawaal yah saamne aayaa he ki das fisadi kaa aarakshan lene vaale varg kaa candidet upree merit main aane par anarakshit shrenee main aayega ki nahin? kai jaankaar yah kah rahe hai ki saamaanya varg ke garibon ke liye avasar ek-chauthai ho jaaenge, kyonki vah das fisadi tak simit ho jayega or baaki 40 fisadi anarakshit shrenee main use jagah nahin milegi
 But if you look at all the previous examples, this does not seem to be true
 abhi tak jo parampara rahi he uske mutabik essi / asti yaa obisi varg kaa koi candidet yadi saamaanya kii merit main aata he to use saamaanya varg kii naukari main shaamil kar liya jaataa he or use arakshit candidet nahin mana jaataa
 At this time, it is just a condition that he has not taken any relaxation like age limit in his reserved category
 is aadhaar par dekhen to yah saaf lagata he ki garib aarakshan shrenee kaa saamaanya varg kaa candidet oonchi merit main aane par anarakshit shrenee main compit kar saktaa he
 His path will be easier for this, because the candidates of this category will hardly get any relaxation like age limit or lower fees
 deepa i
 V
 banaam bharat sarkaar kaa maamlakota ke tahat aavedan karne vaale candidet ke saamaanya varg main naukari paane ke bare main deepa i
 a decision of the Supreme Court in the case of v vs Government of India is considered to be the case
 deepa i
 V
 ne obisi category ke tahat aavedan diya tha
 If no candidate passed the 'minimum cut off point' of the examination in the general category, Deepa appealed that she be considered eligible for the job under the general category
 sarkaar ne aisa karne se manaa kar diya
 Deepa challenged the decision in the High Court and approached the Supreme Court when the appeal was dismissed in the High Court
 supreme court ne hoicourt kii baat maanate hue deepa kii daleel khaarij kar di
 The Supreme Court said, 'the appellant took the age relaxation under the OBC category, and gave the interview also in the OBC category, so he cannot get a job in the general category
 'tina daabi kaa maamlacivil services kii topper tina daabi ke maamle se bhi ise samajha ja saktaa he
 Tina Dobbi topped the Nesivil Services, but was placed in the SC category, as she applied under the SC Candidate in the preliminary examination and got the benefit of the cutoff
 supreme court ne apane aadesh main kaha tha, 'essi / asti or obisi category se riyaayat lene ke baad aise ummidavaaron ke liye general category kaa faaydaa lene ke liye saaf seemaa tay kii gai he
 The rules of Department of Parsonel and Training are also clear that concession is given for SC / ST and OBC category candidates, age limit, experience, qualification and number of opportunities in written examination are more than in general category
 Therefore, such candidates will be considered ineligible for the general category
 'lekin is faisle main ek pech he
 Even the Supreme Court ruling cannot prevent a reserved class candidate from joining the general category, provided he has not taken any relaxation in his quota category
 ab bhi nahin he koi rokadlit activist alakh niranjan bataate hai, 'ab bhi anarakshit varg ke candidet oonchi merit main aane par saamaanya shrenee main naukari paa rahe hai
 In this case, just in view of the order of the Supreme Court, the check is done so that it has not taken any limit or any other kind of relaxation under the age limit
 ' yani agar kisi candidet ne kisi tarah kaa relaxeshan nahin liya ho to use saamaanya varg kii naukari mil sakati he
 In the 2010 Jitendra Kumar Singh vs State of UP case, the Supreme Court had also made it clear that if one gets a job in the general category as per the reserved candidate merit, then it will be treated as a candidate of the general category and not the reserved category
 is aadesh se bhi yah saaf hota he ki arakshit candidet ke candidet ko saamaanya varg main jane par koi roak nahin he
 Which general category candidates will get the benefit of reservation? - Those whose annual income is less than 8 lakhs - Those who have less than 5 acres of cultivated land - Those who have a house of less than 1000 square feet - Who has a municipal corporation Have less than 109 yards of notified land - having a municipal non-notified land of less than 209 yards in a municipal corporation - which were not yet covered under any form of reservation soshal trade ke baad ab web work company tamaam agenciyon ke radar par he

 Elections are being held in the Lok Sabha seats of Jammu and Kashmir but Assembly elections are not being held
 suraksha kaa jo masalaa loksabhaa chunaav main he vahi vidhansabha chunaav ke liye bhi rahegaa
 Then why the assembly elections are not being held there, the CPI-M General Secretary Sitaram Yechury reached the security meeting of Aaj Tak
 unase sawaal kiye tivitien ke cancelting editor rajdeep saradesai ne
 Sitaram Yechury said that an all party delegation under the leadership of Home Minister Rajnath Singh had gone to Jammu and Kashmir 3 years ago
 sabane vahaan ke halaat kaa jayja liya
 Then came the government's written statement that we will work on two fronts
 pehla jammu kashmir ke logon main confidence building, jisase unka aatmavishvaas laute, unhen rojgaar mili or doosraa kashmir se jude jitne bhi paksh hai unke saath baat kii jaae
 Yechury raised questions that these statements were issued by the government but why no further action was taken on it
 sarkaar kyon nahin bataati ki us par kya hua
 He demanded that even today he remains on the point that the government should proceed on what he said at that time
 huriyat ke logon ko hiraasat main liya ja rahaa he jelon main daalaa ja rahaa he aise main unase baat kaise ho sakati he
 On this, Yechury said that he cannot talk to them but it can happen to other people
 yechuri ne ek sawaal ke jawaab main yah bhi kaha ki diplomasi ke raste kabhi band nahin hote
 But diplomacy efforts were not made in these 4 years
 yechuri ne kaha ki raajnneetik prakriya to apnaani hi hogi
 He said that it is beyond comprehension that the conditions are good for holding the Lok Sabha elections and the situation is not good for the assembly elections
 unhone kaha ki jis suraksha kii jarurat loksabhaa chunaav ke liye he usee suraksha vyavastha kii jarurat vidhansabha chunaav karaane ke liye bhi he lekin sarkaar ne ise kyon roak diya yah samaj main nahin aata
 Is the attack on Pulwama a failure of intelligence? In response to this question, Yechury said that this question was not raised by the opposition
 pulavama hamale ke baad jammu kashmir ke rajyapal ne yah sawaal uthaaya
 Presently there is President's rule i
e
 these questions were raised by the government
 unhone kaha ki rashtriya suraksha main koi paksh yaa vipaksh nahin hota
 All people are with the government

 All the leaders of the opposition supported it and said that action should be taken against the terrorists
 lekin sarkaar ne pehle iskaa raajnneetikaran karne kaa prayaas kiya

 unhone kaha ki aatanki hamalaa karte hai to puure desh kii janata ek saath virodh karti he
 But the terrorists want us to fight among ourselves
 yechuri ne kaha ki sarkaar or media foot daalane kii koshish karte hai jo ekta chaahate hai vah virodh nahin karte hai

 Swanson said one possibility is that the lava may slowly heat the groundwater and build a new lava lake at the last
 lava pani ke sampark main aakar chote visphot kar saktaa he
 The other possibility is that if magma increases rapidly a large explosion can occur

 yah udaarikaran kii duniya main kadam rakhane se pehle kaa saal tha or duniya bahut hi dhimi raftaar se chalaa karti thi
 Used to be far away from marketization and emotions used to run in the heart
 yah vah daur tha jab ek insaan kaa kanoon ke haathon chot khaanaa bollywood kaa pasandida vishay hua karata tha, or ise cinemagharon main khub jagah milti thi or box offis par kamai bhi khub hoti thi
 In the same year, when Ajay Mehra knocked over the injured, from the youth to the families immersed in the emotion, he ran to the cinema and the film came in the list of the best films of that year and Sunny Deolan went to bat with his acting
 yah vah daur tha jab piresi apane shabaab par nahin thi or internet ne hamaare jivan main dastak nahin di thi
 Today, after 26 years, the whole world has changed
 aaj samaaj se ladane vaale hero alag tarah ke ho gaye hai
 Larger than life heroes are becoming less of a screen and our concerns have changed already
 beshak cinema bhi badla he lekin sani deol kii'ghayal vans agen'aaj bhi usee tewaron or kahani vaali film he jo 1980 yaa 1990 ke dashak main aayaa karti thim
 Just to give him a fresh color, he has tried to add things related to the youth
 sani deol ne eemaandaaree se aisa cinema banane kii koshish kii he jisamen buraai or achchhai kii ladaai he
 But the same thing was also in the injured
 darshak ghayal se aage kii cheez chaahate the jo film main miss he
 How much of the story in the story begins with the injured and it is a good connection point that the film is made a sequel and started from the back
 ab ajay mehara (sani deol) patrkaar ban chukaa he or samaaj kii buraaiyon par paradaa uthaanaa uskaa kaam he
 This time there is a villain like Balwant Rai, Narendra Jha, who rules the city
 lekin ek din ek aparaadh hota he or chaar yuva uske chashmadid ban jate hai
 Then there is a cloud of crisis on their life
 phirasni deolek baar phir se apane puraane avatar main aa jate hai or badmaashon ko chhathi kaa doodh yaad dilaane lagate hai
 There was a bit of tightness in the story and Sunny and wounding like dialogues were sure to happen
 vaise sani jahaan bhi thode se garm hote hai film main majaa aata he
 Star Apelasani has returned as Ajay Mehra in Deolfilm but he does not freeze in emotional scenes
 jis tarah ke imoshans unhone ghayal main dikhaae the vaise is baar missing he
 It is fun to see them in action
 aisa ection sirf vahi kar sakate hai
 Narendra Jha plays as the villain in the film and also gives fun
 soha, tiska or baaki sab thik he
 Four youngsters have tried their hardest in the film
 kamai kii batsani deol kii film he or unke chaahane waalon kii koi kami nahin he
 For the lovers of Sunny Deol, this is no less than a treat
 phir unhen ection avatar main dekhne waalon ke liye to mjedaar he hi
 But when compared to the injured, the taste will deteriorate there itself
 thik-thaak ection film ke taur par ghayal vans agen niraash nahin karti he
 The film is also kept very tight
 single screen ke liye parfect

 BJP formed the government at the center in the year 2014 and then in many states also formed the BJP government
 saal 2017 tak bijepi hindustan ke 71 fisadi hisse main chaa gai
 All this was the result of the magic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the political strategy of BJP President Amit Shah

 Inaugurating the Sansad Adarsh gram Yojana on Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the Indian development model should be demand based rather than current supply based
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki gramin janata kii aakankshaon ko puraa kiye jane kii jarurat he
 Inaugurating the scheme at Vigyan Bhavan here, Modi said, "even before there have been government schemes for rural development, but there was no change from them
 " According to this plan, mps have to adopt three villages and develop them as a model village
 ek gaanv main vikaas kaa kaam varsh 2016 tak puraa kiya janaa hoga or do anya gaanvon kaa vikaas 2019 tak karnaa hoga
 Modi said, "we have to change our perspective
 saansad jab kisi gaanv ko god lene ke liye jaaen to unke dimag main koi raajnneetik baat nahin honi chahie
 " pradhanmantri ne kaha ki vah bhi apane sansadeey kshetra varanasi main ek gaanv god lenge
 He said, "I too have to choose a village under the Varanasi parliamentary constituency
 is sambandh main mujhe kuch paraamarsh mili hai
 i will go there, discuss and then decide
 " Calling the mps to adopt a village and then work for its development, Modi said, ‚Äúwhatever party the mps belong to, they have to work for and among the people
 " Inspiring elected mps from urban parliamentary constituencies to adopt a village adjoining their city, the Prime Minister said, ‚Äúmps can choose any village in their state
 
 This scheme is not about money, but it is based on people and their participation
 " He said, "after independence, all governments have tried to eradicate poverty and develop rural India
 lekin yojanaayen badalte vakt ke anuroop honi chahie
 " modi ne kaha, "jab saansad apane gaanvon main kaam karenge to sabhi sarkari yojanaon kii kamiyaan saamne aaengi or vyavastha main parivartan hoga
 We need to create an environment in which people can be proud of their villages
 " He also said that the aspirations of the people of rural areas are not less than the aspirations of the people of urban areas from anywhere

 While participating in the Himachal Pradesh Assembly election campaign, Rahul Gandhi alleged that BJP is obstructing the way of Bills benefiting the common people
 unhone kaha ki samprag sarkaar ne bhrashtachar par lagaam lagane ke liye kade kadam uthaae hai
 Targeting the ruling party at the first election rally in the hill state, the Congress General Secretary alleged that the BJP was merely paving the way for the Bills introduced by the UPA government for the purpose of opposing it while the common man is being affected by it
 rahul ne kaha, ‚Äòsansad main ham jo bhi vidheyak laate hai, bhaajapa uskaa virodh karti he
 They do not talk, only oppose it
 unki soch hamen is tarah se rokna he taaki ham 2014 main satta main nahin aa sake, jaise ki ham 2004 or 2009 main satta main aae the
 Because they know that they can never win elections if the UPA government introduced the Right to Food and Land Bill
 ‚Äôrahul ne kaha, ‚Äòjin logon kii bhoomi adhigrahit kii gai he, unhen laabh pahunchane ke liye ham bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak laae hai taaki unhen jameen kii sahi keemat mil sake
 But the BJP Parliamentary Committee is obstructing the passage of the Bill
 ‚Äôunhone kaha, ‚Äòbhaajapa ise kheenchna chaah rahe hai
 They do not want the Bill
 ‚Äôcongress mahasachiv ne kaha, ‚Äòunhen koi chintaa nahin he lekin isse kise nuksaan hoga
 It is harming poor farmers

 He mentioned the achievements of the UPA government, the MNREGA, the Right to Food Bill, the Land Acquisition Bill, the loan waiver scheme of farmers and the RTI

 Yoga Guru Baba Ramdev says that after the surgical strike is over, the government should kill these terrorists
 unhone kaha ki daaud ibrahim, hafiz said, masood ajahar or salauddin ko unke ghar ke bheetar ghus kar maarna chahie
 Just before the UP elections, Ramdev says that the temple is a matter of faith, not a political issue
 is mudde ko aapas main baatcheet ke dwaara sulajhaa lenaa chahie
 Ram is secular
 inkaa kisi dharm or samudaay se nahin balki yah sabhi ke hai
 If Modi helps, he can give a fight to China - Ramdevramdev said about Chinese goods, that it is necessary to boycott Chinese goods, because enemies should get lessons
 chaahe vah vyapaaree ho, raajnneetik dal yaa phir koi or samooh, har tareeke se in par asar chhodana chahie
 Baba Ramdev said that he is willing to give his own option if there is a shortage of Chinese goods which were brought
 unhone kaha ki agar modi sarkaar unako madad karen to vah china ko takkar de sakate hai
 'modi must be given credit' Regarding the surgical strike, Baba Ramdev says that Modi should get credit for it because Modi was a political will
 chunki modi desh ke pradhanmantri hai isliye unako credit dene main koi raajnneeti nahin dekhni chahie
 When there is an issue of the country, everyone should support it
 ramdev ne kaha ki rahul gandhi kaa 'khun kii dallali' vaali baat thik nahin thi
 'film actors do not understand' Baba Ramdev said on Priyanka Chopra's statement of support of Pakistani artists that Pakistani artists should ban their films, serials, in every way
 jab desh kaa or raashtra kaa maamla he to usamen sab log ekamat hone chahie
 Because film actors who do acting, they do not understand much
 isliye aise muddon par filmi kalakaaron ko bolne se bachanaa chahie
 'ramdev will also bring under garments' Baba Ramdev said that he will not only bring jeans and shoes soon, but will also make other things of daily needs
 mahilaon ke liye saadiyaan chaahe vah garib varg, madhyam varg yaa phir apper class ke hi kyon na hon, unke liye banaaenge
 Under garments and other goods are also going to be launched in the market soon
 yah bahut vikrut sthiti he: dhaatu kii vishaal chimney or uske saath aapas main gutthamguttha pipeline, pipe or volve, use dekhne main dianasor se bhi doguna badsoorat bana dete hai
 When you come out of this place that looks like a factory, it looks like a river lying with garbage and vegetation wrapped around it
 mandir jaisi ek akruti, dadhakati chitaayen, jalte shavon se nikalati phufakaar jaisi awaajen, safed kafan main lipte shavon kii qatari
 a little upwards, looking at the sky, one can see the dome of a huge marble building that is eyeing death
 tajmahal tajganj shmashaan yaa mokshadham se maatr 100 meter kii duuri par he
 It is the largest crematorium in Agra
 do-ek sadhu idhar-udhar baithe hai, kuch langotadhari yuva kasarat kar rahe hai
 a frail old man is collecting remains of burnt human bodies in strange vessels
 bulldozer par savaar hokar ek vyaktis ek diwaar ko dhahaane kaa kaam shuru kar chukaa he, radio par kuch gunj rahaa he ‚Äòupavan ke liye ek rasta banaaya jayega
 They proudly tell foreigners who have come to see the cremation of Indian cremations that the line of dead bodies to be cremated here is never ending
 ve yahaan hone vaale antim sanskaar kii mahima or agra prashasan ke prayaason se sthapit nai ‚Äòparyaavaran anukool‚Äô ‚Äòbhatti‚Äô kaa bakhaan karte hai
 Do you regret that the smoke emanating from the crematorium is hurting the Taj Mahal, as soon as they leave, they reply, "when the government has no concern, why should we care?" Did not notice that is not right at all
 pichley do dashak main lagaataar koshishen chal rahi hai
 Files have moved from top to bottom in the Supreme Court's Confluence labyrinth-c gallery, in ministers' chambers, parliamentary committees and bureaucratic machinery
 1994 main varadarajan samiti ne shmashaan ghat ko sthanantarit karne kaa suzav diya to supreme court ne centre, upi sarkaar or agra prashasan se 1998, 2006 main or phir 2015 main bhi shmashaan ko kahin or sthanantarit karne ko kaha
 The stir escalated in July 2015 when a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment and Forests, in a report titled 'impact of Pollution on the Taj', noted that despite the Supreme Court's directives, "the authorities quietly defended the Taj"
 Permission to burn wood has continued in the vicinity of
 ‚Äô‚Äôkuch maheene baad sitambar 2015 main supreme court ke nyaayadhish courian joseph ne shmashaan ghat se nikalne vaale kaale dhuen se taj ko bachaane ke liye bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish ko patr likhaa
 But each time it was overthrown by arguing that it could create fierce anger among the local people
 2016 main supreme court ne agra prashasan se vaikalpik ‚Äòparyaavaran anukool‚Äô vyavastha khojane or shunya carbon utsarjan sunishchit karne ke liye bhi kaha tha
 Green endeavorsanjay Simhay used to work in a printing press
 aaj ve mokshadham main geele scrubar vaale chimney yukt vishaal incinarator par kaam karte hai or iskaa unhen garv he
 "it takes half an hour for a body," says Sanjay, very skilled in using switchboards and cruises
 ‚Äô‚Äô yah samay to bijli se chalane vaale shmashaan main shavadah ke liye lagane vaale 45 minute se bhi kam he or lakdi kii chintaa par hone vaale paaramparik shavadah ke 4-5 ghante se to kaaphi kam helekin kancreet ke un chaukor kuon kaa kya jo munh tak gande kaale taral se bhare hai? system se nikalne vaali yahi cheez to saare pradooshan kii jad he
 Where will it be left? The Agra municipal carriage takes away the dirty water and throws it away
 lekin antat: yah jaataa kahaan he? siwaron or naaliyon se hota yamuna main waapas pahunch jaataa he
 This is a technique in which the gases emanating from the crematorium are passed through a wet tube to reduce emissions of pollution in the atmosphere, so even if the smoke from here reaches the crown, it will not cause any damage to the marble
 agra ke ayukta pradeep bhatnagar ko ‚Äòparyaavaran anukool‚Äô shmashaan kaa yah vichaar dilli ke enjio mokshada green crimeshan system (mjisies) ko dekhakar aayaa tha
 "it is expected to reduce the amount of wood currently required for cremation to one-quarter," he says
 lakdi puri tarah se jal jaaegi, dhuaan kam nikalegaa or pradooshan ko nunatam rakhaa jayega
 "in America, where a movement to make death ecologically less harmful has gained momentum, carbon monoxide, soot and other fine particles emitted from the human body are also burned using wet scrubbers
" Emission of harmful particles (particulate matter) cannot be stopped

 But the Agra Development Authority has installed four large chimneys
 harek kii laagat lagbhag 38 lakh ru
 Stated, although only one of these chimneys is operational
 chaar or chimaniyaan lagaai jaani hai jiskaa kaam ‚Äòkorporate diwaliyapan samaadhaan prakriya se shuru kii gai‚Äô tag vaali ushar agro limited ko diya gaya he
 The Agra Development Authority never met its deadline for installing 'green' chimneys
 kya isse kaam ho paaegaa?paroapkaar ke kaary1885 se hi kapadaa vyapaariyon kaa ek sanghathan kshetra bajaaja samiti (kabs) agra ke logon ke liye ek badi seva de rahaa he
 "in 133 years, 133 lakh bodies have been cremated in Mokshadham, Agra," says committee chairman Sunil Vikal
 aisi vyavastha shaayad hi kisi ne pehle kahin dekhi ho
 Here everything happens under one roof, people from every caste, every class come and we give full service related to the funeral without profit and loss
 sanskrit main kshetra kaa arth sthaniyata se lagaaya jaataa he or bajaaja urdu kaa shabd he jiskaa matlab kapadaa vyapaaree hota he
 Even today, a member of KBS can only be a textile businessman
 ‚Äô‚Äô1985 main ek rashtriya sanghathan ke sadsy tajganj shmashaan kii surat sanvaarane aae
 The banks of the Yamuna were full of mud, there was no electricity and people used to bring dead bodies on their shoulders
 unke pita satya prakaash vikal jo ki bhaajapa kii pehali sarkaar main saat vibhaagon ke mantri rahe hai, is kshetra ke kaddavar vyakti the or aresas-jansangh main unki gahari paith thi
 While the Supreme Court was trying to close or move the crematorium, KBS was busy making its service more efficient and accessible
 murdagadipoon ke bede, freezrayukt fibre glass ke taabut, apana shavgrih, yahaan jalaae gaye agyaat shavon ke avasheshon ko unke rishtedaaron ke liye surakshit rakhane kii vyavastha karnaa, aadhyatmik kriyaaon or sabhaaon kaa aayojan tathaa logon ko shmashaan par ek din bitaane ke liye aamantrit karne jaise kaary kabs ne kiye hai
 "there's nothing like being scared in a crematorium," says Vikal
 ‚Äô‚Äôvikal jor dekar kehete hai ki sarkaar ne agra ke logon ke antim sanskaar ke liye kuch bhi nahin kiya he
 "we have made this place beautiful with gardens," he says
 yah shmashaan ghat pehle bahut hi bhayaavah sthiti main tha
 Why did the government not do this? Kshetra Bajaja Committee has done everything
 hamane yah sara kaam sarkaar se bina ek rupaya liye puraa kiya he
 Today the Agra Authority is looking to acquire it
 ‚Äô‚Äôvikal iske bhavishya ko lekar khush nahin dikhte
 But they insist that Mokshadham stays here or is taken away somewhere, it will all depend on the 'will of the people'
 itihaas main jaakar dekhen to unki baat bahut galat nahin lagati
 In 1999, when the Supreme Court directed the Agra Development Authority and the Agra Municipal Corporation to relocate the crematorium, activists, protesters along with religious groups also came out in their support
 2015 main bhi jab agra prashasan ne shmashaan ko sthanantarit karne ke bare main baat kerani shuru kii to iske virodh main hinduvadi yuva sanghathanon ne kai dinon tak sadakon par virodh-pradarshan kiya
 Among the arguments made by the members of the pollution-prone Bajaja Committee from the crematorium on their behalf in the Supreme Court is: "on what basis are you saying that we are damaging the Taj Mahal? Has anyone proved how much pollution we produce? ‚Äùit is true that no iit-kanpur scientist spent time here, whereas he spent a lot of time in the Taj
 eniiarai (neshnal anvyranmental ejineering research institute, nagpur) kii bhi koi aisi report nahin daakhil kii gai he jo yah bataati ho ki ve taj kii ore kitna pradooshan bhej rahe hai
 The Supreme Court will also have to answer all these things
 haalanki, desh ke kai anya hisson main shmashaan se nikalne vaale vaayu pradooshan ke str par adhyayan kiye gaye hai or unase hi kuch anumaan mil jate hai
 a joint study was conducted by the Central Pollution Control Board, New Delhi and NEERI on emissions from all sources in Mumbai
 uskaa naam diya gaya tha ‚Äòmumbai mahanagar, vaayu gunvattta akalan, utsarjan suchi or strot aavanton adhyayan‚Äô
 That study can also help in understanding pollution levels
 shmashaan se jo pradooshak kan nikalate the unamem mukhya rup se piem 10, carbon monooxide (sio), hydrocarbon (echsi), sulfur dioxide (esao2), or nitrogen oxide (enoex) paae gaye the
 Among the various sources that were studied, a large amount of CO emissions were found in the air from the crematorium, which was much lower than the pollution emanating from vehicles considered to be the main sources of emissions, but from the burning of garbage in the open Was close to emission
 jahaan tak hydrocarbon (echesi) kaa prashn he, khule main jalane vaale kachare se zyada echsi kaa utsarjan shmashaan main paaya gaya tha
 There was also a considerable impact on the level of PM in the environment around them
 adhyayan main suzav diya gaya ki shavadah ke dauraan sharir se nikalne vaale pradooshak tatwon kaa utsarjan kam karne ke liye vidyut shmashaan, acchhee vyavastha or chimney ke upyog main vruddhi, vidyut shavadahgrih kii tarah kisi band bhatthi main alpiji burner ke sambhavit upyog kii sambhaavnaaen talashne, utsarjan ke liye kushal piem niyantrak upayon (jaise bag filter yaa chakravaat) kaa prabandh hona chahie
 Global studies show that cremation also emits various organic pollutants that pollute the atmosphere as well as mercury
 vastav main, shmashaanon se hone vaale paara utsarjan kii andekhi nahin honi chahie
 The funeral pyre is about five crematoriums in the city of Agra and all are within a radius of about 10 km of the Taj
 mokshadham to taj ke itane kareeb he ki samay-samay par taj ke upar isse nikalne vaale dhuen kaa gheraa bhi dikhataa he
 The other cremation grounds - Poia, Balkeshwar, Kailash and Malik Chautra - are wood-based
 baleshwar main do vidyut shavadah grih bhi hai, jo mokshadham parisar main hai
 In the city of Agra, private, religious or charitable agencies in various crematoriums do the work of the government, although the Municipal Corporation of Agra does not accept any 'certificate of cremation', except for Mokshadham for the purposes of preparing a death certificate
 praathmik surveykshan or shmashaan adhikariyon ke saath baatcheet ke aadhaar par yah nishkarsh nikaala gaya he ki mrit shariron ko jalaane ke liye ausatan lagbhag 300 kilogram lakdi or 3 litre (2
 43 kg) of kerosene is required
 baatcheet or shmashaan ke kai chakkar lagane ke baad aisa prathit hua ki mokshadham main lagbhag 12 se 25 shavon ko paramparaagat tareeke se jalaakar hi antim sanskaar kiya jaataa he
 Only two to three dead bodies (especially unclaimed corpses) visit the electric crematorium
 agra ke log zyaadaatar lakdi aadhaarit shmashaan kaa upyog karnaa pasand karte hai, haalanki vidyut shavadah ni:shulk he
 Except for Mokshadham, where 20 to 25 dead bodies arrive daily, most of the crematoriums do not keep any record of the bodies being brought daily
 virodhabhasi davejahaan sangrakshanvaadi shmashaan ghar se nikalne vaale dhuen ko tajmahal ke liye bade khatre ke rup main dekhte hai
 At the same time, groups supporting the Moksha Dham crematorium ghats claim that the crematorium has no role in air pollution around the Taj

 His youngest partner in the field, Sanam Singh, was born when Paes started his game in 1991
 apane 22 saal ke kariyar main ve 14 grand slam samet 53 dubles khitaab jeet chuke hai
 During this time he has played with 115 partners, including 94 men and 21 women

 'input: IANS Taking a major decision in the real estate sector, the National Housing Bank (NHB) has banned the interest subvention scheme of housing finance companies
 enechabi ne aisi yojanaon main frod ko rokane ke liye yah kadam uthaaya he, lekin isse lakhon kharidaaron ke liye sankat khadaa ho saktaa he
 Not only this, it will also make it very difficult for the real estate sector, which is already troubled by the fund crunch
 apane nae circular main NHB ne home finance companiyon se kaha he ki aise lone utpaada dena band karen jisamen graahak kii jagah lone kaa byaaj develper detaa he yani instrate kaa subvension kiya jaataa he
 Housing finance companies are regulated by NHB (though, according to the budget proposal, this will also be given to the Reserve Bank) and the home loan of the banks is regulated by the Reserve Bank
 kya hoti he subvension skiasal main subvension skim ke tahat builder '5:95' or '10:90' jaisi lubhaavni yojanaon kii peshkash karte hai
 Under this, the customer gets to book the flat by paying only 5 or 10 percent down payment of the cost of the flat and the loan of the remaining 80 to 90 percent of this flat is available
 lone kii yah raashi kai hisson main builder ko mil jaati he or makaan ke puraa banane tak is par jo byaaj aata he yani har maheene iemai uskaa bhugtan builder hi kar detaa he
 The advantage to the builder is that even on paying EMI, this fund is cheaper, because the interest on the home loan is less than 9 per cent, while the builder has to pay a lot of interest when taking a loan from outside
 duusari taraf, graahak ko phayda yah he ki maamuli rakam main flats book ho jaataa he or jab tak pajeshan nahin miltaa use iemai ke boj se bhi mukti rahati he
 But in such schemes many builders commit fraud or when a project gets stuck, then both builder and customer are in trouble
 enechabi ne kaha he ki uskaa yah aadesh pehle se chalane vaale subvension skim par bhi lagu hoga
 According to the circular, the builders who are already running such schemes will now have to shift to the construction linked payment plan
 houseing companiyaan develper ko kisi project ke nirmaan ke mutabik hi raashi jari karenge
 This will prevent misuse of loans
 enechabi kaa jor realty projects ko samay se puraa karaane par he

 saal ke is samay main dilli kii yamuna main yamunotri kii ek boond bhi nahin hoti
 If only Delhi's sewage, urine and sewage wastes
 isliye yamuna ke tathakthith pani ko modakar jab ise bhar diya gaya to bhi yah yamuna ke pani kaa nahin, siver ke pani se bana abhayaarany banakar rah gaya
 This is just an incident, which can be understood that due to the river Yamuna, which settled the city of Delhi or Indraprastha or Shahjahanabad, the city and country and the government of the state are very careless about that river
 dilli main yamuna lagaataar sikudti or patali hoti ja rahi he
 In addition to the rain, in the remaining months, it flows in the shape of a stream in a thin stream of 100 meters
 supreme court kii ucchadhikaar samiti ne nadi kaa jalpravaah 10 cubic meter prati second (kusek) rakhane kii sifarish kii thi, jis par kabhi amal nahin kiya gaya
 In the rainy season, the land is running low due to its flow and spreading of water
 insaani laalach or sarkari laaparvaahee ne isse uski kaaphi jameen chin lee he
 According to the data, 292 acres of Yamuna land in Delhi is no longer its own and all kinds of constructions have been done on it
 or laalach kii yah ginati abhi puri nahin hui he
 If Yamraj's sister got angry? Yamuna robbery is not yet an issue in Delhi
 shahar or shahar ke log ise lekar ‚Äò‚Äòchalata he‚Äô‚Äô vaale andaaj main hai
 When there is a sense of carelessness in the country and society, then who cares? lekin is saal june main uttarakhand main jo hua, usne tamaam toun plansrs or paryaavarnavidon ke bich khatre kii ghanti baja di he
 When the rivers that form the Ganges, including Mandakini, Alaknanda and Bhagirathi, suddenly got a lot of water, the rivers took back the land they had always owned and occupied by humans over the last few decades 
 nadiyaan umadin or apane pravaah maarg par banaae gaye ghar, hotel or tamaam dhaanchon ko bahaakar le gayi
 If someday it happened in Yamuna, Delhi, which had been razed seven times, would probably be eighth time in its history
 dilli to uttarakhand ke ulat ghani aabaadi vaala kshetra he
 It is difficult to imagine how many lakhs of people would be devastated if Yamuna withdrew his land overnight
 vaise bhi yamuna ko hindu dharamshastron main yamraj kii bahan mana gaya he
 After independence, there were heavy floods in 1966, 1978, 1988, 1995, 1998 and in the 21st century in 2010 and 2013
 is saal june main uttarakhand main jal pralay ke kaaran jab himalay se nikalne vaali sari nadiyon kaa jal str badha to dilli main bhi 18-20 june ko jal str itnaa bad gaya ki osmanpur gaanv, sonia vihaar, gadhi mandi, shastri park or tibeti bazaar main pani bhar gaya or logon ko yahaan se hataakar raahat shiviron main pahunchaa diya gaya
 In addition, areas like Model Town, Nigambodh Ghat, Yamuna Bazar, Rajghat, Batla House and Madanpur Khadar started to be flood prone
 dilli kii shila dikshit sarkaar or noida prashasan ne sthiti par lagaataar najar rakhi, lekin kisi ne yah nahin jataayaa ki ye saare ilaake nadi ko god main aabaad hai or nadi main pani ko baadh nahin kah sakate
 Loot in Delhi, the first city to be built over the devastated river in haryana-up and to save long-troubled Delhi, are other states now being flooded? The agitators associated with the Yamuna say that the river has to flow and if its route is narrowed, then the river water will definitely create back flow (upstream), which will create pressure on both the upper and lower sides of the river
 Parts will remain flood prone
 yamuna kshetra kii jameen par kabja karne kii hode ne ab upree hisse yani uttar pradesh ke bagpat, saharanpur jaise yamuna ke tatavarti kshetron ko bankerast bana diya he
 It can be seen with open eyes that the embankments that Yamuna is being encircled in Delhi are very strong, while the Yamuna embankments in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are quite thin and weak
 isliye dilli ke tatbandh kabhi nahin tuutate, jabaki haryana or uttar pradesh ke tatbandh har saal tut jate hai or lakhon jindagiyon ko prabhavit karte hai
 If the sudden water in the rain will be stopped somewhere, then the water will find its way
 aisa lagata he ki dilli ke laalach kii keemat haryana or upi ko bhi lambey samay tak chukaani hogi
 Things may change but is it possible
 yamuna lut gai mandir ke namadilli main yamuna par atikaraman jhuggi-jhonpadi waalon ne yaa avaidh coloniyon ne nahin kiya he ki sarkaar aasaani se bulldozer chalaa degi
 This violation has been done by the influential institutions of the country
 unamem sabase prabhaavshaalee sanstha he-dharm
 In recent years, the biggest example of encroachment in Yamuna's lap is the Akshardham Temple
 varsh 2000 main centre kii endie sarkaar ne akshardham mandir ko jameen dena shuru kiya or abhi mandir parisar ke paas kul 47 hectare (116 acre) jameen he
 In the question asked under RTI, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) gave the Bochswasi Mr
 Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS) 23
 5 hectare jameen kii hi keemat 37
 5 crores Rs
 bataai he
 The rest 23
 5 hectare (58 acre) jameen jo awaas or parking aadi ke liye di gai, uski keemat kaa zikr tak nahin he
 While the then market price of that land was also in billions of rupees
 ek dashak se real estate kansaltent kaa kaam kar rahe gaurav pi
 According to Malhotra, since the land of Yamuna region is completely under government, its market value can only be estimated
 akshardham mandir se dakshini dilli, conot place, bahari ring road or metro kii connactivity behtareen he
 Malhotra claims, "the real estate market was not booming in 2000, but in view of the spurt in Delhi property prices after sealing in 2005 and 2007, it was priced at least twenty-two billion rupees per acre
" banati he
 The basis of Malhotra's claim is the documentation of property fluctuations in the last 10 years

 But these are completely optional
 ‚Äô‚Äôlut ke liye badla master plansanthganth kaa hi nateeja he ki yamuna nadi kshetra main atikaraman ke liye sarkaar ne master plan 2001 main krishi or pani kshetra vaali jameen kaa land yuj badalakar plan 2021 main saarvajanik or arddh saarvajanik suvidhaon ke liye kar diya
 India Today has documents from RTI in this regard, but no one is willing to tell who and why they decided to make agriculture and aquatic land a public land
 dharmik gatividhiyon ke liye yamuna kshetra main jameen dene ke tatkaaleen sarkaar ke makasad par gandhivadi anupam mishra maujuun tippanee karte hai, ‚Äò‚Äòjameen lutaaney ke maamle main koi sarkaar peeche nahin he
 The party that talks about Sanskar did the same thing
 jab aap yamuna ko devi maanate hai to usee kii god main ek or devtaa kii kya jarurat thi
 Says Nitya Jacob, director of the water program at the Center for Science and Environment (CSE), "after Akshardham, there is an open leeway to grab land
" lalakila ke paas jitna slam yamuna sangrakshan ke naam par hataaya gaya, usase doguna to sarkari atikaraman yamuna kshetra main ho chukaa he
 "but the glow of the Akshardham temple management is such that when the government planned to establish a commonwealth village on the land of Yamuna next to the same temple in 2007, the temple organization protested this construction
" sansad main die sawaal ke jawaab main upie sarkaar ke tatkaaleen khel or panchayat raaj mantri manishankar ayyar ne 10 may, 2007 ko kabuula he, ‚Äò‚Äòjahaan tak sambhav tha, didie ne mandir prabandhan kii jo chintaaen or aapattiyaan thim uskaa nivaaran kiya
 The government reduced the height of the residential multi-storey buildings in the Commonwealth Village due to temple management
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki khud yamuna kshetra main atikaraman kaa doshi akshardham mandir prabandhan kya itnaa shaktishaalee he ki vah kisi or nirmaan ke sarkari nirnay ko dictate kar sake?khud 2011 main tatkaaleen kendriya paryaavaran mantri jairam ramesh ne kaha tha, ‚Äò‚Äòakshardham ne paryaavaran kii manjuuri ke liye na to aavedan diya or na use manjuuri di gai thi
 "but Dave, the main PRO of Akshardham Temple, argues," After getting the land from the DDA, we worked with all the permissions required in 2001-02
 kuch chijen baad main hamaare saamne ai to ham sambandhit athurity ke paas gaye
 But we do not want to comment on the statements of politicians
 ‚Äô‚Äô kaamanwealth village kii imaaraton kii oonchai kam karaane ke sawaal par dave kehete hai, ‚Äò‚Äòham kisi sarkari athurity ko chunauti nahin de sakate, sirf anurodh kar sakate hai
 "after Akshardham, loot could be looted, so looting should be allowed to encroach into the Yamuna region, but the land grab of Yamuna started by building a bridge in the name of development
 yamuna jiye abhiyaan ke sanyojak manoj kumaar mishra bataate hai, ‚Äò‚Äòpuraane pul or metro pul ko chhodkar yamuna par banaae gaye saare pul nakli hai jinhen chhadam pul kaha jaataa he, jinamein nadi ke chote se pravaah ke donon ore pillar banaae gaye hai, lekin nadi kaa baaki hissaa baandh ke rup main dikhataa he
 The encroachment began as a bridge intensified the land grab and the city entered the river
 ‚Äô‚Äô nadi kshetra main ek bada atikaraman 1982 main asian games ke liye bane players hostel se hua jo ab dilli sachivalay he
 After that Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium was formed
 phir 1998 main pehla bada atikaraman shastri park metro ko di gai jameen (16
 60 hectares), where Metro depots, IT parks and residential buildings were built
 iske baad kaamanwealth village ke liye 59 hectare, yamuna bank metro depo ke liye 36 hectare, gita colony brij ke liye 49 hectare, dilli traansco limited ko 16 hectare
 Sewer treatment plants, CRPF, police training camps, crematoriums and all the burial places were set up in the Yamuna area
 aankadon ke mutabik ab tak yamuna kii kareeb 292 hectare se zyada jameen par sarkari atikaraman ho chukaa he
 Apart from this, Sonia vihar-jahangirpuri line under Metro Phase-4, New Wazirabad connecting Salimgarh Fort to Velodrum Road, New Alignment, east-west Corridor, Sarai Kale khan-mayur Vihar Metro Line, etc
 are among the proposed schemes which encroach on Yamuna
 Are ready to speed up yamuna nadi jone main jitani bachi hui jagah he, use o jone (surakshit jone) kaha jaataa he jo kareeb 9,700 hectare main failaa he
 The government now wants to exclude half of this zone
 lekin paryaavaranvaadi or sangrakshanvaadi iskaa kadaa virodh kar rahe hai
 Actually, this new initiative of the government is doubtful
 yamuna ke aadhe hisse ko o jone se baahar karne par jameen hadapney kii chhot mil jaaegi
 Gandhian Anupam Mishra says, "these people (government) will convert the river into a canal that will generate 800-1000 hectares of prime land
" dilli ne is tarah yamuna se jyaadati kii to nadi is shahar ko barbaad kar degi
 We have to understand that Yamuna is Delhi, not Delhi's Yamuna
 ‚Äô‚Äôtamilnadu se lijie jaankaree?akshardham mandir ke nirmaan ke bare main jab india today ne dilli vikaas praadhikaran (didie) se lekar paryaavaran mantralay tak soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat jaankariyaan maangin to aavedan par jawaab kam, use ghumaya zyada gaya
 Three applications under RTI were sent to DDA and three to Union Ministry of Environment
 paryaavaran evam van mantralay se poocha gaya tha ki akshardham mandir kii sanstha bochasanvasi shri akshar purushottam ne kya koi clearence kii maang kii thi? or kisne clearence di? mantralay (1e-3 divijan) se jawaab mila ki kisne clearence di, isaki koi jaankaree uplabdh nahin he
 In this regard, this Ministry was asked how much area catchment of Yamuna has been declared in Delhi, was there any change in it
 is sambandh main jan soochna adhikari, neshnal river conjarveshan diarectorat ne jal sansaadhan mantralay (ganga wing) ko aavedan patr bhej diya
 From there, the letter was sent to the Upper Yamuna River Board, to which no response was received
 aavedan ko mantralay ke kshetreey karyaalay (madhya kshetra) lakhanu bhi bheja gaya
 From there came the reply of the Chief Conservator of Forest that no proposal of transferring the forest land to his office was received, so there is no question of granting approval
 aavedan chandigarh ke kshetreey karyaalay ke saath-saath tamilnadu sarkaar ke mukhya van sangrakshak ko bhi bheja gaya
 Delhi Pollution Control Committee, Environment Department said on the application that came here that this matter is not of its department
 dilli ke sinchai-baadh niyantran vibhaag ne kisi dastavej ke uplabdh hone se hi inkaar kar diya
 Obviously, the government has less to tell and more to hide

 The former Bihar minister and elder son of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, who stayed away from his family and politics for a few days on the issue of divorce with his wife, was in the party chief's chamber on Monday
 Hearing the problems of the people who came to the party office by holding Janata Durbar
 is maukey par unhone kaha ki agar party ke netritv kaa avasar diya gaya to, main peeche nahin hatoonga
 Dismissing speculation of differences with his younger brother and former Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, Tej Pratap termed it as propaganda and said that he started organizing the Janata Darbar as a public representative and party leader to listen to public problems And will continue it regularly
 unhone kaha ki unke pita lalu yadav bhi aise hi apane paas aae logon se milakar unki fariyaad suna kiya karte the
 When asked about the discussion of younger brother Tejashwi to make the state the Chief Minister and engaged in efforts to take charge of the party himself, Tej Pratap called it wrong and rumored
 yah puche jane ki agar unhen party kii kaman saunpi jaati he to kya vah use sweekaar karenge, tejpratap ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòagar hamen aisa mauka miltaa he or argedy pramukh lalu prasad hamen yah jimmedaar saunptein hai to ham use jarur nibhaayenge
 It will not back down
 ‚Äô‚Äôunhone aage kaha ki party sabhi ke sahyog se chalati he

 Party spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy said, "if the Center is considering giving special status to Bihar, then it should not mix it with any of its strategy of staying in power
" ‚Äôunhone kaha, 'congress nit kendra sarkaar ne bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene ke bare main vichaar kaa jo samay chunaa he, usase kuch shaq paidaa hota he
 Suspicion is arising that due to being in minority, what chair does she want to save in the name of giving something to some weak states
 'unhone kaha kibihar ko vanchit rajya ke darje se ubarne ke liye vishesh rajya ke darje kii jarurat helekin congress kendra kii satta main bane rahane ke liye iskaa raajnneetik istemaal nahin kare
 Asked whether the BJP feared that its important constituent of the NDA might go with the JDU UPA, Rudy did not give a direct answer saying that after the next Lok Sabha elections, the BJP government will form at the Center and Nitish Kumar ( Chief Minister of Bihar) will accompany
 is sawaal par ki bhaajapa ko shaq he ki nitish bhaajapa kaa saath chhod sakate hai, rudi ne ise taalte hue kaha, ‚Äòyah prashn prasangik nahin he
 BJP and JDU have a strong government in Bihar
 ‚Äôyah puche jane par ki kya kendra sarkaar ko bachaane ke liye congress‚Äòbihar card‚Äôkhel rahi or kya is prayaas main use bhaajapa ke sahyogi dal jadyu kaa saath mil saktaa he
 Rudy said, 'congress is making a lot of unsuccessful efforts
 basapa, sapa or dramuk kaa samarthan paane ke liye vah sibiai kaa prayog kar rahi he
 But now she is completely smitten
 ab vah zyada din bachane vaali nahin he
 Nitish Kumar spoke to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Finance Minister p Chidambaram and Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia last week about registering a special state for Bihar
 is baatcheet ke baad unhone kaha tha ki pradhanmantri ke saath bhent ke baad unhen badi ummid bandhi he ki is mudde ko aage badhaayaa jayega
 Rudy also objected to calling Bihar a 'backward state' and said that it is completely unfair to say so
 unhone kaha ki10 karod kii aabaadi vaala bihar pichhadaa rajya nahin balki ‚Äòvanchit rajya'he
 After the separation of Jharkhand, Bihar was deprived of national development

 According to the world's leading smartphone maker Samsung, the next version Android will be named Android 7
 isse pehle ise Android Nutella or Nugget ke taur par bhi dekha ja rahaa tha

 But when Devendra Fadnavis will be swearing in as CM on Friday evening at the Wankhede Stadium, it is very likely that the eclipse of Shiv Sena will change the color of lotus
 shapath grahan samaaroh main hissaa lene ko lekar shivasena ne spasht kah diya he ki jahaan sammaan nahin vahaan kyon jaaen
 That is, in 25 years of alliance, the equation of CM construction on the condition of brokenness also did not work ointment
