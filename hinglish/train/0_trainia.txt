 In the by-elections in Bihar, there is a tussle between the parties of the Grand Alliance
 khaskar bhabhua main hone vaale upachunaav ko lekar argedy or congress aamane-saamne hai
 RJD has already announced that it will field its candidates for the by-elections in three seats in Bihar
 congress ko arriya loksabhaa or jahanabad vidhansabha ko lekar koi dikkat nahin he, lekin wo bhabhua seat kisi keemat par chhodana nahin chaahati he
 This seat was in the account of Janata Dal u in the 2015 assembly elections, but BJP won
 ab janata dal you mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa nahin he
 Therefore, the Congress is claiming this seat
 congress ke varisht netaa sadanand singh kaa kahana he ki pichley chunaav main bhabhua seat par na to argedy khadi thi or na congress
 In such a situation, given the political situation there, this seat should go to the Congress account, because Congress has won seven times before here, while RJD has won this seat only twice
 samaajik sameekaran ke hisaab se yah seat congress ko shoot karata he, aise main yah seat congress ko hi milanaa chahie
 However, RJD has also finalized candidates for all three seats
 argediki rashtriya upaadhyaksh rabari devi ne party kii sansadeey board kii baithak main kaha ki hamane teenon seat par ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 No one has come to talk on behalf of the Congress
 unhen baat karne aana chahie
 But the question arises that when there is no dialogue between the parties of the Grand Alliance, how did the RJD finally announce the candidates for all the three seats? The Congress is well aware that if this time it does not fight for the Bhabhua seat, So he may have to bear the brunt of this in the coming election
 isliye usne apane rukh main talkhi laai he or kaha he ki agar use bhabhua seat nahin mili, to wo teenon siton par ummidavaar utaar sakati he
 On the other hand, RJD wants Congress to contest only Bhabhua seat, as it will benefit from it
 bhabhua seat brahman bahul kshetra he
 In such a situation, if the Congress picks its candidate from here, then bjp's vote will be cut and RJD will benefit from it, but if the Congress fielded in the Araria Lok Sabha by-election, then the loss of RJD is certain

 He is not even close to Kohli
 vah apni alag lig kaa hissaa he
 Everyone likes the way he leads the innings
 achche ballebaaj kii sabase acchhee cheez yah he ki vah apni pari kii gati ko niyantran main rakhata he or kohli aasaani se aisa karata he
 Surely it will be better
 ' Richards scored more than 500 runs in four Tests in the only Test series against Australia before South Africa had been away from international cricket for 21 years

 Vandana had no idea that IAS result is going to come
 lekin is sarprise se zyada bada sarprise abhi uskaa intjaar kar rahaa tha
 Looking at the list of toppers, suddenly his eyes stopped at number eight
 aathvin rank
 Name- Vandana
 role number-029178
 Repeatedly mixing names and roll numbers and trying to convince myself that this is me
 haa, vah vandana hi thi
 a 24-year-old girl who secured eighth position in the Indian Civil Services Examination 2012 and first place through Hindi medium
 vandana kii ankhon main intervyuu kaa din gum gaya
 a very slim girl of average height in a light purple color saree arrived in the UPSC building for an interview
 shuru main thodaa dar laga tha, lekin phir aadhe ghante tak chale intervyuu main har sawaal kaa aatmavishvaas or himmat se saamana kiya
 Vandana was happy to get out
 lekin us din bhi ghar lautakar unhone aaraam nahin kiya
 Picked up the books and started preparing for the next IAS exam
 yah rigelt vandana ke liye to aashcharya hi tha
 This was the first attempt
 koi koching nahin, koi gidence nahin
 Nobody is going to teach, understand, tell
 iees kii taiyaari kar rahaa koi dost nahin
 Even Vandana never went out of her house to buy a book
 kisi tapasvi sadhu kii tarah ek saal tak apane kamare main band hokar sirf or sirf padhati raheen
 They do not know the way to their home and even the streets of the locality properly
 koi ghar kaa rasta puche to ve nahin bataa paatin
 Like Arjun, Vandana only knows the eye of the bird
 ve kahati hai, ‘‘bas, yahi thi meri manzil
 Vandana was born on April 4, 1989, in a very traditional family in Nasrullagarh village, Haryana
 unke ghar main ladakiyon ko padhaane kaa chalan nahin tha
 No girl from her first generation went to school
 vandana kii shuruaati padhai bhi gaanv ke sarkari skool main hui
 Vandana's father Mahipal Singh Chauhan says, "the school in the village was not good
 isliye apane bade ladke ko maine padhgaye ke liye baahar bheja
 Just since that day, Vandana too had the same rote
 mujhe kab bhejoge padhgaye
 Mahipal Singh says that initially i also thought that there is a girl, what is the need to teach more
 lekin medhaavi bitiyaa kii lagan or padhai ke jazbe ne unhen majaboor kar diya
 Vandana said angrily to her father one day, "I am a girl, so i am not sending me to study
" ’’ mahipal singh kehete hai, ‘‘bas, yahi baat mere kaleje main chubh gai
 i thought i would send the daughter out to read
 ’’chhathi class ke baad vandana muradabad ke paas ladakiyon ke ek gurukul main padhgaye chali gai
 The rules there were very strict
 kade anushaasan main rahanaa padataa
 One had to wash his own clothes, clean the room and even help him cook twice a month
 haryana ke ek pichde gaanv se beti ko baahar padhgaye bhejne kaa faisla mahipal singh ke liye bhi aasaan nahin tha
 Vandana's grandfather, Taya, uncle and all the family men were against this decision
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘maine sabakaa gussa jhela, sabaki najaron main bura bana, lekin apana faisla nahin badla
 Vandana's floor was fixed only after tenth
 us umr se hi ve comptitive megsine main toppers ke intervyuu padhatin or uski kating apane paas rakhti
 She made a list of books
 kabhi bhai se kahkar to kabhi online kitaaben mangavathi
 After studying in Gurukul till the twelfth, Vandana studied law at home
 kabhi college nahin gai
 Dad used to take him to take the exam as well
 gurukul main siikhaa hua anushaasan ek saal taiyaari ke dauraan kaam aayaa
 She used to study for about 12-14 hours everyday
 neend aane lagati to chalate-chalate padhati thi
 Mithilesh, Vandana's mother, says, "the whole summer Vandana did not allow the room to be cooled
 kahati thi, thandak or aaraam main neend aati he
 "vandana used to study in heat and sweat so that she could not sleep
" ek saal tak ghar ke logon ko bhi uske hone kaa abhas nahin tha
 As if he is not present in the house
 kisi ko use disturb karne kii ijaajat nahin thi
 Neither did the elder brother's three-year-old daughter
 vandana ke saath-saath ghar ke sabhi log civil seva pariksha kii taiyaari kar rahe the
 He was the same world
 iees nahin to kya? ‘‘kuch nahin
 Never thought of any other option
 ’’ vandana kii vahi duniya thi
 Same dream and same destination
 unhone baahar kii duniya kabhi dekhi hi nahin
 Never stepped outside Haryana
 kabhi cinema haul main koi film nahin dekhi
 Never eaten in any park and restaurant
 kabhi doston ke saath party nahin kii
 Never had a boyfriend
 kabhi manapsand genes-sandals kii shopping nahin kii
 Now that the floor has been found, Vandana wants to fulfill all her wishes
 ghudsawaari karnaa chaahati he or nishanebaaji siikhnaa chaahati he
 Desire to roam a lot
 aaj gaanv ke vahi saare log, jo kabhi ladki ko padhata dekh munh bichakaaya karte the, vandana kii safalataa par garv se bhare hai
 Saying, "girls must teach
" bitiyaa padhegi to naam raushan karegi
 Mahipal Singh's eyes fill up while saying this
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘ladki jaat kii bahut bekadri hui he
 Always kept them pressed
 padhgaye nahin diya
 Now these people should get a chance
 ’’ mauka milane par ladki kya kar sakati he, vandana ne karke dikhaa hi diya he
 The fourth generation of victims of the gas accident in the capital of Madhya Pradesh, 31 years ago, is also suffering the ill effects
 alam yah he ki ek lakh kii aabaadi main dhai hajaar se zyada bachche vikruti kaa shikaar hai, inamen 17 sau bachche janmajaat vikruti kaa shikaar paae gaye hai
 This possibility has come to light in a study of trust clinics
 gas kandake peediton or pradooshit bhoojal prabhaviton ko muft ilaaj dene vaale sambhaavna clinics ne haal hi main 20 hajaar se zyada pariwaron ke ek lakh se adhik logon par adhyayan puraa kiya he
 The study conducted on four similarly populated communities includes 84 people affected by gas, affected by polluted groundwater, affected and unaffected by both gas and polluted groundwater
 janm se hi bacchon main aa rahi he vikrutipichley teen saalon main clinics ke shodhakarmiyon ne chikitsak dwaara pramanit tibi, cancer, lakva, mahilaon kaa prajnan swasthya tathaa shishuon or bacchon kii shaareerik, maansik va saamaajik vikaas kii jaankaree ikattha kii he
 Prospect researchers have identified more than 2500 such children, possibly with congenital malformation, in this population
 itnaa hi nahin, desh ke alag-alag hisson se aae 30 chikitsakon ne 1700 se adhik bacchon ko janmajaat vikruti se grast paaya he
 The study's field co-ordinator, Ritesh Pal, released the details of the research on Tuesday, stating that preliminary observations have revealed that the rate of congenital malformations is higher in the population affected by green gas or polluted groundwater than the untreated population
 unhone kaha ki agle chah maheene main adhyayan ke nattejey antarrashtriya str par jari kiye jaaenge
 All the help for the treatment of the children, Afreen, a colleague of Ritesh Pal, said that they have not only gathered information about the deformity of the children, but are also helping in providing treatment to such children
 unke mutabik, ab tak mandabuddhi, cerebral palsy, (andkosh kii vikruti), sindectili-palitactili (ungaliyon kii vikruti) or anya janmajaat vikrutiyon vaale 164 bacchon ko ilaaj ke liye sarkari or gaiyr sarkari chikitsa kendron main bheja ja chukaa he
 Treatment of 43 of these children has been completed
 sambhaavna trust clinics main gas peedit evam kaarkaane ke paas rahane vaale pradooshit bhoojal peedit 31 hajaar se zyada log panjikrut hai
 In this clinic, integrated treatment is given through allopathy, Ayurveda and Yoga
 clinics ko chalaane ke liye bharat or britain ke 15 hajaar se adhik log aarthik madad karte hai
 In addition, international authors raise funds for gynecology clinics and informal schools run by Dominic Lepier Chance
 haq kii ladaai main bichhude 20 hajaar sathibhopal ke gas peediton ke haq ke liye sangharsh kar unhen swaavlambee banane main jute hue abdul jabbaar kii kahani bhi kaaphi maarmik he
 In the past 30 years of struggle, by creating an organization, Jabbar has been successful in giving some part of the rights to the victims, but there is still much to be found
 unhen is baat kaa malaal he ki unki is sangharsh yatra ke dauraan 20 hajaar se zyada saathi unase bichhud gaye hai
 The struggle continues till the night of the accident, the poisonous gas was received from the Union Carbide plant on the night of December 2, 1984 in Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh, and in one night it put more than three thousand people to sleep
 vahiin hajaaron log beete 31 varsho main jahrili gas se mili rogon ke chalate maare ja chuke hai or abhi bhi hajaaron log maut kii dahalij par khadey hokar apni baari kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Abdul Jabbar started working among the victims from the night of the accident
 us vakt unki umr 28 varsh thi, ab 58 varsh ke hai
 a year after the accident, she formed the Bhopal Gas Victims Women's Industry Organization and carried forward the struggle
 apane sangharsh kii kahani kaa byoraa dete hue abdul jabbaar ne bataaya ki peediton ke haq kii ladaai main pehali safalataa 1988 main mili jab supreme court ne guzaara bhatta dene kaa nirnay sunaaya
 Then in February 1989, the Bhopal agreement was signed between the Government of India and Union Carbide
 iske mutabik ghayalon ko 25-25 hajaar or mritkon ko ek-ek lakh mila
 After this, the injured got 25-25 thousand on Prorata and the families of the dead got one lakh extra
 paanch lakh se zyada log hue shikabdul jabbaar bataate hai ki mritkon kii sankhya ko lekar shuru se vivaad rahaa he, magar varsh 2001 main ek chaunkaane vaala aankada saamne aayaa jisamen pataa chalaa ki 15 hajaar 276 logon kii maut hui he or paanch lakh 76 hajaar se zyada log gas ke dushprabhavon kaa shikaar he
 On the other hand, due to the fight of his organization, in 2010, the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate of Bhopal sentenced the Union Carbide officers for two years, but it is regrettable that it has not been implemented yet
 unhone aage bataaya ki varsh 2001 main aae maut or prabhaviton ke aankadon ke aadhaar par union carbide se paanch guna or adhik muaavja die jane ke liye unke sanghathan ne sarvocch nyaayalay main yachika daayar kii, isi bich tatkaaleen sarkaar ne sankhya sudhaar ke liye kerrative pitishan daayar kar di
 Both petitions are pending
 jabbaar bataate hai ki ek taraf unki nyaayalayan ladaai jari he to duusari ore unka sanghathan sadak par utarataa rahata he
 Shah Jahanni Park is a witness to this where gas victims have been raising their voice every Tuesday and Saturday since 1986, now people gather only on Saturdays, because twice a week, it costs more money in rent
 
 traasadee ke peediton ke liye shuru kii muhimgas peediton kii ladaaiike liye jahaan sanghathan banaaya tha vahiin prabhaviton ko aarthik taur par sakasham banane ke liye swabhimaan centre chalaaya ja rahaa he
 In this center, sewing, embroidery, brocade work and computer training are imparted
 yah centre sampradayik sadbhaav kii misaal he, yahaan hindu-muslim mahilaayein na sirf ek saath prashikshan leti hai, balki saath khaane main bhi parhez nahin karti
 More than eight thousand women have been trained so far from this center
 jabbaar bataate hai ki beete 30 varsh ke is sangharsh ke dauraan unka saath dene vaale 20 hajaar se zyada logon ko unhone bichhudate dekha he
 These are people who were not only partners in their struggle but also had family relationships with them
 kai dfa to unhen kisi kii maut kii khabar ai to laga ki agar use behatar ilaaj mil jaataa to vah batch jaataa, magar aisa ho na sakaa
 The battle for the rights has not diminished, in the middle of the capital, the office of the Bhopal Gas Victim Women's Industry Organization, located close to the Central Library, the weather is going on every time people come, whenever someone tells their problem, then someone's problem It shows the condition of settlement
 haadase ko hue bhale 31 varsh guzar gaye hon, magar prabhaviton main apane haq kii ladaai kaa jajba kam nahin hua he

 Bajaj has been generous to such questions
 unke pardada jamanalaal bajaj ne 1926 main bajaj auto kii sthapana kii thi
 They immediately attack whatever Bajaj tries to cut the path of their beloved Bajaj Auto
 agar kisi ne unke nae utpaada aarai60 main koi khami nikaali to uski khayr nahin
 The RE60 is India's first quadricycle
 yah europe kii un quadricycles se kaaphi alag he jo mahange, kam bikne vaale, asaadhaaran chizon se bane khaas kism kii gadibhan hoti hai
 The RE-60 is a small car that feels like a well-crafted autorickshaw
 texiyon ke rup main chalane vaali choti kaaron ke nirmaataa aarai60 se dare hue hai, kyonki isaki keemat kaaphi kam hogi, tipahiyaa ke 1
 25 lakhs
 or maaruti sujuki ke olto kii 2
 5 lakhs
 ke bich main kahin
 It will also be more economical in terms of fuel, with a mileage of 35 km in a liter
 tipahiyaa auto ke nirmaataa bhi dare hue hai kyonki aarai60 tipahiyaa vaahan se behatar dikhti he jisamen daravaaje, chat, behatar takanic (water kuld, twin spark plag, paanch gear) he or chaar pahiyon kii vajah se zyada sthirataa he
 This leaves just 60 grams of carbon dioxide per km, which is half that of a small car
 har saal gharelu bazaar main kareeb 4,50,000 tipahiyaa bikate hai
 70,000 three-wheelers run on Delhi's roads alone
 bajaj kehete hai ki mukhyamantri shila dikshit akasar unase yah shikaayat karti thim ki badi sankhya main rajdhani main aane vaale videshi paryatak in auto ke bare main kya chhavi lekar jate honge
 She wanted a slightly more respectable vehicle
 yadi unki tarah hi duusare rajyon ne bhi isko tarjeeh di to bajaj ke aurangabad factory kii essembly line kaaphi vyast ho jaaegi
 Karl Slim, managing director of fourth Wheatata Motors at Auto, questioned Twitter this year on the rationale of bringing a quadricycle: "why the hell?" The government and industry are stepping up efforts to save traffic and save the environment, now we are considering quadricycles! Why are we lagging behind? " To this, Bajaj told a business newspaper that bringing RE-60 meant providing four-wheeler protection to three-wheeler users
 ''yah tark ki sabhi tipahiyaa vaahan maalikon ko isaki jagah car kharid leni chahie, bilkul aisa hi he ki logon se yah kaha jaae ki jo roti nahin kharid sakate ve kek khaakar pet bharen
 Even before such an attitude, we have seen unfortunate results
 ”karl slim asal main dopahiyaa or tipahiyaa vaahanon main bajaj kii kampititor tivies motor company ke mukhiya venu shrinivasana kii bhaavana ko hi doharaa rahe the
 Venu is also a friend of Rajiv's father Rahul Bajaj
 shrinivasana ne yah chintaa jataai thi ki quadricycle se suraksha or polution standard main giravat aegi
 Bajaj's counter attack was that when big cars are considered the safest, then all other vehicles - bicycles, motorcycles, scooters, mopeds, tricycles, small cars, medium size cars - should be banned
 yah thodi sakht pratikriya he, lekin rajeev bajaj ke liye bich kaa koi rasta nahin he
 R
, a 79-year-old honorable chairman of Maruti and another friend of Rajiv's father
 si
 Bhargava got the idea when he said that if the quadricycle was tested with a car on the same road, it would release four times more carbon dioxide
 bajaj ne is par kaha, ''yadi main mistar bhargav kii maaruti car ko luun or ise europe ke kisi car trek par chalaaun, jahaan sadaken badi or speed zyada hoti hai, to dekhte hai, usase kitna polution hota he
 This year the controversy became even clearer in a conference call organized by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), an organization of the auto industry
 kuch companiyon ne jor-shor se yah maang kii ki bajaj ko philhal aarai60 kii lonching se roka jaae
 Ravi Chopra of the three-wheeler maker Piaggio wanted Bajaj to be allowed to launch it after three years so that everyone gets a chance to compete
 quadricycle kii paribhaasha main ek kasuti yah he ki iskaa vajan 500 kilo se zyada nahin hona chahie
 Slim wants this scope to be increased to 700 kg
 sandarbh ke liye bataa den ki aarai60 kaa vajan 397 kilo he or tata naino kaa 650 kilo
 But Bajaj's quadricycle is breaking rules and law-related hurdles
 22 may ko sarkaar ne shahar kii simaaon ke bheetar quadricycle ko public transport ke rup main istemaal karne kii ijaajat de di
 Subsequently, on 8 August, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways issued a draft notification amending the Central Motor Vehicles Act to include quadricycles in the category of vehicles
 iske anusaar quadricycle ko vishesh license or registration kii jarurat hogi or uski body par pramukhataa se 'kyuu’ likhnaa hoga
 Business development head of Bajaj Auto
 sivakumar kehete hai, ''ham manjuuri kaa intjaar kar rahe hai or (aarai60 kii bikri) tatkaal yaa baad main shuru kar sakate hai, yah is baat par nirbhar karata he ki ant main kis tarah kaa byora manjuur kiya jaataa he
 "if all goes well, Bajaj's new vehicle could be seen running on the roads next year
 haalanki is mudde ne auto nirmaataaon ko baant diya
 After long deliberations, the then Director General of SIAM and currently the head of the National Skill Development Council, Dilip Chinoy sent two separate proposals to the Ministry of Transport
 pehla quadricycle ke paksh main tha to doosraa iske khilaaf
 The ministry sat silently on both these proposals
 kai saal baad jab rajeev bajaj ne aarai60 kaa vikaas kiya or ise bazaar main utaarne ke liye raste kii talash kar rahe the tab siam ke khule ravaie se unhen madad mili
 The fact is that his quadricycle is meant to be an improvement on a three-wheeler auto and not to bring something like a car

 But it seemed that he would not be able to live long

 This time again Wallace intervened and did it in a stern tone
 unhone rajeev ke pita ke chehre ke saamne ungali dikhaate hue kaha, ''yadi aapane is ladke ko emb karne ke liye bheja to jab tak yah waapas aayega, company bachi nahin rahegi

 Homework was also given in this
 aisi hi ek class main rajeev ne jab menuphaccharing par ek sawaal poocha to unase ek saal chote 22 varsh ke abraham joseph iskaa jawaab dene ke liye khadey ho gaye
 Half an hour later, Joseph kept talking to them
 bhopal ke riginal ejineering college se mechanical ejineering graduate joseph vah sab kuch jaanate the jo rajeev ko pataa tha, varavik main padhai, master degree hasil karne yaa bharat se baahar gaye bagaiyr
 Rajiv said, "I immediately understood that this man has natural talent
" ”joy ke naam se lokapriy joseph us sheersh team kaa hissaa bane jise rajeev ne menuphaccharing main shreshthata hasil karne ke liye taiyaar kiya tha
 For many years, Joey took over the R&D of Bajaj Auto and he "designed everything"

 Producing the scooter, Bandarajiv gave up his intention of imitating others to pursue his company and insisted on marketing
 isse unhen phaayde hue to kuch balidaan bhi karne pade
 Bajaj has kept distance from scooter, moped and light commercial vehicles
 sabase bada balidaan scooter kaa tha jise company ne varsh 2010 kii shuruyaat se bananaa band kar diya he
 This left many people shocked
 bajaj ke dada camel nayan bharat main scooter lekar aae the or pita rahul ne ise dashakon tak paala-posha tha
 His father is still not happy with this decision and for this he calls Rajeev as an unacceptable
 rajeev kehete hai, ''hamaari shuruyaat company ke liye bhi ek nai shuruyaat thi
 Bajaj Auto existed even before
 lekin hamaare aane ke saath hi scootaron kaa ant ho gaya or motorcykilon ke nae daur kii shuruyaat hui

 haalanki, saal ke antim din bhartiya janata party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke ek phone kol ne gujarat ke andruni siyaasi bavaal par viraam laga diya

 aisa hi ek badlaavkaari daur 1970 ke dashak main kwatarj ghadiiyon kaa aagaman tha
 With that, the kiln of the mechanical watch industry started to sit
 lekin shaano-shaukat vaali ghadiiyon kaa bazaar bana rahaa or smart ghadiiyon tathaa smart phone ke daur main bhi vah kaayam he
 Smart Watches and traditional watches, both in the same product category, have similar designs and wristwatches, but their customers are completely different like brass and gold
 ghadiiyon main badlaav ke safar main kai bade mile ke pattharon ko yaad kiya ja saktaa he
 The oldest tradition of clock-making or clock-making begins with key-clock running
 jeb ghadibhan, mej ghadibhan, haath main lekar chalane yaa taangane vaali ghadibhan or sajane vaali kalai ghadibhan, sabhi chaabi se hi chalati thim
 However, it was an intricate process that allowed the clocks to complete a perfect cycle
 isse paidaa hui soch or mashin ko adhik chust banane kii prakriya main aadmi lagbhag parmaanu jaisaa sookshm tatv bhi banane ke kaabil ho gaya he
 Very small wrist watches were challenging to make, yet they were made
 uske baad kwatarj or automatic ghadiiyon ke avishkaar ne samay maapne ke masini vyapaar ko peeche dhakel diya
 Quartz runs from batteries, so watches became cheaper and available to everyone, while automatic watches relied on kinetic energy from hand movements
 maujuuda daur main digital kranti apane charam par he, kalai ghadi ab bahut kuch bataane lagi he, yah jaan lijie ki aapane kitni calories kharch kii, yaa yah phone kol kaa jawaab dene ke kaam bhi aa sakati he
 That is, there can be many useful things adorned on the wrist
 sabake baavjood aap ghadi-sangraahakon or jaankaron se puuchhen to yahi bataaenge ki sabase pasandida to chaabi bharne vaali kalai ghadi hi he
 It was only after several studies that Ashtaguru launched a different 'exceptional timepieces' auction in 2008
 aankade bataate hai ki nilaamee main ab tak sabase mahangi biki kalai ghadi chaabi se chalane vaali rolex datona thi jo pehle hollywood star paul newman kii hua karti thi
 The 1968 wristwatch was gifted to Hollywood actor by his wife Joanne Woodward
 ise 2017 main neuyork main nilaamee ke liye rakhaa gaya or yah 1
 Sold for $ 78 million (which included the auction house's share / buyer's premium, etc
)
 nijee taur par main is prachlit dharna se rajamand hum ki haath se sanchalit chizon kaa mahatv swachaalit gatividhiyon se adhik he kyonki usamen aadmi ke kaushal kii pariksha hoti he
 Many functions of the key clock can create thrills and converge the thoughts
 Then, in today's part-time life, filling the key in the clock can be like meditating
 doosraa mahatvapurn pahalu yah he ki inkaa utpaadan thok bhav main nahin hota isliye ye mushkil se milti hai or maang bhi khaas hoti he
 Key-looking wrist watches also look more attractive because they are thin and smaller, while automatic watches are heavier on the wrist
 apane khaas pahaluon ke alaava chaabi bharne vaali ghadiiyon main laga maanav-shram use baakiyon kii tulana main adhik maanviya bana detaa he
 Finally, hand watches are also of importance in this case with automatic watches that symbolize the leap in human civilization when we were able to unite in times of difficulty and began to chart the way forward
 kaal yaa samay kaa pahalu sabase praasangik he, yah isse bhi sabit hota he ki amejan ke jeff bejos ne '10,000 saalaa ghadi' banane kaa abhikram shuru kiya he
 This watch will work for ten millennia and the purpose is to tell how long the heritage of our species is
 kul milakar asli baat yah he ki hamaari jo hakeekat he, uskaa bayaan samay hi karegaa
 In this sense, a hand operated watch tells our journey in more detail

 par yah hakeekat he or yah ajooba kar dikhaaya he muraina ke ek saadhaaran se parivaar ke yuvak ne, jiskaa naam he manoj sharma
 Manoj Sharma is the Additional Commissioner of Police in Mumbai today
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne buudhvaar ko inhen manoj sharma par likhi kitaab kaa vimochan kiya
 The name of the book written in English is "12th fail" This book is written by Anurag Pathak
 anuraag pathak 15 varshon tak manoj sharma ke room partner rahe hai
 The book describes both the goodness and weakness of Sharma's personality, especially the insistence on achieving higher degrees and reaching the destination despite being laggards in studies
 manoj sharma main vifaltaaon ko maat dekar sangharsh karte hue lagaataar aage badhane kii jid hi thi jo 12 veen fail hone ke baad bhi ipies ban gaye
 According to author Anurag Pathak, Manoj Sharma is the hero of his book and the purpose of writing the book on him is to fill courage in students who are afraid of studies and exams, to show new hope
 khaas baat ki apni vifaltaa ko kis tarahan safalataa main badla ja saktaa he ye sikh manoj sharma ke jivan se milti he
 Failing in 12th became a boon for Manoj Sharma
 hua yah ki us varsh muraina main aisa esadm aayaa tha jisane nakal par puri tarah roak laga di thi varna manoj sharma bhi duusare vidhyaarthiyon kii tarah paas to ho hi jate
 In such a situation, usually any student curses the DM but Manoj Sharma is determined to be like him and then the path of struggle he chose to move towards the stage of success
 lekin yah sab itnaa aasaan bhi nahin tha
 There were thorns in the path
 paise kii kami sabase badi baadha thi
 To overcome the financial crisis, Sharma had to take care of the dogs of big people for this
 librari main kaam karnaa padaa
 But Jid never let him die
 12 veen paas kii, degree lee or phir maas communication main piechdi bhi kar lee
 Failed three times in civil service examination
 kehete hai pyaar aadmi ko kamjor bana detaa he lekin manoj sharma kaa pyaar, shraddha unki takat ban gai or phir jid ke aage jeet to milani hi thi

 unhone twit main ek daawa ye bhi kiya, "unke paas canada kaa passport he, lekin ve pichley saat saal se canada nahin gaye hai
 "now a Twitter user has objected to Akshay's claims

 This tweet is five years old
 yani is twit kii maane to akshay toronto (canada) main kam se kam paanch saal saal pehle to gaye hi the
 That is, the claim of not going to Canada for seven years is proving to be a one-time wrong

 PM modi ne aadhaar mudde par kaha ki jab ham chunaav jeet kar aae to congress kii taraf se kaha jaataa tha ki modi aadhaar ko khatm kar degaa

 The long wait for the people of Delhi and the National Capital Region troubled by the scorching heat is going to end soon
 mausam vibhaag kii maane to dilli or aasapaas ke ilaakon main agle 72 ghanton main monsoon dastak de saktaa he or joardaar barish ho sakati he
 If there is a fair amount of rain in Delhi, is the national capital ready to deal with the many problems caused by the rain
 aarthik rajdhani mumbai main har saal musaladhar barish hoti he or barish shuru hone ke kuch der main hi kai ilaakon main jalajmav kii sthiti paidaa ho jaati he
 The roads get jammed
 qamar tak lage pani main saikadon gaadiyaan funs jaati hai
 Household items start flowing in water
 aam janajivan ast-vyast ho jaataa he
 Every year a large number of people get flooded and waste hundreds of crores of rupees, but till date Mumbai has not been able to find any concrete solution to deal with the rain water
 is baar mumbai main joardaar barish hui he jisane pichley kai saalon kaa record tod diya he
 Like the Mumbai, the situation of the jam is everywhere in the rain and people of delhi-ncr who are eagerly waiting for the rain get upset in a few hours of rain and start tripping
 barish ke kaaran dilli main bhi jagah-jagah jam lag jaataa he or jaljbharav kii sthiti ban jaati he
 Now in Delhi, the monsoon is going to knock in this season soon
 ek najar daalate hai ki dilli barish or baadh ko lekar kitni taiyaar he
 In Mumbai, there are 201 natural drainage systems to deal with the rains of normal life affected by rain in Delhi, while 1,296 prepared drainage has been prepared in the entire Delhi according to the report of Irrigation and Flood Control Department, GNCTD (2017)
 System
 prakritik drenez 350 kilometre or kritrim drenez system 1,694
 Covers an area of 1 kilometer
 jiensitidi ne dilli ko 6 drenez jone main baant rakhaa he
 There is no single responsibility, however, delhi-ncr does not have a single system to monitor the drainage system
 kai nagar nikaayon, irigation and flud control department or dilli jal board samet kai vibhaagon ke paas alag-alag jagahon kii drenez system dekhne kii jimmedaari he
 This is the reason that when there is a situation of water logging due to heavy rains during the monsoon, everyone starts accusing each other
 1901 se lekar 2016 ke bich vaarshik aadhaar par hone vaali barish or barish ke dinon ke aadhaar par dekha jaae to in 115 saalon main 210 millimetre barish kaa ijapha haa he, lekin baari barish kii tulana main sookhe kii sthiti zyada bhayaavah hui he
 In 1901, Delhi received about 511 mm of rain, which increased to 721 mm in 2016
 2001 main sabase zyada barishmausam vibhaag kii 2016 kii report ke anusaar, dilli main sabase zyada barish 2001 main darj kii gai thi jab 1,161
 It rained 3 mm
 pichley 116 saalon main mahaj 3 baar hi barish ek hajaar millimetre se zyada barish hui thi
 255 lowest in 1916
 6 millimetre barish darj kii gai thi
 Even though the monsoon is coming late this time in Delhi, but it has been raining for many days
 1901 main jahaan mahaj 28 din barish hui thi vahiin 2016 main 37 din barish hui or is tarah se barish ke dinon main 9 din kaa ijapha hua
 In the last 115 years, only 2 times (2003 and 2010), more than 50 days had received 52 and 50 days of rain respectively
 haalanki 2003 main 52 din barish hone ke baad agle saal 2004 main 35 se bhi kam din hi barish hui
 Similarly, in 2010, 50 days of rain fell the following year and was reduced to 36 days
 1918 main sabase kam 21 din hi barish darj kii gai
 Apart from increasing the speed of rain per hour, in addition to heavy rain and increase in rainy days in Delhi, the speed of rain per hour has also increased
 1986 main jahaan 22
 It used to rain at 9 mm per hour, then it increased to 22 in 2016
 9 millimetre prati ghanta ho gaya
 According to the 2016 report of the Meteorological Department, there has been a decline in monsoon rainfall

 It is believed that these 'missing' drains fell to the increasing encroachment and were made to be homes and roads
 rajdhani main baadh or baari barish se north-east, east, central or south-east dilli sabase zyada prabhavit kshetra hai, saath hi in kshetron main badi aabaadi bhi rahati he
 But due to poor drainage system, not only does water get everywhere, but also creates a situation of jam
 2017 kii ek report ke anusaar, lajpat nagar se ashram jane main saamaanya taur par 30 minute kaa samay lagata he, lekin barish hone kii sthiti main 90 minute lagate hai
 It takes an average of 37 minutes to go from one place to another in Delhi, but on rainy days it takes one and a half hours
 monsoon main is saal barish abhi hui nahin he, lekin ab tak kaa itihaas kahata he ki ghantebhar kii barish se hi rajdhani pareshaan ho jaati he
 Like every year, this time also promises were made that water logging will not be allowed to happen, but it will have to be seen whether the rain makes people cry this time

 dilli bijepi main tikat bantwaare ke saath hi baghawat ke sur sunai dene lage hai
 Annoyed at not getting tickets to state president Satish Upadhyay, his supporters demonstrated at the party office
 is bich, kiran bedi ne harshavardhan se unke ghar jaakar mulaakaat kii
 It is believed that Bedi was trying to get away from Harsh Vardhan for Sunday's incident when she left her house without meeting him
 party ne bedi ko krishna nagar se tikat diya he, jahaan se harshavardhan lagaataar paanch baar chunaav jite hai
 On Tuesday evening, both of them tried to give a message by addressing the workers together in Krishna Nagar that everything is fine
 harshavardhan ne kaaryakartaaon se kaha ki vah sirf vidhayak hi nahin, balki dilli kaa mukhyamantri chunane ja rahe hai
 Bedi also praised him and said that if he had become the chief minister, it would have been good for Delhi

 bijepi kaa tikat paane kii aakankshi shikha raay ko bhi tikat nahin milane ke virodh main unke samarthakon ne bhi dilli bijepi karyaalay ke saamne dharna diya
 This trend of protest was also seen in many other areas
 vijender gupta ko rohinee se tikat milane se naaraaz bijepi kaaryakartaaon ne pradarshan kiya, to vahiin kai duusari jagahon par istife bhi hue
 The biggest protest is why outsiders were given tickets
 bijepi ne ranneeti ke tahat apane ummidavaar sabase aakhir main ghoshit kiye the, kyonki vah aise pradarshan rokna chaahati thi
 But it does not seem to have fully succeeded in it

 Bajpai spoke to key correspondent Ashish Mishra about his plan
 baatcheet ke ansh
 What did BJP get from the first meeting of the State Working Committee after the defeat in the last assembly election? The Working Committee got introspective
 kamiyaan pataa chalin
 Now the party's full emphasis will be on building the organization up to the booth level
 booth par kaaryakarta or janata kaa behatar taratamya hi agle chunaav main achche pradarshan kii raah kholegaa
 BJP is losing its support base in every election in the state
 party isaki kya vajah maanati he?do mukhya kshetra hai jahaan par party behad kamjor he
 First, the party has lost its grip in the rural areas and second, due to the casteist politics of the other parties, the voters of the backward classes have lost the party
 inhen dobaaraa party se jodgaye kii ranneeti par kaam ho rahaa he
 How will the workers win the elections because of the sluggish workers after the temple movement? The enthusiasm of the workers is due to the "X Factor"
 ram mandir andolan ke baad party kaa teji se janaadhar badha
 New officers were formed in the organization from top to bottom
 samay ke saath ye padaadhikari bhi hate or dusron ne inaki jagah lee
 Due to this, a significant number of former (X) officials are in BJP who are feeling neglected in the party
 inhen dobaaraa sakriy karnaa padegaa
 The party's base among Muslims is very weak
 kya inke vot liye bagaiyr party agle chunaav main behatar pradarshan kar sakati he?bijepi ko musalamaanon kaa vot nahin chahie aisa main nahin kahata
 But no such thing will be done to get the votes of the Muslims that the party should not be anywhere
 loksabhaa ke pratyaashee chunane main itani der kyon ho rahi he?kshetreey dalon ne apane ummidavaar utaare hai, lekin ab inhen badla ja rahaa he
 The BJP will announce the candidate once by whistling, which will have little chance of change
 loksabhaa chunaav main party ne uttar pradesh se kitni siten jeetne kaa lakshya rakhaa he?ham to adhik-se-adhik siten jeetne kaa prayaas karenge
 Based on the feedback received from the activists, BJP is in a position to win 32 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 agar ‘modi fact’ aa gaya to yah aankada 40 paar kar jayega
 Will the Chief Minister of Gujarat contest from the Lok Sabha seat of Uttar Pradesh? Narendra Modi is not currently thinking of contesting elections from Uttar Pradesh at any stage in the party
 kuch kaaryakarta vyaktigat taur par aisi maang kar rahe hai
 The BJP talks of Hindutva, but has become silent on the Ram temple issue
 kya ab yah mudda nahin rahaa?ram mandir mudda nahin, yah bijepi kii aasthaa kaa pratik he
 In the Lok Sabha elections, we will appeal to the public to give BJP a majority at the Center to construct the Ram temple

 The Talwar couple then went to the Allahabad High Court, which dismissed their plea seeking cancellation of the summons of the lower court and the hearing initiated against them

 Before performing Bhajan Kirtan, always install the picture of Lord Mangal Murthy only after that start Bhajan Kirtan
 - jis devi devtaa kaa bhajan kiya ja rahaa he uske chitra ke saamne gaay ke ghi kaa deepak or dhoop avashya jalaaen jal kaa paatr bhi rakhen

 - If anyone remains ill in the house, chant Mahamrityunjaya Mantra and offer raw milk on Shivling

 desh main bitcoin ko lekar charchaa tej hoti gai he, lekin ab yah galat kaarnon se surkhiyon main he
 On December 13, the Income Tax Department surveyed nine major Bitcoin exchanges across the country including Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Kochi and Gurugram on suspicion of tax evasion
 reporton ke anusaar, iskar vibhaag motaa paisa nivesh karne vaale aise 4 se 5 lakh vyaktiyon ko notice jari karne ja rahaa he jo is aniyantrit abhaasi (virtual) karency ke exenjon ke jariye vyapaar karte rahe hai
 Despite action against this digital currency, bitcoin trade has been growing rapidly in India
 udyog ke sutron kaa anumaan he ki kareeb 80 lakh bhartiya kisi central bank yaa kisi niyantrak ke bina is digital karency main vyapaar kar rahe hai
 The value of bitcoin has increased 2,000 percent since January this year and on December 16, the value of one bitcoin was $ 19,500 (about 12
 5 lakh ru
 ) And thus became the most expensive currency in the virtual world
 reporton se pataa chalata he ki vittiya kshetra ko niyantrit karne vaali sansthaaen, jinamein bhartiya rigerv bank or bhartiya pratibhuti vinimay board (sebi) shaamil hai, bhole-bhaale niveshkon kii suraksha or niyamon ke abhaav kaa phayda uthaakar dhokhadhadi karne waalon ke khilaaf karrwai karne ke liye jaldi hi ek vyavastha taiyaar karenge
 Sources say that although Bitcoin is not considered legal but has also not been declared illegal and there is no way to take action against those who trade through it
 iske ulat kuch log bitcoin ko bhavishya kii karency maanate hai, kyonki yah digital, jodgaye vaala or niyantrakon se munnt he
 "income tax survey is good for bitcoin exchanges," says Shubhransh Rai, COO and co-founder of Delhi-based bitcoin exchange ethxpay
 sarkaar ko is kaarobaar ko manyata dena shuru kar dena chahie
 "investors can open an account on bitcoin exchanges by giving their Aadhar card and PAN card information and use their bank accounts to buy bitcoins or open private wallets
 ek nijee kunjee kaa istemaal karke is wolet se duusare digital violeton main lenden kiya jaataa he
 "if it is illegal, the government has all the rights to ban this business," says Rai
 "visheshgyon ke mutabik, ho saktaa he, sarkaar bhavishya main bitcoin par tex lagane kii baat soch rahi ho
 It is getting recognition from large exchanges around the world, including Nasdaq
 march 2017 main vitt mantralay ne bharat or vishwa main abhaasi karency kii sthiti kaa jayja lene or unase nipatane ke upayon par suzav lene ke liye ek bahu-vishyak samiti kaa gathan kiya tha
 The committee has submitted its report and it is believed that the ministry is investigating it
 iske kaarobaar main khataron or asthirataa (iskaa mulya kuch hi ghanton main aasmaan par chadh saktaa he to ek jatke main ghota bhi laga saktaa he) ko dekhte hue bahut sambhaavna he ki bitcoin jaldi hi sarkaar kii jaanch ke ghere main aa jaae
 This precaution is also necessary because no one would want to play with danger amidst the mild hope of improvement in the economic condition of the country

 The world's largest sports court 'court of Arbitration for Sport' (CAS) on Tuesday relaxed the ban imposed on Russia's legendary female tennis player Maria Sharapova for doping
 siees ne pratibandh ke khilaaf sharapova kii yachika par sunwaayee karte hue antarrashtriya tennis mahasang (itief) ke swatantra nyaayaadhikaran dwaara lagaae gaye do varsh ke pratibandh ko ghataakar 15 maheene kar diya
 According to news agency Taas, Russia Tennis Federation (RTF) president Shamil Tarapishchev said Sharapova would return to the tennis court by April 26 next year
 siees kii website par faisle kii copy mangalvaar ko prasaarit kar di gai he
 He said, 'it is good to reduce the ban
 chunki sharapova saaf suthri khilaadi hai isliye unhone (siees) hamaari apil ko mana
 Sharapova, who did not play in Rio, said the RTF president, "it is entirely up to her whether she can make a comeback with the old standard of her game
" ’ unhone kaha, ‘ham haalanki chaahate hai ki vah rashtriya team ke liye khelen or agle olympic main padak jeet kar aaen
 On 8 June, the ITF imposed a two-year ban on Sharapova for being found guilty of doping
 roosi khilaadi ne is pratibandh ke khilaaf nau june ko siees main apil daayar kii thi
 Due to this ban, former World No
 1 players could not participate in Rio Olympics-2016
 10 saalon se pratibandhit dawa le rahi thim sharapowagauratlab he ki paanch baar grand slam khitaab jeet chukin sharapova isi varsh australian open ke dauraan meldonium ke seven kii doshi pai gai thim, jiske baad itief ne un par pratibandh lagaaya tha
 However, the CAS has made it clear in its decision that Sharapova will have a 15-month ban, which will be considered from January 26, 2016

 Sharapova hoped that the ITF would find a solution to their ban
 siees kaa faisla aane ke baad sharapova ne apane fasebuk par likhaa, ‘maine shuruyaat se hi yah jimmedaari lee thi ki maine pichley 10 varshon se us padaarth kaa seven kiya he jise ab pratibandhit kar diya gaya he
 'take a lesson from other federations,' ITF Sharapova wrote, 'but i also learned how well other federations tell their players about the change in rules, especially in Eastern Europe where miladronate is used by millions of people is
 ’ sharapova ne likhaa, ‘ab yah prakriya khatm ho chuki he
 i hope the ITF and other tennis anti-doping institutions will learn from other federations so that no other tennis player has to go through all these things that i went through
 ’gauratlab he ki meldonium ko wada ne ek janvari 2016 ko apane pratibandhit padaarthon kii suchi main shaamil kiya tha
 Kannauj of Uttar Pradesh, known as the perfume city, is famous worldwide for the fragrance of perfume
 kaha jaataa he ki kannauj kii hawaaen apane saath khushboo liye chalati hai
 Perfume is widely traded in this city
 kannauj main itr kaarobaar kii kareeb 200 se adhik ikaiyaan maujuud hai
 Most of these units make large-scale perfumes
 itr banane ke liye kai shaharon se yahaan phool or lakadiyaan mangai jaati hai
 It is also made from clay
 Perfume is said that when the raindrops fall on the soil of Kannauj, the soil here also gives a special fragrance
 khaas baat yah he ki yahaan mitti se bhi itr banaaya jaataa he
 For this, clay is cooked in copper utensils
 iske baad mitti se nikalne vaali khushboo ko base oil ke saath milaayaa jaataa he
 In this way the process of making perfumes out of the soil goes on
 kyon khaas he kannauj kaa itr-khaas baat yah he ki duniya kaa sabase mahangaa itr kannauj main banataa he
 The perfume here also smells to avoid restlessness and stress
 kannauj kaa itr puri tarah se prakriti ke gunon se bharpoor hota he
 Alcohol is not used in this
 kannauj main duniya ke sabase saste itr se lekar sabase mahange itr banaae jate hai, jinamein sabase mahangaa itr 'adraud' he
 This perfume is prepared from the special wood of Assam
 is ek gram itr kii keemat lagbhag 5000 rupee he
 According to the report, Kannauj's perfume is supplied in many countries including UK, US, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Iraq, Iran
 itr kaa istemaal cosmetic ke saath gutkha or paan masala banane main bhi kiya jaataa he
 The Center may soon appoint a group of negotiators led by a Congress leader to carry forward the proposed peace talks in Jammu and Kashmir
 aisa samajha jaataa he ki grih mantri pi chidambaram ne is mudde par pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke saath somvaar dopaher aamane-saamne baatcheet main charchaa kii
 It is believed that some senior Congress leaders were discussed in this
 aadhikarik sutron ne bataaya ki centre kathith taur par jammu kashmir ke rajyapal ke pad par pehali baar kisi rajnatik vyakti ko niyukt karne ke vikalp par bhi vichaar kar rahaa he
 Sources said that no political person has ever been appointed Governor in Jammu and Kashmir and the appointment of a leader is expected to give further impetus to the initiative
 aisa samajha ja rahaa he ki kendriya mantri or congress netaa prithviraj chavaan ke naam par vaartakaron ke samooh ke pramukh ke taur par vichaar kiya gaya he
 These names are expected to be announced as soon as possible
 aisi atakalein hai ki madhya pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh ke naam par bhi charchaa hui lekin is baat kii pushti nahin hui he
 The appointment of the interlocutors is part of the Centre's eight-point peace initiative announced last fortnight
 taarikh 16 june, 2009, sthaan yeketerinburg (rus)
 
 
 In this meeting between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistani President Zardari, Zardari had no idea what was going to be fired on him initially
 donon netaaon ne kamare main pravesh kiya, aamane-saamne baithe, tivi or still camaron ke shor ke bich zaradaari ne tashareef rakhi hi ki manmohan bol pade, 'mujhe aapse milane kii behad khushi he, magar main aapako bataanaa chahta hum ki meraa mandet aapako yah bataanaa he ki pakistan kii zamin kaa istemaal seemaa paar aatankwaad ke liye nahin hona chahie
 ' Then what was left? Zardari Shun
 
 
 pakistani pratinidhimandal sann
 
 
 The media itself was shocked, because Manmohan, who is generally soft and silent, would have made such a public comment for the first time
 padhein: hafiz said kii paheli or pakistanbharat or pakistan ke sambandhon or zaradaari manmohan kii ravivaar ko honi vaali mulaaqaat ko is sandarbh main dekhne kii zarurat he
 This was not the last time, however, that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's public outcry of this hapless stance
 yaad hoga aapako, amariki raashtrapati obama ke saath saajha pressvarta main bhi unhone kaha tha, 'ham logon kii naukariyaan churaane ke peshey main nahin hai
 
 
 'everyone knows that Obama's stance on the issue of outsourcing jobs in India is no less than the so-called Taliban
 padhein: ye maranaa bhi koi maranaa he lallu
 
 
 But this time we are meeting again
 16 june, saal 2009 or 8 april, 2012 main kaaphi vaqt guzar chukaa he, lihaaza donon hi pakshon main sambandhon ko sudharne kii ek eemaandaar pahal dikhaai de rahi he, niyat dikhaai de rahi he
 However, the reason behind this cleanliness also has to be understood
 aakhir kyon pakistan bharat ke saath vyapaar sambandh saamaanya karnaa chahta he? aakhir kyon bhartiya punjab se bijli kii maang kii ja rahi he? kyon bharat ko most faverd raashtra kaa darja die jane kii adhuri hi sahi, koshish kii ja rahi he? bharat kii niyat ko samajhnaa mushkil nahin he
 In fact, in the history of Prime Ministers of India, Manmohan Singh wants to achieve a special place in indo-pak relations
 mazaaq to yah bhi kiya jaataa he ki aksar ke manmohan dil hi dil main bharat-paak sambandhon ko behatar karne ke liye nobel shaanti puraskaar jeetna chaahate hai
 
 
 And even if the truth is buried in this joke, it will not surprise you
 padhein: ‘raktbeej’ jaisaa tha batullahsch to yah he ki 26 / 11 ke hamalon ke baad agar bharat-paak sambandhon main tarakkee hui he, to iske peeche manmohan kii khaas pahal ek badi vajah rahi he
 For this, he has often read criticism in the strategic community and political fraternity, but there is no stop in his move
 kai baar jamini haqiqaton ko nazarandaz karke unhone apane is jazbe ko paravaan chadhaaya he or aalochana kii shuruyaat bhi yaheen se hui he
 But the question is: why has Pakistan's attitude changed in the last few days? After all, why is he now talking about improving trade and cultural relations by keeping Kashmir away? Why is the issue of Kashmir not dominating the relationship between the two countries for the first time? One unfortunate consequence of this is that the attitude of India in the Mumbai attacks also hardens
 aapane gaur kiya hoga ki khud grih mantri chidambaram ne kaha tha ke hafiz said ke mudde ko zaradaari ke yatra main haaavee nahin hone diya jayega
 But we will return the same question
 sawaal yah ke pakistan ke rukh main narmi kyon?jawaab bilkul spasht he
 First and foremost thing
 
 
 pichley ek saal main paak-amareeki sambandh behad tezi se rasaatal main jate dikhe hai
 The decline in the diplomatic relations between the US and Pakistan has made it clear that now America will not bailout Pakistan unconditionally
 yani, afghanistan se lagi seemaa uske liye sirdard thi hi, pakistan nahin chahta ki bharat ke saath satee seemaa main bhi tanaav ho
 His financial condition is also very tight
 vah jaanata he ki bharat ke saath saamaanya sambandh uske liye anya kai mulkon ke liye dwaar kholenge, jisaki seemaa uske saath nahin satee hui he
 Consider what Pakistan would benefit from normal relations
 donon punjab ke bich bijli kaa grid or tel pipe-line uski urja kii zaruuraton ko kitna kam kar degaa, iskaa andaja nahin kiya ja saktaa
 There is a lot of enthusiasm in Pakistani Punjab after the opening of trade in Wagah and Attari
 
 
 or agar banking or nivesh ke kshetra main raste khul jaaen, to sone pe suhaaga
 If Wagah is opened, how can Gujarat Sindh and Rajasthan Sindh be left behind? It is being told that Pakistan is putting a lot of emphasis behind making business visas easier
 kya yah bataane kii zarurat he ki bijness kii zyada zarurat kise he, khaskar tab, jab puraane humdam tyoriyaan dikhne lagen, to
 
 
 India will have to practice its point on this occasion
 yah makul mauka he ki pakistan par behad sanjidagi or saavdhaanee se aatankwaad ke mudde par apni chintaaen raakhi jaaen
 Take one hand, then give one hand
 
 
 kootneeti kaa falsafa he
 We know that Hafiz Saeed will not enjoy hospitality in Indian jails so easily due to the instigation of ISI and Army, but this opportunity is right
 khud paak sena or iesai par betahasha dabaav he or ab to prajatantric taur par chunakar ai gilaani sarkaar bhi use aankh dikhaa rahi he
 So the meaning of saying is that Pakistan is changing and it has its compulsion, not its destiny
 hamen isi majaburi kaa phayda uthaanaa hoga
 i believe that the country whose army believes in the official philosophy of bloodshed with thousands of wounds to India, this change cannot come so quickly and easily, but when mutual interest is added, it will not be difficult either
 pakistan main ek puri peedi badal rahi he
 East Pakistan has a large number of people who feel the pain of Partition, but the number of people who feel it wholeheartedly and turn it into hatred is also decreasing
 ant main ek hi baat yaad aati he mujhe
 Recently i met some Pakistani journalists and for the first time i heard them saying that the Bhaijaan terrorist is just a terrorist, the idea of dividing it into bad and good is wrong and meaningless
