 After the news of stone-pelting happening in rural areas of four tribal-dominated districts of Jharkhand, BJP President Amit Shah has directed the state government to take strict action on this issue
 bataa den ki rajya ke khunti, gumla, lohardaga or chibasa ilaakon main kuch adivasee sanghathan naa to skool chalane de rahe hai
 Neither are they allowing government officials to enter the villages
 adivasee gram sabha ne farmaan jari kiya ki patthalgadi kiye gaye gaanvon main naa sirf bahari logon kaa pravesh varjit kiya gaya he
 Rather, children have now come to their schools
 iske chalate in dinon yahaan bacchon kii padhai bhi band he
 At the same time, if the tribals believe of the savior, they are doing all these things under the Constitution
 isamen unhen yah adhikaar diya gaya he ki ve gaanvon main apana kanoon or vidhaan lagu kar sakate hai
 Gram Sabha approved courses will now be taught in schools
 kya he patthalgadi?patthalgadi adivaasiyon kii pracheen parampara he
 In this, unwanted people were denied entry into the villages by placing inscriptions outside the villages
 iskaa istemaal adivasee apni jameen kii pahchaan ke liye bhi karte the
 But after independence, some rights were given to the Gram Sabha under Article 13, 19 (5) (6) in the Constitution
 ab isi ko galat tareeke se paribhaashit kar logon ko sarkari yojanaon or anudaanon kaa bhi bahishkaar karne ke liye baadhya kiya ja rahaa he

 There have been some incidents in the past in which security forces and officers were kept hostage overnight when they entered the village
 vahiin in gaavon main media ko jane se bhi roka ja rahaa he
 But it is not the case that all villages agree with this approach of the gram sabha

 If the arrests of 16 people have been done till now, then under the guise of the gram sabha all these things are being done under a thoughtful strategy

 They are also being prepared to resort to violence for their rights

 Has the relationship between the US and North Korea become so bad that war is the only solution
 kya north korea ke taanashaah or america raashtrapati donald trump ne thaan liya he ki jang hokar rahegi
 Has the date of this war also been decided
 or kya is jang ke saath teesraa vishwa yuddh bhi shuru ho jayega? darasal ye saare sawaal isliye achaanak sir uthaa rahe hai kyonki donald trump ke raashtrapati banane kii bhavishyavaanee karne vaale horsiyo villegus kii agali bhavishyavaanee ye he ki isi maheene kii 13 taarikh ko teesraa vishwa yuddh shuru hone vaala he, jo paanch maheenon tak chalegaa
 On the 13th, it is considered inauspicious that such a date is not auspicious
 ank shaastra main ise number of deth
 In Christianity, Satan's number is considered and in Hinduism it is considered inauspicious
 magar ab isi 13 taarikh ko yaad kar lijie
 If there is a diary, then also note it down
 or ye dua kiijie ki horsiyo villegus kii ye bhavishyavaanee sach na ho
 Because if this happens then it will not be auspicious for humanity at all
 america ke texas main rahane vaale horsiyo villegus ne 2015 main donald trump ke america raashtrapati banane kii bhavishyavaanee karne ke baad ab ek nai bhavishyavaanee kii he
 This new prediction is of World War
 villegus jo khud ko bhagwaan kaa doot bataate hai, unke mutabik is maheene kii 13 taarikh se shuru ho jayega vishwayuddh
 However, given the kind of situation that currently exists between the US and North Korea, many people in the world have already speculated that war and world war may soon break out between the two countries
 13 oktober ko hoga vishwayuddh kaa antamgar villegus kii bhavishyavaanee daraane vaali isliye he kyonki unke mutabik ye vishwayuddh puure 5 maheene chalegaa or iskaa ant 13 oktober ko hoga
 According to Villegas, America, North Korea, South Korea, Japan as well as Syria, Russia and China will join this world war
 ye pehali baar he jab kisi sateek taarikh ke saath kisi ne itani badi bhavishyavaanee kii he
 Therefore, Villegas' claim has sparked worldwide debate
 maamla isliye bhi garm he
 Because America's strategy on North Korea and Syria is no longer hidden from anyone
 or andeshaa jataayaa ja rahaa he ki kabhi bhi badi jang chhid sakati he
 Scaring the whole world, Villegas has also predicted that this great war will be a nuclear war
 or isamen maut or tabaahi behisaab hogi
 In which a large part of the world will end
 uttar korea ke lagaataar pareekshan ke baad haalanki ye kayaas to kaaphi pehle se lagaaya ja rahaa tha

 It is reported that South Korea is secretly training its special commandos so that in the event of war, they can enter North Korea and attack Kim-jong-ki and kill him
 jisaki ijazat ke bina north korea main patta tak nahin hilta
 In front of which the whole country bowed down
 ab use jhukaane ke liye dakshin korea ke commando puri tarah se mustaid ho rahe hai
 The training given to the South Korean Special Commands is considered to be the most difficult in the whole world
 commando ko mila kim ko maarane kaa mishanisiilie na sirf inkaa jism faaulad ho jaataa he balki furti chitah se bhi tej hoti he
 They do not know what is the pain

 Similarly, visual media is also establishing its importance in a new environment, but if public sentiments are ignored, social media can beat them both
 tippaniyan The Chief Minister said that this is a big challenge in the coming time, so the media will have to maintain its credibility

 ) Bhupendra Yadav claims, three-quarters of the seats will be won by Shiv Sena, our old ally- BJP will take action against the leaders of 'rebellious' Rajya Sabha MP and senior BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav has dismissed any news of a rift with Shiv Sena in Maharashtra
 unhone kaha he ki bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan is baar teen chauthai siten jeetegi
 Warning the party rebels in the Maharashtra elections, he said that action will be taken against those who will walk away from the bjp's official line
 unhone kaha ki bijepi or shivasena ke bich jo samjhauta hua he usamen sammaan, garima or aadar sabakuch shaamil he
 Our correspondent Sahil Joshi spoke to Bhupendra Yadav
 kya aapako lagata he ki aap behatar sthiti main hote agar aap maharashtra main akele hi chunaav kaa saamana karte?bhupendra yadav:sabase pehali baat yah he ki maharashtra main bhartiya janata party or shivasena kii gathbandhan majboot he, doosraa hamane or shivasena ne saath milkaar kaam kiya he
 Thirdly, our ideology is very similar and the Yehbajpa and Shiv Sena alliance will form a strong government by winning three fourth seats
 shivasena hamaari puraani sahyogi rahi he
 So it has been easy to combine
 chunaav main maatr das din baaki hai abhi tak joint menifesto nikal nahin paaya he abhi kuch dikkatein hai kya?bhupendra yadav:samaan muddon ko lekar ham log kaam kar rahe hai
 bjp's manifesto is yet to come
 15 taarikh ko hamaara ghoshnaa patr aayega
 Political parties work on their different issues, but the Shiv Sena and BJP are of similar views
 jarurat hogi to usapar bhi nirnay kiya jayega
 But our view, the way of working is on the basis of similar issues
 30 se zyada jagahon par baghawat dikh rahi ,kya donon party main mahatvakanksha bad gai hai?bhupendra yadav:donon party apana-apana ghoshnaa patr jari karegi or donon ghoshnaa patr samaan vichaar par hai
 The second topic is that the small parties with which they contest elections in other states all issue their own manifestos
 jahaan tak isbaar shivasena bajepi ke kaam karne kaa tarika he ham bahut majboot tareeke se kaam kar rahe hai
 Our workers are meeting at the lower level
 agar bijepi ke logon ne shivasena ke kisi seat par vidroh kii sthiti banaai he to unke upar party anushaasanic karrwai karegi
 What is the reason for the rebellion? Bhupendra Yadav: There is no rebellion, the subject of two to four seats, disciplinary action will be taken against such people
 aapane shivasena ko kaise manaaya ?bhupendra yadav:pehali baat to yah he kii kabhi bhi siton ko lekar shivasena pramukh or mukhyamantri ke bich bayaanbaji kabhi nahin kii gai
 Therefore, the agreement reached between the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party is by mutual agreement
 jo samjhauta hua he isamen sammaan, garima or aadar sabakuch shaamil he
 The agreement is very well done
 donon dalon ke vishwaas par hua he or donon dalon ne iskaa swaagat kiya he
 Prominent leaders of both parties have held a press conference together
 jo bhi bate hai iskaa koi matlab nahin he
 Maharashtra has never been a state of Bajpai, how could BJP make this change
 kya ye modi ji kaa karishma he?bhupendra yadav: bhartiya janata party kaa pichley paanch saalon main jo desh bhar main utthan hua he
 Certainly the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a big subject in that
 iske saath hi vigat paanch varshon main amit shah kii kushal ranneeti ke kaaran bhi sanghathan kaa vistaar hua he
 Wherever the state governments have been under the leadership of the Prime Minister, there has been work for good governance
 sushasan kaa arth he ki antim vyakti tak jo saadhan he wo sidhe logon tak pahunche
 Developing infrastructure without any corruption, and achieving social justice subjects with brotherhood at the social level
 in vishyon kii uplabdhiyaan devendra fadanvis ne bhi hasil kii he
 The Congress ruled Maharashtra for so long
 lekin kya kaaran tha ki congress ne apane kisi bhi mukhyamantri ko paanch saal nahin chalane diya
 The party has also taken some tough decisions
 ekanath khadse,vinod tavadeudaaharan hai
 These people have also been the face of the party, how did the party take this decision? Bhupendra Yadav: Whatever decisions the party takes are in a democratic way, from the bottom to the top, after discussion
 mere ko nahin lagata ki isko tikat kaatane jaisaa maananaa chahie

 People need to think about these promises

 He said, a large part of the cost of farmers is spent on water
 pani kii laagat buniyadi taur par bijli kii laagat ke kaaran he
 We have to understand the problem of farmers
 arvind kejariwal kii aguwai vaali dilli kii 'aap' sarkaar ne apane chunaav ghoshnaa-patr main bijli ke bill aadhe karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 Delhi has a demand of 5,000 MW of power and is mainly dependent on other states to meet its needs

 The introduction of a uniform tax system (gst-goods and Services Tax) across the country is set to be recorded in the history of Indian economics 
 kya yah faisla desh kii arthvyavastha ke liye terning point sabit hoga?is sawaal ke jawaab main kendra sarkaar or duniyabar ke kai arthshaastri samay-samay par daawa kar chuk he ki isse desh main kaarobaari maahaul sudharega
 This is because it will prove to be a milestone in the direction of the Doing Business
 vahiin is faisle se desh kii aarthik gatividhiyon main kai ahm badlaav dekhne ko milenge jiskaa sidhaa asar vikaas dar padegaa
 Why is GST so important? GST is going to change the tax system of the country
 is badlaav se sarkaar ke liye kaarobaar se tex vasuulana behad aasaan ho jayega
 Tax evasion will be curbed
 vahiin jiesti puri tarah se information technology (iti) par nirbhar rahegi
 Due to this, the government will have the accounts of the pie of the business going on in the country
 vahiin sarkaar ke liye tex vasuulne or tex kaa aankada rakhane ke kharch main badi katautee dekhne ko milegi
 All these changes will pave the way for the highest earning from the largest income source of the state governments, including the Center
 badalegaa kaarobaar kaa tarikajisti lagu hone se puraa desh ek bazaar ban jayega
 Industry in any corner of the country will get rid of dozens of different types of business tax on crossing the border of the states
 use uske kaarobaar menek samaan tex darpure desh main milegi or iske saath hi kaarobaar main tex maamalon kaa kaam karne kii laagat main badi katautee dekhne ko milegi
 All this work will be done digitally in an automated manner
 jitna kaarobaar utani kamaibeete 70 saal ke dauraan desh ke mahaj aadha darjan rajya aise jahaan sarkaar ko kaarobaari ke tex se badi kamai hoti he
 Important among them are Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu etc
 ye rajya audyogic gatividhi main sabase aage hai
 Obviously, the governments of these states have higher tax income and the resources to do business there are better than the rest of the states
 jiesti lagu hone ke baad, phaayde main na sirf vah rajya rahenge jahaan audyogic gatividhi adhik he balki vah rajya bhi shaamil hai jahaan khapat adhik he
 In such a situation, after the implementation of GST, a new industrial zone can be created in any corner of the country and the possibility of business boom will increase in all states
 aise main jaahir he ki sarkaar kii tex main kamai badhane se desh main kaarobaari teji ke sansaadhan jutaney kaa kaam aasaan ho jayega
 Integrated and simple tax regime is expected to pave the way for foreign investment
 in kaarnon se kendra sarkaar or aarthik jaankaron kaa daawa he ki desh kii vikaas dar ko raftaar milanaa tay he

 Thereafter, the proceedings of the House were adjourned sine die
 ise ek tarah se mayawati kii raajnneetik jeet ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 The Samajwadi Party accused the BSP government of being in the minority
 duusari ore basapa se nishkashit vidhayak or asantusht vidhayak bhi party ke liye sirdard ban sakate the
 If there was debate and then voting on the motion of no confidence, then the Mayawati government could be in trouble
 lakin chunki sadan kii kaarywahi anishchit kaal ke liye sthagit ho gai he, to maaya ke sar se ye musibat bhi philhal tal gai lagati he
 Significantly, a proposal was made by the Chief Minister of the state, Mayawati, to divide Uttar Pradesh, the country's largest state (by population) into four separate states
 jo rajya banenge wo honge harith pradesh, avadh pradesh, bundelkhand or purvanchal

 unhone kaha ki rahi baat anand kumaar kii to unke sanstha par janhit yachika daayar hui he to main is maamle main kuch bhi nahin kahuunga
 Till 2008, i was also associated with that organization, how did they keep the children, what did they feed and how much money did they take, because i was not involved with the management of that organization
 unhone kaha ki vah sirf vahaan padhaane jate the or kisi cheez se mujhe koi matlab nahin hota tha

 News doing rounds about change is not true -dr Vaidya The Election Commission has issued a notice against the BJP candidate from Begusarai and Union Minister Giriraj Singh, due to a controversial statement at a public rally during the Lok Sabha elections
 giriraaj singh ne party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke saamne manch se muslim samudaay ke logon ko chetavanee di thi ki agar kabr ke liye teen haath jagah chahie to is desh main vandemataram gaanaa hoga or bharat mata kii jai kahana hoga
 The reason for the notice by the Election Commission was Giriraj Singh's inflammatory and communal speech
 vah is maamle main hameshaa charchaa ke centre main rahe hai
 Giriraj Singh said during his speech at the party's national president Amit Shah's program on Wednesday, among other things, that some people want to spread the land of Bihar, spread communal fire, but the BJP is as long as Neither will this happen in Bihar nor will they allow this to happen on the land of Begusarai
 uske baad giriraaj ne rashtriya janata dal ke darbhanga se ummidavaar abdul baari siddiqui ke ek tathakthith vaktavy kii charchaa karte hue kaha tha ki 'RJD ke ummidavaar darbhanga main kehete hai ki vande maataram main nahin boluungaa
 In Begusarai, some people are coming and wearing the big brother's shirt and the younger brother's pajama
 lekin main unhen kahana chahta hum ki jo vande maataram nahin ga saktaa, jo bharat kii mathrubhumi ko naman nahin kar saktaa wo is baat ko yaad rakhen ki are giriraaj ke naanaa-dada simriya ghat main ganga nadi ke kinare mare, usee bhoomi par koi kabr nahin banaaya lekin tumhen to teen haath jagah chahie
 If you are not able to do this, the country will never forgive you
 'iske baad giriraaj ne apana bhaashan khatm kar diya lekin nishchit rup se bhaashan kaa yah ansh chaunkaane vaala tha
 However, experts believe that when Giriraj is on stage with Nitish Kumar, he talks about everyone's development and maintaining communal harmony, but when he is speaking on his platform and in front of senior leaders of his party If not, then they do not miss to target the people of the Muslim community

 LIVE: Arun Jaitley, no more, dies at age 66, read here Every update is known that Arun Jaitley met Narendra Modi while working in ABVP
 lekin baad ke dinon main in donon netaaon ke bich rishton ke majboot hone kaa ek silsilaa banataa chalaa gaya
 When i met Modi 
 
 angreji kii megsine kaaravaan main chhapi praveen donti kii report main dilli ke bijepi ke ek netaa ke hawaale se bataaya gaya he ki jetali ne bijepi kii 1991 kii rashtriya ekta yatra ke aayojak narendra modi kaa notice main liya tha
 (the Nawab of Najafgarh was married to Arun Jaitley's official bungalow) The report further states that 'of all the relationships that Jaitley has raised so far, his relationship with Narendra Modi goes back to the days when Modi was an ambitious campaigner Used to be unase, unka yah rishta, jo bhale hi vishwaas se zyada, paraspar phaayde kii buniyaad par tikaa he, ne unhen sabase zyada labhaansh diya he
 They complement each other in many ways
 ek prachlit netaa he, to duusare kii kuleen varg main paith he
 For one, the capital of the country is Delhi Pardes, while for the other, it is a well-known house
 ’report ke mutabik 1995 main jab gujarat main bijepi sarkaar satta main ai to modi ko dilli main kaam karne ke liye bheja gaya
 Jaitley was also among those with whom he strengthened his relationships
 unhone modi kaa vaise hi khyaal rakhaa jaise ve anya khaas logon kaa rakhte hai
 At that time no one else liked Modi, nor did anyone take him as seriously
 kai patrakaron or bijepi netaaon ko aaj bhi yaad he ki modi, jetali ke dakshin dilli vaale ghar main aksar dekhe jate the
 Arun Jaitley's name is the second name that comes after Amit Shah in the close proximity of modi-amit shah-jaitley pair
 2014 main india today ne piem modi, amit shah or arun jetali par ek cover story, ‘da induspencibl mistar jetali’ main likhaa gaya ki “maan liya jaae ki cross-puranic kathaayen aaj ke yug ke hindutv main istemaal main laai ja sakati hai to, isane likhaa, agar modi ram hai to shah or jetali unke lakshmana or arjuna hai

 ek taraf food sicyorti bill or duusari taraf arabon kii lut
 On the one hand, the question of filling the stomach of 82 crore people by distributing food grains on the one hand, and on the other, robbing billions and trillions of money by making a dent in the rights and needs of 125 crore people
 yani satta kaa hunar lut bhi he or lut kii rakam se bhukhe desh ko do june kii roti kaa jugad karaane kaa sapana bhi he
 For the first time in front of the country, the question is becoming bigger that after all why there are 80 crore people below the poverty line? And why are more than 80 crore people being provided resources to only 8 crore people in the country? The question is that on the one hand, from grain to water and education to treatment, few people are making billions of profits and the country 70 percent of the people do not have water, education and treatment
 agar dhyaan den to jo sarkaar food sicyorti bill ke jariye saste anaaj kii baat kar rahi he uske liye ek lakh karod kaa bajet he
 That is, there is every possibility of loot in the name of distribution of food grains, because every scheme of the government which is largely for the people, how its character is limited to loot can be understood only by the schemes of the government
 isaki ek baangi dekhie
 
 
 
 - manaregaa main lut
 - Plunder in rural health scheme
 - koyala khaadaan aanvaton main lut
 - Loot in Communication Infrastructure
 - ann bantwaare main lut
 - Loot in the relief package of farmers
 yani jahaan bhi sawaal desh ke bahusankhya tabake se judi yojanaon kaa hua he vahaan ghotaalaa or lut maujuuda vakt kaa nayab sach ban chukaa he
 And why the policies of the government strengthen the hands of private companies under government schemes and policies for the poor
 It can be understood from this that now when the government is talking about linking Congress's hand with the common man through the Food Security Bill
 If for the first time, the budget for distribution of food grains is one lakh crore and the budget of the Ministry of Agriculture of the country is not even half of it

 Talking walls published by Vani Prakashan
 
 When two characters whisper, they are 'heavy' to the reader's ears
 lekin jab ve bich bich main chote-chote antaraal par kavitaayen padhati he, to antarman main chote-chote bulbule footte hai or usase halki halki aawaaj ubhartee he irshaad
 
 irshaad
 Speaking walls
 
 Irshad is a written play
 jise padhate hue kai baar lagata he ki aap kisi mumbaiya film kii script pard rahe ho
 Irshad himself also says that 'this drama is the result of exhaustion of writing hundreds of songs on film love'
 lihaaja ab pathak ko yah tay karnaa he ki thakaavat kaa nateeja acha he yaa bura
 When writing a review of the play, when we look at the current scenario, its weight starts to increase
 prem karnaa jab jehad hone lage to bolti deevaaron ke kaanon ne lav jehad kaa shor bhi bhabhaka hoga
 In such a situation, if 'wasim' loves 'pooja' in any living society today, it is possible that Love would have been declared as a Jihadi and no one knows what would happen to him
 haalanki irshaad kamil kaa ‘wasim’ is myne main lucky he or use pujari ke rup main ek bhala hindu aadmi miltaa he, jo dadhi rakhane vaale musalmaan ko apane mandir main sharan detaa he or uski raksha karata he
 Irshad's 'speaking walls' have been successful in conveying their message
 nadaan parinde
 
 
 And Sadda Haq
 
 Like Irshad, who wrote Manikhej songs, his play seems weak because of his dialogue
 naatak kaa shilp or sanrachana film se prabhavit he or isamen naatakeey mode bhi he
 Devi: Don't look like this
 
 Wasim has told me everything
 puujaikya bataaya usne aapako?
 
 
 Told me my pain, my pain, my instant death? 
 
 mere jeene kaa kaaran bataaya
 
 
 Cited the reason for my confusion and madness
 
 
 lekin main uski jalan ko jaanati hum
 
 
 i know why he told my father-in-law that i am not auspicious for Ranjit
 
 
 jab hindu or musalmanka prem ‘lav jehad’ hone lage, to yah naatak praasangik ho jaataa he
 Even if the case of 'love Jihad' applies to the middle class and those living below the poverty line
 kyonki ucch varg ke liye to iskaa koi auchity hi nahin he
 Through the love story of Pooja and Wasim with their characters Pujari, his wife Devi, Irshad Kamil stands in the mirror in today's situation
 taaki prem par raajnneeti kar hindu-musalmaan ke bich lakeer khinchne vaale apana cheharaa nihaar saken
 The anti-romeo squad formed by the Yogi government in Uttar Pradesh to curb the safety and misdeeds of women, has been in discussion for arbitrary and harassing innocents many times

 Guidelines were also violated, however, some new rules have been framed by the UP Police Director Javed Ahmed for the Anti Romeo Squad
 isamen kaha gaya he ki pakde gaye romeo ko ganja naa kiya jaae, unke munh par kaalikh naa potee jaae or naa hi murga banane kii sajaa di jaae
 Also, in the name of caste, creed or faith, it has also been asked not to discriminate

 apni paaltu billi kaa aadhaar card banavaane ke aarope main kerala ke kaasragod jile main police ne ek enarai ajij abdulla ke khilaaf aapraadhik maamla darj kiya he
 Apart from nris, the police has also accused an IT based service delivery center employee in the case
 angreji akhbaarad indian expreski khabar ke mutabik, aadhaar form par billi kii tasviir dekhne ke baad adhikariyon ko maamle kaa pataa chal paaya
 The police took this step following a complaint from the 'unique Identification Authority of India' (UIDAI)
 darasal, abdulla apni paaltu billi kovidesh le janachahte the, lekin jab travel agent ne unhen bataaya ki billi ko baahar le jane ke liye bairiphication document kii jarurat hogi, tab abdulla ne billi ke liye aadharcard banavaaneka faisla kiya
 The employee of the Aadhar Card Center accepted the application of the fake name Ceballi
 karmchaaree ne billi kii tasviir aplod karne ke saath card banane kii kaarywahi bhi shuru kar di thi
 After police registered a case, Abdullah apologized for his actions

 Attacking Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Haryana Health Minister Anil Vijane said that Kejriwal must first prove his existence and ensure that the scattered trust of the people of Delhi can be restored

 Citing Kejriwal's instructions for Delhi departments, Anil Vij tweeted, 'kejriwal first prove his existence
 unke is coment ne aag main ghi kaa kaam kiya or kejariwal kii team ne is par tippaniyan kerani shuru kar deen
 Vij also alleged that Kikjeriwal has always adopted the policy of 'use and Throw'
 pehle unhone lokapal bill kii aad main limlite main aane ke liye anna hajaare kaa istemaal kiya
 Today, not only has he forgotten Anna, but he has also forgotten the words of his Lokpal bill
 ab unhone yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 Therefore, first of all, Kejriwal must prove his own existence

 In fact, he once advised Shami to try to become a dangerous bowler using reverse swing
 shoeb akhtar ne 6 saal pehle hi rohit sharma se kaha tha- apane naam ke aage g laga loshoeb akhtar ne kaha, 'world cap ke baad mujhe shami kaa phone aayaa
 He was deeply disappointed by the defeat of Hindustan
 unhen is baat kaa dukh tha ki vah aakhri match (semifinal) main khel nahin paae
 i comforted them
 maine shami se kaha ki is vakt aap form ho or fitness ko dekhte hue behatar sthiti main ho
 You walk with Virat Kohli
 'shoeb akhtar ne tab shami se aane vaali siries kii baat kahi thi, 'home siries (south africa ke khilaaf) aane vaali he or aap apni fitness banaae rakhen

 ' shoeb akhtar ne shami kii tareef karte hue kaha, 'unke paas acchhee seem or swing he

 shoeb akhtar ne kaha, 'ab dekhie, unhone kya kiya
 Shami took wickets on a poor pitch
 main unke liye khush hum
 Many records made by Shami blowing off the senses of Africa, deadly bowling, Shoaib Akhtar said that he is ready to advise Pakistani pacers, but no one is asking him for help
 unhone kaha, 'afsos kii baat he ki hamaare pakistani tej gendbaaj mujhase nahin poochhate hai ki ve apni gendbaaji main kaise sudhaar kar sakate hai, lekin shami jaise bhartiya gendbaaj aisa kar rahe hai

 The government's top lawyer Anil Singh said, "the fish dies as soon as it is taken out of the water, so there is no slaughter involved
" unhone court ke samaksh jo spashtikaran diya, uskaa aashay tha ki koi vadh nahin hona chahie

 On April 14, on the occasion of the 127th birth anniversary of Bhimrao Ambedkar, the Union Ministry of Information Technology organized an event at Patna's five-star Hotel Maurya to empower the people of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes
 isamen mukhya atithi kendriya mantri ravi shankar prasad the, magar is puure kaarykram ko lekar vivaad tab ho gaya jab ravishankar prasad ne five star hotel main daliton ke saath din kaa bhojan kiya
 In fact, on the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti, between April 14 and May 5, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has instructed all his central ministers to go to Dalit settlements, listen to their problems and have a day meal with them
 ambedkar jayanti ke maukey par shanivaar ko ravishankar prasad, bihar ke mantri nandakishor yadav or sthaneey vidhayak sanjeev chaurasia or nitin naveen ke saath patna ke china kothi dalit basti main jarur gaye or logon kii samasyaayein bhi suni
 During this, Ravishankar Prasad garlanded Ambedkar's photograph at China Kothi and laid the foundation of a wooden bridge after which he left for the Maurya Hotel
 tay kaarykram ke mutabik ravishankar prasad ko dalit basti main logon ke saath bhojan karne kaa kaarykram bhi tha, magar maury hotel main apane mantralay se ek kaarykram kaa hawala dekar vah vahaan se nikal gaye
 After Ravi Shankar Prasad left, Nandkishore Yadav and BJP mlas Sanjeev Chaurasia and Nitin Naveen dined with Dalits at Vidyapati Bhavan
 badha vivadamgar vivaad yaheen nahin thama
 The controversy escalated when Ravi Shankar Prasad had a dinner at this five-star hotel with Dalit women present at the event after the Maurya Hotel program ended, whose pictures and videos went viral

 Setu Nigam chairman Rajan Mittal has alleged that the Varanasi administration did not cooperate with him
 kai baar is raste ko band karne kii chitthee likhi gai, lekin ulte varanasi prashasan ne unke adhikariyon par cese kar diya
 This is the reason that he had to build this bridge in the open way
 sethu nigam ke in aaropon se tilamilaae varanasi prashasan ne kaha he ki unke paas dastavejon kaa puraa chittha maujuud he
 In this, he has given full administrative help to Setu Nigam to build this bridge, this is not the first bridge
 isse pehle sethu nigam ke 3 pul banakar taiyaar ho chuke hai or jitne bhi patrachaar hue hai vah sabhi is ore ishaara karte hai ki prashasan se kahin koi chook nahin hui he
 Varanasi DM Yogeshwar Ram Mishra told 'aaj Tak' that the administration has given all the cooperation that the bridge corporation has asked them to build this bridge, whether it is for widening of roads, removal of religious places from the road
 To strengthen the traffic system
 sab kuch prashasan ne kiya he lekin haadase ke baad is tarah kii bayaanbaji kii vajah unhen samaj nahin aa rahi he
 Yogeshwar Ram Mishra said that Setu Nigam should have acted like a metro surrounded by a sheet of tin from all four sides, but they did not do so in most places
 nirmaanadhin pul ke donon ore trephic band karne kii sethu nigam kii maang par dm ne kaha ki yah shahar kaa sabase mahatvapurn sadak he jisamen railway stesan, bas stand se lekar airport ko jodne vaali ekmaatr sadak he
 In such a situation, it cannot be closed
 saaf he yogi sarkaar ke do vibhaag or do agenciyaan is haadase ke baad aamane-saamne hai or yah sarkaar kii or kirakiri karaane ke liye kaaphi he
 Hello i Ravish Kumar



 jab aap kisi netaa yaa patrkaar ke shrimukh se muslim vot bank sunate hai to aapke man main koun-koun si chhaviyaan ubhartee hai
 i gess kya aap yah samajhate hai ki muslim vot bank ke sadsy kisi islamic dharmik chetana se prerit hokar vot karte hai, kisi maulavee ke kehane par hi vot karte hai, unke bich raajnneetik dalon ko lekar koi bhed nahin hota, ve kabhi muddon ke liye vot nahin karte muslim vot bank sirf musalmaan ko vot karata he
 Now these images are not going to break through prime time alone
 vaise bhi main yodagan virdohi patrkaar hum
 Does not want to contribute good or bad
 saral hindi main musalmaan vah he jo islam kaa paalan karata he
 But followers of Islam are divided into several sects
 shiya, sunni, wahabi, devbandi, barelvi, daudi, vohara
 In India, Muslims are divided into many castes
 agada-pichhadaa, amiri-garibi kaa bhed he
 These days, backward and Dalit Muslims are fighting for their separate political identity
 phir bhi ham ekamusth sawaal karte hai ki musalmaan kidar jayega, kyonki raajnneetik dalon ko lagata he ki khaali pade stadium main hajaar-paanch sau musalamaanon ko bulaakar bhaashan de dene se musalamaanon se samvaad ho jaataa he
 This conscience of a common Muslim voter is not communalized by calling it a Muslim vote bank
 phir paswan, kushvaha yaa yadav vot bank muslim vot bank se kaise alag he
 Why no one talks on Muslim issues
 kya unhen dangon ke sandarbh main hi dekha jaataa rahegaa
 Now come to forgiveness
 rahul pandita ne da hindu main likhaa he ki maafee in dinon rashtriya pastime he
 i sound like safi
 prachaar kaa aarope na lage to hamaare netaa saafee kii tarah maafee maafee kar rahe hai
 i do not know how to clean the blood or to forgive the blood
 kisi kanoon main hatya ke aropiyon ke liye maafee kaa praavdhaan nahin he
 The question of morality has gone into the trough itself
 is maafee shabd kaa prayog do netaaon ke liye ho rahaa he
 One is Narendra Modi and the other is Rahul Gandhi
 gujarat ke liye nahin maanga to sikh narsanhaar ke liye nahin maanga
 Journalists are waiting for some day to know when these two leaders will come to the balcony and say sorry and then everyone will start saying happy apology - happy apology after seeing the moon of Eid
 rajnath singh kaa bayaan aata he ki agar hamase kuch galat hua he to sheesh jhukaa kar maafee maangenge
 So everyone thinks that forgiveness is going to happen
 ek or prasang chal rahaa he clin chit kaa
 The Supreme Court said that there is not enough evidence to prosecute Narendra Modi
 kai dalon ne ise raajnneetik vivaad ke ant hone ke maukey kii tarah dekha
 Now it is not known if Tytler and Sajjan Kumar get a clean chit in the absence of sufficient evidence, what will they do? teen farvari ke indian express main vinay sitapati ne likhaa he ki congress or enjio ne dangon main modi kii bhoomika par jarurat se zyada jor diya jiske kaaran baaki dangai ke aparaadh or unki raajnneetik prishthbhumi ke sawaal peeche rah gaye hai
 The battle for justice became suspicious
 sitapati apane shodh ke jariye bataate hai ki dangon ke gujarat sarkaar dangon ke jin maamalon kii jaanch or mukadmaa lard rahi he, unamem 12 saal baad sirf paanch pratishat maamalon main sajaa hui he, jabaki supreme court kii nigaraanee main chale maamalon main sajaa 39 pratishat hui he
 Both Sitapati and Rahul Pandita say what was Modi's riot in Gujarat to make Maya Kodnani a minister and the Congress in Delhi make HKL Bhagat a minister? Maya Kodnani is currently in jail
 sitapati ke lekh main kisi najir khan pathan kaa ek bayaan he, ‘donon hamen daraate hai
 One Hindu scares us to get votes, another one to take our vote
 ham is maafee maang ko muslim vot kii prachlit raajnneeti ke sandarbh main samajhnaa chaahate hai
 It is a fact that Muslims vote for BJP
 shat pratishat to vah kisi ek gaiyr bijepi dal ko bhi nahin detaa
 The question is whether the BJP gives tickets to Muslims
 bijepi ne pichley november main hue chaar rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon main 611 ummidavaar utaare jisamen se sirf 6 musalmaan the
 Four were given tickets in Rajasthan and two won
 usase pehle gujarat or karnataka main ek bhi ummidavaar nahin diya
 Whereas in these election rallies, the BJP showed a lot of how many people came in burqas and how many in hats
 congress ne gujarat, karnataka, rajasthan, chhattisgarh, madhya pradesh or dilli main kul milakar 54 musalamaanon ko hi tikat die
 There is no specific record
 to sawaal yahaan bhagidaari kaa he yaa maafee kaa yaa clin chit kaa
 Today's Times of India reports that the captain of a cargo vessel saving the lives of 722 Indians, Zainul Abidin, did not find a home in the Branda area
 vah kharidne gaye to brokar ne bataaya ki jis sosayadi main aap chaahate hai vahaan alikhit niyam he
 Neither a Muslim has to sell a house nor rent it
 iske khilaaf kabhi bhi aap do dalon ke bade netaaon ko aahvaan karte nahin sunenge

 If you are a public figure,you are open to criticism

 He (trump) was constantly talking to my boyfriend and then he kept distance from the boyfriend
 usne (trump) mere bwoyfriend ko dinar ke liye inwit kiya or kehane laga ki agar tum log neuyork main ho to atlantic city aa sakate ho
 You can stay in my hotel mujhe apana number do

 unhone kaha, 'vah mujhe baahar chalane ke liye kah rahaa tha or main kah rahi thi ki apane bwoyfriend kaa kya karun? kya main pagal hum? tum mujhe baahar chalane ke liye kah rahe ho? tum jaanate ho ki meraa bwoyfriend he
 Salma said, claiming that Trump's answer was' That's not very good for you
 uskaa hona koi myne nahin rakhata, vah tumhaare liye kaaphi nahin, tumhen mere saath baahar chalanaa chahie

 nilesh rane ne swargeey shivasena pramukh baalsaheb thakare par aarope lagaate hue kaha tha, 'unhone bollywood ke charchit singer sonu nigam kii hatya kii sajeesh rachi thi
 At his behest, Shiv Sainiks also tried to kill Sonu Nigam
 'video main dekhen sonu nigam kaa riekshaupane aaropon main rane ne yah bhi kaha, 'raajnneeti karte hue hamane kabhi bhi bal thakare ke bare main galat chijen nahin kahin
 Despite this, my father Narayan Rane has been accused of dirty allegations

 desh ke pratishthit ejineering santhaan iaiti main is baar admician lene main chaatro ne zyada dilchaspee nahin dikhaai
 This time 650 seats were left vacant and no one came for admission
 ek hindi dainik ke mutabik aisa isliye hua ki nae iaiti main chaatr-chaatraon kii khaas ruchi nahin thi or uske alaava kuch aise vishay bhi hai jinamein chaatro kii dilchaspee nahin thi kyonki ve kariyar ke lihaaj se bahut utsahvardhak nahin hai
 IITJEE Advance Counseling chief MK Panigrahi said that in the first phase, students enrolled in 9,061 seats in the counseling of 9,711 seats
 ek anya professor ne bataaya ki yah sankhya to un chaatro kii he jinhone daakhila nahin liya
 There are still those students who will withdraw admission
 pichhali baar se IIT main chaatr admician lene ke baad apana naam waapas lene lage hai
 The reason for this is that they take admission in nits or good private engineering colleges instead of new iits
 ek or kaaran yah he ki dakshin bharat ke IIT main uttar ke chaatr khaane-pine ke kaaran admician lene se kataraate hai
 Some students' parents do not want their children to go that far
 is baar IIT ne kuch vishyon kii padhai band kar di he kyonki unamem chaatr daakhila nahin lete hai or kai baar bich se hi chhod dete hai
 Students feel that there is not much future in those subjects in India

 But since the resignation of Najeeb Jung, many names have started floating in political circles
 soshal media par bhi log nae alji ke naam ko lekar sambhavit ummidavaaron ke bare main apni raay rakh rahe hai
 On Twitter, names like BS Bassi and Kiran Bedi are being mocked by the Kejriwal government
 kiran bedi ko aglaa up rajyapal banaae jane ke samarthan main twitor par # bedi4delhilg trend kar rahaa he
 People feel that if Kiran Bedi, the next Lieutenant Governor of Kodilli is created, she can give the right answer to CM Arvind Kejriwal who continues to curse the Modi government at the Center
 vaise to kejariwal sarkaar kaa najeeb jang se bhi takaraav hota rahaa or up rajyapal par modi sarkaar ke ishaare par kaam karne kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa rahaa
 The Delhi government kept saying repeatedly that the Modi government kept hindering them from doing any public interest in the national capital
 aise main agar bedi ko dilli kaa up rajyapal banaaya jaataa he to centre sarkaar kejariwal sarkaar ko sahi tareeke se counter kar paaegi
 Twittermen feel that it will not be easy for Kejriwal to raise questions about Bedi's honesty
 dilli ke siem kejariwal khud ko sabase eemaandaar netaa bataate hai
 Perhaps this is the reason why the people of Delhi took him head-on
 kiran bedi kaa trek record bhi saaf suthra rahaa he
 Incidentally, both have been together in Anna Hazare's 'india Against Corruption' movement
 kiran bedi kii image ek tej-tarraar ipies afasar ke taur par rahi he
 She is being called 'lady Singham' on Twitter
 log maan rahe hai ki agar bedi dilli kii up rajyapal banaai jaati hai to kejariwal ke liye dilli main suraksha or lau and order ko lekar sawaal uthaanaa bhi mushkil hoga jo siem banane ke baad kejariwal aksar karte rahete hai
 They have also been demanding that the Delhi Police be given control of the Delhi government
 kiran bedi is vakt puducheri kii up rajyapal hai
 He has been in the post for 6-7 months
 vahaan par unke kaamon kii charchaa aae din hoti rahati he
 In this way, he has also got experience of working in the post of Deputy Governor
 log is vajah se bhi unka samarthan kar rahe hai
 Apart from this, if Kiran Bedi becomes LG of Delhi, then she will be the first woman LG of Delhi
 aise main twitor par log maan rahe hai ki dilli or khaskar rashtriya rajdhani main mahilaon kii suraksha ko lekar dharna badalane main madad milegi
 Some funny tweets on 'bedi vs Kejriwal' Sir Ravindra Jadeja @sirjadeja says, 'if Kiran Bedi is made the Deputy Governor of Delhi, CM Kejriwal will resign
 'milind Wakhale @mwakhale ne likhaa he, 'najeeb jang to sirf ek naam tha, kejri ke saath jang to ab shuru hogi
 'sharwan Kumar @ sharwanmatwa111 says,' @thekiranbedi is the best option for the Lt

 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye congress ne aupchaarik taur par shanivaar ko elaan kar diya he ki bhopal seat se purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh chunaav ladenge
 In the afternoon before this announcement, Chief Minister Kamal Nath announced the candidature of Digvijay in an informal conversation with journalists
 kamalnath ke bayaan par pratikriya dete hue digvijay ne kaha tha ki wo rajgad se ladanaa chahenge lekin saath hi ye bhi jod diya ki party jaisaa nirdesh degi wo uskaa paalan karenge
 Digvijay has been an MP from Rajgarh 2 times
 lekin kya is faisle se digvijay khush hai, siem kamalnath se jab ye sawaal poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki 'ye sawaal aapako unase poochna chaiye, main is faisle se khush hum
 The state president of Digvijay Party has been the chief minister two times
 If you fight Rajgarh, this does not suit you
 maine unase anurodh kiya tha ki aap bhopal, jabalpur yaa indore se laden unhone kaha main isapar sochataa hum
 
 
 Then he told me that if you decide, then i decided that he will fight Bhopal
 'is maamle main digvijay ne pratikriya dete hue kaha ki vaise to main 2020 tak rajyasabha kaa sadsy hum, lekin phir bhi yadi party chaahati he ki main loksabhaa main jaaun to meri pehali praathamikta rajgad he jahaan se main voter bhi hum
 But despite that, i have told my party president and the state Congress i
e
 Kamal Nathji that i will fight from where the party wants to fight
 bataa den ki pichley hafte kamalnath ne kaha tha ki digvijay ko rajya kii sabase kathin seat se chunaav ladanaa chaiye
 Bhopal has been the bjp's stronghold for the last 3 decades, BJP candidates have won from here in all the eight elections held since 1989
 At present, this seat is occupied by bjp's Alok Sanjar
 1989 se 3 dafe is seat ko susheel chandra verma ne jeeta ise baad uma bharti, or purv mukhyamantri kailash joshi bhopal se saansad rahe
 It is discussed that after cutting the ticket of Alok Sanjar from this seat, General Secretary VD Sharma or Mayor Alok Sharma can be given the ticket, but after the candidature of Digvijay, there is also talk of fighting of former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan from this seat
 udhar maalegaanv dhamaakaa maamle se bari hui sadhvi pragna singh thakur bhi taal thonk rahi hai
 On the question of exposing Pragya Thakur, Digvijay said, i will try my best to fight whom BJP wants to fight
 vahiin bijepi kii daavedaari or digvijay kii chunauti ke sawaal par party pravaktaa rahul kothaari ne kaha hamaara koi bhi rashtravaadi kaaryakarta unhen chunauti de saktaa he
 This is an internal battle of the Congress in which Digvijay is being implicated and defeated to defeat him so that his interference in the politics of the state ends
 saare matadaata unki rashtravirohi or bantaadhaar kii chhavi ko jaanate hai
 When the country is moving forward under the leadership of Modiji, then why will Bhopal be backward by voting for Digvijay Singh

 In her book 'lata Mangeshkar: In Her Own Voice' written by Nasreen Munni Kabir and published by Niyogi Books, Lata has said that when i was a child i always wanted to meet Sehgal ji
 tab main bahut choti thi to main aksar kaha karti thi ki main badi hokar sahagal sahab se shaadi karuungi
 My father used to say jokingly that by then he would have grown old
 phir bhi main yah kahati thi ki koi baat nahin main phir bhi unase shaadi kar luungi
 But Lata never met Sehgal
 unhone kaha ki mujhe is baat kaa behad afsos he ki main kabhi unase mil nahin pai
 i would like to thank his brother Mahendra Sehgal that because of him i was able to meet Sehgal Sahab's wife Asharani and his children
 unke putr ne mujhe sahagal sahab se sambandhit anguthi bhi di
 The book also has many interesting episodes of conversation between Lata and London's short story producer Kabir

 a post shared by Dosti Ke Side Effects Official (@dostikesideeffectsofficial) on Dec 4, 2018 at 2:27am PST The results of the Lok Sabha elections have come and it is almost clear that with full majority Narendra Modi will again take over the throne of Delhi
 ajtak-exis maai india ke agsit pole ne bhi piem modi kii banpar voton se dobaaraa satta main vaapasi kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi, jo sateek sabit hui

 is baat kaa prachaar prasar bhi jamkar kiya gaya ki 26 / 11 mumbai hamale ke baad sena jawaab dena chaahati thi lekin manmohan singh sarkaar ne use isaki ijaajat nahin di
