 desh kii ganga-jamuni tahjeeb ko tabah karne kaa thekabijepi netaa subrahmanyam swamine le rakhaa he
 Swami's new statement has raised voices of protest from every corner of Assam
 bijepi netaa subrahmanyam swami ne haal hi guwahati main kaha ki masjid koi dharmik sthaan nahin he or ise kisi bhi samay todaa ja saktaa he
 Swamy's statement has drawn strong opposition in the state and a case has also been registered against him
 swami ne apane bayaan ke paksh main saudi arab kaa ek udhaaharan pesh kiya, jahaan sadaken banane ke liye masjidon ko jameendoj kar diya gaya
 He said, 'the mosque is not a religious place, it is just a building
 ise kabhi bhi giraaya ja saktaa he
 If anyone disagrees with my opinion, i am willing to argue with him on this issue
 mujhe yah jaankaree saudi arab ke logon se mili
 'swami also claimed that all Indian Muslims were first Hindus
 is bayaan kaa virodh karte hue rajya ke kai sanghathanon ne bijepi netaa ke putale jalaae
 The Assam Waqf Board, All Assam Minority Students Union and other Muslim organizations have demanded action against Swamy, while an institution named Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti has filed sections 120 (b) (criminal conspiracy) and 153 of IPC against Swamy
 FIR was also registered under (A) (creating enmity between communities on the basis of religion)
 sanstha ke adhyaksh akhil gogoi ne kaha, 'vidhansabha chunaav se pehle bijepi rajya main sampradayik bhaavana bhadakaana chaahati he
 Swamy's controversial statement against Muslims is part of this conspiracy
 ham isaki aalochana karte hai or assam sarkaar se maang karte hai ki rajya main swami ke pravesh par pratibandh lagaaya jaae
 On the other hand, Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi also criticized Subramanian Swamy and BJP, saying, 'BJP has to pay the price for hurting the sentiments of the Assamese
 ' idhar, bayaan ke khilaaf logon kaa aakrosh bhaanp kar bijepi kii rajya ikai ne swami ke is bayaan se kinaaraa kar liya he
 BJP state president Siddharth Bhattacharya said, 'these are Swamy's personal statements, not our party's, but, we will write to our central leadership on this issue
 ' The city has just woken up from a sleep
 guuruuvaar kii shaam hue bhayanak bam dhamaakon se hyderabad sahamaa hua he
 Charminar is silent
 haalanki dilsukh nagar se dhuna hat chukaa he, lekin police bairicade ke bheetar pade khun ke chhinte abhi puri tarah sookhe nahin hai
 Suddenly a bomb explodes and a few moments ago, the movement of people, shopping women, running children, glittering shops and lighters, Dulsukh Nagar started burning in black flames
 kya insaan, kya dukaan, sabakuch kachare ke dher main tabdeel ho gaye
 Now the accident has passed but left behind a lot of questions
 aakhir koun he in dhamaakon ke peeche?is aatanki hamale main 17 logon kii jaan ja chuki he, jabaki 124 log ghayal hai
 Before the attack, the terrorists had gathered a lot of information about the city
 masalan, jahaan visphot hue, vah hyderabad kaa sabase vyast ilaaka he, jahaan dinabhar bheed lagi rahati he
 The first blast took place near the Venkatadari theater and a few minutes later the second blast took place near the Dilsukhnagar cross road, where the Konark theater is and is quite crowded
 dilasukhanagar vyavsaayik or shikshan sansthaanon kaa centre he
 The bombings occurred at a time when large numbers of people, including students, were going to their homes and crowds of people gathered at food shops including theaters
 pehla dhamaakaa hone par afratfari or bhagdad much gai
 After the people could understand something, only after that another explosion took place
 dhuna chantane main thodaa vakt laga
 Then people went somewhere and saw that people are lying here and there in a dead and dying state
 police ko yah pataa lagane main zyada vakt nahin laga ki donon bam iidi the or unhen cycle main feet kiya gaya tha
 These bombs had a timer and both had a time gap of just a few minutes
 jaanch agenciyon kii ab tak kii tafteesh se jo tasviir ubharkar ai he, uske mutabik is khooni hamale ke peeche indian mujahidin (iem) kaa haath hone kii ashanka jaahir kii ja rahi he
 According to sources, the Indian Mujahideen, a front organization of Lashkar, had taken help of locals associated with SIMI for the blast
 sutron ke mutabik khun kii yah holi achaanak nahin kheli gai
 Surprisingly, the Andhra Pradesh Police already knew that there was a possibility of a terrorist attack in the city and for this the terrorists had also committed Reiki here at least three months ago
 iem ke pakade gaye aatanki saiyad makabool urf juber ne pichley saal aktubar main khulaasa kiya tha ki hyderabad ke dilasukhanagar, begum bazaar or abdais aatankiyon ke nishane par hai
 The question is, why did the police not become alert after the disclosure of Maqbool? Why were adequate security arrangements not made in view of any such attack, when this was disclosed by a prominent IM terrorist himself
 pune serial blast main aaropee makabool ne mumbai police ke jaanchakartaaon ko yah bhi bataaya tha ki usne apane saathiyon ko aatanki hamalon main istemaal kii jane vaali improvizd explosive divaais banane kaa prashikshan diya tha
 There are two specific reasons for the investigative agencies to turn to Sui's IM
 pehla bam bananaa or doosraa use lagaana
 Investigation so far has determined that ammonium nitrate, fuel oil and timers were used in the bomb
 saath hi donon bamon ko cycle main rakhe tiffin box main plant kiya gaya tha
 IM has also used bicycles in the 2008 bomb blasts in Delhi and Jaipur
 usne in donon blast kii jimmedaari bhi lee thi
 Investigative agencies believe that IM boss Riyaz Bhatkal sent another man along with terrorists Imran and Akram to Reiki in Hyderabad's Dilsukh Nagar area in June 2012
 imran vahi shaks he, jisane pune ke best bekri bam blast ko anjaam diya tha
 Meanwhile, security agencies are trying to scour old contacts of IM by sending their teams to Ahmed Nagar and Nanded in Maharashtra
 ummid he ki vahaan se kuch ahm suraag mil sakate hai
 The suspicion of security agencies trying to find clues deepened with IM when Asadullah Abrar, a fugitive member of IM, was discovered to be in Mumbai three days before the blast
 us par 10 lakh ru
 The reward of has also been announced
 iem par shaq kii sui ghoomane ke saath sawaalon kii ungali sarkaar or police kii taraf bhi gumti he ki is baat kii jaankaree hone ke baavjood ki dilasukhanagar sahit hyderabad ke kai ilaake aatankiyon ke nishane par hai, police ne in jagahon kii nigaraanee badhaane kii koshish kyon nahin kii? ajmal kasaab or afjal guru kii faansee ke baad se hi pakistani aatanki sanghathanon kii ore se lagaataar badla lene kii dhamkiyaan mil rahi thim
 Strong supporters of many of these organizations, including IM, are also present in India
 kendriya grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia ne bhi visphot ke baad bataaya ki andhra pradesh sahit sabhi rajyon main aatanki hamalon kii chetavanee jari kii gai thi
 Since his coalition partners and the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh were present with him, Shinde had to say that the warning was not for a specific time or place
 andhra pradesh ke dijipi dinesh reddy ke mutabik, ‘‘neshnal invastegative agency ne andhra pradesh sahit sabhi rajyon ko mahaj suzav diya tha ki aisi koi ghatana ho sakati he
 Meanwhile, the Hyderabad government has set up a special force called Octopus to counter the terrorists
 iske liye 30,000 pulicekarmi bhartee karne ko bhi manjuuri mil gai he
 The Police Counter Intelligence Unit in the Intelligence Department has also been strengthened, but none of them could stop the bleeding of innocent people on the streets of Dilsukhnagar on Thursday
 hyderabad kaa puraa maahaul darasal ek jwalamukhi kii tarah ho gaya he jo kabhi-bhi fat padataa he

 In an interview on Aaj Tak, Kejriwal described himself as a warrior of the crusade and said that the fight is between the Pandavas and the Kauravas, then the answer came from the Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Vijender Gupta
 gupta ne kaha ki dharmayuddh main kaurav yaa pandav nahin balki kejariwal ravan hai
 Vijender Gupta said that Kejriwal should be ashamed of what he insulted the soldiers of the country and questioned the surgical strike
 aajkal kejariwal pakistan kii topi pahane hue hai or har chiz ko raajnneetik chashmen se dekhte hai
 According to Gupta, Kejriwal seeks political advantage in everything, so he is not deterred by doing politics on the funeral pyre of martyrs

 gupta ne kaha ki badi-badi baaten karne se koi bada nahin banataa balki bada banane ke liye bade kaam karne hote hai, lekin kejariwal sirf or sirf raajnneeti karne main lage hue hai
 In a year and a half, Vijender Gupta contested the claim of working more than BJP ruled states and said that Kejriwal should look towards Delhi and work for Delhi and then talk about other parts of the country
 kejariwal ke daavon ko hawa hawaii bataate hue vijendra gupta ne kaha ki dilli kii janata vikaas ke kaamon ke liye bhatak rahi he, jabaki kejariwal kaa focus sirf duusare rajyon kii taraf he
 Kejriwal has put his full strength for the Punjab elections and is using Delhi's money in it

 Modi said, "after the formation of the new government, i will request the Supreme Court to hear the pending cases against all the mps within a year

 ’ Film Name: 'rustom' Director: Tinu Suresh Desaistar Cast: Akshay Kumar, Ileana d'cruz, Isha Gupta, Arjan Bajwa, Kumud Mishra, Pawan Malhotraratting: 3 Star Akshay Kumar's crime thriller film 'rustom' has been released
 tinu suresh desai ke nirdesan main bani yah film nanaavati cese se prerit he
 The film's writer is Vipul's Rawal and producer Neeraj Pandey who has directed the Akshay Kumar starrer films 'special 26' and 'baby'
 kahaneerustampavari (akshay kumaar) ek neval officer ke kirdaar main he, jisaki shaadi sinthya (eliana decruige) se hoti he or phir rustam apni naukari ke silsile main jahaaj par chalaa jaataa he or isi dauraan rustam ke dost vikram se sinthya kii nazdikiyaan badhati hai or unke bich afaire shuru ho jaataa he
 When Rustom gets to know about this whole matter, he gets furious, he goes to Vikram and asks why all this happened and there is a debate between the two and Vikram is killed at the hands of Rustom
 phir shuru hoti he court kii kaarywahi jisamen rustam kii jindagi main nayaa mode aa jaataa he
 In the screenplay-inspired life, the fictions are threaded in a funky way, but the first part could have been more tight if 2 songs had been reduced and the film could have been editing and sharpening, but after the interval the film's pace picks up and The film manages to tie up until the end
 iske alaava 50 or 60 ke dashak kaa mumbai shahar or behatar lag saktaa tha
 Talk about art direction, nothing too special, despite the good story, the director does not save the film from the cliched formulas, like Akshay's argument with the lawyer in the court room scenes seems one sided, the lawyer seems stupid rather than vicious is
 abhinavkshay kumaarane ek baar phir sabit kar diya he ki mauka milane par wo koi bhi kirdaar bakhubi nibhaa sakate hai, ek neval officer kis tarah chalata he baat karata he, akshay ne kirdaar ko baqayada jiya he or film kii kuch kamajoriyaan unke abhinay se chhip jaati hai, pawan malhotra investegating officer ke kirdaar main khub jame hai, kumud mishra ne parsi akhbaar ke maalik ke taur par kamaal kaa abhinay kiya he, film main kuch hansi ke pal kumud kii vajah se hi hai
 The work of Ileana Dikruz, Arjan Bajwa, the rest of the co-stars is also commendable

 dharmashala test main viraat kohli chot ke kaaran khel nahin paae lekin ajinkya rahane kii aguwai main team india ke khilaadiyon ne unhen siries jeet kaa yaadgaar tohfa diya
 After the match, Virat said, "unbelievable!" This is our best series win ever

 He exemplified the ability to struggle, and showed the maturity of amazing

 Kohli said that Ajinkya led the team well
 apni fitness main sudhaar ke hamane jo prayaas kiye hai, ve parinaam dene lage hai
 The players performed amazingly throughout the season
 isse pehle kuch aise seshan rahe the jisamen hamane aasaani se haar maan lee thi lekin is siries main aisa nahin hua
 The kind of fitness the fast bowlers showed and their willingness to take wickets should be praised
 dharmashala main team india ke kaaryvahak captain ajinkya rahane ne kaha ki captaini kaa maine lutf uthaaya
 The credit for this win goes to all the players
 hamaare ballebaajon, gendbaajon, fielderon sabane acha pradarshan kiya
 On the first day of the test, we had decided at lunch that we would have to stop the runs of the opposition team
 yadi hamane aisa kiya or ekaadh wicket lene main safal ho gaye to ham khel main vaapasi kar sakate hai kyonki australian team main smith or warner hi ran bana rahe the
 Kuldeep bowled amazing in that session
 ham jaanate the ki kuldeep net main shandaar bowling kar rahaa he or hamaare liye anoothaa gendbaaj he
 We all believed in his ability
 australian team kii prashansa kii jaani chahie
 He gave us a tough fight
 tippaniyan Man and the best player of the series, Ravindra Jadeja said, It is good to be a number one Test bowler
 unhone kaha ki jab main batting ke liye gaya to maine sochaa ki apana samay luungaa, lekin tabhi wicket ke peeche se mathew vade ne chhintakashi shuru kar di
 This gave me additional inspiration
 jadeja ne kaha ki captain or coach lagaataar kehete rahe hai ki mujhamen lambey samay tak ballebaaji karne kii kshamta he
 i have developed myself as a player
 kuch samay pehle log mujhe test bowler ke rup main bhi nahin aankate the
 This series is the answer for them
 jaddu ne kaha ki aswin or maine donon chor se ballebaajon par dabaav banaae rakhaa
 a variety of bowling off-spinners and leg-spinners also worked
 ummid he ki bharat ke baahar bhi aisa pradarshan jari rakhuunga
 Australia's captain Steve Smith said that this is one of the best series i have been a part of
 siries main baad ke maichon main shandaar cricket khilne ke liye team india ko puraa shrey diya janaa chahie
 In Dharamshala, Team India's caretaker Ajinkya Rahane said that i enjoyed the captain
 is jeet kaa shrey saare khilaadiyon ko jaataa he
 Our batsmen, bowlers, fielders all performed well
 test ke pehle din hamane lunch ke samay yah faisla kiya tha ki hamen vipakshi team ke ran rokane honge
 If we did that and were able to take a few wickets, then we can return to the game as Smith and Warner were the only runs in the Australian team
 us seshan main kuldeep ne kamaal kii bowling kii
 We knew that Kuldeep is bowling brilliantly in the net and is a unique bowler for us
 ham sabhi ko uski kshamta par vishwaas tha
 The Australian team should be praised
 usne hamen kadaa muqabla diya
 The comments main or siries ke sarvshereshth khilaadi rahe rabindra jadeja ne kaha, number van test bowler banakar acha lag rahaa he
 He said that when i went for batting, i thought i would take my time, but then Matthew Wade started sneaking up from behind the wicket
 isse mujhe atirikt prerana mili
 Jadeja said that the captain and coach have been saying constantly that i have the ability to bat for a long time
 maine khilaadi ke rup main apane ko viksit kiya he
 Some time ago people did not even consider me as a test bowler
 unke liye yah siries jawaab he
 Jaddu said that Ashwin and i kept the pressure on the batsmen from both ends
 of spinner or leg spinner kii vividhta bhari gendbaaji ne bhi kaam kiya
 It is expected that i will continue such a demonstration outside India as well
 australia ke captain steve smith ne kaha ki yah aisi sarvshereshth siries main se ek he jiskaa main hissaa rahaa
 Team India should be given full credit for playing superb cricket in subsequent matches in the series

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne mangalvaar ko rajdhani dilli main kendriya soochna ayog kii nai imaarat kaa udghaatan kiya

 The PM also said that it was decided in 1992 to set up Dr
 Ambedkar International Center in Delhi
 lekin 23 saal tak kuch nahin hua
 After which the foundation was laid and inaugurated in our government
 is dauraan unhone ye bhi kaha ki jab vyavasthaaon main paardarshita aati he, logon ke prati jimmedaari badhati he, uttardaayitv kaa bhav hota he to sarkaron ke kaam karne kaa tarika or yojanaon kaa asar donon hi badal jate hai
 November 2 is Shah Rukh Khan's birthday and where are his fans all over the world going to sit silently on this occasion
 samachar channel se lekar akhbaar, website or radio kisi ke liye bhi is lokapriy sitare ke janmdin ko nazar andaaz karnaa mushkil he
 It is not new to see a crowd of fans outside Shahrukh's house and thank Khan for shaking his hand
 in sabake bich mumkin he ki is superstar se judi khabaren baakiyon ke saath saath shimla kii sadako par taxi chalaane vaale punjab singh ke kaanon main bhi pade
 The things that Punjab Singh would lose by listening to that in which the Shahrukh Khan once used to be an important part
 punjab kii maane to rajnish or lekh tandon apane nae serial ‘dil dariyaa’ ke liye ek nae chehre kii talash main the or yaheen par unki mulaakaat shahrukh khan se bhi hui thi
 Punjab remembers Shah Rukh saying 'zee Zaan Farmeyeon' and calling him for an audition the next day after talking to director Lekh Tandon Khan, after which a typical journey of this common boy from Delhi started
 haalanki punjab ko apane 'shahrukh ji' kii kamyaabi par fakr bhi he or is baat kii khushi bhi ki kahin na kahin ve is superstar ke safar kaa hissaa bhi hai
 In Punjab Singh, you may see the hero of the movie 'billu', whose stories of knowing a superstar is a pass time for someone traveling from Shimla to Kalka ji, and just a story for someone
 punjab singh ek taraf apane man ko samajha chukaa he ki shahrukh use kabaka bhul chuke honge lekin kahin naa kahin apane man ke kisi kone main use shahrukh se dobaaraa milane kii ummid bhi he
 The comments ho saktaa he kabhi shimla main chhuttiyaan bitaane ke dauraan aapaki mulaakaat bhi punjab singh se ho jaae or apane chahete hero kii wo baaten aapako maaloom chalem jo shaayad ab shahrukh khan ke zahan main bhi nahin bachi hon
 Shahrukh is everywhere, sometimes he appears on TV, sometimes on the pages of newspapers and sometimes in the discussions going on at the tea shop
 shahrukh jinhen dekhakar kabhi punjab ko apni kismat par gussa aata he to kabhi unki kamyaabi dekhakar haunsala miltaa he
 Punjab like Shah Rukh has become a permanent expression of Singh's life
 (punjab singh se baatcheet par aadhaarit) You may also meet Punjab Singh while on vacation in Shimla and you will know the things of your favorite hero, which may not even be left in Shahrukh Khan's mind
 har taraf shahrukh hai kabhi tivi par dikhte hai to kabhi akhabaaron ke pannon par or kabhi chaay kii dukaan par chalane vaali charchaaon main unka zikr ho jaataa he
 Shah Rukh gets angry on seeing his fate and sometimes gets encouragement after seeing his success
 shahrukh jaise punjab singh ke jivan kaa sthaayee bhav ban gaye hai
 (based on a conversation with Punjab Singh) (punjab singh se baatcheet par aadhaarit) Smriti Mandhana achieved a major feat as she landed for the toss at the Barsapara Stadium in Guwahati on Monday
 mahila ho yaa purush, vah tii-20 international main sabase kam umr kii bhartiya captain ban gayi
 Mandhana took over the captaincy of Team India at the age of 22, 229 days in T20 International
 sabase kam umr ke purush captain kii baat karen, to suresh raina 23 saal 197 din kii umr main tii-20 international main team india ke captain (2010 main) bane the

 It is a very exciting time, because we have such a young team
 hamen yah dekhne ke liye chah se aath maheene intjaar karnaa hoga ki sabhi khilaadi kaisaa pradarshan karte hai

 Baba Nigamananda died on Monday but could not see the goal he was fighting for was successful
 nainital hoicourt ne 26 may ko faisla diya tha ki ganga ke kareeb ke ilaake main stone krashan supreme court ke nirdeshon kaa ulanghan he lekin nigamanand yah dekh nahin sake
 By this time, he had gone into a coma
 idhar, nigamanand kii maut ke mudde par bijepi kaa kahana he ki wo hycourt ke aadesh ke khilaaf andolan kar rahe the
 BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said that the steps taken by the government to save Ganga were abolished by the High Court
 rajya sarkaar ne unhen sabase achche aspataal main bhartee karaayaa tha
 But the Congress is not ready to accept any of the arguments of the BJP
 congress netaa janardan dvivedi ke mutabik or kisi ko nigamanand ke anshan kii jaankaree ho na ho lekin uttarakhand sarkaar ko to is bare main maaloom tha phir samay par kadam kyon nahin uthaaya gaya
 Here, Union Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh called Nigamananda a slap for the state and central government
 ramesh ne kaha ki rajya sarkaar ne jimmedaari kaa parichay nahin diya
 He said that he had written a letter to the state government on this issue and the Uttarakhand government did not take any action and Baba Nigamananda later died
 jasusi racket kaa khulaasa hone ke baad is maamle main sabase ahm kadi mana ja rahaa jodhpur nivasee shoeb dilli police or khufia agenciyon kii giraft main aa gaya he
 Several teams of Delhi Police were desperately searching for Shoaib
 jiske baad dilli se jodhpur aa rahe shoeb ko police ne medta road railway stesan se giraftaar kar liya
 Shoaib, a Jatiya Bas resident, used to get girls passports in Jodhpur as well as search for girls for use in Hihni Trap
 darasal shoeb aisi ladakiyon kii talash main rahata tha jo pakistan janaa chaahati thi lekin kisi vajah se unhen pakistan kaa vija nahin mil paata tha
 During the passport-visa work, Shoaib came in contact with Mahmud Akhtar, the official of the Pakistani embassy
 is maamle main giraft main aae nagaur ke moulana ramajaan ko sabase pehle shoeb ne apane jaal main fansaaya tha
 Maulana had also associated Subhash Jangid with him due to the lure of money
 darasal shoeb sepuchhatachhamen police ko pataa chal paaegaa ki usne ab tak kitne logon ko mahmud akhtar se milwaaya hai
 Let's say that Shoaib went to Delhi two days ago to meet Mahmud Akhtar
 mahmud se mulaakaat nahin hone ke kaaran vah aaj subah dilli se waapas jodhpur laut rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, officers of Delhi Police and Intelligence Agency arrested him
 gauratlab he ki shoeb ramajaan or subhash ke 25 taarikh ko dilli aayaa tha
 Shoaib did not go to the zoo and stayed at Shanti Kunj Hotel in Delhi
 jab shoeb ko apane saathiyon kii giraftaar kii jaankaree mili to shoeb hotel se bhaag khadaa hua
 During the arrest, police found a tablet and some important documents from Shoaib
 saath hi police ko uske paas se pakistan hai kamishan main entry kaa ek visitor card bhi mila he
 According to the police, Shoaib used to give important information related to the army and BSF deployed on the Rajasthan and Gujarat borders to Ramadan and Subhash
 jiske baad yah jaankaree mahmud akhtar tak pahunchaai jaati thi
 On Shoaib's arrest, Delhi Joint CP Ravindra Yadav said that preliminary investigation has revealed that some of Shoaib's relatives also live in Pakistan
 shoeb abhi tak 6 baar pakistan ja chukaa he
 a tablet and some important documents have been recovered from Shoaib during the arrest
 giraftaar ke dauraan shoeb ne tablet todane kii bhi koshish kii
 Currently, an attempt is being made to recover the information contained in the tablet
 joint seepi rabindra yadav ke mutabik, police poochtacha main shoeb kai chaunkaane vaale khulaase kar saktaa he
 In Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party has put all its strength in the campaign
 party ke sanyojak or dilli ke purv mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal jahaan rozaana shaam ko jansabha kar rahe hai or saath hi chanda jutaney ke liye lunch or dinar ke kaarykram bhi saath-saath jari rakhe hai
 But how far Arvind Kejriwal will be able to campaign
 isliye party ke duusare netaa bhi jansabha karke prachaar kii kaman sanbhale hue hai
 Apart from Arvind Kejriwal, former education minister Manish Sisodia, MP Bhagwant Mann, Delhi convenor Ashutosh senior leaders Sanjay Singh and Yogendra are also engaged in public meeting
 arvind kejariwal ke alaava party main is vakt sabase zyada bheed bhagwant maan ko sunne ke liye jute rahi he
 In the Deoli Assembly of South Delhi, Bhagwant Mann said that this contest is not Arvind Kejriwal vs Narendra Modi because Modi is the PM and he came from Delhi to become CM, but who is this contest versus Arvind Kejriwal? Because the bjp's CM candidate is not known, he is a team without a captain
 aam aadmi party ke duusare sabase bade netaa manish sisodiya jo khud purvi dilli kii patpadganj seat se chunaav lard rahe hai unhone bhi janakapuri vidhansabha main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki bijepi ke paas mukhyamantri ke liye na cheharaa he, na vijan
 Aam Aadmi Party is looking satisfied with the campaign so far and it feels that it has come around BJP in vote share at this time
 aapako bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko 46 fisadi se zyaada vot pade the jabaki aam aadmi party ko kareeb 33 fisadi
 So far, my assessment of the Aam Aadmi Party by walking on the ground is that the Aam Aadmi Party is very strong in the lower and lower middle class while very weak in the middle and upper middle class
 haalanki pichley kuch dinon main is segment main aam aadmi party ko kuch kamyaabi mili he, lekin ab bhi is segment kaa bada hissaa bijepi kii taraf dikh rahaa he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has tried to instill confidence in the young voters, despite some success, the big issue is tilted towards the BJP
 sikh or muslim votaron main aam aadmi party majboot sthiti main dikhti he
 Surprisingly, the Aam Aadmi Party seems to be moving ahead strongly in the countryside, let us tell you here that the Aam Aadmi Party lost very badly in the last assembly elections in the countryside itself
 lekin yahaan dhyaan rakhana zaruri he ki ye disambar ke aakhri kii sthiti he mere nijee akalan main
 Right now, the atmosphere can change a lot, after elections are announced, candidates are announced
 or sabase badi baat asli maahaul tab pataa chalegaa jab bijepi ke liye khud piem narendra modi raily karne ke liye maidan main utrenge
 It has to be seen how much the Congress will climb in these elections
 kyonki aap or congress kaa votbank ek hi mana jaataa he isliye mana ja rahaa he ki jitna congress chadhegi utana hi bijepi chadh jaaegi or nuksaan aam aadmi party ko ho saktaa he
 In such a situation, AAP leaders are also saying in their meetings that the fight is only between BJP and AAP, do not waste votes by voting for Congress
 sarkari lekhapareekshak kaig kaa kahana he ki karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi sanghathan (ipiefo) ke paas vastav main koi adhishesh dhan nahin he or sanghathan jise atirikt dhan bataa rahaa he vah raashi use anshadharakon ke khate main abhi daalani he
 The CAG says that the organization is offering an interest rate of nine and a half percent for the shareholders, terming the same outstanding amount of Rs 1,731 crore as 'secret treasury'
 ipiefo 2005-06 se hi apane anshadharakon ko 8
 Was paying interest at the rate of 5 percent
 lekin usne 1,731
 Rate 9 for 2010-11 citing surplus of Rs 57 crore
 5 pratishat kar diya
 On the other hand, finance ministry sources say that the additional amount in the interest suspension accounts (ISA) of EPFO has been collected because the organization has till March 2010
 72 karod anshadharakon ke khaaton ko adhyatan hi nahin kiya he
 EPFO has about 10 crore accounts

 The payment was recommended to the Revenue Department, which also oversees disaster management along with the police department, according to the Indian Express news
 aadesh main kaha gaya he ki helicopter form ne 13 lakh rupee maange the, lekin molbhav karke sauda main 8 lakh rupee main hua tha
 Leader of the opposition party Ramesh Chennithala said Vijayan's actions are like stealing money from a beggar's bowl
 unhone kaha ki ye bahut durbhagyapurna he ki aapadaa prabandhan kaa paisa mukhyamantri ke helicopter bill ke bhugtan ke liye diawart kiya gaya
 Later, the Chief Minister's Office issued an order asking them to cancel the order of payment

 Dhoni praised both of them
 unhone kaha, aswin ne acha pradarshan kiya or mauris ne unka badhiya saath diya

 Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni praised his bowlers for stopping the Royals for 159 runs, but he was disappointed with his batsmen's performance
 dhoni ne kaha, main samajhataa hum ki gendbaajon ne shandaar bhoomika nibhaai, kyonki lag rahaa tha ki ve isse bada score banaaenge
 Our batsmen did not meet expectations
 iske alaava do ballebaajon ke ran out hone se pareshaani bad gai
 In the last moments, Ravichandran Ashwin scored 46 and Chris Maurice scored 26 not out, but he was able to reduce the margin of defeat
 dhoni ne in donon kii prashansa kii
 He said, Ashwin performed well and Maurice supported him well
 pehle kuch overon main ballebaajon ne acchhee ballebaaji kii lekin duusari team paristhitiyon se acchhee tarah waakif thi or main jaanata tha ki unke gendbaaj hamen mauka nahin denge

 maine keval basics par dhyaan diya
 Ajinkya Rahane, who scored a half-century in a third consecutive match, equaled Michael Klinger's record for South Australia, saying the Royals had the advantage of having a good understanding of the wicket
 rahane ne kaha, ham wicket kii acchhee samaj rakhte hai
 We wanted to dominate after taking the shine off the ball
 yah hamaare liye bahut mahatvapurn match tha
 i only want to focus on positive things, but when the wickets were falling, i wanted to stick to one end

 Former Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan, who attended the World Economic Forum summit in Davos, lashed out at the bureaucracy in the country, saying that the biggest reason for the failure of economic reforms lies in bureaucracy
 india today se exclusive baatcheet main rajan ne kaha ki sudhaaron kii disha ko nirdhaarit karte samay naukarshah ek aisa paksh jod detaa he jisase sabhi sudhaar dhare ke dhare rah jate hai
 Rajan made this comment in response to a question on the privatization of public sector banks
 rajan ne kaha ki yah behad jaruri he ki sarkari bainkon main sarkari kii dakhlandaji ko roka jaae
 At the same time, instead of giving the command of the bank to a bureaucrat, there is a need to hand it to the bank in the hands of the appropriate person
 rajan ne kaha ki sarkaar ko yah saaf taur par samajhane kii jarurat he ki sahi vyakti na ki naukarshah ko bank chalaane ke liye swatantra karne kaa koi vikalp nahin he
 It is not the job of the government to tell the banks what it should do
 sarkaar ke aarthik aankadon par kam hua bharosa, swatantra sanstha kare akalan: rajanhaalanki rigerv bank ke apane kaarykaal ke dauraan naukarshahon se mulaakaat ke apane anubhav ke aadhaar par rajan ne kaha ki unka saamana kai kism ke naukarshahon se hua
 While he was brought up by many excellent officers, he was also exposed to many such officers, whose type Rajan considers a problem in the direction of reform
 khasbaat he ki rajan ne kaha ki maujuuda modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan bharat main vikendrikaran kaa ulta dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 According to Rajan, bureaucrats are playing the role of central ministers in the Modi government
 jabaki adarsh sthiti he ki mantriyon ko netritv karte hue naukarshahon ko nirdesh dene kaa kaam karnaa chahie
 Therefore, according to Rajan, the Modi government has placed bureaucrat in the center of power instead of Union ministers
 saajha nahin kar saktaa rahul gandhi se hui privet baatcheet: raghuram rajanrajan ne kaha ki bharat ko ek aise naukarshahi dhaanche kii jarurat he chizon ko aage badhaane vaali ho na kii baadha paidaa karne vaali
 On the government's perspective on the problem of bank npas, Rajan said that at present the government works to stop the loan installment of the borrowing companies after the NPA is identified
 vahiin sibiai, sivisi, idi jaisi naukarshahi sansthaaen aisi companiyon ke ubharne ke sabhi raaston ko band kar detii hai
 Rajan said that he believes that closing the loan installment after the NPA is identified is a wrong process and it will only spoil the business environment of the country

 Significantly, the High Court had sought information from Baba's lawyer today about Baba, but the lawyer told the court that Baba does not want to appear in the court
 baba ke vakil ne court se yah bhi kaha ki vah court main baba kaa nahin balki sirf ashram kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahe hai
 At the same time, the counsel for the petitioner told the court that the girls were forced to write letters against their relatives

 What kind of spiritual class is this being given? ek yaa 2 maamalon main ladkiyaan parijanon ke khilaaf shikaayat kar sakati hai, sabhi ladkiyaan aisa kaise kar sakati hai?vishvavidhyalay par chhapemari ke dauraan maujuud raheen dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati jaihind ne jab court ko bataaya ki chhapemari ke dauraan unhone dekha ki sirf kam umr kii ladakiyon ko hi baba ke saamne sarender karnaa hota he, purushon ko nahin
 On this, the court said that for the first time we are seeing that only young girls are being held in cages and they are being treated like gopis
 or yahaan par sirf ladakiyon ko rakhaa ja rahaa he, purushon ko nahin, ham kis yug main ji rahe hai?swati ne bataaya ki child welfare kamity ne guuruuvaar ko chhapemari ke dauraan vishvavidhyalay se 41 naaballig bacchiyon ko mukt karaayaa

 Or rather it is a serious lapse in women's safety
 ghatana kal kii he
 Deepshikha Singh Sham 7, working in a research firm
 45 minute par noida se vaishali jane ke liye ola share book kiya
 After a while when Ola called the drawer, he told that he was picking up another ride
 kaaphi der intjaar karne ke baad phir se kol karne par driver ne kaha ki wo kisi or ko pick kar rahaa he
 After a long time, the cab driver's call came and he said that he was coming to the location
 unhone ap par cab detel check kiya to car kii detel usase alag thi
 The message contained information about the whitego cab, while they had the i20 car
 iske alaava us car kaa number plate yalo nahin tha
 The background of the number plate of any commercial vehicle, bus and taxi is black and has yellow text on it
 yani wo cab thi hi nahin balki personal car thi
 He said that there were three boys in the cab and a driver who did not look like a driver
 jab unhone driver se poocha ki jo cab unhone book kii thi wo kahaan he to uskaa jawaab tha ki us cab kaa accident ho gaya he iske badale duusari cab bheji gai he
 However, he canceled the cab and complained to Ola
 iske baad ola ne jawaab dete hue us driver ko suspend karne kii baat kahi he or yah bhi kaha he ki wo is maamle kii jaanch karenge
 After this incident, he booked a second personal Ola cab and his driver told him that after a cab accident either the cab is canceled or the new cab information is messaged
 driver ke mutabik shaam saat baje ke baad share cab book na hi kii jaae to behatar he
 The consequences of such a lapse can be severe, because usually people do not pay so much attention
 khaas kar yah dilli-ensiaar main mahila suraksha par bhi bade sawaal khadey karata he
 After this incident, two important questions arise which we have sought from Ola
 pehla, agar ola share cab kaa accident ho jaataa he waisi sthiti main kya book karne vaale yujar ko bina nai cab kii jaankaree die cab bheji jaati he?doosraa, kya ola kii cab bina yalo number plate ke dilli-ensiaar main chalaai ja sakati he?

 Hind Samyuk Publications is going to publish a story-collection, 'magic Girl'
 iske lekhak hai kishor choudhary
 The book is going to release on all online stores from 23 February 2015
 philhal kitaab kii pre-booking chaalu he
 a story from the same story collection 'gulzan, Dekho Parinde!' Given below
 
 
 gulzaan, dekho parinde!---kishor choudharyhaveli ke band darvaaze se charr kii awaz ai
 The occupants of the doors had forgotten that their work is not to sit in captivity but to open and close
 darvaaze se pehle halki roshni kii patali phaak jhaanki or uske baad ek kamasin cheharaa dikhaai diya
 Two innocent eyes
 bayen kandhaa aahista se choukhat or darvaaze ke palle ko chhue bina tirachha hokar baahar kii ore aa gaya
 During this outing, the eyes first turned closer and then farther away
 dopaher ke do bajnaa chaahate the
 The pendulum clock in the upper room played the hours at regular intervals
 jab vah ghadi ai thi to achaanak bajane vaala ghanta sabakaa dhyaan khinchataa tha
 a few months later, the clock, the time and the people living in that house got mixed up
 ghadi zahan main is tarah shaamil hui jaise jeb main chizein lagaataar rakhi rahen to unka vahaan hona mahasoos nahin hota
 Gulzan taught her the flower lesson
 badan ko billi kaa lacheelaapan diya
 Freshly placed on the eagle's wings
 uski haveli ke paas ek tekri thi
 There was a broken lonely tower on the hill
 gulzaan ne haveli or tekri par kadi minar ke bich kii zamin ko katkar duuri ko chota kar liya
 That long piece of land fell into a small clipping of love
 nahin khulanaa, o maalik nahin khulanaa
 Keep everyone's afternoon sleep safe
 tekri par hawa ne apana dupatta dur tak failaa rakhaa tha
 The air was slowly filling his dupatta with some new creations
 hawa jab ek nayi salwat banaati to ek puraani salwat mit jaati
 Gulzan standing within the scarf of the wind closed his eyes blindly and caught any edge of the wind
 use tah karti
 The wind used to stop
 gulzaan kii aankhon ne phir se khoj kii
 Saw the way far
 halki dhalaan thi, maidan main jaakar kho jaati thi
 The ground visible from among some stones was the way
 udhar kuch na tha
 If the eye falls, it would get lost going somewhere in the middle of gray gray color
 jaise kanche kho jate the
 They would have been lying around there, but in the deception of colors, they would hide themselves in such a way that they are not seen
 uski nigahen intazaar main is tarah tezi se se gum rahi thim jaise bachapan kii koi tazaa or choti yaad
 In which the sand was danced on one of its legs by wearing the appearance of a mermaid
 dhoop ke bich naachata hua ret kaa saaya, aas-paas kii halki chizon ko hawa main uthaae hue, baari chizon ke kaan main phunk martha hua; uda karo, tan se na sahi, man se uda karo
 Such shadows used to come suddenly, as if a spirit passed through the sky
 ruh ne kiya ho ret kaa snaan
 Many times small shadows, such as the birth of new born young souls
 aise chote vartualon ke bich daytan gulzaan kii saans tham jaati thi
 The boy riding a bicycle would have been passing down the slope
 gulzaan upar tekri par suuni padi minar ke bhagnavshesh kii ek diwaar par baithi hui sochati ruh ban jaye
 Cover the eagle's wings and shadow the boy's bicycle
 apane pankhons kii parchhaayi se chaanv bunakar cycle ke saath-saath chale
 Thinking the boy she would see his hands
 uske haathon ke najuk bhure royen khadey ho rahe hote
 Like raw springs bursting from the ground
 vah phir neeche dekhati tab tak cycle par savaar nadaan ladkaa kho chukaa hota
 The brown cries of Gulzan became pink again and lurked within his hands
 hawa ne jo dupatta banaaya he, uskaa rang kaisaa he?us ladke kaa naam dibang tha
 He would take a full round of slope and come upwards
 dibang thak jaataa
 It does not climb
 vah aahista se aankh muundakar dekhati
 Yes, he is coming
 thakaa hua
 Bent
 kai baar rukkar usee ko dekhtaa hua
 He would come from one side only
 us taraf jidhar gulzaan hoti
 Incense dibang fills color
 pasinaa ugaati
 The wind twisted its delicate finger on this new color of sunlight
 uskaa pasinaa sukhaati
 Gulzan would have stopped breathing
 jaise aakiri ghadi ai
 Life became successful
 dibang uske paas baitha hua
 Someone has sprinkled rose water on his forehead
 anek boonden lalaat par chamakati huin
 The drops, consisting of other drops, rolled on the cheeks near the eyebrows
 gulzaan duniya kii sabase choti machhlee ban jaati
 She immediately jumped and entered a small droplet
 vahaan se vah phisalati hui bahati
 Kisses the black color of the eyebrows, tickles the cheeks
 aakhir dibang apana pasinaa ponchta
 Gulzan, who remained a small fish, would come in his palm
 vah apni anguliyon se chhitak detaa nanhee boonden
 Gulzan would rise from the grass and become a girl again with a small fish
 vah hansane lagati
 Dibang watches
 kisalie hans rahi he
 She would laugh again
 use acha lagata ki dibang ko maaloom na chal sakaa ki vah thodi der pehle kya thi
 They would live in sunshine and wind
 suukh rahe dariiton ke tale chaanv nahin hoti
 Gulzan says- “today you stay here with me, do not move
 aaj main pataa lagaaoongi ki vah cycle savaar ladkaa tum hi ho yaa koi or he
 Do any other boys come here through the valley? "dibang would say-" No one else comes
 or kisi ko tum dikhti ho?”“acha, main nahin dikhti magar tum dhalaan ke neeche bade kaale pathar kii oot se aakar aage buudhe darakht vaale mode par kahan kho jate ho?”“tumhaare paas aane ko kho jaataa hoon
 The ruins of the tower would have been heard
 kai dinon se parinde gaayab
 Both of them did not see the birds for how long
 dibang ke aate hi hawa chup ho jaati
 Gulzan forgets to read the colors of the air and hold the edge and fold it
 hawa un donon se ruuthakar tuuti minar ke aangan main dubak jaati
 The wind sat silently, writing lightly on the ground in the shade
 ek miltaa he to duja kho jaataa he
 What should i do in the morning, in this instrument, i would be singing the song Hazarnam Ek Tera Ya Mujhkoguljan
 dibang khoyaa hua sun rahaa hota
 Wet colors on the paper of the mind used to create a picture
 hawa is geet se mugdh ho jaati
 She would leave Ritana and sit outside the temple to Dibang and Gulzan
 vah dekhati ki ladke ke man par rangon ne aakaar liya he
 The wind gently fanned those colors
 sookhen rang jaldi se
 Quickly this boy should be filled with colors
 rang isamen atakheliyaan karen
 Sprinkle colors with this rang uden mere saath
 May i become a chooner of Gulzan
 in donon ko dhank lun
 The air fills a deep breath
 o ladakiyo, tum jab bhi pasand karti ho, kaise itnaa pasand karti ho!hawa is tehre drishy ko tod dena chaahati
 She blows the kurta from the waist of the singing girl and tickles it as grass
 gulajan kii awaz kii girah main ek hansee kaa chhinta padataa
 Dibang would smile
 vah gulzaan kii anguliyaan apni hatheli main rakhata
 a few rose petals in a brown smooth palm
 lajja se bhigi hui
 Lazy
 is kampan main gaanaa kuch tukdon main bantkar hawa main kho jaataa
 The wind would freeze by putting that song in a bugchi
 ladke ke kandhe ke paas koi saaya aata
 The smell of that shadow started spreading without air
 ladkaa ankhen moond letaa
 a deep heat descended near the neck
 paanvon kii pindliyon main kasamasaahat jaagane lagati
 Lips soaked in wet lips
 tadap or tadap
 Suddenly they both looked at each other's face amidst breathless breath in their arms
 vismay se bhari hui ankhen
 Both of them would hold each other's face and close their eyes again
 do but biabaan main
 The ruins of the broken temple lay under the shade tekri ke upar
 Away from the mansion
 aag, pani, mitti, kuch bhi nahin
 The girl came home and walked on the terrace
 galiyon main koi padchaap sunai padati
 Love, love, love
 ek anchhui nai pakija gandh
 From the ink of past flying from letters looking through books
 kapadon main bhare hue biabaan se
 From a large stone lying near a broken wall
 badan kii chhuan, siharan, dar, or sanson ke aalodan segh
 The window frame was sitting silently
 man kii asankhya khidkiyaan pratiksha se bhari padi huin
 Dibang, Dibang, o Dibang
 aao, in khidakiyon se nahin; sachmuch kii khidki se aao
 Come riding on this swing
 dekho, man ek samandar hua
 The heaviness is increasing
 ye thahar ek dabish he
 The breath is disappearing in this Dabish
 ise tod daalo dibang
 At all times, the heart is desperate, beats uncontrollable
 tum kam ho
 Be less everywhere
 har milan main kam ho
 You are not there, you are so few
 chaiyn ke dariiton kii shaakhon se ude hue sukun ke parindon kaa koi nishaan nahin
 a hook spread across the distant sky
 kahin kisi khaalipan main gum hoti hui
 Does not bump anywhere
 khaali aasmaan or be-awaz hook
 Night would have passed subah ke baad upar ke kamare kii ghadi kaa ghanta bajataa
 Exactly the hour the girl was waiting for
 ladki usee tekri kii taraf chal detii
 Shortly after reaching Tekri, Dibang saw him coming
 vaise hi haanfata magar muskuraataa hua
 Dibang used to sit near him
 hawa kaa karishma shuru hone se pehle gulzaan puuchhati- “kal raat tumne kya kiya?”vah jawaab detaa- “maine tumko yaad kiya
 What did you do
 ”“main, kuch nahin kiya bas so gai
 Saying this, Gulzan would ask him- "you will hear one thing
" ?”vah kahata he- “haan sunuunga
 "" But after listening to that you have to answer a question
 ye jawaab mere liye zaruri hoga
 The boy agreed
 “agar jawaab nahin diya to tumko paap lagegaa
 "" I'll answer
 ”“main ye baat jivan main kisi se ek hi baar kahoongi
 You have to give a definite answer, otherwise my point will have to be buried with me
 ”dibang pyaar se uske haath ko tham letaa
 He nodded twice and nodded
 gulzaan use baat bataati
 There was a boy from far away settlement
 vah rose ghar se bhaag jaataa tha
 One day when he reached home, Dibang's elder brother asked- "why, why so sad
" bol to
 Where was robbed
 kidar chot lagi?”ladkaa kahata- “main isliye udhaas hoon ki vah takiye par aansuon se ibaaratein kyon likhti he
 Why do his tears flow out of his voice? "holding the boy's throat, his elder brother pulls the collar with both hands -" Where do you go nowadays
 kya kumhaaron ke shmashaan gaya tha?” ladkaa muskuraataa
 Saffron used to dissolve in her laughter
 ladke ke collar fanda banakar uskaa galaa kasate jate
 Brother asks- "lyrics promised someone there?" Did you hear a voice and yes, filled you? " The knot grew out of the collar knot and the boy's eyes widened
 ek badi haanf hui
 He pushed hard and they both fell apart
 “vah kuch rose pehle dikhi thi
 If you look at the ledge above the old stern turn, everyone sees it
 maine use dekha to usne upar bula liya
 He pointed with a hand, come from there
 jis taraf ishaara kiya usee taraf aasaan chadhaai thi
 When i went there, the wind pushed me up
 ”ladke kaa bhai tezi se bhaaga
 He closed the door of the room
 sidhiyon par badahavaas utarate hue sidhaa mandir vaale aale tak pahunchaa, ghutanon ke bal baith gaya
 His hands were shivering
 maan or baba daude hue aae
 The boy's sister-in-law also came
 mandir vaale aale ke aage ladke kaa bhai uske peeche teen log
 Suddenly a terrible twist occurred in the body of the boy's brother and he fell on the courtyard
 uske paanv se lekar sir tak tadap bhari lehren daudane lageen
 He pointed with a hand upwards
 maan turant upar kii ore bhaagi
 When she laid her hand on the lock of the door, it was ice cold
 maan ne daravaaza kholaa
 The boy was sitting in a corner
 uske chehre par halki hansee ai
 Mother turned and looked down at the courtyard
 ladke kaa bhai shant ho gaya tha
 He was looking at the mother with closed eyes
 maan ne apane munh ko pallu se dhankaa
 Mother left the door open and came down
 ladke kaa bhai sahamkar ghutanon ke bal baith gaya
 He placed his hands on the knees
 vah diwaar kaa puraa sahaara liye hue tha
 The boy had a mild scratch on his throat
 usne tarjani se aangan par kuch likhaa
 Slept
 agali dopaher ladkaa hawa kii tarah ghar se gaayab
 Nobody could see him coming out of the house
 vah adrishy tha
 It was useless to follow him
 mile bhar raftaar se chalane ke baad us ghati ke shuru hote hi uski chaal maddham ho gai
 He was swimming on the road, as if a speck flowed in the lounge
 usne ghati se upar tekri kii taraf nahin dekha
 He reached the old court and then turned to the shadowy part of the hill
 usne gahari saans lee
 The breath that was missing since last night
 kitaab ke lekhak kishor choudhary kaa sankshipt parichaykoi awaz uske qareeb se guzari
 Like there was a rustle
 use gaharaa sukun aane laga
 He touched a gust of wind
 vah boj se azaad hone laga
 There was lightness all around him
 uski aankhon kii palkon par rakhe baari phahe udne lage
 Putting lime started falling on his face
 tekri par tuuti suuni minar ke paas vaale bade pathar par ladki chupchaap baithi rahi
 Seeing him sit like this, the wind simmered
 khaamoshi ke ghaney jangal main syah saae
 Boys, oh boys
 vah lautakar ghar aayaa
 Brother found at the door itself
 “kahan gaye the?” ladke kii hansee jhadane lagi, jaise lohe ke phool gir rahe hon
 The sound of falling iron spread throughout the house
 bhai chup khadaa rahaa or ladkaa ghar main chalaa gaya
 a big bird came out of the house screaming in a hoarse voice
 shaam aalu ke kheton se hoti hui ghar ke darvaaze ai
 Light alcoholic evening
 maan or bhabhi rasoi ke aage muskuraae
 Baba was sitting a short distance away
 ladke kaa bhai vahaan na tha
 The boy was lying on a bench
 uske paas kitaaben rakhi thim
 All the books had red colored paper shells
 udhar us ladki ne basi dopaher ko badan se ragadkar utaara
 Those afternoon peels were soaked by the humidity of the night
 ve vahiin pade rahe
 The girl hanging down from the bed kept thinking what she wanted from the boy
 ek hawa bajati
 a stone humming tuuti deevaaron se koi jhaank aati
 The eagle in the empty vessel of the mind
 gunagunaahat kii chamak
 Peep awe ladke kii soch ke saath ye sab chijen zindaa ho jaatin
 As if the lost life has returned
 jab aisa nahin hota tab vah ladki chat par faili raat kii syah chadar par chor kadamon se chalati
 He feels like black flowers are spread
 ladki ne apane haath ko aangan se chat kii taraf kiya
 He raised both hands and said- "come, come close to me
 mujhe uthaa lo yahan se
 This is not life ye ek shaap he
 This is the wear of the soul's pain
 aao ladke
 you boy
 o mere priy ladke
 Something happened to the boy sleeping in the house
 use laga ki koi musiibat bad rahi he
 He is just a short distance away
 vah bistar se uthaa
 He opened the door neeche angan main dekha
 Everything stable
 raat ke sammohan main qaid chizein
 Missed the way to the hilltop
 usne minar kii tuuti hui diwaar ko sochaa
 He heard the sound of the wind
 usne ladki ko yaad kiya
 In the morning the boy sat on the same bench in the courtyard and read the book
 iske baad usne khaanaa khaaya or apane kamare main aa gaya
 Before noon, when he came to the door to go out of his room, he found that the door was locked from outside
 usne hatthi ko pakadakar khinchaa magar vah na khulaa
 The boy gave a voice
 maan ko pukaara
 No response has been received
 baba ko pukaara, koi jawaab na aayaa
 He gave a voice to his brother, he could not even answer
 ladke ke paanvon par ansakhya makode chadhane lage
 He started pulling the inner arms with both hands
 daravaaza majbootee se band tha
 He called
 behisaab pukaara
 The boy's voice rang out far from home
 darvaaze kii kundi hilti thi magar tuutati nahin
 The boy started running inside the room
 usne khidki ke paas jaakar awaz lagaai
 The door kept moving for two hours
 akhir ghar khamosh ho gaya
 It was late afternoon
 bhai ne aahista se daravaaza kholaa
 There was no movement from inside
 bhai ke peeche baba khadey the
 She was also a mother
 bhai ne apane haath main liye hue sarson ke beej darvaaze ke aage failaae
 Sprinkled water on both sides with a hand made of water
 kaanpate qadamon se bheetar gaya
 The boy was sleeping on the bed
 bhai ne awaz di- “utho
 "he got up with surprise
 usne kaha- “haan bhaiya
 "how long have you been sleeping?" "don't know
 shaayad abhi soya
 "come, come on down
 ”ve sab neeche chale aaye
 There was a third man there
 us aadmi ne poocha- “pahari kii tekri par gaye the?”ladke ko yaad aane laga ki aaj vah kamare main band ho gaya tha
 He started getting depressed
 us aadmi ne kaha- “kya tum tuuti minar ke paas bade pathar par baithe the
 Did you hear any song in the air kisi solah saal kii ladki jaisi awaz main
 Did you notice that the grass straws keep flying round and round with the wind? "the boy said-" No
 ”us aadmi ne lambii raahat kii saans lee
 Lines of concern began to fade on everyone's faces
 us tisare aadmi ne tezi se kaha- “apane haath dikhaao
 The boy put his hands forward
 vah aadmi hatheliyon ko dekhakar aaraam kii mudra main aa gaya
 He left the boy's hands and there was nothing in those hands
 ek bhi laal resha nahin
 The third man woke up, murmured a few, and left with happy steps
 uske jate hi ghar main hawa kii saany-saany shuru ho gai
 The wind was coming from all sides
 basti main zaraa oonchaai par based hue is makaan ke alaava sab makaanon ko hawa bhed rahi thi
 Only the wind was blowing and the rest was silent
 us raat ladke kaa bhai uske kamare main aayaa
 He said that i have to tell you something
 bhai uske paas baith gaya- “asal main ham dar gaye the
 We thought something had happened to you
 vah jo minar kii tekri he vahaan koi saaya he
 There goes something to those who go there
 ab tak jo bhi gaya, use hawa ne chuaa
 Listen to the song in the air
 usne hawa kaa naach dekha
 The wind itself pulls people up there
 ”apane bhai kii baat sunate hue ladkaa diwaar kaa sahaara liye chup baitha rahaa
 The girl who was also imprisoned in the mansion that afternoon
 usne darwaazon ko awaz nahin di
 He did not grab and grab the weapons
 vah chup rahi
 Unlike the boy who was locked up for a day, the girl was kept locked for several days
 iske baad ek dopaher us ladke or ladki ko kisi ne ghati se dekha
 Both of them were on the same pitch together
 jab log unako khojane aae tab ve yahan nahin mili
 They both had disappeared
 phir kabhi kisi ko nahin mili
 Gulzan finished his talk
 dibang soch main gum tha
 Gulzan reminded him that now you have to answer
 dibang ne kaha- “pucho, kya sawaal he?”gulzaan ne poocha- “bataao ve donon kahan gaye
 Dibang felt that the air suddenly stopped after this question
 khaamoshi gahari hoti ja rahi he
 a peep from the broken wall of the tower
 vahaan koi sarsaraaya
 Everything is in deep silence but it seems, everyone is speaking
 pathar, ghaas, ret, hawa, sookhe darakht, har koi usko kuch kahana chaah rahe hon
 Dibang said- “that boy became this tower and the girl became wind
 ”gulzaan ne furti se dibang ko banhon main bhar liya
 She began to cry
 “tum kaise mere man ko pard lete ho
 Tell me where to read the learned mind? " Both of them were lying on a large stone near the broken tower in each other's arms
 unke man bhiige hue the
 They had kissed each other
 dibang ne gulzaan se kaha- “apni ankhen kholo or dekho
 "gulzan said-" Oh am

 Former IIT Kanpur professor Gurudas Agarwal aka Swami Gyan Swaroop Sanand had only one concern - how the Ganga's avidity and cleanliness remained intact
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan ganga ko 'maa' kahkar pukaarane vaale pradhanmantri narendra modi or ganga ko svachh karne kaa vaada karne vaali unki sarkaar ke liye sanand kii maang alahada bhi nahin thi
 But neither the Prime Minister listened to Sanand nor the Central or State Government of the BJP
 or, aakhirkaar ganga ke liye anshan par baithe sanand kaa 11 aktubar ko nidhan ho gaya
 In fact, 86-year-old Sanand wrote four demands to Prime Minister Modi on February 24 this year
 ye maangen thim—ganga ke liye prastaavit adhinium draft 2012 par sansad main charchaa karakar paas karana, uttarakhand main nadiyon par ban rahi or prastaavit jal vidyut yojanaon ko nirast karnaa, ganga mahasabha ke draft adhinium ke anusaar van kataan, khanan or khadaan par purna roak tathaa ganga bhakt parishad kaa gathan karnaa
 20 people should be nominated by the Prime Minister in the council and they should come on the banks of the Ganges and take a pledge
 lekin pradhanmantri yaa sarkaar kii ore se unhen koi jawaab nahin mila
 Frustrated with the attitude of the Prime Minister and his office, Sanand started his fast on 22 June at the Matri Sadan Ashram near Haridwar
 unhone isaki bhi jaankaree patr likhakar pradhanmantri ko dene kii baat kahi thi
 But no one took care of them
 aakhirkaar, 112 din ke aamaran anshan ke baad unka nidhan ho gaya
 This has exposed the attitude of the government
 uttarakhand kranti dal (eukedy) ke netaa kaashi singh airi kehete hai, ''swami sanand kii maangon se sahmati yaa asahmati ho sakati he par jis tarah se pradhanmantri ne unki andekhi kar unhen marane ko chhod diya, vah bahut peedaadaayak he
 That too the silence of the Narendra Modi who has recently won the Champion of Earth Award
 isse award par bhi sawaal khadaa hota he
 Professor Agrawal had dedicated his life to the Ganges after initiation of renunciation
 saal 2012 main unhone ganga main nirmaanadhin jal vidyut yojanaon or bade baandhon kaa virodh karte hue 60 din tak anshan kiya tha
 After this, the government had declared Ganga as a national river and a national authority was also formed for it
 unka kahana tha ki bhaajapa ne apane chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan ganga nadi kii safai ke naam par logon kii aasthaa ko bhunaate hue apane liye vot kii apil kii thi, par unke saare daawey or vaade havaahwai ho gaye
 Matri Sadan has released an audio of Union Minister Nitin Gadkari's conversation with Sanand on his mobile phone
 usamen sanand ko kuch der manaane kii koshish karne ke baad kendriya mantri kaa paara chadh gaya tha
 He had disconnected this phone, "okay, do as you wish
" '' gadakari kaa ravaiya behad niraash karne vaala tha
 Apparently, there was no serious effort at the government level to save Sanand's life
 congress kaa aarope he ki sanand kii maut se modi sarkaar kaa ganga prem chhalaava sabit hua he
 Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat visited Haridwar several times during this fast, but he did not think it appropriate even to inquire about Sanand
 vah bhi tab jab mukhyamantri banane se purv party ne ravat ko ganga swatchta abhiyaan kaa sanyojak bana rakhaa tha
 By the way, Rawat says, "the state government had shown full sensitivity to this issue
" lekin tamaam koshishon ke baad bhi unhone anshan todgaye se inkaar kar diya
 As soon as he sacrificed water on 9 October, he was immediately admitted to Rishikesh AIIMS
 ames ke doctoron ne bhi unki jaan bachaane kaa bharsak prayaas kiya
 "but AIIMS, water man Rajendra Singh, who arrived in Rishikesh for his last darshan, said," The government has ignored Swami Sanand's demands, the government will have to bear the penalty
 vahiin ames prashasan ne unke antim darshan kii anumati nahin di
 The government fears that no one should be inspired by their sacrifice
 '' darasal, ames prashasan ne sanand ke antim darshan ko aae logon ko isaki anumati nahin di thi
 When some people, including Rajendra Singh, sat on a dharna in AIIMS, the AIIMS administration had to allow them to visit
 kuch log sanand kii maut ko hatya qaraar de rahe hai
 Maa Ganga Mission has given a one-day sit-in in Haridwar and demanded a CBI inquiry into it
 vahiin matra sadan ke paramadhyaksh swami shivanand saraswati ne sanand kii maut ko sarkaar ke ishaare par kii gai hatya qaraar diya he
 They allege that Haridwar district administration, AIIMS director and Union minister are responsible for the 'murder' of Gadkari Sanand
 matra sadan kii ore se brahmacharee dayanand ne in sabhi ke khilaaf taharir di he
 He says, "when Swami Sanand was brought from the Mother House, his condition was fine
" par 11 aktubar ko unki mrityu ho gai, yah unki hatya kii sajeesh he
 At the same time, the AIIMS director also gave a false statement to the media that Swami Sanand was being pressured not to break the fast
 ''sanand ke nidhan ke baad matra sadan main ek anya sant, haryana ke guhaana main rahane vaale gopaldaas anshan par baith gaye
 He was forcibly admitted to AIIMS, Rishikesh by the district administration late on 13 October
 discharge hone ke baad ve phir anshan par baith gaye hai
 On October 16, 116 days have been completed for the fast of Gopaldas at different places in Uttarakhand
 philhal, sanand kii maut ko lekar vibhinn aaropon ko bhaajapa sarkaar khaarij kar rahi he, lekin is sant kii maut ke daag uske 'swatchta abhiyaan' se dhulane vaale nahin hai
 Swami Sanand made four demands for Ganga from the Prime Minister
 lekin unhen uskaa koi jawaab nahin mila
 Frustrated, Sanand sat on hunger strike and how many sacrifices? The Mother House ashram was established on the banks of the Ganges in 1998 at Jagjitpur in Kankhal police station area near Haridwar
 tab se maano yah ganga ke liye balidaan dene waalon kii sanstha ban gai he
 Even before Swami Sanand, two celibates of this institution have sacrificed themselves
 inamen se nigamanand saraswati kaa balidaan bhi mukhya rup se ganga ke liye tha
 When the saints of the Mother House started a struggle to demand a ban on noise pollution and illegal mining in the Ganges, they came under attack from local residents and then the mining mafia
 kai baar in santon par hamale hue, par unhone ganga kii raksha kaa sangharsh nahin choda
 Swami Gokulanand, along with Nigamananda in Kankhal, started a fast against crushers and mining mafia
 kareeb 78 dinon tak ganga main khanan par roak lagane kii maang ko lekar anshan karte hue nigamanand saraswati kaa 13 june, 2011 ko dehradun sthit jollygrant aspataal main nidhan ho gaya tha
 Then Swami Gokulananda went on a hunger strike, pushing that demand
 varsh 2013 main gokulanand ekantavaas ke liye gaye the, lekin nainital ke baamani main unka shav mila
 He was also accused of poisoning and killing him
 ab sanand kii maut ke baad sant gopaldaas bhi matra sadan main hi anshan par baith gaye hai
 Sovereign Shivanand Saraswati, the head of the Mother House, says, "matrasadan is ready to make any sacrifice for the Ganges
" ''swami nigamanand*** Sometimes life can be at risk even in the grip of thrill
 karnataka ke banergatta biological park(bibipi) main hui ghatana se to yahi sabak miltaa he
 In fact, when the tourists were walking in a luxury SUV car in this park recently, the driver stopped at a lonely place
 phir kya tha, vahiin paas se hi do sher nikalakar gaadi kii taraf lapke
 One lion overtook the car but the other attacked the car from behind with the previous mirror

 In this regard, local officials say that the driver is really at fault
 unhone kaha ki vaise to safari driveron ko sakht nirdesh hai ki ve raste main kahin gaadi nahin roke lekin aisa lagata he ki sailaaniyon ko khush karne ke liye yahaan par driver ne gaadi roak di
 The result was that these lions came near the cart
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki us ghatana kii jaankaree saamne aane ke baad driver ko safari duty se hataa diya gaya he
 However, it is clear from the video that when the car stopped and started running again, the lion moved away
 is ghatana ke chalate koi ghayal nahin hua or na hi kisi ko chot lagi

 74 on Thursday in Himachal Assembly elections
 45 fisadi matdaan hua
 There were 337 candidates in the fray for 68 assembly seats in the state
 in sabhi kii kismat kaa faisla mat petiyon main band ho chukaa he
 The people of Himachal will have to wait 39 days for the new government
 pradesh main congress or bijepi ke bich kaante kaa muqabla mana ja rahaa he
 But there is a history of the last 32 years that the current government in Himachal has not been able to repeat
 himachal agar apane raajnneetik itihaas ko doharaata he, to phir virbhadra singh kii bidaai or prem singh dhumal kii tajposhi honi tay he
 Let us tell you that as many assembly elections have been held in Himachal Pradesh since 1985
 inamen ek baarcongress to ek baar bijepi satta ke singhaasana par kabizui he
 Himachal Legislative Assembly was formed in 1962
 isse pehle himachal punjab kaa hissaa hua karata tha
 Assembly elections have been held in Himachal Pradesh 12 times
 inamen se 8 baar congress, 3 baar bijepi or 1 baar janata party satta ke singhaasana par kabiz hui he
 The first setback for the Congress in Himachal was in 1977, when it was badly defeated by the Janata Party
 1977 main janata party kii sarkaar bani to shanta kumaar himachal ke mukhyamantri bane
 After this, in the 1982 assembly elections, the Janata Party lost to the Congress
 1985 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main congress phir satta par kabiz hui
 But after this, in the 1990 assembly elections, BJP came back to power with a strong majority and Shanta Kumar became the Chief Minister
 par teen saal baad 1993 main jab vidhansabha chunaav hue to bijepi ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa or congress kii satta main vaapasi hui
 Five years later, in the 1998 assembly elections, the Congress faced defeat and BJP returned to power and Prem Kumar Dhumal became the Chief Minister
 iske baad jab 2003 main vidhansabha chunaav hue to bijepi ko congress ne shikast dete hue satta main vaapasi kii
 Similarly, in the 2007 assembly elections, the Congress was ousted from power and the BJP returned
 himachal ne 2012 main phir apane itihaas ko doharaaya or congress kii vaapasi hui or bijepi satta se out ho gai
 If we look at this political tradition, then this time the BJP is assuming its victory confidently
 lekin ye to ab 39 din baat hi pataa chalegaa ki bijepi kii satta main vaapasi hogi yaa phir virbhadra singh karishma kar dikhaaenge

 " a district quota of Rajasthan moved forward very fast
 is jile kii puri arthvyavastha un koching sansthaanon kii vajah se aage badi, jinhone dhire-dhire apni jaden bahut majboot kar lee hai
 But a stigma is being attached to this city, it is believed that Kota is slowly becoming the city of suicide
 pichley dinon yahaan ek ke baad ek 3 students ne aatmahatya kar lee
 After this, India Today visited here and tried to know the ground reality of why some of the students who are preparing for engineering and medical embraces death here? Kota has got the reputation of coaching hub of the country
 lekin aisa raaton-raat nahin hua
 About 2 decades ago this district was known as Industrial Town where small scale industries were running
 yahaan electrical equipment, kapade aadi kii ikaaiyaan kaam kar rahi thim
 Gradually these units have gone backward and the coaching centers have expanded
 kota ko hi safalataa kaa paryaay mana jane laga haiuttar pradesh, madhya pradesh, karnataka, pashchim bengal samet desh ke vibhinn rajyon ke lakhon chaatr yahaan apana lakshya hasil karne ke liye aate hai
 It is observed that some states have different syllabus
 primary or secondary level kii shiksha kii gunvattta main bhi alag-alag rajyon main antar hota he
 Despite the lack of ability, pressure is put on the student to succeed in the competition
 iskaa parinaam galat nikalataa he
 Chandan Kumar, who came from Bihar to prepare for IIT, told India Today, 'I came to Kota to prepare for IIT from Bihar 6 months ago, i lived in Bihar, i have a house in Bihar
 agar mujhe ahsaas hota ki main vahiin se exam clear kar luungaa to yahaan kyon aata? pichhali baar jab maine yah pariksha di thi to parinaam thik nahin aayaa tha, to sochaa ki ek baar or prayaas kiya jaae
 'one and a half lakh students come every year, more than one and a half lakh students come to Kota to prepare for various competitive examinations in Kota, most of them from outside Rajasthan
 inaki jaruratein puri karne ke liye yahaan bazaar develop ho gaye hai
 In Kota, many houses, apartments, complexes, restaurants, food joints have opened, which are running on the strength of students
 isse yahaan par koching kaa ek vaataavaran taiyaar ho gaya he
 Expectations of parents are overwhelming
 Millions of students here prepare for various exams like iits and AIIMS, but there are many of them who do not have the ability to succeed in the competition
 kai baar aisa hota he ki dur rah rahe maa-baap kii apekshaaon kii neeche chaatr dab jate hai
 While away from home, due to some emotional and psychological pressure, they do not think about what they should do at the time of crisis
 atyadhik dabaav or tanaav ko dur karne kaa upaay na jaanane ke kaaran kai yuva aisa kadam uthaa lete hai jisamen unka jivan hi khatm ho jaataa he
 Many students have a base
 Apoorva Arora, who came from UP to prepare for IIT, told India Today that the biggest thing is that the base of education of many students is very weak
 yani kii 10veen or 11veen kii padhai main hi wo pichde hote hai
 They do not have the kind of quality education that is required for iits
 koching class main bahut se chaatr hote hai
 a student who is weak in studies is unable to even question hesitantly
 dhire-dhire vah or pichhadta jaataa he or depressant main chalaa jaataa he
 This year, 15 students committed suicide
 This year more than 15 students gave their lives in Kota
 inamen se kuch chaatr upi bihar ke aise pariwaron se the jinke parents ne lone lekar yaa jameen jaaydaad girvee rakhkar unhen koching ke liye kota bheja tha
 In such a situation, there was sometimes pressure on him
 kai chaatro ne india today ko bataaya ki pratiyogi parikshaon ke liye jis tarah kii taarkikta kii jarurat hoti he us tarah primary or secondary kii kakshaon main bataaya hi nahin jaataa
 This kind of shortage is seen in the education of many states, but when such students come to the quota for preparation, then they face different difficulties
 pehle screening ho, dikkat hone par counsellinghope foundation ke president doctor em
 L
 agarwal kaa kahana he ki jo chaatr kota aakar taiyaari karnaa chaahate hai
 First of all they should be screened to see if they have merit, whether they have any history of depression, whether they are psychologically strong or not
 agar chaatr us field ke liye feet nahin he to uski karier counselling honi chahie, use bataaya janaa chahie ki vah duusari field ke liye yogya he
 Second, clinics that guide children should be opened so that they can be supported from time to time
 dedh se 5 lakh rupee ek chaatr kaa ek varsh kaa kharch aata haiupi, empi se kota aane vaale chaatr yahaan pratiyogi parikshaon kii taiyaari main dedh se 5 lakh rupee tak prati varsh kharch karte hai
 Some students whose status is not so much, whose parents send loans or loans by quota, they also put undue pressure on the students what will happen if they are not successful
 aisa bhi dekha gaya he ki shuruaati daur main agar koi chaatr pratiyogi pariksha main safalataa hasil nahin kar paata to us par or dabaav padane lagata he
 'send reading, do not make the pressure of the result' says Nitin Vijay of Motion Private Education Ltd, that sometimes there is so much pressure on students that it becomes difficult
 'ham parents ko yah samajhane kaa prayaas karte hai ki agar aapane bachche kii padhai par paise kharch kiye hai to uske badale main us par rigelt kaa dabaav mat banaaie'
 There was talk of the Left coming first in this protest against the central government in Parliament, but then the CPM disassociated itself by saying that 'TMC has not only killed the Left activists but Trinamool leader Tapas Paul has given CPM Has also given indecent statement against women activists of isliye left is sanyukt virodh pradarshan kaa hissaa nahin he
 ' congress-tiemasi ke saath aane kii sambhaavnaaon kaa sipiem saansad rutobrato bandhopadhyaay ne mazaaq banaaya

 In the morning he is with the BJP, in the afternoon with the Congress and by the night again with the BJP

 '' iran samet chah vishwa shaktiyon ne ek asaadhaaran kadam uthaate hue apane parmaanu samjhaute ke gopneey dastavej jari kiye hai or jataane kii koshish kii he ki sanvardhit uranium kii seemaa ke bare main tehran jhooth nahin bol rahaa
 Enriched uranium is used to make nuclear weapons
 kuch dastavej 6 janvari, 2016 ke hai, iske kuch hi samay baad samjhauta lagu ho gaya tha
 But these have been made public yesterday and have been put on the website of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is monitoring the nuclear deal
 samjhaute ke mutabik iran keval kam sanvardhit uranium hi rakh saktaa he jiskaa istemaal hathiyaar banane main nahin kiya ja saktaa or isaki bhi seemaa 300 kilogram tak he jo hathiyaar banane ke liye paryaapt nahin he
 The comments jab yah samjhauta hua tab iran ke paas 100 kilogram se zyada kam sanvardhit uranium yukt taral yaa thos kachra tha
 In the documents released yesterday, it has been announced that the less enriched uranium it possesses cannot be recovered so it is not part of the 300 kg limit
 dastavej jari karne kii ek vajah yah he ki aagaamee america prashasan ne notice dekar samjhaute se baahar hone kii ichha jataai he
 Some documents date to January 6, 2016, shortly after the agreement entered into force
 lekin inhen saarvajanik kal hi kiya gaya he or parmaanu samjhaute kii nigaraanee kar rahe international atomic energy agency kii website par inhen daalaa gaya he
 According to the agreement, Iran can only possess less enriched uranium that cannot be used to make weapons and it also has a limit of 300 kg which is not enough to make weapons
 tippaniyan When this agreement was reached, Iran had less than 100 kg of enriched uranium-containing liquid or solid waste
 kal jari dastavejon main ghoshnaa kii gai he uske paas maujuud kam sanvardhit euronium pun: praapt nahin kiya ja saktaa isliye yah 300 kilo kii seemaa kaa hissaa nahin he
 One reason for the release of the document is that the forthcoming US administration has expressed a desire to exit the agreement by giving notice

 Skill is the new weapon
 agar is desh ke naujavaanon ko kaam karne kii dher sari sambhaavnaaen di jaaen or inke liye jaruri hunar sikhaa diya jaae to desh ke noujvaan nayaa bharat khadaa kar sakate hai
 On September 28, 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi indicated in his much talked-about speech in New York's Madison Square in the US that the key to creating a developed India lay hidden in the fists of the young
 darasal, desh kii maujuuda sthiti yah he ki ek taraf to karodon yuvaaon ke paas aisi digriyaan hai, jinaki padhai udyogon main naukari ke laayak nahin he, duusari taraf kam padhe-likhe mistre-kaarigaron kii aisi fouj he jo kaam to kar rahi he, lekin unke paas kaam karne kii peshewar training nahin he
 In developed countries like the US, 90 percent of the workers have professional training related to their work, while in India only 5-6 percent of the workers are skilled from the professional point of view
 aise main “svachh bharat” se lekar “mek in india” tak kai mahatvakankshi abhiyaanon kii kamyaabi is baat main chuphi he ki kya bharat agle 10 saal main kam se kam 15 karod hunarmandon kii fouj taiyaar kar paata he yaa nahin
 It is not that this question is being raised in the country for the first time
 rajeev gandhi ke pradhanmantri rahete jab shiksha mantralay ko maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay main badla gaya tha to uskaa mul makasad peshewar shiksha ko badhaava dena hi tha
 Similarly, the Manmohan Singh government brought the National Skill Development Policy under the same objective in 2009, but did not meet the target of making 5 crore people skilled by 2012
 desh main is samay bhi 12,500 se adhik itii chal rahi hai, jinka mukhya kaam plumber, fitre, asi or tivi electrician jaise technitian taiyaar karnaa he
 The new skill development ministry of the Modi government is also an attempt to implement these old schemes with a new tone
 karodon haathon ko hunaranational skill deveopment korporation (enesdisi) ke chairman dilip chinoy kehete hai, “itii jaisi sansthaaen apni bhoomika par khara utarane main naakaam rahi hai
 In such a situation, there is a need for new courses, certificates and institutes that can train the youth in a short time according to the industry and the current needs
 ” neshnal skill qualification fremawork (enesannuef) ke tahat bane 1,000 se adhik certificate course main theory kii tulana main prectical par zyada jor hoga
 It will be a special belief that these should not only become the standard for India, but also meet the standards of any developed country in the world
 modi jab bhi kisi desh kii yatra par jate hai to vahaan skill deveopment ko lekar kuch samjhaute jarur kar aate hai
 Agreements have been reached in this regard from many countries including major countries like Britain, Germany, Australia, France and America
 nijee or saarvajanik kshetron ke upakramon ko is kaam main jodne main sarkaar sakriy he
 NSDC has joined 17,000 training centers across the country
 yahaan sarkari yojanaon ke tahat kaushal vikaas ke alaava udyogon kii maang ke hisaab se vyavsaayik shiksha di ja rahi he
 Training Centers Network: Regarding the success of this initiative, Ankur Ahuja, Assistant Vice President, ILFS Skills Development Corporation, who is training youth in more than 40 centers across the country, says, "in most cases, admission is done according to the demand of the industries is
 har centre par 4 se 5 trade kii padhai hoti he
 "after taking 3 to 6 months of training and certificate in these institutions, the person is determined to meet the needs of the industry
 ahuja bataate hai ki ilaphes ke centaron main prashikshan le rahe yuvaaon main se 75 fisadi kii sponcership sarkaar karti he, 10 se 12 fisadi kaa kharch korporate soshal risponsibiliti (siesaar) ke tahat saarvajanik tathaa nijee upkram uthaa rahe hai or 8 fisadi apni jeb se kharch kar rahe hai
 Initially these youth were given Rs 7,000
 se 14,000 ru
 Even gets a job
 ilaphes se retail main course karne vaali priti bataati hai, “main or mere 10 saathi abhi-abhi pantalun main intervyuu dekar aae hai
 "someone who knew him and his colleagues had told about the Okhla Center of the institution
 in logon ne 12veen paas kii he
 Through this training, they will do the job and from this job they intend to spend their further studies
 udhar, haryana ke gudgaanv ke indian institute of skill deveopment (iiesdy) main jammu-kashmir ke traal jile ke 23 varshiya bilal ahamed malik siensi kii training kar rahe hai
 Isn't it strange to enroll in a few months vocational course after diploma in engineering and then btech in mechanical? On this question, Malik says, "I got a degree but didn't get the skills
" yahaan padhgaye ke saath hi santhaan ne naukari kaa vaada kiya he
 The government is bearing the cost of studies
 ”darasal malik centre sarkaar kii “udaan” yojana ke tahat training le rahe hai, jisamen paanch saal main jammu-kashmir ke40,000 yuvaaon kohunarmand banaakar unhen rojgaar ke laayak banaaya janaa he
 After CNC training, young automobile companies like Malik will become parts manufacturing technicians
 kam nahin hai chunautiyanpriti or bilal jaise yuva dilli or gudgaanv ke pratishthit training centaron main padhakar naukari paane ke liye aashwast to hai lekin kya sabko naukari mil jaaegi? yah sawaal aasaan nahin he
 The rate of employment of youth coming out of training centers of NSDC is still 58 percent
 chinoy kehete hai, “hamaara makasad naukari dena nahin, yuvaaon ko naukari ke yogya bananaa he
 In many cases boys prefer to work on their own instead of doing jobs
 ” plasement kii dar badhaane ke alaava centre sarkaar ke mantralayon ke bich aapasi talmail bananaa bhi bahut badi chunauti he
 The reason is that in this scheme of skill development, 5 lakh crore rupees in five years
 lagane kaa anumaan he
 At present, more than 20 central government ministries are running their own skill development schemes, while the skill development fund is just Rs 1,500 crore
 hai
 Therefore the schemes of the ministries have to be added
 phir bhi baari kami hogi
 Where will it be managed? This is the big question
 kaushal vikaas rajyamantri (swatantra prabhaar) rajeev pratap rudi kehete hai, “har bade sapane kii shuruyaat chote str par hoti he
 Gradually will be possible with the cooperation of society, industry and government
 ” (dekheh baatcheet) chunauti yah bhi he ki jis tarah itii lambey samay se apni bhoomika dhang se nahin nibhaa pain, vaise main kya guarantee he ki ye nae kaushal vikaas centre kaamyaab honge
 Will these centers with weak economic resources from ITI be able to give better results than ITI? If there are difficulties, Hachinoy says, “NSDC is engaged in solving these questions
 ” viksit deshon se hue sarkari samjhauton kaa makasad vahaan se behatar technology or behatar trainer praapt karnaa he
 If we can assure the industries that the youth equipped with these certificates are of their use, then the industries will invest better in this direction
 jahaan tak prashikshan sansthaanon kii gunvattta kaa sawaal he to iske liye vistrut maanak banaae gaye hai
 Somewhere in government sponsored schemes, as before, money was consumed by showing fake students? Many such cases are under investigation
 chinoy kehete hai, “kai mantralayon ne biomitric hajiri or naukari paane vaale chaatr kii teen maheene kii selary slip kii sharten rakhi hai
 But our endeavor is to create the urge to advance ourselves
 agar jaanch-padtaal main hi lage rahe or shaq kii najar se dekhte rahe to skild india kaa khwab kaise puraa hoga?” Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu is scheduled to present his initiative budget on Thursday
 rail bajet se deshbhar ke yatriyon kii apeksha or aakankshaayen judi hui hai
 This budget is also important that from next year, the Union Government can present the budget of the Ministry of Railways under the general budget
 rail kiraye main kami, nai train, suvidha, suraksha or sabase adhik railway aarakshan ko lekar jaisi kai chunautiyaan rail mantri ke saamne hai, vahiin bhoomi adhigrahan bill par kirakiri ke bich sarkaar ke paas bada mauka logon ko rijhaane kaa bhi he
 However, this railway budget is expected to reduce passenger fares and freight
 samajha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar suraksha or suvidha par jor degi
 While many big announcements, including FDI, can be announced with respect to increasing the network
 in sab ke bich pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa sapana yani bullate train bhi he
 Sapna and reality are on Suresh Prabhu whether he can fulfill the dream of Prime Minister Modi, because the price of bullet train of 9 coaches is 60 thousand crores and 17 Rajdhani Express cost 75 crores
 yani ek bullate train ke bajet main 800 rajdhani express chal sakati hai
 Then who needs a faster speed and if necessary, when will the days of trains moving on existing tracks turn again
 railway trek bhi badi jimmedarimaujuuda vakt main ek bada sawaal trainon ke parichaalan ko lekar bhi he
 The railways of the Indian Railways are well known and the track behind it is a big problem
 railway trek thik karne or nae railway trek ke jariye railway ko vistaar dene ke liye beete tees saal se sarkaron ke paas 20 hajaar karod se lekar 50 hajaar karod rupee kabhi nahin rahe
 The effect of this is that every day 95 lakh people travel in the train without getting a seat
 desh main railway trek ke halaat aise hai ki kareeb 30 hajaar kilometre trek ko sudhaarney kii jarurat he or 40 hajaar kilometre nayaa railway trek beete 10 varshon se elaan tale hi dabaa hua he
 That is, anyone can see the condition of the railways and say that since independence, no one has thought in the direction of connecting the railway infrastructure with the development of the country
 har din sava karod gramin or majdoor yatriis ore ek bada parivartan pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kaal main aayaa he
 Modi has shown the country the dream of bullet train
 to kya desh kaa asal sach yahi he ki desh kaa vikaas ekatarfa or shahari kendrikrut he
 But most of the people traveling on the train are from rural and laborer sections
 inaki taadaad har din sava karod ke kareeb he
 The reason is also that whenever the picture of the Indian Railways emerges in the figures, from top to bottom, there are cheeky passengers and the speed is seen at about 50 to 60 kilometers per hour
 yani sawaal us aam aadmi kaa pehle he, jo jaan hatheli par lekar train main isliye savaar hota he, kyonki koi doosraa chaara nahin he
 In such a situation, the common man is once again eyeing the railway budget, which, even after 67 years, is asking for basic things like berths in trains in time of need, arrival of trains on time, relief from black marketing, clean water and safety
 to kya suresh prabhu guuruuvaar ko pesh hone vaale rail bajet main haashie par pade aam railyatri ke liye koi khaas ghoshnaa karenge yaa unki ankhon main corporate puunji par savaar hokar railway ko modern banane kaa sapana hoga
 Where bullet train, high speed train, wifi in trains, PPP model and FDI will be more talked about to make stations modern
 khaane kii quality or cataringbhartiya railway ne haal hi main ghoshnaa kii ki ab trainon main pizza bhi sarv kiya jayega
 Domino's has been signed to this end
 lekin rail main parosa jane vaala aam yatri kaa khaanaa kaisaa ho, ise lekar sawaal or prayaason ke baavjood vifaltaa kii kahani nai nahin he
 In the days to come, many complaints are heard about eating food, stale food and so on
 to kul milkaar 'prabhu' bharose jis rail par savaar hokar centre sarkaar aam jan se lekar corporate sector tak ko lubhaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 The same Suresh Prabhu is also facing challenges
 baharhaal, intjaar guuruuvaar kaa he jab suresh prabhu rail bajet sadan ke patal par rakhenge
 Ram Singh, the accused of Delhi gang rape and brother of alleged suicidal Ram Singh, today claimed that he was murdered and said that he showed bruises on the body and fingerprints on his neck
 tippaniyan He said the family would take Singh's body to Karauli village in Rajasthan where he would be cremated
 agyaat rahane kii shart par bhai ne kaha, mere bhai kii hatya kii gai
 i saw bruises on the body and fingerprints on the throat
 is bich, singh ke shav kaa yahaan ames main porst mortem kiya gaya
