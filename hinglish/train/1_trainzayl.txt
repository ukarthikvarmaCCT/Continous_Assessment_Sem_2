 aapaki digital jaankaree kitni surakshit he?soshal media or mobile ap se jutaaye aankade chunavi lihaaj se mahatvapurn hai yaa nahin, sie ke fasebuk ke herpher or namo ap par hue khulaase saaf karte hai ki digital form main surakshit koi bhi nijee soochna chaahe vah bahut surakshit aadhaar hi kyon na ho‚Äîuskaa durupyog kiya ja saktaa he
 India's biometric program base of which 1
 1 arab upyogkarta hai, duniya kaa sabase bada database he
 a security researcher in Delhi named Karan Saini claimed on March 23 that he had detected data leaks in the system
 us system ko sarkari company chalaati he or uskaa istemaal aadhaar ke database ke satyaapan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Saini claimed that with the help of this leak, any person can download all the personal information related to any Aadhar card holder
 isamen 12 ankon vaali biomitric vishisht pahchaan sankhya, phone number, jin sevaaon se ve jude hai se lekar unke bank kii sari jaankariyaan tak, sab kuch hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 Saini's revelation came a day after Ajay Bhushan Pandey, the Chief Executive Officer of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), in which he told the Supreme Court that Aadhaar has been so heavily encrypted that even the world's most powerful computer To break one of its keys will also take as much time as this "age of the universe"
 lekin jaisaa ki sibar suraksha visheshgy pawan duggal kehete hai ki yah khatra sirf aadhaar ke central sarwar se paidaa hone tak simit nahin he balki is aankade kaa prayog kar rahi vibhinn nijee agenciyon se iske chori hone kaa khatra upajataa he jaisaa ki saini ne pataa lagaaya
 These companies do not take all the measures that are necessary to protect data
 duggal kehete hai, "aadhaar ab ek anivaary system ho chukaa he jisamen kai nijee santhaan bhi jude hue hai
 "the problem with programs like Aadhaar and Facebook is that their data is massively centralized and that a single dent in the space means that the entire database would be in danger," says Pranesh Prakash, policy director at the Center for Internet and Society
 is
 yah send kahin se lag sakati he, aapke aadhaar card kii photocopy nikaalane se bhi isaki sambhaavna ke daravaaje khul sakate hai
 The argument that UIDAI made to dismiss Saini's point is very bizarre
 company ne tark rakhaa, "ise kuch is tark se samajhen
 Suppose that if the utility company database got breached and this company has the bank account number of the customers, then what does it mean that all the banks have a break in the database? The answer cannot be anything other than "no"
 '' yuidi ke adhikari yahaan is baat ko nahin samaj rahe ki carddharak ne swechha se kabhi bhi is baat kii sahmati nahin di he ki bina uski anumati ke uske bank se judi jaankaree saarvajanik kar di jaae
 The Congress, which started the Aadhaar project, continues to attack the Modi government over issues related to privacy
 congress ke netaa abhishek manu singhvi kehete hai, "niztaa ke vishay par pradhanmantri modi kitne gambhir hai yah tabhi jaahir ho gaya tha jab sarkaar ne supreme court main niztaa ke adhikaar se jude vishay par apane tark rakhe the
 The Attorney General told the court that the Aadhaar figures were completely safe as it was hidden behind a 13-foot-high and five-feet-thick wall
 ''singhvi modi sarkaar ko ek gaiyr-jimmedaar sarkaar qaraar dete hue kehete hai ki agar aapane is sarkaar kii koi khami jagajaahir kar di, to phir sarkaar us khami ko dur karne kii koshish to katai nahin karegi, haa aapke peeche pad jaaegi
 The Central Government may have denied the point of break in Dhar's database but it has given a strong message to Facebook regarding the CA leak
 kendriya kanoon evam ity mantri ravishankar prasad ne fasebuk ke siio mark jukerbarg ko saman karke bharat laane kii dhamkee tak di he
 Within 24 hours of this statement, Zuckerberg said in an interview, "there is a big election in Brazil
 sari duniya main bade chunaav hone vaale hai yaa hote rahete hai or aap vishwaas karen fasebuk par un chunaavon kii akhandta ko bachaae rakhane ke liye jo kuch bhi kiye jane kii jarurat he, use karne ke liye ham katibaddh hai or kar bhi rahe hai
 According to a media report, the market price of Facebook has decreased by eight percent
 24 march ko fasebuk ne akhabaaron main ek panne kaa vigyaapan dekar sie scandle ke liye maafee maangi
 The ad stated: "it was a breach of trust and i am proud that we did not make enough efforts in time
 bhavishya main kabhi aisa na ho, iske liye ham sabhi aavashyak kadam uthaa rahe hai
 In a response sent via email, a Facebook spokesperson told India Today, "we changed the platform in 2014 to reduce access to our data
 usase pehle ke ham un sabhi ap kii padtaal kar rahe hai jinke paas baari sankhya main aankadon tak pahunch hua karti thi or kisi bhi ap main yadi koi sandigdh gatividhi pai gai to ham us ap kaa gahan audit karenge
 Although both our internal and external analyzes are ongoing, we are fully committed to protecting people's information
 hamane bhavishya ke liye bhi kuch kadamon kii ghoshnaa kii he
 This includes taking stringent measures to remove past defaults as well as take safe new steps than ever before so that such situations do not occur again
 '' fasebuk ne yah bhi kaha ki vah un logon ko suchit karegi jinke profile se judi soochna kaa kisi ap ke jariye durupyog hua he
 But in this age of internet, are such assurances sufficient to secure a person's personal digital information where web trackers like Google Analytics can catch every click on the browser? Symantec's Internal Security Concerns Report for 2017 states that India is the fifth weakest country in terms of cyber security breach
 or keval rajnatik taak-jhaank nahin hoti
 There are other forms of data theft that often corporate or hackers do for marketing campaigns or good bargains
 udhaaharan ke liye may 2017 main food delivery ap zomato ke aankadon kii sendhamari kii ghatana ko hi len jab iske 1
 The figures of 7 crore users were being stolen and put on Darknet for sale
 is jaankaree ko phir se apane kabje main lene ke liye company ko haikar ke saath baari molbhav karnaa padaa tha
 Similarly, the hackers took 5 of Uber
 7 karod driveron or rides kaa data hack kar liya
 Uber gave hackers a million dollars to withdraw the data
 anand kehete hai, "sabase zyada chori to hamaare mobile phone ke kol record kii hoti he
 "experts unanimously demand a strict and robust data protection law, which covers both government and non-government data
" duggal kehete hai ki sarkaar ko fasebuk prakaran ko khatre kii ghanti ke rup main dekhnaa chahie or soochna praudyogiki kanoon, 2000 main sanshodhan karke isamen data sangrakshan se judi vyapak dharaaen jodphi chahie
 India can take some lessons from the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which is set to take effect from May 25 for the 28 member states of the European Union (EU)
 jidipiar iyu ke baahar personal data ko bhejne ko bhi niyantrit karata he
 The data that the GDPR regulates includes identity information, IP addresses, cookie data and RFID tags, health and genetic data, racial or ethnic statistics, political ideology and gender orientation
 sie scandle ke pariprekshya main bharat main rajnatik vichaardhaara se jude aankadon kaa sangrakshan bahut praasangik ho jaataa he
 The new law should not only remove these gaps, but should also have measures to prevent inappropriate use of private data by government officials
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne daawa kiya ki pradhanmantri ne ensisi cadats ke aankadon kaa durupyog karte hue un sabhi se 2019 ke chunaav se pehle sampark kii yojana banaai he
 What will be private information also needs to be defined
 visheshgy kehete hai ki aankadon kii suraksha ke liye swytt niamak sanstha bane or iske durupyog yaa sendhamari kii sthiti main sarkaar ko uttaradaayi tehraaya janaa chahie
 68 on cyber security by the government for data protection in 2015-16
 2 karod rupye kharch kiye jabaki america sarkaar ne is avadhi ke liye 28 arab dollar (1
 8 lakh crores) expenses
 jab tak sarkaar hamaare aankadon ko surakshit karne kii disha main kuch thos upaay karti he tab tak har nijee digital upabhokta ko kuch jaruri satarktaayen baratane kii jarurat he

 Shami said, 'from the very beginning in the series, our intention was to bowl according to the strategy and from the line and length
 lekin aapaki ranneeti hameshaa kargar sabit nahin hoti
 Many times bowlers do not have a day and hence line and length also go wrong
 kai baar aap acchhee gendbaaji karte ho lekin aapako wicket nahin milte or aap ran bhi ganvaate ho
 Today (the first day) our focus was on the line and length and i am glad that we were able to do it today
 'shami ne din kii shuruyaat acchhee nahin kii lekin baad main unhone acchhee vaapasi karke 55 ran dekar do wicket chatkaaye
 Apart from him Umesh Yadav also took two wickets while r Ashwin got one wicket
 unhone kaha, 'meraa dhyaan subah line va length par tha
 If a bowler achieves this, then nothing is impossible for him
 maine teji par dhyaan nahin diya kyonki paristhitiyaan anukool nahin thi or pich se madad milane par hi main aisa karata
 In the last moments of the day, Shami went out for a while but then came back and bowled the last over
 unhone fitness sambandhi kisi chintaa kaa khandan kiya or kaha, ‚Äòmeri fitness ko lekar koi masalaa nahin he
 There is some trouble on the field all the time
 is tarah kii koi pareshaani nahin he
 There was a slight strain in my left thigh muscle and i went out to avoid any injury
 maine iske baad vaapasi karke aakhri over kiya
 I'm good now and will bowl tomorrow (the second day)

 "he considered Varun's speeches" a "serious violation of the model code of conduct" and immediately sent notices to Varun and the BJP in this regard
 pehali baar chunavi maidan main utar rahe varun se bhaajapa ne pehle to duuri bana lee or ayog se kaha ki party varun ke bayaan se jaraa bhi ittefaq nahin rakhti or sidi se bhi uskaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Varun's argument was that the alleged speeches were made on 7 and 8 March but the dispute arose ten days later, based on private unofficial tapes, which may have been prepared with a political motive
 varun ke liye paristhitiyaan tab tak mushkil lag rahi thim jab tak ki chunaav ayog ne bhaajapa ko yah salaah nahin di ki vah unhen chunaav main na utaarav or kaha ki, ''bhaajapa yaa anya kisi raajnneetik party dwaara varun ko chunavi maidan main utaarna yaa unki ummidavaari kaa samarthan karnaa varun ke akshamya kaary kaa samarthan samaj jayega

 hindustan yani duniya ke nakshe par aatankwaad ke liye sabase badnaam mulkon main se ek pakistan ke thik bagal main
 But the maneuver that Pakistan has changed just before this tour, overnight the eyes of the whole world have turned towards Pakistan
 pintara, mumbai hamale ke gunahagaar jamaat-ud-daawa samet takreeban darjan bharaatankwaadi sanghathanon par banalgane kaa
 jamaat-ud-dawa is guilty of the death of hundreds of innocents
 hakkaani networamerica or nato fouj kaa kaatilhai
 jamaat-ud-dawa is responsible for the terrorist attack in Mumbai, while the Haqqani network is responsible for the attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul
 pakistan kii sarajameen par punap kar anginat begunaahon kaa khun bahaanevaale in donon hi aatankwaadi sanghathanon par aakhirkaar phulstop lag hi gaya
 That is, under the banner of jamaat-ud-dawa, neither the world's most dreaded terrorist, Hafiz Saeed will be able to set fire against Hindustan nor can the Maulvi Jalaluddin Haqqani under the flag of the Haqqani network make it fidayeen against the US and NATO forces
 
 sawaalon ke ghere main banpakistan main jamaat-ud-daawa or hakkaani network samet takreeban darjan bhar aatankwaadi or vivaadit sanghathanon par bain lagane ke baavjood yahi wo sawaal he, jo har kisi ke jehan main he
 The reason is that Pakistan has never been serious about terrorist organizations that flourish, grow and grow on their own soil
 balki agar ye kahen ki pakistan kii hukumat alag-alag daur main alag-alag tareeke se in sanghathanon ke jariye kursi par bane rahane kii tarkeeb ladaati rahi, to bhi ye galat nahin hoga
 And now this is the reason why the Government of Pakistan has announced to stop these organizations, there is doubt about its intention across the world
 pakistan ne aisa tab kiya he jab duniya kaa sabase taqatvar shaks yani america raashtrapati baraak obama hindustan aanevaale hai
 And when America has asked Pakistan to do so in very harsh manner
 aise main sawaal yahi uthta he ki kya ye vaaki pakistan kii niyat main hui tabdili kaa asar he yaa phir us par bane dabaav kaa asar
 Anyway, after the terrorist attack on the Army School of Peshawar on 16 December, Pakistan denied big differences like Good and Bad Taliban and made big talk of dealing with all the terrorists in the same way
 lekin iske baavjood kaaphi dinon tak ye tamaam sanghathan or inase jude dehshatgard kaayade-kanoonon kii dhajjiyaan udaate rahe
 Pakistan continued firing on the Kashmir border and there were attempts to infiltrate the terrorists
 pakistan se aa rahi khabaron ke mutabik vahaan kii sarkaar ne in donon aatankwaadi sanghathanon ke saath-saath harakat ul jihad islamic, harakat ul mujahidin, falaah-i-insaaniyat foundation, ummah tamir-i-nau, haji khayrulla haji sattaar mani exange, raahat limited, raushan mani exange, al akhtar trust or al raashid trust jaise sanghathanon par bhi roak laga di he
 But to understand the true impact of this decision, the whole world must wait for a few days
 pehle bhi chali he aisi charmerica par 9-11 hamalon ke baad lashkar-e-tayba par pabandi laga di gai thi
 After which Hafiz Saeed had a new move for the first time
 usne lashkar ko ek nayaa naam jamaat-ud-daawa de diya
 After this, he continued his jihadi operations in the whole of Pakistan and surrounding areas by the same name
 phir mumbai hamale ke baad duniyabar kii suraksha agenciyon kii najaron se bachane ke liye hafiz said ne vahi puraani chaal chali
 The jamaat-ud-dawa, or the religious face of Lashkar, has once again changed
 jamaat-ud-daawa ab ban gaya tha taharik-e-hurmat-e-rasul
 The intention of Hafiz Saeed was clear that whenever his terrorist organization is banned, he will continue to change his name and spew jihad poison
 darasal, mumbai hamalon ke baad sanyukt raashtra kii suraksha parishad ne pakistani sanghathan jamaat-ud-daawa par bhi pabandi laga di thi or uske liye is naam se duniya ke kisi kone main kaam karnaa mushkil hone laga tha isiilie hafiz said ne nai chaal chali thi
 Such a move that he had tried many times before with success
 lekin uske iraade ab bhi utane hi khatarnaak the wo ab bhi duniyabar main jehad kaa danka peetna chahta tha
 But now after United Nations, America has also declared jamaat-ud-dawa as terrorist organization
 aage padhein, koun he hafiz said
 
 
 The seeds of hatred that had come from childhood, America and the United Nations have already named Hafiz Saeed in the list of the world's most dangerous terrorists
 itnaa hi nahin uske sir par america ne das million dollar yani kareeb 60 karod kaa inaam bhi rakhaa hua he
 He becomes a respected figure for Pakistan, sometimes Muljim and sometimes non-state actor
 lekin kisi bhi surat main hindustan ko lekar uski badjubaani kam nahin hoti
 Panic has always injured India at his behest
 uske sir par america ne inaam tak rakhaa hua he, lekin kamaal dekhie ki wo pakistan main khuleam ghumta he
 The special thing is that this biggest attacker of Mumbai attack Hafiz Saeed sometimes embraces Yasin Malik, the separatist leader of Kashmir, and sometimes hears Hindustan by instigating Pakistani army
 hindustan ke khilaaf hafiz ke man nafrat kii bol koi aaj nahin badi, balki ye beej uske man main tabhi pad gaya tha, jab donon mulkon kaa bantwaaraa hua
 Many of Saeed's family, who hail from Haryana, were killed in the riots before Partition
 lekin duniya ne hafiz said kaa naam tab pehali baar suna, jab usne 1990 main iesai kii madad se jamaat-ud-daawa ke jhande tale aatankwaadi sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyaba kii buniyaad rakhi
 When Hafiz Saeed's name also came up with Maulana Masood Azhar in the attack on Parliament on 13 December 2001 in India, he got another feat in his cause 
 iske baad 11 july 2006 ko mumbai ke train dhamaake or 26 / 11 ke mumbai hamalon ke peeche bhi said ke dimag kii baat saamne ai, lekin ham uske khilaaf karrwai kii baaten karne ke sivaa or kuch bhi nahin kar sake
 The extent is that despite all the evidence, the Pakistani court acquitted Hafiz Saeed in this case
 unhone is ghatana ke liye jimmedaar logon par sakht karrwai karne kii maang kii
 Vaiko alleged that the central government was trying to impose Sanskrit and Hindi on the state in various ways

 Chidambaram's sonkarti Chidambaramki extended CBI custody till 12 March
 karti 28 farvari se sibiai kii castady main hai
 Karti, through a lawyer in the court hearing, described the entire case as tragic and a means of harassment
 magar shuukravaar ko peshi ke liye unhenptilaayaa house courtlaaye jane ke dauraan samachar agency pitiai dwaara lee gayi tasviren kuch or hi kahani bayaan kar rahi hai
 There was no sadness or wrinkle on Karti's face during the court appearance
 vah tasveeron main mutthi taane dikh rahe hai
 His right hand is seen upward
 vah mutthi baandhe apane haath ko hawa main laharaa rahe hai
 If these pictures are seen as a record then it would be remarkable
 guuruuvaar ko bhi jab unhen patiala house court main peshi ke liye laayaa gaya to unke daaen haath kii mutthi bandhi hui thi jise vah hawa main laharaa rahe the
 On the other hand, a picture of Karthi walking out after meeting with former INX Media directors Peter and Indrani Mukherjee in Mumbai can also be seen
 haalanki soshal media par karti kii vijay vaali mudra yaa kam se kam unke aatmavishvaas ko lekar alag alag raay dekhi gai

 karti ke poj par ek soshal media yujar kaa kahana tha, gambhir aparaadhon ke aaropee bhi aise poj de rahe hai, jaise ve raajnneetik shahid hon
 He looks as if he has won a gold medal in the Olympics
 ek pramukh akhbaar kii website ne to twitor par ai in tippaniyon ko vyang bataate hue lagaaya tha
 In this, a word like 'bribe idol' was also used, commenting on the picture of Karti
 bataa den ki karti chidambaram par aarope he ki unhone airsel-mexis or ienex media ke liye galat tareeke se videshi nivesh pramotion board (fipb)kii manjuuri hasil kii thi
 Both cases belong to 2007

 It is alleged that Karthi took help of her father in this
 isi maamle main sibiai ne ienex media, iske nidesakon peter or indrani mukherjee ke saath karti chidambaram kaa naam bhi joda gaya tha
 Karti is currently in CBI custody in this case
 karti chidambaram ke jitne bhi poj dekhne ko mili unka kya sandesh he? kya yah koi raajnneetik sanket dete hai? yaa kya yah swaabhaavik si tasviren hai? yaa kathin daur se guzarane ke dauraan yah khud par bharosa hone kii baat ko darshata he? kya ham ise jaan sakate hai? ab iske peeche chaahe jo bhi raaj ho use to sirf karti chidambaram hi jaanate honge
 Reacting to Karthi's statement, BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli told India Today, "there are serious allegations against Karthi Chidambaram, which are being investigated by various investigative agencies
" praathmik taur par media ne jo sawaal uthaae hai ve mahatvapurn hai
 Serious allegations of taking bribes, even when his father was finance minister, should be investigated
 karti ke hawa main haath lahraane par kohli kehete hai ki yah nishchit rup se khush rahane kii sthiti to nahin he
 If Karti Chidambaram sees this as a political message or personal achievement, he is very innocent about what the BJP or any other person can comment on
 vahiin karti kii body loguage par congress ke tom veddcan kaa kahana he ki pi
 Both Chidambaram and Karti Chidambaram are full of confidence and are confident that they have acted within the ambit of the law

 Vann also criticized the fans of India

 aapaki team ne bilkul bhi acha pradarshan nahin kiya
 After trailing by 338 runs on the third day of the fifth and final Test, the Indian team collapsed for just 94 runs in the second innings

 England performed brilliantly, Van wrote

 Parliament on Saturday finally agreed to three demands laid by Gandhian Anna Hazare as a condition for an effective Lokpal Bill
 pichley 12 dinon se anshan baithe anna hajaare maangon par sahmati jataate hue sansad ke donon sadanon ne is sambandh main laae gaye prastaav ko saidhantik taur par sweekaar kar liya or use sansad kii sthaayee samiti ke samaksh bhejne kaa aagrah kiya
 Only then paved the way for Anna Hazare to end his fast
 loksabhaa main laae gaye prastaav par aadhe ghante se adhik samay tak chali bahes ke baad sadan ke netaa va kendriya vitt mantri pranab mukherjee ne kaha, "main samajhataa hum ki sadan kii bhaavana yah he ki vah saidhantik taur par rajyon main lokayuktaon kii niyukti, lokapal ke daayre main sabhi sarkari karmchaariyon ko laane or naagarik charter banane par sahamat he
 "mukherjee then urged the Speaker of the Lok Sabha to send the proposal of concurrence made in the spirit of the House to the Standing Committee
 mukherjee ne rajyasabha main bhi kamobesh yahi baaten doharaai or uske baad sabhapati se aagrah kiya ki sadan kii bhaavana ke anuroop bani sahmati ke prastaav ko sthaayee samiti ko bhejein
 Mukherjee then also urged Anna Hazare to break his fast
 iske baad donon sadanon kii kaarywahi somvaar 11 baje tak sthagit kar di gai
 Anna had asked to pass a resolution in the House on the three main points of the Jan Lokpal Bill - appointment of Lokayuktas in states like Lokpal, bringing all government employees under the purview of Lokpal and the Citizen Charter - to break the fast
 subah 11 baje loksabhaa main sadan ke netaa pranab mukherjee ne yah kehete hue ki duniya kaa sabase bada loktantr aaj chauraahey par khadaa he, anna ke teenon pramukh muddon sahit bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ek prabhavi lokapal ke mudde par sadan main sanvaidhanik daayre main rahete hue vyaavhaarik or nishpaksh charchaa karaane kaa prastaav rakhaa
 After this Sushma Swaraj supported the proposal and agreed to Anna Hazare's demands and said, "if the lower level employees are not brought under the purview of Lokpal, then the common citizen will feel cheated
 " iske alaava sushamaa ne lokapal ke daayre main pradhanmantri or kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) ko laane kaa bhi samarthan kiya
 He supported a separate system for transparency in the judiciary
 janata dal-united (jad-you) ke netaa sharad yadav ne teenon pramukh mudde par apana samarthan vyakt kiya
 At the same time, he asked Anna Hazare's colleagues to warn him that he should control his speech
 unhone kaha ki raajnneetigyon kaa majaak udaane par unhen badale kii karrwai kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Congress MP Sandeep Dikshit conditionally supported Anna Hazare's three main demands related to the effective anti-corruption Lokpal Bill
 naagarik charter banane par unhone kaha ki sarkaar ise bhi bhrashtachar virdohi tantra main shaamil karne kii koshish kar rahi thi
 On bringing the lower level employees under the purview of Lokpal, Dixit said that it is very important because the common man joins the government through these employees
 marxvaadi communist party (makapa) netaa basudev acharya ne kaha ki unki party ek 'majboot or prabhavi' lokapal vidheyak chaahati he or yah bhi chaahati he ki karporate jagat ke bhrashtachar ko iske daayre main laayaa jaae
 Acharya said, "corruption is a nexus between the corporate world, politicians and bureaucracy
 pichley rashtramandal khel ke silsile main hamane dekha kis tarah bhrashtachar hua
 This nexus needs to be broken
 " rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ke adhyaksh lalu prasad kaha ki anshan par baithe gandhivadi anna hajaare ko purv police adhikari kiran bedi sahit unke sahyogi gumraah kar rahe hai
 Bedi is eyeing the upcoming general elections
 unhone kaha, "ham sansad kii sarvocchata ko ek inch bhi idhar se udhar karne kii anumati nahin denge
 People who are surrounded by Anna Hazare are misleading them
 kejariwal hamen sikhaa rahe hai
 They should be told that the standing committee is a small parliament
 " kuch aisi hi sthiti rajyasabha main thi
 Here also the discussion started with Mukherjee's speech
 vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne kaha ki saamaajik kaaryakarta anna hajaare ke samarthan main saamne aae logon kii sankhya se spasht sanket miltaa he ki log vartmaan vyavastha se khush nahin hai
 Sitaram Yechury of the CPI (M) said in the Rajya Sabha, "we agree in principle on the three demands put by Annaji
 in maangon ko lokapal vidheyak main shaamil kiya jaae, lekin inhen bhartiya samvidhan ke anusaar lagu kiya jaae
 "he said that the country's federal structure should not be teased

 Chris Gayle and Virat Kohli put on a miraculous performance of Mojes Henriques in a rain-affected match by presenting a good sample of his stormy swagger and deft batting, helping Royal Challengers Bangalore beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by six wickets from Duckworth Lewis Rule in IPL Eight i kept my hopes up
 scorcard dekhenhenrics ne 22 gendon par 57 ran banaae, jisamen paanch chauke or chaar chakke shaamil hai
 Warner played a supporting role with him
 unhone 32 gendon par paanch chaukon or ek chakke kii madad se naabad 52 ran banaae
 The two shared a 103-run stand off just 43 balls for the second wicket, helping the Sunrisers, who decided to bat first, score 135 for three from 11 overs
 toss hone ke turant baad barish aane ke kaaran lagbhag do ghante 40 minute tak khel nahin ho paaya
 After this the number of overs was reduced to 11‚Äì11
 sunrisers kii pari kaa jab aakhri over chal rahaa tha, tabhi barish aane lagi
 The umpires completed the innings despite the displeasure of RCB players
 aaarasibi ko aakhir main chah over main 81 ran kaa lakshya mila
 Gayle gave a stormy start to RCB with 35 runs off just ten balls with four fours and three sixes, while skipper Virat Kohli scored an unbeaten 44 off 19 balls
 aaarasibi ne 5-5 over main chaar wicket par 83 ran banaakar jeet darj kii
 Virat Kohli scored the winning six
 warner ne ise kaich kar diya tha, lekin unka paanv seemaa rekha ko chhu gaya
 Kohli hit three fours and as many sixes
 aaarasibi kii yah 13 match main saatvin jeet he, jisase uske 15 ank ho gayi hai
 The Sunrisers have 14 points from 13 matches
 is tarah se aaarasibi ne keval do over main 41 ran thok diye, jo ipel main pehle do over main sarvaadhik ran kaa nayaa ricard he
 Earlier, RCB had scored 39 runs in 2011 against KKR in Bangalore
 lekin henrics ne aate hi sabase pehle gail ke tufaan ko thanda kiya or phir abi divilliars kaa tufaan uthne se hi pehle tham diya
 Gayle played a shot in the air on a short pitch, but he converted to a catch at deep midwicket
 agali gend par divilliars ne bhi long aan par kaich thama diya
 RCB needed 38 runs in three overs
 kohli ne karn sharma kii gend par mili jeevandaan kaa phayda uthaakar isi over main chakka lagaaya
 He also sent Praveen Kumar for six runs
 is tarah se aaarasibi ko aakhri over main 14 ran banane kii jarurat thi
 Warner showed confidence in Bhuvneshwar Kumar but Kohli hit him continuously for a four and then a six and sunned the Sunrisers' hopes of securing a place in the playoffs
 isse pehle sunrisers ne nirdhaarit samay main hue toss ke samay ballebaaji kaa faisla kar liya tha, lekin uski shuruyaat bahut acchhee nahin rahi or shikhar dhawan (8) jald hi pavilion laut gayi
 He was caught at mid on in an attempt to play a long shot off Weege's ball
 henrics ne leg spinner yajuvendra chaahal par chakka or chaukaa jadkar shuruyaat kii or phir agle over main ashok dinda ko bhi yahi sabak sikhaaya
 Taking advantage of Harshal Patel's first delivery, he scored 21 runs in this over with the help of three fours and a six
 agali baar stark kii gend par unhen jeevandaan mila
 Henriques completed the half-century off just 20 balls, the second-fastest Pachasa this season
 is bich sunrisers kii team keval aath over main saikade tak pahunch gayi thi
 Warner hit Chahal's googly for a huge six off a switch hit, while Henriques also sent the last ball of the over for a skyscraper six
 warner ne iske baad ipel main apana 23waan ardhashatak puraa kiya, lekin vies ne is over main henrics ko wicket ke peeche kaich karvaa diya
 Weise was the most successful bowler of RCB
 unhone do over main 20 ran dekar do wicket liye
 Stark took three overs and took the wicket of Eoin Morgan (11) for 26 runs

 How does the selection for the show happen? What happens during this audition process? Nishant Kaushik, who had auditioned for the show in the year 2012, has shared the truth of the show's audition on Twitter
 unke ye twit thread kaaphi share kiye ja rahe hai
 Today, with the allegations of Nishant, he tried to contact the producers of the show
 haalanki nirmaataaon ne abhi is bare main kuch bhi bolne se manaa kar diya
 Brief, nonchalant thread about my auditioning experience at Indian Idol 2012 and why i think it is a perfect platform to destroy your dreams as opposed to its common perception as a breeding ground for talent
 ‚Äî Nishant Kaushik (@nofreecopies)august 20, 2018nishanth ne apana anubhav saajha karte hue likhaa, "aam dharna he ki yah sho tallent ko badhaava dene ke liye acchhee jagah he
 i think this is the best way to destroy your dreams
 " nishanth ne bataaya ki saal 2012 kii may main mumbai main audishan yojit karaae gaye the jahaan wo sirf masti ke liye pahunch gaye the
 There were about 2 kilometers of long queues

 Those who thought this was the biggest chance of their life

 i rocked up at the venue more out of casual interest
 On joining a queue 2 km long i noticed enthusiasts who had arrived there as though their lives depended on them
 Some with their mothers holding Prasad, other rebels who had braved odds and participated alone
 ‚Äî Nishant Kaushik (@nofreecopies)august 20, 2018nishanth ne bataaya, "vah bhi subah 7 baje se line main lage, lekin tamaam log aise bhi the jo subah 5 baje se hi line main lag gaye the
 Apart from this, there were some who were in the lines all night because they wanted to join the forefront
 haalanki kisi ne bhi unki ankhon par pade parde ko nahin hataaya ki yahaan pehle aao pehle paao jaisaa kuch bhi nahin he
 Despite waiting for hours, its doors opened at 1 pm
 "nishanth ne bataaya, "is lambey vakt main vahaan na to toilet kii koi suvidha thi or na hi khaane-pani ke stall
 "if you had to come out of the line and go looking for it, there was every possibility that you would have lost the place
 "I joined the queue at 7 AM
 There were people who had arrived at 5 AM
 Others who had camped overnight
 False notion that early arrival = early audition
 No one from the crew to dispel such notions
 Gate opens 1 PM
 ‚Äî Nishant Kaushik (@nofreecopies)august 20, 2018nishanth ne likhaa, "khayr, dopaher ke ek baje hamaara intjaar khatm ho gaya? galat! dopaher ek baje hamen kisi jhund kii tarah skool ground ke ek stage kii taraf bhej diya gaya jahaan pichley saal kaa ek vijeta contestant spikar par baj rahe gaanon par hont hilaa rahaa tha
 Nishant said that the performance continued till 5 pm and in the meantime we noticed that a canister of water and a toilet were put in the middle for the crowd of thousands
 "in those long hours of waiting, no accessible toilets or food stalls or drinking water taps
 If you step out in search, you risk losing the queue which you'd then have to rejoin
 Anyway at 1 pm the long wait ended right? Wrong
 - Nishant Kaushik (@nofreecopies) August 20, 2018 He told when he asked the crew if we could go for food or water? So the crew said - you go to your risk, because auditions can start at any time
 haalanki jab audishan kii shuruyaat kaa sahi vakt poocha gaya to is bare main bhi hamen kuch nahin bataaya gaya
 According to Nishant, the auditions did not start till 8 pm and then we were asked to shout in front of each other stage
 hamen cheekhney chillane liye kaha gaya ki "WE LOVE INDIAN idol!"at 1 PM we were herded toward a stage on the school ground where the previous year's winner Shriram was lip syncing to Desi Boyz
 a volunteer amongst us was sought to go and grab Shriram's feet mid-performance and shout "I wanna be Indian Idol!" Reward promised: early audition

 But what is the basis
 kya mahaj isliye ki wo rani thi, uskaa balidaan bada ho gaya
 Is it just because she was a beautiful beauty, her sacrifice was heavy on the rest of the queens, people and castes

 Two women were sitting in the factory at home and making fake opium
 mul singh yah sab opium kii jabardast badi maang ko puraa karne ke liye kar rahaa tha
 Opium in Marwar is now being used as homegrown viagra, or as a sexual enhancer, besides youth, and especially youths are using it vigorously for this purpose

 The Shyam Benegal Committee believes that the board's job should be to give certificates to the film and not to use scissors
 film par kanchi chalaane se behatar he ki use certificate hi alag darje kaa diya jaae
 This will also retain the creativity of the filmmaker and enable the board to do its work
 benegal kamity ne chaar maheene main apni pehali report di he
 The next and last part of the report will be submitted to the government by 20 June
 manamaane dhang se kanchi na chalaae sensor boardereport main kaha gaya he kifilmon ko certificateene ke naam par use manamaane dhang se sensor karne kaa kaam board kaa nahin hona chahie
 The film is released and reaches the theater in its original form, but its certificate will be different and obviously the audience too
 lihaaja shyaam benegal kamity ne kendriya film pramann board ke adhikaar kshetra or kaamkaaj ke taur tareekon par apni report main ye sari baaten vistaar se kahi hai
 In a report submitted to the Minister for Adult Education with a separate certificate of information and broadcasting, Arun Jaitley, the committee has clearly said that the films can be extended one or two more in addition to the existing slots of CU, UA and a certificate
 lekin filmkaar kii rachanaatmakataa par kanchi chalaanaa uchit nahin he
 Adult category films can be given a more strict certificate ie 'adult with Cochin'
 aakhir ham nai sadi main hai
 The committee was formed in January 2016
 The committee, headed by Filmmaker Shyam Benegal, was submitted to the government before the completion of four months
 kamity main benegal ke alaava camel hasan, rakesh omprakash mehara, piyush pandey, gautam ghosh or bhaavana somayya ke alaava soochna prasaaran mantralay ke manonith adhikari bhi shaamil hai
 Referring to the rights of the board in the report, it has been recommended that the board may also refuse to give the certificate if the scene or plot of the film is objectionable
 board ko certificate dene se inkaar kaa haqcinemetography act 1952 kii dhara 5 bi (1) board ko inkaar kaa adhikaar detaa he
 But it will have to be seen that the offensive part of the film will put a strain on the integrity and sovereignty of the country
 film ke drishyon se mitra deshon se rishton par asar padataa ho
 There is danger of law and order problem
 saamaajik shaleenta, maryaada yaa naitikta ke khilaaf drishy yaa kathanak ho
 Or even cross the boundary set for Adult Certificate

 In the second part of its report, the committee will recommend to stop atrocities on animals in alcohol, cigarette scenes and movies

 haryana main abhi tak cabinet gathan nahinjegepi or nirdaleey ko mantri banane par pechharyana main manohar laal khatter kii sarkaar bane hue 17 din guzar gaye hai, lekin mantrimandal kaa gathan abhi tak nahin ho sakaa
 The bjp's ally Jananayak Janata Party, the independents, has a complicated cabinet case between participation, ethnic and regional equations
 jabaki, mukhyamantri manohar laal or dipti siem dushyant chautaala ne nattejey aane ke tisare din hi shapath le lee thi
 After the Chief Minister Manohar Lal's meeting with BJP President and Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday, it was believed that a new Haryana cabinet would be formed on Tuesday
 sutron kii maane to jejepi kii demand or maharashtra main fanse pech ke chalate mantrimandal gathan ke kaarykram ko lataka diya gaya he
 It is believed that now ministers can be sworn in in the next two-three days
 jejepi kii demand se tala mantri mandalaharyana main kul 14 mantri banaae ja sakate hai
 Out of the total 14 ministers of the state, 8 of BJP, 4 of JJP and 2 Independent mlas can be made ministers
 sutron kii maane tobijepi apane sahyogi jejepico sirf 3 mantri pad dena chaahati thi, lekin jejepi aakhir tak 2 cabinet or 2 rajyamantri banane kii maang par adi hui he
 Not only this, the JJP is also eyeing some important departments like Finance, Agriculture and Home in Haryana, but the BJP has not agreed to give Finance and Home
 iske chalate pichley dinon dushyant chautaala ne bijepi adhyaksh amit shah se mulaakaat kii thi
 The cabinet formation of the Manohar government has been postponed due to the presence of various districts, castes and independent mlas trapped in the parts of independent legislators
 jejepi ke saath nirdaleey vidhayak bhi bijepi ko samarthan de rahe hai
 There are 7 independent mlas in Haryana and all are manipulating to become ministers
 lekin bijepi nirdaleey vidhayakon main se kareeb 2 se 3 ko mantri pad dena chaahati he
 Not only this, the BJP of Haryana wants to keep the caste and social equation intact through the cabinet
 haalanki mantrimandal main ho rahi deree par bijepi vidhayakon kaa maananaa he ki grih mantri amit shah maharashtra vivaad ko sulajhane main lage hue the
 That is why cabinet formation is delayed
 jabaki jananaayak janata party ke netaaon kii maane to ayodhya vivaad par nirnay ke maddenjar mantrimandal ke gathan ko sthagit kar diya gaya he
 BJP sources say that the cabinet expansion has been postponed due to the insistence of Jananayak Janata Party

 pahchaan banaai, usee shahar main buudhvaar ko adhivaktagan unka sammaan kar rahe the
 Before coming to the court premises, many people welcomed him by wearing flower garlands along the way
 magar darvesh ko is baat ahsaas bilkul bhi nahin tha ki ye din unki jindagi kaa aakhri din hoga
 After the ceremony, Darvesh was sitting in the chamber of senior advocate Arvind Kumar Mishra
 tabhi edwocket manish sharma vahaan pahunchaa or pistaul nikaalkar darvesh par teen goliyaan daag di
 Before anyone could understand anything, he shot himself one too and it was all over
 darvesh ko ek goli sir main or ek goli seene main lagi thi, wo khun lathpath jameen par gir padi thim
 On being taken to the hospital, the doctors declared him dead

 Manish was shot in the head

 Based on tradition and consensus, Darvesh Singh Yadav was elected chairman for the first six months and Harishankar Singh for the remaining six months
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki vah upi baar council kii pehali mahila chairman thim
 Why did Manish become a murderer? There was an old friendship between accused advocate Manish Sharma and Darvesh Singh Yadav
 isliye logon ke jahan main ye sawaal uthanaa laazmi he ki aakhir manish ne darvesh kaa katl kyon kiya
 And even if murdered, why did he shoot himself? unki puraani dosti ke bich aakhir aisa kya hua ki achaanak manish ko ye khaufnak kadam uthaanaa padaa
 Half an hour earlier, the man was wearing garlands with him at the reception of Darvesh
 tasveeron main darvesh ke saath dikh rahaa tha
 How did he become a murderer in half an hour
 kaise wo apni jaan kaa bhi dushman ban gaya
 All these questions are yet to be answered
 rajasthan kii janajatiyon ke ek prakhyat guru ne ek baar yuva amit shah se kaha tha, ‚Äútumhaari takadir to aisi he ki tum oont kii peeth par baithkar chaloge to bhi tumhen koi kutta kaat legaa
 "the message of this traditional proverb was that no matter how high the Shah is, he will never be able to get away from troubles
 shah ne us guru kii baat ko hanskar taal jarur diya tha, lekin vah uski bhavishyavaanee se mukt nahin ho paa rahe hai
 Many adjectives such as ruthless, crooked, dabang are used for the new BJP president
 haalanki, inamen koi bhi visheshan us chunavi jaadugar ke vyaktitv kaa puri tarah khulaasa nahin karata jo yah maanata he ki vah jeetne ke liye hi bana he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley believes that Shah is the fastest political minded animal of his generation
 lekin shah ko apane samakaksh anya raajnneetikon se jo baat alag karti he, vah he jeetne kii unki ichha
 Shah is always ready to do whatever needs to be done to win
 haal ke aam chunaav ne sabit kiya ki shah chunaav prabandhan ke maamle main shahenshaah hai
 While Modi was continuously holding rallies, Shah would sit for hours with dozens of young activists staring at computer screens, studying the latest reports for each seat and preparing an action plan for each ward
 jab chunavi prabandhan kii baat ai to unhone sabase zyada prayaas un siton ko bachaane par lagaaya jo unke mutabik chunaav ke din kisi or ke paksh main ja sakati hai
 Shah took every possible route to turn the seat in favor of the BJP ‚Äî whether to organize a Modi rally, push forward a pseudo-candidate to divide opposition votes or disgruntle disgruntled leaders of the local dominant castes
 Ho
 disambar 2013 main dilli ke vidhansabha chunaavon main 15 aise nirdaleey ummidavaar rahasyamay tareeke se prakat ho gaye jinka chunaav chinh torch aam aadmi party (aap) ke chunaav chinh jhaadu se bilkul miltaa-julata tha
 These independents with flashlight symbol dashed the prospect of AAP candidates in at least five seats
 amit shah se jab torch vaale ummidavaaron kii maujuudagi par sawaal kiya gaya to unki ankhon main sharaarat bhari chamak kaundh gai
 He said, "it is better not to answer some questions
 ‚Äùuttar pradesh main aam chunaav ke liye prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan yah shah kaa hi vichaar tha ki aise modi vine taiyaar kiye jaaen jo saikadon gaanvon main jaakar bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar kaa sandesh prasaarit karen
 In every village where we went in the India Today Group's Election Express bus, we saw a crowd of villagers gathering around the chariot and listening calmly to the speech of the leader who was promising to lift them out of poverty
 ye aise doordaraj ke gaanv the jahaan duusari partiyon ke kaaryakarta or unke zyaadaatar netaa pahunch bhi nahin paae
 Modi has been fond of Shah ever since he was an RSS pracharak in Gujarat in the 1980s, but the relationship between the two deepened after Shah went to jail on charges of conspiracy in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh encounter case
 sibiai ne shah ko todgaye ke liye har tarah kaa upaay apanaaya, lekin shah ne apane bos ke khilaaf jabaan nahin kholi
 Shah stood by Modi even during such difficult times
 lihaaja, modi un par aankh mundakar bharosa karne lage
 However, Shah is very practical about his relationship with Modi
 unhone kaha, ‚Äúmain kisi kaam ko anjaam de saktaa hum to main sabase acha aadmi hum, lekin yadi koi mujhase behatar mil gaya to modi ji ke liye sabase acha aadmi vahi hoga
 "the day Modi was made the chairman of bjp's election campaign committee, Shah told me at Goa's Marriott Hotel," Our national plan is ready
 ham isi din kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 You will see the speed and scale with which we run Modi's campaign
 ‚Äùshah ko bijepi kaa nayaa adhyaksh banane kii yojana bhi isaki aupchaarik ghoshnaa ke kai hafte pehle taiyaar kar lee gai thi
 Shah's blueprint is also ready for the forthcoming assembly elections in the country
 ve is par jaldi hi amal shuru kar denge

 26 / 11 ke mumbai hamale kaa jimmedaar aatanki hafiz said hindustan ke sabase bade dushmano main se ek he
 He is responsible for the murder of hundreds of innocents
 united neshans kii taraf se uske sir par 10 million yues dollar kaa inaam ghoshit he
 Her stars suddenly fell into disarray earlier this year, when she was suddenly under house arrest by the Pakistani government on 30 January
 paak sarkaar kaa ye kadam tab sachmuch chaunkaane vaala tha, kyonki jo pakistan ab tak haafiz said ke khilaaf anginat subooton kii andekhi karata rahaa akhir usne haafiz said ko achaanak nazarband kyon kar diya tha? to isaki bhi ek kahani thi
 Hands of innocents have their hands dyed with the blood of hundreds of innocents
 wo hameshaa dehshatgardi kii jubaan bolta he
 He has a prize of 10 million US dollars on his head, because he is 'internally Designated Terrorist'
 ab wo keval bharat kaa hi nahin balki duniya ke sabase taqatvar desh kaa bhi mostwonted aatanki he
 Changing Color: In Hafizhafiz Saeed's life, everything was going well till January this year
 wo kabhi begunaahon kaa koon baha kar chup-chaap bill main ja ghusata to kabhi jehad ke naam par kashmir ke algaavvaadiyon ko bhadakaane kii koshish karata
 At times, he would increase his status by calling India and America his enemies and sometimes openly respecting the rulers of his own country
 nizaam badalane par hui thi karrwilekin tabhi tarikh badali
 Nizam changed and with this Hafiz Saeed's fate also changed
 shaayad tabhi, jo haafiz said kal tak apane sir par das million yues dollar kaa inaam lekar bhi pakistan main chutta gum rahaa tha
 He had to be under house arrest overnight
 pehle sarkaar ne most argent ke tag line ke saath us par shikanja kasne kaa farmaan jari kiya or phir agle hi din pakistan kii police lahore main uske thikaane par ja pahunchi wo bhi use nazarband karne ke liye
 But it is said that the thief should go by theft but do not go through the sin
 to jate-jate bhi haafiz said ek baar phir zehar ugal kar gaya
 Pakistan's drama: Amidst reports of Hafiz being detained, his statements and above all Pakistan's old nature
 duniya main kam hi aise log honge, jinhen vaaki haafiz said ke khilaaf hui ye karrwai, us vakt bhi asardaar karrwai lagi hogi
 Rather, according to experts, this exercise to detain him was nothing but Pakistani drama
 varanaa haafiz said ke khilaaf akele hindustan ne hi pakistan ko itane saboot saunpe hue he ki agar ek baar bhi pakistan ne unhen sanjidagi se liya hota, to haafiz kii baaki kii umr salaakhon ke peeche hi nikal jaati
 Hafiz's detention only shows off
 From the very first day, US President Donald Trump has been saying that he should be strict against terrorism

 But now, after ten months, his release has proved that the action was air only

 manoj tiwari ko purvaanchaliyon se maafi maangani chahie
 These 10 questions from AAP on BJP: 1
 notebandi kii maar se dilli ke bazaar, mandiyaan sab suuni ho gayi hai, vyapaar chaupat kar diya, kya is khushi main bijepi laddu baant rahi he?2
 Weddings, treatment has stopped, now the arrangement of bread is getting difficult, is BJP distributing laddus in this happiness? 3
 notebandi ke naam par hue is 8 lakh karod ke ghotaale main modi ji ke amir dost or amir ho gaye, bijepi ke dalal dost aish kar rahe hai, kya is khushi main bijepi laddu baant rahi he?4
 After demonetisation, only new and old notes were found in large quantity with the people associated with BJP, is the BJP distributing laddus in this happiness? 5
 notebandi ke naam par hue is 8 lakh karod ke ghotaale main bijepi ne apana kaala dhan safed kar liya, kya is khushi main bijepi laddu baant rahi he?6
 All the claims of Modi ji related to demonetisation, such as terrorists funding, fake notes, black money, corruption will all stop now, now proved to be false, is BJP distributing laddus in this happiness? 7
 manoj tiwari se ye ummid nahin thi ki ve purvanchal vaasiyon ke saath aisa bhadda mazaaq karenge, purvanchal ke mehanatakash logon kaa rojgaar chhot rahaa he, unka palaayan ho rahaa he, or manoj tiwari unki is buree haalat par unka saath dene kii bajaay laddu baant rahe hai, kyon?8
 De La Rue Company, which was accused of supporting the terrorists of Pakistan, gave them the work of printing notes in their Mysore press, is the BJP distributing laddus in this joy? 9
 dilli kaa kisaan, mazdoor, vyapaaree, aadhati ab bijepi ke khilaaf he jo APMC ke chunaav parinaamon se spasht ho jaataa he, kya is khushi main bijepi laddu baant rahi he?10

 Singh said that with the hard work of Rahul Gandhi in the state and trying to understand the situation by going to each village, this time the Congress government will come under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi in Uttar Pradesh and the development of the state for 22 years

 At the same time, the haste of BJP state president Dharamlal Kaushikki to go to Rajya Sabha in Chhattisgarh has put BJP in trouble
 bijepi kheme main abhi yah tay nahin ho paaya he ki aakhir koun rajyasabha pratyaashee hoga
 Despite this, BJP state president Dharamlal Kaushik reached the assembly and bought the nomination papers for himself

 The claims of the country's former Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian have been strongly denied by the Economic Advisory Council to Prime Minister (EAC-PM)
 arvind subramanyam ne haal hi main daawa kiya tha ki 2011-12 or 2016-17 ke dauraan desh kii jidipi ko badha-chadhaakar pesh kiya gaya
 He submitted a paper claiming that India's growth rate between 2011 and 2017 was 4
 5 pratishat rahi thi na ki 7 pratishat jiskaa daawa maujuuda narendra modi sarkaar karti aa rahi he
 The Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council has said that the letter presented by Arvind Subramanian does not meet the academic standards and criteria required for policy research
 bataa den ki america kii harvard uniwarsity ne subramanyan kaa ek shodh patr prakashit kiya he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki 2011-12 se lekar 2016-17 ke bich desh kii jidipi galat tareeke se nikaali gai or ise lagbhag 2
 5 percent increase was shown
 unhone kaha ki jin aankadon ke aadhaar par jidipi kii gananaa hui wo jhuthe or bhraamak the
 Trusting private agency, not government, though EAC-PM said Arvind Subramanian blindly relied on data provided by the private firm Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), while he was released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) Do not trust the data left
 aarthik salaahkaar parishad ne kaha he ki arvind subramanyan kaa vishleshan seva or krishi kshetra ke aankadon ko nazarandaaj kar detaa he or aisa karnaa ek tatasth arthshaastri ke liye uchit nahin he
 The Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council has stated that the methodology of estimating India's GDP is compatible with global standards and being a large and responsible economy of the world, India follows all standards
 aarthik salaahkaar parishad ke is patr ko taiyaar karne main desh ke jane-maane arthshaastri bibek debaroy, rathin roy, surajeet bhalla, charan singh or arvind vimaani shaamil hai
 Let us tell you that Arvind Subramanian was working as the country's Chief Economic Advisor in the Finance Ministry since October 2014
 unki seva chaar saalon tak thi
 Ignoring the service and agriculture sector, the paper noted that Arvind Subramanian hastily concluded India's complex economic system
 patr main kaha gaya he ki unhone apane shodh main 17 suchakaankon kaa sahaara liya, lekin sarvice sector or agriculture sector ko nazarandaaj kiya
 Explain that the service sector contributes 60 per cent of the country's GDP and the agriculture sector contributes 18 per cent
 in arthshaastriyon ne kaha ki subramanyan ne jin 17 suchakaankon ke aadhaar par jidipi ke aankadon par shaq jataayaa he wo sidhe CMIE se liye gaye hai jo ki ek nijee agency he or ye agency alag-alag sroton se aankade ikattha karti he
 The EAC-PM has stated that he has led a team of expert economists and statisticians while working as Chief Economic Advisor in the Finance Ministry and knows how complex the calculation of GDP is
 in arthshaastriyon ne kaha ki aankade ikattha karne kii maujuuda prakriya ko chunauti dena na sirf mantralay main kaam kar rahe arthshaastriyon or offisron ke liye hatotsahit karne vaala he balki ye anuchit bhi he

 He never considered Burhan Wani a terrorist
 unhone yahaan tak kah diya tha ki agar unhen pataa hota ki encounter vaali jagah par burhan vaani he to ve use ek mauka jarur deteen

 haal hi main unhone yahaan tak kah diya tha ki agar modi sarkaar kaa kashmir ke prati yahi ravaiya rahaa to ghati main koi tirangaa kaa kandhaa dene vaala bhi nahin bachegaa
 Mahabubah Mufti started politics in the heart of Kashmiris by making the house of terrorists mournful, in the era of 1989 when terrorism was at the peak of Kashmir

 In such a difficult environment, Mehbooba made her place among the general public of Kashmir

 isi kaa nateeja tha ki kuch hi dinon ke bheetar party se kai bade netaaon ne duuri bana lee
 The biggest challenge before Mehbooba Mufti this time is to save the party from breakdown, as well as gear up again for the upcoming assembly elections

 patil ke khilaaf do saal pehle sibiai ne bank of maharashtra or union bank of india se dhokhadhadi karne or aapraadhik sajeesh karne kii shikaayat darj kii thi
 According to the complaint, both the banks received about 49 from this fraud

 5 karod rupee kii rakam donon bainkon main baant di gai
 The end result was that the bank waived 51 crore rupees out of its total 76 crore rupees and just 12 in the loan of Rs 20 crore

 Significantly, due to this loan of the bank, a liquor factory was set up in Sakol near Latur
 is maamle main 23, march 2014 ko banking security orfrod selki taraf se exiaar darj karai gai thi
 After the investigation of the case, CBI accused Patil of criminal conspiracy and cheating

 com / fltsat9hun‚Äî Sony TV (@sonytv)november 8, 2019 The central government defended the decision to make Aadhaar card mandatory for PAN cards, in the Supreme Court on Tuesday said that this has been done to curb the use of fake PAN cards in the country
 atarni general mukul rohtagi ne nyaayamurti e ke sikari or nyaayamurti ashok bhushan kii peeth se kaha ki pan kaa kaarykram sandigdh hone laga tha kyonki yah farji bhi ho saktaa tha jabaki aadhaar puri tarah surakshit or majboot vyavastha he
 Whereas Aadhaar is a completely secure and robust system through which a person's identity could not be fake
 rohtagi ne kaha ki aadhaar kii vajah se sarkaar ne garibon ke laabh kii yojanaon or pension yojanaon ke liye 50 hajaar karod rupye se adhik kii bachat kii he
 He said that about two lakh PAN cards have been canceled while 113
 7 karod aadhaar card jari kiye gayi hai
 But the government has not yet found any duplicate case
 atarni general ne kaha ki aadhaar card aatanki gatividhiyon ke liye dhan muhaiyaa karaane kii samasya or kaale dhan ke chalan par roak lagane kaa ek prabhavi tarika he
 The debate in this matter will continue on Wednesday

 This section has been implemented in the new Budget and Finance Act, 2017

 According to the new provision, it has been made mandatory to give Aadhaar details along with the application for allotment of PAN number from July 1 this year
 yachikakartaon kii ore se varisht adhivaktaa shyaam dewan ne isse pehle daleel di thi ki dhara 139ee asanvaidhanik he or yah aadhaar kanoon ke saath sidhe takaraav main he
 He also argued that there is no question of forcing a person to give consent for Aadhaar and this is an issue which changes the relationship of democratic India with its citizens

 Last month, around 100 Indian students fell into the limelight when they came to understand that the university they have filled the form is actually fake
 duutavas kii salaah main kaha gaya he ki aise chaatr khaastaur par teen baton kaa khyaal rakhen
 The first thing is that the university is running from a campus or it has only administrative room and it is running the website itself
 duusari baat yah he ki kya uske paas teacher hai yaa nahin
 The third thing is what the university will teach and whether it runs the class through rules
 isamen aage kaha gaya he ki aisi uniwarsity main pravesh le chuke chaatro ke paas bhale hi niyamit student vija ho, par ve kanoonee pachade main funs sakate hai or unhen america se berang lautnaa pad saktaa he
 It is worth mentioning that some time ago, the US administration arrested 129 Indian students by exposing the 'pay to stay' visa racket

 Indian Embassy spokesman Shambhu Haqqi said in this consultation, "to ensure that Indian students do not get caught in a" trap ", it is advisable to check thoroughly before admission to American universities

 The Modi government re-passed this bill on Tuesday, creating a situation of fresh confrontation with the UPA government

 During this time only the ruling party mlas were present in the House and the opposition Congress mlas boycotted the House in case of deaths due to poisonous liquor

 If we incorporate the President's suggestions, the Gujkoka Bill will become another Indian Penal Code which is not a good thing for Gujarat, which has land and sea borders with neighboring Pakistan

 So we formulated a law to fight organized crime

 Therefore, we have added the word 'terrorism' to the Bill and defined 'terrorist activities'

 The congress-jd (S) coalition government in Karnataka has been in the news ever since it was formed, but now the internal battle for the post of Chief Minister seems to be coming out freely
 darasal, congress ke varisht netaa mallikarjun khadge ke bare main karnataka ke mukhyamantri ech di kumaraswami kii ek tippanee ko lekar unke or rajya main sattarudh gathbandhan samanvay samiti pramukh siddharmaiya ke bich tivetor par bahes chhid gai he
 Let us know that on Tuesday, Kumaraswamy had said about Kharge that he should have been offered this top post (chief Minister's post) long ago
 ise lekar rajya main sattarudh gathbandhan ke donon dalon- congress or jedies main saarvajanik rup se bahes chhid gai he
 Kumaraswamy's statement came at a time when there is increasing demand in the Congress party to make Siddaramaiah chief minister once again
 kumaraswami ke is bayaan ko purv mukhyamantri siddharmaiya ko maat dene kii koshish ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he, jinhone is pad ke liye apni mahatvakanksha kaa ishaara diya tha
 Siddaramaiah reacted in a very interesting manner to Kumaraswamy's statement
 unhone kaha ki peedblyoody mantri evam kumaraswami ke bade bhai echdi revanna bhi is sheersh pad ke liye kaabil hai
 He said, "what Kumaraswamy said is correct
 mallikarjun khadge ke paas na sirf mukhyamantri banane kii, balki isse ooncha pad paane kii bhi kaabiliyat he
 There are many people in Congress and JDS who are eligible to become Chief Minister
 ‚Äô‚Äô siddharmaiya ne ek twit main kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòech di revanna bhi unamem se ek hai
 Time comes for everything
 ‚Äô‚Äôkumaraswami ne kaha ki unki dili khwaahish he ki khadge ko mukhyamantri bananaa chahie or ise koi raajnneetik rang dena yaa iskaa thik se soche samajhe bagaiyr vishleshan karnaa sahi nahin he
 He said, "I have little interest in getting any political benefit through this statement
 ‚Äô‚Äôgauratlab he ki chincholi main mangalvaar ko kumaraswami ne kaha tha ki khadge ko bahut samay pehle hi mukhyamantri ban janaa chahie tha
 He mentioned that Kharge can also become the Chief Minister in the current congress-jds government but he (kharge) will abide by the decision of the party high command
 is bich, revanna ne siddharmaiya ke twit par pratikriya jaahir karte hue hasan main kaha ki purv mukhyamantri (siddharmaiya) unke ‚Äò‚Äòshubhachintak‚Äô‚Äô hai or jab tak unke bhai is sheersh pad par hai, unke (siddharmaiya ke) mukhyamantri pad kii daud main hone kaa koi sawaal hi nahin he
 They said, ''
 
 
 vah lambey samay se mere shubhachintak rahe hai, isliye unhone jo kuch kaha he us par main pratikriya nahin duungaa
 He loves me
 jab kumaraswami mukhyamantri hai, tab bhala main kaise ho saktaa hum
 "he said," This post is not vacant at the moment
 jab tak kumaraswami mukhyamantri hai tab tak hamamen se koi is daud main nahin he
 We brothers will not fight for this
 kumaraswami or devgauda ne jo kuch kaha he vah meraa ruukh he
 Later, Siddaramaiah clarified his statement saying that he had only said that there are many people who have the ability to become the Chief Minister and Revanna is one of them
 unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòmaine kabhi nahin kaha ki revanna ko mukhyamantri bananaa chahie
 
 
 It is not that Revanna should become Chief Minister by herself tomorrow
 
 
 avasar milane par koi bhi siem ban saktaa he
 Many people have ability
 ‚Äô‚Äôudhar, up mukhyamantri evam congress netaa ji parameshwar ne siddharmaiya kaa samarthan karte hue kalburgi main kaha ki siddharmaiya ke twit main kuch bhi galat nahin he kyonki vah or revanna kareeb the
 He said that he too aspires to become the Chief Minister but the post is not vacant at the moment

 His question is why the government did not object before the appointment and dragging the senior bureaucrat into controversy is wrong

 People living in the US who come from another country to work and live there are made a card called United statesperminant Resident Card
 yah card unhen united stats lophul parmmanent racidency ke tahat diya jaataa he
 Earlier it was also called Alien Registration Card
 iske tahat imigrents ko die jane vaale card kaa rang haraa hota he isliye yah green card kaha jane laga
 People who get this card can live in America forever and work there
 green cards kii validity 10 saal kii hoti he jiske baad ise yaa to rineu karana hota he yaa phir yah nayaa jari hota he
 Green card is also called an immigration process through which permanent citizenships are given to the immigrants
 green cards kii mukhya baaten- har saal america main 10 lakh logon ko green card die jate hai
 - Green card holders are not citizens of America nor can they vote
 - green card holders ko vahaan ke citijan na hone tak america passport nahin miltaa
 - Green card holders have to file US income tax
 - green card holders ko apni praathmik citijanship america kii rakhni hoti he
 - Indians have to wait for 10 to 35 years for a green card
 - 50 lakh log abhi bhi kar rahe hai green card kaa intjaar
 The Indian charges money from Indians who do not give back, about 30% of their salary is deducted as tax from the people who go to America from India
 wo unhen waapas tab miltaa he jab wo vahaan 5 saal tak kaam karte hon
 But most of them come back before 5 years

 When the person looks at his hands with full faith, he is confident that the gods will also be helpful in his auspicious deeds
 jab vah apane haathon par bharosa karke sakaaratmak kadam uthayega, to bhagya bhi uskaa saath degaa
 This belief works behind the sight of hands in the morning

 After a long time in Bihar politics, a big face is shown to be active in the role of opposition
 rashtriya janata dal (argedy) ke supremeo lalu yadav ke chote bete tejasvi yadav patna waapas aa gaye hai
 His return is a sign of reduced internal arrogance at the party, but these are just speculations
 raajnneetik jaankaron kaa kahana he ki party supremeo lalu yadav ke kehane par tejasvi ne vaapasi kii he
 Lalu Yadav has almost fulfilled Tejashwi's demand
 saath hi tejasvi ko jald party supremeo ke baad kaa pad bhi mil saktaa he
 He was missing during the floods and chilly fever, after the bitter defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, it was said that Tejashwi's party was not running well
 lalu yadav bhi unke kai faislon se khush nahin the
 Tejashwi was missing for 33 days after the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 july ke pehle hafte main vah saamne aae the
 After this, Tejashwi again disappeared
 chamaki bukhaar or bheeshan baadh ke dauraan bhi tejasvi kahin sakriy nahin the
 He played a zero role in the party

 Tejashwi, Tej Pratap and Misa did not reach the meeting on August 16, there was an important meeting of all the mlas, councilors, current and former district heads of the party at 10 Circular Road, the official residence of former Chief Minister Rabri Devi
 is baithak main argedy netaa tejasvi yadav, tej pratap yadav or misa bharti ko bhi shaamil hona tha, lekin ve teenon baithak main shaamil hone nahin pahunche
 Preparations were discussed in this meeting for the next year's assembly elections

 According to the police, the milk market near Patna Junction was broken into on Wednesday, the 5th day of the campaign against encroachment in Patna
 is dauraan doodh vikritaon dwaara virodh or jamkar hangaamaa kiya gaya
 In a separate speech of the party leaders, senior party MLA Bhai Virender had said that the party will continue to receive the blessings and guidance of Lalu Prasad Yadav, but making Tejashwi Yadav the national president is the demand of today's youth
 purv mantri vijay prakaash ne kaha tha ki rashtriya adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav jaisaa uchit samajhen faisla kar sakate hai
 Tejashwi Yadav is still handling the party
 haalanki party ke kai varisht netaa kaa maananaa he ki tejasvi yadav ne apane aacharan se sabhi ko niraash hi kiya he
 Although Tejashwi Yadav may get the post, but Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has a tough fight

 How a citizen of the country can show genuine respect for his army and soldiers, can increase the value of the tricolor, this is shown by a school teacher and her husband from Pune

 Her husband Yogesh worked at the State Bank of Mysore after taking VRS from the Indian Army, from where he has now retired
 ab chitade dampati kaa ek hi mishan he ki jaldi se jaldi siachin main oxigen plant lagane ke sapane ko puraa hote dekhnaa
 The Chitade couple have been involved in the welfare of jawans since 1999, but they started the mission to set up an oxygen plant in Siachen two years ago by building a trust named the Soldiers Independent Rehabilitation Foundation (SIRF)
 sumedha ke mutabik trust main unke alaava 5 or trustee hai
 Along with the trustees, close friends and relatives are also getting support for this sacred work
 chitade dampatine apane iklaute bete ko bhi sena main bheja
 Now he is in the rank of Major and is giving duty to the country on the outskirts
 sumedha chitade ke mutabik 1999 main javaanon ke kalyaan ke liye kaam karne ke dauraan hi unhen sahi se gyaat hua ki siachin main javaanon ko kin mushkil paristhitiyon main duty ke liye din-raat khadey rahanaa hota he
 In winter, the temperature here ranges from minus 30 to 60 degrees Celsius
 haddiyaan tak ko galaa dene vaali thand, tufaani hawaaon ke baavjood desh ke sachche sapoot sarhad kii nigaraanee ke liye 24 ghante mustaid rahete hai
 Located at an altitude of more than 22 thousand feet, Siachen is the highest battlefield in the world
 yahaan oxigen kii kami ke chalate javaanon ko swasthya sambandhi dikkaton se bhi jujhna padataa he
 Oxygen cylinders are transported through Chandigarh via Leh helicopters to Siachen
 is tarah oxigen kaa transportesan jahaan bahut kharchila hai vahiin kai baar kharaab mausam kii vajah se helicopters kaa udaan bharna bhi sambhav nahin hota
 The couple started selling jewelry to set up a plant in Siachen base to generate oxygen from the air at an altitude of 13 thousand feet
 is plant par kareeb sava karod rupye kharch kaa anumaan he
 Sumedha has started this sacred work by selling her jewelery and raising one and a quarter lakh rupees
 chitade dampati kaa kahana he ki abhi lanbaa rasta tay karnaa he lekin unhen bharosa he ki jaldi hi or logon ke bhi sahyog se plant lagane ke liye aavashyak dhanrashi ekatra kar lee jaaegi
 Sumedha says that if she had to sell any of her belongings for this sacred work in the future, she would not back down
 vahiin yogesh chitade kehete hai, siachin main oxigen plant lagata he to yahaan sarhad par tainaat 9,000 sainikon ko iskaa phayda milegaa
 This inaccessible area is very important for India
 andaaj hi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki yahaan mushkil halaat main har vakt date rah kar desh kii kitni badi seva kar rahe hai
 The Chitade couple do not forget to send sweets to the soldiers posted on the outskirts every year
 unki koshish rahati he ki desh ke liye praanon kaa balidaan karne vaale javaanon ko naman karne ke liye unke ghar jaakar parivaar waalon se milen
 Really, this feeling of Sumedha and Yogesh Chitade is worth saluting

 US expert on terrorism, Gary Laffrey, said on Monday that India's religious diversity and tolerance is acting as a deterrent against ISIS and the impact of ISIS is much less among the Indian population than in other countries
 neshnal centre for da study of terarysm and resapaunsis tu terarysm (start) ke nideshak lefari ne kaha, ‚Äòis desh kii yatra karne ke dauraan isaki dharmik vividhta or abhivyakti vaaki aakarshith karti he
 When ISIS is trying to create a rift between Islam and other religions, many religious organizations staying here in harmony are acting as a deterrent to it
 ‚Äôunhone kaha, ‚Äòjin deshon main ek dharm kaa prabhutv he, vahaan iesas ke liye muslimon ko ekajute karnaa aasaan he
 But this is not possible due to its diversity in India where so many religions, churches, mosques are together
 ‚Äôlefari ne kaha, ‚Äòbharat main iesas kaa asar bahut kam he
 In the US and Europe, we are concerned about ISIS
 ‚Äô iesas ko bhayaavah sanghathan qaraar dete hue unhone kaha ki iesas main netritv kii jaden gahari hai or ise samaapt karnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Laffrey, however, pointed out that terrorism based on religious fundamentalism is on the rise in India
 unhone kaha, ‚Äò2014 main vaishvik aatankwaadi hamalon kii suchi main bharat chauthe sthaan par aata he
 Before that there are Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq
 bharat main har tarah ke aatankwaad kaa asar he, chaahe dharmik ho, vampanthi ho, dakshinpanthi ho yaa anya or koi ho
