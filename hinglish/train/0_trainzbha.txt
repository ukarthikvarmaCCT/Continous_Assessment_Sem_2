 yahaan aap unke sahaj-saral or jujharu vyaktitv se sikh sakate hai bahut kuch
 
 
 1
 jo thaan liya wo karke dikhaanaa he
 
 
 (determination) There is not much difference between life and cricket pitch
 kai baar acha karte rahane ke baavjood achche riglts nahin aate, phir bhi aapako lagaataar lage rahanaa padataa he
 Sometimes you are out of the team
 aise main hataash-niraash hone ke bajaay basics or approach par dhyaan den

 Work hard
 
 
 (devotion)gauratlab he ki kumble bhartiya cricket team main bataur leg spinner shaamil hue or usee ke taur par ant tak bane rahe, lekin dhire-dhire ve medium pesar kii speed se gend phenkane lage
 With his sharp and fast balls, he reminded the good batsmen of the sixth milk
 wo baaten jo kohli ko banaati hai viraat
 
 
 3
 anushaasan hi safalataa kii seedhi he
 
 
 (discipline) It often happens to all of us that we knowingly or unconsciously ignore many rules, but Kumble has always been known as a man who has been given priority over established rules
 shaayad anushaasit hone kii vajah se hi ve itane lambey samay tak bhartiya cricket team kaa hissaa bana rahe
 We also need to learn discipline from them

 (dedication) It seems that Kumble never said goodbye to cricket
 ve lagaataar khel ke tach main rahe
 After his departure from the Indian cricket team, he also continued to spread in the IPL
 hameshaa khud ko khel ke nae rules va regulations se apadet rakhaa
 Perhaps this was the reason that despite all the stalwarts of the country and the world, he was nominated as the coach of the Indian cricket team
 or bhi gaur karne laayak unki kuch khubiyaan-5
 Always keep yourself restrained
 
 
 anil kumble ko hameshaa se aise khilaadi ke taur par janaa jaataa rahaa he jo kinhin vipareet paristhitiyon main aapa nahin khote
 Smiles continue even in adverse circumstances
 ve aise muves banaate hai ki vipakshi chakma kha jaaen
 If you have water then success like Saina

 Always keep the team ahead
 
 
 ab is baat se to sabhi waakif hai ki cricket ek team game he jahaan vyaktigat records kii bhi apni ahmiyat hoti he
 Kumble holds the title of being the most successful match winner in Indian cricket
 ek aise desh main jahaan sirf ballebaajon ko jeet kaa shrey diya jaataa ho
 In the same country, Anil Kumble's arrival on the Indian plank says a lot

 donon ke bich rishton main khatas tabhi dekhi gai jab 18 saansadon vaalishivasena ko modi sarkaar main mahaj ek berth mili
 Salt was sprinkled on Shiv Sena burn when PM Modi not only included Shiv Sena leader Suresh Prabhu in the cabinet without Uddhav's consent, but also gave him important portfolios like Ministry of Railways
 modi kii nitiyon kaa virodhmodi kii bullate train ho yaa notebandi, paak niti ho yaa kisaanon kii karjamaafee shivasena lagaataar modi sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhti rahi he
 On the other hand, the BJP also never paid any heed to the sharp stance of Shiv Sena
 modi mantrimandal main teen baar vistaar kar chuke hai lekin shivasena kii andekhi hi hui
 The party has openly expressed its displeasure over it, but neither PM Modi nor BJP President Amit Shah is willing to succumb to its demand
 gathbandhan main nahin ladaa BMC chunaavshivsena or bijepi ke bich kii talkhi sabase zyada tab dekhi gai jab donon partiyon ne apane dashakon se chale aa rahe gathbandhan ko todate hue maharashtra main alag-alag vidhansabha chunaav ladane kaa elaan kiya
 Here too, Shiv Sena had to face the loss
 nattejey bijepi ke paksh main gaye or shivasena ke paas fadanvis sarkaar kaa hissaa banane ke sivaa koi chaara nahin rahaa
 Even in the same year BMC elections were fought separately by both parties
 shivasena ne bijepi ke saath gathbandhan ko lekar antim faisle kii ghoshnaa bhale hi kar di ho lekin uske liye alag hone kaa faisla karnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 The party will have to pay the price of separation from the NDA by going out of power at the Center and the state
 jabaki uske alag hone se centre sarkaar par koi asar nahin padegaa or maharashtra kii fadanvis sarkaar ke paas bhiensipi se milakar sarkaar bachaneka vikalp khulaa rahegaa
 In such a situation, will Uddhav Thackeray be able to show such courage, to get away from the NDA on public issues and increase his support by taking to the streets against the BJP
 sitambar 2012 main mamata banerjee ne yahi kiya tha
 Significantly, Trinamool Congress President Mamata Banerjee, who was enraged by the increase in FDI in retail and the price of diesel, decided to quit the Manmohan government in UPA-2
 mamata banerjee ne iske liye 72 ghante kaa ultimatum diya or uske baad 18 sitambar 2012 ko apana ultimatum khatm hone par centre sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya
 Mamta also had 19 mps
 mamata ko apane in baagi tewaron kaa phayda bhi mila
 In the 2014 elections, when the Congress was swept and the party was reduced to just 44 mps, Mamata Banerjee's seats increased from 19 to 34 and TMC is now the fourth largest party in the Lok Sabha

 in donon deshon ke netaaon ke darmiyaan baat ab is had tak bad gai he ki jang kaa khatra sir uthaane laga he
 Rust can begin at any time
 aise main zaruri ho jaataa he ki ham ye jaan len ki agar aisa hua to tabaahi kii aanch kahaan tak pahonchegi
 Is this the call of world war? kyonki ek taraf arab desh to duusari taraf korian peninsula jang ke jwalamukhi par baitha he
 And above all, America is leaving no stone unturned to punish the dictator of North Korea
 ab kahin jang chhid gai to andaja lagaaie ki phir kya hoga?america kii taraf he north korea kaa nishanaghabrahat sab main hai, itminan kisi ko nahin
 There is peace that it does not come and why it will come
 halaat hi ab kuch aise hai
 On one hand, South Korea, America, Japan and China are armed with their own weapons
 bas bigul phunke jane kaa intazaar he
 On the other hand, the North Korean dictator standing alone in the field is in a tussle about where he should turn his missiles
 isliye usne tay kiya he ki hamalaa kahin se bhi ho uski mixilon kaa ruukh sirf ek taraf hoga or wo he america
 This North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has a valid reason for this
 kyonki syria par hamale ke baad ab america kaa ravaiyya puri tarah se jang kaa ho gaya he or isiilie usne korian peninsula main apane jangi jahaazon ko bheja he
 So Kim Jong-un has given America the last warning to be ready for war
 akelaa pad gaya he north koriakim jong kii is jhunjhalaahat ko samajhnaa he to is nakshe ko pehle samajhie kyonki iske baad tasviir zyaada saafe ho jaaegi
 Even though the distance of America from here is about 10 thousand kilometers, but the border of South Korea is like that
 or america ke duusare saathi japan kii duuri mahaz ek hazaar kilometre he
 Relations with China are not much better
 kyonki kim jong kii zahreeli mixilon se khauf use bhi he
 Russia is the only country in its neighborhood of Le de with whom it has had a friendly relationship with the communists
 magar maujuuda vakt main halaat aise hai ki uttar korea khud ko akelaa hi samajhataa he
 On his own, he is not only ready to take the iron from America, but is also filling the battle of equality
 hathiyaaron se pehle zubaani jangdusari taraf america kii trump sarkaar bhi puri taiyaari kiye baithi he
 It has sent its strike groups on the Korean peninsula
 jisamen nimitz class aircraft bhi he
 The USS Carl Vinson also includes two missile destroyers and a guided missile cruiser in addition to a carrier wing
 ab zaahir he north korea kii choukhat ke itane nazadik aakar america agar apni takat dikhayega to kim bhi chup baithne waalon main se to he nahin
 Hence the war of words has started before the war of arms
 america ne kii jang kii taiyaariuttar korea ke videsh mantralay ne kaha he ki america kaa jahaaz bhejne kaa faisla jaldbaazi main uthaaya gaya kadam he
 He is trying to penetrate our borders
 agar america jang chahta he to democratic pipuls republic of korea (north korea) iske liye taiyaar he
 In fact, immediately after the attack on Syria, the confidence of Donald Trump has increased
 isliye trump administration ke korian peninsula main jangi jahaaj bhejne ke is faisle ko kim jong-un ke liye final warning mana ja rahaa he
 However, Trump has also told his advisors that if Pyongyang adopts a soft approach, they may consider other options
 magar maujuuda halaat dekhakar aisa lagata to nahin hai
 On the other hand, the case of China on the attack on North Korea is also seen as disastrous
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki china ko kim se khatra to he magar itnaa bhi nahin ki wo america ke saath khadaa ho jaae
 America is also understanding, so it has also said that if China does not support, then it alone will take action against North Korea
 newclear test kar saktaa he north koreahalanki america ke liye north korea par hamalaa karnaa itnaa aasaan bhi nahin hoga kyonki wo jaanata he ki duniya ke is sabase sanakee taanashaah ke paas kai aisi misile hai, jo america tak newclear dhamaakaa karne kii salaahiyat rakhti hai
 On the occasion of the 105th anniversary of his grandfather Kim Sang, who founded North Korea, there is a possibility that he may do the sixth nuclear test
 aise main agar jang ke halaat banate hai ki to ye kaha ja saktaa he ki america kaa to pataa nahin magar uttar korea ke paas khone ke liye kuch nahin he
 There may be a fierce battle in the Korean sea
 In the present time, if America is threatened by anyone, then it is the crazed dictator of North Korea
 lihaaza raashtrapati trump ne apane tewaron se saaf kar diya he ki is baar america aar-paar ke mood main he
 By landing its warships in the Korean Peninsula, the United States has given a final warning to North Korea, and if Kim Jong Un's resolute attitude does not change, then the Korean Peninsula's sea will be in a fierce rage

 ) Former Pakistan President and military ruler Pervez Musharraf may have prepared for his return to Pakistan, but upon hearing the news of his return, the Taliban have threatened him that if he returns to Pakistan, he will be transported to the Dozakh (hell)
 parvej musharrafne apane liye agrim jamaanat kii vyavastha karke giraftaar kii sambhaavna kam kar lee he
 But it remains to be seen whether this threat from the Taliban has any effect on his return
 talibanon kii ore se jari kiye gaye ek video main kaha gaya he ki islam ke mujahidinon ne musharraf ko narak pahunchane ke liye ek khaas dasta taiyaar kiya he
 The squad consists of fidayeen, gunmen, a special assault team and a rescue team
 musharraf ko pakistan naa lautne kii salaah: reportgauratlab he ki musharraf ne jihadiyon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai karke taliban sanghathanon ko khaasaa naaraaz kar diya tha
 Earlier, Musharraf said on Saturday that he would return home on Sunday to participate in the historic election to be held in May and that he was also willing to risk his life
 pakistan kii adaalat dwaara agrim jamaanat manjuur kiye jane ke kuch hi ghante baad musharraf ne ye baat kahi thi
 The court has made way for Musharraf to return home by giving him 10 days bail in various cases, free from the fear of being arrested immediately after nearly five years of self-exile
 saal 1999 main satta par kabja karne or saal 2008 main raashtrapati kaa pad chhodane vaale musharraf pakistan main hatya kii sajeesh rachane or avaidh tareeke se nyaayadhishon ko giraftaar karne ke maamle main vaanchit hai
 He had said, 'two hundred percent
 
 i am going to Pakistan on Sunday
 ’ unhone kaha tha, ‘main sadak, vaayu or samudr kisi bhi maarg se jaaoongaa
 Then even if my life is in danger
 yah kasam main apane desh ke liye letaa hum
 According to Musharraf, "there will be no arrest and nothing will happen
" maine tay kiya tha ki faisla chaahe jo bhi ho waapas jaaoongaa, lekin vah paksh main rahaa

 While some habits make you healthy, there are some habits that can make you sick
 aise main ye jaananaa bahut jaruri ho jaataa he ki wo koun se kaam hai jo subah uthne ke baad nahin karne chahie
 1
 dhumrapaan karanaayun to dhumrapaan chaahe kisi bhi vakt kiya jaae, nuksaandeh hi hota he lekin subah sokar uthne ke turant baad cigarette pinaa bahut adhik khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 This greatly increases the risk of getting cancer
 2
 Alcoholics are people who start their morning by drinking alcohol
 subah uthne ke saath hi sharaab pinaa sehat ke liye bahut nuksaandeh hota he
 3
 ladaai-jhagada karnadin kii shuruyaat sakaaratmak honi chahie
 It is not right to get entangled with someone as you wake up in the morning
 isse dinabhar aapkaa mood kharaab hi bana rahegaa or aap kisi bhi kaam main apana sau fisadi nahin de paaenge
 4
 masaaledaar khanasubah ke samay bahut adhik masaaledaar khaanaa khaane se parhez karnaa chahie
 The more light and nutritious you can eat in the morning, the better
 5
 Coffee drinking Most people in the world are those who start their morning with a cup of coffee
 par visheshgyon kii maane to subah coffee pine se cortisol (ek hormone kaa naam, jo protein or carbohydrate ke metabolism main sakriy bhoomika nibhaataa he
 ) Level increases
 kaam kii shuruyaat karne ke baad coffee kaa seven karnaa phydemand rahata he

 bhadakaau chijen dekhnugar aap bhi subah uthne ke saath hi tivi kholkar baith jate hai to is baat kaa khyaal rakhen ki aap kuch bhi aisa na dekhen jo bhadakaau ho
 It directly affects your work and mood
 7
 Staying here and there will be most of us who would not like to get up in the morning
 kuch to aise bhi honge jo subah bistar se uthne ke baad ghar main hi idhar-udhar let jate honge
 This is a wrong habit, due to which you do not feel fresh even after your sleep is complete

 Even today, in the rainy season, a small river Ghaggar flows from here for a few days, but what is the status of this rainy puddle in front of the Mahanadi, which has one of the oldest civilizations of the world ever in its lap

 Oldham then gave the first hypothesis that it might not be, it is the valley of the ancient giant river Saraswati, which used to get water from the Sutlej River
 or jise rishi-muniyon ne rugveda (richa 2

 The description of this terrain in the Rigveda mentions the presence of five rivers Jhelum, Chenab, Sutlej, Ravi and Vyasa between the Indus in the west and the Saraswati river in the east
 rugveda (richa 7
 36
 6) main saraswati ko sindhu or anya nadiyon kii maa bataaya gaya he
 The disappearance of this river gave Oldham the idea that nature changed its course and the waters of the Sutlej turned the Indus River
 bechaari saraswati suukh gai
 In more than a century, science and technology gained momentum and many hypotheses cutting across each other about the appearance of Saraswati came out

 Satellite images found in the 1990s revealed to the world the rough blueprint of that river for the first time
 in nakshon main kareeb 20 kimi chaudaai main himalay se arab sagar tak jameen ke andar nadi ghati jaisi akruti dikhaai detii he
 Now the curiosity was that no river could flow in such a width, then what was the exact route and shape of that river? And what is the true story of its extinction? To find the answers to these questions, in late 2011 experts from IIT Kanpur along with Kashi Hindu University (varanasi) and Imperial College, London, started research
 ''is pariyojna main hamane electrical racistivity sounding takanic kaa prayog kiya
 The exact thickness of the water layers within the ground is estimated by this technique

 The river flowed near the Bronze Age and Harappan archeological sites

 However, there may be other reasons for the extinction of civilization

 "this paper came out after the completion of the first phase of the plan and it will continue westward in the vanishing Saraswati valley in search of evidence

 The study started from the village of Sirhind, far away from the current stream of Ghaggar river and the first results were startling
 sinha bataate hai, ''darasal 1980 ke yashpal ke shodhpatr main is jagah par ghaghghar-hakara nadiyon kii lupt ho chuki sambhavit sahaayak nadi kii maujuudagi kii baat kahi gai thi

 This valley is 20 km underground

 The special thing is that in Sirhind, there is no such indication on the surface that one can guess that such a big river valley exists below the ground
 balki yahaan to jameen ke thik neeche bahut sakht sataha he
 Such a large amount of water may not be in the tributary but in the main river

 After all, how dry Saraswati? Then how did these rivers separate? Rajesh Purohit, an archaeologist studying the Valley of the extinct Saraswati River for the past 20 years and director of the Allahabad Archaeological Museum, says, "over time, the glaciers that fed the Saraswati River have dried up
 in halaat main yaa to nadi kaa bahaav khatm ho gaya yaa phir sindhu, sutluj or yamuna jaisi baad kii nadiyon ne is nadi ke bahaav kshetra par kabja kar liya
 During this entire process, the water of the Saraswati river drifted towards the east and the water of the Sutlej river shifted towards the west
 baad kii sabhyataaen ganga or uski sahaayak nadi yamuna (purvavarti chambal) ke taton par viksit huin
 Earlier there was no Yamuna river and Chambal river used to flow
 lekin uthapatak ke daur main himachal pradesh main ponta sahib ke paas nai nadi yamuna ne saraswati ke jal strot par kabja kar liya or aage jaakar isamen chambal bhi mil gai
 "that is, Satluj, a tributary of Saraswati, migrated along with it to the west and got into the Indus and in the east the Saraswati and Yamuna emerged in the valley of Chambal
" aise main is baat ko bal miltaa he ki bhale hi prayag main ganga-yamuna-saraswati ke sangam kaa koi bhubhautikeey sakshya na miltaa ho lekin yamuna ke saraswati ke jalmaarg par kabje kaa pramaan in nadiyon ke alag tarah ke rishte kii ore ishaara karata he
 On the other hand, the Thar desert came in the midst of the original paths through which Saraswati used to flow
 lekin is nadi ke puraane rup kaa varnan rugveda main miltaa he
 Verse of the Rigveda (7
 36
 6) states, "O the seventh river Saraswati, which is the mother of the Indus and other rivers and makes the land fertile, give us abundant food together and irrigate it with our water
" ”iity kanpur ke adhyayan main bhi nadi kaa kuch aisa hi purana rup nikhar kar saamne aata he
 Data based on sound resistivity suggest that near Kalibanga and Munak villages, there exists a complex structure of clear river basins filled with clear water under the ground
 in donon jagahon par kiye gaye adhyayan main pataa chalaa ki jameen ke bheetar 12 kimi se adhik chaudee or 30 meter moti mithe pani se bhari ret kii tah he
 Whereas the width of the existing Ghaggar river is only 500 meters and the depth is only five meters
 jameen ke bheetar maujuud mithe pani se bhari ret ek jatil sanrachana dikhaati he, jisamen bahut-si alag-alag dharaaen ek badi nadi main milti dikhti hai
 In Sinha's words, "this complex structure shows a river that existed in a period of more rain and water present than today, or now flows elsewhere due to the division of the water of the rivers
" ” adhyayan aage bataata he ki is mithe pani se bhari ret se upar keechad se bhari ret kii parat he
 The thickness of this layer is about 10 meters
 gaad se bhari yah parat us daur kii ore ishaara karti he, jab nadi kaa pani suukh gaya or uske upar keechad kii parat jamati chali gai
 These two layers are proof that the ancient river flowed in great shape and later dried up

 The series of civilizational evidence that reached the banks of the Ganges from Saraswati does not stop here

 Shashank Shekhar explains, "the types of earthen mounds found on both sides of the Ghaggar river in Kalibanga can only be built around a large river valley
 ” or jis tarah se kalibanga ke dhuhon ke neeche se hadappa kaal ke avshesh milte hai, usase is baat ko bal miltaa he ki saraswati nadi or hadappa samskruti ke bich koi sidhaa rishta tha
 Kalibanga is not the only archeological site but 12 such large collapses have been identified in Hanumangarh and Sriganganagar districts of Rajasthan
 hadappa sabhyataa ke avshesh pashchim main gujarat tak or purv main meerut tak mili hai
 At the same time, archaeological evidence of the new phase of Harappan civilization has been found in Kaushambi near Allahabad

 Manoj Gautam says, "only the remains of the pre-harappan period are found on the banks of the ghaggar-hakra or Vedic Saraswati
 jabaki kaushambi ke paas purv hadappa or nav hadappa kaal ke avshesh ek saath mili hai
 These references can be seen as the disappearance of Saraswati river and the development of new civilization on the banks of ganga-yamuna

 The satellite image shows that the Saraswati valley traveled to Kurukshetra, Kaithal, Fatehabad, Sirsa, Anupgarh in Haryana, Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh in Rajasthan, the Thar Desert and then the Gulf of Khambhat in Gujarat

 There are many such borewells in Rajasthan's Jaisalmer district, from which water has been coming out automatically for many years
 ye borwell 1998 main mishan saraswati yojana ke tahat bhumigat nadi kaa pataa lagane ke liye khode gaye the

 However science does not agree with faith in one thing and this disagreement also has very serious meaning
 manyata he ki saraswati lupt hokar jameen ke andar bah rahi he, jabaki iity kaa shodh kahata he ki nadi bah nahin rahi he, balki uski bhumigat ghati main jal kaa bada bhandar he
 Pro
 sinha aagaah karte hai ki aise main agar lupt nadi ghati se lagaataar bade paimaane par borwell ke jariye pani nikaala jaataa rahaa to pataal main paithi nadi hameshaa ke liye suukh jaaegi, kyonki usamen nae pani kii aapurti nahin ho rahi he
 They are doing the correct measurement of Saraswati to tell which water is normal ground water and which is the protected water of Saraswati
 vaigyanik to yahi chaahate hai ki pataal main jami nadi ke pani kaa behisaab istemaal na kiya jaae kyonki agar aisa kiya jaataa rahaa to jo saraswati koi 4,000 saal pehle sataha se gaayab hui thi, vah ab pataal se bhi gaayab ho jaaegi

 is baar metric kii pariksha main state topper rahe lakhisarai ke prem kumaar jabaki duusare or tisare sthaan par jamui ke bhavy kumari or harshitha kumari ne baaji maari
 These students brought good numbers in the matriculation examination and became the toppers, but the Bihar Vidyalaya Examination Committee, which has been facing problems due to the toppers scam for the last 2 years, did not believe whether these students and girls really deserve to become toppers or not
 khaskar tab jab is saal kii intermediat pariksha main 42 saal keganesh kumaarane farji janm praaanpatr banaakar apane aap ko 24 saal kaa bataaya or intermediat kii pariksha main arts topper ban gaya
 The Bihar School Examination Committee was so alarmed by this year's incident that it thought of thoroughly investigating all the toppers after which their names were announced
 sabase pehlebihar bordne 4 sadsy ek cameti banaai jisane sabhi toparon ke uttar patrika ko dobaaraa se jaanch kiya
 Subsequently, the committee conducted physical verification of all these toppers
 uske baad in toparon kaa bakaayaa board ne intervyuu bhi liya or yah jaancha ki vaaki yah topper banane ke laayak he yaa phir nahin
 After this, the process of physical verification started again
 bhautik satyaapan ke liye bihar board ne in sabhi toparon ko ek-ek karke board ke daftar bulaanaa shuru kiya or unke bare main puri tareeke se jaanch padtaal kii
 There were also many tops who were not in Patna or Bihar at the time of physical verification, in such a situation, the Bihar Board not only paid the cost of airplane for such students to go to Patna but also to the students coming from the train
 Expenses provided bihar vidhyalay pariksha samitike chairman anand kishor ne 'aaj tak' se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki bihar board main aaj tak bhautik satyaapan kii parampara kabhi nahin rahi he magar is baar metric kii pariksha se yah nai system ko lagu kiya gaya
 For this, permission was obtained after informing the state government only after which physical verification of the toppers was possible
 gauratlab he ki anand kishor ne is baat kaa bhi khulaasa kiya ki is baar kai aise chaatr the jo is pariksha main fail ho rahe the magar unhen gres number dekar paas karaayaa gaya
 The surprising thing is that despite getting the grace number, the percentage of children who passed it was only around 50

 Bukkal Nawab of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLC of Uttar Pradesh, who is at the center of discussion with his earnest, has given clarification on calling Hanuman a Muslim
 unhone somvaar ko kaha ki hanuman ko musalmaan kehane par agar koi aahat hua he to main kshamaa maangata hum
 But for me Hanuman was still a Muslim
 unhone 'ajtak' se vishesh baatcheet main kaha ki hanuman ko musalmaan bolne par hua hangaamaa behad hi khedjanak he
 Bukkal Nawab said that Hanuman was called a Muslim because his whole family and his entire generation are devotees of Hanuman
 unhone kaha, 'lakhanu se lekar ayodhya tak hanuman mandir banavaane se lekar hanumangadhi tak ke jirnoddhar main hamaare parivaar kaa yogadan rahaa he
 Many Hanuman temples were built by the Nawabs in Lucknow
 uttar pradesh ke sabase prasiddh hanuman mandir hanumangadhi kaa jirnoddhar kai sau saal pehle hamaare purvajon ne kiya tha
 BJP MLC said that Hanuman gets his name from Muslims, and we believe that there are many prophets who do not know the name, then Hanuman is a Muslim to me
 lekin agar kisi ko hamaari baat se thes lagi he yaa koi aahat hua he to main use kshamaa maangata hum
 Bukkal Nawab brought out several texts from Geeta Press Gorakhpur and showed the names of Nawabs among the devotees of Hanuman
 kai prasang dikhaaen jisamen inaki peedi ne hanuman mandir banawaye hai yaa hanuman kii seva kii he yaa hanuman kii puja se unki mannaten puri hui hai
 By showing this basis, the Bukkal Nawab still personally considers Hanuman as a Muslim
 bukkal nawab ne kaha ki musalamaanon ke naam hanuman se milte julate hai
 For example, Suleman, Rehman and Rehan etc
 unhone kaha ki hanuman bhakton kii ek lambii parampara islam main bhi unke maanane waalon kii rahi he
 So personally i believe that Hanuman was also a Muslim
 hanuman musalmaan hi the, main yah nahin kahata, lekin agar musalmaan dharm ke log maanate hai to isamen buraai kya he
 The BJP leader said, 'my father built Hanuman temple of Aliganj
 200 saal pehle hanumangadhi kaa jirnoddhar karavaaya
 About 100 acres of land was given by the family of Nawabs to Hanumangarhi
 lakhanu main kai mandir aaj bhi musalamaanon ke banaae hue hai
 The moon star is still on the Hanuman temple that Alia Begum built
 isliye agar musalmaan bhi hanuman ko maanate hai yaa main yah kahata hum ki hanuman musalmaan the to isamen kya buraai he

 mumbai ke mantralay kii building main lagi aag main kab kya hua padhein puri report
 
 
 The fire in Mumbai's ministry is still not completely extinguished
 lekin fire brigade ne khushkhabari sunai he ki aag par kaabo paaya jane laga he
 But 6 people including four policemen have been injured in this fire
 inamen se ek kii haalat gambhir bataai ja rahi he
 Seeing the flames, it was not difficult to guess how terrible the fire was
 vahaan aasmaan kaale dhuen se bhar gaya or imaarat se lagaataar nikal rahi thim aag kii lapten
 The fire broke out in Mumbai's most powerful building
 taqatwar isliye kyonki yahaan soobe ke siem se lekar tamaam mantriyon or sachivon kaa daftar he
 02 in the afternoon
 50 bajedopaher do bajkar pachaas minute par mumbai ke mantralay kii teesri manzil par tribal ministry main chingaari uthi
 But before anyone could understand the seriousness of the matter, the fire broke out and the way to get down from the third-fifth, sixth floor was closed
 dopaher 03
 At 05 am, within fifteen minutes of the fire, the sirens of the fire brigade's vehicles started buzzing and the fire brigade trains as well as the jawans were deployed to extinguish the fire
 aapako bataa den ki isi building main maharashtra ke mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan kaa chhathi manzil par daftar he or aag lagi to wo bhi isamen funs gaye
 The fire brigade started a rescue operation using ropes and people were evacuated from the building
 jabaki iske saath hi jari tha aag bujhane kaa kaam
 04 in the afternoon
 00 bajefire brigade kii ek ghante tak lagaataar koshishon ke baavjood aag kaabo main nahin ai or teesri manzil kii aag se chauthaa-paanchavaa floor bhi dadhak uthaa
 According to tribal development minister Baban Rao Pachpute, the fire started on the air conditioner as soon as the fire broke out on the third floor
 wo apane daftar se bhaage
 He took his associate cabinet minister Jayant Patil from the third floor and came out of the building
 lekin bees minute ke andar mantralay kaa adhiktar hissaa aag kii lapaton se ghir chukaa tha
 There were suspicions that some people may have hidden on the roof to escape the fire
 shaam 04
 At 56 am, after more than an hour of the fire had started, the Navy helicopter started hovering at Mantralaya building
 javaanon ne mantralay ke chat par chappe-chappe kaa jayja liya
 But thankfully, no human was trapped on the roof
 jabaki maukey par marcos or rapid ection force ko bhi rescue ke liye bula liya gaya
 06 evening
 00 bajeag lagane ke teen ghante baad fire brigade ne raahat bhari khabar thi
 The fire was controlled to some extent on the third, fourth and fifth floors
 raat 10
 At 00 pm, 2 bodies were found from the sixth floor in the fire in the Ministry building of Mumbai
 donon log up-mukhyamantri se milane baraamati se mumbai aae the
 Even at this time, the building fire could not be completely controlled
 haratalika teej (hartalika Teej 2019) kii mahima ko aprampar mana gaya he
 The significance of this festival is very much in Hinduism especially for Suhagin women
 hariyaali teej (hariyali Teej) or kajri teej (kajari Teej) kii tarah hi haratalika teej (hartalika Teej) ke din bhi gauri-shankar kii puja kii jaati he
 Fasting of Hartalika Teej is extremely difficult
 is din mahilaayein 24 ghante se bhi adhik samay tak nirjala vrath karti hai
 Not only this, women wake up at night and open the fast the next day only after duly worshiping
 manyata he ki haratalika teej kaa vrath karne se suhaagin mahila ke pati kii umr lambii hoti he jabaki kunvaari ladakiyon ko manachaaha var miltaa he
 This festival is mainly celebrated in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh
 karnataka, tamilnadu or andhra pradesh main is vrath ko "gauri hubba" (gowri Habba) ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Some experts say that the fast of Teerthal Teej should be kept on September 1, because then Tritiya will remain throughout the day
 tark yah bhi he ki haratalika teej kaa vrath hast nakshatra main kiya jaataa he, jo ki 1 sitambar ko he
 At the same time, some believe that the fast of Hartalika Teej should be observed on September 2 instead of September 1

 His latest release 'bullet Raja' may not have done well on the box, but there is no denying that Saif Ali Khan wants his films to earn 100 crores and more
 jaisaa ki saf kehete hai, 'lagaataar seleble actor bane rahanaa acha he'
 Saif is now more settled in his married life than the first time and he jokingly says, "I hope i am short of a nightmare"
 ek snehi pita hone ke naate saf apane bete ibrahim kii skool banks karne kii aadat se pareshaan hai or ek pati hone ke naate shikaayat karte hai ki karina unase zyada kaam karwaati hai
 Here is an excerpt from Pataudi's conversation with Nawab Saif: Question: Earlier you used to do only one film at a time, now you have changed your strategy
 jawaab:(hansate hue) haa thodi si
 i am doing three films in a year
 kisi ko bhi kaam karnaa chahie or zyada output dena chahie
 And i am happy to do so
 main khush hum or jindagi main settle hum
 i am ready to focus on more things
 sawaal:kis vajah se badlaav aayaa?jawaab:kaisaa badlaav?sawaal:pehle aap is baat ko lekar bahut spasht the ki aapako ek saal main ek hi film kerani he
 Answer: One film at a time? Question: Yes, like Kareena was doing three to four films at a time and you wanted to do one film at a time
 jawaab:kisi ne mujhase poocha tha ki aap karina ko kaise prabhavit karte hai or karina aapako kaise prabhavit karti hai
 So maybe this is how we are influencing each other
 wo mujhase zyada kaam karvaa rahi hai
 Question: It is a challenge to stay fit at the age of 44
 Answer: Yes, it is becoming more and more important
 isse acha bhi lagata he
 It is nice to be at this stage of age and to adjust to the body
 meraa matlab he ki agar aap kuch galat karte hai to aapako pataa hota he
 If you do something good, you feel good
 mujhe chips kaa packet khaane kaa man nahin hota
 i think it's a bad habit
 sawaal:iskaa matalak yah he ki ab aap lej ke chips kaa vigyaapan nahin karenge?jawaab:main vigyaapan karuunga lekin meri koshish rahegi ki main ise kam khaauun kyonki mujhe lagata he ki aapako apane cholesterol par dhyaan rakhana chahie
 Everything should be in the right way
 sawaal:kya unke paas backed chips nahin hai?jawaab:mujhe ab chips khaane hai
 (voices his spot boy) Abdul, please bring a bare ledge for me please
 tumato sos ke saath! mere skool ke zyaadaatar saathi ab shape main nahin hai
 So diet, exercise and comfort should be everything
 sawaal:aapaki duusari shaadi ne aapako kya sikhaaya jo aap shaayad pehali baar nahin samaj paae?jawaab:jindagi ek safar kii tarah he
 It would be wrong to compare the two weddings
 ummid he ki main ek bure sapane se kam hum
 Also i was very young at that time
 main majaak kar rahaa hum
 The thing i want to say is that i am more mature now
 mujhe chijen samaj main aati hai or main ab kai duusare tareekon se bhi sochane ke liye taiyaar hum or yah main pehle nahin karata tha
 Question: Are you still nervous at the release of the film? Answer: Yes, i am
 mujhe film nirmaan ke har pahalu se pyaar he or is industry kaa hissaa banakar main bahut khush hum
 i like to think how to make a film
 agar koi film kii kahani sunaata he to main aaj bhi so jaataa hum isliye mujhe script padhanaa pasand he
 Question: Being a lead actor, is there pressure on you to be a part of a film that does a business of 100 crores? Answer: No pressure, but it is a good thing to be a celebrity actor who also works in big hit films 
 yah jaruri he
 Numbers are increasing day by day
 ek saath sari filmein acha nahin kar saktin
 Now this figure has reached 200 crores
 'barfi' ne bhi 100 karod kaa bijness kiya
 It was a good film
 main aisi film karnaa bhi pasand karuunga jisamen zyada kamai karne kii gunjaaish naa ho
 Question: There is no dispute that your mother's contribution to cinema is more than you
 to kya aapako unase pehle padmashri nahin mila?jawaab:nahin, unhen padam bhushan mila
 And i feel that i do not deserve Padma Shri
 lekin mujhe lagata he ki chaahe neshnal aword ho yaa padam shri mujhe jo kuch bhi mila vah main samay ke saath kamanaa chahta hum jahaan main pichhe mudakar dekhuun to kahuun, haa, ab yah cinema ke prati athulaneey yogadan he
 But i feel that my work is getting better day by day
 sawaal:aisa lagata he ki aapaki beti sara bhi actor banane ja rahi he
 What does your son Ibrahim want to grow up to be at this age? Answer: Playing cricket and school bunk
 lekin agar skool main ruchi naa hona achievement he to main thodaa chintit hum
 Question: Are you saying this because Kareena is a college dropout? Answer: i am saying this because Sarah is at Columbia University
 mujhe karina se kuch kehane kii jarurat nahin he kyonki main khud college nahin gaya hum

 jiske baad se rajya ke vibhinn hisson main barish shuru ho gai

 Is Lalit Modi right or wrong? Is he a wicked fugitive or a whistleblower who doesn't care? Is this man a human bomb or a warrior? There is no point repeating these questions
 do hafte se in sawaalon par bahes ho rahi he or inkaa jawaab nahin mil sakaa he
 All his claims, revelations and allegations, as well as two conversations with the India Today group, prove just one thing to him that some part of all the above nouns are definitely inside him
 isiilie yah sawaal poocha janaa kahin behatar hoga ki aakhir behatar kya he? lalit (pehla naam isliye taaki pradhanmantri se unhen alag bartaa ja sake, isliye nahin ki ham dost hai) kii nigaah main dost hona yaa dushman? yaa or kaayade se puuchhen toh donon main koun-sa zyada bura hoga?unki donon doston, sushamaa swaraj or vasundhara raaje se yah sawaal poochkar dekhie, jinhen bijepi kii aalaa netaa mana jaataa he or bhavishya main bade pad kii daavedaar bhi mana ja rahaa tha
 Now apart from the question of whether she will survive or not, one thing is true that friendship with Lalit has caused her permanent damage
 yah sawaal aap lalit ke dushmano se bhi puch sakate hai, chaahe ve cricket jagat se hon (arun jetali, rajeev shukla, en
 Srinivasan) or politics (pranab Mukherjee, his trusted aide Omita Paul and even the Gandhi family)
 unke media ke dushmano se bhi yah sawaal poocha ja saktaa he, khaskar times samooh ke vineet jain or prime time ke jaj tathaa dandadhikari arnab goswami se
 Fine fires are burning and everyone is scorching, however, right on the TV screen
 aap is baat ko lekar aashwast ho sakate hai ki har koi, raaje or swaraj bhi, unhen kos rahaa hoga
 Friends left, enemies are cursing
 iske baavjood lalit ne 15 dinon kii apni shoharat ke dauraan us ek mahatvakanksha ko beshak saakaar kar daalaa he jo mere khyaal se unke dil ke kone main kahin sulag rahi thiah yah mahatvakanksha un cricketron se kahin zyada mashhoor hone kii he, jinhen unhone ipiel shuru karke itnaa dhani bana diya he
 They have not hurt friends and enemies together just because they are fools
 aatmghaatee to ve bilkul nahin hai
 There are three reasons for this
 pehali baat, ve bharat kii siyasat ko bilkul nahin samajhate or uski parvaah bhi nahin karte
 Secondly, all their decisions stem from their ego
 teesraa or sabase ahm kaaran vah cheez he jiske bare main ve kuch nahin kar sakate? vah bisisiai he, jo bhartiya cricket ke shairdharakon kii ek jebi company he
 If i were a modern commentator rather than an old-fashioned journalist, i wanted this company to be under the occupation of the mafia
 aisa isliye nahin ki yah sanstha koi aparaadhiyon, thagon yaa uthaigiron kaa samooh he
 It has indeed done much good for Indian and world cricket
 main to sirf iske kahin zyada kukhyat sanskaran fifa se sabak le rahaa hum, jahaan mafia kaa raaj chalata haih khaskar omerta kaa prakaran hamen yaad dilaataa he ki yahaan kisi bhi baagi ko barbar tareeke se khatm kar diya jaataa he
 This is a cycle of Kali Yuga
 ise tod paanaa mushkil he
 Even if broke, it is impossible to come out safely, provided Lalit proves himself to be an exception
 bisisiai kii siyasat kahin zyada jatil he, yaa kahen aasaan he
 It depends on which angle you are looking at it
 ise bhartiya raajnneeti kaa vah gun itnaa jatil banaata he jahaan sirf dhadon main banty raajnneeti hi kargar hoti he

 i could not find a better issue than politics to arouse the interest of the audience
 yah baat 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle kii he, isliye maine kaha ki chunaav ke parinaam ke bare main koi faisla dene kii morrkhtaa to main nahin karuunga lekin itnaa jarur kah saktaa hum ki agar endie kii jeet hui to rajeev shukla hi ipiel ke pramukh honge
 If Congress wins, Arun Jaitley will come to this post
 har koi is par hansaa or shukla yaa jetali main se kisi ne bhi koi shikayati tippanee nahin kii
 The political power in cricket has been very beneficial for him
 jahaan tak paise kii baat he to ipiel se kaaphi pehle hi cricket main paryaapt paisa aana shuru ho gaya tha
 This is the only game in which no government challenge can be faced, whether it is visa issue, sanctioning, land allocation for stadiums or the issue of policing (except once in 2009 as Home Minister P

 chidambaram ne ipiel ko dakshin africa kaa rasta dikhaa diya tha kyonki vah aam chunaav ke saath pad rahaa tha)
 Even Indian Air Force chartered aircraft or domestic commercial flights are arranged to carry the equipment of broadcasters
 chaahe unka samay badalanaa pade yaa phir atirikt udaanen jodphi pad jaaen
 Cricket has become a sport in India in which the people who occupy the game have built stadiums in their own name and they too won their live (wankhede, D
 vaai
 Patil, M
 e
 Chidambaram, Sahara, Sharad Pawar) whereas there is no one from the nehru-gandhi family whom we are used to seeing
 siyasatdanon kii najar padane se pehle cricket kaa rajkaaj chalaane vaale ve rais or shahi log the jo is khel se muhabbat karte the
 Among them Raj Singh Dungarpur was the last person because we consider the Scindia Gharana not a royal, but a political clan
 iske baad chartered accountenton kaa daur aayaa, jinke bich bisisiai par raaj karne vaale aakhri logon main jagmohan daalamia or shashaank manohar rahe
 Both are still present and Dalmiya has got a resurrection as he compromised with the same ruling class against whom Lalit is fighting today and who had ever ruined him and even a criminal embezzlement case against him Was also registered
 kuchhek naukarshah bhi aae or unhen baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya
 Among them were Ail's former aide and IAS officer from Punjab

 Bindra was one
 cricket kii siyasat kii is badalati hui tasviir main iske baad ek or dilachasp samooh kaa pravesh hua
 Some medium-sized but well-paid corporate sports entered the game in search of love and glamor
 inamen sabase ahm shrinivasana or lalit the
 Both were inherited by REC but both belonged to old type of businesses - cement and cigarettes
 sabase dilachasp baat yah he ki pehle sie ke bich takaraav hua (manohar or daalamia)
 After that there was a quarrel among the businessmen (lalit and Srinivasan)
 is dauraan jo rajnatik ghatak tha, vah bina hile-dule barkaraar rahaa or donon hi baar jis paksh ko usne samarthan diya, uski jeet hui
 Lalit is stubbornly accepting the fact that all politicians within BCCI stand together and always win
 main lalit ko kitna jaanata hum? zyada nahin, sivaae iske ki maine ek baar firozshah kotla main camere par baatcheet kii thi, jab ve ipiel kii pehali kamyaabi se chamak rahe the
 i introduced him to Jerry Maguire of Indian Games (an American sports agent played by Tom Cruise), on whom he was greatly moved
 unhone us baatcheet main vistaar se bataaya tha ki kaise ghanton apane laptop par baithkar unhone ipiel kaa khaakaa taiyaar kiya or is chamatkaar ko saakaar kar daalaa
 Have i met him in London? Of course, that's where an Indian suddenly meets - at the St
 James court of the Taj group
 ve bindra ke saath lunch kar rahe the or mujhe aisa laga ki vahaan mujhe paakar donon main se koi bhi bahut khush nahin tha
 The success of IPL and the strength of the BCCI began to raise their heads and there was a time when they spread their legs out of their sheets
 unhone is vaishvik takat kii khuraaq tabhi chakh lee thi jab unhen pehle ipiel main khilne ke liye australian khilaadiyon ke saath sauda pataane kii khatir bisisiai kii ore se bheja gaya tha
 His influence and greed of cricketers and his money to the Australian Board (a fraction of the players' fees) later helped settle the "monkeygate" dispute of Harbhajan singh-andrew Symonds in Australia
 unki aakraamakata, akad or bisisiai kii takat ke nagn pradarshan ne palade ko bharat ke paksh main jhukaa diya, jisamen ek ampire (steve baknar) ko nilambit kiya gaya jabaki bhajji saste main chhot gaye
 This intoxication of strength turned into an expulsion when in 2009, he cheated the UPA government and took the IPL to South Africa with the connivance of Sharad Pawar and Rajiv Shukla
 us ipiel kaa sabase bada sitara lalit the
 i became witness to this new fame in Davos when i was asked by several inches tall Miss South Africa, looking at the badge of my name, that you are from India, do you know Lalit? This was soon after the 2009 IPL in South Africa
 iske baad lalit kaa patan shuru ho gaya or shrinivasana kaa sitara chamakane laga
 As flamboyant as Lalit was in his style, Srinivasan was as quiet, but he was far smarter in dealing with leaders than one - Jayalalithaa in her own state
 khud lalit kii bindaas or beparwaah style ne unki or madad kii kyonki iske chalate dost or dushman donon hi unase jalane lage the
 Pawar, who remained his friend till now, also could not help Lalit
 unke khilaaf pravartan nideshaalay kaa maamla chaahe jo ho, lekin lalit ke khilaaf aaj sari takatein ek hai
 They may praise Modi, thank Raje and Swaraj, but they will keep distance from them
 narendra modi kii sarkaar ne unhen baar-baar bhagoda kaha he (jo ve nahin hai) or unke “bhaagane” main upie sarkaar ko dosha diya he
 The government may pressurize the British government to extradite them with the help of criminal transaction laws
 lalit kaa durbhaagya yah he ki sari siyasat unke khilaaf ekajute hi rahegi
 There is an old saying that only during cricket and war, Indians become one
 iskaa nayaa sanskaran yah he ki cricket kii satta par chhidi jang main hi saare bhartiya rajaneta ek hote hai
 Had a great Tabla session with My Nephew Sparsh Sangam !! We just love n live music # music # classical music # tablaa post shared by Yo Yo Honey Singh (@yyhsofficial) on Apr 9, 2018 at 9:17 am PDTA post shared by Yo Yo Honey Singh (@yyhsofficial) on Mar 15, 2018 at 2:59 am PDT dilli vidhansabha chunaav main lagbhag sabhi opinian pole meservind kejariwal kii aam aadmi (AAP) party ko bahumtamiltaa dikh rahaa he
 Only India tv-sevator's opinion poll gives a majority to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 india today group or sisero ke opinian pole ke mutabik, AAP 38 se 46 siten jitkar spasht bahumat leti najar aa rahi he
 At the same time, BJP seems to get only 19 to 25 seats
 vahiin india tivi-sivotor ke survey ke mutabik, bijepi ko 37, AAP ko 28 or congress ko 5 siten mil sakati hai
 However, according to ABP news-nielsen, AAP may get 35 seats, BJP 29 and Congress 6 seats
 achti-sifor ke opinian pole main AAP ko 36-41, bijepi ko 27-32 or congress ko 2 se 7 siten di gai hai
 At the same time, according to ET-TNS, AAP can get 36-40 seats, BJP 28-32 and Congress 2 to 4 seats
 vot par tikaa loktantr kya iviem par ja tikaa he or vipaksh ko lagane laga he ki iviem par tike voting se khatra loktantr kaa he
 So on April 10, 13 political parties, including the Congress, knocked on the President's door on April 12, saying that voting should be again on the ballot papers as they do not trust evms
 sawaal bada he ki kya vaaki iviem ke jariye loktantr par hi khatra mandara rahaa he yaa phir haar ke baad vipaksh ko lagane laga he ki votaron kaa bharosa rakhte hue iviem par hi bharosa naa rakhaa jaae
 Before the EVM game, it is necessary to understand the mood of democracy in the country that comes only through evms over the leaders of political representation in the right country, because India is the largest democratic country in the world and according to the census of 2011, Alam It is that
 
 
 - ek saansad 22,20,538 logon kii numaayindagi karata he
 - India is followed by America, the oldest democratic country in the world
 - america main ek cinitor 7,22,636 logon kii numaayindagi karata he
 If you mention China, the world's most populous country in this game of democracy, then you will be surprised to know that
 
 
 - china main neshnal pipuls congress kaa ek sadsy 4,48,518 logon kii numaayindagi karata hai
 - The National People's Congress in China has 2987 members while India has only 545 mps
 bharat ke saansadon par duniya ke kisi bhi pratinidhitiv ke mukaable zyada jimmedaari hoti he to saansad zyada taqatvar bhi hota he or sattadhari party ke haath main takat bhi sabase zyada hoti he
 When this whole process of democracy rests on voting and the method of voting is EVM machine
 sawaal usee par uth rahe hai to bhi masalaa sirf takanic kaa he yaa loktantr kaa, nai bahes isko lekar shuru ho gai he
 Since UP election results are somewhere in the center of the debate and UP is not only the biggest state of the country but it is also the truth of up's electoral democracy
 
 
 - upi main ek vidhayak kareeb 5 lakh logon kii numaayindagi karata he
 - UP is seen as a political laboratory of religions
 - upi kii saamaajik aarthik paribhaasha bhi pashchim se purv jate-jate badal jaati he
 In such a situation, all the political parties who have lost the bumper victory of the BJP are not in a position to digest and the whole debate is based on the fact that the democracy of vote cannot be left out on the basis of EVM

 But amidst these sharp remarks, the Election Commission also challenged it saying that
 
 
 - may main tamaam raajnneetik dalon ke pratinidhiyon ko bulaayaa jayega, or unase apane aarope sabit karne ko kaha jayega
 - Technical experts team will also come from Bangalore and Hyderabad, where evms are made
 - iviem ko hack karne kaa daawa karne vaala koi nijee shaks bhi kaarykram ke liye registration kara saktaa he
 That is, the Election Commission is challenging to prove every allegation
 vahiin samoochaa vipaksh aaj raashtrapati ke daravaaje par dastak dekar niklaa to ek swar main kaha-iviem se chhedchhad ne puri chunavi prakriya kii pavitrataa par sawaal khadey kiye hai, or ye loktantr ke liye khatra he
 But the truth is also that the Congress led by the opposition came to meet the President
 usee congress ke netaa or purv kanoon mantri virappa moili ne yah kehete hue congress ko baikfoot par dhakel diya he ki iviem se gadbady naammumkin he or gadabadi ke aaropon ke jariye congress samet tamaam partiyaan haar ke bahaane talash rahi hai
 However, the question is not about anyone's statement or allegation - the question is about the credibility of evms, because the entire electoral democracy now depends on evms

 Union Minister and bjp's firebrand leader Giriraj Singh (giriraj Singh) has been fielded by BJP this time from Begusarai seat
 magar khabar he ki giriraaj singh begusarai se nahin, navada se hi chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai
 BJP has announced all its candidates in Bihar for the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 isi kram main bijepi ne giriraaj singh ko navada seat kii jagah bihar ke begusarai se tikat diya he
 Giriraj Singh was initially reluctant to fight Begusarai in the murky tongue, but now he is openly speaking against the state unit of BJP and he says that nobody even asked him before confirming the Begusarai seat
 samachar agency ANI se navada ke saansad or bijepi netaa giriraaj singh ne kaha ki 'mere atmasamman ko thes pahunchihai kyonki bihar main kisi bhi saansad kii seat nahin badali gai he
 Giriraj Singh said that it was decided without asking me
 bihar bijepi netritv ko mujhe bataanaa chahie ki aisa kyon kiya gaya
 i have no problem with Begusarai
 magar main apane aatm sammaan ke saath samjhauta nahin kar saktaa
 'giriraj Singh, BJP: My self respect is hurt that no other mp's seat was changed in Bihar
 It was decided without talking to me
 State BJP leadership should tell me why it was done I've nothing against Begusarai but i can't compromise with my self respect
 # loksabhaelection2019pic

 com / g7ld6k3myf Actually, since the BJP decided Giriraj Singh's name from Begusarai, since then, he has been continuously trying to get his name fixed for Nawada somehow
 begusarai se apni ummidavaari se naaraaz giriraaj singh lagaataar media main bayaan de rahe hai ki nawata seat se unka tikat kaat kar begusarai sthantarit kiya janaa unke swabhimaan ko thes pahunchane samaan he
 Giriraj Singh blames the BJP leadership for this
 sutron kii maane to giriraaj singh is vishad par kendriya netritv se baatcheet karnaa chaahate hai or vah chaahate hai ki kisi tarah unhen phir se navada seat se hi ladvaya jaae
 This is the reason why they have not even started electoral preparations from Begusarai
 haalanki, khabar yah bhi he ki bijepi ne jo siten tay kar di he, usase ab vah peeche nahin hatane vaali he or ab giriraaj singh ko manaane kii koshish bhi bijepi nahin kar rahi he
 That is, now Giriraj Singh will have to fight from Begusarai itself

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator An example of how technology can put wings in an artist's dream can be seen in Ramesh Dubey, living in Parsa Mahesi, a very backward village in the Colonelganj area of gonda district
 gramin anchalon kii baton ko vyangy ke jariye logon ke bich pesh karne ke liye ramesh apana utyub channel shuru karnaa chaahate the
 But the backwardness of the village was coming in the way
 gaanv main bamushkil thri-ji mobile signal pakadta tha jisase koi video utyub par post karnaa sambhav nahin tha
 "in April last year, a four-g mobile tower was installed near our village," says Ramesh
 four-ji mobile signal milane se film banaakar soshal media par bhejnaa or risive karnaa aasaan ho gaya he
 After this, Ramesh registered his own Unnati Films House youtube channel in the name of his elder daughter
 ramesh ne pehla video bhaiya lotat he naam se 6 july, 2018 ko jari kiya, jisamen ek saas apni bahu ke bhai se samvaad karke shaadi main dahej puraa na die jane kii shikaayat karti he
 In this Awadhi language video, Ramesh acted as both mother-in-law and daughter-in-law's brother
 bhaiya lotat he video soshal media par viral ho gaya
 Making Ramesh the character of the village people, Ramesh introduced the Awadhi rural environment to the people through the film
 in filmon ke paatr nihoran chachee, lutaavan chachaa, kanhau laal chachaa, jhinakan, nanga misir aaj puure avadhi belt main lokapriy ho gaye hai
 The special thing is that most of the two persons in Ramesh's films have a satirical dialogue in Awadhi language in which the message of redressal of problems and evils in society is hidden
 ramesh bataate hai, ''main apni filmon main hu-ba-hu gramin parivesh ko utaarata hum
 My motive is not just to make people laugh
 hansaane ke saath ham aapako kuch aisi sikh de den jise aap umr bhar yaad rakhen
 Ramesh hails from a very poor family
 inke pita shesh narayan dube lakhanu ke ek mandir main pujari hai
 Ramesh used to imitate the elders of the village right from childhood
 karnalganj ke kanhaiyalaal inter college se intermediat kii pariksha uteern karne ke baad 2007 main ramesh ne lakhanu kii bhaaratendu natya academy se nirdesan kaa paathyakram puraa kiya
 Subsequently, in collaboration with the Health Department, street plays were organized in several cities of Uttar Pradesh to spread awareness about polio
 lakhanu ke yaayavar rangamandal se judakar kai naatakon main bhi abhinay kiya
 "I used to feel that while doing the play, Awadhi language was left behind compared to other languages," says Ramesh
 main apni bhashaa ke liye kuch karnaa chahta tha lekin paisa na hone ke kaaran chup baith jaataa tha
 In 2010, Ramesh joined an orchestra party to earn some money
 ve bollywood kalakaaron kii awaajen nikaal kar mimicri karte the
 Ramesh takes out the voices of almost all Bollywood artists
 pichley saal july se ramesh puri tarah se khud ke utyub channel ke prati samarpit ho chuke hai
 During the last one year and three months, 125 movies have been released on Ramesh's youtube channel
 in sabhi filmon ne ramesh ko avadhi ke safal kamedian ke taur par sthapit kar diya he
 His popularity can be gauged from the fact that his youtube channel, which started a year and a half ago, has got more than 1
5 lakh subscribers
 ramesh celebrity ban chuke hai or uttar pradesh ke purvanchal ilaake main yojit hone vaale kamedi sho main ab inaki sabase zyada demand rahati he
 Difficulty in posting videos on youtube due to backwardness of Sanghargaon
 Posting videos on youtube channel named Bhaiya Lotat Hai in 2018, Ramesh's films are regularly watched by more than four lakh people after release on youtube channel
 The formula of success in the sutra itself is the factor of popularity

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pichley saal jab 13wein sanshodhan ko “jaldi or puri tarah se lagu karne” kii apil kii to srilanka ke tatkaaleen raashtrapati mahinda rajpakshe ko jor kaa jhatka laga tha
 In his first meeting with Rajapaksa, Modi said that this amendment, which is part of the indo-sri Lanka Agreement in 1987, gives police and land rights to provincial councils and will contribute to the work of national reconciliation
 bharat 2009 main grihayuddh khatm hone ke baad se hi yah baat doharaata aayaa he, lekin rajpakshe ko ummid nahin thi ki modi sarkaar bhi ise doharayegi
 This was followed by a visit to the six-member Tamil National Alliance Party, which had control of the Northern Provincial Council in August last year
 nai dilli sthit institute of dephence studies and analysis kii smriti patnayak kahati hai, “rajpakshe kii pratikriya ke rup main phir se china kaa card khelnaa tha
 When the Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Colombo and visited New Delhi in October last year, when the Chinese submarines were allowed to anchor for the second time, there was a distraction in the South Block
 bharat kii ore se srilanka ke vipaksh ko samarthan diya jane laga
 However, New Delhi tried to show itself publicly in the January 8 election
 agle din chunaav main aitihaasik jeet ke turant baad modi ne raashtrapati maitripal sirisena ko bharat aane kaa nyauta bhej diya, jo rajpakshe ke shashan main kharaab ho chuke sambandhon ko phir se majboot karne ke maukey kaa saaf sanket tha
 Sirisena has promised "equal relations with China, India, Pakistan and Japan"
 yah saaf bataata he ki ve china kii ore jhukaav vaale pehle ke rukh ko ab santulit karnaa chaahate hai
 But there will be a lot of pressure on him to address the concerns of New Delhi, such as the inclusion of Tamils from the war-torn northern and eastern areas in Sri Lanka's mainstream
 srilanka ne 25 varshon main uttari ilaakon main prantiy parishad kaa pehla chunaav karaayaa, lekin police or jameen ke maamle main use koi adhikaar nahin diya gaya, jisase unki haisiyat nagarpalikaon jaisi hi rah gai
 India voted against Sri Lanka in 2012 and 2013 on us-backed UN Human Rights Council resolutions
 yuan main bharat ke purv pratinidhi hardip singh puri kehete hai, “sirisena sarkaar ko sabhi samudaayon ko saath lekar chalane kii niti par kaam karne or srilanka ko loktantric va bahu-jaateey samaaj banane kaa apana vaada puraa karne ke liye kuch samay diya janaa chahie

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 se pehle piem modi ke khilaaf sabhi vipakshi dalon ne ekajute hone kii koshish kii or endie kii sambhavit haar ko dekhte hue saal 2014 main bijepi ke saath rahe kai netaaon or dalon ne chunaav se pehle kisi na kisi bahaane paala badal liya
 Now after the Lok Sabha elections are over, till today, after seeing the figures of Axis My India exit poll, it seems that the parties separated from the NDA may have to suffer a huge loss and Prime Minister Narendra Modi can win even bigger than in 2014
 You can enter and return to power again
 aaj tak-exis maai india agsit pole ke mutabik is loksabhaa chunaav main endie ko 542 siton main se 339 se 365 siten milane kaa anumaan he or bijepi ko apane dam par bhi bahumat milane ke asaar dikh rahe hai
 742,187 participants took part in this largest survey till date, whose opinion has been revealed
 endie se alag hone kaa chandrababu naidu ko bhugatna hoga khamiajaegsit pole ke jo aankade saamne aae hai agar wo parinaam main badal jate hai to un partiyon ko nishchit taur par iskaa ghaataa uthaanaa padegaa jo chunaav se thik pehle endie kaa saath chhod kar duusare dalon ke saath gathbandhan kar liya yaa phir vipaksh kaa cheharaa ban gaye
 Talking of leaders and parties who have left the NDA, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) President and Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu comes at the forefront
 andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja nahin milane par tidipi ne endie se naata tod liya tha or chandrababu naidu modi virodh kaa pramukh cheharaa ban gaye
 He roamed several states and tried to unite regional parties against BJP and Narendra Modi and even accused the NDA government of being biased
 beete loksabhaa chunaav main jab tidipi endie gathbandhan kaa hissaa thi to us vakt chandra babu naidu kii party ko 16 siten mili thi lekin is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad agsit pole ke jo aankade saamne aae hai uske mutabik tidipi ko sirf 4 se 6 siten milane kaa hi anumaan he
 Not only this, along with the Lok Sabha elections, the figures of the Assembly elections held in the state have come in the exit poll, it seems that Chandrababu's departure from the power of the state can also be done
 ajtak- exis maai india agsit pole ke mutabik andhra pradesh kii 175 vidhansabha siton main se wiesar congress ko 119-135 siten milti dikh rahi he
 While Chandrababu Naidu's party TDP is getting 39-51 seats
 iske alaava pawan kalyaan kii party jeespi ko 1-3 siten or anya ko 2 siten milane kii sambhaavna he
 Kushwaha and Manjhi may also have to break away from the NDA, this time the equation of Bihar has changed in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 beete chunaav main jo dushman the wo dost ho gaye or jo dost the wo paala badalakar dushman ke khemen main shaamil ho gaye
 We are talking about Bihar's ruling party JDU, Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Loksamata Party and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi's 'hum'
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jahaan jediu bijepi ke khilaaf chunaav ladi thi or mahaj do siton par jeet darj kar pai thi vahiin is baar aaj tak-exis maai india agsit pole ke jo aankade saamne aae hai usamen jediu 17 main se 12 siton par jeet darj karti hui najar aa rahi he
 At the same time, just before the election, Kushwaha left the NDA and joined the grand alliance led by Tejashwi Yadav, if he did not get the required seats
 ab agsit pole ke jo aankade saamne aae hai uske mutabik upendra kushvaha kaa khaataa khulanaa bhi mushkil ho saktaa he
 Similar is the situation of Jitan Ram Manjhi's party and according to the survey it is difficult for him to win any seat
 agsit pole ke mutabik bihar main endie 38-40 siten jeet sakati he jabaki mahagathbandhan 0-2 siten milane kaa anumaan he
 Rajbhar's ministerial post, also difficult to win elections: Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party chief Om Prakash Rajbhar, a BJP ally in UP, rebelled after his party did not get a seat in Uttar Pradesh from NDA and himself from NDA before Lok Sabha elections Is separated
 haalanki iske liye unhone kaaran saamaajik nyaay samiti ke report ko bataaya tha
 After separating from the NDA, the minister also announced to quit
 haalanki agsit pole ke aankade aane ke turant baad siem yogi ne mantri pad se unki chuttee kar di
 According to the data of Aaj tak-axis My India exit poll, Rajbhar's party does not seem to get a single seat in UP
 puure upi main mukhya muqabla bijepi or mahagathbandhan ke bich hota dikh rahaa he
 According to the survey, nda's ally Apna Dal candidates are leading in two seats
 bataa den ki rajbhar kii party suheldev bhartiya samaaj party 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle BJP se judi thi lekin rajbhar bijepi par hamale kaa koi bhi mauka nahin chhodte the
 About a year before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Shiv Sena had also announced that they would contest the next election (2019) alone, but later formed an alliance with the BJP and contested elections under the NDA banner in Maharashtra
 aise hi centre main mantri ram vilaas paswan kii lok janashakti party ke netaa or unke bete chiraag paswan ne sanket die the ki agar unhen manmutabik siten nahin mili to unke liye mahagathbandhan main jane kaa rasta khulaa hua he lekin baad main bijepi se baat ban gai or unki party ne endie ke tale hi chunaav ladaa
 Exit poll figures show that both these parties can also benefit from this election
 bihar vidhansabha chunaav main jeet kaa daawa karte hue rajd supremeo lalu prasad ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki ab jitani siten shesh bachi hai un par vijayi honge
 At an election meeting in dehri-on-son in Rohtas district, Lalu said, 'our RJD LJP alliance will win a huge victory in Bihar assembly elections
 ham sabhi jati birdari ke logon ko saath lekar bihar main sarkaar banaayenge
 He claimed that the upper caste people are saying that the Nitish government has cheated him
 sabhi dharm, jati or birdari ke logon main jadyu bhaajapa sarkaar ke prati aakrosh he or vartmaan sarkaar kaa is baar chunaavon main safaya ho jayega
 Lalu, who came to campaign for the RJD candidate, said that ever since the Congress and Nitish government have come, it has brought downward inflation
 manaregaa main garibon ko kaam tak nahin mil rahaa he
 Lalu said, "when our government comes, inflation will be buried in the ground
" ’purv mukhyamantri ne kaha, ‘sarkaar jhooth kah rahi he ki vikaas hua he
 If there is development, then people are enjoying it
 rajg sarkaar bihar ke liye kulakshan he
 Farmers are not getting water for irrigation on time
 ’unhone kaha ki rajg sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan bahut bhrashtachar hua he
 If his government is formed, all cases of corruption will be investigated
 lalu ne kaha, ‘rajg ke paanch varsh ke kaarykaal ke dauraan bihar main ek bhi kal kaarkaana nahin laga, jabaki centre main rahakar maine rajya ko saat kaarkaane diye
 This includes the proposed railway factory at Dalmiyanagar

 Leader of the Opposition in Delhi Legislative Assembly Vijendra Gupta said that Kejriwal first defied big celebrities by making derogatory statements without any evidence
 maamla jab adaalat main chalaa jaataa he to swayan ko jail jane se bachaane ke liye dillivaasiyon ke tex kaa paisa mukadmaa ladane par kharch karne kii koshish karte hai
 Many big leaders of AAP are under trial

 a petition has been filed in the Supreme Court against the continuous clean chit in Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah in violation of code of conduct
 is yachika par supreme court main buudhvaar ko sunwaayee honi he
 Keeping in mind the possible questions of the Supreme Court, the answers are being prepared in the Election Commission
 ayog ke legal panel ke vakeelon ke saath nirvachan ayog ke aalaa adhikariyon kii meeting ke daur chal rahe hai
 The legal panel has given the Commission officials a list of some possible questions and their answers to the questions that can be asked in the court, like the Gess paper
 lekin ayog ke aalaa adhikariyon ko dar bhi he ki kahin supreme court ne kade sawaal puch liye to kya hoga?nirvachan ayog ne ab tak donon netaaon ko 9 maamalon main clin chit di he
 Let me tell you that there were serious allegations against the two leaders in their election speeches such as the political mention of the military's surgical strike and the use of offensive words against the opponents
 ayog ke sutron ke mutabik nirvachan ayukta ashok lavasa ne meeting ke dauraan aise revadiyon kii tarah banti ja rahi clin chit par aapatti bhi jataai
 But Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora and the newest commissioner Sushil Chandra gave a clean chit to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, ignoring Lavasa's objections
 ayog ke sutara to ye bhi bataate hai ki jila nirvachan adhikari or piem yaa shah kii sabhaaon vaale sambandhit rajya ke mukhya nirvachan adhikari kii report, bhaashan kii recordig or anya sabooton par gaur karne par bhi clin chit dene par ayog ke liye jawaab dena mushkil to hoga
 However, according to the rules of the Election Commission, the jurisdiction and powers of the three commissioners are equal
 kisi bhi mudde par vichaar main matbhed hone par bahumat kaa faisla hi maanya hoga
 Then even if the Chief Election Commissioner is in the minority
 philhal modi-shah clin chit maamle main supreme court ne ayog ke adeshon ko record par rakhane ko kaha he
 After this order, the commission fears that in the next hearing, the court will raise sharp and direct questions on the basis of the procedure and decision of the meeting to be held in the commission
 is maamle main yachikakarta ne ayog ke faislon ko or paardarshee banane ke liye guideline kaa khulaasa karne kii maang kii he
 It is now possible that the Election Commission should inform modi-shah of its decision and process for a clean chit
 nirvachan ayog ab tak aadhikarik taur par sunwaayee ke dauraan teenon ayuktaon ke vichaaron kaa khulaasa nahin karata he
 Only the majority's views are summarized in the media
 lekin ab ho saktaa he court kii tarah hi alpamat vichaar vaale ayukta ke vichaaron kaa bhi media main khulaasa ho

 com / zmqpzvgmib roosi pradhanmantri vladimir putin ne kaha he ki sattadhari united rushiy party ne sansadeey chunaav main acha pradarshan kiya he
 It is to be known that the United Russia Party could get a majority by securing 238 out of 450 seats in the election for Duma (parliament) on 4 December
 chaar varsh pehle party ne 315 siten jitkar do-tihaai bahumat hasil kiya tha
 According to the news agency RIA Novosti, Putin said that 226 votes are needed to pass legislation in Parliament, while United Russia has got 238 seats
 putin ne kaha, 'yah hamen shantipurna tareeke se evam dridhtaa ke saath kaam karne main sakasham banaata he, sthirataa pradaan karata he
 'putin said,' It would not be an exaggeration to say that in recent years, United Russia has served as a strong basis for our political stability
 isliye chunaav main iskaa safal pradarshan keval sarkaar ke liye hi mahatvapurn nahin he, balki puure desh ke liye bhi
 The Communist Party finished second in this election with 92 seats
 iske pradarshan main 2007 ke mukaable 30 pratishat kii vruddhi hui he
 President Dmitry Medvedev has said that the United Russians are ready for an alliance in the New Duma

 The Supreme Court will hear on the transparency of funding to political parties through electoral bonds today
 centre sarkaar ne elactoral bond launch karte vakt daawa kiya tha ki is bond ke jariye political funding main dhaandhlee kam hogi or raajnneetik chande ke rup main milane vaale kaale dhan par roak lagegi, lekin aisa hua nahin
 The Supreme Court reprimanded the Central Government in the hearing held on March 12
 supreme court kaa kahana tha ki centre sarkaar ne political funding par koi sthai system nahin banaaya he
 The Supreme Court had also advised the Center that the Central Government should take serious steps in this regard
 iske baad se hi elactoral bond lagaataar sawaalon ke ghere main he
 In fact, during the hearing of the case in the Supreme Court, the fact came out that the money of public representatives and their relatives increased by 500% within five years
 raajnneetik funding par philhal koi roak-tok nahin he
 Several petitions are pending in the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court to ban such funding
 sarkaar ne raajnneetik dalon ko milane vaali funding ko transparent banane ke liye elactoral bearar bond kii shuruyaat kii thi
 But due to lack of knowledge of the source of donations received by political parties, corporate donations got such a boost
 saath hi videsh se milane vaala dhan bhi vaid ho gaya
 a petition from the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) has been filed against the Electoral Commission's electoral bonds
 jaaniye paanch kaaran jinaki vajah se elactoral bond par hui aapatti--sorcej kaa zikr jaruri nahinvitt mantri arun jetali ne janvari 2018 main likhaa tha ki elactoral bond kii yojana raajnneetik funding kii vyavastha main 'saaf-suthra' dhan laane or 'paardarshita' badhaane ke liye laai gai he
 It was not necessary to disclose the source
 -finance bill 2017 main badlaavelactoral bond finance act 2017 ke tahat kuch badlaav karke laae gaye the
 These changes have also damaged transparency
 janpratinidhitiv kanoon (RP Act) kii dhara 29 si main badlaav karte hue kaha gaya he ki elactoral bond se mili funding ko chunaav ayog kii jaanch ke daayre se baahar rakhaa jayega
 The Election Commission itself objected to these changes and asked the Law Ministry for changes
 chunaav ayog ne kaha tha ki isse yah pataa karnaa mushkil he ki koi raajnneetik dal sarkari videshi strot se chanda le rahi hai yaa nahin
 The imbalance in the funding of the power and opposition parties is really benefiting from the electoral bond
 ADR ke mutabik saal 2017-18 main elactoral bond ke dwaara 222 karod rupee kaa chanda diya gaya tha
 210 crores (94) to BJP
 5%), congress ko 5 karod rupye or baaki dalon ko 7 karod rupye hasil hue hai
 -YYC Norm will get details of Aadhaar and jan-dhan account of people who donate money to political parties through electoral bonds
 elactoral bond main yogadan 'kisi bank ke acount pei check yaa bank khate se electronic clearing system' ke dwaara diya jayega
 In January 2018, while issuing electoral bond notifications, the government had also made it clear that the purchaser would have to fully meet the Know Your Customers (KYC) norm and pay through a bank account
 - shell companiyon ko milegaa badhavacompany act 2013 main kaha gaya tha ki koi company ek vittiya varsh main pichley teen saal ke apane ausat net profit ke 7
 Can not provide political donations of more than 5 percent
 lekin praavdhaan badalte hue funding ko limitales kar diya gaya
 Companies are also exempted from concealing in their books which party they have donated
 chunaav ayog ne is sabhi badlaavon par aapatti kii he
 This has increased the risk of shell companies being formed only to fund political parties

 ’ The Aam Aadmi Party had promised free wifi in the state during the 2015 Delhi Assembly elections, but even after 3 years of its coming to power, this breathtaking plan has not materialized
 ab party adhikariyon or duusare vajahon kaa bahaanaa banane main lagi he
 The scheme of free wifi in Delhi is once again under question
 sarkaar kii ore se peedblyoody vibhaag kowaiphaiyojna lagu karne kii jimmedaari di gai, lekin stoff kii kami or peedblyoody vibhaag ko wifai takanic kii kam jaankaree ne is charchit yojana par philhal brake laga diya he
 The leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party have targeted the officials for the delay in the wifi scheme
 'aap' netaaon ke mutabik wifai yojana lagu hone kii raah aasaan nahin he
 However, the AAP party claims that the party is committed to fulfilling 70 promises and one of them will definitely fulfill the promise of wifi
 2015 main kiya tha vaadaap party ne 2015 main chunavi reliyon ke dauraanfri wiphaiko apane 70 sutri agenda main shaamil kiya tha
 Especially to attract the vote bank of the youth, party leader Arvind Kejriwal kept talking about providing free wifi facility in all the public meetings
 saath hi free vaai-faai kaa elaan dilli ke jantar mantar par '5 saal kejariwal' antham sang ke saath kiya gaya tha
 After coming to power for the second time with a historic 67 seats in February 2015, in March 2015, the Delhi Dialogue Commission sought feedback from Delhiites on how to provide "public wifi" across the state
 iske liye 10 sawaalon kii ek suchi jari karte hue dilli sarkaar ne logon se whatsap helpline number (+ 91 9643327265) yaa i-mail ke madhyam se 200 shabd kii pratikriya bhejne ke liye kaha tha
 To provide free wifi facility in the first phase in 2017, a target of 1,000 hotspots was set in the national capital for which 25 crore was also allocated
 purvi dilli main tender ke alaava march 2018 takwaifidene kaa target rakhaa gaya tha lekin aisa kuch nahin hua
 The Delhi government had then claimed that the government was working on three-four models to provide free wi-fi facility
 saal 2016 june main, aap sarkaar ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki purvi dilli main 500 se adhik sthanon ko disambar 2016 tak hai-speed vaai-faai jone banaaya jayega, lekin yah elaan kabhi hakeekat nahin ban sakaa
 However, recently it was reported that PWD department officials, citing lack of staff, clarified that before this PWD did not work on a technical project like wifi
 sutron kii maane to wifai kaa kaam philhal shuruaati str par hi he or is maamle main kuch khaas pragati lekar kuch khaas kaam aage nahi bad paaya he
 The Delhi government has also proposed a budget of Rs 100 crore for the wifi scheme in the year 2018-19
 adhikariyon ke ravaiye se dereeviphai kii deree par ajtak se baatcheet main aap party ke pravaktaa dilip pandey ne kaha ki wifai kaa kaam lanbaa chaudaa he
 For a long time, all-round action was happening on wifi which is now reaching the logical end
 wifai aam aadmi party kii mahatvakankshi yojana thi
 It should not be thought that there will be no obstruction in this
 unhone aage kaha ki 4 agast ke baad se at bak alji sahab bina kisi javabdehi or jimmedaari ke sarkaar chalaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 On several occasions, decisions were taken against the people of Delhi
 wifai yojana lagu hone kii raah aasaan nahin he
 Although the AAP party is committed to fulfilling 70 promises, wifi will definitely be fulfilled
 unhone adhikariyon ke ravaiye par naaraazgi vyakt karte hue kaha ki dukh kii baat yah he ki jin ejeeniyar adhikariyon kii jimmedaari samaadhaan dene kii he, wo yojana rokane ke liye samasya kaa pahaad khadaa kar rahe hai
 While being an engineer, i was also asked to solve the problem
 adhikari janata ke tex ke paise se selary pate hai unhen janata ke hit main samaadhaan dhundhna chahie
 'AAP' MLA Somnath Bharti said that there is wifi in many cities all over the world
