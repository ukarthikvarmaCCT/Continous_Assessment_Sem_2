 India said it has halted defense exchanges with China over the military's Northern Command commander, Lt
 Gen
 BS Jaswal's refusal to travel to Beijing due to sensitive Jammu and Kashmir command
 nai dilli ne kaha ki china kii karrwai kaa arth he ki vah jammu kashmir kii sthiti par sawaal uthaa rahaa he jo asweekaarya he or is samasya kaa samaadhaan hone tak raksha sambandhi aadan pradaan nilambit rahenge

 Election Commission is constantly being targeted for the question of how reliable Electronic Voting Machines (evms) are
 khaskar vipaksh ise lekar sarkaar or chunaav ayog ke daavon par sawaal khadey kar rahaa he
 However, former Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) TS Krishnamurthy has expressed confidence in the claims of the Election Commission
 jari bahes ke bich purv mukhya chunaav ayukta (siisi) ties krishnamurthi ne kaha ki in mashiinon par puraa bharosa kiya ja saktaa he or vah surakshit bhi hai
 Describing evms as 'pride of the Nation', he said that because of him we can '' save so much paper and time
 ’’ties krishnamurthi ne kaha ki mashine galati nahin karti balki vyakti karte hai
 He said that history is a witness that since the use of evms, all those who have complained about them till now have been from the losing parties
 krishnamurthi ne pitiai ko die ek intervyuu main kaha ki shikaayat karne waalon kaa itihaas uthaakar dekh lijie, vah hameshaa haarane vaale dalon se rahe hai
 Jayalalithaa (late former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu) and Amarinder Singh first went to the Supreme Court
 vahiin agle chunaav main jeetne ke baad vah chup baith gaye
 He said that this time Amarinder Singh came to power (in Punjab) only through evms
 purv siisi se yah puche jane par ki kya iviem main unka bharosa atoot he? is par unhone kaha ki bilkul, jab tak ki koi yah sabit nahin kar detaa ki unamem chhedchhad kii ja sakati he
 He said that as far as i understand from my experience, evms are safe and reliable
 chunaav main kuch iviem main gadabadi kii khabaron par krishnamurthi ne kaha ki mashine galat nahin hoti, galat karne vaale log hote hai
 He said that evms are disturbed because the people who handle their equipment either do not know how to run these machines, or have made any mistake in running or have not been trained properly
 baad main test main un mashiinon main koi gadabadi nahin mili
 In case of disturbances in evms, the Election Commission immediately changed the machines to "increase the confidence and change the outlook of the people" not because there was something wrong with them

 ' Nana has also said that, if Deepika is not ready, she will cast a new girl in her film
 tippaniyan Actually, even though Nana rarely sees Hindi movies, he is greatly influenced by the work of Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra and perhaps this is the reason that the heroine whom Nana has trusted to return to direction is Deepika Padukone
 aapako bataa den kii naanaa patekar maadhuri dikshit ko film prahaar main diarect kar chuke hai
 The film was not much of a success at the box office but it was well received by critics

 Team India's journey in the ICC World Cup-2019 has come to a stop before the goal
 iske saath hi team india ke haath teesri baar world cap dekhne kaa sapana tut gaya
 In the semi-final match, the Indian team was defeated by New Zealand by 18 runs
 is match main behad ghatiya shuruyaat ke baad bharat ne vaapasi kar lee thi, lekin aakhri overon main team phir bikhar gai
 The pair of Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja shared a good partnership for the 7th wicket
 jadeja ke chhakkon ne to darshakon main utsaah kaa sanchaar kar diya tha, lekin pehle jadeja or phir dhoni ke out hote hi team hausala kho baithi
 jadeja-dhoni had raised hopes India lost only six wickets for 92 runs in Wednesday's match
 isi ke saath hi sabakaa dil baith gaya tha
 People felt that the team was now moving towards defeat, but Jadeja and Dhoni had once again raised hopes by adding 116 runs for the seventh wicket
 aisa laga ki agar kuch der tak ye donon batsman tik gaye to bharat ko final main pahunchane se koi nahin roak saktaa he
 Jadeja hit four fours and four sixes in the teambating innings shattered as both were dismissed
 is dauraan aisa lag rahaa tha in donon ballebaajon ke haathon hi bharat ko jeet milegi
 That was when Trent Bolt of New Zealand changed the stance of the match
 unhone 208 ke kul score par jadeja ko captain ken williamsan ke haathon kaich out karvaa diya
 Jadeja faced 59 balls and hit four fours and four sixes
 ab mahendra singh dhoni krij par bharat kii aakhri ummid the
 At this time, India needed 31 runs to win in the last two overs
 dhoni ne pehali gend par chakka maaraa
 The thrill increased again in the stadium
 duusari gend par unhone do ran lene chaahe
 After taking the first run, Dhoni ran for the second run, but he was delayed by a few seconds to reach the crease and he was run out with a direct hit from Martin Guptill
 isi ke saath bharat kii ummiden khatm ho gai
 Tragically Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who came to bat after Antony, was dismissed by New Zealand's Lockie Ferguson
 james nisham ne yujavendra chahal ko 5 ran par out kar bharat kii vaapasi kaa tikat conform kar diya
 Dhoni seen in pressure, certainly could not show the innings expected of Dhoni in this match
 puure match main dhoni ne 72 gendon kaa saamana kiya or 50 ran banaae
 Dhoni was seen in pressure in the match
 kai najuk maukon par phans unase jis shot kii ummid kar rahe the, dhoni use laga nahin sake
 Dhoni's slowness on the cricket pitch overshadowed Team India

 Taking a dig at the government, Anna said, "this government is drunk with power and money
" iske alaava mujhe koi or vajah dikhaai nahin padati
 These people have forgotten the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru
 jis tarah ek sharaabi behoshee kii haalat main ho jaataa he, usee tarah yah sarkaar behosh ho gai he

 congress adhyaksh pad kii jimmedaari sanbhaalane ke baad rahul gandhi kii sabase badi chunauti saamne he
 The date of 12 May has been set for the Karnataka Assembly elections
 karnataka congress shasit kuch chuninda rajyon main sabase bada rajya he
 After these elections, the bugle of 2019 general elections will be played, so it is a big challenge for Rahul Gandhi to save this strong fort of Congress in Karnataka before the general elections
 iskaa andaja isi baat se lagata he ki beete do maheene ke dauraan rahul gandhi chaar baar karnataka kaa daura kar chuke hai
 On his Karnataka tour, Rahul Gandhi is doing a roadshow, meeting students in college and university, getting in touch with the business world and giving his time to the youth brigade along with meeting party functionaries
 in sabhi baithkon main rahul gandhi ke bayanon se saaf he ki in vidhansabha chunaavon ke bahaane unke nishane par kendra kii modi sarkaar he or vah karnataka main bijepi ko ek baar phir maat dekar 2019 main modi sarkaar ke saamne kadi chunauti rakhane kaa rasta saaf karenge
 While talking to businessmen in Karnataka, Rahul Gandhi has challenged the economic policies of the Modi government
 rahul ne daawa kiya he ki endie sarkaar desh main naukari ke sansaadhan paidaa karne main puri taraf se vifal rahi he
 Although Rahul admitted that the pace of creating new jobs was very slow even during the tenure of the UPA government, but according to him, the Modi government has broken all records of failure in this field
 jaane in muddon ke saath-saath rahul ne karnataka daure par kya mudde uthaae:jumala sabit hua lakhon naukariyon kaa waadarahul gandhi ne kaha ki jahaan padosi desh china ek din main 50 hajaar naukariyaan paidaa kar rahaa he vahiin modi sarkaar ek din main mahaj 400 naukariyaan hi de paane main samarth he
 Rahul Gandhi said that the Modi government took charge at a time when the Indian economy was very strong in terms of economic growth, so not being able to create a new job at such a time makes the government's failure more serious
 ise padhein: karnataka kaa siyaasi ganit: congress-bjp main sidhi takkar yaa trishanku?sangh letaa he aarthik faisle?rahul gandhi ne daawa kiya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi apane aarthik faislon ke liye aresas jaisi sansthaaon par nirbhar hai or iskaa khamiyaja desh ko uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 Rahul claimed that on the advice of the RSS, the Modi government decided to ban demonetisation so that a way could be made to turn black money white
 lihaaja, notebandi se sirf desh main kaledhan ko thikaane lagane kaa kaam kiya gaya
 Manmohan's advice not on GST? While terming the Modi government's GST decision once again as Gabbar Singh's tax, Rahul explained to businessmen in Karnataka why he favors GST
 rahul ne daawa kiya ki jiesti lagu hone se pehle congress party kii taraf se purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne vitt mantri arun jetali se baat kii thi
 In this conversation, Manmohan Singh had asked Jaitley to run a pilot project before implementing GST so that new tax rules can be tested
 lekin purv pradhanmantri or arthshaastri singh ke is suzav ko jetali ne nazarandaaj karte hue jawaab diya ki pradhanmantri modi jiesti lagu karne kaa faisla le chuke hai
 Will the Congress government change GST in 2019? Rahul said that the Congress wanted a Tier GST to be implemented across the country with a tax of only 18 per cent and zero GST should be imposed on most products of common man's need
 lekin modi sarkaar ne 5 tear jiesti lagaate hue desh main kaarobaar karnaa behad kathin kar diya
 Rahul promised the businessmen that if the Congress returns to power at the Center in 2019, it can take tough decisions to fix GST
 fail ho gai modi kii videsh niti?rahul gandhi ne modi sarkaar kii videsh niti ko vifal qaraar dete hue kaha ki maujuuda samay main desh kaa sabhi padosi deshon se rishta behad kharaab ho chukaa he
 Whereas the government should have tried to normalize relations with neighboring countries to further strengthen itself globally
 iskaa nateeja aaj hamaare saamne he
 China has succeeded in building a special relationship with all the neighboring countries of the country
 rahul ne kaha ki sarkaar kii vifaltaa kaa andaja is baat se bhi lagata he ki rus jaisaa desh jo hameshaa se bharat kaa sabase kareebi dost rahaa he vah bhi aaj pakistan ke saath majboot rishta banane kii kavayad main safal ho rahaa he
 Why weakened the defense budget? On the defense budget of the central government, Rahul said that today countries like China and Russia, including the US, are doubling and tripling the defense budget
 yah kadam vah antarrashtriya halaat ko dekhte hue uthaa rahe hai
 But India has not acted to strengthen its defense budget, being ignorant of the international environment

 These elections, which are being held exactly halfway through the tenure of the BJP government of the state, will obviously be a measure of the trend of the public towards Yogi Adityanath's government in the state

 - input bhashaa se Preparations for the electoral battle have started in Bihar
 bijepi ne sabase pehle jeethanram maanjhi ko apane paale main kiya, jabaki ramvilas paswan unke saath pehle se hi hai
 In this way, BJP has tried to capture the entire Dalit vote in a way
 isse daliton main bhi ek sandesh jayega
 However, during the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP has done so in Uttar Pradesh
 agadi jatiyon ke saath daliton kaa vot bank ek samay congress ke paas hota tha, magar yah kanshiram ke bahujan samaaj ke udai ke pehle kii baat he
 The BJP also has Kushwaha, which will also dent the lav-kush caste votes
 bihar main kurmi or koiri yani kushvaha jati ko lav-kush jati kaha jaataa he
 Weddings also take place between these two castes and in politics both have been voting together
 lekin upendra kushvaha ne alag dal bana kar in donon jatiyon ke voton ko alag kar diya
 This may be a matter of concern for Nitish Kumar, as till now 8% of the votes of both these castes were held by Nitish Kumar
 yahaan tak ki unhen inase vot maangane kii bhi jarurat nahin padati thi
 On the other side is Pappu Yadav, who dominates the area of koshi, especially in the three districts of Purnia, Saharsa and Madhepura
 supaul seat par unki patni congress se saansad hai or pappu yadav ne apni alag party bana lee he
 In such a situation, a dire situation was created for Ranjitha Ranjan, whether she asked for votes for the husband's party or for the Congress
 yahi vajah he ki bihar chunaav main bijepi kii bhi taiyaari puri he
 He is not nineteen from Lalu, Nitish and Congress alliance from anywhere
 phir uske paas nitish brand ko takkar dene ke liye praadhanmantri modi jaisaa netaa bhi he
 However, here also a weak link of BJP is seen that there is no leader of Nitish's rivalry in Bihar
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi kisi ko mukhyamantri pad kaa daavedaar bana kar chunaav nahin lard sakati he
 The comments ek taraf bihari babu shatrughna sinha munhaphulae baithe hai
 They are not made up of the BJP leaders of Bihar
 saath hi unhen lagata he ki unhen centre main mantri banaaya janaa chahie tha
 They also feel that if they are to remain as mps only, then they can also be made from JDU
 ab dekhnaa he ki bijepi bihar main chunaav prachaar ko kaise sambhalati he
 Modi cabinet has six ministers from Bihar and the bjp's way of campaigning is going to make Bihar election quite interesting
 vaise loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan uttar pradesh main bijepi aisa kar chuki he
 The vote bank of Dalits along with the forward castes was once with the Congress, but this was before the rise of Kanshi Ram's Bahujan society
 bijepi ke paas kushvaha bhi hai, jisase lav-kush jati ke voton main bhi send lagegaa
 The Kurmi and Koiri i
e
 Kushwaha caste in Bihar is called the luv-kush caste
 in donon jatiyon main aapas main shaadiyaan bhi hoti hai or raajnneeti main donon saath-saath hi vot karte rahe hai
 But Upendra Kushwaha separated the votes of these two castes by forming a separate party
 yah nitish kumaar ke liye chintaa kii baat ho sakati he, kyonki abhi tak in donon jatiyon ke 8 fisadi voton par nitish kumaar kaa ecchhatra raaj tha
 Even they did not have to ask for votes from them
 duusari taraf pappu yadav hai, jinka kosi ke ilaake main dabadabaa he khaas kar teen jile purniya, saharsa or madhepura main
 His wife is a Congress MP from Supaul and Pappu Yadav has formed his own party
 aise main ranjita ranjan ke liye dharmsankat vaali sthiti paidaa ho gai ki vah pati kii party ke liye vot maangen yaa congress ke liye
 This is the reason that bjp's preparation is also complete in Bihar elections
 vah kahin se bhi lalu, nitish or congress gathbandhan se unniis nahin he
 Then he also has a leader like Prime Minister Modi to compete with Nitish brand
 haalanki yaheen par bijepi kii ek kamjor kadi bhi dikhti he vah he bihar main nitish ke takkar kaa koi netaa na hona
 This is the reason why BJP cannot contest elections by making someone a contender for the post of Chief Minister
 tippaniyan On one side, Bihari Babu Shatrughan Sinha is sitting on his face
 bihar ke bijepi netaaon se unki banati nahin he
 He also feels that he should have been made a minister at the Center
 unhen yah bhi lagata he ki yadi keval saansad ban kar hi rahanaa he, to vah jediu se bhi bana ja saktaa he
 Now it is to see how BJP handles the election campaign in Bihar
 modi cabinet main bihar se chah mantri hai or bijepi kaa prachaar kaa tarika bihar chunaav ko kaaphi rochak banane vaala he

 Union Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti has responded to Rahul Gandhi's allegations of not cleaning the 'ganges' on PM Narendra Modi
 unhone rahul gandhi par nishaanaa sadhate hue salaah dete hue kaha,''main upi chunaavon ke nattejey aane ke baad rahul gandhi se thailand nahin jane kaa aagrah karongi kyonki nattejey aane ke baad aisi hi sambhaavna he
 They should come with me to see the work of cleaning the Ganges and if the campaign for its cleaning has not started, they should either jump into the Ganges or else i will jump
 '' Not only this, Uma Bharti also targeted Akhilesh Yadav during a conversation with NDTV
 ullekhneey he ki upi chunaavon main sapa-congress gathbandhan he
 In this context, Uma Bharti targeted Akhilesh, saying that his department is engaged in the campaign of cleaning the Ganges, but SP leader and UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav is 'the biggest enemy of Ganga'
 tippaniyan Attacking Akhilesh Yadav, Uma Bharti said, "clean Ganga campaign has started in four out of five states but UP government has ordered NOC (no objection certificate) to all Ganga districts
" 
 
 main is order kii copy de sakati hum
 Along with this, Uma Bharti, in a way of advising Rahul Gandhi, said, "either Rahul Gandhi should get rid of Akhilesh or move away from the coalition itself
" '' It is worth mentioning that recently, during the election campaign in Varanasi, Rahul Gandhi said while targeting PM Narendra Modi, "modi ji says i am the son of UP and Ganga is my mother and mother Ganga has called me from Gujarat 
 
 
 modi ji ganga maa ke paas aae or sauda kiya
 
 
 Ganga Maa first make me Prime Minister and after that i will see everything
 
 
 '' is par uma bharti ne kaha ki yah vastav main rahul gandhi kii 'sankeern soch' ko darshata he
 He said, "not only the people of Gujarat but the people of the whole country call Ganga as mother
 
 
 unki maa rahul gandhi ganga ke bare main behad bhavuk hokar baat karti hai, unako kam se kam rahul ko iske bare main bataanaa chahie
 '' sirf itnaa hi nahin uma bharti ne enditivi se baatcheet ke dauraan akhilesh yadav par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa
 It is worth mentioning that sp-congress alliance is there in UP elections
 is lihaaj se uma bharti ne akhilesh par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki vah unka vibhaag to ganga kii saaf-safai ke abhiyaan main laga he lekin sapa netaa or upi ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav 'ganga ke sabase bade shatru' hai
 The comments uma bharti ne akhilesh yadav par hamalaa bolte hue kaha,''paanch main se chaar rajyon main svachh ganga abhiyaan kaa kaam shuru ho gaya he lekin upi sarkaar ne sabhi ganga jilon ko enosi(anaapatti praaanpatr) nahin dene kaa aadesh diya he
 
 
 i can give a copy of this order
 '' iske saath hi rahul gandhi ko salaah dene ke andaaj main uma bharti ne kaha, ''yaa to rahul gandhi ko akhilesh se peechha chhudaa lenaa chahie yaa khud gathbandhan se dur hat janaa chahie
 '' ullekhneey he ki pichley dinon rahul gandhi ne varanasi main chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan piem narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha tha, ''modi ji kehete hai ki main upi kaa betaa hum or ganga meri maa he or maa ganga ne mujhe gujarat se bulaayaa he
 
 
 Modi ji came to Ganga Maa and made a deal
 
 
 ganga maa pehle mujhe pradhanmantri banaao or uske baad main sab kuch dekhuunga
 
 
 On this, Uma Bharti said that it really reflects the 'narrow thinking' of Rahul Gandhi
 unhone kaha, ''keval gujarat ke log hi nahin balki puure desh ke log ganga ko maa kahkar pukaarte hai
 
 
 His mother Rahul Gandhi talks about Ganga very passionately, he should at least tell Rahul about it

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special news letter madhya railway main lonawala ke paas ek badi rail durghatana railway kii sooyeeboojh se batch gai
 Actually, it happened that a part of the hill suddenly fell on the railway track at night near Monkey Ghat in Lonavala
 uske kuch hi der baad vahaan se sahyadri express guzarane vaale thi, lekin usase pehle hi railway kii teesri aankh yani sisitivi ne pathar girte hue dekh liya or centre ko suchit kar over head vir kii bijli band kar di gai
 According to Sunil Udasi, the chief spokesperson of the Central Railway, last year, due to the problems in that ghat section during the rainy season, the lights on that entire section were increased
 # teesri aankh kaa kamaal !! @central_railway main lonawala ke paas rail durghatana hote hote bachi
 Suddenly a part of the hill fell on the rail track in the ghat
 kuch der baad hi sahyadri express guzarane vaali thi par uske pehle hi railway kii sisitivi main pathar girte dikh gaya @ndtvindiapic

 Whose monitoring is 24 hours
 kal raat jaise hi ghat section main patari par pathar gira to puri ghatana sisitivi camere main kaid ho gai or yah turant monitor par dikhaa
 After this, everyone was alerted

 Yogi government has issued a notice to vacate the famous 'cheroz Hangout' of Lucknow, which is run by acid-infested women
 sarkaar ke is faisle ke baad dedh darjan acid peedit mahilaon ke saamne roji-roti kaa sankat khadaa ho gaya he
 Please tell that through this cafe, acid stricken women were running their livelihood
 saath hi ye sandesh bhi de rahi thim ki acid peedit hone ke baavjood peedit mahilaayein himmat or atmasamman ke saath jindagi ji sakati hai
 Hearing the order to close the cafe on just three days' notice shows the ground reality of Yogi government's claims as well as insensitivity, in which he describes himself as welfare and benevolent for women
 haalanki, court ne maamle main 21 dinon kaa ste diya he
 The café employs girls who have had acid attacks in their lives
 unke chehre in hamalon main jhulas chuke hai
 In such a situation, they are largely separated from the mainstream of society
 ab in ladakiyon kii chintaa ye bhi he ki unka parivaar kaise chalegaa
 Also, even more important is that the way to live by raising the head of his honor is now on the verge of snatching
 is cafe main aane vaale log bhi is baat se dukhi hai
 For the past several years, an organization called Chhaan has been working for acid attack victims
 isi sanstha ko lakhanu ke gomtinagar main is caffeco chalaane kaa jimmaa diya gaya he
 Aaj Tak spoke to the operators and girls of the organization running the Cheroz Hangout, who gave the cafe a distinct identity in the country in the last 3 years
 is cafe ko chalaane vaali sanstha chhaanv ke sanchaalak ashish shukla kehete hai ki sarkaar kaa iraadaa sirf is jameen ko hathiyanna he kyonki yah jameen lakhanu ke sabase shandaar ilaake main sanstha ko di gai thi
 According to Ashish, this cafe was a way for acid victims to live life with respect, but this land was stinging in the eyes of the government and that is why it is being snatched away
 hamaari sanstha ke upar kai tarah ke aarope lagaae gaye hai, lekin hamane sarkaar se kaha ki jaanch kara lijie, lekin jameen chhinana hi unka makasad he
 When Aaj Tak spoke to the head of the project run by the Women's Welfare Corporation on the reasons behind this order, she cited financial irregularities as the reason
 sherose hangout, lakhanu ke logon kaa ek pasandida sthaan ban chukaa tha, jahaan lekhak, patrkaar, kalakaar or rangakarmiyon samet lakhanu aane vaale tourist jarur aate the
 However, it has been claimed by the government that after closing this hangout, these women will be given training at the national level for skill development, so that they can lead a better life
 haalanki, sawaal yah he ki unase ek jindagi chhinakar duusari jindagi ke sapane sarkaar kyon dikhaanaa chaahati hai? Once again, Salman Khan and Yuliya are in the news, but this time the reason for staying in the news is not the marriage of these two but the breakup
 pyaar ke maamle main hameshaa se analki rahe salmaan khan or unki garlfriend ulia kaa brallep ho gaya he
 Yulia herself has confirmed the news of the breakup
 ulia ne romanianmagazine ko die intervyuu main aisa diya he ki wo salmaan se duuri bana chuki hai
 According to the news of a website, Lulia said during the interview that by going to India, i got to learn a lot
 maine hindi main gaanaa shuru kar diya he

 There you will not get much privacy
 vahaan par ek hi ghar main bahut saare log rahete hai
 'julienne also said in the interview that we need to wear clothes accordingly, we have to take care of what kind of clothes to wear on the streets
 baad main mujhe ahsaas hua ki mere kapade vahaan ke hisaab bahut deep cat vaale hai
 But yes i also learned something about India and its languages

 In the Ayodhya case, the Supreme Court has denied early hearing
 saath hi aaj supreme court main bijepi netaa subrahmanyam swami ko bada jhatka laga he
 The court asked Subrahmanyam Swamy directly that you are not a party in this matter, then with what authority are you coming in the middle of the court? Here let us state that Swamy had filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking early settlement of the Ayodhya dispute
 
 aaj is maamle kii sunwaayee karte hue adaalat ne kaha ki maamle ke pakshakaron ko or vakt dene kii jarurat he or court ne maamle kii jald sunwaayee se inkaar kar diya
 Subrahmanyam Swamy took the help of social media site Twitter to make his statement after the shock from the court
 swami ne is maamle par do tawits kiye or kaha ki jo log adaalat main maamle ko latakaana chaah rahe the unhen kamyaabi mili he or wo ram mandir banavaane ke liye duusare raste apanaayenge
 In his first tweet, Swamy wrote, 'today the judge in the court asked me if i am a party in this case, i said that i am saying this under my fundamental right to worship
 ’today the SC asked me if i was a party in the Ayodhya dispute
 i said i had made clear that i was on Fundamental Right to worship issue— Subramanian Swamy (@ Swamy39) March 31, 2017 In his second tweet, he wrote, 'the judges said they had no time and closed the case
 duusare shabdon main kahuun to jo is maamle ko adaalat main latakaana chaah rahe the, safal hue
 I'll go the other way
 ’the judges said they have no time and adjourned the matter
 In other words those who wanted delay succeeded

 According to legal experts, as long as the matter is in court, there are very few other ways to deal with it
 aam aadmi party ne iees adhikariyon par press conference karke jhooth bolne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Delhi Environment Minister Imran Hussain and Transport Minister Kailash Gehlot said that IAS officers are lying
 dilli main iees adhikari hadtaal par hai or mantriyon kii baithak main nahin aa rahe hai, jiske chalate kai yojanaayen rukii hui hai
 The response of these AAP ministers came in response to the press conference of the IAS Association
 darasal, ravivaar ko IAS association ne dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke dharne ke khilaaf press conference kii thi
 At the same time, dismissing Kejriwal's allegations, claimed that IAS officers in Delhi are not on strike
 wo rozaana niyamit rup se daftar aa rahe hai or apana kaam kar rahe hai
 The association said that the officials do not go to the meetings where they do not feel safe
 suraksha or atmasamman sabase pehle aata he or niyam-kaayade baad main
 The morale of the officers has dropped due to the recent dealings with the Chief Secretary
 vahiin, iees association ke aaropon par pratikriya dete hue dilli ke paryaavaran mantri imran hossain ne kaha, 'iees adhikari jhooth bol rahe hai
 If the officials feel that their morale has dropped, then they should attend the meeting of ministers
 jo yojanaayen rukii hai, unhen lagu karen
 'he said,' Today Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia are sitting on the Deputy Governor (LG) House to end the strike of the officials
 alji chuni hui sarkaar ke kaam ko nahin roak sakate hai
 On Friday, i had called a meeting of the Department of Environment, but neither the Secretary nor the Member Secretary came
 main meeting notice kii copy tak dikhaane ko taiyaar hum
 Moreover, Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gehlot said that the allegations of IAS officers are absolutely false
 mantri hi nahin siem kejariwal kii baithkon main bhi iees adhikari nahin aate hai
 'he questioned that if the officials do not come to the meeting, how will the public work? As far as morale is concerned, the matter is going on in the court, but which law is not written in the meeting
 unhone kaha, 'yah kahana niraadhaar or galat he ki saal 2018 main mantriyon main baithak hi nahin bulaai
 What the IAS Association said: Manisha Saxenane of the IAS Association said that the news of the strike of IAS officers in Delhi is absolutely false and baseless
 ham sarkaar kii baithak main shaamil ho rahe hai
 All departments are doing their work
 hamamen se kuch adhikari to chhuttiyon main bhi kaam kar rahe hai
 He said, 'after what happened to the Chief Secretary, we are all afraid
 dar sirf IAS main hi nahin balki har sarkari afasar main he
 All officers and employees maintain a five-minute silence at lunch
 hamaara virodh pradarshan bas itnaa hi he or ham ise jari rakhenge
 He informed that the file for door to door delivery of ration in Delhi is not pending with the IAS
 iees adhikariyon ne mantriyon par lagaae gambhir aropessociation ne press vijyapti jari kar kaha ki rashan kii home step delivery kii file alji ne 20 march 2018 ko siem arvind kejariwal ke paas bheji thi lekin wo fil abhi tak civil supplai vibhaag ke paas nahi pahunchi he
 This proves that IAS officers do not have the file
 iske alaava naalon kii safai ko lekar afasaron ne aarope lagaaya ki is babat saal 2018 main abhi tak mantriyon ne koi baithak nahin kii he or 8 june 2018 ko notice bheja gaya ki 25 june ko is maamle main baithak hogi
 Safety and self-esteem First of all, during this time, the IAS Association also admitted that officers do not attend routine meetings
 association kii ore se kaha gaya, ham jin meeting main sef feel nahin karte vahaan nahin jate hai
 Safety and self-respect comes first, rules and regulations later
 association ke mutabik meeting main jane ke liye mahila iees afasar suraksha maangati hai
 But we cannot go with the security guard given the confidentiality of the meeting
 iees association ne kaha ki meeting main camera laga hone se suraksha kii guarantee nahin mil sakati, soch or vyavhaar badalane kii jarurat he
 After what happened to the Chief Secretary, no one from the government reached us
 mukhyamantri hamaari suraksha sunishchit karen, ye hamaari prarthana he
 IAS officer Varsha Joshi said, 'we are scared and feel aggrieved
 hamen raajnneetik kaarnon se istemaal kiya ja rahaa

 smartphone ke badhate bazaar ke baavjood pehali baar global market main smartphone kii bikri main giravat darj kii gai he
 According to the American research firm Gartner, smartphone sales recorded a first decline in the fourth quarter of 2017
 research form ne kaha he ki top-5 companiyon main 2017 kii chauthi timahi main sirf huaave or shaomi hi aisi companiyaan hai, jinamein growth darj kii gai he
 Global smartphone sales as of the fourth quarter of 2017 stood at 408 million units, up from the fourth quarter of 2016 of about 5
 6 fisadi kam he
 The most important thing is that since 2004, Gartner has been tracking global smartphone sales and since then, for the first time ever, smartphone sales have decreased in the global market
 gartner ke research diarector anshul gupta ne kaha he, ‘2017 main bikrimen giravat kii do mukhya vajahen rahi hai
 The first reason is that instead of buying more cheap smartphones, people are buying only feature phones of good quality
 ’gartner ke mutabik smartphone cell main kami aane kii duusari vajah ye he ki yugers riplacement smartphone ke taur par quality model le rahe hai or use zyada samay tak ke liye rakh rahe hai jo smartphone ke riplacement saaikal ko bhi badha rahaa he
 Demand for smartphones with 4G connectivity and better camera features is still high
 riplacement ke dauraan kuch phaayde ki vajah se bhi isamen giravat darj kii gai he
 In spite of the decrease in global sales, South Korean company Samsung ranked number-1 in the fourth quarter of 2017 with more than 18 percent market share

 There has been a 6 per cent decline, but despite this the company remained No

 The state government has taken tough measures against people forcibly converting in Jharkhand
 soobe kii sarkaar ne mangalvaar ko state cabinet ne freedom of riligian bill par apni sahmati de di he
 Under this, a person who commits forcible conversion can be punished with imprisonment up to 3 years or a fine of Rs 50,000 or both
 iske alaava saath hi yadi yah aparaadh naaballig, mahila, anusuchit jati yaa anusuchit janajati ke vyakti ke prati kiya gaya to sajaa teen kii bajaae 4 saal kii or jurmaana bhi badhaakar ek lakh rupee tak dena hoga
 Cabinet Secretary SS Meena told that before any person can do this, the deputy commissioner of the district has to give it in writing
 iske alaava puraa vivaran bhi dena hoga ki kab, kaise or kis tarah ke aayojan main dharm parivartan karaayaa jayega
 The Bharatiya Janata Party, while welcoming the Freedom of Religion Bill 2017 prohibiting conversion, said that forced conversion is an anti-national activity and should be stopped at all costs
 jharkhand pradesh bhartiya janata party ke mahaamantri sah mukhyalay prabharee deepak prakaash ne kaha ki party aaj rajya mantrimandal dwaara sweekrut nae dharmantaran nirodhi vidheyak kaa swaagat karti he, kyonki isse raashtra or visheshkar adivasee samskruti kii raksha ho sakegi
 He said that there has been a history of conversion in Jharkhand in the past due to the widespread inducement and coercion of the tribals and the exploited, in view of which there was a need for such a law for a long time
 gauratlab he ki jharkhand main dharm parivartan kaaphi vivaadaaspad mudda rahaa he
 This can be gauged from the fact that last year, Chief Minister Raghuvar Das directly attributed the conversion to Christian missionaries

 The Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) efforts to form a consensus in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) for the presidential election have received a major setback, as sources said that the NDA ally Shiv Sena on giving Prime Minister Narendra Modi the right to choose the presidential candidate
 Has expressed disagreement
 isi kavayad ko lekar ravivaar subah 10 baje ke baad bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ke awaas 'matoshri' pahunche, jahaan sava ghante tak unki baithak chali
 The meeting was attended by the Shiv Sena chief along with his son Aditya, while Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Maharashtra state president Raosaheb Danve joined Amit Shah
 tippaniyan In the meeting, it was proposed by the BJP that the right to choose a candidate for the presidential election has been given to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the NDA, so the Shiv Sena should also support it
 gyaat ho ki shivasena apni taraf se bina puche pehle sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat or baad main krishi vaigyanik emes swaminathan ke naamon ko aage kar chuki he
 The bjp's exercise was that the Shiv Sena should maintain the discipline of the NDA instead of suggesting names
 sutara bataa rahe hai ki shivasena ne is prastaav ko asweekaar kiya he
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has made it clear how BJP is expecting support from Shiv Sena without naming its candidate
 thakare kaa tark he ki vah apane taraf se do naamon kii ghoshnaa kar chuke hai, so, bijepi ko un par pratikriya deni hogi
 If the name is to be decided then the NDA will decide, not just Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 aise main baithak khatm kar khaali haath lautne ke sivaay bijepi netaaon ke paas koi or chaara nahin tha
 With this exercise, BJP national president Amit Shah reached Shivaji chief Uddhav Thackeray's residence 'matoshree' after 10 am on Sunday, where his meeting lasted for a quarter of an hour
 baithak main shivasena pramukh apane bete aditya samet shariq hue, jabaki amit shah kaa saath dene maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis or maharashtra pradeshdhyaksh ravsahab daanve shaamil hue

 It is to be known that Shiv Sena has put forward the names of Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat and later agricultural scientist MS Swaminathan without asking his side
 bijepi kii kavayad thi ki shivasena naamon ko sujhane ke bajaay endie kaa anushaasan banaae rakhe
 Sources are saying that Shiv Sena has rejected this proposal
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne spasht kar diya he ki bijepi apane ummidavaar kaa naam bina bataae shivasena se samarthan kii apeksha kaise kar rahi he
 Thackeray argues that he has announced two names on his behalf, so the BJP will have to react to them
 agar naam tay karnaa he to endie tay karegaa, keval pradhanmantri narendra modi nahin
 In such a situation, the BJP leaders had no choice but to finish the meeting empty handed

 This central theme, described in the words of India Today Group Chairman and editor-in-chief Arun Puri, was repeated in debates and discussions in 22 interesting and vigorous sessions of India Today Conclave East in Kolkata on 5 and 6 October
 The bar emerged
 meghalaya, manipur, tripura or arunachal pradesh ke mukhyamantri, sheersh raajnneetik, udyogpati, khel sitare, filmkaar, adaakaar or sangeetkaar, ve sab vahaan the or unhone bataaya ki hindustan kaa unka vichaar kya he or ise banane main ve khud apni bhoomika ko kis tarah dekhte hai
 The conclave started in a very inspiring manner when three women player icons — Asian Heptathlon gold medalist Swapna Burman, former Indian women's cricket team captain Jhulan Goswami and Indian women's hockey team captain Rani Rampal - displayed passion, passion and bravery
 Told unbelievable stories and recalled the "golden moments" of his visit to the summit
 burman ne kaha, "main to vahi hum jo pehle thi, bas log hi ab mujhe alahada dhang se dekhne lage hai
 The stage of the conclave with the song 'skyfall' of Adal playing in the leader's background ahead of politics turned into an unmistakable ground for the battle of 2019 when rhetoric of rhetoric started taking place among the political parties
 "bengal tiger or 2019: kya yah dahaadega?''sheershak satr main bhaajapa kii rajyasabha saansad roopa ganguli ne jor-shor se bataaya ki rajya main badhati sampradayikta unki party kii galatiyon kii vajah se nahin balki mamata banerjee kii hukumat main kanoon or vyavastha kii girti haalat kaa nateeja he
 The Left was represented by Lok Sabha MP Mohammad Salim, who countered the plea by stating that "religion has been politicized only after Modi and Mamata came to power
" ''saleem ne ganguli se poocha, "puja-ibaadat kii jagahon par to dharm thik he, par aap ise sadakon par kyon laa rahe hai?'' vam saasand ne aarope lagaaya ki mamata "aresas kii mahanatam ijad'' hai or unhone vamapanthiyon ko satta se baahar karne ke liye isaki madad lee thi
 He also said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mamta are fighting "mock WWF"
 ''to kya vampanth ab rajya main apraasangik ho chukaa he? makapa kii purv saansad malini bhattacharya kii raay main sab kuch khatm nahin hua he
 Accusing BJP and Trinamool Congress of indulging in "open competition and behind-the-scenes collusion" in the title session titled "competitive Communalism — Fire or fake riots on the streets", he said "just because we are not in power, This does not mean that the party has become irrelevant
 hamaari ladaai bhay or bhedbhaav kii siyasat ke liye nahin balki sahi or vaazib kii siyasat ke liye he
 Garga Chatterjee, assistant professor at the Indian Statistical Institute, said that if there has been any change in the political equation of Bengal, it is the BJP and therefore it has to be blamed for the communal violence in the state
 chatarji ne kaha, "chunki falak par ek hi nayaa kirdaar bhaajapa he, isliye vahi isaki vajah he
 "state vice-president of BJP Jayaprakash Majumdar attacked Trinamool for bogus talk," When communal violence takes place in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, Mamata Banerjee accuses BJP governments of these states, but when violence takes place in Bengal So she accuses them of bringing outside influences, especially BJP outsiders
 sarkaar or mukhyamantri ko jawaab dena chahie
 Sessions with the theme "" Left or South: Where will Bengal bow? "and" Saffron tide and the great hope of the east - what will happen next "
 tiemasi main nae aae patrkaar chandan mitra ne sweekaar kiya ki "jo log trinmul ke saath nahin janaa chaahate, unke liye bhaajapa hi vikalp he'' par ve yah maanane ko taiyaar nahin the ki banerjee kii lokapriyata main giravat ai he or bhaajapa bengal kii 42 loksabhaa siton main se aadhi se zyada par kabja kar legi, jaisaa ki kabhi tiemasi main duusare number ke netaa rahe or ab rajya main bhaajapa ke chunavi ranneetikaar mukul roy ne daawa kiya

 unhone "nepathy main bahumat kii jod-tod karne'' ke liye bhaajapa par hamalaa bolaa, to hemanth biswa sarama ne iskaa turshi-ba-turshi jawaab diyah "jab congress gathbandhan karti he to yah khalis sona hota he or jab bhaajapa aisa karti he to yah jod-tod he
 "the Congress, TMC and all the left-wing speakers emphasized that" there will be a battle of ideology in 2019 "and in a chorus that everyone needs to come together on one platform of ideology to" stop the saffron tide " 
 centre main baari udyog rajyamantri babul supriyo ne "purab kii viraat ummidah aage kya hoga?'' vishay par kaha ki bhaajapa "mamata banerjee kii sada jivan or hinsak vichaar kii vichaardhaara'' ke khilaaf bhi ladaai lard rahi he
 Referring to a dialogue of Ram Gopal Varma's 2015 film Sarkar, he said that "if you have to defeat the government, first it has to destroy its ideology
" '' unhone yah bhi kaha ki bengal main tiemasi kii kutil vichaardhaara ko benakaab karne kaa vakt ab aa gaya he
 Here, when the BJP, the Left and the Congress were tearing apart Mamata Banerjee's "best Bengal" (mukesh Ambani's coined phrase) by referring to the "chaotic state of law and order" and calling it "100 per cent extortionist"
 "(or as Ganguly alleged), then on the other hand, the business community ie investor companies said that they are still ready to" play big bets for Bengal "

 Mitra further clarified the point, "in 2009, Mamata supported GST for the protection of msmes because these micro small and medium industries created the most jobs and they were given 20 different taxes and Inspector Raj Was facing par ab emsamai ko varking capital na hone ke kaaran dushwariyaan jhelni pad rahi hai
 When asked if Mamata would be the consensus choice for the Prime Minister, Mitra, who has always been her trusted lieutenant, said that "she is not interested in this chair" and she fights for the cause
 unhone kaha, "agar hindustan aaj rasaatal main chalaa jaae or bhartiya arthvyavastha dharashayi ho jaae, to ve ise bachaane ke makasad se (pradhanmantri kii jimmedaari) sweekaar kar lengi

 par hindustan ko bhi unki pahchaan sabit kerani hogi
 He also said, "hindustan has never raised the issue of illegal migrants in the last 10 years, but there may come a time when both countries will discuss this

 cheteshwar pujaara kaa kahana he, "main chintit nahin hum, kai baar aapako bade shatak naa dekhakar ye dekhnaa chahie ki aap team kii jeet main yogadan de rahe hai ki nahin
 i think i am batting well
 pichley test main main bas kharaab shot khelkar out ho gaya, lekin team ne acchhee cricket kheli main khush hum
 " pujaara kaa kahana he ki nae coach anil kumble bhi unki ballebaazi se santusht hai
 Although he did not say what he advised Pujara, Pujara missed no opportunity to practice in the nets before the second Test
 wo opshnal practice ke din bhi ballebaazi karne maidan par aate hai
 The comments cheteshwar pujaara ke mutabik "chize saral he, mujhe or zimmedaari ke saath ballebaazi kerani he
 i do not have to worry too much nor think about what is being said about me
 kumble se mere baat hu he jo main aapako nahin bataa saktaa, wo meri ballebaazi se khush hai"
 Pujara seems restless, but if he does not speak in Jamaica like Antiga, it is difficult to say how happy Captain Kohli will be
 pujaara ko yaad rakhana chahie ki keel rahul jaisaa ballebaaz bainch par baitha he jo captain kii pasand he or har maukey par apane aap ko sabit kar rahaa he
 Pujara says that new coach Anil Kumble is also satisfied with his batting
 haalanki unhone pujaara ko kya salaah di he ye to unhone nahin bataaya, magar pujaara duusare test match se pehle nets main abhyaas karne kaa koi mauka nahin chook rahe
 He also comes to the field to bat on the day of the practice
 tippaniyan According to Cheteshwar Pujara, "things are simple, i have to bat with more responsibility
 mujhe zyada chintaa kerani kii zarurat nahin he or naa hi ye sochane kii, ki mere bare main kya kaha ja rahaa he
 i have spoken to Kumble, which i cannot tell you, he is happy with my batting "

 When Chacha asked anything about corruption, Champu replied, corruption will not settle by any Lokpal, it will be defeated by a strong interlocutor
 ab ye atarlokapal kya bhalaa he bhala
 So this will tell the famous poet and writer Ashok Chakradhar
 unhone haal hi main ek kitaab likhi he, 'champu kaa antarlokapal'
 This book, printed with Vani Prakashan, will be released on Wednesday at Oxford Book Store in New Delhi
 is dauraan ashok chakradhar pathakon se baaten bhi karenge
 The program will start at 6 pm
 kitaab ke bare menkai baar lag saktaa he ki champoo apane uttaron ke liye hi chachaa se sawaal puchhawata he
 a reader told me that it seems you are Chacha and you are also Champu
 maine koi pratirodh nahin kiya
 He told them, one man must think in the same way, it is not necessary, there may be two men inside that one man
 alag-alag tarah se sochane vaale
 We understand that we know the nature of our thinking, it is not so
 kabhi-kabhi yah bhi hota he ki ham jo jaanate hai, hamen lagata he ki ham nahin jaanate hai
 There is a constant conflict between our inner and outer world
 muktibodh kehete hai ki hamaari chetana in donon main talmail bithaati he
 One of the Chacha and Champu speaks of the outside world and the other speaks after the intermission
 baharhaal, varsh san do hajaar, andar or baahar ke bhrashtachar ko samarpit rahaa he
 When Chacha asked anything about corruption, Champu replied, corruption will not settle by any Lokpal, it will be defeated by a strong interlocutor
 ham baahar ke brahmad ko chaan maaren or apane andar kii duniya ko na nihaaren ki vahaan kaise-kaise cond ho rahe hai, aisa kaise chalegaa? baahar baitha lokapal kahaan-kahaan camere lagavaayega
 People of the dead soul will keep saying, It is ours, it is yours, what will Anna Hazare do? Eaters will eat ice cream, what will the Badboli team do? Both believe that the inner Lokpal will be stronger than the Lokpal placed outside to eradicate corruption
 ab ye to samay hi batayega ki aage kya hona he
 All democratic powers should at once instill in the public the impression that they are supporters of the Lokpal Bill
 ab vah lokapal-vidhaan loktantr kaa bhoot sabit hoga yaa majboot, yah to uske paalankartaaon or vyavahartaaon par nirbhar karegaa
 By and by i remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar, he said that no matter how good a constitution should be, if the people who follow it are not good then they will not be able to take advantage of that constitution
 or koi samvidhan kitna hi kamjor kyon na ho, agar uske chalaane vaale achche hai to vah bhi laabhakaari ho saktaa he
 Similarly, Lokpal bill is, make it weak or strong, if its followers are right, there is no whey or curd in their intention, then the country will be fine
 majboot se majboot or kathor se kathor lokapal bhrashtachar ko jad se samaapt kar degaa, aisa sochna bhayankar bhul he
 Brought from above, enacted by law, debates of Parliament, any Lokpal bill passed after debates and no Lokpal or democracy dictator can eradicate corruption in this country

 The Union Home Minister Amit Shah will present the Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2019 in the Lok Sabha today
 is bill kaa vipakshi partiyaan purajor virodh kar rahi hai, iske alaava kai sanghathan bhi iskaa virodh kar rahe hai
 Most of the opposition to the new law of the Modi government is taking place in the Northeast, people are speaking out against the Central Government by taking to the streets
 sirf assam main is bill ke virodh main somvaar ko 16 sanghathanon ne 12 ghante kaa band bulaayaa he
 Apart from these, tribal students have also supported this bandh, protests against the bill are going on in other states besides Assam
 naagarikta kanoon se pehle enarasi kaa bhi bharpoor virodh kiya gaya tha
 Read the full coverage related to the citizenship bill by clicking here
 
 
 purvottar ke log kyon kar rahe hai virodh?centre sarkaar jo naagarikta sanshodhan bill laa rahi he, vah puure desh main lagu hona he
 But most of this is being opposed in the northeastern states including Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Meghalaya
 darasal, bangladesh se adhiktar hindu-muslim log jo border paar kar is taraf aate hai vah in rajyon main hi bas jate hai
 Now if the Hindu people from outside will get citizenship under the new law, then they will settle there forever
 iskaa sidhaa asar votbank par bhi padegaa
 Apart from this, local citizens have termed it a threat to the linguistic, cultural identity of the Northeast
 sirf purvottar hi nahin balki bengal main bhi mamata banerjee ne ise bengali asmita se jod diya he
 However, the Inner Line Permit Area of arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram have been excluded from the bill in view of the protest
 iske alaava ye bill north east ke chathe shedul kaa bhi bachaav karata he
 Why dispute over citizenship law? What was there before and now what? Understand in point 10 that CAB has a relationship with NRC? Actually, there is another reason why people of Northeast oppose this bill
 kyonki assam main enarasi lagu ho gaya he or ise deshbhar main lagu kiya ja rahaa he
 Through this, most of the people who are moving out of the country are Muslims
 or duusari ore CAB kii vajah se jin logon ko naagarikta milegi vah bhi gaiyr-muslim honge, yahi kaaran he ki sthaneey dal jabardast virodh kar rahe hai
 Explain that under the new bill, it will be easier for non-muslim refugees from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan to get Indian citizenship
 jabaki muslimon ko naagarikta ke niyam main shaamil nahin kiya gaya he

 Expressing concern over the mob lynching incident in the country and the use of 'jai Shri Ram' slogan as a weapon, 61 others were sent three days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi was written by 49 well-known personalities
 In a letter to the PM, the PM has been accused of writing 'letters of anger on select incidents, telling false stories and clearly political bias'

 ITPO general manager Guna Sekaran said that earlier states were given a space of four to four and a half thousand square feet as a pavilion, which has been reduced from 400 to 600 square feet per state this time
 sekaran ne kaha ki is barmeleke saath-saath construction kaa kaam bhi chalegaa
 Due to this, there will be a slight difference in the size of the fair, but in spite of this, food, display of all the states and foreign Hungarians are getting involved on the same scale

 Narayanan termed the claims of a former DRDO scientist on the Pokhran-2 nuclear tests as "shocking" and said that India has thermonuclear capability confirmed by a team of distinguished researchers

 Eminent scientific figures such as Srinivasan were members of the AEC and Raja Ramanna, the pioneer of the nuclear program, was part of the apex body that studied the findings of the 1998 nuclear test
 rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ne kaha, ‘‘thermonucleear divaais (hydrogen bam) kaa utpaadan (visphot se nikali urja) 45 kiloton kaa tha
 i have chosen my words with great precaution, 45 kilotons and no one can refute that which is proved by the figures that are there and they include Mr

 main samajhataa hum ki santhanum sirf atishyoktipurna baat hi nahin kar rahe hai, balki kuch aisi baat kar rahe hai jo stabdh karne vaala he
 "there is no need for public debate," he said, adding that there is no need for any public debate on the issue as it requires a clear understanding of explosive ballistics, neutron physics, material science and computer simulation

 Patnaik told how he has seen paranic characters with a different perspective
 patnayak ne kaha, main hanuman ke madhyam se vedon or upanishdon main jo gyaan he, jo aam jan tak pahunchane kii koshish karata hum
 It was earlier limited to Brahmins

 On today's scenario, Patnaik said, we are all tug of war, not dialogue
 ham duusare kii sun nahin rahe hai, sirf apni baat sach sabit karne main tule hai
 Brahman means to open the inner bound
 teen tarah ke log hote hai, pehle ve jo sochate hai pataa nahin saamne vaala kya bol rahaa he jane do, duusare ve jo sahi galat main ulajh gaye or tisare ve jo sun rahe hai
 Writer Devdutt Patnaik said, "generally we analyze stories, but do not think of a philosophy like Hanuman Chalisa
" is sabakaa apana mahatv or itihaas he
 It has a different history in Maharashtra and different in Orissa
 ye sab research mujhe pasand he
 Analyzing God, Patnaik said, "the one who controls time and space is God
" ham ek samay main duusari jagah nahin ja sakate, lekin bhagwaan bhoot or bhavishya donon main jate hai
 Whatever is liberated from the bondage of time, the organism that is free, we call God
 ye hamen apni aatma kii tarah lekar jaataa he

 People of Pisces should offer water chestnut to Lord Surya

 Offer worship to Suryadev, worship of Falakhatha is mainly worship of Lord Surya and nature, so offer the naturally received items in Chhath, whatever is offered in the soup, first offer it to Surya Dev and then offer Arghya to Lord Surya without offering the Sun to Arghya
 It will not be beneficial to offer things to the god, in this way, to get the grace of Suryadev, he has to offer those special things
 Ati are like them
