 Strange stories of death came out of North Korea many times
 magar ye pehla mauka he jab marshall kim jong un ke desh se live encounter kaa ek sansanikhej video saamne aayaa he
 In this video, Kim Jong Un's army is seen running and shooting his own soldier
 kehete hai ki is sainik ko uttar korea kii sarakri nitiyaan pasand nahin thim
 He had just opened his mouth against it and it was done that he was put to death on camera
 north koreaka cheharaa benakaab karata video saamne aayaa he
 Kim's soldiers gunned down their own comrades
 border paar karne par uske upar kai goli chalaai gai
 This sensational video has surfaced from the borders of North and South Korea
 sabase pehali tasviir uttar korea ke sarahadi ilaakon par tej raftaar daudti ek car kii he
 Which is moving rapidly through the fields towards the border of South Korea
 chunki maamla sarahadi ilaake kaa he, lihaaza watch tower par lage camere se is car par nazar rakhi ja rahi he
 Wherever this car is going, the cameras are following it
 shuruuaat main car kii raftaar ne shako shubha paidaa karnaa shuru kar diya ki aakhir kyon ye car itani raftaar main dakshin korea ke border kii taraf chali aa rahi he
 The speed of the car slowed down a little after coming to this fork, but the very next moment the man driving the car turned the steering towards the road going to the left
 car bain taraf mudate hi ab dakshin korea main watch tower main baitha shaks alert ho gaya usne behad sanjidagi se apane camere se is gaadi ko follow karnaa shuru kar diya
 Where the car was going, the camera was following it
 or ab to ye car dakshin korea kii seemaa se thik pehle bane is pul par daudna shuru kar detii he
 The car was going to be hidden in the middle of the dense trees but since the matter was serious, it was being followed in every situation
 aapako bataa den ki is car kaa driver uttar korian sena kaa sainik he
 Which is in the process of fleeing North Korea to South Korea
 dakshin korea ke border ke nazadik aate hi car ke driver ne raftaar ko or bhi tej kar diya
 See this, he crossed this last post of North Korea on the border and started moving forward
 jo dakshin korian sarhad ke ekadam nazadik he
 At this point, the North Korean soldier slowed down the car and left the road on the road and started running towards South Korea
 apane sainik kii is harakat ko dekh border par tainaat uttar korea ke chaar sainik uski taraf tezi se bhaage
 He hoped that he would catch his rebel soldier
 magar ye chaaron jab tak border kii fensing tak pahunchate tab tak north korea kaa baagi sainik kaaphi aage nikal chukaa tha
 Second camera footage shows how the North Korean Yebagi soldiers hurried towards South Korea's fencing with a car on the roadside
 lekin maukey par pahunchate hi uske hi saathiyon ne bina soche samajhe us par firing shuru kar di
 These pictures of North Korea's rebel soldier crossing the border are surprising
 apni hi sena ke sainik ko thikaane lagane ke liye uttar korian phogiyon ne 1953 main huye ek yudhviram samjhaute kaa ulanghan bhi kar diya or dakshin korea ke hisse main ghus aae
 An officer of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea said that North Korea's border security forces fired at least 40 bullets to prevent this soldier from crossing the border
 uttar korian sainikon kii goli kha kar unka baagi sainik dakshin korea kii zamin par dher ho gaya
 And on the other side, a dozen North Korean soldiers stared at him from across the border
 magar wo us paar jake apane sainik ko laa nahin sakate the
 Then two more soldiers came running and went close to the South Korean border
 magar unka baagi sainik unki pahunch se kaaphi dur tha
 Here the soldier was lying face down
 thodi hi der main sarhad ke is paar se dakshin korian sainikon ne harakat dikhaai or fensing ke nazadik zakhmi haalat main pade uttar korea ke baagi sainik ko do dakshin korian sainikon ne khinch kar apni seemaa ke bilkul andar kar liya
 He was immediately removed from the border and admitted to the nearest hospital
 jahaan kaaphi mashkkat ke baad doctor uski jaan bachaane main kaamyaab hue
 But his condition is still critical

 bacchee kii kad-lathi dekhakar yah abhas hota he ki uski umr 10 se 15 varsh ke bich hogi
 The girl is named Chahat
 aashcharya is baat kaa he ki bacchee kaa aakaar har kaaphi teji se bad rahaa he jabaki umr saamaanya rup se hi bad rahi he
 The baby has to face a lot of difficulties due to its abnormal weight
 wo maa kii god main aana chaahati he par use uthaa kar rakhana bahut mushkil he
 Doctors are also shocked to see so much weight at such a young age
 chahat kis vajah se itani baari bharkam ho gai, isaki jaanch ke liye uske khun kaa namoona lene kii koshish kii jaati he lekin moti chamadi main syringe tak nahin ghus paati
 Suraj, who lives in Mokampura area of amritsar, told that his daughter Chahat was absolutely normal at birth
 uskaa vajan 4 kilogram tha
 We were very happy that the baby girl was born in the house
 lekin jaise-jaise din guzarate gaye chahat kaavjan apratyaashit dhang se badhane laga
 On seeing his body, a layer of thick skin climbed
 haath-paanv, pet or cheharaa baari ho gaya
 The skin of the body started hanging
 vah sara din sust rahane lagi
 Showed the doctor but did not understand the merge of desire
 kisi bhi aath maah kii bacchee kaa ausatan vajan 5 se 6 kilogram hota he par chahat kaa aakaar dinon-din badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Although its length is similar to that of normal children
 vajan atyadhik hone ke kaaran maa-baap ko har vakt use apni najaron ke saamne hi rakhana padataa he
 The desire has increased to 20 kg just by drinking mother's milk
 doodh ke alaava vah na kuch khaati he or na kuch piti he
 The child's behavior is like that of ordinary children
 mohalle main chahat sabhi bacchon ke liye kotuhal kaa vishay bani hui he
 However, this girl is being shown to a private doctor, her hormonal tests have been done here
 bacchee ke pita suraj ne bataaya ki unki aarthik sthiti thik na hone ke kaaran vah chahat kaa ilaaj karwaane main asamarth hai
 The amount of money that was spent in the tests of want
 aise main koi samaaj sevi sanstha unki sahaayta karen to bacchee kosamanya avasthaa main laayaa ja saktaa he
 The girl's mother Renu says that the doctors are not telling anything because the doctor is finding it difficult to find its vein

 As far as the sharing of land is concerned, the Allahabad High Court has already said that where Ramlala ji is sitting, that is Ram Janmabhoomi
 ramamandir mudde par yogi ne kaha ki aasthaa kaa sammaan hona hi chahie or nyaayalay ko jan aasthaa kaa sammaan karnaa chahie 
 He said that when the three-member special bench of Allahabad High Court has said that where Ramlala is sitting, there is Ram Janmabhoomi, then the dispute has ended there and there is no dispute of partition
 mukhyamantri yogi ne kaha ki vivaad main keval yah tay hona tha ki yah ram janmabhumi he yaa nahin he or jab yah tay ho gaya he to phir is vivaad ke samaadhaan main 24 ghante se 25waan ghanta nahin laganaa chahie
 Shri Ram Janmabhoomi is a matter related to faith and the Honorable Court should give its verdict on this within 24 hours, respecting public faith

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and Union Human Resource Minister Smriti Irani have clashed on Twitter
 abhi tak twitor par netaaon ke bayaan ke baad unke samarthak yaa bhakt morcha sambhaal lete the lekin smriti irani ne rahul gandhi ke handle par jaakar sidhe chunauti de di he
 No Via Media
 pehle aphis of arji ke handle se twit aata he ki
 
 
 @officeofrg IIT Student Group has been banned for criticizing the Modi government
 ab or kya karenge
 Then comes another tweet
 @officeofrg mukt abhivyakti hamaara adhikaar he
 We will fight against any attempt to suppress disagreement and debate
 iske baad smriti irani unheen ke handle par palat kar jawaab detii hai
 @officeofrg Yesterday you asked NSUI to disorder where the order is
 aaj aapke gunde mere ghar tab aae jab main kaam se baahar thi
 @officeofrg Tell your people that such an attempt took place in Amethi but they could not scare me
 ve ab bhi nahin daraa paaenge
 @officeofrg Tell me the time and place i am ready for a debate on education to governance
 @officeofrg agali baar se apni ladaai khud ladiye
 No hiding behind NSU1
 vaise main jaldi hi amethi laut rahi hum
 However, during the Delhi elections, Kiran Bedi did not accept the challenge of arguing when Kejriwal challenged
 kisi ke ghar jaakar pradarshan karne kaa record nikaalenge to aapako har party kaa naam milegaa
 Should a Union Minister have been challenged in this way
 kya ab bijepi ke kaaryakarta pradarshan karenge to ye chunauti di jaaegi ki netaa ko bolo saamne aae lekin kya kijiega twitor kii bhashaa personal ho jaati he
 The way Smriti Irani has challenged Rahul to come out openly, if this happens, then the leaders of the parties will now join the arena and their supporters or workers of organizations will enjoy the ticket by cutting the ticket
 rahul gandhi ne smriti irani ko jawaab nahin diya he, ho saktaa he sadma lag gaya ho
 It happened that IIT Madras gets a letter from the Union Human Resource Ministry on May 15 that Ambedkar Periyar Student Circle students there are criticizing the policies of the Modi government and spreading hatred
 24 may ko iaiti madras ke dean sivakumar em shrinivasana ne ambedkar periyar student cirkil ko email bhej kar kaha ki unke forum kii manyata radd kii jaati he
 a pamphlet was also submitted by the Under Secretary of the Ministry of Human Resources in which questions were raised on the corporate policies of the Modi government
 ye pamfalet kisi agyaat ne mantralay ko bheje the
 APSC members are opposing the decision
 inkaa kahana he ki dakshinpanthi samooh kii agyaat shikaayat par aisa kiya gaya he or unase unka paksh bhi nahin suna gaya
 The group asked how the letter of an unknown can be the attitude of majority students of IIT Madras
 in chaatro ne ambedkar periyar kii vichaardhaara ke prasar ke liye yah group banaaya tha
 The dean has said that these students were carrying out their activities using the name of the IIT but they also said that after investigation it was found that their activities were not proper
 enesayuai ke sadasyon ne kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri ke ghar par pradarshan kiya
 First Smriti Irani distanced herself from the controversy and said that IIT is an autonomous body, why the ministry is being dragged
 lekin media main unke hi mantralay kii wo chitthee chalane lagi jiske aadhaar par in chaatro ke charchaa samooh kii manyata radd kar di gai
 IIT Madras has said that it does not limit the expression of students
 unase ummid kii jaati he ki guidelins kaa anukaran karen
 It is not clear why IIT Madras considers criticism of the policies of the Modi government in a pamphlet that it was causing a feeling of hatred towards the government in the campus
 ab aate hai dilli sarkaar banaam centre ke vivaad par
 On Friday, the case was debated in different contexts in both the Supreme Court and the High Court
 centre sarkaar ne 25 may ke hai court ke faisle kii us tippanee ko chunauti di thi jisamen notification ko sandigdh bataate hue kaha gaya tha ki anti karpshan branch centre ke adhikariyon ko giraftaar kar saktaa he
 The Center said that their comments were not heard at the time of this comment
 is par supreme court ne aadesh diya ki dilli hai court dilli sarkaar kii yachika par sunwaayee karte vakt apane 25 may ke aadesh ke andar kii gai us tippanee ko alag rakhe jisamen notification ko sandigdh bataaya gaya tha
 The Delhi High Court was to hear the Delhi government's plea to cancel the notification, which was filed on 28 May
 supreme court ne hai court kii us tippanee par ste bhi nahin lagaaya jise centre ne chunauti di thi lekin alag rakhane ke liye bhi kah diya
 The Supreme Court has to decide on what the scope of the Anti Corruption Bureau is
 adaalat ne dilli sarkaar se teen hafte main anti karpshan bure ke adhikaar par uski raay maangi he
 The comments 25 may ko dilli hai court ne kaha tha ki anti karpshan branch centre ke adhikariyon ko giraftaar kar saktaa he
 The Center says it cannot
 isi se utsahit hokar kejariwal sarkaar ne vidhansabha kaa satr bulaakar notification ke khilaaf prastaav paas kiya or 28 may ko notification radd karne ke liye hai court main yachika daayar kii
 Why the Supreme Court did not go is not clear
 11 agast ko dilli hai court main phir sunwaayee hogi lekin shuukravaar ko adaalat ne apane antarim faisle main grahamantralay ke notification par ste nahin lagaaya he
 He asked the Delhi government to send the transfer posting orders made to the Lt Governor
 up-rajyapal is par charchaa kar sakate hai, agar aapatti hui to waapas rajya sarkaar ko bhej sakate hai
 The center has asked for affidavit as to how the work has been done in Delhi and other Union Territories
 ab aap ise haar or jeet ke lihaaz se dekhnaa chaahate hai ki kis court main koun jeeta yaa is lihaaz se dekhnaa chaahate hai ki yah maamla kis disha main bad rahaa hai
 Both courts have not fully accepted the point of either party in their interim orders
 na to anti karpshan branch ke adhikaar ko simit mana gaya or na hi centre kaa notification radd hua
 Does that decision of the Delhi High Court make some sense that the Delhi Government should send its decisions to the Lieutenant Governor
 agar notification radd nahin hua he to kya mana jaae ki antim faisla aane tak up rajyapal hi super bos honge
 After this, Smriti Irani responds by turning over his handle
 @officeofrg kal aapane NSUI se kaha ki jahaan order he vahaan dysorder kar den
 Today your goons came to my house when i was out of work
 @officeofrg apane logon se kahiye ki amethi main aisi koshish hui lekin ve mujhe daraa nahin paae
 They still won't be scared
 @officeofrg mujhe samay or jagah bataaiye main shiksha se lekar garvanence par bahes ke liye taiyaar hum
 @officeofrg Fight your own battle next time
 NSU1 ke peeche chhipakar nahin
 By the way, i am returning to Amethi soon
 vaise dilli chunaav ke vakt kiran bedi ne bahes karne kii chunauti ko sweekaar nahin kiya tha jab kejariwal ne chunauti di thi
 If you remove the record of performing at someone's house, then you will get the name of every party
 kya ek kendriya mantri ko is tarah se chunauti di jaani chahie thi
 If BJP workers now demonstrate, then it will be challenged that the leader should speak up, but what to do, the language of the tweeter becomes personal
 jis tarah se smriti irani ne rahul ko khulkar saamne aane kii chunauti di he, aisa hone laga to partiyon ke netaa ab akhaade main hi mila karenge or unke samarthak yaa sanghathanon ke kaaryakarta tikat kataa kar mukaable kaa anand lenge
 Rahul Gandhi has not responded to Smriti Irani, it may have shocked
 hua yah ki iaiti madras ko 15 may ke din kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantralay kii ek chitthee jaati he ki vahaan ambedkar periyar student cirkil ke chaatr modi sarkaar kii nitiyon kii aalochana kar rahe hai or nafrat failaa rahe hai
 On May 24, IIT Madras Dean Shivkumar M
 Srinivasan sent an email to Ambedkar Periyar Student Circle saying that the recognition of his forum is canceled
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay ke under secetry ne ek pamfalet bhi natthi kiya gaya tha jisamen modi sarkaar kii corporate parast nitiyon par sawaal uthaaye gaye the
 These pamphlets were sent to the ministry by someone unknown
 apiessi ke sadsy is faisle kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 They say that this has been done on the unknown complaint of the right wing group and their side was not heard from them
 group ne poocha ki kisi agyaat kii chitthee iaiti madras ke bahumat chaatro kaa nazariyaa kaise ho saktaa he
 These students formed this group to spread the ideology of Ambedkar Periyar
 dean ne kaha he ki ye chaatr iaiti ke naam kaa istemaal kar apni gatividhiyaan chalaa rahe the lekin unhone yah bhi kaha ki jaanch ke baad paaya gaya ki unki gatividhiyaan uchit nahin thim
 NSUI members demonstrated at the home of the Union Minister of Human Resources
 pehle smriti irani ne khud ko is vivaad se dur karte hue kaha ki iaiti ek swytt sanstha he, mantralay ko kyon ghasita ja rahaa he
 But that letter of his own ministry started running in the media, on the basis of which the recognition of the discussion group of these students was canceled
 iaiti madras ne kaha he ki wo chaatro kii abhivyakti ko simit nahin karata he
 They are expected to follow the guidelines
 yah saaf nahin he ki iaiti madras kisi pamfalet main modi sarkaar kii nitiyon kii aalochana ko kyon maanata he ki isse campus main sarkaar ke prati nafrat kii bhaavana fail rahi thi
 Now come to the Delhi Government vs Center dispute
 shuukravaar ko is maamle kii supreme court or hai court donon jagahon par alag-alag sandarbhon main bahes hui
 The central government had challenged the remark of the May 25 High Court verdict stating the notification as suspicious that the Anti Corruption Branch may arrest the officers of the Center
 centre kaa kahana tha ki is tippanee ke vakt unka paksh nahin suna gaya
 On this, the Supreme Court ordered that the Delhi High Court, while hearing the petition of the Delhi Government, should separate the comment made in its order of May 25, in which the notification was described as suspicious
 dilli hai court ko dilli sarkaar kii notification radd karne kii yachika par sunwaayee kerani thi, jise 28 may ko daayar kiya gaya tha
 The Supreme Court did not stay a stay on the High Court's comment which was challenged by the Center but also asked to be kept separate
 supreme court ko is par faisla dena he ki anti karpshan beuro kaa dayera kya ho

 If you remove the record of performing at someone's house, then you will get the name of every party

 If BJP workers now demonstrate, then it will be challenged that the leader should speak up, but what to do, the language of the tweeter becomes personal
 jis tarah se smriti irani ne rahul ko khulkar saamne aane kii chunauti di he, aisa hone laga to partiyon ke netaa ab akhaade main hi mila karenge or unke samarthak yaa sanghathanon ke kaaryakarta tikat kataa kar mukaable kaa anand lenge

 IIT Madras has said that it does not limit the expression of students
 unase ummid kii jaati he ki guidelins kaa anukaran karen
 It is not clear why IIT Madras considers criticism of the policies of the Modi government in a pamphlet that it was causing a feeling of hatred towards the government in the campus
 ab aate hai dilli sarkaar banaam centre ke vivaad par
 On Friday, the case was debated in different contexts in both the Supreme Court and the High Court
 centre sarkaar ne 25 may ke hai court ke faisle kii us tippanee ko chunauti di thi jisamen notification ko sandigdh bataate hue kaha gaya tha ki anti karpshan branch centre ke adhikariyon ko giraftaar kar saktaa he
 The Center said that their comments were not heard at the time of this comment
 is par supreme court ne aadesh diya ki dilli hai court dilli sarkaar kii yachika par sunwaayee karte vakt apane 25 may ke aadesh ke andar kii gai us tippanee ko alag rakhe jisamen notification ko sandigdh bataaya gaya tha
 The Delhi High Court was to hear the Delhi government's plea to cancel the notification, which was filed on 28 May
 supreme court ne hai court kii us tippanee par ste bhi nahin lagaaya jise centre ne chunauti di thi lekin alag rakhane ke liye bhi kah diya
 The Supreme Court has to decide on what the scope of the Anti Corruption Bureau is
 adaalat ne dilli sarkaar se teen hafte main anti karpshan bure ke adhikaar par uski raay maangi he
 The comments 25 may ko dilli hai court ne kaha tha ki anti karpshan branch centre ke adhikariyon ko giraftaar kar saktaa he
 The Center says it cannot
 isi se utsahit hokar kejariwal sarkaar ne vidhansabha kaa satr bulaakar notification ke khilaaf prastaav paas kiya or 28 may ko notification radd karne ke liye hai court main yachika daayar kii
 Why the Supreme Court did not go is not clear
 11 agast ko dilli hai court main phir sunwaayee hogi lekin shuukravaar ko adaalat ne apane antarim faisle main grahamantralay ke notification par ste nahin lagaaya he
 He asked the Delhi government to send the transfer posting orders made to the Lt Governor
 up-rajyapal is par charchaa kar sakate hai, agar aapatti hui to waapas rajya sarkaar ko bhej sakate hai
 The center has asked for affidavit as to how the work has been done in Delhi and other Union Territories
 ab aap ise haar or jeet ke lihaaz se dekhnaa chaahate hai ki kis court main koun jeeta yaa is lihaaz se dekhnaa chaahate hai ki yah maamla kis disha main bad rahaa hai
 Both courts have not fully accepted the point of either party in their interim orders
 na to anti karpshan branch ke adhikaar ko simit mana gaya or na hi centre kaa notification radd hua
 Does that decision of the Delhi High Court make some sense that the Delhi Government should send its decisions to the Lieutenant Governor
 agar notification radd nahin hua he to kya mana jaae ki antim faisla aane tak up rajyapal hi super bos honge

 Actually, the Patna High Court, while hearing a PIL on the issue of the second AIIMS, has asked why its construction is delayed
 nadda ne kendriya swasthya mantri ke apane kaarykaal ke dauraan darbhanga main hi ames banane ke prastaav ko manzur kiya tha lekin baad main kendriya swasthya rajyamantri ashvini choube ke ishaare par ise khatai main daal diya gaya tha
 In fact, the AIIMS case is complicated by the fact that the state government is not providing land
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa prastaav he ki nae ames ke nirmaan se behatar hoga ki darbhanga medical college aspataal kaa adhigrahan kar len or apni suvidha ke anusaar or maapdand ke anusaar jin bhi doctoron ko rakhana ho yaa karmchaariyon ko unhen rakhen
 Otherwise, the state government will transfer him to another medical college
 kendriya swasthya rajyamantri ashvini choube yen-ken prakaren ames ko apane paitruk jile bhagalpur le janaa chaahate hai
 However, after Nadda's statement, the state government has breathed a sigh of relief
 uskaa kahana he ki kam se kam darbhanga ke naam par koi vivaad nahin he
 Now the whole matter depends on whether the central government builds new AIIMS or starts the work of converting Darbhanga Medical College into AIIMS by following the words of Nitish Kumar
 rashtriya kaaryakari adhyaksh shri jepi nadda ji ne baapu sabhaagaar main kailashpati mishra ji kii punyatithi par yojit sabha main yah spasht kiya ki bahut jald darbhanga main bihar ko doosraa ames milane vaala he@jpnadda@sushilmodi@sanjayjaiswalmp@gopaljeebjp@bjpnagendraji@mangalpandeybjppic

 He said, 'congress has a history of political business in the name of poverty and poverty alleviation

 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav se pehle semifinal kii tarah maane ja rahe vidhansabha chunaavon main bhartiya janata party ko sabase bada jhatka laga he
 In Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, the power of the Bharatiya Janata Party has slipped and the Congress has once again shown itself
 ek taraf bijepi main jahaan pradhanmantri narendra modi, bijepi adhyaksh amit shah, uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath jaise star prachaarkon kii fouj thi to vahiin congress kii ore se akele adhyaksharahul gandhi morcha sambhala
 Rahul has proved to the BJP in this battle that he is no less than anyone
 rahul bane vipaksh ke netaa number 1!pehle gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko kaante kii takkar, phir karnataka main sarkaar bananaa or ab teen rajyon main sidhi bijepi ko patkhni dene se ye tay ho gaya he ki rahul gandhi vipaksh ke netaa number van hai
 Questions have been raised from time to time on Rahul's leadership, but the manner in which Rahul Gandhi has given results after taking over as president has stopped all questions
 sirf vipaksh hi nahin balki shivasena, jediu jaisi partiyaan bhi ab ye kehane lagi hai ki rahul gandhi kii raajnneeti main paripakvata ai he
 After the victory in the assembly elections, the opposition will now enter the winter session of Parliament with full enthusiasm
 yani, sheetakaaleen satr main modi sarkaar ke khilaapcongresski aguwai main vipaksh aakraamak rukh apnayega
 Issues like Rafael, CBI, RBI, corruption can now increase the problems of Modi government in Parliament session
 MP main kisi ko bahumat nahin, sarkaar banane kii koshishe tej
 
 
 Live updates: There is no doubt that after this victory, Rahul Gandhi has got new political power to fight Narendra Modi
 vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ne ye bhi saaf kar diya he ki ab 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav or bhi zyada kadaa hone vaala he
 Because on one side there will be Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on the other side Rahul Gandhi is more than capable of victory
 vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon se wo kya baaten hai, jo rahul gandhi ko sabase bada khilaadi banaati hai
 Read here 
 
 1
 In 2019, Rahul Gandhi has emerged as the leader of the opposition in front of Narendra Modi
 yani rahul gandhi vipaksh ke netaa number van hai
 2
 pichley kuch saal main ye pehali baar hua he jab congress ne sidhi takkar main bhartiya janata party ko maat di ho
 3
 congress kaa sidhaa taur par jeetna ye bhi bataata he ki jaruri nahin ki bijepi ko haraane ke liye sirf mahagathbandhan hi chahie
 Looking at the election results, the biggest thing for the Congress right now is that the BJP lost
 2019 kaa kya hoga, wo aage dekha jayega
 But the message has gone clear that 2019 will not be as easy as it was supposed to be for Narendra Modi
 janata ko pasand aayaa rahul kaa tikhaa tevarrahul gandhi ne apni har chunavi raily main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf aakraamak rukh apanaaya
 The issue of Rafael, the issue of suppressing institutions, Congress President Rahul Gandhi looked completely aggressive on many important points including CBI and RBI
 10 dinon ke andar karj maafee kaa vaada bhi janata ko bhaayaa or chhattisgarh, rajasthan or madhya pradesh kocongresski jholii main daal diya
 Rahul Gandhi's magic in Chhattisgarh was that on the basis of 20 rallies of the Congress President, the party without a face got 67 seats
 chhattisgarh ke alaava bhi rajasthan, madhya pradesh main rahul ke road sho, raily ne kamaal kar diya
 After the victory, the big Dilrahul Gandhi spoke to the media even after winning a big victory in three states
 unhone jeet ke baad bada dil dikhaate hue teenon rajya main bijepi kii sabhi sarkaron ko unke kaam ke liye dhanyavad diya or use aage badhaane kaa vaada kiya
 At the same time, Rahul also said that he does not want 'BJP mukt Bharat'

 According to the sources, at the meeting of the Congress core group, it has been agreed that the pressure of Ashwani Kumar's resignation should not be pressurized

 This situation has happened to Virat Kohli
 ek he boodha baap yuvaraj, do padhe likhe lekin berozegaar bete
 
 dhawan or rohit sharma, karja badhaane vaale do saale
 
 jadeja or raina
 There is a mother like Dhoni, who manages four household utensils and manages the expenses of the house
 
 Otherwise, when would the house break
 
 After Virat Kohli's team India reached the semi-finals of the Virat Dum Parworld T20, this joke on social media on the lines of 'kohli's dam jalusa, rest of the grass-straw' is not a joke about the thinking of cricket lovers of the country, their mentality It is a reflection of itself
 bas antim line jisamen dhoni ko jo asahaay bebas maa bataaya he, vah paridrishy ke vipareet isliye he ki ek yuvaraj ko chhod den jo bisisiai main satta badal ke baad apekshaakrit kamjor ho chale dhoni kii ichha ke vipareet chayankataron kii pasand the, anyathaa ravindra jadeja or suresh raina jaise ausat darje ke khilaadiyon ko varshon se jo dhoya ja rahaa he vah bhartiya captain ke chalate hi to
 The same can be said for Kamobase Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma, who have been the moong team on the chest of Indian fans and sports lovers, replacing Manish Pandey and previous IPL successful opener Robin Uthappa
 koi harj nahin, yadi captain ko uski pasand kaa khilaadi miltaa he, lekin pradarshan ko lekar javabdehi ke saath
 But 'saiyaan bhai kotwal then fear kah kahe ka'
 shaayad hi kabhi captain ne in chaaron ko team main barkaraar rakhane par koi spashtikaran diya ho
 Well, Jadeja is a great fielder and can do a lot of spin bowling with his left hand on a lively pitch, but who has been taken as an all-rounder, Sudhey sports lovers do not know that this man off the bat will never leave his selections k could not justify, while Jadeja has three incredible triple centuries in first class cricket
 lekin kya aaj tak kisi bhi formet main ek bhi mauka usne shaayad hi diya ho jab cricket panditon ko mahaan vinu mankad or ravi shastri (team diarector) jaise spinner alrounders kii yaad ai ho
 Recall that veteran Australian cricket champion Greg Chappell had called Suresh Raina the most promising talent in the country before his dismissal as coach, more than a decade has passed, how much is this UP player still on short balls? It seems that everyone knows this

 hegade ne kaha ki aise haalat main shaktishaalee kanoon banane par sawaal khadaa ho gaya he
 According to Hegde, the government wants to keep the horse trading by the Prime Minister, the judiciary and the military out of the purview of investigation
 aaj sibiai ko artiai ke daayre se baahar rakhaa gaya he kal ye kaha ja saktaa he ki police ko bhi is daayre se baahar rakhaa jaae
 Hegde also said that one day the government would realize that he could have done a good job but he missed the opportunity

 SP chief Mulayam Singh on Monday tried to calm the ongoing conflict between brother Shivpal Yadav and son Akhilesh Yadav
 is dauraan mulaayam, shivpal or akhilesh ne apni-apni baat rakhi
 Some such issues came up, on which these political nobles of the Yadav family gave their arguments
 1
 On the sharing of power: Akhilesh i became the CM with the blessings of Netaji
 sab netaji kaa he
 Sapanetaji's party
 is party main meraa kuch bhi nahin he
 i have only done work for the public
 tikat kaa bantwaaraa main hi karuunga
 i became the party president on Shivpalanetaji's orders
 kya maine siem se kam kaam kiya he
 Lead the UP mujhe party chalaane kii chhot mili
 Mulayam (from Akhilesh) There are many people over you too
 pad paane se aapkaa dimag kharaab ho gaya he
 Can you win an election alone? What is your status? 2
 samaajawaadee party ke astitv par:mulymamain jaanata hum kismajawaadee partikabhi tut nahin sakati
 We are going through a difficult period
 hamen hamaari kamajori dur kerani hogi or ek-duusare se ladanaa chhodana hoga
 This party is formed with the sweat of Shivpalanetaji's blood
 kisi ke naare lagane se sarkaar nahin banegi
 The party is full of goons, rascals and makkar
 netaji ab aapako netritv sanbhaalane kii jarurat he
 Akhilesh my father is my mentor
 netaji ne mujhe anyaay se ladanaa sikhaaya
 Why would i make a different party? kai log galatfahami paidaa kar rahe hai
 i have always worked to advance the party
 agar maine koi seemaa langhi he to maaf karnaa
 3
 amar singh par:akhileshkuch log mere or netaji ke khilaaf kaam kar rahe hai
 If there is a conspiracy against Netaji and against the party, i will not be calm
 amar singh kaa bayaan mujhe aahat karne vaala tha
 Amar Singh is the villain
 mulaayanmar singh meraa bhai he
 i cannot hear a word against Amar Singh
 amar singh ne kai baar hamaari madad kii he
 You abuse him agar amar singh mujhe nahin bachaate to mujhe saat saal kii sajaa hoti
 If you abuse someone, will he touch your feet? shivpal2003 main amar singh kii madad se sarkaar bani thi
 Officers did not listen to me at the instigation of CM
 kuch log amar singh ke pairon kii dhul ke baraabar nahin hai
 4
 party main andhergardi par:mulaayam(akhilesh se) kya juaariyon or sharaabiyon kii madad kar rahe ho? kya akele chunaav jeeta sakate ho? tumhaari haisiyat kya he? narebaaji karne waalon ko nikaal baahar karenge
 Those who raise slogans know what, how we have fought
 shivapabgar jarurat padi to ham logon ko party se nikaalenge
 Netaji struggled to build the party
 aaj jahaan party khadi he, wo sirf netaji kii vajah se he
 i too have contributed a lot to the party
 anushaasanheenata bardaasht nahin kii jaaegi
 Action has been taken against those who make Akhilesh
 netaji ne mujhase kaha ki tum prajapati ko bachaate kyon nahin
 Netaji told me that if the CM saves, Prajapati will survive
 par maine unase kaha ki wo meri sunata nahin he
 Akhilesh uncle Shivpal was also hugged at Mulayam's behest but after that both of them hugged each other
 donon ke bich manch par khuleam bahes hui or hathapayee kii naubat tak aa gai
 Ultimately, Mulayam's attempt to save the sp's credibility seems to be failing at the moment and the family feud continues

 5 tivrata ke bukamp ke jatke mahasoos kiye gaye
 The question now is whether the real cause of the earthquake is a sharp movement in tectonical plates
 itnaa hi nahin, ulka prabhaav or jwalamukhi visphot, mine testing or newclear testing kii vajah se bhi bukamp aate hai
 There are millions of earthquakes worldwide every year, but their intensity is low
 is vajah se inako ham mahasoos nahin kar pate hai
 The National Earthquake Information Center records about 20,000 earthquakes every year, of which 100 are earthquakes that cause damage
 aise maapte hai bukamp kii tivratabukamp kii tivrata or avadhi kaa pataa lagane ke liye seismograph kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he

 iske aadhaar par ganitiya paimaana (richter paimaana) ke jariye bukamp kii tarangon kii tivrata, bukamp kaa centre or isse nikalne vaali urja kaa pataa lagaaya jaataa he
 There is a part of the seismograph that does not move even when an earthquake occurs and the other parts start shaking
 jo hissaa nahin hilta he, wo bukamp kii tivrata ko record karata rahata he
 Based on this, a seismogram is prepared, which helps to get accurate information about earthquakes

 yah nishkarsh america kii uniwarsity of colorado ke roger bilham or uniwarsity of montana kii rebeka bendic ne bukamp par hui research main nikaala he
 Both scientists studied all the major earthquakes that came 1900 years ago for this research
 inke mutabik beete paanch saal main duniya main dharti ke andar uthal-puthal kii ghatnaayen badi hai
 Earlier, due to this reason, seismologists said that due to the difference in the speed of the Earth's rotation in the last century, about five times 7
 0 tivrata ke bukamp aae the
 In this century also, in the last five years, there have been incidents of turmoil inside the world
 jiske chalate andeshaa lagaaya ja rah he ki 2018 main badabukampa sakate hai
 However, in which areas there will be earthquakes, it has not been clear in research
 lekin yah jarur dekha gaya he ki bumadhya rekha ke aasapaas ke ilaakon main din kii lambaai choti-badi ho rahi he

 It is said that Shah Jahan designed it himself, but according to the records, Abd al-hameed Lahori made a wooden model and presented it to Shah Jahan

 Realme x ko bharat main is saal 15 july ko launch kiya gaya tha
 This smartphone was launched in India for Rs 16,999
 hamane is smartphone ke saath lagbhag 1 maheene kaa vakt bitaayaa he or ab ham iskaa rivyuu aapse share karne ja rahe hai
 We have reviewed 8GB + 128GB variants of this smartphone, know whether you should invest money in this smartphone? Design and Display: First thing about the back panel of Realme X, here is a dual tone gradient panel
 ye panel glouci he, aise main bina cover ke tach karne par yahaan fingerprint najar aane lagate hai
 Here is a dual camera setup in the rear, which is placed in the vertical shape
 yahaan camere ke saath hi flash bhi maujuud he
 Phone slick is also easy to carry
 bas kuch logon van hand handlling main pareshaani ho sakati he
 The power button and SIM tray are placed here in the right panel
 yahaan keval do naino sim ke liye trey diya gaya he
 That is, you cannot use the memory card in this phone
 baaki bottm panel main tip-si port ke alaava, bottm firing spikars or 3
 Port is also provided for 5mm jack, which is good
 top panel kii baat karen to yahaan pop-ap selfi camere ko jagah di gai he
 There are volume rockers in the left panel here
 disple kii baat karen to yahaan gorilla glass 5 ke saath 6
 a 53-inch full-hd + OLED display is provided
 yahaan front panel main pop-ap selfi camere kii vajah se koi noch nahin milegaa
 Bezels are also much lower in the bottom
 yani aap koi bhi content behad mjedaar tareeke se enjoy kar paaenge
 Colors are quite bright, vivid and panchi
 inhen kisi bhi lite main aasaani se istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Here fingerprint sensors are also given in the display itself, which is quite fast
 kulamilaakar luk or dizin kaaphi impressive he
 Software and performance: First of all talk about the performance, here the company has used Snapdragon 710 processor
 joki vaaki is price range main kaaphi badhiya procesar he
 Let us tell you that Google's affordable 'premium' smartphone Pixel 3a has Snapdragon 670 processor and Realme X's close rival Redmi Note 7 Pro comes with Snapdragon 675 processor
 snapadragon 710 procesar ke saath ap swimming yaa multiple oparation main koi lag yaa shater yaa heating kii koi samasya nahin aegi
 This smartphone works in a very smooth way
 gamers ke liye bhi ye smartphone kaaphi behatar he
 Here, cooling gel technology has been used with Adreno 616 GPU
 saath hi software main Hyperboost 2
 0 and Game Boost 2
 0 jaise gaming mod bhi die gaye hai
 In such a situation, you will not have any complaints about gaming
 software kii baat karen to isamen android 9 pai besd coloros 6 ko diya gaya he
 Software can be called neither good nor bad here
 aamtaur par is price range main saare android custom UI ek jaise hote hai, jab to wo stock android naa ho
 oneplus works better in terms of custom UI
 haalanki Realme x kii baat karen to yahaan do chijen behatar hai, wo he ki aap anachaahe eps ko delit kar sakate hai
 That is, the complaint of blotware can be removed and like Xiaomi here you will not get many ads
 camera:iske rier main 48MP primary camera (soni IMX 586) or 5MP secondary camera diya gaya he
 Sony IMX 586 is available in oneplus 7 Series to Oppo Reno
 haalanki camere ke parformens ko jaahir taur par ek nahin kaha ja saktaa
 This smartphone is also 1 / 2 like the smartphone with the rest of the 48MP camera
 0-inch sensor miltaa he, jo picksal bining technology kaa istemaal karata he
 However, in terms of direct language, the performance of the camera is not much different from the crowd, but yes it is somewhat better in terms of price
 de lite main camera behatar he or lo-lite main rialami ke puraane smartfones kii tulana main camera parformens acchhee he
 The most typical performance can be seen in portrait mode
 aamtaur par is range ke smartphone camere potrate main behatar parform nahin karte, lekin iskaa kaam kamaal kaa he
 At the same time, chroma boost, HDR and scene recognition also help the camera better
 48MP camere ke liye aapako sidhe acces yahaan nahin miltaa he, iske liye aapako settings main jaakar 48MP mod ko on karne kii jarurat hogi
 Apart from this, modes like Nightscape, Slow Motion, Expert and Panorama will also be available in the camera app
 iskaa nitscape mod bahut zyada behatar to nahin he, lekin keemat ke lihaaj se thik he
 oneplus 7 Pro also has the same Sony sensor but its nightmode is amazing, although its price is also high
 kehane kaa matlab ye he ki soni IMX 586 sensor ko is keemat main thodaa sa or behatar optimij kiya ja saktaa he
 Talking of selfie, f / 2 here
 0 aparchar vaala 16MP camera (soni IMX 471) diya gaya he or ye bhi behatar he
 Here selfie portrait is also good in terms of price
 yani kulamilaakar camera bhi kahin naa kahin acha he
 Photo samples: - Images are resized for the web
 bydaree:realme x kii bydaree 3765mah kii he or yahaan VOOC 3
 0 flash charge is supported
 fast charging kii vajah se ise kareeb ek ghante main hi 0-93% tak charge kiya ja saktaa he
 It can be run for about 12 to 14 hours in regular to heavy use
 yani bydaree bhi acchhee hi he
 Verdict: Realme managed very quickly to make a better place in India's budget and mid-range segment
 vajah thi ki isane sidhe taur par bajet leader Xiaomi ko target kiya
 After a lot of eyeballing, Reality launched a smartphone in which a lot was given in the mid-range segment i
e
 Rs 16,999
 kuch had tak iskaa muqabla Redmi Note 7 Pro se he, lekin phir bhi kai maamlo main ye aage he
 At present, Oppo K3 also comes in the same specifications and the same price range, but the 48MP camera is not available in the rear
 Realme x apane snapadragon 710, pop-ap selfi camera, 48MP rier camera, premium luk, in-disple fingerprint sensor, phul vyuu disple or fast charging saport jaise fitures is keemat main lene ke liye ek best smartphone he
 Only camera performance can be improved further

 buudhvaar ko bhaajapa ne vidhansabha ke donon sadanon main jamkar hangaamaa kiya or sadan chalane nahin diya
 Party leader Sushil Kumar Modi has said that BJP will not let the House function until Nitish Kumar sacks the minister from his cabinet

 14 sitambar, 1949 ke din hindi ko rajbhasha kaa darja mila tha
 Since then, this day is celebrated as 'hindi Day' every year
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki hindi diwas kyon manaaya jaataa he? iske peeche ek vajah he
 Let's know
 
 
 saal 1947 main jab angreji hukumat se bharatajadaua to uske saamne bhashaa ko lekar sabase bada sawaal tha
 Because hundreds of languages and dialects are spoken in India
 6 disambar 1946 main aaazaad bharat kaa samvidhan taiyaar karne ke liye samvidhan kaa gathan hua
 The Constituent Assembly approved its final draft of the Constitution on 26 November 1949
 aaazaad bharat kaa apana samvidhan 26 janvari 1950 se puredeshmen lagu hua
 But the issue of which national language of India will be chosen was very important
 kaaphi soch vichaar ke baad himdi or angreji ko nae raashtra kii bhashaa chunaa gaya
 The Constituent Assembly accepted Hindi written in Devanagari script as the official language of the nation along with the British
 14 sitambar 1949 ko samvidhan sabha ne ek mat se nirnay liya ki hindi hi bharat kii rajbhasha hogi
 The country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru said that seeing the importance of this day, Hindi Day should be celebrated on September 14 every year
 bataaden pehla hindi diwas 14 sitambar 1953 main manaaya gaya tha
 On 14 September 1949, the Constituent Assembly decided with a view that Hindi will be the official language of India
 angreji bhashaa ko hataae jane kii khabar par desh ke kuch hisson main virodh prardashan shuru ho gaya tha
 There were riots in Tamil Nadu in January 1965 over a language dispute
 janamanas kii bhashaa hai hindisal 1918 main mahatma gandhi ne hindi sahitya sammelan main hindi bhashaa ko rashtrabhasha banane ko kaha tha
 Gandhiji also called it the language of the people
 bhaajapa pratyaashee sadhvi pragna singh dwaara mahatma gandhi ke hatyare nathuram godse par die gaye bayaan kaa vivaad abhi shant bhi nahin hua tha ki gujarat ke surat se ek vivaad saamne aayaa he
 In the Limbayat area of surat, the birthday of Nathuram Godse, the murderer of Mahatma Gandhi, was celebrated, after which a new controversy has started again about Nathuram Godse
 surat ke limbayat ilaake main sthit ye vahi suryamukhi hanuman mandir he jahaan 19 may kii raat ko mahatma gandhi ke hatyare nathuram godse kaa janmdin celibrasion kiya gaya tha, mandir ke praangan main akhil bhartiya hindu mahasabha ke in logon ne nathuram godse kii tasviir saamne rakhkar janmotsav manaaya or ek duusare kaa munh meetha kiya
 People worshiping Godse, when the news of celebrating the birth anniversary of Nathuram Godse, the murderer of the Father of the Nation, spread through social media, the Gujarat government was in a hurry, the Gujarat government took action to take legal action in front of those celebrating Nathuram Godse's birthday
 Issued the order to the police
 surat ke police kamishnar satish sharma ne nathuram godse kaa janmdin manaane waalon ke kilaaf surat shahar ke limbayat police thane main maamla darj kar 6 logon ko giraftaar kiya
 All the accused arrested by the police are activists of the All India Hindu Mahasabha
 chaunkaane vaali baat to ye he ki ye unheen gandhi kaa gujarat hai jahaan gandhi kaa janm hua tha or jahaan se satyagrah ke jarie gandhiji ne desh ko aazaadee dilaai thi, usee gandhi ke gujarat main is tarah gandhi ke hatyare kaa janmdin manaae jane ko lekar gandhivadi log kaaphi naaraaz hai
 There is a lot of anger against these people among Gandhi supporters
 ek ore jahaan sadhvi pragna thakur ke jariye gandhi ke hatyare ko desh bhakt bataaya gaya, to vahiin duusari ore is tarah se gandhi ke hatyare godse kaa janmdin manaaya gaya
 In such a situation, the question arises that if people could not understand Gandhi's life, then they would not have done such activities at least if they had understood his values

 During this series i am not getting that rhythm in the opening spell

 'he said,' It is a matter of achieving a good rhythm and i am trying to do the same
 lay main hone par main duniya ke kisi bhi ballebaaj ko pareshaan kar saktaa hum
 i came into the series with a strategy that started with the wicket of Kane Williamson in Bangalore last year
 maine is siries main bhi use doharaaya
 Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav could not get wickets but Ashwin praised both the fast bowlers

 i am finding some overs to be frozen only after which i am able to bowl well
 ’unhone kaha,‘yah acchhee lay hasil karne kii baat he or main isi kii koshish kar rahaa hum
 Being in rhythm i can annoy any batsman in the world

 Weaver Bird (baya) is also seen making its shelter in the rural areas of the state
 rajdhani raipur or shahari kshetron main hare-bhare vrikshon ke abhaav main ye sadakon ke kinare chote pedo evam kheton ke bich lage pedo main apana ghonsle banaate hai
 Their preparations started from the first rains, worried for their family
 anek ghonsle taiyaar bhi ho chuke hai
 The beauty of their nests is made soon
 pradesh ke pakshi visheshgyon kii maane to monsoon main barish se bachane ke liye baya apana ghonslaa kaaphi saavdhaanee se taiyaar karti he
 The most interesting thing is that the male baia attracts the female while building the nest
 jab ghonslaa aadhi taiyaar ho jaati he to maadaa baya iskaa nirikshan karti he
 Only after this does Baya use her nest
 maadaa baya jab ghonslaa ko 'riject' kar detii he to iskaa upyog nahin kiya jaataa
 This is the reason why many unfinished nests are also seen among the herd of tree nests
 inke ghoslon kii banaavat bhi sundar or aakarshak hoti he
 Naib Tehsildar Anubhav Sharma, who has been studying the birds' habitat and behavior continuously for seven years, said that the weaver bird (baya) used to be seen mostly in urban areas, but now due to environmental side effects and decreasing greenery in urban areas
 Are constantly getting away from the living areas
 apane andon kii chintaa kii vajah se hi yah bade or oonchai vaale vrikshon main apane ghosle banaati hai
 Occasionally Baya's nests are also seen on tall trees in greenery areas of the city
 visheshgyon kii maane to ghonsle banane kaa jimmaa nar baya par hota he
 They prepare their nest in three to four days to avoid rain
 baya apane ghonsle kaa upyog sirf ek baar karte hai
 Baya looks like a sparrow
 prajnan kaal ke samay ye pile dikhte hai, baaki samay iskaa rang bhura hota he
 Mostly they nest on large trees around the cities or in greener areas of the city
 bataaya jaataa he ki baya apni colony banane main suraksha kaa vishesh dhyaan rakhti hai
 In large trees along the roadside, in high places, they decorate the shelter just behind the road, as vehicular movement can cause damage to the nest
 inhen sabase zyada khatra saanp se hota he, isliye ve apana ghonslaa oonche ped par banaate hai
 In the rounded part of the nest the female bayan hides her eggs
 monsoon khatm hote hi ye apane bacchon ke saath ghonslaa chhod detii hai
 Farmers in some areas of the state say that usually when the Bayas start making their own Ghosla, the farmers understand that the monsoon is close
 simga ke kisaan sunil banjaare kaa kahana he ki is baar samay se purv monsoon ke aa jane se baya ke ghonsle utani sankhya main nahin dikh rahe hai, jitna anya varshon main dikhaa karte the

 ajtak ko sutron ne jaankaree di he ki aatanki jis tareeke se apana trend badal rahe hai, vaise main suraksha agenciyaan bhi ab kisi tareeke se chook karne vaali nahin hai
 In fact, terrorists used to attack security forces by firing and throwing grenades
 in hamalon main suraksha bal kaa apper hand rahata tha or vah aatankwaadiyon ko baari sankhya main dher kar dete the
 According to a report of the Ministry of Home Affairs, in the last 3 years, security forces in Jammu and Kashmir have piled up 586 terrorists in separate operations
 yahi vajah he ki aatanki baukhalaahat main ab is tareeke aatmghaatee hamale karne ke nae trend kaa istemaal karne lage hai
 In view of this challenge, security agencies are also making changes in their standard operating procedures
 siarpief ke diji aar aar bhatnagar ne ajtak se baatcheet main kaha jis tareeke se jaish ke aatanki adil ahamed daar ne aatmghaatee hamalaa kar suraksha balon ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he, vaise main ab badalte hue trend ke aadhaar par apane oparating system main bhi badlaav kiya jayega

 Everyone considered Raghubardas Mahanta and no one had challenged him

 bharat main germany ke rajdoot maaikel steiner ne apane janmdin par satsang kaa program rakhaa he or isamen aane ke liye maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri smriti irani ko bhi nyotaa gaya he
 Significantly, there is a dispute about teaching Sanskrit instead of German in Kendriya Vidyalayas
 aise main satsang ke is nyote kaa khaas mahatv ho gaya he
 The German ambassador, however, categorically denies that the satsang has anything to do with the language controversy
 unka kahana he ki unhone or unki patni ne is sarkaar ke banane ke pehle hi ye tay kar liya tha ki satsang karaayenge
 For this, he wrote a letter to spiritual guru Ravi Shankar and he agreed
 satsang shuukravaar 28 november hoga
 The German ambassador says that the embassy has not invited anyone but a number of ministers and leaders have been invited
 pehle vah smriti irani kaa sidhe taur par naam nahin le rahe the, lekin patrakaron ke jor daalane par unhone bas itnaa kaha ki kai cabinet mantriyon ko nyotaa gaya he or sabhi kaa swaagat he
 When asked if RSS leaders and right-wing ideologue Dinanath Batra have also been invited, the ambassador said that the embassy has taken care of all and that the invitation has been taken in totality
 satsang is vishay par hoga ki alag-alag samskritiyon ko kaise nazadik laayaa jaae or europe evam bharat ke bich aapasi samaj behatar kaise kiya jaae
 When asked by Michael Steiner whether he hoped to resolve the German language dispute, the ambassador said he was confident that local law would lead to a respectful and practical solution to the issue
 jab se maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ne kendriya vidyalayon main teesri bhashaa ke vikalp ke taur par german chunane ko desh kii shiksha niti ke kilaaf qaraar diya he or uski jagah sanskrit padhaane kaa vikalp diya he tab se is mudde par germany ke rajdoot kaaphi sakriy hai

 input language america main saal 2011 main jab mira shankar rajdoot ke pad se vidaa hokar swadesh lautin to isse ek din pehle unki gharelu sahayika unka ghar chhodkar chali gai or phir lauti nahin
 The Indian embassy hid the matter from the media's eye
 mana ja rahaa he ki is sandarbh main police or videsh vibhaag ke paas aupchaarik shikaayat darj karai gai tathaa gharelu sahayika ke aadhikarik passport ko radd kar diya gaya
 There is no information about this domestic helper who served her during Meera Shankar's tenure of more than two years
 mana ja rahaa he ki vah america main gaiyr-kanoonee dhang se rah rahi he
 It was not the first domestic helper who left the house of an Indian diplomat
 isse pehle bhi gharelu sahayikaayen pichley kuch varshon main varisht bhartiya rajanyikon ke gharon ko chhodkar gayi
 Sources looking closely at such incidents said that the number of diplomats of domestic helpers attached to the Indian Embassy in Washington is more than a dozen in the past decade
 america main sirf gharelu sahayikaayen hi nahin, balki bharat se laae gaye bhartiya suraksha gardon ke bare main bhi mana ja rahaa he ki ve bhi sambandhit rajanyikon ke paas se chale gaye
 Most of them left at the end of their tenure
 bhartiya duutavas se judi gharelu sahayikaon ko yahaan 'india besd domestic assistant' (ibidie) kaha jaataa he
 The Indian Embassy did not respond to a question asked by PTI on how many ibdas its diplomats currently hold
 washington main duutavas ke alava neuyork, san francisco, huston, atlanta or chicago main bharat kaa vaanijya duutavas he
 Sources associated with Indian embassies and consulates in the US said that recently three cases involving domestic helpers came to light
 ye teenon maamle neuyork sthit vaanijya duutavas se jude the
 These include the case of Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade
 sarkaar ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki ghuspaith ke prayaason main seemapar agenciyon kii sanliptata ko lekar vah chaukanni he or aise prayaason ko vifal karne ke liye har sambhav upaay kiye ja rahe hai
 Union Home Secretary Madhukar Gupta said, "we are vigilant that training is being imparted in camps located across the border for infiltration
" unhone bataaya 'niyantran rekha par ham alert hai
 The Army and the BSF have been alerted
 ghuspaith ke prayaason ko vifal karne ke liye har sambhav prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 'earlier, the Center had admitted that about 50 militants from Gurez sector had infiltrated into Jammu and Kashmir
 gupta ne kaha 'hamaara spasht kahana he ki seemaa paar kii agenciyon kaa iske peeche haath he
 The international community has also widely accepted this fact
 ghuspaith ke puure mudde ko ham gambhirtha se le rahe hai
 We are alert and in constant need of monitoring
 ' isse pehle grih sachiv ne kaha tha ki barf pighalane se pehle se seemaa paar se ghuspaith ke prayaas jari hai
 a high-level meeting was recently held in Jammu and Kashmir to review the situation and security agencies were instructed to remain alert to thwart any attempt to infiltrate terrorists in the country
 aaj kaa din us shabd kaa he, jo bhartiya vaayu sena ke pakistan main ghuskar bam giraane ke baad astitv main aayaa he
 The Foreign Secretary of India called it non-military action
 angrezi main non-military kaha gaya he
 The term contains diplomatic artistry
 bamon se las ladaaku vimaan pakistan kii seemaa main ghus jaae, bam giraakar bagaiyr apane kisi nuksaan ke sakushal laut aae or kaha jaae ki yah a-sainya karrwai thi to muskuraana chahie
 The military also does non-military work
 iske matlab ko samajhane ke liye dictionari ko takalif dene kii zarurat nahin he
 There is a need to understand politics
 magar ek chook ho gai
 Amazing Indian Air Force, but Pakistan Army broke the news break
 bharat ke patrkaar der tak sote hai
 Anyway, there are astrology anchors in the morning channels
 is par bhi muskura sakate hai
 The first news was that Pakistan military spokesman Major General Ghafoor tweeted at 5
12 pm that the Indian Army has come inside and we just drove him away
 detail aane vaala he
 Then at 7 06 minutes the tweet comes that Indian ships entered the Muzaffarabad sector
 pakistani vayusena ne samay par javaabi karrwai kii to bhaagane kii hadabdaahat main balakot ke kareeb bam gira gaye
 No dead, no damage
 inkaa teesraa twit 9 bajkar 59 minute par aayaa ki ‘bhartiya kashmir ne azaad kashmir ke 3-4 mile ke bheetar mujaffarabad sector main ghuspaith kii he
 On being forced to return, the ships dropped the bomb in the open
 kisi bhi dhaanche ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaa he, takneekee detail or anya zaruri suchanaaen aane vaali hai
 After this, there was no tweet nor detail from Major General Sahab
 ab iske baad 11
 There is a press conference of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs on 30 minutes
 videsh sachiv vijay gokhale bataate hai ki aatanki sanghathan jaish ke thikaane ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya he
 India had strong information that Jaish was preparing for further suicide attacks in India
 use pehle hi be-asar karne ke liye a-sainya karrwai kii gai
 No citizen was killed
 is press conference main kisi sawaal kaa jawaab nahin diya gaya na poocha gaya
 The Indian Air Force was not named
 na hi lokation ke bare main saaf-saaf kaha gaya
 It is not even said that the ship sailed inside Pakistan or went to pok
 bharat ne aadhikarik bayaan ko simit rakhaa magar pakistan ne hi pushti kar di thi ki bharat ke jahaaz kahaan tak gaye the
 Later sources were quoted as saying where the operation took place
 umr abdulla ne pehle balakot ko lekar sawaal uthaae or kaha ki agar yah kashmir pakhtuunakva me hua he to bahut badi strike he
 If not, it is symbolic
 baad main unhone phir twit kiya or kaha ki karrwai kashmir pakhtuunakva main hui jo ki bahut badi baat he
 Media has its own challenges in times of war or tension between two countries
 of ricard or on ricard soochnaaon kii pushti yaa un par sawaal karne kaa dayera bahut simit ho jaataa he
 Whatever is sourced is usually the same
 kai channelon par chalane laga ki aatanki masood azhar kaa saalaa maaraa gaya he
 If the brother-in-law has gone, then the one who is killed will be the fucker! But whose statement was this, do not know
 kai baar raksha mantralay yaa videsh mantralay ke sutara hote hai magar sutron kaa vargeekaran saaf nahin he
 Off-record information also has credibility, but it becomes difficult when the media coverage starts to vary
 jaise marane waalon kii sankhya bhi alag alag bataai gai
 Pakistan kept saying that no one has died
 bhartiya vaayu sena apana shandaar kaam kar chup hi rahi
 No Tweeted
 is hamale ko kaise anjaam diya gaya isaki antim jaankaree nahin ai he
 Just keeps on coming
 miraj 2000 ladaaku vimaanon ke kamaal kii baat ho rahi he
 If no scrutiny is reached, then it can be thought that what level of strategy will be made
 bagair kisi chook ke aise aaparishan ko anjaam dena badi baat he
 The public was proud of the might of the Air Force
 badhaaiyon kaa tantaa lag gaya
 a second front opened up in the media
 apusht jaankariyon kii bharmaar ho gai
 Debates and slogans became political
 sarkaar or vayusena ke parakram ke maukey par channelon kii patrakarita (akhabaaron or website kii bhi) ke patan kii baat bhi aaj hi karuunga
 Today the government's terminology was more restrained and constructive
 magar channelon kii bhashaa or unke screen video game main badal chuke hai
 Understand this downfall of TV news in these moments of pride
 maine ye baat pehle bhi kii he or aaj hi karuunga
 There are different channels but everyone's public is now one
 baaki public channelon se baahar kar di gai he
 It seems from the anchors that he had taken the ship
 tabhi kaha ki hamaare desh main yuddh ke samay patrakarita ke adarsh maanak nahin hai
 Neither in front of us nor in front of them
 soochnaaon ko ham kis had tak saamne rakhen, badi chunauti hoti he
 There is a natural patriotism within all of us
 channelon ke screen se lagata he ki us deshprem kaa raajnneetikaran ho rahaa he
 Trust your patriotism more
 jo channel aapke bheetar deshprem garh rahe hai wo agar kal bhoot pret dikhaane lagen tab aap kya karenge
 This difference should be revealed in the same historical moments to record how the media is turning this history into a farce
 ise naatakeeyata kaa rup dekar wo kya kar rahaa he aapako dekhnaa hi padegaa
 You have to differentiate between the army, the success of the government, the antics of the media and the sanctity of information
 udhar pradhanmantri kii gatividhiyon main media se kahin zyada rachanaatmakataa rahi
 It seems that even today he did not watch the news channels
 shaayad dekhne kii zarurat nahin
 He was involved in programs ranging from Gandhi Peace Prize to Geeta Path
 gita kaa vazan 800 kilo kaa bataaya gaya or bam kaa 1000 kilogram kaa
 Both are non-military aspects
 jis gita kaa udghaatan kar aae wo italy se chap kar ai he
 Only then i say that today the channels have lost many opportunities for creativity
 aaj gandhi ko shanti mili yaa gita dwand hal hua, magar sutron kaa kaam khub hua
 Had they not been there, the channel would not have been able to make the program for more than five minutes
 pakistan ghir gaya he
 She is on the verge of psychological, strategic and diplomatic defeat
 baukhalayegaa
 Will do will be seen
 magar vah bhartiya paksh ke daavon ko sweekaar nahin kar rahaa he
 India's borders have been circumscribed in view of the possibility of his action
 yuddh hoga, koi nahin jaanata

 lekin sarkaar main aate hi party apane saare vaayade bhul gayi he

 The man-to-man man pursued hormone replacement therapy for many years to change sex
 haalanki usne mahila jananaang barkaraar rakhe
 Sperm donor or other information related to pregnancy has not been made public because the father did not want his son to be the center of attraction
 vaise aadhikarik rup se bachche kaa janm 18 march ko hua he or uski maa nahin he, balki sirf pita he
 The spokesperson of the Berlin Senate Administration for Internal Affairs said, "he wants to have the child's birth certificate not as a mother, but as a father
" or uski is ichha kaa sammaan kiya ja rahaa he
 Although the father also said that under no circumstances should the child's gender be told, the authorities did not care that the man had given birth to the boy
 udhar doctoron kaa kahana he, 'agar koi mahila purush ke rup main jeena chaahati he or dadhi badhaane ke liye hormone leti he or saath hi uske sharir main garbhashay or andashay bhi moujd he to pregnent hua ja saktaa he

 com / 7hguznz2t7 In Punjab, the government may claim to act vigorously to prevent farmers from burning, but the reality is that the government officer is in a dilemma after the farmer unions openly declared burning stubble
 afasaron ko samaj main nahin aa rahaa he ki wo gaanvon main jaakar kisaanon par sakhti kaise karen, kyonki kisaanon ne ultimatum de diya he ki wo karrwai karne ke liye aane vaale sarkari adhikariyon ko bandhak bana lenge
 At the same time, the Punjab Pollution Control Board is trying to strictly implement The Air Prevention and Control Act of 1981 to prevent stubble burning
 sarkaar ne chandigarh main kisaan netaaon or krishi se jude visheshgyon kaa seminar bhi karaayaa, lekin iskaa koi nateeja nahin dikhaa
 If you look at the number of cases filed in the last three years, in the last 3 years, then in 2016, the Punjab Pollution Control Board had registered 2,414 cases of burning stubble and imposed a fine of about Rs 6 lakh 65 thousand
 vahiin, saal 2017 main 11,005 cese darj kiye gaye or 61 lakh 47 hajaar rupee kaa jurmaana lagaaya gaya tha
 In 2018, 363 cases have been registered so far and a fine of Rs 3 lakh 62 thousand has been imposed
 kisaan unionon ke dabaav ke chalate nahin ho paati karrwisal 1981 main banaae gaye da air privension and control act main ₹500 se ₹15000 tak jurmaana lagane kaa praavdhaan he
 However, Punjab Pollution Control Board is also unable to take strict action due to pressure from farmer unions
 sangrur main jis tarah se ajtak ke camere ke saamne hi kisaanon ne apni majaburi kaa hawala dete hue kai kheton main paraali jalaai, usase lagata nahin he ki isko roak paanaa aasaan he
 However, after this incident, DC Ghanshyam Puri of Sangrur claimed that nodal officers have been deployed in every village to take further action to keep the incidents of burning of the system alive, but the reality is that there are hundreds of farmers unions workers And the farmers gather and hand over the straw to the fire, no government official can muster the courage to go there
 kisaanon ko samajhane kii koshish sabit ho rahi vifalsangrur ke DC ghanashyam puri ke mutabik kisaanon ko samajhane kii koshish lagaataar jari he or kisaanon ko paraali hataane kii mashiinon ke phaayde ke bare main bhi bataaya ja rahaa he
 They are being explained that there is absolutely no harm and benefit from burning the straw
 punjab sarkaarabhi kisaanon ke adiyal ravaiye or kisaanon dwaara paraali jalaane ko majaburi bataae jane ke chalate baikfoot par he
 The Punjab government has appealed to the farmers not to burn stubble
 shaayad sarkaar ko bhi pataa he ki sakhti karne se bhi kisaan maanane vaale nahin hai
 For this reason, the state government has cited the pollution caused by stubble burning to farmers and the deteriorating image of Punjab
 punjab sarkaar ne kisaanon se paraali na jalaane kii apil karne ke saath hi kisaan unionon, buddhijiviyon or kisaanon visheshgyon kaa seminar yojit kiya
 Farmers also have their own problems
 It is not the first time such a seminar has been held or the farmers are not aware of it
 yahaan sawaal kisaanon ke paise or samay kii bachat kaa he, jiskaa jawaab kisi ke paas nahin he
 The compulsion of the farmers is that the time for preparation of the next crop is less, then on the other hand it costs to collect the straw and what is to be done by collecting it is also a problem for the farmers
 haalanki krishi se jude export maanate hai ki jab sarkaar dhan kii kharid ke liye 40 hajaar karod rupee detii he, to kyon na sirf 2000 karod rupee or badha kar 200 rupee prati acre sabsidi kisaan ko de di jaae
 Also, special attention should be paid to the farmers who do not burn the straw
 dilli police ne do aise shaatir badmaashon ko giraftaar kiya he, jinpar hatya, lut or snatching sahit kai aapraadhik maamle darj hai
 The police had been searching for both miscreants for a long time
 do din pehle bhi aropiyon ne snatching kii ek vaardaat ko anjaam diya tha
 The ages of miscreants caught by the Delhi Police are just 19 and 20 years old
 itani kam umr main inke upar hatya, lutpaat,snatchingjaise kai sangeen maamle darj hai
 With the help of CCTV, the police managed to catch these miscreants
 police ke mutabik, dilli ke khyala ilaake main do din pehle donon badmaash ek mahila kaa purse chhinakar faraar ho gaye the
 Both appeared in CCTV footage at the police investigation
 police ne kadi mashkkat ke baad inhen dhar dabocha
 Police have also seized 5 bikes, 3 scooties, 5 mobiles and two knives from the possession of miscreants
