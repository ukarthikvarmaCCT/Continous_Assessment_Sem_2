 ayodhya vivaad kii sunwaayee main aaj supreme court ne bada roda saaf kar diya
 The Supreme Court has said that prayers in the mosque are not necessarily in Islam
 yani is aadhaar par daawa aaj khaarij ho gaya
 The Supreme Court has upheld the old judgment of the 1994 Ismail Faruqui case and now hopes of a speedy settlement of the case have been strengthened
 supreme court ke is faisle par AIMIM ke adhyaksh asaduddin ovaisi kaa kahana he ki agar ye faisla sanvaidhanik peeth ko refer ho jaataa to acha hota
 Mosque is an essential part in Islam
 quran or haddees main is baat zikr he
 It is a matter of regret that when the issue of triple talaq came up, the Quran was mentioned and when it came to the mosque, they are forgetting the Quran
 ovaisi ne kaha ki duusare dharm ke dharmik sthal kya jaruri nahin he? unhone sawaal kiya ki nyaayalay kaise tay kar sakati he ki kya jaruri he
 Religious gurus have the right to decide this
 viechpi or aresas ke mutabik nahin chalaa ja saktaa
 He lashed out at the RSS and said that you should stay in your branch and decide when and where the temple should be built
 yah desh samvidhan ke hisaab se chalata he, na ki kisi vyakti kii dharmik bhaawanaaon ke aadhaar par
 Apart from this, Owaisi said in the special program of Aaj Tak that despite the Supreme Court saying that BJP leaders are unable to understand that this case is about the title suit and not the faith
 unhone bijepi netaa sudhanshu trivedi ke saath bahes main kaha ki bijepi kii sarkaar adaalat main kuch or kahati he, tivi bahes main kuch or chunaavon ke samay main kuch or
 Owaisi said that the arguments that the BJP leaders argue in Ayodhya should be given to the Supreme Court through the Attorney General, but they will not do so, as they know that the court does not listen to such things
 supreme court ne masjid main namaaj kii majahabi jarurat ko haashie par dhakela or udhar ayodhya main ramamandir kii ummiido ko pankh lag gaye
 Temple supporters are beginning to think that the day is not far when they will win the battle of ownership over the disputed land from the biggest court of the country
 bijepi ke liye bhi ye ummiden javaan karne vaala faisla he
 The Ram temple issue has stood in the corner of politics for decades

 The court verdict will suit the Modi government in every way
 jite to bijepi kii jeet maani jaaegi or haare to court kaa faisla bataakar pallaa jhaadne kaa rasta to khulaa hi rahegaa
 The Supreme Court has also set the date
 29 oktober se jameen par malikana haq ke cese main sunwaayee hogi
 The indications are that the country's largest court is also in the mood to settle the Ayodhya dispute soon
 desh 2019 kii chunavi dahalij par khadaa he or usase pehle ayodhya par aada koi bhi faisla kisi bhuuchaal se kam nahin hoga
 What is Ismail Farooqui case? In Ayodhya, the kar sevaks demolished the Babri Masjid on 6 December 1992
 iske baad centre sarkaar ne 7 janvari, 1993 ko adhyadesh laakar ayodhya main 67 acre jameen kaa adhigrahan kar liya tha
 Under this, 120x80 feet of disputed land was also acquired which is called Babri masjid-ram Janmabhoomi complex
 centre sarkaar ke isi faisle ko ismail faruki ne supreme court main chunauti dete hue apni yachika main kaha tha ki dharmik sthal kaa sarkaar kaise adhigrahan kar sakati he
 Hearing this, the apex court had said that offering prayers in the mosque is not an essential part of Islam

 naiku ne pravasi mazdooron or gaiyr-sthaneey kaarobaariyon ko bhi dhamkee di thi ki aisi sthiti main ve fouran kashmir chhodkar chale jaaen
 This was a major change in the 30-year-old history of terror in the state, as migrant laborers — most of whom come from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to work in the valley every year — were rarely targeted
 ve kashmiri musalamaanon ke saath rahete, jo unhen ghar kiraaye par de diya karte the
 They also include vast tracts of villages in South Kashmir, which have apple orchards and paddy fields
 naiku isi ilaake kaa rahane vaala he
 All changed after the three murders in south Kashmir's twin districts of Pulwama and Shopian after October 14 — Rajasthan truck driver Mohammad Sharif, Chhattisgarh laborer Sethi Kumar and Punjab's fruit trader Charanjit Singh
 shopiyaan ke trange gaanv ke sthaneey nivasee kehete hai ki charanjit singh unke saath kareeb ek dashak se jude the
 They used to purchase fallen apples (c-grade) every year; Never had a problem before

 On the evening of 16 October, two gunmen suddenly entered the village and surrounded a dozen migrant laborers working with them

 Kumar was battling between life and death at Sri Maharaja Hari Singh Hospital in Srinagar

 shopiyaan ke jila vikaas ayukta mohammad yaccin choudhary kehete hai ki yah 'asthaayee vyavastha' he or saamaanya vyapaar jaldi hi behaal kar diya jayega
 Apples are grown on 26,231 hectares in the district and are known as 'apple bowls' of the valley

 But he also lost a lot of runs
 jamshed ne tendulkar kii gend samaj nahin sake or unhone thodaa jaldi stroke khel diya
 The ball bounced quickly and came into Tendulkar's palm causing him to injure his finger, thus India lost the opportunity when Jamshed was on 69 runs
 hafeez ne praveen kii gend par mid aaf par ek ran lekar apana chauthaa vanade shatak jadaa
 He hit nine fours and a six in his century
 isi 33wein over main pakistan ne 200 ran puure kiye

 Farhat and Hafeez formed in Harare in 2011
 jamshed ne 104 gend kii pari main 10 chauke or ek chakka lagaaya
 Ashok Dinda bowled well in the first four overs and then lbw Hafiz with his slow ball, who hit nine fours and a six in 113 balls
 pakistan kaa score is samay do wicket par 225 ran tha
 Umar Akmal (28 runs, 24 balls) and Younis Khan (52 runs, 34 balls, six fours) added 48 runs fast, but Praveen's ball Akmal caught Gautam Gambhir in fine leg
 younis ne 34 gend main tabadatod 52 ran banaaye lekin vah raina ke ek haath se liye gayi shandaar kaich se pavilion pahunche
 Pakistan's score could reach 350 runs but the Indian bowlers stopped them in the slag overs
 bhartiya gendbaajon ke pradarshan main koi sudhaar nahin dikhaa
 Praveen proved to be the most expensive, taking two wickets for 77 runs in 10 overs while Irfan lost 69 from his quota and took one wicket
 dinda ne aath over main 47 ran dekar do wicket praapt kiye
 Ashwin's poor form continues and he took one wicket after losing 56 runs in 10 overs

 - DDA ne abhi tak yah jaankaree nahin di he ki kanvarjan charge kab tak liya jayega or is par byaaj ghataane ke liye bhi kuch nahin kaha he
 The DDA should clarify these points
 - DDA yaa nagar nigam ne jin bazaaron ko commercial ghoshit kiya hua he vahaan par kanvarjan charge nahin liya janaa chahie
 According to Master Plan 2021, till the redesignation plan of the special area is not implemented, there should be no sealing action in the special area

 The movement of buses and the rush of passengers at the Amritsar International Bus Stand adjacent to the Grand Trunk Road does not give you a chance to see and hear anything other than your journey
 yatra ke bich aapke bheetar bhi ek yatra chal rahi hoti he
 You might not be there even though you are at the International Bus Stand of Amritsar in the railway station of passengers
 kyonki aap safar par hote hai, lekin agar bich main thodaa thahar kar bas adde kii imaarat ke bare main jaanch padtaal kii to uske bare main jaanakar hairaani hui
 The reason for the surprise was that the place where buses are being caught for commuting is not a bus base building but a youth hostel for youth which has been converted into a bus station by the state government
 ek nishchit avadhi ke samjhaute ke baad kabje ko sarkari bhashaa main atikaraman kehete hai
 In fact, many youth hostels built across the country have fallen victim to encroachments to encourage the youth for the Games
 rajya sarkaron ke atikaraman ke kuch maamle aise bhi hai jinke bare main jaanakar hairaani hogi
 but it's true
 hairaani isliye ki youth hostel ko banane kii muhim europe se chalakar bharat pahunchi, lekin yahaan par hostel atikaraman kaa shikaar ho gaye
 The picture of their plight is that if the youth hostels have been handed over to the NGO on lease, then it has been converted into a bus stand
 inaki badahaali dekhne se pehle iske itihaas ke pannon ko palatnaa jaruri he taaki janaa ja sake ki yuvaaon ko rachane-bunane ke liye banaae gaye in hostalon ke liye ab tak kaa sangharsh kitna vyarth ja chukaa he
 Journey of the struggle Richard Shirraman, a German teacher, first started a campaign to set up a special hostel for the youth
 unhone khud apane dam par 1912 main hi germany ke altenia main ek yuva chatravaas kii sthapana kii thi, jahaan ve apane skool ke bacchon ko trekking ke liye protsaahit karte the
 His campaign had the effect that in 1919 Germany Youth Hostel Association was formed
 richard shirarmaan kii muhim jari rahi or uskaa nateeja yah hua ki 1932 main amestardam main international youth hostel federation ke udghaatan ke dauraan youth hostel federation conference kaa aayojan kiya gaya or isi ke saath europe main yuva chatravaason ko sthapit karne kaa chalan shuru hua
 India is also not untouched by this
 1947 main bharat-pakistan bantwaare se pehle yuva chatravaas kaa vichaar is mahadweep par dastak de chukaa tha
 The Boys Scouts and Girls Guides of India of Punjab Circle proposed for the Youth Hostel
 9 june 1945 ko shimla ke sameep tara devi main avibhajit bharat kaa pehla youth hostel sthapit kiya gaya
 It was inaugurated by the then Governor of Punjab, Sir Bertrand Glancy
 baad main bharat international youth federation kaa sadsy bana or 1956 main youth hostels association of india kii sthapana kii gai
 Impressed by its actions, the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru praised it
 bharat main dastakabaad main bharat ke kai rajyon main bhi yuva chatravaason kii sthapana hui
 The purpose of these hostels was to groom the youth and introduce them to the rich cultural heritage of the country
 inke nirmaan main centre or rajya sarkaar donon bhagidaar hoti hai
 While the central government bears the cost of their construction, the state governments provide water, power supply and road construction work
 rajya sarkaron kaa atikaramanbharat main in yuva chatravaason ko banane kaa makasad jitna khubasurat tha, ab unka prabandhan utana hi kharaab ho chukaa he
 It has fallen victim to the encroachment of the government, not anyone else
 rajya sabha kii maanav sansaadhan vikaas maamalon kii sthaayee samiti ke mutabik rajya sarkaron ne yuva chatravaason par atikaraman kiya he or ve inkaa upyog apana hit saadhane ke liye kar rahi hai
 In a report tabled in Parliament on 8 March 2018, the Standing Committee has stated that youth hostels of Yamunagar and Rewari in Haryana are being used against the objectives set for them

 However, no information about Yamunagar Youth Hostel has been given in the report
 sabase buree tasweersansadeey samiti kii report se punjab main youth hostalon kii sabase buree tasviir ubhartee he
 According to the report, youth hostels in Sangrur have been converted into itis for girls
 vahiin amritsar main bane youth hostel par rajya parivahan vibhaag ne kabja jamaa liya he, jabaki ise keval november-disambar 2005 main antarraji bas terminal ke taur par istemaal karne kii ijaajat di gai thi
 However, the transport department has neither paid the rent nor evacuated it since then
 pashchim bengal ke darjeeling main bhi ek youth hostel he, lekin use sharnaarthiyon ke liye istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 Apart from this, the university is running in the Youth Hostel of Gangtok, Sikkim
 isi tarah nagaland ke dimapur ke youth hostel ko ek enjio ko patte par de diya gaya
 At present, a private university Global Open University is operating from here
 guwahati kaa youth hostel khel vibhaag ke kabje main he

 However, given the history of encroachment on youth hostels in states like Punjab, it does not seem that they are going to get liberated so soon

 The move to send Rohingya Muslims back to their country would not only be against India's humanitarian principles and traditions but would also violate India's commitment to international law

 -input language madhya pradesh cricket association (empisie) kaa agast main hone ja rahaa chunaav raajnneeti or cricket kaa cocktail he
 The match will be between the leaders of Indore vs Gwalior, in which the captain of the Indore team is Kailash Vijayvargiya, the state's industries minister and Jyotiraditya Scindia, the Union Minister of State for Commerce is the captain of the Gwalior team
 empisie ke president pad ke liye sindhiya or indore diviginal cricket sanghathan ke adhyaksh vijayawargeey duusari baar aamane-saamne hai
 In 2010, Scindia defeated Vijayvargiya by around 70 votes
 isse pehle tak sindhiya ko association ke 240 sadasyon kaa nirvivaad samarthan miltaa rahaa tha
 But ever since Vijayvargiya took charge against him, accusations started in the association
 vijayawargeey kheme ne aarope lagaaya he ki empisie indore kii bajaae gwalior ko tarjeeh detaa he or iskaa kaaran he sindhiya kaa gwalior prem
 Says MPCA member and private secretary of Vijayvargiya, Manish Srivastava, "MPCA, which organizes matches in Indore, distributes profits from matches in all eight divisions, while Gwalior Divisional Cricket, which matches in Gwalior, takes 86 per cent dividend
 '' ve poochhate hai ki gwalior main aadharbhoot dhaanche ke liye 29 acre jameen kharidi gai to indore ke liye aisa koi prayaas kyon nahin hua?empisie ke secretary narendra menon palatwaar karte hue kehete hai, ''indore ke liye jameen to khud vijayawargeey mantri hone ke baavjood nahin dilava paa rahe
 More dividend is paid to Gwalior because of the cost of maintenance of the stadium

 The internal political equation in the MPCA election is quite interesting
 is chunavi ground par sindhiya kii tagdi fielding jami hui he or bijepi ke kuch khilaadi sindhiya kaa saath de sakate hai, jo ki vijayawargeey ke liye musiibat bharaa ho saktaa he
 When the layers of the Commonwealth scam were unraveling in Delhi, then BJP leader and BCCI Senior Vice President Arun Jaitley praised the Holkar Stadium which was redesigned by MPCA as Scindia's President
 bijepi ke purv saansad navjot singh sidghu bhi empisie kii kaaryastylee kii tarif kar chuke hai
 Scindia dominates the BCCI
 ve khud isaki finance cameti ke chairman hai to unke samarthak sanjay jagadale bisisiai ke sachiv hai
 The MPCA is dominated by Marathi speaking members
 isse bhi sindhiya ko phayda miltaa dikhataa he
 By the way, Vijayvargiya is also not leaving any chance of showing strength
 haal hi main indore diviginal cricket association ke ek kaarykram main unhone mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko aamantrit kiya, jahaan chouhan ne unki tarif ke pul baandhe
 At the moment, Scindia's pan is looking heavy

 asaram baapu ke khilaaf bolne vaale ek or gavaah kii goli maar kar hatya kar di gai
 Kripal Singh's death is not the first but the third death in this case, but it is surprising that after all, who is killing one of the important witnesses in the sexual abuse case running on Asaram Bapu
 police abhi tak is sajeesh ke mastermind kaa pataa nahin laga pai he
 But we can tell you the truth of that black night and that too through his mouth, due to which Asaram had to go to jail
 swayambhu sant asaram maamle main peedit ladki ke alphaaj aaj bhi dard main duube hue hai
 The girl's incident or say that the bitter truth of that black night has become a never-ending wound in life
 vah bataati he ki kaise 15 agast 2013 kii raat ko asaram baapu ke jodhpur ashram main bahala-phuslaa kar useasaram kii kutiyaamein le jaaya gaya
 There he was given milk to drink and then he was sexually abused by Asaram Bapu
 ladki kaa aarope he ki asaram baapu ne baad main use dhamkee di ki agar usne is baat kaa zikr kisi se bhi kiya to wo vah ladki ke mata-pita ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 Himmatlarki, who reached Shahjahanpur, told that after the incident she returned to Shahjahanpur with her parents
 shahjahanpur pahunch kar ladki main himmat ai or usne apni maa ko sari baat bataa di
 The mother told her father and then the whole family reached Delhi on 19 August 2013
 lekin asaram baapu ne parivaar se milane se manaa kar diya
 Therefore, on 20 August 2013, the girl wrote a report of sexual abuse against Baba in Kamla Market police station in Delhi
 is tarah 15 agast 2013 kii kaali raat kaa puraa sach sabake saamne aa gaya
 The police had to struggle a lot to arrest Asaram and finally on 1 September 2013, the police arrested Asaram from his Indore ashram around 12:30 pm
 bas us din se is maamle main ek baar jail jane ke baad aaj tak asaram baapu jamaanat paane ke liye adaalat main guhaar laga rahe hai
 Amritbhai Gulabchand Prajapati Asaram Bapu was a former private physician and royalist
 lekin asaram ke khilaaf adaalat main gavaahi dene ke baad 22 may 2014 ko rajkot ke clinics main gumnaam bandookdhaariyon ne unka katl kar diya
 On January 11, 2015, Asaram's former serviceman and cook Akhil Gupta was gunned down by unidentified gunmen near his home after he became a government witness against the father-son
 or ab 11 july 2015 ko kripal singh kii maut ho gai
 Kripal was attacked on July 10 with a fatal attack
 kripal singh ko bhi shahjahanpur main hamale kii raat 8 baje do motorcycle savaaron ne us vakt sarerah goli maari jab wo apane ghar waapas ja rahe the
 From there, he was referred to Bareilly, but Kripal Singh's life could not be saved
 doctoron ke mutabik, kripal ke spicel cord main chot kii vajah se unhen paralisis ho gaya tha or unke bachane kii ummid kaaphi kam thi
 According to police, Kripal Singh had named three people before he died and he is currently trying to arrest all three of them
 aage padhein, katl ke peeche kii kahani
 
 
 The Story Behind the Slaughter Akhil, the cook of Asaram, was also targeted by two people who came on the bike in Muzaffarnagar in the same way as Kripal Singh was made
 to kya asaram ke khilaaf munh kholane vaale sabhi gavaahon par hamale kaa bilkul ek jaisaa ye tarika bhi mahaj ittefaq he? yaa phir ishaara kuch or he?kabhi asaram or uske bete narayan sai ke liye rasoiye kaa kaam chukaa akhil gupta in dinon apane home toun mujffanagar main hi rahata tha
 He lived with these father and son for about ten years, but then after marrying a girl there, he returned to his home Muzaffarnagar
 iske baad wo yaheen rah kar deyari kaa kaarobaar kar rahaa tha, lekin janvari kii ek raat kareeb paune aath baje jab wo scooter par apane ghar laut rahaa tha
 Suddenly some assailants on the bike shot him from behind and took advantage of the darkness and escaped
 baad main akhil ko aspataal le jaaya gaya, lekin tab tak uski maut ho chuki thi
 In fact, Akhil had been accused of rape with Asaram and Narayan Sai after the complaint of two sisters from Surat, because Akhil also allegedly supported them in the father-son act
 akhil kii jindagi main nayaa mode aayaa 19 oktober 2013 ko jab achaanak gujarat police use saath mujffarnagar se apane saath surat le gai
 After questioning the police there, he agreed to testify against Asaram and Narayan Sai
 usne apane bayaan bhi darj karwaae, lekin isse pehle ki adaalat faisla karti, akhil gupta kaa katl kar diya gaya
 Something similar was the second slaughter, Amrit Prajapati was also sitting in his clinic on Pedak Road, Rajkot
 tabhi do anjaan shaks clinics main daakhil hue or un par goliyaan chalaa di thim
 Although he was rushed to the hospital immediately, he died during treatment
 prajapati bhi asaram baapu par chal rahe yon shoshan maamle ke ahm gavaah the, lekin hairaani kii baat ye he ki police aaj tak unke kaatilon ko nahin dhundh pai he
 It was midday
 22 may 2014 ko rajkot main vaidya amrit prajapati kaa rajkot ke pedak road par apni clinics omshanti main baithe the
 Then two unknown persons enter the clinic and two abusers Prajapati from close range
 ek goli kaan ko chhu kar nikal jaati he jabaki duusari chehre par lagati he
 The attackers escape after being shot, but Prajapati dies while undergoing treatment in the hospital
 prajapati kii maut koi maamuli maut nahin he
 It is a murder that was carried out in a very frightening manner and the second creator was the person who first exposed the deeds of Asaram such as solitude, punche booties and sexual exploitation
 lekin isse bhi zyada ahm baat ye ki prajapati asaram ke khilaaf sabase ahm gavaah the

 Legislation has become law After President Ram Nath Kovind passed both the houses of Bills Parliament, this bill has been approved and now it has become law
 lekin purvottar main iske khilaaf pradarshan jari he
 People are taking to the streets in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and demanding the withdrawal of this law
 beete do dinon main pradarshan ne kai baar hinsak rup bhi liya he, railway stesan ko aag lagaai gai
 Vehicles were also attacked

 Internet was also shut down As a precaution, the Central Government has stopped internet-sms in Assam, Tripura and Meghalaya
 assam ke das jilon main 24 ghante, tripura-meghalaya main 48 ghante ke liye internet band hai
 On Friday, some curfew was relaxed in Guwahati, Dibrugarh, so that people could get the necessities
 america lekhak tom clanji ne likhaa he, “meraa maananaa he ki sex duniya kii sabase khubasurat, prakritik or mukammal sukh dene vaali aisi cheez he jise paise se kharida ja saktaa he
 Bollywood has taken lessons from these lines of Tom
 tom ne yah baat bhale kisi or sandarbh main kahi ho lekin bollywood kaa pichhlaa report card dekhen to yah siddh ho jaataa he ki bhartiya darshakon main bhi aisa tabaka taiyaar ho gaya he jo paisa dekar parde par sex kamedi yaa irotic thriller dekhne ja rahaa he
 Such a plant is also being prepared in Bollywood, which wants to make films of the same genre
 phir vah chaahe pritish nandi kii beti rangita nandi hon yaa phir senior filmmekar indra kumaar yaa irotic kii queen kahi jane vaali produsar ekta kapur
 Sunny Leone, who has become a name in Hindi films from porn star to Bollywood's popularity in the genre of erotic films, has announced, "2016 will be the year of adult comedies
 ” unhone yah baat yun hi nahin kahi he
 Two adult comedies are being released in the first month of the year
 22 janvari ko kya kool hai ham siries kii teesri film or 29 janvari ko sani leyoni kii mastijade
 In this way, a genre of erotic films has been prepared in which not only the producers are making good money but also for those actors, whose career in mainstream films could not get back on track and then such new people There are also those who are looking for an opportunity to start a career in Bollywood
 girte kariyar ko uthanjis samaaj main sex ko varjana samajha jaataa ho vahaan aise koun-se sitare hai jo is johnor kii filmein kar rahe hai? is baat ko daiji shah kii misaal se bhi samajha ja saktaa he
 He said after the hit of his erotic thriller Hate Story-3, "if i had got good offers after Jai Ho, i would not have done Hate Story-3
 ” yah irotic filmon se judi varjana hi thi, jisaki vajah se unhone aisa kaha kyonki unhone bollywood main apane kariyar kii shuruyaat jai ho (2014) se superstar salmaan khan ke saath kii thi
 He could not get a good chance after that
 haalanki unhone yah bhi mana, “hit story-3 karnaa meraa sahi faisla tha
 "there was a similar story for Zarine Khan, who played a draped princess in 2010 with Veer in Salman Khan, but by 2015, she had to choose a bold style in Hate Story-3
 unhone apni madamast adaaon se darshakon ke dilon par chhuriyaan chalaayin or het story frenchiji kaa kamyaabi kaa safar jari rakhaa
 He said, “to be honest, if i had to do a film without lovemaking or kissing, it would be a religious film
 ”shilpa shukla kaa bhi aisa hi maamla he
 B
 e
 Paas had a good film, which was challenging for any heroine to associate with
 lekin chak de! (2007) se bollywood main pahchaan banane vaali shilpa ko phir se khud kii pahchaan kaayam karne kaa mauka bi
 a
 paas kii sexi antee se hi mila
 Tusshar Kapoor, Veeradas and Aftab Shivdasani are names that continue their journey in Bollywood on the basis of adult comedies
 tushaar kapur kya kool hai ham siries kii do safal filmein kar chuke hai
 Aftab's luck also clicked again from adult comedy Grand Masti (2013) and this year his two adult comedies Kyaa Kool Hain Hum-3 and Great Grand Masti will be released
 is tarah yah johnor kariyar kii nai raahen khol rahaa he
 Vishal Pandya, director of Hate Story-3, says, "in every Hate Story film, such heroines were chosen who had not tried this genre before
 content kii vajah se filmein chali bheen
 ”he also believes that big stars avoid trying these films in the image
 nae sitare or videshi kudissandeji shah ne haal hi main kaha tha, “bhartiya filmon main sex pichley das saal se bik rahaa he
 If the film does not have a big star, then such a spice is needed to run the film
 log theatron main manoranjan ke liye aa rahe hai, ve motaa paisa kharch kar rahe hai or unhen bold content kii jarurat he
 Leaving Imran Khan in Dehli Bailey, the entire starcast was brand new
 isi tarah apane bold mahila paatro kii vajah se hit hone vaali het story main pauli dam ne boldnes kii hadein paar kii thim to duusare part main surveen chawla ne yah bidaa uthaaya
 In this way all the female characters of Grand Masti, be it Karisma or Bruna Abdullah or Maryam - were very new to Bollywood
 great grand masti kii heroine sonaali raut or urvashi rotela bhi bollywood main ek film hi puraani hai
 Sonali had done a lot of exposure in Himesh Reshammiya's expose, and made headlines
 ekta kapur ke production kii ek or film tripal eks ke stars ke contract main to neudity cloj tak jod di gai he
 Meanwhile, in Vikram Bhatt's Love Games Patralekha (citylights) and Tara Alisha Berry (mastram) have done only one film each
 ek film visheshgy kehete hai, “aksar bade sitare irotic johnor se duuri banaakar rakhte hai, unhen lagata he ki is tarah kii film se ve tipcast ho sakate hai, or unase aage bhi isi tarah kii maang kii ja sakati he jabaki yuva sitaron ko brake chahie hota he
 If the director is large
 binar bada he to ve is tarah kaa jokhim uthaa lete hai
 The magic of the foreign skin remains intact
 bharatiyon ko hameshaa se videshi baalaon kaa craij rahaa he
 Bollywood is the biggest witness of this, where every second or third Friday such a film is released in which a new foreigner is launched
 yahi hasinaayen irotic filmon kaa cheharaa ban rahi hai
 Jism-2 or Mastijade's Sunny Leone or Ya Kya Kool Hai Hum-3's Mandana Karimi and Grand Masti have Bruna Abdullah (brazilian model) and Maryam Zakaria (swedish-iranian)
 mastijade kii produsar rangita nandi bhi apni film kii euaspy sani leyoni ko hi bataati hai
 Changed Warp: Until almost two decades ago, the morning shows were places to watch erotic movies
 par internet ke kadam rakhane ke saath hi yah saamagree logon kii jad main aa gai or hollywood kii american paai se lekar anya bhashaaon kii bold filmein sabhi ke liye uplabdh ho gayi
 In this way, the trial started in Bollywood too
 shuru main menstream heroinon ne isamen haath aajamaane kii koshish bhi kii
 An example of this is a short love story (2002) by Manisha Koirala
 jisamen ek kishor apane se doguni umr kii ladki ke mohpash main funs jaataa he
 On the other hand, Bipasha Basu did wonders with Jism (2003) and Neha Dhupia in Julie (2004) also gave wings to the imagination of the audience
 haalanki bade sitaron ke saath khatra tipcast hone kaa ban jaataa he, jisaki shikaar neha dhoopiya aage chalakar huin
 Girlfriend (2004), a lesbian relationship between two girls, flopped due to a weak script, while the remake of Malika Sehrawat's The Unfulfilled Murder Superhit this year
 2011 aate-aate edlt kamedis ke is johnor ne dehali beli ke saath majboot kadam jamaa liye
 The fact remained from the beginning that the film could not be played on the basis of weak story or frivolity
 rangita bhi isse ittefaq rakhti hai, “maine milaap jhaveri ko film kii script sunne ke liye 10 minute die the
 In those 10 minutes, i was in a bad mood
 agar film kharaab hogi to log ek hi baar dekhenge lekin kahani main dam hoga to baar-baar dekhenge
 That is why a weak story film like Guddu Ki Gun released in 2015 fell flat at the box office while Hunter (2015) won the hearts of the audience
 kehete hai “jo dikhataa he vah bikta he
 "this is true of this genre and it is happening
 par ise tikne ke liye majboot kahani kaa daaman thame rakhana hoga
 The rural areas of Jharkhand these days are wrapped in the specter of superstition

 - Sumit kadel (@sumitkadei) October 31, 2019 Hot mood may be Shah Rukh's character According to a source, the film's makers are confident about the name of the film as a freak
 shahrukh is film main ek garm dimag or gussell shaks kaa kirdaar nibhaa sakate hai or isliye ye tital film ko suut karata he
 The film's team can announce this on Shahrukh's birthday
 isse pehle shahid kapur ne bhi south diarector sandip wanga ke saath kaam kar kabir singh jaisi blockbster film di thi
 This film has proved to be the biggest film of Shahid's career
 shahid ne bhi ek gussell or kreji medical profeshnal kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa tha
 While Atlee's fans were congratulating him for working with Shah Rukh, many fans are believing that with this film, Lagesha Rukh may finally find success in his quest for a superhero
 shahrukh khaanne isse pehle anand el raay ke saath kaam kiya tha
 Despite stars like Shah Rukh, Anushka and Katrina, the film did not earn much at the box office
 nrutyaangna sonal maansingh, shehanai ke shahenshaah ustad bismillah khan, thumari gayika girija devi or sur samraji lata mangeshkar par charchit kitaaben likhane ke baad begum akhtar par sampadit apni kitaab 'akhtari: soz or saz kaa afasaana' saath yatindra mishra ek baar phir charchaa main hai
 The book of Yatindra Mishra's writing is quite extensive
 bahuvidh vishyon ke parkhi is lekhak ne apane shodhaparakh lekhan kii dhak keval hindi main hi nahin samooche bhartiya sahitya par chodi he
 His books written or edited include essays on demonstrative stories 'vismay Ka Bakhan', 'kunwar Narayana: Sansar', 'kunwar Narayan: Presence' and 'many Times' on poet Kunwar Narayan, 'beauty of Art' in four volumes

 unke dwaara geetkaar gulzaar kii kavitaayen evam film geeton ke chayan 'chaar julahe' tathaa 'milon se din' naam se sampadit hai
 His 4 poetry collections have been published under the names 'yadakada', 'ayodhya and other poems', 'diyodhi Par Alap' and 'vibhas'
 ayodhya ke sangithik itihaas par 'ayodhya kii sangeet parampara' tathaa faijabad ke itihaas, samskruti evam samaaj par saanskrithik gajetir ke rup main 'shaharnama' naamak kitaab ke alaava 'agyeyah jitna tumhaara sach he', bhi prakashit ho chuke hai

 ‘sahitya ajtak’ ne 'akhtari: soz or saz kaa afasaana' par yatindra mishra se lambii baatcheet kii
 Excerpts: 1
 sur or sangeet ke sadhak aapke mukhya vishay rahe hai? isaki vajah?yatindra mishrah yah sahi he ki idhar ke varshon main maine sangeet ke saadhakon ke jivan or unki kala ko apane lekhan kaa vishay banaaya he
 This has been done spontaneously
 isliye bhi ki mujhe lagata he ki kalaon or libral arts ke kshetra ke mahatvapurn kalakaaron kii sadhana par vistaar se kaam hona chahie
 That needs to be done not only by writing, but also through audio-video medium
 sangeet saadhakon par likhnaa meraa priy kaam rahaa he
 i am a music lover, i try to understand the nuances of it and try to find taste in it and express it by writing, which in a broad sense causes the taste of common people
 isliye likhakar pathakeey samaaj main sangeet va kalaon ke bare main utsukata jagaane kii koshish bhar karata hoon
 2
 sangeet or sur ke saadhakon ke nijee jivan or unki srijan yatra main aap ko koun zyada aakarshith karata he?yatindra mishrah yah kahana thodaa mushkil he ki nizi jivan zyaada aakarshith karata he yaa ki srijan yatra
 In a way, you will find that both are complementary to each other
 kabhi jivan main se srijan jhaankata he or kabhi srijan ke bahaane ham jivan ke prati us kalakaar kii drushti ko pakad pate hai
 If i talk about the example of my book, i would like to say in the context of 'lata: sur-gatha' that i wrote a book on Lata Mangeshkar ji covering the same part of her life, which is somewhere her musical struggle , Told the story of his grooming process and his flourishing in that art
 jo chizein jivan se sambandhit thim or unka koi bahut gaharaa sambandh sidhe unke sangeet se nahin judata tha, use maine nahin likhaa
 So in this way you can say that if there was an internal relationship between the two, then it would work for both my writer and the reader
 keval vyaktigat zindagi, phir vah kisi kii bhi kyon na ho, samaaj or duniya ke liye har str par jaanane kii baat nahin hai
 Privacy also has dignity, which should be maintained as soon as possible
 pustak ansh- akhtari: soz or saz kaa afasaana; daastaan malikaa-e-ghazal kii3
 You have written books on such personalities as Ustad Bismillah Khan, Girija Devi, Lata Mangeshkar and Sonal Mansingh
 begum akhtar ko inke bich aap kahaan pate hai?yatindra mishrah main khushnaseeb hoon ki mujhe ustad bismilla khaan, lata mangeshkar, girija devi or sonal maansingh jaise bade kalakaaron par kuch kaam karne kaa mauka mila
 i accept from every platform that a greater experience than writing a book on all these has been to go through the creation process which was achieved due to the respect of these idols
 ‘lata : sur-gaatha’ jaisi pustak bahut padhi or saraahi gayi, yah mere liye behad khushi kii baat he
 
 
 
 magar isse badi baat mere us jivananubhav kii bhi he, jo maine aadarniya lata ji ke saath, saat-aath saalon tak baat karte hue guzaarin or unke nazadik rahakar parshvagayan kii duniya kii rochak kahaniyaan sunin
 Amidst all this, i find the story of Begum Akhtar Sahiba equally interesting, inspiring and meaningful
 unka jis tarah kaa jivan tha or tawaayph parampara se upar uthakar kis tarah vah begum banane kaa qirdaar akhtiyaar karti hai, use jaananaa ek had tak us daur ke saamaajik, rajnatik dhaanche ko bhi samajhnaa he
 Today he is getting more than forty five years, and in these fifty years, his fame has increased
 unako sunne or unki tarah gane vaali ek puri peedi hi maujuud he or lagaataar nayi peedi bhi usamen shaamil ho rahi he
 In such a situation, the task of collecting their memories and handing over their heritage to the new generation seemed to be an important thing
 hindi main durbhaagya se vah ab tak hua bhi nahin tha
 Because of this, i found it relevant to work on Begum Akhtar
 4
 Tell us something about the book 'akhtari: Soz and Saaz Ka Afsana? Yatindra Mishra: This book has been edited by researching the life of Begum Akhtar
 isamen is baat kaa vishesh dhyaan rakhaa gaya ki unki sangithik-yatra or jivan se sambandhit un sari chizon par ek vimarsh taiyaar kiya jaae, jisase akhtaribai faizaabadi se begum akhtar tak ke lambe safar kaa jayja liya ja sake
 In addition to my own articles and comments, articles have been written by experts in music and Begum Akhtar, including Iqbal Rizvi, Dr
 rakhshanda zaleel, kunal re, saleem kidawai, shila dhar, dow
 Scholars such as Praveen Jha and Mamta Kalia are included
 sangeet jagat ke dheron bade fanakaaron ne bhi yahan begum sahiba ke liye kalam chalaayi he
 Among these, one can read the comments of Shruti Sadolikar, Shubha Mudgal, Aneesh Pradhan, Kaumudi Munshi, Malini Awasthi etc
 saath hi unki do pramukh shishyaaon se lambi baatcheet bhi pustak kaa aakarshan he, jinamein shanti hiranand ji or reeta ganguli ke naam liye ja sakate hai
 To a lesser extent, 'akhtari: Soz and Saaz Ka Afsana' is a historical text-like document on the life of Begum Akhtar in the face of Dastangoi, with the story of his becoming malika-e-ghazal
 5
 Writing on Begum Akhtar, what influenced you most of her life? Yatindra Mishra: The aspect of Begum Akhtar Sahiba's life that impressed me the most is her liberated life
 kis tarah pichhali shatabdi ke purvarddh main ek gayika or film abhinetri apni shaksiyat ke belos andaaj, shystagi, udaartaa or kalakaari ke chalate ek bade qirdaar main dhalati he, use padhanaa or samajhnaa us daur ke saanskrithik va raajnneetik sandarbhon ko jaanane kii tarah tha
 In light of all these things, i see Begum Akhtar as a great funkar and equally big human being
 ise pakadaney kii hi koshish maine kii he
 6
 yah kitaab kin logon ke liye upyogi he?yatindra mishrah yah qitaab sirf sangeet-premiyon yaa begum akhtar ke kadradaanon ke liye hi upyogi nahin he
 i think those interested in history and social science will also like 'akhtari'
 ek vishesh daur main hue kisi vishisht charitra ko lekar bune gayi sandarbhon ke tahat likhi gayi qitaaben us daur kaa bhi sansmaran bataati hai
 They are documents of that history
 yahi haal ‘akhtari’ kaa bhi he
 a singer can be discourse in a larger historical perspective by recording her time in the same way as a feudal, Nawab, a soldier or warrior, social reformer, political people, spiritual saint and actor-actress, etc

 ) a prominent US lawmaker has made an amendment proposal in the Senate, which proposes to stop foreign aid to countries that have borrowed at least $ 10 billion from the US
 agar yah prastaavit paarit ho jaataa he, to isse china, bharat, brazil or rus jaise desh prabhavit ho sakate hai
 Senator Tom Coburn said that borrowing from countries that seek financial help from us is fatal to both the donor and the recipient of the donation
 agar ve desh hamase rin lene main sakasham hai, to ve khud vittiya madad kaarykram kii vyavastha kar sakate hai
 At the same time, when we borrow from the countries that we are helping, our budget is affected
 isse ek-duusare par nirbharta or vittiya jokhim badhata he
 The senator said that the US government gave 16 countries 1
 4 arab dollar videshi madad di he or inamen china or rus samet prayek desh par america kaa kam se kam 10 arab dollar kaa karj he
 He said the amendment would save US taxpayers more than a billion dollars this year, otherwise it would have to borrow money from China or Russia and then return it

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke 'svachh bharat mishan' se bhala koun anjaan he? shahar or gaanvon ko svachh rakhane ke liye centre sarkaar ghar-ghar shauchalayon kaa nirmaan karvaa rahi he
 a film titled 'toilet Ek Prem Katha' has also come up on this subject, in which actor Akshay Kumar is seen motivating people for the cleanliness campaign
 haalankibiharke supaul main toilat ek prem katha nahin, balki 'toilet ek gadar katha' ban gai
 Actually, the officers got entangled over the toilet in the morning from an elderly person here
 ab sawaal yah he ki aakhir shauchalay ke naam se adhikari bhadak kyon gaye?ji haa, swatchta abhiyaan kii aad main ek adhikari ek bujurg or ekanaballighse gaali-galouj karata he or uthak baithak karwaata he

 adhikari subah-subah round par nikalataa he or ek bujurg ko khet se aate hue dekh letaa he
 His lota also gets seized
 adhikari bujurg se poochta he ki usne shauchalay kyon nahin banwaaya? iskaa jawaab dete hue bujurg kahata he ki ghar main kaam chal rahaa he
 It will be completed in three to four days, but you give the money

 After this, the policemen accompanying the officer get a sit-down and slap the child
 is bich koi is ghatana kaa puraa video bana letaa he or soshal media par viral kar detaa he
 Now we wanted to know whether it really happened? So we did a viral test and went straight to Supaul to investigate the video

 To verify the veracity of this viral video, our correspondent contacted Officer DCLR Akhilesh Prasad Verma and District Magistrate of Supaul District, but no one agreed to discuss the matter
 aise main sawaal ye uthta he ki kya afasaron kii aisi budtameezi se bharat svachh hoga
 If DCLR Akhilesh Prasad Verma was not convinced of the elderly, then why did he not go to his house to check? In this way, this news proved to be true in the viral test

 somvaar ko dilli main pakistan ke ucchayukta nepakistan diwasapar jis tarah se kashmiri algaavvaadiyon ko tarjeeh di or unka jamkar swaagat kiya uski jitani bhi ninda kii jaae, kam he
 Knowing and believing that Kashmir is a matter between the two countries, Pakistan gave so much importance to Kashmiri separatists

 Earlier, the US and European countries did not believe this allegation to be true, but they have also seen how Pakistan's spy agency ISI is training and sending terrorists to Kashmir
 samay aa gaya he ki pakistan apni phaltu kism kii karravaaiyaan band kare or gambhirtha se bharat ke saath rishte sudhaarney kii koshish kare
 For this, it is necessary that he should stop singing the ragas and take the path of peace
 mutthibhar tuchche algaavvaadiyon ko apana yahaan khaas mehmaan banaakar vah koi acha sanket nahin de rahaa he
 It would have been better if he had seriously given India a chance to negotiate and tried to make the occasion memorable, but he had missed this opportunity
 ab aage kaa rasta kathin he
