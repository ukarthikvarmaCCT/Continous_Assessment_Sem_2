 While some officers of the Air Force were seen angry about the helicopter crash, some tried to overcome their anger

 But he came home
 or thik 15 din baad khabar ai kipulice encountermen phurkan maaraa gaya
 Police forgery? However, the police claimed that Furkan was involved in several robberies in Saharanpur, Shamli and Muzaffarnagar
 
 Then the family members are asking the question that if Furqan was in jail for seven years, then how can he join these robberies? And why did the policemen come to negotiate with him for his release
 jab wo uskaa encounter hi karnaa chaahate the?kya phurkan ko bali kaa bakra banaaya gaya
 This question is also because such accusations are not just by the family members of Furkan, but there is a good list of those who make such allegations

 magar us chakkar main police sarkari qatl karne lage, ye kahaan kaa insaaf he
 Therefore, the questions being raised on the encounters in UP are also valid
 encounter par kyon uth rahe hai sawaal?saare maamalon main exiaar kaa pattern ek jaisaa hi he, badmaash bhaag rahe the, police ke rokane par firing ho gai or javaabi karrwai main badmaash maare gaye

 Dear Politics, Today's letter is not a love letter
 ye patr koi milane kaa pataa bataane yaa tumhaare haalchaal ko jaanane ke liye bhi nahin he
 
 
 This letter is rather an apology ab tum soch rahi hogi kii maafinama kyon? bahut baari dil ke saath main tumse dur ja rahaa hum, main ab tumhen saamaajik taur par sweekaar nahin kar saktaa
 My heart only knows that my love for you and yours is immortal, but i am a man bound in social circles
 ye samaaj ab mujhe tumse prem nahin karne de rahaa he
 People have started saying that politics has become dirty now
 
 
 
 See, being dirty is not a sin, yes, if you did not take different angle cameras while bathing in the Ganges, then the pressure of society would not come on me
 ab koi ek martabaa kii baat ho to mai bhi use aayaa-gaya kar duun, lekin tumhen lekar to roj yahi baat hoti he ki tum din-ba-din gandi hoti chali ja rahi ho
 Now tell me that my parents are equal, brothers are equal, but you did not leave them too, just to attract a few people, you tried to cook their jabanji in the pan like a desi gourd
 ye baat mere dil ko lagi
 My dear politics, you were not like this before! From the 50s to the 80s, there have been innumerable stories of your honesty and self-respect, reading these fell in love with you
 main tumhen is kadar chaahane laga tha ki main hameshaa khud ko tumhaare ird-gird rakhana chahta tha , raat ko jab ghar lautataa to tumhaare hi kisse hote the, log to mujhe aisa majanu samajhane lage the jo din-raat apni laila kaa naam japta hi rahata tha
 Now see what the society has started to say about you? To be honest, i am a common man who will be sucked like a mango and thrown away, but your relevance will never diminish
 par dekho, tum ghabraana mat, main abhi keval tumse dur janaa chahta hum, or dur hone kaa matlab ishk kaa mar janaa nahin ho saktaa na! sachai to ye he ki main tumse nahin, jehar kii us kheti ke ird-gird main nahin rah saktaa jahaan chand log vot kii khatir khooni hinsa par uthaaru ho jaaen

 ab bataao tumhaari lat kuch aisi lagi ki raajnneeti ke rajkumaar ke log desh ke pradhanpant kaa sammaan tak karnaa bhul gaye
 
 
 Yes, everyone should follow the dignity of the language, but those who are eager to ride your way to the 7 Lok Kalyan Marg, there is no system of restraint; And i believe that love or hostility should be everywhere
 ab dekho naa, main bhi to dhiraj dhar kar ye brallep kaa lav-letters likh rahaa hum
 See, i did not have the heart to go away from you, but what should i do now, for your sake, a Shikhar Purush known as Vikas Purush in Bihar has started a unique phase of breakup and patchup
 isse tumhaari vishwasaneeyata khatre main aa gai he or tum par yakeen karnaa bada hi mushkil ho gaya he
 Look, if there was one occasion, Shikwa would have overcome this hesitation by stuttering, but even in Delhi, there is a king Babu who has made such records of hitting U-turn, which broke the heart of the people
 ab dekho, meraa dil koi radar to he nahin, jo tumhaari mrug-marichika sareekhe ishk ke badalon se dhokhaa kha jaae
 i want to distance myself from you in time so that my common man's marmalade cannot be eaten by making another pimples
 he meri priy raajnneeti, main tumse ishk karata tha, karata hum or karata rahoonga, lekin ye jaisaa maine tumse pehle bhi kaha tha ki main bechaara bas main dhakke khaakar roj 10 se 7 kii naukari karne vaala aam aadmi hum, jiskaa kabhi koi mobile chin letaa he, to kabhi koi purse maar letaa he
 
 
 In such a situation, my love for you can be immortal by staying in the midst of society, but cannot live with it, so now i am beginning to put mud on this relationship from today
 tumhaara aashiq,jo ab tumhaare saath nahin he

 dakshin america ke ek desh main neshnal guard ke 81 saal puure hone ke maukey par khaas kaarykram chal rahaa tha
 The President was giving a fiery speech to encourage the security guards of his country
 tabhi achaanak aasmaan se udati hui koi chiz raashtrapati ke nazadik aati he
 Then suddenly there is a loud blast in the air before anyone knows something
 dhamaakaa hote hi maukey par afra-tafari much jaati he
 The President's security guards immediately take the President in his circle
 par ye hawa main hua tha kya? iskaa khulaasa tab hota he jab raashtrapati ke saamne se bullate pruf kavach hataaya jaataa he
 On 4 August 2018, 5:41 pm, a ceremony was held to mark 81 years of the National Guard in Caracas, Venezuelarajadhani Caracas
 mukhya atithi ke taur par khud venezuela ke raashtrapati nicholas maduro neshnal gards kaa haunsala badhaane ke liye pahunche the
 The grand ceremony was being broadcast live on the national channel
 puure mulk kii nazar raashtrapati ke bhaashan par thi kyonki pichley ek arse se mulk kii haalat bad se badtar ho rahi he or raashtrapati nicholas ko apane upar lage tamaam aaropon kaa jawaab dena tha
 Wearing a golden chain and a tricolor around the neck, President Joshua was giving a speech
 ki tabhi achaanak thik raashtrapati ke upar aasmaan main ek dhamaakaa hua
 Attack on President by drone! The National Guards took over the situation
 angrakshakon ne raashtrapati ke saamne human shield bana di
 And on the other side, thousands of guards started running from the path on which the parade was going
 gards kaa yun bhaagna sena main acha nahin mana jaataa
 So the national channel immediately stopped airing
 sawaal ye tha ki aakhir aisa kya hua ki shuruuaat main jiske dhamaake kii awaz to sunai di magar kuch dikhaai nahin diya
 Or did not really understand what happened
 ye hamalaa raashtrapati ko nishaanaa banane ke makasad se kiya gaya tha or samaj main isliye nahin aayaa kyonki ye hawa main kisi udati hui chiz se kiya gaya tha
 Which was a drone
 rashtradhyaksh par pehla drone ataikayah kisi rashtradhyaksh par duniya kaa pehla drone atake tha
 President Nicholas was attacked by an explosive-laden drone
 ise venezuela main ab tak kaa sabase bada raajnneetik hamalaa mana ja rahaa he
 It was just a little while giving a speech
 ki dhamaake kii awaz ne sabko daraa diya
 The camera was shaken by the explosion and the eyes of all the guests looking towards the army parade got stuck in the sky
 aasmaan main jo dikhaai diya wo kisi ke samaj main nahin aayaa
 Just at one place black smoke appeared
 raashtrapati ko angrakshakon ne gheridhar, neshnal gards bullate pruf cover kholkar raashtrapati ke saamne khadey ho gaye taaki unhen koi nuksaan naa ho
 But neither the guards understand, nor does President Nicholas know from which side the attack took place and where to escape
 lihaaza unhen har taraf se cover kar liya gaya
 The fear was that no attackers could take advantage of the blast and start firing from the front
 dhamaake se imaaraton main lagi agcamare kii duusari tasviir main bhi isi tarah kii afratfari nazar ai jab dhamaake kii awaz sunakar darshakon samate sainik bhi bhaag khadey hue
 a fire broke out in the surrounding building where the drone exploded
 dhamaake kii vajah se khidakiyon ke shishe tut gaye
 The President was immediately escorted by the National Guard personnel from the venue to Mahfouz
 7 sainik ghayal, 6 sandigdh giraftaarashtrapati nicholas par kiye gaye is hamale main 7 sainik ghayal ho gaye hai
 But it is not yet clear who attacked
 sirf itnaa bataaya gaya he ki drone visphotak se bharaa hua tha or ise remote control se oparate kiya ja rahaa tha
 However, six people have been arrested in this drone attack case
 kai gadiyon ko jabt kiya gaya he, jabaki rajdhani caracas main kai hotalon par chaape bhi maare gaye hai
 Also, there may be many more arrests ahead
 charampanthi guton par hamale kaa aropakhud venezuela ke raashtrapati nicholas maduro ne iske liye charampanthi guton or colombia ke nivartmaan raashtrapati juaan minial santos ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 Nicholas said "I have been attacked for the purpose of killing
" mujhe isamen koi shaq nahin he ki is hamale se jude sabhi pahalu bataate hai ki iske peeche venezuela or colombia kii dakshinpanthi takatein or colombian raashtrapati khuaan minial santos hai
 "opposition reported- President's stunt, although Venezuela's opposition parties say that it is the President's stunt, who are trying to hide their failure in this way
 or hamadardi batorna chaahate hai
 Let me tell you that Venezuela is currently going through its worst phase
 arthvvastha se lekar samaajik suraksha tak ke har maamle main sarkaar naakaam nazar aa rahi he
 Because of which many rebel organizations within the country have turned against the President
 mumkin he ki is hamale ke peeche unka haath ho
 The attack also took place last year, according to a news, the responsibility of the attack has been taken by an organization called National Movement of Soldiers in Tshirt
 magar suraksha agenciyon ko aise koi saboot nahin mili
 It is feared that foreign forces may be involved in this
 aapako bataa den ki isse pehle june 2017 main venezuela kii supreme court par ek helicopter se bam giraae gaye the
 The helicopter pilot Oscar Perez appealed to Venezuelan citizens to take a stand against Maduro
 jise baad main maar diya gaya tha

 Tamang made his stand in the meeting with the Chief Election Commissioner and the two commissioners in the Election House
 tamang ne kaha ki wo 27 may ko mukhyamantri niyukt hue hai
 He has to be elected and come to the assembly within six months
 lekin bhrashtachar ke maamle main wo sajayaftaa hone se chunaav ladane ke yogya nahin hai
 If the commission does not lift the ban on his contesting elections, he will have to resign
 tamang 1990 ke dashak main pashupaalan mantri rahete hue ‘gaay vitaran yojana’ main sarkari dhan ke durupyog karne kaa doshi paaya gaya tha
 He was also convicted of crimes of breach of trust, criminal conspiracy and gross misuse of his position while serving as a government servant
 iske baad 2017 se 2018 tak vah ek saal jail main rahe the
 He was released from jail on August 10, 2018

 Further, under Section 11 of 1951, the Election Commission has the power to remove or reduce the period of disqualification
 yahi kaaran he ki tamang ne chunaav ayog se 30 sitambar tak unki ayogyata avadhi par faisla lene ko kaha he
 Tamang's party Sikkim Kranti Morcha (SKM) had defeated the Sikkim Democratic Front in the state assembly elections and ended 5 consecutive terms of rule

 lekin in nateezon kii samiksha main lage bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko abhi se bhavishya ke sawaal ghere hue hai
 In his first press talk, if any question was repeatedly surrounded him, then what will be the party's strategy in Uttar Pradesh, will the party give the face of the Chief Minister? Amit Shah's answer was that the time will come
 amit shah ke is ofishal jawaab ke peeche chintaa kii wo lakeer saaf dekhi ja sakati he jo party ke har netaa ke chehre parauttar pradesh chunaavka naam aate hi gahari ho jaati he
 The party which won the state's record 72 seats in the Modi wave is now looking for a formula for the assembly elections that can defeat Mayawati and Samajwadi Party
 chunaav se pehle party mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa saamne lahosam kii jeet party ke liye kai sabak lekar ai he
 In Delhi, the party suffered the loss of the face of the Chief Minister before the elections and he contested the elections on the face of Modi and Amit Shah in Bihar, the result is in front of everyone

 BJP has started exploring the face of the party in UP after learning from Assam
 party aise netaa kii talash main he jo bahanji yani mayawati ko takkar de sake or jatigat sameekaran bhi bitha sake
 Giving responsibility to Smriti Irani, Mahesh Sharma, Yogi Adityanath is only part of this strategy
 sthaneey netaaon kii andekhi naa hoparty upi main sthaneey netaaon ko tavajjo dene kii ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he
 Party state president Keshav Prasad Maurya has emphasized this fact in the announcement of the district presidents
 har zile main jati ke aadhaar par aise netaaon ko chunaa gaya jo party ke kaam main barason se lage hai
 Not only this, senior leaders Kalyan Singh and Rajnath Singh were also given space so that factionalism could be controlled
 assam kaa sandesh: prachaar kii style main ho badlarhsam main party ne sthaneey muddon ko aage rakhaa
 There was a rhetoric against Bangladeshi infiltrators, but care was taken that polarization could not take place
 bijepi bangladeshi muslimon ko bhartiya muslimon se alag kar dikhaati rahi
 The party will try to adopt this lesson in UP
 mandal kamandal ke naare ke saath-sathvikas or centreke kaamkaaj par janata ke bich jaaya jaae
 These signs have also been started by Amit Shah
 gutbaji par lage lagaasam kii tarah upi main bhi andruni gutbaji par party ko lagaam lagaana hoga
 The differences between Sarbananda Sonowal and Hemant Biswa Sarma are not hidden from anyone, but the strategy in the state is designed so that the ambition of the two does not outweigh the party

 Will you remember Asaram Bapu? Yes, the same Asaram Bapu who has been inside the jail for more than a quarter of a year
 yon shoshan ke iljaam main
 Later, behind the father, son Narayan Sai was also taken to jail in a similar charge
 khabar ye he ki in donon ke jail jane ke baad se ab tak kul chah logon par jaanaleva hamalaa ho chukaa he jo kisi naa kisi tarah se in baap-bete ke cese se jude hai
 Two of them were murdered
 or doosraa katl isi ravivaar ko hua he
 Amritbhai Gulabchand Prajapati, Raju Chandhok, one of the afflicted sisters of Surat (former followers of Narayan Sai) and Akhil Gupta are three strange things with all their characters
 pehla to ye ki ye sabhi ke sabhi rape or paakhand ke iljaamon se ghire tathakthith sant asaram baapu yaa phir unke bete narayan sai ke kareebi rah chuke hai
 Secondly, with the changing times, all of them have dared to speak the truth against Asaram and his son Narayan Sai and thirdly that two of these four have been killed by anonymous murderers and the other two have been killed on their own
 The attack narrowly survived
 mujffarnagar ke rahane vaala akhil gupta kabhi asaram or khaas kar unke bete narayan sai kaa behad kareebi hua karata tha
 He not only used to work as a cook for the father and son but also took care of all his needs
 isi silsile main wo kareeb das saalon tak unke ahmedabad ashram main bhi rahaa lekin baad main vahiin ek ladki se shaadi karne ke baad wo waapas apane ghar mujffarnagar laut aayaa
 After this, he was doing the business of dairy living here, but on Sunday night at around quarter past eight, he was returning to his house on a scooter
 achaanak bike par aae kuch hamalaavaron ne use peeche se goli maari or andhere kaa phayda uthaa kar faraar ho gaye
 Akhil was later taken to the hospital, but by then he had died
 darasal, akhil surat kii do bahanon kii shikaayat ke baad asaram or narayan sai ke saath rape ke maamle kaa mulgim ban chukaa tha kyonki un dinon akhil ne bhi kathith taur par baap-bete kii karatuut main unka saath diya tha
 Akhil, who was Asaram's cook in Muzaffarnagar, was targeted by two men who came on the bike and shot him in the dark
 
 
 thik usee tarah jis tarah pichley saal asaram ke vaidya rahe amritbhai prajapati ko do logon ne rajkot kii clinics main aakar goliyon kaa nishaanaa banaaya tha
 
 
 So, is this just the same way of killing the two witnesses who open their mouths against Asaram? Or is the gesture something different? Asaram's former physician, sevadar and Razdarji Yes, it was the person who threw the mask of Sharafat for the first time from the face of Asaram, who had become a living God from the aura of religion
 garaj ye ki prajapati ne hi pehali baar duniya ko ye bataaya ki kis tarah se asaram baapu dharm ke naam par paakhand kii dukaan chalaa rahaa tha or kis tarah wo dusron ko to brahmacharya kaa paath padhaa rahaa tha, lekin khud apane ashram main ek nahin anginat ladakiyon or mahilaon ke saath rishte bana rahaa tha
 Due to the hypocrisy, it was not an easy thing to open a front against a person who had the mind of millions of people
 lihaaza, jaise hi prajapati ne apana munh kholaa, unhen daraane-dhamkaane kii koshishon kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya lekin prajapati naa to rukanevaale the or naa ruke balki unhone asaram ke wo raaj fash kar die jiske bare main koi soch bhi nahin saktaa tha
 After becoming aware of the same reality of Asaram, Prajapati left him and had become a witness in many cases registered against him
 lekin badakismati se ek rose vahi ho gaya jiskaa dar tha
 Prajapati was shot dead by two criminals who had come to his clinic in Rajkot and died after suffering a full 19 days of death in the hospital
 solah saal kii ek maasoom ke saath yon shoshan ke iljaam main ghirne ke baad asaram ke sitare kuch aise gardish main gaye ki phir kabhi raushan nahin hue
 It is one day and one day today, Asaram has made every effort to come out of jail
 har daleel de chuke hai, har fariyaad suna chuke hai lekin adaalat or kanoon ke liye sabake sab bemaani or thothe sabit hue
 Recently, Asaram tried to breathe open air by weaponizing his illness
 magar, afsos ye koshish bhi bekaar chali gai

 vahiin, gujarat ne qualifire-1 main bengal ko hi haraakar final main pravesh kiya
 pro-kabaddi has brought this Navy sergeant closer to becoming a millionaire
 Both teams are strong
 patna or gujarat, donon ke paas behtareen redar hai
 Gujarat however emerged as a strong team in the league
 uski rading captain sukesh hegade, mahendra rajput or sachin tanvar jaise khilaadiyon ke dam par shandaar rahi he, lekin abozar, fajel atracheli or parvesh banswaal ke kaaran uske majboot dephence ko tod paanaa anya 11 tiimon ke liye is sijan main asambhav rahaa he
 All three have proved the defense of Gujarat this season's strong defense
 pro-kabddi ke sijan-5 (2017) ke sabase mahange khiladilig main gujarat or patna kii bhidnt do baar hui he
 Both times Sukesh's team has beaten Patna
 interjonal wyk chalange main 29 sitambar ko gujarat ne patna ko 30-29 se haraaya tha, vahiin aath oktober ko interjonal wild card wyk main sukesh kii team ne 33-29 se pradeep kii team par jeet hasil kii thi
 Gujarat coach Manpreet Singh is also fully prepared for the final match
 unhone ek baar kaha tha ki vah lig main patna ke khilaaf kisi bhi match main pradeep ko super-10 nahin maarane denge or aise hua bhi
 Talking about Patna, he has two excellent raiders in the form of 'dip King' Pradeep and Monu Goyat, but his defense is weak, which can benefit Gujarat
 captain pradeep ne khud bhi team ke kamjor dephence kii baat ko sweekaara he
 He said, 'I and Monu Goet will mainly handle the responsibility of raiding in my team, but we have to improve our weak defense
 ' Actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha remained completely silent in the 16th Lok Sabha, saying 'khamosh'
 unhone pichley paanch saal main loksabhaa main ek bhi sawaal nahin poocha or na hi kisi charchaa main hissaa liya
 Not only this, he did not put any private member bill on the floor of the House during this period
 haalanki saansad nidhi se kharch karne ke maamle main unhone gajab kaa record banaaya
 In the last 5 years, Shatrughan Sinha is ahead of the rest of the mps in terms of spending of MP funds
 shatrughna sinha bihar ke patna sahib se saansad hai
 He won the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 for the second time from Patna Sahib on a BJP ticket
 ab wo bhartiya janata party chhodkar congress party jwine karne kii yojana main hai
 Shatrughan Sinha may not have asked a single question in the Lok Sabha from 2014 to 2019, but kept questioning his old party BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi outside the House
 loksabhaa main sawaal poochkar saansad apane sansadeey kshetra main hone vaale vikaas kaaryon kaa jayja lete hai
 At the same time, questions are raised about which of the many schemes being run by the government in his area, which scheme benefited in his parliamentary constituency and which did not benefit
 iske jariye saansad sarkaar kii javabdehi bhi batalaate hai
 a question is asked by any MP or what is said during the discussion is recorded in the proceedings of the Lok Sabha
 sawaal poochne or charchaa main shaamil hone se is baat kaa pataa chalata he ki sthaneey saansad apane ilaake ke bare main kitna phikrmand he
 Apart from this, mps can introduce 60 private member bills
 vahiin, 16veen loksabhaa main ensipi kii supriya sule ne ek hajaar 181 sawaal, samaajawaadee party ke dharmendra yadav ne ek hajaar 25 sawaal or congress ke rajeev saatav ne ek hajaar 115 sawaal puche
 Shatrughan Sinha is not a new MP in the Lok Sabha; Shatrughan Sinha has not become a first-time MP for the past five years, who has made a record of not asking a single question in the Lok Sabha
 wo sadan main nae navele saansad nahin hai, balki duusari baar loksabhaa saansad chune gaye hai
 Prior to this, he has been a Rajya Sabha MP twice from 1996 to 2008
 itnaa hi nahin, wo atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar main kendriya swasthya or parivaar kalyaan mantri ke alaava kendriya shipping mantri rah chuke hai
 bjp's Shatrughan Sinha ticket Katasatrughna Sinha has been seen attacking the leadership of the party including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah on several occasions
 bijepi netritv par hamale ko lekar wo surkhiyon main bhi khub rahe
 The party has also cut his ticket in the Lok Sabha elections this time due to publicly attacking the BJP leadership
 is baar bhartiya janata party ne shatrughna sinha kii patna sahib seat se kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ko chunaav maidan main utaara he
 Every news of the election will be received directly in your inbox
 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator The central government has taken a major step to settle criminal cases running on mps and mlas
 centre sarkaar ne in maamalon ko nipataane ke liye ek saal tak 12 special court chalaane par sahmati jataai he
 About 1571 criminal cases will be heard in these special courts
 ye cese 2014 tak sabhi netaaon ke dwaara daayar halafname ke aadhaar par hai
 These cases should be disposed of within a year as per the order of the Supreme Court
 kanoon mantri kii ore se daakhil halafname main is baat kii pushti hui he
 Let us tell you that earlier during the hearing in the Supreme Court, the Election Commission had demanded a lifetime ban on tainted leaders
 jabaki centre sarkaar ne ise khaarij karte hue 6 saal kii bain ko hi lagu rakhane ko kaha tha
 Just before voting in Gujarat and Himachal elections, the Supreme Court gave a shock to the tainted leaders and asked to present a plan to set up a special fast track court to complete the hearing of the cases against them
 court kaa aadesh tha ki chah hafte main sarkaar apana draft plan court ko saunpe, jisamen fast trek court kii sankhya or samay kii jaankaree bhi rahe, taaki kisi bhi daagi janpratinidhi ke khilaaf daakhil mukademe kaa nipataara saal bhar ke bheetar ho jaae
 Let me tell you that recently the ADR published this report after studying the affidavits of 4852 mlas and mps
 jisamen daagi netaaon ko lekar kai khulaase hue the
 These were the highlights of the report - out of the 51 public representatives who have admitted crime against women in their affidavits, 3 are mps and 48 mlas
 -334 aise ummidavaar the jinke khilaaf mahilaon ke prati aparaadh ke mukademe darj hai, lekin unhen manyata praapt raajnneetik partiyon ne tikat diya tha
 The affidavit study revealed that Maharashtra has the highest number of mps and mlas with criminal image, where there were 12 such people
 duusare or tisare number par pashchim bengal or odisha hai
 Union Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani has said to promote Sanskrit and make it the language of common people in schools as well as the need to do more research in this subject
 kendriya mantri ne yah bhi kaha ki sanskrit yoga kii bhashaa he or is kshetra ke vidhyaarthiyon ko puri duniya main yoga ko lekar badhati dilchaspee kaa laabh uthaanaa chahie
 He said, all Sanskrit schools should have yoga teachers
 rashtriya sanskrit santaande paanchave dikshant samaaroh main irani ne kaha, yadi ham sanskrit ko janamanas kii bhashaa bananaa chaahate hai to aasaan sanskrit ko badhaava dena chahie
 He said that Sanskrit education should be changed according to modern needs and modern technology should be used to promote it
 smriti ne kaha ki paathyakramon main bhi sudhaar kiya janaa chahie
 Talking about his vision for Sanskrit in the next ten years, the Union Minister said, each state should produce at least two-three scholars in this field
 input:bhashaa After the passing of the Citizenship Amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha, this bill has also been introduced in the Rajya Sabha
 loksabhaa (lok Sabha) sadan main bill ke paksh main 311, jabaki virodh main 80 vot pade
 Reactions of this people started coming in the Lok Sabha only after the bill was passed
 yahaan tak ki kai bollywood kalakaaron ne bhi naagarikta sanshodhan bill kaa virodh kiya
 Recently, on this bill, Bollywood actor Adil Hussain has tweeted, which has made a lot of headlines on sight
 is bill ko lekar adil hossain (adil Hussain) ne bataaya ki naagarikta sanshodhan bill or enarasi ke vajah se vah kaaphi chintit hai
 In All THESE chaos of NRC and CAB, # citizenshipamendmentbill i am most concerned and deeply saddened that the fundamental "identity" of ours as human is massacred
 In this fight no body will win
 Everybody will loose
 The greatest loss of our times will be humanity itself
 In his tweet, Adil Hussain said about NRC and Citizenship Amendment Bill, "I am most saddened and worried between the chaos of NRC and Citizenship Amendment bill because as a human being Our original identity is being eroded
 is ladaai main koi nahin jitegaa
 Everyone will lose hamaare sayam kii sabase badi haani maanavtaa kii hogi
 "apart from this, Adil Hussain made another tweet, in which he said if our primary identity is lost then what will we do using Muslim, Hindu, Assamese and Bengali
 When we were born, our families had cheered because our mothers had given birth to a Human & not a squirrel! We were born a human FIRST
 If we cannot retain, protect & celebrate the PRIMARY identity than what's the USE of calling ourselves a Muslim, Hindu, Assamese or a Bengali? Adil Hussain said, "when we were born, our family was happy Because our mother gave birth to a human, not a squirrel
 ham pehle ek insaan ke taur par janme hai
 If we cannot hold it as our primary identity, save it and refuse it, then what is the use of calling ourselves Muslim, Hindu, Assamese and Bengali? "talking about the Citizenship Amendment Bill, then Home Minister Amit Shah (shah) said on this that this bill will work to give citizenship to refugees
 unhone kaha ki yah bill kisi bhi tarah se gaiyr sanvaidhanik nahin he na hi ye artical-14 kaa ulanghan karata he
 Withdrawal of bjp's support in Jammu and Kashmir has imposed Governor's rule
 rajya main amarnath yatra chal rahi he
 In the midst of all this, the dream of forming a new manipulative government in the princely state has intensified once again
 pidipi ke chaar vidhayakon ne party ke khilaaf bayaan diya he
 PDP MLA Abdul Majeed Paddar says he is not happy with the party and other mlas should also try to form government
 unase pehle imran ansaar, aabid ansaari, abbaas ahamed bhi party se naaraazgi kii baat kar chuke hai
 Actually, behind this fragrance is a tweet made on 27 June by Ram Madhav, in-charge of the state
 is twit ke jariye post kii gai tasviir main ram madhav srinagar main pichhali sarkaar main mantri rahe sajaad lone ke saath rajya ke rodmap par charchaa karte dikh rahe hai
 Amarnath Yatra is currently going on in the BJP state, which is churning out every possibility of forming a government
 is baar bhi yatra par aatanki saaya mandara rahaa he
 Nobody wants any kind of disturbance in this journey
 aise main mana ja rahaa ki bijepi abhi sarkaar banane ke liye har sambhaavna par manthan kar rahi he or amarnath yatra sampann hone ke baad ise amalijama pehanaane kii koshish karegi
 Ram Madhav's meeting with Sajjad Lone is being seen as this episode
 With J&K former ministers of BJP n PC (sajjad Lone) in Srinagar discussing about the roadmap for the statepic
 twitter
 com / 2bvfvqigol— Ram Madhav (@rammadhavbjp)june 27, 2018‘brallep’ ke baad dhai saal kaa kaarykaal bakiyaheen se rajya main nai sarkaar ke gathan kii charchaaon ko bal miltaa dikh rahaa he
 In fact, after the 'breakup' of PDP-BJP, the government has two and a half years left
 itane lambey vakt tak koi bhi siyaasi dal sarkaar ke gathan kii sambhaavna hone ke baavjood satta se dur rahanaa nahin chahta
 Kahanalon, who was meeting Ram Madhav with Lone, contested the Lok Sabha elections from Baramulla in 2009, but in this he had to face defeat
 iske baad 2014 main handwara se vidhansabha chunaav jeetne vaale lone ko centre ke ishaare par mantri pad diya gaya
 After this, Lone became Modi's admirer
 lone 2014 main prachaar ke dauraan kashmir ko mufti or abdulla parivaar se mukti dilaate hue nai raajnneeti kii pairokari kar rahe the
 Lone wanted new leadership in Kashmir
 yahaan tak ki piem modi bhi prachaar ke dauraan kai baar kashmir janata se baap-bete or baap-beti kii sarkaar kaa ekadhikaar khatm karne kii apil kar chuke hai
 But after the election, when no party got a clear majority, the BJP befriended the PDP and formed the government, which was severely criticized
 bijepi ke liye 19 he ‘magic figar’riyasat main satta kaa maujuuda siyaasi ganit kuch aisa he ki koi bhi dal bina kisi sahyog ke sarkaar nahin bana saktaa
 The PDP is the largest party in the state with 28 mlas
 vahiin bijepi 25 vidhayakon ke saath duusare number par he
 The 'magic figure' that is needed to form a government is 44
 yani agar bijepi sarkaar banane kii koshish karti he to use 19 vidhayakon kii jarurat hogi
 'chances' seen among the angry mlas The National Conference has 15 mlas, but the days of the fall of the Omar Abdullah government have made it clear that they want fresh elections instead of forming a manipulative government in the state
 vahiin 12 vidhayakon vaali congress ne koshish jarur kii, par baat bani nahin
 In such a situation, BJP is looking at the possibility of two mlas of Sajjad Lone's Peoples Party and other independents as well as angry mlas of PDP and National Conference for the need of 19 mlas
 rajya main sipiem kaa ek, peedief kaa ek or teen nirdaleey vidhayak hai
 Three rebel mlas of PDP will ease the way: Three mlas of PDP, Imraj Raza Ansari, Abid Ansari and Mohammad Abbas Wani have openly opposed Mehbooba Mufti
 inke alaava 15 or vidhayak bhi party mukhiya se naaraaz bataae ja rahe hai
 By uniting angry mlas from North Kashmir's Patan, Imran Raza Ansari is making the bjp's path easier
 ansaari ne mahabuuba par parivaarwaad ko badhaava dene kaa aarope lagaate hue hamalaa bolaa tha
 It can become the Tigers In the game of power, the game changerpdp MLA Imran Raza Ansari is considered close to Sajjad Lone and former Finance Minister Haseeb Drabu
 gauratlab he ki haseeb drabu ne bhaajapa-pidipi gathbandhan sarkaar banane main ram madhav ke saath ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Now once again the trio of sajjad-ansari-drabu can prove to be game changers in the game of power

 About 60 thousand crores have been spent in this election

 Notes worth Rs 2 lakh crore are in circulation
 iskaa arth yah hua ki is vakt arthvyavastha main nakadi kii maujugi notebandi na kiye jane kii haalat ke mukaable kareeb 5 lakh karod rupee kam he
 This also shows that the number of cash held by people has also decreased
 chunki is tarah ghar main pade paison kaa arthvyavastha ke vikaas main koi yogadan nahin hota, aise main isaki sankhya main kami desh ke phydemand he
 According to the report, other benefits of demonetisation include increase in tax base, increase in digital transactions, increase in bank deposits and strengthening in housing sector

 According to this report, one of the biggest advantages of demonetisation is that people are attracted towards digital transactions
 vitt varsh 2016-17 main kul 300 karod digital tranjaction darj kii gai
 At the same time, the government estimates that if the trend of the initial weeks of the financial year 2017-18 continues further, this year the number of digital transactions could go up to 2,500 crore

 misbah ne kaha ki bhartiya cricket main badlaav ke liye dhoni kaa bada yogadan he
 Although Dravid and Ganguly also did well, what Dhoni got from the team is a big thing

 iske alaava bharat kii gendbaaji kaaphi majboot he
 Harbhajan said that before the India and Pakistan matches in the 2019 World Cup, the pressure will be more on India, because in the mind of a wrestler who is strong, it is said that there should be no defeat
 duusari baat yah he ki team india par dabaav isliye bhi hoga kyonki phir desh main pratikriyaayein tarah-tarah kii hoti hai
 Pakistan has nothing to lose, if it wins then it will be a bonus, but if India loses then it will be a very bad thing for India

 If we even wish him a happy birthday, then we start abusing in the country
 pakistan main bhi kuch aise hi log honge
 But this does not mean that the whole of Pakistan and the whole of India is bad
 kuch bhi baat hoti he to baat aati he ki cricket band kar do, trade jari rahane do, lekin cricket band kar do
 All things should be weighed in the same scales

 He was constantly encouraging his team of lawyers and was constantly whispering in the ear of senior advocate Ramesh Gupta

 He politely told India Today that he was only 'helping' his team of lawyers
 unhone kaha, ''ve acha kaam kar rahe hai
 Raja "spent 15 months in Tihar Jail on corruption charges in the 2G spectrum allocation scam

 Keep in mind, Srivastava had given a statement that Raja, being the then Telecom Minister, was the 'last authorized person' to decide on the policy issues of the Department of Telecommunications

 Many times the king said something slowly to Ramesh Gupta's ear, after which Gupta would say something to the ear of senior advocate Sushil Kumar, who was sitting by himself to call for an answer
 raja or unke vakeelon kii team ne yah sabit karne kii koshish kii ki shrivastav sibiai ke dabaav main galat bayaan de rahe hai
 Srivastava had earlier stated that the personal secretary of the king at that time, R

 Chandolia had asked him not to take any more new applications after Unitech's application for 2G licenses
 susheel kumaar ne shrivastav se kaha, ''1 agast, 2012 ko is adaalat ko die bayaan main aapane kaha tha ki 'chandoliya ne mujhase poocha tha ki unitech kaa aavedan aa gaya yaa nahin?’ haalanki 4 march, 2011 tak sibiai ko aapane jo bayaan die, unamem to yah baat nahin aati
 The lawyer asked him why he had not told CBI earlier that Chandolia had asked him to get Unitech's application to the department
 shrivastav ne is baat se inkaar kiya ki unhone jhootha bayaan diya he
 At the end of the day, there was satisfaction in Raja's team that he managed to discount Srivastava's credibility
 raja ne kaha, ''main kaarywahi se santusht hum

 pradhanmantri manmohan singh par 2ji spectrum aavanton se judi har baat main shaamil hone kaa aarope lagaate hue bhaajapa ne kaha ki doshi vyakti apni sharte nahin thope saktaa he
 He said that Singh and Home Minister p Chidambaram would have to answer every question related to the scam
 2ji maamle main spashtikaran den piem, sonia: annadramukamukhya vipakshi dal ne daawa kiya ki tu ji spectrum aavanton main pehle aao, pehle paao se lekar videshi companiyon se gathjod tak pradhanmantri ko sabhi choti se choti baton kii jaankaree thi lekin vah ab isse pallaa jhaadne kii koshish kar rahe hai

 isse spasht hua he ki pradhanmantri spectrum aavanton kii chote se chote maamle ke prabandhan main jude the

 The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is aligned to 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar
 nishchit rup se is baat main andeh nahin ki isamen sabase zyaada faaydaa main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii janata dal united or ramvilas paswan kii lok janashakti party ko rahaa he
 To keep these two together, the BJP offered sacrifices to both seats and mps to follow the coalition religion
 sabase zyaada faayde main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar dikhte hai jinaki party jediu loksabhaa chunaav main maatr do siten jiti thim lekin is baar baad satraa siton par chunaav ladegi
 Until two and a half months before today nobody expected that BJP would agree to give 17 seats to Nitish Kumar on an equal formula
 lekin aap ise nitish kii raajnneetik haisiyat kahen yaa vartmaan paristhiti main bhaajapa ko us jamini haqiqat kaa ahsaas
 The BJP not only accepted this desire of Nitish, but first showed Jitan Ram Manjhi and later Upendra Kushwaha out of the NDA
 kushvaha ko lekar bijepi main do raay thi
 But keeping the Nitish Kumar happy in the 2019 elections was a big priority for the BJP
 nitish ne barabari-barabari kaa samjhauta bhi bijepi adhyaksh amit shah se do maheene pehle hi kara liya tha kyonki unhen maaloom tha ki teen rajyon ke vidhansabha ke chunaav kaa parinaam anukool aane par bijepi kaa rukh or bhi badal saktaa he
 But these election results also benefited the Lok Janshakti Party President Ram Vilas Paswan
 seat samjhaute bijepi ke golmol ravaiye par ramvilas paswan ke bete chiraag paswan ne saarvajanik twit or bayaanbaji shuru kar di
 In a statement, he also questioned Demonetisation directly to PM Modi
 bijepi nishchit rup se dabaav main aa gai kyonki unhen is baat kaa andaaz tha ki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar bhi chaahate hai ki rajyasabha kaa aashwaasan puraa kiya jaae
 The BJP was also afraid that if Paswan was upset then the door of the grand alliance is open for him, which could prove very damaging for the BJP
 vahiin bijepi netaaon kaa kahana he 1996 ke baad pehali baar bihar kii raajnneeti main bijepi or jediu baraabar-baraabar siton par chunaav ladegi
 Except 2014, Janata Dal United and earlier Samata Party have always contested many more seats than BJP
 bihar main apane sahyogiyon ke liye bijepi ne jaisaa 'balidaan' diya he uskaa ek sandesh gaya he ki ham apane sahyogiyon ko kitna tavajjo dete hai
 As far as giving Rajya Sabha seat to Paswan is concerned, it will definitely have a positive effect on Dalit voters
 lagata he ki dilli main congress kii haar ke baad rahul gandhi ne aam aadmi party se seekhney kii jo baat kahi thi, uskaa asar bihar main dikhnaa shuru ho gaya he
 It is difficult to say how much the Congress are learning at the level of ideas, but the Congressmen have taken a sweep in their hands
 dilli main 'jhaadu' ne 'haath' ko saaf kiya, to bihar main 'haath' ne 'jhaadu' ko tham liya
 Outpost vote, after the Delhi elections, the Congressmen of Bihar have literally taken a sweep in their hands
 isse pehle ki aam aadmi party jhaadu lekar sadakon par utarati, congressi pehle hi jhaadu thamkar utar aae hai
 Bihar Pradesh Congress President is doing a unique experiment in the state
 har hafte ravivaar ko congressiyon kii toli sadakon par utar rahi he or sadakon ko saaf karne kaa bidaa uthaa rahi he
 This is the new campaign of Bihar Congress
 yah dekhne main anoothaa he, kyonki saalon se kisi ne congress ko sadakon par nahin dekha
 Although this campaign of Congressmen seems more 'photo op' in the state and the campaign is less, it has definitely given the opportunity to the Congress in the headlines in Bihar
 pradesh congress ke mutabik, jhaadu se sadak saaf karke ve log asal raajnneeti par utar aae hai

 It was Virat's 17th century chasing the target
 unhone ranon kaa peechha karte hue 17 shatak lagane ke sachin ke record kii barabari kar lee
 While Sachin played 232 innings for so many centuries, Virat achieved this feat in just 96 innings
 lekin viraat ne saaf kar diya he ki sachin ke aankadon tak pahunchnaa bahut mushkil hoga
 Being close to more friends leads to disorientation, he said in an interview given for bcci
com - i am lucky that i am not close to many people
 main sochataa ki yah aapke liye yah madadgaar he
 If you have more number of friends or people talking, then there is disorientation and time management becomes impossible
 apni aakankshaon ko simit nahin karnaa chahiekohli ne kaha- main itnaa lanbaa yani 24 varsh tak na khel paaun
 Certainly 200 Tests, 100 international centuries, these are excellent figures
 in tak pahunch paanaa lagbhag asambhav he
 But it is a matter of course that i always want to make a difference
 kisi ko apni aakankshaon ko simit nahin karnaa chahie
 i believe that i leave the game with a better achievement
 dilli se sate sibar city gurugram main aparaadh ke taaja aankade behad daraavne hai
 According to these figures, the target of criminals on young children has increased in Gurugram
 2012 se 2017 ke bich 5 varshon main gurugram se 1062 bachche agava kar liye gaye yaa laapata ho gaye
 Of these, the number of minors was 677
 unamem bhi 365 naaballig bacchon kaa ab tak koi suraag nahin mil sakaa he
 According to the figures, only 154 innocent kidnappings were disappeared from Gurugram in 2017 alone
 gaayab masuumon main 115 ladkiyaan shaamil hai
 Gurugram Police has released these figures
 sibar city gurugram main lagaataar gaayab hote maasoom police prashasan ke liye sirdard banate ja rahe hai
 What do these innocent people, who are chirping in the open sky, know about the nefarious plan in the basket of greed
 haal hi main gurugram main kai aise maamle saamne aae hai, jahaan rishton kii door main fansaakar yaa toffee kaa laalach dekar masuumon kii asmat kaa sauda hua
 If we look at the figures of Gurugram Police, then it becomes clear that innocent people are not safe in Gurugram
 2012 se ab tak 1062 bachche gumshudagi yaa kidnaping jaisi vaardaaton kaa shikaar hue hai, jinamein se 677 ladkiyaan raheen
 Out of these, 312 girls were successfully raped by the police, but still no clue of 365 girls has been found in Gurugram Police Childhood Missing Cell
 jabaki naaballig ladakon kii sthiti bhi sibar city main gumshudagi yaa apharan kii zyada sudhari nahin he
 In this also, from the last 5 years ie from 2012 to 2017, 385 minor children were lost or kidnapped
 inamen se 180 ko gurugram police ne sakushal barmaad kar liya, lekin inamen bhi takreeban 205 bacchon kaa koi suraag gurugram police nahi laga pai he
 If we look at the statistics, Gurugram police, which has become the most high-tech Haryana, has no clue about 570 children kidnapped or missing in the last 5 years
 2017 main takreeban 115 ladkiyaan or 39 ladke sibar city se agava kar liye gaye yaa gumshuda hue
 Out of these, only 36 girls have been destroyed, ie 79 girls are still missing
 beete saal takreeban 39 ladke gurugram se gumshuda hue, jabaki inamen bhi sirf 15 ladakon ko hi gurugram police barmaad kar pai he, jabaki 24 ladakon kaa koi suraag nahin lag sakaa he
 According to experts, the setting of people associated with the business of human trafficking is in many cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Rajasthan, Haryana and South India
 dilli or mumbai main sabase zyada chote bacchon ko bechaa jaataa he
 Children are sold as domestic servants there
 itnaa hi nahin haryana or rajasthan main sabase zyada ladakiyon kii supplai hoti he
 There are many towns and villages where girls are sold to marry
 das saal se kam umr ke bacchon ke gaayab hone ke peeche yah bhi mana jaataa he ki bade paimaane parabheekh mangavane vaalegangs kaa haath iske peeche hota he
 More than half a dozen gangs are laying their nets in Gurugram
 yahaan sakriy gang bacchon ko chori karne ke baad duusare shaharon main sakriy gang ko transfar kar dete hai
 Similarly, children stolen from other cities are brought to Gurugram and sold to an active gang begging
 yogi sarkaar akhilesh yadav ke kai dream project par hathodaa chalaane ja rahi he
 The Yogi government has put a stop to former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's biggest scheme 'samajwadi Pension Yojana' with immediate effect and has issued orders to check its eligibility
 somvaar der raat mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne yah faisla liya
 For the past few days, the Yogi government has been selectively shutting down the schemes launched during the rule of Akhilesh Yadav and Samajwadi Party or ordering an inquiry into them

 The issue of Yogi's zeal on the Samajwadi Pension Scheme is a matter of the Samajwadi Pension Scheme
 This pension scheme was not only included in the dream project of Akhilesh Yadav but also made it his biggest electoral issue by Akhilesh Yadav
 Before the election, Akhilesh Yadav turned around socialist Talking about doubling the pension scheme, but now the Yogi government is going to stop this scheme for the present
 akhilesh sarkaar samaajawaadee pension ke tahat mahilaon ko 500 har maah detii thi jise chunaav ke dauraan unhone 1000 rupee karne kaa vaada kiya tha lekin yogi sarkaar ise roak kar kuch nayaa karne kii taiyaari main he
 a hammer can run on a bicycle track
 The same situation is also with Akhilesh Yadav's Dream Project Cycle Track
 sarkaar ne sadakon ke chaudeekaran ke naam par in cycle treks ko todane par charchaa kar lee he lekin aakhri taur par is par faisla nahin hua he lekin jald hi cycle trek par hathaudaa chalane kaa aadesh bhi jari ho saktaa he
 Akhilesh's picture has been told that before this, many names like socialist ambulances, ration cards with Akhilesh's picture, Samajwadi salt, have changed
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki yogi sarkaar is puri pension yojana ko band karti he yaa phir nae kalevar main nae naam ke saath pesh karti he

 com / 4gedumv4oi The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday strongly attacked Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and said that he wants to run the state in the same way as the Samajwadi Party (SP)
 bijepi ne mukhyamantri se anurodh karte hue kaha he ki unhen bade man se apni bhul sweekaar kerani chahie
 BJP state unit spokesperson Vijay Bahadur Pathak said, "akhilesh is intent on running the state like his own party
 unhen jo thik lagegaa vah rahegaa jo nahi lagegaa vah nahin rahegaa
 He is trying to run the state as per his convenience
 " Pathak said that SP leaders sometimes give vent to their anger by giving a statement of running the government without IAS, sometimes they advise the leaders not to come up
 unhone kaha, "nilambit iees adhikari durga shakti nagpal ke maamle main bade man se sarkaar ko apni bhul sweekaar kar leni chahie
 Why is the government, which rolls back on many issues, is not accepting its mistake in this matter
 aakhir kiske dabaav main sarkaar apni bhul ko sweekaar karne se batch rahi he
 " unhone kaha ki sapa ke varisht netaa ramgopal yadav ne pichley dinon yah sweekaar kiya tha ki durga shakti nagpal ke khilaaf kuch zyada hi kadi karrwai kar di gai
 Suddenly taking his U-turn, saying that IAS will run the state without officers is a part of a larger conspiracy to push the state towards anarchy
 tippaniyan Pathak said that even after the report of the Local Notification Unit (LIU), it has been proved that the suspension of Durga Shakti Nagpal is not justified from anywhere
 mukhyamantri jis durga shakti nagpal ko nilambit karne ke peeche yah hawala de rahe hai ki unhen khufia vibhaag kii report ke aadhaar par nilambit kiya gaya, usee report main durga shakti ke khilaaf aisi kisi prakaar kii baat kaa ullekh tak nahin kiya gaya he
 Pathak said that various reports have proved that the government is bent on doing its own arbitrariness in the entire episode and an honest woman IAS officer is suffering its consequences
 bijepi kii pradesh ikai ke pravaktaa vijay bahadur pathak ne kaha, "akhilesh soobe ko bhi apni party kii tarah hi chalaane par amada hai
 What they feel will be good, what they don't feel will not be
 apni suvidha ke anusaar vah soobe ko chalaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 " pathak ne kaha ki sapa ke netaa kabhi bina iees ke sarkaar chalaane kaa bayaan dekar apni khiz utaarte hai to kabhi netaaon ko upra na aane tak kii salaah de daalate hai
 He said, "in the case of suspended IAS officer Durga Shakti Nagpal, the government should accept its mistake with a lot of heart
" kai muddon par role back karne vaali sarkaar is maamle main apni bhul ko kyon nahin sweekaar kar rahi he
 After all, under whose pressure the government is avoiding accepting its mistake
 " He said that senior SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav had recently admitted that very strict action was taken against Durga Shakti Nagpal
 achaanak hi unka you-turn lete hue yah kahana ki bina iees adhikariyon ke hi pradesh chalaa lenge, pradesh ko araajaktaa kii ore dhakelne kii badi sajeesh kaa ek hissaa he
 The comments pathak ne kaha ki sthaneey abhisuchana ikai (elaiu) report ke samaane aane ke baad bhi yah baat sabit ho gai he ki durga shakti nagpal kaa nilamban kahin se bhi jaij nahin he
 The Chief Minister is referring to the suspension of Durga Shakti Nagpal that she was suspended on the basis of the report of the Intelligence Department, the same report does not even mention any such thing against Durga Shakti
 pathak ne kaha ki vibhinn reporton se yah sabit ho gaya he ki sarkaar is puure prakaran main sirf apni manamaani karne par tuli hui he or iskaa dushprinaam ek eemaandaar mahila iees adhikari ko bhugatna pad rahaa he
 Pathak said that SP leaders sometimes give vent to their anger by giving a statement of running the government without IAS, sometimes they advise the leaders not to come up
 unhone kaha, "nilambit iees adhikari durga shakti nagpal ke maamle main bade man se sarkaar ko apni bhul sweekaar kar leni chahie
 Why is the government, which rolls back on many issues, is not accepting its mistake in this matter
 aakhir kiske dabaav main sarkaar apni bhul ko sweekaar karne se batch rahi he

 Now some similar questions will also be asked to Mulayam Singh Yadav

 However, the Congress reversed the bjp's claim that Rahul Gandhi is emerging as a national leader just like his grandmother Indira Gandhi and mother Sonia Gandhi, so he is contesting in two seats, the bridge between North and South India

 On Tuesday, Chennai Super Kings (CSK) performed brilliantly at the Chidambaram Stadium, defeating Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) by 7 wickets in an IPL match
 match ke baad vijeta team ke captain mahendra singh dhoni kii ek dilachasp tasviir saamne ai
 In this picture Captain Cool headed towards the dressing room after defeating KKR in the match
 tabhi unki najar upar khadey ek shaks par padi
 This person was none other than the owner of Kolkata Knight Riders and Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan
 haalanki, yah tasviir yaheen puri nahin hui balki isamen ek cheharaa or tha jisane match ke dauraan bhi kai baar camere ko apni ore aane ke liye majaboor kiya
 Actually, this was the face of Sakshi, the wife of MS Dhoni
 yah tasviir chennai super kings ne apane twitor pej par share kiya he
 In this picture, Bollywood king Shah Rukh was eyeing Dhoni standing upside down and while his wife was also seeing this sight next to Shahrukh
 haalanki, yah kaha nahin ja saktaa ki dhoni kii najar kis par thi, apni patni par yaa phir shahrukh par
 But looking at the picture it can be inferred that Dhoni and Shahrukh were smiling seeing each other
 chennai main khele is match main dhoni ke dhurandharon ne shahrukh khan kii team ko 7 wicket se haraa diya
 Kolkata's team could only manage 108 runs at the loss of 9 wickets in 20 overs and Andre Russell alone contributed an unbeaten 50 runs

 The CBI raided the official residence of jdu's Bahubali MLA Anant Singh in Bihar

 The CBI raid started from Saturday morning
 sibiai kii tinant singhke awaas ke sabhi kagajaat ko khangaalane main jute gai he
 Anant Singh's employee Kundan Kumar said that about 20 members of the CBI team arrived in the morning
 jaankaree ke mutabik, jaanch agency ko ab tak koi aapattijanak kagajaat nahin mili hai
 According to Anant Singh's employee, the CBI team took a laptop with children playing games
 sachivalay thana ke prabharee amrendra kumaar jha ne kaha, 'sibiai kii team anant singh ke awaas par ai he or chhapemari kar rahi he
 Later everything will be revealed
 'kai aaropon se ghire hai anant sinhagauratlab he ki hatya ke liye supaari dene ke aaropee jediu vidhayak anant singh philhal beur jail main band hai
 Mokama's JDU MLA Anant Singh was arrested in June in another kidnapping case, surrounded by allegations of kidnapping four youths in the floods of Patna district and killing one of them
 vidhayak ke ghar main talaashi abhiyaan ke dauraan police ne insaas raifal kii chah goliyaan or khun se sane kuch kapade baraamad kiye the
 The seeds of change were sown by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as soon as he got the key to power
 jab laal kile kii pracheer se jhanda fahraane pahunche to unhone iraadon kii ghoshnaa bhi kar di
 Now the results will be revealed gradually one by one
 vaise zyada intjaar bhi nahin karnaa padaa
 It started with the Planning Commission, which was not in Nehru's name, but his name was definitely attached to it
 uski jagah niti ayog ne le lee he
 Now what will really happen in this new packaging, can only be speculated at the moment
 upree taur par vaise to koi khaas baat najar nahin aati
 One thing is sure that all the Prime Minister's dream projects are under the supervision of NITI Aayog
 digital india se lekar mek in india tak
 It is said that among the three celebrities whom Modi has put in his office, one is also former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru
 pehle ise alag tareeke se samajhane kii koshish hui
 Now an attempt is being made to understand it again
 gandhi ke naam par modi sarkaar ne swatchta abhiyaan shuru kiya to congress man masos kar rah gai
 However, later Congress leaders started making noise
 aarope he ki congress ke pratik purushon ko pradhanmantri modi or bijepi hathiyaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 In the case of naming under Congress rule, government schemes seemed to be the property of the nehru-gandhi family
 ab unki jagah shaayad purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi or bijepi ke pratik purushon ke naam honge
 By giving Bharat Ratna to Vajpayee, the new government also sealed those intentions
 thodaa or chal kar pataa chalaa ki ab nehru ke naam par chal rahi yojanaon ke bhi din lad gaye
 Now the 'JNNURM' program, named after the first Prime Minister of Atal Mission, Nehru, will now be known as Atal Mission for Rejuvenate and Urban Transformation (AMRUT)
 'jeenenyuarem' kaa pehle charan kaa kaarykram pichley saal aakhir main khatm ho gaya tha
 The UPA-2 government had made preparations for the second phase by 'JNNURM', but the scheme was not approved
 nai vyavastha ko isamen zyada mashkkat bhi nahin kerani padi
 In the name of good governance, the government planned to celebrate Atal Bihari Vajpayee's birthday as Good Governance Day
 jab media main khabar ai to bayanon kaa daur chalaa – khub bavaal hua
 With the reshuffle in the programs, we had to be content with the ritual payment
 jin par lataki talwargeenenyuarem kii hi tarah centre sarkaar kii skim he - jawaharlal nehru rojgaar yojana
 It is possible to change its name a few days later [however, no such news has come yet]
 iske alaava aise saikadon puraskaar, scolership or santhaan hai jo nehru ke naam par hai
 Let us now look at those on whom the sword is seen hanging
 ye hai - jawaharlal nehru antarrashtriya shanti puraskaar, jawaharlal nehru memorial medal, nehru bal samiti bahaduree puraskaar, jawaharlal nehru bal kalyaan aword, jawaharlal nehru memorial fund, soviet land nehru aword, jawaharlal nehru aword for international anderstanding, jawaharlal nehru neshnal science campatishan awords, jawaharlal nehru prise for popularigeshan of science aadi
 a look at the Atal and patelmedia reports shows that the Central Government is slowly taking steps to remove the name of the nehru-gandhi family from government schemes
 jis tarah nehru kii jagah atal ke naam par yojana kaa namakaran kiya gaya he, aane vaale dinon main aisi tamaam yojanaayen hongi jinase purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi kaa naam hat jayega or unki jagah sardaar patel kaa naam aa sakegaa
 The BJP once claimed to be the party with difference
 usee bijepi ne ab sarkari kaagajon main nehru-gandhi parivaar ke naam par dhaava bol diya he
 Till yesterday, the things on which the BJP used to make noise, after coming to power, now they are also implementing the same
 netaaon kii niyat chaahe jaisi bhi ho – fitrat shaayad ek hi jaisi hoti he
 Anyway, all things are related to what

 ' aajkal bharat main digital content plateforms kii demand teji se bad rahi he
 The reason is that data has become cheaper since the arrival of Jio, and video content is being rapidly consumed, especially in India
 philhal bhartiya bazaar main amejan prime, ji5, hotstr, eeltibalaji or netflix jaise kai digital content plateforms maujuud hai
 Out of this, the most expensive plan has been 0 Netflix so far
 jahaan ek taraf amejan prime ke salbhar ke plan kii keemat 999 rupee he to vahiin netflix ke ek maheene ke plan kii shuruaati keemat 500 rupee thi
 But now Netflix has launched the world's cheapest 250 rupees plan in India
 saath hi company ne ek hafte ke liye bhi plan launch kiya he, jisaki shuruaati keemat 65 rupee rakhi gai he
 UPDATE Netflix has said in an e-mail statement sent to Tech to date, 'we always work to make Netflix better and accessible
 ham chuninda deshon main alag alag opshans kii testing karenge jahaan members, udhaaharan ke taur par kam keemat par mobile divaais par netflix dekh sakenge or kam samay ke liye sabsakrib kar sakenge
 However, these options will not be seen by every user and we can cancel it after the test phase
 ’netflix ne kaha he, ‘mobile vanali plan sirf testing ke liye he
 This is not a new plan nor is the price cut 'there is a constant discussion in India about the series and content of Netflix
 lekin iske plance desh main kaaphi mahange the
 In such a situation, not many people were able to watch the content of the Netflix platform
 lekin ab netflix ne logon kii kuch samasya dur karte hue ek 250 rupee vaala manthali plan launch kiya he
 But this plan has been introduced for mobile / tablet only
 is plan ko company kii website par maujuud karaayaa gaya he
 Although no official announcement has been made by the company for this, but the plan can be purchased
 hamane testing ke liye is plan ko kharida bhi he
 On the other hand, when talking about weekly plans, their starting price is 65 rupees
 haalanki ise keval mobile par dekha ja sakegaa
 Apart from this, the price of Bikali Basic plan has been kept at Rs 125, Standard 165 and Premium Weekly Plan at Rs 200
 mobile or basic plan main keval 1 hi screen milegi, vahiin standard or premium plan main kramash: 2 or 4 screen ko yugers share kar paaenge
 a few days ago, it was reported that Netflix is testing a cheap plan for developing countries like India
 tab 250 rupee vaale isi plan kii jaankaree di gai thi
 However, the company then said that it has been made available only to a few people for testing
 ye mumkin he ki ise bazaar main naa utaara jaae
 It is believed that the company has launched a cheap plan of Rs 250 to compete with other companies like Amazon Prime
 ab tak company ke paas 500 rupee, 650 rupee or 800 rupee ke manthali plance maujuud the
 Now the name of the Rs 250 mobile plan has also been added
 250 rupee vaale nae manthali plan kii baat karen to isamen yugers keval 1 screen kaa hi majaa le paaenge
 Also, it can be used only on mobile or tablet
 iske alaava isamen HD yaa UHD rijolution kaa bhi majaa graahakon ko nahin milegaa, yani yugers keval SD content hi dekh paaenge
 Compare Netflix's plan with other companies' plans, even after bringing a monthly plan of Rs 250, Netflix's plan is still expensive in the market
 udhaaharan ke taur par baat karen to hotstor kaa manthali plan 199 rupee, amejan prime kaa manthali plan 129 rupee, ZEE5 kaa manthali plan 99 rupee or altbalaji ke teen maheene ke sabsakripshan vaala plan 100 rupee main miltaa he
 It is also worth noting that along with Amazon Prime, there are many more benefits including early shopping, free delivery and Amazon Music

" subah main ek meeting he, mujhe pregentation taiyaar karnaa he
 My Vice President is angry and i am currently working alone in the office
 ' Sunil then asked his son to come home after taking 15 days off

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main congress ko karaari shikast kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 The tsunami of BJP and Narendra Modi was so great that Congress President Rahul Gandhi lost the election from Amethi
 haalanki congress ke liye raahat kii baat yah he ki vah loksabhaa main apni party kaa pratinidhitiv kar paaenge kyonki unhone is baar amethi ke saath kerala se vynad se bhi chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya tha, jahaan se unhen jeet mili he
 Rahul won the election from one seat but Jyotiraditya Scindia, who is said to be part of his core team in the Lok Sabha
 deependra hooda, sushmita dev or mallikarjun khadge jaise netaaon ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa he
 The shortage of these leaders who are the biggest attackers on the Modi government in the Lok Sabha will surely be missed by the Congress party

 isse pehle khadge 2 baar saansad or 9 baar vidhayak rah chuke hai
 After his defeat, the Congress has also faced the crisis of choosing the new leader of the party in the House

 Jyotiraditya Scindia, who sits right next to Jyotiraditya Scindiarahul Gandhi, will not be seen in the Lok Sabha this time

 Scindia, who came from Harvard University, has been targeting the ruling party with his sharp questions inside the House

 Youth leader Hooda was defeated by bjp's Arvind Kumar Sharma
 deependra bhi rahul gandhi kii yuva team kaa hissaa hai or sadan main bhi unke saath hi baithte hai
 In his last tenure, Hooda asked a total of 81 questions within the Lok Sabha, while thrice he brought a private member bill
 haryana ke vibhinn muddon samet modi sarkaar ko gherne vaale masalon par hooda ne kai baar loksabhaa main congress party kaa paksh rakhaa
 Apart from this, KC Venugopal, who holds the post of Organization General Secretary in the Congress, is also a leader who targeted the Modi government inside the House for the whole five years, but this time he decided not to contest elections while assuming responsibility of the organization
 kerala ke alppuzha se saansad rahe venugopal congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke sabase kareebi netaaon main se ek hai or yahi vajah rahi jab ashok gahalot jaise varisht netaa ke baad unhen sanghathan mahasachiv kii jimmedaari di gai he
 In addition to Venugopal, Veerappa Moily, who has a strong hold on economic matters, will surely be missed in the Lok Sabha by the Congress, which used to prominently side the Congress against the policies of the government during the budget discussion

 haalanki ye report pehle se aati rahi he ki fasebuk kryptokarency par kaam kar rahaa he
 But how it will be used was not clear
 bharat main watsap ke 200 million yugers hai or steblaquain bharat main launch karne kii vajah yahi he
 Let us tell you that in 2014, facebook hired David Marcus, President of Peeple, the world's top payment gateway
 philhal david marcus fasebuk massenger ap ke head hai or report ye he ki david hi fasebuk kii kryptokaransi steblakwine ko head kar rahe hai
 Apart from this, the company is also continuously expanding its blockchain department
 fasebuk ne haal hi main ye statement diya tha ki duusari companiyon kii tarah fasebuk bhi blockchen technolji ke power ko explor kar rahi he
 whatsapp is continuously trying to bring payment service in India and for this the company has started testing much earlier
 lekin ise public rol out kaa license nahin mila he
 It will be interesting to see if the company is allowed to launch a payment service in India before bringing blockchain

 com The bottom line is the explosion of information in our time
 soochnaaon kaa tantra itnaa viksit ho gaya he or ho rahaa he ki gati ke kaaran sab kuch asthir, gatiman lag rahaa he
 It is compulsory to stress all this on literature
 uski vastu ke saath-saath uske rup tat bhi tut rahe hai
 There is no dearth of interpreters of the object but those who take serious consideration of the form are rare
 aisi sthiti main pratishthit kathakaar or chintak arun prakaash kii sahitya roopon par moulik vichaar karne vaali is pustak kaa aitihaasik mahatv he
 In the beginning of this book, the terms rupbandha and gener for form have been used for form, separating form-bandha and mode
 rup-bandha shabd-sanyog moulik he
 In Hindi criticism, till now such a distinction was not made between form and genre
 aashaa he ki arun prakaash dwaara prastaavit prayog-antar maanya hoga
 Acharya Ramchandra Shukla established the prolificity of prose
 gadhy hamaare saamaajik vyavhaar kaa lagbhag ek maatr bhashaa-rup ban gaya he
 That is why new inventions and genres are constantly being invented in it
 arun prakaash ne is pustak kii rachana hindi gadhy ke itihaas main nirnaayak or abhootpurv sakriy daur main kii he or is sakriyata se upji samasyaon or vivechan-vishleshan kaa moolyankan kiya he
 The reader who goes through the thought process continues to experience that the facts on which the author has drawn conclusions are reliable, the thinker considers them to be continuous or not stable, or constant
 arun prakaash ne aasaan nahin kathin rasta chunaa he
 The collection of facts has been done on such a wide scale that the history of each roop-bandha (or genre) has also come under wraps and its major names
 yah kaam hindi ke hi nahin, anek bhashaaon ke kshetron tak failaa he
 The reader is fascinated by the numerous disciplines and rare (sometimes shocking) information of social history while reading a book
 in soochnaaon kaa kaaran nihsandeh lekhak kaa bahujna hona he
 Writers are journalists, they are particularly interested in history
 pustak main gadhy kii adhyatan vidhaon kaa nirupan kiya gaya he
 The background of the social, historical context of the emergence of those genres is described
 ye vidhaaen paraspar itani mili-juli or samaan hai ki inaki roopaatmak niztaa akasar opel ho jaati he
 Experienced people know that those working on the genres of literature must identify psychoanalysts as well as mental instincts: "there is no information about memory to be completely recovered
" smriti, hamaari soochna ko pahchanaane kii kshamta ko bhi dhoomil karti he
 You are looking for something, found something similar to it
 
 
 isiilie sansmaran ko andeh se dekha janaa chahie
 He must not make the mistake of assuming beyond doubt
 ''yah pustak ek patrkaar, usase badhkar ek rachanaakaar or usase bhi badhkar samaajawaadee vichaardhaara se las deshpremi bahu-path vyakti dwaara likhi gai he
 It is virtually a book of criticism
 apni lekhan style ke kaaran yah aalochana ke saath vidhaon ke itihaas kii bhi pustak ban gai he
 In between comes the creator of Arun Prakash, who adds to this critically-read history book with creative readability
 dow
 Rammanohar Lohia, Acharya Narendra Dev, Prabhash Joshi, Rajendra Mathur, Rajkishore are probably considered for the first time in the category of Hindi essayists
 gadhy kii pahchaan aisi durlabh aalochana kriti he jo vastunishthata ke saath sarjanaatmakataa se bhooshit he
 True criticism is also created and the prose identity is a meaningful example of this statement
 100 karod kii painting chori hone kaa bahaanaa banaakar apane doston par galat iljaam lagane ke aarope main atuly mafatlal kii patni or soshlite sheethal mafatlal ke khilaaf shuukravaar ko exiaar darj karai gai he
 Mumbai Police's Crime Branch Unit 2 filed the FIR after Sheetal's brother-in-law Ajay Mafatlal and friend Yasmin filed a petition in the High Court
 sheethal ne in donon par painting chori karne kaa jhootha aarope lagaaya tha
 In fact, Sheetal had accused his friends Yasmin, Arif Patel and Farooq Wadia of stealing the Naasali paintings and replacing them with fake paintings
 yasmine ke anusaar jab sheethal kii uske pati atuly se alag hone kii baat chal rahi thi, to sheethal ke dost in painting ko sambhalakar rakhane ko raji ho gaye the
 But later the truth came out that the paintings were owned by Paramfatlal Company
 sheetalpar apane doston ke khilaaf jhuthe aarope lagane ke liye ab cese chalegaa
 These alleged friends of Sheetal have enough evidence to prove that Kisital had cheated himself and planned to implicate innocent people for stealing this falsehood
 aarif patel kaa bhi maananaa he ki police ne sheethal ke khilaaf jo cese banaaya he wo shishe kii tarah saaf he
 Illegal construction on the banks of the Yamuna river without any restraint under the nose of the government, a few kilometers from the Parliament in which the central government of the capital Delhi is talking about enacting a law to save the existence of rivers
 Happening
 yamuna nadi kaa kaaphi hissaa avaidh nirmaan apni chapet main le chukaa he
 Explain that the Supreme Court formed a Monitoring Committee in 2006 to stop illegal construction in Delhi, but even then, illegal construction in Delhi is not taking its name
 okhla ke yumna-khadar ilaake main dhadlle se chal rahe avaidh nirmaan kaa alam ye he ki logon ne yumna nadi ko malbe se bharkar ghar banane shuru kar die hai
 After which, politics has started to take place regarding the monitoring committee
 yamuna khadar ilaake main ho rahe avaidh nirmaan ko lekar monitering cameti ke adhyaksh bhurelaal ne kaha ki south emsidi se isaki kai baar shikaayat ho chuki he, lekin koi karrwai nahin hui
 The Chairman of the Monitoring Committee said that the MCD, Delhi Government and DDA are responsible for the illegal construction in the capital Delhi
 unhone kaha ki dilli nagar nigam (emsidi) ne monitering cameti kii shikaayat par gaur nahin kiya
 BJP is in power with MCD, when talking to Manoj Tiwari, he questioned the Monitoring Committee itself and said, Monitoring Committee should be dissolved
 bataa den ki dilli main pichley kai varshon se ceiling or avaidh nirmaan kaa jinn logon ke saath netao ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab banataa ja rahaa he
 In the eyes of the leaders, the Monitoring Committee has always been a problem
 dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari kai baar kah chuke hai ki wo dilli kii satta main aate hi monitering cameti ko bhang kar denge

 bhaajapa kii jab 2014 main bahumat se sarkaar bani to pradhanmantri pad kii shapath lene se pehle hi narendra modi apni team ke liye 'navratnon' kii talash me jute gaye the
 According to sources, for the post of his principal secretary, he needed a capable officer who not only has long experience of working in the center, but also does not have any stain on the Daman
 saath hi afasar ko sabase zyada loksabhaa siten dene vaale uttar pradesh kii bhi nas-nas kii samaj ho
 Modi also wanted to make the IAS officer, who belongs to UP, as principal secretary so that he would be able to do something big for his parliamentary constituency Varanasi too

 Modi's search ended by visiting Nripendra Mishra, a retired 1967 batch IAS officer

 pichley kaarykaal main apane kaam se piem modi kaa bharosa jeetne main safal rahe nripendra mishra ab dobaaraa pramukh sachiv, pradhanmantri bane hai

 tri act bhi nahin ban paaya raah main rodaritair hone ke baad nripendra mishra 2006 se 2009 ke bich tri ke chairman pad par rahe the
 According to the rule, the chairman of TRAI could no longer hold any position in the central or state government
 yah niyam jab nripendra mishra kii raah main roda bana to modi sarkaar ne tri act main adhyadesh ke jariye sanshodhan kar unke pramukh sachiv banane kaa rasta saaf kar diya
 This step is also considered proof of PM Modi's trust in him
 ab modi sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal main bhi unke pramukh sachiv niyukt hone par mana ja rahaa he ki yah piem modi kii apekshaaon par puri tarah khatre utarane or bharosa jeetne kii vajah se hua he
