 In fact, a public interest litigation was filed to stop the pathology lab running indiscriminately

 This PIL was filed on behalf of Bijoun Kumar Mishra
 yachika main court se guhaar lagaai gai ki avaidh rup se dilli ke har gali nukkad main khul chuke pathology lab ko turant band kiya jaae
 The petitioner claims that untrained technicians are kept in such pathology labs, who have no experience of working in the lab
 aprashikshit techneciens ke paas pathology lab chalaane ke liye na to aavashyak degree hoti he or na hi ye register technitian hote hai
 Whereas pathology labs can neither be started nor run without fulfilling these two conditions
 yachikakarta ne apni yachika main kaha he ki dilli sarkaar pathology lab kholane ke liye banaai gai policy par dobaaraa vichaar kare
 As such it can be ensured that untrained technicians will not run the lab
 yachika main jor diya gaya he ki philhal dilli main avaidh dhang se jo pathology lab chal rahe hai vah marijon ke liye jaanaleva hai
 In such a situation, to ensure the safety of patients, the Delhi government needs to make strict standards so that illegal pathology labs can be curbed

 yah to sabhi jaanate hai ki acchhee neend lenaa swasthya ke liye acha hota he, lekin ek naveenatam research main chaunkaane vaala tathy saamne aayaa he ki acchhee neend lene vaale vyaktiyon main kritagyata kaa bhav zyada hota he
 Social psychologists have found in new research that a feeling of gratitude and a tendency towards charity make our psychological well-being better
 yahaan tak ki ham apane paise ko kharidari par kharch karne kaa jo tarika chunate hai uskaa bhi asar swasthya or prasannataa par padataa he
 Amy Gordon of the University of California, Berkeley, co-author of this paper, says that in our society today, less sleep is considered good, while many researches suggest that good sleep is better for physical and mental health
 pehle ke research yah darshaate hai ki kritagyata se acchhee neend aati he, lekin hamaare shodh ise ek duusari disha main pate hai
 The person with less sleep has less tendency towards gratitude and charity
 samaaj main behatar sambandh banane main ye manobhaav bahut sahaayak hote hai
 Expressing gratitude towards others brings the same happiness as giving happiness to others
 nae shodh ke anusaar puri duniya main canada se lekar uganda tak, dakshin africa se lekar bharat tak yah paaya gaya ki khud par kharch karne se kahin zyada khushi dusron par kharch karne se milti he
 Other scientists along with Gordon revealed these interesting aspects of their research at the Society of Personality and Social Psychology of New Orleans
 27 november ko release hone ja rahi film 'tamaasha' ke pramotion ke liye iske sitare ranbir kapur or deepika padukon ne jamkar film kaa prachaar kiya
 Both of them went to many television shows but Ranbir Kapoor did not go to Bigg Boss house
 big bos ke yahaan deepika tamaasha ko pramot karne akele hi gayi
 When we asked Ranbir Kapoor the same question as to why he did not go to promote 'tamasha' in Bigg Boss house, Ranbir said, 'we and the marketing team had made a promotional strategy and we went everywhere but in Bigg Boss i Did not go due to some personal reasons
 'tippaniyan But, what could be these personal reasons? Salman Khan? Because Salman is the host of this show? Although Ranbir took the name of Salman Khan among personal reasons, it may be that due to Salman Khan, Ranbir did not go to Big Boss and Deepika had to go alone because everyone knows that Ranbir Kapoor's special friend Katrina Kaif ever Salman used to be Khan's special friend
 aaj ranbir or katrina ke bich shaadi ko lekar khub baaten ho rahi hai
 Yesterday the same things used to happen about Salman and Katrina
 magar salmaan or katrina alag ho gaye or ranbir katrina saath ho gaye
 It is said that Salman and Ranbir's relationship deteriorated after being with Ranbir and Katrina
 iske baad se donon hi ek duusare ke saamne aane se kataraate rahe hai
 In such a situation, it is obvious that Ranbir must have decided not to go to the Big Boss somewhere
 jab hamane ranbir kapur se yahi sawaal poocha ki aakhir vah kyon nahin gaye big bos ke ghar main 'tamaasha' ko pramot karne to ranbir ne kaha, 'hamane or marketing team ne prachaar ranneeti banaai thi or ham har jagah gaye magar big bos main main kuch nijee kaarnon kii vajah se nahin gaya
 Comments magar, ye nijee kaaran kya ho sakate hai? salmaan khan? kyonki salmaan is sho ke host hai? haalanki ranbir ne nijee kaarnon ke bich salmaan khan kaa naam liya magar ye ho bhi saktaa he ki salmaan khan kii vajah se ranbir nahin gaye big bos main or deepika ko akele hi janaa padaa kyonki sabhi jaanate hai ki ranbir kapur kii khaas dost katrina kaiff kabhi salmaan khan kii khaas dost hua karti thim
 Today, a lot of talk is going on about the marriage between Ranbir and Katrina
 kal yahi baaten salmaan or katrina ke bare main hua karti thim
 But Salman and Katrina split and Ranbir Katrina is together
 bataaya jaataa he ki ranbir or katrina ke saath hone ke baad salmaan or ranbir ke rishte karaab ho gaye
 Since then, both have been shy of facing each other
 aise main zaahir he ki kahin na kahin ranbir ne big bos main na jane kaa nirnay liya hoga

 ‘‘matadaata ko kya matlab ki rajnatik dal chanda se kahaan jutate hai
 They only mean candidates '' - the Supreme Court's reply to the government (april 2019) Parliament should enact a law to keep criminals away from the election - on the advice of the Supreme Court (september 2018), the government swung the ears
 Details of candidates with criminal records should be published in leading newspapers
 '' chunaav ayog ko supreme court ke aadesh (sitambar 2018) par koi karrwai nahinungali par syaahi lagaakar diwane hue jate aam log hi lokshahi kii jimmedaari uthaane ke liye bane hai? chandon kii gandagi, apradhi netaaon or anant chunavi jhooth se unako koi fark nahin padataa jinako chunane ke liye hamen ‘pehle matdaan phir jalpan’ kaa gyaan diya jaataa he! or unka kya jo raajnneeti ko aparaadh mukt karne kii kasam uthaakar satta main aae the!yah 2014 kaa april tha
 The Congress candidate from Varanasi was named in the arms deal
 hardoi kii raily main narendra modi ne vaada kiya ki ‘‘satta main aane ke baad sarkaar ek cameti banaaegi jo chunaav ayog ko mili halafnaamon ke aadhaar par saansadon ke aapraadhik ricard kii jaanch kar supreme court se mukadmaa chalaane ke liye kahegi
 They will be sent to jail
 chaahe inamen bhaajapa yaa endie ke saansad hi kyon na hon
 "narendra Modi won and the promise of freeing politics from crime remained in Hardoi's ground
 alabatta the kuch ziddee log jo siyasat or jaraayam ke gathjod ko khatm karne kii muhim lekar sabase badi adaalat pahunch gaye
 a five-member constitution bench of the Supreme Court told the government last year that the criminal candidates are cancerous, to stop the throttle of democracy with the logic of election-winning candidates
 yah sansad kii jimmedaari he ki vah kanoon banaakar aparaadhiyon ko hameshaa ke liye chunaavon se dur kare
 Even after this order, the Prime Minister did not remember the promise of Hardoi! The Election Commission and the government could not even ensure the implementation of the Supreme Court's order that at least the criminal candidates should be given proper publicity so that people know that Who are they going to make their janitor? ab supreme court ne chunaav ayog ko avmaananaa kaa notice bheja he
 It is worth mentioning that 464 candidates are 'criminals' in the first two phases of this Lok Sabha election
 inamen 46 chaukidaaron (bhaajapa) or 58 nyaayakaron (congress) ke halafnaamon main jaraayam darj he
 About 61 criminal candidates from other major parties (ADR report) are teaching us our democratic responsibility
 galat sochate the ham ki jab bahumat kii sarkaar hogi, taqatvar netaa hoga, desh ke adhikansh hisse main ek dal kaa raaj hoga to hamen aise sudhaar milenge jinaki chaaya main ham apane loktantr par garv kar sakenge
 But now, the Supreme Court, which was quick to act on the slightest thing, could have ordered the details of the donation from the electoral bond to be made public but it pressed the information in the files and put the next date
 • jajon kii niyukti par sarkaar se jujhane vaali sabase badi adaalat apradhi netaaon ke liye kanoon banane par sarkaar ko baadhya kar sakati thi lekin usne upadesh dekar baat khatm kar di
 • If there was not enough publicity of the details of the criminal candidate, what was the harm in ordering the cancellation of the papers? This time the voters' lines are resembling the lines of demonetisation
 matadaata dhoop main tap kar apni loktantric jimmedaari par bichhe ja rahe hai
 But just as the political parties, companies and banks were negotiating the trust of the people through the back door during the ban, the Constitutional institutions want to let everything go wrong after which the trust in this version of democracy will be barely saved
 duniya main kai jagah loktantr he, log vot bhi dete hai lekin vahaan paaltu sansad chuni jaati he, samvidhanon ko umeth diya jaataa he, aazaadiyon ko nunatam rakhaa jaataa he
 The advantages of power are divided in their own way
 ham aisa loktantr haragij nahin chaahate jisamen voter apni jimmedaari nibhaaen lekin vot lene vaale puri besharmi ke saath kuch bhi karte chale jaaen !matadaata or raily main juty kiraaye kii bheed main fark banaae rakhana hoga
 Voting is not always accepted, it can also be made a question or a denial
 vot dena hamaari majbootee he, majaburi nahin

 Now it is up to the central leadership of the BJP to allow Varun to develop or use him to provoke emotions

 The nia's opposition to the supplementary charge sheet in the Malegaon bomb blast did not stop
 buudhvaar ko dhamaake ke ek peedit nisaar ahamed bilal ne to dakhal yachika daayar kar enie kii supplementry chargeshit ko hi kaarij karne kii maang kii he
 Apart from this, the ATS has been requested to listen before taking any decision in the case
 maamle kii sunwaayee ab 10 june ko hogi
 On September 29, 2008, 6 people were killed and 101 were injured in the bomb blast in Malegaon
 tab maharashtra aties ne dhamaake ke liye istemaal motorcycle ke jariye sadhvi pragna thakur ko giraftaar kiya
 Then people like Colonel Purohit and retiring Major Ramesh Upadhyay were arrested
 aties ne maamle main kai gavaahon ke bayaan darj kar daawa kiya ki sadhvi bhi dhamaake kii sajeesh main shaamil thi
 In 2011, the investigation was handed over to the NIA
 5 saal baad 13 may 2016 ko enie ne supplementry chargeshit file kar daawa kiya he ki dhamaake main istemaal motorcycle bhale sadhvi ke naam par thi lekin 2 saal pehle se uskaa istemaal or rakrakhaav raamji kalsangra kar rahaa tha or sajeesh main shaamil hone kaa daawa karne vaale gavaah magistrate ke saamne apane tazaa bayaan main mukar chuke hai
 Therefore, there is not enough evidence to prosecute Sadhvi Pragya Thakur
 yani ek tarah se enie ne sadhvi ko clin chit de di he
 Along with Sadhvi, the NIA has given a clean chit to five more accused
 enie ne maamle par macoka lagane ke liye aties par farjivada karne kaa aarope bhi lagaaya he
 Prior to this, Sadhvi, who failed to get bail 4 times, applied for bail on the basis of clean chit
 lekin uske virodh main to dakhal argiyaan daakhil hui hi, enie kii supplementry chargeshit ke khilaaf bhi dakhal yachika daayar hui hai
 The legal team of jamiat-e-ulema, which had given legal aid to Muslim accused in the Malegaon 2006 bomb blasts, filed two applications in the court on Wednesday demanding dismissal of the NIA supplementary charge sheet
 arji main kaha gaya he ki centre main sarkaar badalane ke baad enie kaa ravaiya badal gaya he
 How is the NIA opposing the bail application of Sadhvi till 2014 suddenly giving her a clean chit? yachika main saaf likhaa gaya he ki enie centre kii bijepi sarkaar ke ishaare par kaam kar rahi he
 The application alleges that the charge sheet filed by the NIA appears to have been done at the will of its political masters to save the accused and get them out of jail
 tippaniyan The petition also mentions the allegation of former NIA lawyer Rohini Salian in which she said that the NIA is asking her to take a soft stand towards the accused
 khaas baat yah he ki arji main enie kii supplementry chargeshit ko kaarij kar aties kii chargeshit ke aadhaar par hi mukadmaa chalaane kaa aagrah kiya gaya he
 Whereas the same ATS Malegaon has become infamous for trapping fake youths in the 2006 bomb blasts
 29 sitambar 2008 ko maalegaanv main hue bam dhamaake main 6 logon kii maut hui thi or 101 log jakhmi hue the
 The Maharashtra ATS then arrested Sadhvi Pragya Thakur through a motorcycle used for the blast
 uske baad karnal purohit or ritair major ramesh upaadhyaay jaise logon kii giraftaar hui
 The ATS recorded the statements of several witnesses in the case, claiming that Sadhvi was also involved in the conspiracy to explode
 saal 2011 main jaanch enie ko saunp di gai
 After 5 years, on 13 May 2016, NIA filed a supplementary charge sheet claiming that the motorcycle used in the blast was in the name of Sadhvi but Ramji Kalsangra had been used and maintained since 2 years ago and claimed to be involved in the conspiracy The witness retracted before the magistrate in his latest statement
 isliye sadhvi pragna thakur ke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane ke liye paryaapt saboot nahin he
 In a way, the NIA has given a clean chit to Sadhvi
 enie ne sadhvi ke saath hi paanch or aropiyon ko bhi clin chit di he
 The NIA has also accused the ATS of fabricating the case for imposing MCOCA
 iske pehle 4 baar jamaanat paane main asafal rahi sadhvi ne clin chit ke aadhaar par jamaanat arji di
 But notwithstanding the intervention applications have been filed against him, an intervening petition has also been filed against the supplementary charge sheet of the NIA

 The application states that the nia's attitude has changed after changing the government at the Center
 saal 2014 tak sadhvi kii jamaanat arji kaa virodh karne vaali enie ab use achaanak se kaise clinit de rahi he? The petition clearly states that the NIA is acting at the behest of the BJP government at the Center
 arji main aarope lagaaya he ki enie dwaara daayar chargeshit se lagata he ki aropiyon ko bachaane ke liye or jail se baahar nikaalane ke liye apane rajnatik aakaaon kii ichha par aisa kiya gaya he
 The comments yachika main enie kii purv vakil rohinee salian ke us aarope kaa bhi ullekh kiya gaya he jisamen unhone kaha tha ki enie unhen aropiyon ke prati naram ravaiya apnaane ke liye kah rahi he
 The special thing is that the application has been requested to dismiss the NIA supplementary charge sheet and prosecute it on the basis of the chargesheet of the ATS
 jabaki yahi aties maalegaanv 2006 bam dhamaakon main farji yuvakon ko fnsaane ke liye badnaam ho chuki he

 rape cese main doshi deraa sachcha sauda pramukh gurmeet ram rahim singh par aise to kai sangeen aarope he
 In this list, they are accused of impotent sages
 aisa hi aarope yon shoshan ke maamle main jail main band asaram baapu par bhi lag chukaa he ki daawaaon ke jariye vah apane sevadaaron ko napunsak banaate the
 Akhir what is the reason that these Baba take unethical steps like making their own devotees impotent
 400 saadhuon ko napunsak banayagauratlab he ki ram rahim ke purv driver khatta singh ne 2007 main ek tivi channel ke khulaase main kaha tha kiraam rahim ke ashramame mahilaon kaa sirf yon shoshan hi nahin balki saadhuon ko napunsak banaaya jaataa he
 Hansraj Chauhan, a saint in the Dera Sacha Sauda, had filed a petition in the High Court on 17 July 2012, accusing Ram Rahim of impotenting 400 sadhus between 2000 and 2005
 doctor ke jariye banaae jatenpunskaunhone kaha ki deraa pramukh ke ishaare par deraa aspataal ke doctoron kii timsdhuon ko napunskabanaati hai
 He also named 166 sages
 hansraj ne kaha t sadhu baba use parthana ke baad nashe ke capsule detaa tha
 After that, what happened to him did not even know
 patrkaar ke hatyare sadhu bhi napansukafatehabad ke kasbaa tohana ke rahane vaale hansraj chouhan kii yachika main yah bhi bataaya tha ki patrkaar ramchandra chhatrapati hatyakand main aaropee nirmal or kuldeep bhi deraa sachcha sauda ke napunsak sadhu hai
 The interlocutors of the dera, who are imprisoned, admitted during interrogation that they were impotent, but they were made of their own free will
 yah maamla philhal adaalat main vichaaradhin he
 Asaram was also accused of impotent sexual harassment case Asaram is also accused of being impotent
 asaram ke ek purv sevadaar shivnath ne aarope lagaaya tha ki asaram apni daawaaon se sevadaaron ko napunsak banaate hai
 Shivnath said that Asaram used to make the medicine of eunuchs through herbs
 sevadaaron ko yah dawa khaane ke liye majaboor kiya jaataa tha
 Why do eunuchs socialist Professor Imtiaz Ahmad says that today's Mardan Baba makes eunuchs for the purpose of keeping their devotees as slaves
 taaki vah maansik rup ke saath-saath shaareerik rup se bhi unka gulam bana rahe
 The reason behind making a eunuch is also that all the desires of human beings should be abolished, so that they can sacrifice their family, home and family and keep them as slaves
 napunsak banaakar unki manosthiti par dharmik adambar ke jariye kabja karnaa he
 Devotees do not become slaves and sexually abused Professor Imtiaz says that which is the principle of devotion
 is parampara main bhakt guru ke saamne samarpan hokar uski bhakthi main leen ho jaataa he
 But today's modern Babans have completely changed the doctrine of bhakti
 inhone dharm kaa galat istemaal karke or apane bhakton ko gulam banaakar rakhte hai or unka maansik-shaareerik shoshan karte hai
 This is the reason that most of the babas of today are facing sexual abuse cases
 unki shahanshaahiyat ko chunauti na de sakeunhone kaha ki asaram apni mardaana kshamta badhaane ke liye dawaae khaataa tha, to duusari taraf apane sevadaaron ko napunsak banaata
 The reason behind this was that no one could challenge his eminence
 isi madde najar wo sabhi hatkande apanaae jate hai , jisase bhakt puri jindagi uskaa das banakar unki gulaami karata rahe hai or unke har galat sahi kaam par khamosh rahe he

 NOTA Rajya Sabha elections have been going on since 2014, but the Congress has challenged in 2017
 jabaki 2014 se ab tak gujarat samet 25 rajyasabha chunaav NOTA se ho chuke hai
 The Election Commission also said in its affidavit that it was only in 2014 that all the political parties were informed about the provision of NOTA in the ballot paper

 is dauraan supreme court ne gujarat congress se kai sawaal kiye the
 The court had said that the Election Commission issued the notification in January 2014 and now August 2017 is going on, meanwhile Rajya Sabha elections were held but you never challenged it? Today you are challenging NOTA because it does not suit you
 supreme court ne kaha ki chunaav ayog ne 14 july ko chunaav notification jari kiya tha tab bhi aapane chunauti nahin di
 Now that elections have come, they are challenging
 supreme court ne congress se kaha tha ki aap raajnneetik party hai or koi bhi vidhayak ise chunauti de saktaa tha
 But you cannot wait until you are being affected
 yah bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie ki nota kaa 2014 kaa notification chunaav ayog ne sabhi rajyon ke liye kiya tha na ki gujarat ke liye
 On behalf of Congress, Kapil Sibal had told the court that NOTA is the receiver of corruption
 gujarat main ab chunaav ho rahe hai to wo court main ise chunauti de rahe hai
 The Supreme Court is taking action on a petition by Gujarat Congress Chief Whip against the use of NOTA in the Gujarat Rajya Sabha election

 ’ There is nothing wrong in accepting that there are some things in our lives that we do not share with anyone
 apane jeevanasathi se bhi nahin
 This applies equally to both women and men
 mahilaon kii baat karen to unke liye aksar kaha jaataa he ki aurat ke man kii baat samaj paanaa bahut mushkil he
 There are some such things in every woman's life which she does not like to share with anyone
 apni is baat ko sahi tehraane ke liye mahilaon ke paas apane kaaran bhi hote hai
 Yes, but it also cannot be denied that there is no sense of hurt in the things she hides
 kai baaten to aisi bhi hoti hai jo vaapane pati ko bhi bataanaa pasand nahin karti hai
 Here are 7 such things that a woman does not like to share with her husband: 1
 mahilaayein apane pati ko kabhi bhi ye nahin bataati hai ki unhen un khaas palon main kaisaa laga
 Even if she tells, it is not completely true
 2
 Although not physical, women never forget their first love
 par ye baat wo apane pati ko kabhi nahin bataati hai ki unke man main ab bhi uske liye soft corner he
 3
 ye baat zyaadaatar mahilaon ke cese main sach he
 Almost every woman has a secret crush that she does not like to share with anyone
 ho saktaa he ki wo ye raaj apni us saheli ko bataa de jis par use puraa bharosa ho lekin apane pati ko ye baat kabhi nahin bataati
 4
 pati-patni ke bich kai aisi baaten hoti hai jinhen lekar donon ke bich sahmati nahin ban paati he
 But sometimes she joins her husband's yes to avoid fight and stress
 man hi man to wo is faisle ke khilaaf hoti he par chehre se jaahir nahin hone detii he
 5
 ye ek aisi baat he jo zyaadaatar mahilaayein apane patiyon se chhipaati hai
 She never tells him the truth about her illness
 wo nahin chaahati hai ki unki beemaari kaa jaanakar unke pati pareshaan hon
 6
 har mahila ke paas ek chipa hua khajaana hota he
 Which she saves while managing the small and big expenses of the house
 haalanki is rakam ke bare main pati ko koi jaankaree to nahin hoti he lekin jarurat padane par patni wo rakam pati ko dene se peeche bhi nahin hatati he
 7
 mahilaayein apni saheliyon ko sabakuch bataa detii hai lekin pati ko hameshaa yahi kahati hai ki usne ye baat kisi se nahin kahi he

 00 am:aaj sachin tendulkar kaa janmdin he
 Sachin is celebrating his 40th birthday today
 sachin tendulkar par vishesh The Supreme Court said on Monday that if a temple does not have constitutional rights, it cannot ban the entry of women
 supreme court kerala ke sabarimala main ayappa mandir maamle kii sunwaayee 8 farvari ko karegaa
 Actually, the entry of women between 10 years and 50 years is banned in this temple
 ye pratha saalon se chal rahi he
 Women lawyers have filed a petition in the Supreme Court against this
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki ye bain unke samanta ke adhikaar kaa ulanghan karata he
 While the temple board has argued that this practice has been going on for years and the Kerala High Court has also ruled in favor of the temple board
 tippaniyan The Kerala government said in the court that it is ready to file its affidavit supporting the ban on the entry of women
 yachikakarta yang loyrs association ne kaha ki pehle kii sarkaar ne mahilaon ke pravesh par apni sahmati jataai thi, jabaki vartmaan sarkaar iskaa virodh kar rahi he
 The court said that if the government is doing so, it is taking a risk
 sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne kaha ki dharm ke aadhaar ko chhodkar mandir prashasan mahilaon yaa kisi or ke pravesh par pabandi nahin laga saktaa, jab tak mandir ko kisi tarah kaa sanvaidhanik adhikaar praapt na ho
 However, the court said that it will hear the case on 8 February
 darasal is mandir main 10 saal se 50 saal ke bich kii mahilaon ke pravesh par bain lagaaya gaya he
 This practice has been going on for years
 iske khilaaf mahila vakeelon ne supreme court main yachika daakhil kii he
 The petition states that the ban violates their right to equality
 jabaki mandir ke board ne daleel di he ki ye pratha saalon se chali aa rahi he or ise lekar kerala hoicourt ne bhi mandir board ke paksh main faisla sunaaya he
 The comments kerala sarkaar ne court main kaha ki vah mahilaon ke pravesh par bain ke samarthan ko lekar apana halafanama daakhil karne ko taiyaar he
 Petitioner Young Lawyers Association stated that the earlier government had agreed to the entry of women, while the present government is opposing it
 court ne kaha ki agar sarkaar aisa kar rahi he, to vah jokhim le rahi he
 During the hearing, the Supreme Court held that the temple administration cannot ban the entry of women or anyone else except on the basis of religion, unless the temple has some kind of constitutional right
 haalanki nyaayalay ne kaha ki is maamle main vah 8 farvari ko sunwaayee karegaa

 kishwar bhi bahut majubatahain lekin unke saath sirf yah dikkat he ki vah yah nahin dekhati hai ki unhen kya bolnaa he
 ' pichley maheene kii hi to baat he jab team india champion bani
 But what reached the West Indies from England, the situation completely changed
 westeindies main khele ja rahe trikoniya siries ke apane pehle mukaable main bharat ko mejabaan team ke haathon haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 But after the crushing defeat against Sri Lanka in the second match, questions are being raised whether it is the same champion team? In the match played on Tuesday, Sri Lanka defeated India by 161 runs
 srilanka ne bharat ke saamne jeet ke liye 349 ran kaa lakshya rakhaa
 The entire team of India chasing this goal 44
 5 overon main sirf 187 ran par simat gai
 There is only one question in the mind of every cricket fan, what has happened so soon that such a decline is being seen in the performance of the team
 team india kii is sharmnaak haar ke kai vajah hai
 Let us know the reason for this
 
 
 fail rahaa top order, khuli middle order kii polajab srilanka ne bharat ke saamne 349 ranon kaa asambhav jaisaa lakshya rakhaa tab har kisi kii nigahen team ke top order par thi
 But just after Rohit Sharma's wicket fell on the score of 12 runs, India's troubles started
 iske shikhar dhawan (24) or murali vijay (30) bhi balle se khaas kamaal nahin kar sake
 The situation was so bad that India lost 4 wickets for a score of just 65 runs
 kharaab shuruyaat ke baad daaromadar middle order par tha, par captain kohli to maatr 2 ran ke nijee score par pavilion laut gaye
 Raina and Jadeja tried to handle the innings, but their effort could not even bring Team India to a respectable position
 aisi gendbaaji kaa kya karoge?captain kohli ne toss jitkar jab srilanka ko pehle ballebaaji karne kaa nyauta diya to ranneeti saaf thi
 Take advantage of the helpful pitch and give Sri Lanka an early setback
 par aisa nahin hua
 Indian bowlers failed to return Sri Lankan openers to the pavilion
 is naakaami ke baad to maanon wicket kaa sookhaa sa pad gaya
 Sri Lanka's first wicket 38
 4 over main gira
 Sri Lanka's score at this time was 213 runs
 puri match main bhartiya gendbaajon ne ek maatr wicket hi hasil kiya
 Death overs have been the biggest problem of Indian bowling in the last overs
 akasar hi hamaare gendbaajon kii yah kamajori team par hi baari padati he
 Something similar happened in the match against Sri Lanka
 bhartiya gendbaajon ne srilankai pari ke aakhri 16 over main 180 ran lutaae
 124 runs in the last 10 overs and 66 runs in the last 5 overs
 ye aankaden bataate hai ki team india kii gendbaaji deth over main kis tarah se bikhar jaati he
 Magic is not under the captaincy of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, if not Mahi
 is toornament main yah baat sahi sabit ho rahi he
 What Dhoni got injured, the team's performance started falling
 pehle match main to windies ke khilaaf romaanchak muqabla hua, par captain dhoni kii kami maidan par jarur khali
 The real impact of his lack was seen in the match against Sri Lanka
 kohli apane gendbaajon or ballebaajon se vaisaa pradarshan nahin karvaa sake jo team ko jeet dilaa sake
 In contrast to Dhoni, Kohli's decisions proved to be overwhelming on Team India, whether it was to win the toss and invite Sri Lanka to bat first or the bowling strategy
 america main bharat ke rajdoot ne kaha he ki america media kaa ek tabaka, khaastaur se udaaravaadi dhada kashmir par ekatarfa tasviir dikhaa rahaa he
 This is being done at the behest of those parties who are working against Indian interests
 bhartiya rajdoot harshavardhan shringla ne kaha ki bharat dwaara pichley maheene jammu kashmir ke vishesh darje ko samaapt kar use do centre shasit pradeshon main vibhajit karne kaa faisla logon kii ‘‘bhalaai''ke liye kiya gaya he
 The Indian diplomat described Article 370 giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir as "anarchist provision" which was "suffocating" the economy and giving impetus to Pakistani terrorism
 ''alibaba founder jaik maa wig or guitar ke saath aae nazar, apane ferewel par kiya dhamaakedaar dance, dekhen videounhomne kaha, ‘‘durbhagyavash, america main media ke ek tabake khaastaur se udaaravaadi tabake ne apane hi kaarnon se, mudde ke is paridrishy ko saamne nahin laane kaa vikalp chunaa he jabaki yah paridrishy behad mahatvapurn he
 "instead," he said, "they are focusing on that aspect of the picture that has been pushed forward by those parties who hate our interests

 Trump ended Afghanistan peace talks with Taliban, Trump said - made a mistake
 
 
 bhartiya rajdoot ke anusaar, kashmir main haalia badlaavon se maahaul behatar hoga or yah kadam jammu kashmir ke logon ke hit main hoga
 He said that this would help the people of the state to regain their rights which they were "deprived of for decades"
 ''unhone kaha, ‘‘ is vichaar se ham rubaru karaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Shringla posted a lengthy video on youtube last week highlighting the "real reasons" for changes in Jammu and Kashmir's status

 Despite the permission, Rahul Gandhi rushed to Saharanpur with Congress leaders on the insistence of going to Saharanpur
 padhie rahul ke daure ko lekar din bhar chali uthapatak kii timeline
 
 
 According to Rahul Gandhi's schedule, he was supposed to come to Saharanpur via Yamunanagar from 12 to 12:30
 isse kaaphi pehle congress netaa pi el puniya, imran masood vagairah border par bane yamuna pal par kaaryakartaaon ke saath maujuud the
 To stop Rahul, the administration put up a large number of police forces to stop the Congress Vice President
 bairicade lagaakar khud ediji lau and order, aiji jone, saharanpur ke jiladhikari, saharanpur ke esaspi sab maukey par maujuud the
 All the vehicles were being checked before Rahul's arrival
 isaki vajah se yamunanagar or saharanpur ke bich bane yamuna pul par baari jam lag gaya
 When Punia and Imran were asked why Rahul was coming despite not being allowed, the Congress leaders said that all this was being done with carelessness and willfulness of the administration
 punjabi dhabas par prashasan ne kiya puraa intjampahale ye tay tha ki rahul ijazat nahin hone ke baavjood yamuna pal tak aaenge or aage badhane kii koshish karenge
 a picket was installed near the bridge, but in a short time, Imran Masood said that the administration has made all arrangements on a Punjabi dhaba built about 1 km ahead of the bridge
 kareeb 2 baje rahul yamuna pal par pahunche or vahaan bhi police ne unhen rokane kii koshish kii, jahaan police se unki halki nok-jhonk hui
 The administrative attack became a shield and after this, Rahul and other leaders proceeded to come to the dhaba on foot
 saath main unke dheron samarthak bhi chal rahe the
 On the way forward these people stopped the road / highway on both sides
 saharanpur ke andar dhabas ke paas puraa prashasnic amala ek dhaal bana kar taiyaar khadaa tha
 All the top officers themselves were ready wearing helmets, etc
 rahul gandhi dhai baje dhabas par pahunche
 There was a lot of offers, because the place was very small, in which Rahul was meeting the families of the victims
 rahul kii suraksha main lage espiji ke javaanon se bhi media karmiyon kii nok jhonk hui
 Will Rahul Gandhi only meet Dalits? After stopping for an hour and a half, Rahul came out and sat in the car
 baaki netaa bhi unke saath ho liye
 After 5 minutes, then got out of the car and went to the toilet of the dhaba and went back to the place where he was sitting earlier
 yahaan unhone ab mediakarmiyon se baat kii
 After this, Rahul Gandhi started going, then the person of Rajput community said in a loud voice whether only the Dalits will meet
 usee dauraan ek dalit samudaay kaa vyakti bhi aa gaya
 Punia said - Both wanted to meet the community
 a Rajput man speaking in Rahultej's voice was calling himself a Congress worker, when PL Punia was questioned, he said that Rahul Gandhi wanted to meet both communities
 wo saamaajik sauhaard ke liye aae the, lekin prashasan ne unhen milane nahin diya
 Punia said that the man who is making noise is a man of BJP and not of Congress

 Digvijay Singh wanted his brother to contest against Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan from Budni so that he would remain in the eyes of the party high command
 lekin lakshmana ko chunaav ladane se sidhe sonia gandhi ne hi manaa kar diya he
 This is considered to be a big blow to the political life of Digvijay Singh

 lakshmana singh lambey samay tak bijepi main rahane ke baad congress main waapas aae the
 In fact, the market price of Digvijay Singh, who was having Rahul's nose till the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, has been falling continuously since the defeat in Uttar Pradesh, but no one had any idea that such bad days would come that brother's ticket would be cut

 The launch of Chandrayaan 2 at the last minute was postponed due to technical fault
 isro (ISRO) ke sutron ke mutabik, antim samay main cryogenic stage main itnaa pressure nahin ban paa rahaa tha jitna apekshit tha
 The reason for this was stated to be the leakage problem in helium used in cryogenic engines
 jiske baad 56 minute 24 second pehle lonching ko taalane kaa faisla liya gaya tha
 After that ISRO scientists understood the problem and after resolving the problem, within 7 days decided to launch Chandrayaan 2 on July 22

 par ab un baigon se maasoom bachapan main angadaeeyaan le rahe bacchon kii jhuki peeth aane vaale samay main aapako shaayad hi dekhne ko mili
 The Maharashtra government has now decided to reduce the weight of children's bags
 bag par sakht sarkaarmaharashtra sarkaar ke afasaron ne baari baagon se bacchon kiridh kii haddi par bura prabhavapadane ko lekar pehle hi chetaya tha
 On which the government has taken a strong decision, limiting the size of the bag
 ab bachche ke vajan se 10 fisadi se zyada baari bag naa hone kii baat kahi gai he
 Relief for children? If the average weight of the child is 30 kg, then the weight of the bag should not be more than 3 kg in any case
 sarkaar ke is faisle se soobe ke bacchon ke liye badi raahat hogi
 India has dragged the US into the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement system on the issue of imposing import duties on aluminum and steel
 bharat ne kaha he ki in utpaadon par aayaat shulk lagane ke america ke faisle se uskaa niryaat prabhavit hoga
 The US move is not in compliance with global trade regulations
 adhikari ne kaha, ‘‘america dwaara kuch ispaat or aluminium utpaadon par aayaat shulk lagaaye jane ke mudde par bharat ne dablutio ke tahat vivaad niptaan main maamla daayar kiya he
 India has insisted on negotiating with the US in the case
 bharat ne kaha he ki vichaar vimarsh kisi bhi vivaad ke niptaan kaa pehla kadam he
 If the two countries could not reach any mutual agreement after negotiation, then India would ask the WTO Dispute Settlement Committee to look into the matter
 tippaniyan US President Donald Trump imposed a heavy duty on steel and aluminum imports on 9 March
 trump ke is kadam se vaishvik vyapaar yuddh chhidane kii ashanka duniyabar main paidaa ho gai
 Trump signed two orders imposing a duty of 25 percent on imports of steel products and 10 percent on aluminum imports
 haalanki canada or mexico ko in utpaadon par aayaat shulk se chhot di gai
 India has also demanded a waiver from the US to impose import duties on these products

 america ke raashtrapati donald trump ne 9 march ko ispaat or aluminium ke aayaat par baari shulk laga diya tha
 This move of Trump created a worldwide fear of a global trade war
 trump ne do adeshon par hastakshar kiye jisamen ispaat utpaadon ke aayaat par 25 pratishat or aluminium aayaat par 10 pratishat shulk lagaaya gaya
 However, Canada and Mexico were exempted from import duties on these products

 america ne apane ak faisle se china ko chintaa main daal diya he darasal america videsh vibhaag ne taiwan ko 1
 Approved to sell 42 billion dollars worth of weapons
 donald trump ke raashtrapati banane ke baad se is aatmshaasi desh ke saath yah apni tarah kaa pehla sauda he
 Because the US has so far been adopting a 'one China' policy with China under which the US considers China a nation in which Taiwan is not a separate country
 hathiyaaron kii bikrise china puri tarah naaraaz ho saktaa he, kyonki china taiwan ko apana hi hissaa maanata aayaa he
 The decision was taken by the US at a time when the United States has consistently asked China to stop efforts to impose a nuclear weapons embargo on North Korea, so the deal comes at a critical time that could affect Washington and Beijing's relations
 Huh
 ek america adhikari ne naam ujagar nahin karne kii shart par bataaya ki purv chetavanee radar sametataivanko beche jane vaale hathiyaaron main saat prakaar ke hathiyaar hai, jisamen radiation-rodhi missile, tarpedo or esaem-2 missile ke kalpurje aadi shaamil hai
 State Department spokesman Heather Nart said yesterday that the Trump administration gave Congress about 1
 42 arab dollar mulya ke saat prastaavit saudon ko manjuuri dene ke iraade ke bare main suchit kar diya he
 Nart pointed out that approving these deals does not violate the Taiwan Relations Act relating to Taiwan and US relations
 gauratlab he ki america raashtrapati trump uttar korea par lagaam kasne main china se madad kii maang karte rahe hai
 Businessmen and industrialists are often accused of influencing government policies by using parliamentary procedure
 kaarobaari hiton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue saansadon dwaara kuch prerit prashn kiye jate hai or chitthiyaan likhi jaati hai
 However, this is the entire way of using the parliamentary process for business benefits
 inamen se kuch tareeke samay ke saath benakaab ho chuke hai or sansadeey vyavastha kuch tareekon ke prati agaah ho chuki he
 a new way of influencing policies is somewhat different from them
 maujuuda samay main badi sankhya main varisht adhivaktaa sansad main sadsy hai
 Most political parties prefer them because they make it easier to win the debate of the Parliament along with the work of the court
 iskaa praasangik asar yah dekhne ko mila ki adhivaktaa saansadon ne court ke aapasi vivaad ko sansadeey prakriya main ghaseetne kaa kaam kiya
 The impeachment motion brought against the country's Chief Justice is an example of this
 kyon galat he ye mahabhiyog?mahabhiyog kaa prastaav aise durlabh maamalon main kiya jaataa he jahaan kisi jaj ke duraachaar kaa gambhir prakaran ho or uske khilaaf thos or paryaapt saboot maujuud hon
 But mere utterances and rumors cannot be made the basis of impeachment motion
 maujuuda mahabhiyog prastaav bina kisi thos subut ke laayaa gaya he or iskaa makasad sarvocch nyaayalay main mukhya nyaayadhish samet anya jajon ko daraana he
 The Congress Party knows this task very well how to dispute the judges whose decisions will not benefit the Congress
 ek saamaanya sa raajnneetik jaankaar bhi yah jaanata he ki maujuuda mahabhiyog prastaav ko sansad main do-tihaai bahumat nahin mil saktaa
 That is why the purpose of Congress through this resolution was not to remove the Chief Justice but to intimidate other judges including him
 kamjor tha prastaav kaa draftvipaksh dwaara laayaa gaya mahabhiyog prastaav kaa draftbehad kamjortha
 The basis of such sensitive drafts where it was necessary to be free from errors was to be a strong proof
 lekin draft yadi saboot khojane kii baat kare, jaanch kii baat kare to jaahir he ki mahabhiyog prastaav ke liye paryaapt daleel nahin he
 Rationale 1: 64 Members of Parliament propose that the Chief Justice of India may possibly indulge in corruption
 daleel 2:sansad ke 64 sadsy prastaav main daawa karte hai ki desh ke mukhya nyaayadhish 'jaanch ke ghere main aa sakate the'
 Is this just a guess or is there any evidence of this? daleel 3:mahabhiyog prastaav laane vaale 64 saansad likhte hai ki 'aisa prathit hota he ki mukhya nyaayadhish ne back date main prashasnic aadesh paarit kiya'
 Is it just on the basis of doubt? Argument 4: Can a 33-year-old case of allotment of land to an advocate be proved to be a misconduct proved against the Chief Justice? Argument 5: Should the judges have a second view of allotting the case or Keeping an alternative view is proven misconduct? The Congress party is arguing that the verification of their charge against the Chief Justice can be done only after investigation
 Purpose of the impeachment motion on the ground is different from passing it in Parliament? is computer se kai tarah ke kaam liye ja sakate hai or iskaa istemaal kai uddeshyon ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 The team that produced it decided to use it for clarity of temperature criteria
 kuch adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki saamaanya uttak se tumor zyada garm hote hai
 Not enough data was available to prove this
 taapmaana se cancer ke ilaaj kaa pataa lagane main bhi madad mil saktaa he
 In Jammu and Kashmir, terrorists have once again attacked a woman while acting cowardly
 aatankiyon ne shanivaar shaam ko dakshini kashmir ke pulavama kasbe main simran jaan naam kii mahila ko goli markar ghayal kar diya
 Simran is currently undergoing treatment at Bone and Joint Hospital in Srinagar
 bataa den ki simran jaan pulavama main 3 saal sebeauty parlorchala rahi hai
 What is the reason for the attack? Actually, despite repeated threats from terrorists, Simran is running a beauty parlor in Pulwama town
 isi ranjish ke chalate aatankiyon ne jaanaleva hamalaa kiya he
 This is not the first time this has happened
 pichley saal bhi simran ke beauty parlor par grenade se hamalaa kiya gaya tha
 Only the shop was damaged in this attack
 philhalapulicemaamle kii tafteesh kar rahi he lekin shaq kii sui hijbul mujahidin par ja rahaa he
 Let us know that Hizbul Mujahideen had told women in some areas of Pulwama a few days ago not to go to army programs and beauty parlors especially
 esasabi ke bunker ko banaaya tha nishanisase pehle shuukravaar ko srinagar ke mehjoor nagar main aatankiyon ne esasabi ko nishaanaa banaaya
 The terrorists attacked the ssb's bunker with a grenade
 vahiin mangalvaar ko jammu-kashmir ke sopor main aatankiyon ne siarpief ke kafile par grenade se hamalaa kiya tha
 Two soldiers were injured in this, who were admitted to the hospital
 bataa den ki beete kai dinon se aatankiyon ne apni ranneeti main badlaav kiya he
 Now they are directly targeting the security forces and their families
 madhyapradesh kii shivaraj singh sarkaar dwaara paanch baabaaon ko rajyamantri kaa darja die jane par hoicourt ne jawaab talab kiya he
 The petition filed in the Indore bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court was heard on Monday
 khandpeeth ke nyaayadhish gana nyaayamurti pi
 K
 jaiswal, nyaayamurti susheel avasthi ne sarkaar se teen hafte main jawaab dene ko kaha he
 Explain that after this decision of the state government, a person named Rambahadur filed a petition
 us dauraan unhone kaha tha ki sarkaar ne jin santon ko rajya mantri kaa darja diya he, vah sabhi narmada andolan chhedane vaale the
 But before that he was made Minister of State
 ye baba bane hai rajyamantriapako bataa den ki beete mangalvaar ko shivaraj sarkaar ne bhayyuji maharaj samet paanch santon ko rajyamantri kaa darja diya tha
 The government had confirmed this by issuing an 'order letter'
 sarkaar ne samiti ke sadsy narmadanandji, hariharaanandji, computer babaaji, bhayyuji maharaj or yogendra mahantji ko rajya sarkaar main rajyamantri str kaa darja pradaan kiya he
 And the trip was canceled
 
 
 gauratlab he ki santon ne beete 28 march ko elaan kiya tha ki vah narmada ghotaalaa rath yatra nikaalenge
 During this period, they were imposed by the government in 45 districts of the state
 5 karod paudhon kii ginati karaayenge
 But the trip was canceled before it started
 rahul ne bhi kiya tha warcongress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne bhi is mudde par shivaraj sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 Rahul tweeted in a poem style

 unhone kaha ki ek baar puri report aa jane ke baad hi is ghatana par vistrut tippanee karnaa uchit hoga
 The comments gyatavya he ki jharkhand kii rajdhani ranchi se lagbhag sava dau sau kilometre dur giridih main giridih-dhanbad rajmarg par shaam lagbhag chaar baje mohanpur main ghaat lagaae lagbhag sau naksaliyon ne sthaneey adaalat se peshi ke baad laut rahe khoonkhaar naksaliyon samet 32 kaidiyon se bhare jail vaahan par hamalaa kar apane aath maovadi saathiyon ko chhudaa liya

 ramlila maidan main satyagrah kar rahe logon ke khilaaf barbartapurna karrwai karne ke aaropon se ghiri centre sarkaar ab bhi chetane kaa naam nahin le rahi he
 This time the Congress is using technology to deal with Anna Hazare's proposed fast
 majboot lokapal ke pairokaar samajasevi anna hajaare dwaara 16 agast se phir se anshan par baithne kii ghoshnaa ke baad ab congress ek nai chaal chal rahi he
 Congress has launched SMS campaign against the proposed movement
 logon ko +919212472681 mobile number se ek khaas esemes bheje ja rahe hai
 It is written in the SMS that if Anna Hazare sat on hunger strike on August 16, he would crush them like Baba Ramdev was crushed
 baat sirf itani hi nahin he
 The extent is reached when it is also written in SAM that 'forward to all'
 is sandesh se itnaa to spasht ho hi jaataa he yah prastaavit andolan ko kuchalane kii sochi-samajhi ranneeti ke tahat kiya ja rahaa he
 These messages are also being sent forcefully on the numbers without registering
 yah bhi apane-aap main kam bada jurm nahin he
 Those people who have taken the 'do Not Disturb' service are also sending these sams
 yun to anna hajaare kii muhim se judane kii chaah rakhane waalon ko bhi massej bheje gaye the, lekin iske liye pehle ek khaas number par missd kol karnaa jaruri hota tha
 Later the message used to come on that number
 lekin maujuuda maamla zyada ghaatak iraadon vaala maaloom padataa he
 Significantly, the people of corruption-stricken people have been expecting the government to bring the country out of the vicious cycle by bringing a strong Lokpal bill, but perhaps it is a mistake in the government's intention
 yahi vajah he ki centre sarkaar 'sarkari lokapal' ke paksh main he
 In such a situation, if Anna Hazare or Baba Ramdev questions the intent of the Congress, then what is the surprise? As far as public is concerned, she knows everything
 sirf jaanati hi nahin he, sahi avasar aane par sahi 'faisle' bhi suna detii he or siyaasi chaalen chalane vaale maharathi sir dhunate rah jate hai

 yah khushi kii baat he ki bharat main is baat ko lekar jaagrukta ai he ki yahaan 12,30,00,000 gharon main shauchalay nahin hai or 80,00,00,000 kii aabaadi khule main shouch karti he
 The government is also serious about this
 vaise to kisi vyakti kaa kisi duusare kaa shouch saaf karnaa kanuunan nishiddh he
 But in many parts of the country, some people, especially women, still clean the dirt of others with their hands
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kathan 'devalayas se purv shauchalay' or baad main 15 agast ke unke bhaashan main sampurna swatchta kaarykram ke tahat agle ek varsh main sabhi skulon main shauchalay tathaa 2019 tak khule main shouch ko khatm karne kii ghoshnaa ne desh main josh bhar diya he
 i am very happy that finally our leadership realized that India cannot become a great nation without getting rid of dirt
 swatchta ke bina vyakti sammaan or behatar swasthya hasil nahin kar saktaa
 It was with this vision that i started Sulabh in 1970
 yah dhire-dhire andolan main badal gaya or duniya main swatchta kaa kaam karne vaale gaiyr-sarkari sansthaanon main sabase bada he
 It has 60,000 voluntary workers
 hamaara andolan do pramukh uddeshyon par kendrit he: swatchta ke laagat-prabhavi upayon ke jariye paryaavaran or jal pradooshan ko rokna tathaa maanav-mel kii safai main lage asprishy kahe janevaale logon kii mukti or punarvaas
 So far we have built 12,00,000 domestic and 8,500 public toilets
 10,000 se adhik scavanjaron ko mukt karavaaya he
 By the way, even today the level of pollution is extremely high and the number of human-sewage cleaners is also large
 hamaare bahuaiami andolan ne dikhaaya he ki iskaa nidaan kaise hoga
 How i came to this field of social reform can be known from some incidents of my childhood
 meraa janm 1943 main bihar ke vaishali jile ke ek gaanv main ek ruudhivaadee brahmin parivaar main hua
 When i was 6 years old, i touched an alleged untouchable woman and my grandmother, who believed in orthodox untouchability, forcibly gave me cow dung and cow urine to cleanse
 uskaa kadava swaad aaj bhi mere munh main he
 i grew up in a big house, which had 9 rooms, but no toilet
 main sote hue yaa adrdhanidra main har subah kuch awaajen sunata tha
 Some were lifting buckets, some were filling water and women were going out to defecate before sunrise
 koi mahila biimaar pad jaati to use ek mitti ke bartan main hi shouch karnaa padataa tha
 Many women had a headache because they had to stop their defecation throughout the day
 maine yah sab dekha he
 i have also seen bowed eyes of men who used to sit in the open during the day for defecation
 mujhe baad main samaj aayaa, yahi kahani bharat ke 7,00,000 gaanvon or saikadon shaharon kii he
 i was educated in four schools
 unamem se kisi main bhi shauchalay nahin tha
 After graduating in Sociology from Patna University, i got a chance to work in the Department of Bhangi Mukti of the Bihar Gandhi Birth Centenary Celebration Committee in 1968-69
 samiti ne mujhe surakshit or sasti shauchalay takanic viksit karne or daliton ke sammaan ke liye kaam karne ko kaha taaki unhen mukhya dhara main shaamil kiya jaae
 It was considered a wrong step for a educated young man of a high caste
 lekin isane mere vyaktitv main bada badlaav kiya or mere jivan kaa rukh hi mode diya
 a new turning point in my life came when i moved to live among them for three months in the Dalit colony of Bettiah
 us samay desh main jati-pratha charam par thi
 While living with him i saw many things that opened my eyes
 is varg kii pidaa dardanaak thi
 Then i decided to dedicate my life to scavengers
 maine us apmaan or taanon ko nazarandaaj kiya jo mujh par aa rahe the
 Now the question before me was how to develop an effective and inexpensive toilet system as an alternative to the expensive urn and sewer system being used in Western countries, so that scavenging practice can be stopped and they can be rehabilitated for some other work
 main koi ejeeniyar yaa vaigyanik nahin tha
 Because of this the toilet-system was not suitable to be invented
 lekin maine apane dimag kaa istemaal kiya, gahan shodh kiya or is vishay par vishwa swasthya sanghathan kii kitaab kii madad se 1968 main ek tu-pit por-kalash, dyspojal compost shauchalay kaa avishkaar kiya, jo saraltapurvak sthaneey vastuon se, kam laagat par banaaya ja saktaa
 It was subsequently recognized as one of the best global techniques for the disposal of human waste at the national and international levels
 pehali baar isaki sarthakata dikhaane ke liye mujhe lanbaa sangharsh karnaa padaa
 In 1973 i got this opportunity
 shauchalay kaa prayog safal hua or isane logon kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya
 Encouraged by this, i developed the concept of community toilets in 1974 on the basis of 'payment and use' in urban areas
 ise sabase pehle bihar or phir puure bharat main lokapriyata mili
 Gradually i developed a practical policy on how a non-governmental organization can act as a catalyst between the government, local bodies, citizens and beneficiaries
 is raste ko apanaakar sulabh ne sarkari, gaiyr-sarkari sanghathan kii saajhedaari kaa safal udhaaharan diya
 Along with cleanliness, we opened schools in Patna, Delhi and elsewhere for the education of Dalit children which helped in scavenging and eradication of illiteracy
 mahilaon or bacchon ko aarthik avasar pradaan karne ke uddeshy se hamane vyavsaayik prashikshan-kendron kii sthapana kii he
 We took several cultural initiatives: We organized scavengers to visit temples, upper classes and scavengers to visit each other, interracial conferences and seminars with the aim of breaking caste-bonds
 isse jativaadee maansikta main badlaav aayaa, saamaajik bandhan shithil hue or jati-pratha ko todgaye kii prakriya shuru hui
 We have also established a vocational training center in Alwar, Rajasthan
 yahaan dalit mahilaon ko silaai, kadhai or beauty care main prashikshan diya jaataa he, jo pehle sir par mailaa dhone kaa kaam karti thim
 In 2008, we took nearly three dozen women trained in New York to attend a fashion show at the United Nations Headquarters to make an appearance in the International Year of Sanitation
 iske baad sulabh ne byogas, jaev-urvarak, drav or kachra-prabandhan, garibi-unmoolan ke kaam main padaarpan kiya
 We established Sulabh International Center for Action Sociology, Sulabh International Academy of Environmental Sanitation and a unique museum Museum of Toilets in Delhi
 yah prachinkaal kii shauchalayon kii vikaas kii kahani bataata he
 However, all the contributions Sulabh has made in the country are lost in the number of toilets, but our goal is not just toilets but social change and human development
 2019 tak khule main shouch kii parampara khatm karnaa sambhav he, lekin chunautiyaan adhik hai
 This will not be possible only with the coordination of the state and corporate houses, as the Prime Minister has indicated
 isamen jeevant logon kii bhagidaari or suniyojit yojanaon kii bhi jarurat he
 Toilets will be available in every household in the country if there is a political will to adopt sanitation as a national purpose and have the necessary capital and an effective movement with 50,000 trained motivators
 or tab ham 2019 tak khule main shouch ko alavida kah sakenge

 gilaani ne raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke maamalon ko phir se kholane ke liye swiss prashasan ko patr likhane se inkaar kar diya tha
 While the court directed him to do so

 a three-member bench of Khwaja and Justice Khilji Arif Hussain heard three constitutional petitions against the decision of National Assembly Speaker Fahmida Mirza

 aam aadmi party ke sansthaapak arvind kejariwal kaa media se prem khatm ho chalaa he or ab ve useepana dushman maanane lage hai or iskaa hi udhaaharan he samooche media ko jail bhej dene kii dhamkee
 Kejriwal has been angry for some time and his reason is clear that he does not want the media to show everything that hurts his image, rather he shows it which improves his image
 lekin samasya he ki media jise upar pahunchaata he uski galatiyon par use neeche bhi gira detaa he
 It is not even the nature of media to remain the same all the time
 kabhi kejariwal media ke dulaare the kyonkiunhone kai bade mudde uthaae or janata ke saath jude
 But later he formed his own political party and even after that he kept hoping that every step of his would be appreciated
 lekin vah khel kebasic niyam bhul gaye
 The media remains as soft on a non-political organization as it is not against political parties because it knows that their only aim is to gain power
 agaravind kejariwal yah duhai de rahe hai ki ve sabase eemaandaar hai or un par ungali uthaai hi na jaae toyah galat he
 They will have to bear the brunt of whatever they do wrong

 In such a situation, it is meaningless to spew venom against the media

 They now feel that they should be paid attention to what they say

 If they say wrong then they should not be ignored
 yani har haal main unke donohathon main laddu rahen
 In such a situation, being printed or shown anything that makes them angry, they are not friendly
 unki samasya he ki vah apane ko vishisht shrenee kaa raajnneetijna maanate hai
 And his concept of this particularity is making him fierce
 vah aam nahin rahe kyonki aam aadmi toalochanaon ko sahane ke liye hameshaa taiyaar rahata he, khaas nahin
 The common man struggles with such situations
 arvind kejariwal ab aam aadmi nahin hai, vah khaas ban chuke hai or yah bhadaas usee kaanatija he

 The second trial of the friendship of the SP-BSP, which was successful in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-elections in Uttar Pradesh, will now take place in the battlefield of Kairana
 chunaav ayog ne guuruuvaar ko kairana loksabhaa upachunaav kii tarikhon kaa elaan kar diya he

 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath or up-mukhyamantri keshav prasad maury is seat ko jitkar apni-apni siton par mili haar kaa sapa-basapa ke gathbandhan se badla lenaa chaahate hai
 At the same time, akhilesh-mayawati would like to retain her victory in Kairana also
 aise main kairana kii dharti par ek baar phir siyaasi yuddh kii bisaat bichaai jane lagi he
 Father's inheritance can be handled Daughter tell that Hukum Singh of BJP won the Kairana parliamentary seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 isi saal 3 farvari ko unka nidhan ho jane ke chalate upachunaav ho rahaa he
 It is believed that the BJP can field Hukum Singh's daughter Mriganka Singh from this seat
 mriganka ko pita kii maut kii vajah se sahanubhuti vot mil saktaa he
 However, Mriganka has tried her luck in the assembly elections but had to beat sp's Nahid Hasan
 vipaksh kii kashmakashbaspa upachunaav main na ladane ke vaade par kaayam he
 In such a situation, only SP, Congress and RLD can field their candidates from the opposition
 saharanpur se congress ke netaa imran masood kairana se chunavi ranbhumi main utarane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 If sources are to be believed, Imran has given his victory equation to the Congress high command, but due to his fundamentalist image, the party is reluctant to field him
 jabaki sapa apane ummidavaar ko lekar manthan main juty he
 Akhilesh wants to bet on a candidate who can put this seat in the sp's bag
 vidhansabha chunaav kaa samikarnakairana loksabhaa seat ke tahat paanch vidhansabha siten aati hai
 This Lok Sabha seat consists of Thanabhavan, Kairana and Shamli assembly seats in Shamli district, Gangoh and Nakur assembly seats in Saharanpur district
 maujuuda samay main in paanch vidhansabha siton main chaar bijepi ke paas hai or kairana vidhansabha seat sapa ke paas he
 The BJP received 4 lakh 33 thousand votes in these seats in 2017
 jabaki basapa pratyaashiyon ko 2 lakh 8 hajaar or sapa ke 3 pratyaashiyon ko 1 lakh 6 hajaar vot mili the
 The SP gave Shamli and Nakur seats to the Congress
 kairana loksabhaa kii siyasat itihascarana loksabhaa seat 1962 main vajood main ai
 Since then elections have been held 14 times
 inamen congress or bijepi do-do baar chunaav jeet saki hai
 These seats have been going into the account of different political parties
 kairana loksabhaa seat par pehali baar hue chunaav main nirdaleey ummidavaar ke taur par yashpal singh ne jeet darj kii thi
 Socialist Party in 1967, Congress in 1971, Janata Party in 1977, Janata Party (secular) in 1980, Congress in 1984, Congress in 1989, 1991, SP in 1996, BJP in 1998, Rashtriya Lok Dal in 1999 and 2004, BSP in 2009 And in 2014, BJP has won
 kairana kaa jaateey samikarnakairana loksabhaa seat par 17 lakh matadaata hai jinamein paanch lakh muslim, chaar lakh becoward (jat, gurjar, saini, kashyap, prajapati or anya shaamil) or dedh lakh vot jatav dalit he or 1 lakh ke kareeb gairjatav dalit matadaata hai
 The Kairana seat is considered to be Gurjar-dominated
 yahaan teen lakh gurjar matadaata hai inamen hindu-muslim donon gurjar shaamil hai
 That is why the candidates of Gurjar community have won this seat most of the times
 kairana main muslim siyasatkairana main muslim aabaadi acchhee khaasi hone ke baad bhi 14 loksabhaa chunaav main mahaj 4 baar hi muslim saansad bane hai
 There were two Muslim candidates against Hukum Singh of BJP in the 2014 election
 sapa ne nahid hasan ko or basapa ne kanvar hasan ko utaara tha
 In 2013, the Muzaffarnagar riots led to polarization of votes and Hukum Singh benefited from the Muslim vote split due to the presence of two Muslim candidates
 voton kaa sameekarnabijapi ko 5 lakh 65 hajaar 909 vot mili the
 While SP 3 lakh 29 thousand 81 votes and BSP 1 lakh 60 thousand 414 votes
 aise main agar sapa-basapa ke vot jod liye jaaen to bhi bijepi aage he
 But the story of 2014 and 2018 is different
 2017 main agar sapa-basapa ko mili vot dekhe jaaen or uske hisaab se upachunaav kaa andaja lagaaya jaae to sapa-basapa kii dosti, bijepi par baari pad sakati he
 What will happen if this happens, the original vote of the SP in Kairana is low, but the population of Muslims is large, which is considered as the vote bank of the SP
 jabaki isi seat par dalit vot kaaphi ahm hai
 Like the previous by-elections of UP, if the bsp's vote goes to the sp's seat, then there can be difficulties for the BJP
 jabaki bijepi ek baar apane maton ko ekajute karke 2014 jaisaa itihaas dohraane kii koshish karegi
 a surprising case of molestation and police negligence has come to light in Delhi

 The girls tell Maliwal that the boys play the city after watching them and chase them
 ladakiyon ne daawa kiya he ki un logon ne kai baar police se shikaayat kii
 But despite this no action was taken
 ladakiyon ne bataaya ki ve ladke ghar jate samay unka peechha karte hai
 According to the agency language, the girls say they are afraid to tell their parents about this despite so much insult, because they are afraid that their school will be stopped
 ab ayog ne ladakiyon kii shikaayat par sangyaan lete hue aage karrwai karne kaa aashwaasan diya he

 php kanvarjan charge jamaa karaane ko lekar ab utari dilli nagar nigam ne dilli kii purana market sadar bazaar ilaake main bhi kai duukaandaaron ko notice diya he jisko lekar duukaandaaron me dar bhi he, jisamen dukandaaron ko kanvarjan charge jamaa karne ko kaha gaya he, nahin to ection lene kaa zikr he, jisamen ceiling bhi shaamil he
 Shopkeepers say how MCD can do sealing in this area, because the area of sadar Bazar comes in the special area of delhi from where conversion charges cannot be charged
 tryder association ke adhyaksh narendra gupta ne kaha he sadar bazaar kaaphi purana he jahaan koi nayaa consatruction nahi he to phir emsidi kaise canvarjan charge le sakati he, ab inkaa kahana he ki agar maamla zyada badhata he, to wo is maamle ko emsidi netaaon se milakar baat karengen
 Following an order of the Central Government, shops running on mixed land use or commercial roads and those carrying on business activities have been given exemption to deposit conversion etc
 by January 15
 lekin iske baavjood north emsidi ke building vibhaag ne dukandaaron ko yah charge jamaa karaane ke notice jari kar die hai
 Notices were issued recently in the streets of Chandni Chowk
 ab aria kii sabase badi market sadar bazaar ke dukandaaron ko notice jari kar die gaye hai
 The notice states that they should submit their conversion charge etc
 within three days, otherwise action will be taken against them
 isamen ceiling bhi shaamil he
 The president of the traders association, Narendra Gupta, said that even 10 years ago, sealing was done in the market on the orders of the Supreme Court
 master plan-2021 puraani dilli ke chandani chowk, sadar-pahadganj jone ko special aria ghoshit kiya gaya he, jiske tahat emsidi in ilaakon se kanvarjan charge nahi le sakate hai
 So at the same time, according to the MCD Sutras, conversion charges will have to be paid by everyone, but due to the old area, some relief has been given, according to which, if there is a shop before 1962, no charge will be paid
 isliye agar notice diya gaya he ki iskaa matlab koi bhi dukandaar agar chhut kaa adhikari bananaa he to phir logon ko ye sabit karnaa hoga ki dukaan 1962 se pehle ke hai, nahin to charge dena hoga
 On the other hand, sources say that North MCD officials are waiting till January 15
 is tithi tak puraani dilli ke jis bhi dukandaar ne kanvarjan charge jamaa kara diya he to use baksh diya jayega, lekin uske baad bina notice die dukaanon ko sil karne kii karrwai shuru kar di jaaegi
 So the same market association said that people will talk to MCD leaders about this issue, how can they take conversion charge in the special area area

 Let me tell you that Disha married Mumbai Chartered Accountant Mayur Padiya in the year 2015
 unhone pichley saal november main ek beti ko janm diya tha
 Striking students of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) surrounded the institute's director Prashant Pathrabe in his office on Monday evening
 in chaatro ko teetar-bitar karne ke liye parisar main police bulani padi
 These FTII students were protesting against the 'unfair' assessment of the incomplete diploma project
 kareeb 40 chaatro ne patharabe kaa gheraav kiya, jisase vahaan tanaav fail gaya or chaatr vahaan se tab tak nahin hate jab tak ki unhone 2008 batch kii adhuri film pariyojna ke jari akalan par 'uchit' jawaab nahin diya
 The comments isse pehle somvaar shaam patharabe ne kaha tha ki chaatro ne unka gheraav kiya, lekin vah 'surakshit' hai
 a representative of the students said that he had 'stopped' the director in his office, as he had 'decided to continue inappropriate assessment of film projects'
 apatiai chaatr sanghathan ne aarope lagaaya he ki akalan raajnneetik rup se prerit he or 2008 batch ke 50 chaatro se adhuri pariyojnaon ke kaaran 'zyada samay tak' parisar main rahane se chhutkaaraa paanaa he
 Pathrabe said that he is following the orders of the ministry regarding the assessment
 apatiai ke ye chaatr adhure diploma pariyojna ke 'anuchit' akalan ko lekar virodh jataa rahe the
 Around 40 students surrounded Pathrabe, causing tension there and the students did not leave until they gave a 'reasonable' answer to the ongoing assessment of the 2008 batch's incomplete film project
 tippaniyan Earlier Monday evening, Pathrabe had said that the students surrounded him, but he was 'safe'
 chaatro ke ek pratinidhi ne kaha ki unhone nideshak ko unke karyaalay main 'roak liya tha', kyonki unhone 'film pariyojnaon ke anuchit akalan ko jari rakhane kaa nirnay' kiya tha
 The FTII student organization has alleged that the assessment is politically motivated and has got rid of 50 students of the 2008 batch from staying on campus for 'much longer' due to incomplete projects
 patharabe ne kaha ki akalan ko lekar vah mantralay ke adeshon kaa paalan kar rahe hai

 rabi kii fasal par bemausam barsaat kii maar ke bich jab 22 april ko bhartiya mausam vigyaan vibhaag ne monsoon purvanumaan main saamaanya se kam yani 93 fisadi barish kii baat kahi, to kisaan se lekar desh ke pradhan tak, sabko dhakka laga
 Especially when private sector company Skymet had forecast a slightly higher than normal rainfall of 102 per cent in the monsoon on April 6, a fortnight ago
 faasla tab or bad gaya jab 2 june ko mausam vibhaag ne yahi anumaan ghataakar 88 fisadi kar diya
 It is common for the two agencies to have slight differences in weather forecasting, but such a large difference in the forecasts of Skymet and the Meteorological Department presenting their forecasts before the Meteorological Department was enough for an interesting debate
 sabase pehle donon agenciyon kii takat ke bare main jaan lenaa jaruri he
 The Meteorological Department has a network of meteorological stations spread across the country as well as satellite and other facilities
 sarkari agency duniya ke 192 deshon, sanyukt raashtra or viksit deshon kii mausam agenciyon ke saath data saajha karti he
 Research continues between scientists and other departments of the Ministry of Earth Sciences, besides the Meteorological Department which has more than 400 posts of scientists
 desh ke sabase behtareen super computer bhi sarkaar ne mausam ke liye rakh chode hai
 Laxman Singh Rathore, director general of the Indian Meteorological Department, says, "you should understand that India is second to none in the world in terms of weather forecast
 balki kai maamalon main hamane america agenciyon se behatar purvanumaan vyakt kiye hai
 On the other hand, Skymet has a small, but agile army
 purvanumaan vyakt karne vaali isaki team main 25 ke kareeb vaigyanik hai
 The weather forecast here was commanded by Air Vice Marshal (retd) G, the head of the Meteorological Department of the Air Force
 pi
 Sharma handles
 sharma bhi maanate hai ki mausam vibhaag kii tulana main company kaa buniyadi dhaancha bahut chota he
 They also do not have as fast supercomputers
 desh bhar main unke paas 2,500 se adhik observetary hai, lekin monsoon kaa purvanumaan jataane main inaki upyogita simit he
 For the monsoon forecast, Skymet takes data from global agencies and purchases satellite images as per requirements
 is sabake baavjood sharma kehete hai, ''mausam kaa purvanumaan computer kii kshamta or data jenereshan ke alaava lambey anubhav or behatar work culture kii darkaar rakhata he
 We beat the rest of the people here
 ''yahi nahin, mausam vibhaag ke paas jahaan sarkari fund he, vahiin scymet kaa astitv munaafe or zyada se zyada client kii sankhya par tikaa he
 The Skymet website, which collects more than 1 million pageviews daily, is designed in such a way that people get interesting information about the weather here
 company ke paas marketing kii behatar ranneeti to he hi
 These trends play an important role in deciding the form of forecasting for both agencies
 apane purvanumaanon main 4 fisadi kii ghat-bad kii gunjaaish maanakar chalane vaali donon agenciyon ke purvanumaan 2013 or 2014 main ek duusare se bahut alag nahin the
 But this time when the Meteorological Department came up with forecast of 88 percent rainfall in June, it also said that it will receive 92 percent rainfall in July and 90 percent in August
 june ke bare main mausam vibhaag ne alag se koi purvanumaan nahin jataayaa or sitambar kaa purvanumaan vah agast ke pehle hafte main batayega
 That is, the department is blistering
 iske ulat scymet ne jokhim lete hue may main jari purvanumaan main kaha ki june main 107 fisadi, july main 104 fisadi, agast main 99 fisadi or sitambar main 96 fisadi barish hogi
 But in the first two months, his forecasts missed the target
 june main 107 fisadi kii jagah 116 fisadi barish hui, vahiin july main 23 taarikh tak saamaanya se 24 fisadi kam barish hui he
 That is, his forecast for July is far from the target
 aise main agar kahin agast or sitambar ke uske purvanumaan sateek baithe to 102 fisadi ausat barish kii bhavishyavaanee khatre main pad jaaegi
 But rejecting this arithmetic, Jatin Singh, CEO of Skymet, says, "july is not over yet
" thodaa intjaar kariye
 We stand at 102 percent rainfall forecast
 '' saath hi ve kehete hai ki july ke purvanumaan main 16 fisadi ghat-bad kii model gunjaaish rahati he or hamaara anumaan puure monsoon ke liye he
 Maybe, his argument is correct
 lekin sawaal uthanaa lajimi he ki jab har maheene ke purvanumaan main itani badi model erar kii gunjaaish he to company ne har maheene kaa purvanumaan dene kaa jokhim uthaaya hi kyon? or har maheene kaa ausat bigadgaye ke baad chaaron maheenon kaa ausat sahi bhi baith jaae to use tir kahenge yaa tukka?vaise, purvanumaanon se itar june main atirikt barish kaa matlab he—behatar kheti
 Says Rathore, "from June 1 to July 23, the country has received 7 per cent less rainfall, but the extra rain in June was at the time of crop sowing, so it is good for the farmer
 '' vahiin, mathura ke krishi visheshgy dilip kumaar yadav kehete hai, ''kisaan ko varsha kaa aankada nahin, sahi samay par varsha chahie
 "that is, if the macro economy is meant by an average of four months of rainfall, then agriculture is meant by the timing of rainfall
" bhavishyavaanee ke is aakraamak daur main neshnal centre for medium range wedar forcasting, noida ke ek varisht mausam vigyaani dakshin korea ke jojo island main beete 22 june ko hui valrd miteorological orgenigeshan kii mahatvapurn baithak kii yaad dilaate hai
 In this meeting, scientists admitted that even the best-known coupled dynamic model available in the whole world has failed to predict the monsoon very accurately
 ve kehete hai, ''vahaan vaigyanikon ne mana ki aap monsoon ko saamaanya yaa kam-zyada kah sakate hai, lekin fisadi main sateek bhavishyavaaniyan karnaa abhi sambhav nahin he
 "in such a situation, the agencies predicting the monsoon will have to think that the big predictions should not create a crisis on their credibility

 ' ek baar phir gujarat chunaav bijepi ke paksh main rahaa
 Before the election, there were speculations that this time the path of victory is difficult for BJP
 vahiin, chunaav ke nateezon ne in tamaam kayaason par pani pher diya
 This election once again proved that the magic of Modi in Gujarat is still intact
 haalanki, sangharsh se nikle netaa hardik, alpesh or jignesh ne rahul gandhi ke saath milakar modi ke magic ko khatm karne kaa khub prayaas kiya, lekin nateezon main iskaa asar dikhataa najar nahin aa rahaa
 Alpesh and Jignesh themselves won the election, but could not get the seats of the Congress to the way it was thought during the election
 padhein ladke to jeet gaye lekin BJP kii gaddi nahin hilaa paae
 
 
 Quartet before the election The quartet of Hardik Patel, Alpesh Thakur, Jignesh Mevani and Rahul was prepared before the election
 jisnegujarat chunaav prachaar main modior bijepi par jamkar waar kiya
 An atmosphere was created by these leaders that the people of Gujarat are deeply troubled by the BJP
 saath hi gujarat kaa jo model desh main dikhaaya gaya he, wo jhootha he
 During the campaigning, the crowd was also seen in the rallies of these leaders, but this crowd could not be converted into votes and the BJP crossed the victory figure in Gujarat
 aakhir main jhonki takatchunaav ke aakhir main hardik patel, alpesh thakur, jignesh mewaani or rahul kii ore se puri takat jhonk di gai
 Many of these leaders also launched personal attacks on Modi
 vahiin, rahul kii ore se modi se rojaanaa sawaal bhi puche ja rahe the
 Not only this, Rahul and Hardik had also prepared a formula to give reservation to Patel caste
 in tamaam baton ke baad bhi modi kaa gujarat main asar kam nahin hua
 Modi too faced these leaders firmly and was seen to backfire every attack
 alpesh-jignesh kii jeetchunaav se pehle tamaam raajnneetik panditon ko aisa abhas ho rahaa tha ki ye hardik patel, alpesh thakur or jignesh mewaani kaa asar is chunaav main dekhne ko milegaa
 But when the results came out, it was the reverse
 alpesh or jignesh khud to chunaav jeet gaye, lekin congress ko siten dilaane main nakaamyaab rahe
 At the same time, Modi has once again led the BJP to victory in Gujarat
 palat nahin paae bajirahul gandhi ne bhi gujarat ke chunaav main jamkar mehnat kii
 Due to his hard work, discussions about his serious image also became common
 iske saath hi hardik patel ne bhi patidaar andolan se bijepi ko rajya main kadi takkar di
 At the same time, Jignesh and Alpesh also campaigned strongly against Bijpi
 lekin is sab ke baavjoodbijepiki gaddi gujarat main hill nahin pai or ab gujarat main bijepi kii sarkaar banane ja rahi he
