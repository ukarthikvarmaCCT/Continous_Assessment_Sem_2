 ’ In view of Delhi Assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said during a rally in Rohini on Tuesday that Delhi needs development and your dreams are my dreams
 mujhe aapkaa aashirwad chahie, yah kaam karne ke liye
 Experienced people should sit on the throne of Delhi, not novices
 congress par hamalaa karte hue modi ne kaha, is baar maa-bete ke prachaar ko bhi mediavaale tavajjo nahin de rahe hai
 Nobody is listening to his words
 modi ne vipakshi dalon par hamalaa kiya or kaha ki vipakshi ghisipity baaten kar rahe hai
 Who knows Modi outside Gujarat, who knows, but we found a lot of love in Delhi
 saaton kii saaton siten bijepi ke khate main gayi
 Delhi has made its way
 dilli ke pyaar kaa karj chukaane kaa jimmaa meraa
 i will repay Delhi's love loan with interest and development
 dilli ke vikaas kii baat isliye kar rahaa hum, kyonki dilli par saare vishwa kii najar rahati he
 The identity of Delhi itself identifies the whole of India
 dilli ko duniya kii tamaam rajdhaniyon ke hisaab se vikaas chahie
 Today, it is the responsibility of the country how the capital of the country should be
 iske liye meri bhi jimmedaari he
 Your dreams are my dreams ham milakar desh kii rajdhani ko nai oonchaaiyon par le jaaenge
 On the AAP party, Modi said that the Congress was an old party, it also had more power to destroy
 15 saal tak raaj kiya or phir tempreri aae
 Were small, had little power, then destroyed a year
 piem ne kaha ki hamaari jimmedaari he ki 16 saal kii galatiyon ko sudhaarna he
 Speaking on inflation, Modi said what was the cost of gas cylinders in the country in January 2014 and what is now
 ek saal pehle 1240 rupee tha, aaj 605 rupee main miltaa he
 It is natural to spread lies
 is desh main aisa varg he, jo pichley 60 saal se aisa kar rahaa he
 He said that many people had the opportunity to have fun without working
 ab unhen dikkat ho rahi he
 These people did not accept Sardar Patel, Lal Bahadur Shastri and Morarji Desai

 On the support of the Congress to AAP, Modi attacked the AAP party fiercely on the VIP issue and the donations issue
 modi ne kaha, kis bank main kiskaa khaataa he, unhen (arvind kejariwal) yah to unako maaloom he, lekin apane khate main kiskaa paisa he, yah vah nahin jaanate
 Modi said, countrymen do not tolerate cheating
 janata sab jaan rahi he
 He gave the example that former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Indira Gandhi also described themselves as clean and they were also accused of corruption
 unhen pareshaani isliye hui, kyonki unhone apane aapako saaf-suthra bataaya tha
 He (kejriwal) was also telling himself clearly, what happened now? modi ne kejariwal par hamalaa karte hue kaha, kya aise aadmi ke haath main dilli ko diya ja saktaa he
 Cleverness cannot hide for long
 saarvajanik jivan main agnipariksha deni padati he or ham log janata kaa vishwaas jitkar yahaan par pahunche hai
 Praising Modi, he said that in the last eight months we have done one after the other
 hamane i-rickshaw waalon kanoonee suraksha di
 The government is for the poor
 dilli ke gaanvon main vikaas kii baat karte hue modi ne kaha ki gaanv main garibon ko suvidhaayen milengi, sarkaar is ore kaam kar rahi he
 The government is working for schools, houses and roads for the poor and for such work the government will take land and land will not be taken for any wrong doing
 daliton, adivasee ke naam arabon-kharbon rupee sarkaar ke kharch hote hai, lekin vah paise kahaan jate hai yah pataa nahin chalata
 Therefore, all these help will go directly to the accounts under the Jan Dhan Yojana
 ham aise hi kaam karenge, jisase bhrashtachar apane aap samaapt ho or sabko unka haq mili
 This plan is the largest event in the world
 paanch karod logon ke khaaton main gas silendar kii sabsidi pahunch gai he or akele dilli main 22 lakh logon ke khate main sabsidi gai he or ek bhi shikaayat nahin ai
 Speaking on unauthorized colonies, the PM said that drinking water and electricity will be available in these colonies

 Describing the government's plan on slum dwellers, he said that these people will also be provided pucca houses
 jahaan par log pidiyon se rah rahe hai, vahiin ghar banegaa

 We are not only making promises in the field of electricity, we are working

 Third, roof tops are promoting electricity, ie solar energy
 piem ne kaha ki desh ke noujvaan ko rojgaar chahie or apane ghar ke paas chahie
 The young man will work when he gets a fair chance
 mek in india ke tahat kaarkaane badhaane kii taiyaari he, jisase yuvaaon ko rojgaar milegaa
 Modi said that we are also concerned about the village and poverty

 The case reached the sessions court and during the trial, the judge, Sessions Judge UB Hejib, said that Salman should face charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder
 salmaan ke khilaaf isse pehle laaparvaahee se maut (ipisi kii dhara 304 e) ke tahat halke aarope ke liye magistrate ne mukadmaa chalaaya tha
 There is a provision of maximum 2 years of imprisonment under him

 pichley bhaashan ko ek 'kharaab raat' qaraar dete hue obama ne republican party ke ummidavaar mit romany ke khilaaf chunaav jeetne kaa vishwaas jataayaa
 In an interview on TV for the first time since the presidential speech on October 3, Obama told ABC News, "it was a good night for Governor Romney, it was a bad night for me
" yah pehali baar nahin he
 There are a total of three presidential speeches for this post
 doosraa bhaashan aagaamee 16 oktober ko neuyork main hona he
 Insisting on fighting for his comeback, Obama said, "I think the most important thing is that the values of this race are not changed
" garvanar romany ne apni sthiti chhipaane ke liye kaaphi koshishen kii hai
 He said, it was a good ceremony
 hamaare paas chaar saptaah bache hai
 No other person is fighting harder than me
 unhen (romany) jarurat he ki ve agle saptaah mangalvaar ko bhi behatar pradarshan kar saken
 Obama said, if you have a poor performance, then you go ahead and focus on another opportunity, which further strengthens your intentions
 jab obama se poocha gaya ki kya is kharaab pradarshan kaa matlab chunaavon kaa romany ke paksh main hona he, to obama kaa jawaab tha, nahin
 At the same time, when asked about his victory in the November 6 elections, he said with confidence, yes
 tippaniyan Speaking to radio presenter Tom Joyner after the October 3 speech, Obama said, "I think i was very polite with Romney during the speech
" lekin kai baar lagaataar vah baat kahana mushkil hota he, jo vastav main sach na ho
 But the good news is that this was the first time
 garvanar romany ne ve sari baaten logon ke saamne rakh deen, jinamein yaa to vah apni jimmedaariyon se bhaagate hue yaa chikitsakeey suvidhaon main baari katautee karte hue dikh rahe hai
 These things will harm them in the long run
 apni jeet ke bare main aashwast obama ne kaha, agle saptaah tak bahut sa tanaav dur hoga, kyonki in chunaavon main ham aage chalane vaale hai or jeetne bhi vaale hai
 Calling the previous speech a 'bad night', Obama expressed confidence of winning the election against Republican candidate Mitt Romney
 3 oktober ko hue raashtrapati bhaashan ke baad pehali baar tivi par saakshaatkaar dete hue obama ne abisi news ko bataaya, garvanar romany ke liye vah acchhee raat thi, mere liye vah kharaab raat thi
 This is not the first time
 is pad ke liye kul teen raashtrapati bhaashan hone hai
 The second speech is to be held in New York on 16 October
 apni vaapasi ke liye ladane par jor dete hue obama ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki sabase khaas baat yah he ki is daud ke jo mulya hai, ve badale nahin hai
 Governor Romney has tried hard to hide his position
 unhone kaha, yah ek acha samaaroh tha
 We have four weeks left
 koi or vyakti mujhase zyada mehnat ke saath nahin lard rahaa 
 He (romney) needs to do even better on Tuesday next week
 obama ne kaha, agar aapkaa ek pradarshan kharaab rahata he, to aap aage badhate hai or duusare maukey par apana dhyaan lagaate hai, jo ki aapke iraadon ko or zyada majbootee detaa he
 When Obama was asked whether this poor performance meant elections were in favor of Romney, Obama's answer was no
 vahiin jab 6 november ke chunaavon main unki jeet ke bare main poocha gaya, to unhone puri yakeen ke saath kaha, haa
 The comments 3 oktober ke bhaashan ke baad radio par prastota tom joinar se baat karte hue obama ne bataaya, mujhe lagata he ki bhaashan ke dauraan main romany ke saath kuch zyada hi vinamr rahaa
 But sometimes it is difficult to say something which is not really true
 lekin isamen ek acchhee khabar yah he ki yah pehla hi mauka tha
 Governor Romney put all those things in front of people, either in which he is seen running away from his responsibilities or drastically cutting medical facilities
 ye chijen unhen dirghagami nuksaan pahunchaayengi
 Confident of his victory, Obama said, "by next week a lot of tension will go away, because in these elections we are going to go ahead and win
" is pad ke liye kul teen raashtrapati bhaashan hone hai

" shiksha mantri smriti irani ek baar phir soshal media ke nishane par hai

 ab koi or mantralay hota to phir bhi thik he lekin maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ke letters head par is tarah kii galati kaise pachaai ja sakati he
 In fact, 'resource' has been written as 'resource' on the letter head and 'minister' has been written as 'minster' in English

 This kinda attention seeking is so cheapa smile & politeness from a celebrity would make a world of difference
 i won’t mind a celebrity trying their part on improving our country, but the way she communicates & the harsh message Virat posts in social media is not the right way to make the difference

 On the occasion of Makar Sankranti, the Bihar Congress invited all parties of the Mahagathbandhan, including RJD, for a meal of Chuda curd
 congress karyaalay sadakat ashram main die gaye is bhoj main argedy netaa tejasvi yadav, rashtriya lok samta party adhyaksh upendra kushvaha samet vikasshil insaan party ke adhyaksh mukesh saahani pahunche
 However Hindustani Awam Morcha president Jeetan Ram Manjhi and Loktantrik Janata Dal president Sharad Yadav did not attend the event
 khaane kii teble par to mahagathbandhan ke sabhi netaaon ne bharpoor ekajutata dikhaane kii koshish kii
 But as soon as Tejashwi Yadav departed from the Sadaqat Ashram, Bihar Pradesh Congress President Madan Mohan Jha started showing eye to the coordination of seats in the grand alliance
 ajtak se baatcheet karte hue madan mohan jha ne kaha ki uttar pradesh main bahujan samaaj party or samaajawaadee party ne congress ko kam aankane kii galati kii he jiskaa khamiyaja use loksabhaa chunaav main bhugatna hi padegaa
 He said that when it comes to the coordination of seats in Bihar, only the Congress will not sacrifice
 unhone kaha ki mahagathbandhan main argedy ko bhi qurbaani deni padegi
 Let me tell you that on Monday, Tejashwi Yadav said that to defeat the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections, all parties of the Grand Alliance should be ready to sacrifice for seats
 haalanki tejasvi yadav ne ek baar phir se doharaaya ki congress bihar mahagathbandhan kaa majboot hissaa he
 In fact, before the announcement of seats in Bihar, both Congress and RJD are constantly trying to send each other a message that no party should mistake themselves as big brother in this grand alliance
 sutron ke mutabik bihar main mahagathbandhan main siton kaa elaan jald ho saktaa he
 The seat sharing formula has been prepared here
 iske mutabik argedy 18-20 seat, congress 8 -12, araspi 4-5, hindustani awam morcha or loktantric janata dal ko 1-2 seat mil sakati he
 It is believed that Jeetan Ram Manjhi is demanding 3 seats for his party, but his demand does not seem to be fulfilled
 lihaaja vah naaraaz hai
 For this reason, he kept himself away from the Congress' Chuda Dahi Treat
 vahiin 4
 Upendra Kushwaha, who was part of the NDA for 5 years, after attending the Chuda Dahi program of the Congress, said that he has been receiving invitations from the NDA leaders to participate in the Chuda Dahi program in the last 4 years, but he never did such programs i did not go indian premier lig main spot phixing or sattebaaji ko lekar khulaason kaa daur jari he
 Gurunath Meiyappan, arrested by the Mumbai Police, has revealed that he betted on 9 matches in which he lost 1 crore
 police sutron ke mutabik poochtacha ke dauraan gurunath ne satta lagane kii baat maani
 Gurunath said that out of these 9 matches, he has benefited 4 times, while he has suffered 5 times
 mayppan ne daawa kiya ki usne sattebaaji vindu daara singh ke kehane par shuru kii
 During the inquiry, the son-in-law of the BCCI president told that in the initial days he used to bet Rs 5-10 lakh
 shuruyaat main use jeet mili par baad main use nuksaan bhi hua
 To make up for this loss, later Meiyappan started investing more money in betting
 use aisa karne ke liye vindu daara singh ne kaha tha
 Gurunath has also admitted that he lost Rs 1 crore in betting
 garunath mayppan par aaajeevan pratibandhisase pehle, vivaadon main ghiri bisisiai ne chennai superkings ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari gurunath mayppan ko ipel spot phixing prakaran main unki bhoomika par lambit jaanch tak nilambit kar diya

 Who is Gurunath Meiyappan? 35 year old Meiyappan is from Chennai
 shrinivasana kii beti roopa se unhone prem vivaah kiya tha
 Srinivasan opposed interracial marriage
 bataaya jaataa he ki mayppan ko padhai ke dauraan skool se nikaal diya gaya tha
 Meiyappan is considered very superstitious
 ve golf ke shaukeen hai
 Apart from this, Gurunath Meiyappan owns 9 million yachts
 ve real estate kaa bhi kaam karte hai
 BCCI President n Srinivasan adamant on not resigning; BCCI President n Srinivasan arrived in Kolkata from Chennai via Mumbai three days later and made it clear that he was not going to leave the post
 shrinivasana ne kaha ki na to unhone or na hi unki team chennai superkings ne kuch galat kiya he, aise main pad chhodane kaa sawaal nahin

 The next time it was Vohra's turn on the googly, who did not even know when the ball came out from between his bat and pad and uprooted the leg stump

 com / datbwlnoxs The search engine Google has created and paid tribute to German glass chemist Marga Fallstich on the 103rd birth anniversary of her
 vah vaishvik glass vinirmaan company 'shot agi' kii pehali mahila kaaryakari adhikari thim
 It is the largest manufacturing company in optical and technical specialty glasses in Europe
 jaane- marga ke jivan se judi kai baaten
 
 
 - Marga was born on 16 June 1915
 unhone 'shot agi' ke saath 44 saal tak kaam kiya
 Fallastic started his career as a graduate assistant in a company making optical fibers
 - reports ke anusaar graduate assistant se kariyar kii shuruyaat karne ke baad vah pehle technician baniin or uske baad scientific assistant or vaigyanik baniin
 This is the world's smallest country, know- USP- During this time, Marga worked on more than 300 different types of optical glass, out of which 40 are patented in his name
 - bataa den ki unhone melting pot bhi banaaya tha, jo kaaphi ucch taapmaana par bhi nahin pighalta
 - Marga Fallstich received international recognition for the invention of the lightweight lens 'SF64', for which she was also honored in 1973
 ye he rahasyamayi registan, jaane- yahaan kyon apane aap khiskate hai pathar- ritred hone ke baad unhone kai glass sammelnon main vyaakhyaan die or yatraaen kii
 - He died in 1998 at the age of 82 in Mainz
 nadisutra / manjit thakuryah nadi kabhi bengal kaa shok kahi jaati thi
 Bottomless watershed, and even more rougher forms

 Yes, it is the Damodar River
 par damodar kaa saubhaahgya kahie yaa durbhaagya, uski baadh par ankush lagane ke liye aazaadee ke baad damodar ghati pariyojna (divisi) shuru hui
 The flood was well controlled, but the real eye was on the iron and coal present in its basin
 anginat udyog lage or aaj kii taarikh main dantakthaon main maujuud damodar nadi desh kii adhik pradooshit nadiyon kii fehrist main shaamil he
 There are 10 thermal power stations along the banks of the Damodar River, which produce some 2
4 million metric tons of ash annually
 in bijligharon main 65
 7 lakh metric tonnes of coal is consumed annually and this produces 8,768 MW of electricity
 damodar nadi ko pradooshit karne kaa khel ranchi jile ke kol belt khelaari main shuru hota he
 Then as soon as it enters Ramgarh district, Patratu Thermal Power Station and Central Coalfield Limited coal washeries pollute this river even more
 kol washari se nikle malbe kii maatra 30 lakh ton salanaa hoti he
 On entering Bokaro district, these three power plants used to directly dump coal ash in Damodar
 dhanbad main is nadi kii sthiti itani kharaab ho gai ki udyog jagat ke tamaam dawaabon ke baavjood paryaavaran mantralay ne dhanbad main nae udyogon ko manjuuri dene se manaa kar diya tha
 The Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board (JSPCB) website lists the names of 94 waste-reducing industries in Damodar, mostly thermal power houses and coal washeries
 san 2004 main damodar bachaao andolan kii shuruyaat karne vaale netaa or jharkhand sarkaar main mantri sarayu raay kaa maananaa he ki yah haalat to tab he jab damodar ke pradooshan str main kaaphi sudhaar hua he
 But the Tenughat Thermal Power Plant, a unit of the state government, still keeps the coal ash secretly on the banks of the river because its ash pond is no longer of any use
 pichley saal disambar (2017) main sipisibi ne tenughat sanyantr ko band karne kaa nirdesh diya tha kyonki yah damodar nadi ko gambhir nuksaan pahunchaa rahaa tha
 Yet the situation has become such that people around Bokaro do not even go to celebrate Chhath in Damodar
 damodar kaa pattharon se athkheliyaan karata pani kaale or gandale sadan bhare bahaav main tabdeel ho gaya he
 However, JSPCB member secretary Rajeev Lochan Bakshi claims that pollution control laws are enforced much more stringently than before and these monitoring units continue to be monitored continuously
 par iskaa asar nadi kii sehat par padataa dikhaa nahin he
 In 2011, the Zoological Survey of India conducted a survey on the sunrise of the Damodar river, in which the details of the bad condition of this river due to thermal power stations are available
 damodar ghati ke bijligharon se hawa main gas ke rup main ja rahi gandhak barish ke saath tejaab ban jaati he or nadi main mil jaati he
 According to csme's nearly two-decade-old report, the sulfur content exceeds 65,000 tonnes annually
 damodar nadi ghati ke daayre main aane vaale jharkhand ke nau jile hai or iske kinare kai shahar based hue hai
 Many environmentalists even call Damodar as organic desert and black desert
 kabhi bharat sarkaar ne bahuddeshy damodar pariyojna ke elaan ke saath logon ko vikaas kaa sabjbag dikhaaya tha
 The situation at the moment is that the water of Damodar is not available for drinking
 pani chhodie, yah itnaa adhik pradooshit he ki log nahaane se bhi kataraate hai
 There are large coal washeries on both sides of this river in Hazaribagh, Bokaro and Dhanbad districts, which divert thousands of cubic liters of coal into the Dhowan river every day
 in kolvashariyon main giddi, tandva, swang, kathara, dugada, barora, munidih, lodana, jamaroba, patharadih, sudamdih or chasanala shaamil hai
 Along with this, there are big coal kilns in this area which continuously pollute the river
 chandrapura taap bijlighar main rojaanaa 12 hajaar metric ton koyale kii khapat hoti he or usase har roj nikalne vaala raakh damodar main bahaya jaataa he
 Consequently, the value of solids in the Damodar river water is much higher than the average
 damodar nadi ke pani main baari dhaatu, loha, maiganej, tamba, lead, nikal vagairah maujuud hai, pehle yahaan ke logon main manyata thi ki damodar nadi main nahaane se twachaa rog dur ho jate hai
 But today the situation is that if you dare plunge into Damodar, then skin disease is sure to happen
 damodar nadi main pradooshan kaa asar yahaan ke logon kii aajeevika par bhi padaa he
 Till a few decades ago, there were many species of fish in this river
 par ab jahrile pani main machhlee chhodie kisi bhi kism kaa jaleey jivan naammumkin he
 The soil of the fields adjacent to the banks of Damodar river has become poisonous and experts say that the yield in the fields in this area has been reduced by fifty percent
 damodar nadi ke dam par is nadighati main maujuud taap bijlighar hi nahin, kai saare steel plant bhi chalate hai
 Damodar gets use of many industries and drinking water of cities
 jab damodar nadi hi mar jaaegi to kya iske naam par chalane vaale bahuddeshy nadi ghati pariyojna kaa uddeshy aakhirkaar sadh jayega yaa phir vah niruddeshy rah jayega?sawaal dushwaar jarur he par jawaab jaananaa bhi utana hi jaruri he
 After all, who is connected to the future

 With the 'ghar Ghar Congress' campaign, the Grand Old Party is trying hard to connect emotionally with the people in the Gujarat elections
 koshish yahi he ki party upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne gujarat ke tabadatod prachaar dauron se jo maahaul banaaya he, uski dhamak puure chunaav prachaar ke dauraan sunai detii rahe
 The Congress is throwing a lot of thoughtfully at the election election of Chausar, it is a proof that Rahul could not be seen from the line of 'soft Hindutva' anywhere during the Gujarat elections
 congress gujarat main apni khoi jameen ko dobaaraa hasil karne ke liye jahaan haath-pair maar rahi he vahiin party se baahar ke yuva turkon ke jariye bijepi ko gherne main bhi koi kasar nahin chhod rahi
 But at the same time, full care is also being taken that no Congress slogan or jumle should be given a chance to make BJP an issue
 congress ko 2007 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav kaa kadava anubhav abhi tak yaad he
 Then the words 'death dealer' from Sonia Gandhi were redeemed by the then Chief Minister Narendra Modi and BJP in such an election that the Congress was all around
 gujarat chunaav prachaar main is baar shuru main 'vikaas gando thayo che' (vikaas pagal ho gaya he) kii kaaphi gunj sunai di
 But by adding all the political profit and loss of such words, the Congress and Rahul realized their goodness in avoiding it in the campaign
 gujarat kii siyaasi ladaai 'modi banaam rahul' kii tarah pregent naa kii jaae iske liye congress phoonk-phoonk kar kadam uthaa rahi he
 Rahul himself has instructed party leaders to refrain from personal and sharp comments on Prime Minister Modi
 rahul gujarat kii siyaasi jang ko 'bijepi banaam gujarat kii janata' kaa naam de rahe hai, saath hi kah rahe hai congress janata ke saath he
 Rahul has kept trade and jobs at the center of speech in Gujarat
 yahi vajah he ki wo modi sarkaar ke notebandi or jiesti lagu karne ke faislon par hi sabase zyada prahaar karte rahe hai
 While listening to 'jai Sardar' and 'jai Bhavani' in Rahul's slogans, it may be surprising, but Rahul seems to do so in political terms
 rahul gandhimodi sarkaar ke khilaaf '5-10 udyogpatiyon ko phayda or sab pareshaan' kaa naaraa dekar vot bank par nishaanaa sadhate najar aae
 Now is this the strategy or something else, but this time Rahul was seen trying to meet people more in the election campaign
 bacchon ke saath selfi ho yaa unhen toffiyaan baantnaa, adivaasiyon ke bich jaakar unke saath photo khinchvaana, ye sab kuch rahul ke nae andaaj kii baangi rahaa
 Rahul's direct communication with the people during election tours, question and answer are all the things that gave a new edge to Rahul's speeches
 rahul raat ko saamaanya gujarati dhabon or restaurant main gujarati khaanaa khate dikhe to subah ko gujarati chaay, khakhdaa, fafada kaa naashtaa karte bhi najar aae
 Taking a lesson from how much BJP had won in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections on social media, the Congress is leaving no stone unturned in campaigning through Twitter and Facebook in this election
 rahul logon se ye kehete bhi najar aate hai ki bijepi ne khaastaur par unki chhavi kharaab karne ke liye hi 200 logon kososhal mediaper tainaat kar rakhaa he
 How confident is the Congress about its victory in the Gujarat elections, this shows that in the internal survey, the party is not tired of claiming itself to have won 120 seats in Gujarat
 congress patidaar netaa hardik patel, obisi netaa alpesh thakor or dalit netaa jignesh mewaani ke apane saath aane ko bhi badi kamyaabi kii tarah pesh kar rahi he
 The Congress is working on the strategy that these young trio come forward to openly campaign for the party so that their communities' anger on the BJP can be redeemed
 in samudaayon ke alaava congress adivasee voton ko saadhane ke liye bhi puraa jor lagaae hue he
 The Congress is trying to cross the electoral mile through Rahul's 'soft Hindutva card' and PODA (patidar, OBC, Dalit, Adivasi)
 sutron ke mutabik congress 16 november ko gujarat ke pehle charan kii 89 siton ke lieummidavaaronki suchi kaa elaan karegi
 Sources reveal that in the first meeting of the Congress Central Election Committee, the names of only 3 Muslim candidates for 89 seats were discussed
 sutara bataate hai ki pehle charan ke liye sabase adhik patidaar samudaay (patel) ko 21 seat dene kaa prastaav he
 In the last election, out of so many seats, Congress had fielded Patel candidates for only 14
 iske alaava congress 89 siton main se 16 adivasee ummidavaar, 5 essi ummidavaar, 9 coli samudaay ummidavaar or 12 obisi-thakor ummidavaar utaarne kaa man bana rahi he
 The Congress may try to wager on Kshatriya candidates in 5 seats
 pehali list main 8 mahila ummidavaaron, youth congress or NSUI se yuva ummidavaaron ko congress kaa tikat mil saktaa he
 According to sources, 49 of the 89 candidates will be in the age group of 35 to 50 years

 com / uxszxvmhol Jnanpith Award-awarded playwright and actor Girish Karnad said that 18th century Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan would have been given the same status as Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji if he had not been a Hindu
 karnad ne ek anya vivaadit bayaan main kaha ki 'uchit' hota agar devanhalli main bengaluru antarrashtriya hawaii adde kaa naam kempegauda ke badale tipu sultan ke naam par hota
 Kempegowda was a vassal under the Vijayanagara Empire, who founded Bengaluru in 1537
 karnad ne kaha, 'main mahasoos karata hum ki agar tipu sultan muslim nahin hindu hote to unhen karnataka main vahi darja miltaa jo maharashtra main shivaji maharaj ko praapt he
 He said that Tipu did not get this honor due to his religious faith
 'kyonki aaj yah ho rahaa he ki hamaare vidwaan or netaa kisi kaa dharm or jati pehle dekhte hai
 
 
 He said, 'an injustice has been done to Tipu Sultan because of this type of evaluation
 
 
 ' This remark by the famous Kannada playwright and actor has come at a time when the state government has organized celebrations on the birth anniversary of Tipu Sultan

 He said that it would be more appropriate to name the airport after Tipu Sultan, as Devanhalli was his birthplace
 karnad ne kaha, 'main is baat se avgat hum ki main jo kah rahaa hum, us par bahes hogi

 Karnad said, 'I feel that if Tipu Sultan were not a Hindu, he would have got the same status in Karnataka as Shivaji Maharaj enjoys in Maharashtra
 ' unhone kaha ki tipu ko unki dharmik aasthaa ke kaaran yah sammaan nahin mila

 Governor shows that the Aam Aadmi Party is being treated with a view to discrimination"
 ye bahut dukh kii baat he, jisaki sarkaar he,or 67 vidhayak hai, lekin party daftar nahin he
 Aam Aadmi has fallen behind the party, why the distinction with 'AAP'? Kejriwal said that this is the first sentence after independence
 jis congress ke paas ek bhi vidhayak nahin hai unke paas 5 offis he
 At the same time, BJP has got 3 seats in Delhi, but BJP has 11 more offices with Ashok Road headquarters including BHP, RSS offices

 Kejriwal said, what is our fault? Our fault is that the country's largest tanker mafia is abolished
 jab se house tex maaf karne kii baat kii he usase bajepi baukhala gai he
 Now our office is taken away
 aam aadmi party janata ke haq ke liye, antim saans tak ladate rahenge
 Kejriwal also said that, the condition of the municipal schools and hospitals is not good, after the aap's victory in the MCD election will do it like the schools and hospitals of the Delhi government
 darasal sachai yah he ki ye log hamen khatm karnaa chaahate hai
 This party of the common man of the country wants to end that party, wants to suppress the voice of the common man but it will not happen, we are walking on the path of truth and God is with us
 hamane koi galat kaam nahin kiya
 We are fighting for the masses
 or aaj main dilli kii janata ko ye aashwaasan dena chahta hum ki chaahe ye log hamase sabakuch chin len, chaahe hamaara ofis chin len, ham log sadak par baithkar kaam kar lenge lekin janata ke haq ke liye ham yun hi ladate rahenge
 Will keep fighting for this country till his last breath
 antim saans tak in maffiaon se ladate rahenge janata ko haq dilaane ke liye
 And i am sure that the public is watching all this and in the MCD election on April 23, the people of Delhi will respond with their votes and teach them a lesson

 On Wednesday, the RBI has increased the repo rate

 After this increase, the repo rate increased from 6 per cent to 6
 25%
 Has become a percentage
 modi sarkaar ke 4 saal ke kaarykaal main yah pehali baar he, jab bhartiya rigerv bank ne repo rate main badhotaree kii he
 After the increase in interest rates from the Reserve Bank of India, it may become expensive for the common man to take loans from banks
 iske saath hi iemai par byaaj kaa boj dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 With this, the Monetary Policy Committee made CPI inflation 4 in the first half of FY 2018-19
 8 se 4
 Is expected to remain between 9
 vahiin, duusari chamahi main iske liye 4
 It is estimated to be 7 percent
 repo rate ke saath hi bhartiya rigerv bank ne reverse repo rate ko 6 fisadi kar diya gaya he
 All members of the Monetary Policy Committee voted in favor of raising the repo rate
 isse pehle royatres pole ne sambhaavna jataai thi ki bhartiya rigerv bank is baar bhi repo rate main katautee nahin karegaa
 The poll said the RBI may postpone it for August
 is pole main 56 arthshaastri shaamil hue the
 Of these, 26 had expected that the RBI would increase the repo rate this time
 haalanki anya isaki sambhaavna se inkaar kiya tha
 The RBI had not made any changes in interest rates before December and also in October
 darasal is dauraan mahangaai kii vajah se yah faisla liya gaya tha
 At this time the repo rate was kept at 6 percent only
 repo rate kya he?repo rate vah dar hoti he, jis par bank arabiai se lone uthaate hai
 In fact, whenever banks are short of funds, they take money from the central bank to make up for it
 arabiai kii taraf se diya jane vaala yah lone ek phixd rate par miltaa he
 This rate is called repo rate
 ise hameshaa bhartiya rigerv bank hi tay karata he
 Why does the RBI raise the repo rate? The Reserve Bank of India decides to cut or increase the repo rate based on the likely situation of the economy in the current and future
 kendriya bank repo rate main badhotaree zyaadaatar samay par tab karata he, jab desh main mahangaai kaa dabaav bana rahata he
 In such a situation, repo rate becomes an important means to bring it under control
 arabiai kii taraf se repo rate main badhotaree kiye jane se mahangaai ko kaabo rakhane main madad milti he
 Whenever RBI increases the repo rate, banks take less loan than that
 aisa hone kii vajah se chalan main mani supplai kam hoti he
 This helps in controlling inflation
 aap par hota he ye asarrepo rate badhane kaa matlab he ki bank arabiai se jo fund lenge, unhen vah mahangi daron par milegaa
 This increases the pressure on banks
 apane boj ko kam karne ke liye bank ise graahakon tak pahunchaate hai
 This burden is shared with you in the form of expensive debt and increased EMI
 isi vajah se jab bhi repo rate badhata he, to aapke liye karj lenaa mahangaa ho jaataa he
 Explain that the Reserve Bank of India did not make any change in interest rates even in February
 is dauraan visheshgy pehle hi isaki sambhaavn jataa chuke the
 In February, the impact of rising crude oil prices and the announcements made in the budget on the economy were reflected in the RBI decision
 isaki vajah se hi tay mana ja rahaa tha daren nahin ghatengi
 The repo rate was reduced in August, before this, in August last year, the RBI cut the repo rate
 is dauraan arabiai ne repa rate 0
 25 per cent
 is katautee ke baad hi repo rate 6 fisadi ho gaya tha

 Meanwhile, a video of police interrogation has also surfaced through social media in which Sister is confessing her crime
 iske vipareet mishanri ke bishap is maamle main sistar kaa haath hone se inkaar kar rahe the

 Earlier on Thursday, Indian Bishops Conference General Secretary Bishop Theodore Mascarenhas claimed here that Mother Teresa's 'missionaries of Charity' is not involved in the racket recently exposed for the purchase and sale of children and if one of the sisters is Even if convicted in the case, the entire missionary should not be maligned for his mistake

 By the way, Sister Concilia, who was arrested in this case, also told his lawyer that he is not involved in selling the children from anywhere

 Denying the Bishop's claims, Ranchi Senior Superintendent of Police Anish Gupta had already said, "the statement made by the Bishop of Theodore Mascarenhas, the General Secretary of the Indian Bishops Conference, is completely false and baseless
" police ne bacchon ko beche jane ke maamle main mishanri aaf charities kii sistar concilia ko giraftaar karne ke baad uske bayaan or usase mili soochnaaon ke aadhaar par hi chaar bacchon main se teen ko vibhinn sthanon se chaape markar hasil kiya he or bachaaya he

 co / kodnb1wght India has the largest youth population in the world
 is desh main kareeb 30
 56 crore youths live but perhaps only a few of them know that their name is 12 August
 yuvaaon se jude muddon kogambhirtha se saamne laane ke liye united neshans ne har saal 12 agast ko antarrashtriya yuva diwas manaane kaa elaan kiya
 On this day, many social and youth organizations organize workshops and separate events
 bhartiya ganatantr apni aazaadee ke 69wein saal main he
 Let us see what issues the Indian youth want independence
 
 
 1
 Freedom from gender discrimination - This is the freedom for which every girl starts fighting as soon as she is born
 ghar main zyada tavajjo na milane se lekar apni marji ke kapade na pahan paane tak, ladakiyon ko kai sari mushkilen jhelni padati hai
 Even in marriage, their choice is not taken care of
 (film 'corporate' ke ek seen main bipasha basu)2
 Tughlaqi decrees of panchayats like Khap are obstructed by the desire of the youth in many parts of independence from honor killing
 khaas taur par haryana main khap kaa asar zyada he
 Where people at some point kill daughters in the name of self-respect
 kai maamalon main ladke ladki donon kii hatya kar di kai
 Homosexuality, love marriage, choosing a boy of their own free will, all these things are considered against the rules of Khap, from which freedom is necessary
 yahi nahin, police bhi aise kaamon main tughluqi farmaan sunaati he
 Recently in Mumbai, the police arrested the couples from hotel rooms while they were at their own will
 (film 'dostana' kaa ek seen)3
 Forced Careers Most of the youth of the country are struggling with this difficulty
 18 saal kii umr tak pahunchate hi un par kariyar ko lekar sawaalon kii jhadi laga di jaati he or aakhir main un par jabaran kuch bhi thope diya jaataa he
 Most parents force a child to become an engineer or a doctor without asking their wish
 (film '3 edinuts' kaa ek seen)4
 Freedom to keep your perspective: Everyone should have the freedom to take their own view due to being in a democracy, but India is a country where it can become a problem for you to keep your point
 soshal media ne is war ko or badhaayaa he
 If you present your viewpoint apart from the crowd, then you become a victim of some political party or its supporters
 (film 'rang de basanti' kii ek tasviir)5
 Due to safety concerns, independent parents want to see their child safe, but they ignore that children cannot be kept safe by imprisoning them in the walls of the house
 khaskar ladakiyon ke maamle main parijan zyada sakht hote hai
 They are more concerned about the time they leave their homes and return home because they fear persecution like sexual harassment, kidnapping or murder

 ) captain viraat kohli or anil kumble ke bich hue vivaad main viraat kohli kii jeet hui
 Anil Kumble resigned from the post of coach, and after which questions were raised on Virat Kohli
 kai purv khilaadiyon ne bhi team par sawaal uthaae hai
 Meanwhile, the BCCI has said that we confess that we failed to reconcile the two
 lekin is sabhi ke bich ek baat jo chubhti he, vah ye ki bisisiai ek captain kii jid ke aage jhuk gaya
 BCCI remained silent! Actually, captain Virat Kohli was constantly in opposition to Anil Kumble
 unhone sachin tendulkar, vivies lakshmana or saurav ganguli kii salaahkaar samiti se bhi is bare main kah diya tha
 After which the controversy increased
 lekin bisisiai ek mook darshak bana rahaa
 Captain Virat Kohli was given so much power that the coach was removed due to his opposition
 is vivaad main coach anil kumble kaa paksh kaaphi kamjor pad gaya tha
 The veteran of which work? The BCCI had given the advisory committee of sachin-sourav-laxman full responsibility for choosing the coach, and he was completely free to decide on the coach position
 sabhi kavayadon ke baavjood bhi is samiti ne anil kumble ke kaarykaal ko badhaane kii baat kii thi, or westeindies daure tak unka kaarykaal badha bhi diya gaya tha
 But even then, this committee did not do one thing, Virat Kohli was under so much pressure that Kumble had to resign his post
 
 
 
 With this team, Virat Kohli? Guha, who was winning the World Cup, also raised the question on the superstar culture
 You will remember when the coach and captain's controversy had just started when Ramchandra Guha resigned from the BCCI Administrator Committee
 apane istife main unhone saaf taur kaha tha ki team main lagaataar superstar culture bad rahaa he, jiske kaaran hi yah vivaad hua he
 The captain should not have so much veto power that he can decide on the coach
 kumble se kyon bigadi baat? meeting kaa faisla nahin maanakar final main kohli ne lee thi gendbaazilgataar hua diggajon kaa apmaan!viraat kohli ke coach anil kumble ke vivaad ke bich kai purv khilaadiyon ne ise diggaj kaa apmaan bataaya
 At the same time, the committee of veterans like sachin-saurav-laxman was not accepted
 isse pehle bhi is samiti ke saath vivaad hua tha, jab ravi shastri kaa coach pad ke liye intervyuu hona tha
 But Shastri did not reach for the interview, after which he had a heated argument with Sourav Ganguly
 PAK se haar or kumble ke istife se dukhi ek fain kaa khulaa khat- viraat bhai, aap to aise na the Akshay Kumar's film 'padman' has got good reviews from the critics, but the film is now stuck in legal trouble

 He further wrote- The trailer of Padman was released recently and many scenes were stolen from my script, which i sent to Mr

 yahaan tak ki unhone meraa kaalpanik seen (rakshabandhan seen) ko bhi chura liya
 Actually Arunachalam Muruganatham has no sister
