 '' Comments pisibi chif shehryaar par lards test main pakistan main mili shandaar jeet ke baad khilaadiyon kaa maang maan lene kaa dabaav tha, lekin jaise hi team duusare test main haari, to unhen samjhaute par kaayam rahane kaa mauka mil gaya or unke sahyogiyon ne bhi unhen aisa hi karne kii salaah de di
 Significantly, many players including captain misbah-ul-haq, Younis Khan, Sarfraz Ahmed, Mohammad Hafeez, Yasir Shah have gone to England with their families

 Due to the handwriting of doctors, understanding the name of the medicine on the prescription of the medicine proves to be a challenge for many people, but soon this problem will be overcome

 kehete hai ki betaa apane pita ke nakshe kadam par chalata he
 This saying fits in with MLC Manorama Devi's son Rocky Yadav in Gaya, Bihar, who is accused of a murder
 uske pita bindi yadav par murder or kidnaping ke kai cese darj hai
 He has at least 17 criminal cases registered against him
 usko gaya jile main bahubali mana jaataa he
 He is also accused of supplying arms to the Naxalites
 vah lambey vakt tak deshadroh ke aarope main jail main band rahaa
 Also known as Entry Mafia in Gaya
 kyonki bihar-jharkhand kii seemaa se guzarane vaale trakon se avaidh vasuuli karne kaa aarope he
 To know the history of Bindi Yadav, one must go to the era of 1991-92, when the reign of terror started in Bihar
 yun kahen ki us daur main jangalraj kaa udai hua tha
 At that time he became synonymous with terror
 bihar ke log us samay bindi or bachchu yadav gang se bhaybheet rahaa karte the
 Born into an ordinary family, Bindi Yadav today owns more than a thousand crore properties
 uske peeche aatank kii vahi kahani he, jisaki badaulat aaj wo arbapati bana hua he
 This gang has occupied dozens of houses in Gaya city
 sarkaar ke kai acre jameen par uskaa kabja he
 In this way many big businessmen were forced to leave the city due to the fear of crime
 usee kaa betaa rocky land rover par savaar hokar nikalataa he or jab gaadi ko said nahin miltaa, to goli maar detaa he
 What else can one expect from such a father's son
 usne jo kiya, apane pita ke padchinhon par chalate hue kiya
 Bindi Yadav became the king of Gaya by killing the infamous Rajan Kurmi of Bihar
 uske baad hatya lut or apharan ke dhandhe main khub tahalaka machaaya
 In lalu-rabri Raj, his handiwork was on the rise
 bubbly jain apharan cond main bhi iskaa naam khub uchhla
 Bindi and Bachchu Yadav together established their supremacy in the entire Magadha region
 naksaliyon ko supplai karata tha hathiyaarbatate hai ki gaya ke mohanpur blaak ke ganesh chak gaanv main paidaa hue bindi yadav ke pita saadhaaran kisaan the
 But in the last 25 years, that wealth has become a Kuber chaar bhaiyon main tisare number kaa bindi shuru se hi aapraadhik pravriti kaa tha
 He had connections with Naxalites
 wo naksaliyon ko hathiyaar gola barood supplai karata tha
 In 2011, he was caught with a string of weapons, including AK-47
 usapar deshadroh or rashtriya suraksha kanoon ke tahat mukadmaa darj hua
 But due to his access and influence, he came out of jail
 vah shuru se argedy se judaa hua tha
 With that, his influence and wealth continued to increase
 khud haara chunaav, patni bani emelsipaisa aayaa to bindi kaa shauk bhi badhaa
 He left his first wife and remarried to Manorama Yadav
 manorama ke pita jiti road par dhaba chalaate the
 He was a resident of Punjab
 manorama yadav se hi rocky yadav kaa janm hua tha
 He made Manorama a member of the Legislative Council from 2003 to 2009 on an RJD ticket
 usne khud argedy or nirdaleey ke rup main 2005 or 2010 main vidhansabha kaa chunaav bhi ladaa, lekin donon baar haar gaya
 On the other hand, the wife won the Legislative Council election on the JDU ticket last year with the support of the RJD and the Congress
 yah bijepi se 16 june ko naata tuutane ke baad vidhansabha kaa pehla satr hoga
 Suddenly, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is seen to be weakening
 bijepi se gathbandhan ke dam par baari bahumat se shashan chalaane ke baad nitish kii jedy (you) ke paas 243 sadasyon vaali vidhansabha main vidhansabha adhyaksh udai narayan choudhary samet kul 118 vidhayak hi rah gaye hai
 This number is four less than the majority
 lekin jedy (you) ke liye acchhee khabar yah he ki bijepi ke paanch vidhayak uski ore aane kaa sanket de rahe hai yaa yah bhi ho saktaa he ki ve jedy (you) kii madad karne ke liye sadan main gaiyrhaazir rahen
 And the bad news is that he has to be given a seat in the Legislative Council at the moment as a reward for changing the party and later to be included in the Cabinet, which might not be right for Nitish's image
 samastipur jile ke mohiuddeen nagar se bijepi vidhayak rana gangeshwar singh pehle hi nitish ko samarthan dene kii baat kah chuke hai, ''nitish kumaar pradhanmantri banane laayak netaa hai
 Whatever happens, i am with them
 '' bijepi rana or unke jaise duusare vidhayakon ke maamle par chuppi saadhe hue he, jabaki party kii khuleam aalochana karne vaale darbhanga jile ke hayaghat se vidhayak amarnath gami ko 21 july ko ''anushaasan todgaye or party virdohi gatividhiyon'' ke liye party se nilambit kar diya gaya tha
 Former Deputy Chief Minister and BJP Legislature Party leader Sushil Kumar Modi is very angry
 ve kehete hai, ''nitish kumaar 26 july se 2 agast tak chalane vaale monsoon satr se pehle hamaare vidhayakon ko todgaye kii koshish main lage hai
 He fears that the government may collapse during voting, as the independent legislators who had promised support on the condition of being made ministers are unhappy about not yet getting a place in the cabinet
 ''patna main 1 anne maarg ke apane nivas par 24 july ko media se baat karte hue nitish ne ''jedy (you) ke bijepi ko todgaye kii koshish karne kii atakalon'' ko khaarij kar diya
 He said, "I don't have this quality
" hamako tod-phod karnaa nahin aata he
 But he also said that an MLA can have his own opinion
 bijepi ke kuch vidhayak bihar main achche shashan kii tarif karnaa chaahate hai
 Nitish Kumar's current concern is to maintain the support of the four independent mlas who, along with Congress mlas, saved the state government during the trust vote on June 19
 lekin jedy (you) nirdaleey vidhayakon par hi nirbhar nahin rahanaa chaahati he
 It is being told that these independent mlas are angry at not getting a place in the cabinet
 nitish ke liye november, 2015 tak 26 maheenon ke liye apni sarkaar bachaae rakhane kii chunauti he
 It is not likely that due to the demands of independent mlas, they will be able to support them for a long time
 centre main upie-2 kii sarkaar ko samarthan dena yaa bihar main unke samarthan ke evaj main congress ke saath gathbandhan karnaa bhi unhen asahaj lag rahaa he
 The profit-loss of this alliance is yet to be estimated
 19 june ko jab nitish sarkaar ne congress ke chaar vidhayakon or chaar nirdaleey vidhayakon tathaa sipiem ke ek vidhayak ke samarthan se vishwaas mat jeeta tha, tabhi sandesh spasht ho gaya tha
 At that time, at least three BJP mlas Amarnath Gami, Veena Devi Singh and Rana Gangeshwar Singh helped him by boycotting voting
 pehali baar vidhayak baniin bijepi vidhayak veena devi jedy (you) ke emelsi dinesh prasad singh kii patni hai
 BJP MLA Rana Gangeshwar Prasad Singh from Mohiuddin Nagar in Samastipur district has also been an old supporter of Nitish Kumar
 nilambit vidhayak amarnath gami ke samarthan main khuleam bol chuke bijepi vidhayak vijay mishra kaa jedy (you) se paariwarik naata rahaa he
 Vijay Mishra, son of former railway minister Lalit Narayan Mishra, is a prominent leader and has close ties with Nitish Mishra, a cabinet minister in the Nitish government
 vijay mishra 1975 se 1980 tak emelsi rahe hai, loksabhaa saansad rah chuke hai or teen baar vidhayak chune ja chuke hai
 However, BJP is currently refraining from taking any action against these disgruntled mlas so that they can be celebrated in future
 bihar main 16 june ko bijepi or jedy (you) gathbandhan tuutane se pehle chandramohan raay ko jedy (you) main aane kaa nyauta diya gaya tha
 At that time he was a BJP minister in the Nitish government
 purv bijepi vidhayak dilip verma kaa bhi kahana he ki nitish sarkaar ko samarthan dene ke badale main unhen mantri banane kii peshkash kii gai thi
 He is currently an Independent MLA from Sikta
 2010 ke chunaav main verma ne sikata se nirdaleey ummidavaar ke rup main chunaav ladaa tha
 Reason: Sikta's seat was given to JD (U) in western Champaran
 unhone india today se kaha, ''maine peshkash ek baar main hi thukraa di
 i am with Narendra Modi
 ''haalanki dal-badal virdohi kanoon kii vajah se bijepi ke kuch vidhayak nitish ke kheme main nahin ja sakate lekin bijepi ko chintaa he ki jab tak vidhansabha adhyaksh—jo jedy (you) se hai—unhen ayogy ghoshit nahin karte, tab tak ve apni seat par bane rahenge
 If they are disqualified, then the number required for the majority will be reduced
 bijepi ke rashtriya pravaktaa or bhagalpur se saansad shahanvaj hossain kaa aarope he ki jedy (you) unke baagi vidhayakon ko laalach de rahaa he ki vidhansabha main agar unki sadsyta khatm ho jaaegi to unke parivaar ke sadasyon ko vidhaan parishad main jagah de di jaaegi
 There are 12 vacancies in the Bihar Legislative Council which are to be filled by the Governor's nomination quota
 rajyapal rajya sarkaar kii sifarish par in sadasyon ko namankit karte hai
 Ever since Nitish Kumar broke ties with the BJP, he has been surrounded by one problem after another
 pichley ek maheene main kai aisi ghatnaayen hui hai, jinase nibatane main bihar prashasan laachaar dikhaai diya he
 Eight people were killed in the Bagaha police firing, followed by a serial bomb blast in Bodh Gaya and then 23 children died in the Mid Day Meal accident
 udhar, rajnatik morche par lalu prasad ko chaara ghotaale main supreme court se badi raahat mil gai he
 It is obvious that all the challenges are standing in front of Nitish Kumar
 cricket kii duniya se raajnneeti main aae imran khan ne aspataal se hi janata se apil kii he ki vah 11 may ko hone vaale chunaavon main unki party pakistan taharik-e-insaaf (piriai) ko vot den or ek ‘nayaa pakistan’ banane main madad karen
 Imran was injured as he fell in an election meeting and is hospitalized

 Imran said, Pakistanis have been ruined by personalities and caste-based politics
 pakistan taharik-e-insaaf ke pratyaashiyon ko vot den taaki ek saath mil kar ham ek nayaa pakistan bana saken
 This appeal has been made by Imran through a video which shows him lying in bed in a hospital with a collar (thick bandage) on his neck

 Everyone fell down
 imran ko sir or peeth main chot ai he
 In the appeal made through the video, Imran said, "I have been fighting for Pakistan for 17 years, which i can do, i have done
 ab main chahta hum ki aap apni jimmedaari uthaaen
 If you want to change your destiny, then you have to take responsibility
 pakistan taharik-e-insaaf ke netaa ne kaha, main chahta hum ki apni sthiti main badlaav ke liye aap sabhi prayaas karen
 On May 11, keep in mind that this fight is not mine but yours, this fight is for the country, to change the fortunes of you and your children
 ’ unhone kaha, apane bacchon ke liye ladaai aapako ladani hogi
 You have to decide whether you want to stay in the present situation or create a new Pakistan
 
 a country where you get rights, respect and where you can live with justice like a human being

 Enthusiasts in the electoral state of Maharashtra have intensified over NCP leader Sharad Pawar's statement regarding Pakistanis and CM Devendra Fadnavis termed it as vote bank politics
 fadanvis ne yah bhi kaha ki bade netaaon ko yah baat dhyaan main rakhni chahie ki kya unke bayaan se bharat ko phayda ho rahaa he yaa pakistan kaa
 He said that Pakistan had used Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's comment on ending the special status of Jammu and Kashmir to target India
 is bich, party ke varisht netaa par ho rahe hamale ke baad rakanpa ne mukhyamantri par aarope lagaaya ki vah pavaar ke bayaan ko apane makasad se tod marod rahe hai
 Former Union Minister Pawar, while addressing a meeting of members of the minority community at the NCP office in Mumbai on Saturday, said that he visited Pakistan several times and was always warmly welcomed
 mukhyamantri ne mahajanadesh yatra ke antim charan main somvaar ko satara jile ke karad main patrakaron se baat karte hue kaha ki pavaar ek bade netaa hai or bade netaaon ko yah samajhnaa chahie ki unke bayanon se bharat ko phayda hoga yaa pakistan ko
 When Rahul Gandhi went to Kashmir he made similar statements
 gandhi ke bayaan ko aadhaar banaate hue pakistan ne agle din sanyukt raashtra main kaha tha ki gandhi ke vichaar unke (pakistan) samaan hai
 While stating the political motive of Pawar's statements, the Chief Minister said that elections will keep coming but it is not right to give such statements for the sake of votes
 rajya main agle maheene vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 He said, 'it seems that Pawar saheb is not aware that Indian Muslims are very proud of India
 agar pavaar ko lagata he ki agar vah is tarah ke bayaan dete hai to musalmaan unhen (NCP ko) vot denge, to vah vichaar hi musalamaanon ke saath anyaay hai
 Fadnavis said that Pawar's statement reflects ncp's 'mentality'
 fadanvis par nishaanaa sadhate hue, rakanpa pravaktaa nawab malik ne kaha ki unhone pavaar ke bayaan ke arth ko nahin samajha
 Malik clarified that Pawar only shared his experience when he visited Pakistan as BCCI president in the past

 However, this formula of Congress has been applicable for the last 3 years in Bihar

 'mrityunjay Tiwari said,' The grand alliance that was formed to stop the vote sharing during the Bihar assembly elections proved to be very effective, due to which the BJP had to face heavy defeat in the elections
 'argedy kaa maananaa he ki agar congress kaa formula sabhi rajyon ke vipakshi dal apana lete hai to 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kaa kahin ata-pataa nahin rahegaa
 Mrityunjay Tiwari said, `` BJP had won in 2014 due to the sharing of votes, but during the last few by-elections, wherever the Grand Alliance has united and fielded only one candidate against the BJP, the BJP lost
 argedy ne kaha, 'kairana se ek sandesh niklaa he jo sabhi vipakshi dalon ko samajhnaa chahie taaki bihar kii tarj par mahagathbandhan sabhi pradeshon main bane
 However, bjp's ally JDU said, "this formula of the Congress cannot become a ground reality, as Congress has always believed in suppressing small parties and maintaining their supremacy
" 'jediu pravaktaa rajeev ranjan ne kaha, 'ek taraf jahaan congress chote dalon ko bada hone kaa mauka nahin detii he

 There has once again been a situation of dispute between the Central Government and the Supreme Court over the appointment of judges
 hai court main jajon kii niyukti ke liye colegium ne 77 jajon ke naam bheje the, jinamein se 43 naamon ko sarkaar ne lautaa diya
 On behalf of the Central Government, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi told the Supreme Court that out of 77 names for the appointment of Collegium headed by Chief Justice, 34 judges have been appointed by the Center
 jabaki inamen se 43 jajon par sarkaar ne sahmati nahin di
 The Center also told the Supreme Court that the government has disposed of all the pending files sent by the collegium
 pichley saal SC ne NJAC ke faisle ko kiya tha raddajajon kii niyuktiko lekar centre sarkaar or supreme court ke bich kaaphi vakt se takaraar chal rahi he

 a mechanic sitting near his lathe machine in Fatwah in Patna district said, "modi has dealt with terrorists, has built toilets for the poor, has opened accounts for them and has helped them build houses in villages
" isi vajah se, BJP ko gathbandhan main baraabar siton (17) par ladane ke liye manaane main kaamyaab rahe nitish kumaar bhi modi ke hi sahare ladate nazar aa rahe hai
 After Modi's big rallies in Sasaram and Buxar, Nitish who reached Nalanda for his rally must have been disappointed to see the size of the crowd
 varsh 2014 main jab vah haar rahe the, unhone isi jagah par zyaada bheed jutai thi
 If we compare Tuesday's rally with the nearby Tejashwi Yadav rally, then Nitish's case seems to be mild
 ek chunavi raily main tejasvi yadavatejasvi ke samarthak kam sulajhe hue ho sakate hai, zyaada shorgul karne vaale ho sakate hai, lekin unhone chaar ghante bahut sabar ke saath unke aane kaa intazaar kiya

 To talk about something, to misinterpret it and to misunderstand what you want to hear from others

 So first of all, peep inside yourself and know what you might get
 'guys please calm down
 
 and get a life
 Twisting, misinterpreting and understanding what you want from what someone has to say is not a reflection on the person who says it but on you
 So self reflect and see who you are and hopefully get a job
 Let me tell you, Sonam Kapoor gave an interview to BBC, in which he described himself as half of Sindhi and half Peshwari clan and also said that it is right to remain silent at this time
 sonam kapur se jab jammu-kashmir se artical 370 hataae jane or do centre shasit pradeshon main baante jane ko lekar sawaal poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'is samay jo halaat hai, inako dekhakar dil tut gaya he or main bahut zyada deshbhakt hum

 yadi aap maamuli yuasabi drive banane kii factory lagaana chaahate hai, jo china se is kadar aayaat hoti hai ki sarkaar ke mek in india kaa byoraa bhi patrakaron ko china main bani pen drive main diya gaya tha, to jameen hasil karne ke liye aapako congressi raaj ke usee kanoon se jujhna hoga, jo vitt mantri arun jetali ke mutabik ikkisvin sadi kii jaruraton ke mafik nahin he
 However, if you want to build an expressway, industrial park or luxury hotel-hospital in collaboration with the government, according to the new ordinance, you will get an apology from the terms of assessing the farmers' consent or the impact on the livelihood of the project
 yah us bahes kii baangi he jo wibrant gujarat or bengal ke bhavy aayojanon ke haashie se uthi he or nivesh ke kaalpanik aankadon main dabane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Don't mistake it as a manufacturing versus infrastructure debate, because India needs both
 sawaal yah he ki jameen kii sahaj supplai main variyata kise milani chahie, nirantar rojgaar dene vaale menuphacturer ko yaa phir dihadi rojgaar dene vaale ‘‘bob da builder’’ ko? mek in india ke tahat takanic, innovations laane vaali menuphaccharing ko yaa toll road banaate hue, coloniyaan kaat dene vaale develper ko?jaminen jatil sansaadhan hai
 For one, it is a pure livelihood, for another it is the raw material for the project, while for a third, the land becomes the basic formula for profit
 jameen adhigrahan ke nae kanoon or usamen tabadatod badlaavon ne in teenon hiton kaa santulan bigaad diya he
 Under the old law (1894) there were arbitrary acquisitions in which the farmers did not get adequate compensation
 pichhali sarkaar ne vipahn kii sahmati se nae kanoon main 21veen sadi kaa muaavja to sunishchit kar diya lekin nayaa kanoon kisaanon kii siyasat par kendrit tha isliye vikaas ke liye jameen kii supplai tham gai
 The manner in which the BJP has liberalized the law through ordinarial changes, the benefits are turning towards select investors, which will further complicate the ground
 kheti ke alaava, jameen ke utpaadak istemaal ke do model hai
 An infrastructure is projects where land itself is the basic foundation of business and profits
 doosraa graahak menuphaccharing he jahaan niveshkon ke liye bhoomi, pariyojna kii laagat kaa hissaa he, kyonki factory kaa munafa takanic or pratispardhaa par nirbhar he
 There can be no dispute over the basic role and need of road, electricity, housing, airport, but one has to accept that government policies are also victims of the infrastructure gland
 aarthik vikaas kii adhikansh bahasein buniyadi dhaanche kii kami se shuru hoti hai
 The government's direct participation in concessions, credit facilities and projects (similar to ppp-government Guarantee) is also enjoyed by just a dozen industries or services
 sarkaar kii variyata bainkon kii bhi variyata he isliye, infrastracchar or pipipi pariyojnaon main baari karj fansaa he
 The amended Land Acquisition Act will facilitate land supply but only for infrastructure industries
 in udyogon main chaar guna keemat dekar kharidi gai jameen se bhi munafa kamanaa sambhav he kyonki makaan, airport or express-ve ityadi banane main jameen ke kaarobaari istemaal kii anant sambhaavnaaen hai
 Although far from cheap land for the manufacturing industry, they have to accept all the conditions from which the infrastructure developer has been relieved
 infrastracchar ke liye suvidhaayen or riyaayaten pehle se hai, menuphaccharing ko lekar utsaah, modi ke mek in india abhiyaan ke baad badha he
 Manufacturing brings permanent and trained employment, while the construction industry consumes daily and unskilled labor
 niveshak yah samaj rahe the ki sarkaar sthaayee naukariyon ko lekar gambhir he isliye menuphaccharing ko badhaava milegaa
 It is important to keep in mind that hundreds of industries come under the ambit of manufacturing, whereas for the industries for which the law has been liberalized, there are only a handful of big companies
 isliye badlaavon kaa phayda chuninda udyogon or companiyon ke haq main jane ke aarope badhate jaaenge
 The bjp's problem is that many changes in the previous land acquisition law came from the recommendation of a parliamentary committee headed by Sumitra Mahajan, the current Lok Sabha speaker
 sarvadaleey baithkon se lekar sansad tak bijepi ne behad sakriyata ke saath jis nae bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon kii pairvi kii, nae sanshodhan uske vipareet hai
 The Congress government had made an all-party consensus on the new law, the BJP did not even understand the need to test the political temperature before these sensitive changes
 darasal, modi sarkaar bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon ko tarksangat banane kaa mauka chook gai he
 The law could be made practical by including industries including manufacturing so that employment investment would be encouraged
 vaise bhi infrastracchar ke liye jameen kaa vyapak or ekamusth adhigrahan chahie jinamein samay lagata he
 Opportunities could be reduced with the help of employment generation by increasing the supply of land for manufacturing
 congress ne nayaa kanoon banaate hue or bijepi ne ise badalte hue is tathy kii andekhi kii he ki jameen kaa adhiktam utpaadak istemaal behad jaruri he
 The Land Acquisition Act of the Congress was not suited to the needs of development but after the BJP changes, it has neither been suitable for the Make in India nor the farmers
 bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon 21veen sadi kaa to he magar na kisaan iske saath hai or na bahusankhyak udyog
 Now in the coming months, the land will produce not only development and employment, but also crop of politics
 madhyapradesh ke udyog mantri kailash vijayawargeey ne congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ko kamedian qaraar dete hue kaha ki jis prakaar filmon main manoranjan ke liye hasya kalakaar kii bhoomika hoti he, usee tarah kii bhoomika samaacharon main bane rahane ke liye digvijay singh congress main nibhaa rahe hai
 Vijayvargiya, who came to Harda on personal stay, told the language that no one pays much attention to Singh's words
 unhone kaha ki singh ko congress dwaara pradeshbadar kar diya gaya he, isliye apni jagah banane kii khatir ve anargal bayaanbaji karte rahete hai
 The outspoken cabinet minister of the state said that this is what Digvijay Singh is doing against those who have entered the society like Anna Hazare, Baba Ramdev
 bhaajapa se rajyasabha sadsy raghunandan sharma dwaara haal hi ujjain main mukhyamantri or mantriyon ke khilaaf die bayaan ke sambandh main puche jane par vijayawargeey ne kaha ki yah unke nijee vichaar ho sakate hai or unka bayaan ‘‘kahin par nigahen, kahin par nishaanaa’’ jaisaa ho saktaa he

 ' sansadon main is baat ko lekar charchaa tej he ki aakhir ve agadon ko 10 fisadi kaa aarakshan dene kii baat par satr ke aakhri din charchaa kyon kar rahe hai
 Obviously, no one can oppose this bill, so everyone has to pass this bill together
 magar sabake man main ek hi sawaal he ki ab kya
 
 
 The Lok Sabha election is on the head and are there more such cases for which they should be prepared? Yes, this was being discussed among the mps in the corridor of Parliament
 log ab garib savarnon ko 10 fisadi kaa aarakshan die jane par napha nuksaan kii baat kar rahe hai ki isse kya bijepi kii kismat 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main badalegi yaa abhi kuch or bhi tir baaki hai, modi ji ke tarkash main
 
 
 Many BJP mps and even some Union ministers believe that this law will give a new impetus to the BJP workers, especially those who were troubled by Rahul Gandhi's attack on Rafael
 kuch kaa maananaa he ki is bill ke paas hone se pradhanmantri ke lagaataar girte graph par brake lag jayega, chijen badalani shuru ho jaaengi
 
 or congress ke savarna botbank main send lagaai ja sakati he
 a BJP MP said that look, for two days no one is even taking Rafael's name
 magar vipaksh ke kuch saansadon kaa maananaa he ki savarna bahul siton par bijepi pehle se hi acha kar rahi he or isse un siton par khaas fark nahin padegaa ulte bihar or uttarapradesh main mandalvaadi partiyaan jaise rajd or samaajawaadee party ise ulte dhang se pesh karengi ki yah to shuruyaat he pichhadon or daliton ke aarakshan ko khatm karne kii kyonki aresas hameshaa se aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan ke paksh main rahi he or ek baar phir aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ke us bayaan kaa hawala diya jayega jisamen ve isi tarah ke aarakshan kii vakaalat karte najar aa rahe hai
 But the biggest question is that the reservation of upper castes was a trump card that Modi ji pulled out of his box or there may be more
 isaki kuch bhanak kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne apane rajyasabha main die bhaashan main di jisamen unhone kaha ki abhi or bhi chakke lagenge
 If you listen to the corridor of the Parliament, then the next new trump card is a plan by Modi ji to increase income for farmers
 iske tahat kisaanon ke khaaton main sidhe paise daalana
 That is, farmers will be given Rs 4000 thousand per acre at the time of sowing of every crop
 yah ek aisi yojana he jise telugana main chandrashekhar raav lagu kar chuke hai or jawaab main janata ne unhen badi jeet se satta main waapas bheja
 Now, on the lines of this, Prime Minister Modi is planning to implement it for farmers across the country
 aakhir kisaan ab desh main bada mudda ban chukaa he jise philhal rahul gandhi le ude hai or modi ji pichhadate najar aa rahe hai
 This is the reason why the Prime Minister does not want to back down now and the plan can be announced soon
 doosraa bada nirnay farvari main bajet main aayega
 If the whispers of mps in the corridors of Parliament are accepted, then the government can bring about a big change in the income tax slab
 vaise sarkaar is baat kaa gungan kar rahi thi ki itnaa tex ikattha hua or itnaa paisa sarkaar ke paas khajaane main aayaa he
 That is why it is being said that the government can increase the income tax limit to 4 lakhs
 
 
 he na mjedaar khabar
 
 sansad ke is satr ke antim din is tarah kii khabar bijepi saansadon ke liye raahat kii baat he, magar vipaksh ke saansad abhi kah rahe the ki ab kuch nahin ho saktaa badi ho gai he
 
 ek vipakshi saansad ne kaha ki badi der kar di hujur aate-aate
 
 ab ye sabhi saansad apane-apane kshetron main chale gaye hai or milenge bajet satr ke dauraan farvari main
 Let's see what happens between them, they will also discuss with you

 andhvishwaas kaa str is kadar tha ki maut ke baad bhi mahila ko graminon ne der tak uthne nahin diya
 Administration and police officials were present on the spot throughout the night
 mahila samadhi lene se ek din pehle hi gangapore siti se gram koyala main ai thi or agle din hi subah puja paath kar samadhi le lee
 'do not be teased during Samadhi' People with superstitions present near the Samadhi said that the woman had said before Samadhi that she should not be teased

 'raji' ke ye number is myne bhi hausala badhaane vaale hai kyonki film heroin oriented he
 The film has done well in the metro centers and after that Word of Mouth has also acted in the film's favorite
 vaise bhi 'raji' ek spi drama he, jisamen aalia ek aisi ladki kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahi hai jo pakista main rahakar bharat ke liye jasusi karti he
 It seems natural to have responsibility for fast bowling and playing under the leadership of an aggressive captain
 zyaadaatar jaankaar isse inkaar nahin karte ki tej gendbaaj josh main rahakar hi apana sahi asar chhod sakate hai, lekin unke mutabik josh main hone ke saath hosh kii seemaa nahin langhi ja sakati
 Former captain Sunil Gavaskar says that team management should tell Virat and the players to use anger properly
 unka yah bhi maananaa he ki khilaadi 50 yaa 100 ran banaae yaa phir koi gendbaaj wicket le, to unhen khush hona chahie naa ki gussa hokar uskaa phayda ganvaa dena chahie
 Gavaskar says that by doing this, he will be seen doing his own harm by getting stuck in the rules of the game
 tippaniyan Virat is completely different from former captain Dhoni
 shakhsiyat ke taur par bhi or captain ke taur par bhi
 While Dhoni believed in aggressive cricket as a strategy, Virat believes in the result through aggressive play at every opportunity
 viraat kehete bhi hai, "halaat jaise hai vaise rahane dijie, yah mauka jashn manaane kaa he
 " viraat ke formule se team india ne badi kamyaabi hasil kii he, lekin isaki seemaa kya honi chahie
 It will be fixed in a long time
 purv captain sunil gavaskar kehete hai ki team manjament ko viraat or khilaadiyon ko bataanaa chahie ki vah gusse kaa sahi istemaal karen
 He also believes that if the players score 50 or 100 runs or if a bowler takes a wicket, then they should be happy and not lose their advantage by getting angry
 gavaskar kehete hai ki aisa karne par vah game ke niyamon main funskar apana hi nuksaan karte najar aaenge
 The comments viraat purv captain dhoni se bilkul alag hai
 Also as a person and as a captain
 dhoni ranneeti ke taur par aakraamak cricket main bharosa rakhte the, to viraat har maukey par aakraamak khel ke jariye nattejey main bharosa rakhte hai
 Virat also says, "let the circumstances remain as they are, this is a chance to celebrate
 " With the formula of Virat, Team India has achieved great success, but what should be its limit
 yah lambey samay main hi tay ho sakegaa
 Virat is completely different from former captain Dhoni
 shakhsiyat ke taur par bhi or captain ke taur par bhi
 While Dhoni believed in aggressive cricket as a strategy, Virat believes in the result through aggressive play at every opportunity
 viraat kehete bhi hai, "halaat jaise hai vaise rahane dijie, yah mauka jashn manaane kaa he

 australian team bhale hi vanade world cap main sabase zyada paanch baar champion rahi ho or inhen test or vanade main duniya main number 1 team kaa rutaba hasil rahaa ho, lekin world tii-20 kaa khitaab is team se ab tak dur hi rahaa he
 The same thing remains for Australian fans, whose pain the champion team feels equal
 australian captain steven smith kehete hai, "ye ek trophy hamase dur rahi he
 We want to win all the tournaments
 hamaari team sadhi hui he
 Our 15 players can compete in this tournament
 " paanchavin ranking vaali australian team ke captain steven smith kii world cap se pehle ye hunkaar unki team kaa hausala jarur badha sakati he
 How much other teams favor it is another matter
 isisi world tii-20 main paanchaven number kii australian team ke hausale buland hone kii ek khaas vajah yah bhi he ki is team ne isi maheene dakshin africa jaisi team ko unheen kii jameen par 2-1 se shikast di he
 World ranking of South Africa is also better than Australia (1
 bharat 2
 West Indies 3
 dakshin africa 4

 The comments australian team olerounder khilaadiyon se bhari he
 Captain Steven Smith believes that having all-rounder players in the T20 format can have a significant impact on the outcome of the match
 shaayad inhen khilaadiyon ke bharose captain smith bharat main itihaas rachane kaa iraadaa rakh rahe hai
 In the International T20, the Australian team has won 42 of the 84 matches or 50 per cent of the matches and at the moment there seems to be a tight team, but it had to face defeat on its own ground from the hands of India
 jab bharat or australia kii timen upmahadweep kii pich par takaraaengi (27 march ko mohali main) to mehmaan team us haar kaa dabaav jarur mahasoos karegi
 Australian captain Steven Smith says, "this one trophy has been far from us
 ham saare toornament jeetna chaahate hai
 Our team is firm
 hamaare 15 khilaadi is toornament main dhamal kar sakate hai
 "this hunker before the fifth-ranked Australian team captain Steven Smith's World Cup can definitely boost his team's spirits
 duusari timen ise kitna tavajjo detii he, ye or baat he
 a special reason for the number five Australian team being freshly elevated in the ICC World T20 is that this team defeated a team like South Africa 2–1 on their own ground this month
 dakshin africa kii world ranking bhi australia se behatar he (1
 India 2
 west indies 3

 Australia)
 tippaniyan The Australian team is full of all-rounder players
 captain steven smith maanate hai ki tii-20 formet main olerounder khilaadiyon kaa hona match ke nattejey par ahm asar daal saktaa he
 Perhaps with these players, Captain Smith is planning to create history in India
 antarrashtriya tii-20 main australian team ne 84 main se 42 match yani 50 fisadi maichon main jeet hasil kii he or philhal ek sadhi hui team najar aa rahi he, lekin bharat ke haathon se ise apni hi jameen par haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 When the Indian and Australian teams hit the subcontinent's pitch (in Mohali on 27 March), the visiting team will surely feel the pressure of that defeat
 isisi world tii-20 main paanchaven number kii australian team ke hausale buland hone kii ek khaas vajah yah bhi he ki is team ne isi maheene dakshin africa jaisi team ko unheen kii jameen par 2-1 se shikast di he

 Harish Salve believes that the manner in which the court has asked Pakistan to review its judicial process has not only appeased the heart, but has won the victory of the rule of law

 BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agarwal said, 'the government is playing a communal game, because in general, even though illegals are doing a majority of the work of cow protection, but whether mob lynching is only done by the guards, political malfeasance also leads to mob lynching
 keval gaurakshakon par kyon sabhi vishyon par, jo supreme court ne kaha he uske hisaab se kanoon bananaa chaiye

 This includes professionals, entrepreneurs, ex-army officers and bureaucrats from the Sikh community
 sikh forum kaa gathan bangladesh yuddh ke hero leftinent general jagajeet singh aroda ne kiya tha

 Sodhi expressed satisfaction over the assurance given by NCM member Manjit Singh Rai
 sikh forum ko ummid he ki ensiem ke dakhal ke baad shilong main saamaanya sthiti puri tarah behaal ho jaaegi
 After May 29, there was a sense of curfew in Shillong
 vahaan sthiti par kaabo paane ke liye ardhsainik balon ko bhi bulaanaa padaa
 However, there have been contradictory statements on why there was a confrontation between the Dalit Sikhs and the Khasi community in Shillong
 kuch reports main ekapunjabimahila ke kathith utpeedan or kuch main parking par vivaad ke baad takaraav hone kii baat kahi gai
 Rumors on whatsapp also added to the tension
 dilli se sate noida main prastaavit damping yard ke virodh main saikadon log sadak par utar aae hai

 In 72 incidents of peak cutting, people took the law into their own hands and beat up innocent people in the Kashmir Valley
 sabhi 72 maamalon main praathmiki darj kii jaaegi or police shararti tatwon se sakhti se nipategi
 No case has been registered against innocent people
 DGP said that no case will be registered against innocent people handed over to police by the public on suspicion of cutting off the peak
 iske alaava police adhikari bhi media ko sabhi tathyon se spasht taur par avgat karavaaen
 Special investigation teams have been formed in all the districts
 samaaj kalyaan or swasthya vibhaag ke adhikari bhi unamem shaamil hai
 Some people do not want peace and normalcy
 The Health Department should deploy teams that meet the victims who have been detained

 The peak cutting occurred in many parts of North India, after which it began in Jammu
 aise maamle dakshin, madhya or uttar kashmir main bhi hue, lekin kashmir main aise tatv hai jo yahaan shanti or saamaanya halaat nahin chaahate
 India's campaign in the Twenty20 World Cup suffered a major setback on Tuesday when offensive opener Virender Sehwag was ruled out of the tournament due to a shoulder injury
 chayankartaaon ne indian premier lig main behtareen farm main chal rahe murali vijay ko sahvaag ke vikalp ke taur par team main shaamil kiya he jabaki gautam gambhir ko nayaa upakptain banaaya gaya he
 BCCI Secretary n Srinivasan said in a statement, 'virender Sehwag has suffered a shoulder injury and has been advised rest for three to four weeks
 isliye vah isisi vishwa twanti 20 toornament se baahar ho gayi hai
 'he said,' The ICC Technical Committee has approved for their option 
 akhil bhartiya senior chayan samiti ne murali vijay ko chunaa he
 Incidentally, Sehwag was also injured during the 2009 T20 World Cup
 vah tab team ke saath england gayi the lekin unhone vahaan koi match nahin khelaa
 This opener, however, did not do well in the IPL where his team could not even reach the Delhi Daredevils semi-finals
 sahvaag deccan chargers ke khilaaf ravivaar ko apni team ke antim lig match main khele the lekin vah aath ran hi bana paye
 He was dismissed by Chaminda Vaas
 iske vipareet chennai superkings ke ballebaaj vijay ipel main bejod farm main chal rahe hai or unhone rajasthan rails ke khilaaf keval 56 gend main 127 ran kii pari kheli thi
 It will definitely have an impact on the batting attack of the Indian team because having an explosive batsman like Sehwag would have strengthened the team
 sahvaag ke jane ke baad ab tii-20 vishwa cap ke liye bhartiya team is prakaar hogi:-mahendra singh dhoni (captain), suresh raina, yuvaraj singh, gautam gambhir(up captain), murali vijay, yusuf pathan, rohit sharma, ravinder jadeja, aar vinay kumaar, jahir khan, ashish nehra, praveen kumaar, harbhajan singh, piyush chawla or dinesh karthik

 punjab main aam aadmi party ke bheetar kalah khulkar najar aane lagi he
 After being removed from the post of Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly, Sukhpal Khaira has started an open rebellion, demanding that the party be given complete independence in Punjab
 guuruuvaar(2 agast) kosukhpal khayrane bhatinda main party samarthakon kii baithak bulaai he, jisamen khera samarthakon kaa daawa he ki punjab main aam aadmi party ke zyaadaatar vidhayak unke saath dikhaai denge
 Ahead of the rebels' show of power in Punjab, the Aam Aadmi Party has indicated to the Punjabi unit that in such a situation it will take stern action against the rebels
 sisodiya ne bataaya-party virdohi gatividhiam aadmi party ke punjab prabharee manish sisodiya ne 2 agast ko bhatinda main hone vaali is baithak ko party virdohi gatividhi qaraar diya he
 Sukhpal Khaira expressed his displeasure over this order of Manish Sisodia on social media, terming it a dictatorial attitude
 khera ne khulkar elaan kiya ki guuruuvaar ko bhatinda main hone vaali raily se is puure vivaad ko ek saath hi khatm kar diya jayega
 After the removal of Sukhpal Khaira, the Aam Aadmi Party appointed the party's Dalit MLA Harpal Seema as the Leader of Opposition in the Punjab Assembly, on which Sukhpal Khaira and his faction MLA Kanwar Sandhu opposed it in a meeting with Manish Sisodia
 kanvar sandhu ne kaha tha ki agar party punjab main dalit ko cheharaa bananaa chaahati he to kyon na pradesh adhyaksh kisi dalit ko banaaya jaae
 AAP divided into two factions The Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab has split into two factions
 aam aadmi party sutron kaa kahana he ki sukhpal khera ke paksh main chaar vidhayak hai , jisamen kanvar sandhu bhi shaamil hai
 In such a situation, the Delhi leadership of the Aam Aadmi Party is keeping its eye on the rally to be held in Bathinda on Thursday
 party sutron kaa kahana he ki is raily main aane vaale sabhi netaaon par party virdohi gatividhi ke tahat kadi karrwai kii jaaegi, jisamen sadasyon kaa nilamban tak kiya ja saktaa he
 Just before Bhai Kharani Saheli, on social media, raised the demand of the party's chief Arvind Kejriwal and Punjab in-charge Manish Sisodia to give full strength to the Punjab unit of the party in the interest of the people of Punjab and democracy
 vahiin party ke dilli netritv ko lagata he ki agar uske paanch vidhayak baagi hote hai or alag gut banaate hai to vah khud-ba-khud defections lau ke tahat apni sadsyta kho denge
 Therefore, the Delhi leadership of the Aam Aadmi Party is not too worried about this activity happening in Punjab
 haalanki loksabhaa chunaav ke thik pehle aisi khuli baghawat ko lekar party apni taiyaari bhi kar rahi he
 It is believed that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal himself may soon visit Punjab and bugle the preparations for the Lok Sabha elections, but before that the party is preparing to take action on the rebels to teach a lesson of discipline
 sukhpal khera ne lagaaya aropasukhpal khera ne aarope lagaaya he ki pichley 48 ghanton main unke khilaaf kai tarah kii sajishein kii ja rahi hai or ye failaayaa ja rahaa he ki wo akali dal ke sampark main hai
 It is also being said that the Congress is helping us to make the meeting in Bathinda a success
 sukhpal khera ne kaha ki wo ye baithak sirf or sirf punjab ke logon or unke muddon ke liye kar rahe hai or ise rokane ke liye bevajaah is tarah kii afvaahen failaa kar unke or unke saathi vidhayakon ke khilaaf maahaul banaaya ja rahaa he
 Khaira said he feared that such conspiracies could increase further within the next 24 hours
 kai tarah ke photograph or soshal media ke post viral karke unhen badnaam karne kii koshish kii ja sakati he
 And their opponents do not want a huge crowd to gather in this meeting at any cost
 sukhpal khera or kanvar sandhu ne apni hi party ke virodhiyon or vipakshi partiyon kaa naam nahin liya he
 He has neither told who is doing this conspiracy
 lekin unhone saaf kar diya he ki har haal main ye baithak hone ja rahi he
 Both leaders have appealed to the people of Punjab and nris sitting abroad to send a large number of people from their village to this meeting and make it a success
 sukhpal khera or kanvar sandhu ne party main hi apane virdohi vidhayakon or dilli alaakaman ke khilaaf kuch nahin bolaa
 Sukhpal Khaira said that he will also answer the questions and apprehensions raised in the minds of his party workers through this meeting
 agra-lakhanu express-ve par lagaataar badhate sadak haadason ke baad i-chaalaan karne kaa faisla liya gaya he
 Now, the system of e-challan has been implemented for driving at a higher speed than the prescribed limit on the agra-lucknow Expressway

 He said that the slightest negligence is proving fatal due to the high speed
 avasthi ne bataaya, 'uttar pradesh deveopment athurity ne agra or lakhanu donon toll plaza par yah vyavastha kii he ki agar koi vaahan agra se lakhanu yaa lakhanu se agra tak kii duuri 3 ghante se kam samay main tay kar letaa he to uskaa chaalaan kiya jayega

 bijepi or jediu ke netaa ek duusare par aarope lagane main itane aage ja chuke hai ki bayanon or gaali main antar karnaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 If JDU veteran leaders do not feel any hesitation in calling Modi a 'terrorist', then BJP leaders are describing JDU and Indian Mujahideen as being on the same plate
 jaraa netaaon ke shabdon par gaur kariye andaja ho jayega ki bihar main raajnneetik baukhalaahat kaha pahunch gai he
 While Bihar Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh called Narendra Modi the biggest 'terrorist' and 'bloody', bjp's Giriraj Singh said in Ahmedabad that 'nitish Kumar had set the Indian Mujahideen to kill Narendra Modi
 'yahi nahin somvaar ko bihar bijepi ke varisht netaa or purv mantri ashvini choube ne to nitish ko nark main jane or agle janm main keedaa banakar janm lene kaa shraap de diya
 When both these parties were abused, then where would RJD be left behind? rabari devi ne narendra modi ko 'ravan' to nitish ko 'kansa' qaraar de daalaa
 Ever since BJP blamed Nitish for his blasts at Modi's rally
 indian mujahiddeen ke saath jediu ke sambandhon ko jodna shuru kiya he tabhi se jediu ne bhi narendra modi ke liye aantki, dangai, balavai or hatyara jaise shabdon kaa prayog khulkar karnaa shuru kar diya he
 Nitish Kumar also surprised everyone recently by saying that 'the terrorists had made the BJP rally a success
 'darasal yahi bijepi jab nitish ke saath satta main thi to sab thik tha, lekin satta se baahar aate hi unhen shraap dene tak par utar ai he
 The same situation is with the JDU who were with the BJP till yesterday, they were seen as sadhus by the BJP, but today terrorists have started appearing

 Needed | # crimesofsoniagandhi — Kailash Vijayvargiya (@kailashonline) May 2, 2016 bihar ke hajipur main pitayee kii bhayanak tasviren saamne ai hai
 Where a person was beaten up on the first charge of mobile theft
 lekin baad main usne peetane vaale shaks ko bhi usee tarah se berahami se peeta
 The case was of mobile theft
 ek shaks par iljaam laga
 Then one man will beat the other with a leather belt
 or doosraa ginati karata rahaa
 The third was watching the spectacle, the fourth was instigating the beating
 paanchavaa video bana rahaa tha
 And the molester was ready to kill that person
 bihar ke hajipur kii tasviren viral ho gai
 There was such a beating that on seeing this, the soul groaned
 aisi maar ki dekhakar siharan ho jaae
 In such a way that the hearts of those who see it are filled with panic ek aadmi ko duusare aadmi ko chamade kii belt se peethta rahaa
 The viral video shows how the afflicted man is trying to protect himself, and the man is constantly raining his belt
 belt ke saath-saath doosraa aadmi us par danda se waar kar rahaa he
 After almost tearing the skin, the man who beat him confessed to the crime of the person being beaten on camera
 pitane vaala kah rahaa he ki usne mobile churaayaa he
 Amit's mobile
 ab aage se nahin churayega
 Things changed a little after the beating of the accused of mobile theft
 jo aadmi pehle chamade kii belt se peet rahaa tha, ab vahi aadmi gaanv waalon ke saamne pit rahaa he
 Just as the accused had previously showered the belt on the victim, so has the belt on it
 jis tarah se uski pitayee kaa video banaaya ja rahaa tha, thik vaise hi is aadmi kaa bhi video banaaya ja rahaa he
 This man was beaten up because he stole the mobile
 magar isadmi kii pitayeekyon rahi he
 Understand that as well
 darasal, pitayee ke dauraan us aadmi ne mobile chori karne vaale ko jati kii gaali di thi
 Because of abusing the caste, all the people of that caste gathered, and they beat the man who beat them fiercely
 hairaan karne vaali baat ye he ki ek hi gaanv ke do logon ke bich is kadar bhayanak marpet hui, lekin majaal he ki nitish babu kii police kahin aas paas dikh gai ho
 There was no trace of the guardians of the law far and wide

 rigerv bank ke dipti governorviral acharyane bainkon keeswaittataki vakaalat kii he
 Acharya said that the government should stop playing 20-20 matches with the banks, otherwise it could have disastrous consequences
 sibiai main jis vakt centre sarkaar ke hastkshep ko lekar bhuuchaal machaa he, thik usee samay bainkon kii swaittata par acharya kii salaah mahatvapurn maani ja rahi he
 There are frequent complaints of alliances between banks and ministers and leaders
 badhate enpie or bainkon kaa paisa lekar videsh bhaage vittiya aparaadhiyon ke saath netaaon-naukarshahon ke sambandh par bhi sawaal uthte rahe hai
 In such a situation, by raising the demand for 'freedom' for the banks, Acharya has tried to show that if the banks work according to themselves, then the situation can improve, or else they should be prepared for the disastrous result
 '20-20 match nahin test khelo'edi shroff memorial lacture main acharya ne kaha, 'jo centre sarkaar central bainkon kii aazaadee kii kadra nahin karti, use der saber vittiya bazaaron kii naaraazgi kaa shikaar hona padataa he
 The result of ignoring important regulatory institutions is disastrous
 ' acharya ne aage kaha, central bainkon ko aazaadee di jaae to isse kai phaayde hai, jaise ki isse karj kii laagat ghatati he, antarrashtriya nivesh badhata he or bank lambey vakt tak jinda rahete hai
 This matter of the Deputy Governor of RBI is considered important because in many states there are assembly elections as well as general elections in 2019
 acharya ke mutabik, bainkon ke maamle main faisle twanti-twanti match (jaldi main) kii tarah liye ja rahe hai
 Acharya said, 'there are always elections in the country

 It is quicker to fulfill the earlier promises as soon as elections are near

 On the question of reducing the interest rate, Acharya said that by reducing it more, the debt increases, which in turn leads to inflation

 iske baad vah hamen rajkeey atithi ke taur par rajya main ganatantr diwas dhwajarohan samaaroh main shaamil hone ke liye aamantrit karte hai
 Describing Umar's invitation as unacceptable, Thakur alleged that Omar was suppressing the voice of nationalist elements and giving moral strength to separatist elements in the Kashmir Valley
