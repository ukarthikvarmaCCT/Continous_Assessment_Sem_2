 a controversial essay of Ramanujan on Ramayana has recently been published in Hindi called Three hundred Ramayana
 dilli vivi ke course main ise pratibandhit karne ke alaava ise lekar tamaam bahes-muvaahisa or uthapatak ho chuki he
 The decision to print it in Hindi was courageous and it is not an aged scholar who showed courage, but a 25-year-old girl, Aditi Maheshwari, who is trying to break the shackles of Hindi publishing business
 yun to aditi aanshik taur par kaaphi samay se pita ke vyavsaay vaani prakaashan main sakriy thim, lekin tata institute of soshal sciensej, mumbai se emphil karne ke baad pichley do saal se ve puri tarah is kaam se jud gai hai
 Aditi, who calls herself a Feminist, is focused on publishing books on Feminist subjects
 sirf kavita-kahani hi nahin, darshan, vichaar, itihaas kii kitaaben unki praathamikta hai
 30-year-old Priyanka Malhotra, after doing her msc in Media and Communication from London School of Economics, started her family's traditional publication Hind Pocket Books
 ve kahati hai ki aaj vahi product safal he, jo youth ko apni ore khinch saktaa he
 'therefore, we are insisting on printing such simple and useful books which the youth are interested in reading
 'hindi prakaashan vyavsaay ko lekar lekhakon-vichaarkon ke bich hameshaa ek bahes or vivaad kii sthiti rahi he
 For a long time it has been believed that Hindi publishing works like a rooted institution
 haalanki kabhi rajbhasha hone ke naate milane vaale phaayde to kabhi hindi pustakon kii sarkari kharid aalochana ke nishane par rahe
 But the new generation is breaking these concepts
 mahaj 24 saal ke alind maheshwari hindi ke bade prakaashan raajakmal ke sabase kam umr ke vaaris hai
 S
 of Mumbai pi
 He has been handling publishing since last two years before pursuing MBA from Jain College
 bakaul alind, 'hamaara makasad he hindi publication ko modern or profeshnal bananaa
 Internet was another world thing for publication before he started his work
 alind ne hindi kitabon ko sibar spes main le jane kaa kaam kiya
 Creating the website of the publication, providing detailed information of all the books on the website, as well as the introduction of online orders, the response is quite impressive
 zyada nahin, mahaj 3-4 saal pehle tak flipcart or shop 18 vagairah i-shopping cites hindi ke liye anjaane the
 But today almost all the big publishers of Hindi books including Rajkamal are present on these websites
 alind kehete hai ki aane vaala bazaar online he
 Therefore, Hindi publishing has to strengthen its feet in the Internet world
 2012 ke pustak meley main ek nai baat dekhne ko mili
 The youth, who usually appear in English stalls or in the interest of books like Chetan Bhagat, appeared on the stalls of Hindi publishers in large numbers
 isaki vajah talashne jaaen to pataa chalata he ki hindi kitabon kii shandaar packaging, behtareen kaagaj par chape cover or digining yuvaaon ko aakarshith kar rahe hai
 This is a new thing for Hindi
 iske pehle hindi prakashkon ke liye production quality koi mudda hi nahin tha
 The paper used to be so bad that within 10-15 years, it used to burst yellow
 lekin ab yah manjar badalata dikhaai de rahaa he
 Books with glossy paper, beautiful covers and strong packaging are now commonplace
 apane prakaashan ke sau varsh kaa jashn manaa rahe hindi prakaashak raajapaal and sans kii bagdor is vakt 29 varshiya pranav johari sambhaal rahe hai
 After completing his Masters in Finance from the University of Wisconsin in Madison, USA, Pranav had a lot of opportunities in the United States with great salaries
 lekin unhone chaar pidiyon se chale aa rahe apane hindi prakaashan vyavsaay ko aage badhaane kaa rasta chunaa
 He says, 'hindi books could not attract readers due to their poor production quality
 maine quality par kaaphi jor diya he
 The books we published in both Hindi and English have the same cover, quality, lay-out, etc
 ab ham garv se kah sakate hai ki production ke maamle main hindi kitaaben angreji se katai kamatar nahin hai
 'if Hindi books want to come out of the clutches of government procurement of the Kolkata-based Raja Rammohun Roy library and do not want to get dusty in the libraries, they will have to shape their look to reach the hands of thousands of readers
 kitabgar prakaashan ke yuva prakaashak manoj sharma kehete hai, 'librari main to koi bhi kitaab chali jaati he, lekin agar pathakon kaa dhyaan kheenchna he to production quality ko umdaa bananaa padegaa
 'it was another era when his grandfather and father were satisfied with selling books in library purchases, but today all young publishers have concerns and efforts on how to reach readers by printing cheap paperback books
 bakaul alind, 'raajakmal main pehle hardbound par hi zyada jor hota tha, lekin ab ham sabhi kitabon ke hardbound or saste paperbaque sanskaran ek saath chhap rahe hai
 According to him, hardbound is good for the library, but the general readers can only be reached through cheap paperback books
 saath hi alind ne ek nayaa prayog bhi kiya he
 He plans to start a chain of small book-stores across the country
 isaki shuruyaat dilli ke patpadganj main ho chuki he
 Alind says that we have to deliver books from door to door
 landmark or crossward jaise stores main public ke bich kitaaben laanch kerani hogi
 No stereo type, but modern and aggressive method will have to be adopted
 pranav ke mutabik raajapaal main pehle jahaan 80 fisadi hardbound or 20 fisadi paperbaque kitaaben hoti thim, vahiin ab 70 fisadi paperbaque or sirf 30 fisadi hardbound hai
 The biggest concern for Aditi Maheshwari is the aggressive marketing of cheap books
 bakaul aditi sirf acchhee kitaaben chhapana hi kaaphi nahin he, use logon tak pahunchaana bhi hoga
 Rahul Sharma (30 years) of Prakashan Sansthan, Piyush Kumar (34 years) of Prabhat Publications and Ankur Verma (35 years) of Diamond Pocket Books also consider marketing as the basic fund of business
 hindi ke in bade prakashkon ke alaava dehradun ke ek chote-se prakaashan nataraj publication kii divya aroda bhi apane khaas tareeke se hindi ke liye kaam kar rahi hai
 Divya, who has been nominated for the Young Publishing Entrepreneur Award at the 2009 London Book Fair, is working on bringing important environmental books in Hindi
 hindi main badlaav kii bayaar bah rahi he
 Those who curse modernity keep cursing, but the new generation knows that the biggest crisis in Hindi, from thought to behavior, is the lack of 'modernity'
 ab ve hindi ko modern bana rahe hai
 Shortly after the Janata Dal (united) split from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the BJP clarified that it would not back down from the decision to make Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi the party's campaign committee chairman for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 
 bijepi upaadhyaksh mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne kaha, 'bijepi apane aantarik nirnay swayan leti he

 Two days ago, a video of this Baba went viral
 jisamen wo ek skool teacher ke saath ashleel harakatein karata dikh rahaa he
 It is being told that this video was made to blackmail Charanjeet Singh and it was made viral when he did not receive the money

 The organization runs a number of schools and charitable hospitals along with social, religious functions

 It is alleged that Chief Khalsa Dewan Kamukhiasardar Charanjit Singh Chadha used to sexually abuse the teachers of the institution's schools in exchange for promoting them
 85 saal ke is jismkhor kii hakeekat se pardaa tab uthaa, jab uskaa ek video soshal media main viral hua
 In that video, he is seen doing lewd acts with a woman
 vah mahila ek teacher bataai ja rahi he
 It is seen in the video that he is also taking a selfie with the woman
 mahila bhi apane phone se baba ke saath selfi leti dikh rahi he
 Investigation has revealed that according to Manmarji, to get promotion, teachers had to do all this with their helplessness
 chif khalsa dewan sanstha ke sadsy nirmal singh thekedaar ke mutabik sanstha kaa ek ucch adhikari promoshan kii chahat rakhane vaali shikshikaaon ko ranjit singh chaddha se milwataa tha
 Instead of promotion, the teacher had to submit his body to Ranjit Singh Chadha

 The accused Chadha promoted this woman as the principal of one of his schools

 Chadha is absconding since the case was filed
 haryana ke gurmeet ram rahim kii tarah ranjit singh chaddha bhi apane raajnneetik rasookh kaa phayda uthaakar mahila adhyapikaon kaa shaareerik shoshan kar rahaa tha
 He is said to be close to former Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal
 akali dal ke kai bade netaaon se uske vyaktigat sambandh hai
 Due to his political reach, the police are still afraid to take action against him
 haalanki mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ne uski giraftaar ke aadesh die hai
 a video made in this way, then revealed in the open police investigation, that Ranjit Singh Chadha's work was captured by a camera by his hotel staff
 police sutron ke mutabik ranjit singh chaddha ke hotel main kaam kar rahe indrajit singh or uske chaar saathiyon ne milakar sisitivi camere kii madad se mahila adhyapika or chaddha kashleel videobanaya tha
 After making the video, these people blackmailed Chadha and recovered 1 lakh 20 thousand rupees from him
 iske baad unka laalach or bad gaya
 Due to which Indrajit and his companions again demanded five lakh rupees from Charanjeet
 magar chaddha ne is baar paise dene se inkaar kar diya
 Police later arrested Indrajeet and his associates on the complaint of Chaddha for blackmailing them, but were then released on bail
 police sutron kii maane to maamla darj hone ke baad indrajit or uske saathiyon ne hi charanjit singh chaddha or adhyapika kaa video soshal media par viral kar diya
 After the video went viral, Akal Takht set up an inquiry against Ranjit Singh Chaddha
 udhar, ranjit singh chaddha ke khilaaf ke shaareerik shoshan kaa maamla darj hone ke baad use chif khalsa dewan ke mukhiya ke pad se barkhaast kar diya gaya
 The Sikh religious organization Akal Takht has also summoned Chadha
 lekin mukadmaa darj hone ke baad se hi vah faraar he
 Now Akali Dal leaders are keeping silence on the matter because the party is getting into a grudge after a serious case against such a religious leader is exposed

 unke parivaar va sahyogiyon ke prati meri shok-samvednaaen — raashtrapati kovind— President of India (@rashtrapatibhvn)july 20, 2019 Our spinal cord carries the signs of itching to the brain
 yah shodhakartaaon ne pataa lagaaya he
 Reading a paper published in the Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials will help in better understanding of itching and find new medicines to treat chronic itching
 khujali jo praaia: eczema, madhumeh yaa kuch maamalon main cancer ke kaaran hoti he
 Professor Martin Goulding of the Salk Institute in California described, "the itchy sensation travels to the brain in a different way from the other sensations associated with touch, and the path passes through the spinal cord, a specific pathway
 "ab sirf 1 rupee main milegaa sanetary pad, in dukaanon par aaj se uplabdhshodhakartaaon ne pehle ridh kii haddi main nirodhatmak neurons kaa ek set khoja tha, jo koshikaon ke liye brake kii tarah kaam karte hai, jo khujali kii samvednaa ko mastishk tak pahunchane vaale ridh kii haddi ko adhikansh samay band rakhte hai
 These neurons produce the neurotransmitter neuropeptide y (NPY), creating a pathway for the sensation of itching to the brain, keeping the pathway always open in case of chronic itching
 Research: smartphone dimag ko bhi banaata he smart, dur rakhata he streuhon par kiye gaye prayog main paaya gaya ki in neurons kii gairmaujuudagi main unhen khujali kii samvednaa praapt nahin hoti he, lekin prayog ke dauraan jab dawaaiyon ke dose se in neurons kii sankhya ko dubaara badhaayaa gaya to ve lagaataar khujali kii samvednaa hasil karne lagi, yahaan tak ki unhen chhukar khujali nahin kii ja rahi thi, phir bhi unke mastishk ko yah sandesh mil rahaa tha ki khujali ho rahi he or vah vaisaa hi vyavhaar kar rahi thi

 However, mps from these political parties were absent in the Lok Sabha during voting on the proposal for amendment of the triple talaq bill

 Even if the government joins all its allies, the support of at least 35 more mps will be needed to get the bill passed
 ovaisi ne chah sanshodhan kii maang kii thithainin pramukh asaduddin ovaisi or congress ke kuch netaa bhi is bill par sanshodhan kii maang kar rahe hai

 bijepi ne aarope lagaaya ki arvind kejariwal or AAP kii soshal media team press ke madhyam se bijepi par 30 lakh voters kaa naam katwane kaa aarope laga rahi he, isse ye sabit hota he ki bijepi hi dilli main voters ke naam judwati he or vot katwati he
 The BJP said that this claim is directly a challenge to the Election Commission because the Election Commission and not the BJP does the work of adding and cutting the voters
 bijepi ne kaha ki aap baar-baar vot katwane ko lekar bijepi ko ghaseet rahi he
 BJP leaders have also submitted Arvind Kejriwal's tweets in the complaints submitted to the Election Commission
 agarwal samaaj ke dilli main total 8 lakh vot hai

 do maheene pehle dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke uparajyapal ke ghar dharne par baithne ke dauraan lagaai gayi sabhi yachikaaon kaa dilli hycourt ne nipataara kar diya he
 The High Court said that the strike has ended
 lihaaja is maamle main aage sunwaayee kii jarurat nahin he
 Although it was said on behalf of the petitioners that the strike may be over, but the court should pronounce its decision on whether the strike was constitutional or not so that the law and the court's stance are clear if such incidents recur
 kejariwal ke dharne se judi chaar yachikaayen dilli hoicourt main lagaai gai thim
 The court was also requested to decide what guidelines should be there in the petition

 The Delhi High Court said that if the Chief Minister sits on a dharna again, then the petitioners can move the court again
 court ne kaha, yun to dharne kshadhikaar sabhi nagarikonke paas he, lekin dilli hoicourt main yachika isliye lagaai gai thi ki dilli ke mukhyamantri hi apane mantriyon ke saath up-rajyapal ke ghar main dharne par baith gaye the
 If the Chief Minister does not sit on the dharna, then these petitions are also not filed in the court
 dharna khatm ho chukaa he to is par aage kii sunwaayee kii jarurat hamen nahin lagati
 In this case, Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi said, "we are not in favor of continuing such petitions on the lines of Congress
" dharna bhi khatm ho chukaa he
 Therefore, the court should decide whether the petitions need further hearing or not
 gauratlab he ki jin yachikaaon nekejarivalke dharne ke dauraan dilli hoicourt kaa rukh kiya tha
 He has also filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking the constitutionality of the dharna and making guidelines regarding this, but in July, the Supreme Court sent all these petitioners again to the High Court

 unhone mahilaon sahit police adhikariyon par hamale kiye or tab unhen kaabo or shant karne main sarkaar ke paseene chhot gaye the
 Anand Pal was seen as a Rajput response to Jat aggression and emerged right when OBC status was approved to the Jats and this caste community at the expense of Rajputs in panchayati raj and local bodies elections —or he believed so — had gained tremendous advantage

 Former Australian cricket captain Ian Chappell believes that India's Test captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has gone through his peak time and that it is the right time to make Virat Kohli a full-time captain in the five-day format
 bharat ke kaaryvahak captain kohli ne australia ke khilaaf pehle cricket test kii donon pariyon main shatak banaae or antim din lakshya kaa peechha karte hue shandaar pari kheli, lekin iske baavjood edilade main ballebaaji kram ke dhwast hone ke kaaran team ko 48 ran se haar jhelni padi
 Chappell wrote in his column on espncricinfo, Kohli's performance in the last three-and-a-half days will also make the selectors think that this is the right time to hand him full-time captaincy in Test cricket
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki test captain ke rup main mahendra singh dhoni kaa sheersh guzar chukaa he or aisa lagata he ki yah badlaav ke liye bilkul sahi samay he
 He wrote, Kohli, the caretaker captain of India but a potential full-time leader, needed physical strength for the innings and played brilliant shots even after being hit on the head

 On India's hopes at the London Olympics, Sports Minister Ajay Maken, while talking to NDTV India, said that this time the most players have qualified for the Olympics and it is expected that India will get more medals in the bag
 tennis team ko lekar hue vivaad par maakan ne saaf kaha ki kisi bhi khilaadi ko koi bhi bayaan dene se pehle desh ke bare main sochna chahie
 Question: For the first time, the Government of India has spent money on the preparation of the Olympic Games in a planned manner
 medal jeetne kii khilaadiyon kii kshamta kaa koi akalan kiya gaya he? Ajay Maken: 56 players qualified for the 2008 Beijing Olympics and this time 81 players have qualified for the London Olympics
 jo bhi khilaadi qualifi karata he, vah apane aap main vishwa str kaa hota he
 This is a big achievement
 khilaadiyon ne is baar kaaphi mehnat kii he
 a lot of money has also been spent on them
 unhen behtareen coach or duusari suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karai gai hai
 As a result, so many players have not qualified for any Olympic game till date
 mujhe ummid he ki hamaara pradarshan acha hoga
 Question: We had three medals at the Beijing Games
 is baar kitne padak kii ummid he? Maken: Increasing the number of medals is not very easy, but this time the number of qualifying players has increased from 56 to 81
 jaahir si baat he ki hamaari parformens is baar acchhee honi chahie
 But it all depends on how our players perform at that crucial moment
 meri najar main hamaare shooter, boxr, teerandaaj, pahalwaan, medal prospects hai
 Question: My com number is a boxer
 
 
 maakan : haa meri com se ummid he
 Deepika is Kumari
 bandminton kii dubles team acchhee he
 Saina Nehwal is also doing well
 sawaal : sina nehwal kaa aapane zikr kiya


jo khilaadi landan olympic jane vaale hai, unke pariwaron ko khel dekhne ke liye tikat or paas nahin die gaye
 a lot of players are disappointed because of this
 
 
 maakan : dekhiye, saare paas bhartiya olympic sangh (IOA) ke paas aate hai
 Our 10-member official team will go to London this time with seven former Olympians
 is delygation ke liye bhi tikat hamen IOA se maangana pad rahaa he
 IOA will give us tickets, then we will go there
 aisa nahin he ki sarkaar ko tikat milti he
 Those who are unaware of how the Olympics are organized, i want to tell them that the IOC is the ticket and pass to the IOA
 sawaal : jab bhi cricketer baahar jate hai, unka parivaar unke saath hota he


parivaar saath rahane se manobal badhata he khilaadiyon kaa
 
 
 Maken: Absolutely boosts morale, but to accommodate people in London, which are the criteria of the International Olympic Council, the capacity to stay in the Olympic Village, we will be able to send as many people
 hamaare jitne khilaadiyon ne kwalifai kiya he, uske anupaat main hi ye kota tay hota he
 This time our 81 players have qualified, then we can send other people with them in proportion to the same
 hamen ye tay karnaa hoga ki ham khilaadiyon ke parivaaravaalon ko bhejein yaa phir khilaadiyon ke coach doctor yaa physio ko
 If the coaches of the players do not accompany the team to the doctor or physio and only the family members go, what will be the performance of the players? 
 
 sawaal : jab bhi kisi bade antarrashtriya khelon kaa aayojan hota he, to sarkari delygation main adhikari zyada hote hai or khilaadi or coach kam
 
 
 Maken: This time we will have the biggest players delegation and the smallest officials team


 Last time, 166 people went to the official delegation in Beijing Olympics, while this time the government delegation will have only 10 people, including 10 former Olympians
 is baar hamaari 5−5 sadasyon vaali do sarkari timen alag−alag samay par landan jaaengi
 The comments sawaal : tennis kii team taiyaar karne ko lekar jo vivaad hua, bayaanbaji hui isaki vajah se jo maahaul bananaa chahie vah nahin ban paaya is baar


 Maken: You are right


 i have repeatedly said that players should think and play in the national interest
 aap jab bharat kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai, to khilaadiyon ko apane desh ke bare main sochna chahie
 They should think about this before making any rhetoric
 sawaal : pehali baar bharat sarkaar ne suniyojit tareeke se olympic khelon kii taiyaari par paisa kharch kiya he
 Is there any assessment of players' ability to win medals? ajay maakan : 2008 ke beijing olympic ke liye 56 khilaadiyon ne qualifi kiya tha or is baar 81 khilaadiyon ne landan olympic ke liye qualifi kiya he
 Whichever player qualifies is world class in itself
 yah bahut badi uplabdhi he
 The players have worked hard this time
 un par bahut paisa bhi kharch kiya gaya he
 They have been provided with excellent coaches and other facilities
 uskaa nateeja yah hua he ki aaj tak kisi olympic khel ke liye itane zyada khilaadiyon ne qualifi nahin kiya tha
 i hope we do well
 sawaal : beijing khelon main hamen teen padak mili the
 How many medals are expected this time? maakan : padakon kii sankhya badhanaa bahut aasaan nahin hota he, lekin is baar qualifi karne vaale khilaadiyon kii sankhya 56 se badhkar 81 ho gai he
 It is obvious that our performance should be good this time
 lekin yah sab is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki us mahatvapurn kshan main hamaare khilaadi kaisaa pradarshan karte hai
 In my view, we are shooter, boxer, archer, wrestler, medal prospect
 sawaal : meri com number ek boxr hai
 
 
 Maken: Yes, i do expect com
 deepika kumari he
 Bandminton's doubles team is good
 sina nehwal bhi acha pradarshan kar rahi he
 Question: You mentioned Saina Nehwal


 The players who are going to the London Olympics, their families were not given tickets and passes to watch the game
 is vajah se bahut saare khilaadi niraash hai
 
 
 Maken: See, all of them come to the Indian Olympic Association (IOA)
 hamaara jo 10-sadasyeey aadhikarik dal is baar landan jayega, usamen saat purv olympian honge
 We have to ask for tickets from IOA for this delegation as well
 IOA hamen tikat degi, to ham vahaan jaaenge
 It is not that the government gets a ticket
 jo anbhigya hai ki kis tarah olympic kaa aayojan hota he, unhen main bataanaa chahta hum ki jo IOC he vah IOA ko tikat or paas dete hai
 Question: Whenever cricketers go out, their family is with them


 Staying with family increases the morale of the players
 
 
 maakan : bilkul manobal badhata he, lekin landan main logon ko tehraane ke liye jo International Olympic Council ke maapdand hai, olympic village main tehraane kii jo capacity he, utane hi logon ko ham bhej paaenge
 This quota is decided according to the proportion of our players who have qualified
 is baar hamaare 81 players ne qualifi kiya he, to usee ke anupaat main ham-duusare logon ko unke saath bhej sakate hai
 We have to decide whether to send the players 'families or the players' coaches to the doctor or physio
 agar team ke saath khilaadiyon ke coach doctor yaa physio na jaaen or sirf parivaaravale jaaen, to khiladiyon kaa pradarshan behatar hoga kya
 
 
 Question: Whenever any big international games are held, the officials are more in the government delegation and less players and coaches
 
 
 maakan : is baar hamaara sabase bada khilaadiyon kaa delygation hoga or sabase choti adhikariyon kii team


pichhali baar beijing olympic main sarkari dailygation main 166 log gaye the, jabaki is baar sarkaar ke dailygation main sirf 10 log honge, jinamein 10 purv olympian shaamil hai
 This time our two government teams with 5–5 members will travel to London at different times
 tippaniyan Question: The controversy that took place about the preparation of the tennis team, the statement was made, because of which the atmosphere that should be created could not be created this time


 maakan : aapane sahi kaha


maine baar−baar kaha he ki khilaadiyon ko rashtrahit main sochakar khelnaa chahie
 When you represent India, the players should think about their country
 koi bhi bayaanbaji karne se pehle unhen is bare main sochna chahie
 Ajay Maken: 56 players qualified for the 2008 Beijing Olympics and this time 81 players have qualified for the London Olympics
 jo bhi khilaadi qualifi karata he, vah apane aap main vishwa str kaa hota he
 This is a big achievement
 khilaadiyon ne is baar kaaphi mehnat kii he
 a lot of money has also been spent on them
 unhen behtareen coach or duusari suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karai gai hai
 As a result, so many players have not qualified for any Olympic game till date
 mujhe ummid he ki hamaara pradarshan acha hoga
 Question: We had three medals at the Beijing Games
 is baar kitne padak kii ummid he? Maken: Increasing the number of medals is not very easy, but this time the number of qualifying players has increased from 56 to 81
 jaahir si baat he ki hamaari parformens is baar acchhee honi chahie
 But it all depends on how our players perform at that crucial moment
 meri najar main hamaare shooter, boxr, teerandaaj, pahalwaan, medal prospects hai
 Question: My com number is a boxer
 
 
 maakan : haa meri com se ummid he
 Deepika is Kumari
 bandminton kii dubles team acchhee he
 Saina Nehwal is also doing well
 sawaal : sina nehwal kaa aapane zikr kiya


jo khilaadi landan olympic jane vaale hai, unke pariwaron ko khel dekhne ke liye tikat or paas nahin die gaye
 a lot of players are disappointed because of this
 
 
 maakan : dekhiye, saare paas bhartiya olympic sangh (IOA) ke paas aate hai
 Our 10-member official team will go to London this time with seven former Olympians
 is delygation ke liye bhi tikat hamen IOA se maangana pad rahaa he
 IOA will give us tickets, then we will go there
 aisa nahin he ki sarkaar ko tikat milti he
 Those who are unaware of how the Olympics are organized, i want to tell them that the IOC is the ticket and pass to the IOA
 sawaal : jab bhi cricketer baahar jate hai, unka parivaar unke saath hota he


parivaar saath rahane se manobal badhata he khilaadiyon kaa
 
 
 Maken: Absolutely boosts morale, but to accommodate people in London, which are the criteria of the International Olympic Council, the capacity to stay in the Olympic Village, we will be able to send as many people
 hamaare jitne khilaadiyon ne kwalifai kiya he, uske anupaat main hi ye kota tay hota he
 This time our 81 players have qualified, then we can send other people with them in proportion to the same
 hamen ye tay karnaa hoga ki ham khilaadiyon ke parivaaravaalon ko bhejein yaa phir khilaadiyon ke coach doctor yaa physio ko
 If the coaches of the players do not accompany the team to the doctor or physio and only the family members go, what will be the performance of the players? 
 
 sawaal : jab bhi kisi bade antarrashtriya khelon kaa aayojan hota he, to sarkari delygation main adhikari zyada hote hai or khilaadi or coach kam
 
 
 Maken: This time we will have the biggest players delegation and the smallest officials team


 Last time, 166 people went to the official delegation in Beijing Olympics, while this time the government delegation will have only 10 people, including 10 former Olympians
 is baar hamaari 5−5 sadasyon vaali do sarkari timen alag−alag samay par landan jaaengi
 The comments sawaal : tennis kii team taiyaar karne ko lekar jo vivaad hua, bayaanbaji hui isaki vajah se jo maahaul bananaa chahie vah nahin ban paaya is baar


 Maken: You are right


 i have repeatedly said that players should think and play in the national interest
 aap jab bharat kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai, to khilaadiyon ko apane desh ke bare main sochna chahie
 They should think about this before making any rhetoric
 sawaal : beijing khelon main hamen teen padak mili the
 How many medals are expected this time? maakan : padakon kii sankhya badhanaa bahut aasaan nahin hota he, lekin is baar qualifi karne vaale khilaadiyon kii sankhya 56 se badhkar 81 ho gai he
 It is obvious that our performance should be good this time
 lekin yah sab is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki us mahatvapurn kshan main hamaare khilaadi kaisaa pradarshan karte hai
 In my view, we are shooter, boxer, archer, wrestler, medal prospect

 It was a normal day in the hospital as usual
 tabhi piya naam kii ek yuvati kuch bechaini or utsukata kaa bhav liye mere clinics main ai
 In panic, she was chewing on her lips lively
 usne mujhase sidhe poocha, ‘‘kya aap mujhe aisa bana sakate hai ki log mujhase baat karen
 "I was looking at him with astonishment that he clearly told," No one talks to me, except to talk about my nose
 ’’piya kaa cheharaa kaaphi khubasurat tha, lekin uski naak kuch nukili or lambii thi, jisaki vajah se logon kii najar sidhe uski naak par chali jaati thi
 He underwent a renaloplasty of his nose, after which his complaint went away
 usne mujhe tahedil se shukriya karte hue kaha, ‘‘aapane meri jindagi badal di
 “teenage young men and women are like caterpillars turning butterflies
 ekaek harek kii apni alag pahchaan ban jaati he or vah aakarshan kaa centre hoti he
 As a plastic surgeon, i have seen closely how far a person can fall victim to inferior gland due to its appearance
 isse uskaa aatmavishvaas kam hota he or uskaa swabhimaan khatm ho jaataa he
 This is particularly true of adolescent boys and girls
 aaj ke kishor pehle se zyada mahatvakankshi or sachet hai
 The growing demand for cosmetic surgery is evidence of this
 hamane dilli main collejon ke kareeb 500 chaatr-chaatraon kaa surveykshan kiya or sharir kii chhavi or cosmetic surgery ke prati unke ravaie kaa jayja liya
 The survey results were shocking
 60 fisadi se zyada uttardaataaon ne chaar muddon par ‘‘haa’’ main jawaab diyah 64 fisadi chaatr apane rup-rang ke kuch pahaluon ke bare main sajag the
 68 percent believed how their appearance affected their relationship with the opposite sex
 65 fisadi kaa kahana tha ki shaareerik vyaktitv naukari main safalataa ke liye jaruri tha or 80 fisadi ne kaha ki unke vyaktitv main chehre kii sundarataa sabase ahm he
 Have you considered why the face matters so much
 darasal yah hamaare vyaktitv kaa pratibimb he
 The world knows us by face
 isliye aashcharya kii baat nahin ki ham sabhi apane chehre ko pramukhataa dene kii har sambhav koshish karte hai
 According to our survey, more than half of the teenagers were beautifully impressed by some of the media compliments and aspired to be like them
 survey main yah baat bhi kaaphi rochak lagi ki khubasurat dikhne ke liye kishoron ne cosmetic surgery ko acha jariya mana
 About 42 per cent of the respondents said it was better and 70 per cent said that if people came to know about their cosmetic surgery then they would not feel any shame
 ham aasaani se in aankadon kii andekhi nahin kar sakate
 Most of us still consider cosmetic surgery a waste, and those who use it are "mentally unstable"
 mere clinics main bahut se yuvak apni naak maaikel jackson jaisi banavaane ke liye aate hai
 Although such people are rare
 ham jab unhen samajhate hai ki cosmetic surgery unka vyaktitv nahin badal sakati to ve aksar maan jate hai or kehete hai ki dusron kii nakal karne kii bajaae ve jis tarah achche dikhen, unhen vaisaa hi bana diya jaae

 After Sunday's meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh regarding his ministry's comments describing Chidambaram's role, Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said that the matter is under consideration and that he needs to understand its legal implications before speaking anything
 gyaat ho ki pradhanmantri se milane ke liye mukherjee washington main vishwa bank kii baithak main hissaa lene ke baad shanivaar der raat yahaan pahunche
 The meeting between the two leaders lasted for 45 minutes
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii tarah mukherjee ne bhi is baithak ke bare main kaha ki unhone apni america kii yatra or baithkon ke bare main manmohan singh ko jaankaree di
 Mukherjee told that a day after reaching Delhi, he will leave for Kolkata for Durga Puja
 mukherjee ne chidambaram ko apana mahatvapurn sahyogi bataate hue kaha ki vah kendriya vitt mantralay kii tippanee se sambandhit sabhi dastavejon ko dekhenge or tippanee ke kanoonee nihitarthon ko jaanane ke liye kendriya kanoon mantri se charchaa karenge
 It is noteworthy that Mukherjee refused to talk to reporters after arriving here from Washington
 mukherjee bhi neuyark ke usee hotel main tehre jahaan pradhanmantri apane shishtmandal ke saath ruke hue hai
 The Prime Minister on Saturday rejected the opposition's demand for Chidambaram's resignation in the 2G case
 unhone kaha, "sarkaar ke sabhi mantriyon main meraa vishwaas he
 "after the Prime Minister addressed the United Nations General Assembly, journalists questioned him on the 2G case as he walked out
 is par unhone kaha ki 2ji aavanton main chidambaram kii kathith sanliptata ko aadhaar banaakar unki sarkaar ke khilaaf vipaksh ke hamalon se ve pareshaan nahin hai
 He said, "why should i bother? It is the job of the opposition to criticize or condemn the government
" ve jo kar rahe hai usamen koi asaamaanya baat nahin he
 "at the same time, on Mukherjee's arrival in New York, the Prime Minister said that the Union Finance Minister is coming to give him information on global issues
 manmohan singh ne kaha, "vishwa main bahut sari ghatnaayen ho rahi hai
 The world is reeling from economic recession
 is silsile main vah mujhe avgat karana chahenge
 " pradhanmantri kaushal vikaas yojana pradhanmantri kii sabase mahatvakankshi yojanaon main se ek he lekin jab isaki padtaal kii to pataa chalaa ki kagaji khanaapurti or daftari aupchaariktaayen isamen palitha laga rahi hai
 This is the reason that out of 258 centers, only 15 centers are running where only 1000 youth are taking training
 vinod rajora bijepi yuva morcha se jude rahe hai or narendra modi se khaase prabhavit rahe hai
 Due to this, when the Prime Minister asked not to do the job but to give the job, he was impressed and left the job of HR manager in a company and opened the Prime Minister's Skill Development Center
 lekin kuch centaron main kamiyon or baar-baar inspection
 
 
 They had to close the center due to delays in job roll allotments
 buddha vihaar ke apane band pade centre ko dikhaate hue vinod kehete hai ki kareeb bees se tees lakh kaa saamaan band padaa he kyonki kiraaya dene ke liye unke paas paise nahin hai
 The same is true of center operators like Raju Manchanda
 daftari deree or choti trutiyon ke kaaran baar-baar ho rahe inspection ke chalate pachaas lakh kaa baari bharkam investment hone ke baad bhi ab tak centre shuru nahin ho paaya he
 In fact, due to the rigging of the first phase of the Prime Minister's Skill Development Scheme in 2015-16, many schemes are being implemented strictly in the second phase, the law of law
 saath hi isamen rajya sarkaron ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he
 It often takes months due to government sluggishness, which frustrates those who run a good scheme
 is yojana ke tahat sarkaar centre sanchaalkon ko 30 fisadi rakam chaatro ke daakhile ke baad 50 fisadi rakam course khatm hone ke baad or baaki bachi 20 fisadi rakam 70 fisadi trend chaatro ke placement ke baad di jaati he
 The National Skill Development Corporation is itself assuming that 94000 students have been trended since 2016, but only 51 per cent ie 47000 got the job
 haalanki centre sanchaalak is sankhya ko bhi zyada bataa rahe hai
 Center Director Rajesh Goyal says that due to the downturn in the market, there is a lot of difficulty in getting jobs to the trend students
 yahi vajah he ki kisi bhi centre ko bees fisadi rakam aaj tak nahin mili jo 70 fisadi trend chaatro ke placement par milani chahie
 On the other hand, the students who have trained are either given a job offer far away or they are reaching the Prime Minister's Skill Development Center to take a course from a new trade in the hope of a new job

 loksabhaa chunaav main uttar pradesh main sapa-basapa gathbandhan ko aapekshit safalataa nahin mili he
 The attempt of caste mobilization in 80 seats of these parties could not succeed
 jatiyon main banty in donon partiyon kaa har sameekaran dharaatal par naakaam sabit hua
 In this way, the myths of the caste equation of the SP-BSP alliance collapsed
 donon dal rajya main ho rahe parivartan ko samajhane main naakaam rahe
 They could not succeed in spreading their message to the people
 dalit, pichhadaa or muslim voton kii firaaq main hue is gathbandhan ke saare ganit dhwast ho gaye
 Not including Congress in the coalition has also been somewhat harmful
 congress ke utaare pratyaashee kisi-kisi seat par sapa basapa par baari padate dikhe
 He has proved to be a true voter for them
 lekin bijepi ke liye uttar pradesh main ladaai bilkul aasaan nahin thi
 After the by-elections in gorakhpur-phulpur and Kairana, the atmosphere was not in favor of BJP in Uttar Pradesh
 sapa-basapa or areeldy ke voton kaa ganit party par puri tarah se baari tha or sabhi chunavi visheshgy andaja laga rahe the ki bijepi ko 15 se 20 siton se zyada behad mushkil he
 The BJP was completely weak in arithmetic and the BJP leaders too were defeated in a way
 lekin is samay bijepi ke liye jeet kii guarantee ban chuke bijepi adhyakshmit shah ne bilkul haar maani or unhone ek baar phir usee formule par kaam karnaa shuru kar diya jiskaa istemaal saal 2014 ke loksabhaa or 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main kiya gaya tha
 This formula was 60–40
 uttar pradesh main yadav, muslim or jatav ko milakar 40 pratishat voter hai
 Apart from this, the remaining castes (including the upper castes) are 60 percent
 bijepi ko in 60 fisadi votaron par focus karnaa tha iske saath hi sabhi ko zyada se zyada poling booth tak pahunchaana tha
 But the big challenge before the BJP was that Savarna, one of its core voters, was angry with the SC / ST Amendment Act this time and Amit Shah was aware of this
 savarnon ko gusse ko kam karne ke liye modi sarkaar ne 10 fisadi aarakshan aarthik aadhaar par lagu karne kaa elaan kar diya
 After this, the saints and RSS workers associated with the Ram Janmabhoomi movement were given the responsibility to explain to the Savarnas
 gaiyr jatav jatiyaan jinaki sankhya pratishat main to kaaphi kam he lekin lagbhag har seat par vah thik thaak prabhaav rakhte he, ke kai chote-chote sammelan karaae gaye
 The effect of all this was that along with the upper castes, these castes also once again came into the bjp's court
 iske baad piem kisaan yojana ne bhi bada kaam dikhaaya or is yojana ke zyada labhaarthi inhen jatiyon ke hai
 However, the people who are associated with farming in the villages were very angry with the stray animals wandering on holiday, they were complaining that these animals are destroying their crops
 lekin aisa lagata he ki khate main piem kisaan nidhi kii raashi 2 hajaar pahunchate hi unki yah shikaayat dur hoti chali gai
 After this, PM Modi always talked about equality while addressing these castes
 isamen rashtriya suraksha kaa mudde ne bhi kaaphi asar kiya or oparation balakot ne bhi asar dikhaaya
 Apart from this, the Modi government also started talking directly to the beneficiaries who have got houses, toilets, gas cylinders and electricity facilities in the last five years
 iske alaava ayushmaan bharat yojana kaa bhi jor-shor se prachaar kiya gaya
 Some of these schemes were started to be implemented under special supervision before the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 jisaki dekharekh pradhanmantri karyaalay siem yogi adityanath sarkaar ke jariye kar rahaa tha
 The bjp's own machinery for implementing these schemes also worked fiercely and activists directly approached its beneficiaries
 bijepi apane 60 fisadi vaale votaron main yah massej dene main kaamyaab ho gai ki piem modi ek maatr aise netaa hai jo unka bhala kar sakate hai
 Apart from this, BJP strategists planned more than 25 rallies in Uttar Pradesh
 kul milakar bijepi ne piem modi ke chehre, apane coder, sarkari yojana kaa behatar prabandhan, rashtrawaad ke dam par sabhi samikarnon ko dhwast karte hue bijepi ne 62 siten jeetne main kaamyaab ho gai

 It is the lifeline of South Karnataka

 "they also justify arson in Tamil Nadu's number plate vehicles
 kaveri ke pani ke bantwaare kaa sawaal karnataka main aisi hi bhavanaaen bhadakaata he or siyaasi dal apane phaayde ke liye varshon se iskaa dohan kar rahe hai
 This issue has become a game between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to knock each other out
 is saal bhi aisa hi hua
 2016 has been a "water-tight" year for both states, as the catchment area of cauvery (kodagu district in Karnataka) received 33 per cent below average rainfall
 agast, 2016 ke khatm hone tak kaveri basin main jamaa pani kaa kul bhandaaran str (keares, kaabini, haarangi or hemawati baandhon main) 115 tiemasi foot tha, jabaki saamaanya taur par ausatan 216 tiemasi foot hota he
 According to the Cauvery Water Dispute Settlement Arbitration's ruling, Karnataka should release 193 TMC feet of water in the year when there is normal rainfall — 10 TMC feet in June, 34 TMC feet in July, 50 TMC feet in August, 40 TMC feet in September and 22 TMC Foot in October
 jab karnataka ne july or agast main jaruri pani nahin choda, tab tamilnadu ne iske khilaaf supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataya
 The court ruled in favor of Tamil Nadu (for the second time) and directed Karnataka to release 12,000 cusecs of water by 20 September
 phir kya tha, 12 sitambar ko rajya main virodh-pradarshnon or hinsa kii baadh aa gai
 Two people were killed in a confrontation with the police in Bengaluru and according to reports, more than 150 Tamil Nadu trains were vandalized and arson throughout Karnataka
 tamilbhashiyon ke kaarobaaron ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Chief Minister Siddaramaiah was inattentive, while his home minister
 parameshwaran kehete rahe ki ''halaat kaabo main" hai
 By late evening most parts of Bengaluru were burning
 tab kahin jaakar mukhyamantri ne suraksha halaat kaa jayja liya or 16 police thana kshetron main karfu laga diya gaya
 But by then it was late

 Independent MLA representing Karnataka State Ryot Sangh (an association of farmers) of Kamelukote in the same district
 es
 "this water dispute cannot be resolved in court," says Puttanaiah
 yah sarthak baatcheet se hi ho saktaa he
 The leaders of both the states should give their egos and devise a formula for water sharing in the years of scarcity
 " unke jaise kisaan maujuuda halaat ke liye karnataka or tamilnadu ke rajanetaaon ko doshi tehraate hai
 Hence, no more tightness formula has been derived for the last nine years
 kaveri panchat ne apana aakhri faisla 5 farvari, 2007 ko sunaaya tha, tab se ab tak koi sarvanumati nahin hui he ki monsoon kharaab rahane par pani kaa bantwaaraa kaise kiya jayega
 In these years of tangi, Kannada leaders like Vatal Nagaraja and Narayana Gowda, the founder of Karnataka Rakshana Vedike, get an opportunity to come out in front of the Kannada language and farmers on their own issues
 nagaraj do took kehete hai, ''jab karnataka ko pine ke pani kii jarurat ko puraa karne ke liye bhi paryaapt pani nahin he to hamen tamilnadu ke saath kaveri ke pani kaa bantwaaraa kyon karnaa chahie
 We will fight for Kaveri
 
 
 kaveri karnataka kii he
 "the problem in the Tangi years is also because the order of arbitration is not very clear about it -" In the year of Tangi when the water in the Cauvery basin is scarce, the allocated portion between Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry is the same
 Will be reduced in proportion
 " yah kaveri suparvijri cameti ke vivek par chhod diya gaya he ki vah donon rajyon kii jamini hakeekat kaa akalan karke tamilnadu ke liye chode jane vaale pani kii maatra tay kare
 However, the Cauvery Management Board could decide on the sharing of available water in the rainy years, based on the same type of formula as other river management boards in the country have adopted
 par na to karnataka or na hi tamilnadu ne is board ke gathan ke liye dabaav daalane kii koshish kii
 Karnataka certainly feels the scope for the formation of the Cauvery Management Board, but the problem is that all states have accepted the arbitration's final decision
 siddharamaiya kehete hai, ''ham sab chaahate hai ki yah mudda khatm ho
 
 
 But where is the National Water Policy? If we had such a policy in the country, we would not have to face such a huge problem
 " jaankaar maanate hai ki aage badaae kaa akelaa rasta yah he ki tangi ke varshon main jamini hakikaton kaa akalan kiya jaae
 Both states did not approve the final award of the tribunal and went to the Supreme Court
 karnataka kii apil par 18 aktubar ko sunwaayee hone vaali he
 Siddaramaiah says, "there are a lot of issues involved

 The 2G spectrum scam has become a mess for the Congress
 ghotaale main upie kii sahyogi party diemke ke mantriyon kaa naam saamne aane ke baad se upie sarkaar lagaataar vipaksh ke nishane par rahi he lekin e raja or kanimojhi ke jail jane ke baad congress ne sochaa ki is maamle ne uskaa peechha chhod diya
 But a finance ministry note spoiled the whole game
 vitt mantralay ke note main likhaa gaya tha ki agar tatkaaleen vittamantri pi chidambaram chaahate to 2ji spectrum aavanton ghotaalaa na hua hota
 Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee also acknowledged that his ministry sent such a note to the PMO
 uske baad sarkaar ke do varisht mantriyon pi chidambaram or pranab mukherjee ke bich manmutav or congress ke andar kii kalah khulkar saamne aa gai
 What is the dispute? a note was prepared on 15 March 2011 by the Finance Ministry regarding the 2G spectrum case
 isamen kaha gaya tha ki tatkaaleen vitt mantri (ab grih mantri) pi
 Chidambaram could have stopped the auction of 2G spectrum if he wanted
 yah note pradhanmantri karyaalay ko bheja gaya tha
 The opposition has been demanding Chidambaram's resignation since the matter came to light
 janata party ke adhyaksh subramanyam swami ne ucchtam nyaayalay main vitt mantralay ke is note ko saboot ke taur par pesh kiya he or maang kii he ki agar e raja doshi hai to phir chindbaram bhi utane hi doshi hai
 Since the controversy, Chidambaram has so far offered to resign 3 times
 kyon badi baat?2ji maamle main congress main chal rahi andruni kalah kii mukhya vajah vitt mantralai kaa vah note he jisamen kaha gaya he ki agar chindbaram ne jor diya hota to yah ghotaalaa nahin hua hota or sarkari khajaane ko itani baari kshati nahin hoti
 Chidambaram says why he was not shown this note, while Pranab Mukherjee on the other hand is firm on his stand
 mukherjee ne to buudhvaar ko piemo ko doosraa note bhejkar saaf kah diya ki piemo or kai mantralayon se vichaar-vimarsh ke baad vitt mantralay ne wo note taiyaar kiya tha, jisamen 2ji ghotaale main chidambaram kii bhoomika par ungali uthaai gai thi
 What is the situation? Amid the ruckus within the Congress in the 2G case, the current situation is that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress President Sonia Gandhi want to resolve the dispute as quickly as possible
 isi silsile main baithkon kaa daur lagaataar jari he
 Mukherjee has also described Chidambaram as an important ally
 haalanki chidambaram bahut hi zyada naaraaz hai or istife kii peshkash kar chuke hai
 Opposition's stance The Opposition has been consistently demanding the resignation of Home Minister p Chidambaram on the 2G issue
 haalanki pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne chidambaram kaa bachaav karte hue kaha he ki vipaksh jaldi chunaav karaane ko aatur he isliye wo sarkaar ko asthir karne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 BJP has said that Chidambaram is as guilty in the case as A

 He said, 'lalu Prasad's biggest mistake was to break the alliance with Congress during the last Lok Sabha elections
 ’ unhone is sambandh main zyada vivaran nahin diya lekin vah is faisle se bihar vidhansabha chunaavon main hone vaale pratikul prabhaav kii ashanka jataa rahe the

 But before the 2009 elections, the relations between the two parties soured and both decided to contest separately
 kaiyon kaa maananaa he ki is faisle se donon ko nuksaan hua
 Singh also objected to the decision to give 75 seats to the LJP in the assembly elections
 ‘lojpa ke paas yogya ummidavaar nahin hai or use 75 siten dekar unhone (lalu ne) unamem se kai siton par rajg kii sthiti majboot kar di he
 He said that due to this many qualified RJD candidates did not get the ticket, which could harm the party
 party ke upaadhyaksh or vaishali seat se paanch baar se saansad singh ne kaha, ‘kai muddon par mere lalu ke saath matbhed hai

 Raghupati is now on the Congress ticket
 singh ne kaha ki apane rishtedaar ko tikat nahin milane se vah aprasann nahin hai kyonki unhone unke tikat ke liye kabhi jor nahin diya
 Describing the reason for staying with Lalu, Singh said, "he (lalu) is representing the social movement and i am committed to this movement

 We have the proper techniques for the preservation of blood and take full precautions
 isamen laaparvaahee kii kahin koi baat nahin, jis laaparvaahee kii baat report main kahi gai he
 There is no technique that can save blood for more than 35 days
 ''rems kaa daawa he ki vah 4,000 unit prati maah ke hisaab se har saal takreeban 48,000 unit blad ikattha karata he
 In such a situation, there is no need to look at the reports of blood wastage

 Srivastava says, "it is not such a big waste to pull the line of worry on the forehead
" khun ko jarurat ke hisaab se diya jaataa he, jis marij ko jis blad group kii jarurat hogi, use ham vahi blad group denge na ki koi anya
 In such a situation, if the blood of a particular group is not used for 35 days, then it is bound to be ruined, in which we or you cannot do anything
 '' shrivastav yah daawa bhi karte hai ki bharat yaa vishwa ke kisi bhi aspataal ke blad bainkki tulana main rems main khun kii barbaad kii dar kaaphi kam he
 The report is enough to bolster the RIMS administration's muscle
 inamen khaas yah ki rakt sangrahan se pehle jaruri jaanch nahin karne se 488 unit rakt bekaar ho gaya
 That is, before the blood donation, the blood of the donor was not properly examined whether he has tuberculosis, HIV, syphilis, malaria
 shrivastav kehete hai, ''rakt ke ek namoonay kii jaanch main kam-se-kam dedh se do ghante kaa samay lagata he
 When you are running a blood donation camp, you cannot hold anyone for so many hours
 ham jharkhand ke kai hisson main niyamit rup se raktadan shivi chalaate hai, aisa karnaa sambhav nahin he
 We subsequently examine those blood samples and remove them if found infected
 '' tatkaal rakt pareekshan na karne ke peeche rems prashaasak nako ke disha-nirdeshon kaa bhi hawala dete hai lekin ye disha-nirdesh kya hai shaayad rems ko bhi pataa nahin
 On the other hand, an officer of the Jharkhand Accountant General's office said, "we do not know in which scientific language they are reducing the waste of blood
 ham to vahi kah rahe hai jo kagajaat rems ne hamen uplabdh karwaae, na ek unit kam na adhik
 We have given the report in your language, you should misunderstand it in your language
 aap sirf itnaa hi kar sakate hai
 Jharkhand, which has about 42 authorized blood banks, gets 1 every year
 90 lakh unit rakt kii kami se jujhna padataa he jabaki yah 1
 Can not collect more than 10 lakh units of blood

 Then why are they writing letters to the ministers? ”on 3 September Singhar accused Digvijay of 'blackmailing' the government and influencing policies through officers

 Punjab was the only state in five states from where bad news came for the BJP
 lekin kareeb se dekhen to is haar ke badal main bhi bijepi ke liye ek sunahari li chhipi he
 There was nothing to lose, the BJP did not have much expectations from Punjab
 ek dashak ke raaj ke baad pradesh main majboot satta-virdohi lahar thi
 Hence, the defeat of the Shiromani Akali dal-bjp alliance was considered certain before the elections
 saal 2012 main bijepi ko 7
 15 percent votes were received
 is baar party ko 5
 4 percent votes were received
 yani ye nahin kaha ja saktaa ki rajya main bijepi kaa supada saaf hua
 The k-factor turned out to be a well-known BJP strategist dealing with Congress
 lekin agar punjab main aam aadmi kii jhaadu chalati to party ko zyada dikkat hoti
 Arvind Kejriwal has plagued the BJP many times even in the shadow of the rights of the Center in a state like Delhi
 agar unhen ek adad pradesh kii satta milti to wo modi ke khilaaf or zyada aakraamak hote
 In such a case, the strength of the Aam Aadmi Party would also increase in the Rajya Sabha
 ye bijepi ke liye mushkilen badhaane vaale halaat hote
 Raha Sahajamodi's home state in Gujarat is one of the few states where the Aam Aadmi Party has been trying to make inroads for a long time
 bijepi ke netaa jaanate hai ki yahaan congress ke liye vaapasi behad kathin he
 But with the support of the Patidars, Kejriwal could emerge as a challenge in Gujarat
 magar in nateezon ke baad is baat kii puri sambhaavna he ki gujarat kii janata bhi ek baar phir modi mantra kaa jaap kare
 Kejriwal's challenge has weakened; In the current situation, there does not seem to be anything around Narendra Modi's model of politics
 lekin kejariwal ne satta main ek vikalp ke vaayade ke saath kadam rakhaa tha
 In a union territory like Delhi, the government has limited powers
 kejariwal kii shikaayat rahi he ki yahaan unhen apni nitiyaan lagu karne kaa mauka nahin diya gaya
 But Punjab is one of the important states of the country
 yahaan agar jeet milti to kejariwal 2019 main modi ke liye sabase badi chunautiyon main gine jate
 But now it is less likely

 In fact, as soon as the Lok Sabha proceedings started on Monday, the opposition parties raised the issue of West Bengal and accused the Modi government of misusing the CBI
 congress, samaajawaadee party, trinmul congress samet kai vipakshi dalon ne jab centre par aarope lagaae, to grih mantri rajnath singh sarkaar kii ore se jawaab dene ko khadey hue
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that CBI officials were prevented from conducting investigations by Kolkata Police

 CBI officials have been prevented from working, never before
 rajnath ne kaha ki desh kii kanoonee agenciyon ke bich aisa takaraav desh ke fedral or raajnneetik dhaanche ke liye thik nahin he
 He said that if agencies are prevented from working, then it will create chaos
 vipaksh ne modi sarkaar ko gheralokasabhaa or rajyasabha donon sadanon main hi sibiai vivaad ke kaaran hangaamaa hua
 Congress leader in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said that the central government wants to eliminate all opposition leaders by making the CBI a weapon
 unhone kaha ki jo bhi anyaay ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaata he, use dabaane kii koshish ho rahi he
 The BJO is misusing the CBI to increase its power
