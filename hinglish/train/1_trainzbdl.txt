 a Delhi court has made a shocking comment on the issue of premarital sex
 adaalat ne shaadi se pehle sex ko ‘aniatik’ or ‘har dharmik mat’ ke khilaaf bataaya he
 The court has said that every sexual relationship between two adults based on the promise of getting married cannot be considered a rape
 atirikt satr nyaayadhish virendra bhat ne yah bhi kaha ki koi mahila, visheshkar vayask, shikshit or karyaalay jane vaali ho, jo vivaah ke aashwaasan par sex karti he to aisa vah apane jokhim par karti he
 The judge said, 'in my opinion, every sex offense between two adults on the assurance of marriage does not happen if the boy later does not fulfill this promise
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘jab ek vayask, shikshit or offis jane vaali mahila vivaah karne ke aashwaasan par khud ko apane mitra yaa sahyogi ke prati yon sambandh banane ke liye samarpit karti he to vah aisa apane jokhim par karti he
 He should understand about this act and also know that there is no guarantee that the boy will fulfill his promise
 ’'ye aniatik hi nahin, balki prayek dharm ke niyamon ke bhi khilaaf'nyaayadhish ne kaha, ‘vah aisa kar bhi saktaa he or nahin bhi
 She should understand that she is indulging in an act which is not only immoral but also against the rules of every religion
 duniya kaa koi bhi dharm vivaah se pehle sex kii anumati nahin detaa he
 The court made this remark while acquitting this man working in a multinational company with rape charges
 maamla, jisaki sunwaayee kar rahaa tha courtpulice ne punjab nivasee 29 varshiya yuvak ko is mahila dwaara shikaayat darj karaane ke ek maheene baad giraftaar kiya tha
 This woman was doing administrative work in a private company
 mahila ne may 2011 main is yuvak ke khilaaf balaatkaar ke aarope main shikaayat darj karaayi thi
 The woman had alleged in her complaint that in July 2006 she came in contact with the youth through internet on the website and after this, the accused made several physical connections with her, promising to get married
 shikaayat ke anusaar jab 2008 main vah garbhvatee ho gayi to is yuvak ne usase vivaah karne kii bajaaye us par garbhpaat karaane kaa dabaav daalaa or kaha ki uski bahanon kii shaadi ho jane ke baad vah usase vivaah kar legaa
 The woman also told the police that she did not marry him despite her sisters being married
 isaki bajaay usne or uske mata pita ne use gaaliyaan deen or uskaa utpeedan kiya
 But the accused, during the trial of the case, opposed the woman's claim and said that they became friends through social networking and would meet occasionally thereafter but she never had sex with her
 'mahila ke paas nateezon ko jaanane kii samaj'adaalat ne is yuvak ke kathith kathan kaa sangyaan lete huye kaha ki mahila ke paas naitikta ko samajhane or uske krity ke nattejey ko samajhane kii budhimatta he
 Therefore, there is no possibility of misleading the young man by giving him any kind of trust
 'ladki hi kare achche bure pahalu par vichaar'adaalat ne kaha ki record main aisa koi saboot nahin he jisase yah pataa chale ki usne baad main shaadi karne ke vaayade ke aadhaar par hi sex ke liye sahmati di varanaa vah iske liye apni rajamandi nahin detii
 The judge said, 'I understand that it is not appropriate for a girl to engage in sex acts with a boy merely by saying that he is going to be her husband and indulge in sexual acts with her Neither is evil
 aisi paristhiti main ladki ko hi aise krity ke achche bure pahalu par vichaar karnaa hoga or phir use faisla karnaa chahie ki use apana sharir ladke ke hawaale karnaa chahie yaa nahin
 The court said that he himself is not satisfied with the victim's statement that she was misled on the promise of marriage and on the basis of this she gave consent to the young man for sex

 The election for Narendra Modi is nothing short of a battle, and the motive of his every move is to defeat the opponent
 modi apni tay yojana ke tahat matdaan ke din kii ore bad rahe hai vahiin virdohi khemaa pehle hi chhin-bhinn hota dikhaai dene laga he
 The challenge is tough for the Congress and Keshubhai Patel's Gujarat Parivartan Party (GPP)
 modi ne paramparaagat ranneeti kii andekhi karte hue apane 75 pratishat vidhayakon ko chunaav maidan main utaara he or ek bhi muslim ko party kaa tikat nahin diya he
 This is a well thought out move for him
 kisi bhi muslim ko tikat na dene kaa makasad vishwa hindu parishad (vihip) or jipipi kii chaal ko naakaam karnaa tha, kyonki vihip or jipipi modi ko hinduon ke saath dhokhaa karne vaale netaa ke rup main prachaarit kar rahi thim
 But Modi's strategy has raised questions over his goodwill campaign of last year, which he started to erase the image of his anti-muslim leader and projected himself as a prime ministerial candidate in 2014
 modi kii ore se karaae gaye ek nijee surveykshan main paaya gaya ki muslim samarthak abhiyaan se unhen chunaavon main nuksaan ho saktaa he
 His decision caused a lot of dissatisfaction among the minority leaders of the BJP, but Modi later convinced him
 modi ke kareebi ek bijepi netaa ne kaha, ‘‘modi agar musalamaanon ko tikat dete to vihip, jisane parade ke peeche jipipi se santh-ganth kar rakhi thi, unhen hindu-virdohi netaa ke taur par pesh karne ke liye ekadam taiyaar baithi thi
 In such a situation, the chief minister had to choose between the anti-hindu and anti-muslim labels
 unhone muslim-virdohi label kaa chunaav karnaa hi munasib samajha
 "this gave a boost to Modi's opponents
 samajasevi hanif lakadawala kaa kahana tha, ‘‘modi ne apana asli rang dikhaa diya he
 "apart from this, Modi's decision to give tickets to more than 75 percent of his 117 mlas and all ministers was no less shocking
 keshubhai patel kii yojana thi ki bijepi ke sambhavit asantusht netaaon ko phusalaakar apane saath mila liya jayega
 From the information received from the Vivekananda Yuva Vikas Yatra two months ago, the Chief Minister understood that the denial of tickets to existing mlas may prove more harmful for them
 unhen pataa tha ki is chunaav main ve vidhayakon ke naam par nahin balki apane naam par vot maang rahe hai
 This is clearly revealed by Modi's speech at an election meeting of Sanand near Ahmedabad
 unhone kaha, ‘‘pichley 11 varshon se maine gujarat ke khajaane ke chaukeedaar kii tarah kaam kiya he or janata ke paison ko upyogi vikaas ke kaam main lagaaya he, jiskaa phayda samaaj ke sabhi tabakon ko mila he
 The election results of Gujarat will give a new direction to the country
 vot dete samay mujhe dekhie, na ki party ke ummidavaaron ko
 "his manifesto appeals to the youth, women, farmers and the class that he calls 'the new middle class that has risen from poverty' due to economic benefits due to their development programs
" aadhuniktaavaadi hone kii apni chhavi ke anuroop hi unhone takneekee ko ek hathiyaar kii tarah istemaal kiya he
 The 3D election campaign is the first example in India's electoral history
 chunavi naaron main keval ek hi hero haih ve khud
 There is a slogan, "our captain Narendra Modi, who is yours?" Programs on Modi's election channel are run in Modi's name
 mahatvapurn baat he ki bijepi kaa kendriya netritv bhi jarurat ko bhaanpakar modi ke peeche ekajute ho gaya he
 It has currently put aside the issue of candidature for the post of Prime Minister
 disambar ke pehle hafte tak laalkrishna adwani, rajnath singh, sushamaa swaraj, nitin gadakari or arun jetali jaise do darjan kendriya netaa gujarat main 125 se zyada chunavi jansabha kar chuke hai
 On December 1, Sushma Swaraj made a statement that Modi has all the qualities to become Prime Minister
 unke is bayaan se modi ko kaaphi bal mila he
 Keshubhai Patel is said to be influential in the Luva Patel vote — 12 to 14 percent of the number
 bijepi ke liye sirf yahi ek atakalbaaji kaa bindu he
 Will Keshubhai divide BJP votes or will his non-patel castes come under Modi's camp due to his caste appeal? Luva Patel caste leader Naresh Patel has appealed to the Patel community to vote for the GPP or Congress
 lekin chunaav purv vibhinn surveykshanon se sanket miltaa he ki jipipi se bijepi ko koi khaas nuksaan nahin hone vaala he
 On the basis of caste, Patel should hardly go with GPP because the most benefit of Modi's development work is to the Patels, be it farmers or businessmen
 rajnatik vishleshak arvind bosamiya kehete hai, ‘‘keshubhai patel factor ko jarurat se zyada aanka ja rahaa he
 Modi is the only factor at this time
 ”tikat baantne kii prakriya shuru hone se pehle congress ne aakraamak rukh apanaaya tha, jabaki chunaav surveykshanon se spasht sanket mil rahaa tha ki is baar bhi modi achche bahumat se jeet hasil karenge
 The real reason for his stance was that the election of Gujarat could prove to be a 'live or die' battle for the post of Prime Minister in 2014 between Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi and Modi
 ek or jeet modi ko rashtriya str par congress ke yuvaraj rahul gandhi ke khilaaf ek diggaj virdohi ke taur par khadaa kar degi
 The unilateral ticket distribution may have eclipsed the Congress's prospects in the last phase, but Congress leaders are showing courage
 gujarat congress pramukh arjuna modhwadiya kehete hai, ‘‘gujarat kaa chunaav parinaam sabhi ko chaunkaa degaa
 "leader of the Opposition Shaktisinh Gohil says," Many people are not able to see the nuances which express the anger of the people inside against the misrule, corruption and dictatorship of the Narendra Modi government
 ” kai log unki is baat se asahmat honge, lekin bahut kam log is baat se inkaar kar sakate hai ki diggaj netaa shankarasingh waghela ke saath donon netaa modi ke khilaaf ekajute bane hue hai
 He has worked hard to oust Modi from power by running several programs for electorally powerful classes such as tribals and fishermen since mid-2011
 unke in prayaason ne bijepi ke ek varg main matbhed kaa maahaul taiyaar kar diya tha, lekin sitambar main modi ne vivekanand yuva vikaas yatra shuru karke is maahaul ko badal diya
 These two programs of the Congress that stirred the BJP camp were Ghar Nu Ghar (get Your Home), which had a plan to provide houses for poor urban women and 100 square yards plot for rural poor families, on which 30 a house will be built in the square yard
 pehla kaarykram agast main shuru kiya gaya, jisamen likhit rup se vaada kiya gaya tha ki congress agar satta main ai to kam keemat kaa makaan diya jayega
 About 30 lakh forms were filled for each program
 congress ke vidhayak paranjayaditya singh poochhate hai, ‘‘in kaaryakramon kii ghoshnaa ke baad mere nirvachan kshetra ke rajnatik kaaryakramon main behisaab bheed dekhi gai
 How can this enthusiasm be dismissed in the election? ”but Modi's BJP manifesto has promised to build 50 lakh new houses for the poor, so that this strategy of Congress can hardly prove effective
 vadhvaan vidhansabha seat se chunaav lard rahe congress netaa himanshu vyas kehete hai, ‘‘chaukas congress ne apni chunaav taiyaari main koi bhi mudda achoota nahin rahane diya he
 Our hard work will not go in vain
 ” darasal, mukhyamantri ke khilaaf party ke ‘disha badalo, dasha badalo” naare ne shuru main sachmuch apana asar dikhaaya tha, lekin modi ne apane prabhaav se use beasar kar diya
 The Congress had stepped up its campaign ahead of time, while Modi started campaigning at the right time
 modi ko sabase zyada phayda nirvachan kshetron ke parisemen se ho saktaa he
 It has 18 new urban seats and 22 semi-urban seats
 modi kaa prabhaav gaanvon kii apeksha shahari matadaataaon main zyada he

 Amidst the allegations that the Commonwealth Games were being organized, the government wrapped up the NDA rule and clarified that it had only two options to take Atavasuresh Kalmadi along with canceling the Commonwealth Games
 desh kii izzat kii khatir usne duusare vikalp ko chunaa
 Photo: Sports Minister Ajay Maken said in his statement in the Lok Sabha on his own statement that he was on the verge of being appointed as the head of the Organizing Committee of those Games
 It was signed by the NDA government
 jab aise kisi vishay par hastakshar kiya jaataa he, to isamen koi raajnneetik party nahin hoti he, balki bharat sarkaar hoti he
 However, Maken said in his statement, "in the original bid, the Chairman of the Executive Board of the Organizing Committee was made to appoint a government person and the Vice President of the Olympic Association of India (IOA)
 haalanki baad main adhyaksh ke rup main sarkari vyakti ke shabd ko hataa diya gaya
 Kalmadi was the president of the IOA at that time
 sadan main bayaan dene ke baad unhone baahar samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘hamaare paas do hi vikalp the, pehla rashtramandal khel ke aayojan ko radd karke desh ko duniya ke saamne sharmida hone dete
 The other would organize a game with Kalmadi
 hamane doosraa vikalp chunaa
 "the contract of the host city was signed by the Sports Secretary of the erstwhile Government of India and approved by the cabinet of the NDA Government, while ideally it was signed by the Secretary to the Government of the National Capital Region and the approval of its Cabinet," said Maken
 Should have been duniya main antarrashtriya khel pratiyogitaaon ke aayojan main aisa hi chalan he
 The same method has been adopted in the upcoming London Olympics
 ’’khel mantri ne tatkaaleen rajg shashan par aarope lagaaya ki us samay anubandh ke protocol kii thik dhang se jaanch parakh nahin kii gai or na hi praavdhaanon ke sambandh main koi vyavhaarya vikalpon kii talash kii gai or na hi suzav diya gaya
 He said the legally binding contract of the host city with the Commonwealth Games Confederation was signed on 13 November 2003 by Suresh Kalmadi, President of the IOA, Lieutenant Governor of Delhi and Minister of Youth and Sports
 maakan ne apane bayaan main kaha ki mejabaan shahar ke anubandh main kaha gaya ki aayojan samiti ko khel ke aayojan kaa kanoonee darja hoga
 However, on 1 November 2004, the IOA General Assembly elected Suresh Kalmadi as the chairman of the Commonwealth Games Organizing Committee
 isane kalmadi ko bharat sarkaar or rashtriya rajdhani kshetra kii sarkaar ke saath samanvay banane ko adhikrut kiya
 Maken said that the then Central Government should have induced the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi to sign the contract but it took the initiative on its own and issued a letter of support for organizing the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi and worried about the budgetary situation Without meeting the revenue and expenditure constraints, the Government of India jointly and separately agreed to all the commitments

 congress ne jahaan in aaropon se apana pallaa jhaad liya, vahiin bhaajapa ne is maamle main pradhanmantri se spashtikaran maanga he
 Maran is alleged to have misused his rights while serving as Telecom Minister and benefited his family owned Sun TV
 bhaajapa ke pravaktaa ravishankar prasad ne kaha, ‘pradhanmantri purv doorsanchaar mantri e raja ko nirdosh bataane kii galati pehle hi kar chuke hai, jo ab jail main hai
 The Prime Minister should now order an immediate inquiry into the case of the Malaysian company Maxis Group benefiting Sun TV Group without repeating that old mistake
 ’aarope he ki airsel main 74 pratishat anshadharak mexis kii ore se maaran bandhuon ke tivi main 600 karod rupye se adhik kaa nivesh kiya gaya
 Prasad said that under which circumstances, Maxis acquired Aircel in 2006 as telecom minister of Maran
 unhone kaha, yah aarope he ki maaran ne doorsanchaar mantri rahete airsel ke license or spectrum sambandhi aavednon ko manjuuri nahin di thi
 As a result, Aircel sold 74 percent of its shares to Maxis, close to Maran's family
 bhaajapa ne kaha ki maaran ko yah bataanaa chahie ki mexis ne unke san tivi main jo nivesh kiya, vah airsel ke 74 pratishat share kharidne se pehle kiya yaa baad main
 Prasad said if Maxis invested in Maran's family's TV, was it not a direct conflict of interest when he was a minister

 shanivaar shaam tak peedit bacchee jabalpur ke ek aspataal main ventilator par thi, jiske baad use behatar ilaaj ke liye air ambulance se nagpur le jaaya gaya
 a team of six doctors is treating him there, but his condition is still critical

 jab jharkhand ke mukhyamantri pichley swatantraaa diwas par apni sarkaar kii kamyaabiyon kaa jashn manaa rahe the, tab unhone elaan kiya tha ki 11 lakh 'jaali' rashan cardon ko radd karke unhone saarvajanik vitaran pranali (peedies) main karodon rupye kii bachat kii he
 Within six months of his grand announcement, 11-year-old Dalit girl Santoshi Kumari of Simdega lost her life due to hunger
 uske parivaar kaa rashan card usee abhiyaan main radd kar diya gaya tha jiskaa mukhyamantri jashn manaa rahe the
 The state government overcame any responsibility
 unhone daawa kiya ki uski maut malaria se hui thi (tab bhi jab unhone sthaneey rashan dealer ko nilambit kar diya tha or khaadya mahakme ke afasar par karrwai kii sifarish kii)
 Eventually, the government more or less accepted that the ration cards of Santoshi's family were among the canceled ration cards in that alleged 'savings'
 santoshi kii maut ke baad se jharkhand main bhukh se judi 13 or mautein ho chuki hai or kam se kam do odisha or do uttar pradesh main hui hai
 Earlier in Karnataka, three Dalit brothers died of hunger
 july ke aakhri dinon main do swatantra postmortem report se dilli main teen bahanon kii bhukh se maut hone kii tasdik hui
 The last time reports of such large scale hunger deaths came in 2001-02 - from Rajasthan, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh
 kuch tippaneekar ise saboot ke taur par pesh karke kah rahe hai ki kuch bhi nahin badla he or lagata he ki saamaajik suraksha kaaryakramon par 'sarkari kharch main ijaphe' ke baavjood logon kaa bhukh se maranaa jari he
 But those facts are wrong and this rationale is also flawed — the fact is that government spending has not increased (as a percentage of GDP) and yet things have improved
 jahaan saamaajik suraksha nitiyon ko lekar bhartiya rajyasatta kii naakaamiyon ko nazarandaaj kar paanaa mushkil he, vahiin badlaav laane main hamane jo duuri tay kii he, use andekha karnaa bhi beyimaani hogi
 How things have changed First, the number of families with access to PDS has increased significantly (from half to two-thirds of the population) over the past two decades
 duusare, peedies se 'licage' main kami ai he, khaskar sabase garib or bhrasht rajyon main
 Even in states such as Jharkhand and Odisha, where more than half of the grain was secretly transported to open markets in the early 2000s, most families get their share of grain every month
 yani pehle ke mukaable zyada logon ko peedies se zyada rashan mil rahaa he
 According to government data, the transfer of cheap PDS grains to poor families in 2009-10 resulted in a 'poverty gap' (distance between poor families who spend / who spend and the poverty line) by 20 per cent nationally
 Has happened
 tamilnadu or chhattisgarh jaise behatar pradarshan karne vaale rajya is antar ko 50 fisadi se zyada kam karne main safal rahe hai
 The same study shows that for every rupee transferred to PDS families, Government 2
 7 rupye kharch karti he, jisamen upabhokta ko di gai sabsidi ke alaava kisaanon se anaaj kii kharid par sarkari kharch or prashasnic laagat bhi shaamil he
 Perhaps it is time to forget that repeated statement of Rajiv Gandhi: Only 15 paisa of every rupee spent by the government reaches the people
 aise sudhaar peedies tak simit nahin hai
 According to estimates, the unscrupulous use of wages in the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) has drastically decreased since the introduction of direct bank payments in 2008-09
 vahiin kuch adhyayan bataate hai ki jin ilaakon main is kaarykram ko acchhee tarah lagu kiya gaya he, vahaan kai kism kii sampattiyon kaa nirmaan hua he jinke byore in adhyayanon main die gaye hai
 For example, wells have been dug, land leveling has increased agricultural land, rural connectivity and small projects to collect rainwater have proved beneficial for the economic and non-economic activities of rural areas
 sudhaar kaa ek or kshetra bacchon kii madad ke liye chal rahi yojanaayen harumid-de mile or anganwari
 There is also a considerable improvement in these from a long-term perspective of 20 years
 mid-de mile aaj puure desh main rosemara kii baat ho gaye hai, jabaki 2001 main us vakt isaki kalpana bhi nahin kii ja sakati thi jab supreme court ne pakaa hua khaanaa muhaiyaa nahin karwaane vaale rajyon par apana chaabuk chalaaya tha
 i was in Barmer in June 2012, when Rajasthan bowed to the Supreme Court's decree
 us vakt bachche lakdigaan binakar or pani khinchakar laa rahe the, shikshak khaanaa pakaa rahe the or yah 'mile'—namak yaa shakkar ke saath ublaa hua gehun yaa ghughari—bhi aisa nahin tha jiske bare main kuch likhaa ja sake
 During these years, the states have employed cooks and assistants and the central government has given funds to build kitchen sheds, install water pumps and buy utensils
 sabase ahm sudhaar khaane kii gunvattta main aayaa he—kuch halkon se virodh ke baavjood kai rajya ab bacchon ko andey muhaiyaa kar rahe hai
 In Indian context eggs are nothing short of superfood
 
 
 
 And how they did not, we must remember that these hunger-related deaths in the headlines are an extreme form of deprivation
 yah bhi sach he ki poshan ke nateezon par bharat kaa record kharaab he
 This indicates that 'hunger' is sustained in 2018 as well
 zyada se zyada mirch yaa aalu or patali panidaar daal ke saath uble hue chaaval kai saare pariwaron ke liye ab bhi roj kaa kul jamaa khaanaa he
 Worse, there is little room for these issues in the mainstream media
 vah yah bhi kar saktaa he ki 'bhukh se ek or maut' ko hataakar kisi pramukh siyaasi netaa kii mahaj dhyaan khinchne kii garaj se kahi gai bematlab baat ('kisi ne bandar ko insaan banate nahin dekha' yaa aisi hi koi baat) ko zyada tavajjo de
 There has been hardly any change in the media narrative about the programs being run with government help
 yah vahi puraani, bekaar, kshetreey purvaagrah se grast haalat he jo 1990 ke dashak main uttar bharat ke maidaanon main tari thi
 Despite the change, the mainstream media's broad belief is that the PDS remains' corrupt 'and' shasava ', the total deposit of NREGA means' digging and replenishing', still mid-day meal ' Teachers cook and it hinders studies
 'har kism kii sarkari madad ko bakawaas qaraar dena media kaa niojit khel bana hua he or bijness media kaa ravaiya to or bhi bura he
 His favorite — and easiest — tactic is to label the labels of 'bailout' and 'revdi' on all government assistance, and that every person who expresses concern about poverty is 'powertarian' —a challenge to curse those people Those who continue to thrive by poverty, hunger and undernourishment, allegedly thrive
 media ko kalyaan kaaryakramon kii kamiyon, khaamiyon, risaavon or duusari gadbaditon ko yakeenan saamne laana hi chahie, par use nishpaksh, santulit or sachhee tasviir pesh karne kii koshish bhi kerani chahie
 The media plays an important role in forming the opinion of those who have not had a direct connection with these programs and only by paying attention to the mistakes, a distorted picture is formed
 aaj chautarafa faile nirashaavadi or nuktachini ke maahaul ke peeche kuch vajah yah bhi he
 This pessimism weakens support for such programs, especially among those sections of society that provide vital resources — not only through contributions to taxes, but also through more broad-based support, which is critical to building political consensus
 is
 media kaa na badalane vaala yah ravaiya usamen kaam karne vaale logon ke varg or jati ke bare main, or korporate kii milkiyat vaali media kii naakaamiyon ke bare main bhi sawaal khadey karata he
 Constant attacks on these programs mean that political commitment towards them is half-hearted
 (hindustan main swasthya or shiksha par saarvajanik kharch up-sahaara africa deshon se bhi kam he)
 How public spending on these programs stalled during the last three government tenures (see: Effortless Government)
 yah bhi pataa chalata he ki hamaara saamaajik kharch bheeshan rup se kam he
 The way ahead It is worth repeating that the hunger deaths that we keep hearing about, despite being extremely tragic, are part of a larger and more complex issue
 zyada badi ladaai bajet main bahut kam rakam muhaiyaa karne or javabdehi nahin hone ke khilaaf he
 This fight does not make much headlines
 magar yah ladaai abhi hamen ladgai he
 Government support is essential for the lives of the weak and the resourceless
 kai rajyon ne saamaajik madad kii apni vyavasthaaon ko durust karne ke liye vaaki kadi mehnat kii he—yah unke maanav vikaas sanketakon main dikhaai detaa he
 The unfortunate effect of dismissing and insulting government aid programs in a jolt — and the 'bailout' and 'revdi' and 'powertarian' — has had the unfortunate effect of strangling public debate and discussion and bypassing issues Have gone which should be at the center of all our concerns
 garibi or bhukh se aazaadee ko samuhik jimmedaari ke taur par dekha janaa chahie, kyonki orvel ke lafjon main, ''yaa to ham sab bahut acchhee duniya main rahenge yaa koi bhi nahin rahegaa

 In this connection, Union Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Vijay Goel visited Chandni Chowk area on Wednesday
 unke saath mahayor aadesh gupta or standing cameti ke chairman vinaa viramani ne bhi hissaa liya

 Addressing the gathering, Vijay Goel said, "it is very important to completely stop illegal construction in this market, one has to see the danger of increasing market in cutters and streets
" sadakon kaa nirmaan bhi jaruri he
 For this, a mixed plan will have to be made
 ek athurity banane kii jarurat he
 Vijay Goyal also said that the development of the city is not possible only due to the banning of vehicles on the roads in Chandni Chowk, but will have to maintain 300 old corpses and buildings present here, while retaining their old form, as in Amritsar
 And has been done in Jaipur
 meyar aadesh gupta ne bhi is baat par jor diya ki chandani chowk ke puraane swaroop or heritage vailu ko barkaraar rakhana jaruri he or deveopment ke naam par vyapaariyon or yahaan rah rahe logon ko pareshaan karnaa sahi nahin he
 In fact, roads are being developed under the Chandni Chowk Development Plan and there is talk of closing the entry of trains and fixing the time of loading-unloading to prevent traffic jams

 He says that due to lack of parking around, people and 2 lakh traders here will face huge problems and customers will also be affected

 yah seat sipiem kaa garh rahi lekin philhal ol india trinmul congress ne is par kabja kar liya he
 In the elections of 1977 and 1980, CPM strongman Somnath Chatterjee was elected as an MP from here
 unhone sipiai or congress ai ke ummidavaaron ko haraaya tha lekin indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad desh main jo sahanubhuti lahar chali usamen somnath da apni seat bachaane main asafal rahe or congress kii ummidavaar mamata banerjee se 1984 main haar gaye
 Mamta Banerjee suddenly became the center of attraction after defeating a veteran leader like Somnath
 1989 ke chunaav main ekbar phir baaji palat gai or sipiem kii malini bhattacharya ne mamata banerjee ko haraa diya
 In 1996, the situation changed again and Krishna Bose of Congress was elected as MP while Malini Bhattacharya of CPM came in second place
 1998 main bhi krishna bose ko hi safalataa mili lekin is baar wo WBTC ke binar tale maidan main thim
 By 1999, Krishna Bose had joined the All India Trinamool Congress and was successful in reaching Parliament
 2004 main ekbar phir baaji palati or 3 baar se lagaataar jeet raheen krishna bose ko sipiem ke sujan chakrabarti ne haraa diya
 By 2009, the All India Trinamool Congress had become stronger and from here the party's Suman Kabir won and cpm's Sujan Chakraborty finished second
 is seat par voting kaa pattern kabhi aisa nahin rahaa ki kisi ek netaa par aankh moodakar bharosa kar liya jaae
 If Somnath Chatterjee won from Jadhavpur, he also had to face defeat from here
 somnath ko mamata banerjee ne haraaya to mamata banerjee ko bhi yaheen se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Voting will be held on May 19 under the seventh phase of voting in Jadavpur

 HIT a post shared by Siddharth Malhotra (@siddharthpmalhotra) on Mar 20, 2018 at 9:04pm PDT Senior BJP leader and former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is no longer among us
 kanoonee or siyaasi pahaluon ke jaankaar jetali sarkaar or sanghathan main galitayon sesikhkar use sudhaarney kii kala main bhi maahir the
 He used to narrate the anecdote in an informal conversation with journalists when the party's former national president Bangaru Lakshmana created a political scare as a video of a lakh of rupees being taken as payback
 is ghatana kebaad bhaajapa main bahutcharchaa hui ki yadi koi sanstha yaa vyakti party ko fund dena chahta he to kyasirf check se hi liya jaae
 Many people described this as the better option
 lekin sankatyah tha ki zyaadaatar sansthaaen cash main hi party ko fund dena chaahati thi
 In such a situation, Jaitley suggested that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and senior leader LK Advani Koyah that in any case, the National President or Parliamentary Board (which has the senior most party leaders) do not take cash, check or any other way, party funds
 
 yah suzav sabhi ko pasandaaya or party main ek system ban gaya ki fund lene ke liye alag koi vyakti niyuktakiya jaae
 After this incident, Jaitley also decided for himself and his family that the transaction should be done through check only
 iskaa paalan unhone itani sakhti se kiya kiapane bete or beti ko jeb kharch bhi vah check se hi dete the
 He used to pay only to those who worked here
 ek baar jab un par 2009 main yah aarope lagayagaya ki unke parivaar ko ek vivaadit vyakti ne gift diya he to usase kaaphi siyasibavaal machaa
 Later, when Jaitley was told that it was not a gift but was bought by his family members, Jaitley's opponents alleged that what was the proof of money given to buy, then Jaitley was told that the cash payment Not from the check, which is in their bank details
 iske baad maamlashanth pad gaya
 He also used to encourage the party people that even small transactions with small checks are safe in every way
 *** Just before the elections in Rajasthan, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party remembers the state's 'babosa'
 rajputon kii naaraazgi or jaswant singh ke bete maanavendra singh ke congress main jane ke baad ajabijepidesh ke uparashtrapatibhiron singh shekhawatki shradhanjali sabha yojit kar rahi he
 Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, who was the Chief Minister of Rajasthan, was born in Sikar on 23 October
 is maukey par aaj shaam paanch baje jaipur ke vidyadhar nagar main bhairon singh shekhavat ke samadhi par shradhanjali sabha rakhi gai he, jisamen mukhyamantrivasundhararaaje samet aadha darjan kendriya mantrimandal or bijepi ke rajasthan ke aalaa netaa bhaag lenge
 Vasundhara has ignored Shekhawat? It is noteworthy that Congress General Secretary and former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gahlotgalatar has been accusing Vasundhara Raje of neglecting Bhairon Singh Shekhawat
 itnaa hi nahin raajnneeti main unki beijjati ke bhi gahalot ne aarope lagaae or yahaan tak kaha kii marane ke baad bhi bijepi ne unako bhula diyaalekin ab jabaki disambar main rajasthan main chunaav hone ja rahe hai, bijepi ek baar phir bhairon singh shekhavat ke jariye rajput voton main send lagane kii yojana bana rahi he
 Today's tribute meeting is viewed from the same perspective
 haalanki yah sach he ki isse pehle bijepi netaa laalkrishna adwani, venkaiya naidu jaise kendriya netaa bhairon singh shekhavat kii shradhanjali sabha main jate rahe hai lekin rajasthan ke bijepi netaa isse duuri banaae rakhte the
 After the death of Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, the then Chief Minister of Rajasthan, Ashok Gehlot, gave land to build his tomb
 ab bhairon singh shekhavat ke naam par vot batorne kii jugat main unka parivaar bhi laga hua he
 Shekhawat's son-in-law and former state minister MLA Narpat Singh Rajvi has a figure of 36 from Vasundhara Raje
 vasundhara raaje ne is baar unako mantri bhi nahin banaaya tha or vah gaahe bagaahe vasundhara raaje kaa virodh karte rahe, lekin is baar vah khud ke alaava apane bete abhimanyu singh rajvi ke liye bhi bijepi se tikat chaahate hai
 Hence Abhimanyu Singh Rajvi is organizing a tribute meeting of Bhairon Singh Shekhawat in memory of his maternal grandfather
 mana jaataa he ki bhairon singh shekhavat kii vajah se hi rajasthan main rajput bijepi ke paramparaagat voter rahe hai or rajasthan kii rajya main bhairon singh shekhavat kaa ek kaddavar kad rahaa he
 Bhairon Singh Shekhawat had been the face of BJP and Jana Sangh in Rajasthan for almost five decades, but after Vasundhara Raje's entry into Rajasthan politics, he went on playing humor
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii adhyakshata main cabinet ne somvaar ko motor vaahan sanshodhan vidheyak ko manjuuri di
 In which there is a provision for heavy penalty for violation of traffic rules
 ambulance aadi apatkaaleen vaahanon ko rasta na dene, ayogy tehraae jane ke baavjood gaadi chalaane par das hajaar rupee kaa jurmaana lagegaa
 Violations of driving license terms by groups such as Ola, Uber will entail heavy penalties of Rs 1 lakh
 adhik raftaar se gaadi chalaane par ab ek hajaar rupee kii jagah do hajaar rupee chukaane pad sakate hai
 Strict provisions have been made in the bill to ensure that people walk on the road carefully
 bill me prastaavit nae niyamon ke mutabik, bina insurance ke driving par do hajaar rupee, bina helmet ke gaadi chalaane par ek hajaar rupee jurmaana or teen maheene ke liye license nilambit ho saktaa he
 Parents will have to run a vehicle from a minor, the motor vehicle bill passed by the Kaidmodi government has shown strictness on driving a minor's vehicle
 naaballig se vaahan chalavane par abhibhavakon kii gaadi kaa na keval registration radd hoga, balki doshi sabit hone par 25 hajaar rupee jurmaana or teen saal kii kaid hogi
 Now for violating the orders of the authorities, a fine of two thousand rupees will be imposed instead of five hundred rupees
 bina license ke vaahan chalaane par paanch hajaar rupee jurmaana lagane kaa prastaav he
 Similarly, the amount of fine for driving dangerously has also been increased to one thousand rupees
 jabaki sharaab pikar gaadi chalaane par das hajaar rupee kaa motaa jurmaana lagegaa
 There is a system of 20 thousand fine for overloading
 agar aap seat belt nahin lagaate hai to ek hajaar rupee jurmaana lagegaa
 Not wearing a helmet will attract a thousand fine and the license may be suspended for three months
 bahujan samaaj party or samaajawaadee party ke gathbandhan ke baad congress ne priyanka gandhi wadra ko purvi upi kii jimmedaari saunpte hue mahasachiv banaaya tha

 In this, Rae Bareli and Amethi seats were left for Congress, while two seats were left for other allies
 iske baad areldi gathbandhan main shaamil ho gai, shuruyaat main paanch siton kii chaah rakhane vaali areldi ko teen siten milin
 The SP has given a seat to the RLD from its account
 rashtriya lokdal ko pashchimi upi kii mathura, mujffarnagar or bagpat seat mili he
 In the alliance between SP and BSP, the RLD had been trying to get at least five seats from the beginning
 shuru main areldi ne sapa-basapa gathbandhan se 5 siton kii maang kii thi, jabaki sapa-basapa gathbandhan shuru se hi areldi ko teen siten dene ko taiyaar tha
 The RLD had demanded these five seats - Hathras, Kairana, Baghpat, Muzaffarnagar and Kairana
 haalanki, use mahaj teen siton par hi santosh karnaa padaa
 Let me tell you, in January this year, the SP-BSP refused to take the Congress along with them in alliance in UP
 us dauraan sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav or basapa pramukh mayawati ne saajha press conference main kaha tha ki hamen aisa lagata he ki congress ke saath gathbandhan karne se unhen siton kaa nuksaan hoga
 The bua-babua pair not only gave a jolt to the Congress, which was involved in the grand alliance exercises
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan main congress ko saath na rakhane par mayawati ne kaha tha ki bijepi kii tarah hi congress kii nitiyaan bhi bhrasht hai
 Corruption took place during the reigns of both BJP and Congress
 congress or bijepi donon kii niti ek jaisi hi bhrasht he or kagress ke saath jane par basapa ko vot share main nuksaan hota he
 Let us tell you that on November 10, a big religious event was organized under the Sarbat Khalsa of Sikhs in Amritsar, whose main convenors were Simranjit Singh Mann and Mohkam Singh

 Not only his fans but crores of Indian cricket fans have also started to question whether Yuvi is now running out of Team India and running this year and not taking part in Ranji Trophy 2017-18 session Will the Indians ever be able to return in odis or T20s in future? Will he be able to fit into BCCI and captain Virat Kohli's future plans? By the way, if these questions are arising, then they cannot be ignored because on Tuesday, Yuvraj turned 36 years old

 Edited excerpts: Have you taken the issue of privatization of Air India seriously or is it just a shigufa? That question also arose when the cabinet passed a turnaround plan
 bahut logon kii sahmati thi ki ise nijee haathon main de den
 Then it also arose that the situation of Air India was not such that any private company would invest in it
 karmchaariyon ko chah-chah maheene se selary nahin mili thi
 The merger that took place in 2007 was named Merger
 management-varkar relationships itani kharaab thi saal main do baar strike hoti thi
 Air India was not in a position to fund the airport and oil companies
 kai baar to aisa hua ki plane main paisanger baithe hai or oil company paisa dene se manaa kar rahi he, kyonki inhone chah maheene se paisa nahin diya he
 The amazing thing was that the call center of Air India was run by another airline company
 in halaat main nijeekaran hi aapako ekmaatr vikalp najar aata he?sarkaar ke liye sarvice industry chalaa paanaa bahut mushkil he
 It is very competitive, very capital intensive
 compatitive rahane ke liye aap ko bahut teji se faisle karne hote hai
 Now in any government institution, the decision committees, the file goes from top to bottom and many procedures are done
 lekin agar aap is tarah ke bijness main hai to aap ko bahut teji se faisle lene honge
 Everything in the service industry depends on your customer
 chunki aap sarkari naukari main hai, isliye aap kaa atitude customer ke saath vaisaa nahin hota jaisaa privet company ke karmchaaree kaa hona chahie
 Government employees have another problem - many employees are undesirable (undesirable) and unqualified (unqualified), you cannot remove them
 koi air india ko kyon kharide?air india ke paas duniyabar main landing spot hai, unke root difind hai, unke paas apni property he
 There are good pilots and cabin crew
 baaki airlines ke paas lij ke vimaan hote hai, air india ke paas apane vimaan hai
 If Air India is given in private hands, then the money spent on Air India can be used for other purposes
 is paise ko sarkaar food sicurity or aise hi anya kaamon main laga sakati he
 But only six months are left for the government, how will you be able to do this work? This government has only six months left
 agar aapako itani badi company ko jisaki sampattiyaan duniyabar main faili hai, use privetise karnaa he to sabase pehle aapako uske esets kaa veluation karana hoga
 i am not saying that i am doing this or this government is doing this, i am just saying that in the long term any government will have to privatize Air India
 aap or paisa is airlines main nahin laga sakate
 Who is to blame for delivering Air India in this condition? The planes we bought earlier are at very high interest rates
 air india ke paas koi equity nahin he, hamaara date equity reshio bahut kharaab tha
 Banks are not giving loans to anyone in aviation, we have to take sovereign guarantee only then the loan is available
 tab bhi karj 11-12 fisadi byaaj kii dar se miltaa he
 When they turned out from outside to take a loan at three to four percent in dollars, no one gave it, everyone said, bring a sovereign guarantee
 chijen galat huin tabhi to ye halaat saamne aae
 Now i cannot tell what scams have happened here
 lekin koi privet player hota to nae plane nahin kharidta
 If you privatize, how will you remove the worries of the employees? As much as the airport has been privatized, jobs have been protected
 air india ke idi or siemdi se zyada selleri unke driver kii he
 3,000 crore annually
 kaa he
 Can not such changes be made in the management till the privatization that the company can work better? Can there be such decisions in the government? What are you talking about? Can i hire an employee? Can you tell me what is the middle way? If there are any problems in the country, then government airlines are useful
 sarkaar jab chaahe privet airlines se vimaan le sakati he or jin deshon main sarkari airlines nahin he, ve bhi to aapadaa se nibatate hai
 Last question, will there be anything in the direction of privatization eventually or not? There is a similar work in any field
 discshan se maahaul banataa he
 If the discussion has started on privatization today, it will also take place tomorrow (privatization)

 " himachal ke mukhyamantri virbhadra singh apni shakhsiyat ke liye jane jate rahe hai
 a few months ago, he clearly told all Congress leaders including Congress President Sonia Gandhi that state President Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu should be removed
 iske baad vivaad sonia-rahul ke daftar tak pahunchaa
 According to sources, during his meeting with Rahul Gandhi, Virbhadra Singh made it clear that state president Sukhu was also made the chairman of the campaign committee on October 13, it is not acceptable
 isiilie dopaher 12:30 baje sukkhu virbhadra or prabharee scindia kii congress mukhyalay main hone vaali press conference radd kar di gai
 Veerbhadra remained adamant on his demand, and the whole day kept going
 congress ne press conference cancil kar di, jiske baad der shaam 6:00 baje virbhadra singh press conference karne aae
 Soon after that, the Congress made it clear that the chairman of the campaign committee would no longer be Sukhu but Virbhadra Singh
 kul milakar congress alaakaman or virbhadra singh ke bich deal final hui ki, sukkhu pradesh adhyaksh to bane rahenge lekin baaki maamalon main virbhadra hi vahi role adaa karenge jo captain amarinder singh ne punjab main kiya
 After this whole matter, the Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh Virbhadra Singh had a special conversation from today
 vikaswad or vanshavadavirbhadra singh ne kaha ki ye bekaar kii baat he
 Criteria should not be dynastic, serve the public and vote of the public
 agar meraa betaa yaa beti janata kii seva karata he, janata usko vot dekar chunati he to phir vanshavaad kahaan? main khud 6 baar himachal kaa mukhyamantri rahaa hum
 In such a situation, will i also be accused of dynasty
 'nehru patel or gujarat ko pasand nahin karte the'himachal ke mukhyamantri ne kaha ki modi jhooth bol rahe hai
 i belong to the era of Nehru
 modi jhooth bol rahe hai
 The time they are talking about
 vah jamaana nehru patel kaa tha, tab shaayad modi paidaa bhi nahin hue the yaa phir primary skool main pard rahe the
 i have read all the books of history
 us vakt ke tamaam netaaon se baatcheet kii he
 The matter of quarrel between Nehru and Patel is meaningless
 donon ek duusare ko bharpoor sammaan dete the
 'PM Modi is breaking the limits of Tamizh', Virbhadra clearly said that the latest speeches and statements of PM Modi are such that do not suit a Prime Minister
 main to yahi kahuunga pradhanmantri tameez kii had tod rahe hai
 'case of disproportionate assets, conspiracy against me', on his allegations of disproportionate assets, Virbhadra Singh tearfully said that Central agencies are being misused against me, but i am not that person Sit down and calm down main apni eemaandaaree or sachai sabit karne ke liye ladata rahoonga
 i am fighting mujhe pareshaan karne ke liye lagaataar kendriya agenciyon kaa beja istemaal kiya ja rahaa he, lekin main virbhadra singh hum
 Not one to run away from fear, a competitor
 vikaas par kisi bhi manch par bahes kar len PM modivirbhadra singh ne kaha ki aaj main piem modi se sirf itnaa kahana chahta hum ki vah aaen or vikaas par mujh se bahes karen
 'is this a challenge? 
 
 ' ke sawaal par virbhadra bole ki main haath jodakar vinamrata se kahata hum
 It is not a challenge, but at least argue
 aaj kii arthvyavastha bataa rahi he ki desh va pradesh kisaan ho yaa noujvaan sabhi pareshaan hai
 He said that compare the 3 years of the Modi government with the UPA, there is an outcry everywhere
 isliye phir main virbhadra singh pradhanmantri modi se kahata hum ki aapkaa puraa sammaan he
 You are big main chota hum
 But don't turn things around, argue for development
 sukkhu or campan cameti parcongress campan cameti ke nae chairman bane virbhadra singh ne kaha ki jo hua vah ateet kii baat he
 Significantly, Virbhadra Singh has been continuously demanding the removal of Sukhu from the post of state president and has written to Sonia and Rahul
 lekin sonia rahul maane nahin, bich kaa rasta hi niklaa ki campan cameti ke chairman pad se sukkhu ko hataakar virbhadra singh kii tajposhi kar di gai
 Overall the story is straightforward
 himachal main punjab jaisi jeet kii ummidapunjab main amarinder ko kaman saunpane vaali congress himachal main virbhadra ko kaman saunp chuki he
 Expect exactly the same win
 lekin alaakaman ne yah bataa diya he ki vah jhukegaa, lekin ek seemaa tak isliye alaakaman ne tay kar diya he ki himachal congress ke pradesh adhyaksh pad ke pad par sukkhu par bane rahenge

 - input language jab aap naukari karne jate hai to aapke kai dost, saathi bhi banate hai or unamem kuch saath aapke kareeb hote he, jinase aap bahut zyada baaten karte hai
 It is necessary to have good relations with colleagues in office, but keep in mind that some things should not be shared
 aaj ham aapako bataane ja rahe hai ki kuch aisi baaten hai, jo aapako kabhi bhi apane saathi ko nahin bataani chahie
 Problems about the company - Every employee has some complaints about his work and try to resolve it by meeting his colleagues
 vahiin kabhi bhi kaam ko lekar apane saathiyon ko baar-baar naa bataaen or adhikariyon se milakar hal nikaal len
 TIPS: Avoid making these mistakes after getting promoted
 
 
 duusare saathiyon kii buraai-agar aapako kisi saathi se dikkat he to apane senior se isaki baat karen
 If you have any problem with him personally then talk to him only
 kabhi bhi duusare saathi ke baaren main anya saathi ko naa bataaen
 Because in future it can also cause trouble for you
 nijee baaten naa karen share-offis main bhale hi aapke khaas mitra hai, lekin apni nijee baaten share naa karen
 Whenever you do this, the partner can take advantage of your personal things
 rejume main in baton kaa rakhen dhyaan, nahin to ho sakate hai riject!bos kii naa karen buraai-bos se har karmchaaree ko koi naa koi dikkat hoti he
 So if there is any problem then do not talk to any other employee this time
 kabhi kabhi aisi baaten aapke liye dikkat paidaa kar sakati hai
 Earnings and expenses: Even though every company refuses to tell their employees to pay each other, but often people come to know this
 phir bhi khulkar apni selary yaa kamai par charchaa karne kii jarurat nahin he

 sthaneey logon kii maang thi ki gurmeet ram rahim singh ko parole na di jaae
 After this Ram Rahim Singh unconditionally withdrew his parole petition
 bataaya jaataa he ki parole yachika khaarij hone ke dar se gurmeet ram rahim singh ke vakeelon ne yachika waapas le lee thi, kyonki agar yachika lau and order kharaab hone kii ashanka main parole yachika khaarij kii jaati, to bhavishya main bhi gurmeet ram rahim singh ko parole lene main dikkat aa sakati thi
 Explain that Dera chief Gurmeet Singh is convicted in the case of sexual exploitation and murder by the CBI court

 aapako bataa den ki pichley saal saudi arab ke ek jaj ne kaha tha ki agar kisi mahila ko apane pati kii cigarette se pareshaani hoti he to wo talaak ke liye apil daayar kar sakati he
 At the same time, in October 2012, the judge said that if it is proved that one of the parents or both of them smokes cigarettes, then they can lose the custody of their children
