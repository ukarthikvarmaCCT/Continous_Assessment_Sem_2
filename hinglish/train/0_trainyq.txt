 notebandi ke 50 din puure ho gaye hai or 30 disambar kii dedline khatm hone kaa countdown shuru ho chukaa he
 In such a case, Aaj Tak has conducted a special investigation in Delhi
 padtaal ke jariye ye jaanane kii koshish kii aakhir 50 dinon main bharat kitna cashles ho sakaa he
 On November 8, during the announcement to introduce demonetisation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that demonetisation will eliminate black money
 din bitne ke saath bayaan badalte gaye or aaj sarkaar ne notebandi ko cashles arthvyavastha se jod diya he
 The investigation of this cashless system was started from Lodhi Road area of delhi
 ilaake main zyaadaatar aabaadi centre sarkaar ke karmchaariyon kii hi he
 Middle and upper-middle class multiplicity Many shops in this area have started facilities like POS machines and Paytm, adopting cashless system
 lodhi colony ke khanna market main kiraanaa store chalaane vaale raaj gulati ilaake ke zyaadaatar logon ko rashan or ghar ke jaruri saamaan muhaiyaa karaate hai
 Raj Gulati already has a card swipe machine but its use has increased after demonetisation
 inke mutabik cash kii kami ke chalate logon ne debit card or duusare madhyamon kaa istemaal shuru kar diya he
 Raj Gulati also takes payment from his customers through checks instead of goods, but they certainly believe that their business has been affected after the demonetisation but they hope that the situation will be rectified soon
 khanna market main hi sabji kii dukaan lagane vaale ramkishan kii maane to notebandi se unki dukandaaree kii qamar bhi tut gai he
 There is no system like Paytm or Swipe Machine in the shop but they do not send their customers empty handed
 ramkishan ne bataaya ki agar kisi ke paas cash naa ho to vah bagal vaali dukaan kii madad se card swip karakar bhugtan lete hai
 Many buyers also said that the cash shortage could increase further
 aise main vah log duusare madhyamon ke jariye bhugtan ke istemaal kii aadat daal rahe hai
 Rakesh, who is shopping in the Patanjali store of the area, said that he pays in cash and does not even know how to run Paytm
 dilli ke jhandevalaan main padtaal karne par pataa chalaa ki yahaan vyavsaayik ilaake main kaam karne vaale tamaam karmchaaree khaanaa khaane ke liye alag-alag dukaanon kaa rukh karte hai
 Sonu, who owns a tea shop here, said that after the ban on demonetisation, people have also reduced the expenditure on tea and those who come only give cash
 swip card or petimjaisi suvidhaayen ke bare main sonu ne kaha ki unhen pataa hi nahin ki ye sab kahaan se milegaa or mil gaya to usko chalaane kaa kharch unke liye kaaphi mahangaa rahegaa
 There is also a facility to pay through Paytm and other means at a Chinese stall
 yahaan chhole kulche kii dukaan lagane vaale ravi ne to swip mashin or petm kaa naam tak nahin suna tha lekin notebandi ke 50 din bitne ke baad bhi kamai par zyada asar nahin padaa he
 The middle class and low income people live in Paharganj area of the capital, so the real picture of the cashless scheme can be understood from here
 yahaan cycle rickshaw chalaane vaale zyaadaatar logon ne kabhi petm kaa naam hi nahin suna or wo cash ke alaava kisi or madhyam se bhugtan nahin lete hai
 The battery rickshaw drivers of Paharganj are also upset with the impact at work
 lekin ummid he kinotbandi se kaala dhan khatmahoga
 Some riders said that rickshaw people only take cash
 kai rickshaw waalon ne kaha ki unke paas bank khaataa tak nahin he aise main vah kaise digital pement le sakate hai
 The condition of vegetable sellers and other street vendors in the area is also similar
 zyaadaatar ke paas bank khaataa nahin he, jinke paas he wo kisi bhi digital madhyam kaa istemaal nahin jaanate
 Some shopkeepers want to use these mediums but are still unable to become a part of Cashless India due to lack of basic facilities and information
 padtaal puri hone par ye pataa chalaa ki notebandi ke 50 din bitne ke baad cashles vyavastha kii shuruuaat to ho gai he lekin cashles arthvyavastha kii manzil abhi bahut dur dikhaai detii he

 The Himalayas are still restless
 bharat uttar kii ore khisak rahaa he or bukamp lagaataar aate rahenge
 Prediction in geology is problematic
 adhiktar bhugarbheey ghatnaayen jatil hoti hai or ek hi tareeke se khud ko duharaati nahin hai
 Unlike experimental sciences like physics and chemistry, the conditions we face here cannot be examined in a controlled environment within a laboratory
 hamaara samoochaa vigyaan paryvekshan par aadhaarit he
 We cannot even travel backwards in time
 ek hi tarika he ki ateet ke bukampon kaa adhyayan karte hue unke aaine main ham vartmaan ko dekhen or usase sabak len
 That is why it is necessary to identify the areas in the earthquake sensitive belt where earthquakes can occur - from Kashmir to Arunachal via Nepal and Bhutan, Arakan Yoma mountain ranges to andaman-nicobar and Indonesian islands
 vaigyanikon ko yah dekhne kii jarurat he ki koun se ilaake sabase zyada samvedansheel hai, daraaren kahaan se kahaan tak jaati hai or inamen kitna bada bukamp aa saktaa he
 They just have to take some proactive measures to reduce the damage: they should not be built in these areas, if they are, to ensure that they are seismic, not to build roads that can break
 yahi iklauta vikalp he
 Today, the Himalayas are a region that used to be the area between the Indian plate of the south and the Eurasian plate of the north
 in platon ko tethis naam kaa ek pracheen mahaasaagar saadhe paanch karod saal pehle vibhajit karata tha
 Just this year, this ocean disappeared under the Eurasian Plate and as a result the Indian continent merged with the Eurasian plot
 is takaraav se hone vaala milan aaj tak jari he jise himalay kii uttari or dakshini shrunkhalaaon ke bich sthit silsilewar daraaren lagaataar apane bheetar samahit karti rahati hai
 All of these cracks either sink to the north or create slopes (meaning they form an angle with the surface of the earth) and over time the vertical parts that rise above the cracks continue to move south
 isi vajah se yahaan dharti kii sataha sakht ho jaati he jisase himalay itani oonchai hasil kar paata he
 This process continues even today and that is why earthquakes keep coming up every now and then
 jab kabhi himalayan daraaron kaa dakshin kii ore khisakna baadhit hota he, tab bukamp aa jaataa he
 Even though the grandeur of the Himalayas is the result of these cracks, the destruction caused by the earthquake in the region of the Himalayas is also the result of this process
 himalayan kshetra se ulat himalay ke dakshin vaala hissaa (khaskar prayadweep, jise saamanytah bhartiya dhaal kehete hai) lambey samay se sthir rahaa he or arabon saal se apni jagah par bana hua he
 Within these primeval stones, there is evidence that years ago there was a disorder and geological scientists have also identified cracks in this area
 haalanki ye daraaren ab sakriy nahin rah gai hai or philhal inase koi khatra bhi najar nahin aa rahaa he
 Does this mean that the rest of the country should be considered free from earthquake danger? Unfortunately, it is not so
 bharat jis tarah se uttar main tibet kii ore khisakta ja rahaa he, iskaa adhiktar jor himalayan daraaron par hi pad rahaa he, is khiskaav kaa kuch asar sthir bhartiya dhaal par avashya padataa he or yadi yahaan kii kisi bhi pracheen daraar ke anukool yah khiskaav kabhi bhi hua (yadi ye daraaren himalayan daraaron ke takreeban samanaantar ho gayi) to ye puraani daraaren dobaaraa sakriy ho ja sakati hai
 Earthquakes in the slope region are rare, but they are destructive
 udhaaharan ke liye, ham jabalpur or latur ke bukamp ko yaad kar sakate hai
 This happens because these areas are densely populated and the magnitude of the earthquake has never been taken seriously
 isiilie ab dhire-dhire yah mahasoos kiya ja rahaa he ki puraani daraaron kii bhi pahchaan kii jaani chahie or inke jaagrit hone kii sambhaavnaaon ko sangyaan main liya janaa chahie
 In other words, by ignoring geology whether old or new, you are putting 100% of your life at risk
 aaj se dedh-do karod varshon baad himalay ko paidaa karne vaali chaalak shakti samaapt ho jaaegi
 The rate of erosion will increase over time due to glaciers, rain, cloudburst and strong winds
 phir kudarat santulan kaa khel khelte hue sambhawatah himalay ko ek pathaar kii tarah sapaat kar degi
 In such a situation, the elegance and splendor of the Himalayas will go away
 ho saktaa he ki tab aap paidal hi tibet yaa china tahaltey hue chale jaaen or raste main aapako pahaad na dikhaai den
 Obviously, none of us will be present then and of course, earthquakes will never come again after that

 supreme court ne vayusena main muslim afasar ansaari aftab ahamed kii yachika khaarij kar di he
 He was discharged from the Air Force in 2008 for having a beard

 Air Force officer Ansari Aftab Ahmed said in his petition that he had kept his beard on the basis of religion and the Air Force has discriminated him by removing him
 tippaniyan Aftab had said in his petition that it is his fundamental right to shave under the right to religious freedom given in the constitution
 unhone daleel di thi ki jis tarah vayusena main shaamil sikhon ko dadhi or pagadi rakhane kii ijaajat he usee tarah unhen bhi isaki anumati milani chahie
 Although the then UPA government, avoiding any strict steps, had directed that no action should be taken against the Muslims if they keep beards in the army, but later the government had spoken of the idea

 rishi kapur ne kaha, '' maine us samay janm liya jab maine dekha rus china main communism hat gaya, maine dekha ki south africa main kaala safed kaa bhed khatm ho gaya
 i also saw the East and West walls being dropped in Barlin, unifying Germany
 iske alaava maine yah dekha ki north korea or america aapas main baithkar charchaa kar rahe hai
 But this conflict between India and Pakistan since 1971 has not been resolved yet

 On this statement of Rishi Kapoor, Shatrughan Sinha said - Rishi Kapoor has said right that if America and North Korea can solve their problem by negotiation
 germany ke donon desh apni problem ko baatcheet karke sulajhaa sakate hai
 There are also examples in the world that the ruling party and the opposition together have run the government

 antarikshayan ne yah pataa laga liya he ki bouna grah pluto kaa vyas 2,370 kilometre he, jo pehle ke anumaanon se kahin zyada he

 Mission scientist Bill Makenan said that with the discovery of Pluto in the year 1930, its size was being debated

 Pluto's new approximate size means that its density is slightly lower than previously thought and that its interior has a slightly higher ice fraction

 Hello, Ravish Kumar
 
 
 bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja chahie
 JDU, RJD, Congress and BJP originally agreed to give these four types of special state status, but did not get it
 sab aapas main ek duusare se maangate rah gaye or chunaav aa gaya
 Everyone says that their method of demand is serious, the rest of the gimmick
 hamaari niyat unki niyat se safed he
 Lalu took a dig when Nitish Kumar tried to keep the issue in the public by calling a Bihar bandh on Sunday when schools, colleges and offices are closed
 itvaar ko to aisi hi band rahata he
 Although the idea of closing on Sunday is not bad, people will have less trouble
 isse pehle shanivaar shaam ko hi nitish kumaar ne thariya bartan bajaakar centre ko jagaane kaa prayaas kiya, lekin jab centre nahin jaagaa to uske agle din patna ke gandhi maidan main paanch ghante ke liye dharne par baith gaye
 When Arvind Kejriwal staged a sit-in, then how much constitutional, moral question was raised
 andhra pradesh ke bantwaare ke baad jab paanch saal ke liye simandhra ilaake ko vishesh darja diya gaya, nitish ne apana mudda phir se uthaa diya he
 It is said that the Congress, the BJP made a deal for Seemandhra and left Bihar under this deal
 simandhra ke liye to maang bhi nahin thi, jabaki bihar ke liye kab se maang he
 Why did the opposition BJP not pressurize it
 congress ne raghuramrajan report par koi karrwai nahin kii
 The report came in September 2013, which has suggested a way to give special status to Bihar and other backward states
 isamen vishesh rajya kaa darja jaisaa shabd to nahin tha, magar bihar ko desh ke das sabase kam viksit rajyon main shumaar kiya gaya he
 In 2009, the Bihar Legislative Assembly and in 2010 the Legislative Council passed a resolution to grant special status to the state
 paanch saal biit jane ke baad bhi yah maamla first year kii tarah har baar uthta rahata he
 Nitish Kumar also rallied on 17 March 2013 at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi
 june 2013 main bijepi se alag bhi ho gaye
 Apart from Modi opposition, it was cited as a big reason
 phir bhi darja nahin mila
 Nitish wants to surround opponents on this issue, but today BJP leader Arun Jaitley also tried to surround him
 jetali kaa aarope he ki pichley do saal se congress jediu ko vishesh rajya ke darje kaa laalach dikhaa rahi he
 In his 2013 budget speech, the Finance Minister had also indicated that Bihar's claim would be considered by forming a committee
 jetali ne likhaa he ki yah aashwaasan puri tarah se raajnneetik tha, taaki jediu bijepi se alag ho jaae
 i do not know how the clever leadership of JDU also got into this trap
 jetali blog likhte hai or modi mujffarpur kii raily main is par chup rahete hai
 Whereas BJP also organize a rail roko movement in Bihar before Nitish on 28th February
 google se is masale par kuch lekh praapt hue hai
 Indira Rajaraman, visiting professor at the Indian Statistical Institute of Delhi on rediff
com, wrote that Bihar's claim is not made
 bihar ko apana gaurav is baat main talashna chahie ki use vishesh rajya kaa darja nahin chahie
 In the Economic and Political Weekly of May 2013, Govind Bhattacharya wrote that Bihar does not live up to whatever standards are given to special state status
 bihar kaa pichhadaapan bhugolic kamiyon ke kaaran nahin he, balki ateet ke kharaab gavarnence ke kaaran he
 One cannot get status on the basis of poor governance
 aise to kai rajya isamen aa jaaenge
 Govind says that right now the largest part of the money that Bihar receives from the Center goes directly to the districts over which the state has no control
 vaise bhi vishesh rajya kaa darja dene ke liye jo gadgil mukherjee formula taiyaar kiya gaya tha, usamen ab teen kii jagah 11 rajya aa gaye hai, jabaki yojana raashi main koi vruddhi nahin hui he
 Therefore, even if we get the status of a special state, there is not going to be much money
 agar nitish vishesh darja kii jagah jilo ko die jane vaale paise par niyantran maang len, to zyada laabh ho saktaa he
 There is also an article by NK Singh
 jinhen nitish ne rajya sabha kaa sadsy phir se nahin banaaya
 i do not know what is the opinion of NK Singh at this time, but in the Economic Times of March 2013, he advocated that the provision of the Backward Region Grant Fund is with the Center
 2000 main jab bihar kaa punagarthan hua tab bhi bihar ko vishesh protsaahan raashi dene kii baat hui thi jo nahin mili
 There was a proposal to give 12 thousand crores in the twelfth plan, but the cabinet did not approve
 kendriya yojana madon ke bantwaare kaa maamla technical or jatil bhi he
 According to the economic survey of the state government in this February, the growth rate in 2012–13 was 13
 5 pratishat he
 There is an annual average of 12 percent in the last seven years
 2013 ke neshnal sample survey sanghathan ke aankade ke anusaar bihar main garibi 54 pratishat se ghatakar 33
 It is 7 percent
 phir bihar ko kyon chahie? kya nitish is mudde par bihar kii janata ko lalu-congress yaa bijepi-paswan kheme kii taraf jane se roak paaenge? sachmuch bihar iskaa hakdaar he yaa mahaj ye sabhi dalon kaa ek duusare ke khilaaf hathiyaar ban gaya he

 saujany: NEWSFLICKS The Modi government had pledged to free Muslim women from triple divorce by passing the anti-triple talaq bill in the winter session itself

 The bill could not pass in this session

 He said that all constitutional options are open to the government
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki vidheyak par congress kaa ravaiya nahin badla to sarkaar bajet satr se pehle adhyadesh laakar ise kanoonee amalijama pahana sakati he
 Let us know that the Modi government introduced the three anti-divorce bill 'the Muslim Women Protection of Rights in Marriage Act' in the Lok Sabha last week
 kuch vipakshi dalon ke virodh ke baavjood ye bill bina kisi sanshodhan ke paas ho gaya tha
 The Congress supported the bill in the Lok Sabha by filing dissent on some of the flaws
 rajyasabha main teen talaak bill pesh hua to congress puure tevar main najar ai or bill ko select cameti ko bhejne par adi rahi
 This bill could not be passed due to the lack of majority in the Rajya Sabha with the Modi government and the U-turn of the Congress
 jabaki modi sarkaar sadan main bahes karnaa chaahati thi, lekin congress sahit sabhi vipakshi dal is vidheyak main kuch sanshodhan ke liye select cameti ko bhejne par ade the
 Due to this, the bill could not be passed in Rajya Sabha
 modi sarkaar kaa kahana he ki yaadi congress teen talaak par koi sarthak or rachanaatmak suzav laaegi to us par khule dil se vichaar karne ko taiyaar he
 But a proposal that kills the soul of the Bill and increases injustice against women will not be accepted
 teen talaak dene waalon ko sajaa dilaane kaa kanoon banaaenge
 For this, the Modi government can somehow resort to the constitutional option

 ’prakaash singh ke mutabik adhikariyon main se kisi ne toote rail joints ko lekar bheje gaye apatkaaleen sandeshon kaa sangyaan nahin liya
 Prakash Singh said that engineers had requested Central Control to stop operating the trains for 20 minutes so that they could replace the damaged part of the track
 stesan master ne bataaya ki control ne iske liye manaa kar diya tha
 From there the answer was that Jan Shatabdi, Utkal and other trains were on their route
 control cmand ke mutabik us vakt trainon kaa sanchaalan block jari karne ke liye nirdesh dena sambhav nahin tha
 This sounds as bad and scary as it sounds, but according to station master Prakash Singh, the engineers had removed the track four feet from the route of Kalinga Utkal in Khatauli
 aisi sthiti main train kaa patari se utarana nishchit tha
 In Khatauli, junior railway engineer Mohan Lal Meena also supported what the station master Parkash Singh said
 meena ne daawa kiya ki unki taraf se trek repere ke liye likhit shikaayat bheji gai thi, jise kisi ne nahin suna
 Meena said, 'we had demanded a traffic block from the controlling command for repairs
 lekin aisa nahin hua
 Despite saying this in writing, a joint of the track has been broken and it may have resulted in an accident, we were not allowed
 ’reporter ne poocha, ‘unki taraf se kya kaha gaya tha?’ meena ne bataaya, ‘unhone sapaat manaa kar diya tha
 He said no block can be issued

 Sehwag said, 'every time i get to the crease and face the first ball, i get nervous
 main ise haalanki kabhi nahin dikhaata kyonki agar gendbaaj ise bhaanp legaa to vah mujhe dabaav main daalane kii koshish karegaa
 "I have to give a message to the bowler that i am here to face him with aggression and confidence, whether i play defensive shots or aggressive
" ’ sahvaag kaa maananaa he ki unki maansik majbootee or aatmavishvaas ne unhen antarrashtriya cricket main gendbaajon par dabadabaa banane main madad kii he
 The right-handed batsman told the BCCI official website today, 'I think it is mental strength
 mere andar aatm vishwaas or bharosa he ki main kisi bhi team ke khilaaf acha pradarshan kar saktaa hum or kisi bhi gendbaaji akraman ke khilaaf ran bana saktaa hum
 Sehwag said that he has made some changes in his way of batting and now he tries to stick to the wicket for some time before playing his shot
 unhone kaha, ‘ab main, ise lekar kuch adhik satark ho gaya hum ki wicket kis tarah kaa bartaav kar rahaa he, gend swing kar rahi he yaa nahin or gendbaaji akraman kaisaa he
 i give myself a little more time to get a kick and understand the situation better and then strategize my innings
 ’sahvaag ne kaha, ‘haalanki agar koi gendbaaj ghasiyaali pich par half vaali phenkata he to bhi main us par akraman karata hum or agar aaf said ke baahar gend short hoti he to squaire cat kheltaa hum
 "he said," But if a bowler bowls with a good line and length, i have to pay respect to the new ball
 agar main aisa karata hum or satarkta ke saath 10 se 12 over khel letaa hum to samay ke saath gend puraani ho jaati he or gendbaaj bhi thode thak jate hai
 After this i can target them
 ’yah poochne par ki sachin tendulkar or gautam gambhir ke saath pari kii shuruuaat karne main kya antar he, sahvaag ne kaha ki jab tendulkar unke saajhedaar hote hai to vah kam dabaav main hote hai
 Sehwag said, "when i bat with Tendulkar, there is less pressure on me because the opponents focus on getting them out
 gautam ke saath ballebaaji karte hue gendbaaj mujhe out karne ko lekar adhik chintit rahete hai
 So i have to be cautious
 iske alaava gautam or main kaaphi achche mitra hai or hamaare bich main kaaphi acha samvaad he

 The right-handed batsman said, i think it is mental strength
 mere andar aatmavishvaas or bharosa he ki main kisi bhi team ke khilaaf acha pradarshan kar saktaa hum or kisi bhi gendbaaji akraman ke khilaaf ran bana saktaa hum
 Sehwag said that he has made some changes in his way of batting and now he tries to stick to the wicket for some time before playing his shot
 sahvaag ne kaha, ab main, ise lekar kuch adhik satark ho gaya hum ki wicket kis tarah kaa bartaav kar rahaa he, gend swing kar rahi he yaa nahin or gendbaaji akraman kaisaa he
 i give myself a little more time to understand the situation and the situation better and then make my innings strategy
 sahvaag ne kaha, haalanki agar koi gendbaaj ghasiyaali pich par half vaali phenkata he, to bhi main us par akraman karata hum or agar of said ke baahar gend short hoti he, to squaire cat kheltaa hum
 "but if a bowler bowls with a good line and length, i have to pay respect to the new ball
" agar main aisa karata hum or satarkta ke saath 10 se 12 over khel letaa hum, to samay ke saath gend puraani ho jaati he or gendbaaj bhi thode thak jate hai
 After this i can target them
 tippaniyan Asked what is the difference in opening innings with Sachin Tendulkar and Gautam Gambhir, Sehwag said that when Tendulkar is his partner, he is under less pressure
 sahvaag ne kaha, jab main tendulkar ke saath ballebaaji karata hum, to mere upar kaaphi kam dabaav hota he, kyonki virdohi unhen out karne par dhyaan lagaate hai
 While bowling with Gautam Gambhir, bowlers are more concerned about getting me out, so i have to be cautious
 vaise gautam or main kaaphi achche mitra hai or hamaare bich main kaaphi acha samvaad he
 Sehwag said, every time i get to the crease and face the first ball, i get nervous
 main ise haalanki kabhi nahin dikhaata, kyonki agar gendbaaj ise bhaanp legaa, to vah mujhe dabaav main daalane kii koshish karegaa

 While bowling with Gautam Gambhir, bowlers are more concerned about getting me out, so i have to be cautious
 vaise gautam or main kaaphi achche mitra hai or hamaare bich main kaaphi acha samvaad he
 Sehwag said, "now i have become a bit more cautious about how the wicket is behaving, whether the ball is swinging or not and what the bowling attack is like
" main halaat or sthiti ko acchhee tarah samajhane ke liye khud ko thodaa adhik samay detaa hum or iske baad apni pari kii ranneeti banaata hum
 Sehwag said, "even if a bowler throws a half-wicket on a crooked pitch, i still attack him and if the ball is short outside the off side, i play a square cut
 unhone kaha, lekin agar koi gendbaaj acchhee line or length ke saath gendbaaji karata he, to mujhe nai gend ko sammaan dena padataa he
 If i do this and play 10 to 12 overs with caution, over time the ball gets old and the bowlers also get a little tired
 iske baad main unhen nishaanaa bana saktaa hum
 The comments yah puche jane par ki sachin tendulkar or gautam gambhir ke saath pari kii shuruyaat karne main kya antar he, sahvaag ne kaha ki jab tendulkar unke saajhedaar hote hai, to vah kam dabaav main hote hai
 Sehwag said, when i bat with Tendulkar, there is a lot of pressure on me, because the opponents focus on getting them out
 gautam gambhir ke saath ballebaaji karte hue gendbaaj mujhe out karne ko lekar adhik chintit rahete hai, isliye mujhe satark hona padataa he
 By the way, Gautam and i are very good friends and we have very good communication

 rail rajya mantri manoj sinha ne bhartiya railway kii suraksha kaa jimmaa uthaa rahi railway protection force (arpeef) ko or zyada takat die jane kii vakaalat kii he
 Addressing the All India Conference on Railway Security, he said that RPF is a toothless security force
 puure desh main railway kii jaruraton ko dekhte hue arpeef ko or zyada shashakt kiye jane kii jarurat he
 He said that RPF Act needs to be amended to give real strength to CRPF
 haalanki is maukey par bolte hue rail mantri piyush goyal ne kaha ki bhale hi kanoon main badlaav ho yaa naa ho, chaahe jiarapy ho siarpief in sabhi takneekee chizon main hamen naa padakar ek saath milakar rail yatriyon kii suraksha ke liye kaam karnaa chahie
 On this occasion, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that in view of the problems of the passengers, the online FIR in the train can be considered
 aparaadh darj karne kaa power nahingauratlab he ki deshbhar main arpeef railway kii sampattiyon railway stesan or railgadiyon kii suraksha kaa jimmaa uthaati he, lekin iske paas aparaadh darj karne kaa power nahin he
 For this, the responsibility of registering an FIR in every state has been given to the GRP
 aise main kisi train main agar koi aparaadh hota he to rail yatri ko sambandhit railway stesan par maujuud jiarapy thane main rapat likhaani padati he
 The problem with this is that the rail passenger does not know where the crime has happened to him
 jagah kaa pataa na chal paanaa chalati train main hue aparaadh ke liye yahi sabase badi dikkat he
 Apart from this, the other problem is that the railway passengers should complete their journey or go for FIR
 is samasyaon kaa saamana karte hue agar exiaar likhva bhi di jaati he to aparaadh ke niraakaran ke liye koi bhi rail yatri sudur jagahon se waapas aana pasand nahin karata
 In such a situation, it is not easy to punish the culprit in any crime that happened to the passengers on the moving train or at the railway station
 railway main hue aparaadhon kii is tarah kii dikkaton ko dekhte hue pichley kai saalon se is baat kii lagaataar maang kii ja rahi he ki arpeef act main badlaav karke exiaar darj karne kaa adhikaar diya jaae lekin centre or rajya me sahmati nahin ban paane kii vajah se yah maamla lambey samay se lataka hua he
 In view of the seriousness of this matter, Home Minister Rajnath Singh has suggested to start a system of online firs

 In a stern letter to Gadkari, Jethmalani also slammed Arun Jaitley for opposing the appointment of the CBI director
 bijepi se nilambit saansad ne kaha, ‘aapkaa nilamban kaa aadesh (jethmalani ko) adhikaar kshetra se baahar or sansadeey board ke adhikaar ko apane haathon main lene vaala he
 And there was no situation that you could go ahead without talking to me and do not follow common courtesy
 ’unhone kaha ki gadakari kii ore se unke khilaaf uthaaye gaye kadam kaa unpar koi prabhaav nahin padataa kyonki vah kanoonee peshey or raajnneeti main logon ke pyaar or sammaan kii vajah se hai jo sansad kii sadsyta kaa mohataaj nahin he
 Jethmalani said in his letter, 'I am confident that you are moving on a suicide path and you are intent on dragging the entire party into it
 'vinaash kaale, vipareet buddhi' puraani kahawat he
 He alleged that Gadkari was already motivated by maliciousness towards him and hence took the step of suspending him
 jethmalani ne apane patr main sibiai ke nideshak ke rup main ranjit sinha kii niyukti par vivaad ke vishay ko bhi uthaaya or is maamle main rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali kii kathith bhoomika kaa zikr kiya
 Jethmalani said that the case filed by Ranjit Sinha's rival is so infamous and our party leaders do not know about it
 unhone daawa kiya ki pratidwandvi adhikari kii pairvi karne vaale vakil jetali ke kanishtha rahe hai
 Jethmalani said, 'it is impossible that he (jaitley) is not aware of this suit filed before Kat and i feel that you (gadkari) are acting on Jaitley's advice
 ’unhone kaha ki unhen media se is baat kii jaankaree mili ki sibiai ke nideshak pad par niyukti kaa unki party ke netaa virodh kar rahe hai
 He complained to Gadkari that although he is a senior member of the Rajya Sabha and one of the founders of the BJP, the issue of Lokpal was not discussed by Sushma Swaraj, Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha and Arun Jaitley, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha
 taliban ke netaa moulana fajalullah ke sasur, sufi mohammad par pakistan sarkaar ne shikanja kas diya he
 The Pakistani government has filed a case against Sufi Muhammad under stringent anti-terrorism laws
 sufi par deshadroh or sarkaar ke kilaaf aatankwaad failaane jaise sangeen aarope lagaae gaye hai
 These cases have been imposed on him without a speech given in April
 tab sufi mohammad ne kaha tha ki use pakistan ke samvidhan, loktantric vyavastha or nyaay vyavastha main bharosa nahin
 Sufi once played the role of an intermediary between the government of Pakistan and the Taliban and now it is in the grip of the government

 irom shaadi karengi or chunaav ladengi
 Is it not that we all missed reading the story of Irom Sharmila properly
 aae din koi na koi netaa bharat ke loktantr kii mahanata kaa gungan karte rahete hai, kya ve log bhi chook gaye
 For sixteen years, one person has made his point through fasting, is his endurance not an example for the state systems of great democracy
 ek naagarik ke rup main aap irom sharmila kii sangharsh yatra ko kaise dekhnaa chahenge
 It will depend on how you look at the dharna demonstration or movement in democracy and whether you have ever been to a dharna demonstration
 hamamen se bahuton kii zindagi bina kisi andolan main gaye guzar jaati he
 By the way, people too can understand the importance of Irom Sharmila's movement
 hamaare netaa apane jail jane yaa lathi khaane kii kahani to bees baar sunaate hai magar irom jaise kisi naagarik ke sangharsh kii dastaan se kanni kaat lete hai
 After all, why Irom's decision could not be knocked like a big event
 jab tak wo anshan par raheen har andolan ke charam or dhiraj kii misaal banakar raheen
 What happened is that we and you now refrain from awarding such democratic struggles
 film and television istitute of india, hyderabad uniwarsity or jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr andolanon kii awaz sansad tak pahunchi, koob takaraaren huin magar ye andolan dhire dhire thande padane lage
 There are so many forms of government power that it is difficult for small groups to stand in front of it
 chaatr raajnneeti ko lekar tamaam sarkarein or raajnneetik dal sust ho chuke the
 But recent student conflicts put political parties on alert
 shaayad yahi vajah rahi hogi ki media or ritair naukarshahon ke zariye baar baar kaha jane laga ki chaatr collejon main padhane aate hai
 Do not come to do politics
 mantri tak bolne lage ki chaatro ko raajnneeti se dur rahanaa chahie
 They continue to sell tales of their youth, but do not want others to have the opportunity to narrate the anecdote that he had gone to the movement during college days
 jis desh kii azaadi kaa itihaas collejon main padhane vaale kai naujavaanon ke awaz uthaane se bharaa hua he ki kaise un yuvaaon ne kitaaben padhin, likhin, laathiyaan khain, jail gaye or faansee par chadh gaye
 In the same country, a retired bureaucrat, TSR Subrahmanyam Committee report, said that demonstrations, agitations, encirclement and other obstructing activities are increasing in the campus
 iske kaaran pariksha main deree hoti he or imtihaan sthagit hote hai
 The small group of politically active students creates such disruption
 ruthika chopra kii report kii hedline he ki campus main raajnneetik gatividhiyon ko simit kiya jaae
 One day another retired bureaucrat will come to report that people in the society have come to eat and die, not to agitate, it hurts the government
 gujarat main patel or dalit andolanon ko avaidh ghoshit kar degaa
 Without going to these questions, you cannot understand the extent and possibility of Irom Sharmila's story
 isliye aap itani aasaani se nahin samaj sakate ki kis tarah raajnneetik dal pradarshan karne kaa adhikaar sirf apane tak hi surakshit rakhana chaahate hai
 They take every step to declare the sit-in demonstration of citizens illegal and not give them space
 media ab in pradarshnon ko vyavdhaan kii tarah pesh karata he
 Cites the reason for the traffic jam
 ek pal ke liye sochiye ki agar chaatro, kisaanon mazaduron ke pradarshnon kii vaidhata nahin bachegi to tab kya hoga jab kisi mudde par saare raajnneetik dal haath mila len
 Silence after raising voice har shahar se dharna pradarshan kii jagahon ko samaapt kiya ja rahaa he
 There is talk of not allowing politics on campus
 to raajnneeti kahaan hogi
 In a beauty parlor or gymkhana club
 yahi kaaran he netaaon ne pradarshan kaa thikaana badal liya he
 They now surround each other's homes in Delhi
 jantar mantar kam jate hai
 The sit-in sit-in protesters do not surround them when they will raise our voice
 samuhik rup se nagarikon ke pradarshnon ko, andolanon ko vikaas virdohi bataakar ansuna karne kaa chalan badhata ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, continue a personal struggle for 16 years, although it has got the support of many people, but it seems no less than a wonder
 agar hamaare bheetar loktantrikta dhadkati he to irom sharmila kii kahani kyon nahin dhadkati he
 Talking from the point of view of the leaders, the democracy of India is becoming from greatest to greatest, at what point will this struggle of Irom Sharmila be placed in that great democracy
 main aapako irom ke bare main kuch bataanaa chahta hum
 Irom Sharmila would have been 42 years old, the Imphal girl has nine siblings
 saadhaaran mazdoor parivaar kii yah ladki teen baar main dasvin paas karti he lekin barahavin main fail hone ke baad wo apane pairon par khadaa hone kaa faisla karti he
 After learning typing and tailoring, she studies journalism
 imphal ke akhabaaron main uskaa kollam chhapane lagata he
 While writing poems in her diaries, Irom Sharmila begins to see the cruel faces of society and power scattered in Manipur
 cycle se shahar or gaanv naapane lagati he
 Becomes an intern for a human rights organization and investigates the effects of AFSPA legislation
 irom har brihastpivar ko upwas karti thim
 On one such Thursday, when she returns home on a bicycle, it is learned that 10 people have been killed in an encounter with the Assam Rifles in Malom
 inamen 60 saal kii ek mahila thi or 17 saal kaa ek ladkaa
 This is the incident of 2 November 2000
 us raat irom ne ek kaagaz par likhaa tha ki shanti kii shuruyaat kahaan or ant kahaan hoga
 Irom decided that she would go on hunger strike
 kisi ko pataa nahin chalaa ki irom agle 16 saal tak ke liye lambey upwas par baithne vaali hai
 i have taken this information from Deepti Priya Mehrotra's book titled Irom Sharmila and the adventure journey of Manipur people
 yah kitaab hindi main bhi he
 There is also a demonstration in Manipur against the Armed Forces Special Powers Act and voices are raised against it in Kashmir too
 irom kaa rasta kashmir kii awaazon se bilkul alag he
 Even though this law was not abolished, those who spoke of abolishing it also forgot Irom Sharmila
 netaaon ne bhi irom ko yaad kar kashmir ko nahin bataaya ki virodh hi karnaa he to ek rasta yah bhi he
 Irom Sharmila is also facing several charges of attempted suicide
 apana faisla bataate hue unhone kaha ki sarkaar unki awaz sun nahin rahi he or andolan ko kuchalati rahi he
 So she will come to politics to tell Delhi
 itane lambey upwas ke baad bhi itnaa lanbaa dhiraj
 Parliament should be commended for its rule, despite the fact that we disagree with Irom's demand but respect his peaceful and non-violent path
 7 janvari 2015 ko wal street jarnal se irom ne kaha tha ki ve saamaanya jivan main pravesh karnaa chaahati hai
 She does not want to be a saint or a goddess
 shanti pyaar or satya kaa doot bananaa chaahati hai
 The comments main nahin jaanata magar akhabaaron main padhaa he ki is lambey sangharsh ke dauraan irom kisi se pyaar bhi karti raheen
 Desmond Koutinho
 is tallukaat ko lekar vivaad bhi hua
 Those who supported his movement accused Desmond of misleading Irom Sharmila and weakening the AFSPA removal movement
 kuch kami hamaari he
 Those who do the movement, we understand that they will not even breathe
 geet bhi nahin gaate honge
 Irom told nothing to anyone
 jis tarah se upwas par baithte samay unki maa ko andaaza nahin tha, usee tarah upwas todane ke faisle kii jaankaree bhi unki 84 saal kii maa ko nahin thi
 Her mother's pledge was that she would not meet her daughter on hunger strike until AFSPA was removed
 16 saal kaa anshan samaapt ho rahaa he
 How much space will electoral politics create for Irom Sharmila, but in this too she is giving a big message
 usee yuva ko jo chunaavon se bhaagta he
 Does Irom Sharmila's decision to end the fast show that their struggle was in vain, is this the result of a person's strength in the face of Indian polity or is it something else
 aakhir kyon irom kaa yah faisla badi ghatana kii tarah dastak nahin de sakaa
 As long as she was an example of the extreme and endurance of every movement on hunger strike
 kya isliye hua ki ham or aap ab aise loktantric sangharshon ko ahmiyat dene se bachate hai
 The voice of the student movements of Film and Television Institute of India, University of Hyderabad and Jawaharlal Nehru University reached the Parliament, there was a lot of squabbles but these movements slowly started cooling down
 sarkaar kii takat ke itane rup hote hai ki uske saamne chote samoohon kaa tik paanaa mushkil hota he
 All governments and political parties had become dull about student politics
 lekin haal ke chaatr sangharshon ne raajnneetik dalon ko satark kar diya
 Perhaps this may have been the reason that through media and retired bureaucrats, it was often said that students come to college
 raajnneeti karne nahin aate hai
 The minister even started speaking that students should stay away from politics
 ve apni javaani ke kisse to bechate rahete hai magar chaahate hai ki dusron ko ye kissa sunaane kaa mauka na mili ki wo college ke dinon main andolan main gaya tha
 The country whose history of independence is full of the voices of many young people studying in colleges, how those youths read books, wrote, ate sticks, went to jail and were hanged
 isi desh main ek ritair naukarshah tii es aar subrahmanyam cameti kii report main kaha jaataa he ki campus main pradarshan, andolan, gheraav or anya baadha daalane vaali gatividhiyaan badhati ja rahi hai
 Due to this the examination is delayed and the examination is postponed
 raajnneetik rup se sakriy chaatro kaa chota sa samooh aise vyavdhaan paidaa karata he
 The headline of Ritika Chopra's report is to limit political activities on campus
 ek din koi or ritair naukarshah aayega jo report degaa ki samaaj main log khaane kamaane or marane aae hai, andolan karne nahin, isse sarkaar ko nuksaan hota he
 Will declare Patel and Dalit movements illegal in Gujarat
 bina in sawaalon par gaye aap irom sharmila kii kahani kii seemaa or sambhaavna ko nahin samaj sakate hai
 Therefore, you cannot easily understand how political parties want to protect their right to perform only to themselves
 ve nagarikon ke dharna pradarshan ko avaidh ghoshit karne or unhen jagah na dene kaa har upaay karte hai
 The media now presents these protests as a disruption
 trephic jam kaa kaaran bataata he
 For a moment, think that if the legitimacy of the demonstrations of students and peasants workers will not remain, then what will happen when all political parties join hands on an issue
 awaz uthaane kii khanaapurti kar chup ho jaaen
 The sites of picketing demonstrations are being eliminated from every city
 campus main raajnneetik na karne dene kii baat chal rahi he
 So where will politics be
 beauty parlor yaa gymkhana club main
 This is the reason leaders have changed the location of the demonstration
 dilli main ab ve ek duusare ke gharon ko gherte hai
 Jantar Mantar goes less
 vahaan pehle se baithe dharne vaale kahin unhen na gher len ki hamaari awaz kab uthaaoge
 The practice of collectively ignoring the protests of the citizens, the movements as anti-development, is increasing
 aise main koi vyaktigat sangharsh ko 16 saal tak jari rakhen, beshak use kai logon kaa samarthan mila ho lekin yah kisi ajoobe se kam nahin lagata
 If democracy beats within us then why the story of Irom Sharmila does not beats
 netaaon ke mukh se baat baat main bharat kaa loktantr mahaan se mahanatam hota ja rahaa he, usee mahaan loktantr main irom sharmila kaa yah sangharsh kis mukaam par rakhaa jayega
 i want to tell you something about Irom
 42 saal kii ho gai hongi irom sharmila, imphal kii is ladki ke nau bhai bahan hai
 This girl from ordinary laborer family passes tenth in three times but after failing in twelfth, she decides to stand on her feet
 typing or silaai seekhney ke baad patrakarita kii padhai padhati he
 His column appears in Imphal newspapers
 apni diariyon main kavita likhte likhte irom sharmila manipur main bikhare samaaj or satta ke krur chehron ko dekhne lagati he
 Bicycles measure the city and the village
 ek maanavadhikaar sanghathan ke liye intern banati he or AFSPA kanoon ke prabhaavon ko chaanbin karne nikalati he
 Irom used to fast on every Thursday
 aise hi ek brihaspativaar ko jab cycle se ghar lautati hai to pataa chalata he ki molom main 10 log assam rifles ke saath hui muthbhed main maare gaye hai
 These included a woman of 60 years and a boy of 17 years
 2 november 2000 kii yah ghatana he
 That night Irom wrote on a paper where the beginning and end of peace would end
 irom ne faisla kar liya ki ve bhukh hadtaal karengi
 No one came to know that Irom will be on a long fast for the next 16 years
 maine ye jaankaree dipti priya mehrotra kii kitaab se lee he jiskaa naam he irom sharmila or manipur janata kii saahas yatra
 This book is also in Hindi
 armd forces special power act ke khilaaf manipur main bhi pradarshan ho rahaa he or kashmir main bhi iske kilaaf awaazen uthati hai
 The path of Irom is completely different from the sounds of Kashmir
 bhale hi yah kanoon samaapt nahin hua lekin ise samaapt karne kii baat karne waalon ne bhi irom sharmila ko bhula diya
 Remembering Irom, the leaders also did not tell Kashmir that if there is a protest, there is a way
 irom sharmila par aatmahatya ke prayaas ke kai aarope bhi hai
 While stating his decision, he said that the government is not listening to his voice and has been crushing the movement
 isliye dilli ko sunaane ke liye wo raajnneeti main aaengi
 So long endurance even after such a long fast
 kaayade se sansad ko tarif kerani chahie is baat ke baavjood ki irom kii maang se ham asahmat hai lekin unke shantipurna or ahimsak raste kaa sammaan karte hai
 On 7 January 2015, Irom told the Wall Street Journal that she wanted to enter a normal life
 ve sant yaa devi nahin bananaa chaahatin
 Shanti wants to be the messenger of love and truth
 tippaniyan i do not know but i have read in the newspapers that Irom even continued to love someone during this long struggle
 desmund kautinho
 There was also a dispute about this connection
 unke andolan ko samarthan karne waalon ne desmund par aarope lagaaya ki wo irom sharmila ko bahaka rahaa he or AFSPA hataane ke andolan ko kamazor kar rahaa he
 We lack something
 jo andolan karte hai ham samajhate hai wo saans bhi nahin lete honge
 They would not even sing songs
 irom ne kisi se kuch nahin bataaya
 Just as his mother had no idea when he was fasting, his 84-year-old mother was also unaware of the decision to break the fast
 unki maa kaa pran tha ki jab tak AFSPA hatega nahin tab tak ve anshan par baithi apni beti se nahin milengi
 The 16-year fast is ending
 chunavi raajnneeti irom sharmila ke liye kitni jagah banaaegi, lekin isamen bhi wo ek bada sandesh de rahi hai
 The same youth who runs away from elections
 kya irom sharmila kaa anshan samaapt karne kaa faisla bataata he ki unka sangharsh bekaar rahaa, bhartiya rajya vyavastha ke saamne ek vyakti kii takat kaa yahi anjaam hota he yaa kuch or baat bhi he
 One day another retired bureaucrat will come to report that people in the society have come to eat and die, not to agitate, it hurts the government
 gujarat main patel or dalit andolanon ko avaidh ghoshit kar degaa
 Without going to these questions, you cannot understand the extent and possibility of Irom Sharmila's story
 isliye aap itani aasaani se nahin samaj sakate ki kis tarah raajnneetik dal pradarshan karne kaa adhikaar sirf apane tak hi surakshit rakhana chaahate hai

 media ab in pradarshnon ko vyavdhaan kii tarah pesh karata he
 Cites the reason for the traffic jam
 ek pal ke liye sochiye ki agar chaatro, kisaanon mazaduron ke pradarshnon kii vaidhata nahin bachegi to tab kya hoga jab kisi mudde par saare raajnneetik dal haath mila len
 Silence after raising voice har shahar se dharna pradarshan kii jagahon ko samaapt kiya ja rahaa he
 There is talk of not allowing politics on campus
 to raajnneeti kahaan hogi
 In a beauty parlor or gymkhana club
 yahi kaaran he netaaon ne pradarshan kaa thikaana badal liya he
 They now surround each other's homes in Delhi
 jantar mantar kam jate hai
 The sit-in sit-in protesters do not surround them when they will raise our voice
 samuhik rup se nagarikon ke pradarshnon ko, andolanon ko vikaas virdohi bataakar ansuna karne kaa chalan badhata ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, continue a personal struggle for 16 years, although it has got the support of many people, but it seems no less than a wonder
 agar hamaare bheetar loktantrikta dhadkati he to irom sharmila kii kahani kyon nahin dhadkati he

 main aapako irom ke bare main kuch bataanaa chahta hum
 Irom Sharmila would have been 42 years old, the Imphal girl has nine siblings

 After learning typing and tailoring, she studies journalism
 imphal ke akhabaaron main uskaa kollam chhapane lagata he

 Bicycles measure the city and the village
 ek maanavadhikaar sanghathan ke liye intern banati he or AFSPA kanoon ke prabhaavon ko chaanbin karne nikalati he
 Irom used to fast on every Thursday
 aise hi ek brihaspativaar ko jab cycle se ghar lautati hai to pataa chalata he ki molom main 10 log assam rifles ke saath hui muthbhed main maare gaye hai
 These included a woman of 60 years and a boy of 17 years
 2 november 2000 kii yah ghatana he
 That night Irom wrote on a paper where the beginning and end of peace would end
 irom ne faisla kar liya ki ve bhukh hadtaal karengi
 No one came to know that Irom will be on a long fast for the next 16 years
 maine ye jaankaree dipti priya mehrotra kii kitaab se lee he jiskaa naam he irom sharmila or manipur janata kii saahas yatra
 This book is also in Hindi
 armd forces special power act ke khilaaf manipur main bhi pradarshan ho rahaa he or kashmir main bhi iske kilaaf awaazen uthati hai
 The path of Irom is completely different from the sounds of Kashmir
 bhale hi yah kanoon samaapt nahin hua lekin ise samaapt karne kii baat karne waalon ne bhi irom sharmila ko bhula diya
 Remembering Irom, the leaders also did not tell Kashmir that if there is a protest, there is a way
 irom sharmila par aatmahatya ke prayaas ke kai aarope bhi hai
 While stating his decision, he said that the government is not listening to his voice and has been crushing the movement
 isliye dilli ko sunaane ke liye wo raajnneeti main aaengi
 So long endurance even after such a long fast
 kaayade se sansad ko tarif kerani chahie is baat ke baavjood ki irom kii maang se ham asahmat hai lekin unke shantipurna or ahimsak raste kaa sammaan karte hai
 On 7 January 2015, Irom told the Wall Street Journal that she wanted to enter a normal life
 ve sant yaa devi nahin bananaa chaahatin
 Shanti wants to be the messenger of love and truth
 tippaniyan i do not know but i have read in the newspapers that Irom even continued to love someone during this long struggle
 desmund kautinho
 There was also a dispute about this connection
 unke andolan ko samarthan karne waalon ne desmund par aarope lagaaya ki wo irom sharmila ko bahaka rahaa he or AFSPA hataane ke andolan ko kamazor kar rahaa he
 We lack something
 jo andolan karte hai ham samajhate hai wo saans bhi nahin lete honge
 They would not even sing songs
 irom ne kisi se kuch nahin bataaya
 Just as his mother had no idea when he was fasting, his 84-year-old mother was also unaware of the decision to break the fast
 unki maa kaa pran tha ki jab tak AFSPA hatega nahin tab tak ve anshan par baithi apni beti se nahin milengi
 The 16-year fast is ending
 chunavi raajnneeti irom sharmila ke liye kitni jagah banaaegi, lekin isamen bhi wo ek bada sandesh de rahi hai
 The same youth who runs away from elections
 kya irom sharmila kaa anshan samaapt karne kaa faisla bataata he ki unka sangharsh bekaar rahaa, bhartiya rajya vyavastha ke saamne ek vyakti kii takat kaa yahi anjaam hota he yaa kuch or baat bhi he
 i have taken this information from Deepti Priya Mehrotra's book titled Irom Sharmila and the adventure journey of Manipur people
 yah kitaab hindi main bhi he
 There is also a demonstration in Manipur against the Armed Forces Special Powers Act and voices are raised against it in Kashmir too
 irom kaa rasta kashmir kii awaazon se bilkul alag he
 Even though this law was not abolished, those who spoke of abolishing it also forgot Irom Sharmila
 netaaon ne bhi irom ko yaad kar kashmir ko nahin bataaya ki virodh hi karnaa he to ek rasta yah bhi he
 Irom Sharmila is also facing several charges of attempted suicide
 apana faisla bataate hue unhone kaha ki sarkaar unki awaz sun nahin rahi he or andolan ko kuchalati rahi he
 So she will come to politics to tell Delhi
 itane lambey upwas ke baad bhi itnaa lanbaa dhiraj
 Parliament should be commended for its rule, despite the fact that we disagree with Irom's demand but respect his peaceful and non-violent path
 7 janvari 2015 ko wal street jarnal se irom ne kaha tha ki ve saamaanya jivan main pravesh karnaa chaahati hai
 She does not want to be a saint or a goddess
 shanti pyaar or satya kaa doot bananaa chaahati hai
 The comments main nahin jaanata magar akhabaaron main padhaa he ki is lambey sangharsh ke dauraan irom kisi se pyaar bhi karti raheen
 Desmond Koutinho
 is tallukaat ko lekar vivaad bhi hua
 Those who supported his movement accused Desmond of misleading Irom Sharmila and weakening the AFSPA removal movement
 kuch kami hamaari he
 Those who do the movement, we understand that they will not even breathe
 geet bhi nahin gaate honge
 Irom told nothing to anyone
 jis tarah se upwas par baithte samay unki maa ko andaaza nahin tha, usee tarah upwas todane ke faisle kii jaankaree bhi unki 84 saal kii maa ko nahin thi
 Her mother's pledge was that she would not meet her daughter on hunger strike until AFSPA was removed
 16 saal kaa anshan samaapt ho rahaa he
 How much space will electoral politics create for Irom Sharmila, but in this too she is giving a big message
 usee yuva ko jo chunaavon se bhaagta he
 Does Irom Sharmila's decision to end the fast show that their struggle was in vain, is this the result of a person's strength in the face of Indian polity or is it something else

 ) Kapil Sharma's career, which has emerged as a synonym for comedy across the country in the last few years, is in its most difficult phase so far
 unako lekar tamaam tarah kii charchaaon or afvaahon kaa bazaar garm he
 People want to know what happened that only after three episodes had to suspend Comedy King's new show 'family Time with Kapil Sharma'? Kapil's close friends are seeing the possibility of conspiracy behind it, while his former manager and the people in the team are linking it with Kapil's arbitrary and mental state
 kai kirdaar or unki bhoomikaayen saamne aa rahi hai
 Till now, statements of several close acquaintances of Preity Simos, Niti, Vicky Lalwani and Kapil have been revealed
 priti ne to kapil ko ek baar phir rihaib centre jane tak kii salaah de daali, vahiin niti ne ek khulaa khat likhakar kaha he ki 'ham' dil se salbhar se kapil sharma kii madad karne kii koshish main hai
 Somewhere in this Ham also includes Neeti's sister Preeti, who was Kapil's former manager and reports of her affair with the comedian have also surfaced
 niti kapil se meeting bhi karnaa chaahati hai, haalanki kapil se kisi sidhi baatcheet main niti apane vakeelon or police kii maujuudagi ko jaruri maanati hai
 How does Niti want to help Kapil? For Kapil, the biggest help at this time would have been that his old wounds would have been left without any scourge
 lekin niti or priti ke bayaan kapil ke bifarne yaa uksaave ke liye paryaapt maane ja sakate hai
 Actually, in the previous statement, Preeti was seen calling Kapil a mental
 unhone kaha, kapil ko suicide ke khyaal aate hai
 He needs to go to the rehab center again
 kapil prakaran main maujuuda chapter ko gaur se dekhen to is baar jin chizon par vivaad hua uski vajah ke peeche kaaphi had tak simos bahanen najar aati hai
 Kapil's own habits are also no less responsible for such a situation
 haalanki is baar celibrity kaa keval ek shoot cancel hua tha jiske peeche kapil kii apni vajahen thim
 He also tweeted about the shoot of Tiger and told what the truth is
 kapil kii ko-star ne kiya khulaasa, 10 din se nahin hui sho kii shootingdrasal, kaha ja rahaa he ki vivaad salbhar pehle tab se jari he jab kapil ne ginni ke saath apane relationships kii anounsament kii thi
 Preeti was reported to be unhappy with the announcement
 lekin unki bahan niti relationships kii khabaron ko khaarij karti hai
 In many reports, it was even written that Preeti had warned Kapil about the dangers of such a relationship with Ginni
 isi dauraan flite main sunil grover ke saath kapil kaa vah vivaad bhi saamne aayaa jisaki vajah se kapil kii team main daraar pad gai
 No need to tell what happened then
 team tuutane ke baad lagaataar kai chijen kapil ke khilaaf gayi
 Due to the cancellation of the shoot, drinking more alcohol and being physically tired, the channel first offered to air Kapil's show and later announced its closure
 phir kapil kii firangi ai or buree tarah flop hui
 It was but natural for a good artist to be apprehensive about the dangers of the future in the conflict with Sunil and what happened to Kapil till Firangi flopped
 saport main aae kiku, bole- kapil ke khilaaf banaaya ja rahaa he maahaulakapil ko kathith taur par sunil ko juuta maarane kii apni galati par pachhtaawaa bhi hua
 It is important to mention that Kapil apologized to Sunil dozens of times in public forums and once again expressed his desire to work with him
 haalanki is puri avadhi main sunil, kapil se jude vivaad or dobaaraa saath aane ke sawaal par chuppi saadhe najar aae
 But, as soon as Kapil's new TV show was announced in 2018 and his promo appeared, Sunil's chapter appeared
 kisi prashansak ke ek sawaal ko sunil grover ne ritvit kiya or salbhar main pehali baar kapil sharma kaa naam liya
 He wrote that i also wanted to work with him on this show (family Time with Kapil Sharma Show)
 maine unki kol kaa intjaar kiya
 When no call came, i joined a new show (jio Dhan Dhana Dhan) yesterday
 sunil kaa ye ritvit 16 march ko kiya gaya tha
 Interestingly, during the release of Firangi, the world Jahan tweeted and congratulated Kapil but Sunil did not write anything
 apane intervyuuj main wo kapil se jude sawaal taalte rahe
 Sunil's sudden tweet raises many questions
 darasal, sunil ke mutabik ek din pehle hi unhone cricket aadhaarit kamedi sho 'dhan dhana dhan' sin kiya
 Was this big show about IPL designed a day before? How can a show be produced on short notice? That is, there are enough arguments to easily dismiss Sunil's statement that i was waiting and joined the show yesterday (march 15)
 yani sunil pehle se hi is sho kii taiyaariyaan kar rahe the
 The funny thing is that there are some old people who have reduced with Kapil in this show of Sunil
 sabase dilachasp naam priti or niti simos kaa he
 Let me tell you that Sunil's web show is produced by Lil Frodo Productions, which is run by Preity and Niti together
 sunil ke twit ke baad sho aane tak jis tarah kii reports chalin unhone kapil ke puraane jakhm kurede hi honge
 Surely these things must have been discussed around Kapil too
 iske baad jis tarah kapil ke sho kii negative rivyus saamne aae kapil buree tarah se bhadak gaye
 In the eyes of Kapil, Simos sisters were behind it
 unhone dhadadhad twit kiye or gaali galouj kii
 Actually, how Simos Chapter is surrounded by questions in Kapil's current controversy can also be estimated by listening to Kapil's viral audio with Vicky Lalwani
 kapil priti kaa naam lete hai or yah kehane kii koshish karte hai ki priti kii vajah se vicky kii website 'spotboy' main unke khilaaf lagaataar negative khabaren chalaa rahe hai
 Let us tell you that the news related to the loss to Sony when Kapil's show was canceled, also ran on 'spotboy'
 kapil ke dost or unki film ke nirdeshak rajeev dhingra ne bhi haalia ek intervyuu main kaha ki priti ne hi kapil ke khilaaf unke doston (sambhavat : sunil) ko bhadakaayaa
 Kapil forgot by hitting the shoe, but the shoe-eater has tied that incident till now
 to kya simos bahanon ne sunil ke sho kaa pramotion karne ke liye kapil ke puraane jakhm kured kar vivaad khadaa kiya? bahut saare sawaalon ke jawaab abhi aane baaki hai
 Hopefully Kapil will overcome this difficulty

 telecom company vodaphone ne haal hi main apane graahakon ke liye 16 rupee kaa filmi richarge plan pesh kiya tha
 This plan was introduced for the data needs of customers with a day's validity
 is baar company ne zyada keemat or zyada validity vaala plan pesh kiya he
 The company has priced the new plan at Rs 999
 vodaphone ke is nae plan main graahakon ko data ke alaava colling or SMS ke bhi phaayde milenge
 It is believed that Vodafone has launched this plan to compete with Airtel's prepaid plan of Rs 998
 kyonki donon hi plance ke phaayde lagbhag ek jaise hai
 In this new 999 rupees plan of Vadafone, customers will get 12GB 4G / 3G data during the entire validity of 365 days
 iske alaava is plan main ek saal ke liye free roming ke saath analimited colling kaa bhi phayda milegaa
 Customers should keep in mind that they will not get any talk-time benefit in this new plan of Vodafone
 haalanki is plan main free colling or data ke saath roj 100SMS jarur milegaa
 It is worth noting that the company has introduced this plan especially for those customers who have a high use of calling and who do not pay much attention to the data
 is plan main ek saal ke liye die ja rahe 12GB 4G / 3G data kii baat karen to aajkal itnaa data smartphone yugers ke liye kuch zyada nahin hota he
 Apart from this, customers will also get free access to the Vodafone Play app in this plan
 philhal vodaphone ne apane is plan ko keval chuninda cirkilon ke liye launch kiya he
 Hopefully it will be rolled out in all circles soon
 abhi punjab cirkil ke yugers is plan se richarge kar sakate hai
 On the other hand, talking about Airtel's Rs 998 plan, the company offers 12GB data, unlimited voice calling, 100SMS daily and free subscription of Airtel TV
 is plan kii validity 336 dinon kii he

 The trailer of the film got tremendous response from the audience and the film is going to be released on 26 April
 pachchis saal kii punitha ke maayke or sasuraal main mahilaayein pehle bhi ghar kii charadivari se baahar nikalati thim, lekin unka safar sirf ghar se khet or khet se ghar tak hi simit tha
 When Punita asked to open her beauty parlor after marriage five years ago, the family members were shocked
 punitha kii saas 68 varshiya kamala devi bhadq uthin, ''ghar kii bahu kaam karegi
 What will be respected in the village? '' lekin is bich duniya kaaphi badal chuki he
 Now that Punita's parlor has started running and every month she gets around Rs 10,000
 tak kii kamai kar leti he to kamala devi muskuraakar kahati hai, ''mujhe bahu par garv he
 Every girl should work
 ''ve muskuraakar apni bhaunhen dikhaati hai, jinhen lakh manaa karne ke baavjood hath main aakar punitha ne threading se sanvaar diya he
 Kamla Devi was also afraid of respect because of the Khap Panchayat in the village Malikpur, which is about 40 km from the district headquarters of Sonepat, is very much dominated
 khaapon ke stri virdohi farmaanon se koi anjaan nahin, lekin unke khauf se beparwaah ab is gaanv kii ladkiyaan or auraten apni bhunhon, baalo or chehre ko sanvaar rahi hai
 Like Malikpur, in Kankbar, a village 30 km from district Azamgarh in eastern Uttar Pradesh, nobody had even heard of the name of the beauty parlor ten years ago, when 35-year-old Sushma Soni thought of opening a parlor
 gaanv kii auraten badi hasarat or achraj se sari kaa kor munh main dabaae dhaage se khinch-khinchakar bhunhon ko sundar aakaar detii sushamaa ko dekhti
 With a white cream called Sushma Face Pack, the face started glowing
 gaanv main tab tivi bhi nahin aayaa tha
 All these things seemed to be from another planet
 lekin aaj chaahe kheton main kaam karne vaali aurat ho, sir par boj dhone vaali majdoor yaa inter college main pard rahi yuva ladki, sab sushamaa ke beauty parlor main aati hai
 She says, "everyone wants to look beautiful
 gaanv kii auraten bhi advance ho gai hai
 Along with the parlor, Sushma also does stitch-embroidery work and this costs around Rs 5,000-6,000
 maheenaa kama leti hai
 15,000 in the wedding season, earning Rs
 tak pahunch jaati he
 For him, this journey of ten years was not easy at all
 gharavaalon ne kaaphi virodh kiya, samaaj ne tedi najaron se dekha, lekin jab apni kamai ke chaar paise haath main hon to sabakaa munh band ho hi jaataa he
 Psychiatrist Sudhir Kakkar says, "you cannot always criticize the market by accusing it of being patriarchal
" beshak vahaan mardon kaa swaamitv he, lekin kaaphi had tak usee bazaar ne auraton ko parivaar kii saamanti chauhaddi se baahar nikaala he
 "by making his own identity with his earnings, everyone has silenced Neelamalata Srivastava, 37 years old, of Kankbar in Azamgarh
 maamuli se dikhte ek chote-se ghar ke andar do kamaron main neelam apana parlor chalaati hai
 There are 30-35 girls flocking in a room covered with iron latch wooden doors and a small screen of terricots
 yahaan har ladki kuch kaam kar rahi he
 Neelam decided to move out of the house after 18 years of marriage, went to Azamgarh at the age of 34 and did a beautician course and now not only runs her own beauty parlor, but just Rs 25
 maheenaa lekar maamuli pariwaron va nichali jatiyon kii ladakiyon ko beautisian kii training bhi detii hai
 Most of them are girls from poor, marginal families
 kuch kii maang main sindur bhi bharaa he, jo byaah ke baad gaune kaa intjaar karte hue kuch seekhney kii koshish kar rahi hai
 a 22-year-old girl visiting him is from a disadvantaged caste family of Neetu village
 uske kachi phoos ke ghar main bijli nahin he, shauchalay bhi nahin
 The paved road connecting the village to the city also does not reach his house
 lekin pataa nahin kab, uske sapanom main ek pakki sadak ban gai, jis par chalakar vah bahut dur nikal ai he
 Neetu says, "after finishing the course, i will open my own beauty parlor
 '' kya hoga agar shaadi ke baad sasuraal waalon ne ijaajat nahin di? vah kahati he, ''parvaah nahin
 i will understand them, i will fight if needed, but i will definitely work
 ''purvi uttar pradesh kii ek ladki main yah himmat kahaan se ai? is samaaj kii ladkiyaan aise nahin bolaa karti thim
 Sushma now Rs 10,000
 kamaane lagi hon, lekin bina ghunghat kaadhe parlor ke parde se baahar jhankati bhi nahin
 The daughter-in-law of the family who stayed
 lekin nai peedi kii ladakiyon kaa sur dekhakar lagata he ki ve na sirf apane paise kamaayengi, balki in bandhanon ko bhi todengi
 Every girl who comes to Neelam's parlor has a dream in her eyes
 unhen lagane laga he ki kaam karne, paise kamaane kii duniya chuulhe-chauke kii duniya se behatar he
 These confidence and dreams can be read in their eyes
 sudur maamuli gaanvon kii ladakiyon kii jindagi main ye sapane kab dabe paanv daakhil ho gaye? purvi uttar pradesh ke hi ek jile ambedkar nagar ke paahitipur gaanv kii kumkum pandeya ne to beauty parlor kaa course karne kii jid main sasuraal hi chhod di
 Even though the women of the deprived castes have been working in the fields, the women of the brahmin-thakur family do not even stand at the door of the house in broad daylight
 brahman parivaar kii bahu dukaan chalaaegi, sochakar hi gharavaalon kaa kalejaa kaanp gaya
 But Kumkum did not give up and the in-laws had to bow down
 paahitipur kii 35 varshiya rekha tiwari parlor se 10,000 ru
 Earns up to Rs
 ve kahati hai, ''paisa kamaane vaali auraton kii ghar main izzat bad jaati he
 "after all, nobody complains about marketism! 25-year-old Supriya Chaudhary opened the first beauty parlor in village Devdha in Madhubani district of Bihar
 yah vicitra-si cheez thi
 So to attract women initially, Supriya did free threading, facials and haircutting for a year
 ab fatafat ghar ke jaruri kaam nipataakar ve baaki kaa vakt parlor main hi gujaarti hai or maheene ke 5,000-6,000 ru
 Earns up to Rs
 haa, shaadi ke mausam main aamadani bad jaati he
 30-year-old Sangeeta Devi, who runs a parlor in her home in Devdha, is sad that she does not have a separate room for the parlor due to the house being small
 lekin ve kahati hai, ''bina alag kamare ke hi parlor se maheene main 3,000-4,000 ru
 Income is made and this money is a great support for the family
 '' devdha main mahila sarpanch sita devi kahati hai, ''yah bahut acchhee shuruyaat he
 Now women are becoming aware and earning money too
 ''beauty parlor kaa shauk maidaanon se chalakar ab pahaado tak bhi pahunch chukaa he, jahaan sudur seemaant gaanvon main bhi parlor khulne lage hai
 Kamala Devi, 32, who runs a beauty parlor in Matkot on the banks of the Mandakini River in Pithoragarh district, along the Chinese border, is no less than a celebrity in the area
 ghati main aasapaas ke 24-25 gaanvon se mahilaayein yahaan threading or heirkating ke liye aati hai
 If the girls going to school and college do not have much money in their hands, then they get satisfaction by having a thread of ten rupees
 dur ke gaanv se maheene kii kharidari ke liye bazaar aane par beauty parlor janaa ab jindagi kaa ahm hissaa ho gaya he
 The eyebrows of a hill woman taking wood from the forest are also threaded
 kamala kahati hai, ''yahaan zyaadaatar mahilaayein threading karwaane hi aati hai
 They get facials or bleach only on special occasions
 gaanv kii auraton or skool jane vaali ladakiyon ke haath main zyada paise nahin hote
 '' But from this parlor in Kamla's hand Rs 5,000-6,000 a month
 aa jate hai
 She says, "this is my first step towards self-reliance
 ''gramin mahilaayein threading or hair kating hi karwaati hai yaa dulhan kaa mechap
 Pedicures, manicures, waxing etc
 are not allowed
 puri duniya main hathiyaaron ke baad saundarya kaa bazaar sabase teji se badhata hua bazaar he
 According to the Confederation of Indian Industries, the total market of beauty in India is $ 95 crore (rs 5,334 crore)
 ) kaa he, jisamen prati varsh 15 se 20 fisadi kii badhat ho rahi he
 An important book on beauty is beauty prison for writer Naomi Wolf, who wrote The Beauty Myth, but Indian feminist writer Urvashi Butalia has a different view on the growing beauty consciousness of rural women, "the concept of market-given beauty is undoubtedly effective
" , But the village's beauty parlor is a commercial venture
 pichhadi, ashikshit gramin auraton ke liye yah unhen bahari duniya main le jane vaali ek khidki he
 In the words of British writer Virginia Wolf, this is the "room of Once Upon" of those women
 unka apana cameraa, jahaan ve apni aazaadee, apni kamai or apane sapanom kii duniya rach rahi hai
 Says author Anamika, "local beauty parlors in the small, old neighborhoods of villages and cities are a source of income for women, as well as new bases in Bahnape, where four women work together to enhance their looks and pleasures
 Grief also shares
 ghar, pati, bachche, saas, rasoi or gharelu kaamkaaj se itar yah unka apana nayaa spes he
 "every woman's freedom begins with 'apna room' and 'apne earning'
 gaanv ke chote-chote beauty parloron ne yahaan kii auraton ko ye donon chijen di hai
 The sky of freedom is still small, but only a few inches, its size is increasing every day
 -saath main santosh kumaar, sudhir singh or praveen bhatta West Indies explosive batsman Chris Gayle, popularly known as 'universe Boss', believes KL Rahul has the ability to match Indian captain Virat Kohli's achievements if he stays in his 'realm'
 rahul shaayad apni jindagi ke sabase mushkil daur se baahar nikal chuke hai, jisamen australia main test maichon main kharaab pradarshan or phir televijan kaarykram main team ke saathi hardik pandya ke saath mahila virdohi tippaniyon ke baad bisisiai nilambit kiya janaa shaamil he
 Rahul has left these things behind and made it one of the most dangerous opening pairs of the current season with Gayle for Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League
 gail ne pitiai se kaha, ‘jab aap bhartiya ballebaajon kii baat karte hai, to keel (rahul) aise khilaadiyon main se ek he jo mere dimag main aate hai, main ummid karuunga ki vah viraat kohli kii tarah shandaar khilaadi bane
 After Virat, he should take the responsibility of the team
 ’gail ne haalanki rahul ko bevajaah dabaav nahin lene kii naseehat di
 He said, 'it is important for them not to take undue pressure, they should trust themselves and avoid competition from anyone
 ’apane paanchaven vishwa cap main khilne ke liye taiyaar 39 saal ke gail ne kaha, ‘bharat main aapke paas pratibha kii kami nahin he or zyaadaatar khilaadiyon ko khilne kaa mauka bhi nahin miltaa he
 Gayle, who is in fine form in the IPL, has scored 444 runs in 10 matches of the season
 jamaica ke is khilaadi ko punjab kii team ne pichley saal aadhaar mulya par kharida tha
 He, however, falsified the franchises that did not bid themselves at player auctions
 gail ne kaha, ‘ kings ilevan punjab ke saath do saal shandaar rahe

 enie kii jaanch main khulaasa hua he ki kerala iesas modul kaa mukhya mastermind abdulla raashid telegram group banaakar kerala ke yuvakon ko bhadakaane kii koshish main juta hua he
 At the behest of it, more than one and a half dozen people went to Afghanistan and joined the ISIS module
 enie sutron ke mutabik, mohammad abdulla raashid afghanistan main maujuud he
 He operates a telegram group called 'gold Dinar 4'
 usamen vah kerala ke yuvakon ko iesas jwine karne kii baat bhi karata he
 He says that there is a need to spread violence in India
 usne is telegram group main yah bhi daawa kiya he ki saikadon kii sankhya main kerala main iesas ke samarthak maujuud hai
 Investigating this, Mohammad Rashid Abdullah's Telegram group named Gold Dinar 1, Gold Dinar 2 and Gold Dinar 3 has already been deleted
 kerala modul kaa mukhya mastermind mohammad raashid abdulla lagaataar nae-nae telegram group banaakar kerala ke yuvakon ko ISIS jwine karne or bhadakaane main juta hua he
 In the month of November last year too, Abdullah Rashid released threatening audio clips of ISIS
 clip main kumbh meley or trishur puram (kerala main manaaya jane vaala hindu tyohaar) main hamalaa karne kii baat kahi gai thi
 Both these fairs are such that devotees gather in large numbers
 jo audio clip saamne ai thi wo malayalam bhashaa main thi
 In this clip, a terrorist was provoking his supporters in India
 ye koi or nahin abdulla raashid hi tha
 Once again, by releasing audio clips of this method in Telegram Group, he is trying to incite the youth of Kerala
 pichley saal enie ne iesas ke do sanchaalak abdul raashid abdulla or yasmine mohammad jaahid ke khilaaf ek aarope patr daakhil kiya tha
 Abdullah was the main accused in this
 usne kasargod ke kai yuvakon ko apane parivaar samet desh chhodkar islamic state main shaamil hone ke liye prerit kiya tha
 Yasmin Mohammad Zahid was detained while catching a plane to Kabul
 vah afghanistan jaakar aies main shaamil hone vaali thi
 NIA investigation has proved that Abdul Rashid Abdullah is the main conspirator in this case
 isane kasargod ke kai yuvaaon ko parivaar sahit bharat chhodkarislamic statemen shaamil hone ke liye prerit kiya tha
 He used to organize classes in Kasragod and other places in support of this terrorist organization and its ideology

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday intensified its attack on the coal block allocation issue, again targeting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal
 party ne sabhi koyala aavantnon ko radd karne or kendriya satarkta ayog (sivisi) kii nigaraanee main gathit vishesh jaanch dal se isaki jaanch karne kii maang kii
 BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said, "it is very surprising that his brothers became big businessmen after the ministers in the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government became ministers
" 'prasad kendriya paryaton mantri subodh kaant sahay or purv koyala mantri santosh bagadodiya ke sambandh main haal main hue khulaason ke sandarbh main bol rahe the
 Sahay wrote a letter to the Prime Minister for the allocation of coal blocks to his brother's company, while the Bagdodia family had a 10 per cent stake in the coal mine allocated to a joint venture by the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC)
 unhone kaha ki isaki jaanch honi chahie ki kaise 26000 karod rupee kaa koyala khadaan qaraar us sanyukt upkram ko diya gaya jisamen bagadodiya parivaar kii hissedari he
 Prasad said that coal blocks were allocated to many companies who hid the truth and who did not deserve it
 unhone maang kii ki sabhi 142 koyala block aavantnon ko radd kiya jaae or kendriya satarkta ayog (sivisi) kii nigaraanee main gathit vishesh jaanch dal se isaki jaanch karai jaae
 He said, 'prime Minister was signing all these agreements as Coal Minister
 antim aavanton tabhi hota he jab mantri hastakshar karata he
 Did you check before doing this
 ' BJP national president Rajnath Singh, who is trying to reach Parliament with the legacy of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) veteran Atal Bihari Vajpayee, is caught in the trap of Brahmin and Muslim equations
 raajnneetik vishleshkon or jaankaron kii maane to philhal ke sameekaran rajnath ke khilaaf hi dikhaai de rahe hai, kyonki brahmanon kaa vot yadi bhaajapa se khiskaa to rajnath kii haar lagbhag tay he
 Opponents in the UP capital have laid siege to the national president of the BJP, Rajnath
 bahujan samaaj party (basapa) kii ore se nakul doobe, samaajawaadee party (sapa) kii ore se abhishek mishra or congress kii ore se purv pradesh adhyaksh reeta bahuguna joshi maidan main hai
 Congress leader Joshi had given a tough fight to BJP candidate Lalji Tandon in the 2009 general election and lost the election by around 40 thousand votes
 is baar vah koi kor kasar nahin chhodana chahengi
 Equations have been made in the capital so much that Rajnath will have to walk around the streets of the capital, otherwise Rajnath will have to face his mouth in the fort of Atal
 aankadon kii baat karen to rajdhani main brahman matadaataaon kii sankhya teen lakh he
 There are one and a half lakh hill voters and in addition the number of Muslim voters is around four lakhs
 thakur matadaataaon kii sankhya mahaj 60 hajaar ke aasapaas hi he or kshatriyon ke sahare lakhanu kii jang jeetna rajnath ke liye aasaan nahin hoga
 Political analysts believe that if a big Muslim face does not come to the ground in Lucknow, then Rita Bahuguna Joshi is likely to hold the upper hand in Lucknow parliamentary seat
 vishleshkon ke mutabik, yadi muslim samudaay se koi ummidavaar nahin aayaa to musalamaanon kaa dhruvikaran usee ke paksh main hoga jo bhaajapa ummidavaar ko haraane kii sthiti main hoga
 Joshi himself belongs to the Brahmin community and is associated with Uttarakhand, so the views of the hill people living in and around Indira Nagar can be joined by him
 reeta ne pichley chunaav main kaint vidhansabha main tandon ko bhi shikast di thi
 Apart from this, the Brahmin community of Lucknow is angry with Rajnath because of Kalraj Mishra being sent to Deoria
 tandon kaa tikat katane ke baad se party pehle hi sthaneey str par antarkalah se jujh rahi he
 In this sense, the road to Rajnath is not going to be easy
 lakhanu main abhishek mishra ko maidan main utarkar sapa pramukh ne rajnath kaa rasta pehle hi saaf kar diya he
 Ashok Vajpayee was working day and night for the last year and a half, but with the announcement of Rajnath's candidature, the SP changed the candidate here
 aisi atakalein hai ki rajnath kii raah aasaan banane ke liye hi sapa kii ore se yah kavayad kii gai he
 Given the current equation, the key to victory in the Lucknow parliamentary seat in this election is going to be with the Muslims
 yadi koi muslim cheharaa maidan main nahi utraa to musalamaanon kaa dhruvikaran joshi ke paksh main hona lagbhag tay he or aisi sthiti main rajnath ke mansoobon par pani phir saktaa he
 Senior Lucknow-based journalist and political analyst Sharat Pradhan also admits that Rita Bahuguna's candidature is looking strong at the moment
 unhone kaha, 'lakhanu main mulaayam singh ne rajnath ke liye maidan khulaa chhod diya he
 Changing the candidate within 24 hours of Rajnath's candidature indicates that he has given a safe passage to Rajnath
 ' pradhan ne kaha ki abhishek mishra kii sthiti ashok vaajapeyi ke kad vaali nahin he
