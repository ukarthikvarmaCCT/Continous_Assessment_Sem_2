 itihaas ke pannon ko palatakar dekhen to samaaj main mahilaon ke yogadan ko sadaiv purushon kii tulana main kam hi aanka gaya he
 However, despite this discriminatory view, neither the ability of women can be questioned nor the importance of their contribution diminished
 bhartiya itihaas main aaazaad hind sena kii regiment commander lakshmi sahagal se lekar kalpana chawla tak ne mahilaon kii chhavi ko logon ke saamne badalakar rakh diya he
 The sad thing is that even today, women who have achieved all the achievements on their own have to face discrimination more often than men, not only in India but around the world

 Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said that Pakistan's treatment of Jadhav's family cannot be tolerated
 pakistan kii sena, pakistan sarkaar se desh or desh ke log sab waakif hai
 The way Pakistan has treated Jadhav's family is an insult not only to them but to the 130 crore people of the country

 Our views may be different, but we are united on the matter of the country

 The dealings with the Jadhav family, getting Mangalasutra, removing Bindi, removing shoes is an insult to the country
 pakistan ne jis tarah jadhav parivaar ke saath vyavhaar kiya he, use bardaasht nahin ja saktaa he
 Pakistan is less condemned for this
 unhone kaha ki pakistan ko hamaari sarkaar ko bharosa dilaanaa chahie ki jab tak jadhav unki jail main he uski hifaazat karne kaa aashwaasan dena chahie
 Pakistan has made false allegations against Jadhav

 It is a matter of regret that he behaved this way during the meeting
 sushamaa ne kaha ki pakistan ne is mulaakaat ko propaganda banaaya
 Jadhav's mother wears only saris, her clothes were also changed
 media ko maa or patni ke najadik aane diya gaya, jo hamaari sharton ke khilaaf tha
 After returning from the meeting, the mother-wife said that Kulbhushan is under pressure
 unke kaid karne waalon ne jo unhen bolne ke liye kaha tha jadhav sirf vahi bol rahe the
 Pakistan can do some mischief with Jadhav's mother-wife shoes
 is meeting main sirf maanavadhikaar ke niyamon kaa ulanghan hi hua he
 Before going to Pakistan, mother and wife were checked in two places at the airport, so when no chip was seen
 puraa sadan pakistan ke is vyavhaar kii ninda karata he
 Kulbhushan saw his mother first and asked how Baba is because as soon as he saw the mother without Mangalsutra and Bangle, he suspected that something inauspicious had happened
 kulbhushan ne sabase pehla sawaal poocha ki baba kaise hai
 Sushma said that the two lovers were presented as a widow

 In this connection, some family members applied for a loan to buy equipment for sugarcane harvesting
 ye yantra kaaphi mahange hote hai or bank se lone ke liye kuch sharten hai jaise ki pachchis acre zamin kaa hona ityadi zaruri he
 Deshmukh family's loan was also approved
 parivaar ke kuch log jaise ki amit or ritesh kii maa ne lone liya to vahiin in donon bhaaiyon ne lone nahin liya
 Bank chairman Sripath Rao Kakade said, “some family members applied for the loan
 amit or ritesh kii maa ne sabase pehle lone liya tha lekin uske baad in logon ne lone nahin liya kyonki in logon ne bolaa ki ye lone bahut baari pad rahaa tha
 Because it was infected with the loan bank, it was visible in the land record
 amit or ritesh kii maa ne apana karz puraa waapas kar diya or in logon ne lone nahin liya
 "the letter from the bank was written to the Tehsildar's office at that time, it is with Aaj Tak
 tehseeldaar ke daftar ne bhi nae land record main badlaav ho jane kii baat kahi he lekin ye ab tak online main dikh nahin rahaa he
 Amit Deshmukh said on this issue, "we have not taken this loan, so why is it being discussed?" ye galat he
 "it is obvious that if there is a debt or not, then debt waiver is not going to happen

 Thackeray had said that Tendulkar "has left the crease and has come to the political pitch" through his remarks

 In fact, the Finance Minister has announced the construction of a tunnel at Sela Pass at a height of 13,700 feet for rapid movement of troops at Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh
 sarkaar ne yah prastaav aise samay laayaa he, jab doklam ko lekar china or bharat ke bich tanaav chal he
 Please tell that Sela Pass is a mountain pass on the border between Tawang and West Kameng districts
 is darre ko lambey samay se china dakshin tibet kaa hissaa bataata rahaa he
 Because of this, there is a dispute between the two countries about this
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki sela darra banane se china seemaa par sainikon ko tainaat karne main aasaani hogi
 Apart from this, tourism will also get a boost
 sabase pehle sela darra tab surkiyon main aayaa tha jab 1962 ke yuddh ke dauraan chini sainik is darre ke jariye bharat main ghus aae the
 However, now Indian soldiers are tightly guarded here

 com / a8lbprvi75 — Ellen mcnamara (@ ellenkctv5) September 10, 2017 alvar jile ke ek gaanv sherpur main ek dharmanirpeksh dharmasthal laldaas ab rajasthan main sampradayik tanaav kaa nayaa centre ban gaya he
 The village is 22 km from Gopalgarh, where 10 Meo Muslims were killed in the police firing on the mosque in September last year
 do sau gadiyon main ai rajasthan police ne 10 july ko kareeb do darjan gharon vaale is chote se gaanv ko teen din tak chhavnee banaae rakhaa
 "this was done to prevent an attempt to stop the namaz and remove Hindu symbols," says Jaipur (rural) Inspector General of Police Saurabh Srivastava, who led the operation
 ''yah dharmasthal sant laldaas kii kabr ke chaaron ore bani deevaaron kaa ek parisar he
 Born in 1597, Saint Laldas was the child of Muslim Meo parents and founded the Laldasi sect
 is dharmasthal main musalmaan or hindu donon aate hai, or iskaa prabandhan hinduon kii ek samiti karti he
 Idris Saad, a middle-aged Meo Muslim, is its priest
 yah dharmasthal mewan ke garh alvar main sthit he, jo kendriya grih rajya mantri bhavar jitendra singh kaa chunaav kshetra he
 The complex houses dozens of graves of Laldas, the founder of the Laldasi Panth, some of his offspring and members of his family
 alvar ke tatkaaleen bandobast adhikari major pi
 W
 polet ne alvar gajet main likhaa he ki laldaas janm se ek mev musalmaan the, jo hindu reeti-rivaajon ko maanate the
 His Laldasi sect was like the Kabir Panth and was far more liberal than any other sect of its kind
 aaj is sampradaay kii alvar main satraa ghoshit sampattiyaan hai or 30 anya sampattiyaan uttari, madhya bharat main hai
 The Meo community of Rajasthan, converted from Hindu to Muslim, is tolerant and secular, which has been flourishing for many years with very close cultural ties with Hindus
 lekin gopalgarh hinsa se mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ke thik dhang se na nipatane or uske baad lekhak salmaan rushdi ko jaipur sahitya mahotsav main shaamil na hone dekar kattarpanthi musalamaanon kaa tushtikaran karne se kshetra main kattarpanthi guton ko sampradayik bhavanaaen bhadakaane ko protsaahan mila he
 Srivastava says, "we have avoided a situation like Gopalgarh
 sadbhaavna manch ke binar tale prastaavit baithak ke aayojak sampradayik hai or unhen tabaligi jamaat jaise kattarpanthi guton kaa samarthan praapt he
 They have both Hindu and Muslim leaders who were at the root of the Gopalgarh crisis
 '' police ne sadbhaavna manch ke do netaaon-pipuls union ov civil liberties (piusiel) ke upaadhyaksh moulana hanif or dalit kaaryakarta surajmal kardam-ke khilaaf dharmik bhaawanaaon ko chot pahunchane, vidwesh or dangon ko badhaava dene jaise gaiyr-jamaanti aparaadhon ke liye praathmiki darj kii he
 Hanif told India Today on 15 July from his hiding place: "we were going to have a huge meeting near the campus on 11 July to protest against the installation of idols on the campus on 12 June
 iske liye prashasan se anumati maangi gai thi
 Leaders like Swami Agnivesh, Ram Vilas Paswan and Udit Raj had approved to come there
 ham hinduon or musalamaanon kaa shantipurna sashastitv chaahate hai, jisamen musalamaanon ko vahaan namaaj padhane kii anumati ho
 According to the local administration, all historical records show that Namaz was never read there
 lihaaja manch kii maang sampradayik sadbhaav bigaadane jaisi he
 On 15 July India Today did not find any idols of Hindu deities there
 rajasthan piusiel kii mahasachiv kavita shrivastav ne 15 july kii der shaam ko jari kii gai ek press vijyapti main kaha ki laldaas dharmasthal par vivaad keval is baithak ko radd karne kii ek sarkari chaal thi, jisamen gopalgarh narsanhaar par charchaa honi thi, isse sarkaar ko sharmindagi kaa saamana karnaa padataa
 Idris states that "the whole controversy is a government trick, which aims to bring the shrine under its control to appease the hardliners from the Meo
" ''majaar par jis tarah saare bhakt chadar, tel, agarbatti, chini or chaaval chadhaate hai, usase dharmasthal kaa khaas charitra saaf najar aata he, lekin hindu maathaa tekte hai or parikrama karte hai, jo musalmaan nahin karte
 Till now nobody has objected to how someone worships there
 baba laldaas mandir vikaas samiti ke adhyaksh ravi kapur jor dekar kehete hai ki sadbhaavna manch gopalgarh main musalamaanon par hue atyaachaar kaa istemaal karke unki bhavanaaen bhadakaane kii chaal chal rahaa he
 The intention is to take possession of this shrine, as the amount of donations and offerings has increased to Rs 15 lakh in the last few years
 salanaa ho chuki he
 Idris says that at one time he had to beg for oil to light a lamp
 ve kehete hai, ''shraddhalu aate the, lekin un dinon ve chadhaava nahin chadhaate the
 Now we are getting many drum oils, that's why there are many contenders
 '' india today kii team ne paaya ki sherpur main or uske aasapaas ke ilaake main logon ne dharmasthal ko alag-alag naamon se pukarana shuru kar diya he, jo unke nihit swaarthon ke lihaaj se hai
 Such as Samadhi, Temple, Idgah, Mazar or Dargah
 unhone sant kaa naam bhi vivaadit kar diya haih laldaas yaa laal khan?muslim guton ne ateet main bhi is par kabja karne kii koshish kii thi
 In 1945, some Muslims filed a case in the court stating that they should be allowed to offer Namaz and Muslim rites in the premises
 lekin aktubar 1947 main unke maamle ko alvar ke munsif magistrate ne yah kahkar khaarij kar diya tha ki kabir panth kii tarah laladaasi na hindu the, na hi musalmaan
 He was close to the Vaishnavas
 unhone aadesh diya ki vahaan kisi islamic chinh kii yaa namaaj ata karne kii anumati nahin di jaaegi
 a trust was formed in 1966 to take care of the place, mostly Hindus
 trust main sthaneey mev kaa sahyog liya jaataa tha
 In 1986, a group of Meo Muslims performed namaz after a nikah on a platform that looked like Idgah situated on the campus
 uske baad us samay ke pujari ko nikaal diya gaya tha
 Idris was replaced
 hindu bhakton kii sankhya badhati gai
 In 2001, a radical group of Hindus from village Naugaon, just two km away, took over the management of the trust
 unhone parisar ke andar tuuti-phooti jhepadiyon main rahane vaale aath mev or do hindu pariwaron se baatcheet kii ki ve paise or jameen le len or parisar ke thik baahar pakke makaan banavaa len, taaki shraddhaluon ke liye jagah nikaali ja sake
 He developed kitchen, canteen and lodging facilities for the devotees
 ab teen pramukh melon main bhakton kii sankhya har baar do lakh se adhik ho jaati he
 The money started getting more from this, but the local Meo became isolated from it, which started to feel disconnected from its economic development
 89 varsh ke sallu, jo 2008 main is parisar se baahar shift ho gaye the or jinhone baahar ek vishaal makaan banavaa liya he, yahaan puja karne kaa adhikaar apane bhattije idris ko de dene ko lekar pareshaan hai
 In a court case against a rival Meo once over the right to worship, Sallu claimed that he was a descendant and non-muslim of Laldas and believed in his way of worship
 ab unka sara gussa hindu varchasv vaale prabandhan par he
 Their demand is, "there was namaz here and should be on the first floor
 '' is dharmasthal kii khaasiyat hi ab khatre main aa gai he
 There is hardly any escape from the glitter of the glamor world
 glamer kii duniya kii chakachaundh se koi field nahin batch pai he, yahi vajah he ki 2015 ke 'miss india' kii res main is baar model ke alaavaaijineering, medical or soshal work ke kshetron main kaam karne vaali bhi shaamil hai
 a total of 21 participants are taking part in this competition
 is pratiyogita main hissaa lene vaali mumbai kii apeksha porwal ek soshal varkar hai to vahiin, lakhanu kii vartika kansaltent or aakanksha gautam doctor hai
 Apart from medical and engineering students in this contest, Roushali Raj is a national level basketball and badminton player
 rushaali aatma ram sanathan dharm college se padhai kar rahi hai
 According to Hindu scriptures, the beginning of Satyuga and Tretayuga is considered to be the beginning of Akshaya Tritiya
 bataa den, maa matangi devi or bhagwaan parashuram kaa avataran bhi akshay tritiya ko hi hua tha
 The special thing is that Lord Vishnu also took the incarnation of Hayagreeva and nara-narayana on this date
 yahi vajah he ki yah tithi bhartiya samskruti kii sarvottam muhoort kaa nirmaan karti he
 All the work done in Abuja Muhurta of Akshaya Tritiya gets business resolution completed
 jyotishacharya pandit arunesh kumaar sharma kii maane to is baar akshay tritiya par budhaditya yoga ke saath surya chandra or shukr kaa utch raashiyon main hona vishesh faldaayi yoga banaata he
 The auspicious time of worship on the day of Akshaya Tritiya is the time of special worship and ritualistic Muhurta on the day of Akshaya Tritiya from morning sunrise to 12: 35 in the afternoon
 suryoday kaa samay apane-apane shahar ke anusaar dekh len
 For example, the sunrise time in New Delhi on May 7, 2019 is 5
36 am
 akshay tritiya ke dinmangal kaary ke liye shubh muhurdakshay tritiya ke din keemtee vastuon ke kray-vikray or vibhinn mangalik kaaryon ko karne ke liye suryoday se raatri 2 bajkar 16 minute tak kaa samay he
 Akshaya Tritiya is Abuja Muhurat
 vivaahadi mangalik kaaryon ko karne ke liye yah din vishesh shubh mana jaataa he
 Equipment installation done on this day remains stable for a long time
 is din liye gaye sabhi sankalp purna hote hai
 The special thing is that the donations made on this day remain intact
 ullekhneey he ki jaise dakshin bharat main tirupati mandir mundan ke liye prasiddh he, usee tarah uttar bharat main chintapoorni mandir mundan ke liye hinduon main behad vikhyath he
 Last year, more than 40 lakh devotees visited the Goddess of this temple

 — taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh)june 4, 2018 Union Minister Nitin Gadkari has said that caste politics is in every party, but BJP never does politics by making caste an issue
 aaj tak ke khaas kaarykram 'manthan'main nitin gadakari ne kaha, 'narendra modi ne gujarat main apane lambey kaarykaal ke dauraan kabhi bhi jati ko mudda nahin banaaya
 BJP also never discussed caste in Lok Sabha elections

 Questioned about secularism, Nitin Gadkari lashed out at the leaders of his rival parties over the talk of secularism
 gadakari ne tanj kasate hue kaha, 'musalamaanon ke saath yadavon kaa vot lene kii koshish karne vaale lalu secular hai
 Mulayam Singh, who does politics in the name of Muslims, is secular

 Sarvadharma is a person with a sense of equality

 "sakshi Maharaj's speaking is not a party line" On the persistent rhetoric of BJP mps, Gadkari said, "sakshi Maharaj's speaking cannot be considered a party line

 Plastic is being made in India with an increase of 10 per cent annually
 kendriya pradooshan niyantran board ke 2016 ke anumaanon ke mutabik, roj 15,000 ton plastic kaa kachra paidaa hota he, jisamen se 9,000 ton ikattha karke proces kiya jaataa he, jabaki baaki 6,000 ton aam taur par naaliyon or sadakon par gandagi failaane ke liye chhod diya jaataa he yaa landphil yani kachra jamaa karne vaale sthalon par paat diya jaataa he
 About 8 million tonnes of plastic reaches the seas every year and poses a threat to marine life

 Manufacturers have to take responsibility
 It is common opinion that to deal with this problem, a top-down approach should be adopted and those who make plastics are the ones who should break this vicious cycle in the future
 mishra kehete hai, ''ekstended produsar risponsibility yaa eepiaar yani banane waalon par yah atirikt jimmedaari daalana acchhee avadharana he, kyonki mushkil yah he ki ham isse nibatane ke liye ekajute niti aakhir kaise banaaen

 The Committee of Administrators (COA) on Wednesday demanded the removal of BCCI acting president CK Khanna, secretary Amitabh Chaudhary and treasurer Anirudh Chaudhary for deliberately not following the orders of the Supreme Court
 supreme court main in teen adhikariyon ke kaamkaaj kaa lekha-jokha pesh kiya gaya he

 He was dismissed for failing to implement reforms to the Lodha Committee
 report ke mutabik, yah sahi hoga ki maujuuda padaadhikariyon ke saath usee tarah kaa vyavhaar kiya jaae jaise ki pehle ke adhikariyon se kiya gaya tha, kyonki in adhikariyon ne jo shapath patr diya tha uske baad atirikt chah maheene biit jane ke baad bhi court ke nirdeshon ke anusaar sudhaaron ko lagu nahin kiya gaya
 It is clear from this that the incumbent is not in a position to get the court's instructions implemented

 They believe that terrorists come from UP Bihar and carry out bombings in Mumbai
 gaye saal 13 july ke mumbai dhamaake ko kuch aaropee bihar se hai ye baat saamne aane par raaj ne bayaan diya he
 By the way, Raj's rhetoric is also being called a trick to create votes in municipal elections
 maharashtra main apane chachaa ke khilaaf uttar bhartiya virodh kii baisakhiyon par ghist rahe hai raaj thakare
 In the municipal elections, they are flirting against the Shiv Sena to win
 raaj kii aisi ek chatapataahat he uttar bharatiyon ko aatanki sabit karne kii koshish
 An attempt to prove Bihar and UP as a base of terror
 raaj kaa kahana he, 'mumbai,maharashtra or desh ke duusare kone main hone vaale dhamaakon ko dekho
 Where are these terrorists coming from? aatanki upi or bihar se aa rahe hai
 up-bihar state governments should investigate this but they do nothing
 jab bhi chunaav hota he mumbai se vaahan chori hote hai
 But who and what they are being used for should be investigated
 mumbai police ko ham naahak dosha dete hai
 In this statement of Raj Thackeray, there are many allegations on UP Bihar and an attempt to save the Maharashtra Police
 khud ko rajaneta kehane vaala shaks agar aisi baaten kahata he to sochna lajimi he ki kya wo is bhoomika ke liye sahi he
 Raj has further said, 'where is the center of terror
 kahaan par aatanki sajishein banati hai
 It all happens in Bihar
 sajeesh vahaan banati he or dhamaakaa mumbai main hota he

 In his statement, Raj Thackeray further says, 'when i said that malaria is spreading due to external laborers in Mumbai, i was called wrong

 JDU chief Sharad Yadav, who holds power in Bihar, is also angry with Raj's statement

 Politics cannot be at stake for the unity and integrity of the country for election betting

 gujarat ke purv mantri amit shah ko ishrat jahaan farji encounter cese main badi raahat mil sakati he
 According to sources, the CBI investigating the case has not made Amit Shah an accused in the supplementary charge sheet
 ishrat jahaan muthbhed maamle main amit shah kii bhoomika ke sawaal par sibiai ke senior adhikariyon ne saaf kiya ki kanoonee taur par aise tarksangat saboot nahin hai, jinke aadhaar par unhen chargeshit main aaropee ke taur par namit kiya jaae
 Sources said Amit Shah's name cropped up after one of the main accused DG Vanzara claimed that the former minister had cheated him and other police officers against whom the CBI had registered a case in various encounter cases
 sibiai ne haal main ishrat jahaan muthbhed maamle main bijepi mahasachiv amit shah se poochtacha kii thi
 Later, the CBI issued a statement saying that no final decision has been taken on the supplementary charge sheet of the Ishrat Jahan encounter case
 sibiai pravaktaa kanchan prasad ne kaha ki supplementary chargeshit pesh karne ko lekar ab tak koi antim faisla nahin hua he
 This matter is still under consideration
 isse pehle, ishrat maamle main supplementary chargeshit ko antim rup die jane ke bich sibiai ne kanoon mantralay se raay maangi
 The CBI asked whether the sanction needed for prosecution against intelligence department officials in the conspiracy not to nominate Amit Shah, an aide of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 sibiai sutron ne kaha ki unhone muthbhed ke peeche kii sajeesh main ibi adhikariyon kii bhoomika ke bare main paryaapt saboot jutaaye hai, lekin is baat ko lekar virodhabhasi vichaar hai ki vishesh nideshak rajendra kumaar (ab sevanivrutt) or teen anya adhikari pi mittal, emke sinha or rajeev vankhede ke khilaaf abhiyojan ke liye grih mantralay kii manjuuri kii jarurat he yaa nahin
 He said one view is that since Kumar was actively in service at the time of the alleged crime, approval from the Ministry of Home Affairs for prosecution against him is needed
 sutron ne kaha ki ek anya raay yah he ki chunki ve is saal july main ritair ho chuke hai, to agency abhiyojan ke liye manjuuri maange bagaiyr apane aaropapatr ke saath aage bad sakati he
 He said that the agency cannot proceed with the half-hearted situation, so it has been referred to the Law Ministry for clarity in the matter
 sutron ne kaha ki kathith sajeesh main jahaan tak adhikariyon kii bhoomika kii baat he, agency ne unke khilaaf paryaapt saboot juta liye hai
 He said that if the Law Ministry feels that the approval of the Ministry of Home Affairs is needed before filing a supplementary charge sheet, then the CBI can request for approval of prosecution against the alleged officers
 haalanki agar mantralay ko iske ulat lagata he, to agency apane supplementary chargeshit ke saath aage badhegi

 Till now, you must have seen pictures of vicious criminals and criminal criminals on the notice boards of almost every police station in the country, but now police photos will also be seen in the police stations of Bhopal division of Madhya Pradesh
 ye tasviren acha or bura kaam karne vaale police javaanon kii hongi
 This experiment is being used to discourage the soldiers doing bad work and to encourage the good soldiers
 bhopal sambhag main bhopal ke alaava rajgad, sihor tathaa vidisha jile aate hai
 In order to change the way the soldiers of these districts work, the police officers have decided to conduct innovative experiments
 is prayog ke tahat har thane se ek acha or ek bura police jawan chunaa jayega
 Bhopal Deputy Commissioner of Police, Raman Singh Sikarwar said that this scheme has been prepared to encourage police personnel
 iske tahat sabase pehle krime and crimanal teking network and system (sisitianes) ke javaanon par hi yah abhinav prayog kiya jayega
 According to DIG Sikarwar, each police station will select one good and one bad police personnel every month in terms of work, this will be done by the in-charge of the concerned police station, the city and additional superintendent of police of that area
 chaynit jawan kii tasviir soochna patal par lagegi, saath hi uskaa naam or kaam donon us par darj rahenge
 He further explained that the purpose of this experiment is to encourage and do good work to young men and discourage those who do bad things

 badal ne kathith taur par logon se yah bhi kaha tha ki ve prachaar ke liye gupt tareeke se dhan den
 Believing that Badal had violated the Code of Conduct prima facie, the Commission has asked him to clarify his alleged statement by the evening of 2 May
 yadi badal ne 2 may kii shaam tak jawaab daakhil nahin kiya to ayog unhen soochna die bagaiyr karrwai karegaa
 Acting on the complaint of a Punjab Congress leader, the commission said that the model code of conduct is clear that 'all parties and candidates will abstain from activities that are corrupt and are an offense under electoral law
 
 
 ' On April 12, Badal reportedly made a statement in Jalandhar that "crores of rupees are spent on publicity, while we give very little information about our expenditure
" 
 Give it secretly, not openly
 ' The Commission also reminded Badal of Section 77 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, under which all candidates have to give accurate information about the expenditure incurred in connection with the election

 Vikram Bhatt says, "when i wrote the story of this film, then i gave it this name
 is film ko yah naam dene kaa ek makasad yah bhi tha ki isse logon ko kahin bhi horer film kaa ishaara nahin milegaa or mere liye yah sabase jaruri baat thi
 When i came to know that Shirish has registered this name in his name, i met his wife Farah Khan, who is my good friend
 jab maine unase baat kii to mujhe pataa chalaa ki shiris khud is naam kii film par kaam kar rahe hai
 i backtracked
 "film ko ‘krichar’ naam dene main sabase badi bhoomika vikram bhatta kii beti krishna ne nibhaai he
 Vikram explains, "it is obvious that when Shirish refused to give me this title, i could not think what to name it
 usee dauraan meri beti krishna ne mujhe ‘krichar’ naam sujhaayaa
 i thought i got what i wanted
 sach kahuun to mujhe nahin lagata is naam se behatar koi or naam is film ke upyukt hota
 "in this connection, producer Bhushan Kumar also says the same," Vikram wanted the name 'animal' for this film, but i think 'creator 3D' is the perfect title for this film

 Various sanitation programs have been going on in India for years and all of them have also promised to rid the country of open defecation
 lekin taaja aankade to kuch or hi ishaara kar rahe hai
 These figures show that much of the taxpayers' money the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has spent to deal with this problem has flowed into the missing toilets
 2011 kii janaganana se lagata he ki bharat ke do tihaai se adhik gaanvon main pariwaron ke liye alag shauchalay (iechaechael) uplabdh nahin he
 The results of the latest survey of the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation are also no different
 is survey se bhi yahi pataa chalata he ki bharat ke kareeb 60 fisadi gaanvon main gharon ke bheetar shauchalay nahin he
 The central government has been providing funds to build toilets in villages since 1999
 is dhan se ab tak 9 karod 73 lakh shauchalay banane kaa daawa kiya gaya he, lekin peyajal or swatchta mantralay ke 2012 ke surveykshan se pataa chalata he ki inamen se kam-se-kam 2
 764 crore toilets do not exist on the actual land and 1
 415 karod shauchalay bekaar pade hue hai, jinka istemaal karnaa mumkin nahin he
 This simply means that 4
 179 karod se adhik shauchalayon ke nirmaan par jo bhi paisa kharch hua, usase shauchalay banane kaa lakshya sarkari filon main bhale puraa ho gaya ho, lekin ise banane kaa makasad puraa nahin hua he
 Union Rural Development Minister Nitin Gadkari admitted on 25 August at a conference of state ministers, "the truth is that some of these toilets have become godowns
 " is sammelan se pradhanmantri narendra modi ke mahatvapurn 'svachh bharat mishan' kaa khaakaa taiyaar karne main madad mili
 The impact of this failure of toilet construction is visible in all the villages of the country
 bihar ke navada jile main nirmalavigha naam kaa ek gaanv he
 About 1,400 families of this village are still forced to defecate in the open as no toilet is available to anyone except the families of Sarpanch and his two supporters
 sthaneey nivasee 65 varshiya tanik maanjhi kehete hai, ''sarkaar ne kareeb 100 dalit pariwaron main shauchalay banawaye, lekin ve 100 din bhi nahin chale
 They have no roof and no door
 shauchalayon kii gaharaai bhi sirf do se teen foot he
 The walls were so weak that it collapsed in the first rain
 "sarkaar kaa anumaan he ki svachh bharat mishan ke tahat khule main shouch ko puri tarah khatm karne kaa lakshya hasil karne ke liye agle paanch saal main kareeb 11
 1 crore new IHHL will have to be built
 mantralay ne is dauraan shauchalay banane ke liye madad paane yogya kareeb 8
 84 crore families have also been identified
 matlab sarkaar ke paise se har saal 177 lakh shauchalay banane honge
 Then somewhere, by October 2, 2019, this target will be completed in five years
 iskaa arth he ki sarkaar ko rojaanaa kareeb 50,000 shauchalay banavaane honge
 Simultaneously, the Ministry of Urban Development is also 1 for urban households in more than 4,000 designated towns
 04 karod shauchalay or banvaanaa chahta he
 In this way the figure of total toilets will increase further
 yah kaam kitna bada he, iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki pichley vitt varsh main sarkaar gaanvon main sirf 50 lakh iechaechael hi banavaa saki
 Record of most toilets built in a year, 1 in the year 2009-10
 24 karod shauchalayon kaa tha, jo nae sanshodhit lakshya se bahut kam he
 Each of these for building toilets is Rs 12,000
 kii sahaayta kaa vaada kiya gaya he
 Therefore, if properly done, the government will get about one lakh crore rupees in the next five years on the Swachh Bharat Mission in the villages
 kharch karne padenge
 75,000 crores out of this
 kendrr sarkaar degi or baaki hissaa rajya sarkaron ke bich baraabar baanta jayega
 For the cities of India, the cabinet has spent Rs 62,000 crore over the next five years
 se adhik ke kharch kaa anumaan lagaaya he
 Most of this burden will be borne by the state governments through public-private partnership
 buniyadi suvidhaon kii vyavastha karne ke saath-saath svachh bharat mishan swatchta ke prati bharat ke logon kaa najariya badalanaa chahta he
 The government wants to launch a people's movement to change people's thinking towards cleanliness and open defecation
 is kaam se jude ek adhikari kehete hai, ''hamaara iraadaa gaanv ke logon main sharmindagi or asweekruti kaa bhav paidaa karne kaa he taaki kaam karne laayak shauchalayon kii maang paidaa ho sake
 Only when this happens, India can be clean by 2019

 Amit Shah said that more than 45 lakh people are being given the benefit of healthcare at the doorstep
 shah ne kaha ki saal 2004-14 ke bich congress ko centre main 10 saal sarkaar chalaane kaa mauka mila
 In the 13th Finance Commission, Congress had given only 55,200 crore rupees to Jharkhand, but Modi ji worked to give 1,45,345 crores to Jharkhand in 14th Finance Commission
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri ne anuchhed 370 hataakar kashmir ko bharat kaa abhinn ang banaaya to vipakshiyon ko pareshaani hone lagi
 Congress, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha has voted against it in Parliament
 unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi spasht karen ki ve 370 hataane ke paksh main hai yaa virodh main? shah ne kaha ki ab jharkhand kii janata ko tay karnaa he ki modi ji jinhone anuchhed 370 or 35A hataaya he, unke saath rahanaa he yaa jinhen anuchhed 370 chahie unke saath rahanaa he

 After the performance of 71-year-old Astad Debu at the Serendipity Festival in Goa, another big Indian classical dancer had made a mockery of his low and narrow minded contemporaries for not accepting his genius
 is dancer ne kaha tha, "shreshthatavaadi khud apni kabr khod rahe hai, (debu) nayaa muhaavara gande vaale shakchas hai
 "recently, while singing the Debu with the Yagyarman Living Legend Award, the Krishna Gana Sabha had said something similar
 kalaon ko samarpit sansthaaon ko chahie ki ve parampara jivit rakhane ko punarvyakhyaaon ko samarthan den
 Awards are not new for Debu

 ve kehete hai, "yah vaaki kuch khaas he, dance, theatre or photography kaa mail, jo 1970 or 1980 ke dashakon kii meri record nahin kii gai koreography kii jhalkiyaan dikhaata he
 The thing that looks challenging and good is how much i remember my own body at that time
 kitna main jas kaa tas phir se pesh kar saktaa hum
 Although the idea of presenting his overview to a domestic audience fills him with great enthusiasm, it is difficult for Debu to hide his frustration and despair about the pathetic condition of contemporary dance in India
 ve kehete hai, "bahut kam clasical dancer yahaan gujaarey laayak kama sakate hai
 It is even more difficult to survive as a contemporary dancer
 ''ve yaad karte hai ki tokyo kii sadakon par mili ek bade japani nrity sameekshak unhen baar-baar living lijend pukaarte rahe the
 "I did not understand how to react
 In my 48 years as a dancer, in my country i was still struggling for grants and commissioned work

 Petrol-diesel prices have reached an all-time high since 2014
 mumbai main jahaan log 79 rupye main petrol kharid rahe hai, to dilli main 1 litre petrol kii keemat 70 rupye he
 The continuous increase in the prices of petrol and diesel is astonishing to the common people, because the international crude oil prices have been continuously falling
 kachche tel kii keemton main ai he kamiantararashtriya str par kachche tel kii keemten pichley teen saal ke dauraan 50 fisadi se zyada kam ho gai hai, lekin isi dauraan bharat main lagaataar petrol-dijal kii keemton main ijapha dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 On September 13, the price of crude oil in the international market is Rs 3093 per barrel
 2014 main ek bairal kachche tel kii keemat 6 hajaar rupye ke kareeb thi
 Customers have not benefited from the decrease in the price of crude oil in the last three years
 ye bhi padhein : jab bhi book karen gas silendar or bharwaayen petrol, aise hameshaa paaen discountaise 31 rupye main taiyaar hota he petrolindian oil, hindustan petroleum or bharat petroleum kachche tel ko ripine karti hai
 According to a report by Catch News, these companies 21 for one liter of crude oil
 50 rupye kaa bhugtan karti hai
 After this, if you combine entry tax, refinery processing, landing cost and other operational costs, then refining one liter of crude oil 9
 34 rupye kharch hote hai
 This means that oil companies cost about Rs 31 to prepare one liter of petrol
 aise main aaj aap agar 1 litre petrol ke liye 79 rupye tak bhar rahe hai, to iske liye in par vusla jane vaala tex jimmedaar he
 That's why you are not getting the benefit
 At the level of oil companies, 1 liter of petrol gets ready for 31 rupees
 iske baad us par centre sarkaar kii taraf se tex vasula jaataa he
 This means that you are paying more than 48 rupees only tax
 saal 2014 se ab tak centre sarkaar ne petrol par exise duty 126 fisadi badha di he
 At the same time, the duty on diesel has increased by 374 percent
 dynemic prising kaa he jorek samay aisa bhi tha jab petrol or dijal kii keemton main 50 paise yaa 1 rupye kii bhi badhottaree ho jaati thi, to hangaamaa ho jaataa tha
 The opposition used to take out a front against it
 lekin aaj keemten teen saal ke sabase oonche str par pahunch gai hai, lekin is taraf kisi kaa dhyaan nahin ja rahaa he
 The reason for this is dynamic pricing
 darasal centre sarkaar ne 16 june ko dynemic prising apanaai thi
 Under this, the prices of petrol and diesel are changed every day
 ye bhi padhein : petrol-dijal kii dianmik prising kaa 'jor kaa jhatka dhire se',sarkaar apana vaada bhul gai?oil ministar dharmendra pradhan ne kaha tha ki roj keemten tay karne kaa phayda aam logon ko milegaa
 He said that the reduction in oil prices in the international market will be immediately accessible to the common citizens
 lekin aisa kahin hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 There has been a steady reduction in the prices of crude oil internationally, but the common people are not getting the benefit of this, in such a situation, the government needs to remember that the promise with which it implemented dynamic pricing in the country, It does not appear to be complete
 aisa main kya yah samajha jaae ki sarkaar apana vaada bhul gai he
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh says that after getting a clean chit by Narendra Modi from the Special Investigation Team in the Gujarat riots case, he no longer needs to take further fire exams and the country is waiting for his national role outside Gujarat

 Now the people of the country are waiting for Modi's national role outside Gujarat
 ’’tippaniyan The mouthpiece of the Sangh states that the publication of a cover story on Modi's work in this world famous magazine of America and counting him among the leading and influential personalities of the world, was forced on him (modi) for his 'anti-muslim villain' The image is a befitting reply

 maharashtra main janadesh gathbandhan ko mila tha lekin shivasena bijepi kaa samarthan karne ko taiyaar nahin he
 Therefore, they cannot form a government
 isse pehle shivasena adhyakshauddhav thakaripane vidhayakon se milane mumbai ke da retreat resort pahunche
 Legislators have been kept here to protect them from horse trading
 in sabake bich, baithak main uddhav thakare ne sanket de diya ki siem kii kursi par koi samjhauta nahin hoga

 Coordination between Shiv sena-congress? As far as Shiv Sena is concerned, it is ready to form government with Congress

 america ke raashtrapati donald trump or uttar korea ke supreme leader kim jong un kii is mulaakaat par puri duniya kii nigaah tiki hui he
 Three thousand journalists have reached Singapore from every corner of the world
 yah mulaakaat isliye kaaphi ahm he, kyonki isse hi tay hoga ki duniya shanti kii raah main aage badhegi yaa parmaanu yuddh kii aag main jhulasegi
 This meeting is considered to be the biggest event of current global politics
 ummid kii ja rahi he ki 12 june itihaas ke pannon main hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye darj ho jayega, kyonki yah pehali baar he, jab uttar korea or america ke sarvocch netaa aamane-saamne aakar baatcheet karne ja rahe hai
 Getting Trump and Kimka to agree to the conversation is nothing short of a miracle, as the two were cursing each other after drinking water a few days ago
 parmaanu batan dabaane kii dhamkee de rahe the
 Both were publicly humiliating each other in a way that is not normally expected from any head of state
 donon dushmano kii umr main bhi kaaphi antar he
 While Trump is 71 years old, Kim's age is half that of him, which is just 34 years
 in sabake baavjood ab puri duniya chaahati he ki 12 june ko hone vaali donon kii mulaakaat khushnuma maahaul main ho or baatcheet se shanti kaa rasta nikle

 Urad production is also less affected due to deficiency and attack of insects
 haalanki is baar saare ganit bekaar gayi
 Even then, the problem was that despite paying the premium to the farmer, the compensation was still not received

 Although an invite to the influential Ambika Soni and co-in-charge Harish Chaudhary was sent to the Delhi Durbar, his absence made sure that the High Command could soon take a decision on Captain's stubbornness

 5) Water crisis will increase in Delhi, the supply of water from Tehri Dam will be faced with shortage of water in the coming days, due to the scorching heat, because the UP Irrigation Department has said that the water from Tehri Dam will get to Delhi

 Demonetization has not only increased the crisis of farmers and laborers, but has also disturbed the factories
 unhen chote-chote bhugtan ke liye zaruri cash nahin mil rahe hai, jisase unke vyapaar par asar pad rahaa he
 Vishwnathji, an exporter of readymade garments, has a readymade garments business in Noida, which has been associated with this business for decades
 vishwanath kehete hai unke kaarobaar par notebandi kaa kaaphi asar pad rahaa he
 He told NDTV, 'those who are sewing-embroidery workers ask for payment in cash
 wo sirf 5-10 din hi ek factory main kaam karte hai
 Daily workers like him have to pay us in cash
 saath hi, export ke liye taiyaar mahange radimaid garments ke liye batan, dhaagaa or chen jaisi choti exsesries bhi cash main kharidni padati hai'
 Vishnath says that the government has set a limit of Rs 50,000 cash withdrawal every week, it is necessary to increase it
 vishwanath kehete hai, "main chahta hum ki sarkaar cash nikaalane kii seemaa 50,000 se rupee badhaakar ek lakh kare
 This is very important
 isse hamaare vyapaar main sankat kam hoga
 Cash flow will improve '
 tippaniyan Actually, this crisis is not limited to readymade Garments sector only

" kai kshetron main mazaduron ke bank acount bhi khole gaye hai, jisase unhen online pement bhi kiya ja sake"
 Sahay believes that the impact of demonetisation on the export sector will gradually reduce, as the cash flow situation will improve and it will be possible for workers in remote areas to get more and more connected to the banking system
 radimaid garments ke exporter vishwanath ji kaa noida main radimaid kapadon kaa kaarobaar he, joki dashakon se is vyapaar se jude rahe hai
 Viswanath says demonetisation is having a big impact on his business
 unhone enditivi se kaha, 'jo silaai-kadhai ke mazdoor hai, wo cash main pement maangate hai
 They only work in a factory for 5-10 days
 unke jaise dihadi workaron ko hamen cash main pement dena padataa he
 Also, for expensive readymade garments ready for export, small accessories like buttons, threads and chains also have to be purchased in cash '
 vishnath kehete hai ki sarkaar ne har hafte jo 50,000 rupaya cash nikaalane kii seemaa tay kii he, use badhanaa zaruri he
 Says Vishwanath, "I want the government to raise the cash withdrawal limit from Rs 50,000 to Rs one lakh
 ye behad zaruri he
 This will reduce the crisis in our business
 cash flo main sudhaar hoga'
 The comments darasal, ye sankat sirf radimaid garment sector tak simit nahin he
 Ajay Sahai, DG of the Federation of Indian Exporters Organization, says that in areas where a lot of manufacturing work is done in far-flung areas outside the factory, demonetisation is taking effect

 PM Modi said that when i was asked if you would come, i said if i was a guest? My destiny is, ever since i started understanding, there has been a close relationship with the head master and this institution
 -ye hamaari maansikta he ki chamatkaar ke bina hamen acha nahin lagata

 -piem modi ne ek vaakye kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki ek baar maine apane iees adhikari kaa prashikshan varg rakhaa tha
 Then i had called Brahmavihari Swami and told him to explain to him how the work gets completed within the time limit

 The Narmada Sardar Sarovar Dam is an excellent example of this

 During that hour and a half, several calls were received
 wo ek bete kii tarah meri chintaa karte the
 The head master once asked for a tape of my speech
 tab unhone kaha tha ki ye shabd mujhe nahin bolne chahie
 Once upon a time, a girl had gone out with her father
 barish or bheedbhad ke bich pita ne kaha tha ki betaa meraa haath pakadana
 At this, the daughter told him to hold my hand
 jab baap ne poocha ki kyon beti, tab beti ne kaha tha ki bheed ki vajah se meraa haath chhot saktaa he, lekin aap pakadenge to haath nahin chhutegaa
 Similarly, when Mhat Swami holds my hand, what worries me

 You may enter this temple without devotion, but you will become a devotee while leaving here
 -swaminarayan mandir bhavyata or divyata kaa pratik he

 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's Sir Sanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat has termed foreign capital investment (FDI in retail) as fatal for the country and said that the Sangh strongly opposes it
 bhagwat ne ravivaar ko jaipur ke jamdoli main chal rahe chaitanya shivi main bhaag le rahe swayan sevakon ke prashnon ke jawaab dete hue kaha ki is kshetra main videshi puunji nivesh se desh kaa aam vyapaaree sankat main aa jayega

 unhone desh ke samaksh jwalanth chunautiyon kii charchaa karte hue kaha ki china kii niti hameshaa se samrajyavaadee rahi he isliye hamen apni suraksha kii drushti se samrik taiyaari majboot rakhni chahie
 He said that the people of China consider India culturally and emotionally a guru, keeping in mind that there should be an effort to create a good environment for the people of China towards India
 tippaniyan The Sangh chief said in the context of atrocities on Hindus abroad, that the Central Government should pressurize all countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh, in which the Hindus are being harassed
 unhone abhi haal hi main pakistan se jodhpur aae hinduon ko sharnaarthi kaa darja dekar unhen bharat kii naagarikta die jane kii vakaalat kii
 He said that it is difficult to solve the problems of Hindus until the society is united and full of power

 He recently advocated granting of citizenship of India to Hindus who had come to Jodhpur from Pakistan as refugee status
 unhone kaha ki jab tak samaaj ekajute hokar shakti sampann nahin ho jaataa tab tak hinduon kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan ho paanaa kathin he
 He said that it is difficult to solve the problems of Hindus until the society is united and full of power
 pichley do dashak main bharat kii vikaas dar 6 se 7 fisadi ke bich rahi he
 Can consider it good in terms of development
 magar kya iskaa laabh hamaare mazdooron ko bhi mila? bilkul nahin, kyonki agar mila hota to nunatam mazdooree or vetan main itnaa bada antar nahin dikhataa
 The 'india Ways Report' of the International Labor Organization states that the increase in the wages of the organized sector from 1993 to 2012 did not remain in the unorganized sector
 lihaaja, majdoor varg kii bechaargi aaj bhi waisi hi he, jaisi 90 ke dashak main hua karti thi
 In many states it is linked to per capita income but there is such a difference between states that something cannot be said accurately
 jaise haryana main dihadi 783 rupye or gujarat main 320 rupye he
 Whereas Gujarat is nowhere less prosperous than Haryana
 sawaal he ki tab desh main 'liberlijeshan' or 'free market iconmi' kaa phayda kise mila jab samaaj kaa ek bada tabaka hi vanchit rahaa? jaahir he ki bharat kaa ek mutthi bhar varg jo sangathit kshetra kaa carmik he, use vetan suvidhaon kaa bharpoor laabh mila or yah laabh din dooni raat chauguni kii gati se badhata gaya
 But sadly, our workers still stand at the same crossroads where the country once used to be in the 90s
 haalanki kai rajya aise bhi hai jahaan mazdooron ko ek sammanjanak raashi di jaati he
 Delhi tops it where unskilled laborers are given Rs 538 and skilled people up to Rs 652
 kin rajyon main kitni mazdooree11 farvari 2019 ko loksabhaa main di gai jaankaree ke mutabik andhra pradesh main akushal mazdooron ko 69 rupye jabaki atikushal mazdooron ko 895 rupye die jate hai
 In Assam, 244 rupees is given to the unskilled and Rs 485 to the unskilled laborers
 bihar main 181 rupye akushal or 282 rupye atikushal mazdooron ko miltaa he
 Chhattisgarh has a daily wage of Rs 234 unskilled and Rs 338 unskilled laborers
 gujarat main akushal shramikon ko 100 rupye or kushal ko 293 rupye milte hai
 In Haryana, this amount is 326 rupees and 417 rupees
 jharkhand main akushal ko 229 rupye or atikushal ko 366 rupye milte hai
 If you look at the figures of other states, in Karnataka, unskilled laborers get Rs 262 and unskilled laborers get maximum Rs 607
 kerala main akushalon ko 287 rupye se lekar 510 rupye tak milte hai
 Unskilled laborers get from 284 to 556 rupees
 madhya pradesh main yah raashi 283 rupye se lekar 419 rupye tak he
 Unskilled laborers in Maharashtra get from Rs 180 to Rs 315
 odisha main akushalon ko 200 rupye or atikushal mazdooron ko 260 rupye milte hai
 There is a provision of Rs 311 in Punjab and Rs 415 for the untouchables
 rajasthan main yah raashi kramshah 207 or 277 rupye he
 In Uttar Pradesh, this amount is Rs 228 and Rs 324
 bengal main akushal shramikon ko 211 rupye or atikushal ko 370 rupye milte hai
 In Delhi, the maximum skilled people get Rs 538 and skilled workers get Rs 652
 loksabhaa main jari uparorakt aankade bataate hai ki adhikansh rajya aise hai jahaan mazdooree ab bhi kaaphi kam he jo kisi majdoor kaa parivaar chalaane ke liye naakaafi he
 For example, in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, there is a provision of giving only 69 rupees to unskilled laborers
 gujarat main 100 rupye to puducheri main 55 rupye he
 Apart from this, there is also a question that what is the number of people employed who get a fixed salary and how many people who have wages in their daily wages? a figure for 2011-12 shows that 62 percent of the total employed people are employed as 'casual workers'
 isse saaf he ki bharat main rojgaar praapt logon kii sankhya bhale badi ho, par cajual, informal yaa saamaajik suraksha se pare mehnat-majuri main hi zyaadaatar log aaj bhi khapate hai
 Different reports also reveal that as seen in the salaried class and the daily wage, it is also seen in different states of the country, women and men and the educated illiterate
 iskaa arth he ki desh ke kisi rajya main mazdooree kaaphi acchhee to kisi rajya main kaaphi gairat bhari he
 The wages of men are more educated than the illiterate than the wages of women
 kya shahar or kya gaanv, mahilaayein aaj bhi isse abhishpt hai ki purushon kii tulana main unhen kam tankhwaah milti he
 The huge differential growth rate in wages in states is also related to per capita income
 yun kahen ki vikaas dar badhane se logon kii aay main ijapha hota he jisase unke rahan-sahan aadhunik or suvidhasampann hote jate hai
 But there is a problem in how much a worker gets, a third party decides it
 ye teesraa paksh centre yaa rajya sarkarein hai
 The provision of minimum wages in the laws related to wages is statutory but not binding
 lihaaja har rajya apane apane str par mazdooree tay karte hai
 From this, should we assume that the state which is more prosperous will give the same wage to the laborers? It is important to know here that after 1993-94 the difference between maximum and minimum wages has been seen in the states
 udhaaharan ke taur par haryana, assam, jharkhand, jammu evam kashmir, punjab, tamilnadu or gujarat ko le sakate hai
 There are deep inequalities in per capita income in these states
 haryana main jahaan prati vyakti aay 1,48,485 rupye he to assam main 54,618 rupye
 Its effect is also seen on the average daily wage
 haryana main dihadi 783 rupye to assam main 607 rupye he
 The per capita income in Jharkhand is 56,733 and daily wage is Rs 543
 jammu evam kashmir main prati vyakti aay 62,857 or dihadi 495 rupye, punjab main prati vyakti aay 1,14,561 or dihadi 362 rupye he
 The per capita income in Tamil Nadu is Rs 1,30,197 and wages are Rs 388
 gujarat main prati vyakti aay 1,24,678 or mazdooree 320 rupye he
 Beyond the per capita income, the daily wages of laborers make it clear that even if the states are prosperous, the per capita income may be thick but it does not convert into wages of the hard working people
 agar aisa hota to gujarat main mazdooree haryana se itani kam na hoti kyonki donon rajyon kii prati vyakti aay main maamuli antar he
 If per capita income were to be measured, Assam, Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir should have been at the bottom of this list because they are poor states
 lekin aisa nahin he
 It is clear that it depends on the state governments how much they care for the welfare of the workers and how much they benefit them
 is antar kaa kaaran kyadihadi or mazdooree main bharat ke naam ek acha record he
 Among developing countries, India is the only nation to have implemented the Minimum Wages Act (1948)
 is kanoon kaa makasad garibi or asamanta kam karnaa he lekin tajjub kii baat he ki yahaan jitne pradesh hai, unase kai guna zyada nunatam vetan kii daren hai
 According to one figure, there are about 1709 different pay rates in India
 jaankaar bataate hai ki bharat main vetan sambandhi agar gambhir shoshan he to iske peeche alag alag daren kaaran hai
 Different for the mill worker, different for the agricultural laborer, something for the brick kiln worker, something for the mason
 bihar main alag mazdooree to arunachal main kuch or
 These disparities suggest that the more differences in wage slabs, the greater the severity of exploitation
 bharat philhal isi se trast he
 Living expenses and minimum wages In India, the day when a person will be associated with the living standard, the golden day of the unorganized sector will be in front of us
 nunatam mazdooree yaa vetan tay karte vakt iskaa kam hi dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki falaan ke ghar main kitne sadsy hai, unka moolbhoot kharch kya he, bhojan pani, dawa, pahanava odhava aadi nunatam mazdooree se vahan ho paaenge yaa nahin
 The side effect of this is that a worker, despite being in employment, is unable to bear his daily expenses and gets stuck in the debt trap
 aise logon ke liye garibi hataao abhiyaan mahaj kori kalpana se zyada kuch bhi nahin he
 Where is the error and the scope for improvement? In India, in a wage-like country, only about 65 percent people are enshrined in the minimum wage law
 baaki ke 35 fisadi log isse baahar hai
 The condition of such people is worse because they are not getting legal protection apart from being deprived of wages
 vetan kanoon vaidhanik bhale ho lekin badhyakaari nahin he
 Until this is made binding, the states will not be stressed and they may not even feel the need to give an honorable amount to the laborers on the basis of 'cost of living'

 (input from the answer given in indiaspend, Lok Sabha) pakistan ke pradhanmantri usoof raja gilaani ke jansampark adhikari ne shanivaar ko sweekaar kiya ki america main giraftaar sandigdh aatanki david hedli uskaa sautela bhai he lekin usne in khabaron ko khaarij kiya ki uske parivaar kaa pradhanmantri se koi rishta he
 Public Relations Officer Daniyal Gilani said in a statement that the Indian media is trying to prove the relationship between Yusuf Raza Gilani and the family of suspected American terrorist and my half-brother Dawood Gilani alias David Coleman Headley is completely false and baseless
 danial gilaani ne kaha ki report atakalon par aadhaarit he or iskaa uddeshy anaavashyak sansani utpann karnaa he
 He said that his ancestors had settled in Pakistan from Jastarwal in Punjab province of India and Etawah in Uttar Pradesh while Yusuf Raza Gilani's family has been living in Multan for centuries and the two families have no connection with each other
 danial ne sweekaar kiya ki beete disambar main pradhanmantri gilaani ne uske pita saiyad saleem gilaani kii mrityu par shok sandesh bheja tha or samvednaa vyakt karne ke liye unke ghar gayi the
 Daniel Gilani said, "I have done this as a courtesy because i work as their public relations officer and also because my father was a well-known broadcaster and well-known figure of his time
" us samay daud gilaani pakistan main nahin tha
 Gilani said that he has been in the post of Public Relations Officer since the tenure of then Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz in 2005 and he did not leave the post even after the Pakistan People's Party-led government came to power
 apane sautele bhai ke bare main jaankaree dete hue gilaani ne kaha, ‘‘doosraa naam rakhane yaa ek samay nayaa naam rakhane kaa uskaa faisla bhi mujhe chaunkaa gaya tha
 He said that Headley started living in Islamabad since 2002 after passing the Civil Services Examination and since then i have had little contact with him
 gilaani ne kaha, ‘‘daud se meri antim mulaakaat mere pita ke nidhan ke baad kareeb ek varsh pehle hui jab vah pakistan aayaa tha
 He said that Dawood was born in 1960 in Washington, where his father worked in the Voice of America and married an American woman
 gilaani ne kaha, ‘‘daud ke janm ke turant baad mere pita kii posting samaapt ho gayi or dampati pakistan chalaa aayaa
 In the 1960s, my father and Dawood's mother divorced and according to the elders of the family, she moved to the US again
 ’’ The festival of Dev Diwali is celebrated on the day of Kartik Purnima, 15 days after Deepawali
 har tyohaar kii tarah yah tyohaar bhi kai rajyon main manaaya jaataa he
 But most of its enthusiasm is seen in Benaras
 is din maa ganga kii puja kii jaati he
 The sight of the banks of the Ganges is very amazing on this day, because on this festival of Dev Diwali, the ghats of the river Ganges are lit by lighting them
 kyon manaate hai dev divalimanyataon ke anusaar is din shankar bhagwaan ne rakshas tripurasur kaa vadh kiya tha
 In this joy, the devas celebrated this day by lighting a lamp in heaven

 Keep these things in mind - On the day of Diwali, bathing the Ganges has great importance
 - is din gharon main tulsi ke paudhe ke aage deepak jalaana bhi bahut shubh mana jaataa he
 - Donating diyas on the day of Diwali is considered very auspicious
 - mana jaataa he ki jo log is din purab kii taraf munh karke diye daan karte hai, unpar ishwar kii krupa hoti he
 It is also said that on this day, God blesses those who donate lamps with a long life
 saath hi ghar main sukh shanti kaa maahaul bana rahata he
