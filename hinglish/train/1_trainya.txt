 These days, a letter has become a trap for the Chief Minister of Jharkhand, Shibu Soren
 aaj tamaad vidhansabha kshetra main upachunaav he or ek chitthee main naksaliyon kii ore se farmaan sunaaya gaya he ki wo shibu sorain ko hi vot den
 Now the opposition is making it an issue and Guruji is tickling
 guruji gusse main hai
 The fires are raging with anger
 vajah he somvaar ko tamaad main hone vaala upachunaav
 The neck is stuck in the by-election of Chief Minister Shibu Soren
 muqabla trikoniya ho chalaa he or isi bich vidhansabha kshetra main ghoomane lagi he naksaliyon kii ye chitthee
 In this letter, the Naxalites have instructed Guruji to vote and if the decree is not accepted, then the head of the village is punished for death
 guruji is chitthee ko lekar uth rahe sawaalon se bhannaae hue hai or unhen lag rahaa he ki kahin naksaliyon ke chakkar main gardan naa nap jaae
 However, Shibu Soren is calling it an opposition move
 ranchi ke tamaad kaa ye ilaaka naksaliyon kaa garh he
 It was in this area that Naxalites killed the JDU MLA in broad daylight
 aise main vipaksh aarope laga rahaa he ki shibu sorain naksaliyon kaa khauf dikhaakar chunaav jeetne kii jugat main hai
 Guruji was earlier stained by three Naxalites to get them out of the police station
 tab vipaksh ne vidhansabha main mukhyamantri awaas se phone kiye jane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 But the case of letter is more complicated
 naksaliyon kii bataai ja rahi chitthee chunaav se thik pehle ai he
 The indian-american yoga guru made a victim of the pretext of teaching yoga to his 46-year-old little girl
 'hot yoga' ijad karne vaale guru bikram choudhary par isse pehle bhi paanch chatraayen rape kaa iljaam laga chuki hai
 Hundreds of celebrities around the world are fond of this yoga guru
 padhie yoga guru kaa rape cond
 
 
 Bikram Choudhary, when he left India for the first time 40 years ago, made his move to America, he did not even think that one day he would rule the US as well as the whole world due to his yogasanas, but his There is no other example of what he has achieved through effort and luck
 
 
 
 And Yoga was transformed into hot yoga
 Yoga was a new thing for yoga practitioners, Bikram found out the unique recipe of keeping people fit and learning at 100 Fahrenheit, a temperature of about 40 degrees Celsius Along with yoga, Chaudhary has also been elevated to fame
 aam americanyon ke saath-saath duniya bhar ke log or khaas kar celibrities dekhte hi dekhte choudhary ke diwane ho gaye
 Years old hatha yoga in India was now transformed into 'hot yoga'
 choudhary ne maukey kaa phayda uthaaya or hot yoga ke 26 asana kii patent hasil kar lee
 Gradually, Chaudhary achieved everything that a common man could aspire to
 phir chaahe wo aaleeshaan bangala ho, mahangi gaadi yaa phir karodon kii daulat
 Chaudhary had everything but the first crack at this Sheesh Mahal when a student of his accused accused of raping her and spread sensation all over the world
 iske baad to jaise choudhary paryon utpeedan ke iljaamon kii jhadisi lag gai
 Four more girls, who have been supervised by this student, accused Chaudhary of having very similar charges, many of which are currently being heard by the US court
 takreeban do saal baad ab choudhary par phir thik ek vaisaa hi iljaam laga he, jaisaa isse pehle laga tha
 This time too, this girl who is accused of rape is nobody else, but she is a student 46 years younger than him
 pehali baar saal 2010 main kiya balaatkaaramashhoor america akhbaar neuyork times kii maane to canadian mul kii is ladki ne bikram choudhary ke khilaaf ye ilzaam lagaakar naa sirf sabko chaunkaa diya he, balki america adaalat main uske khilaaf baqayada ek mukadmaa bhi darj karavaaya he
 In her complaint, Jill Lawler, who accused Chaudhary, has said that Chaudhary raped her for the first time in 2010 when she joined Chaudhary's teacher training classes in Las Vegas at the age of 18
 was
 un dinon training course ke dauraan hi uske guru bikram choudhary ne ek baar use ek hindi film dikhaai or is dauraan wo usseghanton tak apni maalish karwaata rahaor phir mauka dekh kar usne ladki ko daboch liya or uske saath jyaadati kii
 Then Chaudhary must have been 64 years old
 pehle rape kiya phir maangi maafeelollar ne bataaya he ki is baad choudhary ne isse maafee bhi maangi or use ek champion banane kaa vaayada kiya lekin iske mahaj ek hafte baad choudhary ne use phir echotel main akele milane ke liye bulayaor uske vahaan pahunchate hi usne phir se use apane napak iraadon kaa shikaar banaaya
 After this, he continued training with Chaudhary for a few years and Chaudhary continued to force him with him time and time again
 aakhri baar is yoga guru ne lollar ke saath farvari 2013 main balaatkaar kiya
 However, Lawler, who had practiced yoga with Chaudhary till July 2014, said that she had been deeply troubled by the sexual harassment till now and had remained silent for that reason
 haalanki choudhary ke khilaaf ye koi pehla or nayaa maamla nahin he
 Even before this, six different age girls have made similar allegations against him, but the amazing thing is that despite this, Chaudhary has increased more with time than it has in fame
 lollar kii tarah sara boggan naam kii ek ladki ne bhi choudhary ke khilaaf balaatkaar kaa iljaam lagaate hue adaalat main shikaayat daayar kii he
 Some muttering and taxing in Cannes, Repsara has said that in the year 2000, Chaudhary made her a victim when she was learning yoga with him
 sara bhi lollar kii tarah hi choudhary se umr main kaaphi choti he
 There is a gap of 38 years between the two, but in spite of this, in the year 2000, once daily, Chaudhary first murmured in his ear a few lewd things and then raped her
 26 hot yogasana se duniya bhar ko apana mureed banane vaale bikram choudhary ne agar yoga kii badaulat har duniyavi cheez hasil kii he, to wo vivaadon main bhi kam nahin rahe hai
 This is the reason that this is not the first and only case of rape on Chaudhary, but the sixth case
 ye or baat he ki pehle kii tarah hi is baar bikram choudhary ne khud par lage is ilzaam kaa khandan kiya he
 Started at the age of four, Yogachara, Bikram Chaudhary, who started yoga at the age of one, was born in Kolkata
 dekhte hi dekhte unhen yoga kii lagan kuch aisi lagi ki wo har roj kam se kam 6 ghante tak yogabhyas karne lage or is kadi mehnat kaa nateeja ye hua ki bikram tamaam yogasano main behad maahir ho gaye
 At the age of just 13, he won the attention of the entire world by naming the title of National India Yoga Championship
 bikram ke sitare kuch itani bulandiyon par pahunche ki 1973 main felbitis naam kii beemaari se jujh rahe america raashtrapati nicksan ne unhen apane ilaaj ke liye bulaava bheja
 After this Bikram remained in America and started teaching yoga there
 iske baad bikram choudhary ne apane naam se bikram hot yoga kii shuruyaat kar yoga kaa hi ek brands bana diya or alag-alag mulkon main isi naam se yoga studios kii shuruyaat kar di
 Then on seeing it, he started playing in millions and millions and billions
 duniya ke sabase amir yoga guru or vivaadon kii jhadiduniya ke sabase amir lekin sabase vivaadit yoga guru bikram choudhary ke saath bhi ek ajeeb ittefaq he
 Incidentally, whenever Chaudhary came into the controversy due to sex and in most cases, the girls accused of him turned out to be less than half their age
 kai saal pehle choudhary ne ek intervyuu main khud kassim yon shakti kaa maalikbataya tha
 Now Jill Lawler, a Canadian-origin girl, has now brought Choudhary into a new headlines by complaining, but Bikram Choudhary first came into controversy when two more girls, five years ago, in 2013, started doing yoga classes
 During the same period, there were allegations of rape
 tab choudhary ke khilaaf rape or jyaadati ke 11 maamle darj karwaae gaye the
 After initial hearing by the court, 8 out of 11 cases were approved for further hearing
 inamen se ek mahila sara bodan thi, jabaki duusari minakshi japha boden, jisane choudhary par yon utpeedan or manahani kaa iljaam lagaaya tha
 Just like these three girls, another student of Chaudhary, Larissa Anderson, also accused him of rape
 anderson kaa kahana tha ki choudhary ne ek rose uske saath tab rape kiya, jab wo uske ghar par dinar ke liye gai thi
 After dinner, Chaudhary made Anderson a victim of lust when his wife fell asleep
 phir bhi puri duniya he divaniyon utpeedan ke iljaam se ghir kar choudhary beshak mukademon kaa saamana kar rahe hon, lekin choudhary ke mureedon main celibrities kii koi kami nahin
 It is not difficult to guess the status of the person who gives the first feast of coming to America but no one but the American President himself
 britain kaa footbal star david baikaham ho, mashhoor tennis player endi mare, pop singer madonna, ladi gaaga, dancer maaikel jackson yaa phir hollywood ectres jenifer aniston, choudhary ke phans or chaatro main namaaloom kitne hi aise log shaamil hai, jinase bas ek baar milane bhar ke liye puri duniya maari jaati he

 The father of his superb off-spin bowling and 'doosra' in world cricket is saddened by the behavior of Pakistan's former off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq with India's senior off-spinner Harbhajan Singh and keeping him out of the team
 unhone kaha ki bhajji ko istemaal kar phenk diya ja rahaa he
 Describing Raharavichandran Ashwin as a 'world-class bowler', Bhajji is not given a chance to play, Saqlain Mushtaq believes that not giving Harbhajan a chance to play in one of the T20 Internationals last year is not good for this bowler's confidence
 pakistani cricketer sakalan ne kaha, ‘harbhajan ke saath bhartiya cricket board or team prabandhan kaa bartaav bahut acha nahin he
 He was a world-class bowler and is still a world-class bowler
 aswin ke ubharne kaa matlab yah nahin he ki aap harbhajan ko baahar kar do yaa use bahut adhik dabaav main rakh do
 '39-year-old Saqlain, who took 208 wickets in Test cricket three times and 288 wickets in odis, said that it was not a good example for the team to exclude the best performing player
 unhone kaha, ‘aap dekho ki use jab (2001 main) baahar kiya gaya tab se usne teen baar vaapasi kii jiskaa matlab he ki jab aapako uski jarurat padi to aapane use team main liya or jab aapaki jarurat khatm ho gai aapane use baahar kar diya
 So you put pressure on him
 aapane pehle hi uski pichhali uplabdhiyon ko nazarandaaj kar diya he
 "bhajji was made the fourth choice bowler
 Sacklan said," He should have been the first-choice spinner and Ashwin's partner
 iske bajaay aapane us par aatm andeh paidaa kar die or ab use teesri yaa chauthi pasand kaa spinner bana diya he
 He said that when a player makes a comeback, his confidence is low and he needs to be confident to do his best
 unhone kaha, ‘meri spasht raay he yadi bhajji ke paas 100 fisadi kshamta he tab bhi vah pradarshan nahin kar paaegaa kyonki aap logon ne use ahsaas dilaa diya ki vah chauthe number kaa spinner he
 After all, the player is also a human being and he has feelings too
 acha pradarshan bhaawanaaon se judaa hota he
 If you are in a good state mentally, then your graph will increase and vice versa
 ’moin, leone se kahin aage hai asvinapurv pakistan of spinner sakalan ne aswin kii bhi jamkar tarif kii or kaha ki vah australia ke nathan leone or england ke moin ali se kaaphi aage hai
 He said, 'nathan Lyon and Moin Ali are yet to prove themselves but Ashwin is a world-class bowler and is bowling well right now
 uskaa najariya bahut acha he or main use shubhakamanaayen detaa hum
 Ashwin has proved himself in the Test match while two others still need to do something else

 Tennis season is long and career

 Review: Not Khilji, the story of the might of Rajputs is Bhansali's 'padmavat' Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'padmavat' If it is successful at the box office, then its biggest credit will go to Ranveer Singh and his character
 ek khoonkhaar villen jo har pal daraata he
 The clothes and jewelry from women to kings and queens keep the film alive

 Posted bykanwar sandhuonsaturday, December 19, 2015 Everything is not right now between BJP and Shiv Sena
 kaale dhan ke mudde par centre sarkaar kosupreme court kii fatkaar ke baadashivsena ne bhi chutki lee he
 The Shiv Sena has criticized the Modi government for mentioning only three names
 party pramukh uddhav thakare ne centre ke kadam ko 'chane kurmura' jaisaa bataaya he
 Uddhav Thackeray's party has suggested that the Center should start bringing back black money from indigenous black money
 party ke mukhpatr 'saamana' kii sampadakeey main uddhav ne likhaa he ki centre ko ab ehsaas ho rahaa he ki kaale dhan ke mudde ko sanbhaalanaa kitna mushkil he
 However, he has also written that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has the ability to resolve the issue
 centre sarkaar ko aade haathon lete hue unhone likhaa, 'tab (chunaav se pehle) kalaadhan virdohi prachaarkon kaa daawa tha ki agar videshi bainkon main jamaa sara kalaadhan swadesh main aa gaya to hindustaniyon ke har ghar par sone ke chappar chadh jaaenge
 So far, the government has named only three people
 yah dekhte hue puraa maamla chane-kurmure jaisaa lagata he
 The Shiv Sena chief has written, "the business of Gujarat businessman Pankaj Lodhia has an annual turnover of about Rs 80 crore
 suna he ki unke videshi bank ke khate main sirf 50 karod kii raashi jamaa he
 This in itself is a big joke
 'shivasena pramukh ne poocha he ki kaale dhan ke peeche kaa satya kya he
 He has also said that elections themselves are the Gangotri of black money
 shivasena pramukh ne kaale dhan ko dimak kii tarah bataaya he
 He has written that after states like Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, now Maharashtra has also fallen into its grip
 chicago kii is maa ko ye bataane main koi shame nahin he ki wo apane bacchon kaa dhyaan rakhane se pehle bhaang kaa nasha karti he
 This mother believes that the intoxication of cannabis makes her a better mother
 liya grover kii umr 31 saal kii he
 She says that she feels she can handle her children in a better way by taking intoxicating cannabis
 par unhen is baat se sakht etraj he ki log unhen unki is aadat kii vajah se aksar galat jaj kar lete hai
 Although this is not true logically, but Leia says that she can handle her children much better after getting intoxicated by cannabis
 unke saath zyada masti kar paati hai
 Manage their stubbornness much better
 unhone apane ingnokhe pareinting skill ko lekar ek lekh bhi likhaa he
 The good thing is that Leia does not take drugs every day
 saath hi gaadi chalaane se pehle bhi wo aisa karne se bachati hai
 She takes full care of her children, so she does not take drugs in front of them
 wo nasha us vakt hi karti hai jab wo apane bacchon ko sanbhaalane ke dauraan tanaav mahasoos karne lagati hai
 She breaks away from them after taking a short break and returns back after getting drugged
 pehali baar 15 saal kii umr main unhone bhaang kaa nasha kiya tha
 He slowly got addicted to it and he started liking it
 wo bataati hai ki bich main kai saalon tak unhone iskaa seven nahin kiya lekin ek din jab wo ghar main akeli thim or unke bachche ro rahe the-cheekh rahe the to wo kaaphi tanaav main aa gai thim
 He then searched for his box which he had not touched for a long time
 usamen se ek paf lene ke baad unka sara tanaav kam ho gaya
 He says that when she returned to her children after getting drunk, she was very relaxed and she was not stressed
 unka maananaa he ki bhaang kaa nasha kar lene ke baad unhen unke bacchon ke shor, cheekh or gandani machaane se fark padana band ho jaataa he
 After doing this, she does not take stress and is able to take better care of her children
 dakshin africa kii lee en pes rio olympic se baahar hone vaali pehali mahila golf ban gai hai

 Two days ago, world number-1 male golfer Jason Day and Shane Lawrie also announced not to attend the Serio Olympics for fear of the Zika virus

 He also commented on the criticism that followed the withdrawal
 unhone yahaan tak kah daalaa ki olympic main golf khelnaa or vahaan gold jeetna is khel kii sabase badi uplabdhi nahin he
 After Uma Bharti in Sadhvi Pragya case, now Veerappa Moily has given advice to BJP
 moili kaa kahana he ki pragna maamle main bijepi kaa bartaav bataata he ki court or jaanch agecinyo par se uskaa bharosa uth chukaa he
 Moily said that Congress is the only party that has not seen religion associated with terrorism till date
 unhone bijepi ke netao ko naseehat dete hue kaha ki pragna maamle main jaanch puri hone deni chahie, uske baad doodh kaa doodh pani kaa pani ho jayega

 aman or insaaniyat kii dushman takatein alag-thalag pad chuki he
 Such desperate and frustrated forces are plotting to spoil the atmosphere of peace and peace, but people's solidarity and commitment to peace and peace will defeat such forces
 nakvi ne kaha ki saamaajik sauhaard, sahishnutaa bharat ke diene main he
 We have to work together to keep India's culture of unity stronger
 kendriya mantri ne kaha ki duniya main kisi bhi desh ke mukaable bharat main alpsankhyakon ke saamaajik, dharmik, sanvaidhanik adhikaar sabase zyada surakshit he
 In Maharashtra, bjp's ally Shiv Sena has targeted the Modi government over Kanhaiya Kumar, the president of JNU Students' Union
 shivasena ne apane mukhpatr saamana main likhaa ki jamaanat par chuta kanhaiya jahrile naag kii tarah roj dansh maar rahaa he or fan hilaakar bhaajapa or uske logon ko daraa rahaa he
 In an editorial comparing Hardik to Kanhaiya, the party wrote, 'A case of treason has also been filed against Hardik Patel, who runs the Patel reservation movement in Gujarat
 lekin kai maah biit gaye, phir bhi hardik ko jamaanat nahin mili
 Even people like Colonel Purohit, Sadhvi Pragya did not get bail, but despite the JNU case being so famous, the accused of treason gets released on bail in 10-15 days and comes out and ridicules the government, what is the matter? Read, on Kanhaiya Big disclosure 'who is responsible for Kanhaiya's free publicity?' Shiv Sena said, 'kanhaiya has posed the challenge of free passage
 anaaj, pani, davaaiyaan mahangi hui to prasiddhi muft, sirf vah dusron ko na mili yahi vivaad kaa vishay dikhataa he
 'the party said that Kanhaiya is getting free benefits, who is responsible for this, as Naidu (venkaiah) says?' The government also taxed the sweat of the workers' Shiv Sena also imposed tax on EPF Modi government Circle saamana main likhaa, 'majdoor varg, shramik varg ke mehnat ke 'provident fund' ke paise par bhi sarkaar ne ab kar laga diya he
 The government has reiterated the same thing by taxing the sweat of hard workers
 israel ke pradhanmantri benjamin netanyahu ne duniya ko chetaya ki ve iran ke nae raashtrapati hasan ruhani ke kathith taur par udaaravaadi najar aa rahe sanketon or samjhaute vaali tippaniyon ke jhaanse main na aae
 According to a statement released from Netanyahu's office, he said, the world should not fall prey to the Iranian president's unconvincing declarations
 unhone kaha, yah vahi ruhani hai jo iran ke vivaadaaspad parmaanu kaarykram ko lekar ateet main hui vaartaon main antarrashtriya samudaay ko dhokhaa de chuke hai
 Netanyahu was referring to the time when Rouhani was Iran's chief nuclear negotiator
 tippaniyan Israel, along with the US and other major global powers, suspect that Iran is building a nuclear bomb under the guise of its nuclear power program
 tehran in aaropon ko galat bataata he
 Netanyahu said, Iran is advancing its nuclear program

 You can consider Jim Chanos, America's hedge fund owner, as opposed to Jim Rogers
 philhal singapore main rah rahe global niveshak or lekhak gym rogers 30 karod dollar kii sampatti ke maalik hai
 Rogers has recently distanced itself from the Indian stock markets, hearing the absence of economic reforms led by the new government in India
 duusari taraf 1
 Chanos, a $ 5 billion owner, is a noted shot-seller who has been betting on the possibility of increasing odds in China
 bharat ko lekar rogers kii paini tippaniyon ne bhale hi surkhiyaan batori hon lekin unke ulahne bharat ke liye utane keemtee nahin hai, jitna keemtee he china ke bare main chanos ko lekar chuninda visheshgyon kaa akalan
 The mistakes that Chanos had been warning of in China since 2009, the same mistakes have started happening in India's economic management
 pehali naseehatah aarthik aankadon main siyasat to musiibat pakkisarkarein hameshaa apni aguai main mulk kii chhavi chamkaati hai lekin aarthik aankadon main siyaasi chhaunk khatarnaak hoti he
 After coming to power the Modi government changed the GDP figures and suddenly the Indian economy grew from 5-6 percent to 7-7
 5 fisadi najar aane lagi
 Experts around the world doubted this because the ground reality is completely different from this
 alabatta in aankadon par safai dene kii bajaae sarkaar ne yah daawa shuru kar diya ki bharat apni growth main china ko pachhad rahaa he
 It is important to understand that India's overall GDP is only 20 percent of China's GDP
 china agar har saal paanch fisadi kii gati se bhi aage badha to chaar saal se kam vakt main bharat jitani ek arthvyavastha jod legaa
 Just as India Shining's new efforts are not embracing the experts, similarly China's GDP figures are a puzzle for the world
 europe va america ke karj sankat kii tulana main china isliye zyada daraata he kyonki is desh ke aankadon main paardarshita nahin he, isliye jokhim kaa akalan mushkil he
 Recall China's Premier Li Keqwang's 2010 statement when he said that "economic data are man-made, therefore not reliable
" ”china ke jidipi aankadon par shaq 1998 ke purvi asia sankat ke baad shuru hua tha jab china kii sabhi padosi arthvyavasthaaen dhahin lekin usne kareeb 8 fisadi kii growth dikhaai
 In recent years too, industrial production figures have been tantamount to claims of China's rapid growth
 aaj jab china mushkil main he to saakh ke sabase zyada sawaal iske aarthik aankadon par uth rahe hai, jinamein hameshaa siyasat kaa tadakaa lagata rahaa he
 Second advice: if the bank is weak, the risk is heavy, if the preparations of the government do not go smoothly, then soon the loan fair will be back on the lines of 1980
 centre sarkaar mudra bank ke jariye karj baantne kaa abhiyaan shuru karne vaali he
 Preparation is that some small loans be given without collateral
 yah sujh daraavnee he, khaas taur par us vakt jab bainkon kii taraf se baante gaye karj ke har ek rupye main 12 paise kii vasuuli mushkil ho gai or fanse hue kul karjon kaa aakaar 3 lakh karod rupye se upar nikal gaya he
 The investment vehicle in the country is at a standstill as cheaper debt is the basic condition of growth and despite the lower interest rate from the Reserve Bank, banks are not ready to make loans that are stuck with stuck debts
 modi sarkaar se apeksha thi ki vah bainkon kaa punargathan karegi or fanse hue karjon kii samasya kaa samaadhaan karegi
 When the government should have shown the courage to recover the outstanding loans that most of the big loans are in the name of companies with political clout, then the introduction of "loan fairs" is the same mistake as China
 china ne apni banking phoonk kar hi growth kaa tamaasha dekha he
 In China about 15 years ago, the total outstanding debt was one trillion dollars, which is now at 25 trillion dollars
 china ke sarkari bainkon ne rajnatik dabaav par karj baante jo real estate yaa anutpaadak audyogic nivesh main istemaal hue
 China's building construction has transformed into legends, which are about 1
 3 arab dollar kaa karj liye baitha he or fatne vaala he
 As demand for real estate and industrial exports plummeted, Chinese banks began lending to investors in a variety of micro finance schemes and stock markets, and the cancer of debt spread from industry to stocks
 bharat kii banking yakeenan china jitani buree nahin he lekin modi sarkaar banane ke baad bharat main khatre kii pehali chetavaniyaan banking ko lekar hi ai hai
 The International Monetary Fund, in a report in April, described India's banks in the most dangerous situation after Russia

 It is being talked about Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST), whose building gives a glimpse of the cultural heritage of 3 countries
 unesco ne 15 saal pehle is aitihaasik imaarat ko vishwa viraasat sthal ghoshit kiya, jo aaj se thik 141 saal pehle bani thi
 Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus was once famous as Victoria Terminus (VT)
 1853 main mumbai (tab bombai) ke boribandar stesan se thane ke liye pehali yatri train (34 kilometre) daudi thi or iske baad yaheen par 20 june 1878 ko victoria terminus stesan kaa nirmaan kaary shuru kiya gaya jo agle 10 saalon main banakar taiyaar hua
 Victoria Terminus is named after the then British Queen Victoria
 yah us samay mumbai main sabase zyada samay main taiyaar honi vaali imaarat bhi thi
 16 million rupees spent 140 years ago
 The Victoria Terminus, which is counted among the world's most beautiful terminus, was designed by the British architect FW Stevens and this building 2
 85 hectare kshetra main faili hui he
 Construction of this building was completed from 1878 to 1888
 (royatres)is imaarat ke nirmaan main tab kii keemat ke aadhaar par 16,13,863 rupye (2,60,000 sterling pound) kharch hue or tab kii yah mumbai kii sabase mahangi imaarat ke rup main charchit bhi rahi

 In the first half of the 90s there was a movement to change many foreign names
 shivasena ne victoria terminus kaa naam badalane ko lekar jamkar pradarshan kiya
 Later in 1996, the then Railway Minister Suresh Kalmadi changed the name of Victoria Terminus to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus
 haalanki naam badale jane ke 23 saal baad aaj bhi log is siasti kii jagah victoria terminus yani vity hi bulaate hai
 The CST has the shape of a giant lion at either end of the gate of the Kalavictoria terminus of 3 countries with one end symbolizing Great Britain and the other end symbolizing India
 aitihaasik terminus main 3 deshon (bharat, britain or italy) kii sthapaty kala najar aati he
 The main structure of this building was made of sandstone and limestone while the interior used high quality Italian marble
 saath hi imaarat main paramparaagat bhartiya sthapaty kala kaa bhi istemaal kiya gaya
 There is also a high dome in the middle of the building of Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus which speaks of the greatness of this architecture
 terminus ke andar kaa najaara or bhi bhavy he or ghumaavdaar sidhiyon, deevaaron or chhaton kii jaandaar nakkashi har kisi kaa man moh leti he
 The statue of Queen Victoria was placed at the intermediate location of the building, but after independence this statue was removed from here

 The Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, which has become the hallmark of Mumbai, is among the busiest railway stations in the country and it receives 30 lakh passengers daily

 At the time of construction, it may have been the plan of the British rulers that this building would become the hallmark of British rule, but after independence it became the identity of India internationally and now makes everyone aware of their heritage through Indian Railways

 Pahlaj Nihalani, chairman of the censor board, came up and my country started off great
 yahpradhanmantri narendra modi ke prachaar ke liye nihalanike dwaara taiyaar kiya gaya video tha, jisamen unki or unki sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon kaa varnan kiya gaya tha
 The word 'bapu-modi' was also used extensively
 nihalaani jaanate the ki 'prem ratan dhan payo' ko lekar hip he or badi sankhya main log ise dekhne bhi aaenge, shaayad isliye unhone film ke saath is gane ko pesh kar diya
 Let's be good vaise bhisalman khan2014 main pradhanmantri narendra modi (us samay pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar the) ke saath 'jai ho' ke dauraan patangabaaji kar chuke hai, isliesalmaan kii film ke saath nihalanika yah video aana koi hairat kii baat nahin thi
 But what chance this song has for this song is not understood because the results of Bihar elections have just come down and the NDA has lost a lot
 aise main isamen koi tuk najar nahin aayaa
 In such an environment, when the party needs to be churned and the government needs to move the development agenda fast, then start campaigning again, what kind of propaganda is this

 But have you ever thought that love can also increase your weight
 ji haa, yah ham nahin balki ek study main is baat kii pushti kii gai he
 According to a study by Australia's Central Queensland University, people are more likely to gain weight when they are in a love relationship with someone or they are in love with someone
 shodhakartaaon ne is study main lagbhag 15,000 se zyada logon ko shaamil kiya he
 They announced the results after comparing the body mass index (BMI) of the men and women included in the study
 bataa den ki study main alag-alag jeevanstyli ke singles or kapal donon tarah ke logon ko shaamil kiya gaya he

 vajan badhane kii ye he vajah-- study ke dauraan shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki pyaar or vajan badhane kaa ek duusare se gaharaa sambandh he
 Actually, when people are in a relationship with someone, after some time, the feeling of impressing their partner is gone
 khud par dhyaan na dene kii vajah se anjaane main hi logon kaa vajan badhane lagata he
 One of the main reasons for gaining weight is that people who are in a love relationship prefer to spend most of their time at home with partner instead of exercising by going to the gym
 badali hui jeevanstyli bhi vajan badhane kaa ek ahm kaaran he
 Do one thing to take your partner's test - often when people are in love then they are very happy and if the relationship is new then this happiness becomes double
 bataa den, jab ham khush hote hai to hamaare sharir main happy hormone oxitosin or dopamine nikalate hai
 These happy hormones lead to a desire to eat chocolates, wines and high calorie foods, which work to gain weight
 kya uttarakhand main mahila cricket khilaadiyon ke saath yon shoshan ho rahaa he? kya unke saath balaatkaar jaisi ghatnaayen ho rahi hai? agar vaaki khel mantri kii baat satya he to devbhumi ke liye isse zyada durbhagyapurna kuch bhi nahin ho saktaa
 Uttarakhand Sports Minister Arvind Pandey has warned cricket associations to improve
 saath hi ye bhi kaha he ki unke paas sabhi sanghon ke khilaaf puure pukhta saboot hai
 The Sports Minister also said that there are some people associated with cricket associations who are ruining the lives of women cricket players in the name of sports
 aise logon ke khilaaf dhara 376 ke tahat mukadmaa darj kiya jayega
 If this has happened or is happening to women cricketers, then Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat should also take action immediately
 kyonki khel jagat ke liye ye ghatana kisi kaale adhyay se kam nahin
 In the same country where the Prime Minister gives the slogan of Beti Bachao and Beti Padhao, such an incident is going to be shameful
 agar saboot hai to phir kyun ab tak khamosh he sarkaar?jis kadar khulkar khel mantri ne mahila khilaadiyon ke yon shoshan yaa balaatkaar kii baat kahi he
 Also, if proof is also said, then what is the reason that only action is being asked
 ab tak karrwai kyon nahin kii gai
 If i go to the post of minister, i will not let go
 Gundagardikhekhal while talking to Aaj Tak also made it clear that no matter what extent i have to go, i will go
 main uttarakhand ke bhavishya se kisi ko bhi khilwaad karne nahin duungaa
 Also, will not let anyone's hooliganism run
 aravind pandeya ne ye bhi saafe kiya ki behad afsos kii baat he kii kuch gire hue nichi category ke logon kii vajah se aaj uttarakhand ke honhaar khilaadi uttarakhand se na khelkar kisi anya rajya kaa naam roshan kar rahe hai
 The country may be mine, but the name of the state should also be illuminated
 isliye ye saafe kar detaa hum ki agar mere uttarakhand ke cricket bhavishya ko main nahin nikhaar paaya to mujhe khel mantri rahane kaa bhi koi adhikaar nahin he
 i will resign from my post of sports minister without delay
 aakhir kyun hai aise halaat?gauratlab he kii pichley 17 varshon se uttarakhand main cricket jagat ko apane hi rajya main BCCI kii manyata se vanchit rahanaa padaa
 Because there is not one, but many cricket associations in Devbhoomi Uttarakhand which have formed their own association
 isaki vajah se aapas main takaraav lagaataar pichley varshon main dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Perhaps this is the reason why the Sports Minister had to take a tough stand

 Congo hemorrhagic fever spread in Pakistan poses a threat to spread in India as well
 bharat sarkaar or rajasthan sarkaar ne border se sate sabhi ilaakon main alert jari kar diya he
 After the outbreak of this disease in Pakistan, the Medical Department of Rajasthan has sent the Health Department team to the areas of Barmer, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Sriganganagar and Jodhpur

 Seeing the increasing number of its patients, the Central Government is also concerned and the Government has also sent a 2 member team of National Center Disease of Control to Rajasthan to take stock of the situation

 iske alaava barmer ke ek rogi kii jodhpur main mrityu hui he, usamen bhi congou rog ke keetanu hone kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Danger of spreading the virus Experts say that there is a danger of spreading the disease to people traveling from Pakistan to India

 For this 15-second video, it is being claimed that PM Modi used abuses in his address
 deepawali najadik he or iske saath hi puure desh main ek baar phir se china virdohi sur alapa jane laga he
 Before Deepawali, social media has been filled with reactions to the Made in China stuff and as of last year, there may be debate on mainstream media soon
 lekin aarthik aankadon par najar daalen to beete teen varshon ke dauraan china ko chunauti dene ke liye bhi hamaari majaburi bharat-china aarthik rishton ko or majboot karne kii he
 Therefore, the Modi government has left no stone unturned to strengthen economic relations with China during the last three years
 bharat-china vyapaar ke aankadon ko dekhen to saaf he ki china kii bharat main paith pataakhon se kahin zyada gahari he
 Import of firecrackers from China will not be even one million dollars
 videsh vyapaar ke aankadon ke mutabik, china se bharat kaa sabase bada aayaat electronics (20 arab dollar), newclear riector or mashinari (10
 $ 5 billion), Chemicals ($ 6 billion), Fertilizers (3
 2 arab dollar), steel (2
 3 billion dollars)
 2016-17 main hamane china se lagbhag 72 arab dollar kaa aayaat kiya
 It was $ 61 billion in 2015-16
 china ke baad bharat kaa sabase bada aayaat america, saudi arab or emirate se hota he
 But imports from China are more than imports from these three countries
 ise bhi padhein: china se len sikh: raakhi ke saath in tyohaaron main bada kaarobaari maukaayaat ke saath bad rahaa vyapaar ghataalekin bharat kaa sabase bada trading partner hone ke baavjood bharat-china vyapaar desh ke liye sabase badi chunauti bhi he
 Import-export between the two countries is completely in favor of China
 72 arab dollar kaa aayaat karne ke saath hi pichley saal china ko hamane mahaj 21 arab dollar kaa niryaat kiya tha
 Therefore, the trade between the two countries has caused a trade deficit of about $ 51 billion to the Indian exchequer
 yah ghaataa lagaataar badhata rahaa he or mana ja rahaa he ki is raftaar se yah ghaataa badhata rahaa to bahut jald desh ko 100 arab dollar kaa vyapaar ghaataa dekhne ko milegaa
 This is because while our dependence on most items of import is on China, Indian products are not easily found in China
 ise bhi padhein: china bharose modi kii saubhaahgya yojana, 24 ghante bijli ke liye 10 karod dollar karj ko manzooristachu of unity maid in chinagujarat sarkaar ne 2010 main narmada nadi ke kinare sadhu bet tapu par sardaar patel kii 182 meter oonchi murti lagane ke manjuuri di thi

 Major Chinese companies include Huawei and ZTE in this import
 iske chalate samooche bhartiya telecom sector par china kii companiyon kaa dabadabaa kaayam he
 About 51 percent of the mobile handset market in India is in favor of Chinese companies and the Indian market is dominated by Geomi, Oppo, Vivo and oneplus
 30 fisadi hydro or 87 fisadi solar urja par china kii dhakurja ek anya sector he jahaan bharat puri tarah se china par ashrith he
 According to the 12th Plan, about 30 percent of the total power generation capacity in the country has been imported from China
 vahiin beete ek varsh ke dauraan desh ke saura urja kshetra main china se aayaat mashinari ke chalate uskaa 87 fisadi bazaar par kabja he
 The plan to increase FDI from China is constantly trying to bridge the ever-widening trade deficit from China
 modi sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki vyapaar ghate ke itane bade antar ko paatane ke liye behad jaruri he ki china kii companiyon kaa bhartiya bazaar main bada nivesh karaayaa jaae
 In this regard, Nirmala Sitharaman, who was formerly Commerce Minister, issued a statement in the Rajya Sabha in 2014 that to reduce the trade deficit from China, it is very important that Chinese companies make big investment in India's manufacturing sector
 isse china se aayaat kii tulana main bharat se china ke niryaat main ijapha dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 Along with accelerating the manufacturing capacity of India from Chinese FDI, it can also manufacture those products which are in demand in China
 yun bad rahaa he china kaa bharat main niveshbharat sarkaar ne china ke nivesh se desh ke kaarobaari hub maharashtra or gujarat main esaijed nirmit karne par qaraar kiya he
 The respective state governments have entered into agreements with China for these sezs
 maharashtra sarkaar ne pune main industrial park ke liye china kii company bikeephotone motors se qaraar kiya he
 At the same time, an agreement has been signed between Gujarat Government and China Development Bank for industrial park in Gujarat
 ek or qaraar gujarat sarkaar or china ke laghu or madhyam industrial nivesh limited dwaara kiya ja chukaa he jiske tahat gujarat main multiprpaj industrial park kaa nirmaan kiya janaa he
 It is clear that the 'nationalist' boycott of firecrackers and electricity fighters coming from China is not going to show any effect
 bharat kii arthvyavastha ke liye china ke bahishkaar se jaruri chini companiyon kaa satkar he taaki mek in india ko safal banaaya ja sake
 By adopting the technology used by Chinese companies, India could also become a manufacturing hub and increase imports by reducing exports from abroad
 tabhi donon deshon ke bich ke vyapaar ghate ko pata ja sakegaa or sahi myne main arthvyavastha ke achche din aaenge

 Judicial activism, which started against the executive in the 90s, could not even defend itself before the same executive in the year of 2014
 is imtahaan main karypalika ne apana khoyaa hua niyantran vaapis le liya yaa phir nyaaypalika pehle se or behatar ho gai he, is par kanoon ke vidwaan lambey samay tak bahes karenge
 Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad while presenting the Constitution Amendment Bill for the National Judicial Commission called it historic
 samvidhan kanoon or sansthaaon par nazar rakhane vaale loktantric praaniyon ke liye vaaki aaj kaa din aitihaasik he
 In what form it is historical, it can be a subject of debate
 supreme court or 24 hoicourt ke jajon kii niyukti tabadalaa or pramotion ke liye ek ayog banegaa jiskaa sankshipt naam hoga engeesi, yani rashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog ke mukhiya honge bharat ke pradhan nyaayadhish
 The law minister, two senior judges of the Supreme Court, two distinguished citizens will be its members
 pratishthit sadsy koun honge, kaise banenge or kab tak rahenge, isaki sharten di gayi hai
 NGAC has been given constitutional status so that the government cannot make any changes in it
 engiesi ke 6 main se 2 sadsy kisi ummidavaar par sahamat nahin he, to niyukti nahin hogi
 The President may return the NGAC proposal for reconsideration, but the President will have to agree if the panel unanimously sends the proposal
 supreme court kaa varisht jaj hi pradhan nyaayadhish banegaa, lekin vah niyukti cameti kii baithak main bhaag nahin legaa
 If you have heard Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad speaking in the Lok Sabha today, you would have seen the lawyer and politician within him competing with each other
 acha bhaashan diya
 The committee, which will appoint two civilian members of the new commission, will be a member leader of the opposition or the leader of the largest party in the Lok Sabha, that is, the law minister also reduced the troubles of the Congress
 yah praavdhaan lokapal se lekar chunaav ayog kii niyuktiyon ke liye bhi nazir banegaa
 The Law Minister said that the new bill hinges on the equal sharing and respect of the powers of Parliament and the judiciary, but in the new commission, the primacy of the judiciary should remain, for this the Chief will be the Chief Justice and there will be two judges
 saath hi jin do vyaktiyon kii niyukti ke liye cameti banegi uske bhi sadsy chif justise hi honge
 The government will accept the proposal that the commission sends
 puure bhaashan main ravishankar prasad is baat ko lekar satark the ki kahin unki kisi baat kaa matlab nyaaypalika ke adhikaar kshetra main dakhlandaazi na samaj liya jaae
 Therefore, he mentioned in detail that before the introduction of this bill today, there have been attempts to amend the Constitution four times in twenty years, seven times various committees have suggested in detail
 kanoon mantri ne samvidhan nirmaataa doctor ambedkar ko kot kiya ki kaise ve jajon kii niyukti ke maamle main raashtrapati, bharat ke pradhan nyaayadhish or sansad main se kisi bhi ek ko sarvocch adhikaar dene ke paksh main nahin the
 The 1993 Supreme Court decision that started the collegium system
 vah faisla dene vaale divangat justise jees verma ke us bayaan kaa zikr bhi kiya gaya, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki nyaaypalika ne unke faisle kaa galat matlab samaj liya
 Ravi Shankar Prasad says that the old system of appointing judges from 1950 to 1993 worked very well
 aaj colegium se pehle kaa koi jaj nahin he
 i ask the question why there are no judges like VR Krishna Iyer today
 echaar khanna jaise jaj kyon nahin hai? bijan mukherjee, vivien bose esaaar das jaise jaj kahaan hai? us system main kamiyaan thim to legend bhi aae
 When Ravi Shankar Prasad was giving these examples, i noticed that the central or state governments appoint lawyers on their panel in a professional manner or on the basis of political choice
 use bhi kyon na paardarshee banaaya jaae
 i am not able to do this, but is our Law Minister saying that in the current collegium system, since 1993, no such judge has been formed, who can be named
 kya 1993 ke baad se supreme court ne aitihaasik faisle nahin die
 From the 2G scam to other scams, the story of sending politicians to jail from industrialists is not registered in this system
 kanoon mantri ek or udhaaharan dete hai, jabalpur hoicourt ke chif justise jeepi singh jinaki kitaab kii misaal di jaati hai, vah supreme court main nahin aa sake
 Will have to think on this
 kanoon mantri ne purv justise katju ke kisi bhi aarope yaa udhaaharan kaa zikr nahin kiya, lekin unke apane udaahranon ke jawaab main koi yah puch saktaa he ki kya supreme court main ve log jaj ban gaye, jo chif justise jeepi singh se kam kaabil the
 When former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court SH Kapadia retired in 2012, Forbes magazine wrote that 'justice Kapadia Pilgrim of Justice' means Pilgrim of Justice
 hindu ne sitambar 2012 main likhaa ki kapadia kaa kaarykaal oonche ohadon par bhrashtachar ko nishaanaa banane ke liye yaad kiya jayega
 India Today wrote that Justice Kapadia retired by restoring confidence in the judiciary
 diene ne likhaa 'a chif justise of india hu brids integrity'
 Also keep in mind that some Chief Justices are also directly or indirectly accused
 haal ke dinon main justise katju ne nyaaypalika main bhrashtachar ke kai prasangon kaa zikr kiya or kai maamalon main bataaya ki colegium ke mukhiya ke naate chif justise ne kadam nahin uthaaye
 In one case, he has also mentioned former Chief Justice Kapadia
 somvaar ko supreme court main colegium system ke khilaaf janhit yachika par sunwaayee thi
 Defending the system, the current Chief Justice RM Lodha said that the image of the judiciary is being tarnished deliberately under a campaign
 main is colegium system se niyukt jajon ke pehle batch kaa hum or justise nariman aakhri jaj honge
 If the collegium system has failed, then we have all failed
 jaldi hi colegium system itihaas ban jayega
 Will the new system be able to create history that was allegedly not made of collegium
 aap jaanate hai ki 1993 ke baad se supreme court kaa colegium jajon kii niyukti karata he
 Now the National Judicial Appointments Commission will do it

 Kohli, who learned the nuances of cricket from former Ranji player Rajkumar Sharma at West Delhi Cricket Academy, is being considered the future captain

 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle congress ko bahut badi ranneetik jeet mili he
 The support of Hardik Patel, Jignesh Mevani and Alpesh Thakor, who have become the hallmark of youth dissatisfaction, have been seen in Gujarat, and Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is seen getting support
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki gujarat kii janata in chaar yuva netaaon - rahul, hardik, alpesh or jignesh ko haathon-haath leti he yaa nahin
 The four young leaders have put Modi's Gujarat model in mind and the Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in the country by presenting the model of development of his home state Gujarat
 vikaas ko apane har chunavi abhiyaan kaa naaraa bana chuki bijepi ke liye aage bhi gujarat model hi sahaara hoga
 But the manner in which these four young leaders have opened up the box of problems like reservation, liquor ban, unemployment and Dalit oppression in Gujarat during the last few months has made a dent in this Gujarat model of Modi
 patidaaron ke maseehaa ke taur par ubhare hardik patelpatel anamat andolan ke jariye hardik patel ko pradesh hi nahin balki desh main nai pahchaan mili
 Born in Ahmedabad's Viramgaon, Hardik is still 24 years old, but the way the Patidar community gathered millions in his rallies, his strength in Gujarat politics can be gauged
 sabase ahm yah he ki gujarat main patidaaron kii aabaadi 18 fisadi he or rajya kii 182 vidhansabha siton main se 70 siton par patel samudaay kaa prabhaav he
 The Patel community of the state has been a traditional BJP voter for the last two decades, which is currently being considered angry
 isi kaa nateeja rahaa ki 2015 main hue jila panchayat chunaav main saurashtra kii 11 main se 8 par congress vijayi rahi or bijepi ko karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The brutal beating of youths of Dalit community by upper caste people in Una, Jigneshgujrat, which symbolized the voice against Dalit oppression from Una, attracted the attention of the entire nation towards the oppression of Dalits in Gujarat
 jignesh peshey se vakil or saamaajik kaaryakarta hai
 Jignesh led the movement against the beating of Dalits in the name of cow protection in Una
 jignesh ne wo kaam kar dikhaaya, jisase dalit samaaj sadiyon se mukt hona chahta tha
 The manner in which the Muslim community, apart from the Dalits, united with the 'independence movement' started by Jignesh in favor of the Dalits, has certainly raised concerns on the bjp's forehead
 gauratlab he ki gujarat main saat fisadi dalit aabaadi he
 OBC face Alpesh joins Congress; Alpsh, who emerged as the new delegate of the OBC community having good influence in more than 60 seats in Gujarat, met Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi in Delhi on Saturday and announced to support Congress soon
 
 alpesh kii pahchaan teen saal pehle thakor sena se bani thi
 Despite liquor prohibition in Alpesh, Gujarat made easy-to-use country liquor a big issue
 alpesh kii aguai main thakor sena ne madhya or uttar gujarat main desi sharaab ke thikaanon par 'janata red' karnaa shuru kiya
 Alpesh also took up the issue of unemployment of a large number of youths in Gujarat with the de-addiction campaign
 alpesh ne saath hi thakor sena kaa dayera badhaate hue puure obisi samaaj ko bhi isamen jod diya
 There are 146 castes of OBC society in Gujarat, which hold their influence in more than 60 seats
 alpesh ne gujarat ke kareeb 80 dehaat kii vidhansabha siton par booth str par prabandhan kaa kaam kiya he
 OBC voters have been with the BJP for the last several elections, but the OBC community has been angry for some time
 alpesh isi naaraazgi ko cash karaane ke mood main hai
 Rahul's style has changed - now let's talk about Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 congress ab tak rahul gandhi ke netritv yaa unke karishme ke boote koi chunaav nahin jeet pai he
 But for the past few days, Rahul's new face has been seen
 gujarat main unki reliyon main na sirf apaar bheed jute rahi he, balki unke bhaashanon main bhi nayaa chutilaapan aayaa he
 Rahul Gandhi will now be seen sharing the stage with Alpesh at Alpesh's public meeting in Gujarat on 23 October
 aane vaale dinon main rahul jab gujarat ke in yuva netaaon ke saath manch saajha karenge, to dekhne vaali baat hogi ki gujarat kii janata inhen kaise leti he
 The Congress is not only trying to return to Gujarat through these young leaders, but through Gujarat it is also trying to shine the political image of Rahul Gandhi
 kareeb ek dashak se zyada vakt hua jab maine desh ke vibhinn or sudur hisson main chunaavon ke dauraan apni saghan yatraaen shuru kii thim jisamen main kabhi-kabhaar padosi deshon tak main gaya
 i have been writing the experiences gathered from there in my column 'walls Bolti Hai'
 jaisaa ki naam se spasht he, ye deevaaron par likhi ibaaratein hi hoti hai
 These often include graffiti, signboards, hoardings, advertisements that help you understand a changing area
 yah sab milakar haalanki ek muhaavara bhi gadhate hai jise paane ke liye aapako puraane kism kii reporting ke taur-tareeke apanaakar ghoomana hota he, padhuya hota he, logon se baat kerani hoti he or apni indriyaan khuli rakhkar anubhavon ko aane dena hota he
 In this series, the changes in the entire Hindi-speaking region, North, East, West and South have been recorded in a time bound manner and all important states have come under its purview
 iskaa iklauta apwaad dilli he jahaan main rahata hum or vot daalata hum
 The question arises whether Delhi is an important state
 Is that state also? Its prized Lutyens share is under the central government
 isaki jameen or police (jin do chizon se har mukhyamantri apana prabhaav jamaata he) bhi centre ke adheen hai
 Delhi sends only seven mps to the Lok Sabha, which is slightly more than half of the parliamentary seats in the neighboring small state of Haryana while less than a tenth of neighboring Uttar Pradesh
 dilli ke bheetar shahari satta or jimmedaari kaa adhikansh chune hue nagar nigamon ke adheen he
 In this way, the elected government of Delhi is a kind of bonsai who has all the constraints of a government but whose reach and strength is not as much as that of a real political entity
 phir bhi vah dilli kii sarkaar he isliye ahm he, jaisaa kabhi akashwani main bajane vaala ek gaanaa tha—dilli he dil hindustan kaa
 
 
 
 pichley dinon main jo baat bauddhikta or vichaaron par lagu hoti thi, aaj vah rajnatik satta par lagu hoti he
 For example, we used to say that India thinks only what Bengal thinks today
 isi tarj par ham kah sakate hai ki aaj dilli par jo raaj karegaa, vahi kal bharat par raaj karegaa
 Obviously, the changes that take place over time in this phrase will undoubtedly be recorded
 sattar ke dashak ke madhya se lekar aaj tak sirf ek apwaad ko chhod den to ham pate hai ki jis bhi party ne dilli vishvavidhyalay ke chaatrasangh kaa chunaav jeeta he, usee kii jheli main dilli kii saat main se zyaadaatar loksabhaa siten ai hai
 It has hardly happened that the party which won in Delhi could not rule India
 yahaan tak ki 1999, 2004, 2009 or ab 2014 main bhi yahi sidhaa-sapaat chalan kaayam rahaa he
 Now we have to add an additional condition to this is the rise of Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party which is in direct competition with BJP
 yah kahana to betuka hoga ki ateet kaa chalan khud ko doharayega or agar aam aadmi party kii dilli main jeet hui to bhavishya main vah bharat par raaj karegi
 It may be that he will make a big change after the victory and by establishing himself as an alternative national force, oust the Congress from the moderate left ideological popular space and create a much bigger crisis for Narendra Modi
 Give
 jeet bijepi kii hui, to usase modi kii satta ko takat milegi, yah pushti hogi ki modi kii lahar kaayam he or phir ve congress se zyada taqatvar chunautiyon ko bhi darkinar kar paane main sakasham honge
 Delhi is so important and Kejriwal is such a tough opponent that he has forced Modi to change his strategy and equation
 modi ke netritv main aisa pehali baar hua he ki unki party unke naam par vot maangane kii bajaae ek mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa saamne rakhkar chunaav main utar rahi he
 This will serve a dual purpose
 ek to dilli ko kiran bedi ke rup main kejariwal ke baraabar nijee pratishtha vaala ummidavaar mila he
 Secondly, in the event of adverse situation, there is also scope for Modi to take the option
 dilli rashtriya raajnneeti ke vyapak tarj par chalati to uskaa akalan karnaa zyada aasaan hota
 Then it could not even present this challenge for Modi
 chaar rajyon ke chunaav samet pichley 15 maheenon main hue har chunaav main dilli ke matadaata ne modi or unki party ko jamkar vot diya he, phir chaahe vah kahin se bhi aata ho, uski koi bhi jati yaa jaateeyata rahi ho
 Most of the expatriates in today's Delhi are from Hindi speaking states and Haryana and some old Punjabis live here
 yah prati vyakti aay ke maamle main desh kaa sabase amir rajya bhi he or sabase acchhee sadakon (sabase kam kharaab bhi kah sakate hai), metro, dasiyon hajaar bason, harith kshetra, skulon, collejon ke maamle main yah sabase aage he
 In Delhi, however, identity does not matter much
 aisa is kaaran se nahin he ki yahaan ke shaharikaran ne kisi samaveshi vaataavaran ko janm diya ho balki yah isliye hua he kyonki dilli kii raajnneeti ko yahaan kii aarthiki tay karti he
 To take the right picture of Shahardilli that thrives on shopkeeping, it requires vision and descriptive strength like Suketu Mehta to write a thick book on it
 main to sirf deevaaron par likhi ibaaratein dekhne tak simit hum, lihaaja mere gyaan chakshu kholane ke liye purvi dilli main akshardham metro stesan ke saamne laga khambha hi kaaphi he jisase main samaj paata hum ki dilli aakhir sabase alag kyon he
 The pillar is advertised by a developer who sells shops and has a message: The rupee does not grow on trees, it grows in shops
 aap purvi dilli sthit nirdhantam jamanapar ilaake main trephic or logon kii bheed ko chirate hue ghuste jaaie or vahaan jaakar sabji, icecream, pakora bechney waalon, property agenton or chote dukandaaron or auto chaalkon se baat kariye
 Nearly everyone in the area sells something after office
 din main ye naukariyaan karte hai lekin usase kamai bahut kam hoti he
 Families, growing children, marriage, and indomitable ambition to live a better life require more money
 yah ek tareeke se sambhav nahin he
 All the people engaged in government jobs, even peons, Daftaries and Chowkidars also come home with some cash
 yah rajdhani ek bhrasht shahar he jahaan ek file le jane, ek darwaja kholane or kisi se phone par baat karwaane kii bhi ek keemat hoti he
 People engaged in property business here will tell how corrupt the lower and middle class government employees are
 ek vishwasaneey anumaan ke mutabik kareeb paanch lakh sarkari karmchaaree rojaanaa apni jeb main 5,000 ru
 They return home on average
 ye paise unhen kharch karne hai lekin ve ise bank nahin le ja sakate
 They also cannot increase their lifestyle or else people will be suspicious
 jo bachate hai, unamem yaa to mutthi bhar eemaandaar sarkari karmchaaree hote hai yaa phir kam tankhwaah paane vaale nijee kshetra ke karmi—ye log dusron ko vah nakad kharch karne main madad karte hai
 This money is spent in food, entertainment, new fancy phones and beauty parlors
 aap dilli ke nimna or nimna madhyavargeey ilaakon main chale jaaen to aap paaenge ki yahaan har aadmi ek dukandaar he
 There is a business going on from every house - from food and drink to tailoring and tuition to homeopathy
 dilli dohari aay vaala shahar he or yah duusari aay rishwat athwa bakhshish se nahin aati to gharelu udhyam se aati he
 Money flows from this business and shopkeeping in Delhi and its customers are people whose income is in cash
 ab aap samaj gaye honge ki vah khambha kyon ankhen kholane vaala he: paise pedo par nahin ugte, dukaane main ugte hai
 There are few industries or resources in Delhi
 yahaan nakad kaa sabase bada strot sarkaar he or yahaan kaa sabase bada pesha dukandaaree he
 Babugiri and Muktagiri is the reason why the driving forces of Delhi are greed, ambition and an aggressive, rough insensitivity that is not found in any other city in the country
 dilli ke purvi kone main mandavali main rahane vaala chauthe darje kaa ek karmchaaree netaa kahata he, “saraji, ham swatantraaa senaniyon ke shahar ke rahane vaale hai
 Freedom fighter in his dictionary means a person who wants everything for free, from transportation to electricity, education, water and even wi-fi
 dilli main kejariwal ke ubhaar kii vajah yah he ki unhone dilli ke garib-gurbon kaa dimag achche se pard liya he: yahaan ke votaron ke liye paise kii ahmiyat vahi he jo baaki jagahon ke votaron ke liye pahchaan kii he
 They want every goods or service from the government for free
 isiilie samooche shahar main ni:shulk wiphoi kaa unka vichaar behtareen he
 Of course they count the more advantages: like every woman's mobile phone will have an application connected to the wifi so that she can inform the nearest police station in anticipation of any danger
 isamen haalanki yah maanakar chalaa gaya he ki sadak par chalane vaali, parivahan se chalane vaali or kaarysthal par maujuud har mahila ke paas mobile phone hoga
 By the way, Delhi is not a poor city, so it is not even a politics wooing in the name of free
 congress ne sabase pehle is baat ko samajha tha jab usne matadaataaon kii is khuraaq ko puraa karne ke liye mafia ke saath gathjod karke karodon logon ko sarkari jameen luutane kaa mauka diya, jin par avaidh coloniyaan basaa di gayi or jahaan aaj aadhi se zyada dilli rahati he
 Delhi's 2008 election was won by the Congress on the promise of regularizing these colonies, but made no fresh attempts in 2013 when people were plagued by rising electricity, water and transport prices
 unka maananaa he ki in sevaaon kii nunatam keemat vasuuli jaani chahie
 Kejriwal understood this, so to raise votes, he gave slogan of cheap electricity, free water, education, a house for every family
 muft wiphoi isi kadi main upar ke tabake ko lubhaane vaala naaraa he
 His hoardings have written: Degree, Income, Wifi
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki aaj kii dilli main roti, kapadaa or makaan kaa matlab shiksha, paisa or sampark sanchaar he
 Kejriwal was the first to unravel this mystery, so today he remains such a strong challenge
 lokapriy raajnneeti ke dhandhe main unhone congress jaise puraane dhurandharon ko kaaphi peeche chhod diya he
 Now Congress is promising to provide free sewer connections in homes
 isaki aap degree, aay or wiphoi se tulana kiijie, fark samaj main aa jayega
 If money is the biggest measure of the identity of Delhiites, then it is the money that divides Delhi in terms of geography and architecture
 dakshini dilli raison or kulinon kii he
 South-central Delhi is the richest and most powerful
 pashchimi dilli sampann he jiske paas sirf paisa he or paise kii bhukh he
 This is followed by poor north and east Delhi
 in sabake bich thakee-haari parcote vaali puraani dilli he jo dhahne ke kagaar par he
 Delhi does not have slums according to Mumbai
 iske adhiktar voton par kejariwal kaa kabja he
 They themselves believe that there are close to five million slums in Delhi, although on a real scale those who are considered to be slums here and who are J
 je
 The colony has been called, their number will be half
 inke alaava dilli main avaidh coloniyon kii vyapak bharmaar he—dakshini dilli main sangam vihaar se lekar uttari dilli main buraadi tak—or kuch to sirf naam kii vaid coloniyaan hai, jaise purvi dilli main mandavali-vinod nagar
 In search of the writings on the walls in my country and in Pakistan, in the maximum sub-city, i have drawn pictures on my phone with great disinterest to help my illustrator in drawing, and in return the worse and any reaction from this curiosity to me Not found: Who is this idiot who takes pictures of hoardings, paintings on the wall and it doesn't even look like a Japanese? But every time people pick up the phone to take a picture in their Delhi, people start looking at me with suspicion
 lagbhag har vyakti ne avaidh rup se nirmaan yaa apane gharon main vistaar kiya hua he or ve is chintaa se ghir jate hai ki main kahin kisi sarkari adhikari yaa court dwaara niyukt nirikshan cameti ke liye saboot to nahin juta rahaa hum
 Poor governance over land and Congress-style electoral politics have forced three-fourths of the city's population to live as illegal in one form or the other
 lihaaja, kuch to nihaayat avaidh ilaake hai—sabase garib buraadi se lekar sampannatam sainik famrs tak
 The semi-legitimate non-elite section forms the vast lower class of Delhi and loves Kejriwal very much
 dilli kii avaidh coloniyaan ek myne main mumbai ke slam kaa jawaab hai
 Better than common slums but illegal, bereft of facilities and run by mafias
 apni aasaan sahuuliyat ke liye ham inhen super-slam kaa naam de dete hai
 In most parts of Delhi, such as the East, various economic classes live shoulder to shoulder
 inamen jo sampann hai ve apane aapako pinjaron main kaid kar dete hai—apni balakaniyon or khule ilaakon main badsoorat sariyon kii frem khadey kar daalate hai taaki khud ko taaka-jhaanki karne vaale, garib padosiyon or utpaati bandaron, donon se bachaa saken
 This is Delhi's original, frightening concept of gated communities
 “meraa kahana alag he lekin aapkaa inhen nichalaa varg kahana galat he,” kejariwal ne mujhase kaha
 The last communication between us was a year ago
 tab hamane bahes kii thi, pehle to anna andolan par or phir—jab maine unke gaddamdd, gahare loklubhaavanavaad ko dekha or unhone apane vyaktitv or raajnneeti ko lekar meri naapnsadagi ko
 But now he is more solidly political, thick skinned, and as i anticipated in his recent publication Anticipating India — he has found mainstream peace
 “dilli main do varg hai
 One that directly benefited from our 49-day rule - the decline in subsidies, price drop and petty corruption
 ise hi aap galat tareeke se nichalaa varg kehete hai
 He has also forgiven us for our hasty resignation last time
 ” doosraa varg, ve kehete hai, madhya va ucch varg he, ab bhi ashankit he
 "no one was willing to accept that we should have resigned on the issue of Lokpal bill
" ” so, unka naaraa he—paanch saal, kejariwal
 He has done a great job in building an organization and has gathered talented people who also beat the BJP in the strategy
 unki yuva team ne chunavi kushti khelte hue unki kamajoriyon ko takat main badal diya he
 Previously his muffler used to be made fun of, now it has become a style-statement
 ''meri soshal media team mafalaraman ke hashtag ke saath utari or yah maheene bhar tak trend karata rahaa,” ve kehete hai
 His constant cough was also made fun of
 isliye ab vah khulkar mike par khansate hai maano apana paksh rakh rahe hon
 He is called an absconder, so he himself confesses this at the beginning of his campaign speech and apologizes for it
 lekin mul baat yah he ki dilli ko unhone baaki logon se behatar samaj he
 The offer of free wifi is an introduction to this occasional ability
 vidambnaa kii baat yah he ki dilli kaa nichalaa varg apane yahaan ke abhijatya tabake se zyada samaveshi or sahishnu he
 The populations of poor areas mix more easily with their places and opportunities
 aapako halaal (musalmaan) meet kii dukaan ke thik saamne jhatka (hindu) meet kii dukaan mil jaaegi
 Nihari serving barkat bread and hill Hindu dhaba will be found side by side
 jaise-jaise log agal-bagal or hawa main avaidh manzilen or vistaar badhaate ja rahe hai, aise main zyaadaatar galiyon main ghoomana kancreet va steel ke bane jangalon main ghoomane jaisaa he
 a glimpse of the sky can be seen from the front windows, balconies and air conditioners (yes, these are not poor areas)
 ve sab kuch chaahate hai—apane asi ke liye bijli samet, lekin ve uske liye paisa nahin chukaana chaahate
 They are also fundamentally anti-establishment
 paaramparik trade union andolan to khatm ho chuke, lihaaja kejariwal ye teenon chijen lekar aate hai—muftakhori, takat or avagya
 Kejriwal has also prepared his economics very carefully
 vah kehete hai, koi bhi jhuggi basti main rahanaa nahin chahta, lekin koi bhi shahar se tees mile dur bhi nahin dhakela janaa chahta
 So they will run rehabilitation plans after studying different models
 ve kehete hai, ''ham dilli ko jhuggi basti main tabdeel nahin karenge lekin ham jhuggiyon main rahane waalon ko dilli se baahar bhi nahin phenk denge
 "the East is East and the contradiction between west-west-east and west-delhi is as incisive as between the candidates with whom i am going by turn
 kejariwal main aag or josh he, kiran bedi main chhavi va shanti
 Kejriwal has already settled and Bedi has been fielded by the country's most powerful party at this time
 jaahir he, yah badi kaante kii takkar he
 Whatever the people of Kejriwal are trying to give you, the Sangh / BJP base and workers are frozen with Bedi
 agar ve bedi ko bahari maanakar unka virodh bhi karte hai to yah jaahir nahin hota
 Arya Samaj Road located in West Delhi is just half a mile from the Sangh headquarters in Jhandewalan where i board a Bedi propaganda truck
 aapako mahasoos ho jaataa he ki aap pashchim dilli main hai jab pratyaashiyon ke aane par itane joardaar pataakhe phode jate hai ki ve jammu main biguef or pakistani rangers ke bich golibari sareekhe prathit hote hai
 And all this happens in a very pleasant atmosphere
 bedi apane prashansakon ke saath phulon-maalaon kii adla-badali karti hai
 Then someone climbs in front of the truck
 uske haath main ek peti he jo safed kabutaron se bhari he
 Bedi holds one of them in her hand and frees them amidst the thunderous sound of the people
 chunaav prachaar abhiyaan main kabutaron ko chode jane kaa pratik meri samajh ke baahar he
 But in West Delhi, if you have it, then show it gracefully and even if you don't, go to hell, still show
 agar suketu mehta ne mumbai ko hamaari maximum city kaha to, ham pashchimi dilli ko hamaari maximum sab-city kah sakate hai
 It is not that there is no diversity, but the work of fixing both style and sub-culture is different from the different areas — Patel Nagar, Kirti Nagar, Rajendra Nagar, Piragadhi, Mianwali and Rajouri Gardens

 punjabi sharnaarthiyon ne apni jindagiyon or sampannataa ko phir se khadaa kiya

 All the gods are in the same shop - it is certainly a brainchild of a Punjabi refugee
 pashchimi dilli ne dilli ko iskaa punjabi rang-dhang diya he—apane khaane, sampannataa, anth, cholesterol, celulite, dole, akl or tyoriyon se lakadak
 Virat Kohli, Shikhar Dhawan, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Ishant Sharma - what is the same in all of them? They are all from West Delhi
 purvi dilli kii hi tarah vahaan bhi har ghar main koi udhyam he or vah dashakon se fal-phool rahe hai
 Also, they are investing in property in South Delhi and in the new modern suburbs of Gurgaon and Noida

 Since they have earned a lot of money, they want status — they want to elevate their status in Delhi a bit

 notebandi ke baad 80 hajaar aise maamle saamne aae hai, jinamein inakam tex ritern file na kiye jane ke baad iskar vibhaag jaanch kar rahaa he
 This has been reported by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT)
 kendriya pratyaksh kar board (sibiditi) ke chairman susheel chandra ne buudhvaar ko yah jaankaree di
 He inaugurated the stall of the Income Tax Department at the Trade Fair at Pragati Maidan
 is maukey par unhone jaankaree di kiay kar vibhaagane 80 lakh aise logon kii pahchaan kii he, jinhone pichley teen saal ke dauraan apana ritern daakhil kiya he
 But this time it has not filed returns yet
 chandra ne kaha ki november, 2016 main huinotbandike baad desh main kar aadhaar badhaane main madad mili he
 He said that the net revenue of the country has also increased due to direct taxes from demonetisation
 chandra ne jaankaree di, ‘‘pichley saal pratyaksh karon kaa yogadan 52 fisadi or apratyaksh karon kaa yogadan 48 fisadi tha
 He said that it has happened many years later, when direct taxes contributed more than indirect taxes
 notebandi se kya madad mili? is sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue chandra ne kaha, 'main kahuunga ki paisabank khatonmen aa gaya
 This made it easy for us to find out how many people deposited the money, but did not file their returns
 'notebandi ke baad kii gai karrwai ke bare mencybiditipramukh ne bataaya ki aay kar vibhaag ne iske baad badi sankhya main logon ko email va esemes bheje

 These were constitutional notices

 uttar pradesh ke meerut jile main hawaii adda banaae jane kaa maamla siyaasi daanv-pech main ulajhata ja rahaa he
 The state government is still tight-lipped over the process of awarding land for the airport
 khaas baat yah ki sarkaar chaar shaharon main ni:shulk jameen dene ko taiyaar ho gai he, lekin meerut kaa pech fansaa hua he
 Union Minister Chaudhary Ajit Singh has taken the initiative regarding the airport in Meerut
 isko lekar kaaphi dinon se pradesh or centre sarkaar ke bich chitthibaji bhi chalati rahi he
 After Ajit Singh became the Minister of Civil Aviation, people hoped to become airports
 unki party rashtriya lokdal (areldi) ne lagaataar ise apane mudde ke taur prachaarit bhi kiya he
 It is believed that this is the only case in this whole matter

 Political analysts, however, also believe that in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, this strategy of SP should not be overshadowed in Meerut and surrounding districts
 khaastaur se tab, jab pichley vidhansabha chunaav main meerut or aasapaas ke jilon main sapa ko behatar parinaam mili the
 This time the strong minister of the state government, Shahid Manzoor is the SP candidate from Meerut Lok Sabha constituency

 sansad ke itihaas main ye mauka kam hi aayaa he jab kisi rajya ke mukhyamantri ke nidhan par shradhanjali ke baad karrwai ko sthagit kar diya gaya ho
 But Amma, the AIADMK chief, Jayalalithaa was moved away from the tradition and mourned following the recommendation of the central government
 kuch saansadon dabi jubaan se ek duusare se puch baithe ki jammu kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri or pi
 D
 pi
 Why did not this happen after the death of Chief Mufti Mohammad Saeed, a senior minister of the government responded to these questions, saying that Amma's height was very high, this honor is the same
 pidipi jo ki sarkaar kii sahyogi he or AIADMK sirf ek aisi party jiske saath narendra modi ke saath rishte achche hai
 But the difference lies in the trough of future politics where BJP wants to see itself and the party hopes to reach that role only by AIADMK
 shashikala hai aglaa bada cheharapradhanmantri narendra modi kaa jayalalita ke parthiv sharir ke paas unki khaas sahyogi shashikala ke sar par haath rakhkar dhankos badhanaa kai sanket detaa he
 It is clear that in the coming days, Sasikala will be playing the most important character in AIADMK
 ye baat kisi se chhipi nahin kii aspataal main jab jayalalita jindagi or maut se jujh rahi thi or charchaa is baat par jari thi kii aakhir unki viraasat ko aage kiske hatho main saunpa jaae to party or kader kii jubaan par ek hi naam tha shashikala
 In view of the ongoing court cases on its own, it is also necessary to have good relations with the Central Government at present and the BJP has its own need to support the AIADMK from the state to the national politics
 har mode par saath rahaa kendremma ke saath umade jansamarthan ko bhaanpate hue centre sarkaar ne aspataal se lekar antim sanskaar tak puraa kirdaar nibhaayaa
 While Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu was sent as the representative of the Center, many senior Union ministers continued to advise Jayalalithaa's aides about the constitutional crisis arising in the state
 rashtriya shok kaa elaan hua or tamaam mantri ammaa or modi ke sauhardpurn rishto kaa bakhaan karne lage
 Hoping for cooperation in the presidential election, the BJP now needs aiadmk's support not only for the next year's presidential election but also against the Congress and Mamata Banerjee-backed opposition
 isliye aane vaale samay main party ke ranneetikaar is koshish main rahenge kii kisi bhi tarah ammaa ke jane se AIADMK tut ke kagaar par pahunchakar vipaksh ko phayda naa pahuchaayen
 The advantage of the BJP is that it has stood with the AIADMK right from the beginning on the right-wing views in the politics of Tamil Nadu, divided in terms of views
 haalanki uske paas naa to rajya main ammaa yaa mjiaar jaisaa koi chamakta sitara he or naa hi diemke jaisaa cast combination, is khalipan ko bharna hi party ke liye chunauti he
 The sweet relations that Modi had with Modi are the same BJP whose leaders once sat on a dharna against Jayalalitha after being hurt by the arrest of Shankaracharya and this is the same party of Amma who was close to Sonia Gandhi when Atal Bihari Vajpayee government fell
 lekin game badlaanarendra modike pradhanmantri banane par jinke rishte ammaa ke saath raajnneetik taur par hameshaa madhur rahe he
 After coming to power, Modi made the AIADMK leader a deputy speaker in the Lok Sabha despite not being an ally, and Jaya passed the bill after a walkout by not putting the government in a dilemma on the GST bill despite opposition
 philhal rajya ke naemukhyamantri paneerselvamka lakshya party par apni pakad bananaa he or shashikala ko ammaa kii gairmaujuudagi main khud ko sabit karnaa he
 The competition between these two will give BJP a political advantage in the coming days
 zaahir he uski koshish kisi naa kisi tarah donon ke saath madhurata banane kii hogi tabhi ammaa ke liye panpi sahanubhooti kii nami par wo apni siyaasi fasal khadi kar paayegi
 After 2002, when Narendra Modi became the face of politics whose personality was carved on the model of development, then the shadow of communalism never gave up
 darasal, modi ke piem banane kii raah main bhi isi ko roda banane kii koshish rahi
 Now he is the Prime Minister, but it is widely discussed that there has been insecurity due to the arrival of Modi among the minority of the country
 vahiin, modi sabko saath lekar chalane kii baat karte hai
 In such a big question, how much PM Modi liked the mind of Muslims after 100 days? In the 9th session of Panchayat Aaj Tak 'muslim's Man Bhaye Modi', executive member of Jamaat ulema-e-hind and leader Maulana Mahmood Madani, Congress leader Rashid Alvi, CPM MP Mohammad Salim and BJP leader Seshadri Chari participated
 sawaal: modi jaise hi gujarat se dilli aae muslim asurakshit mahasoos karne lage
 Is this really it or is it perception? Madani: There is no insecurity in Muslim society
 asuraksha kisi ek ghatana kii vajah se ek ilaake main to ho sakati he, lekin puure desh main aisa nahin he
 Question: It is said that Muslims unite quickly on any one issue? Rashid Alvi: It is true that many political parties see Muslims as vote banks
 lekin ye kahana galat he kisi ek mudde par wo jhat se ek ho jate hai
 They are with different parties in each state
 haa, ye baat sahi he ki jab se ye sarkaar ai he tab se muslimon ko daraane kii koshish kar rahi he, lekin ve dar nahin rahe hai
 Question: What will be the benefit of intimidation? Rashid Alvi: Vote bank benefits
 modi ne japan main gita bhent kii bahut acchhee baat he
 But he also said that in my country, so-called secular people will be stressed
 main poochna chahta hum ki kya videshi jameen par modi kisi ek party, ek dal yaa ek samudaay ke pradhanmantri hai
 Madani: i am not afraid of anyone if i talk about myself
 is mulk ko kisi raajnneetik dal ne secular nahin balki janata ne banaaya he or ye desh hameshaa secular rahegaa
 Seshadri Chari: As far as the Bhagavad Gita is concerned, Modi ji has asked for the so-called secular people
 raashid alvi ji aapako zyada chintaa karne kii jarurat nahin he
 Yes, no community should be intimidated in the name of vote bank
 mohammad saleem:sampradayikta hamaari soch main he
 And election is playing a big role in it because the motive behind it is victory
 raashid alvi:bijepi ke teenon pravaktaaon shahanvaj hossain, mukhtaar abbaas nakvi or emje akbar ne dharm se baahar shaadi kii
 That is, if there is a different thing for the leaders of the party and if someone else does it, love jihad
 sheshadri chaari:main na jehad kaa export hum, na lav kaa
 Please spare me
 sawaal: kya dhara 370 par galati ho gai?sheshadri chaari:ham kehete hai ki chaahe dhara 370 ho yaa saamaanya naagarik samhita, charchaa honi chahie
 But as soon as Section 370 is mentioned, there is an uproar
 baaten hone lagati hai ki muslimon kaa maamla he, vot bank he
 We are saying to discuss
 raashid alvi:aap samvidhan kii baat karte hai, lekin aapke paas saamaanya naagarik samhita kaa blue print tak nahin he
 Why does the BJP not talk about Section 371, which gives special status to Arunachal and Nagaland
 aap kashmir ke logon se kyon nahin poochhate ki dhara 370 par wo kya chaahate hai
 Seshadri Chari: Article 370 is an issue not only with Kashmir but also with the country
 iskaa sambandh anya rajyon se bhi he, jo vahaan bijness karnaa chaahate hai
 With the withdrawal of Article 370, Kashmiris will benefit as much as the businessmen of Tamil Nadu
 kyonki abhi unke trek vahaan jaakar saamaan nahin bech sakate
 Rashid Alvi: Seshadriji, you believe that there is no disagreement between us and you that Kashmir is an unbreakable part of India
 to phir aap agar kashmir par koi faisla lenge to kashmiriyon se salaah lenge yaa nahin
 Seshadri Chari: i did not say do not ask Kashmiris
 dhara 370 par faisla puraa desh milakar legaa
 Ask Kashmiris also and ask Seshadri Chari sitting in Tamil Nadu
 aaj desh main maahaul he
 There should be talk on section 370
 sawaal: kya muslimon ke man bhaae modi?madani:modi ji hamaare pradhanmantri hai
 It has been just 100 days
 agar wo neeche ke logon ko thik rakhenge to shaayad is sawaal ko poochne kii jarurat nahin hogi

 At a time when the country is engulfed by an unbearable tide of emotions, reading Gandhi's memoirs will open a new vision
 gandhi ko sampoornataa main padhanaa aasaan nahin he kyonki maine vidhyaarthee jivan main kabhi padhaa tha ki duniya main nepolian bonapart ke baad agar kisi vyaktitv par sabase zyada sahitya likhaa gaya he to ve mahatma gandhi hai
 From my student life till date, the personality i have read the most and Guna, they are Mahatma Gandhi but it seems that our understanding of that Gandhi is zero
 bas gandhi kaa vyaktitv aisa he ki wo us shunya ke peeche khadaa hokar hamaare hausale ko das guna kar detaa he
 In his book, Arvind Mohan has tried to present that Gandhi in some way
 jab kathy tathy par baari padane lagata he or satya ko ham jaanboojhkar apni najaron se ojhal kar dete hai, tab gandhi ko yaad karnaa or aavashyak ho jaataa he
 For example, today when cow protection has become a measure of social reform, Gandhi emerges before us as a reflection of Goseva
 jab ek bachhda asay pidaa main tha, tab usko jehar kaa injection dekar mrityu kii god main sulaane kaa faisla gandhi hi kar sakate the
 i do not know what would have happened to our great 'nationalists' if they were today! Gandhi is the iron pillar of the past standing on the chest of the present on which he can stand and look at his future
 jab ham yah maanakar chalate hai ki satta hi samaaj, raashtra or sabhyataa ko bachaane kaa ekmaatr vikalp he tab is vikalp kii galatfahami ko gandhi todate hai
 Apart from the aspects of saintliness, one aspect of Gandhi is that of an absolute politician
 vah gandhi jab gulam hindustan kaa pratinidhi banakar jab british samrajya ke samraat se miltaa he tab ghutane bhar dhoti main or poochne par ki aise kapadey main kyon aae to kahata he ki mere hissaa kaa kapadaa bhi samraat ne hi pahan liya he
 He puts a question mark on the luxury of the Raj-prince in Gandhi Hindustan and becomes an interest of the common man
 vah gandhi hindu-musalmaan ke bich manovaigyanik, saamaajik or raajnneetik vibhed ko paatane main apni jindagi laga detaa he or uski keemat ke rup main uskaa 78 saal kaa boodha seenaa teen goliyaan jhelta he or yah desh yugon-yugon ke liye praayshchit kii aag
 Arvind Mohan in his book has tried to highlight these aspects only from Gandhi's life episodes without saying anything on his behalf
 raajnneeti kii kaajal vaali kothri main agar gandhi kaa shwet vasan bilkul bedaag rahaa to iske peeche kaise gandhi kii saamaajik kranti or nijee jindagi kii shuchita ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai, ye pahalu bhi is kitaab main khulegaa
 Who would have been a Hindu in this universe bigger than Gandhi? But against the evils of Hinduism, he raised his voice against casteism and untouchability, the pandas of Banaras set fire to his picture
 devgarh main kaala jhanda dikhaaya
 Bomb thrown in Pune, axed in Karachi
 gandhi is desh main brahmanwad ke viruddh sabase bada hastakshar the
 Gandhi was not killed by such people who were (are) the nurturers of Brahminism and took (are) under the guise of Hindutva
 bagaiyr apni taraf se koi khaas tippanee kiye bagaiyr arvind mohan ne gandhi ke vyaktitv ko logon tak pahunchane kaa prayaas kiya he lekin ye kitaab niraash bhi karti he
 The language of the book is such that a tenth fella has written while the writer has passed MA
 kai jagahon par vaakya-vinyas behad gadabad he
 Language fluency is lacking
 vartanee dosha sahaj bhav se miltaa he
 It is not easy to combine 150 years of the life of Gandhi and Kasturba into one hundred and fifty stories, but it may have a systematic behavior which was not followed
 aisa lagata he jaise is kitaab ko behad jaldbaaji main likhaa gaya he
 At least there should not be such haste on Gandhi because the endurance and self-control of which Gandhi fought all his battles is enough to inspire him to avoid impurities and speculations while writing about him
 saath hi kai prasangon ko naahak khinchaa gaya jabaki kai prasangon ko adhuraa chhod diya gaya
 Such as Gandhi's anguish at the death of Gandhi's secretary Mahadev Desai
 mahadev bhai ke nidhan par unki patni ko gandhi ne jo shok sandesh bheja, usamen likhaa tha ki tumko shok manaane kii koi jarurat nahin, kyonki tumse zyada vidhwaa to main ho gaya hum
 Keeping all these questions and references in mind, it is imperative that the next edition of this book comes soon
 philhal aap ek baar is kitaab ko jarur padhein kyonki aaj is desh ko gandhi kii sabase zyada jarurat he

 Buying and selling in electronic mode will reduce the possibility of tax evasion
 isse sarkaar ke paas paise honge jisase sarkaar vikaas kaaryon par kharch kare sakegi
 Apart from this, the record of transactions will be ready, which will also make it easier for the government to make plans at the credit facility

 -input bhashaa se Punjab cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, while holding the post as a minister, is thinking of ending the political uproar over the political uproar over Kapil Sharma's comedy show
 sutron ke mutabik punjab ke CM captain amarinder singh ne is maamle ko lekar punjab ke edwocket general atul nanda se legal opinian maanga tha or ab is maamle main navjot singh siddhu ko green signal dene kii taiyaari he
 According to the information received from Punjab Advocate General Atul Nanda, according to the off-record information, it does not appear that a case of Office of Profit or Conflic of Interest is made against Navjot Singh Sidhu and there is no legal case for him to work in TV
 Be intricate lekin kanoon ke jaankaron ke mutabikanvajot singh siddhuka mantri pad par rahete hue ek mantri ko milane vaali tamaam suvidhaon ko lete hue is tarah se paise kamaane kii daleel dekar ek nijee tivi channel ke kaarykram main shaamil hona naitikta or ek mantripad kii aachaar samhita ke hisaab se thik nahin he
 Sidhu refuses to quit comedy show, says - this is not a profit post

 According to Arora, in the case of Navjot Singh Sidhu, even though the Punjab government would say that it does not become a matter of Office of Profit or Conflict of Interest, but the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi has implemented the Model Code of Conduct for his Union Ministers
 agar wo model code of conduct punjab sarkaar bhi lagu kar detii he to aise main ye maamla aachaar samhita ke ulanghan kaa jarur hoga
 Navjot Singh Sidhu should refrain from working in morality TV shows on moral ground because of the kind of show he is working on, according to Krishna Abhishek Kakunan, who wants to make fun of Kapil Sharma on his show
 i will continue to grow this matter
 punjab sarkaar or duusare rajya sarkaron ke anya mantri, afasar or karmchaaree bhi navjot singh siddhu kaa ajampal dekar ye daleel de sakate hai ki wo bhi 9 se 6 ke apane sarkari kaamkaaj ko khatm karne ke baad koi bhi anya kaam kar sakate hai
 For this reason, Navjot Singh Sidhu should set aside his decision to work in a comedy show, setting an example as a role model and a politician

 According to Arora, according to the law, politicians holding constitutional posts are bound by the Code of Conduct
 aise main navjot singh siddhu ke tivi par kamedi sho karne kaa maamla offis of profit main bhale hi naa aata ho lekin code of conduct ke mutabik navjot singh siddhu TV par kisi kaarykram main shaamil hone kii evaj main paisa nahin le sakate
 In such a situation, Navjot Singh Sidhu should be stopped from doing TV shows
 ech
 C
 aroda ne saaf kar diya he ki agar unki apil ke baavjood navjot singh siddhu mantri pad par bhi rahe or TV main bhi kaam karte rahen to aise main wo punjab ke rajyapal se bhi isaki shikaayat karenge or saath hi punjab-haryana hoicourt main bhi is maamle ko lekar pitishan daakhil karenge
 So what will stop Kapil Sharma's show? According to Additional Solicitor General of the Government of India, Satyapal Jain, there is no such provision in the law or the constitution that Navjot Singh Sidhu can be prevented from going on TV shows while he is a minister
 pehle ye tay karnaa hoga ki kya navjot singh siddhu ke bataur mantri kapil sharma ke kamedi sho main jaakar kaam karne se or phir us kaam ke madhyam se channel yaa kapil sharma sho ke producers kii or se is pad kaa phayda uthaakar kisi khaas makasad ko hasil karne kii koshish to nahin kii ja rahi
 According to Satyapal Jain, this matter does not become an Office of Profit or Conflict of Interest, but it definitely becomes a matter of ethics and a minister's code of conduct
 navjot singh siddhu jis tarah se TV main kaam karne kii jid ko lekar ade hue hai or mantri pad par bhi bane rahanaa chaahate hai to isse aane vaale bhavishya main ek galat udhaaharan duusare rajanetaaon, afasaron or sarkari pad par baithe logon ke saamne diya ja rahaa he
 Even on Krishna Abhishek's show, Kapil's special guest will not come to the show, even on Amarinder Singh's statement of Navjot Singh Sidhu changing the tourism ministry to another ministry, Satyapal Jain said that this will not solve this problem and until As Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu is taking all government facilities, in such a situation, his morality and code of conduct will continue to be questioned that how he Live at Ri position have engaged in such a way to earn money through the TV show
 captain amarinder singh ke saamne majaburi ye he ki 10 saal baad punjab kii satta main pahunchi congress ke tamaam bade netaaon or khaastaur par navjot singh siddhu ko unhen saath lekar chalanaa he
 For this reason, on behalf of Captain Amarinder Singh, from the Advocate General through Legal Opinion, Navjot Singh Sidhu is ready to give a green signal to work in a TV show
 lekin jab tak navjot singh siddhu mantri pad par bane rahenge or saath main TV sho bhi jari rakhenge to aise main unki naitikta or ek mantri ke aachaar-vyavhaar ko lekar bahes bhi jari rahegi
 In such a situation, even the experts of law have given the opinion to Navjot Singh Sidhu to end this whole ruckus and concentrate on the ministerial post and while doing the responsibility of his ministry, do any other work and especially TV shows
 Avoid nirbhaya cese ke doshi pawan ko mondoli jail se tihaad kii jail nambar 2 main shift kiya gaya he

 dayaa yachika khaarij hote hi ye pehle grih mantralay phir dilli sarkaar phir tihaad jail ke paas jaaegi
 Tihar Jail will then tell the court that the mercy petition has been dismissed
 trial court uske baad deth warrant jari karegaa
 In 2014, in the case of Shatrughan Chauhan vs Union of India, the Supreme Court gave some guidelines regarding the execution
 deth warrant jari hone ke 14 din ke andar faansee deni hogi
 All the culprits have to be given a copy of the death warrant
 sabhi doshiyon ke gharavaalon ko bataanaa hoga
 All the convicts will be kept in the condom cell as soon as the death warrant is issued
 is cell main doshi baaki kaidiyon se bilkul alag ho jate hai or unki khaas nigaraanee kii jaati he
 However, if legal experts are to be believed, except Vinay, the rest of the convicts can go to the Supreme Court against the death warrant
 ye daleel de sakate hai ki unhone abhi dayaa yachika nahin lagaai he, lekin tihaad jail kahegaa ki sabhi ko dayaa yachika lagane ke ke liye 7 din kaa samay diya gaya tha
 That time has passed, so their plea has no meaning, but even after the death warrant is issued, the convicts have legal options
 isliye faansee antim sunwaayee tak tal bhi sakati hai
 It goes on to say that in 2015, the Supreme Court Judgment in Shabnam case said that the culprits can be hanged only when they complete all the legal remedies
 haalanki baaki teenon kii curative bhi baaki he
 In the death case, the Supreme Court usually waives the delay in the petition
