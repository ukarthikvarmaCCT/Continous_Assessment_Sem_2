 Why Modi gets caught in the trap of the Modi government every time, the Congress Government has increased the difficulty of the Congress by taking a sudden decision to remove Article 370 from Kashmir, which is also raising questions about the silence of Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi

 We wish that it does not collapse until the 2019 elections
 ' The Shiv Sena has accused the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of betraying 100 crore Hindus by the Attorney General at the UN Human Rights Council meeting in the United Nations for calling India a 'secular' country

 china, japan, srilanka or myanmar buddha dharm desh hai or america, rus samet puraa europe krischan he to phir bharat ko hindu raashtra kehane main kisi shame?shivasena ke mukhpatr main kaha gaya he ki hindu raashtra kii sankalpana ke liye lakhon hindu swayamsevakon ne ab tak balidaan diya
 The country has been annihilated by the word 'secular' ie secular, which has always been blamed on Nehru's forehead
 'saamana' main likhaa gaya he, 'sach to yah he kii yah desh hindu raashtra hi he
 The soul, culture, culture of the country is all that of Hindutva
 1947 main dharm ke naam par pakistan kaa nirmaan hone ke baad bachaa hua desh hindustan yani hindu raashtra hi mana janaa chahie
 The Shiv Sena said that even after the creation of Pakistan, about 2 crore Muslims remained
 unki khushaamad ke liye ham swayan ko 'dharmanirpeksh' kahalaane main dhanya samajhate rahe
 His 2 crores has become 22 crores today and these 22 crores are overshadowing us in the name of religion

 It is written in 'saamana' that if this country remains secular, then the construction of Ram temple ban on hypocrisy and cow slaughter will be a show and politics of votes
 'garv se kaho, ham hindu hai' waalon kaa raaj in dinon desh main he, phir bhi achaanak secular kaise ho gaye? is sarkaar par 100 karod hinduon ko dhokhaa dene kaa maamla darj hona chahie

 bharat ke kanoonee maamalon main adaalatein bhartiya dand samhita ke tahat karrwai karti hai
 But this did not happen in Jammu and Kashmir
 vahaan bhartiya dand samhita yani IPC kaa prayog nahin hota tha
 But after the removal of Section 370, now the IPC will be applicable in Jammu and Kashmir like the entire country
 ab yahaan yah samajhane kii zarurat he ki aakhir ranbir dand samhita kya thi?kya thi ranbir dand samhitabharat ke jammu kashmir rajya main ranbir dand samhita lagu thi
 Also known as Ranbir Code of Conduct
 bhartiya samvidhan kii dhara 370 ke mutabik jammu kashmir rajya main bhartiya dand samhita kaa istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 Only the Ranbir Penal Code was used here
 british kaal se hi is rajya main ranbir dand samhita lagu thi
 Actually, Jammu and Kashmir was an independent princely state before India became independent
 us vakt jammu kashmir main dogra rajvansh kaa shashan tha
 Maharaja Ranbir Singh was the ruler there
 isliye vahaan 1932 main maharaja ke naam par ranbir dand samhita lagu kii gai thi
 This code was similar to Thomas Babinton Macaulay's Indian Penal Code
 lekin isaki kuch dhaaraon main antar tha
 Ranbir was not in the Penal Code
 These laws explain and address the crimes committed through computer by Section 4 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), but there is no mention in the Ranbir Penal Code
 ipisi kii dhara 153 CAA ke tahat saarvajanik sabhaaon yaa jamaavadon ke dauraan jaan boojhkar shastr laane ko dandaneey aparaadh mana jaataa he, jabaki ranbir dand samhita main is mahatvapurn vishay kaa ullekh nahin he
 Under Section 195A of the IPC, if someone tortures someone for giving false testimony or statement, then he is considered to be entitled to punishment, whereas there is no instruction in this regard in the Ranbir Penal Code
 ipisi kii dhara 281 ke tahat jo vyakti kisi navikon ko prakaash, nishaan yaa perak main kaam aane vaale pahiyon se gumraah karata he, to vah sajaa kaa hakdaar he, jabaki ranbir dand samhita main aisa kuch nahin he
 Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code deals with deaths due to dowry, but is not mentioned in the Ranbir Penal Code
 ranbir dand samhita kii dhara 190 ke tahat sarkaar aise kisi bhi vyakti ko sazaa de sakati he, jo sarkaar dwaara amaanya yaa jabt kii gai saamagree kaa prakaashan yaa vitaran karata he
 In this case the Chief Minister has the right to determine the crime
 yah vishesh dhara patrakarita, soch, vichaar or abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ko buree tarah se prabhavit karti he
 These laws are not in the IPC
 According to Section 167A of the Bir Penal Code, any government employee who accepts payment of any contractor for the work of commission is entitled to legal punishment
 rishwatakhori se judi yah mahatvapurn dhara ipisi main maujuud nahin he
 Under Section 420A of the Ranbir Penal Code, the government, competent authorities or authorities determine the punishment for fraud or fraud that may occur in any settlement
 aisi spasht vyakhya ipisi main nahin he
 Section 204A of the Ranbir Penal Code clearly sets out the punishment for erasing or distorting evidence
 is vishay par aisa spashtikaran ipisi main nahin he
 Section 21 of the Ranbir Penal Code interprets the scope of a public job while the Indian Penal Code has limited scope

 This is also happening in Gurdwara, where the number of people eating food in the langar has increased since demonetisation
 isaki vajah bhi he kyonki parliament street, arabiai, pienbi, bank aaf badoda jaise baikon kii badi branch hai or isi ilaake main kai atm bhi he, jo lagbhag puure din kaam karte hai
 In such a situation, there is a huge crowd in these banks and atms, in the neighborhood there is Bangla Sahib Gurdwara, where the anchor runs from morning to night, just what else do people want, because people who are double-killed due to demonetization, neither leave here Don't worry about money or new notes, nor is there any struggle to eat full

 Many times there is a problem in the banks, so that people are engaged in the line in the early hours, but the cash runs out before their number comes, in such a situation, people come to the gurudwara, where their time also passes and the people in the langar They also eat a full meal
 langaramen khaanaa khaane aae sujith to teen dinon se lagaataar aa rahe hai, kyonki bank main kai ghante line main laganaa hota he, nai dilli ilaake ke bainkon main zyada cash hota he or suvidhaayen bhi zyada hoti he, aise main bhale hi line lambii ho, vakt zyada lagata ho, lekin paisa milane kii sambhaavna hoti he
 In such a situation, if there is hunger in the middle, then there is a great arrangement for it as an anchor
 mayapuri se aae subhash kumaar bhi bank se paisa nikaalane aae the, lekin bhukh lagi to gurudware chale aae
 According to Subhash, for the last five days, he did not go to work, there was money in the house, he was finished, there is no goods from the big note, in such a situation, if there is a provision to eat money with exchange of money, then what would be better than this

 ) Vijay Saraswat, head of India's Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), attended an anonymous aerospace seminar in Linköping, Sweden on 31 May as an honorary guest
 baad main is missile vaigyanik ne swedish ladaaku jet saab gripin main udaan bhari or sthaneey patrakaron ko dilachasp photo utaarne kaa bharpoor mauka bhi diya
 But, in the end, when Saraswat presented a design from his box, everyone was shocked, because no one had seen that thing before that day - they were involved in the design of a military project in India
 There were photographs, which were officially kept confidential until now
 is silsile main diardio yaa raksha mantralay kii koi or shakha shaayad hi kabhi kuch bataaegi
 These pictures were of the Indian Unmanned Aircraft Aircraft (IUSAV), code-named 'aura'
 'aura' unnat kism kaa ek aisa khufia bamavarshak he jo bharat dwaara is disha main kii gai kisi koshish se mail khaane kii bajaae sheet yuddh ke samay ke gupt prayogdharmi aircraft se zyada mail khaataa he
 As difficult as the development of such aircraft has been and the road to success, the mission behind preparing this IUSAV has been as simple: remote-operated flight by ground-based military personnel; Do not get caught even after enemies enter the airspace, even on the radar of enemies, it is not visible; Deploy the weapons of warhead to the target and return to their hideout
 ek sarkari dastavej main aura ko 'maanavrahit swa-suraksha gahan surveykshan aircraft' ke rup main bataaya gaya he jo is baat kii ore ishaara karata he ki chunki yah mixilon kii maar se bhi apana bachaav kar saktaa he, lihaaja iskaa istemaal jasusi ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 The DRDO has set a target of handing this highly complex and equally ambitious stealth bomber to the Indian Air Force within seven to eight years
 is gopneey aura kaarykram main philhal 100 karod ru
 Work on the design and design phase has been started with an initial budget of Rs
 kaarykram ke saath jude ek sheersh adhikari ne bataaya ki aironotical deveopment agency (edie)-jo agenciyon kaa ek samooh he jisamen diardio lab or hindustan aironautics limited shaamil hai-ko ummid he ki lagbhag ek arab dollar ke bajet ke andar is jatil pariyojna kaa kaaphi bada hissaa puraa ho jayega
 If seen, India does not have any specialization in the field related to the specific technology to make IUSAV useful, or even if it has a name, then DRDO has the most difficult and courageous challenge of aerospace
 isamen flying wing airodynamiks, radar ebjorbent paint or dhanchaagat saamagree, nishane ko saadhane ke liye dur se tainaat kiye jane vaale atyaadhunik hathiyaar or sabase ahm, jatil or abhedya sanchaar or data-link dhaancha, jisaki jarurat aise aircraft ko niyantran karne ke liye hoti he jisamen saikadon mile kii duuri se maar karne vaali sanhaarak misile dhoi jaati hai
 If the Indian aerospace establishment's recent performance in relation to indigenous aircraft is any indication, IUSAV can be called an audacious dream
 aise daawey ke saamne diardio apane bachaav main yah daleel rakhata he ki maanavrahit ladaaku drones ek adhikrut gopneey praudyogiki par aadhaarit he jise koi desh bharat ke saath kabhi saz nahin karegaa
 Of course there is merit in this, but it is also seen that France, Sweden and England have started discussions with DRDO to express their interest in incorporating their technology in the Aura program
 par sach to yah he ki bhartiya vayusena (jo aayiuasavi kii pramukh sanchaalak hogi) ne nishchit taur par jataa diya he ki jis platform par yah kaam karegi, us par jahaan tak ho sakavga videshi sahyog ko darkinar rakhaa jayega or khaskar samvedansheel dizin ke masale or up-pranaaliyon ke sambandh main usne nishchay kar rakhaa he ki koi videshi madad leni hi nahin he
 Behind this tough stance, the army's own apprehension is quite right that foreign government or thekkavadar can stop the necessary help after purchase in case of any differences or war
 march main raksha mantri e
 K
 antni ne sansad ko suchit kiya ki bharat kaa mushkil main fansaa adhuraa kaveri jet ingine aayiuasavi main lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Several educational institutions, including IIT, Kanpur, have been roped in to do critical research on essential components related to IUSAV
 diardio bilkul nae kshetron par kaam kar rahaa he
 If all goes as per the thinking, the specific section of the ADA, headed by senior senior aeronautical scientist Biju Uthup in Bangalore, is hopeful that the IUSAV sample will be tested by 2016
 philhal jo sthiti dikh rahi he, usamen puri duniya main viksit kiye ja rahe samaan rup se majboot 'flying wing' fauladi drone kii qatari main aayiuasavi sabase nayaa cheharaa he

 I’m sure if this movie was a lot shorter, i would have enjoyed it much more
 Instead, it drags on for too long where i found myself nodding off
 
 
 It’s another movie based on true events
 Had the movie focused more on the lead up to the Batla House incident and then the aftermath, it may have been more interesting to watch
 The scenes in the courtroom are just ridiculous and disappointing
 
 
 John Abraham was good as the main lead
 He is looking super buff; I’m pretty sure the size of his knee is the size of my thigh
 i found Mrunal Thakur's character annoying, i can't put my finger on it but, she was irritating
 Nora Fatehi has a very small role
 Her dancing skills are amazing so watch out for the # osakisaki dance number
 
 
 As far as thriller’s go, this movie has no thrills
 If you choose to watch it, make sure you have a strong cup of coffee
 
 
 2 out of 5 stars
 Remember, it's my opinion!

 ) himachal pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri prem kumaar dhumal ne daawa kiya ki unke phone tepe kiye ja rahe hai
 Dhumal has made this allegation at a time when there are allegations of phone taping during the tenure of the previous BJP government in the state, in connection with which a case has been registered by the Himachal Pradesh Police Vigilance and anti-corruption Bureau
 dhumal ne kaha, ‘bhaajapa ke anya netaaon ke phone bhi tepe kiye ja rahe hai
 Whenever i call someone or pick up the phone, a voice comes in my mobile indicating that someone is tapping my phone
 ’ unhone daawa kiya ki 2003 se 2007 main congress ke kaarykaal main bhaajapa netaaon ke phone tepe kiye gaye
 Dhumal questioned the government's move to illegally confiscate computers of the CID wing on December 24, the eve of Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh's swearing-in ceremony
 haalanki unhone saath hi kaha, ‘hamen chintaa nahin he kyonki ham saarvajanik baithkon main jo baat karte hai, phone par bhi ham vahiin baatcheet karte hai
 We have neither done anything nor said anything against the national interest
 ’purv mukhyamantri ne kaha, ‘kiske aadesh par kanoon ke khilaaf police ke siaidi wing ke computer jabt kiye or tepe kii gai baatcheet ko praapt kiya gaya
 All these things should be investigated, '' he said, adding that to bring out the truth, the government is free to conduct an inquiry into the alleged phone tapping
 dhumal ne kaha, ‘sarkaar apane mantriyon ke liye mahangi kaaren kharid rahi he lekin yah samajhnaa mushkil he ki dhan kii kami se jujh rahi sarkaar is phizulkharchi ko kaise vahan kar rahi he

 Bhansali herself told Deepika, 'your best performance so far has been yours
 tumne is kirdaar ke saath puraa nyaay kiya he
 'the special thing is that the character played by Deepika in Ramleela is' Leela' and the name is very close to Sanjay Leela Bhansali because it is her mother's name
 saaf he ki deepika ke liye yah kaaphi badi baat he
 Deepika became so emotional that she could not resist herself and wept on the sets of Ram Leela due to the compliments from Bhansali

 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar bhale hi gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kii khulkar mukhaalafat karte hon, lekin unke virodh ke baavjood unke kaaryakramon main modi ke poster chaa rahe hai or vah bhi baqayda modi ko 'aglaa pradhanmantri' bataate hue
 When the Chief Minister reached Gaya district during the Seva Yatra, Modi's poster was already pasted to welcome him
 in postaron main modi ko bhavi pradhanmantri ke rup main dikhaaya gaya he
 It is not that it is seen only during the service journey in Gaya
 isse pehle gopalganj main bhi yatra ke dauraan mukhyamantri ko isi tarah kaa najaara dekhne ko mila tha
 It is not that these posters are being put up all over the region
 nitish seva yatra ke dauraan jin margon se guzarane vaale hai, vahiin-vahiin aise poster lagaae gaye hai
 The poster reads 'namo Namo, Jan Jan Ki Awaaz and Narendra Modi's government in 2014'
 ye nitish kii seva yatra vaale poster ke najadik hi chipkaae ja rahe hai
 Significantly, Nitish's displeasure with Modi started only because of an advertisement
 bihar main ai kosi kii baadh main gujarat sarkaar kii madad ke baad ek samachar patr main nitish or modi ko ek saath dikhaane vaala vigyaapan prakashit kiya gaya tha, jiske baad nitish ne modi se duuri banani shuru kar di thi
 At that time, Nitish's resentment about this advertisement was openly exposed to everyone
 unhone gujarat sarkaar se mili madad lautaane kii baat tak kahi thi
 Once again, the poster, describing Modi as the future Prime Minister, sparked a rift between the two parties
 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke netaa bhale hi ise halke main le rahe hon, lekin janata dal-united (jediu) ke netaa ise galat maan rahe hai
 BJP state president Mangal Pandey says, 'this poster highlights the sentiments of activists towards Modi
 hamen isamen kuch galat nahin lagata
 In a democracy, everyone has the right to speak
 ' pandeya haalanki yah bhi kehete hai ki ye poster pradesh kamity yaa jila kamity dwaara nahin lagaae gaye hai
 On the other hand, a JDU leader says that these posters are being installed to provoke and harm the National Democratic Alliance (NDA)
 bijepi kaa ek dhada jediu ke khilaaf he, jo aise poster lagava rahaa he
 The leader says that the party is considering these posters but does not want to say anything now
 gauratlab he ki nitish ek may se rajya main seva yatra par nikle hai

 Mallya was produced in Westminster Court, from where he got bail
 bataa den ki vijay maalya ko bharat sarkaar ne bhagoda ghoshit kar rakhaa he
 Mallya is accused of not repaying the debt of more than 9 thousand crores from Indian banks
 isse pehle 'aaj tak' se scotland yard police ne kaha tha ki maalya ko bharat ke adhikariyon ke anurodh par giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Mallya was arrested under the indo-british treaty
 jamaanat ke baad maalya ne twit kar kaha ki bhartiya media ne badha-chadhaakar pesh kiya
 As expected, the court hearing on extradition has started from today
 maalya ne 'aaj tak' se kaha ki wo nirdosh hai
 Regarding the appearance in court, he said that he would face extradition hearing
 Usual Indian media hype
 Extradition hearing in court started today as expected

 After Mallya left the country, the opposition had attacked Modi government in a befitting manner
 sarkaar ne elaan kiya tha ki maalya ko waapas laayaa jayega
 After this, various agencies including ED and CBI were engaged in besieging Mallya
 bharat ne britain se maalya ko laane ke liye kootnithik channel kaa bhi istemaal kiya or britesh sarkaar ko chitthee bhi likhi thi
 Now after the arrest, the government will complete all the procedures and try to bring Mallya back

 After Mallya, is Lalit Modi's number now? Both of them have been in the case for the last one year, Mallya went to Britain on March 2 last year
 jabaki iske kuch din baad hi ucchtam nyaayalay ne maalya ko apane passport ke saath vyaktigat rup se 30 march, 2016 ko pesh hone ko kaha tha
 India formally requested the UK government to extradite Mallya under the indo-uk extradition treaty on February 8 this year

 Day of lovers ishk ke izhaar kaa din lekin muhabbat ke dushmano kii bhi kami nahin is duniya main
 That is why, like every time, this time also there is opposition to Valentine's Day
 haalanki police ne shanti vyavastha kaayam rakhane ke liye shriram sena ke mukhiya pramod mutalik ko ehtiyathan hiraasat main le liya he

 is baar bhi shivasena or bajrang dal kar rahe hai vailentin de kaa virodh
 Terror is also a shadow of the terrorist attack on Mumbai from above
 
 Perhaps this is why the eunuchs have sent the book of Kamasutra to Shri Ram Sena chief Pramod Muthalik, who opposes Valentine's Day
 mangaloru main shriram sena ke hamale kaa khauf vailentin de par pad rahaa he baari
 Though Shri Ram Sena chief Pramod Mutalik has bowed down and has given exemption to the youth who have fallen in love, but now the Bajrang Dal and VHP cadres have taken over the command of guarding love
 muhabbat kii amar nishaani he tajmahal lekin tajanagari main bhi lag sakati he muhabbat farmaane par pabandi
 In Agra, VHP international general secretary Pravin Togadia has clearly stated that love is right within the confines of the house of love
 bhopal main bhi he pyaar par paharaa lagane kii taiyaari
 The Bajrang Dal has clearly stated that their opposition to Valentin will continue, that means the Bajrang Dal can create trouble for the young hearts
 jaipur main to lathi ke jor par ishk par kiya jayega kaabo

 iske saath hi vahaan sarkaar banane kii sari kavayadon par brake lag gaya he
 Governor's rule was going to end on 16th of next month
 magar, isse pehle hi rajyapal ne bada faisla le liya
 Questions are arising as to which party has suffered the most from the Governor's decision
 partiyon kii tilamilaahat dekhen to teenon pramukh vipakshi partiyaan pidipi, neshnal conference (ensi) or congress ek sur main rajyapal ko kos rahi hai, lekin pidipi kii naaraazgi kuch zyada khaas he
 If anyone has suffered the most due to the dissolution of the assembly, it is the PDP
 pidipi pichhali sarkaar main thi or mahabuuba mufti mukhyamantri thim
 He had joined hands with the BJP to form the government, against which he had an old feud
 unhone kaha tha ki kashmir ko bachaane ke liye aisa karnaa padaa
 Now she joined hands with her bitter anti-national conference

 Jaitley said that consumers are not complaining about the Goods and Services Tax because the government has kept GST rates at reasonable levels
 unhone kaha, 'puure desh main kahin bhi koi upabhokta shikaayat nahin kar rahaa he kyonki hamane karon kii shreniyan taarkik banane kaa prayaas kiya he
 So why are one or two traders complaining? Traders do not have to pay taxes, the tax is paid by the consumer
 ' vittamantri ne kaha ki koi yah daawa nahin kar saktaa ki kar nahin chukaana uskaa moulik adhikaar he
 The thinking of our society was that non-payment of taxes is not a wrong thing
 is maansikta ko badalane or nayi soch paidaa karne kii zarurat he
 If India is to become a developed country from a developing country, then the thinking and attitude of the people should be like developed economies
 unhone kaha ki kisi bhi atharki sudhaar ke liye jaruri he ki sarkaar kii disha sahi ho
 No half-hearted efforts lead to reforms, if the government hesitates, it never succeeds in bringing reforms

 He said that in future one can get 12 and 18 percent rates, but today if we keep only one rate of 15 percent, then the use of the poor, on which the tax rate is kept zero, will become expensive

 kisi bhi adhakachare prayaas se sudhaar nahin hote, sarkaar hichak gayi to vah sudhaar laane main kabhi safal nahin hoti he
 He dismissed the criticism of some critics that there should be only one rate in GST
 unhone kaha ki bhavishya main 12 or 18 fisadi kii daren kisi ek mil sakati hai lekin aaj yadi ham keval ek dar 15 fisadi kii rakhte to garibon ke istemaal kii chijen, jinpar kar kii dar shunya rakhi gayi he, mahangi ho jaaengi
 The Finance Minister said that the policy of taxation should be justified
 jiesti ek july se prabhavi ho gaya he
 It has tax rates of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent and the tax rate on some essential items is zero

 com somvaar ko gurunanak jayanti ke maukey par bainkon main chuttee rahi
 In comparison, there were longer lines of cash for cash at atms than the rest of the days
 shanivaar or ravivaar ko to chuttee ke baavjood bank or post offis kholane kaa elaan hua tha, lekin somvaar ko bank karmchaariyon ko brake mila
 Due to this, there was no transaction in the exchanges and banks on Monday
 lihaaja log pareshaan hue
 However, atms also did not ease the hassle of people
 abhi tak atm se sirf 100 ke note hi nikaale ja sakate hai, kyonki zyaadaatar atm mashiinon main500 or 2000 ke nae notenheen nikal rahe hai
 The government has definitely claimed that atms will start withdrawing all kinds of notes from Tuesday, but no one knows when to get rid of long lines
 somvaar ko to logon ke paas atm hi ekmaatr sahaara the, kyonki na tobankhi khule the or na hi daakghar, jo pichley paanch dinon se note badalane ke kaam main jute hue the
 There is also an interesting fact that the long and big lines are for the exchange of notes, rather than those who deposit money in their accounts or withdraw money from the account
 aisa hone kii vajah bhi he, kyonki puraane note badalane kaa koi record unke khate main darj nahin ho rahaa he
 The ID is being taken, but it is not necessary to have the details of the back
 atm kii linemein lage pankaj kumaar ko teen baar main pehali safalataa mili
 There were definitely lines in the line twice before, but by the time their turn came, the notes were over
 yahi haal priya kaa tha, unke paas 500 or 1000 ke puraane note to paryaapt maatra main hai, lekin aise note nahin he, jo bazaar main kharch kiye ja sake
 Now the difficulty is that the only option is ATM, in which they do not know how long the line has to be

 shatrughna sinha ko bhi is baat kii bhanak he ki ho saktaa he unke bolne par sawaal uth jaae, kyonki haal tak unki chhavi modi virdohi kii rahi he

 This is the reason why Shatrughan Sinha is calling himself host and Modi as groom
 sinha ne ajtak se khaas baatcheet main kaha, 'main garajungaa ki nahin garajungaa, boluungaa ki nahin boluungaa wo zyada myne nahin rakhata
 Because i am my home state, this is my home, my area
 us din ke duulhaa narendra modi hai
 Right now, all the enthusiasm and enthusiasm is for Modi so that he will travel for Delhi with all of us, so my speaking does not matter
 'bheed ke saamne bijepi kii patna main hone vaali hunkaar raily main modi ke manch se bihari babu ke bolne par grahan laga hua he par puri koshish ho rahi he ki bihari babu ko bhi bolne kaa mauka mil jaae

 Imagine the traditional classroom of a university
 chaatr class main idhar-udhar gum rahe hai
 Some students like to sit up front, some on the back bench, and some do not come to class at all
 professor ne 45 minute ke liye vyaakhyaan diya, kuch prashn liye
 The class is postponed and students move on to the next class
 rojaanaa yahi pattern pariksha se kuch dinon yaa saptaah pehle tak doharaaya jaataa he, phir chaatr sab kuch rat jane main jute jate hai
 It is a passive learning method because students sit and receive information quietly with very little activity
 Where are the chukas taking place? Until the examinations come to the head, there is hardly any process of learning and teaching
 class main jo padhaayaa gaya use kitne chaatro ne acchhee tarah samajha? kitne logon ne kuch vaakyanshon se adhik kuch samajha vah bhi bina use aatmsaat kiye? kitne log kuch sun hi nahin rahe the? jin logon ne class main note liye, kya ve unka arth samaj rahe the yaa phir vah unke liye keval dictesan jaisaa tha? yadi hamen lagata he ki hamaare adhiktar chaatr, adhikansh samay tak hamaare lacture ko samaj lete hai to ek shikshak ke rup main ham bhram main hai
 We professors may find their lectures no matter how interesting, but it is difficult for teenagers to drown in a variety of emotions after class, after a few weeks, or after a few months
 upaay kya he?active larning main, chaatr usamen bhaag letaa he
 It engages the student's mind with itself
 jab class main chupchaap baithne ke bajaay chaatr sakriy rup se shaamil hote hai, to judaav or focus adhiktam hota he
 It is the basis of active learning; Active participation activates the mind, which in turn promotes learning
 dhyaan apane aap kendrit ho jaataa he
 We can make class attendance mandatory, but the presence of a student physically in the classroom does not mean that he or she is present mentally
 ranneetiyanrial time communication yaa tatkaal samvaad, chaatro ne jo kuch siikhaa use usee samay unke dimag main janaa chahie or spasht rup se
 In every class, all students should be called to tell them what they have learned and they can give their responses verbally
 dimag ko kendrit rakhane ke liye isse behatar kuch bhi nahin ho saktaa ki us vishay par chaatro ko bolne ko kaha jaae
 Change the way of class
 Students should tell before the class what is to be discussed so that they bring information about it and discuss it in class
 professor pehle se hi choti, focusd reeding karne ke liye kah sakate hai, or spasht kar sakate hai ki chaatro ne jo kuch bhi padhaa he use sankshep main poocha ja saktaa he
 Not just theory, its use too
 If students are only understanding the theory, they are not familiar with their use or examples in real life, then they are not really learning anything
 active larning kii kala to vah he jisamen chaatr jo kuch pehle se jaanate hai or jo nayaa sikh rahe hai, unase chaatro ko joda jaae
 You cannot ask last-minute rattles, "are examinations not a measure of what is learned and why it is important for students to continue learning throughout the semester if they can quickly absorb the material just before the exam Are you? "the answer is simple: if the learning is only in a short period just before the exam, then the faster the things are learned, the faster they go through the brain
 Yb are too
 istemaal kar len yaa phir ganvaa denaapane jo siikhaa he, agar use lagaataar doharaate nahin rahete to seekhney kaa laabh jaldi khatm ho jaataa he
 The syllabus and syllabus should be repeated regularly and use whatever is learned, it should be connected to things
 is tarah parikshaayen jo seekhney kii niskriy paddati kaa mukhya aadhaar hai, shaktishaalee active larning kaa jariya ban sakati hai, yadi unhen sirf ek yaa do baar ke bajaay semester ke dauraan aksar sanchalit kiya jaae
 Seven-minute rule requires people to have seven minutes of self-control to focus on the structure
 iske baad, ve apni aantarik maansik duniya se peeche hat jate hai
 If the professor needs to communicate with the students, it should not be in a packet longer than seven minutes

 The small drain is not able to withstand the pressure of water
 is vajah se tej barish hote hi minto road par pani bhar jaataa he
 He also told that a very old big brook was built in Paharganj
 jo dinadayal maarg par bijepi mukhyalay ke saamne se guzarati tha
 The water used to fall into the drain near ITO, but now that big drain was closed near the BJP headquarters and connected to the small drain near Kali Badi temple
 ab musiibat ye he ki kam chaudaai hone kii vajah se chota naala pani kaa pressure nahin jhel paa rahaa he or overflo ho jaataa he
 Dinesh Mohania said that the solution is only when we will connect it with a big drain on the road leading from Minto Road towards ITO

 in / a post shared by Varun Dhawan (@varundvn) on Mar 19, 2018 at 12:45am PDT The capital of the country, Delhi, has high spirits of criminals
 suraksha ko lekar police ke tamaam vaadon or intjaamon ke bich apradhibekhauf gum rahe hai or dhadlle se aparaadhik ghatnaon ko anjaam de rahe hai
 The latest case is from Delhi's Dwarka area where Rs 80 lakh was looted from a cash van in broad daylight
 badmaashon ne dwarka ilaake main dindahaade pehle to cash vine sahit driver or ganman ko kidanap kar liya gaya
 Then they were taken away from the place where they were kidnapped and they were beaten and left and looted about 80 lakh rupees
 bataa den, yah vaardaat kareeb 12:30 baje hui
 As soon as the police got the information, both the injured were admitted to a private hospital in Sector 11
 police ke mutabaki esaipiel naam kii ek privet company jo atm main cash daalati he, uski kash vine dwarka sector 1 ke ek atm main cash daalane ai thi
 Out of that, 2 people who were cashiers were going to take cash and put it in the ATM
 baaki driver or ganman sarvice road ke duusari taraf gaadi ke saath maujuud the
 When both people came out of the ATM with cash, they could not find the car
 uske baad unhone apane offis ko phone karke jaankaree di
 Meanwhile, after some time, it is learned that the van has been found in Sector 11 and the 2 employees who are Vijayakanth and Dheeraj are beaten up

 somvaar ko nai veshbhusha main najar aae rajyasabha ke marshalpurani dress main bina pagadi pahane najar aae rajyasabha ke marshalmarshall ne apni kalgi vaali safed pagadi nahin pahan rakhi thisomvaar ko rajyasabha main asana kii madad karne vaale marshall ek baar phir apni paaramparik veshbhusha main najar aae
 It is worth noting that when the winter session of Parliament started a month ago, the marshals were seen in a new dress which was largely matching the army uniform
 yahaan aapako yah bhi bataa den ki marshalon kii nai vardi par tamaam logon ko isliye hi aitraaj tha kyonki vah sena kii vardi se milti-julati thi
 For this reason, marshals stopped wearing 'p-cap' for the next few days
 lekin aaj jis dress main marshall najar aae use bhi aap puraani dress nahin kah sakate kyonki unhone apni kalgi vaali safed pagadi nahin pahan rakhi thi
 The order was given to review the uniform
 The winter session of Parliament started on 18 November
 is din asana kii sahaayta ke liye maujuud rahane vaale marshall ekadam nai veshbhusha main najar aae the
 These marshals wore a 'p-cap' and a uniform of modern security personnel, instead of a turban on the head, which was blue in color
 baharhaal unki is nai vardi par kuch raajnneetik netaaon kii tippaniyon ke baad sabhapati ne isaki samiksha ke aadesh de die the
 NID had prepared the dress, let us tell you that the new dress of marshals was prepared by the National Institute of Design (NID)
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki marshall kii dress ko antim rup dene se pehle vibhinn vidhansabhaon ke marshall ke pahanaave kii study kii gai thi
 Even in the all-party meeting held before the Parliament session, Marshall's dress was kept in front of everyone
 us vakt kisi ne bhi isaki shikaayat nahin kii thi balki iske ulat kai logon ne tarif bhi kii thi
 It is now being told that Marshall's new uniform design will be made and possibly NID will also make a new design

 Then why is there such a hurry? gauratlab he ki kendriya cabinet ne arunachal pradesh main 24 janvari ko raashtrapati shashan lagu karne kii sifarish kii thi
 It came into force the very next day
 isse pehle shatrughna sinha ke mitra or bihar ke siemanithish kumaar bhi is faisle ko galat bataa chukehain

 Kannada films are exempt from entertainment tax in Karnataka, while the government levies 30 percent entertainment tax on second language films

 In 2016, former Punjab minister Bikram Singh Majithia was accused by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of 'indulging in drug trade' and now apologized to him
 aisa kar kejariwal apni baat se mukar ke beizzat hone kii jabardast kshamta kaa pradarshan kar rahe hai
 On March 19, he expressed similar remorse and malaise for his allegations leveled against Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, Congress leader Kapil Sibal and his son Amit Sibal
 alag-alag likhit maafeenaamon main kejariwal ne 'asatyaapit' or 'bebuniyaad' aarope lagane kii baat kubul kii or jor dekar kaha ki apane bayanon se unhone jin logon kii manahani kii thi, unke khilaaf unke man main 'kuch bhi nijee' nahin tha
 But how did the leader who spewed such poison against political opponents suddenly come to such remorse? Sources in the Aam Aadmi Party say that Kejriwal wants to deal with each of the 33 defamation cases against him since 2013 out of court
 in mukademon kaa party ke vittiya sansadhano par bura asar pad rahaa he
 According to sources, on March 18, he also told some Punjab mlas at the house of Deputy CM Manish Sisodia that they do not want to get involved in court cases during the Shunchavi year
 ''sutron ne bataaya ki vitt mantri arun jetali, dilli kii purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit or bhaajapa netaa ramesh vidhudi—inhone bhi kejariwal ke khilaaf manahani ke mukademe daayar kar rakhe hai—ke saath jaldi hi aise hi sulah-samjhauton kii sambhaavna he
 He has also apologized to Jaitley but Jaitley, refusing to forgive him, has asked to take the case to the end
 apane khilaaf mukademon ke nibatare kii kejariwal kii koshishon ne, khaskar majithia ko di gai unki 'clin chit' ne, aap ke bheetar baari sankat paidaa kar diya
 The party's Punjab unit collapsed and 14 of its 20 mlas started pushing for 'distance from Delhi'
 unamem se kai to 'nai kshetreey party' laanch karnaa chaahate hai
 Many analysts say that the manner in which Kejriwal created 'majithia for complicity in drug trade' by taking his name separately, he helped create resentment among voters against the Gaddinshin akali-bjp coalition government at that time

 In which the cleaning workers can be promised to get salary on 7th of every month, health insurance and safety kit used during garbage cleaning
 gauratlab he ki aam aadmi party prachaar ke aakhri ek hafte ko kaaphi ahm maan rahi he
 This is the reason that Arvind Kejriwal is going to focus on big issues like cleanliness, corruption, electricity-water rate, house tax waiver and MCD scam in his public meeting

 His voice was steady, suppressed, extinguished but his face was shouting

 In this four-minute address, Obama wiped tears seven times and said three times that my heart is broken today

 This was not a terrorist incident
 ye koi naslavali hinsa bhi nahin thi
 It was the craziness of a freak, who suddenly became a devil from a human being, who rushed to the school of innocent people with the goods of death, fired indiscriminately and shot himself as well
 sawaal sabase bada ye he ki aakhir ek aisa samaaj jo sabase sabhy hone kaa dam bharta he, jahaan kaa samaaj apane logon ko sabase zyada maukey dene kaa daawa karata he
 Why is this kind of madness coming again and again? kabhi skool main goli baari, kabhi mal main firing to kabhi gurudware main katleam
 After the death of 7 people in the Gurdwara firing, President Obama probably said the truth that this is a time of introspection for America

 Tunnel technology from BSF Israel is coming soon to prevent infiltration from Pakistan through the tunnel
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik isroyal army kii technical team BSF ke adhikariyon se 30 oktober ko mulaakaat karne vaali he
 In this meeting, how will Israel stop Palestinian intruders using tunnel technology on the border of Palestine, that technology will be discussed with BSF officials

 Before this, let us tell you that BSF has talked to Israel for many other technologies i
e
 smart fencing to stop terrorist infiltration at the International Border
 aapako bataa den ki haal hi main jammu evam kashmir main 30 sitambar ko antarrashtriya seemaa ke paas pakistan kii taraf se khodi gai ek 14 foot lambii surang mili he
 This tunnel was found at such a time
 jab ek din pehle hi biguef ke field cmanderon or pakistani rangers ke bich ek flag meeting hui thi, jisamen aapas main sahmati bani thi ki donon paksh antarrashtriya seemaa par shanti or sauhaard banaae rakhenge
 Despite this, Pakistan did not desist from its tricks and has been using different methods to infiltrate
 surang banane ke liye pakistan isse pehle bhi koshish kar chukaa he or is tareeke kii surang banaakar ghuspaith karne kaa prayaas bhi pakistan karata rahaa he
 According to the information, this is the second tunnel found in the last seven months on the india-pakistan border
 isse pehle samba ke ramgarh sector main surang mili thim
 The BSF estimates that these tunnels are also linked to increased ceasefire violations by Pakistan in recent times
 biguef ab pakistan kii taraf se ghuspaith karne ke liye surang istemaal or usase nipatane kii har ek kaat ko aajmaana chaah rahi he
 In this connection, BSF can use that technology on the international border in the coming time by using information from Israel's tunnel technology
 biguef sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik isse pehle biguef surang ke jariye ghuspaith ko rokane ke liye bharat main maujuud tunnel technology kii testing biguef academy tetanpur main kar chuki he
 Now some new technology will speed up the campaign to completely stop infiltration from Israel through the tunnel

 hansal mehta kii nirdeshit film 'omerta' ko sensor board ne a certificate diya he
 The movie is based on the life of terrorist Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh
 pehle film 20 april ko relies hone vaali thi lekin ab 4 may ko hogi
 The reason behind postponing the film was not to get the green signal from the censor board
 diarector hansal mehta 'omerta' main chhedchhad nahin kiye jane ko lekar sensor board se jujhane ke liye taiyaar the
 In an interview, he said that he will not allow even 1 cut in the film
 unka kahana tha ki film ke sabhi seens kaaphi ahm hai or unhen hataanaa kahani ke saath ninsaphi hogi
 Hansal Mehta said on Omerta on terrorism- i want to show the truth, however, only 1 important cut has been ordered in the film
 yah us seen main he jab shaikh (rajkumaar raav) jail main peshaab kar rahaa hota he or us dauraan baahar bharat kaa raashtragan baj rahaa he
 The censor board has asked the scene to remove the national anthem
 film 'omerta' ke nirmaataa phurkan khan ne kaha, hamen film ke is drishy se raashtragan ko hataane ke liye kaha gaya he or isaki jagah bankground gaanaa rakhane ke liye kaha he
 We happily followed it and the film received an a certificate, which the film deserves
 Omerta Poster: kariyar ke sabase mushkil kirdaar main rajkumaar razeb 'omerta' kaa klesh amitabh bachchan-rishi kapur kii kamedi film '102 note out' se hoga
 Let me tell you, earlier pair of Hansal Mehta and Rajkumar Rao have worked together
 donon kii saath main ye chauthi film he
 Both have previously worked in the film City Lights, Shahid and Aligarh
 aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ke liye samaajawaadee party kii suchi main uttar pradesh sarkaar ke chaar mantriyon surendra singh patel, shahid manjuur, balram yadav or omprakash singh or vidhansabha adhyaksh mata prasad pandeya kaa naam aane ke baad party kii siyasat ko alag hi chashme se dekha ja rahaa he
 It is believed that by giving tickets to these veterans, the party has run a double wager
 agar ye netaa jeet gaye to aage se ye centre kii raajnneeti main aa jaaenge or mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko inaki varishthata kaa adab karne kii jhanjhat se chhutkaaraa mil jayega
 And if some of these wickets fell in the Lok Sabha elections, then their stature will be reduced automatically
 in netaaon ne jis utsaah or vinamrata se party kaa tikat shirodharya kiya, usase lagata he ki sapa kii yah ranneeti kaaphi had tak kaamyaab rahi he
 "I am contesting with all my heart," says Shahid Manzoor, a minister from Meerut Lok Sabha constituency and MLA from Kithore (meerut)
 rashtriya raajnneeti main aana mere liye fakhr kii baat he
 To say that an election is being conducted to remove someone from here is utterly baseless
 ” lekin kaddavar mantri ajam khan par party ab tak yah daanv nahin chal pai he
 Despite all the courtesy, the uneasy relationship between Azam Khan and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav is not hidden from anyone
 rampur kaa tikat ghoshit hone main deree kyon? party ke rashtriya pravaktaa rajendra choudhary spasht karte hai, ‘‘rampur samet sabhi siton par pratyaashiyon kaa elaan disambar ke ant tak kar diya jayega
 Can Azam Khan also be removed from Rampur? "see, if you want Azam Saheb from there, you can contest the elections yourself or fight whomever you want
 rampur kaa faisla to unhen hi karnaa he
 Was Chaudhary's answer
 lekin khan philhal uttar pradesh se hatane ke mood main dikhte nahin
 Will he contest the Lok Sabha elections on Netaji's suggestion? His answer was spot on by the heat, "netaji would not say that
 doosraa ye ki meraa shahar behad garib he
 The Nawabs have looted it so much that i will be able to work for it only by staying in Uttar Pradesh
 mujhe loksabhaa chunaav main dilchaspee nahin he
 "there are two or three names in the mind of this powerful Muslim leader of the party
" ‘‘abhi chunaav main lanbaa samay he
 There are two-three names in my mind

 As far as Jai Prada is concerned, if she comes to the party, then she will come before him (hint) towards Amar Singh
 or unke ‘wo’ ko party bardaasht nahin kar paaegi

 ab party ko tay karnaa he ki vah unke saath nae sameekaran kaise banaati he
 Film: aurangzebdirector: Atul Sabharwal Artist: Arjun Kapoor, Sasha Aga, Rishi Kapoor, Jackie Shroff, Amrita Singh and Prithvirajbajat: Rs 25 crore
 arjuna kapur ne ishakajade ke apane andaaj ko hi aurangzeb main aage badhaayaa he
 Perhaps he is the only actor of the younger generation who believes in doing something solid by not tying himself to the character of Chocolate boy
 unki taaja film aurangzeb isi or ishaara karti he
 This film of Arjun is the first in many ways, such as an actor is seen in a double role on the screen after a long time
 rishi kapur police vaale bane hai or gudgaanv ke real estate mafia ko lekar koi kahani saamne ai he
 Of course, the film moves forward in a tremendous way, but as usual the film goes into its second stage and weakens some
 bollywood ke diarectaron ko apni film ko lambey samay tak box of offis par daudane ke liye behatar and or second half kaa eendhan chahie hoga
 At a time when comedy and light-hearted movies are coming, Aurangzeb raises a different kind of hope
 kahani main kitna damafilm gudgaanv ke do pariwaron kii hai
 Yashvardhan (jackie Shroff) is a real estate player and is engaged in illegal activities
 police yashvardhan tak pahunchane ke liye uske bete ajay (arjuna kapur) ko nishaanaa banaati he or uske hamshakl vishaal ko uski jagah bhej detii he
 On one side is the family of Jackie Shroff and on the other side there is the police family of Ravikant (rishi Kapoor)
 puraa drama isi ke chaaron ore buna hua he
 The story moves with speed
 lekin first half ke baad kahani kaa taana-bana diarector ke haathon se nikalataa najar aata he
 The end also tightens slightly
 kahani kahin-kahin uljhi hui bhi lagati he
 Dialogues are good, but due to being devoted to salim-javed, they sometimes seem to get stuck
 research acchhee he, lekin treetment thodaa kamjor
 Star Appeal Arjun Kapoor is in the limelight
 unhen dekhakar lagata hi nahin he ki yah unki duusari film he
 It is worth it to roll a new star like this
 rishi kapur to badhati umr ke saath kamaal hote ja rahe hai
 Rauf Lala in Agneepath, a 50-year Bachelor in Chashmebadur and now a police officer, is tremendous
 prithviraj ko sarprise package kaha ja saktaa he
 Sasha Agha's job is to add glamor to the film
 iske alaava film main gujarey jamaane ke kai sitare jaise jaiki shroff, amrutha singh or dipti naval ne bhi acha kaam kiya he
 But the trio of arjuna-rishi-prithviraj is amazing
 kissa kamai kafilm medium bajet he
 The publicity of the film is done in such a way that there is a lot of craze in the audience about it
 lekin hindi filmon ke saath pesh aane vaali samasya iske saath bhi he
 Second half spoils the flavors
 kul milakar aurangzeb ek baar jarur dekhne laayak thriller he kyonki nae daur main arjuna jaise sitare bahut kam hai jo risk lekar chalate hai
 Overall the film is average

 pashcham bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee par barasate hue bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne aaj un par vot bank kii raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Modi said that during the reign of the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal there has been no real change
 bijepi netaa ne yahaan ek chunavi raily main kaha ki jab bengal main sarkaar badali thi, tab maine sochaa tha ki vahaan vikaas hoga
 but nothing happened
 vah log sirf vot bank kii raajnneeti main lipt hai
 Attacking Mamata, Modi said that unless she criticized Modi, her food was not digested
 apni zyaadaatar reliyon main mamata ne modi kii aalochana karte hue unhen kathith taur par sampradayik qaraar diya he or gujarat dangon ke liye unhen jimmedaar bataaya he
 Modi's speech is in contrast to his earlier speech in Kolkata in February, when he took a soft stance towards Mamata and even asked people to bring Didi in Bengal and BJP in Delhi
 unhone kaha ki nai sarkaar ko satta sanbhale hue do varsh ho gaye hai, lekin kya aapane koi parivartan dekha he? logon ke saath dhokhaa kiya gaya he
 If you have a strong and progressive government in Delhi, then every little thing will be organized

 He said that Chief Minister, the more mud you throw, the more lotus will blossom
 modi ne kai karod rupee ke sharada chitfund ghotaale ke maamle par bhi party kii ninda kii or kaha ki unhen sajaa milani chahie
 In indirect reference to the allegation of involvement of some Trinamool Congress leaders in the scam, he said that those who have indulged in loot in such a short time, what will they do if they get more time and opportunity? jammu kashmir main aatankiyon kii qamar todane ke liye bhartiya army lagaataar ection main he
 It has been said from the army that about 115 terrorists are still active in the valley
 adhiktar aatanki dakshin kashmir main he
 Army officer BS Raju said in his statement on Friday that out of these 115 terrorists, 99 are local terrorists and 15 are foreign terrorists
 unhone ye bhi bataaya ki sena ne pichley 6 maheene main lagbhag 80 aatankiyon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya he
 Let us tell you that the Indian Army had launched 'operation Allout' to wipe out the terrorists in the valley some time back

 After the appointment of Dineshwar Sharma, Army Chief Bipin Rawat said that his appointment will not affect the operation of the army
 ham apana kaam jari rakhenge
 Significantly, despite the operation of the army, the terrorists are not getting out of their antics
 aatanki lagaataar sena ke campon yaa phir aam janon par hamalaa karte hai
 Now the Army has also set some targets in its Operation Allout Key
 sena ke nishane par ab jakir musa, (al kaayda), riyaj niku, (hijbul mujahiddeen), saddaam pader, (hijbul mujahiddeen), jinat ul islam (lashkar) or khalid (jaish-e-mohammad) hai
 What was 'operation Allout'? It is noteworthy that the Army has prepared 'operation All Out' before this to eliminate terror from the valley
 isamen surakshabalon ne kashmir main maujuud 258 aatankiyon kii list taiyaar kii thi
 Many of them have been killed in terrorist encounters
 is list main lashkar, hijbul mujahidin or al badr jaise sanghathanon se jude aatanki hai

 Kuldeep Bishnoi of HJC is the son of late Bhajanlal, inld's Ajay Chautala is the son of former Chief Minister Omprakash Chautala, and Congress's Jayaprakash has been a three-time MP
 is chunaav main bishnoi ko bhaajapa kaa samarthan he
 The seat fell vacant in June after the demise of Bhajan Lal
 bhajanlaal haryana ke teen baar mukhyamantri rahe or raajnneetik dalbadal ke liye badnaam rahe
 He won this seat in May 2009
 hisar seat ke liye 13 oktober ko matdaan hoga, or chunaav parinaam 17 oktober ko ghoshit kiya jayega
 Chief Minister Hooda has been camping in Hisar for about 15 days as the HJC-BJP alliance and INLD are in the fray for the powerful candidates so that the seat is occupied by the Congress
 anna ke ek pramukh sahyogi arvind kejariwal ne yahaan kaha, "mukhyamantri yahaan lagbhag 15 dinon se deraa daale hue hai
 Even his sons are frozen in Hisar
 congress netaa kah rahe hai ki sonia gandhi kii pratishtha daanv par he
 "kejriwal said," We have not asked anyone to vote for BJP or any other party or candidate
 ham keval yah kah rahe hai ki congress ko vot na den, kyonki is party ne prabhavi jan lokapal vidheyak ko laane kaa virodh kiya he or yah bhrasht logon ko bachaana chaahati he
 Hisar voters can choose any remaining candidate
 " hooda is sachai ke baavjood ki hisar upachunaav kaa parinaam kisi or kii jholii main ja saktaa he, vah lagaataar gaanvon va kasbon kaa daura kar rahe hai or apni puri takat laga rahe hai
 The support of Trinamool Congress to UPA candidate Pranab Mukherjee in the presidential election could fetch him around seven lakh votes, leaving his rival PA Sangma far behind and it seems that there will be a one-sided contest
 jin partiyon ne mukherjee kaa samarthan kiya he unke mat kaa mulya kareeb saat lakh he jabaki sangama ke teen lakh 15 hajaar mat mulya hai jabaki nirvachan mandal main 10,98,882 mat mulya hai
 If all votes are cast, the winner will need 5,49,422 votes
 vipakshi sangama maton ke guna bhaag main kaaphi peeche hai jabaki bhaajapa unka samarthan kar rahi he
 former Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee include many parties like Samajwadi Party, BSP, CPI (M), Janata Dal (U), Shiv Sena etc
