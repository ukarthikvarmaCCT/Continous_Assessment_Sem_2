 a BJP leader associated with this process claims that Modi "moved away from what he himself thought was better and asked his team to prepare a suitable and practical blueprint"
 ” is tarah, bharat ko ‘mahangaai or dhimi pragati ke makadzaal se nikaalane kaa vyapak aarthik darshan taiyaar hua
 The blueprint of this economic outlook had started taking shape long before

 An industrialist who met him in December says, "they wanted very accurate advice that would create employment and increase investment
" ve yojana ayog jaise thass or naakaam ho chuke vichaar nahin chaahate the
 "he recalls that in the meeting someone told Modi that the idea of building 100 modern cities is not practical
 ve tapaak se bole, “malaysia, china or thailand kar sakate hai to ham kyon nahin?”aarthik nitiyon ko aakaar dene kaa kaam jari he kyonki bijepi tex sudhaaron or pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadi) par ranneeti abhi taiyaar hi kar rahi he
 The party is supportive of foreign investment in defense and infrastructure, but it has apprehensions about foreign investment in the retail market
 bijepi shasit rajasthan ne 1 farvari ko khudara bazaar main pratyaksh videshi nivesh ko khaarij kar diya
 Modi, who has attracted industry houses in his state Gujarat, is also along the party line in terms of FDI in retail trade
 unka bhi maananaa he ki isse chote dukandaaron ko nuksaan hoga
 His economic philosophy advocates minimal government intervention in industry and trade

 At the Delhi meeting, Modi said, "good governance needs to be emphasized for growth in India
 ”unke mutabik sushasan ke teen stambh hai—nitiyon main spashtataa, nirnay prakriya main paardarshita or amal main teji
 Modi wants to implement the Gujarat model at the national level which has made his image of Vikas Purush
 iske centre main gaanv chhod rahe lakhon logon ke rojgaar ke liye shahari infrastracchar kaa vikaas karnaa he
 BJP treasurer Piyush Goyal, who helped Modi develop an economic philosophy, says, "our cities are overburdened, their infrastructure cannot withstand any more pressure
" ” goyal kehete hai ki 100 nae smart shahar judwa shahar honge yaa un dur-daraaj ke ilaakon main honge jahaan infrastracchar to nahin he par logon main kaushal he, gudgaanv yaa navi mumbai kii tarah nahin
 It is easy to make such a plan on paper, but it is difficult to land it because its price is heavy
 na modi, na goyal iske aankadon ke vistaar main jate hai
 But guess from this example
 korea main 80 varg kilometre tech siti kii yojana 264 arab dollar kii he

 Is close to yah prastaav party ke varisht netaaon ko nahin bhaayaa
 The second issue is about inflation
 bijepi kaa maananaa he ki mahangaai par maal aapurti ko sanchalit karke kaabo main kiya ja saktaa he, na ki arabiai ke mudra aapurti par ankush lagaakar maang ko rokane jaise praavdhaanon se
 Modi's plan is to make a system of "correcting the agricultural yield data in due course so that a proper decision of import or export can be made
" ” goyal ke mutabik yah tarika pehle bhi kaam aa chukaa he
 He says, "when Vajpayee came to power in 1998, inflation was in double digits
 chah varsh main in muddon par tavajjo di gai to 2004 main jab bijepi satta se hati to mahangaai 3-4 pratishat par aa gai thi
 “to make this possible, India needs to attract large amounts of foreign capital

 lekin jaise kisi mithai main sirf dabaakar dryfruits daal dene bhar se use swaadisht nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 In the same way, to make a film houseful only with a huge starcast, forceful action and comedy does not mean that it will also do movie entertainment
 khayr, aaie jaanate hai housephul 4 logon ko hansaane main kitni safal hui he
 What the story of the film? The story of the film starts from London but stops 10–5 minutes in London and reaches Sitamgarh soon
 to landan kaa porshan film ke first half main hi dimag se gaayab ho jaataa he
 Well, let's get to the story
 film kii kahani punarjanm par aadhaarit he
 The first half of the film shows the story of 1419 and the second half of 2019
 1419 kii kahani par aae to madhavgarh ke rajkumaar bala (akshay kumaar) ko unke pita ne rajya se bedakhal kar diya he
 Bala is a very cruel and mean prince
 jiske baad wo apane pita se badla lene ke liye sitamgarh jaakar vahaan kii badi rajkumaari madhu (kriti senon) se shaadi kar puraa rajya hathiyanna chahta he
 So that he can later take revenge on his father by attacking him
 jab rajkumaar bala sitamgarh jaataa he to us vakt sitamgarh ke maharaj (ranjit) ke janmdin ke uplakshya main 5 din kaa jashn chal rahaa hota he
 Upon reaching Sitamgarh, Bala tries to trap Princess Madhu in the trap of his love
 isi dauraan bala kii mulaakaat bangadu maharaj (ritesh deshmukh) se hoti he jo ki ek nritki he
 Together with Bangaroo Maharaj, find a way to find Madhu
 jiske baad entry hoti he rajkumariyon ke angrakshak dharmaputra (bobi deol) kii
 Bala also associates Dharmaputra with the princess to trap Madhu and later also captures Princess Madhu with her tricks
 isi bich dharmaputra or bangadu maharaj bhi donon rajkumariyon se pyaar karne lagate hai
 Everybody wants to get married
 lekin unki shaadi ho nahin paati he
 The reason behind their not getting married is Gama (rana Daggubati)
 lekin gamma sabhi rajkumariyon kii shaadi kyon nahin hone detaa? is puri kahani main suryabhaan (sharad kelkar) kaa kya role he? 1419 kii is kahani kaa 2109 main kaise asar dikhegaa? akshay kumaar, ritesh deshmukh or bobi deol kii jindagi main kitne utaar-chadhaav aaenge? or jo milan 1419 main nahin hua wo 2019 main hoga? ye sab jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 The weakest link in the script / directionfilm is the storyline, while the strongest is the direction
 housephul kii script kamedi film ko dhyaan main rakhkar to bilkul nahin banaai gai he
 There are only 4 to 5 scenes in the entire film where laughter comes
 varna to lagata he ki koi ganda joke markar jabardastee hansaane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 The story does not connect anywhere
 imoshan hi nahin aa paata he
 In between, one feels boredom
 first half main to itnaa ection he ki bhul hi jate hai ki kamedi film dekhne aae hai
 The film has been strayed from the film's main point comedy by putting forceful action
 film ke grand sets ko dekhakar lagata he ki housephul nahin bahubali dekhne aae hai
 There has been an attempt to add a spunk of horror in the film as well, but to no avail
 vahiin duusare half main khaastaur par climax main hansaane kii thik-thaak koshish kii he
 Laughter ensues when the knives are inserted into the bomb of Akshay Kumar one after the other
 vahiin agar diarection kii baat karen to farhaad saamaji ne shandaar kaam kiya he
 Camera angles are also good
 wide range main shoot kiya gaya he
 Boring jokes have been used in the film named dialoguedialogue
 lekin johny liver or chanki pandey ne naav ko doobane se bachaane kii puri koshish kii he
 Comic timing of both is as good as ever
 sari pahanakar johny liver kaa dance bhi anterten karata he
 Talking of acting, akshay-ritesh-bobby has done justice to their respective roles
 agar film ke dialog achche or panchi hote to har kairactor or nikharkar aata
 That masala was missing from Housefull, on which the film was made
 vahiin kriti senon-kriti kharbanda or puja hegade kii acting utana feel nahin de pai
 Talking about Nawazuddin Siddiqui, if his role in the film is only about songs
 agar navazuddin kii jagah koi or wo role karata to bhi chalata
 Sharad Kelkar has played his role well
 rana daggubati bhi phul on kairactor main rahe
 Rana was perfect in the role of the dreaded villain
 graphics / cinemetographygraphics or cinemetography kaa film main bakhubi istemaal kiya gaya he
 The graphics used to establish every character at the beginning of the film are also fantastic
 film ke graphics or set bahubali kii yaad dilaate hai
 There is no need to tell the music, but still the best thing in the film is its music
 film kaa becoground mujeec khud hi aadhi kahani kah de detaa he
 Bala, Ek Chumma, The Bhoot Song and Chammo all do full on entertainment

 desh main chunavi sargarmi behad tej he
 Every party is manipulating how to increase its strength in Parliament
 ham sabhi jaanate hai ki desh main satta kaa rasta hameshaa uttar pradesh se hokar se jaataa he
 While the BJP is busy with its peers to save power, the two opposite Dhruv SP and BSP of the state came together to oust the BJP from power
 buaa-babua ke is gathjod ne bijepi samarthakon kii niden uda di kyonki tamaam survey bataate hai ki agar bijepi ko satta main aane se koi roak saktaa he to wo he samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party kaa gathbandhan
 This alliance is also in direct competition with BJP
 lekin 2014 chunaav ke nateezon main kuch chaunkaane vaale aankade hai
 If this voting pattern is accepted, then there are only 35 such seats where both parties are in a position to stop the BJP together
 ham aisa isliye kah rahe hai kyonki upi kii kul 80 siton main se 62 siton par sapa or basapa duusare or tisare paaydaan par aaye the or inkaa kul mat pratishat jodne par ye aankada saamne aata he
 These figures show that even after adding the vote percentage of both the parties, the Samajwadi Party and BSP are in a position to contest the BJP in only 35 seats, i
e
 27 of these 62 seats are where SP and BSP votes together Even if they are not in a position to defeat the BJP
 agar 2014 ke aankadon ko aadhaar maane to akhilesh yadav or mayawati kaa gathbandhan bijepi se aaj kii taarikh main 35 siten chin saktaa he
 If 5 SP seats won are added to this, then this figure reaches 40 i
e
 SP BSP alliance can win 40 out of 80 seats as on date
 is gathbandhan kii haalat bulandshahr, mujffarpur, agra, hathras or faijabad jaisi siton par behad kharaab he
 Here the difference of bjp's victory is more than the difference of combined votes of both
 vahi sapa basapa gathbandhan ko phayda basti, sanbhal, hardoi, nagina, lalganj or gajipur jaisi siton par ho saktaa he jahaan donon partiyon ke sanyukt voton or bijepi ke vot pratishat main kareeb 20 fisadi kaa antar he yani in siton par bijepi ke liye badha khatra mandara rahaa he
 By not joining the Congress in the coalition, the SP and the BSP have divided 75 seats among themselves
 saath hi gathbandhan ne philhal ye faisla kiya he ki wo congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii seat amethi or upie kii cheirperson sonia gandhi kii raibareli seat par ummidavaar khadaa nahin karenge
 Let us tell you that in 2014, the BSP could not win a single seat while in 34 seats it was at number 2
 vahiin samaajawaadee party 31 siton par or congress 7 siton par duusare paaydaan par pahunchi thi
 These figures of UP for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections are interesting, the SP BSP alliance has increased the difficulties of the BJP but it will not be easy to defeat the BJP, yet the biggest challenge of the BJP will be to stop these two parties, then for both Samajwadi Party and BSP the most
 The big challenge would be to transfer their votes to each other

 Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Padmavati is in controversy
 bahut kam logon ko is baat kii jaankaree he ki sanjay lila bhansaali ye film kareeb 18 saal pehle se bananaa chaahate the
 For this, he had also finalized the star cast, although that could not happen then
 kuch vajahon se ye film thande baste main chali gai
 In fact, Bhansali had the story of bajirao-mastani and 'padmavati' in mind since he made 'hum Dil De Chuke Sanam' in 1999 with Salman Khan, Ajay Devgan and Aishwarya Rai
 film main salmaan-aish kii jodi lene ke peeche unki on or ofscreen chemistry thi
 Deepika's Padmavati can never be flopped, will charge such amount
 Bhansali wants to make money aishwarya-salman couple Bhansali wanted to make Bajirao Mastani and Padmavati with this pair
 sutron kii maane to bhansaali kii koshish thi ki ham dil de chuke sanam kii jaadu ko ek baar phir silver screen par ricriet kiya jaae
 However, this could not happen
 jaankaree ke mutabiq aishwarya raay ko rani padmavati kaa role karnaa tha jabaki salmaan khan ko allaudin khilji kaa role diya ja rahaa tha
 Later Salman and Ash have a breakup
 donon ke rishte bhi aise nahin rahe ki wo ek saath filmein karen
 Although Bhansali approached her 'padmavati' even after the breakup, the matter did not work out
 haalanki aishwarya, padmavati ke role ke liye raji thim or chaahati thim ki allaudin kaa role salmaan khan hi karen
 Actually, Ash was trying not to share the screen with Salman after the breakup
 lekin bhansaali kii yojana par pani phir gaya
 Salman did not agree to the role of Alauddin Khilji
 manamafik star cast na milane kii vajah se bhansaali ne apana project thande baste main daal diya
 Why Bhansali made Padmavati after 18 years? Actually, after making a block buster film like 'goliyon Ki Rasleela Ramleela' with Deepika and Ranveer Singh, Bhansali created the historical story Bajirao Mastani in 2015 about the pair
 box offis par donon kii jodi ne kamaal kiya
 After 18 years with the historical formula being a hit, Bhansali got the desired star cast for Padmavati
 unhone film banane kaa faisla kiya
 However, with the announcement of Padmavati, he also started frequent disputes
 padmavati par bavaal jari, bhansaali ke daftar ke baahar 24 ghante police kaa pahraisambar main relies hogi filmapadmavati 1 disambar ko cinemagharon main relies hogi
 Now Ranveer Singh is playing the Salman Khan role
 jabaki rani padmavati ke kirdaar main deepika padukon najar aane vaali hai
 Shahid Kapoor plays Raja Ratan Singh
 film kaa kul bajet 180 karod rupee he
 Delhi has more than 3500 private schools, 1150 government schools and more than 2500 schools run by local bodies
 jab se bispi saansad dhananjay singh or unki patni jagriti singh ko naukaraani kii hatya ke aarope main giraftaar kiya gaya he tab se kuch naa kuch khulaase ho rahe hai
 Now during the investigation of this murder case, the police has come to know that Dr
 Jagriti Singh used to watch the minor on CCTV while taking a bath
 ye aarope lagaaya he duusari naukaraani minaa ne
 Meena is currently admitted to RML Hospital and has given this statement to the Magistrate
 saath hi usne apane upar hui julm kii dastaan bhi police ko bataai
 Dhananjay also used to kill the servants of copulis, if up's Bahubali MP Dhananjay Singh used to beat a minor servant
 ye baat khud naaballig ne police ko bataai he
 Investigation has revealed that Dhananjay's wife Jagriti Singh did not like the fact that there were more people in the house at all times
 saath hi jagriti ye bhi chaahati thim ki ghar main kisi bhi tarah ke anti soshal element kii entry naa ho kyonki ab dhananjay or jagriti kaa betaa bada ho rahaa tha
 When these demands of awakening were not met, she gradually lost her temper and no one knew when she became so angry
 police jod sakati hai or dharaempulice ab is behad hiprophile or sansanikhej maamle main kuch or dharaaen jodne par vichaar kar rahi he
 Police believe that the case falls under POSCO law and criminal conspiracy based on the way Dhananjay Singh tampered with the evidence and the statement made by Maid Meena
 police ne us agency se bhi sampark kiya he, jiske madhyam se ye naukar saansad ke ghar par kaam karne aae the
 Meanwhile, the RML Hospital (where Jagriti Singh used to work) has also sought a report from the police about what clauses have been imposed against Jagriti
 ummid he ki guuruuvaar ko raakhi kaa postmortem ho jayega
 The police have so far CCTV footage and statements made before the magistrates of both the servants, which it considers to be strong evidence
 dhananjay or unki patni jagriti paanch dinon ke liye police ke paas hai
 Obviously, the police will try to gather more and more evidence against them during this period

 As a result, the BJP failed to prove a majority in the House, due to which BS Yeddyurappa had to resign

 yoga diwas par yun to dilli hi nahin desh or duniya main har jagah lago yoga kii tamaam mudraaen karte najar aae, lekin netaa agar celibrity ho to use har jagah yoga karnaa hota he
 The same applies to Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari

 It is worth noting that in Delhi today, many programs were held in different places in view of Yoga Day
 bijepi netritv ne bhi apane sabhi netaaon, parshadon or alag-alag padaadhikariyon ko yoga ke aayojan karne ke nirdesh die the
 In such a situation, Manoj Tiwari also had to attend many such programs

 That is why he was the most in demand for Yoga Day events

 In such a situation, he had many invitations
 unke liye sabase mushkil yab baat rahi ki unhen yoga ke saath-saath geet bhi gane pade
 He took part in ndmc's Talkatora Garden Yoga program in the morning
 unhone vahaan aae logon ke saath yogasana kiye or deshbhakti ke geet bhi gaae

 Several parties are contesting for the post, ranging from the government's ally Shiv Sena to opposition parties like YSRCP and BJD
 aamtaur par yah pad kisi vipakshi party ko dene kii parampara rahi he or isi kaa paalan karte hue pichhali baar AIADMK ko yah pad diya gaya tha
 According to sources, Mohan Reddy's party has been offered the position of deputy speaker but YSRCP has placed a condition before taking this post
 party kaa kahana he ki vah dipti spikar kaa pad lekar sarkaar ke saath khadey dikhnaa nahin chaahate hai
 Jagan's party has made it clear that he will not stand with the ruling party until Andhra Pradesh is accorded special state status
 haalanki party ne vipakshi dalon se bhi baraabar kii duuri banane kii baat kahi he
 Special state fight: Demand for special state status to Andhra Pradesh has become a problem for the Modi government
 isi vajah se pichhali sarkaar se andhra kii party tidipi satta se baahar ho gai thi
 Many sessions of the 16th Lok Sabha had become an uproar due to this demand
 ab agar wiesarsi is maang par adi rahi to phir se sansad main hangaamaa hona tay he
 On the other hand, in the big opposition parties, one BJD is also eyeing the post of deputy speaker but BJP hardly considers Naveen Patnaik's party to be worth it
 bhale hi naveen patnayak kii party bijedy centre sarkaar ke faislon kaa saath khadi najar aa rahi ho lekin rajya main bijepi-bijedy ke hiton kaa takaraav he
 BJP is busy spreading its foot in the state and BJD has to save its fort there
 aise main odisha kii is party ko dilli main bijepi apane saath khadaa karke khatra mol nahin lenaa chaahegi
 On the other hand, the Shiv Sena, which has been included in the NDA, has also agreed to the post of deputy speaker but giving the second big post to the ruling party after the election of the speaker from the ruling party may go against the tradition
 pichhali baar duusare sabase bade dal congress ko darkinar kar modi sarkaar ne tisare number kii party AIADMK ke em
 Thambidurai was made deputy speaker, the decision of which was also questioned
 kya he shivasena kii maangashivasena netaa sanjay raut ne kaha tha ki dipti spikar kaa pad koi maang nahin he, balki gathbandhan main doosraa bada dal hone ke naate unka adhikaar he
 18 Shiv Sena mps have won this time
 aise main agar bijepi uske dipti spikar ke pad kii maang ko maan leti he to shivasena se saansad vinayak raaoot ke naam par muhar lag sakati he
 Vinayak Raut, MP from ratnagiri-sindhudurg Lok Sabha seat in Maharashtra, is counted among the veteran Shiv Sena leaders
 america videsh mantri hillari clinton ne pakistan par ek baar phir aatankwaadiyon ke panaahagaah ke khilaaf karrwai karne ke liye dabaav daalaa

 # bajiraomastani 🎬 | # deepikapadukone # deepika # ranveer # ranveersingh # deepveera post shared bybollywood 🍁(@bollymausam) onnov 13, 2018 at 7:53am pstriporta ke mutabik is maukey par deepika or ranvir kaaphi khubasurat najar aae
 It is reported that when both changed rings on the occasion of engagement, Deepika became emotional
 unke ankhen nam ho gai or yah najaara dekh kar vahaan maujuud sabhi mehmaan bhi imotional ho gaye
 The two are married to 2 different customs as Ranveer is Sindhi and Deepika Konkani
 ranvir or deepika sanjay lila bhansaali kii film goliyon kii raasalila - ramlila main ek duusare ke kareeb aae the
 It was during the shooting of this film that the friendship of the two moved up a notch
 donon ne ek duusare se lagaataar milanaa julna shuru kar diya
 For a long time both of them kept hiding this relationship from the media, but after a time both of them disclosed it
 festive sijan chal rahaa he
 The festival of Diwali has arrived
 har taraf diwali kii raunak he
 The process of parties also starts as soon as Diwali arrives
 bollywood main bhi diwali parties shuru ho chuki hai
 Both Shah Rukh Khan and Shilpa Shetty hosted a party for their industry friends
 vaise bharat main koi bhi tyohaar ho bina gaanon ke adhuraa hi lagata he
 There are many songs of Bollywood films, which make Diwali quite special
 aaie najar daalate hai, aise hi bollywood ke top 8 song par, jinako sunakar diwali kaa jashn doguna kiya ja saktaa he
 The songs we are telling can be heard on the Internet or other medium
 ho saktaa he ki aapke paas ye collection ho bhi
 Some of the songs we are suggesting are Diwali, while many other songs are built on the party theme
 song- kabhi khushi kabhi gamfilm- kabhi khushi kabhi gamfilm: shirdi ke sai babasong: deepawali manaai suhanifilm: devdassong: silsilaa ye chahat kafilm- paigamsong- kaise diwali manaaeparty songafilm: badrinaath kii dulhaniyasong: tammaa tammaa aginfilm: i dil he mushkilsong: brallep songafilm: satyamev jayatesong: dilabarfilm: namaste englandsong: proper patola 21 to Salman Khan's film 'tubelight'
 15 karod kii opening mili he
 'tubelight' debuted at the Indian box office on day 21
 15 karod kaa kaarobaar kiya he
 Although this opening is quite good, according to the kind of collection that Salman Khan's previous film did at the box office, this opening is nothing special
 saath hi is film ke relies se pehle hi isse jabardast kamai kii ummid kii ja rahi thi lekin pehle din kii kamai us ummid tak nahin pahunch saki he
 Recall that Aamir Khan's film 'dangal' was released at a time when the country was going through a phase of notbandi
 us daur main 'dangal' ne pehle din 29
 Did a business of 78 crores
 salmaan kii hi 'sultan' ko 36
 54 crore was opened
 sultan ko is baat kaa phayda mila tha ki vah film id ke din chuttee par relies hui thi
 Here 'tubelight' is released without any holiday, yet the difference is big
 film 'tubalite' ko samikshakon se acchhee pratikriya nahin mili he
 Even the response of Salman Khan's fans is mixed with this film
 kuch darshakon ne is film ko dhimi mana he to kisi ne jajbaati kahani kahkar nakaar diya he
 Salman Khan also considers this film different from his previous films
 haalanki salmaan ko apni film ko mili is milijule rispons se niraash nahin hui he
 On an event by his brand Being Human and PVR, he said, 'I expected to get fewer numbers from critics, yet some reviewers gave one or one and a half numbers
 'tubalite' waisi film nahin he jahaan doston ke saath jaakar shor karen yaa maje karen
 This is an emotional story
 ' Talking about his film, Salman Khan said that 'tubelight' is an emotional drama that can be seen with the whole family
 jaahir he ki jab salmaan khud maanate hai ki tubalite main bahut masala nahin he to opening 21
 15 is also considerable and bears the brunt of his stardom as viewers expect a spicy and entertaining film from Salman
 'tubalite' ke liye raahat kii baat ye he ki 3 din ke weekend ke saath saath id kii chuttee hogi or id ke baad ghar se niklegi aise darshakon kii bheed jo ramajaan main film nahin dekhte
 The film 'tubelight' has not received a good response from critics
 yahaan tak kii salmaan khan ke phens kii pratikriya bhi is film ko lekar mili juli hi he
 Some viewers have considered this film to be slow, while some have rejected it as an emotional story
 salmaan khan bhi is film ko apni pichhali filmon se alag maanate hai
 However, Salman has not been disappointed with the mixed response to his film
 unhone apane brands beeing human or piviar ke ek event par kaha, 'mujhe samikshakon se or kam number milane kii ummid thi phir bhi kuch samikshakon ek yaa dedh number de die
 'tubelight' is not a film where you make noise or have fun with friends
 ye ek imotional karne vaali kahani he
 ' apni film ke bare main baat karte hue salmaan khan ne kaha ki 'tubalite' ek imotional drama he jo puure parivaar ke saath dekha ja saktaa he
 It is evident that when Salman himself believes that there is not much spice in the tubelight, then opening 21
 15 bhi kaaphi he or unke staradam kaa fal he kyonki darshak salmaan se masala or manoranjak film kii ummid karte hai
 The relief for 'tubelight' is that there will be a 3-day weekend as well as Eid holiday and after Eid, there will be a crowd of viewers who do not watch the film during Ramadan

 ’ The maximum number of deaths due to road accident in UP, most of the road accidents in Mizoram, Mizoram and Sikkim are the noise of the highest rates of invoice of the Motor Vehicle Act
 niyamon kaa ulanghan karne vaale logon se lekar kuch rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon tak ko chaalaan kii ye nai daren chubh rahi hai
 Many state governments either refused to implement these increased invoice rates and many are still considering it
 in sabake bich kendriya sadak evam parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ne kaha he ki badha hua jurmaana logon ke bhale ke liye hi he
 The number of people killed in road accidents in the country is very high
 india today kii data intelligence unit (DIU) ne paaya ki jo rajya bade hue jurmaane ko lagu karne se kataraa rahe hai, vahaan par sadak haadason kii sankhya bhi bahut zyada he
 For accidents, injuries and fatalities, the DIU investigated the report of the Ministry of Roads and Transport which details all road accidents up to 2017
 is report se pataa chalata he ki tamilnadu main us saal sabase zyada sadak durghatnaayen hui thi
 Tamil Nadu is followed by Madhya Pradesh where 53,399 accidents occurred
 karnataka (42,542), uttar pradesh (38,783), kerala (38,470) or maharashtra (35,853) main bhi yah aankada 30,000 se upar tha
 It is worth noting that all these states which fall in the top 6 list, are reluctant to implement the increased penalty

 purvottar ke teen rajya - nagaland (41), mizoram (60) or sikkim (78) main sadak durghatnaon se marane vaale logon kii sankhya sabase kam yani 100 se neeche thi
 The states with the highest number of accidents were also injured in the same states
 sadak haadason kii vajah se ghayal hone waalon kii sankhya sabase zyada tamilnadu main thi jahaan 74751 log haadason main chotil hue the
 Tamil Nadu is followed by Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Maharashtra with the highest number of injured
 haadason kii tivratamantralay kii report haadason kii tivrata kaa bhi varnan karti he
 The Ministry considered the rate of death per 100 accidents as the level of intensity
 jahaan mizoram sadak haadason se hone vaali mauton kaa aankada sabase kam tha vahiin isi rajya main sadak durghatnaon kii tivrata bhi jabase zyaada thi
 This is because as many as 60 people died in 68 accidents in Mizoram, leading to an intensity rate of 88
 2 tak pahunch gaya
 Mizoram is followed by Punjab where 71 out of every 100 accidents
 1 log maare gaye

 8), uttar pradesh (51
 9) and West Bengal (49
 6) jahaan sadak durghatnaon kii tivrata bahut zyada thi
 The intensity was lowest in Nagaland where only 7 per 100 accidents
 7 log hi maare gaye
 Among the road accidents, the lowest intensity recorded in Goa after Nagaland is that while the number of road accidents in Kerala was more than 38000 but deaths were very low
 kerala main hui har 100 sadak durghatnaon main keval 10
 Only 7 people died
 kerala ke alaava jammu kashmir or madhya pradesh main har 100 durghatnaon main marane vaale logon kii sankhya kam thi

 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main tikat bantwaare par virodh or baghawat ke chalate bhartiya janata party ko namakan ke aakhri din ummidawaron kii antim list jari kerani padi
 34 candidates were announced in this list, but the name of former Chief Minister Anandiben Patel could not be seen anywhere
 wo jis ghatlodia seat se vidhayak thim, vahaan se bhupendra patel ko tikat de diya gaya
 After this, questions are being raised as to why the sitting MLA and former cm's card was cut from the list of BJP candidates
 If this decision of BJP leadership is understood, then on the one hand, former Chief Minister of Gujarat misses Keshubhai Patel, on the other hand BJP It is seen from the side that it is trying to prove that it is in a strong position despite the opposition of the Patidars agitating for reservation
 keshubhai ko 2002 main nahin mila tha tikatapatidaaron ke aarakshan andolan par jab gujarat main bavaal ke baad karfu laga to puure desh main is sannaate par charchaa hui
 The Patidar movement turned into violence
 golibari, todphod or aagjanee dekhne ko mili
 There were deaths, people were injured, youth went to jail
 ye sab tab hua jab soobe kii kaman anandiben patel ke haathon main thi
 But after some time he had to relinquish the throne of CM
 2001 main jab gujarat par bukamp kaa kahar tutaa to tatkaaleen mukhyamantri keshubhai patel kii gaddi chali gai
 Keshubhai resigned citing health
 jabaki un par sarkaar chalaane main vifal hone, satta ke durupyog or bhrashtachar jaise aarope bhi charchaa kaa vishay rahe
 In his place Narendra Modi was given the responsibility of the post of Chief Minister
 magar, baat sirf siem pad jane tak hi simit nahin rahi, 2002 main jab vidhansabha chunaav hue bijepi ne unhen tikat bhi nahin diya
 At the same time, when Anandiben Patel resigned as CM in August 2016, she cited the age behind her decision
 unke istife ke baad ab jab 2017 main soobe main vidhansabha chunaav ho rahe hai to unhen chunavi raajnneeti se out kar diya gaya he
 This has happened when Anandiben recently hinted that she might consider contesting the election if the party says so
 ajtak se baat karte hue anandiben ne kaha tha ki agar party unhen aisa prastaav detii he to ve is par vichaar karengi
 She has even said that whether Ghatlodiya seat or someone else, the party leadership and delegation will decide who will contest from where
 somvaar ko dilli ke ashoka road sthit jis party mukhyalay se amit shah puure desh kii raajnneeti par faisle lete hai, vahaan se party netritv ne yah tay kar diya ki anandiben patel ghatlodia seat to kya kul 182 main se kisi bhi seat par chunaav nahin ladengi
 Even in 2001, the BJP ousted its most powerful Patel leader and former CM from electoral politics, while now in 2017, it has been decided not to contest the assembly elections for Gujarat's senior Petal leader and former CM
 patelon ke bina bhi majbootee kaa sandeshanandiben ko tikat na milane ke peeche unka 'patel' hona bhi ek vajah samajha ja rahaa he
 Even though the police have lashed out at the Patels demanding reservation during Anandiben's tenure, the denial of tickets to them is a big message from the party
 darasal, gujarat main patel samudaay bijepi kaa paramparaagat vot rahaa he
 But the Patidar movement started under Hardik Patel's leadership from 2015 became a distance from the BJP
 halaat ye ho gaye ki patidaar narendra modi or amit shah ke khilaaf khuleam bolne lage
 Started warning to defeat BJP
 yahaan tak bijepi netaaon ko chunaav prachaar ke dauraan kaale jhande dikhaane lage, unki sabhaaon main kursi phenkane lage
 In the end it happened that the Patidars declared their support to the Congress
 aise main gujarat ke badale siyaasi samikarnon ko dekhte hue ye sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he, kareeb do dashak se gujarat kii satta par kabiz bijepi ko kahin na kahin patidaaron kaa virodh baikfoot par le ja rahaa he
 The Congress is also positioning itself in strong position with the support of Patidar and OBC leader Alpesh Thakor and BJP opposition to Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani
 aise main bijepi ne apni party kii patel netaa or purv mukhyamantri ko tikat na dekar apni jeet or patelon ke virodh ke baavjood apni majboot stithi ko lekar aashwast hone kaa sandesh bhi dene kii koshish kii he
 Concerned over the increasing influence of corporate interests over national political parties like BJP, former Union Minister Arun Shourie has said that he was removed as the keynote speaker in the discussion on the budget because there was a possibility that He will oppose a proposal that could benefit industrialist Mukesh Ambani
 corporate jagat kii jansampark adhikari nira radia kii netaaon or patrakaron ke saath hui baatcheet ke tepe kaa haal hi main khulaasa hone ke sandarbh main shouri ne kaha ki isamen koi andeh nahin he ki ek tepe se yah saaf he ki kisi ne unke sthaan par venkaiya naidu ko varsh 2009 main bajet par sansad main hui charchaa main party kaa mukhya vaktaa banavaane kii vyavastha kii thi
 In an interview to a private channel, Shourie said that the motive behind his removal becomes clear through tapes as people doing so would fear that he would oppose a budget proposal that would help Mukesh Ambani
 unhone kaha, ‘aisa isaliye hua kyonki maine ek prastaav vishesh ke bare main party kii baithak main pratikul tippanee thi
 i mean to say how he came to know about it
 unhen kisi bhi tarah se is bare main maaloom chalaa or nishchit taur par yah unki ashanka hi thi
 i could or could not say anything about it in the House

 'singhm' bhi alag nahin he
 There is no convict in the jail of Police Inspector Bajirao Singham of Shivgarh town on Goa border
 maamle aapasi samaj boojh se rafa dfa ho jate hai
 The villagers are his friends, but then the entry is made by Villain Jayakant Shikre who has to attend the police station of Singham for two weeks
 interwel tak 'singhm' bahut hi thandi he
 The story Ghisi Piti Hai treatment is similar to the village films of the 80s and 90s
 naa gaanv waalon kii kamedi hansaati he naa inspector kii lav story dil ko chooti he ection bhi kam hi he
 Life in the film comes after Interval when the main villain and the hero face off
 yahaan ajay devgan ke kai achche ection seens hai
 a strong villain like Prakash Raj says that i have a mother but not a daughter
 or hero kaa kahana he ki meri zaruuratein kam hai isiilie mere zamir main dam he
 When the ego of the two collides, the audience gets a chance to beat the applause
 jahaan 'singhm' kii signechar toun maahaul main josh bharti he vahiin kamazor music isaki hawa nikaal detaa he
 Surprising how the corrupt police department of an entire city becomes honest overnight
 story music or kerectorizeshan ke maamle main 'singhm' 'dabang' se kamazor he
 Singham is a neat film and made for family audiences
 villen prakaash raaj or ajay devgan barabari se acting ke maidan main date hai
 Still it is an average film because director Rohit Shetty has chosen a weak script
 agar aapako interwel tak kagaz kaa sher dekhnaa he to 'singhm' aapke liye he
 My rating for the film is 2
 5 star

 The last three batsmen of the West Indies scored 75 runs in total but this only reduced the margin of defeat
 lunch ke samay bharat ko jeet ke liye ek wicket chahie tha lekin duusare satr main use yah wicket aasaani se nahin mila

 Praveen's ball bounced off the leg stump completely

 jab mishra gendbaaji ke liye aaye to long aaf, long aan, deep midmicket, deep squaire leg par kshetrarakshan sajaa diya gaya
 Sammy tried to teach a lesson to Mishra's first ball but it did not come completely on his bat and went into the safe hands of VVS Laxman in the extra cover
 saimi ne 11 gend par 25 ran banaaye
 Brandon Nash (nine runs) was quite defensive but Mishra also disrupted his concentration in the next over
 naish gend ko pul karne se chook gayi or wicket ke aage hone ke kaaran ampire ko unhen elbeadblyoo out dene main koi dikkat nahin hui
 The tail batsmen left no stone unturned to increase India's wait for victory
 ravi rampal ne 32 gend par chah chaukon or ek chakke kii madad se 34, debendra bishu ne 26 or fidel edwards ne naabad 16 ran banaaye

 Rampal, however, was not happy with the decision as it was the third bouncer of the over and it should have been Noble
