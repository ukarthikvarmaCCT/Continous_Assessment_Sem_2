 dilli sarkaar ne do saal main kiye apane kaamon kaa bakhaan kiya, to bijepi bhi report card taiyaar karne main peeche nahin rahi
 bjp's Delhi state president Manoj Tiwari came out with Kejriwal's report card on Tuesday, leaving no stone unturned to surround Kejriwal
 dilli bijepi ke report card main dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar ko das main se mines teen number die gaye hai
 BJP is also giving the reason why the report card of Delhi government went into minus marking
 dilli sarkaarne apane mantriyon se alag-alag report card taiyaar karavaaya he, jisamen sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon kaa bakhaan kiya gaya he
 In two years, advertisements have been published in newspapers along with Kejriwal's photo to describe his government as unmatched

 BJP has prepared a series of report cards on behalf of the government denying the achievements
 dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne report card jari karte hue kaha ki sarkaar ko jo karnaa chahie tha, usne wo bhi nahin kiya
 The day-to-day work of the government, the government could not do it properly, but the government system has become more collapsed
 aise main sarkaar kaa saamaanya kaamkaaj bhi shunya rahaa he
 That is why out of ten they cannot be given any number by any means
 balki do saal ke dauraan sarkaar ne aise kaam kiye, jisase na sirf dilli kaa nuksaan hua, balki dilli waalon ke saath dhokhaa bhi hua
 Manoj Tiwari said that Kejriwal came to power by promising an honest government against corruption, but in two years, three ministers had to remove him from the cabinet
 vah bhi bhrashtachar or farjiwade ke maamle main
 Not only this, the ministers of the party claiming political purity were surrounded and jailed on charges of exploitation of women in the name of ration cards
 kai vidhayakon par aapraadhik maamle darj hue
 In such a situation, Kejriwal betrayed the people of Delhi
 tiwari ne kaha ki 70 point vaale ghoshnaa patr main se koi bhi vaada kejariwal puraa nahin kar paae, balki jo vakt dilli kii janata kii seva main lagaana chahie tha, use unhone takaraav or jhagade main ganvaa diya
 Spent the money of Delhiites for their political propaganda
 aise main kejariwal sarkaar kaa report card mines main number kaa hi hakdaar he

 For SP, this is not just a seat but a matter of 'family respect'
 darasal kaint seat se mulaayam singh yadav kii choti bahu aparnaa yadav chunavi maidan main hai
 Her fight is with Rita Bahuguna Joshi, who is contesting on a BJP ticket this time
 reeta pichley chunaavon main kaint seat se hi congress ke tikat par chunaav jiti thim
 Now BJP has a vote bank with them, that is why the Samajwadi Party has tightened its back to win Aparna
 puraa parivaar aayaa agebuudhvaar ko aparnaa kii khatir mulaayam singh ne prachaar kiya or raily main hissaa liya
 Mulayam Singh had said, "aparna is the daughter-in-law of my boy, so it is my honor

 "on Thursday, Akhilesh Yadav is also going to rally in Cantt assembly seat to create atmosphere in Aparna's favor
 shivpal ke liye keval mulaayam gaye thegoratlab he ki shivpal ke liye chunaav prachaar karne keval mulaayam singh yadav gaye the jabaki aparnaa yadav ke liye prachaar-prasar puure kunbe ne sambhaal rakhi he
 Both have common factor - Rita Bahuguna Joshi and Aparna Yadav both belong to Uttarakhand
 - kshetra ke pahari voton par he donon kii najar
 - Rita Bahuguna Joshi's father Hemwanti Nandan Bahuguna has been the ninth Chief Minister of UP
 jabaki aparnaa yadav ke sasur mulaayam singh yadav teen baar upi kii satta sambhaal chuke hai
 What is the caste equation of the seat: About 3 in this assembly seat
 5 lakh voter hai
 Among them, there are about 60 thousand Brahmin voters
 uske baad pahari matadaataaon kii sankhya he joki 30 hajaar ke aas-paas he
 Among other caste voters, there are about 50 thousand Dalits, 40 thousand Vaishyas, 30 thousand backward class people, 25 thousand Kshatriyas and 20 thousand Muslims
 kya kahata he chunavi ganitis kshetra main brahman matadaata kii chunaavon main ahm bhoomika maani jaati rahi he
 Rita Bahuguna had made a dent in the Sindhi and Pahari vote bank as well as the Brahmin vote bank in the last election

 95, 25 to BJP
 51 or sapa ko 13
 It was 93 percent of the vote
 reeta bahuguna is baar bijepi se hai, pichhali baar ve congress kii ummidavaar thim
 Now it has to be seen whether Rita can retain her vote share or Aparna will benefit from the vote share of Congress
 saat baar congress or paanch baar bhaajapa kii jeetkaint se ab tak jite pratyaashiyon kii baat karen to 1957 main congress se shyaam manohar mishra, 1962 main congress se balak ram vaisya, 1967 main nirdaleey beepi avasthi, 1969 main bhartiya kranti dal se sachchidanand, 1974 main congress se charan singh, 1977 main janata party se krishnakanth mishra, 1980, 1985 or 1989 main congress se premavati tiwari, 1991 or 1993 main bhaajapa se satish bhaatia, 1996, 2002, 2007 main bijepi se suresh chandra tiwari, 2012 main congress se reeta bahuguna joshi

 Apart from this, Yogi had also criticized the sp-bsp-congress, saying that these people go on stage and shout ali-ali and only want to send a green virus to this country and culture but in the grip of this green virus, the West There is no need to bring UP
 ye tamaam tark dete hue yogi adityanath ne chunaav ayog se kaha tha ki unhone apane bhaashan main dharm yaa jati ke naam par vot nahin maanga he na hi aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan kiya he
 But Yogi's plea has been sidelined by the Election Commission and has banned his campaign for 72 hours

 An insane 6-year-old Payal was injured by a mad dog, who would see any shudder after seeing and hearing it
 ghatana beete shanivaar kii he
 In Mirzapur village of Ghazipur, 70 km from Banaras, Payal was playing outside her home with about 10-12 children of her age
 tabhi achaanak kahin se bhure rang kaa ek kutta daudta hua aayaa or sidhe uske munh par atake kar diya
 By the time she could recover, her mouth had settled in the dog's jaw
 aasapaas sab bachche hi the lihaaja achaanak hue is hamale se sab ghabara gayi or cheekhney chillane lage
 Hearing their noise, the dog scratched a part of Payal's mouth, which was stuck in his jaw and ran away
 paayal ke chaaron taraf khun hi khun fail gaya
 Seeing this situation, the senses of his family were blown away
 kisi ko kuch samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha kya karen
 Payal's pain was unbearable and his scream was bringing the whole family into disarray
 dekhte dekhte is ghatana kii khabar puure gaanv main fail gai
 The case was so strange that everyone's feet ran towards Payal's house
 tamaam koshishon ke baavjood munh se khun ruk nahin rahaa tha
 Somehow, the blood-soaked Payal took his house and the villagers to the nearby Sai Nath Hospital where the doctors were also surprised to see his condition
 foran unhone praathmik upachaar kar kisi tarah chot se behate khun ko roak kar pattee kii or banaras bade aspataal ke liye refer kar diya
 At around 10 o'clock at night, his family arrived at the Emergency of Galaxy Hospital in Varanasi with Payal

 Rajiv Kumar, anesthetic Prashant Sahay and other doctors were called

 ab paayal kii haalat thik he lekin puri tarah uske chehre ko thik karne ke liye kuch samay baad phir se plastic surgery kii jaayegi
 The dog that made Payal's condition disappeared, but it was discovered that this dog has bitten five to six people from the village itself
 ek kute kaa kisi maasoom kaa is tarah munh noch lenaa apane aap main ek bahut dardanaak ghatana he jo shaayad hi kabhi suni gai ho

 banaras se 70 kilometre dur ghazipur ke mirzapur gaanv main paayal apane hamaumr taqariban 10-12 bacchon ke saath ghar ke baahar khel rahi thi
 Suddenly, a brown dog came running from somewhere and directly attacked his mouth
 jab tak wo sanbhal paati tab tak uskaa munh kute ke jabade main samaa chukaa tha
 All the children were around, so all of a sudden this attack made them nervous and started screaming
 unka shor sun kar jab tak bade aate tab tak kute ne apane jabade main jakade paayal ke munh ke ek hisse ko noch daalaa or bhaag gaya
 Blood spilled all around Payal
 uski is dasha ko dekh kar uske parivaar waalon ke hosh ud gayi

 This tree is a symbol of Trimurti, Vishnu in its bark, Brahma in the root and Shiva in the branches is considered to be inhabited
 jis prakaar pipal ko vishnu ji kaa pratik mana jaataa he, usee prakaar bargad ko shiv ji mana jaataa he

 - Medicines are also made from its bark and leaves

 After this, sit under the Vatavriksha and chant Shani Mantra
 - ye prayog karne vaale ko kabhi bhi koi grah pidaa nahin de saktaa chaahe wo shani ho yaa rahu
 In this way, worship will be done to get children - as far as possible plant banyan tree and get it planted
 - har somvaar ko bargad kii jad main jal daalen
 After this, sit under it and chant "om Namah Shivaya" at least 11 beads
 - aapaki santan utpatti kii abhilaashaa sheeghra se sheeghra puri hog
 In this way, married life will be good - go near the tree tree in the morning with yellow cotton, flowers and water
 - iske baad pehle vat vriksh ke neeche ghi kaa deepak jalaaen 
 - Then add water to the root of the tree and offer flowers
 - vat vriksh kii 9 baar parikrama karen or pili soot uske tane main lapetate jaaen

 Watson has been with the team since the first season and therefore knows every player on the team well

 main ummid karata hum ki main apane prati team prabandhan or prashansakon kii aakankshaon par khara utaruunga
 Maneka Gandhi is always in the news whether inside or outside the office
 lekin narendra modi sarkaar main mantri banane ke baad unhone jis tarah apane daayre ko badhaayaa he usase ve log bhi hairaan hai jo unki kisi bhi apratyaashit harakat ko sahaj bhav se pachaa lete the
 In fact, he went beyond the scope of his ministerial post and presided over the official meeting on animal welfare
 yon to is vishay par ve samarpit bhav se lagaataar kaam karti rahi hai, lekin ab yah vishay paryaavaran or van mantri prakaash javdekar ke hisse aata he
 Maneka holds the reins of the Ministry of Women and Child Development

 The program was organized by the Ministries of Health and Environment together

 Interestingly, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan and Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar did not attend this meeting
 mahila or bal vikaas mantralay kii website ke mutabik pashu kalyaan kaarykram or rebies niyantran ‘‘sweekrut vishyon’’ main se nahin hai
 When India Today spoke to Gandhi in this regard, he said that it was an informal meeting in which, as an "aware citizen" and MP, she wanted to know why this pilot program was stopped
 ‘‘main kuch samay se is kaarykram se judi hui hum or yah jaananaa chaahati thi ki ise ab tak shuru kyon nahin kiya gaya?’’ ve bataati hai, ‘‘maine baithak kii adhyakshata nahin kii
 It was all informal
 main pilibhit ke saansad ke rup main rasmi taur vahaan gai thi
 i am concerned about the issue of rabies and am therefore associated with this program
 main ise akhil bhartiya str tak le janaa chaahati hum
 The documents related to this meeting clearly state that the implementation of the National Rabies Control Program (NRCP) in the state of Haryana was considered in a meeting held at Shastri Bhavan on June 24, 2014 under the chairmanship of Women and Child Welfare Minister Maneka Gandhi
 And he reviewed the progress of NRCP animal related work in Haryana and Rahul Sehgal (director, Asia Humane Society Internet Nal) asked why progress is slow? ”gandhi claimed that no decision was taken in the meeting
 jab unase kaha gaya ki baithak ke byore main kharch main sanshodhan ke sambandh main kiya gaya faisla saaf taur par darj he to unhone kaha ki yah sirf unka nahin, balki baithak main shaamil ‘‘sabhi logon’’ kaa he
 He insisted, "I just wanted to know why the program had not been started yet
" echesai ke rahul sahagal ne kaha ki 650 ru
 It is not possible to do this (dog sterilization) and Rs 1,200 on this work in Maharashtra
 kharch aata he
 So everyone decided to revise it
 mujhe to isamen or koi baat nahin najar aati?’’24 june kii baithak main mahatvapurn faisle kiye gaye-nasbandi or tikaakaran vyay main sanshodhan, encidisi ko nirdesh ki edblubiai ke nae vaahan kii kharid kii manaahi ke pichley nirdeshon main sanshodhan kare or rebies par jaagrukta paidaa karne ke kaam main aane vaale atirikt kharch (kam-se-kam 1 karod ru
 ) Was raised by the Union Ministry of Health
 gandhi kii baithak ke byore main likhaa he ki yah faisla kiya gaya ki ‘‘kutton kii nasbandi or tikaakaran main aane vaale kharch kii dar kramshah 650 ru
 And Rs 90
 kii bajaae 700 ru
 And Rs 100
 hogi
 In the last meeting held on NRCP in the Ministry of Environment in early April this year, representatives of HSI and World Wide Veterinary Services participated in which it was decided that the rate of sterilization and vaccination was Rs 650 per dog respectively
 or 90 ru
 Should not exceed vyay main sanshodhan kaa arth hoga 2
 5 crores Rs
 kii atirikt raashi kaa bhaar, jabaki anumaan he ki haryana main saat lakh aawaara kutton main se sirf paanch lakh kii nasbandi karai gai he
 It was further decided in the meeting that the Ministry of Health will write to the Haryana Government to provide additional trains / infrastructure / accommodation from each district to HIS to "make the program a success"
 paryaavaran or swasthya mantralay pehle is par sahamat the ki payalat kaarykram main agle teen saal main 12veen yojana ke tahat haryana main kute kii aabaadi ke kam-se-kam 70 fisadi cover kiye jaaen
 AWBI invited those who are willing to work in this direction to participate in this year's program
 teen sanghathanon ne ichha jaahir kii thi
 Only two of these — HSI and World Wide Veterinary Services — made the presentation
 jahaan kareeb 12 saal pehle sarkaar ne nasbandi dar 445 ru
 But many bodies had fixed the dogs' sterilization rates at Rs 700-1,200
 tak kii badhotaree kii he
 It is reported that apart from rabies control, Gandhi is also taking keen interest in the Animal Welfare Division of the Ministry of Environment
 shaayad ve aisa adatan kar jaati hai
 He also took charge of this division while taking charge of the Ministries of Culture and Program Implementation and Statistics during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government
 gandhi harith mantralay ke adheen rashtriya pashu kalyaan santhaan kii jimmedaari ek mashhoor wild life kaaryakarta ko saunpane kii pairvi kar rahi hai
 The Union Environment Ministry had to cite its rules that in order to give a fair chance to all, an expression of interest has to be invited so that the person or NGO concerned gets an equal opportunity
 lekin mahila or bal vikaas mantri gandhi is baat se inkaar karti hai ki unhone santhaan par kisi vyakti vishesh ke liye dabaav daalaa tha
 This meeting of Maneka Gandhi has already created a new trouble for the Modi government, which is surrounded by the system and the observance of the traditions
 vaise ek najariya yah bhi ho saktaa he ki jahaan baaki mantriyon ko ek-ek kaam karne ke liye piemo kaa munh taakna padataa he, vahiin menka aisi mantri hai jo apane to kya baaki mantralayon ke kaam main bhi aaraam se dakhal de rahi hai
 The news of the meeting comes at a time when seven-time Lok Sabha MP Gandhi is trying to build a strong ground for his son Lok Sabha MP Varun Gandhi while trying to increase his political influence
 unhone haal hi main ek bayaan dekar varun ko bijepi kii ore se uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri pratyaashee ke rup main pesh karne ke liye dabaav banaaya he
 At the moment it is delayed
 isi bich ve aise muddon ko uthaa rahi hai jinhen baari sankhya main logon kaa samarthan milane kii ummid he-kishor nyaay adhinium ke tahat kishor kii umr seemaa ko ghataakar 16 saal karnaa or gharelu hinsa vidheyak ke tahat saas ko bhi shaamil karnaa
 This kind of activism of Gandhi seems like an attempt to regain his old influence
 lekin desh ke sabase puraane siyaasi khandaan kii parityakt vaaris ko yah samajhnaa chahie ki narendra modi sarkaar kii tarj vaajapeyi sarkaar se alag he
 The enthusiastic Samajwadi Party (SP) does not want to leave any stone unturned for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections after winning the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections

 haal hi main badi sienji kii keemton ne sienji car chalaane waalon ko pareshaani main daal diya he
 Once considered eco friendly as well as pocket friendly, CNG is now competing with diesel in terms of price
 dilli jaise shahar main har roj safar karne vaale kai logon ke liye sienji ne raah aasaan kar di thi
 But now CNG prices are also increasing continuously
 alam ye he ki dilli main sienji ke daam dijal ke bahut kareeb pahunch gayi hai
 The question arises whether clean fuel cars such as CNG are still economical for everyday commuters
 auto export tutu dhawan, ke anusaar ‘keemat badhane ke saath sienji kaa jo asli makasad tha wo khatm hota ja rahaa he
 Now there is only one purpose left that pollution is reduced with it
 keemat ke hisaab se dekha jaae to sienji bhi dijal ke baraabar hoti ja rahi he
 Whereas diesel engines are better
 ’dilli main philhal sienji kii keemat 50 rupee 10 paise prati kilogram he, jabaki dijal kii keemat 54 rupee 34 paise he
 In Noida, you have to pay 56 rupees 70 paise for 1 kg of CNG
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki mentenance ke maamle main bhi sienji kaaren dijal se chalane vaali kaaron se peeche hi hai, upar se car companiyaan dijal ingine ko or ripine karne main lagi hai
 In such a situation, it is natural to question the economy of CNG powered cars
 honda jaisi car companiyon ne to sienji kii keemat or sienji se chalane vaali car kii maang ko dekhte hue apane iklaute sienji verient ko band karne kaa faisla kar liya he
 Says Gyaneshwar Sen, Senior Vice President, Honda Cars, "the matter of profit is different, first of all we have to see if there will be any demand in the way CNG prices are going up
 pichhali vaali honda city main hamaara sienji verient tha par jo teji se keemat badi he, use dekhte hue philhal nai city main ham sienji nahin laae hai
 'car manufacturers can put a brake on their production along with increasing or decreasing demand, but those who have bought CNG cars as a cheaper option

 It is only on mixing these things that the India that Atal ji created
 sansad se sadak tak res course se lekar bank street tak sikkhad patrkaar ke taur par atal yug ko khabaron main baandhte hamen kabhi yah ehsaas hi nahin hua ham itihaas report kar rahe the
 i wish we had known the Internet then even today that Atal's governments were an infinite outpouring of political courage and it was in no way smaller than the sky of his passionate poetry
 kitna vakt mila tha atal ko yug badalane ke liye?keval chah saal hi na?kya koi keval ek dashak se kam samay ke raajnneetik netritv main yug bana yaa badal saktaa he?or vah bhi alpamat kii sarkaron kaa netritv karte hue?shaayad aisa karne ke liye use atal saahsee hona padegaa
 The period of Atal ji's six-year government is the biggest era of political courage in India
 kya bejod sankraman the ve, jo bejod saahas se sanbhale gaye
 India had opened the doors to connect with foreign countries
 1991 ke sankat kaa ilaaj puraa hote hote vaajapeyi raashtrapati ke paas (1996) sarkaar banane kaa daawa karne pahunch gaye
 Courage of nuclear testing amid new climate of economic liberalization! After that, international sanctions! India raised Rs 8,700 crore by issuing bonds in the world market despite the restrictions
 aaj hamen maananaa hoga ki parmaanu pareekshan ne duniya main ek nayaa brands india banaaya
 But Pokhran's courage was not alone in this
 bharat ke itihaas main sabase aakraamak udaarikaran, pokharan jaise hi josh ke saath prarambh hua
 The country came to know for the first time what the structural reforms are, that is, how the structure of the country and the economy is changed
 aayaat shulkan main kami,videshi nivesh ko nyonta,nijeekaran kii lahar,arthvyavastha main sarkari bhoomika main kami
 The construction of roads, the expansion of mobiles were known to us, but before that the disputes in which the telecom sector was involved was the first and the biggest transition of privatization in India
 yaa phir bharat main bajet ke ghaaton ko kanoon se baandhna hojiasti kii buniyaad rakhana ho,swatantra niamak sansthaaon jaise pratispardhaa ayog kaa gathan
 All this is perhaps not easily remembered as post-pak transition, Pakistan, Kargil, Kandahar, Agra summit failures, attacks on Parliament were going to come
 kya koi vishwaas karegaa ki jo chah varsh bharat ke liye kootneeti, yuddh, aatankwaad or antarrashtriya morche par sabase bade sankramanon ke the, usee daur main bharat ne duniya main sabase tej vikaas dar hasil kii
 That phase of eight percent growth did not return again
 namanmohan singhke netritv main or na aaj hi
 How could Atal ji do this? In those moments of transition, he stood between the South and the Left poles with loyalty, devotion and faith among the anti-poles
 ek taraf unka apana rudhivaadee parivaar tha yani ki dakshinpanth jo videshi nivesh se lekar pakistan se dosti or samaveshi raajnneeti ke paksh main nahin tha
 Which he did not let himself dominate
 duusari taraf tab kaa majbutavampanthajise nijeekaran, udaarikaran or sudhaaron se chidh thi, jisaki madad se unhone iraq main sena bhejne ke dabaav kaa saamana kiya
 The transitions that India saw under Atal ji's leadership were far greater than the reforms due to which India today has a new modern economy
 do dhruvon ke bich atal rah kar atal ji ne, ek dashak se kam samay main bich jo kiya uskaa shrey kabhi nahin liya
 And by the time the country could understand his promise, he engaged in dialogue with the formless

 The beginnings of football in India can be traced back to the late 18th century
 is daur main bahut se nae klbon or toornamenton kii shuruyaat hui
 But the real boom in Indian football came when in 1911 Mohun Bagan defeated the East Yorkshire Regiment 2–1 to win the title of IFA Shield
 yah pehali baar tha jab kisi bhartiya team ne koi bada rashtriya cap jeeta tha
 The Durand Cup started in 1888 The Durand Cup was started in Shimla in 1888 by India's then Foreign Secretary Mortimer Durand, the world's third oldest football competition after Britain's FA Cup and Scotland's Scottish Cup
 bharat main rah rahe angrej sainikon ke liye shuru kii gai is pratiyogita kaa pehla khitaab royal scout fusilors ne hiland lite inphantry ko haraakar jeeta tha
 In 1893, IFA Shield was started in the then capital of India, Calcutta, which is the fourth oldest football competition in the world
 baad main kalakatta bharat main footbal ke sabase bade centre ke rup main viksit hua
 One of the oldest clubs in the world, Mohun Bagan, established in 1889, is the oldest football club in India
 haalanki mohan bagan epasi kii sthapana mohan bagan sporting club ke naam se hui thi
 The first Indian Federation, the Indian Football Association, was established in 1893 although there was not a single Indian in it
 san 1930 se bhartiya team ne australia, japan, malaysia,indonesia or thailand kaa daura karnaa shuru kar diya
 The All India Football Federation was established in 1937
 bade manch par mili niraashaazadee ke baad bharat kaa pehla bada antarrashtriya toornament 1948 kaa landan olympic tha jisamen nange pair khilne vaali bhartiya team ko kade sangharsh ke baad apane pehle match main france se 2-1 se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 The only goal of the match for India was scored by Sarangapani Raman, which is also India's first international goal in the Olympics
 us match main bharat kii haar ke peeche mukhya kaaran uskaa do penalty kik miss karnaa tha
 After this, Team India also participated in the Olympics in 1952, 1956, 1960 but during this time the team could win only one match
 or 1960 ke baad to ham kabhi bhi olympic ke liye kwalifai hi nahin kar paae hai
 AIFF missed the opportunity Team India had its biggest chance to make its mark on the world stage when the withdrawal of name by most of the countries playing in the FIFA World Cup in Brazil in 1950 led the Indian football team to the World Cup
 Received an invitation to play
 lekin us vakt kii AIFF kii gavarning body us maukey kii mahatta nahin samaj pai
 FIFA agreed to bear most of the travel expenses when AIFF was told that there was no money to come, but then the AIFF made different excuses and gave the Olympic more than the FIFA World Cup to the Indian team history i missed registering name
 bahaanon se sthiti nahin sudhartilogon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki 1948 ke olympic main bhartiya team dwaara nange pair bhaag lene ke baad se fifa ne nange pair footbal khilne par pratibandh lagane kaa faisla kiya tha, jiske kaaran bhartiya team ne vishwa cap main khilne se manaa kar diya tha
 However, according to the then Indian football team captain Shailen Manna, there was no truth in these reports, rather the rumors were blamed to hide the mistake of AIFF
 vishwa cap khelnaa he sapanakhair baat kuch bhi rahi ho lekin sachai ye he ki is maukey ko ganvaane ke baad bharat 1985 se lagaataar kwalifyres khel rahaa he lekin 2014 fifa worldcup tak kabhi bhi fifa vishwa cap ke kwalifire round ke pehle charan ko bhi paar nahin kar paaya he
 Although in the qualifier of FIFA World Cup 2018, we have defeated Nepal in the first round and have qualified for the second leg but we have also lost two consecutive matches there
 1970,80 or 90 ke dashak main bhartiya footbal kii haalat bahut kharaab rahi haalanki usne 1984 ke asian cap ke liye kwalifai kiya jahaan use group bi main rakhaa gaya tha
 Team selection has often been disputed, India could not win a single match in this competition, although it did draw a match, but the embarrassing thing is that India could not score a single goal in this entire competition
 bharat ke is pradarshan ke baad se team chayan par bahut se sawaal uthe the

 There are days when many people have withdrawn money from their cards

 MD Pandey withdrew Rs 10,000 from the ATM of State Bank of Patiala in Kanjhawala and on the same night someone withdrew Rs 35,000 from the ATM of Union Bank of India in Gurgaon

 In the report, the company providing ATM facility has said that it is the job of banks to update their software
 is kaaran haikaron ke liye in atm mashiinon ke zariye aapke card ko hack karnaa kahin zyada aasaan ho gaya he
 ATM machines worldwide are replaced in five years

 hamane isiaisiai bank kii niyamavali jaakar padhane kaa prayaas kiya ki aisi sthiti main bank aapse kya vaada karata he
 There is Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI) in India, banks are its members
 isi ke anusaar isiaisiai bank ne vaada kiya he ki kisi frod ke maamle main agar bank maan letaa he ki galati uski yaa uske staff kii he to bank apana daayitv sweekaar karegaa or clem chukaayegaa
 When there is no fault of any branch or consumer in case of fraud, the bank will compensate the loss of the consumer to an extent
 job racket, latary yaa email ke zariye fund transfar jaisaa frod hone par bank tay karegaa ki kya uske staff ne aisa kiya he
 On proving this, the bank will settle its claim and repay you
 bank kii galati hoti hogi, to bank puraa paisa chukaayegaa
 If there is no fault of the consumer or the bank, if something happens in the system, then only Rs 5000 will be paid
 wo bhi puure jivan main is tarah kaa bhugtan ek baar hoga
 If it is fraudulent again, it will not be even five thousand
 online baking aaj kii sachai he
 Its use will increase, but its risks are also similar
 ab aapako samajhnaa yah he ki agar aapkaa paisa pal bhar main kisi ne gaayab kar liya to kya aap use saal bhar main bhi waapas le paayenge
 Do you know what to do and how generously the police and banks will help you
 banking code kisi frod kii sthiti main bainkon ko bachaane ke liye he yaa upabhokta ko
 These are all new topics, about which not only you, we journalists also need to know
 to aaj ham 'prime time' main yahi baat karenge ki bina online baking main galati kii javabdehi bank par zyada hoti he, lekin online baking main galati kii javabdehi upabhokta par zyada hoti he
 Why is this and what should you do to avoid it
 zaruri he ki jab lakhon-karodon logon ko ek saath online yaa internet banking system ke daayre main laayaa ja rahaa he to unhen suraksha ko lekar bhi usee paimaane par satark kiya jaae
 There is a lot of possibility of fraud with new customers
 aap laaparvaahee na bhi karen to bhi guarantee nahin he ki daaka nahin padegaa
 The gang of online robbers does not live in any wall, but takes away your account money from Russia and Rumania
 hamen dekhnaa hoga ki jis tezi se lakhon log cashles system ko apana rahe hai, kya us tezi se hamaari police is laayak ho saki he ki wo sibar suraksha bhang hone par turant paisa or insaaf dilaa sake

 Shail Singh's report appeared in Monday's Economic Times that hacking 70 per cent of India's ATM machines is not a difficult task as all these atms run on Windows XP software, which Microsoft has secured since April 2014
 Has stopped doing
 report main atm suvidha uplabdh karaane vaali company ne kaha he ki yah kaam bainkon kaa he ki ve apane software ko apadet karen
 For this reason it has become much easier for hackers to hack your card through these ATM machines
 duniya bhar main atm mashiinon ko paanch saal main badal diya jaataa he
 New software is installed, but they are not replaced in India for ten years
 inhen hataaya bhi jaataa he, to nasht karne kii jagah kisi duusari jagah par laga diya jaataa he
 There is no Microsoft statement in this report, but this report of 'economic Times' forces us to think a lot
 dilli ke shahdara ke lokesh jain ne bhi cashles daur ke maahaul main mobile banking kaa ap down lod kiya, lekin jab ve apane mobile wolet se bijli bill bharne gaye to pataa chalaa ki unke khate se 17,580 rupee gaayab ho chuke hai
 Zero balance was showing in his account
 unhone police se shikaayat kar di he or jaanch chal rahi he
 The comments isi saal farvari main bangladesh ke central bank se 660 karod rupee uda liye gaye
 No major banking fraud has happened in the world till now
 abhi tak ye paisa waapas nahin hua he
 When the bank cannot withdraw its money, how will it give your looted money
 itani aasaani se to nahin degaa
 We tried to go through the ICICI Bank manual to read what the bank promises you in such a situation
 bharat main Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI) he, bank iske sadsy hote hai
 Accordingly, ICICI Bank has promised that in case of a fraud, if the bank believes that the mistake is made by him or his staff, the bank will accept its liability and pay the claim
 frod hone par jab branch yaa upabhokta main se kisi kii galati nahin hogi, to ek seemaa tak bank upabhokta ke nuksaan kii bharpai karegaa
 In case of fraud like fund transfer through job racket, lottery or email, the bank will decide if its staff has done so
 aisa sabit hone par bank apana daawa tay karegaa or aapako chukaa degaa
 If the bank made a mistake, then the bank would pay the entire money
 agar upabhokta yaa bank main se kisi kii galati nahin hogi, system main kisi gadabadi se aisa hoga to 5000 rupee tak hi chukaaya jayega
 That too will be such a payment once in the whole life
 agar dobaaraa frod ho gaya to paanch hazaar bhi nahin milegaa
 Online banking is the reality today
 iskaa istemaal badhegaa hi lekin iske khatare bhi utane hi hai
 Now you have to understand that if someone lost your money in a moment, would you be able to take it back in a year
 kya aapako pataa he ki kya-kya karnaa he or police or bank kitni udaartaa se aapaki madad karenge
 The banking code is intended to protect banks or consumers in the event of a fraud
 yah sab nae vishay hai, jinke bare main aapako hi nahin, ham patrakaron ko bhi jaanane-samajhane kii zarurat he
 So today we will talk in 'prime time' that without online banking the fault is more on the accountability of the bank, but in online banking the fault is more on the accountability of the consumer
 aisa kyon he or aapako bachane ke liye kya karnaa chahie

 There is no Microsoft statement in this report, but this report of 'economic Times' forces us to think a lot
 dilli ke shahdara ke lokesh jain ne bhi cashles daur ke maahaul main mobile banking kaa ap down lod kiya, lekin jab ve apane mobile wolet se bijli bill bharne gaye to pataa chalaa ki unke khate se 17,580 rupee gaayab ho chuke hai
 Zero balance was showing in his account

 The comments isi saal farvari main bangladesh ke central bank se 660 karod rupee uda liye gaye
 No major banking fraud has happened in the world till now
 abhi tak ye paisa waapas nahin hua he
 When the bank cannot withdraw its money, how will it give your looted money
 itani aasaani se to nahin degaa
 We tried to go through the ICICI Bank manual to read what the bank promises you in such a situation
 bharat main Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI) he, bank iske sadsy hote hai
 Accordingly, ICICI Bank has promised that in case of a fraud, if the bank believes that the mistake is made by him or his staff, the bank will accept its liability and pay the claim
 frod hone par jab branch yaa upabhokta main se kisi kii galati nahin hogi, to ek seemaa tak bank upabhokta ke nuksaan kii bharpai karegaa
 In case of fraud like fund transfer through job racket, lottery or email, the bank will decide if its staff has done so
 aisa sabit hone par bank apana daawa tay karegaa or aapako chukaa degaa
 If the bank made a mistake, then the bank would pay the entire money
 agar upabhokta yaa bank main se kisi kii galati nahin hogi, system main kisi gadabadi se aisa hoga to 5000 rupee tak hi chukaaya jayega
 That too will be such a payment once in the whole life
 agar dobaaraa frod ho gaya to paanch hazaar bhi nahin milegaa
 Online banking is the reality today
 iskaa istemaal badhegaa hi lekin iske khatare bhi utane hi hai
 Now you have to understand that if someone lost your money in a moment, would you be able to take it back in a year
 kya aapako pataa he ki kya-kya karnaa he or police or bank kitni udaartaa se aapaki madad karenge
 The banking code is intended to protect banks or consumers in the event of a fraud
 yah sab nae vishay hai, jinke bare main aapako hi nahin, ham patrakaron ko bhi jaanane-samajhane kii zarurat he
 So today we will talk in 'prime time' that without online banking the fault is more on the accountability of the bank, but in online banking the fault is more on the accountability of the consumer
 aisa kyon he or aapako bachane ke liye kya karnaa chahie
 Even after this, we miss

 Two months later, the State Bank of Patiala has received a reply that the people who withdraw money from the ATM of Union Bank of India are not giving complete information
 yani abhi tak log apana paisa hasil nahin kar paae hai
 While lakhs of rupees were extracted from this village by making a clone of the card of half a dozen people

 In the era of electronic bank, the reply comes from the email, but it takes months to recover the money stolen

 aisa kyon he or aapako bachane ke liye kya karnaa chahie
 660 crore was blown from the Central Bank of Bangladesh in February this year
 duniya main ab tak isse bada banking frod nahin hua he
 This money has not been returned yet
 jab bank apana paisa waapas nahin le saktaa he, to aapkaa lutaa gaya paisa kaise degaa
 Will not give so easily
 hamane isiaisiai bank kii niyamavali jaakar padhane kaa prayaas kiya ki aisi sthiti main bank aapse kya vaada karata he
 There is Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI) in India, banks are its members
 isi ke anusaar isiaisiai bank ne vaada kiya he ki kisi frod ke maamle main agar bank maan letaa he ki galati uski yaa uske staff kii he to bank apana daayitv sweekaar karegaa or clem chukaayegaa
 When there is no fault of any branch or consumer in case of fraud, the bank will compensate the loss of the consumer to an extent
 job racket, latary yaa email ke zariye fund transfar jaisaa frod hone par bank tay karegaa ki kya uske staff ne aisa kiya he
 On proving this, the bank will settle its claim and repay you
 bank kii galati hoti hogi, to bank puraa paisa chukaayegaa
 If there is no fault of the consumer or the bank, if something happens in the system, then only Rs 5000 will be paid
 wo bhi puure jivan main is tarah kaa bhugtan ek baar hoga
 If it is fraudulent again, it will not be even five thousand
 online baking aaj kii sachai he
 Its use will increase, but its risks are also similar
 ab aapako samajhnaa yah he ki agar aapkaa paisa pal bhar main kisi ne gaayab kar liya to kya aap use saal bhar main bhi waapas le paayenge
 Do you know what to do and how generously the police and banks will help you
 banking code kisi frod kii sthiti main bainkon ko bachaane ke liye he yaa upabhokta ko
 These are all new topics, about which not only you, we journalists also need to know
 to aaj ham 'prime time' main yahi baat karenge ki bina online baking main galati kii javabdehi bank par zyada hoti he, lekin online baking main galati kii javabdehi upabhokta par zyada hoti he
 Why is this and what should you do to avoid it
 agar dobaaraa frod ho gaya to paanch hazaar bhi nahin milegaa
 Online banking is the reality today
 iskaa istemaal badhegaa hi lekin iske khatare bhi utane hi hai
 Now you have to understand that if someone lost your money in a moment, would you be able to take it back in a year
 kya aapako pataa he ki kya-kya karnaa he or police or bank kitni udaartaa se aapaki madad karenge
 The banking code is intended to protect banks or consumers in the event of a fraud
 yah sab nae vishay hai, jinke bare main aapako hi nahin, ham patrakaron ko bhi jaanane-samajhane kii zarurat he
 So today we will talk in 'prime time' that without online banking the fault is more on the accountability of the bank, but in online banking the fault is more on the accountability of the consumer
 aisa kyon he or aapako bachane ke liye kya karnaa chahie

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in the city of Shyaman, China to participate in the 9th BRICS Conference
 china, bharat, rus, brazil or dakshin africa ke is sammelan kii theme 'bricks- strangar partnership for better future' yani behatar bhavishya ke liye majboot gathjod he
 In this conference to be held in China, where many important issues including the global economy, global economic governance and national security development will be raised, the question is whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President of Russia Vladimir Putin will raise those things on this forum of BRICS Those who pass China exasperatingly
 gauratlab he ki bricks sammelan shuru hone se thik pehle china ne sadsy deshon ko saaf-saaf kaha he ki koi bhi desh is manch se pakistan or islamic aatankwaad kaa mudda nahin uthayega
 This decree of China is about India
 vah nahin chahta ki uske desh main lage is manch se uske mitra desh pakistan par kisi tarah kii koi tippanee kii jaae
 The other important issue is that of North Korea
 bricks sammelan se pehle neuyark times main vladimir putin ke lekh main kaha gaya he ki is sammelan ke dauraan uttar korea maamle main america kii bhoomika par charchaa kii jaaegi
 Significantly, India has a normal relationship with North Korea and till now it has been avoiding speaking anything about North Korea
 lekin rus kii taraf se yadi uttar korea kaa mudda uthaaya jaataa he to dekhne kii baat hogi ki kya bharat is manch se uttar korea par apana rukh saaf karne athwa spasht karne kii koshish karegaa
 Therefore, in this conference, which will run in China for two days, the world will be eyeing this jugalbandi of Prime Minister Modi and President Putin
 yadi modi pakistan or aatankwaad ke mudde par apni baat rakhte hai to jaahir he ki china ko yah raas nahin aayega
 In addition, doing so could have a serious impact on the bilateral talks between the two countries outside the conference
 vahiin yadi putin uttar korea kaa mudda uthaate hai topradhanmantri modi par ek or dabaav padegaaki vah uttar korea par apana rukh spasht karen
 On doing this, it is possible that India's position will not be liked by Donald Trump in the US and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who is visiting India soon

 Till the last breath, i will keep fighting against the hanging forces
 "baat yahaan tak to thik thi lekin lalu yadav ne iske aage yah bhi likh diya ki bijepi ko nae gathbandhan ke saathi mubarak hon
 Was his gesture to the new alliance partner that Nitish Kumar is getting closer to the BJP? When the market of speculation became hot, Lalu Yadav did not come forward but it was clarified by his party that Lalu Yadav meant CBI and other investigating agencies
 lekin party kii taraf se ai is safai se baat khatm nahin hui
 JDU leaders are also understanding that Lalu Yadav is deliberately talking in gestures
 lalu yadav ke bayaan ke bare main puche jane par jediu ke netaa ke si tyaagi ne kaha ki ham to nae saathi kii talash nahin kar rahe hai
 But, in which context Lalu ji can explain why he has said this
 ham to kai avasaron par ancomfortable rahakar bhi is gathbandhan kii umr puri karnaa chaahate hai
 He said that the circumstances under which this alliance was formed were very bad days, homecoming and intolerance were going on
 lekin ke si tyaagi is baat ko chhupate nahin he ki lalu yadav or unke rang-dhang se wo log pareshaan hai
 He said that no activist of any JDU leader Dal United has said a single word against Laloo Yadav till date
 lekin apane netaa ke khilaaf ham lagaataar ashobhaneey shabd sun rahe hai or bardaasht kar rahe hai
 KC Tyagi said that Nitish and Lalu's alliance took place at a time when the situation was very bad and dominated from intolerance to homecoming
 lekin, gathbandhan ke bare main puche jane par ke si tyaagi ne kaha ki apni taraf se jediu kaa gathbandhan ko ant tak nibhaane kii puri koshish karegaa
 Police cannot arrest unmarried couple from hotel
 Unmarried couple has the right to stay in the hotel as per their choice
 If you are staying in a hotel with your girlfriend and the police comes to inquire you, do not panic
 anamarid kapal kaa hotel main ek saath rahanaa koi jurm nahin he
 Therefore, the police have no right to harass or arrest any unmarried couple staying in the hotel
 supreme court ke senior edwocket vinay kumaar garg kaa kahana he ki anamarid kapal ko ek saath hotel main rahane or aapasi sahmati se shaareerik sambandh banane kaa moulik adhikaar he
 However, the condition for this is that both are adults
 supreme court saaf kah chukaa he ki samvidhan ke anuchhed 21 ke tahat mili moulik adhikaar main apni marji se kisi ke saath rahane or shaareerik sambandh banane kaa adhikaar bhi aata he
 For this, it is not necessary to be tied in marriage
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki agar koi kapal bina shaadi ke kisi hotel main ek saath rahete hai, to yah unka moulik adhikaar he
 Senior Advocate Vinay Kumar Garg says that if the police harasses or arrests the unmarried couple during their stay in the hotel, it would be considered a violation of their fundamental rights
 police kii is karrwai ke khilaaf kapal samvidhan ke anuchhed 32 ke tahat sidhe supreme court yaa anuchhed 226 ke tahat sidhe hoicourt kaa darwaja khatkhata saktaa hai
 According to the senior police officers, a complaint can also be made against the policeman who harasses the unmarried couple in the hotel from the Superintendent of Police of the district or above
 iske alaava peedit kapal ke paas maanavadhikaar ayog main shikaayat karne kaa bhi vikalp rahata he
 In response to a question, Senior Advocate Garg said that the hotel cannot stop an unmarried couple from staying on the grounds that the two are not married
 agar hotel aisa karata he, to yah bhi moulik adhikaar kaa hanan mana jayega
 This means that unmarried couples can stay there comfortably by paying the hotel rent
 iske alaava indian hotel indatri kii sheersh sanstha hotel association of india kaa bhi koi aisa niyam nahin he, jo anamarid kapal ko kisi hotel par thaharne se roktaa ho
 Why do police conduct raids in hotels? Police does not conduct raids in hotels to arrest or harass an unmarried couple
 supreme court ke senior edwocket vinay kumaar garg kaa kahana he ki hindustan main veshyavriti aparaadh mana jaataa he
 The police raids the hotel against such prostitution or on the possibility of hiding a criminal
 agar koi anamarid kapal hotel main tehra he or police chhapemari ke dauraan unke paas aati he, to aise kapal ko ghabaraane kii koi jarurat nahin he
 On the demand of the police, such a couple will have to show their ID card i
e
 ID card to prove that both are staying in the hotel by mutual consent and are not involved in any kind of prostitution

 Is this the end of the world? hamaari raajnneeti kab rashtravaadi ho jaati he or kab jativaadee iskaa sambandh is baat se he ki kis rajya main chunaav hone vaale hai
 One and a half years ago, why in the Lok Sabha elections, the hero of One India campaign is now being called the first OBC Prime Minister of the country
 patna main samraat ashok kii jati khojane ke prayaason ke baad agar aap pichley ek saal main bihar main hue jatigat swaabhaamimaan sammelnon kaa ricard nikaalenge to pataa chalegaa ki dal bhale alag alag hon jati ko lekar sabakaa nazariyaa ek hi he
 After all, why is the hero of one Bharat Shrestha Bharat being called OBC Prime Minister these days
 bataane vaale koi or nahin, bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah hai
 In the meeting of Backward Front, he said that BJP has given the highest number of OBC Chief Ministers in the country
 desh kaa pehla obisi pradhanmantri bhi bijepi ne hi diya he
 If the Dalit Morcha had also met, it would have been an opportunity to tell how many Dalits have made the Chief Minister, but on his statement, before Google, Lalu Yadav told that in 1996, as the National President of Janata Dal, he was the name of Deve Gowda Had announced vokkaliga jati ke devegoda hi pehle obisi pradhanmantri hai
 Deve Gowda is also saying that i am the first OBC Prime Minister
 jab tak amit shah devegoda or lalu yadav ke bayaan kaa khandan nahin kar dete tab tak bijepi adhyaksh ke bayaan ke kaaran pehali baar pradhanmantri duusare number par nazar aa rahe hai
 It is also being said that the Prime Minister's caste was included in the list of obcs a few years ago and for the first time in the Lok Sabha elections, he used his caste differently in his speeches
 maharashtra haryana or dilli main chunaav ho gaye lekin pradhanmantri banane ke baad obisi nahin bataaye gaye, bihar ke chunaav main aisa kya he ki bina obisi hue kaam nahin chal rahaa he
 Amit Shah said that only BJP can do welfare of backward, political parties made for the welfare of backward castes have remained confined to their own community
 loksabhaa chunaavon main shah or modi kii jodi ne upi bihar ke obisi netaaon ko na sirf shikast di balki daliton kii sabase badi netaa mayawati ko zero par pahunchaa diya lekin usee jodi par yah aarope kyon lag rahaa he ki jati aadhaarit janaganana kyon saarvajanik nahin ho rahi he
 An interesting analysis on this read in Economic Times
 rajesh ramchandran ne likhaa he ki jab afasaron ne dekha ki is ginati main apper cast khataranaak rup se sankhya main kam hai to unhen laga ki ab to or bhi pramanikta ke saath yah sawaal uthegaa ki jisaki sankhya sabase kam he sarkaar main uski bhagidaari sabase adhik kyon hai
 Rajesh estimates that the report is being suppressed with this fear
 rajesh ne bhi apane lekh main is jaankaree par puri tarah se daawa nahin kiya he lekin unhone ek ganit bataaya he jisase aap is khel ko samaj sakate hai
 The only effective backward cast minister in the Modi cabinet, if any, is Modi himself
 27 sadasyon kii unki cabinet main varchasv apper cast kaa hi he
 8 cabinet ministers are Brahmins and four are Kshatriyas
 1 When the whole game is on it then why not set the rules of the game in a transparent manner
 kya bijepi isliye dar rahi he ki is report ke baad sarkaar par shiksha or naukariyon main obisi aarakshan kota badhaane kaa dabaav badhegaa jabaki bijepi or sangh parivaar ke samarthakon kaa ek bada hissaa yah ummid rakhata he ki obisi pradhanmantri aarakshan samaapt kar denge
 By the way, BJP has always been a supporter of reservation
 aakhir kyon lalu yadav or nitish kumaar jati aadhaarit janaganana kii report saarvajanik karne kii maang par khub jor de rahe hai
 Lalu Yadav marched till Raj Bhavan in Patna and said that Prime Minister Modi is an enemy of the backward cast
 agar ve hitaishi hai to jati janaganana kii report saarvajanik karke dikhaayen
 Nitish Kumar said in Delhi that when the survey was done, the calculation should be done and the people should know about the number and the different groups of the society, about their economic status, social status Should be found
 bijepi kii taraf se batting karte hue ramvilas paswan ne kaha ki kal publish ho jayega to kal hi kya ho jayega
 As we will do from our time, a condition of caste census was that it would not be published
 kya paswan sahi bol rahe hai
 There is no condition in my knowledge that the census of caste will not be made public
 2010 main jati aadhaarit janaganana ko lekar kaaphi bahes hui thi
 After 1931, even though caste was not counted, it was said that the 1980 Mandal Commission revealed that there are 54 per cent obcs in the country, around 30 per cent Scheduled Castes and Tribes and 16 to 18 per cent Upper Castes
 agar apper cast kaa anupaat das pratishat se bhi kam hua to pratinidhitiv ke sawaal ko lekar bhartiya raajnneeti main phir se bhuuchaal aa saktaa he
 According to the report at that time, Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj were in favor of caste-based census
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh iske paksh main nahin tha
 In the same way, Chidambaram, Anand Sharma were in opposition in the Congress and Veerappa Moily Vayalar in favor of Ravi

 It turned out that India is still a rural nation
 iske saadhe choubees karod pariwaron main se kareeb atharah karod parivaar gaanvon main rahete hai
 But when the number of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was reported in this survey, why were the others not told
 jab bijepi pradhanmantri kii jati bataa sakati he to jati kii ginati kyon nahin
 There is no one else to tell, BJP national president is Amit Shah
 pichhadaa morcha kii baithak main unhone kaha ki bijepi ne desh main sabase adhik obisi mukhyamantri diye hai
 BJP is also the first OBC Prime Minister of the country
 agar dalit morcha kii bhi baithak hoti to yah bhi bataane kaa mauka miltaa ki kitne dalit mukhyamantri banaae hai lekin khayr unke is bayaan par google se pehle lalu yadav ne bataa diya ki 1996 main janata dal ke rashtriya adhyaksh ke naate unhone hi devegoda ke naam kaa elaan kiya tha
 Deve Gowda of Vokkaliga caste is the first OBC Prime Minister
 devegoda bhi bol rahe hai ki main hum pehla obisi pradhanmantri
 Until Amit Shah refutes the statements of Deve Gowda and Lalu Yadav, the Prime Minister is seen second on the first time due to the statement of the BJP President
 yah bhi kaha jane laga he ki pradhanmantri kii bhi jati kuch saal pehle obisi kii suchi main shaamil kii gai or loksabhaa chunaavon main unhone pehali baar apane bhaashanon main apni jati kaa alag-alag tareeke se istamaal kiya
 Elections were held in Maharashtra, Haryana and Delhi, but after becoming Prime Minister, OBC was not told, what is it in Bihar elections that work is not going on without OBC
 amit shah ne kaha ki sirf bijepi hi pichhadon kaa kalyaan kar sakati he, pichhadi jati ke kalyaan ke liye bane raajnneetik dal apane hi samudaay tak simat kar rah gaye hai
 In the Lok Sabha elections, the Shah and Modi duo not only defeated the OBC leaders of UP Bihar but also pushed the biggest Dalit leader, Mayawati, to zero, but why the same pair is facing allegations that caste based census is not going public

 pataa chalaa ki bharat aaj bhi ek gramin raashtra he
 Out of its twenty five and twenty five crore families, about eighteen crore families live in villages
 lekin jab is survey main anusuchit jati janajati kii sankhya bataa di to baakiyon kii kyon nahin bataai gai
 When BJP can tell the Prime Minister's caste then why not the caste count
 modi cabinet main ekmaatr asardaar becoward cast mantri agar koi he to khud modi hi hai
 The upper cast in his cabinet of 27 members is of the upper cast
 8 cabinet mantri brahman hai or chaar kshatriya hai1 jab sara khel isi par he to khel ke niyam paardarshee tareeke se kyon na tay kiye jaaen
 Is the BJP afraid that after this report, there will be increasing pressure on the government to increase the OBC reservation quota in education and jobs, while a large section of BJP and Sangh Parivar supporters hope that the OBC Prime Minister will abolish the reservation
 vaise bijepi hameshaa hi aarakshan samarthak rahi he
 After all, why are Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar stressing the demand to make the caste-based census report public
 lalu yadav ne patna main rajbhavan tak march kiya or kaha ki pradhanmantri modi becoward cast ke dushman hai
 If they are friendly then show the report of caste census in public
 nitish kumaar ne dilli main kaha jab surveykshan karaayaa gaya, gananaa karai gai to uski report aani chahie or logon ko sankhya ke bare main maaloom hona chahie or samaaj ke jo vibhinn samooh hai, unki aarthik sthiti ke bare main, saamaajik sthiti ke bare main jaankaree milani chahie
 Batting on behalf of the BJP, Ram Vilas Paswan said that what will happen tomorrow if it will be published tomorrow
 ham apane samay se karenge, vaise jati kii janaganana kii ek shart yah bhi thi ki ise publish nahin kiya jayega
 Is Paswan right? meri jaankaree main aisi koi shart nahin he ki jati kii janaganana saarvajanik nahin kii jaaegi
 In 2010, there was a lot of debate about caste-based census
 1931 ke baad bhale hi jati kii ginati nahin hui lekin kaha gaya ki 1980 ke mandal kamishan se motaa moti maaloom chal gaya tha ki desh main 54 pratishat obisi hai, 30 pratishat ke aas paas anusuchit jati or janajati or 16 se 18 pratishat apper cast
 If the ratio of upper cast is less than ten percent, then there can be a stir again in Indian politics regarding the question of representation

 aakhir kyon lalu yadav or nitish kumaar jati aadhaarit janaganana kii report saarvajanik karne kii maang par khub jor de rahe hai
 Lalu Yadav marched till Raj Bhavan in Patna and said that Prime Minister Modi is an enemy of the backward cast
 agar ve hitaishi hai to jati janaganana kii report saarvajanik karke dikhaayen
 Nitish Kumar said in Delhi that when the survey was done, the calculation should be done and the people should know about the number and the different groups of the society, about their economic status, social status Should be found
 bijepi kii taraf se batting karte hue ramvilas paswan ne kaha ki kal publish ho jayega to kal hi kya ho jayega
 As we will do from our time, a condition of caste census was that it would not be published
 kya paswan sahi bol rahe hai
 There is no condition in my knowledge that the census of caste will not be made public
 2010 main jati aadhaarit janaganana ko lekar kaaphi bahes hui thi
 After 1931, even though caste was not counted, it was said that the 1980 Mandal Commission revealed that there are 54 per cent obcs in the country, around 30 per cent Scheduled Castes and Tribes and 16 to 18 per cent Upper Castes
 agar apper cast kaa anupaat das pratishat se bhi kam hua to pratinidhitiv ke sawaal ko lekar bhartiya raajnneeti main phir se bhuuchaal aa saktaa he
 According to the report at that time, Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj were in favor of caste-based census
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh iske paksh main nahin tha
 In the same way in Congress, Chidambaram, Anand Sharma were in Viro and Veerappa Moily Vayalar in Ravi's favor
 left, mulaayam singh yadav, lalu prasad yadav or khaskar sharad yadav ne kaaphi sakriy bhoomika nibhaai thi

 It turned out that India is still a rural nation

 '' sharada begum kahati hai
 The 67-year-old woman, a member of one of the 100 families of West Delhi's rehabilitation colony Raghubir Nagar, had agreed to participate in a pilot project aimed at bringing about a radical change in the public distribution system
 2011 ke dauraan in pariwaron ko uchit mulya kii dukaan par sasti dar par milane vaale chaaval, gehun, chini or kerosine kii jagah har maah 1,000 ru
 Transferred to a female member's bank account
 sanyukt raashtra vikaas kaarykram (yuandipi) kii aarthik sahaayta se chalane vaale dilli sarkaar ke is project kaa uddeshy garibi rekha se neeche rahane vaale logon ko khaadya sabsidi sidhe dene kii vyaavhaarikta kaa pareekshan karnaa he
 All the beneficiaries of Raghubir Nagar have BPL (below Poverty Line) card, its other objective was to fix the public distribution system (PDS), known for corruption
 yah yojana dakshin america main chalane vaali ek yojana se prerit he, khaskar brazil ke bolsa familia kaarykram se jo kaaphi safal rahaa he
 a similar 'cash transfer' scheme has also been tested in other parts of the country in the last decade, especially the central government-funded Dhanalakshmi program which has been implemented in more than half a dozen states since 2008-09
 iske tahat aise pariwaron ko nakadi di jaati he jo apni betiyon kii acchhee tarah se dekhbhaal karte hai
 There has also been a lot of discussion of a scheme of the Bihar government, under which high school students are given money to buy bicycles
 lekin raghubir nagar kii yah yojana kisi shahari kshetra main peedies kii vastuon kii jagah nakadi dene kaa pehla prayaas he
 There is no doubt that the PDS system is faltering in many parts of the country

 vadhava samiti kii 2009 kii report main kaha gaya he ki isamen ''bade paimaane par bhrashtachar he jo anaaj ke kahin or bheje jane or licage kii vajah se he
 According to Planning Commission estimates, 58 percent of subsidized foodgrains do not reach the real beneficiaries
 raghubir nagar ke in bashindon ko bhi isi tarah kii samasya kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Sharada Begum complains that she never got a quota of 25 kg of subsidized food grains and five kg of sugar every month
 ve kahati hai, ''agar ham puri tarah uchit mulya vaali rashan kii dukaanon par nirbhar rahen to hamen khaane ke laale pad jaaenge
 "she is very happy with the cash transfer scheme and wants it to never be discontinued
" unke pati 71 saal ke abdul jabbaar biimaar hai
 She says, "if this scheme continues, we can buy good quality food grains and other food items from the market
 baaki bache paise se main apane shuhar ke liye dawaaen kharid sakuungi
 "other beneficiaries have a similar opinion

 "similarly, 64-year-old Leela says," It helped us a lot, but the amount was Rs 1,500
 prati maah honi chahie
 "many state governments have seen the advantages of the new approach adopted to achieve the old goal
" bihar ke up-mukhyamantri susheel ku maar modi kehete hai, ''nakadi transfar yojana kii hamaari saf lata se pataa chalaa ki isse bhrashtachar main baari kami aati he
 Delhi government is going to start three more pilot projects soon
 khamiyaan bhi kam nahilekin yah puri tasviir nahin he
 Sharada and Anjana have at least a pucca house, Reshma, 35, lives in a slum in Raghubir Nagar
 lekin unhen is yojana kaa phayda dene se manaa kar diya gaya
 She expresses the apprehension that planners and social activists who oppose cash transfers have often expressed
 ve kahati hai, ''isse jo paisa milegaa vah khaane kii jagah duusari chizon par kharch ho jayega
 We do not need cash
 ''sthaneey nivasee jagadish bharti kehete hai, ''mard is paise ko jhpat lenge or daaru pine tathaa jua khilne main lagaayenge
 Women cannot do anything special
 bachche bhukhe hi rahenge
 "it is also feared that if the money is not increased, then we will not be able to get the full ration in the era of inflation
 yadi nakadi transfar ko peedies kii jagah lagu kar diya jaataa he to iske desh kii arthvyavastha ke liye bhi bade nihitarth honge
 What will happen to the PDS that has been in existence for decades? And what will the government do to the mountain of food grains purchased every year? For example, 2 in the year 2011-12
 83 karod ton gehun kii kharid kii gai jisamen se 80 fisadi ko peedies ke jariye vitarit kiya gaya
 If the government stops buying every year at the minimum support price (MSP), then the prices of food grains will fall, which will kill the farmers

 We will roll back ship-to-mouth (ship to consumer) arrangements, becoming dependent on imports
 '' unhone kaha ki isse kheti ke baad storage jaise buniyadi dhaanche main nivesh par bhi maar padegi
 Perhaps the best solution is to mix cash transfer and traditional PDS
 jaisaa ki tamilnadu or chhattisgarh main dekha gaya he, peedies main sudhaar kiya ja saktaa he or yadi ichhashakti ho to ise prabhavi tareeke se chalaaya bhi ja saktaa he

 On the question of respect for Dalits and Bhim Rao Ambedkar, Tejashwi Yadav said that the entire politics of Modi ji is showy, adulterated and artificial

 supreme court ne iskar ritern daakhil na karne ke 20 saal puraane maamle main tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri jayalalita ko aropamukt karne se inkaar kar diya
 The court rejected Jayalalithaa's request and allowed the lower court to proceed against her

 Income tax officials had filed criminal cases against Jayalalithaa and her close aide Sasikala in 1996 and 1997

 Taking a dig at the Congress, Ram Vilas Paswan asked the question that when the Congress won the elections conducted by evms in Punjab, then why did they not raise the question of beating the evms? Paswan further attacked the Congress and questioned that The UPA had been in power for 10 years at the center and the election of that government was also done through EVM machine, so at that time Congress objected to EVM Why not lodged? Paswan said that doing Aknishpaksh and constitutional Snsthaka offenses such as the Congress of the propaganda of the so-called manipulation of evms Election Commission

 President Pranab Mukherjee on Tuesday night approved the recommendation of the Union Cabinet to impose President's rule in Arunachal Pradesh and with this, the state came under President's rule amid a political uproar for more than a month
 maamla ucchtam nyaayalay main lambit hone ke dauraan uthaae gaye is kadam kii congress or anya dalon ne tikhi aalochana kii or ise loktantr kii ‘hatya’ qaraar diya
 President Pranab Mukherjee today approved the recommendation of the Union Cabinet after extensive deliberations over the last two days and accepted the premise that the state is in a 'constitutional crisis'
 raashtrapati ne kal grih mantri rajnath singh ko bulaayaa tha or rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagu karne kii jarurat ke bare main kuch sawaal puche the
 It seems that the President was satisfied with the government's idea that the constitutional system has collapsed after political instability in the state
 grih mantralay ne ek bayaan main kaha ki arunachal pradesh ke rajyapal kii report ke anusaar rajya main paidaa hue sanvaidhanik sankat par sangyaan lete hue kendriya cabinet ne 24 janvari 2016 ko apni baithak main raashtrapati se aisi udghoshnaa jari karne kaa anurodh kiya tha
 It states that the President has signed a proclamation to impose President's rule in Arunachal Pradesh under Article 356 (1) of the Constitution
 yah udghoshnaa aaj se prabhavi hogi or pradesh kii vidhansabha nilambit rahegi
 The proclamation was signed two days after the President recommended the cabinet
 cabinet ne ravivaar ko huyi vishesh baithak main rajya main kendriya shashan lagu kiye jane kii sifarish kii thi
 Union Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju had said that the cabinet was bound to take the decision as a constitutional crisis arose and the six-month period was completed between the two sessions of the state assembly
 pradesh main raashtrapati shashan lagaae jane kii tikhi aalochana karte hue congress, jadyu, bhakpa or aap ne ise sanghavaad or loktantr kii ‘hatya’ qaraar diya or bhaajapa nit centre sarkaar par desh kii sarvocch adaalat ko ‘apamaanit’ karne kaa aarope lagaaya jo abhi maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi he
 Congress's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said in a series of tweets, "the sun rises in the east of the country
" haalanki bhaajapa ne samvidhan ke mulyon ko arunachal main raashtrapati shashan lagu kar grahan laga diya
 Modi ji crushed federalism
 ’ unhone twit kiya ‘ganatantr ke sansthaapak loktantric evam sanghavaad sambandhi siddhanton ko modiji ne ganatantr diwas par swaha kar diya
 We will fight against it
 ’tippaniyan The BJP, however, defended the decision, saying that it needed to be looked at from several perspectives and it was in line with constitutional obligations
 iske saath hi party ne congress par mudde kaa raajnneetikaran karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Congress spokesman Tom Vadakkan said, 'this is a murder of democracy
 
 
 maamla adaalat main he or sarkaar ne jaldbaaji main karrwai kii he
 This is clearly an insult to the Supreme Court of the country
 loktantr kii hatya kii gayi he
 ' dilli ke mukhyamantri aravind kejariwal ne raashtrapati shashan lagaae jane kii tulana apatkaal jaisi sthiti se kii
 He tweeted, 'president's rule in Arunachal, Advaniji was right in saying that there are situations like Emergency in the country
 ’’ mukherjee ne kal grih mantri rajnath singh ko bulaayaa tha or raashtrapati shashan lagaae jane kii aavashyaktaa ke bare main unase kuch sawaal kiye the
 At the same time, the ruling Congress party in the state also met him and opposed the cabinet decision
 raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne pichley do dinon main gahan vichaar vimarsh ke baad aaj kendriya cabinet kii sifarish ko manjuuri pradaan kar di or is aadhaar ko sweekaar kar liya ki rajya main ‘sanvaidhanik sankat’ he
 The President yesterday summoned Home Minister Rajnath Singh and asked some questions about the need to implement President's rule in the state
 aisa lagata he ki raashtrapati sarkaar ke is vichaar se santusht ho gaye ki rajya main raajnneetik asthirataa ke baad sanvaidhanik vyavastha charmara gai he
 The Home Ministry said in a statement that according to the report of the Governor of Arunachal Pradesh, taking cognizance of the constitutional crisis in the state, the Union Cabinet in its meeting on 24 January 2016 requested the President to issue such a proclamation
 isamen kaha gaya he ki raashtrapati ne samvidhan ke anuchhed 356 (1) ke tahat arunachal pradesh main raashtrapati shashan lagaae jane sambandhi udghoshnaa par hastakshar kar die hai
 This announcement will be effective from today and the state assembly will remain suspended
 raashtrapati ne cabinet kii sifarish ke do dinon baad is udghoshnaa par hastakshar kiye

 Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has made an interesting statement related to demonetisation
 unhone kaha ki unhen centre sarkaar ke notebandi ke kadam kii koi jaankaree nahin thi or yahi kaaran he ki unhen to khud note badalawaane ke liye america se bharat waapas aana padaa tha
 In an event organized in connection with his book, he stated that he had never been in favor of demonetisation because he believed that the immediate cost of demonetisation would outweigh its long-term benefits
 gauratlab he ki governor pad par rajan kaa teen saal kaa kaarykaal chaar sitambar 2016 ko puraa ho gaya
 The government announced demonetisation on 8 November 2016, under which the existing notes of 500 and 1000 rupees were removed from circulation
 rajan ne kaha ki jidipi vruddhi ko bal dene ke liye bharat ko teen kshetron buniyadi dhaancha, bijli va niryaat par dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie
 Rajan wants to become governor again
 Earlier, in an interview given to India Today, Raghuram Rajan insisted that 'make in India' should not only be 'make for India'
 saath hi unhone kaha ki vah dobaaraa arabiai garvanar banane kii bhi manshaa rakhte hai
 Demonetisation had an impact on GDP
 Rajan said in the interview that there was a 1-2 per cent decline in GDP due to demonetisation
 arabiai ko notebandi kaa bhaar jhelana padaa
 The burden of printing new notes overshadowed the benefits of these schemes
 unhone kaha ki agar jepi morgan jaisi sansthaaon ke aankalan par bharosa karen to notebandi kii vajah se 1-2 pratishat jidipi ke baraabar nuksaan hua he, jo ki lagbhag 2 lakh karod ke aasapaas he
 On the other hand, only about 10 thousand crores was earned from tax
 vahiin unhone kaha arabiai ke paas note print karne kaa adhikaar isliye he kyonki agar sarkaar khud apane paise print karne lage to bharat bhi zimbabwe ban saktaa he
 This is the reason why an independent institution like RBI is needed

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special news letter babari vidhwans cese main laalkrishna adwani, murali manohar joshi or uma bharti jaise netaaon par aarope tay hone ke mahaj 24 ghante baad buudhvaar ko uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ayodhya ke daure par pahunche hai
 This is CM Yogi's first visit to Ayodhya after becoming the Chief Minister nearly two months ago
 vahaan pahunchane ke baad sabase pehle unhone hanumangadhi ke darshan kiye or puja-archana kii
 After this he went to see Ramlala
 vahaan se sarayu nadi ke tat par aachman ke liye gaye or vahaan ghaaton kaa nirikshan kiya
 The comments vaise mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lene ke baad unka ayodhya janaa tay tha lekin babari vidhwans cese main bijepi ke varisht netaaon par aarope tay hone ke tatkaal baad vahaan achaanak jane ke faisle ke siyaasi nihitarth nikaale ja rahe hai
 This is also important because CM Yogi Adityanath had also met these senior BJP leaders who had come to the court for the hearing
 darasal jaankaron ke mutabik siem yogi kii is yatra ke jariye aisa lagata he ki bijepi yah sandesh dena chaahati he ki ram mandir kaa mudda uske liye abhi bhi ahm he or vah uske agenda main shaamil he
 Whatever the reason may be, but the timing of this journey has created political turmoil
 15 saalon main pehali baar pradesh ke mukhyamantri ke ayodhya daure ko dekhte hue faijabad jile main jabardast suraksha intjaam kiye gaye hai
 Earlier in 2002, the then Chief Minister Rajnath Singh visited Ayodhya
 siem yogi takreeban nau ghante ayodhya main rahenge or vah dow
 Ram Manohar Lohia will also hold discussions with party officials at Awadh University
 iske alaava prashasnic adhikariyon sang samiksha baithak karenge or shaam ko mahant nrity gopaldaas ke janmotsav kaarykram main shaamil honge
 By the way, it is being said from the party that he was already invited to the Mahant dance Gopaldas' birthday celebrations and he was already scheduled to go there
 isliye is daure ke siyaasi nihitarth nahin nikaale jane chahie kyonki yah mahaj ittefaq he ki babari cese kii sunwaayee ke agle hi din mahant nrity gopaldaas kaa janmdin pad gaya
 Though he was scheduled to go to Ayodhya after taking oath of the Chief Minister's post, but the political implications of the sudden decision to leave there soon after the charges were framed on the senior leaders of the BJP in the Babri demolition case are being removed
 yah isliye bhi ahm he kyonki court main sunwaayee ke liye hajir hone ke liye pahunche bijepi ke in varisht netaaon se siem yogi adityanath ne mulaakaat bhi kii thi
 In fact, according to experts, through this visit of CM Yogi, it seems that the BJP wants to give the message that the Ram temple issue is still important for him and he is included in his agenda
 vajah chaahe jo bhi ho lekin is yatra kii timming ne siyaasi khalabali jarur machaa di he
 For the first time in 15 years, tremendous security arrangements have been made in Faizabad district in view of the Chief Minister's visit to Ayodhya
 isse pehle 2002 main tatkaaleen mukhyamantri rajnath singh ayodhya gaye the
 CM Yogi will be in Ayodhya for almost nine hours and he will be Dr
 ram manohar lohia avadh vishvavidhyalay main party ke padaadhikariyon se vichaar-vimarsh bhi karenge
 Apart from this, a review meeting will be held with administrative officials and in the evening Mahant Nritya will participate in the birth anniversary program of Gopaldas
 vaise party kii taraf se yah kaha ja rahaa he ki mahant nrity gopaldaas ke janmotsav kaarykram main unako pehle hi aamantrit kiya gaya tha or unka vahaan jane kaa pehle se hi kaarykram tha
 Therefore, the political implications of this visit should not be removed as it is a mere coincidence that the very next day of hearing of the Babri case, Mahanta dance Gopaldas had his birthday
 15 saalon main pehali baar pradesh ke mukhyamantri ke ayodhya daure ko dekhte hue faijabad jile main jabardast suraksha intjaam kiye gaye hai

 a post shared by Painkiller (@kill_ur_pains) on Feb 8, 2018 at 7:37 pm PST abhinetri se netaa baniin jaya pradaa or samaajawaadee party ke varisht netaa ajam khan ke bich khinchataan aksar saarvajanik manchon se saamne aati rahi he
 Despite being in the same party, the two leaders continue to accuse each other severely
 is bich jaya pradaa ne ajam khan ko lekar ek or tippanee kii he
 This time he resorted to the film Padmavat to comment on Azam Khan
 jaya pradaa ne kaha he ki jab main padmavat film dekh rahi thi, to khilji ke kirdaar ne mujhe ajam khan kii yaad dilaai
 He said that i remembered seeing Khilji how Azam Khan had harassed me during the elections
 donon ke bich lanbaa vivadadrasal, jaya pradaa amar singh kii kareebi maani jaati hai or ajam khan se unka vivaad kaaphi lanbaa he
 The reason for this is Jaya Prada contesting from Rampur, Azam Khan's hometown
 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main samaajawaadee party ne jaya pradaa ko tikat diya or wo chunaav jeet gayi
 Jaya Prada made many allegations against Azam Khan for this election
 yahaan tak ki ajam khan par jaya pradaa ko chunaav haraane ke bhi aarope lage
 However, Jaya Prada won the election
 iske baad 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi jaya pradaa ne rampur se chunaav ladaa orajam khanper phir unke virodh ke aarope lage
 Once again Jaya Prada won the election
 sirf chunaav haraane kii koshish tak hi jaya pradaa ke aarope simit nahin rahe hai
 He has also made many serious allegations against Azam Khan
 vahiin duusari taraf ajam khan bhi saarvajanik manchon se jaya pradaa ko lekar vivaadit tippanee karte rahe hai
 In such a situation, when Jaya Prada is being questioned about going with BJP or any other party, he has once again targeted his old rival Azam Khan
