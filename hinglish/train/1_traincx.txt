 If the government changes, then the attitude of the great men of the country also changes
 sattarudh sarkarein apane pratik purushon ko mahatv detii hai to vipaksh ke netaa hamalavar bhi ho jate hai
 The previous Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Rajasthan, while changing schooling courses, called Veer Savarkar a great revolutionary and a warrior of freedom struggle
 satta main ai congress sarkaar ne paathyakram main tabdili karte hue vir saavarkar ke paathyakram main jod diya he ki angrejon kii yaatnaaon se tang aakar saavarkar chaar baar maafee maang kar jail se baahar aae the
 In Rajasthan, part-iii syllabus of class x is taught about biographies of great men of the country
 pichhali bijepi sarkaar ne mahapurushon ke chapter se pratham pradhanmantri pandit jawaharlal nehru ko hi gaayab kar diya tha
 Also, a chapter was written on Veer Savarkar, in which he was described as a great freedom fighter
 vir saavarkar ke jeevani ko mahaan krantikari ke rup main likhaa gaya tha
 As soon as the Congress came to power, it was announced that the curriculum changed by the BJP government would be reviewed
 samiksha ke baad ab nayaa paathyakram taiyaar kiya gaya he
 The new books being distributed to the students have once again been added to the biography of Veer Savarkar that the Cellular Jail was so fed up with the British torture that Savarkar apologized to the British 4 times
 baad main unke saath kaam karne ke liye taiyaar bhi ho gaye the

 The government does not intervene in terms of curriculum
 udhar, congress vahi purana tark de rahi he, jo pichhali baar paathyakram main tabdili karne par bijepi sarkaar tark detii thi
 However, there was neither confidence in the government's cleanliness nor trust anymore and the matter has been divided on the level of ideology of academics there too

 In view of the danger of T20 cricket for Test matches, former India batsman VVS Laxman said that in five-day cricket, new experiments like day and night matches are needed
 test cricket ke bhavishya ko lekar chintit lakshmana ne test cricket main din-raat ke match shuru karne or tii-20 kaa chaska paalane vaale yuvaaon ko inhen dekhne ke liye stadium laane kii pairvi kii
 He said in the Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi Memorial Lecture organized by BCCI, the existence of Test cricket is very important for the future of cricket
 prashaskon ke liye yah sabase badi chintaa honi chahie
 We do not know whether the day-night test will meet the technical requirements or not, but due to the newness, the audience will definitely come to see it
 unhone kareeb aadhe ghante ke bhaashan main kaha, dinabhar ke kaam ke baad log maidan par aaenge or kuch ghante khel kaa majaa lenge
 Who knows if this will rekindle interest in Test cricket
 unhone kaha, dudhia roshni main paanch din test cricket un sthanon par karana acchhee pahal hogi jahaan behad garmi or kam os girti he
 Laxman admitted that interest in Test cricket has diminished a lot these days
 unhone kaha, khaali padi ddeerghaaon ke saamne khilne main koi majaa nahin he
 One has to find ways to save Test cricket
 lakshmana ne yah bhi kaha ki unhen tii20 cricket bhi pasand he
 He said, T20 cricket has opened many dimensions
 darshakon ko teen ghante main manoranjan kii guarantee rahati he, cinema kii tarah
 We have to find a way that both formats can coexist
 unhone kaha, puraane khyaalon kaa hone ke baavjood mujhe tii20 cricket bahut pasand he
 i loved playing T20 cricket
 yah aapako alag tareeke se sochane par majaboor karata he
 Laxman also expressed respect for the late Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi
 unhone kaha, bhartiya cricket ke purodhaon main shumaar sabase yuva test captain kii smriti main vyaakhyaan dekar mujhe bahut acha lag rahaa he
 Apart from his countless achievements, he was the first superstar of Indian cricket, well ahead of his time

 akelaa bolne vaala kamazor se kamazor vakt main, taqatvar se taqatvar sarkaar ke saamne ek ummid hota he
 If governments were always with the people, then hundreds of protests against different governments would not have been going on in this India country at the same time
 sarkaar chunate to aap hai magar wo hameshaa aapaki nahin hoti he
 It is not necessary to have matriculation to know this
 isiilie ham paanch saal ke baad sarkaar badal dete hai yaa badalane kaa intazaar karte hai
 In order to save their land in this country, people have had to shoot with the governments
 sarkaron ne apane nagarikon ko jhuthe mukademon main fansaa kar aatankwaadi bana diya or bees bees saal jail main sada diya
 The whole history is replete with fresh morale of protest
 har daur main koi virdohi aata he jo us daur ko ek nayaa mukaam detaa he
 Political parties are not the only ones opposing
 sattadhari dal ke log jab virodh karte hai to unhen har tarah kii suvidha hasil hoti he
 The police supports them
 sarkaar saath detii he
 There are some challenges for the opposing party but they also have strength
 yah suvidha tamaam karmchaaree sanghathan, kisaan mazdoor or peshewar sanghathan ko hasil nahin hoti he
 All kinds of organization are required for protest
 har masale par raajnneetik dal ke log virodh nahin karte hai
 For example, if you tell ABVP and NSUI that you will protest against unemployment and expensive education in capitals across the country, then they will start doing Kathak
 kyonki jahaan ve awaz uthaayenge, mumkin he vahaan unki party kii sarkaar ho sakati he
 Go to Jantar Mantar in Delhi
 rajyon kii rajdhani se lekar zila mukhyalayon par jaakar dekhiye
 Under what circumstances are people protesting against their demand? in sabamein uskaa virodh sabase bada hota he jo akele awaz uthaata he
 As long as someone is the only one to raise a voice, there is still hope that there is someone
 yah baat chup rahane vaale yaa dekhakar andekha karne vaale tabhi samajhate hai jab wo kahin sarkaar or samaaj kii hinsa ke shikaar hote hai or kisi netaa yaa reporter ko phone karte hai
 Gurmehar Kaur's opposition was so great that she did not form an organization to speak out
 uskaa virodh isliye bada ho gaya jab uski awaz par centre sarkaar ke mantri ne pratikriya di
 Kiran Rijiju, the Minister of State for Home, should have encouraged Gurmehar Kaur from the rule, but he made a comment against her and turned the entire government against her
 isliye gurmeher cor kaa virodh bada he
 Gurmehar Kaur had protested that she is not afraid of ABVP
 usne akele jab bolaa to soshal media kii kamazor duniya daud padi ki koi to bolaa
 Probably went viral and then Gurmehar Kaur was targeted
 abivipi kii aalochana to sabane kii or abivipi ne bhi dat kar jawaab diya magar ek ladki kaa akele bolne se ki wo abivipi se nahin darati he, isse dar to paidaa hua
 The matter disappeared in a moment and was brought to light by a year-old video, which Gurmehar Kaur had put on youtube on another reference
 ab us video ke sahare us par hamalaa hua
 The Minister of State for Home joined the attack
 bijepi ke saansad ne kaha ki daaud ibrahim ne bhi apane anti neshnal ko sahi tehraane ke liye baap ke sipaahi hone kaa istamaal nahin kiya
 Apparently Gurmehar's loneliness increased and his courage too
 gandhi kaa sabase bada yogadan kya tha
 He freed the common people from the fear that armed with sticks and could resist the British rule, which had been in existence for 200 years
 bina dare
 Whatever comes out of this basic fear, the society and the government get scared
 aap twitor par jaakar dekhiye, gurmeher ke khilaaf kis bhashaa kaa istamaal kiya gaya he
 This is because some girl kept silent after seeing the government police
 bole nahin
 But the girl turned out to be a bit stubborn and said that she is not afraid
 ab usne kaha he ki use jitna awaz uthaanaa tha uthaa liya, ab wo chup rahegi
 What has been said is correct
 wo dari nahin he, usne ab aap par daal diya he ki aap ek akeli ladki ke saath khadey ho sakate hai to khadey hokar dikhaaiye
 There are some Ram sahibs who are against the war between India and Pakistan
 shanti ko protsaahit karte hai
 They put such messages in youtube
 28 april 2016 ko unheen ke liye gurmeher ne hindi or angrezi main ye video daalaa tha
 Gurmehar Kaur is telling in this video that when she was two years old, her father was martyred, when she was six years old, she even tried to kill a burqewali because she thought she was the one responsible for my father's death
 tab uski maa ne samajhaayaa ki pakistan ne nahin mere pita ko jang ne maaraa he
 He wrote that he learned to forget hatred
 yah aasaan nahin tha lekin bahut mushkil bhi nahin
 If i can do it, you can too
 aaj main bhi apane pita kii tarah hi ek sainik hum
 i fight for peace between India and Pakistan because if there had not been a war, my father would have been with me today
 duniya yuddh ke kilaaf bolti he
 Everyone knows that war is the enemy of humanity so that's why leaders from smallpox to big talk talk about peace
 gurmeher ne jab yah video you tub par daalaa to uskaa saath pakistan ke ek noujvaan faiyaaz khan ne diya
 Till now you must have heard the allied country, the enemy country, Fayyaz Khan introduced the idea of a new country with Gurmehar Kaur
 sibling desh yani bhai bahan kaa desh
 This is why we come to life thinking new and beautiful
 australia main rahete hai faiyaaz khan
 On 6 May 2016, this video was uploaded to youtube
 koi ram sahab hai jo bharat pakistan ke bich shanti ko protsaahit karne ke liye you tub par andolan chalaate hai
 In the same video, Fayaz says
 
 
 hai gurmeher cor, main fayaaz khan hum pakistan se
 When i first came to Australia, i used to see all Indians as i was taught in school
 lekin jaldi hi humlog class room main khaanaa, kursiyaan saajha karne lage jaise ham kareebi dost hon
 We all regret the death of your father in the Kargil war
 maine yuddh dekha he, apane shahar swat main mautein dekhi hai lekin kismat se apane ghar ke kisi sadsy ko nahin khoyaa, lekin mere aasapaas hazaron gurmeher cor hai
 i want to come to India without any visa restriction
 ham donon in paabandiyon ke kilaaf mil kar ladenge
 Thousands of people on both sides of the border do not have to go through the hardships like Gurmehar Kaur, we will fight for it
 main tumhen tumhaare pita kaa pyaar to nahin de saktaa, lekin beshak tumhen dushman desh se ek bhai mil gaya he
 Let's create a unique relationship in this world where the brother is a Muslim and the sister a Sikh
 ab is dushman desh shabd ko sibling desh se badal dete hai
 That means, let's do siblings' country
 ye asar hua tha gurmeher ke video kaa
 There are many videos coming against Gurmehar Kaur's video as well
 unki aalochana bhi ho rahi he
 Our focus is on what happens when a single girl speaks
 aap twitor par jaakar gurmeher cor ko di gai gaaliyon ko jamaa kiijie
 In the name of Nari Devi Hai, the society of the gimmick will open
 mul baat kya he, gurmeher cor ne video daalaa ki wo abivipi se nahin darati he
 But to shore it up, a year old video was taken out and presented as if it is shortening the sacrifices of the soldiers killed while fighting against Pakistan
 apane pita kaa istemaal kar rahi he
 The seekers may have found the same video on the same youtube, but they did not spread it to you, because the effort is to keep on cracking in the name of nationalism
 apane andar hinsa kii bhaavana ko mauka dete rahen
 What Gurmehar's post has achieved has not been achieved anywhere in the world even with thousands of missiles
 sibling desh
 Country of siblings
 hamane shahid shabd kaa istemaal nahin kiya
 We do not
 aap puuchhiye ki ham shahid kaa istemaal kyon nahin karte hai, jo jawaab dete hai
 And this answer has been given by the Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju in the Lok Sabha
 22 disambar 2015 ko lalganj kii saansad neelam sonkar ke sawaal ke jawaab main grih rajya mantri ne kaha ki ''raksha mantralay ne suchit kiya he ki 'shahid' shabd bhartiya sashastr senaaon main kinhin cazcelatiz ke sandarbh main prayukt nahin kiya jaataa
 Similarly, such a term is not used to refer to the death of soldiers of Central Armed Police Forces and Assam Rifles during an action or action
 yahi jawaab 18 farvir 2014 ko purv grih rajya mantri arpyen singh ne loksabhaa main diya tha ki sarkaar ne kabhi shahid shabd ko paribhaashit nahin kiya he
 The ABVP should ask Kiren Rijiju why the word martyr is not used for soldiers who die for the country
 sarkaar or sena apni jaan kii qurbaani dene vaale ko shahid nahin kahati he
 You will get this answer from the Lok Sabha website
 aap print out lekar inhen twit kar sakate hai
 The Indian government does not use the word martyr for soldiers who died on the border
 akhbaar or tivi ko lekar satark ho jaaiye varna is desh kaa bedaa gark karne waalon main aap bhi shaamil honge
 Most of these work has become alive for the sake of government
 gurmeher cor ne jitna bol liya tha utana bol liya he
 People have spoken against him and have also spoken in support
 wo ek chaatra he
 What can be bigger than this, that this first year student has been supported by her teachers
 ladi shriram college ke angrezi vibhaag ke teacheron ne ek bayaan jari kiya he jisamen likhaa he, 'ham ladi shriram college ke angrezi vibhaag ke faikalti member saafataur par or majbooti se apni chaatra gurmeher cor kaa samarthan karte hai
 Supports his right to express his views on university-related issues
 ham shikshakon ke liye ye kaafii santoshjanak he ki usne apane aasapaas bane maahaul par chuppi kaa sahaara lene ke bajaay badi hi samvedansheeltaa, rachanaatmakataa or bahaduree ke saath khud ko vyakt kiya he
 We feel that it is the duty of educational institutions to make their students sensitive and accountable and away from the fear of violent revenge action and develop their capacity for critical thinking
 hamen garv he ki gurmeher ne is desh ke ek yuva naagarik ke taur par apana kartavya nibhaayaa he
 We condemn the threats of violence and vandalism she is receiving
 virendra sahvaag or randeep huda jaise public figures dwaara soshal media par die gaye jawaab us dhamkee or dar kaa sharmnaak rup hai jiskaa saamana gurmeher kar rahi hai, us hinsak bheed kii taraf se jiskaa rup uniwarsity ne haal hi main dekha
 We appeal to the public for understanding
 ham un sansthaanon se bhi samajhadaari kii apil karte hai jinke haath main ye zimmedaari he ki wo kaanoon or nyaay main logon kaa bharosa behaal karen or hamaare yuva nagarikon ke liye bina dare sochane or khud ko vyakt karne kaa maahaul den
 
 
 ' sarkaron ke paas takat bahut hoti he
 When we and you forget this incident, it will find a way out
 gurmeher cor kaa samarthan dene vaale shikshakon ko pareshaan karegi
 Will send notice unke register check karavaaegi
 Many teachers neither speak for themselves nor for their students
 bahut se shikshak is desh main dahez lekar shaadi karte hai or shikshak diwas ke din devtaa banakar ghoomte hai
 For such teachers, i am reading the names of those teachers who have supported Gurmehar
 janet lalwampui, nangoum maheshakanta singh, maitreyi mandal, jonthan vagchz, rachita mittal, shernaz kama, aarti minocha, ruyeesana shrauf, madhu grover, vafaa hamid, reeta joshi, maaya joshi, tania sachdev, mitali mishra, arunima re, dipti nath, karunaa rajeev, tania sachdev
 Be prepared for a story of how the supporting teachers were harassed
 ek teacher ko apni chaatra kaa saath nahin dena chahie to kya karnaa chahie, khaskar tab jab uske kilaaf mantri or saansad bol rahe hon
 On Twitter, he is being threatened with rape and abuses in writing
 maan lijie ki aapaki beti vahaan padhati ho to teacher ko kya karnaa chahie
 In this sense, it is a big deal
 abivipi ne somvaar ko apni taraf se tirangaa yatra kaa aayojan kiya tha
 BJP leader Shaina NC has said that there should be a debate on whoever is in trouble
 hinsa kii koi jagah nahin honi chahie
 ABVP leader Saket Bahuguna has filed a complaint at the Morris Nagar police station
 kaha he ki media ke madhyam se puure desh se or mujhase bhi tivi studio main ye baat kahi he ki kuch log unhen soshal media par jaan se maarane or balaatkaar kii dhamkee de rahe hai
 It is wrong for any citizen of the country to receive such threats
 police ko aise tatwon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kerani chahie
 Unfortunately Gurmehar ji is blaming our organization ABVP but i want to make it clear that none of our liabilities are involved in this
 der se hi sahi, saket bahuguna ne acha kaam kiya he
 Saket should also tell Kiren Rijiju that you should support Gurmehar, protect because she is alone
 bhale hi usne hamaara virodh kiya he
 Still, Saket did as much as he has
 saket ko ab un tasveeron ko dekhnaa chahie jisamen uske sanghathan ke log hinsa karte dikhaaye gaye hai
 If they want, they can remove the members who commit violence
 bhale hi duusare gut ke hinsa karne vaale apane sanghathan main bane rahen magar saket bahuguna ke paas ek shandaar mauka he virodhiyon ko jawaab dene kaa or apane sanghathan ko sandesh dene kaa ki ham hinsa nahin karenge
 It is expected that this talk of Saket Bahuguna will reach the ministers and mps who were looking for those who corrupted Gurmehar's mind
 uske ek saal puraane video ke aadhaar par uski deshbhakti yaa samadh ko chunauti de rahe the
 The representative of any government may dislike the talk of the girls but cannot challenge their understanding or independent thinking
 baharhaal ab gurmeher ne khud ko aage kii kaarywahi se alag karte hue bayaan diya he ki, 'I am separating myself from the campaign
 aap sabhi ko badhai
 Leave me alone mujhe jo kahana tha wo maine kah diya
 One thing that is certain is that now we will think twice before committing violence or threatening someone, and so i was opposed
 ye campan chaatro ke liye he, mere liye nahin
 Participate in large numbers in March, whoever is questioning my courage and bravery
 unke liye kahuungi ki maine zarurat se zyaada himmat dikhaai he
 ' gurmeher cor ne apana kaam kar diya he
 Many girls have voiced with them and even before them
 hamane kuch noujvaan ladakiyon se poocha ki jab wo bolti hai, pehali baar bolti hai yaa baar baar bolti hai to unke aas paas kaa samaaj unke saath kis tarah kaa bartaav karata he
 With what fear does she first liberate herself, and when she is free, how can she speak and which scares someone
 koun hai jo ladakiyon ke bolne par kehete hai ki bahut bolti ho, bologi to dekh lenaa, aaj ke prime time kaa makasad iske jawaab main un ladakiyon ko samaane laana he jo bolti hai, taaki aap unhen dekh saken
 Surely she should not get any benefit due to being a girl, her talk should be opposed on the basis of arguments
 bahes honi chahie lekin jab koi kisi ladki ko chup karaaye to uski baat ke liye na sahi, uski himmat ke liye uskaa saath dena chahie
 Honey, a student of Miranda House, has sent us a video in which she is saying, 'everyone should raise their voice, not me or who will raise their voice
 ' ladakiyon ke liye kitni hidaayat hoti he phir bhi koi na koi aage aati he bolne ke liye
 His family is requested not to be afraid too much
 siddhi kahati hai ki jab bhi unke saath kii ladkiyaan bolne ko hoti hai unhen suraksha kii yaad dilaakar chup kara diya jaataa he
 Who are those people who become a threat when a girl speaks? uski baat kaa virodh kiijie
 Disagree but who are the people who say it, that they say will not be okay
 kya aisi awaz kursi par baithe logon se bhi aa rahi he
 Somewhere you do not support such people who talk about seeing girls when they speak
 samaaj se lekar tamaam sarkaron main aise logon kii kami nahin hai
 Yamini Dixit is one such student who wants to share her speaking experience with you
 yamini uniwarsity main ek aisi jagah ke liye lard rahi he jahaan kisi bhi tarah kaa matbhed baatcheet ke zariye suljhaayaa ja sake
 How the fights took place in Ramjas College, who threw stones, what the police were doing, it is being investigated and there will never be a result
 isliye prime time main hamaara makasad us jhagade ke kaarnon yaa paksh vipaksh main janaa nahin he
 We are trying to see in the context of the controversy over Gurmehar what happens to a girl when she speaks
 wo bolne se pehle khud se kaise ladati he, jab wo bolti he to usase duniya kaise ladati he
 We are talking that the responsibility of ending the fear of violence is as much as abvp's responsibility to AISA, the police and university have the most accountability for both of them
 hamane in ladakiyon se sahmati lee he, unhone bhi himmat dikhaai he ki ve bolne ke halaat par bolengi
 The government will not decide the way of protest in the world
 log tay karenge
 Now see, the Prime Minister started Mann Ki Baat
 iske jawaab main congress ke netaa sandip dikshit ne kaam kii baat shuru kar di
 They also question the Prime Minister about the work through radio and put it on the Internet
 is tarah se loktantr faltaa phulata he
 Different sounds are heard
 in awaazon ke bich hi aap kisi ko pradhanmantri chunate hai or kisi ko nahin chunate hai
 Aditi from Miranda House says, 'I don't belong to any organization
 agar kisi ko kuch pasand nahin tha to unhen shantipurna pradarshan karnaa chahie
 He has many people afraid to write on social media
 ve raajnneeti se bhaagane lage hai
 This is not good for politics
 unhen kyon lagata he ki gaali dene waalon kaa giroh anaap shanaap likhane lagegaa
 Check the profile of your abuser
 dekhiye ki ve kis raajnneetik dal ke samarthak hai
 whatsapp is being spread in the name of information nowadays
 anaap shanaap afvaahen hai
 The whole system is engaged in defaming someone inside
 shaayad inhen sab vajahon se khaskar aam mahilaayein likhane se ghabraati hai
 What kind of things have been written on Gurmehar's post too
 police ne maamla to darj kiya he
 Let's see what happens
 mangalvaar ko dilli vishvavidhyalay main ek march hua
 This march was organized by students and teachers
 isa sanghathan bhi shaamil tha
 In this March, Sarvapriya Sangwan spoke to girls who are not from any organization but came against the politics of violence
 ummid he ki college prashasan aisi bolne vaali ladakiyon ko pareshaan nahin karegaa balki unhen ek patr jari karegaa ki aapane shantipurna pradarshan main hissaa lekar college kaa naam raushan kiya he
 Such a letter should be given to the principal of the college
 abivipi ke sadasyon ko bhi dena chahie or isa waalon ko bhi
 And also those students who are not from any organization like Aditi
 nidikshma sharma ramajas kii chaatra hai
 She says, 'we saw how our university turned into Riot Place
 ye baat rakhane ke liye hoti he
 It is important to protest because they want to scare us
 ' What kind of society are we letting on social media where girls have to think while speaking that there is danger? ghar se niklo to khatara, ghar main rahakar duniya se bolo tab bhi khatara
 When the tongue is not left, the daughters will save for whom
 kya sankhyikee vibhaag or mahila kalyaan vibhaag ke aankadon ke liye bachengi
 There are many girls who are combating these abusive gangs
 aane vaale vakt main unka yogadan yaad kiya jayega
 Remember one thing that abuses
 sarkarein or raajnneetik dal unka istemaal kar chhod denge
 Whatever they write on social media, they can take the name of any leader but in society they will never be able to tell that they write abuses in support of any political party
 logon ko dhamkaate hai
 Pranjal, a student, said, 'at first i did not want to come to this Protest because my parents were very worried
 aisa nahin he ki wo abivipi ko saport karte hai, lekin wo abivipi se darate hai ki kahin wo mujhe kuch na kar den
 Like Pranjal, Sarvapriya got a school student in Delhi University in March
 aditi
 She was with Pranjal
 aditi ne kaha ki dar unka hathiyaar ho gaya he or ladakiyon ke liye virodh karnaa zyaada zaruri he kyonki unhen bolaa jaataa he ki tum kamazor ho
 The comments duniya main tarah tarah ke virodh pradarshan ho rahe hai
 What a tremendous movement in India for the entry of women into the Haji Ali Dargah and the Shani Temple
 mahilaon ne yah andolan chalaaya
 Not to take votes in the name of your question but to change the society
 aapako nikita azaad yaad he
 Nikita of Patiala started the napkin movement alone
 nikita ne sabarimala mandir ke trustee ko patr likh diya ki main bees saal kii ladki hum, mere aankh, kaan, naak, hont, haath, paanv sab hai jaise duusare insaanon ke hai
 i am a woman who has menstruation
 maine maa ko kehete suna he ki aise samay main mandiron main nahin janaa chahie
 a woman is impure
 nikita ke is patr ne desh main hangaamaa machaa diya jisamen usne sabarimala waalon se poocha tha ki maahvaaree ke samay auraton ko mandir aane se kyon roka ja rahaa he
 He raised this question alone
 congress bijepi ke manch se nahin uthaaya
 The breath of the leaders of these parties will swell
 isliye zaruri he ki koi akele bhi awaz uthaae
 When someone does this, then we support
 awaz uthaane vaale se sawaal bhi karen
 Nikita was also questioned but it is not right to scare her
 ladkiyaan awaz uthaa rahi hai
 Do not support those who kill them in private or in the crowd for any reason
 ho saktaa he ki bheed ke paas sabase sahi tark hon, kaaran hon magar wo adaalat nahin he
 That is not the law
 sahi baat ke liye sadak par faisla karne kaa adhikaar uske paas nahin he
 This is not the case with the syllabus of chemistry
 aam zindagi ke silebus main he
 Can understand without going to school
 puraa itihaas bharaa padaa he, virodh ke nae nae hausalon se
 In every round, an opponent comes who gives that round a new status
 raajnneetik dal hi sirf virodh nahin karte hai
 People of the ruling party get all kinds of facilities when they protest
 police unka saath detii he
 The government supports virdohi dal ke liye thodi chunautiyaan hoti hai magar unke paas bhi takat hoti he
 This facility is not available to all the workers' organizations, farmer laborers and professional organizations
 virodh ke liye tamaam tarah ke sanghathan kii zarurat hoti he
 Political parties do not oppose every issue
 jaise agar aap abivipi or enesayuai se kahenge ki aap berojgaare or mahangi shiksha ke kilaaf desh bhar kii rajdhaniyon main pradarshan karen to ve katthak karne lagenge
 Because where they raise their voice, it is possible that their party can have a government
 dilli ke jantar mantar jaaiye
 Try going from the state capital to the district headquarters
 log kin paristhitiyon main apni maang ko lekar virodh pradarshan kar rahe hote hai
 In all of these, his opposition is the biggest one who raises his voice alone
 jab tak koi akelaa awaz uthaane vaala hota he tab tak yah ummid bhi bachi rahati he ki koi he
 Those who remain silent or ignore it only understand when they are victims of violence of government and society and call a leader or reporter
 gurmeher cor kaa virodh isliye bada tha ki usne apni baat kehane ke liye sanghathan nahin banaaya
 His opposition became greater when his voice was reacted by the Union government minister
 grih rajya mantri kiran rijiju ko kaayade se gurmeher cor kaa hausala badhanaa chahie tha magar unhone uske kilaaf tippanee kar sari sarkaar ko uske kilaaf kar diya
 Hence the opposition of Gurmehar Kaur is big
 gurmeher cor ne virodh to jataayaa tha ki wo abivipi se nahin darati hai
 When she spoke alone, the weak world of social media ran that someone spoke
 shaayad viral hua or phir gurmeher cor ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Everyone criticized the ABVP and the ABVP also responded, but a girl was afraid to speak alone that she is not afraid of ABVP
 is baat ko pal bhar main gaayab kar diya gaya or saamne laayaa gaya ek saal purana video, jise gurmeher cor ne kisi or sandarbh main you-tub par daalaa tha
 Now he was attacked with the help of that video
 is hamale main grih rajya mantri tak shaamil ho gaye
 The BJP MP said that Dawood Ibrahim also did not use the father's soldier to justify his anti-national
 zaahir he gurmeher kaa akelaapan or bad gaya or uskaa saahas bhi
 What was Gandhi's biggest contribution? unhone aam se aam logon ko is dar se azaad kar diya ki bina lathi ke banduukon se las or 200 saal se jami british hukumat kaa virodh kar sakate hai
 Without fear
 is buniyadi dar se jo bhi azaad karaane nikalataa he, samaaj or sarkaar ko dar lag jaataa he
 You go to Twitter and see what language has been used against Gurmehar
 ye isliye ki koi ladki sarkaar police dekh kar chup rahe
 Did not say
 magar ladki thodi ziddi nikali kah diya ki darati nahin he
 Now she has said that she has lifted her voice, now she will be silent
 baat sahi bhi he
 She is not scared, she has now put it on you that if you can stand with a single girl then show up
 koi ram sahab hai jo bharat or pakistan ke bich yuddh ke khilaaf hai
 Encourage peace
 vahi you tub main aise sandesh daalate hai
 On 28 April 2016, Gurmehar had posted this video in Hindi and English for him
 gurmeher cor is video main bataa rahi hai ki jab wo do saal kii thi to uske pita shahid ho gaye, chah saal kii thi to ek burkevali ko maarane kaa bhi prayaas kiya kyonki use lagata tha ki mere pita kii maut kii zimmedaar vahi he
 His mother then explained that my father was killed by war, not by Pakistan
 usne yahi likhaa ki nafrat ko bhoolanaa sikh liya
 It was not easy but not too difficult
 agar main aisa kar sakati hum to aap bhi kar sakate hai
 Today i am a soldier just like my father
 main bharat or pakistan ke bich shanti ke liye ladati hum kyonki agar yuddh nahin hua hota to mere pita aaj mere paas hote
 The world speaks against war
 sabko pataa he ki yuddh insaaniyat kaa dushman he isliye chhutbhaiya se lekar bade netaa shanti kii baat karte hai
 When Gurmehar put this video on youtube, a young Pakistani man Faiyaz Khan supported him
 abhi tak aapane mitra desh suna hoga, shatru desh suna hoga, faiyaaz khan ne gurmeher cor ke saath ek nae desh kii kalpana pesh kii
 Sibling country means siblings' country
 ham zindagi main isliye aate hai nayaa or kuubasurat sochane
 Fayyaz Khan lives in Australia
 6 may 2016 ko ye video you tub par daalaa
 There is some Ram sahib who runs a movement on You Tube to encourage peace between India and Pakistan
 usee video main faiyaz kehete hai
 
 
 Hi Gurmehar Kaur, i am Fayaz Khan from Pakistan
 jab main pehali baar australia aayaa to sabhi bharatiyon ko vaise dekhtaa tha jaise mujhe skool main sikhaaya gaya tha
 But soon we started eating in the class room, sharing chairs as if we were close friends
 kargil yuddh main tumhaare pita kii maut par ham sabhi ko afsos he
 i have seen war, have seen deaths in my hometown of Swat but have not lost any member of my house by luck, but i have thousands of Gurmehar Kaur around me
 main bharat aana chahta hum bina kisi viza kii pabandi kii
 We will fight together against these restrictions
 seemaa ke donon taraf hazaron logon ko gurmeher cor kii tarah takalifon se guzaranaa na pade, ham iske liye ladenge
 i cannot give you the love of your father, but of course you have got a brother from the enemy country
 chalo is duniya main ek anokhaa rishta banaate hai jahaan bhai ek musalmaan he or bahan ek sikh
 Now this enemy country replaces the word with Sibling country
 matlab bhai bahan kaa desh kar dete hai
 This effect was from Gurmehar's video
 gurmeher cor ke video ke khilaaf bhi kai video aa rahe hai
 He is also being criticized
 hamaara focus is baat par he jab koi akeli ladki bolti he to kya hota he
 Go to Twitter and submit the abuses given to Gurmehar Kaur
 nari devi he ke naam par nautanki karne vaale samaaj kii pole khul jaaegi
 What is the point, Gurmehar Kaur posted the video that she is not afraid of ABVP
 magar use kinare karne ke liye ek saal purana video nikaala gaya or is tarah pesh kiya gaya jaise wo pakistan ke khilaaf ladate hue maare gaye sainikon kii qurbaani ko chota kar rahi he
 Is using her father
 dhundne waalon ko usee you-tub par yahi video mila hoga lekin unhone aap tak yah baat nahin failaai kyonki koshish he ki aap rashtrawaad ke naam par sankate rahen
 Keep giving the feeling of violence inside you a chance
 gurmeher ke post ne jo hasil kiya wo hazaar mixilon se bhi duniya main ajtak kahin bhi hasil nahin ho sakaa he
 Sibling Country
 bhai bahan kaa desh
 We did not use the word martyr
 ham nahin karte hai
 You ask why we do not use martyrs, who answer
 or ye jawaab grih rajya mantri kiren rijiju ne loksabhaa main diya he
 In reply to the question of Lalganj MP Neelam Sonkar on 22 December 2015, the Minister of State for Home Affairs said that "the Ministry of Defense has informed that the word 'martyr' is not used in the context of any casualties in the Indian Armed Forces
" isi prakaar kisi kaary yaa kaarywahi ke dauraan kendriya sashastr police balon or assam rifles ke javaanon kii mrityu ho jane ke sandarbh main bhi aisa shabd prayukt nahin hota he
 The same answer was given by former Minister of State for Home RPN Singh in Lok Sabha on 18 February 2014 that the government has never defined the term martyr
 abivipi ko kiren rijiju se poochna chahie ki desh ke liye jaan dene vaale sainikon ke liye shahid shabd kaa istemaal kyon nahin hota he
 The government and the military do not call those who sacrificed their lives a martyr
 yah jawaab aapako loksabhaa kii website se mil jaayenge
 You can take a print out and tweet them
 bharat sarkaar seemaa par jaan dene vaale sainikon ke liye shahid shabd kaa istemaal nahin karti he
 Be cautious about newspapers and TV or else you will be among those who grumble the fleet of this country
 inamen se zyaadaatar kaa kaam hukumat ke liye zindaabad bolnaa ho gaya he
 Gurmehar Kaur has spoken as much as she spoke
 uske virodh main log bole to samarthan main bhi bole hai
 She is a student isse badi baat kya ho sakati he ki pratham varsh kii is chaatra kaa saath uske shikshakon ne diya he
 Teachers in the English Department of Lady Shri Ram College have issued a statement which states, 'we are a faculty member of the English Department of Lady Shri Ram College, clearly and strongly supporting our student Gurmehar Kaur
 uniwarsity se jude muddon par apane vichaaron ko rakhane ke uske adhikaar kaa samarthan karte hai
 It is quite satisfying for us teachers that they have expressed themselves with great sensitivity, creativity and bravery rather than resorting to silence on the environment around them
 hamen lagata he ki shiksha sansthaanon kaa ye kartavya he ki wo apane chaatro ko hinsaatmak badale kii karrwai ke dar se dur unhen samvedansheel or javabdeh banaaen or unamem aalochanatmak chintan kii kshamta viksit karen
 We are proud that Gurmehar has performed his duty as a young citizen of this country
 use mil rahi hinsa or barbarta kii dhamkiyon kii ham ninda karte hai
 Social media responses by public figures such as Virender Sehwag and Randeep Hooda are shameful forms of intimidation and fear that Gurmehar is facing, towards the violent mob that the university has recently witnessed
 ham janata se samajhadaari kii apil karte hai
 We also appeal to those institutions that have the responsibility to restore people's trust in law and justice and provide an environment for our young citizens to think fearlessly and express themselves
 
 
 ' Governments have a lot of power
 ham or aap jab is ghatana ko bhul jaayenge to wo koi tarika nikaalegi
 The teachers supporting Gurmehar Kaur will harass her
 notice bhejegi
 They will get their register checked
 bahut se shikshak na to apane liye bol pate hai na apane chaatr ke liye
 Many teachers marry in this country with dowry and roam on the day of the teacher as deities
 aise shikshakon ke liye main un shikshakon kaa naam pard rahaa hum jinhone gurmeher kaa saath diya he
 Janet Lalwampui, Nangoum Maheshakanta Singh, Maitreyi Mandal, Johnathan Vagchaz, Rachita Mittal, Shernaz Cama, Aarti Minocha, Rukhsana Shroff, Madhu Grover, Wafa Hamid, Rita Joshi, Maya Joshi, Tania Sachdev, Mitali Mishra, Arunima Ray, Dipti Kar Rajeev, Tania Sachdev
 aisi story ke liye taiyaar rahiye ki samarthan karne vaale teacheron ko kaise pareshaan kiya gaya
 What should a teacher do to not support her student, especially when the minister and MP are speaking against her
 twitor par use balaatkaar karne kii dhamkiyaan di ja rahi hon or likhakar gaaliyaan di ja rahi hon
 Suppose your daughter studies there, what should the teacher do
 is lihaaz se ye badi baat he
 The ABVP organized a tricolor trip on its behalf on Monday
 bijepi netaa shina ensi ne kaha he ki jise bhi pareshaani he use lekar bahes honi chahie
 There should be no place for violence
 abivipi ke netaa saket bahuguna ne morris nagar thane main shikaayat darj karai he
 It has been said that through the media from all over the country and also in TV studios, it has been said that some people are threatening to kill and rape them on social media
 desh ke kisi bhi naagarik ko aisi dhamkiyaan milanaa galat he
 The police should take strong action against such elements
 durbhaagya se gurmeher ji hamaare sanghathan abivipi par aarope laga rahi hai lekin main saaf karnaa chahta hum ki hamaara koi bhi daayitvadharee isamen shaamil nahin he
 As of late, Saket Bahuguna has done a good job
 saket ko kiren rijiju se bhi kahana chahie ki aap gurmeher kaa saath dijie, suraksha kiijie kyonki wo akeli he
 Even though he has opposed us
 phir bhi jitna uske bas main he utana to saket ne kiya hi
 Saket should now look at the pictures in which the people of his organization are shown committing violence
 wo chahen to hinsa karne vaale sadasyon ko nikaal sakate hai
 Even though the violence of the other factions remains in their organization, Saket Bahuguna has a great chance to respond to the opponents and send a message to his organization that we will not commit violence
 ummid he saket bahuguna kii yah baat mantriyon or saansadon tak pahonchegi jo gurmeher ke dimaag ko dooshit karne waalon kaa pataa laga rahe the
 Based on his one year old video, he was challenging his patriotism
 kisi bhi sarkaar kaa numaayinda ladakiyon kii baat ko bhale naapsand kare magar uski samaj yaa swatantra soch ko chunauti nahin de saktaa he
 However, now Gurmehar has made a statement separating himself from further proceedings, 'main campan se khud ko alag kar rahi hum
 Congratulations to all of you
 mujhe akelaa chhod den
 i said what i had to say
 ek cheez jo nishchit he ki ab ham hinsa karne yaa kisi ko dhamkee dene se pehle do baar sochenge, or isliye meraa virodh tha
 This campaign is for students, not for me
 march main badi sankhya main hissaa len jo koi bhi mere saahas or bahaduree par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 i will say to them that i have shown more courage than i have
 ' Gurmehar Kaur has done her work
 unke saath or unke pehle bhi bahut si ladakiyon ne awaz uthaai he
 We asked some young girls how the society around them treats them when they speak, for the first time or they speak again and again
 ve pehle kis dar se khud ko azaad karti hai or jab azaad hoti hai to unka bolnaa kis tarah se or kis kis ko daraa detaa he
 Who are the girls who say that they speak a lot, if you speak, then see, the purpose of today's prime time is to bring the girls who speak in response, so that you can see them
 zarur ladki hone ke kaaran use koi phayda nahin milanaa chahie, uski baat kaa tarkon ke aadhaar virodh hona chahie
 There should be debate, but when someone silences a girl, it should not be right for her to speak, to support her for her courage
 miranda house kii chaatra hani ne ek video hamen bheja he jisamen wo kah rahi hai, 'sabko awaz uthaani chahie, main nahin ham nahin to koun awaz uthayega
 'there is so much instruction for girls, yet someone comes forward to speak
 inaki parivaar waalon se guzarish he ki itnaa bhi na daren
 Siddhi says that whenever girls accompanying her are to speak, they are reminded of safety and kept silent
 wo koun log hai jo ladki ke bolne par khatara ban jate hai
 Resist his point
 asahmat hoiye lekin use yah bolne vaale koun log hote hai jo kehete hai ki thik nahin hoga
 Is such a voice coming from people sitting in a chair
 kahin aap aise logon kaa samarthan to nahin karte jo ladakiyon ke bolne par dekh lene kii baat karte hai
 There is no dearth of such people from society to all governments
 yamini dikshit aisi hi ek chaatra hai jo bolne ke apane anubhav ko aapse saajha karnaa chaahati hai
 Yamini is fighting for a place in the university where any kind of differences can be resolved through dialogue
 ramajas college main jhagade kaise hue, pathar kisne phenke, police kya kar rahi thi, isaki jaanch ho rahi he or kabhi nateeja nahin aayega
 So in prime time our motive is not to go into the reasons or side opposition to that quarrel
 ham gurmeher ko lekar hue vivaad ke sandarbh main dekhne kii koshish kar rahe hai ki jab koi ladki bolti he to uske saath kya kya hota he
 How does she fight herself before speaking, how does the world fight her when she speaks
 ham baat kar rahe hai ki hinsa kaa dar samaapt karne kii zimmedaari jitna abivipi kii he utani hi isa kii he, in donon se sabase adhik javabdehi police or uniwarsity kii he
 We have taken consent from these girls, they have also shown courage that they will speak on the situation of speaking
 duniya main virodh kaa tarika sarkaar nahin tay karegi
 People will decide
 ab dekhiye pradhanmantri ne man kii baat shuru kii
 In response, Congress leader Sandeep Dixit started talking about work
 ve bhi radio ke zariye kaam kii baat main pradhanmantri se sawaal karte hai or internet par daal dete hai
 This is how democracy thrives
 tarah tarah kii awaazen sunai detii hai
 Between these voices, you choose someone as Prime Minister and you do not choose anyone
 miranda house kii aditi kahati hai, 'main kisi sanghathan kii nahin hum
 If someone did not like something, they should have a peaceful demonstration
 unke paas soshal media par bahut se log likhane se darate hai
 They are running away from politics
 yah raajnneeti ke liye acha nahin he
 Why do they think that the gang of abusers will start writing anonymously
 aap gaali dene waalon kii profile check kiijie
 See which political party they are supporters of
 whatsap aajkal soochna ke naam par kachra failaayaa ja rahaa he
 There are rumors of anonymity
 puraa tantra laga hua he kisi ko bheetar bheetar badnaam karne main
 Probably for all these reasons especially ordinary women are afraid to write
 gurmeher ke post par bhi kisi kisi baaten likhi gai hai
 The police has registered a case
 dekhte hai kya hota he
 On Tuesday, a march took place at Delhi University
 is march kaa aayojan chaatr or shikshakon ne kiya tha
 The AISA organization was also involved
 is march main sarvapriya sangwan ne un ladakiyon se baat kii jo kisi sanghathan kii to nahin hai magar hinsa kii raajnneeti ke virodh main ain thim
 Hopefully the college administration will not disturb such speaking girls but will issue a letter to them that you have brightened the name of the college by participating in a peaceful demonstration
 aisa patr college ke principal ko dena chahie
 It should be given to the members of ABVP and also to the people of AISA
 or un chaatro ko bhi jo kisi sanghathan se nahin hai jaise aditi
 Nidikshma Sharma is a student of Ramjas
 wo kahati hai, 'hamane dekha ki kaise hamaari uniwarsity rit place main badal gai
 This thing is meant to be kept
 virodh karnaa zaruri he kyonki wo hamen daraana chaahate hai
 ' soshal media par ham kaisaa samaaj banane de rahe hai jahaan ladakiyon ko bolte vakt sochna pade ki khatara to nahin he
 If you come out of the house then there is danger, stay at home and speak to the world even then there is danger jab jubaan hi nahin bachegi to betiyaan kiske liye bachengi
 Will the statistics department and women's welfare department survive for data
 bahut si ladkiyaan hai jo in gaali dene vaale girohon kaa muqabla kar rahi hai
 His contribution will be remembered in times to come
 gaali dene vaale ek baat yaad rakhen
 Governments and political parties will quit using them
 ve soshal media main chaahe jo likh len, jis bhi netaa kaa naam le len magar samaaj main kabhi nahin bataa sakenge ki ve kisi raajnneetik dal ke samarthan main gaaliyaan likhte hai
 Threaten people
 ek chaatra pranjal ne kaha, 'pehle main is protest main aana nahin chaahati thi kyonki mere parent bahut chintit the
 It is not that they support ABVP, but they are afraid of ABVP not to do anything to me
 pranjal kii tarah hi sarvapriya ko dilli vishvavidhyalay ke march main skool kii ek chaatra mili
 Aditi wo pranjal ke saath hi thi
 Aditi said that fear has become her weapon and it is more important for girls to protest because they are told that you are weak
 tippaniyan Various types of protests are taking place in the world
 bharat main hi haazi ali dargah or shani mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh ko lekar kitna jabardast andolan hua
 Women started this movement
 apane sawaal ke naam par vot lene ke liye nahin balki samaaj ko badalane ke liye
 You remember Nikita Azad
 patiala kii nikita ne akele napkin andolan kii shuruyaat kar di
 Nikita wrote a letter to the trustee of the Sabarimala temple that i am a twenty year old girl, my eyes, ears, nose, lips, hands, feet are all like other human beings
 main ek aurat hum jise maahvaaree hoti he
 i have heard mother say that one should not go to temples at such times
 aurat apavitra hoti he
 This letter from Nikita created uproar in the country in which she asked the Sabarimala people why women are being prevented from coming to the temple during menstruation
 yah sawaal usne akele uthaaya
 Congress did not lift from bjp's platform
 in dalon ke netaaon kii saansen phool jaaengi
 So it is important that someone should raise their voice alone
 jab koi aisa kare to ham saath den
 Also ask a voice person
 nikita se bhi sawaal hue magar use sawaal karne ke liye daraana thik nahin he
 Girls are raising their voices
 inhen akele main yaa bheed main kisi bhi kaaran se maarane waalon ko dhamkaane waalon kaa saath mat dijie
 It may be that the crowd has the right arguments, reasons, but it is not the court
 wo kanoon nahin he
 He does not have the right to decide on the road for the right thing
 yah baat chemistry ke silebus kaa nahin he
 Is in the syllabus of common life
 bina skool gaye samaj main aa sakati he
 In all of these, his opposition is the biggest one who raises his voice alone
 jab tak koi akelaa awaz uthaane vaala hota he tab tak yah ummid bhi bachi rahati he ki koi he
 Those who remain silent or ignore it only understand when they are victims of violence of government and society and call a leader or reporter
 gurmeher cor kaa virodh isliye bada tha ki usne apni baat kehane ke liye sanghathan nahin banaaya
 His opposition became greater when his voice was reacted by the Union government minister
 grih rajya mantri kiran rijiju ko kaayade se gurmeher cor kaa hausala badhanaa chahie tha magar unhone uske kilaaf tippanee kar sari sarkaar ko uske kilaaf kar diya
 Hence the opposition of Gurmehar Kaur is big
 gurmeher cor ne virodh to jataayaa tha ki wo abivipi se nahin darati hai
 When she spoke alone, the weak world of social media ran that someone spoke
 shaayad viral hua or phir gurmeher cor ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Everyone criticized the ABVP and the ABVP also responded, but a girl was afraid to speak alone that she is not afraid of ABVP
 is baat ko pal bhar main gaayab kar diya gaya or saamne laayaa gaya ek saal purana video, jise gurmeher cor ne kisi or sandarbh main you-tub par daalaa tha
 Now he was attacked with the help of that video
 is hamale main grih rajya mantri tak shaamil ho gaye
 The BJP MP said that Dawood Ibrahim also did not use the father's soldier to justify his anti-national
 zaahir he gurmeher kaa akelaapan or bad gaya or uskaa saahas bhi
 What was Gandhi's biggest contribution? unhone aam se aam logon ko is dar se azaad kar diya ki bina lathi ke banduukon se las or 200 saal se jami british hukumat kaa virodh kar sakate hai
 Without fear
 is buniyadi dar se jo bhi azaad karaane nikalataa he, samaaj or sarkaar ko dar lag jaataa he
 You go to Twitter and see what language has been used against Gurmehar
 ye isliye ki koi ladki sarkaar police dekh kar chup rahe
 Did not say
 magar ladki thodi ziddi nikali kah diya ki darati nahin he
 Now she has said that she has lifted her voice, now she will be silent
 baat sahi bhi he
 She is not scared, she has now put it on you that if you can stand with a single girl then show up
 koi ram sahab hai jo bharat or pakistan ke bich yuddh ke khilaaf hai
 Encourage peace
 vahi you tub main aise sandesh daalate hai
 On 28 April 2016, Gurmehar had posted this video in Hindi and English for him
 gurmeher cor is video main bataa rahi hai ki jab wo do saal kii thi to uske pita shahid ho gaye, chah saal kii thi to ek burkevali ko maarane kaa bhi prayaas kiya kyonki use lagata tha ki mere pita kii maut kii zimmedaar vahi he
 His mother then explained that my father was killed by war, not by Pakistan
 usne yahi likhaa ki nafrat ko bhoolanaa sikh liya
 It was not easy but not too difficult
 agar main aisa kar sakati hum to aap bhi kar sakate hai
 Today i am a soldier just like my father
 main bharat or pakistan ke bich shanti ke liye ladati hum kyonki agar yuddh nahin hua hota to mere pita aaj mere paas hote
 The world speaks against war
 sabko pataa he ki yuddh insaaniyat kaa dushman he isliye chhutbhaiya se lekar bade netaa shanti kii baat karte hai
 When Gurmehar put this video on youtube, a young Pakistani man Faiyaz Khan supported him
 abhi tak aapane mitra desh suna hoga, shatru desh suna hoga, faiyaaz khan ne gurmeher cor ke saath ek nae desh kii kalpana pesh kii
 Sibling country means siblings' country
 ham zindagi main isliye aate hai nayaa or kuubasurat sochane
 Fayyaz Khan lives in Australia
 6 may 2016 ko ye video you tub par daalaa
 There is some Ram sahib who runs a movement on You Tube to encourage peace between India and Pakistan
 usee video main faiyaz kehete hai
 
 
 Hi Gurmehar Kaur, i am Fayaz Khan from Pakistan
 jab main pehali baar australia aayaa to sabhi bharatiyon ko vaise dekhtaa tha jaise mujhe skool main sikhaaya gaya tha
 But soon we started eating in the class room, sharing chairs as if we were close friends
 kargil yuddh main tumhaare pita kii maut par ham sabhi ko afsos he
 i have seen war, have seen deaths in my hometown of Swat but have not lost any member of my house by luck, but i have thousands of Gurmehar Kaur around me
 main bharat aana chahta hum bina kisi viza kii pabandi kii
 We will fight together against these restrictions
 seemaa ke donon taraf hazaron logon ko gurmeher cor kii tarah takalifon se guzaranaa na pade, ham iske liye ladenge
 i cannot give you the love of your father, but of course you have got a brother from the enemy country
 chalo is duniya main ek anokhaa rishta banaate hai jahaan bhai ek musalmaan he or bahan ek sikh
 Now this enemy country replaces the word with Sibling country
 matlab bhai bahan kaa desh kar dete hai
 This effect was from Gurmehar's video
 gurmeher cor ke video ke khilaaf bhi kai video aa rahe hai
 He is also being criticized
 hamaara focus is baat par he jab koi akeli ladki bolti he to kya hota he
 Go to Twitter and submit the abuses given to Gurmehar Kaur
 nari devi he ke naam par nautanki karne vaale samaaj kii pole khul jaaegi
 What is the point, Gurmehar Kaur posted the video that she is not afraid of ABVP
 magar use kinare karne ke liye ek saal purana video nikaala gaya or is tarah pesh kiya gaya jaise wo pakistan ke khilaaf ladate hue maare gaye sainikon kii qurbaani ko chota kar rahi he
 Is using her father
 dhundne waalon ko usee you-tub par yahi video mila hoga lekin unhone aap tak yah baat nahin failaai kyonki koshish he ki aap rashtrawaad ke naam par sankate rahen
 Keep giving the feeling of violence inside you a chance
 gurmeher ke post ne jo hasil kiya wo hazaar mixilon se bhi duniya main ajtak kahin bhi hasil nahin ho sakaa he
 Sibling Country
 bhai bahan kaa desh
 We did not use the word martyr
 ham nahin karte hai
 You ask why we do not use martyrs, who answer
 or ye jawaab grih rajya mantri kiren rijiju ne loksabhaa main diya he
 In reply to the question of Lalganj MP Neelam Sonkar on 22 December 2015, the Minister of State for Home Affairs said that "the Ministry of Defense has informed that the word 'martyr' is not used in the context of any casualties in the Indian Armed Forces
" isi prakaar kisi kaary yaa kaarywahi ke dauraan kendriya sashastr police balon or assam rifles ke javaanon kii mrityu ho jane ke sandarbh main bhi aisa shabd prayukt nahin hota he
 The same answer was given by former Minister of State for Home RPN Singh in Lok Sabha on 18 February 2014 that the government has never defined the term martyr
 abivipi ko kiren rijiju se poochna chahie ki desh ke liye jaan dene vaale sainikon ke liye shahid shabd kaa istemaal kyon nahin hota he
 The government and the military do not call those who sacrificed their lives a martyr
 yah jawaab aapako loksabhaa kii website se mil jaayenge
 You can take a print out and tweet them
 bharat sarkaar seemaa par jaan dene vaale sainikon ke liye shahid shabd kaa istemaal nahin karti he
 Be cautious about newspapers and TV or else you will be among those who grumble the fleet of this country
 inamen se zyaadaatar kaa kaam hukumat ke liye zindaabad bolnaa ho gaya he
 Gurmehar Kaur has spoken as much as she spoke
 uske virodh main log bole to samarthan main bhi bole hai
 She is a student isse badi baat kya ho sakati he ki pratham varsh kii is chaatra kaa saath uske shikshakon ne diya he
 Teachers in the English Department of Lady Shri Ram College have issued a statement which states, 'we are a faculty member of the English Department of Lady Shri Ram College, clearly and strongly supporting our student Gurmehar Kaur
 uniwarsity se jude muddon par apane vichaaron ko rakhane ke uske adhikaar kaa samarthan karte hai
 It is quite satisfying for us teachers that they have expressed themselves with great sensitivity, creativity and bravery rather than resorting to silence on the environment around them
 hamen lagata he ki shiksha sansthaanon kaa ye kartavya he ki wo apane chaatro ko hinsaatmak badale kii karrwai ke dar se dur unhen samvedansheel or javabdeh banaaen or unamem aalochanatmak chintan kii kshamta viksit karen
 We are proud that Gurmehar has performed his duty as a young citizen of this country
 use mil rahi hinsa or barbarta kii dhamkiyon kii ham ninda karte hai
 Social media responses by public figures such as Virender Sehwag and Randeep Hooda are shameful forms of intimidation and fear that Gurmehar is facing, towards the violent mob that the university has recently witnessed
 ham janata se samajhadaari kii apil karte hai
 We also appeal to those institutions that have the responsibility to restore people's trust in law and justice and provide an environment for our young citizens to think fearlessly and express themselves
 
 
 ' Governments have a lot of power
 ham or aap jab is ghatana ko bhul jaayenge to wo koi tarika nikaalegi
 The teachers supporting Gurmehar Kaur will harass her
 notice bhejegi
 They will get their register checked
 bahut se shikshak na to apane liye bol pate hai na apane chaatr ke liye
 Many teachers marry in this country with dowry and roam on the day of the teacher as deities
 aise shikshakon ke liye main un shikshakon kaa naam pard rahaa hum jinhone gurmeher kaa saath diya he
 Janet Lalwampui, Nangoum Maheshakanta Singh, Maitreyi Mandal, Johnathan Vagchaz, Rachita Mittal, Shernaz Cama, Aarti Minocha, Rukhsana Shroff, Madhu Grover, Wafa Hamid, Rita Joshi, Maya Joshi, Tania Sachdev, Mitali Mishra, Arunima Ray, Dipti Kar Rajeev, Tania Sachdev
 aisi story ke liye taiyaar rahiye ki samarthan karne vaale teacheron ko kaise pareshaan kiya gaya
 What should a teacher do to not support her student, especially when the minister and MP are speaking against her
 twitor par use balaatkaar karne kii dhamkiyaan di ja rahi hon or likhakar gaaliyaan di ja rahi hon
 Suppose your daughter studies there, what should the teacher do
 is lihaaz se ye badi baat he
 The ABVP organized a tricolor trip on its behalf on Monday
 bijepi netaa shina ensi ne kaha he ki jise bhi pareshaani he use lekar bahes honi chahie
 There should be no place for violence
 abivipi ke netaa saket bahuguna ne morris nagar thane main shikaayat darj karai he
 It has been said that through the media from all over the country and also in TV studios, it has been said that some people are threatening to kill and rape them on social media
 desh ke kisi bhi naagarik ko aisi dhamkiyaan milanaa galat he
 The police should take strong action against such elements
 durbhaagya se gurmeher ji hamaare sanghathan abivipi par aarope laga rahi hai lekin main saaf karnaa chahta hum ki hamaara koi bhi daayitvadharee isamen shaamil nahin he
 As of late, Saket Bahuguna has done a good job
 saket ko kiren rijiju se bhi kahana chahie ki aap gurmeher kaa saath dijie, suraksha kiijie kyonki wo akeli he
 Even though he has opposed us
 phir bhi jitna uske bas main he utana to saket ne kiya hi
 Saket should now look at the pictures in which the people of his organization are shown committing violence
 wo chahen to hinsa karne vaale sadasyon ko nikaal sakate hai
 Even though the violence of the other factions remains in their organization, Saket Bahuguna has a great chance to respond to the opponents and send a message to his organization that we will not commit violence
 ummid he saket bahuguna kii yah baat mantriyon or saansadon tak pahonchegi jo gurmeher ke dimaag ko dooshit karne waalon kaa pataa laga rahe the
 Based on his one year old video, he was challenging his patriotism
 kisi bhi sarkaar kaa numaayinda ladakiyon kii baat ko bhale naapsand kare magar uski samaj yaa swatantra soch ko chunauti nahin de saktaa he
 However, now Gurmehar has made a statement separating himself from further proceedings, 'main campan se khud ko alag kar rahi hum
 Congratulations to all of you
 mujhe akelaa chhod den
 i said what i had to say
 ek cheez jo nishchit he ki ab ham hinsa karne yaa kisi ko dhamkee dene se pehle do baar sochenge, or isliye meraa virodh tha
 This campaign is for students, not for me
 march main badi sankhya main hissaa len jo koi bhi mere saahas or bahaduree par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 i will say to them that i have shown more courage than i have
 ' Gurmehar Kaur has done her work
 unke saath or unke pehle bhi bahut si ladakiyon ne awaz uthaai he
 We asked some young girls how the society around them treats them when they speak, for the first time or they speak again and again
 ve pehle kis dar se khud ko azaad karti hai or jab azaad hoti hai to unka bolnaa kis tarah se or kis kis ko daraa detaa he
 Who are the girls who say that they speak a lot, if you speak, then see, the purpose of today's prime time is to bring the girls who speak in response, so that you can see them
 zarur ladki hone ke kaaran use koi phayda nahin milanaa chahie, uski baat kaa tarkon ke aadhaar virodh hona chahie
 There should be debate, but when someone silences a girl, it should not be right for her to speak, to support her for her courage
 miranda house kii chaatra hani ne ek video hamen bheja he jisamen wo kah rahi hai, 'sabko awaz uthaani chahie, main nahin ham nahin to koun awaz uthayega
 'there is so much instruction for girls, yet someone comes forward to speak
 inaki parivaar waalon se guzarish he ki itnaa bhi na daren
 Siddhi says that whenever girls accompanying her are to speak, they are reminded of safety and kept silent
 wo koun log hai jo ladki ke bolne par khatara ban jate hai
 Resist his point
 asahmat hoiye lekin use yah bolne vaale koun log hote hai jo kehete hai ki thik nahin hoga
 Is such a voice coming from people sitting in a chair
 kahin aap aise logon kaa samarthan to nahin karte jo ladakiyon ke bolne par dekh lene kii baat karte hai
 There is no dearth of such people from society to all governments
 yamini dikshit aisi hi ek chaatra hai jo bolne ke apane anubhav ko aapse saajha karnaa chaahati hai
 Yamini is fighting for a place in the university where any kind of differences can be resolved through dialogue
 ramajas college main jhagade kaise hue, pathar kisne phenke, police kya kar rahi thi, isaki jaanch ho rahi he or kabhi nateeja nahin aayega
 So in prime time our motive is not to go into the reasons or side opposition to that quarrel
 ham gurmeher ko lekar hue vivaad ke sandarbh main dekhne kii koshish kar rahe hai ki jab koi ladki bolti he to uske saath kya kya hota he
 How does she fight herself before speaking, how does the world fight her when she speaks
 ham baat kar rahe hai ki hinsa kaa dar samaapt karne kii zimmedaari jitna abivipi kii he utani hi isa kii he, in donon se sabase adhik javabdehi police or uniwarsity kii he
 We have taken consent from these girls, they have also shown courage that they will speak on the situation of speaking
 duniya main virodh kaa tarika sarkaar nahin tay karegi
 People will decide
 ab dekhiye pradhanmantri ne man kii baat shuru kii
 In response, Congress leader Sandeep Dixit started talking about work
 ve bhi radio ke zariye kaam kii baat main pradhanmantri se sawaal karte hai or internet par daal dete hai
 This is how democracy thrives
 tarah tarah kii awaazen sunai detii hai
 Between these voices, you choose someone as Prime Minister and you do not choose anyone
 miranda house kii aditi kahati hai, 'main kisi sanghathan kii nahin hum
 If someone did not like something, they should have a peaceful demonstration
 unke paas soshal media par bahut se log likhane se darate hai
 They are running away from politics
 yah raajnneeti ke liye acha nahin he
 Why do they think that the gang of abusers will start writing anonymously
 aap gaali dene waalon kii profile check kiijie
 See which political party they are supporters of
 whatsap aajkal soochna ke naam par kachra failaayaa ja rahaa he
 There are rumors of anonymity
 puraa tantra laga hua he kisi ko bheetar bheetar badnaam karne main
 Probably for all these reasons especially ordinary women are afraid to write
 gurmeher ke post par bhi kisi kisi baaten likhi gai hai
 The police has registered a case
 dekhte hai kya hota he
 On Tuesday, a march took place at Delhi University
 is march kaa aayojan chaatr or shikshakon ne kiya tha
 The AISA organization was also involved
 is march main sarvapriya sangwan ne un ladakiyon se baat kii jo kisi sanghathan kii to nahin hai magar hinsa kii raajnneeti ke virodh main ain thim
 Hopefully the college administration will not disturb such speaking girls but will issue a letter to them that you have brightened the name of the college by participating in a peaceful demonstration
 aisa patr college ke principal ko dena chahie
 It should be given to the members of ABVP and also to the people of AISA
 or un chaatro ko bhi jo kisi sanghathan se nahin hai jaise aditi
 Nidikshma Sharma is a student of Ramjas
 wo kahati hai, 'hamane dekha ki kaise hamaari uniwarsity rit place main badal gai
 This thing is meant to be kept
 virodh karnaa zaruri he kyonki wo hamen daraana chaahate hai
 ' soshal media par ham kaisaa samaaj banane de rahe hai jahaan ladakiyon ko bolte vakt sochna pade ki khatara to nahin he
 If you come out of the house then there is danger, stay at home and speak to the world even then there is danger jab jubaan hi nahin bachegi to betiyaan kiske liye bachengi
 Will the statistics department and women's welfare department survive for data
 bahut si ladkiyaan hai jo in gaali dene vaale girohon kaa muqabla kar rahi hai
 His contribution will be remembered in times to come
 gaali dene vaale ek baat yaad rakhen
 Governments and political parties will quit using them
 ve soshal media main chaahe jo likh len, jis bhi netaa kaa naam le len magar samaaj main kabhi nahin bataa sakenge ki ve kisi raajnneetik dal ke samarthan main gaaliyaan likhte hai
 Threaten people
 ek chaatra pranjal ne kaha, 'pehle main is protest main aana nahin chaahati thi kyonki mere parent bahut chintit the
 It is not that they support ABVP, but they are afraid of ABVP not to do anything to me
 pranjal kii tarah hi sarvapriya ko dilli vishvavidhyalay ke march main skool kii ek chaatra mili
 Aditi wo pranjal ke saath hi thi
 Aditi said that fear has become her weapon and it is more important for girls to protest because they are told that you are weak
 tippaniyan Various types of protests are taking place in the world
 bharat main hi haazi ali dargah or shani mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh ko lekar kitna jabardast andolan hua
 Women started this movement
 apane sawaal ke naam par vot lene ke liye nahin balki samaaj ko badalane ke liye
 You remember Nikita Azad
 patiala kii nikita ne akele napkin andolan kii shuruyaat kar di
 Nikita wrote a letter to the trustee of the Sabarimala temple that i am a twenty year old girl, my eyes, ears, nose, lips, hands, feet are all like other human beings
 main ek aurat hum jise maahvaaree hoti he
 i have heard mother say that one should not go to temples at such times
 aurat apavitra hoti he
 This letter from Nikita created uproar in the country in which she asked the Sabarimala people why women are being prevented from coming to the temple during menstruation
 yah sawaal usne akele uthaaya
 Congress did not lift from bjp's platform
 in dalon ke netaaon kii saansen phool jaaengi
 So it is important that someone should raise their voice alone
 jab koi aisa kare to ham saath den
 Also ask a voice person
 nikita se bhi sawaal hue magar use sawaal karne ke liye daraana thik nahin he
 Girls are raising their voices
 inhen akele main yaa bheed main kisi bhi kaaran se maarane waalon ko dhamkaane waalon kaa saath mat dijie
 It may be that the crowd has the right arguments, reasons, but it is not the court
 wo kanoon nahin he
 He does not have the right to decide on the road for the right thing
 yah baat chemistry ke silebus kaa nahin he
 Is in the syllabus of common life
 bina skool gaye samaj main aa sakati he
 Gurmehar Kaur had protested that she is not afraid of ABVP
 usne akele jab bolaa to soshal media kii kamazor duniya daud padi ki koi to bolaa
 Probably went viral and then Gurmehar Kaur was targeted
 abivipi kii aalochana to sabane kii or abivipi ne bhi dat kar jawaab diya magar ek ladki kaa akele bolne se ki wo abivipi se nahin darati he, isse dar to paidaa hua
 The matter disappeared in a moment and was brought to light by a year-old video, which Gurmehar Kaur had put on youtube on another reference
 ab us video ke sahare us par hamalaa hua
 The Minister of State for Home joined the attack
 bijepi ke saansad ne kaha ki daaud ibrahim ne bhi apane anti neshnal ko sahi tehraane ke liye baap ke sipaahi hone kaa istamaal nahin kiya
 Apparently Gurmehar's loneliness increased and his courage too
 gandhi kaa sabase bada yogadan kya tha
 He freed the common people from the fear that armed with sticks and could resist the British rule, which had been in existence for 200 years
 bina dare
 Whatever comes out of this basic fear, the society and the government get scared
 aap twitor par jaakar dekhiye, gurmeher ke khilaaf kis bhashaa kaa istamaal kiya gaya he
 This is because some girl kept silent after seeing the government police
 bole nahin
 But the girl turned out to be a bit stubborn and said that she is not afraid
 ab usne kaha he ki use jitna awaz uthaanaa tha uthaa liya, ab wo chup rahegi
 What has been said is correct
 wo dari nahin he, usne ab aap par daal diya he ki aap ek akeli ladki ke saath khadey ho sakate hai to khadey hokar dikhaaiye
 There are some Ram sahibs who are against the war between India and Pakistan
 shanti ko protsaahit karte hai
 They put such messages in youtube
 28 april 2016 ko unheen ke liye gurmeher ne hindi or angrezi main ye video daalaa tha
 Gurmehar Kaur is telling in this video that when she was two years old, her father was martyred, when she was six years old, she even tried to kill a burqewali because she thought she was the one responsible for my father's death
 tab uski maa ne samajhaayaa ki pakistan ne nahin mere pita ko jang ne maaraa he
 He wrote that he learned to forget hatred
 yah aasaan nahin tha lekin bahut mushkil bhi nahin
 If i can do it, you can too
 aaj main bhi apane pita kii tarah hi ek sainik hum
 i fight for peace between India and Pakistan because if there had not been a war, my father would have been with me today
 duniya yuddh ke kilaaf bolti he
 Everyone knows that war is the enemy of humanity so that's why leaders from smallpox to big talk talk about peace
 gurmeher ne jab yah video you tub par daalaa to uskaa saath pakistan ke ek noujvaan faiyaaz khan ne diya
 Till now you must have heard the allied country, the enemy country, Fayyaz Khan introduced the idea of a new country with Gurmehar Kaur
 sibling desh yani bhai bahan kaa desh
 This is why we come to life thinking new and beautiful
 australia main rahete hai faiyaaz khan
 On 6 May 2016, this video was uploaded to youtube
 koi ram sahab hai jo bharat pakistan ke bich shanti ko protsaahit karne ke liye you tub par andolan chalaate hai
 In the same video, Fayaz says
 
 
 hai gurmeher cor, main fayaaz khan hum pakistan se
 When i first came to Australia, i used to see all Indians as i was taught in school
 lekin jaldi hi humlog class room main khaanaa, kursiyaan saajha karne lage jaise ham kareebi dost hon
 We all regret the death of your father in the Kargil war
 maine yuddh dekha he, apane shahar swat main mautein dekhi hai lekin kismat se apane ghar ke kisi sadsy ko nahin khoyaa, lekin mere aasapaas hazaron gurmeher cor hai
 i want to come to India without any visa restriction
 ham donon in paabandiyon ke kilaaf mil kar ladenge
 Thousands of people on both sides of the border do not have to go through the hardships like Gurmehar Kaur, we will fight for it
 main tumhen tumhaare pita kaa pyaar to nahin de saktaa, lekin beshak tumhen dushman desh se ek bhai mil gaya he
 Let's create a unique relationship in this world where the brother is a Muslim and the sister a Sikh
 ab is dushman desh shabd ko sibling desh se badal dete hai
 That means, let's do siblings' country
 ye asar hua tha gurmeher ke video kaa
 There are many videos coming against Gurmehar Kaur's video as well
 unki aalochana bhi ho rahi he
 Our focus is on what happens when a single girl speaks
 aap twitor par jaakar gurmeher cor ko di gai gaaliyon ko jamaa kiijie
 In the name of Nari Devi Hai, the society of the gimmick will open
 mul baat kya he, gurmeher cor ne video daalaa ki wo abivipi se nahin darati he
 But to shore it up, a year old video was taken out and presented as if it is shortening the sacrifices of the soldiers killed while fighting against Pakistan
 apane pita kaa istemaal kar rahi he
 The seekers may have found the same video on the same youtube, but they did not spread it to you, because the effort is to keep on cracking in the name of nationalism
 apane andar hinsa kii bhaavana ko mauka dete rahen
 What Gurmehar's post has achieved has not been achieved anywhere in the world even with thousands of missiles
 sibling desh
 Country of siblings
 hamane shahid shabd kaa istemaal nahin kiya
 We do not
 aap puuchhiye ki ham shahid kaa istemaal kyon nahin karte hai, jo jawaab dete hai
 And this answer has been given by the Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju in the Lok Sabha
 22 disambar 2015 ko lalganj kii saansad neelam sonkar ke sawaal ke jawaab main grih rajya mantri ne kaha ki ''raksha mantralay ne suchit kiya he ki 'shahid' shabd bhartiya sashastr senaaon main kinhin cazcelatiz ke sandarbh main prayukt nahin kiya jaataa
 Similarly, such a term is not used to refer to the death of soldiers of Central Armed Police Forces and Assam Rifles during an action or action
 yahi jawaab 18 farvir 2014 ko purv grih rajya mantri arpyen singh ne loksabhaa main diya tha ki sarkaar ne kabhi shahid shabd ko paribhaashit nahin kiya he
 The ABVP should ask Kiren Rijiju why the word martyr is not used for soldiers who die for the country
 sarkaar or sena apni jaan kii qurbaani dene vaale ko shahid nahin kahati he
 You will get this answer from the Lok Sabha website
 aap print out lekar inhen twit kar sakate hai
 The Indian government does not use the word martyr for soldiers who died on the border
 akhbaar or tivi ko lekar satark ho jaaiye varna is desh kaa bedaa gark karne waalon main aap bhi shaamil honge
 Most of these work has become alive for the sake of government
 gurmeher cor ne jitna bol liya tha utana bol liya he
 People have spoken against him and have also spoken in support
 wo ek chaatra he
 What can be bigger than this, that this first year student has been supported by her teachers
 ladi shriram college ke angrezi vibhaag ke teacheron ne ek bayaan jari kiya he jisamen likhaa he, 'ham ladi shriram college ke angrezi vibhaag ke faikalti member saafataur par or majbooti se apni chaatra gurmeher cor kaa samarthan karte hai
 Supports his right to express his views on university-related issues
 ham shikshakon ke liye ye kaafii santoshjanak he ki usne apane aasapaas bane maahaul par chuppi kaa sahaara lene ke bajaay badi hi samvedansheeltaa, rachanaatmakataa or bahaduree ke saath khud ko vyakt kiya he
 We feel that it is the duty of educational institutions to make their students sensitive and accountable and away from the fear of violent revenge action and develop their capacity for critical thinking
 hamen garv he ki gurmeher ne is desh ke ek yuva naagarik ke taur par apana kartavya nibhaayaa he
 We condemn the threats of violence and vandalism she is receiving
 virendra sahvaag or randeep huda jaise public figures dwaara soshal media par die gaye jawaab us dhamkee or dar kaa sharmnaak rup hai jiskaa saamana gurmeher kar rahi hai, us hinsak bheed kii taraf se jiskaa rup uniwarsity ne haal hi main dekha
 We appeal to the public for understanding
 ham un sansthaanon se bhi samajhadaari kii apil karte hai jinke haath main ye zimmedaari he ki wo kaanoon or nyaay main logon kaa bharosa behaal karen or hamaare yuva nagarikon ke liye bina dare sochane or khud ko vyakt karne kaa maahaul den
 
 
 ' sarkaron ke paas takat bahut hoti he
 When we and you forget this incident, it will find a way out
 gurmeher cor kaa samarthan dene vaale shikshakon ko pareshaan karegi
 Will send notice unke register check karavaaegi
 Many teachers neither speak for themselves nor for their students
 bahut se shikshak is desh main dahez lekar shaadi karte hai or shikshak diwas ke din devtaa banakar ghoomte hai
 For such teachers, i am reading the names of those teachers who have supported Gurmehar
 janet lalwampui, nangoum maheshakanta singh, maitreyi mandal, jonthan vagchz, rachita mittal, shernaz kama, aarti minocha, ruyeesana shrauf, madhu grover, vafaa hamid, reeta joshi, maaya joshi, tania sachdev, mitali mishra, arunima re, dipti nath, karunaa rajeev, tania sachdev
 Be prepared for a story of how the supporting teachers were harassed
 ek teacher ko apni chaatra kaa saath nahin dena chahie to kya karnaa chahie, khaskar tab jab uske kilaaf mantri or saansad bol rahe hon
 On Twitter, he is being threatened with rape and abuses in writing
 maan lijie ki aapaki beti vahaan padhati ho to teacher ko kya karnaa chahie
 In this sense, it is a big deal
 abivipi ne somvaar ko apni taraf se tirangaa yatra kaa aayojan kiya tha
 BJP leader Shaina NC has said that there should be a debate on whoever is in trouble
 hinsa kii koi jagah nahin honi chahie
 ABVP leader Saket Bahuguna has filed a complaint at the Morris Nagar police station
 kaha he ki media ke madhyam se puure desh se or mujhase bhi tivi studio main ye baat kahi he ki kuch log unhen soshal media par jaan se maarane or balaatkaar kii dhamkee de rahe hai
 It is wrong for any citizen of the country to receive such threats
 police ko aise tatwon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kerani chahie
 Unfortunately Gurmehar ji is blaming our organization ABVP but i want to make it clear that none of our liabilities are involved in this
 der se hi sahi, saket bahuguna ne acha kaam kiya he
 Saket should also tell Kiren Rijiju that you should support Gurmehar, protect because she is alone
 bhale hi usne hamaara virodh kiya he
 Still, Saket did as much as he has
 saket ko ab un tasveeron ko dekhnaa chahie jisamen uske sanghathan ke log hinsa karte dikhaaye gaye hai
 If they want, they can remove the members who commit violence
 bhale hi duusare gut ke hinsa karne vaale apane sanghathan main bane rahen magar saket bahuguna ke paas ek shandaar mauka he virodhiyon ko jawaab dene kaa or apane sanghathan ko sandesh dene kaa ki ham hinsa nahin karenge
 It is expected that this talk of Saket Bahuguna will reach the ministers and mps who were looking for those who corrupted Gurmehar's mind
 uske ek saal puraane video ke aadhaar par uski deshbhakti yaa samadh ko chunauti de rahe the
 The representative of any government may dislike the talk of the girls but cannot challenge their understanding or independent thinking
 baharhaal ab gurmeher ne khud ko aage kii kaarywahi se alag karte hue bayaan diya he ki, 'I am separating myself from the campaign
 aap sabhi ko badhai
 Leave me alone mujhe jo kahana tha wo maine kah diya
 One thing that is certain is that now we will think twice before committing violence or threatening someone, and so i was opposed
 ye campan chaatro ke liye he, mere liye nahin
 Participate in large numbers in March, whoever is questioning my courage and bravery
 unke liye kahuungi ki maine zarurat se zyaada himmat dikhaai he
 ' gurmeher cor ne apana kaam kar diya he
 Many girls have voiced with them and even before them
 hamane kuch noujvaan ladakiyon se poocha ki jab wo bolti hai, pehali baar bolti hai yaa baar baar bolti hai to unke aas paas kaa samaaj unke saath kis tarah kaa bartaav karata he
 With what fear does she first liberate herself, and when she is free, how can she speak and which scares someone
 koun hai jo ladakiyon ke bolne par kehete hai ki bahut bolti ho, bologi to dekh lenaa, aaj ke prime time kaa makasad iske jawaab main un ladakiyon ko samaane laana he jo bolti hai, taaki aap unhen dekh saken
 Surely she should not get any benefit due to being a girl, her talk should be opposed on the basis of arguments
 bahes honi chahie lekin jab koi kisi ladki ko chup karaaye to uski baat ke liye na sahi, uski himmat ke liye uskaa saath dena chahie
 Honey, a student of Miranda House, has sent us a video in which she is saying, 'everyone should raise their voice, not me or who will raise their voice
 ' ladakiyon ke liye kitni hidaayat hoti he phir bhi koi na koi aage aati he bolne ke liye
 His family is requested not to be afraid too much
 siddhi kahati hai ki jab bhi unke saath kii ladkiyaan bolne ko hoti hai unhen suraksha kii yaad dilaakar chup kara diya jaataa he
 Who are those people who become a threat when a girl speaks? uski baat kaa virodh kiijie
 Disagree but who are the people who say it, that they say will not be okay
 kya aisi awaz kursi par baithe logon se bhi aa rahi he
 Somewhere you do not support such people who talk about seeing girls when they speak
 samaaj se lekar tamaam sarkaron main aise logon kii kami nahin hai
 Yamini Dixit is one such student who wants to share her speaking experience with you
 yamini uniwarsity main ek aisi jagah ke liye lard rahi he jahaan kisi bhi tarah kaa matbhed baatcheet ke zariye suljhaayaa ja sake
 How the fights took place in Ramjas College, who threw stones, what the police were doing, it is being investigated and there will never be a result
 isliye prime time main hamaara makasad us jhagade ke kaarnon yaa paksh vipaksh main janaa nahin he
 We are trying to see in the context of the controversy over Gurmehar what happens to a girl when she speaks
 wo bolne se pehle khud se kaise ladati he, jab wo bolti he to usase duniya kaise ladati he
 We are talking that the responsibility of ending the fear of violence is as much as abvp's responsibility to AISA, the police and university have the most accountability for both of them
 hamane in ladakiyon se sahmati lee he, unhone bhi himmat dikhaai he ki ve bolne ke halaat par bolengi
 The government will not decide the way of protest in the world
 log tay karenge
 Now see, the Prime Minister started Mann Ki Baat
 iske jawaab main congress ke netaa sandip dikshit ne kaam kii baat shuru kar di
 They also question the Prime Minister about the work through radio and put it on the Internet
 is tarah se loktantr faltaa phulata he
 Different sounds are heard
 in awaazon ke bich hi aap kisi ko pradhanmantri chunate hai or kisi ko nahin chunate hai
 Aditi from Miranda House says, 'I don't belong to any organization
 agar kisi ko kuch pasand nahin tha to unhen shantipurna pradarshan karnaa chahie
 He has many people afraid to write on social media
 ve raajnneeti se bhaagane lage hai
 This is not good for politics
 unhen kyon lagata he ki gaali dene waalon kaa giroh anaap shanaap likhane lagegaa
 Check the profile of your abuser
 dekhiye ki ve kis raajnneetik dal ke samarthak hai
 whatsapp is being spread in the name of information nowadays
 anaap shanaap afvaahen hai
 The whole system is engaged in defaming someone inside
 shaayad inhen sab vajahon se khaskar aam mahilaayein likhane se ghabraati hai
 What kind of things have been written on Gurmehar's post too
 police ne maamla to darj kiya he
 Let's see what happens
 mangalvaar ko dilli vishvavidhyalay main ek march hua
 This march was organized by students and teachers
 isa sanghathan bhi shaamil tha
 In this March, Sarvapriya Sangwan spoke to girls who are not from any organization but came against the politics of violence
 ummid he ki college prashasan aisi bolne vaali ladakiyon ko pareshaan nahin karegaa balki unhen ek patr jari karegaa ki aapane shantipurna pradarshan main hissaa lekar college kaa naam raushan kiya he
 Such a letter should be given to the principal of the college
 abivipi ke sadasyon ko bhi dena chahie or isa waalon ko bhi
 And also those students who are not from any organization like Aditi
 nidikshma sharma ramajas kii chaatra hai
 She says, 'we saw how our university turned into Riot Place
 ye baat rakhane ke liye hoti he
 It is important to protest because they want to scare us
 ' What kind of society are we letting on social media where girls have to think while speaking that there is danger? ghar se niklo to khatara, ghar main rahakar duniya se bolo tab bhi khatara
 When the tongue is not left, the daughters will save for whom
 kya sankhyikee vibhaag or mahila kalyaan vibhaag ke aankadon ke liye bachengi
 There are many girls who are combating these abusive gangs
 aane vaale vakt main unka yogadan yaad kiya jayega
 Remember one thing that abuses
 sarkarein or raajnneetik dal unka istemaal kar chhod denge
 Whatever they write on social media, they can take the name of any leader but in society they will never be able to tell that they write abuses in support of any political party
 logon ko dhamkaate hai
 Pranjal, a student, said, 'at first i did not want to come to this Protest because my parents were very worried
 aisa nahin he ki wo abivipi ko saport karte hai, lekin wo abivipi se darate hai ki kahin wo mujhe kuch na kar den
 Like Pranjal, Sarvapriya got a school student in Delhi University in March
 aditi
 She was with Pranjal
 aditi ne kaha ki dar unka hathiyaar ho gaya he or ladakiyon ke liye virodh karnaa zyaada zaruri he kyonki unhen bolaa jaataa he ki tum kamazor ho
 The comments duniya main tarah tarah ke virodh pradarshan ho rahe hai
 What a tremendous movement in India for the entry of women into the Haji Ali Dargah and the Shani Temple
 mahilaon ne yah andolan chalaaya
 Not to take votes in the name of your question but to change the society
 aapako nikita azaad yaad he
 Nikita of Patiala started the napkin movement alone
 nikita ne sabarimala mandir ke trustee ko patr likh diya ki main bees saal kii ladki hum, mere aankh, kaan, naak, hont, haath, paanv sab hai jaise duusare insaanon ke hai
 i am a woman who has menstruation
 maine maa ko kehete suna he ki aise samay main mandiron main nahin janaa chahie
 a woman is impure
 nikita ke is patr ne desh main hangaamaa machaa diya jisamen usne sabarimala waalon se poocha tha ki maahvaaree ke samay auraton ko mandir aane se kyon roka ja rahaa he
 He raised this question alone
 congress bijepi ke manch se nahin uthaaya
 The breath of the leaders of these parties will swell
 isliye zaruri he ki koi akele bhi awaz uthaae
 When someone does this, then we support
 awaz uthaane vaale se sawaal bhi karen
 Nikita was also questioned but it is not right to scare her
 ladkiyaan awaz uthaa rahi hai
 Do not support those who kill them in private or in the crowd for any reason
 ho saktaa he ki bheed ke paas sabase sahi tark hon, kaaran hon magar wo adaalat nahin he
 That is not the law
 sahi baat ke liye sadak par faisla karne kaa adhikaar uske paas nahin he
 This is not the case with the syllabus of chemistry
 aam zindagi ke silebus main he
 Can understand without going to school
 gandhi kaa sabase bada yogadan kya tha
 He freed the common people from the fear that armed with sticks and could resist the British rule, which had been in existence for 200 years
 bina dare
 Whatever comes out of this basic fear, the society and the government get scared
 aap twitor par jaakar dekhiye, gurmeher ke khilaaf kis bhashaa kaa istamaal kiya gaya he
 This is because some girl kept silent after seeing the government police
 bole nahin
 But the girl turned out to be a bit stubborn and said that she is not afraid
 ab usne kaha he ki use jitna awaz uthaanaa tha uthaa liya, ab wo chup rahegi
 What has been said is correct
 wo dari nahin he, usne ab aap par daal diya he ki aap ek akeli ladki ke saath khadey ho sakate hai to khadey hokar dikhaaiye
 There are some Ram sahibs who are against the war between India and Pakistan
 shanti ko protsaahit karte hai
 They put such messages in youtube
 28 april 2016 ko unheen ke liye gurmeher ne hindi or angrezi main ye video daalaa tha
 Gurmehar Kaur is telling in this video that when she was two years old, her father was martyred, when she was six years old, she even tried to kill a burqewali because she thought she was the one responsible for my father's death
 tab uski maa ne samajhaayaa ki pakistan ne nahin mere pita ko jang ne maaraa he
 He wrote that he learned to forget hatred
 yah aasaan nahin tha lekin bahut mushkil bhi nahin
 If i can do it, you can too
 aaj main bhi apane pita kii tarah hi ek sainik hum
 i fight for peace between India and Pakistan because if there had not been a war, my father would have been with me today
 duniya yuddh ke kilaaf bolti he
 Everyone knows that war is the enemy of humanity so that's why leaders from smallpox to big talk talk about peace

 ' ladakiyon ke liye kitni hidaayat hoti he phir bhi koi na koi aage aati he bolne ke liye
 His family is requested not to be afraid too much
 siddhi kahati hai ki jab bhi unke saath kii ladkiyaan bolne ko hoti hai unhen suraksha kii yaad dilaakar chup kara diya jaataa he
 Who are those people who become a threat when a girl speaks? uski baat kaa virodh kiijie
 Disagree but who are the people who say it, that they say will not be okay
 kya aisi awaz kursi par baithe logon se bhi aa rahi he
 Somewhere you do not support such people who talk about seeing girls when they speak
 samaaj se lekar tamaam sarkaron main aise logon kii kami nahin hai
 Yamini Dixit is one such student who wants to share her speaking experience with you
 yamini uniwarsity main ek aisi jagah ke liye lard rahi he jahaan kisi bhi tarah kaa matbhed baatcheet ke zariye suljhaayaa ja sake
 How the fights took place in Ramjas College, who threw stones, what the police were doing, it is being investigated and there will never be a result
 isliye prime time main hamaara makasad us jhagade ke kaarnon yaa paksh vipaksh main janaa nahin he
 We are trying to see in the context of the controversy over Gurmehar what happens to a girl when she speaks
 wo bolne se pehle khud se kaise ladati he, jab wo bolti he to usase duniya kaise ladati he
 We are talking that the responsibility of ending the fear of violence is as much as abvp's responsibility to AISA, the police and university have the most accountability for both of them
 hamane in ladakiyon se sahmati lee he, unhone bhi himmat dikhaai he ki ve bolne ke halaat par bolengi
 The government will not decide the way of protest in the world
 log tay karenge
 Now see, the Prime Minister started Mann Ki Baat
 iske jawaab main congress ke netaa sandip dikshit ne kaam kii baat shuru kar di
 They also question the Prime Minister about the work through radio and put it on the Internet
 is tarah se loktantr faltaa phulata he
 Different sounds are heard
 in awaazon ke bich hi aap kisi ko pradhanmantri chunate hai or kisi ko nahin chunate hai
 Aditi from Miranda House says, 'I don't belong to any organization
 agar kisi ko kuch pasand nahin tha to unhen shantipurna pradarshan karnaa chahie
 He has many people afraid to write on social media
 ve raajnneeti se bhaagane lage hai
 This is not good for politics
 unhen kyon lagata he ki gaali dene waalon kaa giroh anaap shanaap likhane lagegaa
 Check the profile of your abuser
 dekhiye ki ve kis raajnneetik dal ke samarthak hai
 whatsapp is being spread in the name of information nowadays
 anaap shanaap afvaahen hai
 The whole system is engaged in defaming someone inside
 shaayad inhen sab vajahon se khaskar aam mahilaayein likhane se ghabraati hai
 What kind of things have been written on Gurmehar's post too
 police ne maamla to darj kiya he
 Let's see what happens
 mangalvaar ko dilli vishvavidhyalay main ek march hua
 This march was organized by students and teachers
 isa sanghathan bhi shaamil tha
 In this March, Sarvapriya Sangwan spoke to girls who are not from any organization but came against the politics of violence
 ummid he ki college prashasan aisi bolne vaali ladakiyon ko pareshaan nahin karegaa balki unhen ek patr jari karegaa ki aapane shantipurna pradarshan main hissaa lekar college kaa naam raushan kiya he
 Such a letter should be given to the principal of the college
 abivipi ke sadasyon ko bhi dena chahie or isa waalon ko bhi
 And also those students who are not from any organization like Aditi
 nidikshma sharma ramajas kii chaatra hai
 She says, 'we saw how our university turned into Riot Place
 ye baat rakhane ke liye hoti he
 It is important to protest because they want to scare us
 ' What kind of society are we letting on social media where girls have to think while speaking that there is danger? ghar se niklo to khatara, ghar main rahakar duniya se bolo tab bhi khatara
 When the tongue is not left, the daughters will save for whom
 kya sankhyikee vibhaag or mahila kalyaan vibhaag ke aankadon ke liye bachengi
 There are many girls who are combating these abusive gangs
 aane vaale vakt main unka yogadan yaad kiya jayega
 Remember one thing that abuses
 sarkarein or raajnneetik dal unka istemaal kar chhod denge
 Whatever they write on social media, they can take the name of any leader but in society they will never be able to tell that they write abuses in support of any political party
 logon ko dhamkaate hai
 Pranjal, a student, said, 'at first i did not want to come to this Protest because my parents were very worried
 aisa nahin he ki wo abivipi ko saport karte hai, lekin wo abivipi se darate hai ki kahin wo mujhe kuch na kar den
 Like Pranjal, Sarvapriya got a school student in Delhi University in March
 aditi
 She was with Pranjal
 aditi ne kaha ki dar unka hathiyaar ho gaya he or ladakiyon ke liye virodh karnaa zyaada zaruri he kyonki unhen bolaa jaataa he ki tum kamazor ho
 The comments duniya main tarah tarah ke virodh pradarshan ho rahe hai
 What a tremendous movement in India for the entry of women into the Haji Ali Dargah and the Shani Temple
 mahilaon ne yah andolan chalaaya
 Not to take votes in the name of your question but to change the society
 aapako nikita azaad yaad he
 Nikita of Patiala started the napkin movement alone
 nikita ne sabarimala mandir ke trustee ko patr likh diya ki main bees saal kii ladki hum, mere aankh, kaan, naak, hont, haath, paanv sab hai jaise duusare insaanon ke hai
 i am a woman who has menstruation
 maine maa ko kehete suna he ki aise samay main mandiron main nahin janaa chahie
 a woman is impure
 nikita ke is patr ne desh main hangaamaa machaa diya jisamen usne sabarimala waalon se poocha tha ki maahvaaree ke samay auraton ko mandir aane se kyon roka ja rahaa he
 He raised this question alone
 congress bijepi ke manch se nahin uthaaya
 The breath of the leaders of these parties will swell
 isliye zaruri he ki koi akele bhi awaz uthaae
 When someone does this, then we support
 awaz uthaane vaale se sawaal bhi karen
 Nikita was also questioned but it is not right to scare her
 ladkiyaan awaz uthaa rahi hai
 Do not support those who kill them in private or in the crowd for any reason
 ho saktaa he ki bheed ke paas sabase sahi tark hon, kaaran hon magar wo adaalat nahin he
 That is not the law
 sahi baat ke liye sadak par faisla karne kaa adhikaar uske paas nahin he
 This is not the case with the syllabus of chemistry
 aam zindagi ke silebus main he
 Can understand without going to school
 gurmeher cor is video main bataa rahi hai ki jab wo do saal kii thi to uske pita shahid ho gaye, chah saal kii thi to ek burkevali ko maarane kaa bhi prayaas kiya kyonki use lagata tha ki mere pita kii maut kii zimmedaar vahi he
 His mother then explained that my father was killed by war, not by Pakistan
 usne yahi likhaa ki nafrat ko bhoolanaa sikh liya
 It was not easy but not too difficult
 agar main aisa kar sakati hum to aap bhi kar sakate hai
 Today i am a soldier just like my father
 main bharat or pakistan ke bich shanti ke liye ladati hum kyonki agar yuddh nahin hua hota to mere pita aaj mere paas hote
 The world speaks against war
 sabko pataa he ki yuddh insaaniyat kaa dushman he isliye chhutbhaiya se lekar bade netaa shanti kii baat karte hai
 When Gurmehar put this video on youtube, a young Pakistani man Faiyaz Khan supported him
 abhi tak aapane mitra desh suna hoga, shatru desh suna hoga, faiyaaz khan ne gurmeher cor ke saath ek nae desh kii kalpana pesh kii
 Sibling country means siblings' country
 ham zindagi main isliye aate hai nayaa or kuubasurat sochane
 Fayyaz Khan lives in Australia
 6 may 2016 ko ye video you tub par daalaa
 There is some Ram sahib who runs a movement on You Tube to encourage peace between India and Pakistan
 usee video main faiyaz kehete hai
 
 
 Hi Gurmehar Kaur, i am Fayaz Khan from Pakistan
 jab main pehali baar australia aayaa to sabhi bharatiyon ko vaise dekhtaa tha jaise mujhe skool main sikhaaya gaya tha
 But soon we started eating in the class room, sharing chairs as if we were close friends
 kargil yuddh main tumhaare pita kii maut par ham sabhi ko afsos he
 i have seen war, have seen deaths in my hometown of Swat but have not lost any member of my house by luck, but i have thousands of Gurmehar Kaur around me
 main bharat aana chahta hum bina kisi viza kii pabandi kii
 We will fight together against these restrictions
 seemaa ke donon taraf hazaron logon ko gurmeher cor kii tarah takalifon se guzaranaa na pade, ham iske liye ladenge
 i cannot give you the love of your father, but of course you have got a brother from the enemy country
 chalo is duniya main ek anokhaa rishta banaate hai jahaan bhai ek musalmaan he or bahan ek sikh
 Now this enemy country replaces the word with Sibling country
 matlab bhai bahan kaa desh kar dete hai
 This effect was from Gurmehar's video
 gurmeher cor ke video ke khilaaf bhi kai video aa rahe hai
 He is also being criticized
 hamaara focus is baat par he jab koi akeli ladki bolti he to kya hota he
 Go to Twitter and submit the abuses given to Gurmehar Kaur
 nari devi he ke naam par nautanki karne vaale samaaj kii pole khul jaaegi
 What is the point, Gurmehar Kaur posted the video that she is not afraid of ABVP
 magar use kinare karne ke liye ek saal purana video nikaala gaya or is tarah pesh kiya gaya jaise wo pakistan ke khilaaf ladate hue maare gaye sainikon kii qurbaani ko chota kar rahi he
 Is using her father
 dhundne waalon ko usee you-tub par yahi video mila hoga lekin unhone aap tak yah baat nahin failaai kyonki koshish he ki aap rashtrawaad ke naam par sankate rahen
 Keep giving the feeling of violence inside you a chance
 gurmeher ke post ne jo hasil kiya wo hazaar mixilon se bhi duniya main ajtak kahin bhi hasil nahin ho sakaa he
 Sibling Country
 bhai bahan kaa desh
 We did not use the word martyr
 ham nahin karte hai
 You ask why we do not use martyrs, who answer
 or ye jawaab grih rajya mantri kiren rijiju ne loksabhaa main diya he
 In reply to the question of Lalganj MP Neelam Sonkar on 22 December 2015, the Minister of State for Home Affairs said that "the Ministry of Defense has informed that the word 'martyr' is not used in the context of any casualties in the Indian Armed Forces
" isi prakaar kisi kaary yaa kaarywahi ke dauraan kendriya sashastr police balon or assam rifles ke javaanon kii mrityu ho jane ke sandarbh main bhi aisa shabd prayukt nahin hota he
 The same answer was given by former Minister of State for Home RPN Singh in Lok Sabha on 18 February 2014 that the government has never defined the term martyr
 abivipi ko kiren rijiju se poochna chahie ki desh ke liye jaan dene vaale sainikon ke liye shahid shabd kaa istemaal kyon nahin hota he
 The government and the military do not call those who sacrificed their lives a martyr
 yah jawaab aapako loksabhaa kii website se mil jaayenge
 You can take a print out and tweet them
 bharat sarkaar seemaa par jaan dene vaale sainikon ke liye shahid shabd kaa istemaal nahin karti he
 Be cautious about newspapers and TV or else you will be among those who grumble the fleet of this country
 inamen se zyaadaatar kaa kaam hukumat ke liye zindaabad bolnaa ho gaya he
 Gurmehar Kaur has spoken as much as she spoke
 uske virodh main log bole to samarthan main bhi bole hai
 She is a student isse badi baat kya ho sakati he ki pratham varsh kii is chaatra kaa saath uske shikshakon ne diya he
 Teachers in the English Department of Lady Shri Ram College have issued a statement which states, 'we are a faculty member of the English Department of Lady Shri Ram College, clearly and strongly supporting our student Gurmehar Kaur
 uniwarsity se jude muddon par apane vichaaron ko rakhane ke uske adhikaar kaa samarthan karte hai
 It is quite satisfying for us teachers that they have expressed themselves with great sensitivity, creativity and bravery rather than resorting to silence on the environment around them
 hamen lagata he ki shiksha sansthaanon kaa ye kartavya he ki wo apane chaatro ko hinsaatmak badale kii karrwai ke dar se dur unhen samvedansheel or javabdeh banaaen or unamem aalochanatmak chintan kii kshamta viksit karen
 We are proud that Gurmehar has performed his duty as a young citizen of this country
 use mil rahi hinsa or barbarta kii dhamkiyon kii ham ninda karte hai
 Social media responses by public figures such as Virender Sehwag and Randeep Hooda are shameful forms of intimidation and fear that Gurmehar is facing, towards the violent mob that the university has recently witnessed
 ham janata se samajhadaari kii apil karte hai
 We also appeal to those institutions that have the responsibility to restore people's trust in law and justice and provide an environment for our young citizens to think fearlessly and express themselves
 
 
 ' Governments have a lot of power
 ham or aap jab is ghatana ko bhul jaayenge to wo koi tarika nikaalegi
 The teachers supporting Gurmehar Kaur will harass her
 notice bhejegi
 They will get their register checked
 bahut se shikshak na to apane liye bol pate hai na apane chaatr ke liye
 Many teachers marry in this country with dowry and roam on the day of the teacher as deities
 aise shikshakon ke liye main un shikshakon kaa naam pard rahaa hum jinhone gurmeher kaa saath diya he
 Janet Lalwampui, Nangoum Maheshakanta Singh, Maitreyi Mandal, Johnathan Vagchaz, Rachita Mittal, Shernaz Cama, Aarti Minocha, Rukhsana Shroff, Madhu Grover, Wafa Hamid, Rita Joshi, Maya Joshi, Tania Sachdev, Mitali Mishra, Arunima Ray, Dipti Kar Rajeev, Tania Sachdev
 aisi story ke liye taiyaar rahiye ki samarthan karne vaale teacheron ko kaise pareshaan kiya gaya
 What should a teacher do to not support her student, especially when the minister and MP are speaking against her
 twitor par use balaatkaar karne kii dhamkiyaan di ja rahi hon or likhakar gaaliyaan di ja rahi hon
 Suppose your daughter studies there, what should the teacher do
 is lihaaz se ye badi baat he
 The ABVP organized a tricolor trip on its behalf on Monday
 bijepi netaa shina ensi ne kaha he ki jise bhi pareshaani he use lekar bahes honi chahie
 There should be no place for violence
 abivipi ke netaa saket bahuguna ne morris nagar thane main shikaayat darj karai he
 It has been said that through the media from all over the country and also in TV studios, it has been said that some people are threatening to kill and rape them on social media
 desh ke kisi bhi naagarik ko aisi dhamkiyaan milanaa galat he
 The police should take strong action against such elements
 durbhaagya se gurmeher ji hamaare sanghathan abivipi par aarope laga rahi hai lekin main saaf karnaa chahta hum ki hamaara koi bhi daayitvadharee isamen shaamil nahin he
 As of late, Saket Bahuguna has done a good job
 saket ko kiren rijiju se bhi kahana chahie ki aap gurmeher kaa saath dijie, suraksha kiijie kyonki wo akeli he
 Even though he has opposed us
 phir bhi jitna uske bas main he utana to saket ne kiya hi
 Saket should now look at the pictures in which the people of his organization are shown committing violence
 wo chahen to hinsa karne vaale sadasyon ko nikaal sakate hai
 Even though the violence of the other factions remains in their organization, Saket Bahuguna has a great chance to respond to the opponents and send a message to his organization that we will not commit violence
 ummid he saket bahuguna kii yah baat mantriyon or saansadon tak pahonchegi jo gurmeher ke dimaag ko dooshit karne waalon kaa pataa laga rahe the
 Based on his one year old video, he was challenging his patriotism
 kisi bhi sarkaar kaa numaayinda ladakiyon kii baat ko bhale naapsand kare magar uski samaj yaa swatantra soch ko chunauti nahin de saktaa he
 However, now Gurmehar has made a statement separating himself from further proceedings, 'main campan se khud ko alag kar rahi hum
 Congratulations to all of you
 mujhe akelaa chhod den
 i said what i had to say
 ek cheez jo nishchit he ki ab ham hinsa karne yaa kisi ko dhamkee dene se pehle do baar sochenge, or isliye meraa virodh tha
 This campaign is for students, not for me
 march main badi sankhya main hissaa len jo koi bhi mere saahas or bahaduree par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 i will say to them that i have shown more courage than i have
 ' Gurmehar Kaur has done her work
 unke saath or unke pehle bhi bahut si ladakiyon ne awaz uthaai he
 We asked some young girls how the society around them treats them when they speak, for the first time or they speak again and again
 ve pehle kis dar se khud ko azaad karti hai or jab azaad hoti hai to unka bolnaa kis tarah se or kis kis ko daraa detaa he
 Who are the girls who say that they speak a lot, if you speak, then see, the purpose of today's prime time is to bring the girls who speak in response, so that you can see them
 zarur ladki hone ke kaaran use koi phayda nahin milanaa chahie, uski baat kaa tarkon ke aadhaar virodh hona chahie
 There should be debate, but when someone silences a girl, it should not be right for her to speak, to support her for her courage
 miranda house kii chaatra hani ne ek video hamen bheja he jisamen wo kah rahi hai, 'sabko awaz uthaani chahie, main nahin ham nahin to koun awaz uthayega
 'there is so much instruction for girls, yet someone comes forward to speak
 inaki parivaar waalon se guzarish he ki itnaa bhi na daren
 Siddhi says that whenever girls accompanying her are to speak, they are reminded of safety and kept silent
 wo koun log hai jo ladki ke bolne par khatara ban jate hai
 Resist his point
 asahmat hoiye lekin use yah bolne vaale koun log hote hai jo kehete hai ki thik nahin hoga
 Is such a voice coming from people sitting in a chair
 kahin aap aise logon kaa samarthan to nahin karte jo ladakiyon ke bolne par dekh lene kii baat karte hai
 There is no dearth of such people from society to all governments
 yamini dikshit aisi hi ek chaatra hai jo bolne ke apane anubhav ko aapse saajha karnaa chaahati hai
 Yamini is fighting for a place in the university where any kind of differences can be resolved through dialogue
 ramajas college main jhagade kaise hue, pathar kisne phenke, police kya kar rahi thi, isaki jaanch ho rahi he or kabhi nateeja nahin aayega
 So in prime time our motive is not to go into the reasons or side opposition to that quarrel
 ham gurmeher ko lekar hue vivaad ke sandarbh main dekhne kii koshish kar rahe hai ki jab koi ladki bolti he to uske saath kya kya hota he
 How does she fight herself before speaking, how does the world fight her when she speaks
 ham baat kar rahe hai ki hinsa kaa dar samaapt karne kii zimmedaari jitna abivipi kii he utani hi isa kii he, in donon se sabase adhik javabdehi police or uniwarsity kii he
 We have taken consent from these girls, they have also shown courage that they will speak on the situation of speaking
 duniya main virodh kaa tarika sarkaar nahin tay karegi
 People will decide
 ab dekhiye pradhanmantri ne man kii baat shuru kii
 In response, Congress leader Sandeep Dixit started talking about work
 ve bhi radio ke zariye kaam kii baat main pradhanmantri se sawaal karte hai or internet par daal dete hai
 This is how democracy thrives
 tarah tarah kii awaazen sunai detii hai
 Between these voices, you choose someone as Prime Minister and you do not choose anyone
 miranda house kii aditi kahati hai, 'main kisi sanghathan kii nahin hum
 If someone did not like something, they should have a peaceful demonstration
 unke paas soshal media par bahut se log likhane se darate hai
 They are running away from politics
 yah raajnneeti ke liye acha nahin he
 Why do they think that the gang of abusers will start writing anonymously
 aap gaali dene waalon kii profile check kiijie
 See which political party they are supporters of
 whatsap aajkal soochna ke naam par kachra failaayaa ja rahaa he
 There are rumors of anonymity
 puraa tantra laga hua he kisi ko bheetar bheetar badnaam karne main
 Probably for all these reasons especially ordinary women are afraid to write
 gurmeher ke post par bhi kisi kisi baaten likhi gai hai
 The police has registered a case
 dekhte hai kya hota he
 On Tuesday, a march took place at Delhi University
 is march kaa aayojan chaatr or shikshakon ne kiya tha
 The AISA organization was also involved
 is march main sarvapriya sangwan ne un ladakiyon se baat kii jo kisi sanghathan kii to nahin hai magar hinsa kii raajnneeti ke virodh main ain thim
 Hopefully the college administration will not disturb such speaking girls but will issue a letter to them that you have brightened the name of the college by participating in a peaceful demonstration
 aisa patr college ke principal ko dena chahie
 It should be given to the members of ABVP and also to the people of AISA
 or un chaatro ko bhi jo kisi sanghathan se nahin hai jaise aditi
 Nidikshma Sharma is a student of Ramjas
 wo kahati hai, 'hamane dekha ki kaise hamaari uniwarsity rit place main badal gai
 This thing is meant to be kept
 virodh karnaa zaruri he kyonki wo hamen daraana chaahate hai
 ' soshal media par ham kaisaa samaaj banane de rahe hai jahaan ladakiyon ko bolte vakt sochna pade ki khatara to nahin he
 If you come out of the house then there is danger, stay at home and speak to the world even then there is danger jab jubaan hi nahin bachegi to betiyaan kiske liye bachengi
 Will the statistics department and women's welfare department survive for data
 bahut si ladkiyaan hai jo in gaali dene vaale girohon kaa muqabla kar rahi hai
 His contribution will be remembered in times to come
 gaali dene vaale ek baat yaad rakhen
 Governments and political parties will quit using them
 ve soshal media main chaahe jo likh len, jis bhi netaa kaa naam le len magar samaaj main kabhi nahin bataa sakenge ki ve kisi raajnneetik dal ke samarthan main gaaliyaan likhte hai
 Threaten people
 ek chaatra pranjal ne kaha, 'pehle main is protest main aana nahin chaahati thi kyonki mere parent bahut chintit the
 It is not that they support ABVP, but they are afraid of ABVP not to do anything to me
 pranjal kii tarah hi sarvapriya ko dilli vishvavidhyalay ke march main skool kii ek chaatra mili
 Aditi wo pranjal ke saath hi thi
 Aditi said that fear has become her weapon and it is more important for girls to protest because they are told that you are weak
 tippaniyan Various types of protests are taking place in the world
 bharat main hi haazi ali dargah or shani mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh ko lekar kitna jabardast andolan hua
 Women started this movement
 apane sawaal ke naam par vot lene ke liye nahin balki samaaj ko badalane ke liye
 You remember Nikita Azad
 patiala kii nikita ne akele napkin andolan kii shuruyaat kar di
 Nikita wrote a letter to the trustee of the Sabarimala temple that i am a twenty year old girl, my eyes, ears, nose, lips, hands, feet are all like other human beings
 main ek aurat hum jise maahvaaree hoti he
 i have heard mother say that one should not go to temples at such times
 aurat apavitra hoti he
 This letter from Nikita created uproar in the country in which she asked the Sabarimala people why women are being prevented from coming to the temple during menstruation
 yah sawaal usne akele uthaaya
 Congress did not lift from bjp's platform
 in dalon ke netaaon kii saansen phool jaaengi
 So it is important that someone should raise their voice alone
 jab koi aisa kare to ham saath den
 Also ask a voice person
 nikita se bhi sawaal hue magar use sawaal karne ke liye daraana thik nahin he
 Girls are raising their voices
 inhen akele main yaa bheed main kisi bhi kaaran se maarane waalon ko dhamkaane waalon kaa saath mat dijie
 It may be that the crowd has the right arguments, reasons, but it is not the court
 wo kanoon nahin he
 He does not have the right to decide on the road for the right thing
 yah baat chemistry ke silebus kaa nahin he
 Is in the syllabus of common life
 bina skool gaye samaj main aa sakati he
 The world speaks against war
 sabko pataa he ki yuddh insaaniyat kaa dushman he isliye chhutbhaiya se lekar bade netaa shanti kii baat karte hai
 When Gurmehar put this video on youtube, a young Pakistani man Faiyaz Khan supported him
 abhi tak aapane mitra desh suna hoga, shatru desh suna hoga, faiyaaz khan ne gurmeher cor ke saath ek nae desh kii kalpana pesh kii
 Sibling country means siblings' country
 ham zindagi main isliye aate hai nayaa or kuubasurat sochane
 Fayyaz Khan lives in Australia
 6 may 2016 ko ye video you tub par daalaa
 There is some Ram sahib who runs a movement on You Tube to encourage peace between India and Pakistan
 usee video main faiyaz kehete hai
 
 
 Hi Gurmehar Kaur, i am Fayaz Khan from Pakistan
 jab main pehali baar australia aayaa to sabhi bharatiyon ko vaise dekhtaa tha jaise mujhe skool main sikhaaya gaya tha
 But soon we started eating in the class room, sharing chairs as if we were close friends
 kargil yuddh main tumhaare pita kii maut par ham sabhi ko afsos he
 i have seen war, have seen deaths in my hometown of Swat but have not lost any member of my house by luck, but i have thousands of Gurmehar Kaur around me
 main bharat aana chahta hum bina kisi viza kii pabandi kii
 We will fight together against these restrictions
 seemaa ke donon taraf hazaron logon ko gurmeher cor kii tarah takalifon se guzaranaa na pade, ham iske liye ladenge
 i cannot give you the love of your father, but of course you have got a brother from the enemy country
 chalo is duniya main ek anokhaa rishta banaate hai jahaan bhai ek musalmaan he or bahan ek sikh
 Now this enemy country replaces the word with Sibling country
 matlab bhai bahan kaa desh kar dete hai
 This effect was from Gurmehar's video
 gurmeher cor ke video ke khilaaf bhi kai video aa rahe hai
 He is also being criticized
 hamaara focus is baat par he jab koi akeli ladki bolti he to kya hota he
 Go to Twitter and submit the abuses given to Gurmehar Kaur
 nari devi he ke naam par nautanki karne vaale samaaj kii pole khul jaaegi
 What is the point, Gurmehar Kaur posted the video that she is not afraid of ABVP
 magar use kinare karne ke liye ek saal purana video nikaala gaya or is tarah pesh kiya gaya jaise wo pakistan ke khilaaf ladate hue maare gaye sainikon kii qurbaani ko chota kar rahi he
 Is using her father
 dhundne waalon ko usee you-tub par yahi video mila hoga lekin unhone aap tak yah baat nahin failaai kyonki koshish he ki aap rashtrawaad ke naam par sankate rahen
 Keep giving the feeling of violence inside you a chance
 gurmeher ke post ne jo hasil kiya wo hazaar mixilon se bhi duniya main ajtak kahin bhi hasil nahin ho sakaa he
 Sibling Country
 bhai bahan kaa desh
 We did not use the word martyr

 yah jawaab aapako loksabhaa kii website se mil jaayenge
 You can take a print out and tweet them
 bharat sarkaar seemaa par jaan dene vaale sainikon ke liye shahid shabd kaa istemaal nahin karti he
 Be cautious about newspapers and TV or else you will be among those who grumble the fleet of this country
 inamen se zyaadaatar kaa kaam hukumat ke liye zindaabad bolnaa ho gaya he
 Gurmehar Kaur has spoken as much as she spoke
 uske virodh main log bole to samarthan main bhi bole hai
 She is a student isse badi baat kya ho sakati he ki pratham varsh kii is chaatra kaa saath uske shikshakon ne diya he
 Teachers in the English Department of Lady Shri Ram College have issued a statement which states, 'we are a faculty member of the English Department of Lady Shri Ram College, clearly and strongly supporting our student Gurmehar Kaur
 uniwarsity se jude muddon par apane vichaaron ko rakhane ke uske adhikaar kaa samarthan karte hai
 It is quite satisfying for us teachers that they have expressed themselves with great sensitivity, creativity and bravery rather than resorting to silence on the environment around them
 hamen lagata he ki shiksha sansthaanon kaa ye kartavya he ki wo apane chaatro ko hinsaatmak badale kii karrwai ke dar se dur unhen samvedansheel or javabdeh banaaen or unamem aalochanatmak chintan kii kshamta viksit karen
 We are proud that Gurmehar has performed his duty as a young citizen of this country
 use mil rahi hinsa or barbarta kii dhamkiyon kii ham ninda karte hai
 Social media responses by public figures such as Virender Sehwag and Randeep Hooda are shameful forms of intimidation and fear that Gurmehar is facing, towards the violent mob that the university has recently witnessed
 ham janata se samajhadaari kii apil karte hai
 We also appeal to those institutions that have the responsibility to restore people's trust in law and justice and provide an environment for our young citizens to think fearlessly and express themselves
 
 
 ' Governments have a lot of power
 ham or aap jab is ghatana ko bhul jaayenge to wo koi tarika nikaalegi
 The teachers supporting Gurmehar Kaur will harass her
 notice bhejegi
 They will get their register checked
 bahut se shikshak na to apane liye bol pate hai na apane chaatr ke liye
 Many teachers marry in this country with dowry and roam on the day of the teacher as deities
 aise shikshakon ke liye main un shikshakon kaa naam pard rahaa hum jinhone gurmeher kaa saath diya he
 Janet Lalwampui, Nangoum Maheshakanta Singh, Maitreyi Mandal, Johnathan Vagchaz, Rachita Mittal, Shernaz Cama, Aarti Minocha, Rukhsana Shroff, Madhu Grover, Wafa Hamid, Rita Joshi, Maya Joshi, Tania Sachdev, Mitali Mishra, Arunima Ray, Dipti Kar Rajeev, Tania Sachdev
 aisi story ke liye taiyaar rahiye ki samarthan karne vaale teacheron ko kaise pareshaan kiya gaya
 What should a teacher do to not support her student, especially when the minister and MP are speaking against her
 twitor par use balaatkaar karne kii dhamkiyaan di ja rahi hon or likhakar gaaliyaan di ja rahi hon
 Suppose your daughter studies there, what should the teacher do
 is lihaaz se ye badi baat he
 The ABVP organized a tricolor trip on its behalf on Monday
 bijepi netaa shina ensi ne kaha he ki jise bhi pareshaani he use lekar bahes honi chahie
 There should be no place for violence
 abivipi ke netaa saket bahuguna ne morris nagar thane main shikaayat darj karai he
 It has been said that through the media from all over the country and also in TV studios, it has been said that some people are threatening to kill and rape them on social media
 desh ke kisi bhi naagarik ko aisi dhamkiyaan milanaa galat he
 The police should take strong action against such elements
 durbhaagya se gurmeher ji hamaare sanghathan abivipi par aarope laga rahi hai lekin main saaf karnaa chahta hum ki hamaara koi bhi daayitvadharee isamen shaamil nahin he
 As of late, Saket Bahuguna has done a good job
 saket ko kiren rijiju se bhi kahana chahie ki aap gurmeher kaa saath dijie, suraksha kiijie kyonki wo akeli he
 Even though he has opposed us
 phir bhi jitna uske bas main he utana to saket ne kiya hi
 Saket should now look at the pictures in which the people of his organization are shown committing violence
 wo chahen to hinsa karne vaale sadasyon ko nikaal sakate hai
 Even though the violence of the other factions remains in their organization, Saket Bahuguna has a great chance to respond to the opponents and send a message to his organization that we will not commit violence
 ummid he saket bahuguna kii yah baat mantriyon or saansadon tak pahonchegi jo gurmeher ke dimaag ko dooshit karne waalon kaa pataa laga rahe the
 Based on his one year old video, he was challenging his patriotism
 kisi bhi sarkaar kaa numaayinda ladakiyon kii baat ko bhale naapsand kare magar uski samaj yaa swatantra soch ko chunauti nahin de saktaa he
 However, now Gurmehar has made a statement separating himself from further proceedings, 'main campan se khud ko alag kar rahi hum
 Congratulations to all of you
 mujhe akelaa chhod den
 i said what i had to say
 ek cheez jo nishchit he ki ab ham hinsa karne yaa kisi ko dhamkee dene se pehle do baar sochenge, or isliye meraa virodh tha
 This campaign is for students, not for me
 march main badi sankhya main hissaa len jo koi bhi mere saahas or bahaduree par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 i will say to them that i have shown more courage than i have
 ' Gurmehar Kaur has done her work
 unke saath or unke pehle bhi bahut si ladakiyon ne awaz uthaai he
 We asked some young girls how the society around them treats them when they speak, for the first time or they speak again and again
 ve pehle kis dar se khud ko azaad karti hai or jab azaad hoti hai to unka bolnaa kis tarah se or kis kis ko daraa detaa he
 Who are the girls who say that they speak a lot, if you speak, then see, the purpose of today's prime time is to bring the girls who speak in response, so that you can see them
 zarur ladki hone ke kaaran use koi phayda nahin milanaa chahie, uski baat kaa tarkon ke aadhaar virodh hona chahie
 There should be debate, but when someone silences a girl, it should not be right for her to speak, to support her for her courage
 miranda house kii chaatra hani ne ek video hamen bheja he jisamen wo kah rahi hai, 'sabko awaz uthaani chahie, main nahin ham nahin to koun awaz uthayega
 'there is so much instruction for girls, yet someone comes forward to speak
 inaki parivaar waalon se guzarish he ki itnaa bhi na daren
 Siddhi says that whenever girls accompanying her are to speak, they are reminded of safety and kept silent
 wo koun log hai jo ladki ke bolne par khatara ban jate hai
 Resist his point
 asahmat hoiye lekin use yah bolne vaale koun log hote hai jo kehete hai ki thik nahin hoga
 Is such a voice coming from people sitting in a chair
 kahin aap aise logon kaa samarthan to nahin karte jo ladakiyon ke bolne par dekh lene kii baat karte hai
 There is no dearth of such people from society to all governments
 yamini dikshit aisi hi ek chaatra hai jo bolne ke apane anubhav ko aapse saajha karnaa chaahati hai
 Yamini is fighting for a place in the university where any kind of differences can be resolved through dialogue
 ramajas college main jhagade kaise hue, pathar kisne phenke, police kya kar rahi thi, isaki jaanch ho rahi he or kabhi nateeja nahin aayega
 So in prime time our motive is not to go into the reasons or side opposition to that quarrel
 ham gurmeher ko lekar hue vivaad ke sandarbh main dekhne kii koshish kar rahe hai ki jab koi ladki bolti he to uske saath kya kya hota he
 How does she fight herself before speaking, how does the world fight her when she speaks
 ham baat kar rahe hai ki hinsa kaa dar samaapt karne kii zimmedaari jitna abivipi kii he utani hi isa kii he, in donon se sabase adhik javabdehi police or uniwarsity kii he
 We have taken consent from these girls, they have also shown courage that they will speak on the situation of speaking
 duniya main virodh kaa tarika sarkaar nahin tay karegi
 People will decide
 ab dekhiye pradhanmantri ne man kii baat shuru kii
 In response, Congress leader Sandeep Dixit started talking about work
 ve bhi radio ke zariye kaam kii baat main pradhanmantri se sawaal karte hai or internet par daal dete hai
 This is how democracy thrives
 tarah tarah kii awaazen sunai detii hai
 Between these voices, you choose someone as Prime Minister and you do not choose anyone
 miranda house kii aditi kahati hai, 'main kisi sanghathan kii nahin hum
 If someone did not like something, they should have a peaceful demonstration
 unke paas soshal media par bahut se log likhane se darate hai
 They are running away from politics
 yah raajnneeti ke liye acha nahin he
 Why do they think that the gang of abusers will start writing anonymously
 aap gaali dene waalon kii profile check kiijie
 See which political party they are supporters of
 whatsap aajkal soochna ke naam par kachra failaayaa ja rahaa he
 There are rumors of anonymity
 puraa tantra laga hua he kisi ko bheetar bheetar badnaam karne main
 Probably for all these reasons especially ordinary women are afraid to write
 gurmeher ke post par bhi kisi kisi baaten likhi gai hai
 The police has registered a case
 dekhte hai kya hota he
 On Tuesday, a march took place at Delhi University
 is march kaa aayojan chaatr or shikshakon ne kiya tha
 The AISA organization was also involved
 is march main sarvapriya sangwan ne un ladakiyon se baat kii jo kisi sanghathan kii to nahin hai magar hinsa kii raajnneeti ke virodh main ain thim
 Hopefully the college administration will not disturb such speaking girls but will issue a letter to them that you have brightened the name of the college by participating in a peaceful demonstration
 aisa patr college ke principal ko dena chahie
 It should be given to the members of ABVP and also to the people of AISA
 or un chaatro ko bhi jo kisi sanghathan se nahin hai jaise aditi
 Nidikshma Sharma is a student of Ramjas
 wo kahati hai, 'hamane dekha ki kaise hamaari uniwarsity rit place main badal gai
 This thing is meant to be kept
 virodh karnaa zaruri he kyonki wo hamen daraana chaahate hai
 ' soshal media par ham kaisaa samaaj banane de rahe hai jahaan ladakiyon ko bolte vakt sochna pade ki khatara to nahin he
 If you come out of the house then there is danger, stay at home and speak to the world even then there is danger jab jubaan hi nahin bachegi to betiyaan kiske liye bachengi
 Will the statistics department and women's welfare department survive for data
 bahut si ladkiyaan hai jo in gaali dene vaale girohon kaa muqabla kar rahi hai
 His contribution will be remembered in times to come
 gaali dene vaale ek baat yaad rakhen
 Governments and political parties will quit using them
 ve soshal media main chaahe jo likh len, jis bhi netaa kaa naam le len magar samaaj main kabhi nahin bataa sakenge ki ve kisi raajnneetik dal ke samarthan main gaaliyaan likhte hai
 Threaten people
 ek chaatra pranjal ne kaha, 'pehle main is protest main aana nahin chaahati thi kyonki mere parent bahut chintit the
 It is not that they support ABVP, but they are afraid of ABVP not to do anything to me
 pranjal kii tarah hi sarvapriya ko dilli vishvavidhyalay ke march main skool kii ek chaatra mili
 Aditi wo pranjal ke saath hi thi
 Aditi said that fear has become her weapon and it is more important for girls to protest because they are told that you are weak
 tippaniyan Various types of protests are taking place in the world
 bharat main hi haazi ali dargah or shani mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh ko lekar kitna jabardast andolan hua
 Women started this movement
 apane sawaal ke naam par vot lene ke liye nahin balki samaaj ko badalane ke liye
 You remember Nikita Azad
 patiala kii nikita ne akele napkin andolan kii shuruyaat kar di
 Nikita wrote a letter to the trustee of the Sabarimala temple that i am a twenty year old girl, my eyes, ears, nose, lips, hands, feet are all like other human beings
 main ek aurat hum jise maahvaaree hoti he
 i have heard mother say that one should not go to temples at such times
 aurat apavitra hoti he
 This letter from Nikita created uproar in the country in which she asked the Sabarimala people why women are being prevented from coming to the temple during menstruation
 yah sawaal usne akele uthaaya
 Congress did not lift from bjp's platform
 in dalon ke netaaon kii saansen phool jaaengi
 So it is important that someone should raise their voice alone
 jab koi aisa kare to ham saath den
 Also ask a voice person
 nikita se bhi sawaal hue magar use sawaal karne ke liye daraana thik nahin he
 Girls are raising their voices
 inhen akele main yaa bheed main kisi bhi kaaran se maarane waalon ko dhamkaane waalon kaa saath mat dijie
 It may be that the crowd has the right arguments, reasons, but it is not the court
 wo kanoon nahin he
 He does not have the right to decide on the road for the right thing
 yah baat chemistry ke silebus kaa nahin he
 Is in the syllabus of common life
 bina skool gaye samaj main aa sakati he
 Hi Gurmehar Kaur, i am Fayaz Khan from Pakistan
 jab main pehali baar australia aayaa to sabhi bharatiyon ko vaise dekhtaa tha jaise mujhe skool main sikhaaya gaya tha
 But soon we started eating in the class room, sharing chairs as if we were close friends
 kargil yuddh main tumhaare pita kii maut par ham sabhi ko afsos he
 i have seen war, have seen deaths in my hometown of Swat but have not lost any member of my house by luck, but i have thousands of Gurmehar Kaur around me
 main bharat aana chahta hum bina kisi viza kii pabandi kii
 We will fight together against these restrictions
 seemaa ke donon taraf hazaron logon ko gurmeher cor kii tarah takalifon se guzaranaa na pade, ham iske liye ladenge
 i cannot give you the love of your father, but of course you have got a brother from the enemy country
 chalo is duniya main ek anokhaa rishta banaate hai jahaan bhai ek musalmaan he or bahan ek sikh
 Now this enemy country replaces the word with Sibling country
 matlab bhai bahan kaa desh kar dete hai
 This effect was from Gurmehar's video
 gurmeher cor ke video ke khilaaf bhi kai video aa rahe hai
 He is also being criticized
 hamaara focus is baat par he jab koi akeli ladki bolti he to kya hota he
 Go to Twitter and submit the abuses given to Gurmehar Kaur
 nari devi he ke naam par nautanki karne vaale samaaj kii pole khul jaaegi
 What is the point, Gurmehar Kaur posted the video that she is not afraid of ABVP
 magar use kinare karne ke liye ek saal purana video nikaala gaya or is tarah pesh kiya gaya jaise wo pakistan ke khilaaf ladate hue maare gaye sainikon kii qurbaani ko chota kar rahi he
 Is using her father
 dhundne waalon ko usee you-tub par yahi video mila hoga lekin unhone aap tak yah baat nahin failaai kyonki koshish he ki aap rashtrawaad ke naam par sankate rahen
 Keep giving the feeling of violence inside you a chance
 gurmeher ke post ne jo hasil kiya wo hazaar mixilon se bhi duniya main ajtak kahin bhi hasil nahin ho sakaa he
 Sibling Country
 bhai bahan kaa desh
 We did not use the word martyr
 ham nahin karte hai
 You ask why we do not use martyrs, who answer
 or ye jawaab grih rajya mantri kiren rijiju ne loksabhaa main diya he
 In reply to the question of Lalganj MP Neelam Sonkar on 22 December 2015, the Minister of State for Home Affairs said that "the Ministry of Defense has informed that the word 'martyr' is not used in the context of any casualties in the Indian Armed Forces
" isi prakaar kisi kaary yaa kaarywahi ke dauraan kendriya sashastr police balon or assam rifles ke javaanon kii mrityu ho jane ke sandarbh main bhi aisa shabd prayukt nahin hota he
 The same answer was given by former Minister of State for Home RPN Singh in Lok Sabha on 18 February 2014 that the government has never defined the term martyr
 abivipi ko kiren rijiju se poochna chahie ki desh ke liye jaan dene vaale sainikon ke liye shahid shabd kaa istemaal kyon nahin hota he
 The government and the military do not call those who sacrificed their lives a martyr
 yah jawaab aapako loksabhaa kii website se mil jaayenge
 You can take a print out and tweet them
 bharat sarkaar seemaa par jaan dene vaale sainikon ke liye shahid shabd kaa istemaal nahin karti he
 Be cautious about newspapers and TV or else you will be among those who grumble the fleet of this country
 inamen se zyaadaatar kaa kaam hukumat ke liye zindaabad bolnaa ho gaya he
 Gurmehar Kaur has spoken as much as she spoke
 uske virodh main log bole to samarthan main bhi bole hai
 She is a student isse badi baat kya ho sakati he ki pratham varsh kii is chaatra kaa saath uske shikshakon ne diya he

 It is quite satisfying for us teachers that they have expressed themselves with great sensitivity, creativity and bravery rather than resorting to silence on the environment around them

 magar use kinare karne ke liye ek saal purana video nikaala gaya or is tarah pesh kiya gaya jaise wo pakistan ke khilaaf ladate hue maare gaye sainikon kii qurbaani ko chota kar rahi he
 Is using her father
 dhundne waalon ko usee you-tub par yahi video mila hoga lekin unhone aap tak yah baat nahin failaai kyonki koshish he ki aap rashtrawaad ke naam par sankate rahen
 Keep giving the feeling of violence inside you a chance
 gurmeher ke post ne jo hasil kiya wo hazaar mixilon se bhi duniya main ajtak kahin bhi hasil nahin ho sakaa he
 Sibling Country
 bhai bahan kaa desh
 We did not use the word martyr
 ham nahin karte hai
 You ask why we do not use martyrs, who answer
 or ye jawaab grih rajya mantri kiren rijiju ne loksabhaa main diya he
 In reply to the question of Lalganj MP Neelam Sonkar on 22 December 2015, the Minister of State for Home Affairs said that "the Ministry of Defense has informed that the word 'martyr' is not used in the context of any casualties in the Indian Armed Forces
" isi prakaar kisi kaary yaa kaarywahi ke dauraan kendriya sashastr police balon or assam rifles ke javaanon kii mrityu ho jane ke sandarbh main bhi aisa shabd prayukt nahin hota he
 The same answer was given by former Minister of State for Home RPN Singh in Lok Sabha on 18 February 2014 that the government has never defined the term martyr
 abivipi ko kiren rijiju se poochna chahie ki desh ke liye jaan dene vaale sainikon ke liye shahid shabd kaa istemaal kyon nahin hota he
 The government and the military do not call those who sacrificed their lives a martyr
 yah jawaab aapako loksabhaa kii website se mil jaayenge
 You can take a print out and tweet them
 bharat sarkaar seemaa par jaan dene vaale sainikon ke liye shahid shabd kaa istemaal nahin karti he
 Be cautious about newspapers and TV or else you will be among those who grumble the fleet of this country
 inamen se zyaadaatar kaa kaam hukumat ke liye zindaabad bolnaa ho gaya he
 Gurmehar Kaur has spoken as much as she spoke
 uske virodh main log bole to samarthan main bhi bole hai
 She is a student isse badi baat kya ho sakati he ki pratham varsh kii is chaatra kaa saath uske shikshakon ne diya he
 Teachers in the English Department of Lady Shri Ram College have issued a statement which states, 'we are a faculty member of the English Department of Lady Shri Ram College, clearly and strongly supporting our student Gurmehar Kaur
 uniwarsity se jude muddon par apane vichaaron ko rakhane ke uske adhikaar kaa samarthan karte hai
 It is quite satisfying for us teachers that they have expressed themselves with great sensitivity, creativity and bravery rather than resorting to silence on the environment around them
 hamen lagata he ki shiksha sansthaanon kaa ye kartavya he ki wo apane chaatro ko hinsaatmak badale kii karrwai ke dar se dur unhen samvedansheel or javabdeh banaaen or unamem aalochanatmak chintan kii kshamta viksit karen
 We are proud that Gurmehar has performed his duty as a young citizen of this country
 use mil rahi hinsa or barbarta kii dhamkiyon kii ham ninda karte hai
 Social media responses by public figures such as Virender Sehwag and Randeep Hooda are shameful forms of intimidation and fear that Gurmehar is facing, towards the violent mob that the university has recently witnessed
 ham janata se samajhadaari kii apil karte hai
 We also appeal to those institutions that have the responsibility to restore people's trust in law and justice and provide an environment for our young citizens to think fearlessly and express themselves
 
 
 ' Governments have a lot of power
 ham or aap jab is ghatana ko bhul jaayenge to wo koi tarika nikaalegi
 The teachers supporting Gurmehar Kaur will harass her
 notice bhejegi
 They will get their register checked
 bahut se shikshak na to apane liye bol pate hai na apane chaatr ke liye
 Many teachers marry in this country with dowry and roam on the day of the teacher as deities

 aisi story ke liye taiyaar rahiye ki samarthan karne vaale teacheron ko kaise pareshaan kiya gaya
 What should a teacher do to not support her student, especially when the minister and MP are speaking against her
 twitor par use balaatkaar karne kii dhamkiyaan di ja rahi hon or likhakar gaaliyaan di ja rahi hon
 Suppose your daughter studies there, what should the teacher do
 is lihaaz se ye badi baat he
 The ABVP organized a tricolor trip on its behalf on Monday
 bijepi netaa shina ensi ne kaha he ki jise bhi pareshaani he use lekar bahes honi chahie
 There should be no place for violence
 abivipi ke netaa saket bahuguna ne morris nagar thane main shikaayat darj karai he
 It has been said that through the media from all over the country and also in TV studios, it has been said that some people are threatening to kill and rape them on social media
 desh ke kisi bhi naagarik ko aisi dhamkiyaan milanaa galat he
 The police should take strong action against such elements
 durbhaagya se gurmeher ji hamaare sanghathan abivipi par aarope laga rahi hai lekin main saaf karnaa chahta hum ki hamaara koi bhi daayitvadharee isamen shaamil nahin he
 As of late, Saket Bahuguna has done a good job
 saket ko kiren rijiju se bhi kahana chahie ki aap gurmeher kaa saath dijie, suraksha kiijie kyonki wo akeli he
 Even though he has opposed us
 phir bhi jitna uske bas main he utana to saket ne kiya hi
 Saket should now look at the pictures in which the people of his organization are shown committing violence
 wo chahen to hinsa karne vaale sadasyon ko nikaal sakate hai
 Even though the violence of the other factions remains in their organization, Saket Bahuguna has a great chance to respond to the opponents and send a message to his organization that we will not commit violence
 ummid he saket bahuguna kii yah baat mantriyon or saansadon tak pahonchegi jo gurmeher ke dimaag ko dooshit karne waalon kaa pataa laga rahe the
 Based on his one year old video, he was challenging his patriotism
 kisi bhi sarkaar kaa numaayinda ladakiyon kii baat ko bhale naapsand kare magar uski samaj yaa swatantra soch ko chunauti nahin de saktaa he
 However, now Gurmehar has made a statement separating himself from further proceedings, 'main campan se khud ko alag kar rahi hum
 Congratulations to all of you
 mujhe akelaa chhod den
 i said what i had to say
 ek cheez jo nishchit he ki ab ham hinsa karne yaa kisi ko dhamkee dene se pehle do baar sochenge, or isliye meraa virodh tha
 This campaign is for students, not for me
 march main badi sankhya main hissaa len jo koi bhi mere saahas or bahaduree par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 i will say to them that i have shown more courage than i have
 ' Gurmehar Kaur has done her work
 unke saath or unke pehle bhi bahut si ladakiyon ne awaz uthaai he
 We asked some young girls how the society around them treats them when they speak, for the first time or they speak again and again
 ve pehle kis dar se khud ko azaad karti hai or jab azaad hoti hai to unka bolnaa kis tarah se or kis kis ko daraa detaa he
 Who are the girls who say that they speak a lot, if you speak, then see, the purpose of today's prime time is to bring the girls who speak in response, so that you can see them
 zarur ladki hone ke kaaran use koi phayda nahin milanaa chahie, uski baat kaa tarkon ke aadhaar virodh hona chahie
 There should be debate, but when someone silences a girl, it should not be right for her to speak, to support her for her courage
 miranda house kii chaatra hani ne ek video hamen bheja he jisamen wo kah rahi hai, 'sabko awaz uthaani chahie, main nahin ham nahin to koun awaz uthayega
 'there is so much instruction for girls, yet someone comes forward to speak
 inaki parivaar waalon se guzarish he ki itnaa bhi na daren
 Siddhi says that whenever girls accompanying her are to speak, they are reminded of safety and kept silent
 wo koun log hai jo ladki ke bolne par khatara ban jate hai
 Resist his point
 asahmat hoiye lekin use yah bolne vaale koun log hote hai jo kehete hai ki thik nahin hoga
 Is such a voice coming from people sitting in a chair
 kahin aap aise logon kaa samarthan to nahin karte jo ladakiyon ke bolne par dekh lene kii baat karte hai
 There is no dearth of such people from society to all governments
 yamini dikshit aisi hi ek chaatra hai jo bolne ke apane anubhav ko aapse saajha karnaa chaahati hai
 Yamini is fighting for a place in the university where any kind of differences can be resolved through dialogue
 ramajas college main jhagade kaise hue, pathar kisne phenke, police kya kar rahi thi, isaki jaanch ho rahi he or kabhi nateeja nahin aayega
 So in prime time our motive is not to go into the reasons or side opposition to that quarrel
 ham gurmeher ko lekar hue vivaad ke sandarbh main dekhne kii koshish kar rahe hai ki jab koi ladki bolti he to uske saath kya kya hota he
 How does she fight herself before speaking, how does the world fight her when she speaks
 ham baat kar rahe hai ki hinsa kaa dar samaapt karne kii zimmedaari jitna abivipi kii he utani hi isa kii he, in donon se sabase adhik javabdehi police or uniwarsity kii he
 We have taken consent from these girls, they have also shown courage that they will speak on the situation of speaking
 duniya main virodh kaa tarika sarkaar nahin tay karegi
 People will decide
 ab dekhiye pradhanmantri ne man kii baat shuru kii
 In response, Congress leader Sandeep Dixit started talking about work
 ve bhi radio ke zariye kaam kii baat main pradhanmantri se sawaal karte hai or internet par daal dete hai
 This is how democracy thrives
 tarah tarah kii awaazen sunai detii hai
 Between these voices, you choose someone as Prime Minister and you do not choose anyone
 miranda house kii aditi kahati hai, 'main kisi sanghathan kii nahin hum
 If someone did not like something, they should have a peaceful demonstration
 unke paas soshal media par bahut se log likhane se darate hai
 They are running away from politics
 yah raajnneeti ke liye acha nahin he
 Why do they think that the gang of abusers will start writing anonymously
 aap gaali dene waalon kii profile check kiijie
 See which political party they are supporters of
 whatsap aajkal soochna ke naam par kachra failaayaa ja rahaa he
 There are rumors of anonymity
 puraa tantra laga hua he kisi ko bheetar bheetar badnaam karne main
 Probably for all these reasons especially ordinary women are afraid to write
 gurmeher ke post par bhi kisi kisi baaten likhi gai hai
 The police has registered a case
 dekhte hai kya hota he
 On Tuesday, a march took place at Delhi University
 is march kaa aayojan chaatr or shikshakon ne kiya tha
 The AISA organization was also involved
 is march main sarvapriya sangwan ne un ladakiyon se baat kii jo kisi sanghathan kii to nahin hai magar hinsa kii raajnneeti ke virodh main ain thim
 Hopefully the college administration will not disturb such speaking girls but will issue a letter to them that you have brightened the name of the college by participating in a peaceful demonstration
 aisa patr college ke principal ko dena chahie
 It should be given to the members of ABVP and also to the people of AISA
 or un chaatro ko bhi jo kisi sanghathan se nahin hai jaise aditi
 Nidikshma Sharma is a student of Ramjas
 wo kahati hai, 'hamane dekha ki kaise hamaari uniwarsity rit place main badal gai
 This thing is meant to be kept
 virodh karnaa zaruri he kyonki wo hamen daraana chaahate hai
 ' soshal media par ham kaisaa samaaj banane de rahe hai jahaan ladakiyon ko bolte vakt sochna pade ki khatara to nahin he
 If you come out of the house then there is danger, stay at home and speak to the world even then there is danger jab jubaan hi nahin bachegi to betiyaan kiske liye bachengi
 Will the statistics department and women's welfare department survive for data
 bahut si ladkiyaan hai jo in gaali dene vaale girohon kaa muqabla kar rahi hai
 His contribution will be remembered in times to come
 gaali dene vaale ek baat yaad rakhen
 Governments and political parties will quit using them
 ve soshal media main chaahe jo likh len, jis bhi netaa kaa naam le len magar samaaj main kabhi nahin bataa sakenge ki ve kisi raajnneetik dal ke samarthan main gaaliyaan likhte hai
 Threaten people
 ek chaatra pranjal ne kaha, 'pehle main is protest main aana nahin chaahati thi kyonki mere parent bahut chintit the
 It is not that they support ABVP, but they are afraid of ABVP not to do anything to me
 pranjal kii tarah hi sarvapriya ko dilli vishvavidhyalay ke march main skool kii ek chaatra mili
 Aditi wo pranjal ke saath hi thi
 Aditi said that fear has become her weapon and it is more important for girls to protest because they are told that you are weak
 tippaniyan Various types of protests are taking place in the world
 bharat main hi haazi ali dargah or shani mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh ko lekar kitna jabardast andolan hua
 Women started this movement
 apane sawaal ke naam par vot lene ke liye nahin balki samaaj ko badalane ke liye
 You remember Nikita Azad
 patiala kii nikita ne akele napkin andolan kii shuruyaat kar di
 Nikita wrote a letter to the trustee of the Sabarimala temple that i am a twenty year old girl, my eyes, ears, nose, lips, hands, feet are all like other human beings
 main ek aurat hum jise maahvaaree hoti he
 i have heard mother say that one should not go to temples at such times
 aurat apavitra hoti he
 This letter from Nikita created uproar in the country in which she asked the Sabarimala people why women are being prevented from coming to the temple during menstruation
 yah sawaal usne akele uthaaya
 Congress did not lift from bjp's platform
 in dalon ke netaaon kii saansen phool jaaengi
 So it is important that someone should raise their voice alone
 jab koi aisa kare to ham saath den
 Also ask a voice person
 nikita se bhi sawaal hue magar use sawaal karne ke liye daraana thik nahin he
 Girls are raising their voices
 inhen akele main yaa bheed main kisi bhi kaaran se maarane waalon ko dhamkaane waalon kaa saath mat dijie
 It may be that the crowd has the right arguments, reasons, but it is not the court
 wo kanoon nahin he
 He does not have the right to decide on the road for the right thing
 yah baat chemistry ke silebus kaa nahin he
 Is in the syllabus of common life

 We are proud that Gurmehar has performed his duty as a young citizen of this country
 use mil rahi hinsa or barbarta kii dhamkiyon kii ham ninda karte hai
 Social media responses by public figures such as Virender Sehwag and Randeep Hooda are shameful forms of intimidation and fear that Gurmehar is facing, towards the violent mob that the university has recently witnessed
 ham janata se samajhadaari kii apil karte hai
 We also appeal to those institutions that have the responsibility to restore people's trust in law and justice and provide an environment for our young citizens to think fearlessly and express themselves
 
 
 ' Governments have a lot of power
 ham or aap jab is ghatana ko bhul jaayenge to wo koi tarika nikaalegi
 The teachers supporting Gurmehar Kaur will harass her
 notice bhejegi
 They will get their register checked
 bahut se shikshak na to apane liye bol pate hai na apane chaatr ke liye
 Many teachers marry in this country with dowry and roam on the day of the teacher as deities
 aise shikshakon ke liye main un shikshakon kaa naam pard rahaa hum jinhone gurmeher kaa saath diya he
 Janet Lalwampui, Nangoum Maheshakanta Singh, Maitreyi Mandal, Johnathan Vagchaz, Rachita Mittal, Shernaz Cama, Aarti Minocha, Rukhsana Shroff, Madhu Grover, Wafa Hamid, Rita Joshi, Maya Joshi, Tania Sachdev, Mitali Mishra, Arunima Ray, Dipti Kar Rajeev, Tania Sachdev
 aisi story ke liye taiyaar rahiye ki samarthan karne vaale teacheron ko kaise pareshaan kiya gaya
 What should a teacher do to not support her student, especially when the minister and MP are speaking against her
 twitor par use balaatkaar karne kii dhamkiyaan di ja rahi hon or likhakar gaaliyaan di ja rahi hon
 Suppose your daughter studies there, what should the teacher do
 is lihaaz se ye badi baat he
 The ABVP organized a tricolor trip on its behalf on Monday
 bijepi netaa shina ensi ne kaha he ki jise bhi pareshaani he use lekar bahes honi chahie
 There should be no place for violence
 abivipi ke netaa saket bahuguna ne morris nagar thane main shikaayat darj karai he
 It has been said that through the media from all over the country and also in TV studios, it has been said that some people are threatening to kill and rape them on social media
 desh ke kisi bhi naagarik ko aisi dhamkiyaan milanaa galat he
 The police should take strong action against such elements
 durbhaagya se gurmeher ji hamaare sanghathan abivipi par aarope laga rahi hai lekin main saaf karnaa chahta hum ki hamaara koi bhi daayitvadharee isamen shaamil nahin he
 As of late, Saket Bahuguna has done a good job
 saket ko kiren rijiju se bhi kahana chahie ki aap gurmeher kaa saath dijie, suraksha kiijie kyonki wo akeli he
 Even though he has opposed us
 phir bhi jitna uske bas main he utana to saket ne kiya hi
 Saket should now look at the pictures in which the people of his organization are shown committing violence
 wo chahen to hinsa karne vaale sadasyon ko nikaal sakate hai
 Even though the violence of the other factions remains in their organization, Saket Bahuguna has a great chance to respond to the opponents and send a message to his organization that we will not commit violence
 ummid he saket bahuguna kii yah baat mantriyon or saansadon tak pahonchegi jo gurmeher ke dimaag ko dooshit karne waalon kaa pataa laga rahe the
 Based on his one year old video, he was challenging his patriotism
 kisi bhi sarkaar kaa numaayinda ladakiyon kii baat ko bhale naapsand kare magar uski samaj yaa swatantra soch ko chunauti nahin de saktaa he
 However, now Gurmehar has made a statement separating himself from further proceedings, 'main campan se khud ko alag kar rahi hum
 Congratulations to all of you
 mujhe akelaa chhod den
 i said what i had to say
 ek cheez jo nishchit he ki ab ham hinsa karne yaa kisi ko dhamkee dene se pehle do baar sochenge, or isliye meraa virodh tha
 This campaign is for students, not for me
 march main badi sankhya main hissaa len jo koi bhi mere saahas or bahaduree par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 i will say to them that i have shown more courage than i have
 ' Gurmehar Kaur has done her work
 unke saath or unke pehle bhi bahut si ladakiyon ne awaz uthaai he
 We asked some young girls how the society around them treats them when they speak, for the first time or they speak again and again
 ve pehle kis dar se khud ko azaad karti hai or jab azaad hoti hai to unka bolnaa kis tarah se or kis kis ko daraa detaa he
 Who are the girls who say that they speak a lot, if you speak, then see, the purpose of today's prime time is to bring the girls who speak in response, so that you can see them
 zarur ladki hone ke kaaran use koi phayda nahin milanaa chahie, uski baat kaa tarkon ke aadhaar virodh hona chahie
 There should be debate, but when someone silences a girl, it should not be right for her to speak, to support her for her courage
 miranda house kii chaatra hani ne ek video hamen bheja he jisamen wo kah rahi hai, 'sabko awaz uthaani chahie, main nahin ham nahin to koun awaz uthayega
 'there is so much instruction for girls, yet someone comes forward to speak
 inaki parivaar waalon se guzarish he ki itnaa bhi na daren
 Siddhi says that whenever girls accompanying her are to speak, they are reminded of safety and kept silent
 wo koun log hai jo ladki ke bolne par khatara ban jate hai
 Resist his point
 asahmat hoiye lekin use yah bolne vaale koun log hote hai jo kehete hai ki thik nahin hoga
 Is such a voice coming from people sitting in a chair
 kahin aap aise logon kaa samarthan to nahin karte jo ladakiyon ke bolne par dekh lene kii baat karte hai
 There is no dearth of such people from society to all governments
 yamini dikshit aisi hi ek chaatra hai jo bolne ke apane anubhav ko aapse saajha karnaa chaahati hai
 Yamini is fighting for a place in the university where any kind of differences can be resolved through dialogue
 ramajas college main jhagade kaise hue, pathar kisne phenke, police kya kar rahi thi, isaki jaanch ho rahi he or kabhi nateeja nahin aayega
 So in prime time our motive is not to go into the reasons or side opposition to that quarrel
 ham gurmeher ko lekar hue vivaad ke sandarbh main dekhne kii koshish kar rahe hai ki jab koi ladki bolti he to uske saath kya kya hota he
 How does she fight herself before speaking, how does the world fight her when she speaks
 ham baat kar rahe hai ki hinsa kaa dar samaapt karne kii zimmedaari jitna abivipi kii he utani hi isa kii he, in donon se sabase adhik javabdehi police or uniwarsity kii he
 We have taken consent from these girls, they have also shown courage that they will speak on the situation of speaking
 duniya main virodh kaa tarika sarkaar nahin tay karegi
 People will decide
 ab dekhiye pradhanmantri ne man kii baat shuru kii
 In response, Congress leader Sandeep Dixit started talking about work
 ve bhi radio ke zariye kaam kii baat main pradhanmantri se sawaal karte hai or internet par daal dete hai
 This is how democracy thrives
 tarah tarah kii awaazen sunai detii hai
 Between these voices, you choose someone as Prime Minister and you do not choose anyone
 miranda house kii aditi kahati hai, 'main kisi sanghathan kii nahin hum
 If someone did not like something, they should have a peaceful demonstration
 unke paas soshal media par bahut se log likhane se darate hai
 They are running away from politics
 yah raajnneeti ke liye acha nahin he
 Why do they think that the gang of abusers will start writing anonymously
 aap gaali dene waalon kii profile check kiijie
 See which political party they are supporters of
 whatsap aajkal soochna ke naam par kachra failaayaa ja rahaa he
 There are rumors of anonymity
 puraa tantra laga hua he kisi ko bheetar bheetar badnaam karne main
 Probably for all these reasons especially ordinary women are afraid to write
 gurmeher ke post par bhi kisi kisi baaten likhi gai hai
 The police has registered a case
 dekhte hai kya hota he
 On Tuesday, a march took place at Delhi University
 is march kaa aayojan chaatr or shikshakon ne kiya tha
 The AISA organization was also involved
 is march main sarvapriya sangwan ne un ladakiyon se baat kii jo kisi sanghathan kii to nahin hai magar hinsa kii raajnneeti ke virodh main ain thim
 Hopefully the college administration will not disturb such speaking girls but will issue a letter to them that you have brightened the name of the college by participating in a peaceful demonstration
 aisa patr college ke principal ko dena chahie
 It should be given to the members of ABVP and also to the people of AISA
 or un chaatro ko bhi jo kisi sanghathan se nahin hai jaise aditi
 Nidikshma Sharma is a student of Ramjas
 wo kahati hai, 'hamane dekha ki kaise hamaari uniwarsity rit place main badal gai
 This thing is meant to be kept
 virodh karnaa zaruri he kyonki wo hamen daraana chaahate hai
 ' soshal media par ham kaisaa samaaj banane de rahe hai jahaan ladakiyon ko bolte vakt sochna pade ki khatara to nahin he
 If you come out of the house then there is danger, stay at home and speak to the world even then there is danger jab jubaan hi nahin bachegi to betiyaan kiske liye bachengi
 Will the statistics department and women's welfare department survive for data
 bahut si ladkiyaan hai jo in gaali dene vaale girohon kaa muqabla kar rahi hai
 His contribution will be remembered in times to come
 gaali dene vaale ek baat yaad rakhen
 Governments and political parties will quit using them
 ve soshal media main chaahe jo likh len, jis bhi netaa kaa naam le len magar samaaj main kabhi nahin bataa sakenge ki ve kisi raajnneetik dal ke samarthan main gaaliyaan likhte hai
 Threaten people
 ek chaatra pranjal ne kaha, 'pehle main is protest main aana nahin chaahati thi kyonki mere parent bahut chintit the
 It is not that they support ABVP, but they are afraid of ABVP not to do anything to me
 pranjal kii tarah hi sarvapriya ko dilli vishvavidhyalay ke march main skool kii ek chaatra mili
 Aditi wo pranjal ke saath hi thi
 Aditi said that fear has become her weapon and it is more important for girls to protest because they are told that you are weak
 tippaniyan Various types of protests are taking place in the world
 bharat main hi haazi ali dargah or shani mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh ko lekar kitna jabardast andolan hua
 Women started this movement
 apane sawaal ke naam par vot lene ke liye nahin balki samaaj ko badalane ke liye
 You remember Nikita Azad
 patiala kii nikita ne akele napkin andolan kii shuruyaat kar di
 Nikita wrote a letter to the trustee of the Sabarimala temple that i am a twenty year old girl, my eyes, ears, nose, lips, hands, feet are all like other human beings
 main ek aurat hum jise maahvaaree hoti he
 i have heard mother say that one should not go to temples at such times
 aurat apavitra hoti he
 This letter from Nikita created uproar in the country in which she asked the Sabarimala people why women are being prevented from coming to the temple during menstruation
 yah sawaal usne akele uthaaya
 Congress did not lift from bjp's platform
 in dalon ke netaaon kii saansen phool jaaengi
 So it is important that someone should raise their voice alone
 jab koi aisa kare to ham saath den
 Also ask a voice person
 nikita se bhi sawaal hue magar use sawaal karne ke liye daraana thik nahin he
 Girls are raising their voices
 inhen akele main yaa bheed main kisi bhi kaaran se maarane waalon ko dhamkaane waalon kaa saath mat dijie
 It may be that the crowd has the right arguments, reasons, but it is not the court
 wo kanoon nahin he
 He does not have the right to decide on the road for the right thing
 yah baat chemistry ke silebus kaa nahin he
 Is in the syllabus of common life
 bina skool gaye samaj main aa sakati he
 Governments have a lot of power
 ham or aap jab is ghatana ko bhul jaayenge to wo koi tarika nikaalegi

 Be prepared for a story of how the supporting teachers were harassed
 ek teacher ko apni chaatra kaa saath nahin dena chahie to kya karnaa chahie, khaskar tab jab uske kilaaf mantri or saansad bol rahe hon
 On Twitter, he is being threatened with rape and abuses in writing
 maan lijie ki aapaki beti vahaan padhati ho to teacher ko kya karnaa chahie
 In this sense, it is a big deal
 abivipi ne somvaar ko apni taraf se tirangaa yatra kaa aayojan kiya tha
 BJP leader Shaina NC has said that there should be a debate on whoever is in trouble
 hinsa kii koi jagah nahin honi chahie
 ABVP leader Saket Bahuguna has filed a complaint at the Morris Nagar police station
 kaha he ki media ke madhyam se puure desh se or mujhase bhi tivi studio main ye baat kahi he ki kuch log unhen soshal media par jaan se maarane or balaatkaar kii dhamkee de rahe hai
 It is wrong for any citizen of the country to receive such threats
 police ko aise tatwon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kerani chahie
 Unfortunately Gurmehar ji is blaming our organization ABVP but i want to make it clear that none of our liabilities are involved in this
 der se hi sahi, saket bahuguna ne acha kaam kiya he
 Saket should also tell Kiren Rijiju that you should support Gurmehar, protect because she is alone
 bhale hi usne hamaara virodh kiya he
 Still, Saket did as much as he has
 saket ko ab un tasveeron ko dekhnaa chahie jisamen uske sanghathan ke log hinsa karte dikhaaye gaye hai
 If they want, they can remove the members who commit violence
 bhale hi duusare gut ke hinsa karne vaale apane sanghathan main bane rahen magar saket bahuguna ke paas ek shandaar mauka he virodhiyon ko jawaab dene kaa or apane sanghathan ko sandesh dene kaa ki ham hinsa nahin karenge
 It is expected that this talk of Saket Bahuguna will reach the ministers and mps who were looking for those who corrupted Gurmehar's mind
 uske ek saal puraane video ke aadhaar par uski deshbhakti yaa samadh ko chunauti de rahe the
 The representative of any government may dislike the talk of the girls but cannot challenge their understanding or independent thinking
 baharhaal ab gurmeher ne khud ko aage kii kaarywahi se alag karte hue bayaan diya he ki, 'I am separating myself from the campaign
 aap sabhi ko badhai
 Leave me alone mujhe jo kahana tha wo maine kah diya
 One thing that is certain is that now we will think twice before committing violence or threatening someone, and so i was opposed
 ye campan chaatro ke liye he, mere liye nahin
 Participate in large numbers in March, whoever is questioning my courage and bravery
 unke liye kahuungi ki maine zarurat se zyaada himmat dikhaai he
 ' gurmeher cor ne apana kaam kar diya he
 Many girls have voiced with them and even before them
 hamane kuch noujvaan ladakiyon se poocha ki jab wo bolti hai, pehali baar bolti hai yaa baar baar bolti hai to unke aas paas kaa samaaj unke saath kis tarah kaa bartaav karata he
 With what fear does she first liberate herself, and when she is free, how can she speak and which scares someone
 koun hai jo ladakiyon ke bolne par kehete hai ki bahut bolti ho, bologi to dekh lenaa, aaj ke prime time kaa makasad iske jawaab main un ladakiyon ko samaane laana he jo bolti hai, taaki aap unhen dekh saken
 Surely she should not get any benefit due to being a girl, her talk should be opposed on the basis of arguments
 bahes honi chahie lekin jab koi kisi ladki ko chup karaaye to uski baat ke liye na sahi, uski himmat ke liye uskaa saath dena chahie
 Honey, a student of Miranda House, has sent us a video in which she is saying, 'everyone should raise their voice, not me or who will raise their voice
 ' ladakiyon ke liye kitni hidaayat hoti he phir bhi koi na koi aage aati he bolne ke liye
 His family is requested not to be afraid too much
 siddhi kahati hai ki jab bhi unke saath kii ladkiyaan bolne ko hoti hai unhen suraksha kii yaad dilaakar chup kara diya jaataa he
 Who are those people who become a threat when a girl speaks? uski baat kaa virodh kiijie
 Disagree but who are the people who say it, that they say will not be okay
 kya aisi awaz kursi par baithe logon se bhi aa rahi he
 Somewhere you do not support such people who talk about seeing girls when they speak
 samaaj se lekar tamaam sarkaron main aise logon kii kami nahin hai
 Yamini Dixit is one such student who wants to share her speaking experience with you
 yamini uniwarsity main ek aisi jagah ke liye lard rahi he jahaan kisi bhi tarah kaa matbhed baatcheet ke zariye suljhaayaa ja sake
 How the fights took place in Ramjas College, who threw stones, what the police were doing, it is being investigated and there will never be a result
 isliye prime time main hamaara makasad us jhagade ke kaarnon yaa paksh vipaksh main janaa nahin he
 We are trying to see in the context of the controversy over Gurmehar what happens to a girl when she speaks
 wo bolne se pehle khud se kaise ladati he, jab wo bolti he to usase duniya kaise ladati he
 We are talking that the responsibility of ending the fear of violence is as much as abvp's responsibility to AISA, the police and university have the most accountability for both of them
 hamane in ladakiyon se sahmati lee he, unhone bhi himmat dikhaai he ki ve bolne ke halaat par bolengi
 The government will not decide the way of protest in the world
 log tay karenge
 Now see, the Prime Minister started Mann Ki Baat
 iske jawaab main congress ke netaa sandip dikshit ne kaam kii baat shuru kar di
 They also question the Prime Minister about the work through radio and put it on the Internet
 is tarah se loktantr faltaa phulata he
 Different sounds are heard
 in awaazon ke bich hi aap kisi ko pradhanmantri chunate hai or kisi ko nahin chunate hai
 Aditi from Miranda House says, 'I don't belong to any organization
 agar kisi ko kuch pasand nahin tha to unhen shantipurna pradarshan karnaa chahie
 He has many people afraid to write on social media
 ve raajnneeti se bhaagane lage hai
 This is not good for politics
 unhen kyon lagata he ki gaali dene waalon kaa giroh anaap shanaap likhane lagegaa
 Check the profile of your abuser
 dekhiye ki ve kis raajnneetik dal ke samarthak hai
 whatsapp is being spread in the name of information nowadays
 anaap shanaap afvaahen hai
 The whole system is engaged in defaming someone inside
 shaayad inhen sab vajahon se khaskar aam mahilaayein likhane se ghabraati hai
 What kind of things have been written on Gurmehar's post too
 police ne maamla to darj kiya he
 Let's see what happens
 mangalvaar ko dilli vishvavidhyalay main ek march hua
 This march was organized by students and teachers
 isa sanghathan bhi shaamil tha
 In this March, Sarvapriya Sangwan spoke to girls who are not from any organization but came against the politics of violence
 ummid he ki college prashasan aisi bolne vaali ladakiyon ko pareshaan nahin karegaa balki unhen ek patr jari karegaa ki aapane shantipurna pradarshan main hissaa lekar college kaa naam raushan kiya he
 Such a letter should be given to the principal of the college
 abivipi ke sadasyon ko bhi dena chahie or isa waalon ko bhi
 And also those students who are not from any organization like Aditi
 nidikshma sharma ramajas kii chaatra hai
 She says, 'we saw how our university turned into Riot Place
 ye baat rakhane ke liye hoti he
 It is important to protest because they want to scare us
 ' What kind of society are we letting on social media where girls have to think while speaking that there is danger? ghar se niklo to khatara, ghar main rahakar duniya se bolo tab bhi khatara
 When the tongue is not left, the daughters will save for whom
 kya sankhyikee vibhaag or mahila kalyaan vibhaag ke aankadon ke liye bachengi
 There are many girls who are combating these abusive gangs
 aane vaale vakt main unka yogadan yaad kiya jayega
 Remember one thing that abuses
 sarkarein or raajnneetik dal unka istemaal kar chhod denge
 Whatever they write on social media, they can take the name of any leader but in society they will never be able to tell that they write abuses in support of any political party
 logon ko dhamkaate hai
 Pranjal, a student, said, 'at first i did not want to come to this Protest because my parents were very worried
 aisa nahin he ki wo abivipi ko saport karte hai, lekin wo abivipi se darate hai ki kahin wo mujhe kuch na kar den
 Like Pranjal, Sarvapriya got a school student in Delhi University in March
 aditi
 She was with Pranjal
 aditi ne kaha ki dar unka hathiyaar ho gaya he or ladakiyon ke liye virodh karnaa zyaada zaruri he kyonki unhen bolaa jaataa he ki tum kamazor ho
 The comments duniya main tarah tarah ke virodh pradarshan ho rahe hai
 What a tremendous movement in India for the entry of women into the Haji Ali Dargah and the Shani Temple
 mahilaon ne yah andolan chalaaya
 Not to take votes in the name of your question but to change the society
 aapako nikita azaad yaad he
 Nikita of Patiala started the napkin movement alone
 nikita ne sabarimala mandir ke trustee ko patr likh diya ki main bees saal kii ladki hum, mere aankh, kaan, naak, hont, haath, paanv sab hai jaise duusare insaanon ke hai
 i am a woman who has menstruation
 maine maa ko kehete suna he ki aise samay main mandiron main nahin janaa chahie
 a woman is impure
 nikita ke is patr ne desh main hangaamaa machaa diya jisamen usne sabarimala waalon se poocha tha ki maahvaaree ke samay auraton ko mandir aane se kyon roka ja rahaa he
 He raised this question alone
 congress bijepi ke manch se nahin uthaaya
 The breath of the leaders of these parties will swell
 isliye zaruri he ki koi akele bhi awaz uthaae
 When someone does this, then we support
 awaz uthaane vaale se sawaal bhi karen
 Nikita was also questioned but it is not right to scare her
 ladkiyaan awaz uthaa rahi hai
 Do not support those who kill them in private or in the crowd for any reason
 ho saktaa he ki bheed ke paas sabase sahi tark hon, kaaran hon magar wo adaalat nahin he
 That is not the law
 sahi baat ke liye sadak par faisla karne kaa adhikaar uske paas nahin he
 This is not the case with the syllabus of chemistry
 aam zindagi ke silebus main he
 Can understand without going to school
 abivipi ne somvaar ko apni taraf se tirangaa yatra kaa aayojan kiya tha
 BJP leader Shaina NC has said that there should be a debate on whoever is in trouble
 hinsa kii koi jagah nahin honi chahie
 ABVP leader Saket Bahuguna has filed a complaint at the Morris Nagar police station
 kaha he ki media ke madhyam se puure desh se or mujhase bhi tivi studio main ye baat kahi he ki kuch log unhen soshal media par jaan se maarane or balaatkaar kii dhamkee de rahe hai
 It is wrong for any citizen of the country to receive such threats
 police ko aise tatwon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kerani chahie
 Unfortunately Gurmehar ji is blaming our organization ABVP but i want to make it clear that none of our liabilities are involved in this
 der se hi sahi, saket bahuguna ne acha kaam kiya he
 Saket should also tell Kiren Rijiju that you should support Gurmehar, protect because she is alone
 bhale hi usne hamaara virodh kiya he
 Still, Saket did as much as he has
 saket ko ab un tasveeron ko dekhnaa chahie jisamen uske sanghathan ke log hinsa karte dikhaaye gaye hai
 If they want, they can remove the members who commit violence
 bhale hi duusare gut ke hinsa karne vaale apane sanghathan main bane rahen magar saket bahuguna ke paas ek shandaar mauka he virodhiyon ko jawaab dene kaa or apane sanghathan ko sandesh dene kaa ki ham hinsa nahin karenge
 It is expected that this talk of Saket Bahuguna will reach the ministers and mps who were looking for those who corrupted Gurmehar's mind
 uske ek saal puraane video ke aadhaar par uski deshbhakti yaa samadh ko chunauti de rahe the
 The representative of any government may dislike the talk of the girls but cannot challenge their understanding or independent thinking
 baharhaal ab gurmeher ne khud ko aage kii kaarywahi se alag karte hue bayaan diya he ki, 'I am separating myself from the campaign
 aap sabhi ko badhai
 Leave me alone mujhe jo kahana tha wo maine kah diya
 One thing that is certain is that now we will think twice before committing violence or threatening someone, and so i was opposed
 ye campan chaatro ke liye he, mere liye nahin
 Participate in large numbers in March, whoever is questioning my courage and bravery
 unke liye kahuungi ki maine zarurat se zyaada himmat dikhaai he
 ' gurmeher cor ne apana kaam kar diya he
 Many girls have voiced with them and even before them
 hamane kuch noujvaan ladakiyon se poocha ki jab wo bolti hai, pehali baar bolti hai yaa baar baar bolti hai to unke aas paas kaa samaaj unke saath kis tarah kaa bartaav karata he
 With what fear does she first liberate herself, and when she is free, how can she speak and which scares someone
 koun hai jo ladakiyon ke bolne par kehete hai ki bahut bolti ho, bologi to dekh lenaa, aaj ke prime time kaa makasad iske jawaab main un ladakiyon ko samaane laana he jo bolti hai, taaki aap unhen dekh saken
 Surely she should not get any benefit due to being a girl, her talk should be opposed on the basis of arguments
 bahes honi chahie lekin jab koi kisi ladki ko chup karaaye to uski baat ke liye na sahi, uski himmat ke liye uskaa saath dena chahie
 Honey, a student of Miranda House, has sent us a video in which she is saying, 'everyone should raise their voice, not me or who will raise their voice
 ' ladakiyon ke liye kitni hidaayat hoti he phir bhi koi na koi aage aati he bolne ke liye
 His family is requested not to be afraid too much
 siddhi kahati hai ki jab bhi unke saath kii ladkiyaan bolne ko hoti hai unhen suraksha kii yaad dilaakar chup kara diya jaataa he
 Who are those people who become a threat when a girl speaks? uski baat kaa virodh kiijie
 Disagree but who are the people who say it, that they say will not be okay
 kya aisi awaz kursi par baithe logon se bhi aa rahi he
 Somewhere you do not support such people who talk about seeing girls when they speak
 samaaj se lekar tamaam sarkaron main aise logon kii kami nahin hai
 Yamini Dixit is one such student who wants to share her speaking experience with you
 yamini uniwarsity main ek aisi jagah ke liye lard rahi he jahaan kisi bhi tarah kaa matbhed baatcheet ke zariye suljhaayaa ja sake
 How the fights took place in Ramjas College, who threw stones, what the police were doing, it is being investigated and there will never be a result
 isliye prime time main hamaara makasad us jhagade ke kaarnon yaa paksh vipaksh main janaa nahin he
 We are trying to see in the context of the controversy over Gurmehar what happens to a girl when she speaks
 wo bolne se pehle khud se kaise ladati he, jab wo bolti he to usase duniya kaise ladati he
 We are talking that the responsibility of ending the fear of violence is as much as abvp's responsibility to AISA, the police and university have the most accountability for both of them
 hamane in ladakiyon se sahmati lee he, unhone bhi himmat dikhaai he ki ve bolne ke halaat par bolengi
 The government will not decide the way of protest in the world
 log tay karenge
 Now see, the Prime Minister started Mann Ki Baat
 iske jawaab main congress ke netaa sandip dikshit ne kaam kii baat shuru kar di
 They also question the Prime Minister about the work through radio and put it on the Internet
 is tarah se loktantr faltaa phulata he
 Different sounds are heard
 in awaazon ke bich hi aap kisi ko pradhanmantri chunate hai or kisi ko nahin chunate hai
 Aditi from Miranda House says, 'I don't belong to any organization

 Can understand without going to school
 ummid he saket bahuguna kii yah baat mantriyon or saansadon tak pahonchegi jo gurmeher ke dimaag ko dooshit karne waalon kaa pataa laga rahe the
 Based on his one year old video, he was challenging his patriotism
 kisi bhi sarkaar kaa numaayinda ladakiyon kii baat ko bhale naapsand kare magar uski samaj yaa swatantra soch ko chunauti nahin de saktaa he
 However, now Gurmehar has made a statement separating himself from further proceedings, 'main campan se khud ko alag kar rahi hum
 Congratulations to all of you
 mujhe akelaa chhod den
 i said what i had to say
 ek cheez jo nishchit he ki ab ham hinsa karne yaa kisi ko dhamkee dene se pehle do baar sochenge, or isliye meraa virodh tha
 This campaign is for students, not for me
 march main badi sankhya main hissaa len jo koi bhi mere saahas or bahaduree par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 i will say to them that i have shown more courage than i have
 ' Gurmehar Kaur has done her work
 unke saath or unke pehle bhi bahut si ladakiyon ne awaz uthaai he
 We asked some young girls how the society around them treats them when they speak, for the first time or they speak again and again
 ve pehle kis dar se khud ko azaad karti hai or jab azaad hoti hai to unka bolnaa kis tarah se or kis kis ko daraa detaa he
 Who are the girls who say that they speak a lot, if you speak, then see, the purpose of today's prime time is to bring the girls who speak in response, so that you can see them
 zarur ladki hone ke kaaran use koi phayda nahin milanaa chahie, uski baat kaa tarkon ke aadhaar virodh hona chahie
 There should be debate, but when someone silences a girl, it should not be right for her to speak, to support her for her courage
 miranda house kii chaatra hani ne ek video hamen bheja he jisamen wo kah rahi hai, 'sabko awaz uthaani chahie, main nahin ham nahin to koun awaz uthayega
 'there is so much instruction for girls, yet someone comes forward to speak
 inaki parivaar waalon se guzarish he ki itnaa bhi na daren
 Siddhi says that whenever girls accompanying her are to speak, they are reminded of safety and kept silent
 wo koun log hai jo ladki ke bolne par khatara ban jate hai
 Resist his point
 asahmat hoiye lekin use yah bolne vaale koun log hote hai jo kehete hai ki thik nahin hoga
 Is such a voice coming from people sitting in a chair
 kahin aap aise logon kaa samarthan to nahin karte jo ladakiyon ke bolne par dekh lene kii baat karte hai
 There is no dearth of such people from society to all governments
 yamini dikshit aisi hi ek chaatra hai jo bolne ke apane anubhav ko aapse saajha karnaa chaahati hai
 Yamini is fighting for a place in the university where any kind of differences can be resolved through dialogue
 ramajas college main jhagade kaise hue, pathar kisne phenke, police kya kar rahi thi, isaki jaanch ho rahi he or kabhi nateeja nahin aayega
 So in prime time our motive is not to go into the reasons or side opposition to that quarrel
 ham gurmeher ko lekar hue vivaad ke sandarbh main dekhne kii koshish kar rahe hai ki jab koi ladki bolti he to uske saath kya kya hota he
 How does she fight herself before speaking, how does the world fight her when she speaks
 ham baat kar rahe hai ki hinsa kaa dar samaapt karne kii zimmedaari jitna abivipi kii he utani hi isa kii he, in donon se sabase adhik javabdehi police or uniwarsity kii he
 We have taken consent from these girls, they have also shown courage that they will speak on the situation of speaking
 duniya main virodh kaa tarika sarkaar nahin tay karegi
 People will decide
 ab dekhiye pradhanmantri ne man kii baat shuru kii
 In response, Congress leader Sandeep Dixit started talking about work
 ve bhi radio ke zariye kaam kii baat main pradhanmantri se sawaal karte hai or internet par daal dete hai
 This is how democracy thrives
 tarah tarah kii awaazen sunai detii hai
 Between these voices, you choose someone as Prime Minister and you do not choose anyone
 miranda house kii aditi kahati hai, 'main kisi sanghathan kii nahin hum
 If someone did not like something, they should have a peaceful demonstration
 unke paas soshal media par bahut se log likhane se darate hai
 They are running away from politics
 yah raajnneeti ke liye acha nahin he
 Why do they think that the gang of abusers will start writing anonymously
 aap gaali dene waalon kii profile check kiijie
 See which political party they are supporters of
 whatsap aajkal soochna ke naam par kachra failaayaa ja rahaa he
 There are rumors of anonymity
 puraa tantra laga hua he kisi ko bheetar bheetar badnaam karne main
 Probably for all these reasons especially ordinary women are afraid to write
 gurmeher ke post par bhi kisi kisi baaten likhi gai hai
 The police has registered a case
 dekhte hai kya hota he
 On Tuesday, a march took place at Delhi University
 is march kaa aayojan chaatr or shikshakon ne kiya tha
 The AISA organization was also involved
 is march main sarvapriya sangwan ne un ladakiyon se baat kii jo kisi sanghathan kii to nahin hai magar hinsa kii raajnneeti ke virodh main ain thim
 Hopefully the college administration will not disturb such speaking girls but will issue a letter to them that you have brightened the name of the college by participating in a peaceful demonstration
 aisa patr college ke principal ko dena chahie
 It should be given to the members of ABVP and also to the people of AISA
 or un chaatro ko bhi jo kisi sanghathan se nahin hai jaise aditi
 Nidikshma Sharma is a student of Ramjas
 wo kahati hai, 'hamane dekha ki kaise hamaari uniwarsity rit place main badal gai
 This thing is meant to be kept
 virodh karnaa zaruri he kyonki wo hamen daraana chaahate hai
 ' soshal media par ham kaisaa samaaj banane de rahe hai jahaan ladakiyon ko bolte vakt sochna pade ki khatara to nahin he
 If you come out of the house then there is danger, stay at home and speak to the world even then there is danger jab jubaan hi nahin bachegi to betiyaan kiske liye bachengi
 Will the statistics department and women's welfare department survive for data
 bahut si ladkiyaan hai jo in gaali dene vaale girohon kaa muqabla kar rahi hai
 His contribution will be remembered in times to come
 gaali dene vaale ek baat yaad rakhen
 Governments and political parties will quit using them
 ve soshal media main chaahe jo likh len, jis bhi netaa kaa naam le len magar samaaj main kabhi nahin bataa sakenge ki ve kisi raajnneetik dal ke samarthan main gaaliyaan likhte hai
 Threaten people
 ek chaatra pranjal ne kaha, 'pehle main is protest main aana nahin chaahati thi kyonki mere parent bahut chintit the
 It is not that they support ABVP, but they are afraid of ABVP not to do anything to me
 pranjal kii tarah hi sarvapriya ko dilli vishvavidhyalay ke march main skool kii ek chaatra mili
 Aditi wo pranjal ke saath hi thi
 Aditi said that fear has become her weapon and it is more important for girls to protest because they are told that you are weak
 tippaniyan Various types of protests are taking place in the world
 bharat main hi haazi ali dargah or shani mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh ko lekar kitna jabardast andolan hua
 Women started this movement
 apane sawaal ke naam par vot lene ke liye nahin balki samaaj ko badalane ke liye
 You remember Nikita Azad
 patiala kii nikita ne akele napkin andolan kii shuruyaat kar di
 Nikita wrote a letter to the trustee of the Sabarimala temple that i am a twenty year old girl, my eyes, ears, nose, lips, hands, feet are all like other human beings
 main ek aurat hum jise maahvaaree hoti he
 i have heard mother say that one should not go to temples at such times
 aurat apavitra hoti he
 This letter from Nikita created uproar in the country in which she asked the Sabarimala people why women are being prevented from coming to the temple during menstruation
 yah sawaal usne akele uthaaya
 Congress did not lift from bjp's platform
 in dalon ke netaaon kii saansen phool jaaengi
 So it is important that someone should raise their voice alone
 jab koi aisa kare to ham saath den
 Also ask a voice person
 nikita se bhi sawaal hue magar use sawaal karne ke liye daraana thik nahin he
 Girls are raising their voices
 inhen akele main yaa bheed main kisi bhi kaaran se maarane waalon ko dhamkaane waalon kaa saath mat dijie
 It may be that the crowd has the right arguments, reasons, but it is not the court
 wo kanoon nahin he
 He does not have the right to decide on the road for the right thing
 yah baat chemistry ke silebus kaa nahin he
 Is in the syllabus of common life
 bina skool gaye samaj main aa sakati he
 Gurmehar Kaur has done her work

 Aditi said that fear has become her weapon and it is more important for girls to protest because they are told that you are weak
 tippaniyan Various types of protests are taking place in the world
 bharat main hi haazi ali dargah or shani mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh ko lekar kitna jabardast andolan hua
 Women started this movement
 apane sawaal ke naam par vot lene ke liye nahin balki samaaj ko badalane ke liye
 You remember Nikita Azad
 patiala kii nikita ne akele napkin andolan kii shuruyaat kar di
 Nikita wrote a letter to the trustee of the Sabarimala temple that i am a twenty year old girl, my eyes, ears, nose, lips, hands, feet are all like other human beings
 main ek aurat hum jise maahvaaree hoti he
 i have heard my mother say that one should not go to temples at such times 
 aurat apavitra hoti he
 This letter from Nikita created uproar in the country in which she asked the Sabarimala people why women are being prevented from coming to the temple during menstruation
 yah sawaal usne akele uthaaya
 Congress did not lift from bjp's platform
 in dalon ke netaaon kii saansen phool jaaengi
 So it is important that someone should raise their voice alone
 jab koi aisa kare to ham saath den
 Also ask a voice person
 nikita se bhi sawaal hue magar use sawaal karne ke liye daraana thik nahin he
 Girls are raising their voices
 inhen akele main yaa bheed main kisi bhi kaaran se maarane waalon ko dhamkaane waalon kaa saath mat dijie
 It may be that the crowd has the right arguments, reasons, but it is not the court
 wo kanoon nahin he
 He does not have the right to decide on the road for the right thing
 yah baat chemistry ke silebus kaa nahin he
 Is in the syllabus of common life
 bina skool gaye samaj main aa sakati he
 Honey, a student of Miranda House, has sent us a video in which she is saying, 'everyone should raise their voice, not me or who will raise their voice
 ' ladakiyon ke liye kitni hidaayat hoti he phir bhi koi na koi aage aati he bolne ke liye
 His family is requested not to be afraid too much
 siddhi kahati hai ki jab bhi unke saath kii ladkiyaan bolne ko hoti hai unhen suraksha kii yaad dilaakar chup kara diya jaataa he
 Who are those people who become a threat when a girl speaks? uski baat kaa virodh kiijie
 Disagree but who are the people who say it, that they say will not be okay
 kya aisi awaz kursi par baithe logon se bhi aa rahi he
 Somewhere you do not support such people who talk about seeing girls when they speak
 samaaj se lekar tamaam sarkaron main aise logon kii kami nahin hai
 Yamini Dixit is one such student who wants to share her speaking experience with you
 yamini uniwarsity main ek aisi jagah ke liye lard rahi he jahaan kisi bhi tarah kaa matbhed baatcheet ke zariye suljhaayaa ja sake
 How the fights took place in Ramjas College, who threw stones, what the police were doing, it is being investigated and there will never be a result
 isliye prime time main hamaara makasad us jhagade ke kaarnon yaa paksh vipaksh main janaa nahin he
 We are trying to see in the context of the controversy over Gurmehar what happens to a girl when she speaks
 wo bolne se pehle khud se kaise ladati he, jab wo bolti he to usase duniya kaise ladati he
 We are talking that the responsibility of ending the fear of violence is as much as abvp's responsibility to AISA, the police and university have the most accountability for both of them
 hamane in ladakiyon se sahmati lee he, unhone bhi himmat dikhaai he ki ve bolne ke halaat par bolengi
 The government will not decide the way of protest in the world
 log tay karenge
 Now see, the Prime Minister started Mann Ki Baat
 iske jawaab main congress ke netaa sandip dikshit ne kaam kii baat shuru kar di
 They also question the Prime Minister about the work through radio and put it on the Internet
 is tarah se loktantr faltaa phulata he
 Different sounds are heard
 in awaazon ke bich hi aap kisi ko pradhanmantri chunate hai or kisi ko nahin chunate hai
 Aditi from Miranda House says, 'I don't belong to any organization
 agar kisi ko kuch pasand nahin tha to unhen shantipurna pradarshan karnaa chahie
 He has many people afraid to write on social media
 ve raajnneeti se bhaagane lage hai
 This is not good for politics
 unhen kyon lagata he ki gaali dene waalon kaa giroh anaap shanaap likhane lagegaa
 Check the profile of your abuser
 dekhiye ki ve kis raajnneetik dal ke samarthak hai
 whatsapp is being spread in the name of information nowadays
 anaap shanaap afvaahen hai
 The whole system is engaged in defaming someone inside
 shaayad inhen sab vajahon se khaskar aam mahilaayein likhane se ghabraati hai
 What kind of things have been written on Gurmehar's post too
 police ne maamla to darj kiya he
 Let's see what happens
 mangalvaar ko dilli vishvavidhyalay main ek march hua
 This march was organized by students and teachers
 isa sanghathan bhi shaamil tha
 In this March, Sarvapriya Sangwan spoke to girls who are not from any organization but came against the politics of violence
 ummid he ki college prashasan aisi bolne vaali ladakiyon ko pareshaan nahin karegaa balki unhen ek patr jari karegaa ki aapane shantipurna pradarshan main hissaa lekar college kaa naam raushan kiya he
 Such a letter should be given to the principal of the college
 abivipi ke sadasyon ko bhi dena chahie or isa waalon ko bhi
 And also those students who are not from any organization like Aditi
 nidikshma sharma ramajas kii chaatra hai
 She says, 'we saw how our university turned into Riot Place
 ye baat rakhane ke liye hoti he
 It is important to protest because they want to scare us
 ' What kind of society are we letting on social media where girls have to think while speaking that there is danger? ghar se niklo to khatara, ghar main rahakar duniya se bolo tab bhi khatara
 When the tongue is not left, the daughters will save for whom
 kya sankhyikee vibhaag or mahila kalyaan vibhaag ke aankadon ke liye bachengi
 There are many girls who are combating these abusive gangs
 aane vaale vakt main unka yogadan yaad kiya jayega
 Remember one thing that abuses
 sarkarein or raajnneetik dal unka istemaal kar chhod denge
 Whatever they write on social media, they can take the name of any leader but in society they will never be able to tell that they write abuses in support of any political party
 logon ko dhamkaate hai
 Pranjal, a student, said, 'at first i did not want to come to this Protest because my parents were very worried
 aisa nahin he ki wo abivipi ko saport karte hai, lekin wo abivipi se darate hai ki kahin wo mujhe kuch na kar den
 Like Pranjal, Sarvapriya got a school student in Delhi University in March
 aditi
 She was with Pranjal
 aditi ne kaha ki dar unka hathiyaar ho gaya he or ladakiyon ke liye virodh karnaa zyaada zaruri he kyonki unhen bolaa jaataa he ki tum kamazor ho
 The comments duniya main tarah tarah ke virodh pradarshan ho rahe hai
 What a tremendous movement in India for the entry of women into the Haji Ali Dargah and the Shani Temple
 mahilaon ne yah andolan chalaaya
 Not to take votes in the name of your question but to change the society
 aapako nikita azaad yaad he
 Nikita of Patiala started the napkin movement alone
 nikita ne sabarimala mandir ke trustee ko patr likh diya ki main bees saal kii ladki hum, mere aankh, kaan, naak, hont, haath, paanv sab hai jaise duusare insaanon ke hai
 i am a woman who has menstruation
 maine maa ko kehete suna he ki aise samay main mandiron main nahin janaa chahie
 a woman is impure
 nikita ke is patr ne desh main hangaamaa machaa diya jisamen usne sabarimala waalon se poocha tha ki maahvaaree ke samay auraton ko mandir aane se kyon roka ja rahaa he
 He raised this question alone
 congress bijepi ke manch se nahin uthaaya
 The breath of the leaders of these parties will swell
 isliye zaruri he ki koi akele bhi awaz uthaae
 When someone does this, then we support
 awaz uthaane vaale se sawaal bhi karen
 Nikita was also questioned but it is not right to scare her
 ladkiyaan awaz uthaa rahi hai
 Do not support those who kill them in private or in the crowd for any reason
 ho saktaa he ki bheed ke paas sabase sahi tark hon, kaaran hon magar wo adaalat nahin he
 That is not the law
 sahi baat ke liye sadak par faisla karne kaa adhikaar uske paas nahin he
 This is not the case with the syllabus of chemistry
 aam zindagi ke silebus main he
 Can understand without going to school
 yamini uniwarsity main ek aisi jagah ke liye lard rahi he jahaan kisi bhi tarah kaa matbhed baatcheet ke zariye suljhaayaa ja sake

 The comments duniya main tarah tarah ke virodh pradarshan ho rahe hai
 What a tremendous movement in India for the entry of women into the Haji Ali Dargah and the Shani Temple
 mahilaon ne yah andolan chalaaya
 Not to take votes in the name of your question but to change the society
 aapako nikita azaad yaad he
 Nikita of Patiala started the napkin movement alone
 nikita ne sabarimala mandir ke trustee ko patr likh diya ki main bees saal kii ladki hum, mere aankh, kaan, naak, hont, haath, paanv sab hai jaise duusare insaanon ke hai
 i am a woman who has menstruation
 maine maa ko kehete suna he ki aise samay main mandiron main nahin janaa chahie
 a woman is impure
 nikita ke is patr ne desh main hangaamaa machaa diya jisamen usne sabarimala waalon se poocha tha ki maahvaaree ke samay auraton ko mandir aane se kyon roka ja rahaa he
 He raised this question alone
 congress bijepi ke manch se nahin uthaaya
 The breath of the leaders of these parties will swell
 isliye zaruri he ki koi akele bhi awaz uthaae
 When someone does this, then we support
 awaz uthaane vaale se sawaal bhi karen
 Nikita was also questioned but it is not right to scare her
 ladkiyaan awaz uthaa rahi hai
 Do not support those who kill them in private or in the crowd for any reason
 ho saktaa he ki bheed ke paas sabase sahi tark hon, kaaran hon magar wo adaalat nahin he
 That is not the law
 sahi baat ke liye sadak par faisla karne kaa adhikaar uske paas nahin he
 This is not the case with the syllabus of chemistry
 aam zindagi ke silebus main he
 Can understand without going to school
 duniya main virodh kaa tarika sarkaar nahin tay karegi
 People will decide
 ab dekhiye pradhanmantri ne man kii baat shuru kii
 In response, Congress leader Sandeep Dixit started talking about work
 ve bhi radio ke zariye kaam kii baat main pradhanmantri se sawaal karte hai or internet par daal dete hai
 This is how democracy thrives
 tarah tarah kii awaazen sunai detii hai
 Between these voices, you choose someone as Prime Minister and you do not choose anyone
 miranda house kii aditi kahati hai, 'main kisi sanghathan kii nahin hum
 If someone did not like something, they should have a peaceful demonstration
 unke paas soshal media par bahut se log likhane se darate hai
 They are running away from politics
 yah raajnneeti ke liye acha nahin he
 Why do they think that the gang of abusers will start writing anonymously
 aap gaali dene waalon kii profile check kiijie
 See which political party they are supporters of
 whatsap aajkal soochna ke naam par kachra failaayaa ja rahaa he
 There are rumors of anonymity
 puraa tantra laga hua he kisi ko bheetar bheetar badnaam karne main
 Probably for all these reasons especially ordinary women are afraid to write
 gurmeher ke post par bhi kisi kisi baaten likhi gai hai
 The police has registered a case
 dekhte hai kya hota he
 On Tuesday, a march took place at Delhi University
 is march kaa aayojan chaatr or shikshakon ne kiya tha
 The AISA organization was also involved
 is march main sarvapriya sangwan ne un ladakiyon se baat kii jo kisi sanghathan kii to nahin hai magar hinsa kii raajnneeti ke virodh main ain thim
 Hopefully the college administration will not disturb such speaking girls but will issue a letter to them that you have brightened the name of the college by participating in a peaceful demonstration
 aisa patr college ke principal ko dena chahie
 It should be given to the members of ABVP and also to the people of AISA
 or un chaatro ko bhi jo kisi sanghathan se nahin hai jaise aditi
 Nidikshma Sharma is a student of Ramjas
 wo kahati hai, 'hamane dekha ki kaise hamaari uniwarsity rit place main badal gai
 This thing is meant to be kept
 virodh karnaa zaruri he kyonki wo hamen daraana chaahate hai
 ' soshal media par ham kaisaa samaaj banane de rahe hai jahaan ladakiyon ko bolte vakt sochna pade ki khatara to nahin he
 If you come out of the house then there is danger, stay at home and speak to the world even then there is danger jab jubaan hi nahin bachegi to betiyaan kiske liye bachengi
 Will the statistics department and women's welfare department survive for data
 bahut si ladkiyaan hai jo in gaali dene vaale girohon kaa muqabla kar rahi hai
 His contribution will be remembered in times to come
 gaali dene vaale ek baat yaad rakhen
 Governments and political parties will quit using them
 ve soshal media main chaahe jo likh len, jis bhi netaa kaa naam le len magar samaaj main kabhi nahin bataa sakenge ki ve kisi raajnneetik dal ke samarthan main gaaliyaan likhte hai

 apane sawaal ke naam par vot lene ke liye nahin balki samaaj ko badalane ke liye
 You remember Nikita Azad
 patiala kii nikita ne akele napkin andolan kii shuruyaat kar di
 Nikita wrote a letter to the trustee of the Sabarimala temple that i am a twenty year old girl, my eyes, ears, nose, lips, hands, feet are all like other human beings
 main ek aurat hum jise maahvaaree hoti he
 i have heard mother say that one should not go to temples at such times
 aurat apavitra hoti he
 This letter from Nikita created uproar in the country in which she asked the Sabarimala people why women are being prevented from coming to the temple during menstruation
 yah sawaal usne akele uthaaya
 Congress did not lift from bjp's platform
 in dalon ke netaaon kii saansen phool jaaengi
 So it is important that someone should raise their voice alone
 jab koi aisa kare to ham saath den
 Also ask a voice person
 nikita se bhi sawaal hue magar use sawaal karne ke liye daraana thik nahin he
 Girls are raising their voices
 inhen akele main yaa bheed main kisi bhi kaaran se maarane waalon ko dhamkaane waalon kaa saath mat dijie
 It may be that the crowd has the right arguments, reasons, but it is not the court
 wo kanoon nahin he
 He does not have the right to decide on the road for the right thing
 yah baat chemistry ke silebus kaa nahin he
 Is in the syllabus of common life
 bina skool gaye samaj main aa sakati he
 Pranjal, a student, said, 'at first i did not want to come to this Protest because my parents were very worried
 aisa nahin he ki wo abivipi ko saport karte hai, lekin wo abivipi se darate hai ki kahin wo mujhe kuch na kar den
 Like Pranjal, Sarvapriya got a school student in Delhi University in March
 aditi
 She was with Pranjal
 aditi ne kaha ki dar unka hathiyaar ho gaya he or ladakiyon ke liye virodh karnaa zyaada zaruri he kyonki unhen bolaa jaataa he ki tum kamazor ho
 The comments duniya main tarah tarah ke virodh pradarshan ho rahe hai
 What a tremendous movement in India for the entry of women into the Haji Ali Dargah and the Shani Temple
 mahilaon ne yah andolan chalaaya
 Not to take votes in the name of your question but to change the society
 aapako nikita azaad yaad he
 Nikita of Patiala started the napkin movement alone
 nikita ne sabarimala mandir ke trustee ko patr likh diya ki main bees saal kii ladki hum, mere aankh, kaan, naak, hont, haath, paanv sab hai jaise duusare insaanon ke hai
 i am a woman who has menstruation
 maine maa ko kehete suna he ki aise samay main mandiron main nahin janaa chahie
 a woman is impure
 nikita ke is patr ne desh main hangaamaa machaa diya jisamen usne sabarimala waalon se poocha tha ki maahvaaree ke samay auraton ko mandir aane se kyon roka ja rahaa he
 He raised this question alone
 congress bijepi ke manch se nahin uthaaya
 The breath of the leaders of these parties will swell
 isliye zaruri he ki koi akele bhi awaz uthaae
 When someone does this, then we support
 awaz uthaane vaale se sawaal bhi karen
 Nikita was also questioned but it is not right to scare her
 ladkiyaan awaz uthaa rahi hai
 Do not support those who kill them in private or in the crowd for any reason
 ho saktaa he ki bheed ke paas sabase sahi tark hon, kaaran hon magar wo adaalat nahin he
 That is not the law
 sahi baat ke liye sadak par faisla karne kaa adhikaar uske paas nahin he
 This is not the case with the syllabus of chemistry
 aam zindagi ke silebus main he
 Can understand without going to school
 duniya main tarah tarah ke virodh pradarshan ho rahe hai

 samaaj main naak oonchi hone kii kahavatein to aapane jarur suni hongi
 It must also be believed that it is often the nose of men
 lekin vigyaan ne bhi ab is tathy ko maan liya he ki purushon kii naak mahilaon kii naak se badi hoti he
 Researchers at the University of Iowa in the US have revealed this in their latest study on the human nose
 lekin sachai yah bhi he ki shodhakartaaon ne iskaa sambandh maan-sammaan se jodakar ekadam nahin bataaya he
 This research found that women's noses are 10 percent smaller on average than men's noses
 haalanki yah shodh vishesh taur par europea nagarikon ke liye kiya gaya he, or iske parinaam europea nagarikon par hi lagu hote hai
 According to researchers, men have more thin muscles in their body, due to which more oxygen is needed for the development of muscle tissue
 isiilie purushon kii naak badi hoti he, kyonki badi naak kaa matlab he shwasan ke jariye adhik se adhik oxigen kaa rakt ke jariye mansapeshiyon tak pahunchnaa
 Research also reveals the fact that this difference in the nose of men and women starts to become apparent at the age of 11 years
 amuman yah avasthaa tarunavastha main pravesh karne kii hoti he
 In physically healthy men, thin muscles develop rapidly during this period, whereas in women, thick muscles develop
 isse pehle hue shodh bataate hai ki purush apane sharir kaa 95 pratishat vajan tarunai ke dauraan hi praapt karte hai, jabaki mahilaayein is dauraan apane vajan kaa 85 pratishat hissaa viksit karti hai
 According to Nathan Houlton, the lead author of the research published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, a journal of science researches, and assistant spokesperson at UI Dental College, 'the relationship between body and nose shape has already been discussed in the literature
 lekin yah apane aap main pehla shodh he, jisamen mahilaon va purushon main unke sharir ke aakaar ke saath unki naak ke aakaar ke bich sambandh kii padtaal kii gai he
 For this research, Houlton and his team included 38 students aged between three and 20 years of European descent studying in the Facial Growth Study at the University of Iowa
 shodh main shaamil kiye gaye prayek vyakti ke aantarik or bahya angon kaa lagaataar maapan kiya jaataa rahaa
 Researchers found that boys and girls had a nose shape before the age of 11
 lekin tarunai ke saath-saath unke naak ke aakaar main antar aata gaya
 Halton said in his research, "even if the body size of a man and a woman are the same, the nose of a man is larger than a woman's nose
" 'unhone yah bhi kaha ki is shodh ke parinaam europea nagarikon ke saath hi duusare samudaayon par bhi lagu ho sakate hai, lekin abhi yah kahana thodi jaldbaaji hogi jab tak ki shodh ke jariye is tarah ke tathy praapt na kar liye jaaen

 In Ayodhya case, the people of Janakpur are busy preparing to celebrate in a curious manner, the Supreme Court has reserved its verdict regarding the birthplace of Ayodhya Ramlala but the people of the in-laws of Bhagwan Ram and the parents of Sita Mata in Janakpur, Nepal are away from Ayodhya
 We are eagerly waiting for this decision of the Supreme Court
 nepal ke log raja janak kii putree sita ji ko kishori ji ke naam se pukaarte hai, ve chaahate hai ki janakapur dham kii tarah yodhya main bhi bhavy ram mandir kaa nirmaan ho
 Mahanta Ram Roshan Das of Janakpur temple says that Lord Rama is our Pahun and son-in-law here
 janakapur unka sasuraal he, jab tak unhen uchit sthaan nahin milegaa, ham kaise khush rah sakate hai
 He said that for hundreds of years people have wanted that following the ideals of Lord Rama, a man walks on his life path, the same Ram is still living in a tent
 ham janakapur vaasi isse bahut dukhi hai rajmahal main palane vaali sita ji kaa ayodhya main koi jagah nahi hai
 In such a situation, the Supreme Court is expected that the decision will come in favor of building the temple
 janakapur wo jagah he jahaan sita mata kaa bachapan beetaa
 This is where Swayambar took place and Siya got Ram
 bihar seemaa se mushkil se 20 kilometre or mata sita ke prakaatya sthal sitamarhi se 60 kilometre dur janakapur ke logon main kaaphi utsukata he
 The gathering of devotees in the temple of Sita Mata, from the common man to the leader of the political party, with the decision of the Supreme Court, everyone wants a grand construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya
 jab se supreme court main yodhya main maamle ko lekar sunwaayee chal rahi he us din se janak dulaari sita mata ke mandir main bhakton kii bheed bad gai he or sabake man main ek hi aasthaa he ki supreme court kaa faisla mandir banane ke haq main aayega
 Radha Koirala, who came from Kathmandu to visit, says that a Ram temple should be built and we want to visit Ayodhya Lord Rama in the same way that we come to Janakpur to see Sita Mata
 isse bharat-nepal ke bich sambandh or majboot honge
 Nepal is socially and culturally connected to India and people have more faith in each other than Lord Ram's in-law Janakpur Nepal
 janakapur ke rajeev jha kehete hai ki aaj bhi jab koi yodhya se yahaan aata he to uskaa aaj bhi damaad kii tarah aadar-satkar kiya jaataa he
 There is a tradition of hospitality in Mithilanchal anyway
 vivaah panchami kii bhavy ho rahi taiyaarijanakpur dham ke mandir ke mahanth ram raushandas ke mutabik agar vivaah panchami ke pehle supreme court kaa faisla mandir banane ke paksh main aata he to is baar bhavy vivaah panchami samaaroh kaa aayojan kiya jayega
 Though Vivaha Panchami is celebrated every year, but after every 5 years it is celebrated in a grand manner and coincidentally, this year on December 21, Vivah is the fifth year of Panchami
 aise main janakapur vaasiyon ko puri ummid he ki faisla unke paksh main aayega
 Mahant Ram Roshan Das says that if the decision comes in favor, then many big people of India will come here with Lord Ram's procession and obviously the ceremony will be very grand
 is aayojan ke liye janakapur ko kesaria rang main ranga ja rahaa he
 The entire city is being painted in saffron color because Lord Rama loves saffron color
 yahi vajah he ki bhagwaan hanuman bhi apane badan par kesaria rang lagaate the
 Lalkishore Sah, Mayor of Janakpur Deputy Municipal Corporation, says that for the entire city to be painted in saffron color, the municipality is providing free saffron color to the general public so that as soon as Janakpur Dham comes, people should paint it in the color of faith and make it of Saffron City Know by name also

 Input: IANS dilli main aam aadmi party or congress ke bich tamaam koshishon ke baad bhi gathbandhan nahin ho paaya he
 Now both the parties are contesting all the seven Lok Sabha seats of Delhi on their own
 donon partiyon main aarope-pratyarope bhi chal rahe hai
 Now Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party national convenor Arvind Kejriwal has told why he has not been able to form an alliance with Congress
 tivi today network ke kansalting editor rajdeep saradesai ke saath khaas baatcheet main arvind kejariwal ne daawa kiya he ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii niyat nahin thi, isliye gathbandhan nahin ho paaya he
 Kejriwal said that the Aam Aadmi Party has tried its best for the alliance, but the Congress pulled back
 arvind kejariwal ne gathbandhan ko lekar congress se chali puri baatcheet bhi saamne rakhi
 Kejriwal said, 'the biggest issue facing the country is how to save the country from the pair of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah
 isiilie congress ke saath gathbandhan kaa nirnay liya tha'
 Kejriwal said that earlier there was talk of alliance on 33 seats in Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Goa, but later it reached 18 seats in Delhi, Haryana and Chandigarh
 kejariwal ne daawa kiya ki 18 siton par gathbandhan kii baat bilkul tay ho gai thi, agle din saajha press conference hone vaali thi
 But the next day the Congress leaders stopped picking up the phone
 arvind kejariwal ne bataaya ki 18 siton par baat tay hone ke baad congress ne haryana kii ek or seat par shart rakhi
 Kejriwal said that the Aam Aadmi Party also accepted the condition of the Congress, which was impossible, but still the Congress retreated
 twitor nahin, baatcheet se hota he gathbandhanagathabandhan ke liye congress ko jimmedaar bataate hue arvind kejariwal ne rahul gandhi kii niyat par bhi sawaal uthaae
 Kejriwal said that Rahul Gandhi tweeted about the alliance
 kejariwal ne kaha ki duniya ke itihaas main koun sa gathbandhan twitor par hua he
 This means that Rahul Gandhi was showing that he wanted to combine, but did not want to
 unhone kaha ki gathbandhan baithkar baatcheet se hote hai, is tarah twitor par nahin hote hai
 After all the efforts of the congress-aap alliance to get the bjp's alliance with the Congress, when this alliance could not be done, Kejriwal is now claiming that even if there was an alliance, the Congress would not have won its seats
 arvind kejariwal ne bataaya ki jo teen siten congress ko ham de rahe the, vahaan congress ko haar kaa saamana padataa
 In this sense, this alliance would not have belonged to the congress-aap but to the BJP-AAP
 aap ke paas the do vikalservind kejariwal ne bataaya ki aam aadmi party ke paas do vikalp the
 The first option was to form an alliance on the formula of 4-3 and gift the three seats given to the Congress directly to the BJP
 doosraa vikalp ye tha ki aam aadmi party saaton siton par mehnat kar sabhi siten bijepi se chin len
 Kejriwal said that AAP has chosen the second option and will win all seven seats in Delhi
 aam aadmi party ab isi duusare vikalp ke saath chunaav lard rahi he or uske saamne bijepi va congress he
 Now it has to be seen that when Delhi votes on May 12, the people of Delhi trust whom in this triangular contest

 There is chaos in the underworld
 mumbai ko garam kiya ja rahaa he
 Stories are being told gang-wise
 yah sab kuch ho rahaa he ek 'bhai' par hue hamale ke chalate
 
 
 Underworld don Abu Salem, who was jailed in Navi Mumbai jail, was shot inside the jail
 salem ko do goli maari gai, par goli uski ungali main lagi or vah batch gaya
 However, after this shootout, Chhota Shakeel has claimed on behalf of d-company that he has carried out the murderous attack on Salem
 lekin police is pahalu se bhi maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he ki sazaa se bachane ke liye kahin yah hamalaa khud abu salem ne hi to apane upar nahin karaayaa?mumbai main guuruuvaar kii raat jab anderworld ke target par ek cheharaa aayaa, to anderworld ke galiyaaron main ek baar phir bechaini bad gai
 This face was not of Dawood, not of Dawood's brother Iqbal, not even of Chhota Rajan, an enemy of Dawood, but of Abu Salem, a known enemy of both Dawood and Chhota Rajan
 lihaaja is target par nishaanaa sadhate hi anderworld main ek baar khalabali much gai he
 The target may have been only Abu Salem, but the entire underworld at stake
 aakhir kya he is hamale ke peeche kii hakeekat? kyon he abu salem kii jaan khatre main? koun he jo karnaa chahta he mumbai ko phir se garam? kya hamale ke peeche he di-company? chota rajan lenaa chahta he abu salem se badla yaa khud salem ne rachi he apane hi upar hamale kii saazish?bharat nepali gang kaa shooter devendra jagataap urf jedy isi jail main band tha
 He is accused of murdering a lawyer
 mangalvaar ko isi katl ke cese ke silsile main jedy peshi par court gaya hua tha
 Her wife and three companions came to meet JD in court
 jedy ke vakil ko chhodkar bas yahi chaar log usase court main aakhri baar mili the
 After production, JD returned to his General Barrack of Taloja Jail at around quarter to eight
 jail main entry kii kavayad puri karne jama talaashi ke baad jedy sava aath baje apane barrack main pahunchataa he
 Abu Salem was closed along with its barracks
 us vakt salem barrack main baitha hua tha
 There was a cardboard and some old newspapers lying in the barracks between Salem and Daisy
 thik usee vakt jedy ne achaanak revolver nikaal liya
 He fired two shots aimed at Abu Salem
 pehali goli nishaanaa chook gai, tab tak salem alert ho chukaa tha
 So when the second bullet opened, he bowed down
 is baar goli uske daahine haath kii ungali main lagi thi
 Meanwhile, JD tried to fire the third bullet, but the bullet got stuck in the revolver itself and could not fire
 tab tak do goliyon kii aawaaj sunakar jail ke guard or santari barrack main pahunch chuke the
 He caught the Jedi at the same time
 iske baad abu salem ko fouran pehle enememasi aspataal le jaaya gaya, phir raat kareeb do baje mubani ke jeje aspataal main shift kiya gaya, jahaan oparation ke baad uski ungali main fansi goli nikaal lee gai
 Salem survived the shootout inside the jail, but now the question arises that how did the revolver and the bullet arrive in a very safe prison? According to the police, every prisoner coming from outside in Taloja jail of Navi Mumbai is searched twice
 ek main get par or duusari barrack main daakhil hone se pehle
 But how did the Jedi dodge the security guards in both searches? Is there any complicity of jail staff in this? However, after initial investigation, four jail staff have been suspended
 2005 main portugal ne is shart par abu salem ko bharat ko saunpa tha ki wo uske gunahon ke liye use maut kii sazaa nahin degaa
 After this condition Salem was brought to Mumbai and lodged in Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai
 lekin 2010 main arthie road jail ke andar abu salem par 1993 ke mumbai serial blast ke gunahagaar mustafa dosa ne hamalaa kar diya
 Salem was badly injured in this
 isi ke baad salem ko 2010 main hi arthur road jail se navi mumbai ke taloja jail main shift kar diya gaya tha
 Here Salem was initially kept in the safest egg cell
 lekin phir baad main general barrack main shift kar diya gaya
 According to the Mumbai Police, on Tuesday, JD had gone for a court session, when he and his wife met three more people
 police ko shaq he ki jedy ko revolver inhen chaar logon me se kisi ne diya
 Obviously, dodging two places inside the jail means that either the security guard did not perform his duty properly or it could also be part of the conspiracy, which is why four people have been suspended at the moment
 jedy ko santosh shetty or vijay shetty ke gang kaa bataaya jaataa he
 According to sources, there was a fight between Salem and JD over ransom money a few weeks ago
 tabhi jedy ne salem ko dhamkee di thi
 According to sources, when both worked for Chhota Rajan, there was a dispute between the two about the money
 baad main salem ne apana gang bana liya or jedy santosh shetty or bharat shetty se jud gaya
 Shortly after the attack on Abu Salem, it was claimed by the d-company that the company had attacked Salem
 sutron ke mutabik shuruyaat main khud jedy ne bhi police ko yahi bataaya tha
 But then later the Jedi kept changing his statements constantly
 haalanki mumbai police sutron ke mutabik yah bhi mumkin he ki salem par yah hamalaa khud salem ne hi karaayaa ho, kyonki is hamale se salem ko ek bada phayda ho saktaa he
 According to the sources, Salem Taloja wanted to get out of jail and he has also given an application from the jail administration to shift him to a jail in Uttar Pradesh
 is arzi main usne jail adhikariyon ko taloja jail main jaan ke khatre kii baat bhi kahi thi
 According to sources, therefore, he had asked Bharat Nepali shooter Devendra Jagtap, who was lodged in the same jail, to attack him
 darasal salem is tarah se ek tir se do shikaar karnaa chahta he
 First, after this attack, he should be taken out of Maharashtra and sent to Uttar Pradesh
 agar aisa nahin hota he, to vah portugal kii sarkaar se use waapas portugal bhejne kii apil kar saktaa he
 In fact, when Salem was arrested and sent to India in Portugal, the Supreme Court of Portugal placed a condition before India that it could not sentence Salem to death
 agar use laga ki bharat kii jail main abu salem kii jaan ko khatra he, to vah bharat ke saath pratyrpan sandhi khatm kar salem ko waapas portugal bhejne kii maang kar saktaa he
 So the police suspect that Salem may have conspired to attack himself
 lihaaza is pahalu se bhi maamle kii jaanch kii ja rahi he

 is hafte ek se badhkar ek filmon jaise 'saat uchakke', 'ingirno', 'anna', 'lav de' ke bich bollywood kii baby doll sani leone kii film 'beyimaan lav' bhi relies hui
 The trailer and the songs were disappointing, but being a film lover and critic, i also reached the theater to watch 'unscrupulous Love', let me tell you the story of 'before' and 'after' like Ad
 
 
 film dekhne se pehle:theatre tak jane se pehle mere jahan main tha ki is film main bhi 2-3 special dance number (jinhen item song bhi kuch log kehete hai) honge
 There will be some intimate scenes and Sunny Leone will be seen acting a bit better
 intervalatak kahani kaa suspence barkaraar rahegaa or uske baad shaayad behatar clymex mili or antat ek acchhee film dekhne ko mil jaae
 During the film: As soon as the film starts, a special dance number starts to flick, in which Sunny Leone is seen performing in her style
 uske baad achaanak kuch bijness related seens, kuch pyaar kii chaah vaale seens, to kuch tipical bed sikvence saamne najar aate hai, or main sochataa rahata hum ki kahani kab shuru hogi
 Meanwhile, 'intermission' appears on the screen
 maine baahar nikaalkar yahi soch rahaa tha ki kahani shaayad second half main milegi
 Well after the interval once again forceful scenes, dialogues, some worn out intimate scenes and finally the film ends
 film dekhne ke baad:lagbhag do ghante kii film dekhne ke baad jab main theatre se baahar aayaa to mere jahan main ek hi sawaal chal rahaa tha ki aakhirkaar aisi filmein kiske liye banaai jaati hai? film main aisa kuch bhi nahin tha jo ki nayaa yaa alag rahaa ho
 Neither any amazing intimate scenes, nor tremendous songs, nor a good story
 aakhir kis jaldibaji main yah film banaayi gayi he
 Why would viewers come to see it? Some people can go to the theater in the name of Sunny Leone, but they too will be disappointed
 isse kahin behatar sani kii 'lila' or 'raagini ms 2' filmein thi
 The rest of the film's characters like Rajneesh Duggal, Rajiv Verma too could not leave a big impact
 aakhirkaarfilm kaa aagaajor anjaam ek sa tha or mujhe laga film main lav beyimaan nahin balki mere tikat ke paison ke saath beyimaani hui he
 So this was my story, the rest you can decide for yourself whether you want to see this film or not, because 'will is yours, after all money is yours

 ' spanish train talgo ko sintabar ke pehle pakhwaade main dilli or mumbai ke bich ek baar phir se chalaakar trial kiya jayega
 This will be Talgo's fifth and final trial on the Delhi and Mumbai routes
 agast main is train ke chaar trial ho chuke hai, lekin baari barish ke chalate trial puraa nahin ho sakaa
 Now the Ministry of Railways will take help of the Meteorological Department
 From August 1 to August 12, there were four trials of Talgo between Delhi and Mumbai, but during all these trials, there was a lot of rain on the way and once the track was flowing ahead of Surat, the train during the trial Did not even reach Mumbai
 aise main talgo train ko sitambar ke pehle pakhwaade main kisi aise din chalaakar dekha jayega, jab is train root par barish naa ho rahi ho
 Ministry of Railways will also take help of Meteorological Department in this matter
 11 ghante se kam samay main dilli-mumbai kii duuri tay karne kii ummidadrasal dilli or mumbai ke bich talgo ko 120 se 140 kilometre prati ghante kii adhiktam raftaar par chalaakar dekha gaya he
 The Talgo train has not been seen running between mumbai-delhi at a speed of 150 kmph
 talgo kaa daawa he ki unke kochej kii takanic aisi he ki maujuuda trek par hi unki gaadi 200 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar par daud sakati he, lekin is raftaar par chalaane ke liye rail patari kii fensing jaruri he
 No CRS clearance will be required for a speed of 150 kilometers per hour
 aise main is baat kii ummid he ki spanish train dilli or mumbai ke bich sintabar main hone ja rahe trial ke dauraan 150 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar par daudegi or in donon mahanagaron kii duuri 11 ghante se bhi kam samay main puraa kar legi
 According to a high official of the Talgorel Ministry, which has been successful in the time trial between Mumbai and Delhi, the train of Talgo has been successful in the time trial between Mumbai and Delhi
 talgo company ke dibbon kii khaasiyat ye he ki ye tej ghumaavdaar modon par bhi tej raftaar se chal sakate hai
 There are 795 windings on the trains between Delhi and Mumbai, where there is a speed limit for the speed of the train
 masalan 1
 The Indian Railways' Rajdhani Express has to run at a speed of 115 km per hour on 8-degree winding tracks, but Talgo trains can run at a speed of 142 km per hour
 isi tarah is root par bisiyon aise pul hai, jinpar rajdhani express ko 15 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar par chalaanaa padataa he
 But due to the Talco's coachees being light, there is no speed limit for them on these bridges
 aise main talgo ko lekar railway kaaphi aashwast najar aa rahi he
 This train of Talgo train compartment is made of aluminum, with 9 coaches, which has a coach generator, a dining car, plus 5 normal AC chair cars and 2 AC executive class coaches
 har saamaanya coach main 36 or ekjicutive class coach main 20 yatriyon ke baithne kii seat he
 Talgo coaches are less than half of the wheels of Indian Railways
 masalan ek rail dibbe main aath chakke lagaae jate hai, lekin talgo ke prati dibbe main do chakke lage hote hai
 Apart from this, the Talgo cans are only 16 tonnes as compared to the weight of 68 tonnes of Indian train coaches due to the aluminum, but they will cost more than three times the cost of Indian coaches
