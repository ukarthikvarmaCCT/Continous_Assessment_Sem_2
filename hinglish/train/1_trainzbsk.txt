 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye sabhi raajnneetik dal apane-apane ummidavaar tay karne main jute gaye hai or khabar he ki uttar pradesh ke lakhanu se saansad or kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh is baar gautam buddha nagar (noida) sansadeey seat se chunaav lard sakate hai
 In such a situation, the sitting MP and Union Minister Mahesh Sharma can be made the party candidate from Alwar in Rajasthan
 agar rajnath is baar noida se chunaav ladate hai to vah lagaataar teesri loksabhaa kaa chunaav apni teesri nai seat se ladenge
 He has contested from Ghaziabad in 2009 and Lucknow in 2014

 Sources associated with the BJP say that the initial survey conducted locally by the party leadership and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has anger against the party in the rural population of Gautam Buddha Nagar, which constitutes 40 of the total population of this parliamentary constituency
 Percent
 sansadeey kshetra main noida or greater noida jaise shahar ke alaava gramin ilaakon ke vidhansabha kshetra khurja, sinkaderabad or jevar aate hai

2 million voters come from rural areas while the remaining 7 lakh are urban voters
 inamen muslim, gujjar or jaaton ke baad rajputon kii sankhya sabase adhik he

 kshetra main 5 main se party ke 3 vidhayak rajnath singh ke bete pankaj singh, bimala solanki or dhirendra singh rajput hai
 The social equation of this parliamentary constituency is seen in favor of Rajnath Singh

 jabaki basapa ke satish kumaar tisare sthaan par rahe the
 But in the internal survey of the party, the BJP is now thinking of contesting the election from Alwar seat due to alleged resentment towards Mahesh Sharma in the rural areas here
 unka janm alvar ke manethi gaanv main hua tha
 On behalf of BJP, Mahant Chand Nath defeated Bhanwar Jitendra Singh from Alwar Lok Sabha seat by a margin of 2,83,895 votes in the 2014 Lok Sabha election

 Books like Akbar and Isaac Newton have a lot to say about Maharana Pratap and Aryabhatta
 unhone ek intervyuu ke dauraan ye tak kah daalaa ki akbar mahaan nahin, balki ek bahari shaasha tha
 He said that British and Muslim rulers came and ruled in our country

 bhimrao ambedkar pratimaa ko arajak tatwon ne tod diya
 On Tuesday morning, the people of Jatav community erupted after seeing the statue of Ambedkar broken
 soochna milte hi police kii team maukey par pahunchi
 He explained the situation to the people
 jaankaree ke mutabik, samvidhan nirmaataa dow
 The Bhimrao Ambedkar statue was broken by chaotic elements
 iske baad ghatnasthal par saikadon kii sankhya main pahunche jatav samaaj ke logon ne sarkaar virdohi naare lagaae
 The police demanded immediate arrest of the busters
 sthiti tanaavpurn hone par esadm or kshetradhikari ghatnasthal par pahunche

 Let it be said that earlier in Azamgarh, the statue of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the creator of the Constitution, was targeted

 The villagers were enraged when they saw the idol broken in the morning
 iske baad ghatana sthal par baari sankhya main gramin jamaa ho gaye
 The villagers had alleged that the statue has been broken several times, but no action has been taken till date

 Advocate Rajiv Dhawan of the Muslim side said that Muslims used to offer Namaz there, it is being questioned
 sthal par 22-23 disambar kii raat ko jis tarah se murti ko rakhaa gaya, vah hindu niyam ke anusaar sahi nahin he
 Dhawan said that the testimony of 40 witnesses was not cross-examined
 gopal singh vishaarad kii yachika main bhi bhagwaan ram ke janmasthan ke bare main nahin bataaya gaya
 It was claimed to be the birthplace under the dome in the middle of the mosque and demanded the right to worship
 dhawan ne kaha ki justise sudhir agarwal ne mana tha ki ram chabutare par puja kii jaati thi
 Dhawan opposed the observation of a judge of the High Court who said that Muslims had not been able to prove their occupation there
 dhawan ne kaha ki ham iskaa virodh karte hai, hamaara vahaan par kabza tha
 He referred to Sheetal Dubey's report which said that there was a havan and puja in the premises of the mosque and no namaz
 is par dhawan ne kaha ki vah havan or puja bhi ho sakati he
 This report did not say that Puja and Havan took place in the inner courtyard of the mosque
 dhawan ayodhya vivaad se judi kai puraani yachikaaon kaa zikr karte hue sabit karne kii koshish kar rahe the ki masjid par muslim paksh kaa kabza tha
 Dhawan said that Mutavalli had filed an application which the government had ordered
 gar masjid par muslimon kaa kabza nahin hota to vah mutavalli arzi kyon lagaataa or sarkaar faisla kyon detii
 This proves that the mosque was occupied by Muslims
 unhone kaha ki mohammad ajgar ne kabristaan par kabze ke liye arzi lagaai thi
 Rajiv Dhawan read the statement of a witness from the Hindu side, saying that the idol of Lord Rama was not in the sanctum sanctorum
 garbh grih ke andar koi bhi bhagwaan kii tasviir nahin thi, lekin tab bhi jo log puja karne aate ve railing kii taraf jaakar garbhagrih kii taraf jate the
 Rajiv Dhawan said that worship was never done inside the sanctum sanctorum
 galat tareeke se rakhi gai murti se daawey kaa adhikaar nahin ho saktaa
 Rajiv Dhawan completed the debate on behalf of the Muslim side in the Ayodhya case
 muslim paksh kii taraf se jafarayab jilani ne supreme court main daleel di ki janmasthal par ram janm kaa vishwaas to he, par saboot nahin
 He said that Ramcharit Manas and Valmiki Ramayana, it is for the petitioners to prove that which other books are mentioned in them! There is no mention of Ram's birthplace in Manas and Ramayana in any specific way
 san 1949 se pehle madhya gumbad ke neeche ram janm, puja kaa koi astitv yaa saboot nahin miltaa
 Justice Bobde asked that you also give evidence that before 1949 there was regular namaz? Jilani said that there is no oral evidence of this
 justise ashok bhushan ne kaha ki hindu paksh bhi, ramayana or maanas main ayodhya main dasharath mahal main ram janm kaa zikr he lekin sthaan kaa nahin
 Justice Chandrachud said that both texts refer to the birth of Ram in Ayodhya
 iskaa matlab kya yah he ki ayodhya main kahin bhi ram janmabhumi kaa daawa kar den?jilani ne kaha ki ram chabutara mandir se purana nahin he
 He quoted Ramanandacharya and Rambhadracharya saying that Awadhpuri is also mentioned in his Manas Tika, not of any particular place
 doha shatak ke saboot ko jilani ne khaarij karte hue kaha ki iske tulsikrut hone kaa saboot nahin diya gaya
 Skandpuran mentions the distance and distance of the birthplace of Ram in Ayodhya division, but now the place is not found in the Purana
 justise bobade ne kaha ki ayodhya main ram janm ko lekar aapkaa vivaad nahin? sirf janmasthan ko lekar he? is par jilani ne kaha ji bilkul
 Justice Bobde asked that you consider Ram Chabootare as Ram's birthplace? so jilani ne kaha ji haa, pehle sabhi yahi maanate rahe hai
 The Skandapurana states that the birthplace is at such a distance from such and such a place
 lekin ab wo sthaan astitv main nahin he
 Jilani said that in 1886, the district judge, in his decision, had allowed Ram Chabutara to worship there as the birthplace
 1886 ke faisle main ye bhi kaha gaya ki chabutara hi janmasthan he
 But later Hindus claim the inner courtyard and dome building, describing the temple as a birthplace
 bobade ne poocha - aap maanate hai ki is faisle ko kisi ne chunauti nahin di? jilani ne kaha ki hamane to chunauti nahin di
 But later a lot of writ were filed
 par ve ise chunauti dete hue nahin balki adhikaar ko lekar thim
 Jilani said that the Hindus wanted to build a temple on the platform only after the right to worship in the 1886 decision
 par tab ke jila court ne isaki ijazat nahin di thi
 Referring to the statement of witness Satyanarayana Tripathi, Jilani said that only Ayodhya is mentioned in the mind, not of Ram's birthplace
 ek gavaah ne dasharath ke mahal main ramajanm hone kaa zikr kiya he, par mahal kii sthiti kaa pataa nahin
 Justice Chandrachud said that the witnesses have cited the scriptures as saying that the birthplace of Sri Rama is 200 steps away in the fire of Sitakup
 jilani ne nakshaa bataate hue kaha ki janmasthan or sita coop ke uttar-dakshin kaa bhi zikr he, lekin janmasthan mandir, or chabutare ko maan rahe the
 The Hindus then changed their faith and started claiming both places
 jilani ne kaha ki ek gavaah ne bhi bataaya ki kavitawali or anya granthon main bhi ram janm ayodhya yaa avadhpuri yaa saket main hone kaa zikr he, par vishisht janmasthan kaa nahin
 The witnesses also could not tell the distance and direction of the disputed site from Vashisht Kund, Lomash Kund, Vidhaneshwar Ganesh and Pindarak
 valmiki ramayana main bhi koi vishisht sthaan nahin bataaya gaya
 The Ramcharit Manas was composed almost 70 years after the mosque was built, but there is no mention that the place of Ram's birth is where the mosque is
 yani janm sthaan ko lekar hinduon kii aasthaa bhi baad main badal gai
 Justice Bobde asked whether Babur broke the temple and built a mosque, had there ever been a temple or built a mosque in that place? On this question, Jilani said that Babur built a mosque on an empty plot
 agar pehle mandir rahaa hoga, to babar ko isaki jaankaree na ho
 Jilani said that ain-i-akbari also mentions not the birthplace of Ram but the holy city of Awadh, where Hindus worship Rama
 justise bhushan ne jilani ko tokaa ki skandapurana kaa hawala to aapke gavaah ne bhi diya he jisamen usne ram janmasthan kii baat kahi he
 Jilani said that Skanda Purana was published in the 18th century
 justise bhushan ne kaha ki baat publish kii nahin, puraana ke lekhan kii baat karen
 Your witness had said that it was written in the sixth century that it probably came into existence even before that
 justise chandrachud ne kaha ki aapaki daleel janmasthan kaa zikr nahin hone se he? jilani ne kaha ki haa vahaan masjid ko babari kaha jaae yaa nahin
 It is more important that Hindus did not worship in that structure
 jilani ne kaha ki masjid jahaan bani vahaan mandir nahin tha, mandir sarayu ke kinare tha
 He also says that the birthplace temple was in Ramkot, i
e
 the fort
 justise bobade ne poocha ki in-e-akabari main masjid kaa zikr nahin he? jilani ne kaha ki hinduon kaa yah daawa galat he ki mandir todakar masjid banaai gai
 Justice Bobde asked Ramkot, where is the fort? Jilani said that it was a wall built around the entire city
 lekin ab to vah ek mohalla kaa naam he
 The fort is on the map itself
 nakshe main durg bhi likhaa he
 On this, the court showed the map that a small part has been described as a fortification in the map
 jilani ne kaha ki nadi ke kinare ek bangala tha
 He must have been called Fortress
 trephen theller jaise kuch yatriyon ne bhi fortes kaa zikr kiya he lekin wo or he
 Justice Bobde asked whether Ram's birthplace had an exit location? Jilani said no
 bobade ne phir poocha ki to ram chabutare ko janmasthan maanate hai? jilani ne kaha ki haa, hindu bhi yahi maanate hai
 The hearing was then adjourned till Wednesday

 Ashwin Krishna Shraddha is performed from Pratipada to Amavasya
 is saal shraadh kii shuruyaat 28 sitambar se shuru ho chuki he
 Shraddha has been given a special status in Indian culture
 shraadh kya he? shraadh kyon karen? shraadh kii kya aavashyaktaa he? in prashnon par vichaar karen, to kai upyogi baaten saamne aati hai
 You will know that Shraddha means devotional expression, which is done to the delight of the gods, great men, sages, gurus and ancestral men
 vaarshik shraadh bhi jo kiye jate hai, usamen shraddhabhaav kaa, pitru purushon ke upakaaron ke liye unke prati aabhaar vyakt karne kii bhakthi bhaavana pradarshit karne kaa praytn kiya jaataa he
 In all these efforts, they are worshiped with pinddaan from Vedic legislation along with their worship and worship for the fulfillment of the ancestors
 pind to pratik bhar hote hai, asli samparn shraddha-bhaavana hi hoti he
 The same becomes the medium to please the ancestors, gods, sages and great men
 har din, har pal kiye jaaen shradhvaise shraadh jab bhi kiya jaae, uttam he
 a full 365 days of twelve months is better if reverence for the deities
 puja-upasna jitani adhik ho, utana acha
 The more devoted devotion to god-pitradi, the happier it is, the better
 pitrupaksh kaa shraadh aisa he ki nity yadi shraddharpan na ban pade, to naimitthik sahi, karte rahanaa chahie
 The real reverence is the daily worship of the deity, the worship of the ancestors, the worship of the sage spirits and the worship of the God of truth
 yah jitna adhik ho sake, utana hi satya kii nikatataa praapt hone kaa avasar miltaa he
 We should strive for this maximum devotion
 shraddha yadi satya ko chhu le, to samajhnaa chahie shraadh dhanya ho gaya
 What did you do once a year in Shraddha? The obeisance should be at all times, every moment, every moment
 hamen dev purushon, pitar purushon, divyatmaon or ishwariya satta ke jitna adhik ashish mili, utana hi ahobhagya he
 Along with Shraddha, there is one more thing worth talking about
 ham ishwar yaa pitar purushon se sukh saubhaahgya kii kaamana karte hai
 Good luck does not come from God alone
 unke rachit is suvistrut nisarg main bhi vah maujuud he, jo panch mahabhuton se nirmit he
 Earth is closest to us in these ghosts, just the basis of habitat and food
 isamen ann jal hi nahin, vriksh vanaspati bhi hamaare jivit va swasth rahane main sahaayak hote hai
 Along with Shraddh, we also plant trees and plants
 The oxygen released from tree vegetation protects and nourishes our lives
 is drushti se hamaara bhi kartavya banataa he ki vriksh vanaspatiyon kii kami na aae, isliye vriksharopan karte rahanaa chahie
 Although the people living in forest areas may find its utility less useful, but go to the desert and see what is the importance of trees
 jab tapati ret kii asay ooshmaa se jaan nikal rahi hoti he, tabhi hari-bhari dharti ke sushital anchal kii mahatta samaj main aati he
 That is why the order of planting trees should also be done along with Shradh
 jis tarah pitar hamaare paalak poshak hai, usee tarah vriksh bhi hamaare jivan rakshak hai
 Without them, happiness cannot be a possibility of any kind
 shraadh ke avasar par ham ek taraf pitaron, dev atmaaon or rishi atmaaon ko shraddha arpit karen, to duusari taraf ek-ek paudha bhi dharti kii godi main ropit karte jaaen
 There will be greenery, only then we will remain and we will get the opportunity to perform the reverential-shraddha deeds that bring us closer to the truth

 This book is an exploration of the Ganges, which is a lifeline in our history and mythology
 jiske kinare hajaaron varshon se sabhyataa or samskritiyaan panapati rahi hai
 Which is the basic basis of life, which is revered
 lekin aadhuniktaa kii daud main yah poojya nadi apana jeevandaayee rup khoti ja rahi he
 Coming out of the lap of the mountains and coming to the field, its form changes

 All the waste that has come out of the machinery of development is going into the Ganges and Ganga is becoming known Ganga by every name in the name of Har Ganga
 is kitaab kii sabase badi khaasiyat isaki style he
 The increasing pollution in the Ganges is not new and shocking news
 is bare main kaaphi kuch likhaa ja chukaa he
 Therefore, any writing about Ganga pollution at first sight gives the impression of being a dry journalistic writing
 lekin is kitaab ke saath aisa nahin he
 This book is a description of a long journey in search of the Ganges, so it has glimpses from travelogues to memoirs
 lekhak dway ne ganga ke udgam sthal se shuru karke un sabhi shaharon kaa safar tay kiya he, jahaan-jahaan se hokar yah nadi guzarati he
 The authors have traveled from Gangotri, Uttarkashi, Tehri, Devprayag, Rishikesh, Garhmukteshwar, Narora, Kanpur, Allahabad, Vindhyachal, Buxar, Patna and Kolkata to Gangasagar in the book
 yun to ganga bahut saare shaharon se hokar guzarati he, lekin donon lekhakon ne bahut soch-samajhakar tees shaharon kaa chunaav kiya he
 These are the cities from which the Ganges loses its true nature as it passes
 or usamen sabhyataa ke dooshit rang ghulte jate hai
 The book contains stories about the state of the river in these cities as well as their socio-cultural surroundings and interesting events that took place during the journey
 kisi kahani kii tarah is yatra vrittant main charitra hai, kisse hai, sthaneey lokkathaayen or kinvadantiyaan hai
 Writers have also tried to examine the history of civilizations settled along the banks of the Ganges
 yah jaananaa kaaphi rochak he ki jo shahar or gaanv nadi ke kinare sadiyon se rahete aa rahe hai, unka rahan-sahan, samskruti or puja-archana ke tareeke anya jagahon kii tulana main kis tarah bhinn hai
 Anupam Mishra, an environmentalist and Gandhian activist, talks about Ganga, “ganga by ganga shows the whole Ganges
 yah ganga kii gaharaari bhi bataati he or hamaare aadhunik vikaas kaa uthalaapan bhi
 It gives a wonderful enjoyment of the idea journey from Gangotri to Gangasagar
 saath hi ek ajeeb-si udaasi bhi
 Sad because the reader is unable to accept the end of this journey by heart
 ”bahut saral bhashaa main or rochak dhang se likhi gai yah kitaab kai gambhir prashn uthaati he
 For example, in the Tehri where the most powerful stream of Ganga flows, why do we have to get drinking water from tankers
 jin maidani ilaakon ke bhugol ko ganga itnaa sundar rup detii he, vahi ilaake apni pyaari nadi ke prati itani krurta or anudaarataa se kyon bhare hue hai
 There is no opponent of development, but can we imagine a country where there will be no rivers, where there will be no Ganga
 yadi nahin to apni nadiyon ko bachaane ke liye ham kya kar rahe hai? On the occasion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi laying the foundation stone of the highway, Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda faced a strange situation today
 is kaarykram main maujuud bheed ne congress netaa ke khilaaf naare lagaae, jisase naaraaz hooda ne kaha ki vah aage se kabhi modi ke saath manch saajha nahin karenge
 After the speech of Union Minister of State for Transport Krishnapal Gujjar and Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, when the Hooda came to give a speech, the crowd shouted slogans against him and the Congress government
 is bich hooda ne pehle se taiyaar bhaashan ko jaldbaaji main padhanaa jari rakhaa tabhi vahaan helicopter se modi pahunche or bheed kaa abhivadan karte hue dhary banaae rakhane kii apil kii
 However, the crowd did not pay attention and continued to obstruct the Chief Minister's speech which could not be fully heard
 garm or umas bhare mausam ke bich police or anya suraksha agenciyon ko bheed ko kaabo karne main kaaphi dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Modi pressed the button of the remote and laid the foundation stone for the highway project, after which the crowd occupied the media space when he started his speech

 chaara ghotaale ke duusare maamle main 3
 The younger son of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, serving a 5-year sentence and former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav, has been angry with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and the BJP since he went to power
 tejasvi kaa aarope he ki unke pita ko chaara ghotaale main nitish or bijepi ne milakar fansaa diya he
 Significantly, since his ouster from power, Hailu Prasad and his family have named Nitish as "palturam"
 ab tejasvi chaahate hai ki raajnneeti main palati maarane ke liye nitish kumaar ko aword se bhi nawaja janaa chahie
 In fact, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was awarded the first Mufti Award for Probity in Politics and Public Life in Jammu on Monday for purity in politics
 nitish ko yah sammaan jammu or kashmir ke rajyapal en en vohara dwaara jammu vishvavidhyalay ke general joravar singh auditorium main yojit kaarykram main diya gaya

 Taking a dig at Twitter, Tejashwi Yadav wrote to Nitish Kumar, "who would have got the most overturning award in politics?"
 twitor ke jariye tejasvi yadav ne sidhe-sidhe nitish kumaar par hamalaa bolaa
 Actually, after being ousted from power, Lalu and his family have been constantly addressing Nitish as Palatu Ram
 tejasvi kaa maananaa heki jis tareeke se nitish kumaar ne 2013 main bhaajapa se gathbandhan todakar uske baad argedy ke saath gathbandhan kar liya or 2015 main sarkaar banaai or 20 maheene ke baad argedy se gathbandhan todakar phir se bhaajapa ke saath gathbandhan karke sarkaar bana lee, yah nitish ke palaturam hone kaa saboot he
 If anyone should get the award for the most overturning in politics, then Nitish should get it

 Chinmayanand's lawyer says that we are fully cooperating in the investigation and may have to come again
 upi police ne chinmayanand se sawaal kiye, lekin rape ke maamle main koi bhi exiaar darj nahin hui
 It is known that the Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted in the case of Chinmayananda had on Wednesday conducted a medical examination of the alleged victim
 vishesh jaanch dal chinmayanand (chinmayananda) par balaatkaar kaa aarope lagane vaali ellem kii chaatra ko kadi suraksha ke bich medical college lekar pahunchaa tha

 He said that a conspiracy is going on against him and everything will become clear after the investigation by the SIT
 is bich, chinmayanand kaa ek ladki se maalish karaane kaa ek video viral hua
 In the description of the video posted, it is written that the girl was massaging the video with a camera in glasses

 research ke mutabik pataa laga he ki bastar ke log sharir ke pramukh ang liver ko prabhavit karne vaali pilia beemaari kaa ilaaj vahaan paayi jane vaali cheentee (chapada) se karte hai
 Actually, these ants contain formic acid
 cheentee pilia peedit marijon ko dank maarthi he to inamen maujuud billrubin (pittajnak) rasinic kriya ke jariye bilubardin main badal jaati he
 This causes yellowing of the body of the jaundice patient
 bastar vishvavidhyalay kii ek research scoler madhavi tiwari bastar ke logon se chapada cheentee se pilia kaa ilaaj karne kii manyata ko parakhane liye research kar rahi hai
 The scientific name of the chapara ant is Ecophila Smarga Dina
 bastaravasi sirf pilia hi nahin balki saath hi pet kii bimariyon ke liye bhi chapada kii chatnee kaa istemaal karte hai
 Actually, raktaras have a color called bilerubine, whose quantity increases the color of the skin and mucus
 aamtaur par raktaras main billrubin kaa str ek pratishat yaa isse kam hota he lekin jab isaki maatra 2
 Becomes above 5 percent
 isi sthiti ko pilia kehete hai
 Madhavi Tiwari says that the tribals leave ants called chapada on the victim's body to cure jaundice
 adhyayan main pataa chalaa he ki chapada ke dank se sharir main banane vaale pingnamentation kaa rang badal jaataa he, jisase sharir main peelaapan kam hota dikhaai detaa he
 Madhavi has used it on the jaundice victims with the help of sarpanches in Badamurama, Golapalli and Karanji in Bastar
 bastar ke adivaasiyon ke bhojan ke saath chapada kii chatnee (laal chinten) khaastaur par lajij or aushadhiy maani jaati hai
 Chapada chutney is so liked in the village that it is also sold in the haat-bazaar of Bastar
 gaanv waalon kaa maananaa he ki is chapada chatnee ke seven se malaria, dengue or bukhaar bhi thik ho jaataa he
 The villagers go to the forest and spread the tree branches under the tree, spoon, cloth or anything, causing the chapada to fall down and they are collected and sold in the market or used for making chutneys
 input- IANS Abdul Karim Telgi, a 20-million-crore fake stamp paper scam convict, has died
 police sutron ke mutabik telgi ke sharir ke kai angon ne kaam karnaa band kar diya tha, jiske chalate uski bangaleru main maut ho gai
 He was admitted to the Victoria Hospital in Bangalore four days ago due to suffering from meningitis
 vahaan use ventilator main rakhaa gaya tha
 Earlier, according to the Medical Bulletin of Victoria Hospital, Bangalore, many organs of Abdul Karim Telgi stopped functioning
 uske swasthya main koi sudhaar hota nahin dikh rahaa tha
 It said that there was no improvement in his condition since Wednesday
 uski haalat lagaataar bigadati chali gai thi
 On Thursday morning, Telgi's lawyer MT Nanaiya had said that he is alive, but his condition is critical
 use victoria aspataal main bhartee karavaaya gaya he
 He is in the ICU and is placed on a ventilator
 vah mastishk fever se peedit hai
 He told that Telgi was admitted to the hospital four days ago
 vakil ne lagaaya deree se bhartee karaane kaa aropatelgi ke vakil ne aarope lagaaya, ‘‘use thodaa or jaldi bhartee karavaaya janaa chahie tha 
 It was delayed
 ’’ maaloom ho ki telgi ko november 2001 main ajmer se giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 He was suffering from diabetes and hypertension for the last 20 years
 use aids samet kai rog the
 He is guilty of 20 thousand crores stamp scam, he was sentenced to 30 years rigorous imprisonment in fake stamp paper scam of 20 thousand crores
 vah bengaluru ke parappana agrahara central jail main sajaa kaat rahaa tha
 He was also fined Rs 202 crores
 
 
 
 When Telgihal was engulfed in controversies, Telgi was engulfed in controversies when former DIG (imprisonment) d Rupa alleged that the jail administration used to give him facilities in the jail
 telgi ko court ne stamp paper ghotaalaa ke maamle main 2007 se 30 saal tak sashram karawas kii sajaa sunai thi
 Nowadays you will hear a lot of controversy about the office of profit
 khabar he ki chunaav ayog ne aam aadmi party ke 21 vidhayakon ko 14 july ko apana paksh rakhane ke liye bulaayaa he
 If found guilty by the Election Commission, then they can be subscribed
 yah maamla dilli main aam aadmi party banaam bhartiya janata party banaam congress party bana hua he
 The President of India will take a decision on this after the Election Commission report
 raashtrapati is maamle main kendriya mantriparishad se raay nahin lete hai
 In this case only the Election Commission can send its report
 samvidhan kii tamaam vyakhyaaon ke anusaar offis of profit ke maamle main kanoonee rup se centre sarkaar yaa mantriparishad kaa koi role nahin he
 The Aam Aadmi Party had made a law and sent it to the President but the President did not approve
 ab yah maamla dilli sarkaar ke upar talwaar kii tarah latak rahaa he
 Through this controversy, we have a chance for you to understand again how the elected representative has been conceived in the Constitution so that he remains independent of the government and responsible to the people of his constituency
 ham or aap jab bhi kisi saansad yaa vidhayak ko dekhte hai to hameshaa use satta paksh yaa vipaksh ke pratinidhi ke rup main dekhte hai
 But the Lok Sabha or the Legislative Assembly does not view its members as representatives of the government
 sadan kii kalpana is par aadhaarit he ki vidhayak yaa saansad uske bheetar janata kii awaz hai
 Only members who are ministers in the house are considered to be the voice or representative of the government
 samvidhan ne aisi kalpana kii he ki vidhayak yaa saansad sarkaar ke kisi bhi prakaar ke prabhaav main na aae
 For this, it is necessary that he should not accept such a post from where he will get the facility of salary, etc
, which gives him a chance to share in power and which comes under the direct patronage of the government on which the government should settle
 aisa isliye kiya gaya he ki sadan main vidhayak yaa saansad sirf janata kii numaaindgi karen
 The government has many positions
 wo har pad main apane saansadon ko bitha sakati he, vidhayakon ko de sakati he
 If this happens, the government's representation in the House will increase and the people's representation in the House will decrease
 dhyaan rakhiyegaa ki sadan ke hi sadsy mantri hote hai jinaki kuch nishchit sankhya hoti he
 But for all the members not to be ministers or chairman, it is only the office of profit has been conceived so that their membership can be canceled
 samvidhan nirmaataa samajhate the ki agar vidhayak yaa saansad sarkaar ke prabhaav yaa sangrakshan main aa gaya to wo swatantra nahin rah paaegaa
 The member should come under the influence of no one within the House
 ye adarsh vyavastha he
 Practical arrangement is something else
 paise lekar sawaal poochne ke aarope main hamaare nirvaachit pratinidhiyon ne sadsyta ganvaane kaa itihaas banaaya he
 There is no benefit from taking the name of the party
 aap dekh hi rahe hai ki rajya sabha ke chunaav main vidhayak kis tarah se dhan ke prabhaav main apana vot idhar se udhar kar rahe hai
 Some people serve the party in elections, then they come from Rajya Sabha to the Legislative Council
 pehle party ko apane profit main se kuch dete hai phir us party kii sarkaar se offis le lete hai
 Do you give or not to such a member, can you in any way keep yourself free from the morality of the office of profit
 kai dalon ne aise sadasyon ko sadan main bheja he jo bina offis of profit liye sarkaar ko bhi prabhavit kar rahe hai or sadan ke bheetar niti nirmaan par bhi asar daal rahe hai
 On 21 August 1954, GV Mavalankar Saheb, the first speaker of the Lok Sabha, consulted the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha and formed a committee for the Office of Profit
 is cameti ke adhyaksh the pandit thakur das bhargav jinke kaaran ise bhargav cameti ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Bhargava Saheb was the MP of Hisar
 cameti ne suzav diya ki ek vyapak bill laakar saaf kiya jaae ki koun sa pad laabh kaa pad he or koun sa laabh kaa pad nahin he
 Keep in mind that this work is not done by the government, but the Joint Committee of Parliament
 tab se lekar har loksabhaa ke dauraan sanyukt cameti banati he or laabh ke pad ko paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Members who accept the post of profit lose their membership
 sarkaar saarvajanik upkram ko aadesh bhi detii he ki agar koi saansad unki cameti kaa sadsy he to use kisi bhi prakaar kaa vetan na diya jaae
 How beautiful the freedom of the Members of Parliament or Assembly has been imagined
 jaanboojh kar kalpana kaha kyonki jo kaha he gaya kya wo aksharsh: saakaar hua he yaa ho rahaa he? jaise kisi vidheyak par matdaan se pehle sadan parisar main hi sansadeey dal kii baithak main samuhik faisla le liya jaataa he
 mps or mlas do not speak apart from the party line
 sadsy samuhik faisle ke saath jaaen isliye wheep laga diya jaataa he
 Therefore, even if you understand how far the basic spirit of Office is applicable, you will not be able to do anything
 raajnneetik vyavastha aapke samaj jane se nahin badalati he
 Politics changes you
 zaruri he ki ham offis or profit kii paribhaasha ko samajhen
 Office is the government department through which you work for the society
 uske badale vetan or anya bhatte milte hai
 Travel allowance or or some expenses are not included
 paise kaa len-dein hona iske centre main he
 Not every post comes under the purview of Office of Profit
 hamen yah samajhnaa hoga ki koi sarkaar apane vidhayakon yaa saansadon ko pad dekar us par kis had tak apana prabhaav kaayam karti he
 According to the edited book by PDT Acharya, the Supreme Court has prescribed certain tests to determine the office of profit
 pehle test hota he ki offis he yaa nahin
 Then there is a test whether the profit has been made or not
 sabase bada test is baat ko lekar hota he ki kya sarkaar niyukti karti he
 It will be seen that the government does not act like the boss of the legislator, that is, he can dismiss, remove and control the work from that post
 kya sarkaar use vetan aadi maudrik bhugtan karti he
 This proves that there is a government office or not
 iske baad profit kaa test hota he
 The MLA was appointed to the post of Mayor of Pondicherry
 chunaav ayog ne offis of profit mana kyonki kai tarah ke bhatte milte the
 But this was not accepted as the post of mayor does not come under the control of the government
 isliye isaki koi ek vyakhya nahin dikhti he
 Now come on the matter of making 21 mlas of Aam Aadmi Party as Parliamentary Secretaries
 baad main dilli vidhansabha ne ek vidheyak bhi paas kar vyavastha di ki mukhyamantri or mantriyon ke sansadeey sachiv kaa pad grahan karne par unki sadsyta nahin jaaegi, kyonki ye laabh ke pad nahin hai
 The Assembly passed it but the President did not approve
 yah bhi ek masalaa he
 Can the President finally return or can he still address his doubts and send the Lt
 Governor again
 2006 main bhi aisa ek maamla hua tha
 At that time, Sheila Dikshit gave various types of posts to the 19 Congress mlas in Delhi
 sansadeey sachiv se lekar trans-yamuna Area Development Board ke chairman,vaais chairman, gramin vikaas board vagairah
 After the appointment, the Election Commission sent a notice of office of profit to these 19 mlas
 shila dikshit apni sarkaar bachaane ke liye ek bill le ain or 14 karyaalayon ko offis of profit kii list se baahar kar diya
 Sheila Dixit had said that it is my right to save my government, we are constitutionally doing so
 aise hi bill chhattisgarh or jharkhand main paas kiye gaye hai
 Sheila's bill was returned by President Kalam on 31 May 2006
 shila dikshit ne dobaaraa bheja or raashtrapati ne manzuri de di
 Then there was a single party government at the Center and Delhi
 ab sthiti alag he
 The Aam Aadmi Party had come to do new politics against the Congress culture
 itane vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv banane kii kya zarurat tha yaa wo kaam kyon kiya jo shila dikshit kar chuki thim
 BJP had protested even then, is still protesting
 saansad minakshi lekhi ne press conference kar kaha tha ki dilli kii vishesh sanvaidhanik vyavastha he
 This is a city, not a state
 is shahar main keval 7 mantri ho sakate hai or 7 ke upar 21 sachiv lagaaye jate hai
 The appointment of 21 mlas is illegal
 kanoon main isaki koi vyavastha hi nahin he
 The Parliamentary Secretary is part of the executive
 aap us tantra ko niyantrit kar sakate hai
 Therefore, it is a term of profit
 bhale aap koi selary na le rahe hon
 The comments sansadeey sachiv kyon banaae jate hai, kyonki kanoon mantriyon kii sankhya vidhaan sabha ke sadasyon kii sankhya kaa 15 fisadi hi ho saktaa he
 It is 10% in Delhi
 ye isliye kiya gaya he ki mantriyon kii sankhya adhik na ho jaae or sarkaar par boj na pade
 But you see that the status of Minister of State is distributed among all the states
 gaadi, guard lekar vidhayak ji kshetra main flash karte rahete hai
 Many people are made secretaries and so on
 haryana main 13 mantri hai magar vahaan 4 mukhya sansadeey sachiv hai
 In Rajasthan also 5 mlas have been made Parliamentary Secretaries
 gujarat main bhi 5 sansadeey sachiv hai
 In the previous government, Mamata Banerjee made 24 legislators as parliamentary secretaries
 ve iske liye kanoon bhi lekar ain, lekin 2013 main ek janhit yachika daayar hui
 The Calcutta High Court rejected Mamata Banerjee's law as unconstitutional and canceled the appointment of 24 mlas
 lekin unki sadsyta nahin gai
 While these mlas had been parliamentary secretaries
 2006 main chhattisgarh sarkaar ne privansion of disqualification amendament bill laakar 90 padon ko offis of profit se baahar kar diya
 Now there is a ruckus in Delhi and Ajit Jogi in Chhattisgarh has started demanding that 11 parliamentary secretaries be removed by the BJP government
 congress ise lekar bijepi par dohare maandand kaa aarope laga rahi he jabaki 2006 main dilli main hi uski sarkaar aisa kar chuki he
 We and you always look at any MP or MLA as a representative of the ruling party or opposition
 lekin loksabhaa yaa vidhansabha apane sadasyon ko sarkaar ke pratinidhi ke taur par nahin dekhati he
 The imagination of the House is based on whether the MLA or MP is the voice of the public within it
 sadan main jo sadsy mantri hai sirf unhen hi sarkaar kii awaz yaa pratinidhi mana jaataa he
 The Constitution has envisaged that mlas or mps should not come under any influence of the government
 iske liye zaruri he ki wo aisa pad sweekaar na kare jahaan se use vetan aadi kii suvidha mili, jisase usase satta main hissedaar hone kaa mauka mili or jo sarkaar ke sidhe sangrakshan main aa jaae jis par sarkaar kaa bas chale
 This has been done so that the MLA or MP represents only the public in the House
 sarkaar ke paas anek pad hote hai
 She can seat her mps in every post, give them to mlas
 agar aisa hua to sadan main sarkaar kaa pratinidhitiv bad jayega or sadan main janata kaa pratinidhitiv ghat jayega
 Keep in mind that only members of the House are ministers who have a certain number
 magar saare sadsy mantri yaa chairman na ho jaaen iske liye hi offis of profit kii kalpana kii gai he taaki unki sadsyta radd kii ja sake
 The constitution makers believed that if the MLA or MP came under the influence or protection of the government, they would not be able to remain independent
 sadan ke bheetar sadsy ko bina kisi ke prabhaav main aana chahie
 This is the ideal system
 vyaavhaarik vyavastha kuch or he
 Our elected representatives have made a history of losing membership on the charge of asking questions about money
 dal kaa naam lene se koi laabh nahin
 You are seeing how the mlas are moving their vote from here and there under the influence of money in Rajya Sabha elections
 kuch log chunaav main party kii seva kar dete hai phir ve rajya sabha se lekar vidhaan parishad main aa jate hai
 First give some of his profit to the party and then take office from the government of that party
 aise sadsy ko aap pad de yaa na den, kya kisi bhi tarah se aap offis of profit kii naitikta se mukt rakh sakate hai
 Many parties have sent such members to the House who are also influencing the government without taking office of profit and are also influencing the policy making within the House
 21 agast, 1954 ko loksabhaa ke pehle spikar ji ve maavlankar sahab ne rajya sabha ke chairman se mashwara kar offis of profit ke liye ek cameti banaai
 The chairman of this committee was Pandit Thakur Das Bhargava due to which it is known as Bhargava Committee
 bhargav sahab hisar ke saansad the
 The committee suggested that by bringing a comprehensive bill, it should be clarified which post is a post of profit and which is not a post of profit
 dhyaan rahe yah kaam sarkaar nahin karti he balki sansad kii sanyukt samiti karti he
 Since then, a joint committee is formed during every Lok Sabha and the post of profit is defined
 jo sadsy laabh ke pad ko sweekaar karte hai unki sadsyta chali jaati he
 The government also orders the public sector undertaking not to pay any kind of salary if an MP is a member of their committee
 sansad yaa vidhansabha ke sadasyon kii swatantraaa kii kitni kuubasurat kalpana kii gai he
 Deliberately imagined because what has been said, has it come true or is it happening? Like, before a vote on a bill, a collective decision is taken in a meeting of the parliamentary party in the House premises
 saansad yaa vidhayak party line se alag nahin bolte
 Whip is imposed so that members go with the collective decision
 isliye offis of profit kii mul bhaavana kahaan tak lagu he ise aap samaj bhi lenge to kuch nahin kar paaenge
 The political system does not change with your understanding
 raajnneeti aapako hi badal detii he
 It is important that we understand the definition of office and profit
 offis wo sarkari vibhaag he jiske zariye aap samaaj ke liye kaam karte hai
 In return, he gets salary and other allowances
 yatra bhatta yaa yaa kuch kharch isamen shaamil nahin he
 Transaction of money is at its center
 har pad offis of profit ke daayre main nahin aata he
 We have to understand to what extent a government exercises its influence on its mlas or mps
 pi di tii acharya kii sampadit kitaab ke anusaar supreme court ne offis of profit nirdhaarit karne ke liye kuch test nirdhaarit kiye hai
 The first test is whether the office is there or not
 phir test hota he ki profit hua yaa nahin
 The biggest test is whether the government is hiring 
 yah dekha jayega ki sarkaar vidhayak ke bos kii tarah kaam to nahin karti yani use us pad se barkhaast kar sakati he, hataa sakati he or kaam par niyantran rakh sakati he
 Does the government pay him monetary wages etc
 isse sabit hota he ki sarkari offis hota he yaa nahin
 This is followed by a test of profit
 pandicherry ke meyar ke pad par vidhayak kii niyukti hui
 The Election Commission considered Office of Profit as many allowances
 magar ise nahin mana gaya kyonki meyar kaa pad sarkaar ke niyantran main nahin aata he
 Therefore, there does not appear to be a single explanation for this
 ab aate hai aam aadmi party ke 21 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv banane ke maamle par
 Later, the Delhi Legislative Assembly also passed a bill stipulating that their membership of the Chief Minister and Ministers would not be taken on assuming the post of Parliamentary Secretary, as these are not posts of profit
 vidhansabha ne ise paas kar diya magar raashtrapati ne manzuri nahin di
 This is also an issue
 kya raashtrapati ne antim rup se lautaa diya yaa abhi bhi unki shankaaon kaa samaadhaan kar up rajyapal dobaaraa bhej sakate hai
 a similar case took place in 2006 as well
 tab dilli main shila dikshit ne congress ke 19 vidhayakon ko kai prakaar ke pad diye the
 From Parliamentary Secretary to Chairman of trans-yamuna Area Development Board, Vice Chairman, Rural Development Board, etc
 niyukti ke baad chunaav ayog ne in 19 vidhayakon ko offis of profit kaa notice bhej diya
 Sheila Dixit brought out a bill to save her government and excluded 14 offices from the list of Office of Profit
 shila dikshit ne kaha tha ki meri sarkaar bachaana meraa haq he, ham sanvaidhanik taur par aisa kar rahe hai
 Similar bills have been passed in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand
 raashtrapati kalam ne 31 may 2006 ko shila kaa yah bill waapas kar diya tha
 Sheila Dixit sent again and the President approved
 tab centre or dilli main ek hi party kii sarkaar thi
 Now the situation is different
 aam aadmi party to congress samskruti ke kilaaf nai raajnneeti karne ai thi
 Why did so many legislators need to be made parliamentary secretaries or did the work that Sheila Dixit had done
 bijepi ne tab bhi virodh kiya tha ab bhi virodh kar rahi he
 MP Meenakshi Lekhi had said in a press conference that Delhi has a special constitutional system
 ye rajya nahin, ek shahar he
 This city can have only 7 ministers and 21 secretaries are appointed on top of 7
 21 emele kii jo niyukti hui he, wo gaiyr-kanoonee he
 There is no system of law in this
 sansadeey sachiv karypalika kaa hissaa he
 You can control that mechanism
 isliye yah laabh kaa pad hota he
 Even if you are not taking any salary
 tippaniyan Why parliamentary secretaries are appointed, because the number of law ministers can be only 15 percent of the number of members of the Legislative Assembly
 dilli main ye 10 fisadi he
 This has been done so that the number of ministers does not increase and the government is not burdened
 lekin aap dekhte hai ki tamaam rajyon main rajya mantri kaa darja baant diya jaataa he
 The MLA keeps flashing in the area with a car, guard
 kai logon ko sachiv vagairah bana diya jaataa he
 Haryana has 13 ministers but there are 4 Chief Parliamentary Secretaries
 rajasthan main bhi 5 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv banaaya gaya he
 Gujarat also has 5 Parliamentary Secretaries
 pichhali sarkaar main mamata banerjee ne 24 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv bana diya tha
 She also brought legislation for this, but in 2013 a PIL was filed
 kalakatta hoicourt ne mamata banerjee ke us kanoon ko asanvaidhanik bataakar khaarij kar diya or 24 vidhayakon kii niyukti radd kar di
 But his membership did not go away
 jabaki ye vidhayak sansadeey sachiv rah chuke the
 In 2006, the Chhattisgarh government brought out the Prevention of Disqualification Amendment Bill and removed 90 posts from the Office of Profit
 ab dilli main hangaamaa hua to chhattisgarh main ajit jogi ne maang shuru kar di he ki jin 11 sansadeey sachivon ko hataaya jaae jise bijepi sarkaar ne niyukt kiye hai
 The Congress is accusing the BJP of having double standards, while its government in Delhi has done so in 2006
 ye adarsh vyavastha he
 Practical arrangement is something else
 paise lekar sawaal poochne ke aarope main hamaare nirvaachit pratinidhiyon ne sadsyta ganvaane kaa itihaas banaaya he
 There is no benefit from taking the name of the party
 aap dekh hi rahe hai ki rajya sabha ke chunaav main vidhayak kis tarah se dhan ke prabhaav main apana vot idhar se udhar kar rahe hai
 Some people serve the party in elections, then they come from Rajya Sabha to the Legislative Council
 pehle party ko apane profit main se kuch dete hai phir us party kii sarkaar se offis le lete hai
 Do you give or not to such a member, can you in any way keep yourself free from the morality of the office of profit
 kai dalon ne aise sadasyon ko sadan main bheja he jo bina offis of profit liye sarkaar ko bhi prabhavit kar rahe hai or sadan ke bheetar niti nirmaan par bhi asar daal rahe hai
 On 21 August 1954, GV Mavalankar Saheb, the first speaker of the Lok Sabha, consulted the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha and formed a committee for the Office of Profit
 is cameti ke adhyaksh the pandit thakur das bhargav jinke kaaran ise bhargav cameti ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Bhargava Saheb was the MP of Hisar
 cameti ne suzav diya ki ek vyapak bill laakar saaf kiya jaae ki koun sa pad laabh kaa pad he or koun sa laabh kaa pad nahin he
 Keep in mind that this work is not done by the government, but the Joint Committee of Parliament
 tab se lekar har loksabhaa ke dauraan sanyukt cameti banati he or laabh ke pad ko paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Members who accept the post of profit lose their membership
 sarkaar saarvajanik upkram ko aadesh bhi detii he ki agar koi saansad unki cameti kaa sadsy he to use kisi bhi prakaar kaa vetan na diya jaae
 How beautiful the freedom of the Members of Parliament or Assembly has been imagined
 jaanboojh kar kalpana kaha kyonki jo kaha he gaya kya wo aksharsh: saakaar hua he yaa ho rahaa he? jaise kisi vidheyak par matdaan se pehle sadan parisar main hi sansadeey dal kii baithak main samuhik faisla le liya jaataa he
 mps or mlas do not speak apart from the party line
 sadsy samuhik faisle ke saath jaaen isliye wheep laga diya jaataa he
 Therefore, even if you understand how far the basic spirit of Office is applicable, you will not be able to do anything
 raajnneetik vyavastha aapke samaj jane se nahin badalati he
 Politics changes you
 zaruri he ki ham offis or profit kii paribhaasha ko samajhen
 Office is the government department through which you work for the society
 uske badale vetan or anya bhatte milte hai
 Travel allowance or or some expenses are not included
 paise kaa len-dein hona iske centre main he
 Not every post comes under the purview of Office of Profit
 hamen yah samajhnaa hoga ki koi sarkaar apane vidhayakon yaa saansadon ko pad dekar us par kis had tak apana prabhaav kaayam karti he
 According to the edited book by PDT Acharya, the Supreme Court has prescribed certain tests to determine the office of profit
 pehle test hota he ki offis he yaa nahin
 Then there is a test whether the profit has been made or not
 sabase bada test is baat ko lekar hota he ki kya sarkaar niyukti karti he
 It will be seen that the government does not act like the boss of the legislator, that is, he can dismiss, remove and control the work from that post
 kya sarkaar use vetan aadi maudrik bhugtan karti he
 This proves that there is a government office or not
 iske baad profit kaa test hota he
 The MLA was appointed to the post of Mayor of Pondicherry
 chunaav ayog ne offis of profit mana kyonki kai tarah ke bhatte milte the
 But this was not accepted as the post of mayor does not come under the control of the government
 isliye isaki koi ek vyakhya nahin dikhti he
 Now come on the matter of making 21 mlas of Aam Aadmi Party as Parliamentary Secretaries
 baad main dilli vidhansabha ne ek vidheyak bhi paas kar vyavastha di ki mukhyamantri or mantriyon ke sansadeey sachiv kaa pad grahan karne par unki sadsyta nahin jaaegi, kyonki ye laabh ke pad nahin hai
 The Assembly passed it but the President did not approve
 yah bhi ek masalaa he
 Can the President finally return or can he still address his doubts and send the Lt
 Governor again
 2006 main bhi aisa ek maamla hua tha
 At that time, Sheila Dikshit gave various types of posts to the 19 Congress mlas in Delhi
 sansadeey sachiv se lekar trans-yamuna Area Development Board ke chairman,vaais chairman, gramin vikaas board vagairah
 After the appointment, the Election Commission sent a notice of office of profit to these 19 mlas
 shila dikshit apni sarkaar bachaane ke liye ek bill le ain or 14 karyaalayon ko offis of profit kii list se baahar kar diya
 Sheila Dixit had said that it is my right to save my government, we are constitutionally doing so
 aise hi bill chhattisgarh or jharkhand main paas kiye gaye hai
 Sheila's bill was returned by President Kalam on 31 May 2006
 shila dikshit ne dobaaraa bheja or raashtrapati ne manzuri de di
 Then there was a single party government at the Center and Delhi
 ab sthiti alag he
 The Aam Aadmi Party had come to do new politics against the Congress culture
 itane vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv banane kii kya zarurat tha yaa wo kaam kyon kiya jo shila dikshit kar chuki thim
 BJP had protested even then, is still protesting
 saansad minakshi lekhi ne press conference kar kaha tha ki dilli kii vishesh sanvaidhanik vyavastha he
 This is a city, not a state
 is shahar main keval 7 mantri ho sakate hai or 7 ke upar 21 sachiv lagaaye jate hai
 The appointment of 21 mlas is illegal
 kanoon main isaki koi vyavastha hi nahin he
 The Parliamentary Secretary is part of the executive
 aap us tantra ko niyantrit kar sakate hai
 Therefore, it is a term of profit
 bhale aap koi selary na le rahe hon
 The comments sansadeey sachiv kyon banaae jate hai, kyonki kanoon mantriyon kii sankhya vidhaan sabha ke sadasyon kii sankhya kaa 15 fisadi hi ho saktaa he
 It is 10% in Delhi
 ye isliye kiya gaya he ki mantriyon kii sankhya adhik na ho jaae or sarkaar par boj na pade
 But you see that the status of Minister of State is distributed among all the states
 gaadi, guard lekar vidhayak ji kshetra main flash karte rahete hai
 Many people are made secretaries and so on
 haryana main 13 mantri hai magar vahaan 4 mukhya sansadeey sachiv hai
 In Rajasthan also 5 mlas have been made Parliamentary Secretaries
 gujarat main bhi 5 sansadeey sachiv hai
 In the previous government, Mamata Banerjee made 24 legislators as parliamentary secretaries
 ve iske liye kanoon bhi lekar ain, lekin 2013 main ek janhit yachika daayar hui
 The Calcutta High Court rejected Mamata Banerjee's law as unconstitutional and canceled the appointment of 24 mlas
 lekin unki sadsyta nahin gai
 While these mlas had been parliamentary secretaries
 2006 main chhattisgarh sarkaar ne privansion of disqualification amendament bill laakar 90 padon ko offis of profit se baahar kar diya
 Now there is a ruckus in Delhi and Ajit Jogi in Chhattisgarh has started demanding that 11 parliamentary secretaries be removed by the BJP government
 congress ise lekar bijepi par dohare maandand kaa aarope laga rahi he jabaki 2006 main dilli main hi uski sarkaar aisa kar chuki he

 congress ise lekar bijepi par dohare maandand kaa aarope laga rahi he jabaki 2006 main dilli main hi uski sarkaar aisa kar chuki he
 It is important that we understand the definition of office and profit
 offis wo sarkari vibhaag he jiske zariye aap samaaj ke liye kaam karte hai
 In return, he gets salary and other allowances
 yatra bhatta yaa yaa kuch kharch isamen shaamil nahin he
 Transaction of money is at its center
 har pad offis of profit ke daayre main nahin aata he
 We have to understand to what extent a government exercises its influence on its mlas or mps
 pi di tii acharya kii sampadit kitaab ke anusaar supreme court ne offis of profit nirdhaarit karne ke liye kuch test nirdhaarit kiye hai
 The first test is whether the office is there or not
 phir test hota he ki profit hua yaa nahin
 The biggest test is whether the government appoints
 yah dekha jayega ki sarkaar vidhayak ke bos kii tarah kaam to nahin karti yani use us pad se barkhaast kar sakati he, hataa sakati he or kaam par niyantran rakh sakati he
 Does the government pay him monetary wages etc
 isse sabit hota he ki sarkari offis hota he yaa nahin
 This is followed by a test of profit
 pandicherry ke meyar ke pad par vidhayak kii niyukti hui
 The Election Commission considered Office of Profit as many allowances
 magar ise nahin mana gaya kyonki meyar kaa pad sarkaar ke niyantran main nahin aata he
 Therefore, there does not appear to be a single explanation for this
 ab aate hai aam aadmi party ke 21 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv banane ke maamle par
 Later, the Delhi Legislative Assembly also passed a bill stipulating that their membership of the Chief Minister and Ministers would not be taken on assuming the post of Parliamentary Secretary, as these are not posts of profit
 vidhansabha ne ise paas kar diya magar raashtrapati ne manzuri nahin di
 This is also an issue
 kya raashtrapati ne antim rup se lautaa diya yaa abhi bhi unki shankaaon kaa samaadhaan kar up rajyapal dobaaraa bhej sakate hai
 a similar case took place in 2006 as well
 tab dilli main shila dikshit ne congress ke 19 vidhayakon ko kai prakaar ke pad diye the
 From Parliamentary Secretary to Chairman of trans-yamuna Area Development Board, Vice Chairman, Rural Development Board, etc
 niyukti ke baad chunaav ayog ne in 19 vidhayakon ko offis of profit kaa notice bhej diya
 Sheila Dixit brought out a bill to save her government and excluded 14 offices from the list of Office of Profit
 shila dikshit ne kaha tha ki meri sarkaar bachaana meraa haq he, ham sanvaidhanik taur par aisa kar rahe hai
 Similar bills have been passed in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand
 raashtrapati kalam ne 31 may 2006 ko shila kaa yah bill waapas kar diya tha
 Sheila Dixit sent again and the President approved
 tab centre or dilli main ek hi party kii sarkaar thi
 Now the situation is different
 aam aadmi party to congress samskruti ke kilaaf nai raajnneeti karne ai thi
 Why did so many legislators need to be made parliamentary secretaries or did the work that Sheila Dixit had done
 bijepi ne tab bhi virodh kiya tha ab bhi virodh kar rahi he
 MP Meenakshi Lekhi had said in a press conference that Delhi has a special constitutional system

 21 emele kii jo niyukti hui he, wo gaiyr-kanoonee he
 There is no system of law in this
 sansadeey sachiv karypalika kaa hissaa he
 You can control that mechanism
 isliye yah laabh kaa pad hota he
 Even if you are not taking any salary
 tippaniyan Why parliamentary secretaries are appointed, because the number of law ministers can be only 15 percent of the number of members of the Legislative Assembly
 dilli main ye 10 fisadi he
 This has been done so that the number of ministers does not increase and the government is not burdened
 lekin aap dekhte hai ki tamaam rajyon main rajya mantri kaa darja baant diya jaataa he
 The MLA keeps flashing in the area with a car, guard
 kai logon ko sachiv vagairah bana diya jaataa he
 Haryana has 13 ministers but there are 4 Chief Parliamentary Secretaries
 rajasthan main bhi 5 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv banaaya gaya he
 Gujarat also has 5 Parliamentary Secretaries
 pichhali sarkaar main mamata banerjee ne 24 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv bana diya tha
 She also brought legislation for this, but in 2013 a PIL was filed
 kalakatta hoicourt ne mamata banerjee ke us kanoon ko asanvaidhanik bataakar khaarij kar diya or 24 vidhayakon kii niyukti radd kar di
 But his membership did not go away
 jabaki ye vidhayak sansadeey sachiv rah chuke the
 In 2006, the Chhattisgarh government brought out the Prevention of Disqualification Amendment Bill and removed 90 posts from the Office of Profit
 ab dilli main hangaamaa hua to chhattisgarh main ajit jogi ne maang shuru kar di he ki jin 11 sansadeey sachivon ko hataaya jaae jise bijepi sarkaar ne niyukt kiye hai

 Rial coach Zinedine Zidan is delighted with the thrilling win by Real Madrid at the Camp Nou, Barcelona's home ground on Saturday
 jidaan ke anusaar ye jeet lig satr main apane kharaab form se baahar nikalne ke nazariye se club ke liye ek nayaa mode ban sakati he
 Riyal beat Barcelona 2–1 in the famous el-clasico match thanks to a goal from Rialstar forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who won in El Clasico
 haalanki, is jeet ke baavjood club lig teble main tisare sthaan par he
 In this table, Real are seven points behind Barcelona and one point behind Atletico Madrid
 jidaan ne jeet ke baad kaha, 'hamen kadam dar kadam aage badhanaa hoga
 First we have to leave Atletico behind, then we will see what can happen
 ab bhi kuch match baaki hai
 ' pichley 6 saal se party ke pradesh adhyaksh the ashok tanvarhooda chunaav samiti adhyaksh ke saath sielpi ke netaa bhi hongeharyana vidhansabha chunaav sir par hai, lekin jis tarah se pradesh main congress ke diggajon ke alag sur sunai de rahe the usase yahi sandesh ja rahaa tha ki baaji party ke haath se nikalati ja rahi he
 bjp's faith in Haryana has been reflected in the fact that it has been proclaiming 75 crosses this time
 yani 90 sadasyeey main bijepi 75 se zyada siten jeetne kii baat kar rahi he
 At the same time, news came out from the Congress about the factions being divided and scattered
 aise main purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda kaa lead role main aana or haryana pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh pad se ashok tanvar kii chuttee se saaf jaahir he ki team sonia gandhi kii chali he
 It is not hidden from anyone that Ashok Tanwar is Rahul Gandhi's choice
 tamaam rassakashi ke baavjood wo pichley 6 saal se party ke pradesh adhyaksh bane rahe or to or ashok tanvar khud bhi sabko yah bataa chuke the ki vah kahin nahin jane vaale or unheen ke netritv main party chunaav ladegi, lekin siyasat ne baaji palatate time nahin lagata
 Actually, Bhupendra Singh Hooda has always felt difficulty in keeping track with Tanwar's attitude
 unhen ye bhi malaal rahaa ki unki varishthata ko zyada tavajjo nahin di ja rahi thi or to or ashok tanvar rahul gandhi ko report karte the
 It may have hurt Hooda's honor and since then, he was cold
 hooda or tanvar ke bich khinchataan ne uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav se pehle tool pakad liya tha
 At that time, there was a fierce scuffle between Hooda and Tanwar supporters during the Congress's Delhi Vikas Yatra from Deoria
 tab tanvar ko bhi chot ai thi
 He also got a case registered against Bhupendra Hooda
 us vakt rahul gandhi ne tanvar ko saport kiya
 It was Rahul's blessing that despite Hooda's opposition, Tanwar continued to hold the post of state party president
 magar ab sonia gandhi congress kaaryakari adhyaksh hai or unke kareebi ahamed patel ke hooda se achche sambandh he
 Not only this, Ghulam Nabi Azad, the incharge of Haryana, constantly kept explaining to the high command that no coin other than Bhupendra Singh Hooda would be able to run in front of the BJP
 hooda ne 18 agast ko rohtak main party par dabaav banane ke liye apni parivartan raily kii
 He also gave an ultimatum to the party in gestures
 aise main congress ke varisht netaaon ne hooda ko samajhaayaa ki hooda party par apana vishwaas jataaai or ultimatum se peeche haten
 On Tuesday, the committee formed by him authorized him for Khanapurti to take a decision again
 Just a day later on Wednesday, Ghulam Nabi Azad reached the Congress office and declared Shailja Kumari as Haryana Congress state president without naming Ashok Tanwar
 
 bhupendra singh hooda kii pehali shart hi ashok tanvar ko hataakar kisi or netaa ko adhyaksh banane kii maang kii thi
 At the same time, Randeep Surjewala was constantly backing Ashok Tanwar
 aakhirkaar chali bhupendra hooda kii, unhone shailaja kumari ke naam par sahmati bhari thi
 Her Dalit women's card worked for Shailaja
 ahamed patel or aaazaad ke samarthan ke chalate unka palada baari pad gaya
 All three of his demands for Bhupendra Hooda were accepted
 hooda ko do pad mili
 He has been declared the chairman of the Haryana Election Committee and he will also be the leader of the CLP i
e
 the CM candidate will also be the same according to the important role and background in ticket distribution
 saath hi yah pehla bada badlaav he, jisamen sonia kii chhap najar ai he or aise main kayaasabaaji tej he ki baaki bhi rahul ke numaayindon par gaaj giregi yaa haryana kaa badlaav ek majaburi thi or aage sonia gandhi santulan banaakar chalengi
 Today the hartala is Teej
 suhaaginen apane suhaag kii lambii aayu ke liye ye vrath karti hai
 This fast is a fast with very strict rules
 zyaadaatar striyaan is vrath ko nirjal hi rakhti hai
 On this day, the Suhagins seek the boon of the immortal Suhag by pleasing Lord Shiva with rigorous penance and worship
 darasal, maa parvati ne bhi kathor tapasya karne ke baad pati ke rup main mahadev ko praapt kiya tha
 Hence, Mother Parvati and Mahadev are worshiped together on Teej
 lekin kya aapako pataa he ki haritalika teej ke din bhagwaan shiv or maa parvati ko kya arpit karne se nishchit taur papkhand saubhaahgya kaa vardanmiltaa he
 If not, we are telling you here
 jyotishacharya shailendra pandeya ke mutabik alag raashi kii striyon ko teej ke din alag-alag chadhaava chadhaane kaa mahatv he
 This will give them the desired blessing
 jaaniye raashi ke anusaar shiv-parvati par kya chadhaane se miltaa he akhand saubhaahgya kaa vardaan

 Tuesday night around 8 in Salarpur village of Noida adjacent to Delhi
 30 baje ek yuvak kii tabadatod goliyon se bhun kar hatya kar di gai
 The reason behind the murder is said to be mutual rivalry
 vaardaat kii soochna milte hi mauk par baari police bal tainaat kar diya gaya he
 The police has started investigating the case by sending the dead body for postmortem
 jaankaree ke mutabik, noida ke salarpur gaanv main rahane vaala saajan bhaati peshey se gym trainer tha
 On Tuesday night, as soon as Saajan came near the house sitting in his car at around 8:30 pm, the miscreants who had been ambushed in the car started firing swiftly at Saajan
 saajan ko kai goliyaan lagi
 Hearing the sound of gunfire, his father came out
 itane main hi safed rang kii swift car main aae badmaash faraar ho gaye
 The father of the deceased brother-in-law says that his brother's boys have carried out this incident
 iske peeche ilaake main chalane vaale auto or gadiyon se hafte ko lekar jhagada or puraani ranjish he
 The seriously injured Sajan was rushed to the hospital in a hurry, where he died
 poliskaa kahana he ki mritak ke shav ko kabje main lekar postmortem ke liye aspataal bheja gaya he
 The miscreants also fired on the car of the deceased brother-in-law
 use bhi kabje main lekar thane main laayaa gaya he
 Forensic evidence has been found from the murders
 mritak ke parijanon kii taharir par aropiyon ke khilaaf namjad cese darj karke is maamle kii jaanch shuru kar di gai he
 a farmer committed suicide in Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh
 meghasivani gaanv ke rahane vaale akadu uike kaa shav unke khet ke kareeb phoos ke chajje se latakta hua mila
 Chhindwara is the constituency of Chief Minister Kamal Nath of the state
 mritak ke parijanon ke mutabik chaar saal se khet main fasal kharaab ho rahi thi
 The debt of 9000 rupees was heavy for the daughter's marriage, then 55-year-old Akdu Uike embraced the hanging noose
 mritak kii patni sakalvati ne bataaya 've mazdooree karte the kyonki chaar saal se khet main kuch nahin pakaa
 There is a loan of 9000 rupees in the daughter's wedding
 maine kaha ladkaa he de degaa
 ' vaise police kii theory alag he use lagata he sharaab pikar akadu ne faansee laga lee
 Chhindwara SP Manoj Rai said, 'when we spoke to the family, it was found that the deceased was addicted to alcohol and was heavily intoxicated
 usko lekar sambhavat: yah aatmahatya pratham drushtya prathit ho rahi he
 We have not received any suicide note
 ham aage kii karrwai kar rahe hai
 ' congress ko lagata he ki is aatmahatya main bijepi kii bhoomika kii jaanch chahie, to bijepi ko lagata he ki prashasan kaa bartaav congress pravaktaa kii tarah he
 Congress spokesperson Ravi Saxena said, "we are seeing that ever since we have waived the loan of the farmer, BJP has been badly stung
" tab se koi ghatana nahin hui he
 Just two days ago, former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan is saying that the debt of farmers has not been forgiven
 lagaataar is tarah kaa jhootha prachaar kar rahe hai
 We have also complained about this in the Election Commission today
 mujhe lagata he is angel par bhi dekhnaa hoga
 ' vahiin purv sahakaarita mantri or bijepi vidhayak vishwaas saarang kaa kahana tha ki 'kisaan se karje kaa jhootha vaada aapane kiya, aapse kisaan pareshaan he
 The farmer sees an atmosphere of complete chaos in his farming
 yadi kisaan aatmahatya karata he to aansu ponchney ke bajaae prashasan, espi aakar congress ke pravaktaa ke rup main baat kar rahe hai
 He is the SP of the district or the spokesperson of the Congress
 congress kah rahi he isamen bhi bijepi kaa haath hoga
 This is a great example of the failure of the Kamal Nath government of Madhya Pradesh only
 'kamalnath sarkaar ne satta sambhalate hi do lakh rupee tak kii karjamaafee kar di
 Out of a total of 55,61,713 farmers, 51,22,567 farmers filled loan waiver forms
 loksabhaa chunaav kaa elaan hone se pehle sarkaar ne nau march tak 25 lakh kisaanon kaa karja maaf kiya he jis par saat hajaar do sau karod rupee kaa kharchaa aayaa he
 The police which would curb drug traffickers in Punjab, now the government will investigate how many of the police have been enslaved
 police hi nahin punjab ke sarkari karmchaariyon kii jaanch hogi ki ve nasha lete hai yaa nahin
 The government also has to fight the government
 filmon se lekar media main chhapi khabaron ko yaad kiijie
 With the help of the system, the smugglers first ruined the society, now the smugglers have engulfed the system
 kya yah kisi bhi sarkaar ke liye saamaanya faisla rahaa hoga ki apane paanch lakh karmchaariyon kii jaanch karenge
 The Punjab government has been continuously taking decisions one after the other, but stop by this decision and see that when the government suspects the government, then the intoxication must have created a furore in the society
 pichley kuch dinon police se sambandhit jo khabaren aa rahi hai wo acchhee nahin he
 On 1 July, while selling drugs to Rampura Phool, the Congress leader's son was caught and handed over to the police
 esechao or munshi ne pachaas hazaar lekar aaropee ko chhod diya
 But when people saw him walking in the locality, he got angry and started protesting
 sarkaar ne turant jaanch kii or esechao or munshi ko giraftaar kar liya
 DSP Daljit Singh was suspended in Firozpur, alleging that he had intoxicated a woman
 jalanghar main tainaat inspector injit singh ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 It was alleged that these drugs were puppets at the hands of the mafia
 gurudaspur main esechao rajendra kumaar or sipaahi jatinder singh barkhaast kar die gaye
 No government will say that it will conduct a dope test of three lakh employees, it is not an ordinary incident, it is an alarm that the state of intoxication in Punjab is far above the danger mark
 khilaadiyon kaa dope test hota he duniya bhar main unke dope test ke teen darjan hi centre hai magar yahaan paanch lakh logon ke dope test kii baat ho rahi he
 There will be dope test when government employees are appointed and dope test when promoted
 2016 main akali-bhaajapa sarkaar ne bhi bahaali ke samay 7200 sipaahiyon kaa dope test karaayaa tha
 Turn the Punjab newspapers, there will be plenty of news related to the drug
 jane un pariwaron par kya bitati hogi jinka sadsy nashe kii chapet main aa gaya he or maaraa ja rahaa he
 Some sample newspapers of July 5 want to present for you

 There has been a news in Dainik Bhaskar that 2 people died in Tarn Taran due to intoxication
 33 dinon main 46 logon kii maut hui he
 Due to these reports, the Punjab government is in action, but the society cannot find a way how to save Punjab from drug addiction
 abhi tak nashe ke network kii qamar nahin todi ja saki he
 The Health Minister does not believe that all the deaths have been caused by drugs, but the government is also investigating
 nashe par nazar rakhane vaale patrkaar bataate hai ki drugs na milane or milane ke kaaran mautein ho rahi hai
 If not found, try the combination of new medical medicines, due to which overdose is leading to death
 zyaadaatar mautein punjab ke maanjha ilaake main hui hai
 Another of our colleague SB Sharma told that 25 year old Babu was found dead in the fields in Bathinda
 uske paas se injection or syrinj mili he
 Babloo, who works in a horse farm, got intoxicated
 ek beti he or patni bhi hai
 The father says that he died due to an overdose

 fakir mohan senapati kaa janm odisha ke baleshwar jile ke mallikaspur gaanv main 13 janvari 1843 main hua
 In the stories and novels of this 'katha-samrat' of Oriya literature, the extremely insignificant, low-lying character of the then society, Saria, Bhagiya appears
 unki likhi kahaniyon main ‘revati’, 'patant medicine’, ‘dakmunshi’, ‘sabhy jamidaar’ pramukh hai
 Premchand in Hindi literature and Fakir Mohan in Oriya literature are considered equivalent
 donon lekhakon kii kahaniyon main tatkaaleen samaaj main anubhoot bharat kii saamaajik, raajnneetik, arthnithik or saanskrithik avasthaaon kaa samyak roopayan kiya gaya he
 He has also translated the texts of Ramayana, Gita, Upanishads etc
 into Oriya language
 fakir mohan kii mashhoor kahani 'dakmunshi' ek angreji padhe yuvak gopal kii kahani he, jo apane buudhe gramin pita hari singh ko beghar kar detaa he
 This story which hurts the society and its system is still widely appreciated today
 14 june 1918 ko is mahaan sahityakar kaa nidhan ho gaya
 Dinesh Kumar Mali's translation of Fakir Mohan Senapati's story 'dakmunshi' into Hindi - Hari Singh had shifted to many small and big towns till now in government work
 ab vah das saal se katak head post-offis main kaam kar rahe hai
 Due to good working style, he continued to get promotions
 ab vah head chaparasi hai
 Monthly salary nine rupees
 katak shahar main sab kuch khareednaa padataa he
 Matchboxes had to be purchased to light a fire
 pet katkar jitna bhi bachaao, magar paanch rupee se kam kharch nahin aata tha
 In any case, not sending at least four rupees in the house did not work
 ghar main patni or aath saal kaa betaa tha gopal
 There was a place for a small village
 isliye chaar rupee main jaise-taise kaam chal jaataa tha
 If one penny was lost by four rupees, it would have been difficult
 gopal madhyamik vidhyalay main pard rahaa tha
 The school fees were to come twice a month
 skool fees ke alaava kitaaben kharidne ke liye kuch zyada paise lag jate the
 When some additional expenses were incurred, the month would pass
 kabhi- kabhaar buudhe ko bhookha tak rahanaa padataa tha
 It does not matter if he is hungry, but his son was studying
 ek din post master sarvice book kholkar batalaane lage, 'hari singh, tum pachpan saal ke ho gaye ho
 Now you will get pension
 ab tum naukari main nahin rah sakoge
 'there was a thunderclap on Singh's head
 kya karegaa? ghar sansar kaise chalegaa? ghar kii baat chodo, gopal kii padhai thapp ho jaaegi
 Ever since Gopal was born, Hari Singh has kept a dream in mind - Gopal will be the post-master in the post office of the town - at least the village will have a post-master
 parantu thodi si angreji nahin aane se naukari milanaa mushkil he
 There is no English reading system in the town
 isliye katak bhejkar use padhai karwaanaa uchit hoga
 If the job is finished then his dream will be shattered
 yahi baat soch-sochakar uskaa sharir shushk lakdi kii tarah ho gaya tha
 Sleep had disappeared from the eyes at night
 hari singh ke upar post-master kii meharbaani thi
 Despite being a servant in his house, Hari Singh used to go to the post-master's house and do some work in the evening
 shaam ko aaraam kursi main baithkar post-master angreji samachar padhate samay tambaakoo kii chilam banaata tha
 No one could do as he prepared Chillam
 ek din hari singh ne chilam taiyaar kar ke babu ke saamne rakhi
 Babu's mouth used to smoke like an engine, and the eyelids of his eyes would get drunk
 tab hari singh ko laga, yah uchit samay he
 Hari Singh while prostrating the post-mastrji, folded his hands and put his grief and pain in front of him with humble gesture
 gopal ke liye usne jo sapana buna tha, use bhi bataanaa nahin bhuulaa
 Post- Master Babu was in a state of health
 ve gambhir mudra main bole, 'thik he, ek aavedan-patr bharkar de dena
 'babuji could have done this work with ease because the Postal Inspector or Superintendent used to stay in his bungalow when he visited
 vah ucch adhikariyon ke liye khaane- pine kii samuchit vyavastha bhi karte the
 That night, post-master Babu was repeatedly calling him 'hari Singh, Hari Singh'
 hari singh bahut anbhavi aadmi tha
 He had seen great Sahibs for many years
 vah acchhee tarah se unke mizaaj ke bare main jaanata tha
 He also knew well which Sahibs are happy in what ways
 us din aadhi raat tak hari singh ko post-master babu ke bangale main ruknaa padaa kyonki oreisha ke pradooshit vaataavaran ke kaaran kahin babu biimaar pad ulti karne naa lag jaae
 At the time of vomiting Hari Singh had to manage Babuji along with arranging soda, lemon etc
 babuji ke aaraam se sone ke baad hari singh aadhiraat ko apane ghar lautakar khaanaa banane laga tha
 Thus Hari Singh was familiar with the big princes above him
 hari singh ke aavedan-patr main babuji ne apni taraf se acchhee tarah sifarish likhakar shahar bhej di thi
 The extension order arrived a few days later
 hari singh bahut khush ho gaya
 He also sent this good news to his village
 log turant mili sukh-dukh main kho jate hai, magar bhavishya main vidhaataa ne jo unke liye tay kiya he us taraf unki nazren nahin jaati hai
 This happiness of Hari Singh ended like a bubble of water
 uske ghar se ek patr aayaa ki gopal kii maa ko sannipat kii beemaari ho gai he or uske jeene kii aashaa nahin ke baraabar he
 Hari Singh showed the letter to the post-master Babu
 babu bade hi dayaalu swabhaav ke the, turant hi uski ghar jane kii chuttee manjuur kar di
 In one stroke, Hari Singh went to his house
 ghar pahunch kar usne jo dekha, use dekhakar uski ankhon kii chamak chali gai
 As if this world disappeared into darkness
 uski patni maranasann thi
 Seeing the husband with misty eyes, he bowed with both hands raised and expressed a desire to take Charan Raja
 sirf charan-raj lene ke liye uski saanse ataki hui thi? uske baad sab shant
 Hari Singh's world was destroyed apane ghar kaa bachaa khuchaa saamaan bechakar vah bete ke saath katak laut aayaa
 Gopal studied in Minor School (class seven)
 hari singh kii mushkil se guzar basar ho rahi thi, kyonki vah pensionbhogi ho gaya tha
 Sometimes Lota, and sometimes sold bronze utensils and walked home somehow
 jab naukari thi tab maheene main do-chaar aane rakhkar bachat khate main rakhaa karata tha
 All was spent in studying at Gopal's Minor School
 hari singh sochaa karata tha ki gopal ke miner paas karne ke baad sab ksht dur ho jaaenge
 Gopal had also assured many times on this, 'father, teach me by taking a good loan and i will repay all the debts after getting a job
 'hari singh kii prarthana deenabandhu deenanath ne sun lee
 There was no limit to the happiness of Hari Singh
 vahiin puraane post-master babu abhi bhi naukari main the
 Hari Singh pleaded with his hands and feet very much
 hari singh ke upar bhi bade logon kii krupa-drushti thi
 Gopal was immediately appointed to the post of sub-master at the Bhakrampur Post Office
 maheene main bees rupee tankhwaah thi
 Hari Singh was not happy
 philhal sadar post offis se chaar maheene prashikshan lekar vah apane kasbe main laut jayega
 Hari Singh was repeatedly bowing before the Lord, 'blessed Lord, by your mercy the sufferings of a poor man like me have been relieved
 'aage padhein, kaise badal gaya hari singh kaa jivan
 
 
 
 naukari lagane kii khabar jis din buudhe ko mili thi us raat akele main baithkar khub royaa tha, 'hai! aaj agar budhi jinda hoti to kitna khush hoti
 His Gopal has got the job of Bade Sahib
 ghar main utsav sa maahaul ho jaataa
 Oh! These days were not to be seen in the fate of the unfortunate
 dekhte-dekhte gopal bada sahib ban gaya
 God protect him
 'gopal ne pehle maheene kii tankhwaah laakar buudhe ke haath main de di
 Old man very happy uske pair jameen par nahin padate the
 The son has become a big sahib, has earned a lot of money together
 rupayon ko chaar-paanch baar ginakar apane anti main baandhakar rakhaa
 The next day he rushed towards the market in a hurry
 juute, kurta, dhoti jin-jin saamaanon kii jarurat thi, sab kharidkar laayaa tha
 Gopal has become Bada Sahib, now will he wear the same old clothes there? Seeing the frontal, apply tilak
 usee tarah nae kapadon kii jarurat thi
 Here Gopal Babu used to sit in the office and write English like five men
 babuon ke saath uskaa uthanaa-baithna hone laga
 Everyone called him by the name of Dakmunshi Babu
 puraa naam tha gopal chandra singh
 Here Gopal used to return home and see that the old man is working in a filthy dhoti
 - gopal kis tarah acha khaanaa khayega?- vah nahaaya yaa nahin?- geele kapade sookhe hai yaa nahin?- bechaare ke paas kaam kii kami nahin he
 He used to have all these worries throughout the day
 pehle hari singh kabhi-kabhaar harinaam liya karata tha
 Used to do some charity
 ab gopal ke liye sab bhul chukaa tha
 Perhaps God got angry at the old man after seeing all this
 maano kah rahe the are! buddhiheen, ye sab kya kar rahe ho? ek din tumhen sab pataa chal jayega
 Now there was some change in the gesture of Gopal Babu
 ab pitaaji ko dekhne se bina kisi kaaran se vah chidhane laga tha
 'this is stupid
 ise angreji maaloom nahin he
 i will address this man wearing unhygienic clothes and call him Dad
 log kya sochenge?' us din goun pahane hue kuch padhi-likhi aurate khadi thi
 There was no shirt on the body of the old man
 chhi:! chhi:! sharam nahin ai usko
 If it is not taken out of the house, then my respect will be ruined
 ek din dakmunshi babu pitaaji ko kehane laga, 'dekho, tumne mere liye kuch bhi nahin kiya he
 Nobody was kind enough to teach me
 man he to yahaan raho, nahin to yahaan se chale jaao
 But remember, if you want to stay here then don't come out from inside the house when Babu comes
 'gopal kii baat sunakar buudhe kaa dil dahal gaya
 He sat down with utter disguise
 apane bete kii baat vah kisase karata? uske dil main us jagah ghaav ho gaya, jise vah kisi ko dikhaa bhi nahin saktaa tha
 In front of which he could speak his mind, she had passed away from this world
 use budhi kii yaad aane lagi
 That heart started crying a lot
 rote-rote usne chaaron taraf drushti daali magar koi bhi bharose vaala aadmi nahin mila
 The old man used to remember the old man very much in happiness and sorrow
 buudhe ne ronaa band kiya kyonki uske rone se gopal kaa anisht hoga
 Gopal was going towards the town for some work the next morning
 magar usne yaa baat buudhe ko nahin bataai
 Woke up in the morning and started saying in a stopped voice, 'O Baba! i am going to village
 tum ye sara saamaan lekar aao
 Not much stuff
 kuli kyon karuunga? kuli ko dene ke liye mere paas paise nahin hai
 'gopal Babu got dressed and put an umbrella in his side and started walking with sticks
 ab boodha kya karegaa? sara saamaan ikattha karke potli baandhakar sir par rakhkar chal padaa
 He could not even walk properly
 uske sharir main ab vah takat nahin bachi thi
 Tears started dripping from his eyes
 jaise-taise das jagah uthte-baithte hue shaam tak vah makrampur main pahunchaa
 Babu rebukes him for being late
 boodha gumsum hokar baith gaya
 Gopal Babu started coming to the office in the morning and evening
 boodha ghar main baithkar ghar gruhasthi kaa kaam dekhtaa tha
 Father and son never used to sit and talk about happiness and sorrow, Dakmunshi i
e
 the great sire of the town
 kitne log aakar namaste karte the
 What does an old fool know? Who will interact with him
 kasbe kaa jalwaayu buudhe ke liye anukool nahin tha
 Fever started happening
 khon-khon karke khansane laga
 There was too much cough at night
 gopal babu ke sone ke liye pareshaani hone lagi
 He called his peon and ordered, 'go, take it to the old man and throw it somewhere in the bushes
 'vah chaparasi murkh tha
 He did not know English
 phir bhi vah deshi hriday vaala tha
 He started thinking - would it be appropriate to take this old man and leave him in the bushes? Trembling with fever
 teen din se pet main ek bhi dana nahin gaya
 It is not okay to leave it out in the dark at midnight
 thand kii vajah se buudhe kii khaansee or zyada bad gai
 Gopal Babu's anger is not limited, he put two English punches in the old man's chest
 or bistar-bichhaune ko uthaakar baahar phenk diya
 The old man returned to his village
 aas-paas ke logon ke munh se yah baat sunne ko mil rahi thi
 Gopal Babu's heart is very happy since that day and the old man also returned to his village and gave two bighas of land for wages
 ghar main baithe-baithe anaaj mil jaataa tha, pension ke paison se kapadaa-latta or ghar ke parchuni saamaanon kaa kharch nikal jaataa tha
 Ever since coughing he became addicted to eating opium
 magar uskaa sara kharch aaraam se nikal jaataa tha
 He used to take the name of God while sitting in the verandah
 ab baap-betaa dono khush the
 The reader will be happy to see the happiness of others

 The entire country is angry over the rape and murder of an innocent girl in Kathua
 dharti kii jananath se lekar dilli ke jantar-mantar tak log peedit parivaar ko nyaay or doshiyon ko sajaa dilaane kii maang kar rahe hai
 But now such efforts are also being started which are not only questioning the major faces behind this movement but also showing the motive of this movement has gone astray
 inhen koshishon ke tahat kathua cese ko lekar ek audio viral hua he
 Through this audio of 3 minutes 52 seconds, it is being claimed that 70 lakh rupees were raised in the name of justice to the family of the Kathua rape victim, but they did not reach the victim's family
 tepe main peedita ke vakil talib hossain, deepika singh rajaavat or jeenyu kii chaatraneta shehla rashid par peedit parivaar ke liye jutaaye gaye paison ke gaban kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he
 What is the conversation in the audio? The audio records the conversation on 15 April between Chaudhary Najakat Khatana, a resident of Jammu and chairman of the All India Tribe Coordination Committee, and Waqar Bhatti, who runs an organization called 'majloom Ki Awaaz'
 audio main najaakat kehete hai ki talib peedit parivaar ke naam par dilli se 60-70 lakh rupee lekar aayaa tha or wo shehla rashid ke saath milakar peedit parivaar ko bhunaa rahaa he jabaki peedita ko nyaay dilaane kii asli ladaai wo log lard rahe hai
 Waqar also says that he made the girl's photo viral, shut down Jammu and got out a candle march, but Talib, Deepika and Shehla are taking advantage
 vakaar najaakat se kehete hai ki ladki ke parivaar ko sachai bataao or apane paale main karo
 If the girl's family comes to us, we will put lakhs of rupees in her account within ten days
 vakaar daawa karte hai ki usne logon se chanda lekar ek vyakti ke acount main 25 lakh rupaya dalwaaya tha or wo paanch minute video par bolenge ki is fimali kii madad karo to lakhon rupee aa jaaenge
 In the conversation, Waqar also says that on 24 April, actor Ejaz Khan is coming from Mumbai to meet the family and he will directly help the family with them
 kisne record kiya ye audio tepe?audio ke bare main aajtak
 When asked Waqar Bhatti, he said that only a few people associated with Talib have told him that Talib is raising money in the name of the girl, but he is not getting anything
 wo peedita ke liye lard to rahe hai lekin sari vaahvahee deepika, shehla or talib ko mil rahi he
 i have no proof, but it must be asked from Talib that where is he coming from Delhi to Jammu again and again, where is his expenditure coming from? ”waqar Bhatti admitted that he recorded this conversation She and herself had sent this recording to a friend
 udhar nazaakat khataana ne vakaar kii is baat ko sire se khaarij kar diya ki unhone vakaar ko phone karke aisa kuch bataaya tha
 On the contrary, he accused Waqar of using himself
 talib par lagaae gaye aaropon par unka kahana tha, 'talib or ham saath-saath the
 But he does not pick up my phone for the last few days
 mujhe kahin nahin bulaata
 Doesn't ask me anything main keval itnaa chahta hum ki wo mujhe bataae ki wo kya kar rahaa he? dilli main ja rahaa he to kya kar rahaa he? rahi paison ke ghapale kii baat to mujhe mere ladakon ne bataaya ki usne itane paise jutaaye hai isliye maine aisa kaha
 We are fighting for justice for the girl child on the ground, but no one is asking us
 sab talib, shehla or deepika kii baat kar rahe hai jabaki shehla dilli kii hai
 Talib and Deepika are only lawyers while i have buried the baby girl with these hands
 ’aaropon par kya he shehla or talib kii safai?aajtak
 in also sought Shehla's favor on the allegations
 bakaul shehla ‘in aaropon main koi sachai nahin he
 No one has any cache
 naa to mere paas, naa hi talib ke paas or naa hi deepika ke paas
 Why these people are saying this would be known to them, but the truth is that we have a crowd funding website www
 crowdnewsing
 The fund was collected through com
 shuru main hamane yah tay kiya tha ki koi chaar-paanch lakh rupee ikatthe honge jisase kanoonee ladaai ladi jaaegi lekin jab deepika ne kah diya ki wo is maamle main ek paisa nahin lengi to hamane tay kiya ki jo bhi paisa aayega use unnav or kathua ke peedit pariwaron main baraabar-baraabar baant diya jayega
 She further adds, "I have come to know through the Talib and Deepika families of the Kathua case that the victim families are opening their accounts and the victim family of the Unnao case has applied for a PAN card
" hamane kisi ke acount main koi paisa nahin mangavaya
 So far, nearly 45 lakh rupees have been collected and all the money www

 agar kisi ko is bare main koi shaq ho to wo vahaan se puri jaankaree le sakate hai
 The second charge against Shehla is that she lives in Delhi and is much later involved in the Kathua case
 is bare main shehla kahati hai, 'bahut ajeeb he ye sab bataanaa phir bhi main bataati hum
 i first tweeted in February about this matter
 is twit main maine jammu-kashmir kii mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ko tag karke safai maangi thi jiske baad se lagaataar is maamle se judi hui hum
 i took up this matter wherever i got the chance
 yahaan tak ki maine india today conklev ke manch se bhi is mudde ko uthaaya tha
 People who are talking like this now used to call me initially and thank them for joining the case
 ab pataa nahin ye log aisa kyon bol rahe hai?’apane upar lag rahe aaropon ke bare main talib hossain ne kaha ki ye donon log us shadyantr kaa hissaa ban gaye hai jiske tahat bacchee ke nyaay ke maamle ko talib, deepika or shehla kii taraf shift karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Knowingly or unknowingly, these people have fallen victim to a big conspiracy
 agar kisi ko lagata he ki maine yaa kisi or ne koi gaban kiya he to ek alag jaanch karvaa lijie or agar us jaanch main ek rupee kii gadabadi kii baat bhi sabit ho jaaegi to main koi bhi sajaa bhugatne ke liye taiyaar hum
 According to Ashwini Kumar, the bureaucrat of Aaj Tak in Jammu, it is difficult to say who is telling the truth and who is lying but talib is educated
 usne is maamle ko shuru se uthaaya he
 He took the same with us
 ab kuch log usapar aarope laga rahe hai

 This is why apple vinegar has been used for centuries
 seb ke sirke main calories kii maatra behad kam hoti he
 In addition, it contains plenty of antioxidants, amino acids and potassium

 Several study reports claimed that the consumption of apple vinegar reduced weight as well as reduced abdominal fat
 aaie jaanate hai vajan kam karne main seb kaa sirka kitna ahm he
 1
 100 gram seb ke sirke main lagbhag 22 calories hoti hai
 In the morning on an empty stomach, drinking one teaspoon of apple vinegar in a glass of water, drinking it strengthens metabolicism and reduces belly fat
 2
 The acetic acid present in apple vinegar plays the most important role in reducing abdominal fat
 rojaan seb ke sirke kaa seven karne se vajan jaldi kam hota he
 3
 clinical jarnal main prakashit study ke matabik, seb ke sirke main maujuud asetic acid padaarth ke kaaran iskaa seven karne ke baad lambey samay tak pet bharaa rahata he
 This does not make you craving to eat more, which helps in losing weight
 4
 Several studies have reported that the consumption of apple vinegar keeps blood sugar under control
 vahiin, healdi tareeke se vajan kam karne ke liye blad sugar kaa niyantran main rahanaa bahut jaruri hota he
 This is the right way to consume apple vinegar - Never take apple vinegar alone, but mix it in water and consume it in the right quantity
 - ek baar ke bajaae thodi-thodi der baad seb ke sirke kaa seven karnaa zyada phydemand hota he
 Try to eat vinegar before eating
 - sirke ke adhik seven se gale main dikkat ho sakati he, isliye adhik maatra main iskaa seven karne se bachein
 To lose weight, consult your doctor once before consuming vinegar daily

 After the election results in Maharashtra, BJP can place a condition in front of Shiv Sena
 sutron ke mutabik khabar aa rahi he ki uddhav thakare ko piem ko chywala kehane ke bayaan par maafee maangane ke liye kaha ja saktaa he
 If they do not do so, then Shiv Sena minister Anant Geete can be asked to withdraw
 philhal 19 oktober ko maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey ghoshit hone kaa intjaar he
 If a common man can become a PM, then why not i CM: Uddhav Thackeray is aware that the 25-year-old alliance between Shiv Sena and BJP has broken down for the Maharashtra Assembly elections
 iske baad se hi donon partiyon ke rishte main talkhi aa gai
 There was a lot of political rhetoric during the election campaign
 haalanki, pradhanmantri modi ne ek raily main kaha tha ki vah shivasena ko lekar kuch nahin bolenge kyonki vah bal thakare kaa sammaan karte hai
 But Uddhav Thackeray repeatedly accused BJP and Narendra Modi of cheating
 unki taraf se morcha shivasena ke mukhpatr 'saamana' ne bhi sambhala
 Ever since the alliance broke up, Saamna has described BJP as the enemy of the patriarchs and sometimes the enemy of Maharashtra
 bayaanbaji ke bich shivasena ke mantri anant geete ke modi sarkaar main bane rahane par yathasthiti barkaraar rahi
 However, in the afternoon just a day before the election, a Shiv Sena article created a political uproar
 is lekh main bakaul uddhav thakare likhaa gaya, 'jab ek chywala desh kaa pradhanmantri ban saktaa he to main maharashtra kaa siem kyon nahin?' ise lekar siyaasi bakheda ho gaya
 After this, Saamana used the common man by removing the word chaiwala, but it was too late
 bijepi ko shivasena kii yah bayaanbaji nagavar gujri
 Union Minister Nitin Gadkari bluntly said that the party would not bear the insult of PM
 is lekh ke kaaran ab donon partiyon ke rishte main or khatas aa gai he
 BJP has not said much on the statement of bjp's revenge due to exit poll, BJP suddenly adopted a tough attitude
 iske peeche agsit pole ke anumaan bhi ahm vajah hai
 Before the election, the party was in a dilemma as to how many seats it would win
 kahin phir se shivasena ke saath gathjod to nahin karnaa padegaa
 But now that most of the polls are showing BJP near the majority figure, in such a situation the party has told its stand to Shiv Sena
 ab dekhnaa yah hoga ki bijepi kii is shart par shivasena kya kahati he
 The Shaheen Bagh area of delhi usually has round-the-clock movement
 lekin isi ilaake main bekhauf badmaashon kii dehshat bhi kaayam he
 Where some miscreants attacked a house and tried to carry out the robbery
 lekin tabhi makaan maalik ke aa jane sebadmaashon kaa planteel ho gaya or ve makaan maalik ko ghayal kar maukey se faraar ho gaye

 ravivaar ko jiyaul apni patni or do betiyon ke saath bazaar gaye the
 Jiaul returned at around 8 pm
 jiyaul kii patni 2 betiyon ke saath upar gai to unhen apane makaan kaa darwaja khulaa mila
 She got scared when a boy inside tried to drag her inside
 is vajah se choti bacchee ghabara gai or cheekh padi
 Jiyul was terrified to hear the sound of her baby's scream, when a boy running from above pushed them away
 uske peeche doosraa ladkaa aayaa, jisane haath me tamancha le rakhaa tha
 When Jiaul tried to stop him, he made one of three blows to Jiaul's head from the butt
 jisase jiyaul behosh ho gaye or donon lutere vahaan se bhaag nikle
 According to Ziaul Haq, these two were thieves and seeing the house locked, broke the lock of the house and entered inside
 jab tak wo almaari kaa taala tod pate, iske pehle jiyaul waapas aa gaye or badmaashon ko bhaagna padaa
 Police has registered an FIR in this case
 lekin abhi tak choron kaa koisurag nahinlaga he

 Also, the survey from NDMC was also stopped
 nai arji main NDMC ne court se survey ko puraa karne kii ijaajat maangi he
 Because NDMC argues that 90% survey has been done
 NDMC ne kaha ki is maamle main lau and order thik karne ke liye yah survey karnaa bahut jaruri he
 If the survey is completed, if any vendor is found to be doing something wrong in the market then it will be easy to catch it
 NDMC ne court ko bataaya ki kai baar survey ko karne ke dauraan adhikariyon par vahaan ke mafia ne atake bhi kiya he
 Whose FIR has also been registered
 hai court ke ste ke baad rehadi patari maffia is aadesh kaa galat faaydaa uthaa rahe hai
 NDMC said that we have formed the first Town Vending Committee in Delhi
 iskaa kaam hi ye pataa karnaa he ki koun asli rehadi patari vaale hai or koun avaidh kabza karke baithe hue he
 The survey was started from July 25 and 90% has been completed
 NDMC kaa court main tark tha ki bazaaron main avaidh nirmaan ke chalate trephic jam hota he
 Many constructions have been done in a shop
 jise rokna behad jaruri he
 Therefore, the High Court should order to complete the survey
 vahiin kai market association kaa tark tha ki no vendor jone main vendor ko jane kii ijaajat nahin honi chahie
 But there should be a complete arrangement for them to sit in the vending zone
 hai court ne kaha ki hamen pataa he ki hamane jo ste lagaaya he wo isko lekar he ki jo jahaan par he filhal use vahi (rehadi patari vaale)rahane diya jaae
 Do not remove them from the police or MCD there
 9 sitambar ko dilli hai court ne kisi bhi rehadi patari vaale ko dilli main hataane ko lekar roak laga di thi
 The High Court had given notice to the Delhi government, the police, all the mcds and lgs and sought their response
 yachika congress ke netaa ajay maakan ne lagaayi he
 After this order of the High Court, the police and MCD are not able to remove the street vendors of Delhi at present
 hai court ne aadesh diya he ki jab tak dilli main unki ginati se judaa hua survey puraa nahin ho jaataa or saath hi sarkaar koi thos policy rehadi patari waalon ke liye nahin bana leti, jo vendor jahaan he use vahaan se na hataaya jaae

 Addressing two big rallies in Columbus, Ohio and Richmond, Virginia, Obama said his agenda was a change
 
 
 is disha main kaaphi kaam hua, lekin abhi mukaam tak nahin pahunch paaya, isliye unhen ek or mauka diya jaae
 Attacking his Republican rival Mitt Romney, Obama said that Americans cannot afford to give him a chance, because his agenda is about steroids
 america raashtrapati ne kaha, abhi nahin
 No when so much is at stake
 yah mahaj ek or chunaav nahin he
 This is the moment of becoming or deteriorating for the American middle class
 ham badlaav kii disha main itane aage aa gaye hai ki peeche nahin mud sakate
 We have struggled for the last few years
 chunavi abhiyaan ke dauraan donon reliyon main obama ke saath unki patni mishael bhi shaamil thim
 Obama said, we have moved forward
 
 
 jaise bhavishya ke bare main hamane 2008 main sochaa tha
 We have to move towards a future where everyone gets equal opportunity, everyone gets equal share and everyone comes under the same rule
 unhone kaha, yahi is chunaav main vikalp he or yahi kaaran he ki main america ke raashtrapati pad ke duusare kaarykaal ke liye maidan main hum
 In these rallies, Obama was getting a lot of support from the audience and he was raising slogans of 'four more years'

 You are working harder than ever
 jis chunauti kaa ham abhi saamana kar rahe hai or ek dashak se adhik samay se karte rahe hai ki yah kathin parishram, adhik aay main nahin badal paaya he
 Higher profits have not turned into better jobs
 obama ne kaha, governor romany is disha main prayaas karte nahin dikh rahe hai
 He does not understand that getting more profit in any way may not always be better for the average American people and our economy
 ohio ke columbus or varjeenia ke richmond main do badi reliyon ko sambodhit karte hue obama ne kaha ki unka agenda badlaav he
 
 
 a lot of work was done in this direction, but could not reach the stage yet, so give them another chance
 apane republican pratidwandvi mit romany par karaara prahaar karte hue obama ne kaha ki america unhen mauka dena bardaasht nahin kar sakate, kyonki unka agenda steroid se judaa he
 US President said, not now
 nahin jab itnaa kuch daanv par laga ho
 This is not just another election

 The comments obama ne kaha ki unke prashasan kii ore se uthaae gaye kadamon ke kaaran aaj arthvyavastha patari par lauti he
 He said, the problem facing our economy is not that the American people are not hardworking
 
 
 aap pehle se adhik mehnat kar rahe hai
 The challenge that we are facing now and have been doing for more than a decade, that it has not turned into hard work, high income
 adhik laabh, behatar rojgaar main nahin badal paaya he
