 Attacking Priyanka Gandhi, she said, 'those who did not contest the election are commenting, it hurts me
 main uttar bharat kaa hum or uttar bharat ke pramukh shahar se kai baar chunaav ladakar aayaa hum, isliye main kisi kaa asammaan nahin karuunga, lekin takalif he un netaaon ko jinhen modi ji kii pratishtha pasand nahin he
 The way Modi is working, he feels that his land is running out, so he is doing so by looking for an excuse
 aisi baaten talash rahe hai ki kaise sarkaar ko katghare main liya jaae
 'santosh Gangwar said that our government has opened the Ministry of Skill Development and the children are being trained accordingly, so that they can get jobs
 unhone kaha, 'pichley 15 saalon main hamaare uttar pradesh main jo bhi sarkarein raheen unhone udyog sthapit kiye hi nahin, isliye logon ko itani naukari nahin mili he

 After presenting a cheap sample of hooliganism in the office of a news channel in Mumbai, the Shiv Sena's popularity has now come to the fore
 shivasena pramukh bal thakare ne saamana main lekh likhakar hamale ko jaays tehraaya he, saath hi media par apana gussa utaara he
 It is not the extent of Dadagiri, what else is it that the goons of a party contesting elections as a political party, try to suppress the voice of the people
 news channel par dhaava bolkar utpaadamchaate hanore usee party ke mukhiya hamale ko jaays tehraate hue media ko koste hai
 Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray has written in the face that media is no god
 ibien lokmat ke daphtar main shivasena ke hamale ke baad desh bhar main jo pratikriya hui, uski hataasha is tarah phooti he
 In the confrontation, Bal Thackeray has written that the role of media is no longer that of Ram Shastra but of Damasastra
 kisi party yaa uske netaa ko badnaam karke use kis tarah harwanaa he, ye kaam media kar rahaa he
 The media has also overtaken Hitler
 maharashtra ke matadaataaon main bhram or shaq paidaa karne kaa kaam media ne kiya
 The Shiv Sena argued that the IBN Lokmat made the issue of Bal Thackeray in the case of Sachin
 saamana main bal thakare ne likhaa he kihamane sachin ke bare main kaha kuch or, media ne use kuch or bataa diya
 So do we have to ask the media to speak a word about our Maharashtra or Mumbai? Bal Thackeray's anger, which was stunned by the defeat in elections, is coming out on a lively basis
 unhone saamana main kaha he kimedia ke maalikon main yaa to rajaneta hai yaa fir koi amir
 On the issue of Marathis, the media gets a stomach ache and their nurtured people work to get that pain out
 saamana ke lekh main bal thakare ne media par apni puri kuntha nikaali he ki ve aage likhte hai kimedia chamachaagiri or ji-huzuri main kho gaya he
 As far as the congress-ncp victory in Maharashtra is concerned, it happened by mistake
 akhir main bal thakare ne ye bhi kaha he ki ibien lokmat ke daphtar main shivasainikon ne jo kiya wo hamalaa nahin tha, balki unke gusse kaa ufaan tha
 It seems clear that the Shiv Sena has been badly defeated after the defeat in the assembly elections

 BJP vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi attacked the Congress on Monday, saying that during the 10 years of UPA rule at the Center, the party created an atmosphere of fear and insecurity and kept Muslims away from progress
 haryana main 15 oktober ko hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ke liye prachaar ke aakhri din nakvi ne sadhaura main kaha, ‘rajnatik phaayde ke liye muslimon kaa jo shoshan kar rahe the, unka jo kuch bhi bachaa he vah bhi congress shasit do rajyon main buudhvaar ko chunaav ke baad samaapt ho jayega
 'naqvi said,' There is a big difference in the thinking of the previous Congress-led government and the current Narendra Modi government towards Indian Muslims
 vigat 10 varshon ke dauraan congress ne dar or asuraksha kaa maahaul paidaa kiya or muslimon ko pragati se milon dur rakhaa

 New year, new law, new India! - Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) March 29, 201712: 02 AM Lucknow: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will meet Legislature party today guangjhu asian khelon main bharat ko pehla swarna padak dilaane vaale kyuu khelon ke ‘golden bvaay’ pankaj adwani ko baliwood se prastaav mil rahe hai lekin katrina caff ke is mureed kaa puraa dhyaan apane khel par he or filmon ke liye unke paas samay nahin
 Advani, who was a billiards singles champion at the Asian Games, said, "there have been many offers from Bollywood but i am the only player to represent India in both snooker and billiards internationally so the schedule is very busy
" mere paas duusari chizon ke liye vakt hi nahin he
 At the Asian Games, world champion Advani was under tremendous pressure of expectations and he also saw medals and waving tricolor in the dream
 bangalore ke is khilaadi ne kaha, ‘main har haalat main bharat ke liye pehla swarna jeetna chahta tha
 i also heard myself standing on the podium with a gold medal, waving the tricolor and listening to the tunes of the crowd
 yah sab kuch hakeekat main hua to bahut khushi hui
 Advani, who considered Roger Federer as the perfect champion after winning the tennis masters title, said, "roger Federer is the real champion
" vyaktigat khelon main apekshaayen or jimmedaariyaan bahut hoti he or main roger se prerana letaa hum
 Asked which of the World Championship and Asiad gold is more important, Advani said that it is difficult to win the world title from the perspective of competition
 unhone kaha, ‘vishwa khitaab jeetna bahut mushkil hota he lekin asian khel chunki chaar saal baad aate hai to kaaphi hip rahati he
 He appealed to the government to promote these sports further, saying, "we have modern facilities but the government should make some more efforts to promote billiards and snooker
" iske liye aakarshak, jhatpat or romaanchak toornament hone chaiye jinka tivi par prasaaran bhi kiya jaye
 Advani said that there is a need to change the packaging and marketing of the game
 unhone kaha, ‘kyuu khel kaaphi lokapriy he jise log klbon or parlor main khelte hai
 India has got the most world titles in these games
 wilson jones se shuru hua silsilaa aaj bhi chal rahaa he
 We have to change the packaging and marketing of these games, in which the corporate and media can play an important role
 ’unhone billiards or snooker main se ek ko chunane kii sambhaavna se inkaar karte hue kaha ki donon main apane pradarshan se vah khush hai or donon khelte rahenge
 Whether or not a political party storms in Gujarat elections is not known, but the nature of nature has definitely spoiled the campaign schedule of the leaders here

 Everywhere administration in the state is preparing to deal with any kind of situation
 rajya main 9 disambar ko pehle charan kaa matdaan hona he
 Prakriti has been disturbed in the color of propaganda by political parties due to such an eye-popping
 is vajah se amit shah, rahul gandhi, vasundhara raaje or yogi adityanath kii reliyon ke kaarykram ko badalanaa padaa
 Gujarat has a 1600 km long coastal border
 gujarat main chunaav ke pehle charan ke matdaan ko ab chaar din se bhi kam vakt bachaa he
 In such a situation, both the BJP and the Congress have fielded many veteran campaigners
 chakravaat okhiki vajah se gujarat ke tateey ilaakon main barish, tej hawaaen chalanaa shuru ho gaya he
 The impact of the weather is also being felt in Ahmedabad and Surat
 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh ko bhavnagar main apni reliyon ko radd karnaa padana
 Similarly, Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had to cancel their promotional programs in Surat
 pradhan sachiv, rajasav vibhaag or raahat kamishnar pankaj kumaar ne ajtak / india today ko bataaya, ‘prashasan tateey ilaakon ke jiladhikariyon se lagaataar sampark main he
 13,000 fishermen boats have gone back to sea

 The District Magistrates have been empowered to take decisions on the spot whatever they require
 bharuch se 7000 namak mazdooron ko surakshit sthanon par pahunchaaya gaya he
 Pankaj Kumar also said that there is no need to panic
 ham hai alert par hai or prashasan puri tarah taiyaar hai
 Then came the issue of Khemka's acser in the discussion
 Khemka had knocked on the door of the High Court, the number of confidential report (ACR) number of senior IAS officer Ashok Khemka of Haryana is once again in discussion
 somvaar ko antarrashtriya bhrashtachar nirodhak diwas par yojit ek kaarykram ko sambodhit karte hue mukhyamantrimanohar laal khatterne kaha ki asiaar ke number chhavi ke aadhaar par milte hai
 Ashok Khemka was also present at the event
 khatter ne khemka kaa naam liye bagaiyr yah bayaan diya
 He said that we used to help him in promotion
 jo asiaar likhi jaati he, usamen kisi ko aath number dete hai, kisi ko nau to kisi ko saadhe nau dete hai
 The Chief Minister pointed to Khemka and said that okay, nobody believes and says that i do not believe you
 main tohai courtjaoongaa
 He said that he who works with pure mind also works with pure mind for his subordinates and on top of that he gets a superior boss
 pramotion ke liye pariksha kaa diya sujhavamukhyamantri ne prashasnic adhikariyon ke pramotion ke liye ek pariksha karaane kaa suzav diya or kaha ki ise paas karnaa anivaary kiya janaa chahie
 This will help the talent to emerge
 unhone kaha ki asiaar ke alaava pariksha paas karne kaa praavdhaan isliye bhi jaruri he, kyonki aksar pramotion sifarish ke aadhaar par kiye jate hai
 The Chief Minister said that whatever you show to be as good as you are, your image is dirty
 ek chhavi banati he ki yah vyakti acha he
 Nobody can stop that good person to move forward
 kya he khemka kii asiaar kaa maamalabta den ki haryana ke tatkaaleen mukhya sachiv die dhesi nekhemkako saal 2016 -17 kii vaarshik gopneey report main 10 main se 8
 22 numbers were given
 anil vij ne khemka ke kaarykaal ko behatar bataate hue 10 main se 9
 Was given 92 marks
 vaarshik gopneey report mukhyamantri khatter ke paas pahunchi to unhone khemka ko 10 main se nau number die or kaha tha ki anil vij ne unki report ko badha chadhaakar pesh kiya he
 Khemka, angered by the reduction of points, went to the High Court from where the verdict came in his favor
 khemka ke ho chuke 53 transfaishok khemka apane kaarykaal main ab tak 53 transfar kaa dansh jhel chuke hai
 Khemka's pain was relieved when he was transferred recently
 khemka ne kaha tha ki unakoimaandaarike badale sirf jalaalat mili he
 It is now clear from the Chief Minister's statement that the stubborn attitude of Ashok Khemka does not appeal to senior officials and ministers
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne sweekaar kiya he ki varsh 1975 main apatkaal ke samay usne bhartiya nagarikon ke moulik adhikaron kaa hanan kiya tha
 At the same time, the court converted the death sentence pronounced on his behalf in the murder case to life imprisonment
 nyaayamurti aftab alam or nyaayamurti ashok kumaar ganguli kii khandpeeth ne apane ek nirnay main apatkaal kii sthiti ke sandarbh main yah raay rakhi
 The bench said that in the case of ADM v Shivkant Shukla of Jabalpur in 1976, the decision of the Supreme Court to uphold the suspension of fundamental rights by five judges was not correct
 nyaayamurti ganguli ne raay rakhi, is baat main koi andeh nahin he ki jabalpur ke ediem ke maamle main nyaayalay ke bahumat ke faisle se desh kii janata ke moulik adhikaron kaa hanan hua tha
 The judge also changed the death sentence awarded to Ramdev Chauhan alias Rajnath Chauhan, who was sentenced to death in the murder case
 khud unki maujuudagi vaali khandpeeth ne paanch may, 2009 ko sunaae apane ek faisle main chouhan ko mili maut kii sajaa ko barkaraar rakhaa tha
 Chauhan killed four people of his own family on March 8, 1992
 nyaayamurti ganguli ne kaha, jabalpur ke atirikt jila magistrate ve shivakant shukla ke maamle main nyaayalay kii ore se die gaye bahumat ke faisle ko yaad karen to usamen nyaayadhishon ne yah raay di thi ki 27 june, 1975 ko raashtrapati kii ore se jari aadesh ke anusaar pratibandhaatmak kanoon misa ke tahat hiraasat main liya gaya koi bhi vyakti anuchhed 226 ke antargat koi yachika daakhil nahin kar saktaa
 This order of the President came under Article 359 (1) of the Constitution
 apatkaal ke is maamle ke baad khandpeeth ne chouhan ke maamle main bhi spasht raay rakhi
 Earlier, a bench of the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence, stating that after the Supreme Court upheld any decision, the National Human Rights Commission does not have the authority to convert capital punishment to life imprisonment
 Recommend to the Governor for darasal, chouhan ko guwahati kii ek satr adaalat ne maut kii sajaa sunai thi
 Later the High Court also upheld this conviction
 yahi nahin, 31 july, 2000 ko ucchtam nyaayalay main nyaayamurti ke tii thomas or aar pi sethi kii khandpeeth ne bhi chouhan kii mili maut kii sajaa ko barkaraar rakhaa
 Chauhan's argument was that he was just 16 years old at the time of the incident and on this basis he could not be sentenced to death
 baad main chikitsa jaanch main nyaayalay ne paaya ki vaardaat ke samay vah 20 saal kaa tha or aise main uskaa maamla kishor nyaay adhinium ke antargat nahin aayaa
 On May 10, 2001, a bench of the court, while hearing a petition filed on the matter, again decided to uphold Chauhan's sentence by a majority
 is faisle main hi ek nyaayadhish ne ek alag raay rakhi
 This judge said that there is doubt about Chauhan's age and in this case he could have been given life imprisonment
 chouhan maamle par ek jarnal main lekh prakashit hone ke baad maanavadhikaar ayog ne dakhal diya
 The commission urged the Governor of Assam that in case of doubt about Chauhan's age, the death sentence awarded to him should be converted into life imprisonment
 ayog kii is sifarish ke baad peedit parijanon ne ucchtam nyaayalay kaa rukh kiya
 The court rebuked the Commission on May 8, 2009, stating that it had no basis for interfering in the matter
 chouhan ne ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle ko chunauti dete hue duusari baar punarvichaar yachika daayar kii
 Now on its petition, the court said, "if we look at Section 12 (j) of the 1993 Act, then it seems that the Human Rights Commission can take necessary initiatives to promote human rights
" bhartiya rigerv bank ne kaha he ki aane vaale samay main mudrasphithik dabaav ko dekhte hue byaaj daron main or katautee kii gunjaaish kam he
 Central Bank Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn told reporters on the sidelines of a FICCI meeting, 'we started the process of cutting interest rates in April
 lekin yadi aap hamaare mudrasphiti ke anumaan ko dekhen to madhyam se dderghaavadhi main mudrasphithik dabaav barkaraar he
 Thus, there is no scope for further reduction in interest rates
 ’ unhone kaha ki haalanki vruddhi or mahangaai kaa santulan sakaaratmak tareeke se badal rahaa he, madhyam se dderghaavadhi main mudrasphithik dabaav kaayam he
 The comments kareeb teen saal baad rigerv bank ke governor di subbarao ne pichley maheene laghu avadhi kii rin daron ko aadha fisad ghataakar 8 pratishat kiya tha

 75 fisad kii katautee kii thi
 This provided additional cash of Rs 48,000 crore to the banking system
 rupee main aa rahe utaar-chadhaav ke bare main gokarn ne kaha ki rigerv bank iske liye aavashyak kadam uthaa rahaa he
 He said, 'I will not guess what will happen when
 ham bazaar sthiti ke anusaar kadam uthaaenge
 ' kendriya bank ke dipti governor subir gokarn ne fikki kii ek baithak ke maukey par samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘hamane april main byaaj daron main katautee kaa silsilaa shuru kiya
 But if you look at our inflation estimates, inflationary pressures persist in the medium to long term
 is tarah byaaj daron main or katautee kii gunjaaish nahin dikhti
 He said that although the balance of growth and inflation is changing in a positive way, inflationary pressures persist in the medium to long term

 Union Minister Jairam Ramesh has once again created a stir by criticizing the 'big leaders' of his own party
 ramesh ne kaha ki congress ke bade netaaon main rajnatik samvaad kii kami dekhi gai
 He said that BJP continued to describe upa's reign as corrupt, while Congress could not give a befitting reply to its campaign
 jairam ramesh ne sweekaar kiya ki 10 saal tak satta main rahane ke baad congress ko satta virdohi lahar se muqabla karnaa he
 Ramesh said, 'we were not successful in establishing political dialogue
 raajnneetik samvaad aakhri samay main nahin hota
 You have to have political dialogue for a long time
 meraa maananaa he ki congress ko isse chot pahunchi he
 On the opposition's attacks against the government on corruption issues, he admitted that 2G, Commonwealth Games and other scams have definitely hurt the Congress' prospects
 ramesh ne kaha, ‘meraa hameshaa maananaa he ki raajnneeti kii buniyaad main se ek he samvaad or behad sheersh str se samvaad
 
 
 By 'sherpas' alone
 isliye, rajnatik samvaad kaaphi mahatvapurn he, lekin durbhaagya se hamamen iskaa abhaav rahaa
 "he said," Due to the CAG and very active judiciary, the BJP launched a very aggressive campaign and the society also jumped in its support and i believe that in that period we (congress) did not show the kind of aggression we should have shown
 
 ’ramesh ne congress ke purv sahyogi dal dramuk ko ‘kritagn’ bataakar uski aalochana kii or tatkaaleen mantri tiaar baaluu ko ‘kam na hone vaali musiibat’ bataaya
 As far as the 2014 elections are concerned, Ramesh said he was 'disappointed' with the dmk's stand
 diemke kaa tamilnadu main haal main sampann chunaav main congress ke saath gathbandhan nahin he
 Ramesh said, 'DMK got a lot from the Congress
 isse pehle, congress ke samarthan ke bina dramuk sarkaar kaa astitv nahin bachataa or vah paanch saal nahin chalati
 The DMK got (in the UPA) whatever ministry it wanted and behaved in the manner in which it wanted
 ’upie-1 main jab baaluu bhootal parivahan mantri the to unke mantralay ke adheen aane vaale bhartiya rashtriya rajmarg praadhikaran main paanch adhyaksh the
 Ramesh said, 'he (balu) was the Minister of Environment and Forests
 raja (tatkaaleen doorsanchaar mantri)
 
 
 i know what they did
 ’ramesh ne kaha, ‘meraa maananaa he ki dramuk ko congress ke prati jo uskaa rin he, uske prati thodaa or jaagruk hona chahie
 i believe that what he did to the Congress is unfortunate and in view of the immense respect that Mrs
 (sonia) Gandhi has for Karunanidhi, i believe the DMK was ungrateful
 ’yah puche jane par ki kya pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko diemke ko mantralayon ke aavanton main dridhtaa se apni baat rakhni chahie thi, to ramesh ne kaha ki gathbandhan raajnneeti kii kuch vivashataaen hai or kya charchaa hui isaki unhen jaankaree nahin he
 The DMK was part of the UPA-1 and UPA-2 till March last year and withdrew from the government on the Sri Lankan Tamils issue
 ramesh ne kaha, ‘lekin main aapse kah saktaa hum ki baaluu bhootal parivahan or paryaavaran va van mantri ke taur par kam na hone vaali musiibat the
 'he said that the facts related to the' controversy 'around Raja and Dayanidhi Maran are public

 He apologized, stating that he had made a "terrible mistake" and taking a paragraph from an article by Harvard University professor of American history, Jill Lepore, was a moral flaw
 tippaniyan Zakaria, who graduated from Yale and Harvard University, wrote a column on arms control, which appeared in the August 20 issue of Time magazine
 time ne kaha ki jakaaria ke stambh ko ek maheene ke liye roka ja rahaa he or isaki samiksha ho rahi he
 The magazine's spokesman, Ali Jalenko, said Time accepts Farid's apology, but what he did is a violation of our criteria for columnists
 unka kaam na keval tathyaatmak hona chahie, balki moulik bhi hona chahie
 His thoughts should not only be his own, but his words should also be his own
 time ne kaha, parinamswaroop ham farid ke stambh ko ek maheene ke liye roak rahe hai or aage kii samiksha jari he
 Zakaria admitted that he had stolen material from a New York magazine in an article on arms control in Time magazine, after which he was suspended by CNN and Time magazine
 unhone maafee maangate hue kaha ki unhone bhayaavah galati kii or harvard vishvavidhyalay ke america itihaas ke professor jill lepor ke lekh kaa ek para lenaa naitik khami he

 unke vichaar na keval unke apane hone chahie, balki unke shabd bhi apane hone chahie
 "as a result, we are stopping the Farid column for a month and further review is underway," Time said

 *** In Bihar, the rift between the RJD and JDU is seen to be growing steadily and there is speculation that the alliance will break even in political circles
 shanivaar ko mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or dipti siem tejasvi yadav ko ek manch par saath aana tha, lekin mahagathbandhan main padi is geth ke bich tejasvi is kaarykram main shaamil nahin hue
 Here, the nameplate of Tejaswi was kept covered, but later that nameplate was removed
 yahaan gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki jediu ne mangalvaar ko hui pradesh kaaryakarini kii baithak main apni sahyogi argedy ko tejasvi par faisla lene ke liye 4 din kaa altimetum diya tha, jiskaa aaj aakhri din he
 However, this ultimatum of JDU did not show any seriousness from RJD
 vahiin argedy supremolalu prasadne bhi yah saaf kar diya ki dipti siem post se unke bete tejasvi ke istife sawaal nahin uthta he
 After such a response from RJD, CM Nitish Kumar has called a meeting of JDU mlas at the Chief Minister's residence on Sunday
 mana ja rahaa he ki is baithak main argedy ke saath aage ke rishton par faisla liya jayega
 Let us tell you that the pressure of resignation has increased on Tejashwi after the raids of CBI and ED on Lalu Yadav and his family members for illegally making property
 haalanki lalu or tejasvi ne is aaropon ko bijepi nit centre sarkaar kii sajeesh qaraar diya he
 Tejashwi argued in his defense that this case is of 2004, when he was just 13-14 years, how can he do any scam in such a situation
 haalanki jediu kii taraf se yah kaha gaya ki party tejasvi ke in daleelon se santusht nahin he
 Then came RJD MLA Bhai Virendra's statement that RJD has 80 mlas and the Grand Alliance will have what RJD would like
 argedy vidhayak ke is bayaan par jediu ne kadi pratikriya vyakt kii he
 The JDU MLA said that Nitish Kumar is not hungry for power and it will not take even five minutes to resign
 argedy vidhayak ke is bayaan par jediu ne kadi pratikriya vyakt kii he
 The JDU MLA said that Nitish Kumar is not hungry for power and it will not take even five minutes to resign
 vahiin jediu netaa kasee tyaagi ne kaha ki nitish kumaar kii apni image he or bhrashtachar ke saath koi samjhauta nahin kiya jayega
 These strong statements seem to suggest that the countdown to the Grand Alliance in Bihar has now begun and the JDU may announce its association with the AJD in a meeting at the CM residence on Sunday
 bihar ke satta sameekaran par najar daalen, to 243 sadasyeey vidhansabha main argedy 80 siton ke saath sabase badi party he
 While JDU has 71 seats, BJP has 58 seats in its account
 congress kii 27 site hai
 Nitish Kumar became the CM of Bihar despite being second in terms of seats
 aise main nitish agar argedy ne naata tod bijepi se haath milaate hai, tab bhi vah 129 siton (71+58) ke saath bahumat kaa aankada paar kar satta main bane rahenge
 Electoral stirring is also increasing with increasing temperature

 Meanwhile, CPI (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury has targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 makapa ke mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne somvaar ko kaha he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi chunaav ke dauraan bhaajapa ke paksh main sampradayik dhruvikaran ko tej karne ke liye jhooth kaa sahaara le rahe hai
 In an election meeting in West Bengal's Jhargram, Modi criticized Yechury's recent statements about the Ramayana and the Mahabharata as derogatory
 iske jawaab main yechuri ne kaha ki modi ne jhooth kaa sahaara lekar unke bayaan kii galat vyakhya kii
 Let us tell you that Sitaram Yechury said that the battle of Ramayana and Mahabharata was full of violence
 aise main kisi ek dharm ko hinsa se jodne kaa kya tark he
 CPI (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said that in the context of bjp's nomination of Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, a candidate in the terrorism case by BJP in Bhopal, he said that terror has no religion
 yechuri ne apane bayaan ko spasht karte hue kaha ki hinsa kaa samarthan karne vaale log har samudaay main paye jate hai
 Even such people are mentioned in the Ramayana and Mahabharata
 seetaram yechuri ne aarope lagaaya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi logon kii dharmik bhavanaaen bhadakaana chaahate hai
 He said that Modi is resorting to lies for communal polarization
 ullekhneey he ki pradhanmantri modi ne ek jansabha main vamapanthiyon par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki hindutv ke viruddh apmanjanak bhashaa kaa istemaal karnaa communiston kaa shagal ho gaya he

 unhone modi ke shaadi na karne par chutki lete hue kaha, 'unhone shaadi to kii nahin, vah parivaar kaa matlab kaise jaanange

 The women's commission has expressed its second opposition to Naresh Aggarwal's statement
 ayog naresh agarwal ko notice bhejne vaala he
 Agarwal has given the controversial statement in the past
 The statement of Naresh Agarwal may be further disputed as he has made a shallow comment on the biggest face of the BJP, which is dreaming of getting power
 unhone jis tarah se parivaarwaad kaa bachaav kiya he, uski bhi kadi aalochana ho sakati he
 Naresh Aggarwal is the leader who wrongly denied Lalu to take away his right to contest
 unhone hi mumbai gangrape ke baad kaha tha ki rape kii ghatnaon se bachane ke liye ladakiyon ko apane kapadon kaa khyaal rakhana chahie
 Naresh Agarwal was in Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party before SP

 unicef kii report ‘hidden in Plain Sight’ main saamne aayaa ki bharat main 15 saal se 19 saal kii umr vaali 34 fisadi vivaahit mahilaayein aisi hai, jinhone apane pati yaa saathi ke haathon shaareerik yaa yon hinsa jheli hai
 The report also said that 77 per cent of women between the ages of 15 and 19 have been forced into sex or any other sexual act by their husband or partner at least once

 41 percent of girls in the age group of 15 to 19 years have suffered physical violence at the hands of their mother or step mother since the age of 15 while 18 percent have suffered physical violence at the hands of their father or stepfather

 a report by the United Nations Population Fund and the Washington-based organization 'international Center Research on Women' (ICRW) revealed that 6 out of 10 men in India have at some time violently treated their wife or girlfriend
 report main kaha gaya ki yah pravriti unalogon main zyada he jo aarthik tangi kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 Annapurna Maharana: March of 180 km on foot was waged by freedom fighters accepted this thing
 
 
 report ke anusaar 52 fisadi mahilaon ne sweekaara he ki unhen kisi na kisi tarah hinsa kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 Similarly, 38 per cent of women admitted to have faced physical harassment such as dragging, beating, slapping and burning
 media report ke anusaar desh main takreeban 95000 se adhik balaatkaar ke mukademen adaalaton main lambit hai
 God knows when they will be settled
 bharat main har ek ghante main 22 balaatkaar ke maamle darj hote hai
 This world was neither safe for women yesterday nor today, and the future is not known
 lekin phir bhi ham or aap milakar mahilaon lekar diwas manaate rahenge
 So that we all remember from time to time that 'respect for women' is important

 ek samay bal kalakaar ke rup main lokapriy raheen abhinetri shweta basu prasad lagbhag do saal pehle galat kaarnon se surkhiyon main ai thim, jab unhen kathith rup se veshyavriti ke aarope main giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 
 
 But now she has returned to the screen, and we are confident that the film in which she will be seen again will be very much loved, even though it will not be released in cinemas
 
 
 darasal, shweta basu prasad ek short film 'interior cafe - nite' main dikhaai deen, jisamen unke saath abhinay kii duniya ke diggaj nasiruddin shah or shernaz patel bhi maujuud hai, or vah shernaz kii yuvavastha vaala kirdaar hi nibhaa rahi hai
 
 
 In this era of youtube and social media, no short film has to wait for an event like film festivals, so, directed by Adhiraj Bose, the film was uploaded on youtube on Monday, and is now being watched and appreciated
 
 
 'interior cafe - nite' do aise chaahane waalon kii kahani he, jo 30 saal pehle bichad gaye the, or ab ve achaanak kolkata ke ek cafe main raat ko aamane-saamne aa jate hai
 
 
 In fact, when it is time to close the cafe at night, the owner of the cafe, Nasiruddin Shah, sees a customer sitting, and he postpones the intention of closing the cafe for a while
 
 
 phir jald hi ehsaas ho jaataa he ki yah mulaakaat cafe maalik or graahak ke bich nahin, do premiyon ke bich ho rahi he, jo 30 saal pehle aansuon ke sailaab or niraashaa ke gart main duube ek-duusare se alag ho gaye the
 
 
 Even after this, it seems that luck will not give them a chance of a long meeting, provided
 
 
 tippaniyan Just look at the story after that yourself, it would be better
 
 
 ham sirf itnaa or bataa sakate hai ki adhiraj bose dwaara nirdeshit is film kii sah-nirmaataa ke rup main bhi shweta basu prasad kaa naam diya gaya he, or isamen naseer, shernaz or unki yuvavastha kii bhoomika adaa kar raheen shweta ke alaava naseer ke yuva rup ko nibhaate naveen kasturiya nazar aa rahe hai
 
 
 Actually, Shweta Basu Prasad appeared in a short film 'interior Cafe - Night', in which she is also joined by acting veterans Naseeruddin Shah and Shernaz Patel, and she plays Shernaz's youthful character
 
 
 utyub or soshal media ke is yug main kisi short film ko film festivalon jaise kisi aayojan kaa intazaar nahin karnaa padataa he, so, adhiraj bose dwaara nirdeshit yah film utyub par somvaar ko aplod kii gai, or ab yah dekhi or saraahi ja rahi he
 
 
 'interior Cafe - Night' is the story of two lovers who got separated 30 years ago, and now suddenly come face to face in a cafe in Kolkata
 
 
 darasal, raat ko jab cafe band karne kaa vakt hota he, cafe ke maalik nasiruddin shah ko ek graahak baithi dikhaai detii hai, or vah cafe ko band karne kaa iraadaa kuch der ke liye multavee kar detaa he
 
 
 It is then soon realized that this meeting is not between the cafe owner and the customer, but between the two lovers, who were separated from each other 30 years ago in a flood of tears and sinks of despair
 
 
 iske baad bhi aisa lagata he ki kismat unhen zyaada lambii mulaakaat kaa mauka nahin degi, basharte
 
 
 The comments bas, iske baad kii kahani aap khud hi dekhen, to behatar hoga
 
 
 All we can tell is that Shweta Basu Prasad has also been named as the co-producer of this film directed by Adhiraj Bose, and in addition to Shweta playing the role of Naseer, Shernaz and her youth, Nasir's youth Naveen Kasturia plays Roop

 Anubhav Sinha's most awaited thriller film 'article 15 (article 15)' seems to be in trouble
 yah kathith taur par badaayun dushkarm (2014 Badaun gang rape ) or hatya se jude maamle se prerit he
 Releasing on June 28, the film has drawn resentment from the Brahmin community in Uttar Pradesh
 ayushmaan khurana (ayushmann Khurrana) kii mukhya bhoomika vaali is film artical 15 (article 15) kii shooting lakhanu or uske aasapaas hui he
 The Brahmins are troubled by the fact that the story of 'article 15 (article 15)' has been distortedly introduced with the intention of portraying the accused men as Brahmins
 unhen lagata he ki isse samudaay kii badanaami hogi
 The trailer of this film (article 15), released last week, depicts two young girls in a village brutally raped and murdered, their bodies hanging from a tree
 yah dikhaata he ki ladakiyon ke parivaar jo haashie par hai or jinhen mazdooron ke rup main kaam karne ke liye majaboor kiya jaataa he, unhen nishaanaa banaaya gaya kyonki unhone apane dainik vetan main 3 rupee kii badhotaree kii maang kii thi
 The film shows how the caste equation dominates the region
 'artical 15 (article 15)' ke trailor main yah bhi ullekh kiya gaya he ki aparaadh ek 'mahantji ke ladke' dwaara kiya gaya he
 Mahantji is depicted as a prominent figure in the Brahmin community and this angered the Brahmin community

 We have started creating awareness about this issue and we will not allow the release of the film here
 tiwari ne kaha ki agar thakur 'padmavat (padmaavat)' kii relies ko roak sakate hai, to brahman is film ko lekar apane sammaan ke liye kyon nahin lard sakate hai? unhone kaha, "ham soshal media par ek abhiyaan shuru kar rahe hai or ham film nirdeshak anubhav sinha (anubhav Sinha) se bhi sampark karne kii koshish kar rahe hai, lekin vah phone nahin uthaa rahe hai
 "he further said that while the film was being shot in Lucknow in March and April, he was not aware of the story and therefore did not protest
 is bich, film nirdeshak anubhav sinha (anubhav Sinha) se sampark nahin kiya ja sakaa, lekin film main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane vaale manoj paahwa ne ek samachar agency ko bataaya, "film puri tarah se badaayun main hue jaghanya aparaadh par aadhaarit nahin he, jahaan do ladakiyon kaa dushkarm hua tha or fande se lataka di gayi

 govinda (govinda) kii film 'rangila raja' ke thik se relies na ho paane par pehlaaj nihlani (pahlaj Nihalani) ko gussa aa gaya he or unhone film ko lekar apane dard ko khulkar byan bhi kiya he
 Pahlaj Nihalani says that his film did not get cinemas as per the requirement and it happened because the glamorous mafia runs the entertainment industry
 pehlaaj nihlani ne ieenes (IANS) se baatcheet main kaha, "mujhe sensor board ke kaamkaaj ke bare main spashtvaadi vichaaron ke liye nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he or meri vajah se mere pramukh abhinayta govinda (govinda) ko nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 If you ask me, i can say that Govinda and i are the worst enemies in the film industry
 "pehlaaj nihlani (pahlaj Nihalani) or govinda (govinda) kii 'rangila raja (rangeela Raja)' ke liye cinemagharon kii kami par nihlani ne kaha ki unhen bihar or jharkhand jaisi jagahon par film relies karne se manaa kar diya gaya tha
 He said, "these have been the traditional strongholds of Govinda, where people love his films very much
" patna yaa ranchi main ek bhi cinemaghar 'rangila raja (rangeela Raja)' pradarshit karne par sahamat nahin hua
 Why? Because my film is bad? Can only quality movies be released in theaters? And who decided that my film was cheap? a handful of critics, for whom i did not do press shows
 isliye ve mujhase pareshaan the or unhone iskaa badla meri film se liya
 "pahlaj Nihalani said," i know who they are
 main un logon ko jaanata hum, jo govinda or mujhe khatm karnaa chaahate hai
 The entertainment industry runs a glamorous mafia
 ve sabhi ek saath baithte hai, khate hai, sote hai or filmein banaate hai
 a lonely producer like me, who has no corporate involvement behind it, is being pushed out of the film industry in the name of corporate culture
 " unhone kaha ki lekin ve kahin nahin jaaenge, kyonki vah un logon se adhik samay se film udyog kaa hissaa hai, jo in chizon ko badhaava de rahe hai
 i will make another film with Govinda and prove that he is also an A-list star

 maharashtra ke aurangabad main beeti raat do samudaayon ke bich bhadki hinsa main jamkar updrav machaa
 Throughout the night people either ran scared or ran agitating violence
 patharav hua, dukaane jala di gayi, gaadiyaan phoonk di gayi
 And during this time there is no sign of police anywhere
 aurangabad ke kamishnar kaa prabhaar sambhaal rahe special IG milind bharambe ne 'ajtak' se bataaya ki nagar nigam dwaara pani kaa conection kaate jane ko lekar donon samudaayon ke bich manmutav paidaa hua, lekin afvaah bhadakaane ke chalate manmutav ne hinsa kaa rup le liya
 At present, Section 144 has been imposed in many areas including the old part of Aurangabad and a large number of police forces have been deployed
 shanivaar kii subah se sthiti kaabo main he, shanti sthapit hone laga he, lekin maahaul abhi bhi tanaavpurn bana hua he
 So far two people have died in the Aurangabad violence, while 41 people including a child and 16 policemen have been injured
 bataa den ki do maheene se aurangabad main kamishnar kaa pad rikt he or special IG milind bharambe kamishnar kaa atirikt prabhaar sambhaal rahe hai
 Not appointing the commissioner for the last two months is being seen as a gross negligence of the state government
 ajtak ne jab milind bharambe se aurangabad hinsa ko lekar sawaal puche to vah safai dete najar aae
 Aaj Tak - violence continued throughout the night
 is dauraan kahaan thi aapaki police?milind bharambe-do community ke bich main ek chote se ishyu ko lekar kuch manmutav ho gaya, jiske baad hathapayee or patharav hone laga donon taraf se
 Due to the rumor, this violence also spread to the surrounding areas
 uske baad ek do jagahon par aagjanee hui
 The violence spread more due to rumors
 lekin jahaan jaisi jarurat padi uchit bal kaa prayog kar sthiti ko kaabo main kar liya gaya
 According to the police, tear gas shells were released, lathi-charged and fired with plastic bullets, as appropriate
 ab sthiti puri tarah niyantran main he
 Aaj Tak — the person who died, was it in a mutual dispute or due to police firing? Milind Bharambe — When the crowd turned violent, the police fired a plastic bullet to gain control over the person, who took a person to a critical place She started going and died due to haemorrhage
 yah durbhagyapurna he
 Aaj Tak - Are there some serious injuries among the injured? Milind Bharambe - There is no serious injury among the injured and the condition of all is stable
 ghayalon kaa sarkari aspataal main upachaar chal rahaa he
 Aaj Tak - What initiative has the administration taken to end the tension between the two communities? Milind Bharambe - Negotiations are being held with leaders of both communities for peace restoration
 ehtiyathan upaay bhi apanaae ja rahe hai
 There is a rift between the two communities over some things that are being investigated
 ajtak-mrit vyakti kii pahchaan ho pai he kya?milind bharambe-abhi mrit vyakti kii pahchaan ujagar karnaa thik nahin hoga
 Ajatak — what is the real reason for the estrangement between the two communities? Milind Bharambe — There are rumors about some issues between the two communities
 abhi jo afvaahen hai, unki jaanch kii ja rahi he
 It would be appropriate to say something only after investigation conform hone se pehle kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Aaj Tak - Was it a well-planned preparation to incite violence? Only after Milind Bharambe investigation will be able to know what was the preparation of the rioters
 lekin jaanch se pehle is par kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Aaj Tak - How long have you been taking charge of the commissioner
 milind bharambe-ji main hi jile ke kamishnar kaa prabhaar sambhaal rahaa hum or main pichley do maheene se yah prabhaar sambhaal rahaa hum

 You brought laurels to the nation with immense contribution # zakretires # zaksnewbeginning — Anjum Chopra (@chopraanjum) October 15, 2015 loksabhaa chunaav kareeb aate hi yah ashanka phir se majboot hui he ki bhartiya chunaav main videshi dakhal ho saktaa he
 This apprehension has been strengthened by changes in the FCRA Act
 yah ashanka bevajaah nahin kahi ja sakati kyonki bijepi or congress, donon bade raajnneetik dalon ko karodon rupee kaa videshi chanda mila he
 The Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) has received 34 such instances of foreign donations to political parties
 saal 2003-04 se 2011-12 ke bich 19 aise maamle bijepi ke or 15 maamle congress ke saamne aae hai
 It was possible to get all these donations because the government changed the FCRA 2010 and 1976
 vedanta kii bhartiya sabsidiari, daao chemicals, hyaat jaisi videshi companiyon se donon raajnneetik dalon ko 1 lakh rupee se lekar 14
 Up to 5 crores have been received
 in varshon main bijepi ko videshi strot se kul 19
 4 crores and 9 to Congress
 83 karod rupee mili hai
 Why is it necessary to stop such funding? Political parties are considered to be the defenders of democracy
 ve chunaav ladate hai, sarkaar banaate hai or kanoon banaate hai
 Therefore, the donations received by them are very important in terms of our democracy and governance of the government
 lau kamishan ne chunaav sudhaaron par saal 2015 kii apni report main teen pramukh vajah bataae the ki aakhir raajnneetik dalon kii funding vyavastha main sudhaar or paardarshita lani kyon jaruri he
 The first thing is that money power disrupts the system of equalization in political parties and impairs the purity of political parties
 dhani candidet or raajnneetik dalon ko chunaav jeetne kaa zyada mauka miltaa he
 Second, black money, bribery and transactional corruption are already widely dominated in politics, helping candidates to run their election campaigns
 kamishan ne apni baat ko pukhta karne ke liye supreme court ke is quot ko aadhaar banaaya tha, 'aisa lagata he ki kuch chunavi fund kaa strot bina hisaab-kitaab vaala aapraadhik dhan hota he jinke badale unako sangrakshan miltaa he
 Similarly, it also contains black money from business groups, who expect high returns in return for this investment, bribe or commission paid on contracts
 'teesraa, aniyantrit yaa kam niyantrit chunavi funding se do tarah kii chizon ko badhaava miltaa he
 A-industry \ private institutions use the money to ensure that the rules and regulations are softened
 bi-chunaavon kii funding ke liye jo dhan istemaal kiya jaataa he, vah aakhirkaar 'anukool nitiyon' ko hasil karne main madad karata he
 All the political parties do, however, it has to be kept in mind that the changes brought in the rules are not easy to reverse now
 purvavarti endie sarkaar ne saal 2002 main supreme court ke ek aadesh ko puri tarah se palatney kaa prayaas kiya tha, is aadesh main supreme court ne kaha tha ki sabhi candidet ko chunaav ke halafname main apane shaikshanik or sampatti sambandhi vivaran ke saath hi darj aapraadhik maamalon kii bhi jaankaree deni hogi
 The NDA government first tried to stop it with an ordinance and then brought a bill for it in the Lok Sabha
 lekin supreme court ko jab yah pataa chalaa to usne is sanshodhan ko asanvaidhanik bataakar roak diya

 ISRO (indian Space Research Organization - ISRO) was about to launch the country's most powerful surveillance satellite Cartosat-3 by the end of October, but now there is a buzz that its launch could be delayed for a month

 ) bhartiya janata party ke sthapana diwas par 6 april ko maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne ascharyajanak rup se divangat bal thakare kii jamkar tarif kii
 He said, "he was not from our party, but i would like to mention his contribution in keeping Hindutva relevant
" ’’ chaar din baad hi fadavis ne ek baar phir ek akhbaar ke kaarykram menshivsenake sansthaapak kaa hawala diya
 "whenever the so-called secular parties are together, Hindutva parties should also join hands," he told Sanjay Raut, executive editor of the Sena mouthpiece Saamana
 yah bala sahab thakare kii soch thi
 Since the announcement of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray to contest the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections alone in January, the chief minister's voice and words have clearly been seen to be reconciled
 na keval fadanvis shivasena vidhayakon kii shikayaton ko khaasi tavajjo de rahe hai, balki lagata he ki bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh ne bhi apane shivasena virdohi swar ko halkaa kiya he
 Amit Shah said in Mumbai on 6 April, "we want to contest the next election together
" ’’jaankaron kii maane to ye is baat ke sanket hai ki bhaajapa main shivasena ke saath phir se gathbandhan kaayam karne kii bekaraari bad rahi he
 a survey conducted by the ruling BJP indicated that the party would lead in only 88 seats in the state
 party sutron kaa kahana he ki yadi aaj chunaav ho jaaen to party ko 44 siton kaa nuksaan hoga
 In contrast, the survey says that if a pre-poll alliance is formed, BJP can win 110 and Shiv Sena 65 seats
 lekin isamen ek duusari tasviir bhi he: yadi bhagava gathbandhan nahin bana to rajya main congress ko 80 siton par jeet mil sakati he
 Therefore, Chief Minister Fadnavis has entrusted the responsibility of negotiating with Uddhav to the state's Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar
 mana ja rahaa he ki is maheene mungantiwar jab shivesna pramukh se milenge to seat saajhedaari kaa ek nayaa formula pesh karenge
 Apart from this, there is a proposal that the upcoming monsoon session of the assembly should be held in the sub-capital Nagpur instead of Mumbai
 mungantiwar ko puraa bharosa he ki donon partiyaan ‘‘sabhi masalon kaa jald hi koi samaadhaan dhund lengi
 a senior BJP leader says that this confidence is built on a new seat sharing agreement, in which the BJP is willing to give up some seats and change some
 unke mutabik, loksabhaa ke liye bhaajapa ko 26 or shivasena ko 22 siton kii pehle vaali vyavastha kaayam rahegi
 Also, for the assembly elections, the BJP will retain its claim on the 122 seats that it currently holds, but it will give the right to the Shiv Sena to decide which of the 18 other seats where the BJP fielded its candidates
 iske alaava isamen shivasena ko centre or rajya main ‘pramukh’ mantralay dene kaa vaada bhi he
 Shiv Sena will try to negotiate as much as possible
 uddhav ne saarvajanik taur par baar-baar apana yah nirnay doharaaya he ki party akele chunaav ladegi or raut bhi daawa karte rahe hai ki bhaajapa ke saath gathbandhan phir se banane kii vastav main koi sambhaavna nahin he
 If the alliance does not happen, then people in the BJP are ready to present a strong social media campaign to present the Shiv Sena chief as 'anti-hindutva'
 pashchim bengal kii tathakthith ‘muslim samarthak’ mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ke saath uddhav kii badhati kareebi ko pasand nahin kiya ja rahaa
 The leadership of the army also knows that the BJP leadership will not hesitate to launch a fresh campaign against the 'rampant corruption' prevailing in the larger Mumbai Metropolitan Municipality (BMC) controlled by the Shiv Sena
 fadavis ne 10 april ko yah sanket diya ki shivasena ke saath chunavi gathbandhan ke liye ve kis had tak ja sakate hai
 He said, "uddhav may be the leader of Shivesana, but this is a party that follows the views of Bala Saheb

 The final match of the Tri Series released in the West Indies is to be played between Sri Lanka and India on Thursday
 team india ne pehle do match ganvaane ke baad shandaar vaapasi karte hue final main jagah banaai
 Team India, who topped the league matches with 10 points, defeated Sri Lanka by 81 runs in the last league match led by Virat Kohli
 bharat ke liye is 'karo yaa maro' mukaable main bhuneshwar kumaar ne 4 srilankai ballebaajon ko pavilion lautaaya tha
 Team India had defeated Sri Lanka in the semi-finals of the recent Champions Trophy
 lekin tri siries main bharat ko 161 ranon se haraakar srilanka ne is haar kaa badla le liya tha
 In the very first match of the series, Captain Cool Mahendra Singh Dhoni was injured and the command of the team was handed over to Virat

 At the same time, Sri Lanka have faced 2 matches in the series and 2 matches in the loss
 bharat ke khilaaf pehle match ko chhod den to srilankai ballebaajon ne apni team ko bahut niraash kiya he
 Sri Lanka have failed to perform well despite having an experienced batting order

 Rahu is calculated on the basis of Sun and Moon
 agar surya praan he to chandramaa man he, rahu isi man or praan kaa rahasy he
 Ketu, an ally of Rahu, can open the door to liberation and salvation
 yah jivan ke tamaam gyaat agyaat rahasyon ko khol saktaa he atah ise rahasyamayi grah bhi kehete hai
 What kind of deeds and sanskars you have brought from previous births and what effect they will have on life can be known from the study of Rahu in the horoscope
 rahu kaa purvajanm or vartmaan janm kaa sambandh samajhakar hi aap agyaat baadhaon se mukti paa sakate hai
 What are the effects of different expressions of Rahu? - If Rahu is in the first house of the horoscope then the person has to face the problems of family life, because he has not understood the value of his family life
 - agar rahu kundali ke dwitiya bhav main ho to vyakti bhaygrast hota he,kyonki usne pehle apni shaktiyon kaa durupyog kiya he
 - If Rahu is in the third house, then the person is adventurous, and for this reason, he is also the victim of severe accidents
 - agar rahu chaturth bhav main ho to vyakti ko kabhi sukh nahin miltaa kyonki pehle usne keval logon ko dukh hi diya he
 - If Rahu is in the fifth house, then there is pain in being a child or on behalf of the child because at first he did not respect the parents
 - chathe bhav kaa rahu vyakti ko khub sampann banataa he kyonki vyakti ne purv janm main kaaphi dharm kaary or daan kiya he
 - If Rahu is in the seventh house then one has to face many ups and downs in life, because he did not understand the value of wealth and property in the previous birth
 - agar rahu ashtum bhav main ho to vyakti kisi vishesh uddeshy ke liye janm letaa he , jo purvajanm se baaki he
 Usually the birth and death of such people are accidental
 - agar rahu navam bhav main ho to vyakti dharm bhrasht hota he,bhagya saath nahin detaa kyonki pehle usne dharm kaa paalan nahin kiya or samaaj ke liye samasyaayen paidaa kii hai
 - Rahu of the tenth house reaches a person at a height but does not give family happiness because he only wishes for status, not anything else
 - ekadash bhav kaa rahu vyakti ko vairaygy kii or le jaataa he , or aam taur par ye duniya kaa ksht uthaane kaa sankalp liya hua hota he
 - The Rahu of the Dwadsha bhava takes the person to the fort and the way, and these rites come from the previous birth

 The Congress has suffered a setback just before the elections in Madhya Pradesh
 rajya main matadaata soochiyon main baari paimaane par gadabadi hone kii congress kii shikaayat ko chunaav ayog ne jaanch ke baad galat bataaya he
 The inquiry report sent to the Congress on Friday evening by the Commission said that the investigation teams formed on the basis of the complaint inspected the voter lists in the four assembly constituencies of the state, in which no such thing has been found
 ayog ne congress ke pradesh adhyaksh camel nath dwaara teen june ko kii gai shikaayat main bataae gaye gadabadi vaale vidhansabha kshetron narela, hoshangabad, bhojpur or sioni malwa main matadaata soochiyon kii vistrut jaanch karai
 Of these, in the 82 lists of 17 polling stations in Sioni Malwa region, no mention of the names of voters was found more than once
 jabaki isi vidhansabha kshetra ke 20 matdaan kendron kii matadaata soochiyon main 2442 naam milte-julate paye gayi
 In its investigation, 2397 names were found correct, while the process of removing 45 names from the voter list due to death or transfer of the concerned voter is underway
 isi tarah narela vidhansabha kshetra kii shikaayat main matadaata suchi ke 22252 naamon main se 17684 matadaataaon ke maamle anuthe paye gayi
 Out of these, in 1776 cases, the voter's name and his relative's name were found to be the same
 inamen se 154 maamalon kii jaanch main 153 maamle sahi paye gayi
 According to the report, the investigation team investigated 552 cases mentioned in the complaint of Hoshangabad assembly constituency, in which the name of a single voter was not confirmed to be recorded multiple times in the voter list
 vahiin bhojpur main shikaayat vaale 36 maamalon kii jaanch main 29 ke naam sahi paye gayi, jabaki saat maamalon ko matadaata suchi durust karne kii prakriya ke tahat sahi kar liya jaayegaa
 The Commission concluded on the basis of detailed investigation that the complaint of the abundance of cases of the same voter being registered multiple times in the voter list in these four assembly constituencies is not correct
 ek hi tasviir vaale anek matadaata paye jane kii shikaayat ko ayog ne yah bataate huye sahi nahin paaya ki yah ek hi matadaata kaa suchi main baar-baar ullekh kaa maamla nahin he, balki yah mahaj ek hi photo ke anek baar upyog kaa maamla he jise thik karne ke liye kah diya gaya he
 On the complaint of the Election List of voters, the Commission said that in 2008, the share of voters in Madhya Pradesh by population was 52
 76 pratishat se badhkar 2018 main 61
 45 percent
 isaliye janasankhyakeey aankadon ke aadhaar par matadaata soochiyon ko apadet kiya gaya he
 On this basis, it cannot be considered a case of fake voter list
 ayog ne shikaayat ke vibhinn aadhaaron kii pukhta jaanch ke baad inhen khaarij karte huye congress se is tarah kii ashankayein paye jane par bhavishya main bhi suchit karne kaa aagrah kiya jisase shankaaon kaa tatkaal samaadhaan kiya ja sake

 There is a continuous process of recording and breaking in the statistics game cricket, but some such records have also been made, which are almost impossible to break
 jaaniye aise hi 10 khaas records
 
 
 1
 don breadman: test main 99
 a batting average of 94, Don Bradman retired from Test cricket 67 years ago, but his record of batting average in Test cricket has not been broken till date and probably will not break even further
 breadman ne 99
 He scored at an average of 94, while the second batsman in the list of best average after him is Graeme Pollock of South Africa
 pola kii ballebaaji ausat he-60
 97
 2
 Sachin Tendulkar: Breaking the record of 18426 runs scored in ODI cricket is the same as breaking the record of scoring the highest 18426 runs in ODI cricket
 is list mensachinase neeche jo ballebaaj hai, wo sabhi vanade cricket se sanyas le chuke hai
 3
 muthaiya muralidharan: 1347 ballebaajon kaa shikarainternational cricket main do hi gendbaaj 1000 wicket ke aankade ke paar pahunche
 First Muttiah Muralitharan and second Shane Warne
 murali ne 1347 wicket liye, jabaki worne 1001 ke aankade se aage nahin bad paae
 Far from breaking Murali's record, now no bowler even thinks about taking a thousand wickets in international cricket
 4
 Jack Hobbs: In first class cricket, 61760 running Jack Sir Hobbs of England showed the class he batted in first class cricket, in today's cricket no one has the ability to reach even around him
 aapako jaanakar hairaani hogi ki sachin tendulkar, rahul dravid, sunil gavaskar, riki poting or bryan lara jaise ballebaaj to first class cricket main sabase zyada ran banane vaale top 10 ballebaaji kii list main bhi nahin hai
 5
 gym lekar: ek test main 19 wicketengland ke gym lekar ne 1956 main england ke khilaaf ek test main 19 wicket lene kaa jo record banaaya tha, use itane saalon main todna to dur, is record kii koi barabari bhi nahin kar paaya
 Obviously, who will break this record, that bowler will have to take all 20 wickets in both innings of the Test match
 6
 Graham Gooch: In a Test, 456 runs Graham Gooch set this record against Team India in 1990
 unhone pehali pari main 333 or duusari main 123 ran banaae the
 After that Brian Lara also made a record of scoring 400 runs in an innings, but no batsman including Lara has been able to destroy this record so far
 7
 Wilfred Rhodes: 4204 wickets in first class cricket You will be surprised to know that this England veteran cricketer played 1110 first class matches and he is the only cricketer in the world to cross the 4 thousand wickets in first class cricket
 pichley tees saalon main koi gendbaaj top 25 first class boleron kii suchi main bhi jagah tak nahin bana paaya to ye record tootna to bahut dur kii baat he
 8
 chaminda vaas: ek vanade match main 8 wicketsrilanka ke khabbu gendbaaj chaminda vaas ne 2001 main sirf 19 ran dekar 8 wicket liye the
 Till date nobody has been able to match his record
 9
 Chris Gayle: Century in 30 balls: Chris Gayle scored the fastest T20 in IPL two years ago by hitting a century in just 30 balls
 gail kaa yah record todane ke liye har gend par teen ran se zyada kii ausat chahie
 In such a situation it is very difficult to even think about the breaking of this record
 10

 Shocked by reading, but Phil Simmons of West Indies did this feat against Pakistan 23 years ago

 ) The legendary cricketer and Rajya Sabha MP Sachin Tendulkar advocated change in the Indian Games in a planned manner so that 12 medals in the next Rio Olympics and 20 medals in 2020 are not just a dream
 tendulkar ne shikshan sansthaanon main khelon ko shaamil karne kii ichha vyakt kii thi
 He said that the inclusion of sports in the syllabus and the achievements of sportspersons like Dhyanchand, a great hockey player in the history books, would help in increasing the passion for the sports which have slowed down
 unhone maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri kapil sibbal ko likhe patr main kaha, 1951 main pandit nehru dwaara asian khelon kii sanstha ko protsaahit kiya janaa, bhartiya rashtriya gaatha kaa abhinn hissaa he, hamaare chaatro ko ise padhanaa chahie
 This helped in the formation of Delhi, so did the 1982 Asiad and 2010 Commonwealth Games
 tippaniyan Tendulkar insisted for the change in a planned way because he feels that the 'game for all' in this country is still in its early stages
 tendulkar ne kaha, main kahana chahta hum ki landan kii safalataa ke aadhaar par aage badhane kaa samay aa gaya he, hamen khelon main bada kadam uthaanaa chahie
 If we increase this rhythm in a proper way and bring some fundamental changes, then 12 medals in Rio or 20 medals in 2020 will not be just a dream
 unhone kaha ki haryana main 'centre of excilence' se kushti or mukkebaaji main madad milegi

" tendulkar ne khel vigyaan rashtriya santhaan banane kii baat kii or kaha ki bharat ko isaki kaaphi jarurat he
 Tendulkar had expressed a desire to include sports in educational institutions
 unhone kaha ki paathyakram main khelon ko shaamil karne or itihaas kii kitabon main mahaan hockey khilaadi dhyanchand jais khilaadiyon kii uplabdhiyon ko shaamil karne se un khelon ke prati junun badhaane main madad milegi, jinka vikaas kam hua he
 In a letter to HRD Minister Kapil Sibal, he said, "in 1951, Pandit Nehru's encouragement to the Asian Games organization is an integral part of the Indian national saga, our students should read it
" isse dilli ke banane main madad mili, isi tarah 1982 asiad or 2010 rashtramandal khelon se bhi aisa hi hua
 The comments tendulkar ne suniyojit tareeke se parivartan ke liye jor isliye diya, kyonki unhen lagata he ki is desh main 'sabhi ke liye khel' ab bhi shuruaati daur main hi hai
 Tendulkar said, i want to say that the time has come to move forward based on the success of London, we should take a big step in the Games
 agar ham uchit tareeke se is lay ko badhayen or kuch moulik parivartan le aaen, to rio main 12 padak yaa 2020 main 20 padak sirf sapana hi nahin hoga
 He said that the 'center of Excellence' in Haryana would help in wrestling and boxing
 sibbal ne kaha tha, ham sachin tendulkar ke prastaav kaa swaagat karte hai or maine unhen iskaa prastutikaran dene ke liye aamantrit karne ke liye pehle hi likh diya he
 Tendulkar talked about setting up a National Institute of Sports Sciences and said that India needs it very much

 BCCI President n Srinivasan does not seem to have any difficulties
 ab purv bisisiai chif sharad pavaar ne bhi shrinivasana par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Sharad Pawar held a press conference on Wednesday and said that Srinivasan should resign till the matter is investigated
 pavaar ne kaha ki mai unki jagah hota to ye sab nahin hota
 Pawar supported former BCCI president Shashank Manohar's suggestion that the home ministry should investigate the spot-fixing and betting case in the IPL
 pavaar ke mutabik ipel ke sabhi maichon kii jaanch honi chahie
 Sharad Pawar said that i am hurt by this whole controversy
 isse bhartiya cricket kii chhavi ko jhatka laga he
 He attributed n Srinivasan to this situation
 gauratlab he ki sattebaaji prakaran main damaad gurunath mayppan kii giraftaar ke baad se shrinivasana par istipha dene kaa dabaav he
 But he has been denying this
 aapako bataa den ki mangalvaar ko board ke varisht adhikari jyotiraditya sindhiyadwara virodh kii aawaaj uthaane ke baad buudhvaar ko rajeev shukla ne unke damaad gurunath mayppan kii sattebaaji prakaran main bhoomika par jaanch prakriya se unhen dur rahane kii salaah di

 But if there is no dispute about speech, speech cannot work
 mujhe laga ki vivaad isliye he ki din he teachers kaa, lekin pradhanmantri bacchon ko kyon sambodhit kar rahe hai kyonki unke liye to abhi 14 november nahin aayaa
 On Teacher's Day, students meet with their teachers, give them cards, thank them, and many teachers get emotional and also return home to see how much affection and respect the students received today
 is baar vivaad ho rahaa he ki shikshak diwas ke din pradhanmantri jabaran chaatro ko bithakar bhaashan sunaayenge or isaki taiyaari main din bhar shikshak principal sahab lage rahenge
 Dialogue is a legitimate way in politics and what is the problem if the Prime Minister keeps communicating? First a look at the circular which was disputed
 dilli sarkaar ke shiksha nideshaalay ne 29 agast ko dilli ke sarkari or privet skulon ko nirdesh jari kiya
 Only the word instruction is used in the letter
 yahi ki pradhanmantri dopaher teen baje se paune paanch baje tak desh ke bacchon ko sambodhit karenge or sawaal jawaab hoga
 It will be broadcast from the national and regional channels of Doordarshan
 patr main likhaa he ki kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantralay kaa nirdesh he ki puure desh ke skulon ko aisi vyavastha kerani hogi jisase bachche pradhanmantri ke bhaashan kaa sidhaa prasaaran dekh saken
 Therefore, all the children will have to gather for one hour before the Prime Minister's program, that is, between two and a half to five to five o'clock
 is din sabhi sarkari skulon main ek hi shift hogi
 That too from one to five and a half
 privet skool apane sansadhano kii zarurat ke anusaar paanch sitambar ko subah aath baje se paanch baje tak kaa samay chun sakate hai yaa ek baje se saadhe paanch kaa samay chun sakate hai
 Heads of schools will have to arrange adequate number of TV set-top boxes, amplifiers, projectors, generator sets, inverters so that students can watch and listen to the pm's speech
 sarkari skulon main iske liye jo kharchaa aayega, vah wikees fund se bharaa jayega
 From the fund of VKS i
e
 School Welfare Committee
 taiyaariyon ke bare main sabhi zila shiksha nideshalayon ko do sitambar ko shaam paanch baje tak report deni hogi
 All principals are instructed to inform parents and parents about this
 skool kii diary main likhakar, esemes ke zariye, notice board par likhakar aadi−aadi
 Mid-day meal will also be given between one and a half to two o'clock and this information should be given to the mid-day meal person in advance
 agar zarurat ho to is kyrkram ke liye skool prabandhan samiti ke sadasyon ko bhi bulaayaa ja saktaa he
 All principals must ensure that discipline remains in schools during the live telecast of the speech
 kyrkram shuru hone se pehle pradhanacharyon ko yah detail dena hoga ki kitne chaatr online modul se dekh rahe hai
 All DDE Education Officers, Deputy Education Officers will visit the schools while the speech is going on to see if it is being followed as stated
 agar isamen koi laaparvaahee hui to use gambhirtha se liya jayega
 IAS Padmini Singla is signed on this instruction letter
 aaj kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri smriti irani ne kaha he ki nirdesh jari nahin kiye gaye, jabaki dilli sarkaar kii chitthee main to yahi likhaa he ki maanav sansaadhan mantralay kii taraf se nirdesh aayaa he
 The Union Minister has said, 'I want to say that this activity is completely voluntary
 agar is mudde par koi galatfahami hui he or iskaa raajnneetikaran kiya ja rahaa he to yah afsosna he
 ' kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantralay kii sachiv rajshri bhattacharya ne rajyon ke shiksha sachivon ko is sambandh main khat likhaa he
 It is definitely written in this letter that all the schools can arrange for 'may make' arrangement so that all the schools can do so that the children can watch the live telecast of the Prime Minister's speech
 dur daraaj ke ilaakon main jahaan tivi yaa signal nahin he, vahaan radio set kaa intazaam kiya jaae
 It is written in it that immediately after the program, feedback will be taken that the entire report of how many children attended and how many schools managed will have to be sent to the states
 bhaashan to sunanaa hi padegaa, nahin to koi afasar dekh legaa
 Before coming to a political controversy, its aspects first come to nomenclature
 tamaam circular main paanch sitambar ke din ko shikshak diwas hi kaha gaya he
 But perhaps political parties have objected to the advertisement being called Gurotsav
 maanav sansaadhan mantri smriti irani ne yah kaha he ki us din niabandh pratiyogita hogi, jiskaa naam gurutsav he
 Several Tamil Nadu parties DMK, PMK have objected
 karunanidhi ne kaha he ki centre is diwas kaa hindi namakaran kar tamil bhashaa ko parajeet karne kii saazish kar rahaa he
 Wants to destroy Tamil culture
 endie kii sahyogi party emdmake netaa vico ne centre sarkaar se maang kii he ki vah teachers de ko guru utsav ke rup main manaane kaa faisla waapas le
 West Bengal Education Minister Partha Chatterjee has said that we have also received instructions but we will not follow
 rajya sarkaar apane kaaryakramon kaa anusaran karegi
 Schools in Maharashtra say that state schools are closed till September 4 due to Ganesh Chaturthi, so it is difficult to make arrangements
 saath hi vahaan aachaar samhita lagu he
 While welcoming the circular, Bihar Education Minister Vrishan Patel has instructed all officers to do everything possible, but their advice is that the Prime Minister should have met the students on Children's Day on 14 November
 unka kahana he ki ye aadhi adhuri koshish he, chachaa nehru kii tarah chachaa modi banane kii


 The School Education Minister of Madhya Pradesh says that private schools have facilities, so they will not have problems
