 Soon the government will introduce a new catering policy for the railways
 aapako bataa den ki niyantrak evam lekha pareekshak (CAG) kii report main iskaa khulaasa hua he
 The audit report of the CAG on the catering service of the Indian Railways is to be laid in Parliament on Friday
 report main bataaya gaya he ki railway steshnon par jo khaane-pine kii chijen parosi ja rahi hai, wo insaani istemaal ke laayak hi nahin hai
 According to the report, the things being served at trains and stations are polluted
 dibbaband or bottleband chizon ko expyri date ke baavjood bechaa ja rahaa he
 The CAG has also written in its report that the scam was done during the distribution of contracts
 yahaan tak ki khaane ko gandagi se bachaane ke liye cover karne se staff ankhe munde rahaa
 Now railway officials are calling for action
 jaanch main yah bhi paaya gaya ki railway parisar or trainon main saaf-safai kaa bilkul dhyaan nahin rakhaa ja rahaa

 sieji or railway kii joint team ne 74 steshnon or 80 trainon kaa muyna karne ke baad is report ko taiyaar kiya he

 bhartiya bazaar main wireles headfones kii demand badhati hi ja rahi he
 People are now preferring wireless headphones over wired headphones
 lekin bajet main acchhee sound quality vaala wireles headphone milanaa aasaan nahin hota he
 Meanwhile, popular audio brand Skullcandy launched its Jib + wireless headphones in the market recently
 company ne isaki keemat 2,499 rupee rakhi he
 However, it is currently being sold on Amazon for Rs 2,070
 hamane is headphone ko kaaphi dinon tak istemaal kiya he or ab iskaa rivyuu aapako bataane ja rahe hai
 Design and Build Quality: These headphones are made entirely of rubber
 iskaa nek band vaala part jaraa sa chaudaa he
 But its overall structure is much different than other neckbands
 iskaa batan vaala part plastic he
 The rest of the earbuds are kept simple
 yahaan extra grip ke ekstranal flap diya gaya he
 This allows the grip to sit properly, but the earbuds are not able to get inside the ears in a better way
 isaki vajah se sound quality par asar padataa he
 In such a situation, for better sound quality, i suggest removing this flap
 overol iskaa luk impressive nahin he
 You will be very nervous to carry it, because its neckband part is also directly like wire, so there is a lot of trouble in adjustment
 iske alaava vir kaaphi lanbaa he or yearbads ko jodakar rakhane ke liye magnet bhi nahin diya gaya he
 The lack of magnets causes the earbuds to remain separate and difficult to handle
 chunki magnet nahin he isliye magnet switch kii baat hi yahaan rahane dete hai
 However a good thing is that it is not heavy to carry in the neck
 buttens kii baat karen to left said ke vir main hi ise in-line kiya gaya he
 Here are three buttons
 do wolum rockers ke alaava bich main ek multi batan he
 Holding it down for three seconds turns it on / off
 saath hi multi batan se hi kol risive or cat kiya ja saktaa he
 At the same time turning on and holding for 5 seconds makes it ready for Bluetooth pairing
 yahaan LED diya gaya he jo blink karne lagata he
 Also, here is a Micro USB port for charging
 is headphone main bluetooth varjan 5
 0 is used
 aise main yahaan fast connactivity milti he
 Apart from this, virtual assistant can also be activated with multi button here
 wolum rockers kii baat karen to + sin se wolum ap hota he or - sin se wolum down hota he or inhen 2 second tak dabaa kar rakhane se trek ko previous or next kiya ja saktaa he
 Performance: We will talk about audio output, calling and battery in performance here
 sabase pehle baat karaten hai audio output kii to aapako bataa den yahaan company ne 9mm drivers ko istemaal kiya he
 Overall audio quality is quite balanced
 hamane clasical, cicedelik rock, jaij, rock, dabstep, EDM, BDM, metal, trans or fok jaise kai jonurs ke saath yuj kiya he or saare jonurs isaki parformens kaaphi acchhee he
 Highs, mids and lows are all clear notes
 haalanki base main thodaa panch missing he or sab base thodaa or behatar ho saktaa tha
 Nevertheless, it can be ignored in terms of price
 kulamilaakar tuning kaaphi acchhee he
 Talking about the battery, the company has claimed 6 hours and the company's claim justifies here
 microphone kii baat karen to ye colling ke liye bhi behatar he
 But in crowded places, you may get upset using it, because there is no passive noise cancellation here
 faisla:ab sawaal ye he ki kya aapako ise khareednaa chahie? to jawaab ye he ki agar aap bajet main behatar audio quality chaahate hai to isamen paisa laga sakate hai
 In terms of look and design, it has faded a bit
 sports activity ke liye bhi ise khareednaa shaayad behatar nahin hoga

 'khot in Kamal Nath's intention' - BJP, while the BJP has declared the reservation announcement as a symbol of Khot in Kamal Nath's intention

 Amid chaos in SP, Amar Singh said in Lucknow today that i am not together with five ideologies
 unhone kaha ki main chor daravaaje se raajnneeti karne kaa aadi nahin hum
 However, added that politics is quite cruel and ruthless
 upi main apane kaarobaar ke masale par jawaab dete hue kaha ki maine vahaan ek paise kaa vyapaar nahin kiya
 With that said that i am not obstructing Akhilesh's progress
 unako yashasvi hone kaa aashirwad detaa hum
 i have come to Lucknow only because there is peace between father and son
 tippaniyan Speaking on the coup in SP and the strength of the Akhilesh camp in favor, Amar Singh said that Mulayam is unconcerned, it is not our ability to listen

 Status is made up of personality
 haalanki unhone sawalia lahaze main yah bhi joda ki shivpal ke daagi saathi ab akhilesh ke saath milakar safed kaise ho gaye hai
 It is worth mentioning that on 1 January, a faction of the SP rebelled from the party, choosing Akhilesh Yadav as the national president of the party and Amar Singh was expelled from the party
 mulaayam singh ko rashtriya adhyaksh se bedakhal karne ke saath hi shivpal yadav kaa party pradesh ke adhyaksh kaa pad bhi chin liya gaya
 Akhilesh Khema also confronts Amar Singh at the root of the feud between the party and father-son
 sapa main takhtapalat hone or akhilesh kheme ke paksh main sankhya bal hone par bolte hue amar singh ne kaha ki mulaayam be-haisiyat hai, ye sunne kii hamaari kshamta nahin he
 Also said that we do not understand the status of anyone with the strength of numbers
 haisiyat vyaktitv se banati he
 However, he also added to the question of how Shivpal's tainted partner has now become white along with Akhilesh
 ullekhneey he ki sapa main mache ghamaasan ke bich ek janvari ko sapa ke ek dhade ne party se baghawat karte hue ek akhilesh yadav ko party kaa rashtriya adhyaksh chun liya or amar singh ko party se baahar nikaal diya gaya
 With the ouster of Mulayam Singh from the national president, Shivpal Yadav's post of party state president was also taken away
 akhilesh khemaa party or pita-putr main jhagade kii jad bhi amar singh ko tehraata he

 There are reports that Hrithik Roshan is planning to cast Ram and Deepika Padukone in the role of Sita
 is bich khabaren hai ki south superstar prabhas ko ravan kaa role nibhaane ke liye approach kiya gaya he
 In conversation with Pinkvilla recently, Nitesh Tiwari had said - After Chichore i am going to make Ramayana
 ye ek trilogy hogi
 We are doing everything possible to build this project
 jab nitesh se deepika or ruthik roshan ko cast karne ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha- ham abhi concept level par hai
 We haven't even thought about casting yet
 magar prodction se jude ek sutara ne bataaya ki ramayana main pehali baar ruthik-deepika screen share karenge
 Apart from this, a popular superstar will play the role of Ravana
 sutara ne khulaasa kiya ki mekars ne ramayana ke liye 600 karod kaa bajet rakhaa he
 This is the largest budget signed for any Indian film
 ye puure bharat main relies hogi
 It will be released in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu
 team chaahati hai ki bahubali star prabhas ravan kaa role play kare
 He believes that Prabhas' personality will suit this character
 unki fijic ravan ke role ke liye ekadam feet he
 But the deal is not locked yet
 abhi prabhas ne kuch faisla nahin liya he
 According to the source, Allu Aravind, Namit Malhotra and Madhu Mantena have joined hands with Nitesh Tiwari for this project for the first time
 narendra modi ke netritv vaali bijepi ko 2019 main maat dene ke liye sapa kisi bhi surat main basapa kaa saath nahin chhodana chaahati he
 This is the reason why the SP is also ready to become the bsp's junior partner in UP
 2019 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle gathbandhan ko lekar basapa adhyaksh mayawati kaa dabaav kaam aane laga he
 SP chief Akhilesh Yadav while addressing a gathering in Mainpuri on Sunday said that he was willing to give up for the alliance and he would not back down if he had to compromise on two to four seats for the alliance
 bataa den kimayawati ne kairana loksabhaa upachunaavake pehle saaf kar diya tha ki agar unhen sammanjanak siten nahin milin to unki party akele hi chunaav ladegi
 Mayawati's statement was seen as a big political statement, which contained an insistence on treating her as a great partner
 mainpuri main akhilesh yadav ne ek baar phir gathbandhan ke liye mayawati ke saamne apane hathiyaar daal die hai or tyaag ke naam par unhoneymayawati ko bade partnerake taur par manjuur bhi kar liya he
 Now it remains to be seen how many seats are compromised between the two parties after Akhilesh Yadav is ready to become almost junior partner
 gauratlab he ki upi main kul 80 sansadeey siten he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP alliance won 73 seats in the Modi wave
 sapa ko 5 or congress ko 2 siten mili thi
 While bsp's account was also not opened
 isi tarah se pichley saal hue upi vidhansabha chunaav main sapa ne basapa se zyada siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 Although both parties contested in these elections separately
 phulpur-gorakhpur upachunaav main sapa ko basapa ne samarthan kiya tha
 As a result, the BJP suffered a crushing defeat
 iske baad se donon partiyaan ke bich rishte majboot hue hai
 This is the reason why Akhilesh Yadav is not ready to leave the BSP in any way

 The Bombay High Court has expressed displeasure over the lack of auction of luxury aircraft by industrialist Vijay Mallya
 court ne mangalvaar ko seva kar vibhaag ko nilaamee mulya kaa dobaaraa aankalan karne ke nirdesh die hai
 The court has said that the documents will be presented before the court before fixing the price, after which the department will be given time for the auction
 court main bahes ke dauraan seva kar vibhaag kii ore se safai di gai ki nilaamee ko lekar jo nivida mili vah arakshit keemat se kaaphi kam he, isi vajah se nilaamee prakriya puri nahin ho pai he
 However, the counsel for Mumbai International Airport said that the department is finding itself unable to recover the money from the auction
 aise main airport par vimaan ke parking charge kaa bakaayaa bhugtan kaise kiya jayega
 It was argued by the airport management that Mallya's aircraft is affecting other important works at other airports
 maalya ke vimaan ne airport par sirf jagah gher rakhi he gher rakhi he or use kabad main bech dena chahie
 Vijay Mallya's luxury aircraft 'airbus A319' has been parked since December 2013
 seva kar vibhaag teen koshishon ke baavjood ab tak isaki nilaamee nahin ho pai he
 Industrialist Vijay Mallya owes around Rs 9,000 crore to many banks in the country
 maalya desh chhodkar faraar ho chuke hai or ab unki sampatti bechakar karja vasuusane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman made several announcements to relieve the slowdown in different sectors, industry and the common man to remove the slowdown in the market and bring the economy back
 nirmala sitaraman bhale hi duusare deshon se tulana karke bharat kii aarthik mandi se zyada na ghabaraane kii baat kar rahi hon lekin ground par aarthik mandi ke halaat duusari tasviir pesh kar rahe hai
 The recession clouds are becoming increasingly black and dense and the impact is beginning to be seen on sectors such as auto, real estate, telecom and banking to steel and textiles
 aarthik mandi kii mukhya taur par ye chaar vajah hai
 
 
 The first reason is the rising prices of crude oil in the international market, which has had an impact on inflation
 - duusari vajah dollar ke mukaable rupee kii ghatati hui keemat he, ek america dollar kii keemat 72 rupee ke aankade ko chhu rahi he
 - The decline in exports over imports increased the country's fiscal deficit and decreased foreign exchange reserves
 - iske alaava america or china ke bich jari trade war kii vajah se bhi duniya main aarthik mandi kaa khatra teji se bad rahaa he, jiskaa asar bharat par bhi padaa he
 Well these are external reasons, which are fueling the economic slowdown in the country
 lekin isaki andruni vajah zyada badi hai
 Things such as a decline in important industrial sectors of the economy, a constantly narrowing gap between demand and supply, and a slight decrease in investment are pointing to a slowdown
 jiskaa asar ab dikhaai dene laga he
 Know such things that are sounding the alarm of economic recession
 
 
 
 
 - desh kaa auto sector reverse gear main chalaa gaya he
 The auto industry has been witnessing a decline in sales for nine consecutive months
 july main car or motorcykilon kii bikri main 31 fisadi kii giravat ai he
 Because of which more than three and a half lakh employees associated with the auto sector lost their jobs and about 1 million jobs are in danger
 - krishi kshetra ke baad sabase zyada 10 karod logon ko rojgaar dene vaale textile sector kii bhi haalat kharaab he
 The Northern India Textile Mills Association has, by advertising in newspapers, revealed that 34 in the country's textile industry
 6 fisadi kii giravat ai he
 Because of which 25 to 30 lakh jobs are expected to be lost
 - isi tarah ke halaat real estate sector main hai, jahaan march 2019 tak bharat ke 30 bade shaharon main 12 lakh 80 hazaar makaan banakar taiyaar hai lekin unke kharidaar nahin mil rahe
 That is, people are not buying at the speed at which builders are building houses
 -RBI dwaara haal main hi jari aankadon ke mutabik bainkon dwaara udyogon ko die jane vaale karj main giravat ai he
 Sectors such as petroleum, mining, textiles, fertilizers and telecom have reduced borrowing
 yah mandi kii aahat kaa hi asar he ki april se june 2019 kii timahi main sona-chaandi ke aayaat main 5
 There has been a decrease of 3 percent
 jabaki isi dauraan pichley saal isamen 6
 a 3 percent gain was seen
 nivesh or audyogic utpaadan ke ghatane se bhartiya share bazaar main bhi mandi kaa asar dikh rahaa he
 After touching the figure of 40 thousand, the Sensex is stuck again at 37 thousand
 kendriya sankhyikee sanghathan dwaara jari aankadon ke anusaar 2018-19 main desh kii jidipi vikaas dar 6
 8 percent which is the lowest in the last 5 years
 jiske baad arabiai ne mandi kii aahat ko bhaanpate hue saal 2019-20 ke liye vikaas dar kaa anumaan ghataakar 6
 9 percent tax
 yah wo aankade hai jo aarthik mandi se desh ko khabardaar karte hai
 About which NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar has also warned the country and has also put government policies and decisions on the economic downturn
 aarakshan ko lekar rashtriya swayan sevak sangh (aresas) pramukh mohan bhagwat ke bayaan ke baad vipaksh dal tilamilaae hue hai
 The Congress accused the RSS and the BJP of being anti-dalit backward
 vivaad badhata dekh ab aresas se safai jari kii he
 RSS All India Publicity Head Arun Kumar said that an attempt was being made to create unnecessary controversy over a part of speech given by Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat at an event in Delhi
 unhone twitor par jari bayaan main kaha ki samaaj main sadbhaavna purvak paraspar baatcheet ke aadhaar par sab prashnon ke samaadhaan kaa mahatv bataate hue aarakshan jaise samvedansheel vishay par vichaar vyakt karne kaa aahvaan kiya tha
 Arun Kumar said that as far as the opinion of the Sangh is on the subject of reservation, it has been clarified many times that the union fully supports the reservation of backward castes on the basis of scheduled castes, tribes, obcs and economies
 vahiin, bhaajapa netaa shahanvaj hossain ne bhi bhagwat kaa paksh lete hue kaha ki sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat ne kaha he ki aarakshan ko lekar samvaad hona chahie isamen kya galat kaha he? samvaad par kisi ko kya aapatti he? unhone aage kaha ki piem modi pehle hi kah chuke hai aarakshan tha, aarakshan he or aarakshan rahegaa
 He said that even before Mohan Bhagwat's statement was misunderstood, it is still being misunderstood
 modi sarkaar ne aarakshan ko khatm karne ke bajaay saamaanya jatiyon ko 10 pratishat aarakshan diya he wo bhi essi / asti yaa obisi ke cote ke aarakshan ko kam kiye bina jiskaa swaagat essi / asti or obisi virgon ne bhi kiya tha
 Hussain said that i think the opposition is trying to do politics on this but they will not succeed on this
 aresas ke akhil bhartiya prachaar pramukh arun kumaar ne ek twit main kaha, 'jahaan tak sangh kaa aarakshan ke vishay par mat he, vah kai baar spasht kiya ja chukaa he ki anusuchit jati (essi), anusuchit janajati (asti), anya pichhadaa varg (obisi) or aarthik aadhaar par pichhadon ke aarakshan kaa (aresas) purna samarthan karata he
 Kumar said in the tweet that unnecessary controversy is being raised on a part of Mohan Bhagwat's speech given at an event in Delhi
 gauratlab he ki bhagwat ne ravivaar ko kaha tha ki jo aarakshan ke paksh main hai or jo iske khilaaf hai, un logon ke bich is par sadbhaavpurn maahaul main baatcheet honi chahie
 Opposition parties like the Congress and the BSP have attacked the BJP and its ideological organization RSS over Bhagwat's remarks
 congress pravaktaa randeep singh surajevaala ne kaha ki bhagwat kii tippanee ne aresas-bhaajapa kaa 'dalit-pichhadaa virdohi' cheharaa benakaab kar diya he

 The South African batsmen beat the Indian bowlers fiercely in the fifth and final ODI, but captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni defended them saying that they were not getting any special help from the wicket
 dakshin africa ne pehle ballebaaji karte hue chaar wicket par 438 ran kaa vishaal score banaaya or phir bharat ko 36 overon main 224 ran par out kar diya
 Dhoni said after the match, South Africa started their batting brilliantly and later they continued to score fast
 jaisaa ve khel rahe the 350 se adhik kaa score bananaa tay lag rahaa tha
 But it was a good wicket for batting
 unhone kaha, hamaare tej gendbaajon ko pich se madad nahin mil rahi thi
 His bouncers also proved to be unsuccessful
 hamaare spinneron ko bhi turn nahin mil rahaa tha
 We know Wankhede's wicket that nothing was favorable for our bowlers
 tippaniyan Regarding chasing India's target, he said, all batsmen tried their best
 lekin jab 25wein over ke baad ran rate 15 ran prati over se upar pahunch gaya, tab hamaare liye kaam mushkil ho gaya tha
 It was a match that put us out of the race to win the series, said Dhoni
 lekin cricket main aisa hota he or ham kuch khaas nahin kar sakate
 Dhoni, who retired from Test cricket, said that India will do well in the Test series against South Africa starting November 5 in Mohali
 unhone kaha, yah acchhee santulit team he
 We have good fast bowlers and spinners, who can perform well
 hamaare paas aise ballebaaj hai, jo acha pradarshan kar rahe hai
 The team will do well
 dhoni ne match ke baad kaha, dakshin africa ne apni ballebaaji kii shuruyaat shandaar kii or baad main usne teji se ran banane jari rakhe
 As they were playing, a score of more than 350 seemed certain to be scored
 lekin yah ballebaaji ke liye acha wicket tha
 He said, our fast bowlers were not getting help from the pitch
 unke bounsar par bhi naakaam sabit hue
 Our spinners were also not getting turn
 ham vankhede ke wicket ko jaanate hai ki hamaare gendbaajon ke liye kuch bhi anukool nahin rahaa
 The comments bharat ke lakshya ke peechha karne ke bare main unhone kaha, sabhi ballebaajon ne apni taraf se sarvshereshth prayaas kiya
 But when the run rate reached above 15 runs per over after the 25th over, the task was difficult for us
 dhoni kaha, yah ek aisa match rahaa, jisane hamen siries jeetne kii daud se baahar kiya
 But this happens in cricket and we cannot do anything special
 test cricket se sanyas le chuke dhoni ne kaha ki bharat, dakshin africa ke khilaaf 5 november se mohali main shuru hone vaali test siries main acha pradarshan karegi
 He said, it is a well balanced team
 hamaare paas achche tej gendbaaj or spinner hai, jo acha pradarshan kar sakate hai

 - Worship is not necessary after bhajan, while worship is necessary after kirtan
 - bhajan ek geet kii tarah he, jabaki kirthan kisi mantra vishesh kaa uccharan he

 As a promoter, will you try to make Vijender Singh the best boxer that he can be, or use his appeal to make India a professional boxing market? Of course the two agendas can work together, but here it is more appropriate to say It may be that the opinion in this case can be a little different
 is had tak ki yah sochna padataa he, peshewar mukkebaaji main 10 main se 10 mukaable jeet chuke mashhoor vijender se kahin chook to nahin ho gai
 For how long will they compete against boxers for small titles? The fact that Vijender has won all his matches so far
 saatven mukaable main australia ke kerri hope ko haraakar unhone khaali padi dablyubio asia-pacific super middle wet belt hasil kii or teen baar se yah unheen ke paas he
 Apart from this, he also received the WBO Oriental Super Middle Weight Belt
 ye uplabdhiyaan buree nahin
 Only those who fight you can beat them
 magar yah bhi sach he ki vijender ne ab tak jinhen haraaya he, ve aise nahin hai jo nami mukkebaajon ke dilo-dimag main khauf paidaa karen
 Let's boxrec
 com par unke pichley teen pratidwandviyon ke bare main jaanate hai, jisaki ranking dablyubio, dablubie, dablubisi, ibf vagairah kii ranking se zyada bharosemand maani jaati he
 Francis Cheka is ranked 236th worldwide, Zulfiqar Maimatiali 94th and Ernest Amuzu 213rd
 unhen haraana 43veen ranking vaale vijender ke liye zyada mushkil nahin hona chahie tha
 But it happened

 Professional level boxers start with easy rivals
 yah khel kaa hissaa he
 This makes the records look better, raising the rankings
 phir mushkil mukaable aate hai, jo kadaa imtihaan lete hai
 This side or that side
 bachanaa mushkil
 Vijender is now in the same era and things should change rapidly from here
 maamla pechida he
 British boxer Rocky Fielding landed in the ring against Tyron Jegg in July
 fielding zyaadaatar chakachaundh se dur, or aise mukkebaajon se ladate rahe hai jinhen vijender ne takreeban sabhi muqablon main haraaya he, jabaki jeg "regular'' dablubie super middlawet khitaabadhari hai ("super'' khitaab ke bainks jo 2017 se britain ke jord gruves ke paas he)
 Fielding won the match
 jeg paanch round main chit
 Looking at the match between Jegg and Fielding, you would think that Vijender would have dealt well against either of them, as his defensive and alert style would have been heavier on both offensive games
 aisa na hota, to bhi vijender zyada sanjeeda belt ke daavedaar hote
 Now the matter of the marque: There was talk of the fielding-vijender match recently, but it did not happen
 videshon main vijender ke muqablon kii manager queensberi promotions ke francis warren kaboolte hai ki is mukaam tak "vijender ko or aage pahunchaa dekhakar mujhe acha lagata
 "there was definitely going to be a fight against Lee Markham for the Commonwealth Belt in July, which could not happen due to Markham's injury
" par ek dilachasp baatah kaamanwealth khitaab abhi haal tak fielding ke paas tha or phir unhone zyada bade muqablon ke chakkar main ise chhod diya
 That is why he did not fight to fight Vijender
 vijender alabatta apni raftaar se zyada pareshaan nahin
 They are preparing for the next fight against "a big boxer" (wait name) for the Commonwealth title in September
 ve maanate hai, fielding se muqabla na hona acha hi hua
 "i'm not desperate
 kyonki ab ve vishwa champion hai or ab main vishwa championships ke liye laduunga
 Now i need to match the first, second and third numbers
 ''vijender khush or aatmavishvaas se bhare hai
 There is also a happy Warren, but he adds, "in their case we are three-four months behind
 '' or vakt bhaag rahaa he
 He is 32 years old, just a year away from the age when Andre Ward, a previous super-middleweight, retired
 ve kisi bhi maujuuda champion se kam se kam do saal bade hai
 The good thing from Vijender's point of view is that three to four months is not much to get into professional boxing
 yahaan ek baar 12 round ke muqablon main pahunch jane par saal main ek yaa do fite bahut hai
 Nirav Tomar of ios Sports, Vijender's managerial company in India, says, "we are not too worried
 '' warren or tomars kii maane to vijender bade khitaabi mukaable kii ore bad rahe hai
 "tomar," whichever international title is available
 '' or warren ke shabdon main, "agle 12 maheenon main dablyubio khitaabi muqabla sambhawatah vishwa khitaab kaa muqabla hoga,''management kii dohari vyavastha vijender ko alag-alag dishaao main to nahin khinch rahi? peshewar boxing kii sabase tajurbekaar awaajon main se ek warren par bharosa karnaa vaazib he, jab ve kehete hai, "vijender ke hunar kaa darja bahut ooncha he
 He has long experience at the amateur level
 hindustan main ve superstar hai
 i would love to see them become champions
 '' hindustan main boxing ke diwane bhi yahi ummid karenge, bhale yah hamaari ummid se thodi deree se ho rahaa ho

 In the first ODI century, the batsman Chapman scored an unbeaten 124 runs with the help of two sixes and 11 fours in 116 balls
 is tarah se unhone us vishisht club main apana naam likhvaya jisamen denis amis, desmund hens, endi flower, saleem ilaahi, martin guptil, colin ingram, rob nichol, philip huge or maaikel lamb shaamil hai
 Chapman also became the first batsman to score a century in odis for Hong Kong
 unka 124 ran kaa score debyue vanade match main hens ke 148 ran ke baad doosraa sabase bada score he
 With the help of this young batsman's century, Hong Kong scored 298 runs for four wickets in the prescribed 50 overs, batting first

 asia cap ke pehle match main team india ne bangladesh par 6 wicket se jeet darj kii or ek baar phir is jeet main sabase bada kirdaar viraat kohli ne nibhaayaa
 In this innings, Virat Kohli scored a brilliant century while playing the captaincy innings
 bangladesh ke khilaaf kohli kaa yah teesraa shatak he
 This is Virat's 19th century in odis
 iske saath hi kohli ne vanade maichon main shatak ke maamle main bryan lara kii barabari kar lee he
 The special thing is that this is only 131st ODI of Virat Kohli whereas Lara has played 299 odis
 ab shatakon ke maamle main unase aage keval 7 diggaj cricketer hai
 Virat Kohli made another record with this
 wo ab duniya ke sabase tej 19 vanade shatak lagane vaale cricketer bhi ban gaye hai
 He has demolished Chris Gayle's record
 gail ne 189veen pari main apana 19waan shatak banaaya tha
 Sachin Tendulkar holds the record for most centuries in odis
 sachin ne vanade main 49 shatak lagaaye hai
 He is followed by Ponting with 30 centuries at number two, Jayasuriya with 28 centuries at third
 iske baad jo teen shatakaveer hai unhen pachhaadne main kohli ko keval kuch maichon kii jarurat hogi kyonki saurav ganguli (22 shatak), kris gail or harshal gibs (21 shatak) or said anwar (20 shatak) unase mahaj kuch kadamon ke faasale par record book main darj hai
 This is Kohli's only 8th match as captain and he has scored a century in three of these
 kohli ne captain ne taur par isse pehle zimbabwe (115) or west indies (102) ke khilaaf abhi pichley saal hi shatak lagaaya tha
 Let us tell you that Kohli is one of the few cricket captains to have a record of scoring a century in his first match as a captain
 duusari pari main ballebaaji karte hue yah kohli kii 13veen centuri he
 And one special thing, except for just two occasions, whenever Kohli has scored a century in odis, then Team India has won
 yani unke 17 shatak team india ke liye jeet lekar aae
 Virat Kohli has played 8 matches as captain so far and Team India has won in all these odis
 yani sau fisadi safalataa
 So Virat Kohli, who is seen as the future captain of Team India, is definitely making his move in this direction very fast
 match dar match kohli or bhi viraat hote ja rahe hai
 And most importantly, it is also his first official tournament as a captain

 Because this may pose a risk of the world economy sinking into recession for the second time
 vaishvik protsaahan package ko adhik nape tule dhang se waapas lene kii vakaalat karte hue pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne ji-20 shikhar sammelan main kaha ki duniya ke mandi se ubarne kii prakriya abhi bhi kaaphi kamjor he or isiilie is prakriya ko majboot karne par vishesh dhyaan dene kii jarurat he or sarkari karj kii samasya se nipatane ke liye saavdhaanee se kadam uthaane chahie
 The Economist Prime Minister appealed to avoid new protectionist measures in industrialized countries and to remove existing barriers to trade, especially those affecting developing countries
 duniya ke mandi se ubarne ke liye protsaahan package ko kab or kaise hataaya jaae, is bare main abhi ji-20 deshon main sahmati nahin he
 There was a general consensus on the promotion of last year's summit in London
 euro kshetra ke kuch deshon main sarkari karj kii gambhir samasya ke kaaran britain, france or germany jaise desh protsaahan package ko jald samaapt karnaa chaahate hai taaki sarkaron kaa ghaataa kam kiya ja sake lekin bharat or america jaise desh nape tule dhang se ise waapas lene ke pakshdhar hai
 There has also been no consensus on the proposal to impose banking tax globally for the purpose of raising funds for the banks to overcome the crisis
 is prastaav kaa bharat ne virodh kiya he
 By the way, Britain has already imposed such a tax on itself, while France and Germany are also in the process of doing so

 This is particularly the case in many European countries
 unhone kaha ki halaat saamaanya nahin hai or vishwa arthvyavastha ke mandi se ubarne kii prakriya ab bhi najuk daur main he or audyogic deshon main nijee maang main giravat se dobaaraa mandi kii sthiti paidaa ho sakati he
 Manmohan's speech at the conference was carefully listened to by many world leaders including US President Barack Obama, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, UK Prime Minister David Cameron and Chinese President Hu Chintao

 This comment of the Prime Minister is important in the context of the European countries taking more caution than expected
 europe ke deshon ne apane saarvajanik kharch ke bajet main katautee shuru kar di he kyonki unhen ashanka he ki sarkari karj bad saktaa he
 Countries such as France and Germany are insisting on levying taxes with the aim of raising the necessary funds for banks to overcome the crisis
 udhar america abhi bhi paryaapt sankhya main rojgaar ke avasar srujit nahin kar paaya he

 These packages were given to deal with the financial crisis of 2008
 unhone duniya ke netaaon ko samajhaayaa ki bharat maujuuda aarthik halaat se kaise nipat rahaa he

 kisi bhi rishte main mahila or purush donon ko ek duusare kii taraf aakarshith hona jaruri hota he
 It is often said that the most attractiveness of girls and their dressing style attracts men the most
 lekin kya aapane kabhi ye jaanane kii koshish kii he ki ladkiyaan ladakon kii kis baat se sabase zyada impress hoti hai? aaie jaane
 
 aise karen ladakiyon ko impress- aap kya karne vaale hai yaa kya karnaa chaahate hai isaki jaankaree ladki ko naa den
 Rather, surprise them from time to time
 aise wo aapaki taraf khud ko zyada aakarshith mahasoos karengi
 Let some things remain suspense between you and your partner
 isse unke jivan main aapaki ahmiyat bani rahegi
 Do these 3 things for your partner - girls like courageous boys very much
 har ladki chaahati he ki uskaa partner confident or saahsee ho
 So that he can protect it from the world when needed
 isliye agar kabhi aapako kisi baat par dar kaa ehsaas ho to apane chehre par dar ke bhav ko na aane den
 Try to keep your emotions under control
 aisa karne se aap ladakiyon ko zyada atrective or confident lagenge
 According to Psychology, people are often more attracted towards the same thing which is difficult to get
 chaahe koi shaks ho yaa koi cheez
 So if you also want to attract someone towards you, then keep a distance
 jaane, partner ko pehali baar 'ai lav you' kab bolnaa chahie?- pehali mulaakaat main kisi ko bhi apane bare main zyada jaankaree dene se bachein
 If you want to share something, tell a little
 aap pehali hi meeting main sab kuch bataa denge to ladakiyon kaa interest aapmen kam hone lagegaa
 - Often girls try to read boys' facial expressions to know and understand them
 kisi ko khud ko padhane na den ki aapke man main kya chal rahaa he yaa aap kya soch rahe hai
 Be a mystery man by seven of your partners
 isse wo aapaki taraf zyada aakarshith hongi
 - Girls like funny boys very much

 da taashkand files, film main role, shastri ji kii maut, modi se apeksha, shastreey sangeet, kariyar jaise masalon par abhinetri shweta basu prasad ke saath baat keenavin kumaranelambe samay ke baad ek vivaadaaspad vishay vaali film main kaam karne kaa faisla kyon?da taashkand files kii script mujhe bahut pasand ai
 It is based on the death of our former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri
 unki maut aaj bhi 53 saal baad rahasyamay bani hui he
 Like me, today's youth also wants this secret to be exposed
 to kya yah film us rahasy par se paradaa uthaati he?iske liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Will make you think
 yah ek invastegative thriller film he
 What role are you playing in the film? i am playing the role of today's journalist Ragini Phule who prints a report where the post mortem report of Shastri's death is
 iske baad hangaamaa hota he or ek jaanch ayog baithta he
 How much do you agree with the question of killing Shastriji? The question is not who murdered Shastriji
 sawaal yah he ki unki maut kaise hui
 The situation in which he was brought was very mysterious at Palampur Airport
 unka cheharaa nila tha, mujhe to nahin lagata he ki wo natural deth thi
 If there was a heart attack, give a post-mortem report
 shastri ji ke parivaaravale kya chaahate hai?wo bhi asaliyat jaananaa chaahate hai
 The film also stars Sunil Shastri and Anil Shastri
 shastri ji maut par kya pradhanmantri narendra modi se aapaki koi apeksha he?agar modi ji film dekhakar shastri ji kii maut par jaanch ayog gathit kar den to film banane kaa hamaara makasad puraa ho jayega
 After journalism did you not feel like working in that direction? After graduating from journalism, i did not act but worked behind the camera for four-five years
 shastreey sangeet kam lokapriy kyon he is vishay ko lekar maine ek dacumentary roots banaai jisamen pandit jasraj, eaar rahamaan, vishaal bharadwaj, hariprasad chaurasiyaaji, amjad ali khan sabakaa maine intervyuu liya
 You can watch it on Netflix now
 mujhe lagata he ki ajukeshan system main clasik mujic ko tarjeeh di jaani chahie
 By the way, if i had not returned to the world of acting again, i might have gone out to make a documentary for BBC or Discovery
 bataur bal kalakaar neshnal award lene ke baad kariyar ko lekar koi galati hui?bilkul nahin
 Living in the world of acting, i would also regret that i missed my childhood, i missed my studies
 kai saare child actor hai jinako afsos hota he ki unka bachapan chhin gaya he

 (also input from news agency language) pradhanmantri narendra modi par tikhaa hamalaa bolte hue maharashtra navnirmaan sena (manase) ke adhyaksh raaj thakare ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki 'pradhan sevak' shabd sabase pehle desh ke pratham pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru ne diya tha
 MNS chief Raj Thackeray also taunted PM Modi saying that you kept abusing Nehru and Indira Gandhi, but you still copy them

 Alcohol was thinking that she would survive because everyone is focused on meat
 jabaki afat us par bhi ai hui thi
 The flesh tricked
 upi main ghir gaya to north east pahunch gaya, phir kerala chalaa gaya
 Alcohol got stuck
 rashtriya rajmarg yani neshnal hive or rajkeey rajmarg yani state hive ke 500 meter idhar-udhar ab koi sharaab kii dukaan nahin hua karegi
 The order is of the Supreme Court
 aap media kaa kawarej dekhiye
 The coverage of meat emphasizes legalizing the illegal
 license lenaa hoga varna police or sarkaar ke dam par uchhalane vaali bheed hamalaa kar degi
 At the time of alcoholism, it is not so strong that the Supreme Court should follow as it is said
 sharaab se paryaton, rajasav or rojgaar ke sawaal ko pramukhataa se joda gaya
 Legitimate and illegal gained prominence during slaughterhouses and meats
 ham kuch akhabaaron kii surkhiyaan ke namoonay pesh karnaa chaahate hai taaki aap dekh saken ki meet or boojadkhaanon ke samay media kii bhashaa or manshaa kya thi
 - Yogi in action, people happy, locks on illegal slaughterhouses - bina license ke chal rahi meet factory prashasan ne sil kii - Three illegal slaughterhouses operated in the city - avaidh boojadkhana band karaane kaa abhiyaan shuru - Unannounced ban on animal harvesting in the district - karrwai ke virodh main hadtaal par meet vyapaaree - Action on slaughterhouses in UP, know the difference between legitimate illegal - angrezi akhbaaron kii surkhiyaan is tarah thim - 17 rules UP meat sellers must follow - how up's meat business was run before Yogi Adityanath cracked the whip - This Is How The Slaughterhouse Ban In Uttar Pradesh Will Cripple Revenue, Cost Millions Of Jobs boojadkhaanon or meet murga kii dukaanon par chhapamari police hi nahin kar rahi thi, kuch log bhi kar rahe the jo khud ko sarkaar ke swanyasevak samaj rahe the
 Who lit the meat shops? gaumance or maance ko ek hi qatari main bitha diya gaya jabaki upi main 1950 ke dashak se hi gaumance yaa gau hatya pratibandhit he
 The state government shouted that its decision is not towards any particular community
 jiske paas license he unhen chintaa karne kii zarurat nahin he
 Slaughterhouses were declared illegal, but was it told what was being cut there
 bakra, bhens yaa gaay
 Instead, this difference was presented to everyone as if the illegal slaughterhouse meant the beef business there
 ye media kii bhashaa kaa tone tha
 The tone is what is being spoken out loud, the undertones are what is being spoken
 rashtriya or rajkeey rajmargon se sate 500 ke meter ke daayre main sharaab kii dukaanon ko hataane ke aadesh main media ne kis paksh ko ubhaara
 State governments are giving relief by changing the status of highways
 haive ko nagarpalika ke daayre main laayaa ja rahaa he
 Then what will be the meaning of this decision
 media ke kawarej main sharaab kii band dukaanon ko aise dikhaaya gaya jaise global arthvyavastha kaa ghar ujaad gaya ho
 In the language of the reporter to the anchor, these shops showed sympathy, the strength of loss of employment and business was more strongly highlighted
 dikhaaya gaya ki kis tarah se freedom of chwis par hamalaa hua he
 You will not find the color of the community in its tone undertones
 isliye sharaab kaarobaari puure aatmavishvaas ke saath apni baat media ke saamne rakh sake
 In the entire coverage, you will see the side of road accident either missing or weak
 media kitni jaldi sharaab kii dukaanon ke prati sahanubhuti rakhane laga khaskar angrezi media
 His headlines stayed like this
 
 
 - HOW MUMBAI COPED WITH LIQUOR BAN ALONG HIGHWAYS - SC highway booze ban causes long lines, short tempers - Highway liquor ban: 5,000 people may lose jobs in Chandigarh - sc's highway liquor ban is disastrous, will kill hospitality sector, hit one million jobs - Liquor ban along highways: How court orders leave state coffers dry - Shrinking exchequers is what state governments are most worried about - SC highway booze ban causes long lines, short tempers The media was giving lectures to meat shoppers to be legalized, forgot to give lectures to liquor shops that the Supreme Court order is to follow
 wo log bhi gaayab ho gaye jo upi main gum gum kar meet kii dukaanon kaa license check rahe the, unhen vaid bana rahe the
 Now come on the issue of liquor traders
 ve vaaki supreme court ke aadesh se funs gaye hai
 Suddenly, there is a danger of closing shops in front of them, which were opened only with the license from the government
 par sochiye inaki baton ko media kitni sahanubhuti se dikhaa rahaa he, vahi media ko sadak durghatana ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaata he
 Can you know the story of meat meat sellers on the sidewalk in meat shops, whose shops have been removed
 unki bhi to rozi roti chhin gai he
 The hotel does not have a bottle to keep in the pocket and go somewhere else
 das lakh logon ke isse jude hone kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 a turnover of 2 lakh crores is being reported
 supreme court ke faisle se haive se sate hazaron baar, pub, dukaanon par asar to padegaa hi
 Jobs will go
 yah adaalat nahin sochegi, sarkaar nahin sochegi to koun sochega
 Why the Supreme Court gave such a decision
 yah bhi sochna hoga
 Twenty-five percent of those who die from road accidents are killed due to driving due to intoxication
 har saal sharaab ke kaaran hone vaali durghatana se 6000 se adhik log maare jate hai
 Can any court keep looking at this? ek faisle se ek jatke main jitne logon kii jaane nahin bachiin usase kahin zyaada ke rojgaar par sankat aa gaya he
 Will nothing be restrained by the order of the Supreme Court
 kyon sarkaron ne hive ke kinare sharaab kii dukaane kholin
 Governments should be punished, shopkeepers got tippaniyan Anchors are showing the benefits of red wine, such as meat does not provide protein
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne centre sarkaar ko chunauti di he ki wo sharabbandi lagu karke dikhaaye
 Ban liquor in BJP ruled states
 hamaari raajnneeti bhi sharaab ke peeche padi he
 In fact, the tire of our modernity and politics has been punctured
 uski gaadi funs gai he
 Road and Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari's statement in the Lok Sabha is that 'five lakh road accidents happen every year in India
 iske kaaran har saal dedh lakh log maare jate hai, isse salanaa 55000 karod kaa nuksaan hota he
 This amount is three percent of GDP
 ' On 18 March 2014, the Chief Justice of the Punjab Haryana High Court ruled that open liquor shops should not be seen along the highway and the access road to them should be closed
 to supreme court se pehle hai court ne aisa faisla diya tha
 The governments of Punjab and Haryana then moved to the Supreme Court
 nuksaan sadak durghatana se bhi he, supreme court ke faisle se bhi he
 - Yogi in action, people happy, locks on illegal slaughterhouses - bina license ke chal rahi meet factory prashasan ne sil kii - Three illegal slaughterhouses operated in the city - avaidh boojadkhana band karaane kaa abhiyaan shuru - Unannounced ban on animal harvesting in the district - karrwai ke virodh main hadtaal par meet vyapaaree - Action on slaughterhouses in UP, know the difference between legitimate illegal - angrezi akhbaaron kii surkhiyaan is tarah thim - 17 rules UP meat sellers must follow - how up's meat business was run before Yogi Adityanath cracked the whip - This Is How The Slaughterhouse Ban In Uttar Pradesh Will Cripple Revenue, Cost Millions Of Jobs boojadkhaanon or meet murga kii dukaanon par chhapamari police hi nahin kar rahi thi, kuch log bhi kar rahe the jo khud ko sarkaar ke swanyasevak samaj rahe the
 Who lit the meat shops? gaumance or maance ko ek hi qatari main bitha diya gaya jabaki upi main 1950 ke dashak se hi gaumance yaa gau hatya pratibandhit he
 The state government shouted that its decision is not towards any particular community
 jiske paas license he unhen chintaa karne kii zarurat nahin he
 Slaughterhouses were declared illegal, but was it told what was being cut there
 bakra, bhens yaa gaay
 Instead, this difference was presented to everyone as if the illegal slaughterhouse meant the beef business there
 ye media kii bhashaa kaa tone tha
 The tone is what is being spoken out loud, the undertones are what is being spoken
 rashtriya or rajkeey rajmargon se sate 500 ke meter ke daayre main sharaab kii dukaanon ko hataane ke aadesh main media ne kis paksh ko ubhaara
 State governments are giving relief by changing the status of highways
 haive ko nagarpalika ke daayre main laayaa ja rahaa he
 Then what will be the meaning of this decision
 media ke kawarej main sharaab kii band dukaanon ko aise dikhaaya gaya jaise global arthvyavastha kaa ghar ujaad gaya ho
 In the language of the reporter to the anchor, these shops showed sympathy, the strength of loss of employment and business was more strongly highlighted
 dikhaaya gaya ki kis tarah se freedom of chwis par hamalaa hua he
 You will not find the color of the community in its tone undertones
 isliye sharaab kaarobaari puure aatmavishvaas ke saath apni baat media ke saamne rakh sake
 In the entire coverage, you will see the side of road accident either missing or weak
 media kitni jaldi sharaab kii dukaanon ke prati sahanubhuti rakhane laga khaskar angrezi media
 His headlines stayed like this
 
 
 - HOW MUMBAI COPED WITH LIQUOR BAN ALONG HIGHWAYS - SC highway booze ban causes long lines, short tempers - Highway liquor ban: 5,000 people may lose jobs in Chandigarh - sc's highway liquor ban is disastrous, will kill hospitality sector, hit one million jobs - Liquor ban along highways: How court orders leave state coffers dry - Shrinking exchequers is what state governments are most worried about - SC highway booze ban causes long lines, short tempers The media was giving lectures to meat shoppers to be legalized, forgot to give lectures to liquor shops that the Supreme Court order is to follow

 Now come on the issue of liquor traders
 ve vaaki supreme court ke aadesh se funs gaye hai
 Suddenly, there is a danger of closing shops in front of them, which were opened only with the license from the government
 par sochiye inaki baton ko media kitni sahanubhuti se dikhaa rahaa he, vahi media ko sadak durghatana ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaata he
 Can you know the story of meat meat sellers on the sidewalk in meat shops, whose shops have been removed
 unki bhi to rozi roti chhin gai he
 The hotel does not have a bottle to keep in the pocket and go somewhere else
 das lakh logon ke isse jude hone kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 a turnover of 2 lakh crores is being reported
 supreme court ke faisle se haive se sate hazaron baar, pub, dukaanon par asar to padegaa hi
 Jobs will go
 yah adaalat nahin sochegi, sarkaar nahin sochegi to koun sochega
 Why the Supreme Court gave such a decision
 yah bhi sochna hoga
 Twenty-five percent of those who die from road accidents are killed due to driving due to intoxication
 har saal sharaab ke kaaran hone vaali durghatana se 6000 se adhik log maare jate hai
 Can any court keep looking at this? ek faisle se ek jatke main jitne logon kii jaane nahin bachiin usase kahin zyaada ke rojgaar par sankat aa gaya he
 Will nothing be restrained by the order of the Supreme Court
 kyon sarkaron ne hive ke kinare sharaab kii dukaane kholin
 Governments should be punished, shopkeepers got tippaniyan Anchors are showing the benefits of red wine, such as meat does not provide protein
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne centre sarkaar ko chunauti di he ki wo sharabbandi lagu karke dikhaaye
 Ban liquor in BJP ruled states
 hamaari raajnneeti bhi sharaab ke peeche padi he
 In fact, the tire of our modernity and politics has been punctured
 uski gaadi funs gai he
 Road and Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari's statement in the Lok Sabha is that 'five lakh road accidents happen every year in India
 iske kaaran har saal dedh lakh log maare jate hai, isse salanaa 55000 karod kaa nuksaan hota he
 This amount is three percent of GDP
 ' On 18 March 2014, the Chief Justice of the Punjab Haryana High Court ruled that open liquor shops should not be seen along the highway and the access road to them should be closed
 to supreme court se pehle hai court ne aisa faisla diya tha
 The governments of Punjab and Haryana then moved to the Supreme Court
 nuksaan sadak durghatana se bhi he, supreme court ke faisle se bhi he
 Not only was the police raiding the abattoirs and meat cock shops, some people were also doing what they considered themselves to be the government volunteers
 meet kii dukaane kisne jalaai aakhir
 Beef and meat have been arranged in the same line, whereas beef or cow slaughter has been prohibited in UP since the 1950s
 rajya sarkaar cheekhti rahi ki uskaa faisla kisi samudaay vishesh ke prati nahin he
 Those who have a license need not worry
 boojadkhaanon ko avaidh bataaya gaya magar kya yah bataaya gaya ki vahaan kya cat rahaa tha
 Goat, buffalo or cow
 bajaay is antar ke sabko aise pesh kiya gaya jaise avaidh boojadkhaane kaa matlab vahaan gaumance kaa kaarobaar ho rahaa ho
 This was the tone of the language of the media
 tone vah hua jo jor jor se bolaa ja rahaa he, andertone wo hua jo bina bole bolaa ja rahaa he
 Which side did the media highlight in order to remove liquor shops within a radius of 500 meters adjacent to national and state highways
 rajya sarkarein rajmargon kaa darja badalakar raahat de rahi hai
 The highway is being brought under the purview of the municipality
 phir is faisle kaa kya matlab rah jayega
 In the media coverage, the closed shops of liquor were shown as if the house of the global economy was destroyed
 reporter se lekar ankar kii bhashaa main in dukaanon ke prati sahanubhuti dikhi, rojgaar or kaarobaar ke nuksaan ke paksh ko zyaada majbooti se ubhaara gaya
 Shown how Freedom of Choice has been attacked
 iske tone andertone main aapako samudaay kaa rang nahin milegaa
 That is why the liquor businessman was able to present himself with confidence to the media
 puure kawarej main aapako sadak durghatana kaa paksh yaa to gaayab dikhegaa yaa kamazor dikhegaa
 How quickly did the media sympathize with liquor shops, especially the English media
 uske hedlins is tarah rahe

 inhen maangon ko lekar kisaanon ne rajasthan ke sikar main 1 sitambar 2017 se 13 sitambar 2017 tak andolan kiya
 This movement was so disciplined and non-violent that it also attracted people from the district and surrounding areas who had never joined the farmers' movement
 pyaaz moongfalee ke daam nahin mil rahe the, laagat bad gai thi
 The All India Kisan Sabha had created a movement in Sikar

 The specialty of Sikar's peasant movement was that auto driver union, private taxi union, ambulance, Ara machine union have also taken out a rally or supported the movement
 sabakaa kahana tha ki kisaan ke paas paise nahin hai to unke vyapaar par bhi asar padataa he
 Then the government came under pressure and agreed that loan up to 50,000 would be waived
 kisaanon ko 2000 rupee pension milegaa
 The government felt that the farmers had forgotten
 ab dobaaraa nahin lautenge lekin jab rajasthan sarkaar kaa bajet pesh hua tab saare kisaanon kaa lone maaf nahin hua
 The loan of 50,000 was waived only for the farmers who took loan from the cooperative society

 The government minister has said in the assembly that the losses of the farmers will be compensated
 beej companiyon se dhokhaa khaane par kisaanon ko bhi pataa nahin rahata ki kahaan jaaen, kya karen
 Even leaders who change their cloth and party day and night by taking their votes do not know that they should raise their voice in these matters
 aapako yaad hoga ki pichley saal maharashtra ke yavatmal main kitnashak se 21 kisaanon kii maut ho gai thi
 Nothing happens against companies
 isi 6 march ko krishi mantri ne loksabhaa main bataaya ki chaar saal main maharashtra main kitnashak se 272 kisaanon kii maut hui he
 This is the official data
 272 kisaan aise hi mar gaye, unki keemat hoti to netaa khud hi hangaamaa karte
 But have you seen leaders worrying? isiilie aap jitne bhi sankat main hon, hamaare desh ke netaa mouj main hai
 Now let's return to the farmers who came to Mumbai
 newalminute kii aparnaa kartikeyan ne ek acha lekh likhaa he ki jab kisaan kisi andolan main aate hai to peeche kitna nuksaan hota he
 This should also be seen about these farmers walking 30 to 35 km every day
 ham kai baar unke pradarshan kii laagat kaa dhyaan nahin rakhte hai
 This is the farmer who works on his own farm
 khet se ek din bhi dur rahanaa unke liye ghate kaa sauda he
 The agitators know that they will have to go back and starve for several days
 tamilnadu ke kisaanon ko andolan ke baad 20 hazaar se lekar 30,000 rupee tak kaa ghaataa hua
 Their animals also fall ill after the farmers
 dekhbhaal karne vaala koi nahin hota he
 Many farmers are agricultural laborers

 Will have to sleep hungry
 zaahir he sarkaar ko sochna chahie ki kab tak fasal kii laagat kaa dedh guna nahin denge, kab tak kisaanon ko pension nahin denge, aaj na kal dena hi hoga, behatar he de diya jaae
 The comments varna kisaan mumbai aae hai, kal dilli aane lagenge, apane apane rajyon kii rajdhaniyon main aane lagenge
 The leader of the Indian farmer union had called that they too are coming to Delhi

 Sugarcane dues should be paid immediately
 in maangon ko dekhakar yahi lagata he
 Either the Agriculture Minister does not do any work or he does so much work that even after that the problems do not end
 kisaan na to rajyasabha kaa tikat kareed sakate hai na loksabhaa kaa
 They can neither change parties nor change clothes
 nashik se mumbai tak kii padayatra kerani padati he
 In this journey of 180 km, the peasants must have lived their hardship again, again they will be able to give their voice and intent

 One and a half times the cost is not being received, announcement is being made, assurance is being given
 pension maang rahe hai mil nahin rahaa he
 They are not asking for market arrangements
 karz maafee maangate hai jiskaa elaan to hota he magar milti nahin he
 The result of the peaceful rally was that the government had accepted most of the demands
 30 june 2017 tak ke karz maaf honge
 You may remember that the debt waiver was announced on 24 June 2017 in Maharashtra
 dedh lakh tak ke krishi karz ke maaf kiye jane kaa elaan kiya gaya tha
 It was claimed that 89 lakh farmers would benefit
 rajya sarkaar ke khajaane par 34,000 karod kaa boj padegaa
 But people from the ground say that not everyone has received loan waiver yet
 ab ek nayaa elaan hua he ki 30 june 2017 tak ke karz maaf honge
 Following the banner of All India Kisan Mahasabha, these farmers have completed their journey and have re-impressed the government that they can return again if they forget the earlier promise
 dobaaraa bhul jane par tibaara laut sakate hai
 Today came to Mumbai on 9 March, with the movements discussed by the state government
 jo unki maangen thim unamem se kareeb kareeb sari maangen manzur kii thi
 More than 90 percent were landless tribals
 unki maang thi unhen van zamin kaa patta milanaa chahie, sarkaar ne pahal lekar aashwaasan kiya he ki chah maheene main aise saare daavon ko manzur karenge
 They will be given all the land allowed in the law
 is baat ko maanya kiya he
 On December 15, 2006, 11 years ago, the Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers legislation was passed
 hua yah tha ki jo adivasee sadiyon se apni zamin par rahe the, unhen atikaramanakari ke rup main dekha jane laga tha
 The tribals living in the forest did not have rights over their own land and forest
 forest afasar samajhataa tha ki vahi jangal kaa maalik he, adivasee nahin
 After passing 11 years ago, a large number of tribals got land leases under this law
 maharashtra ke adivasee kisaan sansad ke paas kiye gaye apane kanoon ke hisaab se haq maang rahe hai
 Land has been found in Gadchiroli and Nandurbar as of 2006, but not in other districts
 11 saal pehle paas hue is kanoon kaa yah ricard he ki do hi zile main kuch dhang se lagu hua he, baaki zilon main haal bahut acha nahin he
 Can the Maharashtra government get tribal farmers their rights within six months

 They did not have problems in the morning, so they came to Mumbai by night
 badale main mumbai waalon ne bhi kisaanon kaa koob khyaal rakhaa
 Some brought tea, some brought food and some brought chappals
 agar yah badlaav he to acha he
 How long farmers will be ignored
 neerav modi hazaron karod lekar bhaag jaataa he magar kisaan dedh lakh ke karj ke liye faansee chadh jaataa he
 In every budget you will hear that the loan amount for farmers will be 10 lakh crore this time
 kya wo raashi unhen milti he
 You know that in this budget, the target of agricultural credit has been increased to 11 lakh crore from the previous year's 10 lakh crore
 pi sainath ne bibisi hindi se kaha he ki naabard kii 2017 kii sambhavit link credit plan ke tahat jitna karz diya gaya he uskaa 53 pratishat hissaa mumbai or uske upnagaron ko diya gaya he
 While in Mumbai, you can understand who is a farmer
 in dinon bank series ke dauraan saikadon bankeron ne hamen bataaya he ki kisaan jab karz lene aata he to use majaboor kiya jaataa he ki vah fasal beemaa bhi le or duusari beemaa polisy bhi le
 The insurance premium often exceeds the interest on its loan
 ab yah baat kai prakaar kii report main aa chuki he ki kisaanon ko bataae bagair unke karz se beemaa kii premium raashi le lee ja rahi he
 Farmers are getting anxious
 dilli yaa rajyon kii rajdhani se kiye ja rahe ek-ek vaade or daawey par unki nazar he
 Therefore, when the price of potato was not received as promised in UP, farmers threw potatoes on the streets of Lucknow
 aapako yaad hoga pichley saal april maheene main tamilnadu ke kisaan aae the
 There was a severe drought in a hundred years
 in kisaanon ne media or sarkaar kaa dhyaan khinchne ke liye kya kya nahin kiya
 Put lentils and rice on the road and eat it
 nange badan ho gaye, gale main aatmahatya karne vaale kisaanon kaa narmund lataka liya
 Till funeral
 iske baad bhi kisi par kuch asar nahin padaa
 They came back again with the same demands that one and a half times the cost should be paid, pension and loan waiver
 100 dinon tak pradarshan karne ke baad ye dilli se chennai laut gaye
 You must be thinking that those farmers have disappeared
 lekin nahin
 These farmers are on a march from Kanyakumari in Chennai to Chennai
 raste main padane vaale gaanvon main jate hai, kisaanon se milte hai, unhen apane mudde ke bare main samajhaate hai taaki kisaanon main jaagrukta faile

 dilli ko khabar bhi nahin he
 These people stay in every district for three days
 abhi tak 4 zilon kaa daura kar chuke hai
 They will visit 32 districts of Tamil Nadu
 aapako yaad hoga pichley saal june ke maheene main 1 se 10 june tak kisaan madhya pradesh ke mandsaur main karz maafee or laagat kaa dedh guna hasil karne ke liye andolan kar rahe the
 We and you do not know about the recommendation of the Swaminathan Commission, but the farmer of India has come to know about the recommendation of the Swaminathan Commission
 aap laagat kaa dedh guna nahin dekar kisaanon ko bevakoof nahin bana sakate hai
 The great success of 2019 will be that the farmer will take one and a half times the cost

 Farmers will get a Rs 2000 pension

 Farmers' capital has sunk

 If they do not earn a day, then their family will not spend

 It is obvious that the government should think how long it will not pay one and a half times the cost of the crop, how long it will not give pension to the farmers, it has to be given today or tomorrow, it is better to give it
 tippaniyan Otherwise farmers have come to Mumbai, will start coming to Delhi tomorrow, will start coming to their respective state capitals

 Do they get that amount? aap jaanate hai ki is baar ke bajet main krishi rin kaa lakshya pichley saal ke 10 lakh karod se badhaakar 11 lakh karod kar diya gaya he
 p Sainath has told BBC Hindi that 53 per cent of the loan given under nabard's 2017 potential link credit plan has been given to Mumbai and its suburbs
 jabaki mumbai main koun kisaan he aap samaj sakate hai
 These days during the Bank Series, hundreds of bankers have told us that when a farmer comes to take a loan, he is forced to take crop insurance and other policies
 aksar beemaa kaa premium uske karz ke byaaz se zyaada ho jaataa he
 Now it has come in many types of reports that insurance premiums are being taken from their loans without telling the farmers
 kisaan besabr ho rahe hai
 He keeps an eye on every promise and claim being made from Delhi or the state capital
 isiilie jab upi main vaade ke hisaab se aalu ke daam nahin mili to kisaan lakhanu kii sadakon par aalu phenk aae
 You will remember that in April last year, farmers of Tamil Nadu came
 vahaan sau saal main sabase bheeshan sookhaa padaa tha
 What did these farmers not do to grab the attention of the media and the government
 sadak par daal chaaval rakhkar khaaya
 Naked body, hung the neck of farmers who committed suicide
 antim sanskaar tak kiya
 Even after this, nothing was affected
 ve dobaaraa aae unheen maangon ko lekar ki laagat kaa dedh guna daam mili, pension mili or karz maafee ho
 He returned from Chennai to Chennai after performing for 100 days
 aap soch rahe honge ki ve kisaan gaayab ho gaye hai
 But not
 ye kisaan tamilnadu ke kanyakumari se chennai tak ke march par hai
 Those on the way go to the villages, meet the farmers, explain to them about their issue so that awareness is spread among the farmers
 raste main hi sote hai
 These farmers have not given up yet
 1 march se 22 kisaan bas main savaar hokar tamilnadu ke gaanvon main gaye hai
 Delhi does not even have news
 ye log har zile main teen din tak rukate hai
 Have visited 4 districts so far
 ve tamilnadu ke 32 zilon main jaaenge
 You will remember that in the month of June last year, from 1 to 10 June, farmers were agitating in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh to get loan waiver and one and a half times the cost
 ham or aap swaminathan ayog kii sifarish ke bare main na jaane magar bharat kaa kisaan swaminathan ayog kii sifarish ke bare main jaan gaya he
 You cannot fool farmers by not giving one and a half times the cost
 2019 kii yahi badi kamyaabi hogi ki kisaan laagat kaa dedh guna le legaa
 The way he is returning after losing every battle, it seems from him that one day he will charge this price
 inhen maangon ko lekar kisaanon ne rajasthan ke sikar main 1 sitambar 2017 se 13 sitambar 2017 tak andolan kiya
 This movement was so disciplined and non-violent that it also attracted people from the district and surrounding areas who had never joined the farmers' movement
 pyaaz moongfalee ke daam nahin mil rahe the, laagat bad gai thi
 The All India Kisan Sabha had created a movement in Sikar
 sikar se sipiem ke do purv vidhayak amara ram or prema ram ise lead kar rahe hai
 The participation of women in this movement was more than men
 kisaan maang kar rahe the ki bachhadon kii bikri par roak hataai jaae
 Stray animals should be resolved and in 2017 the ban on the sale of animals should be withdrawn
 ye saath saal ke kisaan ke liye paanch hazaar kaa masik pension bhi maang rahe the
 The specialty of Sikar's peasant movement was that auto driver union, private taxi union, ambulance, Ara machine union have also taken out a rally or supported the movement
 sabakaa kahana tha ki kisaan ke paas paise nahin hai to unke vyapaar par bhi asar padataa he
 Then the government came under pressure and agreed that loan up to 50,000 would be waived
 kisaanon ko 2000 rupee pension milegaa
 The government felt that the farmers had forgotten
 ab dobaaraa nahin lautenge lekin jab rajasthan sarkaar kaa bajet pesh hua tab saare kisaanon kaa lone maaf nahin hua
 The loan of 50,000 was waived only for the farmers who took loan from the cooperative society
 lihaaza 22 farvari 2018 ko phir se sikar main andolan shuru hua or jaipur chalo kaa naaraa diya gaya
 From Sikar, Nagaur, Jhunjhunu and Kota, farmers started moving towards Jaipur
 inaki giraftaar hui magar sarkaar ko kisaan netaaon ko chhodana padaa
 The agreement was reached but the farmers are about to encircle their district headquarters again on 1 May
 jaipur main kisaanon ko nahin ghusane diya gaya to kisaanon ne tay kiya he ki ve in mantriyon ko gaanvon main nahin ghusane denge
 Farmers cultivating maize in many districts of Bihar are upset
 makke kii fasal main dana hi nahin aayaa he
 There is no grain in maize in many areas
 kisaanon kaa paisa kaaphi dub gaya he
 It is learned that they have been sold substandard seeds
 bihar kii media kii report ke anusaar 1732 acre main makke kii fasal main dana nahin aayaa he
 According to the news of Jagran and Prabhat Khabar, 500 acres of crop in Mokama was destroyed
 kisaanon kii puunji dub gai he
 Farmers bought hybrid seeds for good yield, for which the price paid was Rs 1500 per kg
 beej company ne daawa kiya tha ki ek bighas main 40 quintal makka ugega
 The farmers did not touch anything
 ek bighas main beej par hi kisaanon ke 6000 rupee lag gaye or barbaad ho gaye
 The government minister has said in the assembly that the losses of the farmers will be compensated
 beej companiyon se dhokhaa khaane par kisaanon ko bhi pataa nahin rahata ki kahaan jaaen, kya karen
 Even leaders who change their cloth and party day and night by taking their votes do not know that they should raise their voice in these matters
 aapako yaad hoga ki pichley saal maharashtra ke yavatmal main kitnashak se 21 kisaanon kii maut ho gai thi
 Nothing happens against companies
 isi 6 march ko krishi mantri ne loksabhaa main bataaya ki chaar saal main maharashtra main kitnashak se 272 kisaanon kii maut hui he
 This is the official data
 272 kisaan aise hi mar gaye, unki keemat hoti to netaa khud hi hangaamaa karte
 But have you seen leaders worrying? isiilie aap jitne bhi sankat main hon, hamaare desh ke netaa mouj main hai
 Now let's return to the farmers who came to Mumbai
 newalminute kii aparnaa kartikeyan ne ek acha lekh likhaa he ki jab kisaan kisi andolan main aate hai to peeche kitna nuksaan hota he
 This should also be seen about these farmers walking 30 to 35 km every day
 ham kai baar unke pradarshan kii laagat kaa dhyaan nahin rakhte hai
 This is the farmer who works on his own farm
 khet se ek din bhi dur rahanaa unke liye ghate kaa sauda he
 The agitators know that they will have to go back and starve for several days
 tamilnadu ke kisaanon ko andolan ke baad 20 hazaar se lekar 30,000 rupee tak kaa ghaataa hua
 Their animals also fall ill after the farmers
 dekhbhaal karne vaala koi nahin hota he
 Many farmers are agricultural laborers
 ve ek din nahin kamaayenge to unke parivaar kaa kharch nahin chalegaa
 Will have to sleep hungry
 zaahir he sarkaar ko sochna chahie ki kab tak fasal kii laagat kaa dedh guna nahin denge, kab tak kisaanon ko pension nahin denge, aaj na kal dena hi hoga, behatar he de diya jaae
 The comments varna kisaan mumbai aae hai, kal dilli aane lagenge, apane apane rajyon kii rajdhaniyon main aane lagenge
 The leader of the Indian farmer union had called that they too are coming to Delhi
 in kisaanon kii maang bhi maharashtra, tamilnadu, madhya pradesh ke kisaanon se alag nahin he
 One and a half times the cost
 pro ramesh chandra cameti kii report lagu ho
 National policy to rehabilitate families of farmers who committed suicide was made
 maujuuda beemaa policy kisaanon ke phaayde main nahin he
 Only the insurance company is benefiting from this
 kheti ko vishwa vyapaar sanghathan se baahar kiya jaae
 Sugarcane dues should be paid immediately
 in maangon ko dekhakar yahi lagata he
 Either the Agriculture Minister does not do any work or he does so much work that even after that the problems do not end
 kisaanon ne board ke parikshaarthiyon kaa khyaal rakhaa
 They did not have problems in the morning, so they came to Mumbai by night
 badale main mumbai waalon ne bhi kisaanon kaa koob khyaal rakhaa
 Some brought tea, some brought food and some brought chappals
 agar yah badlaav he to acha he
 How long farmers will be ignored
 neerav modi hazaron karod lekar bhaag jaataa he magar kisaan dedh lakh ke karj ke liye faansee chadh jaataa he
 In every budget you will hear that the loan amount for farmers will be 10 lakh crore this time
 kya wo raashi unhen milti he
 You know that in this budget, the target of agricultural credit has been increased to 11 lakh crore from the previous year's 10 lakh crore
 pi sainath ne bibisi hindi se kaha he ki naabard kii 2017 kii sambhavit link credit plan ke tahat jitna karz diya gaya he uskaa 53 pratishat hissaa mumbai or uske upnagaron ko diya gaya he
 While in Mumbai, you can understand who is a farmer
 in dinon bank series ke dauraan saikadon bankeron ne hamen bataaya he ki kisaan jab karz lene aata he to use majaboor kiya jaataa he ki vah fasal beemaa bhi le or duusari beemaa polisy bhi le
 The insurance premium often exceeds the interest on its loan
 ab yah baat kai prakaar kii report main aa chuki he ki kisaanon ko bataae bagair unke karz se beemaa kii premium raashi le lee ja rahi he
 Farmers are getting anxious
 dilli yaa rajyon kii rajdhani se kiye ja rahe ek-ek vaade or daawey par unki nazar he
 Therefore, when the price of potato was not received as promised in UP, farmers threw potatoes on the streets of Lucknow
 aapako yaad hoga pichley saal april maheene main tamilnadu ke kisaan aae the
 There was a severe drought in a hundred years
 in kisaanon ne media or sarkaar kaa dhyaan khinchne ke liye kya kya nahin kiya
 Put lentils and rice on the road and eat it
 nange badan ho gaye, gale main aatmahatya karne vaale kisaanon kaa narmund lataka liya
 Till funeral
 iske baad bhi kisi par kuch asar nahin padaa
 They came back again with the same demands that one and a half times the cost should be paid, pension and loan waiver
 100 dinon tak pradarshan karne ke baad ye dilli se chennai laut gaye
 You must be thinking that he has disappeared
 lekin nahin
 These farmers are on a march from Kanyakumari in Chennai to Chennai
 raste main padane vaale gaanvon main jate hai, kisaanon se milte hai, unhen apane mudde ke bare main samajhaate hai taaki kisaanon main jaagrukta faile
 Slept on the way
 in kisaanon ne abhi himmat nahin haari he
 Since March 1, 22 farmers have boarded a bus to villages in Tamil Nadu
 dilli ko khabar bhi nahin he
 These people stay in every district for three days
 abhi tak 4 zilon kaa daura kar chuke hai
 They will visit 32 districts of Tamil Nadu
 aapako yaad hoga pichley saal june ke maheene main 1 se 10 june tak kisaan madhya pradesh ke mandsaur main karz maafee or laagat kaa dedh guna hasil karne ke liye andolan kar rahe the
 We and you do not know about the recommendation of the Swaminathan Commission, but the farmer of India has come to know about the recommendation of the Swaminathan Commission
 aap laagat kaa dedh guna nahin dekar kisaanon ko bevakoof nahin bana sakate hai
 The great success of 2019 will be that the farmer will take one and a half times the cost
 jis tarah se wo har ladaai haarane ke baad laut rahaa he, usase yahi lagata he ki ek din vah yah daam le legaa
 With these demands, farmers agitated in Sikar, Rajasthan from 1 September 2017 to 13 September 2017
 yah andolan itnaa anushaasit tha or ahimsak tha ki isamen zile or aas-paas ke ve log bhi aa gaye jo kabhi kisaanon ke andolan main shariq nahin hue the
 Onions were not getting peanut prices, the cost went up
 akhil bhartiya kisaan sabha ne hi sikar main andolan taiyaar kiya tha
 Two former CPM mlas from Sikar, Amra Ram and Prema Ram are leading it
 is andolan main mahilaon kii bhagidaari purushon se zyaada thi
 Farmers were demanding that the ban on sale of calves be lifted
 aawaara pashuon kaa samaadhaan ho or 2017 main pashuon kii bikri par lagi pabandi kaa kanoon waapas hate
 They were also asking for a monthly pension of five thousand for a farmer of sixty years
 sikar ke kisaan andolan kii khubi yah thi ki isamen auto chaalak union, privet taxi union, ambulance vaale, aara mashin union ne bhi raily nikaali he yaa andolan ko samarthan diya he
 Everyone said that if the farmer does not have money, then his business is also affected
 tab sarkaar dabaav main ai or samjhauta kiya ki 50,000 tak kaa lone maaf hoga
 Farmers will get a Rs 2000 pension
 sarkaar ko laga ki kisaan bhul gaye
 Now we will not return again, but when the Rajasthan government budget was presented, the loan of all the farmers was not forgiven
 sirf sahakaarita sosayadi se lone lene vaale kisaanon kaa 50,000 kaa lone maaf hua
 Therefore, on 22 February 2018, the movement started again in Sikar and the slogan of Jaipur Chalo was given
 sikar, nagaur, jhunjhunu or kota se kisaan jaipur kii taraf badhane lage
 He was arrested but the government had to leave the peasant leaders
 samjhauta hua magar lagu hota nahin dekhakar kisaan phir se 1 may ko apane apane zila mukhyalayon kaa gheraav karne vaale hai
 If the farmers were not allowed to enter Jaipur, then the farmers have decided that they will not allow these ministers to enter the villages
 bihar ke kai zilon main makka kii kheti karne vaale kisaan pareshaan hai
 There is no grain in the maize crop
 kai ilaakon main makke main dana nahin aayaa he
 Farmers' money has sunk a lot
 pataa chal rahaa he ki unhen ghatiya beej bech diya gaya he
 According to Bihar's media report, 1732 acres of maize crops have not been covered
 jaagran or prabhaat khabar kii khabaron ke anusaar mokama main 500 acre main lagi fasal barbaad ho gai
 Farmers' capital has sunk
 kisaanon ne acchhee paidaavaar ke liye hibrid beej kharidi, jiske liye keemat chukaai 1500 rupee prati kilo
 The seed company claimed that 40 quintals of maize would be grown in one bigha
 kisaanon ko kuch haath nahin laga
 In a bigha, the farmers only spent 6000 rupees on the seed and wasted
 sarkaar ke mantri ne vidhansabha main kaha he ki kisaanon ke nuksaan kii bharpai kii jaaegi
 Farmers don't even know where to go and what to do if they are cheated by the seed companies
 unke vot lekar kapadaa or din raat party badalane vaale netaaon ko bhi pataa nahin rahata he ki ve in maamalon main awaz uthaaen
 You may remember that last year 21 farmers died of pesticides in Yavatmal, Maharashtra
 companiyon ke khilaaf kuch nahin hota he
 On March 6, the Agriculture Minister told the Lok Sabha that 272 farmers have died due to pesticides in Maharashtra in four years
 ye sarkari aankada he
 272 farmers died like this, if they were valued, the leaders themselves would have created a ruckus
 par kya aapane netaaon ko chintaa karte dekha he
 Therefore, whatever the crisis you are in, the leaders of our country are in fun
 ab waapas lautate hai mumbai aae kisaanon par
 Aparna Karthikeyan of newsmint has written a good article about how much damage is done when farmers come into any movement
 har din 30 se 35 kimi paidal chalane vaale in kisaanon ke bare main is tarah se bhi dekha janaa chahie
 Many times we do not take into account the cost of their performance
 ye wo kisaan he jo apane khet main khud kaam karte hai
 Staying away from the farm for a day is a loss for them
 andolankaaree jaanate hai ki waapas jaakar kai dinon tak bhookha rahanaa hoga
 Tamil Nadu farmers suffered losses ranging from Rs 20,000 to Rs 30,000 after the agitation
 kisaanon ke peeche unke jaanavar bhi biimaar pad jate hai
 There is no one to care for
 bahut se kisaan khetihar mazdoor hote hai
 If they do not earn a day, then their family will not spend
 bhukhe sona padegaa
 It is obvious that the government should think how long it will not pay one and a half times the cost of the crop, how long it will not give pension to the farmers, it has to be given today or tomorrow, it is better to give it
 tippaniyan Otherwise farmers have come to Mumbai, will start coming to Delhi tomorrow, will start coming to their respective state capitals
 bhartiya kisaan union ke netaa ne phone kiya tha ki ve bhi dilli aane vaale hai
 The demand of these farmers is also no different from the farmers of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh
 laagat kaa dedh guna diya jaae
 The report of Prof
 Ramesh Chandra Committee is applicable
 aatmahatya karne vaale kisaanon ke parijanon ke punarvaas kii rashtriya niti bane
 The existing insurance policy is not in the benefit of the farmers
 isse sirf beemaa company ko phayda ho rahaa he
 Farming should be excluded from the World Trade Organization
 ganne kaa bakaayaa bhugtan turant kiya jaae
 This is what is seen by seeing these demands
 yaa to krishi mantri log koi kaam nahin karte hai yaa phir ve itnaa kaam karte hai ki uske baad bhi samasyaayein khatm nahin hotin
 If it is a change then it is good
 kab tak kisaanon ko andekha kiya jayega
 Nirav Modi runs away with thousands of crores but the farmer hangs himself for a loan of one and a half lakh
 har bajet main aap sunate honge ki kisaanon ke liye karz kii raashi is baar 10 lakh karod hogi
 Do they get that amount? aap jaanate hai ki is baar ke bajet main krishi rin kaa lakshya pichley saal ke 10 lakh karod se badhaakar 11 lakh karod kar diya gaya he

 The government felt that the farmers had forgotten
 ab dobaaraa nahin lautenge lekin jab rajasthan sarkaar kaa bajet pesh hua tab saare kisaanon kaa lone maaf nahin hua
 The loan of 50,000 was waived only for the farmers who took loan from the cooperative society

 The great success of 2019 will be that the farmer will take one and a half times the cost

 With these demands, farmers agitated in Sikar, Rajasthan from 1 September 2017 to 13 September 2017

 Farmers will get a Rs 2000 pension
 sarkaar ko laga ki kisaan bhul gaye
 Now we will not return again, but when the Rajasthan government budget was presented, the loan of all the farmers was not forgiven
 sirf sahakaarita sosayadi se lone lene vaale kisaanon kaa 50,000 kaa lone maaf hua
 Therefore, on 22 February 2018, the movement started again in Sikar and the slogan of Jaipur Chalo was given

 He was arrested but the government had to leave the peasant leaders

 If the farmers were not allowed to enter Jaipur, then the farmers have decided that they will not allow these ministers to enter the villages
 bihar ke kai zilon main makka kii kheti karne vaale kisaan pareshaan hai
 There is no grain in the maize crop
 kai ilaakon main makke main dana nahin aayaa he
 Farmers' money has sunk a lot
 pataa chal rahaa he ki unhen ghatiya beej bech diya gaya he
 According to Bihar's media report, 1732 acres of maize crops have not been covered
 jaagran or prabhaat khabar kii khabaron ke anusaar mokama main 500 acre main lagi fasal barbaad ho gai
 Farmers' capital has sunk
 kisaanon ne acchhee paidaavaar ke liye hibrid beej kharidi, jiske liye keemat chukaai 1500 rupee prati kilo
 The seed company claimed that 40 quintals of maize would be grown in one bigha
 kisaanon ko kuch haath nahin laga
 In a bigha, the farmers only spent 6000 rupees on the seed and wasted
 sarkaar ke mantri ne vidhansabha main kaha he ki kisaanon ke nuksaan kii bharpai kii jaaegi
 Farmers don't even know where to go and what to do if they are cheated by the seed companies
 unke vot lekar kapadaa or din raat party badalane vaale netaaon ko bhi pataa nahin rahata he ki ve in maamalon main awaz uthaaen
 You may remember that last year 21 farmers died of pesticides in Yavatmal, Maharashtra
 companiyon ke khilaaf kuch nahin hota he
 On March 6, the Agriculture Minister told the Lok Sabha that 272 farmers have died due to pesticides in Maharashtra in four years
 ye sarkari aankada he
 272 farmers died like this, if they were valued, the leaders themselves would have created a ruckus
 par kya aapane netaaon ko chintaa karte dekha he
 Therefore, whatever the crisis you are in, the leaders of our country are in fun
 ab waapas lautate hai mumbai aae kisaanon par
 Aparna Karthikeyan of newsmint has written a good article about how much damage is done when farmers come into any movement
 har din 30 se 35 kimi paidal chalane vaale in kisaanon ke bare main is tarah se bhi dekha janaa chahie
 Many times we do not take into account the cost of their performance
 ye wo kisaan he jo apane khet main khud kaam karte hai
 Staying away from the farm for a day is a loss for them
 andolankaaree jaanate hai ki waapas jaakar kai dinon tak bhookha rahanaa hoga
 Tamil Nadu farmers suffered losses ranging from Rs 20,000 to Rs 30,000 after the agitation
 kisaanon ke peeche unke jaanavar bhi biimaar pad jate hai
 There is no one to care for
 bahut se kisaan khetihar mazdoor hote hai
 If they do not earn a day, then their family will not spend
 bhukhe sona padegaa
 It is obvious that the government should think how long it will not pay one and a half times the cost of the crop, how long it will not give pension to the farmers, it has to be given today or tomorrow, it is better to give it
 tippaniyan Otherwise farmers have come to Mumbai, will start coming to Delhi tomorrow, will start coming to their respective state capitals

 Excerpts: How did you get such a big entry in Bigg Boss? How many recommendations did you make for this? Leave as many words as you like, what was special about you that you liked them? You have to ask them why they called me
 vaise main bataa duun ki main desh se baahar malaysia main thi
 But i was in India for 15-20 days
 tabhi wild card entry ke liye mere paas phone aayaa
 
 
 (cut in the middle) Whoever called
 
 i am telling you
 
 You give me a chance to speak
 sawaal bhi aap karoge, jawaab bhi doge to aapane mujhe yahaan kyon bulaayaa?isliye bulaayaa ki aap acting acchhee karti hai
 (laughter) i am not acting
 main to majaa le rahi hum, kitna majaa aa rahaa he aapke saath
 You are very good and jolly
 aap yahaan khub hans rahi he, jabaki big bos ke ghar main aapke bare main kuch log aapako ladaaki to kuch budtameez kehete hai
 So was this all your fake form there? No — no it wasn't
 kya koi rate tay tha ki jitani zyada ladaai karengi, utane zyada paise milenge?lo kar lo baat, aap kisi baaten karaten hai
 You know which approach you take out
 aisa thode na hota he
 i am Dolly Bindra, an actress
 meraa kaam he abhinay karnaa
 If you call me on your show, what will you call? For entertainment
 manoranjan ke liye bulaayenge na? main koi saamaajik kaaryakarta to hum nahin ki muft main kaam karuungi
 Will you take the money? It just ends here
 haa, lekin unhone kya soch kar aapako bulaayaa tha?ab yah to ve jaane ki unhone mujhe kyon bulaayaa? main ek senior kalakaar hum
 Now you see what they showed
 haa, jo aapane 24 ghante kiya, vah to dikhaaya nahin, varanaa pataa nahin kya ho jaataa
 No, no, there is no such thing
 mere hisaab se, vahaan jane se pehle maine jo kuch dekha tha, vah sab vastav main vahaan hota he
 If there was anything else, i would have spoken first, because no one can stop my tongue, whatever happens
 mai hameshaa sachaai par chalati hum
 i do not just talk about the truth
 main jo bolti hum vah karti hum
 Respect it, respect it jeeyo or jeene do, tang na karo
 (sings a song) Love each other my country lovers
 vahaan prem kii baat karte-karte dhishum- dhishum shuru ho gai thi
 The people there had created such an environment for me, a single abla, where i was isolated
 vah ghar bada bhayankar he
 This show is the father of reality
 maine ise sweekaar kyon kiya, vah bhi aapako bataanaa changi
 Bigg Boss has been watching for so many years
 yah sho kaaphi manoranjanpurn lagata he
 Prabhu ji is the presenter here
 agar prabhu ji ko big bos ke ghar main bulaate hai to aapako ham hansate-khelte, pyaar se pesh aate dekhenge
 Will keep joking with people
 vahaan honge asli prabhu ji
 You said well that the reality is known by going there
 to doli bindra jo andar or baahar hai, vah ek hi thi na? yaa andar kuch or thi?nahin, nahin ek hi thi
 Actually, the situation had become something like this
 mujhe lagata he aap utani buree nahin hai, jitani vahaan dikhaai gai thim
 Or did you act there? No, i don't act
 filmon main bhi main apane hisaab se kaam karti hum
 i do not read scripts even in films
 big bos main aapkaa kairactor dikhaaya gaya he ki ek aurat baat-baat par jhgada karti he, harek se panga lene ko taiyaar he, jo ladaai kaa bahaanaa dhundhati rahati he
 He gave you a script for this? i do not want to talk to you about it because there is no importance of this thing
 yah ek reality sho he
 i went to experience that if i stayed there, i could survive anywhere in life
 ek phone ke bagaiyr, ek newspaper ke bagaiyr
 Your daily lifestyle is not there
 aap hameshaa camere kii nigaah main hote hai
 But i did not understand why people think me so wrong
 main focus main zyada ai
 Yes, why did i come? i was surprised when i saw the clipping
 mujhe bada dukh hua
 Shweta Tiwari was fighting like Khali wrestling wrestlers
 main jab se vahaan gai tab se shweta main asuraksha kii bhaavana baith gai
 Everybody turned against me
 main puri tarah akeli ho gai thi
 i would definitely say that living in this house is a different experience
 is par bhi vahi kahawat lagu hoti he ki shaadi kare to pachhataaye, na kare to bhi pachhataaye
 But experience must be taken
 vahaan main kai baar kaabo se baahar hui hum
 You went inside to win, don't you? i tell you the truth that i went to have fun, not to win
 jeetne kaa koi makasad nahin tha
 Bigg Boss house has people from different social and economic backgrounds
 kuch amir gharon ke hai, to kuch garib
 Do you think that because of this certain types of people form a group? i did not care who is like
 main to mehmaan ban kar vahaan chali gai
 If the people there do not like my nature then it is not my fault
 unako meraa khaanaa pasand aayaa to vah sab thik tha
 It was fine when i used to laugh
 lekin jab unki galat baton par kuch boluun to vah thik nahin tha
 Then why did you get fired? See the rules and regulations are their own
 kya aapke galat vyavhaar kii vajah se?unhen jo thik laga, vah unhone kiya
 i did what i thought was right
 kya unka faisla jaij tha?mujhe koi gilaa-shikawa nahin he
 i am not sorry why i was fired
 aapane vahaan kya siikhaa? ladaai kam karne kii kala sikhi yaa nahin?maine siikhaa ki dost na banaao, logon se pyaar-mohabbat na karo
 But in Big Boss, people were falling in love
 ashleelata kar rahe the
 i mean love between one human being and another human being
 big bos main aap chaar hafte raheen, kya aapako laga ki vahaan log asli hai?sirf ek sachcha he, baaki to sab nakli he
 Only Khali is true, everything else is fake
 ashleelata ke kaaran big bos sho ko raat 11 baje dikhaae jane kii baat kii ja rahi he
 People cross the line of decorum
 aapane bhi kai baar jis bhashaa kaa prayog kiya
 
 
 Yes, that was my fault
 main to andar thi, par aapane baahar kya ashleelata dekhi, main vah jaananaa chaahuungi
 Got someone married there, which was already done
 shaadi to hui thi vahaan par, usamen mujhe bhi shaamil hona padaa
 Does this show contain pornography or not? You tell me something straight
 iskaa jawaab sho kaa nirmaataa endimaal batayega
 This is a reality show
 isamen logon ko reality dekhne dijie
 Is there a possibility of a wild card entry for you? Don't know, you may be saying that
 jab aap tamaasha karti thim to tiarapy acchhee hoti thi
 i cannot tell about it
 vahaan aapako ghar kaa kaam bhi karnaa padataa tha
 Work also has to be done at home
 ghar main kaam karne vaali baaiyaan ek din aati hai to duusare din gaayab ho jaati hai

 In the boat of Yuvraj Singh's charisma that has caught millions of cricket lovers, India on Thursday thrashed Australia by five wickets in the second quarter finals of the World Cup and laid the foundation for an exciting, interesting and tough match with Pakistan in the semi-finals
 yuvaraj is vishwa cap main teesri baar team ke taaranhar bane
 This time with his unmatched performance, India reached the distance of two matches after becoming the world champion after 27 years, while Ricky Ponting's dream of completing a hat-trick of titles as captain was shattered
 bharat ko pichley maichon kii tulana main behatar gendbaaji karne kaa bhi inaam mila kyonki australia lig charan main keval 102 ran banane vaale ponting kii 104 ran kii ranneetik pari ke baavjood chah wicket par 260 ran hi bana paaya jo motera ke sardaar patel stadium kii sapaat pich par bada lakshya nahin tha
 Despite Sachin Tendulkar's 53 and Gautam Gambhir's 50, when the Indian score was 187 for five, the two teams seemed to have an equalizer on the match
 austrailian pari main das over main 44 ran dekar do wicket lene vaale yuvaraj haalanki donon tiimon ke bich antar paidaa kar gayi
 He scored an unbeaten 57 off 65 balls with eight fours and a 74-run unbroken partnership with Suresh Raina (34 not out) to help 1983 champions India 47
 4 over main paanch wicket par 261 ran banaae
 The eyes will now be on Mohali on March 30, where the final will be played before the final as the competition will be between the two arch rivals India and Pakistan
 pakistan ne kal pehle quarter final main westeindies ko das wicket se ronda tha
 India reached the semifinals for the fifth time after 1983, 1987, 1996 and 2003
 yah bhi sanyog he ki 1983 main bharat ne hi tab do baar ke champion westeindies kaa khitaabi abhiyaan roka tha jabaki ab bhartiya team ne hi australia ko bairang swadesh lautne ke liye majaboor kiya
 Virender Sehwag (15 off 22 balls), who recovered from a knee injury, looked uncomfortable from the start
 unke khilaaf betr lee ke pehle over main hi wicket ke peeche kaich ke australian refral ko ampire ne thukraa diya tha lekin duusare badlaav ke rup main aaye shen watasan kii uthati gend par vah squaire leg par kaich de baithe
 Then India's score was 44 runs
 tendulkar ne shuru se hi haaavee hokar khilne kii ranneeti apanaayi
 He also sent Mitchell Johnson and Watson balls across the boundary line after Shaun Tait hit two fours in the first over
 van de main 18,000 ran puure karne vaale tendulkar haalanki motera par shatakon kaa mahashatak puraa karne se pehle hi pavilion laut gayi
 Tait's goodlength ball kissed his bat and fell into Haddin's gloves
 unhone 68 gend kheli or saat chauke lagaaye
 Gambhir (50 runs) and Virat Kohli (24 runs off 33 balls) then tried to put pressure on Australia by taking one two runs
 donon ek do ran lekar acchhee tarah se pari aage badha rahe the lekin kohli ne david hassi kii phultas par galat shaat khelkar apana wicket inaam main de diya
 Yuvraj, running in excellent form, opened his account by hitting a four in the same over
 unhone apane pedal sweep kaa acha namoona pesh kiya lekin duusare chor par gambhir ardhashatak puraa karne ke baad apni galati se ran out ho gayi
 Yuvraj then stood in his place playing ball on Thirdman while Gambhir ran to the half pitch and thus his innings was limited to 64 balls which included two fours
 yuvaraj ne tait kii gend hawa main laharaakar chaar ran ke liye bheji or phir brett lee par third main or cover main chaukaa jadkar unka aatmavishvaas diga diya
 In an attempt to stop one of his shots, Lee was also injured, in the first over of the powerplay, Raina hit the first six of the innings
 yuvaraj ne lee par vijayi chaukaa jadkar darshakon ko madahosh kar diya
 Earlier in the Australian innings, Ponting played the anchor
 unhone is bich bread hadin :53: ke saath duusare wicket ke liye 70 or david hassi :naabad 34: ke saath chathe wicket ke liye 55 ran kii saajhedaari bhi kii
 Dhoni handed the new ball to his trumpet Aces Ashwin of Chennai Super Kings and he fully implemented the advice of coach Gary Kirsten by bowling Shane Watson (25) and putting pressure on Australia
 dhoni ne gendbaaji main lagaataar badlaav bhi kiye or yahaan tak ki tendulkar or kohli se bhi gendbaaji karavaayi
 Tendulkar took the ball for the first time since 2009 in One Day
 australia ke khilaaf acha pradarshan karne vaale harbhajan singh ko nauven over hi akraman par lagaaya gaya
 He gave 18 runs in six overs of the first spell but 32 runs were taken in the last four overs
 lekin ponting puri patibaddhta ke saath krij par utre the
 Ponting, who was the target of media due to poor form, then played an innings by playing the role of anchor while wickets were falling from the other end
 bich main jab vah apni pari ko pravaah dene ke mood main dikhe tab jahir jahir kii karishmai dhimi gend ne maaikel hassi kaa aaf stump ukhaad diya jisase unhen phir se sanbhalkar khelnaa padaa
 Ponting tried to spoil Yuvraj's bowling analysis by hitting a six and then a four over extra cover in the tenth over
 yuvaraj ne 44 ran dekar do wicket liye
 Zaheer, however, did not let the new batsman Cameron White (12) stay any longer and gave the bowler an easy catch
 australia ne 44wein over main ballebaaji powerple liya or in paanch overon main 44 ran banaaye
 Ponting, meanwhile, completed his 30th in One Day and his fifth century in the World Cup
 vah turant baad hi aswin par reverse shaat lagaakar short third main kshetra main kaich dekar pavilion laute

 The government told the Supreme Court on Thursday that the controversial first-come-first-served method for spectrum allocation was implemented in January 2001
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne sarkaar se yah sawaal kiya tha ki yah avadharana kab se apanaayi gayi
 This is the answer from the government
 tu-ji spectrum aavanton kii jaanch kar rahi agenciyon ke anusaar, pehle aao-pehle paao kii niti main 2-ji license or spectrum dilaane main kuch companiyon ko anya kii tulana main phayda pahunchane ke liye badlaav kiya gaya
 On behalf of the government, the spot attorney general Ghulam E
 Vahanvati informed the Supreme Court that this process, which came under the supervision of the apex court, was initiated by the Department of Telecommunications to allocate telecom licenses with the introduction of spectrum from the year 2001
 
 yah maamla salaah-mashvire ke liye kabhi bhi tri ko nahin bheja gaya
 Vahanvati told the bench, this issue related to first-come-first served was never referred to TRAI
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne ise sabase pehle 21 janvari 2001 ko mul seva pradaataaon ko doorsanchaar spectrum aavantit karne ke liye apanaaya tha
 The petitioners also stated that TRAI recommended the cancellation of 69 out of 122 licenses as they could not commence service within the stipulated time frame as per the license granting conditions
 isse pehle peeth ne 11 nijee doorsanchaar companiyon ko notice jari kiya tha jinhen kathith taur par ayogy hone ke baavjood license diya gaya tha yaa nishchit samay seemaa ke andar ve seva shuru karne main vifal rahe
 Private telecom companies to whom notices were issued include Etisalat Uninor, Loop Telecom, Videocon, s-tel, Allianz Infra, Idea Cellular, Tata Teleservices, Sistema Shyam Teleservices, Dishnet Wireless, vodafone-essar as well as TRAI
 tu ji aavanton ghotaale se phaayde main rahane vaali doorsanchaar companiyon ne spectrum aavanton main kisi tarah kii avaidhta se inkaar kiya or ucchtam nyaayalay se kaha ki agar raja ke kaarykaal main pehle aao pehle paao niti ko avaidh mana jaataa he to varsh 2003 se sabhi aavantnon ko nirast kiya jaye
 The court hearing in the case virtually took the form of a fight with older service providers who argued that the spectrum allocated to them is valid and should not be compared with new companies whose licenses are under judicial surveillance

 iske alaava yah un logon liye acchhee khabar he jo 26 / 11 ke hamale se peedit hai
 Congress spokesman Rashid Alvi said that there is a rule of law in India
 agar kasaab ko usee din goli maar di jaati to kisi ko koi pareshaani nahin hoti; par kasaab ko puraa mauka diya
 At last Kasab received the punishment for his crime
 yahaan kanoon kaa raaj he, par yahaan koi gunaah karegaa to use bakhsha nahin jayega
 BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said that terrorism is a conspiracy against the country which also includes external forces
 ham sarkaar se kahana chahenge ki tamaam un logon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kii jaae, jo desh main asthirataa laane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Those cases on which the charges are fully proved, even if the Supreme Court sentences them, those cases should not be delayed

 Eventually, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has started excavations at Baghpat district in western Uttar Pradesh, where local historians and people believe that the remains of the Mahabharata-era 'lakshgriha' are present here
 yah vahi 'laakshagrih' he jisese bachane ke liye pandavon ne ek surang kaa prayog kiya tha
 The ASI has started digging by setting up camp there for digging
 sthaneey itihaaskaaron kaa daawa he ki bagpat main barnava kshetra ke aasapaas 'lakshagrih' rahaa hoga
 Krishnakant Sharma, Associate Professor of the Department of History at Multani Mal Masters College in Modinagar, said, "the Kauravas built 'laxgriha' to kill the Pandavas
" lekin pandavon ne isse bachane ke liye paas ke ek surang kaa istemaal kiya
 Barnava's old name was Varnavat and is one of the 5 villages that the Pandavas sought from the Kauravas after the expulsion
 "unhone aage kaha, "kisi ne bhi is surang kii lambaai or kai mode hone ke kaaran is bare main zyada jaanch-padtaal karne kii koshish nahin kii
 But on the basis of centuries of belief and information of elders, this place has historical importance and can be excavated
 "eesai ke 2 athurities, nai dilli sthit red fort ke institute of orcyology or eesai kii khudaai team bagpat main ek camp lagane ja rahi he
 Jitendra Nath, Director, ASI (excavation), said, "2 ASI authorities will jointly carry out excavation work and have also been given a license to study the entire case
 " haalanki team ke sadasyon ne is maamle main dharmik drushtikon ke bare main kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kar diya
 The excavation work can last up to 3 months, and this time can be extended based on its progress
 institute ke chaatr bhi puri prakriya main shaamil rahenge
 Amit Rai, director of the Shahzad Rai Research Institute at Barut, who discovered a human skeleton wearing a crown of copper in Chandayan village in Baghpat in 2014, says some of the Mahabharata era paintings have been found in the area
 jo chijen mili hai wo 4,000 se 4,500 saal puraani hai
 The excavation under the Lakshagriha mound continued on Sunday, with trenches excavated on its upper part

 Team India Test captain Virat Kohliensidni Cricket Ground Paracenturi Judd
 yah shatak kai myanon main khaas he is centuri ke saath kohli ne world record to banaaya hi saath hi sabit kar diya ki ballebaaj ke saath captain ke taur par bhi paripakv ho rahe hai
 Seeing the way Kohli has batted in Sydney so far, it would not be wrong to say that he has made the move towards becoming 'captain Cool'
 viraat kohli ko khulaa khatkohali dhoni kii tarah kool andaaj main hi ballebaaji karte najar aae or unka over agreshan is pari main abhi tak nahin dikhaai diya
 The way Kohli is taking the shot, it seems that after Anushka Sharma and Mitchell Johnson, he is kissing the ball with his bat and sending it across the boundary line
 viraat kohli ne edilade test main captaini kii thi or lagaataar do pariyon main centuri thoki thi
 In the subsequent two matches, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni took command of the team, but after the Melbourne Test, Dhoni said goodbye to Test cricket and Kohli got the command of the Test team
 sidney test kii pehali pari main centuri thokate hue viraat kohli duniya ke pehle aise test captain ban gaye hai jisane captency debyue ke saath lagaataar teen pariyon main centuri thoki ho
 Apart from this, Virat has also made the record of scoring the most runs in a Test series in Australia
 isse pehle yah record rahul dravid ke naam tha
 Rahul Dravid scored 619 runs in the four Test matches series in the 2003 Test series
 viraat is record ko tod chuke hai or abhi bhi krij par date hue hai
 Kohli scored a fourth century in this four-match series with Australia
 isse pehle australia ke khilaaf ek siries main bharat kii ore se kisi bhi ballebaaj ne chaar shatak nahin lagaae the
 Sunil Gavaskar scored three centuries in 1977
 kohli ne ab tak 10 centuri thoki hai, jisamen se 6 australia ke khilaaf hai
 Apart from this, Virat has matched a record of Sunil Gavaskar
 sunil gavaskar ekmaatr bhartiya ballebaaj rahe hai, jinhone ek test siries main chaar shatak jade hai, ab viraat unke saath is list main top par pahunch gaye hai
 This is Virat's 10th century in Test cricket

 With this century of Virat, the century studded by the captains in this series has been 7, which is the first time in Test cricket

 Actor Dhanush, who has worked in South India cinema and Bollywood, is seen getting caught in controversies after his statement
 haal hi main ek press meeting ke dauraan dhanush ne actors kii fees ko lekar baat kahi thi
 He had said, in today's time, it has become very rare for actors to get full fees
 lekin meri film asuran main thanu sar ne meri selary shooting se pehle hi settle kar di he
 It has helped me a lot
 unke is bayaan par asuran ke produsar kalipulli thanu ne kaha ki dhanush ne apni filmon kii relies ke liye kai karod rupye bhi qurbaan kiye hai
 Although Dhanush did not name any producers, his statement was followed by Al Azhagappan and K
 rajan jaise filmmekars kaaphi khafa hai
 Azhagappan told a website, actors like Vijay and Ajit help the producers
 lekin jin logon ne dhanush kii filmon main paisa lagaaya, ve is bijness main fail ho chuke hai
 They have now disappeared from this field

 rajan ne kaha ki actors ko producers par aarope nahin lagaana chahie
 He said, 'many producers who worked with Dhanush have suffered heavily
 producers filmein privet lone lekar banaate hai
 Due to the mistakes of actors and directors, these producers often suffer tremendous losses
 jin filmon kaa bajet 10 karod he, unka market kai baar sirf 8 karod tak hota he
 K
 rajan ne kaha, dhanush jaise actors ke paas lagjri kaaren hai, lekin producers sadak par aa gaye hai
 Some actors feel that producers are making big bucks which is not true
 to actors ko producers par aarope lagaana band karnaa chahie
 China has once again threatened India
 china ne kaha he ki agar doklam se bharat ne apni sena nahin hataai to yuddh hokar rahegaa
 Not only this, China has called it the last warning
 china ke sarkari akhbaar global times ke sampadak ne video sandesh ke jariye ye chetavanee jari kii he
 He said that New Delhi is not preparing for the worst time
 saath hi unhone ye bhi kaha he ki suraksha agenciyaan pradhanmantri narendra modi ko sach nahin bataa rahi hai or unhen andhere main rakh rahi hai
 In this message, 'do not be foolish like Nehru', Global Times editor Hu Jijin also mentioned the 1962 war
 unhone kaha ''jo naadaani nehru ne 62 main kii thi, vahi bharat aaj kar rahaa he
 "for the first time, PM Modi's name has threatened war, taking the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the first time
" sarkari akhbaar global times ne kaha he bharat kii suraksha agenciyaan apni kshamtaaon ko lekar pradhanmantri narendra modi ko andhere main rakh rahi hai
 This is the whole message
 
 
 sarkari akhbaar global times ne kaha he ki bharat aaj bhi vahi naadaani kar rahaa he jo nehru ne 1962 main kii thi
 The newspaper has said directly that India's security agencies are keeping Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the dark about their capabilities
 nai dilli sabase bure kii taiyaari karne kii bajaay apane nagarikon se achche kii ummid karne kii sikh de rahaa he
 Is the Indian government like the church that is leading the prayer? If India continues to ignore China's warning, war will continue
 agar bharat kii suraksha agenciyaan narendra modi ko bahakaati raheen to yuddh ko taalna mushkil ho jayega
 This means that India has become so courageous that it does not listen to China's warning
 1962 main nehru ne yahi sochaa tha ki china hamalaa nahin karegaa
 India is equally foolish today
 gajab jigyaasu desh he bharat
 -hu Jijin Chief Editor, Global Times is disputed area between China and Bhutan Doklam is a disputed area between Doklamachin and Bhutan
 bharat or bhutan ise bhutani kshetra maanate hai
 The deadlock between Indian and Chinese soldiers started on 16 June in Doklam over road construction by the Chinese army
 doklam par swaamitv par koi faisla na hone kaa hawala dete hue bhartiya sainikon ne china ke sadak nirmaan kaary ko roak diya tha
 He said that it is illegal for India to send military officers into Chinese territory

 Anand Teltumbde would have lived a respectable life if he had been in another country
 kuch kitaaben pard rahe hote, kuch lekh likh rahe hote or is baat ke liye saraahe jate ki unhone apane samaaj main barabari kii ladaai main apana ahm yogadan diya he
 But in India, leaving studies and forgetting discussions, they are trying to avoid arrest
 pehle unke kilaaf hinsa bhadakaane kaa maamla darj kiya gaya, phir unke maovadi link khoje gaye, sidhe pradhanmantri kii hatya kii saazish se unhen jod diya gaya, adaalat ne raahat di to police ne isaki parvaah nahin kii, unhen giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Left on the rebuke of the High Court
 lekin anand teltumbade ab bhi niraapad nahin hai
 The courts can only help them to an extent
 satta chaahe to unke daman or utpeedan ke kai or tareeqe nikaal sakati he
 Policemen in India know how many legal ways to harass someone
 anand teltumbade akele nahin hai
 There are more people with him who are facing all these allegations
 kaha ja saktaa he ki jab aap satta ke pratirodh ke liye nikalate hai to uske nateezon ke liye bhi aapako taiyaar hona chahie
 There is no dearth of writers and poets across the world who have been tortured because of their ideas
 unhen peeta gaya, sangsar kiya gaya, jelon main daalaa gaya or faansee par bhi chadhaaya gaya
 Poet Benjamin Mollois, who opposed the apartheid policies of South Africa, was hanged in 1985
 uske teen saal baad bharat main aatankwaadiyon ne avatar singh pash ko goli maar di thi
 While Pash was the poet who fiercely resisted power
 1990 main iraq kii sarkaar ne patrkaar farazad bazof ko sazaaye maut di thi
 Interestingly, Farzad continued to write against Iran's revolution and he was well received in Iraq
 lekin jab kurg ilaake main ek rasinic hamale kii khabar chhapi to iraq sarkaar ne unako zimmedaar mana or unhen giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Many writers-poets and journalists from India were jailed during the Emergency
 haal main guzar gayi paak shaayara fahamida riyaj ko saat saal jalavatan rahanaa padaa
 During this period, he made India his home
 to satta ke haathon pratadit hone vaale lekhakon-bauddhikon kii suchi bahut lambii he
 Needless to say that his contribution is huge in the struggle in favor of democratic freedom and man's dignity
 lekin bharat main kisi lekhak yaa buddhijivi ke saamne ye halaat kyon aane chahie? azaadi kii ladaai main tapate hue bhartiya raashtra rajya ne apana ek man viksit kiya tha
 This understanding was very clear that India will maintain the freedom and dignity of its citizens, whatever the problems they face
 bhartiya loktantr main bolne kii jo azaadi he, vah isi soch or samaj kaa nateeja he
 The Emergency came as an exception to this rule, which Indira Gandhi had to suffer
 desh ke bauddhikon ko bhi yah baat samaj main ai ki apni azaadi banaae rakhane ke liye gaahe-bagaahe ladanaa or pitnaa pad saktaa he
 These days a lot of people, saddened by the criticism of the government, seem to raise the question whether in any other country - like China or Pakistan - can we speak with such independence? They forget that this freedom is not given by any government, the Indian public has earned and no one can compare it
 sach to yah he ki duniya ke kai loktantric deshon main press kii azaadi kaa str bharat se behatar he
 Nonetheless, return to Anand Teltumbde
 pichley dinon unki maarmik apil pard kar man karaab rahaa
 It seemed that the common citizen of this country is so helpless
 sarkarein chahen to use kitni aasaani se kuchal sakati hai
 It is possible that Anand Teltumbde should not be a very revolutionary or combative person like many of our peers are
 in panktiyon kaa lekhak bhi nahin he
 But his own life, bound by a variety of injustices, creates a natural resistance
 in anyaayon ke prati unki chetana unhen likhane or bolne ko majaboor karti he
 They find a group or organizational fight appropriate and necessary
 satta isi chetana se ghabraati he
 She considers people like Anand Teltumbde most dangerous
 kyonki ve bahut eemaandaaree se apni baat kehete hai or unki baat asar karti he
 But this is not just a matter of suppressing Anand Teltumbde, it is also an attempt to intimidate others - to tell them that if they speak against the power, they will have to face the punishment
 lekin chaahe darate-darate karen yaa phir nidar hokar, iskaa pratirodh to karnaa hoga
 Otherwise, we will have no value as a writer
 lekhak ko antat satta ke kilaaf or kamjor logon ke haq main khadaa hona hota he- yah samaj likhane waalon ko sadiyon se rahi he
 So some of this writer's scared, some suppressed voice should also be seen as an appeal in favor of Anand Teltumbde
 anand or un jaise lekhak niraapad rahen, padhane-likhane or pratirodh karne kii duniya main sahaj dhang se vicharan kar saken, isse hamaara bauddhik or rajnatik samaaj kuch samrudh hi hoga or ek desh ke taur par ham kuch majboot hi honge

 co / lpkvotei9f — Sushma Swaraj (@sushmaswaraj) July 10, 2016 Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ ek aisa smartphone he, jise aap kisi smartphone se bad kar yuj kar sakate hai
 There is a lot of potential
 ye note siries he or isamen die gaye s Pen main company ne is baar kai nae fitures aid kiye hai, jo groundbraking he
 The phone's display is excellent and at the moment you may not find smartphones with better display than this in the market
 is rivyuu main aap Galaxy Note 10+ ke bare main technicality se hat kar wo baaten padhenge, jo ek aam insaan kisi phone ko kharidne ke samay jaananaa chahta he
 Our review is for our readers, so that they can understand how the phone works in real life before buying the phone
 aapako kai rivyuu milenge, jinamein itani texicality dekhne ko milegi jise dekh kar aap apana sir pakad sakate hai
 However, here is the most reliable review - Samsung Galaxy Note 10+
 dizin or bild qualitysghaldy Note 10 Plus ko kuch samay ke liye maine primary phone kii tarah yuj kiya he
 The styles given in this phone i
e
 s Pen are really great
 air jescher ke jariye aap dur se hi apane phone ko kai tarah se control kar sakate hai
 s Pen can be used for swiping photos or activating the camera
 Galaxy Note 10 dizin or bild quality ke maamle main ipressive he
 The phone's display is quite large, the phone is powerful and the battery is also big, but still this phone is not heavy
 front main sirf screen or selfi camere ke liye panchhole milegaa
 Bezels are non-existent
 lekin thodaa chin jarur diya gaya he
 The Galaxy Note 10 has a solid body and justifies its price
 premium android smartphone main number-1 par ise rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Talking about the rear panel, the camera placement is good
 aaj kal companiyaan acha camera to detii hai, lekin camera placement kii vajah se puraa back dizin kharaab ho jaataa he
 This is not the case with the Galaxy Note 10
 camera placement sahi he or iske bagal main dual elidi flash he
 It is difficult to use the phone with one hand, because the display of the phone is very large and it is also the specialty of the Note series
 Galaxy Note 10 Plus kii disple 6
 There is an 8-inch AMOLED
 screen HDR10+ rated he
 In real life, you will like this display a lot
 kaaphi pehle se premium smartphone main samsung ke disple kaa jawaab nahin he
 Talk about bright, colorful, fluid - or viewing angle, this display affects in every way
 gaming, videos, photose yaa phir videography har maamle main iske disple main aapako real colors dikhte hai
 If you run this OLED panel in Vivid mode, then obviously you will get better results
 iphone XS Max ke mukaable mujhe Note 10+ kii screen zyada behatar lagi
 Galaxy Note 10 Plus Camera performancethis smartphone has four rear cameras
 teen ek modul main hai or chauthaa camera flash ke bich main he
 One of these is wide angle lens and this time the company has also given ultra wide camera
 wide angal camera kamaal kaa he
 a lot of things come together in the frame, all things are covered
 ultra wide ke maamle main company ne kaaphi behatar kaam kiya he, lekin overol camera experience kii baat karen to isse jitani ummid thi us par khara nahin utarataa he
 It is not that its camera is bad or it does not make good pictures, but it has some drawbacks
 camera seoup kii baat karen to iske liye rier main 16 megapixl kaa ultra wide, 12 megapixl kaa wide angel, 12 megapixl kaa telephoto or ek depth vijan camera he
 For selfie, it has a 10 megapixel fivehole camera
 camera ap yani camera interphes pehle jaisaa hi he
 Since this phone has an s Pen, there are some new features for it as well
 jaisaa pehle bhi bataaya gaya he ki ab camera bhi aap es pen ke jescher control se control kar sakate hai
 Talking about the features, here are the modes like Slow Moe, Super Slow Moe, Night Mode, hypelaps, Live Focus and Food
 seen auto ditection kaa bhi feechar he
 Talking about camera performance, it has many features and good photo clicks
 live focus acha kaam karata he or becoground or forground kii pahchaan thik thik karata he
 However, there is a scope to do even better
 macro shot kaaphi behtareen hai or isi tarah wide angel lens bhi he
 All of them do their work accurately
 clic kii gai photose main ditels hoti hai, photose sharp hoti hai
 Talking about the night shot, the Pixel 3 is not of the level, but is fine
 photose aa jaati hai nite mod main bhi
 Many people did not like the selfie camera, but i did not see any problem in it
 haalanki isamen die gaye butification feechar photo ko nakli banane kaa puraa kaam karte hai
 If anyone has a little understanding of the photo, then he will understand that this photo is edited or effects are given in it
 selfi camera ke liye bhi software besd portret mod diya gaya he
 Good selfies can be clicked even in low light
 lekin noij kaaphi aaenge jo sabhi camera kii problem he
 There is no flash for the selfie camera
 You have to depend on the screen light itself
 Zoom In mike feechar bhi sahi kaam karata he or video recording ke samay dur kii aawaaj paas lagati he
 Talking about video recording, from the rear camera you can record 4K at a rate of 60 frames per second
 camera aadhaarit ek feechar he wo bhi acha kaam karata he
 For the measurement of something, you can use the Quick Measure app
 Samsung Galaxy Note + parformansamahangaa phone he, samsung kaa flagship he, productivity ke liye khaas he to aam taur par logon ko ye ummid rahati hi he ki isamen parformens ko lekar koi samjhauta nahin kiya gaya hoga
 Samsung has done the same
 parformens ke maamle main ye jabardast he
 It is very fast, smooth, there is no better smartphone than this for multi tasking
 ap switch karne yaa ap loding main koi dikkat nahin he
 The phone does not lag or hang
 company ne Android besd apane custom yujar interphes ko pehle se behatar kiya he
 i tried to play pub
 aadhe ghante ke baad phone garm hona shuru hua
 Then shut down, pubi start again
 
 But alas during the PUBG, the phone is constantly hot
 aisa nahin hona chahie
 However, use many apps with other heavy apps, the phone does not get hot
 videos dekhne main bhi garm nahin hota he
 Talking about the specifications, this smartphone has Exynos 9825 chipset which is 7nm based
 is procesar ko parformens ke liye khaas mana jaataa he
 The device i reviewed has 256GB of internal storage with 8GB of RAM
 ham zyada technicality main na jate hue aapke bataa den ki phone kaa parformens shandaar he or ye aapako katai niraash nahin karegaa
 Under display fingerprint scanner needs to be more fast
 maine zyaadaatar baar pin yuj kiya he, kyonki ye utana fast nahin he
 The company should pay attention to this
 bydaree bachpaiski bydaree 4300mah kii he
 All day backup will be available easily if you use mixed
 olves on disple, age liting yuj karke bhi itani byaap aap nikaal sakate hai
 On heavy use, the battery will run out by evening
 iske saath fast charging kaa saport diya gaya he jo badhiya he
 There is also a feature of wireless charging and power share
 agar aapke paas koi wireles charging saport vaala smartphone yaa smart watch he to ise aap is phone ke peeche rakh kar charge kar sakate hai
 Tested by charging the iphone X, the charging is not too slow, and it charges properly
 kya aapako ye phone khareednaa chahie?agar bajet ijaajat detaa he to is phone ko aap kharid sakate hai
 If you are buying a phone only for camera performance, then this phone is not for you
 acchhee disple, behtareen parformens or umdaa dizin vaala phone chahie to ye aapke liye he

 Speaker Kailash Meghwal suspended 14 mlas, including twelve members of the Congress, from membership of the assembly for a year on charges of indiscipline following an unprecedented uproar in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly on Wednesday
 nilambit vidhayakon main congress ke govind dotasra, dhiraj gurjar , shakuntla ravat, ashok chandana, shravan gurjar, hira laal , sukhram vishnoi, mewa ram, ramesh meena, ghanashyam, rajendra singh, bhajan laal, nirdaleey hanuman beniwal or basapa ke manoj nyagali shaamil hai
 Speaker Kailash Meghwal passed a resolution on behalf of the Government Chief Whip Kalu Lal Gurjar to suspend these 14 mlas from the membership of the House for one year for indiscipline in the House
 rajpa ke dow
 Kirodi Lal Meena and bjp's Ghanshyam Tiwadi wanted to protest against the proposal put forward by the government chief whip but the Speaker did not allow both
 tippaniyan Speaker Meghwal said unhappily that some Hooddangi mlas of the opposition were doing indiscipline in the House by not following the traditions, rules and postures of the House
 buudhvaar ko prashnkaal ke dauraan pratipaksh ke sadasyon ne jo kuch kiya vah sharmnaak tha
 The Speaker said that i made a mistake by giving the opposition members full time to speak, but now no one will be allowed to indiscriminate in the House
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) adhyaksh kailash meghavaal ne sarkari mukhya sachetak kaalu laal gurjar kii ore se sadan main anushaasanheenata ke liye in 14 vidhayakon ko sadan kii sadsyta se ek saal ke liye nilambit karne ke liye rakhe gaye prastaav ko dhvanimat se paarit karaayaa
 Rajpa's Dr
 kirodi laal meena or bhaajapa ke ghanashyam tibadi ne sarkari mukhya sachetak kii ore se rakhe gaye prastaav kaa virodh karte hue kuch bolnaa chaha lekin adhyaksh ne donon ko bolne kii anumati nahin di
 The comments adhyaksh meghavaal ne dukhi hote hue kaha ki pratipaksh ke kuch huddangi vidhayak sadan kii paramparaon, niyamon or asana ke nirdeshon kii paalna nahin kar sadan main anushaasanheenata kar rahe the
 What the members of the opposition did during the Question Hour on Wednesday was shameful
 adhyaksh ne kaha ki maine pratipaksh sadasyon ko bolne kaa puraa samay dekar galati kii ,lekin ab sadan main kisi ko anushaasanheenata nahin karne di jaaegi

 sansad main sarkaar ke khilaaf pesh kiye jane vaale pehle avishvaas prastaav ko lekar sharad yadav ne modi sarkaar par hamalaa bolte hue kaha he ki aaj endie ke paas koi agenda nahin he or endie main shaamil saare ghatak dal peing guest jaise hai
 Comparing the functioning of the current and previous NDA government, Sharad Yadav said that it was not so in the era of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani, then there used to be a national agenda for the country
 loksabhaa main prastavidhvishwaas prastaavke bare main sharad yadav ne kaha ki avishvaas prastaav haarane-jeetne ke liye hota he, saath hi badi bahes ke liye bhi hota he
 Such debate is heard by the people of the country
 yah ek tarah se sarkaar ke saare kaamkaaj ko lekar usko benakaab karne ke liye hota he
 He was also a restless ally in NDA and said that the picture of 'modi vs Sab' has been created, who is with him in the alliance
 har koi apni naaraazgi ab lagaataar jaahir kar rahaa he
 The Shiv Sena is already angry, staying out of voting is also an endorsement of the confidence motion
 aaj jo bhi dal bijepi ke sahyogi hai, usamen aap kisi kaa bhi naam le lijie vah sab ab baichaiyn hai
 He said, 'the public is a restless person
 noujvaan hon, kisaan hon, dalit hon, adivasee hon yaa phir vyapaaree hon yaa udyogpati har koi baichaiyn he
 The shared heritage created a big atmosphere in this country, after which the opposition parties were mobilized in a way
 sansadke baahar is golbandi se hamane 'samvidhan bachaao kaarykram' bhi kiya
 Farmers also walked from Nashik
 samvidhan bachaana jaruriunhone kaha, 'maujuuda halaat ko dekhte hue saare vipakshi dalon kaa yah ferj banataa he ki ve ek hokar desh ke samvidhan ko bachaane kii muhim main jute jaaen
 Debates through the motion of no confidence affect the state elections
 avishvaas prastaav koi bhi rakhe, lekin har party use apane-apane tareeke se mudda banaati he
 Sharad said that elections are going to be held in Karnataka
 aaj saare vipakshi dalon kii koshish hogi ki karnataka main ham chunaav jeeten, to is bahes ko ham karnataka main bhi le jaaenge or is saal jin rajyon main bhi chunaav hone vaale hai vahaan par bhi logon ke bich sachai le jaaenge
 Take the debate among the public and decide who is true

 New Zealand all-rounder Corey Anderson could score only two runs while Harbhajan Singh could not even open the account
 donon ko narayan ne pavilion bheja

 The Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party have not shown any activism on the alliance with the Congress, on the other hand the Congress has started its new preparations
 sutron ke mutabik congress shivpal yadav kii pragatisheel samaajawaadee party ke saath gathbandhan kii sambhaavna talashne main jute gai he
 However, so far no party has formally announced an alliance with anyone in UP
 sutron kii maane to shivpal yadav pragatisheel samaajawaadee party ke gathan ke baad se hi lagaataar congress ke saath jane ko lekar man bana rahe hai
 In view of this, the Congress is sending its message to the high command
 haal hi main congress ke ek netaa se shivpal yadav kii baatcheet bhi hui he
 If sources are to be believed, Congress leaders PL Punia and Shivpal Yadav are being told in contact with each other
 mana ja rahaa he ki sapa-basapa gathbandhan se alag tisare morche ke rup main shivpal yadav ke saath jane kii ranneeti ko lekar kavayad kii ja rahi he
 Shivpal was in Delhi three days ago
 is dauraan 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main gathbandhan ko lekar manthan kiya he
 However, Shivpal Yadav has clearly stated that he can go with any alliance to defeat BJP
 mahagathbandhan main agar unhen sammanjanak siten milti hai to wo iskaa hissaa ban sakate hai, nahin to duusare vikalp bhi khule hue hai
 Explain that both SP and BSP are not showing their interest in the Congress at the moment
 donon aapasi gathbandhan ke liye sahmati taiyaar karne main jute hai
 The Congress is fully aware of this and is eyeing the big event to be held on Mayawati's birthday
 darasal, kaha ja rahaa he ki isi din upi main sapa-basapa gathbandhan kaa elaan ho saktaa he
 However, the Congress does not currently consider itself separate from the SP-BSP alliance
 wo apane aapako mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa maanati he
 In such a situation, she does not want to openly show up with Shivpal Yadav, as long as there are chances of her joining this grand alliance, but in the meantime, her strategy is being considered a part of the Congress to open a dialogue with Shivpal Yadav
