 bharat, srilanka, pakistan or bangladesh quarter final main pahunche lekin 1987 ke baad ye pehla mauka he jab final main koi asian team nahin he

 iske baad 1992 main pakistan ne khitaab jeeta, 1996 main srilanka world champion bana
 Pakistan was runners-up in 1999, Team India became runners-up in 2003
 2007 main pakistan or bharat fail hue to srilanka final tak pahunchaa tha
 Whereas in 2011 the final was held in two Asian teams only

 aaj vah film release hui he, jiskaa intazaar lambey vakt se chal rahaa tha
 
 
 Vishal Bhardwaj's film 'haider', based on William Shakespeare's famous play 'hamlet' has arrived, starring Shahid Kapoor, Shraddha Kapoor, Irrfan Khan, Tabu, Ashish Vidyarthi and KK Menon in the lead roles
 
 
 'haidar' kii kahani varsh 1995 ke kashmir kii prishthbhumi par he, jahaan ek taraf aatankwaadiyon kaa aatank he or duusari ore sena kaa dar
 
 
 Here 'haider' lives with his parents
 
 
 'haidar' ke pita doctor hai, or uski maa kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa he tabboo ne
 
 
 KK Menon is the uncle of 'hyder', who is shown as a lawyer by profession
 
 
 sarhad paar kaa aatankwaadi saaya kahin 'haidar' ko na gher le, isliye uske mata-pita use padhane ke liye aligarh bhej dete hai, lekin jab vah vahaan se lautataa he to dekhtaa he ki uskaa ghar tabah ho chukaa he, pita laapata hai, or maa uske chachaa se nikaah kii taiyaari main he
 
 
 You will have to watch the story ahead of it by spending money
 
 
 ab baat karte hai, film kii khaamiyon or khoobiyon kii
 
 
 Vishal Bhardwaj has beautifully given 'hamlet' the look of the film
 
 
 naatak se pare yah film ek asli kahani kii tarah parde par ubhartee he
 
 
 The condition of Kashmir, through the story of 'haider', the way Vishal has made a statement, may surprise you, because this film plays more with mood than with visuals
 
 
 haalanki kirdaaron ke chehron se zyada unke andar jhaankne par shaayad aap majaboor ho jaaen, kyonki film ke har lamhe ko vishaal bharadwaj ne badi baariki ke saath anjaam diya he
 
 
 The pace of the film may seem slow to you, because in many scenes here the characters have less physical, mental activity
 
 
 haalanki mujhe lagata he ki vishaal is tarah ke seens ko kuch yun garh sakate the, taaki darshak behatar dhang se jud pate, kyonki kuch vakt baad film lambii lagane lagati he
 
 
 The film features a song filmed between Shahid Kapoor and Shraddha Kapoor, which you may find meaningless in a particular part of the film
 
 
 abhinayta irfan khan mehmaan bhoomika main hai, lekin unki entry or acting dhamaakedaar he
 
 
 Irrfan's character is spiritual, and it also makes him think that acting in his status is hardly under anyone's control
 
 
 shahid ke pita ke kirdaar main narendra jha prabhaavshaalee hai
 
 
 Tabu's performance is amazing, Shahid has also performed amazingly
 
 
 ab baat karte hai, film ke gaanon kii
 
 
 Although Gulzar has written all the songs excellently, but especially 'bismil
 
 
 ' behad prabhaavshaalee laga
 
 
 Sukhwinder has sung this song as beautifully as Gulzar wrote it, and Sudesh has done amazing choreography on it
 
 
 shahid kapur to vaise hi kamaal ke dancer hai, lekin is gane main mujhe unka dance ab tak kaa behtareen parformens laga, kyonki vah mood or steps ke talmail main kahin nahin chookte
 
 
 Shraddha Kapoor also does justice to her character among all these, but actors like Ashish Vidyarthi were not used much in the film
 
 
 keke menon thik-thaak hai, haalanki unke haavbhaav unki har film kii tarah isame bhi ek jaise hi lage
 
 
 i find it very important to tell the audience that if you have expectations like the spicy entertainment film from 'haider', then you might be disappointed, because this film is for those who like stories of pause and honesty
 
 
 
 meri ore se is film kii reating he - 3
 5 stars
 
 
 parade par apni shandaar prem kahaniyon kii vajah se lokapriy divangat yash chopra ne apni filmon main switsraland ke behad khubsuuraton najaaron ko hameshaa jagah di he

 After the formation of BJP government in Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath assured to make all the roads of the state pit-free by June 15
 is dedline ko ab 15 din kaa hi samay bachaa he
 In such a situation, Aaj Tak tried to know through the reality check of the roads of UP how much progress has been made in this direction so far
 iske liye 'aaj tak' team ne lakhimpur khiri, barabanki, chandauli or elahabaad main sadakon kaa jayja liya
 Lakhimpur Kheri National Highway 724 passes Delhi via Pilibhit, Lakhimpur, Bahraich, Ayodhya, Basti to Assam
 lakhimpur-khiri jile ke dhaurhara tehsil kshetra main jane par saaf dekha ja saktaa he ki sadak kitni khastahal hai
 The pits here are so dangerous that they keep inviting accidents in the coming days
 ek bade gadde ke pher main fanse ek trek kii durdasha ko 'aaj tak' team ne khud dekha
 The driver of the truck appeared to take the help of another truck and tow to get out of this trouble
 trek ke driver ne kaha ki yahaan itane gadde hai ki driving bhi musiibat ho jaati he
 The truck has to be driven by the tortoise itself
 nepal tak jane vaali roadways bas ke driver kaa bhi kahana he ki in tuuti-phooti sadakon kii vajah se nepal ke yatriyon ko kataaksh karne kaa mauka mil jaataa he
 Local citizens who use the road also say that there are so many pits here that due to these vehicles vehicles get spoiled for the day
 inkaa ye bhi kahana he ki unhen 15 june tak sadakon ke puri tarah gaddhamukt hone kii ummid he
 According to the residents of Barabanki, Barabanki, by June 15, the 'pit-free' of roads seems far-fetched
 barabanki kii kai ahm sadakon par ab bhi gaddhon kii bharmaar he
 The road connecting the National Highway 28 to the bus station, Kachari and railway station has been in bad shape for the past one year
 is maarg par bike, car, rickshaw aadi sabhi tarah ke vaahan chaalkon ko dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Despite the people's performance, the condition of this road did not improve
 nagar panchayat banki kii sadakon kaa haal jaanane ke liye 'aaj tak' team pahunchi to vahaan bhi sadak par gadde hi gadde dikhe
 Nagar Panchayat Banki is responsible for repairing these roads
 lekin chairman anshu singh ko ye nahin pataa ki kab tender hua he or kab kaam shuru hokar khatm hoga
 When he was asked, he said that if the tender is made, the work of freeing the pit will start from the 10th and efforts will be made to finish it by the 15th
 vahiin nagar panchayat ke adhishasi adhikari premnath ne daawa kiya ki ek-do din main in sadakon ko gadda mukt karne kaa kaam shuru ho jaayegaa
 Chandauli to know the ground reality of the promise to make the roads free of potholes by June 15, the 'aaj Tak' team turned to Chandauli, then the condition of the roads there was also in disastrous conditions
 kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh ke grih janapad chandauli ke mughalsarai ilaake main dulhipur se sahupuri, vyasanagar hote hue ramnagar jane vaali 12 kilometre sadak kaa jayja liya gaya to vahaan gadde hi gadde dikhaai die
 When the villagers living nearby were asked, their reply was that no one had improved this road for the last two decades
 sthaneey naagarik ramnath prasad ke mutabik sadak kii haalat itani kharaab he ki rahgeer sanbhal kar naa chalem to gir kar ghayal ho jate hai
 Ramnath said that even big officials go through this road but its condition did not improve
 elahabadilahabaad or kaushambi main bhi sadakon kii jis tarah kii haalat he, use dekhte hue 15 june tak unke gaddha mukt hone kii sambhaavna kam hi najar aati he
 Kaushambi's Manouri road has been converted into big pits
 yahaan hameshaa pani bharaa rahata he
 It is difficult for people to leave
 sthaneey nagarikon kaa kahana he ki kisi jaadu kii chadi ke ghumaane se hi yahaan kii sadakon kii haalat 15 june tak durust ho sakati he, varanaa isaki sambhaavna kam hi najar aati he
 (with inputs from Abhishek Verma from Lakhimpur Kheri, Syed Rehan Mustafa from Barabanki, Uday Gupta from Chandauli and Pankaj Srivastava from Allahabad) bharat bhale hi england ke khilaaf duusare test cricket match main haar kii sthiti main pahunch gaya he lekin salaami ballebaaj gautam gambhir ko ab bhi chamatkaar kii ummid he
 Gambhir is still at one end
 vah naabad 53 ran banaakar khel rahe hai
 He said that even before this, India has come out of such situations
 unhone australia ke khilaaf isi maidan par 2004 main khele gayi test match ko yaad kiya jisamen bharat ne mehmaan team ko 111 ran ke lakshya kaa peechha karte hue 93 ran par dher kar diya tha
 Gambhir said, 'miracles keep happening
 halaat ekadam se badal jate hai
 Anything can happen if we make a good score
 aapako yahaan us test match kii yaad hogi jisamen australia 70 yaa 80 ran par out ho gaya tha
 That was my first Test match
 ’unhone kaha, ‘kal ham prayaas karenge tathaa sakaaratmak baat yah he ki hamaare teen wicket bache hue hai
 If we have a partnership and we give them a target of 120-130 runs, then the match will become lively
 yadi hamaara score saat wicket par 113 ran ho saktaa he to ham unhen bhi aal out kar sakate hai
 They too will struggle to make these runs
 mahatvapurn yah he ki hamen gendbaajon ke bachaav ke liye acha score dena hoga
 "in the match that Gambhir is talking about, Harbhajan Singh, one of India's three spinners playing in this match, took five wickets, while left-arm spinner Murali Karthik took three wickets
 bharat ne pehali pari main 99 ran se pichhadane ke baad yah match jeeta tha
 He said, 'I believe that he (panesar and Swann) bowled faster in the air
 jab aapako wicket se madad mil rahi ho or aap gend ko hawa main teji dete ho to kuch genden spin ho jaati hai or kuch sidhi jaati hai
 "gambhir said," i think on some occasions we bowled fast in the air while on some occasions we slowed down
 is wicket main turn or oochaal he or isamen monti or swaan ne adarsh teji se gend karakar hamen pareshaani main daalaa
 We were also getting turn and bounce
 keval teji ke kaaran bada antar paidaa hua
 Gambhir favored the Indian spinners
 unhone kaha, ‘main yah nahin kahuunga ki unke spinneron ne hamaare spinneron se behatar gendbaaji kii
 If you remove the partnership of Alastair Cook and Kevin Pietersen, his other batsmen did not contribute much
 isse sabit hota he ki hamaare gendbaajon ne bhi acchhee gendbaaji kii
 "he would say that Monty bowled better than Ojha
" use atirikt oochaal mil rahi thi
 ' gauratlab he ki malishka ne kuch din pehle ek video main mumbai kii sadakon par gaddhon or trephic kaa haal dikhaate hue biemasi ko lekar gaanaa banaaya tha

 ' agar sab kuch thik rahaa to loksabhaa chunaav se pehle modi sarkaar UBI yani universal basic inakam skim ko deshbhar main lagu kar degi
 After the implementation of this scheme, farmers, traders and unemployed youth will get a fixed amount of Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,500 every month
 modi sarkaar kaa yah plan gemeanger sabit ho saktaa he
 But it is not that this scheme of giving money to the unemployed will be implemented in a country for the first time
 france, germany or japan jaise deshon main is tarah kii yojanaayen saalon se chal rahi hai
 Today we are going to tell you about some such countries where such a scheme is in force in this report
 fransad gargian kii report ke mutabik europe ke deshon main france aisi jagah he, jahaan berozegaron ko sabase zyada suvidhaayen milti hai
 If you look at the figures of 2017, then the government here will get around 7 thousand euros (5
 6 lakh ke kareeb) kii madad karti he
 That is, you get an allowance of 46 thousand rupees per month
 haalanki berozegaron ko bhi kuch sharton ke saath yah bhatta miltaa he
 Germany Likewise, in Germany too, unemployment is paid at many levels
 akele rahane vaala berozegaar takreeban 390 euro prati maah (kareeb 30 hajaar rupee) le saktaa he
 Although unemployed person does not find work for three months, then their payment is automatically reduced by 30 percent
 irelandaireland main berozegaron ko milane vaali suvidhaayen hasil karne ke liye kai kade niyam hai
 For example, you must be unemployed for at least 7 days
 iske alaava department of soshal protection ko yah bataanaa hoga ki aap‘kaam ke liye sakasham’ hai
 Apart from this, you should also have contribution in social insurance
 italyreport ke mutabik italy main berogari dar 12
 9 percent

 vahiin, japan main shaareerik yaa larning viklaangata ke saath-saath maansik swasthya thik nahin hone kii sthiti main sarkaar madad karti he
 In Japan this amount is about 153 pounds per month (about 15 thousand rupees)
 bharat main kahaan se aayaa idiakuch aisa hi universal basic inakam skim modi sarkaar lagu kar sakati he
 The scheme was first suggested by Professor Guy Standing of London University
 inaki aguwai main madhya pradesh ke indore main 8 gaanvon main paanch saal ke liye payalat project chalaaya gaya
 a population of 6,000 of these villages was benefited under the experiment
 in gaanv waalon ko 500 rupee khate main har maheene daale gaye
 150 rupees were deposited in the children's account
 bharat main is skim ke tahat kareeb 10 karod log shaamil ho sakate hai
 In the Economic Survey 2016-17, the government was advised to implement this scheme
 desh ke agle raashtrapati kaa chunaav hona abhi baaki he, lekin railway ne nae raashtrapati kii yatra ke liye aath karod kii laagat se nae salon prakriya shuru kar di he

 rajasthan royles ke captain shen warn ke khilaaf rajasthan cricket sangh (aaarasie) ne bisisiai or ipel ke paas shikaayat darj kii he
 Warne is accused of publicly abusing RCA Secretary Sanjay Dixit for not accepting his request to provide a favorable pitch
 aaarasie ne aarope lagaaya ki rajasthan royles kii buudhvaar raat gharelu match main royal chalangers bangalore ke haathon nau wicket kii sharmnaak haar ke baad warn ne apni maang puri nahin karne ke liye dikshit ke saath durvyavhaar kiya tha
 Warne has already announced that he will retire from this Twenty20 league as a player after this IPL
 aaarasie ke sthal nideshak narendra joshi ne ipel ke mukhya parichaalan adhikari sundar raman ko likhaa he jisamen unhone warn par aarope lagaaya ki unhone dikshit ke liye saarvajanik taur par apshabdon kaa upyog karke unhen jhootha or dambhi kaha
 Joshi demanded action against this former Australian cricketer
 yah ghatana savai maansingh stadium main puraskaar vitaran samaaroh ke turant baad hui
 Sources alleged that Warne, disappointed with the defeat, went to Dixit and abused him for not replying to his message
 unhone dikshit ko jhootha, ghamandi or vahaan se chale jane ko kaha
 Shilpa Shetty, the mistress of Rajasthan Royals, had to intervene
 unhone is ghatana ke liye maafee bhi maangi
 Sources said that Dixit has sent messages to the BCCI which were sent to him by Warne continuously
 is bare main jab dikshit se sampark kiya gaya to unhone kaha ki warn kaa vyavhaar shaayad team kii lagaataar haar kii niraashaa ke kaaran tha
 With these defeats, Rajasthan Royals' chances of making a place in the play-offs are almost exhausted
 dikshit ne sawaal uthaaya, bisisiai pehle hi saaf kar chukaa he pich pich samiti or curator ke daayre main aati he
 Hence, how can his demand be accepted
 uskaa vyavhaar puri tarah se anuchit tha or maine uske khilaaf karrwai ke liye kaha he
 Shilpa Shetty arrived there and took over the position
 chennai superkings or aaarasibi ke haathon gharelu maidan par lagaataar do haar se warn kaaphi pareshaan the kyonki unka maananaa tha ki pichley maheene mumbai indians kii saat wicket se haar or phir sachin tendulkar kii aalochana ke baad pich badalane se rajasthan rails gharelu paristhitiyon kaa phayda uthaane main naakaam rahaa
 Rajasthan Royals like slow pitches in which the ball is low but after Tendulkar's comment, the BCCI sent its ground and wicket committee president Venkatasundaram to Jaipur to prepare them a new wicket for the rest of the IPL matches on this ground

 Otherwise, Karol Bagh and Chandni Chowk were bored by seeing the type brides
 hare rang ke ghaghare ke saath safed bushart main dulhan bani kangana ranavat aapako bhi acchhee lagi na!
 
 
 No? Do not lie uski saadagi par to sau haryana qurbaan, lekin waisi dulhan dekhne ke liye to haryana hi jaao
 Will not be found in Karol Bagh's beauty parlor
 vaise vah khilaadi ke libaas main bhi pakki diu vaali hi lag rahi thi
 Sports quota
 jhajjar kii datto sangwan
 How easily Kangana Ranaut enters the society of Haryana in which there is so much tension in the society about women
 ek kalakaar jab apane kirdaar kaa ho jaae to badale main vah kirdaar us kalakaar ko bahut bada bana detaa he
 Kangana easily won two characters in the same film
 baawari or pagal donon ko aise nibhaayaa jaise laga ki start karun hero honda apana
 Who should talk big things
 tanu vaids manu ritern dekhakar hansi ruk sake to roak lenaa ji
 Johnny Lever, Laxmikant Berde, Rajpal Yadav and if Pappi ji is not there in this film, then films with weddings do not become a thing
 vahi pappi ji, jo zindagi main kuch paane se chook gaye, magar saath nibhaane ko hameshaa maujuud
 Like Home Delivery in Every Home
 dusron kii shaadiyon main gaate bajaate rahe or apni shaadi ke liye tarasate rahe
 Pappi Ji added color
 or rampur ke singh sahab ranjhna kii yaad dilaa gaye
 After Banarsi, now Rampuri has become a part of that work, which many of us still remain bedbug for others
 shaadi hindustani samaaj kaa sabase bada sapana or tyohaar he
 Everyone's experience is the same
 ajeeb rasm he
 So much bitterness is built on the foundation, but out of that comes an opportunity for immense happiness and memories for everyone
 chaahe shaadi mail milaap se ho jaae yaa kundali milan se
 Bengali Baba's board says that till date no one has been able to find a solution to the problems within the marriage 
 isliye shaadiyon vaali filmon kii baat hi kuch or hoti he
 The story of our house seems to be going on
 landan ke super market tesco ke cell se karidaari se lekar kanpur kaa birhaana road
 Whether we and you become a metropolitan city, it is the same town inhabited within the heart
 nostaljia hameshaa bhoot kaal main nahin hoti he
 It is also of the present tense
 abhi-abhi to ham kanpur patna chhodkar landan paris gaye hai or abhi-abhi to vahaan se aane vaala koi aam kaa achaar le aayaa he
 These films also come like a letter in one evening of our life
 jaise kisi ne puraane band pade ghar kaa daravaaza khatkhataya ho or 'koun he' bolne se pehle koi andar aa gaya ho
 Our dreams took life away from us
 ek duusare ke liye jaldi ghar aane yaa do pal kii shaam bitaa lene kii bekaraari kii jagah kahaan bachi he
 This is everyone's destiny, that's why everyone liked this film too
 pyaar karte ho yaa karte the ji
 If i ask, i will tell the truth or speak to Datto or London Returns
 badi kahaniyon ke boj se laden hue filmein nikalne kaa mood na ho to tanu vaids manu dekh sakate hai
 This is such a film that while watching, the fingers of the person are held together
 thodaa kandhe se kandhaa ladaakar ek duusare ko gudguda lete hai
 what do you want more
 lakhon kii naukari ne jivan ko udhaas kar diya he
 If a film with a ticket of two hundred rupees was made, then the deal was not cheap
 tippaniyan i did not even think that the film will start with our colleague Brij Bhushan Shukla
 swara bhaskar bhi padosan kii tarah lagane lagi hai
 There is no tantrums
 kirdaar he kirdaar ko nibhaao
 Forget who you are hariyaanvi bhai saab aapane haryana ko acha lacture pilaayaa he so aapkaa to shukriya banataa he na
 Dear Kangana, this thing has been praised

 Seeing Tanu Weds Manu return, stop laughing if you stop

 The same Pappi ji, who missed out on getting something in life, but always present to live with
 har ghar main home delivery kii tarah
 He used to sing at other weddings and yearn for his marriage
 pappi ji ne rang jamaa diya
 And Singh Sahib of Rampur was reminded of Ranjhana
 banarsi ke baad ab rampuri ban kar us kaaiyaanpane ko nibhaa gaye, jise odhe aaj bhi hamamen se kai dusron ke liye khatmal bane rahete hai
 Wedding is the biggest dream and festival of Hindustani society
 sabakaa anubhav ek sa he
 It is a strange ritual
 itani kadavaahaton ke buniyaad par rachi jaati he, magar usamen se bhi sabake liye apaar khushiyon or yaadon kaa mauka nikal hi aata he
 Whether it is marriage or reconciliation
 bengali baba kaa board bataata he ki shaadi ke bheetar kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan aaj tak koi nahin dhund sakaa he
 Therefore, there is something else about films with weddings
 lagata he ki hamaare ghar kii kahani chal rahi he
 From shopping at London's super market Tesco's cell to Kanpur's Birhana Road
 ham or aap jitne bhi mahanagareey ho jaaen, dil ke bheetar basaa to vahi gaanv kasbaa he na
 Nostalgia does not always occur in the past tense
 vartmaan kaal kii bhi hoti he
 We have just left Kanpur Patna and gone to London Paris and have just brought a mango pickle from there

 ye to sabaki niyati he, tabhi to sabko ye film bhi acchhee lagi

 If you have oneplus 3 or oneplus 3T, then there is bad news for you
 kyonki isamen Android o ke baad koi apadet nahin milegaa
 One plus has clarified this in a session of question and answer
 These smartphones will not get an update after Android O
 agar aapke paas oneplus 2 he to aapako Android n kaa bhi apadet nahin milegaa
 The company has recently launched oneplus 5, which is the company's flagship smartphone
 isamen android nugat diya gaya he
 Significantly, the latest version of Google's mobile OS i
e
 Android o is currently in beta testing phase
 isi maheene Android o google ke smartfones main diya ja saktaa he
 Philhal is not clear when the company offers Android o in its flagship smartphone
 haalanki oneplus 3 or oneplus 3T main security apadet milte rahenge
 The company has said that it will launch a beta program of Android o for the recently launched oneplus 5
 iske saath hi oneplus 3 or 3T main bhi Android o diya jayega
 The special thing is that oneplus 5 users will be given before Android o public release and they can test it
 van plus ke product head oliver ne kaha he ki Android Oaba tak kaa best or lasrepadet hoga jisamen OP3 or 3T main diya jayega
 They have also said that security patches will be given for these smartphones
 gauratlab he ki oneplu 3T zyada purana smartphone nahin he
 The company launched it 9 months ago
 isliye jinhone ise kuch maheene pehle liya he mumkin he ise ek se do salaa rakhenge
 In such a situation, if they do not get an update after Android O, then it will be disappointing
 haal main launch hue oneplus 5 main 5
 6 and 8GB RAM options are provided with a 5-inch full HD display

 uttar pradesh sarkaar ne soobe ke sabhi madrason ke liye nayaa aadesh jari kiya he
 According to the order, all the madrasas will have to write all the information including the name of the madrasas in Hindi, the time of opening and closing
 sarkaar ke mantri baldev singh olakh ne bataaya ki ye aadesh isliye diya gaya taaki zyada se zyada log jaan saken ki aakhirkaar is madrase kaa naam kya he
 Also, these people can also know what kind of education is done here
 madrason ke khulne or band hone kaa vakt bhi ab board par likhnaa hoga
 Madrasa operators unhappy with the decision, the government's order has not been taken positively by the madrasa operators
 unka maananaa he ki yah aadesh alpsankhyakon ko dabaane or un par jabardastee aadesh thopane jaisaa he
 Even before the orders were given, earlier, the government had ordered all the registered madrasas of Uttar Pradesh to sing the Rashtriya song on the 15th of August
 puure din saanskrithik kaarykram karen or in sab kii videography or photography karaaen
 Even after this, the madrasa operators raised a lot of opposition
 ab is nae aadesh se ek baar phir vivaad khadaa hone kaa dar he
 However, Minister Baldev Olak says that all these opposing parties fill the minds of the minorities
 jo sirf vot bank ke liye unka istemaal karti hai
 He said that the BJP government works for the betterment of minorities and will continue to do so
 bacchon kii behatari ke liye badlavbaldev singh ne ye bhi kaha ki ye badlaav bacchon kii behatari ke liye hai

 Order in Deoria After this order of the lawgiver, the District Minority Officer of Deoria has issued a verbal order for all the madrasas in the district
 unhone kaha he ki jile ke sabhi madrase ab urdu ke saath-saath hindi main bhi madrason kaa naam likhen
 The time of opening and closing of madrasas should also be written in Hindi, so that those who do not know Urdu can understand it

 Not only this, Azam Khan is also making objectionable comments about Jaya Prada, who is in controversy with his statements
 haalanki, jis tarah sargam film ne jaya pradaa ko hit kiya, usee tarah rampur seat par jab pehali baar jaya pradaa ne kadam rakhaa to unke kariyar ko chaar-chand lag gaye
 Jaya Prada has won the election of MP twice from Rampur Lok Sabha seat of UP
 apana pehla chunaav 2004 main jeetne ke baad duusari baar 2009 main bhi jaya pradaa ne kamyaabi hasil kii
 Jaya Prada contested both these elections on Samajwadi Party ticket
 haalanki, in paanch saalon main unke raajnneetik rishte kaaphi badal gaye
 Azam Khan brought Jaya Prada to Rampur in 2004 and contested the Lok Sabha elections for the first time against his rival Noor Bano
 ye chunaav jaya pradaa ko jitakar apane raajnneetik mansoobey main to ajam khan kaamyaab ho gaye, lekin jald hi jaya pradaa se unki adaavat bad gai
 As a result, in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Azam Khan exerted his full power to cut Jaya Prada's ticket from Samajwadi Party, but Azam Khan failed in front of Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav
 iske baad ajam khan ne chunaav main bhi jaya pradaa kaa virodh kiya, lekin wo jeet gayi
 However, his relationship with SP did not last long and Azam Khan's existence overshadowed him
 ajam khan kii sapa main vaapasi ho gai, jabaki amar singh va jaya pradaa donon ko baahar kaa rasta dekhnaa padaa
 After this Amar Singh created the National Lok Manch and merged it with Chaudhary Ajit Singh's National Lok Dal
 2014 main jaya pradaa ne rashtriya lokdal ke tikat par hi upi kii bijanour loksabhaa seat se chunaav ladaa, lekin wo buree tarah parrast ho gayi
 Jaya Pradahal with Amar Singh, however, Jaya Prada's political career began even before joining the SP and RLD
 32 saal kii umr main 1994 main wo anti rama raav (antiaar) ke bulaave par andhra pradesh kii telugu desham party (tidipi) main shaamil ho gayi
 Two years later in 1996, the TDP made Jaya Prada a Rajya Sabha MP

 donon kaa rishta charchaa kaa centre bhi rahaa
 Jaya Prada and Srikanth Nahata's relationship before marriage was widely discussed in the media
 kyonki nahata shaadi-shuda the
 The same thing became a big reason for controversy as Nahata married Jaya Prada without divorcing his first wife
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan jaya pradaaiske baad raajnneeti main bhi jaya pradaa vivaad kaa centre baniin
 When the TDP did not send him to the Rajya Sabha for the second time, Jaya Prada openly protested and expressed his displeasure, accusing other party leaders of having preference
 jaya pradaa ke jivan kaa asli vivaad rampur main hi dekhne ko mila, jab ajam khan ne unka khulkar virodh kiya
 Jaya Prada even alleged that Azam Khan distributed pornographic pictures of her in Rampur
 ab jabaki wo rampur seat se ek baar phir chunaav lard rahi hai to ajam khan or unke bich jubaani jang dekhne ko mil rahi he
 Jaya Prada is face to face on BJP and Azam Khan SP tickets

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing the Indian community just before meeting Donald Trump has given a clear indication of this
 unhone bina naam liye jahaan ek ore pakistan ko chetavanee di, to duusari ore se trump ko naseehat di
 Modi gave a strong warning to Pakistan and said that when we do a surgical strike, the world gets to know our strength
 hamane sargical strike karke yah dikhaa diya he ki ham sanyam rakhte hai, lekin samarthy bhi rakhte hai
 We do not condone global order
 ham vasudaiv kutunbakam par vishwaas karte hai
 This should not be considered our weakness

 Modi also made the United States realize global responsibility on climate change with this statement
 modi ne duniya ke saamne yah bhi saaf kar diya ki bharat kisi ke saamne jhukne vaala nahin he

 The US also believes that Pakistan is responsible for the terrorist attack on American civilians and security forces in Afghanistan

 Senior US Senator Ted Poe said that Pakistan's hands are colored by the killing of Americans
 aise main america apane hit ko saadhane ke liye pakistan ke khilaaf bharat ke saath aa jayega
 Pakistan's financial and military support from the US may also stop

 The first part was released in 2012
 iskaa nirdesan karan johar ne kiya tha
 Varun Dhawan, Alia Bhatt, Siddharth Malhotra debuted in the industry with this film
 film box offis par badi hit sabit hui thi
 As an athlete, we are taught morality in sports from the very beginning
 khel bhaavana, ekta, nishpakshta or eemaandaaree se khilne ke liye ham kai kasame khate hai
 We embody all these values in ourselves for the love and respect for sports and Olympics
 lekin kya yah sawaal uthanaa jaij nahin he ki khel prashasan main baithe logon ke naitik mulya bhi ucch hone chahie
 Today, athletes across the country want that the administrative command of their sport should be in the hands of honest officials
 lekin sachai to yah he ki vartmaan bhartiya olympic sangh (ioe) kii list main hamaara number sabase aakhir main aata he
 This association only works for its own selfishness
 ek safal olympic abhiyaan, jisamen hamane chah medal jite the, ke baad international olympic kamity ne rashtriya olympic sanstha ko nilambit kar diya
 After the best performances in the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, we should have our eyes on the 2016 and 2020 Olympics
 yuvaaon ko prerit karne ke liye desh main ek majboot olympic abhiyaan chalaae jane kii jarurat thi
 But our administrators got caught up in the debate as to whether the tainters should be prevented from contesting elections? As an athlete, we would definitely like to have a manifesto if the administrators lead the Olympic movement
 ghoshnaptr shabd ko hamaare rajaneta behatar dhang se samaj sakate hai
 In such a situation, what will be his plans to take sports forward in the country ? What will he do for athletes? What plans will he have for bringing the new talent forward and the old giants? Today, the Olympic team does not even have a permanent sponsor
 corporate houseon kaa kahana he ki vah paardarshita kaa abhaav or daagdar chhavi vaale logon kii vajah se olympic ke liye ek rupaya tak dene ko raji nahin he
 Whatever Indian athlete you ask, they will tell you the saga of unqualified coaches going on tour with them
 unase aapako ye pataa chalegaa ki khel kaa kakehara bhi naa jaanane vaale log kaise 20-30 saalon se malaaidaar siton par kabiz hai
 You also hear stories of players who spent their worst lives
 hamen olympic abhiyaan ke liye aise netaa chahie jinka ham sammaan karte hon, raajnneetik kad bhi vajah se nahin balki khel or athleates ke liye vah kya kar sakate hai, is vajah se
 We want people who are inspired and such bad situations do not arise again
 (lekhak vyaktigat swarna padak jeetne vaale ekmaatr bhartiya nishanebaaj hai
 ) wo kehete the phenko mat hamen de do
 We will raise duniya ne samajha mazaluumon kii madad karne maseehaa aa gaya

 They were danced on them
 gandi filme dikhaai gayi
 Drug injections and medicines were given
 khule or bhadde kapade pahanaae gaye
 Made of Mahfills
 rape kiya gaya
 And she endured all this
 sahati raheen kyonki or rasta bhi nahin tha
 Even if you do
 jaatin bhi to kahaan
 To whom do you tell what is happening to them? unka to koi tha hi nahin
 That is why she came here
 magar yahaan bhi
 
 
 Do not ask what happened to them
 unhone kya kya saha
 On every page of the 73-page charge sheet filed in this case, there are screams of those girls of the Muzaffarpur Girls' Home
 noche-khasote gaye unke badan kii tarah nakhun kii kharonche hai
 There are dried tears
 ghabaraai hui patharai ankhen hai
 There are sobbed sobs

 Was also tolerated
 yaheen rahati bhi thim
 Those who gave themselves in front of the Havans used to cry with pain
 or jo manaa kar diya karti thim wo bhukh se tadapati thim
 Food was not served to the girl child, who in front of Brijesh Thakur and his guests snatched on vulgar songs
 or khud ko thakur ke mohamaanon ke aage parosane se manaa kar deteen
 Among these guests were the leaders
 afasar bhi
 Both responsible and influential

 And they refused to starve
 haalanki bal adhikaar kaaryakartaaon kaa kahana he ki sibiai ne apni chargeshit main un sarkari adhikariyon ke naam chhod die hai jo in zyadatiyon or utpeedan ke bare main jaanate the
 But he neither intervened nor took any action
 sibiai ne jin 21 logon ke khilaaf chargeshit daayak kii he, unamem brajesh thakur, indu kumari, minu devi, manju devi, chanda devi, neha kumari, hema messiah, kiran kumari, ravi kumaar roshan, vikaas kumaar, dilip kumaar verma, vijay kumaar tiwari, guddu kumaar patel urf guddu, krishna kumaar ram urf krishna, rozi rani, ramanuj thakur urf maamu, ramashankar singh urf master sahab urf master ji, dow

 pramila ke naam shaamil hai
 These 21 poor people made the lives of 34 of them innocent
 jinka ab zikr karnaa bhi unke saath ninsaphi hogi

 or inaki pahchaan ko chupaane ke liye unhen ve-1 yani victim van se ve-33 yani victim therty thri tak kii koding ke saath pesh kiya he

 The country's Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar and the retired army officer have already opposed the proposal for donation presented by MNS President Raj Thackeray
 'i dil he mushkil' kii relies ke thik pehle ye bayaan aayaa he
 Devendra Fadnavis said in his conversation that the strictness of the donation of Rs 5 crore is not acceptable to me
 5 karod ke donneton kaa prastaav emenes adhyaksh raaj thakare kaa tha
 Not mine maine baithak main spasht rup se kaha ki aap jitani chaahe utani raashi deni he to den, varna mat den

 During the discussion on a question related to the politics of Maharashtra, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said that this time will go ahead or go backwards
 lekin vishwasaniyat khatm hoti he tab hamen yah drishy dikhataa he
 Modi pasted posters and asked for votes and later stood there against whom the election was fought
 yah to gathbandhan nahin he na
 This is not religion
 maharashtra main jo hua vah raajnneeti kaa nichalaa str he
 BJP will give higher level
 piyush goyal bole- sabhi siton par ladate to 200 se zyada siten hamaari hotipiyush goyal ne kaha ki yah to post-pole alliance tha, pre-pole alliance hamaara tha
 If we look at it, we won about 70 percent of the seats we contested
 shivasena bhi jitani ladi usamen 40-50 fisadi jiti
 The NCP and Congress won even less
 iskaa matlab he ki maharashtra kii janata ne saaf taur par modi ji ko vot kiya,bijepi ko vot kiya, fadanvis ko vot kiya
 Goyal further said that if we could have fought in all the seats, then we would have had more than 200 seats, but we kept Yuti Dharma paramount
 hamane shivasena ke saath vishwasghaat nahin kiya
 There was a lot of common voter base
 lekin satta ke laalach main jo alliance bana usase hamaari sarkaar nahin bani
 The public has seen how the three parties have formed a government together
 mujhe lagata he ki teenon partiyon ko aane vaale samay main puure desh main iskaa nuksaan bharna padegaa
 On this question given to the government along with Ajit Pawar, Prakash Javadekar said on a question asked to form a government with Ajit Pawar that when the Governor is satisfied then he takes the oath
 aisa kabhi hota he ki pyaar kisi or se karen or kisi duusare ke saath chale jaaen
 It is an immoral alliance
 maharashtra ne ise dekha, ab maharashtra bijepi kaa udbhav dekhegaa
 Piyush Goyal said that we thought Ajit Pawar was the voice of NCP
 shivasena se baat nahin bani
 Shiv Sena left the daemon
 hamane swaagat kiya
 After that, when he goes back, the public is watching
 janata unako jawaab degi
 The way BJP has won in Tripura has never been seen before in the politics of the country

 This is a tremendous political change in itself
 bijepi apni is chunavi jeet ko isliye bhi bada maan rahi he kyonki usne naa sirf apni kattar vaicharik virdohi ke kile ko dhaha diya balki congress ko bhi zero par samet diya
 The BJP and its allies are set to form governments in Tripura and Nagaland

 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that there is no existence on the fortress land because the leftists could not understand the soil of this country

 The Union Minister said that the Left has always been cut off from the culture and culture of this country
 vampanthi kabhi bharat kii mitti or viraasat ko nahin samaj sake
 In Tripura, where BJP was zero five years ago, for the first time in 25 years, Leleft was abandoned
 is par ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki left ko uski rhite jagah pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 Significantly, in Tripura, the BJP is set to form the government after getting a lot of invincibility, whereas in Nagaland, the BJP is moving towards forming a coalition government

 During the 12 years of Narendra Modi's tenure as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the Panchayati Raj actually stood before Modi Raj
 saidhantik taur par yahi vah pahalu tha, jiske chalate rajya kii vikaas dar maharashtra, tamilnadu or yahaan tak ki bihar se bhi badtar rahi
 Although Gujarat was in a better position than many other states, there was no improvement in the Human Development Index
 maanav vikaas suchakank kii suchi main bharat ke 30 rajyon or centre shasit pradeshon main gujarat kabhi 15wein sthaan se upar nahin uth sakaa
 The biggest reason for the devaluation of Panchayati Raj institutions was that Narendra Modi emerged as a leader keeping all the power to himself and he did not allow the power to be decentralized
 haalanki panchayat raaj ke teen mahanayake - gandhiji, balavant raay mehta or ashok mehta - gujarat ke hi the, lekin in mahaan nayakon kii majboot neenv par modi koi thos kaam karne main naakaam rahe
 On the other hand, not only Kerala and Karnataka, but also Maharashtra, Haryana, Rajasthan, Tripura, Sikkim and Himachal Pradesh also overtook Gujarat by a huge margin, and adopted the path of people-participation democracy
 modi us vakt apane aarthik agenda, jisamen garib or aam aadmi ke vikaas kii baat bhi shaamil he, ko badhaane main vyast the (mujhe is par bhi koi achraj nahin hota ki unhone kendriya panchayat raaj mantri ke taur par mere gujarat daure ke anurodh ko lagaataar thukraayaa - unhen is baat kaa dar tha ki unke najariye kaa sach sabake saamne aa jayega

 a committee headed by former Legislative Assembly Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar submitted its report to the state government last week to amend the Karnataka Panchayat Raj Act
 'karnataka main gram swaraj kaa rasta' sheershak vaali is report main sanshodhan ke kai ahm prastaav shaamil he, jo pichley 20 saal ke jamini anubhavon ke aadhaar par taiyaar kiye gaye hai
 You can also call it the experience of the last 30 years, because it was only in the '80s that the then Chief Minister Ramakrishna Hegde and his unforgettable Panchayati Raj Minister Abdul Nazir Sahib made a significant beginning in this direction
 sanshodhan ke prastaav main panchayaton se gramsabhaaon ko sabhi shaktiyon ke hastantaran, uski nigaraanee or uske niyantran kaa adhikaar dena shaamil he
 The proposal includes a sense of strengthening this decentralization from consultations at the ward level to the panchayat level
 matlab, ek hi prastaav se panchayat raaj kii sabase badi paheli kaa prabhavi hal mil gaya he - sahaayak karmchaariyon ke bich prabhavi aapasi saamanjasy kii jarurat he, khaskar badi panchayaton main
 People's participation in small panchayats is possible more effectively
 nae prastaav ke mutabik, panchayaton ke dayitvon or jimmedaariyon ko spasht rup se paribhaashit karte hue unhen kanoonee rup se adhik shashakt banaaya gaya, or 'upyogita praaanpatr' jari karne kaa adhikaar gram sabhaaon ko diya gaya
 With this, the payment of any contractor will not be approved until the Gram Sabha unanimously decides that the work has been satisfactory
 isse samudaay to santusht hoga hi, bhrashtachar or dhaandhliyon kii gunjaaish bhi behad kam ho jaaegi
 Apart from this, it has also been said to set up the district panchayat service
 isaki nigaraanee panchayat seva praadhikaar ke jimme hogi, taaki panchayat ke har str par naukarshahi, accounts or takneekee str par paryaapt sankhya main karmchaaree sunishchit kiye ja saken
 This can also be accomplished by the experience and training of Panchayat Samiti heads and other Panchs
 agar karnataka sarkaar, insticute of public accounts of india ke prati 10 panchayaton main ek chartered accountint ko nammaatr ke shulk main prashikshit karne ke prastaav ko sweekaar kar leti he to aadhunik, computerikrut or online prashasan kii maang ko bhi puraa karnaa sambhav hoga, jisase sthaneey prashasan kii jabaavadehi badhegi or sthaneey logon kii samasyaon kaa hal bhi jaldi nikalegaa
 In Panchayati Raj, if there is no birth like Sarpanch Raj, it will be necessary that any work of the Panchayat will be done under the committee and any decision will be made in the presence of all the members of the Panchayat
 panchayat chunaav main paise or baahubal ke jor ko khatm karne ke liye cameti ne chunaav ke liye rajya dwaara bhugtan dene kii anushansa kii he
 No private and party funding will also be allowed
 rajya chunaav ayog ko yah adhikaar hoga ki vah chunaav se sambandhit saare faisle le sake, jisamen raajnneetik dakhal ke bina panchayaton ke parisemen se lekar ummidavaaron ko ayogy tehraane tak ke faisle shaamil honge
 But the most important recommendation of this report relates to the strength and authority of panchayats
 samvidhan kii dhara 243 ji ke sandarbh kaa hawala dete hue report main vikendrikaran kii prakriya or uske content par jor dete hue kaha gaya he ki panchayat sthaneey swaraj kii sanstha he
 The detailed activity map in the attachment list of this report lists 29 subjects which are listed in the Eleventh Schedule, according to which the method of decentralization in three F-functions (functions), finance (finance) and functionalities (executive)
 Referring to
 isse panchayaton ko prabhavi taur par shashakt bananaa sambhav hoga
 Panchayats will be able to reshape, monitor and implement their plans and programs for economic development and social justice
 iske alaava yah prastaav bhi he ki rajya vitt ayog kii anushansaaon ko usee tarah se sweekaarya or lagu kiya janaa chahie, jis tarah kendriya vitt ayog kii anushansaaon kaa hota he
 Karnataka does not need to get approval from the central government to implement these revolutionary proposals
 ve tamaam muddon par bengaluru main hi faisla kar sakate hai, vidhansabha ke samarthan se
 If the state government decides immediately, then its massive victory in the panchayati election to be held in April 2015 will be ensured
 shaayad yah panchayat-virdohi modi sarkaar ke liye sabak hoga ki ve sab logon ko kuch samay ke liye murkh bana sakate hai yaa phir kuch logon ko hameshaa ke liye murkh bana sakate hai, lekin sab logon ko hameshaa murkh nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 In West Bengal, the Election Commission has banned campaigning from 10 pm onwards
 
 This is a decision of the Election Commission that has sparked debate
 
 Many people are saying that if the Election Commission had to stop campaigning, then it should have been stopped from 10 o'clock on the 15th
 use 34 ghante kyon badhaayaa gaya
 Is it because the Prime Minister was to have two rallies in Bengal
 chunaav ayog apane is faisle ko lekar vivaad ke ghere main aa gaya he or us par pakshpaat karne kaa aarope lag rahaa he
 This is not the first time that fingers are being raised in this manner on the Election Commission
 uske kaamkaaj ko lekar desh ke pramukh buddhijivi bhi sawaal uthaa chuke hai or supreme court bhi tippanee kar chukaa he
 And all this is happening with regard to West Bengal because the dispute between BJP and Trinamool has increased here
 tanatani to pehle se hi thi magar amit shah ke road sho ne aag main ghi daalane kaa kaam kiya kyonki usamen se hinsa kii khabar ai or halaat bekaabu ho gaya
 In West Bengal, the relationship between Mamta Banerjee and the Prime Minister has been tense
 san 2014 main mamata ne modi ji ko danga babu kaha tha
 This time the Prime Minister gave Bengal the name of Triple t i
e
 Trinamool, Tolabaji, Tax
 is par jaahir he mamata banerjee aag babula ho gayi
 Mamta also left no stone unturned this time
 usne yogi,smriti irani or amit shah kii sabhaaon or road sho par roak lagaai or helicopter na utarane dene kaa aadesh diya
 The dispute kept growing
 darasal is takaraar kii kahani shuru hoti he 2017 main jab bijepi ne purab dekho yani purvottar ke rajyon jisamen assam, tripura or purvottar ke rajya shaamil hai, ke liye ranneeti banani shuru kii
 It also included Odisha and Bengal
 iskaa nateeja dikhaa 2018 ke panchayat chunaav main
 The BJP won 644 of the 1944 gram panchayats of Purulia in Bengal for the first time
 isi tarah jhargram ke 806 main se 329 siten jeetin
 Trinamool lost 28 gram panchayats in 79 in Jhargram
 jhargram vahi ilaaka he jise mamata banerjee ne sabase pehle 2011 main vamadalon se chhina tha or trinmul congress ke udai kii shuruyaat hui thi
 History was repeating itself again
 is baar or bijepi jhargram main ubharne lagi thi
 Where Trinamool won 21,110 panchayats in the panchayat elections, BJP came second
 usne 5,747 panchayaton par kabja kiya
 On the other hand, the Left parties have 1,708 panchayats and the Congress has 1,062 panchayats
 
 The leftists had started to be wiped out
 san 2011 main jahaan vamadalon ke paas kareeb 40 fisadi vot the wo 2016 main ghatakar 25 fisadi rah gaya tha
 Not only this, the cadres of the Left parties were now joining the BJP to avoid the Trinamool Congress cadre
 unamem trinmul se badla lene kii bhaavana bhi thi
 He disliked Mamta
 yahi sab ab khulkar saamne aane laga he
 This is the reason for the conflict between Trinamool and BJP workers
 kolkata iskaa kendra bindu bana hua he
 The reason is that the nine seats in the last round where elections are being held are all around it
 
 All are related to each other
 damdam,barasaat,basirhaat,jayanagar,mathurapur,diamond harbar,jadhavpur,kolkata dakshin,kolkata uttar main 19 may ko vot daale jane hai or abhi in sabhi nau siton par trinmul congress kaa kabja he
 In 2014, BJP was second in North Kolkata and South Kolkata and this time there is a tough fight between BJP and Trinamool Congress in the remaining seven seats
 yahi vajah he ki pradhanmantri kehete hai ki is baar kii sarkaar pashchim bengal se banegi
 The BJP feels that the seats in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are going to be repaid from West Bengal and Odisha
 jaahir he jab daanv par itnaa kuch laga ho to kuch bhi kiya ja saktaa he or kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 So this is the story of the conflict between the Trinamool Congress and the BJP in West Bengal

 The Left Party has now opened a front against the amendment of the law brought in the Lok Sabha to stop the investigation of foreign funds received by the Modi government to political parties
 sipiem netaa prakaash karaat ne 'ajtak' se baatcheet main kaha ki unki party is kanoon kaa virodh karegi
 The central government introduced an amendment to that law in the Lok Sabha and got it passed amidst noise, so that any foreign donations received by political parties from 1976 till now will not be investigated
 finance bill ke jariye laae gaye is kanoon ko loksabhaa kii manjuuri mil chuki he
 The most surprising thing is that such an important law was passed in the Lok Sabha without any discussion
 prakaash karaat ne ajtak se baatcheet main kaha ki sansad main hangaame ke bich isko finance bill bana kar paas karvaa liya gaya
 He told that the same law was brought in the year 2016, but then the High Court was found guilty in the Congress and BJP for taking foreign donations and to avoid that, now the Modi government has brought this bill to be implemented again from 1976
 
 is bill ke khilaaf seetaram yechuri ne supreme court main yachika daakhil kii he
 Prakash Karat says that we oppose this law
 finance bill hone ke naate rajyasabha main bhi is kanoon ko roka nahin ja saktaa
 Prakash Karat says that now any foreign company can fund political parties by opening a branch in India, which will not be investigated, CPM is against this law
 adaalat ke alaava left partiyaan sadak par bhi is masale ko uthaakar bijepi ko gherne kii koshish karengi
 Amid the uproar in Parliament, the government approved 21 amendments to the Finance Bill 2018, one of which was the Foreign Fund Regulation Act 2010
 yah kanoon ab tak bharat kirajnneetik partiyonko videshi companiyon se chanda lene se roktaa tha
 The government brought this bill as a finance bill so that this law will no longer be stopped in the Rajya Sabha and after its implementation all political parties in India will be able to collect donations from any foreign company and it cannot be investigated
 sipiem netaa prakaash karaat kaa aarope he ki bijepi ne is kanoon ke jariye bijepi or congress donon ke chande ke khilaaf 2014 main aae dilli hoicourt ke aadesh se bachaa liya he
 In 2014, the Delhi High Court found the BJP and Congress guilty under the FCRA case in connection with foreign funds and also ordered the central government to take action against these two parties
 karrwai se bachane ke liye centre sarkaar vitt vidheyak 2016 lekar ai thi jisamen videshi chanda niyaman kanoon yani epasiare main sanshodhan kar diya gaya tha
 Now through 1976, the possibility of investigating every donation to political parties has been eliminated through this new law
 vampanthi dalon kaa kahana he ki vah ab sadak par is kanoon ke khilaaf ladaai ladenge
 At the same time, a petition filed by Sitaram Yechury against this bill is pending in the Supreme Court

 Faisal, 35, has said that his resignation was due to his' secondary status due to marginalization of about 200 million Indian Muslims by Hinduist forces, insidious attacks on the special identity of the state of Jammu and Kashmir and of hyper-nationalism in India
 It is against the growing culture of intolerance and hate in the name
