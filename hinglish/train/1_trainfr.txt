 12:05 AM gujarat: vijay roopaani or nitin patel 26 disambar ko lenge shapath BJP state president Surya Pratap Shahi, who resigned from his post, finally broke his silence on the issue of bsp's controversial leader Babu Singh Kushwaha being inducted into the party
 party ke navaniyukt pradesh adhyaksh lakshmikant bajpeyi ke swaagat ke liye party mukhyalay par hue samaaroh ko sambodhit karte hue shahi ne kaha ki bhaajapa main kushvaha ko shaamil kiya janaa mere kaarykaal par ek kaalikh he
 Also because the responsibility falls on me, while the truth is that i had no role in this decision
 shahi ne kushvaha ko party main shaamil kiye jane main apni koi bhi bhoomika nahin hone kaa daawa karte hue kaha ki unhen party ke is nirnay kii jaankaree kushvaha ko shaamil karne kii ghoshnaa ke liye hue samvaadadaata sammelan se mahaj do ghante pehle mili thi or usamen ve party kaa pradesh adhyaksh hone ke naate upasthit hue the
 He said that i thought that before i was relieved of the post, i should clear the spots on my tenure
 kushvaha ko party main shaamil karne ke nirnay main meri koi bhoomika nahin thi or ye nirnay party netritv kaa tha
 Shahi pointed to the rumors that arose on the issue of taking Kushwaha to BJP and said that it is rumored that i have taken two hundred crores rupees to join Kushwaha in the party, whereas i am not guilty of even two paise in this case and i had never seen Kushwaha before that
 kushvaha ko party main shaamil karne ke liye dilli main hue samvaadadaata sammelan main maujuud rahe party ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh vinay katiyaar ne baharhaal is mudde par do took kaha ki is mudde par koi safai nahin deni he
 We did what the party leadership told us
 hamen is baat ko lekar koi ghabrahat nahin he ki log athwa media is sambandh main kya sochataa he
 Katiyar also said that the party lost in the election because it had lost its "ramism"
 party ke ek anya purv pradesh adhyaksh omprakash singh ne kaha ki jis din dilli main kushvaha ko party main shaamil kiye jane kii ghoshnaa hui, ve bhi dilli main hi the or rashtriya adhyaksh nitin gadakari ke ghar par is vishay main salaah mashvira hua tha
 a car suddenly caught fire near the Yamuna Bank metro station in Delhi
 fire brigade kii gaadi jab tak aag par kaabo paati, tab tak car jalakar khaak ho chuki thi
 Actually, this wagonr car was coming from Akshardham, when the driver Santosh was seen light smoke coming out of the car near the Yamuna Bank Metro Station
 iske baad vah car rokkar jaise hi baahar niklaa tha ki, car dhun-dhun kar jalane lagi
 Santosh immediately conveyed this to the police and fire brigade, after which fire brigade vehicles reached the spot
 haalanki tab tak vah car jalakar khaak ho chuki thi
 Santosh told that this car was purchased a few months ago and was running in Uber service
 is car main sienji kit laga hua tha
 He told that he had taken a ride a while back and after filling CNG in the car and went in search of another ride, it happened
 yahaan gaur karne vaali baat yah car main yun achaanakaag laganeka ye koi pehla maamla nahin, isse pehle bhi aise kai maamle saamne aa chuke hai

 bihar main vidhansabha chunaavon main bhale hi abhi samay he par raajnneetik paara abhi se chadhane laga he
 While the BJP and JDU are excited by the massive public support in the Lok Sabha elections, on the other hand RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, who has been missing from the politics of Bihar for the last three months, has become active again
 mangalvaar ko purv mukhyamantri rabari devi ke sarkari awaas 10, circular road par jo mahagathbandhan kii baithak hui jisamen congress kii taraf se pradesh adhyaksh madan mohan jha, rashtriya lok samta party ke netaa upendra kushvaha, hindustani awam morcha ke rashtriya adhyaksh jithan ram maanjhi, vikasshil insaan party ke netaa mukesh saahani shaamil hue
 Since then, questions have arisen as to whether Tejashwi will be the leader of the grand alliance in the assembly elections next year
 isko lekar mahagathbandhan ke sabhi dalon kaa kahana he ki abhi is sawaal kaa koi matlab nahin he, isko lekar baad main charchaa hogi
 Let us tell you that in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav was considered by all parties of the Grand Alliance as their leader and the Lok Sabha elections were also fought under his leadership
 agle saal hone vaale bihar vidhansabha chunaav main bhi kya tejasvi yadav mahagathbandhan ke netaa banenge
 Political parties involved in the grand alliance will project Tejashwi as the next chief minister
 isko lekar ab mahagathbandhan main asamanjas kii sthiti paidaa ho gai he
 The national president of Hindustani Awam Morcha and former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi said after this meeting that the question whether the Tejashwi Yadav grand alliance should be considered a leader or not
 maanjhi ne kaha ki is mudde par charchaa baad main hogi or agar jarurat padi to mahagathbandhan kii ore se mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar koun hoga uske naam kii ghoshnaa chunaav ke vakt hi kii jaaegi
 However, RJD has already announced that Tejashwi Yadav will be their chief ministerial candidate for the 2020 assembly elections
 " "jab pichley saal party mukhyalay par congress sthapana diwas ke aayojan kaa rivaaj nibhaayaa ja rahaa tha ki tabhi sonia gandhi ne achaanak sevadal pramukh mahendra joshi ko ishaare se bulaayaa
 Pointing towards some activists, he said, "they are just shaking their lips, they don't remember Vande Mataram"
 is baat se chaunk kar joshi ne vaada kiya ki ve sevadal ke agle prashikshan shivi main iske liye kuch karenge
 The purpose of the forgotten establishment but this matter is not limited to the words of the national anthem
 lagata he ki party ke agrani sanghathan sevadal kaa ek prabhaavshaalee gut uski sthapana ke makasad ko hi bhul gaya
 Along with the Indian Youth Congress, the Women's Congress, the Indian National Students' Organization (NSUI) and the Indian National Workers Union Congress (INTUC), it has also been known as the leader-building organizations for the main party
 lekin lambey samay se ye sanghathan sirf dikhaawati daftar banakar rah gaye hai
 That is why it took Rahul Gandhi two years to revive the youth organization
 sanghathan ko sanvaarane kii darkarasitambar 2007 main jab gandhi parivaar ke uttaradhikari ne party mahasachiv kaa kaarybhaar sambhala to us samay yuvak congress utaavle, dishaheen or javaani paar kar chuke sadasyon kaa jhund bhar tha
 The energetic energy of this organization, which has led many movements under the leadership of Sanjay Gandhi, was being wasted in the activities of hooliganism and manipulation
 teen saal pehle yuvak congress ke adhyaksh ashok tanvar ne niraashaa ke saath sweekaar kiya tha ki jod-tod karne waalon or saudebaajon kii chhavi ne sanghathan par grahan laga diya
 But today the same tanwar again appears active
 ve kehete hai, ''pehle jab ham koi faisla karte the to mushkil se hi use lagu kar pate the
 We were always pressurized by some big leader to change it
 lekin ab aisi baat nahin he
 "the question of the umbrella has always been important in the Congress
 It has always been important that the person or organization is under whose umbrella
" jab varadahast mukhya parivaar ke uttaradhikari kaa ho to baat hi kya
 Tanwar cites the example of the son of a Congress leader who was working against the party
 is maamle main pradesh congress adhyaksh ne phone karke kah diya ki ''ham pita ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kar sakate kyonki ve bade netaa hai, lekin aap unke bete ke maamle main kya kar rahe hai?'' tanvar tasalli bhari muskaan ke saath kehete hai, ''hamane us netaputra ko nikaal diya tha
 If we had done this earlier, we would have got a call to withdraw this decision
 lekin ab aise phone nahin aate
 "nobody cares about the Seva Dal
 The situation is that neither the young successor nor any big leader cares about the Seva Dal
" sanghathan kii sthapana 1923 main jail bhej die gaye swatantraaa senaniyon ke pariwaron kii sahaayta ke liye kii gai thi
 Later it merged with the Congress
 mukhya sanghathankarta joshi kehete hai, ''hamaara kaam mukhya party ke liye kaaryakartaaon kii team taiyaar karnaa he
 "50-year-old Joshi wants to do a lot of work but does not have the name of Gandhi to achieve more achievements
" paanch saal se zyada ho gaye jab sevadal kii mukhiya sonia gandhi ne jaipur main sanghathan ke prashikshan shivi main hissaa liya tha
 He monitored the organization's routine with great interest for three days, which began with physical exercises at four in the morning and then proceeded with flag-raising exercises and later with Vande Mataram and national anthem classes
 
 lekin yah sthiti rajeev gandhi ke us nirdesh se bahut alag he jab unhone pachaas saal se kam umr ke congress netaaon keliye sevadal shiviron main shaareerik vyaayaam anivaary kar diya tha
 Only a handful of people like Mukul Wasnik, Harish Rawat, Virbhadra Singh, who are included in the Council of Ministers today, have been associated with the Seva Dal
 yah sanghathan ab party kaaryakramon main rasmi dikhaava karne vaale sadasyon tak simit hokar rah gaya he
 Jawaharlal Nehru envisioned Seva Dal as a counter-organization to the RSS
 iske kaaryakartaaon se ummid kii jaati thi ki ve sankatagrast kshetron main jaakar sahaayta karen
 But the RSS has always been ahead of the Seva Dal in getting publicity
 joshi bachaav kii mudra apanaate hue kehete hai, ''aresas photo khinchvaane main hi aage rahata he
 The khaki nicer easily identifies its members
 ''topi pahanane ko lekar bhi duvidhasevadal kaaryakartaaon kii pahchaan unki khaas tarah kii gandhi topi se hoti he, lekin ye tapiyaan vishesh maukon par hi pahani jaati hai
 Prahlad Yadav, former chief of the Seva Dal, used to complain that as soon as a worker wore this hat, a big leader sent him to do the work of forced labor
 vaise bhi sevadal pahchaan ke sankat se guzar rahaa he
 Like the Youth Congress, it needs to change itself over time
 joshi bhi yuva peedi kaa saath paane kii vakaalat karte hai
 But apart from the wear and tear of the Congress, they are unable to offer anything new to them
 isaki tulana aap yuvak congress se kar sakate hai jiske vigyapanon par rahul kii tasviir he or jisaki sadsyta ke liye bheed lagi hui he
 How can Joshi compete? They suggest wearing new high fashion white caps and jackets to attract the youth during relief operations
 sevadal ke ek kaaryakarta kaa mazaakia andaaj main kahana tha, ''gandhiji ko bhi prachaar ke liye munnabhai kii jarurat padi
 "challenges of women members no less
 The challenge is even more difficult for women Congress
 purushon ke sanghathanon ke saathi use vibhinn cametiyon main mahilaon ke aarakshan kii saudebaaji kaa madhyam maanate hai
 Some even say that the Women's Congress should be dissolved now because the reservation has confirmed the representation of women in the party
 is samay nau mahasachivon main se keval ek ,or 40 sachivon main se 5 mahilaayein hai
 The office of the Women's Congress is confined to a few rooms in a corner of the headquarters, where adult women, clad in tight cotton robes, perfume the perfume, rage their organizations on what they call a kitty club and present a decorative list of movements Huh
 saamaajik kaam se judane kii salaahsanghathan kii adhyaksh prabhaa thakur kahati hai, ''sonia ji ne mujhase kaha he ki mahila congress ko rajnatik jimmedaariyon ke alaava saamaajik kaamon main bhi laganaa chahie
 "she has also met the Prime Minister and Sonia along with the delegation to demand reservation for women in central government offices
" unke baaki kamdhaam kii suchi bhi mahilaon ke muddon se hi sambandhit he jinamein mahila varg kii samasyaayein shaamil hai
 Except for the well-known issues, this organization still has its own identity
 vah indira gandhi ke us sapane se kaaphi dur he jise ve sangh kii durgavahini se takkar lene vaale sanghathan ke rup main dekhnaa chaahati thim
 When she gets out of her tied-up thinking, she takes a leaflet on Sonia
 thakur kahati hai, ''is tarah kaa soch thik nahin he
 Women work hard in Congress movements
 ham sidhe rasoighar main jaakar mahilaon se sampark kar sakate hai, jo purush nahin kar sakate
 '' Kapil Sibal, Ghulam Nabi Azad and V
 narayan swami jaise naamon ko chhod den to unke purush saathi unke kaamon kii saraahna nahin karte
 Joshi and Thakur can give direction to the organization, but it can only be done by the members associated with the chief's family
 vishesh bhoomika apnaane kii jarurathar sanghathan ko apane liye ek vishesh bhoomika apnaane kii jarurat hoti he, jo uski khaas pahchaan ban jaati he
 The Youth Congress is no longer the ravaged organization it was in Sanjay's time
 rahul peshewar kaushal vaale vinamr or bhadra yuvakon ko aakarshith kar rahe hai
 Tanwar tells the soldiers of the Congress to be the soldiers of the common man who supervises the development programs at the panchayat level
 yuvak congress kepurv adhyaksh manish tiwari kehete hai, ''kisi bhi sanghathan kii bhoomika samay ke sandarbh main samajni hoti he
 Today, there is a need for a more democratic and mind-numbing way of working with more thinking
 ''yuva sanghathanon se badlaav kaa aagaajarahul ne parivartan kaa kaam yuva sanghathan se shuru kiya he, lekin party ke anya agrani sanghathanon main bhi sudhaar kii jarurat he
 a general secretary of the Seva Dal said in some terse manner, "we should dissolve the dinosaurs of the past
" '' yah baat intak ke maamle main khari baithti he jo majdoor sangh kii jagah antarrashtriya sangoshtiyon main bhaag lene ke liye yatri agent kii tarah zyada kaam karata he
 Like other things in the Congress, change must be started from the top, otherwise it is inevitable that these organizations are lost in oblivion

 sanjeev reddy mukhiya hai
 Seeing himself falling apart in Uttar Pradesh politics, Rashtriya Lok Dal President Ajit Singh has once again hinted at coalition politics
 isbaar ye sanket sapa supremeo mulaayam singh yadav ko diya he
 Citing the upcoming election, Ajit on Saturday issued a letter urging that followers of Chaudhary Charan Singh and Lohia should come on one platform
 nitish ke shashan kii tarifasaaf he ajit singh uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party ke saath janaa chaahate hai
 They also want JDU to be included in this alliance
 is chitthee main ajit ne bihar ke mukhyamantrinithish kumaror sharad yadav kii tarif karte hue likhaa he ki bihar main nitish kaa gavarnence choudhary sahab ke sapanom kaa gavarnence he
 The appeal of all parties to be one, which could not be formed in the Bihar elections, now wants to make Ajit Singh and Mulayam Singh before the UP elections
 isiilie is chitthee main nitish kumaar or sharad yadav tak se ek hone kii apil kii gai he
 Through this letter, efforts are being made to form an alliance for the alliance so that the scattered parties can come on one platform
 shivpal yadav gathbandhan ke paksh menye chitthee samaajawaadee party main amar singh or shivpal yadav kii badhati haisiyat kii ore bhi ishaara karti he, kyonki ye donon netaa kaaphi vakt se ajit singh ke saath gathbandhan ke paksh main rahe hai or shivpal to is gathbandhan ke liye khuli vakaalat karte rahe hai
 Now that Shivpal Yadav has become the state president and Amar as the national general secretary, in such a situation, this letter is being linked to the will of the socialist
 philhal samaajawaadee ne is chitthee par apni pratikriya nahin di he lekin mana ja rahaa he jald hi ek gathbandhan kii disha main partiyaan badhengi jo chunaav ke pehle mahagathbandhan kaa swaroop le sakati he
 Not easy to convince Nitish: Before the Bihar elections, Mulayam Singh's departure from the grand alliance had left the Samajwadi Party deeply wounded
 tab nitish kumaar ne mulaayam singh kii khuleam aalochana kii thi
 Recently, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi also accused Mulayam Singh of not being able to stand on the spot against BJP in his Kisan Yatra
 aise main uttar pradesh chunaav ke pehle samaajawaadee party ke liye mahagathbandhan bananaa ek mushkil baat jarur he lekin ajit singh kii chitthee ko isi chashmen se dekha ja rahaa he ki shaayad unki pahal par mahagathbandhan kii pahal patari par laut aae
 It will not be easy to convince Nitish Kumar, who was injured on one occasion in Bihar, that too when Nitish Kumar is close to jdu-congress and in the mood for alliance with Congress before the elections
 mahagathbandhan kii jameen taiyaar karne kii hui pahalapashchimi uttar pradesh main ajit singh kaa janaadhar rahaa he or samaajawaadee party philhal vahaan kamjor dikh rahi he
 In such a situation, both parties are eager for an alliance, but the doubt about who should take the initiative ended with Ajit Singh's letter
 ab mahagathbandhan ke liye jameen taiyaar karne kii koshish he jise kitna samarthan miltaa he ye dekhnaa dilachasp hoga

 nausena ne kaha ki yah tainaati uske 'mishan aadhaarit tainaati' ke taur par kii gai he
 Maldives is a small country right, but really important for India
 jaaniye aisi das vajahen ki hamamaldivake halaat par mookadarshak kyon nahin rah sakate
 
 
 1
 maldive hind mahaasaagar main samrik rup se kaaphi mahatvapurn jagah par sthit he
 It is just 700 km from the Lakshadweep group of our country
 dur he
 The Maldives is adjacent to an important ship route that supplies energy to many countries such as China, Japan and India
 bharat kaa kareeb 97 fisadi antarrashtriya vyapaar hind mahaasaagar ke dwaara hi hota he
 Therefore, it can be understood how important it is for India to secure its routes
 2
 The Indian Ocean region has more than 40 countries and nearly 40 percent of the world's population
 china ne anti piresi abhiyaan ke naam par das saal pehle hind mahaasaagar main adan kii khadi tak apane nausainik jahaaj bhejne shuru kiye
 Due to this, the importance of Maldives grew steadily and now it has become the center of international geopolitics
 3
 India has now become an important force in South Asia
 hind mahaasaagar ilaake main suraksha vyavastha kaayam rakhane main bharat kii mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 For this India will have to cooperate with Maldives in the field of security and defense
 4
 China's growing economic cooperation with Maldives is a matter of concern for India
 maldive ke videshi karj main kareeb 70 fisadi hissaa china kaa ho gaya he
 The Maldives have had close ties with India for the first decades
 vahaan china kaa duutavas 2011 main hi khulaa he
 India opened its embassy there long before 1972
 isliye ab bharat ko china ke is dabadabe ko kam karne ke liye koi kadam uthaanaa hi hoga
 The current political crisis is an opportunity for this
 5
 India and Maldives have a decades-old religious, cultural, social and business relationship
 maldive ko 1965 main aazaadee milane ke baad manyata dene vaale pehle deshon main bharat shaamil he
 Therefore Maldives is important for us
 6
 There are around 25,000 Indians living in Maldives, which is the second largest foreign community
 maldive main har saal jane vaale paryatakon kaa kareeb 6 fisadi bharat kaa he
 Bollywood celebrities especially like to celebrate holidays there
 vahaan kai bollywood filmon kii shooting bhi hui he
 7
 maldive se bharat main bhi badi sankhya main vahaan ke naagarik shiksha, upachaar or kaarobaar ke liye aate hai
 The number of citizens of Maldives receiving long-term visas for higher education or treatment in India is increasing day by day
 8
 Large part of Maldives population wants India to help in this crisis
 inamen purv raashtrapati nashid kii party amdipi jaise vipakshi dal or unke samarthak bhi hai
 9
 maldive saarc kaa sadsy desh he
 India's role in SAARC is like a vanguard nation
 aisa hi chalata rahaa to maldive ke aage chalakar saarc se baahar nikal jane ke asaar hai
 Therefore, it is important for India to somehow make it into SAARC
 maldive saarc kaa ekmaatr aisa desh he jahaan piem modi kaa daura nahin hua he
 10
 maldive ek sunni musalmaan bahul desh he
 The current President Yameen has promoted religious fundamentalism in the country
 aisa mana jaataa he ki maldive se badi sankhya main noujvaan syria jaakar iageies main bhartee hue hai
 Weak Maldives can become a haven for religious extremists and fundamentalists
 iske alaava vahaan taskari or nashili dawaaon kaa vyapaar bhi bad saktaa he
 These are all things that raise India's concern

 raajnneetik vivaad main fansi TAPM kaa congress ke kai netaaon ne virodh bhi kiya
 The content of the film was fiercely debated
 maamla court kachhari tak pahunchaa
 Anupam Kher played the role of former PM Manmohan Singh
 anupam or baaki actors kii casting bhi charchaa kaa vishay bani
 But all these controversies and discussions did not benefit the box office collection of the movie
 TAPM agressive pramotion ke baavjood tikat khidki par flop sabit ho rahi he
 The film's release figures on January 11 are staggering
 anupam kher kii movie ne 4 din main bhartiya bazaar main mahaj 13
 Has done business of 90 crores
 TAPM ke collection main giravat dekhi ja rahi he
 It has become a big challenge for the film to survive at the box office
 trend pandit bhi TAPM kii niraashajanak kamai se hairaan hai
 Let's take a look at 5 reasons for beating the Accidental Prime Minister at the box office
 
 
 
 # 1
 political contentathafn manmohan singh ke raajnneetik salaahkaar sanjay baru kii kitaab par besd he
 It was already clear that the content of the film is political
 raajnneeti main dilchaspee naa rakhane vaale darshakon ne TAPM ko sire se nakaara
 The film focuses on the tenure of Manmohan Singh and the politics of the Gandhi family
 cinemagharon main antretanement kii talash main jane vaale movie lovers ko TAPM ne niraash kiya
 Critics too have not given a very good response to the film
 View this post on instagramin the last few days, from all over the world, i have got some very humbling and emotional messages for my work in # theaccidentalprimeminister
 And the appreciation continues

 The shortcoming of Bollywood's hit spices is the Accidental Prime Minister political drama
 isamen tipical hindi filmon ke chaalu masaale nahin hai
 Songs, dance, comedy and action factor are missing from the movie
 syrius political drame ko parosati film kii taraf isliye bhi darshakon kii ruchi nahin badi
 # 3
 star vailu kaa naa honofilm main anupam kher or akshay khanna ke alaava koi bada star nahin he
 The stardom of both actors is not that which can gather huge crowds of people in theaters
 kisi bade a listor actor kaa naa hona TAPM ke liye negative rahaa
 View this post on instagramone of my favorite actors @akshaye_khanna plays # sanjayabaru in # theaccidentalprimeminister
 Releasing on 11th Jan

 propaganda filmadi accidental prime ministar ko propaganda film kaha ja rahaa he
 Manmohan Singh has been glorified in the movie
 unhen hero dikhaaya gaya he
 Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi are shown as villains
 maharashtra ke kai congress netaaon kaa aarope tha ki TAPM main gandhi parivaar kii chhavi ko galat tareeke se pesh kiya gaya he
 The film's viewership was also reduced due to the movie being anti-congress
 View this post on instagrammother of all Reviews: Dulari Watched # theaccidentalprimeminister and has given her review in a One minute video
 Her first sentence was frightening
 “aise koi acting karata he?”😳
 And she almost acted me out
 But what followed was a great endorsement for my performance
 Her observation about # drmanmohansingh is spot on
 Her review is my ultimate reward
 After all these years Mom is relieved that i can act
 Jai Mata di

 The feature phone market is also growing along with the smartphone, the smartphone market in India is growing rapidly, but it is not that the feature phone market is falling during this time
 international data korporation ke mutabik 2016 kii teesri timahi main 39
 9 million feature phones have been sold
 is data ke mutabik bharat main feechar phone kii bikri main lagaataar badhotaree bhi darj kii ja rahi he
 According to the report of Counterpoint Technology Market Research, in 2016, the shipment of feature phones is increasing at the rate of 4%
 research portal imarketor ke anumaanit aankado ke mutabik 2017 main desh kii sirf 20
 Only 8 percent of the public will use smartphones
 feechar phone kii maang bhi badi hefiture phone kii badhati maang kaa andaja is baat se bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki pichley saal bharat main kadam rakhane vaali chini company Transssion Group ne apane Itel brands ke feechar phone ke badaulatbhartiya bazaar main teji se bad rahi he
 This company is eyeing India's feature phone market
 iconomik times kii ek report ke mutabik is group kii company samsung ke baad bhartiya mobile bazaar main 7
 It is second with 5% market share
 feechar phone kii maang to bharat main bad rahi he, lekin bhartiya handset mekars smartphone ke maamle main peeche to hai hin, balki feechar phone ke shipment bhi pichad rahe hai
 By the end of 2016, Bharti Player Intex was at number three in the handsed market, while Lava and Micromax were at number four and fifth respectively
 gauratlab he ki ek samay main carbon, intex, lava or micromax bharat ke feechar phone market main top hote the
 But now they are also occupied by Chinese companies
 idisi india ke senior research manager for clients navakender sih ne kaha he, ‘2017 main feechar phone segment mobile phone ke zyaadaatar hisse par kabja kar legaa
 People will use smartphones less because cheaper feature 4G phones are coming in the market 'features like smartphones are getting in feature phones! Feature phones are cheaper than smartphones and in many cases the best feature phones outperform them
 
 bydaree life kii baat karen to bazaar main gine chune smartphone hi hai jophul yuj par ek din kii byaap den
 Whereas the basic handsets with more features give at least two days of battery backup
 ab feechar phone main selfi camere se lekar jeepies jaise feechar bhi hai to kaam bhi aasaan ho jaataa he
 Itel has given features such as personal interpreter and virtual assistant in its feature phones which are available in high end smartphones
 king wois ke jariye feechar phone khud se massej ko padhakar aapako bataa degaa ki usamen kya likhaa he
 This feature will be beneficial for those who cannot see
 sibar security, hekking, virus, ranjamaware or niztaa ke maamle main bhi smartphone ke mukaable feechar phone zyada behatar opshan hote hai
 This Chinese company has also provided fast charging facility in its feature phones, which can lead to fast phone charging
 aane vaale samay main jab bazaar menounok 3310 maujuud hoga to duusari companiyonper bhi achche fitures ke saath basic handset laane kaa dabaav hoga
 Looking at the statistics, research and the best features, it would not be an exaggeration to say that in the coming times, people will be able to see feature phones but not smartphones in their hands

 bataa den ki neerav modi janvari 2018 se britain main he
 He was arrested in London on 19 March
 jamaanat yachika radd hone par usko 29 march tak ke liye police kii hiraasat main bheja gaya tha

 Threatened to kill a witness, the Crown Prosecution Service, appearing on behalf of Indian investigative agencies, said in the court that Nirav Modi threatened to kill a witness by threatening witnesses
 crown sarvice ne pienbi ghotaalaa cese ke gavaah ashish lad ke phone kol ditels ke jariye yah khulaasa kiya he
 Nirav Modi has called Ashish and threatened to lose his life if he testifies against her in court
 neerav kii jamaanat kaa virodh karte hue abhiyojan paksh ne kaha ki vah court main gavaahi se pehle gavaahon ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Also, the Crouse agency told the court that Nirav had traveled to many countries

 supreme court main ek janhit yachika daayar kar maamle kii jaanch sibiai se karaane kii maang kii gai he
 The petition states that the minister has exercised his influence over the Kochi team which is not correct
 saath hi janhit yachika ke madhyam se yah bhi poocha gaya he ki sunanda kii aay kaa kya strot he jiske jariye itani rakam di gai
 Shashi Tharoor has clarified on Twitter that Lalit Modi wanted Kochi not to be a team
 tharur ne likhaa he ki kochi team ke sabhi partner ko vah nahin jaanate hai lekin sunanda ko acchhee tareeke se jaanate hai
 It is being said that Sunanda is the wife of Shashi Tharoor
 isse pehle congress party ne lalit modi or shashi tharur ke maamle par kaha tha ki uskaa is maamle se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 The Delhi High Court has dismissed a petition against the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court for banning media reporting in a case involving sexual harassment charges
 dilli hai court ne yachika ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki kyonki yah maamla pehle yah supreme court kii nigaraanee main he, lihaaja hai court ko is maamle main dakhal dene kii jarurat he hi nahin
 High Court Chief Justice Rajendra Menon said during the hearing of the petition that there was no scope for the High Court to intervene in the matter
 anti karpshan council of india naam kii sanstha dwaara daakhil kii gai yachika main maang kii gai thi ki chif justise of india par lagaae gaye aarope us mahila ke hai, jo supreme court kii purv karmchaaree thi or kuch gambhir aaropon ke chalate hataai gai thi
 This is being done as part of a conspiracy to defame the Chief Justice of India on the basis of false allegations of such woman
 agar media main iske se jude maamle kii reporting hoti rahegi to yah bhartiya nyaaypalika ke liye behatar sthiti nahin hogi
 The petition said that the reporting of the case related to this case should not be done in the media until the committee constituted by the Supreme Court completes its investigation
 or agar aaropon main sachai pai jaati he tabhi is maamle kii reporting kii ijaajat media ko di jaae
 The petition said that the things that the media is reporting without going deep into the report can benefit the alleged 'victim'
 jabaki ab yah saaf nahin he ki mahila dwaara lagaae gaye aarope sachche hai yaa phir chif justise of india ko badnaam karne kii sajeesh
 The petition also speculated that the seditious forces could be involved in the charges leveled against the CJI
 or iskaa phayda vah log lene kii koshish kar sakate hai jinke maamle supreme court main he or jin kii sunwaayee chif justise of india kar rahe hai
 This can also be done to pressure Justice Gogoi, as he is hearing several important cases
 yachika main khaastaur se kaha gaya he ki jis tarah ke aarope lagaae gaye hai usase swatantra nyaaypalika kii karypranali ko bhi khatra ho saktaa he
 Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav has said that it will not be possible to form any government after the Lok Sabha elections without the support of his party at the Center
 mulaayam ne party ke purv pradesh adhyaksh raamacharan das kii punyatithi par yojit ek kaarykram ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'dilli main sapa ke bina koi sarkaar nahin ban paayegi
 Now the Left and other parties are also talking about the Third Front
 in sab main sapa sabase badi party he, jo log sapa ko kshetreey party bataate hai ve rashtriya raajnneeti se waakif nahin he
 Uttar Pradesh alone has 80 Lok Sabha seats
 ’yah kehete hue ki desh ke sabase bade rajya main sapa kii bahumat kii sarkaar he, sapa mukhiya ne kaha ki aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main uttar pradesh main hi nahin balki anya rajyon main bhi acchhee siten milane vaali hai
 Regarding China, he said that we have been warning the government about the possible threat from China for ten years
 sapa mukhiya ne kaha, ‘1962 main nehruji china ke vishwasghaat ko dekh chuke he
 That country is not trustworthy
 ’saal 1992 kii 6 disambar ko hue babari vidhwans cond kaa ullekh karte hue mulaayam ne kaha ki unhone 4 disambar ko tatkaaleen raashtrapati shankaradayal sharma ko patr likhakar dhaancha giraane kii ashanka jataai thi
 Addressing the program, Chief Minister and party state president Akhilesh Yadav said that the country needs SP to rule at the center and party workers have to work keeping this goal in mind
 unhone kaha ki aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main party ko centre main sattarudh congress nit sarkaar ko sabak sikhaanaa he, jo har morche par vifal rahi he
 India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh can be considered the most fortunate in the sense that US President Barack Obama spent the most on his dinner
 duniya ke kisi bhi rajaneta ke sammaan main america prashasan ne itnaa paisa nahin kharch kiya
 The US President invites politicians from all those countries to the banquet and is offered excellent dishes
 is par moti rakam kharch hoti he
 Since 2009, Obama has spent $ 1
5 million on five state banquets
 lekin sabase dilachasp baat yah he ki 24 november 2009 ko white house main bhartiya pradhan mantri manmohan singh ke sammaan main die gaye dinar par paune chah lakh dollar (saade teen karod rupee) kharch kiye gaye
 The party spent more than the state banquet in honor of Chinese President Hu Jintao

 modi sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal kii bhavishya kii yojanaon ko lekar kendricalpsankhyak kalyaan mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne NDTV se khaas baatcheet kii
 On the question of minority scholarship scheme, he said that after the historic victory of BJP for the second time under the leadership of PM Modi, rumors started spreading in the country, there were campaigns to mislead the minorities
 unhone kaha, 'devlepment vidout discrimination' yani ki 'bina bhedbhaav ke vikaas', 'devlepment vid dignity' yani ki 'sammaan ke saath shashaktikaran' ke formule ke saath modi sarkaar kaam kar rahi he
 He told that in the previous government also 3
 18 karod alpsankhyakon ko shaikshanik kshetra main shashaktikaran ke liye chaatravrutti di
 According to Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, when we studied, it was found that 30 per cent of the villages where the people of minority communities live, do not have electricity
 jab vahaan samasyaon kaa samaadhaan hua to alpsankhyakon ko zyada phayda mila
 Because until now he was ignored for the politics of vote bank
 ek sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue unhone kaha ki sirf musalmaan hi alpsankhyak nahin hai
 The center recognizes 6 classes as minorities, which include Jains, Buddhists, Parsis, Christians, Muslims and Sikhs
 iske alaava alag-alag rajyon main alag-alag virgon ko alpsankhyak kaa darja diya gaya he
 The government promises that all should go together on the path of development
 lihaaja aane vaale saalon main sarkaar 5 karod se zyada logon ko chaatravrutti yojana se labhanvit karegi
 On the issue of triple talaq, Union Minister Naqvi said that we have benefited more than 50 per cent students in the scholarship scheme
 haj cameti main bhi kareeb 2 lakh kii sankhya main mahilaayein raheen
 There have been some old practices which have been abolished, those practices include triple divorce
 jin badlaavon kii maang kii gai wo bhi kiye gaye lekin us par ab bhi aapatti jataai ja rahi he
 On the question of 'faith' being added to the slogan of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that in the first term of PM Modi, we got this belief on the basis of 5 years of work by the people
 is dauraan unhone vipaksh par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki agar yuddh ke maidan main senapati maidan chhodkar bhaag jaae to senaayen to surakshit thikaana dhundhengi hi
 He claimed that the triple talaq bill would soon be passed in the House
 teen talaak bill par jediu ke virodh par unhone kaha ki abhi wo virodh kar rahe hai, sadan main charchaa hogi or raay badalegi
 He said that because the House is held, after discussion, the bill will not only be passed in Lok Sabha but also in Rajya Sabha
 mob linching kii badhati ghatnaon ke sawaal par mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne kaha ki aisi ghatnaayen ginati kii hui hai
 And they have also been promptly acted upon
 varanaa pichhali sarkaron main aisi ghatnaon ke baad kai dinon tak karfu laga rahata tha, logon ko pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha lekin ab aisa nahin hota he
 However he admitted that there are some elements that are causing chaos that will be dealt with soon
 mob linching ko lekar media par sawaal daagate hue unhone kaha ki sarkaar ke saath-saath media kii bhi jimmedaari hoti he ki jin vajahon se samaaj main bikharaav, takaraav yaa phir unmaad kii sthiti paidaa karen, unase bachanaa chahie or unka khulaasa karnaa chahie
 Referring to the Delhi Hauz Khas incident, the Union Minister said that some chaotic elements tried to worsen the situation
 lekin vahaan ke sthaneey logon ne in sthitiyon ko niyantrit kiya, unka muqabla kiya or phir unhen parrast bhi kiya
 Naqvi said that the accused who were arrested in Rajasthan in the Pehkor Khan incident did not get bail for 6 months, in UP, the accused were arrested within 24 hours
 jai shri ram naare ke raajnneetikaran par unhone kaha ki kisi bhi cheez kii jabardastee nahin honi chahie
 The example of unity is given in our country because there is secularism and democracy in the DNA of the people of majority society
 jab bharat or pakistan kaa bantwaaraa ho rahaa tha to hamaare desh ke logon ne tay kiya ki ham dharm nirpeksh desh banenge
 He said that 'coercion' is not good, but even teasing is not good
 log chidhaaye jane ke liye vandemaataram ke naare lagane se inkaar kar dete hai
 Society should understand that their development can only take place in an inclusive manner
 do se zyada bacchon ko lekar aa rahe bayanon par puche gaye sawaal ke jawaab main mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne kaha ki koi bhi desh jansankhya visphot nahin chahega
 There should be a national debate on this issue and in the Parliament if needed
 vahiin akaash vijayawargeey or kunwar pratap singh champion jaise netaaon ke vivaad par unhone kaha ki hamaari party 11 karod kaaryakartaaon kii he
 Action is taken at the state level on such matters and the party deals with them at its own level

 Hangal 1917–2012 as an actor
 ke
 i have known Hangal since the time i ventured into acting
 lekin unhen or najadik se jaanane kaa mauka tab mila jab maine ipta (indian pipuls theatre association) ke jariye munshi premchand ke upanyaas godaan par aadhaarit naatak hori main 1980 main unke saath kaam kiya
 He was a Hori and i was his wife Coriander
 us samay mujhe pataa chalaa ki ve apane kaam ko lekar kis kadar samarpit hai
 He used to analyze his role during rehearsal and was living it the whole time
 ve hori ko kabhi paatr nahin maanate the, khud hori ban jate the
 We did six consecutive shows and the next staging turn came after about a month and a half
 lihaaja ikattha hone par ham sabane apane-apane kirdaar ko or maanjane ke liye reharsal shuru kar di thi
 Then he came to me and started giving me directions about my character, whereas in the last six shows i had played the same character with him
 us mudde par ham aapas main der tak bahes main uljhe rahe or jab hamaara dhyaan tutaa to hamane paaya ki vahaan bas ham donon hi rah gaye the, baaki sab ja chuke the
 Others had also understood his style of working, so instead of getting into an argument with him, he would quietly move aside
 kabhi-kabhi mujhe mahasoos hota ki ve kuch zyada hi sawaal poochhate hai, par baad main maine janaa ki vahi to unki sabase badi khaasiyat thi, jisaki badaulat ve khud ko puri tarah se bhulaakar kahaniyon ke un paatro kii shakhsiyat main samaa jate
 He grew up in Peshawar and moved to Mumbai after Partition
 ve darji the lekin kishoravastha main hi naatak karne shuru kar die the
 He also continued acting in Mumbai
 unhone 50 saal kii umr main apni pehali film kii
 His first film was Basu Bhattacharya's third swearing in 1966
 unhone 200 se zyada filmein kii or akasar ve pita, chachaa yaa sholay ke rahim chachaa kii tarah ek bujurg kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa karte the
 His other popular films include Shaukeen, Chef, Abhimaan and Namkharam
 kisi or jubaan kii bajaae urdu main baat karnaa unhen zyada sahaj lagata tha
 He would write his entire script in Urdu and later work accordingly
 ek baar mujhe kisi cheez ko dekhnaa tha ki vah sahi he yaa nahin, to maine unase script kii copy maangi
 He said that i will not understand the text written in it
 phir unhone bataaya, " main urdu acchhee tarah se jaanata hum or jab is tarah se likhaa hua padhata hum to apni line behatar tareeke se yaad kar paata hum
 "the most interesting thing about him was that he always wore the best attire and looked fit
 ve apane kapade usee khubi se katate the jaise abhinay karte the
 Sadly, i got to work with him only once
 main jab mumbai ja rahi thi, us samay ve theatre main zyada vyast the, lihaaja theatre se jude unke kaam ko main zyada nahin dekh pai
 My husband Jayadev knew him from the days of IPTA and we used to meet often at party or other occasions
 ve ek behtareen insaan the
 i have also heard that he used to give half of his income for the promotion of theater
 ipta ke liye naatakon kaa manchan vyavsaayik taur par mushkil hota he kyonki yah munafa kamaane vaali sanstha nahin he or iske prati unka samarpan hi sabase bada yogadan tha
 He did not mind the length of the character
 ve khud vah kirdaar ban jane ke liye turant taiyaar ho jate or kehete, "agar ham uske bare main nahin sochenge to or koun sochega?"e

 lekin isi saal agast main juvenine court ne use naaballig maanate hue 3 saal ke liye sudhaar grih bhejne kii sajaa suna di
 The parents of the deceased girl strongly opposed this decision
 mritka kii maa ne kaha ki juvenil court use sajaa nahin de rahi balki anya yuvaaon ko aisa karne ko protsaahit kar rahi he
 Preparation of new law in 2014july, in 2014, the then Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi announced that the government is preparing to bring a law in which if the culprit is between 16 and 18 and the crime is very serious then action against him The mango will be like a criminal

 Kameleshi Devi's mistake was that when the calf was drinking milk, she tried to remove it from there
 bachade ke ade rahane par mahila ne rassi khinchi, jo bachade ke gale main kas gai
 The calf collapsed and he succumbed in a short while
 is baat ke failte hi gaanvvaalon ne subah panchayat bula lee or farmaan suna diya
 There is no dearth of anything in Kamleshhi Devi's house

 The tweet of the Golden Girl and young shooter from Haryana has warmed up the political climate in the winter season in Haryana
 16 saal kii yuva khilaadi jhajjar jile kii manu bhaakar ne ek twit kiya he ki sarkaar ne youth olympic jeetne par 2 karod rupye kii jo raashi dene kaa elaan kiya tha, kya vah jumala tha yaa yah raashi use milegi bhi
 After this, Haryana Sports Minister Anil Vij made a tweet to Manu Bhaker and asked him to focus on his game while remaining disciplined
 unki raashi unhen de di jaaegi
 Significantly, on winning the gold at the Youth Olympics, Sports Minister Anil Vij had also announced a reward of Rs 2 crore to Manu Bhaker on Twitter, which Manu Bhaker has not yet received
 aise main saamne aayaa he ki haryana kaa khel vibhaag youth olympic vijeta ko do karod kii raashi de hi nahin saktaa he kyonki praavdhaan sirf ek karod dene kaa he
 It is different that Manu Bhaker has not received even 1 crore rupees, but the sports minister of Haryana has definitely got the advice to remain in discipline
 Sir Please confirm if it is correct
 
 
 Or just Jumla

 com / atxplkbsyv— Manu Bhaker (@realmanubhaker)january 4, 2019manu bhaakar or anil vij ke twits par haryana ke purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ne bhi nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Hooda said that there is no doubt that Haryana players have won their names in the country and the world
 lekin pichley varshon main kai baar aisa hua he ki unhone khilaadiyon ko pareshaan or hairaan hote hue dekha he
 Actually, this is a directionless government and is not giving due respect to the players
 gauratlab he ki ek samay main manu bhaakar ko antarrashtriya pratiyogitaaon main jane se pehle haryana sarkaar ne gan kaa license bhi nahin diya tha or jab ajtak par yah khabar chali to uske baad haryana sarkaar ne manu bhaakar ko license diya tha
 Now after Manu Bhaker's tweet on the amount of the reward, politics has once again got hot
 nirbhayacand ke naaballig doshi kii ravivaar ko rihaai honi he
 The Delhi Commission for Women has approached the Supreme Court to block the release of the juvenile convict at the last minute
 supreme court main ab sunwaayee somvaar ko hogi
 But the court has not stayed his release on Sunday as the court did not hear the case immediately
 ayog kii adhyaksh swati maniwal ne kaha ki naaballig doshi somvaar tak reeha naa ho
 The case is now pending in court
 dilli mahila ayog aadhi raat ko supreme court main pahunchaa tha
 There DCW filed a special leave petition to stop the release of the minor convict
 jise court ne baad main sweekaar kar liya or sunwaayee ke liye raji ho gaya
 Moved to a secret place, before this, the minor convict is suddenly shifted from Majnu Ka Tila Correctional Home to a secret place
 yah kadam uski suraksha ke maddenjar uthaaya gaya he
 The minor convict was sentenced to three years in the case of gang rape and murder of Nirbhaya
 kanoon use sudhaar grih main rakhaa gaya tha
 Technically, his sentence is being completed on Sunday
 reeha hone ke baad naaballig doshi kii suraksha police prashasan ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab bani hui he
 He was shifted to a secret location a few days ago due to security reasons
 abhi vah ek enjio kii dekharekh main he
 The Juvenile Justice Board is also overseeing it
 doshi ab 21 saal kaa ho chukaa he
 He himself has requested to shift to another place, threatening his life
 philhal uski dekharekh koun si enjio kar rahi he, iskaa khulaasa nahin kiya gaya he
 Now the Juvenile Justice Board is working on rehabilitation after his release

 gauratlab he ki 30 july ko ahmedabad main hue serial dhamaakon main 53 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has approved Indiabulls Housing Finance's proposed merger with the nearly 93-year-old Lakshmi Vilas Bank
 indiabulls houseing finance ne share bazaar ko di jaankaree main bataaya, " bhartiya pratispardhaa ayog ne 20 june 2019 ko hui apni baithak main vilay ke prastaav par vichaar kiya or use manjuuri de di he
 "however, to complete the merger process, the approval of RBI, SEBI and other institutions is required
 is prakriya main 6 se 8 maheene tak kaa samay lag saktaa he
 Explain that in April 2019, Lakshmi Vilas Bank announced a merger with Indiabulls Housing Finance
 lakshmi vilaas bank ke nideshak mandal ne prastaav par manjuuri bhi de di he
 Under the merger proposal of Indiabulls Housing and Lakshmi Vilas Bank, shareholders of the bank will get 14 shares of Indiabulls for every 100 shares
 donon companiyon ke vilay se banane vaali sanyukt ikai main karmchaariyon kii sankhya 14,302 hogi or 2018-19 ke pehle nau maheene kii avadhi main uskaa diya gaya karj 1
 23 lakh crore
 vartmaan main lakshmi vilaas bank ke deshbhar main 569 shakhaaen, 1046 atm hai
 On the other hand, if you talk about Indiabulls Housing Finance, there are 220 branches across the country
 bataa den ki saal 1926 main lakshmi vilaas bank vajood main aayaa
 It got a license in 1958 from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) after it came into existence
 iske baad lakshmi vilaas bank commercial bank ban gaya
 The expansion of the bank's branch started from 1974
 lakshmi vilaas bank ke branch or financial centre andhra pradesh, karnataka, kerala ke alaava dilli, mumbai or kolkata main bhi maujuud hai
 In recent times, politics is completely under the control of individual worship
 na sirf bharat, balki america, rus, china, turki, japan or brazil main bhi yahi ho rahaa he
 This is a result of the deep penetration of 24x7 TV and social media, as well as the collapse of narratives rooted in political and social values
 yah lagbhag vaisaa hi he jaise duniya main har jagah ke logon ne 'achche dinon' kii aas main karishmai netaaon ko kuch chamatkaarik shaktiyaan pradaan kar di hon
 Miraculous steps have often proved suicidal, such as the (2016) famous demonetisation of November 2016, which loyal media termed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's brahmastra against black money
 lekin aise maahaul main, jahaan vidrup sachaai pesh karne par amada chaapluus media ne hamaare dimag main yah khyaal tak bhar dene kii koshish kii ho ki modi bharat ko cricket vishwacap bhi jitwa sakate hai, uske liye kisi dussahas yaa dhong ko chamatkaar ke rup main pesh karke janamat ko toduya-marodsa bhala kitna mushkil hoga!aise halaat main, yahi ummid kii ja sakati he ki haal ke aam chunaav main congress kii niraashajanak haar ke liye paristhitiyon ke bajaae kuch vyaktiyon ko hi jimmedaar tehraaya jayega
 In the flash of the flash that shouted at Rahul Gandhi
 jo log congress ke liye sharmasaar ho jane yaa dub marane ko kah rahe yaa jo is haar ke liye puri tarah se rahul ko jimmedaar tehraate hai, ve yah bhul jate hai ki rahul ke netritv main haal hi main congress ne bhaajapa ko gujarat main pani pilaa diya tha or madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main sarkarein banaai thim
 Instead of resigning, Rahul should have focused on reviving the Congress and deciphering the real reasons for the defeat
 lekin agar rahul ne yah raah chuni hoti to shaayad congress ke puraane netaa 'jaise chalata he chalane do' vaali maansikta se baahar nahin aae hote
 Rahul Gandhi's resignation is a warning to the political class that he should always be accountable to public opinion, and a strong message to Congress party satraps that a major ideological battle must now be fought
 bhaajapa, congress ke astitv ke liye abhootpurv khatre kii tarah ubhari he
 And this has happened when the BJP has no real achievement in its first term
 usne apane chunaav ghoshnaa patr ko lekar bhi bahut mehnat nahin kii thi
 The Congress launched a vigorous campaign against the Modi government and took a lot of time, effort and energy to present its vision of governance
 phir congress ke liye kya galat hua or koun-si baat bhaajapa ke haq main chali gai?'rashtrawaad' kii dharna main iskaa uttar mil saktaa he
 The BJP, with the help of its sympathizers in the media, presented itself as a party dedicated to the dream of building a proud and powerful India, while successfully presenting the Congress as a party indifferent to this dream, even if not as an opponent
 congress ne rajkaaj ko lekar apana ek drushtikon to janata ke saamne rakhaa lekin vah loktantric, rashtravaadi pahchaan ko pun: praapt karne main naakaam rahi, jisko lekar vah aitihaasik or taarkik rup se daawey karti he
 An emotional engagement with the past and concern for the future plays an important role in all societies
 is deshbhakti kii bhaavana ko ek pashchgaami, dharmaandh, ativaadee rashtrawaad ke rup main yaa phir loktantric, samaveshi or aage kii soch vaale rashtrawaad ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 Academic debate on various aspects of nationalism can take place, but in everyday politics, the political power of national sentiment cannot be denied
 gandhi, nehru, patel or moulana aaazaad jaise bhartiya swatantraaa andolan ke doordarshee netaaon ko yah pataa tha
 It was the Congress that first transformed the spirit of patriotism and sentiment against colonial nationalism into an inclusive nationalism
 swatantraaa senaanee or samaaj sudhaarak dada dharmadhikari ke 'manavnishtha bhartiyata' ke swaroop main vyakt rashtrawaad kii ruparekha bhartiya samaaj ke sabhi virgon kaa pratinidhitiv karne kii aakanksha rakhti thi, digar baat he ki uski safalataa kii simaaen thim
 In fact, after Gandhi jumped into this war, the Congress became like a procession of Lord Shiva, in which a wide variety of characters, sometimes even strongly contradictory, came together
 samaveshi bharat kaa vichaar is baraat kaa duulhaa—juluus kaa bhagwaan shiv—bana
 The idea of very inclusive nationalism was included in the Constitution of independent India
 raashtra main asantoshon kaa ubhaar or unki abhivyakti, vibhinn samoohon ke paraspar virdohi hit, aitihaasik rup se aprihaary the; jo sawaal tha, or aaj bhi he—in muqablon or loktantric aakankshaon ko kaise sambodhit kiya jaae? bhartiya rashtrawaad ke kshitij kaa vistaar kaise ho? shivaji kii baraat main shaamil hue nae or mukhar baratiyon ko kaise samyojit kiya jaae?is sawaal kaa jawaab congress ne pichley ek dashak main khojane kii koshish kii he, lekin ek aise tareeke se jo uske liye nuksandeh ban gaya he
 It allowed its platform to be used by civil society activists who are trying to pursue various unified issues and agendas without a coherent idea of indian socialism
 vibhinn saanskrithik-pahchaan ke vimarshon ko samyojit karne kii utsukata main, congress ne pragatisheel bhartiya rashtrawaad ke apane vaazib daawey ko is tarah chhod diya ki aresas or bhaajapa ko apane dakshinpanthi bahusankhyakwaad ke brands ke vichaar se samaaj ko sankramit karne kii khuli chhot mil gai
 In his resignation, Rahul Gandhi expressed deep disappointment at the attitude of his colleagues, saying that in the fight against the RSS, "at times, i found myself completely alone
" '' ab unke is kathan kii tulana modi kii pehle kaarykaal kii shuruyaat main kahi gai baton ke saath karen, jab unhone centre main pehali-purna bahumat vaali bhaajapa sarkaar ko aresas kader kii 'paanch peedhishon kii kathin tapasya' kaa fal bataaya tha
 The RSS activists are so motivated by the gesture of a resolution which, though false and unclear, that they consider that resolution to be bigger than their own
 aresas or uski rajnatik ikai bhaajapa ke vipareet, congress kabhi bhi kader-aadhaarit party nahin rahi he
 It preferred to act more as a movement than a party during the anti-colonial freedom struggle
 aazaadee ke baad bhi, nehru ne aar
 K
 karanjia (patrika blitz ke tatkaaleen sampadak) ko die ek saakshaatkaar main congress jaise ek andolan ko kader-aadhaarit pranali main badalane ke 'khataron' ke bare main charchaa karte hue ise ''sangharshon, prati-sangharshon or raashtra kii jivan shakti kaa apvyay'' bataaya tha
 (the Mind of Mr
 nehru, landan, 1960, prishth
 58) However, Nehru's Congress never lost its ideological basis of inclusive, democratic, forward-looking Indian nationalism
 usne apane kaaryakartaaon ko prashikshit karnaa jari rakhaa or bharat ke apane vichaar ke bare main bade paimaane par logon ko shikshit kiya, yahaan tak ki communist partiyon jaise kader prashikshan kii aupchaarik vyavastha ke bina bhi
 In the memorable words of French thinker André Mallux, Nehru effectively played the role of 'guru of the Nation' with the empirical knowledge and visionary approach gained from working with Gandhi and other veterans of the freedom movement
 ullekhneey rup se, unhone hindu or muslim sampradayikta donon kaa hi muqabla dharmanirpekshata ke saath nahin, jaisaa ki aamtaur par isaki galat vyakhya ke kaaran samajha jaataa he, balki rashtrawaad ke saath kiya
 Secularism was embedded in Nehru's idea of indian nationalism, and it was certainly not ignorant of or indifferent to the various hurdles of Indian culture
 mahatvapurn yah bhi he ki kader-aadhaarit party nahin hone ke baavjood, haal ke dinon tak jamini str ke rajnatik kaaryakarta ko congress main kabhi bhi nazarandaaj nahin kiya gaya
 This lesson of history underlines the 'what to do and what not' for the Congress today
 peshewaron or technocrates kii sevaaon kaa laabh uthaanaa bhi mahatvapurn he, lekin usase anant guna zyada mahatvapurn he in sevaaon ko ek rajnatik sankalpana ke khaanche main rakhana
 In other words, it is extremely important to give due respect and weight to the insights and attitudes of the regular political worker
 isi prakaar, vibhinn saamaajik samoohon or pahachaanon kii aakankshaon ke prati samvedansheel hona acha he, lekin in sabko ek rashtriya drushtikon or rashtriya aakankshaon main pirone kii chunauti swikaarna zyada phydemand he
 This can only happen if ideological training of the workers and politically aware public is taken seriously and defeat or victory does not back down from that goal
 isko lekar koi bhram nahin hona chahie ki ham bharat ke ateet, vartmaan or bhavishya ke vichaaron kii teevr pratispardhaa ke bich ek saanskrithik yuddh ke madhya khadey hai
 Congress can successfully face this challenge standing in front of its existence only if it is ready to adopt an inclusive and progressive national approach, refine it and establish aggressive dialogue
 purushottam agarwal lekhak or saanskrithik aalochak hai
 His latest book, Who is Bharat Mata, is an edited collection of articles written by Jawaharlal Nehru and on him (speaking Tiger, 2019) *** bhandari ne adaalat se chandra ko offis jane dene kii ijaajat dene kaa aagrah karte hue kaha ki puure vishwa main real state company puunji kho rahi he, lekin keval chandra hi is maamle main jail main band hai

 dhaval kulkarni ne tameem ko dhawan ke haathon kaich karakar bharat ko pehali safalataa dilaai
 India lost the chance of a comeback The fall of the wicket did not show the effect of Bangladesh's run pace and Litan Das (36), who came out to bat at third order, also continued to score fast with Soumya
 donon ne duusare wicket ke liye 62 gendon main 52 ran jode
 Shortly after Ravichandran Ashwin sent Soumya to the pavilion in the 17th over, Litton Das also fell victim to Akshar Patel and it seemed that the Indian team could make a comeback from here

 Narayan Sai, the rape accused and son of Asaram, escaped from the Scorpio by breaking the toll barrier at Khandauli on Yamuna Expressway on Saturday, 30 November
 narayan sai ko pakadaney ke liye mathura police ne teen ghante tak jabardast nakebandi kii
 Raids were conducted in the ashrams of Vrindavan, but Scorpio and Sai were not found anywhere
 shanivaar subah kareeb aath baje yamuna express-ve ke khandauli (agra) toll plaza par ek safed scorpiyo main narayan sai apane do anya saathiyon ke saath police ko dikhaai diya
 Seeing the Agra Police, his Scorpio broke the barrier and ran towards Delhi
 is par mathura police ko alert kar diya gaya
 SSP Gulab Singh blocked all the routes out of the district and searched for Scorpio, but Scorpio had already got out of a cut on the way
 kareeb teen ghante kii karrwai ke baad police ko niraashaa hi haath lagi
 After this, the police got the news that Narayan Sai Rai, a prize of five lakhs, entered Vrindavan from Cuttack and hid in an ashram on Gandhi Marg
 kotwali police ne is par kai ashramon main chaape maare, lekin do ghante kii chaanbin ke baad bhi uske haath khaali hi rahe
 The primary challenge of BJP and Congress is to rely on unexpected regional parties in the southern peninsula
 damdaar kshetreey party ke kandhe par savaar hone kaa yahi nuksaan he
 These parties are in government on their own in two Telugu states
 dramuk, annadramuk, tiares, tidipi, viesarsi, jad (es) samet anek dalon par tiki hai in do rashtriya dalon kii sambhaavnaayentamilnadu main 18 april kaa chunaav sattarudh ol india anna dravid munetra kadgam (annadramuk) or uske pratidwandvi dravid munetra kadgam (dramuk) ke liye ek aitihaasik chunaav hone vaala he
 The results of the by-elections for the Lok Sabha elections, as well as the 18 seats of the 234-seat assembly, can determine the future of the three-year-old AIADMK government
 pichhali loksabhaa main annadramuk ne rajya kii 39 siton main se 37 siten jiti thim or rajya kii sabase badi party ke rup main ubhari thi
 Now the AIADMK and DMK are the two strong leaders respectively
 jayalalita or em
 Karunanidhi has passed away
 donon hi dalon ne apni suvidhanusaar anya kshetreey dalon or rashtriya partiyon—dramuk ne congress ke saath or annadramuk ne bhartiya janata party ke saath gathbandhan kiya he
 As a result, both the main Dravidian parties are now contesting only 20 seats and national parties will take advantage of the vote bank of these Dravidian parties
 is baar chunavi sameekaran uljhe hue dikhaai dete hai
 The AIADMK, which contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections alone, has contested this time with BJP, Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) and Desiya Murupoku Dravida Kadgam (DMDK)
 annadramuk do saal puraani idppadi ke
 Palaniswami is contesting the by-elections in all 18 assembly seats in the state to retain the government

 The challenge of Dinkaran-led Amma Makkal Munnetra Kadagam is also to be faced face-to-face
 jin 18 siton par up chunaav ho rahe hai unamem se 16 siten annadramuk ke bheetar dinakaran ke samarthak vidhayakon ko ayogy tehra die jane ke kaaran khaali hui hai
 But due to the postponement of the by-elections in three other seats, the current effective strength of the members in the Legislative Assembly is 213
 annadramuk ke paas vartmaan main 114 vidhayak hai or use apni sarkaar banaae rakhane ke liye in 18 main se kam se kam do siten jitkar vidhansabha main apana aankada aadhe se adhik yani 116 tak pahunchaana hoga
 Keeping in mind the arithmetic of caste and community, the AIADMK has tied up with the PMK, which holds its own in the Vanniyars
 vah philvakt apane mul vot bank ko lekar utani aashwast nahin dikh rahi
 This is reflected in the aiadmk's hesitation in trying its own strength after long postponing the local civic elections and breaking the party after Dinakaran broke the party
 yahi kaaran he ki isane pashchimi tamilnadu main vot bank ko saadhane ke liye piemke ko saat loksabhaa siton kii peshkash kii he
 However, the aiadmk's alliance with him may be hard to come by, with the pmk's demand for a complete ban on the sale of liquor in the state and bjp's assertion of being a 'fascist party' led by Narendra Modi
 in chunaavon main bhaajapa or congress donon hi 2014 ke mukaable zyada laabh main rah sakati hai
 The BJP won just one Lok Sabha seat in 2014 while the Congress could not even open an account
 bhaajapa apane gathbandhan sahyogiyon kii tulana main kaaphi kam siton par chunaav lard rahi he
 It is contesting only five seats out of 39 in the state, while AIADMK is contesting on 20 seats and PMK on 7 seats
 2014 main bhaajapa piemke ke saath gathbandhan karke annadramuk ke khilaaf chunaav ladi thi
 This time the BJP has also joined the AIADMK in the hope of increasing its number of mps from Tamil Nadu
 saamaajik kshetra kii yojanaon ko lekar annadramuk kaa pradarshan kharaab nahin rahaa he
 However, there are many other issues that can affect the party's prospects
 inamen medical pravesh pariksha main rashtriya paatrata sah pravesh pariksha yaa eniiti ko lagu kiya janaa, pichley saal thuthukudi main sterlite copper factory ke pradarshnakariyon par police kii golibari, jisamen 12 log maare gaye the, kaveri delta main methane ke dohan jaisi pariyojnaon ko rokane kii maang or prastaavit nutrino vedhashala pariyojna jisamen theni jile main ek pahari ke neeche 1,300 meter gahari gupha bananaa shaamil he
 The DMK has stated in its manifesto that it will discontinue the methane and neutrino projects
 dramuk kii koshish rahegi ki vah in muddon ko lekar itnaa joardaar sangharsh kare ki 2021 main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ko samay se kaaphi pehle karana pade
 The party has fielded Karunanidhi's daughter Kanimozhi from Thoothukudi Lok Sabha seat, whose term as a Rajya Sabha member is about to end
 haalanki, dramuk or uske sahyogiyon ke liye chunaav main pramukh chehre ke rup main karunanidhi ke chote bete, em

 There is a possibility of uniting anti-incumbency in such a direct fight, which will naturally benefit the DMK
 stallin ne pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke rup main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke liye apane samarthan kii ghoshnaa karke rajya ke alpsankhyak or dalit voton ko saadhane kii koshish kii he
 DMK strategists say that there is deep dissatisfaction among the state government employees about the AIADMK government
 iskaa arth he ki alpsankhyak or dalit voton ke baad rajya kaa doosraa sabase bada vot bank dramuk ke paksh main lamaband ho saktaa he or ve isse party kii takat main or ijapha hone kii ummiden laga rahe hai

 *** The Supreme Court said in an important judgment on Monday that the Election Commission has the right to investigate allegations of 'paid news'
 yadi kisi ummidavaar ne chunaav ke dauraan namakan daakhil karte vakt apane chunavi kharch main 'ped news' par kharch kii jane vaali rakam kaa zikr nahin kiya he to ayog isaki jaanch kar saktaa he
 a bench of Justices Surinder Singh Nijjar and Justice Fakir Mohammad Ibrahim Kalifulla passed the judgment dismissing the plea of former Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan in this regard
 bench ne dilli hai court ke us faisle ko barkaraar rakhaa, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki yadi koi ummidavaar chunaav ke dauraan namakan daakhil karte vakt apane chunavi kharch main 'ped news' par kharch kii jane vaali rakam kaa zikr nahin karata he to ayog isaki jaanch kar saktaa he
 Chavan challenged this decision of the High Court in the Supreme Court
 supreme court ne kaha ki chunaav ayog pratidin is maamle kii sunwaayee kar 45 dinon ke bheetar is shikaayat kaa nipataara karegaa
 This is the whole case Chavan won the Maharashtra Assembly elections in 2009 from Bhokar seat in Nanded
 unhone 1
 It was won by a margin of 25 lakh votes
 lekin unke vipakshi nirdaleey pratyaashee madhav kinhalakar ne chunaav ayog main ek shikaayat darj kar chavaan par ek marathi dainik main nishchit raashi kaa bhugtan kar 'ashok parv' ke naam se atirikt parishisht chhapavane kaa aarope lagaaya
 The managers of Chavan and the Marathi daily, however, denied it, stating that the addendum was not paid
 nirvachan ayog ne kinhalakar ke aaropon kii jaanch shuru kii, jiske baad chavaan ne varsh 2010 main dilli hai court main yachika daayar kar nirvachan ayog kii jaanch prakriya par roak lagane kii apil kii
 But it was rejected by the Delhi High Court, after which Chavan challenged it in the Supreme Court in November 2011

 Today, 10% of their total sales are happening online, while their firm has also been associated with this medium for 4-5 years

 *** This is called change
 do saal pehle kii baat he
 In May 2012, petrol was priced at 79 per cent against diesel (rs 32 in Delhi
 ) zyada thi
 Today, this gap is just 16 percent
 do saal pehle ke mukaable petrol kii keemat kam hui he, vahiin dijal kii keemat main kam-se-kam 24 fisadi kaa ijapha hua he
 Due to the reduction of subsidy on diesel on 16 September, now its retail business has become a profitable deal
 beete 12 saal main aisa pehali baar hua he
 The administrative pricing system was introduced in India after the first global oil crisis in 1973, since then diesel prices were under government control
 dilachasp baat he ki is ore kisi kaa dhyaan hi nahin gaya ki ganga ulti bah rahi he or garibon par boj or bad gaya he jabaki amir ko phayda mil rahaa he
 Generally this is the claim
 haalanki tathy iske vipareet hai
 The question is also how such a big reform happened with such silence? Cutting diesel subsidy is the most difficult and most silent improvement since 1991
 2011-2012 kii shuruyaat main karon se hone vaali aay kam ho rahi thi lekin kharch or sabsidi kaa boj badhata ja rahaa tha
 Because of this, the fiscal deficit started increasing rapidly
 sone kaa aayaat, kachche tel kii badhati keemat, bijli sanyantron ke liye koyale ke badhate aayaat ke kaaran chaalu khate main ghaataa bhi bad rahaa tha
 Thus, in mid-2012, rating agencies first downgraded India's rating to negative and then warned of further reducing it to "risky or uncertain"
 iskaa nateeja yah rahaa ki videshon se karj lenaa or bhi mahangaa ho gaya
 The huge difference in petrol and diesel prices hurt the automobile market
 esayuvi kaa eendhan scooter ke eendhan ke mukaable sasta ho gaya
 Buyers of petrol cars declined and long queues of buyers for diesel cars began
 in halaat se nibatane ke liye sarkaar ke paas gine-chune upaay hi the, jisamen se ek tha tel par sabsidi ko ghataana
 Many previous governments wanted to bring this reform, but in January 2013, the UPA government took this step
 phir bhi sarkaar dijal kii keemton main har maah nishchit lekin maamuli vrudghi (50 paisa) karne kaa jokhim nahin uthaa saki
 Protests had already started and its impact on inflation was also going to cause concern
 loksabhaa chunaav najadik the, isliye sarkaar ne kadam waapas le liye
 The NDA government had to decide whether the reforms would be taken forward or not
 sarkaar ne sudhaar kii disha main kadam badha die
 The reduction in the price of crude oil and the strengthening of the rupee made it easier to reduce subsidies
 ham ummid kar sakate hai ki ab dijal kii keemat vaishvik keemton ke hisaab se ghatengi-badhengi
 The market price of fuel in India is determined by the average of diesel import and export prices
 petrol kii tarah hi dijal kii keemton ko puri tarah bazaar ke hawaale karnaa ab bhi dur kii kaudi he or sarkaar bhi is disha main badi saavdhaanee se kadam badhanaa chaahati he kyonki kachche tel kii keemten sthir nahin hai
 The next step would be to balance the prices of petrol and diesel
 iske liye kar pranali main bade badlaav karne honge
 At present, the consumer of petrol is about Rs
 10 against diesel
 atirikt kar chukaate hai, isi ke bal par sarkaar rasoi gas or kerosine par sabsidi detii he
 The beginning is good and we should welcome the move
 lekin abhi lanbaa rasta tay karnaa he
 It is everyone's dream to put a red or yellow light on a car or other vehicle, but not everyone can use it legally
 vahiin kai log dusron par rob jhaadne yaa states simbel ke liye apane vaahanon par avaidh rup se laal yaa pili batti laga lete hai
 These days, the people of Madhya Pradesh Police and Transport Department are being rung these days

 The chaotic lifestyle has stressed on the one hand and the unformed body on the other
 aaj ke samay main zyaadaatar log motaape kii chintaa se jujh rahe hai
 There are many reasons for obesity
 kuch log junk food zyada khate hai, kuch niyamit vyaayaam nahin karte hai to kuch main ye heredetry hota he
 But along with all these reasons, one such reason has been found out which is really worrying
 tanaavpurn maahaul membechapan bitaane vaale bacchiyaan aage chalakar moti ho jaati hai
 Such girls who have seen sickness and death in their home, their chances of getting obese grow significantly
 ek nae america shodh ke anusaar, tanaavpurn bachapan, yuvavastha chemotope ke liye jimmedaarhota he
 However, the study also states that this condition only applies to women
 purushon par kisi bhi tarah ke tanaav koi asar nahin padataa he
 Professor Hui Liu of Michigan State University says that this study will help to understand how childhood stress can lead to obesity later
 saath hi ye bhi ki ye paristhiti mahilaon or purushon main alag-alag tarah se asar kyon daalati he
 Researchers checked the data of a national survey

 bachapan ke tanaav se taatpary 16 yaa usase kam umr main mili pariwarik tanaav se he
 Also, financial constraints, divorce, and mental health of none of the parents are also the main causes of obesity
 bado main naukari chali jane, kisi behad khaas kii maut ho jane jaisi baton se stress level bad jaataa he
 The study said that women who have suffered a lot of stress in childhood tend to get fat quicker than women who have received less stress
 liyu ke mutabik, bachapan ek critical samay hota he jab aadaten bananaa shuru hoti hai
 These habits later have a wide impact on the body and mind

 Scientists have already warned that all types of anticonvulsant pills taken through the mouth gradually increase the risk of thrombus formation, which can cause thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in the deep vein of the leg or arm
 pulmonary embolism ke kaaran fefdon main rakt kii aapurti baadhit hoti he or yah sthiti kai baar khatarnaak bhi ho sakati he
 According to the news, a US study claimed that the use of progesterogen hormones doubles the risk of blood clotting when consumed with birth control pills
 yah adhyayan boston uniwarsity skool of medicine ke anusandhankartaaon ne kiya he
 Birth control pills have been on the market for 50 years
 ab unki teesri peedi bhi bazaar main uplabdh he
 In contraceptive advertisements, they are said to be completely safe, but this is not the case
 bazaar main uplabdh goliyon main jo mukhya antar he wo he hormone or uski maatra kaa
 The concept is mainly related to birth control pills that they contain two different hormones
 ek estrogen to doosraa gestagen
 Estrogen has certain side effects
 jisase blad pressure badha saktaa he
 It can alter the blood flow in the body, causing headache and vomiting
 issemhilaon ko chaatimein baari tanaav bhi mahasoos ho saktaa he
 Hormone overdose pills cause more problems
 jabaki kam hormone vaali goliyon semasikdharm aniyamitahone kaa khatra rahata he
 Although it is inconvenient, doctors believe that the loss is relatively negligible
 gestajan group ke bhi hormone vaali goliyon se masikdharm aniyamit ho saktaa he to iskaa maansik prabhaav bhi padataa he
 Also, it affects the color of the skin
 mahilaon ko shuru-shuru main to lagata he ki unhen koi pareshaani nahin he
 But later, the effect of the pill makes her moody
 jabaki teesri peedi kii garbhanirodhak mini pills main keval projestogen varg ke hi hormone hote hai
 This does not cause women to complain of headache and pain in the breast, but these pills can sometimes be fatal
 isse rakt kaa thakka banane kaa khatra unmahilaon se adhik hota he, jo koi garbhanirodhak goli nahin letin
 The latest research is based on more than 1 lakh women regularly consuming birth control pills

 yahaan samasya 2014 aam chunaav main tab shuru hui, jab bhaajapa ne amethi main rahul ke viruddh smriti irani ko utaara
 The new candidate gave a good challenge to the then Congress Vice President and 3 of his wins in 2009
 7 lakh antar ko ghataakar keval ek lakh maton tak laa diya
 This was an eye-opener for the Congress managers, after which they quickly got involved in working to maintain the margin of victory for Rahul
 iske baad sookshm stareey yojana ke tahat 'purva' yani gaanvstar tak tiimon ko bheja gaya or online ap shakti ke jariye lagaataar nigaraanee rakhi gai
 Shakti is an online platform through which the performance of booth level groups across the country is tracked
 amethi main party samanvayakon ne ek vishesh prayaas bhi kiya he, jahaan rahul ko party ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par pesh kiya gaya he
 Apart from reforming the party's system, activists have been asked to ensure a margin of victory of five lakh votes
 sutron kaa kahana he ki tathakthith pratidwandvi samaajawaadee party ke prabhaavshaalee netaaon kii bhi is kaary main madad lee ja rahi he
 The SP-BSP alliance has distanced itself from the Congress in the general election, but Akhilesh Yadav's party SP had a pre-poll alliance with the Congress in the 2017 assembly elections and the ties between the two parties have not completely ended
 sutron kaa kahana he ki uttar pradesh ke varisht congress netaa pramod tiwari kii sapa va basapa ke sthaneey netaaon se rahul ko samarthan dene ke liye kai baar baatcheet hui he
 He also appealed to the party workers to work unitedly for the goal
 rahul ne 2009 main basapa ke ashish shukla ko 3
 Was defeated by 7 lakh votes
 isaki tulana main 2014 main irani ko teen lakh mat mili the
 4 to Rahul Gandhi
 08 lakh mat mili the
 Sources said the difference could be even less, which is causing concern in the Congress party
 2014 main haar ke baavjood apane pradarshan se utsahit irani tabase lagaataar amethi kaa daura kar rahi hai or is pratishthit seat par kabja jamaane ke liye kaaphi mehnat kar rahi hai jahaan kai unhen abhi bhi 'bahari' kii tarah maanate hai
 Congress MLC Deepak Singh said, "amethi is like a second home for the Gandhi family
 ham rahulji ke liye jeet kaa bada antar sunishchit karenge
 " pakistan main buudhvaar ko teen aatankwaadiyon ko faansee de di gai jinhen sainya adaalat ne 2014 main peshawar hawaondde par hue hamale sahit vibhinn aatanki hamalon main doshi tehraaya tha
 The Pakistani military said in a statement that three militants were hanged in a prison in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which was convicted by a military court

 The hanged terrorists include Sajid, Behram and Fazal A

 The military courts were further restored for two years in March
 inkaa praarambhik do varshiya kaarykaal janvari main samaapt ho gaya tha
 These courts were established in December 2014 after a terrorist attack on an army-run school in Peshawar through a constitutional amendment

 According to the human rights group Justice Project Pakistan, 441 people have been hanged since the Peshawar attack

 pranab mukherjee ke liye 13 kaa ank bhaagyashaalee he
 However, according to popular belief, 13 is not considered auspicious
 pranab mukherjee dilli main 13, talkatoraa road par rahete hai or unka desh kaa 13waan raashtrapati bananaa tay he

 On September 17, the Union Cabinet brought an ordinance banning electronic cigarettes across the country
 is pratibandh ke tahat ab desh main na to i-cigarette bikegi, na banegi, na kharidi jaaegi, na store kii jaaegi, na aayaat hogi, na niryaat hogi or iskaa prachaar bhi nahin hoga
 All products other than e-cigarettes are covered under the Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS)
 jaise- veps, i-hukka yaa i-cigar
 The first person who breaks this rule can be imprisoned for one year, a fine of Rs 1 lakh or both
 iske baad dobaaraa niyam todate pakade jane par 5 lakh jurmaana, teen saal kii jail yaa donon kii sajaa mil sakati he
 Those who store these products can face a jail term of 6 months or a fine of 55 thousand rupees or both
 kya he i-cigarette?i-cigarette bydaree par chalane vaali cigarette he
 In which the solution of nicotine is heated and passes into the lungs of the drinker as steam
 bhaap aadhaarit nicotine utpaada ENDS ke tahat aate hai
 E-cigarettes and other products under ENDS like cigars etc
 do not look like traditional cigarettes and cigars, but sometimes they look like pen or USB drives
 bharat main ENDS utpaadon ko banane or bechney vaali companiyon kaa daawa tha ki unke utpaada paaramparik utpaadon ke badale kam hanikaarak hai
 Size of e-cigarette market in India E-cigarette market in India was still small, but it was expected to grow very fast
 2017 main iskaa desh main i-cigarette kaa bazaar kareeb 107 karod kaa tha
 But it was expected that by 2022 it will increase by 60 per cent
 presient and stretic intelligence ke adhyayan ke anusaar 2024 tak bharat main i-cigarette kii bazaar badhkar 322
 54 crores
 bharat main i-cigarette kaa bazaar har saal 26
 Was growing at a rate of 4 per cent
 i-cigarette ENDS utpaadon main aane vaala sabase kaaman utpaada he
 It has more than 460 brands and more than 7700 flavors in India
 2016-17 se lekar 2018-19 ke bich ENDS utpaada, i-cigarette or iske essessories kaa 119 fisadi niryaat kiya gaya he
 Why did the government want to ban e-cigarettes? The Ministry of Health and the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization have tried to ban such products in the past, which are harmful to the health of common citizens
 is pratibandh vaale adhyadesh se pehle sarkaar is baat se pareshaan thi ki ENDS ke tahat aane vaale utpaada desh ke kanoon ke mutabik drugs kii paribhaasha main nahin aate the
 So legal hurdles were coming
 swasthya mantralay ke sutron ke anusaar in utpaadon kii kabhi suraksha jaanch nahin kii gai
 Neither did they get approval under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940
 isiilie, ye deshbhar main aam logon ke liye aasaani se uplabdh the
 Some smokers even go on to say that they are using ENDS products to give up traditional addiction
 lekin, sarkaar ke mutabik nicotine ke seven ko lekar desh main koi badlaav nahin aayaa
 In May 2019, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) released a white paper, stating that the use of ENDS products is degrading DNA
 cancer ho rahaa he
 Cellular, molecular and immunological toxicity is increasing
 fefde, dil or neurological samasyaayein ho rahi he
 Also, the baby growing in the womb also has an effect
 is pratibandh se kise hoga phaaydasarkaar kaa maananaa he ki is pratibandh se yuvaaon, kishoron or bacchon kii sehat thik rahegi
 Also, the habit of e-cigarettes will end
 nae adhyadesh se desh main tambaakoo kaa upyog kam hoga
 This will benefit financially and reduce diseases
 vahiin, duusari taraf paaramparik tambaakoo utpaada banane vaali companiyon kaa maananaa he ki is faisle se unhen paisa kamaane main thodaa phayda ho saktaa he
 Shares of companies such as ITC, VST, Golden Tobacco and Godfrey Philips India gained 9 percent on Wednesday
 ye companiyaan bhi i-cigarette banaati hai
 If we look carefully at the share holdings of these companies, it is known that the government will also benefit from this decision
 kyonki, sarkaar or rajya sarkaron dwaara chalaai jane vaali companiyon ne buudhvaar ko kareeb 1000 karod rupye kaa laabh kamaaya he
 This means traditional tobacco products are safe
 
 
 naheemparamparik tambaakoo utpaada jaise aam cigarette or kheni pehle se hi khatarnaak bataae ja chuke hai
 According to the American body CDC, cigarette smoking causes damage to every part of the body
 kai bimaariyaan hoti hai
 According to The Lancet, these tobacco products are the leading cause of cancer in India in 2016
 ICMR ke anusaar 2020 tak bharat main har saal cancer ke 17 lakh nae maamle saamne aaenge
 Of these, about 8 lakh will die
 bharat main kareeb 27 karod log tambaakoo utpaadon kaa upyog karte hai
 In addition, the number of passive smokers will increase
 WHO ke mutabik, puure desh main 10 lakh logon kii maut tambaakoo utpaadon kii vajah se hoti he
 What is the condition of the rest of the countries regarding e-cigarettes: People in the world who use the most smokeless tobacco and steam based products live in the world
 kareeb 400 logon ke biimaar padane or 6 logon kii maut hone kii khabar ai he
 The US government has decided to ban many ENDS products, including e-cigarettes
 lekin, tambaakoo utpaadon par pratibandh nahin lagegaa
 UK: The government here says that the ENDS products here are safe
 america main iskaa upyog ghar main bane vaper or liquid se hota he
 Therefore, there is a preparation to ban them
 euke kii sarkaar ne 2016 main i-cigarette par kanoon lekar ai thi
 China: China is the third largest country in the world in terms of number of smokers
 yahaan kishor badi teji se i-cigarette kii ore bad rahe hai
 France: E-cigarettes are sold as medicines or household products
 lekin, ye utpaada banane vaali companiyaan yah daawa karen ki ve sabhi standard ko follow karti hai
 Here too, the government has made a law on e-cigarettes

 Therefore it is important that a better solution to the problem related to hair is found

 Despite this, he continued to follow me on Twitter and after that he said stop following him (meher) as well

 america ke raashtrapati baraak obama colorado rajya main oroda shahar ke cinemaghar main shuukravaar ko hui golibari ke ghatnasthal kaa daura karenge or peedit pariwaron se bhi milenge

 The statement issued by the White House said that the President would meet the injured as well as the bereaved family and Aurora officials

 kisi ke saath relationships main hona ek sukhad anubhuti kaa ehsaas karaata he lekin jab yahi rishta tuutata he to kaaphi takalif bhi hoti he
 If you too are facing a similar situation then this time is definitely painful for you
 kisi ke saath pyaar bhare rishte main rahane ke baad achaanak se jab yah tuutata he to aisa lagata he ki sari duniya hi khatm ho gai or ab jeene kaa koi makasad nahin rahaa he
 But if the experts agree, there are two points of view of everything
 ek wo jo hamen avsaad kaa shikaar bana detaa he or doosraa wo jise apanaakar ham nai jindagi shuru kar sakate hai
 In such a situation, it is advisable that we choose the path which is full of light
 ek baar jab aap puraani baton ko bhulaakar aage badhane kaa faisla kar lete hai to nakraatmakataa peeche chhot jaati he or aapako aisa lagane lagata he ki shaayad jo hua, achche ke liye hi hua
 Psychologists believe that with every breakup you get to learn something new
 par agar aap bahut zyada samvedansheel hai to pehle se hi saavdhaan rahen or apane har kadam ko soch-samajhakar hi uthaaen
 So friends, if your heart is broken too, this is not the time to cry, but to stand firmly
 aapako yah sochane kii jarurat he ki bhale hi aapaki jindagi main dukhad mode aayaa he lekin kaaphi kuch aisa bhi he jo aapke paksh main he
 Every moment of life teaches us something or the other, and if you are standing at such a point of life, then it is very important for you to know and adopt these things
 1
 Being alone is not that bad, if your girlfriend has cheated on you and hundreds of things related to that relationship are uproar in your mind then you need to move on from them
 aapako yah samajhane kii jarurat he ki kisi bure rishte main rahane se lakh guna behatar he ki aap akele rahen
 You can be happy even when you are alone and you may find yourself a better friend
 2
 Listening to the advice of others is also beneficial
 Once a breakup occurs, people often start reminding themselves of their friends and relatives
 unhen yaad aane lagata he ki unke in doston ne unhen is relation main na padane ko kaha tha
 Well now that was to be done
 aage se yah jarur dhyaan rakhen ki salaah sunne main koi harj nahin or agar aapako koi kuch samajha rahaa he to sambhav he ki ek baar aap bhi us disha main jaakar sochen
 3
 aapako isse behatar mil saktaa thedgar aapkaa dil tukade-tukade ho chukaa he to khud ko yah yaad dilaane kii jarurat he ki jindagi yaheen khatm nahin hoti
 There is a lot to do in life
 kisi bhi mode se ek nai shuruyaat kii ja sakati he
 4
 agali baar ke liye abhi se ho jaaen saavdhaanap maane yaa na maane lekin aapkaa rishta achaanak se is mode par nahin aa gaya hoga
 You may have already started getting signs of this, but you would not have noticed
 aise main yah kasam kha len ki aage agar aap kisi relation main padenge to in baton ko jarur dhyaan main rakhenge

 Finally, Castro agreed to take a question from the reporters
 shityudh ke daur se ek-duusare ke dushman bane hue in deshon ke bich maujuud bahut se antaron main se ek bada antar media kii mukharata bhi he
 In a joint press conference, 84-year-old Castro asked in response to the question, "what did you say about political prisoners?" Can you repeat the question asked about political prisoners? '' obama or kastro somvaar ko america or cuba ke sambandhon ke ek nae daur main baat kar rahe the, lekin is sanyukt sammelan ke dauraan do samskritiyon, do raajnneetik vyavasthaaon or do pidiyon kaa takaraav kai baar dekhne ko mila

 Castro also announced to work on "things that bring the two countries closer", acknowledging the "deep differences between the two countries are not ending"
 cuba ke raashtrapati ne haalanki jor diya ki donon deshon ke bich lambey samay se bani hui katutaa kaa adhyay samaapt karne ke liye america dwaara lambey samay se lagaae hue aarthik pratibandh evam guantnamo cuba ko waapas karnaa uski sharten hai
 Earlier, Obama met Castro for only the third time in a formal meeting
 vah aise pehle america raashtrapati hai jo 1928 ke baad pehali baar cuba pahunche hai
 The comments pales of revolution main sena ke ek band ne obama kaa swaagat kiya

 is kranti ne cuba ko ek samyavaadee desh bana diya tha
 Faced with pressure to show positive results to end the bitter standoff between the two countries in the US for more than half a century, Obama then sat down for discussion with Castro against the backdrop of the two countries' flags
 america ne ab tak cuba ke khilaaf lagaae gaye aarthik pratibandh puri tarah nahin hataae hai or cuba main ab bhi kai buniyadi swatantraaaon par roak lagi hui he
 But despite these differences, the two leaders said they were ready to end the Cold War conflict
 ant main kastro patrakaron kaa ek sawaal lene ke liye raji ho gaye
 One of the major differences between these countries, which remained enemies of each other since the era of the Cold War, is the loudness of the media
