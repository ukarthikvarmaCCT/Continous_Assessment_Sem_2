 According to astrology experts, the fast of Karvachauth can improve the life of every Suhagin, but for this it is very important to take care of the rules and precautions related to this divine fast
 karwachouth ke vrath or pujan kii sahi vidhi se is vrath kaa 100 guna fal milegaa
 During the worship of this fast, it is also very important to read the fast story
 karvaa chouth kii prachlit vrath kathapracheen kaal main ek brahman tha
 He had four boys and a quality girl
 ek baar ladki maayke main thi, tabakarvaa chouth kaa vratapada
 The Brahmin's daughter spent the entire day nirjala while performing the fast methodically
 is baat se uske chaaron bhai pareshaan the ki bahan ko pyaas lagi hogi, bhukh lagi hogi, par bahan chandroday ke baad hi jal grahan karegi
 The brothers could not keep up, they showed the sister a false moonlight as soon as evening
 ek bhai pipal ke ped par chalni lekar chadh gaya or deepak jalaakar chalni se roshni utpann kar di
 Then the other brother gave a voice to the sister from below- Look sister, the moon has come out, worship and take food
 bahan ne chand kaa arghya dekar bhojan grahan kar liya
 As soon as receiving food, news of her husband's death came and she mourned hearing this, when Rani Indrani was leaving from there
 unase uskaa dukh na dekha gaya
 The Brahmin girl grabbed his leg and asked the reason for his grief, then Indrani said - You broke the fast of Chauth without having a moon sighting, so you got this pain
 ab tum varsh bhar kichouth kaa vrataniyampurvak karnaa to tera pati jivit ho jayega
 She fasted according to Indrani's saying, then she again got lucky
 isliye prayek stri ko apane pati kii dderghaayu ke liye yah vrath karnaa chahie
 According to the second story of Karvachauth, when the Pandavas were wandering one-by-one, Lord Krishna told Draupadi about this divine fast
 isi vrath ke pratap se draupadi ne apnesuhag kii lambii umraka vardaan paaya tha
 Draupadi did this fast and Arjuna returned back after receiving the desired fruit
 tabhi se apane akhand suhaag ke liye hindu mahilaayein karvaa chouth vrath karti hai
 Third Story: The fast of Karvachauth is also associated with the story of Satyavan and Savitri
 is katha ke anusaar jab yamraj satyawan kii aatma ko lene aae, to savitri ne khaanaa-pinaa sab tyaag diya
 In front of his stubbornness, Yamraj had to bow down and he returned the life of Satyavan
 chauthi kathathek samay kii baat he ki ek karvaa naam kii pativrata stri apane pati ke saath nadi ke kinare ke gaanv main rahati thi
 One day her husband went to bathe in the river
 snaan karte samay vahaan ek magar ne uskaa pair pakad liya
 The man started calling his wife by saying Karva Karva Karva Karva
 uski aawaaj sunakar uski patni karvaa bhaagi chali ai or aakar magar ko kachche dhaage se baandh diya
 After tying the crocodile, she reached Yamraj and started saying to Yamraj, 'O God! But my husband has caught my leg
 us magar ko narak main le jaao
 'yamraj said,' yet the manger is still alive, so i cannot kill him
 ’ is par karvaa boli, ‘agar aap aisa nahin karoge to main aap ko shraap dekar nasht kar duungi
 Hearing this, Yamraj was frightened and came with that loving husband Karva and sent Magar to Yampuri and gave longevity to Karva's husband

 Because of the good weather in India, every year thousands of migrants come to the Marine Drive and Girgaon Chowpatty area

 He said that people bring 5 to 10 kg of snacks with them and feed these birds
 isse na keval unki sehat kharaab ho rahi he, balki unke khaane kii aadat bhi badal rahihe
 According to bird experts, this is not only deteriorating the digestive system of birds, but will also affect their fertility in the coming days

 Eating fish gives him high protein and omega 3 fatty acids
 jabaki in pakshiyon ko mil rahi namakeen main fat, namak or soda hota he, jo insaanon ke saath pakshiyon ko bhi nuksaan pahunchaata he
 These sparrows have to fly thousands of kilometers to come to India and go from here, but by eating salty, their liver becomes fatty, cholesterol increases in their body

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said that India wants to resolve all pending issues with Pakistan through dialogue for 'peace and prosperity of its people'
 unhone america jhukaav ke sanket ko bhi yah kehete hue khaarij kar diya ki ek duusare par nirbharta vaali is duniya main bharat apane samgr rashtriya hit main america, rus or china jaisi sabhi pramukh shaktiyon ke saath madhur sambandh chahta he
 In an interview with Malaysian newspaper 'new Straits Times', Singh said,' India is committed to resolving all pending issues with Pakistan through dialogue in the interest of peace and prosperity of its people
 ’bhutan main dakshes sammelan ke avasar par pakistan ke pradhanmantri usoof raja gilaani ke saath apni bhent ko yaad karte hue unhone kaha ki donon ne apane apane videsh mantriyon or videsh sachivon ko vishwaas bahaali or paraspar sarokaar ke sabhi muddon par sarabhoot baatcheet kaa maarg prashast karne ke liye taur tareeke taiyaar karne kii jimmedaari saunpi thi
 He said this when asked if he is seeing a significant reduction in tension between the two nuclear-powered countries in the near future
 yah saakshaatkaar unki malaysia yatra se pehle new street times ke saath hua he
 When Singh was asked that India had been the prime advocate of the Nirgut movement, has there been any change in his international relations due to his inclination towards America, he said, 'we are not leaning in any direction
 bharat kii videsh niti hamaare suvichaarit raashtra hit kii abhivyakti he
 'he said,' In the globalized world in which we live, inter-relationship and inter-dependence have increased considerably
 atev ham sabhi pramukh mahashaktiyon-america, rus, china, japan ke saath madhur sambandh chaahate hai
 When asked about the state of the international global economy, the Prime Minister said that it is not in a truly good state and there are uncertainties in the horizon
 unhone kaha, ‘atev jin uddeshyon ke saath ji-20 hui, mujhe lagata he unhen saakaar karne ke liye kaaphi kuch kiya jane kii jarurat he
 He said that reforms in international financial organizations need to be pursued at a rapid pace
 dilli uniwarsity kii lau faikalti me admician ke liye chune gaye kareeb 800 students kaa admician adhar me latak gaya he
 The reason for this is the report of the Bar Council of India which has asked to close the evening classes of Delhi University
 student ne kiya kadaa virodhaj badi sankhya main tamaam students hai court ke baahar ikattha hue jinako abhi bhi uniwarsity ne yah saaf- saaf nahin batya he ki admician kii kol aane ke baad bhi unka admician is satr main hoga yaa nahin
 Actually till last year, about 2300 law students were given admission in Delhi University Law Faculty
 is baar bhi admician kii prakriya puri karne ke baad uniwarsity ne 2300 students ko chun liya
 But the Bar Council report recommends that only 1500 students can be taught in the infrastructure that is currently available with the Law Faculty
 isliye evening classes ko band kar diya jaae
 May have to fill 30 million penalty Council has made it clear that Delhi University is not following the rules of Legal Education Rule 2008
 lihaaza 2011 se ab tak 2016 kaa wo niyam paalan na karne kaa 30 lakh kaa jurmaana bhi bhare
 Future of 800 students in danger Among these things, the future of those 800 students has been endangered, who had confirmed their seats to study in law faculty here
 lekin ab yahaan admician na milane ke baad unke paas is saal raste band ho gaye hai kyonki baaki uniwarsity ke yahaan bhi admician kii prakriya khatm ho chuki he or privet uniwarsity kii fees itani zyaada he ki waha admician lenaa sabake bas kii baat nahin he
 So these students are now considering options for legal battle
 abhi tak dilli uniwarsity ne bhi koi notification jari nahin kiya he
 Hence, the students' dilemma has increased further
 dilli uniwarsity ke paas nai building me evening classes karaane kaa vikalp he lekin ye is satr main karnaa bhi aasaan kaam nahin he kyonki uske liye kai tarah kii NOC kii zarurat hoti he
 Perhaps a solution can be found in this case after the intervention of the court

 aaj Quit India movement ke 75 saal puure ho gaye hai

 On August 8, 1942, the All India Congress General Assembly passed this resolution at the Gowalia Tank Grounds in Bombay, and the whole country jumped into the 'quit India' movement
 jis Quit India slogan par puraa desh ekajute ho gaya tha, aakhir wo slogan kisne diya tha
 The world knows that this slogan belonged to Mahatma Gandhi, but historians do not agree to it
 kahaan se aayaa slogamedia reports ke anusaar, Quit India ke slogan ko likhane kaa shrey congress netaa yusuf mehrali ko jaataa he
 It is said that he was very close to Gandhiji and he met Gandhiji shortly before starting this movement and suggested this slogan to him

 One of them suggested 'get out'
 Gandhi rejected it as being impolite
 Rajagopalachari mentioned 'retreat' or 'withdraw'
 That too did not find favour
 Yusuf Meherali presented Gandhi with a bow bearing the inscription 'quit India'
 Gandhi said in approval, ‘amen’
 GG Parikh, one of the co-founders of Yusuf Mehrali Center, says that Yusuf ji had printed several badges written on QUIT INDIA before 7 August 1942

 Kangana and Hrithik's war, which has become the biggest war of Bollywood, so far only the lawyers of both sides are handling the case
 shuruyaat main bhale hi rithik ne kangana ke sili eks kahe jane ke jawaab main kuch ek twit kiye the lekin baad main yah maamla kanoonee jang main tabadil ho gaya
 In the past too, there has been a lot of collision between the stars in the past due to their relationship and other reasons, but no one will be unaware of the fact that this battle has taken place between Kangana and Hrithikki
 haal hi main yah khabaren ain hai rithak or kangana bhi ab is ladaai se khij chake hai isliye unhone is jang ko khatm karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Whether there is any specific conclusion of the dispute of this pair, but one thing is certain that kangana-hrithik's history will be remembered for a long time in the history of Bollywood Fights
 rithik-kangana controvarsi: 5 aisi baaten jo kangana kaa paksh majboot karti hankehan se shuru hua maamla:kangana ne pinkavila ko ek intervyuu dete hue'sili eks' shabd kaa istemaalakia tha
 Actually, some time back news came that Kangana was removed from the film 'aashiqui 3' only on Hrithik's suggestion
 jab kangana se is bare main sawaal kiya gaya to unhone kaha tha, 'mujhe kai ajeeb afvaahen sunne ko mil rahi hai
 Even a guesser can guess where these rumors are coming from? i do not know why the Xs do such crazy things to get your attention
 meri taraf se ye chapter khatm ho chukaa he or ab main un baton kii kabr khodna nahin chaahati
 'right after this, the tweet said that the women with whom the media is referring to my relationship are more likely to have a relationship with a pope
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki kangana ne rithik kaa ek baar bhi naam nahin liya phir unhen itani mirchi kyon lagi
 By the way, there are 5 things in this case that Kangana's pan seems to be heavier - 1
 bollywood actor rithik apni image ko lekar kuch zyada hi contious hai
 Even if the mistake is his, but he always makes every effort to prove himself right
 kangana hi nahin pehali patni sujain ke saath alag hone kaa elaan karte vakt bhi rithik ne sujain ke upar hi rishte ko khatm karne kaa dosha madha tha
 Not only this, a statement was issued to Suzanne giving the real reason for the rift in the relationship, on which Suzanne was very angry
 2
 Hrithik sent a notice to Kangana in February for an unconditional apology for the Silly Ax statement
 iske baad kangana ne palatwaar karte hue notice bheja ki unhone yah nahin kaha tha ki sili eks rithik hai
 Now when Kangana had the title of Silly X, it is not clear, then how Hrithik himself accepted himself as his X
 3
 In his notice, Hrithik has emphasized that he has worked in two films with Kangana
 unka kahana he ki peshewar rishton ke alaava unke bich soshal, personal yaa kisi bhi tarah kaa koi intimet relation nahin he
 The thinking is that when Kangana did not comment about their relationship, then why did Hrithik explain about it? 4
 It is well known that of the two, it is Kangana who is seen talking openly about their relationship or any matter
 lekin rithik, filmein hon yaa phir personal life, hameshaa in sab par koi bhi statement dete vakt asahaj hi najar aate hai
 This is the reason that when Hrithik asked Kangna to apologize, Kangana gave a clear answer that if he wants to do this then he will have to make his point known because i don't mind blackmailing and threats
 5
 Kangana is not only a queen in films but in real life too
 kangana ke paksh main ek or baat jaati he ki unke paas khone ke liye kuch nahin he
 Whether it is real life or reel life, Kangana never worries about her image
 na to unhen is baat kaa dar he ki is controvarsi ke chalate unhen filmein nahin milengi or na hi vah sochati hai ki unka parivaar or unke phans kya sochenge
 Read here: Why Hrithik seems innocent in this case Kangana, Hrithik Legal War: told each other mentally ill, Kangana sent 1439 e-mail forensic report gave clean chit to Hrithik, Kangana allegations wrong: Kangana's allegations in this battle initially Kaitra's face looked heavy but later Hrithik also did not delay in getting a clean chit for the released mails
 rithik se jude ek sutara ne bataaya ki kangana ne jo apana i-mail acount hack hone kii baat kahi thi vah jhooth he
 This was also proved by a forensic report
 rithik-kangana vivaad main ek forensik sartificate saamne aayaa he
 It says that Hrithik never tried to hack Kangana's e-mail account
 photo kaa kya he sach:is maamle main rithik sang apane rishte kii sachai bataane ke liye kangana kii ore se rithik sang donon kii karibiyon ko bayaan karte hue kuch tasviren jari kii gayi
 But just a day after Kangana's photo release, Hrithik's team Nedanadan shot several photos
 rithik kii team ne in tasveeron ke jariye yah sabit karne kii koshish kii he ki jis party or photo ko lekar rithik-kangana ke bich kisi rishte kii afvaah failaai ja rahi he, vah galat he
 Through the photos released, it is clear that Suzanne was also present in the party where Hrithik and Kangana's photo was taken
 rithik ne safai ke taur par pesh kii tasvirenrithik ne in tasveeron ko li kar yah bataaya ja rahaa he ki kangana ke saath rithik kaa koi antarang sambandh nahin he
 The kind of pose Hrithik gave with Kangana, also with the rest of the people who were in the party during that time
 haal main rithik-kangana kii ek tasviir saamne ai thi, jiske aadhaar donon ke bich afaire hone kii baat kahi ja rahi thi
 Hrithik's refusal to talk about the affair, Kangana's lawyer had said on the earlier picture that there is some connection between Hrithik and Kangana and only Hrithik's claim of having a professional relationship is wrong
 gauratlab he ki yah tasviir krish film ke relies hone se pehle ek party ke dauraan lee gai thi
 Therefore, Hrithik was also being questioned
 rithik kisi tarah ke afaire kii baat se inkaar karte hai, jabaki kangana ranot kaa paksh doosraa hi he
 In defense of Hrithik, his ex wife Suzanne shared a picture of Kangana doing black magic in Kangana Hrithik's War: Her ex boyfriend studies Suman, who worked with Kangana in 'raj 2', made shocking revelations about Kangana
 adhyayan ne yah sab bataaya he kangana ke bare main -kangana kaa asli cheharaa sabake saamne aana chahiehaal hi main adhyayan ne diene ko die gaye intervyuu main kangana ke vyaktitv ke bare main kai bhayanak raaj khole hai
 The study, while favoring Hrithik in the hrithik-kangna controversy, has told the newspaper that he can understand his pain better because he too has gone through it
 adhyayan ne spasht kaha ki kangana ke bare main yah unka aakhri intervyuu he
 In this, he told, 'I want people to know the truth
 main kangana ke kariyar ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaana chahta lekin vah kisi or ko apana nishaanaa banaakar maasoom kaise ban sakati hai
 Kangana has tried to hurt her career by spreading false things about many people earlier
 'kaala jaadu karti thim kangangadhyayan nekanganake bare main ek or bada khulaasa karte hue kaha ki vah kaala jaadu karti thim
 He told, 'when i was with Kangana, she took me to an astrologer named Pallavi
 usne bataaya ki meraa samay sahi nahin chal rahaa he or ise sudhaarney ke liye mujhepuja kerani hogi
 For this Kangana called me to her house at 12 o'clock at night
 kangana ke apartment main ek guest room he
 He covered that guest room completely with black cloth and there were many idols of God there
 tabhi kangana ne mujhe us kamare band kar diya or kuch mantron ko padhane ke liye kaha
 i was very scared and i said without reading the mantra that i read the mantra
 iske kuch din baat jyotishi pallavi se mujhe raat ko 12 baje shamshaan ghat main jaakar kuch chizon ko phenkane ke liye bolaa
 i was shocked to hear this and i did not do so
 'pandit ne bataaya, kangana pilaati thi khoonakanganake bare main is khulaase ke saath adhyayan ne kaha ki vah metro city main paley-bade the or in sab chizon ke bare main nahin jaanate the
 He was scared of all this and met a tarot card reader in this regard
 adhyayan ne kaha, 'is tero card reader ne kaha ki mere saath kuch bahut bura hone vaala he kyonki mujh par koi pahari jaadu kiya gaya he
 Then i realized that among my acquaintances, only Kangana is from Himachal
 maine is bare main apni maa ko bataaya jab unhone hamaare parivaar ke pandit se is bare main baat kii
 'the study says that this pandit has given me a surprising thing
 unhone mujhase poocha tha ki kya kangana tumhen apane haath kaa bana khaanaa khilaati hai
 On my acceptance of this, he said that she gives you your unclean blood by mixing it in food
 haalanki tab maine is baat ko nazarandaaj kar diya
 But after a few days, there was a lot of conflict and fighting in our relationship
 adhyayan kaa kahana he ki tab vah puraa din rote rahete or puraa din sharaab ke nashe main duube rahete the
 His condition was such that he could even die then
 gaali galoch or marpet karti thim kanganarithik roshan ke saathkanganaki karibiyon ke bare main adhyayan ne bataaya, 'film 'kits' kii shooting ke dauraan kangana kaa rithik ke saath mail-jol badha
 He also called Kangana and me in his party
 lekin us party main main kangana kaa vyavhaar dekhakar hairaan tha
 They told me that someone is teasing them
 maine unase party chhodkar chalane ko kaha to vah mujhe intjaar karne ko kahkar kahin chali gai
 i sat there for a long time and after that she suddenly came and then asked the party to go immediately
 'lekin aisa nahin tha ki ve donon aaraam se party se nikal gaye
 The study revealed that Kangana got a slap on her as soon as she came down the stairs and it was so strong that her tears came out
 adhyayan ke anusaar, jaise hi ham gaadi main baithe, kangana ne mujhe dobaaraa peetna shuru kar diya
 i asked the driver to stop the car and came out of the car
 vakt main bich sadak par khadaa ro rahaa tha
 i can never forget that night of my life
 aisi or ghatnaayen hai jab kangana ne vyavhaar se main behad shocked tha
 Let us tell you that the study of the behavior of abusive and abusive speech was also mentioned in an interview earlier
 adhyayan ke khulaase par kangana ne nahin balki phans ne diya is andaaj main jawaab:adhyayan dwaara kangana par kaala jaadu karne, maar meet or gaali galoch karne ke araape ke baad khud hi apana majaak bana baithe hai
 Stating that these studies of Twitter were baseless, Twitter users have turned this serious issue towards comedy by making many funny tweets
 aaie dekhen adhyayan ke khulaason partwitor parakaise chutki lee ja rahi he:1

 Recently, the mail of Kangana and Hrithik for another chatting is becoming very viral on social media
 is chat main kangana rithik se kya kah rahi hai aap khud hi pard lijie: Actually, a company in Delhi was given the contract to install the CNG kit, but it got many flaws
 bina tender ke theka diya gaya
 The government was spending in this and the company was taking the revenue

 The CBI investigated and gave its report to the Delhi government
 lekin uske baavjood uparajyapal ne dilli anti karpshan branch ko maamla darj karne kii anumati nahin di thi
 However, despite the investigation by the CBI and the investigation of the Anti Corruption Branch, the big fish of this scam could not be tightened

 Union Sports Minister MS Gill said on Tuesday that the doping convicts will not be spared as we want medals in the Commonwealth Games but with respect
 gil ne yah baat yuva or khel maamalon ke prantiy mantriyon ke sammelan ke maukey par samvaadadaataaon se kahi
 He said, 'we want to give this message to the players that we want to win the medal with honor
 hamen ummid he ki yah maamla jaldi nipat jaayegaa or doshiyon ko katai bakhsha nahin jaayegaa
 Gill also asked sports federations to educate their players in this matter
 unhone kaha, ‘khel mantralay to prayaas karegaa hi lekin khel mahasanghon ko bhi chaiye ki ve apane khilaadiyon ko jaagruk banaaye taaki aisi ghatnayen phir naa ho
 Regarding the preparations for the Commonwealth Games, Gill said that the incessant rains in the capital had affected the preparations for the opening and closing ceremonies at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium

Sibal said that the BJP is worried because its leaders know that once the commission is set up, Narendra Modi will have no way to escape

 As cliched as it may sound, my mother is my # girlhero
 She is a fiesty woman that came from a small town, who ran away from home to pursue her dream job
 
 
 she was a doctor in the armed forces, has over 8 different medical certifications, is a certified pilot and she speaks 9 languages! She also used to drive around in an open top jeep (what a badass!), Whew! She's also an amazing mother, daughter, sister, wife, business partner
 
 
 She's the one who taught me that i could be anything and everything i want to be
 
 
 And that's why she's my # girlhero
 
 
 It's so important to inculcate that sense of confidence in the girls around you and hopefully that's what we do this International Day of the Girl Child

 Many important 2002 records related to the Gujarat riots have been destroyed
 nanaavati ayog kii sunwaayee ke dauraan gujarat sarkaar ne yah baat maani he
 This point came to light when IPS officer Sanjeev Bhatt appeared before the Nanavati Commission investigating the Gujarat riots
 sunwaayee ke dauraan gujarat sarkaar ne khud yah mana ki police ke phone kol or log book gaayab hai
 Gujarat government lawyer SB Vakil says all those records have been destroyed in 2007
 lekin cese se jude logon kaa kahana he ki abhi to 2002 ke dangon kii jaanch chal rahi he or isse jaanch par kaaphi bura asar padegaa
 This will also prevent the Supreme Court from reaching the bottom of the riots
 kaha ja rahaa he ki vahi records cese main ahm saboot ban sakate the
 Jana Sangh Manch's lawyer Mukul Sinha says that when all the legal proceedings are going on and it is illegal to destroy the records
 ab chaaron ore yah prashn he ki kya yah records jaanboojhkar nasht karwaae gaye yaa prakriya kaa hissaa maatr tha
 The Yale School of Management is going to place its dean's position after pepsico's Indian-origin chief executive Indira Nooyi
 or isaki ek khaas vajah bhi he
 Let me tell you that Indira has studied from this renowned institute and recently she has donated an undisclosed amount to this institute and after this she has become the alumnus contributing the most amount here
 iske alaava, vah aisi pehali mahila hai jinhone is sheersh prabandhan santhaan ke dean pad ke liye daan diya he
 Yale did not disclose the amount donated by Nooyi but said that she has become the 'most generous graduate' of the Yale School of Management in view of the institution's dean for the post of dean and the introduction of a new fund
 santhaan ne ek bayaan main kaha, vah sheersh prabandhan santhaan main dean ke pad ke liye daan karne vaali pehali mahila hai

 nui ne kaha he ki santhaan ke anubhav ne hameshaa ke liye unke jivan kii disha badal di

 Pakistan is not infamous for terrorists in the name of heaven
 akele is mulk main 70 hazaar se zyaada log sirf aatankwaadi hamalon main maare ja chuke hai
 For these conditions, the rulers of Pakistan may find millions of excuses, but the fact is that Pakistan has never been serious about ending terrorism
 balki wo to aatankwaad ko khuleam badhaava detaa rahaa he
 In such a situation, after coming under pressure once again after the Pulwama attack, Pakistan has tried an old tactic of action against its terrorist organizations
 kai aatanki hiraasat main liye hai, sattar se zyaada sanghathanon par pabandi lagi he
 But the question is the same old, it should not be just a drama
 13 disambar 2001bhartiya sansad bhawan par hamalaa hua
 In which 9 people died
 is vaardaat kaa ilzaam aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ke sargana moulana masood azhar par tha
 Masood Azhar was taken into custody in the name of action but was freed after one year on the pretext of lack of evidence
 26 november 2008mumbai main aatanki hamalaa hua
 In which 66 innocent people died
 is hamale kaa ilzaam aatanki sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyyaba ke zakiurr rahamaan lakhvi or haafiz said par tha
 Pakistan gave assurance of investigation in the name of action
 iske baad disambar 2008 main lakhvi ko giraftaar bhi kiya gaya
 But on 9 April 2015 he was also released on the pretext of lack of evidence
 2 janvari 2016pathankot ke airforce stesan par hamalaa hua
 Three security personnel were killed in this terrorist attack
 is vaardaat ko anjaam dene kaa ilzaam aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ke sargana moulana masood azhar par hi tha
 Pakistan then detained Masood Azhar in the name of action
 lekin chand dinon baad uske khilaaf saare sabooton ko maangane se inkaar kar diya
 18 September 2016 Army camp in Uri was attacked in Kashmir
 is hamale main 18 jawan shahid ho gaye
 The incident was also accused of Maulana Masood Azhar, the leader of the terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed
 karrwai karne ke liye bharat ne phir pakistan ko dogier saunpa
 He also gave all the proofs
 lekin nateeja vahi purana ki paak sarkaar ne tamaam ilzaamon se inkaar kar diya
 This is the record which Pakistan has cooked the whole world by playing
 har baar ek nayaa aatanki hamalaa hota he
 Every time, with full evidence, action is demanded on terrorist organizations flourishing in Pakistan
 or har baar pakistan kuch dinon kii tafteesh kaa drama karne ke baad sabhi ke sabhi gunahagaaron ko sabooton kii kami ke naam par azaad kar detaa he
 This time also when the terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed attacked the CRPF convoy in Pulwama at the behest of Maulana Masood Azhar, sitting in Pakistan on 14 February
 to shaayad use ummid thi ki is baar bhi hindustan vaise hi sabooton ke saath pakistan se aatankiyon par karrwai kii maang karegaa
 But this time Pakistan's stakes backfired
 hindustan ne pehle saboot to nahin saunpe, balki pakistani hukmaranon se koi aas lagane ke bajaay sidhe jaish-e-mohammad ke balakot camp par hi dhaava bol diya
 The Indian Air Force carried out an air strike and hit so many bombs at the base of the terrorists that everything became smoke-smoke
 ye or baat he ki baad main pakistan ke kehane par saboot ke taur par bharat ne use apana dogier bhi saunp diya
 In which the names of the terrorists involved in this conspiracy of the attack along with the address was also recorded
 akatya saboot or air strike kii vajah se pakistan kii puri duniya main itani kirakiri ho gai ki is baar usne apni rahi-sahi izzat bachaae rakhane ke liye ek or hi nayaa shigufa chhod diya
 And this came in the presence of a press conference just on the eighth day of the Shigufa air strike
 jab pakistan ne duniya ko dikhaane ke liye apane 40 aatankwaadiyon ko hiraasat main lene or 70 aatanki sanghathanon par pratibandh lagane kaa elaan kiya
 Now call it the pressure of Hindustan or something else, among the 40 terrorists who have been detained by Pakistan, Masul Azhar's brother Abdul Rauf and Sala Hamad Azhar are also included
 jinke naam hindustan ne apane dogier main likhe hai
 While the banned organizations include jaish-e-mohammed as well as jamaat-ud-dawa to falah-e-insaniyat
 magar, sabase bada sawaal to yahi he ki kahin pakistan kii ye karrwai bhi usee dramebaazi kaa hissaa to nahin? kyonki tarikh gavaah he ki pakistan kabhi aatankwaadiyon par karrwai ko lekar sahi myne main sanjeeda nahin rahaa
 And for some reasons, thousands of terrorists not only thrived in Pakistan year after year, but also bled the world
 aise main jab tak pakistan in chhutbhaiye aatankwaadiyon ke saath-saath masood ajahar, hafij said, lakhvi, salahuddin or daaud ibrahim sareekhe logon ko ko unke sahi anjaam yani jail yaa maut kii sazaa nahin sunaata he, tab tak duniya main shaayad hi koi aisa hoga, jo pakistan ke is drame par yakeen karegaa

 He said that the agency had neither any evidence nor any strong basis for sending him to jail
 kapil sibbal-ye kehete hai ki gavaahon ko daraayenge
 Tell which witness you have talked to, why should they be sent to judicial custody? Not answered all the questions? Take ED custody, i have no problem, but do not send in judicial custody
 court ke paas power he idi castady main bhejne ke liye
 Tusshar Mehta - We have objection to this
 aap kis par bahes kar rahe hai, kya aap jamaanat par bahes kar rahe hai? jamaanat par bahes karenge to mujhe bolie, main bhi karuunga
 Kapil sibal-chidambaram as an accused in the 14-day custody, now what is the need to send him to judicial custody? i have the right, let me argue, the investigating agency does not have any evidence to prove the allegations
 sirf pareshaan karne ke liye unhen jail main bhejnaa chaahate hai

 "chini sarkaar dwaara galiyare kaa naam badalane kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos karne kii salaah dene par beijing kaa vichaar tha, "samprabhutaa vivaadon ke saath kuch nahin karnaa" he
 Beijing further clarified the situation, saying, "china is ready to work with all neighboring countries to strengthen connectivity and enhance regional economic cooperation
" china-pakistan aarthik coridor china or pakistan dwaara banaaya gaya ek sahakaari dhaancha he, jo sabhi kshetron main sahyog ko dhyaan main rakhte hue or donon deshon ke dirghakaalik vikaas ke liye he

 It is possible that the transmitter has been buried under the debris, officials say that the sea depth in this area is about 3

 After this message went viral, where the opposition started pinching
 meerut congress ke jila adhyaksh vinay pradhan ne party upaadhyaksharahul gandhiki tarif karte hue watsap par ek messej daalaa or unka saath dene kii apil kii

 yah baat jab pradesh congress adhyaksh rajbabbar ko pataa chali to unhone is par turant karrwai karte hue vinay pradhan ko sabhi padon se hataate hue party se suspend kar diya
 In fact, Pradhan wrote praising Rahul Gandhi - Rahul Gandhi, who also knows a part of the country by the name of Pappu
 aaj aap bataaen ki kya pappu ne kabhi mahangi gadiyon kaa shauk paala? jabaki wo paal sakate the
 Ambani, Adani, never joined Mallya's party, whereas they could have joined
 pappu ne kabhi shaan-shaukat kaa pradarshan kiya? nahin, parantu kar saktaa tha
 Pappu could also become a minister and a Prime Minister but was made? No
 jabaki manmohan singh to unako piem banane kaa ishaara kar chuke the
 Ambani and Adani wanted to meet Pappu for the whole ten years
 2004 se 2014 tak sarkaar rahi or pappu ke ek ishaare par sarkaar ke mantri unka kaam kar sakate the lekin pappu ne ambani, adani ko 5 minute kaa samay bhi nahin diya

 mantri se sawaal yah tha ki aapke virdohi kehete hai ki sarkaar madrason kaa bhagavakaran karnaa chaahati he
 His answer was on saffron clothes
 mohsin raja ne kaha ki, 'ye to kudarat kii dein he
 Allah's gift is saffron
 ye yogi ji kii dein nahin he
 Yogi Ji has worn it
 ye ishwar kii dein he
 Allah's gift
 tabhi to aaj puure uttar pradesh main ujaalaa he yogi ji kii vajah se
 When asked if Mohsin Raza asked if he wanted saffron dress code in madrasas, he said, 'muslims wear saffron beforehand
 khwaja moinuddin chishti ko maanane vaale chishtiya silsile ke sufi hamesh se bhagava pahante hai
 Ask those who are worried why they wear saffron? Mohsin Raza is not just a fan of saffron
 vah aresas ke bhi bade fain hai
 It is said that 'the union of those who serve the nation selflessly is called the National self-service Association
 ve agar acha kaam kar rahe hai to aitraaj kis baat kaa? iske saath-saath mohsin raja yah bhi jodate hai ki 've personal lau board kholkar thode baithe hai
 Are servants of the nation
 'unhone kaha ki samaaj main do majahabon main badhate bantwaaron main rang bhi bant gaye hai

 koi musalmaan bhagava rang pasand bhi kar saktaa he, lekin jab yogi ji ke mantri aisa kahen to log isamen pasand se zyada siyasat dhundhate hai

 rjd's argument on Tejashwi's resignation, while RJD says that he remains in the cabinet even after the charge sheet has been filed against Cabinet Minister Uma Bharti in the Babri demolition case, so why is Tejashwi's resignation being sought?

 katju ne lekh main narendra modi kii aalochana karte hue desh ke logon se apil kii he ki ve soch-samajhakar pradhanmantri chune

 ullekhneey he ki katju ne haal hi main bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par bhi hamalaa karte hue kaha tha ki bihar main press kii aazaadee nahin he
 Here, Katju commented on Jaitley, saying that the BJP leader has kept half the truth and he has come down heavily on personal attacks
 katju ne kaha, jab fasebuk prakaran ko lekar do ladakiyon kii giraftaar hui thi, tab maine maharashtra ke mukhyamantri kii bhi aalochana kii thi
 i also issued a notice to the Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh when he threatened to break the camera of a media person
 isliye maine congressi sarkaar kii bhi aalochana kii he

 In January this year, four senior judges of the Supreme Court, taking unprecedented steps, called a press conference and raised many issues and said that all is not going well in the Supreme Court
 aisa hi rahaa to yah loktantr ko nasht kar degaa
 The big issue was the allocation of the Bench of the cases of Chief Justice of India, Deepak Mishra
 unka kahana tha ki pradhan nyaayadhish ''barabari ke jajon ke bich sabase varisht jaj maatr hote hai, isse adhik nahin
 The reference was Judge B
 ech
 Hearing of the case related to Loya's death in a suspicious condition, to the bench of Justice Aruna Mishra
 loya soharabuddin shaikh hatyakand kii sunwaayee kar rahe the jiske aropiyon main sattadhari bhartiya janata party ke adhyaksh amit shah kaa bhi naam tha
 In this session, two speakers had different opinions on the same issue
 indira jai singh kaa maananaa tha ki karypalika, nyaaypalika ko prabhavit karne kii koshish kar rahi he, vahiin pinki anand ke mutabik, maamle ko bevajaah tool diya gaya or nyaaypalika kii pavitrataa kisi bhi keemat par akshunn rakhi jaani chahie
 Indira Jai singhvakil, the Supreme Court takes various forms of corruption, especially in today's context, kneeling before the executive's intent would be one of the most dangerous forms of corruption
 har mukhya nyaayadhish ke paas yah nirnay karne kaa adhikaar hota he ki koun-sa maamla kis bench ke paas jayega or apane is adhikaar kaa prayog karke yah tay kiya ja saktaa he ki mukademe kaa faisla kis ore jayega
 It depends on whom you are giving admission to the judiciary
 yadi aise logon kii niyukti karne ja rahe hai jo aapke vichaaron se sahmati rakhte hai yaa dakshinpanthi vichaardhaara se prabhavit hai to yah bilkul kaha ja saktaa he ki nyaaypalika kaa raajnneetikaran ho rahaa he
 The collegium recommended the appointment of Judge Joseph of Uttaranchal
 sarkaar ne ise kyon roak rakhaa he? niyukti kii sifarish ke chah maheene se zyada kaa samay biit chukaa he
 There is a strange peace in the Supreme Court, but in reality it is not
 har baar jab main courtroom main pravesh karti hum, yah sochakar meraa kalejaa munh ko aa jaataa he ki jis jaj ke saamne pesh hui hum ve kis paksh main khadey honge
 It is the same as a volcano, no less
 yadi paardarshita na ho, abhivyakti kii swatantraaa na ho, to loktantr par aanch aati he
 In a country where the press is not free, the judiciary is not impartial, then there is nothing left
 phir sab bhul jaaie
 "pinki Anandbharat's Additional Solicitor General '' Supreme Court cannot be corrupted
 is samay hamen har cheez ke peeche kuch na kuch sandigdh dekhne ke chalan ko rokna hoga
 Fearing a conspiracy behind everything, saying that "it is feared that the Supreme Court has become corrupt
" kuch to pareshaani he, jiske kaaran jajon ko press ke saamne jane ko vivash hona padaa
 “all this has to be stopped
 parde ke peeche kuch-na-kuch gadabad chal rahi he, hameshaa isi soch se grast rahane se behatar hoga ki ham sanstha ke saath khadey hon
 When you have three parts of the government, there is always a possibility of some kind of movement, some kind of catalyst, some kind of confrontation
 tanaav kii ashanka se bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 It depends on what level we take the matter
 bharat samet duniya main jab bhi saamaajik kalyaan se jude muddon kii baat aati he, vahaan aap nyaaypalika ko vanchiton or shoshiton ke adhikaron kii raksha karte or unke adhikaar unhen dilaate paaenge

 Do you know that there has just been an election in North Korea
 ye chunaav uttar korea kaa nayaa shaasha, nai sarkaar chunane ke liye tha
 Elections in a country where there is dictatorship, where there is a dictator
 vahiin chunaav bhi hua or nayaa leader bhi chun liya gaya
 The most amazing thing is that Marshall Kim Jong won them in this election with all the votes but not the heavy weight
 ab kiski shamat ai thi jo marshall kim jong un kaa vot kaat saktaa tha?seen filmi he
 
 kahani ek mulk kii he jahaan taanaashaahee thi
 The dictator leans under the pressure of the world
 elaan karata he ki uske desh main loktantr hoga or janata khud apni sarkaar chunegi
 Election date is fixed
 log apni sarkaar chunane ke liye vot dene qataar main khadey ho jate hai
 The public was voting for another candidate than the dictator
 bas tabhi ek top nazar aati he
 The line changes
 taanashaah chunaav jeet jaataa he
 The world highly praises the democratically elected dictator
 ab is seen se baahar aate hai
 That country is North Korea
 vahaan bhi taanaashaahee he
 But the dictator wants to conduct elections
 taaki duniya ko bataa sake ki wo bhi loktantric tareeke se chunaa gaya he
 Yes, we are talking about North Korean dictator Marshall Kim Jong Un
 duniya jaanati he kim jong un ek taanashaah he
 No one can breathe in North Korea without his consent
 vahiin kim jong un agar chunaav main khadaa ho jaae to phir kiski himmat jo uske mukaabil ho
 But still elections were held in North Korea
 chunaav main kim jong un khadaa hua or chunaav jeet bhi gaya
 But how did all this happen? kim jong un ne chunaav karaayaa kyon? chunaav main kitne ummidavaar maidan main utre? kitne logon ne vot die
 How many votes did Kim Jong Un get? Did people vote against Kim Jong Un? Who counted the votes? Who announced the result? Who were the people to conduct the election? So just wait
 aapako silsilewar ek ek sawaal kaa jawaab milegaa
 Elections were held for a total of 687 seats in North Korea on Sunday, 10 March 2019
 pyongyang main chunaav ke din kii tasviren saamne ai
 When Koreans were seen celebrating the election like a celebration
 is chunaav main north korea ke marshall kim jong un ne bhi hissaa liya
 But before this celebration, every person present in North Korea voted out of the house
 kyonki yahaan uttar korea ke har naagarik ke liye vot karnaa zaruri he
 Millions of voters gathered at the polling center
 magar is baar kaa chunaav har baar ke chunaav se bilkul alag tha
 Because instead of ballot paper, this card was being given only this time
 or is card par sirf ek hi party kaa naam likhaa tha varkar party of korea
 There were only two pieces to put on this card
 haa
 
 yani aap is party ke samarthan main hai or naa
 That means AAP is against this party
 itane din main aap samaj to gaye hi honge ki uttar korea main kim jong un ko naa kehane kaa matlab kya he
 This was the only election in the world in which there was no rival candidate
 kaayade se to ise chunaav hi nahin kahana chahie
 Because in this the voter was not allowed to choose the candidate on the ballot
 balki asal main to unhen ek warrant diya gaya
 On which yes means life and no means death
 kareeb saade 4 maheene baad is chunaav kaa nateeja ab aayaa he
 Workers Party of Korea candidates won unopposed in all 687 seats in the country
 bharat main jis tarah desh ke liye loksabhaa or rajyon ke liye vidhansabha chunaav hote hai, vaise hi vahaan supreme pipul essembly or local pipul essembly ke liye chunaav hote hai
 Elections are held here every 4 years for the Supreme Assembly and every 5 years for the local assembly
 is saal march main hua ye chunaav supreme pipul essembly ke liye tha
 99 in this election held in North Korea
 98 fisadi voting hui
 The decimal 02 percent who did not vote were all out of the country
 jo log biimaar the yaa buzurg the unase mobile voting ke zarie vot karwaai gai
 This is the reason that North Korea's voting percentage improved this time compared to last time
 pichhali baar chunaav main uttar korea main 99
 97 percent of the votes were cast
 iskaa matlab he ki 
 01% voting has improved
 donon baar 99 pratishat vot pade the
 North Korea has broken its own record of voting percentages all over the world
 wo bhi 
 From 01%
 uttar korea main voting kaa ye percentage is liye hairaan nahin kar rahaa he kyonki jis desh main apane man kii hair style tak rakhane kii azaadi naa ho
 It is also meaningless to talk about choosing your favorite candidate there
 har baar kii tarah khud kim jong un ne bhi vot daalaa
 At booth number 201 of South Hameyong, Kim cast his vote and ordered his countrymen to participate in voting
 ye usee aadesh kaa nateeja he ki chunaav main 99
 98% voting was done
 kim jong un varkar party ke head hai
 And also Supreme Head of Armed Forces
 vaise kehane ko uttar korea ko to kim jong un ‘democratic piples republic of korea’ kahata he
 Which is fine to hear, but the world is seeing the situation of democracy here
 rasaadaaygi ke liye hi sahi magar uttar korea ke ellection kamishan ne kareeb saade chaar maheene baad ye elaan kiya ki varkar party of korea ne 10 march ko hue chunaav main sabhi siten jeet leen he or is party ke haq main 99
 98% voting was done
 aapako bataa den ki north korea main kul kitne voter hai, isaki thik thik jaankaree kisi bhi videshi agency ke paas nahin he
 But if 2 crore out of the total population of 2
5 crores of the country, voters are also considered
 to unamem se ek karod sattanve lakh chhiyannbe hazaar logon ne kim kii party ko vot kiya
 Those who did not were just those who were out of the country
 north korea main har 17 saal ke insaan ko vot karne kaa adhikaar he
 Overall, after this election result, North Korea's Marshal Kim Jong Un has got the democratic right to run the country again by the next four more years
 haalanki naa bhi miltaa to wo taanaashaahee andaaz main desh chalaa hi letaa
 Because till now, only the Kim dynasty has ruled this country since independence
 or ab to marshall kim jong un kii sultanate par chaaya america khatra bhi takreeban khatm ho chukaa he
 The trump and Kim who were trying to kill each other are not tired of praising each other today
 isamen shaq nahin ki duniya ke dabaav main uttar korea main hua ye chanaav mahaz ek rasaadaaygi tha
 But the way this one-sided election took place here, it has definitely remained a matter of worldwide discussion
 haalanki isse pehle jo chunaav hue the usamen varkar party of korea ke alaava bhi duusari partiyon ne hissaa liya tha
 But this time he did not get Kim's permission to contest the election
 kya pataa agar ijaajat mil gai hoti to poling booth par kuch alag hi seen najar aata

 He took the names of many more who donated to the party through fraudulent means
 unhone kaha ki saikadon companiyon ek hi pate par banaaya gaya
 Many companies were also shown as foreign companies
 unhone ramesh kaa zikr kiya jinhone ek karod 10 lakh rupee se adhik kaa party ko daan diya
 He said that this man does not even have the ability to give so much money
 yah keval 2500 rupee de saktaa tha
 a woman gave Rs 90 lakhs, who has so far paid only Rs 4000 income tax
 unhone kai aise check dikhaae jin par koi naam nahin he, un par koi taarikh nahin he
 Still money came to the party's account

 The team of doctors asked him to be hospitalized
 lekin, kapil iske liye taiyaar nahin hue the
 They say that the doctors from whose team their report is being taken is not correct
 dilli police kii ek team vahaan lagaataar maujuud he
 Tents have been erected at Mishra's civil lines government residence
 bataa den ki is bhukh hadtaal ke liye unki maang ve pehle hi saaf kar chuke hai
 He has clearly said that till the Aam Aadmi Party does not make public about the foreign visits of its five leaders, the party will go on hunger strike

 Kapil Mishra alleges that these people have taken personal advantage of foreign tours by misusing party funds
 unhone kaha ki ye paanch kyon videsh gaye the, kiske kharche par gaye the, kahaan ruke the, kisase mili the
 The comments unka kahana he ki party lagaataar pichley kuch samay se yah kah rahi he ki party ke paas fund kii kami he, to aakhir ye netaa kiske kharche par videsh yatraaon kaa laabh le rahe the
 He said that these people also went to Russia

 Let us know that a letter has also been written for Aam Aadmi Party convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 kaise saikadon kii sankhya main farji companiyon se party ko fund diya gaya or party ne isaki jaankaree chunaav ayog or iskar vibhaag se chhipaai
 He said that this is the reason why the party is not giving information about the foreign visits of five people
 yah sara khel hawala kaa he or kalaadhan ko safed karne kaa he
 Mishra said that the country has been deceived
 unhone kaha ki is anshan ko jabarajasti ne tudvaya jaae

 Priyanka Gandhi has right from the backdoor but has taken an active role in UP politics
 pichley kuch maheenon se ataki gathbandhan kii ganth priyanka ne chand baithkon main sulajhaa lee he
 According to the latest information, SP will now contest 298 seats and Congress in 105 seats
 haalanki abhi amethi or raibareli jile kii siton par sthiti spasht nahin he
 It is expected that the coalition will be formally announced shortly
 varisht congressi netaa ahamed patel ne twit kar bataaya he ki gathbandhan kii khatir priyanka or akhilesh ke bich baatcheet hui thi
 Priyanka has been in demand politics for 27 years, Congress leaders and activists have been raising demands for Priyanka Gandhi to enter active politics (especially UP) in order to revive the Congress
 'priyanka lao congress bachaao' or 'maiya rahati biimaar, bhaiya par bad gaya bhaar' jaise poster or naare priyanka kii khatir kai baar lagate rahe hai
 In the past, Priyanka Gandhi has also been campaigning for the Congress in UP in the past
 haalanki ab tak ve apni maa sonia gandhi or bhai rahul gandhi ke liye prachaar karti rahi hai
 Publicity command of Amethi and Rae Bareli districts has remained in their hands
 ve khud amethi or raibareli se vyaktigat lagaav rakhti hai
 Their children too often go to Amethi and Rae Bareli
 is chunaav main priyanka mahatvapoornkuch din purv hi priyanka or dimple ko lekar pratapgarh main laga ek poster viral hua tha
 In which there is a picture on the poster of the local candidate with Priyanka Gandhi and Dimple Yadav
 usamen likhaa gaya he ki upi main ab baj gaya mahila shashaktikaran kaa danka morche par dimple bhabhi, bahan priyanka
 Priyanka's active involvement in politics may also be fatal for her brother Rahul Gandhi, as the Congress has lost nearly 20 elections under Rahul's leadership
 yah congress main ek record he
 The top faction of the Congress may want to see Rahul Gandhi as the President, but in the Congress from time to time there has been a voice against Rahul
 chunaavon main lagaataar haar kaa munh dekh rahi congress main kai baar 'rahul hataao congress bachaao' ke naare bhi lag chuke hai
 In such a situation, if the sp-congress alliance in UP comes forward under the leadership of Priyanka, it may be like Priyanka scoring a century in the first inning
 pike bhi rakh chuke hai mancongress ke liye chunaavon main prachaar kaman sambhaal rahe prashanth kishor khud party ke sheersh netritv ko kai baar yah baat kah chuke hai ki agar chunaav jeetna he to priyanka ko aage laana hoga
 However, at that time the party deferred his opinion saying that it is not the right time for this
 priyanka hongi star prachaarpub yah spasht he ki chunaavon main priyanka gandhi ahm bhoomika main hogi
 According to Congress sources, this time it is certain that Priyanka will campaign for the party outside Amethi, the parliamentary constituency of her mother Sonia Gandhi and brother Rahul Gandhi
 pradesh congress chunaav prachaar samiti ke adhyaksh sanjay singh ne bhi ek samachar channel se baatcheet main is baat kii pushti kii thi
 He had said that, "she (priyanka Gandhi Vadra) will play an important role in the state assembly election campaign
 "shanivaar ko bhi hui thi batgabandhan kii khatir priyanka gandhi ne nai dilli main shanivaar der raat ramgopal se mulaakaat kii thi
 On the other hand, there was a conversation between CM Akhilesh Yadav and Congress strategist Prashant Kishore
 baithkon main siton ke bantwaare par ek baar phir se charchaa hui thi
 Talk of a long-standing coalition The sp-congress alliance was going on for the last three months
 sapa main uthe vivaad ke purv mulaayam congress ke saath gathbandhan ke mood main the tab akhilesh iske liye taiyaar nahin the
 However, he himself spoke for the alliance at the time of the party's feud
 gathbandhan ke baad siton ko lekar maamla fansaa hua tha jo ab sulajhata hua najar aa rahaa he
 The Congress was continuously back in UP, the last time the Congress came to power under the leadership of Narayan Dutt Tiwari
 5 disambar 1989 ko narayan dutt tiwari ne mukhyamantri kii kursi chodi thi
 In every assembly election that followed, the SP grew and the Congress lagged behind

 aksar congress ko apane jubaani hathiyaaron se hataash karne vaale modi par congress ne junagarh kii raily main joardaar palatwaar kiya
 The president of the Gujarat Congress, without naming anyone, said that what the monkeys compete with the lions
 ab ye kehane kii zarurat nahin ki arjuna modhwadiya kaa ishaara kiski taraf tha
 Who were they telling the lion and with whom were they comparing the monkey
 baat yaheen khatm nahin hui
 Another Congress veteran lashed out at Vivekananda Gadkari's statement
 chunaav prachaar main muddon kii baat nahin ho rahi
 Whether it is Modi or the Congress leader, whenever there is an opportunity, there is a linguistic war against each other and mud is thrown at each other

 Sudhir Chandra has given the full impression of Gandhi's long letter in this book and also Nehru's brief answer that i will write in detail as soon as time comes
 jawahar, gandhi kii kisi baat kaa jawaab nahin dete hai or baad main bhi is sawaal par vistaar se nahin likhte hai
 i would say that if there are seven lakh villages, then believe it to be seven lakh units
 ye gandhi kaa vaakya he jise ab har koi liye ghumta he
 Sticks on posters, but seven lakh units remain slaves of BDO and Tehsildars
 gandhi ke is akelepan kaa konaa dekhnaa ho to aap is kitaab se guzar sakate hai
 Perhaps falling alone is the destiny of any Gandhi
 "main safal hokar maranaa chahta hum, vifal hokar nahin
 But maybe i fail
 " gandhi ne noakhli main professor nirmal kumaar bose se yah baat kahi thi
 To fail is also destined to be Gandhi
 magar gandhi ke bina na to gandhi hua ja saktaa he na loktantric
 Therefore, that unsuccessful man is still alive in us
 gandhi kaa swaraj unki ankhon ke saamne samaapt ho gaya tha
 The Congress started making fun of Swaraj
 gandhi ke swaraj ko samajhane ke liye us chitthee ko padhaa janaa chahie, jo unhone jawahar laal nehru ko likhi thi
 Also read his speech which he gave in prayer speech on 15 June 1947
 hindu muslim dangon kii prishthbhumi main anhisa ko lekar chatapataahat badhati ja rahi thi
 Sudhir writes that Gandhi again wanted to get involved in proving the truth of non-violence
 is sandarbh main noakhli se pehle kolkata main muslim lig ke netaa soharavardi ke saath kisi danga peedit ilaake ke ghar main ek saath rahane kaa prayog adbhut he
 The way Sudhir Chandra has given details of those situations, he stands up like a present
 gandhi phir se jua khelte hai
 They put their lives at stake
 congress ne gandhi ko chhod diya tha
 Since then, every party has left Gandhi
 unhone bhi jo gandhi kii baton ko lekar congress ko koste hai
 They should look inside themselves to see if there is any Gandhi left in them
 ahimsa bachi he
 Swaraj is left
 gandhi ke raste main loktantr to he, magar satta kaa niyantran nahin he
 We have somehow assumed that control over power and leadership is the ultimate path to liberation
 ek asafal maarg par ham kabase chalate rahe hai
 How long will it last? gandhi asafal hokar chal nahin sake
 We are going on the same path without fail
 kitna fark he gandhi hone main or kitna mazaa he gandhi nahin hone main
 Along with the election announcement, Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal has been seen attacking PM Narendra Modi in a different way these days
 dilli main loksabhaa chunaav ke liye, prachaar kii shuruyaat ke saath hi kejariwal dilli kii janata ke bich notebandi se lekar ceiling kaa zikr kar rahe hai or khud ko padhaa likhaa bhi bataa rahe hai
 Arvind Kejriwal, seeking votes from Delhiites in the name of full state, is claiming the next 10 years of planning among the public
 prachaar ke dauraan ek jansabha main unhone kaha ki "aaj puri planning karke aayaa hoon, zimmedaari ke saath kah rahaa hum purna rajya banate hi 10 saal ke andar har parivaar ko ek ghar milegaa"apane vaade ko majboot karne ke liye arvind kejariwal ne 2015 vidhansabha chunaav se pehle kiye apane ek vaade kaa zikr karte hue khud ko padhaa likhaa bhi bataa diya
 He said, "BJP people used to make fun of us when it came to power shortages
 phir satta main aane ke baad 1 maheene ke andar bijli ke daam saste karke dikhaae
 i am a written man, i do not have a fake degree
 "aage kejariwal ne kaha ki bijepi ko lagata tha ki ye aam aadmi party vaale kal ke ladke hai, ye raajnneeti main kahaan se aa gaye
 Therefore, the BJP government sitting at the center is preventing the Aam Aadmi Party government of Delhi from working
 iske alaava arvind kejariwal ne loksabhaa chunaav main pradhanmantri ke chehre ko vot na dene kii anokhi apil kii
 Kejriwal told the people present in the public meeting that "don't get caught up in making the Prime Minister this time
 jaise logon ne 2015 main dimag se soch samajhakar vot diya tha or bijepi se lekar congress ko saaf kar, nai party ko 67 seat di vaise hi vot karnaa
 Arvind Kejriwal also targeted PM Narendra Modi, citing the reason for not voting for the post of Prime Minister
 kejariwal ne logon se poocha or khud jawaab dete hue kaha ki "modi ji ko pradhanmantri banaakar kuch mila? notebandi kara di, logon ke dhandhe or dukaan band kara die
 So vote for the Prime Minister, or else he will put obstacles in Delhi's work
 "arvind kejariwal ne piem modi par dilli ko purna rajya kaa vaada puraa na karne kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 He said that "in the last election Modi ji promised to give Delhi a full state but after 5 years Delhi did not become a full state, Modi ji gave a promise
 isliye, is baar purna rajya ke liye vot dena
 If the seven mps of the Aam Aadmi Party have come, then even if they have to sit in the house of the Prime Minister and sit and protest, we will make Delhi a full state in 2 years
 " For the first time in its four-and-a-half-year tenure, the Modi government is undergoing a litmus test
 tidipi dwaara modi sarkaar ke khilaaf laae avishvaas prastaav par aaj charchaa or voting hogi
 Naveen Patnaik's party Biju Janata Dal (BJD) walked out of the House even before the debate started in Parliament
 is tarah se bijedy ne voting or charchaa donon se apane aapako baahar rakhaa he
 Currently, the BJD has 19 mps in the Lok Sabha
 ise modi sarkaar ke liye raahat maani jaani chahie
 At the same time, it is being considered as a big blow to the opposition
 loksabhaa se walkout karne par bijedy saansad tathagat satpathi kaa kahana he, 'ham is dibet main bhaag nahin lenaa chaahate hai
 We do not want to join the motion of no confidence
 kyonki endie or upie donon ne hi odisha kii janata ke saath dhokhaa kiya he
 Has ruined them
 ham kisi ke saath nahin hai
 We are with the people of Odisha
 hamaare liye odisha kii janata ke mudde hai
 We do not want to support anyone
 naa endie kaa saath dena chaahate hai naa upie kaa saath dena chaahate hai
 On the bjp's benefit from the walkout, Tathagata Satpathy says, "we have not done a walkout for anyone's benefit
" ham upie or endie donon ke hi khilaaf hai
 Our aim is not to benefit Hindus
 hamaara makasad odisha kii janata kaa phayda sochna he
 Tathagata Satpathy says that our enemy is both the UPA and the NDA
 isliye donon main se kisi ke saath jane kaa matlab nahin banataa he
 That is why we have gone out of the house
 apana matdaan nahin karenge
 'let us tell that two members are nominated in the Lok Sabha with 545 members
 is tarah se 543 sadsy par hi nirvaachit hokar aate hai
 At present, 11 seats are vacant, so the current number of mps is 532
 is lihaaj bijepi ko bahumat hasil karne ke liye mahaj 267 saansad chahie
 The BJP currently has 272 members, replacing the Lok Sabha Speaker
 jabaki endie 313 sadsy hai lekin shivasena ne sadan se baahar rahane kaa faisla kiya he
 In this way 295 members are left
 vahiin, modi sarkaar ke virodh main 147 saansad hai
 In favor of Modi government BJP- 272 MPLJP- 6 MP Akali Dal- 4 MPRLSP- 3 MPJDU- 2 MP Apna Dal- 2 MP Other Party- 6 MP Shiv Sena has 18 mps
 avishvaas prastaav par sadan main voting ke dauraan shivasena ne sadan se baahar rahane kaa faisla kiya he
 If we combine the mps of all these parties of NDA, then the figure sits at 313
 These parties are in opposition to the Modi government
 - 16 mps: The figure of mps of all these parties of the opposition reaches 147
 ediemke- 37 saansad voting ke dauraan sadan se baahar rahane kaa faisla
 Shiv Sena-18 MP decides to stay out of the house during voting
 bijedy-19 saansad ne sadan se baahar rahegianya dal- 16 saansdin sabhi dalon ke saansadon kaa aankada 90 pahunchataa he
 Emphasizing the practice of manual scavenging and compliance with the law to curb dry latrine, the government said today that this practice is continuing in some states due to continued dry latrine
 loksabhaa main em raja mohan reddy, bocha jhaansi lakshmi ke prashn ke likhit uttar main saamaajik nyaay evam adhikarita rajya mantri di nepolian ne kaha ki rajyon or centre shasit pradeshon se praapt report ke anusaar abhi
 , 18,474 Scavengers and their dependents are being worked on employment and rehabilitation scheme
 unhone kaha ki desh ke 23 rajyon evam centre shasit pradeshon main mailaa dhone evam dry latrine nirodhak kanoon ko lagu kiya gaya he jabaki manipur or mizoram main koi dry latrine nahin hone kii report praapt hui he
 The minister said that Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan have their own laws like this, while Jammu and Kashmir has not yet implemented the law
 nepolian ne kaha ki teen rajyon bihar, uttarapradesh or uttarakhand main abhi bhi dry latrine kaa chalan he
 After the Supreme Court rejected the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC), now the central government is again trying to present its stand
 supreme court ko die jane vaale jawaab main sarkaar kaa plan he ki ucch stareey nyaayik niyuktiyon main puri paardarshita barti jaae
 The government says that the information related to judicial appointment should be released on the website of the Supreme Court and the High Court so that the collegium system of the highest court should be more transparent
 16 oktober ko supreme court ne NJAC ko asanvaidhanik ghoshit karte hue colegium system main sudhaar ke suzav maange the
 Also fixed November 3 for hearing the case
 kanoon mantralay ne bulaai thi baithcocourt ke is bade faisle ke baadakaanoon mantralay ne ucch stareey baithak bulaai or nirnay liya gaya ki court ke faisle par punarvichaar nahin kiya jayega or sarkaar court kii ore se sujhaaye gaye colegium system ko sudhaarney main vistaar se baaten rakhegi
 Government is waiting, according to the sources, the government is currently waiting for the issue to either go to the Standing Committee of Parliament or the Select Committee should take any step on the decision of the Supreme Court
 unhone bataaya, 'samvidhan main 99waan sanshodhan karke NJAC ko sansad main paas karaayaa gaya he or use aadhe se adhik rajyon kii bhi sweekruti mil chuki he
 Now it depends on the political parties whether they want to implement the rules or not
 'bataa den ki NJAC ko lekar uthe vivaad ke baad kai hoicourt main jajon kii bhartee nahin ho saki he
 There are 1017 judges posts in 24 High Courts of the country, out of which 384 posts are vacant
 yah bhi ek vajah he ki lagaataar adaalaton main cese badhate ja rahe hai
 Barely a decade ago, two important addresses in Delhi — Keshav Kunj of Jhandewalan and 11 of Lutyens' Delhi, Ashok Road — exposed conflicting identities: rigorous discipline vs
 sabotage, squandering vs
 prosperity, stagnation vs
 progress
 keshav kunj sangh parivaar ke naitik or vaicharik disha-nirdeshak rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kaa dilli mukhyalay he jabaki 11, ashok road sangh ke rajnatik mukhute bhartiya janata party kaa karyaalay he
 The campus of Keshav Kunj, once named after Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, who founded the RSS in 1925 in Pune, which was once very simple, is changing very fast today
 jabardast police suraksha or bandobast se ghire is parisar main aaj lagaataar failte hue sanghathan ko samahit karne ke liye ek bhavy das manjila imaarat ban rahi he
 Looking at this building, it can be said that today it has become difficult to differentiate between the Sangh and the BJP
 yah imaarat sangh ke samskruti ke haashiye se raajnneeti ke centre main pahunchane ke shandaar safar kii abhivyakti he
 Great leap: In its history, the RSS has never progressed as fast as it has done in the last five years
 isaki 2010 main 40,000 shakhaaen hua karti thim
 Today their number is around 57,000
 aresas main sadsyta kaa koi “aupchaarik” dhaancha nahin he lekin isaki shakhaon main ho rahe ijaphe ne ise bijepi ke ek urvar bhartee centre main tabdeel kar daalaa he, saath hi sanghathan kaa raajnneeti main dakhal pehle ke mukaable aaj kahin zyada ho chalaa he
 To see an example of how many Sangh pracharaks are able to become leaders of the BJP, it would be enough to see the selection of BJP heads of the five states where elections are due in 2017 on the last 8 April
 inamen do anya pichhadi jatiyon (obisi) se hai, jabaki ek dalit he
 Keshav Chandra Maurya, the new BJP president of Uttar Pradesh, Union minister and Dalit Vijay Sampla, elected Punjab BJP president, OBC leader in Telangana

 Maurya has been in the organization for 14 years and was active in Ayodhya and Goraksha movements
 immergency ke 1977 main ant ke baad aise do charan aae hai, jab sangh ke aakaar main failaav hua he
 Between 1977 and 1994, under the leadership of the third Sarsanghchalak Balasaheb Deoras, who actively participated in Jayaprakash Narayan's movement, the Sangh branches grew threefold and grew from 10,000 to nearly 30,000
 oochaal kii is avadhi ke baad 2010 tak susti bani rahi
 After that once again started spreading which continues till today
 maujuuda charan atishay rajnatik bhi he
 The rss's core character has changed due to the activism of the Sangh with the BJP, believes a senior campaigner, Lakshmi Narayan Bhala, who has worked in Odisha, Assam and Sikkim
 yah mul charitra duusare sarasanghachaalak madhav sadashiv golwalkar ne apni kitaab “banch of thots” main paribhaashit kiya he, “aresas sirf vichaaron or aadarshon kii shiksha dene vaali paathshaala nahin he
 It is a school for practical training in character building
 ” raajnneeti iske agenda main kabhi nahin rahi
 Bhala says, "in every state unit of the BJP, there is only a pracharak posted by the organization secretary RSS, but until a few years ago, politics within the Sangh was neither called nor called
 ” haalanki sangh ke prachaar pramukh manmohan vaidya kehete hai, “log jise aresas main badlaav ke taur par dekh rahe hai, vah vastav main prakritik vikascram he
 i have been associated with the association since childhood and have never avoided healthy and innovative ideas here
 ”asaliyat kya he, iskaa pataa un chaar rajyon ke chunaav prabhariyon se lag jaataa he jahaan philhal chunaav ho rahe hai
 In West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh of the Sangh replaces Rahul Sinha
 is saal bijepi kii jang main ahm sthaan rakhane vaale assam main sangh ke varisht netaa ram madhav ko sangh dwaara bijepi ke saath talmail baitaane ke liye niyukt kiya gaya or unhone party adhyaksh amit shah ke saath milakar bijepi ke prachaar abhiyaan kaa prabandhan kiya he
 Another Sangh pracharak in Tamil Nadu, Muralidhar Rao, is playing an important role in the campaign
 ve bijepi ke mahasachiv hai, swadeshi jaagran manch ke purv sanghathan sachiv or sangh ke vichaarak dattopant thengdi ke sahaayak rah chuke hai
 In Kerala, Shah has appointed Kamanam Rajasekharan, a staunch leader of the Sangh, as the head of state
 bhagava indradhanushkuch niyuktiyaan to sanghathan kaa aadhaar vyapak karne ke sarokaar kii pahchaan karaati hai
 It is difficult to get a solid data on the caste background of the Sangh workers, but one thing is certain that the Sangh is now moving away from its caste origin ie the Brahmin and Baniya base of Maharashtra and it started recruiting pracharaks among obcs and Dalits Done
 pehali baar is ore dhyaan dilaane waalon main ek america raajnneeti vigyaani paul brass the, jinhone bataaya tha ki pichhadi jatiyon ke bich sangh kaa prasar ayodhya andolan ke dauraan shuru hua tha
 a new base of activists was formed, more obcs and Dalits came in it, then reservations within the organization and Dalit agenda also started to be fiercely debated
 sangh isse waakif he ki 2014 kii baari jeet ke baavjood bijepi kaa kul vot pratishat 31 fisadi yani matadaataaon kaa mahaj ek-tihaai rahaa
 It is clear that Hindu vote is divided among castes
 isiilie aaj prayaas kiye ja rahe hai ki zyada samavesh ke jariye aisa bhagava indradhanush taiyaar ho, jisamen ve hindu bhi shaamil hon jinhen lambey samay tak sangh apane daayre se baahar rakhata aayaa he, yani dalit or adivasee
 The Sangh knows that its ambition for cultural and moral rejuvenation to regain India's "lost heritage" and become the leader of nations will remain a distant dream without establishing close cooperation and goodwill relations within the Hindu community

 We have learned a lot from the events between 1977 and 1980 and especially from 1998 to 2004 and today we have become more intelligent
 ” haalanki bheetar ke logon kaa kahana he ki modi sangh ke netritv par is maamle main baari pade hai ki ve apni sarkaar ke maujuuda kaarykaal ke ant tak saamaajik ekajutata or vikaas par aadhaarit ek samaveshi agenda par ranneetik rup se aage badaae ke liye sangh ko raji kar chuke hai
 He has promised the Sangh that issues like Article 370, Ram Janmabhoomi and Homecoming can be raised with more aggression in his next term
 ab yah samajhnaa mushkil nahin hoga ki sangh ne apane upar laade us “saanskrithik” labaade ko dhire-dhire chhaantnaa kyon shuru kar diya he, jo aarambhik dinon main uski pahchaan hua karata tha
 The main factors that have inspired the Sangh to participate in politics during the last few years have been its organizational strength and the historic victory of a former campaigner
 samanvay baithken sangh parivaar ke sabase ahm ghatakon ke bich rajnatik sahyog kaa ek paimaana hai, lekin sawaal uthta he ki kya is aatmavishvaas ne sangh ke mul charitra ko hi badal daalaa he?sabko jodgaye vaale bhagwatsangh or bijepi ke bich badhate sadbhaav kaa shrey mote taur par mohan bhagwat kii vyaavhaarikta ko jaataa he, jinhen sangh parivaar ke bheetar “sabko jodgaye vaala, santulankaaree or rajnatik drushtaa” mana jaataa he
 He replaced Sudarshan in March 2009
 bhagwat ke bijepi netaaon ke saath nijee sambandh kaaphi garmjoshi bhare hai
 His father Madhukarrao Bhagwat was a province pracharak of Gujarat, so Mohanji — as everyone fondly calls him — is proficient in Gujarati and his relationship with Prime Minister Modi and BJP president Amit Shah, in particular, is very cordial
 tisare sarasanghachaalak devaras kii tarah hi bhagwat bhi rajnatik sanliptata se sankoch nahin karte hai
 a pioneer of generational change within the BJP, Bhagwat has mobilized young RSS leaders like Dattatreya Hosabale and Krishna Gopal around him
 darasal, sangh kaa kayantaran in nae “udaar” chehron main sabase zyada dikhataa he
 Hosabale is a soft-spoken Kannada Brahmin at number three in Sahasarakaryavah and Sangh and has been a student of English literature
 sangh kii sangrakshanvaadi soch se kinaaraa karte hue unhone india today conklev main aitihaasik bayaan diya, “samalangikta se aresas ko dikkat kyon hone lagi? jab tak yah dusron ke jivan ko prabhavit nahin karata tab tak yah aparaadh nahin he
 Sexual preferences are personal matters
 ” yah na sirf party line se prasthaan he, balki ve sangh ke bheetar zyada mahilaon ko rakhe jane ke bhi pairokaar hai
 Bhagwat himself has organized several initiatives related to women empowerment within the Sangh
 yah samajhate hue ki sangh ko aksar purushon ke vishuddh giroh ke rup main samajhakar khaarij kiya jaataa rahaa he, unhone 2014 main do divasiy mahila samanvay kaa aayojan gajiabad main kiya tha jisamen sangh parivaar se sambhddha tamaam sanghathanon kii mahilaon ko manch diya gaya tha

 shanta kumari, gita tai gunde, pramila tai or kendriya mantri smriti irani samet 300 pratinidhiyon ne is aayojan main bhaag liya tha
 In due course of time there has been a lot of emphasis on gender inclusion in the recent debates of Hamadadamsangh
 pichley saal vrundavan main hui do din kii baithak main sangh ke netaaon ne apane sambhddha sanghathanon ko nirdesh diya tha ki ve mahilaon ko padaadhikari banaaen
 The Sangh has a strong women's organization, called Rashtra Sevika Samiti
 iskaa kaam rashtriya gatividhiyon ke liye hindu auraton ko sangathit karnaa he
 This organization has been working in consonance with the Sangh since 1936

 On 3 January last, the Sangh organized the Shiv Shakti Sangam near Pune
 yah purna ganavesh main kareeb 85,000 kaaryakartaaon or 50,000 samarthakon kaa jamaavada tha
 Two huge screens were placed and the event was live-streamed over the Internet
 sangh kii aadim samskruti main ek or chaunkaane vaala badlaav yah hua he ki usne apane saraswati shishu mandiron main angreji kii padhai shuru karvaa di he
 The slogan of the Sangh was "hindi, Hindu, Hindustan
" ” gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke bataur narendra modi ne jab sarkari praathmik vidyalayon main duusari bhashaa ke rup main hair grad angreji ko lagu kiya tha, to sangh se sambhddha gujarat vidya bharti ne unka kadaa virodh kiya tha
 The protest was so bitter that Modi had to reverse his decision
 aaj haalat yah he ki mohan bhagwat ke netritv main sangh ke apane skool saraswati shishu mandir kii kuch sau shakhaon main angreji madhyam kii shiksha di ja rahi he
 The increasing number of people in contradiction bars has made these meetings an arena of political discourse
 nae or puraane kaadaron ke bich takaraav bade hai
 This is a sign of the changing social structure of the Union
 rohit vemula kii khudakushi ke baad se sangh ke netaaon ke dimag main sirf dalit prashn hi gum rahaa he
 Recently, bjp's Dalit leader Sanjay Paswan warned his government that "the parties in power politics will have to take the Rohit Vemula episode seriously or else be prepared for outrage, retaliation, rebellion and reactions
" ”rohit vemula kii khudakushi ko jahaan ek jatke ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he, vahiin sangh parivaar ke bheetar is vakt sabase bheeshan bahes swadeshi banaam videshi par chal rahi he

 pachaas saal pehle golwalkar ne “hindu samaaj ko swasth sthiti main” bachaae rakhane ko “paavan kartavya” mana tha

 Chief Minister n Kiran Kumar Reddy and Leader of the Opposition n Chandrababu Naidu got into a heated debate in the Andhra Pradesh Assembly on Monday when the TDP chief said the government had become a big joke in public
 tedepa dwaara pesh kiye gaye avishvaas prastaav par charchaa naidu ne shuru kii or har morche par congress sarkaar kii asafalataaon ko ginanaa shuru kiya
 Naidu said, our no-confidence motion is not only against the Chief Minister, but also against the ministers
 yah sarkaar shashan karne ke liye hamaara vishwaas kho chuki he
 Kumar said, "we do not need Chandrababu's faith
" hamaare paas janata kaa vishwaas he or isiilie ham satta main hai
 The Leader of the Opposition took the name of the Chief Minister and made some comments about his administration
 is par reddy uthe or naaraazgi jaahir karte hue kaha ham abhi hisaab baraabar kar len
 Naidu also reacted to this
 unhone kaha, aap ek namit mukhyamantri hai
 You got this post by falling at Sonia's feet
 aap ek silband lipapha hai mukhyamantri or aapkaa netritv ridhhin he
 To this the Chief Minister replied, My family (kiran and his late father Amarnath Reddy) has won 12 elections on Congress ticket since 1962
 mere paas vidhayakon kaa samarthan or sonia gandhi kaa aashirwad he
 You stabbed (in 1995) the back of your body to become the chief minister
 naidu ne palatwaar kiya, main apane dam par khadaa hone vaala netaa hum
 You are a leader standing at the mercy of Sonia
 vipaksh ke netaa ne kaha, mukhyamantri ke taur par aap police kii suraksha ke bina janata ke bich nahin ja pate
 Your government has become a big joke among the public
 tedepa netaa ne varsh 2004 se rajya main chal rahe congress shashan ke dauraan hue vibhinn kathith ghotaalon kaa sandarbh diya
 Reddy's response to this was that a CBI investigation is going on against you (on the charge of accumulating more assets than known sources of income)
 aapako bhrashtachar ke bare main bolne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 Naidu also made comments against Home Minister Sabita Indra Reddy, after which a debate took place between her and Sabita
 sabita ne kaha, agar aapke paas mere yaa mere parivaar ke sadasyon ke khilaaf koi vishesh aarope hai to unhen likhit rup main sarkaar ko den taaki unki jaanch kii ja sake
 It is your responsibility to prove the allegations true
 yah takaraar khatm hone ke baad telugana raashtra samiti ke sadasyon ne khadey ho kar polavaram krishi pariyojna kii nividaaon ke mudde par apni party kaa sandarbh die jane kaa virodh kiya
 Naidu had alleged rigging of Polavaram tenders and tampering of files
 ek ayogy company ko pariyojna kaa theka dene ke liye congress or tiares main mileebhagat thi
 i demand the government to present all the related files in the House
 tiares sadasyon ne is par aapatti or virodh jataayaa
 TRS leader e Rajendra in the House demanded the government to order a CBI inquiry on the Polavaram tender issue
 unhone kaha, tedepa ko chahie ki vah aaropon ko sabit kare
 TDP members, especially members of the Telangana region, came before the seat demanding that they be given an opportunity to expose the TRS Congress agreement
 vidhansabha adhyaksh nadendala manohan ne isse inkaar karte hue kaha ki vipaksh ke netaa ko apni baat jari rakhane kii anumati di jaaegi
 The Assembly Speaker adjourned the proceedings when TDP members came before the seat
 kendra sarkaar ne desh main sarkari bainkon ke saamne khadi enpie (NPA- Non Performing Assets) kii samasya ko nipataane kii nai kavayad shuru kii he
 In the beginning of the year, the Central Government in January to free banks from npas 2
 1 lakh karod rupee ke ricapetaliseshan program ko manjuuri di
 At the same time, it is preparing to hand over IDBI Bank with the highest NPA ratio to the country's largest insurance company Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC)
 elisi main desh kii adhikansh janata kii jamaa-puunji he or vah prativarsh apni bachat se hajaaron-lakhon rupee nikaalkar elisi kii policy main daalata he
 With this money, his and his family's future is protected
 lekin ab kendra ek sarkari bank ko bachaane kii kavayad main ise elisi ke hawaale karne ja rahi he
 This clearly means that the money you deposit every year as a premium for LIC policy will now be used to save the bank from drowning
 sawaal kyon?lekin kya yah faisla desh main elisi ke graahakon ke hit main he? kya kendra sarkaar kaa yah faisla is baat kii guarantee detaa he ki issehidhbhi kii enpieki samasya dur ho jaaegi? or ant main kya is faisle se elisi ke graahakon kaa unke jeevankaal kaa sabase bada nivesh surakshit rahegaa?abhi kya he IDBI bank kii halaat?maujuuda samay main desh ke 21 sarkari bainkon main shumaar IDBI bank main kendra sarkaar kii 85 fisadi hissedari he
 During FY 2018, the central government has infused Rs 10,610 crore to help the bank under its recapitalization program
 vahiin IDBI bank desh ke bimarusarkaari bainkonmen sarvaadhik enpie anupaat vaala bank he
 During the last few years, in the name of banking reforms, the Central Government has worked on a strategy to reduce its stake in sick public sector banks
 is ranneeti ke tahat IDBI se hissedari kam karnaa kendra sarkaar ke liye sabase aasaan he kyonki IDBI bank naishanalineeshan act ke tahat nahin aata or hissedari kam karne main use kisi tarah kii kanoonee aadchan kaa saamana nahin karnaa padega
 At the same time, LIC, the country's largest life insurance company, is looking to make a place in the banking business for a long time
 isaki ahm vajah uske paas badi maatra main padaa capital he jo deshbhar main elisi policy ke graahakon dwaara bataur premium ekatra kiya jaataa he
 However, in the past, the central government had also approved LIC to invest in the stock market to earn more than this money
 is faisle se bhi elisi ke graahakon kii jamaa puunji par khatra bad gaya tha
 At the same time, for entry in LIC banking itself, not only IDBI but almost all government banks are sitting on some stake purchase
 lihaaja, maujuuda samay main jab kendra sarkaar banking sudhaar ke naam par IDBI kii hissedari chhodane kii kavayad kar rahi he to elisi ke liye bhi mauka khud ke liye ek bank taiyaar karne kaa he
 It is time for the decision that the Central Government has knocked on the door of the insurance regulator on this proposal
 regulator ko shuukravaar ko is saude par faisla lenaa he
 At present, LIC is a major player in the loan market even without being banked
 vitt varsh 2017 ke dauraan elisi ne 1 trillian rupee se adhik kaa karj bazaar ko diya tha or isi karj ke kaarobaar ko banaae rakhane ke liye usne lagbhag sabhi sarkari bainkon main kuch na kuch hissedari kharid kar rakhi he
 But now after getting into the role of the bank itself, LIC will face the same challenge due to which most of the government banks are stuck in the trap of NPA by distributing bad loans
 vahiin is baat kii bhi koi guarantee nahin he ki elisi ke paas swatantra rup se bank chalaane kii kshamta he or vah janata ke paise ko surakshit rakhane main kisi anya sarkari bank se zyada sakasham he
 Deputy Commissioner of Police (north-west) Aslam Khan said that the 16-year-old boy had allegedly entered the house stealing valuables, but the owner of the house caught him and was beaten to death by the locals
 police adhikari ne bataaya ki is sambandh main bhalswa deyari thane main maamla darj kiya gaya he
 There is a good news for students studying in madrasa in Bihar
 rajya main bhale hi mukhyamantri nitish kumaar bhaajapa ke sahyog se sarkaar chalaa rahe hon lekin madrasa se maulavee or faukaania kii padhai kar rahe chaatro ko protsaahan raashi kii yojana par rajya cabinet ne apni muhar laga di
 At present, in Bihar, an amount of ten thousand is given to the students who pass the first class in matriculation and fifteen thousand to the first class students in intermediate
 rajya sarkaar ne alpsankhyak kalyaan vibhaag ke is prastaav par muhar lagaate hue vartmaan vittiya varsh se ise lagu karne kaa faisalaa kiya he
 Worldly education with Dini, two madrasas associated with virtual class room nitish kumaar kii sarkaar ke is faisale se nishchit rup se muslim samudaay ke logon main ek kushi kii lahar daudi hogi kyonki jab se wo bhaajapa ke saath gayi hai to unke man main nitish kumaar ke prati ek anischitata kaa maahaul he
 Although BJP ministers never opposed such a plan, there is always an allegation from RJD that Nitish Kumar is no longer behaving towards Muslims and minority communities
 tippaniyan Flag has been hoisted in darul-uloom Nizamia since 1947 rajd netaa shivanand tiwari ne mangalvaar ko ek sarkari kaarykram main nitish kumaar dwaara bagal kii masjid se ajaan ke baavjood bhaashan jari rakhane kaa hawala diya
 According to Tiwari, Nitish Kumar had made this rule in his party that the speech should never be continued during namaz or azaan but now he himself has forgotten this rule
 dini ke saath duniyavi talim bhi, virtual class room se jude do madrase This decision of Nitish Kumar's government will surely spark a happy wave among the people of the Muslim community as there has been an atmosphere of uncertainty towards Nitish Kumar since he has been with the BJP

 godhra cond ke baad hue ek dange kii jaanch kar rahi ‘vishesh jaanch team’ (esaiti) ke samaksh ravivaar ko gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke pesh nahin hone kii sambhaavna he
 Sources present in the state government said that the SIT has summoned Modi to appear before him yesterday on the complaint of Zakia Jaffy in the Gulberg Society riot case
 gauratlab he ki jakiya divangat saansad ehsaan jaafaree kii patni he
 The SIT has not received any information from the Chief Minister till Saturday evening
 esaiti pramukh aarake raghavan ne bataaya, ‘‘abhi tak modi kii ore se koi pratikriya nahin ai he
 On April 27 last year, the Supreme Court had asked the SIT to investigate Zakia's complaint under which he accused 62 people, including Modi and his cabinet colleagues, police officers and senior bureaucrats, that they helped in the riots
 And provoked riots, in which more than 1,000 people were killed
 farvari 2002 main bheed ne is purv saansad ehsaan jaafaree ko 69 anya logon ke saatha maut ke ghat ke utaar diya gaya tha
 On November 3, 2007, Zakia moved the apex court after the Gujarat High Court refused to issue any direction in this regard and asked him to seek redress in the magistrate's court
 usne arope lagaaya ki farvari or may 2002 ke bich bekasooron kii jaan bachaane ke prati rajya sarkaar jaanboojh kar or iradatan naakaam rahi
 Zakia told Surat today that while everyone is waiting for Modi to be questioned, they should appear before the inquiry committee
 congress mahasachiv or gujarat ke prabharee pi sudhakar reddy ne kaha, ‘‘jab vah 2007 main pun: sattarudh hue to unhone kaha tha ki vah mukhyamantri nahin balki ek aam aadmi hai
 When the summons of his name has been issued, he should appear before the sit and prove that he is a common man
 ’’ jakiya kii shikaayat kii jaanch karne vaale vishesh jaanch dal :sit: ko us samay kanoonee baadhyataaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha jab pichley saal july main bhartiya janata party ke vidhayak kaalu maliwada ne gujarat ucch nyaayalay kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha or jakiya jaafaree maamle main jaanch kar rahe sit kii gatividhiyon par roak lagane kii maang kii thi
 The High Court dismissed the petition, saying that SIT was acting directly under the supervision of the Supreme Court
 is maamle main koi raahat nahin di ja sakati he
 Malivada then moved the apex court and challenged the High Court verdict
 jakiya kii shikaayat ke sambandh main sit pehle hi unamem se kai logon ke bayaan darj kar chukaa he jinka naam unhone apni shikaayat main liya tha 
 The name of BJP MLA Malivada is also included in Zakia's complaint
