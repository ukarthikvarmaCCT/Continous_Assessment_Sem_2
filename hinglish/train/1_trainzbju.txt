 Playing with them is a pleasant experience and the credit goes to them
 ' unhone kaha, 'dhoni ne mujhe bataaya tha ki mujhe kisi khilaadi ke khilaaf kisi gendbaaji kerani he
 It worked and i like it
 ' Worship and worship is inhabited by the people of India
 shaayad kii aisa koi din gujarata hoga, jab koi khaas puja kaa sanyog na banataa ho
 There is also a law for special worship according to every day of the week
 shuukravaar ko lakshmi devi kaa vrath rakhaa jaataa he
 It is also called 'vaibhav Lakshmi Vrat'
 is vrath ko stri yaa purush, koi bhi kar saktaa he
 By observing this fast, the worshiper gets wealth and happiness
 ghar-parivaar main lakshmi kaa vaas banaae rakhane ke liye bhi yah vrath upyogi he
 On this day, men and women worship Lakshmi with white flowers, white sandalwood etc
 kheer se bhagwaan ko bhoga lagaakar prasad grahan karte hai
 On this fast, the worshiper should eat food at one time
 agar koi vyakti mata vaibhav lakshmi kaa vrath karne ke saath hi lakshmi shri yantra ko sthapit kar uski niyamit rup se puja karata he, to uske vyapaar main vruddhi ore dhan main badhotari hoti he
 Story of Vaibhav Lakshmi Vrat: Many people lived in a city
 sabhi apane-apane kaamon main lage rahete the
 Nobody cared about anyone
 bhajan-kirthan, bhakthi-bhav, dayaa-maaya, paroapkaar jaise sanskaar kam ho gaye
 The evils had increased in the city
 sharaab, jua, res, vyabhichaar, chori-dakaiti vagairah bahut se gunaah shahar main hote the
 Despite these, some good people also lived in the city
 aise hi logon main shila or unke pati kii gruhasthi maani jaati thi
 Sheela was of a religious nature and a contented nature
 unka pati bhi viveki or susheel tha
 Sheela and her husband never used to harm anyone and Prabhu was spending time in Bhajan
 shahar ke log unki gruhasthi kii saraahna karte the
 It changed while watching
 shila kaa pati bure logon se dosti kar baitha
 Now he started dreaming of becoming a millionaire as soon as possible
 isliye vah galat raste par chal padaa falswaroop vah rodpati ban gaya
 That is, he had become like a beggar wandering on the way
 sharaab, jua, res, charas-ganja vagairah buree aadaton main shila kaa pati bhi funs gaya
 He also got used to alcohol with friends
 is prakaar usne apana sab kuch res-jue main ganvaa diya
 Sheela felt very sad due to her husband's behavior, but she began to suffer everything by trusting in God
 vah apana adhikansh samay prabhu bhakthi main bitaane lagi
 Suddenly one day someone knocked at his door
 shila ne dwaar kholaa to dekha ki ek maanji khadi thi
 Supernatural sharpness was on his face
 unki aankhon main se maano amrit bah rahaa tha
 His grand face was brimming with compassion and love
 usko dekhte hi shila ke man main apaar shanti chaa gai
 There was joy in Sheela's romance
 shila us maanji ko aadar ke saath ghar main le ai
 There was nothing to sit in the house
 atah shila ne sakuchaakar ek fatty hui chaddar par usko bithaaya
 Manji said - Why Sheila! Do not recognize me? Every Friday i also come there during the bhajan-kirtan in Lakshmiji's temple
 ' iske baavjood shila kuch samaj nahin paa rahi thi
 Then Manji said- 'you have not come to the temple for a long time, so i went to see you
 'manji ke ati prembhre shabdon se shila kaa hriday pigal gaya
 Tears welled up in her eyes and she wept bitterly
 manji ne kaha- 'beti! sukh or dukh to dhoop or chaanv jaise hote hai
 Be patient daughter! Tell me all your problems 'manji ke vyavhaar se shila ko kaaphi sambal mila or sukh kii aas main usne manji ko apni sari kahani kah sunai
 Hearing the story, Manji said- 'the pace of karma is unique
 har insaan ko apane karm bhugatne hi padate hai
 So don't worry
 ab tu karm bhugat chuki he
 Now your happy days will definitely come
 tu to maan lakshmi kii bhakt he
 Maa Lakshmiji is the embodiment of love and compassion
 ve apane bhakton par hameshaa mamata rakhti hai
 Therefore, keep patience and observe Maa Lakshmiji fast
 isse sab kuch thik ho jayega
 'on Sheela's asking, Manji also told her the whole method of fasting
 manji ne kaha- 'beti! maa lakshmi kaa vrath bahut saral he
 She is called ‘varadalakshmi Vrat’ or ‘vaibhav Lakshmi Vrat’
 yah vrath karne vaale kii sab manokamana purna hoti he
 He gets pleasure and wealth
 'shila yah sunakar aanandit ho gai
 When Sheela opened her eyes with determination, there was no one in front of her
 vah vismit ho gai ki manji kahaan gayi? shila ko tatkaal yah samajhate der na lagi ki manji or koi nahin saakshaat lakshmi hi thim
 The second day was Friday
 sabere snaan karke svachh kapade pahanakar shila ne manji dwaara bataai vidhi se puure man se vrath kiya
 Prasad was distributed in the last
 yah prasad pehle pati ko khilaayaa
 The nature of the husband changed as soon as Prasad was eaten
 us din usne shila ko maaraa nahin, sataaya bhi nahin
 Sheela was very happy
 unke man main 'vaibhavalakshmi vrath' ke liye shraddha bad gai
 Sheela performed 'vaibhavalakshmi Vrat' till twenty-one Friday with full devotion and devotion
 ikkisven shuukravaar ko maanji ke kahe mutabik udhyapan vidhi kar ke saat striyon ko 'vaibhavalakshmi vrath' kii saat pustaken uphaar main deen
 Then after worshiping the image of 'dhanalakshmi Swaroop' of Mataji, she started praying in her heart with emotion - 'O Mother Dhanalakshmi! i made a vow to do 'vaibhavalakshmi Vrat', that fast is completed today
 he maa! meri har vipatti dur karo
 Welfare us all
 jise santan na ho, use santan dena
 Keeping the good luck of a lucky woman
 kunari ladki ko manabhaavan pati dena
 Whoever performs this miraculous Vaibhavalakshmi fast, remove all their troubles
 sabhi ko sukhi karnaa
 Hey mother! Your glory is immense
 ' aisa bolkar lakshmi ke 'dhanalakshmi swaroop' kii chhabi ko pranaam kiya
 With the effect of fasting, Sheela's husband became a good man and started working hard
 usne turant shila ke girvee rakhe gahane chhudaa liye
 There was a flood of money in the house
 ghar main pehle jaisi sukh-shanti chaa gai
 Seeing the effect of 'vaibhavalakshmi Vrat', other women of the locality also started doing 'vaibhavalakshmi Vrat' methodically
 'vaibhav lakshmi vrath' udhyapan vidhi:saat, gyaarah yaa ikkis, jitne bhi shuukravaaron kii mannath maangi ho, utane shuukravaar tak yah vrath puri shraddha tathaa bhaavana ke saath karnaa chahie
 On the last Friday, it should be done according to the classical method
 aakhri shuukravaar ko prasad ke liye kheer banani chahie
 The way we worship every Friday, we should do so
 pujan ke baad maan ke saamne ek shriphal phoden phir kam se kam saat kunari kanyaon yaa saubhagyashaalee striyon ko kumkum kaa tilak lagaakar maa vaibhavalakshmi vrath katha kii pustak kii ek-ek prati uphaar main deni chahie or sabko kheer kaa prasad dena chahie
 After this, Goddess Lakshmiji should bow with reverence
 phir mataji ke 'dhanalakshmi swaroop' kii chhabi ko vandan karke bhav se man hi man prarthana karen- 'he maa dhanalakshmi! maine aapkaa 'vaibhavalakshmi vrath' karne kii mannath maani thi, vah vrath aaj purna kiya he
 Hey mother! Complete our desire (whoever wishes)
 hamaari har vipatti dur karo
 Welfare us all
 jise santan na ho, use santan dena
 Keeping the good luck of a lucky woman
 kunari ladki ko manabhaavan pati dena
 Whoever performs this miraculous Vaibhavalakshmi fast, remove all their troubles

 Hey mother! Your glory is immense
 ' aapaki jai ho! aisa bolkar lakshmi ke 'dhanalakshmi swaroop' kii chhavi ko pranaam karen

 Everyone says that the GDP of our country is going to be fine, then why the BP of people is not decreasing
 pradhanmantri modi or reating agency mudi ke ashavad ko log samaj kyon nahin paa rahe hai
 Why get involved in such debates that even Moody is not bothered
 ghar vaapasi, lav jihad, ramajhaade, ashishnutaa, gau maance se hote hue bahason kaa mallayuddh deshbhakti, deshadrohi, azaadi se daaen baayen mudate hue ham ab bharat mata kii jai par aa gaye hai
 Taking breaks in between, they also debate on Vande Mataram, but the latest is who will speak and who will not
 acchhee baat he ki in sabake baavjood samarasata bani hui he, acchhee baat ye nahin he ki bina hasya ke ye rasata bani hui he
 It is important that we laugh
 apane upar, aapke upar or unke upar bhi jo khud ko bahut siriyasli lete hai
 Our name is that India will laugh, India will grow
 aap is mukhyalay ko to pahachaanate hi hai jahaan rose koi na koi bhaashan hota he magar hindi main hota he to wo kaaphi bada ho jaataa he
 The United Nations brings out a report on prosperity worldwide, in which happiness is also found in countries that are malnourished
 2012 se sanyukt raashtra ko khyaal aayaa he ki heppiness index nikaala jaae
 Its India position is 118th
 157 deshon main ham 118wein number par hai
 Why are we so happy
 kya ham bhartiya 117 deshon ke hansane ke baad hansate hai
 They wait to first take Denmark goose and then go to Switzerland and then laugh
 bilkul galat baat he
 The limit is reached
 is suchi ko dekha to pakistan bhi hamase pehle hansata he
 He is at number 92
 china to pakistan or bharat donon se pehle hansata he yani 83 number par he
 i am unable to bear that my own India, where there is so much war over Mother India, is a victim of misfortune in terms of happiness
 log kehete hai ki padosi kii irshyaa se bhi sukh miltaa he
 If India looks back on the number 118, Myanmar is on the 119th
 unke yahaan to loktantr ajtak aa hi rahaa he
 How long have we been here prasannataa mantralay aapane suna hi hoga
 Many people in the world cry in the name of Saudi Arabia, but Saudi Arabia, ranked number 34 on the Happiness Index, created a Ministry of Happiness in February this year
 farvari se april aa gaya ab jaakar bharat main isaki nakal hui he
 Thanks to the copycat
 madhyapradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne elaan kiya ki unke rajya main bhi prasannataa mantralay hoga jo rajya ke vikaas kaa moolyankan karegaa ki log khush hai ki nahin
 But no comic poet of the country took it seriously, i can understand it because CM Chauhan announced it on April 1
 prasannataa par jab matraalay ban saktaa he to aap prasannataa prime time kyon nahin dekh sakate hai
 What would happen in the ministry of happiness? log hansate hi rahete honge
 On the condition of others and also on their condition
 mane puch rahe hai
 So let's start
 ham abhi se bataa dete hai ki hamaara iraadaa bilkul sabhi kaa dil dukhaane kaa he
 Because no one in the world can laugh at those whose suffering means
 airport sajaane kii anumati nahin mili hogi isliye ye log band baaja lekar aa gaye
 Welcome the coming
 sardaar vallabh bhai patel airport par koun aane vaala tha jisaki aguwai main itane log aa gaye hai
 Decorated the car in this way
 chaliye ges kiijie
 Waiting for whom a lot of tricolor flag is being waved
 doosraa ges kiijie, kiske intazaar main ye log bharat mata kii jai kaa poster liye khadey hai
 Make a third decision for whom these people have come wearing a new T-shirt
 thik se dekhiye is tishart ko
 a photo of the visitor is also made
 ye aadhaar-tishart nahin he magar photo se pataa chalata he ki gujarat ke ipies adhikari di ji vanjaaraa ahmedabad aa rahe hai
 Vanzara Saheb was in jail in many fake encounters
 kuch saal pehle mumbai kii jail main bhej die gaye
 Came out on bail a few days ago and made his entry grand when he was allowed to go to Gujarat from Mumbai
 vanjaaraa sahab ne kaha he ki unka swaagat sabhi deshbhakton kaa swaagat he
 All patriots should see properly that they have been welcomed
 agar vanjaaraa kii tarah encounter ke aarope main jail jane kaa mauka nahin bhi mila he to bhi is swaagat ko sweekaar to kar hi sakate hai
 Think how welcome it will be when they are acquitted
 yahi nahin jail main rahete rahete vanjaaraa apane sarvice revolver ko bhi kaaphi miss karte honge
 Perhaps that's why when he came out of the Ahmedabad airport, he came to an event and presented a sample of Talwar Dance on stage
 talwaar lekar aise naachte rahe jaise koi yuddh jeet kar aae hon
 India has been a priest of peace but it is not that people have forgotten to use swords
 jab duulhe talwaar lekar shaadi karne ja sakate hai to jail se aane par aap kisi ko talwaar dance karne se kaise roak sakate hai
 You can laugh at this picture because there is no use crying
 ye bharat main bilkul ho saktaa he
 By the way, Banjara saheb seems to be swearing at the sword, even after spending so many years in jail, he has not forgotten his old habits
 ab hamen ye nahin pataa ki bhartiya jelon main kaidiyon ko talwaar bhaanjane kii training di jaati he yaa nahin
 Hats off to him and you to coffee with Karan show, you must have seen
 chaay pe charchaa ke bare main to aapane suna hi hoga
 Did you hear Coffee with Captain? chaay se baat ab coffee par ja pahunchi he
 If Modi ji comes from Assam then he will say that Congress is a party of rich people
 coffee piti he
 Coffee is served
 kahaan se paisa aayaa
 Friends, we cannot drink enough
 hamen chanda dijie
 We are poor people, that's why i used to sell tea
 phir jhagada pahonchega suut ke daam par or maalya ke jahaaz par
 Before this, we get enough with Captain P
 vaise punjab main log jo pinaa pansad karte hai use bihar main bain kar diya gaya he
 But Punjab has captains
 pehle bhi hockey ke captain hue
 Captain of cricket but no coffee with captain
 congress ke netaa he amarinder singh
 i think he was very worried about stealing Prime Minister Modi's style, but Modi has such copyright on selling tea that it is very difficult for a leader to duplicate
 nateeja ye idia aayaa he coffee vid captain
 Prime Minister Modi recently said that he used to sell tea in Assam
 do saal tak chaay kii charchaa hui lekin na to piem ne bataaya na logon ne unase poocha ki aap koun si chaay bechate the
 The PM himself told that he used to sell Assam tea
 ve akele chaay vaale hai jinhen aaj tak yaad he ki bees pachis yaa tees saal pehle ve kis jagah kii chaay bechate the
 If they do not remember, they could have also named Darjeeling Tea but did not take it
 aap jaanate hai ki punjab main coffee nahin hoti he
 Which tea is in Gujarat? coffee hoti he karnataka main
 The Congress Chief Minister of Karnataka will be upset that he is the one who grows coffee and has been the yellow captain
 hamane suna he ki punjab main koi coffee pine vaala nahin mil rahaa he
 It is possible that Captain Saheb may leave on the set of Koffee with Karan until it is found
 karan johar thodaa apaset honge lekin punjab kii kasam dilaa dene se ve set chhod sakate hai
 Then discuss with her a lot from Shilpa to Kareena in front of them
 coffee vid captain hit ho gaya to coffee vid karan kaa kya hoga
 This is not the time to think
 pine kaa time he
 It could also be that Coffee with Karan can also be shown in Congress Village Village
 lokapriy sho rahaa he kya pataa isi se andhere badal chant jaaen yani hat jaaen
 This is the advantage of ruling for sixty years
 tabhi congress kaaphi pilaa rahi he
 Wait a few days, the BJP will also feed
 vaise bijepi ne ke pi maury ko upi kaa adhyaksh banaaya he
 Maurya saheb writes in his curriculum vitae that he used to sell tea as a child
 un par das aapraadhik mukademe bhi hai
 By the way, you should focus on tea
 chaay bechney se bijepi main kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 i do not know what will happen by selling coffee in Congress
 khabar ai he ki rashtriya lok dal kaa janata dal unitate main vilay hone vaala he
 National Lok Dal leader Ajit Singh is merging with his party after a long time
 abhi tak ve gathbandhan karte the or mantri banakar kisi bhi sarkaar main wilin ho jate the
 My own guess is that if you are bored by merging alone then this time you have made a plan to merge your party
 ajit singh kii kismat bahut kam kii hoti he
 He has an excellent cabinet and portfolio of photographs
 is photo main ve akhilesh yadav kii peeth par haath rakh rahe hai
 In this photo he is with Amar Singh
 is photo main ve rahul gandhi ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Prakash Karat
 is photo main ve rajnath singh ke saath hai
 Baba is with Ramdev in this photo
 is photo main ve mayawati ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Nitish Kumar
 ab ve akele saath nahin he
 His party is also with Nitish now
 agar is tarah netaa apni party kaa vilay karne lage to rashtriya partiyon kaa akelaapan bad jayega
 Think who will go to the BJP and Congress alliance
 jo bhi he ajit singh kaa raajnneetik album dekhnaa ho to time lekar unke paas jaaiyegaa
 In 1998, he formed the Rashtriya Lok Dal
 18 saal party chalaane ke baad, kai dalon va netaaon ke saath rahane ke baad ajit singh ab apni party chalaane kii zimmedaari nitish kumaar ko saunp rahe hai
 National as well as international news
 bharat main ho rahi bharat mata kii jai kii charchaa se antarrashtriya str par logon kii ummiden bad gai he
 Many people here have said that if you want to live in India, then Bharat Mata ki Jai will have to be spoken
 ise sunate hi europe main halchal much rahi he
 There people have started talking about turning their bus and boat towards India
 europe ke sharnaarthiyon ne jab se suna he ki bharat main rahane ke liye bharat mata kii jai bolnaa hoga ve kaaphi utsahit nazar aa rahe hai
 Millions of people from Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, Albania, Nigeria, Iran and Ukraine are applying to become refugees in Europe
 inamen se sabase zyada log germany main rahanaa chaahate hai
 Over four and a half million people have applied to live in Germany
 agar inhen pataa chal gaya ki bharat se koi ye ofer kar rahaa he ki sirf bharat mata kii jai kehane se bharat main rahane kaa mauka mil saktaa he to sharnaarthi apni naaven bharat kii taraf mode sakate hai
 India can also open Bharat Mata Ki Jai counter instead of visa counter in embassies
 jo bhi sharnaarthi is counter par aakar bharat mata kii jai bolegaa use bharat jane kaa visa diya ja saktaa he
 This would be the easiest rule to grant visas worldwide
 parinde pareshaan hai
 At the election rally in Assam, the BJP president said that if our government comes, even Parinda from Bangladesh will not be able to kill her
 ajmal se problem to samaj aata he, magar parindon se kya problem he
 The councils felt that there was no talk of Parinda free India
 sunate hi dephence colony ke fliover par parinde sar jhukaa kar khamosh ho gaye
 They started thinking about where they got caught in the political quarrel of humans
 kisi ko koi rasta nahin sujh rahaa tha
 So, in this only one Udyan Ratna Awardee, Chinde Parinde found a solution
 chuun chuun parinde ne kaha ki ye hamaare udne ke adhikaar par hamalaa he
 What will we do if we do not kill Parinde? ye akaash kiske liye he
 Who is this land for? ham parindon kaa koi mulk nahin hota
 We have a sky
 ham chahen to pakistan jaaen, chahen to bangladesh jaaen or shaam ko lautakar bharat aa jaaen
 Distressed birds kept flying, sometimes returning
 tay hua ki chuun chuun parinda amit shah ke is bayaan ke virodh main apana udan ratna puraskaar waapas karegaa
 In front of the media, birds have also expressed their opposition by flying away
 insaanon se kaha he ki ve parindon ke par ko simaaon main na baandhen
 If humans want to stop then stop
 unke naam par ham parindon ko na roke
 Now Amit Shah is afraid that the Aam Aadmi Party should not support this opposition of the birds
 kahin inhen kumaar vishwaas kavita sunaakar galat raste par na bhatka de
 Maneka Gandhi, a sensitive minister for birds and pets, has not broken her silence
 is bich bharat mata kii jai nahin bolne waalon ko kya sazaa di jaae ise lekar kanfusion ho gaya he
 Be sent out of the country, beheaded or jawed
 pehle do prakaar kii sazaayen to charchaa main aa chuki hai, jai nahin bolne par jabada ukhaadne kaa idia abhi abhi aayaa he
 This news appeared in Friday's Indian Express
 chhattisgarh ke ek mantri hai brijmohan agarwal
 He feels that Baba Ramdev did not like the idea of cutting his neck
 agarwal ne usase thodaa peeche rahete hue kaha ki hamaare kaaryakartaaon ke saamne agar koi rashtravirohi naare lagayegaa to ham unke jabade ko ukhaadne kii takat rakhte hai
 If you have taken birth on the land of India
 hindustan kii dharti kaa ann kha rahe ho or tumhaare marane ke baad bhi tumhen agar do gaz zamin milegi to hindustan kii dharti par milegi isliye bharat mata kii jai bolnaa padegaa
 i had heard of breaking the jaw, the copyright of uprooting seems to be that of Agrawal
 hamane ek dentist se poocha ki jabada kaise ukhada jaataa he
 So he said that in a very serious case, the jaw is broken
 ek dedh ghante kii surgery hoti he
 If BJP workers spend so much time, then they can miss the target of downloading one lakh Namo app in every district
 wo dentist kaa kaam karenge to downlod kab karenge
 Amit Shah has said that every district should have one lakh Namo app downloads
 itani takalif sahakar naa bolne se kya milane vaala he
 It is better not to say no to Jai
 bolne kii maang karne vaale kitne naaraaz ho gaye hai
 Those who say nothing should think
 swami agnivesh ne baba ramdev ke bayaan par indian express main ek lekh likhaa he ki unka sar kaatane vaala bayaan dharm virdohi he
 i became Prof
 Ramdev while reading Agnivesh ji
 agar baba maanavtaa ko pyaar na karte to maanav ke khaane ke liye achaar, biscuit yaa aataa nahin banaate
 His anger is not understood by Agnivesh
 baba ko pataa he ki lakhon sar kaat denge to noodles khaane vaale kam ho jaaenge
 Still they are unable to bear this anger
 ganimat he ki desh main samvidhan he
 He said that there is a law in this country, if not your one, we can cut the neck of millions
 mujhe puraa yakeen he ki baba aisa nahin karenge
 Have said in anger
 swami agnivesh kaa lekh padhakar praayshchit karenge
 Who will harm their flour and noodles by cutting millions of heads
 kuch to he ki baba ko kaala dhan na aane par bhi itnaa gussa nahin aayaa
 No speakers are no less
 nahin bolnaa he to na bolen, baba ke saamne jaakar bolnaa zaruri he ki nahin bolenge
 Khwamkhah why do you want to put your head in the risk zone, brother
 himachal ke mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke kai maamalon kii jaanch chal rahi he
 He has also confused Congress three times by uttering Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 virbhadra singh ne kaha ki main sachcha deshbhakt hum
 i am a nationalist at heart
 bijepi bhi virbhadra singh ke bharat mata kii jai bolne se kanphyus he
 She is unable to understand whether to criticize or to welcome
 virbhadra singh ne kaha he ki ve ab har samaaroh main bharat mata kii jai kaa naaraa lagaayenge
 Meanwhile, the Kohinoor diamond has come under nationalism
 kohinoor par bharat ke log or news agencia daawa karti rahi hai lekin supreme court kii ek tippanee se bhartiya rashtrawaad kaa kohinoor paksh sankat main pad saktaa he
 a petition has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking to bring Kohinoor to India
 yachikaaon ke liye mashhoor subramanyam swami or prashanth bhushan ne ye yachika daayar nahin kii he
 The All India Human Rights and Social Justice Front has filed
 yachikakarta ne british ucchayukta ko bhi party banane kii baat kahi he
 The Supreme Court has said that many countries including South Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh have asserted their right to Kohinoor
 sarkaar ko jo karnaa tha usne kiya he
 Nevertheless the solicitor general has been asked for opinion
 ab aisa hira kyon maang rahe hai jis par kai deshon kaa daawa he
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, famous for not speaking, has advised the current Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is famous for speaking
 kaha he ki bolne se zyaada mahatv karne kaa hota he
 Manmohan Singh has said to give this advice to Modi ji, this is news
 2014 ke chunaav se pehle modi ji manmohan singh se kaha karte the ki kuch kiya bhi he to bolaa bhi kiijie
 When Modi ji kept silent on some issues in the middle, the Congress leaders started remembering Manmohan Singh and started calling Modi ji as Silent Modi
 samaj hi nahin aayaa ki ve modi ji kii aalochana kar rahe hai yaa apane purv pradhanmantri kii
 Modi ji would have been confused because of saying silent Modi, so he did not speak on many issues
 is bich vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha he ki jinke naam panama papers main aae hai unki raaton kii neend ud jaaegi
 My advice to such people is to read the Indian Express early in the morning in which Panama is printing something on the papers every day and sleep in the day itself so that there is no problem if you do not sleep at night
 ab badhate hai agali khabar par
 India will laugh, India will grow
 shuukravaar ke hamaare is naare ko aap start ap india, stand ap india se na joden
 Our aim is to reduce the bitterness about political debates
 har baat ko tathyon ke paimaane par na parakhen
 You know that two people have run away
 ek to videsh bhaag gaye hai or ek desh main he magar pataa nahin chal rahaa he
 If you have seen a Modi government minister YS Chaudhary at a bus stand, then immediately inform the Telangana police
 choudhary sahab ko adaalat ne teen teen saman bheje lekin ve haazir nahin ho sake
 He is the Minister of State for Science and Technology in the Union Cabinet
 meraa apana hasya anumaan he ki ve kisi science lab main chhipe ho sakate hai
 a bank in Mauritius has complained against him that Chaudhary Ji is not paying his loan
 saim tu saim bhartiya bainkon ne shikaayat kii he ki maalya sahab unka lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Is it not that both of them have disappeared under the exchange program
 choudhary ji ke khilaaf gair jamaanti warrant jari hua he
 They have also not been removed from the cabinet because they do not know whether they can get this part in the greed of the minister
 mantri ji ne adaalat se kaha he ki unhen dilli main kuch zaruri kaam he isliye court nahin aa paa rahe hai
 i have full faith in the Minister's statement because he has spoken about the honor of the judiciary
 isliye bharosa he kyonki vaai es choudhary par sirf 106 karod kii dendaree he wo bhi duusare mulk ke bank kii
 Mallya sir has run away with 9000 crores, think how much the heart of banks will be beating
 is ghabrahat main bainkon ne maalya ke prastaav ko thukraa diya he
 Mallya had said that he could give Rs 4000 crore by September
 bainko ne kaha lenge to puraa paisa lenge
 Think Mauritius bank is reaching Hyderabad and getting warrant issued against loan defaulters, our banks are expecting Mallya to send money of India to India while abroad
 iaiti ke chaatro ke liye mahangi fees dena aasaan ho gaya he
 Listen carefully
 general chaatro kii fees 90,000 se badhaakar do lakh kar di gai he
 But there is no problem in giving two lakhs to the students, so the students of IIT will get loan without interest
 aane vaale samay main baaki sansthaanon ke chaatr bhi is laajawab suvidha kii maang kar sakate hai
 If the interest will be waived by adding the money that will be of interest, then they will not even know that the fees have increased
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay ko badhai deni chahie ki teen guna fees badhaane ke prastaav ko naamanzoor kar diya he
 The fees have been increased only twice
 baaki chaatro ke liye fees maaf bhi kar di gai he
 Hansega India Badhega India Show is not local
 isamen international news bhi he
 a big UK government advisor has said that obesity is not a problem of the fat man
 ye samasya us mote aadmi ke kaaran nahin he jiske zyaada khaane se motaa hua he
 There has been a news report in the Telegraph newspaper that there is no fault of obese people that they do not eat less
 iskaa doshi vahi paryaavaran he jisase ladane ke liye dilli main od evan phir se launch ho rahaa he
 It is okay that one cannot control overeating, but obesity is not due to the national decline of willpower

 The United Nations brings out a report on prosperity worldwide, in which happiness is also found in countries that are malnourished
 2012 se sanyukt raashtra ko khyaal aayaa he ki heppiness index nikaala jaae
 Its India position is 118th
 157 deshon main ham 118wein number par hai
 Why are we so happy
 kya ham bhartiya 117 deshon ke hansane ke baad hansate hai
 They wait to first take Denmark goose and then go to Switzerland and then laugh
 bilkul galat baat he
 The limit is reached
 is suchi ko dekha to pakistan bhi hamase pehle hansata he
 He is at number 92
 china to pakistan or bharat donon se pehle hansata he yani 83 number par he
 i am unable to bear that my own India, where there is so much war over Mother India, is a victim of misfortune in terms of happiness
 log kehete hai ki padosi kii irshyaa se bhi sukh miltaa he
 If India looks back on the number 118, Myanmar is on the 119th
 unke yahaan to loktantr ajtak aa hi rahaa he
 How long have we been here prasannataa mantralay aapane suna hi hoga

 a photo of the visitor is also made
 ye aadhaar-tishart nahin he magar photo se pataa chalata he ki gujarat ke ipies adhikari di ji vanjaaraa ahmedabad aa rahe hai
 Vanzara Saheb was in jail in many fake encounters
 kuch saal pehle mumbai kii jail main bhej die gaye
 Came out on bail a few days ago and made his entry grand when he was allowed to go to Gujarat from Mumbai
 vanjaaraa sahab ne kaha he ki unka swaagat sabhi deshbhakton kaa swaagat he
 All patriots should see properly that they have been welcomed
 agar vanjaaraa kii tarah encounter ke aarope main jail jane kaa mauka nahin bhi mila he to bhi is swaagat ko sweekaar to kar hi sakate hai
 Think how welcome it will be when they are acquitted
 yahi nahin jail main rahete rahete vanjaaraa apane sarvice revolver ko bhi kaaphi miss karte honge
 Perhaps that's why when he came out of the Ahmedabad airport, he came to an event and presented a sample of Talwar Dance on stage

 India has been a priest of peace but it is not that people have forgotten to use swords
 jab duulhe talwaar lekar shaadi karne ja sakate hai to jail se aane par aap kisi ko talwaar dance karne se kaise roak sakate hai
 You can laugh at this picture because there is no use crying
 ye bharat main bilkul ho saktaa he
 By the way, Banjara saheb seems to be swearing at the sword, even after spending so many years in jail, he has not forgotten his old habits
 ab hamen ye nahin pataa ki bhartiya jelon main kaidiyon ko talwaar bhaanjane kii training di jaati he yaa nahin
 Hats off to him and you to coffee with Karan show, you must have seen

 Did you hear Coffee with Captain? chaay se baat ab coffee par ja pahunchi he
 If Modi ji comes from Assam then he will say that Congress is a party of rich people
 coffee piti he
 Coffee is served
 kahaan se paisa aayaa
 Friends, we cannot drink enough
 hamen chanda dijie
 We are poor people, that's why i used to sell tea
 phir jhagada pahonchega suut ke daam par or maalya ke jahaaz par
 Before this, we get enough with Captain P
 vaise punjab main log jo pinaa pansad karte hai use bihar main bain kar diya gaya he
 But Punjab has captains
 pehle bhi hockey ke captain hue
 Captain of cricket but no coffee with captain
 congress ke netaa he amarinder singh
 i think he was very worried about stealing Prime Minister Modi's style, but Modi has such copyright on selling tea that it is very difficult for a leader to duplicate
 nateeja ye idia aayaa he coffee vid captain
 Prime Minister Modi recently said that he used to sell tea in Assam
 do saal tak chaay kii charchaa hui lekin na to piem ne bataaya na logon ne unase poocha ki aap koun si chaay bechate the
 The PM himself told that he used to sell Assam tea
 ve akele chaay vaale hai jinhen aaj tak yaad he ki bees pachis yaa tees saal pehle ve kis jagah kii chaay bechate the
 If they do not remember, they could have also named Darjeeling Tea but did not take it
 aap jaanate hai ki punjab main coffee nahin hoti he
 Which tea is in Gujarat? coffee hoti he karnataka main
 The Congress Chief Minister of Karnataka will be upset that he is the one who grows coffee and has been the yellow captain
 hamane suna he ki punjab main koi coffee pine vaala nahin mil rahaa he
 It is possible that Captain Saheb may leave on the set of Koffee with Karan until it is found
 karan johar thodaa apaset honge lekin punjab kii kasam dilaa dene se ve set chhod sakate hai
 Then discuss with her a lot from Shilpa to Kareena in front of them
 coffee vid captain hit ho gaya to coffee vid karan kaa kya hoga
 This is not the time to think
 pine kaa time he
 It could also be that Coffee with Karan can also be shown in Congress Village Village
 lokapriy sho rahaa he kya pataa isi se andhere badal chant jaaen yani hat jaaen
 This is the advantage of ruling for sixty years
 tabhi congress kaaphi pilaa rahi he
 Wait a few days, the BJP will also feed
 vaise bijepi ne ke pi maury ko upi kaa adhyaksh banaaya he
 Maurya saheb writes in his curriculum vitae that he used to sell tea as a child
 un par das aapraadhik mukademe bhi hai
 By the way, you should focus on tea
 chaay bechney se bijepi main kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 i do not know what will happen by selling coffee in Congress
 khabar ai he ki rashtriya lok dal kaa janata dal unitate main vilay hone vaala he
 National Lok Dal leader Ajit Singh is merging with his party after a long time
 abhi tak ve gathbandhan karte the or mantri banakar kisi bhi sarkaar main wilin ho jate the
 My own guess is that if you are bored by merging alone then this time you have made a plan to merge your party
 ajit singh kii kismat bahut kam kii hoti he
 He has an excellent cabinet and portfolio of photographs
 is photo main ve akhilesh yadav kii peeth par haath rakh rahe hai
 In this photo he is with Amar Singh
 is photo main ve rahul gandhi ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Prakash Karat
 is photo main ve rajnath singh ke saath hai
 Baba is with Ramdev in this photo
 is photo main ve mayawati ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Nitish Kumar
 ab ve akele saath nahin he
 His party is also with Nitish now
 agar is tarah netaa apni party kaa vilay karne lage to rashtriya partiyon kaa akelaapan bad jayega
 Think who will go to the BJP and Congress alliance
 jo bhi he ajit singh kaa raajnneetik album dekhnaa ho to time lekar unke paas jaaiyegaa
 In 1998, he formed the Rashtriya Lok Dal
 18 saal party chalaane ke baad, kai dalon va netaaon ke saath rahane ke baad ajit singh ab apni party chalaane kii zimmedaari nitish kumaar ko saunp rahe hai
 National as well as international news
 bharat main ho rahi bharat mata kii jai kii charchaa se antarrashtriya str par logon kii ummiden bad gai he
 Many people here have said that if you want to live in India, then Bharat Mata ki Jai will have to be spoken
 ise sunate hi europe main halchal much rahi he
 There people have started talking about turning their bus and boat towards India
 europe ke sharnaarthiyon ne jab se suna he ki bharat main rahane ke liye bharat mata kii jai bolnaa hoga ve kaaphi utsahit nazar aa rahe hai
 Millions of people from Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, Albania, Nigeria, Iran and Ukraine are applying to become refugees in Europe
 inamen se sabase zyada log germany main rahanaa chaahate hai
 Over four and a half million people have applied to live in Germany
 agar inhen pataa chal gaya ki bharat se koi ye ofer kar rahaa he ki sirf bharat mata kii jai kehane se bharat main rahane kaa mauka mil saktaa he to sharnaarthi apni naaven bharat kii taraf mode sakate hai
 India can also open Bharat Mata Ki Jai counter instead of visa counter in embassies
 jo bhi sharnaarthi is counter par aakar bharat mata kii jai bolegaa use bharat jane kaa visa diya ja saktaa he
 This would be the easiest rule to grant visas worldwide
 parinde pareshaan hai
 At the election rally in Assam, the BJP president said that if our government comes, even Parinda from Bangladesh will not be able to kill her
 ajmal se problem to samaj aata he, magar parindon se kya problem he
 The councils felt that there was no talk of Parinda free India
 sunate hi dephence colony ke fliover par parinde sar jhukaa kar khamosh ho gaye
 They started thinking about where they got caught in the political quarrel of humans
 kisi ko koi rasta nahin sujh rahaa tha
 So, in this only one Udyan Ratna Awardee, Chinde Parinde found a solution
 chuun chuun parinde ne kaha ki ye hamaare udne ke adhikaar par hamalaa he
 What will we do if we do not kill Parinde? ye akaash kiske liye he
 Who is this land for? ham parindon kaa koi mulk nahin hota
 We have a sky
 ham chahen to pakistan jaaen, chahen to bangladesh jaaen or shaam ko lautakar bharat aa jaaen
 Distressed birds kept flying, sometimes returning
 tay hua ki chuun chuun parinda amit shah ke is bayaan ke virodh main apana udan ratna puraskaar waapas karegaa
 In front of the media, birds have also expressed their opposition by flying away
 insaanon se kaha he ki ve parindon ke par ko simaaon main na baandhen
 If humans want to stop then stop
 unke naam par ham parindon ko na roke
 Now Amit Shah is afraid that the Aam Aadmi Party should not support this opposition of the birds
 kahin inhen kumaar vishwaas kavita sunaakar galat raste par na bhatka de
 Maneka Gandhi, a sensitive minister for birds and pets, has not broken her silence
 is bich bharat mata kii jai nahin bolne waalon ko kya sazaa di jaae ise lekar kanfusion ho gaya he
 Be sent out of the country, beheaded or jawed
 pehle do prakaar kii sazaayen to charchaa main aa chuki hai, jai nahin bolne par jabada ukhaadne kaa idia abhi abhi aayaa he
 This news appeared in Friday's Indian Express
 chhattisgarh ke ek mantri hai brijmohan agarwal
 He feels that Baba Ramdev did not like the idea of cutting his neck
 agarwal ne usase thodaa peeche rahete hue kaha ki hamaare kaaryakartaaon ke saamne agar koi rashtravirohi naare lagayegaa to ham unke jabade ko ukhaadne kii takat rakhte hai
 If you have taken birth on the land of India
 hindustan kii dharti kaa ann kha rahe ho or tumhaare marane ke baad bhi tumhen agar do gaz zamin milegi to hindustan kii dharti par milegi isliye bharat mata kii jai bolnaa padegaa
 i had heard of breaking the jaw, the copyright of uprooting seems to be that of Agrawal
 hamane ek dentist se poocha ki jabada kaise ukhada jaataa he
 So he said that in a very serious case, the jaw is broken
 ek dedh ghante kii surgery hoti he
 If BJP workers spend so much time, then they can miss the target of downloading one lakh Namo app in every district
 wo dentist kaa kaam karenge to downlod kab karenge
 Amit Shah has said that every district should have one lakh Namo app downloads
 itani takalif sahakar naa bolne se kya milane vaala he
 It is better not to say no to Jai
 bolne kii maang karne vaale kitne naaraaz ho gaye hai
 Those who say nothing should think
 swami agnivesh ne baba ramdev ke bayaan par indian express main ek lekh likhaa he ki unka sar kaatane vaala bayaan dharm virdohi he
 i became Prof
 Ramdev while reading Agnivesh ji
 agar baba maanavtaa ko pyaar na karte to maanav ke khaane ke liye achaar, biscuit yaa aataa nahin banaate
 His anger is not understood by Agnivesh
 baba ko pataa he ki lakhon sar kaat denge to noodles khaane vaale kam ho jaaenge
 Still they are unable to bear this anger
 ganimat he ki desh main samvidhan he
 He said that there is a law in this country, if not your one, we can cut the neck of millions
 mujhe puraa yakeen he ki baba aisa nahin karenge
 Have said in anger
 swami agnivesh kaa lekh padhakar praayshchit karenge
 Who will harm their flour and noodles by cutting millions of heads
 kuch to he ki baba ko kaala dhan na aane par bhi itnaa gussa nahin aayaa
 No speakers are no less
 nahin bolnaa he to na bolen, baba ke saamne jaakar bolnaa zaruri he ki nahin bolenge
 Khwamkhah why do you want to put your head in the risk zone, brother
 himachal ke mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke kai maamalon kii jaanch chal rahi he
 He has also confused Congress three times by uttering Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 virbhadra singh ne kaha ki main sachcha deshbhakt hum
 i am a nationalist at heart
 bijepi bhi virbhadra singh ke bharat mata kii jai bolne se kanphyus he
 She is unable to understand whether to criticize or to welcome
 virbhadra singh ne kaha he ki ve ab har samaaroh main bharat mata kii jai kaa naaraa lagaayenge
 Meanwhile, the Kohinoor diamond has come under nationalism
 kohinoor par bharat ke log or news agencia daawa karti rahi hai lekin supreme court kii ek tippanee se bhartiya rashtrawaad kaa kohinoor paksh sankat main pad saktaa he
 a petition has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking to bring Kohinoor to India
 yachikaaon ke liye mashhoor subramanyam swami or prashanth bhushan ne ye yachika daayar nahin kii he
 The All India Human Rights and Social Justice Front has filed
 yachikakarta ne british ucchayukta ko bhi party banane kii baat kahi he
 The Supreme Court has said that many countries including South Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh have asserted their right to Kohinoor
 sarkaar ko jo karnaa tha usne kiya he
 Nevertheless the solicitor general has been asked for opinion
 ab aisa hira kyon maang rahe hai jis par kai deshon kaa daawa he
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, famous for not speaking, has advised the current Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is famous for speaking
 kaha he ki bolne se zyaada mahatv karne kaa hota he
 Manmohan Singh has said to give this advice to Modi ji, this is news
 2014 ke chunaav se pehle modi ji manmohan singh se kaha karte the ki kuch kiya bhi he to bolaa bhi kiijie
 When Modi ji kept silent on some issues in the middle, the Congress leaders started remembering Manmohan Singh and started calling Modi ji as Silent Modi
 samaj hi nahin aayaa ki ve modi ji kii aalochana kar rahe hai yaa apane purv pradhanmantri kii
 Modi ji would have been confused because of saying silent Modi, so he did not speak on many issues
 is bich vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha he ki jinke naam panama papers main aae hai unki raaton kii neend ud jaaegi
 My advice to such people is to read the Indian Express early in the morning in which Panama is printing something on the papers every day and sleep in the day itself so that there is no problem if you do not sleep at night
 ab badhate hai agali khabar par
 India will laugh, India will grow
 shuukravaar ke hamaare is naare ko aap start ap india, stand ap india se na joden
 Our aim is to reduce the bitterness about political debates
 har baat ko tathyon ke paimaane par na parakhen
 You know that two people have run away
 ek to videsh bhaag gaye hai or ek desh main he magar pataa nahin chal rahaa he
 If you have seen a Modi government minister YS Chaudhary at a bus stand, then immediately inform the Telangana police
 choudhary sahab ko adaalat ne teen teen saman bheje lekin ve haazir nahin ho sake
 He is the Minister of State for Science and Technology in the Union Cabinet
 meraa apana hasya anumaan he ki ve kisi science lab main chhipe ho sakate hai
 a bank in Mauritius has complained against him that Chaudhary Ji is not paying his loan
 saim tu saim bhartiya bainkon ne shikaayat kii he ki maalya sahab unka lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Is it not that both of them have disappeared under the exchange program
 choudhary ji ke khilaaf gair jamaanti warrant jari hua he
 They have also not been removed from the cabinet because they do not know whether they can get this part in the greed of the minister
 mantri ji ne adaalat se kaha he ki unhen dilli main kuch zaruri kaam he isliye court nahin aa paa rahe hai
 i have full faith in the Minister's statement because he has spoken about the honor of the judiciary
 isliye bharosa he kyonki vaai es choudhary par sirf 106 karod kii dendaree he wo bhi duusare mulk ke bank kii
 Mallya sir has run away with 9000 crores, think how much the heart of banks will be beating
 is ghabrahat main bainkon ne maalya ke prastaav ko thukraa diya he
 Mallya had said that he could give Rs 4000 crore by September
 bainko ne kaha lenge to puraa paisa lenge
 Think Mauritius bank is reaching Hyderabad and getting warrant issued against loan defaulters, our banks are expecting Mallya to send money of India to India while abroad
 iaiti ke chaatro ke liye mahangi fees dena aasaan ho gaya he
 Listen carefully
 general chaatro kii fees 90,000 se badhaakar do lakh kar di gai he
 But there is no problem in giving two lakhs to the students, so the students of IIT will get loan without interest
 aane vaale samay main baaki sansthaanon ke chaatr bhi is laajawab suvidha kii maang kar sakate hai
 If the interest will be waived by adding the money that will be of interest, then they will not even know that the fees have increased
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay ko badhai deni chahie ki teen guna fees badhaane ke prastaav ko naamanzoor kar diya he
 The fees have been increased only twice
 baaki chaatro ke liye fees maaf bhi kar di gai he
 Hansega India Badhega India Show is not local
 isamen international news bhi he
 a big UK government advisor has said that obesity is not a problem of the fat man
 ye samasya us mote aadmi ke kaaran nahin he jiske zyaada khaane se motaa hua he
 There has been a news report in the Telegraph newspaper that there is no fault of obese people that they do not eat less
 iskaa doshi vahi paryaavaran he jisase ladane ke liye dilli main od evan phir se launch ho rahaa he
 Well, one cannot control overeating, but obesity is not due to the national decline of willpower
 isliye bhi hota he ki paryaavaran badal gaya he
 After this research, obese people can eat very hard that they are getting fat due to environmental reasons, not because of themselves

 His party is also with Nitish now
 agar is tarah netaa apni party kaa vilay karne lage to rashtriya partiyon kaa akelaapan bad jayega
 Think who will go to the BJP and Congress alliance
 jo bhi he ajit singh kaa raajnneetik album dekhnaa ho to time lekar unke paas jaaiyegaa
 In 1998, he formed the Rashtriya Lok Dal
 18 saal party chalaane ke baad, kai dalon va netaaon ke saath rahane ke baad ajit singh ab apni party chalaane kii zimmedaari nitish kumaar ko saunp rahe hai

 Many people here have said that if you want to live in India, then Bharat Mata ki Jai will have to be spoken

 There people have started talking about turning their bus and boat towards India
 europe ke sharnaarthiyon ne jab se suna he ki bharat main rahane ke liye bharat mata kii jai bolnaa hoga ve kaaphi utsahit nazar aa rahe hai
 Millions of people from Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, Albania, Nigeria, Iran and Ukraine are applying to become refugees in Europe
 inamen se sabase zyada log germany main rahanaa chaahate hai
 Over four and a half million people have applied to live in Germany
 agar inhen pataa chal gaya ki bharat se koi ye ofer kar rahaa he ki sirf bharat mata kii jai kehane se bharat main rahane kaa mauka mil saktaa he to sharnaarthi apni naaven bharat kii taraf mode sakate hai
 India can also open Bharat Mata Ki Jai counter instead of visa counter in embassies
 jo bhi sharnaarthi is counter par aakar bharat mata kii jai bolegaa use bharat jane kaa visa diya ja saktaa he
 This would be the easiest rule to grant visas worldwide
 parinde pareshaan hai
 At the election rally in Assam, the BJP president said that if our government comes, even Parinda from Bangladesh will not be able to kill her

 The councils felt that there was no talk of Parinda free India
 sunate hi dephence colony ke fliover par parinde sar jhukaa kar khamosh ho gaye
 They started thinking about where they got caught in the political quarrel of humans
 kisi ko koi rasta nahin sujh rahaa tha
 So, in this only one Udyan Ratna Awardee, Chinde Parinde found a solution
 chuun chuun parinde ne kaha ki ye hamaare udne ke adhikaar par hamalaa he
 What will we do if we do not kill Parinde? ye akaash kiske liye he

 Meanwhile, the Kohinoor diamond has come under nationalism
 kohinoor par bharat ke log or news agencia daawa karti rahi hai lekin supreme court kii ek tippanee se bhartiya rashtrawaad kaa kohinoor paksh sankat main pad saktaa he
 a petition has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking to bring Kohinoor to India

 Nevertheless the solicitor general has been asked for opinion
 ab aisa hira kyon maang rahe hai jis par kai deshon kaa daawa he
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, famous for not speaking, has advised the current Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is famous for speaking
 kaha he ki bolne se zyaada mahatv karne kaa hota he
 Manmohan Singh has said to give this advice to Modi ji, this is news
 2014 ke chunaav se pehle modi ji manmohan singh se kaha karte the ki kuch kiya bhi he to bolaa bhi kiijie
 When Modi ji kept silent on some issues in the middle, the Congress leaders started remembering Manmohan Singh and started calling Modi ji as Silent Modi
 samaj hi nahin aayaa ki ve modi ji kii aalochana kar rahe hai yaa apane purv pradhanmantri kii
 Modi ji would have been confused because of saying silent Modi, so he did not speak on many issues
 is bich vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha he ki jinke naam panama papers main aae hai unki raaton kii neend ud jaaegi
 My advice to such people is to read the Indian Express early in the morning in which Panama is printing something on the papers every day and sleep in the day itself so that there is no problem if you do not sleep at night
 ab badhate hai agali khabar par
 India will laugh, India will grow
 shuukravaar ke hamaare is naare ko aap start ap india, stand ap india se na joden
 Our aim is to reduce the bitterness about political debates
 har baat ko tathyon ke paimaane par na parakhen
 You know that two people have run away
 ek to videsh bhaag gaye hai or ek desh main he magar pataa nahin chal rahaa he
 If you have seen a Modi government minister YS Chaudhary at a bus stand, then immediately inform the Telangana police
 choudhary sahab ko adaalat ne teen teen saman bheje lekin ve haazir nahin ho sake
 He is the Minister of State for Science and Technology in the Union Cabinet
 meraa apana hasya anumaan he ki ve kisi science lab main chhipe ho sakate hai
 a bank in Mauritius has complained against him that Chaudhary Ji is not paying his loan
 saim tu saim bhartiya bainkon ne shikaayat kii he ki maalya sahab unka lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Is it not that both of them have disappeared under the exchange program
 choudhary ji ke khilaaf gair jamaanti warrant jari hua he
 They have also not been removed from the cabinet because they do not know whether they can get this part in the greed of the minister
 mantri ji ne adaalat se kaha he ki unhen dilli main kuch zaruri kaam he isliye court nahin aa paa rahe hai
 i have full faith in the Minister's statement because he has spoken about the honor of the judiciary
 isliye bharosa he kyonki vaai es choudhary par sirf 106 karod kii dendaree he wo bhi duusare mulk ke bank kii
 Mallya sir has run away with 9000 crores, think how much the heart of banks will be beating
 is ghabrahat main bainkon ne maalya ke prastaav ko thukraa diya he
 Mallya had said that he could give Rs 4000 crore by September
 bainko ne kaha lenge to puraa paisa lenge
 Think Mauritius bank is reaching Hyderabad and getting warrant issued against loan defaulters, our banks are expecting Mallya to send money of India to India while abroad
 iaiti ke chaatro ke liye mahangi fees dena aasaan ho gaya he
 Listen carefully
 general chaatro kii fees 90,000 se badhaakar do lakh kar di gai he
 But there is no problem in giving two lakhs to the students, so the students of IIT will get loan without interest
 aane vaale samay main baaki sansthaanon ke chaatr bhi is laajawab suvidha kii maang kar sakate hai
 If the interest will be waived by adding the money that will be of interest, then they will not even know that the fees have increased
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay ko badhai deni chahie ki teen guna fees badhaane ke prastaav ko naamanzoor kar diya he
 The fees have been increased only twice
 baaki chaatro ke liye fees maaf bhi kar di gai he
 Hansega India Badhega India Show is not local

 a big UK government advisor has said that obesity is not a problem of the fat man
 ye samasya us mote aadmi ke kaaran nahin he jiske zyaada khaane se motaa hua he
 There has been a news report in the Telegraph newspaper that there is no fault of obese people that they do not eat less
 iskaa doshi vahi paryaavaran he jisase ladane ke liye dilli main od evan phir se launch ho rahaa he
 Well, one cannot control overeating, but obesity is not due to the national decline of willpower
 isliye bhi hota he ki paryaavaran badal gaya he
 After this research, obese people can eat very hard that they are getting fat due to environmental reasons, not because of themselves
 tippaniyan Since when did India want to teach Pakistan a lesson, but the cricket match could not progress further
 lekin north korea bharat kii tarah sirf baaten nahin karata he
 He is happy to make a fictional video that if dropped a bomb here, look there and drop a bomb there
 is video kaa tital he agar ultimatum kaa jawaab nahin mila to
 We are thankful to North Korea that it has not changed its title mother
 is video main aap dekh sakate hai sabamarine ne washington ke upar missile daag diya he
 The House of the President of South Korea devastates the Blue House
 is tarah se wo apane mulk main in deshon main hamale kaa sapana bech rahaa he
 We are getting ridiculous day by day
 jaise hamaare yahaan bijli jane par chat par sote hue bachche jaisi baaten karte hai thik waisi baaten uttari korea is video main kar rahaa he
 Hit it like this, hit everyone
 vishwa vijeta ban gaae
 You may not have seen such a program of provoking anger at the national level from the video
 shahar ke bacchon ne bhale jangal nahin dekha he lekin aisa nahin ki ve jangal book nahin dekh sakate hai
 The smart city is not yet built, so it is becoming less infamous
 sochiye smart city ke daur main aisa hota to kya hota
 You know that Jungle Book has released a film on Friday
 is film ke siriyal rup ko hamamen se kai log doordarshan par bina maa baap ke gidence ke dekh chuke hai
 In the nineties
 lekin bharat ke ati samvedansheel sensor board ne is film ko you / e certificate diya he
 That is, children under twelve years have to go with the parents to see it
 sensor board ke chairman pehlaaj nihlani kaa kahana he ki is film main thridi effect he
 Sound effects can be scary for young children
 vaise bhi maa baap itane chote bacchon ko akele to cinema haal jane kahaan dete
 But this decision is mocking
 twitor par jo log baarah saal se bade hai wo is faisle par sirius nahin he
 Laughing a lot airport sajaane kii anumati nahin mili hogi isliye ye log band baaja lekar aa gaye
 Welcome the coming
 sardaar vallabh bhai patel airport par koun aane vaala tha jisaki aguwai main itane log aa gaye hai
 Decorated the car in this way
 chaliye ges kiijie
 Waiting for whom a lot of tricolor flag is being waved
 doosraa ges kiijie, kiske intazaar main ye log bharat mata kii jai kaa poster liye khadey hai
 Make a third decision for whom these people have come wearing a new T-shirt
 thik se dekhiye is tishart ko
 a photo of the visitor is also made
 ye aadhaar-tishart nahin he magar photo se pataa chalata he ki gujarat ke ipies adhikari di ji vanjaaraa ahmedabad aa rahe hai
 Vanzara Saheb was in jail in many fake encounters
 kuch saal pehle mumbai kii jail main bhej die gaye
 Came out on bail a few days ago and made his entry grand when he was allowed to go to Gujarat from Mumbai
 vanjaaraa sahab ne kaha he ki unka swaagat sabhi deshbhakton kaa swaagat he
 All patriots should see properly that they have been welcomed
 agar vanjaaraa kii tarah encounter ke aarope main jail jane kaa mauka nahin bhi mila he to bhi is swaagat ko sweekaar to kar hi sakate hai
 Think how welcome it will be when they are acquitted
 yahi nahin jail main rahete rahete vanjaaraa apane sarvice revolver ko bhi kaaphi miss karte honge
 Perhaps that's why when he came out of the Ahmedabad airport, he came to an event and presented a sample of Talwar Dance on stage
 talwaar lekar aise naachte rahe jaise koi yuddh jeet kar aae hon
 India has been a priest of peace but it is not that people have forgotten to use swords
 jab duulhe talwaar lekar shaadi karne ja sakate hai to jail se aane par aap kisi ko talwaar dance karne se kaise roak sakate hai
 You can laugh at this picture because there is no use crying
 ye bharat main bilkul ho saktaa he
 By the way, Banjara saheb seems to be swearing at the sword, even after spending so many years in jail, he has not forgotten his old habits
 ab hamen ye nahin pataa ki bhartiya jelon main kaidiyon ko talwaar bhaanjane kii training di jaati he yaa nahin
 Hats off to him and you to coffee with Karan show, you must have seen
 chaay pe charchaa ke bare main to aapane suna hi hoga
 Did you hear Coffee with Captain? chaay se baat ab coffee par ja pahunchi he
 If Modi ji comes from Assam then he will say that Congress is a party of rich people
 coffee piti he
 Coffee is served
 kahaan se paisa aayaa
 Friends, we cannot drink enough
 hamen chanda dijie
 We are poor people, that's why i used to sell tea
 phir jhagada pahonchega suut ke daam par or maalya ke jahaaz par
 Before this, we get enough with Captain P
 vaise punjab main log jo pinaa pansad karte hai use bihar main bain kar diya gaya he
 But Punjab has captains
 pehle bhi hockey ke captain hue
 Captain of cricket but no coffee with captain
 congress ke netaa he amarinder singh
 i think he was very worried about stealing Prime Minister Modi's style, but Modi has such copyright on selling tea that it is very difficult for a leader to duplicate
 nateeja ye idia aayaa he coffee vid captain
 Prime Minister Modi recently said that he used to sell tea in Assam
 do saal tak chaay kii charchaa hui lekin na to piem ne bataaya na logon ne unase poocha ki aap koun si chaay bechate the
 The PM himself told that he used to sell Assam tea
 ve akele chaay vaale hai jinhen aaj tak yaad he ki bees pachis yaa tees saal pehle ve kis jagah kii chaay bechate the
 If they do not remember, they could have also named Darjeeling Tea but did not take it
 aap jaanate hai ki punjab main coffee nahin hoti he
 Which tea is in Gujarat? coffee hoti he karnataka main
 The Congress Chief Minister of Karnataka will be upset that he is the one who grows coffee and has been the yellow captain
 hamane suna he ki punjab main koi coffee pine vaala nahin mil rahaa he
 It is possible that Captain Saheb may leave on the set of Koffee with Karan until it is found
 karan johar thodaa apaset honge lekin punjab kii kasam dilaa dene se ve set chhod sakate hai
 Then discuss with her a lot from Shilpa to Kareena in front of them
 coffee vid captain hit ho gaya to coffee vid karan kaa kya hoga
 This is not the time to think
 pine kaa time he
 It could also be that Coffee with Karan can also be shown in Congress Village Village
 lokapriy sho rahaa he kya pataa isi se andhere badal chant jaaen yani hat jaaen
 This is the advantage of ruling for sixty years
 tabhi congress kaaphi pilaa rahi he

 My advice to such people is to read the Indian Express early in the morning in which Panama is printing something on the papers every day and sleep in the day itself so that there is no problem if you do not sleep at night

 You know that two people have run away
 ek to videsh bhaag gaye hai or ek desh main he magar pataa nahin chal rahaa he
 If you have seen a Modi government minister YS Chaudhary at a bus stand, then immediately inform the Telangana police
 choudhary sahab ko adaalat ne teen teen saman bheje lekin ve haazir nahin ho sake
 He is the Minister of State for Science and Technology in the Union Cabinet
 meraa apana hasya anumaan he ki ve kisi science lab main chhipe ho sakate hai
 a bank in Mauritius has complained against him that Chaudhary Ji is not paying his loan
 saim tu saim bhartiya bainkon ne shikaayat kii he ki maalya sahab unka lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Is it not that both of them have disappeared under the exchange program
 choudhary ji ke khilaaf gair jamaanti warrant jari hua he
 They have also not been removed from the cabinet because they do not know whether they can get this part in the greed of the minister
 mantri ji ne adaalat se kaha he ki unhen dilli main kuch zaruri kaam he isliye court nahin aa paa rahe hai
 i have full faith in the Minister's statement because he has spoken about the honor of the judiciary
 isliye bharosa he kyonki vaai es choudhary par sirf 106 karod kii dendaree he wo bhi duusare mulk ke bank kii
 Mallya sir has run away with 9000 crores, think how much the heart of banks will be beating
 is ghabrahat main bainkon ne maalya ke prastaav ko thukraa diya he
 Mallya had said that he could give Rs 4000 crore by September
 bainko ne kaha lenge to puraa paisa lenge
 Think Mauritius bank is reaching Hyderabad and getting warrant issued against loan defaulters, our banks are expecting Mallya to send money of India to India while abroad
 iaiti ke chaatro ke liye mahangi fees dena aasaan ho gaya he
 Listen carefully
 general chaatro kii fees 90,000 se badhaakar do lakh kar di gai he
 But there is no problem in giving two lakhs to the students, so the students of IIT will get loan without interest
 aane vaale samay main baaki sansthaanon ke chaatr bhi is laajawab suvidha kii maang kar sakate hai
 If the interest will be waived by adding the money that will be of interest, then they will not even know that the fees have increased
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay ko badhai deni chahie ki teen guna fees badhaane ke prastaav ko naamanzoor kar diya he
 The fees have been increased only twice
 baaki chaatro ke liye fees maaf bhi kar di gai he

 a big UK government advisor has said that obesity is not a problem of the fat man
 ye samasya us mote aadmi ke kaaran nahin he jiske zyaada khaane se motaa hua he
 There has been a news report in the Telegraph newspaper that there is no fault of obese people that they do not eat less
 iskaa doshi vahi paryaavaran he jisase ladane ke liye dilli main od evan phir se launch ho rahaa he
 Well, one cannot control overeating, but obesity is not due to the national decline of willpower
 isliye bhi hota he ki paryaavaran badal gaya he
 After this research, obese people can eat very hard that they are getting fat due to environmental reasons, not because of themselves
 tippaniyan Since when did India want to teach Pakistan a lesson, but the cricket match could not progress further
 lekin north korea bharat kii tarah sirf baaten nahin karata he
 He is happy to make a fictional video that if dropped a bomb here, look there and drop a bomb there

 We are thankful to North Korea that it has not changed its title mother

 The House of the President of South Korea devastates the Blue House

 We are getting ridiculous day by day
 jaise hamaare yahaan bijli jane par chat par sote hue bachche jaisi baaten karte hai thik waisi baaten uttari korea is video main kar rahaa he
 Hit it like this, hit everyone

 You may not have seen such a program of provoking anger at the national level from the video

 You know that Jungle Book has released a film on Friday
 is film ke siriyal rup ko hamamen se kai log doordarshan par bina maa baap ke gidence ke dekh chuke hai
 In the nineties
 lekin bharat ke ati samvedansheel sensor board ne is film ko you / e certificate diya he
 That is, children under twelve years have to go with the parents to see it
 sensor board ke chairman pehlaaj nihlani kaa kahana he ki is film main thridi effect he
 Sound effects can be scary for young children
 vaise bhi maa baap itane chote bacchon ko akele to cinema haal jane kahaan dete
 But this decision is mocking
 twitor par jo log baarah saal se bade hai wo is faisle par sirius nahin he
 Laughing a lot yahi nahin jail main rahete rahete vanjaaraa apane sarvice revolver ko bhi kaaphi miss karte honge
 Perhaps that's why when he came out of the Ahmedabad airport, he came to an event and presented a sample of Talwar Dance on stage
 talwaar lekar aise naachte rahe jaise koi yuddh jeet kar aae hon
 India has been a priest of peace but it is not that people have forgotten to use swords
 jab duulhe talwaar lekar shaadi karne ja sakate hai to jail se aane par aap kisi ko talwaar dance karne se kaise roak sakate hai
 You can laugh at this picture because there is no use crying
 ye bharat main bilkul ho saktaa he
 By the way, Banjara saheb seems to be swearing at the sword, even after spending so many years in jail, he has not forgotten his old habits
 ab hamen ye nahin pataa ki bhartiya jelon main kaidiyon ko talwaar bhaanjane kii training di jaati he yaa nahin
 Hats off to him and you to coffee with Karan show, you must have seen
 chaay pe charchaa ke bare main to aapane suna hi hoga
 Did you hear Coffee with Captain? chaay se baat ab coffee par ja pahunchi he
 If Modi ji comes from Assam then he will say that Congress is a party of rich people
 coffee piti he
 Coffee is served
 kahaan se paisa aayaa
 Friends, we cannot drink enough
 hamen chanda dijie
 We are poor people, that's why i used to sell tea
 phir jhagada pahonchega suut ke daam par or maalya ke jahaaz par
 Before this, we get enough with Captain P
 vaise punjab main log jo pinaa pansad karte hai use bihar main bain kar diya gaya he
 But Punjab has captains
 pehle bhi hockey ke captain hue
 Captain of cricket but no coffee with captain
 congress ke netaa he amarinder singh
 i think he was very worried about stealing Prime Minister Modi's style, but Modi has such copyright on selling tea that it is very difficult for a leader to duplicate
 nateeja ye idia aayaa he coffee vid captain
 Prime Minister Modi recently said that he used to sell tea in Assam
 do saal tak chaay kii charchaa hui lekin na to piem ne bataaya na logon ne unase poocha ki aap koun si chaay bechate the
 The PM himself told that he used to sell Assam tea
 ve akele chaay vaale hai jinhen aaj tak yaad he ki bees pachis yaa tees saal pehle ve kis jagah kii chaay bechate the
 If they do not remember, they could have also named Darjeeling Tea but did not take it
 aap jaanate hai ki punjab main coffee nahin hoti he
 Which tea is in Gujarat? coffee hoti he karnataka main
 The Congress Chief Minister of Karnataka will be upset that he is the one who grows coffee and has been the yellow captain
 hamane suna he ki punjab main koi coffee pine vaala nahin mil rahaa he
 It is possible that Captain Saheb may leave on the set of Koffee with Karan until it is found
 karan johar thodaa apaset honge lekin punjab kii kasam dilaa dene se ve set chhod sakate hai
 Then discuss with her a lot from Shilpa to Kareena in front of them
 coffee vid captain hit ho gaya to coffee vid karan kaa kya hoga
 This is not the time to think
 pine kaa time he
 It could also be that Coffee with Karan can also be shown in Congress Village Village
 lokapriy sho rahaa he kya pataa isi se andhere badal chant jaaen yani hat jaaen
 This is the advantage of ruling for sixty years
 tabhi congress kaaphi pilaa rahi he
 Wait a few days, the BJP will also feed
 vaise bijepi ne ke pi maury ko upi kaa adhyaksh banaaya he
 Maurya saheb writes in his curriculum vitae that he used to sell tea as a child
 un par das aapraadhik mukademe bhi hai
 By the way, you should focus on tea
 chaay bechney se bijepi main kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 i do not know what will happen by selling coffee in Congress
 khabar ai he ki rashtriya lok dal kaa janata dal unitate main vilay hone vaala he
 National Lok Dal leader Ajit Singh is merging with his party after a long time
 abhi tak ve gathbandhan karte the or mantri banakar kisi bhi sarkaar main wilin ho jate the
 My own guess is that if you are bored by merging alone then this time you have made a plan to merge your party
 ajit singh kii kismat bahut kam kii hoti he
 He has an excellent cabinet and portfolio of photographs
 is photo main ve akhilesh yadav kii peeth par haath rakh rahe hai
 In this photo he is with Amar Singh
 is photo main ve rahul gandhi ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Prakash Karat
 is photo main ve rajnath singh ke saath hai
 Baba is with Ramdev in this photo
 is photo main ve mayawati ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Nitish Kumar
 ab ve akele saath nahin he
 His party is also with Nitish now
 agar is tarah netaa apni party kaa vilay karne lage to rashtriya partiyon kaa akelaapan bad jayega
 Think who will go to the BJP and Congress alliance
 jo bhi he ajit singh kaa raajnneetik album dekhnaa ho to time lekar unke paas jaaiyegaa
 In 1998, he formed the Rashtriya Lok Dal
 18 saal party chalaane ke baad, kai dalon va netaaon ke saath rahane ke baad ajit singh ab apni party chalaane kii zimmedaari nitish kumaar ko saunp rahe hai
 National as well as international news
 bharat main ho rahi bharat mata kii jai kii charchaa se antarrashtriya str par logon kii ummiden bad gai he
 Many people here have said that if you want to live in India, then Bharat Mata ki Jai will have to be spoken
 ise sunate hi europe main halchal much rahi he
 There people have started talking about turning their bus and boat towards India
 europe ke sharnaarthiyon ne jab se suna he ki bharat main rahane ke liye bharat mata kii jai bolnaa hoga ve kaaphi utsahit nazar aa rahe hai
 Millions of people from Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, Albania, Nigeria, Iran and Ukraine are applying to become refugees in Europe
 inamen se sabase zyada log germany main rahanaa chaahate hai
 Over four and a half million people have applied to live in Germany
 agar inhen pataa chal gaya ki bharat se koi ye ofer kar rahaa he ki sirf bharat mata kii jai kehane se bharat main rahane kaa mauka mil saktaa he to sharnaarthi apni naaven bharat kii taraf mode sakate hai
 India can also open Bharat Mata Ki Jai counter instead of visa counter in embassies
 jo bhi sharnaarthi is counter par aakar bharat mata kii jai bolegaa use bharat jane kaa visa diya ja saktaa he
 This would be the easiest rule to grant visas worldwide
 parinde pareshaan hai
 At the election rally in Assam, the BJP president said that if our government comes, even Parinda from Bangladesh will not be able to kill her
 ajmal se problem to samaj aata he, magar parindon se kya problem he
 The councils felt that there was no talk of Parinda free India
 sunate hi dephence colony ke fliover par parinde sar jhukaa kar khamosh ho gaye
 They started thinking about where they got caught in the political quarrel of humans
 kisi ko koi rasta nahin sujh rahaa tha
 So, in this only one Udyan Ratna Awardee, Chinde Parinde found a solution
 chuun chuun parinde ne kaha ki ye hamaare udne ke adhikaar par hamalaa he
 What will we do if we do not kill Parinde? ye akaash kiske liye he
 Who is this land for? ham parindon kaa koi mulk nahin hota
 We have a sky
 ham chahen to pakistan jaaen, chahen to bangladesh jaaen or shaam ko lautakar bharat aa jaaen
 Distressed birds kept flying, sometimes returning
 tay hua ki chuun chuun parinda amit shah ke is bayaan ke virodh main apana udan ratna puraskaar waapas karegaa
 In front of the media, birds have also expressed their opposition by flying away
 insaanon se kaha he ki ve parindon ke par ko simaaon main na baandhen
 If humans want to stop then stop
 unke naam par ham parindon ko na roke
 Now Amit Shah is afraid that the Aam Aadmi Party should not support this opposition of the birds
 kahin inhen kumaar vishwaas kavita sunaakar galat raste par na bhatka de
 Maneka Gandhi, a sensitive minister for birds and pets, has not broken her silence
 is bich bharat mata kii jai nahin bolne waalon ko kya sazaa di jaae ise lekar kanfusion ho gaya he
 Be sent out of the country, beheaded or jawed
 pehle do prakaar kii sazaayen to charchaa main aa chuki hai, jai nahin bolne par jabada ukhaadne kaa idia abhi abhi aayaa he
 This news appeared in Friday's Indian Express
 chhattisgarh ke ek mantri hai brijmohan agarwal
 He feels that Baba Ramdev did not like the idea of cutting his neck
 agarwal ne usase thodaa peeche rahete hue kaha ki hamaare kaaryakartaaon ke saamne agar koi rashtravirohi naare lagayegaa to ham unke jabade ko ukhaadne kii takat rakhte hai
 If you have taken birth on the land of India
 hindustan kii dharti kaa ann kha rahe ho or tumhaare marane ke baad bhi tumhen agar do gaz zamin milegi to hindustan kii dharti par milegi isliye bharat mata kii jai bolnaa padegaa
 i had heard of breaking the jaw, the copyright of uprooting seems to be that of Agrawal
 hamane ek dentist se poocha ki jabada kaise ukhada jaataa he
 So he said that in a very serious case, the jaw is broken
 ek dedh ghante kii surgery hoti he
 If BJP workers spend so much time, then they can miss the target of downloading one lakh Namo app in every district
 wo dentist kaa kaam karenge to downlod kab karenge
 Amit Shah has said that every district should have one lakh Namo app downloads
 itani takalif sahakar naa bolne se kya milane vaala he
 It is better not to say no to Jai
 bolne kii maang karne vaale kitne naaraaz ho gaye hai
 Those who say nothing should think
 swami agnivesh ne baba ramdev ke bayaan par indian express main ek lekh likhaa he ki unka sar kaatane vaala bayaan dharm virdohi he
 i became Prof
 Ramdev while reading Agnivesh ji
 agar baba maanavtaa ko pyaar na karte to maanav ke khaane ke liye achaar, biscuit yaa aataa nahin banaate
 His anger is not understood by Agnivesh
 baba ko pataa he ki lakhon sar kaat denge to noodles khaane vaale kam ho jaaenge
 Still they are unable to bear this anger
 ganimat he ki desh main samvidhan he
 He said that there is a law in this country, if not your one, we can cut the neck of millions
 mujhe puraa yakeen he ki baba aisa nahin karenge
 Have said in anger
 swami agnivesh kaa lekh padhakar praayshchit karenge
 Who will harm their flour and noodles by cutting millions of heads
 kuch to he ki baba ko kaala dhan na aane par bhi itnaa gussa nahin aayaa
 No speakers are no less
 nahin bolnaa he to na bolen, baba ke saamne jaakar bolnaa zaruri he ki nahin bolenge
 Khwamkhah why do you want to put your head in the risk zone, brother
 himachal ke mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke kai maamalon kii jaanch chal rahi he
 He has also confused Congress three times by uttering Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 virbhadra singh ne kaha ki main sachcha deshbhakt hum
 i am a nationalist at heart
 bijepi bhi virbhadra singh ke bharat mata kii jai bolne se kanphyus he
 She is unable to understand whether to criticize or to welcome
 virbhadra singh ne kaha he ki ve ab har samaaroh main bharat mata kii jai kaa naaraa lagaayenge
 Meanwhile, the Kohinoor diamond has come under nationalism
 kohinoor par bharat ke log or news agencia daawa karti rahi hai lekin supreme court kii ek tippanee se bhartiya rashtrawaad kaa kohinoor paksh sankat main pad saktaa he
 a petition has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking to bring Kohinoor to India
 yachikaaon ke liye mashhoor subramanyam swami or prashanth bhushan ne ye yachika daayar nahin kii he
 The All India Human Rights and Social Justice Front has filed
 yachikakarta ne british ucchayukta ko bhi party banane kii baat kahi he
 The Supreme Court has said that many countries including South Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh have asserted their right to Kohinoor
 sarkaar ko jo karnaa tha usne kiya he
 Nevertheless the solicitor general has been asked for opinion
 ab aisa hira kyon maang rahe hai jis par kai deshon kaa daawa he
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, famous for not speaking, has advised the current Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is famous for speaking
 kaha he ki bolne se zyaada mahatv karne kaa hota he
 Manmohan Singh has said to give this advice to Modi ji, this is news
 2014 ke chunaav se pehle modi ji manmohan singh se kaha karte the ki kuch kiya bhi he to bolaa bhi kiijie
 When Modi ji kept silent on some issues in the middle, the Congress leaders started remembering Manmohan Singh and started calling Modi ji as Silent Modi
 samaj hi nahin aayaa ki ve modi ji kii aalochana kar rahe hai yaa apane purv pradhanmantri kii
 Modi ji would have been confused because of saying silent Modi, so he did not speak on many issues
 is bich vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha he ki jinke naam panama papers main aae hai unki raaton kii neend ud jaaegi
 My advice to such people is to read the Indian Express early in the morning in which Panama is printing something on the papers every day and sleep in the day itself so that there is no problem if you do not sleep at night

 Who is this land for? ham parindon kaa koi mulk nahin hota
 We have a sky
 ham chahen to pakistan jaaen, chahen to bangladesh jaaen or shaam ko lautakar bharat aa jaaen
 Distressed birds kept flying, sometimes returning
 tay hua ki chuun chuun parinda amit shah ke is bayaan ke virodh main apana udan ratna puraskaar waapas karegaa
 In front of the media, birds have also expressed their opposition by flying away
 insaanon se kaha he ki ve parindon ke par ko simaaon main na baandhen
 If humans want to stop then stop
 unke naam par ham parindon ko na roke
 Now Amit Shah is afraid that the Aam Aadmi Party should not support this opposition of the birds
 kahin inhen kumaar vishwaas kavita sunaakar galat raste par na bhatka de
 Maneka Gandhi, a sensitive minister for birds and pets, has not broken her silence
 is bich bharat mata kii jai nahin bolne waalon ko kya sazaa di jaae ise lekar kanfusion ho gaya he
 Be sent out of the country, beheaded or jawed
 pehle do prakaar kii sazaayen to charchaa main aa chuki hai, jai nahin bolne par jabada ukhaadne kaa idia abhi abhi aayaa he
 This news appeared in Friday's Indian Express
 chhattisgarh ke ek mantri hai brijmohan agarwal
 He feels that Baba Ramdev did not like the idea of cutting his neck
 agarwal ne usase thodaa peeche rahete hue kaha ki hamaare kaaryakartaaon ke saamne agar koi rashtravirohi naare lagayegaa to ham unke jabade ko ukhaadne kii takat rakhte hai
 If you have taken birth on the land of India
 hindustan kii dharti kaa ann kha rahe ho or tumhaare marane ke baad bhi tumhen agar do gaz zamin milegi to hindustan kii dharti par milegi isliye bharat mata kii jai bolnaa padegaa
 i had heard of breaking the jaw, the copyright of uprooting seems to be that of Agrawal
 hamane ek dentist se poocha ki jabada kaise ukhada jaataa he
 So he said that in a very serious case, the jaw is broken
 ek dedh ghante kii surgery hoti he
 If BJP workers spend so much time, then they can miss the target of downloading one lakh Namo app in every district
 wo dentist kaa kaam karenge to downlod kab karenge
 Amit Shah has said that every district should have one lakh Namo app downloads
 itani takalif sahakar naa bolne se kya milane vaala he
 It is better not to say no to Jai
 bolne kii maang karne vaale kitne naaraaz ho gaye hai
 Those who say nothing should think
 swami agnivesh ne baba ramdev ke bayaan par indian express main ek lekh likhaa he ki unka sar kaatane vaala bayaan dharm virdohi he
 i became Prof
 Ramdev while reading Agnivesh ji
 agar baba maanavtaa ko pyaar na karte to maanav ke khaane ke liye achaar, biscuit yaa aataa nahin banaate
 His anger is not understood by Agnivesh
 baba ko pataa he ki lakhon sar kaat denge to noodles khaane vaale kam ho jaaenge
 Still they are unable to bear this anger
 ganimat he ki desh main samvidhan he
 He said that there is a law in this country, if not your one, we can cut the neck of millions
 mujhe puraa yakeen he ki baba aisa nahin karenge
 Have said in anger
 swami agnivesh kaa lekh padhakar praayshchit karenge
 Who will harm their flour and noodles by cutting millions of heads
 kuch to he ki baba ko kaala dhan na aane par bhi itnaa gussa nahin aayaa
 No speakers are no less
 nahin bolnaa he to na bolen, baba ke saamne jaakar bolnaa zaruri he ki nahin bolenge
 Khwamkhah why do you want to put your head in the risk zone, brother
 himachal ke mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke kai maamalon kii jaanch chal rahi he
 He has also confused Congress three times by uttering Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 virbhadra singh ne kaha ki main sachcha deshbhakt hum
 i am a nationalist at heart
 bijepi bhi virbhadra singh ke bharat mata kii jai bolne se kanphyus he
 She is unable to understand whether to criticize or to welcome
 virbhadra singh ne kaha he ki ve ab har samaaroh main bharat mata kii jai kaa naaraa lagaayenge
 Meanwhile, the Kohinoor diamond has come under nationalism
 kohinoor par bharat ke log or news agencia daawa karti rahi hai lekin supreme court kii ek tippanee se bhartiya rashtrawaad kaa kohinoor paksh sankat main pad saktaa he
 a petition has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking to bring Kohinoor to India
 yachikaaon ke liye mashhoor subramanyam swami or prashanth bhushan ne ye yachika daayar nahin kii he
 The All India Human Rights and Social Justice Front has filed
 yachikakarta ne british ucchayukta ko bhi party banane kii baat kahi he
 The Supreme Court has said that many countries including South Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh have asserted their right to Kohinoor
 sarkaar ko jo karnaa tha usne kiya he
 Nevertheless the solicitor general has been asked for opinion
 ab aisa hira kyon maang rahe hai jis par kai deshon kaa daawa he
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, famous for not speaking, has advised the current Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is famous for speaking
 kaha he ki bolne se zyaada mahatv karne kaa hota he
 Manmohan Singh has said to give this advice to Modi ji, this is news
 2014 ke chunaav se pehle modi ji manmohan singh se kaha karte the ki kuch kiya bhi he to bolaa bhi kiijie
 When Modi ji kept silent on some issues in the middle, the Congress leaders started remembering Manmohan Singh and started calling Modi ji as Silent Modi
 samaj hi nahin aayaa ki ve modi ji kii aalochana kar rahe hai yaa apane purv pradhanmantri kii
 Modi ji would have been confused because of saying silent Modi, so he did not speak on many issues
 is bich vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha he ki jinke naam panama papers main aae hai unki raaton kii neend ud jaaegi
 My advice to such people is to read the Indian Express early in the morning in which Panama is printing something on the papers every day and sleep in the day itself so that there is no problem if you do not sleep at night
 ab badhate hai agali khabar par
 India will laugh, India will grow
 shuukravaar ke hamaare is naare ko aap start ap india, stand ap india se na joden
 Our aim is to reduce the bitterness about political debates
 har baat ko tathyon ke paimaane par na parakhen
 You know that two people have run away
 ek to videsh bhaag gaye hai or ek desh main he magar pataa nahin chal rahaa he
 If you have seen a Modi government minister YS Chaudhary at a bus stand, then immediately inform the Telangana police
 choudhary sahab ko adaalat ne teen teen saman bheje lekin ve haazir nahin ho sake
 He is the Minister of State for Science and Technology in the Union Cabinet
 meraa apana hasya anumaan he ki ve kisi science lab main chhipe ho sakate hai
 a bank in Mauritius has complained against him that Chaudhary Ji is not paying his loan
 saim tu saim bhartiya bainkon ne shikaayat kii he ki maalya sahab unka lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Is it not that both of them have disappeared under the exchange program
 choudhary ji ke khilaaf gair jamaanti warrant jari hua he
 They have also not been removed from the cabinet because they do not know whether they can get this part in the greed of the minister
 mantri ji ne adaalat se kaha he ki unhen dilli main kuch zaruri kaam he isliye court nahin aa paa rahe hai
 i have full faith in the Minister's statement because he has spoken about the honor of the judiciary
 isliye bharosa he kyonki vaai es choudhary par sirf 106 karod kii dendaree he wo bhi duusare mulk ke bank kii
 Mallya sir has run away with 9000 crores, think how much the heart of banks will be beating
 is ghabrahat main bainkon ne maalya ke prastaav ko thukraa diya he
 Mallya had said that he could give Rs 4000 crore by September
 bainko ne kaha lenge to puraa paisa lenge
 Think Mauritius bank is reaching Hyderabad and getting warrant issued against loan defaulters, our banks are expecting Mallya to send money of India to India while abroad
 iaiti ke chaatro ke liye mahangi fees dena aasaan ho gaya he
 Listen carefully
 general chaatro kii fees 90,000 se badhaakar do lakh kar di gai he
 But there is no problem in giving two lakhs to the students, so the students of IIT will get loan without interest
 aane vaale samay main baaki sansthaanon ke chaatr bhi is laajawab suvidha kii maang kar sakate hai
 If the interest will be waived by adding the money that will be of interest, then they will not even know that the fees have increased
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay ko badhai deni chahie ki teen guna fees badhaane ke prastaav ko naamanzoor kar diya he
 The fees have been increased only twice
 baaki chaatro ke liye fees maaf bhi kar di gai he
 Hansega India Badhega India Show is not local
 isamen international news bhi he
 a big UK government advisor has said that obesity is not a problem of the fat man
 ye samasya us mote aadmi ke kaaran nahin he jiske zyaada khaane se motaa hua he
 There has been a news report in the Telegraph newspaper that there is no fault of obese people that they do not eat less
 iskaa doshi vahi paryaavaran he jisase ladane ke liye dilli main od evan phir se launch ho rahaa he
 Well, one cannot control overeating, but obesity is not due to the national decline of willpower
 isliye bhi hota he ki paryaavaran badal gaya he
 After this research, obese people can eat very hard that they are getting fat due to environmental reasons, not because of themselves
 tippaniyan Since when did India want to teach Pakistan a lesson, but the cricket match could not progress further
 lekin north korea bharat kii tarah sirf baaten nahin karata he
 He is happy to make a fictional video that if dropped a bomb here, look there and drop a bomb there
 is video kaa tital he agar ultimatum kaa jawaab nahin mila to
 We are thankful to North Korea that it has not changed its title mother
 is video main aap dekh sakate hai sabamarine ne washington ke upar missile daag diya he
 The House of the President of South Korea devastates the Blue House
 is tarah se wo apane mulk main in deshon main hamale kaa sapana bech rahaa he
 We are getting ridiculous day by day
 jaise hamaare yahaan bijli jane par chat par sote hue bachche jaisi baaten karte hai thik waisi baaten uttari korea is video main kar rahaa he
 Hit it like this, hit everyone
 vishwa vijeta ban gaae
 You may not have seen such a program of provoking anger at the national level from the video
 shahar ke bacchon ne bhale jangal nahin dekha he lekin aisa nahin ki ve jangal book nahin dekh sakate hai
 The smart city is not yet built, so it is becoming less infamous
 sochiye smart city ke daur main aisa hota to kya hota
 You know that Jungle Book has released a film on Friday
 is film ke siriyal rup ko hamamen se kai log doordarshan par bina maa baap ke gidence ke dekh chuke hai
 In the nineties
 lekin bharat ke ati samvedansheel sensor board ne is film ko you / e certificate diya he
 That is, children under twelve years have to go with the parents to see it
 sensor board ke chairman pehlaaj nihlani kaa kahana he ki is film main thridi effect he
 Sound effects can be scary for young children
 vaise bhi maa baap itane chote bacchon ko akele to cinema haal jane kahaan dete
 But this decision is mocking
 twitor par jo log baarah saal se bade hai wo is faisle par sirius nahin he
 Laughing a lot saath saal tak raaj karne kaa yah phayda hota he
 Then the Congress is drinking a lot
 thode din ruk jaaiye bijepi bhi pilaaegi
 However, BJP has appointed KP Maurya as the President of UP
 maurya sahab apane biodeta main likhte hai ki ve bachapan main chaay bechate the
 He also has ten criminal prosecutions
 vaise aap chaay par hi dhyaan den
 Anything can happen in BJP by selling tea
 pataa nahin congress main coffee bechney se kya hoga
 The news has come that Rashtriya Lok Dal is going to merge with Janata Dal United
 rashtriya lokdal ke netaa ajit singh bahut jamaane ke baad apni party ke saath vilay kar rahe hai
 Till now they used to combine and would become ministers in any government
 meraa apana anumaan he ki akele vilay karte karte bor ho gaye honge to is baar apni party kaa hi vilay karne kaa plan bana liya he
 Ajit Singh has very little luck
 unke paas mantrimandal or tasveeron kaa portpholio shandaar he
 In this photo, he is putting his hand on the back of Akhilesh Yadav
 is photo main ve amar singh ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Rahul Gandhi
 is photo main ve prakaash karaat ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Rajnath Singh
 is photo main baba ramdev ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Mayawati
 is photo main ve nitish kumaar ke saath hai
 They are no longer alone
 unki party bhi ab nitish ke saath he
 If such leaders start merging their party then the loneliness of the national parties will increase
 sochiye bijepi or congress gathbandhan ke liye kiske paas jaaengi
 Whatever you want to see Ajit Singh's political album, then take the time and visit him
 1998 main unhone rashtriya lok dal banaaya tha
 After 18 years of running the party, after being with many parties and leaders, Ajit Singh is now entrusting the responsibility of running his party to Nitish Kumar
 rashtriya ke saath saath antarrashtriya khabaren bhi
 Due to the discussion of Bharat Mata ki Jai in India, the expectations of people internationally have increased
 yahaan kai logon ne kaha he ki bharat main rahanaa he to bharat mata kii jai bolnaa hoga
 Hearing this, there is a stir in Europe
 vahaan log apni bas or naav mode kar bharat kii taraf chal padane kii baat karne lage hai
 The refugees of Europe have since heard that to stay in India, they have to be very excited
 siria, pakistan, afghanistan, iraq, kosovo, albenia, nigeria, iraan or ukraine se lakhon log europe main sharnaarthi banane ke liye aavedan de rahe hai
 Most of these people want to live in Germany
 saadhe chaar lakh se adhik logon ne germany main rahane kaa aplication diya he
 If they come to know that someone from India is offering that only by saying Bharat Mata ki Jai can get an opportunity to stay in India, then refugees can turn their boats towards India
 bharat bhi duutavaason main visa counter kii jagah bharat mata kii jai counter khol saktaa he
 Any refugee who comes to this counter and utters Bharat Mata ki Jai can be given a visa to visit India
 duniya bhar main visa dene kaa yah sabase aasaan niyam hoga
 Parinde is upset
 assam kii chunavi raily main bijepi adhyaksh ne kah diya ki hamaari sarkaar ai to bangladesh se parinda bhi par nahin maar paaegaa
 Ajmal understands the problem, but what is the problem with the birds
 paridon ko laga ki kahin parinda mukt bharat kii baat to nahin ho rahi he
 Upon hearing the flyover of the Defense Colony, Parinde bowed his head silent
 chintan manan karne lage ki insaanon ke siyaasi jhagade main ve kahaan se funs gaye
 Nobody was thinking of any way
 to inhen main ek udan ratna puraskaar se sammanit chuun chuun parinde ne hal nikaala
 Parinde said that this is an attack on our right to fly
 parinde par nahin maarenge to kya karenge
 Who is this sky for? ye zamin kiske liye hai
 We are no country of birds
 hamaara to akaash hota he
 If we want to go to Pakistan, go to Bangladesh and come back to India in the evening
 pareshaan parinde kabhi udate rahe, kabhi lautate rahe
 It was decided that Parinda will return his Udyan Ratna Award in protest against this statement of Amit Shah
 media ke saamne parindon ne ud ud kar apana virodh bhi jataayaa he
 Humans are told not to tie the boundaries of the borders
 insaanon ko rokna he to roke
 Let us not stop the birds in his name
 ab amit shah ko dar he ki parindon ke is virodh ko aam aadmi party na saport kar de
 Do not divert them on the wrong path by reciting the Kumar Vishwas poem
 parindon or paalatuon ke prati samvedansheel mantri menka gandhi ne apni chuppi nahin todi he
 Meanwhile, there has been confusion over what punishment should be given to those who do not speak Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 desh se baahar bheja jaae, unka sar kaat diya jaae yaa jabada ukhada jaae
 The first two types of punishments have come under discussion, the idea of jaw-breaking has not yet come up
 shuukravaar ke indian express main chhapi he ye khabar
 Brijmohan Aggarwal is a minister of Chhattisgarh
 inhen lagata he ki baba ramdev kaa gardan kaatane vaala idia pasand nahin aayaa
 Aggarwal, following him a bit, said that if someone in front of our workers would raise anti-national slogans, then we have the strength to lift their jaws
 agar hindustan kii dharti par tumne janam liya he
 You are eating food on the land of India and even after you die, if you get two gazes of land, then you will have to say 'bharat Mata ki Jai' on the land of India
 maine jabada todane kii baat to suni thi, ukhaadne kaa copirite agarwal ji kaa lagata he
 We asked a dentist how the jaw is lifted
 to unhone kaha bahut gambhir maamle main hi jabada ukhda jaataa he
 One and a half hour surgery is done
 bijepi ke kaaryakarta itnaa time lagaayenge to har zile main ek lakh namo ap downlod karwaane kaa target miss kar sakate hai
 When they work as a dentist, when will they download? amit shah ne kaha he ki har zile main ek lakh namo ap downlod hona chahie
 What is going to happen by not speaking so much suffering
 isse to acha he ki na bolne vaale jai bol hi den
 How angry those who ask to speak have become
 kuch to naa bolne waalon ko sochna chahie
 Swami Agnivesh has written an article in the Indian Express on Baba Ramdev's statement that his beheading statement is anti-religion
 agnivesh ji ko padhate hue main pro ramdev ho gaya
 If Baba did not love humanity, he would not make pickles, biscuits or flour for human consumption
 unka gussa agnivesh nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 Baba knows that if the millions of heads are cut off, then the noodles eaters will reduce
 phir bhi wo ye gussa bardaasht nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Thankfully, there is a constitution in the country
 unhone kaha ki is desh main kanoon he, nahin to teri ek kii kya, ham to lakhon kii gardan kaat sakate hai
 i am very sure that Baba will not do this
 gusse main kah gaye hai
 Swami will make atonement by reading Agnivesh's article
 lakhon sar kaat kar apane aate or noodles kaa nuksaan koun karegaa
 There is something that Baba did not get so angry even when he did not get black money
 nahin bolne vaale bhi kam nahin hai
 If you do not want to speak, do not speak, it is important to speak in front of Baba or not
 khwamkhah apane sar ko risk zone main kyon daalana chaahate ho bhai
 Several cases of corruption are under investigation against Himachal Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh
 unhone teen baar bharat mata kii jai bol kar congress ko bhi kanphyus kar diya he
 Virbhadra Singh said that i am a true patriot
 dil se rashtravaadi hum
 The BJP is also confused by Virbhadra Singh's Bharat Mata ki Jai
 wo samaj nahin paa rahi he ki aalochana kare yaa swaagat kare
 Virbhadra Singh has said that he will now raise the slogan of Bharat Mata ki Jai at every function
 is bich kohinoor heere ko lekar rashtrawaad sankat main aa gaya he
 The people of India and the news agencies have been claiming Kohinoor, but a Supreme Court comment may put the Kohinoor side of Indian nationalism in jeopardy
 supreme court main kohinoor ko bharat laane kii maang ko lekar yachika daayar kii gai he
 Subramanian Swamy and Prashant Bhushan, famous for the petitions, have not filed this petition
 ol india human ritis and soshal justise front ne daayar kii he
 The petitioner has also spoken of making the British High Commissioner a party
 supreme court ne kaha he ki dakshin africa, pakistan or bangladesh samet kai desh kohinoor par apana haq jataa chuke hai
 It has done what the government had to do
 phir bhi solicitre general se raay maangi gai he
 Why are you asking for a diamond that is claimed by many countries? na bolne ke liye mashhoor purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne bolne ke liye mashhoor maujuuda pradhanmantri narendra modi ko salaah di he
 It is said that there is more importance than speaking
 modi ji ko ye salaah dene ke liye manmohan singh ne bolaa he ye news he
 Before the 2014 elections, Modi used to tell Manmohan Singh that if he has done anything, then also speak
 bich main kuch muddon par jab modi ji chup hue to congressi netaaon ko manmohan singh kii yaad aane lagi he or ve modi ji ko maun modi kehane lage
 Did not understand that he was criticizing Modi ji or his former Prime Minister
 maun modi kehane se modi ji bhi kanphyus ho gaye honge isile unhone kai muddon par bolaa hi nahin
 Meanwhile, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that those whose names have appeared in the Panama Papers will have a sleepless night
 aise logon ko meri salaah he ki subah subah hi indian express pard len jisamen panama papers par rose kuch na kuch chap rahaa he or din main hi so len taaki raaton ko neend na aane par koi pareshaani na ho
 Now let's move to the next news
 hansega india to badhegaa india
 Don't add this slogan of Friday to Start Up India, Stand Up India
 hamaara makasad yahi he ki raajnneetik bahason ko lekar jo katutaa he wo thodi kam ho jaae
 Do not judge everything on the scale of facts
 aap jaanate hai ki do log bhaag gaye hai
 One has fled abroad and is in a country, but it is not known
 modi sarkaar ke ek mantri vaai es choudhary ko aapane kisi bas stand par dekha ho to turant telugana police ko ittela kar den
 The court sent three summons to Chaudhary Saheb but he could not appear
 ve kendriya mantrimandal main vigyaan evam technalji rajya mantri hai
 My own humor is that they might be hidden in a science lab
 marishas ke ek bank ne inke khilaaf shikaayat kii he ki choudhary ji uskaa lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Same to Sem Indian banks have complained that Mallya saheb is not paying their loan
 kahin aisa to nahin ki ye donon exange program ke tahat gaayab ho gaye hai
 a non-bailable warrant has been issued against Chaudhary
 inhen mantrimandal se shaayad isliye bhi nahin hataaya gaya he ki kya pataa mantripad ke laalach main ye bhaag hi na paaen
 The minister has told the court that he has some important work in Delhi, so the courts are unable to come
 mujhe mantri ji kii baat par puraa bharosa he kyonki unhone nyaaypalika ke sammaan kii baat kahi he
 So trust because YS Chaudhary owes only 106 crores to the bank of another country
 maalya sahab to 9000 karod lekar bhaage hai, sochiye bainkon kaa dil kitna dhadkta hoga
 In this panic, banks have turned down Mallya's proposal
 maalya ne kaha tha ki ve sitambar tak 4000 karod rupaya de sakate hai
 Banks said they will take all the money
 sochiye morishas kaa bank hyderabad tak pahunch kar lone difolter ke khilaaf warrant jari karvaa le rahaa he, hamaare bank yaheen se maalya ji se ummid kar rahe hai ki ve videsh main rahete hue bharat kaa paisa bharat bhijwa den
 It has become easier for IIT students to pay expensive fees
 dhyaan se sunen
 The fees of general students have been increased from 90,000 to two lakhs
 lekin chaatro ko do lakh dene main dikkat na aae isliye iaiti ke chaatro ko bina byaaj ke karj milegaa
 In the coming time, students of other institutions can also demand this wonderful facility
 jo paisa byaaj kaa lagegaa use fees main jodakar byaaj maaf kar diya jaae to unhen pataa bhi nahin chalegaa ki fees badi he
 The Ministry of Human Resources should congratulate that it has rejected the proposal to increase the fees threefold
 sirf do guna fees badhaai gai he
 Fees for the remaining students have also been waived
 hansega india badhegaa india sho local nahin he
 It also has international news
 britain kii sarkaar ke ek bade salaahkaar ne kaha he ki motopa mote aadmi kii samasya nahin he
 This problem is not due to the fat man who has become obese by eating too much
 telegraph akhbaar main khabar chhapi he ki isamen mote logon kii koi galati nahin he ki ve kam nahin kha pate hai
 The culprit for this is the same environment that Odd Even is relaunching in Delhi to fight
 thik he ki koi zyaada khaane par control nahin kar paata he lekin motopa ichhashakti ke rashtriya patan ke kaaran nahin hota he
 This also happens because the environment has changed
 is research ke baad mote log jam kar kha sakate hai ki ve apni vajah se nahin, paryaavaran ke kaarnon se mote ho rahe hai
 The comments bharat kab se pakistan ko sabak sikhaana chahta he lekin cricket match se aage baat nahin bad paati he
 But North Korea does not just talk like India
 wo kaalpanik video banaakar khush hota rahata he ki yahaan bam giraaya to vahaan dekho vahaan bam giraaya
 The title of this video is if the ultimatum is not answered
 ham north korea ke shukraguzaar hai ki usne iskaa tital maa kasam badla luungaa nahin rakhaa he
 In this video you can see Submarine has fired missile over Washington
 dakshin korea ke raashtrapati ke makaan blue house ko tabah kar detaa he
 In this way, he is selling the dream of attack in these countries in his country
 ham dinon din haasyaaspad hote ja rahe hai
 Just like we talk like a child sleeping on the roof when we go to power here, exactly the same thing North Korea is doing in this video
 ise maaraa aise maaraa sabko maaraa
 Singing to become a world winner video se rashtriya str par bhadaas nikaalane kaa aisa kaarykram aapane puri duniya main na dekha hoga
 The children of the city may not have seen the jungle but it is not that they cannot see the jungle book
 abhi to smart city nahin bana he isliye kam badanaami ho rahi he
 Think what would have happened in this era of smart city
 aap jaanate hai ki shuukravaar ko ek film reelij hui he jangal book
 Many of us have seen the serial form of this film on Doordarshan without any parental guidance
 nabbe ke dashak main
 But the highly sensitive Censor Board of India has given the film a u / a certificate
 yani baarah saal se kam ke bacchon ko ise dekhne ke liye maa baap ke saath janaa hoga
 Pahlaj Nihalani, chairman of the censor board, says that the film has a 3D effect
 sound effect chote bacchon ke liye daraavna ho saktaa he
 Anyway, where would the parents let such young children go alone to the cinema hall
 magar is faisle kaa mazaaq ud rahaa he
 Those on Twitter who are older than twelve years are not serious on this decision
 kaaphi hans rahe hai
 Till now they used to combine and would become ministers in any government
 meraa apana anumaan he ki akele vilay karte karte bor ho gaye honge to is baar apni party kaa hi vilay karne kaa plan bana liya he
 Ajit Singh has very little luck
 unke paas mantrimandal or tasveeron kaa portpholio shandaar he
 In this photo, he is putting his hand on the back of Akhilesh Yadav
 is photo main ve amar singh ke saath hai
 In this photo he is with Rahul Gandhi

 parinde par nahin maarenge to kya karenge
 Who is this sky for? ye zamin kiske liye hai
 We are no country of birds
 hamaara to akaash hota he
 If we want to go to Pakistan, go to Bangladesh and come back to India in the evening
 pareshaan parinde kabhi udate rahe, kabhi lautate rahe
 It was decided that Parinda will return his Udyan Ratna Award in protest against this statement of Amit Shah
 media ke saamne parindon ne ud ud kar apana virodh bhi jataayaa he
 Humans are told not to tie the boundaries of the borders
 insaanon ko rokna he to roke
 Let us not stop the birds in his name
 ab amit shah ko dar he ki parindon ke is virodh ko aam aadmi party na saport kar de
 Do not divert them on the wrong path by reciting the Kumar Vishwas poem
 parindon or paalatuon ke prati samvedansheel mantri menka gandhi ne apni chuppi nahin todi he
 Meanwhile, there has been confusion over what punishment should be given to those who do not speak Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 desh se baahar bheja jaae, unka sar kaat diya jaae yaa jabada ukhada jaae
 The first two types of punishments have come under discussion, the idea of jaw-breaking has not yet come up
 shuukravaar ke indian express main chhapi he ye khabar
 Brijmohan Aggarwal is a minister of Chhattisgarh
 inhen lagata he ki baba ramdev kaa gardan kaatane vaala idia pasand nahin aayaa
 Aggarwal, following him a bit, said that if someone in front of our workers would raise anti-national slogans, then we have the strength to lift their jaws
 agar hindustan kii dharti par tumne janam liya he
 You are eating food on the land of India and even after you die, if you get two gazes of land, then you will have to say 'bharat Mata ki Jai' on the land of India
 maine jabada todane kii baat to suni thi, ukhaadne kaa copirite agarwal ji kaa lagata he
 We asked a dentist how the jaw is lifted
 to unhone kaha bahut gambhir maamle main hi jabada ukhda jaataa he
 One and a half hour surgery is done
 bijepi ke kaaryakarta itnaa time lagaayenge to har zile main ek lakh namo ap downlod karwaane kaa target miss kar sakate hai
 When they work as a dentist, when will they download? amit shah ne kaha he ki har zile main ek lakh namo ap downlod hona chahie
 What is going to happen by not speaking so much suffering
 isse to acha he ki na bolne vaale jai bol hi den
 How angry those who ask to speak have become
 kuch to naa bolne waalon ko sochna chahie
 Swami Agnivesh has written an article in the Indian Express on Baba Ramdev's statement that his beheading statement is anti-religion
 agnivesh ji ko padhate hue main pro ramdev ho gaya
 If Baba did not love humanity, he would not make pickles, biscuits or flour for human consumption
 unka gussa agnivesh nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 Baba knows that if the millions of heads are cut off, then the noodles eaters will reduce
 phir bhi wo ye gussa bardaasht nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Thankfully, there is a constitution in the country
 unhone kaha ki is desh main kanoon he, nahin to teri ek kii kya, ham to lakhon kii gardan kaat sakate hai
 i am very sure that Baba will not do this
 gusse main kah gaye hai
 Swami will make atonement by reading Agnivesh's article
 lakhon sar kaat kar apane aate or noodles kaa nuksaan koun karegaa
 There is something that Baba did not get so angry even when he did not get black money
 nahin bolne vaale bhi kam nahin hai
 If you do not want to speak, do not speak, it is important to speak in front of Baba or not
 khwamkhah apane sar ko risk zone main kyon daalana chaahate ho bhai
 Several cases of corruption are under investigation against Himachal Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh
 unhone teen baar bharat mata kii jai bol kar congress ko bhi kanphyus kar diya he
 Virbhadra Singh said that i am a true patriot
 dil se rashtravaadi hum
 The BJP is also confused by Virbhadra Singh's Bharat Mata ki Jai
 wo samaj nahin paa rahi he ki aalochana kare yaa swaagat kare
 Virbhadra Singh has said that he will now raise the slogan of Bharat Mata ki Jai at every function
 is bich kohinoor heere ko lekar rashtrawaad sankat main aa gaya he
 The people of India and the news agencies have been claiming Kohinoor, but a Supreme Court comment may put the Kohinoor side of Indian nationalism in jeopardy
 supreme court main kohinoor ko bharat laane kii maang ko lekar yachika daayar kii gai he
 Subramanian Swamy and Prashant Bhushan, famous for the petitions, have not filed this petition
 ol india human ritis and soshal justise front ne daayar kii he
 The petitioner has also spoken of making the British High Commissioner a party
 supreme court ne kaha he ki dakshin africa, pakistan or bangladesh samet kai desh kohinoor par apana haq jataa chuke hai
 It has done what the government had to do
 phir bhi solicitre general se raay maangi gai he
 Why are you asking for a diamond that is claimed by many countries? na bolne ke liye mashhoor purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne bolne ke liye mashhoor maujuuda pradhanmantri narendra modi ko salaah di he
 It is said that there is more importance than speaking
 modi ji ko ye salaah dene ke liye manmohan singh ne bolaa he ye news he
 Before the 2014 elections, Modi used to tell Manmohan Singh that if he has done anything, then also speak
 bich main kuch muddon par jab modi ji chup hue to congressi netaaon ko manmohan singh kii yaad aane lagi he or ve modi ji ko maun modi kehane lage
 Did not understand that he was criticizing Modi ji or his former Prime Minister
 maun modi kehane se modi ji bhi kanphyus ho gaye honge isile unhone kai muddon par bolaa hi nahin
 Meanwhile, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that those whose names have appeared in the Panama Papers will have a sleepless night
 aise logon ko meri salaah he ki subah subah hi indian express pard len jisamen panama papers par rose kuch na kuch chap rahaa he or din main hi so len taaki raaton ko neend na aane par koi pareshaani na ho
 Now let's move to the next news
 hansega india to badhegaa india
 Don't add this slogan of Friday to Start Up India, Stand Up India
 hamaara makasad yahi he ki raajnneetik bahason ko lekar jo katutaa he wo thodi kam ho jaae
 Do not judge everything on the scale of facts
 aap jaanate hai ki do log bhaag gaye hai
 One has fled abroad and is in a country, but it is not known
 modi sarkaar ke ek mantri vaai es choudhary ko aapane kisi bas stand par dekha ho to turant telugana police ko ittela kar den
 The court sent three summons to Chaudhary Saheb but he could not appear
 ve kendriya mantrimandal main vigyaan evam technalji rajya mantri hai
 My own humor is that they might be hidden in a science lab
 marishas ke ek bank ne inke khilaaf shikaayat kii he ki choudhary ji uskaa lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Same to Sem Indian banks have complained that Mallya saheb is not paying their loan
 kahin aisa to nahin ki ye donon exange program ke tahat gaayab ho gaye hai
 a non-bailable warrant has been issued against Chaudhary
 inhen mantrimandal se shaayad isliye bhi nahin hataaya gaya he ki kya pataa mantripad ke laalach main ye bhaag hi na paaen
 The minister has told the court that he has some important work in Delhi, so the courts are unable to come
 mujhe mantri ji kii baat par puraa bharosa he kyonki unhone nyaaypalika ke sammaan kii baat kahi he
 So trust because YS Chaudhary owes only 106 crores to the bank of another country
 maalya sahab to 9000 karod lekar bhaage hai, sochiye bainkon kaa dil kitna dhadkta hoga
 In this panic, banks have turned down Mallya's proposal
 maalya ne kaha tha ki ve sitambar tak 4000 karod rupaya de sakate hai
 Banks said they will take all the money
 sochiye morishas kaa bank hyderabad tak pahunch kar lone difolter ke khilaaf warrant jari karvaa le rahaa he, hamaare bank yaheen se maalya ji se ummid kar rahe hai ki ve videsh main rahete hue bharat kaa paisa bharat bhijwa den
 It has become easier for IIT students to pay expensive fees
 dhyaan se sunen
 The fees of general students have been increased from 90,000 to two lakhs
 lekin chaatro ko do lakh dene main dikkat na aae isliye iaiti ke chaatro ko bina byaaj ke karj milegaa
 In the coming time, students of other institutions can also demand this wonderful facility
 jo paisa byaaj kaa lagegaa use fees main jodakar byaaj maaf kar diya jaae to unhen pataa bhi nahin chalegaa ki fees badi he
 The Ministry of Human Resources should congratulate that it has rejected the proposal to increase the fees threefold
 sirf do guna fees badhaai gai he
 Fees for the remaining students have also been waived
 hansega india badhegaa india sho local nahin he
 It also has international news
 britain kii sarkaar ke ek bade salaahkaar ne kaha he ki motopa mote aadmi kii samasya nahin he
 This problem is not due to the fat man who has become obese by eating too much
 telegraph akhbaar main khabar chhapi he ki isamen mote logon kii koi galati nahin he ki ve kam nahin kha pate hai
 The culprit for this is the same environment that Odd Even is relaunching in Delhi to fight
 thik he ki koi zyaada khaane par control nahin kar paata he lekin motopa ichhashakti ke rashtriya patan ke kaaran nahin hota he
 This also happens because the environment has changed
 is research ke baad mote log jam kar kha sakate hai ki ve apni vajah se nahin, paryaavaran ke kaarnon se mote ho rahe hai
 The comments bharat kab se pakistan ko sabak sikhaana chahta he lekin cricket match se aage baat nahin bad paati he
 But North Korea does not just talk like India
 wo kaalpanik video banaakar khush hota rahata he ki yahaan bam giraaya to vahaan dekho vahaan bam giraaya
 The title of this video is if the ultimatum is not answered
 ham north korea ke shukraguzaar hai ki usne iskaa tital maa kasam badla luungaa nahin rakhaa he
 In this video you can see Submarine has fired missile over Washington
 dakshin korea ke raashtrapati ke makaan blue house ko tabah kar detaa he
 In this way, he is selling the dream of attack in these countries in his country
 ham dinon din haasyaaspad hote ja rahe hai
 Just like we talk like a child sleeping on the roof when we go to power here, exactly the same thing North Korea is doing in this video
 ise maaraa aise maaraa sabko maaraa
 Singing to become a world winner video se rashtriya str par bhadaas nikaalane kaa aisa kaarykram aapane puri duniya main na dekha hoga
 The children of the city may not have seen the jungle but it is not that they cannot see the jungle book
 abhi to smart city nahin bana he isliye kam badanaami ho rahi he
 Think what would have happened in this era of smart city
 aap jaanate hai ki shuukravaar ko ek film reelij hui he jangal book
 Many of us have seen the serial form of this film on Doordarshan without any parental guidance
 nabbe ke dashak main
 But the highly sensitive Censor Board of India has given the film a u / a certificate
 yani baarah saal se kam ke bacchon ko ise dekhne ke liye maa baap ke saath janaa hoga
 Pahlaj Nihalani, chairman of the censor board, says that the film has a 3D effect
 sound effect chote bacchon ke liye daraavna ho saktaa he
 Anyway, where would the parents let such young children go alone to the cinema hall
 magar is faisle kaa mazaaq ud rahaa he
 Those on Twitter who are older than twelve years are not serious on this decision
 kaaphi hans rahe hai
 National as well as international news
 bharat main ho rahi bharat mata kii jai kii charchaa se antarrashtriya str par logon kii ummiden bad gai he
 Many people here have said that if you want to live in India, then Bharat Mata ki Jai will have to be spoken
 ise sunate hi europe main halchal much rahi he
 There people have started talking about turning their bus and boat towards India
 europe ke sharnaarthiyon ne jab se suna he ki bharat main rahane ke liye bharat mata kii jai bolnaa hoga ve kaaphi utsahit nazar aa rahe hai
 Millions of people from Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, Albania, Nigeria, Iran and Ukraine are applying to become refugees in Europe
 inamen se sabase zyada log germany main rahanaa chaahate hai
 Over four and a half million people have applied to live in Germany
 agar inhen pataa chal gaya ki bharat se koi ye ofer kar rahaa he ki sirf bharat mata kii jai kehane se bharat main rahane kaa mauka mil saktaa he to sharnaarthi apni naaven bharat kii taraf mode sakate hai
 India can also open Bharat Mata Ki Jai counter instead of visa counter in embassies
 jo bhi sharnaarthi is counter par aakar bharat mata kii jai bolegaa use bharat jane kaa visa diya ja saktaa he
 This would be the easiest rule to grant visas worldwide
 parinde pareshaan hai
 At the election rally in Assam, the BJP president said that if our government comes, even Parinda from Bangladesh will not be able to kill her
 ajmal se problem to samaj aata he, magar parindon se kya problem he
 The councils felt that there was no talk of Parinda free India
 sunate hi dephence colony ke fliover par parinde sar jhukaa kar khamosh ho gaye
 They started thinking about where they got caught in the political quarrel of humans
 kisi ko koi rasta nahin sujh rahaa tha
 So, in this only one Udyan Ratna Awardee, Chinde Parinde found a solution
 chuun chuun parinde ne kaha ki ye hamaare udne ke adhikaar par hamalaa he
 What will we do if we do not kill Parinde? ye akaash kiske liye he
 Who is this land for? ham parindon kaa koi mulk nahin hota
 We have a sky
 ham chahen to pakistan jaaen, chahen to bangladesh jaaen or shaam ko lautakar bharat aa jaaen
 Distressed birds kept flying, sometimes returning
 tay hua ki chuun chuun parinda amit shah ke is bayaan ke virodh main apana udan ratna puraskaar waapas karegaa
 In front of the media, birds have also expressed their opposition by flying away
 insaanon se kaha he ki ve parindon ke par ko simaaon main na baandhen
 If humans want to stop then stop
 unke naam par ham parindon ko na roke
 Now Amit Shah is afraid that the Aam Aadmi Party should not support this opposition of the birds
 kahin inhen kumaar vishwaas kavita sunaakar galat raste par na bhatka de
 Maneka Gandhi, a sensitive minister for birds and pets, has not broken her silence
 is bich bharat mata kii jai nahin bolne waalon ko kya sazaa di jaae ise lekar kanfusion ho gaya he
 Be sent out of the country, beheaded or jawed
 pehle do prakaar kii sazaayen to charchaa main aa chuki hai, jai nahin bolne par jabada ukhaadne kaa idia abhi abhi aayaa he
 This news appeared in Friday's Indian Express
 chhattisgarh ke ek mantri hai brijmohan agarwal
 He feels that Baba Ramdev did not like the idea of cutting his neck
 agarwal ne usase thodaa peeche rahete hue kaha ki hamaare kaaryakartaaon ke saamne agar koi rashtravirohi naare lagayegaa to ham unke jabade ko ukhaadne kii takat rakhte hai
 If you have taken birth on the land of India
 hindustan kii dharti kaa ann kha rahe ho or tumhaare marane ke baad bhi tumhen agar do gaz zamin milegi to hindustan kii dharti par milegi isliye bharat mata kii jai bolnaa padegaa
 i had heard of breaking the jaw, the copyright of uprooting seems to be that of Agrawal
 hamane ek dentist se poocha ki jabada kaise ukhada jaataa he
 So he said that in a very serious case, the jaw is broken
 ek dedh ghante kii surgery hoti he
 If BJP workers spend so much time, then they can miss the target of downloading one lakh Namo app in every district
 wo dentist kaa kaam karenge to downlod kab karenge
 Amit Shah has said that every district should have one lakh Namo app downloads
 itani takalif sahakar naa bolne se kya milane vaala he
 It is better not to say no to Jai
 bolne kii maang karne vaale kitne naaraaz ho gaye hai
 Those who say nothing should think
 swami agnivesh ne baba ramdev ke bayaan par indian express main ek lekh likhaa he ki unka sar kaatane vaala bayaan dharm virdohi he
 i became Prof
 Ramdev while reading Agnivesh ji
 agar baba maanavtaa ko pyaar na karte to maanav ke khaane ke liye achaar, biscuit yaa aataa nahin banaate
 His anger is not understood by Agnivesh
 baba ko pataa he ki lakhon sar kaat denge to noodles khaane vaale kam ho jaaenge
 Still they are unable to bear this anger
 ganimat he ki desh main samvidhan he
 He said that there is a law in this country, if not your one, we can cut the neck of millions
 mujhe puraa yakeen he ki baba aisa nahin karenge
 Have said in anger
 swami agnivesh kaa lekh padhakar praayshchit karenge
 Who will harm their flour and noodles by cutting millions of heads
 kuch to he ki baba ko kaala dhan na aane par bhi itnaa gussa nahin aayaa
 No speakers are no less
 nahin bolnaa he to na bolen, baba ke saamne jaakar bolnaa zaruri he ki nahin bolenge
 Khwamkhah why do you want to put your head in the risk zone, brother
 himachal ke mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke kai maamalon kii jaanch chal rahi he
 He has also confused Congress three times by uttering Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 virbhadra singh ne kaha ki main sachcha deshbhakt hum
 i am a nationalist at heart
 bijepi bhi virbhadra singh ke bharat mata kii jai bolne se kanphyus he
 She is unable to understand whether to criticize or to welcome
 virbhadra singh ne kaha he ki ve ab har samaaroh main bharat mata kii jai kaa naaraa lagaayenge
 Meanwhile, the Kohinoor diamond has come under nationalism
 kohinoor par bharat ke log or news agencia daawa karti rahi hai lekin supreme court kii ek tippanee se bhartiya rashtrawaad kaa kohinoor paksh sankat main pad saktaa he
 a petition has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking to bring Kohinoor to India
 yachikaaon ke liye mashhoor subramanyam swami or prashanth bhushan ne ye yachika daayar nahin kii he
 The All India Human Rights and Social Justice Front has filed
 yachikakarta ne british ucchayukta ko bhi party banane kii baat kahi he
 The Supreme Court has said that many countries including South Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh have asserted their right to Kohinoor
 sarkaar ko jo karnaa tha usne kiya he
 Nevertheless the solicitor general has been asked for opinion
 ab aisa hira kyon maang rahe hai jis par kai deshon kaa daawa he
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, famous for not speaking, has advised the current Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is famous for speaking
 kaha he ki bolne se zyaada mahatv karne kaa hota he
 Manmohan Singh has said to give this advice to Modi ji, this is news
 2014 ke chunaav se pehle modi ji manmohan singh se kaha karte the ki kuch kiya bhi he to bolaa bhi kiijie
 When Modi ji kept silent on some issues in the middle, the Congress leaders started remembering Manmohan Singh and started calling Modi ji as Silent Modi
 samaj hi nahin aayaa ki ve modi ji kii aalochana kar rahe hai yaa apane purv pradhanmantri kii
 Modi ji would have been confused because of saying silent Modi, so he did not speak on many issues
 is bich vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha he ki jinke naam panama papers main aae hai unki raaton kii neend ud jaaegi
 My advice to such people is to read the Indian Express early in the morning in which Panama is printing something on the papers every day and sleep in the day itself so that there is no problem if you do not sleep at night
 ab badhate hai agali khabar par
 India will laugh, India will grow
 shuukravaar ke hamaare is naare ko aap start ap india, stand ap india se na joden
 Our aim is to reduce the bitterness about political debates
 har baat ko tathyon ke paimaane par na parakhen
 You know that two people have run away
 ek to videsh bhaag gaye hai or ek desh main he magar pataa nahin chal rahaa he
 If you have seen a Modi government minister YS Chaudhary at a bus stand, then immediately inform the Telangana police
 choudhary sahab ko adaalat ne teen teen saman bheje lekin ve haazir nahin ho sake
 He is the Minister of State for Science and Technology in the Union Cabinet
 meraa apana hasya anumaan he ki ve kisi science lab main chhipe ho sakate hai
 a bank in Mauritius has complained against him that Chaudhary Ji is not paying his loan
 saim tu saim bhartiya bainkon ne shikaayat kii he ki maalya sahab unka lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Is it not that both of them have disappeared under the exchange program
 choudhary ji ke khilaaf gair jamaanti warrant jari hua he
 They have also not been removed from the cabinet because they do not know whether they can get this part in the greed of the minister
 mantri ji ne adaalat se kaha he ki unhen dilli main kuch zaruri kaam he isliye court nahin aa paa rahe hai
 i have full faith in the Minister's statement because he has spoken about the honor of the judiciary
 isliye bharosa he kyonki vaai es choudhary par sirf 106 karod kii dendaree he wo bhi duusare mulk ke bank kii
 Mallya sir has run away with 9000 crores, think how much the heart of banks will be beating
 is ghabrahat main bainkon ne maalya ke prastaav ko thukraa diya he
 Mallya had said that he could give Rs 4000 crore by September
 bainko ne kaha lenge to puraa paisa lenge
 Think Mauritius bank is reaching Hyderabad and getting warrant issued against loan defaulters, our banks are expecting Mallya to send money of India to India while abroad
 iaiti ke chaatro ke liye mahangi fees dena aasaan ho gaya he
 Listen carefully
 general chaatro kii fees 90,000 se badhaakar do lakh kar di gai he
 But there is no problem in giving two lakhs to the students, so the students of IIT will get loan without interest
 aane vaale samay main baaki sansthaanon ke chaatr bhi is laajawab suvidha kii maang kar sakate hai
 If the interest will be waived by adding the money that will be of interest, then they will not even know that the fees have increased
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay ko badhai deni chahie ki teen guna fees badhaane ke prastaav ko naamanzoor kar diya he
 The fees have been increased only twice
 baaki chaatro ke liye fees maaf bhi kar di gai he
 Hansega India Badhega India Show is not local
 isamen international news bhi he
 a big UK government advisor has said that obesity is not a problem of the fat man
 ye samasya us mote aadmi ke kaaran nahin he jiske zyaada khaane se motaa hua he
 There has been a news report in the Telegraph newspaper that there is no fault of obese people that they do not eat less
 iskaa doshi vahi paryaavaran he jisase ladane ke liye dilli main od evan phir se launch ho rahaa he
 Well, one cannot control overeating, but obesity is not due to the national decline of willpower
 isliye bhi hota he ki paryaavaran badal gaya he
 After this research, obese people can eat very hard that they are getting fat due to environmental reasons, not because of themselves
 tippaniyan Since when did India want to teach Pakistan a lesson, but the cricket match could not progress further
 lekin north korea bharat kii tarah sirf baaten nahin karata he
 He is happy to make a fictional video that if dropped a bomb here, look there and drop a bomb there
 is video kaa tital he agar ultimatum kaa jawaab nahin mila to
 We are thankful to North Korea that it has not changed its title mother
 is video main aap dekh sakate hai sabamarine ne washington ke upar missile daag diya he
 The House of the President of South Korea devastates the Blue House
 is tarah se wo apane mulk main in deshon main hamale kaa sapana bech rahaa he
 We are getting ridiculous day by day
 jaise hamaare yahaan bijli jane par chat par sote hue bachche jaisi baaten karte hai thik waisi baaten uttari korea is video main kar rahaa he
 Hit it like this, hit everyone
 vishwa vijeta ban gaae
 You may not have seen such a program of provoking anger at the national level from the video
 shahar ke bacchon ne bhale jangal nahin dekha he lekin aisa nahin ki ve jangal book nahin dekh sakate hai
 The smart city is not yet built, so it is becoming less infamous
 sochiye smart city ke daur main aisa hota to kya hota
 You know that Jungle Book has released a film on Friday
 is film ke siriyal rup ko hamamen se kai log doordarshan par bina maa baap ke gidence ke dekh chuke hai
 In the nineties
 lekin bharat ke ati samvedansheel sensor board ne is film ko you / e certificate diya he
 That is, children under twelve years have to go with the parents to see it
 sensor board ke chairman pehlaaj nihlani kaa kahana he ki is film main thridi effect he
 Sound effects can be scary for young children
 vaise bhi maa baap itane chote bacchon ko akele to cinema haal jane kahaan dete
 But this decision is mocking
 twitor par jo log baarah saal se bade hai wo is faisle par sirius nahin he
 Laughing a lot europe ke sharnaarthiyon ne jab se suna he ki bharat main rahane ke liye bharat mata kii jai bolnaa hoga ve kaaphi utsahit nazar aa rahe hai
 Millions of people from Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, Albania, Nigeria, Iran and Ukraine are applying to become refugees in Europe

 At the election rally in Assam, the BJP president said that if our government comes, even Parinda from Bangladesh will not be able to kill her
 ajmal se problem to samaj aata he, magar parindon se kya problem he

 In front of the media, birds have also expressed their opposition by flying away

 If humans want to stop then stop

 Now Amit Shah is afraid that the Aam Aadmi Party should not support this opposition of the birds

 When Modi ji kept silent on some issues in the middle, the Congress leaders started remembering Manmohan Singh and started calling Modi ji as Silent Modi

 Thankfully, there is a constitution in the country

 ab aisa hira kyon maang rahe hai jis par kai deshon kaa daawa he
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, famous for not speaking, has advised the current Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is famous for speaking
 kaha he ki bolne se zyaada mahatv karne kaa hota he
 Manmohan Singh has said to give this advice to Modi ji, this is news
 2014 ke chunaav se pehle modi ji manmohan singh se kaha karte the ki kuch kiya bhi he to bolaa bhi kiijie
 When Modi ji kept silent on some issues in the middle, the Congress leaders started remembering Manmohan Singh and started calling Modi ji as Silent Modi
 samaj hi nahin aayaa ki ve modi ji kii aalochana kar rahe hai yaa apane purv pradhanmantri kii
 Modi ji would have been confused because of saying silent Modi, so he did not speak on many issues
 is bich vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha he ki jinke naam panama papers main aae hai unki raaton kii neend ud jaaegi
 My advice to such people is to read the Indian Express early in the morning in which Panama is printing something on the papers every day and sleep in the day itself so that there is no problem if you do not sleep at night

 If you have seen a Modi government minister YS Chaudhary at a bus stand, then immediately inform the Telangana police
 choudhary sahab ko adaalat ne teen teen saman bheje lekin ve haazir nahin ho sake
 He is the Minister of State for Science and Technology in the Union Cabinet
 meraa apana hasya anumaan he ki ve kisi science lab main chhipe ho sakate hai
 a bank in Mauritius has complained against him that Chaudhary Ji is not paying his loan
 saim tu saim bhartiya bainkon ne shikaayat kii he ki maalya sahab unka lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Is it not that both of them have disappeared under the exchange program
 choudhary ji ke khilaaf gair jamaanti warrant jari hua he
 They have also not been removed from the cabinet because they do not know whether they can get this part in the greed of the minister
 mantri ji ne adaalat se kaha he ki unhen dilli main kuch zaruri kaam he isliye court nahin aa paa rahe hai
 i have full faith in the Minister's statement because he has spoken about the honor of the judiciary
 isliye bharosa he kyonki vaai es choudhary par sirf 106 karod kii dendaree he wo bhi duusare mulk ke bank kii
 Mallya sir has run away with 9000 crores, think how much the heart of banks will be beating
 is ghabrahat main bainkon ne maalya ke prastaav ko thukraa diya he
 Mallya had said that he could give Rs 4000 crore by September
 bainko ne kaha lenge to puraa paisa lenge
 Think Mauritius bank is reaching Hyderabad and getting warrant issued against loan defaulters, our banks are expecting Mallya to send money of India to India while abroad
 iaiti ke chaatro ke liye mahangi fees dena aasaan ho gaya he
 Listen carefully
 general chaatro kii fees 90,000 se badhaakar do lakh kar di gai he
 But there is no problem in giving two lakhs to the students, so the students of IIT will get loan without interest
 aane vaale samay main baaki sansthaanon ke chaatr bhi is laajawab suvidha kii maang kar sakate hai
 If the interest will be waived by adding the money that will be of interest, then they will not even know that the fees have increased
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay ko badhai deni chahie ki teen guna fees badhaane ke prastaav ko naamanzoor kar diya he
 The fees have been increased only twice
 baaki chaatro ke liye fees maaf bhi kar di gai he

 aap jaanate hai ki shuukravaar ko ek film reelij hui he jangal book
 Many of us have seen the serial form of this film on Doordarshan without any parental guidance
 nabbe ke dashak main
 But the highly sensitive Censor Board of India has given the film a u / a certificate
 yani baarah saal se kam ke bacchon ko ise dekhne ke liye maa baap ke saath janaa hoga
 Pahlaj Nihalani, chairman of the censor board, says that the film has a 3D effect

 Meanwhile, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that those whose names have appeared in the Panama Papers will have a sleepless night
 aise logon ko meri salaah he ki subah subah hi indian express pard len jisamen panama papers par rose kuch na kuch chap rahaa he or din main hi so len taaki raaton ko neend na aane par koi pareshaani na ho
 Now let's move to the next news
 hansega india to badhegaa india
 Don't add this slogan of Friday to Start Up India, Stand Up India
 hamaara makasad yahi he ki raajnneetik bahason ko lekar jo katutaa he wo thodi kam ho jaae
 Do not judge everything on the scale of facts
 aap jaanate hai ki do log bhaag gaye hai
 One has fled abroad and is in a country, but it is not known
 modi sarkaar ke ek mantri vaai es choudhary ko aapane kisi bas stand par dekha ho to turant telugana police ko ittela kar den
 The court sent three summons to Chaudhary Saheb but he could not appear
 ve kendriya mantrimandal main vigyaan evam technalji rajya mantri hai
 My own humor is that they might be hidden in a science lab
 marishas ke ek bank ne inke khilaaf shikaayat kii he ki choudhary ji uskaa lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Same to Sem Indian banks have complained that Mallya saheb is not paying their loan
 kahin aisa to nahin ki ye donon exange program ke tahat gaayab ho gaye hai
 a non-bailable warrant has been issued against Chaudhary
 inhen mantrimandal se shaayad isliye bhi nahin hataaya gaya he ki kya pataa mantripad ke laalach main ye bhaag hi na paaen
 The minister has told the court that he has some important work in Delhi, so the courts are unable to come
 mujhe mantri ji kii baat par puraa bharosa he kyonki unhone nyaaypalika ke sammaan kii baat kahi he
 So trust because YS Chaudhary owes only 106 crores to the bank of another country
 maalya sahab to 9000 karod lekar bhaage hai, sochiye bainkon kaa dil kitna dhadkta hoga
 In this panic, banks have turned down Mallya's proposal
 maalya ne kaha tha ki ve sitambar tak 4000 karod rupaya de sakate hai
 Banks said they will take all the money
 sochiye morishas kaa bank hyderabad tak pahunch kar lone difolter ke khilaaf warrant jari karvaa le rahaa he, hamaare bank yaheen se maalya ji se ummid kar rahe hai ki ve videsh main rahete hue bharat kaa paisa bharat bhijwa den
 It has become easier for IIT students to pay expensive fees
 dhyaan se sunen
 The fees of general students have been increased from 90,000 to two lakhs
 lekin chaatro ko do lakh dene main dikkat na aae isliye iaiti ke chaatro ko bina byaaj ke karj milegaa
 In the coming time, students of other institutions can also demand this wonderful facility
 jo paisa byaaj kaa lagegaa use fees main jodakar byaaj maaf kar diya jaae to unhen pataa bhi nahin chalegaa ki fees badi he

 If you have seen a Modi government minister YS Chaudhary at a bus stand, then immediately inform the Telangana police
 choudhary sahab ko adaalat ne teen teen saman bheje lekin ve haazir nahin ho sake
 He is the Minister of State for Science and Technology in the Union Cabinet
 meraa apana hasya anumaan he ki ve kisi science lab main chhipe ho sakate hai
 a bank in Mauritius has complained against him that Chaudhary Ji is not paying his loan
 saim tu saim bhartiya bainkon ne shikaayat kii he ki maalya sahab unka lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Is it not that both of them have disappeared under the exchange program
 choudhary ji ke khilaaf gair jamaanti warrant jari hua he
 They have also not been removed from the cabinet because they do not know whether they can get this part in the greed of the minister
 mantri ji ne adaalat se kaha he ki unhen dilli main kuch zaruri kaam he isliye court nahin aa paa rahe hai
 i have full faith in the Minister's statement because he has spoken about the honor of the judiciary
 isliye bharosa he kyonki vaai es choudhary par sirf 106 karod kii dendaree he wo bhi duusare mulk ke bank kii
 Mallya sir has run away with 9000 crores, think how much the heart of banks will be beating
 is ghabrahat main bainkon ne maalya ke prastaav ko thukraa diya he
 Mallya had said that he could give Rs 4000 crore by September
 bainko ne kaha lenge to puraa paisa lenge
 Think Mauritius bank is reaching Hyderabad and getting warrant issued against loan defaulters, our banks are expecting Mallya to send money of India to India while abroad
 iaiti ke chaatro ke liye mahangi fees dena aasaan ho gaya he
 Listen carefully
 general chaatro kii fees 90,000 se badhaakar do lakh kar di gai he
 But there is no problem in giving two lakhs to the students, so the students of IIT will get loan without interest
 aane vaale samay main baaki sansthaanon ke chaatr bhi is laajawab suvidha kii maang kar sakate hai
 If the interest will be waived by adding the money that will be of interest, then they will not even know that the fees have increased
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay ko badhai deni chahie ki teen guna fees badhaane ke prastaav ko naamanzoor kar diya he
 The fees have been increased only twice
 baaki chaatro ke liye fees maaf bhi kar di gai he

 There has been a news report in the Telegraph newspaper that there is no fault of obese people that they do not eat less

 Well, one cannot control overeating, but obesity is not due to the national decline of willpower
 isliye bhi hota he ki paryaavaran badal gaya he
 After this research, obese people can eat very hard that they are getting fat due to environmental reasons, not because of themselves
 tippaniyan Since when did India want to teach Pakistan a lesson, but the cricket match could not progress further

 The Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) on Thursday rejected a three-member committee constituted by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) to decide on the conduct of hockey in the country
 is teen sadasyeey samiti kii baithak guuruuvaar ko hi honi thi lekin iechaef ne iske astitv ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 The IHF contends that the members of this committee were members of the IOA when the IHF was suspended in 2008, so it cannot be assumed that this committee will take a just decision
 iechaef pramukh aarake shetty or salaahkaar capies gil ne bhi is sambandh main vishwa hockey mahasang (ex) ko chetavanee di he
 The IHF says that FIH should not interfere excessively in Indian hockey matters
 iechaef ke purv pramukh gil ne kaha ki teen sadasyeey samiti main shaamil bhartiya kushti mahasang ke purv adhyaksh jies mangher nyyochit faisla nahin kar sakate
 The committee also includes Birendra Prasad Vaish of Weightlifting Federation and SM Bali, General Secretary of Handball Federation
 tippaniyan The IHF said that the FIH should not interfere in Indian hockey and let the two hockey federations operating in the country reach some route through mutual coordination
 gil kii daleel he ki ioe ne iechaef ko isliye nilambit kiya kyonki uskaa apana agenda tha
 Gokal Gill, "ioa's then chief Suresh Kalmadi wanted to become IHF chief
 kalmadi ne hamase kaha hota
 He should have acted like a decent person
 " The meeting of this three-member committee was scheduled to take place on Thursday but the IHF refused to acknowledge its existence
 iechaef kii daleel he ki is samiti ke sadsy us vakt ioe ke sadsy the, jab iechaef ko 2008 main nilambit kiya tha, lihaaja vah yah maanakar nahin chal saktaa ki yah samiti nyyochit faisla karegi
 IHF chief RK Shetty and consultant KPS Gill have also warned the World Hockey Federation (FIH) in this regard
 iechaef kaa kahana he ki ex bhartiya hockey ke maamalon main jarurat se adhik dakhsandaji na kare
 Former IHF chief Gill said GS Mangher, former chairman of the Indian Wrestling Federation, who was part of the three-member committee, cannot take a just decision
 is samiti main bharottolan mahasang ke birendra prasad vaisya or handball mahasang ke mahasachiv esaem bali ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he
 The comments iechaef ne kaha ki ex ko bhartiya hockey ke maamle main dakhal nahin dena chahie or desh main kaam kar rahe do hockey mahasanghon ko aapasi talmail ke jariye kisi raste par pahunchane dena chahie
 Gill argues that the IOA suspended the IHF because it had its own agenda
 bakaul gil, "ioe ke tatkaaleen pramukh suresh kalmadi iechaef pramukh bananaa chaahate the
 Kalmadi would have told us
 unhen sabhy insaan kii tarah bartaav karnaa chahie tha

 If a politician has made the most headlines and questions for the last thirty years, he is Lalu Prasad Yadav
 aap unke kaayal ho sakate hai, unki aalochana yaa ninda kar sakate hai lekin najar andaaj nahin kar sakate
 Putting your hand on the pulse of the public, there will be very few political doctors better than Lalu who recognizes it
 agar lalu prasad apane puraane dost or pratidwandvi ram vilaas paswan ko mausam vaigyanik kehete hai to khud lalu ek aise raajnneetik raahi hai jinhone mausam ke har rang ko dekha he
 If you see the heights of power, then the prison of corruption
 aam aadmi ke maseehaa vaale andaaj ko dekha to vanshavaad ke nae poshak ke rup main siyaasi aalochana ko jhela
 All books expressing all aspects of Lalu's life appeared in the market
 logon ne padhaa lekin abaki baar unki aatmakatha hi aa gai he
 The name of the book is Gopalganj to Raisina- My Political Journey
 lalu kii aatmakatha main kul 13 adhyay hai
 It begins with his childhood spent in poverty and ends with the admiration of his sons, in whose hands he wants to see the reins of Bihar
 lekin in donon kinaaron ke bich lalu prasad kii jindagi ek prabhaavshaalee rajaneta ke banane or bigadane kii kahani he
 This autobiography of Lalu could be a reference book for understanding the first political changes in the country, in which the country saw the greatest threat to democracy in 1975 as Emergency and the first power change in 1977
 haalanki isamen unke apane aagrah hai
 Despite this, Lalu's autobiography is readable because he has been an active activist of the Bihar movement and has also been close to the leader of the entire revolution, Jai Prakash Narayan
 jab indira gandhi kii satta ke virodh main gujarat se bihar tak chaatro main aakrosh sugabugane laga tha to us aakrosh kii ek chinagaari lalu prasad bhi the, jo un dinon patna vishvavidhyalay chaatrasangh ke adhyaksh the
 The entire opposition was united against Indira Gandhi in those days, whether he was the leader of the socialist movement or the political product of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the Jan Sangh and its student front All India Vidyarthi Parishad
 lekin apni kitaab main lalu prasad likhte hai ki us dauraan bhi unka aresas or abivipi se sidhaa virodh tha or unase wo takaraate rahete the
 In the context of their confrontation, Lalu Prasad takes names from bjp's Sushil Kumar Modi to leaders like Ravi Shankar Prasad and does not miss to explain how leaders of Bihar movement like Sushil Modi and Ravi Shankar Prasad wanted to ruin JP by misguiding him
 Was
 lalu ke aaropon kaa jawaab to bijepi ke netaa denge lekin ye baat sahi he ki jepi andolan se bihar main jitne bhi netaa nikle, unamem lalu prasad se zyada karishmai, janaadhar vaala, janata se sidhe judaa, aam logon kii mushkilon ko samajhane vaala or upekshit vanchit tabake kaa mukhar pairokaar koi or nahin hua
 As Lalu writes in his biography, one of the reasons for this is his birth in poverty and plight
 lalu kii jindagi sangharshon kii ek aisi dastaan he jisamen ek charvaahe kaa betaa loktantr kaa bhavishya tay karne vaala banataa he
 It is possible that the idea of opening a shepherd school came to Lalu's mind from his childhood experience which was a unique initiative in itself and was also praised by many international organizations
 lekin lalu ke is dard main haashiye par khadey logon kaa ek dard chhalakta he ki garib bacchon kii behatari kii us pahal ko abhijatya varg samaj nahin paaya
 In a small village of Gopalganj, the battle of a boy called Lalu, becoming Lalu and then reaching the summit of power, the battle of being called Lalu ji with the mouth of aristocratic bureaucrats, has been as thrilling as it has been
 lalu kii aatmakatha kaa pehla hissaa aapako hindustan ke un gaanvon main le jayega jahaan jindagi santaap ke pahalu main sisakati rahati he
 However, the specialty of life is that she seeks compassion and happiness for herself even in pain
 ye kaise hota he, iskaa behtareen chithran lalu prasad ne kiya he
 By the way, a person is as rational in conflicts, after being a facilitator many times, he becomes equally superstitious
 apni satta ko bachaae yaa banaae rakhane ke liye lalu agar kisi tantric kii sharan main jate hai to vahi lalu 20 saal kii umr main puri ke shankaracharya kaa virodh karne sadakon par nikalate hai, jinhone kaha tha ki harijan to janmajaat achhut hote hai
 On the one hand, Shankaracharya's opposition, on the other hand, the impact of Lohia and Jayaprakash's ideas started falling on Lalu Yadav in his student life
 apane sangharshon ko aam aadmi ke sangharshon se jod dene vaale lalu yadav ne mahaj 28 saal kii umr main loksabhaa kaa chunaav jeeta or sansad main pahunche
 Lalu's autobiography may suggest that he only chose the path of struggle, but fewer politicians are able to use the political mind to take the path of that struggle to the stage of success
 karpuri thakur ke nidhan ke baad lalu bihar main samaajawaadee raajnneeti kaa aguva ban gaye
 When he won the Lok Sabha elections in 1989 and reached Parliament, 41-year-old Lalu wanted him to become a minister in the VP government, but did not get a chance
 apni jeevani main lalu likhte hai ki main or nitish kumaar lakadak kurtaa pyjama pahanakar piemo main ghoomte rahete the lekin kisi ne poocha hi nahin
 But with this cleanliness, Lalu was looking at the chair of the Chief Minister of Bihar
 janata dal ne bihar vidhansabha main jeet hasil kii to veepi singh ramsundar das ko mukhyamantri banvaanaa chaahate the jabaki devilal kii pasand lalu prasad yadav the
 Lalu was aware that if he faced Das directly, he would lose
 isliye unhone chandrashekhar se madad maangi
 Chandrasekhar fielded his close Raghunath Jha
 trikoniya mukaable main teen vot se lalu jeet gaye, or us jeet ne bihar kii raajnneeti ko badal diya
 Lalu Prasad, who took over the reins of Bihar on March 10, 1990, had a unique first term
 apane bhai ke chaparasi vaale quarter se inhone kaamkaaj shuru kiya
 Suddenly, if you reach a police station, go to a brick kiln and rescue a Dalit girl from the hands of people of influential caste
 
 
 ye sari baaten naatakeey lag sakati hai lekin jamaane se shoshan ke shikaar logon ke liye lalu ek vardaan kii tarah aae
 When Bihar first saw a Chief Minister waiting for his turn in his lap with a fever-filled son in Patna's hospital, he also saw for the first time that the Patna Club was taken out of the clutches of the aristocrats and reached the reach of the Dalits
 is saamaajik badlaav ne lalu ko bihar kaa vaastavik hero bana diya
 The incidents of Lalu mentioned in his book, he used to make headlines in newspapers while being his chief minister
 lekin lalu prasad kaa daawa he ki tatkaaleen pradhanmantri veepi singh ko mandal ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu karne kaa suzav unka hi tha
 The funny thing is that all the leaders from Sharad Yadav to Ram Vilas Paswan take credit for this and VP Singh used to say that the decision was absolutely his
 vaise mandal ayog kii siforeeshon ke jariye anya pichhadaa varg main aane vaali jatiyon ke liye 27 fisadi aarakshan kaa darwaja khulaa to bihar main iskaa phayda lalu ko hi hua
 Lalu got another big advantage by stopping Advani's chariot journey
 lalu prasad ne iskaa dilachasp kissa apni kitaab main likhaa he
 He says that when he got information about Advani's Ram Rath Yatra, he came to Delhi and met Advani
 adwani se lalu ne kaha ki agar aapaki yatra nikali to main usko roak duungaa
 Normally, Advani, who remained restrained, said, "who has drunk mother's milk, which will stop my journey
" tab lalu ne kaha ki maine maa kaa bhi doodh piyaa he or bhens kaa bhi
 Lalu used both force and intelligence to stop Advani's chariot journey
 vaise us dauraan adwani prakaran ko kareeb se cover kar rahe patrakaron or netaaon kaa kahana he ki is rathyatra ko rokane kaa sara plan lalu sarkaar main jal sansaadhan mantri jagadanand singh kaa tha lekin lalu ne apane us sabase yogya mantri kaa ek baar bhi naam nahin liya he
 Lalu became the champion of Muslims by stopping Advani's chariot and its effect was reflected in the 1991 Lok Sabha elections when the Janata Dal and its allies won 48 of the 54 seats in undivided Bihar
 mujhe yaad he ki tab india today ne lalu par cover story chapa tha or naam diya tha- The Regional Super Star
 After this, a repeat victory in 1995 made Lalu arrogant
 lalu ne ise khud sweekaar kiya he
 If the story of the fodder scam is told in his book, dynasty has postponed the new experiment to democracy
 1997 main chaara ghotaale ke kaaran jab lalu kaa jail janaa nishchit ho gaya tab unhone apni nitant gharelu patni rabari devi ko mukhyamantri banavaa diya
 But in the book, Lalu writes that this decision was made by leaders like his Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, Jagadananda, Raghunath Jha
 haalanki lalu ke haathon se satta kii kaman chhuti to argedy ke liye bhi bihar main apni satta ko banaae rakhana aasaan nahin hua
 Bihar came out of the hands of RJD in 2005 and came only ten years later when the party formed a grand alliance with Nitish Kumar
 lalu ne apni kitaab main nitish kumaar se haath milaane se lekar nitish ke gathbandhan todane tak kaa behad bebaaki se varnan kiya he
 He does not appear to be indecisive anywhere against Nitish Kumar
 2017 main nitish kumaar ne palati maar di or achaanak bijepi ke saath sarkaar bana lee, jiske bare main 2015 ke chunaavon main ghumghumkar kaha tha ki wo mitti main mil jaaenge lekin bijepi se haath nahin milaayenge
 Amidst all this, Lalu in his book revealed the blatant or claimed that within six months of going with BJP, Nitish had sent his close Prashant Kishor to Lalu for a re-alliance but Lalu refused
 haalanki prashanth kishor kaa kahana he ki lalu kaa ye daawa saraasar galat he
 However, Lalu Prasad's autobiography is worth reading
 raajnneeti kaa khel kitna baarik hota he or kitna khatarnaak bhi, isaki kai paraten yah kitaab kholti he
 Its language could and should have been more comfortable and simple because it is the identity of Lalu
 is pustak ke sahalekhak nalin verma hai jinhone hindi or angreji donon bhashaaon main ise likhaa he
 Secondly, there are some factual mistakes such as that Chandrasekhar did not leave the Congress in 1972 but in 1975 he was expelled from the Congress and imprisoned
 vaise hi veepi singh ke liye 'raja nahin fakir he
 
 
 The slogan of 'desh ke taqdeer hai' was chanted before becoming Prime Minister
 lalu ne apane vanshavaad or satti kii jodtod ko loktantr kii aad main dhankane kii koshish bhale kii he lekin ye baat sahi he ki garibon, pichhadon or daliton ko lalu ne swarg bhale nahi diya lekin swar jarur diya he
 And the same voice has today made them at the center of political-social discourse

 For the last four years, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) people have been engaged in the great success of that great Akbar, who was a big character in history
 silebus main vah akbar ab mahaan nahin rahaa
 But what will they do now, when the Akbar 'great' of the Modi cabinet has gone out
 modi mantrimandal ke akbar kii'mahanata'kaa sandarbh yah nahin he ki usne kile banawaye,balki apane aas-paas jatil angrezi kaa aabhamandal taiyaar kiya or phir uske kile main bharose kaa qatl kiya
 Wounded deeply on the body and mind of women journalists
 is akbar kaa pradhanmantri narendra modi kya karenge,hindibhashi hinagranthi ke shikaar akbar kii angrezi par fidaa honge yaa apni sarkaar ke silebus se baahar kar denge
 We, not only Hindi, but also the English people, take a stand on the ornate English of meaninglessness, which only means that the air of scholarship is raised
 akbar kuch nahin,angrezi kaa hauva he
 Such English-speaking villages in India, from Delhi to Delhi, are considered great scholars
 emje akbar patrakarita kii duniya main vah naam he,jisaki main misaal detaa hum
 i always say be Akbar
 pehle patrakarita karo,phir kisi party ke saansad ban jaao,phir us party se nikalakar uske netaa ke khandaan ko chor kaho or phir duusari party main mantri ban jaao
 Whether or not the Mughals' Akbar was great, but Modi's Akbar is indeed 'great'
 sochie,aaj videshmantri sushma swaraj is akbar se kaise nazar milaayengi,videsh mantralay kii mahila adhikari or karmchaaree is akbar ke kamare main kaise jaaengi
 
 
 The emje akbar kii'mahanata'kaa zikr isliye kar rahaa hum ki unhone koi party nahin badali he
 The minister of state has not become a cabinet minister
 aap jaanate hai ki bharat main mahila patrkaar is peshey main apane saath hue yon shoshan kaa anubhav saajha kar rahi hai
 It is being called 'metoo' in English, that is, it has happened to me too, i want to tell

 Rohini Singh did not name anyone, but perhaps he has something in mind that everyone understood that the one who sits on the stool, the small chair next to the throne, that is the Minister of State for External Affairs, is the same
 vahi he vah akbar,jo aaj tak apni 'mahanata'kii aad main chipa tha
 Journalist Priya Ramani also wrote that she had written about her sexual exploitation in Vogue magazine last year and started the story with an incident with MJ Akbar
 priya ne tab emje akbar kaa naam nahin liya tha,lekin2017kii story kaa link share karte hue emje akbar kaa naam likh diya
 Said that the story that begins with this is MJ Akbar
 priya ne likhaa he ki us raat vah bhaagi thim
 Never went to the room alone with her again
 ye vah akbar he,jo modi mantrimandal main videsh mantralay main cameraa lekar baitha he
 By reading the stories of an anonymous female journalist on the Firstpost website, your bowels will come out
 pataa chalegaa ki emje akbar mahilaon ko shikaar banane ke liye system se kaam karata tha,plan banaata tha,unhen majaboor karata tha apane kamare main aane ke liye
 You will not be able to read this story in its entirety
 akbar ne is mahila patrkaar ko jo gaharaa zakhm diya he,vah padhane main jab bhayanak he,to sahane or use smritiyon ke kone main bachaakar rakhane main us mahila patrkaar ko kya-kya nahin jhelana padaa hoga
 Whenever she would see the name of MJ Akbar somewhere, she would see the dark night in her mind, when Akbar called her alone to the room, sent her to take out the snow and then made her dead with his criminal touch
 uske mudate hi akbar ne use jakad liya tha
 She somehow managed to free herself
 sidhiyon par sandals utarkar phenkaa or nange paanv mumbai ke us hotel se bhaagi

 Wow! yahi aarope agar kisi mahila ne rahul gandhi par lagaaya hota,toibhjhfdaphtar kaa darban tak press conference kar rahaa hota,mantri apana kaam chhodkar bayaan de rahe hote
 Ever since the name of MJ Akbar has come, BJP leaders do not remember the press conference itself
 lutian dilli main satta ke galiyaaron main jin patrakaron ne apane nishaan chode hai,unamem ek naam akbar kaa bhi he
 After Modi came to power, it was laughed out that the journalists who looted the power were thrown out
 janata dekh hi nahin saki ki us lutian gut kaa sabase bada naam to bheetar baitha he
 By becoming the Minister of State for External Affairs
 baaki jo ankar the,wo lutian ke nae chatukaar ban gaye
 Lutyens won Delhi

 Akbar is swimming
 quint website or telegraph akhbaar ne akbar par report kii he
 Akbar was the founding editor of the Telegraph
 inhen patrakarita main kai upanaamon se bulaayaa jaataa he
 What institutions did not give this opportunity to Akbar, while everyone knew about its story
 akbar jab modi mantrimandal main gaye,tab bhi inkaa ateet rajanetaaon ke sangyaan main tha
 If Modi and Shah are not aware, it is like declaring ourselves innocent
 phir bhi emje akbar ko mantri banaaya
 Everyone knows Akbar
 unki angrezi se ghabara jate hai,jo kisi kaam kii nahin he
 Akbar, who wrote the book in the pride of Nehru, was overturned by every word of that book
 apni likhaawat ke prati uskaa yah imaan bataata he ki akbar kaa koi imaan nahin he
 It is with power, especially with power that will last 50 years
 modi chaar rajyon ke chunaav jitkar aa jaaenge or kah denge ki janata hamaare saath hai
 Our opponents oppose me
 yah sab bolkar akbar ko bachaa le jaaenge
 But Prime Minister, the public is still with you, answer why Akbar is with you

 MJ Akbar is the name in the world of journalism that i exemplify
 main hameshaa kahata hum ki akbar bano
 First do journalism, then become an MP of a party, then get out of that party and call its leader's family a thief and then become a minister in another party
 mughalon kaa akbar mahaan tha yaa nahin,lekin modi kaa akbar vaaki'mahaan'he
 Think how today External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will look at this Akbar, how will the women officers and employees of the Ministry of External Affairs go to this Akbar's room
 
 
 ? i am referring to MJ Akbar's 'greatness' because he has not changed any party
 rajyamantri se cabinet mantri nahin bane hai
 You know that women journalists in India are sharing their experiences of sexual exploitation in this profession
 ise angrezi main'mitu' (metoo)kaha ja rahaa he,yani mere saath bhi aisa hua he,main bhi bataanaa chaahati hum
 Under this, many women journalists have given proof of what was done in whatsapp chat with the editor-level journalist that they had indecent conversation with them and hurt their self-respect from their body
 akbar kaa paksh nahin aayaa he,intazaar ho rahaa he,intazaar pradhanmantri ke paksh kaa bhi ho rahaa he
 As part of the metoo movement, Hindustan Times political editor Prashant Jha, whose book 'how BJP wins' has been widely discussed, has had to resign
 prashanth jha ke istife se saaf nahin hua ki unhone apana dosha maan liya he or ab jaanch hogi yaa nahin,kyonki iskaa zikr hi nahin he
 In all these contexts, many women journalists have expressed their grief

 In the course of the metoo campaign, journalist Rohini Singh tweeted how it could happen that women journalists are talking about big editors, but are silent about who is currently sitting in the center of power
 rohinee singh ne kisi kaa naam nahin liya,magar shaayad unki kyaati hi kuch aisi he ki sabane samaj liya ki vah jo singhaasana ke bagal main stool,yani choti kursi par baitha he,yani videsh rajyamantri ke pad par baitha he,vahi he
 He is the one who hid his 'greatness' till today

 Priya did not take the name of MJ Akbar then, but wrote the name of MJ Akbar, sharing the link of the 2017 story
 kaha ki yah kahani jisase shuru hoti he,vah emje akbar he
 Priya has written that she had run away that night
 phir kabhi uske saath akele kamare main nahin gayi
 This is the Akbar who is sitting in the Modi cabinet with a room in the Ministry of External Affairs
 firstpostvebasaita par ek anaam mahila patrkaar kii dastaan padhakar aapaki aant baahar aa jaaegi
 It would be known that MJ Akbar worked with the system to hunt women, make plans, force them to come to his room
 aap is kahani ko puraa nahin pard paaenge
 When Akbar has given a deep wound to this woman journalist, what terrible that woman journalist would have had to bear in order to endure and keep it in the corner of memories
 jab bhi vah emje akbar kaa naam kahin dekhati hogi,apane zahan main vah kaali raat dekhati hogi,jab akbar ne kamare main akelaa bulaayaa,use barf nikaalane ke liye bheja or phir apane aapraadhik sparsh se use adhamra kar diya
 As soon as he turned, Akbar held him
 vah kisi tarah khud ko chhudaakar bhaagi
 Took off the sandals on the stairs and ran barefoot from that hotel in Mumbai
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kya ise padhane ke baad emje akbar ko barkhaast karenge

 bataao,tum log kya kar loge
 Huzoor, you don't know the journalists, everyone will clap
 vaah-vaah kahenge
 If a woman had made the same accusation against Rahul Gandhi, the BJP office would have been holding a press conference up to the concierge, the minister would have been giving up his work and giving a statement
 jab se emje akbar kaa naam aayaa he, bjpke netaaon ko press conference hi yaad nahin aa rahaa he
 Akbar also has a name among the journalists who have left their mark in the corridors of power in Lutyens Delhi
 modi ke satta main aane ke baad jhansa diya gaya ki satta kii chatukaarita karne vaale patrakaron ko baahar kar diya gaya
 The public could not see that the biggest name of that Lutyen faction is sitting inside
 videsh rajyamantri banakar
 The remaining anchors became Lutyens' new smoothie
 lutian dilli jeet gai
 He told that the emperor also drowns in its well and pawn drowns and floats on the surface of the water
 akbar tair rahaa he
 The Quint website and the Telegraph newspaper have reported on Akbar
 akbar telegraph ke sansthaapak sampadak the
 They are called by many surnames in journalism
 is akbar ko kis-kis santhaan ne mauka nahin diya,jabaki iske kisse sabko maaloom the
 Even when Akbar went to Modi's cabinet, his past was still in the minds of politicians
 modi or shah ko pataa na ho,yah apane aap ko bholaa ghoshit karne jaisaa he
 Still made MJ Akbar a minister
 akbar ko sab jaanate hai
 They get nervous with English, which is of no use
 jis akbar ne nehru kii shaan main kitaab likhi,vah us kitaab ke ek-ek shabd se palat gaya
 His faith in his handwriting suggests that Akbar has no faith
 vah satta ke saath he,khaskar us satta ke saath,jo50saal tak rahegi
 Modi will win the elections of four states and will say that the people are with us
 hamaare virdohi meraa virodh karte hai
 All these words will save Akbar
 magar pradhanmantri ji,janata to aapke saath ab bhi he,iskaa jawaab dijie ki akbar kyon aapke saath he

 As part of the metoo movement, Hindustan Times political editor Prashant Jha, whose book 'how BJP wins' has been widely discussed, has had to resign
 prashanth jha ke istife se saaf nahin hua ki unhone apana dosha maan liya he or ab jaanch hogi yaa nahin,kyonki iskaa zikr hi nahin he
 In all these contexts, many women journalists have expressed their grief
 unke man or jism par ye daag lambey samay se chale aa rahe the
 i got told if i got a chance
 film abhinayta ruthik roshan ne ek aise nirdeshak ke saath kaam karne se manaa kar diya he,jis par yon shoshan ke aarope hai
 Action is being taken against the Resident Editor of the Times of India
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kya kar rahe hai,janata dekh rahi he
 In the course of the metoo campaign, journalist Rohini Singh tweeted how it could happen that women journalists are talking about big editors, but are silent about who is currently sitting in the center of power
 rohinee singh ne kisi kaa naam nahin liya,magar shaayad unki kyaati hi kuch aisi he ki sabane samaj liya ki vah jo singhaasana ke bagal main stool,yani choti kursi par baitha he,yani videsh rajyamantri ke pad par baitha he,vahi he
 He is the one who hid his 'greatness' till today
 patrkaar priya ramani ne bhi likhaa ki unhone pichley saal'vog'patrika main apane saath hue yon shoshan kaa samaran likhaa tha or kahani kii shuruyaat emje akbar ke saath hui ghatana se kii thi
 Priya did not take the name of MJ Akbar then, but wrote the name of MJ Akbar, sharing the link of the 2017 story
 kaha ki yah kahani jisase shuru hoti he,vah emje akbar he
 Priya has written that she had run away that night
 phir kabhi uske saath akele kamare main nahin gayi
 This is the Akbar who is sitting in the Modi cabinet with a room in the Ministry of External Affairs
 firstpostvebasaita par ek anaam mahila patrkaar kii dastaan padhakar aapaki aant baahar aa jaaegi
 It would be known that MJ Akbar worked with the system to hunt women, make plans, force them to come to his room
 aap is kahani ko puraa nahin pard paaenge
 When Akbar has given a deep wound to this woman journalist, what terrible that woman journalist would have had to bear in order to endure and keep it in the corner of memories
 jab bhi vah emje akbar kaa naam kahin dekhati hogi,apane zahan main vah kaali raat dekhati hogi,jab akbar ne kamare main akelaa bulaayaa,use barf nikaalane ke liye bheja or phir apane aapraadhik sparsh se use adhamra kar diya
 As soon as he turned, Akbar held him
 vah kisi tarah khud ko chhudaakar bhaagi
 Took off the sandals on the stairs and ran barefoot from that hotel in Mumbai
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kya ise padhane ke baad emje akbar ko barkhaast karenge
 
 
 The According to me, i should pay taxes or bring them in front of everyone at BJP headquarters this evening and say that i make this Akbar the Deputy Prime Minister
 bataao,tum log kya kar loge
 Huzoor, you don't know the journalists, everyone will clap
 vaah-vaah kahenge
 If a woman had made the same accusation against Rahul Gandhi, the BJP office would have been holding a press conference up to the concierge, the minister would have been giving up his work and giving a statement
 jab se emje akbar kaa naam aayaa he, bjpke netaaon ko press conference hi yaad nahin aa rahaa he
 Akbar also has a name among the journalists who have left their mark in the corridors of power in Lutyens Delhi

 By reading the stories of an anonymous female journalist on the Firstpost website, your bowels will come out
 pataa chalegaa ki emje akbar mahilaon ko shikaar banane ke liye system se kaam karata tha,plan banaata tha,unhen majaboor karata tha apane kamare main aane ke liye
 You will not be able to read this story in its entirety
 akbar ne is mahila patrkaar ko jo gaharaa zakhm diya he,vah padhane main jab bhayanak he,to sahane or use smritiyon ke kone main bachaakar rakhane main us mahila patrkaar ko kya-kya nahin jhelana padaa hoga
 Whenever she would see the name of MJ Akbar somewhere, she would see the dark night in her mind, when Akbar called her alone to the room, sent her to take out the snow and then made her dead with his criminal touch
 uske mudate hi akbar ne use jakad liya tha
 She somehow managed to free herself
 sidhiyon par sandals utarkar phenkaa or nange paanv mumbai ke us hotel se bhaagi
 Will Prime Minister Narendra Modi sack MJ Akbar after reading this
 
 
 ?mere hisaab se kar dena chahie yaa phir aaj shamksbhjhfmukhyalay main unhen sabake saamne laakar kahana chahie ki main is akbar ko up pradhanmantri banaata hum
 Tell me what you guys will do
 huzur,patrakaron ko jaanate nahin aap,sab tali bajaaenge
 Wow! yahi aarope agar kisi mahila ne rahul gandhi par lagaaya hota,toibhjhfdaphtar kaa darban tak press conference kar rahaa hota,mantri apana kaam chhodkar bayaan de rahe hote
 Ever since the name of MJ Akbar has come, BJP leaders do not remember the press conference itself
 lutian dilli main satta ke galiyaaron main jin patrakaron ne apane nishaan chode hai,unamem ek naam akbar kaa bhi he
 After Modi came to power, it was laughed out that the journalists who looted the power were thrown out
 janata dekh hi nahin saki ki us lutian gut kaa sabase bada naam to bheetar baitha he
 By becoming the Minister of State for External Affairs
 baaki jo ankar the,wo lutian ke nae chatukaar ban gaye
 Lutyens won Delhi

 Akbar is swimming

 Akbar was the founding editor of the Telegraph
 inhen patrakarita main kai upanaamon se bulaayaa jaataa he
 What institutions did not give this opportunity to Akbar, while everyone knew about its story
 akbar jab modi mantrimandal main gaye,tab bhi inkaa ateet rajanetaaon ke sangyaan main tha
 If Modi and Shah are not aware, it is like declaring ourselves innocent
 phir bhi emje akbar ko mantri banaaya
 Everyone knows Akbar
 unki angrezi se ghabara jate hai,jo kisi kaam kii nahin he
 Akbar, who wrote the book in the pride of Nehru, was overturned by every word of that book
 apni likhaawat ke prati uskaa yah imaan bataata he ki akbar kaa koi imaan nahin he
 It is with power, especially with power that will last 50 years
 modi chaar rajyon ke chunaav jitkar aa jaaenge or kah denge ki janata hamaare saath hai
 Our opponents oppose me
 yah sab bolkar akbar ko bachaa le jaaenge

 An analysis of around 200 files and 23,000 documents confirmed that a British Army consultant had visited India between 8 February and 19 February 1984
 unki yah yatra mandir parisar main maujuud sashastr logon ke khilaaf abhiyaan kii rup rekha taiyaar karne kii aakasmik yojana par bhartiya khufia seva ko salaah dene ke liye hui thi, jisamen us sthaan (swarna mandir) kii jamini toh lenaa bhi shaamil tha
 The Hague pointed out that the Cabinet Secretary's report also included an analysis of the current military personnel, according to which the actual campaign in June 1984 was different from the suggestion made by the British military conscript in February
 oparation bluestar ek jamini hamalaa tha
 There was nothing shocking in it

 The minister told mps that the publication of relevant sections of five additional documents has also been included in the report of Cabinet Secretary Jeremy Heywood, which highlighted the period

 One of the prominent leaders who have questioned the top leadership of the party is Vishwajeet p Rane, who was the leader of the opposition in the previous assembly
 rane ko congress kii ore se mukhyamantri ke daavedaaron main se bhi ek bataaya ja rahaa tha
 Rane's target is Congress general secretary and Goa in-charge Digvijay Singh

 On seeking Nitish's support, Lalu said that when his house is on fire, now he is looking for fire engine
 lalu ne yah bhi kaha ki jithan ram maanjhi sarkaar ko rajd ke samarthan ko galat tareeke se liya gaya
 Now the decision on support will be taken after talks with mlas
 unhone kaha, 'samarthan kaa faisla dilli se apane bag main lekar nahin aae hai, patna main vidhayakon se raishumaari ke baad hoga
 Lalu Yadav also claimed that he telephoned Nitish Kumar himself and gave some tips for politics
 lalu kii taaja bayaanbaji se saaf he ki rajd pramukh ek taraf nitish ko unke ahankaar kaa ehsaas dilaa rahe hai to duusari ore apane vidhayakon kaa mood bhaanpane main lage hai, vahiin nitish kumaar kii apil par sakaaratmak bhi dikhnaa chaahate hai
 On June 17, Lalu has called a meeting of the RJD Legislature Party, in which Lalu can decide on Nitish's support but Lalu wants to get the mood of his mlas before the decision
 gauratlab he ki nitish ne rajyasabha chunaav ke liye lalu se samarthan kii apil kii thi
 While Nitish is appealing for support from Lalu, JD-U rebel mlas are also appealing to Lalu not to stand with Nitish
 baagi vidhayakon ke netaa gyanendra singh gyanu ne kaha ki jis nitish kumaar ne lalu yadav ko 17 varshon tak jaleel kiya, unhen jail bhijwane main koi kor kasar nahin chodi, isliye ab wo nitish kii baton main naa aaen
 However, Lalu Yadav is also fearing rebellion in his camp because some mlas openly supported Nitish Kumar at the time of elections and some wanted to strengthen their foundation before joining hands with Nitish Kumar

 is dauraan unhone khud ke mahagathbandhan kaa cheharaa hone kii baat sire se khaarij kar di
 When asked about Rahul Gandhi as the face of the Grand Alliance, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav said that the face of the alliance could be anyone
 saath hi unhone apni daavedaari par kaha ki, 'main gathbandhan kaa cheharaa nahin hum
 There is a lot of work to do now
 'bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate hue tejasvi yadav ne kaha, 'pehle rahul gandhi par log shaq karte the, lekin aaj unase ghabaraae rahete hai
 If they go somewhere, they have to do rallies
 jab wo atal bihari vaajapeyi ko dekhne aspataal pahunche, to bijepi netaaon main bhagdad much gai
 On the question of opposition solidarity, he said that to save the country and the constitution, the opposition has to be mobilized

 The next day of Diwali, preparations for Chhath Puja are started with loud noise
 chhath mahaparv kii gharelu taiyaariyon ke baad baari aati hai, bahari vyavastha kii
 a few weeks before the sixth, the ghats are cleaned
 is safai main nadi yaa talab ke pani kii safai mahatvapurn hoti he, kyonki vrati pani main khadey hokar hi surya ko arghya detii hai
 Cleanliness has special significance in Chhath festival
 aisi manyata he ki chhath mata prakruti kii devi hai or unhen saaf-safai bahut pasand he
 But just like last year in the capital, this time also there are six Ghatjas
 na to ghaaton kii safai kii gai he or naa hi pani saaf karne kaa vaada puraa kiya gaya he
 This time too, there are a lot of dirt on the ghats of Yamuna and the water tank of Yamuna
 yani is baar vrati surya or chhath mata ko nirmal jal se nahin balki kaala pani se arghya dengi
 However, tents are being installed at ISBT Kayamuna Ghat with loud noise
 pani kaa chhidkaav kiya ja rahaa hai, lekin ghat ke kinare pani kii haalat jas kii tas hai
 Efforts are being made to show it cleanly by doing light cleaning, but the truth is that there is nothing except dirt in this water
 chhath puja samiti ke sadsy arun kumaar ne aaj tak ko bataaya ki is baar manish sisodiya, manoj tiwari har kisi se shikaayat kii gai, lekin shikaayat ke baavjood yamuna nadi ke pani kii saaf-safai main koi antar nahin dikh rahaa he
 Let us tell you that the Delhi government had assured that before six months, water will be released from Haryana in the Yamuna, so that the Yamuna becomes clear and some water also gets increased
 lekin aisa nahin hua
 Apart from ISBT, ITO, Wazirabad etc
 is the story of every ghat
 na ghat par safai he, na yamuna main pani he
 Now, in such a situation, the six students will have to make a new festival this time with dirty ghats and black water Yamuna
