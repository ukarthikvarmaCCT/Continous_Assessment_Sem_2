 5GB data 28 dinon kii validity ke saath miltaa tha
 Now the validity of this plan has been increased to 54 days and the limit of data has been increased to 2GB daily
 yani company ne data ko lagbhag dabl kar diya he

 - input bhashaa Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has sought leave from Sonia Gandhi to go out and meditate
 ye chuttee rahul ne tab maangi he jab sansad kaa bajet satr shuru hua he or anna hajaare endie sarkaar ke bhoomi adhigrahan bill ke khilaaf ramlila maidan main dharna par baithe hai
 This is the same issue on which Rahul Gandhi has demonstrated in Bhatta Parsaul in Uttar Pradesh
 bhala rahul ko isi vakt chuttee kii jarurat kyon padi
 Isn't everything right in the Congress, because why did Rahul Gandhi have to ask Sonia for leave? One, he is not studying in any school, nor is Sonia Gandhi a teacher
 congress gandhi kii apni party he, yadi rahul bina maange chuttee par chale jate to bhi koi chuun nahin kar saktaa tha
 Now the biggest question is whether Rahul has gone out on vacation
 kya party main rahul ko utani chhot nahin mil rahi he jaisaa wo chaahate hai? There are some issues on which Rahul falls alone in the party, such as not listening to Rahul in ticket distribution and giving more power to the leaders of the states
 kya congress daftar main baithne vaale sabhi bade netaa unke khilaaf shadyantra karte hai? kya rahul gandhi rajyon main congressi netaaon ke gutbaji se pareshaan hai? har haar ke baad congress daftar ke baahar priyanka lao congress bachaao ke poster se rahul aahat hue hai
 
 
 The ek bade congress ke netaa ne central haul main bataaya ki yadi rahul naaraaz ho kar gaye hai to phir unhone acha kiya he
 The Congress is completely divided on this issue
 ek gut jo rahul ke saath he vah ise aam chintan ke pehle aatm chintan bataa rahaa he
 The other group is enjoying
 yah bhi sahi he ki haal ke dinon main congress ke kai netaa kai kaarnon se party chhod kar gaye, jaise haryana main choudhary virendra, dilli main krishna tirath, tamilnadu main jayanti natarajan aadi
 If some oppose Rahul in a tongue-in-cheek, Chidambaram's sons give a statement in the media
 congress ko apane aap ko phir se sabit karnaa he varanaa logon ke paas aam aadmi party kaa vikalp he
 Now the problem is how Rahul will do all this because it is being said that he is being made the president of Congress in April
 is maukey se pehle rahul kaa aatm chintan par janaa, akele main sochna kis ore ishara karata he? kya wo adhyaksh pad thukraa bhi sakate hai? pataa nahin asli baat rahul hi bataa sakate hai jo chuttee par hai

 The medical bulletin issued by Kaveri Hospital says that Karunanidhi's condition is still critical
 karunanidhi 29 july se intensive care unit (isiu) main bhartee hai or unka ilaaj chal rahaa he
 According to the statement released by the hospital, according to the age of Kikrunanidhiki, all the organs of his body have to struggle hard to function properly

 Their response during treatment will determine the way for further treatment

 Rahul Gandhi is not young

 At this age, his great grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru presided over the historic Lahore session of 1929 and passed the resolution of Swaraj despite the skepticism of his political mentor Mahatma Gandhi

 Rahul Gandhi's strategy was inverted literally and figuratively
 unhone centre se apni ranneeti kaa sanchaalan kiya
 From the comfortable rooms of the ruling bench in Delhi, he turned the chapati into an incomprehensible puzzle
 unke salaahkaaron ne sochaa tha ki har bhugolic kshetra yaa samudaay ko paise, bhram yaa bhavatmak sangrakshan ke jariye manage kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus began a campaign of political deceit

 After 2009, the Congress did everything to isolate its allies
 usne un partiyon ko bhi nacheez samajhakar jhidak diya jinase vah jarurat padane par haath mila sakati thi
 As a result, other parties have carved out a niche for themselves where constituents in the ruling coalition may feel relaxed at times, bored of the Congress
 dramuk sareekhee jo partiyaan gathbandhan se baahar nikalne kaa saahas nahin kar paa rahi hai, ve bali ke bakre kii tarah udasin baithi hui hai
 The Congress has used tax officials to get its allies on the way
 lekin uskaa yah tarika thik nahin he
 Parties who had no choice but to remain silent thought it appropriate to wait for the right opportunity

 In simple political mathematics, the association with the Congress is gradually becoming a burden
 congress ke pravaktaa manish tiwari sareekhe netaa sweekaar karne lage hai ki shaharon main party ke khilaaf baari asantosh he
 Clearly, this is a deviation from UPA 1's policy when the Congress valued the vote bank of one of its allies

 The Congress will not be able to recover from the shock of the Uttar pradesh-punjab earthquake during 2012

 Then why should these leaders of the fighters, allies and the opposition wait for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections? If they put up a common candidate for the presidency, a crisis may arise for the Congress

 Rahul Gandhi blamed the basic structure of the party for the defeat in Uttar Pradesh, but has he looked at the top structure of his party? None of the stalwarts of the Congress is strong enough to revive the party or bring it to a less respectable position in their state
 phir buniyadi str ke kaaryakartaaon ko kyon dosha dena? congress daawa kar sakati he kiusne kendriya cabinet ke ek bhrasht mantri ko jail bhijwa diya, lekin vah goa main apane mukhyamantri ko giraftaar karnaa kyon bhul gai jise matadaataaon ne lambey samay ke liye nirvaasan main bhej diya he

 As a first step towards the coronation of Rahul to the post of Prime Minister, new life was to be burnt in the Congress in Uttar Pradesh
 isi vajah se kai ummidavaaron kii ore se maang kiye jane ke baavjood rahul ko uttar pradesh main mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar ke taur par pesh nahin kiya gaya tha

 Rahul has already taken his war room to Gujarat
 karnataka or himachal pradesh ke saath is rajya main chunaav agle saal kii shuruyaat main hone hai
 BJP is ruled by these three states, but the real contest is in Gujarat
 agar rahul narendra modi se yah rajya chhinane main safal rahete hai, to unhen vah pratishtha kaaphi had tak waapas mil jaaegi, jo unhone uttar pradesh main kho di he
 Considering the dependence of the Congress on the family, in 2014 also the party's star campaigner will remain Rahul
 lekin unhen pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar ke taur par pesh kiya jayega yaa nahin, yah is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki congress in chunaavon or iske baad 2013 ke ant main hone vaale madhya pradesh or rajasthan ke chunaavon main kaisaa pradarshan karti he
 If the same score card is repeated again, it is more likely that Rahul will postpone his chances of becoming the Prime Minister for 2019 and replace him with a Manmohan singh-sonia Gandhi type of system
 is tarah ke chutkule esemes par pehle hi chal pade hai ki uttar pradesh main paraajay se manmohan singh ke rajnatik kaarykaal ko vistaar mil gaya he
 Interestingly, on March 7, when asked who would be the prime ministerial candidate of the Congress in 2014, Sonia Gandhi gave a chilling answer saying that "2012 is going on
" ’congress ke varisht netaa manishankar ayyar ne media se kaha, ‘rahul aasaani se pradhanmantri ke pad par baith sakate the
 Instead they decided to work on the ground and chose the most difficult ground
 ’ ve yaad karte hai ki kaise divangat rajeev gandhi ke netritv main 1983 main congress karnataka or andhra pradesh kaa chunaav haar gai thi
 Despite this, Rajiv's position within the Congress remained unquestioned
 isi prakaar, maujuuda paraajay ke liye kisi ne bhi rahul ko doshi nahin mana
 In contrast, many Congressmen are vying to take all the blame on their heads
 rahul pehle bhi thokar kha chuke hai
 He led the party's disastrous election campaign in Bihar in 2010
 vahaan ve rajya str ke netritv ko abhi tak taiyaar nahin kar sake hai
 But Uttar Pradesh's shock was bigger than Bihar
 yah vah rajya he jise unhone apni karmbhumi banaaya tha
 a General Secretary of the Congress says that he will soon go to Uttar Pradesh again and he is eager to create a line of local leadership
 in mahasachiv ke anusaar rahul teen kendriya mantriyon-arpyen singh, jitin prasad yaa pradeep jain main se kisi ek ko pradesh congress adhyaksh ke taur par pesh karne par vichaar kar rahe hai
 One of the lessons that Rahul has learned from Uttar Pradesh is that a reliable leader is needed in the state to win elections
 rajya ke vartmaan netritv main congress vidhayak dal ke netaa pramod tiwari or pradesh congress cameti kii adhyaksh reeta bahuguna-joshi hai
 Both cannot win elections from anywhere except in their constituency
 congress ke ek sthaneey netaa bataate hai, ‘ritaji jaanati hai ki unke pita (hemavathi nandan bahuguna) ko indiraji ne kis tarah kaat-chhaant kar bouna kar diya tha
 He knows how dangerous it is to be a leader of stature in Congress
 ’is hindibhashi kshetra ke mahaan rakshak kii apni swayambhu bhoomika kaa rahul ne bahut anand liya
 Rahul now knows that there is no benefit from his visits that touch the threshold of the state
 agar congress rajya main vaapasi karnaa chaahati he, to use jarurat he shashakt sthaneey netritv kii
 The politics of the way Rahul appealed - promising a package for one section of Uttar Pradesh, juggling reservation for another and presenting a caste face for a third - the people of the state apparently turned down is
 rahul ke saath samasya yah he ki ve sochate angreji main hai or phir apane vichaaron kaa hindi main anuwaad karte hai
 During the rally in Phulpur on 14 November, the shameful incident of calling the people of Uttar Pradesh a beggar took place for this reason
 lakhanu ke ek congressi safai dete hai, ‘ve vastav main kahana yah chaahate the ki uttar pradesh ko rojgaar ke itane avasar pradaan karaane chahie, jisase yahaan ke logon ko kaam ke liye baahar na janaa pade
 Incidentally, the message that was heard was not this
 samvaad kii isi khai ke kaaran rahul ke bhaashan votaron ke saath bhaavnaatmak judaav kii bajaae akasar pravachan kii tarah lagate hai
 Sonia Gandhi has said that the problem in Uttar Pradesh was that there were 'more leaders than necessary'
 ’ agar rahul party ke netaa ke taur par safal hona chaahate hai, to unhen apane salaahkaaron kii team kaa nae sire se moolyankan karnaa chahie
 After the election, Rahul said in a conversation with the media's chosen people that he wanted him to be projected as the chief ministerial contender, but his party leaders were against it
 rahul ko galat disha main bhatkaae jane kaa mauka dene kii bajaae apane antarman kii baat sunani chahie thi
 Apart from this, Mayawati has made it clear that the reservation politics of the Congress Party has been successful in pushing Muslims into the ranks of the Samajwadi Party

 He had said, 'I will be 70 this year

 Equally worrying is the cover that the Congress leadership has covered

 In front of the media, Sonia Gandhi downplayed the loss saying that we expected more from Punjab
 ’ sonia ne apane girebaan main jhankane kii bajaae manpreet badal kii pipuls party of punjab (pipipi) par dosha madhnaa behatar samajha
 He said, 'PPP has hurt us in 23 seats
 ’ ek had tak ve sahi bhi hai
 Despite Manpreet's best efforts to garner a credible third option, he could only take the anti-incumbency vote beyond the Congress
 lekin uttar pradesh kii tarah punjab main congress ke chunaav prachaar abhiyaan main khot thi
 Unlike the Samajwadi Party and the Akali Dal, the Congress failed to change itself over time
 chandigarh ke institute for deveopment and communication ke nideshak pramod kumaar kehete hai ki akali-bhaajapa gathbandhan kii jeet ‘akali dal ke paramparaagat agenda main achche-khaase badlaav’ ke saath hui he
 The party completely relinquished discriminatory religious slogans, ending its relationship with the politics after Operation Bluestar
 usne loklubhaavan naaron or vikaas ko chunaa
 The Shiromani Akali Dal renewed social engineering and linked urban Hindus with itself
 gauratlab he ki akali dal kii taraf se pehali baar ummidavaar banaae gaye 12 hinduon main se 9 chunaav jeet gaye
 In contrast, Amarinder and his people promised their supporters that the repressive cycle with them would be avenged and also promised that the 'akalis would be taught a lesson
 ’ lekin ve logon ko bhavishya ke punjab kaa apana najariya bataane main asamarth rahe
 The Congress manifesto also could not present any credible and grassroots alternative to Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal's development agenda
 punjab ke saath pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii pahchaan bhi najdiki taur par judi hui he
 The resentment against the UPA was to such an extent that only a few Congress candidates demanded the Prime Minister to campaign in his home state
 sonia sweekaar kar chuki hai ki haar kii ek vajah mahangaai ho sakati he
 Other ministers from the state like Pawan Bansal, Ambika Soni, Ashwini Kumar, and even the Punjabi identity of Kapil Sibal failed to get voters in their favor
 chunaav haarin, ladaai nahinmayawati apana saamaajik aadhaar barkaraar rakhane main safal rahines prasannarajanhaar sari galatchhemiyon ko khatm kar detii he
 The very next day, the results of which threw Mayawati out of the pretense of invincibility and brought her to the ground of bitter reality, she looked more human than her lifeless idols
 jab ve lakhanu main media kaa saamana karne liye pahunchin, to unki chaal main maharaniyon vaala andaaj nahin rah gaya tha
 And when she spoke, her words were no longer a divine command to the g-huzuriya reporters
 unhone vinamrata ke saath sawaalon kaa jawaab diya, balki sawaalon ko saha
 Mayawati did not have this humility until she was the Empress of Awadh
 mayawati ne apane patan kii sateek samiksha kii, bhavukta ko haaavee nahin hone diyah ‘rajyabar main daliton ne basapa ko vot diya he
 Because of this, the BSP is at number two
 aisa na hota, to meri haalat waisi hoti, jaisi bihar main lalu prasad kii hui
 'said absolutely right
 ve uttar pradesh haar gai hai, lekin apana aadhaar unhone kamobesh barkaraar rakhaa he
 The figures prove them right
 samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party ko mili voton main sirf 3
 There is a difference of 3 percent
 haalanki mayawati ko is baar mili 25
 9 percent of the vote, 4 from the votes he received in the 2007 assembly elections
 5 pratishat kam hai
 And, in 2007, he also got the same unilateral victory as Mulayam Singh in 2012
 iske alaava, pichley do loksabhaa chunaavon or haal ke vidhansabha chunaavon main mayawati ke voton main koi khaas utaar-chadhaav nahin hua he; vah 24 se 27 pratishat ke bich hi rahaa he
 Such a social vote, which is not destroyed and is easily transferred, is unique in politics
 lekin akavle dalit, mayawati ko uttar pradesh nahin jita sakate
 And Mayawati should understand this from the height of her victory in 2007 and her speed of going to bed five years later
 or is maamle main bhi mayawati khud hi apni party kii sabase badi vishleshak hai
 He said, "seeing the Congress being weak and seeing the backward and upper castes going towards the BJP, the Muslims voted in bulk to the Samajwadi Party
 70 pratishat musalamaanon ne samaajawaadee party ko vot diya
 'but the mathematics of castes does not tell the whole story
 isse yah spasht nahin hota he ki jo mayawati pichley paanch saal se apane karyaalay kaa harek din 6 march kii taiyaari main bitaa rahi thim, ve gramin garibon ko apane paksh main kyon nahin laa sakin
 This failure only exposes the desires of the underprivileged and the limitations of the only leader of the party built on their empowerment
 uttar pradesh kaa vikaas suchakank kushasit pichde ilaakon kii rati-ratai dhun ko nakaarta he
 Uttar Pradesh took 7 under the rule of Mayawati
 28 pratishat kii vikaas dar darj kii he, jo 8
 Is only slightly lower than the national average of 15 percent
 or yah bhi dekhen ki isse pehle ke 10 varshon main jab bharat kii vikaas dar 7
 4 percent, then Uttar Pradesh averaged 4
 4 pratishat ke niraashajanak str par tha
 The index of happiness did not match the index of happiness and the index of happiness is much more efficient in raising votes
 mayawati khud apane rajasi andaaj ke alaava kisi or ko dosha nahin de saktin
 The more she went into the kothi of 5 Kalidas Marg in Lucknow, the more she went away from the hearts of the voters who had reached her peak in 2007
 saamaajik nyaay ke bhavavesh kii lahar par savaar koi netaa logon kii andekhi nahin kar saktaa
 If you do not believe J
 jayalalita yaa lalu prasad se poochkar dekh lijie
 The only ray of hope in Mayawati's downfall is that Dalits have not completely abandoned her and that Mayawati is still one of India's most powerful leaders
 ab agali ladaai ke liye khud ko taiyaar karne ke liye unke paas puure paanch saal hai
 She can better understand the basic reality even while staying out of power

 usne likhaa he ki bharat main jahaan netaa apane paheraave ko samvaad ke madhyam ke rup main videshiyon se zyada istemaal karnaa jaan gaye hai, modi har drushti se sabase alag hai
 Modi is most different in connecting his personal style to his political platform
 patrika ne likhaa he ki modi kurta soundarya nahin balki mulya kaa ek set he
 It has its charm in it
 neuyork times ne narendra modi main ek aisa netaa dekha he jo vah hai vahi vah pahante hai
 He has written that the image craft of the new Prime Minister of India and his style of fashion can be made a case study

 Another article in Time magazine reported that Modi is being compared to Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Regan, Ariel Sharon, Shinzo Aib and Tang Xiaoping, Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Recip Taip

 Muthuvel Karunanidhi was the biggest name in Tamil Nadu politics
 em
 Karunanidhi was such a Dravidian politician, who is respected in the whole country
 vah paanch baar (1969–71, 1971–76, 1989–91, 1996–2001 or 2006–2011) tamilnadu ke mukhyamantri rah chuke hai
 The DMK chief's biggest strength is his work as a chief minister in the past, a strong worker base in the urban and urban areas of Tamil Nadu and an excellent record of helping the state with Delhi, no matter the government at the center
 par bade siyaasi kadke baavjood karunanidhi kabhi bhi saamaajik kshetra ke buniyadi dhaancha kaaryakramon main diemke ke yogadan ko bhunaa nahin paae
 The reason for this was the allegations of corruption and nepotism kept on the party

 He did not trust anyone else, as a result all his trusted loyal family were people
 diemke ko isaki keemat bhi chukaani padi
 The reason for the dmk's defeat in the 2011 and 2014 Lok Sabha elections was the 2G scam with their second daughter Rajya Sabha MP Kanimozhi at the center

 He told the press conference that an email has come out in the Rafael deal, under which Anil Ambani knew about the Rafale deal before the Foreign Secretary and HAL and what deal was he dealing with the Defense Minister of France? In this way, Rahul has raised five questions
 rafel par rahul ke paanch sava-1
 Rahul Gandhi said that 10 days before the Rafale Deal's mou was signed, how did Anil Ambani know that a deal was being done

 In Bhopal, a man had seven marriages and did not let any girl know that he was already married
 lekin uski saatvin bivi ne use pakad liya or police ko shikaayat di
 The police has registered a case of dowry harassment in this case and is raiding at many places in search of the accused
 aaropee kaa naam shahzad ali bataaya gaya he
 Surprisingly, all the marriages or marriages Ali did were fake
 un shaadiyon ke sartificket aisi sansthaaon se liye gaye the, jinke paas shaadi kaa sartificket dene kaa adhikaar hi nahin he
 Zeenat (name changed), a 23-year-old girl living in farhat-abja, Bhopal, has complained to the police
 usne bataaya ki salbhar pehle shahzad ali ne use dekha or phir uskaa peechha karnaa shuru kar diya
 She was then doing a computer course
 pehle din ali ne usase koi baat nahin kii
 Then on the second and third day too, Ali followed him and propped him up after getting a chance
 jinat ne bataaya, 'ali ne aisi kahani sunai ki uskaa dil jeet liya
 He said that he is from a good house and wants to marry me
 usne dharmik baaten kin or mere parivaar kaa bhi dil jeet liya
 "he had the skills to impress girls," Jeet said, adding that he had great skills to impress girls

 dharmik baaten karata tha
 All the knowledgeable about Ali girls would give them gifts and rotate according to their wishes
 phir shaadi ke liye taiyaar kar letaa tha
 He also used to change his style
 lekin vah kabhi photo nahin khinchvaata tha
 Junk, fond of getting married, said that he got a file after marriage
 ali hameshaa is file ko chhipaakar rakhata tha
 One day when Zeenat saw that file, it had niches with the rest of the girls
 jinat ke bataaya ki uskaa gussa saatven aasmaan par chadh gaya
 When Ali came to know about this, he told everything
 jinat ke anusaar ali ne use bataaya ki vah pehle bhi 6 shaadiyaan kar chukaa he
 Has killed three of 6 girls
 vah shaadi ke baad ladakiyon par paisa laane kaa dabaav daalata or maar-peet karata tha
 Zeenat's mother told that initially she used to talk sweetly, but it ruined her daughter's life
 use faansee kii sajaa honi chahie
 Where did he bring his marriage certificate, after losing his life in the guise of Ali, Zeenat told that through a lawyer, Ali used to prepare the documents of marriage from Anjuman Nikah ul Muslimeen institution
 hindu ladakiyon ko to iske bare main kuch bhi pataa nahin hota tha
 Till date the team asked the Qazi of the city about the nikah and about this institution, then Qazi Mushtaq Ali Nadvi said that no nikahnama is valid other than kaziyat
 police ne ali ke khilaaf abhi tak sirf dahej pratadna kaa maamla darj kiya he or jaanch kar rahi he

 India Today Reveals bmc's Claim in Mumbai's Roads Reality Checks Kereality Checks Is there really not a hole in Mumbai? Was BMC Standing Committee Chairman and Shiv Sena leader Yashwant Jadhav rightly challenged on Monday that "show if there is a single pit in Mumbai
" ’ jadhav ko aise daawey or chunauti ke liye soshal media par bahut kuch sunaaya gaya
 India Today decided to conduct a reality check of Mumbai's roads on Tuesday
 BMC dusron par dosha madhne main der nahin lagaataa, isliye hamane mumbai kii bhitari sadakon kii jamini haqiqat jaanane kii koshish kii
 First know what Jadhav said- "there is not a single pit in Mumbai, show me a single pit
" main har din mumbai kii sadakon par safar karata hum
 i do not see a single pit
 agar kahin aisa he to wo metro nirmaan kii vajah se he
 But let me assure you that there is not a single pit
 ”jab reporter ne kaha ki main abhi aapako das gadde dikhaa saktaa hum, is par jadhav ne kaha, “aap mujhe ek bhi gadhda dikhaao, use do ghante main thik kar diya jayega
 "let us now know what the reality of Mumbai's roads was seen on Tuesday - 1 reality check @ Andheri Kurla Road
 The road looks full of pits
 asal main yahaan gadde itane bade hai ki logon ko unke paas lakdi ke board lagane pade hai jisase ki haadason ko roka ja sake
 Half of the road is such that it cannot be used for traffic
 2 reality check @ chakaala rodyaha hamane chaar crossing signlles par reality check kiya
 Big pits on the four corners of the roads were seen waiting for us
 trephic ke lihaaz se ye bahut ahm kshetra he
 There are many offices and schools here
 is jagah ke liye kai shikaayatein bheji gayi lekin BMC se koi jawaab nahin mila
 3 Reality Check @ CST Road Here also the situation did not look any different
 gaddhon kii vajah se santa cruge chembur link road jaise ahm brij kii taraf baari jam dikhaa
 Surprisingly, an iron rod appeared on the road here
 logon kaa aarope he ki baari barsaat main ye gadde or lohe kii rod nahin dikhti
 This rod penetrated the legs of many people and injured them
 4 reality check @ bandra east sarvice roadchar din pehle 47 varshiya panchamalaal nirmal naam ke auto rickshaw driver kii ek bade gadde ne jaan le lee thi
 Four days later, we decided to go and inspect the spot
 dukh kii baat he ki chaar din baad bhi sthiti waisi hi thi
 There was no difference even after the death of a person
 gaddha ab bhi khulaa tha or uske aasapaas koi bairicading bhi nahin thi
 The result of the reality check was that all the claims made by BMC Standing Committee Chairman Yashwant Jadhav were airborne
 aapako hamane chaar sadakon kii haqiqat dikhaai
 The list is very long
 sawaal ye he ki kab adhikari jaagenge or sahi main gaddhon kii samasya se mumbaikaron ko nijaat dilaayenge? or kab band hoga gaddhon main funs kar logon kii jaan jane kaa silsilaa? Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya said on Saturday that the Left Front government of West Bengal has taken a necessary lesson from the Singur incident and it has been decided for the industry to be very careful before acquiring land

 We have learned a lesson from Singur
 hamane nirnay liya he ki udyog ke liye bhoomi adhigrahan ke purv adhik saavdhaanee barti jaaegi
 "tata Motors changed plans in 2008 to set up a Nano car plant at Singur in Hooghly district in West Bengal following the anti-land acquisition movement led by the Trinamool Congress
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki sarkaar udyog lagane ke liye upjau bhoomi kaa adhigrahan nahin karegi or bhuswamiyon se jameen unki sahmati ke baad lee jaaegi
 Buddhadeb said, "before taking land from the landowners, we will ensure that the land is being acquired on the basis of consent
 hamen aisi sthiti sunishvith karaani he log utsukata ke saath bhoomi den
 "buddhadeb said," The priority of the government will be that the industrialists acquire land at their level in the state and the government will intervene only when a problem arises in the process
 sarkaar us samay bhi hastkshep karegi, jab udyogpati jameen kharidte samay bhuswamiyon ko bazaar dar se kam keemat denge

 It has been more than three months since the people elected their councilors in the capital Delhi, but the councilors are currently distressed and unemployed
 parshad hone ke baad bhi ve na to ilaake main kaam karvaa paa rahe he or na hi logon kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan
 It has a large aspect due to non-formation of zonal committees
 dilli main emsidi ke chunaav khatm hue teen maheene se zyada ho chuke hai or emsidi main bijepi ne baaji maari he, lekin jite hue parshad hi logon kaa kaam karvaa nahi paa rahe hai
 Actually, councilors have to pass the zonal committee to get any new work done in their area, but the zonal committee has not been formed yet
 rajdhani kii teenon nagar nigamon ke parshad aajkal khaase bebas, pareshaan or ‘berozegaar’ hai
 He is now three months old as a councilor, yet he is not able to get any work done in his area

 The solution to these problems is very small, but the problem is that the zonal committees have not been formed in all the zones of the three corporations, so neither they are able to raise these problems nor they can be solved
 darasal parshad jonal cameti kaa adhyaksh hota he or ye cametiyaan vaidhanik hoti he, jisamen jone ke sabhi adhikari sadsy hote hai
 Councilors make old work and new work in their area through these zonal committees
 parshadon ke mutabik ilaake ke adhikari ye kah dete hai ki jab tak jonal cameti koi aadesh nahi paarit karti he, tab tak wo kaam karne main asamarth he, jisaki vajah se parshadon ke saamne nai samasya saamne aa rahi he
 Councilors say that the notification of the formation of zonal committees is issued by the Delhi government, but the government has not yet issued the notification, due to which the committees are not being formed

 america samvidhan main die praavdhaan ke mutabik yadi chunaav ho jane ke baad koi raashtrapati maansik kshamta ganvaa de, apni sarkaar ko kisi gaban yaa daman main jhonk de athwa videshi shaktiyon ke vishwaas ko dhakka pahunchaae to use kursi se hataa dena america ke hit main he
 Now Donald Trump can be charged on almost all of the terms in the US Constitution for the President's impeachment

 His income as President is against the Constitution

 To travel to the library, he has to travel 40 kilometers in Delhi itself
 shaayad vah pehla mauka tha yaa pehla darshak tha jisane librari ke liye hamen patr likhaa tha
 For the past few days, messages were coming from students of Pithoragarh in Uttarakhand that they are agitating about library and books
 aisa kab suna he aapane ki chaatr apane college kii kabad ho chuki librari ko behatar karne ke liye andolan kar rahe hon
 Obviously this should be noticed
 acchhee baat he ki chaatro ne pehle sangharsh kiya
 Struggled for many days so that they could win this battle at the local level
 agar unki manshaa librari ke naam par pratiyogita parikshaon kii taiyaari ke liye reeding room tak simit he to phir koi badi baat nahin he lekin kitabon kii duniya main khoe rahane ke liye ve ek behatar librari maang rahe hai tab phir is hafte kaa yah sabase shandaar jan andolan he
 We must keep struggling every day so that love towards humanity can remain a reality
 main is poster ko kai baar dekh chukaa hum
 If this is the purpose, then there is also a poem in this movement
 jis kisi ne kitabon kii maang ke saath is naare ko gadha he wo apane pithauragarh kaa zyaada bhala kar rahaa he
 Look at this poster
 shikshak pustak leki rahenge
 This slogan is written here in the local language
 hamun kii chau kitaab or masaab
 Teacher Book Movement
 yah poster aapse hi sawaal kar rahaa he
 Not a teacher, not a book, don't you mind
 is kamare main zamin par ek poster he jis par likhaa he dhairya kii pariksha jari he
 For 20 days there has been a movement for teachers in the library and college in Pithoragarh
 bees din se dilli bekhbar he ki bharat main ek aisa andolan bhi ho rahaa he
 Every day 15-20 students were sitting on dharna
 ravivaar ko bhi dharna dete hai
 Pithoragarh district is on the border with India, China and Nepal
 lakshmana singh mahar rajkeey snatakottar mahavidhyalay
 When it became a college in 1963, Agra was part of the university
 70 ke dashak main parvatiy uniwarsity kii maang ko lekar andolan chalaa tha jisamen do noujvaan sajjan laal shah or soban singh nepali police kii goli se maare gaye the
 Then in 1973 separate universities are formed for Kumaon and Garhwal
 pithauragarh kumaun uniwarsity kaa hissaa he
 Shivam, a student there, has sent us a video
 video main poster binar lekar chaatr shahar main maun march nikaal rahe hai
 The city must have been very alert as to what has happened to these young men
 kitaab or shikshak ke liye andolan kar rahe hai
 After all, in which city have you seen the march with the library? shahar ke collejon main librari kii haalat kharaab he magar chaatro ne whatsap uniwarsity ko hi apana bhagya samaj liya
 These students of Pithoragarh have understood that if books are found, their lives will be made
 kam se kam yah ek aisa maamla he jisase samjhauta nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 7000 students study in this college
 chaatro ne bataaya ki darjanon pad khaali hai
 One day in support of 19 days, their mothers also came with the same banner on which the teacher was written
 pustak chahie
 On 8 October 2018, a memorandum was also given to the District Magistrate here so that he would convey the matter of the students to the Minister
 5 baar ziladhikari ke karyaalay ko gyaapan diya gaya he
 Students also visited Nainital
 kisi gyaapan kaa jab jawaab nahin aayaa to chaatr khud hi dharne par baith gaye
 Mothers of students have also marched on the road of Pithoragarh
 apane bacchon ke banaae poster binar lekar unhone unke behatar bhavishya ke liye march kiya
 i wish such a movement would grow in every city
 is maa ke haath main jo poster he use padhie
 There is neither teacher nor books in college, how will my child read
 jo andolan dilli main nahin ho sakaa, patna main nahin ho sakaa, kolkata main nahin ho sakaa, wo pithauragarh main ho rahaa he
 Went to the National Library of Kolkata last year
 vishaal reeding room main pratiyogita pariksha ke liye chaatr baithe nazar aae magar vahaan padi kitabon main bhatakane vaala koi chaatr nahin mila
 There were competition books brought from outside on everyone's table
 usee ke campus main ashutosh mukherjee collection bhi he
 He had a collection of 87,000 books
 itani kitabon ke liye neshnal librari ke campus main alag se librari he
 There are 30 versions of Arabian Nights
 kai bhashaaon kii dictionari he
 His research paper on mathematics was published in Cambridge in 1881
 kanoon kii padhai ke baad ashutosh mukherjee kolkata hoicourt ke jaj bhi bane
 He died in 1924
 shyama prasad mukherjee ke pita the ashutosh mukherjee
 How many readers in India will have more than 87,000 books brought and ordered from all over the world
 aise pathak ke desh main azaad bharat ke noujvaan librari main kitabon ke liye andolan kar rahe hai
 Students say that all the books in the library belong to the last century
 college kii prayogshaala behad karaab haalat main he
 Hence, students started protesting from 17 June
 yah andolan desh ke yuvaaon se bhi kah rahaa he ki ve apni librari main jaaen or dekhen ki nai kitaaben ain hai yaa nahin
 a digital library is written on the wall
 likh diya he taaki kabhi pradhanmantri guzaren to unka didital india dikh jaae
 Students said that a digital library of the name is written
 7000 chaatro ke is college kii librari main jo reeding room he wo 30 se adhik chaatro ke baithne bhar ke liye he
 These books belong to the last century on the library rack
 un kitabon se aage duniya bahut badal gai he
 Now these books filled with dampness do not even get the course that they are taught
 itihaas ho yaa vigyaan kii kitaab ho
 Everything is outdated
 yahaan kitaab naa milanaa, kitaab ke liye pahaad se utarana or phir chadhana he
 They either have to come to Haldwani or Delhi
 yaa kisi se mangani padati he
 Students say that the books of science are printed in 1987
 itihaas badal gaya magar kitaaben nahin badali hai
 Examination questions do not even match these books
 home science kii kitaab hi nahin milti he
 If it is not found in the library, then students have to go to Haldwani or Delhi and get a book or order it
 pithauragarh se haldwani tak aane main 8 se 10 ghante lag jate hai
 After 1990, the towns colleges were deliberately dismantled
 unki building to chamakaa di gai magar master nahin hai
 The college library was destroyed
 aisa nahin tha ki naujavaanon ne pehle kitaaben chhod di balki ek system ke tahat kitabon ko unase dur kar diya gaya
 When we did the university series, there was no such reaction
 chaatro ko fark hi nahin padaa ki unke college main shikshak nahin hai, kitaaben nahin hai
 Neither in Bihar nor in UP nor in Rajasthan
 pithauragarh ke chaatro ne pahal kii he to ab rajya main unase samarthan milane laga he
 As i said, this week is the most beautiful public movement
 shikshak pustak andolan naam he iskaa
 Social workers will also sit in support of this movement on Tuesday in Dehradun
 bharat main librari kii sthiti bahut karaab he
 On June 30, indiaspend published a detailed report on the Library of India
 iske anusaar 2011 kii janaganana main pehali baar public librari kii bhi ginati hui he
 It was then discovered that there are more than 70 thousand libraries in villages in India and 4580 in cities
 ek arab kii aabaadi ke liye choti badi librari kii kul sankhya 80,000 bhi nahin he
 In the US, the public library system serves 95 percent of the population
 har saal ek amareeki naagarik par 36 dollar kharch karata he, kareeb 2500 rupee
 Here 7 paisa is spent on a citizen in the name of library
 jab ham america jate hai to vahaan ke log mohalle yaa apane shahar kii librari dikhaane le jate hai
 It tells very proudly that you give a request for any book in the world, the library will make a manga
 hindi kii kitaab ho yaa bangla kii
 Here, students of Pithoragarh have to sit for books
 pithauragarh ke chaatro ko bhi nahin pataa ki agar unase prerit hokar har kasbe ke chaatr jaag gaye to padhane padhaane kaa kitna sundar maahaul ban jayega
 After Pithoragarh we take you to Pokaran
 bharat is jagah kaa naam kitna garv se letaa he
 In the context of Pokaran nuclear testing
 ab aap is post ko dekhie
 One day someone made Whats app from there
 'ye privet librari kaa poster he

 news paper
 The 5-hour reading fee is 350
 10 ghante ke liye 450 or 15 ghante ke liye 550 rupee lagenge
 Think about how much money a common student is spending to read
 public librari hoti to use kitni raahat milti
 It is another matter that students are more interested in Hindu Muslims and this is not an issue for them either
 pithauragarh ke chaatr thode alag hai
 Delhi is also suffering the pain of not having a library
 duusare rajyon se aae chaatro ko padhane ke liye librari janaa padataa he
 There is so much library in Gully locality that it is not accounted
 reeding room ke kaaran unka bajet bad gaya he lekin raajnneetik chetana kii itani kami he ki agar unase dugana paisa bhi le liya jaae to maa baap yahi kahenge ki haa chupchaap padho
 Do not struggle for the library
 tum padhane gaye ho
 Well don't worry about them, but there is a difference of knowledge from towns to villages
 logon ko maaloom hona chahie ki acchhee librari kaa hona or vahaan janaa sabaki zindagi badal sakati he
 Everyone i go to, will definitely see how their library is
 ve koun koun si kitaaben padhate hai
 That's because books have changed their lives

 desh ke sabase bade chunavi mahasamar main apni khaas ahmiyat rakhane vaale uttar pradesh main chunavi dangal is baar dilachasp hone ke asaar najar aa rahe hai
 In order to win the electoral riots in the state, two big national parties will be seen taking recourse to Gujarati stalking, while other parties are trying to sharpen their electoral edge
 uttar pradesh kii siyaasi jameen main gujarati daanv penchon se ladaai ladane ke liye bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) or congress ne jahaan chunavi varjish shuru kar di he, vahiin is chunavi ran main apane ko aage rakhane ke liye samaajawaadee party (sapa) or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) bhi jor aajamaane juty hui hai
 After the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) -one and UPA-II, the Congress is engaged in creating hat-trick by forming UPA-3 government
 party kii tamaam andruni siyasat ke baavjood narendra modi ko aage karne vaali bhaajapa bhi jaanati he ki is baar bhi agar vah samprag sarkaar kii tamaam khaamiyon ko bhunaa nahin pai to phir centre kii satta main waapas lautnaa uske liye sapane jaisaa hoga
 This is the reason why Narendra Modi is not being cared for by bjp-in-waiting BJP leader LK Advani, being presented as a trump card
 narendra modi ke liye bhi yah agnipariksha kii ghadi hogi
 For this, by making his most special warlord Amit Shah in charge of Uttar Pradesh, party president Rajnath Singh has tried to make the atmosphere of this place modimay
 shah ke daanvpenchon kaa tod nikaalane ke liye congress ne gujarat ke hi madhusudan mistre ko uttar pradesh kaa prabharee banaaya he
 Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of 80 Lok Sabha seats in the country
 rajya main bhaajapa or congress donon kii hi sthiti dawandol he
 In 2009, the Congress broke the bjp's dreams by performing in a bang in UP, but the party also knows that this time its path is very difficult
 sanghathan ke lihaaj se party abhi bhi puraani haalat main he
 BJP National President Rajnath Singh himself is from this state
 iske baad bhi party kaa kayakalp karne main naakaam rahe hai
 In the UP assembly elections too, other senior leaders including Rajnath Singh had made big claims, but when the results came out, all kept on saying only introspection and finding out the reason for the defeat
 ab rajnath ne shah daanv khelkar kuch nayaa karne kii sochi he
 But keeping the magic of Narendra Modi in Uttar Pradesh on the lines of Gujarat will be no less than a challenge for Shah

 Two months ago in March, India Today had shown some of Kashmir's worst stonemasons narrating their misdeeds with their own mouths
 inamen se ek jakir ahamed bat ne bataaya tha ki kis tarah usne ek car par petrol bam phenk kar do logon kii jaan le lee thi
 India Today showed Butt confessing to the camera how he used to get money from handlers
 unka sirf ek hi mansuba tha- ghati ko bandhak bana kar rakhana
 India Today's Special Investigation Team (SIT) has now exposed the cunning financiers of the stonemasons in their investigations
 ye hameshaa mana jaataa rahaa he ki kashmir ghati main garmiyon main failaai jane vaali gadabadi ke taar sarhad paar baithe spancers se jude hote hai
 But for the first time India Today has succeeded in gathering strong evidence in this regard
 in sabooton se saaf hota he ki ghati main dikhaae jane vaale gusse kii script kis tarah pakistan likhata he
 Also, the black letter of the real villains of the valley is also revealed
 hurriyat ke gilaani dhade kaa prantiy adhyaksh naeem khan se india today kii vishesh jaanch team ke under cover reporters ne sampark saadhaa or khud ko kaalpanik dhankuber bataate hue kashmir ke algaavvaadiyon ko funding kii ichha jataai
 Naeem then secretly reached Delhi to meet under-cover reporters
 naeem ne jo khulaase kiye wo chaunkaane vaale the
 Naeem Khan was caught on camera saying that 'pakistan has been beating hands and feet for the last 6 years to create a big demonstration in Kashmir
 ' ghati main hinsa ko badhaava dene ke liye kis str par paisa dhakela ja rahaa he, is par naeem khan ne kaha, 'pakistan se aane vaala paisa saikadon karod se zyada he, lekin ham or zyada kii ummid karte hai
 'this is only a small part in the string of unfolding revelations one after the other
 hurriyat netaa ne ye bhi saaf kiya ki kis tarah islamabad kaale dhan kii dhulaai ko bhi anjaam de rahaa he
 This is the first time any Kashmiri separatist leader has revealed this on record
 naeem khaanne kaha, 'fund har teen yaa chah maheene main aata he
 Sometimes the money comes through Saudi Arabia
 kabhi ye kistein katar ke jariye aati hai
 India Today investigates how the hawala business of separatists in the narrow streets of Ballimaran and Chandni Chowk, in the heart of the national capital, carries out this hawala business
 naeem khan ne kaha, 'sara paisa dilli se ghumkar aata he
 Affiliates of us deliver the funds after deducting their commission
 ' dilli ke raste aane vaale fund main kaaphi badhotaree hui he kyonki is tarah kii delivery ko sarhad paar se hone vaali smagaling se surakshit mana jaataa he
 a person with inside knowledge of Hurriyat also revealed the role of his group in burning schools
 kashmir main sardiyon ke chaar maheenon main 31 skulon ko aag lagaai gai
 About 110 government buildings were also damaged
 naeem khan ne badi shekhi ke saath in hamalon ko apane samarthan kaa zikr kiya
 Naeem Khan said, 'you need chaos for chaos
 ye matlab nahin rakhata ki iske myne chaahe railway stesan, police stesan, skool, panchayat imaaraten jalaana ho
 May Allah protect us, hospitals should be kept separate from this
 gadabadi ke liye hamen kuch khaas chije kerani hoti he
 'naeem Khan said with a twinkle in his eye,' they were burnt because we were present there
 hamaare samarthan ke bina kuch bhi sambhav nahin tha
 'the separatists have clearly maintained their roadmap
 kashmir ghati ko ubaale rakhana unke agenda main sabase upar aata he
 Layers of his insidious intent were revealed to India Today Undercover Reporters
 gaji javed baba taharik-e-hurriyat kaa netaa he
 Baba told the Under Cover Reporters- 'as long as it is financially compensated
 halaat kharaab rahenge
 Forget the bad, the strikes will continue
 virodh march nikaale jate rahenge
 No shop will be allowed to open, no vehicles will be allowed to run
 ' isi kadi main naeem khan ne joda- agar 300-400 karod rupye or jhonke jate hai to ashaanti teen maheene or tak khinchi ja sakegi
 We will have to burn more flags to prevent fatigue from showing its effect
 ye khulaasa shaitani he
 An amount as large as 400 crore rupees has been poured by Pakistan to spread fire from one city to another in the valley
 saath hi inke napak agenda main bhartiya jhandon ko jalaana bhi shaamil he
 Now the most surprising thing
 saiyad ali shah gilaani ke gurgey ne apane chif ke taar sidhe pakistan se jode
 Naeem Khan said, 'gilani's jamaat-e-islami is in Pakistan
 hamaare log vahaan hai
 Now whether he is with Nawaz Sharif or with others
 ' naeem khan ne ye bhi kaha, 'gilaani sahab hafeez said ke saath bhi kisi tarah sampark main hai
 Geelani is funded by Saeed from Kashmir
 main har cheez ke bare main nahin poochta lekin jahaan tak meri jaankaree main he, ye rakam 10-20 karod rupye se zyada he
 'this in itself is the first clear evidence that establishes a direct link between Geelani, one of Kashmir's leading separatists and India's most wanted Hafiz Saeed
 hurriyat ke insidar ke paas india today ke under cover reporters ke saamne khulaasa karne ko ab bhi bahut kuch baaki tha
 It also showed that in the last one year, there has been a lot of increase in the funding coming from Hafiz Saeed in Kashmir
 naeem khan ne kaha, wo (said) pehle itnaa sab kuch nahin karata tha
 It has its own organization
 lekin usne pichley saal kiya jo ki kaaphi thik tha
 Naeem also explained how the funding is divided among different separatist organizations
 naeem khan ne kaha, 'jab itnaa bada sanghathan chalaaya jaataa he, to kai jagahon par ye jaataa he

 Motorola launched the Moto Z2 Force in India in mid-february
 philhal isaki keemat 34,999 rupee he
 Force means strength, and this is its specialty
 company ne launch ke saath daawa kiya ki isaki screen tuutati nahin he
 Does this smartphone live up to the claims? You will know in this review
 kya kabhi na tuutane vaali screen de kar motorola apana is smartphone ko game changer bana sakati he? shaayad nahin
 That is why we have tested the Moto Z2 Force on every scale in the review
 parformens, camera, disple or bydaree life ye mukhya bindu hai jiske bare main aap is rivyuu main vistaar se janenge
 In this review you will read about the Moto Z2 Force drop test
 screen tuutati he yaa nahin?dizin or bild quality main kya he isamen khaas?photography ke liye smartphone kharid rahe hai to isamen kya he aapke liye khaas?parformens ke maamle main kahaan tikta he ye smartphone, kitna tej he?hang karata he yaa nahin?eps respons time kaisaa he or multi tasking kisi he?isi tarah ke sawaalon ke jawaab aapako is rivyuu main milenge
 The first thing you will notice as soon as you hold the design and build quality Moto Z2 Force is its sleekness
 yah smartphone kaaphi slee he or hold karne main kaaphi aasaan he
 The Moto z series smartphone has the option of applying the mod, so the rear panel is similar to one another
 metal body kaa smartphone he or rier main dual camera seoup diya gaya he or modul round he or camera bamp bhi aapak notice karenge, lekin ye isliye he, kyonki yahaan mode laga sakate hai
 For this smartphone, Motorola has used 7000 series alumina this time
 rier bottm main mode ko conect karne ke liye golden points dikhenge jisase mode conect kiye jate hai
 Talking about the current situation, this smartphone looks quite luxurious and premium from the rear, but from the front it feels a bit old
 aisa isliye kyonki trend bejal les disple kaa he or isaki disple bejal les nahin he balki puraane smartphone jaisi hi tradishnal he
 The reason behind this is that the company has not yet come to the technology that makes the shatterproof display bezel laces
 baharhaal phone ke front bottm main ovel shape vaala fingerprint scinar diya gaya he jo kaaphi fast or sateek he
 The display has a p OLED panel in the Moto Z2 Force, whose resolution is 2560X1440
 chunki disple hi isaki khaasiyat bhi he to iske liye company ne isamen shatter shield technology vaala glass yuj kiya he taaki girane se isaki screen naa toote
 Talking about the company's claim, Motorola has said that its display will never be broken nor will there be any crack in it
 disple main 535 picksal prati inch yani ppi he
 Colors are great, contrast is better and dark black is also better
 isliye chaahe gaming ho yaa video dekhnaa, hamaara anubhav behtareen rahaa he
 There is no problem browsing or viewing content on the display both in indoor and outdoor
 suraj kii raushnee main bhi disple ko aap aasaani se dekh sakate hai or pard sakate hai
 Overall, its display is great and our experience of using it has also been good
 drop test – hamane ise drop test main company ke daavon par khara paaya he
 On the floor we have dropped from 6 to 10 feet above
 hamen isamen koi bhi crack nahin dikhaa
 The special thing is that there was not even much scratch
 disple to shatter pruf he hi, lekin saath hi 7000 siries aluminium kii vajah se isaki body bhi majboot he, or is siries ko isi liye janaa jaataa he
 The performance Moto Z2 Force has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Qualcomm flagship processor of 2017 and it has Adreno 540 GPU
 isame 4GB ram he internal memory 64GB kii he or micro esady card kaa saport diya gaya he to aap isamen 2TB tak kii memory card laga sakate hai jo shaayad aapako milegi hi nahin
 In terms of performance, this smartphone is fast and performs the task comfortably
 hamane de tu de life main koi lag mahasoos nahin kiya he or gaming ke dauraan bhi yah phone acha kaam karata he
 After a while heavy gaming occurs or is hot
 ap loding time bhi kam he or ek ap se duusare ap main switch karnaa kaaphi smood he
 Motorola's specialty has been that it has the same user interface as stock Android, ie it does not get blotware except for some special apps of Motorola
 zyada customijeshan bhi nahin he or pyor android vaali feel bhi aapako milti he
 You can also do multi-tasking comfortably with this smartphone, although you do not get any more special features for it
 internet browjing, eps chalaanaa, colling karnas,video colling karnaa yaa phir email check karnaa
 You will not get to see many lags in all this
 cameraphotography ke liye Moto Z2 Force main dual rier camera seoup diya gaya he
 There are two camera sensors of 12 megapixels and aperture f / 2
 0 he
 Face detection autofocus is also provided
 do camera kyon he? mukhya camera sensor RGB he jabaki doosraa lens monocrome shoot karata he
 Bokeh effect is obtained by clicking
 monocrome se blike or white photo behatar aati he or yah RGB sensor ke saath mil kar acchhee quality kii tasviren taiyaar karata he
 Talking about the camera interface, it is similar to other Motorola smartphones
 photography indoor ho yaa outdoor ye aapako acchhee tasviren clic karke detaa he
 Talking about video, here you can also record 4K video at the rate of 30 frames per second
 photo or video kii quality behtareen he
 There is a lack of optical image stabilization and due to this the camera is slow which you notice
 phul echdi slo moshan videos record kar sakate hai or isamen aapako 120fps miltaa he
 The bokeh effect also looks good if the background is good, that is, the background blur is in a good way, if a little light is reduced then the background blur disappoints you
 outdoor photography acchhee he or clic kii gai tasveeron kii diteling se aap niraashan nahin honge
 After processing the photo, you get photos with accurate color and that's a good thing
 blike and white mod bhi acha he
 Shutter lag can sometimes bother you
 We've had this problem
 kul mila kar mudda ye he ki camera iskaa thik he acchhee tasviren clic karata he, lekin krantikari nahin he or ise or behatar kiya ja saktaa tha
 Battery Moto Z2 Force has a 2,730mah battery
 company kaa daawa do din kii bydaree life kaa tha jo, real life testing me niraash hi karata he
 The battery will last one day in regular use
 yani gane sunenge, soshal media check karenge or videos dekhenge to ise aap regular yuj kar sakate hai
 Its battery also gives good backup in video testing in loop
 kyon kharidenis smartphone main do chijen aisi hai jo shaayad kam hi smartphone main milengi
 The first is that if you break the smartphone often then it is definitely for you
 chaahe ye kaise bhi gire tuutegaa nahin
 The second is that mod has been supported in it
 bydaree byaap zyada chahie to bydaree mode laga lijie
 To improve the camera zoom, then there is a mod for this too
 360 degree camera atech karne ke liye bhi mode le sakate hai
 If you want good quality audio, you can also buy a mod for this
 ye suvidha is smartphone ko dusron se alag banaati he
 If you are a fan of Motorola, then this smartphone is very new and great for you
 kyon naa kharidenphotography main aivarej he, bydaree life kuch khaas nahin he or bejal les disple ke trend main yah handset front se puraane style kaa lagata he
