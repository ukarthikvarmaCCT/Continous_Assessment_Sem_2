 India are now the first Asian team to win a series in Australia
 And it feels wonderful to be able to say it
 - Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) January 7, 2019 After the historic victory, Team India captain Virat Kohli said, 'first of all i want to say that i have never been so proud to be a part of this team as it is now
 Used to be
 hamane ek samskruti viksit kii
 Our change started at this point where i took over as captain and i cannot believe that after four years we were able to win here
 main keval ek shabd kah saktaa hum ki mujhe is team kii aguwai karne main fakhr mahasoos hota he
 It is an honor for me
 khilaadiyon ke prayaas se hi captain acha sabit hota he

 ' Due to a political upheaval in Chhattisgarh, the credibility of former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi has been questioned
 ajit jogi ne nayaa elaan kiya he ki ab wo mukhyamantriraman singhke khilaaf chunaav nahin ladenge
 Earlier, Jogi had challenged Chief Minister Raman Singh that he would contest against him from wherever he contested
 is bayaan ke baad ajit jogi media main chaa gaye the
 He also made headlines in almost all the newspapers of the state but suddenly on Saturday Ajit Jogi overcame his promise
 jogi congress ke karyaalay se adhikrut bayaan aayaa ki wo chunaav nahin ladenge balki sabhi vidhaan sabha siton par prachaar karenge
 After this statement, his opponents have become aggressive regarding Jogi's credibility and strategy
 chhattisgarh main ajit jogi kii nai chaal se naa keval janata congress chhattisgarh kii vishwasaneeyata par sawaal khadaa ho gaya he, balki yah baat aam ho chali he ki rajya main chhattisgarh janata party sirf bijepi ko bahumat dilaane ke liye ek se badhkar ek daanv khel rahi he
 Politics pundits are now following the same belief
 jogi party kii ore se adhikrut bayaan aayaa he ki wo ab chunaav nahin ladenge , balki sabhi 90 siton par pratyaashiyon kaa prachaar karenge
 After this statement, the Congress has expressed the possibility that a secret electoral alliance has been formed between the BJP and Ajit Jogi's party
 pehle bhi apane vaadon se mukar chuke hai ajit jogiyah pehla mauka nahin jab ajit jogi apane bayaan se mukar gaye hon
 Even before this, he made politics hot by making a similar statement in the 2013 assembly elections
 bijepi ne jogi ke is faisle par taaja pratikriya jaahir karte hue kaha he ki wo mukhyamantri raman singh ke khilaaf chunavi maidan main utarane kii himmat nahin juta paae
 BJP spokesperson Srichand Sundrani said that to save his credentials, Jogi has decided not to field against the Chief Minister
 ek baar phir jogi ne varsh 2013 ke vidhaan sabha chunaav kii tarj par vaisaa hi daanv khelaa he
 Reacting to his sudden change of tactics, the Congress reacted sharply, calling the Jogi Congress the bjp's 'B' team
 congress adhyaksh bhupesh baghel ne kaha he ki ajit jogi bijepi ke mukhya sahyogi ke taur par chunavi maidan main hai
 To make the bjp's path easier, they have tied up with the BSP
 bhupesh baghel ne aage kaha ki mukhyamantri raman singh ke khilaaf chunavi maidan main naa utarane kaa faisla jogi kaa nahin balki bijepi ke nirdesh par hua he
 Baghel said that the Jogi Congress is throwing dust in the eyes of the gullible people of Chhattisgarh by calling it a decision of grand alliance under face saving
 congress ke netaa charandas mahant ne bhi ajit jogi ke rajanandgaanv se chunaav na ladane ke faisle par pratikriya jaahir karte hue kaha ki pehle wo congress ke bheetar rahakar bijepi ko phayda pahunchaaya karte the, lekin ab khuleam phayda pahunchaa rahe hai 
 He said that he has a well-established alliance with the BSP, while he is trying to form a BJP government for the fourth time by forming a secret alliance with the BJP
 charandas mahant kaa daawa he ki jogi ab koi bhi pintara khelen lekin rajya main congress sarkaar banaaegi
 On the other hand, Janata Congress spokesperson Nitin Bhansali has said that the political circumstances are different when Ajit Jogi announced to contest elections against Chief Minister Raman Singh
 unke mutabik pehle janata congress akele 90 siton par chunavi maidan main thi
 But after the alliance with BSP, the situation changed
 chhattisgarh congress adhyaksh bhupesh baghel ko kathith taur par naksali netaa ganpati ke phone aane par soobe me siyaasi bavaal much gaya he
 Behind this call, Bhupesh Baghel has termed the conspiracy by the ruling BJP and former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi's party to implicate him in the Naxalite trap
 bhupesh baghel ne ashanka jataai he ki is sajeesh main bijepi or ajit jogi kii party in donon ke alaava teesraa koi or nahin ho saktaa he
 Earlier, the state in-charge of the Congress PL Punia had given a statement regarding the Jhiram Valley scandal that Ajit Jogi is behind the Naxalite attack on Congress leaders
 bhupesh baghel ke mutabik piel puniya ke is bayaan ke baad naksali netaa ke naam se phone aana kai shankaaon ko janm detaa he
 In which no big conspiracy can be ruled out
 baghel kaa kahana he ki isse pehle bhi rajya ke mantri kii ashleel sidi cond main unhen bhi fansaane kii sajeesh hui thi
 But he and the Congress will not be afraid of such intrigues, neither bowing down nor stopping
 bhupesh baghelke is bayaan par bijepi pravaktaa shrichand sundarani ne palatwaar karte hue kaha he ki baghel surkiyon main bane rahane ke liye is maamle ko tool de rahe hai
 According to him, Baghel did not make a written complaint of the incident to the police first
 lekin maamle ko sansanikhej banane ke liye media kaa sahaara liya
 When he made headlines in newspapers and media, then filed a written complaint with the police
 bataa den ki mangalvaar der shaam chhattisgarh pradesh congress ke adhyaksh bhupesh baghel ko ek shaks ne phone kar apana parichay naksali netaa ganpati ke rup main diya
 In this two-minute conversation, Ganapathi, while discussing political equations with Baghel, also said that the Naxalites want to support the Congress
 or ve 37 vidhansabha siton ke parinaam badalane main sakasham hai
 After which, Baghel had given full details of the conversation with this alleged Naxalite leader to the police, anticipating a big conspiracy

 We are telling you about a giraffe that is 4 times taller than a common giraffe
 yah jiraph he julu, jisaki lambaai 19 feet he
 The 18-year-old Zulu, who lives in the Foley Farm House in Pembrokeshire, UK, is currently being touted as the world's longest giraffe
 is ju main iske saath teen or mail jiraph rahete hai lekin isaki lambaai in sabhi se khaasi zyada he
 Although the people engaged in its maintenance have no way of measuring its exact length, but when it is able to get out of the door 20 feet high, then it is estimated that it is somewhat longer than 19 feet
 'zulu' ko 5 saal pehle netherland se folli farm laayaa gaya tha
 The company that brought it here has a good experience of transporting such animals
 lekin ve bhi is lambey jiraph ko dekhakar hairaan the
 Tim, who is associated with Foley Farms, said he had never seen such a long before
 julu kaa vajan 1
 3 tons and due to this it is not easy to move it without her will
 uski care karne waalon ko is vajah se bhi uski asal lambaai naapane main dikkat aa rahi he
 The visitors to Foley Farm are often surprised to see Julu
 vah unke achraj kaa kendra he to julu bhi unki ore dostana ravaiya rakhata he
 He stares at the passengers on a platform, and he likes it when they touch him
 julu kii dekharekh kar rahe tim ne bataaya ki aam jiraph se aakaar main bada hone ke baavjood julu kaa vyavhaar kaaphi sanyamit he or vah anya jirafon ke saath milakar rahata he
 As far as food is concerned, 20 kilos of grass is given daily to Julu
 haalanki is regular diet ke alaava use 2-3 kilo extra khaanaa bhi chahie hota he
 The order has come in the form of a consultation
 yaad dilaate hue ki vakt vakt par aise suzav diye jate rahe hai
 In the same tradition, the cable act is reminded in 1995 and it has been said that all TV channels should refrain from showing such material which can provoke violence
 hinsa ko uksaava mil saktaa he
 Which encourages an anti-national view
 jo desh kii akhandta par asar karti he
 All channels are urged to strictly follow these guidelines
 isamen yah nahin likhaa he ki yah aadesh paanch saal se channelon par chal rahe hindu muslim dibet ko lekar he yaa assam ko lekar he? aadesh jis vakt aayaa us vakt assam ke log sadakon par the
 Before the passing of the citizenship law, there was strong opposition in the University of Assam
 assam ke alaava purvottar ke duusare ilaakon main bhi is kanoon kaa virodh ho rahaa he
 The Ministry of Information clearly writes that although the entire dock media is not showing the patriotism by showing the Assam protests, we want that the two four channels which are showing at times are also showing the national interest of Assam
 Do not do reporting
 charchaa na karen
 Is the performance of the people of Assam not justified? Is his performance anti-national? So should the government first declare the Assam protests anti-national? Violence is not taking place in Assam due to the display of channels
 channelon ke na dikhaane se unka gussa bhadkaa he
 If he felt that his words were being conveyed to the country, he would not have been so angry
 rajya sabha main paas hone tak assam ke saare pradarshan shantipurna hi rahen
 Demonstrating burning of tires and taking out processions with torches at night is neither violence nor anti-national protest
 agar assam ke pradarshnkaree hinsa karne kii galati karte hai to yah sarkaar kii zimmedaari he ki usne in logon se baat nahin kii
 Even now, when there are demonstrations, nobody is talking to them
 kya ye aadesh assam ke andolanon ko na dikhaane ke liye hai ? aise to koi haa main nahin kahegaa lekin aap ab channelon par assam ke kawarez ko lekar pasri chuppi se samaj sakate hai
 Here is the talk of you public
 aap chahen koi hon
 If you believe that this order is correct, then you postpone all your present and future demonstrations by declaring them anti-national
 khud ko bhi rashtravirohi ghoshit kar den
 Sugarcane farmers should sit on the field holding their ears that they have committed an anti-national mistake that they thought of agitating if they did not get the price and requested the media to show it
 aise na jane kitne naagarik samooh honge jo apni pareshaaniyon ko lekar sadak par utarane vaale honge

 is tarah ke adeshon kaa kya matlab he? sansad ke bheetar godse ko mahaan bataaya jaataa he
 Isn't that anti-national activity? Opposition to citizenship law is valid

 Many organizations and individuals are protesting

 Will all of them be declared anti-national? The Ministry of Information Broadcasting should name its Information Blocked Ministry in English

 Or you should pick up George Orwell's book directly from 1984 and keep the Ministry of Truth

 The ministry that tortured Orwell in 1984 is called the Ministry of Happiness

 Orwell's imagination seems to be coming true in India

 It would be a crime to know more and think more
 kya aap kareeb kareeb yahi hota nahin dekh rahe hai
 Dock media nothing else
 ministry of truth ke hi ang hai
 You tell me where are the information on these channels, is there any information about your protests or questions? When the media becomes a part of the government, bending over its orders, then people should think that why are you giving your time and money to this media? What is your responsibility as a citizen? Are you approving not to show opposition to anything? Are you agreeing not to protest? Are you agreeing that what the government says will be right? You are giving permission to end your citizenship
 jo aap par hi baari padegi
 Your slaps will become a wound

 You will not be able to bear the pain

 What will be found through these cracks? You have been silent on Kashmir

 To show that the Hindu Muslim who sang in the heat, you are above hatred, you are silent on that Muslim being left in this law
 aapkaa wo gaanaa sirf dikhaava tha
 Tomorrow will be silent about any other state or community
 ek din khud par beetegi to boli nahin niklegi
 Therefore, always encourage speaking in democracy

 Batting batsman Virat Kohli, who played a key role in helping India win by seven wickets in the third ODI on Sunday at the Punjab Cricket Association ground against New Zealand, says that all the teams of the world want him out as quickly as possible

 upar jo tasviir aap dekh rahe hai, yah model toun vidhansabha kshetra kaa sangam park ilaaka he
 
 
 By the way, Sangam means the union of two rivers, but there are no rivers here, the dirty drains under the house are definitely seen
 
 
 baahar se saaf-suthra dikhne vaala sangam park bheetar se 'natkhat' naaliyon se nark bana hua he
 
 
 The area has three blocks, and around 15,000 people live in 1,600 houses
 
 
 lagbhag har ghar ke baahar sidhiyon ke paas aapako aisi gandi naaliyaan dikhti hai, jinase nikalataa ganda pani gharon tak bhi pahunchataa he, lekin majaboor log kahin ja nahin sakate, or kai-kai shikayaton ke baavjood sthiti nahin badali
 
 
 People also have many other problems
 
 
 pichley kuch mahino se yahaan pine kaa pani bhi ganda aa rahaa he, or us pani main itani gandagi hoti he ki pite hi aap biimaar ho jaaen
 
 
 You can see the picture above
 
 
 baaltee main jo pani dikhaai de rahaa he, yah pine ke liye supplai kiya hua pani he, or yahaan ke nivaasiyon ko pehle kareeb 10 baaltee aisa pani phenkna padataa he, phir kuch saaf pani aata he, jo bottle main dikhaai de rahaa he
 
 
 But even this bottled water is not drinkable
 
 
 ganda to he hi, isamen se badboo bhi aati he
 
 
 People use it for bathing and washing clothes, and have to buy water to drink
 
 
 yah jo tasviir aap dekh rahe hai, yah sangam park ke paas se nikalate railway trek ke aas-paas ke ilaake kii he
 
 
 Around 1,000 people live around the track
 
 
 ye log yahaan ke mul nivasee to nahin, lekin pichley 15 saal se yaheen rah rahe hai
 
 
 Voter cards are also made and they vote, but there is nothing serious about their problem
 
 
 in jagahon par itani gandagi faili hui he ki logon kii tabiyat rose karaab hoti he to aspataal main daakhil tak karnaa padataa he
 
 
 Many times, due to lack of money, people here also work with indigenous medicines
 
 
 dilli ke model toun vidhansabha kshetra kii aisi tasviir dekhte hi aapako lagegaa, shaayad hamaare netaaon ko is samasya ke bare main pataa nahin hoga or isiilie samaadhaan nahin ho paaya he, lekin sachai yah nahin he
 
 
 People said that the problem is very old
 
 
 bhale hi koi bhi sarkaar rahi ho, samasyaayein jas kii tas hai
 
 
 Before every election, politicians come to the area and leave with big promises, but after winning the elections they forget these people
 
 
 lekin phir bhi yahaan ke log har chunaav main ek nai ummid ke saath inhen netaaon ko jitate hai, lekin inaki samasya kaa koi hal nahin kiya jaataa
 
 
 This time, candidates of every party had come here before the Delhi Assembly elections and promised to solve their problems
 
 
 chunaav se pehle har hafte lagbhag teen-chaar baar har party ke ummidavaar yahaan aa rahe the, lekin chunaav ke baad yahaan kisi kaa bhi aana lagbhag band ho gaya he
 
 
 The MLA of this area, Akhileshapati Tripathi, has taken many problems with people here, but no solution was found
 
 
 agar vidhayak yahaan aate bhi hai to jhanda fahraane yaa kisi function main shirkat karne
 
 
 Madhavprasad of BJP has been a corporator from here for the last nine years, but he too did not find any solution
 
 
 logon kaa kahana tha ki jab log samasya lekar madhavaprasad ke paas jate hai to jawaab miltaa he, ki aapane hamen vot nahin diya he, jinhen vot diya he, unheen ke paas jaaie
 
 
 Many times it has even been answered that we do not need your vote, we can win without it
 
 
 is baar dilli vidhansabha chunaav se pehle har party kaa ummidavaar yahaan aayaa tha or inaki samasya ke samaadhaan kaa vaada kar gaya tha
 
 
 Before the election, candidates of every party were coming here about three to four times every week, but after the election, the arrival of anyone here has almost stopped
 
 
 is ilaake ke vidhayak akhileshpati treepathi ke paas yahaan ke log kai baar samasyaayein lekar gaye hai, lekin koi samaadhaan nahin mila
 
 
 Even if the MLA comes here, hoisting the flag or attending any function
 
 
 bijepi ke madhavaprasad yahaan pichley nau saal se nigam parshad hai, lekin unhone bhi koi hal nahin nikaala
 
 
 People used to say that when people go to Madhavaprasad with a problem, they get the answer, that you have not voted us, go to those who have voted
 
 
 kai baar yah jawaab tak diya gaya he ki hamen aapke vot kii zarurat hi nahin, ham uske bina bhi jeet sakate hai

 shi ne nayi kendriya samiti ke sadasyon kii kaaryshaala main kaha, ‘hamen tathyon main satya kii talash karenge or bataaenge ki kya mahatvapurn he or kya nahin
 'chinese-specific socialism by Teng Xiaoping is the only way that can be adopted to create a society that is prosperous in every way and to enhance socialist modernization
 unhone party ke sadasyon ko yaad dilaayaa ki teng ke daur se pehle china jis sthiti main tha vahi sthiti aaj he
 Teng, who assumed power after Mao, had put forward the concept of Chinese-specific socialism 31 years ago
 shi ne kaha ki sudhaar aitihaasik faisla sabit hua or kaha ki pichley china dashak main china ne jo pragati kii usase vah vishwa kii duusari sabase badi arthvyavastha ban gaya
 Xi is currently the Vice President and he was elected the new General Secretary of the party in place of Hu Jinto
 vah march main raashtrapati kaa pad grahan karenge jabaki hu is pad se sevanivrutt honge
 Xi Teng is considered a supporter, but this is the first time Xi has directly discussed Mao's era in China, while following a radical leftist ideology

 In such a big question arises that when will this frozen snow melt and when will the people of Delhi get its budget? Opposition has started raising questions on this delay of CM Arvind Kejriwal government
 khaskarcongressparty ne bajet pesh hoga bhi yaa nahin isapar sawaal karne shuru kar die hai
 Taking a dig at the delay of the Kejriwal government, the Congress has said that Arvind Kejriwal does not have the experience of running the government
 is vajah se dilli main sanvaidhanik sankat utpann ho gaya he
 The session of the Delhi Legislative Assembly is going to take place from next Friday, but so far neither the government nor the officials are aware of the budget session

 But this time Nitish will have to field a strong candidate
 gathbandhan kaa aadhaar vot lekar bijepi chali gai he or yadavon kaa bada hissaa argedy main he
 Naval Kishore Rai, who has been MP from Sitamarhi many times, has come to JDU and has stood like a mountain in front of his own party Arjun Rai
 naval kaa sitamarhi or shivahar, donon siton par asar he
 On the other hand, the names of former RJD MP Sitaram Yadav, District Council President Indrani Devi and former MLA Jayanandan Yadav are going on
 bijepi se vidhayak sunil pintu, vidhayak ramanaresh yadav or vidhaan parshad vaidyanath prasad taal thok rahe hai
 But to capture this seat at any cost, BJP can also bet on any external and weighty candidate
 bijepi ke liye kuch zyada hi hode netaaon main dikh rahi he
 Almost all the seats of JDU and RJD and former mps are BJP ticket seekers

 It has been 10 years for his lawmaker
 sitamarhi nayaa 'yadavaland' banakar ubhara he
 Stronger than Madhepura in many ways as the number of Brahmins and Rajputs in Madhepura has increased after delimitation
 sitamarhi main iske baad bhoomihaar-brahman hai or khaasi taadaad main vaisya samooh hai
 In such a situation, the claim of both BJP and RJD in Sitamarhi is not weak

 box offis par nuksaan kii maar jhel raheen bollywood filmein kab aa rahi hai or kab ja raheen pataa hi nahin chal paa rahaa he
 The main reason for the box office movies being beaten is not just because it cannot be said that the film 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil' has been successful in making good box office collections in comparison to the recent release films
 chaahe munafa utana nahin hua jitne kii ummid lagaai ja rahi thi lekin film ne 100 karod rupee ke club main to entry kar hi lee
 After all, what was the reason that 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil' remained at the box office even compared to the latest release
 aaie jaane:bada binarsaal bhar main kitni hi acchhee-buree yaa choti-badi filmein relies hon lekin diwaali relies kaa har senepremi ko intajar rahata he
 Because this special date of the year is already booked for a big banner film
 is baar karan johar ke dharma production or fox studios ke binar tale bani film 'i dil he mushkil' ko diwaali par relies kiya gaya
 However, there was a lot of controversy about banning the film due to which the film got more screens in multiplexes rather than single screens
 baavjood iske film kii weekend collection acchhee rahi film ne opening weekend main 41
 05 crores earned
 videshi kamai kaa asarfilm trade analist atul mohan ne is film kii box offis report ke bare main bataaya ki film kaa kul bajet 70 karod tha jiske chalate puri deal 60-65 karod main final hui
 Apart from this, 30 to 49 crores were engaged in satellite rights
 film ne deshbhar main 105 karod rupee (net) kii kamai kii or videshon main film ne 60(net) karod rupee kii kamai darj karwaai
 In this way the film grossed 165 crores (net)
 shivaay varsej i dil he mushkilisamen koi do raay nahin ki film'i dil he mushkil'ke craij ke aage ajay devgan kii film 'shivaay' ko kuch khaas rispons nahin mila

 theatres main 'shivaay' ke mukaable i dil
 
 
 Footfall was more visible for 'ae Dil Hai'
 
 
 ' film ne kamai ke maamle shivaay ko kaaphi peeche chhod diya
 Music is an important role
 As much as the filmmakers work hard to make films, they are also working hard to prepare the songs of the film
 film kaa mujeec hit ho ye sunishchit karne ke liye mekars song mekking par karodon rupee kharch kar rahe hai
 Because they have understood this very well, the hit music of the film plays an important role in pulling the audience to the theater somewhere
 karan johar kii film 'i dil he mushkil' ke sabhi gaano ko khub pasand kiya gaya, abhi tak film ke gane chartbeet par top par jagah banaae hue hai
 In this way the hit music of the film made an impact on the earning somewhere
 haalanki haal hi main 'tum bin' jaisi musical romantic film bhi relies hui lekin 'i dil he
 
 
 There was no special magic of 'tum Bin' in front of the music of 'if only one Jagjit Singh's Ghazal was left
 notebandi se pehle film kaa relies honofilm trade analist atul mohan kaa kahana he ki philhal notebandi kii ghoshan ke baad se hi film 'i dil he mushkil' kii kamai kaa graph bilkul gir gaya he
 If the audience is not getting luck on newly released films, then 'ae Dil'
 
 
 ' ke liye darshakon kii ummid karnaa bekaar he
 The film had to earn what it was before 8 November (the announcement of demonetisation on this day)
 Now the film seems to be disappearing from the box like other films

 Continental said in a statement that all American airlines operating flights to the US follow it in most countries of the world, no relaxation of this is possible
 qandahar or kabul main swatantra maanavadhikaar ayog ke adhikariyon ne bhi is ghatana kii pushti kii he
 The comments (input ffp se) (input from AFP) (input ffp se) Many such media reports have surfaced that the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) was reportedly aware of the financial malfunction of diamond trader Mehul Choksi before the Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam was revealed on 31 January 2018
 reports main kaha gaya ki PMO ne logon se mili shikayaton kii suchi bhi banaai or inhen mantralayon or sambandhit agenciyon ko bheja gaya
 Apart from the investigating agencies, the Finance and Home Ministry were asked to find out whether any investigation was pending against Mehul Choksi or any action was ever taken against him
 in reports main kaha gaya ki ye sab 2017 main ho rahaa tha jab mehul chokasee kii ore se antigua or barbuda kii naagarikta ke liye die aavedan kii jaanch chal rahi thi
 To find out the letters sent by the PMO, 'india Today' sent a petition to the PMO under the Right to Information (RTI) Act
 hamane poocha ki ‘kya PMO ne grih mantralay ko ye pataa lagane ke liye chitthee bheji ki 2017 main chokasee ke khilaaf koi jaanch lambit he yaa uske khilaaf koi karrwai kii gai? agar jawaab haa main he to chitthee kii prati or grih mantralay kii ore se piemo ko bheje gaye jawaab kii prati uplabdh karai jaae
 The PMO got this answer on the first question - 'the question of the applicant is a moving (roving) inquiry rather than asking for special inputs
 maangi gai soochna ke vishyak spasht nahin he
 "therefore, the information sought by the applicant under the provisions of section 6 (1) and section 2 (f) of the RTI Act 2005 does not fall under the definition of information
 ”, “or duusare sawaal kaa jawaab dena bhi pehle sawaal ke jawaab ke hi sandarbh main ‘upyukt nahin’ he"
 According to the Oxford Dictionary, roving means traveling continuously without fixing any destination (destination)
 rowing ko ghumkkadi se bhi badla ja saktaa he
 Roving in the Cambridge Dictionary means traveling from one place to another
 ye samaj se pare he ki PMO ne kyon rowing shabd kaa istemaal kiya? or ye poochna kaise saaf (specific) nahin he ki PMO ne grih mantralay ko kya chitthee likh kar poocha tha ki 2017 main mehul chokasee ke khilaaf koi jaanch lambit thi yaa uske khilaaf koi karrwai kii gai?jawaab se asantusht hone kii vajah se dobaaraa PMO main apil daakhil kii gai
 The response to this appeal from 'SH Rizvi, Director and Appellate Authority' is as follows
 “maine is maamle se jude records check kiye
 It was found that your questions were prepared in a manner that is of the nature of a questionnaire in which the states of action have been sought to know in the context of the pmo's stand in the matter
 ye spasht kar diya gaya he ki jo jaankaree maangi gai he wo rowing (chalate-phirte poochtacha) he or spacific (vishisht) nahin he
 Therefore, the stand of CPIO, PMO is that seeking information does not come under the definition of information under the RTI Act, 2005 and the answer given in this regard is correct
 ”aisa lagata he piemo ne ‘rowing inquairi’(chalate-phirte poochtacha) jumale kaa istemaal mudde ko dhakne yaa andekhi karne ke liye he
 The Modi government is constantly being attacked by the opposition for fleeing the country of Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi
 congress kaa aarope he ki PMO ne mehul chokasee ke khilaaf shikayaton kii andekhi kii or uske desh se bhaag jane ko ‘aasaan’ kiya
 Against this backdrop, the government could have faced further embarrassment by making the letter public
 aisa lagata he ki naagarik ke soochna lene ke adhikaar ko hi ‘rowing’kar diya gaya he
 Under the RTI, it seems that depending on the question being asked, how high the level of discomfort will be
 jab piemo se sawaal kiya gaya to soochna kaa adhikaar hi uske paimaane se rowing ho gaya
 BJP Spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has said that Kirendra Modi is Yamraj, for the first time Congress has spoken the right thing
 modi bhrashtachariyon ke liye, ghotalebaajon ke liye or deshadrohiyon ke liye yamraj hai or desh ke logon ke liye sartaaj hai, isliye yamraj se dar to lagegaa hi
 Naqvi said Kikangreski farewell time has come
 bijepi pravaktaa ne kaha ki pichley kuch dinon se lagaataarcongress party ke mantrior netao main thodaa janun sa chal rahaa he
 They feel that our power is going now
 beimaanon kii baraat kii vidaai kaa samay jab aata he, to ve bahut ghabaraate hai
 The time has come for the dishonest to farewell, and the public is standing to play their farewell by playing the band
 nakvi ne kaha ki congress party kya he, din bhar sonia gandhi, sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi, rahul gandhi, karte-karte unka haajama bura ho jaataa he to apane hajme ko thik karne ke liye ek baar modi ji kaa naam le lete hai
 Significantly, on Friday, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi compared Congress Spokesperson Rashid Alvi with Yamraj
 congress ne aaj rajani patil ko himachal pradesh kaa prabharee banaaya or bihar evam gujarat ke liye do-do prabharee sachiv bhi niyukt kiye

 party ke mutabik, ye sabhi niyuktiyaan tatkaal prabhaav se lagu hai Think if every color was white or black, then perhaps there would be a lack of energy in us
 yah rangon kaa asar hi he jisase hamaare andar sadbhaavna, prem, karunaa jaise bhav paidaa hote hai
 Every color has some effect on our life
 yah to aap jaanate hi honge ki surya kii roshni kisi chiz se takaraakar jab paravartit hoti he to ye paravartit kirane hi hamaare dimag ko rangon kii pahchaan karaati hai
 These colors affect our fortune and emotions
 bhagya par rangon kaa asarduniya main mukhya rup se do hi shaktiyaan kaam karti hai, 'rang' or 'tarang'
 It is from this that the whole world works
 har vyakti or vastu kaa alag-alag rang hota he
 In the same way, our words and our emotions also have their color
 rang hamaare jivan main prem badhaate bhi hai or dooriyaan bhi laate hai
 All the planets, constellations and astrology work on the basis of colors
 yahaan jaanate hai ki koun-sa rang hamaare bhagya ko kis tarah prabhavit karata he -laal rang kaa prabhavlaal rang atyant urja or shakti kaa rang he
 In astrology, the color red is considered to be the color of Mars and the sun
 yah prem kii shuruyaat ke liye acha hota he lekin use jari rakhane ke liye nahin
 It is good to use red color in curtains and sheets
 haalanki ghar kii deevaaron kaa rang laal nahin hona chahie
 At the same time, red color should be used at least in the bedroom
 pile rang kaa prabhavapila rang shubh chizon or mangal kaaryon se sambandh rakhata he
 In astrology, it is considered the color of Jupiter
 pile rang kaa sambandhdosti se he, lekin romance se nahin
 By the way astrology says that the use of yellow color to convert friendship into love is beneficial
 vaivaahik jivan main pile rang kaa prayog nahin karnaa chahie
 Yellow color should not be used normally in the bedroom
 haa, santanheen hon to kuch samay ke liye pile rang kii bedshit bichhaaen or bedroom main pile rang ke pardon kaa bhi prayog karen
 The green color is directly related to good health and mood
 jyotish main ise budh kaa rang mana jaataa he
 It is effective in healing any pain and wounds
 romance main hare rang kaa prayog karne se prem ke tuutane kaa khatra nahin hota
 The light green color in the bedroom creates both love and patience in married life
 halkaa haraa rang kaa deevaaron, pardon or chaadaron main prayog karnaa chahie
 The blue color effect is related to intense spirituality and luck
 jyotish main nila rang shubh shani kaa rang mana jaataa he or yah romance main darshan paidaa karata he
 Blue color makes the lover philosophical
 lekhak, kavi yaa darshanik hai to apane bedroom main halkaa nila rang prayog kar sakate hai
 It is also considered the color of concentration and intelligence
 bangnee rang kaa prabhavabangnee rang vilasita or bhoga kaa rang he
 The 'kama' sense is strengthened by its use
 bangnee rang vyakti ko romance or prem main shaareerik anand kii ore le jaataa he
 You can use this color in every way in the bedroom after marriage
 gulabi rang kaa prabhaavagulabi rang shukr, chandra or mangal kaa sanyukt rang mana jaataa he
 It is also considered the greatest color of love
 kisi ke bhi bedroom kii deevaaron ke liye gulabi rang sarvottam he
 But one thing to note here is that dark pink color should be used in curtains and sheets
 haalanki gulabi rang kishoravastha main buree tarah bhatkaav paidaa karata he, isliye umr ke is daur main isse bachanaa chahie

 He got the post of Assistant Engineer
 naukari ke pehle 20 varsh to bade aaraam se cat gaye
 But when it came to the 2001 seniority list of these engineers, the birth dates of many of them were found to be wrong
 jaanch ke liye jab mul dastavejon kii talash kii gai to unki niyukti sambandhi filein hi gaayab milin
 Officers came in a hurry
 har jagah filon kii khoj hui, lekin nateeja sifer
 The department took fourteen years to find the files
 antat: 13 farvari ko vibhaag ke vishesh sachiv chhotelal paasi ne lakhanu ke hajratganj thane main gum filon ke sambandh main agyaat logon ke khilaaf report darj kara di
 If the files related to the appointment of engineers were lost, then 400 files were not found in Kanpur Municipal Corporation, on the basis of which one lakh rupees
 yaa usase zyada kaa house tex vasula janaa tha
 The officers not only caused revenue loss to the municipal corporation but also hid the files
 iskaa khulaasa tab hua jab nagar ayukta umesh pratap singh ne 21 janvari ko ek aadesh jari kar aisi sabhi filein talab kin, jinamein ek lakh ru
 House tax of more than Rs
 nagar nigam ab police kii sharan main jane kii taiyaari main he, lekin police kii peshaani par bal to kisi or vajah se padaa hua he
 The file regarding the appointment of tainted Chief Engineer Arun Mishra of Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Corporation (UPSIDC) has disappeared from the Secretariat with High Security
 hycourt kii sakhti ke baad police ne sachivalay ke sahaayak samiksha adhikari harendra tiwari ko 28 disambar ko giraftaar bhi kiya lekin file abhi tak gaayab he
 Actually, there is no such government department in Uttar Pradesh, where at least a dozen necessary files have not disappeared
 lagaataar hytech ho rahe pradesh main filon kaa rakrakhaav ab bhi ek chunauti bana hua he
 At the government level, more than 100 new files are created every day in all departments of UP, but there is no system to monitor the old files
 isiilie sarkari vibhaagon main filein gaayab karne kaa khel chal rahaa he
 By 1999, at least one reference donor or reference clerk was stationed in all 369 sections of the state secretariat
 inkaa kaam sambandhit section main jitani bhi filein hai, unki suchi bananaa, nigaraanee karnaa or yadi koi maamla aae to usase sambandhit file adhikari ko dena tha
 In 1999, all the reference donors were promoted and made review officers
 iske baad se filon kii nigaraanee kii vyavastha charmara gai
 "there is no proper system of maintenance of files in the secretariat offices," says a deputy secretary posted in the Office of the Commissioner of Agricultural Production
 kuch jaagruk samiksha adhikari hi sandarbh-daata kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 In a meeting with the Commissioner of Agricultural Production last month, officials proposed to restore the system of referrers
 ''sachivalay se gaayab ho rahi filon par nigaraanee rakhane ke liye sarkaar ne sinchai vibhaag ke anubhaagon main filon kii baar koding shuru kii he
 On scanning the code with a bar code scanner, a soft copy of the entire file is exposed to the computer
 sachivalay prashasan ke sachiv prabhaat mittal kehete hai, ''shashan ke sabhi anubhaagon kaa aadhunikeekaran kiya ja rahaa he, jisase filon kii nigaraanee kii vyavastha behatar hui he
 The duplicate file was sent by the Sportsperson and Vigilance Department to the government for action, but many files were found missing from the department concerned
 sakhti hui to vibhaagon ne dupliket file banaakar pallaa jhaad liya, par mukhya sachiv alok ranjan ne jaanch kaa aadesh dekar inke mansoobon ko paravaan chadhane se roak diya
 During the BSP regime, a secretary-level officer posted in the Secretariat received a file which was stained with adverse comments
 is par koi faisla lene se bachane ke liye adhikari ne mul file almaari main band karvaa di or dupliket par manamafik tippanee likhakar faisla kar diya
 In fact, only 50 to 60 percent of any missing file can be made a duplicate file
 is gorakhdhandhe ke saamne aane par mukhya sachiv karyaalay ne sabhi sarkari karyaalayon main dupliket file yani 'temprari cover' (tisi) kholane par roak laga di he
 There is also news of a relief between the continuously missing files of the monitoring system and the negligence in their maintenance
 pichley varsh mukhyamantri karyaalay main 'file monitering system' lagu karne ke kuch behatar nattejey saamne aane lage hai

 aise main lalu ne kaha he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ko 30 disambar ke baad janata se sajaa paane ke liye apana manapsandchaurahaadhund lenaa chahie

 This incident is two years old

 According to these reports, the incident took place in Cairo, Egypt in 2017

 The masked man was apprehended by the locals due to his suspicious activities
 baad main pataa chalaa ki vah mahila ke bhesh main bachche chori karne kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 It was thus clear that this incident has nothing to do with the protests in Jamia regarding the Citizenship Amendment Act

 Virat Kohli, who came out to bat for the first time at number four, Sachin Tendulkar's favorite, finished the innings of South Africa's fiery attack and played a brilliant century and named India on the first day of the first Test cricket match
 bharat ne toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karte hue din kaa khel samaapt hone tak paanch wicket par 255 ran banaae
 The highlight of the Indian innings was Kohli's 119 runs, which is also the highest score of his career
 unhone chauthe number par tendulkar kii kami nahin khalane di
 Kohli stepped into the crease at a time when India's score was 24 for two
 ajinkya rahane ne chathe number par apana chayan sahi sabit kiya
 Like Kohli on a fast and bouncy pitch, he also gave a befitting reply to every attack by the South African fast bowlers
 vah abhi 43 ran banaakar khel rahe hai
 With him at the other end, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has scored 17 runs
 dakshin africa ne 80 over ke baad nai gend le thi, lekin in donon ne bharat ko isse nuksaan nahin pahunchane diya

 duusare satr main cheteshwar pujaara (25) or rohit sharma (14) pavilion laute, lekin is bich bharat 94 ran jodne main safal rahaa
 India lost only Kohli's wicket in the third session and meanwhile scored 91 runs
 kohli 257 minute krij par rahe or unhone 181 gend ke saamana karke 18 chauke lagaae
 He added 89 runs for the third wicket with Pujara, recovering from two aftershocks

 Kohli did not always stay at the crease for a long time after reaching the 100-run mark in Test cricket and hence he took caution today
 yah star ballebaaj apane kariyar kaa sarvocch score banane main safal rahaa, lekin bade shatak kii unki khwaahish puri nahin ho pai
 Kohli drives an outside ball from Kallis and makes an easy catch at cover

 He did not make the mistake of hitting the outside balls and scored runs when he got the chance

 Kohli specially targeted Imran Tahir
 unhone 76 gendon par apana aathvaan test ardhashatak puraa kiya
 He led the score quickly in the next two overs as well, but it was a wrong decision to call Pujara for a run as there was no run
 kohli ne midwicket kii taraf gend kheli or teji se ran ke liye daudane lage, lekin vah jaldi hi palat gaye
 By then Pujara had reached the middle crease
 taahir ke thro par amala ne unhen ran out kar diya

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main narendra modi ke netritv vaale endie ko maat dene ke liye telugu desham party (tidipi) ke adhyaksh en chandrababu naidu vipakshi dalon ko ekajute karke 'neshnal front' banane kii kavayad main jute hai

 In such a situation, the question arises, how different is Naidu's effort from mamta-kcr? Naidu, who broke away from the NDA, has taken the initiative to form a National Front with Congress for non-bjp parties
 itnaa hi nahin, telugana vidhansabha chunaav main unki party congress ke saath milakar chunaav lard rahi he
 Naidu has also started a meeting with leaders of opposition parties by meeting Congress President Rahul Gandhi

 Apart from this, there are many such parties, which are neither part of UPA nor NDA
 unhen bhi is front se jodne kii hamaari koshish he
 Whereas, Congress was not made a part of TMC chief Mamata Banerjee and KCR who started the exercise to create a National Front
 mamata vipakshi dalon ke netaaon se mulaakaat karne ke baad aakhri main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kii thi

 In view of this, he invited the leaders of such parties to meet and come together
 kesiar kisi bhi surat main congress ko apane gathbandhan kaa hissaa nahin bananaa chaahate the
 It is clear that where Mamta wanted support from Congress
 vahiin, kesiar congress ke bagaiyr gathbandhan banane main jute the
 Whereas Chandrababu Naidu, apart from these two leaders, is engaged in uniting opposition parties regarding the Congress
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki naidu apni koshishon main kitna kaamyaab hote hai? The anger of Akali Dal leaders about Rahul Gandhi's rally in Punjab is constantly increasing towards Rahul Gandhi and Congress

 None of the Akali Dal leaders including the Chief Minister of Punjab were invited to the inauguration
 isse khafa mukhyamantri badal ne pradhanmantri ko chitthee likhakar ise ek galat parampara bataate hue centre va rajyon ke sambandhon ke khilaaf bataaya tha
 But the anger of the Akali Dal has not calmed down even further
 lihaaja ab akali dal ne elaan kiya he ki jahaan rahul gandhi ne raily kii thi, thik usee jagah par sangrur main akali dal ke netaa rahul gandhi kii raily se badi raily karenge
 Also, Sukhbir Badal and Prakash Singh Badal will be honored by giving them gold medals for taking the initiative for the hospital in this rally
 akali dal ke jan sevak prem singh chandoomaajaraa ne kaha he ki is hospital ke nirmaan ke liye saare kaam badal sahab ne kiye hai
 The state government has also given land for free and health is an issue of the state government, but the Congress people have put the wrong tradition here
 badal sahab ko bulaayaa tak nahin gaya isiilie ab akali dal usee jagah par congress se badi raily karegaa or prakaash singh badal ko gold medal dekar sammanit bhi karegaa

 Usually, users click on the check box of these permission
 kyonki lagbhag sabhi ap yugers se is tarah kii parmishan kii maang karata he
 This Malway app allows users to request only those permissions so that they can connect to their fraud server
 itnaa hi nahin in parmishan main esemas bhejne or risive karne se lekar samvedansheel jaankariyaan churaana bhi shaamil he
 This malware sends premium SMS without informing the user and registers for paid service without telling the user

 Although the checkpoint has said that even though these apps have been removed from the Google Play store, they will continue to harm those smartphones until the users manually delete them
 desh ke varisht dalit netaa main shumaar kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan kaa kahana he ki una main daliton par hua atyaachaar ek 'choti ghatana' thi
 Lok Janshakti Party chief Paswan has gone door-to-door campaigning for the BJP in the Gujarat assembly elections
 times of india ke mutabik, yahaan unhone mediakarmiyon se baatcheet main kaha, main itnaa kahana chahta hum ki choti-moti ghatnaayen hoti rahati hai
 Such incidents also happen in our Bihar
 gujarat main ek choti si ghatana ho gai
 
 
 Una (incident) occurred
 gujarat main khub hangaamaa much
 
 
 But the government's job is to take action
 jab bhi aisi ghatana hoti he, to uske baad kya kadam uthaae gaye yah mahatvapurn he
 Paswan said that Gujarat is the focal point of India and he should be proud that the most popular Prime Minister of the country is from this state
 una ghatana ko lekar paswan ke is bayaan par rashtriya dalit adhikaar manch ke sanyojak or rajya main dalit chehre ke taur par ubhar jignesh mevani ne aalochana kii he
 He called Paswan's resignation, calling it an "embarrassing statement"
 mevanine kaha, 'una main daliton par atyaachaar ko choti ghatana bataane vaala paswan kaa bayaan sharmnaak or un daliton ke jakhm par namak chhidakane jaisaa he, jinhen adhananga karke peeta or shahar main ghumaya gaya
 Around 30 Dalits consumed poison during protests across the state over the incident, with roads and rail lines stalled
 yah ek nirmam ghatana thi
 We demand that the BJP resigns Paswan ji for making such a shameful statement
 'haalanki jab paswan se poocha gaya ki july 2015 main una main daliton kii pitayee ko 'choti ghatana' bataate hue ise nyyochit bataane kii koshish kar rahe hai, to vah saaf kiya ki 'dalit par kahin bhi hua atyaachaar nyoyochit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 i say that PM Modi has already said on a public platform that any anti-social activity of cow protection will not be tolerated
 ' Along with getting pregnant, a crowd of mentors and mentors tell the pregnant woman, some of which are really useful, but most of them are based on superstition and hearsay
 garbhvatee mahilaayein, aise samay main shaareerik or maansik badlaav se guzar rahi hoti hai, aise main ek andruni dar hameshaa bana rahata he or yahi dar unhen in bhrantiyon ko maanane ke liye majaboor karata he
 Myth - 1
 garbhvatee mahila ke saamne sundar se bachche kii tasviir lagane se hone vaala baccha bhi khubasurat paidaa hota he
 Reality - Actually, there is nothing like that
 garbh main palane vaale bachche ke nain-naksh jin par nirbhar karte hai
 Yes, as far as putting the picture of a beautiful child in front of the eyes is concerned, it is good that the pregnant woman feels good by seeing the good picture and it is very important to be happy in such a situation
 myth-2
 By drinking coconut water after the seventh month, the child's brain becomes as big as coconut
 vaastaviktaa-ye baat saraasar galat he
 Wondering where this thing came from
 darasal, nariyal ke pani main potacium bharpoor hota he, lekin wo kisi bhi tarah se mastishk ke aakaar ke liye jimmedaar nahin hota he
 Myth-3
 subah kaa pehla niwala safed khaanaa chahie
 This gives the child a fair complexion
 vaastaviktaa-ye bhi apane aap main ek bahut hi bada myth he
 As we have already said that the appearance of the fetus depends on the genes, whether you eat white or black does not affect the color of the baby
 myth-4
 During eclipse the pregnant woman should hide and avoid any kind of activity
 vaastaviktaa-garbhavastha ke dauraan mahilaon ko grahan ke dauraan kamare main chupchaap baith jane kii salaah di jaati he
 But the point to think is that eclipse is a definite process and it has no effect on the child's birth
 haalanki, iskaa matlab ye bilkul nahin he ki grahan ko beparwaah hokar nangi ankhon se dekha jaae lekin, ye baat keval garbhvatee mahilaon ke liye nahin balki sabhi ke liye lagu hoti he
 Myth-5
 garbh ke aakaar se bachche kaa ling pataa chal jaataa he
 Reality - This is also a very interesting myth in itself
 garbh kaa aakaar, garbh main bachche kii pojishan ke bare main bataata he
 The size of the womb has no connection with the sex of the baby
 myth-6
 The gender of the mother reveals the sex of the child
 vaastaviktaa-darasal, garbhvatee kii rangath puri tarah uske hormones par nirbhar karti he
 During pregnancy, there is a lot of change in the hormones of women, due to which the color of some women is improved, some become dark and there are others, which have spots on their face
 isse bachche kaa ling bataa dena vaaki myth hi he
 Myth-7
 ghi, makkhan or tel kaa adhik seven karne se bachche kaa janm aaraam se ho jaataa he
 Reality - There is nothing like that
 ghi, makkhan bachche ke janm ko aaramdaayak banane main madadgaar nahin hote hai
 Rather, excessive intake of these leads to a very high calorie intake in the body and once a child is born, it becomes very difficult to reduce it
 myth-8
 a pregnant woman should eat twice her regular diet as she has to eat not only for herself but also for the child
 vaastaviktaa-ye shaayad sabase saamaanya myth he, lekin puri tarah se sach nahin
 Admittedly, your child gets nutrition from you, but this does not mean that you take twice as much of your diet
 garbhvatee mahila ko apane dainik aahaar main 300 calories kaa ijapha karnaa chahie or koshish kerani chahie ki wo taileey khaane ke bajaay zyada se zyada paushtik aahaar le

 While in the pleasant month of Saavan, the whole of North India enjoys lush greenery everywhere amidst the ravines of the drops and the cloudy eyes of Michauli, but during this time in the Purvanchal region of Uttar Pradesh, there is a different shade of Saavan with the echo of Bhojpuri folklore
 Appears
 purvanchal main is puure maah ko ek tyohaar ke rup main manaaya jaataa he or jahaan khet, khalihaan or baag bagichon main hariyaali chhaayi rahati he
 At the same time, Bhojpuri folk songs are sung from village to village, taking a strange enthusiasm in everyone's mind
 sawan maheene main padane vaali naag panchami ke din to ek khaas utsaah puure purvachal par chaaya rahata he or khaskar yuvatiyon or navvivaahita ladkiyaan jhund banaakar pedo kii daalon par pade jhulon ke unche hulaare leti hui apni sakhiyon ke sang bhojpuri loakgeet gaati hai
 The songs sung with the swing of Saavan are full of songs of coincidence and disconnection, as well as references to Radha Krishna are also found in these songs
 is maah main suhagan apane priy ko apane aasapaas hi chaahati he or use sawan kaa maheenaa apane priy ke bina acha nahi lagata
 
 ’’ hamake naa bhaave ho sawan bina sajanavaa ho nanadi’’
 
 
 So, there are beautiful girls swinging on the swings, "the songs of" Jhoola Jhule Jhule Banwari Hey Goiya "and" Gheri gheri aayi gati kari kari sakhiya "in Radha Sang dissolve the nectar juice in the ears
 aaj kii aadhuniktaavaadi, bhagdaud or shahari samskruti main ye pracheen paramparaayen kam zarur ho rahi he, parantu aaj bhi purvanchal ke gaanvon main iskaa vishesh mahatv he
 It is celebrated as a cultural festival on the day of Nagpanchami and the swinging process lasts for a month and in the villages, women wear colorful dresses and adorn the kajari while swinging
 mahilaon kaa jhund bagaiyr kisi taiyaari ke raat bhar naatak nautanki bhi karti hai or jab vah ek sur main geet gaati he to puure maahaul main ek ajeeb si masti raat ke sannaate ko todatii hui har kisi ke man main gudagudi paidaa kar detii he
 Economic slowdown is going on around the world including India
 is maahaul main duniyabar main sone kii keemat main bhi teji dekhne ko mil rahi he
 If we talk about India, then the price of gold is close to 39 thousand rupees per ten grams
 beete guuruuvaar ko dilli sarrapha bazaar main sone kaa bhav 150 rupee kii teji ke saath 38,970 rupee kii nai oonchai ko chhu gaya
 This is the most expensive price ever
 isi tarah chaandi kii keemat ne bhi 45 hajaar prati kilogram ke bhav ko paar kar liya he
 In such a situation, the question of why the demand for gold is increasing in the state of economic slowdown
 aaie jaanate hai puure maamle ko
 
 kyon badhati he keemtadarasal, sone ko surakshit nivesh kaa sabase behatar saadhan mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, whenever investors do not like the economic conditions, then they give priority to gold investment
 iskaa nateeja ye hota he ki sone kii demand bad jaati he
 The price increases due to increased demand for gold
 iske alaava gharelu bazaar main kharidari zyada hoti he, tab bhi sone ke bhav main teji aati he
 Gold buying increases especially in the festive season
 vahiin sarkaar kii nitiyon or faislon kaa bhi sone ke bhav par asar padataa he
 Why is gold becoming expensive in India 1
 bharat main sone ke bhav badhane ke kai kaaran hai
 The first biggest reason is the government's decision on gold in the general budget
 darasal, beete july maheene main aam bajet pesh karte hue pradhanmantri narendra modi kii sarkaar ne gold par aayaat shulk ko 10 fisadi se badhaakar 12
 5 percent tax
 aayaat shulk badhane kii vajah se gold kaa kaarobaar teji se gata he
 Explain that India is a major importer of gold
 yah apni jarurat kaa zyada hissaa aayaat karata he
 2
 sone ke bhav main teji kii duusari sabase badi vajah arabiai dwaara lagaataar repo rate main kii ja rahi katautee he
 Although the reduction in the repo rate directly benefits the common people, but indirectly the increase in the price of gold is also due to this reason
 darasal, repo rate main katautee kaa matlab he ki bank ab arabiai se zyada aasaani se lone le paaenge
 After this, the flow of money will increase in banks
 phir bank bazaar main lone degaa
 In this whole process, the flow of money will increase
 iskaa nateeja ye hoga ki sansthaaen or aam log apane paison kaa nivesh sona kharidne kii ore karenge
 This will increase both demand and price of gold
 3
 If except two-four days, the health of the Indian stock market is deteriorating since the general budget
 beete may maheene main loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon ke baad 40 hajaar ke aankade ko paar karne vaala sensex maujuuda vakt main 37 hajaar ke neeche kaarobaar kar rahaa he

 In the recent past, many influential people of the Narendra Modi government and cinema have been seen together
 south mumbai main bhi narendra modi ne film divijan property par film musium kaa udghaatan kiya tha or kai bollywood stars piem modi ke saath tasviir khinchvaate hue nazar aae the
 In his first term Modi made some announcements for the cinema industry
 cinema industry is saal bhi modi sarkaar se kuch raahat kii ummid main he
 Needless to say that the film industry has been a very leading sector in terms of employment
 kansaltensi deloit ke mutabik saal 2017 main bhartiya film industry ne 2 lakh 50 hazaar logon ko rojgaar diya tha vahiin chaar saal pehle ye sankhya mahaj 160,800 thi
 This is the reason why the government is also excited by the growth of this industry
 piresi ko khatm karne ke liye bhi modi sarkaar ne cinematograph act main anti camecording provizine kii shuruuaat kii he
 India every year 2
 5 billian dollars online piresi ke chalate ganvaa detaa he
 This amount is very large in Indian rupees
 har saal desh ke kai film nirmaataaon kii kamai par piresi ke chalate fark padataa he
 With the help of anti camcorder, piracy will be tried
 haalanki ye kadam kitna kargar sabit hoga, ye aane vaala vakt hi batayega
 Nirahua @ jadooz a cinema pic in every tehsil
 twitter
 com / yf1qpgki0q — Nirahua Hindustani (@ nirahua1) June 27, 2019 The Modi government in its first term launched another important concept for Indian filmmakers
 farvari main antarim bajet main single windo clearence kii ghoshnaa karte hue piyush goyal ne kaha tha ki single windo clearence pehle sirf videshi filmmekars ko hi uplabdh tha
 But now it will also be available for Indian filmmakers
 isse filmmekars ko deshbhar main shooting ko lekar jagah-jagah parmishan lene kii jarurat nahin padegi or sabhi paperwork ko ek final athurity se parmishan lene ke baad shooting shuru kii ja sakegi
 This will save a lot of time and energy for the filmmakers and will reduce the hassles in making films
 multiplex culture ke aane ke baad se hi middle class or loar middle class tikaton kii keemton par har baar sawaal uthaata aayaa he
 The government had reduced 18 per cent GST to 12 per cent on tickets above Rs 100
 vahiin 100 se kam tikat par lagane vaale 28 pratishat jiesti ko 18 pratishat kar diya tha
 However, people associated with the film industry are not too happy with this
 industry sarkaar se or riyaayat kii ummid kar rahi he
 In the last few years, regional films have been suffering a lot since multiplex culture flourished and single-screen theaters reached the brink
 bollywood hi nahin balki bhojpuri, punjabi or duusari bhartiya bhashaaon ke kai chote cinema bazaar cinemagharon kii killat kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, there are some things like focus on single screen theaters which can help to grow regional cinema
 azamgarh se chunaav ladane vaale bhojpuri actor nirahua ne is sambandh main pahal bhi shuru kar chuke hai
 He recently joined a program in Lucknow with the focus of a cinema in Har Tehsil
 nirahua is program ke sahare bhojpuri filmon ke liye apane rajya main har tehsil main single screen cinema ko launch karne kii koshish main he
 Having a government in the party can yield good results for his effort
 har ilaake main theatres kii kami se film nirmaan or uske vitaran main ek acha kaarobaar fal phool saktaa he
 The government should also take initiative in this regard
 taaki screens par bade bajet kii filmon kaa ekadhikaar khatm ho
 If there is a facility for screens, then small budget and regional language films will get the market
 jaahir si baat he ki filmon ke nirmaan main teji aegi or ek cinema ek vyapak darshak varg tak pahonchega
 Everyone will benefit from this in India

 In 2015, Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi seems to have taken a new avatar
 ve khud ko ek aise shaks ke taur par sthapit karne kii koshish main lag gaye hai jo aatmanirbhar or jujharu he
 On 6 January, Manjhi transferred 18 IAS officers of the state in a jolt and put Dalit officers in decisive positions, bypassing almost all bureaucrats considered to be the favorites of former Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 is faisle se aisa laga ki maanjhi ne bahujan samaaj party kii mukhiya mayawati se kuch prashasnic sabak liye hai
 Whenever Mayawati came to power in Uttar Pradesh, she worked to place Dalit officers in important positions
 yah prashasnic pherbadal haalanki maanjhi kii vyapak yojana kii ek choti-si shuruyaat bhar tha
 Manjhi, who till now has been considered trusted by Nitish Kumar, also welcomed the decision of the Patna High Court on 7 January in which the Speaker of the assembly Speaker's decision to withdraw the membership of the four rebel JD (U) mlas who stood against Nitish was rejected
 Had done it
 is faisle ko rajnatik halkon main nitish ke pratikul mana ja rahaa he or iskaa swaagat kar ke maanjhi ne na sirf apni party kii aadhikarik line ko todaa he balki aisa kar ke unhone party main nitish virdohi kuch vidhayakon kaa bharosa bhi jeet liya he
 Whereas before this, Manjhi was considered to be an obedient pawn or even a puppet
 loksabhaa chunaav main jedy (you) ko lage tagade jatke ke baad nitish kumaar ko shahadat kaa chola olyuya padaa or natijatan may 2014 main maanjhi mukhyamantri kii kursi par baitha die gaye the
 From then until the end of last year, the new Chief Minister Manjhi was largely seen as an obedient servant
 nitish kumaar kii ore se tay kiye gaye prashasnic lakshyon kii disha main kaam karte hue maanjhi ko 2014 main nitish ke daur ke naukarshahon ke saath kaam karne main koi harj nahin mahasoos hua or ve kaaphi santusht bhi dikhte the
 a senior JD (U) leader says, "manjhi has never publicly said a word against Nitish Kumar
 lekin is faisle par unka paksh saaf dikhaata he ki ve hameshaa ke liye mukhyamantri ke taj par kabja jamaa lene kii firaaq main hai
 "manjhi has emerged today as a leader who is not only considering her role as limited to the Bihar Assembly elections, but she is also monitoring her wider role
 bhale hi jedy (you) ke bheetar kai log unase simit rahane kii hi apeksha rakhte hon
 The question arises that why did Manjhi suddenly change the maneuver? The reason for this can apparently be seen in the timing
 is baat kii majboot atakalein hai ki puraane janata parivaar ke dalon ke paraspar vilay ke baad maanjhi ko mukhyamantri pad se hataa diya jayega kyonki nitish kumaar or argedy pramukh lalu prasad yadav, donon hi is baat par sahamat hai ki rajya main bijepi ko rokane main maanjhi na to rajnatik taur par bahut majboot hai or na hi prashasnic str par ve bahut vishwasaneey hai
 The merger of the Janata Parivar of the six parties seems almost certain, though there are still some procedural formalities
 jaise ki nae dal ke chunaav chinh par ab tak sahmati nahin ban saki he
 Even if it takes some more time, the JD (U) and RJD have established working unity in Bihar and both have joined together for the assembly elections
 rajya ke vidhansabha chunaavon main ab jabaki saal bhar se bhi kam vakt bachaa he, lalu yadav or nitish, donon hi netaa vilay ke baad sarkaar ke netritv ke sawaal par manthan kar rahe hai
 It is being thought that more votes will come from the removal of Manjhi or by retaining him
 donon netaa is baat par bhi sahamat hai ki bijepi ko haraane ke liye unhen apni sarvshereshth niti saamne rakhni hogi
 There seems to be agreement that Nitish Kumar should return to the post of Chief Minister in the government formed after the merger of the two parties and Lalu Yadav's daughter Misa Bharti should be given the senior minister's post
 party ke sutara bataate hai ki lalu yadav ne nitish ko yah salaah di he ki ve rajya kii kaman maanjhi se apane haath main le len, haalanki nitish kumaar is vichaar ko lekar satark hai
 They feel that the BJP will make a lot of hue and cry over this move
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki maanjhi ko rijhaane ke liye bijepi lalu yadav or nitish kumaar par ek mahadalit ko hataane kaa aarope laga de
 It is being said that Nitish has expressed hesitation about this, though he has not completely rejected the idea
 35 varsh kaa siyaasi tajurba rakhane vaale maanjhi nai hawaaon ko bhaanp rahe hai
 Now they are trying to protect themselves by playing dalit cards aggressively
 jedy (you ) ke ek netaa kaa kahana he, “maanjhi ko hataanaa minuton kaa kaam he
 It is up to Nitish Kumar which day they take the decision, but Manjhi's attitude shows that Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar will have to pay some political cost in order to remove them
 bade uhapoh kii sthiti he
 The longer Manjhi stays in the chair, the more marginalized Nitish Kumar will be in power in Bihar
 lekin agar maanjhi ko hataa diya gaya to jedy (you ) ke liye yah sunishchit karnaa utana hi mushkil ho jayega ki use dalit virdohi ke taur par na dekha jaae
 "manjhi is the third Dalit Chief Minister of Bihar after Bhola Paswan Shastri and Ram Sundar Das and he clearly has a 22 per cent Dalit population in the state
 bihar main 22 dalit jatiyaan hai or paswan jati ke alaava baaki sabhi ko mahadalit kii shrenee main daal diya gaya he
 Paswan is around five per cent of the state's population and is considered loyal to Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan
 lihaaja maanjhi kii najar baaki 17 fisadi daliton par he
 Apart from giving important posts to Dalit officers, Manjhi has also addressed a meeting of more than 300 SC / ST officials up to IAS level
 yah kaaphi chaturaai bharaa kadam tha kyonki sarkari adhikari jis samudaay se aate hai, ve uske nazariye ko mote taur par prabhavit bhi karte hai
 It is being said that Manjhi is going to review the dismissal and suspension of more than 250 SC / ST employees who were judged during Nitish Kumar's tenure
 inamen clerk se lekar atirikt jila magistrate str tak ke karmchaaree shaamil hai
 Manjhi admits that after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when he got into political turmoil in the state, he had crossed the boat of JD (U) government
 haal hi main unhone kaha tha, “aakhirkaar ek maanjhi hi bich sagar main jahaaj ko doobane se bachaa saktaa he
 "manjhi has removed the grievances of many disgruntled mlas and has done them in his court, which even Nitish Kumar could not do
 mukhyamantri ne rajya ke mukhya sachiv or dijipi ko nirdesh diya ki ve sabhi jiladhikariyon or police adhikshakon ko patr likhakar kahen ki ve vidhayakon ke apane daftaron main pahunchane par unhen samuchit sammaan den or unka swaagat karne ke liye khadey rahen
 On the other hand, during Nitish Kumar's tenure, there was a common complaint of legislators and members of the Legislative Council that the bureaucracy has been given a free hand and the District Magistrate and Superintendent of Police are neglecting the legislators
 iske thik ulat maanjhi vidhayakon ke maamle main paryaapt samaveshi sabit hue hai
 However, there is another major obstacle in front of Manjhi
 pichley 20 varsh se ek-duusare ke khilaaf siyaasi talavaarein bhaanjte rahe lalu yadav or nitish kumaar kaa saath aana rajya ke siyaasi paridrishy main ek aitihaasik badlaav kaa suchak he
 These two leaders are undeniably the two faces of the JP movement that have reached the pinnacle of politics
 agar aaj akkhad lekin teevr rajnatik soch vaale lalu or chatur tathaa vakpatu nitish kumaar keval bijepi ke tufaan ko rokane or apana vajood bachaane ke liye aapas main haath mila rahe hai to jaahir he, netritv main kisi or ke aane kii gunjaaish apane aap khatm ho jaati he
 In such a situation Manjhi will have to go tomorrow if not today
 loksabhaa chunaav main jedy (you) kii karaari haar ke baad jis maanjhi ko apni kursi par nitish kumaar ne baitaane ke liye chunaa tha, unase nitish pehle se hi niraash chal rahe hai
 His disappointment was evident when reporters asked him whether he believed Manjhi would continue as the chief minister till November
 Nitish Kumar answered this with a question, "who am i (commentator)?" This question is the most accurate answer to Manjhi's fate
