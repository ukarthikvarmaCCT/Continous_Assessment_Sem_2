 ) trinmul congress (TMC) saansad kalyaan banerjee ne mangalvaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara prastaavit vichaar par bhartiya janata party shasit rajyon main sansadeey chunaav ke saath vidhansabha chunaav karaane kii baat kahi
 Taking part in the discussion on the motion of thanks on the President's address to the Lok Sabha, Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee said that the idea is unrealistic and against the Constitution
 unhone pradhanmantri ko pehle bijepi shasit rajyon jaise gujarat, assam va uttar pradesh main ek saath loksabhaa va vidhansabha chunaav karaane kii chunauti di
 Kalyan Banerjee sought to know why Prime Minister Modi is repeatedly talking about a subject which the Parliamentary Committee has for examination
 unhone iskaa ullekh raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan main karne ke liye bhi sarkaar kii ninda kii
 He said, "why are we being stressed for holding elections together, when the subject is with the Standing Committee for investigation
" kaise pradhanmantri is vishay par har jagah baat kar rahe hai
 "he cited a hypothetical position in support of his talk, in which a coalition government collapses after a year
 samvidhan ke buniyadi dhaanche ko nuksaanaunhone kaha, "maan lijie 2019 main sabhi chunaav saath karaae gaye or sattarudh dal ko bahumat hasil nahin hua
 If one year after the other parties withdrew support from the government and the government collapsed, will all the states hold elections again? ”the Trinamool Congress MP said the move would damage the infrastructure of the constitution
 pehle bijepi shasit rajyon main ho chunaavaunhone kaha ki jab sthaayee samiti maamle ko dekh rahi he to us par tippanee karne se bachanaa chahie
 How did it become part of the President's address? Let elections be held in all the bjp-ruled states first
 unhen (modi) aisa karne den
 Let us show the spirit of holding elections together
 paroapkaar ghar se shuru hota he
 Lalu Prasad Yadav and Nitish Kumar coming together in Bihar is a compulsion because it is necessary for the survival of both
 unhen pataa he ki yadi saath nahin aae to shaayad kahin ke na rahen
 The BJP is in power at the Center, the Bihar election will be a prestige question for Modi and Amit Shah
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi apni puri takat bihar chunaav main jhokegi
 Even they are not going to pay the price, the punishment
 bihar chunaav kaa itnaa mahatv he ki sarkaar ne kavi ramdhaari singh dinakar par dilli main ek bade kaarykram kaa bhi aayojan kiya
 The strategy behind this move of BJP is very clear
 vah ek bhi vot khone ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 Even though the percentage of the particular caste Dinkar comes from may be low, but this caste proves very effective in creating special election environment
 bihar main savarna jatiyon ko majaak main laudispikar jati bhi kehete hai, kyonki ye maahaul banane main kargar hai
 They can sustain an issue from every tea-shop to the media for a long time
 bijepi nishchit taur par in agadi jatiyon se yahi ummid rakhti he
 The BJP has its own vote as well as the Kushwaha vote and Ram Vilas Paswan's Dalit vote
 bijepi bihar main bhi uttar pradesh model apnaane kii koshish main he ki agadon ke saath daliton ko joda jaae
 Because of this, Mayawati ended in the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh
 yahi nahin bijepi jithan ram maanjhi or pappu yadav par bhi najar rakhe hue he
 If there is no coordination with them, BJP will want Manjhi to field a lot of candidates so that the contest becomes complicated
 iske liye bijepi maanjhi ko fund bhi karegi taaki maanjhi or pappu yadav bhi bihar chunaav ke dauraan helicopter main ghumen
 This is the reason that whenever Manjhi asks for time from the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister does not waste time in giving him time
 bhai naak kaa sawaal he bihar chunaav
 
 
 Now such a big siege convinced Lalu and Nitish when they came together
 lalu yadav kii party ke kuch netaaon ke lagaataar bayanon se naaraaz or niraash ho chuke nitish kumaar ne congress se yah bayaan dilava diya ki vah niteesha ke saath jaaengen
 This is why Nitish Kumar went to meet Rahul Gandhi before meeting Lalu in Delhi
 nitish ke is kadam se lalu yadav par bhi dabaab badha he
 If Lalu and Nitish come together, there will be no doubt among the Muslims
 bihar main muslim or yadav akele 30 fisadi kaa aankada paar kar jate hai or donon sau fisadi poling bhi karte hai
 The comments magar argedy or jediu gathbandhan yaa vilay ke baad koun kitni siten legaa, is par vivaad badhegaa
 Lalu Yadav has only 24 mlas and is seeking 144 seats
 lalu khud chunaav nahin lard sakate, magar unhen apane puure parivaar ko set karnaa he
 Lalu is also demanding so many seats that Nitish's people should be less when the time comes to elect a leader after the election
 agar vilay hota he to koi dikkat nahin hogi, kyonki donon party ke samay main ek hi thi
 Bihar has nothing to lose for the Congress
 aise main acha hoga lalu niteesha kii party kaa vilay ho jaae or netaa kaa faisla chunaav ke baad kiya jaae
 Lalu is trying to put another hitch, he is pressurizing Nitish Kumar to take Manjhi along
 udhar maanjhi chaahate hai ki unhen mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar banaaya jaae
 In these circumstances, the next two months will be important for the future of Lalu and Nitish as well as BJP and Bihar
 bijepi centre main satta main he, bihar chunaav modi or amit shah ke liye ek pratishtha kaa sawaal hoga
 This is the reason that BJP will give its full strength in Bihar elections
 yahaan tak ki ve sam- daam, dand- bhed kisi se nahin chukne vaali he
 The Bihar election is so important that the government also organized a big program in Delhi on poet Ramdhari Singh Dinkar
 bijepi kii is chaal ke peeche kii ranneeti ekadam saaf he
 He is not ready to lose a single vote
 dinakar jis jati vishesh se aate hai, unka pratishat bhale hi kam ho, magar yah jati vishesh chunaav ke maahaul banane main bahut kargar sabit hota he
 In Bihar, the upper castes are also jokingly called the loudspeaker caste, because they are effective in creating atmosphere
 ye har chaay paan kii dukaan se lekar media tak main kisi mudde ko lambey samay tak kaayam rakh sakate hai
 The BJP certainly expects the same from these forward castes
 bijepi ke paas apane vot ke saath-saath kushvaha vot bhi he or ramvilas paswan kaa dalit vot bhi
 The BJP is also trying to adopt the Uttar Pradesh model in Bihar to connect Dalits with the Forward
 isi kii vajah se uttar pradesh main mayawati loksabhaa chunaav main khatm ho gai thi
 Not only this, BJP is also keeping an eye on Jitan Ram Manjhi and Pappu Yadav
 inase koi talmail nahin hota he to bijepi chaahegi ki maanjhi dheron ummidavaar khadey karen, taaki muqabla pechida ho jaae
 For this, BJP will also fund Manjhi so that Manjhi and Pappu Yadav also roam in a helicopter during Bihar elections
 yahi vajah he ki maanjhi jab bhi pradhanmantri se vakt maangate hai, pradhanmantri unhen samay dene main vakt nahin ganvaate
 Bihar election is the question of brother's nose
 
 
 ab itani badi gheraabandi ne lalu or nitish ko saath aane par manjabur kar diya
 Nitish Kumar, annoyed and frustrated by the frequent statements of some leaders of Lalu Yadav's party, got the Congress to make a statement that he would go with Nitish
 yahi vajah he ki dilli main lalu se milane ke pehle niteesha kumaar rahul gandhi se milane gaye
 Nitish's move has also increased pressure on Lalu Yadav
 agar lalu or nitish saath aae to muslimon main koi sanshay kii sthiti nahin rahegi
 In Bihar, Muslims and Yadavs alone cross the 30 per cent mark and both also do 100 per cent polling
 tippaniyan But after RJD and JDU alliance or merger, dispute will increase on who will take so many seats
 lalu yadav ke paas sirf 24 vidhayak hai or vah 144 siten maang rahe hai
 Lalu cannot contest elections himself, but he has to set up his entire family
 lalu itani siten isliye bhi maang rahe hai ki chunaav ke baad jab netaa chunane kaa vakt aae to nitish ke log kam hon
 If there is a merger then there will be no problem, because both parties had only one at the time
 congress ke liye to bihar main kuch khone ke liye nahin he
 In such a situation, it would be good for Lalu Nitish's party to be merged and the leader should be decided after the election
 lalu ek or aadchan daalane main lage hai, vah nitish kumaar par maanjhi ko saath lekar chalane ke liye dabaab bana rahe hai
 On the other hand, Manjhi wants to make him the candidate of the Chief Minister
 in halaat main agle do maheene lalu or nitish ke bhavishya ke saath hi bijepi or bihar ke liye bhi ahm honge

 Today is Sarkarotsav
 sarkarotsav us utsav ko kehete hai ki jab sarkaar apane ek saal puure karti he
 The tradition of celebrating the sarkarots probably began in America when President Roosevelt celebrated 100 days of his government
 roosevelt 1932 main raashtrapati bane the
 This tradition followed in India too, but after 100 days, governments do not celebrate 200 days, they directly celebrate the anniversary
 sarkarotsav manaane ke liye akhbaaron main phul pej ke vigyaapan chhapate hai, un vigyapanon main bade-bade daawey kiye jate hai, ghoshnaaen hoti hai, udghaatan hote hai or nae nae slogan hote hai
 In the morning, these printed achievements are tweeted by all ministers, leaders, general secretaries and party spokespersons appearing in TV
 itnaa kuch hua hota he ki samaj nahin aata ki kya kya nahin hua hoga
 May 26, 2014, is the day when Prime Minister Modi took the oath of office and secrecy but on this day the government celebrates its anniversary
 yah teesraa saal he
 For two years, the central government was celebrating the government alone, but this time the pattern has changed
 rajya sarkaron ne dilli ke akhbaaron main vigyaapan dekar sarkarotsav kii badhaaiyaan bheji hai or balaaiyaan lee hai
 State governments also celebrate their anniversaries, but now they are also happily carrying the weight of the anniversary of the center
 sawaal yah he ki jab dilli kaa media jharkhand ko agency ke bharose cover karata he, news channel to jharkhand ko speed news main hi nipta dete hai to jharkhand ke mukhyamantri us rajya kii janata ke paise se magar mukhyamantri ke faisle se dilli ke akhbaaron main vigyaapan chhapana kitna uchit he
 Slogan is in English, on way to new india means Jharkhand is on the way to new India
 madhyapradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kaa vigyaapan bhi acha he magar sankochi he
 The government has written down that the Raja Bhoj Setu will be inaugurated, it seems that care has been taken that the inauguration of this bridge should not fall on the inauguration of the country's largest bridge in Assam, where the Prime Minister visited
 Huh
 rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne apane vigyapanon main centre kii sarkaar kii uplabdhiyaan ginai hai magar usee paise main apni sarkaar kii kamyaabi ginanaa nahin bhuuli hai
 He has given half the space to Modi ji, half the space to his government
 in teenon vigyapanon main vasundhara ji hi zyaada confident lag rahi hai, agar donon mukhyamantri meri baat kaa bura na maane to
 In the government of Yogi ji of UP, there is a feeling of subordination and sanity
 upi kaa vigyaapan bhi aadhe panne kaa he
 Yogi ji knows that if he can outweigh these three Chief Ministers, then what place should be included in the advertisement
 kya bharat kaa media samaaj dilli main rahata he, jiske akhabaaron main rajyon kii sarkarein vigyaapan detii rahati hai
 Kerala government advertisements come in such a way that all the CPM voters live here
 ab to urisa sarkaar ke vigyaapan bhi aane lage hai
 If the country is not seen in Delhi, it might not be visible
 aneve, hamane sochaa ki is okeshan par aalochanatmak badlaav karte hai, ye wo badlaav he jo nakaaratmak or sakaaratmak badlaav se kaaphi alag he
 Now see, throughout the year people keep asking that there is no opposition in India
 dilli main 16 vipakshi partiyon ke mukhyamantri, netaa jamaa hue
 Opposition in Delhi is also seen as if bjp-ruled states have sent their advertisements in Delhi newspapers
 phir bhi vipaksh ko khojane vaale dekh sakate hai ki netaaon kii khaas kami nahin he, asal baat yah he ki aaj kaa media vipaksh virdohi media he
 Gives space to the opposition and then questions where the opposition is
 sanyog hi he ki jis din vipaksh ke itane netaa dilli aae, usee din pradhananmatri dilli se dur chale gaye
 Is it not that if the opposition comes to Delhi, the Prime Minister goes to Assam or the Prime Minister goes to Assam, the opposition is gathered in Delhi
 vaise raajnneeti ko rahasy or rachana kii tarah dekhiye, aapako iske kisse romanchit karenge
 Today is Sarkarotsav
 centre sarkaar ke kai mantri alag-alag dishaao main sarkaar kii kamyaabi kaa sandesh lekar ja rahe hai
 On this occasion, ministers have organized various programs
 kai kaaryakramon kii frenchizi jaisi khul gai he
 For example, Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu has discussed at a village panchayat level in a village in Rajasthan
 jo ki chaay par charchaa or khaat par charchaa se kaaphi alag he
 As soon as i remembered the discussion on the bed, nothing was remembered
 isi maukey par main vijay goyal ji kaa dhanyavad karnaa chahta hum
 He has discovered a new type of youth
 slam yuva
 Slum youth is the youth who lives in slums
 isse pataa chalata he ki abhi tak jo yuva the saaf nahin tha ki ve slam yuva hai yaa posh yuva hai
 An analysis of the posters released on Twitter suggests that youth can be identified based on where they reside, apart from age
 is kaarykram kaa naam he slam yuva daud
 Adopt a slum means adopt a slum of Delhi
 isse yah saaf nahin he ki dilli ke ek slam ko koi god kaise le saktaa he, saansad god legaa, vidhayak god legaa yaa ye yuva hi apane slam ko god le lenge jisaki god main ye palate badhate hai
 However, under the auspices of Nehru Yuva Kendra, there was a race of slum youth, the crowd was considerable, the T-shirt also had a slum youth race
 sab kuch hindi main tha sirf slam angrezi main dikhaa
 Slum people could write
 in tasveeron se pataa chalata he ki hamaare slam yuva bhi dakshin dilli kii posh coloniyon main palane vaale yuvaaon jaise hi dikhte hai
 Nevertheless, this was a new idea and a good idea, if there is a shortage, Vijay Goyal is a liberal minister, he will improve
 slam god lene kii prerana shaayad adarsh gram yojana se lee gai hogi
 It was announced in October 2014 that every MP would adopt a village and make it ideal
 bhaajapa ke 281 saansad hai, us hisaab se teen saal baad 282 gaanvon ko adarsh rup main pesh kiya hi ja saktaa tha
 Seems like no one wants to talk to him anymore
 bat aneve
 If you want to shift from the original thing, then use butt anive in English
 kya aapane railway stesan par kursiyaan dekhi hai
 There are so few, more people keep staring at sitting than when they are not sitting, when we get up to sit
 samachar agency pitiai ne jab ye tasviir jari kii ki saansad hemamalini ne mathura railway stesan par kursiyon kaa udghaatan kiya he
 Seeing the picture, it would have been inaugurated, but saw it for the first time
 lekin jab hamane pataa kiya to hema malini ne acha kaam kiya he
 Mathura railway station is such a busy station
 kisi kaa dhyaan hi nahin gaya ki yatriyon ke baithne kii vyavastha honi chahie
 The pillars had a round seating system at the sides but Hema Malini has replaced it
 unhone vahaan par apane saansad nidhi se 100 bench lagava di he
 There are 40 benches on platform number one, 40 benches on platform number two and three and twenty benches on the rest
 abhi tak ham samajhate the ki railway hi stesan par bench kii vyavastha karti hogi, magar saansad nidhi kaa yah acha istemaal he
 The government is full of claims of its achievements, the opposition says that nothing has happened
 camel nishaan vaali bhaajapa ke netaa ek taraf uplabdhiyon ko lekar twitor se lekar bargad ke neeche khadey nazar aae to congress kii taraf se camel naam vaale kamalnath ne ginanaa shuru kar diya he ki 35 kisaan rose aatm hatya kar rahe hai
 Employment is at its lowest level in 7 years
 raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne guuruuvaar ko rajdhani dilli main yojit ramnath goyanka vyaakhyaan maala main phek news ke bare main chintaa jataai
 Said that the media's job is to question the government
 media apana mul kaam nahin kar rahaa he to log khush ho gaye hai ki raashtrapati ne ishaaron ishaaron main pradhanmantri or unki sarkaar par kataaksh kar diya he
 But in the Rashtrapati Bhavan on the day of Sarkarotsav, when the President released a book on Mann Ki Baat, the President also praised the communication skills communication skill of the Prime Minister
 kuch din pehle raashtrapati ne yah bhi kaha tha ki bhartiya itihaas kii indira gandhi sabase sweekrut pradhanmantri hai
 The Prime Minister is referring to Modi as an effective communicator and can also be compared to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi
 isi kaarykram ke dauraan raksha mantri or vitt mantri arun jetali ne bayaan diya ki pichley kuch saal se radio pichhadta ja rahaa tha lekin piem modi ne ek madhyam ke rup main radio kii takat ko pahachaanaa
 It is right to recognize the strength, but there may be different opinions about the fact that radio was lagging behind for the last few years
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki man kii baat ek anokhaa kaarykram he
 It is the first radio program that also appears on TV at the same time
 tivi par hi nahin, dilli main hi yah saare privet efem channelon par bhi aata he
 Whenever Mann Ki Baat is announced, no other program comes on any radio channel
 man kii baat kaa prasaaran doordarshan par bhi hota he
 Therefore, government TV, private channels, private FM channels should also be included in the analysis of the impact of Mann Ki Baat
 kya kisi or ke kaarykram ko efem channel apana kaarykram band kar suna sakate hai
 Yes, it can be said that the Prime Minister has changed TV to radio during Mann Ki Baat
 radio ke vikaas ke bare main fikki kepiemji apni salanaa report main jaankaree detii he
 The 2013 FICCI KPMG report stated that Radio 16 between 2012 and 2017
 6 pratishat kii growth rate se badhegaa
 The 2017 FICCI KPMG report stated that radio in 2016 had 14
 5 pratishat ke hisaab se hi growth rate hasil kii
 That is, the growth rate was lower by about two percent
 is vakt bharat ke 86 shaharon main 243 nijee radio channel chal rahe hai
 The radio sector was privatized in 2000, several hundred channels have been auctioned but only 243 are in operation
 fikki kepiemji kii report kahati he ki tisare charan kii nilaamee ko lekar khaasaa utsaah nahin dikhaa he
 Radios are also of many types
 digital radio, community radio
 Their progress should also be seen
 ab zaraa rajasav kaa angel dekh lete hai
 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) report of 15 March 2016 states that in 2014 the revenue of the radio sector grew by 18 percent compared to 2013, its revenue is expected to increase by 18 percent by 2019
 man kii baat se kamai or vigyaapan se hue kharche ko lekar hamaare paas koi swatantra jaankaree nahin he
 But we have got two news related to this in the archive of internet
 9 disambar 2016 ke live mint main chapa he ki loksabhaa main mantri rajyavardhan rathore ne likhit jawaab diya he ki 2015-16 main man kii baat se jo rajasav aayaa he wo 4 karod 78 lakh he
 RTI was quoted in Indian Express of August 5, 2015 as saying that only newspapers have spent eight and a half crores on advertisement of Mann Ki Baat
 aapane dekha ki rajasav aayaa 4 karod 78 lakh, vigyaapan par kharch hua kareeb dugana saadhe aath karod
 Live Mint has quoted sources as saying that more advertisements of Mann Ki Baat come from government advertisements
 loksabhaa main likhit jawaab dete hue mantri rajyavardhan rathod ne bataaya tha ki ol india radio kaa rajasav 2014-15 main 435
 1 crore
 2015-16 main 447
 6 crores
 to rajasav ke hisaab se bhi dekhiye to rajasav main maatr 12 karod 66 lakh kii vruddhi hui he
 There is no denying that radio has evolved
 hua he lekin man kii baat se kitna hua he kahana mushkil he
 Yes, Mann Ki Baat has been affected
 isse prabhavit hokar chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri ne bhi man kii baat jaisaa kaarykram karte hai
 Among the leaders of the opposition, Congress's Sandeep Dixit has started talking about work rather than Mann Ki Baat
 magar sandip dikshit kaa kaarykram radio kaa nahin he, video kaa he
 Very few people watch this video
 log kyon nahin dekhte hai ise aap bhi dekh lijie
 Our research on radio cannot be final
 jo public main he usee ke aadhaar par hamane prastut kiya he
 On the occasion of Sarkarotsav, we got an opportunity to do research on radio, for this, we welcome the statement of Jaitley ji in which he said that radio was lagging behind for the last few years
 sarkarotsav ke maukey par survey bhi anek prakaar ke hote hai
 There is good news for the government in these surveys
 zyaadaatar log santusht hai
 Are happy in survey ko lekar bhi kuch masti kii ja sakati he
 Survey of Dainik Bhaskar says that 52 percent people are angry with the way of demonetisation, 83 percent people are happy with the surgical strike
 angreji akhbaar times of india ke survey main 11 pratishat logon ne sargical strike ko mahatvapurn faisla mana he, 48 fisadi logon ne notebandi ke faisle ko mahatvapurn mana he
 Now look at the survey of newspaper in Hindi and English
 kitna antar he
 The Hindi public is happy with 83 percent surgical strikes
 angrezi kii janata sargical strike se zyada notebandi ko mahatvapurn faisla maanati he
 While 52 percent of the people of Hindi are angry with demonetisation
 to survey main bhi kaaphi mazedaar masala rahata he
 Now see, according to Bhaskar, 83 percent of the public is happy with the surgical strike
 bibisi ko bhi apane survey main 83 pratishat janata mili he jo sargical strike se nahin, phek news se pareshaan he
 According to the survey, 83 percent of Indian viewers watching the news are worried about fake news
 inamen se 72 pratishat ko pataa lagane main mushkil hoti he ki koun si khabar sahi he koun si managasaint khabar he
 Who are these people who participate in the survey? ye sawaal poochne vaale bhi bahut mil jate hai
 The anniversary opportunity becomes tense due to claims, i try to lighten up a bit
 ab dekhiye trump sahab kaa koi lenaa dena nahin he magar unke teen video ke zariye ham purush maansikta ke angan main jhaank sakate hai
 See in these two videos, Trump tries to hold his wife's hand, but inadvertently she shuts Trump's hand
 ab jab saikado camere lage hon to raashtrapati ko bura to laga hi hoga, lekin jab mauka aayaa to trump ne patni ke haath jhatakane kaa badla purush netaaon ke kandhe ko jhatka dekar le liya
 They were trailing on the stage, just pushed and came in front of everyone
 jo bhi ho, sarkaar ne apane tamaam daavon se media main chal rahi bheed kii marpet, saharanpur kii hinsa vagairah jaisi khabaron ko peeche kar diya he
 The success figures are being delivered in public space with utmost strength through statements and advertisements
 pradhanmantri modi ne assam main kaha bhi he ki yah pehle kii jaisi sarkaar nahin he ki kya ho rahaa he, kahaan ho rahaa he, kuch pataa hi nahin chalata tha
 In telling this, this government really has no match
 bataane main bhi or batiyaane main bhi
 But in the meantime, the general public of India is creating different kinds of discourse
 ek video aayaa jisamen alvar main sikh samudaay ke kuch logon ke saath marpet ho rahi he
 When this video went viral, the Minorities Commission of Rajasthan came into action
 in sikh bhaaiyon kaa kahana he ki ve sevadaar hai or lungar ke liye anaaj ikattha karne nikle the
 Asked for help from the people to save but no one came
 bheed aaraam se inhen peet kar bhaag gai
 The police got the information from the sarpanch of the village
 police ne is maamle main sevadaar par bhi shanti bhang karne kaa aarope laga diya
 The crowd does not know how to become a victim of which Hindus also become Muslims, and Muslims also become Sikhs
 isliye samasya us bheed ke bheetar he, shaayad isamen shaamil hone vaale yuvaaon kii bechainiyon ko ham thik se samaj nahin paa rahe hai
 By watching this video, do not understand that the public has turned against the Sikhs
 is tarah ke dibet to tivi par bhi nahin hue hai
 a news from the Times of India gives us another perspective
 ajay kii yah khabar he ki haryana ke noujvaan sena main naukari paane ke liye nakli tarah se sikh ban ja rahe hai
 This is not done by any one youth but 51 youths have done it
 sena ne pichley do saal main aise maamalon main 51 exiaar darj karai he
 Many soldiers from Haryana tried to call themselves Jat Sikhs so that the Sikh Regiment of the army could join
 baad main pataa chalaa ki ve sikh nahin hai
 This news says a lot
 rojgaar mahatvapurn he, mazahab nahin
 When we can leave the village, city and country for employment, what can be said about religion? is bich sarkaar ne apni ulabdhiyaan khud to bataai hi hai, media bhi sarkaar kii kamyaabi se kaaphi prabhavit lagata he
 The Sakal newspaper has shown Prime Minister Modi as Bahubali on one of its pages
 kai tivi channelon par pradhanmantri ko bahubali rup main dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 The newspaper has given three and a half points out of 5 to the Prime Minister, but the position of stepping on the elephant's forehead with the trunk indicates that he has conquered
 hathi ko saamne se pakad lenaa, veerta ke sarvocch udaahranon main se ek he
 The Prime Minister of the imagination of the media is now Bahubali
 sarkaar apane daawey majbooti se rakhti he
 It does not keep from one place but in different ways in many cities
 vipaksh apane daawey ek press conferes main rakhane ke baad chalaa jaataa he
 Congress has made video items but government made video items can be overwhelming
 aap sarkaar kaa bhi video dekhiye or congress kaa bhi, khud faisla kiijie
 You saw that in this video of BJP there is a man who is boxing, that is a symbol of strength
 wo har panch ke saath sarkaar kii kamyaabi ko bataata he
 This shows that the government also wants to present itself as a powerful force
 jaise sakaal akhbaar ne pradhanmantri ko bahubali ke rup main pesh kiya he
 It is not that the government claims are not being challenged in the media, rather they are not able to take the lead
 bijli ko lekar kitne daawey kiye jate hai
 This sector is considered to be a successful sector of the government
 lekin india spend naam kii ek website ke anusaar bijepi sarkaar daawa karti he ki do saal main 13,523 gaanvon kaa vidyutikaran kar diya gaya he
 The comments 2015 main bijepi sarkaar ne 18,452 gaanvon kii pahchaan kii thi, inamen se 73 fisadi main bijli pahunch gai he
 But the government's own statistics say that only 8 percent of these villages have been electrified, that is, electricity connection has reached all the houses in these villages
 india spend kii site par kaha gaya he ki 25 pratishat gramin pariwaron ke yahaan abhi tak bijli nahin pahunchi he
 In a village, if the electricity reaches ten percent of the homes, apart from schools, panchayat offices and health centers, it is assumed that the village has become electrified
 agar kisi gaanv ke 90 fisadi gharon main bijli na ho to bhi use bijli yukt gaanv maan liya jaataa he
 It may be the policy of the government that all houses be connected to electricity
 ye nitigat samiksha he, lekin gas silendar baantne main sarkaar kii kamyaabi kii vipaksh ne bhi aalochana nahin kii he
 It is obvious that you cannot evaluate with just criticism, but only by claims
 aapako lagata he ki rojgaar ke sawaal, kisaanon kii aatmahatya ke sawaal se vipaksh sarkaar ko gherne main kaamyaab rahegaa, sochiyegaa
 So much has happened that they do not understand what would not have happened
 26 may 2014, yahi wo din he jab pradhanmantri modi ne pad va gopneeyata kii shapath lee thi lekin is din sarkaar apni saalagirah manaati he
 This is the third year
 do saal tak centre kii sarkaar akele hi sarkarotsav manaa rahi thi lekin is baar pattern change hua he
 State Governments have sent advertisements in Delhi newspapers and sent greetings of Sarkarotsav and have taken bullions
 rajya sarkarein bhi apni saalagirah manaati hai lekin ab unhen centre kii bhi saalagirah kaa bhaar khushi khushi uthaa rahi hai
 The question is that when Delhi's media covers Jharkhand with the agency's trust, news channels deal with Jharkhand in Speed news, then the Chief Minister of Jharkhand with the money of the people of that state but with the decision of the Chief Minister, advertisements in the newspapers of Delhi How appropriate to print
 slogan angrezi main he, on way to new india arthath nae bharat ke raste par he jharkhand
 The advertisement of the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chauhan is also good but hesitant
 sarkaar sahamate hue neeche likhaa he ki raja bhoj sethu kaa udghaatan hoga, lagata he ki is baat kaa khyaal rakhaa gaya he ki is pul ke udghaatan kii chaaya kahin assam main desh ke sabase bade pul kaa udghaatan par na pad jaae, jahaan pradhanmantri gaye hue hai
 Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has highlighted the achievements of the Center's government in her advertisements but has not forgotten the success of her government in the same money
 unhone aadhi jagah modi ji ko di he, aadhi jagah apni sarkaar ko di he
 In these three advertisements, Vasundhara ji seems to be more confident, if both the chief ministers do not mind my words
 upi ke yogi ji kii sarkaar main bhi aadhaapan or sanyasi bhav dikhataa he
 up's advertisement is also half a page
 yogi ji ko pataa he ki ve in teenon mukhyamantriyon par baari pad sakate hai to vigyaapan main kya jagah gherna
 Does India's media society live in Delhi, in whose newspapers the governments of the states advertise
 kerala kii sarkaar ke vigyaapan is tarah se aate hai jaise sipiem ke saare voter yaheen rahete hon
 Now the Orissa Government advertisements have also started coming
 desh dilli main na dikhe to dikhataa hi nahin hoga shaayad
 Anive, we thought that at this location we make a critical change, this is a change that is quite different from negative and positive change
 ab dekhiye saal bhar log poochhate rahete hai ki bharat main vipaksh nahin he
 Chief Ministers, leaders of 16 opposition parties gathered in Delhi
 dilli main vipaksh kaa dikhnaa bhi is tarah se dikhnaa lag rahaa he jaise bhaajapa shasit rajyon ne apane vigyaapan dilli ke akhabaaron main bhej diye hon
 Yet those who find the opposition can see that there is no shortage of leaders, the fact is that the media today is the anti-opposition media
 vipaksh ko jagah kam detaa he or phir sawaal bhi karata he ki vipaksh kahaan he
 It is a coincidence that the day that so many opposition leaders came to Delhi, the Prime Minister walked away from Delhi
 kahin aisa to nahin ki vipaksh ko dilli aata dekh, pradhanmantri assam chale gaye yaa pradhanmantri ko assam jaataa dekh, vipaksh dilli main jamaa ho gaya
 By the way, look at politics like mystery and creation, stories will thrill you
 aaj sarkarotsav he
 Many ministers of the central government are taking the message of success of the government in different directions
 is maukey par mantriyon ne tarah tarah ke kaaryakramon kaa aayojan kiya he
 Many programs have opened up as franchises
 jaise shahari vikaas mantri venkaiya naidu rajasthan ke ek gaanv main gram panchayat str par charchaa kii he
 Which is quite different from discussing tea and discussing khat
 khaat par charchaa kii yaad aate hi kuch yaad nahin aayaa
 On this occasion, i want to thank Vijay Goel ji
 unhone ek nae prakaar ke yuva kii khoj kii he
 Slum Youth
 slam yuva wo yuva he jo slam main rahata he
 This shows that it was not yet clear whether the youth were slum youth or posh youth
 twitor par jari poster ke vishleshan se lagata he ki yuvaaon kii pahchaan umr ke alaava ve kahaan basate hai, un bastiyon ke aadhaar par bhi ho sakati he
 The name of this program is Slum Youth Race
 adopt a slam yani god lijie dilli kaa ek slam
 It is not clear how one can adopt a slum in Delhi, the MP will adopt, the MLA will adopt, or these young people will adopt their slum, in whose lap they grow
 baharhaal nehru yuva centre ke tatvadhan main slam yuvaaon kii daud hui, bheed kaaphi thi, tii shart par bhi likhaa tha slam yuva daud
 Everything was in Hindi, only slum was shown in English
 jhuggi likh sakate the
 These photographs show that our slum youths also resemble the young ones growing up in the posh colonies of South Delhi
 phir bhi ye nayaa idia tha or acha idia laga, kuch kami hogi to vijay goyal ji udaar mantri hai, sudhaar kar lenge
 The motivation for slum adoption may have been derived from the Adarsh gram Yojana
 oktober 2014 main iskaa elaan hua tha ki har saansad ek gaanv god legaa or adarsh banayega
 The BJP has 281 mps, according to that 282 villages could have been projected as ideal after three years
 lagata he ab us par koi baat nahin karnaa chahta he
 Butt anway
 mul baat se shift hona ho to angrezi main bat aneve kaa istamaal karte hai
 Have you seen the chairs at the railway station? kitni kam hoti hai, jitne log baithe nahin hote hai usase zyada log baithe hue ko ghoorte rahete hai ki kab uthen ki ham baithen
 The news agency PTI released this picture when MP Hemamalini inaugurated the chairs at Mathura railway station
 tasviir dekhakar laga ki aisa udghaatan hota to hoga magar dekha pehali baar he
 But when we found out, Hema Malini did a good job
 mathura railway stesan itnaa vyast stesan he
 Nobody noticed that there should be seating arrangement for the passengers
 khambhon ke kinare gol gol baithne kaa system tha lekin hema malini ne ise badal diya he
 He has got 100 benches installed from his MP fund there
 platform number van par 40 bench, platform number do or teen par 40 bench or baaki par bees bench laga di he
 Till now we used to think that the railways would be arranging benches at the station, but this is a good use of MP fund
 sarkaar apni ulabdhiyon ke daavon se labalab he, vipaksh kahata he ki kuch hua hi nahin
 On the one hand, the leaders of the BJP bearing the lotus mark were seen standing on the tweeter, under the banyan, on the one hand, the Kamal Nath named Kamal has started counting from the Congress that 35 farmers are committing suicide every day
 7 saal main rojgaar apane nunatam str par he
 President Pranab Mukherjee expressed concern about fake news at the Ramnath Goenka Lecture Series held in the capital Delhi on Thursday
 kaha ki media kaa kaam he sarkaar se sawaal karnaa
 If the media is not doing its basic work, people are happy that the President has made a sarcasm on the Prime Minister and his government in gestures
 magar sarkarotsav ke rose raashtrapati bhawan main jab man kii baat par ai ek kitaab ke vimochan main raashtrapati pradhanmantri ke sanchaar kaushal communication skill kii tarif bhi karne lage
 a few days ago the President also said that Indira Gandhi is the most accepted Prime Minister of Indian history
 pradhanmantri modi ke bare main kah rahe hai ki ve ek prabhavi communicator hai or unki tulana pandit jawahar laal nehru or indira gandhi se bhi kii ja sakati he
 During this program, Defense Minister and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made a statement that radio had been falling behind for the last few years but PM Modi recognized the power of radio as a medium
 takat pahchaanane kii baat sahi he lekin pichley kuch saal se radio pichhadta ja rahaa tha is baat ko lekar alag alag raay ho sakati he
 There is no doubt that Mann Ki Baat is a unique program
 yah pehla radio kaarykram he jo usee samay tivi par bhi aata he
 Not only on TV but in Delhi it also comes on all private FM channels
 jab bhi man kii baat kii ghoshnaa hoti he us dauraan kisi bhi radio channel par iske alaava koi kaarykram nahin aata he
 Mann Ki Baat is also broadcast on Doordarshan
 isliye man kii baat ke asar ke vishleshan main sarkari tivi, privet channel, privet efem channel ko bhi shaamil karnaa chahie
 Can anyone else listen to someone else's FM channel stop their program? haa ye kaha ja saktaa he ki pradhanmantri ne tivi ko man kii baat ke dauraan radio main badal diya he
 FICCI KPMG gives information about the development of radio in its annual report
 2013 kii fikki kepiemji report ne kaha tha ki 2012 se 2017 ke bich radio 16
 Will grow at a growth rate of 6 percent
 2017 kii fikki kepiemji report main kaha gaya ki 2016 main radio ne 14
 Achieved a growth rate of 5 percent
 yani anumaan se kareeb do pratishat vikaas dar kam rahi
 Currently, there are 243 private radio channels operating in 86 cities in India
 san 2000 main radio sector kaa nijeekaran hua tha, kai sau channel nilaam hue hai magar oparation main 243 hi hai
 a report by FICCI KPMG says that the third phase auction has not shown much enthusiasm
 radio bhi kai prakaar ke hai
 Digital Radio, Community Radio
 inaki pragati bhi dekhni chahie
 Now let's look at the angle of revenue
 telecom regulatory athurity of india (tiarai) kii 15 march 2016 kii report kahati he ki 2014 main radio sector kaa rajasav 2013 kii tulana main 18 pratishat badha tha, 2019 tak iske rajasav main 18 pratishat kii hi vruddhi hone kii ummid he
 We do not have any independent information about the earnings from advertising and expenses incurred by advertising
 magar isse sambandhit do khabaren hamen internet ke archive main mili hai
 On 9 December 2016, Live Mint featured that Rajya Vardhan Rathore, a minister in the Lok Sabha, gave a written reply that in 2015-16, the revenue that has come from Mann Ki Baat is 4 crore 78 lakh
 5 agast 2015 ke indian express main artiai ke hawaale se ek khabar chhapi he ki sirf akhbaaron main man kii baat ke vigyaapan par saadhe aath karod rupee kharch kiye hai
 You saw that the revenue came to 4 crores 78 lakhs, about eight and a half crores was spent on advertising
 live mint ne sutron ke hawaale se likhaa he ki man kii baat ko zyaada vigyaapan sarkari vigyapanon se aata he
 While giving a written reply in the Lok Sabha, Minister Rajyavardhan Rathore had said that the revenue of All India Radio was 435 in 2014-15
 1 karod tha
 447 in 2015–16
 6 karod tha
 If we look at the revenue as well, then the revenue has increased by only 12 crore 66 lakh
 is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki radio kaa vikaas hua he
 It has happened but it is difficult to say how much has happened with the mind
 haa man kii baat kaa asar hua he
 Impressed by this, the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh also performs programs like Mann Ki Baat
 vipaksh ke netaaon main congress ke sandip dikshit ne man kii baat ke mukaable kaam kii baat shuru kii he
 But Sandeep Dixit's program is not about radio, but of video
 is video ko bahut hi kam log dekhte hai
 Why do people not see it? radio par hamaari research antim nahin ho sakati
 We have presented on the basis of what is in public
 sarkarotsav ke maukey par radio par research karne kaa mauka mila iske liye ham jetali ji ke us bayaan kaa swaagat karte hai jisamen unhone kaha tha ki pichley kuch saal se radio pichhadta ja rahaa tha
 There are many types of surveys on the occasion of the government festival
 in survey main sarkaar ke liye kaaphi acchhee khabar he
 Most people are satisfied
 khush hai
 Some fun can also be done with these surveys
 dainik bhaskar kaa survey kahata he ki 52 fisadi log notebandi ke tareeke se naaraaz hai, 83 fisadi log sargical strike se khush hai
 In the survey of English newspaper Times of India, 11 percent considered surgical strike as an important decision, 48 percent considered the decision of demonetization
 ab hindi or angrezi ke akhbaar ke survey ko dekhiye
 What a difference
 hindi kii janata 83 fisadi sargical strike se khush he
 The English public considers demonetisation more important than surgical strikes
 jabaki hindi kii janata main 52 fisadi notebandi se naaraaz hai
 So there is a lot of fun spice in the survey as well
 ab dekhiye bhaskar ke anusaar 83 pratishat janata sargical strike se khush he
 The BBC has also received 83 per cent of the public in its survey, which is troubled by fake news, not surgical strikes
 survey ke anusaar 83 pratishat news dekhne vaale bharat ke darshak phek news ko lekar chintit hai
 72 percent of them find it difficult to find out which news is right and which is the fabricated news
 ye koun log hai jo survey main shaamil hote hai
 Those who ask these questions are also found very much
 saalagirah kaa mauka daawey pratidaave ke kaaran tanaav kaa ho jaataa he, meraa prayaas he ki kuch halkaa ho jaae
 Now see, Trump has nothing to do with him, but through his three videos, we can peep into the courtyard of male mentality
 in do video main dekhiye trump apni patni kaa haath thaamne kaa prayaas karte hai magar jane anjaane main wo trump kaa haath jhatak detii hai
 Now when the cameras are set to hundreds, the President must have felt bad, but when the opportunity came, Trump took the revenge for jerking his wife's hand by jerking the shoulder of the male leaders
 ve manch par peechad rahe the, bas dhakka diya or sabake saamne aa gaye
 In any case, the government has backtracked the news of media mob attacks, Saharanpur violence etc
 with all its claims
 puri majbooti ke saath kamyaabi ke aankade public spes main bayanon or vigyapanon ke zariye pahunchaae ja rahe hai
 Prime Minister Modi has also said in Assam that it is not like the previous government that what was happening, where it is happening, nothing was known
 jo bataane main is sarkaar kaa vaaki koi muqabla nahin he
 Both in telling and also in telling
 lekin is bich bharat kii aam janata alag alag tarah ke vimarsh kaa nirmaan kar rahi hoti he
 a video came in which some people of the Sikh community are being beaten up in Alwar
 yah video jab viral hua to rajasthan kaa alpsankhyak ayog harakat main aa gaya
 These Sikh brothers say that they are servicemen and had gone to gather grain for the langar
 logon se madad maangi ki bachaa lo magar koi nahin aayaa
 The crowd comfortably thrashed them and ran away
 police ko is ghatana kii soochna gaanv ke sarpanch se mili
 Police also accused Sevadar of breaching the peace in this case
 bheed pataa nahin kaise ban jaati he jiske shikaar hindu bhi ho jate hai, musalmaan bhi ho jate hai or sikh bhi ho gaye
 So the problem lies within that crowd, perhaps we are not able to understand the restlessness of the youth joining it
 is video ko dekhakar yah mat samaj lijiega ki janata sikhon ke khilaaf ho gai he
 Such debates have not even happened on TV
 times of india kii ek khabar hamen ek or nazariyaa detii he
 Ajay's news is that the youth of Haryana are becoming fake Sikhs to get a job in the army
 aisa kamaal kisi ek yuvak ne nahin balki 51 yuvakon ne kiya he
 The Army has filed 51 firs in such cases in the last two years
 haryana ke kai javaanon ne khud ko jet sikh bataane kii koshish kii taaki sena kii sikh regiment jwine kar sake
 It is later revealed that they are not Sikhs
 yah khabar kaaphi kuch kahati he
 Employment is important, not religion
 rojgaar ke liye jab ham gaanv shahar or desh chhod sakate hai to mazahab ko lekar kya kaha ja saktaa he
 Meanwhile, the government has stated its achievements on its own, the media too seems impressed by the success of the government
 sakaal akhbaar ne apane ek pej par pradhanmantri modi ko bahubali ke rup main dikhaaya he
 The Prime Minister is being shown as Bahubali on many TV channels
 akhbaar ne pradhanmantri ko 5 main se saadhe teen ank diye hai magar sundh se chadhate hue hathi ke mastak par paanv rakh dene kii mudra bataati he ki unhone vijay praapt kar lee he
 One of the highest examples of valor is to hold the elephant in front
 media ke janamanas kii kalpana ke pradhanmantri ab bahubali bhi hai
 The government keeps its claims firmly
 ek jagah se nahin rakhti balki kai shaharon main alag alag tareeke se rakhti he
 The opposition goes after putting their claims in a press conference
 congress ne video item to banaae hai magar sarkaar ke banaae video item baari pad sakate hai
 Watch the video of the AAP government as well as the Congress, decide for yourself
 aapane dekha ki bijepi ke is video main ek banda he jo boxing kar rahaa he yani takat kaa pratik he
 He explains the success of the government with every punch
 isse pataa chalata he ki sarkaar khud ko bhi taqatvar balashaali rup main pesh karnaa chaahati he
 Like the Sakal newspaper has presented the Prime Minister as Bahubali
 aisa nahin he ki sarkari daavon ko media main chunauti nahin mil rahi he balki ve chunautiyaan pramukh jagah hasil nahin kar paati hai
 How many claims are made regarding electricity
 yah sector sarkaar kaa ek kaamyaab sector mana jaataa he
 But according to a website called indiaspend, the BJP government claims that 13,523 villages have been electrified in two years
 tippaniyan In 2015, the BJP government identified 18,452 villages, out of which 73% have access to electricity
 magar sarkaar ke hi aankade kehete hai ki inamen se maatr 8 pratishat gaanvon kaa hi sampurna vidyutikaran hua he yani in gaanvon ke sabhi gharon main bijli kaa conection pahunchaa he
 On the indiaspend site, it has been said that 25 percent of the rural families have not yet got electricity
 ek gaanv main agar skool, panchayat karyaalay or swasthya kendron ke alaava das pratishat gharon main bijli pahunchane par maan liya jaataa he ki us gaanv kaa vidyutikaran ho gaya
 Even if 90 percent of the households in a village do not have electricity, it is considered a village with electricity
 ho saktaa he ki ab sarkaar kii niti ho ki sabhi gharon ko bijli se joda jaae
 This is a policy review, but the government's success in distributing gas cylinders has not been criticized by the opposition either
 zaahir he ki aap moolyankan sirf aalochana se nahin kar sakate, sirf daavon se nahin kar sakate
 Do you think that the opposition will be able to surround the government with the question of employment, farmers' suicides
 sawaal yah he ki jab dilli kaa media jharkhand ko agency ke bharose cover karata he, news channel to jharkhand ko speed news main hi nipta dete hai to jharkhand ke mukhyamantri us rajya kii janata ke paise se magar mukhyamantri ke faisle se dilli ke akhbaaron main vigyaapan chhapana kitna uchit he
 Slogan is in English, on way to new india means Jharkhand is on the way to new India
 madhyapradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kaa vigyaapan bhi acha he magar sankochi he
 The government has written down that the Raja Bhoj Setu will be inaugurated, it seems that care has been taken that the inauguration of this bridge should not fall on the inauguration of the country's largest bridge in Assam, where the Prime Minister visited
 Huh
 rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne apane vigyapanon main centre kii sarkaar kii uplabdhiyaan ginai hai magar usee paise main apni sarkaar kii kamyaabi ginanaa nahin bhuuli hai
 He has given half the space to Modi ji, half the space to his government
 in teenon vigyapanon main vasundhara ji hi zyaada confident lag rahi hai, agar donon mukhyamantri meri baat kaa bura na maane to
 In the government of Yogi ji of UP, there is a feeling of subordination and sanity
 upi kaa vigyaapan bhi aadhe panne kaa he
 Yogi ji knows that if he can outweigh these three Chief Ministers, then what place should be included in the advertisement
 kya bharat kaa media samaaj dilli main rahata he, jiske akhabaaron main rajyon kii sarkarein vigyaapan detii rahati hai
 Kerala government advertisements come in such a way that all the CPM voters live here
 ab to urisa sarkaar ke vigyaapan bhi aane lage hai
 If the country is not seen in Delhi, it might not be visible
 aneve, hamane sochaa ki is okeshan par aalochanatmak badlaav karte hai, ye wo badlaav he jo nakaaratmak or sakaaratmak badlaav se kaaphi alag he
 Now see, throughout the year people keep asking that there is no opposition in India
 dilli main 16 vipakshi partiyon ke mukhyamantri, netaa jamaa hue
 Opposition in Delhi is also seen as if bjp-ruled states have sent their advertisements in Delhi newspapers
 phir bhi vipaksh ko khojane vaale dekh sakate hai ki netaaon kii khaas kami nahin he, asal baat yah he ki aaj kaa media vipaksh virdohi media he
 Gives space to the opposition and then questions where the opposition is
 sanyog hi he ki jis din vipaksh ke itane netaa dilli aae, usee din pradhananmatri dilli se dur chale gaye
 Is it not that if the opposition comes to Delhi, the Prime Minister goes to Assam or the Prime Minister goes to Assam, the opposition is gathered in Delhi
 vaise raajnneeti ko rahasy or rachana kii tarah dekhiye, aapako iske kisse romanchit karenge
 Today is Sarkarotsav
 centre sarkaar ke kai mantri alag-alag dishaao main sarkaar kii kamyaabi kaa sandesh lekar ja rahe hai
 On this occasion, ministers have organized various programs
 kai kaaryakramon kii frenchizi jaisi khul gai he
 For example, Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu has discussed at a village panchayat level in a village in Rajasthan
 jo ki chaay par charchaa or khaat par charchaa se kaaphi alag he
 As soon as i remembered the discussion on the bed, nothing was remembered
 isi maukey par main vijay goyal ji kaa dhanyavad karnaa chahta hum
 He has discovered a new type of youth
 slam yuva
 Slum youth is the youth who lives in slums
 isse pataa chalata he ki abhi tak jo yuva the saaf nahin tha ki ve slam yuva hai yaa posh yuva hai
 An analysis of the posters released on Twitter suggests that youth can be identified based on where they reside, apart from age
 is kaarykram kaa naam he slam yuva daud
 Adopt a slum means adopt a slum of Delhi
 isse yah saaf nahin he ki dilli ke ek slam ko koi god kaise le saktaa he, saansad god legaa, vidhayak god legaa yaa ye yuva hi apane slam ko god le lenge jisaki god main ye palate badhate hai
 However, under the auspices of Nehru Yuva Kendra, there was a race of slum youth, the crowd was considerable, the T-shirt also had a slum youth race
 sab kuch hindi main tha sirf slam angrezi main dikhaa
 Slum people could write
 in tasveeron se pataa chalata he ki hamaare slam yuva bhi dakshin dilli kii posh coloniyon main palane vaale yuvaaon jaise hi dikhte hai
 Nevertheless, this was a new idea and a good idea, if there is a shortage, Vijay Goyal is a liberal minister, he will improve
 slam god lene kii prerana shaayad adarsh gram yojana se lee gai hogi
 It was announced in October 2014 that every MP would adopt a village and make it ideal
 bhaajapa ke 281 saansad hai, us hisaab se teen saal baad 282 gaanvon ko adarsh rup main pesh kiya hi ja saktaa tha
 Seems like no one wants to talk to him anymore
 bat aneve
 If you want to shift from the original thing, then use butt anive in English
 kya aapane railway stesan par kursiyaan dekhi hai
 There are so few, more people keep staring at sitting than when they are not sitting, when we get up to sit
 samachar agency pitiai ne jab ye tasviir jari kii ki saansad hemamalini ne mathura railway stesan par kursiyon kaa udghaatan kiya he
 Seeing the picture, it would have been inaugurated, but saw it for the first time
 lekin jab hamane pataa kiya to hema malini ne acha kaam kiya he
 Mathura railway station is such a busy station
 kisi kaa dhyaan hi nahin gaya ki yatriyon ke baithne kii vyavastha honi chahie
 The pillars had a round seating system at the sides but Hema Malini has replaced it
 unhone vahaan par apane saansad nidhi se 100 bench lagava di he
 There are 40 benches on platform number one, 40 benches on platform number two and three and twenty benches on the rest
 abhi tak ham samajhate the ki railway hi stesan par bench kii vyavastha karti hogi, magar saansad nidhi kaa yah acha istemaal he
 The government is full of claims of its achievements, the opposition says that nothing has happened
 camel nishaan vaali bhaajapa ke netaa ek taraf uplabdhiyon ko lekar twitor se lekar bargad ke neeche khadey nazar aae to congress kii taraf se camel naam vaale kamalnath ne ginanaa shuru kar diya he ki 35 kisaan rose aatm hatya kar rahe hai
 Employment is at its lowest level in 7 years
 raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne guuruuvaar ko rajdhani dilli main yojit ramnath goyanka vyaakhyaan maala main phek news ke bare main chintaa jataai
 Said that the media's job is to question the government
 media apana mul kaam nahin kar rahaa he to log khush ho gaye hai ki raashtrapati ne ishaaron ishaaron main pradhanmantri or unki sarkaar par kataaksh kar diya he
 But in the Rashtrapati Bhavan on the day of Sarkarotsav, when the President released a book on Mann Ki Baat, the President also praised the communication skills communication skill of the Prime Minister
 kuch din pehle raashtrapati ne yah bhi kaha tha ki bhartiya itihaas kii indira gandhi sabase sweekrut pradhanmantri hai
 The Prime Minister is referring to Modi as an effective communicator and can also be compared to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi
 isi kaarykram ke dauraan raksha mantri or vitt mantri arun jetali ne bayaan diya ki pichley kuch saal se radio pichhadta ja rahaa tha lekin piem modi ne ek madhyam ke rup main radio kii takat ko pahachaanaa
 It is right to recognize the strength, but there may be different opinions about the fact that radio was lagging behind for the last few years
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki man kii baat ek anokhaa kaarykram he
 It is the first radio program that also appears on TV at the same time
 tivi par hi nahin, dilli main hi yah saare privet efem channelon par bhi aata he
 Whenever Mann Ki Baat is announced, no other program comes on any radio channel
 man kii baat kaa prasaaran doordarshan par bhi hota he
 Therefore, government TV, private channels, private FM channels should also be included in the analysis of the impact of Mann Ki Baat
 kya kisi or ke kaarykram ko efem channel apana kaarykram band kar suna sakate hai
 Yes, it can be said that the Prime Minister has changed TV to radio during Mann Ki Baat
 radio ke vikaas ke bare main fikki kepiemji apni salanaa report main jaankaree detii he
 The 2013 FICCI KPMG report stated that Radio 16 between 2012 and 2017
 6 pratishat kii growth rate se badhegaa
 The 2017 FICCI KPMG report stated that radio in 2016 had 14
 5 pratishat ke hisaab se hi growth rate hasil kii
 That is, the growth rate was lower by about two percent
 is vakt bharat ke 86 shaharon main 243 nijee radio channel chal rahe hai
 The radio sector was privatized in 2000, several hundred channels have been auctioned but only 243 are in operation
 fikki kepiemji kii report kahati he ki tisare charan kii nilaamee ko lekar khaasaa utsaah nahin dikhaa he
 Radios are also of many types
 digital radio, community radio
 Their progress should also be seen
 ab zaraa rajasav kaa angel dekh lete hai
 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) report of 15 March 2016 states that in 2014 the revenue of the radio sector grew by 18 percent compared to 2013, its revenue is expected to increase by 18 percent by 2019
 man kii baat se kamai or vigyaapan se hue kharche ko lekar hamaare paas koi swatantra jaankaree nahin he
 But we have got two news related to this in the archive of internet
 9 disambar 2016 ke live mint main chapa he ki loksabhaa main mantri rajyavardhan rathore ne likhit jawaab diya he ki 2015-16 main man kii baat se jo rajasav aayaa he wo 4 karod 78 lakh he
 RTI was quoted in Indian Express of August 5, 2015 as saying that only newspapers have spent eight and a half crores on advertisement of Mann Ki Baat
 aapane dekha ki rajasav aayaa 4 karod 78 lakh, vigyaapan par kharch hua kareeb dugana saadhe aath karod
 Live Mint has quoted sources as saying that more advertisements of Mann Ki Baat come from government advertisements
 loksabhaa main likhit jawaab dete hue mantri rajyavardhan rathod ne bataaya tha ki ol india radio kaa rajasav 2014-15 main 435
 1 crore
 2015-16 main 447
 6 crores
 to rajasav ke hisaab se bhi dekhiye to rajasav main maatr 12 karod 66 lakh kii vruddhi hui he
 There is no denying that radio has evolved
 hua he lekin man kii baat se kitna hua he kahana mushkil he
 Yes, Mann Ki Baat has been affected
 isse prabhavit hokar chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri ne bhi man kii baat jaisaa kaarykram karte hai
 Among the leaders of the opposition, Congress's Sandeep Dixit has started talking about work rather than Mann Ki Baat
 magar sandip dikshit kaa kaarykram radio kaa nahin he, video kaa he
 Very few people watch this video
 log kyon nahin dekhte hai ise aap bhi dekh lijie
 Our research on radio cannot be final
 jo public main he usee ke aadhaar par hamane prastut kiya he
 On the occasion of Sarkarotsav, we got an opportunity to do research on radio, for this, we welcome the statement of Jaitley ji in which he said that radio was lagging behind for the last few years
 sarkarotsav ke maukey par survey bhi anek prakaar ke hote hai
 There is good news for the government in these surveys
 zyaadaatar log santusht hai
 Are happy in survey ko lekar bhi kuch masti kii ja sakati he
 Survey of Dainik Bhaskar says that 52 percent people are angry with the way of demonetisation, 83 percent people are happy with the surgical strike
 angreji akhbaar times of india ke survey main 11 pratishat logon ne sargical strike ko mahatvapurn faisla mana he, 48 fisadi logon ne notebandi ke faisle ko mahatvapurn mana he
 Now look at the survey of newspaper in Hindi and English
 kitna antar he
 The Hindi public is happy with 83 percent surgical strikes
 angrezi kii janata sargical strike se zyada notebandi ko mahatvapurn faisla maanati he
 While 52 percent of the people of Hindi are angry with demonetisation
 to survey main bhi kaaphi mazedaar masala rahata he
 Now see, according to Bhaskar, 83 percent of the public is happy with the surgical strike
 bibisi ko bhi apane survey main 83 pratishat janata mili he jo sargical strike se nahin, phek news se pareshaan he
 According to the survey, 83 percent of Indian viewers watching the news are worried about fake news
 inamen se 72 pratishat ko pataa lagane main mushkil hoti he ki koun si khabar sahi he koun si managasaint khabar he
 Who are these people who participate in the survey? ye sawaal poochne vaale bhi bahut mil jate hai
 The anniversary opportunity becomes tense due to claims, i try to lighten up a bit
 ab dekhiye trump sahab kaa koi lenaa dena nahin he magar unke teen video ke zariye ham purush maansikta ke angan main jhaank sakate hai
 See in these two videos, Trump tries to hold his wife's hand, but inadvertently she shuts Trump's hand
 ab jab saikado camere lage hon to raashtrapati ko bura to laga hi hoga, lekin jab mauka aayaa to trump ne patni ke haath jhatakane kaa badla purush netaaon ke kandhe ko jhatka dekar le liya
 They were trailing on the stage, just pushed and came in front of everyone
 jo bhi ho, sarkaar ne apane tamaam daavon se media main chal rahi bheed kii marpet, saharanpur kii hinsa vagairah jaisi khabaron ko peeche kar diya he
 The success figures are being delivered in public space with utmost strength through statements and advertisements
 pradhanmantri modi ne assam main kaha bhi he ki yah pehle kii jaisi sarkaar nahin he ki kya ho rahaa he, kahaan ho rahaa he, kuch pataa hi nahin chalata tha
 In telling this, this government really has no match
 bataane main bhi or batiyaane main bhi
 But in the meantime, the general public of India is creating different kinds of discourse
 ek video aayaa jisamen alvar main sikh samudaay ke kuch logon ke saath marpet ho rahi he
 When this video went viral, the Minorities Commission of Rajasthan came into action
 in sikh bhaaiyon kaa kahana he ki ve sevadaar hai or lungar ke liye anaaj ikattha karne nikle the
 Asked for help from the people to save but no one came
 bheed aaraam se inhen peet kar bhaag gai
 The police got the information from the sarpanch of the village
 police ne is maamle main sevadaar par bhi shanti bhang karne kaa aarope laga diya
 The crowd does not know how to become a victim of which Hindus also become Muslims, and Muslims also become Sikhs
 isliye samasya us bheed ke bheetar he, shaayad isamen shaamil hone vaale yuvaaon kii bechainiyon ko ham thik se samaj nahin paa rahe hai
 By watching this video, do not understand that the public has turned against the Sikhs
 is tarah ke dibet to tivi par bhi nahin hue hai
 a news from the Times of India gives us another perspective
 ajay kii yah khabar he ki haryana ke noujvaan sena main naukari paane ke liye nakli tarah se sikh ban ja rahe hai
 This is not done by any one youth but 51 youths have done it
 sena ne pichley do saal main aise maamalon main 51 exiaar darj karai he
 Many soldiers from Haryana tried to call themselves Jat Sikhs so that the Sikh Regiment of the army could join
 baad main pataa chalaa ki ve sikh nahin hai
 This news says a lot
 rojgaar mahatvapurn he, mazahab nahin
 When we can leave the village, city and country for employment, what can be said about religion? is bich sarkaar ne apni ulabdhiyaan khud to bataai hi hai, media bhi sarkaar kii kamyaabi se kaaphi prabhavit lagata he
 The Sakal newspaper has shown Prime Minister Modi as Bahubali on one of its pages
 kai tivi channelon par pradhanmantri ko bahubali rup main dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 The newspaper has given three and a half points out of 5 to the Prime Minister, but the position of stepping on the elephant's forehead with the trunk indicates that he has conquered
 hathi ko saamne se pakad lenaa, veerta ke sarvocch udaahranon main se ek he
 The Prime Minister of the imagination of the media is now Bahubali
 sarkaar apane daawey majbooti se rakhti he
 It does not keep from one place but in different ways in many cities
 vipaksh apane daawey ek press conferes main rakhane ke baad chalaa jaataa he
 Congress has made video items but government made video items can be overwhelming
 aap sarkaar kaa bhi video dekhiye or congress kaa bhi, khud faisla kiijie
 You saw that in this video of BJP there is a man who is boxing, that is a symbol of strength
 wo har panch ke saath sarkaar kii kamyaabi ko bataata he
 This shows that the government also wants to present itself as a powerful force
 jaise sakaal akhbaar ne pradhanmantri ko bahubali ke rup main pesh kiya he
 It is not that the government claims are not being challenged in the media, rather they are not able to take the lead
 bijli ko lekar kitne daawey kiye jate hai
 This sector is considered to be a successful sector of the government
 lekin india spend naam kii ek website ke anusaar bijepi sarkaar daawa karti he ki do saal main 13,523 gaanvon kaa vidyutikaran kar diya gaya he
 The comments 2015 main bijepi sarkaar ne 18,452 gaanvon kii pahchaan kii thi, inamen se 73 fisadi main bijli pahunch gai he
 But the government's own statistics say that only 8 percent of these villages have been electrified, that is, electricity connection has reached all the houses in these villages
 india spend kii site par kaha gaya he ki 25 pratishat gramin pariwaron ke yahaan abhi tak bijli nahin pahunchi he
 In a village, if the electricity reaches ten percent of the homes, apart from schools, panchayat offices and health centers, it is assumed that the village has become electrified
 agar kisi gaanv ke 90 fisadi gharon main bijli na ho to bhi use bijli yukt gaanv maan liya jaataa he
 It may be the policy of the government that all houses be connected to electricity
 ye nitigat samiksha he, lekin gas silendar baantne main sarkaar kii kamyaabi kii vipaksh ne bhi aalochana nahin kii he
 It is obvious that you cannot evaluate with just criticism, but only by claims
 aapako lagata he ki rojgaar ke sawaal, kisaanon kii aatmahatya ke sawaal se vipaksh sarkaar ko gherne main kaamyaab rahegaa, sochiyegaa
 Does India's media society live in Delhi, in whose newspapers the governments of the states advertise
 kerala kii sarkaar ke vigyaapan is tarah se aate hai jaise sipiem ke saare voter yaheen rahete hon
 Now the Orissa Government advertisements have also started coming
 desh dilli main na dikhe to dikhataa hi nahin hoga shaayad
 Anive, we thought that at this location we make a critical change, this is a change that is quite different from negative and positive change
 ab dekhiye saal bhar log poochhate rahete hai ki bharat main vipaksh nahin he
 Chief Ministers, leaders of 16 opposition parties gathered in Delhi
 dilli main vipaksh kaa dikhnaa bhi is tarah se dikhnaa lag rahaa he jaise bhaajapa shasit rajyon ne apane vigyaapan dilli ke akhabaaron main bhej diye hon
 Yet those who find the opposition can see that there is no shortage of leaders, the fact is that the media today is the anti-opposition media
 vipaksh ko jagah kam detaa he or phir sawaal bhi karata he ki vipaksh kahaan he
 It is a coincidence that the day that so many opposition leaders came to Delhi, the Prime Minister walked away from Delhi
 kahin aisa to nahin ki vipaksh ko dilli aata dekh, pradhanmantri assam chale gaye yaa pradhanmantri ko assam jaataa dekh, vipaksh dilli main jamaa ho gaya
 By the way, look at politics like mystery and creation, stories will thrill you
 aaj sarkarotsav he
 Many ministers of the central government are taking the message of success of the government in different directions
 is maukey par mantriyon ne tarah tarah ke kaaryakramon kaa aayojan kiya he
 Many programs have opened up as franchises
 jaise shahari vikaas mantri venkaiya naidu rajasthan ke ek gaanv main gram panchayat str par charchaa kii he
 Which is quite different from discussing tea and discussing khat
 khaat par charchaa kii yaad aate hi kuch yaad nahin aayaa
 On this occasion, i want to thank Vijay Goel ji
 unhone ek nae prakaar ke yuva kii khoj kii he
 Slum Youth
 slam yuva wo yuva he jo slam main rahata he
 This shows that it was not yet clear whether the youth were slum youth or posh youth
 twitor par jari poster ke vishleshan se lagata he ki yuvaaon kii pahchaan umr ke alaava ve kahaan basate hai, un bastiyon ke aadhaar par bhi ho sakati he
 The name of this program is Slum Youth Race
 adopt a slam yani god lijie dilli kaa ek slam
 It is not clear how one can adopt a slum in Delhi, the MP will adopt, the MLA will adopt, or these young people will adopt their slum, in whose lap they grow
 baharhaal nehru yuva centre ke tatvadhan main slam yuvaaon kii daud hui, bheed kaaphi thi, tii shart par bhi likhaa tha slam yuva daud
 Everything was in Hindi, only slum was shown in English
 jhuggi likh sakate the
 These photographs show that our slum youths also resemble the young ones growing up in the posh colonies of South Delhi
 phir bhi ye nayaa idia tha or acha idia laga, kuch kami hogi to vijay goyal ji udaar mantri hai, sudhaar kar lenge
 The motivation for slum adoption may have been derived from the Adarsh gram Yojana
 oktober 2014 main iskaa elaan hua tha ki har saansad ek gaanv god legaa or adarsh banayega
 The BJP has 281 mps, according to that 282 villages could have been projected as ideal after three years
 lagata he ab us par koi baat nahin karnaa chahta he
 Butt anway
 mul baat se shift hona ho to angrezi main bat aneve kaa istamaal karte hai
 Have you seen the chairs at the railway station? kitni kam hoti hai, jitne log baithe nahin hote hai usase zyada log baithe hue ko ghoorte rahete hai ki kab uthen ki ham baithen
 The news agency PTI released this picture when MP Hemamalini inaugurated the chairs at Mathura railway station
 tasviir dekhakar laga ki aisa udghaatan hota to hoga magar dekha pehali baar he

 He has got 100 benches installed from his MP fund there
 platform number van par 40 bench, platform number do or teen par 40 bench or baaki par bees bench laga di he
 Till now we used to think that the railways would be arranging benches at the station, but this is a good use of MP fund
 sarkaar apni ulabdhiyon ke daavon se labalab he, vipaksh kahata he ki kuch hua hi nahin
 On the one hand, the leaders of the BJP bearing the lotus mark were seen standing on the tweeter, under the banyan, on the one hand, the Kamal Nath named Kamal has started counting from the Congress that 35 farmers are committing suicide every day

 President Pranab Mukherjee expressed concern about fake news at the Ramnath Goenka Lecture Series held in the capital Delhi on Thursday
 kaha ki media kaa kaam he sarkaar se sawaal karnaa
 If the media is not doing its basic work, people are happy that the President has made a sarcasm on the Prime Minister and his government in gestures
 magar sarkarotsav ke rose raashtrapati bhawan main jab man kii baat par ai ek kitaab ke vimochan main raashtrapati pradhanmantri ke sanchaar kaushal communication skill kii tarif bhi karne lage
 a few days ago the President also said that Indira Gandhi is the most accepted Prime Minister of Indian history
 pradhanmantri modi ke bare main kah rahe hai ki ve ek prabhavi communicator hai or unki tulana pandit jawahar laal nehru or indira gandhi se bhi kii ja sakati he
 During this program, Defense Minister and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made a statement that radio had been falling behind for the last few years but PM Modi recognized the power of radio as a medium
 takat pahchaanane kii baat sahi he lekin pichley kuch saal se radio pichhadta ja rahaa tha is baat ko lekar alag alag raay ho sakati he
 There is no doubt that Mann Ki Baat is a unique program
 yah pehla radio kaarykram he jo usee samay tivi par bhi aata he
 Not only on TV but in Delhi it also comes on all private FM channels
 jab bhi man kii baat kii ghoshnaa hoti he us dauraan kisi bhi radio channel par iske alaava koi kaarykram nahin aata he
 Mann Ki Baat is also broadcast on Doordarshan
 isliye man kii baat ke asar ke vishleshan main sarkari tivi, privet channel, privet efem channel ko bhi shaamil karnaa chahie
 Can anyone else listen to someone else's FM channel stop their program? haa ye kaha ja saktaa he ki pradhanmantri ne tivi ko man kii baat ke dauraan radio main badal diya he
 FICCI KPMG gives information about the development of radio in its annual report
 2013 kii fikki kepiemji report ne kaha tha ki 2012 se 2017 ke bich radio 16
 Will grow at a growth rate of 6 percent
 2017 kii fikki kepiemji report main kaha gaya ki 2016 main radio ne 14
 Achieved a growth rate of 5 percent
 yani anumaan se kareeb do pratishat vikaas dar kam rahi
 Currently, there are 243 private radio channels operating in 86 cities in India
 san 2000 main radio sector kaa nijeekaran hua tha, kai sau channel nilaam hue hai magar oparation main 243 hi hai
 a report by FICCI KPMG says that the third phase auction has not shown much enthusiasm
 radio bhi kai prakaar ke hai
 Digital Radio, Community Radio
 inaki pragati bhi dekhni chahie
 Now let's look at the angle of revenue
 telecom regulatory athurity of india (tiarai) kii 15 march 2016 kii report kahati he ki 2014 main radio sector kaa rajasav 2013 kii tulana main 18 pratishat badha tha, 2019 tak iske rajasav main 18 pratishat kii hi vruddhi hone kii ummid he
 We do not have any independent information about the earnings from advertising and expenses incurred by advertising
 magar isse sambandhit do khabaren hamen internet ke archive main mili hai
 On 9 December 2016, Live Mint featured that Rajya Vardhan Rathore, a minister in the Lok Sabha, gave a written reply that in 2015-16, the revenue that has come from Mann Ki Baat is 4 crore 78 lakh
 5 agast 2015 ke indian express main artiai ke hawaale se ek khabar chhapi he ki sirf akhbaaron main man kii baat ke vigyaapan par saadhe aath karod rupee kharch kiye hai
 You saw that the revenue came to 4 crores 78 lakhs, about eight and a half crores was spent on advertising
 live mint ne sutron ke hawaale se likhaa he ki man kii baat ko zyaada vigyaapan sarkari vigyapanon se aata he
 While giving a written reply in the Lok Sabha, Minister Rajyavardhan Rathore had said that the revenue of All India Radio was 435 in 2014-15
 1 karod tha
 447 in 2015–16
 6 karod tha
 If we look at the revenue as well, then the revenue has increased by only 12 crore 66 lakh
 is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki radio kaa vikaas hua he
 It has happened but it is difficult to say how much has happened with the mind
 haa man kii baat kaa asar hua he
 Impressed by this, the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh also performs programs like Mann Ki Baat
 vipaksh ke netaaon main congress ke sandip dikshit ne man kii baat ke mukaable kaam kii baat shuru kii he
 But Sandeep Dixit's program is not about radio, but of video
 is video ko bahut hi kam log dekhte hai
 Why do people not see it? radio par hamaari research antim nahin ho sakati
 We have presented on the basis of what is in public
 sarkarotsav ke maukey par radio par research karne kaa mauka mila iske liye ham jetali ji ke us bayaan kaa swaagat karte hai jisamen unhone kaha tha ki pichley kuch saal se radio pichhadta ja rahaa tha
 There are many types of surveys on the occasion of the government festival
 in survey main sarkaar ke liye kaaphi acchhee khabar he
 Most people are satisfied
 khush hai
 Some fun can also be done with these surveys
 dainik bhaskar kaa survey kahata he ki 52 fisadi log notebandi ke tareeke se naaraaz hai, 83 fisadi log sargical strike se khush hai
 In the survey of English newspaper Times of India, 11 percent considered surgical strike as an important decision, 48 percent considered the decision of demonetization
 ab hindi or angrezi ke akhbaar ke survey ko dekhiye
 What a difference
 hindi kii janata 83 fisadi sargical strike se khush he
 The English public considers demonetisation more important than surgical strikes
 jabaki hindi kii janata main 52 fisadi notebandi se naaraaz hai
 So there is a lot of fun spice in the survey as well
 ab dekhiye bhaskar ke anusaar 83 pratishat janata sargical strike se khush he
 The BBC has also received 83 per cent of the public in its survey, which is troubled by fake news, not surgical strikes
 survey ke anusaar 83 pratishat news dekhne vaale bharat ke darshak phek news ko lekar chintit hai
 72 percent of them find it difficult to find out which news is right and which is the fabricated news
 ye koun log hai jo survey main shaamil hote hai
 Those who ask these questions are also found very much
 saalagirah kaa mauka daawey pratidaave ke kaaran tanaav kaa ho jaataa he, meraa prayaas he ki kuch halkaa ho jaae
 Now see, Trump has nothing to do with him, but through his three videos, we can peep into the courtyard of male mentality
 in do video main dekhiye trump apni patni kaa haath thaamne kaa prayaas karte hai magar jane anjaane main wo trump kaa haath jhatak detii hai
 Now when the cameras are set to hundreds, the President must have felt bad, but when the opportunity came, Trump took the revenge for jerking his wife's hand by jerking the shoulder of the male leaders
 ve manch par peechad rahe the, bas dhakka diya or sabake saamne aa gaye
 In any case, the government has backtracked the news of media mob attacks, Saharanpur violence etc
 with all its claims
 puri majbooti ke saath kamyaabi ke aankade public spes main bayanon or vigyapanon ke zariye pahunchaae ja rahe hai
 Prime Minister Modi has also said in Assam that it is not like the previous government that what was happening, where it is happening, nothing was known
 jo bataane main is sarkaar kaa vaaki koi muqabla nahin he
 Both in telling and also in telling
 lekin is bich bharat kii aam janata alag alag tarah ke vimarsh kaa nirmaan kar rahi hoti he
 a video came in which some people of the Sikh community are being beaten up in Alwar
 yah video jab viral hua to rajasthan kaa alpsankhyak ayog harakat main aa gaya
 These Sikh brothers say that they are servicemen and had gone to gather grain for the langar
 logon se madad maangi ki bachaa lo magar koi nahin aayaa
 The crowd comfortably thrashed them and ran away
 police ko is ghatana kii soochna gaanv ke sarpanch se mili
 Police also accused Sevadar of breaching the peace in this case
 bheed pataa nahin kaise ban jaati he jiske shikaar hindu bhi ho jate hai, musalmaan bhi ho jate hai or sikh bhi ho gaye
 So the problem lies within that crowd, perhaps we are not able to understand the restlessness of the youth joining it
 is video ko dekhakar yah mat samaj lijiega ki janata sikhon ke khilaaf ho gai he
 Such debates have not even happened on TV
 times of india kii ek khabar hamen ek or nazariyaa detii he
 Ajay's news is that the youth of Haryana are becoming fake Sikhs to get a job in the army
 aisa kamaal kisi ek yuvak ne nahin balki 51 yuvakon ne kiya he
 The Army has filed 51 firs in such cases in the last two years
 haryana ke kai javaanon ne khud ko jet sikh bataane kii koshish kii taaki sena kii sikh regiment jwine kar sake
 It is later revealed that they are not Sikhs
 yah khabar kaaphi kuch kahati he
 Employment is important, not religion
 rojgaar ke liye jab ham gaanv shahar or desh chhod sakate hai to mazahab ko lekar kya kaha ja saktaa he
 Meanwhile, the government has stated its achievements on its own, the media too seems impressed by the success of the government
 sakaal akhbaar ne apane ek pej par pradhanmantri modi ko bahubali ke rup main dikhaaya he
 The Prime Minister is being shown as Bahubali on many TV channels
 akhbaar ne pradhanmantri ko 5 main se saadhe teen ank diye hai magar sundh se chadhate hue hathi ke mastak par paanv rakh dene kii mudra bataati he ki unhone vijay praapt kar lee he
 One of the highest examples of valor is to hold the elephant in front
 media ke janamanas kii kalpana ke pradhanmantri ab bahubali bhi hai
 The government keeps its claims firmly
 ek jagah se nahin rakhti balki kai shaharon main alag alag tareeke se rakhti he
 The opposition goes after putting their claims in a press conference
 congress ne video item to banaae hai magar sarkaar ke banaae video item baari pad sakate hai
 Watch the video of the AAP government as well as the Congress, decide for yourself
 aapane dekha ki bijepi ke is video main ek banda he jo boxing kar rahaa he yani takat kaa pratik he
 He explains the success of the government with every punch
 isse pataa chalata he ki sarkaar khud ko bhi taqatvar balashaali rup main pesh karnaa chaahati he
 Like the Sakal newspaper has presented the Prime Minister as Bahubali
 aisa nahin he ki sarkari daavon ko media main chunauti nahin mil rahi he balki ve chunautiyaan pramukh jagah hasil nahin kar paati hai
 How many claims are made regarding electricity
 yah sector sarkaar kaa ek kaamyaab sector mana jaataa he
 But according to a website called indiaspend, the BJP government claims that 13,523 villages have been electrified in two years
 tippaniyan In 2015, the BJP government identified 18,452 villages, out of which 73% have access to electricity
 magar sarkaar ke hi aankade kehete hai ki inamen se maatr 8 pratishat gaanvon kaa hi sampurna vidyutikaran hua he yani in gaanvon ke sabhi gharon main bijli kaa conection pahunchaa he
 On the indiaspend site, it has been said that 25 percent of the rural families have not yet got electricity
 ek gaanv main agar skool, panchayat karyaalay or swasthya kendron ke alaava das pratishat gharon main bijli pahunchane par maan liya jaataa he ki us gaanv kaa vidyutikaran ho gaya
 Even if 90 percent of the households in a village do not have electricity, it is considered a village with electricity
 ho saktaa he ki ab sarkaar kii niti ho ki sabhi gharon ko bijli se joda jaae
 This is a policy review, but the government's success in distributing gas cylinders has not been criticized by the opposition either
 zaahir he ki aap moolyankan sirf aalochana se nahin kar sakate, sirf daavon se nahin kar sakate
 Do you think that the opposition will be able to surround the government with the question of employment, farmers' suicides
 dilli main vipaksh kaa dikhnaa bhi is tarah se dikhnaa lag rahaa he jaise bhaajapa shasit rajyon ne apane vigyaapan dilli ke akhabaaron main bhej diye hon
 Yet those who find the opposition can see that there is no shortage of leaders, the fact is that the media today is the anti-opposition media
 vipaksh ko jagah kam detaa he or phir sawaal bhi karata he ki vipaksh kahaan he
 It is a coincidence that the day that so many opposition leaders came to Delhi, the Prime Minister walked away from Delhi
 kahin aisa to nahin ki vipaksh ko dilli aata dekh, pradhanmantri assam chale gaye yaa pradhanmantri ko assam jaataa dekh, vipaksh dilli main jamaa ho gaya
 By the way, look at politics like mystery and creation, stories will thrill you
 aaj sarkarotsav he
 Many ministers of the central government are taking the message of success of the government in different directions
 is maukey par mantriyon ne tarah tarah ke kaaryakramon kaa aayojan kiya he
 Many programs have opened up as franchises
 jaise shahari vikaas mantri venkaiya naidu rajasthan ke ek gaanv main gram panchayat str par charchaa kii he
 Which is quite different from discussing tea and discussing khat
 khaat par charchaa kii yaad aate hi kuch yaad nahin aayaa
 On this occasion, i want to thank Vijay Goel ji
 unhone ek nae prakaar ke yuva kii khoj kii he
 Slum Youth
 slam yuva wo yuva he jo slam main rahata he
 This shows that it was not yet clear whether the youth were slum youth or posh youth
 twitor par jari poster ke vishleshan se lagata he ki yuvaaon kii pahchaan umr ke alaava ve kahaan basate hai, un bastiyon ke aadhaar par bhi ho sakati he
 The name of this program is Slum Youth Race
 adopt a slam yani god lijie dilli kaa ek slam
 It is not clear how one can adopt a slum in Delhi, the MP will adopt, the MLA will adopt, or these young people will adopt their slum, in whose lap they grow
 baharhaal nehru yuva centre ke tatvadhan main slam yuvaaon kii daud hui, bheed kaaphi thi, tii shart par bhi likhaa tha slam yuva daud
 Everything was in Hindi, only slum was shown in English
 jhuggi likh sakate the
 These photographs show that our slum youths also resemble the young ones growing up in the posh colonies of South Delhi
 phir bhi ye nayaa idia tha or acha idia laga, kuch kami hogi to vijay goyal ji udaar mantri hai, sudhaar kar lenge
 The motivation for slum adoption may have been derived from the Adarsh gram Yojana
 oktober 2014 main iskaa elaan hua tha ki har saansad ek gaanv god legaa or adarsh banayega
 The BJP has 281 mps, according to that 282 villages could have been projected as ideal after three years
 lagata he ab us par koi baat nahin karnaa chahta he
 Butt anway
 mul baat se shift hona ho to angrezi main bat aneve kaa istamaal karte hai

 Which is quite different from discussing tea and discussing khat
 khaat par charchaa kii yaad aate hi kuch yaad nahin aayaa
 On this occasion, i want to thank Vijay Goel ji
 unhone ek nae prakaar ke yuva kii khoj kii he
 Slum Youth
 slam yuva wo yuva he jo slam main rahata he
 This shows that it was not yet clear whether the youth were slum youth or posh youth
 twitor par jari poster ke vishleshan se lagata he ki yuvaaon kii pahchaan umr ke alaava ve kahaan basate hai, un bastiyon ke aadhaar par bhi ho sakati he
 The name of this program is Slum Youth Race
 adopt a slam yani god lijie dilli kaa ek slam
 It is not clear how one can adopt a slum in Delhi, the MP will adopt, the MLA will adopt, or these young people will adopt their slum, in whose lap they grow
 baharhaal nehru yuva centre ke tatvadhan main slam yuvaaon kii daud hui, bheed kaaphi thi, tii shart par bhi likhaa tha slam yuva daud
 Everything was in Hindi, only slum was shown in English
 jhuggi likh sakate the
 These photographs show that our slum youths also resemble the young ones growing up in the posh colonies of South Delhi
 phir bhi ye nayaa idia tha or acha idia laga, kuch kami hogi to vijay goyal ji udaar mantri hai, sudhaar kar lenge
 The motivation for slum adoption may have been derived from the Adarsh gram Yojana
 oktober 2014 main iskaa elaan hua tha ki har saansad ek gaanv god legaa or adarsh banayega
 The BJP has 281 mps, according to that 282 villages could have been projected as ideal after three years

 Butt anway
 mul baat se shift hona ho to angrezi main bat aneve kaa istamaal karte hai
 Have you seen the chairs at the railway station? kitni kam hoti hai, jitne log baithe nahin hote hai usase zyada log baithe hue ko ghoorte rahete hai ki kab uthen ki ham baithen
 The news agency PTI released this picture when MP Hemamalini inaugurated the chairs at Mathura railway station
 tasviir dekhakar laga ki aisa udghaatan hota to hoga magar dekha pehali baar he
 But when we found out, Hema Malini did a good job
 mathura railway stesan itnaa vyast stesan he
 Nobody noticed that there should be seating arrangement for the passengers
 khambhon ke kinare gol gol baithne kaa system tha lekin hema malini ne ise badal diya he
 He has got 100 benches installed from his MP fund there
 platform number van par 40 bench, platform number do or teen par 40 bench or baaki par bees bench laga di he
 Till now we used to think that the railways would be arranging benches at the station, but this is a good use of MP fund
 sarkaar apni ulabdhiyon ke daavon se labalab he, vipaksh kahata he ki kuch hua hi nahin
 On the one hand, the leaders of the BJP bearing the lotus mark were seen standing on the tweeter, under the banyan, on the one hand, the Kamal Nath named Kamal has started counting from the Congress that 35 farmers are committing suicide every day
 7 saal main rojgaar apane nunatam str par he
 President Pranab Mukherjee expressed concern about fake news at the Ramnath Goenka Lecture Series held in the capital Delhi on Thursday
 kaha ki media kaa kaam he sarkaar se sawaal karnaa
 If the media is not doing its basic work, people are happy that the President has made a sarcasm on the Prime Minister and his government in gestures
 magar sarkarotsav ke rose raashtrapati bhawan main jab man kii baat par ai ek kitaab ke vimochan main raashtrapati pradhanmantri ke sanchaar kaushal communication skill kii tarif bhi karne lage
 a few days ago the President also said that Indira Gandhi is the most accepted Prime Minister of Indian history
 pradhanmantri modi ke bare main kah rahe hai ki ve ek prabhavi communicator hai or unki tulana pandit jawahar laal nehru or indira gandhi se bhi kii ja sakati he
 During this program, Defense Minister and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made a statement that radio had been falling behind for the last few years but PM Modi recognized the power of radio as a medium
 takat pahchaanane kii baat sahi he lekin pichley kuch saal se radio pichhadta ja rahaa tha is baat ko lekar alag alag raay ho sakati he
 There is no doubt that Mann Ki Baat is a unique program
 yah pehla radio kaarykram he jo usee samay tivi par bhi aata he
 Not only on TV but in Delhi it also comes on all private FM channels
 jab bhi man kii baat kii ghoshnaa hoti he us dauraan kisi bhi radio channel par iske alaava koi kaarykram nahin aata he
 Mann Ki Baat is also broadcast on Doordarshan
 isliye man kii baat ke asar ke vishleshan main sarkari tivi, privet channel, privet efem channel ko bhi shaamil karnaa chahie
 Can anyone else listen to someone else's FM channel stop their program? haa ye kaha ja saktaa he ki pradhanmantri ne tivi ko man kii baat ke dauraan radio main badal diya he
 FICCI KPMG gives information about the development of radio in its annual report
 2013 kii fikki kepiemji report ne kaha tha ki 2012 se 2017 ke bich radio 16
 Will grow at a growth rate of 6 percent
 2017 kii fikki kepiemji report main kaha gaya ki 2016 main radio ne 14
 Achieved a growth rate of 5 percent
 yani anumaan se kareeb do pratishat vikaas dar kam rahi
 Currently, there are 243 private radio channels operating in 86 cities in India
 san 2000 main radio sector kaa nijeekaran hua tha, kai sau channel nilaam hue hai magar oparation main 243 hi hai
 a report by FICCI KPMG says that the third phase auction has not shown much enthusiasm
 radio bhi kai prakaar ke hai
 Digital Radio, Community Radio
 inaki pragati bhi dekhni chahie
 Now let's look at the angle of revenue
 telecom regulatory athurity of india (tiarai) kii 15 march 2016 kii report kahati he ki 2014 main radio sector kaa rajasav 2013 kii tulana main 18 pratishat badha tha, 2019 tak iske rajasav main 18 pratishat kii hi vruddhi hone kii ummid he
 We do not have any independent information about the earnings from advertising and expenses incurred by advertising
 magar isse sambandhit do khabaren hamen internet ke archive main mili hai
 On 9 December 2016, Live Mint featured that Rajya Vardhan Rathore, a minister in the Lok Sabha, gave a written reply that in 2015-16, the revenue that has come from Mann Ki Baat is 4 crore 78 lakh
 5 agast 2015 ke indian express main artiai ke hawaale se ek khabar chhapi he ki sirf akhbaaron main man kii baat ke vigyaapan par saadhe aath karod rupee kharch kiye hai
 You saw that the revenue came to 4 crores 78 lakhs, about eight and a half crores was spent on advertising
 live mint ne sutron ke hawaale se likhaa he ki man kii baat ko zyaada vigyaapan sarkari vigyapanon se aata he
 While giving a written reply in the Lok Sabha, Minister Rajyavardhan Rathore had said that the revenue of All India Radio was 435 in 2014-15
 1 karod tha
 447 in 2015–16
 6 karod tha
 If we look at the revenue as well, then the revenue has increased by only 12 crore 66 lakh
 is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki radio kaa vikaas hua he
 It has happened but it is difficult to say how much has happened with the mind
 haa man kii baat kaa asar hua he
 Impressed by this, the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh also performs programs like Mann Ki Baat
 vipaksh ke netaaon main congress ke sandip dikshit ne man kii baat ke mukaable kaam kii baat shuru kii he
 But Sandeep Dixit's program is not about radio, but of video
 is video ko bahut hi kam log dekhte hai
 Why do people not see it? radio par hamaari research antim nahin ho sakati
 We have presented on the basis of what is in public
 sarkarotsav ke maukey par radio par research karne kaa mauka mila iske liye ham jetali ji ke us bayaan kaa swaagat karte hai jisamen unhone kaha tha ki pichley kuch saal se radio pichhadta ja rahaa tha
 There are many types of surveys on the occasion of the government festival
 in survey main sarkaar ke liye kaaphi acchhee khabar he
 Most people are satisfied
 khush hai
 Some fun can also be done with these surveys
 dainik bhaskar kaa survey kahata he ki 52 fisadi log notebandi ke tareeke se naaraaz hai, 83 fisadi log sargical strike se khush hai
 In the survey of English newspaper Times of India, 11 percent considered surgical strike as an important decision, 48 percent considered the decision of demonetization
 ab hindi or angrezi ke akhbaar ke survey ko dekhiye
 What a difference
 hindi kii janata 83 fisadi sargical strike se khush he
 The English public considers demonetisation more important than surgical strikes
 jabaki hindi kii janata main 52 fisadi notebandi se naaraaz hai
 So there is a lot of fun spice in the survey as well
 ab dekhiye bhaskar ke anusaar 83 pratishat janata sargical strike se khush he
 The BBC has also received 83 per cent of the public in its survey, which is troubled by fake news, not surgical strikes
 survey ke anusaar 83 pratishat news dekhne vaale bharat ke darshak phek news ko lekar chintit hai
 72 percent of them find it difficult to find out which news is right and which is the fabricated news
 ye koun log hai jo survey main shaamil hote hai
 Those who ask these questions are also found very much
 saalagirah kaa mauka daawey pratidaave ke kaaran tanaav kaa ho jaataa he, meraa prayaas he ki kuch halkaa ho jaae
 Now see, Trump has nothing to do with him, but through his three videos, we can peep into the courtyard of male mentality
 in do video main dekhiye trump apni patni kaa haath thaamne kaa prayaas karte hai magar jane anjaane main wo trump kaa haath jhatak detii hai
 Now when the cameras are set to hundreds, the President must have felt bad, but when the opportunity came, Trump took the revenge for jerking his wife's hand by jerking the shoulder of the male leaders
 ve manch par peechad rahe the, bas dhakka diya or sabake saamne aa gaye
 In any case, the government has backtracked the news of media mob attacks, Saharanpur violence etc
 with all its claims
 puri majbooti ke saath kamyaabi ke aankade public spes main bayanon or vigyapanon ke zariye pahunchaae ja rahe hai
 Prime Minister Modi has also said in Assam that it is not like the previous government that what was happening, where it is happening, nothing was known
 jo bataane main is sarkaar kaa vaaki koi muqabla nahin he
 Both in telling and also in telling
 lekin is bich bharat kii aam janata alag alag tarah ke vimarsh kaa nirmaan kar rahi hoti he
 a video came in which some people of the Sikh community are being beaten up in Alwar
 yah video jab viral hua to rajasthan kaa alpsankhyak ayog harakat main aa gaya
 These Sikh brothers say that they are servicemen and had gone to gather grain for the langar
 logon se madad maangi ki bachaa lo magar koi nahin aayaa
 The crowd comfortably thrashed them and ran away
 police ko is ghatana kii soochna gaanv ke sarpanch se mili
 Police also accused Sevadar of breaching the peace in this case
 bheed pataa nahin kaise ban jaati he jiske shikaar hindu bhi ho jate hai, musalmaan bhi ho jate hai or sikh bhi ho gaye
 So the problem lies within that crowd, perhaps we are not able to understand the restlessness of the youth joining it
 is video ko dekhakar yah mat samaj lijiega ki janata sikhon ke khilaaf ho gai he
 Such debates have not even happened on TV
 times of india kii ek khabar hamen ek or nazariyaa detii he
 Ajay's news is that the youth of Haryana are becoming fake Sikhs to get a job in the army
 aisa kamaal kisi ek yuvak ne nahin balki 51 yuvakon ne kiya he
 The Army has filed 51 firs in such cases in the last two years
 haryana ke kai javaanon ne khud ko jet sikh bataane kii koshish kii taaki sena kii sikh regiment jwine kar sake
 It is later revealed that they are not Sikhs
 yah khabar kaaphi kuch kahati he
 Employment is important, not religion
 rojgaar ke liye jab ham gaanv shahar or desh chhod sakate hai to mazahab ko lekar kya kaha ja saktaa he
 Meanwhile, the government has stated its achievements on its own, the media too seems impressed by the success of the government
 sakaal akhbaar ne apane ek pej par pradhanmantri modi ko bahubali ke rup main dikhaaya he
 The Prime Minister is being shown as Bahubali on many TV channels
 akhbaar ne pradhanmantri ko 5 main se saadhe teen ank diye hai magar sundh se chadhate hue hathi ke mastak par paanv rakh dene kii mudra bataati he ki unhone vijay praapt kar lee he
 One of the highest examples of valor is to hold the elephant in front
 media ke janamanas kii kalpana ke pradhanmantri ab bahubali bhi hai
 The government keeps its claims firmly
 ek jagah se nahin rakhti balki kai shaharon main alag alag tareeke se rakhti he
 The opposition goes after putting their claims in a press conference
 congress ne video item to banaae hai magar sarkaar ke banaae video item baari pad sakate hai
 Watch the video of the AAP government as well as the Congress, decide for yourself
 aapane dekha ki bijepi ke is video main ek banda he jo boxing kar rahaa he yani takat kaa pratik he
 He explains the success of the government with every punch
 isse pataa chalata he ki sarkaar khud ko bhi taqatvar balashaali rup main pesh karnaa chaahati he
 Like the Sakal newspaper has presented the Prime Minister as Bahubali
 aisa nahin he ki sarkari daavon ko media main chunauti nahin mil rahi he balki ve chunautiyaan pramukh jagah hasil nahin kar paati hai
 How many claims are made regarding electricity
 yah sector sarkaar kaa ek kaamyaab sector mana jaataa he
 But according to a website called indiaspend, the BJP government claims that 13,523 villages have been electrified in two years
 tippaniyan In 2015, the BJP government identified 18,452 villages, out of which 73% have access to electricity
 magar sarkaar ke hi aankade kehete hai ki inamen se maatr 8 pratishat gaanvon kaa hi sampurna vidyutikaran hua he yani in gaanvon ke sabhi gharon main bijli kaa conection pahunchaa he
 On the indiaspend site, it has been said that 25 percent of the rural families have not yet got electricity
 ek gaanv main agar skool, panchayat karyaalay or swasthya kendron ke alaava das pratishat gharon main bijli pahunchane par maan liya jaataa he ki us gaanv kaa vidyutikaran ho gaya
 Even if 90 percent of the households in a village do not have electricity, it is considered a village with electricity
 ho saktaa he ki ab sarkaar kii niti ho ki sabhi gharon ko bijli se joda jaae
 This is a policy review, but the government's success in distributing gas cylinders has not been criticized by the opposition either
 zaahir he ki aap moolyankan sirf aalochana se nahin kar sakate, sirf daavon se nahin kar sakate
 Do you think that the opposition will be able to surround the government with the question of employment, farmers' suicides
 slam yuva
 Slum youth is the youth who lives in slums
 isse pataa chalata he ki abhi tak jo yuva the saaf nahin tha ki ve slam yuva hai yaa posh yuva hai
 An analysis of the posters released on Twitter suggests that youth can be identified based on where they reside, apart from age
 is kaarykram kaa naam he slam yuva daud
 Adopt a slum means adopt a slum of Delhi
 isse yah saaf nahin he ki dilli ke ek slam ko koi god kaise le saktaa he, saansad god legaa, vidhayak god legaa yaa ye yuva hi apane slam ko god le lenge jisaki god main ye palate badhate hai
 However, under the auspices of Nehru Yuva Kendra, there was a race of slum youth, the crowd was considerable, the T-shirt also had a slum youth race
 sab kuch hindi main tha sirf slam angrezi main dikhaa
 Slum people could write
 in tasveeron se pataa chalata he ki hamaare slam yuva bhi dakshin dilli kii posh coloniyon main palane vaale yuvaaon jaise hi dikhte hai
 Nevertheless, this was a new idea and a good idea, if there is a shortage, Vijay Goyal is a liberal minister, he will improve
 slam god lene kii prerana shaayad adarsh gram yojana se lee gai hogi
 It was announced in October 2014 that every MP would adopt a village and make it ideal
 bhaajapa ke 281 saansad hai, us hisaab se teen saal baad 282 gaanvon ko adarsh rup main pesh kiya hi ja saktaa tha
 Seems like no one wants to talk to him anymore
 bat aneve
 If you want to shift from the original thing, then use butt anive in English
 kya aapane railway stesan par kursiyaan dekhi hai
 There are so few, more people keep staring at sitting than when they are not sitting, when we get up to sit
 samachar agency pitiai ne jab ye tasviir jari kii ki saansad hemamalini ne mathura railway stesan par kursiyon kaa udghaatan kiya he
 Seeing the picture, it would have been inaugurated, but saw it for the first time
 lekin jab hamane pataa kiya to hema malini ne acha kaam kiya he
 Mathura railway station is such a busy station
 kisi kaa dhyaan hi nahin gaya ki yatriyon ke baithne kii vyavastha honi chahie
 The pillars had a round seating system at the sides but Hema Malini has replaced it
 unhone vahaan par apane saansad nidhi se 100 bench lagava di he
 There are 40 benches on platform number one, 40 benches on platform number two and three and twenty benches on the rest
 abhi tak ham samajhate the ki railway hi stesan par bench kii vyavastha karti hogi, magar saansad nidhi kaa yah acha istemaal he
 The government is full of claims of its achievements, the opposition says that nothing has happened
 camel nishaan vaali bhaajapa ke netaa ek taraf uplabdhiyon ko lekar twitor se lekar bargad ke neeche khadey nazar aae to congress kii taraf se camel naam vaale kamalnath ne ginanaa shuru kar diya he ki 35 kisaan rose aatm hatya kar rahe hai
 Employment is at its lowest level in 7 years
 raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne guuruuvaar ko rajdhani dilli main yojit ramnath goyanka vyaakhyaan maala main phek news ke bare main chintaa jataai
 Said that the media's job is to question the government
 media apana mul kaam nahin kar rahaa he to log khush ho gaye hai ki raashtrapati ne ishaaron ishaaron main pradhanmantri or unki sarkaar par kataaksh kar diya he
 But in the Rashtrapati Bhavan on the day of Sarkarotsav, when the President released a book on Mann Ki Baat, the President also praised the communication skills communication skill of the Prime Minister
 kuch din pehle raashtrapati ne yah bhi kaha tha ki bhartiya itihaas kii indira gandhi sabase sweekrut pradhanmantri hai
 The Prime Minister is referring to Modi as an effective communicator and can also be compared to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi
 isi kaarykram ke dauraan raksha mantri or vitt mantri arun jetali ne bayaan diya ki pichley kuch saal se radio pichhadta ja rahaa tha lekin piem modi ne ek madhyam ke rup main radio kii takat ko pahachaanaa
 It is right to recognize the strength, but there may be different opinions about the fact that radio was lagging behind for the last few years
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki man kii baat ek anokhaa kaarykram he
 It is the first radio program that also appears on TV at the same time
 tivi par hi nahin, dilli main hi yah saare privet efem channelon par bhi aata he
 Whenever Mann Ki Baat is announced, no other program comes on any radio channel
 man kii baat kaa prasaaran doordarshan par bhi hota he
 Therefore, government TV, private channels, private FM channels should also be included in the analysis of the impact of Mann Ki Baat
 kya kisi or ke kaarykram ko efem channel apana kaarykram band kar suna sakate hai
 Yes, it can be said that the Prime Minister has changed TV to radio during Mann Ki Baat
 radio ke vikaas ke bare main fikki kepiemji apni salanaa report main jaankaree detii he
 The 2013 FICCI KPMG report stated that Radio 16 between 2012 and 2017
 6 pratishat kii growth rate se badhegaa
 The 2017 FICCI KPMG report stated that radio in 2016 had 14
 5 pratishat ke hisaab se hi growth rate hasil kii
 That is, the growth rate was lower by about two percent
 is vakt bharat ke 86 shaharon main 243 nijee radio channel chal rahe hai
 The radio sector was privatized in 2000, several hundred channels have been auctioned but only 243 are in operation
 fikki kepiemji kii report kahati he ki tisare charan kii nilaamee ko lekar khaasaa utsaah nahin dikhaa he
 Radios are also of many types
 digital radio, community radio
 Their progress should also be seen
 ab zaraa rajasav kaa angel dekh lete hai
 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) report of 15 March 2016 states that in 2014 the revenue of the radio sector grew by 18 percent compared to 2013, its revenue is expected to increase by 18 percent by 2019
 man kii baat se kamai or vigyaapan se hue kharche ko lekar hamaare paas koi swatantra jaankaree nahin he
 But we have got two news related to this in the archive of internet
 9 disambar 2016 ke live mint main chapa he ki loksabhaa main mantri rajyavardhan rathore ne likhit jawaab diya he ki 2015-16 main man kii baat se jo rajasav aayaa he wo 4 karod 78 lakh he
 RTI was quoted in Indian Express of August 5, 2015 as saying that only newspapers have spent eight and a half crores on advertisement of Mann Ki Baat
 aapane dekha ki rajasav aayaa 4 karod 78 lakh, vigyaapan par kharch hua kareeb dugana saadhe aath karod
 Live Mint has quoted sources as saying that more advertisements of Mann Ki Baat come from government advertisements
 loksabhaa main likhit jawaab dete hue mantri rajyavardhan rathod ne bataaya tha ki ol india radio kaa rajasav 2014-15 main 435
 1 crore
 2015-16 main 447
 6 crores
 to rajasav ke hisaab se bhi dekhiye to rajasav main maatr 12 karod 66 lakh kii vruddhi hui he
 There is no denying that radio has evolved
 hua he lekin man kii baat se kitna hua he kahana mushkil he
 Yes, Mann Ki Baat has been affected
 isse prabhavit hokar chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri ne bhi man kii baat jaisaa kaarykram karte hai
 Among the leaders of the opposition, Congress's Sandeep Dixit has started talking about work rather than Mann Ki Baat
 magar sandip dikshit kaa kaarykram radio kaa nahin he, video kaa he
 Very few people watch this video
 log kyon nahin dekhte hai ise aap bhi dekh lijie
 Our research on radio cannot be final
 jo public main he usee ke aadhaar par hamane prastut kiya he
 On the occasion of Sarkarotsav, we got an opportunity to do research on radio, for this, we welcome the statement of Jaitley ji in which he said that radio was lagging behind for the last few years
 sarkarotsav ke maukey par survey bhi anek prakaar ke hote hai
 There is good news for the government in these surveys
 zyaadaatar log santusht hai
 Are happy in survey ko lekar bhi kuch masti kii ja sakati he
 Survey of Dainik Bhaskar says that 52 percent people are angry with the way of demonetisation, 83 percent people are happy with the surgical strike
 angreji akhbaar times of india ke survey main 11 pratishat logon ne sargical strike ko mahatvapurn faisla mana he, 48 fisadi logon ne notebandi ke faisle ko mahatvapurn mana he
 Now look at the survey of newspaper in Hindi and English
 kitna antar he
 The Hindi public is happy with 83 percent surgical strikes
 angrezi kii janata sargical strike se zyada notebandi ko mahatvapurn faisla maanati he
 While 52 percent of the people of Hindi are angry with demonetisation
 to survey main bhi kaaphi mazedaar masala rahata he
 Now see, according to Bhaskar, 83 percent of the public is happy with the surgical strike
 bibisi ko bhi apane survey main 83 pratishat janata mili he jo sargical strike se nahin, phek news se pareshaan he
 According to the survey, 83 percent of Indian viewers watching the news are worried about fake news
 inamen se 72 pratishat ko pataa lagane main mushkil hoti he ki koun si khabar sahi he koun si managasaint khabar he
 Who are these people who participate in the survey? ye sawaal poochne vaale bhi bahut mil jate hai
 The anniversary opportunity becomes tense due to claims, i try to lighten up a bit
 ab dekhiye trump sahab kaa koi lenaa dena nahin he magar unke teen video ke zariye ham purush maansikta ke angan main jhaank sakate hai
 See in these two videos, Trump tries to hold his wife's hand, but inadvertently she shuts Trump's hand
 ab jab saikado camere lage hon to raashtrapati ko bura to laga hi hoga, lekin jab mauka aayaa to trump ne patni ke haath jhatakane kaa badla purush netaaon ke kandhe ko jhatka dekar le liya
 They were trailing on the stage, just pushed and came in front of everyone
 jo bhi ho, sarkaar ne apane tamaam daavon se media main chal rahi bheed kii marpet, saharanpur kii hinsa vagairah jaisi khabaron ko peeche kar diya he
 The success figures are being delivered in public space with utmost strength through statements and advertisements
 pradhanmantri modi ne assam main kaha bhi he ki yah pehle kii jaisi sarkaar nahin he ki kya ho rahaa he, kahaan ho rahaa he, kuch pataa hi nahin chalata tha
 In telling this, this government really has no match
 bataane main bhi or batiyaane main bhi
 But in the meantime, the general public of India is creating different kinds of discourse
 ek video aayaa jisamen alvar main sikh samudaay ke kuch logon ke saath marpet ho rahi he
 When this video went viral, the Minorities Commission of Rajasthan came into action
 in sikh bhaaiyon kaa kahana he ki ve sevadaar hai or lungar ke liye anaaj ikattha karne nikle the
 Asked for help from the people to save but no one came
 bheed aaraam se inhen peet kar bhaag gai
 The police got the information from the sarpanch of the village
 police ne is maamle main sevadaar par bhi shanti bhang karne kaa aarope laga diya
 The crowd does not know how to become a victim of which Hindus also become Muslims, and Muslims also become Sikhs
 isliye samasya us bheed ke bheetar he, shaayad isamen shaamil hone vaale yuvaaon kii bechainiyon ko ham thik se samaj nahin paa rahe hai
 By watching this video, do not understand that the public has turned against the Sikhs
 is tarah ke dibet to tivi par bhi nahin hue hai
 a news from the Times of India gives us another perspective
 ajay kii yah khabar he ki haryana ke noujvaan sena main naukari paane ke liye nakli tarah se sikh ban ja rahe hai
 This is not done by any one youth but 51 youths have done it
 sena ne pichley do saal main aise maamalon main 51 exiaar darj karai he
 Many soldiers from Haryana tried to call themselves Jat Sikhs so that the Sikh Regiment of the army could join
 baad main pataa chalaa ki ve sikh nahin hai
 This news says a lot
 rojgaar mahatvapurn he, mazahab nahin
 When we can leave the village, city and country for employment, what can be said about religion? is bich sarkaar ne apni ulabdhiyaan khud to bataai hi hai, media bhi sarkaar kii kamyaabi se kaaphi prabhavit lagata he
 The Sakal newspaper has shown Prime Minister Modi as Bahubali on one of its pages
 kai tivi channelon par pradhanmantri ko bahubali rup main dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 The newspaper has given three and a half points out of 5 to the Prime Minister, but the position of stepping on the elephant's forehead with the trunk indicates that he has conquered
 hathi ko saamne se pakad lenaa, veerta ke sarvocch udaahranon main se ek he
 The Prime Minister of the imagination of the media is now Bahubali
 sarkaar apane daawey majbooti se rakhti he
 It does not keep from one place but in different ways in many cities
 vipaksh apane daawey ek press conferes main rakhane ke baad chalaa jaataa he
 Congress has made video items but government made video items can be overwhelming
 aap sarkaar kaa bhi video dekhiye or congress kaa bhi, khud faisla kiijie
 You saw that in this video of BJP there is a man who is boxing, that is a symbol of strength
 wo har panch ke saath sarkaar kii kamyaabi ko bataata he
 This shows that the government also wants to present itself as a powerful force
 jaise sakaal akhbaar ne pradhanmantri ko bahubali ke rup main pesh kiya he
 It is not that the government claims are not being challenged in the media, rather they are not able to take the lead
 bijli ko lekar kitne daawey kiye jate hai
 This sector is considered to be a successful sector of the government
 lekin india spend naam kii ek website ke anusaar bijepi sarkaar daawa karti he ki do saal main 13,523 gaanvon kaa vidyutikaran kar diya gaya he
 The comments 2015 main bijepi sarkaar ne 18,452 gaanvon kii pahchaan kii thi, inamen se 73 fisadi main bijli pahunch gai he
 But the government's own statistics say that only 8 percent of these villages have been electrified, that is, electricity connection has reached all the houses in these villages
 india spend kii site par kaha gaya he ki 25 pratishat gramin pariwaron ke yahaan abhi tak bijli nahin pahunchi he
 In a village, if the electricity reaches ten percent of the homes, apart from schools, panchayat offices and health centers, it is assumed that the village has become electrified
 agar kisi gaanv ke 90 fisadi gharon main bijli na ho to bhi use bijli yukt gaanv maan liya jaataa he
 It may be the policy of the government that all houses be connected to electricity
 ye nitigat samiksha he, lekin gas silendar baantne main sarkaar kii kamyaabi kii vipaksh ne bhi aalochana nahin kii he
 It is obvious that you cannot evaluate with just criticism, but only by claims
 aapako lagata he ki rojgaar ke sawaal, kisaanon kii aatmahatya ke sawaal se vipaksh sarkaar ko gherne main kaamyaab rahegaa, sochiyegaa
 The motivation for slum adoption may have been derived from the Adarsh gram Yojana
 oktober 2014 main iskaa elaan hua tha ki har saansad ek gaanv god legaa or adarsh banayega
 The BJP has 281 mps, according to that 282 villages could have been projected as ideal after three years
 lagata he ab us par koi baat nahin karnaa chahta he
 Butt anway
 mul baat se shift hona ho to angrezi main bat aneve kaa istamaal karte hai
 Have you seen the chairs at the railway station? kitni kam hoti hai, jitne log baithe nahin hote hai usase zyada log baithe hue ko ghoorte rahete hai ki kab uthen ki ham baithen
 The news agency PTI released this picture when MP Hemamalini inaugurated the chairs at Mathura railway station
 tasviir dekhakar laga ki aisa udghaatan hota to hoga magar dekha pehali baar he
 But when we found out, Hema Malini did a good job
 mathura railway stesan itnaa vyast stesan he
 Nobody noticed that there should be seating arrangement for the passengers
 khambhon ke kinare gol gol baithne kaa system tha lekin hema malini ne ise badal diya he
 He has got 100 benches installed from his MP fund there
 platform number van par 40 bench, platform number do or teen par 40 bench or baaki par bees bench laga di he
 Till now we used to think that the railways would be arranging benches at the station, but this is a good use of MP fund
 sarkaar apni ulabdhiyon ke daavon se labalab he, vipaksh kahata he ki kuch hua hi nahin
 On the one hand, the leaders of the BJP bearing the lotus mark were seen standing on the tweeter, under the banyan, on the one hand, the Kamal Nath named Kamal has started counting from the Congress that 35 farmers are committing suicide every day

 President Pranab Mukherjee expressed concern about fake news at the Ramnath Goenka Lecture Series held in the capital Delhi on Thursday
 kaha ki media kaa kaam he sarkaar se sawaal karnaa
 If the media is not doing its basic work, people are happy that the President has made a sarcasm on the Prime Minister and his government in gestures
 magar sarkarotsav ke rose raashtrapati bhawan main jab man kii baat par ai ek kitaab ke vimochan main raashtrapati pradhanmantri ke sanchaar kaushal communication skill kii tarif bhi karne lage
 a few days ago the President also said that Indira Gandhi is the most accepted Prime Minister of Indian history
 pradhanmantri modi ke bare main kah rahe hai ki ve ek prabhavi communicator hai or unki tulana pandit jawahar laal nehru or indira gandhi se bhi kii ja sakati he
 During this program, Defense Minister and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made a statement that radio had been falling behind for the last few years but PM Modi recognized the power of radio as a medium
 takat pahchaanane kii baat sahi he lekin pichley kuch saal se radio pichhadta ja rahaa tha is baat ko lekar alag alag raay ho sakati he
 There is no doubt that Mann Ki Baat is a unique program
 yah pehla radio kaarykram he jo usee samay tivi par bhi aata he
 Not only on TV but in Delhi it also comes on all private FM channels
 jab bhi man kii baat kii ghoshnaa hoti he us dauraan kisi bhi radio channel par iske alaava koi kaarykram nahin aata he
 Mann Ki Baat is also broadcast on Doordarshan
 isliye man kii baat ke asar ke vishleshan main sarkari tivi, privet channel, privet efem channel ko bhi shaamil karnaa chahie
 Can anyone else listen to someone else's FM channel stop their program? haa ye kaha ja saktaa he ki pradhanmantri ne tivi ko man kii baat ke dauraan radio main badal diya he
 FICCI KPMG gives information about the development of radio in its annual report

 Will grow at a growth rate of 6 percent
 2017 kii fikki kepiemji report main kaha gaya ki 2016 main radio ne 14
 Achieved a growth rate of 5 percent
 yani anumaan se kareeb do pratishat vikaas dar kam rahi
 Currently, there are 243 private radio channels operating in 86 cities in India
 san 2000 main radio sector kaa nijeekaran hua tha, kai sau channel nilaam hue hai magar oparation main 243 hi hai
 a report by FICCI KPMG says that the third phase auction has not shown much enthusiasm
 radio bhi kai prakaar ke hai
 Digital Radio, Community Radio
 inaki pragati bhi dekhni chahie
 Now let's look at the angle of revenue
 telecom regulatory athurity of india (tiarai) kii 15 march 2016 kii report kahati he ki 2014 main radio sector kaa rajasav 2013 kii tulana main 18 pratishat badha tha, 2019 tak iske rajasav main 18 pratishat kii hi vruddhi hone kii ummid he
 We do not have any independent information about the earnings from advertising and expenses incurred by advertising
 magar isse sambandhit do khabaren hamen internet ke archive main mili hai
 On 9 December 2016, Live Mint featured that Rajya Vardhan Rathore, a minister in the Lok Sabha, gave a written reply that in 2015-16, the revenue that has come from Mann Ki Baat is 4 crore 78 lakh
 5 agast 2015 ke indian express main artiai ke hawaale se ek khabar chhapi he ki sirf akhbaaron main man kii baat ke vigyaapan par saadhe aath karod rupee kharch kiye hai
 You saw that the revenue came to 4 crores 78 lakhs, about eight and a half crores was spent on advertising
 live mint ne sutron ke hawaale se likhaa he ki man kii baat ko zyaada vigyaapan sarkari vigyapanon se aata he
 While giving a written reply in the Lok Sabha, Minister Rajyavardhan Rathore had said that the revenue of All India Radio was 435 in 2014-15
 1 karod tha
 447 in 2015–16
 6 karod tha
 If we look at the revenue as well, then the revenue has increased by only 12 crore 66 lakh
 is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki radio kaa vikaas hua he
 It has happened but it is difficult to say how much has happened with the mind
 haa man kii baat kaa asar hua he
 Impressed by this, the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh also performs programs like Mann Ki Baat
 vipaksh ke netaaon main congress ke sandip dikshit ne man kii baat ke mukaable kaam kii baat shuru kii he
 But Sandeep Dixit's program is not about radio, but of video
 is video ko bahut hi kam log dekhte hai
 Why do people not see it? radio par hamaari research antim nahin ho sakati
 We have presented on the basis of what is in public
 sarkarotsav ke maukey par radio par research karne kaa mauka mila iske liye ham jetali ji ke us bayaan kaa swaagat karte hai jisamen unhone kaha tha ki pichley kuch saal se radio pichhadta ja rahaa tha
 There are many types of surveys on the occasion of the government festival
 in survey main sarkaar ke liye kaaphi acchhee khabar he
 Most people are satisfied
 khush hai
 Some fun can also be done with these surveys
 dainik bhaskar kaa survey kahata he ki 52 fisadi log notebandi ke tareeke se naaraaz hai, 83 fisadi log sargical strike se khush hai
 In the survey of English newspaper Times of India, 11 percent considered surgical strike as an important decision, 48 percent considered the decision of demonetization
 ab hindi or angrezi ke akhbaar ke survey ko dekhiye
 What a difference
 hindi kii janata 83 fisadi sargical strike se khush he
 The English public considers demonetisation more important than surgical strikes
 jabaki hindi kii janata main 52 fisadi notebandi se naaraaz hai
 So there is a lot of fun spice in the survey as well
 ab dekhiye bhaskar ke anusaar 83 pratishat janata sargical strike se khush he
 The BBC has also received 83 per cent of the public in its survey, which is troubled by fake news, not surgical strikes
 survey ke anusaar 83 pratishat news dekhne vaale bharat ke darshak phek news ko lekar chintit hai
 72 percent of them find it difficult to find out which news is right and which is the fabricated news
 ye koun log hai jo survey main shaamil hote hai
 Those who ask these questions are also found very much
 saalagirah kaa mauka daawey pratidaave ke kaaran tanaav kaa ho jaataa he, meraa prayaas he ki kuch halkaa ho jaae
 Now see, Trump has nothing to do with him, but through his three videos, we can peep into the courtyard of male mentality
 in do video main dekhiye trump apni patni kaa haath thaamne kaa prayaas karte hai magar jane anjaane main wo trump kaa haath jhatak detii hai
 Now when the cameras are set to hundreds, the President must have felt bad, but when the opportunity came, Trump took the revenge for jerking his wife's hand by jerking the shoulder of the male leaders
 ve manch par peechad rahe the, bas dhakka diya or sabake saamne aa gaye
 In any case, the government has backtracked the news of media mob attacks, Saharanpur violence etc
 with all its claims
 puri majbooti ke saath kamyaabi ke aankade public spes main bayanon or vigyapanon ke zariye pahunchaae ja rahe hai
 Prime Minister Modi has also said in Assam that it is not like the previous government that what was happening, where it is happening, nothing was known
 jo bataane main is sarkaar kaa vaaki koi muqabla nahin he
 Both in telling and also in telling
 lekin is bich bharat kii aam janata alag alag tarah ke vimarsh kaa nirmaan kar rahi hoti he
 a video came in which some people of the Sikh community are being beaten up in Alwar
 yah video jab viral hua to rajasthan kaa alpsankhyak ayog harakat main aa gaya
 These Sikh brothers say that they are servicemen and had gone to gather grain for the langar
 logon se madad maangi ki bachaa lo magar koi nahin aayaa
 The crowd comfortably thrashed them and ran away
 police ko is ghatana kii soochna gaanv ke sarpanch se mili
 Police also accused Sevadar of breaching the peace in this case
 bheed pataa nahin kaise ban jaati he jiske shikaar hindu bhi ho jate hai, musalmaan bhi ho jate hai or sikh bhi ho gaye
 So the problem lies within that crowd, perhaps we are not able to understand the restlessness of the youth joining it
 is video ko dekhakar yah mat samaj lijiega ki janata sikhon ke khilaaf ho gai he
 Such debates have not even happened on TV
 times of india kii ek khabar hamen ek or nazariyaa detii he
 Ajay's news is that the youth of Haryana are becoming fake Sikhs to get a job in the army
 aisa kamaal kisi ek yuvak ne nahin balki 51 yuvakon ne kiya he
 The Army has filed 51 firs in such cases in the last two years
 haryana ke kai javaanon ne khud ko jet sikh bataane kii koshish kii taaki sena kii sikh regiment jwine kar sake
 It is later revealed that they are not Sikhs
 yah khabar kaaphi kuch kahati he
 Employment is important, not religion
 rojgaar ke liye jab ham gaanv shahar or desh chhod sakate hai to mazahab ko lekar kya kaha ja saktaa he
 Meanwhile, the government has stated its achievements on its own, the media too seems impressed by the success of the government
 sakaal akhbaar ne apane ek pej par pradhanmantri modi ko bahubali ke rup main dikhaaya he
 The Prime Minister is being shown as Bahubali on many TV channels
 akhbaar ne pradhanmantri ko 5 main se saadhe teen ank diye hai magar sundh se chadhate hue hathi ke mastak par paanv rakh dene kii mudra bataati he ki unhone vijay praapt kar lee he
 One of the highest examples of valor is to hold the elephant in front
 media ke janamanas kii kalpana ke pradhanmantri ab bahubali bhi hai
 The government keeps its claims firmly
 ek jagah se nahin rakhti balki kai shaharon main alag alag tareeke se rakhti he
 The opposition goes after putting their claims in a press conference
 congress ne video item to banaae hai magar sarkaar ke banaae video item baari pad sakate hai
 Watch the video of the AAP government as well as the Congress, decide for yourself
 aapane dekha ki bijepi ke is video main ek banda he jo boxing kar rahaa he yani takat kaa pratik he
 He explains the success of the government with every punch
 isse pataa chalata he ki sarkaar khud ko bhi taqatvar balashaali rup main pesh karnaa chaahati he
 Like the Sakal newspaper has presented the Prime Minister as Bahubali
 aisa nahin he ki sarkari daavon ko media main chunauti nahin mil rahi he balki ve chunautiyaan pramukh jagah hasil nahin kar paati hai
 How many claims are made regarding electricity
 yah sector sarkaar kaa ek kaamyaab sector mana jaataa he
 But according to a website called indiaspend, the BJP government claims that 13,523 villages have been electrified in two years
 tippaniyan In 2015, the BJP government identified 18,452 villages, out of which 73% have access to electricity
 magar sarkaar ke hi aankade kehete hai ki inamen se maatr 8 pratishat gaanvon kaa hi sampurna vidyutikaran hua he yani in gaanvon ke sabhi gharon main bijli kaa conection pahunchaa he
 On the indiaspend site, it has been said that 25 percent of the rural families have not yet got electricity
 ek gaanv main agar skool, panchayat karyaalay or swasthya kendron ke alaava das pratishat gharon main bijli pahunchane par maan liya jaataa he ki us gaanv kaa vidyutikaran ho gaya
 Even if 90 percent of the households in a village do not have electricity, it is considered a village with electricity
 ho saktaa he ki ab sarkaar kii niti ho ki sabhi gharon ko bijli se joda jaae
 This is a policy review, but the government's success in distributing gas cylinders has not been criticized by the opposition either
 zaahir he ki aap moolyankan sirf aalochana se nahin kar sakate, sirf daavon se nahin kar sakate
 Do you think that the opposition will be able to surround the government with the question of employment, farmers' suicides
 sarkaar apni ulabdhiyon ke daavon se labalab he, vipaksh kahata he ki kuch hua hi nahin
 On the one hand, the leaders of the BJP bearing the lotus mark were seen standing on the tweeter, under the banyan, on the one hand, the Kamal Nath named Kamal has started counting from the Congress that 35 farmers are committing suicide every day

 Said that the media's job is to question the government
 media apana mul kaam nahin kar rahaa he to log khush ho gaye hai ki raashtrapati ne ishaaron ishaaron main pradhanmantri or unki sarkaar par kataaksh kar diya he
 But in the Rashtrapati Bhavan on the day of Sarkarotsav, when the President released a book on Mann Ki Baat, the President also praised the communication skills communication skill of the Prime Minister
 kuch din pehle raashtrapati ne yah bhi kaha tha ki bhartiya itihaas kii indira gandhi sabase sweekrut pradhanmantri hai
 The Prime Minister is referring to Modi as an effective communicator and can also be compared to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi
 isi kaarykram ke dauraan raksha mantri or vitt mantri arun jetali ne bayaan diya ki pichley kuch saal se radio pichhadta ja rahaa tha lekin piem modi ne ek madhyam ke rup main radio kii takat ko pahachaanaa
 It is right to recognize the strength, but there may be different opinions about the fact that radio was lagging behind for the last few years
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki man kii baat ek anokhaa kaarykram he
 It is the first radio program that also appears on TV at the same time
 tivi par hi nahin, dilli main hi yah saare privet efem channelon par bhi aata he
 Whenever Mann Ki Baat is announced, no other program comes on any radio channel
 man kii baat kaa prasaaran doordarshan par bhi hota he
 Therefore, government TV, private channels, private FM channels should also be included in the analysis of the impact of Mann Ki Baat
 kya kisi or ke kaarykram ko efem channel apana kaarykram band kar suna sakate hai
 Yes, it can be said that the Prime Minister has changed TV to radio during Mann Ki Baat
 radio ke vikaas ke bare main fikki kepiemji apni salanaa report main jaankaree detii he
 The 2013 FICCI KPMG report stated that Radio 16 between 2012 and 2017

 The 2017 FICCI KPMG report stated that radio in 2016 had 14

 That is, the growth rate was lower by about two percent

 In telling this, this government really has no match

 But in the meantime, the general public of India is creating different kinds of discourse
 ek video aayaa jisamen alvar main sikh samudaay ke kuch logon ke saath marpet ho rahi he
 When this video went viral, the Minorities Commission of Rajasthan came into action

 The crowd does not know how to become a victim of which Hindus also become Muslims, and Muslims also become Sikhs

 This is not done by any one youth but 51 youths have done it
 sena ne pichley do saal main aise maamalon main 51 exiaar darj karai he
 Many soldiers from Haryana tried to call themselves Jat Sikhs so that the Sikh Regiment of the army could join

 This news says a lot
 rojgaar mahatvapurn he, mazahab nahin
 When we can leave the village, city and country for employment, what can be said about religion? is bich sarkaar ne apni ulabdhiyaan khud to bataai hi hai, media bhi sarkaar kii kamyaabi se kaaphi prabhavit lagata he
 The Sakal newspaper has shown Prime Minister Modi as Bahubali on one of its pages
 kai tivi channelon par pradhanmantri ko bahubali rup main dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 The newspaper has given three and a half points out of 5 to the Prime Minister, but the position of stepping on the elephant's forehead with the trunk indicates that he has conquered
 hathi ko saamne se pakad lenaa, veerta ke sarvocch udaahranon main se ek he
 The Prime Minister of the imagination of the media is now Bahubali
 sarkaar apane daawey majbooti se rakhti he
 It does not keep from one place but in different ways in many cities
 vipaksh apane daawey ek press conferes main rakhane ke baad chalaa jaataa he
 Congress has made video items but government made video items can be overwhelming
 aap sarkaar kaa bhi video dekhiye or congress kaa bhi, khud faisla kiijie
 You saw that in this video of BJP there is a man who is boxing, that is a symbol of strength
 wo har panch ke saath sarkaar kii kamyaabi ko bataata he
 This shows that the government also wants to present itself as a powerful force
 jaise sakaal akhbaar ne pradhanmantri ko bahubali ke rup main pesh kiya he
 It is not that the government claims are not being challenged in the media, rather they are not able to take the lead
 bijli ko lekar kitne daawey kiye jate hai
 This sector is considered to be a successful sector of the government
 lekin india spend naam kii ek website ke anusaar bijepi sarkaar daawa karti he ki do saal main 13,523 gaanvon kaa vidyutikaran kar diya gaya he
 The comments 2015 main bijepi sarkaar ne 18,452 gaanvon kii pahchaan kii thi, inamen se 73 fisadi main bijli pahunch gai he
 But the government's own statistics say that only 8 percent of these villages have been electrified, that is, electricity connection has reached all the houses in these villages
 india spend kii site par kaha gaya he ki 25 pratishat gramin pariwaron ke yahaan abhi tak bijli nahin pahunchi he
 In a village, if the electricity reaches ten percent of the homes, apart from schools, panchayat offices and health centers, it is assumed that the village has become electrified
 agar kisi gaanv ke 90 fisadi gharon main bijli na ho to bhi use bijli yukt gaanv maan liya jaataa he
 It may be the policy of the government that all houses be connected to electricity
 ye nitigat samiksha he, lekin gas silendar baantne main sarkaar kii kamyaabi kii vipaksh ne bhi aalochana nahin kii he
 It is obvious that you cannot evaluate with just criticism, but only by claims
 aapako lagata he ki rojgaar ke sawaal, kisaanon kii aatmahatya ke sawaal se vipaksh sarkaar ko gherne main kaamyaab rahegaa, sochiyegaa
 It is right to recognize the strength, but there may be different opinions about the fact that radio was lagging behind for the last few years
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki man kii baat ek anokhaa kaarykram he
 It is the first radio program that also appears on TV at the same time
 tivi par hi nahin, dilli main hi yah saare privet efem channelon par bhi aata he
 Whenever Mann Ki Baat is announced, no other program comes on any radio channel
 man kii baat kaa prasaaran doordarshan par bhi hota he
 Therefore, government TV, private channels, private FM channels should also be included in the analysis of the impact of Mann Ki Baat
 kya kisi or ke kaarykram ko efem channel apana kaarykram band kar suna sakate hai
 Yes, it can be said that the Prime Minister has changed TV to radio during Mann Ki Baat
 radio ke vikaas ke bare main fikki kepiemji apni salanaa report main jaankaree detii he
 The 2013 FICCI KPMG report stated that Radio 16 between 2012 and 2017

 But the government's own statistics say that only 8 percent of these villages have been electrified, that is, electricity connection has reached all the houses in these villages
 india spend kii site par kaha gaya he ki 25 pratishat gramin pariwaron ke yahaan abhi tak bijli nahin pahunchi he
 In a village, if the electricity reaches ten percent of the homes, apart from schools, panchayat offices and health centers, it is assumed that the village has become electrified
 agar kisi gaanv ke 90 fisadi gharon main bijli na ho to bhi use bijli yukt gaanv maan liya jaataa he
 It may be the policy of the government that all houses be connected to electricity
 ye nitigat samiksha he, lekin gas silendar baantne main sarkaar kii kamyaabi kii vipaksh ne bhi aalochana nahin kii he
 It is obvious that you cannot evaluate with just criticism, but only by claims
 aapako lagata he ki rojgaar ke sawaal, kisaanon kii aatmahatya ke sawaal se vipaksh sarkaar ko gherne main kaamyaab rahegaa, sochiyegaa
 We do not have any independent information about the earnings from advertising and expenses incurred by advertising
 magar isse sambandhit do khabaren hamen internet ke archive main mili hai
 On 9 December 2016, Live Mint featured that Rajya Vardhan Rathore, a minister in the Lok Sabha, gave a written reply that in 2015-16, the revenue that has come from Mann Ki Baat is 4 crore 78 lakh
 5 agast 2015 ke indian express main artiai ke hawaale se ek khabar chhapi he ki sirf akhbaaron main man kii baat ke vigyaapan par saadhe aath karod rupee kharch kiye hai
 You saw that the revenue came to 4 crores 78 lakhs, about eight and a half crores was spent on advertising
 live mint ne sutron ke hawaale se likhaa he ki man kii baat ko zyaada vigyaapan sarkari vigyapanon se aata he
 While giving a written reply in the Lok Sabha, Minister Rajyavardhan Rathore had said that the revenue of All India Radio was 435 in 2014-15
 1 karod tha
 447 in 2015–16
 6 karod tha
 If we look at the revenue as well, then the revenue has increased by only 12 crore 66 lakh 
 is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki radio kaa vikaas hua he
 It has happened but it is difficult to say how much has happened with the mind
 haa man kii baat kaa asar hua he
 Impressed by this, the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh also performs programs like Mann Ki Baat
 vipaksh ke netaaon main congress ke sandip dikshit ne man kii baat ke mukaable kaam kii baat shuru kii he
 But Sandeep Dixit's program is not about radio, but of video
 is video ko bahut hi kam log dekhte hai
 Why do people not see it? radio par hamaari research antim nahin ho sakati
 We have presented on the basis of what is in public
 sarkarotsav ke maukey par radio par research karne kaa mauka mila iske liye ham jetali ji ke us bayaan kaa swaagat karte hai jisamen unhone kaha tha ki pichley kuch saal se radio pichhadta ja rahaa tha
 There are many types of surveys on the occasion of the government festival
 in survey main sarkaar ke liye kaaphi acchhee khabar he
 Most people are satisfied
 khush hai
 Some fun can also be done with these surveys
 dainik bhaskar kaa survey kahata he ki 52 fisadi log notebandi ke tareeke se naaraaz hai, 83 fisadi log sargical strike se khush hai
 In the survey of English newspaper Times of India, 11 percent considered surgical strike as an important decision, 48 percent considered the decision of demonetization
 ab hindi or angrezi ke akhbaar ke survey ko dekhiye
 What a difference
 hindi kii janata 83 fisadi sargical strike se khush he
 The English public considers demonetisation more important than surgical strikes
 jabaki hindi kii janata main 52 fisadi notebandi se naaraaz hai
 So there is a lot of fun spice in the survey as well
 ab dekhiye bhaskar ke anusaar 83 pratishat janata sargical strike se khush he
 The BBC has also received 83 per cent of the public in its survey, which is troubled by fake news, not surgical strikes
 survey ke anusaar 83 pratishat news dekhne vaale bharat ke darshak phek news ko lekar chintit hai
 72 percent of them find it difficult to find out which news is right and which is the fabricated news
 ye koun log hai jo survey main shaamil hote hai
 Those who ask these questions are also found very much
 saalagirah kaa mauka daawey pratidaave ke kaaran tanaav kaa ho jaataa he, meraa prayaas he ki kuch halkaa ho jaae
 Now see, Trump has nothing to do with him, but through his three videos, we can peep into the courtyard of male mentality
 in do video main dekhiye trump apni patni kaa haath thaamne kaa prayaas karte hai magar jane anjaane main wo trump kaa haath jhatak detii hai
 Now when the cameras are set to hundreds, the President must have felt bad, but when the opportunity came, Trump took the revenge for jerking his wife's hand by jerking the shoulder of the male leaders
 ve manch par peechad rahe the, bas dhakka diya or sabake saamne aa gaye
 In any case, the government has backtracked the news of media mob attacks, Saharanpur violence etc
 with all its claims
 puri majbooti ke saath kamyaabi ke aankade public spes main bayanon or vigyapanon ke zariye pahunchaae ja rahe hai
 Prime Minister Modi has also said in Assam that it is not like the previous government that what was happening, where it is happening, nothing was known
 jo bataane main is sarkaar kaa vaaki koi muqabla nahin he
 Both in telling and also in telling
 lekin is bich bharat kii aam janata alag alag tarah ke vimarsh kaa nirmaan kar rahi hoti he
 a video came in which some people of the Sikh community are being beaten up in Alwar
 yah video jab viral hua to rajasthan kaa alpsankhyak ayog harakat main aa gaya
 These Sikh brothers say that they are servicemen and had gone to gather grain for the langar
 logon se madad maangi ki bachaa lo magar koi nahin aayaa
 The crowd comfortably thrashed them and ran away
 police ko is ghatana kii soochna gaanv ke sarpanch se mili
 Police also accused Sevadar of breaching the peace in this case
 bheed pataa nahin kaise ban jaati he jiske shikaar hindu bhi ho jate hai, musalmaan bhi ho jate hai or sikh bhi ho gaye
 So the problem lies within that crowd, perhaps we are not able to understand the restlessness of the youth joining it
 is video ko dekhakar yah mat samaj lijiega ki janata sikhon ke khilaaf ho gai he
 Such debates have not even happened on TV
 times of india kii ek khabar hamen ek or nazariyaa detii he
 Ajay's news is that the youth of Haryana are becoming fake Sikhs to get a job in the army
 aisa kamaal kisi ek yuvak ne nahin balki 51 yuvakon ne kiya he
 The Army has filed 51 firs in such cases in the last two years
 haryana ke kai javaanon ne khud ko jet sikh bataane kii koshish kii taaki sena kii sikh regiment jwine kar sake
 It is later revealed that they are not Sikhs
 yah khabar kaaphi kuch kahati he
 Employment is important, not religion
 rojgaar ke liye jab ham gaanv shahar or desh chhod sakate hai to mazahab ko lekar kya kaha ja saktaa he
 Meanwhile, the government has stated its achievements on its own, the media too seems impressed by the success of the government
 sakaal akhbaar ne apane ek pej par pradhanmantri modi ko bahubali ke rup main dikhaaya he
 The Prime Minister is being shown as Bahubali on many TV channels
 akhbaar ne pradhanmantri ko 5 main se saadhe teen ank diye hai magar sundh se chadhate hue hathi ke mastak par paanv rakh dene kii mudra bataati he ki unhone vijay praapt kar lee he
 One of the highest examples of valor is to hold the elephant in front
 media ke janamanas kii kalpana ke pradhanmantri ab bahubali bhi hai
 The government keeps its claims firmly
 ek jagah se nahin rakhti balki kai shaharon main alag alag tareeke se rakhti he
 The opposition goes after putting their claims in a press conference
 congress ne video item to banaae hai magar sarkaar ke banaae video item baari pad sakate hai
 Watch the video of the AAP government as well as the Congress, decide for yourself
 aapane dekha ki bijepi ke is video main ek banda he jo boxing kar rahaa he yani takat kaa pratik he
 He explains the success of the government with every punch
 isse pataa chalata he ki sarkaar khud ko bhi taqatvar balashaali rup main pesh karnaa chaahati he
 Like the Sakal newspaper has presented the Prime Minister as Bahubali
 aisa nahin he ki sarkari daavon ko media main chunauti nahin mil rahi he balki ve chunautiyaan pramukh jagah hasil nahin kar paati hai
 How many claims are made regarding electricity
 yah sector sarkaar kaa ek kaamyaab sector mana jaataa he
 But according to a website called indiaspend, the BJP government claims that 13,523 villages have been electrified in two years
 tippaniyan In 2015, the BJP government identified 18,452 villages, out of which 73% have access to electricity
 magar sarkaar ke hi aankade kehete hai ki inamen se maatr 8 pratishat gaanvon kaa hi sampurna vidyutikaran hua he yani in gaanvon ke sabhi gharon main bijli kaa conection pahunchaa he
 On the indiaspend site, it has been said that 25 percent of the rural families have not yet got electricity
 ek gaanv main agar skool, panchayat karyaalay or swasthya kendron ke alaava das pratishat gharon main bijli pahunchane par maan liya jaataa he ki us gaanv kaa vidyutikaran ho gaya
 Even if 90 percent of the households in a village do not have electricity, it is considered a village with electricity
 ho saktaa he ki ab sarkaar kii niti ho ki sabhi gharon ko bijli se joda jaae
 This is a policy review, but the government's success in distributing gas cylinders has not been criticized by the opposition either
 zaahir he ki aap moolyankan sirf aalochana se nahin kar sakate, sirf daavon se nahin kar sakate
 Do you think that the opposition will be able to surround the government with the question of employment, farmers' suicides
 loksabhaa main likhit jawaab dete hue mantri rajyavardhan rathod ne bataaya tha ki ol india radio kaa rajasav 2014-15 main 435
 1 crore
 2015-16 main 447
 6 crores
 to rajasav ke hisaab se bhi dekhiye to rajasav main maatr 12 karod 66 lakh kii vruddhi hui he
 There is no denying that radio has evolved
 hua he lekin man kii baat se kitna hua he kahana mushkil he
 Yes, Mann Ki Baat has been affected
 isse prabhavit hokar chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri ne bhi man kii baat jaisaa kaarykram karte hai
 Among the leaders of the opposition, Congress's Sandeep Dixit has started talking about work rather than Mann Ki Baat
 magar sandip dikshit kaa kaarykram radio kaa nahin he, video kaa he
 Very few people watch this video
 log kyon nahin dekhte hai ise aap bhi dekh lijie
 Our research on radio cannot be final
 jo public main he usee ke aadhaar par hamane prastut kiya he
 On the occasion of Sarkarotsav, we got an opportunity to do research on radio, for this, we welcome the statement of Jaitley ji in which he said that radio was lagging behind for the last few years
 sarkarotsav ke maukey par survey bhi anek prakaar ke hote hai
 There is good news for the government in these surveys
 zyaadaatar log santusht hai
 Are happy in survey ko lekar bhi kuch masti kii ja sakati he
 Survey of Dainik Bhaskar says that 52 percent people are angry with the way of demonetisation, 83 percent people are happy with the surgical strike
 angreji akhbaar times of india ke survey main 11 pratishat logon ne sargical strike ko mahatvapurn faisla mana he, 48 fisadi logon ne notebandi ke faisle ko mahatvapurn mana he
 Now look at the survey of newspaper in Hindi and English
 kitna antar he
 The Hindi public is happy with 83 percent surgical strikes
 angrezi kii janata sargical strike se zyada notebandi ko mahatvapurn faisla maanati he
 While 52 percent of the people of Hindi are angry with demonetisation
 to survey main bhi kaaphi mazedaar masala rahata he
 Now see, according to Bhaskar, 83 percent of the public is happy with the surgical strike
 bibisi ko bhi apane survey main 83 pratishat janata mili he jo sargical strike se nahin, phek news se pareshaan he
 According to the survey, 83 percent of Indian viewers watching the news are worried about fake news
 inamen se 72 pratishat ko pataa lagane main mushkil hoti he ki koun si khabar sahi he koun si managasaint khabar he
 Who are these people who participate in the survey? ye sawaal poochne vaale bhi bahut mil jate hai
 The anniversary opportunity becomes tense due to claims, i try to lighten up a bit
 ab dekhiye trump sahab kaa koi lenaa dena nahin he magar unke teen video ke zariye ham purush maansikta ke angan main jhaank sakate hai
 See in these two videos, Trump tries to hold his wife's hand, but inadvertently she shuts Trump's hand
 ab jab saikado camere lage hon to raashtrapati ko bura to laga hi hoga, lekin jab mauka aayaa to trump ne patni ke haath jhatakane kaa badla purush netaaon ke kandhe ko jhatka dekar le liya
 They were trailing on the stage, just pushed and came in front of everyone
 jo bhi ho, sarkaar ne apane tamaam daavon se media main chal rahi bheed kii marpet, saharanpur kii hinsa vagairah jaisi khabaron ko peeche kar diya he
 The success figures are being delivered in public space with utmost strength through statements and advertisements
 pradhanmantri modi ne assam main kaha bhi he ki yah pehle kii jaisi sarkaar nahin he ki kya ho rahaa he, kahaan ho rahaa he, kuch pataa hi nahin chalata tha
 In telling this, this government really has no match
 bataane main bhi or batiyaane main bhi
 But in the meantime, the general public of India is creating different kinds of discourse
 ek video aayaa jisamen alvar main sikh samudaay ke kuch logon ke saath marpet ho rahi he
 When this video went viral, the Minorities Commission of Rajasthan came into action
 in sikh bhaaiyon kaa kahana he ki ve sevadaar hai or lungar ke liye anaaj ikattha karne nikle the
 Asked for help from the people to save but no one came
 bheed aaraam se inhen peet kar bhaag gai
 The police got the information from the sarpanch of the village
 police ne is maamle main sevadaar par bhi shanti bhang karne kaa aarope laga diya
 The crowd does not know how to become a victim of which Hindus also become Muslims, and Muslims also become Sikhs
 isliye samasya us bheed ke bheetar he, shaayad isamen shaamil hone vaale yuvaaon kii bechainiyon ko ham thik se samaj nahin paa rahe hai
 By watching this video, do not understand that the public has turned against the Sikhs
 is tarah ke dibet to tivi par bhi nahin hue hai
 a news from the Times of India gives us another perspective
 ajay kii yah khabar he ki haryana ke noujvaan sena main naukari paane ke liye nakli tarah se sikh ban ja rahe hai
 This is not done by any one youth but 51 youths have done it
 sena ne pichley do saal main aise maamalon main 51 exiaar darj karai he
 Many soldiers from Haryana tried to call themselves Jat Sikhs so that the Sikh Regiment of the army could join
 baad main pataa chalaa ki ve sikh nahin hai
 This news says a lot
 rojgaar mahatvapurn he, mazahab nahin
 When we can leave the village, city and country for employment, what can be said about religion? is bich sarkaar ne apni ulabdhiyaan khud to bataai hi hai, media bhi sarkaar kii kamyaabi se kaaphi prabhavit lagata he
 The Sakal newspaper has shown Prime Minister Modi as Bahubali on one of its pages
 kai tivi channelon par pradhanmantri ko bahubali rup main dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 The newspaper has given three and a half points out of 5 to the Prime Minister, but the position of stepping on the elephant's forehead with the trunk indicates that he has conquered
 hathi ko saamne se pakad lenaa, veerta ke sarvocch udaahranon main se ek he
 The Prime Minister of the imagination of the media is now Bahubali
 sarkaar apane daawey majbooti se rakhti he
 It does not keep from one place but in different ways in many cities
 vipaksh apane daawey ek press conferes main rakhane ke baad chalaa jaataa he
 Congress has made video items but government made video items can be overwhelming
 aap sarkaar kaa bhi video dekhiye or congress kaa bhi, khud faisla kiijie
 You saw that in this video of BJP there is a man who is boxing, that is a symbol of strength
 wo har panch ke saath sarkaar kii kamyaabi ko bataata he
 This shows that the government also wants to present itself as a powerful force
 jaise sakaal akhbaar ne pradhanmantri ko bahubali ke rup main pesh kiya he
 It is not that the government claims are not being challenged in the media, rather they are not able to take the lead
 bijli ko lekar kitne daawey kiye jate hai

 The Sakal newspaper has shown Prime Minister Modi as Bahubali on one of its pages
 kai tivi channelon par pradhanmantri ko bahubali rup main dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 The newspaper has given three and a half points out of 5 to the Prime Minister, but the position of stepping on the elephant's forehead with the trunk indicates that he has conquered
 hathi ko saamne se pakad lenaa, veerta ke sarvocch udaahranon main se ek he
 The Prime Minister of the imagination of the media is now Bahubali
 sarkaar apane daawey majbooti se rakhti he
 It does not keep from one place but in different ways in many cities
 vipaksh apane daawey ek press conferes main rakhane ke baad chalaa jaataa he
 Congress has made video items but government made video items can be overwhelming
 aap sarkaar kaa bhi video dekhiye or congress kaa bhi, khud faisla kiijie
 You saw that in this video of BJP there is a man who is boxing, that is a symbol of strength
 wo har panch ke saath sarkaar kii kamyaabi ko bataata he
 This shows that the government also wants to present itself as a powerful force
 jaise sakaal akhbaar ne pradhanmantri ko bahubali ke rup main pesh kiya he
 It is not that the government claims are not being challenged in the media, rather they are not able to take the lead
 bijli ko lekar kitne daawey kiye jate hai
 This sector is considered to be a successful sector of the government
 lekin india spend naam kii ek website ke anusaar bijepi sarkaar daawa karti he ki do saal main 13,523 gaanvon kaa vidyutikaran kar diya gaya he
 The comments 2015 main bijepi sarkaar ne 18,452 gaanvon kii pahchaan kii thi, inamen se 73 fisadi main bijli pahunch gai he
 But the government's own statistics say that only 8 percent of these villages have been electrified, that is, electricity connection has reached all the houses in these villages
 india spend kii site par kaha gaya he ki 25 pratishat gramin pariwaron ke yahaan abhi tak bijli nahin pahunchi he
 In a village, if the electricity reaches ten percent of the homes, apart from schools, panchayat offices and health centers, it is assumed that the village has become electrified
 agar kisi gaanv ke 90 fisadi gharon main bijli na ho to bhi use bijli yukt gaanv maan liya jaataa he
 It may be the policy of the government that all houses be connected to electricity
 ye nitigat samiksha he, lekin gas silendar baantne main sarkaar kii kamyaabi kii vipaksh ne bhi aalochana nahin kii he
 It is obvious that you cannot evaluate with just criticism, but only by claims

 In any case, the government has backtracked the news of media mob attacks, Saharanpur violence etc
 with all its claims
 puri majbooti ke saath kamyaabi ke aankade public spes main bayanon or vigyapanon ke zariye pahunchaae ja rahe hai
 Prime Minister Modi has also said in Assam that it is not like the previous government that what was happening, where it is happening, nothing was known
 jo bataane main is sarkaar kaa vaaki koi muqabla nahin he
 Both in telling and also in telling
 lekin is bich bharat kii aam janata alag alag tarah ke vimarsh kaa nirmaan kar rahi hoti he
 a video came in which some people of the Sikh community are being beaten up in Alwar
 yah video jab viral hua to rajasthan kaa alpsankhyak ayog harakat main aa gaya
 These Sikh brothers say that they are servicemen and had gone to gather grain for the langar
 logon se madad maangi ki bachaa lo magar koi nahin aayaa
 The crowd comfortably thrashed them and ran away
 police ko is ghatana kii soochna gaanv ke sarpanch se mili
 Police also accused Sevadar of breaching the peace in this case
 bheed pataa nahin kaise ban jaati he jiske shikaar hindu bhi ho jate hai, musalmaan bhi ho jate hai or sikh bhi ho gaye
 So the problem lies within that crowd, perhaps we are not able to understand the restlessness of the youth joining it
 is video ko dekhakar yah mat samaj lijiega ki janata sikhon ke khilaaf ho gai he
 Such debates have not even happened on TV
 times of india kii ek khabar hamen ek or nazariyaa detii he
 Ajay's news is that the youth of Haryana are becoming fake Sikhs to get a job in the army
 aisa kamaal kisi ek yuvak ne nahin balki 51 yuvakon ne kiya he
 The Army has filed 51 firs in such cases in the last two years
 haryana ke kai javaanon ne khud ko jet sikh bataane kii koshish kii taaki sena kii sikh regiment jwine kar sake
 It is later revealed that they are not Sikhs
 yah khabar kaaphi kuch kahati he
 Employment is important, not religion
 rojgaar ke liye jab ham gaanv shahar or desh chhod sakate hai to mazahab ko lekar kya kaha ja saktaa he
 Meanwhile, the government has stated its achievements on its own, the media too seems impressed by the success of the government
 sakaal akhbaar ne apane ek pej par pradhanmantri modi ko bahubali ke rup main dikhaaya he
 The Prime Minister is being shown as Bahubali on many TV channels
 akhbaar ne pradhanmantri ko 5 main se saadhe teen ank diye hai magar sundh se chadhate hue hathi ke mastak par paanv rakh dene kii mudra bataati he ki unhone vijay praapt kar lee he
 One of the highest examples of valor is to hold the elephant in front
 media ke janamanas kii kalpana ke pradhanmantri ab bahubali bhi hai
 The government keeps its claims firmly
 ek jagah se nahin rakhti balki kai shaharon main alag alag tareeke se rakhti he
 The opposition goes after putting their claims in a press conference
 congress ne video item to banaae hai magar sarkaar ke banaae video item baari pad sakate hai
 Watch the video of the AAP government as well as the Congress, decide for yourself
 aapane dekha ki bijepi ke is video main ek banda he jo boxing kar rahaa he yani takat kaa pratik he
 He explains the success of the government with every punch
 isse pataa chalata he ki sarkaar khud ko bhi taqatvar balashaali rup main pesh karnaa chaahati he
 Like the Sakal newspaper has presented the Prime Minister as Bahubali
 aisa nahin he ki sarkari daavon ko media main chunauti nahin mil rahi he balki ve chunautiyaan pramukh jagah hasil nahin kar paati hai
 How many claims are made regarding electricity
 yah sector sarkaar kaa ek kaamyaab sector mana jaataa he
 But according to a website called indiaspend, the BJP government claims that 13,523 villages have been electrified in two years
 tippaniyan In 2015, the BJP government identified 18,452 villages, out of which 73% have access to electricity
 magar sarkaar ke hi aankade kehete hai ki inamen se maatr 8 pratishat gaanvon kaa hi sampurna vidyutikaran hua he yani in gaanvon ke sabhi gharon main bijli kaa conection pahunchaa he
 On the indiaspend site, it has been said that 25 percent of the rural families have not yet got electricity
 ek gaanv main agar skool, panchayat karyaalay or swasthya kendron ke alaava das pratishat gharon main bijli pahunchane par maan liya jaataa he ki us gaanv kaa vidyutikaran ho gaya
 Even if 90 percent of the households in a village do not have electricity, it is considered a village with electricity
 ho saktaa he ki ab sarkaar kii niti ho ki sabhi gharon ko bijli se joda jaae
 This is a policy review, but the government's success in distributing gas cylinders has not been criticized by the opposition either
 zaahir he ki aap moolyankan sirf aalochana se nahin kar sakate, sirf daavon se nahin kar sakate
 Do you think that the opposition will be able to surround the government with the question of employment, farmers' suicides
 ek video aayaa jisamen alvar main sikh samudaay ke kuch logon ke saath marpet ho rahi he
 When this video went viral, the Minorities Commission of Rajasthan came into action

 Like the Sakal newspaper has presented the Prime Minister as Bahubali

 How many claims are made regarding electricity
 yah sector sarkaar kaa ek kaamyaab sector mana jaataa he
 But according to a website called indiaspend, the BJP government claims that 13,523 villages have been electrified in two years
 tippaniyan In 2015, the BJP government identified 18,452 villages, out of which 73% have access to electricity
 magar sarkaar ke hi aankade kehete hai ki inamen se maatr 8 pratishat gaanvon kaa hi sampurna vidyutikaran hua he yani in gaanvon ke sabhi gharon main bijli kaa conection pahunchaa he
 On the indiaspend site, it has been said that 25 percent of the rural families have not yet got electricity
 ek gaanv main agar skool, panchayat karyaalay or swasthya kendron ke alaava das pratishat gharon main bijli pahunchane par maan liya jaataa he ki us gaanv kaa vidyutikaran ho gaya
 Even if 90 percent of the households in a village do not have electricity, it is considered a village with electricity
 ho saktaa he ki ab sarkaar kii niti ho ki sabhi gharon ko bijli se joda jaae
 This is a policy review, but the government's success in distributing gas cylinders has not been criticized by the opposition either
 zaahir he ki aap moolyankan sirf aalochana se nahin kar sakate, sirf daavon se nahin kar sakate
 Do you think that the opposition will be able to surround the government with the question of employment, farmers' suicides
 yah khabar kaaphi kuch kahati he
 Employment is important, not religion
 rojgaar ke liye jab ham gaanv shahar or desh chhod sakate hai to mazahab ko lekar kya kaha ja saktaa he
 Meanwhile, the government has stated its achievements on its own, the media too seems impressed by the success of the government

 One of the highest examples of valor is to hold the elephant in front
 media ke janamanas kii kalpana ke pradhanmantri ab bahubali bhi hai
 The government keeps its claims firmly
 ek jagah se nahin rakhti balki kai shaharon main alag alag tareeke se rakhti he
 The opposition goes after putting their claims in a press conference
 congress ne video item to banaae hai magar sarkaar ke banaae video item baari pad sakate hai

 aap sarkaar kaa bhi video dekhiye or congress kaa bhi, khud faisla kiijie
 You saw that in this video of BJP there is a man who is boxing, that is a symbol of strength
 wo har panch ke saath sarkaar kii kamyaabi ko bataata he
 This shows that the government also wants to present itself as a powerful force
 jaise sakaal akhbaar ne pradhanmantri ko bahubali ke rup main pesh kiya he
 It is not that the government claims are not being challenged in the media, rather they are not able to take the lead

 It may be the policy of the government that all houses be connected to electricity

 amit shah ko 2005 ke soharabuddin shaikh farji encounter maamle main sah-aaropee ke rup main july 2010 main jail kii sajaa hui, to aisa laga jaise narendra modi par bijli gir gai ho
 During Shah's three months in jail, those visiting Narendra Modi's house or Daktar realized that he was not the former Modi
 lagata tha, jaise modi besahaara ho gaye hai
 There are reports that the Congress is luring Shah to change his face and plotting to implicate Modi
 pareshaan mukhyamantri ne apane salaahkaaron se mashvira kiya ki aakhir shah ko jail se baahar kaise nikaala jaae
 On the other hand, Shah gave a message of complete confidence from jail that no matter how much pressure is there, he will never do anything that will harm Modi
 jail ke ye kuch maheene modi or amit shah ke bich duuri ke shaayad sabase lambii avadhi ke the
 It is also a proof that their three decades long partnership has stood the test of all kinds
 shah modi ke us maharath ke sarathi the, jisane congress ko 2014 main 44 siton tak simata diya or teen dashakon ke baad pehali baar kisi rajnatik dal ko sansad main purna bahumat mila
 After this, this veteran duo pushed the BJP to 13 states, by winning elections directly or forming coalition governments in the states
 isamen pichley saal kii shuruyaat main uttar pradesh jaise rajya main satta kaa bada uphaar or haal main himachal pradesh kii jeet shaamil he
 The Congress's power reduced to five states has been the smallest in the last two decades on the political map of the country
 rajnatik vishleshak japan pathak kehete hai ki congress to himachal pradesh main paanch saal ke anti inakambency se nibatane main vifal rahi, lekin modi-shah kii jodi ne do dashak kii anti inakambency ke baad bhi gujarat main jeet chhinakar apane paale main kar lee
 shah-modi's relationship began to ripen in the early eighties under the umbrella of his ideological family, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 modi sangh main prachaarak the to amit shah ek junior kaaryakarta
 In 1984, when Modi became a district pracharak in Ahmedabad and Shah a BJP worker, the relationship became stronger
 sangh parivaar ke vaicharik manthan vaale satron main amit shah kii jwalanth masalon kii saaf samaj, unki vaicharik patibaddhta or pechida masalon kaa vishleshan kar paane kii unki pratibha ko dekhakar modi kaaphi prabhavit the
 However, their joining together in 1986 was a natural process
 modi tab tak gujarat bhaajapa ke purnakalik sanghathan mantri ban chuke the or unhone chunaavon ke dauraan booth management jaise chote rajnatik kaaryon main shah ko lagaana shuru kiya
 Modi was impressed by this young party worker's understanding of politics and strategic thinking
 jab 1996 main ve gujarat ke purv mukhyamantri keshubhai patel se alag hue, to shah ne modi kaa saath diya
 After this, when Modi started his election innings as the Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001, Shah rose
 tab mahaj 38 saal ke amit shah desh main rajyon ke sabase yuva mantriyon main se ek the or 2004 main modi mantrimandal main unke paas 17 vibhaag the
 However, their relationship has never been equal
 umr or varishthata ke aadhaar par modi bos jaise rahe to shah unke vafaadaar shishy
 Shah never rejected it, even he always called Modi as Saheb
 is nishtha ke alaava shah kii kushaagratha, rajnatik sooyeeboojh or in sabase upar raajnneeti yaa prashasan main modi ke dimag ko bilkul sahi tareeke se pard paane kii kshamta ne unhen pradhanmantri ke liye aprihaary bana diya he
 "they complement each other," says Vidyut Thakkar, a political analyst based in Ahmedabad
 modi swapndarshi hai to shah usko lagu karne vaale
 "to put it another way, Modi is the brand and Shah is his marketing master
 unhone chunaav ladgaye or jeetne kii kala ko ek sateek vigyaan main badal diya he
 He used to paste party posters in the 1985 Gujarat assembly elections
 iske bare main ve khud bataate hai, ''sirf bhaajapa main hi yah ho saktaa he ki mere jaisaa vyakti jisane kabhi yuva avasthaa main party ke chunaav poster chipkaae hon, vah uskaa rashtriya adhyaksh ban jaae
 "always keen to learn something, Shah is the only person who molded Modi's lessons in the style of elections, used it in three consecutive assembly elections in Gujarat and the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
" sitambar 2014 main unke party adhyaksh banane ke baad se bhaajapa ke ek ke baad ek vidhansabha chunaav jeetne kaa silsilaa tuutata hi nahin najar aa rahaa he
 The duo's synergy is absolutely perfect in terms of strategy and moving forward
 pichley saal upi chunaav ke antim charan main shah har shaam modi ko phone karte the or bilkul kartavyanishtha ke saath din bhar ke ghatnakram kii jaankaree modi ko dete the, kisi chunavi raily main kam bheed se lekar koi seat jeetne kii kitni sambhaavna he, isaki jaankaree tak
 In Gujarat, Shah immediately predicted a worsening of the situation when people started joining him after Hardik Patel accused the BJP of dictatorship
 iske baad is diggaj jodi ne yah tay kiya ki ab zyada vinamr modi kii chhavi ko project karnaa hoga
 In the last phase of the election campaign, Modi shook the public's sense of Gujarati identity, bowed before him as a son of Gujarati soil, as a son whom the state could trust and who drove the brokers out of Delhi to Gujarat Proud to have
 isaki vajah se hi shaayad bhaajapa saurashtra main apana garh ujadgaye se bachaa pai
 On most issues, both have the same thinking
 pichley saal is jodi ne yah tay kiya ki bhaajapa ko kis tarah se ek alag tarah kii party ke rup main project karnaa he
 For this, the state BJP units were instructed to accept donations only through checks, even if the donation was Rs
 kaa ho yaa ek karod ru
 Of
 iske peeche yah sunishchit karne kii soch bhi thi ki chanda sangrah abhiyaan ke jariye rajya ikaiyaan ek nidhi taiyaar kar saken, taaki is nidhi par milane vaale byaaj se unka kharch chal sake
 This attempt to bring transparency in the day-to-day functioning of the BJP is in line with the ideals of Deendayal Upadhyay, an icon of the RSS-BJP
 party ke mahasachiv bhupendra yadav kehete hai, ''ve ek-duusare ko bahut acchhee tarah samajhate hai
 Such mutual understanding is rare
 ''haalanki shah ne pichley saal agast main jis tarah kii todfod kii raajnneeti kii, usko lekar kuch asahmati bhi he
 He tried to defeat 13 Congress mlas in his court to defeat Congress leader Ahmed Patel in the Rajya Sabha elections
 unka yah kadam us saaf chhavi ke vipareet tha jo modi ne pichley teen saal main pradhanmantri ke rup main bahut mehnat se taiyaar kii he
 Not only did Ahmed Patel win the election, but six of the seven sitting Congress mlas who were given tickets by Shah lost the assembly elections
 is puure prakaran ne bhaajapa kii chhavi kharaab kii he or congress ko haaavee hone kaa mauka diya
 Amit Shah, who became a Rajya Sabha MP in October this year, has also contributed extensively to many public welfare schemes of the Modi government
 shah kaa hi yah suzav tha ki sabhi mantralay apni jarurat kaa kapadaa khaadi gramodyog ayog se khariden
 Shah also has a team that oversees the performance and functioning of Union ministers and his opinion is of great importance to Modi in appointments to the CBI and other politically sensitive organizations

 In such a situation, along with Haryana, the eyes of the country are also fixed on the seat of Bhupendra Singh Hooda
 hooda jat bahulya rohtak jile kii gadhi saanpala nangaloi vidhansabha seat se maidan main hai, jahaan unhen takkar dene ke liye bhaajapa ne indian neshnal lokdal (inelo) chhodkar kuch hi samay purv party main shaamil hue pradeep kumaar nandal ko ummidavaar banaaya he
 This seat came into existence after the delimitation of 2009
 gadhi saanpala kiloi seat, kiloi or hasangarh (purana naam saanpala) vidhansabha siton ko milakar astitv main ai
 Hooda's father was also an MLA
 In the first election held in 1967 after the formation of the state, Ranbir Singh Hooda, father of freedom fighter and Bhupendra Singh Hooda, who was a member of the Constituent Assembly, contested from the Kiloi seat on a Congress ticket
 tab asthal bohar math ke mahant shreyonath ne math ke prati logon kii aasthaa ko bhunaate hue hooda ko shikast de di thi
 a year later in 1968, mid-term elections were held and Mahant Shreyonath was defeated by Ranbir Singh Hooda
 is seat par 1972 main bhupendra singh hooda ke bhai pratap singh hooda ne chunaav ladaa or haar gaye
 Hoodasasan lost the initial election in the 1977 election when his father Ranbir came to the ground again and after a bitter defeat, he became disillusioned with the politics of the state

 However, Bhupendra Singh Hooda also lost from the Kiloi seat in both the early elections in 1982 and 1987
 1982 main unhen lokdal ke harichand, to 1987 memlokadal ke hi shrikrishna hooda ne bhupendra hooda ko shikast di thi
 Krishnamurthy Hooda waved Congress's victory in the aftermath of the 1967 Assembly elections, breaking the order of successive defeats of Congress
 krishnamurthi ne tab nivartmaan vidhayak or janata dal ke ummidavaar shrikrishna ko haraaya tha
 In 1996, Srikrishna Hooda won Vijayashree in the election on the ticket of Social Action Party and Krishnamurthy Hooda finished third

 Pradeep Kumar Nandal will be able to feed Kamal? Pradeep Kumar Nandal was national spokesperson of INLD, Omprakash Chautala's party, who was recognized as an influential leader in Haryana politics before joining BJP
 nandal ne inelo ke tikat par 2009 or 2014 main bhi hooda ko chunavi chunauti di thi
 However, both of them had to face severe defeat
 is baar vah sattadhari bhaajapa ke tikat par gadhi saanpala kiloi seat se hooda ke khilaaf taal thok rahe hai
 In such a situation, it will have to be seen whether he will be able to defeat Lotus by defeating Bhupendra Singh Hooda, who has held the top seat of the state for 10 years, which Hooda's father has also represented in the assembly

 a senior official aware of the correspondence between India and Pakistan in the case said that in response to India's demand for fresh investigation into the 2008 case and prosecution of jamaat-ud-dawa chief Hafiz Saeed, Pakistan said That the trial has now reached a decisive stage
 adhikari ne kaha, sabhi kaarywahi maamle main tay kii ja chuki hai, sivaay 24 bhartiya gavaahon ke bayaan darj hone ke
 It is not possible to re-examine in this situation
 bharat agar is maamle kaa parinaam chahta haito use apane gavaahon ko bayaan darj karwaane ke liye pakistan bhejnaa chahie
 Saeed and four of his associates have been under house arrest in Lahore since January 30 under Pakistan's anti-terrorism law
 said ke sir par aatankwaad se judi gatividhiyon main uski bhoomika ke liye america ne ek karod dollar kaa inaam ghoshit kar rakhaa he
 The Jamaat-ud Dawa chief was earlier under house arrest even after the Mumbai attack
 haalanki 2009 main uske khilaaf saakshyon ke abhaav main use ek adaalat ne bari kar diya
 Pakistan has demanded concrete evidence from India to prosecute her in this case

 in) onsep 28, 2019 at 12:20 am PDT jab tak satta main rahe to kabhi bhi jail ke halaat ke bare main nahin sochaa or ab jab vah devgarh chaara ghotaale maamle main jail main sajaa kaat rahe hai, to unhen vahaan ek ke baad dikkatein dikhaai de rahi hai jisaki shikaayat court main kar rahe hai
 Between 1990 and 1994, there is a blame for illegally extracting 89 lakh, 27 thousand rupees in the name of animal feed from Deoghar treasury
 tab lalu yadav hi bihar ke mukhyamantri the
 However, this entire fodder scam is worth Rs 950 crore, out of which one case related to Deoghar Treasury
 lalu kii daleelenlalu ab jail main hai or vah vakil ke sahare jaj sahab se anurodh kar rahe hai ki unhen sajaa kam di jaae kyonki jail main wo suvidhaayen nahin hai, jiske vah abhyast rahe hai
 However, in the fodder scam case, no punishment was announced on Friday
 abyah sajaa shanivaar ko dopaher sunai jaaegi
 The special thing is that in order to get a lesser punishment, he himself and his lawyers are presenting such arguments one after another on which one can only laugh
 agar unhone satta main rahane ke dauraan in kamiyon ko dur karne kii koshish kii hoti to aaj unhen yah shikaayat nahin kerani padati
 Know what their complaints are about jail
 lalu bole- mujhe kidney kii beemaarigel ko lekar lalu kii shikaayatein khatm nahin ho rahi thi
 On Friday, Lalu appeared in court through video conferencing before the court's decision
 lalu kii taraf se vakeelon ne kam sajaa dilaane ke liye kuch or bahaane kiye
 The plea submitted by the lawyer said that he has kidney disease, is a patient of diabetes and has also had a heart operation
 isliye unhen kam se kam sajaa di jaae
 How to handle RJD in Lalu's absence, Tejaswijel does not get pure; maybe the lawyers felt that the case was not being made, so now they started to complain about the disorder of the jail
 vakeelon kii agal daleel thi, birsa munda jail main infections hone kaa dar he isliye unke swasthya ko dekhte hue unhen kam sajaa di jaae
 The most unique argument from his side was that the jail does not have a system of pure water, so his kidney may be affected
 jail main bahut thandaisse pehle ranchi sthit vishesh sibiai adaalat se rashtriya janata dal (argedy) adhyaksh lalu yadav ne us samay shikaayat kii kisel main thand bahutahai jab jaj ne unase poocha ki koi dikkat to nahin he
 Hearing Lalu's answer, the judge said, then play tabla
 jaj shivpal singh ne lalu prasad kii ore ishaara kar karte hue ek or sawaal poocha, "jail main koi dikkat to nahin?" jawaab main lalu ne kaha, "sahab jail main mere parichiton ko mujhase milane nahin diya ja rahaa he
 "to which the judge said," That is why we call you in court so that you can meet everyone
 "teen talaak kaa virodh aakhir kyon?ab shanivaar ko yah faisla aayega
 Lalu's lawyer Chittaranjan Prasad said that if Lalu and others are convicted in this case, they will face a maximum sentence of imprisonment of 7 years and minimum of 1 year
 jabaki sibiai adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki is maamle main gaban kii dhara 409 ke tahat 10 saal or dhara 467 ke tahat aaajeevan karawas kii bhi sajaa ho sakati he
 If Lalu is sentenced to a sentence of less than 3 years, he can get bail immediately, while for this, the lawyers will have to approach the High Court for bail

 However, the audience waited for two years to know this question
 is baat ko jaanane kii sabhi ko itani betaabi thi ki varking de hone ke baavjood tamaam cinemagharon main pehle sho hi housephul the
 In the Hindi-speaking audiences, such craze is usually seen by the Khan trio
 haul main pair rakhte hi darshakon kaa utsaah dekhakar koi nahin kah saktaa tha ki yah ek aisi film he, jisamen north belt main apni majboot pakad rakhane vaala koi star nahin he
 For the Prabhas, which people did not even recognize until two years ago, they were taking tickets and playing whistles and applause by putting lines

 Many hands were wiping their eyes at scenes such as mother Shivagami's son Bahu being removed from the palace and Kattappa's sword in the heart of a dearly loved nephew
 or thami rahi darshakon kii saansenfilmon main kai seen aise bhi hai jo darshakon ko hairaan kar dete hai
 And while tying it, even in the blink of an eye, one feels that something will be missed
 clymex aisa jaandaar he ki hollywood filmon ke chakke chhudaa die hai
 Bahubali has given a befitting reply to those who praise Bollywood films simply by calling them superficial
 film se ek khaas conection tab bhi mahasoos hota he jab iske posters ko aap screen par live hote dekhte hai
 Bahubali climbed on the elephant trunk, the royal form of Devasena, the movement of Bahu and Devasena together

 It is a matter of the freedom struggle, when Mahatma Gandhi came to the secondary school of Sinhapur Bada in Narsinghpur district
 unke aane kaa is vidhyalay par aisa asar padaa ki yahaan ke chaatro ne gandhi topi ko hi apni dress kaa hissaa bana liya
 The trend continues even today and every student of this school does not forget to come with a white shirt, blue pants and a Gandhi cap on his head

 vidhyalay ke chaatr durgesh uike kaa kahana he ki unhone gandhi ko to nahin dekha he magar gandhi topi lagane se unhen unki yaad jarur aa jaati he
 They want their conduct to be like Gandhi's and they can do something for the country
 chaatr raseed khan kehete hai ki gandhi topi lagaakar unhen fakr mahasoos hota he
 This hat gives them new energy, they forget any work they need but do not forget to put a hat on when they come to school
 mahatma gandhi ke aane ke baad se shuru hui vidhyaarthiyon ke gandhi topi lagane kii parampara aaj bhi kaayam he or ummid karte hai ki yah aage bhi jari rahe, taaki gandhi ke anuyaayi hone kaa daawa karne vaale bhi kuch sikh len

 The Supreme Court said that why do not you make your side clear whether you support the ban on those who get punishment for life elections? supreme court ne kaha ki aapane apane halafanaame main kaha ki aap yachika kaa samarthan karte ho ? lekin abhi sunwaayee ke dauraan aap kah rahe ho ki aapane bas raajnneeti se apradheekaran kii mukti ko lekar samarthan kiya he

 sarkaar ne kaha ki sanvaidhanik court ko tabhi dakhal dena chahie ki jab kisi janhit ke maamle main vidhayika ne kaam na kiya ho
 There are already legal provisions
 sarkaar ne kaha ki yah masalaa nyaayik pareekshan ke daayre se baahar he
 There is already a constitutional and legal provision for disqualification of mps and mlas, in such a situation that further prohibition on disqualification is not appropriate
 maujuuda praavdhaan ke mutabik, agar netaa ko doshi tehraaya jaataa he or use do yaa usase adhik varsh kii sajaa hoti he to us par sajaa puri karne ke chah varsh baad tak chunaav ladgaye par pabandi he

 Bollywood actress Katrina Kaif has worn the praises of her boy friend Ranbir Kapoor's father Rishi Kapoor and she considers him a living legend
 katrina ne kaha, main rishi ji ke saath kaam kar chuki hum or mere prati unka vyavhaar atyadhik namr rahaa
 i believe he is amazing and charming
 vah jivit kinvadanti hai or jab main unhen dekhati hum to mujhe prasannataa hoti he
 Katrina and Ranbir started dating each other in 2009 during the shooting of the film 'ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani'
 donon ke ibija main chuttee manaane ke photo 2013 main viral ho gaye the, jisase donon ke bich sambandhon kii pushti hui thi
 Although the two actors often appear with each other, they have not spoken a word about their relationship
 kapur khandaan ke prati judaav rakhane vaali 32 varshiya katrina parivaar kii badi prashansak hai
 The comments unhone kaha, hamane ek-duusare ke saath zyada samay nahin bitaayaa he, kyonki har koi apane kaam main vyast he
 i love everyone and i respect everyone
 shaadi ke bare main puche jane par ‘dhooma 3’ star ne kaha, shaadi kii abhi koi yojana nahin he

 She will next be seen in Kabir Khan's 'phantom' opposite Saif Ali Khan
 katrina ne kaha ki unhen nahin pataa ki vyavsaayik jindagi kii jagah unki nijee jindagi khabaron main kyon zyada rahati he? Katrina said, i have worked with Rishi ji and his behavior towards me was very humble

 She is a living legend and i am delighted when i see her
 katrina or ranbir ne 2009 main ‘ajab prem kii gajab kahani’ film kii shooting ke dauraan ek-duusare ke saath dating shuru kii thi
 Photos of the two celebrating their holiday in Ibiza went viral in 2013, confirming the relationship between the two
 haalanki donon kalakaar aksar ek-duusare ke saath dikhte hai, lekin unhone apane sambandhon ke bare main ek shabd nahin bolaa he
 The 32-year-old, who has an affinity for the Kapoor family, is a big fan of the Katrina family
 tippaniyan He said, we have not spent much time with each other, because everyone is busy with their work
 meraa har kisi se lagaav he or main prayek kaa sammaan karti hum
 When asked about the wedding, the 'dhoom 3' star said, there is no plan of marriage yet
 mujhe nahin pataa ki log hamaare liye is jaldbaaji main kyon hai ki ham (ranbir or main) shaadi kar len
 Marriage will happen for both of us at the right time
 vah agali film kabir khan kii ‘phantum’ main saf ali khan ke saath dikhengi

 janata dal (united) kii gujarat ikai ne shanivaar ko kaha ki narendra modi ke gujarat ke mukaable nitish kumaar ke shashan vaala bihar adhik surakshit jagah he
 JDU Gujarat vice president Gopal Jadhav said that Bihar is a safer place than Gujarat
 gujarat sarkaar logon ke paise kaa durupyog kar rahi he or rajya sarkaar dwaara shuru kii gayi vikaas pariyojnaon kaa laabh dur-daraaj ke kshetra main rahane vaale logon ko abhi tak nahin mil paa rahaa he
 Jadhav said that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had about 1 of the army
 5 lakh sevanivrutt javaanon or police adhikariyon ko rajya main shanti behaal karne ke liye bhartee kiya he jabaki gujarat main vidhayak nirnay lene ke liye swatantra nahin hai or loktantr 'gaayab ho rahaa' he
 BJP president Amit Shah will arrive in Patna on Thursday, amid differences over seat-sharing between NDA allies in Bihar in next year's Lok Sabha elections
 shah jediu adhyaksh or siem nitish kumaar ke saath mulaakaat karenge
 It is believed that through this, the formula to bring the relationship between the two parties back on track and contest elections together in 2019 can be decided
 bataa den ki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah in dinon loksabhaa main party kii taiyaari or majbootee ke saath-saath sahyogi dalon saadhane ke liye desh bhar main daura kar rahe hai
 Shah's Bihar tour is also considered part of this
 amit shah guuruuvaar subah 10 baje patna ke lokanayak jaiprakash narayan airport pahunchenge, jahaan bihar bijepi ikai ke netaa unka swaagat karenge
 Shah will then proceed directly to the guesthouse, where Nitish Kumar and the party will have breakfast with senior leaders
 shah ke bihar daure se pehle bijepi netaa vakendriya mantri giriraaj singh ne ramvanami main hone vaale dangon ke aaropeebajrang dal ke zila sanyojak jitendra pratap jitu or vishwa hindu parishad ke jilamantri kailash vishwakarma se navada jail jaakar mulaakaat thi
 After this, he said that these people had been implicated by the administration and administration, these allegations were rejected by CM Nitish
 sutron kii maane to iske baad bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne giriraaj ko bulaakar daure se pehle unki harkaton ke liye naaraazgi jaahir kii thi
 On the other hand, JDU has also advised its spokespersons to remain calm for the time being
 jediu ke netaaon or pravaktaaon par loksabhaa chunaav main siton ke batwaare se judaa koi bhi bayaan dene par bain laga diya he
 Significantly, in the Lok Sabha elections, there has been a lot of rhetoric for the last one month on all these issues between the BJP and JDU and the seat synergy between the BJP and JDU
 rajyasabha ke upasabhapati ke chunaav ke liye bijepi ko sahyogi dalon ke samarthan kii jarurat he
 In such a situation, Shah is constantly trying to help allies
 bataa den ki bihar main modi ko rokane ke liye argedy or congress jahaan puri koshish main jute hai

 In this regard, the District Magistrate removed 10 days ago by the Commission said that no such plant is being installed in Gonda in his knowledge

 In the course of just 16 years, there have been five major confrontations between the two countries, including the confrontation arising out of the 26 / 11 attacks in Mumbai
 inaki vajah se yaa to ve yuddh ke kareeb pahunch gaye yaa phir isaki parinti seemaa par tej sangharsh ke rup main saamne ai jaisaa ki kargil ke samay hua tha
 Kashmir has been an important issue between the two for many years and, with the recent proliferation of Islamic puppetry, it has also acquired religious color
 kashmir darasal vibhaajan ke baad hue bade saidhantik takaraav ke liye kai tarah se jariya ban gaya tha
 The Indian nation has always been a curse for Pakistan because of its secular, democratic foundation, which has presented itself as an Islamic republic
 khaas taur par abhi haal main bharat jab asaadhaaran vikaas dar ke saath kshetra kii ek badi takat ke rup main ubhara tab america ne bhi uske saath ranneetik saajhedaari ko majboot karne kii ichha jataai
 Pakistan's economy, on the contrary, is faltering, it has been inundated by internal discontent and divisive quarrels and has become a paradise for Islamic militant groups
 pakistani sena jisane is mulk ke astitv main aane ke 61 barason ke dauraan aadhe se bhi zyada samay se taanaashaahee ke jariye desh par sidhaa raaj kiya he, ko uski apni khud kii janata kii aalochana kaa shikaar bananaa padaa he
 Meanwhile, the US increased pressure on Afghanistan to wage unpopular war on the border so that the Taliban could be eliminated
 pakistani logon ne ise apane islamic bhaaiyon ke khilaaf america yuddh ke rup main dekha
 Due to this, for the first time in the history, the Pakistani army had to see the attitude of its soldiers turning their back on the army
 mumbai kaa 26 / 11 kaa hamalaa pakistani sena ke us nae khel kaa hi hissaa he jiske jariye vah kendriya bhoomika hasil kar apni sarvocchata sthapit karnaa chaahati he
 Actually targeting India is a tried recipe of Pakistani Army
 usne bharat ko laluhaan karne ke liye 1990 main apni ''waar of thounjand kats'' naamak ghaatak muhim shuru kii
 This was the same year that he had acquired nuclear weapons capability
 is ghatnakram kii vajah se bharat kii paaramparik yuddh kshamta kii sarvocchata naganya rah gai or purna yuddh kii sambhaavnaaen takreeban khatm ho gayi kyonki tay tha ki yadi aisa hua to yah nishchit rup se parmaanu jang kii shakl le legaa
 So Pakistan started small battles which were enough to hurt India but not enough to declare Delhi's war
 or jab sirf kashmir ko nishaanaa banane kaa vaanchit prabhaav nahin padaa to desh ke duusare hisson main aatankwaadi hamale shuru kar die gaye or vahaan dharmik sthalon ko hi nahin balki bharat ke aarthik hiton ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya
 As Prime Minister Manmohan Singh recently said, "pakistan is using terror as a state policy
" ''mumbai ke 26 / 11 ke hamale ko ab teji ke saath pakistani sena kii shaitani yojana ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he jiske jariye vah apane kai makasad sadhana chaahati he
 For example, if India talked about war as vigorously as it initially did, it would allow the Pakistani Army to gradually withdraw its 100,000 soldiers stationed on the outskirts of Afghanistan and then against them
 i would have got an excuse to deploy
 isaki vajah se yah bhi hota ki log majbootee ke saath sena ke peeche khadey ho jate or satta kii kaman sanbhaalane vaali nai loktantric gathbandhan sarkaar kinare ho jaati
 Because of this, General of Pakistan Army General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani would have come forward and could have carried out the bloodless coup if he wanted
 isse desh ek saajha shatru ke khilaaf ekajute bhi ho jaataa or ummid ke mutabik algaavvaadi or vibhaajankaree takatein thandi pad jaatin
 The Pakistani military is able to act with such unbridled confidence because it knows that India will hesitate to use the military option as it could lead to a nuclear confrontation
 kargil sector main ghuspaith karne ke baad bhadkaave kii gambhir karrwai ke bich bhi, bharat ne pashchimi seemaa par hamalaa karne ke bajaae oonchi chotiyon se ghuspaithiyon ke safaaye ke liye ek simit yuddh ko hi tarjeeh di thi
 Even India was initially hesitant after the 2001 attack on Parliament, although it later carried out 'operation Parakram', the largest military deployment along the border
 takreeban 10 maah ke takaraav ke baad bharat or tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne apana rukh naram kiya or pakistan ke saath shanti vaarta shuru kii
 Resistant diplomacy has not yielded any significant results
 sansad par hue hamale ke baad, bharat ke saath takaraav taalane ke maddenjar pakistan ke raashtrapati parvej musharraf ne jihadiyon ko kaabo karne kaa aashwaasan diya tha
 But only a few months later, terrorist organizations resumed their operations under other names
 sirf tabhi aisa hua ki ve musharraf ko bhi nishaanaa banane lage
 In 2002, India severed all diplomatic relations with Pakistan and banned all flights from Pakistan
 bharat ne pakistan ke saath sabhi aarthik or saanskrithik sambandh bhi tod liye the
 But soon it proved to be harmful and, after a year or so, diplomatic relations were restored
 mumbai hamalon ke baad bharat ab aisi mushkil sthiti main he ki uske paas le dekar ek joda vikalp hi bachaa haih vah simit yuddh shuru kare jo ki parmaanu takaraav main badal saktaa he or is tarah antarrashtriya hastkshep ko aamantrit kare yaa phir badhati hataasha ke saath haath par haath dhare baitha rahe kyonki pakistan uske khilaaf lagaae ja rahe har aarope ko nakaar rahaa he or aatankwaad ko rokane ke liye kuch nahin kar rahaa he
 India has such lessons from the time of the 1971 war that it should learn how it was carried out as a result of a carefully crafted strategy and plan
 maujuuda halaat main spasht lakshya ke saath usee tarah vyapak prayaas kii jarurat he
 If the goal was to destroy Pakistan during 1971, then the 2009 plan should be focused on neutralizing Pakistan so that it could never look at India again
 aise main 'sajag' ranneeti bharat kaa moolmantra honi chahie jisase bharat kai tarah ke dabaav banane ke centre viksit kar sake jisase pakistan uske yahaan maujuud vyapak aatanki dhaanche ko dhwast karne ke liye majaboor ho jaae
 India will have to constantly create international pressure, especially from the US, by providing evidence of Pakistan's involvement in the terrorist attacks
 use aatankwaad par ek vyapak sandhi ke liye sanyukt raashtra main dabaav bananaa chahie jo antarrashtriya samudaay ko pakistan ke khilaaf karrwai karne ke liye sakasham bana sake
 It can also consider all such diplomatic and economic sanctions that would further alienate Pakistan
 isamen vyapaar ke lihaaj se sabase variyata praapt desh ke rup main uskaa darja khatm kiye jane jaisi pahal bhi ho sakati he
 It should also put pressure on Pakistan to hand over the terrorists who carried out the Mumbai attacks
 bharat ke kadamon se pakistan ko yah ehsaas ho janaa chahie ki yadi bharat par ek or aatankwaadi hamalaa hota he to iskaa matlab hoga jang
 Experts: Experienced diplomats are giving their views on how pressure can be put on Pakistan

 He became very emotional about the first day spent on the net
 yuvaraj ne kaha, ‘kisi ne sochaa nahin tha ki main ek din cricket ke maidan par lautoonga
 The day i practiced on the first day on the net in Bangalore, shot, i could not tell how i was feeling
 wheelchair se maidan par janaa mere liye badi uplabdhi thi
 i have been in bed for four to six months and i only know how it felt to go to the ground
 ’chah maheene baad net par laute yuvaraj ne bataaya ki net par shuruuaat main vah dar jate the ki gend se chot naa lag jaye

 net par apane anubhav ke bare main unhone kaha, ‘pehle kuch din mansapeshiyon main kaaphi dard rahaa
 My body is currently 55 percent ready
 main gend ko acchhee tarah peet rahaa hum, kaiching or gendbaaji bhi durust he
 Eye and hand coordination is good, although the movement of the feet is still slow
 ’unhone kaha, ‘acha badlaav yah aayaa he ki ab main thaktaa nahin
 It is expected that after two months i will be able to return to the field again through the T20 World Cup
 ’ bharat ke sarvshereshth kshetrarakshakon main shumaar rahe yuvaraj rojaanaa paanch se chah ghante abhyaas kar rahe hai
 He said that his focus is on making Stamina as before
 yah poochne par ki apane khel main vah kya badlaav mahasoos kar rahe hai, unhone kaha ki abhi is bare main kuch kahana jaldbaaji hogi
 He said, 'right now i can't tell how i will play
 samaan paristhitiyon main kaisaa pradarshan karuunga
 It is too early to say about this
 main khud nahin jaanata
 Asked about the comeback, he said, "the T20 World Cup is a realistic goal
" usase pehle haalanki newjiland ke khilaaf do tii-20 match hone hai or main chahta hum ki unamem khelun
 It would be better to play these two matches directly before playing the World Cup in September
 ’ america main upachaar ke dinon ko yaad karke abhi bhi yuvaraj ke rongte khadey ho jate hai
 Alam was that he could not remember which day or year it was
 yahi nahin khun dekhakar ajiz aa chuke yuvaraj ko laal rang se nafrat ho gai thi
 He said, 'during chemotherapy, i once forgot that it is 2012
 mujhe laga ki vishwa cap abhi hua nahin he
 This was the effect of chemotherapy
 iske alaava maine itnaa khun dekha he ki mujhe laal rang se nafrat ho gai jabaki yah meraa pasandida rang tha
 'yuvraj, who is having trouble breathing during the war of cancer, is relieved that he is living like a common man
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe saans lene main kaaphi takalif hoti thi lekin ab donon fefdon se saans le rahaa hum
 Eating samosa chemotherapy ke daur main khaanaa dekh saktaa tha, soongh saktaa tha lekin kha nahin paata tha
 Thank God i am able to live like a normal man
 ’apni ‘party animal’ kii chhavi ke liye badnaam rahe yuvaraj ab kaaphi anushaasit ho gaye hai or ishwar main unki aasthaa badi he
 Their inner change is visible

 It is another matter that my room is still not clean
 main pehle se adhik majboot hua hum or ab roj is jindagi ke liye bhagwaan ko shukriya kahata hum
