 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) bjp-shiv Sena 161 seats in Maharashtra, BJP got 40 seats in Haryana Manohar Lal khattar-fadnavis Failmaharashtra and Haryana BJP is going to form the largest party once again in the elections in Haryana and Haryana
 jabaki, congress or maharashtra main uski sahyogi ensipi ko phir se vipaksh main baithne ke liye majaboor hona padegaa
 Apart from victory, defeat, good and bad performance, the results of the assembly elections of these two states have hidden many political messages, which can also have an impact on future politics
 1
 No impact on the Modi brand: The results of the maharashtra-haryana Assembly elections are not going to affect the status of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 maharashtra main devendra fadanvis or haryana main manohar laal khatter ke chehre ke sahare maidan main utari thi or piem modi ne in donon rajyon main duusare pradeshon kii tulana main bahut kam reliyaan kii
 In such a situation, the decrease of BJP seats is not going to affect the Modi brand, because in the name of Modi, BJP did better here in the Lok Sabha elections
 2
 People from Local Governments The results of the maharashtra-haryana Assembly elections indicate that people are not happy with the functioning of the bjp's state government
 vipaksh ne jis tarah sthaneey muddon ko uthaaya, jisase bijepi ko donon rajyon main nuksaan uthaanaa padaa he
 Whereas, in the Lok Sabha elections held just five months ago, BJP won record seats in these two states
 3
 bjp's overconfidence on the ground: BJP had agreed that victory was determined by seeing the opposition in the Haryana Assembly elections
 bijepi ke isi over confidence ke chalate party ke kai diggaj netaa jameen par utarkar apana dam kham nahin dikhaa sake
 Not only this, in all the surveys that were coming, the BJP was expected to get a tremendous victory
 bijepi ke rashtriya netaa bhi vidhansabha chunaav prachaar main bahut kam najar aae
 In such a situation, BJP lost its seats due to overconfidence
 4
 Sharad Pawar's NCP seats have increased from 40 to 54 in Kshatrapamahrashtra and Shiv Sena has also managed to win 56 seats
 aise hi haryana main bhupendra singh hooda ne congress ko 15 se 31 siton par pahunchaa diya he or 11 maheene pehle bani jejepi bhi 10 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi he
 In such a situation, it is clear from the result that in the current politics the politics of regional parties and the Chhatrapas is not over yet
 5
 Chandrayaan, 370, Pakistan In the Besar maharashtra-haryana assembly election, BJP was raising the issue of removal of 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, NRC, Chandrayaan-2 and Pakistan
 pradhanmantri narendra modi se lekar bijepi adhyaksh amit shah sahit party ke tamaam netaa inhen muddon kaa apane bhaashanon main zikr kar rahe the
 In such a situation, due to the decrease in the number of seats in both the states of BJP, it is clear that in these elections, these issues are baseless
 inhen lekar bijepi logon kaa dil nahin jeet saki he
 6
 vipaksh par nakel padi baarividhansabha chunaav ke nateezon se mana ja rahaa he ki maharashtra main ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar sahit unke bhattije ajit pavaar par idi kii karrwai or haryana main congress netaa bhupendra singh hooda par sibiai kii nakel kasnaa bijepi ke liye mahangaa sabit hua he
 While Pawar linked the action with Maratha Asmita, Hooda managed to garner sympathy by plotting to eliminate the politics of the Jat community from Haryana
 iskaa asar chunavi nateezon par saaf dekha ja saktaa he
 7
 bikharaa vipakshmaharashtra main bhale hi congress or ensipi ne milakar chunavi maidan main utari ho, lekin prakaash ambedkar or asaduddin ovaisi sahit tamaam kshetreey partiyaan alag-alag maidan main thim
 In such a situation, all the opposition parties in Haryana were trying their luck in different elections
 aise main kshetreey dalon ke bich vot bantaware kaa bijepi ko jabardast phayda mila
 If the party of Prakash Ambedkar and Owaisi had united with the congress-ncp in Maharashtra and JJP and BSP together with the Congress in Haryana, the election results could have made it difficult for the BJP to return to power
 8
 The Congress was completely battered during the sluggish and sleepy elections of Haryana and Maharashtra
 haryana main netritv ko lekar lambey sangharsh chal rahaa tha, lekin faisla chunaav elaan se chand din pehle kiya gaya
 Whereas in Maharashtra, the Congress could not present its face
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or mahasachiv priyanka gandhi puure chunaav prachaar main kahin bhi najar nahin ai
 While Rahul Gandhi held two rallies in Haryana and five in Maharashtra
 is tarah ke congress puri tarah soi hui najar ai
 9
 congress ke kendriya se rajyastareey netritv prabhaviharyana vidhansabha chunaav membhupendra singh hoodane jis tarah se ek maheene main congress ko mukhya mukaable or bijepi ko bahumat se dur kar yah sabit kar diya he ki party ke rashtriya netaaon se zyada rajya ke netaa hai
 Hooda won the Congress 31 seats on his own
 isse pehle sachin payalat-ashok gahalot ne rajasthan main, kamalnath-digvijay singh-sindhiya ne madhya pradesh or bhupesh baghel ne chhattisgarh main apane dam par jeet dilaakar sabit kar chuke hai
 Not only this, Ashok Chavan and Nitin Raut have been successful in showing their strength in Maharashtra
 10
 bjp's old success formula did not work in Maharashtra and Haryana elections
 haryana main inelo ke ek darjan vidhayak, basapa, akali dal or nirdaleey vidhayakon ko bijepi ne apane saath milaayaa or tikat diya he
 Most of these leaders have lost
 aise hi maharashtra main kareeb 35 netaaon ne congress-ensipi chhodkar bijepi kaa daaman thama tha, lekin janata ne 19 ko nakaar diya he
 Whereas BJP, with the help of defectors, had won the victory in the Lok Sabha as well as the UP and Uttarakhand assembly elections
 chaar din ke avkaash ke baad buudhvaar ko bhi sansad kii hangaamedaar shuruyaat hui
 The BJP raised the issue of sting till date when opposition leaders were involved in the game of exchanging old notes in Parliament
 satta paksh ke saansadon ne kaha ki is sting oparation se vipakshi netaaon kaa asli cheharaa saamne aa gaya he
 This issue should be discussed in Parliament
 vahiin rahul gandhi ne ek baar phir piem par hamalaa bolaa he
 Rahul Gandhi said that the Prime Minister is nervous with me
 mere paas unke bhrashtachar kii nijee jaankaree he
 The PM is not afraid to let him speak in the Lok Sabha
 modi or sarkaar bahes se dar rahe hai
 The entire opposition wants to discuss in Parliament for a month
 rahul ne kaha ki aisa pehali baar he ki sarkaar sadan main charchaa nahin chaahati he
 We have come by choosing
 hamen sadan main bolne diya jaae
 The Prime Minister should come to the House and participate in the discussion
 baad main janata faisla kar legi, koun sach bol rahaa he
 Congress became commission agent: Jagadambika Palalok Sabha created a ruckus on the sting of changing the notes till date
 sansadeey kaarymantri anant kumaar ne aaj tak kaa naam lekar congress, espi or bispi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Anant Kumar said that the opposition is busy failing the government's plan
 vahiin jagdambika paal ne kaha ki congress kamishan agent ban gai he
 The Congress, which participated in the freedom movement, is now turning white money into white
 congress mukhyalay underground bank ban gaya he
 The government will take information on the sting
 While the opposition parties are engaged in besieging the government on the issue of demonetisation, the sting operation till date on the game of the leaders of the opposition parties to replace the old notes has given the government a new weapon to surround the opposition
 venkaiya naidu ne is masale par kaha ki rigiju ne karmchaariyon ko jo vetan nahin mil rahaa tha, uski sifarish kii thi
 Congress was ruled at that time
 congress ko bhi ye pataa nahin he
 Naidu defended Rijiju, however, the Opposition is engaged in re-surrounding the government after the name of Union Minister Rijiju in the alleged scam in the hydro project in Arunachal

 Accusing the alleged scam of Rs 450 crore in a hydroelectric project in Arunachal Pradesh, the Congress created a ruckus in the Rajya Sabha and demanded the resignation of Minister of State for Home Kiran Rijiju

 '' BCCI President Anurag Thakur has said that the board has currently postponed plans to conduct 'mini IPL' in USA
 gauratlab he ki haal hi main bharat-westeindies ke bich hui tii-20 siries main america darshakon ne khaasi ruchi dikhaai thi, tab se america bazaar main pahunch banane ke liye 'mini ipel' ke aayojan kii sambhaavnaaon ko bal mil rahaa tha
 According to BCCI President Anurag Thakur, the biggest hurdle in this is the difference in time zones, which can make a difference in viewership
 espncricinfo se thakur ne kaha, "mujhe lagata he ki hamen samay main antar ko samajhnaa chahie
 IPL tournament in India from 7 pm to 11 pm
 30 baje tak dekha jaataa he
 So we have to play in the USA at such a time that it matches the time of India
 yadi ham yahaan (america main) din main khelte hai, to bharat main match raat main dekhe jaaenge, kyonki isamen broadcasting ek ahm cheez he
 Also, you cannot ignore the domestic audience while playing outside the country
 aise main sawaal yah uthta he ki aap uese ke kis praant main khelenge? yah sabase bada mudda he
 
 
 ' thakur ne aage kaha, "IPL ko to ham bharat se baahar yojit karaane ke bare main soch bhi nahin rahe
 It should be in India itself, but there are many other options that can be considered
 is market ke liye jab bhi hamaare paas lambii samyavadhi vaala plan aa jayega, ham aapke saath saajha karenge
 Comments bisisiai ne mini ipel yaa desh se baahar ipel yojit karaane ko lekar june main ghoshnaa kii thi

 Is seen until 30 o'clock
 isliye hamen uese main aise samay par khelnaa hoga ki uskaa bharat ke samay se mail ho jaae
 If we play here (in the US) during the day, then matches in India will be watched at night, because broadcasting is an important thing in it
 saath hi aap desh se baahar khelte samay gharelu darshakon ko nazarandaaj nahin kar sakate
 In such a situation, the question arises that in which province of USA will you play? This is the biggest issue
 
 
 ' Thakur further said, "we are not even thinking of organizing the IPL outside India
 yah bharat main hi honi chahie, lekin kai anya vikalp bhi hai, jin par vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Whenever we have a long-term plan for this market, we will share it with you

 Communications and Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the government had issued advisory keeping this risk in mind
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki saibar atake se bachane ke liye sibar koordination centre june tak kaam karne lagegaa
 The government also said that all the stake holders have been advised to use the patch system so that the risk of any cyber attack is minimized
 kendriya sanchaar mantri ne mana ki sibar atake kii kuch chhotput khabaren unhen andhra pradesh or kerala se mili hai, lekin bharat sarkaar main abhi zyaada prabhaav dekhne ko nahin mila he
 On the other hand, the Home Ministry has also warned the banks of the country to take necessary steps related to cyber security

 khasbaat he ki bharat main ajtak jitne bhi sibar hamale hue hai, unamem‘siiarti-in’kii bhoomika bilkul hi naganya rahi hai
 The biggest example of this was seen last year, when reports of secret preparations related to India's submarine were exposed and 'cert-in' did not even get the news

 Hearing our suggestion, Rao remained silent for a few minutes with a calm gesture, then suddenly screamed angrily and his words meant something like, 'is it necessary to have such a train with the Congress party To be treated in such a manner that all the coaches are being pulled from the engine of the nehru-gandhi dynasty or is there any other option? ”I was stunned to see Rao's way of expressing anger
 main chup rahaa, haalanki kesari ne baat ko aage badhaayaa or kaha ki agar ham sonia gandhi ko party adhyaksh kaa pad de dete hai to halaat kuch had tak sanbhal jaaenge
 Rao felt as if he had said too much in a short period of time and had hurriedly exposed his feeling of opposition to the Nehru dynasty
 unhone sanbhalte hue poocha, ''is suzav se koi nuksaan nahin hone vaala, lekin kya ve ise sweekaar karengi?'' is sawaal kaa hamaare paas turant to koi jawaab nahin tha, sivaay iske ki ham sonia gandhi ke paas jate or unki pratikriya lete

 The meeting he had with Narasimha Rao (at his residence 3, Race Course Road) is well remembered when he returned from America
 vahaan sirf ham donon the
 They were sitting on a lavatory and talking about all the domestic issues
 achaanak ve uchake or jor dekar bole, ''mujhe kisi kaa dar nahin kyonki ab mere sir par president (jorge) bush senior kaa haath he
 "I was shocked by this unexpected explosion because the issues we were talking about had nothing to do with President Bush
" yah shaayad ek aise pradhanmantri kii bheetar kii aawaaj thi jise bush se mulaakaat ke baad kuch bal mila tha or use lagata tha ki mushkil halaat main bush kaa samarthan unki raah aasaan kar degaa
 i kept quiet for a while, trying to understand his point, then i said, "we are also happy with the support you got from President Bush but in the current context President Bush will not be able to do anything in our interest
" '' maine kaha, ''aise maamlat main apane mulyon or vichaardhaara ke prati hamaari patibaddhta or dridhtaa hi hamen bachaa sakati he
 "nero of India, Narasimha Rao
 Prime Minister Narasimha Rao was trying to keep everyone happy on Ayodhya
" jab kabhi koi gambhir kism kii khabar un tak aati, ve turant apane kisi sahyogi se chaahate ki vah hindutv brigade ke kisi sadsy se milakar maamle ko patari par le aae
 To such an extent, he tried to keep everyone happy that on one occasion he decided to go and meet the RSS chief (madhukar Dattatreya Deoras also known as Babasaheb Deoras) to remove pressure from the government
 To be cooled
 maine is prastaavit kadam par aapatti jataai or kaha ki isse to sarkaar kii badi badanaami hogi
 i said that instead the Prime Minister should call him in his office
 ab tak mere or pradhanmantri ke bich matbhed saarvajanik ho chuke the, lekin maine ek cabinet sahyogi ke naate apana sanyam or anushaasan banaae rakhaa, haalanki kuch maukon par aisa karnaa mushkil bhi hota tha
 i do not know when the files of the CPPA meetings will be public, but whenever this happens, people will know how a confused government had tried hard to pull out Ayodhya
 maine kabhi kisi sarkaar kaa itnaa kharaab pradarshan nahin dekha
 *** i reached Delhi on the evening of 4 December
 agali subah maine narsingh raav se mulaakaat karke uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri kalyaan singh se hui baatcheet kii unhen aksharshah jaankaree de di
 Rao was pretending that he was listening carefully to me, but it was not so
 ve mudde ko gambhirtha se nahin le rahe the
 It felt like i am giving details of my ordinary meeting with a small officer
 mere baat khatm karne par unhone poocha, ''halaat kaa aapkaa apana akalan kya kahata he?'' maine jawaab diya, ''aapane mujhe lakhanu se baahar jane kii anumati nahin di, to main aapako kya akalan de saktaa hum?'' unhone or adhik jaananaa chaha, ''are nahin, main jaanata hum ki aapke apane strot hai, isliye main jaananaa chaah rahaa hum ki aane vaale dinon main halaat kaise honge?'' maine unhen saaf shabdon main bataaya ki babari masjid dhaha di jaaegi
 This news shook them and they wanted to challenge my claim, but after thinking something they kept quiet
 kuch jhanjhanaate hue ve teji se atkal lagane lage ki yadi masjid dhaha di gai to uske nattejey kya ho sakate hai
 Suddenly he came to knowledge and shouted, "this will have a very bad effect on the Congress party", although this was clearly evident
 us pal main khud ko roak nahin paaya or unase kade shabdon main kah diya ki hamane bijepi or anya hindutv samarthak sanghathanon kii cargujariyon par ''apni ankhen moond rakhi hai
 "so he asked," When can this (demolition) happen? "I replied," Anytime
 " '' mujhe khud andaja nahin tha ki thik agle hi din (6 disambar, 1992) ko masjid dhaha di jaaegi
 On that important day, i was already informed about the visit to a program organized by young Congress MP Jagmeet Singh Brar in Muktsar, Punjab, 380 km from Delhi, and i informed the Prime Minister about it
 ***mere dimag main masjid dhahaae jane kii chhaviyaan lagaataar gum rahi thim or main soch rahaa tha ki hamaare desh ke itihaas main is traasad ghatana ke nihitarth acolpaneey or aseemit honge
 India's secular fabric had disintegrated
 yahi sochate-sochate maine muktsar se pradhanmantri awaas par dopaher main phone lagaaya
 i was told that they "cannot talk to anyone" right now
 ''maine jawaab dene vaale se poochhaah ''ve kab se baatcheet nahin kar rahe hai? yaa phir ve dilli se baahar hai?'' usne jawaab diya, ''ve dilli main hi hai, lekin unhone khud ko ek kamare main band kar liya he or hamen nirdesh die gaye hai ki unhen kisi bhi sthiti main disturb na kiya jaae
 "suddenly in my mind that famous image of Nero flashed when he was playing a flute while Rome was burning
" maine apane mejabaan se turant anumati lee or dilli ke liye nikal padaa
 Reaching Delhi at four o'clock in the evening, i went straight to the Prime Minister's residence
 narsingh raav ne ab tak apane kamare kaa darwaja nahin kholaa tha, lekin apane pradhan sachiv ko nirdesh de diya tha ki unke nivas par hi shaam 6 baje cabinet kii apaat baithak bulaai jaae
 Other backward classes (obcs) account for about 50 per cent of the population of India
 bhartiya samvidhan main pehla sanshodhan 1951 ke madhya main pandit jawahar laal nehru lekar aae the, jisamen is varg ke liye vishesh praavdhaan tha
 It will hardly be said that the states did not pass any special law to provide facilities like educational programs and employment to this class including reservation
 savarnon main is varg ke prati ek dabaa-chipa purvaagrah tha
 He was strongly against any special provision for the obcs
 mere vichaar se, is tarah kaa virodh saaf taur par anyaay hi tha, jise jald se jald sudhaarna jaruri tha
 i raised this issue as the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh in June 1980
 rajya main pichhadaa varg ayog kaa gathan kiya or jahaan tak sambhav ho sakaa, ayog ke sujhaavon ko lagu bhi kiya
 However this was also inadequate
 ucch shaikshanik sansthaanon main anusuchit jati evam janajatiyon ke liye to aarakshan tha, lekin unki tarj par pichde varg ke liye aarakshan kaa koi praavdhaan nahin tha
 The Mandal Commission report in 1980 recommended reservation for obcs in jobs, which came into force in August 1990
 us samay ve
 P
 singh pradhanmantri the
 But even then reservation in educational institutions was not implemented
 is babat maine jab-jab apane doston or sahyogiyon se charchaa kii, har baar sannata pasra hua paaya, asweekruti bharaa maun
 Despite this, i decided to move forward
 2006 kii shuruyaat main bataur kendriya maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri maine pradhanmantri dow
 Openly formally raised the issue in front of Manmohan Singh
 haalanki shuruyaat main ve bhi jhzki, lekin baad main unhone mujhe anumati de di
 As soon as the news of my efforts came out, the opposition of my plans started from the upper class
 isi varg ne ve
 P
 singh ke kaarykaal main bhi aarakshan kaa kadaa virodh kiya tha
 Even in august-september 1990, anti-reservation students staged violent demonstrations in northern India
 kuch ne to virodh jataane ke liye aatmadah tak kar liya tha
 Public property was damaged, especially buses burnt
 main aisa ghatnaon kaa doharaav nahin chahta tha
 So, to achieve my goal, i continued to work a little more carefully and in a systematic way
 maine saansadon kii sarvadaleey baithak bulaai, jisamen mere prastaav ko khushi-khushi sweekaar kar liya gaya
 Whereas in the northern states of the country, the media carried out a campaign that told how once again the "mandalisation" of the society was going to happen and i would be held responsible
 may 2006 main puure uttari bharat main iske khilaaf pradarshan shuru ho gaye
 There was no adverse reaction from South India as the OBC reservation policy was implemented from time to time by various state governments
 prishthbhumi kuch is prakaar haih united progressive elliance (upie), jisamen vam dal shaamil the, kii samanvay samiti ke samaksh maine apane prastaav ko zyada se zyada sweekaarya rup main pesh kiya or sabhi sadasyon ne is niti kaa puraa samarthan kiya
 It was decided that it should be implemented as it is in the "present form"
 niti ko lagu hone se bhatakaane ke liye kaaphi tarkiben apanaai gayi
 In early 2006, a group of Rajputs pitted against me
 pehle to unhone mujhe aisa na karne kii salaah di or baad main chetavanee dete hue kaha ki yah kadam vinaashkari he
 He felt that such a step would end the dominance of the upper castes
 maine unase apni raay badalane kaa aagrah kiya or yah bhi kaha ki iske jo bhi nattejey honge, main unka saamana karne ke liye taiyaar hum
 On this, he said that it is not possible to implement this policy without amending the constitution
 meraa jawaab tha, ''is baat se main waakif hum or samvidhan main sanshodhan ho sake, iske liye main har sambhav koshish karuunga
 Accordingly, a cabinet paper (amendment proposal) was prepared and presented before the Council of Ministers for approval
 mantrimandal ke bheetar aise mahatvapurn or taqatvar log the, jo is tarah ke sanshodhan ke sakht khilaaf the or jinhone isaki sweekruti ke raste main rode atakane ke liye har sambhav jugat laga di
 But my stand was clear and i stood firm on my stand
 main pradhanmantri or congress adhyaksh ko yaad dilaataa rahaa ki yah sanshodhan saamaajik nyaay ke prati sarkaar or party kii nishtha ko majboot karegaa
 The proposal was finally approved by the Cabinet in January 2006, which came into being as the 93rd amendment to the Indian Constitution

 After the completion of the cabinet formation, when i came to know that my name is not in the list of Council of Ministers, i was left speechless, what i had not done for so many decades as a loyalist of the Congress Party
 ek jamaane main mujhe indira gandhi or rajeev gandhi kaa bharosa hasil tha or unke kaarykaal main maine kai ahm jimmedaariyaan nibhaai thim

 yogaguru baba ramdev durga shakti nagpal ke suspension ko to galat tehra rahe hai lekin isse zyada wo akhilesh sarkaar ke khilaaf kuch bhi bolne ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 Yes, but Ramdev did not miss out on targeting Sonia Gandhi as soon as she got a chance
 nagpal ke saath ninsaphi hui he, ye kahana he baba ramdev
 However, when Baba Ramdev was asked if what Mulayam Singh and Akhilesh Sarkar did to Durga was wrong, Baba is not only refraining from saying anything on this, but he says that what he had to say is enough
 in sab ke bich baba ramdev ko achaanak yaad ai sonia gandhi kaa wo patr, jo unhone shanivaar ko pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko likh kar kaha tha ki durga shakti nagpal ke saath ninsaphi naa ho
 Baba, in response to this letter, reminded Sonia why Sonia did not write a letter about Haryana IAS officer Ashok Khemka
 baba ramdev ne sawaal uthaaya ki ashok khemka ke bare main sonia kaa loktantr kahaan gaya tha
 The case of Durga, an IAS officer of Uttar Pradesh, may be causing trouble for the UP government, but Baba Ramdev sees a bigger case of Haryana's IAS Ashok Khemka
 mudda kuch bhi ho par baba ramdev ke nishane par hameshaa congress, pradhanmantri or sonia gandhi hi rahete hai, ab maamla upi sarkaar or nilambit iees adhikari durga kaa ho par baba ko yahaan bhi sonia or rahul par nishaan saadhane kaa mauka mil gaya
 Baba said that there was injustice to Durga but where did Sonia's democracy go when the senior IAS Ashok Khemka of Haryana was repeatedly transferred in the Robert Vadra case
 baba ramdev ne durga ke liye kaha, 'durga shakti ke saath ninsaphi hui he or ye ninsaphi sabhi sarkarein or sabhi raajnneetik dal karte hai
 'when Baba was asked if Durga's suspension should be returned, in this case Baba Ramdev said,' It is done, as much as i have spoken so fine
 'baba ramdev ko khanan mafia chote lagate hai
 He said, 'there is less loot in this, but in coal and petroleum people are getting more loot
 ' baba ramdev ke liye khanan mafiaon se bade kaale dhan ko videshon main jamaa karne vaalen hai
 Regarding the mining mafia, Baba Ramdev said, "the mining mafia are very hostile to the country and they are fueled by them, corrupt leaders and corrupt rights
 'baba ke nishane par keval sonia, rahul, pradhanmantri hi kyon rahate hai
 No matter how many wrong things Mulayam and his son or his party do, why does Baba's tongue tremble in speaking against him
 baba ko mulaayam se dar kyon lagata he, yaa phir baba mulaayam ke prati hameshaa kyon itane naram rahete hai
 Is this Baba's Yadav love or his political compulsion, they are also beginning to understand all this

 pyaar ek behad khubasurat ehsaas he lekin is baat se har koi ittefaq rakhata ho, aisa bhi nahin he
 While some girls weave different kinds of dreams about relationship, love and love, there are some girls who hate the word relationship
 kuch mahilaayein aisi hoti hai jinhen kisi ke saath hona pasand nahin hota
 The reason behind this is not that she considers it a bond but rather she is not convinced about many other reasons and considers the relationship as a compulsion
 mahilaon kii is soch ke liye kai vajahen ho sakati hai:1
 If a woman believes in being stuck in a relationship, one of the main reasons for this is that she has had a bad experience before this
 ho saktaa he ki isse purv jab vah kisi ke sathrilation main rahi ho to use maansik or shaareerik ksht mila ho
 In such a situation, sometimes girls are afraid to enter into a new relationship due to bad experiences
 2
 Many times it happens that some girls are not aware of the benefits of being in a relationship
 unhen lagata he ki kisi relation main padane par unke paas khud ke liye vakt hi nahin rah jayega or unhen duusare ke liye jeena padegaa
 In such a situation, she does not hesitate to get into any relationship
 3
 There are many times that women are unable to believe that they will be able to handle this relationship
 unhen lagata he ki yah ek bahut badi jimmedaari he or isse bachanaa hibehatar he
 4
 kai ladakiyon ko lagata he ki unki soch kabhi bhi kisi se nahin milegi or ve kisi bhi tarah ke vaad-vivaad main nahin padana chaahati hai
 Because of this too, they feel that it is better to live alone than with the helplessness of relationship with someone
 jaruri nahin ki aapkaa jo pehla rishta ho vah apane anjaam tak pahunch paae yaa vah aapke liye ekadam sahi ho
 When you move out of this relationship, you leave behind a past
 aise raaj koi baahar nahin laana chahta
 But if your partner knows this from somewhere else or from someone else, it would be better if you tell them the truth to yourself
 vaise bhi jhooth kii buniyaad par khadaa koi bhi rishta bahut din tak tik nahin saktaa he
 But this thing is serious
 aise main aapako is baat kaa puraa khyaal rakhana chahie ki ise bataane kaa tarika sahi ho
 Saying the right thing in the wrong way worsens rather than making it happen
 aap chahen to ye kuch tareeke aajamaa sakate hai :1
 Do not mention any such thing even in the first meeting
 aisa karnaa galat sabit ho saktaa he
 Let your relationship grow a little deeper, let your trust in each other grow
 uske baad hi is baat kaa zikr karen
 2
 apane college ke dinon kaa zikr karte hue or apane doston kii kahaniyaan sunaate-sunaate bhi aap apane partner ko apane eks ke bare main bataa sakate hai
 3
 agar aap koiromantic filmdekh rahe hai or film main bhi kuch aisa hi dikhaaya ja rahaa he to bhi aap apni baat rakh sakate hai
 With this, you will have the means to give reference
 4
 Be sure to check your partner's mood before telling this thing
 aisa na ho ki wo pehle se hi kisi baat ko lekar pareshaan or tanaav main hon or aapaki baat sunne ke baad use samaj hi na paae
 5
 aap chahen to kisi kaagaj par ye sari baaten achche andaaj se likhakar bhi apane partner ko apane is raaj ke bare main bataa sakate hai
 Whatever be the method, but you should talk about it in a way that suggests that it was your past and that you are fully dedicated to this relationship in the present

 If you consider shoe polishing to be small or low-level work, then change your mind
 kyonki koi bhi kaam chota yaa bada nahin hota
 If the idea is good, it is not impossible to achieve success through any work
 ye kahani he mumbai ke 'sandip gajakas' kii
 Those who decided to pursue a career in engineering, decided to do the work that people might not want to do even under compulsion
 wo kaam he – juuta polishing or repering kaa
 Sandeep did not like the mess at first left home and then asked for alms, now the country's first transgender judge Jajshuru
 ghar, daftar ho yaa khud ke juute, unhen kuch bhi ganda bardaasht nahin tha
 You will be surprised to know that he is a billionaire today because of his cleaning habits
 unhone juute kii londring shuru kar yah sabit kar diya ki koi kaam chota yaa bada nahin hota
 Sandeepasandeep is an engineer, had done engineering from Gajakas National Institute of Firing Engineering
 vah job ke liye gulf jane kii taiyaari kar rahe the, lekin tabhi 2001 main america par 9 / 11 kaa atake hua or unhone videsh jane kaa plan drop kar diya
 After dropping the job plan abroad, Sandeep decided to start a shoe polish business
 kareeb 12 hajaar rupee kharch kar unhone bijness shuru karne kii taiyaari kii 
 This girl is suffering from Down syndrome, started her own business house, was not happy
 An engineer should do shoe polishing and repairing, which parents would like it
 sandip ke gharavaale unke is kaam se bilkul khush nahin the
 But still he listened to the hearts of the people by ignoring the things of the people
 sirf 12 hajaar rupee kharch kar bijness shuru kiya
 He started polishing and repairing shoes of friends and relatives by making the bathroom a workshop
 bihar kala puraskaar se sammanit hue 24 kalakarasandip ne ek intervyuu main bataaya tha ki vah juuta polish ke bijness ko sirf polish se nikaalkar repering tak le janaa chaahate the
 In such a situation, he did research for a long time
 is dauraan unhone lakhon rupee kharch kiye or fail hote rahe
 Sandeep told that 'I was looking for innovative ways to make old shoes brand new and repair them'
 maine research par sabase zyada samay bitaayaa or us research ke badaulat hi 2003 main apana or desh kii pehali 'da shu londry' company shuruyaat kii
 i learned to fail first in order to succeed and discovered ways i should not
 mumbai ke andheri ilaake main shuru hui gajakas kii ye company aaj desh ke kai shaharon main pahunch chuki he
 Sandeep today franchises it and the company's turnover has reached crores
 shuruyaat main bhale hi kaaphi log unke is faisle par hanse honge lekin ye bhi sach he ki'jis -jis par ye jag hansaa he, usee ne itihaas rachaa he' There is a fierce battle between the two directors of the film Krish and Kangana Ranaut these days over the direction credits of 'manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi'
 kangana ranut (kangana Ranaut) kii tarah se morcha unki bahan rangoli chandel ne sambhaal rakhaa he or ve soshal media par krish par lagaataar hamale kar rahi hai
 Kangana Ranaut's sister Rangoli Chandel got angry when Krrish described 'manikarnika' as her own baby
 rangoli chandel ne ek ke baad ek kai twit kiye or unhone kangana ranut kii 'manikarnikah da queen of jhaansi (manikarnika: The Queen Of Jhansi)' ke riter vijayendra prasad ke saath massej par hui baatcheet ko bhi share kiya he
 Kangana Ranaut's film grossed 50 crores at the box office
 kii kamai kar chuki he
 Krish it's true that you had completed Manikarnika like you completed NTR which is a big disaster, but what you gave was so bad that's why you were asked to leave, we were all being polite but seems Laton ke bhoot baton se nahin mante @ dirkrish pic
 twitter
 com / wvzrbmh6gx This is for all my friends to see here's Kangana's messages to Vijendra Prasad on October 4th, not only she fought for his credit even begged him to be a part of the team
 
 
 
 @dirkrish pic
 twitter
 com / kop1lxid3q He did everything to ruin the film, took film's DOP away, didn't let any of ad's from previous team to work with her, he didn't support anyone in the team and now he is saying Manikarnika is his baby
 
 
 
 @dirkrish What an opportunist
 
 
 
 this industry makes me laugh
 
 
 
 greatness of Kangana is she went against everyone and fought for his credit
 
 
 
 Krish look at you and look at Kangana
 
 
 that is why she is where you can never be
 
 
 @dirkrish
 
 
 
 he never took anyone's calls, coz Kangana gave him co director credit she wantedd him to see the final cut, he never came to see the cut
 
 
 bt now in a very calculative move he appears when the film declared a hit &highly critically acclaimed wat an opportunist @dirkrishkamgana ranut (kangana Ranaut) kii bahan rangoli chandel ne twitor par 'manikarnikah da queen of jhaansi (manikarnika: The Queen Of Jhansi)' ke ko-diarector krish ko likhaa he, 'krish yah sahi he ki aapane manikarnika (manikarnika) ko usee tarah puraa kiya jaise aapane antiaar ko kiya he, or vah bahut badi flop sabit hui he
 But everything you did was so bad that you were asked to leave the film
 ham sab bahut vinamr bane hue the lekin lagata he laaton ke bhoot baton se nahin maanate
 Not only this, Rangoli Chandel has also taken a screen shot of Kangana Ranaut's message in which she is telling Vijayendra Prasad how she has struggled with the producers to give Krish a director credit
 She is really hurt with constant conspiracies and attacks
 
 
 
 because of these people she is not even able to enjoy her well deserved holiday 
 
 
 
 so sad pic

 'rangoli has tweeted another,' What a chance
 
 
 is industry par mujhe hansi aati he
 
 
 See Kangana's greatness, she went against everyone and fought to her credit
 
 
 krish apni ore dekho or kangana ko dekho
 
 
 Therefore, where he is today, you can never reach there
 
 
 usne kabhi kisi kii kol nahin lee
 Kangana gave him the credit of co-director so she wanted him to see the final cut, but he never came
 
 
 lekin ab film hit ho gai he to ve is tarah mauka parast banakar aae hai
 Kangana Ranaut's 'manikarnika' came under controversy when its director Krish left the film in the middle, and Kangana Ranaut took over as director

 haryana vidhansabha chunaav par chandigarh main 'panchayat aaj tak' main pradesh ke diggaj netaaon ne apni-apni party ke samarthan main daawey kiye
 The topic of the second session of the Panchayat was titled 'team-changing game'
 yah seshan un netaaon par he, jinhone congress chodi or abhi alag-alag partiyon main hai
 Know what the leader said in this
 
 
 congress chhodkar bijepi kaa daaman thaamne walebirendra singhraajnneeti ke 'tregedi king' samajhe jate hai
 Some questions and their answers are as follows
 
 
 kya siem pad kii chahat he?raajnneeti main agar chahat na ho raajnneeti main aane kaa koi phayda nahin
 On the question that ideology has no meaning
 golmol jawaab diya
 Nobody's innings in politics is over
 karpshan ke sawaal pardesh kii jo haalat hui, janata bhi iske liye jimmedaar he
 Has the Gandhi family failed? If the PM of the country is non-political then problems will arise that will not be solved
 purv piem manmohan singh kaa zikr kiya
 Do you want to become CM? Someone comes to dig grass in politics
 yah bhi koi baat he
 i did not leave the party to become a minister, a cabinet minister's offer came in the UPA government
 maine siem ko badalane ke liye sonia gandhi ko kai baar kaha
 Avatar Singh Bhadana left Congress and joined INLD
 
 
 haryana main congress hooda congress banakar rah gai he
 Hooda has four brokers involved in the scam and CLO business
 maine media ke saamne bhi kai baar inke khilaaf aawaaj uthaai he
 There is no justification for staying in the Congress in which respect is not saved
 raajnneeti main aate hai jate hai badal jate hai lekin maine raajnneeti swaarth ke liye nahin, devilal ke parivaar main vaapasi, ek kaaryakarta ke taur par kaam karuunga
 Doesn't the party see corruption? i don't see the party, i see Devilal's family
 bhadaana ne siem hooda ke khilaaf morcha kholaa
 a call to unite rebel leaders against the CM
 congress chhodkarharyana jan chetana partibanane walevinod sharmaane kaha ki bhedbhaav, kshetravaad ke chalate congress chodi
 When i put my point, no one listened
 maine sansadeey chunaav se pehle party chodi
 People told in the Lok Sabha elections that he was disillusioned with the Congress
 congress main bhai bhatijawad, naukariyon main bhedbhaav he
 On Hooda's question, i do not accuse anyone for no reason
 kya aap hooda ke liye kavach kaa kaam kar rahe hai, taaki unka voter chhitakkar aapke paas chalaa jaae?siem kaa naam sidhe taur par lene se bachate hue sharma ne kaha, main kisi ko gaali dene main main vishwaas nahin rakhata
 The level of politics should be maintained
 alag soch rakhana meraa haq he
 Did CM Hooda allot illegal land to Robert Vadra? If this is proved then i am the first person to raise voice for action against CM
 desh kaa kanoon apana kaam kar sakati he
 On the relationship with Hooda - CM and i have been together for 50 years
 skool main saath padhe hai
 While stating his vision, the job interview system should end in the state
 kaabiliyat se naukari milani chahie
 System or CM Corrupt? People are corrupt
 logon se yah system banataa he
 Until this system is fixed, we will fight

 The voter is aware
 rigerveshan main savarna garibon ke saath dhokhaa hua he
 a wave of change is blowing in Haryana
 ek bhi mantri cabinet main nahin, is par bhadaana ne chutki lee
 At least Arvind Sharma would have been a railway minister, the people of Haryana would have boarded the railway

 bahubali-2: da kanklusen ko duniya bhar main joardaar rispons mila he
 Along with the elders, this film has also fascinated children
 ve bhi yah jaanane ko theatres main pahunche ki aakhir katappa ne bahubali ko kyon maaraa tha

 film main dikhaai gai hinsa ko dekhte hue singapore ke sensor board ne film ko NC16 certificate diya he jiskaa matlab he ki 16 saal se kam umr ke bachche is film ko nahin dekh paaenge
 What the film says on this certificate: According to a report by the Indian Censor boarddna, Censor Board of India Chairman Pahlaj Nihalani told that the film was released on our behalf with a u / a certificate without any cut
 lekin singapore ke film sensor board ke hisaab sebahubali-2main jarurat se zyada hinsak drishy dikhaae gaye hai
 Especially those scenes in which soldiers are beheaded
 pehlaajane yah bhi spasht kiya ki asia or europe ke kai deshon main bharat kii tulana main zyada filmon ko e-certificate miltaa he
 We hear similar stories from childhood, because the reason for not considering Bahubali-2 as violent in India is seen in our culture
 unke mutabik, ham bachapan se hi puranic kahaniyon main rakshason kaa vadh karte samay unka galaa kaatane kii kahaniyaan sunate aate hai
 In such a situation, children can easily understand the scenes shown in Bahubali-2

 With regard to the feelings of the country, Pahlaj Nihalani also expressed his pain over the controversies related to the censor board and the film certificate
 unka kahana he ki bharat main sensorship sahi cheez ke liye nahin he balki yah bhaawanaaon se judaa mudda he
 If we were to chop a scene to cut the head in Bahubali-2, then people's feelings would be hurt
 agar ham koi kis seen katate hai to hamen pichhadi soch vaala kaha jaataa he
 How much has Bahubali-2 earned, according to figures, Bahubali-2 has so far earned Rs 1425 crore

 It is the people of Nitish Kumar's village who are troubled by the bureaucracy, how the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was told by the people of his village himself
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke paitruk gaanv kalyaan bighaa ke saikadon log patna main mukhyamantri nivas pahunche
 They complained that the police did not listen to them
 in logon main sthaneey police or afasarshahi ke ravaiye ko lekar baari aakrosh tha
 Actually, a tractor was stolen in Nitish Kumar's ancestral village Kalyan Bigha, which the villagers complained to the police
 haftaa bhar biit jane ke baad bhi police jab haath par haath dhare baithi rahi to gaanv waalon ne nalanda jile ke aaladhikariyon ke saamne guhaar lagaai, lekin phir bhi koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 After this, the patience of the villagers of Kalyan Bigha broke down
 naaraaz gaanv vaale ek bas par savaar hokar mangalvaar ko mukhyamantri ke awasaiya karyaalay pahunch gaye or apni naaraazgi jaahir kii
 Some officials knew his problem
 akhilesh jite yaa haare to ye hedline hogi
 
 
 - Work is spoken - chal gai saikil Tipu became Sultan of UP - kaam nahin bol sakaa he - Hand punctured the bicycle - upi ko ye saath pasand nahin he We should study the language of anchors
 kai baar shabd ghis gaye se lagate hai
 Those are the adjectives that are used every time
 kisi bhi mausam main chunaav ho, magar chunavi garmi zarur bolenge
 Politics always heats up
 inhen ham kaich line, tag line or hedline kehete hai
 It is called headlines in Hindi
 kaale badal chantane vaale hai, chal gai jhaadu, kiski manegi holi, upi main manegi kesaria holi
 In democracy, we still use throne and coronation, coronation
 ham aapako bataa den ki agle bees saal tak aise hi karte rahenge
 No election is complete without a leaf scrub and a scrub
 11 taarikh ko koi na koi supada saaf kaa istamaal zarur karegaa
 Congress in UP and Akali Dal sweep in Punjab
 safaya bhi ek jumala he
 Akali Dal eliminated
 cycle kaa safaya
 Now the cycle has two meanings
 yaa to kisi ne saaf kar chamakaa diya yaa saaf kar gaayab kar diya
 Whether we sit or stand anchor, but we say again and again the question arises from here
 khwamkhaah sawaal ko kyon khadaa kar dete hai ham log
 He speaks as if he is asking whom he will fall from the chair
 kahin na kahin, iske bina to kisi ne bharat main ankaring hi nahin kii he
 Do not understand what happens somewhere
 sabase saradard hota ji haa sunakar
 Yes, what happens like we are telling the audience and you are also considered stupid
 isliye priy patrakaron, darshakon ke saamne ye ji haa mat bolnaa
 As soon as the anchor says that there will be no saying, then i feel that now i will not listen
 aap kehane ke liye hi baithe hai to kyon bolte hai ki kahana na hoga
 Anchor is sitting to say or not to say
 gauratlab he aap sun kaise lete hai
 It is not known what to look for and what has been called
 zaahir he jaise hi koi ankar bolta he, lagata he ki bas abhi tak jo bol rahaa tha kuch zaahir nahin tha
 Now it is revealed oont kis karavat baithegaa se bachein
 And now, without seeing it, i will give a ten-rupee trophy to anyone who anchors
 tasviir kaa rukh yaa tasviir saaf yaa tasviir banati hui dikhaai de rahi he
 Especially and usually as soon as it comes, the mind gets entangled in whether the anchor's mind is clear about what is common and what is special because it uses it clearly
 rou-ba-rou sunate hi lagata he kanpur bhaag jaaen
 Speak frantically, in a gesture, who is it that can free us anchors? vaise koi mukt hona nahin chahta phir bhi
 It seems as if the exit poll is fake
 patkhni, chitt ye sab to na jane kitne aise hai jinke kaaran hamaari bhashaa marati hui lagati he
 It seems that whether Modi wins or Akhilesh wins, we will understand the election with all these phrases
 netaa bhi bolne lage hai or ab aap kisi ke saamne mike lagaaiye wo bhi inhen sab muhaavaron main bolne lagata he
 In a way, we will see that the language of TV and newspaper starts coming on people's tongue
 aam log bhi usee tarah sochane bolne lagate hai jis tarah akhbaar or tivi se sikhte hai
 Now just do it here or else our fellow people will get annoyed but these jumle also anchor our channel, i do it myself
 maine kuch koshish kii he
 Some candidates who have fought the elections have asked whether they can say something about themselves which they could not say in front of the public, that if they are angry, then do not vote

 isamen kaha gaya he ki media main khabar aa rahi thi ki rithik-kangana ke email kii jaanch samaapt ho gai he, ye niraadhaar hai
 It has been told in the eye statement from Hrithik's legal team that the truth is that this investigation is still going on
 krime ke joint kamishnar of police, saxena ne rithik roshan ke vakil mahesh jethmalani ko jaankaree di he kiyah kembhi band nahin kiya gaya he
 The investigation is currently underway
 darasal kangana ne yah daawa kiya tha ki wo auraritikrilationships main the or rithik ne unhen kai mels bhi kiye the
 On this, Hrithik lodged a complaint in the cybercrime cell that someone was sending mails to Kangana with my name
 sabooton ke abhaav main is cese ko band kar diya gaya he
 Kangana's source said that Hrithik also went to Paris to propose Kangana
 kisi party main rithik ne hi kangana ko apni mail aaidi di thi
 Hrithik said on the collision with Shahrukh at the box office
 
 
 kahaan se shuru hua maamla:kangana ne pinkavila ko ek intervyuu dete hue 'sili eks' shabd kaa istemaal kiya tha
 In fact, some time ago there was news that Kangana was removed only after being asked by the film 'aashiqui 3'
 jab kangana se is bare main sawaal kiya gaya to unhone kaha tha, 'mujhe kai ajeeb afvaahen sunne ko mil rahi hai
 Even a guesser can guess where these rumors are coming from? i do not know why the Xs do such crazy things to get your attention

 iske thik baad rithik ne twit karke kaha tha ki media jin mahilaon ke saath mere sambandh kaa zikr kar rahaa he, usase zyada sambhaavna he ki meraa sambandh kisi pope ke saath ho
 Now the question arises that Kangana did not even name Hrithik even once, then why did he get so chilly

 My whole world revolves around my breasts

 During a picnic, Wilde's son Silas told his mother, "I think you should sit down and think about what the consequences of what you're doing will be

 Before the Lok Sabha elections, the Narendra Modi government has taken a historic decision to give reservation on the basis of economic status to the general caste
 iske tahat sarkari naukari or shiksha ke kshetra main 10 fisadi aarakshan diya gaya he
 There is no conflict between the government's decision and the 50 percent limit of the Supreme Court (indira Sawhney judgment, 1992)
 kyonki 50 fisadi kii yah seemaa saamaajik or shaikshanik rup se pichhadi jatiyon ko sarkari naukariyon main aarakshan dene ke maamle main he
 It is not in providing reservation to economically weaker sections
 rajyon kii ore dekha jaae to maujuuda vyavastha main sabase zyada aarakshan haryana main diya jaataa he
 There is a total of 70 per cent reservation, while Tamil Nadu has 68, Maharashtra has 68 and Jharkhand 60 per cent
 vahiin, rajasthan main kul 54 fisadi, uttar pradesh main 50 fisadi, bihar main 50 fisadi, madhya pradesh main bhi kul 50 fisadi or pashchim bengal main 35 fisadi aarakshan vyavastha he
 a total of 50 percent reservation is given in Andhra Pradesh
 isamen mahilaon ko 33
 33 percent is additional reservation
 purvottar kii baat kii jaae to arunachal pradesh, meghalaya, nagaland, mizoram main anusuchit janajati ke liye 80 fisadi aarakshan he
 What is the present system of reservation
 
 
 
 Significantly, 15 percent reservation is given to scheduled castes
 jabaki anusuchit janajati ko 7
 There is a 5 percent reservation
 vahiin, 27 pratishat aarakshan anya pichhadaa varg yani ki obisi ko diya jaataa he
 50
 5 pratishat aarakshan anarakshiton ko diya jaataa he
 Steps taken after loss in assembly elections
 
 
 
 According to political experts, the government has taken the step of giving reservation to the upper castes after the defeat of the BJP in Tomadhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh
 aankadon ke anusaar, madhya pradesh ke gwalior-chambal ilaake main jahaan savarna andolan hue vahaan vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko 34 siton main se 7 siten mili thim, jabaki 2013 ke chunaav main yahaan bijepi ne 20 siten jiti thim
 The same situation also existed for BJP in Rajasthan
 rajputabahut ilaakon main bijepi ko nuksaan jhelana padaa
 There were 15 seats here where the margin of victory and defeat was less than the vote of note
 rajya main bijepi-congress ne 41 rajputon ko tikat diya tha jinamein se 17 chunaav jeetne main kaamyaab rahe
 Talking about Chhattisgarh, 2 here
 1 fisadi vot note ko mili
 The biggest thing is that all the upper caste candidates of BJP lost the election

 unke isi chunavi vaade par chandrashekhar ne karaara hamalaa bolaa he
 Bhim Army President Chandrasekhar wrote in his tweet, 'akhilesh Yadav ji, you remember the Ahir Regiment but forgot the Chamar Regiment, while we have been demanding to restore the Chamar Regiment for quite some time

But this job will become Gaurav's throat, Gaurav himself had never thought of it, so Gaurav, associated with journalism, saw many good and bad films as a critic and wrote his review bravely, but where did he know one day One may have to go to see MSG of Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Insan to make hobby work
 Film review: 'MSG' dekhakar samajhie ram rahim or unke kaam kohua kuch yun ki hafte ke shuru main hi unhen is baat kii bhanak pad gai thi ki offis vaale unke khilaaf koi sajeesh rach rahe hai, pehle to unhen laga ki ‘kisi kii muskuraahaton pe ho nisaar’ sareekhee bhaichaare vaali collartun rakhane or aaye din coliyaan bharne vaale unke saathi unke saath aisa kuch galat nahin kar sakate, lekin unka maasoom si shakal vaale apane sahakarmiyon se bharosa us vakt uth gaya jab unhen bos kii taraf se MSG kii samiksha likhane kaa farmaan aa gaya
 As soon as the news was received, the family started chanting the Mahamrityunjaya Mantra in a hurry, this ritual would go on till Gaurav returned to the house safely after watching the film, when we talked to the family, he told Gaurav that childhood The first thing he was fond of was to watch movies, second to go to the army, Gaurav's Kilnia smile was very cute in terms of films and according to the army, 'dush Do not smile are not killed

 Gaurav did not give up so much, just one day before the release of the film, he tagged the forty four people among his fourteen hundred and thirty-two freelance friends on Facebook and wanted to know if anyone could dare to watch MSG with them
 aashcharya is baat kaa ki us post par aath like or chah cament bhi aae, lekin agle din kisi kii beti kaa manthali test tha to kisi kii saas ke jodon main dard

 ye bheed dilli congress ke haare hue sattar netaaon kii thi jo MSG dekh aatmahatya karne aaye the
 On seeing the first dialogue of 'messenger' on the screen, once Gaurav's scream came out, but as time went by, the loud voice of 'papaji' also reduced the fear of Gaurav
 aadhe ghante main unamem vairaygy bhav jagane laga ek ghante baad gaurav samadhi kii avasthaa main the
 Coming out of the theater and taking out the bottle of saline, Gaurav called in a strange voice and told the family that 'today they have come to know the truth, henceforth they should be called Gaurav Chaturvedi
