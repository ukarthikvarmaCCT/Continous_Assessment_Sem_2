 The Prime Minister's Office is surrounded by questions, along with the Law Minister, as well as the Ministry of Coal and the Prime Minister's Office
 26 april ko supreme court main daakhil halafname main sibiai ke doirector ranjit sinha ne mana he ki unhone report ko kanoon mantralay, koyala mantralay or piemo kaarylay se saajha kiya tha
 It is alleged that the CBI had altered the original States report at the behest of the officers of these ministries
 saaf he puure maamle main vipaksh ke hamale jhel rahi upie sarkaar kii mushkilen or badhane vaali hai
 Government worried about hearing The government is worried about the crucial hearing to be held in the Supreme Court on the Koyla scam today
 sutron ke mutabik sarkaar ke bade adhikari is maamle par kanoon visheshgyon kii raay le rahe hai
 It is being told that this week Attorney General GE Vahanvati also met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on this issue
 vipaksh kanoon mantri ashvini kumaar ke istife kii maang kar rahaa he or sarkaar ko maaloom he ki agar supreme court kii ore se koi tikhi tippanee kii jaati he to uske saamne nai musiibat aa jaaegi
 The government, facing the charge of pressurizing the CBI into face-to-face legal officer scandal, is caught in a new problem
 states report ko lekar sarkaar ke do bade kanoonee afasar aamane−saamne aa gaye hai
 According to sources, Additional Solicitor General Harin Rawal has written a 4-page letter to Attorney General Vahanvati, making serious allegations against the Attorney General
 adishnal solicytor general ne vaahnavati par sibiai ke kaamkaaj main dakhsandaji kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Harin Rawal has said in his letter that the Attorney General interfered in many such cases which the CBI is investigating
 adishnal solicytor general ne likhaa he ki unhen bali kaa bakra banaaya ja rahaa he
 BJP got one more chance
 Additional Solicitor General's revelations gave the NBJP another chance to attack the government
 bijepi pravaktaa rajeev pratap rudi ne kaha he ki adishnal solicytor general ke nae khulaase ne sabhi ko anchabhe main daal diya he
 He said that after this disclosure, it has been proved that the Prime Minister is also guilty in the whole case and he should resign immediately
 piem ke istife par adi bijepikoyala ghotaale ko lekar somvaar ko bhi sansad main jamkar hangaamaa hua
 Due to opposition uproar, no work could be done in both the houses
 bijepi ab bhi pradhanmantri ke istife kii maang par adi he
 The BJP has also sought the resignation of the Prime Minister as well as Law Minister Ashwani Kumar
 bijepi ke adiyal rukh ko dekhte hue yah saaf ho gaya he ki is mudde par sansad main gatirodh aage bhi jari rahegaa
 Can there be any other option other than hanging for capital punishment
 supreme court main daakhil ek yachika main faansee ko barbar or amanviya bataate hue maut kii sajaa ke liye anya vikalpon par vichaar karne kii apil kii gai he
 Hanging in the law also means to keep the culprit and bayonet criminal hanging on the noose till the last breath breaks
 adaalat jab kisi doshi ko faansee kii sajaa sunaati he to kahati he 'hang til deth', jiskaa matlab hi hota he doshi ko tab tak faansee par latakaaya jaae jab tak uske sharir main praan baaki he
 But now this petition filed in the Supreme Court has demanded amendment in the law
 yachika main supreme court ke paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth dwaara die gaye ek faisle kaa hawala dete hue kaha gaya he ki peeth ne apane faisle main kaha tha ki moulik adhikaron main garima or sammaan ke saath jeene ke adhikaar ke saath-saath garima or sammaan ke saath marane kaa bhi adhikaar shaamil he
 But hanging is contrary to the right to die with honor, so it should be scrapped and search for an alternative
 yachika main faansee par latakaae rakhane yani 'hang til deth' kaa praavdhaan karne vaali siarpisi kii dhara 354 (5) ko radd karne kii maang kii gai he
 The petitioner has described hanging as the most barbaric way of committing death sentence, as death takes up to 40 minutes due to hanging, while only 2 minutes in a shot or electric chair method
 lau kamishan ne bhi aatankwaad or desh ke khilaaf yuddh ko chhodkar anya sabhi jurmon ke liye sajaa-e-maut ko khatm karne kii sifarish kii thi
 This recommendation was made through the 2015 report last year
 tab 9 main se 6 sadsy isse sahamat the
 Two of the three disagreeing members were representatives of the government
 tatkaaleen vidhi aiji adhyaksh justise api shah ke mutabik report main is baat kaa saaf zikr tha ki aankh ke badale aankh kaa siddhant hamaare samvidhan kii buniyadi bhaavana ke khilaaf he
 Judicial system cannot run with the spirit of revenge
 ayog kii report main yah bhi ullekh he ki 21veen sadi kii duniya main 140 desh faansee kii sajaa khatm kar chuke hai
 In India too, there is a provision for the death penalty only in the rarest and most brutal cases
 lekin khud supreme court ne kai baar mana he ki is siddhant kaa manamaana istemaal bhi hua he
 The Law Commission also advocated life imprisonment instead of punishment-a-death
 haalanki rajya sarkaron ko sajaa main riyaayat baratane kaa akhriyaar he
 But in many states, there is a provision for exemption of punishment after 30 to 60 years in a serious crime, then many states make concession in 14, 16 or 20 years after the prisoner of good conduct
 court is yachika par jald hi sunwaayee kar saktaa he
 Obviously, a bench larger than 5 judges will hear

 He has taken this step after the Air Force refused to give full service
 wing commander puja ne apni yachika main kaha he ki unhen phul sarvice dene se inkaar karne kaa bhartiya vayusena kaa faisla 'purvaagrah se prerit, bhedbhaavpurn, manamaana or puri tarah se anuchit he'
 The Air Force has been asked to respond to the matter in four weeks

 Only last month, the Air Force has inducted the first batch of women fighter pilots, but has been appointed as a Short Service Commission Officer
 iskaa matlab he ki vah adhiktam 14 saal tak seva main rahengi or bina kisi hitlabh ke ritair ho jaaengi
 Permanent commission would mean that women officers should be in service for at least 20 years and get pension
 uske baad jaise jaise pramotion hoga wo aage bad sakati hai
 The comments sutron ke anusaar, wing commander thakur ek prashasnic adhikari hai or 'bhartiya vayusena kii harek branch kaa mahilaon ko sthaayee kamishan dene kaa alag maapdand he

 puja ke vakil kaa kahana he ki yah 'lingabhed se judaa hua maamla nahin he', balki prakriyaagat maamla he

 haryana main karaari haar ke baad bhi congressi netaaon ke bich gutbaji khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahi he
 There is less than three months left in the Haryana Assembly elections, despite the war of dominance between its Congress state president Ashok Tanwar and former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda
 rajya main dalit or jat donon samudaay ko ek saath sadhakar rakhane kii vajah se congress kaa sheersh netritv hooda-tanvar main kisi ke khilaaf karrwai karne se bachati rahi he
 As a result of this, the graph of Congress in Haryana has been falling continuously since 2014
 loksabhaa chunaav main haryana kii sabhi 10 siton par congress ko karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 While the Congress fielded all its veteran leaders of the state, including former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, State President Ashok Tanwar to former Union Minister Kumari Selja
 iske baad bhi congress kaa rajya main khaataa tak nahin khulaa yahaan tak kii rohtak seat bhi haar gaye
 After the humiliating defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, Bhupendra Singh Hooda called his supporters from across the state in Delhi on 9 June and conveyed that in the next one week, the state Congress will be reshuffled and the state Congress will be commanded by his camp
 iske jawaab main pradesh adhyaksh ashok tanvar ne 12 june ko gurugram main kaaryakartaaon kii baithak main hooda par tanj kasate hue bina naam liye kaha tha ki jo aajkal ek saptaah main badlaav kii baat karte hai ve to pichley saadhe chaar saal se yahi baat kehete aa rahe hai, lekin aaj tak koi badlaav nahin kara sake
 Actually, the battle for political supremacy between Ashok Tanwar and Bhupendra Singh Hooda is not today but has been going on for the last several years
 is gutbaji se congress ko 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa or phir 2014 main hi rajya kii apni satta gavanni padi or bijepi pehali baar apane dam par purna bahumat ke saath satta main viramaan hui
 To end factionalism in the party, the Congress top leadership made hooda-tanwar travel in a bus from Delhi to Haryana just before the Lok Sabha elections 2019, even after this, the war of political supremacy between the two leaders has not diminished
 iskaa khamiyaja loksabhaa chunaav main party ko uthaanaa padaa
 The Congress has refrained from taking any action against Bhupendra Hooda and Tanwar after losing one election after another in Haryana
 iske peeche donon netaaon ke jati votbank vajah he
 The state has 25 per cent Jat and 20 per cent Dalit voters
 yahi vajah he ki kisi ek ke khilaaf karrwai kii gai to duusare samudaay ko logon ke bich galat sandesh jayega
 And in the same situation, the Congress' lootia is drowning in Haryana
 congress nae prayog kii taiyaari menharyana main congressi diggajon kii gutbaji khatm karne ko lekar haikaman nayaa prayog karne kii taiyaari main he
 Former Union Minister Kumari Selja could benefit in the battle of former cms Bhupendra Singh Hooda and Ashok Tanwar in the state
 haryana main party kii kaman tanvar ke haathon se lekar kumari shailaja ko saunpkar dalit votaron ko saadhane kii koshish hogi
 At the same time, the Congress high command may also wager to make three working state presidents with the intention of tying all the groups together
 vahiin, jat samudaay ko saadhane kii disha main bhupendra singh hooda ko vidhayak dal kaa netaa banaaya ja saktaa he
 While a sister is yet to be known, the police suspect that Raju has a complete gang and may be related to the same gang
 dakshin africa ke haathon paanchaven or aakhri vanade main 214 ran se mili haar ke baad bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne ek baar phir ‘prakriya’ par focus karne par jor dete hue kaha he ki team ko dharre par laane ke liye kuch masale jaldi hal karne honge
 In response to South Africa's 438 for four, India were bowled out for 224 in 36 overs
 dhoni ne match ke baad kaha, ‘main jaanata hum ki bharat main sabhi nateeja chaahate hai lekin prakriya par dhyaan nahin dene se nattejey nahin milenge
 This is a difficult situation
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘lekin ham hal bhi talash rahe hai
 We will have to try some more things because even if we do the same, the results will be same
 ’ dakshin africa ne bharat main pehali dwipaksheeya ek divasiy shrinkhalaa jiti he
 Earlier, he also won the T20 series 2–0
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘hamen bade str par dekhnaa hoga varanaa aap ikki dukki shrinkhlaayen jeet sakate hai
 a stable and balanced team is required for consistent good performance
 hamaari team main uski kami lag rahi he
 Dhoni, who was facing criticism for the change in batting order, said that he had to find different solutions for different situations
 unhone kaha, ‘aapako maidan, wicket or halaat ke anuroop badlaav karne hote hai
 i made some changes in the batting order to make it stronger
 ’akshar patel or ravindra jadeja sabase umdaa spin gendbaaj harfanmauladhoni ne yah bhi kaha ki sirf ek vanade main aajamaaye gaye stuart binni sarvshereshth seem gendbaaji harfanmaulaa hai jabaki akshar patel or ravindra jadeja sabase umdaa spin gendbaaj harfanmaulaa hai
 He said, 'we will keep saying that we do not have seam bowler all-rounder
 hamane stuart ko aajamaaya to logon ne uski bhi aalochana kii lekin vah desh kaa sarvshereshth seem gendbaaj harfanmaulaa he jabaki jadeja or akshar sabase umdaa spin gendbaaj harfanmaulaa hai
 "we have to find ways to get the best bowling combination, but batting cannot be taken lightly for that," he said
 in samasyaon kaa hal talashna hoga
 Dhoni said, 'the good thing is that we have time now but we have to find players for these places
 hamen aise khilaadiyon ko talashna hoga jo antarrashtriya cricket kaa dabaav jhel sake or ek baar kaamyaab hone par kaam aasaan ho jaayegaa
 He also defended the decision to field medium pacers Mohit Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who conceded 84 and 106 runs respectively
 captain ne kaha, ‘hamane tej gendbaajon ko bhi aajamaaya jinke paas raftaar thi lekin ve zyada ran de rahe the lihaaja hamane madhyam tej gendbaajon ko utaara
 Mohit should be the third seamer but you have to choose who will be the death bowler, who will bowl the middle overs and who will handle the new ball
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘hamane kai tej gendbaaj aajamaaye jinka pradarshan acha nahin rahaa lekin dalip trophy, devdhar trophy yaa ipel main ve acha khel rahe hai
 "the performance was so bad that they couldn't even call it bad
 Dhoni joked that the bowlers' performance was so bad yesterday that they can't even call it bad
 unhone kaha, ‘dakshin africa ballebaajon ne sapaat wicket par acchhee saajhedaariyaan kii
 No strategy could work against them
 main ise kharaab pradarshan nahin kahuunga kyonki yah usase bhi bura tha
 'asking where the mistake was in the match, he said,' Don't ask these questions today, where did the mistake go in the match, made around 450 runs and you ask where the mistake was made
 kuch kaich chute hai, gendbaaji main kamiyaan rahi
 We controlled for 20-25 overs but after that they scored 10, 12, 15 runs per over
 438 yaa 440 ran kaa lakshya aasaan nahin hota
 'he said,' He batted well
 hamen bhi saajhedaariyaan banani chaiye thi or puure 50 over khilne chaiye the
 Success comes many times, many times not
 ’ dhoni ne vanade cricket main terning wicket banane kaa suzav dete hue kaha, ‘yah wicket ballebaaji ke liye acha tha lekin spinneron ko koi turn nahin mila
 This wicket neither helped our spinners nor the fast bowlers
 yahi vajah he ki unhone itane ran banaaye kyonki chaukon chhakkon par roak lagaana mushkil ho gaya tha
 'he said,' You will not find turning wickets in Johannesburg or anywhere else
 hamaari takat alag he or uske anuroop hi wicket hone chaiye

 Kedarnath is one of the Char Dham of Hindus
 vahaan kii yatra bahut durgam he
 In 2013, there was a disaster, which shook the entire country
 ajtak ke patrkaar manjit negi ne kedarnath haadase kii ankhondekhi reporting kii or punarnirmaan ke dauraan bhi vah lagaataar kedarnath jate rahe
 Then on his experiences he wrote a book, named 'interview with Kedarnath
 'yah kitaab kedarnath kii puranic mahatta se adhik us haadase se judi he or iske mahatva ko aise samaj sakate hai ki khud pradhanmantri narendra modi ne isaki tarif karte hue likhaa, 'kedaar traasadee kii darun gaatha, jeevat patrakarita kaa pathneey sankalan'
 On the author's stage of the World Book Fair at Pragati Maidan, 'sahitya Aaj Tak' spoke to Manjeet Negi and Nitin Soni of Hafcro, the publisher of this book
 'sahitya ajtak' ke anya satron kii tarah is satr ke sanchaalan kaa jimmaa bhi ajtak ke ankar said ansaari ne uthaaya
 World Book Fair 2019: Where is what in the fair, you can read here the whole detail
 Manjit Negi showed the picture drawn on the same day at 5 pm to the audience before talking on the book
 unhone june 2013 kii us ghatana ko yaad karte hue use pralay qaraar diya or kaha ki sarkari aankadon main paanch hajaar log maare gaye, par gaiyrsarkari aankadon or vahaan mere ek maah ke pravaas ke anubhavon se main yah kah saktaa hum ki us traasadee main kareeb das hajaar log shikaar hue the
 It was a different reporting experience in my seventeen-year journalism career
 manjit ne bataaya ki is haadase ke baad jab main vahaan pahunchaa to shaam kaa samay tha
 Everything manmade except the temple was destroyed
 mandir ke baahar nandi ji ke paas bisapachhis shav bikhare hue the
 Having courage, went inside the temple and tried to find it
 andar shav nahin the
 When i went to Kedarnath for the first time, when i tried to find a Shiva lingam in the temple by hand searching in the dark, a big rock appeared
 mandir ke andar baahar kii tabaahi kaa koi asar nahin tha
 After that i went there many times with the grace of Baba Kedarnath and wrote this book on my experiences
 hafakro ke prakaashak nitin soni kaa kahana tha ki hamaare paas jab bhi kitaaben prakaashan ke liye aati hai, to unhen padhane ke baad ham sampadakeey team ko bhejte hai or vah faisle leti he
 But when the book 'interview with Kedarnath' came to me, i had tears in my eyes after reading half
 maine is haadase ko tivi par dekha tha
 But this book was different
 is kitaab kii sabase acchhee baat yah he ki yah vidhwans se nirmaan kii ore badhati he
 It shows the courage and hard work of a journalist and army
 iske saath hi aasthaa ke mahatva kaa bhi pataa chalata he
 The book was doing well, now a film was also made on it
 kedarnath haadase ke peeche manavnirmit nirmaan ko jimmedaar tehraate hue sanchaalak said ansaari ne lekhak manjit negi kaa mat poocha to unka jawaab tha, is aapadaa ke peeche ek sandesh tha
 When you look at the picture of Kedarnath, a 1962 photo appears on Google, in which apart from the temple, there is nothing but a few huts in the entire Kedar valley
 2013 tak aate-aate vahaan itane nirmaan ho chuke the ki kedarnath or haridwar ek jaisaa lagane lage the
 While Kedarnath was the abode of Nirvana
 vishwa pustak mela 2019: meley main kahaan kya he, yahaan pard sakate hai puri detailmanjit negi ne saaf shabdon main kaha ki yah traasadee shaayad shiv kii taraf se ek sandesh tha ki mandir ke alaava vah vahaan kuch bhi nahin chaahate the
 He elaborated his point and told the audience that during the accident you must have heard about a divine rock
 traasadee ke din jab vahaan mandakini or saraswati main baadh ai, jisaki vajah se puri kedarnath ghati tabah ho gai thi, tab us dhara ke saath ek shila bhi ai thi, jo mandir ke peeche ruk gai
 Due to that rock, the streams of the river split into two parts and they destroyed everything that was there except the temple
 ab jab vahaan punarnirmaan kaa kaam ho rahaa he to is baat kaa dhyaan rakhaa ja rahaa he
 Asked if he had included all his experiences in this book
 manjit kaa jawaab tha ki bahut sari baaten chhot gai hai
 One incident that he remembers was that when we were going again trekking through the old road, the Rambara where people used to stop going to Kedarnath was not even known
 jabaki haadase kii raat vahaan takreeban paanch hajaar log the
 We found the bodies of families all along the way
 alam yah he ki aaj bhi rambada se kedarnath tak logon ke shav milte hai
 According to Manjit, the state government probably did not realize that such a big holocaust took place there
 rajya sarkaar ne shuruaati teen dinon main kadam uthaae hote kuch jane or bachaai ja sakati thi
 At least those who died of cold or hunger
 sena kii himmat or patibaddhta kii tarif karte hue manjit negi ne nitin soni ke aagrah par ek kissa bhi sunaaya
 Told that a horse was stuck in an island for a week in that catastrophic flood
 saat-aath dinon se use khaane ke liye kuch mila nahin tha
 The army decides to save him
 kisi tarah se ek ptch par helicopter roka gaya
 The people of NDRF somehow reached by the rope
 ghode ko laakar helicopter ke donon taraf ke daravaaje kholkar andar rakhaa gaya
 We were asked to stand with me and my cameraman on both sides
 hamen dar tha ki ghoda jaraa bhi hilaa to ham sidhe neeche
 But the horse did not act without any hunger and thirst
 phir bhi raste bhar ham hanuman chalisa padhate rahe or ham use lekar raahat centre tak pahunchane main safal rahe
 The debate on 'growing intolerance' in the country continues in Parliament
 congress kii ore se mudda uthaae jane par sansadeey kaary mantri venkaiya naidu ne kaha ki 'sarkaar kisi bhi mudde par bahes ke liye taiyaar he
 But writers should also take care of others' buildings
 kitabon or filmon par bain ke liye policy ho
 When there was an uproar over it, the speaker said that at least we should not show intolerance in the House
 hangaame ke kaaran loksabhaa ko chaar baar sthagit karnaa padaa
 As the debate progressed, CPI (M) MP Mohammad Salim accused Home Minister Rajnath Singh of making extremely objectionable statements
 saleem ne kathith taur par rajnath kaa yah bayaan sadan main doharaaya
 This was about calling the PM a Hindu
 iske baad hangaamaa bad gaya
 Rajnath asked Salim - 'when and where did i say that?' On this, Salim showed a copy of the Outlook magazine of November 16, 2014, in which this statement was printed
 iske baad is bayaan ko sansadeey kaarywahi ke record se hataa diya gaya
 Earlier, the proceedings of the house did not stop at 2 pm
 05 baje tak sthagit kar di gai
 Rajnath also asked Salim to apologize for this statement
 rajnath ne kya kaharajanath ne kaha ki mohammad saleem ke bayaan se main bahut adhik aahat hua hum
 i have never been so upset during my entire political career
 saleem ko apana bayaan waapas lenaa chahie or iske liye maafee maangani chahie
 Congress demands two days of discussion: Congress has demanded that at least two days should be kept to discuss intolerance, so that everyone gets a chance to speak

 The main opposition party also proposed a moratorium on inflation
 isse pehle congress ne kaha tha ki jab tak is mudde par charchaa nahin hoti, kisi bhi bill par baat nahin hogi
 Accepting the demand, the speaker gave 12 noon time to discuss the issue
 12 baje prashnkaal khatm ho gaya
 Raut said - Even before the debate started in the Congress era, Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut said that as much as there was intolerance at the political-social level in the Congress era, it never happened in the world
 congress wo din bhul gai kya? haalanki rajyasabha main abhi ambedkar par charchaa jari he
 Intolerance may be discussed in the Upper House two days later
 bijepi ne kaha- apane din bhul gai congresssansadeey kaary mantri venkaiya naidu ne phir apni puraani baat doharaai
 Also questioned the authors' return of the award
 naidu ne kaha ki congress apane din bhul gai kya, jab apatkaal ke dauraan sanvaidhanik or mul adhikaar tak chin liye gaye the
 The writer then remained silent and is now expressing anger
 desh main puri sahishnutaa he

 i started a job at HDFC in 1978
 us samay main 26 saal kii thi
 This was my first job
 mujhe lagata he ki is sanghathan ke saath main bhi badi hoti gai (echdiefasi kaa gathan 1977 main hua tha)
 There were two big moments in my career and the same happened with this organization
 pehla yah ki hamaare bijness ke tareeke main badlaav aayaa
 Our way of thinking changed at HDFC
 haalanki in faislon ko lene main samay laga lekin usase hamaare kaarobaar main bahut bada fark aayaa
 Housing loan has become a common necessity today
 log apane computer kaa mouse clic karke bade aasaani se karj le sakate hai
 But when we started, customers were worried whether they would get a loan or not
 us samay karj kii maatra adhiktam 70,000 ru
 Used to be lekin yah rakam bhi graahakon ke liye kisi vardaan se kam nahin hoti thi
 If they got a loan, they would invite us to their home entrance
 agra, meerut, kanpur jaise shaharon ke graahak karj lene ke liye dilli aate the
 In the 1980s, when i was a middle-level employee in management, we planned to provide loans to customers in their city as well
 lekin iske liye hamen apni shakhaaen badhaani padatin
 The opening of a branch meant that 25-30 employees would be placed there
 ek chote shahar main yah phaayde kaa sauda nahin tha, kyonki kaarobaar itnaa zyada nahin tha
 So we started the hub-and-spoke model
 hamaare pehle spoke main sirf do yaa teen karmchaaree the
 Customers came to contact them and the rest of the work was done from Delhi
 hamane sabase pehla spoke kanpur main kholaa tha or dilli main pehla spoke india habitat centre main kholaa tha
 Spoke used to collect customers' papers and send them to Delhi's main office
 tab tak technology main zyada pragati nahin hui thi
 The files were then sent by courier
 dhire-dhire spoke apane aap main shakha banate gaye
 As a result, we had many offices
 vistaar karne kaa tarika bahut kargar rahaa or laagat bhi kam hoti thi
 Today, 40 percent of our business is being done in mid-scale cities
 logon ke kaano-kaan prachaar se hamaari pratishtha teji se badhati gai
 Today we have 25 hubs and about 250 spokes
 doosraa badlaav hamaari jarurat ke kaaran aayaa tha
 This was a big change in the thinking of HDFC
 hamane kabhi apane or graahakon ke bich kisi bichauliye kaa istemaal karne main yakeen nahin kiya
 Our relationship with customers has always been cordial
 lekin 10 saal pehle pratispardhaa badaae lagi or duusare bainkon ke apane pratinidhi graahakon ke ghar par hi unase sampark karne ke liye pahunchane lage or unke offis bhi graahakon kii suvidha ke anusaar der tak khule rahane lage
 This affected our business
 shuru main to hamane koshish kii ki agent na rakhe jaaen
 But our effort was not beneficial
 isliye hamane kuch alag karne kii baat sochi
 We decided to hire an agent, but their job was to collect only the necessary paper from the customers and tell them about the terms of the loan, while the decision to give the loan was on us
 ham ab bhi karj dene ke samay graahak se sidhe milane par jor dete hai
 We started with a few agents in Delhi
 lekin hamane jaldi hi mahasoos kiya ki hamen aise log rakhane chahie jo hamase judaav rakhte hon
 That is why we started HDFC Sales Company
 yah echdiefasi kii sau fisadi sahaayak company he or yah saat-aath saal puraani he
 Its employees consider themselves part of the company
 is prakaar kisi tarah kaa galat karj dene kii bhaavana nahin rah gai
 When i remember the old thing, there is great satisfaction that i have also been a partner in preparing the plan for the growth of the company

 uske baad maine unase baat nahin kii
 It looks like someone is taking advantage of my name

 Nowadays the job market has become quite competitive
 job paane ke liye kaaphi mashkkat kerani padati he
 And when it comes to job interviews, it becomes important to take care of many things
 agar aap chaahate hai ki aapkaa intervyuu safal rahe, to uske liye aapako kai tarah kii taiyaariyaan karnaa jaruri he
 For example, while giving an interview, you should know when, where, what to say
 aapaki kahi hui ek galat baat aapako nai job se kaaphi dur le ja sakati he
 We are telling you 5 such things which you do not have to mention at the time of interview
 1
 What is the policy regarding annual leave and sick leave of the company? 'don't forget to ask this question at the time of interview
 agar aap intervyuu ke samay hi yah sawaal kar denge to lagegaa hair hone ke baad lambii chuttee par jane vaale hai
 2
 intervyuu dete samay kabhi bhi politics or dharm par charchaa na karen
 Instead, tell yourself about what kind of person you are and what you have to do in life later
 lekin dhyaan rahe ki apane bare main bad-chadh na bataaen
 Never forget to discuss these two topics in your interview
 3
 'where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?' If you are asked this question in the interview, do not say that you want to stay in this job
 isse lagegaa ki aap aage badhanaa nahin chaahate
 So, answer it in such a way that you will fulfill the responsibilities given to you and will fulfill the goals ahead of your life
 4
 'how was your boss in the previous company? 'no matter how bad your relationship may be from the previous company, but don't forget to say anything wrong about that company or boss
 agar aap intervyuu ke dauraan puraani company yaa bos kii buraai kar rahe hai to intervyuu lene waalon pataa chal jayega ki aap kitne anprofeshnal hai
 Not only this, they will also understand about your character
 5

 The result of this was that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP fielded Colonel Sonaram Choudhary instead of giving ticket to Jaswant Singh from Barmer
 jaswant ke tikat katane ke peeche vasundhara raaje ko mukhya kaaran mana gaya tha
 Jaswant Singh contested elections independently after not getting a ticket from BJP

 At the same time, Manvendra Singh refused to have Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje's Gaurav Yatra in his constituency Shiva
 jodhpur sambhag main yatra ke pehle charan se maanavendra ne puri tarah se duuri banaae rakhi he
 This can explain their displeasure

 We came on the invitation of Movement Against 8lane Way
 We were prevented from going to meet farmers, phones snatched, manhandled and pushed into police van
 First hand experience of police state in TN! - Yogendra Yadav (@_yogendrayadav) September 8, 2018 Video of this entire incident was made by one of his companions

 phone par baat ke minuton baad police ne hamen hiraasat main liya
 Yadav said that the Superintendent of Police of Thiruvannamalai told me that my presence could lead to deterioration of law and order, unrest and hence i was detained
 maine kaha ki main sirf kisaanon ke gharon main jaaoongaa lekin espi ne kaha ki mujhe nahin jane diya jayega
 It seems, Gandhi's civil disobedience is only one way
 i had spoken to Mr Kandasamy, Collector, Thiru Annamalai about acquisition and complains of police excesses for 8 lane way
 He completely denied any police interference
 Within minutes of the phone call police detained us

 Opposing the question of caste in the census to be held in the country this time, intellectuals have appealed to citizens to write Hindustani instead of caste
 jati aadhaarit janaganana par hui ek sangoshtee main purv kendriya mantri aarif mohammad khan ne kaha ki logon ko jati aadhaarit janaganana kaa bahishkaar karte hue jati ke sthaan par hindustani ingit karnaa chahie
 On this occasion, intellectuals decided to oppose the caste-based census by running a campaign
 unhone kaha ki ‘meri jati hindustani’ naam se yah abhiyaan chalaakar logon ko jaagruk karne kaa kaam kiya jayega
 Former Secretary of the Ministry of External Affairs JC Sharma, former Union Minister Khan and others also decided to form a committee to take this campaign to the common man
 khan ne kaha, ‘‘agar chaar yaa paanch karod log hi apni jati ke sthaan par hindustani likh dete hai, to yah badi safalataa hogi or yah anya logon ko yah apnaane main madad karegi
 He said that the number of people who consider their caste as Hindustani is not small, but such people have not been able to organize at the moment
 is abhiyaan se aise logon ko ekajute karne kaa kaam kiya jayega
 The intellectuals present in the seminar believe that caste-based census is a conspiracy to divide the country
 haalanki unhone kaha ki agar koi apni jati kaa ullekh karnaa hi chahta he, to vah iskaa virodh nahin karenge
 Senior journalist Ved Pratap Vaidik said that now people need a new caste and that caste is 'indianness'
 yah ek aisi jati he jo janm se nahin balki apni ichha se chuni jaati he
 The Modi government at the Center has changed its strategy regarding Jammu and Kashmir
 centre or rajya sarkarein jammu kashmir ke sabhi pakshon se baatcheet ke liye taiyaar ho gai he

 purv ibi pramukh dineshwar sharma centre kii ore se pratinidhitiv karenge
 He said that Dinesh Sharma will talk to everyone
 unhone kaha kijammu kashmir ke liye centre or rajya sarkaar donon sanjidahain

 He said that Dineshwar Sharma will hold talks with all the parties and submit his report to the Center and the government
 grahamantri ne kaha ki dineshwar sharma ko cabinet secretary kaa states hoga
 With whom does Dineshwar Sharma speak? iske liye unke paas puri aazaadee hogi
 Dineshwar Sharma will understand the ambition of the people and will work accordingly

 When Home Minister Rajnath Singh was asked if the Chief Representative would also hold direct talks with the Hurriyat leaders, he did not give a direct answer and said that Dineshwar Sharma will have full freedom to talk to whom he will solve the Kashmir problem
 Have to do

 On the remarks of Congress Party Vice President Rahul Gandhi on the controversial ordinance of the Indian government brought to the rescue of tainted public representatives, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that these issues will be considered when he returns home
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi jab adhyadesh kii teevr ninda karte hue use ‘purnataya bakawaas’ bataa rahe the us vakt pradhanmantri yahaan ‘four sijans hotel’ ke apane suite main so rahe the
 The Cabinet has recently approved the ordinance brought to protect convicted mps and mlas, disregarding the Supreme Court order immediately disqualifying them
 tippaniyan The Prime Minister's colleague woke up when contacted by the media to seek feedback on Rahul's attack and his remarks that the ordinance was described as 'wrong'
 adhyadesh philhal manjuuri ke liye raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ke paas he
 There is no immediate response but sources in the Prime Minister's Office said that the Prime Minister will 'deal with the matter only after returning to New Delhi on October 1
 ’ raashtrapati baraak obama ke saath hone vaali pradhanmantri kii baithak kii taiyaariyon main jute unke sahyogi ghabara jarur gaye lekin vah koi bhi saarvajanik tippanee karne se bache
 The Prime Minister was sleeping in his suite of 'four Seasons Hotel' here when Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi was strongly condemning the ordinance and calling it 'complete nonsense'

 jharkhand kii raajnneeti hameshaa se ashaant samudr kii tarah rahi he
 In such a situation, no one was surprised when after the defeat of the NDA on the prestigious Jamshedpur seat, many kinds of speculations started to get air
 jharkhand mukti morcha (jhamumo) pramukh ne yah suzav dekar dhamaakaa kar diya ki mukhyamantri pad par adla-badali honi chahie lekin bhaajapa ne yah kah kar unke suzav ko nirast kar diya ki ranchi main sheersh pad par koi saudebaaji nahin hone vaali
 While Babulal Marandi's Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JHVIMO) is increasing its acceptance, Chief Minister Arjun Munda is busy strengthening his friendly relations with very understanding and weakening enemies
 10 agast yani ek hi din main munda ne do jabardast chaalen chalin
 While he made Shibu Soren the status of cabinet minister by making him the head of the State Coordination Committee, he recommended a CBI probe into major irregularities in Madhu Koda's tenure in the centrally sponsored rural electrification project that could expose the Congress
 kyonki us samay kii sarkaar ko upie kaa samarthan hasil tha
 Apart from these headlines, this is also the time to focus on the two young ministers of Jharkhand - they certainly look very calm from above, but are working well to strengthen their roots inside
 beshak sabaki nigahen jharkhand ke up-mukhyamantri sudesh kumaar mahato or aabkaari evam aapadaa prabandhan mantri gopal krishna paatar urf raja peter par tiki hui hai
 37-year-old Deputy Chief Minister of Jharkhand, Sudesh Mahato is the ideal symbol of his water resources department
 behate pani kii tarah, sudesh bhi bahane kii nai raahen talashte hai or nae sansadhano kaa nirmaan karte hai
 In the recent by-election for Jamshedpur Lok Sabha seat, his chosen candidate Aastik Mahato garnered 99,058 votes, spoiling the game of BJP and JMM
 ajasu kaa yah pradarshan is baat kaa dyotak he ki kaise yah yuva netaa jharkhand kii nai simaaon main prabhaavshaalee upasthiti darj kara rahaa he
 Mahato has already shown how they are touching new boundaries in Jharkhand
 singhbhum kshetra main behatar pradarshan ke baavjood, unhone ol india students union (ageesu-ajasu) ke sammelan ke liye rajya ke ek duusare kone bokaro ko chunaa
 Over time, the venue of the conference is also of great importance
 ajasu ke chandankiyaari or ramgarh main pehle se hi vidhayak hai lekin koyale se samrudh is ilaake main use nai safaltaaen hasil kerani hai
 Mahato's image of a leader who is eyeing the ground has been reinforced once again and this time this opportunity has come to Ajsu to play the displacement card during the conference to connect those people who are off their land in the name of industrialization Has to wash hands sammelan main mahato garaje, ''visthaapan or punarvaas ko turant tavajjo die jane kii jarurat he
 Establishment of a large number of industries is bound to happen, but the government must also provide alternative employment and housing for the displaced before approving them
 ''rajnatik prastaav ke jariye ajasu ne ek samiti kaa gathan kiya he jo masale kaa jayja legi or sarkaar se jaruri kadam uthaane ko kahegi
 It is clear from Mahato's address that AJSU is committed to leave its mark on the issue of displacement victims, both politically and emotionally
 unhone kaha, ''vibhinn ilaake, jinamein bokaro, jamshedpur, ranchi, koyalanchal or anya bhi shaamil hai, visthaapan kii samasya jhel rahe hai
 We will visit all these places and meet the displaced people and try to reduce their problems
 '' aisa lagata he ki mahato chote kshetron main hasil karne yogya lakshyon par hi dhyaan kendrit karnaa chaahate hai
 The biggest advantage is the credibility of this young leader
 ve aasaani se sthapit partiyon ke janaadhar main send laga sakate hai kyonki ve bharosa jagaate hai
 Not only this, Mahato will probably be the only MLA from a small party who has never changed
 mahato ne 2005 main arjuna munda kii sarkaar girane ke baad 2009 ke nae chunaav hone tak vipaksh main baithna manjuur kiya
 During this time three governments came in the state but they did not change
 sudesh kaa rajg se chunaav se pehle koi rajnatik samajhaita nahin rahaa lekin unhone apni vaicharik patibaddhta ko nibhaayaa he
 Expressing their confidence in Mahato, 30,000 youths have joined AJSU in the last ten months and are looking to enhance their party for the future
 unke katu aalochak bhi unhen sayaanaa raajnneetik or kushal prabandhak maanate hai jo akele hi apni party ko chalaa rahe hai
 He was the lone MLA of the party in the days of undivided Bihar
 mahato kii party ne 2005 ke chunaav main do siten jeetin or phir 2009 ke vidhansabha chunaav main 5 siton tak pahunch gaye haalanki teen siton par unke ummidavaar duusare sthaan par rahe
 In this era of unstable coalition, the AJSU chief clearly wants to step forward and strengthen his support base in Jharkhand, where many parties and leaders have lost their trust
 kaam kaa chiterabaat pichley saptaah kii he, sachivalay se lautate samay jharkhand ke aabkaari evam aapadaa prabandhan mantri gopal krishna paatar urf raja peter ne sadak kinare ek dukaan par gaadi roki or chatnee ke saath samose khaane main mashgool ho gaye
 a stranger came to them and handed them a piece of paper
 samosa khaane ke baad peter ne kaagaj ko kholaa-is ummid ke saath kisi ne sifarish kii darkhwaast kii hogi
 But there was only one line written in that letter - "please do something for Jharkhand; We know that we can count on you
 ''aise samay jab jharkhand ke netaaon ko lekar bharosa apane nimnatam str par he, raja bharosa jagaa rahe hai
 Ironically, Peter is gaining popularity at a time when his party Janata Dal (united) in Jharkhand is getting away with it
 bihar ikai ke ulat jad (you) yahaan apni chhavi ko ganvaa rahi he
 The party is reduced to two mlas in the 82-member assembly
 jharkhand main nitish ko beasar banane vaale kai avaanchit tatv maujuud hai
 Many leaders are from the era of Samata Party in the party, who are proving to be completely unacceptable
 isamen hairat nahin ki party main abhi nae peter, use mushkil se nikaalane ke kaam main lage hai
 Although Nitish Kumar is liked by a large number of people in Jharkhand, but his party has not been able to strengthen its base here
 party 2009 ke chunaav main 18 siton par ladi thi, lekin sirf do hi jeet saki thi
 Not only this, independents won more seats than JD (U) in Jharkhand
 jad (you) kaa jharkhand main dhimi raftaar se hi sahi lekin pichhadanaa jari he
 Where senior leaders like Inder Singh Namdhari and Radha Krishna Kishore have left the party and the party's traditional support base has deteriorated due to weak leadership in the state
 jhavimo or ageesu sareekhee partiyaan jad (you) ke janaadhar main send lagaakar apana aadhaar majboot karne main lagi hui hai
 Clearly, Jaleshwar Mahato, who was the long-time party president in the state and who recently resigned, cannot blame anyone else for the party's misery in Jharkhand
 jaleshwar hi jharkhand main bhaajapa-jad (you) main pareshaaniyaan paidaa karne ke jimmedaar maane ja rahe the, jisaki vajah se rajya main bade str par bharose main kami aa rahi thi
 Party sources believe that Nitish Kumar will not allow the party to decline further in the state
 peter 2009 main us samay surkhiyon main aae the jab unhone tatkaaleen mukhyamantri shibu sorain ko tamaad upachunaav main haraa diya tha
 At that time he contested from Jharkhand Party
 nitish se prerit hokar ve jad (you) main shaamil ho gaye or tamaad se jad (you) ummidavaar ke taur par unhone chunaav ladaa
 Against the opposition of Jaleshwar faction, Nitish made him a minister in the Arjun Munda cabinet
 jaleshwar kaa istipha bhi ek rahasy bana hua he kyonki koi nahin jaanata ki unhone yah kadam kyon uthaaya
 But it is clear that he decided to resign from the party at a critical time when JD (U) is trying to politically establish itself in the state
 unki kaam ke prati patibaddhta unke aalochakon kaa munh band kar detii he
 Peter's rapid mobility and ever-increasing popularity also provoke political jealousy towards him in roughly the same proportion
 party main or party ke baahar kai rajnatik avyav aise bhi he jo unki ubhartee chhavi se parashaan he lekin nitish kumaar ko jad (you) ke jharkhand main vistaar ke liye shaayad peter hi sahi vikalp lagate hai
 Pakistan's weekly magazine 'friday Times' has made a shocking disclosure
 magazine ke anusaar saudi arab ke crown prince mohammad bin salmaan sanyukt raashtra yatra ke dauraan pakistani pradhanmantri imran khan ke kuch kaaryaklap se itane naaraaz ho gaye the ki unhone imran ko america se swadesh waapas laa rahe vimaan ko bich raste se hi waapas lautne kaa aadesh diya tha
 Imran first visited Saudi Arabia during his visit to the United States to attend the United Nations General Assembly
 vah saudi arab se vanijyik vimaan se america janaa chaah rahe the
 But, bin Salman said that it could not be, Imran is his special guest and he will fly to America with his special private plane
 imran embs ke vimaan se america gaye the
 He was returning from the same place when it was reported that his plane had to be diverted to the United States due to a technical glitch and Imran was back on commercial flight
 ab 'friday times' ne yah kahkar chaunkaaya he ki koi takneekee gadabadi nahin thi, yah embs kii naaraazgi thi jisaki vajah se imran ke vimaan ko lautnaa padaa
 The Pakistan government spokesperson dismissed the report of the 'friday Times' and expressed its deep regret and said it was an attempt to put Imran's 'successful journey' under suspicion
 'friday times' ne apni report main kaha, 'har haal main imran khan ke prashansak bane rahane waalon ne neuyork se lautne par unka vijeta hero jaisaa swaagat kiya
 Even the suggestion came from their side that the commercial aircraft from which Imran is returning from Jeddah to Islamabad should be brought under the siege of F-17 Thunder aircraft to pay tribute to Imran
 ' 'friday times' ne apni report main kaha, 'in samarthakon ko lagata he ki imran ne kashmir, islamophobia jaise sabhi khaas muddon par dhardaar tareeke se baat rakhi
 He did not mind that (when Imran was speaking) the hall was half empty and he assumed that Pakistan used to train al-qaeda terrorists
 unhen isse fark nahin padataa ki bharat-pakistan samvaad kii ummid pehle se kahin kam ho gai he or ek kshetreey mudda islamic pakistan or hindu bharat kaa mudda bana diya gaya he
 "the Friday Times" wrote, "the visit also had some unintended consequences
 saudi crown prince mohammad bin salmaan neuyark main pakistani pradhanmantri kii kootneeti ke kuch pahaluon se itane alag ho gaye ki unhone apane nijee vimaan ko waapas bulaakar or usamen se pakistani pratinidhimandal ko nikalwakar bajaahir imran ko jhidak diya
 He (bin Salman) could not be happier with the possibility that the Islamic bloc should be jointly represented by Imran Khan, (president of Turkey) Recep Tayyip Erdogan and (prime Minister of Malaysia) Mahathir Mohammad and without his (bin Salman's) former Pakistan will agree to increase its agreement with Iran
 'pakistan sarkaar ke pravaktaa ne 'friday times' kii soochna par kadi aapatti jataate hue ise galat bataaya he
 He said, 'the news of the Saudi Crown Prince recalling Imran's plane back from Canada to the US is concocted
 pakistan or saudi arab ke shaskaon ke bich behtareen sambandh he
 The report seeks to undermine the Prime Minister's successful interaction with world leaders
 turki or malaysia ke netaaon se pradhanmantri kii mulaakaat par apane man se nateeja nikaal liya gaya he
 The purpose of this report is to attack the relationship between two countries having fraternal relations for political gains

 He is well aware of Mexico's performance and will aim to attack the team's defense
 fifa world cap main ab tak mexico ne keval do baar hi quarter final tak kaa safar tay kiya he
 She entered the final-8 in 1970 and 1986, while Brazil reached the quarter-finals 13 times
 aise main mexico ke liye brazil ke khilaaf jeet hasil kar antim-8 tiimon main sthaan hasil kar paanaa itnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Although the tournament started slow at the group level for Brazil, it improved its game and performed well in the remaining two group matches and made it to the pre-quarterfinals
 mexico ne apane pehle group match main germany ko 1-0 se haraakar yah sabit kar diya tha ki uske dephence ko tod paanaa kisi bhi team ke liye aasaan nahin hoga
 However, Mexico lost to Sweden in their third group match after defeating South Korea
 sweden se mili haar ne mexico ko or bhi sartak kar diya he
 Also, the team does not have their central defender Hector Moreno in this match
 isliye, brazil ke khilaaf gol khaane se bachane ke liye team ko pratidwandvi team ke atake ko rokna hoga
 This clearly means that Mexico will not have to let Brazilian star player Philippe Coutinho, Neymar reach their goal post under any circumstances
 mexico ke dephence ko todna hi uske liye samaara erina main khele jane vaale pre-quarter final match kii sabase badi chunauti hogi
 Apart from Neymar and Coutinho, he also has players like Thiago Silva and Gabrielle Jesus

 Filmmaker-storyteller Khwaja Ahmed Abbas had a huge pen world
 sattar saal kii zindagi main unhone itani hi kitaaben bhi likhin
 What to say about the article in newspapers and in the Risals
 kehete hai har buudhvaar ko 'blitz' main unka stambh, angreji main 'da last pej' or urdu main 'azaad kalam' sheershak se chhapata tha
 And you would be surprised to know that he wrote it for forty years continuously, in which the subjects of the two tongues were often different
 kehete hai ki duniya main apane dhang kaa yah ek anokhaa record he
 When Rajkamal Prakashan published a compilation of his stories under the name 'mein Kuchh Kehna Hai', it was discussed a lot
 is sankalan kii sabhi 17 kahaniyon ko unki nathin or unke sahitya kii adhyeta zoya zadi ne sangrahit kiya he
 Some of these stories appeared in Hindi for the first time
 
 Zaidi states that Abbas saheb was a person who "has the goal of life, a purpose for which he lives
" ek makasad manushya ke samaaj main badlaav laane kaa, uski soi hui aatma ko jagaane kaa
 He did this for his life in his stories, films and in his columns
 aamajan se hamadardi, maanviyata main atoot vishwaas, stri kii pidaa kii gahari parkhi samaj or bhrasht naukarshahi se ek tikhi kalakaar-sulabh jugupsa, ve tatva hai jo in kahaniyon main dekhne ko milte hai
 Dr
 zadi ke shabdon main, ye kahaniyaan abbaas sahab kii aatma kaa darpan hai
 In these stories you will find Abbas who wanted to see the man as a developed and good person
 is kitaab kaa ek khaas aakarshan khwaja ahamed abbaas kaa ek saakshaatkaar he jise kisi or ne nahin, krishn chander ne liya tha
 He is the same Krishan Chander who wrote in the preface of his story collection 'paon Mein Phool' after his friendship of three years, "when i read the stories of Apne, Ismat and Manto, i think we are a beautiful chariot
 Are riding on jabaki abbaas kii kahaniyon se lagata he jaise wo hawaii jahaaz par ud rahaa ho
 There is a glow in our chariots
 unke pahiyon tak main nakkashi he
 Their seats are fitted with bells
 unke ghodo kii gardanon se chaandi kii ghantiyaan latak rahi hai
 But his gait is very sluggish
 unki sadake gandi hai or unamem bahut gaddhe hai
 While there are no pits in Abbas's writing
 unki sadak pakki or samtal he
 His pen seems to be running on rubber tires
 pashchim main sahitya or patrakarita kii simaaen dhundhlee pad rahi hai
 The sentences are getting shorter
 ham lekhakon main ye kubi sirf abbaas main he
 "today on Abbas's death anniversary, he has a classic story from his compilation 'main Kuchh Kehna Hai': Ababil - Khwaja Ahmad Abbasus had a name Rahim Khan, but hardly anyone like him
 gaanv bhar uske naam se kaanpata tha na aadmi par taras khaae na jaanavar par
 One day the child of Ramu Luhar tied the thorns in his bull's tail and then killed him while killing him
 agle din zaldaar kii ghodi uske khet main ghus ai to lathi lekar itnaa maaraa ki lahooluhaan kar diya
 People used to say that Kambakht is not afraid of God either
 maasoom bacchon or bezabaan jaanwaron tak ko maaf nahin karata
 It will surely burn in the world
 magar ye sab uski peeth ke peeche kaha jaataa tha
 Nobody had the courage to move the tongue in front
 ek din bindu kii jo shamat ai to usne kah diya, "are bhai rahim kaan tu kyon bacchon ko martha he?' bas us garib kii wo durgat banaai ki us din se logon ne baat bhi kerani chhod di ki maaloom nahin kis baat par bighad pade
 The hawk thought that his mind was disturbed
 isko paagalakhaane bhejnaa chahie
 If someone used to kill someone now, then report the report to the police station
 magar kis kii majaal thi ki uske kilaaf gavaahi dekar usase dushmani mol letaa
 The entire village stopped talking to him
 magar us par koi asar na hua
 In the morning, the plow seemed to be moving towards its field
 raste main kisi se na bolta
 Go to the farm and talk to the bulls like men
 usne donon ke naam rakhe hue the
 One used to say Nathu, the other was sprayed
 hal chalaate hue bolta jaataa, "kyun-be natthu tu sidhaa nahin chalata
 This farm will complete your father today
 or abe chhiddu teri bhi shamat ai he kya?" or phir un garibon kii shamat aa hi jaati
 String shot donon belon kii qamar par zakhm pad gaye the
 When he came home in the evening, he would get angry at his wife and children there
 daal yaa saag main namak he, bivi ko udhed daalaa
 a child is doing mischief, hanging him upside down and knocking him unconscious by hitting him with a rope of oxen
 garaz har-rose ek afat bapa rahati thi
 On the night of the huts of the surrounding hut, hearing the sound of Rahim Khan's abuses, his wife and children being beaten and crying, but what could the poor people do, if anyone refused, they would also be killed
 maar khate-khate bivi garib to ad muiho gai thi, chalis baras kii umr main saath saal kii maaloom hoti thi
 The children kept beating when they were small
 bada jab baarah baras kaa hua to ek din maar kha kar jo bhaaga to phir waapas naa lautaa
 There used to be a relationship in the village of near
 usne apane paas rakh liya
 One day the wife said fearfully, "go towards Bilaspur and bring Nuru
 " bas phir kya tha aag bagula ho gaya
 "I go to take that punk
 ab wo khud bhi aayaa to taangen cheer kar phenk doongaa
 "why did that crook come back in the face of death
 do saal ke baad chota ladkaa bindu bhi bhaag gaya or bhai ke paas rahane laga
 Rahim Khan was left with a wife to feel angry, so the poor was so beaten that he had become addicted
 magar ek din usko itnaa maaraa ki us se bhi na rahaa gaya
 And when Rahim Khan went to the field after getting the chance, he called his brother and went with him to his mother
 ham saaya kii aurat se kah gai ki aaen to kah dena ki main chand rose ke liye apni maan ke paas ram nagar ja rahi hoon
 In the evening, Rahim Khan came back with the oxen, then the neighbor said fearfully that his wife had gone to his mother for a few days
 rahim kaan ne kilaaf mamul khaamoshi se baat suni or bail baandhane chalaa gaya
 He was sure that his wife would never come again
 ahaate main bail baandh kar jhonpade ke andar gaya to ek billi miaun miaun kar rahi thi
 If no one else saw it, he caught his tail and threw it out the door
 chuulhe ko ja kar dekha to thanda padaa hua tha
 Who would put bread on fire? Sleeping without having to eat or drink anything
 agle din rahim kaan jab so kar uthaa to din chadh chukaa tha
 But today he was in no hurry to go to the farm
 bakriyon kaa doodh dooh kar piya or huqqa bhar kar palang par baith gaya
 Now there was sunshine in the hut
 ek kone main dekha to jaale lage hue the
 Thought that i should bring cleanliness
 ek baans main kapadaa baandh kar jaale utaar rahaa tha ki khapril main ababilon kaa ek ghonslaa nazar aayaa
 The two men sometimes went inside and sometimes came out
 pehle usne iraadaa kiya ki baans se ghonslaa tod daale
 Don't know what you thought then
 ek ghadonchi laa kar us par chadha or ghonsle main jhaank kar dekha
 Children were chirping with two red herbs inside
 or unke maan baap apni aulad kii hifaazat ke liye uske sar par mandla rahe the
 She had extended her hand towards the nest that the female abbeel attacked her with her beak
 "ari, aankh phodegi?" usne apana kaufanaak qahakahaa maar kar kaha
 And came down from the stove
 ababilon kaa ghonslaa salaamat rahaa
 From the next day he started going to the farm again
 gaanv waalon main se ab bhi koi usase baat na karata tha
 Run plows throughout the day, give water or cut farming
 lekin shaam ko suraj chhipane se kuch pehle hi ghar aa jaataa
 Filled the hook and lay near the bed, watching the nest of the abbeels
 ab donon bachche bhi udne ke qaabil ho gaye the
 He named them both after his children, Nuro and Bindu
 ab duniya main uske dost ye chaar ababil hi rah gaye the
 But he was surprised that no one had seen him killing his bulls for a long time
 natthu or chhiddu kush the
 The marks of wounds from his waist had almost disappeared
 rahim kaan ek din khet se zaraa savere chalaa aa rahaa tha ki chand bachche sadak par kundi khelte hue mili
 He had to see that everyone left his shoes and ran away
 wo kahata hi rahaa, "are main koi martha thodaa hi hoon
 “the sky was cloudy
 jaldi jaldi belon ko haankata hua ghar laayaa
 They had to be tied that the cloud thundered loudly and more rain started
 andar aa kar kivaad band kiye or chiraag jala kar ujaalaa kiya
 hasb-e-mamul sliced the stale bread and put it in a place close to the nest of the abbeels
 "are o bindu
 Hey o nuro ' pukaara magar wo na nikle
 The four who were peeping in the nest were sitting with their heads facing their heads
 ain jis jagah chat main ghonslaa tha vahaan ek suraakh tha or barish kaa pani tapak rahaa tha
 If this water keeps coming in this way for a while, then the nest will be destroyed and the birds will become homeless
 ye soch kar usne kivaad khole or musaladhar barish main seedhi laga kar chat par chadh gaya
 By the time he landed the soil and closed the hole, it was alcoholic
 palang par ja kar baitha to kai chhinken ain
 But he did not care and went to sleep with wet cloth on his bed
 agle din subah ko uthaa to tamaam badan main dard or sakht bukaar tha
 Who asks and who brings medicine
 do din usee haalat main padaa rahaa
 When he did not see him going to the farm for two days, then the villagers felt happy
 kaalu zaldaar or kai kisaan shaam ko uske jhonpade main dekhne aae
 When i looked up, i was talking to you lying on the bed
 "are bindu
 Hey Nooru kahan mar gaye
 Who will give you food today? "A few people were fluttering in the room
 "bechaara pagal ho gaya he
 "kalu Zamindar nodded his head
 "subah ko shipha-kaanaa waalon ko pataa denge ki pagalkhaanaa bhijwa den
 "the next day in the morning when his neighbors brought the Shifakhana and opened the door of his hut, he was dead
 uski paaenti chaar ababilein sar jhukaae khamosh baithi thim

 On the allegations of irregularities in the allocation of land to his family members, he said that a judicial inquiry has already been ordered in this matter

 He ignored the Sunday high command of the BJP high command to call Delhi
 bataaya jaataa he ki yediurppa istipha dene kii alaakaman kii hidaayat par abhi bhi apane pattey kholane se bachane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 He has told the top leadership that the removal of him from the post of chief minister may harm the first government of the BJP on its own in any state of South India

 Former Delhi minister and MLA from Karawal Nagar Kapil Mishra has once again targeted Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 is baar unhone dilli main faile pradooshan or smog ke liye dilli sarkaar ko doshi bataate hue ek gaanaa banaaya he, jise unhone ek puraane gane kii tarj par khud aawaaj di he
 Through the song, Kapil Mishra has accused the Delhi government that from December 2015 to October 2017, the Delhi government made a lot of promises to stop pollution, but the promises could not come out of the papers and come true
 kapil mishra kaa aaropahai ki disambar 2015 main dilli sarkaar ne pehali baar pradooshan kam karne ke liye od ivan yojana kaa elaan kiya tha
 There was also a fine of Rs 2,000 for violation of the rules
 iske baad od ivan part-2 bhi rakhaa gaya
 Kapil Mishra has alleged that in October 2016, the Delhi government had announced to install 5 air purifiers, but it was not implemented even after a year
 kapil mishrane gane ke jariye ek RTI kaa hawala dete hue aarope lagaaya ki beete 2 varshon main dilli sarkaar ko pradooshan shulk ke jariye 787 karod rupee mili, lekin pradooshan ke khatme ke liye sarkaar ne ek rupaya kharch nahin kiya
 In the past, it has not been sung for the first time on Kejriwal, when Kapil Mishra has composed a song on Arvind Kejriwal
 isse pehle bavana vidhansabha upachunaav ke dauraan bhi kapil mishra ne gaanaa banaaya tha or uske jariye kejariwal par aarope lagaae the
 During that time the video was also very viral, but despite the video being viral, the Aam Aadmi Party was not harmed and its candidate won in Bawana
 a post shared by Colors TV (@colorstv) on Nov 27, 2018 at 3:29am PSTA post shared by Viral Bhayani (@viralbhayani) on Nov 30, 2018 at 9:25am PST Calling for breaking the 'speed-breakers' to gain power at the Center, BJP President Nitin Gadkari on Saturday asked the Chief Ministers of all the states ruled by his party to turn the success of 'good governance' into political success 
 gadakari ne party ke tisare ‘mukhyamantri sammelan’ ke adhyakshiya bhaashan main kaha, 'hamaare rajya desh kii pragati main bahut saraahneey yogadan de rahe hai
 The whole country wants to progress in this way
 magar jahaan rajya sarkarein pragati ke path par tezi se aage bad rahi hai, kendra sarkaar pragati ke maarg par speed braker (gatirohak) bani hui he
 'he said,' We must remove this speed breaker while winning the trust of the people to get power at the center
 ’ baithak ke udghaatan satr main jharkhand ke mukhyamantri arjuna munda or goa ke mukhyamantri manohar parikr ko chhodkar bhaajapa shasit sabhi rajyon ke mukhyamantri moujdu the
 Leaders of the party's opposition from non-bjp ruled states were also called to the meeting
 pichley teen saalon se halaat kaa gauge lene ke liye bhaajapa apane shashan vaale rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon kaa sammelan yojit kar rahi he
 The main theme of this time conference was 'economic situation of the country'

 Industrialists, farmers, laborers, youth, students, women, tribals, backward classes are all desperate
 ’ BJP leader Vijay Goel tried to tell in a press conference that he does not aspire to become the Chief Minister and there is no conflict in the BJP on this issue, but Goyal's recent political hurry has only proved that the party is divided whose The Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party will benefit
 isse pehle, bhartiya janata party kii dilli ikai main takaraav kii baat se naaraaz pradesh adhyaksh vijay goyal ne puri tarah se khaarij kar diya he
 Goel said that the party's parliamentary board has to decide the post of CM and whatever decision she takes, she will accept it

 The Delhi BJP president is said to have told the top leaders that any move to project Harsh Vardhan as the chief ministerial candidate would lower the morale of the party workers at the grassroots
 goyal ne kathith rup se yah kehete hue party ke mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar ke liye apni daavedaari rakhi ki unhone pichley aath maheenon main dilli main party ko majboot karne ke liye kathin mehnat kii he

 serial kaa mudda or bhi zyada tab garma gaya jab kahani main lead karactor apane se doguni umr kii ladki ke saath honeymoon par jane kii baat kehane laga he
 Kapil Sharma's show will not stop, this is the reason
 
 
 bal vivaah ko galat dhang se pesh karne ke baad ab is honeymoon sikvence ko darshak bardaasht nahin kar paa rahe hai
 On the other hand, despite the child being in the lead role, the kind of bold dialogues that have been kept in some places, is increasing the anger of the audience
 yahi vajah he ki kuch apisods ke baad ab is sho ke khilaaf campan shuru kii gai he
 a spectator changed
 org par paharedaar piya kii par roak lagane ke liye is campan ko shuru kiya he
 According to a report by Times of India, 75 people have signed it
 behad kii jagah aayega is superstar kaa sho, jaane koun he wo
 
 
 However, serials like Balika Vadhu were earlier shown on TV where a social issue like child marriage was highlighted
 aise main campan shuru karne waalon kaa kahana tha ki paharedaar piya kii main ladkaa bal vivaah kaa shikaar nahin he
 She is portrayed as a romantic hero influencing a woman much older than her

 doshiyon kii manodasha ko dekhte hue tihaad prashasan ne in par nigehabaani kaa paharaa kadaa kar diya
 According to officials, there are two reasons for increased surveillance
 pehla, faansee kii sajaa milane ke baad doshi khudakushi kii koshish na karen
 Second, it should not run away from jail
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki jail number-4 main band cese ke ek doshivinay sharmaane diwaar par apana sir markar khud ko ghayal karne kii koshish kii thi
 After this, it was shifted from jail number-4 to high security ward of jail number-7

 Significantly, Vinay has also tried suicide before

 Model and x Bigg Boss contestant Sophia Hayat has posted a video on her Instagram account saying that she has been sexually abused in Mecca
 sophia ke mutabik, vah apane mangetar ke saath makka gai thim
 Sofia has given the video caption, 'islam teaches women respect
 koi purush apni patni ko chhodkar kisi gaiyr mahila ko chhu nahin saktaa
 That's why i like Islam
 lekin yah niyam makka main lagu nahin hota
 Men forget this rule by going there
 aaj jab main pavitra pathar ko chune kii koshish kar rahi thi, tab mujhe ahsaas hua ki peeche se koi vyakti mere saath ashleel harakat karne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 The line of women was not visible there, as men began to push women using their physical abilities
 jab main pavitra pathar se ek meter dur thi, tab mujhe aise dhakka diya gaya, jisase main saans bhi nahin le paa rahi thi
 i was very scared
 jab maine peeche mudakar dekha to meraa hijaab mere gale main funs gaya
 i was suffocated by the shock of people and i started shouting
 sophia hayaat kii shaadi main aaenge bhagwaan shiv or buddha !sophia ne aage bataaya ki kaise kuch logon ne unki madad kii
 Suddenly some good people came to help me
 main is ghatana se andar tak hill gai hum
 Even at the rate of Allah, people do not remember the things written in the Quran
 allaah mere andar hai or wo mujhase kehete hai ki agar logon ko lagata he ki wo aise hi auraton kii beijjati karte rahenge or sirf pavitra pathar chune se hi janant chale jaaenge, to yah unki galatfahami he
 Islam respects women
 a man must not touch a woman that is not his wife, or be violent to her
 That is why i love islam
 These rules however do not apply in Mecca
 Men forget the rules when they go there
 Today on my 2nd umra as i attempted again to touch the black stone, i was being pushed by men
 One man was pushing his genitals into me from behind
 
 The Women's queue is non existent because men have used their physical strength to push women out of the way
 As i was about a metre from the black stone, i was pushed so hard against my ribs i could not breath
 i was scared, so i decided to turn back, as i did, men kept pushing, and my hijab came off and got caught between the pushing men, i was being dragged back by it and was started to be strangled by it
 i screamed
 Suddenly a few good men saw what was happening and came to my rescue
 i am so shaken up and sad that at the house of God; men do not care about the words in the Quran
 Allah is in me and she says to me that if a man thinks he will go to Jannat by touching the black stone yet disregards the respect Islam has for women, then your hajj or umrah is useless
 In the house of Allah women are being disrespected
 Allah is the greatest she is the most high
 
 
 i am so sad this happens in her house in Makkah
 The man who lifts a women to the stone and does not touch it himself will surely see Jannat
 i appeal to the King to set up 1 day for only women so that they may with deepest respect, be able to touch the Kabba, without this non islamic behaviour from men
 i know women desire as much as men to touch the kabba and stone
 
 
 so why should they have to suffer? a woman cannot match a mans physical strength
 Even in the cave where the prophet pbuh received the Quran, people are throwing rubbish and even urinating around it as their are no toilets
 Again
 
 do you think by touching the walls of the cave your prayers will be answered if you do not look after her home? i was there 2 days and will try again
 
 i saw women trampled on and squashed by men
 
 the basic foundations of Islam 
 
 peace love and respect for each other
 
 have been forgotten in the very place they should be remembered
 Namaste
 
 Salaam

 Mulayam is busy in strengthening Akhilesh - Sharda Shukldarulas Mulayam Singh Yadav did not read the press release given by Shivpal, which had mention of forming a separate party
 isse shivpal khemaa is kadar naaraaz ho gaya he
 Sharada Prasad Shukla, once considered a special leader of Mulayam and now considered close to Shivpal, was so upset with Mulayam's announcement of not forming a new party that he not only called Mulayam Singh Yadav a fake socialist but said that the two fathers and sons met Huh
 mulaayam sirf akhilesh ko majboot karne me jute he
 Sharada Shukla said, Dimple Yadav was forcibly chanted, Mulayam Singh Yadav is cheating with the party workers and the public

 It is ridiculous that we buy expensive diesel in dollars, then collect garbage from house to house, spreading garbage vehicle pollution in every village, town, city, and all that waste is dumped on an open field
 is tarah safai abhiyaan ke naam par videshi mudra kaa apvyay, vaayu pradooshan ko badhaava, jameen kaa durupyog ho rahaa he

 It was being said that the report would be submitted to the cabinet by the end of this week
 lekin sutron kaa kahana he ki samiti abhi bhi report ko antim rup nahin de pai he
 Sources say that even though the talks have been completed, the committee is still taking a long time to prepare the report
 sutara yah bhi bataa rahe hai ki abhi samiti ko alouns ko lekar report taiyaar karne main 4-5 din kaa or samay lagegaa
 That is, it has become clear that now this report has been postponed for a week
 ab agle saptaah yah report taiyaar ho paaegi or phir is maheene ke antim saptaah main is report ke cabinet kii baithak main prastut kiye jane kii ummid he
 When it was talked to the staff leader Shivgopal Mishra in this regard, he said that the employee is very angry due to the delay in this whole matter
 unhone kaha ki vah jald hi cabinet sachiv se is sambandh main mulaakaat karenge or karmchaariyon kii chintaa se ek baar phir unhen avgat karaayenge
 Mishra said that the issue of allowance and especially the issue of HRA also affects more employees
 unhone bataaya ki kaaphi samay se echaare ke vivaad main hone se tisare or chauthe varg ke karmchaariyon ko sarvaadhik dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Mishra said that the central employees of the officer class do not have much problem with the HRA
 adhikari varg ke logon ke paas yaa to apana flats hota he yaa phir vah sarkari makaan le lete hai
 In such a situation, the central class and third class employees are facing a lot of trouble

 It is also believed that this report can be presented in the cabinet meeting to be held next week

 It is noteworthy that the report of the committees should have come in four months but the central staff is angry due to the delay
 isse pehle shiv gopal mishra ne pehle bataaya tha ki teen taarikh ko bhi railmantri se mulaakaat kii gai thi
 In this meeting also, information was given to the Railway Minister and other top officials about the huge anger against the railway employees' allowance, minimum wage and fitment formula, NPS and pension
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) dwaara kendriya karmchaariyon ko die jane vaale kai bhatton ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti he
 The Narendra Modi government had approved the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission in 2016 and implemented the 7th Pay Commission report from 1 January 2016
 lekin, bhatton ke saath kai muddon par asahmati hone kii vajah se in siforishein puri tarah se lagu nahin ho pain
 For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye
 Many employees are sorry for ending many allowances
 kyonki kai alouns abhi tak lagu nahin hue or karmchaariyon ko uskaa sidhaa laabh nahin mila he to karmchaariyon ko lag rahaa he ki vetan ayog kii report abhi lagu nahin hui
 Till now, the government had announced the formation of three committees to resolve the questions raised after the employees' displeasure over the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission
 saatven vetan ayog kii report main alouns ko lekar hue vivaad se judi ek samiti, duusari samiti pension ko lekar or teesri samiti vetanman main kathith visangatiyon ko lekar banaai gai thi
 The most important committee is formed with discrepancies
 is anomali samiti kaa naam diya gaya he
 The same committee also has the issue of minimum pay scale
 chaturth shreniyon ke karmchaariyon ke nunatam vetanman kaa mudda bhi is teesri samiti kaa paas he
 The same committee is talking to employee organizations seeking to raise the minimum pay scale
 vitt sachiv kii adhyakshata main is samiti kaa gathan kiya gaya he
 The committee consists of secretaries from six ministries
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon kii ore karmchaaree sanghathan ne maang kii he ki echaare ko puraane formule ke aadhaar par tay kiya jaae
 The organization has asked the committee of secretaries that the transport allowance be revised according to inflation
 sanghathan ne sarkaar se yah maang kii he ki bacchon kii shiksha ke liye diya jane vaale alouns ko kam se kam 3000 rupee rakhaa jaae
 The organization has also demanded a medical allowance of Rs 2000
 sanghathan ne sarkaar se yah bhi kaha he ki kai alouns jo saatven vetan ayog ne samaapt kiye hai unpar punarvichaar kiya jaae
 It is believed that the government has divided the Transport Allowance (traveling Allowance) into two parts
 ek sisie or doosraa purvavat kii tarah diya jane vaala tie he
 It is believed that this will be payable like the Fifth Pay Commission
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki inako die se alag kar diya jayega or yah fiks slab rate par tay hoga
 The most important question still remains as to how long the government has agreed to give the HRA
 yah prashn abhi bhi karmchaariyon ko sata rahaa he
 Does this rate 1
 1
 16 or 1 is applied
 4
 With effect from 17, it will be applicable
 jahaan tak karmchaariyon kaa sawaal he vah ise pichley saal janvari se lagu karwaane kii maang karte rahe hai or sarkaar kii ore se kuch samay pehle aisa ishaara mila tha ki sabhi vivaadit alouns ko 1 april 2017 se lagu kiya jayega
 For the information, let us tell that the demand of the employees is that the HRA should be decided on the basis of the old formula or the rate should be increased
 kendriya karmchaariyon kaa kahana he ki vartmaan main tay formula ke hisaab se echaare karmchaariyon ko pehle kii tulana main kam milane laga he
 Let me tell you that there is confusion about many allowances given to the Central Employees by the Seventh Pay Commission
 narendra modi sarkaar ne 2016 main saatven vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri di thi or 1 janvari 2016 se 7wein vetan ayog kii report ko lagu kiya tha
 However, due to disagreement on several issues with allowances, these recommendations were not fully implemented
 kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar kii ore se baatcheet ke liye adhikrut adhikari echaare ko 1 str upar karne ko taiyaar hue hai ab echaare 30%, 20% or 10% tak ho saktaa he
 At the same time, reports are being received from reliable sources that 30 percent can be done in big cities, but it is not decided yet
 karmchaaree sanghathan kaa kahana rahaa he ki agar sarkaar ne echaare badhaayaa nahin he to gata kaise sakati hai
 In support of their argument, the staff argues whether the rent of houses in cities has come down
 kya makaan saste ho gaye hai
 When this has not happened how can the government do injustice to its employees
 bataa den ki vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne apni report main echaare ko aarambh main 24%, 16% or 8% tay kiya tha or kaha gaya tha ki jab die 50 pratishat tak pahunch jayega to yah 27%, 18% or 9% kramash: ho jayega
 Not only this, the Pay Commission had also said that when DA becomes 100%, then the rate will be 30%, 20% and 10% for X, y and z cities respectively
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon ke sanyukt sanghathan enzesie ne gathit vetan ayog ke samaksh apni maang se sambandhit gyaapan main is dar ko kramash: 60%, 40% or 20% karne ke liye kaha tha
 The organization alleges that the commission completely rejected the employees' demand
 unka kahana he ki vetan ayog ne is rate ko chathe vetan ayog se bhi kam kar diya he
 They say that because it is combined with DA, it will increase only when the DA rate increases by a fixed percentage
 tippaniyan For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances

 Explain that there have been many complaints of employees from the report of the Seventh Pay Commission and in such a situation the Narendra Modi government of the Center has set up committees under the concerned Ministry and Ministry of Finance to address the grievances of its employees
 ye samitiyaan karmchaaree netaaon se baat kar rahi hai or is samitiyon ko apana faisla chaar maheene main sarkaar ko dena tha lekin abhi tak keval alouns samiti kii hi antim baithak hui he

 Explain that there have been many complaints of employees from the report of the Seventh Pay Commission and in such a situation the Narendra Modi government of the Center has set up committees under the concerned Ministry and Ministry of Finance to address the grievances of its employees
 ye samitiyaan karmchaaree netaaon se baat kar rahi hai or is samitiyon ko apana faisla chaar maheene main sarkaar ko dena tha lekin abhi tak keval alouns samiti kii hi antim baithak hui he
 Explain that in view of the displeasure of the employees on issues ranging from minimum wage to various allowances, the government made a committee and tried to solve it
 teen samitiyon main ek samiti alouns ko lekar banaai gai thi
 The committee, chaired by Finance Secretary Ashok Lavasa, has so far held about 15 meetings and on the 6th, the last round of talks between the staff representative and the government representatives on this committee also ended
 mana yah bhi ja rahaa he ki agle saptaah hone vaali cabinet kii baithak main yah report prastut ho sakati he
 After the decision in this meeting can come any good news for the central employees
 ullekhneey he ki samitiyon kii report chaar maheenon main aa jaani chahie thi lekin deree ke kaaran kendriya karmchaaree naaraaz hai
 Earlier, Shiv Gopal Mishra had earlier told that he had met the Railway Minister on three dates
 is baithak main bhi railway karmchaariyon kii alouns, minimum veg or fitment formula, enpies or pension ko lekar baari rosh ke bare main railmantri sahit anya bade adhikariyon ko jaankaree di gai thi
 Let me tell you that there is confusion about many allowances given to the Central Employees by the 7th Pay Commission
 narendra modi sarkaar ne 2016 main saatven vetan ayog (seventh Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri di thi or 1 janvari 2016 se 7wein vetan ayog kii report ko lagu kiya tha
 However, due to disagreement on several issues with allowances, these recommendations were not fully implemented
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki saatvaan vetan ayog se pehle kendriya karmchaaree (central employees) 196 kism ke alounces ke hakdaar the
 But the Seventh Pay Commission abolished or merged many allowances, leaving only 55 allowances left
 tamaam karmchaariyon ko kai alouns samaapt hone kaa malaal he
 Because many allowances have not been implemented yet and the employees have not received their direct benefits, the employees feel that the Pay Commission report is not yet implemented
 ab tak 7wein vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko lekar karmchaariyon kii naaraazgi ke baad uthe sawaalon ke samaadhaan ke liye sarkaar kii ore se teen samitiyon ke gathan kaa elaan kiya gaya tha
 In the report of the Seventh Pay Commission, a committee was formed on the dispute regarding allowance, the second committee was on the issue of pension and the third committee was made about the alleged discrepancies in the pay scale
 sabase ahm samiti visangatiyon ko lekar banaai gai he
 This anomaly committee has been named

 This third committee also has the issue of minimum pay scale of the fourth category employees
 yahi samiti nunatam vetanman ko badhaane kii maang karne vaale karmchaaree sanghathanon se baat kar rahi he
 This committee has been formed under the chairmanship of the Finance Secretary
 samiti main chah mantralayon ke sachiv shaamil hai
 It is noteworthy that the employees' organization has demanded that the HRA should be decided on the basis of the old formula
 sanghathan ne sachivon kii samiti se kaha he ki transport alouns ko mahangaai ke hisaab se reshnalise kiya jaye
 The organization has demanded from the government that the allowance given for the education of children should be kept at least Rs 3000
 sanghathan ne medical alouns kii rakam bhi 2000 rupee karne kii maang kii he
 The organization has also asked the government to revisit several allowances which the Seventh Pay Commission has abolished
 mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar ne transport alouns (yatra bhatta) ko do bhaagon main baanta he
 One is the CCA and the other is the TA given as undone
 yah paanchaven vetan ayog kii bhaanti dey hoga, aisa mana ja rahaa he
 It is also being said that they will be separated from DA and this fix will be fixed at slab rate
 sabase ahm sawaal ab bhi bana hua he ki sarkaar ne echaare ko kab se dene kii baat ko sweekaar kiya he
 This question is still haunting the employees

 As far as the employees are concerned, they have been demanding to implement it since January last year and some time ago there was a hint from the government that all the disputed allowances will be implemented from 1 April 2017

 Central employees say that currently HRA employees are getting less than earlier as per the fixed formula

 It is being said that the officials authorized to negotiate on behalf of the government have agreed to raise the HRA to 1 level, now the HRA can be up to 30%, 20% and 10%

 The employees' organization has said that if the government has not increased the HRA, how can it be reduced

 Have houses become cheap? jab yah nahin hua he to sarkaar apane karmchaariyon ke saath anyaay kaise kar sakati he

 These committees are talking to the staff leaders and these committees had to give their decision to the government in four months, but so far only the final committee meeting has been held
 isse pehle shiv gopal mishra ne pehle bataaya tha ki teen taarikh ko bhi railmantri se mulaakaat kii gai thi
 In this meeting also, information was given to the Railway Minister and other top officials about the huge anger against the railway employees' allowance, minimum wage and fitment formula, NPS and pension
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) dwaara kendriya karmchaariyon ko die jane vaale kai bhatton ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti he
 The Narendra Modi government had approved the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission in 2016 and implemented the 7th Pay Commission report from 1 January 2016
 lekin, bhatton ke saath kai muddon par asahmati hone kii vajah se in siforishein puri tarah se lagu nahin ho pain
 For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye
 Many employees are sorry for ending many allowances
 kyonki kai alouns abhi tak lagu nahin hue or karmchaariyon ko uskaa sidhaa laabh nahin mila he to karmchaariyon ko lag rahaa he ki vetan ayog kii report abhi lagu nahin hui
 Till now, the government had announced the formation of three committees to resolve the questions raised after the employees' displeasure over the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission
 saatven vetan ayog kii report main alouns ko lekar hue vivaad se judi ek samiti, duusari samiti pension ko lekar or teesri samiti vetanman main kathith visangatiyon ko lekar banaai gai thi
 The most important committee is formed with discrepancies
 is anomali samiti kaa naam diya gaya he
 The same committee also has the issue of minimum pay scale
 chaturth shreniyon ke karmchaariyon ke nunatam vetanman kaa mudda bhi is teesri samiti kaa paas he
 The same committee is talking to employee organizations seeking to raise the minimum pay scale
 vitt sachiv kii adhyakshata main is samiti kaa gathan kiya gaya he
 The committee consists of secretaries from six ministries
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon kii ore karmchaaree sanghathan ne maang kii he ki echaare ko puraane formule ke aadhaar par tay kiya jaae
 The organization has asked the committee of secretaries that the transport allowance be revised according to inflation
 sanghathan ne sarkaar se yah maang kii he ki bacchon kii shiksha ke liye diya jane vaale alouns ko kam se kam 3000 rupee rakhaa jaae
 The organization has also demanded a medical allowance of Rs 2000
 sanghathan ne sarkaar se yah bhi kaha he ki kai alouns jo saatven vetan ayog ne samaapt kiye hai unpar punarvichaar kiya jaae
 It is believed that the government has divided the Transport Allowance (traveling Allowance) into two parts
 ek sisie or doosraa purvavat kii tarah diya jane vaala tie he
 It is believed that this will be payable like the Fifth Pay Commission
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki inako die se alag kar diya jayega or yah fiks slab rate par tay hoga
 The most important question still remains as to how long the government has agreed to give the HRA
 yah prashn abhi bhi karmchaariyon ko sata rahaa he
 Does this rate 1
 1
 16 or 1 is applied
 4
 With effect from 17, it will be applicable
 jahaan tak karmchaariyon kaa sawaal he vah ise pichley saal janvari se lagu karwaane kii maang karte rahe hai or sarkaar kii ore se kuch samay pehle aisa ishaara mila tha ki sabhi vivaadit alouns ko 1 april 2017 se lagu kiya jayega
 For the information, let us tell that the demand of the employees is that the HRA should be decided on the basis of the old formula or the rate should be increased
 kendriya karmchaariyon kaa kahana he ki vartmaan main tay formula ke hisaab se echaare karmchaariyon ko pehle kii tulana main kam milane laga he
 Let me tell you that there is confusion about many allowances given to the Central Employees by the Seventh Pay Commission
 narendra modi sarkaar ne 2016 main saatven vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri di thi or 1 janvari 2016 se 7wein vetan ayog kii report ko lagu kiya tha
 However, due to disagreement on several issues with allowances, these recommendations were not fully implemented
 kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar kii ore se baatcheet ke liye adhikrut adhikari echaare ko 1 str upar karne ko taiyaar hue hai ab echaare 30%, 20% or 10% tak ho saktaa he
 At the same time, reports are being received from reliable sources that 30 percent can be done in big cities, but it is not decided yet
 karmchaaree sanghathan kaa kahana rahaa he ki agar sarkaar ne echaare badhaayaa nahin he to gata kaise sakati hai
 In support of their argument, the staff argues whether the rent of houses in cities has come down
 kya makaan saste ho gaye hai
 When this has not happened how can the government do injustice to its employees
 bataa den ki vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne apni report main echaare ko aarambh main 24%, 16% or 8% tay kiya tha or kaha gaya tha ki jab die 50 pratishat tak pahunch jayega to yah 27%, 18% or 9% kramash: ho jayega
 Not only this, the Pay Commission had also said that when DA becomes 100%, then the rate will be 30%, 20% and 10% for X, y and z cities respectively
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon ke sanyukt sanghathan enzesie ne gathit vetan ayog ke samaksh apni maang se sambandhit gyaapan main is dar ko kramash: 60%, 40% or 20% karne ke liye kaha tha
 The organization alleges that the commission completely rejected the employees' demand
 unka kahana he ki vetan ayog ne is rate ko chathe vetan ayog se bhi kam kar diya he
 They say that because it is combined with DA, it will increase only when the DA rate increases by a fixed percentage
 tippaniyan For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye

 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon ke sanyukt sanghathan enzesie ne gathit vetan ayog ke samaksh apni maang se sambandhit gyaapan main is dar ko kramash: 60%, 40% or 20% karne ke liye kaha tha
 The organization alleges that the commission completely rejected the employees' demand
 unka kahana he ki vetan ayog ne is rate ko chathe vetan ayog se bhi kam kar diya he
 They say that because it is combined with DA, it will increase only when the DA rate increases by a fixed percentage
 tippaniyan For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye
 Many employees are sorry for ending many allowances
 kyonki kai alouns abhi tak lagu nahin hue or karmchaariyon ko uskaa sidhaa laabh nahin mila he to karmchaariyon ko lag rahaa he ki vetan ayog kii report abhi lagu nahin hui
 Explain that there have been many complaints of employees from the report of the Seventh Pay Commission and in such a situation the Narendra Modi government of the Center has set up committees under the concerned Ministry and Ministry of Finance to address the grievances of its employees
 ye samitiyaan karmchaaree netaaon se baat kar rahi hai or is samitiyon ko apana faisla chaar maheene main sarkaar ko dena tha lekin abhi tak keval alouns samiti kii hi antim baithak hui he
 Let me tell you that there is confusion about many allowances given to the Central Employees by the Seventh Pay Commission
 narendra modi sarkaar ne 2016 main saatven vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri di thi or 1 janvari 2016 se 7wein vetan ayog kii report ko lagu kiya tha
 However, due to disagreement on several issues with allowances, these recommendations were not fully implemented
 kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar kii ore se baatcheet ke liye adhikrut adhikari echaare ko 1 str upar karne ko taiyaar hue hai ab echaare 30%, 20% or 10% tak ho saktaa he
 At the same time, reports are being received from reliable sources that 30 percent can be done in big cities, but it is not decided yet
 karmchaaree sanghathan kaa kahana rahaa he ki agar sarkaar ne echaare badhaayaa nahin he to gata kaise sakati hai
 In support of their argument, the staff argues whether the rent of houses in cities has come down
 kya makaan saste ho gaye hai
 When this has not happened how can the government do injustice to its employees
 bataa den ki vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne apni report main echaare ko aarambh main 24%, 16% or 8% tay kiya tha or kaha gaya tha ki jab die 50 pratishat tak pahunch jayega to yah 27%, 18% or 9% kramash: ho jayega

 It is being said that the officials authorized to negotiate on behalf of the government have agreed to raise the HRA to 1 level, now the HRA can be up to 30%, 20% and 10%
 vahiin, vishwasaneey sutron ke hawaale se khabar mil rahi he ki bade shaharon main ise 30 pratishat kiya ja saktaa he, lekin yah abhi tay nahin he
 The employees' organization has said that if the government has not increased the HRA, how can it be reduced
 apane tark ke samarthan main karmchaariyon kii daleel he ki kya shaharon main makaan kaa kiraaya kam hua he
 Have houses become cheap? jab yah nahin hua he to sarkaar apane karmchaariyon ke saath anyaay kaise kar sakati he
 Explain that the Pay Commission in its report had initially fixed the HRA as 24%, 16% and 8% and stated that when the DA reaches 50 percent it will be 27%, 18% and 9%
 Will be respectively
 itnaa hi nahin vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne yah bhi kaha tha ki jab die 100% ho jayega tab yah dar 30%, 20% or 10% kramash : eks, vaai or jed shaharon ke liye ho jaaegi
 It is noteworthy that in the memorandum related to their demand before the pay commission constituted by the joint organization of employees, NJCA asked for this rate to be 60%, 40% and 20% respectively
 sanghathan kaa aarope he ki ayog ne karmchaariyon kii maang ko puri tarah se thukraa diya tha
 He says that the Pay Commission has reduced this rate from the Sixth Pay Commission
 inkaa kahana he ki kyonki ise die ke saath joda gaya he to yah tabhi badhegaa jab die kii dar tay pratishat tak bad jaaegi
 The comments jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki saatvaan vetan ayog se pehle kendriya karmchaaree 196 kism ke alounces ke hakdaar the
 But the Seventh Pay Commission abolished or merged many allowances, leaving only 55 allowances left
 tamaam karmchaariyon ko kai alouns samaapt hone kaa malaal he
 Because many allowances have not been implemented yet and the employees have not received their direct benefits, the employees feel that the Pay Commission report is not yet implemented
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog kii report se karmchaariyon kii kai shikaayatein rahi hai or aise main centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne apane karmchaariyon kii shikayaton ko dur karne ke liye sambandhit mantralay or vittamantralay ke adheen samitiyon kaa gathan kiya he
 These committees are talking to the staff leaders and these committees had to give their decision to the government in four months, but so far only the final committee meeting has been held

 The judge asked the AG to inform tomorrow whether there was any mechanism other than Parliament to deal with the grant of pension to mps
 sunwaayee buudhvaar ko jari rahegi
 The Supreme Court is hearing a public interest litigation filed for the salaries and allowances of mps
 yachika main saansadon ke vetan or bhatte ko lekar ek swatantra ayog banane kii maang kii gai he
 In the last hearing, the court had asked the central government what happened to the independent mechanisms that have been in operation for 12 years? The court had asked the Center to clarify its stand by March 5
 vahiin centre sarkaar ne kaha ki swatantra maikenism abhi vichaar main he
 The comments isse pehle purv saansadon ko aaajeevan pension or alouns die jane ke maamle main supreme court ne centre sarkaar, chunaav ayog, loksabhaa or rajyasabha ke mahasachiv ko notice jari kiya tha
 An NGO named Lokprahari has filed a petition asking how mps themselves decide salary and allowances
 iske liye koi sthai ayog hona chahie
 At the same time, former mps and mlas are being given lifetime pension, while this is not included in the rules
 yachikakarta ne supreme court main kaha ki agar ek din ke liye bhi koi saansad ban jaataa he to vah na keval aaajeevan pension kaa hakdaar ho jaataa he, uski patni ko bhi pension milti he
 At the same time, he is entitled to travel free in the train with a companion for life, whereas the Governor of the state is also not given a lifetime pension
 yahaan tak ki supreme court or hoicourt ke vartmaan jajon ko bhi saathi ke liye muft yatra kaa laabh nahin diya jaataa
 Even if he is going on an official visit
 aise main yah vyavastha aam logon ke liye boj he or yah vyavastha raajnneeti ko or bhi lubhaavna bana detii he
 If seen in reality, this expenditure is incurred on people who do not represent the public, therefore this system should be scrapped
 saasandon ke vetan or bhatte ko lekar daakhil janhit yachika par supreme court sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 The petition calls for an independent commission on the salary and allowances of mps
 pichhali sunwaayee main court ne centre sarkaar se poocha tha ki 12 saal se jo swatantra maikenism bana rahe hai, uskaa kya hua? court ne paanch march tak centre ko apana rukh spasht karne ko kaha tha
 At the same time, the central government said that independent mechanism is still under consideration
 tippaniyan Earlier, the Supreme Court had issued a notice to the General Secretary of the Central Government, Election Commission, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha in the matter of giving life pension and allowance to former mps
 lokprahari naamak NGO ne yachika daakhil kar kaha he ki saansad kaise khud hi vetan or bhatta tay karte hai
 There should be a permanent commission for this
 vahiin purv saasandon or vidhayakon ko aaajeevan pension di ja rahi he jabaki niyamon main yah shaamil nahin he
 The petitioner stated in the Supreme Court that if a person becomes an MP even for a day, he not only gets a lifetime pension, his wife also gets a pension
 saath hi vah jivan bhar ek saathi ke saath train main free yatra karne kaa hakdaar ho jaataa he jabaki rajya ke garvanar ko bhi aaajeevan pension nahin di jaati
 Even the current judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court are not given the benefit of free travel for companionship
 chaahe vah aadhikarik yatra par hi kyon naa ja rahe hon
 In such a situation, this system is a burden for the common people and this system makes politics even more attractive
 agar asal main dekha jaae to yah kharch aise logon par kiya jaataa he jo janata kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karte, isliye is vyavastha ko khatm kiya janaa chahie

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke baad ajtak-exis maai india ke agsit pole (exit Poll) survey main bijepi kii aguwai vaali endie bahumat hasil karti hui dikh rahi he
 According to the survey, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seems to be performing well in those states where it had lost the assembly elections a few months ago
 isamen rajasthan bhi shaamil he or yahaan congress kii sthiti loksabhaa main phir se acchhee nahin dikh rahi he
 In the exit poll survey of Aaj tak-axis My India after the elections, once again the magic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seen in Rajasthan and Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot may have to face a crushing defeat
 agsit pole ke mutabik rajasthan kii kul 25 siton main se bijepi ko kareeb 23 se 25 siten to congress ko 0 se 3 siten milti dikh rahi he
 It will not be surprising if the BJP wins all 25 seats in the upcoming election results on 23 May
 isse pehle 2014 ke chunaav main bhi bijepi ne rajasthan samet kai rajyon main clin sweep kiya tha
 If the same result as the survey comes then it will be a big blow for Chief Minister Gehlot
 bete vaibhav gahalot kii seat bhi fancisrve ke anusaar, khud mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ke bete vaibhav gahalot kii jodhpur seat bhi fansi hui najar aa rahi he
 The survey shows Gehlot's son defeating him on this seat
 vahiin rajya kii 25 siton main sirf 3 siton par hi congress bijepi ko chunauti detii dikh rahi he

 Farmers are not even getting the price of orange for five rupees per kg
 jo aam taur par 25-30 rupee kilo hota he jabaki bade shaharon me yaheen 70-100 kilo baithta he
 The buyers are not buying the farmers' gardens and the orange is fully ripe
 agar ek saptaah main santara nahin bika to puri fasal jameen par girakar barbaad ho jaaegi
 Orange farming started in the area 30 years ago, whose plant was brought from Nagpur Maharashtra
 is kshetra kii mitti or paryaavaran santara kheti ke liye upyukt he jisaki vajah se iskaa utpaadan itnaa adhik hota he
 So far, the government has not taken such a step so that the orange farmers can benefit
 yah lagaataar teesraa saal he jisame santara kisaan baari nuksaan uthaa rahe hai
 In 2015, farmers had to throw orange on the road, then the price could not get even fifty paisa a kilo

 It is a crop that comes twice a year

 Farmers' gardens were not sold, which is now directly visible
 30 saal pehle ilaake main santara kheti kii shruwaat hui jiskaa paudha nagpur maharashtra se laayaa gaya tha
 The soil and environment of this region is suitable for orange cultivation, due to which its production is so high
 abhi tak sarkaar ne aisa kii qadam nahi uthaaya jisase santara kisaanon ko phayda mil sake
 This is the third consecutive year in which orange farmers are suffering heavy losses
 saal 2015 main kisaanon ko santara sadak par fankna padaa tha tab bhav pachaas paise kilo bhi nahi mil paaya tha
 The crop was destroyed in 2016 by hailstorm and this year the price is back on the ground

 Seeing the flowering of the orange orchards, the merchant buys the advance cash, but this time due to demonetization in November, the advance deals were not done

 If you think that the concept of vegetarianism is only in humans then you are absolutely wrong, because a recent study has shown that some insectivorous plants are also adopting vegetarianism
 utricularia prajati ke bladervarts paudhe kitbhakshi paudhon kii prajati he, jo chote-chote kiton kaa aahaar karte hai
 However, new studies have shown that these plants are now consuming algae and paras for balanced nutrition

 Once trapped, the insects die of suffocation, after which the plant digests them as enzymes

 According to researchers Marianne Köller Perutka and Wolframe Adelsnig of the University of Vienna, Austria, 'plants of the Bladvert species are leaning towards diets like algae and pollen
 ' According to this paper published in the latest issue of the research paper 'annals of Botany', in areas where algae are found in abundance, while pests are lacking, vegetarian plants were found to be larger in size than insectivorous plants

 While Ayodhya is looking forward to the construction of the Ramlala temple, Lord Rama is locked in lock for the last 21 years in his maternal grandmother, 30 km from Raipur
 darasal do pariwaron ke bich aadhipaty ko lekar chal rahi ladaai ke kaaran yahaan bhagwaan ram ke mandir main taala laga hua he
 Chandkhuri, a village with a population of about four thousand near Arang, the capital of South Kosala, is considered the birthplace of Kaushalya, the eldest queen of King Dasharatha of Ayodhya
 ek samay 126 talab vaale is gaanv main jalsen naamak jalashay ke madhya tapu main kaushalya mata kaa mandir he, jahaan kaushalya kii god main bhagwaan ram virajman hai
 This is the only temple of Kaushalya Mata in the world
 mata kaushalya kaa maayka hone ke kaaran is gaanv ko bhagwaan ram kaa nanihaal mana jaataa he
 There is a temple of Lord Rama in the middle of the village which has been closed for the last 21 years
 isaki vajah yahaan do pariwaron ke bich mandir ke malikana haq ko lekar chal rahaa vivaad he
 According to Indu Sharma, the head of the Sharma family and sarpanch of the village, who lived in the house built in the courtyard of the temple, the temple was built hundreds of years ago
 jab seetaram swami naidu chandkhuri gaanv ke malgujaar the tab unhone varsh 1952 main ayurvedic doctor ke rup main yahaan aae narsingh prasad upaadhyaay ko mandir kii seva main niyukt kiya or mandir kii lagbhag 28 acre jameen kii jimmedaari saunpi
 Naidu died shortly thereafter
 indu sharma ne bataaya ki jab may varsh 1997 main unke shvasur tathaa mandir ke pujari narsingh prasad upaadhyaay kii mrityu hui tab agast main yahaan ke pratishthit bas parivaar ne is mandir or jameen par daawa kiya or mandir main kathith rup se taala laga diya
 Since then this temple has been closed
 unhone bataaya ki tab se lekar ab tak is mandir ke haq ke liye donon pariwaron ke madhya ladaai chal rahi he
 Sarpanch Indu Sharma wants the temple door to be opened so that the people of the village can visit
 idhar mandir ko lekar bas parivaar kaa alag daawa he
 Mahesh Bais of the Bais family says that when the Naidu family owned property in the village, the Bais family had bought their entire land
 jiske saath hi yah mandir bhi bas parivaar ke hisse main aa gaya
 The temple is almost three hundred years old and was renovated by Malguzar Naidu in the year 1915
 bas parivaar ke sadsy shyaam bas kehete hai ki unke parivaar ke paas mandir aane ke baad bhi pujari upaadhyaay kaa parivaar is mandir main puja archana karata tha
 But after the death of the priest, worship in the temple ceased
 mandir bhi rakh rakhaav ke abhaav main jeernsheern ho gaya or kisi anhoni se bachane ke liye mandir ko band karnaa padaa
 The land of the temple is named after Lord Rama
 bas kehete hai ki unke parivaar ne mandir kaa nayaa nakshaa bana liya he tathaa jald hi jirnoddhar kaa kaary shuru kiya jayega jisase mandir phir se khul sake
 State's archaeologist Dr
 Hemu Yadu says that looking at the dome of the temple, it seems that the temple was built in the middle of the 17th to 18th century
 is mandir kaa nirmaan gaanv main bane kaushalya mata ke mandir ke baad hua he
 From the architectural point of view of the temple of Kaushalya Mata, the time of its construction can be considered as the sixth century
 tippaniyan Yadu states that Chhattisgarh is called Dakshin Kosala and was the kingdom of Bhanumantha, the king of Dakshin Kosala in the Ramayana period
 jinaki putree bhaanumati (kaushalya) thi
 The capital of South Kosala was Arang Nagari and Chandkuri was earlier named Chandrapuri where Mata Kaushalya was born
 puratatvvid kehete hai ki chunki chhattisgarh shriram kaa nanihaal he isliye ram chhattisgarh vaasiyon ke bhaanje hue
 This is the reason that the residents here see the image of Lord Rama in their nephew, and it is customary to touch the nephew's feet
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Due to the maternal uncle of Mata Kaushalya, this village is considered to be a child of Lord Rama
 gaanv ke madhya main bhagwaan ram kaa mandir he jo pichley 21 varshon se band he
 The reason for this is the ongoing dispute between two families over the ownership of the temple
 mandir ke praangan main bane ghar main nivas karne vaale sharma parivaar kii mukhiya or gaanv kii sarpanch indu sharma ke mutabik mandir kaa nirmaan saikadon varsh purv karaayaa gaya tha
 When Sitaram Swami Naidu was Malguzar of Chandkuri village, he appointed Narasimh Prasad Upadhyay, who came here as Ayurvedic doctor in the year 1952, in the service of the temple and entrusted the responsibility of about 28 acres of the land of the temple
 iske kuch samay baad naidu kii mrityu ho gai
 Indu Sharma said that when his brother-in-law and temple priest Narasimh Prasad Upadhyay died in May 1997, the iconic Bais family claimed the temple and land in August and allegedly locked the temple
 tab se yah mandir band he
 He told that since then till now the fight for the right of this temple is going on between the two families
 sarpanch indu sharma chaahati hai ki mandir kaa dwaar khol diya jaae jisase gaanv ke log darshan kar saken
 The Bais family has a different claim about the temple here
 bas parivaar ke mahesh bas kehete hai ki gaanv main jab naidu parivaar kii malgujari thi tab bas parivaar ne unki puri jameen kharidi lee thi
 With which this temple also came under the Bais family
 mandir lagbhag teen sau saal purana he tathaa malgujaar naidu ne is mandir kaa jirnoddhar varsh 1915 main karaayaa tha
 Shyam Bais, a member of the Bais family, says that even after his family came to the temple, the priest Upadhyay's family used to worship at this temple
 lekin pujari kii mrityu ke baad mandir main puja band ho gai
 The temple also got dilapidated due to lack of maintenance and the temple had to be closed to avoid any untoward incident
 mandir kii jameen bhagwaan ram ke naam par he
 Bais says that his family has made a new map of the temple and renovation work will be started soon so that the temple can reopen
 rajya ke puratatvvid doctor hemu yadu kehete hai ki mandir ke gumbad ko dekhte hue lagata he ki mandir kaa nirmaan 17 veen se 18 veen shatabdi ke madhya main karaayaa gaya tha
 This temple is built after the temple of Kaushalya Mata built in the village
 kaushalya mata ke mandir kii sthapaty kala kii drushti se iske nirmaan kaa samay chhathvin shatabdi mana ja saktaa he
 The comments yadu kehete hai ki chhattisgarh ko dakshin kosal kaha jaataa he or ramayana kaal main dakshin kosal ke raja bhaanumant kaa rajya tha
 Whose daughter was Bhanumati (kaushalya)
 dakshin kosal kii rajdhani aarang nagari thi tathaa chandkhuri kaa naam pehle chandrapuri tha jahaan mata kaushalya kaa janm hua tha
 Archaeologists say that since Chhattisgarh is a nephew of Shri Ram, Ram is a nephew of the people of Chhattisgarh
 yahi kaaran he ki yahaan ke nivasee apane bhaanje main bhagwaan ram kii chhavi dekhte hai, tathaa yahaan bhaanje kaa pair chune kaa rivaaj he
 (this news has not been edited by the NDTV team
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) indu sharma ne bataaya ki jab may varsh 1997 main unke shvasur tathaa mandir ke pujari narsingh prasad upaadhyaay kii mrityu hui tab agast main yahaan ke pratishthit bas parivaar ne is mandir or jameen par daawa kiya or mandir main kathith rup se taala laga diya
 Since then this temple has been closed
 unhone bataaya ki tab se lekar ab tak is mandir ke haq ke liye donon pariwaron ke madhya ladaai chal rahi he
 Sarpanch Indu Sharma wants the temple door to be opened so that the people of the village can visit
