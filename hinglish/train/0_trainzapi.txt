 The passage of the Citizenship (amendment) Bill in Parliament will surely win the views of Mohammad Ali Jinnah over the views of Mahatma Gandhi
 yah baat ravivaar ko congress ke varisht netaa shashi tharur ne kahi
 Tharoor said that by granting citizenship on the basis of religion, India would remain a "hindutva version of Pakistan"
 purv kendriya mantri ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki bijepi sarkaar 'ek samudaay' ko nishaanaa bana rahi he or duusare dharmon kii tulana main us samudaay ke logon kii unheen sthitiyon main utpeedan par unhen sharan nahin de rahi he
 Tharoor said in an interview to the news agency that even if the bill is passed by both houses of parliament, he is confident that no bench of the Supreme Court will allow it to be a "gross violation" of the basic spirit of the Constitution of India
 tharur ne kaha, "yah sarkaar kaa sharmnaak kaam he jisane pichley saal rashtriya sharnaarthi niti banane par charchaa karne se inkaar kar diya, jise maine nijee sadsy vidheyak ke taur par prastaavit kiya tha or tatkaaleen grih mantri, grih rajyamantri or grih sachiv ke saath nijee taur par saajha kiya tha
 "they allege that suddenly they have gone ahead to give citizenship to the refugees, while in fact they do not even want to take the basic steps necessary to improve refugee status under international law or to ensure good behavior from refugees
 is
 tharur ne kaha, "isse spasht hota he ki yah mahaj kutil raajnneetik chaal he taaki bharat main ek samudaay ko nishaanaa banaaya ja sake
 With this we will be left with the Hindutva version of Pakistan
 "vidheyak par congress ke ruukh ke bare main poochne par tharur ne kaha, "haalanki, main party kaa aadhikarik pravaktaa nahin hum, lekin mujhe vishwaas he ki congress main ham sab maanate hai ki naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak na keval samvidhan ke anuchhed 14 or 15 ke tahat praapt samanta or dharmik aadhaar par bhedbhaav nahin karne kii mul bhaavana ke khilaaf he balki bharat kii avdhaaran par bhi hamalaa he
 "he said that India's freedom struggle was divided on the basis of whether nationality should be decided on the basis of religion and those who believed in that principle advocated the concept of Pakistan
 tharur ne kaha, "mahatma gandhi, (jawahar laal) nehru, moulana (abul kalam) aaazaad, doctor ambedkar kaa iske ulat vishwaas tha ki dharm kaa rashtriyata se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 He conceptualized India and he created an independent country for people of all religions, regions, castes and languages
 " unhone aarope lagaae ki samvidhan main bharat kaa yah mul vichaar jhalkata he jisase bijepi chhalaava karnaa chaahati he
 Asked about the rationale that citizenship cannot be the basis of religion, Tharoor said that BJP has cleared the way for the founding of Pakistan's founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah in relation to the nation in India where religion is embedded in nationality
 And by doing so, he disputed that concept of India of Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel, Azad, Ambedkar and freedom fighters of his time
 Areas are, was, for which he fought
 unhone kaha ki vidheyak hinduon ke aitihaasik viraasat ke khilaaf he jis par ve garv karte hai
 Tharoor said, "swami Vivekananda said at the Chicago Religion Conference in 1893 that he was proud to talk about a country where people of every country and religion find refuge after suffering persecution

 The government is preparing to launch India's largest life insurance company 'life Insurance Corporation of India' (LIC) in the stock market or listing on the exchanges
 sarkaar is vitt varsh main apane vinievesh kaarykram ko tej karne or baari rakam jutaney ke liye aisi taiyaari kar rahi he
 If LIC was listed on the stock exchanges, it could easily become the country's number one listed company by market value and would overtake the current giant Reliance Industries
 asal main elisi kaa puunjigat aadhaar sirf 5 karod rupee kaa he, lekin iskaa vitt varsh 2017-18 main munafa yaa valuation sarplus 48,436 karod rupee kaa tha or asset under management 31
 11 lakh crore
 isaki vajah se elisi kaa ipo kaaphi premium par listed hoga
 The Indian Express quoted sources as saying that the process is still at an early stage and it has been discussed among the higher officials of the government
 prastaav yah he ki sarkaar niyantrit is sanstha kaa pehle ipo laakar thodaa hissaa bechaa jaae or baad main sarkaar kii hissedari bechi jaae
 Significantly, the government has announced in the budget that public holding in listed companies will have to be at least 35 percent
 iske pehle sarkaar do saal pehle general insurance corporation or new india esurance kaa ipo laakar share bazaar main soochibaddh kar chuki he
 When a company is listed on the stock market for the first time, an initial public offer or IPO is issued for it
 elisi ko share bazaar main laane ke liye sabase pehle elisi act main badlaav karnaa hoga
 It is worth noting that till now the government has been reluctant to launch LIC in the stock market, probably because LIC has played an important role in bringing out government companies in the stock market
 asal main jab kisi sarkari company ke sheyaron main bikwaali kii vajah se zyada giravat aati he, yaa kharidaar kam rahete hai to aksar yah dekha gaya ki elisi in companiyon ke share kharid leti he, jisase unhen sahaara mil jaataa he
 LIC has millions of crores of cash which it invests in many instruments
 elisi ne dibenture or bond main kareeb 4,34,959 karod rupee or kai buniyadi dhaancha pariyojnaon main 3,76,097 karod rupee kaa nivesh kar rakhaa he
 In the year 2018-19, LIC has earned a profit of Rs 23,621 crore by investing in the stock market
 company ne is dauraan share bazaar main 68,621 karod rupee kaa nivesh kiya tha
 LIC is currently under the Regulation of Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), although it is governed under the LIC Act of 1956
 isaki share bazaar main listing se pehle sarkaar ko is act main badlaav karnaa hoga

 bihar main loksabhaa chunaav (lok Sabha Election) se pehle endie (NDA) main buudhvaar ko thodi uthal-puthal dekhne ko mili
 JDU has announced its new candidate from Sitamarhi and has replaced Sunil Pintu (sunil Kumar Pintu) as its candidate in place of Dr Varun Kumar
 darasal namakan se pehle hi sitamarhi se janata dal united (JDU) ke ummidavaar doctor varun kumaar ne apana tikat lautaa diya or chunaav nahin ladane kaa elaan kiya
 After this, there was a ruckus within JDU
 aanan-fanan main bijepi netaa sunil kumaar pintu ko bijepi se jadyu main shaamil kiya gaya or phir unhen sitamarhi seat se tikat diya gaya
 After Dr Varun Kumar returned the ticket, Nitish Kumar's party Janata Dal United (JDU) made Sunil Kumar Pintu, a former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA and a minister in the Bihar government, a candidate for the Lok Sabha elections from Sitamarhi
 isaki jaankaree buudhvaar ko patna main press conference kar jad netaa rajeev ranjan urf lalan singh ne di
 The special thing is that during the press conference itself, Sunil Kumar Pintu was first given membership of JDU and his candidature was announced
 bataa den ki buudhvaar ko subah khabar ai ki varun ne nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) se milakar chunaav ladane main asamarthta jataai he
 According to reports, neither Janata Dal United nor any BJP leader was giving much importance to them
 ve isliye kaaphi pareshaan the
 So he returned the ticket before nomination
 bataa den, sitamarhi main 6 may ko matdaan hai
 In Bihar, Nitish Kumar's JDU, BJP and Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party are contesting the Lok Sabha elections
 bhaajapa or jadyu 17-17 or lojpa chah siton par chunaav lard rahi he
 JDU has made Sunil Kumar Pintu its candidate from Sitamarhi seat, his stature is very big in politics
 sunil kumaar 4 baar vidhayak rah chuke hai or nitish sarkaar main mantri bhi
 He has been a stalwart of the BJP
 vah isse pehle tak bijepi ke tikat par hi vidhansabha chunaav jitate aa rahe hai
 There is no concrete proposal about the Uniform Civil Code, what is it, what will it be like, no one knows, there are sixteen questions of the Law Commission
 kya teen talaak yaa bahuvivaah ko samaapt kar dena hi unifarm civil code aa jayega
 Does the Uniform Civil Code also mean that the customs of other societies will also be debated
 kya is vakt jo hindu code bill he wo gender justise kii kasautiyon par khara utarataa he yaa usamen bhi kisi prakaar ke sanshodhan kii baat hogi yaa ho rahi he
 Will the Hindu Code Bill be the Uniform Civil Code or will the Code of customs of different religions be made under a Uniform Civil Code
 kaash koi draft hota to baat hoti
 However, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley posted on Facebook that the issue of constitutional validity of triple talaq is different from the Uniform Civil Code
 samvidhan nirmaataaon ne ummid jataai thi ki niti nirdeshak siddhanton ke tahat rajya uniform civil lau banane kii koshish karegaa
 On several occasions, the Supreme Court has sought opinion on this from the government
 sarkaar ne baar-baar adaalaton or sansad se kaha he ki personal lau main amuman koi bhi badlaav sabhi pakshon ke saath vichaar vimarsh ke baad hi hote rahe hai
 The Law Commission has resumed the academic process on the issue of the Uniform Civil Code
 uniform civil code aaj sambhav he yaa nahin, ise rahane den to bhi ye sawaal uthta hi he ki vibhinn samudaayon ke personal lau main sudhaar kii zarurat he
 Even if there is no uniformity, improvement in personal law is a continuous process
 samay ke saath kai praavdhaan puraane or bekaar ho jate hai
 Governments, legislatures and communities have to respond to the demands of time
 vitt mantri jetali ke is jawaab ko kai tareeke se padhaa ja saktaa he
 Are they saying that the process of reforming the personal law of many communities is under discussion? to kya muslim personal lau ke alaava bhi anya personal lau ko lekar sudhaar par bahes hone ja rahi he
 His scholarship in the matter of law is well known, if he too looks at some questions of the Law Commission, then a person like him would hardly like
 phir bhi vitt mantri kehete hai ki lau kamishan ne academik vimarsh kii shuruyaat kii he
 Look at the Law Commission's questions yourself and decide if their questions give a glimpse of what the Finance Minister is talking about
 kya sirf muslim personal lau main sudhaar kii zarurat he yaa anya personal lau main bhi
 The Law Commission has only two questions that deal with other communities
 jetali ne fasebuk par aage yah bhi likhaa he ki dharmik vyavhaar, reeti rivaaj or naagarik adhikaar main buniyadi antar hote hai
 Religious rites related to birth, adoption, inheritance, marriage and death are also performed through customs
 kya janm, god lene yaa viraasat yaa shaadi, talaak aadi ko lekar jo adhikaar kii baat hoti he unki guarantee dharm se honi chahie yaa samvidhan se
 Can there be equality in these matters, there can be a compromise with human dignity
 kuch log kah sakate hai ki personal lau ko samvidhan ke anusaar nahin hona chahie
 The opinion of the government is clear
 personal lau ko samvidhan ke anusaar hi hona chahie
 Three divorces will be weighed on the basis of living with equality and respect
 yahi paimaana anya duusare personal lau par bhi lagu hoga
 If Finance Minister Jaitley had also made it clear in his Facebook post what other personal laws are there where he wants to implement the criteria for testing triple talaq
 unhone zarur anya persolan lau main sudhaar kii baat kii he lekin udhaaharan sirf teen talaak kaa hi diya he
 It would have been better if they had given examples of other communities as well
 unke is post ko dhyaan se dekha janaa chahie ki ve teen talaak kii samaapti kii baat kar rahe hai yaa uniform civil code kii vakaalat kar rahe hai
 Jaitley has written
 thodi mehnat to kerani padegi
 Finally, this line also needs to be understood carefully
 uniform civil code ke sambandh main academik bahes lau kamishan ke samaksh chalati rah sakati he
 The answer to this question is to be discovered that if every community has a separate personal law, should not all these personal laws be constitutional
 hamane shuukravaar ko nalsar uniwarsity of lau, hyderabad ke vaais chancelar faizan mustafaa sahab se sawaal jawaab ke andaaz main is par baat kii thi
 Some questions were left
 is bich nivedita menon ne hindu main ek lekh likhaa he is par
 Some questions also arise from Nivedita Menon's article
 jaise unhone kaha he ki kya hindu code bill main gender justise he? kya vahi model he yaa isamen bhi sudhaar hoga? kya sabhi personal lau kii gender justise prathaon kaa ek jagah sankalan kiya jayega? kya usisi ke tahat hindu andivided family ke praavdhaan ko samaapt karnaa hoga? kya bharat ke sabhi naagarik ek samaan uttaradhikaar kanoon se shasit honge? Finance Minister Jaitley and Nivedita have repeatedly used the term Gender Justice
 matlab yahi hua ki kanoon aisa ho ki auraton ko barabari kaa haq mili
 Secondly, there is a need to understand the need to abolish the provision of Hindu joint family and bring laws for equal succession
 nivedita ke lekh se ek or sawaal ubharta he ki gender justise ke anusaar shaadi kii behatar vyavastha kya ho
 The amount of mehr is fixed for Muslim women in Nikah
 nivedita menon ne poocha he ki aisa system hinduon main nahin he to kya uniform civil lau ke tahat ye anya samudaayon main bhi lagu hoga
 The Finance Minister says go and argue before the Law Commission, but the questions put by the Law Commission on the website are very basic and do not provide a comprehensive form of this debate
 ye meri apni raay he
 In all the articles, you will hear about the uniform civil code of Goa
 ham iske bare main bhi alag se charchaa karnaa chaahate hai
 Nivedita Menon has written in the Hindu newspaper that the Portuguese Civil Procedure Code (1939) of Goa came into force in 1939 in Goa
 yah na to uniform yani samaan he, naa hi isse gender justise hota he
 The legal provisions of marriage are different for different religious communities
 nivedita menon ke anusaar goa main hinduon ke reeti rivaaj or chalan ko manyata di gai he
 In which Hindus are allowed polygamy in a limited way
 tippaniyan Is that really so goa kaa civil code sabhi samudaayon kii patniyon ko sabhi prakaar kii sampattiyon main pachaas fisadi kii hissedari sunishchit karata he
 Whether it is in practice or not is not known
 bharat sarkaar ne bhi aise kanoon banaae hai
 The daughters, wives and friends on Twitter, Facebook, will also spread awareness if they post whether something has been found in their father's property
 muslim mahilaon ko aise adhikaar hindu mahilaon se pehle se hasil hai
 Just post whether they get anything in practice or not
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Does the Hindu Code bill presently meet the criteria of the Gender Justice or will there be any amendment in it or is happening
 kya hindu code bill hi uniform civil code hoga yaa ek uniform civil code ke tahat alag alag dharmon ke reeti rivaajon kaa code banegaa
 i wish there was a draft
 baharhaal vitt mantri arun jetali ne fasebuk par post kiya he ki teen talaaq kii sanvaidhanik vaidhata kaa jo mudda he wo uniform civil code se alag he
 The constitution makers had hoped that under the Directive Principles of Policy, the state would try to enact a uniform civil law
 kai maukon par supreme court ne sarkaar se is par raay maangi he
 The government has repeatedly told the courts and parliament that any changes in personal law have been made only after consultation with all parties
 uniform civil code ke mudde par lau kamishan ne academik prakriya phir se shuru kii he
 Whether or not the Uniform Civil Code is possible today, even if it remains, the question arises that there is a need to improve the personal law of different communities 
 ekarupata na bhi ho to bhi personal lau main sudhaar ek satat prakriya he
 Many provisions become outdated and useless over time
 sarkaron, vidhayikaon or samudaayon ko samay kii maang kaa jawaab dena padataa he
 Finance Minister Jaitley's answer can be read in many ways
 kya ve yah kah rahe hai ki kai samudaayon ke personal lau main sudhaar kii prakriya par vimarsh chal rahaa he
 So, apart from Muslim personal law, there is going to be a debate on reforms other than personal law
 kanoon ke maamle main unki vidwata jagaprasiddh he, agar ve bhi lau kamishan ke kuch sawaalon ko dekhenge to unke jaisaa vyakti shaayad hi pasand kare
 Yet the Finance Minister says that the Law Commission has initiated academic discussions
 lau kamishan ke sawaalon ko aap khud dekhiye or tay kiijie ki kya unke sawaalon se wo jhalak milti he jisaki baat vitt mantri kar rahe hai
 Is there a need to reform Muslim personal law only or in other personal law also
 lau kamishan main ek do hi sawaal hai jo duusare samudaayon kii baat karte hai
 Jaitley further wrote on Facebook that there are fundamental differences in religious behavior, customs and civil rights
 janm, god lene, viraasat, shaadi or mrityu se sambandhit dharmik sanskaron ko reeti rivaajon ke zariye bhi puraa kiya jaataa he
 Whether the right to talk about birth, adoption or inheritance or marriage, divorce etc
 should be guaranteed by religion or by constitution
 kya in maamalon main gair barabari ho sakati he, maanav sammaan se koi samjhauta ho saktaa he
 Some may say that personal law should not be in accordance with the constitution
 sarkaar kaa mat saaf he
 Personal law should be in accordance with the constitution
 teen talaak ko barabari or sammaan ke saath jeene ke aadhaar ke taraazoo par taula jayega
 The same scale will also apply to other personal laws
 agar vitt mantri jetali apane fasebuk post main yah bhi spasht kar dete ki anya personal lau kya hai jahaan ve teen talaak ko parakhane ke paimaanon ko lagu karnaa chaahate hai
 He has definitely talked about reforms in other personal laws but has given examples of only three divorces
 agar ve duusare samudaayon ke bhi udhaaharan dete to behatar hota
 This post of his should be carefully observed whether he is talking about termination of triple talaq or advocating for uniform civil code
 jetali kaa likhaa he
 Will have to do some hard work
 aakhir main unki is pankti ko bhi gaur se samajhane kii zarurat he
 Academic debate regarding the Uniform Civil Code can continue before the Law Commission
 jawaab is sawaal kaa khoja janaa he ki agar har samudaay kaa alag personal lau ho to kya ye sabhi personal lau samvidhan sammat nahin hone chahie
 We spoke to Vice Chancellor Faizan Mustafa Saheb of Nalsar University of Law, Hyderabad on Friday in response to this question
 kuch sawaal or rah gaye the
 Meanwhile, Nivedita Menon has written an article in Hindu on this
 nivedita menon ke lekh se bhi kuch sawaal banate hai
 Like they said, is there a gender justice in the Hindu Code bill? Is that the same model or will it also improve? Will all personal law's gender justice practices be compiled in one place? Will the provision of Hindu Undivided Family be abolished under the UCC? Will all citizens of India be governed by the Uniform Succession Act? vitt mantri jetali or nivedita ne baar baar gender justise shabd kaa istamaal kiya he
 This means that the law should be such that women get the right to equality
 duusari baat he hindu sanyukt parivaar ke praavdhaan ko samaapt kar ek samaan uttaradhikaar ke kanoon laane kii baat ko bhi alag se samajhane kii zarurat he
 Another question emerges from Nivedita's article that what should be the better arrangement for marriage according to Gender Justice
 nikaah main muslim auraton ke liye meher kii rakam tay hoti he
 Nivedita Menon has asked that if such a system does not exist in Hindus, will it be applicable to other communities under Uniform Civil Law as well
 vitt mantri kehete hai lau kamishan ke saamne jaakar bahes karen lekin lau kamishan ne jo sawaal website par rakhe ve behad buniyadi hai or is bahes kaa vyapak rup pradaan nahin karte hai
 This is my opinion
 tamaam lekhon main aap goa ke uniform civil code kaa zikr sunenge
 We also want to discuss this separately
 hindu akhbaar main nivedita menon ne likhaa he ki goa main 1939 main Portuguese Civil Procedure Code (1939) of Goa lagu hua tha
 It is neither uniform, nor does it lead to gender justice
 alag-alag dharmik samudaayon ke liye shaadi ke kanoonee praavdhaan alag hai
 According to Nivedita Menon, the customs and practice of Hindus have been recognized in Goa
 jisamen simit tareeke se hinduon ko bahuvivaah kii anumati bhi he
 The comments kya vaaki aisa he
 The Civil Code of Goa ensures wives of all communities a fifty percent share in all types of properties
 vyavhaar main hota he yaa nahin maaloom nahin
 The Government of India has also made such laws
 jo betiyaan, patniyaan or saheliyaan twitor-fasebuk par hai, agar vahiin post karen ki unke pita kii sampatti main kuch mila he yaa nahin to jaagarukta bhi failegi
 Muslim women already have such rights from Hindu women
 zaraa ve bhi post karen ki vyavhaar main unhen kuch miltaa bhi he yaa nahin
 (this news has not been edited by the NDTV team
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) sarkaar ne baar-baar adaalaton or sansad se kaha he ki personal lau main amuman koi bhi badlaav sabhi pakshon ke saath vichaar vimarsh ke baad hi hote rahe hai
 The Law Commission has resumed the academic process on the issue of the Uniform Civil Code
 uniform civil code aaj sambhav he yaa nahin, ise rahane den to bhi ye sawaal uthta hi he ki vibhinn samudaayon ke personal lau main sudhaar kii zarurat he
 Even if there is no uniformity, improvement in personal law is a continuous process
 samay ke saath kai praavdhaan puraane or bekaar ho jate hai
 Governments, legislatures and communities have to respond to the demands of time
 vitt mantri jetali ke is jawaab ko kai tareeke se padhaa ja saktaa he
 Are they saying that the process of reforming the personal law of many communities is under discussion? to kya muslim personal lau ke alaava bhi anya personal lau ko lekar sudhaar par bahes hone ja rahi he
 His scholarship in the matter of law is well known, if he too looks at some questions of the Law Commission, then a person like him would hardly like
 phir bhi vitt mantri kehete hai ki lau kamishan ne academik vimarsh kii shuruyaat kii he
 Look at the Law Commission's questions yourself and decide if their questions give a glimpse of what the Finance Minister is talking about
 kya sirf muslim personal lau main sudhaar kii zarurat he yaa anya personal lau main bhi
 The Law Commission has only two questions that deal with other communities
 jetali ne fasebuk par aage yah bhi likhaa he ki dharmik vyavhaar, reeti rivaaj or naagarik adhikaar main buniyadi antar hote hai
 Religious rites related to birth, adoption, inheritance, marriage and death are also performed through customs
 kya janm, god lene yaa viraasat yaa shaadi, talaak aadi ko lekar jo adhikaar kii baat hoti he unki guarantee dharm se honi chahie yaa samvidhan se
 Can there be equality in these matters, there can be a compromise with human dignity
 kuch log kah sakate hai ki personal lau ko samvidhan ke anusaar nahin hona chahie
 The opinion of the government is clear
 personal lau ko samvidhan ke anusaar hi hona chahie
 Three divorces will be weighed on the basis of living with equality and respect
 yahi paimaana anya duusare personal lau par bhi lagu hoga
 If Finance Minister Jaitley had also made it clear in his Facebook post what other personal laws are there where he wants to implement the criteria for testing triple talaq
 unhone zarur anya persolan lau main sudhaar kii baat kii he lekin udhaaharan sirf teen talaak kaa hi diya he
 It would have been better if they had given examples of other communities as well
 unke is post ko dhyaan se dekha janaa chahie ki ve teen talaak kii samaapti kii baat kar rahe hai yaa uniform civil code kii vakaalat kar rahe hai
 Jaitley has written
 thodi mehnat to kerani padegi
 Finally, this line also needs to be understood carefully
 uniform civil code ke sambandh main academik bahes lau kamishan ke samaksh chalati rah sakati he
 The answer to this question is to be discovered that if every community has a separate personal law, should not all these personal laws be constitutional

 ) We spoke to Vice Chancellor Faizan Mustafa Saheb of Nalsar University of Law, Hyderabad on Friday in response to this question
 kuch sawaal or rah gaye the
 Meanwhile, Nivedita Menon has written an article in Hindu on this
 nivedita menon ke lekh se bhi kuch sawaal banate hai
 Like they said, is there a gender justice in the Hindu Code bill? Is that the same model or will it also improve? Will all personal law's gender justice practices be compiled in one place? Will the provision of Hindu Undivided Family be abolished under the UCC? Will all citizens of India be governed by the Uniform Succession Act? vitt mantri jetali or nivedita ne baar baar gender justise shabd kaa istamaal kiya he
 This means that the law should be such that women get the right to equality
 duusari baat he hindu sanyukt parivaar ke praavdhaan ko samaapt kar ek samaan uttaradhikaar ke kanoon laane kii baat ko bhi alag se samajhane kii zarurat he
 Another question emerges from Nivedita's article that what should be the better arrangement for marriage according to Gender Justice
 nikaah main muslim auraton ke liye meher kii rakam tay hoti he
 Nivedita Menon has asked that if such a system does not exist in Hindus, will it be applicable to other communities under Uniform Civil Law as well
 vitt mantri kehete hai lau kamishan ke saamne jaakar bahes karen lekin lau kamishan ne jo sawaal website par rakhe ve behad buniyadi hai or is bahes kaa vyapak rup pradaan nahin karte hai
 This is my opinion
 tamaam lekhon main aap goa ke uniform civil code kaa zikr sunenge
 We also want to discuss this separately
 hindu akhbaar main nivedita menon ne likhaa he ki goa main 1939 main Portuguese Civil Procedure Code (1939) of Goa lagu hua tha
 It is neither uniform, nor does it lead to gender justice
 alag-alag dharmik samudaayon ke liye shaadi ke kanoonee praavdhaan alag hai
 According to Nivedita Menon, the customs and practice of Hindus have been recognized in Goa
 jisamen simit tareeke se hinduon ko bahuvivaah kii anumati bhi he
 The comments kya vaaki aisa he
 The Civil Code of Goa ensures wives of all communities a fifty percent share in all types of properties
 vyavhaar main hota he yaa nahin maaloom nahin
 The Government of India has also made such laws
 jo betiyaan, patniyaan or saheliyaan twitor-fasebuk par hai, agar vahiin post karen ki unke pita kii sampatti main kuch mila he yaa nahin to jaagarukta bhi failegi
 Muslim women already have such rights from Hindu women

 ) aam chunaav 2014 main pradhanmantri pad kii daavedaari ke saath gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ne desh se 60 maheenon kaa samay maanga tha
 Modi had said that after becoming the Prime Minister (principal Servant) in the last 60 years, the work which the Congress ruler could not do, he will complete that work in his tenure of 60 months
 narendra modi ne yah daawa dilli ke ramlila maidan se 19 janvari 2014 ko kiya tha
 During this claim, all the veteran leaders of BJP were present on the platform on Ramlila Maidan
 yah daawa karte hue pehali baar narendra modi ne nae bharat kii paribhaasha dete hue kaha tha ki vah ek aise bharat kaa nirmaan karnaa chaahate hai jahaan sirf or sirf sachai kii jeet ho, ahimsa pramukh dharm ho, sabhi dharmon ke saath barabari kaa vyavhaar ho or mahilaon kaa sammaan ho
 Speaking on regional politics, Modi had said that regional aspirations will be taken care of along with strengthening the federal structure of the country to form a BJP government at the center
 ise bhi padhein: kaam nahin aayega chini pataakhe-ladiyon kaa 'rashtravaadi' bahishkaarchunaav ke nattejey modi ke paksh main baithe or vah purna bahumat ke saath abtak ke sabase taqatvar pradhanmantri niyukt hue
 In the 60 months of his tenure, 40 months have passed
 vaadon ke mutabik 60 saal ke congress shaashan kii khaamiyon ko dur karne ke liye unke paas mahaj 20 mahine bache hai
 Know the graph of achievements of Prime Minister Modi in these 40 months: 1
 kisaan or kheti pehali praathamikta: khatm karenge mahangaai kaa kaarobaaranrendra modi ne kaha tha ki kendra main 60 saal kii congress sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan desh main kisaan or kheti kaa jayja lene ke liye koi vyavastha nahin kii gai he
 Due to this, the government does not even know how much crop will be produced during the farming season
 iske chalate salbhar desh main fasalon demand-supplai bigadi rahati thi or desh par hameshaa manhagaai kaa saaya mandaraata rahata tha
 Therefore, during 60 months, the BJP government will create a system to know every single figure related to farmers and farming on real time basis
 is kadam se desh main puure saal kisi bhi utpaada kii kami nahin hone di jaaegi
 Importation will be taken in time to supply the scarce food items when needed
 iskaa sidhaa phayda kisaan ko pahonchega or aam aadmi mahangaai kii maar se bache rahenge

 blike marketing par lagaam ke liye special court or kisaanon ke liye naishanal marketsrendra modi ne daawa kiya tha ki vah apane 60 maheenon ke kaarykaal ke dauraan desh ke sabhi kisaanon ke liye rashtriya ster par agriculture market kaa gathan karenge
 This step will facilitate the farmers of the country to sell their produce directly in the market as well as sell the product at the market rate
 is market ko safal banane ke liye vah blakemarketing karne waalon par lagaam kasne ke liye special court sthapit karenge or jald se jald munafkhoron ko sajaa dene kaa kaam kiya jayega
 Modi had said that this step should have been taken by the Congress government, but the government of Bilawali had to postpone it for 60 years because this move would completely eliminate black marketing from the country and inflation would never bother the common man

 Skill development center will create employment for all Narendra Modi has accused the former Congress governments that no system has been made to provide employment to the youth in the country
 lihaaja apane kaarykaal ke dauraan par desh main skill deveopment centre kaa nirmaan karenge jiskaa kaam arthvyavastha main aavashyaktaa ke anusaar yuvaaon ko taiyaar kiya jayega or unhen rojgaar diya jayega
 Modi said that no preparation has been made for any human resource in the country
 satta main aane ke baad unki sarkaar yah khaakaa taiyaar karegi jisase desh ke yuvaaon ko unki jarurat or kaabiliyat ke aadhaar par naukari di ja sakegi
 The Congress has been postponing this step and with this step the country can become one of the powerful countries of the world
 4
 It will be done for the poor by bringing back black money in foreign countries
narendra Modi had claimed that he will take a big step against black money being accumulated abroad for 60 years, following the ideals of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani
 is kaledhan ko videsh se waapas laayaa jayega or iske liye jaruri kanoon taiyaar kiya jayega
 Modi said that the money will be spent for the benefit of the poor by bringing it back
 ise bhi padhein: sust bazaar, gaayab kharidaar, vinievesh main kaise safal hogi modi sarkaar?5
 The ravaged rail network will be modern, the bullet train will run
 Narendra Modi claimed that the previous Congress government did not try to make Indian Railways modern with changing times
 lihaaja apane kaarykaal ke dauraan vah deshbhar main iaiti kii tarj par railway university kaa gathan karte hue manpower taiyaar karenge jisase bharat kii rail ko duniya kii aadhuniktam rail main badla ja sake
 With this, Nodi had said that he will equip the country with a bullet train on the lines of Japan and China and this bullet train will start running by 2022
 is uplabdhi ke baad puri duniya kaa bharat ke prati najariya badal jayega
 At the same time, the speed of development in the country will increase manifold as soon as modernizing Indian Railways

 Urbanization has become the biggest problem during the 100-year tenure of 100 Smart Cities and Twin Cities Congress
 jabaki vaishvikaran ke is daur main bade or viksit shahar kii arthvyavastha kii dhamniyaan hai
 Therefore, after the formation of the BJP government, he will build 10 smart cities in the country
 ye shahar smart isliye honge ki yahaan log paidal chalakar offis or factory ja saken, swasth suvidhaayen sabhi ke liye ek str kii hon, khelkud ke antarrashtriya str ke sansaadhan sabhi shaharon kii pahunch main ho
 Along with this, the government will try to develop a twin city where both the old cities can be connected with modern facilities by connecting the old smart cities

 In all the states, IIT and AIIMS Modi said that at present, the country's health facilities are in disarray
 purv main sarkaron ne mahaj rajdhani or chune hue shaharon ko swasth suvidha ke kendra me rakhaa
 Due to this, the health facility in the country became very expensive and out of reach of common man
 vahi haal desh main ucch shiksha or takniki shiksha ke chhetra main dekhne ko mili he
 Therefore, after the formation of the BJP government, he will build iits and AIIMS in all the states of the country so that the common man gets excellent service and the youth do not have to leave their state for higher technical education

 haalanki, 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main harish ravat ko bada jhatka laga tha, jab wo uttarakhand kii do siton par chunaav ladane ke baavjood vidhansabha nahin pahunch paae the
 This is the reason why Harish Rawat has now contested from nainital-uddham Singh Nagar Lok Sabha seat, where he faces Ajay Bhatt of Bharatiya Janata Party
 haalanki, dilachasp baat ye he ki harish ravat kii tarah hi ajay bhatta bhi vidhansabha chunaav main apni ranikhet seat nahin bachaa paae the, jabaki puure rajya main bijepi kii lahar chali thi or party sarkaar banane main kaamyaab rahi thi
 Now that he is taking charge of the state BJP president, the party leadership has fielded him for the Lok Sabha battle in front of Harish Rawat, which seems to be a big challenge for him
 nainital kaa jatigat samikarnaisaki vajah nainital loksabhaa seat kaa jatigat sameekaran he
 Harish Rawat being a big leader and the Kshatriya community from which he belongs, is the largest section of Nainital Lok Sabha constituency in terms of voter numbers
 is loksabhaa kshetra main kareeb 18 lakh voter hai, inamen kareeb 18 fisadi kshatriya, kareeb 15 fisadi brahman, 19 fisadi anusuchit jati va janajati, muslim va anya alpsankhyak samet kareeb 32 fisadi or 16 fisadi anya jatiyon se taalluk rakhane vaale matadaata hai
 BJP candidate from Nainital seat Ajay Bhatt Ajay Bhatt comes from Brahmin society
 saath hi wo apane grihnagar ranikhet seat se chunaav haar gaye the
 Ajay Bhatt's lack of personal communication with the public is also considered his weakness
 jabaki duusari taraf bahujan samaaj party kaa pratyaashee bhi pareshaani kaa sabab ban saktaa he
 The BSP has also fielded a Brahmin face in the form of Rajesh Dubey
 basapa supremeo mayawati rudrapur main raily kar apane pratyaashee ke liye samarthan bhi maang chuki hai
 He raised the issue of reservation keeping in mind the depressed class here
 dalit-brahman kaa ye gathjod bhi ajay bhatta ke liye nakaaratmak sabit ho saktaa he
 In the 2014 elections, BSP candidate Laik Ahmed received 59 thousand votes
 haalanki, ajay bhatta ke samarthan main piem narendra modi se lekar mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat va tamaam duusare bade netaa raily kar chuke hai, jabaki harish ravat akele hi bina sheersh netritv ke janata ke bich ja rahe hai, jo ajay bhatta ke paksh main mana janaa rahaa he
 In spite of all this, the history of Nainital seat and Harish Rawat's stature is seen as the strength of Harish Rawat rather than Ajay Bhatt
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan congress pratyaashee harish rawatagram panchayat se raajnneeti kaa aagaajahrish ravat ne almoda ke apane gaanv se apni raajnneeti kaa aagaaj kiya tha
 Harish Rawat took charge as District President of Youth Congress in 1973, taking charge of Block Head and Village Head and thus joined the Congress from early life
 saal 1980 se harish ravat congress kii rashtriya kaaryakarini ke sadsy hai or philhal wo sanghathan main mahasachiv hai
 Rawat's electoral politics is also very old
 uttarakhand jab upi kaa hissaa tha, 1980 main unhone pehali baar almoda-pithauragarh loksabhaa seat se congress ke tikat par loksabhaa chunaav jeeta
 Harish Rawat has been reaching Parliament from Almora and Haridwar, after this Harish Rawat became MP from this seat in 1984 and 1989 also
 2002 se 2008 tak rajyasabha saansad rahane ke baad 2009 main wo phir loksabhaa chunaav jite
 Although Rawat won this election from Haridwar seat, his wife Renuka Rawat lost this seat in 2014
 haalanki, 2016 main harish ravat ko vijay bahuguna kii jagah uttarakhand kaa mukhyamantri banaaya gaya, lekin 2017 main harish ravat bhi haridwar seat se vidhansabha chunaav haar gaye
 During the election campaign, Congress candidate Harish Rawat has now turned to Nainital in the Lok Sabha elections, where the BJP has won thrice (1991, 1998 and 2014) since independence
 1957 main nainital seat par hue pehle chunaav se lekar ab tak 6 baar hi congress ke alaava koi party jeet pai he
 After four consecutive victories since 1999, the Congress was shocked in 2014 by former Chief Minister Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who secured 6,36,769 votes to Karan Chand Singh Baba (3,52,052) of the Congress by more than three lakh votes
 Was defeated
 lekin party ne is baar unka tikat katkar ajay bhatta ko mauka diya he, jinka muqabla purv mukhyamantri or congressi diggaj harish ravat se he or is seat par pehle charan ke tahat 11 april ko matdaan hona he

 Karunanidhi breathed his last on Tuesday
 3 june 1924 ko tamilnadu ke ek nimnavargeey parivaar main janm lene vaale is karishmai netaa ne behad kam umr main raajnneetik jivan kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Influenced by the ideology of EV Ramasamy Periyar, Karunanidhi is considered a craftsman of modern Tamil Nadu
 raajnneetik jivan main unhone kai aise kaam kiye jo kisi bhi netaa ke liye misaal se kam nahin he
 However, the leader who ruled the hearts of the people of Tamil Nadu for many decades, also remained a critic of the people of North India for decades
 aisa hindi ko lekar unke hath or virodh kii vajah se rahaa
 If you look closely, the rise of Karunanidhi in politics and reaching the summit was due to the politics that flourished in the name of protest against language
 karunanidhi ke chashme kaa raaj, 40 din kii talash ke baad germany se aayaa thakarunanidhi kaa janm 3 june 1924 ko tamilnadu ke ek nimnavargeey parivaar main hua
 When Karunanidhi was growing up, Periyar's politics against inequality, ethnic discrimination and religious hypocrisy in Tamil society was getting stronger
 tamilnadu main periyar ne ek saamaajik-raajnneetik andolan khadaa kar diya tha
 This movement was against the ritualistic and religious hypocrisy of Brahminism
 1937 main gaiyr hindi bhashi rajyon main hindi ke anivaary shikshan lagu karne kii yojana thi
 However, it was strongly opposed in non-hindi areas
 khaskar dakshin ke rajya apane ashiyane main kisi duusari bhashaa ko prashray dene kii baat pachaa nahin paa rahe the
 Tamil Nadu was at the forefront among them
 karunanidhi ko collywood kii shradhanjali, filmon kii shooting raddtamilnadu main hindi shikshan ko tamil par kisi duusari bhashaa ko thopane kii tarah liya gaya
 It was also linked to Tamil identity
 us vakt periyar ne iskaa taarkik virodh kiya
 Then many young followers of Periyar also came out on the streets against Hindi
 inamen se karunanidhi bhi ek the
 He was leading the youth in Kallakkudi
 iske liye unhone yuvaaon kaa ek sanghathan bhi khadaa kiya
 Some even consider it the first student organization of Dravidian politics
 us vakt unki umr mahaj 14 saal thi
 Karunanidhi was also arrested for violence during the movement
 is andolan ke baad karunanidhi ne kabhi peeche mudakar nahin dekha
 He used the principles of Dravidian politics fiercely in the writing of film screenplays and plays
 karunanidhi logon ke dilon main raaj karne lage
 Later he also reached the assembly
 nidhan tak apane jeevankaal main karunanidhi ne koi chunaav nahin haara
 After independence, the demand for making Hindi the national language of India started gaining momentum
 60 ke dashak main iske khilaaf or samarthan main deshvyapee andolan khadaa hua
 In non-hindi speaking states, especially Tamil Nadu, the protest movement against Hindi had become very widespread and violent
 or virodh karne waalon main sabase aage karunanidhi or unka parivaar tha
 He was isolated at times and faced widespread criticism, but he never compromised on Hindi
 antim dinon tak karunanidhi hindi kaa virodh karte rahe
 Whenever i got a chance, he was openly against Hindi
 raajnneetik vyaktitv ke is pahalu kii vajah se hindi bhashi rajyon main kabhi bhi logon ne karunanidhi ko unke puure swaroop ke saath sweekaar nahin kiya
 As much as he was anti-hindi, despite being in the top line of national politics, the Hindi belt also opposed him
 ek tarah se karunanidhi ke vyaktitv kaa yah virodhabhash dilachasp he

 On the other hand, Ranbir is rehearsing in Juhu
 film ke diarector anuraag kaa kahana he ki donon profeshnals hai or unke bich kii samasyaon ne film ko kisi bhi tarah prabhavit nahin kiya
 Actually, there were reports in the middle that both the shootings were not comfortable with each other, due to which the shooting was not being done properly
 ranvir-katrina ke phansco to is film kaa besabri se intjaar hoga or wo chahenge ki donon apane bich kii problems ko bhuulakar shoot achche se karen

 bihar sarkaar ke mantri lalan singh ne kaha ki agar sibiai ne 2008 main railway tender maamle kii jaanch shuru kii hoti to argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav abhi tak sajaa paa chuke hote
 But then the UPA government gave the task of investigating the matter to the Railways by not giving the investigation to the CBI
 bihar sarkaar main jalasansaadhan mantri rajeev ranjan urf lalan singh ne sabase pehle 2008 main railway ke tender ke badale jameen kaa maamla uthaaya tha
 Lalan Singh had all documentary evidence against Laloo Prasad Yadav at that time that the Railways had taken land in Patna in lieu of giving the BNR Hotel in Ranchi and the Railway Hotel in Bhubaneswar in private hands
 lalan singh ne kaha ki ye jameen patna ke chanakya hotel ke maalik vijay kochar or vinay kochar kii thi or railway hotel kaa tender bhi unhen hi mila
 At that time, the land which was received in lieu of tender was given to Delight Marketing Company
 jisaki malkin sarala gupta thim or jo argedy ke netaa premchand gupta kii patni thim
 This land has been registered in lieu of giving a hotel to the railway, so it becomes a case of corruption
 lalan singh ne kaha ki ham logon ne tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko saare daastavej saunpe or vistaar se baat bataai
 People believed that Manmohan Singh would conduct an impartial investigation, but later it was found that the inquiry was given to the Railway Ministry itself
 jiske viruddh bhrashtachar kaa aarope he
 This was the case of Lipa granddaughter, Lalu Prasad Yadav was in government at that time
 aaj yah sabit ho gaya ki wo jameen lalu prasad yadav kii thi
 At that time the company was made a medium
 ye isliye bhi saaf ho gaya ki 2011 ke baad dilite marketing company ke saare share lalu prasad yadav ke parivaar ke paas aa gaye or doosraa koi bhi is company kaa share dharak nahin rahaa
 Lallan Singh said that if the case had been conducted in a fair investigation in 2008, this action would have taken place at the same time
 lekin ajasibiai nishpaksh jaanchaki taraf bad rahi he
 Lallan Singh said that there is strong evidence in this case, there are ground papers
 us jameen ke alag bagal waalon se bhi jameen likhavai or evaj main naukari di in sabake saboot maujuud hai
 There were some people who were witnesses in the fodder scam, their land was also written
 lalan singh ke mutabik is maamle main argedy adhyakshalalu prasad yadavaka nikalnaa mushkil he
 Because the direction in which the CBI is moving with impunity seems that it will reach its final culmination
 lalan singh kaa kahana he ki lalu prasad yadav ne hi apane bete ko is maamle main fansaaya he
 Destruction black contrast wisdom If Lalu Yadav had to bring his son into politics, then what was the need of making this property in the name of Tejashwi Yadav
 ye to vaise hi vaaris hone ke naate tejasvi yadav ke naam ho jaati
 In the 17th Asian Games, the Indian hockey team lost 1-2 against their arch-rivals Pakistan
 is haar kii jimmedaar khud bhartiya team rahi, kyonki unhone gol daagne ke kai shandaar maukey ganvaae or ant main match bhi ganvaa diya
 There were no goals in the first two quarters but Pakistan took the lead in the third quarter
 uski taraf se yah gol mohammad umr bhutta ne 38wein minute main kiya
 India equalized in the fourth quarter but Pakistan immediately hit back and scored a decisive goal
 bharat ke liye nickin thimmaiya (53wein minute) ne jabaki pakistan ke liye mohammad vakaas (54wein minute) ne gol kiya
 The match was really exciting and as expected both teams of the subcontinent got to see interesting matches
 donon tiimon ne tejatarraar hockey kheli or apane kaushal kaa bejod namoona pesh kiya
 The two teams tried to outperform each other, but in the end the Sardar Singh-led team came out of the stadium disappointed
 bharat kii haar kaa kaaran gol karne ke kai maukey ganvaana rahaa
 Ramandeep Singh, in particular, allowed many opportunities to go by hand, while Rakshapakanti also looked shattered under pressure on some occasions
 is jeet se pakistan ne ek tarah se pool bi main top sthaan sunishchit kar liya he, jabaki bharat ke liye paristhitiyaan kadi ho gai hai
 He can now remain in second place in Pool b and in such a situation he may have to face a strong South Korea team in the semi-finals
 lekin iske liye bhi bharat ko shanivaar ko apane aakhri pool match main kam ranking ke lekin khatarnaak china se paar paanaa hoga
 VR Raghunath was responsible for the penalty corner due to injury to Rupinder Pal Singh but the drag flicker continued to perform poorly and he missed opportunities
 pakistani cirkil ke andar ramandeep singh kii treping bhi acchhee nahin rahi or unhone kam se gol karne ke teen maukey ganvaae
 In the second quarter, Akashdeep Singh's shot went straight to goalkeeper Imran Butt
 pakistan ko bhi gol karne ke maukey mili
 Waqas had a golden opportunity in the second quarter when he had only Indian goalkeeper PR Sreejesh in front but his shot went out
 pehle do quarter main bharat or pakistan donon ne ek ek penlti corner par naakaam koshish kii
 In the third quarter, Vikas's shot was blocked by Sreejesh but Bhutta scored on the rebound to give the defending champion an edge
 bharat ne iske baad aakraamak ravaiya apanaaya or chauthe or aakhri quarter main usne pakistani rakshapankti ko kaaphi vyast rakhaa lekin gol nahin ho paaya
 Danish Mujtaba reached the position of scoring an equalizer in the 49th minute but his deflection on Kothajit Singh's pass was blocked beautifully by the Pakistani goalkeeper
 bharat ko lagaataar prayaason kaa fal 53wein minute main jab thimmaiya ne kothajit ke cross par barabari kaa gol daaga lekin bharat kii khushiyaan adhik der tak nahin tik pai or vakaas ne reverse hit se nirnaayak gol daag diya
 Pakistan are now top in Pool b with three wins
 vah apane aakhri match main kamjor oman se bhidega

 What is the secret of the rape accused Narayan Sai, who allegedly collected Rs 13 crore to weaken his case? Are there some big names behind this deal? Are Surat police deliberately protecting them? If not, then can a minor sub inspector alone make a deal of Rs 5 crore out of 13? Then only 5 crore rupees were recovered from this amount
 baaki 8 karod kahaan gaye? aakhir kya he 13 karod ke is rishwat cond kaa sach?surat police kii krime branch ke sab-inspector siem kumbhaani par aarope he ki usne surat police ko kharidne ke liye narayan sai se paanch karod kii deal kii thi
 The deal was that in lieu of five crores, Surat police would weaken the ongoing rape case against Narayan Sai and would be quick to catch the remaining accused in the case
 ab sawaal ye he ki kya ek akelaa sab inspector akele itnaa bada kaam kar saktaa he? wo bhi tab jabaki wo na to cese kaa aaio yani jaanch adhikari he or na hi tafteesh se sidhe judaa he
 Then due to the high profile case, all the top officers of Surat Police are also keeping a close watch on this matter
 surat police ke kamishnar kaa kahana he ki sab inspector kumbhaani is saazish main akelaa tha
 That is, the rest of the police officers were not involved in this deal
 lekin sawaal yah he ki deal main koi aalaa police afasar shaamil hi nahin hua to phir deal ke tahat bataur peshgi ek karod rupye kiske liye the jo 12 disambar kii shaam police ne surat ke gandhi cirkil ke paas car se jabt kiye?ek karod kii baramadagi ke baad aropiyon kii nishandehi par police ne baaki ke chaar karod bhi baraamad kar liye
 Now it is clear that the entire five crore rupees were for the Surat Police only
 or ye baat khud pulisakmishnar ne bhi maani he
 It is clear from the recovery of these five crores that the deal was finalized and after that, these five crores reached Surat
 sutron ke mutabik surat police ke alaava nyaaypalika or jail prashasan se bhi narayan sai ke gurg kuch bade samparkon kii madad se deal tay kar chuke the or unhen peshgi kii kuch rakam bhi adaa kii ja chuki he
 According to sources, Narayan Sai was doing all this deal for a leader and he is also the real master mind of this 13 crore plot
 surat police ne 13 karod ke is rishwatkand kaa sach jaanane ke liye 6 ipies afasaron kii ek jaanch team banaai he
 This investigation team will not only investigate the role of the judiciary, government doctors and the jail administration but will also break the role of senior officers of Surat Police
 narayan sai ne surat police ko paanch karod main kharidne kii koshish kii thi
 But out of these 4 crores alone he was giving 42 sacks instead
 darasal surat police ke malkhane main rakhi in 42 borio main narayan sai se jude tamaam dastavej, computer or hard discs hai
 Narayan wanted the police to store 42 bags of garbage in the consignment and return the original sacks
 surat police ne narayan kii faraari ke dauraan ahmedabad ke uske ashram par chapa maar kar vahaan se kul 42 bori dastavej jabt kiye the
 In addition to all the documents, Narayan Sai's computer, laptop, hard disk, CD were all included in these documents
 darasal jis wagon aar car se ek karod rupye mili hai usee car main ek bori bhi rakhi thi
 The sack was exactly the same as Narayan Sai's 42 sacks filled with documents in the police's possession
 car se baraamad bori main asaram baapu ke yahaan chhapane vaali patrika bhari thi
 Actually it was a sample sack
 ishara ye tha ki isi tarah kii 42 boriyaan aaengi jise police malkhane main band un 42 boriyon se badal diya jayega

 aansu ponchhate hue security guard bas itani hi bol paaya, kudarat ab jaalim ho chali he
 Since childhood, i have learned this lesson in the lesson of moral education that one should not play with nature
 chote bachche se bada ho chalaa hum, par ye sabak main or mujh jaise bahut se log ab bhi nahin sikh paae hai
 Sadly, even the nature that chronicles such old and sad hearts with one of its air gusts has not been able to grow
 hamaari kudarat ab sukun pahunchane vaali kudarat nahin, peshewar ho chali he
 Revenge nature
 hajaaron laashon kii chaati par rote-peetate haath or udhaas nigahen aaj tumhaari vajah se pathar ho chali hai
 After the earthquake on Saturday, you again got a new look
 khabaron se judaa kaam he to tumhaare badla lene ke dauraan daftar main tha
 Fear of running out of people's office and after a few moments, saw people laughing at your game
 tumhaari ghadi yani suraj jaise jaise daaen se baayen kii taraf badi, daftar or baahar kaam kar rahe logon ke chehre par chaunkati ankhon ko dukh se timatimaate dekhne laga
 Felt very bad koi fark nahin laga tum main or ham insaanon main
 Naturally, your heart has also become smaller, like us humans
 himalay jaisaa seenaa liye tum aaj bhi ek ghor kalyugi insaan kii tarah dikhaai di, jo badla lene or khud ko upar rakhane ke iraade se jindagi ke bich safar main logon ko dhokhaa de dete hai
 Thinking about the earthquake instead of you, i saw the first news of yesterday's newspaper
 falaan gaanv main kisaan ne kii khudakushi
 The total number increased to vajah vahi, barish
 Sometimes because of less rain, sometimes because of more rain
 tum itani pathar dil ho chali ho ki shahar main kii hamaari chhedchhad kaa badla gaanv main mehnat karne vaale garib kisaanon se lene lagi ho
 You are more than any government and leader responsible for the death of farmers
 gaanv ko tabah kar shahar banane vaale barish ke aane par samose chaay kaa lutf uthaate hue fasebuk apadet or ai lav rain karte rahe tum barish ke jariye kahar barsaati rahi
 Amidst the applause of the city, you did not see the crops standing in the village and the sweaty clothes of the farmers hanging in the khunis of the houses
 khadi fasalein tumhaari tej barish kii vajah se langadi hokar gir padin or jin kheton se kisaan ke parivaar ko fasal kii ummid thi, vahaan unke bete-baap-bhai-pati kii laash ugane lagi
 If nature ever gets rid of havoc, think of what it would be like to see someone's dead body hanging in the fields instead of crops
 ham insaan tumhaare pahaado kii tarah pathar nahin hue hai
 Seeing the body of your loved ones, a volcano explodes inside the chest
 bas cheekhney kii aawaaj kuch der main shant ho jaati he
 But you have slowly moved from a calm nature to a terrible revenge nature in the face of your hard heart and revenge
 kudarat, tumse chhedchhad or dakhal ke liye tumse maafee maangana mahaj dikhaava hoga
 So i would just like to say one thing to you, one of the installments of nature is from the smile of man that he has acquired from you
 ham logon kii jindagi main ab bhi ek sukun dene vaali mamata kaa sahaara kudarat hi he
 You're the one
 insaan ko uski galatiyon ke liye ek bade dil vaali kudarat kii tarah maaf karne or tumhen kam ahmiyat dene kaa adhikaar dete hue hamen wo saare haq do, jab ham tumhaare shukraguzaar rahen
 In the same way as my childhood grandfather, before lighting a lamp in the house on Diwali, in the middle of a field, he used to say, 'wake the earth mother wake up'

 Significantly, former Delhi Chief Minister and State Congress Committee President Sheila Dixit died on Saturday
 vah 81 saal kii thim
 She was the Chief Minister of Delhi for 15 years between 1998 and 2013
 I'm devastated to hear about the passing away of Sheila Dikshit Ji, a beloved daughter of the Congress Party, with whom i shared a close personal bond
 My condolences to her family & the citizens of Delhi, whom she served selflessly as a 3 term CM, in this time of great grief
 shila dikshit kaa antim sanskaar ravivaar ko 2:30 baje dilli ke nigam bodh ghat main hoga

 antim sanskaar se pehle shila dikshit ke parthiv sharir ko antim darshan ke liye kal subah congress mukhyalay main bhi rakhaa jayega
 Let me tell you that in January this year, he was made the president by handing over the command of the Congress in Delhi
 is baar unhone uttar purvi dilli se chunaav bhi ladaa tha lekin ve chunaav haar gayi thi
 Sheila Dixit, who has held Delhi's power for 15 years as the Chief Minister from 1998 to 2013, has previously been a Member of Parliament from Kannauj (UP) from 1984 to 89
 is dauraan ve loksabhaa kii samitiyon main rahane ke saath-saath sanyukt raashtra main mahilaon ke ayog main bharat kii pratinidhi raheen
 She has also been a Union Minister in the Rajiv Gandhi government
 shila dikshit 1998 se 2013 tak lagaataar 15 saal dilli kii mukhyamantri raheen
 However, in 2013, Sheila Dixit's government was swept away by the Aam Aadmi Party boom
 haalanki, mana jaataa he ki shila dikshit kii haar main anti inakambency bhi haaavee rahaa
 After this, she was also the Governor of Kerala in 2014
 shila dikshit kaa janm 31 march, 1938 ko punjab ke kapoorthala main hua
 Sheila Dixit earned a master's degree in history from Miranda House, University of Delhi
 unka vivaah unnav (upi) ke iees adhikari swargeey vinod dikshit se hua tha

 Former Pakistan cricket team captain Zaheer Abbas believes that his team's claim to the World Cup to be held in the subcontinent from 19 February to 2 April is weak
 samachar patr 'da express tribune' ne abbaas ke hawaale se likhaa he, "pakistan vishwa cap jeetne kaa daavedaar nahin he
 The team's World Cup preparations have suffered a lot due to the spot-fixing controversy
 " vishwa cap main pakistan ko group 'e' main rakhaa gaya he jisamen australia, newjiland or srilanka jaisi majboot timen shaamil hai
 According to the letter, Abbas said, "the experience and lack of talent of the three players Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amer, who were suspended in the spot-fixing case, will eat the team into the World Cup
" " abbaas kii najaron main vishwa cap khitaab jeetne kaa prabal daavedaar bharat, austrailia, dakshin africa or england kii timen hai
 Abbas said, "pakistan should do a 'clean sweep' in the current one-day series being played with New Zealand
" main pehle ekadivasiy main mili haar se behad niraash hum
 "abbas expressed confidence that the young players' performance in the World Cup would be superb
 america raashtrapati baraak obama kii bharat yatra ke dauraan donon deshon kii jo badi uplabdhi bataai gai vah yah thi ki parmaanu samjhaute ko lagu karne kii raah main atka roda hat gaya he
 However, how it happened at that time and what is fine print was not told
 ab videsh mantralay ne aksar puche jane vaale 19 sawaalon kaa jawaab diya gaya he
 What comes out of this question and answer is that the matter is only on how the Indian laws which are being considered as a hurdle in the face of the accident, will be explained in real terms
 in sawaalon ke jawaab se yah lagata he ki asal main parmaanu riektaron main haadase kii surat main jo harjaana hoga, vah riector chalaane vaale ko yani oparator ko dena hoga
 The law provides that the operator can claim damages on the goods and fuel supplier if he so desires
 lekin yahaan par samajhane vaali baat yah he ki oparator koun hoga
 Actually, this operator is the government company Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL) and the government says that it will definitely ask for damages in the event of an accident
 or to or ye daawa is par bhi nirbhar karegaa ki saamaan aapurti karne vaali company se qaraar main iskaa praavdhaan he yaa nahin
 It is not difficult to understand that Indian citizens can sue the government company in court, the amount of compensation that has been decided will be given by the government company to its citizens, but whether or not they ask for compensation from the spillar will depend on the government and the Indian citizen
 Will not be able to ask for damages from foreign companies
 haalanki yah praavdhaan - civil newclear liblity damege act 2010 ke section 46 ke tahat he or duniya main har jagah yahi maanya he
 As far as the insurance pool of 1500 crores is concerned, that too will be made from our tax money
 haalanki sarkaar yah daawa kar rahi he ki isse parmaanu riektaron se milane vaali bijli kii keemat kuch paise hi badhegi
 Despite all this, due to the lack of clear legal provisions on paper, foreign companies such as GE and toshiba-westinghouse, who are suppliers, are not confident at the moment
 yahaan jis ek chiz par sarkaar kii chali he vah parmaanu eendhan ko shuru se ant tak trek karne kii america maang jise bharat ne nahin mana, or america is par peeche hat gaya
 So after looking at all these facts, in the end the question is the same, is there really anything changed on the nuclear deal? And if yes, India has moved two steps forward or two steps backward

 vibhinn muddon par rahul ke pradhanmantri ko gherne ke bare main puche jane par smriti ne kaha, 'pradhanmantri narendra modi khud hi yah kah chuke hai, rahul gandhi ko aage aana chahie or kisi bhi mudde par baat kerani chahie
 He can speak in Parliament or in front of us
 'kendriya mantri ne kaha ki agarsansad main nahin to vah televijanpar bahes ke liye aa sakate hai
 Our National President (amit Shah) can participate in it
 vah (rahul) hamaare kisi bhi party kaaryakarta ko chunane ke liye swatantra hai, ham bahes ke liye taiyaar hai, lekin vah koi kitaab athwa kaagaj kaa tukdaa apane saath na laaen

 However, after landing on the Eden Gardens, he achieved a major feat
 darasal, dhoni team india kii ore se apane 300wein vanade main khilne utre
 Talking about the overall ODI of Dhoni's career, Dhoni's total ODI number is 303
 aisa isliye kyonki dhoni ne 2007 main teen vanade asia ilevan kii ore se khel the
 Those 3 matches have also been added to Dhoni's ODI career
 is lihaaj se dhoni ne srilanka ke khilaaf 31 agast ko hi apane vanade kariyar kaa 300waan match puraa kar liya tha
 Before the match started, Virat Kohli not only honored the former captain of Team India by offering mementos, but whatever he said, it made his fans very emotional
 viraat ne maidan nen saare khilaadiyon ke bich dhoni ko moment pregent karte hue kaha tha- hamamen se 90 pratishat khilaadiyon ne aapke captain rahete apana kariyar shuru kiya

 Dhoni has become the sixth Indian to join the 300 ODI cricketers' club Sachin Tendulkar (1989-2012) 463 ODI Rahul Dravid (1996 - 2011) 2000-2017) 304 odis Dhoni (2004-2017) 303 odis purvottar ke teen rajyon meghalaya, nagaland or tripura main shanivaar kadi suraksha vyavastha ke bich matganana hogi

 The Assembly has 60 seats each in these three states, but for some reason, voting was held in 59-59 seats in all three
 teen rajyon main huavidhansabha chunaavonke maton kii ginati shanivaar ko hogi
 The BJP has kept high hopes from the assembly elections held in Meghalaya, Tripura and Nagaland, but the results of Tripura are the most awaited
 log dekhnaa chaahate hai ki bijepi 25 saal se satta main barkaraar communist shashan ko ukhaad paati he yaa nahin
 The results of the assembly elections in the North East states have never been so important to the rest of India, but the strength of the BJP in these elections and the visits of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made it very special

 In Tripura, BJP has contested elections in alliance, while in Nagaland BJP is dreaming of reaching 31 seats from one seat

 Our experience of growing old in everyday life can be complex, but on screen we are given exaggerated roles or strange roles such as the film Black
 aisi bhartiya filmein durlabh hi hai, jo ghise-pite dhaanchon se alag hai
 Movies showing the elderly as separate from the built-in emotional structure are even rarer
 marathi film astu (2013) jo 29 june ko dilli main 61wein rashtriya film mahotsav ke dauraan dikhaai gai, un durlabh filmon main se ek he
 This is a milestone film, because it raises many difficult questions without getting bogged down in gimmicky sentimentality: When you lose the ability to recognize love, how should other people love you
 jab yaaddaasht kamjor pad jaati he to kya hota he
 And what is the nature of a gift given to a stranger
 yah asaadhaaran film juthi bhavukta se bachate hue inhen sawaalon ke ird-gird gumti he
 In this, the subject of mental imbalance arising due to old age has been taken towards a deeper search for memory, love, sorrow and compassion
 pune ke chakrapani shastri sanskrit ke ritred professor hai
 His elder daughter Ira quietly sees his mental balance deteriorating with despair
 use salaah di jaati he ki vah apane pita ko vriddhashram main daal de
 But seeing the pitiable condition of such ashrams, she decides to bring her father to her and her doctor husband's house
 ek din ira pita ko apane saath laane ke liye unke ghar pahunch jaati he
 At one place she parked her car and tells them that she will return soon
 yah boodha baccha car se baahar jhankata he vah dekhtaa he ki ek aadmi apni choti beti or ek hathi ko lekar aa rahaa he
 He is about to earn a living by riding elephants to children
 professor shastri chahak uthte hai
 They give Rs 500 to the owner of the elephant
 kaa note dikhaate hue ishaara karte hai
 They want to ride elephants
 hathi kii peeth par ab do bachche savaar hai: hathi ke maalik kii beti, jiske liye sawari ek yaad ban jaaegi or boodha professor, jo shaayad apni hi yaadon kii sawari kar rahaa he
 It is strangely difficult for an elephant's poor owner
 uske paas apana koi ghar nahin he, lekin ek aise aadmi ko sawari kara rahaa he, jiske paas ghar to he, lekin waapas ghar jane kaa rasta bhul gaya he
 However, the owner of the elephant does not leave the old man alone on the way
 din dhalane par vah professor ko nadi ke tat par bane apane parivaar ke tent main le jaataa he
 Meanwhile, Shastri's family is very upset
 police ko suchit kiya jaataa he or kai sambandhiyon se poochtacha kii jaati he
 Eventually Professor Shastri is found
 hathi kaa maalik or uski patni police vaale ke saamne khud ko nirdosh bataane kii koshish karte hai
 They have to apologize in return for caring for a helpless old man
 hamen aam jindagi main yah bidambnaa aksar dekhne ko milti he or ham sochate hai ki kisi phaayde ke bina koi kisi kii madad kyon karegaa
 Perhaps the most memorable moment of this film is where the poor woman, who has become like the mother of an old man, consoles the daughter
 film kaa ant‚Äîvah kshan jo alag-alag dishaao main ja rahe donon pariwaron ko jodta he‚Äîbahut maarmik he
 This film puts forth a gift that is extremely rare in today's world and that is compassion and sympathy, that too unconditionally
 vaastavik karunaa, jo daan kii simaaon tak simit nahin he or hamen sahi arthon main insaan banaati he
 There are some important questions that Astu forces us to ask
 budhaape or buudhon ke liye dayaneey tathaa aparyaapt suvidhaon se judi mahatvapurn samasyaon ke baavjood ham is sthiti ko sweekaar karne ko taiyaar kyon nahin hai
 And despite glorifying the elders in the Indian culture, is it not right that the youth are being worshiped more in the current culture? Have we fallen victim to cultural oblivion at this time, where we are only able to remember a small part of life? Astu provides a sample for us to question what will happen to us after passing the youth stage
 We are told a lot about the youth of youth, but it is not told what will happen in old age

 Sanjay Srivastava is Professor of Sociology at Jawaharlal Nehru University manipur main sena dwaara farji encounter maamle main daayar yachika par sunwaayee ke dauraan centre sarkaar ne supreme court main kaha ki elosi par koun fire karegaa, yah court faisla nahin kar saktaa
 The granting of more rights to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) than the powers given to it by the Parliament would be to enact a judicial law
 centre kii ore se atarni general (agi) mukul rohtagi ne yah daleel us mudde par di jisamen kaha gaya ki encountaron kii jaanch esaiti se karai jaae yaa phir enechaarsi se
 The AG said that the Manipur encounter cannot be investigated by the Human Rights Commission nor can it be compelled to follow its recommendations
 vahiin maanavadhikaar ayog kii ore se kaha gaya ki vah encounter kii jaanch karne ko taiyaar he bhale hi uske paas logon kii kami he
 It was also said that its recommendations are binding on the government
 supreme court is maamle kii 26 or 27 sitambar ko sunwaayee karegaa
 In Manipur, the Supreme Court is hearing a petition filed by the army in a fake encounter case
 pichhali sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne faisla dete hue kaha tha ki agar 'afsapa' laga he or ilaaka disturb aria ke tahat clacyphid bhi he to bhi sena yaa police atyaadhik force kaa istemaal nahin kar sakate
 The court also said that the Criminal Court has the right to trial the encounter cases
 supreme court ne kaha tha ki sena or police ke zyada force or encountaron kii swatantra jaanch honi chahie
 This agency will decide later which agency will conduct this investigation
 tippaniyan The Supreme Court had also sought detailed information on the 1528 encounters in Manipur
 supreme court ne 'amikes curi' se un sab 62 maamalon kii states report maangi thi jinhen justise santosh hegade yaa enechaarsi ne farji bataaya tha
 The court had said that the army is free to conduct a court of inquiry in every case
 supreme court main daakhil yachika main encounter maamalon kii jaanch sibiai yaa esaiti se karaane kii maang kii gai thi
 The army is accused of carrying out fake encounters of around 1500 people between 2000 and 2012
 haalanki sunwaayee ke dauraan centre sarkaar ne in aaropon ko bebuniyaad bataate hue kaha tha ki bhartiya sena ne javaabi karrwai ke tahat yah encounter kiye the
 This action the army had to take to prevent foreign forces and protect the sovereignty of the country
 varsh 2013 main banaai gai justise santosh hegade kii cameti ne 1500 encountaron kii jaanch kii sifarish kii thi
 The Center has demanded the cancellation of this report
 haalanki supreme court ne kareeb aath maamlo kii jaanch ke aadesh die the
 On behalf of the Center, Attorney General (AG) Mukul Rohatgi gave this argument on the issue that the encounters should be investigated by SIT or NHRC
 agi ne kaha ki manipur encounter kii jaanch maanavadhikaar ayog se nahin karai ja sakati or naa hi uski siforeeshon ko maanane ke liye baadhya kiya ja saktaa he
 On the other hand, it was said by the Human Rights Commission that it is ready to investigate the encounter even if it is short of people
 saath hi yah bhi kaha gaya ki uski siforishein sarkaar par badhyakaari hai
 The Supreme Court will hear the case on 26 and 27 September
 manipur main sena dwaara farji encounter maamle main daayar yachika par supreme court sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 During the last hearing, the Supreme Court had given the verdict that even if the 'AFSPA' is in place and the area is classified under the disturbed area, then the army or police cannot use excessive force
 court ne yah bhi kaha tha ki criminal court ko encounter maamalon ke trial kaa adhikaar he
 The Supreme Court had said that more forces and encounters of army and police should be investigated independently
 koun si agency yah jaanch karegi, yah court baad main tay karegaa
 The comments supreme court ne manipur ke 1528 encountaron kii vistrut jaankaree bhi maangi thi
 The Supreme Court had sought the status report of all 62 cases from 'amix Curiae', which were justified by Justice Santosh Hegde or NHRC
 court ne kaha tha sena har cese main court aaf inquayri karne ko swatantra he
 In the petition filed in the Supreme Court, the CBI or SIT was required to investigate the encounter cases
 sena par 2000 se 2012 ke bich kareeb 1500 logon kaa farji encounter karne kaa aarope he
 However, during the hearing, the Central Government had termed these allegations as baseless and said that the Indian Army had done these encounters as a retaliation
 yah karrwai sena ko videshi takaton ko rokane or desh kii samprabhutaa kii raksha karne ke liye kerani padi
 The Committee of Justice Santosh Hegde, constituted in the year 2013, recommended the investigation of 1500 encounters
 centre ne is report ko radd karne kii maang kii he
 However, the Supreme Court had ordered an inquiry into about eight cases
 vahiin maanavadhikaar ayog kii ore se kaha gaya ki vah encounter kii jaanch karne ko taiyaar he bhale hi uske paas logon kii kami he

 In the petition filed in the Supreme Court, the CBI or SIT was required to investigate the encounter cases
 sena par 2000 se 2012 ke bich kareeb 1500 logon kaa farji encounter karne kaa aarope he
 However, during the hearing, the Central Government had termed these allegations as baseless and said that the Indian Army had done these encounters as a retaliation

 Sonia, in a statement, appreciated the remarkable efforts of ISRO scientists

 ''congress adhyaksh ne kaha, ''yah hamaare vaigyanikon kii ullekhneey kshamta, khyaati or har bhartiya ke dil main unke liye khaas jagah hone kaa pramaan he
 He said, "the journey of Chandrayaan has been a little long, but the history of ISRO is full of such examples that there was hope in the hope

 On the other hand, in this storm, three BJP players kept their feet like Angad, so the BJP box was saved from being rounded and the party won three seats

 However, like the BJP, the Congress candidates could not compete and the common men piled up in front of the party candidates

 The party has three names in the havoc of the Aam Aadmi Party and the BJP candidates who hold their own fort

 Doesn't this sound a little odd? That today, even after nearly a century, we stand at the same old place in the modern packaging of love as an indelible emotion in films and novels
 nae yug main waisi packaging to barkaraar he, lekin pack apane aap main khaali he
 There is no dearth of shops which are selling cheap prices of Prem indiscriminately
 isi ke saath-saath ham un filmon kii ore bhaag rahe hai, jinamein shaayad hi kabhi aisi bharosemand kahani dikhaai jaati ho, jo bataae ki prem amit or sadaa ke liye hota he
 Along with this, India Today Sex Survey 2016 is also showing that the fantasy of lasting love is slowly fading
 survey dikhaata he ki yah bhaavana desh ke khaas kar chote shaharon main bahut teji se ksheen hoti ja rahi he
 What should we say about the arrow that rips the layers of a delicate heart
 prem kaa ant kaise ho jaataa he? or aakhir aisa kyon he ki upar se jo kuch bhi thos or majboot dikhaai detaa tha, vah chote shaharon kii hawa main gaayab hota ja rahaa he?lekin pehle kuch chaunkaane vaale aankade
 The report of the survey says that in metros (other than its partner), there are relatively less (10-12 per cent) cases of courtship with someone else, whereas in Tier-2 category cities with someone other than their partner
 The percentage of love affairs cases is relatively high
 dil kii chanchalta ke aankadon kii suchi main ahmedabad sabase upar he, jahaan yah sankhya 26 fisadi he
 This is followed by Kochi (21 per cent) and Ranchi (20)

 For some years, Gurgaon has also taken the form of a big city
 kuchhek saal pehle isi gudgaanv se lage ek gaanv main kuch yuvaaon se baat karte hue mujhe pataa chalaa ki vailentaines de ko ve apni premicaon ke saath gudgaanv ke mal main jaaya karte hai, jabaki unki biviyaan gharon main hoti thim
 The village of aspirations is also no more behind than the non-metro city
 vivahetar sambandh ab koi nai baat nahin rah gaye hai
 But what is new in all this is the feeling of fullness or saturation in intimate relationships
 tripti kii yah khoj or chahat jivan kaa lakshya ban chuki he
 Earlier generations and especially women were tied in the rigid bond of marriage and they had to maintain it throughout their life
 lekin ab duusari bahut-si chizon kii tarah sambandh bhi ek aakanksha kii vastu ban chuke hai
 It has become a continuous search
 lekin yah itnaa rochak vishay kyon ho gaya he ki is tarah kii 'gatividh' ab ham gaiyr-metro shaharon main dekh rahe hai, or isse bhi zyada rochak baat yah kyon he ki ab log iske bare main khulkar baat karnaa chaahate hai?paripurnataa or santrupti kii yah talash shaadishuda sambandhon main puri nahin ho paati
 Non-metro cities have become a symbol of modern times in terms of seeking this fulfillment
 ranchi or sholapur (or jamshedpur tathaa durgapur) main nai chijen (pizza) or jagahen (mal or cafe) aa rahi hai
 Along with this, there is also a desire among the youth to change themselves according to the new age
 kaamanaayon kii is fantasy main ve gharelu bandhanon se mukt jivan kii kalpana karne lage hai
 But the question is, why is this kind of desire especially in non-metro cities? One possible reason may be that the metropolis offers plenty of options to express oneself, to make a career, to have fun and to eat
 vahiin gaiyr-metro shaharon main sthiti thik ulat he
 For inner expression there is to move oneself because this is the only thing within their reach
 yahi vajah he ki ve apane vichaar zyada khulkar vyakt karte hai or zyada saahsee dikhaai dete hai
 The purpose of openness is to express oneself and convey meaning
 jaise ki ahmedabad ke logon ko aap yah kehete hue sun sakate hai ki dilli or mumbai ke alaava or bhi bahut-si jagahen hai, jahaan jindagi or sambhaavnaaen hai, jahaan aap kaaphi kuch kar sakate hai
 The rest of our lives are beyond our reach and grip, but at least this self-expression is in our hands
 sex survey kii report bataati he ki gaiyr-metro shaharon main ujjwal bhavishya kii talash main maujuuda paristhitiyon ke daldal se nikal bhaagane kii ghatnaayen sabase teji se ghatit ho rahi hai
 31 of Pune
 3 fisadi uttardaataaon kaa kahana he ki log vivahetar sambandhon ke prati aasaani se aakarshith ho jate hai
 Chandigarh and Gurgaon topped the list for having love affairs with more than one person
 bevafa partneron or samooh sex ke maamle main kochi awwal he
 Non-metro cities are actually stuck somewhere between the city and the village
 yahaan kii aadaten or vyavhaar gaanv kii chaay kii dukaan or shahari cafe coffee de ke bich kaa he
 He has left the sociality of the village and has come forward, but is also hesitant to mix in the free sociality of the city
 isliye na to vah is taraf he, or na us taraf
 In these cities girls wear kurta tops with jeans and boys wear false vows in the ears of their girlfriends as they are preparing for marriage with the choice of parents
 kabhi-kabhi aisa bhi hota he ki unka prem bhartiya parampara ke anusaar shaadi kii shakl le letaa he, jise 'prem or paaramparik vivaah' kaa naam diya jaataa he
 But generally, non-metro cities have been able to slowly reach a state of subduing at a low flame with a mixture of rural regulations and industrial desires
 abhi isamen ubaal aayaa nahin he
 But this current report of sex survey can become a news of a big change
 thode-se naaraaz purush or mahilaayein aadat or chahat ke bich fark karnaa sikh rahe hai
 In a society where habits are instilled and desires are discouraged
 gaiyr-metro shaharon main vivahetar sambandhon kii saamaajik sweekaaryata to nahin, phir bhi ve bad rahe hai
 37 per cent of people in Chennai who do not realize love and 22 in Indore
 5 fisadi log jo teen se zyada baar prem kar chuke hai, shaayad is sachaai ko sweekaar kar rahe hai ki ichha main agar koi cheez sthaayee he to vah he chapaltaa yani man kisi ek ke saath tikkar rahane vaala nahin
 Meaning, this is the true nature of humans
 iskaa yah bhi matlab he ki vivaah ab sirf saamaajikta or sampatti se judi ek vyavastha he, jisamen kisi anya ke saath antarang sambandh kii icchhaaen khatm nahin ho jaatin
 However, it is also true that even a 'true' love marriage is no guarantee of greater happiness than a traditional marriage
 lekin iske baavjood yah ummid jarur jagaata he ki donon ko ek-duusare se sukh mil saktaa he
 Yes, it is not necessarily the same happiness as he wants
 phir bhi kuch had tak yah miltaa hi he
 25 of non-metro cities like Ranchi
 5 fisadi log yah kehete hai ki unhen prem kaa koi ehsaas nahin he
 But at the same time they are part of a much larger non-metro population that is involved in extramarital affairs
 jaahir he, ve kisi duusari jagah santushti paa rahe hai
 Certainly not in the relationship in which they are tied
 ghar main nahin, shaayad shopping mal main
 But at the same time, we should also remember that there has not been any major increase in the incidence of marriage breakdown as an institution
 vivaah banaae rakhane ke saath hi kisi duusare vyakti se antarang sambandh bananaa ek anokhi bhartiya pravriti ho sakati he
 Therefore, if India Today's sex survey reveals some facts about the stability of marriage as well as the fickleness of the heart, it is this: the respondents are not ready to break their marriage for intimate relationship with another
