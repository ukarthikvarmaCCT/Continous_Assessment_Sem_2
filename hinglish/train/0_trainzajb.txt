 Bollywood veteran Seema Biswas played Phoolan Devi in the film Bandit Queen
 film main behtareen adaakaari ke liye unhen neshnal aword bhi mila
 In an interview, he spoke openly about shooting his role and intimate scene in the film Bandit Queen
 10 agast, 1963 ko phulan devi kaa janm hua tha
 Whatever struggles he faced in his life, Shekhar Kapoor showed it with all sincerity through the film
 film ko bhi duniyabar main saraahaa gaya
 There were some scenes in the film that were not easy to shoot
 ham aapako bataa rahe hai ki phulan devi kaa role adaa karne vaali seemaa biswas ko shooting ke dauraan kis tarah kii dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The film was highly controversial due to bold scenes, abusive and nude scenes
 haalanki, is seen ko seemaa ne khud nahin balki body dabl ne kiya tha
 According to Seema, he had asked the director Shekhar Kapur to remove the nude scenes from the film, but Shekhar said that in order to show the insensitivity of the people in this film based on the Satya incident, it is necessary to do that scene
 seemaa ne khulaasa kiya ki is seen ko shoot karte samay diarector or cameraman ke alaava kisi kaa bhi andar aana manaa tha
 Due to this nude scene, he had to cry overnight
 is neude seen ko filmaane ke baad puri unit itani dukhi or vyathit ho gai ki sabhi kii ankhon main aansu aa gaye
 Apart from this, in another scene of the film, after gang rape, Thakur's character sends Phoolan Devi's character to fetch water from the well
 unhone kaha ki is bare main mere gharavaalon ko pataa tha
 Not only this, two years before the release, the Biswas family saw the uncensored copy of the film at their home in Assam
 is dauraan seemaa maa kii god main sir rakhkar sone kaa naatak kar rahi thim
 At the same time, doors and curtains were installed and there was silence in the room
 seemaa ne kamare kii lite band kar di
 So that no one gets to know that inside they are watching a video or a Hindi film
 film khatm hui to seemaa ke pita ne unki ore dekha or gahari saans lete hue kaha, "yah role to hamaari seemaa hi kar sakati he
 "seema then breathed a sigh of relief
 unhone bataaya ki film bandit queen kii shooting ke dauraan do dinon tak unhone na kuch khaaya tha or na hi kuch piya tha
 Because Phoolan did something similar when she was living in the jungles
 unhone khud ko baaki samaaj se alag kar liya tha or dhaulpur ke ek guest house ke kone main baithkar ghanton tak apane kirdaar ke bare main sochati rahi thim

 He also said in gestures that "when the election date comes, understand" the battle has started and i want the people of the state to vote once again for those working "
 haalanki sulah kii sambhaavna ko lekar mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne sidhaa koi jawaab nahin diya
 Talking to the media, Akhilesh said that at least the people of the opposing party should tell their work
 loktantr main kam se kam akalan hota he or agar janata akalan karegi to samaajawaadee party ko dobaaraa satta main pahunchane kaa kaam karegi'
 On the issue of arrogance and compromise in the party, Akhilesh said that 'I understand that this is the time how socialist principles should move forward
 samaajawaadee vichaardhaara or kaise aage tak jaaen
 With the blessings of the socialists, i got an opportunity to work, perhaps it was his blessing that things could be done
 netaji ne hi kaha tha ki kya express-ve 23 maheene main ban saktaa he
 
 
 We made it in 23 months
 metro desh main kabhi itane kam vakt main nahin bani hogi
 That is why i am saying that in democracy, Netaji gave me a chance and with his blessings we have done so much work
 logon ko bharosa he ki samaajawaadee party kaam karegi
 That is why when we have given work, we have worked and now we also say that the work of socialists also speaks'
 tippaniyan He further said that 'today the socialists have done the most work in the state
 logon ne kaaphi sangharsh kar samaajawaadee vichaardhaara ko yahaan tak pahunchaaya he
 i will fulfill my responsibility
 kaam or netaji kaa aashirwad is pradesh main parivartan laaenge'
 Asked questions related to the reasons why the party has not yet reached a compromise, Akhilesh said that when it comes to taking decisions in politics, how is the future ahead, how is the future of the socialists better, i think he is more than the socialists Nobody knows better
 isliye aapke sawaal kaa jawaab isi main he ki samaajawaadee siddhant, samaajawaadee kaarykram or faisle jo aam janata, kisaan or majdoor ke liye hue hai, wo kaise aage badhen
 Therefore, the works which the socialists have done, they have landed on the ground '
 akhilesh ne media se baatcheet karte hue kaha ki 'kam se kam virdohi party ke log apana kaam to bataaen
 In democracy, there is at least an assessment and if the people assess, then the Samajwadi Party will work to restore power again
 party main ghamaasan or samjhaute ke mudde ko lekar akhilesh ne kaha ki 'main samajhataa hum ki yah samay aisa he ki samaajawaadee siddhant kaise aage badhen
 Socialist ideology and how to reach further
 samaajwaadiyon ke aashirwad se mujhe kaam karne kaa mauka mila, shaayad unheen kaa ashish tha ki kaam ho paae
 Netaji himself had asked whether the expressway could be built in 23 months
 
 
 hamane ise 23 maheene main hi banaakar dikhaa diya
 Metro will never be built in such a short time in the country
 isliye main kah rahaa hum ki loktantr main netaji ne mujhe mauka diya or unheen ke aashirwad se hamane itnaa kaam kiya he
 People are confident that the Samajwadi Party will work
 isliye jab kaam diya he, kaam kiya he or ab to ham bhi yah kehete hai ki samaajwaadiyon kaa kaam bhi bolta he'
 The comments unhone aage kaha ki 'aaj pradesh main sabase zyada kaam samaajwaadiyon ne kiya he
 People have brought the socialist ideology here by struggling a lot
 main apni jimmedaari ko nibhaaoongaa
 Kama and Netaji's blessings will bring change in this state '
 party main abhi tak samjhauta na ho paane kii vajahon se sambandhit sawaal puche jane par akhilesh ne kaha ki raajnneeti main jab faisle lene kii baat ho to aane vaala samay kaise acha ho, samaajwaadiyon kaa bhavishya kaise acha ho, main samajhataa hum vah samaajwaadiyon se zyada behatar koi bhi nahin jaanata he
 Therefore, the answer to your question is that how should socialist principles, socialist programs and decisions that have been made for the general public, farmers and laborers proceed
 isliye jo kaam samaajwaadiyon ne kiye hai, wo jameen par utaare hai'
 On the issue of arrogance and compromise in the party, Akhilesh said that 'I understand that this is the time how socialist principles should move forward

 Many people are proud of the success of the country in various fields and as a proof of this, they celebrate by comparing today with the time of independence
 lekin isamen khamiyaan nikaalane vaale bhi kam nahin hai
 The intoxication of those who sing the praises of India's development is such that they do not always mind the depreciating rupee and the recent slowdown in the economy
 unki najar main bharat naam ke bazaar kaa dabadabaa hameshaa kaayam rahegaa, simaaen gaayab hoti ja rahi hai or dakshin asia main sabase tikaoo loktantr hone kaa tamgaa bhi koi nahin chin saktaa
 By the way, all these arguments are not even absurd

 nehru kii vaigyanik soch ko aise samaajawaadee shashan kaa sahaara tha jisane saare sansaadhan vishaal sarkari kshetra ko khadaa karne main jhonk die
 It took more than four decades to break the comfort of socialism and change the habit of seeing the world through the prism of cold war, and some people in power had to act bravely

 In his words, "the criterion of achievements of high growth rate should be how the growth rate has affected people's lives and freedom
" ” sen kaa janaa-pahachaanaa tark haih vikaas=aazaadee=saamaajik nyaay
 The great development story of India, which is advocated by media and free market advocates, smells of bias, "the country is being told as if it is a California in the middle of the Sahara Desert

 Something terrible has happened in the last six decades of Indian democracy, because of which our record in the social field — healthcare or education or gender — is not good; We are also behind Bangladesh in terms of standard of living
 china se tulana hona to swaabhaavik he
 The People's Republic, despite being the world's superpower, is not really a republic of manpower; There is still inequality in this country and forgive the soul of Chairman Mao, China is no longer his countryside

 So what does it mean that democracy is a hindrance to the path of development? In the days of the rise of the so-called Mahabali economies of south-east Asia, this logic that has become fashionable, has thrown history on the garbage heap: if the growth of Western Europe or America is not the result of a liberal dictator, then North Korea or Cuba will not become another China
 Have found saamaajik buniyadi dhaancha khadaa karne main bharat kii asafalataa loktantr kii asafalataa nahin he
 This failure is due to politics, administration policies and priorities - we have failed to link growth with growth

 This outrage towards the affluent class may be on the left side, but the social truth of the story of India told in this book is so bitter that we have no complaints about it
 hamen fark is baat se padana chahie ki agar ek arthshaastri pradhanmantri kii sarkaar ne desh ke jivan ke das saal barbaad na kiye hote to shaayad yah pustak likhi hi na jaati
 Let's read the book excerpt: He did not become a country, whose dream was not to dismiss the saga of India's achievements, but is the story just this much? The bright picture of a nation moving rapidly towards development in its true sense does not present a comprehensive, or balanced blueprint of the ground reality
 yahaan kai khamiyaan hai—kuch to bahut badi hai—haalanki suvidha sampann varg, khaskar jashn manaane vaala media bhi akasar unhen nazarandaaj karnaa hi behatar samajhataa he
 We also have to clearly believe that not presenting these problems to the public or making them appear marginal can be very costly, because democratic reform mainly depends on the understanding of the public and the wider debate on those serious problems
 Those that need to be collided with and solved
 bharat ne haal ke samay main teji se aarthik vikaas kiya he jiskaa jashn akasar puure josh ke saath manaaya jaataa rahaa he, par is tathy par gaur karnaa bhi behad jaruri he ki bharat main hui aarthik pragati ne saamaajik sthitiyon par kuch khaas asar nahin daalaa
 In recent years, the distribution of income has not only resulted in inequality (this trend of India matches that of China), but also with the sharp increase in real wages in China, India's relatively stable real wages did not match
 duusari ahm baat yah he ki tej aarthik vikaas se ikattha hue sarkari paise ko saamaajik or bhautik buniyadi dhaanche kaa vistaar karne ke liye nirdhaarit or suniyojit tareeke se istemaal nahin kiya gaya (isamen bharat china se bahut peeche he)
 a large part of the population is still deprived of basic social services (from schooling and health care to providing clean water and drainage)
 jahaan bharat apni vaastavik aay ke sandarbh main anya deshon se aage nikal rahaa he, vahiin dakshin asian kshetra main hi inhen deshon se vah kai saamaajik sanketakon ke maamle main pichad rahaa he
 Though India's GDP is at par with China in terms of growth rate, it lags far behind China on indicators such as longevity, literacy, child malnutrition and maternal mortality
 dakshin asia main hi ek kamjor arthvyavastha vaala desh, bangladesh kai saamaajik sanketakon (life expectency, bacchon kaa tikaakaran, shishu mrityu dar, bacchon main alpaposhan or ladakiyon kii schuli shiksha) ke maamle main bharat se aage nikal gaya he
 Even Nepal, despite being just one-third of the GDP per capita, has come on par with India on many social indicators
 gaur talab he ki bees saal pehle sarvshereshth saamaajik sanketakon ke sandarbh main bharat chah dakshin asian deshon (bharat, pakistan, bangladesh, srilanka, nepal or bhutan) ke bich duusare paaydaan par tha
 At the same time, he is almost seen standing on the last step (at the lowest rung is the problematic Pakistan)
 bharat main prati vyakti aay upar ja rahi he, lekin saamaajik sanketak lagaataar neeche phisal rahe hai
 India's aim behind the freedom struggle was to achieve development and equality, but it has certainly failed in this case
 aarthik vikaas se paidaa aay kaa bantwaaraa hi asmaan nahin rahaa, balki nav nirmit sansadhano kaa bhi upyog is tarah nahin kiya gaya ki samaaj ke vanchit samoohon kii jaruraton kii purti kii ja sake
 The democratic powers instead of redressing the unjust conditions prevailing in present-day India turned in other directions

 The record of rapid economic growth in India in recent decades, especially in the last ten years, has been encouraging
 pichley dashak main ‘madhyam varg’ (yani aay ke anusaar aabaadi kaa sheersh 20 fisadi) kaa jivan str apeksha se kahin adhik behatar hua he
 But for many others such as rickshaw drivers, domestic workers or brick-kiln workers, the story is a bit complicated
 unke liye or un jaise vanchit samoohon ke liye aarthik sudhaar kaa yah daur zyada utsahjanak nahin tha
 It is not that nothing has improved in his life, but the pace of change has been very slow and there is hardly any change in his difficult situation

 In the period after the economic recovery, real agricultural wage growth declined drastically: in the 1980s it was at a rate of around 5 per cent per year, which fell to 2 per cent in the 1990s, and nearly zeroed in the 2000s
 
 2006 ke baad rashtriya gramin rojgaar guarantee adhinium (naregaa) ke amal main aane ke baad khaskar mahilaon ke sambandh main vaastavik krishi mazdooree main badhotaree hui
 Other units of the economy also experienced a relatively slow increase in real wages, especially for temporary or (so-called) 'unskilled' workers
 is sambandh main china ke saath tulana se mila nateeja kaaphi chankane vaala he
 According to international data from the International Labor Organization, China's construction sector saw an amazingly 12 percent increase in real wages in the first decade of this century, compared to around 2 per year in India
 5 pratishat darj hui
 The possibility of exaggerating China's official figures cannot be ruled out
 lekin swatantra taur par kiye gaye kai adhyayanon ne saaf pushti kii ki china main pichley 20 yaa 30 saalon main vaastavik mazdooree main teji se vruddhi hui he
 In contrast, the growth rate of real wages in India was much lower than per capita GDP in the same period
 ye tathy un logon ko hairaan kar denge jinhen sarkari anumaanon ke hawaale se garibon ke rahan-sahan kaa akalan karne kii aadat he
 For example, according to the Planning Commission, the rural poor 'population ratio' (the proportion of rural population below the poverty line) fell from around 50 per cent in 1993-94 to 34 per cent in 2009-10
 yah ek bade sudhaar ke jaisaa lagata he
 But this fact does not embrace the fact that how can the increase in actual per capita spending be so low? The truth is that many people are only partially below the government poverty line, so even a small increase in per capita spending is enough to 'cross' the poverty line
 india ke nakshe main bharat gaayababharat ke ‘vikaas maarg’ main kuch to khamiyaan hai
 This is indicated by the fact that despite performing well in terms of growth in per capita income, India is lagging behind other South Asian countries (with the exception of Pakistan) in terms of several social indicators
 acha he ki isaki shuruyaat bangladesh or bharat ke bich tulana se kii jaae
 India has become much richer than Bangladesh in the last nearly 20 years: India's per capita income was 60 per cent higher than Bangladesh in 1990 and was projected to double by 2011
 haalanki, isi avadhi ke dauraan, bangladesh life expentency, bacchon ke jinda rahane, tikaakaran main badhotaree, kam prajnan dar or kuch (sabhi nahin) schuli shiksha sanketakon sahit buniyadi saamaajik sanketakon kii ek lambii fehrist main bharat se aage nikal gaya—1990 main donon hi deshon main jinda rahane kii umr kamobesh ek-si thi
 But in 2010 it was estimated to be four years more in Bangladesh (65 and 69 years respectively) than India
 isi prakaar, 1990 main anumaan tha ki bangladesh main bal mrityu dar, jo ek dukhad sanketak he, bharat se 20 fisadi adhik he, lekin 2011 tak yah teji se girakar bharat kii tulana main 25 fisadi kam ho gai
 Despite being less than half of India's per capita income, Bangladesh is now better than India on most social indicators
 nepal kii kahani bhi kam dilachasp nahin
 Despite all the political and administrative problems, it is rapidly reaching the level of India and in some cases it is going ahead
 1990 ke dauraan nepal lagbhag har vikaas sanketakon par bharat se pichhadaa hua tha
 Today, despite the per capita income in India being three times higher than in Nepal, the social development indicators of the two countries show greater similarity (in some cases India is still better and in some cases the opposite)
 pakistan ke saath kii gai tulana main haalanki bharat kaa palada baari dikhataa he, lekin usase bahut khush hone kii jarurat nahin
 Between 1990 and 2011, real per capita income at stable prices in Pakistan increased by nearly 50 per cent and in India by 170 per cent
 lekin zyaadaatar maamalon main saamaajik sanketakon main buniyadi taur par koi antar nahin dikhaa (shuru main kuch maamle bharat ke paksh main rahe, lekin kuch pakistan ke paksh main)
 Other contexts such as immunization rates showed greater improvement in Pakistan than India
 prati vyakti aay ke sambandh main bharat kii rank main sudhaar aayaa he, yah chauthe (bhutan, pakistan or srilanka ke baad) se tisare paaydaan (bhutan or srilanka ke baad) par aa pahunchaa he
 India topped this group in rate of increase in per capita income (as with most groups of countries in the world)
 lekin adhikansh anya maamalon main bharat kii rank kaaphi neeche gir gai he
 In the 1990s, there was only one country in South Asia (sri Lanka) that had better social indicators than India, but today India has fallen below most countries and is above only one country - from Pakistan
 vikasmoolak adhyayanon main, khaskar bharat main, dakshin asia ke tulanaatmak nateezon kii aam taur par andekhi kar di jaati he
 Nevertheless, looking at all the dimensions of South Asia, we can get a chance to learn a lot
 udhaaharan ke liye, vikaas ke naam par bharat main schuli shiksha ke liye nijee kshetra ke istemaal kii vakaalat karne vaale visheshgyon ke liye yah jaananaa jaruri he ki saamaajik sanketakon khaskar schuli shiksha ke sandarbh main bharat se bahut aage khadey srilanka main kahin koi nijee skool nahin he or vahaan 1960 ke dashak se hi ise nishiddh kar diya gaya tha
 It is also worth noting that there are "few people in Sri Lanka whose distance from the residence to the nearest health center is 1"
 4 kimi se dur he
 “indian planners and the Indian public should take note of the many policies and achievements of neighboring countries
 bharat main jahaan dakshin asian tulanaaon par bilkul dhyaan nahin diya gaya, vahiin anya deshon kaa samooh aam taur par iskaa ‘mitra samooh’ mana gayaru brazil, rus, bharat or china (jinhen brick deshon ke rup main janaa jaataa he)
 These nations have some characteristics in common, such as their large population
 bharat khaas myanon main vastav main is samooh main apwaad he
 For example, in every country of this group, full literacy in under-age groups has been achieved or is about to take place
 lekin bharat ab bhi vikaas ke is buniyadi dhaanche ko puri tarah se majboot nahin kar paaya haih 2006 main 15-24 varsh ke aayu samooh ke sabhi bhartiya purushon kaa paanchvaan hissaa or usee samooh main mahilaon kaa chauthaa hissaa padhgaye or likhane main asamarth the
 Similarly, child immunization has been done in almost every BRIC country except India
 darasal ham pehle hi dekh chuke hai ki bharat ke tikaakaran kii dar bangladesh or nepal sahit anya dakshin asian deshon ke saath tulana main kaaphi kam he
 India is also very backward in relation to malnutrition among children
 anya brick deshon main is bhayanak samasya kaa nivaaran takreeban ho chukaa he
 But it still has its roots in India, where about 40% of all children under the age of five are below the expected weight according to age and even more proportion of such children (about 50%) are justified Physical development is not possible
 yah pattern kuch had tak yah tathy darshata he ki bharat ab bhi anya brick deshon kii tulana main bahut garib haih bharat kaa prati vyakti sakal gharelu utpaada (‘kray shakti samta’ ke liye samyojit) brazil kii tulana main ek-tihaai se or china se aadhe se or rus se ek-chauthai se kam he
 It is clear that a lot of work needs to be done to bridge this huge gap
 sirf prati vyakti aay ke sambandh main ‘barabari’ karne se safalataa nahin milane vaali
 The rapid development at the economic stage during the last 20 years in India did not achieve anything significant towards improving the catastrophic situation of child malnutrition or increasing child immunization rate
 isi tarah, maa-baap apane bacchon ko skool bhejne main sakasham ho jaaen, iske liye prati vyakti aay kii vruddhi ke liye intjaar karne kii bajaae har kisi kii sakshartaa ke liye tej or nirnaayak badlaav zyada jaruri he
 'equalization' is not only linked to per capita income, but more importantly, it also points towards public services, social cooperation and economic distribution
 padhai par pani pherane vaale schoolsarkaari skulon main padhai main aa rahi samasyaon ko dekhte hue yah samaj main aata he ki vishleshak kyon yah kehete hai ki shiksha kaa nijeekaran kar dena chahie
 But the question is, how practical is this perceived better option? Private schools offer options but such options, which in no way can play the role for which government schools are made and the role they have played to bring changes in education in most countries of the world
 ek badi samasya padhai kaa kharch sabake sadhano ke bheetar rakhane kii he kyonki fees kaa bahut bada hissaa privet skulon ke munaafe se judaa he
 This option does not allow children from poor families and disadvantaged communities in India to enroll in and study in school
 duusari baat yah he ki agar kharch kii samasya ko kisi tarah sulajh liya jaae (sahaytaprapt nijee skulon yaa sarkaar dwaara skool vauchar dene jaisi kisi vyavastha se) to bhi anya samasyaayein to rahati hai
 There are always limitations of information in school education, especially for parents of children going to school for the first time
 iske alaava skool adhikariyon yaa privet skool chalaane waalon ke paas chaatro ke mata-pita kii tulana main bahut-si aisi jaankaree bhi hoti he jo ve de sakate hai yaa dena chaahate hai
 This is not a suitable environment to implement the voucher system
 teesri baat he ki spardhaa na hone ke kaaran, jaisaa akasar bharat ke gaanvon main dekha jaataa he, privet skool bahut saadhaaran darje kii padhai ke badale moti rakam vasuulne kii mashin hokar rah jate hai
 The role of the competition to keep the market running in terms of school education cannot be ignored
 sirf skool chalaane ke liye maamuli fees lekar gaiyr-sarkari skulon kaa dayera badhaane ke anek sarthak prayaas ho rahe hai
 But the recent experiences of private schools in the field of education in India provide the perfect example of both dedicated success and money making machine
 unki yah aalochana akasar sahi sabit hoti he ki ve jo kuch kehete hai, use puraa nahin karte hai
 As stated earlier, the performance of private schools in India does not look better than the government schools in terms of average success of the students
 isse sanket miltaa he ki yahaan koi saral samaadhaan sulabh nahin he
 The indirect disadvantage of over-reliance on private schools is probably that they pull the children of parents from government schools who can make the most criticism and demands and who can make government schools most responsible and accountable
 privet skulon ke bharose rahane se sarkari skulon kii samasyaayein or bad sakati hai kyonki ve sarkari skulon main shiksha ke nimna str se trast adhik mukhar or adhik pariwaron ko bachane kaa rasta de dete hai
 Private schools are a part of the picture of school education in India, but the need to improve and trust government schools in a big way is not going to end simply because those who can afford, private school
 Option
 swasthya seva kaa dhakoslaswasthya kshetra ke us sankat se nikalne kaa rasta kya he jo aaj shaayad bharat ke samaane sabase badi chunauti he? chunautiyaan badi hai par unki vikaraalata se bhaybheet ho jane kii bajaae hamen is chunauti par kaabo paane ke tareeke or saadhan talash karne chahie
 For this, we should also look at the analysis of the factors contributing to this crisis and the closely related lessons that come from the experiences of other developing countries to better deal with these problems
 un bhartiya rajyon (khaskar tamilnadu or kerala) ke behatar pradarshan se seekhney ko bahut kuch he, jinhone shesh bharat kii tulana main apni janata ke swasthya kii bahut behatar dekhbhaal kii he
 As far as the rest of the world is concerned, China is the most important place in the countries that can give an immediate lesson to India, but countries like Brazil, Mexico and Thailand are also included in this list
 puure desh ke liye swasthya seva kii samgr sankalpana main sabake liye samaan suvidha ke sankalp kii mahatta ko samajhnaa shaayad sabase pehali or sabase ahm jarurat he
 Thailand, Brazil and Mexico have achieved this position in recent years and completely changed the nature of healthcare access to their public
 china kaa anubhav khaas taur par dilachasp he, kyonki usne 1979 main pehle-pahal ek baar to aarthik sudhaar ke sankalp kii aavashyaktaa ko hi nakaarne kii koshish kii or sabake liye samaan suvidha kii puraani parampara ko palat diya
 China paid a heavy price for this change in terms of longevity and general health
 aakhirkaar usne is inkaar main chhipi bhul ko samaj or 2004 se sabake liye samaan suvidha kaa sankalp phir teji se apanaaya (china 95 pratishat lakshya hasil kar chukaa he) or iskaa use phayda mila
 So-called fans of China often advocate that India follow China, although they do not know what China does
 china ne swasthya seva kaa prasar privet health insurance ke haath main nahin choda he
 The role of government in this is very big
 ye saare anubhav aarthik tark kii kasuti par hamaari apekshaaon ke puri tarah anuroop hai, khaskar (1) jan swasthya main nihit ‘sarvajan hitay’ kii bhaavana, (2) ekikrut soochna kii bhoomika, or (3) kisi samudaay yaa desh main swasthya kaa saamaanya str hasil karne par asamanta ke prabhaav ke kaaran
 In order to make healthcare accessible to all, major changes will have to be made in at least two aspects in the entire healthcare system of India
 sabase pehle to hamen is bhramjaal se baahar aana hoga ki bharat main kharaab swasthya se achche swasthya kii taraf badlaav nijee swasthya seva or insurance se aasaani se hasil kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki saare tathy is soch ke khilaaf hai
 In most healthcare systems around the world, there is scope for private services in some form and there is no reason for India to break this tradition
 bharat main swasthya kii yojana banaate samay javabdehi ke muddon or un anya chunautiyon ko andekha nahin kiya ja saktaa jo swasthya seva kii sarkari vyavastha sahit sarkari kshetra ke sanchaalan ko prabhavit karti hai
 Regardless of whether or not there is the ability to pay the price (which the Bhore Committee had years ago given as the basic principle of spreading healthcare to all), making health services accessible to all members of society and fulfilling other needs of good health is completely government Is the responsibility of
 iske alaava swasthya seva ke maamle main bazaar kii vyavastha or privet beemaa kii simaaon ko dekhte hue sabake liye swasthya seva sulabh karaane kaa lakshya hasil karne main swasthya sevaaon kii sarkari vyavastha kii buniyadi bhoomika he
 Subsequently, the other aspect that needs to be changed under the proposed policy in India lies in the need to re-adopt the basic rules in the government system of healthcare, prevention and treatment
 isamen praathmik swasthya kendron, gram str ke swasthya kaaryakartaaon, nivarak swasthya upayon or niyamit rup se samay par swasthya seva ke anya sadhano par nae sire se dhyaan dena aavashyak he
 The new National Health Insurance Scheme of Health insurance for poor families at a subsidized rate is a humanitarian program
 bimariyon ke ilaaj kii bajaae rokthaam ke prayaason main janabhagidaari kii aavashyaktaa khaas taur par bahut adhik he
 These include vaccination, sanitation, public hygiene, garbage disposal, disease surveillance, mosquito control, health education, food safety regulation and all public health related activities in technical language
 pir parvat-si he, pighasni chahieaaj ke bharat main shikayaton or virodh kii kami nahin he
 But it has to be known whether the screaming and politically powerful protests provide a fair glimpse of the evils and injustices that plague India's deprived population
 apekshaakrit sampann bhartiya jo bhale hi amir na hon par jinaki aamadani tathaa rahan-sahan kaa str aam bhartiya se upar he, unki rajnatik mahatta or takat vaastavik garibon ko die ja sakane vaale dhyaan ke raste main roda ban jaati he
 The result is often that in many political issues, the majority of India's most deprived people have almost no place
 suvidhavihin virgon ko is tarah baahar rakhe jane se lok niti main unke hiton kii hameshaa upeksha hoti rahi he
 The neglect of schooling, healthcare, social security and allied matters is one aspect of this pattern in India's plan
 sampann virgon ke hiton kii taraf lok niti kaa jhukaav kai rup le saktaa he
 This includes neglecting farming and rural development, promoting environmental plunder for private interests and looting government subsidies directly and indirectly on affluent classes
 yah bahuaiami asamanta use nirantar jari rakhane ke saadhan paidaa karti he or aisa khaas taur par vikrut saarvajanik bahes or media kawarej se hota he
 With such a large social divide there is a great disparity in the voice and strength of different groups
 iske alaava yah samaaj ke kamjor virgon kii vanchanaa kii bheeshan tasviir ko bhi vikrut media kawarej or saarvajanik bahes ke jariye chipa letaa he jo mul rup se us vishaal or jeevant jansankhya ke hiton kii poshak lagati he
 The curtain of darkness on the sufferings of the unaccounted and their deafness is so dense that the common man's expectation of immediate support from vocal leaders has got a new definition
 vaastavik amiron se kam sampann, par apekshaakrit sampann log akasar apane aap ko aam aadmi samajhane lagate hai
 They get the misconception that they are deprived parts of society and this can only be true when we compare them to the upper layer of the real rich
 east india company ke ek shuruaati adhikari jorge lindse jonstone ne 1801 main landan main sansad main bahut gahari baat kahi thi ki bharat main britain kaa samrajya soch kaa samrajya he or yah apni shakti ko pahchaanane se bharatvasiyon ke inkaar kii buniyaad par khadaa he
 The ignorance of common Indians in recognizing their strength was the main reason for India's slavery to continue in the British rule in the time of Johnstone
 kuch had tak bharat ke rajnatik halaat kii vajah se yah aaj bhi sach he ki suvidhavihin bhartiya jaagrit hone or khud ko is asaadhaaran vanchanaa se teji se or hameshaa ke liye mukt kiye jane kii maang karne main hichakate hai
 The complaints of the so-called common man, the most affluent, and yet relatively affluent, are strongly veiled
 iske vipareet bhartiya samaaj main vaastavik kamjor virgon kii lambey samay se jari jabardast vanchanaa par apekshaakrit kam dhyaan diya jaataa he
 Despite this, India's democratic politics gives the most disadvantaged countrymen an opportunity to recognize their power and demand that the most important inequalities that ruin the lives of such a vast population of the country be resolved at the earliest
 bhale hi yah kuch had tak rajnatik sanghathan kaa maamla he par bharat main vanchanaa or asamanta ke vistaar or vishisht prakruti ko saaf taur par samajhnaa bhi behad jaruri he
 This is a major challenge facing India today

 rahul gandhika achaanak sansad ke mahatvapurn satr ke dauraan videsh chale janaa lagbhag dedh sau saal puraani is party ke liye ek buree khabar he
 The leader who was expected to crown the party on his head and who would protect it from the shadow of bad days, went on his own leave
 lekin sach yah he ki rahul gandhi se aise kadam kii ummid nahin thi, yah kahana bhi galat hoga
 Rahul never showed full interest in the functioning of the party nor did he show his strength
 kai baar laga ki vah kisi krantikari kii tarah kai nae kaam karenge or party ko nai disha denge
 After the party's complete defeat, their expectations were raised
 lekin unhone kuch aisa nahin kiya yaa kaha jisase sochaa ja sake ki vah is moorchhit party ko phir se punerjeevit karenge
 His position in the party was strong, but after the defeat, the manner in which Sonia Gandhi's advisors did not let him run, it seemed that he was unhappy and wanted to change the party completely
 zaahir he isaki ijaajat unhen nahin mili
 There were two distinct factions in the party
 party ke khurraat or puraane netaa unki chalane nahin de rahe the
 Even before the election, many of his favorite characters were discharged from their posts
 rahul chaahate the ki party ko puri tarah se nayaa rup diya jaae or nae chehron ko jagah di jaae
 It seems that he did not listen to it
 aisa lagata he ki party adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne bhi unki baton ko maanane se inkaar kar diya kyonki unhen party main vidroh kaa khatra dikhaai de rahaa tha
 The battle of old versus new is not new in Congress
 rahul gandhi kii daadi indira gandhi ne bhi yah ladaai ladi thi or party main old guard kaa safaya kar diya tha
 The Old Guard, led by Nijalingappa and Kamaraj, then tied up Indira Gandhi, but she cleverly captured the party
 vah raajnneetik doordarshita or samaj kaa kamaal tha
 But Rahul does not seem to be in a position to do something like this
 vah udasin se rah rahe hai or party main jad se jud nahin paae
 Not only this, there is a whole army of sycophants around them which is not allowing them to work at their discretion
 unke saath aise log bhi hai jinaki raajnneeti mahaj apane ko upar sthapit karne kaa jariya he
 The list of such people is long and unfortunately Rahul is close to them
 inamen aise netaa badi taadaad main hai jo chunavi raajnneeti se dur rahe hai or bayanon kii raajnneeti bhar karte hai
 It is not that Sonia Gandhi does not have such people but Rahul has to get rid of such people
 unke ird-gird jo log hai unke boote to vah bharat kii raajnneeti main dhamaakedaar vaapasi kii ummid to nahi kar sakate hai
 However, the question now is how will the Congress show its attitude in this important session? Small parties are showing their presence in Parliament as an alternative to Congress
 dekhnaa he ki party ke karnadhaar ab kaise kadam uthaate hai

 shav ke pareekshan main unke sharir par nishaan mili hai jisase sanket miltaa he ki unhone sandigdh aatankwaadiyon kaa virodh kiya tha, jinhone unka apharan kiya

 They said that they could no longer bear the tragic loss of their sons
 chunaav parinaam ko aae kaafii din biit chuke hai lekin abhi bhi maharashtra main sarkaar banati nahin dikh rahi
 The reason for this is that Shiv Sena and BJP who contested the elections together and are now entangled
 mudda yah he ki shivasena is baat par ad gai he ki ek formula tay hua tha amit shah or uddhav thakare ke bich ki yadi shivasena or BJP kii sarkaar banati he to dhai saal shivasena or dhai saal BJP raaj karen
 Actually, Shiv Sena wants Aditya Thackeray, who is the son of Uddhav Thackeray and the first person in the Thackeray family who has contested elections, wants to make him Chief Minister but it has not been discussed yet
 aapako ye bhi bataa den ki 2014 main shivasena or BJP ne alag-alag chunaav ladaa tha
 However, many do not remember this
 duusari baat yah he ki pichley paanch saal sarkaar main rahete hue bhi shivasena ne ek tarah se vipaksh kii bhoomika nibhaai he
 The Shiv Sena has often targeted the BJP and the Modi government through its mouthpiece Saamna, while Sharad Pawar has been praised in the same face
 khaaskar chunaav ke baad pavaar ko badhai dene waalon main shivasena ke netaa kaafii aage rahe
 Sharad Pawar too has always had a good relationship with Bal Thackeray, which the Pawar family never hid
 to kya yah mana ja rahaa he ki ab aisi paristhiti main yadi pavaar shivasena ko samarthan dete hai to congress bhi majaburi main is gathbandhan ko samarthan karegi bhale hi wo is gathbandhan kaa hissaa ho yaa naa ho
 This is being said that Congress leader and former Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan has given its message
 NCP ke nawab malik or prafull patel kaa ravaiya bhi shivasena ke prati naram he
 Sanjay met Raut Pawar when Shiv Sena leaders went to meet the Governor
 zaahir he 2 raajnneetik netaa jab aapas main milte hai to raajnneeti kii hi baaten hoti hai
 It is also being said that if Shiv Sena retreats now, it will suffer political damage, its image will be affected that Shiv Sena does not do anything but only threatens
 uske daant keval dikhaane ke hai
 If the Shiv Sena wants to become a model, it will have to come out of the shadow of the BJP, according to big people
 bahut log aisa maanate hai ki aise halaat main yadi NCP or shivasena saath aate hai to unke paas 110 kaa aankada hoga jabaki bahumat ke liye unhen 127 vidhayak chahie kyonki congress voting se gaiyrhaazir rahegi iske liye 13 vidhayak or chahie jabaki nirdaleey or choti partiyon ke vidhayakon kii sankhya 27 he
 So can Pawar do something like this? All the people who know Pawar believe that it is possible
 ek duusare vikalp kii bhi charchaa kii ja rahi he ki kya BJP or NCP saath aa sakate hai? kai log ye maanate hai ki aisa bhi ho saktaa he
 The reason for this is ED, the Enforcement Directorate which is behind Sharad Pawar, Ajit Pawar and Praful Patel
 to kya usase bachane ke liye pavaar BJP kaa daaman tham sakate hai?raajnneeti main kuch bhi ho saktaa he lekin sabase badi baat ye he ki akhir bijepi 50-50 ke formule se kyon batch rahi he, yani dhai saal BJP raaj kare or dhai saal shivasena
 This is because all such experiments have failed in history
 uttar pradesh main mayawati or kalyaan singh kii sarkaar bhi nahin chali, karnataka main kumaraswami or congress kii sarkaar nahin chali or haal hi main kashmir main mahabuuba mufti or BJP kii sarkaar nahin chali
 Is this the reason the BJP wants to avoid the 50-50 formula with the Shiv Sena
 kair jo bhi ho lekin maharashtra ke logon ne ek nai sarkaar chuni he or unhen haq he ki ek sarkaar bane jo unke liye kaam karnaa shuru kare kyonki maharashtra ke kai hisson main abhi bhi bahut tej barish ho rahi he or logon kii haalat karaab he
 This time is not for politics
 shivasena or BJP ko aapas main baithkar apane jhagade suljhaana chahie
 Otherwise, as Supriya Sule, daughter of Sharad Pawar and also an MP from Baramati, said that if BJP and Shiv Sena do not do their work, then we have to do something for the public interest
 unka ishaara saafe he or sabhi maharashtra ke raajnneetik dalon ko yah ishaara samaj janaa chahie
 The foundation stone ceremony of one thousand classrooms was organized in Delhi's government schools on Saturday in the capital

 Promising the people of Delhi, he said that you are requested to give 67 of the 70 seats to the AAP in the last assembly election
 usee tarah is loksabhaa chunaav main 7 siton bhi jitwa dena
 Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodiane present in the program said that Delhi Government will create 12 thousand 748 rooms this year, while the work of building 11000 classrooms is starting from today
 saath hi upmukhyamantri ne daawa kiya ki dilli main skool or pul khub ban rahe hai kyonki ab eemaandaaree se kaam ho rahaa he
 In 4 years, 8 thousand classrooms and 25 schools have been built
 aage 31 skool banaae ja rahe hai
 Manish Sisodia said to the children who came to the program to go home and say thank you to the parents because they chose the Aam Aadmi Party, made Arvind Kejriwal as the Chief Minister and me the Education Minister (here in a hurry Sisodia called himself 'chief Minister', then Made corrections immediately
 )aage unhone kaha ki desh main mandir-masjid kii raajnneeti ho rahi he or dilli main skool banane kii
 If we do not link politics with education, then we will make these schools cook
 arvind kejariwal kaa saath dena jaruri he, ham nahin rahe yaa kamjor pad gaye to skulon main padhai kii jagah shaadiyaan karwaai jaaengi
 He promised that i will build such schools as if i am getting my house built

" sach, is film ke liye main itani mar rahi thi ki maine shahid par yah dabaav banaaya ki vah mujhe vishaal se milawaayen

 mujhe aaj bhi yaad he audishan ke dauraan vishaal sar ne mujhase kaha tha ki vah mujhe bahut stress denevaale hai or maine khushi-khushi unki sari baaten manzur kar lee thim
 If Shraddha is to be believed, Vishal's obsession with this film had increased so much that she could remember Shakespeare's entire play for it, but Vishal advised her not to do anything like this, relieving him

 vastav main ek baar ko to saaf lagane laga tha ki team india apane vanade itihaas kaa sabase bada kalank jhelane ja rahi he
 But former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, with the help of Kuldeep Yadav, saved Team India from not only the biggest, but a total of 'four big embarrassments'
 bhale hi dharmashala main team india bada score banane main naakaam rahi, lekin in chaar badi sharmindagiyon sein batch paanaa karodon bhartiya cricketpremiyon ke liye ek badi raahat lekar aayaa
 The comments aapako bataa den ki team india ko apni sabase badi sharmindagi saurav ganguli kii captaini main jhelni padi thi
 Then on 29 October 2000, the Indian team landed at the Sharjah ground against Sri Lanka
 srilanka ne pehle ballebaaji karte hue 50 overon main 299 ran banaae the jisamen salaami aatishi ballebaaj jayasoorya ne 189 ran kii pari kheli thi
 Indian team 26 in response
 3 overon main 54 ran par hi dher ho gai thi
 Robin Singh had scored the most 11 runs

 Then on 8 January 1981, the Indian team was piled up in 63 odis against Australia in Sydney
 lekin dhoni or kuldeep yadav ne bharat ko is duusari badi sharmindagi se bhi bachaa liya
 Despite this, the risk of suffering two more embarrassments still remained equal on Rohit's men
 in sharmindagiyon kaa khatra tab or bad gaya, jab kuldeep yadav bhi 19 ran banaakar 70 ke yoga par hi out ho gaye

 They will need a simple majority in Parliament to get it passed

 Johnson continued, "we have a new (brexit) deal now and there is also a big opportunity for voters to pass it so that we can create a new Parliament instead of a useless Parliament that can implement Brexit
" ' isse pehle pradhanmantri boris johnson ne kaha tha ki iyu ke saath unka samjhauta desh ko thik kar saktaa he

 Hi
 
 
 aaj release hui 'department' kii kahani police kii aisi team par aadhaarit he, jo anderworld ke ek gang ke safaye ke liye duusare gang kaa istemaal karti he, lekin aisa karte-karte team khud hi anderworld kaa mohara banane lagati he
 
 
 Sanjay Dutt and Rana Daggubatti are members of this team
 
 
 concept acha he, lekin film main 70 se 80 pratishat sirf khoonkhraba he
 
 
 We kept searching for the story amidst the fierce action filmed on small and unique songs
 
 
 or phir aayaa, amitabh bachchan kii varsh 1982 main release hui film 'namakhalaal' ke hit geet 'thodi si jo pi lee he
 
 
 a remake of 'sanjay Dutt is dancing in a nightclub
 
 
 amitabh ke is behtareen gane kii durgati unheen kii ek or film main dekhnaa bardaasht nahin hua
 
 
 Yes, Nathalia Kaur definitely did a good item number to look at, but the pen of those who wrote her writing got pity
 
 
 lagata he, jab-jab diarector ramgopal verma ne ection diarector ko pani pine kaa brake diya hoga, film ection se kamedi banati chali gai
 
 
 Of course, unknowingly
 
 
 camera ghoomane laga - pistaul, coffee mag, juute, chashme, jeens, chaay kii kettle or kairam board ke striker ke saath
 
 
 The comments gangster se netaa bane saraji raav, yani amitabh bachchan haath par ghanti baandhte hai, kyonki jab-jab ghanti bajati he, unhen desh kaa dushman yaad aa jaataa he
 He resolves the feud between the two Gutka King brothers by giving them brand names like Sheela Mix and Sheela Remix
 
 
 vijay raaj or unki gang main shaamil ladi gangster bani madhushaalini ne to kamedi kaa bavaal kar diya he, lekin yahaan bhi, anjaane main
 
 
 Some action scenes, including an encounter in a bustling market, are definitely impactful, but 'department' in totality is a very boring and confusing film
 
 
 'ramgopal verma kii aag' dekhte vakt man main ek jigyaasa to thi ki vah 'sholay' kaa kitna bura haal kar sakate hai, lekin 'department' dekhte vakt to yah ummid bhi saath nahin thi
 
 
 Our rating for this film is 1 star

 India and Japan agreed on Tuesday to increase bilateral defense and security cooperation
 ek aadhikarik bayaan main bataaya gaya he ki donon desh samudri suraksha ke kshetra main bhi ek-duusare ko sahyog karenge
 In a meeting between India's Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar and Japan's Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, the two countries decided to hold talks at various levels after a regular interval
 isamen donon deshon ke raksha mantriyon kii vaarshik yatraaen bhi shaamil hongi
 The statement said that Kishida stressed similar strategic interests between India and Japan and conveyed to Tokyo the desire of India to enhance bilateral defense and security cooperation, including in the field of maritime security
 raksha mantri kaa padbhaar sanbhaalane ke baad se parrikar kii yah pehali videsh yatra he
 This is seen as an effort to combine the strengths of the two countries to counter China's growing influence in the region
 kishida ne kaha ki japan bharat ke saath aarthik sahyog or kshetreey sampark badhaane ke liye sanyukt rup se kaam karnaa pasand karegaa
 The Defense Minister of Japan will visit India in 2016
 parrikar ne dwipaksheeya rishton ko majboot karne ke liye japan kii pahal kaa swaagat kiya or kaha ki japan raksha upkarnon or praudyogiki ke kshetra main bharat kii 'mek in india' pahal kaa ek visheshadhikrut saathi he
 Parrikar is on a four-day trip to Japan
 somvaar ko unhone japan main apane samakaksh general nakaatni se mulaakaat kii thi
 - Input IANS ‘hindi hitarakshak samiti’ ke sansthaapak sadasyon main se ek tathaa uttarakhand sarkaar ke purv vishesh karyaadhikari shiv shashaank chandrashekhar upaadhyaay ne daawa kiya he ki yogaguru baba ramdev kii desh main hindi andolan ke bare main jaankaree adhuri he or unhen puri jaankaree ke baad hi is mudde ko uthaanaa chaiye or iskaa raajnneetik laabh uthaane kii koshish nahin kerani chaiye
 Upadhyay has said in a letter to Baba Ramdev that it is unfortunate that even after the examination and studies have been ordered through Hindi medium in nearly 30 higher subjects, Ramdev's platform demanded Hindi medium for these subjects
 Is going unhone likhaa he ki isse lagata he ki jin logon ne apane khun paseene se us samay andolan chalaakar hindi ko ek mukaam tak pahunchaaya tha unke is andolan kii andekhi kii ja rahi he
 Upadhyaya has written that Baba Ramdev has a special responsibility to strengthen the success of the anonymous agitators about Hindi who have already achieved success, rather than trying to gain political advantage about it so that the country Hindi can be given more importance
 unhone bataaya ki aaj se kareeb 20 varsh purv jab hindi andolan kiya gaya tha to us lambey andolan ke baad desh main ejineering, chikitsa vigyaan, vidhi, amed tathaa emb (prabandhan) tathaa kuch anya ucch paathyakramon me hindi bhashaa ko pehali baar vaikalpik madhyam banaaya gaya tha
 He said that government orders have also been issued in this regard and many people have given examinations in Hindi
 upaadhyaay ne apane patr main kaha ki kam se kam baba ramdev ke andolan se aisi ummid nahin kii ja rahi thi ki jin hindiviron ne is desh main hindi ko lekar itihaas rachaa he, unki ek suyojit raajnneeti ke tahat andekhi kar di jaayegi or hakeekat ko dabaa diya jaayegaa
 He said that it would have been good that in this Hindi campaign, Baba Ramdev would have gained full knowledge of these movements and raised his voice about the work that has remained incomplete in this direction, but Baba did not do so
 upaadhyaay ne kaha ki gumnami ke andhere main duube hindiviron ke jakhmon ko kuredne ke bajaay ramdev ko apane andolan main hindi kii pratishtha ko or adhik badhaaye jane ke bare main shankhanaad karnaa chaiye tha
 He has written in a letter reminding Baba Ramdev, 'I personally contacted your ashram in Kankhal, Haridwar about seven years ago and gave full information about the Hindi movement and requested that the work be incomplete
 Have gone that needs to be completed
 ’upaadhyaay ne kaha ki baba ramdev ke saath jo log hindi bhashaa ke pakshdhar hai unhen acchhee tarah se puri jaankaree hasil karne ke baad hi, jo kaary abhi tak adhuraa rah gaya he, use puraa karne ke bare main aawaaj uthaane ke liye rachanaatmak kaary karnaa chaiye
 He advised Baba Ramdev to avoid such people and said that sincere efforts should be made to further enhance the prestige of Hindi and not to raise voice only to loot political motives or accolades
 upaadhyaay ne baba ramdev ko hindi andolan ke bare main vishesh rup se jaankaree dete huye kaha ki tatkaaleen hindi andolan main mukesh jain, dow
 Munishwar, Pushpendra Chauhan, Bhanu Pratap Singh, Vinod Gautam, Ajay Malik, Shyamaruddha Pathak and many other warriors even put their lives at stake
 unhone bataaya ki pushpendra chouhan to sansad main darshak ddeergha se kud gayi the or unki pasaliyaan tak tut gayi thim
 He also fasted for several days in front of Shastri Bhavan in Delhi
 upaadhyaay ne apane patr main likhaa he ki varsh 1980 main uttarakhand ke rudki se hindi kaa ugr andolan shuru hua tha or varsh 2009 tak sthiti yah bani he ki desh kii sirf nau vishesh parikshaon ko chhodkar shesh main hindi bhashaa se bhi pariksha di ja sakati he, aisa aadesh ho chukaa he
 Even now Combined Military Examination (CDS) can be given in Hindi
 unhone kaha ki aamtaur par hindi kaa andolan sahitya se shuru hokar vyakaran or uccharan ke raste gujarata hua puraskaar kii haveli par samaapt hota rahaa he
 He said that such alleged agitators have nothing to do with the plight of Hindi
 'kabiraa khadaa bazaar main maange sabaki khayr, naa kahu se dosti naa kahu se bair
 'kabir had said this long ago in Doha Banaras market
 lekin tab unhen shaayad kii yah andaja ho ki ab usee banaras main wo vakt bhi aayega, jab ganga kii lehren bhi siyasat ke bazaar main hichkole khaane lagengi
 Those who are saying that this time the road to Delhi is going to go through Benaras
 lihaaja sunne waalon ne banaras ko hi gherne kii taiyaari kar lee he or usee taiyaari kii pehali seedhi bane hai bahubali mukhtaar ansaari
 Say Banaras, Varanasi or Kashi
 par ye vahi he jahaan kabir ne bazaar main khadaa hokar majahab par haaavee rasmon-rivaaj or paramparaon ke khilaaf aawaaj buland kii thi
 Against the evils of caste and religion, the weak were shown the path through their couplets
 ab usee banaras main wo vakt bhi aayega ki ganga kii lehren siyasat ke bazaar ke damakham par khadi khud hi apni ek nai lahar ko hairat se dekhakar hairaan ho jaaengi
 Ganga, Dharma, Politics and Delhi have taken the 16th Lok Sabha Angry and all the people who will do it in Banaras are now focused on it
 jaahir he aise main banaras ke liye dalon main apadhapi sabase tej he
 But restlessness is most in the BJP, because its prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi wants to go to Delhi only through the city of Shiva
 jabaki baaki saare dal kisi bhi tarah modi kaa rasta kaatane main jute gaye hai
 lahim-shaheem Bahubali Makhtar Ansari, who is more than seven feet high, has no refusal to taste the election juice of Banaras
 iske peeche ek puri gahari soch he
 The thinking that was started to implement the exercise on the same day the Sivaganga Express caught the road to Benaras with AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal
 darasal 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mukhtaar ansaari kaa report card dekhte hue modi virdohi dalon ko ye ahsaas ho chukaa tha ki agar mukhtaar is baar chunaav naa laden to tay he ki banaras ke musalamaanon kaa vot ekamusth kejariwal kii jholii main janaa tay he
 If this happens, Kejriwal can repeat the same charisma he did in New Delhi
 kahaan fansaa siyaasi penchvarsh 2009 main mukhtaar ansaari ne bispi ke tikat par varanasi se loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladaa tha
 In front of him was bjp's stalwart Murali Manohar Joshi
 us chunaav main mukhtaar ansaari sirf 17 hazaar 87 voton se haare the
 Murali Manohar Joshi had received 2 lakh 3 thousand 122 votes while Mukhtar Ansari had received one lakh 85 thousand 911 votes
 local vidhayak ajay raay jo is baar banaras se congress ke ummidavaar hai 2009 main samaajawaadee party kii tikat par lade the or ek lakh 23 hajaar 874 vot lekar tisare number par rahe the
 That is, if we combine the votes of Ajay Rai and Makhtar Ansari, then Murali Manohar Joshi would have been behind by nearly one lakh votes
 or bas yahi wo cheez he jise modi virdohi dal is baar ke chunaav main bhunaanaa chaahate hai
 And the most important role in this is that of Mukhtar Ansari
 upi main mau ke maujuuda vidhayak mukhtaar ansaari 4 baar se mau se hi vidhansabha kaa record chunaav jeet chuke hai
 That too with heavy votes
 banaras or aasapaas ke puure ilaake main mukhtaar ansaari kaa jabardast bolbalaa bhi he par aisa nahi hai ki mukhtaar ke inkaar ke saath hi banaras kaa suspence khatm ho gaya
 Now it will take a few more days
 vaise bhi jaldi nahin he, kyonki banaras main chunaav sabase aakhir main yani 12 may ko he
 As of now, your leader and your team are yet to camp in Benares
 abhi shuru hoga chunavi kheljaahir he kaashi main asli chunavi khel aap ke deraa daalane ke baad shuru hoga
 Sports to unite Muslim voters of Benaras in the name of Modi
 taaki unka vot congress, bispi yaa espi main naa bate
 The atmosphere should be such that the Muslim voters of Banaras can be convinced that if someone can stop Modi in Kashi, then he is just Kejriwal
 mukhtaar kaa banaras se chunaav naa ladane kaa elaan usee koshish kii pehali jeet he
 For Narendra Modi, the center of Hindutva, Varanasi's seat is not just a seat
 varanasi purvanchal kaa dil to he hi hindutv kii cendrabhumi bhi he
 There are 23 Lok Sabha seats in Purvanchal and it is believed that Modi's candidature from Varanasi may give a boost to bjp's claim on all 23 seats
 bijepi kii chunavi ranneeti philhal jabardast dikh rahi he, lekin party ko ab ye dar daraa rahi he ki mukhtaar ansaari kaa ye master stroke kahin bana banaaya khel na bigaad de
 Actually, the effect of the Fernas of Banaras is that politics here also holds the finger of culture
 ganga kii laharon kii tarah hi yahaan raajnneeti bhi kal-kal karti pal-pal badalati he
 But this change is always the result of a new hope in the system
 modi or kejariwal kii daudwaise siyaasi chaal bhale hi baranas ke votaron ko baat de, lekin is nagari kii ek-duusare par nirbharta se hindu-musalmaan donon ke bich ek aisa taana-bana banataa he jo kabir kii jhini-jhini chadariyaa tak ja pahunchataa he
 This is the reason why even in the rocky valley of haters, the blooming of the rose of love has still not stopped
 alabatta ganga kinare is majboot taane-bane ke rahete hue bhi ek sawaal is shahar main jarur gum rahaa he ki aakhir narendra modi ne varanasi ko hi kyon chunaa? or kejariwal unke peeche-peeche yahaan kyon chale aae?sawaal ye bhi he ki jo log banaras main siyasat kaa sitara chamakaane aae hai kya kaashi unke raajnneetik bhagya kaa suraj chamakane degi? agar unki khoj kuch or hoti wo shanti kii talash main aate, man ko shant karne aate to baat samaj main aati
 But if their quest is for supremacy, where will they get peace from? That's why Kabir said standing in the market of Benares
 
 
 moko kahaan dhunde re bande main to tore paas rena main deval naa main masajid, naa kaabe kailash menna to cono kriya karm main naa hi yoga veraan menkhoj hove to turant milihe pal bhar kii talash menyah vahi banaras he jahaan ganga se sirf hindu kaa hi taalluk nahin he, balki muslmaan kaa bhi bada majboot rishta he
 He wears it with water
 ganga uske liye bhi jindagi kaa paigaam laati he

 dilli ke aijiai airport se builder or kaarobaari monti chaddha ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 In fact, he is accused of cheating on flat boys
 aaropee ke khilaaf pehle hi luk out circular jari ho chukaa tha
 a fraud case has been registered against Wave Group CEO Manpreet Singh Chadha aka Monty Chadha
 aarope he ki manpreet singh chaddha urf monti ne niveshkon se NH24 par sthit ek hitech township pariyojna main metro train, helipad jaisi suvidhaon ke alaava anya suvidhaayen dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 But none of these promises were fulfilled
 isliye monti ke khilaaf saal 2018 main niveshkon ke saath 100 karod rupee se adhik kii dhokhadhadi karne ke aarope main exiaar darj kii gai thi
 As a matter of financial offense, a look-out-circular was issued against Monty Chadha last year as a precaution
 monti ko avrajan adhikariyon ne us vakt airport se giraftaar kar liya, jab vah buudhvaar kii raat phuket jane ke liye vahaan pahunche the
 He was later handed over to the Delhi Police
 ab manpreet singh chaddha urf monti chaddha ko saket court main magistrate ke saamne pesh kiya jayega
 Now Delhi Police will seek his remand, but it will be interesting to see what the court thinks about this
 is giraftaar ke saath hi ek sawaal bhi uth rahaa he ki agar manpreet singh chaddha urf monti chaddha ke khilaaf thos maamla tha, to use aaj tak giraftaar kyon nahin kiya gaya
 He was not an absconding accused
 luk-out-paripatr yani loc matlab he ki jiske khilaaf wo ho, vah vyakti desh kii seemaa ke paar nahin ja saktaa
 An arrest can be made in this case when the accused is absconding or there is strong evidence against him
 ab yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki yah maamla court ke saamne kaise rakhaa jayega

 This is the 'conscience' period of Indian politics
 yahaan antaratma kii aawaaj par sarkarein badal jaati hai, to netaa-vidhayak palati maar jate hai
 It is the wonder of BJP that the MLA of the other party votes the party in power on the conscience
 is daur-e-siyasat main nishchit taur par antaratma, party, vichaardhaara par baari najar aati he
 'conscience converted votes' The fresh matter is that of UP, where votes are being cast for the Rajya Sabha elections
 bijepi ne apane 9wein ummidavaar ko jitaane ke liye bispi or sapa ke voton main send laga di he
 BSP MLA Anil Singh also reached the meeting of Chief Minister Yogi on Thursday night
 shuukravaar kii subah jab anil singh voting ke liye upi vidhansabha ke tilak haal pahunche to antaratma kii duhai dete hue bijepi ko vot dene kii baat kii
 The victory in the Rajya Sabha has been credible after the defeat in the by-elections for the ruling BJP in the state
 lihaaja bhagava party ne iske liye parde ke peeche se edi chotii kaa jor laga diya
 In this effort, he dedicated the game of conscience to the legislators of opposition parties to vote in favor of their candidates
 anil singh ne rajyasabha chunaav main matdaan karne se pehle apni 'antaratma kii aawaaj' kii baat kahi or bole, 'main antaratma kii aawaaj par vot daaloongaa, maharajaji (yogi adityanath) ko vot duungaa
 On the 'voice of conscience' of the unique 'anil' who took a turn in the spring season, the Deputy Chief Minister of the state, Keshav Prasad Maurya said that if anyone votes on the voice of the conscience, it is welcome
 jab in netaaon ke liye sarvopari hui antaratmadesh kii raajnneeti main 'antaratma kii aawaaj' par sabase bada faisla pichley saal hua tha
 In July of 2017, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar resigned from his post
 istipha dene ke baad unhone ise 'antaratma kii aawaaj' ke aadhaar par liya gaya faisla bataaya tha
 At that time, Nitish was running the government in Bihar with the RJD and the Congress, but behind the curtain, he broke this alliance after colluding with the BJP and formed a new government with the BJP within 24 hours
 unhone kaha tha, 'maine apni antaratma kii aawaaj par istipha de diya
 i saw that there is no way, then hello
 laga ki kaam nahin kar sakate hai to khud ko satta se alag kar liya
 i have resigned
 aage kya hoga, kab hoga, kaisaa hoga
 Leave it all to the future
 'kuch hi ghante ke andar hi nitish ne bijepi ke saath milakar nai sarkaar bana lee
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted and congratulated Bihar on coming up with development
 isi 'antaratma kii aawaaj' ke naam par bihar main jamkar raajnneeti kii jaati rahi
 After ruling together for 20 months, many RJD leaders continue to question the government in the name of this voice
 anya dalon kii anrtatmapichley saal june main raashtrapati chunaav ke dauraan 'antaratma kii aawaaj' kii baat us samay uthi thi jab upie kii ore se raashtrapati pad kii ummidavaar mira kumaar ne apane paksh main vot daalane ke liye nirvaachak mandal se 'antaratma kii aawaaj' sunne kii apil kii thi
 In a letter written to all the electorates, he said that the electorate has a chance to create history and forget all the differences and decide by listening to the 'voice of conscience'
 lekin unki apil kaa unhen koi khaas phayda nahin hua or endie ummidavaar ramnath kovind chunaav jeet gaye
 Sonia had left the PM post, however, on the same 'voice of conscience', in 2004, Congress President Sonia Gandhi decided not to become Prime Minister
 2003 main kai rajyon main congress kii karaari haar ke baad 2004 main aam chunaav main unki aguwai main upie ko bahumat mila to unhone 'antaratma kii aawaaj' kaa hawala dekar pradhanmantri kaa pad sweekaar karne se vinamrata se tab manaa kar diya tha
 He had said, 'it is not my goal to get the post of Prime Minister
 main hameshaa sochati thi ki yadi kabhi main aisi sthiti main ai jaisi aaj he, main apni 'antaratma kii aawaaj' sunuungi
 i politely refuse to take the position
 'baharhaal, rajyasabha chunaavon main kai baar vidhayakon ko 'antaratma kii aawaaj' par vot daalane kii chhot di jaati he, lekin isse pehle log apane nafe-nuksaan kaa aankalan bhi jarur karte hai

 jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay (jeenyu) main kathith rup se desh virdohi naare lagane ke maamle main dilli sarkaar ne shuukravaar ko patiala house court main kaha ki 2016 jeenyu rajdroh maamle main police ne gopneey tareeke se or jaldbaaji main aaropapatr daakhil kiya he
 It will take more than a month for the government to take a decision on granting permission to prosecute others including Kanhaiya Kumar
 dilli sarkaar ne mukhya metropolitan magistrate deepak shahravat kii court main aarope lagaaya ki police ne sakasham adhikari se anumati liye bagaiyr behad jaldbaaji main or gupachup tareeke se chargeshit daakhil kii he
 The court had earlier directed the state government to file an appropriate reply with a clear deadline regarding granting permission to prosecute
 is maamle kii agali sunwaayee 8 april ko honi tay hui he
 The Delhi government said in Patiala House Court, 'the decision on the charge sheet will be taken within a month of getting the advice of the Standing Council
 is maamle par abhi dilli sarkaar kii senior standing council kii salaah nahin lee gai he jiskaa intjaar he
 'JNU sedition case: Delhi Govt replies in Patiala House Court,' Decision on chargesheet will be taken within one month after opinion is received from the standing counsel
 Opinion awaited from the senior standing counsel of the Delhi government
 'next date of hearing is April 8
 https: / / t

 JNU sedition case: Delhi Govt replies in Patiala House Court, 'police has filed chargesheet in a secret and hasty manner without obtaining approval of the appropriate authority
 Department has not yet determined whether the alleged slogans raised were seditious or not
 '— ANI (@ani)april 5, 2019dilli police ne kathith narebaaji ke is maamle main 3 saal baad janvari maheene main chargeshit daakhil kii thi
 The Delhi government has not yet put forward its stand on the matter

 ab is maamle par koi nirnay tabhi aa saktaa he jab dilli sarkaar kii senior standing council bhi apana paksh rakhe
 (with PTI and ANI input) yah nari or purush ko unke apane drushtikon se dekhne kaa adbhut kathanak he, jisamen koi upar nahin or koi neeche nahin, balki sristi ke srijan prakriya kaa aisa ang he, jo uske sanchaalan ke liye aavashyak he
 Vishnu Prabhakar in his magnum opus 'ardhanarishwar' has given such a system of mindset of woman and man at different levels of individual, social and inner, which is different from all social system
 'ardhnarishwar' upanyaas nar or nari ke ekamek sur or swar-milan kii prapti kaa prayaas he
 Same caste, caste and religion problem, same marriage, divorce, rape problem, same women-exploitation, oppression, same shattering life story, but there is no 'waiting' for liberation
 yahan lekhak ne samaadhaan ke rup main ek vrihattar ruparekha kii sarjana kii he
 As in our mythological narrative as well, 'ardhanarishwar' is meant to achieve equal participation of female and male
 iske liye jaruri he, ek-duusare ko apni-apni durbalataaon va sabaltaaon ke saath sweekaar karnaa tathaa maan lenaa ki rachana ke liye prakruti va purush kaa milan bhi jaruri he
 The basic problem is that of a man, his masculine ego, which makes him 'poor'
 sahaj to ise hi bananaa he
 Due to this discomfort, the woman broke many bonds and came forward
 lekin bandhanheen hokar kisi uchhrunkhalata kii rachana karnaa lekhak kaa abhipret nahin he, balki bandhanon kii jakadan ko samaapt kar prayek sur ko uskaa yathochit sthaan dekar jivan-raag kaa nirmaan karnaa he
 In Ajit's words the author says: "I will free Sumita from my bondage
" main uski daastaa se mukt ho jaaounga
 Only then will we truly be husband and wife
 
 
 
 "this is the name of freedom from one's own slavery," Ardhanarishwar "
 sahitya ajtak ke pathakon ke liye maanav man ke adbhut shilpi vishnu prabhakar ke upanyaas 'ardhnarishwar' kaa yah ansh prakaashak 'kitabgar' ke saujany sepustak anshah 'ardhnarishwar'khand ekvyakti-mansumitaghanti par ghantiper haath rakhane se purv main kai kshan sochati khadi rahi
 How burdensome those cold moments were that i became sweaty
 
 
 
 Should i return from here and make an excuse over the phone? i know that all this will be in vain because then the smoke and bitterness will be rotating in the interiors

 While giving pain to myself, i am so tired that i want liberation and salvation is in exposing myself
 kiye-anakiye karmon ke dand se kab tak koi bhaagta rahegaa ? shabd andar rahete hai to saalte hai, mukt ho jate hai to sahitya ban jate hai
 Why are we surrounded by what we have not seen? Why hide what is experienced?

 Today i have come here determined to do the same
 apane ko khol dena chaahati hoon
 i want to throw off the sheet of smoke of the rituals
 lekin antar main umadta tumulanaad har kshan mujhe kaatar-se-kaatar kyon kar jaataa he ? kyon bhare rahete hai har roj dainik patr balaatkaar kii sharmnaak ghatnaon se, kyon buddhijivi har kshan bahes karte hai, is shabd ko lekar ? desh kii sansad main bhi goonjataa rahata he yahi ek shabd baar-baar, par kahin kuch hota kyon nahin ? shabd, shabd or shabd
 Has the existence of the word become meaningful without action? Perhaps it is not that by reading these embarrassing incidents, we have an exciting feeling in place of pain, 'I wish we had not been in the posture

 That day, he patted me with love like always

 Played for long with water and with her body

 After a long time, came out in the dormitory chanting that the scourge and the head shook

 My head hit at the bedside
 duusare hi kshan haath main churi liye vah meri chaati par tha
 His wrathful form, the dripping eye, the smoke filled my eyes, the bitter smoke accumulated
 
 
 meri chikhen usee dhuen main jam gayi
 
 
 
 ’’unke mastak par boonden chamak ai thim
 Don't know where the eyes were looking, as if there was no one there, just the eerie echoes of the bestial process that we both were living equally
 vah jeena bhi kisi yatnaa thi ! kai kshan baad vah phir boleen
 What pain was there then in his speech, "I remember so much that i could not save myself even after having a deep wound in my hand
 main ab bhi thik-thik nahin jaanati, vah kaise hua ? main to girte hi sangya kho chuki thi
 Whatever struggle i must have done, i must have done it in awe

 "who is worried about the neighborhood in big cities? And we were new
 phir bhi ek bahan ne meri cheekh suni, lekin jab tak ve kuch karne kaa nirnay le paatin darinda apana kaam kar chukaa tha
 It was only after her husband's arrival that my life survived
 kya arth tha unke bachane yaa na batch sakane kaa ?’’‘‘aisa kahengi ab bhi ?’’ main phir vichlit hokar bol uthi
 He looked at me restlessly
 tivrata se kuch kahana chaha, par utani hi tivrata se chup bhi ho gayi
 Seeing how hard they had to work for that unspeakable silence
 maine marm par chot kar di thi unke
 The same question was troubling me
 vahi prashn mujhe un tak khinch laayaa tha, phir bhi maine dhire se kaha, ‘‘kshamaa kar dijiye
 i hurt you ’’apane ko sahej-samet chuki thim ve
 First the tenderness on the face returned
 boleen dhire-dhire, ‘‘nahin beti, tumne koi pidaa nahin pahunchaai mujhe
 We give ourselves pain, by asking ourselves the same question
 kyon puuchhati hai ham yah prashn ? kyon hamen chintaa rahati he ki koi hamen hikaarat kii nigaah se to nahin dekh rahaa ? main apni baat kahati hoon
 Sister's husband immediately called my husband
 jab tak ve pahunche mujhe hosh aa chukaa tha
 i was sobbing with self-guilt
 maine unhen dekha to meraa band tut gaya
 Don't know, in the hope of gaining trust or for fear of losing
 ve ek shabd nahin bole
 Embracing, kept stroking for a long time
 maine saahas karke karun-kaatar drushti se unki aankhon main jhaankaa
 Fought his hand to bring it to the lips, then the dam broke
 main phir sisak uthi
 He bent over me, put his lips on my burning lips, saying, 'pummy! You just do not worry
 tumhaara koi aparaadh nahin he
 i am that poor

 "she said," i was getting shocked by seeing his courage

 "I suddenly gave them," then you must have gone to court and

 This could have happened
 ’’‘‘sochati hoon, yah na hota to kya main vakil kii jirah ko sah paati ? mere pati ne meri is yatnaa kii kalpana kii or maun ho gaye
 i remember they were very suffering, but as our society, we have sanskars, what else could have happened in it? He said after several days, how is our morality! Such a heinous crime against humanity remained without being punished due to this pseudo morality
 koun todega naitikta ke is aatmghaatee chakravyuuh ko
 
 
 
 ?’’‘‘aapke pati kya baad main bhi is prasang kii charchaa karte rahe hai ?’’‘‘nahin, kabhi nahin ! unhone mujhe usee raat vishwaas dilaayaa tha, ‘pampi ! tum nirdosh ho, pavitra ho

 But he has never denied his assurance till date
 ’’‘‘or aapane ?’’prashn sunakar meri ore dekhati rah gayi ve
 Just like you are trying to avoid it, but as the sand slips from under the feet, the moment of escape is lost
 meri aankhon main jhaankati ve boleen, ‘‘sach sumita ! sab kuch ke baavjood main vah nahin rahi thi jo snanaghar se nikalate samay thi
 The policy-ethics of society, the interpretation of sin and virtue in the scriptures, the relationship of male-female, all together, in my conscience had established the feeling that something unforeseen has happened and all that has happened is a sin
 aisa paap jiskaa pratikaar nahin ho saktaa
 i was not made guilty by that crime but by my society
 bheetar se main jise sweekaar nahin kar saki thi, vahi mujh par thope diya gaya
 He was punished for which the crime was committed

 That is why even after getting the free affection of husband and family, i still feel like everyone is watching me with the eyes of Hikrat

 She was saying, "when the layers of the mind are beginning to open, then i will not hide anything
" unase bhi nahin chipa saki thi
 Not even wanted
 kai din unhone mujhase kuch nahin chaha
 He kept on trying to reassure me
 meraa apana man to jaise purush ke prati apaar ghrinaa se umad-umad padataa
 If his eyes were closed, he too would be anxious to remove them beyond himself
 cheekh uthne ko hoti ki ankhen khul jaatin or main apad-mastak kaanp-kaanp uthati
 They would ask, "what happened, Pammi?" "I shouted unknowingly," You are a man

 "they would take me closer to themselves and i would wake up and hide my face in their chest," forgive me
 saaf kar do mujhe

 ‘‘pampi !’ ek din unhone mujh se kaha, ‘kab tak karti rahogi apane se nafrat ? kab tak detii rahogi apane ko yatnaa ?’‘‘kya karuun main, bataao main kya karuun ?’‘‘mere bare main socho, sab samaj jaaogi
 What did he say? The sky of my space was filled with lightness

 ‘‘lekin ve to or bhi kuch kah rahe the, ‘baat antatah tum par he, tumhaari apni shakti or tumhaari apni kshamta par he

 Don't know what she said to him in that emotional state
 itnaa hi yaad rah gaya he maine kaha tha, ‘kitna dar rahi thi main ab tak
 As countless Hinsa animals surround me, to take my sack, but now, now i am completely peaceful, i am relaxed

 "at that moment, his face was tortured by a torture, but he was astonished, but when i surprised myself, i asked," Why did you seek this protection from them, why didn't you seek it from within yourself? " Hearing this, she started looking at me stunned

 The ages has bygone in those tragic moments
 swasth huin to boleen, ‘‘lakhon-lakhon baar yahi prashn maine bhi poocha he apane se
 But daughter, where was the independent existence of the woman in the generation i belong to? Yes, sometimes imagination flashed in the brain and we used to feel satisfied that we would not be right, we or the women of our next generation would not wander out to get that protection

 Not dependent on each other
 ’’is baar stabdh hone kii baari meri thi
 Surprise, this generation could think to this extent! Then as someone has warned - if you can not think, why would you be so anxious and anxious to come out? i did not know where i had reached
 sahasaa lauti to ve kah rahi thim, ‘‘unka sahyog paakar meraa praytn yahi rahaa ki vah smriti mere maanas se mit jaae, par bhucamp se koi kaise bhaag saktaa he ? shuru-shuru main to mujhe unke prem ke prati bhi sandeh hone lagata tha, par jaisaa ki unhone sujhaayaa tha, maine apane se hi ladanaa shuru kar diya, chot khai, ladkadai bhi, par samooh se tut kar vyakti banane kii meri cheshtaa main unka bharpoor sahyog mila, ve kehete, ‘vyakti main kshamta va saahas hoga tabhi to samaaj shakti paa sakegaa,’‘‘ek or laabh mila is sangharsh kaa, main unase ekaakaar hoti chali gai, unamem kho rahane kii kaamana phir sahaj ho ai, jab maine janaa ki main maan banane vaali hoon to main jaise aashwast ho gai ki mere pati kaa pyaar pyaar he, karunaa nahin, betaa god main aayaa to parivaar kii vyastata main meraa antar ek naye anirvachaneey sukh kii anubhuti se bhar uthaa
 a year later the daughter also came
 tab samay hi nahin miltaa tha sochane ke liye
 Sometimes he would sarcastically say, 'now you are mother, not my wife
 meri chintaa kyon karogi
 
 
 ? "" Dhat, "I would have put the daughter in her lap and pressed her shoulder, but i don't know when and the seven moments of happiness ripped through that dreadful moment in my brain and i flashed
 
 
 ’’ve ekaek chup ho gayi
 They were not looking at me
 maine paaya, unka sir sofe par tik gaya he or ve kahin bahut dur pahunch gai hai, jahaan koi kisi ke astitv kii chintaa nahin karata
 i too had reached the great moment at that moment because i had spread the same situation within myself, but i did not want to let them feel
 isliye maine unhen apane-aap se jujhane diya or ankhen moond leen
 Someone would have seen the third, as if two suffering souls who were immersed in the tranquil ocean of pain, forgot to flap their wings and became stable
 
 
 lekin jis aakasmikta se ve chup ho gai thim, usee aakasmikta se mujhe stabdh karti ve bol uthin, ‘‘main tumhen ek baat bataati hoon, 
 
 
 "she fell silent again
" maine poocha, ‘‘aap kuch kah rahi thim
 "" Yes, what happened suddenly one day! My daughter was seventeen years old then it is a matter of time
 usne mujhase puch liya, ‘‘maan, tumhen kabhi apane jivan main aisa kuch sahanaa padaa he jo koi nari nahin sahanaa chaahati ?’‘‘ek kshan ko laga jaise teevr bhucamp kaa jhatka hamase takaraa kar nikal gaya he, par duusare hi kshan main sanbhal gai
 i looked at my husband
 drushti mili
 At that moment, we decided not to hide anything
 meraa betaa bhi vahiin tha
 My husband slowly told everything in a very moderate voice
 puri kahani sunne tak donon bacchon ne drushti nahin uthaai
 My husband became silent even though he did not react suddenly
 kai kshan lage apane ko sahejane main
 He stunned for a few moments, realizing the agony of the ages for me
 kaise ho jate hai ve kshan jivit, jo ateet ban chuke hai ! jivan kabhi usee rup main nahin lautataa par samay vaise-kaa-vaisaa aa khadaa hota he saamne
 Time does not die, it just passes
 
 
 ‘‘main na jane kahan pahunch gai thi ki maine anubhav kiya meri beti kii sukomal par swasth bhujaayen mujhe aalingan main band kar jaise apane main samet lenaa chaahati hon
 He kept his face next to mine
 boli maan kii pyaar se pagi vaani main, ‘maan ! tumhaara to isamen koi aparaadh nahin he
 Do not ever blame yourself
 ’‘‘meraa betaa kinchit aavesh main aa gaya tha, bol uthaa, ‘sab kuch badalanaa hoga; saare samaaj kii maansikta ko badalanaa hoga
 Surrounded by husband and children, i was proud to be my lady that day
 pulak-pulak uthi us kshan main
 i wiped my eyes after looking at the husband
 jo apane the ve mujhe hikaarat kii nigaah se nahin dekhte, us aashwaasan se bada sukh or kya ho saktaa he ! uske baad phir kisi ne us ghatana kii charchaa nahin kii
 Till date ’’‘‘lekin, aapke bheetar vah ghatana aaj bhi jivit he
 Don't believe in forgetting, perhaps? "" That belief is not obedient to us or not to do it
 ’’‘‘haan, hota to aap apane se hikaarat kyon karti hotin ?’’main jaanati thi ki main anjaane main krur ho uthi hoon, par shaayad vah hona anivaary tha
 So he looked away for a moment, then said, "I know daughter! what do you want to say
 vah thik bhi he
 
 
 Why did society have such a mentality, what is sacrament? Don't these values make us guilty in our eyes? But as i said, my son or should i say that the generation after me does not say about liberation from these rituals? "" But what could be liberated? i belong to that generation
 ’’vah kahana chaahati thim ki chaah uthi he to mukti kyon na milegi, par meri duusari baat sunakar thithak gayi
 He said, "you
" 
 
 tum kya kahana chaahati ho ?’’‘‘yahi ki mere saath bhi kuch aisa hi hua he
 Something different from this
 aisa kuch jis par aap bhi vishwaas nahin karnaa chahengi
 "suddenly a cold wave has run again in the atmosphere
" jaise samandar kii ashaant laharon main duubati-utarati naav kinare kaa abhas paakar phir majdhaar main bhatak jaae
 His terrible eyes met my eyes as if you ask
 
 
 tum
 
 
 What also
 
 
 ?maine turant udhar se drushti ghuma lee
 The frostbite inside me was hurting me and a meteor was blossoming in my sky
 mujhe apane ko sahejane ke liye ji-tod koshish kerani padi
 To take time, i asked a pointless question, "can you think that i will do anything by hiding from them now?" They know everything
 ’’main sahasaa kuch na kah saki
 He paused for a moment and asked, "you were talking about yourself, didn't you?" isiilie to yah bhoomika baandhi thi
 If i give permission, i will come tomorrow
 ’’unhone ghadi kii ore dekha, ‘‘haan, chaar baj gaye hai
 Did not realize

 Go and drink and come tomorrow

 Senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi has asked Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to resign the resignation of Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav in a corruption case, citing the example of the resignation of ministers in the past

 Sushil, who was the deputy chief minister in Nitish Kumar's cabinet during the NDA rule in Bihar, referred to Nitish's resignation taken at different times due to different criminal charges leveled against four cabinet members Jitan Ram Manjhi, Ramanand Singh, Awadhesh Kushwaha and Ramadhar Singh
 That he ever said that he would not tolerate any 'tainted' in the Cabinet

 yah adhikarrajasav guptchar nideshaalay(diarai) or pravartan nideshaalay (idi) ko bhi praapt he
 CBDT comes under the Ministry of Finance
 vidambnaa yah he ki 12 november, 2005 ko chidambaram ne vitt mantri ke pad par rahete hue rajasav sachiv ke
 M
 chandrashekhar (ab cabinet sachiv) kii 9 november, 2005 kii ek file noting par karrwai kii thi
 It was urged that the tapping of phones be handed over to CBDT in place of Central Bureau of Economic Intelligence (CEIB)
 nigaraanee rakhane or telephone kii baatcheet bich main sunne ke sibiditi ke adhikaar ko kya chidambaram or chandrashekhar ''nihit korporate swaarthon'' ke dabaav main jaanboojhkar khatm karnaa chaahate hai?sibiditi or dukhi iees lobby, jo sabase zyada pareshaani mahasoos kar rahi he, kaa aisa hi daawa he
 Chandrasekhar's note- (F: 286 / 117 / 2005 IT (INV2) - clearly stated that "to prevent tax evasion and identify tax evaders; to curb black money and implement National Common Minimum Program policies" Involvement of CBDT is necessary as black money is closely related to terrorism and other mafia activities, its job is to gather intelligence and share it with investigative agencies
 jaisaa ki grih mantralay ne sujhav diya he, main sifarish karata hum, ham apane pehle ke prastaav main sanshodhan karke kendriya aarthik guptchar beuro ke badale iskar vibhaag kii jaanch shakha ko un agenciyon kii suchi main jod sakate hai jinhen telephone par hone vaali baatcheet kii nigaraanee rakhane kaa adhikaar he
 After Chidambaram's approval, the then Home Minister Shivraj Patil gave his consent on 21 December 2005
 patil dwaara niyantrit grih mantralay ke patr main kaha gaya ki ''is mudde par grih mantri kii sahmati he
 The CBDT investigative branch will seek approval from the Ministry of Home Affairs before the telephone is intercepted
 '' yah 2006 se aise hi kaam karti aa rahi he
 On November 17, 2005, Chandrasekhar, the then Home Secretary V
P
 ke
 Writing a letter to Duggal clarified about giving the CBDT the right of tapping: "these measures will increase the government's ability to collect information
 iskar vibhaag kii jaanch shakha agrani bhoomika nibhaayegi or samanaantar arthvyavastha se nibatane main aage rahegi
 It is important that black money is eradicated before it is created and to handle the business of making it white, this task should be entrusted to CBDT in place of Central Bureau of Economic Intelligence
 ''chidambaram or chandrashekhar kii bhoomika main aae badlaav se koi kya andaja laga saktaa he? apane shuruaati avtaron main, ve is baat ke sabase bade himachati the ki phone tanping kaa adhikaar sibiditi ko diya jaae
 Probably the truth is that the post of Chandrasekhar as Cabinet Secretary is under the CBDT investigation itself
 aay se adhik sampatti rakhane kii baat kii jaae to madhya pradesh ke iees dampati arvind or tinu joshi kaa naam aata he jinke paas 360 karod ru

 And many documents were found regarding Joshi's alleged unaccounted investments
 vibhaag ne daawa kiya ki 67 lakh ru

 The raid was killed after receiving complaints that the officer had allegedly invested heavily in an insurance company
 ek anya maamla grih mantralay ke nideshak ravi inder singh kaa tha, ek iees adhikari jise khufia agenciyon ne rashtriya suraksha ke saath samajhaita karte hue dastavejon kii supplai main bhoomika nibhaane ke aarope main giraftaar kiya tha
 Recently, Vijay Shankar Pandey, Principal Secretary to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati, was removed on charges of alleged liaison with Hassan Ali Khan in the matter of making black money white
 pichley dinon prashasnic adhikariyon ke bhrasht hone kii anek ghatnaayen saamne ai hai
 In many cases, CBDT has been at the forefront of intercepting telephone conversations to catch criminals
 cabinet sachiv ko ye baat kuch jami nahin he jabaki grih mantri vitt mantri ke saath takaraav main shaamil hai
 The government wants to make the regulations on authorized phone tapping more stringent
 sibiditi ke sutron ne india today ko bataaya ki grih mantralay korporate swaarthon ke dabaav main jhuk rahaa he
 a committee led by Chandrasekhar recommended that CBDT be removed from the list of phone tapping agencies
 lekin chintit pradhanmantri karyaalay ne chidambaram se kaha he ki ve is maamle par antim faisla karne se pehle mukherjee se salaah kar len
 What is the interest of the corporate that it wants to deprive CBDT of phone tapping rights? The simple reason is that corporates themselves are the target
 sibiditi dwaara phone tanping kii jaanch se jabardastsboot mili hai
 Keeping in mind the leakage of Niira Radia tapes, an inter-ministerial group is preparing to tighten the process of phone tapping
 sibiditi sutron ne chetavanee di he ki agar phone tap karne kaa adhikaar waapas le liya gaya to kar dene waalon kii sankhya teji se kam ho jaaegi
 Refusing to reveal his identity, a source said, "tax revenue is Rs 450,000 crore
 he
 When we know something is being hidden, we can catch big fish without any difficulty
 jin logon par hamen shaq he unke phone tap karne or baatcheet par nigaraanee rakhane kii khuli chhot mili to hamaara kaam aasaan hoga

 unhone kaha ki main abhi bhi apane bayaan par kaayam hum
 However, Antulay is not ready to disclose whether he has written a letter to the Prime Minister or not
 antule ke mutabik naa to wo isaki pushti kar rahe hai or naa hi isse inkaar kar rahe hai
 Antulay says that he is a party soldier and has always worked for the party, so whatever he wants to ask, ask the party itself
 antule ke mutabik party kaa faisla antim hoga, or pad yaa kursi kaa unke liye koi matlab nahin he
 There are also reports that the party may take a decision in Antulay's case by this evening

 In his letter to the Prime Minister, Antulay has written that if the party has to face embarrassment due to his statement, then he is ready to send his resignation

 The results of Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh assembly elections 2017 are coming
 donon hi rajyon main counting jari he
 The BJP seems to get a clear majority in both the states
 gujarat main bijepi kii jeet tay ho gai he or himachal pradesh main bhi camel khilanaa tay ho gaya he
 It is clear from the data so far related to the counting of votes that independents and NOTA (none of them) played in the results of this Gujarat election

 ajab haalat he ki jo vyakti sarkaar main khabaron ke liye jimmedaar tha, use khud apni chuttee hone kii khabar nahin thi
 The decision to remove Harish Khare from the post of media advisor to the Prime Minister was taken six months ago
 sarkaar ke vichaaron ko janata main pahunchane main unki naakaami se congress netritv khafa tha
 But on January 19, when Pankaj Pachauri was appointed as Communications Advisor i
e
 Communication Advisor, Khare did not understand the matter
 shaayad unhone yah sochaa ho ki chunki unka darja secretary str kaa he or pachori ko edisnal secretary ke str par rakhaa gaya he, to pachori unheen ke maatahat kaam karenge
 Khare eventually resigned after he was told that Pachauri would report directly to Principal Secretary Pulak Chatterjee
 nai kaman shrinkhalaa main khare ke liye koi jagah nahin thi
 According to a cabinet minister, Khare had sought help from Ahmed Patel, Sonia Gandhi's political secretary
 haalanki yah spasht nahin he ki patel ne unase kya kaha, lekin 10 janpath se unhen ek sandesh jarur mila
 They were told that if they leave quietly, they might get something in lieu of it
 thik vaise hi jaise atal bihari vaajapeyi ke purv media salaahkaar ech
 K
 dua ko pad sanbhaalane ke do saal baad 2001 main jab pradhanmantri karyaalay se baahar kiya gaya, to iske aivaj main do saal baad unhen denmark main bharat kaa rajdoot bana diya gaya tha
 Khare's hatred towards the media is evident
 times naao televijan channel ke pradhan sampadak arnab goswami ko unhone jis tarah jhdika tha, vah desh bhar kii media par sidhaa prasaarit hua tha
 On 16 February 2011, Khare had a meeting with the Prime Minister and the TV editors
 jab goswami ne ek ke baad doosraa sawaal kiya, to khare ne unhen yah kehete hue chup kar diya ki ''yahaan pradhanmantri se jirah nahin chal rahi he
 Before this, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who was facing all the questions directly, suddenly started to look as if he was trying to hide something
 print media ke patrakaron kii to or bhi jabardast malamat hoti thi
 Criticism of the Prime Minister was sometimes ignored, but as a punishment for criticizing the Prime Minister's Media Advisor, journalists were only evicted from the PMO
 yah baat ahm he ki pachori chatarji ko report karenge, na ki pradhanmantri ko, jaisaa ki kaayda rahaa he
 Chatterjee is known for his closeness to Sonia and Rahul Gandhi and his presence in the Prime Minister's Office is seen as an increasing hold of 10 Janpath on South Block
 upie ke pehle kaarykaal main, jab manmohan ne apane mitra ke bete sanjay baru ko apane media salaahkaar ke taur par chunaa tha, to unhen sirf ek kaam saunpa gaya tha
 Baru says that "I had asked the Prime Minister what his hopes were with me, he had said that i want you to be my eyes and ears
" bina bhay yaa pakshpaat ke mujhe vah bataao, jo tumhaari samaj se mere liye jaananaa jaruri ho
 "now Pachauri will do the same work, but not for the Prime Minister, but for Chatterjee
" televijan sampadak rahe pachori se ummid he ki ve electronic media kii pal-pal kii jaruraton ko khare kii tulana main kahin behatar dhang se samajhenge
 "the role of media consultant varies from time to time," says Baru
 ech
 Yi sharada prasad (indira gandhi ke media salaahkaar) ne ek baar mujhe bataaya tha ki unka vaasta paanch sampadakon se padataa tha jabaki main 300 tivi channel or akhabaaron se vaasta rakhata tha
 "the prime objective is that the Prime Minister be in the discussion
" khare ke nizaam main pradhanmantri karyaalay chuppi kaa shikaar ho gaya, jisase yah sandesh ja rahaa tha ki manmohan kuch nahin karte
 The first thing Pachauri has done is to bring the Prime Minister's Office on Twitter
 kanoon mantri salmaan khurshid sweekaar karte hai ki sarkaar ne soshal media ko prabhavi dhang se istemaal nahin kiya he
 Pachauri's first tweet was a meeting of officials of the Prime Minister's Office of the National Skill Development Council
 ek or twit main pachori likhte hai, ''desh ke kuch sabase bahadur bacchon se mulaakaat kaa intjaar he
 He was always seen sitting on elephants in the Republic Day parade
 ''pachori apane purvavartiyon jitne varisht nahin hai
 According to Atal Bihari Vajpayee's press adviser, former journalist Ashok Tandon, "this may increase the importance of the Press Information Bureau (PIB)
" '' aise main, pachori ko soochna prasaaran mantri ambika soni ke saath talmail rakhkar kaam karnaa hoga
 Khare also annoyed the cheerful mood Soni
 unhone televijan sampadakon ke saath press conference main shaamil hone ke liye pehle soni ko nimantran diya or phir waapas le liya tha
 According to a Congress general secretary, the Minister of Information and Broadcasting was told that there was "not enough space" in the room to be accommodated
 rajnatik taur par chatur soni ne apni jagah khud bana lee
 a few months later, in May 2011, he persuaded the Prime Minister to set up a group of ministers to handle the media
 press salaahkaar ke kaamon kaa ahm hissaa hota he-media main pradhanmantri kaa prachaar karnaa
 Tandon says, "getting the chance to meet the prime minister is the most important
 ham videsh yatraaon par saath jane ke liye sampadakon ko protsaahit karte the
 Each person in the aircraft had a chance to interact with the Prime Minister for half an hour
 isamen ve jo chahen baatcheet kar sakate the
 "he smiles stating that" In some cases, the editors even lobbied for the Rajya Sabha seat
 '' tandon kuch logon kii tulana main is lihaaj se bhaagyashaalee the ki vaajapeyi media ke pasandida the
 Dua h
 di
 Dev Gowda was also a media consultant
 ve yah yaad karte hue feeki-si hansi hansate hai ki jab tatkaaleen pradhanmantriji-15 kii baithak main haraare kii yatra par gaye the or saath main apane 15 rishtedaaron ko le gaye the, tab press ne is jatthe ko ''gauda kaa ji-15'' kaha tha
 Dua asks, "how will you refine the image of a man who snores in Vigyan Bhavan in front of cameras?" Manmohan's advisors have to strike a balance between the two centers of power - 10 Janpath and 7 Race Course Road
 sugabugahat yah he ki khare ke laptop kii haal main hui chori kaa mul makasad tha unki mail ko hack karke congress ke netaaon ke bare main unke vichaaron ko jaananaa
 If that was the case, there was no need for the thief to suffer so much
 khare ne sonia ke prati apni naapsandgi ko kabhi nahin chipaaya
 On September 6, 2000, Khare made fun of The Hindu in The Hindu, saying that "the batch of praises that reached 10 Janpath to congratulate Sonia Gandhi on becoming a nanny were led by Manmohan Singh
" '' sitambar, 2010 main, pustak vimochan ke ek kaarykram main, khare ne kaha, ''congress yathasthitivaadee party he
 It does not believe in any theory
 ''harish khare ke trek record ko dekhte hue, pachori kaa ek saadhaaran-sa twit media tak pahunchane kii drushti se chamatkaar mana jayega

 What if you know that someone has sacrificed 56 years of his life to take care of his love
 ji haa, ye sach he or ye misaal kaayam kii he china ke ek 84 saal ke vyakti ne, jinka naam he du yuanpha

 mahaj 20 saal kii umr main unki patni ke puure sharir ko lakva maar gaya tha
 Diyuanfa has been taking care of his wife for so many years, but he did not take care of Jou as well, so he left his job
 purvi china ke sunajiau main rahane vaale du yuanpha ne patni ko lakva maarane ke kuch himaheenon baad1959 main bataur kol miner apni naukari chhod di thi
 The wedding took place only a few months ago, when the couple was paralyzed, they were married five months before that
 yuanpha paas ke shahar taian main koyale kii khadaan main kaam kar rahe the or vahiin unhen ek chitthee mili ki unki patni kii tabiyat thik nahin he or wo bistar se uth nahin paa rahi hai

 Even today, if someone tells them the Ayurvedic recipe for curing his wife's illness, then they go out to explore herbs in the Yuanfa mountains
 wo jadi-bootiyon ko ubalkar pehle khud chakhte hai, taaki wo jahrili na nikle or puri tarah se santusht hone ke baad hi jou ko khilaate hai
 Helping the neighbors, from administration to administration, has affected their neighbors so much that everyone is ahead to help them

 vah puberty (rajaswala hone) kii umr paa chuki he or apni vaivaahik jindagi jeene ko aaazaad he
 a girl from Uttar Pradesh has approached the court to declare her marriage valid before the constitutional age of marriage is 18 years, on the grounds that 16 years of age is considered to be eligible for marriage by a girl from Islamic law
 So he has the right to marry
 HC ke faisle ko supreme court main chunautiyuvati kii ore se elahabaad hai court ke faisle ko supreme court main chunauti di gai
 The High Court had ordered the woman to be sent to the shelter home, terming her marriage void
 faisle ke khilaaf supreme court main daayar yachika main kaha gaya he ki vah shaadishuda he
 In such a situation, he should be allowed to live a married life
 yah maamla uttar pradesh ke ayodhya kaa he
 The bench of Supreme Court Justices NV Ramana, Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice Ajay Rastogi, while hearing the application filed in the case, agreed to hear it in detail and issued a notice to the UP government seeking an answer as to why the petitioner should not Be allowed jabaki hai court ne shaadi ko shunya qaraar de diya he
 The lower court sent the shelter home after the girl's age was 16 years at the time of the marriage
 The trial court of Ayodhya, during the hearing of the case, ordered that since the girl is a minor, she should be sent to the shelter home
 ladki ne elahabaad hai court main arji daakhil kar nichali adaalat ke faisle ko chunauti di
 But the High Court also upheld the lower court's decision that since the petitioner is a minor girl and does not want to live with her parents, the order to send her to the shelter home is correct
 is aadesh ke saath hi hai court ne shaadi ko shunya qaraar de diya
 In her petition against the order of the competent court to marry a man of choice, the woman argued in the Supreme Court that under Islamic law, any girl is usually 16 years of age, that is, she will decide her life when she is menstruating Is independent, that is, he is able to marry anyone he likes

 HC had rejected the petition on the husband's petition, the girl's husband filed a habeas corpus petition before the Lucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court, the bench rejected the petition of the girl's husband saying that the Juvenile Justice (care and Protection) Act Under the girl, she will be considered a minor
 lihaaja yah shaadi amaanya he
 The High Court agreed to the decision of the lower court and sent the girl to the Woman Shelter Home
 ab supreme court is vivaad ko nae nazariye se sunegaa, yani muslim aabaadi ke liye desh kaa kanoon or islamic kanoon main se koun sa kab, kahaan or kaise lagu hoga yah bhi saaf ho jayega
 The Government of Pakistan made it clear on Monday that official policy was not presented through the announcement of a reward of one million dollars on the head of the person making the anti-islam film
 haalanki, yah nahin bataaya gaya he ki yah elaan karne vaale mantri ke khilaaf koi karrwai kii jaaegi yaa nahin
 State Department spokesman Muazzam Khan said that Railway Minister Ghulam Ahmad Bilour's declaration against the person making the anti-islam film was his personal view and it has nothing to do with the official policy of the Government of Pakistan
 khan ne ek sankshipt bayaan main kaha, ‘‘bilaur kaa bayaan aadhikarik niti ko prastut nahin karata he
 However, the statement did not say whether any action would be taken against Bilour? He appealed to the Taliban and Al Qaeda to help in the killing of the filmmaker
 yah mantri dharmanirpeksh avami neshnal party kaa sadsy he
 The minister announced this award during a press conference in Peshawar on Saturday
 unhone ek tivi channel par bhi apane is elaan ko doharaaya tha or apni party ke netaaon dwaara aalochana kiye jane ke baavjood apana rukh nahin badla tha
 The comments bilaur kaa elaan pakistan sarkaar ke liye ek sirdard ban gaya he kyonki yah tippanee aise samay main america akhabaaron kii surkhiyaan bani he jab pakistani raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari sanyukt raashtra mahasabha ke satr main shaamil hone ke liye neuyark ja rahe hai
 Home Minister Rehman Malik said last night that Bilour's remarks were his personal views and the government had nothing to do with it
 gauratlab he ki bilaur ne shanivaar ko peshawar main media ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha, ‘main aaj elaan karata hum ki paigambar mohammad ke bare main bakawaas karne vaale is ishnaindak or paapi kii jo koi bhi hatya karegaa, main use ek lakh dollar inaam duungaa
 '' videsh vibhaag ke pravaktaa muajjam khan ne bataaya ki islam virdohi film banane vaale vyakti ke khilaaf railmantri gulam ahamed bilaur kii ghoshnaa unka vyaktigat vichaar tha or iskaa pakistan sarkaar kii aadhikarik niti se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Khan said in a brief statement, "bilour's statement does not represent official policy
 ’’ haalanki, bayaan main yah nahin bataaya gaya ki bilaur ke khilaaf koi karrwai kii jaaegi yaa nahin? unhone taliban or alqaida se film nirmaataa kii hatya main madad karne kii apil kii thi
 This minister is a member of the secular Awami National Party
 mantri ne shanivaar ko peshawar main samvaadadaata sammelan ke dauraan is inam kaa elaan kiya tha
 He had also repeated this announcement on a TV channel and did not change his stand despite being criticized by the leaders of his party
 tippaniyan The announcement of Bilour has become a headache for the Pakistan government as the remarks have made headlines in the US newspapers when Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari is going to New York to attend the session of the UN General Assembly
 grahamantri rahamaan malik ne beeti raat kaha tha bilaur kii tippanee unke nijee vichaar hai or sarkaar kaa isse koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 It is worth noting that Bilour, while addressing the media in Peshawar on Saturday, said, 'I proclaim today that whoever kills this blasphemer and sinner who is talking nonsense about Prophet Muhammad, i will reward him with a million dollars

 Ultimately Baba was caught
 buudhvaar kii raat thik nau bajkar 21 minute par pichley 18 dinon se chal rahe hai voltage drame kaa di and ho gaya
 Sant Rampalco police arrested him from his same ashram in Hisar, where the area around the ashram had been a battleground for the past several days
 magar baba kii ye giraftaar chah logon kii maut, saikadon ghayalon or karodon kharch karwaane ke baad hui
 But the biggest truth is that the Baba who had been defying the law for so many days, when the same Baba was caught, he started pleading with the police that he would not surrender himself in court
 18 din kii lukachupi, 50 karod se jyaad kharch, chah jaane or dhai sau se zyada jakhmi logon kii keemat adaa karne ke baad aakhirkaar haryana police sant rampal ko unke bill main ghus kar giraftaar karne main kaamyaab rahi
 The biggest operation of the Haryana Police was completed

 Chandigarh so that it can be produced in the High Court there on 21 November

 But to avoid arrest, the drama that Baba did in the last 18 days, caused the death of six people, kept the police standing on one leg round the clock, after that no longer go to the same court and how many streams Baba got Are the ones
 haryana police ne deshadroh kaa maamla tak unke khilaaf darj kiya he
 It was clear in the afternoon, Photobaba's arrest was undoubtedly at 9
21 pm
 magar giraftaar kaa rasta dopaher ko hi saaf ho gaya tha
 In fact, the police had silently arrested Sant Rampal's wife, son and brother from the ashram
 iske baad aanan-fanan main sabhi ko adaalat main pesh bhi kar diya
 As soon as Baba got this news
 pehali baar baba ghabaraae
 After this, Baba sent the message to the police through his special people that he was ready to surrender but in court
 baba ne bharosa diya ki 21 november ko wo khud court main hajir ho jaaenge
 By that time it was too late
 police kii fajihat ho chuki thi
 So the Haryana Police made it clear that the question of surrender does not arise now
 iske baad baba ko unke khilaaf darj dhaaraon kii jaankaree di gai saath hi court kii fatkaar ke bare main bataaya gaya
 After this, Baba asked for some time, but was still not ready to surrender
 is bich or ardh sainik bal raat kareeb aath baje ashram main ghusane main kaamyaab rahi
 Around two thousand devotees were present inside the ashram
 police ne puri ehtiyaat ke saath saare bhakton ko pehle kabje main liya or phir aakhirkaar bhakton ke bich chupe baba ko bhi pakad hi liya
 According to police sources, Baba used to hide his face till the last time to avoid arrest
 pakade jane ke baad bhi wo lagaataar police se yahi gidgidate rahe ki unhen giraftaar naa kiya jaae wo khud court ke saamne sarender kar denge
 For the last 18 days, the police camped outside the ashram and waited for Baba to leave, but when Baba did not understand this, he attacked Baba's ashram on Wednesday
 baba ne auraton or bacchon ko aisa dhaal banaaya ki chah logon kii jaan chali gai
 But Baba wanted him to just stay in the ashram
 lambii khamoshi ke baad mangalvaar ko pehali baar police kuch harakat main dikhi thi
 Tear gas shells, sticks, threats, everything nephew and tried but still could not find the one for whom it was all
 puure din kii mehnat par raat kii kalimaa ne pani pher diya
 Attacking the ashram in the dark was not free from danger
 police ke opershan rokane se rampal ke samarthak or uski privet army bhi sust padane lagi
 The night had set
 ab police ne ek daanv khelaa
 The operation of the hidden operation first caught some personnel of Rampal's private army by confusing things for arrest and then apprehended about 200 soldiers
 ab police aage kii karrwai ke liye subah hone kaa intjaar karne lagi
 At five in the morning of 19 November, the police had achieved a great success in the capture of the soldiers of Rampal's private army
 ab tamaam javaanon kii brifing hui or police ne das baje se phir oparation chalaane kaa faisla kiya
 Meanwhile, the police again appealed to the people to come out on the mike
 chunki raat main hi baba ke privet army ke bahut se log pakade ja chuke the or ashram kii get va diwaar todi ja chuki thi
 So the process of people coming out started
 dopaher hote hote hajaaron log ashram se baahar nikaale ja chuke the
 By midday, the police did another trick
 achaanak afvaah faili ki sant rampal ko giraftaar kar liya gaya he
 On hearing this, many supporters panicked and came out of the ashram themselves

 haalanki, shivanand tiwari maanate hai ki lalu ke khilaaf jaanch kii yachika daayar karnaa unke jivan kii sabase badi bhul thi magar jadyu kaa maananaa he ki lalu aaj jis sthiti main he, uske liye keval shivanand tiwari hi jimmedaar he
 Senior JDU leader Sanjay Singh has said that Shivanand Tiwari is the Bhasmasur of Kalyug, whoever lays his hand on his head, dies
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki shivanand tiwariargedimein dobaaraa isliye shaamil hue hai taaki vah is party ko puri tareeke se nestnabud kar den
 Sanjay Singh said that Shivanand Tiwari is responsible for the situation in which Lalu Yadav is today and is serving a sentence in jail
 sanjay singh kaa kahana he ki aaj bhale shivanand tiwari lalu parivaar ke shubhachintak ban gaye hai, lekin inkaa mukhya makasad lalu parivaar ko bihar kii raajnneeti se ukhaad phenkane kaa he
 Taking a dig at Shivanand Tiwari, Sanjay Singh said that Shivanand Tiwari, who is not taking revenge for the birth of Lalu family, first sent a petition to Lalu and sent him to jail and now he is wearing ointment
 sanjay ne kaha ki aisa to girggit bhi apana rang nahin badalata he jis tareeke se shivanand tiwari apana rang badal rahe hai
 Ever since RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav was convicted by a special CBI court in Ranchi on December 23 in a fodder scam case and acquitted former Chief Minister Jagannath Mishra, RJD leaders questioned the decision of Judge Shivpal Singh Was
 argedy ke netaaon ke anusaar kyonki jagannatha mishra brahman jati se aate hai isliye nyaayadhish ne unhen bari kar diya or kyonki lalu yadav pichhadi jati se aate the isi vajah se un ko doshi qaraar diya gaya
 Sanjay Singh said that the manner in which the RJD leaders have made lukewarm comments on the court's decision, shows dislike for their court
 gauratlab he ki vishesh sibiai adaalat ke nyaayadhish shivpal singh ne argedy ke 3 netaa raghuvansh prasad singh, shivanand tiwari or tejasvi yadav or congress ke pravaktaa manish tiwari ko avmaananaa kaa notice jari kiya he or unhen 23 janvari ko nyaayalay ke samaksh prastut hone ke liye kaha he

 gopaldaas niraj ke nidhan par uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri karyaalay kii ore se twit kar dukh vyakt kiya gaya
 Kavi Gopal Das Neeraj's famous compositions and songs will not be forgotten till the end: # UPCM Shree # yogiadityanath — CM Office, goup (@cmofficeup) July 19, 2018 Some of Neeraj's composition collections - Dard Hai - Asavari - Clouds Am-song that didn't sing-something couple neeraj ke-neeraj ki paati-neeraj dohavali-song-agit-caravan passed away khaadya suraksha evam maanak (labling and disple), 2019draft banane main bhartiya khaadya suraksha evam maanak praadhikaran(ethesai)ko chah saal se bhi zyada samay lag gaya
 a draft came in 2018 but due to some objections it was reworked and a new final draft has come again this year
 to kya is draft ke jariye upabhokta yah jaan sakenge ki unka khaanaa diet ke hisaab se kitna khatarnaak yaa kitna nuksandeh he?ethescaike draft main food companiyon ko apane utpaadon main jaankaree dene ke dishanirdesh die gaye hai
 But the consumer will have to be very intelligent for this

 Amit Khurana, program manager at Food Safety and Toxins at the Center for Science and Environment, says, "then the question arises why FSSAI does not want to model this successful experiment?" a large part of India's population is still far from illiterate and English language
 chitron or rangon ke jariye di gai chetavanee kaa asar bharat ke ek bade hisse par hone kii puri sambhaavna he
 Then why this hesitation? ”khurana asks, how many people in India know that sodium is salt? Will a person of common sense understand words like Aided Sugar, Trans Fat? Khurana seems to be very close to the ground reality
 vaaki kam se kam gaanv main baitha hui ek vyakti food companiyon kii pahelinuma chetavanee ko samaj paaegaa yah bharosa karnaa mushkil he
 What is in the FSSAIK draft? The warning will be something like this as soon as the rules of Food Safety and Standards (labeling and Display), 2019 are made? Why avoid writing salt? Why can't trans and saturated fat be written as fat directly? Why can't red paint show a direct threat?
