 uttar pradesh kii purv mukhyamantri or basapa supremeo mayawati ne uttar pradesh main apni or hathi kii murtiyon banane ke faisle kaa bachaav karte hue supreme court main jawaab daayar kiya he
 Responding to the notice of the court, Mayawati said on Tuesday that these idols have been constructed according to the wishes of the public
 saath hi unhone iske peeche apane samarpan ko bhi ek vajah bataaya or iskaa unhone bade bhavuk andaaj main jawaab diya
 In response to the Supreme Court notice, Mayawati wrote, 'I have devoted my whole life to bringing backward and downtrodden people into the mainstream
 apane samarpan kii hi vajah se maine tay kiya ki main vivaah nahin karuungi
 i have built these monuments only to fulfill the expectations of the public
 'kanshiram ko mili bharat ratnabaspa supremeo ne court ko die jawaab main apane chaar baar ke shashan main vanchit varg ke liye kiye gaye kaamon kaa kaa zikr karte hue bataaya ki jab-jab main uttar pradesh kii mukhyamantri rahi, maine pichhadon ke liye kai ahm yojanaayen chalaayin
 He said that the poor, backward and deprived people had expressed this wish to Kanshi Ram, the public wants that Kanshi Ram should get Bharat Ratna posthumously
 mayawati ne tamaam smarakon or murtiyon ke nirmaan kii vajah janata kii ichha ko bataaya he
 The former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister said in an affidavit in the Supreme Court that the motive behind building the statues and memorials of him and other leaders is to propagate the values and ideals of various saints, gurus, social reformers and leaders among the public and not the BSP
 Promote or glorify one's own mark
 unhone kaha ki smarakon ke nirmaan or pratimaayein sthapit karne ke liye nidhi bajtiy aavanton or rajya vidhansabha kii manjuuri ke jariye sweekrut kii gai he
 Misuse of government funds? Mayawati has called it politically motivated and a gross violation of law, seeking to dismiss a petition alleging misuse of public funds in the construction of statues
 supreme court ne 8 farvari ko kaha tha ki mayawati ko uttar pradesh main saarvajanik sthanon par apni or party ke chihn hathi kii mutiyaan lagane ke liye istemaal kii gai saarvajanik kosh sarkari rajkosh main jamaa karaani chahie

 About Rs 2,000 crore has been used from the state budget

 And it started with the pretext of Pranab Mukherjee
 is baar kaa raashtrapati chunaav kai vajahon se yaad kiya jayega
 This time, all the coalitions broke down, as well as a rift in the UPA
 
 
 endie main maar
 
 
 And wrangling among the Left
 lekin, sabase ahm he nitish kumaar kaa bijepi se dhire−dhire kinaaraa karnaa
 Actually, both Nitish and Narendra Modi have considered themselves candidates for the Prime Minister
 modi ne bijepi par apana dabadabaa kaayam rakhaa he
 
 
 Sanjay Joshi had to withdraw
 adwani or sushamaa ne apane aap ko kinare kar liya
 Nitish knows that Sangma's name for the presidency was proposed by Jayalalitha, who is very close to Narendra Modi
 yahi vajah he ki jediu sangama ke naam par bidak gaya
 Even Nitish did not pick up Sangma's phone
 nitish ko yah bhi pataa he ki bhale hi modi abhi becoground main hon lekin 2014 ke chunaav kii asli kaman unheen ke haath main rahegi
 Nitish seems to have decided to end the JDU and BJP alliance in Bihar just before the Gujarat elections
 yahi vajah he ki nitish ne shivanand tiwari ko endie kii baithak main sa taur par dilli bheja
 Perhaps Nitish would not have been so confident of Sharad Yadav
 baithak main shivanand tiwari ne pranab da kaa paksh liya lekin sushamaa swaraj adi raheen
 Sushma referred to the meeting of Advani and Jayalalithaa and talked about contesting elections
 bijepi ko abhi tak kalam ke haa kehane kii ummid thi
 JDU said which new tradition are we going to start where once after 5 years of becoming President, the name of the same person is being considered
 abhi tak desh main aisa hua nahin he
 It was said in the meeting that Pranab Mukherjee should not be considered the candidate of Sonia Gandhi, because no one should have any doubt on his stature and his political experience
 lekin, baat nahin bani
 Bal Thackeray had already supported Pranab Mukherjee in 'saamana' and now JDU also split
 ab jaraa nitish or narendra modi ke naram−garam rishton par gaur karen
 
 
 Remember the last day of the 2009 election campaign
 ludhiana main endie kii raily main sabhi bade netaa jute modi bhi or nitish bhi
 Nitish Kumar was keeping an eye out for Modi, but even the stalled players themselves came to Nitish, hugged and shook hands
 magar is tasviir main daraar us vakt dikhi jab patna main bijepi kii kaaryakarini kii baithak ke pehle din bihar ke akhabaaron main ek ishtehaar chapa jisamen is baat kaa bhi zikr kiya gaya ki kis tarah gujarat ne kosi kii baadh ke vakt bihar kii madad kii
 After this, Nitish Kumar erupted
 nitish kumaar ne fouran is poster se apni tasviir hataane ke liye kaha
 Not only this, the money received in the name of Kosi's help was returned to the Gujarat government
 or bijepi kii kaaryakarini ke sammaan main di jane vaali daavat bhi radd kar di
 In fact, Nitish knows that in Bihar, the backward alliances with the backward castes, Mahadalits and minorities are giving strength to their politics, their close rift with Modi
 isliye vah aisa koi mauka jane nahin dete jisamen vah modi se alag or asahmat hote dikhen
 Recently, when Modi mentioned the casteist politics of Bihar, Nitish taunted that Modi should worry about Gujarat and not Bihar
 tippaniyan Not only this, a special issue came out recently on Nitish Sarkar in an English magazine in which his government was criticized
 nitish kumaar isse bhi khafa hai ki usee patrika main gujarat sarkaar kaa 16 pej kaa vigyaapan vaala ek parishisht bhi chapa he
 Modi's hand is also seen in this close to Nitish
 vaise nitish ko andaaza he ki modi ke sawaal par bijepi kaa ek hissaa achaanak samvedansheel ho uthta he or aise tatv unki sarkaar main bhi sakriy hai
 a minister in his own government started making statements in favor of Modi
 haalanki jediu is masale par puri tarah unke saath he
 Obviously, Nitish wants to increase his stature and also play an important role in national politics
 lekin kya isi bahaane vah upie ke najadik aa rahe hai
 
 
 For now, it is a little early to say that as of now, it is not known what they will get from the center
 bihar main kanoon vyavastha to thik hui he, logon kaa palaayan bhi kam hua he lekin vahaan bijli kii samasya gambhir he or ab logon kaa sabar tut rahaa he
 This time the presidential election will be remembered for many reasons
 is baar saare gathbandhan tut gaye saath hi, upie main daraar
 
 
 Kill in NDA
 
 
 or vamadalon main takaraar
 But, the most important thing is to gradually distance Nitish Kumar from BJP
 darasal, nitish or narendra modi donon apneaap ko pradhanmantri kaa ummidavaar maan chuke hai
 Modi has continued to dominate the BJP
 
 
 sanjay joshi ko hatana padaa
 Advani and Sushma sidelined themselves
 nitish ko maaloom he ki raashtrapati pad ke liye sangama ke naam kaa prastaav jayalalita ne rakhaa jo narendra modi se kaaphi najadik hai
 This is the reason why JDU got sidelined in the name of Sangma
 yahaan tak ki nitish ne sangama kaa phone tak nahin uthaaya
 Nitish also knows that even though Modi is still in the background, the real command of the 2014 elections will remain in his hands
 lagata he nitish ne tay kar liya he ki gujarat chunaav se thik pehle bihar main jediu or bijepi gathbandhan khatm kar diya jaae
 This is the reason that Nitish sent Shivanand Tiwari to Delhi as an NDA meeting
 shaayad nitish ko sharad yadav par utana bharosa nahin rah gaya hoga
 Shivanand Tiwari favored Pranab da in the meeting but Sushma Swaraj remained adamant
 sushamaa ne adwani or jayalalita kii baithak kaa hawala diya or chunaav ladane kii baat kahi
 The BJP was yet to expect Kalam to say yes
 jediu kaa kahana tha ki yah koun si nai parampara kii ham shuruyaat karne ja rahe hai jahaan ek baar raashtrapati banane ke 5 saal baad phir usee vyakti ke naam par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 This has not happened in the country yet
 baithak main kaha gaya ki pranab mukherjee ko keval sonia gandhi kaa ummidavaar na maanakar sabakaa ummidavaar bana diya jaae kyonki unke kad or unke raajnneetik anubhav par kisi ko koi andeh nahin hona chahie
 But it did not work
 bal thakare pehle hi 'saamana' main pranab mukherjee ko samarthan de chuke the or ab jediu bhi alag ho gai
 Now consider the warm relations between Nitish and Narendra Modi
 
 
 yaad kiijie 2009 ke chunaav prachaar kaa antim din
 All the big leaders gathered in NDA rally in Ludhiana, Modi and Nitish too
 nitish kumaar modi se najar bachaa rahe the lekin modi bhi tehre khilaadi khud chalakar niteesha ke paas pahunche, gale mili or haath milaayaa
 But the cracks in this picture were seen when on the first day of the BJP executive meeting in Patna, a newspaper was published in Bihar newspapers mentioning how Gujarat helped Bihar during the Kosi floods
 iske baad nitish kumaar bhadak gaye
 Nitish Kumar immediately asked this poster to remove his picture
 yahi nahin, kosi kii madad ke naam par mili rakam gujarat sarkaar ko waapas kar di
 And the feast in honor of the BJP executive was also canceled
 darasal nitish ko maaloom he ki bihar main atipichhadon, mahadaliton or alpsankhyakon ke saath pichhadon kaa jo gathjod unki raajnneeti ko takat de rahaa he usamen modi se unki qareebi daraar daal sakati he
 Therefore, he does not allow any such opportunity in which he appears to be different and disagreeing with Modi
 haal hi main jab modi ne bihar kii jativaadee raajnneeti kaa zikr kiya to nitish ne taana maaraa ki modi gujarat kii chintaa karen, bihar kii nahin
 The comments yahi nahin, haal main hi ek angreji patrika main nitish sarkaar par ek visheshank aayaa jisamen unki sarkaar kii aalochana kii gai thi
 Nitish Kumar is also unhappy that an appendix containing a 16-page advertisement of the Gujarat government is also printed in the same magazine
 nitish ke najdiki isamen bhi modi kaa haath dekh rahe hai
 By the way, Nitish knows that a section of BJP suddenly becomes sensitive on Modi's question and such elements are active in his government as well
 unki hi sarkaar ke ek mantri ne modi ke haq main bayaan dene shuru kar die
 However, JDU is fully with them on this issue
 jaahir he niteesha apana kad badhaane or rashtriya raajnneeti main apni ek ahm bhoomika bhi chaahate hai
 But is he coming close to the UPA on the same excuse
 
 
 philhal yah kahana thodi jaldbaaji hogi kyonki abhi tak yah nahin pataa ki badale main kendra se unhen kya milegaa
 The law and order in Bihar has been fixed, the migration of people has also reduced but the power problem is serious there and now the patience of the people is getting broken
 lekin, sabase ahm he nitish kumaar kaa bijepi se dhire−dhire kinaaraa karnaa
 Actually, both Nitish and Narendra Modi have considered themselves candidates for the Prime Minister
 modi ne bijepi par apana dabadabaa kaayam rakhaa he

 nitish ko maaloom he ki raashtrapati pad ke liye sangama ke naam kaa prastaav jayalalita ne rakhaa jo narendra modi se kaaphi najadik hai
 This is the reason why JDU got sidelined in the name of Sangma
 yahaan tak ki nitish ne sangama kaa phone tak nahin uthaaya
 Nitish also knows that even though Modi is still in the background, the real command of the 2014 elections will remain in his hands
 lagata he nitish ne tay kar liya he ki gujarat chunaav se thik pehle bihar main jediu or bijepi gathbandhan khatm kar diya jaae
 This is the reason that Nitish sent Shivanand Tiwari to Delhi as an NDA meeting
 shaayad nitish ko sharad yadav par utana bharosa nahin rah gaya hoga
 Shivanand Tiwari favored Pranab da in the meeting but Sushma Swaraj remained adamant
 sushamaa ne adwani or jayalalita kii baithak kaa hawala diya or chunaav ladane kii baat kahi
 The BJP was yet to expect Kalam to say yes
 jediu kaa kahana tha ki yah koun si nai parampara kii ham shuruyaat karne ja rahe hai jahaan ek baar raashtrapati banane ke 5 saal baad phir usee vyakti ke naam par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 This has not happened in the country yet
 baithak main kaha gaya ki pranab mukherjee ko keval sonia gandhi kaa ummidavaar na maanakar sabakaa ummidavaar bana diya jaae kyonki unke kad or unke raajnneetik anubhav par kisi ko koi andeh nahin hona chahie
 But it did not work
 bal thakare pehle hi 'saamana' main pranab mukherjee ko samarthan de chuke the or ab jediu bhi alag ho gai
 Now consider the warm relations between Nitish and Narendra Modi
 
 
 yaad kiijie 2009 ke chunaav prachaar kaa antim din
 All the big leaders gathered in NDA rally in Ludhiana, Modi and Nitish too
 nitish kumaar modi se najar bachaa rahe the lekin modi bhi tehre khilaadi khud chalakar niteesha ke paas pahunche, gale mili or haath milaayaa
 But the cracks in this picture were seen when on the first day of the BJP executive meeting in Patna, a newspaper was published in Bihar newspapers mentioning how Gujarat helped Bihar during the Kosi floods
 iske baad nitish kumaar bhadak gaye
 Nitish Kumar immediately asked this poster to remove his picture

 Therefore, he does not allow any such opportunity in which he appears to be different and disagreeing with Modi

 Sushma referred to the meeting of Advani and Jayalalithaa and talked about contesting elections
 bijepi ko abhi tak kalam ke haa kehane kii ummid thi
 JDU said which new tradition are we going to start where once after 5 years of becoming President, the name of the same person is being considered
 abhi tak desh main aisa hua nahin he
 It was said in the meeting that Pranab Mukherjee should not be considered the candidate of Sonia Gandhi, because no one should have any doubt on his stature and his political experience
 lekin, baat nahin bani
 Bal Thackeray had already supported Pranab Mukherjee in 'saamana' and now JDU also split
 ab jaraa nitish or narendra modi ke naram−garam rishton par gaur karen
 
 
 Remember the last day of the 2009 election campaign
 ludhiana main endie kii raily main sabhi bade netaa jute modi bhi or nitish bhi
 Nitish Kumar was keeping an eye out for Modi, but even the stalled players themselves came to Nitish, hugged and shook hands
 magar is tasviir main daraar us vakt dikhi jab patna main bijepi kii kaaryakarini kii baithak ke pehle din bihar ke akhabaaron main ek ishtehaar chapa jisamen is baat kaa bhi zikr kiya gaya ki kis tarah gujarat ne kosi kii baadh ke vakt bihar kii madad kii
 After this, Nitish Kumar erupted
 nitish kumaar ne fouran is poster se apni tasviir hataane ke liye kaha
 Not only this, the money received in the name of Kosi's help was returned to the Gujarat government
 or bijepi kii kaaryakarini ke sammaan main di jane vaali daavat bhi radd kar di
 In fact, Nitish knows that in Bihar, the backward alliances with the backward castes, Mahadalits and minorities are giving strength to their politics, their close rift with Modi
 isliye vah aisa koi mauka jane nahin dete jisamen vah modi se alag or asahmat hote dikhen
 Recently, when Modi mentioned the casteist politics of Bihar, Nitish taunted that Modi should worry about Gujarat and not Bihar
 tippaniyan Not only this, a special issue came out recently on Nitish Sarkar in an English magazine in which his government was criticized
 nitish kumaar isse bhi khafa hai ki usee patrika main gujarat sarkaar kaa 16 pej kaa vigyaapan vaala ek parishisht bhi chapa he
 Modi's hand is also seen in this close to Nitish
 vaise nitish ko andaaza he ki modi ke sawaal par bijepi kaa ek hissaa achaanak samvedansheel ho uthta he or aise tatv unki sarkaar main bhi sakriy hai
 a minister in his own government started making statements in favor of Modi
 haalanki jediu is masale par puri tarah unke saath he
 Obviously, Nitish wants to increase his stature and also play an important role in national politics
 lekin kya isi bahaane vah upie ke najadik aa rahe hai
 
 
 For now, it is a little early to say that as of now, it is not known what they will get from the center
 bihar main kanoon vyavastha to thik hui he, logon kaa palaayan bhi kam hua he lekin vahaan bijli kii samasya gambhir he or ab logon kaa sabar tut rahaa he
 The BJP was yet to expect Kalam to say yes

 Nitish Kumar is also unhappy that an appendix containing a 16-page advertisement of the Gujarat government is also printed in the same magazine
 nitish ke najdiki isamen bhi modi kaa haath dekh rahe hai
 By the way, Nitish knows that a section of BJP suddenly becomes sensitive on Modi's question and such elements are active in his government as well
 unki hi sarkaar ke ek mantri ne modi ke haq main bayaan dene shuru kar die
 However, JDU is fully with them on this issue

 The committee constituted on 1 January met Information Broadcasting Minister Arun Jaitley in Mumbai on Saturday to discuss and suggest what should be the format of what came under the jurisdiction of censor scissors 
 cameti ke adhyaksh jane maane filmkaar shyaam benegal hai
 The board's functioning and controversy among the members made a lot of headlines after the incumbent Censor Chief Pahlaj Nihalani was placed on the chair
 maheenon baad soochna prasaaran mantralay ko kendriya film pramann board kii phikr hui, shyaam benegal kii adhyakshata main sensor ko sudhaarney ke liye cameti banaai
 The comments cameti kii pehali baithak main jubaani taur par elaan kiya, kya dikhaanaa kya nahin dikhaanaa ye sarkaar kaa kaam nahin
 Minister of State for Information Broadcasting, Rajwardhan Singh Rathore said, 'the government does not want to decide what people should see or not see
 cameti ke adhyaksh shyaam benegal ne kaha, 'sabase zaruri he ki kanchi chalaane kii koshish naa ho, bharat ek jatil desh he isliye dishanirdesh bahut saavdhaanee se banane honge ye dekhte hue ki aap avarohak naa ban jaaen
 The committee to reform CBFC includes Aid Guru Piyush Pandey, Filmmaker, Rakesh Mehra, and Bhavna Soumayya

 The committee is headed by noted filmmaker Shyam Benegal
 sanskari sensor chif pehlaaj nihlani ko kursi par bithaane ke baad board kii kaaryastylee, sadasyon ke bich vivaad ne khub surkhiyaan batorin
 Months later, the Ministry of Information Broadcasting was concerned about the Central Board of Film Certification, formed a committee to reform censors under the chairmanship of Shyam Benegal
 tippaniyan In the first meeting of the committee announced verbally, what to show or not to show is not the work of the government
 soochna prasaaran, rajya mantri rajvardhan singh rathore ne kaha, 'sarkaar ye tay nahin karnaa chaahati ki log kya dekhen, kya naa dekhen
 Committee Chairman Shyam Benegal said, 'the most important thing is not to try scissors, India is a complicated country, so guidelines have to be made very carefully, seeing that you don't become a blocker
 ' sibiefasi ko sudhaarney vaali cameti main aid guru piyush pandey, filmkaar, rakesh mehara, or bhaavana saumayya shaamil hai

 yues open 2018 ke mahila ekal varg ke final mukaable ko tennis phens hameshaa yaad rakhenge
 There are 2 reasons behind this
 pehla ek nae champion kaa saamne aana or doosaraserena williamski chair ampire ke saath tikhi bahes
 Japan won 6–2, 6–4 over Serena Williams in the Kinaomi Osakane final
 osaka kaa yah pehla grandslam khitaab he
 Osaka became the first player to do this feat on behalf of Japan
 serena or osaka ke bich is match ko grandslam ke sabase vivaadit final ke taur par bhi janaa jayega
 Having won the Grand Slam title 23 times so far, a large number of fans arrived at the stadium to watch the match of Serena Williams
 phens ko ummid thi serena margrat court ke 24 grandslam khitaab ke sarvakalik record kii barabari kar lengi
 But this could not happen
 match haarane ke baad bhi diggaj tennis khilaadi serena williams surkhiyon main bani huin hai
 In fact, Serena Williams faced a penalty during the second set of the game, after which she flashed on the umpire
 game ke dauraan serena ke coach unhen kuch ishaare kar rahe the
 Serena said that she does not want to win the match by cheating (dishonestly)
 serena ne penlti dene ke liye ampire ko chor bhi kaha
 Serena Williams, 36, was awarded a penalty by the umpire for violating the rules during the game
 serena ne ampire se kaha ki main jeetne ke liye beyimaani nahin karti
 After today you will not be a part of any of my matches
 tum jhuthe ho or iske liye tumhen mujhase maafee maangani chahie
 You snatched a score of the match from me and so you are also a thief
 serena ke mutabik coach sirf unka utsaah badhaane ke liye unhen angootha dikhaa rahe the
 The anger that persisted even after the match ended, Serena's anger with the umpire continued even after the match was over
 unhone ampire se haath nahin milaayaa or match ke baad kaha ki main philhal sawaal uthaakar ashisht vyavhaar nahin karnaa chaahati
 This is Naomi Osaka's first Grand Slam, thus making the victory a happy one for them
 osaka ne match ke baad kaha ki ab bhi lag hi nahin rahaa ki vastav main aisa ho gaya he
 Maybe in a few days i will realize what i have done
 penlti ke jariye ek game milane par osaka ne kaha ki jab sab kuch hua to score 5-3 tha isliye main thodi bhram main thi
 He said that i felt i had to keep my focus
 vah champion khilaadi he isliye mujhe pataa he ki vah kisi bhi ank ke samay vaapasi kar sakati he
 Somewhere the beauty of tea gardens, and the challenge of race on the river bend (rough stones along the river)
 kahin jangalon main car chalaane kaa imtihaan, to kahin pattharon se car ko bachaane kii chunauti
 Somewhere, the passion of driving for 14 hours and the fear of getting lost on the entangled paths
 lekin, mushkilen hi na hon, to phir manzil paane kaa majaa hi kya he
 The opportunity was for the JK Himalayan Drive Triation Car Rally
 desh kii wo iklauti raily jo teen deshon se hokar guzarati he
 India, Nepal and Bhutan
 ek- duusare se aage nikalne kii hode or main or mashin ke behatar talmail ke anuthe udhaaharan vaali is raily kaa aagaaj siliguri se hua
 The passion of motorsports brought together speed enthusiasts from India, Nepal and Bhutan and the challenge was to become the best in a journey of about 1700 km in 5 days
 yah car raily tiesdi formet kii raily thi
 That is, suddenly arriving at the given route according to the time already scheduled
 ek second deree se pahunche to ek second kii penlti or ek second pehle pahunche, to 2 second kii penlti
 Compulsion to run according to international rules
 har din ausatan 8-10 ghante kii kamartod driving or kam se kam galati karne kaa dabaav is res ko or dilachasp bana rahaa tha
 Not only this, the complexity of different calculations according to different times of india-nepal-bhutan was enough to confuse the teams strategy
 jaisaa ki ovelol vijeta asagar ali or mohammad mustafa ne kaha bhi 'yah raily seconds kaa khel thi
 The one who withstood the pressure better became the winner
 ' just sports ke tamal ghoshaal bataate hai 'motorsports khaskar, ofroding main trek har kisi ke aakarshan kaa centre hote hai
 Our effort has also been to include the best tracks of the three countries in the rally

 On the occasion of the 127th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, a group of Sikhs demonstrated at the United Nations headquarters against alleged atrocities with minority communities in India
 sanyukt raashtra main bharat ke sthaayee mishan ne ambedkar kii 127veen jayanti kaa jashn manaane ke liye kal sanyukt raashtra main 'leaving no van bihaind' sheershak se vishesh kaarykram yojit kiya tha

 As soon as Akbaruddin's speech ended, the group of Sikhs walked out of the conference room where they were also questioned by UN police and security personnel
 shiromani akali dal amritsar uese or yuva akali dal amritsar uese se jude sikhon ne surakshakarmiyon ko bataaya ki ve chupchaap shantipurvak pradarshan kar rahe the
 a protester Sabjit Singh said that Ambedkar's vision was to ensure equality for all communities, minorities and Dalits and he also mentioned it in the Indian Constitution
 unhone kaha, 'lekin bharat main satta main ai bhaajapa sarkaar desh ko ek hindu raashtra bananaa chaahati he

 Jaipal Reddy has been given the Department of Science Technology in the cabinet reshuffle
 virodhiyon kaa aarope he ki reliance ko jaipal reddy se mushkil ho rahi thi isliye unhen hataaya gaya
 Veerappa Moily is now the new petroleum minister
 bijepi bhi ise mudda bana rahi he
 Party leader Venkaiah Naidu has said that the government should answer why a senior minister like Reddy was shifted from the petroleum ministry to another ministry
 unhonen iske peeche petroleum industry ke dabaav kaa mudda bhi uthaaya
 Arvind Kejriwal, a member of India Against Corruption, has also questioned the take of petroleum from Jaipal Reddy
 kejariwal ne kaha he ki is pherbadal ke jariye kahin na kahin centre sarkaar ne ye sanket die hai ki jo jitna bhrasht hoga use utani tarakkee milegi
 The comments lekin, virappa moili kaa kahana he jaipal reddy acha kaam kar rahe the
 It is not right to find any intention behind changing his ministry
 vahiin, shahari vikasmantri kamalnath ne kaha he ki bijepi ke aarope bebuniyaad hai or unki sarkaar ke dauraan bhi is tarah ke pherbadal hote rahe hai
 In fact, there are several reasons to believe that Reliance was unhappy with Jaipal Reddy

 The Ministry said, EGOM has fixed the price, which is to be revised in 2014 itself

 He also raised the issue of pressure from the petroleum industry behind it
 jaipal reddy se petroleum liye jane par india against karpshan ke sadsy arvind kejariwal ne bhi sawaal uthaaya he
 Kejriwal has said that somewhere through this reshuffle, the central government has indicated that the more corrupt it is, the more it gets

 unka mantralay badale jane ke peeche koi manshaa khojna thik nahin
 At the same time, Urban Development Minister Kamal Nath has said that bjp's allegations are baseless and such changes have been taking place even during his government
 darasal, ye maanane kii kai vajahen hai ki reliance jaipal reddy se naakhush rahaa
 Jaipal Reddy has rejected several Reliance proposals
 jaise - His demand to increase the price of natural gas was rejected
 −mantralay ne kaha, ijioem daam tay kar chukaa he jisapar 2014 main hi sanshodhan hona he
 −reddy also ordered an inquiry into the expenditure on KG D6 of the KG basin −keji basin se gas utpaadan mentin rakhane kii naakaami ke evaj main reliance ke 1

 Everyone is upset about who or how the government was formed in Delhi
 in sabake bich kabhi arvind kejariwal kii sahyogi raheen kiran bedi ne sarkaar banane kaa formula sujhaayaa he
 Kiran Bedi has tweeted that even though Delhi's results point towards a hung assembly, an anti-congress government can still be formed
 sarkaar kaise bane or kaise chale ise lekar kiran bedi ne kai twit kiye
 Kiran Bedi's formulation of government formation Bedi wrote, "it is an injustice to the people of Delhi that they will not get a permanent government and will hold elections again
" aise main bijepi or AAP kii jimmedaari banati he ki wo sushasan den
 Kiran Bedi further tweeted, "honoring this mandate, senior BJP and AAP leaders should jointly create a common minimum program
 varanaa phir se chunaav kaa vikalp to he hi
 Advising the AAP, Kiran Bedi said, 'kejriwal and his party brought new ways to contest elections
 ab sarkaar chalaane ke nae tareekon kii sambhaavna talaashi ja sakati he
 The Common Minimum Program is one of them
 'kiran bedi ne is sambandh main aakhri twit likhaa he, 'aap or bijepi ko ek saath milakar nunatam saajha kaarykram bananaa chahie jiske jariye ve shashan nahin seva karenge
 a new variety is expected from this divided mandate
 iskaa sammaan hona chahie
 'then there is no option but election: AAP Kiran Bedi suggested the formula but it did not get support from BJP or AAP
 darasal, somvaar subah ko AAP kii chunaav samiti kii baithak hui
 The result was that the people did not give the mandate to form the government, so the role of the opposition should be played
 manish sisodiya ne kaha ki party ne tay kiya he ki ham vipaksh main baithenge
 Do not take support from anyone and do not give
 aise main dobaaraa chunaav ke alaava koi vikalp nahin he
 BJP will not manipulate
 BJP has also denied the possibility of forming a government
 party ke siem ummidavaar dow harshavardhan saaf kar chuke hai ki unki party ke paas wo sankhya nahin hai jiske boote sarkaar banaai jaae
 In such a situation, the decision has to be taken by Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung of Delhi
 sutron kii maane to aresas ne bhi bijepi ko nirdesh diya he ki wo kisi tarah ke jod-tod main shaamil na ho
 If the government is formed in a natural way, otherwise it would be right for the party to sit in opposition

 The successes of Bollywood actor Karthik Aaryan are touching heights these days
 'pyaar kaa panchnaama' se bollywood main kadam rakhane ke baad karthik aryan ne 'sonu' or 'guddu' banakar logon kaa khub dil jeeta he
 People now not only like to watch his movies, but also like his style a lot
 lekin karthik aryan ke liye in oonchaaiyon tak pahunch paanaa itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 The actor himself has revealed this in the social media blog 'humans of Bombay'
 is blog main karthik aryan ne bataaya ki unhen studio ke baahar se hi bina audishan diye bhej diya jaataa tha
 xxrep 8 ? # Repost @officialhumansofbombay "I was born in the small town of Gwalior
 My parents were in d medical field & i was going to do engineering
 But in 9th grade, i saw Baazigar & i knew i wanted to be on the other side of the screen
 i was unsure of my parents' reaction—so i decided to study till 12th in Gwalior & den go to college in Mumbai
 Luckily i got into a college in Navi Mumbai
 i stayed in a hostel & searched for auditions
 i had no contacts, so I'd type keywords like, 'actor Needed' on Facebook
 I'd travel for 6 hours 3-4 times a week for auditions
 At times, I'd be rejected from outside the studio because i didn't 'look the part'
 But i still had hope
 Soon i got projects like a few seconds in an ad & they kept me going
 Eventually i rented a flat in Andheri with 12 boys
 i had limited finances
 i couldn't even afford a portfolio—i'd crop my face out of group photos to send to agents! All the while I'd skip college to give auditions & my parents didn't know about any of this
 Once i saw an ad for a film audition & decided to go for it
 They liked me & auditioned me many times
 My final audition script was the monologue that then became my identity! Finally, when i got the role, i was at Andheri station & immediately called my mom! She couldn't believe it! After 2 & a half years of struggle, what i had imagined as a possibility, was now a reality
 After Pyaar Ka Punchama, there still weren't many opportunities
 i stayed in the same flat with 12 boys till my third film! At the time, my mom was adamant i finish my degree, so while shooting, i gave my exams — & people in the exam hall were clicking photos with me! But i understood that she wanted my future to be secure
 After Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety, it all changed! Life has come full circle now—recently when i was in Gwalior, i was invited to my school as chief guest & kids were chanting my name! It was surreal! But what i have today, would've never come my way, if i hadn't believed that I'd make it
 I'm grateful for where i am & i know i have a long way to go
 Sometimes all of it still feels unbelievable from this point on,the possibilities just seem endless & my dreams, r just waiting to come true
 a post shared by KARTIK AARYAN (@kartikaaryan) on Dec 3, 2019 at 1:59 am PST Kartik Aaryan (kartik Aaryan) recounting his days of struggle told, "I was born in the small town of Gwalior
 mata-pita medical field main the or main ejineering karne ja rahaa tha
 But in ninth grade, i saw Baazigar and i knew that i wanted to be on the other side of the screen
 mujhe apane mata-pita ke riection ke bare main nahin maaloom tha, isliye maine tay kiya ki main 12veen tak gwalior main padhuunga or college ke liye mumbai jaaoongaa
 Luckily i got a college in Navi Mumbai and i started living in hostels there
 mere paas acting line se jude koi contacts nahin the, isli main fasebuk par 'actor nided' kivardkas tip karata tha
 "kartik Aaryan further explained his journey," i used to travel for about 6 hours three-four days a week for auditions
 us samay main studio ke baahar se hi riject ho jaataa tha kyonki main us hisse kaa nahin dikhataa tha
 Even after that i had hope
 jald hi mujhe kuch sacends ke aid milane lage
 On that occasion, i took a flat in Andheri with 12 people
 mere paas simit paise hote the, inase main apana photoshute bhi nahin karvaa saktaa tha
 So i used to send my photo from the group photo to the agent
 kai baar maine in audishans ke liye apana college bi banks kiya or mere mata pita ko is bare main kuch nahin pataa tha
 Once i saw an advertisement for a film audition and thought of going there
 "karthik aryan (kartik Aaryan) ne filmi kariyar ke bare main bataaya, "audishan main main unhen pasand aayaa or unhone kai baar meraa audishan liya
 When i got the role, i called my mother, she could not believe it at all
 kareeb dhai saalon ke sangharsh ke baad mujhe apana sapana sach hota dikhaa
 i did not have much achievements after 'pyaar Ka Panchnama'
 meri mummy adi thim ki main apni degree puri kar luun
 i gave my exams and people sitting in the hall started taking pictures of me
 'sonu ke titu kii sweety' ke baad yah sab badal gaya
 When i went to Gwalior, i was called as the Chief Guest in my school and the children were taking my name
 lekin aaj jo mere paas he, vah kabhi nahin hota agar maine vishwaas na kiya hota
 i am proud of where i am at the moment

 ' centre kii modi sarkaar ne guuruuvaar ko apane is kaarykaal kaa aakhri purnakalik bajet pesh kiya
 The Modi government showed favor in the budget to bring a smile on the face of the farmers and tribals as well as the minorities of the country

 In this way, the Ministry of Minority was increased by Rs 505 crore as compared to the budget of 2018-19

 In 2014, Narendra Modi ascended the throne of the government with a thumping majority
 sarkaar ne apana pehla bajet 2014-15 main pesh kiya
 The contradiction between the BJP and the minorities, it seemed that the Modi government would not give any special consideration to the Minority Ministry
 lekin pradhanmantri modi ne is kayaas todate hue apane mul mantra 'sabakaa-saath, sabakaa-vikaas' ke tahat alpsankhyakon ke liye apane pehle bajet main 3711 karod rupee kaa dhan aavantit kiya tha

 alpsankhyak mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne ise ab tak kii sabase badi badhotaree bataaya tha
 This was the highest in the history of minority ministry
 bijepi ke satta main aane ke baad pichley chaaron bajet ko dekhen to kareeb 500 karod rupee kaa ijapha tha
 Significantly, the Manmohan government set up a separate ministry in 2006 for the development of minorities

 If these symptoms are seen then it is better to end the relationship! It is often seen that parents listen to their children in childhood but not in adolescence

 First of all, Pakistan has managed to tell the people of our country on the Perception Management front that there was no loss of life or property in India's action
 jahaan tak javaabi karrwai kii baat he to pakistan ke paas simit vikalp maujuud hai
 Ajay Sahni believes that Pakistan will increase the mortar and artillery firing and will tell its countrymen that it has caused great harm to India

 Limited options for increase in proxy war Pakistan has for decades been waging proxy war against India instead of direct fight by helping its non-military militant groups with resources
 aise main pakistani sena or vahaan kii khufia agency iesai seemaa paar se aatanki gatividhiyaan badha sakate hai
 Ajay Lele believes that in view of the action taken by India in response to the Pulwama attack, Pakistan will not do any such thing, which will cause India to think of even bigger retaliation
 isliye aatankwaad ke morche par philhal pakistani sena or iesai intjaar karo or dekho kii ranneeti par kaam karegi
 The action of the Air Force The Pakistani Air Force may also consider such an option in response to the Air Strike of the Indian Air Force
 haalanki bhartiya vayusena ke hamale main pakistan ke begunaahon yaa sena ke kisi jawan kii kshati nahin hui he, balki bharat ne paak aadhaarit aatanki thikaanon ko nishaanaa banaaya he
 So the question arises that on whom will Pakistan use its air force? Ajay Lele, who has been an Air Force officer himself, believes that air strikes are done to astonish in the face of non-conventional war
 chunki bharat ne kaha he ki usne gaiyr-sainya karrwai kii he, lihaaja pakistan apni vayusena kaa istemaal kis tareeke se karegaa yah dekhnaa hoga
 While Ajay Sahni believes that the strength of Pakistan Air Force is not equal to that of India but it is definitely two-thirds
 uske hathiyaar bhi nae hai
 Ajay Sahni believes that the Pak Air Force can attack without entering the Indian border, it has the potential
 saahani kaa kahana he ki bhartiya vayusena bhi paak seemaa main daakhil hue bina is hamale ko anjaam de sakati thi
 But the reason behind entering Pakistan was to give the message that India can penetrate into your border and attack with precision
 kutnithik morche par bharat kii gherebandipulavama hamale ke baad antarrashtriya samudaay main pakistan kii chautarafa ninda hui thi
 In its retaliation, India has entered Pakistan's occupied Kashmir border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and attacked in Balakot
 ajay lele kaa maananaa he ki pakistan antarrashtriya manch par apni samprabhutaa par hamale kaa hawala degaa
 It could also be that Pakistan does nothing for a few days and accuses India of waging war

 Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said in his press briefing that he had also spoken to representatives of OIC countries
 yahaan gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki bharat ne pakistani sena ko nishaanaa nahin banaaya, balki aatanki thikaanon par prahaar kiya he
 In such a situation, Pakistan is unlikely to get sympathy on this front too
 kyonki jo kaam bharat ne kiya antarrashtriya samudaay vahi kaam pakistan ko apane mulk main karne ko kahata rahaa he
 So now the entire focus is expected to shift to the United Nations, where in the Security Council India has proposed to declare Jaish chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist
 lekin china kaa vito bharat kii raah main rode atka rahaa he
 Limited military strikership expert Ajay Sahni says that Pakistan has options open to carry out military strikes within a limited range

 ' By the curse of God, Holika was burnt to ashes after taking Prahlada in her lap
 ye baat sabhi jaanate hai, lekin ye baat bahut kam logon ko pataa hogi kii holikaa kii maut ke baad uskaa mangetar tah umrah kuwara rahaa
 To fulfill the desire of Holika's fiancée, a special class of people still carry out her procession with pomp
 
 
 
 This is why it is granted that there is a temple of Holika's fiance in Salahayapur to wear onyx gems in the spring, which opens only in the month of Phagun, then its doors are closed throughout the year
 mandir ke pat khulne or band hone kii ek khaas parampara yahaan nibhaai jaati he
 It is believed that if the couple who do not have children, such couples pray in this temple, then their wishes are fulfilled
 bhale hi yah baat ascharyajanak lagati ho, par yah baat satya maani jaati he
 There are hundreds of people who appreciate it
 holashtak ke maukey par nathuram kii baraat dhoomdhaam ke saath nikaali jaati he
 The temple of Nathuram opens on a special date and occasion three to four days before Holika Dahan
 iske baad bataur aarti kai tarah kii rasm adaayagi hoti he
 The temple is decorated daily in his court every night
 isamen badi sankhya main log shaamil ho kar phag gaate hai
 There is also a lot of laughter
 iske baad tay samay aam shaadi byaah main nikalne vaali baraat kii tarah nathuram kii baraat nikalati he
 People involved dance and sing dancing
 log bataate he ki aatishbaajee or baaje gaaje se nikalne vaali ye baraat kisi aam shaksh kii nahin balki itihaas ke panno me darj us shaksh kii hoti he, jo holikaa ke saath vaivaahik jivan kii door me bandhana chahta tha
 But a few days before her marriage, she got the gift of her gift to Holika, which was given to her by Brahma
 prahlaad ko god me lekar holic agni me baith gai, taaki wo use maar sake
 But the opposite happened, Holika herself got burnt by the curse of God
 is shraap se nathuram kii holikaa se shaadi kii hasarat adhuri kii adhuri rahi
 Therefore, the devotees of Nathuram take out their procession in the month of Phagun to fulfill that incomplete Hasrat
 ye shaadi sirf naach gaanaa or mouj masti kaa hissaa hi nahin hoti balki saalo puraani ek aisi parampara he jo aaj bhi nibhaai ja rahi he
 People of Marwar region of Rajasthan especially have their presence in the temple of Nathuram
 is maukey par nibhaai jane vaali rasm adaayagi main wo bad chadh kar hissaa lete hai
 According to the priest of this temple, Jeevan Lal, this tradition has been going on for many generations
 wo bataate he ki nathuram ke bhakt pure desh main faile hue hai
 Nathuram's temple in Raipur is several years old
 ye mandir saal main ek baar phaguna kii ekadshi ko khulata he or poornima main iske pat band ho jate hai
 a unique ritual begins here as soon as the temple opens
 phaguna kii ekadshi ke din, aarti ke baad dulhe kaa shringaar kar baqayada baraat nikaali jaati he
 People greet each other by applying gulal-abir
 is baraat main shaamil hokar log khud ko bhaagyashaalee samajhate hai
 Reconciliation is given to the processions
 halava pudi se lekar tamaam swadist vyanjan unhen parose jate hai
 People have a lot of faith and belief in Nathuram
 koi unhen bhagwaan shankar ke rup main puujata he to koi mahaan sant ke rup main
 Although people of all religions and sects are devotees of Nathuram, but those who worship them are more than the people of Marwar in Rajasthan
 mandir se nikalne vaali nathuram kii baraat kaa yahaan 187 varshon kaa itihaas aaj bhi maujuud he

 vahiin, jetali ne ek baar phir yah saaf kaha ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi or varisht netaa laal krishna adwani ke bich koi maamla nahin he
 Apart from this, he says that along with the discussion on the upcoming assembly elections, the issue of corruption was discussed
 unka kahana he ki party yah maanati he ki aatankwaad kuch samay baad phir ubhara he
 He said that arrogance has become involved in the working of the government
 or saaf dikhaai de rahaa he ki piem kaa aatmavishvaas kam ho rahaa he
 The BJP believes that the government will not last very long
 jetali ne kaha ki bhaajapa ek vaikalpik sarkaar ke liye taiyaar hogi
 He also called on the UPA to hit the ax on his leg
 haalanki philhal party main chal rahaa andruni kalah hi netaaon ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab bana hua he
 The biggest reason for the problem is the non-existence of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi in the meeting and no leader is avoiding saying anything openly on this
 sushamaa swaraj ne sawaal ko ansuna kar diya to vahiin ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki party main ekta he
 Significantly, the meeting of the National Executive is being held at a time when there are reports of tension between Modi and Advani
 ummid he ki aaj adwani is baat kaa elaan karenge ki wo piem pad ke daavedaar nahin hai
 However, some party leaders are still in favor of Advani
 vahiin baithak main aae kai bhaajapa netaaon ne modi ke naam ko aage badhaayaa he to kuch ne vakt ke intazaar kii baat kahi he
 According to sources, Modi had opposed the Advani Rath Yatra to begin in Gujarat, then Advani announced his journey from Bihar which would be flagged off by Nitish Kumar
 aaj kii baithak main adwani kii yatra par bhi charchaa hone kii puri sambhaavna he
 BJP leader LK Advani will begin his rath yatra from Bihar on 11 October
 maharashtra ke logon tak pehali baar wo 17 aktubar ko nagpur pahunchenge
 His chariot will be taken to Pandharkavada on 18 October
 vahaan se wo andhra pradesh chale jaaenge
 Advani will reach Goa on November 1
 vahaan se do november ko ek baar phir wo konkan ke banda main pravesh karenge phir kolhapur jaaenge
 Advani's chariot will reach Pune on November 3, while on November 4, he will arrive in Mumbai
 mumbai se adwani gujarat kii taraf kooch kar jaaenge
 Sonali Bendre was diagnosed with high-grade cancer in July last year
 iske baad unhone neuyork main apana medical treetment karaayaa
 She has now returned to India after treatment
 lekin abhi ve cancer free nahin hui hai
 On the second day of the 18th edition of India Today Conclave, the actress gave the biggest interview for her battle with cancer for the first time
 behad bhavuk kar dene vaale seshan The Empress of Maladies: How i beat cancer
 What it taught me was moderated by Shoma Chaudhary, Senior Journalist
 seshan ke dauraan kai baar aise pal aae jab apni cancer jarney par baat karte hue sonaali bhavuk ho gayi
 Sonali had to have her hair removed during the chemo treatment
 isse jude shoma ke sawaal par actress ne kaha- ''ab mere bal chote ho gaye hai
 Yes, it definitely has an advantage, i take less time to prepare now
 main khud ko positive rakhti hum
 i say to myself, no problem if i don't have hair
 sharir badal gaya he, lekin koi baat nahin
 I'm not a little comfortable right now, but i will
 ""main inparfections main bhi main khubsuurati dhundh luungi
 When earlier my hair was long, many things were hidden
 lekin ab aisa nahin he
 Face was also hidden due to long hair
 lekin ab sab saamne he
 Full face is visible
 ab kuch nahin chup saktaa
 '' View this post on instagramseems like we have a recurring theme on @sonalisbookclub! To continue with stories where people have faced challenges of varying degrees, our next book is a little novella that influenced me tremendously
 It made me think and wonder and feel very very deeply
 Sometimes a little unknown book does all the magic! The next book for # SBC is 'jet Lag' by Ann Birstein
 Since it's a short one, we'll have the discussion at the end of this month
 See you then! # sbcbookdiscussiona post shared bysonali Bendre (@iamsonalibendre) onfeb 17, 2019 at 10:34 pm PST Sonali says that her hair and face are very important for an actress, model
 bakaul sonaali, ''maine apane kariyar main har hair product ko endorse kiya he
 Hair and looks have been my source of income
 maine apni girl team ko apni beemaari ke bare main bataaya
 i told him that now i do not know whether i will be able to come back or not
 lekin unhone mujhe hausala diya
 Made me positive ''view this post on instagramworld Cancer Day


 who would have thought it would become such a thing


 but it has! And just the mere mention of the c word brings dread in the hearts of anyone who hears it
 We fear it so much that we'd rather not talk about it


 which is why it's important to have a day where we pull out the band aid and help us deal with this disease
 i was scared too, but soon realised that burying my head in the sand was not the way to deal with this
 And so


 with the little experience i have had, i urge you all to take the time to understand it
 There's more to cancer than being emotional or weak or even being called a fighter or a survivor
 It requires you to study it, find out what works for you and to be diligent about your treatment
 It requires days of strongly believing in oneself, of knowing that tomorrow will be better than today
 It is not a fight against negative thoughts
 It's taking a stand to not give in, no matter what
 Most importantly, it is about living every day, and not just surviving
 Just taking it # onedayatatime makes it easier to # switchonthesunshine

 bhartiya cricket prabandhan main ek baar phir vichaaron main matbhed kii baat jagajaahir hoti dikh rahi he
 Vikram Rathore has been appointed as the batting coach of india-a and Under-19 teams, where a conflict of interest has arisen
 rathod under-19 team ke chayankarta ashish kapur ke rishtedaar hai or yaheen ek baar phir hiton ke takaraav kaa pech funs gaya he
 There are also reports that Director General (cricket Operations) Saba Karim had suggested Rathore's name to Vinod Rai, the head of the Committee of Administrators (COA)
 udhar, bhartiya cricket control board (bisisiai) ke kaaryvahak sachiv amitabh choudhary ne ek patr likhakar is par aapatti jataai he
 a copy of the letter is with IANS, alleging that Rahul Dravid's name has been misused in the entire process
 isse bhi zyada choudhary ne kaha he ki lambey samay tak bhartiya cricket par adhikaar jamaane vaale jameendaar ek baar phir bhartiya cricket main vaapasi karnaa chaahate hai or ise apane tareeke se chalaanaa chaahate hai
 In a letter to BCCI Chief Executive Officer Rahul Johri, Chaudhary has said whether the decision to appoint a uk-based india-a team batting coach was taken unanimously? Unhappy over the appointment of Rathore, Chaudhary has said that he is not aware of any commercials given for the appointment of this post
 unhone likhaa, 'maine media main ai us khabar ko dekha, jisamen vikram rathod ko india-e kaa ballebaaji coach niyukt karne kii baat kahi gai he
 i was surprised to see this, because i did not see any commercials for this post anywhere
 ek or mudda main yahaan uthaanaa chaahunga wo he vigyaapan prakriya ko nazarandaaj karne kaa
 'he wrote,' What was the process that was adopted? Who first said that a batting coach is needed (when a person like Rahul Dravid is the coach there) and who suggested the name of Vikram Rathore? Knowing Rahul, i can say that if he had suggested the name, he would not have said that the procedure should not be followed for the appointment of Vikram
 'patr main likhaa he, 'maine dekha he ki media main hiton ke takaraav kaa maamla bhi saamne aayaa he or chunki hiton ke takaraav kaa mudda beete dhai saal se saarvajanik he, aise main main is baat se hairaan hum ki is bare main us insaan ko nahin pataa, jisane yah faisla liya
 Taking forward his allegations, the Acting Secretary has written that Karim and Vikram worked together as selectors and it is difficult to forget this
 choudhary ne apane patr main kaha he ki bhaibhatijawad saamne he
 He wrote, 'saba Karim and Vikram Rathore have served as national selectors for four years
 main is baat par vishwaas nahin kar paa rahaa hum ki is baat kaa pataa kisi ko nahin tha
 Also, Vikram has a UK passport, so was the decision to appoint a foreign coach unanimously taken? 'chaudhary wrote that he tried to talk to Karim via phone and message, but he failed are
 is maamle main dilachasp baat yah he ki bisisiai kaa kaamkaaj dekhne ke liye niyukt kii gai sioe ke adhyaksh raay ne kaha he ki vikram kii niyukti main puri tarah se prakriya kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 Chaudhary wrote, 'has that person been appointed? See if i appoint a bank chairman, then i will investigate first and after that i will recommend his appointment
 isliye unke vivaadaaspad bayaan par gaur kiya janaa chahie or aaj yah saamne aayaa ki kuch bhi galat nahin hua tha, jo baat myne rakhti he wo yah he ki kya unhone sahi kaha or mana ki vah kapur ke rishtedaar hai
 The code of conduct officer then had to decide whether it was a conflict of interest or not
 'vikram rathod kii niyukti par rokudhar, bharat e or under-19 team ke ballebaaji coach ke rup main niyukti par hiton ke takaraav kaa maamla prashaskon kii samiti (sioe) ke sangyaan main laane ke baad roak laga di gai he
 Rathore was to begin his tenure with india-a in Wayanad, but now his appointment has been suspended indefinitely
 bisisiai ke ek varisht adhikari ne gopneeyata kii shart par pitiai se kaha, ‘haa, sioe ne rathod kii niyukti ko manjuuri de di thi, lekin rathod ne kapur ke saath apane sambandhon ke bare main likhit ghoshnaa kii
 He said, "the matter was discussed with (COA chief Vinod) Rai and it was concluded that only the moral officer can decide whether Rathore's interest in working with the Under-19 team during the quadrennial series interests Is similar to a collision
 ’bisisiai main naitik adhikari nahin he or isliye mana ja rahaa he ki rathod kii niyukti se galat sandesh jayega
 The official said, 'the appointment letter has not been signed
 sabaa kareem ne hi rahul dravid kii sifarish par unki niyukti kaa faisla kiya tha,’bharat-e ke coach dravid rathod ko bharat e or under-19 team se jodna chaahate the, lekin bisisiai ke cricket sanchaalan mahaprabandhak sabaa kareem ne sambhavit hiton ke takaraav ko lekar sioe ko avgat nahin karaayaa
 There has been a split in the UPA after investigating the espionage case
 congress ne sahyogi dal ensipi or neshnal conference maujuuda upie sarkaar dwaara kamity ke liye jaj kii niyukti ko galat tehraaya he
 Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah tweeted that it would be wrong to set up an inquiry committee at the last moment of UPA 2's term
 mere pitaaji bhi aisa hi maanate hai
 Was talking to my dad last night & he felt the same way - setting up a commission of inquiry in the dying hours of UPA 2 is just wrong
 — Omar Abdullah (@abdullah_omar)may 4, 2014isse pehle, media main aisi report ai thi ki ensipi netaa prafull patel ne bhi congress ke is kadam ko galat thaharaaya he
 Now it has to be seen whether the Congress postpones this decision after the opposition from the peers
 congress kaa aarope he ki kathith taur par gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi or unke kareebi sahyogi amit shah ke ishaare par ek yuvati kii avaidh jasusi karai gai

 'centre sarkaar ne jahaan maamle kii jaanch ke liye ritair jaj kii adhyakshata main ayog gathit kiye jane kii ghoshnaa kii vahiin bijepi ne kaha he ki antim samay main buree niyat se liye gaye kisi bhi faisle ko agali sarkaar nahin dhoegi

 Anyway, if this punishment will not be implemented in the case of the murder of 250 people, then when and if it will be brought

 In religious beliefs that deeply affect our conscience through moral teachings, the glory of forgiveness is greater than punishment

 Such instances are less likely to be described when the glory of imprisoning the captive for a long time and later being given the death penalty
 thande dimag se kiye gaye katl ko bhartiyata main hameshaa nichi nigaah se dekha gaya he
 Memories of i Gauri and Chauhan Here i am reminded of the incident of Prithviraj Chauhan and Muhammad Gauri
 aitihaasik taur par pehali ladaai chouhan ne jiti or gauri bhaag niklaa, vahiin duusari ladaai gauri ne jiti or chouhan maare gaye
 But Lok woven this historical fact in his mind differently
 vahaan prithviraj chouhan saat baar mohammad gauri ko haraate hai or har baar use maaf kar dete hai
 At the same time, when Gauri wins for the eighth time, he keeps Chauhan in captivity and kills him mole
 or climex main ankhen phod die jane ke baavjood zanjeeron main jakade raay pithora shadbradabhedi bann se gauri ko maar giraate hai
 Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in his book 'story of Hindustan' has explained this incident in this way - a history is one in which a recorded event takes place
 doosraa itihaas lok itihaas hota he, isamen asal itihaas ke bajaay ghatana kaa vah varnan hota he jisamen lok kii tamanna pratibimbit hoti hai
 Lok wanted to show his hero as brave, kind and victorious as Chauhan and he did so
 nehru ji ke mutabik asli itihaas kii tulana main lokman main ghatit yah kaalpanik itihasasamaajon kaa bhavishyatay karata he
 That is, Indian society considers Chauhan who forgives Gauri seven times as brave and noble, if not a foolish and unskilled strategist, because forgiveness and generosity is a bigger thing than punishment and revenge in Indian society
 lekin aaj yaqub memon kii faansee ke vakt yah hajaar saal purana prasang hamaari kitni madad kar paaegaa? kyonki bombai bam cond kaa doshi memon na to chouhan kii shrenee main aata he or na hi gauri kii
 And to argue at this time that the Babri Masjid demolition of four months back was also against the backdrop of the Bombay bombings and some of the tainted Babri scandals are sitting in positions like Union Minister and Governor today is also meaningless
 aakhir koi faisla to antim hona tha
 
 
 The hanging of Yakub had become inevitable because if he had not been there, the credibility of the Supreme Court and constitutional bodies like the President would also come under doubt
 aakhir koi faisla to antim faisla hona hi tha
 a nation was punishing this guilty to its culprit, not a person, to a person

 On such difficult occasions, the nation hardens like a machine
 lekin janata aisa nahin kar sakati
 Because of all kinds of excess, anorexia is another major feature of Indianness

 Society starts thinking that what happened is what happened

 Is the culprit of 20 years ago still equally dangerous? agar use jinda chhod denge to kya gajab ho jayega
 a better nation would save its subjects from this inhuman wonder
 use koi jarurat nahin thi ki faansee kii sajaa kii itane pehle se ghoshnaa karata
 Then he would have a sensational debate on TV for a fortnight
 ise ek mahaan rashtravaadi jashn yaa ek madhyayugin barbarta ke taur par prachaarit kiye jane ke vikalp khule chodta
 The nation should have operated it silently like a boil, so that when people would open the TV someday, there would be a sudden news that a criminal was hanged
 tab logon ke man main yah anaavashyak aparadhbodh nahin hota ki ve subah tivi kholenge to apane aap hi ek raashtra niojit hatya ko rokane ke liye kuch nahin kar paane kaa aparaadh bodh khud par lad lenge
 Former Indian team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is known for his different style
 maidan par vah yuva khilaadiyon kii madad karte hai to maidan ke baahar bhi apane vyavhaar se prashansakon kaa dil jeet lete hai
 a similar incident happened again when Dhoni hugged and thanked his fan who came to touch his feet
 darasal dhoni aajkal cricket se dur hai or aagaamee IPL kii taiyaariyon main jute hai
 He was invited as a guest to an event where Dhoni was supposed to distribute prizes
 isi dauraan puraskaar lene stage par aayaa dhoni kaa ek yuva prashansak aakar sidhe unke pairon main gir padaa
 At this Dhoni immediately picked him up and hugged him, even Dhoni took a selfie with him
 dhoni kii yah dariyaadilii dekh samaaroh main maujuud sabhi logon ne jor-jor setaliyaan bajaanaa shurukar diya
 After this, Dhoni honored and sent the fan back
 lekin jate-jate phir usne dhoni ke pair chhu hi liye
 Watch the video here: During the Vijay Hazare Trophy match in Delhi, a fan of Dhoni came to the ground to touch his feet
 dhoni ne apane prashansak ko apana autograph bhi diya tha
 Recently, in a match against Sri Lanka in Mohali, a fan came to touch Dhoni's feet during the fielding break
 aisi ghatnaon se jaahir he ki desh or duniyabar main dhoni keprashansakon kii kami nahinhai
 The star player of Team India not only has the love of fans but also the teammates respect Dhoni's experience and his talent
 bataa den ki mahendra singh dhoni ko srilanka main yojit nidahaas trophy ke liye aaraam diya gaya tha or ab vah 7 april se shuru ho rahe IPL main chennai super kings kii captaini karte najar aaenge

 The bill proposes negative scoring on every offense and the license will be suspended after it has a negative score above one level

 According to the news of the Indian Express, the Election Commission will send the information to the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) in the next few days for further action on the parties who have canceled the recognition
 ye aseraajnneetik dalhem jinhone 2005 se ab tak koi chunaav nahin ladaa he or inkaa astitv mahaj kaagajon par he
 Election Commission officials fear that many such political parties are being used for money laundering

 According to the current law, all political parties have to mention only the source of the amount above Rs 20,000 in their income tax return
 iskaa phayda uthaate hue raajnneetik dal apana zyaadaatar chanda 20,000 rupye se kam main hi dikhaate hai or is tarah unhen iskaa strot nahin bataanaa padataa

 ek safal shaadi kaa sapana har marid kapal dekhtaa he
 But many times - accidentally, by making many such mistakes, your dream can be broken in a moment
 ek safal shaadi aapaki jindagi se jude baaki sabhi rishton parfect bana sakati he
 However, it is not easy to keep married life happy forever
 iske liye purushon ko apni 5 aisi aadaton main badlaav laane chahie jo unke rishte main daraar laa sakati he
 Let's know what those 5 habits are
 vakt kaa khyaal rakhenshaadi se pehle bhale hi aap apane doston ke saath ghanton samay bitaate ho,lekin ab aapkaa aisa karnaa aapaki patni ko pareshaan kar saktaa he
 Organize your time, while making time for friends, do not forget to give quality time to your wife too
 ghar ke kaam main haath madad karenghar ke sabhi kaamon kii jimmedaari patni par daalane se ho saktaa he ki unke paas aapke liye bhi uchit samay na nikaal paaen
 In such a situation, to make your relationship a little romantic and strong, be a little generous and help the partner's kitchen
 aapke aisa karne se yakeen maniye unki najaron main aapke liye izzat or bad jaaegi
 Be sure to praise
 Most men stop praising their wives as soon as they marry
 jisaki vajah se kai baar unka rishta boring hona shuru ho jaataa he
 In such a situation, in order to make your partner feel special, immediately give them two words of praise
 aisa karne se aapaki patni ko acha mahasoos hone ke saath unka aatmavishvaas bhi bad jayega
 Leaving no chance to impress
 Shaadi does not mean that you stop impressing your partner
 chaahate hai pyaar main pehle din jaisaa romance bana rahe to shaadi ke baad bhi samay-samay par unhen special feel karavaaen
 Sometimes pull the chair to sit for them, sometimes open the car door for them as before
 aisa karne se aapaki patni ko kabhi yah mahasoos nahin hoga ki ab aap unase pehle jaisaa pyaar nahin karte hai
 Do not give respect to other
 Many men feel that their decision is right or wrong but as a partner, their partner should accept everything they say
 aise log jivan se jude saare nirnay khud hi lenaa chaahate hai
 Honoring partner's views is not included in their list
 agar aap bhi aisa hi kuch karte hai to yaad rakhen is sthiti ko bhale hi kuch samay ke liye najrandaaj kar diya jaae, par aise rishte taumr nahin tikte
 Companies are happy with the work of their employees and give them bonuses at home, branded clothes, cars, foreign trips, rupees etc
 lekin ek chinis company in sab chizon ko peeche chhodte hue apane sarvshereshth karmchaariyon ko bonus main kisi porn star ke saath ek raat bitaane kaa mauka de rahi he
 The company, called the Internet security firm Kiho 360 on Chinese New Year, gives employees a chance to spend a night with a discount, Porsche car or porn star
 yah porn star 27 saal kii julia hai jo china main kaaphi prasiddh hai
 Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray has clarified that he has not criticized Narendra Modi for the Uttarakhand tour
 unhone kaha ki modi se desh ko bahut zyada ummid he
 Uddhav said that what we have said in today's article is our expectation
 prachaar karne waalon se hamane kaha he ki modi ji ne jo acha kaam kiya he, usko aap sankuchit na karen
 If he is working or wants to do for the whole country, then bring the same image to the people
 darasal, aaj 'saamana' main uddhav thakare ne modi ke uttarakhand daure par sawaal uthaae the
 Uddhav Thackeray has written that Modi did not do well just by talking about Gujaratis
 vah desh ke netaa hai or unhen sabaki baat kerani chahie
 According to the Shiv Sena, those campaigning for Modi should understand that help in national disaster is religion, not favor
 aise maukon par majahab nahin dekha jaataa, kshetreeyata nahin dekhi jaati
 By the way, the Shiv Sena had also raised the question on Monday, where will the NDA get new partners? ’saamana’ main shivasena ne likhaa he, modi ab aap desh ke netaa bane hai or sirf gujaratiyon ko bachaane kaa daawa karnaa sahi nahin
 Such publicity is harmful for you
 aap se ab rashtriya bhaavana se kaam karne kii ummid he
 In the national disaster, what kind of religion, what kind of regionalism, ITBP did not make any such discrimination in its defense
 tippaniyan The Chief Minister of Maharashtra did not do such discrimination
 unhone apane rajya ke logon ko bachaaya, saath hi auron kii bhi madad kii
 This is Marathi Bana
 unhone aage likhaa, modi kaa piaar karne vaale ek baat samaj len
 Stop saying that Modi only saved Gujaratis
 yah modi kii chhavi ke liye thik nahin
 This left the Congress without a chance to hide its own failure
 modi ke piaar karne vaale yaad rakhen ki rashtriya aapadaa main madad dharm he, meharbaani nahin
 The Shiv Sena is also helping in its own way, as our heart is Hindustani
 uddhav ne kaha ki hamane aaj ke lekh main jo kaha he, vah hamaari apeksha he
 We have told the campaigners that you should not narrow down the good work that Modi has done
 puure desh ke liye agar vah kaam kar rahe hai yaa karnaa chaahate hai to waisi chhavi ko logon ke saamne laaen
 In fact, in 'saamana' today, Uddhav Thackeray questioned Modi's visit to Uttarakhand
 uddhav thakare ne likhaa he ki modi ne sirf gujaratiyon kii baat karke thik nahin kiya
 He is the leader of the country and he should talk to everyone
 shivasena ke mutabik, modi kaa prachaar karne waalon ko samajhnaa chahie ki rashtriya aapadaa main madad dharm he, meharbaani nahin
 Religion is not seen on such occasions, regionality is not seen
 vaise, somvaar ko bhi shivasena ne yah sawaal uthaaya tha ki endie ko nae saathi kahaan se milenge? In 'saamana', Shiv Sena has written, Modi has now become the leader of the country and it is not right to claim to save only Gujaratis
 aisa prachaar aapke liye hanikaarak he
 AAP is now expected to work in the national spirit
 rashtriya aapadaa main kaisaa dharm, kaisaa praantvaad, itibipi ne apane bachaav main aisa koi bhedbhaav nahin kiya
 The comments maharashtra ke mukhyamantri ne aisa bhedbhaav nahin kiya
 He saved the people of his kingdom, as well as helping others
 yah he, marathi bana
 He further wrote, Let the PR of Modi understand one thing
 yah bataanaa band karen ki modi ne sirf gujaratiyon ko bachaaya
 This is not good for Modi's image
 isse congress ko khud kii vifaltaa chupaane kaa mauka bevajaah mil gaya
 Those who do Modi's PR remember that help in national disaster is religion, not kindness
 shivasena bhi apane tareeke se madad kar rahi he, kyonki hamaara dil hindustani he

 purv bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni in dinon ipel main pune kii ore se khilne main vyast hai
 On Sunday evening, Dhoni shared a short video on his Instagram account, in which he is seen trembling
 video aplod hone ke baad se hi lagaataar viral ho rahaa he
 Actually, this video is of an Ed shot for the IPL, in which Dhoni is seen dancing with other players of the team
 a post shared by @mahi7781onapr 9, 2017 at 8:51am pdtabi tak pune ke khele gayi do maichon mendhoni koi khaas kamalanhin dikhaa paye hai, pehle match main jab vah ballebaaji karne aaye the to match main zyada kuch nahin bachaa tha
 So in the second match, Dhoni was able to score very few runs
 gambhir ko bivi se daant kaa daraisse pehle gautam gambhir ne bhi ek intervyuu main bataaya tha ki unke ipel ke aid main dance karne ke kaaran unki bivi unki pitayee kar sakati he
 Gambhir had said that he never dances in any function, even at the behest of Shahrukh Khan
 par aid ke liye unhen thirakna hi padaa
 Hi Sachin! i am also among your millions of fans
 aapane cricket se sanyas lene kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 You played well for yourself and your country
 cricket kaa matlab hota tha aapaki ballebaaji ko dekhnaa
 See your shot
 sachin he to khel he
 Sachin is not good for bowlers
 sachin he to score kii kami nahin
 If Sachin is cricket then cricket main aapane kai kirtiman banaae jo shaayad hi koi tod paae
 There are several reasons for this
 pehla to yah ki ab shaayad hi kisi khilaadi kaa kariyar itnaa lanbaa ho or doosraa shaayad hi koi khilaadi aapaki tarah vivaadon se pare rah paae
 Keep trying continuously and do not lose courage
 You have taught not only many players but also to us
 aapane tab bhi apane aap ko sambhala jab aap shikhar par the or us samay bhi aapane apane sanyam ko barkaraar rakhaa jab aap nahin chal paa rahe the
 You also worked to silence critics from time to time with your bat
 cricket ke bhagwaan, master blaster, ran mashin jaise tamaam jumalon main jinda rahane vaale aap cricket ke kai chehron se kaaphi alag rahe hai
 Those who did not like cricket used to see it because of you
 apane bacchon ko log sachin se sikh lene kii kehete
 Now you will not be seen running with a bat in the cricket ground
 kaich lapakate nahin dikhenge or naa hi apane sahyogi khilaadi ko samajhaate najar aaenge ki kaise aakhri over main gend daale
 Despite all these things, your passion and longing to keep moving forward gave courage to people
 haalanki koi doosraa aap jaisaa nahin ban saktaa, lekin aapaki lagan or mehnat se sikh to saktaa hi he
 Hopefully in the coming times, you will be seen again in front of us in some other form

 abhi kuch din pehle hi jharkhand ke mukhyamantri raghuvar das ne padosi bihar main hue 'merit ghotaale' ke masale par tanj kasate hue vahaan ke chaatro ko jharkhand main aakar pariksha dene ko kaha tha
 But the report of a college in Dhanbad is showing a very disturbing picture of the education system in the state
 sthaneey govindpur ke ares mor college main ek hajaar se adhik chaatr lon main baithe dikhaai die
 They are seen sitting as a small study group of three and above and with their heads bowed down
 vastav main ve sab pariksha de rahe hai
 But no inspector showed there and was found to be openly copying
 yah seen mukhyamantri ke us daawey kii pole khol rahaa he jisamen ve kehete hai ki unke rajya main aisa kuch nahin hota
 The comments is sambandh main college prashasan kaa kahana he ki sabhi bacchon ko class main baitaane ke liye paryaapt kamare nahin hai
 According to him, a total of 600 students can sit in all the classes while in fact 1,664 students are appearing for the 11th class exam
 gauratlab he ki padosi rajya bihar main kuch samay pehle 'merit ghotaalaa' ujagar hua tha
 The students who topped 12th class were not aware of their subjects
 us silsile main pichley maheene bihar shiksha board ke pramukh, unki patni or ek anya vyakti ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 More than a thousand students were seen sitting on the lawn at RS More College in local Govindpur
 ve teen or usase adhik ke chote study group ke rup main baithe dikhaai de rahe hai or unke sir neeche jhuke dikhaai de rahe hai
 Actually they are all taking the exam
 lekin vahaan par koi bhi nireekshak nahin dikhaa or khuleam nakal hote pai gai
 This scene is revealing the claim of the Chief Minister in which he says that nothing like this happens in his state
 tippaniyan In this regard, the college administration says that there is not enough room to seat all the children in the class
 unke mutabik sabhi kakshaon main kul milakar 600 chaatr hi baith sakate hai jabaki vastav main 1,664 chaatr 11veen class kii pariksha de rahe hai
 Significantly, the 'merit scam' was exposed in the neighboring state of Bihar some time ago
 usamen 12veen class main top karne vaale chaatr apane vishyon se hi waakif nahin the
 In this connection, the head of the Bihar Education Board, his wife and another person were arrested last month
 vastav main ve sab pariksha de rahe hai
 But no inspector showed there and was found to be openly copying

 Before Mayawati, the campaign 'main Bhi Chowkidar' was further ridiculed by Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Party General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday
 rafel kaa mudda uthaate hue rahul gandhi ne kaha ki modi 'pakade' jane par puure desh ko chaukeedaar main badalane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai jabaki priyanka ne kaha ki chaukeedaar sirf amiron ke liye hai, garibon ke liye nahin
 Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said, 'what will he (prime Minister) wish, put next to his name
 mujhe ek kisaan bhai ne kaha ki dekhiye chaukeedaar to amiron ke hote hai, ham kisaan to apane khud chaukeedaar hote hai
 Priyanka said this after starting her election campaign in eastern Uttar Pradesh with the 'ganga Yatra' on the boat
 After BJP launch 'mai Bhi Chowkidar' campaign, PM Modi & others added the prefix 'chowkidar' to their Twitter handles
 So now Narendra Modi is Chowkidar & no more a 'chaiwala' which he was at the time of last LS election
 What a change India is witnessing under BJP rule
 Bravo! Rahul, who was targeting the Prime Minister with the slogan 'chowkidar Chor Hai' over alleged corruption in the Rafale fighter jet deal, said, 'the watchman was involved in the theft and when he was caught, the watchman said that the whole of India is the watchman is
 ' gandhi ne kaha, 'lekin pakade jane se pehle, puraa hindustan chor nahin tha
 The Prime Minister had said in his election rallies that he would work as a watchman against corruption
 bhaajapa dwaara congress ke hamale ke khilaaf shuru kiye gaye ‘main bhi chaukeedaar' abhiyaan main teji laae jane ke ek din baad rahul or unki bahan ne pradhanmantri ke khilaaf apane hamale tej kar diye hai
 Many leaders, including Modi and party president Amit Shah, have added the word Chowkidar to their names in their Twitter profiles as part of this campaign
 modi ke twitor acount profile main unki pahchaan 'chaukeedaar narendra modi' ke taur par dikhti he
 Rahul Gandhi said, 'when he became the Prime Minister, he said that don't make me Prime Minister, make me a watchman, remember you? He never said that he would make the whole of India a janitor
 ' gandhi ne uttari karnataka main party netaa mallikarjun khadge ke loksabhaa kshetra kalburgi main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'puraa desh jaanata he ki ‘chaukeedaar chor he'
 Gandhi said on Rafael, "modi and Ambani will go to jail if the documents become part of the investigation
" vah jaanch kyon nahin karvaa rahe? isaliye yah abhiyaan ‘chaukeedaar chor he'
 
 
 ' yadi pief khaaton main lagaataar 36 maheene tak yogadan na kiya jaae, to yah band ho jaataa he or ipiefo in khaaton main byaaj daalana band kar detaa he
