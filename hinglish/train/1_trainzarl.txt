 a plan in which a completely new gang was formed involving different people

 Not only this, after the incident, who would take the money, it was also decided beforehand
 or to or ye bhi plan kaa hissaa tha ki vaardaat ke baad sab alag-alag bhaagenge or koi bhi ek-duusare ko apane thikaane ke bare main nahin batayega
 That is, who did not know who is hiding with the amount of loot, even this gang of robbers themselves
 ye tarika isliye chunaa gaya taaki agar koi ek pakadaa bhi jaae to wo baakiyon kaa thikaana naa bataa sake
 Preparations had been going on for a month to carry out this loot
 planning itani jabardast thi ki sabase badi lut se pehle gang ne trial ke taur par ek choti lut ko anjaam diya
 Three different cars were looted on different days
 jin raaston par lut kii vaardaat ko anjaan dena tha un raaston par lage harek sisitivi camaron kii jaankaree nikaali

 Who came to Rajesh Kalra's house two months ago
 naukari par aane ke baad usne dekha ki rajesh kalra kaa manager rakesh akasar karodon rupee bag main lekar kalkaji se chandani chowk, conot place or karol baag ke liye car main jaataa he
 Many times that minor driver also went with Rajesh Kalra's manager and the rest of the attendants with money
 darasal rajesh kalra kaa kanat place ke do bank or karol baag ke do bank main khaataa or loker he
 The money was sent there to be deposited in the bank or kept in the locker
 iske alaava chandani chowk main bhi kai baar noton kii delivery hui
 The minor servant told this to Ajay, his maternal uncle's son, about a month ago while drinking alcohol
 ajay dilli ke madanagir main rahata he
 Ajay later told this to one of his relative Shakti
 shakti purana car chor he or kai baar jail ja chukaa he
 He has also gone to jail in connection with Bank Robery in 2002
 jail main hi shakti kii mulaakaat bahari dilli ke karaalaa ilaake main rahane vaale pradeep se hui thi
 Which is a small criminal
 pradeep kii haryana ke luteron ke kuch giroh se dosti thi
 So Pradeep also included some people from that gang in this plan
 is tarah kareeb aath-das logon kaa ek gang taiyaar hua
 Especially to carry out this loot
 gang taiyaar hote hi sabase pehle naaballig driver kii khabar par us puure root kii reki shuru hui jis root se rajesh kalra kaa paisa car main jaataa tha
 Before robbing Rajesh Kalra, the gang carried out a small robbery to buy more weapons as a trial
 chah janvari ko unhone okhla ke ek bijnesaman se 32 lakh rupee luute
 The money was later purchased with arms, to be used for large plunder
 gang ko lut ke liye gaadi kii bhi jarurat thi
 So on January 8, he looted an Innova car from Alipur
 magar baad main pataa chalaa ki car main kuch gadabadi he
 So on January 21, he stole a Verna car from Mundka
 phir 24 janvari ko jahangirpuri ilaake se ek wagon-aar car luti or phir mahangi jetta car churaai
 During this, Reiki's work was continuing
 bas intjaar tha to naaballig driver ke ishaare kaa
 And finally on the night of 27 January, the minor driver of Rajesh Kalra informed the gang
 khabar ye ki 28 janvari kii subah nau baje do bag main karodon rupee honda city car main le jaaya jayega
 After this, all the people of the gang reached near the house of Rajesh Kalra in Kalkaji in the morning in three cars i
e
 wagon-r, Verna and Jeta
 iske baad jaise hi honda city ghar se nikali teenon kaaron ne unka peechha karnaa shuru kar diya
 Finally at 9:25 am, they got the opportunity to stop Honda City by overtaking Moolchand flyover
 wagon-aar car ne overtek kiya or peeche se aa rahi verna main savaar badmaashon ne gan point par car main rakhe saare paise lut liye or car main savaar logon ko neeche utarkar usee car main vahaan se bhaag nikle
 Verna also went out with the robbers in the car
 wagon-aar car unhone vahiin chhod di thi
 The gang's third Zeta car was away from both the cars
 mauka-e-vaardaat se kareeb ek kilometre dur luteron ne verna car sadak kinare chhod di or saath aa rahi jetta car main baith kar vahaan se nikal liye
 After this, the jet car reached Kotla Mubarakpur directly
 honda city main savaar lutere bhi kotla mubarakapur pahunch gaye
 Now leaving Honda City on the same road, all the robbers now boarded the jet
 paise lekar vahaan se sidhe mahipalpur pahunche
 Money was distributed in Mahipalpur and then all the robbers escaped separately with money
 dilli police kii special cell ne ab tak is silsile main gang ke teen sadsy bholaa urf gulzaar, praveen or tinku ko giraftaar kar liya he
 Rajesh Kalra's minor servant is already in police custody
 baaki luteron kii talash ke liye lagaataar chaape maare ja rahe hai
 The case is almost solved
 teen lutere pakade gaye baaki pakad liye jaaenge
 But will the full amount of the loot be recovered? This question is because the robber himself is hiding information about the looted amount
 ab aise main jaahir he ye police par hi he ki baramadagi ke taur par kitni rakam dikhaati he
 However, the record of its Delhi Police regarding the seizures is not good
 28 sitambar 2012dephence colony, south dilli5 karod 25 lakh kii loottab ye dilli kii sabase badi lut thi
 Five crore 25 lakh rupees were looted from the bank's cash van at gunpoint
 baad main lutere pakade bhi gaye
 The amount of the loot was also recovered, but not completely
 balki chaar karod kuch lakh rupee, baaki kii rakam aaj tak nahin mili
 January 28 Lajpat Nagar, South Delhi: Fifteen crore looted from eight? On January 28, the old record of the biggest loot in Delhi was broken
 lut kii sajeesh kaa khulaasa ho gaya he, teen pakade bhi gaye
 The rest are expected to be caught soon
 par kya lut kii sari rakam waapas milegi? philhal sabase bada sawaal yahi he

 Manjhi is a leader who has been with the Congress, RJD and JDU in all three parties

 Along with Priyanka Gandhi's political entry, there were constant speculations about her entering the electoral fray
 varanasi loksabhaa seat par narendra modi ke khilaaf congress ne guuruuvaar ko ajay raay ko ummidavaar banaakar priyanka gandhi ke chunaav ladane ke saare kayaason par brake laga diya he
 However, there were loud discussions about Priyanka contesting in any of the Rae Bareli, Amethi, Allahabad, Phulpur and Varanasi seats
 aise main congress apane sabase bade trump card priyanka gandhi ko is chunavi ran main utaarne ke bajaay unka istemaal 2022 main upi main bade str par karegi
 The process of nomination for the last and seventh phase of Lok Sabha elections 2019 is going on
 baaki chah charnon ke namakan kaa daur puraa ho chukaa he
 In such a situation, the process of nomination has been completed in four of the five Lok Sabha seats where Priyanka Gandhi was contesting
 mahaj varanasi seat bachi he, jahaan 29 april tak namakan patr daakhil kiye ja sakate hai
 Meanwhile, Varanasi seat has also been approved by the Congress in the name of Ajay Rai, after which the suspense of Priyanka Gandhi contesting the Lok Sabha elections has ended
 philhal priyanka is chunaav main sirf party ke prachaar par focus karengi
 It is believed that there is a thought-out strategy behind not putting Priyanka Gandhi in the electoral fray of the Congress
 darasal congress uttar pradesh main 2019 loksabhaa chunaav se zyada 2022 ko lekar apni siyaasi jameen taiyaar kar rahi he
 After Priyanka's political entry and she was given the charge of Eastern UP, Congress President Rahul Gandhi also said that Priyanka has come not only for 'mission 2019' but for 'mission 2022'
 rahul ne kaha tha ki priyanka ko mishan diya gaya he ki upi main agali sarkaar hamaari hogi
 These things of Rahul mean that Priyanka will not only lead UP in the Lok Sabha elections, but up's 2022 assembly elections will also be fought under her leadership
 yahi vajah he ki congress priyanka gandhi ko loksabhaa chunaav ladaane kii bajaay vidhansabha chunaav main phul flash utaarne kii taiyaari main he
 Actually, the reason behind saying that the responsibility of UP as well as Priyanka for mission 2022 is the Congress's attempt to increase its existence in UP
 1989 ke baad se congress upi kii satta main kabhi nahin ai
 Now it is getting close to thirty years and the Congress is getting confined everyday in the largest state of the country
 upi main congress kii sthiti kharaab hone kaa asar centre main bhi congress ko dekhnaa padaa
 In the 1998 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress did not get a single seat
 1999 ke baad congress main jaan padi or 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main congress phir do seat par simat gai
 Not only this, even after the alliance with SP in the 2017 assembly elections, the Congress got just 7 seats
 priyanka gandhi ne maujuuda loksabhaa chunaav main vipakshi dalon ke diggaj netaaon ko party se joda or tikat dekar chunavi maidan main utaara he
 Apart from this, Priyanka has spoken to these leaders to fight the Lok Sabha elections as well as to give full strength in the 2022 assembly elections
 aise main saaf he ki congress ne apane trump card ko 2022 ke liye bachaakar rakh liya he
 At present, Priyanka Gandhi herself is working hard to win the Congress candidates in Uttar Pradesh by not getting into the field

 ) Ever since Kushal became homeless from Bigg Boss house, this issue is not taking the name of being quiet
 ek taraf to kushal ke phans chaahate hai ki kushal ko jald se jald big bos ke ghar main waapas laayaa jaae, vahiin kushal is baat se dukhi hai ki salmaan khan dwaar unase maafee maangane kii baat ko media main galat dhang se pesh kiya gaya
 In fact, Kushal had said that Salman had apologized to him, but on Saturday's weekend episode of Bigg Boss, Salman looked very angry
 unhone kaha, 'kushal halaat kaa phayda uthaa rahe hai
 i just apologized to him that what happened is a thing of the past, but Kushal is taking mileage of this matter
 'ab is puure maamle par safai dete hue kushal ne angreji akhbaar times of india ko ek intervyuu diya he
 According to him, 'everything i said was misinterpreted after Bigg Boss came out of the house
 ye sach he ki salmaan sar ne mujhase maafee maangi thi, lekin wo sirf mujhe chiyar-ap karne ke liye thi
 He said, "while at home, Salman told me on Saturday that my attitude towards Tanisha was not right and i should not have made personal comments about her weight, career and her sister
" main dukhi ho gaya tha, meraa cheharaa latak gay or main puure episod ke dauraan shant tha, tab salmaan sar ne mujhase kaha ki kushal tum mere bhai jaise ho or agar tumhen bura laga ho to main maafee maangata hum
 i told the exact same thing to everyone, but i do not know why everyone including the media is making so much hue and cry about this
 'kushal ke mutabik, 'salmaan sar ke khilaaf mere man main kuch nahin he
 i never said anything bad about him because he is not only my inspiration but i worship him
 wo salmaan hi hai jinhone mujhase kaha tha ki kushal main tum main ek star ko dekhtaa hum or tumhaara bhavishya bahut ujjwal he
 It means a lot to me
 salmaan ne sho ke dauraan hameshaa meri tarif kii

 guuruuvaar ko seemaa paar se hui alag-alag firing main 2 jawan shahid ho gaye
 a soldier was martyred in firing in Machil area of kupwara district on Thursday morning, then a captain was martyred in Rajouri in the evening
 jammu-kashmirake niyantran rekha ke paas rajouri jile ke sunderbani sector main aaj shaam 5 baje pakistan kii ore se firing shuru ho gai
 Two BSF jawan Prasenjit Biswas and Mansa Ram were injured in this firing
 donon ghayalon ko turant udhampur ke sena aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 However, Captain Prasenjit died during treatment
 isse pehle kashmir ghati ke kupwada jile ke machal ilaake main niyantran rekha parapakistani senaane yuddh viraam kaa ulanghan karte hue bhartiya sena kii chaukiyon par golibari kii
 a soldier of the Indian Army was martyred in the firing from Pakistan at 11 am
 bhartiya sena ne pakistan ke yuddh viraam ke ulanghan kaa munhtod jawaab diya
 Earlier on Wednesday, there has been tension on the Line of Control between India and Pakistan
 pakistani sena ne buudhvaar subah baraamula jile ke uri ilaake main seemaa se sate camel court main bhartiya chaukiyon par golibari kii thi jiske nattejey main bhartiya sena ke 2 jawan bhi ghayal hue the
 This series of shootings continued till late night due to which trade between Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistani occupied Kashmir was also stopped on Thursday
 niyantran rekha par bharat or pakistan senaaon ke bich hui golibari main kuch gharon ko nuksaan bhi pahunchaa he
 The loss of Pakistan in the firing from India is yet to be known
 lekin donon deshon ke bich niyantran rekha par tanaav bana hua he or aaj dinabhar uri ke saath-saath machhil sector main bhi golibari chalati rahi
 The Yogi government of Uttar Pradesh has brought an ordinance to make students patriots
 uttar pradesh nijee vishvavidhyalay adhyadesh naam ke is kanoon ke mutabik vishvavidhyalayon main agar raashtra virdohi gatividhiyaan huin to un par karrwai ho sakati he, unki manyata bhi khatre main pad sakati he
 The problem is that the ordinance does not state what the government's request is for anti-national activity
 yani sambhav he ki agar koi chaatr kavita pard rahaa ho to yah bhi raashtra virdohi gatividhi maan lee jaae
 If a student is arguing in favor of Pakistan in a debate competition, then it should also be put under the purview of anti-national activity
 or to or, rashtron ke banane yaa bikharane ko lekar class main chal rahi padhai bhi rashtravirohi gatividhi maani ja sakati he
 After all, the question may come in the mind of a student that if the nation goes through the historical process of formation and dissolution on the basis of political freedom, then how long India is a nation and how long it will remain
 uniwarsity yaa vishvavidhyalay shabd jinhone bhi banaae- sambhawatah vishvavidhyalayon kii isi prakruti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue banaae honge
 The centers of knowledge should be global - not only in their geographical spread, but also in their mental spread
 akhir ve rashtravidyalay nahin, vishvavidhyalay hai
 If it is mental spread and intellectual openness, then there will be a tendency to ask questions boldly in the universities and there will be no immediate political or social questions in their scope, even questions related to basic issues like religion, God, country, nation, faith
 Will be durbhaagya se bhartiya vishvavidhyalayon main hi nahin, puri bhartiya shiksha-samskruti main yah bauddhik khulaapan nahin he
 There is an emphasis on rote culture
 usamen parampara yaa guru yaa pustakon se arjeet gyaan ko ek mastishk se duusare mastishk main jamaa kar dena he
 Noted Brazilian educationist Paulo Frere has written a lot on this process
 aise maahaul main hamaare liye kalpana karnaa dushkar he ki koi aisa vishvavidhyalay ho jo buniyadi prashn uthaae or alokapriy hone kaa jokhim mol lekar bhi unke kuch buniyadi yaa vaikalpik uttar khoje
 JNU was possibly trying to become such a university
 vahaan chaatro or shikshakon ke bich samvaad kii prakruti rahi
 Of course, there too many teachers and students carry the knowledge and methodology acquired from the tradition on their back, but still there was some more openness
 magar iskaa nateeja kya hua? jeenyu ko deshadroh kaa adda bataaya gaya
 He was described as a piecemeal gang house
 bahut sambhav he, jeenyu ke khule maahaul main das-baarah chaatr aisi azaad tabiyat vaale hon jo bilkul desh or raashtra kii sarhadon ko na maanate hon
 In the same way, there will be ten-twelve such students who are so tied to the nation and country that they consider it to be paramount
 lekin in do siron ke bich alag-alag rangaton vaale kuch hazaar chaatr aise bhi honge jo sirf apane vishay or apane kareer se sarokaar rakhte honge
 After all, there is a huge queue of IAS officers from this university, which is considered to be the stronghold of Lal ideology
 is vishvavidhyalay ne ek taraf agar vam chetana se las kai andolankaaree paidaa kiye hai to nirmala sitaraman or es jaishankar jaise logon kaa bhi maanas banaaya he jo bijepi sarkaar ke sheershasth mantriyon main hai
 There is a fear that the openness with which all these colors come out may not end there either
 jeenyu main jo vivaad shuru hua tha, vah afazal guru kii smriti main kiye gaye ek aayojan se shuru hua tha
 a few days later, the then Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu raised the question that if an American university is organized in the memory of Osama bin Laden, will it be allowed? As the group of nationalists clapped on this question, then President of Princeton University Christopher L
 Eisgber said that they would not mind any such event
 unhone kaha, 'hamen ise sahan karnaa chahie or ham karenge
 This will cause a lot of uproar
 isko lekar log bahut naaraaz honge
 But we will not discipline anyone to make statements of this nature
 ' unhone kaha ki vishvavidhyalay aise kisi chaatr par anushaasan kii karrwai nahin karegaa
 If there is any objection, then they will definitely express their disagreement, but students will have the right to debate and schedule
 prinston uniwarsity ko maaloom tha ki chaatro kaa bauddhik vikaas isi tarah hota he
 The relaxation and habit of thinking at impossible angles creates the possibility of collusion of new horizons
 vakt or paripakvata ke saath sari vaicharik vakrataayen peeche chhot jaati hai
 If something remains, then they are also the beauty of the ideological society
 anyathaa baaki sab to vyavastha kaa poorja ho jane ko abhishpt ho jate hai
 In private universities, the risk of this openness was less than before
 vahaan amuman baari fees par bachche aise course karne aate hai jinase jaldi-jaldi naukari mil jaae
 They do not fall into unnecessary debates and taunt those students of JNU and other universities who continue to study for years
 aise maahaul ke bich yogi sarkaar kaa adhyadesh vishvavidhyalayon kii bachi-khuchi bauddhik sambhaavna par bhi kisi kulhadi kii tarah giregaa
 Universities will avoid any such creative venture that runs the risk of going beyond the idea prevalent in the name of nation and country
 lekin aise vaqt main yah kavita bhi khatarnaak he- ise padhanaa bhi rashtradroh ke daayre main aa saktaa he
 Private university students will also fear loop

 These were unknown people whom no one knows but people accepted the rumors which caused a lot of trouble

 Because rehearsals have to be done and prepared
 unhone kaha ki mere bare main yah bhi failaayaa gaya ki main logon ko sho ke set par intjaar karwaata hum joki bilkul galat he
 Kapil (kapil Sharma) said that someone said that i hit him by throwing a shoe, someone said that i expressed my displeasure about having food fast
 jabaki na to sunil ne kabhi aise aarope lagaae or na hi maine aisa sweekaar kiya
 According to Kapil Sharma, all these were concocted things, which was spread by a third and the fourth was written by an article and the fifth commented
 unhone sweekaar kiya ki mere khilaaf media main likhe ja rahe negative artical kii vajah se main depressant main chalaa gaya tha
 His son Narayan Sai has been embroiled in a new controversy after Asaram was sent to jail under judicial custody in a case of sexual exploitation of a minor girl

 chautaala ne kaha ki randhir singh ne desh or uske khilaadiyon ke khilaaf shadyantra rachaa
 Chautala alleged, 'randhir is a traitor
 usne desh or iske khilaadiyon ke khilaaf shadyantra kiya
 Being an IOC officer, he should have helped the country but due to personal selfishness he put the country in trouble
 ’unhone kaha, ‘yah desh ke liye kaala din he
 Holding Randhir responsible for the suspension of the IOA, Chautala said that the veteran sports administrator should resign from his post in the IOC immediately
 unhone kaha, ‘use turant apane pad se istipha de dena chahie
 He and the government are responsible for the current problem which led to the suspension of India
 ’chautaala ke mutabik, ‘or kal (buudhvaar) ham apni vashirk aam baithak main prastaav paarit karke randhir ke istife kii maang karenge
 He will not be part of the IOA again

 Jyotishacharya, a well-known Jyotishacharya and Dharmu Maharaj, trapped in a rape case with his own disciple, has come to light in a boarding school in the ashram and ashram in Pali
 rajasthan mahila ayog ne daati maharaj ke ashram kii jaanch main yah aniyamitataayen pain
 The Women's Commission says that no rules are being followed in the boarding schools and colleges in Dati Maharaj's Pali ashram
 daati maharaj ke ashram main chal rahe skool-collejon main barti ja rahi aniyamitata ko lekar rajya mahila ayog ne jila colector ko notice jari kar jawaab maanga he
 The Women's Commission says that the registration of schools and colleges running in the ashram has not been renewed for the last three years
 itnaa hi nahin skool or college ke liye bane chatravaason main rah raheen chaatraon ke bare main is tarah kaa koi record nahin he ki ve kahaan se taalluk rakhti hai
 Suman Sharma, chairperson of the Rajasthan Women's Commission, said that there is no record of how many girls are in the ashram
 ek notebook main keval sau ladakiyon ke naam darj the
 He said, "surprisingly, the girls' father's name is something else in the notebook and something else in the affidavit
 saath hi aayu sambandhit soochna bhi juthi maaloom pad rahi he
 Sharma said, "when my team went to the ashram, we found two people there, one of whom presented himself as Principal and the other as a cashier
 jab unase shiksha vibhaag kii enosi ke bare main poocha gaya to unhen is bare main pataa hi nahin tha
 No clear record of how she came from Anath girlshankahan and has been living here since
 skool, college or chatravaas kaa bhi koi record nahin mila
 She also said that the staff of the ashram did not even cooperate with the team of the Women's Commission which came to investigate
 mahila ayog ke mutabik, unhen daati maharaj ke ashram main chal rahe is skool main 151 ladakiyon ke hone kii baat pataa chali thi
 But when the women's commission team reached the ashram's school, there were 253 girls found on the campus
 mahila ayog kaa kahana he ki adhikansh ladkiyaan gujarat ke godhra or rajasthan ke udaipur se taalluk rakhti hai or adivasee samudaay se aati hai
 When the Women's Commission team wanted to talk to these girl students present in the campus, they were very scared and they changed the statements many times
 kabhi ve kah rahi thim ve 15 din pehle hi ashram ai thim, jabaki agali baar unhone bataaya ki unhen ashram aae 30 din ho gaye hai
 The women's commission team was also suspected due to repeated change of girl students
 jila colectorco likhe ek patr main poocha gaya he ki is ashram main record kii jaanch ke liye koi karrwai kyon nahin kii gai or saamaajik nyaay vibhaag ko in ladakiyon ko apni hiraasat main lene ke liye kaha gaya he
 The Women's Commission has sent its inquiry report to the concerned departments and sought a response in three days
 suman sharma ne kaha ki teen din tak ham jawaab kaa intjaar karenge or uske baad hamaara aglaa kadam kya hoga, is par faisla lenge

 kisaan ko desh kaa anndaata kaha jaataa he
 But it is not written to be rich in the fortunes of India's farmers who feed others
 kisaanon kii aatmahatya kii khabaren roj akhabaaron kii surkhiyaan bantorti hai lekin kisaan kii maut kii asal vajah kya he or kyon vah aatmahatya karne par majaboor hota he, ham aapako yahi bataane ja rahe hai
 'aaj Tak' has made an exclusive investigation and revealed the game of middlemen and profiteers by sticking it like a blood-sucking mite of farmers in the grain markets across the country
 lekin usase pehle yah samajhnaa jaruri he ki aakhir kisaan kaise in bichauliyon ke changul main funskar apana dam ghont detaa he
 The farmers take the crop to the mandi, where the farmers are used to make a deal to get the produce, which the government licenses
 achhatiyon ko aam bolchaal kii bhashaa main bichauliya kaha jaataa he
 Ardhati means middlemen get a deal between farmers and grain traders, in return for which they get commission at the rate fixed by the government
 kisaanon ko unki upaj kaa sahi daam mili, iske liye anaaj mandio main sarkaar ke nodel officer tainaat hote hai
 The government has currently fixed a minimum support price of 25 types of grains that cannot be purchased from farmers at a lower price
 kisaan kii fasal mandi main to aati he lekin use tay daam nahin miltaa or uski vajah he yahi munafkhor bichauliye
 The middlemen and government representatives together in government mandis create a cycle of profiteering in which farmers are forced to sell their crops at a price below the minimum support price
 empi ke muraina kii mandi main kisaan sarkari sarweyre se fasal kii kharid ke liye guhaar lagaate dikhe
 In fact, farmers from nearby areas brought mandi crops to the market to sell, but the government surveyor has rejected the entire crop of all the farmers
 fasal ke inspector ne bina jaanche parakhe hi puri mung fasal ko kharidne laayak nahin mana he
 This is the first phase of profiteering where the government surveyor in the market forces the farmers to sell their crop to traders outside the market
 isi ke chalate ab yah kisaan apni acchhee fasal ko bhi nunatam samarthan mulya se aadhi keemat par bechney ke liye majaboor hai
 It was revealed in the investigation of 'aaj Tak' that the condition of Pratapgarh Mandi in Rajasthan is also similar to Morena
 yahaan par bhi munafkhoron se pareshaan kisaanon kii fasal jab sarkari mandi main nahin bik saki to unhone apni fasal kisaarvajanik nilaamee laga di
 For this reason, the farmers here are forced to sell their garlic crop at a much lower price than the minimum support price of Rs 3200 per quintal
 fasal kaa nunatam samarthan mulya hasil karnaa kisaan kaa haq hota he
 Despite this, a network of intermediaries was seen in the government mandis of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan
 kisaanon kii is majaburi kaa ek or pahalu bhi he jahaan bainkon main bhi kisaan ko karj kaa kadava jehar pinaa padataa he
 Large reservoirs of weapons, petrol bombs, acid and mirchi bombs have been found inside the fort of Rampal such as the Satlok Ashram
 haryana police ke vishesh jaanch dal (esaiti) dwaara shuukravaar ko ashram kii talaashi ke dauraan hairaan karne vaale tathy saamne aae, jahaan ashram main rampal ke ek kaksh se lage kamare se garbh kii jaanch karne kaa upkaran bhi mila he

 The search team also found helmets and sticks and 20 pairs of black clothes and two tanks filled with 800 liter diesel
 ashram main chhipe hue teen logon kii pahchaan uttar pradesh ke badaayun ke jakhli nivasee yaadaraam, chhattisgarh nivasee ravi or bhivani nivasee ramesh ke taur par kii gai
 The ashram, which looks like a fort, has high walls and scaffolding for surveillance, while there is also a special room for private commandos and security personnel
 bade kshetra main faile ashram main kai jagahon par lage sisitivi camaron se nigaraanee kii vyavastha kii gai thi
 The air-conditioned rooms in the ashram can be compared to a luxurious hotel or form house, which also has bathrooms equipped with state-of-the-art equipment
 ashram main sthit satsang haul main 50,000 logon ke baithne kii kshamta he
 Rampal preached to followers from a bullet proof glass cabin
 pravaktaa ne bataaya ki talaashi abhiyaan kuch din or chalegaa, kyonki ashram bahut bade parisar main failaa he
 Two tanks of about 14 feet deep water will also be evacuated for complete search here
 newjiland kii ek adaalat ne bhartiya mul ke ek naagarik ko ek mahila or uski do varshiya beti kii hatya karne ke aarope main umrakaid kii sajaa sunai he
 According to the newspaper 'new Zealand Herald', Deepak Nagpal (24) was convicted by the court in 2010 for murdering a woman and her daughter
 adaalat ne nagpal ko kam se kam 20 varsh kaid kii sajaa sunai he
 According to the case, Nagpal had killed Ravneet Saga and his daughter Anna in the month of June 2010 with a knife
 ghatana ke do dinon baad maa-beti kaa shav baraamad kiya gaya tha
 It is noteworthy that at the time of this incident, Ravneet's husband Dev Saga was on a business trip to India
 notebandi ke baad pratibandhit kii gai 500 rupee or 1000 rupee kii note ko kamishan lekar badalane kii kai shaharon se shikaayat mili
 After this, the Income Tax Department has exposed many gangs in film style
 inakam tex department, mumbai ne apane kuch karmchaariyon ko puraani karency ko badalakar nai karency laane ke liye bheja
 These employees met a middleman who agreed to get a new note in exchange for an old note, taking a 35 percent commission
 bichauliye nenotbadalike liye graahakon ko apane ghar bulaayaa
 As soon as the middleman received the old note from them and asked them to wait for some time to give the new note, other officers raided the house
 is chaape main inakam tex department ne 29
 Seized a new currency of Rs 5 lakh
 bichauliye kii giraftaar ke baad baad inakam tex department ko pataa chalaa ki yah puraa giroh kai str par kaam karata tha
 In this work, many youths were employed at the grassroots level who used to search for people outside the bank or in the neighborhoods who had to replace small amount of old notes
 yah yuva in graahakon ko bichauliyon ke sampark main laate
 At the same time, he himself used to work in the name of himself, his family members and friends to withdraw new currency from the bank every day and handed over the currency of the money to the middleman on fixed commission
 vahiin giroh main jude sabhi yuva apane or apane jaanane waalon ke bank khate main bhi kamishan lekar puraani karency ko jamaa karne kaa kaam karte the
 At the same time, a gang has been caught in Nagpur to deposit a large amount of banned currency in fake account
 lagaataar mil rahi shikayaton ke baad jaanch karte hue inakam tex department ne paaya ki kuch aise logon ke bank khaaton main rupee jamaa karaae ja rahe hai jinhen pataa hi nahin ki ukt khaataa unka he
 7 cases of this kind came from Nagpur where this fraud of new and old currency was going on through fake bank accounts
 poochtacha par pachaa chalaa ki in sabhi bank khaaton ko 8 november ke baad kolkata main khulwaaya gaya tha
 At the same time, according to whose name the accounts were opened, he handed over the photocopy of his important documents to someone in Nagpur a few years ago
 is tarah nagpur meninakam tex departments pakade gai prati bank khaaton main 2-4 karod rupee jamaa karaane kaa bhandaphod kiya he
 At the same time, an interesting case has come from Ahmedabad

 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat said in Cuttack, Odisha on Sunday that if there are English people living in England, Germans living in Germany and Americans living in America, then why can't everyone living in Hindustan be Hindus 
 katak main ek kaarykram main bhagwat ne kaha, 'sabhi bharatiyon kii saanskrithik pahchaan hindutv he or desh main rahane vaale is mahaan saskruti ke vanshaj hai
 ' unhone kaha ki hindutv ek jivan style he or kisi bhi ishwar kii upasna karne vaala athwa kisi kii upasna nahin karne vaala bhi hindu ho saktaa he
 Quoting Swami Vivekananda, Bhagwat said that not worshiping a god does not necessarily mean that a person is an atheist, although one who does not believe in himself is definitely an atheist
 vahiin is khabar par pratikriya dete hue congress party ke netaa manish tiwari ne kaha ki bhartiya samvidhan main is desh ko india yaa bharat kaha gaya he, na ki hindustan
 This should be told to Mohan Bhagwat

 Meanwhile, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati has also asked Bhagwat to take knowledge of the constitution and then comment

 On 8 March, Salman's lawyer Ashok Mundargi requested the sessions court to hear both the trial of the actor and the order of the magistrate charged with culpable homicide
 abhinayta kii apil adaalat ne manjuur kar lee thi or yah maamla hezib ko saunp diya gaya 
 The actor has argued in his appeal that the magistrate made a mistake by accusing him of culpable homicide
 abhinayta ne magistrate kii is kaarywahi ko kanoon kii drushti main kharaab qaraar diya he
 The comments salmaan ke vakil ne daleel di ki magistrant yah dhyaan rakhane main vifal rahe ki uskaa iraadaa (salmaan kaa iraadaa) logon kii jaan lene kaa nahin tha or na hi use pataa tha ki uski tej raftaar or laaparvaahee se ek vyakti kii maut ho jaaegi athwa anya ghayal ho jaaenge
 On September 28, 2002, a land cruiser climbed on the footboard outside a bakery in Bandra, which Salman was allegedly driving
 isse ek vyakti kii maut ho gai or chaar anya ghayal ho gaye the
 Returning a day before the hearing of the case, there was speculation in the media that Salman would appear in court today
 satr nyaayalay ke nyaayadhish yubi hezib ne kaha ki vah pehle bandra magistrate ke aadesh ko chunauti dene vaali abhinayta kii apil par sunwaayee karenge
 The magistrate has charged Salman with culpable homicide not amounting to murder, which is far more serious and could carry a punishment of up to ten years if convicted
 salmaan ke varisht vakil ashok mundargi kii taraf se pesh hue ek vakil pesh hue or unhone chuninda dastavej daayar karne ke liye kuch samay maanga or adaalat ne sunwaayee do hafte ke liye sthagit kar di
 Sessions Judge UB Hejib said that he would decide on Salman's review petition on April 8 before hearing the hit and run case
 maamle main salmaan par aarope he ki unhone footpath par so rahe logon par car chadha di
 Legal sources said that after hearing the arguments, the court can also reject Salman's appeal and hear the case or send the case back to the magistrate and ask him to hear the case
 salmaan ke maamle kii ‘laaparvaahee se hui maut ’ (dhara 304 e) ke tahat kam aarope par pehle ek magistrate sunwaayee kar chuke he, jisamen do saal kaid kaa praavdhaan he
 a petition by the government and the Mumbai police, however, accused the magistrate of 'culpable homicide' (section 304 Part II), which the sessions court is hearing
 sutron ne bataaya ki magistrate ne maamle ko sunwaayee ke liye satr adaalat bhejte hue salmaan ko 11 march ko pesh hone kaa nirdesh diya tha, lekin vah hajir nahin hue kyonki us vakt yah faisla nahin hua tha ki maamle kii sunwaayee koun karegaa

 On September 28, 2002, a land cruiser climbed on the footboard outside a bakery in Bandra, which Salman was allegedly driving
 isse ek vyakti kii maut ho gai or chaar anya ghayal ho gaye the
 Sessions Court Judge UB Hezib said he would first hear the actor's appeal challenging the Bandra magistrate's order
 magistrate ne salmaan ke khilaaf gaiyr-iradatan hatya kaa aarope laga diya he, jo kahin adhik gambhir he or jisamen dosha siddh hone par das saal tak kii sajaa ho sakati he
 a lawyer appearing for Salman's senior counsel Ashok Mundargi appeared and sought some time to file select documents and the court adjourned the hearing for two weeks
 satr nyaayadhish you bi hezib ne kaha ki vah hit and ran maamle kii sunwaayee se pehle 8 april ko salmaan kii punariksha arji par faisla karenge
 Salman is accused in the case that he threw a car on the people sleeping on the pavement
 kanoonee sutron ne bataaya ki daleelein sunne ke baad adaalat salmaan kii apil thukraa bhi sakati he or maamle kii sunwaayee kar saktaa he athwa maamle ko waapas magistrate ke paas bhej saktaa he or unase maamle kii sunwaayee ke liye kah saktaa he
 a magistrate has earlier heard the lesser charge under Salman's case of 'death due to negligence' (section 304A), which provides for imprisonment for two years
 sarkaar or mumbai police kii ek yachika par haalanki magistrate ne ‘gaiyr iradatan hatya ’ (dhara 304 bhaag do) kaa aarope lagaaya, jis par satr adaalat sunwaayee karti he
 Sources said the magistrate had sent Salman to the sessions court for hearing the case and directed Salman to appear on March 11 but he did not appear as it was not decided at that time who would hear the case
 ab chunki ek nyaayadhish ko maamle kii sunwaayee kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya he vah sunwaayee kii taarikh mukarrar karenge or us din abhinayta ko pesh hona hoga
 After the testimony of 17 witnesses in the case, the magistrate came to the conclusion that a case of culpable homicide was made against the actor and with that he sent the case to the sessions court for re-hearing
 salmaan ke vakil ashok mundaargi ne 8 march ko satr adaalat main anurodh kiya tha ki abhinayta ke mukademe sunwaayee tathaa gaiyr iradatan hatya ke aarope vaale magistrate ke aadesh donon kii sunwaayee ek hi nyaayadhish kare
 The actor's appeal was approved by the court and the case was referred to Hezib
 abhinayta ne apni apil main daleel di he ki magistrate ne gaiyr-iradatan hatya kaa aarope lagaakar galati kii he
 The actor has termed the magistrate's proceedings as bad in the law
 tippaniyan Salman's lawyer argued that the magistrate had failed to notice that he did not intend (salman's intention) to kill people nor did he know that a person would be killed by his speed and carelessness or other Will get injured

 pradhanmantri modi na to bhartiya logon kii chaturaai kii thaah le paae or na hi yah andaja laga paae ki desh kaa banking system kis had tak bika hua he
 It is time to evaluate whether his courage, which some people also call insidious, has done something good for the country or not? The Reserve Bank of India report has again defeated the old wounds
 8 november 2016 ko bhartiya arthvyavastha par hue aghat ke baad logon ko nijee taur par jo pareshaaniyaan jhelni padin, bainkon ke baahar antaheen lambii kataren, khatm hoti naukariyaan or bharat ke liye sabase zyada rojgaar kaa intjaam karne vaale anaupchaarik kshetra or krishi par padi maar, sabaki yaaden taaja ho gayi
 The government is fortunate that Indians, especially the disadvantaged, have a habit of quietly suffering great shock
 nakadi-prabhutv vaali kisi anya arthvyavastha main sarkaar ne is tarah ke kadam uthaae hote, to vahaan nishchit taur par dange ho jate
 At the time of the announcement of demonetisation, the government had stated its three objectives - the abolition of black money, the detection of fake currency and the prevention of funding of terrorism
 sarkaar ne ek tir se kai shikaar karne ke daawey kiye the
 Unfortunately, the government's arrow could not hunt any
 kaha ja rahaa he ki kaala dhan ab bainkon main pahunch gaya he lekin abhi tak uski pahchaan nahin hui he
 Since all the money was returned, the existence of fake currency in the economy is also a mystery
 aatankwaad main koi kami nahin ai or report bataati he ki pehle ke mukaable arthvyavastha main aaj zyada note cirkulation main hai
 That is, the big claims of digitization of the economy are also hollow
 pradhanmantri modi 2014 main, sushasan or bhrashtachar par prahaar ke vaade ke saath satta main aae the
 However, it is also true that he has made several efforts to get rid of the chronic disease of black money
 notebandi ko bina taiyaari ke hua ek sanakee prayaas bataakar khaarij kiya ja saktaa he lekin pradhanmantri ko kareeb se jaanane vaale log mujhe bataate hai ki vah jo kuch bhi karte hai, vah kabhi yun hi nahin hota
 At first glance, it may seem that they have made a sudden decision without thinking well, but later you understand that that decision was part of a bigger plan and the same was with demonetisation
 unhone ek vishesh jaanch dal gathit kiya, kaale dhan par ankush lagane ke liye benami lenden (nishedh) sanshodhan adhinium lekar aae, bharat se nikalakar kaala dhan videshon main na jamaa hone paae iske liye unhone cyprus, singapore or morishas jaise tex hewan samajhe jane vaale deshon ke saath kar sandhiyon or soochnaaon ko saajha karne se jude samjhauton kii sharton kii samiksha kii or kaale dhan ko waapas system main laane ke liye svaichhik aay ghoshnaa yojana lekar aae
 In the form of demonetisation, the monster of black money was attacked last
 saath hi, hamen yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki modi ek rajaneta hai
 Apart from the economic justification of all his works, there are political meanings and demonetisation was also a political decision
 unhone ek sanket diya ki ve beyimaani se maalamaal hue logon ko chhodane vaale nahin or unase paisa chhinakar garibon kii bhalaai main lagaayenge
 It also benefited
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaavon main bhaajapa ko mili baari jeet iskaa pramaan he
 Through several schemes launched by the government, black money worth Rs 44,000 crore was also returned and tax collection has also increased
 isaki saraahna honi chahie lekin notebandi ne jitna dard diya, kya uske anuroop laabh hua? is par bahes-mubahise kaa daur jari he
 Deputy Editor M
 ji
 Our cover story, prepared by Arun and Senior Editor Shweta Punj, outlines the consequences of demonetisation and the war against black money
 hamaare paas paanch arthshaastra visheshgyon kaa ek panel bhi he jinhone is vishay kii sookshm vivechna kii he
 It should be understood that the war against illegal money is a long term process
 ise raturaat nahin hasil kiya ja saktaa
 Now that we have overcome demonetisation, only a small but good result is visible
 pratyaksh karadaataaon kii sankhya, chaar karod se badhkar kareeb paune saat karod ho gai he
 The people of India are notorious for cutting back from paying taxes
 kya aap kalpana kar sakate hai, hamaare desh main keval 60,000 vyakti hi aise hai jinaki kul salanaa aay 1 karod rupye he? hamen apane chaaron ore jitani dikhaawati phijulkharchi najar aa jaati he use dekhte hue yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki hamen ek eemaandaar raashtra banane ke liye sarkaar ko abhi bahut kuch karne kii jarurat he
 In the past, no other government has shown such a resolve to attack black money
 sarkaar ke drushtikon main mul dosha yah he ki iske sabhi prayaas kaale dhan kii aapurti ko kam karne kii disha main hai; bhrasht logon dwaara kaale dhan kii maang ko kam karne kii disha main usne bahut kam prayaas kiye hai
 This can only be done by fulfilling the promise of minimum government or minimum government, the NDA government could not fulfill its promise
 isliye is par koi hairaani nahin honi chahie ki sara kaala dhan waapas system main aa gaya he
 The government is also scrutinizing the 18 lakh bank accounts in which huge deposits were made immediately after November 2016
 aise 3,00,000 se adhik logon ko iskar notice bheje gaye hai jinhone apane bank khaaton main 10 lakh rupye tak jamaa kiye the lekin unhone iskar ritern nahin daakhil nahin kiya tha
 The government needs the help of artificial intelligence-based tools to monitor these high-value deposits and identify black money
 or yah sab, logon ko aatankit kiye bina yaa phir arthvyavastha kii gati par brake lagaae bina kiya janaa chahie
 The snake will also die and the sticks will not break, that is, it will be beneficial, people will not have to face any problem

 While Gadkari expressed confidence of continuing the alliance with Shiv Sena, he also said that the BJP government will never change the Constitution of Babasaheb Ambedkar
 badbhole bayanon ko lekar gadakari ne mana ki hamaare bich se bhi koi ulta-sidhaa bol detaa he or media use uthaa letaa he
 In 'sidhi Baat', Gadkari answered the questions posed by anchor Shweta Singh in his own special way
 gadakari ke paas jahajrani, jal sansaadhan, nadi vikaas or ganga sangrakshan vibhaagon kii bhi jimmedaari he
 When Gadkari was asked that his roads are fast, but why the speed of the government car is low, he said, "what happened during the tenure of Congress in the 10 years before 2014 and what happened in the Modi government? We will assume that the government car is running at a high speed

 ’kya bijepi vikaas ke mudde par hi 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav ladegi? is sawaal ke jawaab main gadakari ne kaha ki 100 fisadi aisa hi hoga
 He said, 'modi has talked about' Politics for Progress and Development 'all the time, rising above caste, religion, creed, language
 ham hindustan ko sukhi, samrudh, sampann or shaktishaalee bananaa chaahate hai
 Fear wants to be free from terror and corruption
 ’badbhole bayanon par kya bolegdakari se jab ye poocha ki jab bhi chunaav paas aate hai to vikaas ruk jaataa he or ‘shmashaan kabristaan’ jaise bayaan aane lagate hai to unhone kaha, ‘media aise vishay uthaata he ki vivaad khadaa ho jaataa he, usee pe charchaa shuru ho jaati he

 On the question of inflation, Gadkari said, 'manmohan government had 18% inflation, 4% in our government
 petroleum ke price kam the, aaj bade hai
 Today, inflation has increased due to petroleum, but we are not responsible for it
 bhav kam hue the, tab international market main kachche tel kii keemat kam hui thi
 Today it is more

 'the question related to the resentment of the farmers, Paragdkari said that solving the problems of the farmers is our priority
 saath hi ham prayaas kar rahe hai ki kisaanon ko nunatam samarthan mulya (MSP) se bhi zyada kaise den
 Won't change Ambedkar's constitution, why are Dalits torn apart? On this question, Gadkari said, 'the incidents that happened in Maharashtra proved to be false
 bhima koregaanv main maovadiyon ne daliton ko bhadakaane kii koshish kii
 Now action is being taken on them

 Congress's policy is to instill fear in the hearts of the minority, in the hearts of the Dalits
 baba sahib kaa samvidhan badalane kii baat karte hai, ham kabhi nahin badalane vaale
 'shiv Sena will be frozen, Shivsena is with BJP only for the name, on this question, Gadkari said,' There is a saying, 'tera mera zamata nahin, tera mein kar karamata nahin hai, We will freeze with Shiv Sena'
 gadakari ne kaha, ‘shivasena or hamane vichaaron ke aadhaar par kaam kiya he
 If the relationship is needed, i will also talk if it does not break
 ’aapke rishte sabake saath achche hai, kya koi nayaa rishta bhi ban saktaa he sharad pavaar kii party NCP ke saath? is sawaal ke jawaab main gadakari ne kaha, ‘abhi aisi koi sambhaavna nahin he

 Prime Minister Modi linked his political opponents to the scam in his own style
 phir mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne unako unheen kii bhashaa main karaara jawaab diya
 At the rally in Meerut, Modi advised Uttar Pradesh to avoid scams, saying that the scam of s means Samajwadi Party, c means Congress, a means Akhilesh and m means Mayawati
 akhilesh ne turant palatwaar karte hue scam par tanj kas diya
 s to Save, c to Country, a to Amit Shah and m to Modi
 yani seve country from amit shah and modi
 After this verbal war between Modi and Akhilesh, there was a huge discussion on social media about the word scam

 In response, Sussex team was reduced to 191 runs despite Ranjit Singhji's century (100 runs) on the third day and could not save the follow-on
 iske baad foloon pari main ek baar phir ranjit singhji ne naabad 125 ran bana daale or ek hi din main do shatak lagane kaa karishma kar dikhaaya
 Sussex scored 260 / 2 to save the match thanks to Ranjit Singhji's century
 FACTS --iske saath hi ek hi match main do shatak lagane vaale sasex ke tisare ballebaaj bane
 But more than this, in First Class cricket, he became the only cricketer to score two centuries on the same day
 -ranjit singhji ke baad se kisi bhi ballebaaj ne pratham shrenee cricket main aisa karnama nahin kiya he
 However, playing for Western Australia, Matthew Eliot scored 104 runs on 31 December 1995 and then 135 runs in the follow-on innings
 tab aliot pehali pari main ek din pehle 98 ran banaakar naabad rahe the
 For this reason, Elliott's centuries cannot be compared to Ranjit Singhji
 - haa, spain ke ballebaaj tarik ali awan ne 4 sitambar 2012 ko european championships divijan-2 tii-20 main ek hi din naabad 150 or 148 ranon kii pari kheli thi
 Tariq then scored 150 not out from 66 balls against Estonia and 148 in the semi-final against Portugal in the next match on the same day
 haalanki unki team final main sthaan banane se chook gai
 Ranjit Singhji's career 1

 In 1915, Ranji was injured during hunting and lost the right eye light 5
 desh kaa pratishthit first class cricket toornament- ranjai trophy inhen ke naam par he After the military coup in the South Asian country Thailand, the US has canceled the ongoing military exercise with Thailand, seeking the re-establishment of democratic rule there
 iske saath hi america ne kai dwipaksheeya qaraar bhi radd kar die hai
 After running anti-government protests for several months, Thailand's army captured power through a coup on Thursday
 sena junta ne kal desh kii seenet ko bhang kar diya
 Acting swiftly after the coup, it arrested Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and other top leaders of the ousted government
 pentagon ke press sachiv rier admiral jon kirbi ne kal ek bayaan main kaha, 'haalanki thailand ke saath hamaare dirghakaalik or sakaaratmak sainya sambandh rahe hai
 We need to rethink US military cooperation and agreements according to our own democratic principles and American law
 ' Kirby said the Pentagon is canceling the ongoing practice CARAT 2014
 700 america sainikon kii bhagidaari vaale in vashirk nausainya abhyaason main nausainik, navik, jahaaj or vimaan shaamil hai
 Kirby said, 'as we have made clear that the Royal Thai Amard Forces (thailand's military force) should end this military coup and restore the principles and processes of democratic governance to the people of Thailand
 iske saath hi chunaavon ke liye bhi rasta saaf karnaa chahie
 ' pentagon ne june main america prashanth bede ke commander admiral eri haris kii prastaavit thailand yatra bhi radd kar di
 Along with this, he also canceled the invitation to the Royal Thai Armed Forces Commander General Tanasak to come to the US Pacific Command in June
 videsh mantralay kii uppravaktaa mairi harf ne ek alag bayaan main kaha, 'ham tatkaal naagarik shashan kii bahaali, bandi banaae gaye netaaon kii rihaai, jaldi chunaavon ke jariye loktantr kii bahaali or maanavadhikaron evam moolbhoot swatantraaa ke sammaan kii maang karte hai
 ' anshan main vighn daalane se kshubdh baba ramdev ne sarkaar kii jamkar khinchaai kii or apane samarthakon par pulisia barbarta ko lekar sonia gandhi ko nishaanaa banaaya
 Ramdev has warned of a nationwide movement
 ramlila maidan main mahilaon or bacchon par police karrwai ko loktantr par kalank bataate hue unhone daawa kiya ki centre sarkaar ne unhen jaan se maarane kaa shadyantr rachaa or varisht mantriyon ke saath baithak ke dauraan hi unhen dhamkee di gai thi
 Ramdev, who was detained in a dramatic incident at the rally before being sent here from Delhi, looked quite distracted
 apane samarthakon par aadhi raat ko hui karrwai ko lekar aisa lag rahaa tha ki vah ro padenge
 Referring to the Thyenaman Chowk massacre, he said, vandalism and atrocities on one lakh people crossed all limits
 is tarah kaa atyaachaar china ke alaava kahin or nahin dekha gaya jahaan hajaaron log maare gaye the
 Ramdev said, Satyagraha is not over
 sarkaar ko avashya jawaab dena chahie
 We will go to every door in villages across the country and tell people about the brutality of this government
 ham phir dilli jaaenge yaa agar mujhe dabaane kaa shadyantr kiya jaataa he to ham dilli ke najadik kisi jagah par satyagrah par baithenge
 Book: True Lieutenant: Vinod Bhardwaj Prakashkar: Vani Prakashankar: Paperback Price: Rs
 250: 110 Nothing is completely white or white
 in donon ke bich rangon kii kai paraten hoti hai or un paraton ke bich sach or jhooth ke kai aayam hote hai
 Vinod Bhardwaj's book 'saccha Jhoot' also seems to be a story based on this pattern
 kitaab ke kirdaar aam aadmi kii jindagi se uthaae hue mahasoos hote hai
 Reading the story, it seems that these characters are roaming around us
 yun to kahani chaar dashak pehle shuru hoti he, lekin isamen uthaae mudde aaj ke daur main bhi sahi lagate hai
 The fear of Babadin is not the name of a person
 yah naam ek khauf kaa he, jo lekhak se hi judaa hua he
 Babadin has become a part of the writer's life
 umr ke har padaav par baabadin kii yaad uske saath rahati he
 The writer has a full cocktail of feelings towards Babadin
 kuntha, krodh or bhay ke bich chaah bhi he
 To meet Babadin once
 kathin se kathin halaat main vinod baabadin ko yaad jarur karte hai
 Babadin was indeed a disgusting person
 vah chote ladakon kaa yon shoshan kiya karata tha
 The writer herself has been a victim of this abomination during her school days, and that dreadful memory never leaves her
 us haadase ne use kuntha or apmaan ke jis daldal main daal diya tha vah usase nikal hi nahin paata
 He feels as if that moment has stuck somewhere in his body
 yaa kahen ki uske vajood kaa ek hissaa sa ban gaya he
 The story makes one think that sexual abuse cases of children are not new
 balki ham aaj kii tarah pehle ke jamaane main in muddon par itane mukhar nahin the
 Child sexual abuse cases are still seen today
 khaastaur par ladakon ke saath ho rahe yon aparaadhon ko peedit kaa parivaar samaaj ke dar se uthaate bhi nahin hai
 Even the main character of the story could not mention this incident to anyone
 kahani kaa ek doosraa pahalu patrakaritakahani main patrakarita kshetra se jude kai romaanchak kisse hai
 The book highlights the irregularities associated with journalism
 ek patrkaar kii maansik sthiti or banjaarepan ko bataati he ye kahani
 The 'true lie' reflects the battles between the world of books and personal life
 mahilaon kaa bakhubi charitra chithran'sachcha jhooth' har tarah kii mahilaon ke kirdaar ko jeeta he
 The female characters of the story are not Dabi Kuchali
 ve shashakt hai
 Be it Sonakshi, a high-profile woman, or Baiji, a prostitute in the dark streets of Calcutta, or Emergency Wife Sudha
 is kahani kaa mukhya paatr sudhir in mahilaon ke sampark main aata he or ye sabhi kirdaar uske jivan main apana ek rang chhod jate hai
 This story weaves a strange sense of relationship
 taazgi bharaa lekhankahani main nadiyon si ravaanagi he
 And there are many adventures in its journey like a river
 kahani ant tak apni raftaar kaayam rakhti he
 Vinod Bhardwaj is thrilled with his writing
 sachcha jhooth mjedaar kahaniyon kaa pulinda he
 Colloquial language is used in the story
 isliye isaki bhashaa bojhil nahin lagati he
 True lies lie in the fear of Babadin as well as the vagaries of journalism and the lifeless situations associated with life
 Reading this book will help in understanding life better
 kitaab kii kahani ko is tarah se pesh kiya gaya he ki yah aapako aakhir tak baandhe rakhegi

 com / dnwemn8ni7a post shared by Entertainment Tube -ET! (@entertainmenttube) on Jul 5, 2018 at 7:27 am PDT desh kii rajdhani dilli main pradooshan kaa str is kadar bad gaya he ki ab yah rahane laayak bhi nahin bachi he
 In fact, Supreme Court Justice Arun Mishra made a special comment on Friday about the rising level of pollution in Delhi
 unhone kaha ki dilli main jis tarah ke halaat ho gaye usase yah to saaf he ki yah shahar ab rahane or kaam karne laayak nahin bachaa he
 Justice Mishra said that i was initially attracted to Delhi but now it is not so
 main ritair hone ke baad dilli main nahin rahoonga
 On the matter of pollution in Delhi, Justice Mishra further said that jams and pollution are very high in Delhi
 jam kii vajah se aaj subah mujhe nae jajon ke shapathgrahan samaaroh main pahunchane main deree hone vaali thi
 The court asked the Delhi government to consider the Rapid Rail between Delhi and Meerut within the next ten days
 or isaki jaankaree court ko den
 The Delhi government said that they do not have money for this
 dilli sarkaar kii is daleel par court ne kaha ki aap aisa kahkar apni jimmedaariyon se nahin batch sakate hai
 All this is being done only for the common people
 court ne sunwaayee ke dauraan dilli sarkaar ko ek farvari tak rajdhani main parking policy ko antim rup dene ko bhi kaha he
 Let me tell you that even before seeing the level of pollution in Delhi, the Delhi High Court has commented
 saal 2015 main bhi dilli ucch nyaayalay ne tippanee kii thi ki rashtriya rajdhani main vaayu pradooshan kaa vartmaan str 'chintajanak' sthiti tak pahunch gaya he or yah 'gas chembar main rahane' jaisaa he
 The court also directed the Center and the Delhi government to submit detailed action plans to deal with it
 pichley saal ke bajet ke dauraan dilli ke upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne bacchon ke mid de mile kii paushtikta badhaane ke liye regular khaane ke saath rojaanaa fal or andey dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 The government had also allocated a budget of Rs 55 crore for this
 lekin ek saal baad bhi dilli ke kisi bhi sarkari skool main fal or andey bantna shuru nahin hua
 The school children of Delhi are waiting for the promise made by the government
 bacchon kaa kahana he ki unhen fal or andey khaane ke liye chahie
 At the same time, the Government School Teacher's Association, the largest institution of teachers teaching in Delhi government schools, says that the government had made a very good promise, but it has not been fulfilled yet
 sarkaar jald se jald yah vaada puraa kare, kyonki bacchon ke swasthya main abhi or sudhaar kii jarurat he
 Ajay Vijay Veer Yadav, President of the Government School Teacher's Association, says that we request the government to fulfill this promise as soon as possible, as the whole nation sees Delhi
 bijepi ne saadhaa nishanabijepi ne bhi is mudde ko sarkaar kii vaada khilaaphi se jod diya he
 Delhi BJP has said that the government should not at least lie to children
 dilli bijepi ke pravaktaa praveen shankar kapur kehete hai ki sarkaar ab bacchon ko bhi gumraah karne main utar ai he or bacchon ke khaane ke saath majaak kar rahi he
 How much more government will go down than this
 desh kii rajdhani sthit neshnal media centre (enemasi) raajnneeti kaa akhaada banataa dikh rahaa he
 Last year, the center was inaugurated by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 lekin sarkaar badali to media centre kii tasviir bhi badal gai
 In a hurry, stones were placed on the walls of the media center, on which it is written that the foundation of this center was laid by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 enemasi kii aadharshila purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi dwaara rakhe jane kaa zikr karne vaali ek pattica aaj phir se is imaarat ke baahar laga di gai
 Ministry officials said Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar visited NMC today after which the plaque was placed
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki imaarat ke baahar pehle hi yah pattica lagaai gai thi lekin imaarat ke nirmaanadhin rahane ke dauraan ise kshatigrast hone se bachaane ke liye hataa diya gaya tha
 Javadekar instructed the officers to install the plaque
 unke nirdeshon kaa fouran paalan kiya gaya or shaam tak pattica enemasi pravesh par laga di gai
 It is worth mentioning that in this plaque it is written that on 5 December 2001, Vajpayee laid the foundation stone and the then Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani presided over the function
 gulmarg ke paas barf main dab kar fouj ko solah javaanon kii maut ho gai he
 Four soldiers are still missing
 ye jawan srinagar se pachaas kilometre dur khilanmarg ke paas avalanch main funs gaye the
 The jawans had gone there to take battle training on the High Altitude
 somvaar kii subah kareeb gyaarah baje achaanak avalanch aa gaya
 Ice rocks began to fall at the military's temporary training camp
 haalanki, aasapaas hi kai or camp lage the, jisaki vajah se fouran javaanon ne bachaav kaam shuru kar diya
 Forty soldiers have been safely evacuated
 chaar abhi bhi laapata hai jabaki solah javaanon ko bachaaya nahin ja sakaa
 This snowfall is not new for army soldiers
 barfile chattaanon kaa khisakna bhi in phogiyon ke liye nayaa nahin
 This place of Khilanmarg is also not new to him
 lekin, barf kaa safed kahar is tarah un par tuutegaa, ye unhone kabhi sochaa nahin tha kyonki khilanmarg kaa ye ilaaka avalanch se surakshit mana jaataa he yahi vajah he fouj ne hai altichute warfare training ke liye is jagah kaa chunaav kiya tha
 However, at around eleven o'clock in the morning, such a snow storm arose that a team of about 60 soldiers came under the snow
 fouj ke jawan apane saathiyon ko barf ke malbe se nikaalane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The weather is still bad and rescue work will not be done easily
 darasal, fouj har saal is mausam yahaan hai altichhut warfare skool lagaati he
 In the school, the army is given training in mountain climbing, snow skiing and other things especially in high altitude areas
 is baar is training main fouj ke kareeb saadhe teen sau prashikshu javaanon samet paanch log shariq hue the
 These people were divided into groups of 60–70
 yahi vajah he ki barf kii chattaane jab khiskin to iskaa shikaar sirf ek dal hua
 If all the soldiers were in one place, the loss would have been much greater
 yahi nahin thodi dur par hi baaki phogiyon kii maujuudagi kii vajah se bachaav kaam fouran shuru ho gaya kyonki ghatnasthal se 25 kimi dur tak barf ke chalate sadak jam he
 In such a situation, the rescue team was difficult to reach
 barf khisakane kaa adhyayan karne vaale snow avalanch study stablisment (eseesi) ne ravivaar shaam ko hi yah chetavanee jari kar di thi ki oonchai par chattan khisakane kii ghatana ho sakati he aise main oonchai par rahane vaale log un ilaakon se hat jaaen jahaan pichley teen dinon se baari barfbaari ho rahi thi
 What happens is that when a large amount of ice rocks starts falling from the high hills, it is called Avalanch
 avalanch barfile tufaan kii tarah najar aata he
 When Avalanch comes, it seems as if a mountain of snow is falling from the sky
 yah itnaa khatarnaak hota he ki majboot se majboot ped, chattaane, jo bhi isaki chapet main aata he, uskaa bachanaa mushkil he
 If avalanches are dangerous, then there is a huge catastrophe in a short time
 jin pahari ilaakon main baari barfbaari hoti he vahaan iskaa khatra bahut zyada rahata he
 Most avalanches come due to the weather
 jab sard hawaaen chalati hai or barfili chattaane pahaad kii dhalaanon par tik nahin pate to wo neeche kii ore girane lagate hai
 Sometimes during the trekking on the hill such accidents also happen
 nukili chizon se rassi ko latakaane kii koshish main barf kaa ek hissaa darakta he or phir barfili chattaanon kii barish shuru ho jaati he

 This memo has been sent on 25 March 2011
 is memo main 2ji spectrum ghotaale ko lekar ahm jaankaree di gai he

 ye chitthee 9 janvari 2008 ko tatkaaleen vittamantri pi chidambaram ke paas bhi pahunchi
 The letter was given by Finance Ministry officials with the suggestion that the entry fee in 2G allocation and the auction process should be made a licensing measure

 yani saaf he ki agar chidambaram chaahate to ghotaale ko roak sakate the
 The same has been said in the report submitted by the Finance Ministry to the court today

 The controversy in the Grand Alliance over supporting nda-backed candidate Ramnath Kovind in the presidential election had not yet fully calmed down that Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav are not there on another important issue
 yah ahm masalaa he jiesti launch samaaroh kaa
 Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal will not participate in the GST function at midnight on Friday, but Nitish's party will be a part of the event
 aise main donon partiyon ke bich ek baar phir se jubaani jang dekhne ko mil sakati he
 The comments nitish kumaar ke karyaalay kii ore se kaha gaya he ki vah jiesti kaa samarthan karenge
 Not only this, JDU was also in favor of GST during UPA regime
 gauratlab he ki kai vipakshi partiyon ne shuukravaar raat sansad main yojit hone vaale jiesti samaaroh kaa bahishkaar kar diya he
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was invited to the ceremony, but he would also not participate in the Congress's absence
 congress kaa kahana he ki vyapaaree abhi is bade kar sudhaar ke liye puri tarah se taiyaar nahin he or isliye sarkaar ko iskaa kriyanvayan philhal taal dena chahie
 The Congress also says that the GST function is against the dignity of Parliament
 vipakshi partiyon se ulat saraakaar ke kadam kaa samarthan karke nitish kumaar ne ek baar phir apni gathbandhan partiyon se hatakar nirnay liya he
 Earlier, he had made the RJD and Congress uncomfortable by supporting bjp-backed candidate Ramnath Kovind for the presidential election
 is maamle kaa sabase rochak pahalu yah tha ki nitish kumaar ne hi raashtrapati chunaav ke liye vipaksh kaa ummidavaar khadaa karne kii vakaalat kii thi
 In this connection, he also met Congress President Smt
 Sonia Gandhi
 17 vipakshi partiyaan ekajute ho gai thim lekin isse pehle ve apane sanyukt ummidavaar kii ghoshnaa karte, nitish ne paala badalakar sabko hairaan kar diya
 After Nitish Kumar announced his support for Ramnath Kovind, the RJD and Congress, who were part of the Bihar Grand Alliance, termed his move a historic mistake
 iske jawaab main nitish kumaar ne kaha tha ki bijepi ne paryaapt samarthan juta liya he
 Significantly, in 2013, JDU supremo Nitish Kumar broke his 13-year-old alliance with the BJP and joined Lalu
 jediu ne piem modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaae jane kii mukhaalafat karte hue gathbandhan todaa tha
 However, during the last six months, he has praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decisions on several occasions
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki nitish 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ko dhyaan main rakhte hue bijepi se nazdikiyaan badha rahe hai kyonki ve jaanate hai ki pradhanmantri modi ko haraana bahut hi mushkil hoga
 Nitish Kumar's office has said that he will support GST
 itani hi nahin, upie shasankaal main bhi jediu jiesti ke paksh main thi
 Significantly, many opposition parties have boycotted the GST function to be held in Parliament on Friday night
 is samaaroh main purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha lekin congress ke samaaroh main shaamil na hone se ve bhi isamen hissaa nahin lenge
 Congress says that the businessman is not fully ready for this big tax reform right now and hence the government should postpone its implementation right now
 congress kaa yah bhi kahana he ki jiesti samaaroh sansad kii garima ke khilaaf he
 Nitish Kumar has once again decided to move away from his coalition parties by backing the government's move unlike the opposition parties
 isse pehle unhone raashtrapati chunaav ke liye bijepi samarthit ummidavaar ramnath kovind kaa samarthan karke argedy or congress ko asahaj kar diya tha
 The most interesting aspect of this case was that Nitish Kumar had advocated for the candidature of the opposition for the presidential election
 is silsile main unhone congress adhyaksh shrimati sonia gandhi se mulaakaat bhi kii thi
 The 17 opposition parties were united but before they announced their joint candidate, Nitish surprised everyone by turning his back
 nitish kumaar dwaara ramnath kovind kaa samarthan karne kii ghoshnaa karne ke baad bihar mahagathbandhan main shaamil argedy or congress ne unke is kadam ko aitihaasik bhul qaraar diya tha
 In response to this, Nitish Kumar had said that BJP has gathered enough support
 gauratlab yah bhi 2013 main jediu supremeo nitish kumaar ne bijepi se apane 13 saal puraane gathbandhan ko todakar lalu se naata jod liya tha
 The JDU broke the coalition, opposing the appointment of PM Modi as the prime ministerial candidate
 haalanki, pichley chah maah ke dauraan unhone kai maukon par pradhanmantri narendra modi ke faislon kii tarif kii he
 Experts say that keeping in mind the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Nitish is increasing his closeness with the BJP because he knows that it will be very difficult to defeat Prime Minister Modi

 Piplani had reached the program of young CM Yogi Adityanath at the Saroja Palace in Katra
 nateeja ye hua ki jaise-taise sabhaagaar aadha bhar paaya
 While the youth were missing from half the chairs
 ye dekh kaarykram ke sanyojakon ke paseene chhootane lage
 Seeing disrespect in front of the CM, in a hurry, the convenors started calling BJP workers
 iske baad yuvaaon kii jagah bijepi ke bujurg kaaryakartaaon ne lee
 However, CM was also unhappy seeing the photos of the auditorium
 ise lekar sabhaagaar main tarah-tarah kii charchaa chalati rahi
 Varanasi is considered to be the strongest stronghold of the BJP
 piem narendra modi khud yahaan se saansad hai
 Despite this, political experts are also surprised to see the condition of the BJP inside the city
 iske pehle yogi mathura main saansad hema malini ke namakan main gayi the vahaan hui jansabha main bhi kursiyaan khaali thim
 Whose news had also made headlines, the same was the case in Ghaziabad, after Ghaziabad, there was a Vijay Sankalp Sabha in Varanasi on March 26, in which more than half of the chairs were left empty
 is sabha main to bijepi ke kaaryakarta kursi hataate or rakhte nazar aaye the
 After all, why are the chairs of the Yogi vacant in the House of Yogis, politics experts are looking at it from a different point of view
 It is coming out that Yogi Aditya Nath was the fire brand leader of the Hindu Yuva Vahini, who was his straight, strong language He used to attack the opposition, which was loved by his fans, but now he is the CM of Uttar Pradesh, so he is speaking in his dignity, so that crowd f is not coming
 ye baat isse bhi pukhta hoti nazar aati he ki jab yahi yogi kisi duusare soobe main apni hindutv vaadi tikhe bhaashanon ko dete hai to vahaan unki janata jutati he
 The second view is that this time the Modi wave is not visible compared to 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 alam ye he ki bijepi ke bade netaaon ko bhi sunne ke liye log nahin pahunch rahe hai
 It tells that the public is silent in this election, only the workers of all parties are visible and the workers will know how many seats will be filled
 abhi chote-chote haul or choti jan sabhaaon main kursiyaan khaali rah ja raheen hai to aane vaale dinon main bade maidan kaise bharenge ye netaaon ke liye ek badi chunauti nazar aa rahi hai
 Government of India has been continuously campaigning to bring cleanliness throughout the country
 khud pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi aksar apane bhaashanon main desh ke logon se swatchta abhiyaan kaa hissaa banane ke liye prerit karte rahete hai

 Also, topped his sister's wedding card pin to his page
 taaki jo koi bhi piem modi ke twitor pej par jaae use sabase pehle akaash jain ke is pahal se prerana mil sake

 And when you are the people who have given the right to the people of the country, then after the results of the elections that have been given to the people today, after the results, the country will also know what voice is coming out of Ahmedabad
 main jab se saarvajanik jivan main aayaa, visheshkar raajnneetik jivan main shaayad mere chunavi jivan main aisa pehla chunaav he, jab ahmedabad main main ek baar bhi nahin aayaa

 hindustan ke har kone se bhartiya janata party ko vot mili

 aazaadee ke baad pehla dal bina congress ke gotra vaala aayaa he
 For the first time in the country, the people of the country have ordered a Bharatiya Janata Party to form a government
 purna bahumat ke saath diya he
 Ever since independence, the Janata Party government was formed, it was the platform of many parties
 atal ji ke netritv main sarkaar bani to or jab spasht janadesh miltaa he, jimmevary bhi badhati he
 The orders which the people of the country have given to the Bharatiya Janata Party, which have been defeated, have not been given to degrade them
 loktantr main jinka ek bhi candidet nahin aayaa hoga aise bhi kai dal hai jinka ek bhi saansad sansad main nahin aayaa hoga
 i want to tell them that you are equally important to us
 kyonki ham jaanate hai ki aap saarvajanik jivan main desh kii bhalaai karne kii ichha rakhte hai
 We also want to add your goodies
 todane kii raajnneeti kaa yug samaapt ho chukaa he
 The politics of linking has started from today

 The social fabric will create a fearless tricolor
 apatkaal ke baad ek chunaav aayaa tha jisamen uttari bharat main saamaajik parivesh se upar uth kar bhartiya loktantr ke liye vot kiya gaya tha
 After the Emergency, i am witnessing the first election in which people have voted above casteism
 jatvaad kii tivrata, jativaadee maansikta ko chhodkar hindustan main ek nayaa aayam khadaa hua he jo aane vaale dinon main bharat ke liye ek shubh sanket he
 In our country it was believed that to win elections one has to do politics of vote bank
 jinaki wo aadat thi wo un sadhano ko lekar khelte rahe
 We had decided that we will carry on with good governance
 hindustan kaa ek bahut bada tabaka khadaa hua he jo jaanata he ki hamaare aage badhane kaa sabase bada kaaran vikaas hi hoga
 i say those who criticized Modi also had helplessness? Modi who speaks of the Gujarat model is a balloon
 unako pasand aae yaa naa aae lekin majabuuran bolnaa padataa tha
 Those who criticized me did not know that Modi is such a magician

 Development works won
 unako bhi jane anjaane main gujarat kii negative baaten bataani thi lekin jane anjaane unhone bhi vikaas kii hi baaten kii
 After forming the government in Gujarat four times, i believe that all sorrows are the same medicine

 Without development, my country will not survive
 1857 se ham dekhen to desh kaa ek konaa bhi nahin hoga jahaan aazaadee ke liye log shahid na hue honge

 The feeling that Mahatma Gandhi aroused among the people that i am doing for freedom
 gandhi ji kaa sabase bada yogadan tha ki unhone aazaadee ko janandolan kaa swaroop diya
 In the same way, we have to give development the form of mass movement
 aapako kabhi feel hua ki desh main sarkaar he? aapako feel hota he na ki gujarat main sarkaar he?ek vaataavaran hota he anti stablisment kaa doosraa hota he ko-stablisment kaa lekin yahaan to vaikum tha
 Now is the time to think in a new way
 political pandit is par charchaa karenge
 This is the specialty of India's democracy or else a person like me who belongs to a normal family has been taken over by the people of the country
 hamaari loktantr kii jaden or majboot honi chahie
 This election will strengthen India's democracy
 gujarat hi he jisane mujhe bada banaaya, ungali pakadakar chalanaa sikhaaya
 Wherever you sent me, the fame of whatever will be good goes to you
 or agar kami rah gai to meri jimmevary hogi
 i am going with this belief
 main kahin par hum
 Why should i not live in any form
 karodon gujaratiyon kaa mujhapar usee tarah haq banataa he
 i will come to know your suffering just like my family is ill, there is a disaster in my house
 or isliye main gujarat main kabhi koi kami mahasoos nahin hone duungaa kyonki aapane mujhe banaaya he
 The parents raise their son and send them to the army, but they understand that the son will worry about them as long as he is alive
 usee tarah aap hi mere maa-baap hai
 Now give strength to serve 6 crores to 125 crores
 aap hi meri seva hai, takat hai or purusharth hai
 You welcomed me, honored and thank you very much
 bharat mata kii jai
