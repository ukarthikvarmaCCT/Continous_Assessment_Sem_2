 Was the timing of Bhagwat ji's statement not correct? Do not look at it from this perspective, rather say that we have given the answer in time
 '' 21 sitambar kii der shaam jab aresas or bijepi kii ore se aarakshan kii samiksha vaale sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ke intervyuu par spashtikaran jari ho gaya, tab bihar vidhansabha chunaav se jude kuch netaa isi tarah samvaad kar rahe the
 In an interview to the RSS mouthpiece Panchajanya and the Organizer, Bhagwat did not comment directly on the current reservation system, but he called for a review by forming a committee in view of the voices raising the demand for reservation in the backward classes
 isse siyaasi tufaan khadaa ho gaya or bihar vidhansabha chunaav main saamaajik sameekaran kaa khaakaa bun rahi bijepi kii peshaani par bal pad gaye
 The nitish-lalu camp immediately made it an election issue and the BJP was forced to part with Bhagwat's statement
 lekin sangh ke sanghathan vishwa hindu parishad ne bhagwat ke sur main sur milaate hue maang kar di ki ek nyaayik ayog banaakar isaki samiksha honi chahie
 But BJP national president Amit Shah, who was embroiled in a battle of prestige in Bihar, felt that this could lead to electoral losses, so he appealed to the Sangh court for immediate relief
 damege control par manthandarasal, yah bayaan us sanghathan ke mukhiya kii ore se aayaa tha, jise bijepi apana preranarot or maardarshak maanati he
 Therefore, it was not easy for any BJP leader to dismiss this comment
 maamle kii gambhirtha kaa andaja isse lagaaya ja saktaa he ki party ke kisi bhi netaa ne bhagwat or sarkarywah bhaiyaji joshi se sidhe baat nahin kii
 On September 21, when political attacks on Bhagwat's statement started, according to sources, Amit Shah first talked to Sangh's co-sarkarivah Krishna Gopal, who was responsible for coordinating with the BJP, and predicted the possibility of loss in Bihar elections
 uske baad shah ne rashtriya sanghathan mahasachiv raamalaal, bihar kii sanghathantmak jimmedaari sambhaal rahe sah-sanghathan mantri saudaan singh, prabharee mahasachiv bhupendra yadav ke saath manthan kiya
 But the difficulty was that if the BJP shied away from Bhagwat's stand, then a new war would have arisen
 isliye tay kiya gaya ki pehle sangh kaa spashtikaran jari ho or baad main party bayaan de
 According to the sources, the BJP president requested the Sangh to provide some clarification that would also uphold the Sarsanghchalak's dignity and not harm the BJP either
 lihaaja, unhone bijepi mahasachiv ram madhav ko sangh se sampark kii jimmedaari di
 According to the sources, Madhav and Ramlal discussed the issue of clarification with Krishna Gopal to be issued by the Sangh and the BJP
 lekin shah chaahate the ki yah masalaa 21 sitambar kii der shaam tak nibat jaae
 It has been emphasized by the BJP that the first line of clarification should be such that it gives the message that no comment has been made on the present reservation system
 sutron ke mutabik, antim majamoon par bhagwat kii sahmati hasil kii gai, lekin bayaan par dastakhat lene main bhi aadhe ghante kii deree hui, kyonki akhil bhartiya prachaar pramukh manmohan vaidya duusare kaarykram main vyast the
 So the BJP also had to delay the press conference
 der shaam pehle sangh kii ore se or phir bijepi ne bayaan jari kiya
 According to the strategy, the Sangh statement said, "in this interview, Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat Ji of the Sangh has not made any comment regarding the reservation currently being provided to the various weaker sections of the society, but in the minds of the constitution makers According to the sentiment, the benefit of reservation must reach all the weaker sections of the society, it should be considered jointly by all the people
 '' sangh ne aakhri line main is saakshaatkaar ko ekatm maanav darshan ke sandarbh main dekhne kii baat kahi
 In its statement, the BJP bluntly said, "BJP has been in favor of reservation of Dalits, tribals, backward and extremely backward since its inception and the era of Jana Sangh
 bijepi vartmaan aarakshan niti ke sanvaidhanik punarvichaar ke paksh main nahin he
 The bjp's fear is more apparent from the statement, as the party has twice mentioned in a three-sentence statement that it does not support reconsideration of the existing reservation system
 sata rahaa nuksaan kaa daraspashtikaran ke baavjood bijepi bhaybheet he
 The main reason for his fear is the slipping of backward and extremely backward votes in Bihar, due to which the party has created the electoral social equation in Bihar
 lalu-nitish lagaataar sangh pramukh ke bayaan ko aage rakhkar hauva khadaa karne kii koshish kar rahe hai ki bijepi ke aate hi pichhadon ke aarakshan par kanchi chal sakati he
 There is uneasiness in the BJP in the manner in which Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has thrown out the bjp's Sangh chief
 mahagathbandhan ke ummidavaaron kaa elaan karte hue nitish ne tanj ksaa ki bijepi main itani takat nahin he ki vah sangh kii baton ko nakaar de
 He said, "bhagwat wants a second constitutional system in which a committee of elite people should be formed to decide who should be given reservation and for how long
 yani sarkaar nahin, ek cameti aarakshan tay kare
 Seeing the same strategy of the opposition, Amit Shah himself reached Patna on 22 September and he repeated the party's statement on the issue of reservation from the public stage
 vivaad ke baad sabase pehle bhagwat ke bayaan par twit ke jariye safai dene vaale ram madhav india today se kehete hai, ''sarasanghachaalak kaa jo intervyuu tha, usko galat dhang se pesh karne kaa prayaas hua tha
 The Sangh also confirmed that the Sarsanghchalak did not comment on the present reservation system
 party kaa rukh yahi rahaa he ki vartmaan paristhiti main aarakshan kii vyavastha lagu rahani chahie
 This is definitely what Sarsanghchalak Ji said and every person feels that this system is called Dr
 ambedkar jis uddeshy se laae the ki samaaj ke vanchit varg main aakhri vyakti tak iskaa laabh pahunchnaa chahie, us par vichaar hona chahie
 Therefore, it is unfortunate to make this statement disputed
 ''haalanki is masale par sangh ke mukhpatr panchajnya ke sampadak hitesh shankar bihar chunaav ke samay is intervyuu ko lekar uth rahe sawaal par kehete hai, ''sangh kaa kaam mausam dekhakar nahin hota
 The interview we have published is in the context of Integral Human Philosophy and we have no comment on who explained it outside
 lekin itnaa jarur he ki agar intervyuu ko puure sandarbh main padhaa jaae to saaf he ki saamaajik muddon par raajnneeti beparda hui he
 The title of the interview itself is a question of political parties and the political group should tell whether they agree with it or not
 ''aakhir kya he sangh kii ranneeti?pichde varg main shaamil kar aarakshan dene ko lekar patel, jat sangharsh sadakon par aa chukaa he
 The Sangh Parivar is worried about the manner in which Hardik Patel has collected millions of people in Gujarat recently and to include Patel among the backward class of the world's wealthy society
 sangh parivaar se jude ek varisht netaa bataate hai, ''sangh hameshaa ek raashtra ke rup main sochataa he or sajaateey samaaj kii baat karne vaala har shaks yaa sanghathan vahi kahegaa, jo sarasanghachaalak ne kaha he
 "he argues that in the US today, only the Patels dominate the hotel-motel business, yet why the demand for reservation?" But BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav says on the rising demands of some communities to include them in the backward classes, "such topics have been arising from time to time, governments have been seeking solutions in the national interest through dialogue with the concerned class
 rajasthan main hua, baaki jagah bhi
 Negotiations will be attempted to find a solution
 ''sangh kii chintaa yah bhi he ki samaaj or desh ke liye mahaan kaary karne vaali vibhootiyon kii jayanti log jati ke naam par manaate hai, jo saamaajik abhishaap he
 Since its inception, the Sangh has never held any conference in the name of caste
 sangh kaa maananaa he ki satta ke liye rajnatik logon ne jati ke naam par saamaajik abhishaap ko badhaava diya or vartmaan paridrishy main yah kaise khatm hoga or isaki shuruyaat koun karegaa, isaki koi tasviir nahin dikhti
 According to sources, the Union strategy has OBC reservation which V
 pi
 Started with the Mandal Commission during the Singh government
 sangh chahta he ki pichhadon ke aarakshan par gaharaai se samiksha kii jaae
 However, the Sangh's thinking on dalit-adivasi reservation is somewhat soft
 sangh kaa maananaa he ki sadiyon se saamaajik anyaay ke shikaar logon ko sahaara dena kisi bhi raashtra kaa dharm he, lekin us aad main siyaasi goti feet karnaa galat he
 The Sangh wants that creamy layer should be made in SC-ST reservation so that those who are still left backward can be brought forward
 sangh kii daleel he ki aarakshan ko lekar ek rashtravyapee bahes khadi honi chahie or bhagwat kaa bayaan usee sandarbh main he
 But one leader believes that this does not seem to be happening right now
 lekin bhagwat ke bayaan ke mantavya par ve kehete hai, ''sarasanghachaalak ji ne swayamsevakon ko ek disha de di he ki ve log isi tarah bolen
 "this intention has been put forward by the Sangh's subsidiary organization VHP
 lekin sangh parivaar kii duvidha he ki rajnatik kshetra main kaam karne vaala uskaa vaicharik sanghathan bijepi kisi bhi surat main aarakshan kii samiksha kaa samarthan nahin kar saktaa
 Clearly, the Sangh Parivar's dilemma regarding reservation is clearly visible, but the BJP is currently trying to gauge the loss in the Bihar Assembly on the dispute arising out of the statement of the Sangh chief
 tamilnadu main nagpattinam sthit badrakaliaman mandir kaa paanch divasiy vashirk mahotsav jila prashasan ne sthagit kar diya he kyonki mandir mahotsav aayojan ko lekar utpann vivaad ke samaadhaan ke liye daliton or unchi jati ke hinduon ke bich hui baithak asafal rahi
 District Collector Pazhaniswamy said today, "the district administration tried to find a amicable solution to the issue
" yadhyapi chunki kal yojit baatcheet anirnaayak rahi, hamaare paas is varsh ke mahotsav ko sthagit karne ke alaava anya koi vikalp nahin tha
 "he said," a case in this regard is already pending in the Madras High Court
 jab tak adaalat kaa faisla nahin aa jaataa, mahotsav sthagit rahegaa
 District administration officials started talks after the news that Dalits of Kalimedu village threatened that they would accept Islam if they were not given the right to perform the rituals throughout the day
 baithak ke dauraan prashasan ne teen suzav diye jisamen mahotsav ke dinon kii sankhya paanch se badhaakar chah karnaa shaamil tha taaki samudaay ko ek puure din anushthan karne kaa mauka mili
 However, the high caste Hindus rejected the suggestion citing various reasons
 yadhyapi unhone kaha ki unhen daliton dwaara vashirk mahotsav ke dinon ke alaava kisi or din anushthan karne par koi aapatti nahin he
 More than 200 Dalits of Kalimedu have long been demanding the right to conduct the festival in the ancient temple during the Tamil month of 'aadi'

 vaigyanikon ne vajan ghataane main madadgaar ek aisi computer chip kaa avishkaar kar liya he jise kisi mote vyakti ke sharir main implant kiya ja saktaa he
 This chip will continuously check the fat present in the blood and if someone eats more then it will release a hormone that will calm the appetite
 is chip ke puraane varjan kii jaanch mote chuhon par kii gai
 During the investigation, it was observed that the rats started eating less fatty food and their weight also decreased
 or jab chuhon kaa vajan normal ho gaya to chip ne bhukh shant karne vaala hormone jari karnaa bhi band kar diya
 Researchers in Switzerland hope that within five to 10 years they will produce a version of this chip that is shaped like a coin and can be implanted into the arms of humans

 lok lekha samiti (piesi) kii hangaamedaar baithak main adhyaksh murali manohar joshi congressi sadasyon ke jabardast virodh ke kaaran 2ji spectrum maamle se judi report nahin rakh sake
 However, the DMK and BSP members along with the NDA supported it to be placed before the committee for consideration
 baithak ke baad joshi ne kaha ki is vishay main paksh or vipaksh main kai tarah ke vichaar saamne aae jisamen kai niyamon evam dishanirdeshon kaa hawala diya gaya

 Having a big name and a similar name can also be a source of trouble, something that happened to SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav when he faced a challenge from his nominees on several occasions
 pehali baar 1989 main hua isamulaayam ko varsh 1989 main pehali baar apni vaastavik matadaata pahchaan sthapit karne ke liye pita ke naam sughad singh kaa sahaara lenaa padaa tha kyonki jaswantnagar vidhansabha kshetra se unheen kii namrashi vaale vyakti ne unhen chunauti di thi, yahi halaat saal 1991 or saal 1993 ke chunaav main bhi rahe
 Mulayam became MLA for the first time in the year 1967, in total he was an MLA eight times
 chunaav ayog ke aankade dekhen to varsh 1989 menjanta dal ne mulaayam singh yadavaputra sughad singh ko chunaav maidan main utaara tha
 Another Mulayam Singh Yadav (independent) stood by him but his father's name was Patiram
 mulaayam ko us samay 65 hajaar 597 vot mili the jabaki unke namrashi vaale pratidwandvi ko maatr 1032 vot hasil hue the
 The same situation was in 1991, when he won from Mulayam Jaswantnagar seat on Janata Party ticket, he won 47 thousand 765 votes while his nominee got only 328 votes
 isi chunaav main bhi ek anya mulaayam singh najar aaye wo bhi nirdaleey ummidavaar ke rup main, unhone barauli vidhansabha seat se lade, ye naye mulaayam 218 vot hi hasil kar paye
 In the 1993 assembly elections also, Doharaya History, Mulayam contested three seats of Uttar Pradesh, Jaswant Nagar (etawah), Shikohabad (firozabad) and Nidhauli Kalan (etah) on the SP ticket and won all three seats in the 1993 assembly elections
 is samay tak sapa kaa gathan ho chukaa tha or ram mandir andolan ke baad chunaav hue the
 It is another matter that Mulayam had to face a challenge from his nominees in all three assembly seats
 jaswant nagar main mulaayam ko 60 hajaar 242 mat mili jabaki unki namrashi vaale nirdaleey ummidavaar ko keval 192 mat hasil hue
 In Shikohabad, Mulayam got 55 thousand 249 votes while his nominee Independent candidate got only 154 votes, Mulayam Singh Yadav in Nidhaulikalan got 41 thousand 683 votes while his nominee independents got only 184 votes
 barauli seat (aligarh) se mulaayam singh sehara (nirdaleey) ko maatr 164 mat mili
 Even if he won the Lok Sabha ticket, in the year 1985 elections, Mulayam won from Jaswantnagar seat on Lokdal's ticket, contested with Mulayam Auraiya named him but got only 292 votes
 mulaayam singh yadav varsh 1980 kaa vidhansabha chunaav jaswantnagar se haar gayi
 He contested from Chaudhary Charan Singh-led Janata Dal (secular)
 unki namrashi vaale pratidwandi indian neshnal congress (you) ke tikat par bharthana se lade the or keval 2367 vot paa sake
 Interestingly, even before Mulayam Singh Yadav entered Uttar Pradesh's electoral politics, Independent Mulayam Singh contested from Gunnore North seat in 1951 and got 2944 votes, Mulayam Singh Yadav fought both Gunnore and Bharthana seats in the year 2007
 And live also
 1969 vidhansabha chunaav main mulaayam singh yadav jaswantnagar seat par duusare number par the
 Mulayam Singh Yadav won from Jaswantnagar in the year 1974 on the Bharatiya Kranti Dal ticket and won the Janata Party (JNP) ticket from the same seat in 1977
 kashmir kii sard hawaaon ko modi-lone kii mulaaqaat ne garm kar diya he
 As Lone himself says, he has been coming to Delhi before and met leaders, but then there was not such a big news
 is baar ban rahi he to iske kai myne hai
 First little Sajjad knows about Lone
 sajaad lone kashmir ke koi bahut bade netaa nahin hai
 His image has changed and changed from a separatist leader to a leader who joins the political mainstream
 2008 main amarnath zamin vivaad ke samay kashmir mudde ke hal kii awaz ban kar tivi dibet main chhaae rahe
 His native district of Kashmir, Kupwara, he has a very large base which is mainly inherited from him
 2009 ye khud or 2014 main inke ummidavaar loksabhaa chunaav haar chuke hai
 Sajjad Lone is the son of elder Kashmiri leader Abdul Ghani Lone
 abdul gani lone 1990 ke baad hurriyat conference kaa hissaa bane, lekin apane udaaravaadi rukh ke chalate kattarwadiyon se unki anban rahi
 He was assassinated on 21 May 2002 during a rally at Idgah ground in Srinagar
 pita kii hatya ke baad algaavvaadi hurriyat conference se sajaad lone kaa bilgau hua
 He turned to mainstream politics
 2002 ke chunaav main inkaa proxi ummidavaar jeeta
 The Hurriyat expelled him and his party People's Conference from his alliance
 pipuls conference is vidhansabha chunaav main kupwada-handwara kii 12 siton par lard rahi he
 This time in the Kashmir Valley, Mehbooba Mufti and her party PDP are being emphasized
 sajaad lone akele apane boote kashmir kii raajnneetik phiza badalane main koi kaarak sabit nahin ho sakate
 It is also difficult to say how many seats they will be able to take out in 12
 kashmir ke chunavi dangal main koi unhen bada pahalwaan nahin maan rahaa isliye media bhi ek seemaa ke aage unhen vajan nahin detaa
 But, his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi has brought him into the limelight
 darasal 44 plus kaa mishan lekar chal rahi bijepi ko kashmir ghati main apana pair jamaane kii darkaar he
 This is needed along with local Kashmiri leaders to break the party's rigid Hinduist image
 iske zariye party ghati main apni sweekaaryata kaa dhindhora peet sakati he
 Sajjad can provide this opportunity to the loan party
 jo kabhi algaavaadi netaa rahaa ho wo agar bijepi ke saath hota he, to party na sirf ise kashmir main balki puure desh main bhunaa sakegi
 The party will be able to project this as a new rise of nationalism under Modi's leadership
 ise apana 'healing tach' kah sakegi
 "they met with warmth
" baatcheet main laga, ve nahin main pradhanmantri hum
 He listened carefully to everything
 kashmir ke liye kuch khaas he unke dil main'' modi se mulaaqaat ke baad lone ke aise bayaan bijepi ko seenaa chaudaa karne kaa mauqaa de bhi rahe hai
 The BJP is confident that they will do better in Jammu where there are 37 seats
 asal chunauti ghati 46 siton par he
 Being on the bjp's side of Lone will help break the concept that 'no Sunni Muslim leader of the Valley with his own political heritage' can ever think of BJP and this BJP also cannot extend its hand to 'ever-separatist Muslims' 
 bijepi lone ke saath aane se kinaaron par khadey logon ko isse ek rasta milegaa
 There are also a large number of people in the valley who are searching for a new option, who are left and frustrated by the rule of NC and PDP
 unke liye ye nayaa vikalp sidhe taur par bijepi nahin ho saktaa, or naa hi 'bade qad kaa netaa nahin' hone ke kaaran ve lone par hi daanv laga sakate hai
 But, 'alliance with a national party' can add weight to the talk of the loan, so that voters can come to it
 akhir kashmiriyon kii pareshaani or samasyaon ke hawaale se centre se behatar talmail or madad kii aas main hi to faruk-umr abdulla yaa mufti mohammad-mehabooba dilli kii sarkaar ke qareeb jate rahe hai
 Lone can talk of giving such an option for them in his own right
 beshak ve ghati ke umr abdulla yaa mehabooba mufti na hon
 But the BJP can put 'electoral logistics' behind Sajjad Lone and his party to take them closer to greater success
 bijepi ne abhi se lone kii party kii kam se kam chah siton par jeet kaa akalan kar liya he
 Only then has the state unit of the party reduced its mission 44+ to 50+
 maharaja hari singh ke pote or congress netaa karn singh ke bete ajatshatru singh ko bijepi main shaamil kar wo pehle hi ek raajnneetik sandesh de chuki he
 Overall, the BJP is trying to win the big race by betting on a small horse
 modi-lone mulaaqaat ne navbanr disambar ke barfbaari ke maheenon main ghati main aisi chunavi sargarmi paidaa kii he jisase kai unnat chotiyon kii barf pigal sakati he
 In Maharashtra's Nashik district, the Excise Department team took around 1

 Just then, a truck showed up at a fast exit
 jise team ne roak liya
 Excise Inspector YR Savkhedkar said that when the truck was stopped and searched, it was brought in huge quantities of illegal liquor from the state from Madhya Pradesh
 aabkaari vibhaag ke sachal daste ne trek se avaidh sharaab ke 1,192 dibbe jabt kiye
 Which contained bottles of wine
 iske baad fouran baad trek chaalak samet do logon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya

 While many foldable smartphones were showcased during the Mobile World Congress, but China's company Royole actually gave people here to use foldable smartphones
 haalanki is company ne 2018 main hi ise launch kiya tha, lekin bharat main nahin aayaa he or abhi bhi ye prototip se ek kadam hi aage he
 However, we have used it and tried to know how these foldable smartphones work

 Royole flexpai was also shown at computer electronic shows but it was quite strange then
 ab isamen kaaphi badlaav kiye gaye hai or ye alag he

 haalanki phone ke yujar interphes main lag he or yuj karne main thik nahin lagata
 It still needs more improvement
 isamen android besd oes diya gaya he
 However, after folding, you will be able to use only one side of the screen
 company ke mutabik aane vaale samay main isamen impruvement kiya jayega or phir fold karne ke baad isaki donon taraf kii disple ko aap yuj kar paaenge
 There is a hinge in the back of the phone, which makes it difficult to use the phone
 kyonki hinj kii jagah rabar jaisaa feel hota he or ye ubhara hua he
 It also has to be improved
 company kaa kahana he ki keemat bahut badi cheez he or isse kam keemat par zyada logon ke liye launch karnaa kapani lakshya he
 Talking about the specifications of this smartphone, it has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor and has an 8-inch screen
 iske do verients hai – 6GB ram ke saath 128GB memory he, jabaki duusare verient main 8GB ram ke saath 256GB kii memory he
 It can be increased to 256GB via micro SD card
 photography ke liye isamen dual camera diya gaya he jo 16 or 5 megapixl kaa he
 However, there is no selfie camera, because by folding the smartphone, you can also click the selfie
 isamen dual sim connactivity he or bydaree 3970mah kii he
 The fingerprint scanner has been given on the side panel of this smartphone

 saumya ke dimag main khaali baithkar yah sawaal uth rahaa tha ki kya vah job chhodkar ghar baith jaae yaa phir ghar main rahakar hi koi kaam shuru kare
 In the life of this couple, working in different countries, both of them had no time for each other
 kamasutra main kis-kis tarah ke 'kis' |'kamasutra' main kya he
 
 
 If both the jobs are done in pairs and it is necessary for both of them, then it is also very difficult to maintain distance with each other for such a long time
 taaki 'relationships' main bani rahe taazgi

 You can thank technology for this

 Twinkle Khanna is known for her funny comments
 is baar tvikal ne eks ankar or republic tivi ke ko-founder aranab goswami par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Actually, Arnab's promo is getting very popular these days, in which he is seen writing letters to Arvind Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi
 in promose ko aranab ke fain bahut pasand kar rahe hai or soshal media par ise bahut share bhi kiya ja rahaa he, lekin kuch log iske virodh main bhi hai
 Some people say that Arnab, who is not in power, is raising his voice against them

 Twinkle has captioned this video, instead of writing a letter, Arnab should try these moves in his next video
 Instead of writing letters perhaps Arnab should try incorporating these less ambiguous moves in his next video # cutcutcuta post shared by Twinkle Khanna (@twinklerkhanna) onapr 30, 2017 at 11:29pm pdtbawa den ki online or ofline donon hi jagah aranab kii tagdi fain folowing he or aranab ke khilaaf bolne vaale logon par wo log jamkar hamalaa bhi karte hai

 congress netaa prithviraj chavaan ne kaha ki 2014 or 2019 main congress kaa pradarshan loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaavon main kharaab rahaa
 However, he admitted that the Congress party has not died
 agar mar gai hoti to teen rajyon- madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main chunaav kaise jitati
 "the performance in the election was poor", he said, "our performance in 2014 was bad
 hamaara leadership bhi gadabad rahi he
 He lashed out at the BJP
 jab unase poocha gaya ki unke netaa vipaksh radhakrishna vikhe patil bijepi main shaamil hokar mantri ban gaye
 What kind of opposition is this? On this, he said that the Shiv Sena never opposed the cabinet decision
 wo karte bhi nahin
 The issue of leader opposition was serious
 ho saktaa he ki vipaksh ke netaa ko manage kiya gaya ho
 After 'BJP adopting the policy of sam-daam', Chavan was asked that people of Congress and NCP are going to BJP and Shiv Sena, how do you see this? In response to this, he said, Congress has seen this many times
 ye bijepi or shivasena kii ranneeti kaa hissaa ho saktaa he
 This is also the case of Amit Shah
 ve kehete hai ki desh ko congress mukt karnaa he
 The BJP is taking people with them by following the policy of Sama, Daam, Dand, Bhed
 pad or paise ofer kar rahi he
 This is the political corruption of Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis
 agar hamane kuch galat kiya to ham use bhugat rahe hai, ve bhi bhugtenge
 'will raise the issue of unemployment and falling economy' After this, Chavan was asked whether we are now becoming single party and two-people democracy
 There is no choice before the voters
 congress kaise ise badalegi? is par chavaan ne kaha, bijepi vipaksh ko hi khatm karnaa chaahati he
 That single party is heading to the rule
 unhone kaha ki ham chunaav main berogari, girti iconomi or taanaashaahee jaise muddon ko lekar utrenge or voters ko jaagruk karenge
 Significantly, the assembly elections will be held on October 21 in 288 seats in Maharashtra
 nateezon kaa elaan 24 oktober ko kiya jayega

 osman khwaaja ko is tarah out die jane par purv australian cricketer shen worne ne kaha ki yah unke dekhe gaye ab tak ke sabase bure faislon main se ek he
 
 
 It is worth noting that after the decision was given by the on-field umpire against him, Usman Khwaja demanded DRS, but after that Kumar Dharmasena watched everything on TV with the help of hot-spot technology, and still the mistake Have done

 In the changed political scenario, the Jats turned to Congress in the 2008 assembly elections
 lekin congress main rajputon ke asar ke chalate jat is baar phir se bijepi ke bare main sochane lage
 Vasundhara Raje's words welcoming everyone to the party at the Jaipur event were, "I am the daughter-in-law of your society
" mere saath aakar mere haath majboot kiijie
 "bjp's national vice president Satpal Malik present there, Ajay Singh, president of All India Jat Mahasabha, INLD MLA Abhay Chautala in Haryana became witness to this political event
" upie-1 main videsh mantri jaise mahatvapurn pad par rahe natwar singh ke bijepi kii ore badaae kii ghatana ne pradesh kii raajnneeti kaa cheharaa badal diya he
 This family had been marginalized in state politics for a long time
 congress ke saath rahakar is gharaane kaa punaruddhar asambhav dikh rahaa tha
 That is why in the election year, Natwar Singh caught the BJP
 bhale hi ve 83 varsh ke ho chuke hon par yah bhi sach he ki rajaneta ke liye umr aade nahin aati
 The example of Nagaur veteran Nathuram Mirdha is in front
 khaat par maranasann avasthaa main hone kii vajah se vot maangane ke liye ve kahin nahin gaye lekin jite the baari faasale se
 Mirdha is no more, but in the last parliamentary elections, her name is definitely known - Baba Ri granddaughter, Nagaur re Jyoti
 is slogan se jyoti mirdha par bahari yaa parachuti netaa hone kaa daag nahin laga or ve maje se jeetin
 Natwar Singh knows all these things and Raje too
 hari singh ke bijepi main aane kaa ishaara to pichley dinon nagaur ke googhadwad main hue krishi mahakme ke ek kaarykram main hi mil gaya tha
 Among the thousands of farmers present in this, Hari Singh had fiercely raged against Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and Congress
 isse tay ho gaya tha ki yah gut ab congress kaa rukh to nahin hi karegaa
 Hear his words on this occasion, "congress was our mother, now she is dead
" marane ke baad to sharir ko jalaayaa jaataa he
 "the resentment was no less against Gehlot," "if Jats have a big enemy, that is Ashok Gehlot
" pichley chunaavon main jat netaa vahiin haare, jahaan maalion ke vot sabase zyada the
 "singh then calls Gehlot the biggest racist face
" nagaur ke kaarykram ke baad hari singh ke aage raste ke bare main to andaja lag hi gaya tha, bas intjaar tha sahi maukey kaa
 That opportunity also came on the pretext of diamond jubilee
 to kya or bhi kuch jat congressi bijepi main aa rahe hai? is sawaal par bijepi ke pradesh mahaamantri satish puniyaan kehete hai, ''gahalot ko lekar congress ke kuch jat netaaon main virodh he
 Two or four such names are under discussion
 dekhte hai aage
 "that means there are more possibilities now
" gauratlab he ki kisaan chatravaas ke hirak jayanti aayojan par pradesh ke diggaj jat netaa, shekhavati ke shishram ola bhi aane vaale the lekin ain maukey par baat nahin baniin
 Ola has also been a strong opponent of Gehlot from the beginning
 virodh itnaa prakhar he ki ola bhi congress se chhitak jaaen to achambhe vaali baat nahin hogi
 Despite Gehlot's reluctance, Ola's son Brijendra Ola is in Gehlot's cabinet
 kuchhek maheene kii hi baat he, nahar ke mudde ko lekar senior ola gahalot sarkaar ke khilaaf dharne par baith gaye the jabaki nahar mantri unke bete hi hai
 Obviously, Ola's aim was to target Gehlot
 bikaner ke diggaj congressi rameshwar dudi bhi pichley dinon gahalot ko aankh dikhaa chuke hai
 He attended a program in Bikaner involving Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay
 itnaa hi nahin, vaakayada 'do shabd' bole bhi or jamkar photo bhi khinchvaai
 Though Doody is denying any possibility of joining the BJP, the veteran leader, who is in the midst of the thorns and hot flames, cannot be taken lightly for any party-specific event
 dudi kii naaraazgi bhi jagajaahir he
 Gehlot made Nokha MLA Kanhaiya Lal Jhanwar a minister who defeated Doody
 aise main dudi agar karavat badalte hai to badi baat na hogi
 Colonel Sonaram is also seen dropping arrows at his meetings etc
 for Gehlot to be anti-jat, while the relationship of Nagaur veteran Congressman Harendra Mirdha is not being described as very good with Gehlot
 lekin bijepi ko bhi kisi mugalate main nahin rahanaa chahie
 If she is thinking that changing the equation due to Hari Singh joining BJP or expressing support for Natwar Singh, then it will be her mistake
 diggaj jat netaa narayan singh congress or mukhyamantri ashok gahalot kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 Now it will be interesting to see who the Raje candidates make
 jaaton yaa duusari jatiyon main bhi congress kaa janaadhar itnaa bhi kamjor nahin hua he ki bijepi ko satta parosi hui mil jaae
 Gehlot has focused very deeply on populist schemes and his chief secretary is following the officers and implementing these schemes 
 sach he ki gahalot ke liye sthitiyaan bahut acchhee nahin hai lekin yahi baat bijepi par bhi lagu hoti he
 Whether it is from the Jat belt or other circles, the fight will be interesting
 ‘‘ham gendbaaj ko nahin, gend kii khubi-khami ko dekhte hue khelte hai
 "south African bowler Vernon Philander, who created Indian batting, had a pinch two days before the start of the first Test
 ve asal main bataa rahe the ki bharat main haal hi khelkar gaye srilankai khilaadi bharatiyon ke starpane ke rob or hauvve main haidas gaye
 And that African players do not come in any such hovewe
 sach baat he, ve aate bhi nahin
 Interestingly, during India's batting tour of Africa in 2001-02, Tendulkar had told Sehwag on the middle pitch during the batting that you are looking at the ball, not the bowler
 par ab to yah saaf hi ho gaya he ki africa main sirf gend ko bhi dekhakar khelnaa itnaa aasaan nahin hota
 And when things do not remain so easy, it is bound for someone to fret, even if they are captain Virat Kohli
 ve ek romani safar par the
 The tour of South Africa may be exciting for the Indian team and Indian audience, it is also romantic for them
 bahut dinon baad unhen team kii khaamiyon par ungali uthaani padi he, varna abhi tak hindustan main sab kuch maje main sab chal rahaa tha
 No one comes, beat, rob you
 ghar kii pichen hai
 The way Kohli has been batting on the batsmen after the 72-run defeat to Africa, there are some indications
 abhi do test baaki hai or africa bharat ko siries jeetne to nahin denge, yah baat kareeb-kareeb tay he
 After the restored cricket ties since 1992-93, out of the 6 series that have been held so far, India have lost only one, and have missed one level
 to ab yaheen se kohli se kohli banane kii kahani shuru honi he, or usee mode par yah jhallahat! unamem dussahas he, yah baat do saal pehle australia main us vakt pataa chal gai thi jab drow sa maan liye jane vaale test match ko unhone jeetne ke iraade se khelnaa shuru kiya
 He was a great moment
 bhartiya captain amuman is tarah ke saahasik, balki kahen ki dussahasik faislon ke liye to nahin hi jane jate
 India lost that Test but Kohli was praised
 tab ve asthaayee captain hi the lekin unke us kadam ne ek tarah se unki captaini philosphy kaa mujahiraa kar diya
 Last year in India itself, the way Australian captain Steve Smith's third umpire took the offensive and attacked Smith directly, he also confirmed his philosophy
 dam todate se or ekatarfa-se chalate aa rahe test cricket ke daur main bharat kaa dakshin africa daura hi vah mukaam he, jo kohli ko samakaleen mahanon ke frem main feet kar saktaa he
 This work is like lifting a mountain in the true sense
 isko aise samajhen ki bhartiya ballebaaji kii ridh samajhe jane vaale or videshon main khaase kaamyaab rahul dravid bhi 1996 se 2011 tak vahaan ke chaar dauron main 11 test kii 22 pariyon main sirf ek shatak laga paae or aksar khaase kam score par out hue hai
 Sachin Tendulkar must have scored five centuries in five series from 1992 to 2011
 yah alag baat he ki jin maichon main unhone shatak lagaae, unamem yaa to bharat haara yaa match drow hue
 Obviously, if Kohli is being compared to Sachin, then the same thing should be seen in his game and statistics as well
 capatoun match se agar kuch sakaaratmak lene kii baat he to vah yah ki yahaan bharat kii haar kaa faasla 72 ran kaa rahaa he
 And even though the five-day match was over before three days, his repeated panache kept the audience in his fists
 test cricket main jaan daalane ke liye yah jaruri rasayan he
 Otherwise, see where there is a problem with some team
 ashes main australia ne england ko naak ragad-ragadqar pani pilaayaa
 There are no such matches
 What the audience has to do with the records
 africa main bharat aksar 200, 300 ranon yaa viketon ke bade faasale se aksar haara he
 This match has raised hopes that further matches can be a thorn
 palada 60-40 yaa 55-45 ke anupaat main rahe to match main jaan rahati he
 Now there will be heat in this series
 kohli ko is baat kaa bhi khyaal rakhana hoga ki unki parformens kharaab hui to bhartiya darshakon kaa najla un par hi nahin, unki ardhangini anoushka sharma par bhi gir saktaa he kyonki kuch log iske liye anoushka se unki shaadi ko bhi kasuurvaar tehraane se baj nahin aaenge
 So after the first Test, the perception is that the matches will be very thorny that a lot is at stake
 rahi africa main test siries jeetne kii baat, to

 rahul gandhi ne CII ke sammelan main apane bhaashan ke dauraan narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki jab bhi aap samudaayon ko alag karne kii raajnneeti karenge, desh kaa bahut bada nuksaan hoga
 Rahul Gandhi said that the politics of hate can never benefit the country
 unhone kaha, 'nafrat or kuch samudaay ko peeche chhod dene se kabhi madad nahin milegi
 Leaving behind some community in the country is a big loss for the country
 hamen sabko saath lekar chalanaa hoga
 Congress' vision is equality

 The central government has said that 3 amendments are needed in this bill
 aatank se nipatane ke liye narendra modi sarkaar ne is bill ko centre ke paas bheja tha
 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi continues to accuse the central government of adopting step-motherly behavior regarding this bill
 modi kaa kahana he ki gujacoka bill bhi macoka kii tarah hi ek kanoon he
 If MCOCA is used to fight terror in Mumbai then why is there no such bill being passed in Gujarat

 The Supreme Court has asked the Central Board of Direct Taxes CBDT to file an affidavit by September 12 in connection with unaccounted election expenses of candidates during elections

 The pseudo secularism is in the air nowadays
 koun dharmanirpeksh he or koun sampradayik, iskaa certificate baantne kaa theka hamaare siyasatdanon ne le liya he
 So far, the Congress party, which has given certificates of secularism to others, has been described as communal by BJP President Rajnath Singh
 rajnath singh ne aarope lagaaya he ki vaaki main congress party bhi secular nahin he isi vajah se mahatma gandhi aazaadee ke baad is party ko bhang kar dena chaahate the
 According to the BJP president, the Congress divided the society into several parts by doing politics on the 'divide and rule' policy of the British
 unhone sabhi dharmik samudaayon ko chetaya ki congress ke is chehre se batch ke rahane kii jarurat he
 After giving the certificate of communalism to the Congress, Rajnath Singh described his party as secular
 unhone kaha ki jin rajyon main bijepi kii sarkaar rahi he vahaan dharmikadwesh kii vaaradaaten kam hui hai
 Rajnath Singh said, 'india is a secular country

 aisa kisne kiya har koi jaanata he
 Rajnath Singh called the UPA the most corrupt government ever

 Before the match, Team India captain Virat Kohli described the day-night test as a historic opportunity
 unhone kaha tha ki 'pink ball test hamaare liye chunauti he lekin iske saath hi yah romaanchak bhi hoga
 He said that i cannot say on behalf of the other team or the board, but for the last few years we were talking to the BCCI on the issue of improving Test cricket

 The trailer of this film based on the historical character is being well liked
 film main ajay devgan ke saath kaajol (kajol) bhi mukhya kirdaar main najar aa rahi hai
 Let me tell you, in the film, Ajay Devgan is seen in the role of Subedar Tanaji Malusare, the commander of Chhatrapati Shivaji
 film main ajay devgan ek yoddha ke kirdaar ko bakhubi nibhaa rahe hai
 Rishi Kapoor's tweet went viral, wrote- Does he consider himself Dara Singh?

 film main ajay devgan or kaajol ke alaava saf ali khan (saif Ali Khan), pankaj treepathi (pankaj Tripathi) or sharad kelkar bhi mukhya bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 Let me tell you, this film of Ajay Devgan will be released on January 10 next year

 sharad pavaar ne mantralay bantwaare par diya bada bayaanpavaar bole- dipti siem ke paas koi adhikaar nahin hotagaiabandhan formule main ensipi ko mila he dipti siemmaharashtra main lambii jaddojahad or phul siyaasi drame ke baad uddhav thakare ke netritv main shivasena-ensipi-congress gathbandhan kii sarkaar to ban gai, lekin ab bantwaare par bayaanbaji bhi shuru ho gai he
 Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) President Sharad Pawar, who emerged as the biggest kingmaker in bringing the three parties together, has given a twist on the matter by giving a statement on the sharing of ministries
 ajtak ko die intervyuu main pavaar ne kaha he ki ensipi ke paas dipti siem he, jiske paas koi adhikaar nahin hota
 Sharad Pawar's statement is very important because the Congress and NCP have supported the Shiv Sena to keep the BJP away from power in Maharashtra
 teenon dalon ke bich haalanki sarkaar chalaane ke liye ek kaaman minimum program banaaya gaya he, lekin mantralayon kaa bantwaaraa abhi tak nahin ho sakaa he
 Uddhav Thackeray has been sworn in as the Chief Minister, while he was accompanied by two ministers from each of the three parties
 gathbandhan formule main NCP ko mila dipti siemhalanki, gathbandhan formule ke tahat ensipi ko dipti siem kaa pad diya gaya he, lekin ab tak is par kisi kii niyukti nahin ho saki he
 Also, the Uddhav cabinet has not been expanded yet
 charchaa he ki mantralayon ko lekar antim sahmati nahin ban pai he
 When Sharad Pawar was questioned in the interview, he directly threw the ball into the court of Shiv Sena and Congress
 dipti siem ke paas koi adhikaar nahin hota- sharad pavarsharad pavaar ne kaha ki mantralay ko lekar unki party ensipi or shivasena ke bich koi jhagada nahin he
 It is between the Congress and the NCP
 pavaar ne kaha ki ensipi ke paas shivasena se do siten kam hai, jabaki congress se 10 siten zyada hai
 He said, 'shiv Sena has a chief minister while Congress has a speaker
 lekin meri party ko kya mila
 The deputy CM has no authority
 'pavaar kaa yah bayaan roteshnal siem kii charchaaon ko bhi jor dene vaala he
 In fact, during the formation of the joint government of Maha Vikas Aghadi after the agreement between the three parties, there was a discussion that the NCP wanted a rotational CM for two-and-a-half years
 khud sharad pavaar ne saarvajanik taur par kaha tha ki shivasena or ensipi ke bich dhai-dhai saal siem ko lekar baat hui thi
 However, when the government was formed, it was clearly stated on behalf of the Shiv Sena that the Shiv Sena CM would be the full five years
 ab jabaki uddhav sarkaar ne kaam shuru kar diya he to sharad pavaar ne ensipi ke khate main aae dipti siem ke pad ko kamjor bataaya he
 In such a situation, it will also be interesting to see whether the NCP makes its deputy CM or another twist comes in Maharashtra

 Justice Rajeev Shakdhar questioned the petition while hearing an application filed by the terrorist organization ISIS in the Delhi High Court regarding 39 Indians killed in Mosul, Iraq
 unhone kaha ki is puraani yachika main nai arji se koi lenaa- dena nahi he
 The court told the petitioner that they have nothing to do with preventing them from going to Mosul and killing 39 people there
 court ne yachikakarta se kaha ki yaa to vah yachika khaarij karen yaa phir vah yachika waapas len or uske paas phir se daayar karne kaa adhikaar he
 Advocate Mahmud Pracha has withdrawn his petition in view of the court's stand
 ab vahayachika main sudharkar phir se janhit yachika daayar karenge
 Let me tell you that in the petition of Mahmud Pracha it has been told that in November 2014, a group of social activists and Muslim leaders were going to Iraq to work with the local people to campaign against terror
 is dal main yachikakarta khud bhi shaamil the
 The Iraqi government also approved it, but the central government did not let them go
 mahmud praachaa ke mutabik 24 november, 2014 ko jab vah apane dal ke saath iraq jane ke liye airport pahunche to unhen roak diya gaya
 He was told that a lookout notice was issued against him
 mahmud praachaa ne apni arji main kaha he ki centre sarkaar auravidesh mantralay ke adhikariyonki laaparvaahee kii vajah se mosul main 39 bharatiyon kii jaan gai
 In such a case, the court should order a judicial inquiry into the whole matter
 mahmud praachaa kaa daawa he ki unhen iraq jane se isliye roka gaya tha taaki sarkaar kii sachai saamne naa aae
 He stated that his motive behind going to Iraq was to help the Indian people held hostage by ISIS, a terrorist organization, along with the campaign against terror
 mahmud praachaa kaa aarope he ki sarkaar or videsh mantralay ke adhikariyon ne is masale par desh ko galat jaankaree dekar gumraah kiya
 Now the government is not letting the coffins (coffins holding the bodies) open, which is wrong

 The complaint has been filed in the court of fourth Additional Sessions Judge DN Mishra of Indore District Court
 See the irony that the name of the person presenting the complaint is also Digvijay, from whom senior advocate of High Court Manohar Dalal has presented the complaint in which Lokayukta or iow An order has been sought to file an FIR for research
 jaanch kar prativedan dene kaa jisaki agali taarikh solah sitambar niyat kii he
 According to senior advocate Manohar Dalal of the High Court, Digvijay Singh, who has been a disciple of Asaram, has given Asaram an illegal profit of Rs 5 crore and loss to the government while he was the chief minister
 jo ek aparaadh he
 Also, when Diggi was the Chief Minister, illegal constructions, swimming pools and shops were built in Asaram's ashram, which was not even given notice
 manohar dalal ne aage bataaya ki colector kii yah duty thi kii agar kuch galat ho rahaa he to karrwai kare, magar aisa nahin hua
 We have submitted an application in the court that under the Behavior Act, agencies like IOW and Lokayukta in the state should be ordered to file firs and submit research reports

 Gowda's injury blow to afisumariwala admitted that Gowda's injury was a blow to AFI, but expressed happiness that a record 38 athletes have qualified for the Olympics
 chot kaa matlab he ki gauda ko feet hone par kisi pratiyogita main bhaag liye bina sidhe olympic main bhaag lenaa hoga

 Between the pictures of Nitish Kumar coming with BJP leaders, there is a trend of political speculation in Bihar about which Nitish will eventually turn
 nitish se nazdikiyaan badaye BJP: sangharaamanavami kii subah nitish ne kaha ki janata parivaar ke vilay kii gaadi chal padi he
 On the night of Ramnavami in Patna, Nitish Kumar appeared on the same stage with BJP leaders wearing saffron robes
 manch par nitish, ravishankar prasad or ramvilas paswan ke saath najar aae
 Sushil Modi was also on the same platform, but the two leaders appeared to be avoiding appearing together
 haalanki mauka ramanavami kii shobhaa yatra kaa tha lekin ise siyaasi tavajjo bhi diya ja rahaa he
 Let us tell you that after meeting Narendra Modi alone in Delhi a few days ago, Nitish Kumar met Mulayam Singh Yadav, Lalu Prasad Yadav, Om Prakash Chautala and Sonia Gandhi
 unhone kejariwal se bhi khaas taur par mulaakaat kii
 In such a situation, should Nitish's campaign of unity be considered true or is he also cooking with the BJP in the interior
 haalanki is sawaal ko nitish pehle hi taal chuke hai or shanivaar ko nitish ne ye kah daalaa ki janata parivaar kaa vilay jald hoga
 However, if political circles are to be believed, there is hardly any talk of a merger or alliance between Nitish and Lalu

 'binnu! koi aadmi jahaan-tahaan yaa thodaa-modaa nahin hota
 When that happens, it is complete with its gun-totals, you know so much about us
 
 
 belabahu! parivaar kii pole khulegi lekin tumhaara chaal-chalan to jitna bhi khulegaa, logon kii dilchaspee ke liye mjedaar cheez hogi
 Whether it is society or literature or politics, the woman coming in it is considered as 'kaichi Point'
 mardon ke charitra ko koun dekhtaa he
 'the use of regional language in the book has made it more simple and fun to read
 kaise ek stri apana bachapan kho detii he, bik kar ek adhed ke changul main funs jaati he, uske baad yauvan aane par bhi use vaivaahik sukh nahin mil paata

 swabhimaan or atmasamman bhari jindagi paane ke liye sangharsh kii ye dastaan behtareen he
 Some interesting parts of the book - 'does a woman have the pleasure of eating more comfort than self-esteem? It is so difficult to maintain self-sufficiency that when he comes near a man, he starts to feel God? This is also a rite of confession of male authority
 'unke yahaan bela jaisi striyon ke liye do hi bhoomika behtareen he - aagyaakaarita or sambhogapatutaa
 Bella had these specialties, which people like Pahune found interesting
 isi adaa ko bela jaisi auraton kii sabhyataa samajha jaataa he'
 'bella is feeling today that whenever the woman is weighed and measured in this civilization, then the mass will be tightened and when the battle of the maidens like this will take place against this tightness, then the woman will be for men
 i will awaken a sense of hatred because they try to stay the boss by squeezing the woman's youth for their own benefit

 Public interest litigation has been filed in the Supreme Court in the CBSE paper leak case
 maamle ke mahatv or yachika par sangyaan lete hue nyaayalay sunwaayee ko taiyaar ho gaya he
 The petition will be heard today
 sibiai jaanch kii maangasibiesai paper li maamle main kerala ke rahane vaale ek chaatr ne supreme court main yachika daayar kii he
 In the petition, the student has said that the result should be declared on the basis of the examination that has been done and a CBI inquiry should be conducted to find out the real culprits
 saath hi jaanch ko court kii nigaraanee main karaaye jane kii maang kii gai he
 CBSE and HRD Ministry have been made defendants in this petition
 maamle kii jaanch ke bina naa ho dobaaraa parikshasath hi yachika main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki abhi maamle ki jaanch-padtaal krime branch kar rahi he
 The government has decided to repeat the examinations of Class 10 Mathematics and Economics of Class 11 without coming the report of the inquiry
 jo ki chaatro ke adhikaar ke khilaaf he
 Some culprits should not be punished by students across the country
 bina jaanch puri hue yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki sirf do hi paper li hue the yaa or zyada
 Therefore, it is wrong to re-examine mathematics and economics without getting any report of investigation
 sibiesai ko paper li kii thi jaankariyachika main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki shiksha mantralay aurasibiesaiko samay rahete paper li kaa pataa chal gaya tha fir bhi 12veen kaa arthshaastra kaa paper 26 march ko hua
 The paper leak of the 10th was also detected, yet it was not stopped
 phir maamla prakaash main aane ke baad 28 march ko jaanch ke liye krime branch ko saunpa gaya

 As part of a strategy to double the income of the country's farmers by 2022, the Ministry of Agriculture has started an exercise to explore all possible measures
 krishi kshetra main 25 lakh karod ke baari bharkam nivesh se tasviir badalane kii lakeer khinchi gai he or saath hi is disha main rajyavar ranneeti banane par bhi kaam shuru ho gaya he
 Modi government 2
 0 ke pehle bajet ke fouran baad kendriya krishi mantri narendra singh tomars ke netritv main somvaar ko bulaai gai rajyon ke krishi mantriyon kii baithak dilli main kii gai
 During this, Narendra Singh Tomar made a 10 point outline, seeking active cooperation of the states in the campaign to increase the income of farmers
 1
 PM Kisan Samman The Prime Minister Narendra Modi started the 'PM Kisan Samman Nidhi' scheme before the elections to improve the condition of farmers
 iske tahat kisaanon ko kheti ke liye salanaa 6 hajaar rupye ko teen kishton main diya ja rahaa he
 The farmers have got the first installment
 desh ke sabhi 14
 a target has been set to connect 5 crore farmer families with this scheme, but so far the government has been able to benefit only three and a half crore farmers
 aise main baaki bache kisaanon ko is yojana kaa laabh pahunchane kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya he
 2
 jaivik kheti or jiro bajet prakritik khetimodi sarkaar 2
 In the first budget of 0, the emphasis was on returning to traditional and basic methods through zero farming
 isiilie sammelan main sabase zyada focus isi par rahaa
 Farmers should do natural farming instead of fertilizers, pesticides in whatever crop farmers grow in zero budget farming
 isamen rasinic khaad ke sthaan par gobar, gomutra, chane ke besan, gud or mitti se bane khaad kaa istemaal kiya jaae
 There has been talk of providing various help to farmers towards zero budget farming
 3
 Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme Every year due to natural disaster, farmers in India suffer a lot of losses
 baadh, aandhi, ole or tej barish se unki fasal kharaab ho jaati he
 To give them relief from such crisis, the Central Government has launched the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme
 aise main desh ke sabhi kisaanon tak is yojana se jodne kaa lakshya rakhaa he, lekin rajyon ke krishi mantriyon ke sammelan main uttar pradesh ke krishi mantri suryapratap shahi ne pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana ko lekar sawaal khadey kiye
 He said that the way farmers should be benefited from this scheme is not being received
 4
 Market Reform: Modi government wants to improve the economic condition of farmers through agricultural market reform
 rajyon ke krishi mantriyon ke sammelan main kendriya mantri ne mandi sudhaar ke liye rajya sarkaron se sahyog kii maang kii, kyonki is kaam ko rajya rakaar hi anjaam de sakati he
 Modi government 2
 0 ne apane bajet main 10 hajaar nae krishi utpaadak sanghathan banane kii baat kahi he
 5
 kisaan credit card abhiyanmodi sarkaar kisaan credit card se desh bhar ke kisaanon ko jodne kii disha main jor diya he
 Emphasizing the dairy sector and fisheries along with farming, the government is including it under the purview of the Kisan Credit Card so that farmers do not have to be forced to lend themselves to moneylenders
 sarkaar kisaan credit card ke jariye 4 fisadi byaaj par teen lakh tak kaa lone detii he
 6
 rashtriya khaadya suraksha mishanrashtriya khaadya suraksha mishan ke tahat susthir aadhaar par gehun, chaaval or dalhan kii utpaadakta main vruddhi laana taaki desh main khaadya suraksha kii sthiti ko sunishchit kiya ja sake
 Initiatives have also been taken to establish clusters with digital literacy, self-reliance in pulses and oilseeds to two crore farmers
 7
 Contract Farming: Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar asked agriculture ministers from states to show interest in contract farming and state governments should take steps in this direction
 is dauraan krishi mantri ne contract kheti ke maamalon ko bhi protsaahan dene kii baat kahi, lekin rajyon ke krishi mantri apni ore se is disha main haath daalane se kataraa rahe hai
 Actually, in contract farming, the farmer cultivates his land, but not for himself but for a corporate or multinational company
 contract farming main kisaan ko paisa nahin kharch karnaa padataa
 8
 krishi aayaat-niryaat nitiyankendre sarkaar ne krishi par aayaat or niryaat main nitiyaan banane kii baat kahi he
 The government has spoken through this to export the crops of the farmers and make them economically prosperous, but the question is that even today the farmer sells his crop to the middlemen instead of selling it at the government selling center
 9
 Annadata-turned-energetic government has announced in the budget that plans will be launched to make the country's donor an energy provider
 is baat ko rajyon ke krishi mantriyon ke sammelan main bhi jor diya gaya he ki rajya sarkarein is disha main plan banaaen ki kisaanon ko kaise aatmanirbhar banaaya jaae or krishi sansadhano ke jariye ve urjadaata bane
 In this, they will get benefit from the solar pump where they produce their electricity as well as the electricity they produce
 krishi se sambadhit gramin udyog main 75 hajaar naye udhyami taiyaar karne kii yojana he

 digar baat yah bhi he ki isi maheene kii 12 taarikh ko sumitra mahajan umr ke 76 saal puure karne ja rahi hai
 In recent years, there has been a tradition in the BJP of not giving tickets to leaders above the age of 75
 sumitra mahajan ne bhashaa se kaha, "sabase pehali baat to yah he ki jab maine varsh 1989 main indore se apana pehla loksabhaa chunaav ladaa tha, tab bhi maine party se tikat nahin maanga tha, party ne mujhe khud tikat diya tha, maine apni party se aaj tak tikat nahin maanga he

 "unhone kaha, "maine bijepi sanghathan ke kisi bhi netaa se baat nahin kii he ki indore se party ke ummidavaar kii ghoshnaa kyon roki gai he? hamaari party main is tarah ke sawaal nahin kiye jate, kyonki ummidavaar tay karnaa hamaare sanghathan kaa kaam he
 In case of candidate selection from Indore, the BJP organization will take appropriate decision at the appropriate time
 "indore seat ke ummidavaar ke taur par unke vikalp ke rup main bhaajapa ke kuch sthaneey netaaon ke naam saamne aae hai, is bare main mahajan ne kaha, "yah acchhee baat he or swaabhaavik prakriya bhi he
 There should be lots of options in the party
 isi se party majboot maani jaati he or yah bhi pataa chalata he ki party main itane yogya kaaryakarta hai ki inamen se kisi ko bhi tikat de diya jaae, to vah chunaav jeet jayega
 "however, unimpressed by all the speculation, Samitra Tai has taken the electoral fray as a guide for local BJP workers
 ve loksabhaa chunaavon kii taiyaariyon ke maddenjar bhaajapa ke abhiyaan ke tahat shahar bhar main party kaaryakartaaon kii baithken le rahi hai

 The benefits of Pradosha fast are obtained according to different days
 - ravivaar ko padane vaale pradosh vrath se aayu vruddhi tathaa acha swasthya laabh praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 - a fast that is observed on the occasion of Trayodashi on Monday provides healing and all human desires are fulfilled

 aakhirkaar lambey intjaar ke baad france se 36 rafel ladaaku vimaanon kaa sauda shuukravaar ko ho jayega
 France's Defense Minister jean-louis Le Drian is coming to Delhi on 22 September i
e
 Thursday for this deal
 saude ko lekar shuruaati baatcheet 1999-2000 main hui thi
 In those days the Air Force was concerned about the dwindling fleet of fighters
 rafel saude par hastakshar hone ke 36 maheene ke bheetar yani 2019 main vimaan aana shuru jaaenge
 All 36 aircraft will arrive in India within 66 months
 tabhi se lekar rafel par lagaataar baatcheet chalati rahi or ab jaakar saude par hastakshar hone ja rahe hai
 Let us tell you that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced to buy 36 Rafale aircraft during his visit to France about one and a half years ago
 is dauraan donon deshon ne government tu government deal ke liye samjhauta bhi kiya tha
 Rafale makes fighter jets the Dassault Aviation Company of France
 36 vimaan sidhe france se aaenge
 Last year, when negotiations were started with Dassault, France, for the price of Rafale, it gave 36 Rafale worth 12 billion Euros
 iske baad janvari main dobaaraa baat hui to qeemat 8
 Reached at 6 billion euros
 april main antim daur kii baatcheet hui to vimaanon kii qeemat par 7
 87 billion euro stamped
 yah sauda 7
 87 billion euros
 yani agar bhartiya rupee main baat karen to kareeb 59 hajaar karod main aayega
 The cost of one Rafale, including the weapon, will be around 1600 crores
 vimaanon kii qeemat ko lekar france kii ore se janvari main bataai gai shuruaati raashi se maujuuda qeemat lagbhag 750 million euro kam he
 At this price, not only Rafale fighter aircraft will come but it will have better weapon system than one
 masalan mitior missile hongi
 Beyond visual range missile with a capacity of 150 km will also be there
 kargil jang ke dauraan bhartiya ladaaku vimaanon ke paas biond vijual range vaale missile to the lekin unki range 60 kilometre thi
 Later Pakistan also acquired a missile that has a range of 80 km
 yani miteor ke aane se hamaari vayusena ke missile pakistani vayusena ke missile par kaaphi baari padenge
 With the ship being air-to-air missile missiles, many areas of Tibet and Pakistan will come into India without crossing the border
 rafaal vimaan main bhartiya vayusena kii zaruuraton ke lihaaj se taqariban ek darjan pherbadal bhi kiye gaye hai
 Not only this, it will have air-to-ground scallop missiles
 iskaa nishaanaa achook he yani yahaan baithe baithe is ladaaku vimaan ke missile kisi bhi aatanki camp ko barabaad kar sakate hai
 The long-range air-to-ground scallop missile gives India a natural edge over its rivals
 dasalt vayusena ko muft main prashikshan bhi degi
 Not only this, France will guarantee an additional flight of 60 hours for training of pilots
 saath hi hathiyaaron ke storage ke liye 6 maheene kii atirikt guarantee degaa
 For example, if your arms depot is not ready, France can keep another six months in its own place, there will be no separate cost for this
 samjhaute kii sharton ke mutabik francisi company ko yah yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki bharat ke paas vimaanon kaa 75 pratishat bedaa har vaqt oparational rahe
 If we talk about Sukhoi planes, then this figure is 60 percent
 kharaab rakrakhaav ke kaaran sukhoi vimaanon ke liye teen saal pehle tak yahi aankada mahaz 48 pratishat tha
 The comments pehle paanch saal tak shuruaati keemat par hi vimaan ke saamaan milte lekin ab saat saalon tak aisa hoga
 If later, he can talk to France after seven years to further develop the government
 ladaaku vimaanon ke maamle main vayusena kii sthiti thik waisi hi he jaisi nayi topon ke maamle main thal sena kii
 India has not bought any cannon in the last 28 years
 zaahir he aise main rafel vimaanon kaa aana vayusena ke liye aitihaasik baat he
 Since then, talks have continued on Rafael and now the deal is going to be signed
 ham aapako yah bataa den ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne lagbhag dedh saal pehle apni france yatra ke dauraan 36 rafel vimaan kharidne kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 During this time, the two countries also entered into an agreement for the Government to Government deal
 rafel ladaaku vimaanon ko france kii dasalt aviation company banaati he
 36 planes will arrive directly from France
 jab pichley saal france ke dasalt se rafel ke keemat ko lekar baatcheet shuru kii gai tab usne 36 rafel kii keemat 12 billian euro bataai thi
 After this, talk again in January, then price 8
 6 billian euro par aakar tiki
 The final round of talks took place in April, then the price of the planes was 7
 87 billian euro par muhar lag gai
 This deal 7
 87 billian euro main hone ja rahaa he
 That is, if we talk in Indian rupees, then it will come to about 59 thousand crores
 ek rafel kii keemat hathiyaar ke sahit kareeb 1600 karod rupee kii padegi
 The current price of France is about 750 million euros less than the initial amount reported by France in January
 isi keemat main keval rafel ladaaku vimaan hi nahin aayega balki usamen ek se badhkar behatar hathiyaar pranali hogi
 For example, there will be mitior missiles
 biond vijual range missile jisaki kshamta 150 killimetre he, bhi hogi
 During the Kargil war, Indian fighter jets had Beyond Visual Range missiles but their range was 60 kilometers
 baad main pakistan ne bhi aisi missile hasil kar lee jisaki range 80 kilometre he
 That is, with the arrival of Meteor, our Air Force missiles will be very heavy on the Pakistani Air Force missile
 jahaaz main hawa se hawa main maar karne vaali miteor missile hone se tibet or pakistan ke kai ilaake bagaiyr sarhad paar kiye bharat kii zad main aa jaaenge
 In the Rafale aircraft, about a dozen changes have also been made to meet the needs of the Indian Air Force
 itnaa hi nahi isamen hawa se jameen main maar karne vaali scalp misile hongi
 Its target is infallible, meaning that the missiles of this fighter aircraft sitting here can destroy any terrorist camp
 lambii duuri kii hawa se zamin par maar karne vaali scalp missile kaa hona bharat ko apane pratidwadviyon par ek swaabhaavik badhat detaa he
 Dassault will also train the Air Force for free
 itnaa hi nahin, france payalton ke prashikshan ke liye 60 ghante kii atirikt udaan kii guarantee degaa
 It will also provide an additional 6 months guarantee for weapons storage
 masalan agar aapkaa hathiyaaron kaa depo taiyaar nahin ho paaya he to france apane yahaan chah maheene or rakh saktaa he, iske liye koi alag se keemat nahin deni hogi
 According to the terms of the agreement, the French company will have to ensure that 75 percent of the aircraft fleet remains operational with India at all times
 agar baat sukhoi vimaanon kii karen to yah aankada 60 fisadi he
 The same figure was just 48 percent for Sukhoi aircraft three years ago due to poor maintenance
 tippaniyan For the first five years, aircraft items were available at the initial price, but now this will be done for seven years
 agar baad main sarkaar main aage or badhaane ke liye france se saat saal baad baat kar sakati he
 In the case of fighter aircraft, the situation of the Air Force is the same as that of the Army in the case of new guns
 bharat ne pichley 28 saalon main koi top nahin kharidi he
 Apparently, the arrival of Rafale planes is a historical thing for the Air Force
 jab pichley saal france ke dasalt se rafel ke keemat ko lekar baatcheet shuru kii gai tab usne 36 rafel kii keemat 12 billian euro bataai thi
 After this, talk again in January, then price 8

 The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which is running the government in Delhi, promised to improve Yamuna's condition in the 2015 assembly elections as well
 party ke 70 point ection plan main yamuna ko 15waan sthaan diya gaya
 What work the Delhi government did after 4 years has passed, is in front of everyone
 ab phir se AAP ne loksabhaa chunaav ke liye jari kiye sankalp patr main yamuna kaa kayakalp karne kaa vaada kiya he
 In the manifesto of the Aam Aadmi Party it was also told what the Delhi Government has done till now and what it will do after the formation of a full state
 ab tak jo kiya- yamuna kii safai ke liye interceptor siver pariyojna kaa 92 pratishat kaam puraa kar liya gaya
 - About 110 MGD sewage water was prevented from flowing into the Yamuna, which was usable through STP
 - dilli jal board dwaara yamuna kayakalp yojana kii shuruyaat kii, jiske tahat yamuna main aane vaale gande pani, thos kachra or risaav se bachaav ke intjaam kiye jaaenge
 For this, a provision of Rs 75 crore has been made in the budget of 2019-20
 purna rajya hone ke baad ye karenge- kai sarkari agenciyon ke saath talmail, yamuna ko 10 saal ke bheetar tems (landan) or tseol kii tarj par saaf or svachh banaaya ja saktaa he

 On the cleanliness of the Yamuna, Aaj Tak asked the questions of the Lok Sabha candidates of the Aam Aadmi Party, through which the Yamuna passes most
 uttari-purvi dilli loksabhaa se aam aam aadmi party ke ummidavaar dilip pandeya ne daawa karte hue kaha "dilli jal board ne yamuna kii safai kaa 3 phej kaa ek plan banaaya he, jiskaa rigelt safal hoga
 We have been communicating with the central government, asking for help from them
 yamuna kii safai ke liye aam aadmi party kii sarkaar kaam kar rahi he
 "on further inquiring whether the quarrel between the Central and State Government is also becoming a hurdle in cleaning the Yamuna? In response, Dilip Pandey said that if the State Government is in tune with the Central Government, then the work is good
 isliye aam aadmi party kaa saansad hona zaruri he jo dilli sarkaar kii yojanaon ko centre sarkaar ke saamne majbootee se rakh sake
 However, Aam Aadmi Party candidate from East Delhi has told the raw colonies the reason for the mess in Yamuna
 'ajtak' ke sawaal par aatishi ne jawaab dete hue kaha ki "dilli kii yamuna main bina treet hua naale kaa pani jaataa he kyonki kareeb 75% dilli kachi coloniyon main rahati he or in kachi coloniyon main pani, siver or naaliyon kii vyavastha pichley 20 saal tak pichhali sarkaron se nahi hui
 Therefore it is expected that in 4 years 75% of the public will become sewage treatment plants, this is not possible
 in kachi coloniyon main jagah kii samasya sabase badi he
 The Aam Aadmi Party government has planned a mini sewage plant, which will make the cleaning of Yamuna possible
 "puure maamle main 'ajtak' ne nadiyon kii safai par lambey vakt se research karte aae vaigyanik faiyaaz khudasar se baatcheet kii
 Fayaz Khudsar, while taunting the promises of political parties in the manifesto, said that the general public asked for roads, flyovers, malls, metros, good hospitals
 lekin acchhee nadi kabhi kisi ne nahi maangi
 We overlooked the river because the demand for clean air or water is not kept firmly in front of the government, then how will it become a part of the manifesto
 unhone aage bataaya ki neshnal green tribunel(engiti) ne ek aadesh main yamuna, ganga, yamuna, kaali or krishni nadi ko saaf karne ke liye yamuna biodivarsity park ke model kaa udhaaharan diya tha
 Fayyaz Khudsar explains that there is a plan to give life to the river
 dilli main yamuna ko saaf karne ke liye ek aisa system banaaya jaae jisase naala sidhe nadi main na jaae
 Such a system can be designed along river banks
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki dilli main yamuna main rang badalati he
 In Palla, the Yamuna is mottled, the Yamuna becomes green in further vizirism, the Yamuna is stopped to extract drinking water in the plant here
 wazirabad ke aage yamuna 22 kilometre tak bahati he, jisamen ek boond pine kaa pani nahin hota he
 20 to 22 rivulets are found in the Yamuna, the first and the biggest is the drain of Najafgarh, which is the major reason for the destruction of the Yamuna
