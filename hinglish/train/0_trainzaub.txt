 The efforts of India's membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSSG) were severely pushed by China at the Seoul meeting
 padosi ke adiyal rukh ke kaaran hi hindustan enesji deshon main shaamil nahin ho sakaa, vahiin ab japan ne yah kahkar china ko bada jhatka diya he ki bharat kii sadsyta or enesji main maujuudagi se parmaanu aprasar ko badhaava main madad milegi
 This is the first time Japan has officially commented on this issue since the Sol meeting
 japani videsh mantralay ke sheersh adhikariyon ne angreji akhbaar 'times of india' se exclusive baatcheet main kaha, 'hamenesji main sadsytako sambhav banane ke liye bharat ke saath lagaataar kaam kar rahe hai
 "india's membership will be strengthened" Yasukira Kavamora, Director General of Press and Public Diplomacy at the Japanese Ministry of External Affairs said, "we want to continue working with India on this issue, because we feel that India's membership will give strength to the nuclear non-proliferation system
" 
 japan enesji ke duusare sadsy deshon ke saath is mudde par lagaataar baatcheet karata rahegaa
 Kavamora further said that everyone is aware of the Chinese attitude towards stopping India's membership
 japan is mudde parenesgike andar hui baatcheet par koi tippanee nahin karnaa chahta
 He said, 'the main issue is to ensure consensus and we are working on it
 ' bataa den ki coumora kuch saal pehle dilli main japan ke dipti chif of mishan ke rup main bhi kaam kar chuke hai
 Another top official of the Ministry of External Affairs and Senior Regional Coordinator in the Southwest Asia Division, Masayuki Taiga, requested the signing of the NPT, saying that India's membership would help Japan in promoting nuclear non-proliferation
 bharat kii daavedaari kaa samarthan karte hue bhi japan parmaanu aprasar sandhi (enpiti) ko lekar apni patibaddhta par kaayam he
 Kavamora said that Japan will continue to ask India to sign the deal in the normal spirit
 haalanki, tokyo ne enesji main entry ke liye bharat kii madad kii raah main uske enpiti par dastakhat nahin karne vaale raashtra ke darje ko baadhak nahin banane diya
 Just before the Vidhan Sabha elections in Karnataka, the Chief Minister of the state, Siddaramaiah has made a big bet for Kannada identity
 siddharmaiya ne rajya ke alag jhande ko manjuuri de di he
 The Karnataka government will now send it to the central government
 centre se manjuuri milte hi karnataka kaa yah aadhikarik rup se rajkeey jhanda ban jayega
 Just before the elections in the state, this decision of the Siddaramaiah government is considered to be in favor of the Congress on the pretext of the flag
 kaisaa he jhande kaa dizinkarnataka ke mukhyamantri siddharmaiya ne aaj is dhvaj kaa anaavaran kiya
 This rectangle has red, white and yellow stripes
 is dhvaj ko ‘naad dhvaj’ naam diya gaya he
 In the middle of this flag, a two-headed mythological bird named 'gandha Bherunda' is placed in the middle of this flag
 is jhande kaa dizin 1960 ke dashak main veeraa senaanee em e ramaamurti ne taiyaar kiya tha
 At present, only Jammu and Kashmir has its own flag, yet under Article 370 of the Constitution, Jammu and Kashmir has the special status that it has its own flag
 iske alaava kisi or rajya ke paas apana alag jhanda nahin he
 If the flag of Karnataka is approved by the Center, then Karnataka with a separate state will become the second state in the country
 alag jhande par kya he centre sarkaar kaa rukhkendre sarkaar kai maukon par spasht kar chuki he ki desh kaa dhvaj sirf tirangaa hi he
 In such a situation, there is currently doubt on the approval of the flag of Karnataka from the center
 grih mantralay ne bhi isse pehle saaf kar diya he ki aisa koi kanoonee praavdhaan nahin he jisamen rajyon ke liye alag jhande kii baat kahi gai ho yaa phir alag dhvaj ko pratibandhit karata ho
 BJP has been holding separate flags against 'unity and integrity of the country'
 jhande ke liye pichley saal bani thi samitikarnataka sarkaar ne pichley saal july main pradesh ke liye alag jhande kii maang karte hue ek nau sadasyeey samiti kaa gathan kiya tha
 Earlier in 2012, such a demand arose in the state, but the then BJP government strongly opposed it, saying that the move was against the 'unity and integrity of the country'
 2012 main bhi uthaa tha alag jhande kaa muddakarnataka vidhansabha main 2012 main ye mudda uthaaya gaya tha to us samay ke samskruti mantri govind em karjol ne flag code kaa zikr karte hue kaha tha ki flag code kisi bhi rajya main alag dhvaj kii ijaajat nahin detaa
 Our national flag is a symbol of unity, integrity and sovereignty of the country
 yadi rajya kaa alag jhanda hoga to yah hamaare rashtriya dhvaj kaa mahatv bhi kam karegaa, aisa hone par logon main praantvaad kii bhaavana ko bhi badhaava milegaa
 What is the Flag Code: The Flag Code of India is a set of laws, practices and conventions applicable to the display of the national flag
 flag code of india, 2002, ko teen bhaagon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Part one of the code contains a general description of the national flag
 doosraa bhaag saarvajanik, nijee sanghathanon, shaikshanik sansthaanon ke sadasyon dwaara rashtriya dhvaj ke pradarshan ko samarpit he jabaki tisare bhaag main kendriya or rajya sarkaron or unke sanghathanon or agenciyon dwaara rashtriya dhvaj pradarshit karne ke niyam-anushaasan hai

 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki jiyabaao ke saath sabhi muddon par saamaanya tareeke se charchaa hui
 He said that he agreed with the Chinese Prime Minister that there is a lot of potential for both countries to develop and grow in the world and both countries should cooperate among themselves
 unhone japan, malaysia or vietnam kii apni saat divasiy yatra samaapt karne ke baad swadesh lautne ke dauraan apane vishesh vimaan main samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main kaha ki hamane is baat ko phir se doharaaya ki hamen seemaa vivaad kaa vyaavhaarik or paraspar santoshjanak hal nikaalnaa chahie
 He said this when asked about the conversation with Jiabao
 donon pakshon main seemaa vivaad kii jatilta ko maanate hue yah sweekaar kiya ki iske hal tak seemaa par shanti banaayi rakhni chahie
 The two leaders directed their special representatives India's National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon and China's top official Dai Bingguo to find a way to resolve difficult issues in the relationship between the two countries

 RJD leader and former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav has asked Chief Minister Nitish Kumar questions regarding the Rafale fighter plane deal
 tejasvi ne kaha he ki agar nitish kumaar eemaandaar hai or unhen lagata he ki unki raajnneeti ke praneta pradhanmantri narendra modi ne rafel vimaan saude main imaanadaaree barti he to kya bharat sarkaar ko vimaan kii keemat desh ko nahin bataani chahie?tejasvi ne kaha ki agar bharat sarkaar rafel fiter vimaan saude kii jaankaree desh kii janata ko nahin detii he or yah nahin bataati he ki ek vimaan ko kitne main kharida gaya he to logon ko yah lagegaa ki is puure saude main ghotaalaa hua he
 Tejashwi said that Nitish Kumar, a representative of honesty, is silent on this deal and if he does not break his silence then people will see scam in this deal

 At the same time, Nitish has also been attacked by bjp's national president Amit Shah's son Jai Shah and former Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa
 tejasvi ne nitish se poocha he ki unhone ab tak apane nae-navele adarsh jai shah, mukul roy, sukhram sharma or bies yediurppa se kya-kya siikhaa he? nitish par tanj kasate hue tejasvi ne kaha he ki kya inhen bhaajapa ke netaaon se prerana lekar unhone bihar main agle maheene hone vaale upachunaav nahin ladane kaa faisla kiya he?udhar, somvaar ko mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne patrakaron se baatcheet karte hue jab is baat ko kabool kiya ki jis vakt mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar bani thi usee vakt hone lag gaya tha ki yah sarkaar ek yaa dedh saal se zyada nahin chalegi
 Regarding this, Tejaswi has said that he knew that there was already poison in his palate uncle's mind
 tejasvi ne kaha ki vah jaanate the ki vah to ek bahaanaa he or nitish ko bhaajapa ke saath janaa he
 RJD Netane said that Nitish Kumar should be ashamed that he used the 28-year-old youth as an excuse to hide the misdeeds of his chair

 If there is no merger, we will stop the BJP: Before this, the RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav had said that the merger should not happen but the biggest motive is to stop the BJP through alliance
 bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke purv janata parivaar ke vilay main takneekee dikkat hone ke samaajawaadee party netaa ramgopal yadav ke bayaan kii ore ishaara karte hue lalu ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki iskaa samaadhaan nanikaalane kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 Along with this, he said that he will contest the Bihar Assembly elections to be held later this year, by forming an alliance to keep the BJP away from power
 lalu ne kaha ki humlog janata parivaar ke vilay ke prabal samarthak hai
 To keep the BJP away from power, our party has supported Nitish Kumar in the past and then the Jeetan Manjhi government and also the Nitish government in the present

 The Ministry of Labor and Employment has launched a scheme for rating itis to promote excellence in vocational training
 maujuuda samay main desh bhar main takreeban 12,000 itiai hai
 The number of itis has doubled in the last five-six years
 agle paanch varshon ke bheetar kai or itiai kholane kaa prastaav he
 In view of such a high rate of development, it was considered necessary for these institutions to introduce a rating system
 reating yojana se vibhinn sansthaanon ke saath-saath vahaan peshkash kiye jane vaale paathyakramon (trade) kii aapas main tulana karne ke liye ek maanak kaayam karnaa sambhav ho gaya he
 This scheme will also make it easier to differentiate these institutions, which will increase the competition in the market
 aise main un sansthaanon main gunvattta behatar hone kii ummid bad gai he jo is maamle main pichad gaye hai
 Improving quality is definitely necessary to remain competitive
 reating kiye jane se students ke saath-saath recruiters ko bhi sahuuliyat hogi
 Under the normative fee structure associated with private itis, it is permissible to charge an additional 20 per cent in those itis which are rated five or four stars
 itiai main muhaiyaa karaaye jane vaale vyavsaayik prashikshan main gunvattta sunishchit karne ke liye paanch saal baad itiai kaa anivaary rup se pun: sambaddhikaran karaane kaa nirnay bhi rashtriya vyavsaayik prashikshan parishad (ensiviti) dwaara liya gaya he
 NCVT may also not give certificates to the students enrolled in itis from the session of August 2015, who were affiliated prior to the year 2009 and who have not applied for re-affiliation with NCVT till July 2015
 reating pranali ek aise prabandhan saadhan ke taur par bhi kaam karegi jisase samasyaon kii pahchaan karne or samuchit nitigat kadam uthaane main madad milegi
 These things are necessary for this
 
 1) It is voluntary for itis affiliated in NCVT
 2)kisi bhi santhaan kii reating do varsh tak maanya rahegi
 3) There will be no regulation on the fees associated with the rating process
 haalanki, reating agenciyon ko kisi khaas santhaan se vasule jane vaale shulk kaa khulaasa karnaa padegaa

 athlete milkha singh kii jindagi par bani rakesh omprakash mehara kii film bhaag milkha bhaag kamai ke maamle main bhi tej daud laga rahi he
 Adorned by Farhan Akhtar's brilliant acting and Prasoon Joshi's strong script and songs, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag has done business of over 30 crores in the first three days
 ummid jataai ja rahi he ki yah film 100 karod se bhi zyada kii kamai karegi
 Know how is Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, read the film's review According to trade analyst Taran Adarsh, the business of the film caught on from Friday night
 film ne ravivaar tak 32
 25 crore has been earned through cinemas in India
 bhaag milkha bhaag kaa kuch shaharon main guuruuvaar ko special privyuu kiya gaya tha
 This makes the film 1
 05 karod kii kamai hui
 The film debuted 8 on Friday
 5 karod kamaaye
 On Saturday, this figure increased to 10
 70 karod ho gaya
 It is estimated that the film grossed around Rs 12 crore on Sunday
 bhaag milkha bhaag film ke sho baaki filmon ke mukaable kuch kam hai
 The reason for this is the length of the film
 critics se shandaar rivyuu or stars paane vaali yah film 3 ghante 7 minute lambii he
 But it is expected that on the basis of Mouth Publicity, the film will continue to dominate the box office next week
 aapako ''63 nayanmaron (tamil shaiva santon) kii tarah 63 siten di gai hai
 You should accept these seats with the same devotion as Bhakti Nayanmars did
 '' congress ke saath siton ke liye saudebaaji ke teen dinon kaa khel khatm hone ke baad karunanidhi ne yah ghoshnaa kii thi
 The mention of religion by the head of the hardcore atheist DMK gives a sense of his insecurity
 yah pehali baar nahin he, jab karunanidhi ne apane kisi sahyogi ke saath dhamkee or blackmel kii raajnneeti kii he
 He has done this with the UPA earlier also and has shown this attitude to the NDA before that
 unhen molbhav main hameshaa hi safal hone kii kala aati rahi he, lekin aisa lagata he ki is baar ve congress ke saath ladaai haar chuke hai, dikhaava chaahe kuch bhi ho
 DMK and Kalaignar have to pay a heavy price for the 2G scam
 dramuk ke vayovruddh mukhiya ko purv telecom mantri e
 Now more than the king, the worry of this scam falling on his family is worrying
 dilli ke satta galiyaaron main charchaa aam he ki 2ji ghotaale kii jaanch ke teji se badhate daayre main ab sibiai karunanidhi kii beti or rajyasabha saansad kanimoli or unki patni rajati se poochtacha kar sakati he
 Kanimozhi or Rajati's direct involvement in this scam would be disastrous for the party as well as for Karunanidhi personally
 sibiai supreme court main 15 march ko ek states report or 31 march ko aaropapatr pesh karegi
 Sources present during the conversation between the Congress and Karunanidhi reveal that after threatening the UPA government to recall its ministers, Karunanidhi bowed to the Congress's demand for 63 seats on the same assurance that his 2G scam investigation The family will not be disturbed
 lekin mushkil samay main congress se mila yah aashwaasan bhi kaaphi nahin he
 Stepping back from her party's traditions, Tamil Nadu's first family is seeking God's help and advice from astrologers to win the assembly elections, while the 2G scandal has tarnished the party's image in the state
 1960 main ek sheersh patakatha lekhak ke taur par karunanidhi ne ek ke baad ek film main ugr samvaad likhe the, jinke jariye tark or vivek kaa majboot sandesh darshakon main gaya tha
 He also sharply questioned many superstitions
 yah us dravid andolan ke anuroop tha, jisaki neenv hi vivekshiltaa kii vichaardhaara par bani thi
 Whereas according to some today, the same head of the DMK wears yellow shawls on the advice of an astrologer
 jyotishiyon ke paas salaah ke liye sirf karunanidhi hi nahin daud rahe
 Second family of DMK leader (wife Dayalu and son M
 ke
 Stalin) and the third family (wife Rajati and daughter Kanimozhi) have consulted astrologers
 unke ek paariwarik jyotishi kii bhavishyavaanee sankat main fanse is parivaar ke liye shaayad hi koi raahat lekar ai ho
 a family astrologer told India Today on condition of anonymity, "I had predicted this DMK downfall many years ago
 grahon kii sthiti dekhte hue maine unhen kuch prasiddh mandiron main khaas puja karne kii salaah di thi, taaki grahon kaa asar kuch kam ho
 He says that although Karunanidhi's planets are good now, his son Stalin and daughter Kanimozhi's planets do not show signs of victory
 haal hi main rajati ne puure rajya kii dharmik yatra shuru kii he
 a week ago he worshiped at the famous Nellayappar temple in Tirunelveli
 rajya ke iti mantri pungotai alaadi aruna ke saath us mandir main jaakar unhone shri gandhimati devi or bhagwaan nelgayppar (shiv) ke saamne prarthana kii
 She stayed there for 50 minutes and during that time the priests there offered Archana and special lamp
 apni is yatra ke dauraan ve thirunelaveli ke najadik nav tirupati (nau pavitra vaishnav) mandir main bhi gayi
 Karunanidhi has been following other superstitions since last year
 2010 main vishaal thanjavur mandir ke sahasrabdi samaaroh main unhone bhaag liya tha, haalanki rajnatik vivaad se bachane ke liye tab unhone mandir ke mukhya dwaar kaa istemaal nahin kiya tha
 Indira Gandhi was said to have lost power on entering through the main gate of this temple, while M
 ji
 Ramachandran had a heart attack
 isi ke baad se is mandir main aane ke liye netaa log bagal ke daravaaje kaa istemaal karte hai
 Recent events reveal the growing religious faith among Karunanidhi's descendants
 2009 main loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan dramuk mukhiya ke bete or madurai se saansad em
 K
 algiri ne apane chunaav abhiyaan kii shuruyaat ek prasiddh mandir se kii thi or tab us mandir kii ore se unhen sammanit bhi kiya gaya tha
 Kanimozhi visited the famous Vaishnava temple Srirangam only a few months ago
 2010 main jab ve apni maa rajati ke saath thanjavur ke punnainnallur mariyammam mandir ke sahasrabdi samaaroh main gai thim, tab unhone vahaan poojoorchana bhi kii thi
 Karunanidhi's successor and the state's Deputy Chief Minister Stalin visited Sathya Sai Baba and took his blessings
 rajati ne to unke paanv bhi chhue
 Kalaignar visited Mata Amritanandamayi and Jaggi Vasudev of Isha Foundation recently
 jab karunanidhi se dharmik or aadhyatmik netaaon se melmilaap kii vajah poochi gai, to unka jawaab tha ki un dharmik netaaon se talmail rakhana katai galat nahin he, jo logon ke kalyaan ke liye kaam karte hai
 The metaphors of Hindu mythological narratives are playing an important role in the DMK election campaign - there are many instances when Karunanidhi and Stalin are shown as Lord Krishna and Arjuna respectively in the party's election posters, drawing inspiration from the Bhagavad Gita
 pehle bhi apni sarkaar ke kaaryakramon ko prachaarit karne ke liye dramuk ne dharmik rupakon kaa prayog kiya tha
 In October 2009, the newspapers advertised the introduction of a multi-purpose medical insurance scheme of the government, in which the god of death 'yama' was seen throwing a rope towards an old man lying on the death bed while sitting on the back of a strong bull

 darasal yah congress hi he, jisane raajnneeti kii lambii pari khilne vaale 86 varshiya karunanidhi kii aakhri nautanki ko nishphal kar diya he
 After the revelations of corruption his party and A
 raja kaa bachaav karne ke maamle main mushkil main fanse dramuk ke mukhiya ko ab yah ummid kerani chahie ki unki ati naatakeeyata party ke manobal ko har str par ooncha uthaane main madad karegi
 Karunanidhi's deal with the Congress may have sent a message to the party workers that it is the DMK, which has the power to move the Congress, so the dmk's stand in seat sharing has been decisive
 2ji ghotaale kii jaanch ke maamle main congress kii taraf se karunanidhi ko mila aashwaasan zyada myne nahin rakhata, kyonki is jaanch main sibiai sidhe supreme court ko report kar rahi he
 But the DMK chief has limited options
 jayalalita ke haathon unki haar ke asaar hai
 After being accused in the 2G scam, his opponents will take steps against his family
 isi ke saath centre main bhi satta khone kaa matlab or zyada tut hona hoga
 This is the scenario where it is also difficult for God to save Karunanidhi, his wives, sons and daughter
 chah dashakon kii raajnneeti ke baad karunanidhi ko yah kadavi hakeekat tab samaj main ai hogi, jab unhone 8 march ko 63 siton kii congress kii 'ataarkik' maang ko sweekaar kiya hoga

 Has the ongoing talk about an alliance between the Samajwadi Party and the Congress broken or is the SP under Akhilesh Yadav using a strategy of coercion against its potential ally? This question is arising because of the 191 candidates whose names were released in the first list today, Akhilesh Yadav has also been declared candidates on the seats on which the Congress had won the last time and was included in the demand list of the Congress
 
 haalanki sapa ke upaadhyaksh kiranmay nanda kaa kahana he ki ham congress ko 84-89 siten de sakate hai
 Second list of 18 candidates released; On Friday evening, SP also released the second list of 18 candidates
 jisamen varisht netaa benny prasad verma ke bete rakesh verma ko baharich ke kaisarganj se tikat diya gaya he
 In this list, Pawan Pandey, who was a supporter of Akhilesh during the discord in SP, has been fielded in Ayodhya seat of Faizabad
 pawan pandey par hi ashu malik se hathapayee karne kaa aarope laga tha
 He was then sacked by Shivpal Yadav from the party, although he remained a minister in the Akhilesh cabinet
 shivpal ke bete ko tikat nahinfaijabad se hi gosiganj seat se abhaya singh or bikapur seat se anand sen ko ummidavaar ghoshit kiya gaya he
 In this list so far, Beni Prasad Verma, Naresh Aggarwal and Azam Khan's sons have been given tickets
 haalanki shivpal yadav ke bete aditya yadav ko ab tak kisi seat par tikat nahin mila he
 The preference for Muslim candidates has been given to the sons of Bibi Prasad Verma, Naresh Aggarwal and Azam Khan
 sapa dwaara jari 18 ummidavaaron kii duusari list main chah muslim or do dalit ummidavaaron ke naam ghoshit kiye gaye hai
 So far, Samajwadi Party has announced its candidates for 209 seats, including the first and second list
 inamen 56 muslim, 41 dalit or 22 yadav ummidavaar hai
 In this way, 26 in sp's declared list so far
 5 fisadi musalmaan, 19
 6 per cent Dalit and 10
 52 fisadi yadav ummidavaar hai
 SP has declared candidates on Mathura, Khurja, Hapur, Shamli, Sayana, swar-tanda in Akhilesh Yadav's list
 mathura se congress ke sielpi pradeep maathur 4 baar se vidhayak hai, vahiin khurja se banshi pahadiya, hapur se gajraj singh or shamali se pankaj malik congress ke vidhayak hai
 Congress MLA from Saina Dilnavaz Khan has recently left the party and joined the BSP
 congress ye seat sapa ko dene ko raji thi, lekin uske badale main duusari seat maang rahi thi
 Azam Khan's son got a SP ticket from the sitting seat of Congress, while Nawab Kazim Ali won on the Congress ticket from this seat, which recently went to the BSP
 congress rampur jile kii is seat ko chhodane ko taiyaar thi, lekin uske badale main chamaroua seat chaahati thi
 The SP has announced candidates for both the seats
 noida, gajiabad kii siten bhi akhilesh yadav ne nahin chhodin, jabaki yahaan kii shahari siten congress maang rahi thi
 At the same time, Congress has been given a jolt by declaring seats in Meerut because, here too, the Congress was eyeing the urban seat
 yahi vajah he ki list ke saarvajanik hote hi congress-sapa gathbandhan par sawaal uthne lage hai
 It is believed that either the alliance has broken or Akhilesh wants to convince the Congress to take his word under pressure
 shivpal yadav ko jaswant nagar itawa se tikat diya gaya he
 According to sources, he is still not keen on contesting but Mulayam has spoken to him
 shivpal yadav ke bete ko tikat nahin mila he jabaki ajam khan or naresh agarwal ke bete list main hai
 Azam Khan's son Abdullah Azam has a ticket from Ramnagar, Swar while Nitin is from Hardoi

 BJP president Amit Shah has called a meeting of chief ministers of bjp-ruled states on August 27 and organizational core groups of all states on August 23
 in baithkon main sarkaar or party ke bich behatar samanvay, ‘‘garib-samarthak’’ pahalon ko badhaava die jane or digital media kaa istemaal badhaane jaise muddon par charchaa ho sakati he
 The decision by Shah to hold one-to-one meetings came against the backdrop of the passage of the GST Bill in the Rajya Sabha
 is vidheyak ke agle saptaah loksabhaa main paarit hone kii ummid he
 However, party sources insisted that the reason for these meetings is not the GST Bill as it is a matter between the Center and the states
 shah ke agenda main santhnik maamle sheersh par rahenge
 Sources said that the main issues on the agenda include better coordination between the government and the party, promoting the Modi government's "pro-poor and vulnerable sections" initiatives and digital media to promote the party and the government's agenda Includes increasing use of
 sutron ne kaha ki jiesti ke kriyanvayan kaa mudda charchaaon main shaamil ho saktaa he kyonki shah kaa maananaa he ki sansad main iskaa paarit ho janaa ek mahatvapurn uplabdhi hogi or party shasit rajyon kii sarkaron ko ise safal banane ke liye apni ore se sarvshereshth prayaas karnaa chahie
 The party president will also review the implementation of the decisions taken at the party's national executive meeting in Allahabad
 jin rajyon main party paaramparik rup se kamjor he, unamem party ke aadhaar ko vistaar dene ke liye sanghathan kii ore se kiye ja rahe prayaason kaa vah jayja lenge

 ) shah kii ore se ek ke baad ek baithken karne kaa yah faisla rajyasabha main jiesti vidheyak paarit ho jane kii prishthbhumi main aayaa he
 The bill is expected to be passed in the Lok Sabha next week
 haalanki party ke sutron ne is baat par jor diya ki in baithkon kii vajah jiesti vidheyak nahin he kyonki yah centre or rajyon ke bich kaa maamla he
 Organizational matters will remain at the top of Shah's agenda
 sutron ne kaha ki agenda main mukhya muddon main sarkaar or party ke bich behatar samanvay karnaa, modi sarkaar kii ‘‘garib-samarthit or kamjor tabakon kii pakshdhar’’ pahalon ko badhaava dena or party evam sarkaar ke agenda ko badhaava dene ke liye digital media kaa istemaal badhanaa shaamil he
 Sources said that the issue of implementation of GST could figure in the discussions as Shah believes that its passage in Parliament will be a significant achievement and the governments of the party ruled states should do their best to make it successful
 
 party adhyaksh elahabaad main party kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main liye gaye faislon ke kriyanvayan kii bhi samiksha karenge
 In states where the party is traditionally weak, it will take stock of the efforts being made by the organization to expand the party's base

 Apart from this, departments have also been asked to identify disabled people

 In this episode, tribals were massacred in Sonbhadra in Uttar Pradesh
 is mudde par yogi sarkaar kii aankh tab khuli jab vahaan congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi pahunchi
 When Priyanka wanted to meet the victim's family, the government did not let her go there for fear of opening her secret
 naanaa patole ne kaha ki nishchit rup se sonbhadra sahit bijepi shasit rajyon main ho rahe adivaasiyon par julm ke mudde ko ve uthaaenge
 For this, we have started planning

 In such a situation, we will make people aware of the anti-tribal policies of the BJP
 iske liye congressi kaaryakarta adivaasiyon ke paas ghar-ghar tak jaaenge
 Explain that out of total 81 assembly seats in Jharkhand, 28 seats are reserved for the Scheduled Tribes

 Of these, 15 seats were won by bjp-shiv Sena
 jabaki 10 siten congress-ensipi ko mili thi
 Through the massacre at Sonbhadra, the Jharkhand Congress is engaged in an exercise to reintegrate tribal voters
 jharkhand ke ek congress netaa ne naam na chhapane kii shart par bataaya ki iske liye bade adivasee netaaon ko bhi kaarykram ke dauraan jutaney kii taiyaari he
 Apart from Sonbhadra, the focus is on the Land Acquisition Amendment Act, the demand to implement the Sarna Code, the implementation of the provisions of the Fifth Schedule, the demand for enforcement of occupation law, and the solidarity of the tribals to serve the tribal community
 jilon main karyrat adivasee sanghathanon ko jodne main bhi party ke netaa-kaaryakarta apni takat lagaayenge
 Please tell that a massacre took place on Wednesday in Umbha village of Ghoraval in Sonbhadra for taking possession of land
 is ghatana main 10 logon kii hatya kar di gai or 28 log ghayal ho gaye
 Priyanka Gandhi took the initiative immediately regarding this incident, due to which the BJP government of the state came on the backfoot

 'big bos' se baahar aakar aise hai swami om ke rang
 
 
 However, when Vikrant was called on the show, a lot of misunderstandings were cleared up and Vikrant had decided that they would get married as soon as Mona Kebig came out of Bosske's house

 lekin IS ke atyaacharon ko jhelane vaali yajidi mahila nadia muraad ne apni kitaab ke jariye IS ke maanviyata ko sharmasaar kar dene vaale karnaamon kaa khulaasa kar diya he
 Nadia Murad, a resident of the Kocho village of Sinjar, bordering Syria in Nineveh province of northern Iraq and from the Yazidi minority community, was taken hostage by the Sunni fundamentalist IS in 2014, three years ago
 us samay muraad kii umr 21 varsh thi
 IS militants used to act as sex slaves with Murad, meaning IS fighters used to pacify their lust
 muraad kisi tarah IS ke kabje se bhaagane main safal raheen or ab vah germany main rahati hai
 Murad's book was released last week, in which he made a painful statement about his being in possession of the IS
 muraad ne apni pustak'da last girl: maai story of captivity and maai fite against da islamic state' main apane saath hui barbarta kaa dil dahala dene vaala varnan kiya he
 Gangrepamurad used to be caught on the run, in his book, that he tried to escape from the clutches of the IS several times and was caught several times
 jab bhi vah bhaagate hue pakad lee jaatin, unke saath samuhik balatkaar kiya jaataa
 He wrote, "once i tried to run away wearing a dress worn by Muslim women, but a guard caught me
 usne mujhe maaraa or chah ladaakon kii apni centry ko saunp diya
 They all raped me until i lost consciousness
 "vah aage likhti hai ki agle saptaah unhen chah ladaakon kii ek anya centry ko saunp diya gaya
 They were also continuously raped and beaten up by those fighters
 iske baad ek IS ladaake ko unhen saunp diya gaya, jo unhen lekar syria chalaa gaya
 In the place of helping people, handing back to the IS, Murad says that he once got a chance to escape in Mosul
 vah bagiche kii chaharadivari phandane main safal raheen
 But while wandering the streets of Mosul, he did not understand what to do, he rang the doorbell of an unknown house and pleaded for help
 haalanki aisa nahin he ki unhen har baar anjaan logon se madad mili ho
 He had told his niece, who was living a life of sex slaves in the possession of the IS, that he had been solicited for help by unknown people six times
 lekin unhone muraad kowapas IS ke havalekar diya
 In Mosul, however, her courageous move came to fruition and she somehow managed to reach the refugee camp
 IS ne yajidiyon par dhaae julmmuraad bataati hai ki iraq or syria main unhone dekha ki sunni muslim aam jivan jite rahe, jabaki yajidiyon ko IS ke saare julm sitam sahane pade
 Murad says that the murders of our people continued to be raped, and Sunni Muslims kept watching all of them
 unhone kuch nahin kiya
 It is noteworthy that Yazidi is a minority community in Iraq and Syria and is a victim of atrocities of Muslims
 2014 main IS ne 7,000yajidi ladakiyon or mahilaon ko bandhak bana liya tha, jisamen nadia muraad bhi shaamil thim
 Yazidi men and old women were killed by IS fighters
 muraad ke aath bhai or unki maa kii bhi hatya kar di gai thi
 IS young men and women were taken hostage for sex
 muraad apni pustak main likhti hai, "apni kahani kahana kabhi aasaan nahin hota
 Every time you say about it, you are living it again like a manger
 kai baar aisa hota tha ki aapke saath lagaataar sirf balaatkaar hota rahata tha
 You did not know who would open the door next and raped you
 har aane vaala din or khaufnakhota tha

 twitter
 com / varxubbixa — Ajay Maken (@ajaymaken) May 2, 2019 In this video, Amit Shah is heard saying that both our MP candidates Meenakshi Lekhi and Ramesh Bidhuri should not vote for a single job
 kareeb 18 second ke is video main amit shah yah bhi kehete hai ki bijepi kaa adhyaksh ho kar kahata hum ki mere donon pratyaashiyon ko vot mat dena
 Ajay Makanen has written with surprise that the BJP president himself is saying that if someone does not vote for Meenakshi Lekhi then why would anyone do it
 twit main hi maakan ne yah bhi spasht kiya ki unhen yah video@kundra_vishalne bheja tha
 Maken's video has also been liked by Delhi Congress
 minakshi lekhi nai dilli seat se bijepi kii ummidavaar hai or is seat par unka muqabla ajay maakan se hi he
 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found in the investigation that the video going viral is misleading
 yah video adhuraa he jisaki vajah se amit shah kii baat ke arth kaa anarth ho gaya he
 The archived version of Maken's tweet can be viewed
 fasebukapar bhi log yah video share kar rahe hai
 In the video, Amit Shah is saying: 'but these two mps of ours are candidates, sister is Lekhi and Ramesh Bidhuri, do not vote for both of them for a single job, i say you are the President of BJP, i say Vote for both candidates for a single task
 ’AFWA ne paaya ki viral ho rahaa video amit shah kii 1 may ko dilli ke vasant kunj main hui raily kaa ansh he

 In this video, at 1:20:06, Shah can be heard saying: 'friends, the Narendra Modi government did a lot of work, did a lot of work for the poor, provided houses, provided electricity, provided toilets, provided gas connections
 , Gave pure drinking water, gave many things for Delhi too
 magar hamaare ye donon saansad pratyaashee hai bahan lekhi he or ramesh bidhudi he, ye ek bhi kaam ke liye donon ko vot mat dena, main kahata hum aapako, bijepi kaa adhyaksh ho kar kahata hum mere donon pratyaashee ko ye ek bhi kaam ke liye vot mat dena
 One lakh crore rupees has been spent by Delhi for Delhi, they do not have to vote for them, they do not have to vote, they must vote for them, Modi ji has secured the country, so voting, has secured the country
 ’boomlivene bhi is viral video kaa sach saamne rakhaa he
 Watch the video of the speech here - it is clear that Amit Shah has not refused to vote for the BJP candidates

 Is the Kejriwal government making false claims in its advertisements? Is the Kejriwal government wasting Delhi's money in misleading advertisements? These questions are arising because the Delhi BJP held a press conference on Monday and accused the Kejriwal government of lying in advertisements
 somvaar ko dilli bijepi mukhyalay main dilli bijepi ke mahaamantri kulajit singh chahal or rajesh bhaatia ke saath-saath upaadhyaksh rajeev babbar ne dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal or congress ke pradesh adhyaksh ajay maakan se dilli kii janata ko gumraah karnaa chhod uttam evam behatar dilli ke vikaas ke liye kaam karne ko kaha
 Kuljit Singh Chahal said in Delhi Press Conference as soon as MCD election came, that CM Kejriwal, who was missing for almost 2 years as soon as MCD election is near, is suddenly worried about Delhi and Delhi government is issuing misleading advertisement on the pretext of its second anniversary
 
 jisamen dilli sarkaar dwaara janalokapal ko paas kar dena, sikh danga peediton ko 5 lakh muaavja dene jaise jhuthe daawey kiye ja rahe hai
 Manoj Tiwari spent nights in slums and illegal colonies, Rajesh Bhatia said that Kejriwal was a major promise of the government and nowadays he is claiming to provide complete and clean water to Delhi in his advertisements
 jabaki ye sab dilli bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari ke reality check karne ke baad hua
 Bhatia said that Manoj Tiwari spent nights in slums and illegal colonies
 jis dauraan sthaneey logon ne unhen sardi main bhi pani kii killat se avgat karaayaa tha
 Kejriwal played with the sentiments of the Sikhs, Deputy Chairman Rajiv Babbar made a big charge, saying that Kejriwal has also played with the sentiments of the Sikhs
 babbar ne aarope lagaaya ki 2014 main kendra kii satta main aate hi modi sarkaar ne 1984 ke sikh virdohi dangon ke peediton ke liye 5 lakh rupye prati parivaar kaa atirikt muaavja dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi or khud grih mantri rajnath singh ne 21 pariwaron ko saal 2015 main ek kaarykram main check die bhi the
 Further work was to be done by the Delhi government, but the Kejriwal government continued to suppress the case for about 10 months and the checks were issued in November 2016 after stiff opposition from the BJP
 babbar ne daawa kiya ki kejariwal sarkaar vigyaapan main ye daawa kar rahi he ki ye muaavja usne diya jabaki sach yah he ki ye bijepi dwaara diya gaya
 Manoj Tiwari said that the dream merchant of Delhi, BJP President Manoj Tiwari described Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal as a dream dealer
 unhone ye baaten kejariwal ke us daawey par kahi jisamen unhone dilli ko landan jaisaa banane ko lekar kiya tha
 Manoj Tiwari alleged that Kejriwal did no work for Delhi
 tiwari ne kaha ki kejariwal ne dilli ko raajnneetik dhokhaa diya or dilli kii janata ko apane bhrashtachari mantriyon par chhod khud dilli ke paise se apni party kaa vistaar karte rahe
 Tiwari sarcastically said that before the dream of making Delhi London, Kejriwal had talked about making Punjab a Canadian in the recent Punjab elections, seeing that Arvind Kejriwal has become a dream dealer
 manoj tiwari ne iske alaava ajay maakan par bhi aarope lagaae
 Tiwari said that the then Congress governments were equally responsible for the condition of the MCD as the present Kejriwal government
 tiwari ne congress se 2 sawaal puche hai
 
 
 1- From 2004 to 2007, the Congress government was in power at the center, Delhi and Municipal Corporation and Ajay Maken was part of that government, then why did not we try something that is doing today? 2- Congress split the corporation in 2012 But even then the economic strength was not noticed nor the seed money was given to the East Delhi Municipal Corporation
 tab ajay maakan kendra sarkaar main mantri the or pi chidambaram desh ke vitt mantri

 The moments spent in bed with a partner are very beautiful for everyone
 in palon kii yaaden hameshaa donon ke dilon main haseen yaaden banakar basii rahati hai
 But during these beautiful memories in the bed, if you do not take care of each other's comfort, this beautiful moment does not seem to be less than a problem, then how to spend a happy moment in the bed, let us tell you - tell your partner what you like It is not that you always take care of your partner's convenience in bed
 kabhi-kabhi unhen bhi apni ichchhaaon or bhavanon ko jaanane kaa mauka den
 While in love with a partner in the bed, tell them what partner's actions you love in bed and which do not, so that your partner can use these actions at the right time to spend moments in the bed and Make it fun
 saathi ko yah bhi bataaen ki aapako aisi koun-si kriyaayein hai, jo behad utsahit karti hai
 Sometimes ask your partner to fulfill these wishes
 aap dekhengi ki saathi ke saath bitaayen aapke ye haseen pal or haseen ho jaaenge
 To make them even more romantic, encourage your partner to tell them how much you love them, tell them how their feeling encourages your body
 agar aapke saathi nit shift main hai, to unhen bataaen ki raat main bistar main unase alag rahanaa aapako pasand nahin he
 If your husband is in an arrangement in which he has to cope with a lot of stress, then tell him how much you love him to reduce his stress
 aap dekhengi ki vah behad relax ho jate hai or bistar ke romani palon ke dauraan vah or adhik utsahit ho jate hai
 Do something new Try spending some new time on Tribe, instead of always doing the same actions, try something new
 hameshaa ek hi prakaar kii kriyaayein naa keval in haseen palon kii mithaas ko kam karti hai, balki in palon kaa anand uthaane se bhi aapako dur le jaati hai
 So try out something new, you and your partner will be able to enjoy these moments twice

 meerut kaa rahane vaala asif pakistani khufia agency iesai ko bhartiya sena kii khufia jaankaree to detaa hi tha, saath hi iesai network main paisa idhar se udhar karne kaa kaam bhi karata tha
 During interrogation, the STF came to know that Asif had given a laptop to an army jawan named Sunit Kumar, posted in Babina unit of Jhansi, on whose spot Sunit was caught
 sanith mul rup se gram andareta, palampur, jila kangra, himachal pradesh kaa rahane vaala he or is samay babina jhaansi kaint main tainaat he
 The SP of STF said that Sunit had gone to the village after taking leave from Asif after taking the laptop
 sunit ne estf ko bataaya ki sena main bhartee hone ke teen maheene baad uski punam prakaash naam kii ek mahila se fasebuk par dosti hui thi
 After this, he started talking to Poonam on Facebook and phone
 punam ne sunit ko bataaya ki vah punjab kii rahane vaali he, lekin philhal florida main rahati he or army par research kar rahi he
 After his induction into the army in December 2012, Poonam took information from Sunit's unit and the surrounding unit
 sunit ne use babina unit kaa number bhi de diya tha
 Poonam also asked Sunit her army number, but she did not say
 haalanki sunit ne punam naam kii is mahila ko apana bank acount number de diya tha
 The woman described Asif as her relative and in June 2014, Asif gave Sunit a laptop
 sunit se kaha gaya ki soochna ikattha karke is laptop main feed kar dena
 There were already some software installed in the laptop and from this laptop, Sunit had also matched and chatting with Poonam
 18 agast ko punam ne sunit ko phone karke laptop ko formet karne ke liye kaha, lekin isse pehle ki sunit aisa karata estf ne use laptop ke saath pakad liya
 Sunit Kumar was arrested under Section 3 / 4 / 9 Official Secret Act 1923 and brought to Meerut Kotwali on Saturday by taking transit remand from ACJM Palampur

 Dear Rocky Yadav, abhi adaalat se sabit hona baaqi he, isliye hatyare rocky yadav nahin likh rahaa
 i will wait for the court's decision and i will write purportedly till then, so, i will write you dear till then, so that the youth like you realize that Aditya too was someone's beloved
 yah jo tum tivi par bol rahe ho ki tum dilli main the, tumne goli nahin chalaai
 Such statements have been made by alleged accused like you
 filmon main aise samvaad to aam hai or is aadhaar par hatyare ko nirdosh sabit karne kaa daawa karne vaale farzi ghaagh vakil bhi aam hai
 Police investigation is different from your statement
 police kaa kahana he ki tumne jurm kabool kiya he or jis hathiyaar se hatya hui he, use baraamad kiya gaya he, isliye adaalat kaa faisalaa aane tak tum aaropee ho, hatyare nahin
 Your mother must be rightly saying that you are not that kind of boy
 aajkal filmon kii tarah raajnneeti main maanon kii nautanki ham log rose dekh rahe hai
 Mothers of politics should understand that their tears are not like the tears of Javed Akhtar Saheb's mothers, they cannot be
 aajkal kai mantri or vidhayak har baat ko 'main bhi ek maa hum' kii nautanki se dhankane lagi hai
 It is the biggest lie that one mother knows the other mother
 satya yah he ki rocky kii maa or aditya kii maa ke dard main bahut fark he
 There is a lot of difference between Rohit Vemula's mother and a minister's mother
 tumhaari maa jail se laut aane kii aas laga sakati he
 Aditya's mother cannot wait, so tell your mother to stop 'maa maa'
 tumhaari maa agar maanon kaa dard samajhatin to tumhen lakhon rupee kaa revolver lene nahin detii
 Mothers do not dream of giving revolvers to sons
 bandook to bandook, tumhaara naam bhi mohalle ke chaliya jaisaa he
 Anyway, it has nothing to do with the incident
 police kahati he ki tumhaare naam par ek karod kii car he
 At the age of 20 you drive a crore car! Obviously, your mother was neither making you a good boy, nor thinking of other mothers
 tumhaare sangi-saathi ke bare main jaankaree se bhi pataa chalegaa ki tum kinaki sohabat main uthte-baithte rahe ho
 Who helped you get a revolver license
 suna he ki kai dalon ke rajanetaaon ke putr tumhaare mitra hai
 If you have money, who will not be your friend? zaahir he, tumhaari maa ne tumhen acha betaa banane ke liye ek karod kii car or lakhon kii revolver nahin di hogi
 If you were good, do not take such a picture with a revolver
 koshish to tumhaari olympian jaise dikhne kii he, magar lag nahin rahe ho
 Rocky, i am a matriculate from the state where you are a small-time hero
 tumhaare jaise anek rocky ke papa vidhayak hai, thekedaar hai, police main hai
 You are like a part of each party's family
 aise hero ko ham 'tinahaia' hero kehete hai - matlab sadakchhaap
 Many of these big vehicles have come into our politics, many have lost their minds
 sadak par in gadiyon ko bachaane main har jagah log brake lagaakar logon ko gariyaate mil jate hai
 i look every day in Delhi
 log car se utarkar marpet karte rahete hai
 They keep threatening under the glass
 kya pataa tum bhi vaise hi ho
 i am not making a legal decision
 tumhaari harkaton kaa saamaajik vishleshan kar rahaa hum
 i absolutely understand that road rage is a serious psychiatry
 kai ghatnaayen darj hai, jinamein hatya bhi hui he
 You will remember the case of Dr
 Narang's murder in Delhi
 kai logon kii tarah tumhen bhi gussa aayaa hoga
 You could not tolerate how a 5 lakh Swift car can overtake a 10 million Range Rover car
 betaa rocky, car chalaanaa ek hunar bhi he
 a moped can also be beaten
 itnaa samajhate to overtek ke sadame ko bardaasht kar lete or aditya ko jane dete
 But 'rage' came to you, that is anger
 tumhen road rej jaise manorog kii chhot nahin milani chahie
 You come from a political family
 pita argedy ke netaa hai or mata jediu kii vidhayak
 It is heard that father also has the ability to be called Bahubali, so you would think that there are Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar at home
 tumhiin nahin, bihar main tamaam dalon ke kai vidhayak putron kaa yahi haal ho saktaa he
 Some sons are also gentlemen, but most do not get ahead of Rocky and Vicky's mentality
 meraa hi ek classmet he, jiske pita kai saal mantri rahe
 Probably still will, but he never said that the father is a minister
 cycle se college aa jaataa tha
 So Rocky, the power of power must have come inside you
 usee ke nashe main tumne car roki or jhagada kiya
 Your anger must have gone to the seventh sky and you allegedly shot, so your case is different
 bihar ke mukhyamantri se apil karata hum ki do maheene ke andar is maamle ko anjaam par pahunchaakar dikhaaen
 Sell your one crore car in junk and dig a well in a village with his money
 jis raajnneeti ke kaaran tumhaara hausala bad gaya tha, aaj vahi raajnneeti yah dekhegi ki tumhaare maamle main jaldi faisalaa aae
 This will save many Rocky leaders in Bihar, they will come on the way
 aditya kii hatya kaa tumhaare jail jane se zyaada bada insaaf yah hoga

 The truth is that there is a lot of difference between the pain of Rocky's mother and Aditya's mother
 rohit vemula kii maa or kisi mantri ke maa hone main bahut antar he
 Your mother may look forward to returning from prison
 aditya kii maa aas nahin laga sakati he, isliye apni maa se kaho ki 'maa maa' band kare
 If your mother understands the pain of mothers, then she does not let you take a revolver of millions of rupees
 maanon kaa sapana beton ko revolver dena nahin hota he
 Gun, gun, your name is also like the trick of the locality
 kair, iskaa ghatana se koi taalluq nahin he
 The police says that you have a car worth ten million
 20 kii umr main tum ek karod kii car chalaate ho! zaahir he tumhaari maa na to tumhen ek acha ladkaa bana rahi thi, na duusari maataaon ke bare main soch rahi thi
 Information about your partner will also show that you have been sitting in your relationship
 tumhen revolver kaa license dilwane main kisne madad kii
 Have heard that the sons of politicians of many parties are your friends
 paisa he, to koun mitra nahin hoga tumhaara
 Obviously, your mother would not have given you a crore car and a revolver of lakhs to be a good son
 tum achche hote to revolver lekar aisi tasviir nahin khinchaate
 You try to look like an Olympian, but you are not looking
 rocky, tum jis rajya ke chhutbhaiya hero ho, main vahiin se metric paas hum
 Many Rocky's fathers like you are mlas, are contractors, are in the police
 har dal ke khandaanon main tum jaise hai
 We call such a hero a 'tinhaiya' hero - that is, the road
 hamaari raajnneeti main ye jo badi gaadiyaan ai hai, unase bahuton kaa dimaag karaab hua he
 Everywhere people save brakes on the road, people get brakes by applying brakes
 dilli main to rose dekhtaa hum
 People get hit by a car and continue to fight
 sheesha neeche kar dhamkaate rahete hai
 Do you know you are the same main kanoonee faisalaa nahin kar rahaa
 Socially analyzing your antics main bilkul samajhataa hum ki road rej ek gambhir manorog he
 Several incidents have been recorded, including murder
 tumhen dilli main doctor naarang kii hatya kaa maamla yaad hi hoga
 Like many people, you too must have felt angry
 tum bardaasht nahin kar sake hoge ki paanch lakh kii swift car ek karod kii range rover car ko kaise overtek kar sakati he
 Son Rocky is also a skill driving car
 moped vaala bhi maat de saktaa he
 Had he understood this much, he would have tolerated the shock of overtake and let Aditya go
 magar tumhen 'rej' aayaa, yani gussa aayaa
 You should not get psychiatric relaxation like road rage
 tum ek raajnneetik khandaan se aate ho
 Father is leader of RJD and mother is JDU MLA
 suna he, pita bahubali kahalaane kii yogyata bhi rakhte hai, isliye tumhen lagata hoga ki ghar main hi lalu yadav or nitish kumaar hai
 Not only you, the same situation can happen for many MLA sons of all parties in Bihar
 kuch putr log sajjan bhi hote hai, magar zyaadaatar rocky or viki kii maansikta se aage nikal nahin pate
 i have a classmate whose father was a minister for many years
 shaayad ab bhi honge, magar vah kabhi bataata hi nahin tha ki pita mantri hai
 Used to come to college by bicycle
 to rocky, tumhaare bheetar satta kaa gurur bhi aayaa hoga
 You stopped the car and quarreled with that
 tumhaara gussa saatven aasmaan par gaya hoga or tumne kathith rup se goli maar di, isliye tumhaara maamla alag he
 i appeal to the Chief Minister of Bihar to show this case to its conclusion within two months
 tumhaari ek karod kii car kabad main bechakar uske paise se kisi gaanv main kuan khudva den
 Due to the politics which had boosted your spirits, today the same politics will see that your case will be decided soon
 aisa hone se bihar main netaaon ke bahut se rocky batch jaaenge, ve raste par aa jaaenge
 It would be a greater justice to kill Aditya than going to jail
 tumhaari mata kii sadsyta radd kar kisi dhang ke yuva ko emelsi banaaen
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar or the speaker of Bihar Legislative Assembly should call a two-day conference for mlas of all parties and their immediate families where social training should be imparted from member to driver
 bataane ke liye ki vidhayak or parivaar ke bich kis tarah ke sambandh hone chahie
 How the public conduct of the MLA can discredit the family and how the conduct of the family to the MLA
 sadasyon se badi gadiyon kii tamaam jaankaree maangi jaae or poocha jaae ki aapke alaava parivaar ke kitne sadasyon ke paas aisi gaadi he
 The members should be told how to behave when the car collides with the car of an ordinary citizen or does an overtake
 mantri yaa vidhayak kii panjikrut car ke bheetar ek sandesh chipkaaya janaa chahie ki yah vidhayak kii car he
 Car is not an MLA
 driver or parivaar ke sadsy aukaat main rahen
 Congratulations to the SSP of Gaya Police, but nothing is going to happen in one case
 noujvaan esaspi ko bhi aise gaadivaanon kaa shivi lagaakar bataanaa chahie ki yah car, jo aapane khridi he, vah dekhne main badi he, magar isamen baithkar aap kanoon se bade nahin ho jate
 Learn to respect small cars, cyclists, rickshaws and pedestrians

 Learn to respect small cars, cyclists, rickshaws and pedestrians
 tippaniyan a citizen of your state raveesh kumaar Many of these big vehicles have come into our politics, many have lost their minds
 sadak par in gadiyon ko bachaane main har jagah log brake lagaakar logon ko gariyaate mil jate hai
 i look every day in Delhi
 log car se utarkar marpet karte rahete hai
 They keep threatening under the glass
 kya pataa tum bhi vaise hi ho
 i am not making a legal decision
 tumhaari harkaton kaa saamaajik vishleshan kar rahaa hum
 i absolutely understand that road rage is a serious psychiatry
 kai ghatnaayen darj hai, jinamein hatya bhi hui he
 You will remember the case of Dr
 Narang's murder in Delhi
 kai logon kii tarah tumhen bhi gussa aayaa hoga
 You could not tolerate how a 5 lakh Swift car can overtake a 10 million Range Rover car
 betaa rocky, car chalaanaa ek hunar bhi he
 a moped can also be beaten
 itnaa samajhate to overtek ke sadame ko bardaasht kar lete or aditya ko jane dete
 But 'rage' came to you, that is anger
 tumhen road rej jaise manorog kii chhot nahin milani chahie
 You come from a political family
 pita argedy ke netaa hai or mata jediu kii vidhayak
 It is heard that father also has the ability to be called Bahubali, so you would think that there are Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar at home
 tumhiin nahin, bihar main tamaam dalon ke kai vidhayak putron kaa yahi haal ho saktaa he
 Some sons are also gentlemen, but most do not get ahead of Rocky and Vicky's mentality
 meraa hi ek classmet he, jiske pita kai saal mantri rahe
 Probably still will, but he never said that the father is a minister
 cycle se college aa jaataa tha
 So Rocky, the power of power must have come inside you
 usee ke nashe main tumne car roki or jhagada kiya
 Your anger must have gone to the seventh sky and you allegedly shot, so your case is different
 bihar ke mukhyamantri se apil karata hum ki do maheene ke andar is maamle ko anjaam par pahunchaakar dikhaaen
 Sell your one crore car in junk and dig a well in a village with his money
 jis raajnneeti ke kaaran tumhaara hausala bad gaya tha, aaj vahi raajnneeti yah dekhegi ki tumhaare maamle main jaldi faisalaa aae
 This will save many Rocky leaders in Bihar, they will come on the way
 aditya kii hatya kaa tumhaare jail jane se zyaada bada insaaf yah hoga
 Unsubscribe your mother and make some kind of young MLC
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar yaa bihar vidhansabha ke spikar ko sabhi dalon ke vidhayakon or unke nikatatam pariwaron ke liye do-divasiy sammelan bulaanaa chahie, jahaan sadsy se lekar driver tak kaa saamaajik prashikshan diya jaae
 To tell what kind of relationship should happen between MLA and family
 kis tarah vidhayak kaa saarvajanik aacharan parivaar ko badnaam kar saktaa he or kis tarah parivaar kaa aacharan vidhayak ko
 All information about big trains should be sought from the members and asked how many family members have such a car except you
 sadasyon ko bataaya jaae ki car jab kisi aam naagarik kii car se takaraa jaae yaa koi overtek kar le to kaise bartaav karnaa he
 a message must be affixed within the minister's or legislator's registered car that it is the legislator's car
 car vidhayak nahin he
 The driver and family members stay in position
 gaya police kii esaspi ko badhai, lekin ek maamle main giraftaari se kuch nahin hone vaala
 Young SSP should also organize camp of such carriers that this car, which you have purchased, is big in view, but sitting in it, you do not become bigger than the law
 choti kaaron, cycle savaaron, rickshaw waalon or paidal yatriyon kaa sammaan karnaa seekhen
 The comments tumhaare rajya kaa ek naagarik ravish Kumar main bilkul samajhataa hum ki road rej ek gambhir manorog he
 Several incidents have been recorded, including murder
 tumhen dilli main doctor naarang kii hatya kaa maamla yaad hi hoga

 Wellington had a match against Canterbury at Lancaster Park in Christchurch
 wellington kaa us sijan kaa aakhri match tha or ve jeet ke saath match kaa ant karnaa chaahate the
 On the morning of the last day of the Test match, Wellington announced the end of their innings
 cantarbari ko jeet ke liye 291 ranon kii jarurat thi or uske paas 59 over the
 Canterbury suffered a setback at the start of the inning
 pari jaise ladkadaa gai thi
 The situation had become such that eight wickets had fallen for 196 runs
 lekin lee german or roger ford ne pari ko sambhala or wellington ko lagane laga ki match ab dra kii ore ja rahaa he
 It is said that the Germans, who were the wicketkeepers of the team, were not very good batsmen, at the striking end
 aise main wellington ke morrison or wicketiper captain erv mikasvine, ne milakar ek yojana banaai or bart vains kaa naam saamne aayaa
 Burt had never bowled before
 koi gendbaaji kaa anubhav bhi nahin tha
 He was the batsman of his team and was nearing completion
 kaha jaataa he ki yojana yah thi ki vipakshi team ko ran banane ke liye uksaaya jaae or aise main wicket lekar jami jodi ko todaa jaae or jeet kaa lakshya hasil kiya jaae
 The surprise was that Burt supported the captain's plan and agreed to bowl
 kaha yah bhi gaya ki yojana ke anusaar vipakshi team ko ran banane kaa mauka diya jaae taaki ve jeet ke lakshya ke kareeb pahunch saken or jeetne kii chahat main antim do wicket ganvaa den or match wellington ke paksh main chalaa jaae
 Burt was given the second last over
 tab cantarbari ko jeet ke liye 96 ranon kii jarurat thi or genden thi maatr 12
 
 
 The Germans were currently playing on 75 not out
 team ne 196 ran bana liye the or aath wicket ja chuke the
 Burt started bowling
 pehali 17 genden jo unhone phenki usamen se keval duusari hi sahi gend thi or baaki sab nobal raheen
 Also put several fulltos balls
 morrison kehete hai ki bart ne kuch zyada hi kar diya tha
 That was not the case, the fielders were also in slack mode and many went for boundaries
 chhathi gend par german ne apana shatak puraa kiya or is over kul 77 ran bane
 It includes eight sixes and six fours in addition to three singles
 german ne is over main 70 ran banaae or ford ne do gendon kaa saamana kar paanch ran banaae the
 Two balls in this over were no balls with no runs scored
 is puri yojana kaa khaas pahalu yah rahaa he ki scorcard apadet karne vaale or scorcard likhane vaale khub pareshaan hue
 It happened once that he had to update the scorecard by asking the audience
 yahaan tak ki empire ko gendon ko padhane main kaaphi dikkat hui or over khatm hone ke baad jab yah dekha gaya ki kitni genden phenki gai tab yah sach saamne aayaa or ampiron ne keval paanch gendon ko hi sahi qaraar diya
 The confusion was said to be somewhat normal when Evan Gray came in to throw the final over and by then Canterbury needed 18 runs to win and the Germans put the match on par with 17 runs off the first five balls
 ye match ran dra hua
 But there was nothing to be revealed in the scoreboard, with the scorers still running nervous
 itnaa asamanjas kaa maahaul ban gaya tha ki ampire ford ne match kii aakhri gend se pehle match ko roak diya
 And all the players reached the changing room
 tippaniyan Therefore, it is said that the captain's plans are successful and sometimes backfire
 
 
 yahaan aisa laga ki yojana apni ore hi nuksaan lekar ai
 Morrison says that the debate continued for a long time after the match
 lekin aakhir main hamane trophy jiti
 In this match some balls and runs scored on them were as follows
 
 
 bold genden hi sahi genden maani gayi
 
 
 See ball crew ball progress this over ham baat kar rahe hai gendbaaj bart vans kii
 The talk is in February 1990, the Shell Trophy was a Final Day match
 christchurch ke lancastor park main cantarbari ke khilaaf wellington kaa match tha
 Wellington had their last match of the season and they wanted to end the match with a win
 test match ke antin din kii subah wellington ne apni pari kii samaapti kii ghoshnaa kar di thi
 Canterbury needed 291 runs to win and had 59 overs
 ining kii shuruyaat main hi cantarbari ko jatke lage
 The innings was like a wobble
 haalat kuch aisi ho gai thi ki 196 ranon par aath wicket gir chuke the
 But Lee German and Roger Ford handled the innings and Wellington felt that the match was now going towards a draw
 kaha jaataa he ki german, jo team ke wicketiper the, zyada achche ballebaaj nahin the, striking and par the
 In such a situation, Morrison and wicketkeeper Captain Erv mcsweeney of Wellington came together to form a plan and the name of Burt Vance came up
 bart ne isse pehle kabhi gendbaaji nahin kii thi
 There was no bowling experience either
 ve apni team ke batsman the or unka kariyar samaapti kii ore tha
 It is said that the plan was to provoke the opposition team to score runs and in such a situation, the duo would be broken by taking wickets and to achieve the goal of victory
 aashcharya yah tha ki bart ne captain kii yojana kaa saath diya or gendbaaji karne ko taiyaar ho gaye
 It was also said that according to the plan, the opposition team should be given the chance to score runs so that they can get closer to the winning goal and lose the last two wickets in the desire to win and the match goes in favor of Wellington
 bart ko second last over diya gaya tha
 Then Canterbury needed 96 runs to win and the balls were just 12
 
 
 german is samay 75 naabad ran par khel rahe the
 The team had scored 196 runs and had taken eight wickets
 bart ne gendbaaji shuru kii
 Out of the first 17 balls that he threw, only the second was the right ball and the rest was no
 kai phultos ball bhi daaleen
 Morrison says that Burt did too much
 maamla yahi nahin tha, fielder bhi sust mod main aa gaye the or kai boundry gayi
 On the sixth ball, the German completed his century and this over total 77 runs
 isamen teen singles ke alaava aath chakke or chah chauke shaamil hai
 The German scored 70 runs in this over and Ford had scored five runs facing two balls
 is over main do genden no ball rahi jinamein ran nahin bane
 The special aspect of this entire scheme has been that the scorecard updateers and the scorecard writers were very upset
 kuch ek baar to yah hua ki unhen darshakon se poochkar scorcard apadet karnaa padaa
 Even the umpire had a hard time reading the balls and after the over was over when it was seen how many balls were bowled, the truth came to the fore and the umpires declared only five balls to be correct
 kaha jaataa he ki asamanjas kii sthiti kuch saamaanya hui jab antim over phenkane ke liye evan grey aae or tab tak cantarbari ko jeet ke liye 18 ranon kii jarurat thi or german ne pehali paanch gendon par 17 ran banaakar match barabari par laa diya
 This match was run drawn
 lekin scoreboard main kuch pataa nahin chal rahaa tha, scorer abhi bhi pareshaan chal rahe the
 There was so much confusion that umpire Ford stopped the match before the last ball of the match
 or sabhi khilaadi changing room main pahunch gaye
 The comments isliye kaha jaataa he ki captain kii yojanaayen kaamyaab bhi hoti hai or kabhi ulti bhi pad jaati hai
 
 
 Here it seemed that the plan brought losses on its own
 morrison kehete hai ki match ke kaaphi samay baad tak bahes hoti rahi
 But in the end we won the trophy
 is match main kuch genden or unpar gaye ran is prakaar rahe
 
 
 Bold balls were considered the right balls

 uddhav ne vidhayakon se poocha- dar to nahinshivsena supremeo uddhav thakare ne apane vidhayakon se yah bhi poocha ki vah dar to nahin rahe
 The mlas responded by saying 'no' and also assured their leader that they are all united and with him
 vidhayak vahi karenge, jo vah kahenge
 Uddhav cheering the mlas said that the situation has changed, but it will not affect us
 shivasena ne iske baad sabhi vidhayakon se mumbai main hi rahane ko kaha he
 By late night the meeting, the picture changed in the morning, by late night, the coalition government of Shiv Sena, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Uddhav Thackeray was supposed to be the Chief Minister

 aapke pairon ke tale se jameen khinchne vaale ye kampan badi badi imaaraten ukhaad phenkate hai
 But, in a particular region of the Himalayas that covers the region from Nepal to Afghanistan, here the highest earthquake incidents occur
 kya aapako pataa he ki kyon himalay ke in khaas rigen main hi bukamp kyon aata he
 According to scientific analysis, the part around the Himalayas is known as the Indian Plate
 vahiin duusari ore afghanistan he, isaki ore kaa hissaa uresia plate ke rup main pahachaanaa jaataa he
 The third part associated with these two is the Arab and African plate which is connected to many countries
 himalay ke aasapaas ke in ilaakon main aksar bukamp aane kii vajah hi ye hoti he ki jab ye plates ek-duusare ke kshetra main ghusane kii koshish karte hai to ye ek duusare se ragad khaati hai
 This causes a large amount of energy from the friction of these plates
 isi tej gharshan yaa friction se upar kii dharti dolane lagati he
 Not only this, many times the earth around the area explodes, sometimes for weeks and sometimes for several months, this energy is passed out intermittently and this is why earthquakes keep happening
 jaane - kya kahati he 2012 main chhapi ye research:-research ke mutabik himalay ke sabase mukhya yani kendriya hisse main richter scale par 8 se 8
 There have been many earthquakes of magnitude 5 - large earthquakes have caused deep cracks in this entire area, especially in the year 1934 earthquakes changed the map around the Himalayas
 -1934 main aae bukamp ne to sataha par 150 kilometre lambii daraar bana di thi, jo aaj bhi puri tarah bhari nahin ja saki he
 In the opinion of Himalayan mountaineers made of similar earthquakes, the Indian plate lying miles down in the earth is moving towards the Eurasian plate at the rate of 45 mm per year
 inke khisakane se ye donon plates aapas main ragad rahi hai
 The result of this friction has been the formation of the Himalayas
 jaise jaise in donon plates ke bich gharshan badha, dharti thodaa sa khiski or parvat banataa rahaa
 Today the Himalayas are lifesaving for many countries, but scientists also say that if the friction between these two plates increases, then this mountain can also become the cause of great destruction in the coming time
 sabhapati ne donon hi netaaon ko apni baton ko sabit karne or tathyon ko sadan main dene kaa aadesh diya
 Amarnath Yatra is once again on the target of terrorists, after getting such intelligence input, the security forces have lost sleep
 is baar bhi yatra ko safal banane main lagi sabhi agenciyon ke liye agni pariksha sabit hone ja rahi he
 The main reason for this is that while terrorist activities have increased in Kashmir in recent times, different voices have been heard between the Hurriyat Conference and the terrorist groups
 suraksha balon ko ashanka he ki yatra ko nuksaan pahuchane ke liye aatanki gut bharsak koshish karenge
 There is 21 days left for the start of Amarnath Yatra, so the security forces do not want to take any risk
 isliye apni taiyaariyon ko durust karne main lage hai
 By the way, there has been a history that despite the terrorist attacks, those who participated in the yatra are not nervous
 pichley kareeb saat saalon se aatanki amarnath yatra ko nishaanaa bana bisiyon logon kii hatyaein karne main kaamyaab rahe hai
 There are also reports that the ISI wants to create a ruckus in the state and it is trying to do something that breaks India's anger and anger and patience and for this no good opportunity can be found from Amarnath Yatra
 sarkari taur par is baar paanch lakh se adhik logon ko yatra main shaamil hone kii anumati dene kii baat kahi gai he, to pehle kaa anubhav yahi rahaa he ki shaamil hone waalon kii sankhya 4-5 lakh ke aankade ko har baar paar kar jaati he
 The security forces did not want to take any risk, so all preparations were started a month ago, but weather disturbances turned them on
 natijatan un kshetron kii saaf safai, unhen barudi surangon tathaa aatankwaadiyon se mukt karwaane kaa abhiyaan adhabich main hi he
 The situation is that no one knows how the security of the passengers will be after the revelation of the army officers and all is left to Bholanath
 tippaniyan Security forces believe that despite the winds of peace, Amarnath Yatra is facing the most danger this time
 haalanki yah ab kadavi sachai ban gai he ki tamaam suraksha prabandhon ko datta bataate hue aatanki amarnath yatra ko har saal baari kshati pahunchane main kaamyaab rahete hai
 As a result, this time the security concerns of the security personnel have doubled
 pehali vajah ye he ki 45 kimi lambe durgam or pahari yatra maarg par shaamil hone vaale lakhon shraddhaluon ko suraksha kaise pradaan kii jaaegi to doosraa kaaran aatankwaadi apni maujuudagi ko dikhaane tathaa sijafire se pareshaan maahaul ko bigaadane kii khatir kuch bada kar dikhaane kii firaaq main hai
 In the yatra beginning on 2 July, the security forces did not want to take any risk, yet no one can claim that this time the nefarious plans of the terrorists will not succeed, so everything is left to Bholanath
 isaki khaas vajah he haal ke dinon main jahaan kashmir main aatanki gatividhiyaan badi hai vahiin isko lekar hurriyat conferes or aatanki guton ke bich alag-alag sur sunai dene lage hai
 Security forces suspect that terrorist groups will do their best to damage the yatra
 amarnath yatra ke shuru hone main 21 din kaa samay bachaa he lihaaja surakshabal koi khatra mol nahin lenaa chaahate
 Therefore, we are busy in preparing our preparations
 vaise ab tak kaa itihaas rahaa he ki aatanki hamalon ko baavjood yatra main bhaag lane vaale ghabaraae nahin hai
 For the last nearly seven years, terrorists have been able to kill thousands of people targeting the Amarnath Yatra
 aisi bhi report he ki iesai rajya main hahaakar machaana chaahati he or vah kuch aisa anjaam dene kii koshishon main hai, jisase bharat kaa gussa or bhadke tathaa sabar kaa baandh tut jaae or iske liye amarnath yatra se acha koi avasar unhen nahin mil saktaa
 Officially, this time it has been said to allow more than five lakh people to join the yatra, so the earlier experience has been that the number of attendees crosses the figure of 4-5 lakh each time
 
 surakshabal koi khatra mol nahin lenaa chaahate the, isliye ek maah purv sabhi taiyaariyaan aarambh to kii gai thim parantu mausam kii gadabadiyon ne un par pani pher diya
 Consequently, the cleanliness of those areas, the landmines and the drive to free them from terrorists are in the middle
 sthiti yah he ki senadhikariyon ke rahasyodghatan ke baad yatriyon kii suraksha kaise hogi koi nahin jaanata he or sab bholanath par chhod diya gaya he
 The comments suraksha bal maanate he ki shanti kii bayaar ke baavjood amarnath yatra par is baar sabase adhik khatra mandara rahaa he
 However, it has now become a bitter reality that the terrorists are able to cause huge damage to the Amarnath Yatra every year by calling all security arrangements as Dhata
 natijatan is baar surakshadhikariyon kii chintaa doguni he
 The first reason is how security will be provided to the lakhs of pilgrims joining the 45 km long inaccessible and hilly trekking route, and the second reason is that the terrorists are trying to do something big to show their presence and spoil the atmosphere disturbed by the ceasefire
 
 2 july se shuru hone vaale yatra main surakshabal koi khatra mol nahin lenaa chaahate the, baavjood koi ye daawa nahin kar saktaa ki is baar aatankiyon ke napak mansoobey kaamyaab nahin honge, lihaaja sabakuch bholanath par chhod diya gaya he

 Barack Hussein Obama, the first black president to enter the White House in Washington, will be represented by Obama around the world
 or is aitihaasik maukey par washington main suraksha kaa jo intjaam kiya gaya he, wo isse pehle kabhi nahin tha

 unhone logon se yahi guzarish kii, ki sabko ab milakar kaam main lag janaa chahie, har aadmi haath badaye

 Then, the doctor will make special prayers for the new president, and the prayer song will have the voice of Aretha Franklin
 iske baad up raashtrapati jo biden shapath lenge
 Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court John Roberts will administer Obama's oath of office on January 20 at exactly 11:13

 That means the journey from the White House to the American Parliament House - Capitol Hall
 paanch hazaar logon ke liye ye parade dekhne kaa intazaam he or iske liye 25 dollar kaa tikat sirf ek minute main hi bik gaya
 Now those who will not be able to watch the parade closely, do not want to miss the opportunity to see Obama swearing

 Washington police estimate that nearly four million people from the United States and other countries of the world have caught the path of Washington to witness the swearing-in
 washington se abhi jorge bush kii aupchaarik taur par vidaai nahin hui he
 Yet there is only one color all around Obama's color

 Barack Obama will not go directly to the Capitol Building for the swearing-in, but will leave Blair House and reach St
 John's Church

 In the meantime, all the guests of the country and the world will start coming to Capitol Hill, including senators, people in Obama's new cabinet, former presidents, governors, etc
 Many well-known veterans will arrive
 carch se prarchana ke baad obama carch se niklenge or white house kii taraf ravaanaa honge
 In about ten minutes, Obama's convoy will reach a portico on the North side of the White House

 George Bush will welcome him to the White House, and the two will sit together and chat for a while
 iske baad bush or obama white house se capital building ke liye niklenge
 After this, the inauguration ceremony will begin, for the next fifteen to twenty minutes, all the leaders will speak on stage, and after twenty minutes, Chief Justice of America Roberts will administer the oath to the new President Obama

 The world has known a lot about Obama now, but the world knows very little about his personal life

 Barack Hussein Obama, before knowing about this person, understand the meaning of this name, Barack means that one who has the blessings of the above, and this is also evident from the point where Obama has reached today

 When he was starting a campaign to become president, he promised his wife Michelle that he would give up cigarettes soon, but he still did not keep his promise
 par sab ummid karen ki apane bhaashanon main wo duniya se jo vaada kar rahe hai, use jarur nibhaaen
 Whatever the preparations of Obama's oath in America, some sections in India are also in full enthusiasm
 vaise jaankaar to kehete hai ki obama kaa aana bharat ke liye acchhee khabar he, lekin schuli bachche ye sab kya jaane
 They are happy to put the face of the American President on their face
 ji haa, lakhanu main obama ke mureed kuch schuli bacchon ne sadakon par march nikaali, wo bhi obama kaa mask lagaakar
 Before Obama's coronation, some of his well-wishers recited Sundara Kand for him
 vaise schuli bachche obama ko aatank ke khilaaf majboot rajaneta ke taur par dekh rahe hai, magar apane desh main failaa aatankwaad bhi inke liye bada masalaa he

 'I make films like this, which have big stars
 or main in bade kalakaron ke sath ghatiya filmein banane kii soch bhi nahin sakati
 So i never make inferior films
 ' yah kahana he diarector or koreografar farah khan kaa
 In an interview recently, Farah said that she never makes inferior films
 unki film main vah sab kuch hota he to ek safal bollywood film main hona chahie
 Dance, drama, romance, emotion, action, big stars and all that happens are in Farah Khan's films which should be a successful Bollywood film
 farah khan ne kaha ki, vah aisi hi filmein banaati hai, jo zyada se zyada logon ko pasand aae
 Farah said, 'I want to entertain every kind of audience
 main chaahati hum ki desh ke bi-class ke darshak bhi meri film kaa utana hi lutf uthaaen, jitna britain ke darshak
 Therefore it is very difficult to make such a film
 'farah khan kii aane vaa lee film 'happy new year' ek musical film he, jisamen shahrukh khan, deepika padukon, abhishek bachchan, boman irani, sonu sood or vivaan shah jaise stars najar aaenge
 Also, Jackie Shroff plays the villain in the film
 yah film chori par besd he
 More films have been made in Bollywood on this formula
 lekin farah kahana he ki is film kuch chi jein hai, jo is tarah kii or filmon se unki filmon ko alag karti he

 centre sarkaar ne pan (PAN) ke saath bieometric pahchaan 'aadhaar' ko jodne kii samaysima ko 6 maheene or badhaakar 30 sitambar 2019 kar diya he
 However, it will remain mandatory to mention the Aadhaar number in filing the Income Tax Return (ITR) after the Supreme Court order
 yah chatha mauka he jab sarkaar ne pan ko aadhaar se jodne ke liye samaysima badhaai he
 In fact, in June last year, the government said that every person has to add their biometric identification Aadhaar number with PAN by 31 March
 kendriya pratyaksh kar board (CBDT) ne bayaan main kaha, agar koi vishisht chhot nahin di jaati he to, ab aadhaar sankhya ke bare main soochna dene or pan ko aadhaar sankhya se jodne kii antim tithi 30 sitambar 2019 he
 The CBDT said that such reports have appeared that pans not linked to Aadhaar by 31 March will be declared invalid
 iske baad sarkaar ne maamle par vichaar karte hue inhen aapas main jodne kii antim tithi ko badhaakar 30 sitambar kar diya
 The statement said that of course the last date for linking the Aadhaar number with the PAN or informing it has been made 30 September 2019, along with that it is clarified that while filing the income tax return from April 1, 2019 It will be mandatory to mention or add Aadhaar number
 supreme court ne pichley saal sitambar main kendra sarkaar kii aadhaar yojana ko sanvaidhanik rup se vaid mana tha or is bare main nirnay dete hue kaha tha ki pan aavanton karte samay or iskar ritern daakhil karte hue bieometric pahchaan aadhaar kaa ullekh anivaary bana rahegaa
 a 5-member constitution bench had also said in its judgment that it would not be mandatory to link Aadhaar number with bank accounts and Aadhaar for new connections by telecom service providers
 pichley saal sitambar tak desh main 41 karod pan jari kiye gaye, inamen 21 karod se adhik ko aadhaar se joda gaya he
 The Supreme Court in its order upheld Section 139AA of the Income Tax Act
 iskar kii is dhara main kaha gaya he ki ek july 2017 ko jis vyakti ke paas pan he or vah aadhaar paane ke liye paatr he, use kar prashasan ko apni aadhaar sankhya kii jaankaree deni hogi
 Significantly, the deadline for linking PAN with the Aadhaar number was extended several times
 aakhri baar ise 31 march 2019 tak jodne kii samaysima rakhi gai, jise ab badhaakar sitambar 2019 kar diya gaya he

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Saturday that his government is seriously considering a proposal to implement the odd-even formula in the national capital for 15 days every month
 isi ke saath unhone od-ivan ke duusare charan ke disha-nirdeshon kii ghoshnaa kii
 Addressing the press conference, Kejriwal said that the scheme being implemented from April 15 will be exempted for vehicles carrying women and uniformed school students
 unhone kaha, 'mahila chaalak, sienji sanchalit vaahanon, rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon or unifarm main schuli vidhyaarthiyon ko le ja rahe vaahanon ko sam-visham yojana ke duusare charan main chhot di jaaegi
 'let us tell you that during this press conference held in the Secretariat, Aam Aadmi Army activist Ved Prakash Sharma threw a shoe at CM Kejriwal over the alleged CNG sticker scam
 haalanki, juuta kejariwal tak nahin pahunch paaya
 The police is questioning the worker
 'majboot parivahan pranali ke bina sthai nahin'conference ko sambodhit karte hue kejariwal ne kaha ki har maheene ek pakhwaade ke dauraan ise lagu kiye jane par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he, kyonki majboot saarvajanik parivahan pranali ke bina ise sthai nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The only major change in the second phase of the odd-even formula compared to the first phase is that the car carrying children in the school uniform will be exempted from it
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki viipi, sienji kaaron, mahilaon dwaara chalaai ja rahi kaaron, apaat chikitsa sthiti or viklang logon ko le ja rahi kaaron ko is niyam se chhot milegi
 This is the problem in the new rule
 Kejriwal admitted that it is a little difficult to keep the cars carrying children in the school uniform under the exemption, as all such vehicles cannot stand to bring children back from school
 mukhyamantri ne kaha, 'is maamalon main do chijen ho sakati hai
 In the first case, a vehicle leaves the child at school, stands there and returns the child
 lekin aise bhi maamle ho sakate hai ki ek taraf se car main baccha maujuud nahin ho
 There can be some problems in this situation
 ' a major accident took place in Kushinagar in Uttar Pradesh on Thursday morning
 maanav rahit railway crossing par skool vine (tata magic) train kii chapet main aa gai
 13 children died in this accident
 aisa nahin he maanav rahit railway phatak par ye pehla haadasa he
 Accidents have been happening even before this
 thik isse miltaa julata haadasa upi ke bhadohi main 2016 ke july maah main hua tha
 It is worth noting that even at that time it was the same statement of the railway which is being given today
 is tarah se aap kah sakate hai ki 2 saal, 2 haadase or 2 rail mantri badalane ke baad bhi railway ke bayaan ek jaise hi hai
 What is that statement? After the Kushinagar accident, the railway says that the accident happened due to the negligence of the driver
 crossing par get mitra maujuud tha, jisane driver ko ishaara bhi kiya, lekin driver ke dwaara ishaara nahin dekha gaya
 At the same time, it is also being said that the driver had installed earphones, due to which he did not hear the sound of the train
 bhadohi haadase main bhi aisa hi tha bayanjulai 2016 main uttar pradesh ke bhadohi main bhi kushinagar jaisaa haadasa hua tha
 At that time, a school van collided with a high speed train at unmanned railway crossing, in which 8 children were killed
 iske baad tab ke rail mantri suresh prabhu ne twit kar ha tha ki, get mitra ne driver ko rokane kii koshish kii lekin driver ne uski chetavanee ko ansuna kiya, jis vajah se ye haadasa hua he
 Gate Mitra was available at the time of accident but sadly van driver ignored his warning which resulted in this sad incident There are many similarities
 jaise donon hi maamalon main skool vine train kii chapet main ai he
 Not only this, in the initial investigation also, the same theory has been put forward in both cases
 jiske mutabik, maanav rahit phatak par get mitra maujuud tha
 Also, the driver had installed earphones, due to which he could not hear the sound of the train
 badal gaye do mantri, lekin nahin badale bayanin do haadason ke bich do rail mantri bhi badal chuke hai
 Where Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu was during the Bhadohi accident
 vahiin, kushinagar haadase ke dauraan rail mantri piyush goyal hai
 But the railway statements in these two years are the same

 a woman was allegedly shot and injured after a gang rape over a property dispute in Sitapur district of Uttar Pradesh
 police sutron ne darj report ke hawaale se bataaya ki laharpur thana kshetra ke ek gaanv main munna, kallu, gaffaar tathaa kaleem naamak vyaktiyon ne shanivaar kii raat ko ek mahila ko uske ghar se agava kar liya or samuhik balaatkaar kiya
 When he protested, he shot her in the leg
 tippaniyan Superintendent of Police Bibi Singh said that the accused people do the work of selling property
 aarope he ki mahila ke pati ne unke jariye apni jameen bechney se inkaar kar diya tha or isi se naaraaz hokar aropiyon ne is vaardaat ko anjaam diya
 He said that all the accused have been arrested by filing a case
 peedit mahila ko jila aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he

 Australian Commonwealth Games Association, currently satisfied with the security arrangements for the Delhi Commonwealth Games, today said that it is keeping a close watch on the preparations for these games starting on October 3
 sangh ke mukhya kaaryakari peri krasswhite ne kaha, ‘hamane pichley shuukravaar ko khilaadiyon ko taaja suraksha circular bheje hai
 Our emphasis is on security of airports, places, sports villages, traffic routes and hotels
 philhal ham santusht hai lekin ham najar rakhe hue he
 'he said,' In India we will be provided armed guards and undercover guards in buses
 hamen apane surakshakarmi le jane kii bhi anumati mil gai he
 Crosswhite said that it was a good sign that so far no Australian player has ruled out playing for security reasons
 unhone kaha, ‘suraksha or bachaav par hamaari paini nazren hai
 So far no player has withdrawn the name due to this
 iskaa shrey kochon or mahasanghon ko jaataa he
 ' upi vidhansabha chunaav ke liye 23 farvari ko chauthe charan kaa matdaan hoga
 Polling will be held in 53 seats in 12 districts in the fourth phase
 jin jilon main chauthe charan ke chunaav hone hai, unamem raibareli, elahabaad, pratapgarh, jhaansi, lalitpur, mahoba, banda, hamirpur ,chitrakoot or fatehpur shaamil hai
 Allahabad district has 12 assembly seats, out of which eight seats are held by Samajwadi Party, three seats by BSP and one seat by Congress
 saal 2012 main vidhansabha chunaav main ek seat bijepi ke khate main bhi ai thi, lekin 2015 ke upachunaav main vah seat bhi samaajawaadee party ke khate main chali gai thi
 Despite having 2 Lok Sabha mps with 12 mlas in Allahabad region, Allahabad has not got representation in the state government nor in the central government
 vah bhi tab jab 12 vidhansabha seat main se aath samaajawaadee party ke paas hai or donon loksabhaa siton par bijepi kaa qabza he
 The only relief for the BJP is that the BJP has appointed the president of the state from Allahabad
 aam baatcheet main elahabaad ke log centre or rajya sarkaar main elahabaad ke pratinidhitiv nahin hone par apni naaraazgi jataate hai, unka maananaa he ki kisi bhi kshetra ke vikaas ke liye sarkaar main local pratinidhitiv hona bahut zaruri hota he
 This time Allahabad district is very important for BJP, because of the Uttar Pradesh BJP President Keshav Prasad Maurya
 vah elahabaad jile kii phulpur loksabhaa seat se saansad hai or elahabaad west seat se bhaajapa ne apane rashtriya sachiv or purv pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri ke naati siddharth nath singh par apana daav lagaaya he
 Senior BJP leader Murali Manhor Joshi has been a two-time MP from Allahabad Lok Sabha seat
 bijepi ke liye sabase badi samasya yah he ki murali manohar joshi is puure chunaav main nadaarad rahe he
 On the other hand, the resentment among the local leaders about Siddharth Nath Singh is that he is an outsider and he has been taken off parachute directly from Delhi
 samaajawaadee party ne apni party kii prachaar kii kaman yahaan se samaajawaadee party ke sabase bade qaddavar netaa or elahabaad se kai baar saansad rahe revathiraman singh ko saunpi he jo filhal rajyasabha main party ke saansad hai
 Between the Karnataka election results, when the BJP leaders were busy celebrating the victory and their spokesmen were making statements in the news channels, then two Congress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Ashok Gehlot were trying to stop the BJP in power in the state
 Were working on aakhirkaar congress ko isamen safalataa milti dikh rahi or nateezon ke bich hi congress ne jedies ke saath sarkaar banane kaa bada elaan kar diya
 No single party has got an absolute majority in the Karnataka assembly election results
 bijepi sabase badi party jarur banakar ubhari he, lekin jaadui aankade se kareeb saat seat dur dikh rahi he
 At present, the Congress is getting 77 seats and JDS is getting 38 seats
 bijepi karnataka main chunavi jang fatah karne ke khushi main dubi hui thi, jabaki trishanku vidhansabha kii haalat dekhakar congress khel karne main jute gai
 The Congress has become an obstacle in bjp's path of power
 gulam nabi aaazaad or ashok gahalot ne congress kii purv adhyaksh sonia gandhi se baat kii or puri raajnneetik haalat par charchaa kii
 After this, JDS announced its support
 congress ne jedies ke saath milakar sarkaar banane kaa daanv chalakar bijepi ko baikfoot par laa diya he
 BSP supremo Mayawati has also been engaged in this work to talk to JDS
 mayawati nekarnatakamein jedies ke saath milakar chunaav ladi hai or unki party ke ek vidhayak ne jeet bhi darj kii he
 In such a situation, Mayawati negotiated with former Prime Ministers HD Deve Gowda and Kumaraswamy and convinced them to form a government with the Congress
 itnaa hi nahin, unhone jedies ko kisi bhi keemat main bijepi ke saath na jane kii bhi salaah di he
 After the JDS agreed, Congress chief ministers Siddaramaiah and Mallikarjun Kharge also decided to form a government after talking to Dev Gowda
 congress or jedies ke bich tay hua he ki kumaraswami mukhyamantri honge or congress ke cote main dipti siem kaa pad milegaa
 For this, the name of Parmeshrara has also been suggested
 iske alaava is gathbandhan main 34 mantri honge, jisamen se congress ke cote se 20 or jedies ke cote se 14 mantri honge
 Congress's proposal has been approved by JDS leader Kumaraswamy and will now present the claim to the Governor to form the government
 congress or jedies ke bich pakati khichdi ko bhaanpakar bijepi netaa bhi sakriy ho gaye hai
 The party high command has sent three of its cabinet ministers to Kokarnataka
 yediurppa dilli aane vaale the, lekin unhen vahiin rukne kii salaah di gai or wo rajyapal se milane ja rahe hai
 In such a situation, it will be interesting to see who wins the battle of power in Karnataka

 na keval sthaneey raksha adhikariyon or police ne bhartiya chetavaniyon ko nazarandaaj kiya, balki rajnatik prashasan jo ki raashtrapati maitreepala sirisena or pradhanmantri ranil vikramsinghe ke bich badhate matbhedon se pangu ho gaya he, bhi naakaam sabit hua
 In January 2015, Shrenbow was formed to oust Mahinda Rajapaksa from the presidency and Sirisena also defeated Rajapaksa with the support of Wickremesinghe's United National Party
 baad main donon ke rishton main daraar aa gai
 Sirisena was not invited to the National Security Council (NSC) meeting a few weeks ago by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe
 hamalon ke baad ek press conference main mantri or pravaktaa rajita senaratne ne kaha ki sarkaar ko 'bahut, bahut khed' he, lekin ise sambhavit hamalon ke bare main koi purv chetavanee nahin mili thi

 He said, "however, the information was shared only among some officials

 In Sahu's opinion, a clash is possible if the tigers also come to live in Kuno Palpur, the second home of the Babbar lions

 The main reason is the same area and food

 It is being told that on Friday, Rahul can meet the farmers' delegation and take stock of the preparations for the party's mega farmers rally
 unke media ko bhi sambodhit karne kii sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he
 Earlier, Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh, known for his outrageous remarks, had instructed Hirahul in gestures
 unhone kaha tha ki rahul ko raajnneeti main or zyada dikhnaa chahie or ise part time job kii tarah nahin liya ja saktaa
 Now the time has come to lead: Digvijay said, "we lost the battle of perception"
 rahul khud ko us tarah project nahin kar sake, jaise modi ne kiya
 He should have been more aggressive during the Lok Sabha elections
 unhen muddon par baat kerani chahie, media se baat kerani chahie
 Rahul should now come strongly and connect with people on all major issues
 unhen koi bhi nahin roak rahaa he, lekin shaayad pehle vah puri tarah taiyaar nahin the yaa vah purv pradhanmantri (manmohan singh) ko prabhaavaheen nahin karnaa chaahate the
 But now the time has come to give the message that he is leading the Congress in every way
 ' angreji website 'ibien live' ne yah khabar di he
 It was earlier reported that Rahul would return from leave on 12 or 13 April
 lekin ab congress sutron ne unki vaapasi kaa nayaa shedul bataaya he
 By not taking part in the high-level meeting related to Ambedkar Jayanti, Rahul maintained the speculation regarding his return
 19 april ko congress kii kisaan raily main unki maujuudagi tay maani ja rahi he
 On Monday, senior Congress leader AK Antony was seen struggling with media questions related to Rahul's return
 unhone kaha, 'kitni baar yah baat saaf kerani padegi
 Rahul will definitely be attending the April 19 rally
 'rahul ke chuttee par jane ko lekar raajnneetik galiyaaron main tarah-tarah ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai
 Some people believe that Rahul was angry with the loss of his head and therefore went on leave
 vahiin kuch kaa maananaa he ki 'rilonching' ke makasad se tay plan ke tahat vah chuttee par gaye hai or is dauraan vah apnisamajhadaari, bhaashan or kaaryastylee ko majabootabana rahe hai
 Some people are also predicting that he will soon take over as Congress president
 rishi panchami rishiyon kii khaaspujakar den, isse vyapaar or naukari sab acchhee ho jaaegi
 Worship the seven sages on Sage Panchmipar
 saat rishi he- kashyap, atri, bharadwaj, vishwamitra, gautam, jamadagani, vashisht or saath main guru vashishtha kii patni arundhati kii bhi puja karen
 No work is successful without his blessings
 inhen rishiyon ke naam par gotra ke naam hote hai, saare hindu in rishiyon ke vanshaj maane jate hai
 Worship is successful only by worshiping the name of gotra, therefore, in every puja, one should take the name of his sage
 rishi panchami ko apane gotra ke rishi kaa naam likhen
 Offer fruits, flowers, sweets on it
 shuukravaar kii rishi panchami ko namak kaa seven nahin kiya jaataa or ek baar bhojan kiya jaataa he, dahi chaaval khaaya jaataa he lekin is din rishi panchami kii katha zarur sunani chahie
 What is in the Kathasatyuga of Rishi Panchami, there was a priest named Sumitra, a scholar of the Aur Vedas, in the kingdom of King Thousay, named Shayanjit
 sumitra kheti dwaara apana parivaar chalaata thousaki patni kaa naam jayshri tha
 Both worked in the fields, once Sumitra was ill, his wife inadvertently did the housework in an unholy condition without bathing and even touched her husband
 unki mrityu ke baad brahman sumitra kaa janm bail ke rupamen hua or uski patni kaa janm ek kute ke rup menhua
 Both return to their own homes
 bail or kute ne kya kiya?brahman ke putr kaa naam sumati tha, wo bhi vedon kaa vidwaan thousane bail or kuttiya ko apane ghar main rakhaa hua thaek baar sumati ne mata-pita kaa shraadh kiya, brahmanon kebhojan ke liye kheer banaai, kheer main ek saanp gir gaya or kheer zahreeli ho gayito kutta bani brahmani ne yah sab dekh liya tha, usne sumati ko paap se bachaneke liye sumati kii patni ke saamne kheer ko chhu liya , is par sumati kii patni nebina samajhe , jalati lakdi se kute kii pitayee kar di or use khaanaa bhi nahi diyabad main kute ne bail bane brahman ko sachhee baat bataai to unke bete sumati nesab baat sun lee or usko samaj main aa gaya kii yah bail or kutta asal menuske mata-pita he jinhone pashu ke rup main doosraa janm liya he
 How did Sumati's parents become a man with a dog and an ox? Sumati sadly went to a sage for the salvation of the parents, the rishi told a remedy for the parents' salvation from the animal vagina
 The rishi told Bhado Shukla Panchami of the sage Panchami Fast: On that day worship your clan and eat some grain while plowing with the bull
 sumati ne aisa hi kiya or mata-pita ko pashu yoni se mukti mil gayi
 He became human again in the new birth dilli ke conot place main rama house building main somvaar kii subah aag lag gai
 The fire broke out at the NIIT Center located on the first floor of this building
 dilli agnishman vibhaag is aag ko bujhane main laga he lekin ab tak is par kaabo nahin paaya ja sakaa he
 There are 12-13 fire tenders to extinguish the fire and a sky lift is also being used for rescue operations
 raahat kii baat yah he ki ab tak isamen kisi ke hataahat hone kii koi khabar nahin he
 An official of the Delhi Fire Service said the fire broke out in the building Rama Market
 unhone kaha, ‘aag lagane kii ghatana ke bare main subah 7
 It was reported at 50 pm
 aag bujhane ke liye damakal ke 10 se adhik vaahanon ko ghatnasthal ke liye ravaanaa kiya gaya
 'the cause of the fire is not yet known
 police ne bhi maukey par pahunch kar halaat kaa jayja liya
 Police have started looking into the cause of the fire
 centre sarkaar ke do saal puure hone par elahabaad main congress kaaryakartaaon ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf ek anokhaa poster jari kiya he
 In this poster, the promises made by the Modi government to the public have been termed as fraud
 saath hi kaha gaya he ki agar kisi ne sabit kiya ki centre ne ek bhi vaada puraa kiya to use 1 lakh kaa inaam diya jayega
 In the poster issued by the Congress workers, a reward of one lakh rupees was offered by the Congress, that Kimodi government has completed two years, but the promises made by Modi to the public have not been fulfilled
 poster main yah bhi likhaa he ki agar kisi ko lagata he ki modi sarkaar ne apane sabhi vaade puure kiye to vah tamaam vaadon kaa lekha jokha dastavej ke saath dikhaae
 He will be given a reward of one lakh rupees from the Congress
 poster main uthaae gaye bijepi ke chunavi muddeis poster main berozegaron ko naukari, ganga kii safai, ram mandir kaa nirmaan, dhara 370, bhrashtachar, daaud ibrahim kii bharat vaapasi, mahangaai,kaala dhan or bank khatemen 15 lakh jaise muddon kaa zikr kiya gaya he
 This poster is being discussed a lot in the city
 uttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke puraane sarkari bangale ke vivaad main nayaa mode aa gaya he
 Rejecting allegations of sabotage in the bungalow, the Samajwadi Party blamed the Yogi government for the opposite and described the entire episode as a conspiracy to defame the former CM
 udhar tahas-nahas bangale kii tasviren soshal media par viral ho gai hai
 There are allegations that Akhilesh Yadav sabotaged this to hide his luxury in a government bungalow
 khud yogi sarkaar ke mantri bhi ye aarope laga rahe hai
 The question is, what were the things that were kept in the government bungalow which Akhilesh Yadav either took with him or got destroyed while vacating the bungalow
 bangale main chat se lekar farsh or badminton court tak ukhda padaa he
 Tiles are dislodged from the floor, floor carpet has been removed from the floor, electrical wiring including switches have been removed
 har kamare main todphod hui
 AC to switch boards were missing
 akhilesh yadav par sawaal isliye bhi uth rahe hai kyonki unase pehle supreme court ke hi aadesh par purv mukhyamantri or rajasthan ke governor kalyaan singh, purv mukhyamantri mayawati, kendriya grahamantri or purv mukhyamantri rajnath singh ne bhi sarkari bangalon ko khaali kiya, lekin aisa najaara kahin dekhne ko nahin mila
 Uttar Pradesh Transport Minister Swatantra Dev Singh said that the first government bungalow had expensive items installed, hundred AC, Italy tiles, flooring etc
 and when it came to vacating the bungalow, it was vandalized to hide everything
 Has gone
 swatantra dev singh ne kaha, 'ye log aaleeshaan jivan jite the or apana awaas isi prakaar banaate the
 They have invested Rs 100 crore in their bungalows by plundering the earnings of the sweat and sweat of the poor
 aap rajnath singh kaa bangala dekhiye, kalyaan singh bangala dekhiye vahaan ye sab nahin laga he
 Putting 100-100 AC, Italy tiles, what does it mean? ”however, the Samajwadi Party says it is the opposite
 party ne kaha he ki ye akhilesh yadav ko badnaam karne kii sajeesh he
