 The foundation day of RJD will be celebrated on 5 July, this time like every year
 mukhya kaarykram patna main argedy ke pradesh karyaalay parisar main manaaya jayega
 Although there is nothing new in celebrating rjd's foundation day, this will probably be the first time that the day will be celebrated in the absence of the party's national president Lalu Prasad Yadav
 praapt jaankaree ke anusaar is baar argedy sthapana diwas samaaroh kaarykram kaa netritv or udghaatan lalu ke chote bete or purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav karenge
 Other national officials and leaders of the party including former chief minister Rabri Devi, former health minister Tej Pratap Yadav, party vice-president Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, former MP Jagadanand Singh, vice-president Shivanand Tiwari, former MP Kanti Singh, MP Jayaprakash Narayan Yadav, MP Bulo Mandal Will be present gauratlab he, pichley 1 saal main lalu parivaar main baari uthal puthal dekhne ko mili he
 While RJD was in power on the occasion of the party's foundation day last year, this time it has been ousted from power
 lalu prasad yadav kechara ghotalemaamle main doshi qaraar die jane ke baad 27
 Serving a 5-year sentence
 haalanki, philhal vah medical ground par jamaanat par baahar hai or mumbai ke asian heart institute main apana ilaaj karvaa rahe hai
 However, the interesting thing that is going to happen on the occasion of Foundation Day this time is what is the attitude of the family on the way in which the developments in the Lalu family have come up in the past
 pichley maheene tej pratap yadav ne party ke khilaaf baghawat ke swar apanaate hue elaan kar diya tha ki party ke andar jo bhi asaamaajik tatv hai unako vah baahar kaa rasta dikhaaenge magar is puure maamle ko tool pakadta dekh jald hi party damege control mod main aa gai
 On June 11, on the occasion of Lalu's birthday, the entire family appeared together, dismissing speculation of a power struggle
 isi hafte tej pratap yadav ne ek baar phir parivaar ke andar sab kuch thik nahin hone ke sanket de die jab unhone apane fasebuk acount par likh diya ki unki maa rabari devi unki baaten nahin sunati hai
 Tej Pratap, referring to two RJDK leaders Om Prakash Yadav and Subodh Rai on his Facebook page said that both these leaders are tarnishing his image, but despite complaining to Rabri Devi that no action is being taken against him
 yah maamla bhi jab tool pakadaney laga to tej pratap ne maamle ko shant karne ke liye kah diya ki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or bhaajapa ne unke fasebuk acount ko hack kar liya tha
 One thing has become clear from these two incidents that everything is not right inside the Lalu family and this time on the foundation day big and small leaders of the party will be watching
 aise main dekhnaa hoga ki jab lalu kaa puraa parivaar is maukey par ek saath hoga to party ko ekajute rakhane ke liye kya sandesh detaa he? Maruti Suzuki India, the country's largest car maker, plans to launch the multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) Ertiga by the end of March this year

 The victim said, "when i was taken to the police station, the policemen there asked me to file a case against the boy
 maine unase kaha ki hamaare bich koi galat sambandh nahin hai, isliye main aisa nahin kar sakati
 After this the policemen said that we will not tell you anything, just make a case against you boy, because he is Muslim
 'ladki ne bataaya ki jab mere gharavaale vahaan pahunche to police ne unase bhi mere dost ke khilaaf cese karne ke liye kaha
 But my family also refused

 (@smnehad) June 18, 2017 janata dal (you) ke netaa or purv mukhyamantrinithish kumarbhale hi puraane 'janata parivaar' ko ekbar phir ekajute karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hon, magar rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ke varisht netaa or purv kendriya mantri raghuvansh prasad singh maanate hai ki bihar vidhansabha chunaav main rajd 'bade bhai' kii bhoomika main rahegaa
 Elections in Bihar are to be held next year
 raghuvansh ne kaha ki pichley chunaav ko aadhaar banaakar hi agle chunaav kii ruparekha taiyaar kii jaati he
 In the Lok Sabha elections, RJD got more votes than JD (U)
 aise main tay he ki vidhansabha chunaav main gathbandhan ke tahat rajd bade bhai kii bhoomika main chunaav maidan main utrega
 He said that rjd's palace is heavier than JD (U)
 vidhansabha chunaav main siton kaa bantwaaraa bhi loksabhaa chunaav main mili maton ke aadhaar par hi hoga
 When asked about the activities of the Bihar government, Raghuvansh said in his own style, 'first Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi is faring from Nitish Kumar himself
 mukhyamantri maanjhi pehle alaay-balaay bolte the, jisase logon ke bich galat sandesh jaataa tha
 It is heard that Nitish has called and explained to him
 'rajd netaa ne spasht taur par kaha ki matadaata maujuuda sarkaar ke kaaryo kaa moolyankan kar vidhansabha chunaav main vot denge, isliye yah jaruri he ki bache hue samay ko jaaya na kar behatar kaam kiya jaae
 Raghuvansh, a former MP from Vaishali region, said that the leader of the grand alliance will be selected by all the parties involved in the alliance
 yah poochne par ki maanjhi to nitish ko netaa bataate hai, rajd netaa ne kaha, 'jad (you) or maanjhi ke netaa to nitish kumaar hai hi, isamen bahes kii koi baat nahin he
 But as far as the leader of the Grand Alliance is concerned, it will be decided only after the meeting of the leaders of all the constituent parties
 'kendriya mantrimandal main bihar ke teen or saansadon ko shaamil kiye jane par raghuvansh ne kaha ki teenon saansadon ko rajyamantri banaaya gaya he
 This is an injustice with Bihar
 unhone kaha, 'bihar ke vikaas ke liye nahin, balki aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav ko dhyaan main rakhkar ek ranneeti ke tahat bihar ke teen or saansadon ko mantrimandal main sthaan diya gaya he
 Now to see what these ministers of Modi can do for him in Bihar
 'nitish kumaar akele hi jansampark yatra par nikle hai
 When asked about this subject, Raghuvansh said that there is no harm in it
 gathbandhan main shaamil sabhi dalon kaa alag-alag kaarykram hota he
 All the constituent parties will be strong, only then will the alliance be strong
 rajd bhi apana alag kaarykram kar rahaa he
 Significantly, in the last Lok Sabha election, four RJD candidates and two JD (U) candidates won

 maharashtra ke purv mukhyamantri ashok chavaan ke liye ek nai mushkil khadi ho gai he
 In a paid news case, the Election Commission has issued a show cause notice to Chavan asking him why he should not be disqualified for failing to disclose his election expenses as per law
 chavaan ko notice kaa jawaab dene ke liye 20 din kaa vakt dete hue ayog ne kaha ki vah 'janpratinidhitiv kanoon evam niyamon ke mutabik chunavi kharch ke hisaab kii jaankaree dene main naakaam rahe
 ' supreme court ke nirdeshon par chunaav ayog ne pichley may main chavaan ko ek notice jari kiya tha taaki vah 2009 ke maharashtra vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan apane kathith chunavi khacharen se jude maamle main ayog ke samaksh pesh hon
 The Commission considered those expenses to be a case of 'paid news'
 agar chavaan ko chunaav ayog dwaara ayogy ghoshit kar diya jaataa he to unki maujuuda loksabhaa sadsyta par asar pad saktaa he, jabaki yah maamla vidhansabha chunaavon main unke chunaav ladane se judaa hua he
 The order of the Election Commission states that a candidate who is disqualified by the Commission under Section 10 of the Representation of the People Act can contest for the next three years neither any House of Parliament nor State Legislature
 aadesh ke mutabik, aisa ummidavaar agar pehle se hi kisi sadan kaa sadsy he to vah chunaav ayog ke aadesh kii taarikh se us sadan kaa sadsy nahin rah sakegaa
 According to Para 70 of the Election Commission order, 'therefore, the resignation of the defendant from membership of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly on 22 May 2014 will not have any effect on the proceedings in the Commission and the proceedings will continue uninterrupted until a logical conclusion is reached
 ' The full bench of the commission consisting of Chief Election Commissioner VS Sampath, Election Commissioner HS Brahma and Election Commissioner SNA Zaidi issued the order of 104 pages
 peeth ne is mudde par 19 june ko apana faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 When contacted in this regard, former Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan said that he will respond to it after seeing the notice

 Modi said that the Congress leaders themselves believe that this is a party, not a party

 The importance of fasting: By observing fast on Mahashivaratri, all your sins are removed and the soul is purified
 aisi manyata he ki is din jahaan- jahaan bhi shivlinga sthapit he, waha bhagwaan shiv kaa aagaman avashya hota he
 If on the day of Mahashivaratri, a fast is observed with true devotion, then Lord Shiva will remove all your sufferings
 bataa den, mahashivaratri kaa vrath sabase prabhaavshaalee or laabhakaari vrath mana jaataa he
 During the fasting period, a hunter hunted animals and nurtured his family
 lekin ek din us shikari ko kisi bhi jaanavar kaa shikaar karne kaa mauka hi nahin mila
 Now because his family's stomach was filled with this, the hunter became very upset
 use dar sataane laga ki uske puure parivaar ko bhukhe pet sona padegaa
 By nightfall, the hunter got tired and went to the lake in the forest
 vahaan usne apni pyaas bujhaai or ek bel ke ped par jaakar baith gaya
 The hunter was very hopeful that now any animal would come near this lake
 shikari kii ummid par pani nahin phiraa
 Yes, a buck came there in a short time
 hirani ko dekh shikari kii khushi kaa thikaana naa tha
 He immediately took out his bow and agreed to strike
 lekin aisa karne ke chalate, ped ke kuch pattey neeche pade shivlinga par gir gaye
 Now the hunter was not aware that a Shivling was installed under that tree
 patton kii aawaaj sun hirani sachet ho gai or ghabaraate hue boli ' mujhe mat maaron '
 But the hunter was ignoring her because he had to satisfy his family's hunger
 ye sunakar hirani ne aashwaasan diya ki apane bacchon ko apane swaami ke paas chhodkar wo waapas aa jaaegi
 Hearing this, the hunter melted and let him go
 thodi der baat sarovar ke paas ek or hirani ai
 Seeing him, the hunter again took out his arrow command
 ped ko dhakka lagane ek chalate bel ke pattey shivlinga par gir gaye
 In this way, the second stroke of the hunter was also worshiped
 ab shikari ko dekh, hirani ne dayaa yachana kii or usase aagrah kiya ki usko naa maare
 But again the hunter rejected his mercy
 ye dekh hirani boli ' shikari, jo vyakti apane vachan kaa paalan nahin karata uske jivan ke sabhi punya nasht ho jate hai
 Have faith, i will definitely come back '
 ab shikari ne is hirani ko bhi jane diya
 Now after leaving the two deer, the hunter felt that today his family would sleep hungry
 lekin tabhi ek hiran aayaa
 As before, the hunter took his arrow and started aiming
 is prakriya main phir kuch belptr shivlinga par ja gire or uski tisare prahar kii puja bhi sampan ho gai
 This deer no longer petitioned the hunter for mercy, but said that it is his good fortune that he will be able to calm one's stomach hunger
 lekin usne kaha ki wo pehle apane bacchon ko unki maa ke paas chhod kar aayega
 The hunter believed the deer and let it go
 kuch samay baad shikari ne dekha kii sabhi hiran uski taraf bad rahen hai
 Seeing him, the hunter took out his bow and worshiped his fourth stroke
 ab kyonki uski shiv kii upasna purna ho gai thi, uskaa hday parivartan hua
 The hunter became self-assured that he hunts these unruly animals and nurtures his family
 usne sabhi hiranon ko waapas jane ko kah diya
 As soon as the hunter said this, the divine form of Lord Shiva appeared and he blessed the hunter with fame, splendor and fame
 to is kahani kaa saar yaheen he ki agar aap sachche dil se shiv kii upasna karte hai to bhole baba aapke sabhi dukhon kaa haran karte hai or apni kripadrushti sadaiv banaakar rakhte hai

 On the matter of the removal of Article 370, former IAS officer and Jammu and Kashmir People's Movement (JKPM) President Shah Faisal says that fear is spreading in Kashmir

 " Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh's favorite political idiom is to prepare populist schemes
 2008 main do ru
 Raman Singh, who returned to power by selling kilos of rice, is in the process of reaping the political crop of 2013 by giving a cheaper house this time
 vaise, makaan or chaaval ke alaava bhi jivan se lekar mrityu tak raman sarkaar ke paas 21 pramukh yojanaayen hai
 While Raman Singh seems to be panicking his plans, the opposition considers him nothing more than a bust of fire
 june main raman singh ne apane nirvachan kshetra rajanandgaanv main 11,800 karod ru
 Laid the foundation stone of the housing scheme named 'atal Vihar'
 iske tahat raipur se lekar sukama tak ek lakh makaan banaae jaaenge
 The Chief Minister claims that this will be the first of its kind scheme in the country, with the construction of houses in towns, block headquarters and villages with a population of more than 5,000
 inamen 85 fisadi makaan garibon ke liye honge
 He says, "to raise the standard of living of the poor, now we are going to provide housing after food grains
 ''2008 main apni sasta chaaval yojana ke bal par hi raman singh 'chaaval vaale baba' ke naam se prasidgh hue the or dobaaraa satta main aae the
 On 15 August last year, he announced nine new districts and in January this year, new districts were also formed

 In February, it announced an education loan to students at 4% interest
 nickshulk sanjivani ambulance seva sabhi jilon main shuru ho hi chuki he jisamen 108 dial karne par 20-25 minute main ambulance jane kaa daawa he
 However, it does not seem to be as effective in Naxal-affected areas
 ab tak sirf garibi rekha ke neeche ke logon ko hi kisi bhi aspataal main ek saal main 30,000 ru
 There was eligibility to get treatment till now, now the general category has also been included in the scheme by increasing its scope
 adivaasiyon ko paanch ru
 Plans per kilogram of gram, selling generic medicines to provide affordable medicines to the people and sending the body home at government expense after death are prominent
 raman sarkaar kii is chunavi ranneeti se congress bhi satark ho gai he or ise matadaataaon ko lubhaane kii koshish bataa rahi he
 Leader of the Opposition Ravindra Choubey says, "the government is making these announcements to get electoral gains
" isse garibon kaa koi phayda nahin hone vaala
 They allege that in 2006, the Center gave the state government Rs 300 crore to build 27,000 houses in Raipur
 die the lekin ve makaan aaj tak janata ko nahin mili
 Reversing this, Raman Singh says, "there should be no politics on schemes made for the poor
" khaali pet tarakkee kii baat nahin sochi jaati
 "in May, the State Congress launched a 'promise Keep' movement to pressure the state government to fulfill its promises
 pradesh congress ke media prabharee shailesh nitin trivedi kehete hai, ''2008 ko to chhod hi dijie, ab tak 2003 ke vaade bhi puure nahin hue
 The tribes have not yet received the Jersey cow
 berozegaron ko 500 ru
 The promise of giving a monthly allowance of Rs
 2,500 per quintal of paddy to the farmers, a job to one person from every tribal family is incomplete
 kaa bonus, paanch horsapavar ke sinchai pump ko muft bijli jaisi yojanaon ko puraa nahin kiya gaya
 The schemes are also putting a burden on the treasury of the government
 sasta chaaval yojana kaa is saal kaa bajet 950 karod ru
 Is, 255 crore per annum on exemption of electricity connection to farmers
 kaa bhaar aayega
 240 crore on the Atal Vihar Yojana as well

 Therefore light food is good for health

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator Call it the success of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav or the compulsion of the Congress-led central government that the economic package for which the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati would write a letter to the Center for 5 years during her tenure for the overall development of Uttar Pradesh
 The same economic package was achieved by Akhilesh within a few months of his reign
 espi ne kaha, akhilesh kii niyat saafasattarudh samaajawaadee party (sapa) kaa kahana he ki yah kamyaabi mukhyamantri akhilesh kii sooyeeboojh, behatar samanvay sthapit karne ke kaushal or saaf niyat kaa nateeja he
 He wants to develop Uttar Pradesh with honesty
 mayawati kii maang ansunimayawati ne saal 2007 main uttar pradesh kii satta par kabiz hote hi pradesh ke sarvangin vikaas ke liye kareeb 80 hajaar karod rupee kaa package centre se maanga tha
 Years went by, but the Center did not approve the package demand
 mayawati ne is dauraan kai reliyaan kin or centre kii tatkaaleen sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) sarkaar par sautela vyavhaar apanaae jane ke aarope lagaae
 In 2012, the SP government was formed in Uttar Pradesh
 akhilesh ne taiyaar kiya yojanaon kaa khaakabaspa pramukh kii hi tarah nae mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne bhi pradesh ke vikaas se judi tamaam yojanaon kaa praaroop taiyaar kiya or is baar unhone kareeb 90 hajaar karod rupee kaa akalan kar centre se package kii maang kii
 The central thing that shocked the UP was that the central government, which hanged Mayawati for five years, accepted the demand of Rs
 45 thousand crores of the Akhilesh government in a few months and assured further financial help
 vahiin, elahabaad main agle saal lagane vaale mahakumbh meley ke liye bhi 800 karod rupee ke vishesh aarthik package kii maang ko sweekaar kar liya gaya
 Opposing parties, seeing this achievement of Chief Minister Akhilesh with skepticism, called it a reward for sp's support of Congress candidate Pranab Mukherjee in the presidential election
 bijepi ne qaraar diya 'rishwat'bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke varisht netaa calraj mishra kehete hai, 'centre sarkaar ne akhilesh sarkaar dwaara maange gaye package par sahmati aise vakt par di thi jab desh main raashtrapati chunaav chal rahe the
 In such a situation, the message was that it is not a package, but a bribe for the purpose of securing votes for your favorite candidate
 'bispi ne congress ko bataaya 'dalit-virdohi'udhar, basapa ke rashtriya mahasachiv swami prasad maury ne kaha, 'basapa ke shasankaal main bahanji ne uttar pradesh ke sarvangin vikaas ke liye 80,000 karod rupee kii maang alag package ke rup main kii thi, lekin paanch saal ke dauraan congress ne ise ansuna kar diya
 After the formation of the SP government, the Congress gladly approved the acceptance of Rs 45,000 crore and proved that it is anti-dalit
 ' Nirmohi Akhara, Gopal Singh Visharad and Devkinandan Aggarwal argued that Ayodhya Ram's birthplace is mentioned in the scriptures
 faizabad ke gazetier main vivaadit parisar main ram ke janm sthaan kaa zikr he or faijabad ke revenue record main bhi 1861, 1893 or 1931 ke bandobast main vivaadit parisar ko janmasthan ke taur par darz kiya gaya he
 Both sides kept their documentary evidence true and the other's documents falsified
 nirmohi akhaada vivaadit zamin ko ram janm sthaan bataata rahaa
 He continued to claim that there was a temple here since Sanatan period, which was demolished and built a mosque in 1528
 vahiin sunni central vakf board kaa kahana tha ki jis jagah masjid banaai gai, vahaan koi mandir kabhi nahin rahaa
 The mosque was built on empty land
 lekin, yah sawaal abhi ansulajhaa tha ki mandir or masjid kaa jhagada shuru hone se pehle yah zamin kiski thi?ayodhya kii vivaadit zamin par ram mandir tha yaa nahin? yah jhagada sulajhane main rajasav vibhaag ke abhilekh ahm saboot ban sakate the
 But the screw was embroiled in the fact that the revenue records did not contain any details of the ownership of the disputed land
 nirmohi akhaada malikana haq ke bare main apni daleel pesh kar chukaa tha
 On the other hand, the Waqf Board said that Babur built the mosque on the land and now it is the property of Waqf
 aakhirkaar 26 july 2010 ko ayodhya kii vivaadit zamin ke malikana haq se jude sabhi mukademon main saboot, gavaah, jirah kaa daur khatm ho gaya
 But before that, the lives of those who laid the foundation of the cases on the disputed land of plot number 159 / 160 of Ramkot village in Ayodhya
 mukademon kii sunwaayee puri hone se pehle hi mohammad hashim ansaari ko chhodkar baaki saare muddai apni umr puri karke duniya se rukhsat ho chuke hai

 After this, Flower and Strauss went to meet Dhoni and Fletcher during the tea time and they said that their captain said that the decision would be upheld
 tendulkar ne iske baad dressing room main is maamle main hastkshep kiya or bel ko waapas bula diya gaya

 When Bell went to bat after tea, the England team came to the balcony to praise the Indians' decision, but by then they had come to know that it was Tendulkar for whom he was clapping

 Who rightfully thinks of protecting the country like Hollywood's Iron Man
 yahi nahin, uske paas hollywood ke aayran main jaisaa hi mattl suut bhi he, jisase wo bhartiya sena kii madad karnaa chahta he
 The man who made Iron Man's super suit is Shyam Chaurasia
 shyaam ko aayran main suut banane kaa ydia china or bharat ke bich chal rahe doklam vivaad ke dauraan aayaa tha
 The most special thing about his suit is that it has small cannon, including rocket launcher
 jise internet se bhi chalaaya ja saktaa he
 The body of this suit is made entirely of steel
 jise dushman kii goli bhed nahin sakati
 Its sensors can fire the enemy without any human help
 suut ke helmet, haath or pairon par bhi gan atech he
 Shyam told the news agency Sputnik that if the army modifies it, then the soldiers posted on the border will be able to use it
 iske alaava is suut ko un jagahon par bhi tainaat kiya ja saktaa he jahaan jawan nahin pahunch sakate hai
 a post shared by Team India (@indiancricketteam) on Oct 27, 2018 at 5:25 am PDT pashchim bengal main jari gatirodh ke dur hone ke asaar shanivaar raat najar aae jab andolan kar rahe doctoron ne kaha ki ve pradarshan khatm karne ke liye mukhyamantri mamata banerjee se baatcheet ko taiyaar hai lekin mulaakaat kii jagah ve baad main tay karenge
 Earlier in the evening, he turned down the proposal for a meeting with Banerjee at the state secretariat and instead asked him to come to the NRS Medical College Hospital for an open discussion on resolving the deadlock
 shanivaar der raat junior doctoron ke sanyukt forum ne samvaadadaata sammelan bulaayaa
 Forum spokesperson said that we are always ready for talks
 agar mukhyamantri ek haath badhayengi to ham hamaare 10 haath badhayenge
 
 ham is gatirodh ke khatm hone kii tatparta se pratiksha kar rahe hai
 The protesting doctors said they would wait for their organization's decision on the proposed venue for the meeting
 pashchim bengal main jari doctoron kii hadtaal ke bich siem mamata banerjee ne shanivaar kii shaam ko ek press conference kar doctoron se kaam par lautne kii apil kii
 He said that we are not using any kind of force
 sari maange maan lee he
 Doctors got wisdom
 unhone kaha ki kisi sanvaidhanik pad par baithe shaks se baatcheet karne ke liye sarkari daftar sabase behatar jagah he
 Let me tell you that this whole matter started when a family patient died of heart attack late on Monday this week, his family had beaten 2 junior doctors fiercely
 jisamen ye gambhir taur se ghayal ho gaye the
 After this, doctors in Kolkata went on strike from Tuesday, demanding an armed police force for security
 'bivi maange mor' ye jumala he desh main ban rahe us kanoon ke liye, jo agar lagu ho gaya, to kai sari pechidagiyaan bad jaaegin
 From marriage terms to divorce, all aspects will get complicated
 baat ho rahi he hindu marij act main sanshodhan kii, jis par cabinet bhi koi faisla nahin le saki
 That is, there is contradiction in the government regarding the new provision, so why is the government bent on this amendment
 sarkaar ke bich nahin ban rahi aam sahmatiis bahes kii shuruyaat to desh ke kanoon mantralay ne kiya tha, magar is par aam sahmati sarkaar ke bich hi nahin ban rahi
 The issue is the right of women after marriage breaks up
 desh ke kanoon mantri chaahate hai talaak ke baad mahilaon ko pati ke saath uski pushtaini jaaydaad main bhi hissaa mili
 But the contradiction continues in and out on this recommendation
 talaak ke baad patniyon ko pati ke pushtaini haq dilaane ke sawaal par cabinet kii baithak bulaai gai thi
 The Law Minister presented his stand in the meeting
 charchaa shuru hui to gulam nabi aaazaad, kapil sibbal, kamalnath yahaan tak ki krishna tirath jaise kai mantriyo ne iskaa virodh kiya
 Does not the family exist in danger? Chidambaram, despite the contradiction of the cabinet, may have told in a tone of tone
 lekin baat itani sahaj he nahin
 The Law Minister may be advocating for greater rights for women on the pretext of amending the Hindu Marriage Act, but many cabinet members fear that this provision will not endanger the family's existence
 cabinet ke mantriyo kii tarah kai tarah kii ashankaaye pradarshan kar rahe logon kii takhtiyon se bhi jaahir he
 In the eyes of Save the Family Foundation, which is opposing the amendment, the new law is going to harm wife and wife
 rajyasabha main atka bilhindu marriage act main sanshodhan ke masale par aapattiyaan iskaa khaakaa taiyaar karne ke baad se hi uth rahi hai
 Especially regarding the right of the wife to the husband's ancestral property
 ye bill haalanki loksabhaa main pichley saal hi paas ho chukaa he
 But this law got stuck in the middle debate in Rajya Sabha
 saansadon kii raay par rajyasabha ne ise standig cameti ko bhej diya
 Parliament's standing committee on the bill said that women should get a share in the husband's ancestral property
 pradhanmantri kii aguwai main cabinet kii baithak usee sifarish par vichaar karne ke liye bulaai gai thi
 But the general opinion could not be formed
 sanshodhan par cabinut kii baithak benatija khatm ho gai
 After the formation of Amarai, it has been sent to the gom
 maamle par do mantralay aamane-samnehindu marij act main prastaavit sanshodhan loksabhaa main paas ho chukaa he, lekin rajyasabha main atakane ke baad is par vichaar ke liye cabinet ke paas bheja gaya
 But there was no agreement here as well
 ab ye bill mantriyon ke samooh ke paas jayega
 Already, controversy has arisen regarding this
 vivaad he is kanoon ke banane ke baad shaadi or parivaar ke dhaanche ko hone vaale nuksaan ko lekar
 There are many issues of debate, but the answer to each question varies
 yahi asahmati bani bill ko lekar agar cabinet kii baithak benatija khatm hone kii vajah
 The Law Ministry argues that after divorce, the wife should get a share in the property acquired before the husband's marriage or marriage
 iske saath patni ko pati ke pushtaini jaaydaad main bhi hissaa milanaa chahie
 On this, the Ministry of Women and Child Development argues that the property which was purchased before marriage should be kept separate from the ancestral property of the husband
 prabhavit hoga parivaar kaa dhanchalekin sawaal sirf pushtaini jaaydaad kii paribhaasha kaa hi nahin, kai or pechidagiyon kaa bhi he
 The family structure will be affected firstly, while the issue of divorce is directly between the husband and wife
 jaankaron kii daleel he, ki pati-patni ke vivaad main agar pushtaini jaaydaad kai hisson main bantati he, to maa-baap jite ji apni property bacchon ke naam nahin karenge
 The second danger of the new provision is the increase in the incidence of divorce
 jaankaron kii najar main ab tak aapasi vivaad talaak kii vajah banate rahe hai, lekin nae kanoon ke baad puure jaaydaad main hissedari badi vajah ban sakati he
 Many such opinions are within the government itself
 ise lekar vipaksh ke tevar bhi samarthan main nahin dikh rahe
 According to them, the government is trying to divert people from the real issue through this law
 virodhiyon ko sarkaar kii manshaa par shakabil kaa virodh karne waalon ko daleel he, ki sarkaar kii manshaa agar saaf hoti, to wo talaak kii sharton ko or sakht kar sakati thi
 According to the circumstances, women could recommend increasing the amount of compensation
 hindu marij act main ab tak jo praavdhaan tha uske mutabik talaak ke baad patni ko pati sampatti main aadha hissaa miltaa he
 Apart from this, there is a provision of cash compensation for Gujar Basar
 isamen pushtaini jaaydaad ko jodakar koun sa samaadhaan nikaalnaa chaahati he sarkaar
 The law ministry that is advocating this bill also knows that there is a separate law on the right to ancestral property
 pita ke baad pushtaini jaaydaad par bete betiyon kaa hota he
 In such a situation, the participation of the daughters-in-law will add a new screw to the property war
 bill kaa aakhri masauda taiyaar karne se pehle sarkaar ko is pahalu ko bhi najar main rakhana hoga
 What is the Hindu Marriage Act? The Hindu Marriage Act was enacted to bind marriages to legal conditions
 ye baat aazaadee ke 8 saal baad 1955 kii he
 Since then, there have been many amendments to this act - but such a contradiction of the government has hardly come up
 is baar to sarkaar kii koshish kii aalochana har taraf ho rahi he
 Opposition and opposition social organizations are also opposing the government's intention
 hamaari parampara main kahawat to ye he ki shaadiyaan swarg me tay hoti hai
 Only 7 words of 7 rounds are enough to handle it
 lekin badalte jamaane kii ye sahajata kai pechidagiyon se bhar chuki he
 The Hindu Marriage Act was promulgated in the Constitution to avoid these complexities
 shaadiyon ko tuutane se bachaane or ise kanoonee sharton main baandhne ke liye 1955 main hindu marij act banaaya gaya
 But today, in the face of shattering relationships, the court also had to make the Act flexible
 agar kisi bhi shaadi ko bachaane kii koi gunjaaish nahin bachi ho, rishta todane par pati-patni donon sahamat hon, to 6 maheene kii ‘kooling period’ se pehle bhi talaak diya ja saktaa he
 The high court of the country had given this decision in a private case
 lekin ye faisla ishaara karata he, rishton kii ghutan se mukti paane kii chatapataahat vakt ke saath kitni badhati gai he
 Along with this, amendments have also been made in the Hindu Marriage Act
 masalan, mul kanoon main ladakon ke liye shaadi kii umr 18 saal or ladakiyon kii 15 saal thi, jise aage chalakar 21 saal or 18 saal kiya gaya
 Earlier, marriage by Hindu customs was considered valid, later legal registration was provided
 talaak kii sharton main bhi badlaav kiya jaataa rahaa
 After the divorce the wives were taken care of compensation
 lekin ab tak kisi bhi sanshodhan ko lekar khaas ho hallaa nahin hua
 But this time the provision is something else and the apprehensions about the law made after this are also big
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne shanivaar ko kaha ki kumbh meley ke aayojan main drishy or adrishy donon prakaar kii shaktiyaan upasthit rahati hai

 He said that though he was sure that the ball did not touch his bat

 Dravid said, my first thought was that i have not hit the ball
 lekin kaaphi tej aawaaj nikali thi or main yah pataa nahin kar paaya ki yah kahaan se nikali thi
 i knew that i had not hit the ground or pad or shoes, so i was confused as to where the sound came from
 mujhe nahin pataa tha ki balla mere juuton ke feete se laga he
 He said in an interview to the Daily Telegraph, so i asked my partner and he said that a loud voice came out
 isliye duniya ke sarvshereshth ampiron main se ek simon tuffel ne mujhe out qaraar diya
 My partner said that i am out and i have heard myself

 Dravid said that if he had asked for a referral, India would have been in a better position

 rajdhani dilli main loksabhaa chunaav se pehle aam aadmi party ne purna rajya kii maang tej kar di he
 Addressing a public meeting on Friday in Badarpur area of south Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that in 1947 the country was free and democracy came to India
 janatantr matlab janata kaa shashan jahaan janata vot daalati he or sarkaar chunati he
 That government works according to the public
 puure desh main janatantr aa gaya lekin dilli main nahin aayaa
 In Delhi, you vote and choose the government, but the power of government is nothing
 sari power centre sarkaar kii he
 Before 1947, all the power was with the British, today all the power belongs to the central government
 purna rajya kaa vaada puraa na karne par kejariwal ne piem modi or congress par bhi sawaal khadey kiye
 He said, for 70 years the people of Delhi have been saying that we need full statehood
 congress ne kaha ve purna rajya kaa darja denge lekin centre main bhi sarkaar hone par unhone purna rajya kaa darja nahin diya
 Modi ji himself came and told the people of Delhi that if they get seven seats, they will give full state status to Delhi but after becoming Prime Minister they forgot
 is loksabhaa chunaav main aap kaa mauka he
 During the public meeting, the Chief Minister was seen asking questions to the public
 unhone kaha, main poochna chahta hum dilli main gandagi kyon he, saafe safaai kyon nahin he jabaki dilli desh kii rajdhani he? dilli main safai nahin he kyonki MCD centre sarkaar ke under main he
 i want to tell the Prime Minister to control Pakistan, give the MCD to Delhi
 DDA dilli ke har aadmi ko ghar dene ke liye bani thi lekin didie dilliwaalon ke liye ghar nahin bana rahi balki builder se milakar aaj wo sirf bhrashtachar kaa adda ban chukaa he
 The DDA is also under the Prime Minister
 kejariwal ne kaha ki dilli main ceiling kyon ho rahi he? kyonki DDA ne puri dilli ke andar dukaane nahin banaain
 People are forced to live in raw colonies, because the DDA did not build houses
 wo bhi dilli ke logon ke under nahin aati balki modi sarkaar ke under main he
 Arvind Kejriwal told the people that like Haryana has a full government, like Punjab has a full government, Maharashtra has a full government, now the time has come that even after 70 years, the people of Delhi need their full government
 kejariwal purna rajya na hone par aane vaali samasya kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki unhone aaj kisi dilliwaale ke saath koi haadasa hota he, koi chori hoti he yaa mahilaon ke saath kuch galat hota he, to ve dilli police ke paas jate hai jo unki sunati nahin, wo vidhayak ke paas jate hai jiske under main police nahin aati to vah mukhyamantri ke paas jate hai jisaki police par koi power nahin
 Now the police comes under the Prime Minister, but can people meet the Prime Minister? Kejriwal said that if Delhi becomes a full state then women will get protection
 choriyaan dakaitiyaan kam hongi or agar dilli ko purna rajya banegaa to dilli chamkegi
 Arvind Kejriwal claimed that the day Delhi would become a full-fledged state, within 10 years, he would make every family a permanent home and also ensure all raw employees
 purv kendriya mantri mem pallam raju ne pradhanmantri narendra modi or bhartiya janata party (bijepi) par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that in 2014 PM Modi started with the talk of development, but now he does more of me and everything has become smaller for him
 lihaaja, desh bhar kii partiyaan chaahati hai ki ab desh kii janata ke saamne duusare vikalp ko rakhaa jaae
 Pallam Raju was attending India Today's Conclave South 2018 key session in Development and Identity - The Future of Voting
 pallam raju ne kaha ki 2008 main hamane 72 hajaar karod kaa kisaan karj maaf kiya tha
 This was not an election promise, but we tried to provide immediate relief to the farmers
 lekin maujuuda endie sarkaar main kisaan bebas hai
 No steps are being taken by the Modi government for them
 is satr ke dauraan bijepi pravaktaa krishna sagar raav ne kaha ki jab telugana main ovaisi kii party apane vot bank ko tiares main shift kara detii he to use secular kaha jaataa he or jab bijepi desh kii janata ke bich vot maangati he to vah communal ho jaati he
 The opposition has this dual attitude
 iskaa jawaab dete hue congress netri khushboo ne kaha ki bijepi beete kuch varshon se rahul gandhi se pareshaan he
 BJP is watching and criticizing Rahul's every move
 bijepi ko zyada matlab he ki rahul kya khate hai, kya pahante hai, kis mandir main jate hai or unki jati kya he
 He said that we know our mistakes and we are not hesitant to accept it
 tamilnadu main diemke ke saath hamaara majboot gathbandhan he
 The iron man of the Bharatiya Janata Party has melted
 laal krishna adwani istifawapas lene par raji ho gaye hai
 Now the question is of his role
 bijepi ne to apni raah chun lee he
 The party is beginning to see its leader in Modi
 aise main ab party ke liye kya karenge adwani? kya wo piem pad kaa moh chhod maardarshak kii bhoomika nibhaayenge?jis kadar adwani ke naram padane kii khabar ai he usase bhi kai sawaal uthe hai? kya unhen sachmuch party kii chhavi kii chintaa hone lagi thi? yaa phir wo samaj gaye the ki sangh ke dabaav ke baad modi par party ke liye you turn ab mumkin nahin? yaa phir unhen siyasat main gumnaam hone kaa dar sataane laga tha? yaa phir party or adwani ke bich kuch or bich kaa rasta nikal aayaa, jisamen pad or sammaan dono kii gunjaaish ho
 Signs of Advani's softening started to be found in the afternoon
 party netaaon kaa utsaah bataa rahaa tha ki ab sab thik ho jayega
 At 11 am on Monday, Advani sent out his resignation from all the posts of the party and stirred up BJP
 istipha milte hi party adhyaksh samet tamaam kaddavar chehron kaa adwani kii choukhat par hajri lagane kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya tha
 All the leaders were seen trying to express the pain of the party being devoid of Advani
 ek taraf maan-manouvval ho rahi thi or duusari taraf party apane faisle se samjhaute ko taiyaar nahin thi
 Under the pressure of the Sangh, the scope of U-turn on Modi's issue was over
 party adhyaksh ne bhi saaf kar diya tha ki modi ko to khud adwani ne aashirwad diya he, or unhen chunaav samiti kii kaman sabaki sahmati se saunpa gaya he phir is faisle par waapas jane kii gunjaaish kahaan
 On the other hand, Modi, who became the center of Advani's displeasure, was busy with his work
 unhone adwani ko manaane kii aupchaarikta somvaar ko phone par kar lee thi
 He remained engaged in his national agenda while addressing the farmers' gathering on Tuesday
 vahaan jab adwani se jude sawaal bhi daage gaye to unhone ansuna kar diya
 Perhaps all these signals from the party were enough to convince Advani that now the political era of BJP is changing
 grandmaster vishvanathan anand ne kaha ki isi maheene apana chauthaa vishwa shatranj championships khitaab jitkar unhone apane aalochakon ko galat sabit kar diya jo un par ‘killer instinct’ kii kami kaa aarope lagaate hai
 Anand retained his world title by defeating local Veslin Topalov recently in Sofia, Bulgaria
 unhone yahaan samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘aam taur par log mujh par aarope lagaate hai ki main nervas ho jaataa hum yaa mujhamen killer instinct kii kami he
 i defended my third consecutive title and it was special
 ’’ anand ne kaha ki topalov ke khilaaf unka match vishwa championships ke sabase mushkil maichon main se tha or unka bulgaria kaa virdohi bhi kaaphi pratispardhi he
 He said, "it was my toughest match
 prayek match kaaphi kadaa tha
 Most of the time our match did not end in less than four hours
 yah kaaphi tanaavpurn tha
 "this Indian veteran said," i knew that he would not offer a draw (in the 12th round)
 pehali baar hamane match main ek duusare se baat nahin kii
 He spoke to me at the end of the match
 ’’apane naveenatam khitaab kii tulana pichley teen khitaab se karte hue anand ne kaha, ‘‘yah shatranj ke board or iske baahar sabase mushkil tha
 Normally, i would guess that the bet would go on like this
 pichhali championshipon main aisa hi hota tha or achaanak kii main badi badhat bana letaa tha
 But this match was very close
 is tarah se yah pratiyogita meri ab tak kii sabase kadi pariksha thi
 Anand, however, did many things for the first time during this title
 vah iceland ke jwalamukhi se nikle raakh ke gubaar ke kaaran pehali baar championships ke liye bas se gayi
 It was the first match after 1921 in which neither of the two players belonged to the Soviet Union
 is bhartiya diggaj ne kaha ki pratiyogita ke dauraan gairi casparove or vladimir craimanik ke samarthan se unka manobal badha
 He said, "many difficult moments came during the match, many stressful moments and if you suddenly get a call from Gary or Kramnik, it definitely boosts your morale
 pehali baar mujhe is tarah kii madad mili
 Regarding Russian dominance in the World Championship title, Anand said, "I can say that his dominance is not the same now
" mujhe shaq he ki koi desh soviet sangh kii tarah dabadabaa bana paaegaa

 Rahul Gandhi gave his support to Gurmehar by tweeting
 rahul ne kaha ki bhay or atyaachaar ke khilaaf ham apane chaatro ke saath khadey hai
 There will be Gurmehar Kaur in every voice raised against intolerance and injustice
 naidu ne kaha- chaatro ko bhadakaayaa ja rahaavhin is puure vivaad par kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu ne kaha ki algaavvaad kaa samarthan koi kaise kar saktaa he? jammu-kashmir kii aazaadee ke naare kaise lagane die ja sakate hai
 Those who imposed emergency, those who censored the media and those who tried to reduce the power of the Supreme Court, are teaching us
 campason main jaakar raajnneeti kii ja rahi he or chaatro ko bhadakaayaa ja rahaa he, yah bardaasht nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Hurting the feelings of others does not include freedom of expression
 asahmati kaa swaagat he lekin algaavvaad ko bardaasht nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Why Gurmehar came in the discussion? Actually, Gurmehar Kaur has been on social media for the last four days

 Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kamal Nath specifically targeted the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), saying it does not want the bill to be passed, while other opposition parties have no objection to the bill
 kamalnath ne kaha, 'bijepi ek ore kahati he ki vah bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak or khaadya suraksha vidheyak par charchaa karnaa chaahati he, kyonki ve aitihaasik vidheyak hai
 On the other hand she disrupts the proceedings of the House
 'unhone kaha, 'anya raajnneetik partiyaan vidheyak par bahes karnaa chaahati hai or ise paarit karnaa chaahati hai
 Only BJP is causing trouble
 yah bahut durbhagyapurna he ki bijepi sadan main vah baat nahin kah rahi he, jo vah sadan ke baahar kah rahi he
 Whatever she said in the TV studio, she could have said it in the House, which the government could answer
 'kendriya soochna evam prasaaran mantri manish tiwari ne pehle kaha tha ki vipaksh kaa khaas varg khaadya suraksha vidheyak ko lataka kar bhukh kii jagah bhukhon ko hi mitaanaa chahta he

 The American newspaper has also criticized Pakistan's stance
 akhbaar ne likhaa he ki pakistan lambey samay tak bharat ke sanyam ko halke main nahin le saktaa
 The newspaper writes that if Pakistan rejects Prime Minister Narendra Modi's offer of cooperation, it will become an 'untouchable country' for the whole world
 
 
 
 The action of PM Modi will be correct, American newspaper Wall Street Journal wrote that Modi is currently exercising restraint, but Pakistan cannot continue to rely on it
 agar modi ke sahyog ke prastaav ko khaarij kiya jaataa he to duniya ke liye pehle se achhut pakistan, ab or achhut desh ban jayega
 The newspaper wrote warning that PM Modi's action would be justified if the Pakistan Army continues to send arms and terrorists from across the border to India

 Oliver and his friend were returning from a friend's house in Kishangarh area of vasant Kunj
 auto rickshaw pahunchaa to oliver se pehle teen log usamen baith gaye
 After that there was an argument and a quarrel erupted
 oliver ne bhaagane kii koshish kii to teenon logon ne 20-25 meter tak uskaa peechha kiya or use pattharon se bhi maaraa
 When the locals came to help, they killed them too
 is bich oliver ke dost ne hallaa kiya or aasapaas rahane vaale anya africa mul ke logon ko bulaayaa
 But the accused escaped from the scene
 sthaneey logon ne police ko bulaayaa jiske baad oliver ko ames ke troma centre le jaaya gaya lekin use bachaaya nahin ja sakaa
 Oliver came to India on a student visa in 2012 and was teaching French at an institution
 congou ke saadhaaran parivaar kaa ladkaa tha, itnaa saadhaaran ki maa baap ke paas paise nahin hai ki apane bete ke shav ko apane vatan le jaaen

 The Government of India has taken all these incidents very seriously

 The police officers held a meeting with the villagers and heard and understood the views of both sides
 yah bhi dekha gaya ki kuch maamalon main africa nagarikon kii bhi galati thi
 Talk with a minor argument reached a quarrel
 gaanvon waalon ne jo shikaayat kii usase pataa chalaa ki unhen africa nagarikon kii jivan style se kaaphi aitaraaz he
 Listening to music till late at night
 party karnaa or jaagnaa
 Complaints about culture and behavior have not just been from African citizens, the local people of villages in South Delhi have the same complaints from the tenants of the Northeast
 dakshin dilli ke muniraka main kareeb 4000 purvottar ke kiraayedaar rahete hai
 Often a collision occurs with them
 gaanv waalon ko lagata he ki aisa jab bhi hota he police yaa media unki nahin sunata he isliye logon ne apane paise se muniraka main kareeb 200 sisitivi camere laga rakhe hai
 We spoke to Bhagwan Dev, President of Resident Welfare Association
 unhone kaha ki ye log ek kamare main aath das log rahete hai isliye hamen kiraaya zyaada miltaa he
 Many people are quite good
 lekin jab der raat tak hangaamaa karte hai, tej sangeet bajaate hai or kai baar sharaab ke nashe main hangaamaa karte milte hai to ham samaj nahin pate ki inke aapas ke maamle main ham kaise hastkshep karen
 In a panchayat held in Munirka two years ago, Lord Dev had clearly said that we should not call anyone Chinki, Nepali or Madrasi
 ye sabhi bharat ke naagarik hai
 We have tenants from whom our expenses are incurred but there are some anti-social elements that have to be tracked
 bhagwaan dev kii yah pahal to kaaphi thik he ki muniraka main koi inhen chinki nepali yaa dakshin ke kiraayedaaron ko madrasi nahin kahegaa
 Shekhar Tokas is a local citizen
 unka kahana he ki samvaad bad rahaa he
 We also hold a meeting of JNU professor here
 hazaron parche baant chuke hai
 It is also a better way that people from both cultures get to know each other
 samasya tab he ki jab ek samskruti nai samskruti par daavedaari kare
 It is good that both give equal space
 baat africa se judi he lekin purvottar kii ghatnaon kaa zikr isliye kiya kyonki donon ek duusare se jude hue hai
 If we add these issues only with color then it will not be right

 Nido Tanya was killed in Lajpat Nagar in 2014
 tab kaaphi hangaamaa hua tha

 videshi nagarikon ke liye bhi bani
 The Delhi Police was asked to construct the North East Cell, whose office is in Nanakpura
 vartmaan main rahin hibu iske joint seepi hai
 But it is not that these events have not reduced the distance between Munirka and Northeast
 is gaanv ke logon kaa kamaal kahie ki kuch baton ko lekar shikaayat to he magar unhone muniraka ke bheetar puraa kaa puraa manipur yaa kahen to purvottar bharat basane diya he
 Every other shop from Anupam Restaurant to Babulal Chowk now belongs to the people of the Northeast
 kiraaye kii dukaan he magar dukandaar vahi hai
 There were many incidents of confrontation around Babulal Chowk
 ab aap in dukaanon main purvottar se judaa kuch bhi kharid sakate hai
 Clothes, shoes, spices, parlors are all here
 unheen kapadon kii dukaane hai jinke pahanane se sthaneey logon ko apni samskruti khatre main nazar aati he
 There are also North East travel shops
 aap yahaan vahaan ke khaane se lekar yahaan se vahaan jane ke saare intazaam kar sakate hai
 Many times we do not see these relationships which have a lot of potential
 dilli police ne africa ke nagarikon se bhi baat kii ki sthaneey nagarikon kii samskruti kaa sammaan karen
 Doesn't music play till late night in our religious and wedding functions? tab ham apane kisi deshi videshi padosi kaa khyaal rakhte hai
 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Home Minister Rajnath Singh have taken these incidents with African citizens very seriously
 videsh rajya mantri ve ke singh ne twit kar kaha he ki, 'dilli police ke saath charchaa kii he
 We found the media calling a small quarrel an attack on Africans
 media aisa kyon kar rahaa he
 As a responsible citizen, we should ask questions to the media
 ' Broadcasters Association president NK Singh has strongly objected to VK Singh
 unka kahana he ki aisi choti ghatnaayen bhi badi ho jaati hai
 It is better that we take every incident seriously
 ve ke singh bhul gaye ki jab congou ke noujvaan kii maut hui thi tab us ghatana se naaraaz africa rajdooton ne bharat africa maitri kaarykram main jane se manaa kar diya tha
 Later everything became normal and this program took place
 isaki pratikriya congou main bhi hui
 On 26 May, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Vikas Swaroop said that some Indian shops in Congo have been attacked and some Indians have also been injured by gunfire
 ho saktaa he ki ye ghatana dilli main congou ke chaatr kii hatya kii pratikriya main hui ho
 The Indians were asked to close shops there
 ab maamla shant he
 The comments behatar he ki ham in ghatnaon ko maamuli na maane
 It is also true that there is a slight rumor, but it has to be understood that the words of violence from caste to caste are not wrong
 bharat ke raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne bhi in ghatnaon par bayaan jari kiya he
 Pranab Mukherjee said, 'we have close relations with African countries
 mahatma gandhi ne satyagrah kaa prayog pehle africa kii zamin par hi kiya jisane hamaare desh ko badla
 So how can we cope with this? ham aisa soch bhi kaise sakate hai
 Should African people not feel safe in India
 mujhe khushi he ki bharat sarkaar ne turant kadam uthaae
 i welcome the initiative of the Ministry of External Affairs in association with the Ministry of Home Affairs
 ' Just before midnight of Friday, 20 May, when Masonda Kentanda Oliver was going to be 24 years old, some people were told to fix autorickshaw in the area of vasant Kunj
 oliver or uskaa dost vasant kunj ke kishangarh ilaake main ek dost ke ghar se laut rahe the
 When the auto rickshaw arrived, three people sat in it before Oliver
 uske baad bahes hui or bahes se jhagada shuru ho gaya
 When Oliver tried to escape, the three men followed him for 20-25 meters and hit him with stones
 jab sthaneey log madad ko aae to unhone unhen bhi maaraa
 Meanwhile, Oliver's friend made a ruckus and called people of other African descent living nearby
 lekin aaropee maukey se bhaag nikle
 The locals called the police after which Oliver was taken to the Trauma Center in AIIMS but could not be saved
 oliver 2012 main chaatr visa par bharat aayaa tha or ek santhaan main french padhaa rahaa tha
 The boy from the Congo's ordinary family was so simple that the parents do not have the money to take the body of their son to their homeland
 bharat sarkaar ne kaha he ki olivir ke shav ko uske ghar tak le jane kaa sara bandobast kiya ja rahaa he
 Oliver's friend said that he had been given racist abuses
 is ghatana ke prakaash main aate hi videsh mantri sushma swaraj ne apane str par turant sakriyata dikhaai
 Talked to the Home Minister, Deputy Governor of Delhi
 police ne mobin azaad naam ke yuvak ko giraftaar bhi kiya he
 Mobin Azad's two companions Mukesh and Prakash are absconding
 iske baad dakshin dilli ke raajpur khurd or maidan gadhi se bhi kuch ghatnaon kii khabar mili he
 Police says this is not racial violence
 bharat sarkaar ne in sabhi ghatnaon ko kaaphi gambhirtha se liya he
 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj also sent Minister of State for External Affairs VK Singh and Secretary Amar Sinha on Sunday
 police adhikariyon ne gaanv waalon ke saath baithak kii or donon pakshon kii baat ko suna or samajha
 It was also seen that African citizens were also at fault in some cases
 maamuli kahasuni se baat jhagade tak par pahunch gai
 The complaint by the villagers showed that they had a lot of objection to the lifestyle of African citizens
 der raat tak sangeet sunanaa
 Partying and waking up
 samskruti or vyavhaar ko lekar shikaayat sirf africa nagarikon se nahin rahi he, dakshin dilli ke gaanvon ke sthaneey logon kii purvottar ke kiraayedaaron se bhi yahi shikaayatein hai
 Around 4000 Northeast tenants live in Munirka in South Delhi
 aksar inke saath takaraav kii ghatana ho jaati he
 The villagers feel that whenever this happens the police or media does not listen to them, so people have installed about 200 CCTV cameras in Munirka with their money
 hamane resident welfare association ke adhyaksh bhagwaan dev se baat kii
 He said that these people live eight to ten people in a room, so we get more rent
 bahut se log kaaphi achche hai
 But when we are up late in the night, playing loud music and many times getting drunk, then we do not understand how to interfere in their mutual affairs
 bhagwaan dev ne do saal pehle muniraka main hui ek panchayat main saaf saaf kaha tha ki ham logon ko kisi ko bhi chinki, nepali yaa madrasi nahin kahana chahie
 They are all citizens of India
 hamaare kiraayedaar hai jinase hamaara kharchaa chalata he lekin kuch asamaajik tatv hai un par nazar rakhni hogi
 This initiative of Lord Dev is quite right that no one in Munirka would call them Chinki Nepali or the tenants of the south as Madrasi
 shekhar tokes ek sthaneey naagarik hai
 He says that the dialogue is growing
 ham log bhi jeenyu ke professor kii yahaan sabha karaate hai
 Thousands of leaflets have been distributed
 yah bhi ek behatar tarika he ki donon samskritiyon ke log ek duusare ko jaane
 The problem is when a culture claims a new culture
 acha ho ki donon baraabar jagah den
 The matter is related to Africa but referred to events in the Northeast because the two are related to each other
 agar ham sirf rang se in masalon ko jod denge to sahi nahin rahegaa
 The North East Cell Facebook page of the Delhi Police has thirty five thousand likes
 2014 main lajpat nagar main nido tanya kii hatya ho gai thi
 There was a lot of uproar then
 adaalat ke aadesh se north east ke logon ke liye ek helpline 1093 bani
 Made for foreign nationals as well
 dilli police ko north east cell banane ke liye kaha gaya jiskaa daftar nanakpura main he
 Currently Rahin Hibu is its joint CP
 lekin aisa nahin he ki in ghatnaon se muniraka or purvottar ke bich kii duuri kam nahin hui he
 Tell the people of this village that there are complaints about some things, but they have let the whole of Manipur or, say, northeast India settle within Munirka
 anupam restraan se lekar babulal chowk kii har duusari dukaan ab purvottar ke logon kii he
 There is a rental shop but the shopkeepers are the same
 babulal chowk ke aas paas hi kai baar takaraav kii ghatana ho jaati thi
 Now you can buy anything connected to the Northeast in these shops
 kapade, juute, masaale, parlor sab hai yahaan
 These are the same clothing shops whose wear makes the local people see their culture in danger
 north east travel kii dukaane bhi hai
 You can make all arrangements from here to dinner and from here to there
 kai baar ham in rishton ko nahin dekh pate hai jinamein kaaphi sambhaavna rahati he
 Delhi Police also spoke to African citizens to respect the culture of local citizens
 kya hamaare dharmik or shaadi byaah ke aayojanon main der raat tak music nahin bajataa he
 Then we take care of any of our native foreign neighbors
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj or grahamantri rajnath singh ne africa nagarikon ke saath ho rahi in ghatnaon ko kaaphi gambhirtha se liya he
 Minister of State for External Affairs VK Singh has said in a tweet that, 'discussed with Delhi Police
 hamane paaya ki media ek chote se jhagade ko africa logon par hamale kaa naam de rahaa he
 Why is the media doing this? ek jimmedaar naagarik ke naate hamen media se sawaal poochna chahie
 ' broadcasters association ke adhyaksh enke singh ne ve ke singh kii baat par sakht etraz jataayaa he
 They say that even such small incidents become big
 behatar hai ki ham har ghatana ko gambhirtha se len
 VK Singh forgot that when the Congo youth was killed, angry African ambassadors refused to attend the India Africa Friendship Program
 baad main sab saamaanya ho gaya or ye kaarykram hua
 It also reacted in Congo
 26 may ko videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa vikaas swaroop ne bataaya ki congou main kuch bharatiyon kii dukaanon par hamale hue hai or kuch bhartiya bandook kii goli se ghayal bhi hue hai
 The incident may have occurred in response to the murder of a Congo student in Delhi
 vahaan par bharatiyon se dukaane band karne ke liye kah diya gaya
 Now the case is cool
 tippaniyan It is better that we do not consider these incidents as minor
 yah bhi sahi he ki maamuli kahasuni hoti rahati he lekin yah samajhnaa hoga ki jati se lekar nasl ke naam par hinsa kii baaten galat nahin hai
 President of India Pranab Mukherjee has also issued a statement on these incidents
 pranab mukherjee ne kaha, 'africa deshon ke saath hamaare qareebi sambandh rahe hai
 Mahatma Gandhi first used Satyagraha on the land of Africa which changed our country
 isliye ham kaise ise sahan kar sakate hai
 How can we even think like that? kya africa logon ko bharat main surakshit mahasoos nahin karnaa chahie
 i am glad that the Government of India took immediate steps
 main grih mantralay ke saath milakar kii gai videsh mantralay kii pahal kaa swaagat karata hum
 ' oliver ke mitra ne kaha ki use naslbhedi gaaliyaan di gai hai
 Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj showed immediate activism at her level as soon as this incident came to light
 dilli ke up rajyapal, grahamantri se baat kii
 Police has also arrested a youth named Mobin Azad
 mobin azaad ke do saathi mukesh or prakaash faraar hai
 After this, some incidents have also been reported from Rajpur Khurd and Maidan Garhi in South Delhi
 police kahati he ye nasli hinsa nahin he
 The Government of India has taken all these incidents very seriously
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne ravivaar ko videsh rajya mantri ve ke singh or sachiv amar sinha ko bhi maukey par bheja
 The police officers held a meeting with the villagers and heard and understood the views of both sides
 yah bhi dekha gaya ki kuch maamalon main africa nagarikon kii bhi galati thi
 Talk with a minor argument reached a quarrel
 gaanvon waalon ne jo shikaayat kii usase pataa chalaa ki unhen africa nagarikon kii jivan style se kaaphi aitaraaz he
 Listening to music till late at night
 party karnaa or jaagnaa
 Complaints about culture and behavior have not just been from African citizens, the local people of villages in South Delhi have the same complaints from the tenants of the Northeast
 dakshin dilli ke muniraka main kareeb 4000 purvottar ke kiraayedaar rahete hai
 Often a collision occurs with them
 gaanv waalon ko lagata he ki aisa jab bhi hota he police yaa media unki nahin sunata he isliye logon ne apane paise se muniraka main kareeb 200 sisitivi camere laga rakhe hai
 We spoke to Bhagwan Dev, President of Resident Welfare Association
 unhone kaha ki ye log ek kamare main aath das log rahete hai isliye hamen kiraaya zyaada miltaa he
 Many people are quite good
 lekin jab der raat tak hangaamaa karte hai, tej sangeet bajaate hai or kai baar sharaab ke nashe main hangaamaa karte milte hai to ham samaj nahin pate ki inke aapas ke maamle main ham kaise hastkshep karen
 In a panchayat held in Munirka two years ago, Lord Dev had clearly said that we should not call anyone Chinki, Nepali or Madrasi
 ye sabhi bharat ke naagarik hai
 We have tenants from whom our expenses are incurred but there are some anti-social elements that have to be tracked
 bhagwaan dev kii yah pahal to kaaphi thik he ki muniraka main koi inhen chinki nepali yaa dakshin ke kiraayedaaron ko madrasi nahin kahegaa
 Shekhar Tokas is a local citizen
 unka kahana he ki samvaad bad rahaa he
 We also hold a meeting of JNU professor here
 hazaron parche baant chuke hai
 It is also a better way that people from both cultures get to know each other
 samasya tab he ki jab ek samskruti nai samskruti par daavedaari kare
 It is good that both give equal space
 baat africa se judi he lekin purvottar kii ghatnaon kaa zikr isliye kiya kyonki donon ek duusare se jude hue hai
 If we add these issues only with color then it will not be right
 dilli police kii north east cell ke fasebuk pej par pantis hazaar likes hai
 Nido Tanya was killed in Lajpat Nagar in 2014
 tab kaaphi hangaamaa hua tha
 a court order created a helpline 1093 for the people of the North East
 videshi nagarikon ke liye bhi bani
 The Delhi Police was asked to construct the North East Cell, whose office is in Nanakpura
 vartmaan main rahin hibu iske joint seepi hai
 But it is not that these events have not reduced the distance between Munirka and Northeast
 is gaanv ke logon kaa kamaal kahie ki kuch baton ko lekar shikaayat to he magar unhone muniraka ke bheetar puraa kaa puraa manipur yaa kahen to purvottar bharat basane diya he
 Every other shop from Anupam Restaurant to Babulal Chowk now belongs to the people of the Northeast
 kiraaye kii dukaan he magar dukandaar vahi hai
 There were many incidents of confrontation around Babulal Chowk
 ab aap in dukaanon main purvottar se judaa kuch bhi kharid sakate hai
 Clothes, shoes, spices, parlors are all here
 unheen kapadon kii dukaane hai jinke pahanane se sthaneey logon ko apni samskruti khatre main nazar aati he
 There are also North East travel shops
 aap yahaan vahaan ke khaane se lekar yahaan se vahaan jane ke saare intazaam kar sakate hai
 Many times we do not see these relationships which have a lot of potential
 dilli police ne africa ke nagarikon se bhi baat kii ki sthaneey nagarikon kii samskruti kaa sammaan karen
 Doesn't music play till late night in our religious and wedding functions? tab ham apane kisi deshi videshi padosi kaa khyaal rakhte hai
 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Home Minister Rajnath Singh have taken these incidents with African citizens very seriously
 videsh rajya mantri ve ke singh ne twit kar kaha he ki, 'dilli police ke saath charchaa kii he
 We found the media calling a small quarrel an attack on Africans
 media aisa kyon kar rahaa he
 As a responsible citizen, we should ask questions to the media
 ' Broadcasters Association president NK Singh has strongly objected to VK Singh
 unka kahana he ki aisi choti ghatnaayen bhi badi ho jaati hai

 ve ke singh bhul gaye ki jab congou ke noujvaan kii maut hui thi tab us ghatana se naaraaz africa rajdooton ne bharat africa maitri kaarykram main jane se manaa kar diya tha
 Later everything became normal and this program took place
 isaki pratikriya congou main bhi hui
 On 26 May, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Vikas Swaroop said that some Indian shops in Congo have been attacked and some Indians have also been injured by gunfire
 ho saktaa he ki ye ghatana dilli main congou ke chaatr kii hatya kii pratikriya main hui ho
 The Indians were asked to close shops there

 lekin ab jab aap jiro balance acount khulwaane kii sochen to bank ke niyam or sharton ko dhyaan se padh lijiega
 Not to do so, Lucknow's Dhirendra Srivastava was expensive
 lakhanu ke parivahan vibhaag main clerk kii naukari karne vaale dhirendra pratap shrivastav kii maa kaa dehanth 7 disambar ko ho gaya
 His mother lived in his village in Sultanpur
 maa ke kriyakarm ke liye paise nikaalane ke liye dhirendra kenra bank pahunche jahaan unki sailariacountmen aati thi
 The salary had come on one date and till now he had withdrawn only 10 thousand from the account for household expenses
 unke bank acount main kareeb dedh lakh rupee pade hue the
 So he was relaxed
 notebandi ke baavjood dhirendra ko bharosa tha kii maa ke dehanth hone kii vajah se unka bank unako kam se kam 14000 rupee to de hi degaa
 Dhirendra then got confused
 jababankne unka check lautaate hue kaha ki wo ab is maheene apane selary acount se ek rupaya bhi nahin niklaa sakate
 When asked the reason for this in Dhirendra, the bank told him that his account is Jan Dhan account
 yah baat vah maanane ko taiyaar nahin the, kyonki isi bank acount main har maheene 42,000 selary aati thi or 50, 000 hajaar se zyada rupee kii rakam vah kai baar nikaal chuke the
 Secondly, his account was eight years old when there was no Jan Dhan account
 hairaan pareshaan dhirendra ne offis main apane saathiyon ko ye baat bataai to pataa chalaa ki wo is musiibat ke maare akele nahin hai
 There were about two dozen people in his office, whose account was in Canara Bank, and everyone was giving the same reply to the bank that now they cannot withdraw more than ten thousand this month
 sab ke sab pareshaan kenra bank kaa chakkar laga rahe the
 If Dhirendra's mother had passed away, then Jyoti Awasthi, who works in his office, was upset that the installment of her home loan used to come out from this account
 parivahan vibhaag main hi kaam karne vaale girish ko kenra bank ke manager ne kaha ki agar das hajaar se zyada rupee nikaalane hai, to isi bank main ek doosraa acount khulawaao or apana paisa us acount main transfar kara lo
 When Aaj Tak talked to the bank's branch manager SK Srivastava about this, he opened a secret that even the troubled employees of the transport department were shocked
 manager kaa kahana tha saalon pehle kenra bank ne jandhan acount jaisi hi ek seva shuru kii thi, jisamen garib log jiro balance par acount khulavaa sakate the, lekin is acount main paisa jamaa karne or nikaalane ko lekar kuch sharten thi
 The name of this account was 'CAN SARAL'
 abhi tak to bank ne kabhi in sharton ko lagu nahin kiya or log jitna chaahe rupaya daal or nikaal rahe the, lekin notebandi ke baad achaanak bank ne in niyam sharton ko sakhti se lagu karnaa shuru kar diya or is acount par jandhan jaisi pabandi lagu kar di
 People are upset, but the bank says that now the only way is that these people can open their account and transfer their money to it, that is, it is expensive to open zero balance account

 He won 67 seats

 Rather, it also included stadiums and auteroims around the world

 Jimmy Jib Camera, modi-modi slogans, and spread of public opinion
 bihar main har raily main pradhanmantri ne kaha ki loksabhaa se bhi zyada bheed is baar dekh rahaa hum
 As far as i can see people are visible
 duusari taraf nitish kumaar or lalu yadav chunaav bhar safai dete rahe ki wo raily nahin kar rahe hai, sabha kar rahe hai
 The meetings of Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav were held in a native style
 manch saadhaaran hota tha or janata ke kareeb
 Due to being in a particular constituency of the assembly, the field was also filled with the people nearby
 bahut kam jagahon par badi sankhya main basen dikhin
 But in every meeting of Prime Minister Modi, the number of buses, Boleros and Scorpio was worth seeing
 zaahir he laae gaye log bhi honge taaki bheed se ye sandesh jaae ki janata bijepi ke saath he
 The rally in Samastipur was so crowded that i thought BJP or NDA would get 200 seats
 magar samastipur zile kii das main se ek bhi seat bijepi nahin jeet saki
 Take a picture of any gathering of the Prime Minister and see that they are close in camera close, but their stage was made so big and so far away from the public that the crowd that came to see them could not even see it with all their heart
 
 vaktaa or shrota main duuri bahut zyaada hone lagi
 Can't say with the claim whether this distance was in Lok Sabha or not
 lekin tab maahaul kuch alag hota tha
 Along with listening to Narendra Modi, there was also a passion to see

 Sarthak spent fifteen days in Samastipur and saw the rally of Nitish Kumar, Amit Shah and the Prime Minister and then went to a village nearby to assess its impact
 kya vaaki chunaav prabandhan se hi jeeta ja saktaa he
 Posters of Lalu Prasad were also seen in Patna
 puure patna main bijepi or nitish kumaar ke poster chaaye rahe
 Two posters of Lalu were seen near the Kotwali police station and the Income Tax intersection
 congress kaa to kahin nazar bhi nahin aayaa
 Not that it will not be felt, but whenever the poster showed either bjp's or Nitish Kumar's
 lalu yadav ne zarur twit karne waalon kii team bana lee thi magar unke voter smart phone vaale nahin the
 We sitting in Delhi have agreed that the voter is the one who has the smart phone
 agar chunaav prabandhan se hi jeeta ja saktaa he to lalu yadav ko kaise sabase adhik siten aa gayi
 Two dozen helicopters of BJP and its allies landed
 bijepi 53 siten hi jeet saki
 Lalu Yadav fought on the same helicopter on 101 and brought 80 seats
 nitish kumaar kii party jediu ko 71 siten mili hai
 It is true that Prashant Kishore's team made arrangements for Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar, but in terms of management, the BJP team was still heavy
 tippaniyan Social Media Social media is being done

 1 crore 59 lakh people follow Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Twitter
 lalu yadav ke foloar kii sankhya 1 lakh 61 hazaar he
 The number of followers of Nitish Kumar is 1 lakh 45 thousand
 sankhya ke maamle main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or unke sahyogi lalu yadav milakar bhi pradhanmantri se muqabla nahin kar sakate
 But both these leaders responded very well with their words, but also forced the BJP leaders to reply by tweeting first
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaavon ke samay maine dekha tha
 When Congress leaders made allegations in a rally, Narendra Modi would answer at the next rally the same day
 lekin is baar yahi ranneeti nitish kumaar ne apanaai
 There was no allegation from the Prime Minister that SMS of Nitish Kumar's press conference used to come
 lalu yadav kaa twit aa jaataa tha
 In real time, the two leaders were fighting the Prime Minister
 channelon par nitish kumaar or lalu yadav kaa twit bhi flash hone laga
 Did the Bihar election break the myth of election management, royal spending or create a new myth again
 ham aaj un patrakaron ke saath hai jo bihar chunaavon ko cover kar rahe the
 How did he see the voters changing between all these tricks
 kya unhen koi nayaa bihar nazar aa rahaa tha, jisaki jayakaar chunaavon ke baad ho rahi he
 Prime Minister Modi's rally became a symbol of success in the Lok Sabha elections
 jimi jib camera, modi-modi ke naare or jansailab kaa failaav
 In every rally in Bihar, the Prime Minister said that i am seeing more crowd than Lok Sabha this time
 jahaan tak nazar daudata hum log hi log nazar aa rahe hai
 On the other hand, Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav kept clarifying throughout the elections that they are not rallying, they are holding a meeting
 nitish kumaar or lalu yadav kii sabhaayen desi andaaz main hoti thim
 The stage was simple and close to the public
 vidhansabha ke kisi khaas kshetra main hone ke kaaran aasapaas ke logon se bhi maidan bhar jaataa tha
 a large number of buses were seen at very few places
 magar pradhanmantri modi kii har sabha main bas, bolero or scorpiyo kii taadaad dekhne laayak hoti thi
 Obviously, there will be people brought so that the message from the crowd goes that the people are with the BJP
 samastipur kii raily main itani bheed thi ki mujhe laga ki bijepi yaa endie ko 200 siten aaengi
 But BJP could not win any one of the ten seats in Samastipur district
 pradhanmantri kii kisi bhi sabha kii tasviir nikaal kar dekhiye wo camere ke chlose main nazadik to dikhte hai, magar unka manch itnaa bada banaaya jaataa tha or janata se itani dur hota tha ki unhen dekhne ke liye ai bheed ji bhar ke dekh bhi nahin paati thi
 The distance between the speaker and the listener started increasing
 daawey ke saath nahin kah saktaa ki yahi duuri loksabhaa ke samay hoti thi yaa nahin
 But then the atmosphere was different
 narendra modi ko sunne ke saath saath dekhne kaa junun bhi tha logon main

 Can elections really be won by management? patna main bhi lalu prasad ke poster ek do hi nazar aae
 Posters of BJP and Nitish Kumar were dominated all over Patna
 kotwali thana or iskar chauraahey ke paas lalu ke do hi poster nazar aae
 Congress was nowhere to be seen
 aisa nahin ki laga nahin hoga, magar jab bhi poster dikhaa yaa to bijepi kaa dikhaa yaa nitish kumaar kaa
 Lalu Yadav had formed a team of tweeters but his voters were not smart phones
 dilli main baithe baithe ham log maan chuke hai ki matadaata vahi he, jiske paas smart phone he
 If the election can be won only by the management, then how did Lalu Yadav get the most seats
 bijepi or uske sahyogiyon ke do darjan helicopter ude
 BJP could win only 53 seats
 lalu yadav ek hi helicopter se 101 par ladakar 80 siten le aae
 Nitish Kumar's party JDU has got 71 seats
 ye sahi he ki prashanth kishor kii team ne lalu yadav or nitish kumaar ke liye saajha prabandh kaa intjaam kiya, lekin prabandhan ke maamle main phir bhi bijepi kii team baari thi
 The comments soshal media soshal media kiya ja rahaa he

 The number of followers of Lalu Yadav is 1 lakh 61 thousand
 nitish kumaar ke foloar kii sankhya maatr 1 lakh 45 hazaar he
 In terms of numbers, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his colleague Lalu Yadav cannot compete with the Prime Minister
 magar in donon netaaon ne apni baton se khub jawaab diya, balki pehle twit kar bijepi ke netaaon ko jawaab dene ke liye majaboor bhi kiya

 congress ke netaa jis vakt kisi raily main aarope lagaate the, narendra modi usee din agali raily main jawaab de dete the
 But this time, Nitish Kumar adopted the same strategy
 pradhanmantri kii taraf se aarope aayaa nahin ki nitish kumaar ke press conferes kaa esemes aa jaataa tha
 Lalu Yadav's tweet used to come
 real time main donon netaa pradhanmantri se lard rahe the
 Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav's tweets also started flashing on the channels
