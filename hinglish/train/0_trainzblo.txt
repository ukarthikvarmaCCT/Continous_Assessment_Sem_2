 Let me tell you a story of Poonam Sharma
 july maheene main jab ghotaalaa saamne aayaa to punam sharma or kuch chaatr court gaye ki pariksha radd kar di jaae lekin faisle kaa intazaar hi karte rah gaye
 Meanwhile, even after the arrest of Jagdish Sagar, the government started the counseling process for admission
 chaatro se halafanama le liya ki bhavishya main doshi paae gaye to namakan radd mana jayega
 In October 2013, 135 suspected students were fired
 tab punam jaise kuch parikshaarthi maang karne lage ki unki jagah duusare chaatro kaa namakan hona chahie
 Poonam Sharma was not far from the rank at which admission was closed
 wo supreme court tak gai lekin tab tak namakan kii aakhri taarikh 30 sitambar biit chuki tha
 In December 2013, Poonam and some of the examinees also went on hunger strike
 kismat acchhee thi ki 2014 kii pravesh pariksha sibiesai ke eipamti se karai gai
 Poonam again became a doctor
 ek sipaahi kii beti or paanch bahanon main se ek punam zarur acha doctor banegi
 But who will listen to the stories of the children who were ruined
 aisa hi ghotaalaa 2010-11 main chhattisgarh main bhi khul chukaa tha
 You can also see the news published in Wednesday's Raipur Dainik Bhaskar
 bilaspur ke paas takhtpur kii ek dharmashala main bachche or unke matapita parchaa bhar rahe the
 According to Bhaskar, 13 lakhs were taken from every student for leaking the form and there was a loss of eight crores in one night
 vyaapman kii jaanch kar rahi team ab chhattisgarh main bhi haath paanv maar rahi he ki kahin uskaa sambandh vyaapman se to nahin tha
 It cannot be that the scam that was going on in Madhya Pradesh with political patronage was being done in Chhattisgarh by the grace of God
 agast 2013 main siaidi ko ek gupt chitthee mili ki chhattisgarh ke medical collejon main doctorl kii padhai kar rahe kai chaatr piemti main shaamil nahin hue the
 The names of the students were given in that letter and it was said that someone else had taken the exam instead
 siaidi ne jaanch kii to 2007 se 2010 ke bich 45 farji ummidavaar saamne aae
 Only 25 challans have been produced against them and the police have not been able to arrest one and a half dozen accused students
 donon hi sarkarein 2010-11 main shant raheen
 During this time such cases had also come up in Madhya Pradesh
 mukhyamantri raman singh ko bhi bataanaa chahie ki unhone kya kiya or unki police kis nattejey par pahunchi he
 Whose children were enrolled in Chhattisgarh? dainik bhaskar kii khabar main yah bhi he ki kuch chaatr zamaanat par reeha hokar waapas padhane to chale gaye lekin pichley paanch saat saalon main ek do saal kii padhai bhi puri nahin kar paae hai

 Look at these posters of Wattend in medical colleges of UP
 ye kathith rup se solver hai jinaki talash madhya pradesh kii estf kar rahi he
 Most of the nearly 200 solvers belong to up's medical college
 estf ko kanpur medical college ke 58 chaatro kii talash he jin par paise lekar duusare ke badale pariksha dene kaa andeh he
 Out of these 23 students were also arrested and released on bail and came to college
 kuch abhi bhi jail main hai or kuch faraar
 If he had passed, he would have become a doctor, but the trust of money and political power made him a criminal
 mainpuri se giraftaar ek solver ne madhya pradesh ko rajyapal ramanaresh yadav ke bete kaa naam liya tha jinaki sandigdh halaat main lakhanu main maut ho gai
 With this comes the question that when the NDA government was formed, some UPA governors were also removed for alleged corruption but how did Ramnaresh Yadav survive
 madhya pradesh hoicourt ne rajyapal ke khilaaf exiaar radd kar di he lekin jab aarope lage the tab bhi nahin hataae gaye
 For the past several days, it was being argued that Ujjain's Namrata committed suicide but now facts are coming out that the medical student Namrata Damor was killed
 namrata ke parivaar kaa intervyuu karne ke dauraan patrkaar akshay singh kii maut ho gai thi
 Namrata's role in Vyapam is not clear but his body was found on a railway track in Ujjain
 janvari 2012 kii postmart report kahati he uski maut VIOLENT ASPHYXIA yani dam ghontkar kii gai thi
 The question arises whether the police gave the statement without looking at the post mortem report
 kiske dabaav main aatmahatya qaraar diya gaya
 Namrata's brother says that there was pressure from the administration to compromise
 tippaniyan On Tuesday, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh wrote a letter to the Madhya Pradesh High Court asking the case to be handed over to the CBI but the Jabalpur High Court said that there are several petitions in the Supreme Court in this regard, so the decision is out of jurisdiction

 Today, there has been another progress in the pen drive case of whistle blower Prashant Pandey
 wheasal blor apni pen driev estf ko de di yah kah kar isamen asli saboot hai
 The STF reported to the SIT that the evidence in the pen drive is fake
 hoicourt ne esaiti kii report par kaha ki pratham drushtya ham sahamat hai
 Prashant Pandey went to Delhi High Court with a pen drive
 vahaan madhya pradesh sarkaar ne kaha ki pen driev farzi he or hamen zarurat nahin he
 The Delhi High Court gave the pen drive to the Jabalpur High Court
 do haftaa pehle jis pen driev ko estf ne khaarij kar diya tha waapas court se kaha ki hamen de di jaae
 The court sought an opinion from Amicus Curiae that has been submitted on Wednesday
 20 july ko jabalpur hai court is par apana faisla de sakati he
 Amicus Curiae reports in a sealed envelope
 khaas to nahin bataaya par unki baton se laga ki ve bina jaanch ke pen driev ko phenkane ke paksh main nahin hai
 So the government's claim on pen drive also seems to prove to be half incomplete

 aisa hi ghotaalaa 2010-11 main chhattisgarh main bhi khul chukaa tha
 You can also see the news published in Wednesday's Raipur Dainik Bhaskar
 bilaspur ke paas takhtpur kii ek dharmashala main bachche or unke matapita parchaa bhar rahe the
 According to Bhaskar, 13 lakhs were taken from every student for leaking the form and there was a loss of eight crores in one night
 vyaapman kii jaanch kar rahi team ab chhattisgarh main bhi haath paanv maar rahi he ki kahin uskaa sambandh vyaapman se to nahin tha
 It cannot be that the scam that was going on in Madhya Pradesh with political patronage was being done in Chhattisgarh by the grace of God
 agast 2013 main siaidi ko ek gupt chitthee mili ki chhattisgarh ke medical collejon main doctorl kii padhai kar rahe kai chaatr piemti main shaamil nahin hue the
 The names of the students were given in that letter and it was said that someone else had taken the exam instead
 siaidi ne jaanch kii to 2007 se 2010 ke bich 45 farji ummidavaar saamne aae
 Only 25 challans have been produced against them and the police have not been able to arrest one and a half dozen accused students
 donon hi sarkarein 2010-11 main shant raheen
 During this time such cases had also come up in Madhya Pradesh
 mukhyamantri raman singh ko bhi bataanaa chahie ki unhone kya kiya or unki police kis nattejey par pahunchi he
 Whose children were enrolled in Chhattisgarh? dainik bhaskar kii khabar main yah bhi he ki kuch chaatr zamaanat par reeha hokar waapas padhane to chale gaye lekin pichley paanch saat saalon main ek do saal kii padhai bhi puri nahin kar paae hai
 Now come on Kamal Khan's report
 hamaare netaa afasar or giroh mil jaae to kya nahin kar sakate hai bas aapke kisi honhaar bachche ko hameshaa ke liye barbaad hona padegaa
 Look at these posters of Wattend in medical colleges of UP
 ye kathith rup se solver hai jinaki talash madhya pradesh kii estf kar rahi he
 Most of the nearly 200 solvers belong to up's medical college
 estf ko kanpur medical college ke 58 chaatro kii talash he jin par paise lekar duusare ke badale pariksha dene kaa andeh he
 Out of these 23 students were also arrested and released on bail and came to college
 kuch abhi bhi jail main hai or kuch faraar
 If he had passed, he would have become a doctor, but the trust of money and political power made him a criminal
 mainpuri se giraftaar ek solver ne madhya pradesh ko rajyapal ramanaresh yadav ke bete kaa naam liya tha jinaki sandigdh halaat main lakhanu main maut ho gai
 With this comes the question that when the NDA government was formed, some UPA governors were also removed for alleged corruption but how did Ramnaresh Yadav survive
 madhya pradesh hoicourt ne rajyapal ke khilaaf exiaar radd kar di he lekin jab aarope lage the tab bhi nahin hataae gaye
 For the past several days, it was being argued that Ujjain's Namrata committed suicide but now facts are coming out that the medical student Namrata Damor was killed
 namrata ke parivaar kaa intervyuu karne ke dauraan patrkaar akshay singh kii maut ho gai thi
 Namrata's role in Vyapam is not clear but his body was found on a railway track in Ujjain
 janvari 2012 kii postmart report kahati he uski maut VIOLENT ASPHYXIA yani dam ghontkar kii gai thi
 The question arises whether the police gave the statement without looking at the post mortem report
 kiske dabaav main aatmahatya qaraar diya gaya
 Namrata's brother says that there was pressure from the administration to compromise
 tippaniyan On Tuesday, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh wrote a letter to the Madhya Pradesh High Court asking the case to be handed over to the CBI but the Jabalpur High Court said that there are several petitions in the Supreme Court in this regard, so the decision is out of jurisdiction
 udhar buudhvaar ko supreme court kii dabl bench ne special bench banane kaa suzav diya he
 Today, there has been another progress in the pen drive case of whistle blower Prashant Pandey
 wheasal blor apni pen driev estf ko de di yah kah kar isamen asli saboot hai
 The STF reported to the SIT that the evidence in the pen drive is fake
 hoicourt ne esaiti kii report par kaha ki pratham drushtya ham sahamat hai
 Prashant Pandey went to Delhi High Court with a pen drive
 vahaan madhya pradesh sarkaar ne kaha ki pen driev farzi he or hamen zarurat nahin he
 The Delhi High Court gave the pen drive to the Jabalpur High Court
 do haftaa pehle jis pen driev ko estf ne khaarij kar diya tha waapas court se kaha ki hamen de di jaae
 The court sought an opinion from Amicus Curiae that has been submitted on Wednesday
 20 july ko jabalpur hai court is par apana faisla de sakati he
 Amicus Curiae reports in a sealed envelope
 khaas to nahin bataaya par unki baton se laga ki ve bina jaanch ke pen driev ko phenkane ke paksh main nahin hai
 So the government's claim on pen drive also seems to prove to be half incomplete
 6 july 2013 ko indore ke hotel se 6 solver pakade jate hai
 Solver calls him who is a doctor but if he takes money, he examines someone in other states
 police kaa chapa padaa to ye solver hadabada gaye or bhed khulne lage
 But after 9 days the results of Vyapam were declared
 13 july ko nattejey aane ke baad usee raat solver ghotaale kaa sargana jagadish sagar giraftaar bhi hua lekin iske baad bhi sarkaar ne admician ke liye counselling kii prakriya shuru kii or jaldi puri kar lee
 The government admitted the students by taking an affidavit that if found guilty in future, the nomination would be deemed canceled
 mukhyamantri chouhan ne dobaaraa pariksha kyon nahin karai
 When and what action was taken against the officers of Vyapam
 unki sakhti ke baad bhi unka purv pie or rajya pichhadaa ayog ke sadsy ab tak faraar kaise hai
 Let me tell you a story of Poonam Sharma
 july maheene main jab ghotaalaa saamne aayaa to punam sharma or kuch chaatr court gaye ki pariksha radd kar di jaae lekin faisle kaa intazaar hi karte rah gaye
 Meanwhile, even after the arrest of Jagdish Sagar, the government started the counseling process for admission
 chaatro se halafanama le liya ki bhavishya main doshi paae gaye to namakan radd mana jayega
 In October 2013, 135 suspected students were fired
 tab punam jaise kuch parikshaarthi maang karne lage ki unki jagah duusare chaatro kaa namakan hona chahie
 Poonam Sharma was not far from the rank at which admission was closed
 wo supreme court tak gai lekin tab tak namakan kii aakhri taarikh 30 sitambar biit chuki tha
 In December 2013, Poonam and some of the examinees also went on hunger strike
 kismat acchhee thi ki 2014 kii pravesh pariksha sibiesai ke eipamti se karai gai
 Poonam again became a doctor
 ek sipaahi kii beti or paanch bahanon main se ek punam zarur acha doctor banegi

 is bich jagadish sagar kii giraftaar ke baad bhi sarkaar ne admician ke liye counselling kii prakriya shuru kar di
 Took the affidavit from the students that if found guilty in future, the nomination would be considered canceled
 oktober 2013 main 135 sandigdh chaatro ko nikaal diya gaya
 Then some candidates like Poonam started demanding that other students should be enrolled in their place
 jis rank par admician band hua tha usase bahut dur nahin thi punam sharma
 She went to the Supreme Court but by then the last date for nomination had passed 30 September
 disambar 2013 main punam or kuch parikshaarthiyon ne bhukh hadtaal bhi kii
 Luckily, the 2014 entrance exam was conducted by AIPMT of CBSE
 punam phir se doctor ban gai
 Poonam will definitely become a good doctor, a soldier's daughter and one of five sisters
 lekin jo bachche barbaad ho gaye unki dastaan koun sunegaa
 a similar scam was also exposed in Chhattisgarh in 2010-11
 buudhvaar ke raipur dainik bhaskar main chhapi khabar aap bhi dekh sakate hai
 In a Dharamshala in Takhatpur near Bilaspur, the children and their parents were filling in the form
 bhaskar ke anusaar har chaatr se parchaa li karne ke 13 lakh liye gaye or vahaan ek raat main aath karod kaa korabar hua
 The team investigating Vyapam is now shaking hands in Chhattisgarh whether it was related to Vyapam
 aisa to ho nahin saktaa ki jo ghotaalaa madhya pradesh main raajnneetik sangrakshan ke saath chal rahaa tha chhattisgarh main ishwar kii krupa se ho rahaa tha
 In August 2013, the CID received a secret letter that many students studying in medical colleges in Chhattisgarh did not attend PMT
 us chitthee main chaatro ke naam diye gaye the or kaha gaya tha ki inaki jagah kisi or ne pariksha di thi
 Between 2007 and 2010, 45 fake candidates were revealed by the CID
 25 ke khilaaf hi chaalaan pesh kiya ja sakaa he or dedh darjan aaropee chaatro ko police giraftaar nahin kar pai he
 Both governments remained quiet in 2010-11
 is dauraan aise maamle madhya pradesh main bhi aa chuke the
 Chief Minister Raman Singh should also tell what he did and what his police has reached
 chhattisgarh main jin bacchon kaa namakan hua wo kinake the
 It is also reported in Dainik Bhaskar that some students got released on bail and went back to study, but in the last five-seven years, they have not completed even one year of studies
 ab aaiye kamaal khan kii report par
 If our leaders, officers and gangs meet, what can they not do? Just one of your promising children will be ruined forever
 upi ke medical colejo main watend ke in postaron ko dekhiye
 These are allegedly solvers whose search for the STF of Madhya Pradesh
 kareeb 200 solveron main se zyaadaatar upi ke medical college ke hai
 STF is looking for 58 students of Kanpur Medical College who are suspected of taking money and taking exams instead of others
 inamen se 23 chaatr giraftaar bhi hue or zamaanat par reeha hokar college aa gaye
 Some are still in jail and some are absconding
 ye paas hote to doctor banate lekin paise or raajnneetik satta ke bharose ne inhen apradhi bana diya
 a solver arrested from Mainpuri had named Madhya Pradesh Governor Ramnaresh Yadav's son, who died in Lucknow under suspicious circumstances
 isi ke saath sawaal aata he ki jab endie sarkaar banate hi upie ke kuch rajyapalon ko kathith bhrashtachar ke aarope main bhi hataaya gaya lekin ramanaresh yadav kaise batch gaye
 The Madhya Pradesh High Court has quashed the FIR against the Governor but was not dropped even when the allegations were made
 pichley kai dinon se daleel di ja rahi thi ki ujjain kii namrata ne aatmahatya kii he lekin ab tathy saamne aa rahe hai ki medical kii chaatra namrata damor ko maaraa gaya tha
 Journalist Akshay Singh died while interviewing Namrata's family
 vyaapman main namrata kii bhoomika spasht nahin he lekin iskaa shav ujjain main railway trek par mila tha
 The January 2012 Postmart Report says that he was killed by VIOLENT ASPHYXIA
 sawaal ye uthta he ki kya police ne bina postmortem report dekhe bayaan de diya tha
 Under whose pressure was it called suicide
 namrata ke bhai kaa kahana he ki prashasan kii taraf se dabaav daalaa gaya ki samjhauta kar len
 The comments mangalvaar ko mukhyamantri shivaraj singh ne madhya pradesh hoicourt ko chitthee likhi thi ki maamle ko sibiai ko saunpa jaae lekin jabalpur hoicourt ne kaha ki is babat supreme court main kai yachikaayen vichaaradhin hai, lihaaza faisla karnaa adhikaar kshetra se baahar he
 On the other hand, on Wednesday, the double bench of the Supreme Court suggested to make a special bench
 aaj wheasal blor prashanth pandey ke pen driev maamle main ek or pragati hui he
 There is real evidence in this saying that the whistle blower gave his pen drive to STF
 estf ne esaiti ko report di ki pen driev main saboot nakli hai
 The High Court said on the SIT report that prima facie we agree
 prashanth pandey pen driev lekar dilli hai court chale gaye
 The Madhya Pradesh government said that the pen drive is fake and we do not need it
 dilli hoicourt ne pen driev jabalpur hai court ko de di
 Two weeks ago, the pen drive that the STF had rejected asked the court to give it to us
 court ne emicas cure se is bare main raay maangi jo buudhvaar ko jamaa kar di gai he
 The Jabalpur High Court can give its verdict on this on 20 July
 emicas cure ne apni report sil band lipaphe main di he
 Did not say anything specific, but his words showed that he was not in favor of throwing the pen drive without investigation
 to pen driev par bhi sarkaar kaa daawa aadha adhuraa hi sabit hota dikh rahaa he

 Under the fourth edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), a league match will be played between the Pune Warriors and Kochi Tuskers Kerala teams on Wednesday at the Dr
 DY Patil Sports Complex
 ipel kii in do sabase nai tiimon ke bich hone vaala yah muqabla kai lihaaj se rochak hoga
 While this match will give the Pune team playing under the captaincy of Yuvraj Singh a chance to get a second win, Kochi will try to forget the defeat in the first match and open the winning account
 pune kii team ne vidarbha ke yuva gendbaaj shrikant vaagh kii shandaar gendbaaji kii badaulat isi maidan par shanivaar ko kings ilevan punjab ko saat wicket se parajeet kiya tha
 Wagh took three wickets in that match and was elected man of the match
 ballebaaji main mithun manhas or jesi rider ke alaava captain yuvaraj or robin uthppa ne khulkar haath dikhaae the or 113 ranon ke lakshya kaa peechha kar rahi apni team ko 41 gend shesh rahete hi vijayshri dilaa di thi
 During the bowling, Yuvraj surprised the batsmen of his old team Kings XI with a great mix of spin and medium pace
 majboot punjab kii team ko haraane ke baad kochi ke khilaaf bhi yuvaraj kii yahi ranneeti rahegi
 On the other hand, Kochi's team lost by six wickets to Royal Challengers Bangalore in their first match
 srilanka ke purv captain mahela jayavardhane kii captaini main khel rahi is team ne ballebaaji main acha damakham dikhaate hue paanch wicket par 161 ran banaae the, lekin uske gendbaaj stareey pradarshan nahin kar sake the
 In batting, Brendon mccullum, VVS Laxman, Brad Hodge and Ravindra Jadeja played good innings, but the Kochi bowlers could not do justice to their talent under the leadership of Rudra Pratap Singh, who played a key role in getting the Deccan Chargers the title
 yahaan tak ki muthaiya muralidharan jaise champion gendbaaj ko ek bhi safalataa nahin mili thi, kyonki abraham divilliars ke netritv main bangalore ke ballebaajon ne stareey pradarshan karte hue chaar wicket ke nuksaan par hi lakshya hasil kar liya tha
 De Villiers had hit a half-century while Mayank Agarwal played a brilliant innings of 33 runs
 vah match kochi ke liye ek sabak tha, kyonki acha score khadaa karne ke baavjood vah jeet hasil nahin kar sakaa tha
 In such a situation, his strategy against Pune will be mainly focused on scoring big scores and maintaining his bowling and fielding level

 idhar ahmedabad main manmohan singh sarkaar par hamalaa bolenge to duusari taraf vittamantri arun jetali nai dilli se morcha sanbhaalenge
 Arun Jaitley can answer the questions raised by the former PM
 saaf he ki notebandi kii saalagirah par sarkaar or vipaksh ke tevar talkh ho rahe hai
 And in this battle, now former PM and current Finance Minister are face to face

 Demonetisation has caused the most damage to the region

 However, in this operation, the Army has already lost one of its Colonel Santosh Mahadik on 17 November

 Senior army officials say that this area is surrounded by high altitude and dense forests and we do not want any kind of loss

 congress ke republican sadsy walstreet par najar rakhane sambandhi sudhaar ko waapas liye jane ke liye prayaas kar rahe hai, jis par obama ne 2010 main hastakshar kar use kanoon main parivartit kar diya tha
 The law came into existence in response to the recession and financial crisis that began in 2007

 The same cycle went on and the banks of India got caught in the npa's trap! This was the Prime Minister, two months ago, in the Lok Sabha, while discussing the no-confidence motion! They were telling how the banks were looted during the UPA era
 netaa, sarkaar, bicheliye milakar bakaayaa karj kii dendaree taal (ristracchar kar) dete the
 This loot opened if the government changed
 sakchati kii ja rahi he
 No one will be forgiven anymore
 saath din bhi nahin beete ki ab sarkaar rigerv bank par hi ankhen tarer rahi he ki bakaayaa karj ko lekar bainkon par kuch zyada hi sakhti ho gai
 There is a shortage of debt
 karjadaaron ko riyaayat milani chahie
 Recovery of outstanding debt of power companies should be avoided
 is dil badal kaa sabab kya he?chunaav kii dhamak ke saath paardarshita ke sankalpon kii shavyatra prarambh ho gai he
 Six months ago, the government, swearing on the sanitation drive of banks, has clamped down on the autonomy of the Reserve Bank to cover the sludge of outstanding debt
 banking sudhaaron ke saare daawey or vaade sir ke bal khadey hokar nrity kar rahe hai
 In 2015, the same ministers of this government, who are teaching the constitution to the regulators today, were saying that if the Modi government had not come, the country would not know how the loans were given on the loan
 sarkaar ko fakhr tha ki usne rigerv bank ko enpie (bakaayaa karj) pahchaanane kaa formula badalane ko kaha taaki sach saamne aa sake
 The Reserve Bank changed the formula to put banks struggling with outstanding debt under a new system called Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)
 iske tahat rakhe gaye 11 sarkari baikon ko branch network badhaane, karj vitaran simit karne, labhaansh baantne par roak lagaai gai
 They have to spend a large part of their profits in making capital in lieu of outstanding debt
 unka munafa gir rahaa he
 The Reserve Bank has asked banks to bring capital from their owners or the government, otherwise they are at risk of drowning
 achraj dekhie ki pisie pichley ek saal se amal main he
 Till yesterday the government was ballooning on this strictness
 use lagata tha ki bainkon ko bachaane ke liye yah jaruri he
 In June, public sector banks had submitted their revival plan to the government under this PCA, but now government officials are heard saying that the Reserve Bank did not consult the finance ministry in creating PCA
 yahi sarkaar he jo sansad main mej thok kar kah rahi thi ki bainkon ke karjadaaron ko bachaane kii upie kii niti ab khatm ho chuki he
 But now it feels that private power companies should be kept out of it
 bank unhen bakaayaa karj main riyaayat den
 In fact, in the electoral fray, the affidavits of honesty and Kaul's screams of reform are flying
 bakaayaa karj ko lekar rigerv bank kii sakhti achaanak sarkaar ko isliye khalane lagi he kyonki use ab bainkon se saste karj bantwane yani loklubhaavan istemaal kii jarurat he
 The government also wants that the Reserve Bank should also provide capital to troubled non-banking financial companies
 lekin koi bhi niamak kaise sahamat hoga ki sudhaaron kii ibaarat chunaav dekhakar badal di jaani chahie
 If there is an election then why should banks stop vigorously to get the outstanding debt out of the vortex? NPA rules should be the same for everyone! How is it ethical to distribute bailout from depositors money for business mistakes! In fact, there is only one group in India that does everything only by looking at elections
 or shaayad koi kaam yaa kaarobaar sirf paanch saal kii expyri date ke saath shuru nahin hota
 Whatever political parties want to do with their electoral promises, but when they start to put policies on their head, it is the duty of independent regulators to show the mirror to the government
 rigerv bank ko dhamka rahi sarkaar kya samaj paa rahi he ki loktantr main chune pratinidhi isliye sarvocch hai kyonki ve sanvaidhanik sansthaaon kii swaittata kii hifaazat karne ke liye bheje jate hai, unhen daraane ke liye nahin

 My dear youth, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, many times i have said in 'mann Ki Baat' that our younger generation should be attracted towards science
 desh ko bahut saare vaigyanikon kii zarurat he
 Today's scientist causes a permanent change in the lives of generations to come in the coming ages
 mahatma gandhi kaha karte the – “no science has dropped from the skies in a perfect form
 All sciences develop and are built up through experience
 ”poojya baapu ne ye bhi kaha tha – “I have nothing but praise for the zeal, industry and sacrifice that have animated the modern scientists in the pursuit after truth
 "science when keeping in mind the needs of the common people, how to make easy use of those principles; What should be the medium for that; what should be the technology; Because it is considered to be the biggest important contribution for the common man
 pichley dinon, niti ayog evam bharat ke videsh mantralay ne 14wein pravasi bhartiya diwas ke samay ek badi unique prakaar kii competition kii yojana kii thi
 The society was invited for useful innovation
 aise innovations ko identify karnaa, showcase karnaa, logon ko jaankaree dena or aise innovation jan-saamaanya ke liye kaise kaam aaen, mass production kaise ho, uski commercial utilization kaise ho, or maine jab use dekha, to maine dekha ki kitne bade mahatvapurn kaam kiye hai
 Just like i saw an innovation, which has been made for our poor fisherman brothers
 ek saamaanya Mobile App banaai he, lekin uski taaqat itani he ki machuaaraa fishing ke liye jab jaataa he, to kahan janaa; sabase zyada fish zone acha kahan par he; hawa kii disha kya he; speed kya he; laharon kii oonchai kitni he - yani ek Mobile App par sari jaankariyaan uplabdh or isse hamaare machuaare bhai bahut hi kam samay main jahaan adhik machhliyaan hai, vahaan pahunch karke apana arth-uparjan kar sakate hai

 Our peasant brothers and sisters have worked hard to fill the granary
 hamaare desh main kisaanon ke parishram se is varsh record ann utpaadan hua he
 All the signs are saying that our farmers have broken all the old records
 kheton main is baar fasal aisi laharaai he, har rose lagane laga, jaise pongal or baisakhi aaj hi manaai he
 This year more than two thousand seven hundred million tons of food grains have been produced in the country
 hamaare kisaanon ke naam jo aakiri record ankit hua tha, usase bhi ye 8% zyaada he, to ye apane-aap main abhootpurv siddhi he
 i especially want to thank the farmers of the country
 kisaanon kaa dhanyavad isaliye bhi karnaa chahta hoon ki ve paramparaagat fasalon ke saath-saath desh ke garib ko dhyaan main rakhte hue alag-alag daalon kii bhi kheti karen, kyonki daal se hi sabase zyaada protein garib ko praapt hota he

 ye sirf daal kaa utpaadan nahin he, kisaanon ke dwaara hui mere desh ke garibon kii sabase badi seva he
 My farmer brothers and sisters deserve special thanks for a prayer, a request of mine, for the way in which the farmers of my country worked hard and produced a record of pulses

 17-18 farvari ko hyderabad main toilet pit emptying exercise kaa aayojan kiya
 Six household toilet pits were emptied and cleaned, and the officers themselves showed that the pits used for the twin pit toilet could be emptied and reused
 unhone yah bhi dikhaaya ki yah nai technique ke shauchalay kitne suvidhajanak hai or inhen khaali karne main safaai ko lekar ke koi asuvidha mahasoos nahi hoti he, koi sankoch nahi hota he; jo psychological barrier hota he, wo bhi aade nahi aata he or ham bhi or saamaanya safaai karte hai, vaise hi ek toilet ke gadde saafe kar sakate hai; or is prayaas kaa parinaam hua, desh ke media ne isko bahut prachaarit bhi kiya, usko mahatv bhi diya
 And naturally, when an IAS officer cleans the toilet pit himself, it is very natural to get attention of the country
 or ye jo toilet pit kii safaai he or usamen se jo jise aap-ham kooda-kachra maanate hai, lekin khaad kii drushti se dekhen, to ye ek prakaar se ye kaala sona hota he

 The waste can then be easily removed and redirected to another pit
 chah-baarah maheenon main pit main jamaa kachra puri tarah se decompose ho jaataa he
 It is very safe to handle decomposed garbage and very important fertilizer 'NPK'
 kisaan bhalee-bhanti ‘NPK’ se parichit hai, Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium - ye poshak tatwon se purna hota he; or yah krishi kshetra main bahut hi uttam khaad mana jaataa he
 The way the government has taken this initiative, others have also done many such initiatives

 Pakistan has now arrested 44 terrorists, including two brothers of Jaish gangster Masood Azhar, after the Pulwama attack
 pakistan ke aantarik maamalon ke mantri shehryaar afridi ne aaj kaha ki masood ajahar ke bhai mufti abdul rauf or hammaad ajahar samet 44 aatankiyon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya he
 However, Shaharyar claimed that these arrests were not made under any pressure
 ek press conference main shehryaar ne daawa kiya ki pakistan sarkaar kaa ye ection kisi bahari dabaav main nahin he
 These actions have been taken against all banned organizations
 jaish sargana masood ajahar ke bhai mufti abdul rauf or hammaad ajahar kii giraftaar ko bhale hi pakistan bharat kaa dabaav maanane se inkaar kare, lekin ye jagajaahir he ki pulavama hamale ke baad pakistan par aatanki sanghathanon par ection lene kaa chautarafa dabaav pad rahaa he
 That is why Pakistan has arrested both brothers of Masood Azhar
 shehryaar ne press conference main kaha ki bharat ne jo dogier saunpa he, usamen masood ke in donon bhaaiyon kaa naam bhi shaamil tha
 The Pakistani minister claimed that a meeting was held on Monday under the National Action Plan, which decided that swift action should be taken against all the banned organizations
 pulavama hamale ke baad se chautarafa ghira pakistan duniya ko dikhaanaa chahta he ki wo aatankwaad par nakel kas rahaa, lekin hakeekat kuch or hi he
 Actually, Pakistan is trying to throw dust in the eyes of the world by doing so
 isaki baangi us samay bhi dikhi jab usne daawa kiya ki jud par pratibandh laga diya gaya he, jabaki aisa tha nahin
 Before the FATF meeting, the news that Pakistan has banned jamaat-ud-dawa, the organization of most wanted terrorist Hafiz Saeed, turned out to be false
 jo list saamne ai, usase khulaasa hua tha ki paak kii sarkaar ne is sanghathan par bain nahin lagaaya he, balki sirf in par nigaraanee rakhane kii baat kahi he
 According to data from Pakistan's National Counter Terrorism Authority, the PAK government has taken action against many terrorist organizations
 inamen se kuch par bain lagaaya gaya he jabaki kuch par nigaraanee rakhi ja rahi he
 Among those being monitored are Hafiz Saeed's jamaat-ud-dawa and falah-e-insaniyat Foundation
 isse saaf he ki pakistan jo duniyabar ke saamne kah rahaa tha ki vah aatankiyon ke khilaaf kade ection le rahaa he or shanti chahta he wo sab ek safed jhooth niklaa
 However, many big organizations are included in the organizations that have been asked to ban in this list
 inamen moulana masood ajahar kaa jaish bhi shaamil he

 Meenakshi Kandwal moderated this session
 himesh ne nae compoger or singrs ko kya di khaas salaah?himesh ne kaha- aaj ke jamaane main brake milanaa kahin naa kahin aasaan ho gaya he
 But the problem is how you will sustain
 brake to mil jaataa he lekin sasten karnaa mushkil he

 It is very important to work hard for this
 1, 2 do gane ko hit ho jate hai lekin aage use barkaar kaise rakhaa jaae
 What is needed to stay in the industry? Himesh said- 'I think if 25 songs of a composer are worth listening to, then they composed two and a half thousand songs

 bihar ke bhagalpur jile ke 'srijan' ghotaale ke maamle main argedy supremeo lalu prasad ne bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or vitt mantri susheel kumaar par jamkar hamalaa bolaa he
 At a press conference on Sunday, Lalu Prasad has blamed both of them directly for the scam
 lalu ne press confrans main kareeb ek darjan sawaal uthaakar yah bataane kii koshish kii ki is ghotaale kii saal 2013 se hi mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko jaankaree thi or unhone is par koi karrwai nahin kii
 Not only this, the then District Magistrate who started the investigation of the scam was transferred
 gauratlab he ki bihar main haal ke dinon ke bhagalpur ke sabase bade srijan ghotaale main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne sibiai jaanch kii sifarish kii he
 'srujan' is an NGO, which worked for the development of women in the district, in fact, the main business of this institution was crores of crores
 is sanstha ne pichley kai varshon se bainkon kii mileebhagat se sarkari jamaa khate se takreeban 300 karod rupee se zyada kii avaidh nikasi kii
 The state's politics has been hot about this scam
 lalu ke sawalalalu prasad yadav ne 'srijan' ghotaale ke maamle main bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or vitt mantri susheel kumaar modi se kai sawaal puche hai
 The questions asked by Lalu at the press conference are as follows: 1) On July 25, 2013, a chartered accountant and social worker named Sanjit Kumar wrote a detailed letter to Chief Minister Bihar giving information about running the creation women's bank and embezzlement of crores, But Chief Minister Nitish Kumar did not take any action on him and saved the scamsters, but they looted the government treasury Sector encouraged
 2) 9 sitambar 2013 ko reserve bank ne, bihar sarkaar ko patr likhakar 'srijan samiti' main ho rahe ghotaale or weetiya aniyamitata kii jaanch karne ko kaha tha
 The Reserve Bank had also asked the Co-operative Registrar to take action, but the Chief Minister did not take any action on that either
 mukhyamantri ne reserve bank ke andeh ko bhi darkinar karte hue lagaataar ghotalebaajon kaa sahyog kiya
 3) In 2013, the then DM ordered an inquiry after receiving a complaint in the 'creation' case, but the investigation report did not come up till date
 nitish bataaen, us jaanch report ko kyon dabaaya gaya? us jaanch report ko dabaakar kise phayda pahunchaaya gaya?4) 2013 main 'srijan' ghotaale main jaanch kaa aadesh dene vaale jiladhikari kaa mukhyamantri ne tabadalaa kyon kiya?5) 2006 se chal rahe is ghotaale main mukhyamantri ne 10 saal tak karrwai kyon nahin kii? mukhyamantri or vitt mantri susheel modi is maamle ke sidhe doshi hai
 6) The Economic Offenses Wing seized crores of rupees of Jaishree Thakur, the Bihar government official involved in the creation scam
 uske baavjood bhi aarthik aparaadh shakha ne puure ghotaale kii anusandhan kiske ishaare par nahin kii? 2005 se grih vibhaag nitish ke paas he
 Why did Nitish hide the investigation of Economic Offenses Wing? Why not take action on it? 7) 7 crore 32 lakh rupees were seized from the creation account of Bihar government official Jayashree Thakur
 14 july 2013 ke hindustan akhbaar kii khabar anusaar tatkaaleen pradhan sachiv ne kaha tha kii jayshri ADM str kii adhikari he, isliye use seva se barkhaast karne kaa adhikaar mukhyamantri ke paas he, lekin mukhyamantri ne use itane varshon tak barkhaast kyon nahin kiya?8) jayshri thakur kii adhikansh posting bhagalpur or baankaa main hi karne kaa mukhyamantri kaa uddeshy tha? sanad rahe ki saamaanya prashasan or carmik vibhaag mukhyamantri ke paas rahaa he or unheen kii ichha anusaar jayshri thakur ko baankaa kaa bhu-arjan padaadhikari rahete hue bhagalpur kaa atirikt prabhaar diya gaya?9) 2010 main bhi hamane AC / DC ghotaale ko uthaaya tha, uske baavjood bhi nitish sarkaar ne aise ghotaalon ko jari rakhaa
 10) In 2010-11 CAG in its report mentioned irregularities of 11000-12000 thousand crores of government treasury? Even then, no action was taken? 11) Who are fooling the Chief Minister on the orders of CBI investigation? Does he not know the circular of RBI, in which it is clear that if there is any financial irregularity of more than 30 crores, then CBI will investigate it? This is a Mahaghotala of 15000 crores

 pashchim bengal ke sunderbans delta kshetra main pichley ek saal main 14000 se bhi zyada log laapata ho gaye hai
 This figure was given by the Minister of State for Home Affairs in the Lok Sabha in response to a question last month
 kolkata se sunderbans ke is ilaake main pahunchane ke liye road se do ghante kaa safar karnaa padataa he or phir naav kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 Here a village Sandeshkhali is ready to welcome you with all its troubles
 yahaan logon ek taraf baaghon ke hamale se do-chaar hona padataa he vahiin garibi ne maanav taskari kii ore dhakel diya he
 More than eight thousand girls are included in the missing people and five and a half thousand men are also said to be missing leaving the family
 maanav taskari karne vaale dallalon ke liye sandeshkhali ilaaka kaaphi mahatvapurn mana jaataa he
 There is hardly a single village where a forced mother is not waiting for her missing daughter
 tamaam samasyaon se ghire is sandeshkhali gaanv ko 'ailaa' naam ke tufaan ne varsh 2009 main kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaaya tha
 Poverty has spread here for years
 halaat yah he ki maa ko mamata kaa galaa ghont kar apane bacchon ko saikadon mile dur kaam karne ke liye bhejnaa padataa he
 When Kishyalaya Bhattacharya of NDTV visited the area, the mother of a 16-year-old missing girl told that she was taken to Hyderabad six years ago on the promise of a job
 dalal ne parivaar ko bataaya tha ki ladki ke vetan kaa kuch hissaa har maheene unhen diya jayega
 But once the girl is gone, till date neither the child has any news nor the promise made by the broker has ever been fulfilled
 ek chappar ke chote se ghar main rah rahi is maa kaa kahana he ki ek saal ke vaade ke saath bacchee ko lekar gaye the lekin har saal durga puja, kaali puja ai magar bacchee kabhi waapas nahin ai
 This mother has four children with two girls and her monthly income is only one thousand rupees
 isi se is baad kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki jab agali baar dalal aayega tab bhi yah dukhiyaari use manaa nahin kar paaegi
 It is not that anyone in the village will leave and work
 yahaan, maanav taskari karne waalon kaa ek sargana bhi he jise hari ke naam se gaanv vaale jaanate hai
 It acts as a link between the agencies delivering the green girls to the mandis and the servants in the cities
 jab enditivi ne hari is bare main jaananaa chaha to use na keval dhamkee di balki camera chhinane kaa prayaas bhi kiya
 Hari sells girls in the nearby city
 yahaan se shahar tak pahunchane main ladakiyon tamaam haathon se guzarana padataa he
 Girls who do not reach the chaklaghar reach a servant supply agency
 tippaniyan The agencies involved in the trade of such girls make sure that they get the work money on time but the remuneration never reaches the real entitlement of the salary
 aise halaaton main fansi ladakiyon ke liye apane gharon tak kii vaapasi kaa rasta lagbhag band hi rahata he
 In such a situation, even God cannot tell how a common man lives
 grih mantralay ne rajya sarkaron ko nirdesh diya tha ki har jile main maanav taskari ke virodh main ikaaiyaan taiyaar kii jaaen
 Work was started in West Bengal three years ago
 har unit main paanch sadsy ke saath camera, cellphone or ek gaadi kii vyavastha honi chahie
 The need for such a unit was first realized when a report was submitted by the Human Rights Commission in the year 2006 that 45,000 children go missing every year in the country
 kolkata se sunderbans ke is ilaake main pahunchane ke liye road se do ghante kaa safar karnaa padataa he or phir naav kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he

 The need for such a unit was first realized when a report was submitted by the Human Rights Commission in the year 2006 that 45,000 children go missing every year in the country
 laapata logon main aath hajaar se bhi zyada ladkiyaan shaamil hai or saadhe paanch hajaar purush bhi parivaar ko chhod laapata bataae ja rahe hai
 Sandeshkali area is considered very important for human trafficking brokers
 is gaanv ko shaayad hi ek bhi aisa hoga jahaan ek majaboor maa apni laapata beti kaa intjaar na kar rahi ho
 Surrounded by all the problems, this Sandeshkhali village was severely damaged in the year 2009 by the storm named 'aila'
 saalon se yahaan garibi ne paanv pasaar rakhe hai
 The situation is that the mother has to strangle Mamta and send her children to work hundreds of miles away
 enditivi ke kishlay bhattacharya ne jab ilaake kaa daura kiya tab ek 16 varshiya laapata bacchee kii maa ne bataaya ki chah varsh pehle use hyderabad main ek naukari ke vaade par le jaaya gaya tha
 The broker had told the family that some part of the girl's salary would be given to her every month
 lekin ek baar bacchee kya gai aaj tak na to bacchee kii koi khabar he or na hi dalal dwaara kiye gaye vaade ko kabhi puraa kiya gaya
 This mother, living in a small thatch house, says that with the promise of one year she had taken the girl but every year Durga Puja, Kali Puja came but the girl never returned
 is maa ke paas do ladakiyon ke saath chaar bachche hai or inaki masik aay maatr ek hajaar rupee hai
 From this it can be guessed that even when the broker comes next time, even this miser will not be able to refuse him
 aisa nahin ki gaanv main koi bhi chalaa jayega or kaam karke nikal jayega
 Here, there is also a ringleader of human traffickers known by the villagers as Hari
 yah hari ladakiyon ke mandiyon tak pahunchane waalon or shaharon main naukar ke kaam dilaane vaali agenciyon ke bich kadi kaa kaam karata he
 When NDTV wanted to know about this, Hari not only threatened him but also tried to snatch the camera
 hari najadik shahar main ladkiyaan bech detaa he
 Girls have to go through all the hands to reach the city from here
 jo ladkiyaan chaklaghar tak nahin pahunchati vah kisi naukar supplai karne vaali agency par pahunch jaati he
 The comments is tarah kii ladakiyon ke vyapaar main shaamil agency is baat ko pakkaa kar leti hai ki unhen samay par kaam kaa paisa mil jaae lekin vetan ke asli hakdaar tak mehtaanaa kabhi nahin pahunchataa
 In such circumstances, the path of return to their homes for trapped girls is almost closed
 aise main ek aam aadmi kii jindagi inhen kaise mili yah to bhagwaan bhi nahin bataa saktaa he
 The Ministry of Home Affairs had directed the State Governments to prepare units against human trafficking in every district
 pashchim bengal main teen saal pehle is par amal karne kaa kaam shuru kiya gaya
 Each unit should have a camera, cellphone and a car with five members
 is tarah kii ikai kii jarurat tab sabase pehle mahasoos kii gai jab varsh 2006 main maanavadhikaar ayog dwaara yah report pesh kii gai ki desh main har saal 45 hajaar bachche laapata ho jate hai

 It is about four months before Rahul Gandhi becomes Congress President
 party adhyaksh ke naate unki pehali badi pariksha karnataka vidhansabha chunaav hai jahaan 12 may ko voting honi he
 On the one hand, Rahul's focus is on saving the Congress fort in Karnataka, on the other hand, he wants the new incarnation of Congress to be seen under his chairmanship
 rahul 'grand old party' main ek jatke kii bajaae kishton main badlaav kar rahe hai
 They are taking decisions swiftly but thoughtfully
 unki yahi koshish he ki kahin bhi koi baghawat kii gunjaaish naa rahe
 After consulting Sonia Gandhi's political adviser Ahmed Patel on several occasions, Rahul wants to keep them close
 aakhir kya he fark? party adhyaksh ke naate sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ke kaamkaaj main? sonia gandhi ke congress adhyaksh rahete hue ye party 10 saal tak centre kii satta main rahi, lekin ye bhi sach he ki unki adhyakshata main hi congress ne 2014 main apane loksabhaa chunavi itihaas kaa sabase kharaab pradarshan kiya
 The party was reduced to 44 seats in the Lok Sabha
 congress wo chunaav sonia ke netritv main beshak haari, lekin iske liye sabake nishane parrahul gandhihi rahe
 According to sources, Rahul always wanted that whenever he took command of the party, he should have the right to take all decisions related to the party
 yani is maamle main ve sonia kaa hastkshep bhi nahin chaahate
 Rahul remained the face of the party as long as the Congress vice-president, but remained mostly away from organizational decisions
 rahul ne beete saal disambar main congress kii kaman sanbhali to uske baad sonia gandhi ne aamtaur par party netaaon se milanaa band kar diya, jisase ki sabamein yahi sandesh jaae ki rahul hi party ke sarvesarva hai
 Rahul started taking decisions for the change in the party according to the party's command
 in faislon se ye jhalak mili ki sonia gandhi ke party adhyaksh rahete hue jo galtiyaan huin, unase sabak lete hue aage kaa rasta taiyaar kiya jaae
 For example, Rahul gave Randeep Singh Surjewala the responsibility of media for a short period of time
 rahul ne jab communication kii aadhunik takneekon ke istemaal, vakpatutaa or uplabdhta ke maapdandon par surajevaala ko khara paaya to media head ke taur par unki seat pakki karne main der nahin lagaai
 Realizing the importance of social media, Rahul Gandhi created a separate department in the party for the first time
 saath hi rahul ne shashi tharur or milind devda kii shakhsiyat ke mutabik unhen profeshnal congress kii jimmedaari de di
 Rahul also formed the labor-labor Congress, headed by Arvind Singh
 arvind singh lambey vakt se howers ke adhikaron ke liye ladate rahe hai
 Realizing the importance of data in the party, a separate department was also formed for this
 rahul ne party se machuaaron ko jodne ke liye alag se machuaaraa congress kaa gathan bhi kiya
 After taking over as president, Rahul Gandhi took 12 major decisions in political terms that could have far-reaching effects in the party
 1
 Ashok Gehlot's height increased, bringing the message of Ashok Gehlot in place of Janardhana Dwivedi to the post of party organization general secretary, conveying that not all the elders are being sidelined but a team of experience and new blood is being formed
 rajasthan ke purv mukhyamantri rah chuke ashok gahalot ne gujarat ke haalia vidhansabha chunaav main party prabharee mahasachiv ke naate khaasi mehnat kii thi, jo vahaan ke nateezon main bhi dekhne ko mili
 In such a situation, by increasing the stature of Gehlot, Rahul tried to give the message to the party leaders and workers that whoever does a better job will be rewarded
 2
 Removing CP Joshi Means of replacing Gohil as Bihar incharge, Rahul tried to give the message that there will be no delay in punishing him on bad performance
 rahul ne joshi kii jagah bihar kaa prabharee gujarat ke rajput netaa shakti singh gohil ko banaaya
 Gohil may have gone to the Assembly elections in Gujarat, but he is considered a fast-paced leader
 rahul ne gohil ko bihar kaa prabharee banaakar party line saaf kar di ki argedy ke saath gathjod kii sthiti main wo agadi jatiyon ko thamegi
 3
 arpyen singh ko jharkhand kii kamanrahul ne party adhyaksh banane ke baad purv kendriya grih rajya mantri arpyen singh ko jharkhand kii kaman di
 After taking command, RPN tied up with JMM and JVM and from there became a Rajya Sabha MP of the Congress
 arpyen kareeb ek dashak pehle jharkhand ke prabharee sachiv rahe hai or unka kaarykaal behatar mana gaya tha
 4
 chhattisgarh kaa prabhaar dalit netaa piel puniya kochhattisgarh main isi saal kii duusari chamahi main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Considering the sizeable population of SC and ST in the state, Rahul thought it better to play bet on the Dalit leader PL Punia as the incharge here
 5
 KC Venugopal, MP from Karnataka Youth Congress, who has been responsible for Venugopal from Youth Congress, has also considered the responsibility as incharge of Karnataka
 iske peeche ye soch ho sakati he ki karnataka kerala ke kareeb kaa rajya he, aise main venugopal vahaan kii paristhitiyon ko samajhane main behatar rahenge
 6
 anugrah narayan singh ko uttarakhand kaa prabharauttarakhand main rajputon kii zyada sankhya ko dekhte hue padosi rajya uttar pradesh se kai baar vidhayak rah chuke anugrah narayan singh ko prabhaar diya gaya
 Uttarakhand has previously been a part of Uttar Pradesh, so Anugrah Narayan Singh can understand the issues here very well
 7
 Mani Shankar Aiyar, who made a statement during Mani Shankar Aiyar's holiday in Gujarat, suspended Rahul from the party in a jolt, while he is considered close to the Gandhi family
 8
 Jitendra Singh in place of BK Hariprasad, Rahul Gandhi took charge of young Jitendra Singh, close to BK Hariprasad
 mana ja rahaa he ki ye faisla digvijay ke baad bhavishya main congress main rajput netaa ko ubhaarne kii koshish kii he
 Along with this, there is a message for Sachin Pilot to keep the path open for taking charge of the organization in Rajasthan
 jitendra singh or ashok gahalot, donon ko party kii kendriya raajnneeti main bade pad die jane ke raajnneetik jaankaar yahi myne laga rahe hai
 9
 jis rajya kaa netaa, vahiin se jaae rajyasabhahaal main rajyasabha ke chunaav main rahul ne saaf kar diya ki jis rajya se rajyasabha saansad chunaa janaa he, iske liye pehle usee rajya ke netaaon ko praathamikta mili
 Due to this, leaders like Janardan Dwivedi, Pramod Tiwari, Rajiv Shukla could not go to Rajya Sabha
 sirf abhishek manu singhvi apwaad rahe, jinako party ke liye cese ladane kaa puraskaar bengal se mila, wo bhi mamata banerjee kii madad se
 10
 apana koi raajnneetik salaahkaar nahirahul gandhi ne ab tak kisi ko apana rajnatik salaahkaar nahin banaaya he
 Whereas Sonia kept Ahmed Patel and before that Ahmed Patel - Ambika Soni
 sutron ke mutabik rahul nahin chaahate ki koi nayaa power centre bane
 11
 ek vyakti, ek padarahul gandhi kii koshish he kiparty main ek vyakti-ek padke siddhant kaa paalan kiya jaae
 Rahul is also running more and more on this
 jabaki sonia gandhi ke party adhyaksh rahete vakt pranab mukherjee, gulam nabi aaazaad, ajay maakan jaise tamaam netaa the jo sarkaar or sanghathan donon main the
 Azad is still the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha in the same episode and also the General Secretary in charge of the party UP
 isiilie mana ja rahaa he ki, rahul raaj main unako bhi ek pad chhodana hoga
 12
 party se baahar ke telent ko bhi maukarahul raaj main party se baahar ke nae lekin telented logon ko jodne ke liye bhi kadam uthaae gaye
 This exercise was started to connect those who are experts in speaking and those who are considered close to the Congress ideology
 iske liye media vibhaag ne rajya-rajya jaakar intervyuu liye
 The effort is that people outside the Congress should also be made party spokespersons at the state, district level
 party adhyaksh ke taur par rahul ke ab tak ke kaarykaal ko dekha jaae to unhone siyaasi hawa ke rukh ko bhaanpate hue apane faisle liye hai
 Care was taken that the workers should also be pleased with their decisions
 lekin isi dauraan kuch aise faisle bhi liye gaye jo party kaaryakartaaon or netaaon kii samaj se pare rahe
 For example, in UP, the Congress candidate in Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-elections whose bail could not be saved
 iske alaava bispi se nikaale gaye nasimuddin siddiki ko party ke saath jodna, akhilesh yadav kii dukhati rag shivpal yadav se congress kaa sampark karnaa, iske baavjood samaajawaadee party-bispi se mahagathbandhan kii aas lagaana
 Along with this, Rahul's failure in the Youth Congress and the student organization of the party, NSUI, is also considered as a big failure
 party sanghathan main rahul loktantric tareeke se chunaav kii bahut duhai dete rahe hai, lekin tamaam koshishon ke baavjood rahul bhi sonia kii tarah hi apni congress varkig cameti (CWC) chunenge yani chunaav ke bina hi
 Still Rahul is taking care of many things
 jaldi faisle le rahe hai, lekin madhya pradesh main ab tak siem kaa cheharaa wo nahin tay kar paae
 The veteran Congress leader and former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijay Singh is currently on a 'religious pilgrimage'
 9 april ko unki yatra khatm hogi
 It is believed that the decision of MP is stalled
 rahul nahin chaahate ki, diggajon ko naaraaz kiya jaae
 However, Diggi Raja's rival camp has put full pressure on Rahul against Diggi
 bataa den ki sonia ke vakt kai baar aise logon ko rajyon kaa prabharee banaaya gaya jo us rajya kii bhashaa samaj bhi nahin pate the
 For example, PC Chacko of Kerala was put in charge of Delhi while Sonia was the president
 haalat ye thi ki kai baar dilli ke vidhansabha or nigam chunaavon main ummidavaaron ko angreji jaanane vaale ko saath le jaakar chaako se milanaa padataa tha
 Overall, a lot of things Rahul is doing apart from Sonia's style, fixing accountability
 lekin abhi bhi kai jagah ranneeti sonia vaali hi dikhti he
 As far as change is concerned, Rahul's success or failure will depend on what results his team gives on the ground and how energized the party worker is

 The court gave Gurumurthy a chance to present his apology after lunch, but he could not

 jahaan do scooter savaar ladakon ne ek sarerah ek ladki ke saath had darje kii badasluki kii or phir use lut kar faraar ho gaye
 The entire incident was captured in a CCTV camera installed there
 is vaardaat ko dekhne waalon ke hosh ud gaye
 The very next day of Rakshabandhan, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Vishwas Sarang attacked the Madhya Pradesh government and the Congress
 madhya pradesh kii rajdhani bhopal ke narela vidhansabha kshetra se vidhayak saarang ne shuukravaar ko mukhyamantri kamalnath kii aalochana kii or rahul gandhi samet nehru-gandhi parivaar kii bhi jamkar aalochana kii
 The BJP MLA said that there is no such evidence or photo in which Rahul Gandhi is seen tying Rakhi
 unhone kaha ki aisi koi tasviir kam se kam hamane to nahin dekhi
 Sarang also announced a reward for the one who brought a rakhi picture of priyanka-rahul
 saarang ne raksha bandhan ke avasar par kamalnath ke mahilaon se raakhi bandhavane par pratikriya vyakt karte hue kaha ki congress netaaon ko rakshabandhan se koi lenaa dena nahin
 These people follow the tradition of Italy
 rahul gandhi par diya vivaadit bayaanrakhi ke din mukhyamantri awaas kii feeki raunak ke liye kamalnath par hamalavar saarang ne gandhi parivaar ko bhi lapete main le liya
 He said that a similar picture will be seen if the leaders, who adopt Italy's customs, policy and culture, come to power
 saarang ne kaha ki rakshabandhan hinduon kii samskruti se judaa tyohaar he or isse mukhyamantri yaa congress ke netaaon ko kya lenaa dena? unhone kaha ki vah to keval vahi karenge jo sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi kahenge
 Significantly, during the rule of the BJP, there was a big event at the Chief Minister's residence when Shivraj Singh Chauhan was the Chief Minister
 badi sankhya main mahilaayein mukhyamantri awaas pahunchakar raakhi baandhti thim
 Chief Minister Kamal Nath also tied Rakhi, but neither was the event nor the excitement or enthusiasm
 ise lekar bijepi hamalavar he
 Two political stalwarts of Bihar, Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad have started to like each other
 donon netaa kai dinon sejanta dal parivarako ikattha karne main jute hue hai
 For this, there is talk of merging several parties like Mulayam Singh Yadav's Samajwadi Party and Janata Dal (secular) together
 khabar he ki is koshish ko amalijama pahanaate hue lalu prasad kii party argedy or bihar main sattadhari jediu kaa janvari ke ant tak vilay ho jayega
 Earlier, the Socialist Janata (democratic) of Kerala has merged with the Janata Dal
 jediu or argedy ke vilay se janata dal parivaar ke ek saath aakar ek sanyukt takat ke rup main ubharne kaa ek bahut mahatvapurn charan shuru ho jayega
 On 22 December, scattered members of the Janata Parivar at Delhi's Jantar Mantar, in a unified manner, sought Narendra Modi's account of his promises made during the election
 loksabhaa chunaav main mili haar ke baad sapa, argedy, INLD, jedy (es) or jediu ke saamne apana garh bachaane kii chunauti he
 However, if we look at the history of joining and disintegrating of the members of the Janata Parivar, then the path of the new 'samajwadi Janata Dal' looks difficult
 dilli main hui do baithkon ke baad sapa pramukh mulaayam singh yadav ko nae ekikrut dal ke praaroop kaa masauda taiyaar karne kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya he
 In such a situation, the question arises whether the new party will be able to present a challenge in front of the changed development-centric politics of the present central government
 The challenges of the new Samajwadi Janata Dal are also no less
 bharose kii kamigaiyr congresavad kii thisis par bane janata parivaar main kai baar tuutan ain
 Then several teams emerged and then broke up
 ye silsilaa itani baar ho chukaa he ki avam ke ek bade hisse ko bhi nahin pataa ki janata parivaar vaale kitni baar toote or bikhare
 Therefore, integrating Janata Dal is not a big issue in front of leaders like Mulayam Singh, Nitish Kumar and Lalu, the big challenge for them will be to raise public confidence for a unified new party
 koun karegaa nae dal kii aguwainarendra modi ke netritv vaali bijepi lagaataar rajya chunaavon main apni vijay pataakaa fahraati ja rahi he
 It has formed governments in Maharashtra and Haryana on its own
 jharkhand main bhi bijepi sarkaar ne shapath le lee he or jammu-kashmir main bhi bijepi duusari sabase badi party banakar ubhari he
 The question is also that if a new unified socialist Janata Dal emerges, then who will lead it
 kya mulaayam singh iske netaa honge
 Will the rest of the leaders be able to trust Mulayam Singh
 in sabhi dalon ko milakar dekha jaae to loksabhaa main inke sadasyon kii sankhya 15 he, jabaki rajyasabha main inaki sthiti thodi majboot dikhti he
 However, in political circles, Mulayam Singh is said to be the most non-trusted leader
 2014 ke chunaavon se pehle mulaayam upie sarkaar ke khilaaf kai baar muddon par alag gathjod banane ke baad palat gaye the, lekin ab centre main upie kii sarkaar nahin he or is baat kii sambhaavna kam he ki mulaayam bijepi ke saath jaaenge
 Among these, there is little possibility that Mulayam will work under the leadership of Nitish or any other leader, as well as the influence of these leaders outside UP and Bihar
 apane rajyon kii dasha nahin badal paaenjanta dal ke ahm sadasyon main se ek rahe lalu yadav ne bihar main 15 saal shashan kiya, lekin apane rajya kii sthiti badal paane main lalu naakaam rahe
 On the basis of the yadav-muslim equation, Lalu ruled for a long time, but these formulas will now work, it is difficult to say
 mulaayam singh yadav ke bete upi main purna bahumat kii sarkaar chalaa rahe hai or isse pehle mulaayam singh yadav bhi upi par shashan kar chuke hai
 But even today, electricity, water and road problems in UP and Bihar remain the same
 haalanki nitish kumaar ne in sabake mukaable behatar kaam kiya, lekin ek seemaa se aage vah bhi nahin ja paae
 These regional leaders who rule on the strength of Dalits, Minorities and Backwards in their respective states are on the slopes of age (except Nitish)
 unki raajnneeti kaa sarvshereshth samay biit chukaa he or desh kaa madhyam varg bahut aage bad chukaa he
 In politics, it seems impossible for these parties to have an alternative to Narendra Modi without new thinking and policy in a time dominated by GDP rather than bread
 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye somvaar ko chauthe phej kii voting ke dauraan mumbai main tamaam filmi sitaron ne vot daale

 " Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray said on Thursday that underworld don Dawood Ibrahim wants to come to India
 thakare ne kaha ki bhartiya janata party daaud ko bharat laakar 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main iskaa phayda uthaanaa chaahati he
 On Thursday, Raj Thackeray joined Facebook and addressed people through Facebook Live
 is dauraan raaj thakare bole ki bijepi ne japani pradhanmantri shinjo abe kaa istemaal gujarat chunaav ke liye kiya
 On Dawood's return, Raj said that Dawood is ill now, he wants to come to India and take his last breath here
 ye daaud kii ichha he lekin bijepi ise aisa darshaaegi ki ye unki uplabdhi ho
 Thackeray said that the BJP will say that Congress has not caught Dawood in so many years but our government has caught him
 lekin aisa nahin he balki vah khud bharat aana chahta he
 Dawood's brother was arrested recently, tell you that recently, Thane Crime Branch arrested Dawood's brother Iqbal Kaskar
 ikbaal kaskar par ek builder ko ugaahi ke liye dhamkee dene kaa aarope he
 According to sources, some people of Iqbal Kaskar gang had threatened a builder on a phone call and demanded a ransom from him

 In the face of Telangana, of course the country has got the 29th state today
 lekin baaki saare 28 rajyon kii baat karen to shaayad hi koi shahar yaa kasbaa aisa ho, jahaan maa, bahan yaa beti kii aabru naa luti ho
 Badaun is in the headlines, Delhi was in the headlines
 dilli kii tarah kuch din baad badaayun bhi shant ho jayega, kyonki aisa to hota rahata he
 
 
 Police breathing with oxygen from Bayhaye
 bechaargi kii aabo-hawa ke bich ukhdati saanson ko sambhaal kar kisi tarah jinda rahane kii jaddojehad karata kanoon
 Opposition leaders also trade issues such as rape between the government doing cheap acts in the arrogance of power and the flattery of staying away from power
 or in sabake bich aam ke ped se jhulati hindustan kii aabru
 Is it time to celebrate whether the struggle over Telangana has been successful for years or is it a time of shame
 afsos hota he ki rape jaise sharmnaak jurm ko rokane kii bajaae satta par kabiz log rape kii ulul-julul vajahen talashte hai, jabaki vipaksh ise mudda banaakar do-chaar din ke liye apni raajnneetik dukaan chamkaati he
 Then all disappeared
 sab khamosh
 After forgetting everything, everyone lurks in their political palaces

 Then scream, then shout and then lean down
 yahi to hota rahaa he
 This has been happening so far and this is happening
 kya ham bhul gaye vah taarikh- 16 disambar, dillido saal pehle ke 16 disambar ke baad kaa gussa koun bhula paaya he? tab kitni badi-badi baaten kii gayi thim

 Along with the boiling of the country, it was for the first time that it wanted to trust its leaders
 lekin kya hua in baton, vaadon or sapanom kaa? tab dilli kii tapish ne puure desh ko tapa diya tha
 This was a movement whose voice could not be ignored, because it was not of any leader, organization or party but of the common Indians
 kya yahi hamaara hindustan he?badaayun ke ek gaanv main aam ke ped se lataki do bahanon kii laashen or isse pehle unke saath jo kuch hua, vah yah bataane ke liye kaaphi hai ki 16 disambar ke baad kaa hindustan kaisaa he? ye aaazaad hindustan kii hi tasviir he
 Probably something similar foreign tourists come to India and find in India

 do saal dhai maheene pehle lakhanu kii gaddi par jab akhilesh yadav kabiz hue to laga tha ki baaki chizon ke saath-saath upi main jurm kii surat bhi badalegi
 Surat also changed
 lekin acchhee hone kii bajaae or bighad gai
 Let's roam somewhere from one edge to the other edge of this biggest state of the country, the picture of crime will look the same
 afsos tab hota he jab jurm rokane kii bajaae lakhanu ke nakkaarkaane se sirf baaten hi sunai detii hai
 Those who should work properly, they are just talking
 reporter ne bas itnaa hi poocha tha ki upi main mahilaayein surakshit nahin hai
 Instead of listening to the Chief Minister, taunting the female reporter, he sat and asked - there is no danger to you
 jaraa in haal kii ghatnaon par gaur kiijie-upi me rape ke baad ladki ko tejaab pilayaupi me 10 saal kii bacchee ke saath repupi main maansik rup se biimaar bacchee ke saath balaatkaarupi main gaanv ke andar gangarapeupi main rape ke baad jinda jalaane kii koshishaye tamaam tasviren isi naa badalane vaale rajya kii takadir kii sabase badi gavaah he
 If someone is being fed acid after the rape, then someone is being strangled and burned alive
 das saal kii bacchee ke saath kahin balaatkaar ho rahaa he to chalis saal kii mahilaayein bhi mahfuj nahin he akhilesh ji ke upi main
 Will Hindustanbadayun take a lesson from Badaun, everyone saw Delhi's anger on December 16 and that December
 dhai maheene pehle hi akhilesh sarkaar ko lakhanu kii gaddi par kabiz hue do saal puure ho chuke hai
 The first promise was to change the picture of crime in the state
 unke rajya ke pehle saal main hi teen hajaar se zyada murder, hajaar ke kareeb rape, hajaar se zyada kidnaping or chaar hajaar se zyada lut ke maamle hue
 In the second year between January 2013 and January 2014, 9500 cases of rape, attempted rape and other crimes related to women were registered in the state
 yani mahilaon ke khilaaf hone vaale aparaadh ke maamalon main pichley saal ke mukaable 50 fisadi kaa ijapha hua he
 According to the latest statistics of 10 bureaucratic crime records in UP every day, an average of ten cases of rape are reported in UP every day
 ek or chaunkaane vaala sach yah he ki upi main 60 se 65 fisadi rape ke maamle amuman subah-subah yaa shaam ko tab hote hai jab mahilaayein khule main shouch ke liye jaati hai
 Open because the village does not have toilet facilities in the houses
 badaayun main donon bahanon ke saath bhi rape tabhi hua tha jab donon shaam ko khule main shouch ke liye ja rahi thim
 The world's trouble is the mental mentality of rape, not any one state or country but the oldest problem in the whole world
 khaastaur par hamaara samaaj jis soch ke saath apane mardon kii parvarish kar rahaa he usamen darindagi kaa yah alam he ki ek saal kii maasoom se lekar 90 saal tak kii bujurg aurat tak rape kaa shikaar ho rahi he
 Obviously, our attitude is behind all this
 wo najariya jo maa ke pair main jananath dekhtaa he, bahan kii hifaazat kii raakhi bandhavata he lekin beti ko maar daalata he
 The woman understands the bus and the thing used
 jarurat he ki is najariya ko badla jaae
 At the same time, there is a need to change the politics of leaders
 varna aise badaayun naa jane kitne shahar or kasbe main milte rahenge

 india kii most popular mahilaon ke naam agar aapse puche jaaen, to aap shaayad indira gandhi or sarojini naidu ko hi list main top par rakhenge
 Even after independence, when there was a stamp of male dominated society on the country, it was necessary for women to enter the politics of the country first to wash it
 jab desh ko chalaane vaali mahilaayein aatmavishvaas se bhari hon, tabhi desh kii baaki mahilaayein bhi garv se apane liye ek achche bhavishya kaa sapana dekh sakati hai
 Women like Indira Gandhi and Sarojini Naidu gave the same dreaming path to all girls in the country
 yah kranti jo unhone shuru kii, uski aag din par din bad hi rahi he
 Today, on March 8, while celebrating International Women's Day, we introduce you to some of the special faces of India that the world salutes today: If we start from the sky, Kalpana Chawla's name comes first in the world
 antariksh main jane vaali pehali bhartiya mahila ke rup main kalpana ne 1997 main spes shatal colombia main udaan bhari thi
 He lost his life in an accident on 1 February 2003 in the space shuttle Columbia, but gave inspiration to countless girls in the world to dream high
 sirf aasmaan main udana hi nahin, balki hamaare desh kii ladakiyon ne hawa ko chirate hue aage badhane kaa haunsala bhi diya he
 Considered the queen of Indian track and field, PT Usha was also awarded with names like 'payyoli Express' and 'sunhari Pari'
 bataate hai ki ushaa jaisi athlet koi duusari paidaa hi nahin hui he
 Mary Kom's name has grown quite rapidly over the years
 boxing ko jahaan sirf ladakon kaa khel mana jaataa tha, vahaan mairi com ne padam bhushan paakar is khel ko nai disha di he, or tamaam ladakiyon ko ek nayaa sapana
 In the same badminton, as much as Saina Nehwal's achievements are mentioned
 star badminton khilaadi sina nehwal ne ek ke baad ek kai khitaab apane naam kar sabit kar diya he ki desh main khel keval purush hi nahin mahilaayein bhi oonchaaiyon ko chhu sakati hai
 Kiran Bedi is another excellent example of courage, passion and ability
 bharat kii pehali ipies officer ke rup main kiran ne soshal justise kaa sachcha rup ham sabake saamne rakhaa
 Not only this, there are some women who have put locks on the mouths of those people who had the illusion that girls are raw
 isiaisiai bank kii siio chanda kochar, neshnal stock exange kii head chitra ramkrishna, exis bank kii siio shikha sharma, echesbisi kii president or country head naina laal kidawai or yas bank kii bijness manager raakhi kapur ne apni mehnat se sabko hilaakar rakh diya
 Not only in banking, but also in all business, Indian women have worn flags
 bioxon kii chairman or managing diarector kiran majumdaar shah ne 566 million dollar ke revenue ke saath bioxon ko asia kii sabase badi biopharma bana diya
 And also got herself registered as India's richest woman with assets of Rs 2000 crores
 yahi nahin, britania industries kii managing diarector vineeta bali, godarej industries kii predicent nisaba godarej, bisalari group kii diarector jayanti chouhan, aadi ne dikhaa diya ki ladkiyaan acchhee manager bhi sabit ho sakati hai
 You also cannot deny that women are not broken even in the entertainment world
 vidya baalan, deepika padukon, priyanka chopra or karina kapur khan se lekar farha khan or ekta kapur tak koi bhi kisi se kam nahin he
 This list is not going to end

 Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut has claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered to include NCP Chief Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule in his cabinet
 party ke mukhpatr 'saamana' main chape ek lekh main raut ne sharad pavaar ke saath ek mulaakaat ke bare main bataaya
 He asked Sharad Pawar about the media reports that said Pawar would join Modi's cabinet
 raut ne likhaa, 'pavaar ne mujhase kaha ki media main ai khabaron main koi sachai nahin he
 He described such reports as the extent of stupidity
 ' unhone daawa kiya ki pavaar ne kaha, 'meri party ke bare main afvaah failaai ja rahi hai
 Modi once told me that he wanted to include Supriya in his cabinet
 us baithak main maujuud supriya ne modi se kaha ki vah bijepi main shaamil hone vaali antim vyakti hongi
 Rumor is also being spread
 Pawar also told him that ncp's stance is clear, yet rumor is being spread to create confusion
 unhone kaha, 'sharad pavaar yah kehete hai, lekin ensipi ke aise varisht netaa bhi hai jo (maharashtra ke) mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ke sampark main hai
 There is no cause for concern for the Shiv Sena, whether the NCP wants to join the Fadnavis cabinet or the Chief Minister holding secret meetings with NCP leaders
 'bataa den ki ensipi pramukh ke ek kareebi sahyogi ne kaha ki vah apnegrihnagar baraamati main hanore uchit samay par saamana ke lekh kaa jawaab denge

 lekin usne ani ko choda bhi nahin he
 Speaking to Australian Times, Annie said, 'I want to sleep with men from Poland, Europe and the whole world
 mujhe sex, maje karnaa or mard pasand hai
 Sex is still a taboo subject in Poland, and if someone wants to satisfy their sex hunger, they are considered a perverted mindset
 ’haalanki, ani ke anusaar vah apane is mishan ko sirf saptaahant par hi puraa karne kii koshish karegi
 Annie has also created a website and Facebook page to fulfill her mission where she tells about her adventures
 ek mard ke saath vah kitna samay bithaayengi? is sawaal ke jawaab par wo kahati hai ki har ek partner ke saath kareeb 20 minute
 But, there is a strong twist in the story here
 or vah twist yah he ki kuch reportron kaa maananaa he ki yah ani kii taraf se sirf ek afvaah ho sakati he
 According to him, if Annie left for food and gold and engaged in the same work, then she should take about 3 to complete her mission
 8 saal lag jaaenge
 And it will take about 20 years according to his desire to complete his mission on the same week

 Shailendra Pandey - Astrologer saal 1989
 Ranbheri of Lok Sabha elections was over
 madhya pradesh kii indore seat par muqabla kariban ekatarfa mana ja rahaa tha, kyonki ek taraf rajya ke mukhyamantri or desh ke grahamantri rahe congress ke kaddavar netaa prakashchandra sethi maidan main the, to duusari taraf bijepi ne yuva sumitra mahajan (sumitra Mahajan) ko maidan main utaara tha
 The 46-year-old Sumitra Mahajan did not have any special experience in politics, but she knew how to do things in her favor
 jab chunaav ke nattejey aae to sabhi dang rah gaye
 In fact, in the 1989 Lok Sabha elections Sumitra Mahajan raised the issue of local versus outsider loudly
 unhone kaha, main indore kii bahu hum isaliye 'indore kii chaabi' mujhe milani chahie
 Since defeating Prakashchandra Sethi in 1989, 75-year-old Sumitra Mahajan has been representing Indore continuously, but this time the Congress is powering to snatch the 'key of Indore' from them, even within the BJP itself
 
 ek tarah congress kah rahi he ki, 'itihaas is baat kaa gavaah he ki agar koi bujurg chaabi chhodane ko taiyaar nahin hota he, to uske naati-pote usase chaabi chin lete hai'
 On the other hand, Kailash Vijayvargiya, the bjp's strong leader in Madhya Pradesh, seems to be beating himself up from Indore seat
 yani sumitra mahajan kii raah kathin dikh rahi he

 At some places the film will laugh but the story and screenplay are weak, longer than necessary, there are many gimmicks in many places
 shahid or aalia kii shandaar jodi agar dekhnaa chaahate hai to ek baar aap dekh sakate hai
 If you do not watch the film, you will not miss, because i gave 4 stars to Vikas Bahl's film 'queen' and 2 to it
 5 star de rahaa hum to aap andaaza laga sakate hai ki kitna fark he donon filmon main
 After Vikas Bahl's 'queen' and Chillar Party, we had high expectations from 'fantastic', which the film did not live up to
 kahin-kahin film hansaaegi magar kahani or screenple kamazor he, jarurat se zyaada lambii, kai jagah dher sari nautanki he
 If you want to see a fantastic pair of Shahid and Alia, then you can see once
 agar film nahin bhi dekhenge to kuch miss nahin karenge, kyonki vikaas bahal kii film 'queen' ko maine 4 star die the or ise 2
 Giving 5 stars, you can guess how much difference there is between the two films
 shahid or aalia kii shandaar jodi agar dekhnaa chaahate hai to ek baar aap dekh sakate hai
 If you do not watch the film, you will not miss, because i gave 4 stars to Vikas Bahl's film 'queen' and 2 to it
 5 star de rahaa hum to aap andaaza laga sakate hai ki kitna fark he donon filmon main
 The case of suspected death of Himanshi, daughter-in-law of BSP MP Narendra Kashyap, is getting complicated
 saansad ke bade bete dow
 The corpse of Sagar Kashyap's wife, Himani, was found in the bathroom of his house but no one could hear the sound of firing
 gajiabad police ne praathmik jaanch ke baad jo jaankaree di he, usase maamla or bhi zyada ulajhata dikh rahaa he
 Police say the mp's elder son, Dr
 sagar kashyap aurahimanshiki shaadi 2013 main hui thi
 Now they also have an 18-month-old baby
 police ke mutabik vaardaat kii subah yani buudhvaar ko subah saadhe saat baje dow
 Sagar Kashyap left home to go to Subharti Medical College
 vah vahaan se micro biology main emdi kar rahe hai
 Subharti College is located on the Meerut Bypass
 police ne bataaya ki dow
 After Sagar left, 6 people were present in the house
 jinamein khud saansad narendra kashyap, unki patni or unki choti beti shobhaa ke alaava teen rishtedaar monu, ashish or sachin maujuud the
 The family claims that they were all on the ground floor of the house while Himanshi was in her bedroom on the first floor
 uske kamare ke darwaja khulaa hua tha lekin bathroom andar se band tha
 At around eleven thirty in the morning, Sachin went to the room to see Himanshi but he did not open the bathroom door
 uske baad monu vahaan aayaa lekin tab bhi himani ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 Then another relative also reached there
 tab monu ne jor se laat markar darwaja tod diya
 In the bathroom, Himanshi's blood-soaked corpse lay on her stomach
 parivaar waalon kaa daawa he ki unhone koi shor yaa gan chalane kii awaz nahin suni
 They panicked and went straight to Himani with a private hospital
 police kaa kahana he ki vahiin ke doctoron ne ghatana kii jaankaree police ko di
 Police said that Himanshi's parents were also in Ghaziabad yesterday
 ve kashyap jayanti ke liye yahaan aae hue the
 Yesterday i
e
 around 9 o'clock on Tuesday night, they left from there
 ghatana kii jaankaree milane ke baad kareeb dopaher ek baje police saansad ke ghar pahunchi
 The police noticed that the whole bathroom saw blood but the revolver was placed on a rack
 ise ek rishtedaar ne police ke hawaale kiya
 It was a licensed revolver, licensed by Himanshi's husband, Dr
 sagar kashyap ke naam par he
 It is a 32 bore license revolver made in Ordinance
 jaanch ke dauraan bathroom yaa kamare se koi suicide note nahin mila
 The surprising thing is that Himanshi died of a bullet in the head but did not hear the sound of firing from any person present in the house
 himanshi ke pita bhi aspataal pahunch gaye hai
 police is investigating the case
 vishwa hindu parishad (viechpi) ke netaa praveen togadiya ne phir jehar ugala he
 After the violence in the Baltal camp of Amarnath, he has threatened the minorities in a very objectionable tone
 shanivaar ko unhone kaha ki musalmaan 2002 ke gujarat dange bhale hi bhul gaye hon, lekin pichley saal ke mujffarnagar dange unhen jarur yaad honge
 According to the news, he gave an example of Ramayana and said, "if you set fire to Hanuman's tail, Lanka will burn
" ' gauratlab he ki amarnath yatra ke baltaal aadhaar shivi main suraksha balon or pradarshnakariyon ke bich hui jhadap main 40 log ghayal ho gaye the
 According to the news published in a newspaper, Togadia's words were, 'you may have forgotten Gujarat, but you will remember Muzaffarnagar
 ' togadiya ne indore main ek press conference ke dauraan yah baat kahi
 Ashok Singhal had also given a disputed statement that Togadia said that Gujarat riots occurred after the Godhra incident, while Muzaffarnagar incident also happened after the alleged molestation of a Hindu girl
 togadiya ne baltaal shivi kii hinsa ke liye pradesh kii umr abdulla sarkaar ko jimmedaar bataaya
 Two days earlier, VHP leader Ashok Singhal had indirectly threatened Muslims
 unhone kaha tha ki alpsankhyak samudaay ko hinduon kii bhaawanaaon kaa sammaan karnaa siikhnaa hoga, varanaa ve lambey samay tak vajood main nahin rah paaenge
 'AAP spokesperson arrested, not Togadia' JDU President Sharad Yadav strongly condemned the statements of Ashok Singhal and Togadia
 poster vivaad par AAP pravaktaa dilip pandey kii giraftaar kaa zikr karte hue unhone kaha, 'ye sarkaar vikaas or achche din laane kii baat kar rahi thi
 They arrested the people of Aam Aadmi Party, but these people are making such statements

 The report of the Central Water Commission is warning about the falling water level of the dams and reservoirs, and the rainfall during the cold season has not been halved
 garmi ke maheene aane vaale hai
 Water crisis has started appearing in many states including the capital Delhi, Gujarat, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh
 pichley hafte jari ayog kii report bataati he ki desh ke baandhon, talabon or nadi kshetron (river basin) main jalastr gir rahaa he
 In the case of dams and ponds, this decline has gone below the 10-year average
 baandhon or jalaashyon kaa jalastr 63
 59 BCM (billion cubic meters)
 yah pichley 10 saal ke ausat 69
 It is also running below 76 BCM which is 39%
 15 farvari se pehle ke hafte main yah 41 fisadi tha
 The water level in 35 of the country's 91 reservoirs is below normal
 narmada, sabarmati, tapi, godavari, krishna nadi basin main bhi pani das saal ke ausat se neeche chalaa gaya he
 Water scarcity is increasing in areas of these river basins
 himalay se nikalne vaali nadiyon main farvari ke duusare hafte main hui barish or barfbaari se raahat he
 Why are the monsoon rains facing this shortage despite the government figures being normal? Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist at Skymet, a company that analyzes weather data, says that between June and September, 96 to 104 per cent of rainfall is considered normal
 2017 main saamaanya se ek fisadi kam (95) barish hona koi bahut kharaab baat nahin
 This time it did not rain everywhere
 gujarat main saamaanya se 19 fisadi or rajasthan main 8 fisadi zyada barish hui
 This figure looks better but it has no benefit on the ground
 baadh ai or pani samudr main chalaa gaya
 Apart from this, there was less rainfall during monsoon in all areas, due to which water crisis has started there
 uttar pradesh, haryana, dilli, punjab or madhya pradesh main saamaanya se 20 se 30 fisadi tak kam barish hui he
 Jharkhand
 himachal pradesh, bihar or chhattisgarh main saamaanya se kareeb 10 fisadi kam pani barasaa he
 Apart from the monsoon, this time the rainfall has also reduced in winter
 2018 main to farvari ke pehle pakhwaade tak saamaanya se 58 fisadi kam barish hui he jo ki sookhe jaise halaat kaa ek bada kaaran he
 The scientists of Noida's National Medium Term Weather Forecasting Center are also saying that the weather will be dry for the time being
 ab dhire-dhire taapmaana badhegaa
 On the other hand, Palawat says that in the coming days, there is no hope of rain
 kisi tarah kaa koi system banataa nahin dikh rahaa
 The temperature will rise in the next two-three months, which causes the water crisis to become stronger
 pani ke morche par monsoon se pehle raahat kaa koi sanket nahin he
 "there is a scarcity of water in parts of Vidarbha and Marathwada," says Raju Shetty, president of Swabhimani Paksha, a political party in Maharashtra
 haa, pichley saal jaisi sthiti nahin he kyonki monsooni barish thik rahi
 Due to the scorching heat in the state, it becomes difficult with the first scare of May
 lekin pradesh ke sabhi shaharon or gaanvon main peyajal kaa sankat dikhne laga he
 "things may worsen in the coming days in Shetty, Jalna, Osmanabad and Beed
" lekin gujarat main halaat zyada kharaab hai
 Here Madhya Pradesh has started impeding the Narmada water supply because it wants to ensure the supply of its state first
 is baar gujarat kaa haal abhi se behaal he
 There, 40 percent of the rain water flows into the sea
 pradesh main pani or swatchta ke kshetra main sakriy enjio pravaah ke sanyojak nitin thakur bataate hai, yahaan pani kaa mukhya jariya sardaar sarovar project hi he
 Due to this, 131 cities and 53 percent villages of the state supply drinking water, but due to less rainfall in Madhya Pradesh, the water in Narmada is very less
 is kaaran is saal gujarat ko tay 90 lakh acre foot pani kaa 45 pratishat yani kareeb 47 lakh acre foot pani hi mil sakegaa
 Apart from this, irrigation and industry also have to be supplied water
 jaahir he, garmi main yahaan halaat bahut kharaab hone kaa andeshaa he
 Water scarcity has already started in the cities of Madhya Pradesh
 bhartiya mausam vibhaag ke purv mahanideshak lakshmana singh rathod kaa kahana he ki jalaashyon main zyaadaatar pani monsoon ke dauraan hi aata he
 The rate of transpiration increases considerably during the summer season and consumption also accelerates
 jalaashyon ke pani se sinchai or shaharon ko aapurti bad rahi he
 Its rate is also increasing
 himalay ke glacier sikud rahe hai or yah bhi taapmaana badaae ke kaaran ho rahaa he
 Summer has increased from year to year for the last 18 years
 taapmaana badaae kaa yah kram is saal bhi jari rahegaa
 "traditionally, water scarcity persists in some parts of the country every year," says Rathore
 pathari bhaag yani karnataka se marathavada or telugana tak, tamilnadu kaa ek bada ilaaka jisamen chennai bhi shaamil he or madhya rajasthan main har saal sookhe jaise halaat paidaa hote hai
 "in 2018, when the water crisis of South African city of Cape Town was discussed in the world, then the water crisis of Karnataka's Rajdhanu Bangalore also got a lot of headlines
 pichley 15 saal se desh kii nadiyon or jalaashyon ko kareeb se dekh chuke jalpurush rajendra singh kaa kahana he, ''pani ke maamle main hamaare desh kaa har shahar capatoun he
 Now we bring water to cities from a distance of a hundred kilometers or less
 lekin ab nadiyon ke sookhne se itani dur se bhi laana mushkil ho gaya he
 In the case of water crisis in Cape Town, someone has reached the last man in the media as a strategy
 ’’ rajendra singh kehete hai, bade baandhon ke kaaran bharat main aazaadee ke baad sookhaa 10 guna bad gaya he
 Because of this, water does not reach the ends of the canal and battles have started over water
 kaveri vivaad jaise jhagade isaki misaal hai
 There may be politics behind this, but it is certain that the coming three months of summer will take the water test

 isse pehle bhi unke bich jhagada hua tha

 ek samay tha jab mayawati ke janmdin kaa matlab hota tha dhooma dham, jalsa, raily, kek or kabhi kabhaar noton kii maala bhi
 But now Mayawati celebrates her birthday with simplicity to get rid of controversies
 mangalvaar ko unka 57waan janmdin tha or jise bispi ne jan kalyaan diwas ke naam se manaaya
 There was neither cake, no drums nor any kind of spectacle, Mayawati celebrated her birthday in a hotel in Delhi with the release of a book she had written
 bispi ke log is kitaab ko bispi kii balu book kehete hai
 The occasion was birthday but sweetness was missing from Mayawati's statements
 kai baar upie sarkaar kii najuk maukon par madad karne vaali mayawati ne sarkaar ke khilaaf jamkar zehar ugala
 Mayawati said that this government is not only engulfed in corruption but is also taking decisions that hurt the common people one after the other
 mayawati ne railway kiraye badhotaree se lekar deazal kii keemton main badhotaree or alpiji kaa kota kam karne kii bhi jamkar aalochana
 But when she was asked that if this government is so bad, why is she supporting it, then Mayawati did not give a direct answer
 mayawati ne vipaksh bijepi ko bhi nahin bakhsha or kaha ki uske netaa dishaheen hai
 But he was shocked that by saying that if the bjp's situation were good, many constituents of the UPA would have come to the NDA by now
 mayawati kii nazar ab lok sabha chunaav par lagi he or wo ummid kar rahi he ki uttar pradesh se aise nattejey aaenge ki wo centre kii raajnneeti main nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaa sakengi
 So far, Mayawati has saved the life of the UPA government on many delicate occasions, but it is clear from her attitude that in the coming times, she does not necessarily help the Congress
 glen maxwell lagaataar tisare match main shatak se chook gaye, lekin gendbaajon kii bedard dhunaai karne kii unki muhim or lakshmipathi balaji kii asardaar gendbaaji se kings ilevan punjab ne ipel saat ke ekatarfa match main mangalvaar ko shahjah main sunrisers hyderabad par 72 ran kii badi jeet se apana vijay abhiyaan jari rakhaa
 Luck was also supported by Maxwell twice and he took full advantage of it and played a stormy innings of 95 off 43 balls which included five fours and nine sixes
 cheteshwar pujaara (32 gend par 35 ran) or virendra sahvaag (22 gend par 30 ran) ne pehle wicket ke liye 51 ran jodakar majboot neenv rakhi
 With this, Kings XI Punjab scored 193 runs for six wickets after being invited to bat first
 iske jawaab main sunrisers hyderabad kii team shuru main ladkadaa gai or aakhir main 19
 Stacked for 121 runs in 2 overs
 uski taraf se lokesh rahul ne sarvaadhik 27 ran banaaye
 Balaji showed amazing bowling and took four wickets for 13 runs in four overs
 akshar patel or mishael janson ne do-do wicket lekar unka acha saath diya
 This is Kings xi's third consecutive win and topped the table with six points
 sunrisers ko lagataar duusari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Maxwell had scored 95 and 89 runs in the last two matches
 vah mahela jayavardhane ke baad tii-20 main lagaataar teen pariyon 80 se adhik ran banane vaale duusare ballebaaj ban gaye
 For Sunrisers fast bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar took three wickets for 19 runs in four overs
 leg spinner amit mishra ne do wicket liye lekin iske liye unhone 56 ran lutaae
 Of these, 36 runs came off the bat of Maxwell alone
 balaji kii kone leti gend ne finch kaa wicket jhakzora jabaki warner ne point par khadey maxwell ko kaich thamaya
 Sandeep Sharma's exact ball y Venugopal Rao (11) was uprooted
 akshar patel ne irfan pathan (5) ko bold karke score paanch wicket par 74 ran kar diya
 Rahul held one end but Daromdar was on big hitter Darren Sammy (15)
 unhone patel kii long aan par chah ran ke liye bheji lekin balaji kii gend par apekshit oonchai kaa shaat nahin laga paae or patel ne kaich lekar sunrisers kii dhundhlee si ummid bhi khatm kar di
 Earlier, Sehwag scored a quick run in the powerplay before being dismissed, while Pujara, who scored an unbeaten 40 despite holding one end to the end in the previous match, also made some attractive shots including three fours in an over from Dale Steyn
 Huh
 mishra ne sahvaag ke rup main sunrisers ko pehali safalataa dilaai jinhone apni pari main do chauke or teen chakke lagaae
 He completed the half-century off just 21 balls, sending Karn Sharma for six off the next over
 bhagya ne iske baad bhi unka saath diya or saimi kii jis gend par deep midwicket par unka kaich lapka gaya vah nobal nikal gayi
 He celebrated it with Sammy hitting a six and a four in the same over
 kings ilevan ne is bich chaar over main 66 ran batore
 David Miller (10) did not last till today, but Maxwell's dream of returning unbeaten too could not be fulfilled
 pari ke 18wein over main mishra par do chakke jadne ke baad unhone long aaf khadey saimi ko kaich kaa abhyaas karaayaa
 In this way, the wait for Maxwell's first century in T20 still remains
 unke out hone ke kaaran kings ilevan aakhri do over main keval 14 ran bana paaya

 This was followed by GDP growth in the second quarter (july-september) of 6 in November
 3 fisadi ho gai
 These figures for the second quarter brought relief to the central government as the growth rate figures in the first quarter were at a 13-quarter low
 yah giravat desh main aarthik sudhaaron kii disha main badhate kadamon ke kaaran aanki gai
 Thus, the growth rate in the second quarter to go above 6 percent and again in the third quarter to cross the 7 percent rate of growth is showing that the central government is expecting better economic growth than expected in the current financial year
 kya khatm ho rahi aarthik sustigrowth ke aankade saaf dikhaa rahe hai ki bhartiya arthvyavastha ke achche dinon kii shuruyaat ho rahi he

 The other important area is agriculture, in which 4

 Therefore, it is clear from the GDP figures that both construction and agriculture, which are important for new jobs in the country, are doing better than expected and these areas will see good momentum in the coming days

 arunachal pradesh main brahmos kii tainaati ko lekar china kii chetavanee ko darkinar karte hue bhartiya sena ne spasht kiya he ki uske faisle beijing se tay nahin honge
 Highly placed army sources told NDTV, "our security concerns are our own and it is within our own jurisdiction to decide what kind of deployment we can make in our area
" ' According to the Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily, the deployment of brahmos along the border with China will have a negative impact on regional stability
 vaise abhi arunachal main brahmos kii tainaati hui bhi nahin he lekin china kii aapatti saamne aa gai he
 At present, the government has taken a decision that the fourth regiment of brahmos will be deployed in Arunachal
 kareeb 4,300 karod kii laagat se regiment main kareeb 100 misile, paanch mobile swachaalit launture or ek mobile kaman post tainaat hogi
 Its deployment will take about a year
 vaise brahmos kii range 290 kilometre he lekin china ke ghabaraane kii vajah he ki is missile kaa uske paas koi tod nahin he
 India has brahmos supersonic ie its speed is around one kilometer per second, while China has missile subsonic ie its speed is 290 meters per second
 aam bhashaa main samajhe to brahmos chini missile se teen guna tej he or ise fire karne main vakt bhi kam lagata he
 Also, it does not miss its target
 tippaniyan After its deployment, it will be accessible everywhere within the radius of 290 km from Arunachal Pradesh to China
 yahaan unnat brahmos kii tainaati hogi jo pahaado main chupe dushman ke thikaanon ko bhi nishaanaa bana saktaa he

 Although Brahmos has not been deployed in Arunachal yet, the objection of China has come to the fore
 philhal sarkaar ne is aashay kaa faisla bhar liya he ki arunachal main brahmos kii chauthi regiment kii tainaati hogi
 Around 100 missiles, five mobile automatic launchers and one mobile command post will be deployed in the regiment at a cost of about Rs 4,300 crore
 isaki tainaati main kareeb salbhar kaa vakt lag jayega
 Although brahmos has a range of 290 km, there is no reason for China to panic that the missile has no break
 bharat ke paas maujuud brahmos supersonic he yani isaki speed kareeb ek kilometre prati second he, jabaki china ke paas maujuud missile sabsonic yani uski speed 290 meter prati second he
 If understood in common language, brahmos is three times faster than Chinese missile and it takes less time to fire
 saath hi iskaa nishaanaa chukta nahin he
 The comments isaki tainaati ke baad arunachal pradesh se china ke 290 kilometre ke daayre main aane vaali har jagah isaki pahunch main hogi
 It will also deploy advanced brahmos which can also target enemy hideouts in the mountains
 chini sena ke mutabik brahmos kii tainaati se china ke tibet or unnan praant khatre kii jad main aa jaaenge

 ise pandubbi, yudhpot, ladaaku vimaan aadi se daaga ja saktaa he
 After its deployment, it will be accessible everywhere within the radius of 290 km from Arunachal Pradesh to China
 yahaan unnat brahmos kii tainaati hogi jo pahaado main chupe dushman ke thikaanon ko bhi nishaanaa bana saktaa he
