 baharhaal, micromax ne bharat go smartphone kii keemat or spacifications kaa khulaasa nahin kiya he
 However, due to the Android Go, it is expected that this smartphone will be low budget
 android go plateform kaa nirmaan pehali baar smartphone yuj vaale karne vaale yugers ko behatar anubhav dene ke liye kiya gaya he

 Smartphone battery is its major problem, no matter what smartphone you use, if you use it continuously, you will hardly run for a day
 har jagah aapako power socket to milenge nahin
 Therefore, power bank has become very important for the people
 ise phul charge karke aap apane mobile yaa tablet ko do yaa teen baar charge kar sakate hai
 Thousands of power banks are available in the market and on e-commerce websites
 lekin inamen se zyaadaatar yaa to aapke smartphone kharaab karte hai yaa khud hi kharaab ho jate hai
 In such a situation, when you go to buy power, keep some things in mind
 ham aapako kuch behtareen power banks ke bare main bhi bataaenge jinhen lene ke baad aapako pachhataanaa nahin padegaa
 Size - First of all, decide how you want to use Power Bank
 agar ghar yaa daftar main rakhkar yuj karnaa chaahate hai to aap bade sies kaa le sakate hai
 But if you have to keep it in your pocket or move around, then you have to take a small and light power bank
 bydaree power -bazaar main 1,000mah se lekar 20,000mah ke power bank maujuud hai
 You first check how many mah your smartphone battery is
 aamtaur par smartfones kii batariyaan 2,000mah se 4,000 mah kii hoti hai
 If you have a smartphone with a 3,000 mah battery then do not take a power bank of less than 10,000mah
 10,000mah se zyada vaale power bank ke jariye aap ise 2 baar se zyada apane mobile ko phul charge kar sakate hai
 Brand-power bank can directly harm your smartphone, so buy a power bank of a good company
 yah sunishchit kar len usamen lagi bydaree acchhee quality kii he
 Safety Protection - There will be news of battery burst, so before taking the power bank, please check the certification given in it
 imame temprechar protection, short circuit protection, riset protection, input over voltage protection, adeptor protection, reverse diarect protection or output over hit protection shaamil hai
 Fast charging option - Now quick charge support is also being provided in the power bank
 haalankiyah mahange hote hai, lekin agar aapako smartphone kii bydaree jaldi charge kerani he to quick charge saport vaala hi power bank khariden
 Multiple Connector - If you want to charge more than one device at a time, buy a power bank with two USB connectors
 zyaadaatar power bank main sirf ek yuasabi conector die jate hai
 These are some of the best power banks
 chota or powerful -asus Zenpower main 10,050 mah kii bydaree lagi he or yah credit card ke sies kaa he
 It charges the battery faster than the common powerbank and has 11 kinds of safety features
 isaki keemat lagbhag 1,400 rupee he
 Strong powerbank - Xiaomi has recently launched a 20,000mah power bank, which allows you to charge your smartphone 4 to 5 times
 isaki keemat 2,199 rupee he
 Fast Charging Powerbank -aukery Quick Charge 2
 0 power bank ke jariye aap smartphone ko teji se charge kar sakate hai
 It has a Qualcomm Quick Charge feature and its battery power is 10,400mah
 isaki keemat lagbhag 4,500 rupee he
 However, Xiaomi has also brought a 10,000 Mi Pro fast charging power bank, which costs Rs 2,000
 lekin abhi uplabdh nahin he
 Cheap and Good Power Bank -ambrane's 13,000mah Powerbank is quite popular in India and is best selling on e-commerce
 isaki keemat lagbhag 900 rupee he
 Keeping in mind the Lok Sabha elections next year, the All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) has formed an electoral alliance with the Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh (BBM), which has a strong influence in the scheduled castes of Maharashtra
 gathbandhan kii ghoshnaa ke liye aurangabad main 2 aktubar ko yojit ek sanyukt raily main eiemiem ke pramukh asaduddin ovaisi ne ghoshnaa kii ki bhim raav ambedkar vastav main mahatma gandhi se bade netaa the
 He said that this Dalit great man gave the country the largest democratic weapon - the Constitution
 is nae gathbandhan kii najar rajya ke 13 fisadi dalit or 12 fisadi muslim votaron par he jo aapas main milakar rajya kii 48 main se chaar loksabhaa siton aurangabad, akola, maalegaanv or mumbai-dakshin madhya main chunavi nateezon ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 BBM President Prakash Ambedkar says that this alliance will change the old trends of voting
 ve kehete hai, ''ham bhaajapa ko sabak sikhaane ke liye ekajute ho gaye hai
 "but it has spoiled the Congress plan to form a common front against the BJP
" eiemiem ko saajheedaar banane se kataraane vaali congress ke pradesh adhyaksh ashok chavaan ko puri ummid thi ki ve bibiem ko apane saath le aaenge
 But Ambedkar is adamant on an alliance with AIMIM and says that he will consider the Congress proposal only if it is ready to give the state 12 seats to BBM
 ambedkar sharad pavaar ko avasarwaadi bataakar unki nesanalist congress party ke (encipe) saath gathbandhan ko khaarij kar chuke hai
 Analysts say that the BBM-AIMIM alliance will not succeed outside Akola
 ambedkar akola se hi chunaav laduya chaahate hai
 He says that AIMIM has lost its advantage after winning assembly elections in central Aurangabad and Byculla in 2014 and achieving huge success in Nanded's municipal corporation
 chah maheenaa pehle usee nanded nagar nigam chunaav main party ko ek bhi seat nahin mili thi
 Voters are angry with the way Owaisi recently insisted MLA Waris Pathan to apologize for raising the slogan of Ganapati during the Ganesh festival
 nishchit rup se is gathbandhan ke liye yah aasaan chunaav nahin hone vaala he
 Minister of State for Social Justice Ramdas Athawale, who has a significant influence among Dalits, says that the BBM-AIMIM alliance is actually going to be a boon for the BJP as it will lead to division of votes
 iske alaava, maharashtra muslim sangh (ms) jo 2 karod sadasyon vaale kareeb 50 enjio kaa ek samuhik sanghathan he, eiemiem ko 'bahari' maanata he
 Its chairman Fakir Mohammad Thakur says, "we need local leaders
 ''udhar, bhaajapa kaa khemaa bibiem-eiemiem ke gathbandhan ko apni party keobisi janaadhar ko majboot karne kaa ek behtareen avasar maanata he
 The ruling party is already planning to emphasize various programs of the state government for the obcs
 yahaan tak ki shivasena ko bhi lagata he ki isse bhaajapa ko phayda hoga
 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut says, "the BJP itself has formed this alliance so that it can dent the opposition votes
" ''eiemiem kaa prabhaav 2014 ke baad gata haih nanded kii mahanagarapalika main chah maheene pehle ke chunaav main party ko koi seat hasil nahin hui
 *** ekataraf to centre sarkaar ne naaballig bacchiyon se rape ke doshi ke liye faansee kii sajaa kaa nayaa kanoon bana diya he, vahiin odisha main ek aisa maamla saamne aayaa he, jisamen panchayat naaballig divyang ladki se rape ke maamle ko rafa-dfa karne main lagi thi
 Finally, when the victim became pregnant, the family lodged a case with the police

 Police said that the accused is from Gadadhar Prasad village and has confessed his crime

 Arobi Brajbandhu Sahu took advantage of the victim being a Divya and raped her

 After the case of rape of a girl with a handicap, the people of the village wanted to refrain through the panchayat
 lekin 4 maheene biit jane ke baad bhi panchayat ne aaropee vyakti ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kii
 Meanwhile, the victim girl also became pregnant, then the family took shelter of the police
 bataate chalem ki chhattisgarh ke dhamtari jile se ek pujari dwaara ek divyang yuvati ke saath rape kaa sansanikhej maamla saamne aayaa tha
 Ramashankar Vaishnav (28), residing in the Ram temple complex located in the Kotwali police station area of dhamtari town, has been accused of rape by a Divyang girl (24)
 24 taarikh kii shaam peedita computer class se waapas ghar ja rahi thi
 At the same time, Vaishnav told her that her mother was in the temple

 The government said on Tuesday that the Land Acquisition and Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill has been drafted and opinions have been sought from various parties on it
 gramin vikaas rajya mantri shishir kumaar adhikari ne captain singh solanki ke sawaalon ke likhit jawaab main mangalvaar ko rajyasabha ko yah jaankaree di
 He informed that several provisions have been included in the draft bill to reduce the adverse effects of land acquisition on farmers
 lekhak:haakaan gundeprakashak:yatra books, bhartiya anuwaad parishadmulya:295 rupecovar:paperbakajis akhbaar, jis magazine ko uthaaie usamen kuch chuninda prakashkon kii kitabon ke bare main hi charchaa hoti he
 One, the space of literature is shrinking in the media, and in that shrinking space, the discussion is being reduced to some 'special' books
 nateeja yah hota he ki hamen bahut sari acchhee yaa jaruri kitabon ke prakaashan kaa pataa hi nahin chalata
 Some are known through Facebook etc
 Many are not there either
 misaal ke liye, turki kii nayab kitabon ke bare main mujhe bhi pataa nahin chalaa hota agar chaar kitabon kaa nayab tohfa mujhe yatra books se na mila hota
 These four books are from Turkish authors, authors who are popular, popular authors there
 main in kitabon ke upar baari-baari se likhane kii koshish karunga
 The first novel that i am going to discuss today is 'dafn Hoti Zindagi', the award-winning novel in 2011 as the best Turkish novel, written by Hakan Gunde
 angreji ke madhyam se use sahaj, saral bhashaa main ham tak pahunchane kaa kaam kiya he spanish bhashaa kii vidhushi, markege ke upanyaas ‚Äòvan handred iers of sulitud‚Äô ke upar shodh karne vaali, shodh ke antargat uskaa anuwaad karne vaali manisha taneja ne
 Two types of novels are written and read extensively in Turkey
 ek to vahaan aparaadh kathaayen khub likhi jaati hai or padhi bhi jaati hai, vaise upanyaas jinako angreji main thriller kehete hai
 Secondly, novels whose role as a model i see Orhan Pamuk's novel 'snow'
 yani ek ‚Äòudaar‚Äô samaaj main kattartavaadi islamic sanghathanon ke sangharsh kii khunrej kahani
 The readers of 'west' like this plot very much, which presents a barbaric image of Islam to them
 ‚Äòsabhyataaon ke sangharsh‚Äô ke daur main islam ko kattar bataakar, barbar bataakar, madhyugin soch kaa bataakar pashchimi samaaj apni shreshthata ko pesh kar paata he
 Novels written on the basis of such a story get a large readership, increase the chances of getting reward
 haakaan gunde kaa yah upanyaas isi duusare varg kaa upanyaas he
 There is a darda who is married at the age of 11 to the son of a sheikh
 upanyaas main ek prasang aata he ki gaanv main shaikh kii gadiyon kaa kafila jab ladki pasand karne ke liye gaanv main aata he, to gaanv kaa maahaul jis tarah kaa dikhaaya gaya he usase mujhe barabas sagar sarahadi kii film ‚Äòbazaar‚Äô kii yaad aa gai, jisamen khadi desh kaa ek paise vaala adhed hyderabad aata he ladki pasand karne taaki usase shaadi rachaai ja sake
 There is competition that he buys my girl, he buys my girl
 baharhaal, derda ko byaah kar landan le jaaya jaataa he, vahaan ek apartment main vah kaidi kii tarah paanch saal tak rahati he, jahaan apane mard kii havas shant karne ek alaava uske paas koi kaam nahin hota he
 One day she escapes from there
 vah heroin kii aadi ho jaati he
 a woman named Anne gives her second life
 vah peshey se nurse hoti he, lekin derda ko vah apni beti kii tarah rakhti he
 His life changes
 aisi kai jindagiyaan hai
 Turkey has a love for it
 uske samaaj kii pechidgiyaan hai
 There are ups and downs of life
 dharm kii banati-tuutati deevaaron ke bich insaaniyat kaa ujaalaa he jo sabko jode rakhata he
 There is no doubt that the USP of this novel, written by centering the atrocities in the name of Islam, is that Islam increases bigotry, creates distances, buries human lives in the name of religion
 lekin isamen koi shaq nahin ki haakaan gunde ne aparaadh kathaon kii gutthiyon main, pechidagiyon main, insaani rishton ke jajbaat kaa aisa rasayan milaayaa he ki aap upanyaas kii rahasmayi duniya main dhansate chale jate hai
 Thank you Travel Books

 Nifad MLA Bunker said he was confident in the leadership of party chief Sharad Pawar
 bunker ne kaha ki unhen bhi ajit pavaar kii ore se rajbhavan pahunchane ke liye kaha gaya tha or vahaan kya hone vaala he isaki koi jaankaree unhen nahin thi
 Earlier in the afternoon while addressing a press conference with Sharad Pawar, Shingne said, "when i reached the Raj Bhavan, i saw that eight to ten mlas were already there
" ham main se kisi ko yah pataa nahin tha ki hamen vahaan kyon bulaayaa gaya he
 We went to meet Pawar saheb after the swearing-in ceremony
 '' unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòyah sab isliye hua kyonki kuch galatfahami thi, chunki ajit pavaar ne hamen bulaayaa tha
 Sharad Pawar had earlier said that Ajit Pawar is the leader of the NCP Legislature Party and that is why he had the signatures, names and assembly constituency wise list of all 54 mlas for the party's internal work
 unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòmujhe lagata he ki usne vahi suchi rajyapal ko samarthan patr ke taur par saunpi he
 If this is correct, the governor is misled

 shivasena ke saath gathbandhan ko lekar congress kii hai tamaam shartengathbandhan sarkaar main congress chaahati he barabari kii hissedarimangalvaar kaa din maharashtra main bahut hi gahamagahami bharaa rahaa
 When the screws over the formation of government in Maharashtra were not resolved, then President Ram Nath Kovind imposed President's rule in the state
 maharashtramen agle 6 maheene ke liye raashtrapati shashan lagu ho chukaa he
 But meanwhile, Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress have not given up
 aaj congress netaaon kaa ek dal ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar se sarkaar gathan ko lekar baatcheet karne pahunchaa tha
 After a round of discussion, the NCP and the Congress made their stand clear at a joint press conference and said that we will talk to each other first and only then we will talk to the Shiv Sena
 barabari kaa haq chaahati he congrescongress sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik congress ne maharashtra main sarkaar main shaamil hone par apni kuch sharten rakhi hai
 The Congress wants that if it joins the government, it should get respectable and almost equal share and the cabinet should be equally divided among the three parties
 yahi vajah he ki sonia gandhi ke mukhya sankatmochak ahamed patel mumbai pahunche the
 He has been given the responsibility that if the alliance talks with the Shiv Sena are final then the Congress position will be better
 cabinet main samaan hissedari kaa formulacongress sutron ke mutabik congress chaahati he ki sarkaar main teenon dalon kii baraabar hissedari ke saath har ek dal kii ek tihaai numaaindgi ho
 This means that 42 cabinet ministers should be placed in the government and they should be divided into three parts
 yaniensipi, shivasena or congress har party ke khate 14-14 cabinet mantri sarkaar main shaamil hon
 Along with this, there is also pressure from the Congress that important portfolios like Home and Revenue of the Cabinet should be honestly distributed among the three parties
 bhale hi congress ke paas sabase kam vidhayak hon lekin gathbandhan kii sarkaar main vah us hisaab se apni hissedari nahin chaahati he
 Two Deputy Chief Ministers will also be in the condition that there is a possibility in the alliance government that the post of Chief Minister will be with the Shiv Sena, in such a situation, the Congress wants to appoint two Deputy Chief Ministers in the state, one of which is from his party
 baatcheet ke daur se aisa saaf mahasoos ho rahaa he ki donon hi paksh ne apane ateet ko dekhte hue bahut saavdhaanee se aage bad rahe hai
 When BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha reached rjd's Iftar party, the face of the entire Lalu family blossomed
 bihar ke purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne apane sarkari awaas par iftaar party rakhi thi jisamen mahagathbandhan ke sabhi netaaon sahit mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko bhi aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 Nitish Kumar did not attend the iftar party, but BJP MP and cine star Bihari Babu reached the iftar party
 shatrughna sinha ne ajtak se baatcheet main kaha, 'mujhe lalu parivaar kii taraf se iftaar party main aane kaa nyotaa mila tha isliye chalaa gaya
 'though today, iftar party of BJP JDU was also there, but Shatrughan Sinha said that he got the invitation from RJD only
 tejpratap- tejasvi main lagi rahi shatrughna ke paas baithne kii hodashatrughna ke iftaar party main pahunchate hi sara atension unke upar hi aa gaya
 Tejashwi Yadav and his elder brother Tej Pratap Yadav stayed around Shatrughan
 is dauraan donon bhaiyon main shatrughna sinha ke kareeb baithne kii hode bhi dikhi, halaki tejpratap hi shatrughna sinha ke bagal main baithe dikhaai die or tejasvi ko baithne ke liye alag se kursi lagaani padi
 During this time, Lalu Yadav's daughter and RJD Rajya Sabha MP Misa Bharti also appeared
 kya aglaa chunaav RJD se ladenge shatrughna?shatrughna sinha ne kaha ki unke yahaan aane ko raajnneeti se jod kar nahin dekha janaa chahie
 It has nothing to do with politics, this is an opportunity for mutual brotherhood and i have come to maintain a relationship because i have a long standing relationship with the Lalu family
 is maukey par jab patrakaron ne shatrughna sinha se poocha ki kya wo argedy se chunaav ladenge to bagal main baithe tejpratap ne kaha kyon nahin? is par shatrughan sinha ne bhi kaha, 'tejpratap ke munh main ghi shakkar'
 May be true Tej Pratap's talk Shashtrughan Sinha is a BJP MP from Patna for the last two terms
 pichley saal wo patna sahib seat se chune gaye the lekin bijepi ne unhen nazarandaaj kiya or dheer- dheer talkhi badhati gai
 Shatrughan continued to target his party and government, but the party did not take any action against him
 ye mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi alaakaman pehle se hi is baar unhen tikat na dene kaa man bana chuki he, isliye shatrughna sinha nae ghar kii talash main hai
 Because Shatrughan has been seen standing with the Lalu family on several occasions, it is likely that he will contest the next election from the RJD
 kharaab sehat ke chalate party main shaamil nahin hue laluargedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav iftaar party main shaamil nahin hue
 His daughter Misa Bharti told that he is not well, so he did not attend the Iftar party
 unhone kaha ki lalu ko health ground par bel mili he or unki tabiyat thik nahin he
 He has to have surgery which will be decided within a week, his sugar level was also high and the sooner this level goes down, the sooner his surgery will be done
 misa ne ajtak se baatcheet main kaha ki lalu yadav ne jab se mukhyamantri kaa pad sambhala he tab se wo iftaar party dete aae he lekin pichley kuch varshon main kuch dal or sanghathan bhi aisa karne lage hai, jaise ki aresas or bijepi, ye sab kabhi iftaar party nahin rakhte the
 But leaving it social work made it a political event
 hamaari taraf se ye ek jutata kaa pratik he jise rashtriya janata dal detii rahi he or aage bhi detii rahegi
 Iftar of Janata Dal (U), Congress MLA, iftar party of RJD and JDU was organized in one day
 donon partiyon ne apane- apane sahyogi dalon ko aamantrit kar apni takat kaa izhaar lekin khaas baat ye rahi ki argedy kii iftaar party main bijepi ke saansad shatrughna sinha pahunche to jediu kii iftaar party main congressi vidhayak munna tiwari pahunche
 When asked about joining jdu's Iftar party, he said that he and all the mlas of my party had received the invitation letter
 meraa man hua or main aa gaya
 Earlier i attended Lalu ji's Iftar party and have just come to Haj Bhavan
 meraa party badalane kaa koi man nahin he main congress kaa vidhayak hum or congress main hi rahoonga

 Harjit Christ of Gurdaspur, one of the 40 Indians kidnapped from the city of Mosul after the war in Iraq last year, has medicated that the rest of his companions have been killed by ISIS militants
 lekin videsh mantralay ne harjit ke is daawey ko kaarij kar diya he
 Harjeet Christ survived the terrorists' bullet and returned to his homeland with the help of the Indian High Commission in Iraq
 sangrur se aam aadmi party ke saansad bhagwant maan ke mohali sthit awaas par harjit messiah apane rishtedaaron ke saath panhucha or media ke saath apana raaj saajha kiya
 Showing the wounds of the bullet on his thigh, Harjit Christ says that if any of his companions survived, he would be most happy
 lekin 15 june kaa din vah kabhi nahin bhuulegaa
 Death had touched him very closely
 harjit or uske saathiyon ko vatan waapas bhejne ke naam par iesas ke aatankiyon ne construction company se 50 bangladeshiyon ke saath 11 june ko agava kiya
 He was then handed over to another group of ISIS militants
 phir do din baad ek nayaa group sabko apane saath kisi or thikaane par le gaya
 Here the Bangladeshis were separated from the Indians and then the next day all the Indians were put in an armored car and taken to a hill
 aatankiyon ne yahaan sabake phone or cash le liye or ulti taraf munh karke khadey hone ko kaha or firing shuru kar di
 Harjeet saw his comrades falling on both sides
 firing kareeb 2 se 3 minute chali
 a bullet came out touching Harjeet's thigh, he also fell down
 saath main khadaa bhartiya uske upar gir gaya
 About 15 minutes after the terrorists left, Harjeet woke up and called his comrades
 lekin kisi ne jawaab nahin diya
 Harjit reached the highway and asked for help from a carriage but unfortunately he took Harjeet to the same terrorists
 harjit ne yahaan bataaya ki uskaa naam ali he or vah bangladeshi he
 Then he saved his life
 aatankiyon ne uskaa pataa poocha or agle din waapas mosul uski company main panhucha diya jahaan usne ek jaankaar canteen vaale ko puraa vakya bataaya
 He left the person Harjeet to the border of Erbil where he reached and contacted the Indian High Commission
 ek haftaa iraq main rakhane ke baad harjit ko sarkaar bharat le aayi
 But for the last 10 months he was kept away from the family
 tippaniyan Harjeet was told that his life was in danger
 use naukari kaa vaayada kiya gaya lekin kabhi noida, kabhi bangalore or phir dharmashala ke chakkar kaatane ke baad akhirkaar harjit apane ghar aa gaya
 He wants to live a normal life and does not want government agencies to harass him and his family
 lekin videsh mantralay ko harjit ki baat par yakeen nahin
 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said that Harjeet was under the patronage of the ministry but is no longer in touch with him
 videsh mantri ne kaha ki sarkaar ke paas maujuud jaankaree ke mutabik sabhi 39 bhartiya surakshit hai or uski talash jari rahegi
 But the Ministry of External Affairs has rejected Harjit's claim
 harjit messiah aatankiyon kii goli se batch gaya tha or iraq sthit bhartiya ucchayog kii madad se vatan laut aayaa he
 At the Mohali residence of Aam Aadmi Party MP Bhagwant Mann from Sangrur, Harjit Christ reached out to his relatives and shared his secret with the media
 apni jaangh par goli ke zakhm dikhaate hue harjit messiah kahata he ki agar uskaa koi saathi zindaa batch gaya ho to sabase zyaada kushi use hogi
 But he will never forget the day of June 15
 maut use behad kareeb se chhukar nikal gayi thi
 ISIS militants abducted 50 Bangladeshis from the construction company on June 11 in the name of sending Harjeet and his associates back to their homeland
 iske baad unhen iesas aatankiyon ke duusare group ko saunp diya gaya
 Then two days later a new group took everyone with them to another hideout
 yahaan bangladeshiyon ko bharatiyon se alag kar diya gaya or phir agle din sabhi bharatiyon ko ek bakhtarband gaadi main daalkar kisi pahari par le jaaya gaya
 The terrorists took everyone's phone and cash here and asked to stand upside down and started firing
 harjit ne apane donon taraf saathiyon ko girte dekha
 The firing lasted for about 2 to 3 minutes
 ek goli harjit ki jaangh chhukar nikal gayi, vah bhi neeche gira
 The Indian standing together fell on him
 aatankiyon ke jane ke kareeb 15 minute baad harjit uthaa or apane saathiyon ko awaz lagaai
 But no one answered
 harjit haive par panhucha or ek gaadi vaale se madad maangi lekin badakismati se vah harjit ko unhi aatankiyon ke paas le gaya
 Harjeet told here that his name is Ali and he is Bangladeshi
 tab jaakar uski jaan bachi
 The terrorists asked for his address and the next day Mosul arrived in his company where he told the whole story to a knowledgeable canteen
 vah shaks harjit ko erbil ke border tak chhod gaya jahaan pahunchakar usne bhartiya ucchayog se sampark saadhaa
 After a week in Iraq, Harjit was brought to India by the government
 lekin pichley 10 maheene se use parivaar se alag rakhaa gaya
 The comments harjit ko bataaya gaya ki uski jaan ko khatra he
 He was promised a job but sometimes after traveling to Noida, sometimes Bangalore and then Dharamshala, Harjeet finally came home
 vah aam zindagi jeena chahta he or chahta he ki sarkaar ki agenciyaan use or uske parivaar ko tang na karen
 But the Ministry of External Affairs is not convinced about Harjeet
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki harjit mantralay ke sangrakshan main tha lekin ab vah unke sampark main nahin he
 The Foreign Minister said that according to the information available with the government, all 39 Indians are safe and their search will continue
 sangrur se aam aadmi party ke saansad bhagwant maan ke mohali sthit awaas par harjit messiah apane rishtedaaron ke saath panhucha or media ke saath apana raaj saajha kiya

 "punjab Pradesh Congress President Pratap Singh Bajwa said in a press conference on 3 February that" thousands of industrial units have been shut down in the state since the Shiromani Akali Dal and BJP coalition government came to power in April 2007
 ‚Äô‚Äô jaahir-si baat he ki unke is bayaan se rajya sarkaar ke tevar to chadhgaye hi the
 Madan Mohan Mittal, old BJP leader in Punjab and Minister of Industry in the state government, says that the information given in response to the RTI of the Congress is actually about the factories that were closed in the first seven years of 2007, in which Amarinder Singh headed for five years Wali was the Congress government
 punjab ke udyog sachiv vikaas pratap singh kehete hai ki band udyogon ke bare main zyaadaatar jaankariyaan 2007-08 main kendriya kutir, laghu or majhole udyog mantralay kii akhil bhartiya gananaa se lee gai hai
 There may be partial truth in these things, but at the same time the truth is that the state administration is completely unaware about the closed industrial units in the last seven years
 yah baat artiai ke jawaab se bhi jaahir ho rahi he
 For instance, according to Sood and Jindal, there is no reference to the government's response to the countless industrial units of steel that have been shut down in the last three years
 (mandi, gobindgarh main ek steel rolling mil main mashiinon ke kal-purje alag karte majdoor)mushkil dauraudyogon kii yah durdasha sattarudh akali dal-bijepi or congress kii aapasi siyaasi khinchataan kaa bahaanaa ban sakati he
 Already, BJP supporters say Jindal, "we are neither the Congress nor the BJP or the Akali Dal
" hamaara dharm to vikaas ke liye kaam karnaa he
 "why then?" Why is the state of industries in this state famous for its entrepreneurship? Rajiv Sood says that this crisis has arisen today due to the policies of both the Center and the Government of Punjab

 Now Shahabuddin's supporters have decided not to celebrate Muharram in protest against Shahabuddin going to jail
 baithak main muharram nahin manaane kaa faislashhabuddin ke samarthakon ne mohiuddinpur gaanv main baithak kii or sarvasammati se muharram main akhaada nahin uthaane kaa sankalp liya
 During this time people said that minorities are feeling insecure in the present government
 isse pehle bhi argedy ke purv saansad shahabuddin ke samarthakon ne shahabuddin ke jail jane par siwan kii sadakon par sarkaar ke khilaaf pradarshan bhi kiya or naare lagaae the
 The Patna High Court had given an explanation as to how angry the Shahabuddin is going to jail, it can be gauged from the fact that those people proposed to take Laloo Prasad Yadav out of the party itself
 gauratlab he ki argedy ke purv saansad shahabuddin ko 7 sitambar ko patna hai court se jamaanat mili thi or 11 saal baad jail se baahar aane kaa mauka mila tha
 The supporters of Shahabuddin who came out on the streets saw a lot of happiness in their supporters, but Shahabuddin had to go to jail again after only 20 days, which caused a huge shock to the supporters
 shahabuddin ne jail se nikalne par or jail jate vakt bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par hamalaa bolaa tha
 As soon as Shahabuddin went to jail, the supporters took to the streets and staged a demonstration against the government in Siwan
 bihar sarkaar kii hui thi kirakirishhabuddin kegel sanicalne par sarkaar kii kaaphi kirakiri hui thi or sarkaar par yah aarope laga tha ki sarkaar kii laaparvaahee ke kaaran hi shahabuddin ko jamaanat mili
 The Bihar government then challenged the bail decision of Shahabuddin from the Patna High Court to the Supreme Court, after hearing on which the Supreme Court canceled Shahabuddin's bail and Shahabuddin was again sent to jail

 sarkaar kii aalochanaon par jadyu ne jab apni ankhe tareri, to argedy pramukh lalu prasad puure maamle ko thik karne ke liye maidan main utar gaye hai
 JDU is upset with the constant attack by RJD leaders involved in rjd's attack
 jediu pravaktaa sanjay singh ne is par palatwaar karte hue kaha ki ye mahagathbandhan ke liye thik nahin he
 Some RJD leaders have been continuously trying to discredit the face of the government
 jediu ise ab sahan nahin karegaa
 Sanjay Singh asked the RJD in question, whether my leader has ever condemned RJD chief Lalu Prasad, then why should his party tolerate the RJD attack
 jediu pravaktaa niraj kumaar ne kaha ki sarkaar main rah kar sarkaar kii aalochana ham katai sahan nahin karenge
 Raised on the cm's seven determination, let me say that some RJD mlas questioned CM Nitish Kumar's ambitious plan, seven decisions and MLA funds
 jediu netaa isse hi naaraaz hai
 They say that even before this, senior party leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh has been continuously attacking the government
 bich-bachaav ko aae lalu prasadudhar, argedy pramukh lalu prasad ne puure maamle ko gambhirtha se lete hue kaha ki party main agar kisi ko koi dikkat he, to wo mujhase baat karen
 He has also advised his leaders not to make statements in the media

 By the time Sachin Tendulkar started his career in first-class cricket, Sunil Gavaskar had said goodbye to cricket
 sunil gavaskar ke saath khilne sachin tendulkar kaa jo sapana tha, vah puraa nahin ho paaya
 When Sachin was just 14 years old, Sunil Gavaskar gifted him his ultra light pad and advised him to play better
 sachin ne jab apane pehle ranjai match main shandaar shatak thoka tha, tab gavaskar ne bhavishyavaanee kii thi ki yah yah ladkaa (sachin tendulkar) ek din unke sabhi record ko tod degaa
 The comments gavaskar kii bhavishyavaanee phir 10 disambar ko hi sach hui : sachin acha khelte rahe or bhartiya team main unka chayan hua
 On 15 November 1989, Sachin started his Test career against Pakistan
 karachi main khele gaye is test match main sachin sirf 15 ran bana paae the
 On 9 August 1990, he scored the first century of his Test career against England
 sachin ek ballebaaj ke rup main aage badhate gaye or shatak jamaate rahe
 Sachin Tendulkar broke Gavaskar's (10122) record of scoring the most runs in Test cricket
 10 disambar, 2005 ko sachin tendulkar ne test maichon main gavaskar ke sarvaadhik 34 shatak ke record ko todaa
 Thus, after 17 years, Gavaskar's prediction came true
 yahaan dilachasp baat yah he ki sachin ne 10 disambar ko hi pratham shrenee maichon main apana pehla shatak jamaaya tha or 10 disambar ko hi unhone test maichon main sarvaadhik shatak banane kaa gavaskar kaa record todaa
 Gavaskar's prediction again came true on December 10: Sachin kept playing well and was selected in the Indian team
 15 november, 1989 ko pakistan ke khilaaf sachin ne apana test kariyar shuru kiya
 Sachin was able to score just 15 runs in this Test match played in Karachi
 9 agast, 1990 ko unhone england ke khilaaf apane test kariyar kaa pehla shatak jadaa
 Sachin went ahead as a batsman and scored a century
 test cricket main sabase zyada ran banane ke gavaskar (10122) ke record ko sachin tendulkar ne todaa
 On 10 December 2005, Sachin Tendulkar broke Gavaskar's record of the most 34 centuries in Tests
 is tarah 17 saalon ke baad gavaskar kii bhavishyavaanee sach sabit hui
 The interesting thing here is that Sachin scored his first century in first-class matches on December 10 and on December 10, he broke Gavaskar's record of making the most centuries in Tests
 is tarah 17 saalon ke baad gavaskar kii bhavishyavaanee sach sabit hui

 unhone kaha ki yah maarg puraane maarg kii tulana main zyada aaramdaayak or surakshit hoga
 Lee said, instead of the great risks of traveling through inaccessible valleys, you can go to the holy place by bus by looking at the beauty of the way
 unhone kaha, mujhe bharosa he ki bhartiya dost bhi garmjoshi bharaa aatithy or chini logon ke dostana ravaiye ko mahasoos karenge

 Having said that, coming back in a while, will leave them on Dronagiri mountain

 Satpal Maharaj had to return
 ish par unhone makhyamantri ko patr likhakar naaraazgi jaati
 However, Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat has described the incidents as very minor and said that all this happens

 Only then does he step forward

 On the other hand, if reliable sources are to be believed, the three mlas supporting the Trivend have held a meeting three times against new guests from the Congress at a secret place

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who used new jargon and was recognized as a great orator, today used the new terminology in the United Nations as 'g-all' and said that different groups will face different challenges

 modi ne sanyukt raashtra mahasabha ke 69wein satr ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'aaj, ham ab bhi kai 'ji' (samoohon) main vibhinn sankhya main kaam kar rahe hai
 India is also involved in many of these
 parantu ham ji-1 yaa ji-ol ke rup milakar kaam karne main kitna safal hue hai

 The Prime Minister said, 'on the one hand we say that our fates are related to each other, on the other hand we still think in terms of profit and loss'
 agar duusare ko laabh hota he, to mujhe nuksaan hota he
 ' aatankwaad tathaa duusari chunautiyon se nipatane ke liye saajha prayaason kaa aahvaan karte hue modi ne sawaal kiya ki kya ham adhik ekajute hue hai jabaki ham paraspar nirbhar vishwa kii baat karte hai
 He said, 'it is easy to be cynical and say that nothing can change, but if we do this, we run away from our responsibilities and we endanger our collective future

 Angered by the report, BJP demanded Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar to remove JPC President PC Chacko, while Congress members wrote to the Lok Sabha Speaker to remove three BJP leaders Yashwant Sinha, Jaswant Singh and Ravi Shankar Prasad

 India, on the other hand, said that 'honored' guests are free to go anywhere in the country
 'meri yatra raajnneetik nahin'dalai lamas ne bhi kaha tha ki unki yatra raajnneetik nahin he, isliye china kii aapatti uske ‚Äònakaaratmak‚Äô rukh ko pradarshit karti he

 These stains are visible from a CAG report
 kaig ne apni report main neshnal technical research orgenigeshan yani antiaro main hajaar karod rupye ke gholate kaa khulaasa kiya he
 Read: Spectrum Scam: Willing to be fired | Scam In the year 2010 thousand crore, 450 crore deal is unmanned aircraft alone
 maanav rahit vimaan kharidne kii ye deal neshnal technical research orgenigeshan ne kii thi
 According to the rule, NTRO has to take permission from the CCS i
e
 Cabinet Committee on Security for a deal of more than 20 crores
 sisies ne is deal ke liye 300 karod rupye kii manjuuri di thi, lekin antiaro ne ise kharida 450 karod rupye main
 That is, without the approval of CCS, the budget of the deal was increased by 150 crores
 sidhaa 150 karod rupye kii lut
 In this deal only 150 crores scam has not happened
 is kharid main desh kii suraksha ko bhi taak par rakhaa gaya
 Unmanned aircraft purchased from Israel were not even tested by connecting them to Indian satellites
 kharidne ke baad khulaasa hua ki kharide gaye yuavi bhartiya ilaake main kargar nahin hai
 That is, in this deal, the entire Rs 450 crore was received
 iske alaava bhi antiaro kii bhartee prakiya or vittiya kaamkaaj main bhi sheersh adhikariyon kii taraf se gadabadi kii kai baaten saamanen ai hai
 Perhaps these things would never have come to light because no one has the right to audit the funds received by NTRO, but when there were reports of disturbances in this organization, the audit instructions were given for the first time after the intervention of the Prime Minister
 isi audit se antiaro ke sheersh adhikariyon kaa ghotaalaa saamne aayaa
 These reports have now become the throat of the government
 bajet satr se pehle hi ye report sarkaar ke paas pahunch gai thi, lekin abtak sarkaar ne ise sansad main pesh nahin kiya
 It is clear how serious the government is on this report
 hairaani kii baat he ki jis saude main desh kii suraksha daanv par laga di gai ho, usamen jimmedaar logon ke khilaaf abtak koi karrwai nahin hui he

 Rating to date - 9 / 10 dilli main jeet ke baad ab bijepi ke parshadon ko nayaa target mila he
 This is the target to clean up Delhi
 kendriya mantri vijay goyal ne kaha he kimodi mantraka matlab he ki vikaas kaa mantra or safai kaa mantra
 According to Goyal, while councilors have not formally handled their work
 parshad pad kii shapath nahin lee he, tab unhen party ke adhyaksh ne kartavya bodh karaayaa he, kyonki parshadon ko shahar kii samasyaon ke prati samvedansheel bananaa he
 To realize the great responsibility on his shoulders
 goyal ke mutabik amit shah ne piem modi ke vijan ko parshadon ke saamne rakhaa he or unhen naseehat di he ki vikaas parshadon kaa nahin, balki janata kaa hona chahie
 The public has high expectations from the BJP, and meeting those expectations is the real criterion of the councilors
 nae parshad bhi shah kii class ke baad sachet dikhe or bayanon main modi mantra kaa zikr karnaa nahin bhuule
 Nandni Sharma, who was elected as a councilor from Malviya Nagar, said that after becoming PM, Modi ji has shown the path of egovernance and Digital India in the country
 isiilie hamemasidimen bhi nagariko kii suvidhaon ke liye digital takneekee kaa istemaal karenge
 Councilor Anil Sharma from Hauz Khas said that Modi ji's dream is clean India and this is the first responsibility of MCD
 svachh bharat kaa sapana kaise saakaar hoga, is par sabase pehle kaam karnaa he, dilli ko na sirf svachh bananaa he, balki ise sundar bhi bananaa he
 Councilors were also given the mantra that the victory of the MCD is just a halt, not a destination
 isiilie aage aane vaale vidhansabha chunaav kii asli pariksha ke liye taiyaar rahen or isi ko lakshya maanakar kaam karen, janata ko bataaen kii dilli kaa vikaas or bhalaai vahi kar sakate hai
 Arvind Kejriwal went on to form a political party raising the voice of the common man against corruption and he also formed a party of the same name
 unhen laga ki janata ke aakrosh ko bhunaakar vah satta main aa sakate hai
 This is a natural thought and there is nothing wrong with it
 raajnneeti or vah bhi bhartiya raajnneeti ek keechad bhare talab kii tarah he jisamen jo utarataa he vah san jaataa he
 But perhaps Kejriwal was thinking that things would be different for him
 dusron par hamalaa karne vaale aksar apane bare main bhul jate hai
 Something similar happened in Kejriwal's case
 ab ek ke baad ek aarope kejariwal par lagate ja rahe hai
 The biggest allegation was that he took a religious leader accused of instigating riots and now the second big charge is that the people who give the money coming from abroad for him are not right and how much money has been received should be hidden
 Has been kejariwal in aaropon se khafa hai or apane aakraamak andaaj main inkaa pratirodh kar rahe hai jo unhen karnaa bhi chahie
 But now they must be finding that it is very easy to accuse others but when it comes to themselves, they get very hurt
 kejariwal ko ye baaten isliye bhi chubh rahi hongi, kyonki ve apane ko doodh kaa dhulaa samajhate hai or isamen koi buraai bhi nahin he
 His record is very clean but this politics does not leave anyone
 iske apane rang hai, apane andaaj hai or apane khel hai
 Just washing of milk does nothing in politics
 agar aisa hi hona hota to shiv kheda or manmohan singh kyon chunaav haar jate? ye log saaf-suthri chhavi ke to rahe hai hi, inke chaahane waalon kii taadaad bahut badi he
 Actually, when you attack another, be prepared to hurt yourself too, because it is like lifting a finger on another, in which four fingers also rise on your side and Kejriwal forgot this
 raajnneeti jhooth kii ek bhulbhulaiya he jisamen sach ko dhundhana kaaphi kathin hota he
 Now Kejriwal will have to tell this truth and all the allegations against him will have to be dismissed with evidence
 unka muqabla is khel ke bahut bade khilaadiyon se he jo unhen aasaani se baithne nahin denge
 But it is also an opportunity for them to establish themselves more firmly
 isse janata main unka vishwaas badhegaa or unke kadam majboot honge
 They have to put the habit of walking in the slippery path of politics

 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati termed the manifesto released by the Bharatiya Janata Party on Saturday in view of the upcoming elections to the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly, saying that those who made promises at the time of the Lok Sabha elections would be in the eye of the public
 This party has lost the moral right to issue the manifesto
 mayawati nebijapi adhyaksh amit shah dwaara jari kiye gaye chunavi ghoshnaptr par pratikriya dete hue kaha ki bhaajapa varsh 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav prachaar ke dauraan kiye gaye vaadon ko puraa karne main buree tarah naakaam rahi he
 In such a situation, this party has no moral right to issue its election manifesto
 unhone kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav ke vakt bhaajapa or unke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne apane ghoshnaptr menuttar pradeshsamet puure desh kii janata se tarah-tarah ke pralobhan die the or jo achche din dikhaane ke vaade kiye the, ve puure nahin kiye
 Mayawati said that the manifesto of BJP is going to throw dust in the eyes of the people of the state
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa ke sabhi chunavi vaade centre ke agenda se zyaadaatar gaayab ho gaye hai
 The BJP has not fulfilled even a quarter of its promises, despite the passing of nearly three years of its government at the Center
 unhone ashanka jataai ki bhaajapa uttar pradesh kii satta main aane par aarakshan ko khatm kar degi
 She said that she will start her campaign from February 1
 usamen jo vaade kiye jaaenge, unhen sarkaar banane par puraa karuungi
 At the same time, the socialist declared the manifesto of the BJP to be a bundle of lies
 sapa pravaktaa rajendra choudhary ne kaha ki bijepi kaa chunaav ghoshnaptr jhooth kaa pulinda he
 After the bitter experience of the Lok Sabha elections, now no one will believe his promises
 choudhary ne kaha ki chunaav kaa vakt aate hi bhaajapa ek baar phir ram mandir kaa mudda uthaate hue maahaul kharaab karne kii firaaq main he
 Apart from this, BJP is trying to deceive Muslims by making promises on issues like triple talaq, which are pending in court

 Despite pressure from pro-telangana groups, no decision on the central government's demand for a separate state is expected during the current budget session of Parliament
 sansad kaa bajet satr 10 may tak chalegaa
 An official of the government said that discussions are going on between the government and the Congress party, so there is no possibility of any decision in the budget session
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar vartmaan satr main mahatvapurn vittiya kaamkaaj nipataane kii koshish karegi or isamen koi vyavdhaan nahin chaahegi
 This officer said, 'we have to decide before the Lok Sabha elections due in 2014
 lekin ham is samvedansheel mudde par aise samay par faisla nahin kar sakate jab satr chal rahaa ho kyonki isse sansad main vyavdhaan ho saktaa he
 The government is also concerned that the decision on Telangana in haste will intensify the demand for separate states arising from other parts of the country
 haal hi main gorkha mukti morcha ne sarkaar se kaha tha ki agar vah pruthak telugana ke gathan par vichaar kar rahi he to use gorkhaland rajya kii unki maang par vichaar karnaa chahie
 However, advocating separate Telangana, NCP chief and Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar told the Prime Minister that it would not be right to delay the matter 
 pavaar ne kaha tha ki yah mudda unhone pradhanmantri ke samaksh uthaaya tha
 With this, the NCP became the first component of the UPA, which has openly demanded an early decision on Telangana
 pruthak telugana rajya par faisla 27 janvari ko centre or congress ne yah kah kar taal diya tha ki is par or vichaar vimarsh kii jarurat he or isamen samay lagegaa
 However, Telangana supporters have intensified their agitation

 After killing the Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Narendra Kumar in a tractor after trampling him in Morena, Panna is now reported to be firing sand mafia at SDM and SDOP
 ret mafia kii firing main donon adhikari bal‚àíbal batch gaye hai
 These officers went to take action against the mafia
 isse pehle, muraina main bhartiya police seva (ipies) ke adhikari narendra kumaar kii tractor se raundkar hatya, bhind main jayadevan par hamalaa or khargun main hamale main police jawan kii maut
 
 
 These incidents are seen as a testimony to the deteriorating law and order of Madhya Pradesh
 rajya main pichley kuch arase main apradhi tatwon ke hausale itane bad gaye hai ki unke liye police kaa asar bhi bouna ho chalaa he
 The situation is that they are not afraid to put their hands on even the police uniform
 muraina main ipies adhikari narendra kumaar ko kartavya nishtha kii keemat apni jaan dekar chukaana padi he
 Narendra had plagued the mining mafia while holding the post of subdivisional officer in Bamour
 unhone pichley do maah main kai aise vaahanon ko pakadaa tha, jo avaidh kaarobaar main lage the
 When the whole country was celebrating Holi, Narendra Kumar became a victim of mafias while performing his duty
 unki tractor se raundkar hatya kar di gai
 Similarly, in Bhind, IPS officer Jayadevan was attacked by the liquor mafia
 yah hamalaa kisi or ne nahin, balki bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke purv vidhayak narendra singh kushvaha or unke saathiyon ne kiya tha
 Similarly, the sand mafia in Mandaleshwar of Khargone attacked sub-inspector RB Goel and constable Raghunath Chauhan, killing Chauhan, while Goyal is struggling between life and death
 iske alaava beete dinon rajdhani bhopal ke kamalanagar thane main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) se jude logon ne police javaanon se marpet kii thi or baad main sarkaar ne dabaav main aakar pite 10 javaanon ko hi nilambit kar diya tha
 a few days later, when a video surfaced, the reality was revealed, the government had to reinstate all the soldiers on the backfoot
 sarkaar kii ore se jari aankade bataate hai ki beete 13 maah main sirf rajdhani main hi police bal par 25 hamale hue hai
 When this situation of the police force is there in the capital, it can be easily guessed what will happen in other parts

 Accusers and criminals will not be spared at any cost in the state
 sarkaar kisi ko sangrakshan nahin de rahi he, magar police bal ke saath jo ho rahaa he vah in bayanon se itar he
 Chauhan has even accused the opposition of bringing the state into disrepute
 tippaniyan It would be necessary to tell here that Mayawati's government has to go on the issue of corruption in Uttar Pradesh
 mayawati ne shuruyaat main bhrashtachar ke maamalon ko najar andaaj kiya or chunaav kareeb aane par bhrashtachar main lipt mantriyon par karrwai kii magar uskaa unhen laabh nahin mila
 The same situation has happened with regard to law and order in Madhya Pradesh

 rajya kaa mukhya vipakshi dal congress lagaataar shivaraj sarkaar par hamale bol rahaa he or use ek ke baad ek hamalaa karne kaa mauka sarkaar ke hi log de rahe hai
 The government was earlier surrounded by illegal mining, and now the deteriorating law and order situation is increasing the difficulties of the government

 These incidents are seen as a testimony to the deteriorating law and order of Madhya Pradesh
 rajya main pichley kuch arase main apradhi tatwon ke hausale itane bad gaye hai ki unke liye police kaa asar bhi bouna ho chalaa he
 The situation is that they are not afraid to put their hands on even the police uniform

 Narendra had plagued the mining mafia while holding the post of subdivisional officer in Bamour

 rajdhani main jab police bal kaa yah haal he to anya hisson main kya haal hoga is baat kaa sahajata se andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Whether Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan or Home Minister Umashankar Gupta have been constantly assuring that there is no bigger than law
 pradesh main kisi bhi keemat par aropiyon or aparaadhiyon ko bakhsha nahin jayega
 The government is not giving protection to anyone, but what is happening with the police force is beyond these statements

 The comments srilanka kii jeet kii sthiti main newjiland kaa patta saaf ho jayega kyonki maithyuj kii team chaar ankon ke saath agle daur main pahunch jaaegi lekin agar australia kaaphi bade antar se jeetne main safal rahaa to phir srilanka or newjiland donon kaa patta saaf ho jayega
 The Kiwi team would be wishing for Sri Lanka's defeat and Australia's victory but they would not want Australia to win by a big margin
 barish ne baadha daali or donon tiimon ko ek-ek ank mila to bhi newjiland kaa kaam aasaan ho jayega
 Sri Lanka, batting first after losing the toss, recovered from the initial setback and scored 253 for eight in the allotted 50 overs, thanks to a middle-order bowling

 yah match donon tiimon ke liye behad khaas he
 The England team from this group has reached the semi-finals but there is competition between the three teams for the remaining one spot
 tippaniyan In the event of Sri Lanka's win, New Zealand's leaf will be cleared as Mathews' team will advance to the next round with four points but if Australia manages to win by a huge margin then both Sri Lanka and New Zealand's leaf will be cleared
 kiwi team srilanka kii haar or australia kii jeet kii kaamana kar rahi hogi lekin vah katai nahin chaahegi ki australia ko bade antar se jeet mili
