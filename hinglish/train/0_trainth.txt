 The Modi government has taken many major decisions that have a major impact on the financial world during its tenure
 inamen notebandi kar desh main sanchaar ho rahe 86 fisadi mudra ko band karnaa or uski jagah nai mudra kaa sanchaar shuru karnaa, van nesan van tex kii pariklpana ke tahat guds and services tex (jiesti) lagu karnaa or bainkon kaa enpie sankat dur karne ke liye sarkari khajaane se lakhon karod kaa bhugtan karnaa shaamil hai
 In this sequence, the Modi government is enacting another law in the banking system, which will not only have a big impact on the banks, but every customer who holds money in a savings account in the bank will be under the purview of this law
 kya he nayaa kanoon?kendra sarkaar financial rejolution and diposit insurance bill (echardiai bill) 2017 ko jorshor se taiyaar kar aagaamee sheetakaaleen satr ke dauraan sansad main pesh karne ja rahi he
 Due to a strong majority in both the houses of Parliament, this bill will easily be passed and a new law will also be formed
 isse pehle is bill ko kendra sarkaar ne monsoon satr ke dauraan sansad main pesh kiya tha or tab ise joint parliamentry cameti ke paas suzav ke liye bhej diya gaya tha
 Now once again, the Central Government will present the proposal of the new bill in the Parliament in view of the suggestions of the Joint Parliamentary Committee
 kyon jaruri he nayaa kanoon?kendra sarkaar dwaara taiyaar kiye ja rahe is nae kanoon se donon sarkari or privet bank, insurance companiyaan or anya vittiya sansthaaon main diwaliyapan kii samasya se nipatane ke liye ek nayaa dhaancha taiyaar kiya jayega
 The central government claims that the law will be a landmark reform of the financial sector after the approval of foreign investment in banking and insolvency codes in the country, recapitalization plans of state-run banks and insurance sector
 is kanoon se kaise badal jayega aapkaa bank?kendra sarkaar ke nae echardiai kanoon se ek maujuuda kanoon diposit insurance and credit guarantee corporation khatm kar diya jayega
 Presently, this law is guaranteed for your money deposited in different banks
 is kanoon main ek ahm praavdhaan ki kisi bank ke biimaar hone kii sthiti main yadi use diwalia ghoshit kiya jaataa he to bank ke graahakon kaa ek lakh rupee tak diposit bank ko waapas karnaa hoga
 Hence the current banking system of the country is considered to be the most secure and reliable by this law
 is surakshit banking vyavastha ke chalate hi desh main bainkon ke graahakon ko bank main vishwaas kaayam rahata he ki unka paisa kabhi dub nahin saktaa
 The government guarantees customers deposits even after a bank is insolvent
 banegaa nayaa rejolution corporationalekin nae kanoon ke jariye praavdhaan kiya jayega jahaan yah dharna puri tarah se khatm ho jaaegi
 a new resolution corporation will be set up under the Ministry of Finance, removing the old law
 philhal kisi bank kii vittiya sthiti kaa aankalan karne or use vittiya sankat se baahar nikalne kii salaan dene kaa kaam rigerv bank karata tha
 But after passing the FRDI Act, the new resolution corporation will start doing this work
 nae kanoon kaa sabase khatarnaak praavdhaan: permanent notebandiphilhal desh main bank main vittiya sankat kii sthiti paidaa hone par bainko ko belout package diya jaataa he
 This bailout package is provided by the Central Government from its treasury and the bank which was ruined by distributing dirty debts in the corporate sector tries to stand again with the help of this bailout package
 echardiai kanoon ke tahat praavdhaan kiya gaya he ki ab belout kii jagah bank bel-in kaa sahaara le sakengi
 Hence, as the problem of npas of banks intensifies, the new resolution corporation will decide how much money a customer can withdraw from the bank's deposited money and how much money can be given to the bank to bridge its NPA
 udhaaharan ke taur par maujuuda samay membank main seaving khatemen pade aapke ek lakh rupee ko aap jab chahen or jitna chahen nikaal sakate hai
 But after the new law comes, the central government will decide through the new corporation how to allow customers to withdraw money in times of economic crisis and how much of their savings can be used to bridge the dirty debts of banks

 But if the story ends there, it was still a honor
 hakeekat ye he ki kahani to uske baad shuru hoti he

 You have just seen one pawn of Baghdadi
 abhi wo doosraa mohara to baaki hi he jiske dimag main pichley 3 saalon main itnaa zehar bhar diya he ki wo ab marane maarane ko taiyaar ho chukaa he
 By giving his life, he will tell the message of the horror of Baghdadi

 Hajit Ali used to visit Khawatin at the tomb until before 2012, but after that the Haji Ali Dargah Trust banned entry to the inner part of the Aurite citing traditions
 yun to isi islamic parampara main inhen dargahon ko gair islamic kaha jaataa he lekin mazahab ko wo rup jise log gadhate hai un par logon kaa adhikaar zyada hona chahie
 On Friday, the Bombay High Court said that women should be allowed to go to the inner womb
 dargah trust or rajya ko zimmedaari di gai he ki wo vahaan jane vaali mahilaon kii suraksha kaa bhi khyaal karenge
 The Bench of Justice VM Kanade and Justice Revathi Mohite Dere has said that ban on entry of women is a violation of Articles 14, 15 and 19
 artical 14 main kanoon kii nazar main sabko samaan mana gaya he, artical 15 kii nazar main dharmik aadhaar par bhedbhaav karne kii manaahi he, artical 21 vyaktigat jivan or azaadi kii suraksha kii guarantee detaa he
 The state government had put forward its stand, saying that unless the dargah trust proves that there was a restriction according to the Quran, women should be allowed to leave
 bhartiya muslim mahila sangh ne kaha he ki muslim mahilaon ke liye yah badi jeet he

 Around 15000 Dalits had gathered from around 2 March 1930, including 500 women
 kai logon kii giraftaar bhi hui thi jisamen sitabai or ramabai bhi thim
 Later Dr
 Ambedkar had clarified that the temple entry movement was not done because i wanted the deprived sections to become idol worshipers or that they would become part of Hindu society by entering temples and they would get equal
 doctor ambedkar kaa kahana tha ki samanta ke adhikaar se hamen vanchit kiya gaya he uske khilaaf ye satyagrah tha
 My aim was to awaken the deprived society towards its rights
 uske baad doctor ambedkar kisi mandir pravesh andolan kaa samarthan nahin kiya

 november 1936 main kerala ke travnakor main vahaan ke maharaja ne travnakor sarkaar ke tahat aane vaale sabhi mandiron ko sabhi ke liye khol diya tha
 While there, the question of temple entry was being raised since the year 1919

 Otherwise we will again make the same mistake as we have done in history

 By which logic should they be stopped from reaching a particular place, it is justified
 par is jeet ko haazi ali dargah tak hi simit rakhana thik nahin hoga
 The comments jo sanstha isaki ladaai lard rahi he uske kuch or bhi sawaal hai, jo haazi ali dargah main pravesh se kahin zyada talkh or muslim samaaj ke bheetar mardon ke varchasv ko chunauti dete hai

 Akhilesh was going to attend the swearing-in ceremony of the Students' Union of Allahabad University
 unhen ek chartered plane se prayagraj janaa tha lekin unhen yah kehete hue roak diya gaya ki sapa netaa ne isaki ijaajat nahin lee he
 This incident can not be called big only because a former Chief Minister was prevented from going to his own state, but this incident left its mark on a large scale because many parties and leaders who rejected the BJP and Modi government in favor of Akhilesh The bloc issued statements and expressed support
 khud akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki upi sarkaar unase itnaa dar gai he ki vah unhen ek program main shaamil hone se roak rahi he
 The response was not limited to Akhilesh alone
 sapa or basapa main gathbandhan he, lihaaja basapa supremeo mayawati bhi is siyaasi maidan main kud padin or ise bhaajapa sarkaar kii taanaashaahee or loktantr kii hatya kaa pratik qaraar diya
 Mayawati said in a tweet, "the incident of the Samajwadi Party (SP) President and former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav not being allowed to go to Allahabad on Tuesday to stop him at Lucknow airport itself is highly condemnable and the BJP government's dictatorship and Democracy symbolizes murder
 "unhone sawaal kiya ki kya bhaajapa kii centre or rajya sarkaar basapa-sapa gathbandhan se itani zyada bhaybheet or baukhala gai he ki unhen apni raajnneetik gatividhi or party program karne par bhi roak lagane par vah tul gai he
 Looking at the easy events of the BJP, it is the third incident which has forced the BJP to be on the backfoot and has made the easy issue of opposing the Grand Alliance
 bijepi yaa uski sarkarein bhale safai den ki kaam vahi ho rahaa he jo tarksangat he lekin mahagathbandhan dal ise apane mutabik bhunaane main koi kotahi nahin barat rahe
 Tuesday's incident may be legal or administrative action for the Yogi government but it is clear from the statements of Akhilesh and Mayawati that the BJP government has come down to 'dictatorship'
 chunavi sijan he or isamen sarkaar ke ek-ek kadam kii baariki se scrootni hogi
 Regardless of whether the action is administrative, political matters will be extracted from it
 isliye mukhyamantri yogi kaa yah kathan bahut myne nahin rakhata ki suraksha kii sthiti na bigade, isliye akhilesh ko roka gaya
 The Chief Minister also said that SP should desist from its chaotic activities
 bakaul yogi, "prayagraj main kumbh chal rahaa he

 Now Prayagraj district administration has expressed apprehension that violence may occur

 The Prime Minister associated Naidu's son with 'wealth Creation' and 'sun Rise' (rising sun) with son's rise
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke aaropon main kitni sachai he or kitni milawat, isaki vivechna baad main hogi lekin fori taur par mahagathbandhan ke dalon ne naidu kaa saath diya or dilli main manch par aise kai netaa jute jo modi sarkaar or bijepi ko pani pi-pi kar koste hai
 Naidu was heard saying that "modi is threatening everyone, the opposition, bureaucrats, corporates and even the media
" vah vipakshiyon or virodhiyon ke khilaaf sibiai, idi or iskar vibhaag ko laga rahe hai
 "they said," We want to save democracy
 aaj desh ko bachaane ke liye sabhi partiyon kaa ekasaath aana loktantric majaburi he
 "it is clear from Naidu's talk that his fast was merely symbolic
 asli nishaanaa un dalon ko ek saath laana tha jo modi sarkaar ke khilaaf hai or vipakshi partiyon kaa rutaba rakhti hai
 Just then, calling on the opposition parties to unite, Naidu said that "we have to keep this in mind
 modi ko purna bahumat diya gaya tha
 What did they do? nothing
 bhaajapa or modi yah puch kar ki aapkaa netaa koun he, vipaksh ko baantne kaa khel khel rahe hai
 "naidu spoke a lot more but by evening, the world and the world saw that the opposition is united and against the Modi government
 isse bijepi ko kya mila, yah sochneey he lekin naidu or vipaksh ko jo sahanubhuti mili, use sabane jarur dekha

 For the first time in the history of the country, the sword of arrest of a top official of a government agency was hanged and the state police was seen in a domineering manner
 in sabake baavjood vipaksh ekajute hua or bijepi, modi sarkaar va sibiai ko nishane par lete hue yah kaha gaya ki dilli main baithe narendra modi ke ishaare par sabakuch ho rahaa he
 The Chief Minister of the state sat on a dharna saying that the 'federal structure' is being ruined
 mamata ne dharne kaa naam bhi kaaphi soch samaj kar 'samvidhan bachaao' dharna rakhaa
 However, as soon as the political issues were resolved, he ended the picket and said, "on the request of all opposition parties, i have decided to end the picket
 mujhe koi dikkat nahin he
 i have fasted here for 26 days before
 main singoor main 14 dinon tak dharna de chuki hum lekin hamen kam se kam ek loktantric santhaan se nyaay mil gaya he
 "the court directed the CBI not to arrest Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajiv Kumar but he would be questioned
 yah alag baat he ki bijepi ne poochtacha ko apni jeet bataaya to mamata banerjee kii party trinmul ne rajeev kumaar kii giraftaar par roak ko apni jeet mana
 Whatever be the case, these recent events have taken a heavy toll on the BJP and have given opportunities to the Mahagathbandhan to put his point in front of the people

 Till now everything was fine, but the most surprising thing happened when the result of this exam came

 According to the Election Commission, these examinations were held on August 18 at five centers in the state, including Bhopal, in which a total of 561 officers, including officers of the IAS, the state administrative service and the revenue department, attended

 The question is whether in the earlier elections he did duty in an impartial manner

 Former cricketer Virender Sehwag on Thursday shared a photo of a 12-year-old boy, one of India's youngest freedom fighters, on his social media account on Children's Day
 british sainikon dwaara 12 saal ke baaji raut (baji Raut) kii goli markar hatya kar di gai thi, kyonki unhone ek nadi ke paar karne se manaa kar diya tha
 Virender Sehwag wrote about the incident of the murder of Baji Raut in 1938, writing, "on 10 October 1938, the British police arrested some people and brought them to Bhubaneswar police station
 inaki rihaai kii maang jor pakadaaey lagi
 The police opened fire on the protesters, killing two people
 logon ke badhate aakrosh ko dekh police ne brahmani nadi ke nilkanth ghat hote hue dhencanal kii ore bhaagane kii koshish kii
 These people reached the river bank soaked in rain
 baaji raut nadi tat par naav ke saath the
 He was ordered to cross
 ''sahvaag ne bataaya, ''baaji ne sena ke julmon kii kahani sun rakhi thi
 He flatly refused to cross the army
 sainikon ne unhen maarane kii dhamkee di
 On disobeying the orders, a soldier hit his head with the butt of the gun, he collapsed in blood and then stood up and refused to cross the British
 12 saal kaa baaji na to unase daraa or na hi bhaaga, balki dridhtaa se unka muqabla kiya
 British soldiers could not assess his bravery and patriotism
 baaji ke man main deshbhakti kii bhaavana kootakar bhari thi jiskaa parinaam yah niklaa usne balidaan dena sweekaar kiya par angrejon ke aage jhukna sweekaar nahin kiya
 Angry British soldiers riddled Baji Raut with bullets
 is dauraan baaji ke saath gaanv ke lakshmana malik, phagu sahu, harshi pradhan or naata malik bhi maare gaye
 "virender Sehwag finally wrote," India's youngest martyr child definitely deserves more recognition
 sabase bahadur bachche main se ek baji raut ko salaam
 '' On this # childrensday it's time we know about Shaheed Baji Rout, from Nilakanthpur in Orissa, the youngest Martyr of India's freedom struggle
 At the age of 12,this young boy was on guard of a country boat and was ordered by the British troop to ferry them across river Brahamani 
 Baji who had already heard the details of the brutality of the troop which had killed innocent people in the village understood if the British troops were to be obstructed, then they needed to be stopped from going across to the other bank
 He therefore refused to ferry them across
 The troop threatened to kill him if he did not ferry them across immediately
 Baji however rejected their orders
 One of the British soldiers hit Baji's head with his gun butt that fractured his skull severely
 Baji collapsed,, but he rose again gathering whatever little strength and courage was left with him, and raising his voice to the highest pitch beyond even his strength, warned the British troops not to ferry them till alive
 a soldier pierced his bayonet into the soft skull of Baji, Another British soldier started firing ruthlessly
 While one of the bullets hit Baji and he lay dead, his other friends Laxman malik,fagu Sahoo, Hrushi Pradhan & Nata Malik were also killed
 India's youngest martyr definitely deserves more recognition
 Salute to one of he bravesrt child
 a post shared by Virender Sehwag (@virendersehwag) on nov 13, 2019 at 10:14 pm PST It goes on to state that Baji Raut was born on October 5, 1926 in a poor Khandayat family in Neelkanthpur village in Dhenkanal district of Odisha
 odisha sarkaar kii website ke anusaar, unhone apane pita ko kam umr main kho diya or unki maa ne alag-alag gharon main kaam kiya

 iske baad renuka ne kaha- kyonki tanmay or anuraag imployar hai, main nahin hum
 None of my employees have complained about Alok Nath

 On Saturday, a spate of questions and answers arising over the terrorist attack in Pampore have not yet calmed down that another controversy arose
 darasal sirarpief or army ke bich aatankwaadiyon ko maarane ko lekar tanatani dekhi gai
 There was a dispute about who killed the terrorists in Pampore everyday
 CRPF or Army soldiers? The whole matter seems to be narrowing around taking credit
 army kaa kahana he ki usne do aatankiyon ko maar giraaya, jabaki siarpief ne is baat kaa virodh kiya or kaha ki 'shrey lene ke liye kiya gaya daawa galat' he
 The CRPF is saying that Army personnel reached the spot when the encounter was over
 siarpief ke mutabik, javaanon ne ghatnasthal par pahunchane ke baad maare gaye aatankiyon ke saath selfi leni shuru kar di
 Shortly thereafter, the Army's Northern Command tweeted: # jkops Army killed two terrorists who attacked a CRPF bus in Pampore, Kashmir

 "sakshi has been living in Mumbai for almost a decade and most of the time her parents live with her
" unka ek bhai or bahan he lekin unhen lagata he ki unhen sabase zyada laad-pyaar mila he
 She says, "family is very important to me

 They believe that when i feel that now is the right time, i will get married
 ’’ sakshi us vakt ko yaad karti hai jab unke pita ne ek sambhavit ladke se meeting tay kii or usne poocha ki shaadi ke baad ve kab kaam karnaa chhod dengi
 Without immediately missing a moment, she immediately said, "when will you leave work!" And thus the story ended

 "witnesses believe that working with Ram is a great experience
" unke zyaadaatar seen swaabhaavik hai, patakatha peeche chhot jaati he or ham aage badhate jate hai

 tab se 13 saal guzar gaye par aaj bhi unke sambandh majboot bane hue hai
 Recently, it looks very good that his status in the production houses has been restored again due to the successful success
 industry main kaha jaataa he ki ekta ke saath kaam karnaa aasaan nahin he
 So, how does Sakshi interact with him? "balaji is now like my family
 vah ab aisi jagah nahin he jahaan aap jaao, kaam karo or laut aao
 Ekta is a professional and her focus is on her work
 haa, ve kaam ke maamle main koi riyaayat nahin deteen, hard taskmaster hai! hon bhi kyon nahin? unki tarah kathin mehnat or lagan ke saath kaam karne vaala koi bhi chahega
 
 
 
 agar main bhi unki jagah hoti to main bhi vahi karti
 If you are devoted to a project or show, then you will be able to spend a few hours and complete it professionally
 agar aap vaisaa nahin karte ho or koi is par kuch kahata he to uskaa kahana jaij he
 "but they are not the same as seen in the media from photographs taken from Sakshi's album
" ve kahati hai, ‘‘log kehete hai ki main bahut-si partiyon or kaaryakramon main nahin jaati
 i am a domestic type, a bit lazy too, when i feel that the matter is of importance, i only go
 ’’bhaag-daud se doorjyaadaatar abhinayta-abhinetriyaan balaji ke project main dobaaraa mili maukey ko fouran lapak leti hai lekin sakshi ko bade achche lagate hai main priya kii bhoomika ke liye raji karne main ekta ko kuch vakt laga
 Sakshi says, "after working day and night for eight years, i wanted to spend some time peacefully without any work
 jaise subah uthun to lage ki aaj din kaa koi kaarykram yaa agenda nahin he
 Story for eight years
 
 
 ke dauraan maine itnaa kaam kiya jo duusare log 16 saal main karte kyonki ham roj kaam karte or ek bhi episod mere bina nahin tha
 It is not correct to say that i did not get holidays, but there was work pressure
 main chaahati thi ki chaun se ghumun, chhuttiyaan bitaane jaaun, main ‘‘apana vakt’’ bitaauun, main apane parivaar, doston ke saath rahanaa chaahati thi, filmein dekhnaa chaahati thi, pair failaakar aaraam karnaa chaahati thi
 And that's what i did for two and a half years
 ’’ use ve apane jivan kaa sabase badhibia faisla maanati hai
 Every day when there are many good opportunities, did not he worry that new actors would get a chance and the stardom would end? The witness admits, "you need courage to do nothing
" haa, mere man main andeh uth rahe the
 
 
 But i did not want to do something conditionally as i had done
 
 
 main bataur actor aage nahin bad rahi thi
 "good girl, bad role
 When she was asked to play a villain-like lady in Balika Vadhu, it was a big" challenge "for her
 us anokhe anubhav ke bare main sakshi bataati hai, ‘‘maine sochaa, actor ke rup main mere liye yah mahatvapurn kaam hoga
 It was 180 degrees reversed from my first roll
 isse mujhe acha mauka mila par mujhe yah ehsaas bhi hua ki mujhe apni acting main sudhaar karne kii jarurat he
 However, Sakshi's first role (kahani Ghar Ghar Ki Ki) was so positive and inspiring — absolutely cow-like — that her new avatar was not liked by the audience
 apni pasandida ‘‘bahu’’ ko khalanayika ke rup main dekhnaa unhen nahin bhaayaa
 But actress Sakshi says that this will not prevent her from doing such roles in future
 parde par or asli jindagi main sakshitelevijan ke do behad lokapriy serialon main parvati or priya ke rup main chote parde kii sabase charchit kalakaar sakshi tanvar asli jindagi main khud ko kis paatr ke aasapaas paati hai? fouran jawaab aata he, ‘‘beshak, bade achche lagate hai kii priya ke! hamaare desh main log kisi ko uske rishton se jodakar dekhne ke aadi hai
 When i was Parvati, i used to be the ideal wife, daughter-in-law, in the end, the question came that i am also a person
 priya ke paatr main acchhee baat yah he ki vah sabase pehle ek aurat kii tarah bolti he or phir vah patni, maa, bhabhi, bahu vagairah he
 In one episode, Priya's sister-in-law Natasha wants to divorce her (priya's) brother and Priya supports him
 ’’ ve kahati hai, ‘‘koi aurat aise purush ke saath kyon rahe jiske saath vah khush nahin he? yah aaj kii aurat kii aawaaj he
 Priya (the character of Sakshi in Bade Achhe Lagte Hain) is a working, independent, late-married, mother of a child, this character expresses the sentiments of today's urban women and through this i am both single and married
 i can connect with ’’ sakshi vah daur yaad karti hai jab striyaan unase kaha karti thim ki unki saas unase ‘‘parvati’’ jaisaa banane ko kahati hai
 She says, "but today, instead of" i want to be like Parvati ", she has started saying" i am like her (priya)! "this is a big change and the freshness of real life, it is It is not just a matter of hairstyle, makeup, etc
 ’’ zyaadaatar shahari auraten unke is paatr (priya) main apana aks dekhati hai
 Sakshi feels very good that the other good thing in Priya is that she speaks her mind just like him
 ve kahati hai, ‘‘saas, pati, apane parivaar yaa kisi duusare se baat karte hue vah yah nahin sochati ki ‘yah kehane se rishte tut jaaenge’, yah ekadam aaj ke jaisaa, mere jaisaa he
 "let life set the path
 They have not made any plans for the future
" unka maananaa he ki jindagi ek safar he or vah jaisi he use usee rup main sweekaar karnaa chahie
 She says, "I didn't even know that i would be here
" kahani ghar ghar kii ke daur main bhi sochaa karti thi ki ekaadh saal karuungi or phir nikal jaaoongi
 i am not very ambitious
 main jisamen man nahin lag rahaa ho, vah kar paane ko khud ko taiyaar nahin kar paati
 "there was a time when acting was everything for Sakshi
" vah ekadam subah shooting ke liye jaaya karatin or ghanton vahiin bitaayaa karatin or phir agle din kii shooting ke bare main sochaa karti thim
 But he believes that a break is necessary to organize things
 ‘‘us vakt har koi mujhase kahata tha ki main achche ofer thukrakar apane ko ‘‘barbaad’’ kar rahi hum
 But i knew that i would be relaxed even if i would not get anything

 dekhnaa hoga ki kya congress iske liye taiyaar hoti he yaa phir wo akele hi aage kaa rasta tay karegi? Madan Tamang, president of the All India Gorkha League (AIGL) and an ardent advocate of Gorkhaland, was killed by unknown assailants in Darjeeling city
 darjeeling jile ke magistrate surindra gupta ne bataaya ki tamang par plantres club ke najadik us samay khukhri or talavaaron se hamalaa kiya gaya jab vah aaj hone vaali ek baithak ke intjaamon kaa jayja le rahe the
 a clash broke out between AIGL supporters and GJM activists opposing the meeting, leading to five rounds of firing by the police
 gupta ne kaha ki golibari main koi ghayal nahin hua he
 However, GJM general secretary Roshan Giri said that some of his supporters were injured in the clash and one of the supporters was shot

 Murshidabad, situated on the banks of the Hooghly River, was known as the capital of Bengal during the Mughal period

 In 1716, Murshid Kali Khan was conferred with the title of Nawab of Bengal State and thus Murshidabad became the capital of Bengal

 christmas ke din pradhanmantri narendra modi jab navaj sharif ko unke janmdin par badhai dene or unki nathin kii shaadi par aashirwad dene achaanak lahore pahunche, to yah maheene bhar chali us athak kootnithik kavayad kaa nirnaayak pal sabit hota dikh rahaa tha jis dauraan “dushman maaro” se lekar “pappi jhappi” tak kai maukey aae jinase guzarate hue donon desh ek baar phir baatcheet kii prakriya main shaamil ho sake the
 a week later, on New Year's Day, the excitement was shattered when armed militants from across the border entered Pathankot's Air Force base, though their deadly attempts to destroy fighter jets and helicopters were thwarted
 kareeb 72 ghante tak chali ladaai main unhen maar giraaya gaya lekin is dauraan unhone bharat ke saat surakshakarmiyon ko bhi maut kii neend sula diya or aise aatanki hamalon se nibatane kii hamaari aadhi-adhuri taiyaariyon kaa pardaafash kar daalaa
 After this, there was an uproar over the betrayal of Pakistan across the country and Kargil and the 26 / 11 Genie came out of the bottle, which in front of Modi was the most difficult in foreign policy since May 2014
 Presented a challenge is silsile kaa ant purvavarti patakatha jaisaa hi hona tha&janvari ke madhya main hone vaali videsh sachiv stareey vaarta kaa talanaa, aatank par lagaam ksaa janaa or pakistan ke vishwasghaat kaa hawala dete hue antarrashtriya sahyog ko jutanaa
 After such familiar ups and downs, it seemed that Modi had come to know the intentions of his neighbor
 modi ke aalochak pakistan ke sandarbh main unki videsh niti ko dhulmul qaraar dete rahe hai
 It is good that Modi did not do the work that was expected
 na unhone mutthi kasi, na chaati piti
 Instead, every reaction of his government appeared to be niggling and dilapidated
 nateezaah mumbai ke 26 / 11 hamale se ulat pakistan is baar is baat se inkaar nahin kar sakaa ki pathankot par hamalaa karne vaale aatanki pakistani nahin the
 After this, Pakistan's National Security Advisor Nasir Khan Janjua called his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval and said that he was ready to take further action on any clues provided by India
 iske baad colombo yatra par gaye sharif ne modi ko phone kiya or janjua kii baat ko doharaate hue chintaa jataai
 Modi kept all his options open as to how and when to proceed in talks with Pakistan
 ahm baat yah thi ki modi ko ab samaj main aa rahaa tha ki pakistan main kisase or kis tareeke se baat kii jaani he
 As the first sub-military force came to power, Modi won a diplomatic victory by sending an invitation to Sharif, including the leaders of South Asia, at his swearing-in ceremony and indicated his policy of "putting neighbors first"
 pakistan ke saath samvaad ke madhyam se modi apni ugr rashtravaadi chhavi ko sudhaarney kii koshish kar rahe the
 He was clear that Pakistan is important for its 3C policy ie contact, connectivity and cooperation, because without its cooperation, this policy could not have taken care
 sharif hameshaa se bharat ke saath rishton kii behatari ke hami rahe hai, lihaaja unke liye modi kaa nyotaa gharelu str par apni chhavi ko durust karne kaa ek avasar tha
 Like Modi, he too came to power in 2013 with an overwhelming majority, but he also made only fraudulent promises
 sharif ke tisare kaarykaal ko pakistani fouj bahut satarkta ke saath barat rahi thi, khaskar jab unhone purv raashtrapati or fouj ke mukhiya general parvej musharraf se pratishodh liya, jinhone 1999 main unka takhtapalat karke unhen saudi arab main siyaasi nirvaasan main bhej diya tha
 In revenge on Musharraf, Sharif ignored the warnings of top military officials
 pehali baar kisi pakistani general ko kathghare main khadaa kiya ja rahaa tha-jisaki keemat unhen jald hi chukaani padi
 The army intensified the attack on the government by instigating Imran Khan, and through political demonstrations, Sharif's government was helpless
 november, 2013 main fouj kii kaman jab raahil sharif ke haath main ai, to navaj ke chune jane ke baavjood unhone jald hi apana rang dikhaanaa shuru kar diya
 His image is of a cold-minded soldier who proves himself with his work and speaks less
 raahil ne pakistani hiton ke virdohi ativaadee samoohon ke saath sharif kii baatcheet kii niti par sawaal khadey karne shuru kar die
 The military began to assert its dominance over internal security and foreign policy issues, and Sharif was affectionately expressed to quietly pay attention to the country's economy
 rukii hui baatcheet, khaskar kashmir ke maamle main samvaad bahaali par bharat kii ore se kisi bhi vachanabaddhata ke bagaiyr modi ke shapath grahan samaaroh kaa nyotaa sharif dwaara saharsha sweekaar kiya janaa pakistani fouj ko raas nahin aayaa tha
 In the last days of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's tenure, India refused to resume dialogue with Pakistan until it takes action against the 26 / 11 conspirators, frequent ceasefire violations on the loc
 But does not prohibit and does not establish peace on the outskirts
 pakistani fouj afghanistan main bharat kii sanlagnta ko lekar bhi chintit thi, jise vah apana ranneetik pichhawada maanati rahi he
 That is why the Pak army created a stir again in Kashmir to warn India to stay away from there
 fouj ne chintaa jataai thi ki modi ke shapath grahan samaaroh main gaye navaj ne hurriyat ke netaaon se mulaakaat nahin kii
 That is why when in August 2014, Modi decided to send the then foreign secretary Sujatha Singh to Islamabad for a dialogue restoration strategy, then the Pakistani army had decided to sabotage this exercise
 pakistani ucchayukta abdul basit ko hurriyat netaaon ko aamantrit karne ko kaha gaya taaki unase kashmir ke masale par raay lee ja sake or use videsh sachiv stareey vaarta main uthaaya ja sake
 The Hurriyat had been talked about in the past as well and most of the officials from Pakistan had been communicating with them
 modi or unke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal ko haalanki yah baat nahin pachi, saath hi congress ne bhi pakistan ke maamle main naram rukh par unki aalochana shuru kar di
 Accusing Islamabad of infusing the Hurriyat as a third party in the process of dialogue, Modi abruptly canceled the Foreign Secretary level talks
 sharif ke liye vaarta kaa radd kiya janaa nijee jhatka tha, kyonki unhone modi ke shapath grahan samaaroh main bharat aakar ek bada siyaasi daanv khelaa tha
 For the Pakistani army, however, it was a victory, as it prevented its civilian government from going into the process of dialogue and thus gaining dominance with its worst enemy country
 baatcheet radd karne se modi ko apane dakshinpanthi kheme ke bheetar bhale hi saraahna mili ho lekin is ghatana par antarrashtriya takaton ke bich ghabrahat kaa maahaul tha
 He felt that Modi had started well, but in the middle he was wandering the way
 aane vaale maheenon main modi ko ehsaas hua ki baatcheet radd karnaa to aasaan kadam tha
 Instead, it was a difficult task to resume the conversation and it was more difficult to deal with the Pakistani army
 doosraa sabakpakistan ke liye pehla masalaa kashmirmodi ne jab november, 2014 main saarc shikhar sammelan ke dauraan kathmandu main sharif se baat kii thi, us vakt sambandhon main jami barf pighali nahin thi
 For the first time after the end of the Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections, Modi started an honest effort to restore dialogue
 pakistan ne assembly chunaavon main baadha daalane kaa koi gambhir prayaas isliye nahin kiya kyonki use bharosa tha ki mufti mohammad said or unki party pidipi spasht bahumat ke saath satta main aa jaaegi
 Saeed spoke on the need to build bridges of relations with Pakistan and Islamabad was looking at him as his ally
 hua yah ki ghati main to pidipi kaa kabja ho gaya lekin jammu main bijepi kii jeet hui
 Contrary to Pakistan's expectation, for the first time in the history of the state, a joint government of PDP and BJP came to power in March 2015, allowing the Modi government to intervene more in state issues and strengthen India's hand in dealing with Pakistan
 assembly chunaavon ke thik baad videsh sachiv es
 Jaishankar formally moved to Islamabad in the name of SAARC Yatra but his real objective was to know the atmosphere there
 bharat kii purv shart yah thi ki samvaad bahaali ke liye vah taiyaar to he lekin pehle 26 / 11 ke shadyantrkariyon par karrwai ho, seemaa par aman kaayam ho or or aatank ko roka jaae
 This order was more important for the Modi government - terrorism had to be discussed first
 iske baad hi kashmir samet anya muddon par baat ho sakati thi
 In such a situation, a big opportunity came when Modi and Nawaz met during the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit meeting in Ufa, Russia in July last year and both agreed to start talks
 is prakriya main sabase pehle donon deshon ke suraksha salaahkaaron ko dilli main aatankwaad par baat kerani thi, jiske baad videsh sachivon ko milakar yah tay karnaa tha ki kashmir samet anya masalon par kaise aage badha jaae
 The joint statement issued here did not mention Kashmir
 navaj jab desh laute to fouj pramukh ne is par apni niraashaa jaahir kii
 After this Pakistan began to back down from its promises and it was clear that it wanted to end the process in some way or the other
 usne maang kii ki videsh sachiv bhi saath hi mulaakaat karen or yah jod diya ki rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar sartaaj ajij pehle hurriyat se milenge
 The Ufa process proved to be useless and the setback proved to be an embarrassment to Modi
 iske baad ek or mauka tab aayaa jab modi or navaj sitambar main sanyukt raashtra mahasabha kii baithak main neuyork pahunche
 Indian intermediaries spoke to Pakistani counterparts
 sartaaj ajij dobhaal se milane ko raji ho gaye lekin saath hi ve videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj se bhi milanaa chaahate the
 India stuck to it and the attempt failed
 ek adhikari bataate hai, bharat ko laga ki “ajij kisi samaadhaan kii ore badaae ke utane icchhuk yaa rachanaatmak nahin the
 After this, Pakistan made a significant change, making Janjua a security adviser
 janjua fouj ke ek purv commander hai, jo baluchistan ke baagiyon se nibat chuke hai
 He has the trust of both Raheel and Nawaz
 isse pakistani fouj bhi bharat ke saath vaarta kii mej par aa sakati thi
 After this, when the two heads of state went to the climate change conference in Paris, Modi took the initiative
 navaj se lounj main hui do minute kii baatcheet main modi ne unhen bataaya ki sushamaa swaraj islamabad main heart of asia sammelan main jaaengi or vahaan samvaad bahaali par baat karengi lekin usase pehle donon suraksha salaahkaaron ko mil lenaa chahie
 Sharif agreed and within a week the two security advisors met in Bangkok to stay away from Delhi's media and avoid the issue of meeting Hurriyat
 donon videsh sachiv bhi maujuud the, lekin jaishankar ne saaf kiya tha ki ve donon mukhya vaartakaron ke sahyogi ke bataur hi maujuud hai
 The two security advisors kept talking for four hours
 is dauraan dobhaal hi sabase zyada bole
 He conveyed India's concerns and made it clear that India has enough evidence to act on the relationship between Pakistan and the terrorists
 janjua ne kaha ki pakistan khud hi aatankiyon ke hamale jhel rahaa he or unhone dobhaal ko har tarah ke sahyog kaa aashwaasan diya
 When Sushma Swaraj reached Pakistan, she was given a tremendous welcome and Sharif introduced her to her family
 donon desh kashmir samet sabhi lambit muddon ke samaadhaan ke liye samgr dwipaksheeya samvaad prakriya behaal karne par raji hue
 India wanted to put the word "bilateral" in it so as to prevent Pakistan from making it trilateral in future and hurling the Hurriyat as a third party
 pakistan ne bina yah sakshya die ki vah aatankwaad ko rokane kii koshish kar rahaa he, kashmir ko vaarta kii mej par laane main kamyaabi hasil kar lee
 Modi's surprise visit to Lahore served to further strengthen this process
 yah kootneeti kaa aisa anaupchaarik kadam tha jo na sirf navaj ke liye tohfa tha balki pakistan main chhavi ko sudhaarney kii modi kii kavayad se niklaa tha
 Third Subpakistan Not Uniform Unit The attack of Pathankot is a clear indication that Pakistan is not a uniform unit but there is more than one internal aspect that India has to deal with and address them
 yah hamalaa modi kii lahore yatra kii pratikriya main nahin tha balki aisa lagata he ki maheenon pehle isaki yojana banaai gai thi
 Apart from this, a trend of such attacks has also emerged during the last few years
 jitani gambhir sanlagnta hogi utana hi hinsak uksaava hoga jo aatanki hamale ke rup main saamne aayega
 In this way, in 1999, after the historic visit of Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Lahore, the Pakistani army was attacked
 manmohan singh ke kaarykaal main jab vaikalpik vaartaon main kaaphi pragati ho chuki thi tabhi 26 / 11 ke hamale ne baatcheet ko barason peeche dhakel diya
 The statements issued by the Modi government after the Pathankot attack show that India will continue its dialogue with certain conditions
 yah ek acha sanket he kyonki samvaad kii prakriya ko behaal karne or modi kii lahore yatra ne pehle hi antarrashtriya str par bharat kii chhavi ko majboot kiya he or uskaa laabh bhi mil rahaa he
 Earlier, when India complained about the terrorist attacks of Pakistan, the big forces counted the lack of dialogue process
 pathankot ke baad sabhi deshon ne bharat ke saath sahanubhuti jataai he or unhone pakistan par karrwai karne ke liye dabaav banaaya he
 The question arises that what should be the extent of India to tolerate such attacks? Will any next attack break the communication process? There are apprehensions that terrorists will attack soft targets to disrupt the peace process
 paak fouj chori-chhipe tamaam aatanki samoohon ko apana samarthan detii rahegi
 Preliminary investigation has revealed that Pathankot was attacked by jaish-e-mohammed, not Lashkar
 jaisaa ki ek visheshgy kehete hai, bharat ke liye yah ek phislan bhari sthiti he-ham koi karwai karen yaa nahin, donon hi sthiti main hamen ninda jhelni he
 When we sat quietly, it meant that we gave up
 hamane tanaav ko badhaayaa to yah donon deshon ke liye tabaahi kaa sabab hoga
 As Sushma Swaraj said, "there is no alternative to war
 ” khaskar isliye kyonki donon desh parmaanu shakti sampann hai
 Modi will also have to pay attention to his criticism that he has no stable policy regarding Pakistan
 jaankaar maanate hai ki modi apane hisaab se niti ko gadhate hue chalate hai, ve aavegpurn or uttejk hai or bhavyata vaale karname karke yah maan lete hai ki unki is style main hi asal tatv he
 He advises them to develop advisors who can play the role of speed blocker so that Modi does not run in the middle of the cycle
 iske alaava apane kadamon se har baar peeche hatane se bhi ve bachein or uksaava chaahe jaisaa bhi ho, sanlagnta jari rakhi ja sake
 There are other reasons to be cautious
 masalan, raahil sharif pakistan main kaaphi taqatvar hokar ubhare hai
 He has become very popular in Karachi due to the implementation of the rule of law and his move against terrorists in FATA areas
 america or anya takatein unki kaabiliyat ko sweekaarti hai
 Global forces are considering Pakistan as important for the stability of Afghanistan and this increases the strength of Raheel Sharif
 aarthik galiyare kii apni yojana ke maddenjar china pakistan main khub paisa laga rahaa he
 The economy is looking good and Nawaz Sharif has struck a balance with his army chief
 lihaaja, pakistan kii saakh badi he or vah maanata he ki aaj kii taarikh main vah bharat ke saath saudebaaji karne kii takat rakhata he
 Negotiations with India give legitimacy to the military's side and allow it to maintain tension in a measured manner
 iske baavjood pakistan main tamaam aisi takatein or hai jo is uddeshy ke khilaaf kaam karti hai jinhen bharat ko pahchaanana chahie or unka dohan karnaa chahie
 Experts say that India should now put in place an interim arrangement that can keep its relations with Pakistan in one perspective till the disputes are resolved
 modi sarkaar parde ke peeche kii bachit main bharosa nahin karti he lekin bangkok main enese str kii hui shant kootneeti uske liye madadgaar rahi he
 The army wants to maintain tension so that its own position in Pakistan is strengthened and the emergence of India is prevented
 bharat ko apana mizaaj thanda rakhana hoga or tab tak ativaadee karrwai nahin kerani hogi jab tak ki yah bahut anivaary na ho jaae
 The Modi government has to give a cautious response so that it can draw maximum results from every meeting
 masalan, vaajapeyi ne 2004 main islamabad main saarc shikhar sammelan main jane se pehle musharraf se kuch vaade sunishchit kar liye the
 Modi will have to get such assurances before going to the SAARC summit this year
 padosiyon ko tarjeeh dene kii modi kii niti sahi patari par he or unhen samvaad main jode rakhane kaa unka sankalp bhi drudh he
 Modi has shown openness and flexibility in dealing with Pakistan which should be credited to him
 isse unhen ek apratyaashit padosi se nibatane ke kai vikalp mil jate hai
 As a top official has said, "it does not mean that we will not loose or take drastic action
" agar koi desh hamase uljhegaa, to use jawaab ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 " ol india majalis-e ittehadul muslimin (AIMIM) ke chif or loksabhaa saansad asaduddin ovaisi ke bayaan par vivaad gaharaata ja rahaa he
 Now on the statement of Owaisi, Bharatiya Janata Party leader Madhav Bhandari has said that he should speak thoughtfully
 itnaa hi nahin, ye naseehat dete hue bhandari ne yahaan tak kah diya ki ovaisi agar hissedari kii bhashaa bolenge to hissedari 1947 main de di gai
 After the Modi government came to power at the Center for the second time, Asaduddin Owaisi is reacting continuously
 is kadi main unhone kaha he ki agar koi ye samaj rahaa he ki hindustan ke piem 300 seat jeet kar desh par manamaani karenge to aisa nahin ho saktaa
 Owaisi has also said that we will keep Hindustan in abeyance, we are entitled to equal here, not tenant and shareholder
 bijepi netaa ne diya yah bayanowaisi ke isi bayaan par maharashtra ke bijepi netaa madhav bhandari ne pratikriya di he
 He has not only advised Owaisi to speak thoughtfully, but has also reminded India of partition of Pakistan after independence
 bhandari ne ovaisi ko jawaab dete hue kaha, 'unako kisi ne kirayedar nahin kaha, lekin hissedari kii bhashaa bolenge to hissedari 1947 main de di to maamla khatm ho gaya
 After the bjp's victory in the Lok Sabha elections 2019, PM Modi had talked about deceit with the minorities and keeping them fearful, to which Owaisi asked that if the PM feels that Muslims live in fear, will he Will stop the gangs who are killing Muslims in the name of cow
 is bayaan ke baad ovaisi ne desh ke musalamaanon kii baat karte hue kaha tha ki wo kirayedar nahin hai, balki hissedaar banakar rahenge
 On this same statement by Owaisi, Bhandari has said that no tenant is telling him, but the stake has been given in 1947
