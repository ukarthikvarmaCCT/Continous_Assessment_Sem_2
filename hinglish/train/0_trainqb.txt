 In UP, you saw bullets in the encounter
 andhere main bhi police waalon ko sahi nishaanaa lagaate dekha
 If there was no gun, i saw a bullet from my mouth
 bandook thi
 But i did not know how to drive
 wo bhi dekha
 But still you did not see anything
 kyonki jo ab dekhenge uske aage ye sari bandooken or goliyaan bekaar hai
 a inspector of UP falls in love
 mashooq ko saath lete hai or raat ke sannaate main nikal padate hai
 Suddenly, Mehbooba of the inspector sits on a request
 phir jo hua use jaanakar sab hairaan rah gaye
 So let's first read some verses in praise of this police officer of UP
 taaki puri kahani samajhane main aapako zahamat naa ho
 Janab's name is Nafees Ahmed
 hapur main upi police ke daroga ke taur par tainaat the
 But if Meerut is transferred, it is thought that as we go, we should salute the old relations
 bas isi maqasad se shaadishuda or do bacchon ke pita hone ke baavjood unhone apni is garlfriend ko milane bulaayaa
 The meeting took place in this happy atmosphere that even the romanticism of films had to be borne
 bas yun samajhie ki nafis sahab ne gaanaa nahin gaaya
 Otherwise the picture was completed
 baharhaal gaanaa unhone apane soshal media profile par aplod kar ke apni tamanna puri kar lee ab chunki alavida kehane se pehle kii ye aakhri mulaakaat thi
 Therefore, Nafees Saheb could not deny his girlfriend's stubbornness in which she asked him to shoot with a real government pistol
 bas phir kya pistal lod hui or thama diya nafis sahab ne apni garlfriend ke haathon main
 Now of course girlfriends are girlfriends
 chaahe wo kisi celebratti kii ho yaa thanedaar kii
 Kare The Girlfriend insisted on taking selfies with pistols and making videos while shooting
 garlfriend ko kaise manaa kar pate
 Therefore, Nafees Saheb also had to fulfill this stubbornness
 wo mahabuuba ko samajhane lage
 Grab it like this
 video band naa ho jaae itnaa dhyaan rakhana
 Let me go
 chalaa do
 My face should also come
 to itani dur pakad naa
 Press on aaen
 Please stay
 ab phase aa rahaa he
 The pistol is also coming
 dabaa duun
 You can press
 dabaao
 Squeeze out loud
 lao
 Come on
 udhar to baith jaao ja ke
 Do not skip the video cut
 are seve to kar do
 And in this way, the shot of love from the government pistol at the hands of the girlfriend was recorded in the camera
 wo bhi garlfriend ke mobile main
 In English, such videos are called girls swag
 aasaan zabaan main samajhen to ise itaraana kaha jaataa he
 It is obvious that a human cannot see himself
 lihaaza nafis sahab kii garlfriend kaa man chanchal ho gaya or unhone ise logon ko dikhaa diya or unheen main se kisi ne is video par haath saaf kar use soshal media ke zarie puure jamaane ko dikhaa diya
 What was it then
 upi police kaa ye daroga achaanak mashhoor ho gaya
 But with infamy
 to kahani sun lee or tasviren bhi dekh leen aapane
 Let us also listen to the story of Ishq
 koun kahata he ki police, thana, court kachhari bekaar jagah hoti he
 Love can also flourish in the police station and Daroga Nafees Ahmed has also proved this
 ek mahila apane pati ke khilaaf daroga sahab ke paas thane main shikaat likhaane ai thi
 Now that husband does not know, but the officer fell in love with his wife
 pyaar bhi aisa ki janata sarkari goli chalaane lagi
 It is a strange coincidence
 jab se upi main yogi ji kii sarkaar ai he
 Since then, the entertainment of UP Police has increased considerably
 kabhi koi daroga munh se goliyaan chalaane lagata he
 So sometimes someone forgets to use weapons
 to kabhi garlfriend se hi goli chalava detaa he
 However, it is important to know what is the reality of this video of Sub Inspector Nafees Ahmed, who was posted at Hapur village police station
 kyon wo apni garlfriend se sarkari pistal se goli chalava rahe hai
 And who is that girl who is being described as Nafees Ahmed's girlfriend? nafis sahab kii is yuvati ke saath kaa ye akelaa video nahin he
 Rather, there is another video of Nafees Ahmed and this girl
 haalanki wo dikhaane laayak nahin he
 At the same time, some objectionable pictures and chatting of Daroga Saheb are also viral on social media with this woman
 ye video jo ham aapako dikhaa rahe hai wo hapur ke nazadik raat ke vakt kisi sunsaan ilaake par sadak kinare shoot kiya gaya he
 After this video of Nafees Saheb went viral, there has been a stir in the entire police department
 aanan-fanan main daroga nafis relive hokar meerut ja chuke hai
 At the same time, after the matter came up, SP Hapur got it investigated by CO CT
 jiske baad sab inspector nafis ke nilamban kii sifarish hui
 And DIG Meerut also suspended him
 video kii jaanch ke baad ye paaya gaya ki pistal sarkari he
 But the person who is seen with the girl seen in the video is Daroga Nafees Ahmed or it is not clear at the moment
 lihaaza video main dikh rahi ladki se poochtacha kii ja rahi he
 Only after this, it will be clear who was present with the girl in the car and from whose official pistol he fired
 baharhaal jab daroga nafis ahamed ke fasebuk profile ko khangala gaya to kai hairaan karne vaali baaten pataa chalin
 In June last year, Nafees Ahmed shared many romantic songs and talks on his Facebook profile
 jisase ye zaahir hota he ki video main dikh rahi ladki se inaki abhi jald hi dosti hui he
 Upon investigation, it was found that the girl seen in the video is married and hapur's police station is from the countryside
 video main nazar aa rahi ladki kuch maheene pehle apane pati ke saath vivaad hone par nafis ke thane main shikaayat darj karaane gai thi
 After which the two began to mingle
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki donon main pyaar ho gaya
 But Daroga ji was so much in love that he forgot that he was posted in a government post
 sab inspector nafis ahamed ne apni vardi kii garima bhuulakar apni premika ko khush karne ke liye use sarkari pistal hi thama di
 Thankfully, there was no accident in the firing of Nafees Ahmed's girlfriend
 varanaa daroga kii mohabbat main koi naa koi maaraa jaataa
 However, this firing in the air has brought trouble to Nafees Saheb's job
 magar sawaal ye uthta he ki jis khaaki par janata kii suraksha kii jimmedaari he
 If the same khaki starts holding its pistol to others, what will happen to the safety of the people
 madhya pradesh vidhansabha chunaav mentikataka countdown shuru ho gaya he
 It is believed that by November 1, the BJPMP may announce tickets for the assembly elections
 lekin is bich bijepi ke rashtriya mahasachivakailash vijayawargiyane tikat vitaran bada bayaan diya he
 Talking to Aaj Tak, BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya bluntly said that the party is going to give a chance to new faces by cutting tickets of many old faces in the assembly elections
 darasal, kailash vijayawargeey bijepi ke vishesh jansampark abhiyaan ke tahat bhopal aae the or jab ajtak ne unase tikat bantwaare main puraane chehron ke naam kaate jane se judaa sawaal poocha to vijayawargeey ne kaha ki 'ham nae chehron ko mauka dete hai, is baar bhi denge
 Maybe when the new faces are given a chance, the tickets of the old ones will be cut
 'iske saath hi kailash vijayawargeey ne puraane naamon ko kaat kar nae chehron ko tikat dene kii baat ko sakaaratmak rup se dekhne ko kaha or bole ki jab vah khud or shivaraj singh chouhan yuva the tab bhi party ne unhen mauka diya to ab yuvaaon ko mauka kyon naa mili? vijayawargeey ke is bayaan se un khabaron ko bal mil rahaa he jisaki charchaa beete kai dinon semdhya pradeshke raajnneetik galiyaaron main ho rahi he ki bijepi kai puraane or bade naam vaale netaaon ke tikat is baar kaat rahi he
 The Congress tightened up on the statement of Tanjailash Vijayvargiya, saying that the BJP leaders have realized the declining mass base in Madhya Pradesh and hence are making such statements in view of the possibility of results before the election so that the defeat can be corrected
 To break someone else's head

 After this, the election results will be announced on 11 December

 In fact, on December 15 last year, the Supreme Court gave a big decision that there will be no liquor shops 500 meters from the National Highways and State Highways
 haalanki usamen yah bhi saaf kiya gaya ki jinke paas license hai unke khatm hone tak yaa 31 march 2017 tak jo pehle ho, is tarah kii dukaane chal sakengi

 The excise department is happy, the excise minister is happy and the state government is also happy because it is making money

 Senior Brahmin leader of BJP Ghanshyam Tiwari is constantly updating words like Haq, Adhikar and Swabhimaan on his Facebook page
 siyaasi lihaaj se agar ve in shabdon kii talkhi thodaa kam kar den or pradesh bijepi adhyaksh vasundhara raaje bhi thodi udaartaa ke saath inke arth nikaalen to shaayad aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav ke liye bijepi ekajute najar aae
 These days this Brahmin leader of Shekhawati has taken an aggressive stand
 haal hi main unhone ek brahman congressi netaa suresh mishra par manahani kaa daawa thok diya
 Mishra set up fake companies at Tiwari for Rs 500 crore
 ke farjivade kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 In response to this allegation, Tiwari had clearly said that "the shoulder belongs to someone else and the gun is in someone else's hand"
 '' yah maamla ab court main he
 On the other hand, the speculation of changing its Sanganer seat in the upcoming assembly elections has put an end to the announcement by Tiwari to contest from this seat
 is elaan se unhone ek tarah se apni party ko bhi sandesh de diya
 Tiwari's distance from the BJP leadership seems clear
 ve pradesh main hui suraaj sankalp yatra main raaje ke saath nahin dikhe
 However, in the last leg of the journey, definitely attended Jaipur
 itnaa hi nahin, jab bijepi kii suraaj sankalp yatra nikaali ja rahi thi to tiwadi devadarshan yatra nikaalkar 'apano' ko hi apni takat dikhaane nikal pade
 Baba Ramdev also came in his journey
 pichley dinon shekhavati ke shakambhari mata ke darbar main tiwadi ne badi sabha yojit kii, jisamen kareeb 15,000 brahman jamaa hue
 Ramdev, who reached this meeting, said that he had talked to Raje that he should take the capable and capable people along
 vaise kuch din pehle tiwadi kii raaje se mulaakaat hui thi
 But from the kind of aggressive mood Tiwari has, it seems that bitterness has not gone away even after the two leaders met
 haalanki tiwadi ne is mulaakaat ko party ko majboot karne kii charchaa se joda
 The reason for his displeasure is also clear
 jab pradesh main bijepi kaa netritv tay karne kii charchaa chal rahi thi, tab tiwadi or gulabchand kataaria kendriya prabharee captain singh solanki se mili the
 He then objected to the initiative of making Raje the state president
 haalanki bijepi main sheersh str par chali baithkon ke baad kataaria raaje ke naam par sahamat ho gaye
 Under the compromise formula, Kataria got the chair of the Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly
 raji hone ke peeche kataaria kii apni majaburi bhi thi
 In an old case, he was being rung by the CBI
 so, unhen sahaara chahie tha
 Kataria, who is stuck at the crossroads between politics and the CBI, left Tiwari in the balance and accepted Raje's leadership on the occasion, while Tiwari was eyeing the post of Leader of Opposition after Raje, as he was the bjp's deputy leader in the House
 tiwadi na sirf vipaksh ke netaa kii kursi se maharoom hue balki party kii rashtriya kaaryakarini main bhi unhen jagah nahin mili
 When asked questions about distance from Raje, Tiwari says, "maybe she doesn't want to take along
" '' haalanki ve turant saaf karte hai ki ''party kisi ek se bandhakar nahin chal sakati
 "his gesture was clearly towards Raje
 tiwadi kii fasebuk par ek news clip lagi hui he, ''jab shekhavat ne maharani ke samaksh ghutane nahin teke''shekhavati se taalluk rakhane vaale tiwadi ne 1971 se apane ko jansangh kii youth wing se joda tha
 Later they started on the path of student politics
 1980 main tiwadi sikar se pehali baar vidhayak bane
 Tiwari, who has been a five-time MLA and a minister twice, is senior in politics to Raje, but looks away from Raje for his rights, rights and self-respect
 raaje jab mukhyamantri thim, tab bataur mantri tiwadi ne sidhaa morcha khol diya tha
 The high command had to interfere in this matter

 Maharashtra government issued new guidelines to the police to avoid any ambiguity while imposing sedition-related IPC and not to impose it against people trying to bring about a change in the government in a legal way without rancor and hatred

 But later the case of treason was dropped

 From the ramparts of the Red Fort to Pakistan, the policy of the long-standing Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has become something similar now
 hameshaa kashmir ko lekar bharat ko jakhm dene vaale pakistan ko laal kile se hamaare pradhanmantri narendra modi ne sidhaa massej de diya he
 Like in tit style
 tum yadi kashmir ko lekar hallaa machaaoge to ham ab baluchistan par tumhen gherenge
 PM Modi has now made a slight change in his policy regarding Pakistan
 jaise pakistan kashmir-kashmir chillaata he vaise ab ham baluchistan, gilgit or pioke kii taraf apane kadam badhayenge
 If you become a headache for us, then we will make the people of your country in your biggest province through their path of non-violence
 padhein, PM bole- peshawar haadase par ham bhi dukhi hue
 
 
 Only last week, PM Modi made it clear that the time has come for Pakistan to answer to the world why it is persecuting the people of pok and Balochistan
 or usee ke tahat somvaar ko lalakile se piem ne puure desh ko sakshi maanakar baluchistan or 'pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir' kii 'aazaadee' kaa khule taur par samarthan kar diya
 See, pm's full speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort, PM Modi said on the 70th anniversary of independence, 'I also want to speak a little about the people of Balochistan, Gilgit and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
 ' modi ne kaha, 'duniya dekh rahi he
 The people of Balochistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir have thanked me in the last few days
 ' unhone kaha, 'main unka shukraguzaar hum
 'I am very happy with the manner in which the people of the Pakistani region have expressed my gratitude

 Pakistan and China are constructing Gwadar Port in Balochistan

 People of Balochistan are opposing it 4
 afghanistan or iran se milti he baluchistan kii seemaa5
 America's eye on China's activism in Balochistan is to see how much our changing policy on Pak will bring color

 The incident which took place in Kanker is a very punishable offense

 super powers ke liye afghanistan hameshaa se chunauti rahi he
 Russia tried to capture Afghanistan in 1979, but Afghanistan proved to be a death well for its army
 phir 9-11 hamale ke baad america ne afghanistan main punap rahe aatankwaad par lagaam lagane ke liye apni fouj utaari or beete do dashak se afghanistan uske liye doosraa vietnam ban chukaa he
 Now the new 'super power' China is eyeing Afghanistan
 china is raste asia par apni pakad banane kii kavayad kar rahaa he
 Is it now China, like Russia and the US, to fail in Afghanistan? Afghanistan will join CPEC 
 report ke mutabik china sarkaar apane van belt van road pariyojna ke tahat china pakistan iconomic coridor kaa dayera badhaate hue apane pariyojna kaa vistaar afghanistan main karegi
 The Chinese government is confident that Afghanistan is ready to join the project
 china ke videsh mantri wang i ne haal hi main bayaan diya he ki donon china or pakistan kaa mahatvapurn padosi afghanistan apni arthvyavastha ko majboot karne ke liye china pakistan iconomic coridor main jald se jald shaamil hona chahta he
 The Chinese government believes that if Afghanistan joins CPEC, it will become easier for it to connect CPEC to the Central and Western Economic Corridors
 duniya par kabja nahin jodne kaa kaam ho rahaa he: jinpinggauratlab he ki mangalvaar ko isi boaao forum for asia ke manch se raashtrapati shi jinping ne america se jari trade vivaad or duniyabar main uski aarthik vistaar niti ke virodh main uth rahi aawaaj par kaha ki mukt vaishvik kaarobaar kii disha main china dwaara uthaaya gaya kadam puri duniya ko ek saath baandhne kaa kaam karegaa
 At the same time, in defense of China's economic policies, Jinping argued that the path of China will never be closed for the countries to which China has given entry under its trade policy and this path will be further expanded in the coming days
 pakistan jaisi deal chahta he afghanistanchin or pakistan kaa maujuuda aarthik rishta afghanistan ko sipiisi main lubhaane kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 Pakistan gave China a part of Pakistan occupied Kashmir in 1963 and it brought friendship between the two countries
 pakistan ke is kadam ke baad lagaataar china sarkaar ne pakistan ke inphra deveopment main madad karne kaa kaam kiya
 It is because of this that for the last three years, China invested $ 62 billion in CPEC project for the economic development of Pakistan
 trade war: tisare vishwa yuddh ke liye taiyaar china kar saktaa he america par ye hamalaa bhiib china sarkaar pakistan main inphra devepalment ke sahare afghanistan main jagah banane kii taiyaari kii he
 Actually Afghanistan is a landlocked (without any coastline) country where communal strife and terrorism has taken place
 haalanki isi sampradayik kalah or antakawaad ke chalate 1970 ke baad ke dashakon main rus or america ke mansoobey yahaan vifal ho gaye
 As a result, Afghanistan topped the list of world's most dangerous places for global investors 
 bharat ke liye khatre kaa sanketachin afghanistan kaa sabase bada niveshak he
 China leased the copper mine in Aynaq, Afghanistan in 2007 for a 30-year lease under a $ 3 billion deal
 is mine se copper ko china pahunchane main lagbhag 6 maheene kaa samay lagata tha lekin donon deshon ne 2016 main railway line par samjhauta kar fret coridor taiyaar kar liya or ab mahaj do hafton main copper ko china pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 Due to this successful project, the Chinese government is giving Afghanistan a boost of fast economic growth

 He took all the money from the common people's pocket and put it in the banking system
 aashcharya kii baat he ki modiji(neerav modi) 22 hajaar karod rupee lekar faraar ho gaye
 The Prime Minister teaches the students for an hour and 45 minutes how to take the exam, but does not tell who is responsible for the money that Nirav Modi ran

 'asked when it all started in 2011? Rahul said, 'no, it was not so, most of the scam started in May 2015 and 90 percent of the financial transactions were done during the tenure of this government

 There have been many sensational revelations about a student accused of stabbing a first-grade student at Brightland School in Lucknow
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki aaropee chaatra kaa trek record bahut kharaab rahaa he
 She fled her home 6 months ago
 itnaa hi nahin apane haath kii nas kaat chuki he
 Earlier, during the examination, she also went home with a copy
 mahaj saatvin kaksha main padhane vaali chaatra skool main is tarah kii vaardaat ko anjaam degi, ye to kisi ne nahin sochaa tha, lekin uskaa record bahut hi kharaab rahaa he
 She also told the police that she wanted to be discharged at school
 isliye principal se milane ke bahaane chaatr ko toilet main le gai
 Tucked the cloth in his mouth and adopted him with knives
 iske baad usne toilet ke andar chaatr ko bandakar baahar nikal gai
 Incidentally, at the same time a teacher was passing near the toilet
 unhone peedit kii aawaaj sun lee
 Immediately the door opened, the student was soaked in blood
 skool prashasan ko suchit kiya gaya
 The student was then admitted to the hospital, where he gave information about the entire incident
 police adheekshak trans gomti harendra kumaar ko die bayaan main peedit chaatr ne bataaya, 'skool main prere hone ja rahaa tha
 i put my bag in class and started going to Prair
 tabhi didi mujhe jabardastee ghasitkar toilet main le gai
 While stabbing me, she was saying that she will kill you
 jabatak tum maroge nahin, skool main chuttee kaise hogi
 'that student had no enmity with the first class child
 vah apane skool kii is didi kaa naam bhi nahin jaanata tha
 Still, for a holiday, Didi became an enemy of her life
 ye ghatana samaaj ke saamne aaine kii tarah he, jisamen badalte badrang sachchaaiyon kii hakeekat najar aa rahi he
 The incident once again reminded him of Pradyuman's murder
 thik usee tarah yahaan bhi bathroom main ek choti class kaa baccha senior chaatr kii sajeesh kaa shikaar bana
 In the same way here too, serious questions were raised about the safety of children in school
 bas ek raahat kii khabar yahi rahi ki jakhmi chaatr kii jaan batch gayi or aaropee chaatra kii pahchaan bhi ek din main hi ho gayi
 The child has told the identity of the student to everyone
 vaardaatke baad police kii jaanch or karrwai apni jagah he, lekin skool ke andar aisi ghatnaayen bade sawaal khadey kar rahi hai
 How does the seventh student go to school with a knife? Was there no counseling for older children? Was there no other way to express the grievance and anger of the children? The biggest question is, how can it be relaxed to supervise young children coming to school? If a child has come to school and is not in class, then what is the responsibility of the teacher? Pradyuman murder case and the incident of this big school in Lucknow are in the news
 ye ghatnaayen bade skulon kii he, lekin ye sawaal samaaj or shikshan sansthaaon ke saamne he
 a peculiar situation arose in the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly when Parliamentary Affairs Minister Azam Khan expressed his inability to answer a member's question because of his staff fault

" hamaare aphis ne is brifing ke note file main rakhe hi nahin
 "significantly, Khan is known for his scathing and often controversial statements towards bureaucracy
" uttar pradesh ke kasganj main rashtriya str ke khilaadi ko chalati train se phenke jane kii ghatana par rail rajya mantri manoj sinha ne report maangi he
 Expressing sorrow over the incident, he said that such deaths are tragedy and the death of the national player is even more tragedy
 unhone doshiyon ke khilaaf ection lene kaa bharosa diya he
 Manoj Sinha, placing the responsibility on the state government, said, 'such complaints have been coming
 railway police rajya sarkaar ke adheen he
 We have been writing to the state about this
 'unhone kaha ki ham is bare main logon ko jaagruk bhi karte rahe hai ki tikat check karnaa railway police kaa kaam nahin he
 The player was in the women's coach
 It is worth mentioning that for just 200 rupees in Kasganj, the railway police soldiers threw the national level player from the moving train, killing him on the spot
 khilaadi kii galati bas itani thi ki vah kuch der ke liye mahila coach main aakar baith gaya tha
 National level player of fencing Hoshiar Singh along with his wife Jyoti Singh and mother Shashi, were shaving their 7-month-old son Yuvraj from Mathuraut from Kasganj on a passenger train
 hoshiyaar ne maa or patni ko mahila coach main baitha diya or khud aakar general coach main baith gaye
 Shortly after the train started, the wife called him and informed him about his health
 police waalon par 200 rupee maangane kaa aropasikandra rau stesan par train rukne par jab ve patni or maa ke paas mahila coach main pahunche, to vahaan maujuud railway police ke sipaahiyon ne unhen coach se utarane ke liye kaha
 On this, Hoshiyar described his wife's health as a national player of fencing
 lekin aarope he ki sipaahiyon ne unase mahila coach main baithe rahane ke liye 200 rupee kii maang kii
 At this point the heated debate turned into a rage
 aarope he ki sipaahiyon ne hoshiyaar singh kochalati train se dhakkade diya, jisase unki sikandra rau stesan par hi maut ho gai
 Like every Diwali this time too, e-commerce companies have earned a lot of money
 lekin bhartiya i-commers company flipcart kaa daawa he ki isane festive sijan ke dauraan amejon india ke mukaable 70 se 80 fisadi zyada saamaan kii bikri kii
 Obviously, more sales means more earnings
 haalanki amejon ne kaha he, 'ham kisi afvaahon par coment nahin karte or naa hi apni kamai ke numbers ke bare main bataate hai'
 Apart from this, the company has also refused to say how much has been earned during the festive season
 kisi i-commers company ne yah saaf nahin kiya ki use kitni kamai hui, lekin mote taur par bataaya he
 Flipkart did a business of around 3,000 crores during the five-day festive sale
 company ke mutabik is paanch din main 15
 5 million items have been sold
 amejon ne kamai ke bare main nahin bataaya he
 However, researchers believe that last year all the three e-commerce companies had done business of 1 billion rupees, or 6,800 crore rupees only during the festive season, then obviously this time it will be more than this
 flipcart or isaki sahyogi website mintra ne 12 ghante main 2
 Has sold 25 million units
 festive cell ke pehle 12 ghante main amejon ne 1
 Claims to have sold 5 million units
 isamen 1 lakh saamaan pehle 30 minute main hi bik gaye
 Snapdeal has claimed that 180 orders were booked every second during the festive season
 cell ke din shaam 54 baje tak 1
 1 million people have shopped here
 yani agar diwali or festive sijan ke dauraan bhi sthiti waisi hi rahi jaisi pehle thi
 No major reversal was observed
 pehle paaydaan par flicart, duusare par amejon india or tisare nabar par rahi snapdil
