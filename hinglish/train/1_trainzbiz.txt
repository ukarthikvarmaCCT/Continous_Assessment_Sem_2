 Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan claimed during the foundation stone of Kartarpur Corridor on Wednesday that both India and Pakistan are nuclear armed countries
 imran ne kaha- isliye donon deshon ke bich kisi tarah ke yuddh ke bare main sochna morrkhtaa se bharaa kaa kaam he
 Through this statement, Imran Khan argued that since both countries are armed with nuclear weapons, both countries are equal in strategic power and in the event of war both countries are bound to be destroyed
 haalanki donon deshon kii vaastavik sthiti or maujuuda daur main yuddh ke prachlit siddhanton kii maane to bharat or pakistan ke bich yuddh main agar newclear hathiyaaron kaa istemaal hota he to jahaan bharat ko ek badi kshati pahunchane kii ashanka he vahiin ek baat tay he ki duniya ke nakshe se pakistan puri tarah gaayab ho jayega
 Dr
 Soumyajit Ray, Assistant Professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University School of International Studies and who works in the field of National Security, explains this in detail
 saumyajit re ke mutabik kai dashak se bhartiya sena ke top brass kaa daawa he ki pakistan dwaara newclear hathiyaaron ke saath kisi dussahas ko munhtod jawaab dene kaa samyarth bharat main he
 According to this claim, if Pakistan tries to launch any kind of nuclear attack on India, where India can clear the entire map of the earth from thwarting that attack to counter attack
 nehru indira rahe naakaam, kya PM Modi banaaenge bharat ko P-6?lihaaja, imran khan kaa daawa sachai se koso dur he
 Whether or not nuclear weapons are used in the event of war between India and Pakistan and if the war is fought entirely with conventional weapons, one thing is clear that the outcome of the war will be in India's favor
 darasal imran khan ne apni yah daleel dashakon pehle america or uasasar (maujuuda rus) ke bich sheet yuddh ke dauraan aae yuddh ke siddhant MAD (mutually Assured Destruction) par aadhaarit he
 This theory says that if two countries armed with nuclear weapons use nuclear weapons during war, then life will end in both the countries
 haalanki imran khan ne is siddhant ko or is siddhant par sheet yuddh ke vakt uthe tamaam pakshon ko nazarandaaj kar diya
 In this theory, one side believes that when there exists a big geographical and numerical difference between the two countries, then in case of nuclear war, where big countries in geography and population remain in the treaty of not attacking first and it will be attacked
 In this situation he may have to bear a heavy loss
 jeenyu ke skool of international studies ke ek anya associat professor dow
 Rajan Kumar said that after World War II and during the Cold War, the USSR had a stock of nuclear weapons more than the US
 iske baavjood sheet yuddh ke dashakon ke dauraan apni arthvyavastha, loktantric saamaajik parivesh or bhugol ke chalate america haaavee rahaa
 indo-pak trade will be 6 times, just turn from terrorism to Imran! Professor Rajan Kumar cites another example, saying that at present, both America and Russia are intervening in Syria
 donon hi desh newclear hathiyaaron se las hai iske baavjood paaramparik hathiyaaron ke sahare donon desh syria main apni shakti kaa parichay de rahe hai
 Both, America and Russia, despite being a nuclear armed country, do not consider the possibility of war as foolishness or insanity
 in tathyon ko aadhaar maanate hue sawaal uthta he ki aakhir imran khan ne yuddh kii soch rakhane waalon ko murkh athwa pagal kyon kaha? is sawaal par dow
 Saumyajit Ray says that the biggest drawback of democracy is that through this, one can occupy the top post of a country
 jahaan pakistan banane ke baad se hi pakistan kii sena or pakistan kii loktantric partiyon ke bich varchasv kii ladaai hi he
 Apart from these, fundamentalist institutions in Pakistan have been doing politics of pressure on army and political parties
 haalanki is ladaai main hameshaa pakistan kii sena kaa palada baari rahaa or kattarpanthi shaktiyaan sena ke samarthan main raheen
 But democratic parties have always proved a headache for him
 pakistan ke itihaas main yah pehla mauka he jab pakistani sena ne ek kattarpanthi raajnneetik dal ko na sirf khadaa karne main safalataa pai balki us raajnneetik dal ko satta par asin bhi kar diya
 Therefore, Imran Khan's statement is the face of Pakistani fundamentalism which is working to advance the policies of the army and fundamentalist institutions

 hairaani kii baat to yah he ki chhatarpur kaa rahane vaala sandip dilli ke nami skool se ucch shiksha praapt he or taikwando kaa teacher he
 Doorbell used to call women out of the house
 Police said that this man named Sandeep Chauhan is very vicious and used to target only women living in posh colonies
 amuman vah dorbel bajaata or jaise hi mahila ghar se baahar nikalati, sandip gandi harakatein karke bhaag jaataa
 a similar incident occurred in d block of Vasantkunj on Thursday
 lekin is baar sandip sisitivi camere main kaid ho gaya
 In 20 cases, accused police said that more than 20 cases of Chhadkhani and other crimes are registered against this freak serial molester in various police stations of Delhi itself
 ek maamle main sandip jail kii hawa bhi kha chukaa he
 The girl who jumped from the roof to escape, said that due to Sandeep's antics, women and girls in South West South areas were terrified
 dorbel bajane ke baad mahilaayein darwaja kholane se bhi darati thim
 In one such incident, a girl jumped from the roof to avoid Sandeep
 peedita aaj bhi coma main he
 Mentally unwell, the serial molesterpolis told that Sandeep is married and has two children
 police kaa daawa he ki sandip kii maansik sthiti samaanya nahin he
 Perhaps this is the reason why Sandeep is not getting hurt by doing so vulgar and shameless acts
 police ab sandip kii puri krime history khangaal rahi he or pure maamle kii vistrut jaanch main jute gai he
 Recently Sandeep Police said that accused Sandeep Chauhan had already committed such dirty acts
 vasant kunj thane main uske khilaaf chhedchhad or hatya kii koshish kaa maamla pehle se hi darj he or us maamle main vah14 maheene nyaayik hiraasatamen jail main bitaa chukaa he

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne mahila aarakshan bill ko sansad ke isi satr main paas karne ke liye pradhanmantri modi ko letters likhaa
 On 16 July, he wrote a letter saying that he is with the government to get the bill passed
 duusari taraf modi sarkaar main kaanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne rahul gandhi ko unke patr kaa jawaab patr likhakar diya hai
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that Rahul Gandhi should first support the triple talaq bill
 prasad ne kaha ki sirf mahila aarakshan bill par nahin, donon rashtriya partiyon ko teen talaak, halaala or obisi kamishn bill par bhi saath aana chahie or nai misaal pesh karnaa chahie
 In fact, PM Modi and the Law Minister are well aware that on issues like triple talaq, halala, nikah, the Congress is completely divided inside
 iskaa faaydaa uthaate hue modi sarkaar ne ek baar phir se gend congress ke paale main daal di he
 Responding to Ravi Shankar Prasad's letter, Congress MP Sushmita Dev said that in 2014 the BJP had introduced a women's reservation bill in its manifesto
 ab sarkaar mahila aarakshan bill par apana ruukh saafe kare or sansad ke isi satr main paas kare
 Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad took a jibe at Rahul Gandhi and wrote that we recommend your initiative on the Women's Reservation Bill
 lekin sarkaar ye zarur jaananaa chaahati he ki aap to bill kaa samarthan karenge lekin aapke sahyogi sadan kii kaarywahi ko baadhit to nahin karenge
 The question of Ravi Shankar Prasad is valid
 kyonki 2010 main rajyasabha main mahila aarakshan bill kii copy ko faadane vaale or hangaamaa karne vaale saansad or bill kaa virodh karne vaale dal aaj upie main congress ke sahyogi dal hai
 In 2010, Marshall was used for the first time to expel mps who opposed the bill to pass the Women's Reservation Bill in the Rajya Sabha
 tab bijepi ne rajyasabha main mahila aarakshan bill par upie sarkaar kaa samarthan kar bill ko sadan main paas karaayaa tha
 bjp-congress opposed in the Lok Sabha, then Congress MP Sandeep Dixit and other senior Congress mps opposed the bill in the Lok Sabha
 bijepi se tab loksabhaa main party ke upanetaa gopinath mode or party ke cheef vip ramesh bas ne mahila aarakshan bill kaa virodh khuleam taur par kar party netritv ko musiibat main daal diya tha
 Sensing the trend of politics on the issue of women, Rahul Gandhi once again raised the issue of women's reservation and tried to take political advantage
 lekin modi sarkaar ne mahila aarakshan ko teen talaak, halaala, nikaah jaise muddon se jodakar rahul gandhi kii koshish par palitha laga diya he
 The dispute between detainees and imprisoned guards in the jail of the city Meerut took the form of a bloody struggle on 18 April

 On March 10, 2012, there was fierce firing between the detainees and the inmates of the Basti Mandal Jail

 In response, the police fired 150 rounds, injuring several captives and killing two
 16 march, 2012 ko ramabainagar kii maati jail main kaidi ramshahooran bhadauria kii sandigdh haalat main maut ke baad kaidiyon ne updrav kiya or police ko bandhak bana liya
 The prisoners alleged that Ramshurahan was beaten to death by the jail authorities
 beete kuch dinon ke bheetar hui in raktranjit ghatnaon se uttar pradesh kii jelon ke andruni halaat kii ek badrang tasviir numaayan hoti he
 Jails are not only unsafe but the nexus between criminals and jail workers is strong here

 On March 2, for example, R

 When Kesarwani started vigorously, Dhoni Tiwari and Pawan Pandey, who were locked in a murder case in the same jail, gave the contract to kill him from there itself
 servilans par ye baaten sun lee gayi or hatya ke makasad se aae teen shootaron deepak singh, nand pandeya or ganesh mishra ko police ne daboch liya
 Meanwhile, on April 15, the body of a prisoner Ramdas was found hanging in the toilet in Lucknow District Jail
 jail prashasan ke mutabik yah khudakushi he par ramdaas ke bete anil gautam kaa aarope he ki dabang apradhi uske pita ko jail main pareshaan kar rahe the
 a few days ago, the prisoners had beaten them fiercely
 beete dedh saal main akele isi jail main 23 kaidi dam tod chuke hai
 Why are state jails becoming chaotic? There are two immediate answers
 pehla, jelon kii kul kshamta se zyada kaidiyon kaa hona or doosraa, kaidiyon kii nigaraanee ke liye jail adhikariyon or karmchaariyon kii baari kami
 The Jail Department of the state has a total of 62 prisons including an Adarsh jail, 5 Central Prisons, 51 District Prisons, 3 sub-prisons, 1 Kishore Sadan (bareilly), 1 Nari Bandi Niketan (lucknow)
 naini ko chhod baaki sabhi kendriya karagaar, lakhanu ke adarsh karagaar, yaheen ke nari bandi niketan or bareli ke kishor sadan main keval sajayaftaa bandiyon ko rakhaa jaataa he
 The captives under consideration are also kept in Naini and all other district and sub-prisons
 in jelon kii kshamta kul 47,048 kaidiyon ko rakhane kii he lekin rakhe gaye hai yahaan 77,584 kaidi
 In addition to the special and central jails, some of the newly built prisons are removed and most of the jails have twice the capacity
 ab doosraa pahaluh soobe kii jelon main adhikariyon / karmchaariyon ke kul 10,400 pad hai, jinamein bandirakshakon ke 1,800 se zyada pad khaali hai
 Not only this, 25 posts of jail superintendents are also lying vacant due to the closure of the recruitment process for a long time
 purv police mahanideshak yashpal singh bataate hai ki ''is araajaktaa kii vajah jelon ke nigaraanee tantra kaa lachar hona he
 "an incident on April 11 in the Divisional Jail in Gorakhpur presented another colorless picture of the jails
" yahaan barrack number 8-bi main band kaidi ankit vishwakarma ne apane gale, haath or pairon ko blade se katkar khudakushi karne kii koshish kii
 According to officials, 25-year-old Ankit, who was locked up on charges of attempt to murder, was frustrated at not getting bail
 magar unke paas is baat kaa koi tasallibaksh jawaab nahin tha ki uske paas blade pahunchaa kaise?haalat yah he ki kisi kaidi ke paas agar paisa he to jail ke bheetar bhi vah sari suvidhaayen hasil kar saktaa he
 The relatives of an inmate lodged in the Agra District Jail on charges of attempt to murder tell him that during his visit to them, they get him Rs 2,000-3,000 in addition to food and drink
 bhi dete hai taaki bandirakshak usase zyada kaam na karavaaen
 Superintendent of Azamgarh Mandal Jail A
 ke
 Mishra says, "as soon as the prisoners of influence come, they pressurize the jail administration that the system should be in line with them
" virodh karne par ve updrav karte hai
 Inmates within the prisons also discriminate in food
 rasukhdaar kaidiyon ko hi acha bhojan naseeb hota he
 The Kanpur jail with a capacity of 1,245 has 2,224 prisoners
 yahaan ke jail adheekshak aar
 N
 pandeya kii suniah ''kaidiyon kii kshamta ke anuroop hi bhojan kaa bajet hota he
 Now cooking for more than twice that amount of prisoners is a challenge
 ''in jelon ke aspataal bhi aparaadhiyon or rasukhdaar kaidiyon kii aaramgaah bane hue hai
 There have been many such cases in the past years, in which influential inmates were admitted to the hospital after complaining of chest pain
 jila aspataal main tainaat rahe chikitsak da
 a
 ke
 "there is no such device in the jail hospitals to check the disease," says Verma
 agar bhartee na karne ke kaaran kisi kii maut ho gai to sari jimmedaari jail doctor kii hoti he
 There is also pressure on the jail doctor from overbearing prisoners
 pichley saal meerut jail ke aspataal main tainaat dow
 Harpal was shot and killed outside the prison because he refused to make a medical report according to the mind of two dreaded prisoners
 isiilie koi doctor jail aspataal main nahin janaa chahta
 At present, 32 jail hospitals are running without doctors
 yahi vajah he ki pradesh kii jelon main har saal kareeb 500 kaidi beemaari ke chalate dam tod dete hai
 Unfortunately, even in the conspiracy of criminal acts, the jail personnel are not hesitant to support the mafia
 7 agast, 2007 ko meerut jail ke dipti jailer narendra dvivedi kii hatya isi gathjod kaa namoona thi
 On March 29 this year, after a lengthy court proceeding, the court sentenced the deputy jailer Avinash Chauhan and Rajesh Kumar to life imprisonment at the time of the incident
 mafia mobile ke jariye gatividhiyaan chalaate hai
 These mobile and SIM are purchased under pseudonym
 jelon main mobile ke prayog ko rokane ke liye sarkaar ne do saal pehle jaimar lagane kaa faisla liya tha, jo abhi tak paravaan nahin chadh sakaa he
 The same is true of CCTV cameras
 gauratlab he ki duusare rajyon kii haalat bhi kamobesh aisi hi he
 It is obvious that for this condition, the jail staff's bad attitude with the prisoners is also a reason
 yah ek aisa pahalu he jis par fouran dhyaan dene kii jarurat he, khaskar kaidiyon ke maanavadhikaar par
 Otherwise, the poor condition of these jails can become the cause of any major accident at any time

 kai faisle aise hote hai jo sunne main bahut achche hote hai, lagata he ki haa ye to thik hi he balki badhiya he
 But do those decisions have the same benefits as listening
 bharat main 150 saal se bajet ek april se shuru hota rahaa he
 It is being introduced as a British tradition
 ab sarkaar ek janvari se nayaa vitt varsh bananaa chaahati he or centre ke is faisle ke saath madhya pradesh bhi jud gaya he
 Andhra Pradesh has also agreed
 to ek hode si hone vaali he, isliye zaruri he ki ham is faisle ke bare main bhi vichaar karen
 Is it not good to see this change or is it going to have such revolutionary benefits that even big economists are not going to guess
 notebandi ke samay bhi yahi kaha ki dard abhi kaa he, phayda der se milegaa magar lanbaa milegaa
 Is it correct to follow the financial year according to the English calendar
 1582 main pope gregory ne ek janvari se chalane vaale calendar kii shuruyaat kii thi
 There are many calendars in India as well and we celebrate the new year in different months, cleaning our books
 gujarat main oktober november main jab bhi diwaali hoti he, nayaa varsh manaate hai, isi dauraan log nae bahikhaate rakhte hai or puraane ko samet dete hai
 Bestu says the year
 bengal main nayaa saal poila baisaakh ko shuru hota he jo 13, 14 yaa 15 april ko padataa he
 Traders there buy a new book on this day
 maharashtra main march april main gudi padva manaaya jaataa he
 Baisakhi falls on 13 April in Punjab, on this day, the merchants adopt new bookkeeping
 kamaal yah he ki sarkari vitt varsh kaa paalan karte hue hamaare vyapaariyon ne kabhi bhartiya parampara ko nahin choda
 Rather these days, the tradition of celebrating the New Year on April 1 has intensified
 is din ko ek janvari vaale happy new year ke mukaable lokapriy banya ja rahaa he
 King Vikram laid the foundation for this
 ham ise vikram samvath kehete hai
 The Saka calendar has been recognized in India as a half-way
 iske anusaar shaq 1939 chal rahaa he lekin kai sanghathan vikrami samvath ko prachaarit karne main lage rahete hai
 Currently Vikrami Samvat 2074 is going on
 vikrami samvath march april main padane vaali chait shukla paksh pratipada se shuru hota he
 This year, the date fell on 28 March
 taarikh bhale na tay ho lekin ek april se shuru hone vaala bajet bhartiya panrapara ke kaaphi kareeb he
 Why this date has always been seen through spectacles of British tradition
 hamane ise hi bhartiya kyon nahin mana jo bharat jaise krishi pradhan desh kii saamaajik paramparaon ke bilkul qareeb he
 The new year starts from midnight, while the new year of Pratipada starts from sunrise, starting from the western calendar
 hairaani kii baat he ki bhartiya panraparaaon par jor dene vaali sarkaar gragarian calendar ke hisaab se vitt varsh kyon apana rahi he
 The budget starting in April is also in line with the tradition and farming season
 ise british parampara ke chashme se hi kyon dekha gaya
 But the government may not have made such a big decision according to the traditions, but the economic loss would have been taken into consideration
 tark diya ja rahaa he ki ek april se lekar agle saal 31 march tak ke vitt varsh se utana phayda nahin ho rahaa tha jitna hona chahie
 Do we know exactly how much or how much
 aaj is sandarbh main indian express main shaji vikraman And Harjinder has written an article in Hindustan newspaper
 in donon alag alag lekhakon ke lekh se laga ki is faisle kaa koi khaas phayda nahin he
 It is being said that it is a good and practical decision, but it sounds good to see, it is not going to benefit as much as it is being told
 sapanom or kunthaon ke desh america kaa kendriya vitt varsh ek oktober se shuru hota he
 The fiscal years of US states begin on different dates
 rus or china kaa vitt varsh ek janvari se shuru hota he
 The fiscal year of Brazil, France, Greece is from January 1
 kai desh hai jinka vitt varsh ek janvari se nahin hota he
 There are many countries whose fiscal year starts from July and some from April
 yani puri duniya main ek janvari se vitt varsh shuru hone kaa koi sarvamaanya pattern nahin he
 The fiscal year of Egypt, Bangladesh, Australia and Pakistan starts from July 1
 dakshin africa, hong kong, britain or canada kaa vitt varsh ek april se shuru hota he
 You can say that the financial year of most countries starts from January 1
 april-march, july-june or sintabar-agast bhi vitt varsh ke rup main dekhe jate hai
 One benefit of the financial year that starts from January 1 is that the March loot will end, but do you know if the December loot will start trending? bharat main 1950 ke dashak se hi vitt varsh janvari-disbanr karne kii maang uthati rahi he magar is par koi thos faisla nahin ho sakaa
 Many committees have reported but nothing happened
 modi sarkaar ne shankar aacharya cameti bhi banaai thi

 anuchhed main taarikh kaa zikr to nahin he
 The government is only talking about changing the date

 According to the news published in Business Standard on 7 April 2017, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that we are studying the report of changing the financial year
 duniya kaa vitt varsh apane mulk kii zaruuraton ke anusaar hota he, ham puraani british panrapara kaa anusaran kar rahe hai
 Finance Minister Jaitley Shankar was referring to the Iyer Committee, which has been given the task of studying it
 yani 7 april tak to nae vitt varsh ke bare main centre ne faisla nahin kiya tha
 a meeting of the Governing Council of NITI Aayog took place in Delhi on 23 April Sunday
 is baithak main pradhanmantri modi ne kisaanon ke hit ko dhyaan main rakhte hue nayaa vitt varsh apnaane par jor diya tha
 The media report does not suggest that the government has yet decided about the january-december fiscal year
 to aap swaabhaavik he ki jigyaasa hogi ki centre se pehle madhya pradesh ne kaise faisla kar liya
 Has Madhya Pradesh also decided on the basis of any committee report
 centre sarkaar chaahati zarur he ki april-march kii jagah janvari-disambar se vitt varsh shuru ho lekin uske faisle se pehle madhya pradesh kaa yah faisla kaaphi rochak or utsahvardhak lagata he
 Whenever Diwali happens in Gujarat in october-november, we celebrate the new year, during which people keep new books and assimilate the old

 Gudi Padwa is celebrated in march-april in Maharashtra
 punjab main 13 april ko baisakhi padati he, is din vahaan ke vyapaaree nayaa bahikhaata apanaate hai
 The amazing thing is that by following the government fiscal year, our traders never left the Indian tradition

 This day is being popularized as compared to Happy New Year on January 1
 raja vikram ne isaki buniyaad daali thi
 We call it Vikram Samvat
 aadhakirik rup main bharat main shaq calendar ko manyata di gai he
 According to this, suspicion is going on in 1939 but many organizations are busy propagating the Vikram Samvat
 is vakt vikrami samvath 2074 chal rahaa he
 Vikram Samvat March begins with Chait Shukla Paksha Pratipada falling in April
 is saal yah tithi 28 march ko padi thi
 The date may not be fixed but the budget starting from April 1 is very close to the Indian tradition
 is taarikh ko hameshaa british parampara ke chashme se hi kyon dekha jaataa rahaa he
 Why didn't we consider it Indian which is very close to the social traditions of an agricultural country like India
 pashchimi calendar se shuru hone vaala nayaa saal aadhi raat se aata he, jabaki pratipada kaa nayaa saal suryoday se shuru hota he
 Surprisingly, why the government emphasizing the Indian traditions is adopting the fiscal year according to the Gregorian calendar
 april se shuru hone vaala bajet parampara or kheti ke sizan ke anukool bhi he
 Why it was seen through the spectacles of British tradition itself
 magar sarkaar ne itnaa bada faisla paramparaon ke hisaab to nahin kiya hoga balki aarthik napha nuksaan kaa hi khyaal rakhaa gaya hoga
 It is being argued that the financial year from April 1 to March 31 of the next year was not benefiting as much as it should have

 The fiscal year of South Africa, Hong Kong, Britain and Canada starts from April 1

 In Karnataka, the magic of BS Yeddyurappa has once again raised the heads of people

 The seats where elections were held, these seats are considered to be strong bastions of Congress and JDS
 in siton par bijepi camel khilaane main kaamyaab rahi he
 The reasons behind this were many reasons, including BJP playing bets on rebels and scattering of opposition, due to which BS Yeddyurappa has won a tremendous victory

 However, the Supreme Court in November allowed these disqualified mlas to contest elections

 Kumaraswamy not seen active In the by-election, former Chief Minister Kumaraswamy was not as active as he was seen in the assembly elections
 yahi kaaran rahaa ki jedies kaa prachaar abhiyaan bhi pichad gaya or 5 disambar ko 12 siton par chunaav ladane vaali jedies ek bhi seat nahin jeet pai
 The JDS had contested a dozen seats on its own against the ruling BJP and Congress on its own, parting from its former ally Congress

 Apart from this, the case of defamation and sedition filed by Bengaluru Police on some leaders including Siddaramaiah, g Parameshwara, DK Shivkumar, Dinesh Gundu Rao left a negative impact among voters
 kahin na kahin congress ko iskaa khamiyaja jarur bhugatna padaa he
 The ruling party (BJP) is elevated by winning 12 seats in the ruling 15 in the by-election

 pura, mahalakshmi leout, yashavantpur or krishnarajpet siton par jeet darj kii he
 The ruling BJP needed only seven seats to reach the 112-seat figure needed for a majority in the 222-member assembly, but it won 12 seats and with it now the four-month-old BJP government completed its term by May 2023

 Come, let me teach you Anda Funda, this is not a dear little fellow
 or is andey kaa funda agsplor jaakar pataa chalata he ki anda asal main maamuli nahin he
 What kind of dishes can you think of eggs, Boyle, Half Fry, Omelette, Egg Curry, Egg Paratha and Egg Biryani et cetera
 lekin agsplor main jaakar andey ke kareeb 80 tarah ke vyanjan milte hai or li se hatakar aise vyanjan jinke bare main aap soch bhi nahin sakate ki ye andey se bane hai
 Apart from non-vegetarian and vegetarian in the world, a new class has been created
 or aise logon ke liye agsplor jananath he
 Up to three eggs are used in some dishes, four in some and up to seven in some
 isaki ek khaas dish he rajasthani mehfil jo dekhne or khaane main daal kii tarah lagati he jabaki isamen daal kaa ek dana bhi nahin he
 Another dish is American Rabri which is very sweet rabdi
 tikhaa or chatakdaar pasand karne waalon ke liye tikkonia fray or cheez goti jaisi dishes hai
 Currently, the outlets of Eggsplore have a variety of items from First Course, Soup, Wrap & Roll, Omelette, Fry, Rice, Brunch Time, Eggsplore Special, Pizza, Pasta & Salad, Tawa Mahfil, Desi Tadka and Combo Meals
 kai dishes main uttar bharat ke bhi flavor hai
 Because, the people of North love eggs very much
 iske alaava egg 65, russian fray, carabian fray, butter egg mughlai, boil tikka kaa sugandh na sirf munh main pani bhar detaa he balki khaane ke liye bhi majaboor karata he
 The Eggsplore chain Fastfood Outlet is started by three young friends, Krishna Rander, 28, Rakesh Rathi, 43, and Chandresh Rathi, 29
 ye teenon maheshwari parivaar se naata rakhte hai or inke ghar main andey kii gandh bhi pasand nahin kii jaati he
 Seeing people's love for eggs, i decided to open Eggsplore
 chandresh kehete hai, jo ek bijnesaman bhi hai
 Rakesh, a chartered accountant by profession, said, 'I had come to cut the lace at the inauguration of one of my friends' outlets
 or andey ke itane rup ko dekhakar main is bijness main partner ban gaya
 Krishna is the builder
 magar andey ke prati logon ke pyaar ne unhen is bijness se judane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 Says Rakesh, 'by the end of this year, 70 outlets of Eggsplore will be opened in Mumbai to allow egg lovers to eat Variety dishes in any area of mumbai
 rajasthan ke jodhpur or jaipur main bhi agsplor ke outlet khulenge
 Within three months of this heart-rending outlet serving egg yolks, the fourth outlet has opened in Oshiwara in Andheri, Mumbai
 isse pehle boriwali, malad or mira road main bhi iske outlet khole gaye
 It is the first fastfood outlet in the country where egg dishes are prepared on an induction machine
 yah iko-friendli he
 According to Rakesh, the inspiration to open Eggsplore was taken from an outlet in Surat where egg was found among the people
 lekin vahaan par logon ko 30-35 kism ke hi vyanjan milte hai
 Eggsplore currently has around 80 varieties of dishes and will be closer to 250 in the coming months
 agsplor kaa ap bhi taiyaar ho rahaa he jiske baad logon ko ghar baithe manapsand egg dishes khaane ko milenge
 Rakesh says, 'egg is a hygenic and protein food
 iske tarah-tarah ke vyanjan swasthya ke liye laabhadaayak hai
 To increase the type of egg dish, tours are made in India and abroad and then a new dish is prepared by adding flavor to it
 ek dish ko banane main kaaphi mashakt kerani padati he
 Seven out of ten failures occur
 in vyanjanon ke liye masaale bhi khud taiyaar kiye jate hai jisase logon ko swaadisht vyanjan milte hai
 We train the trend chefs to be the chefs of Eggsplore
 induction mashin bhi ham khud banaate hai jis par laagat kareeb saadhe teen lakh rupe he

 com / yuwxfpgn8d The historic journey of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, which has been going on for 20 years at the Maratha temple in Mumbai, ended on Thursday
 maratha mandir main record tod 1009 hafton kaa lanbaa safar tay karne ke baad ab yahaan didlje nahin dikhaai jaaegi
 The film was last shown in the Maratha temple at 9
15 am on Thursday
 bhartiya itihaas main kisi bhi theatre main sabase lambii chalane vaali ye iklauti film he
 Maratha Temple Managing Director Manoj Desai claims that Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is the only film in cinema history that has overtaken blockbuster films like mughal-e-azam and Sholay
 1995 main release ke baad se lagaataar maratha mandir main chal rahi didlje ne pichley saal disambar main apane 1000 hafte puure kiye the jiske jashn main raaj or simran yani shahrukh or kaajol donon shaamil hue the
 For 500 weeks, the film grossed 200 crores at the box office
 1000 hafton tak aate aate aankadon main chand karod hi jude the, par public kii demand or yashraj binar kii 1000 hafte puure karne kii chahat par maratha mandir se film nahin hataai ja rahi thi
 But now the film has been removed from the theater with the mutual consent of the theater and Yash Raj
 ab tak kii sabase kaamyaab filmon main ek dilavaale dulhaniya le jaaenge banane ke peeche chuphi he sitaron kii kadi mehnat or didlje se diarection main debyue karne vaale yash chopra ke bete aditya chopra kii jabardast lagan
 a team of over 400 people laid the foundation for DDLJ
 ab mumbai ke maratha mandir ko intazaar he DDLJ ko takkar dene vaali kisi duusari film kaa
 The question is, are they in the current Bollywood films? kolkata main shanivaar ko trinmul congress kii netaa or pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee kaa 'shakti pradarshan' puri tarah se safal rahaa he
 About 20 leaders, including 20 former leaders including several former Prime Ministers, many Chief Ministers and former Chief Ministers
 is raily main bijepi netaa or vaajapeyi sarkaar main mantri raheyashwanth sinha or arun shouri ne bhi manch se modi sarkaar ko lalakaara to patna sahib se bijepi saansad shatrughna sinha ne bhi apane bhaashan main kaha, 'chaukeedaar chor he'
 Sinha also described Tejashwi Yadav as the future of Bihar
 mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi bahut jald hi un par karrwai kar sakati he
 It was Mamata Banerjee who was leading the stage and Mallikarjun Kharge from Congress, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Satish Chandra Mishra from BSP, Akhilesh Yadav from SP, Farrukh Abdullah from National Conference and his son Omar Abdullah, Sharad Yadav, TDP leader and Andhra Pradesh CM Chandra Babu Naidu, Karnataka CM Kumaraswamy, former Prime Ministers HD Deve Gowda, Hemant Soren, DMK to Stalin, Ama Man Park Shri Arvind Kejriwal and RJD leader stunning Yadav, Hardik Patel from Gujarat and Jayant from Jignesh Mewani, RLD Chowdhury were also present
 manch ke 20 netaaon ke saath hi maidan par bheed bhi hairaan kar dene vaali thi
 Mamta Banerjee, who is advocating for the Third Front, has shown her strength in Kolkata and many leaders have praised her
 arun shouri ne unhen 'sherni' kaha or kaha ki yahaan aae sabhi partiyon ko apane vyaktigat swaarth or siton kii sankhya bhulaakar bijepi ko hataane ke liye ekajute ho janaa chahie
 Where before the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress is trying to strengthen the UPA, on the other hand Mamta Banerjee has also shown her strength with whom the big leaders are with
 manch par kai netaaon ne yah bhi kaha he ki baad main tay kar lenge ki koun pradhanmantri hoga
 At the same time, Congress has already declared Rahul Gandhi as the PM candidate
 uttar pradesh main sapa or bispi ne apane gathbandhan se pehle hi congress ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya he
 It is also worth noting that neither Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav and Arvind Kejriwal had left the Bharat Bandh called on Congress for inflation and the rally at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan, except the Left parties and some parties
 manch par bhi itane netaa ikattha nahin hue the
 But leaders from South India also appeared on the stage
 vahiin khabar yah he ki uttar pradesh main sapa or bispi bhi milakar aisi hi raily kii yojana bana rahe hai
 Overall, the picture is clear that the opposition party is not in the mood to give that much attention to Rahul Gandhi
 vahiin agar siton kaa samjhauta bhi hua to congress ko jhatka lag saktaa he
 On the other hand, if the Congress fights elections with these parties, it will be easy to agree on Rahul Gandhi's name for the prime ministerial candidate, there is also a cloud of doubt because it is clearly told from Mamata Banerjee's platform that Who will be the Prime Minister will decide later

 america kii aare se nirantar dabaav badhaaye jane ke maddenjar pakistani sarkaar desh ke uttari wajiristaan main aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf simit karrwai aarambh kar sakati he
 The target of this possible action of Pakistan will be mainly the Haqqani network
 sthaneey samachar patr ‘don’ ne aadhikarik sutron ke hawaale se daawa kiya he ki is simit karrwai main alqaida, taliban or videshi aatankwaadiyon ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya jaayegaa
 Nothing has been said about when this action will begin
 adhikariyon ne kaha ki sainya karrwai mukhya rup se hakkaani network ko nishaanaa banaakar kii jaayegi
 Meanwhile, the newspaper 'the News' reported that the US has given an ultimatum to Pakistan to start a military operation in North Waziristan till July
 pakistani surakshabalon se kaha gaya he ki ve al jawahiri, mullah umr, eliyas kashmiri, sirajuddin hakkaani or atiya abdur rahamaan ko july tak kii samaysima ke bheetar yaa to ekatarfa karrwai kar pakaden yaa phir america ke saath milakar sanyukt sainya karrwai karen
 The month of July is the month when NATO and allied forces begin withdrawing from neighboring Afghanistan
 ‘da news’ ne agyaat aadhikarik sutron ke hawaale se kaha ki america kii maang ne pakistan ke sainya or asainya tabakon main halchal machaa di he
 Pakistan's security forces have been reluctant to take military action in North Waziristan, despite the tremendous pressure from the US
 report main kaha gaya he ki uttari wajiristaan sthit hakkaani network ke aatankwaadi ‘pakistan ke liye khatra nahin rahe hai’ or yah ‘afgaan taliban tathaa pakistani khufia agenciyon ke bich sampark ke vyapak madhyam ke rup main’ kaam karata rahaa he
 Another reason for the reluctance of the Pakistani army to take action in North Waziristan is that there are 'some very important pro-government' terrorist groups, including Mulla Nazir and Hafiz Gul Bahadar-led organizations
 report main kaha gaya he ki in samoohon ne ‘wajiron sahit sarkaar virdohi kabaili ladaakon ke khilaaf ladaai main pakistani surakshabalon kii madad kii he
 'for the past few years, militants of the former tehrik-e-taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud and his successor Hakimullah Mehsud have waged a war against Pakistani security forces along with Mehsud clan lashkar-e-jhangvi and some other ethnic groups
 ’report main kaha gaya he ki do may ko pakistan ke abtabad main america hamale main osama bin laden ke maare jane ke baad afghanistan se sainik hataane kaa america faisla or bhi drudh ho gaya he
 American Vice President Joe
 biden jaise raajnneetik salaahkaaron ne raashtrapati baraak obama ko salaah di he ki yadi vah america arthvyavastha ko bure prabhaav se bachaana chaahate hai to 2009 main kii gai sainik hataane kii ghoshnaa se peeche nahin haten
 It claimed that the deadline for military operations in North Waziristan and the increasing pressure on Pakistan would resolve many objectives before the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan
 pakistani or america surakshabalon dwaara kuch sarvaadhik vaanchit aatankwaadiyon ko maar giraane yaa unhen pakad liye jane se america logon kaa manobal badhegaa
 Such a move would also close the mouths of critics who might say that the 'exhausted country and defeated army decided to withdraw troops
 ’ report main kaha gaya he ki afgaan taliban ko disha nirdesh de rahe pakistan sthit hakkaani network or alqaida tathaa taliban ke commander yah daawa nahin kar paaenge ki videshi sainikon kaa hatana unki jeet he

 inputah bhashaa In Chhattisgarh, the word Dalit has been banned in government and non-government records
 sarkaar ne baqayada aadesh jari kar dalit ke sthaan par jati kaa ullekh karne kaa nirdesh diya he
 The order, issued just before the assembly elections in the state, was termed by Congress as part of the social engineering of Chief Minister Raman Singh
 party kaa daawa he ki yah circular nahin balki ek shigupha he
 Government issued circular a few months before the assembly elections in Chhattisgarh, the state government has issued this circular and tried to help a large community of scheduled castes
 centre sarkaar ke disha-nirdeshon kaa hawala dete hue rajya sarkaar ne sabhi sarkari dastavejon main dalit shabd ke istemaal par roak laga di he
 The General Administration Department of Chhattisgarh Government, while directing all the government departments of the state, has said that this word is not in the constitution
 isliye iskaa prayog naa ho
 In the era of joint Madhya Pradesh before the formation of the state, the then government issued a notification on February 10, 1982 and banned the word Harijan
 is shabd ke istemaal par sajaa kaa bhi praavdhaan kiya gaya, lekin dalit shabd ke prayog par kitni sajaa kaa praavdhaan hoga yah spasht nahin he
 It is said that after the instructions of Chief Minister Raman Singh, the General Administration Department has issued this circular and gave directions to all departments
 iske ulanghan par sajaa ke praavdhaan par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 According to Chief Minister Raman Singh, Congress never gave the respect to Dalits
 wo bijepi ke satta main aane ke baad unki party de rahi he
 He said that this society is hurt by the word Dalit
 isliye is par pabandi lagaai gai he
 This will further increase the respect of the Scheduled Castes

 rajya main anusuchit jati varg ke liye kul 90 main se 10 siten arakshit hai
 Of this, BJP holds 9 seats
 jabaki ek seat par congress kaa kabja he
 Therefore, by banning the use of the word Dalit, the BJP government of the state is making every effort to keep this large section in its camp
 rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ne anusuchit jati varg ke liye kai kalyankari yojanaayen barason se jari he, lekin yah varg mahasoos karata tha ki sarkari dastavejon main dalit shabd unke sammaan kaa hanan karata tha
 So throw this word out and throw it out
 siem raman sinhane apane tisare kaarykaal ke antim daur main dalit shabd ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaakar is varg ko bijepi ke bheetar banaae rakhane ke liye fouran aadesh jari kar diya
 The Congress said, this votebank politics, the decision of the BJP government is not acceptable to the Congress
 uskaa maananaa he ki raman singh kii yah shigufe vaali ek chaal he, jo vot bank ke khatir chali gai he
 According to the party, the justification for this decision, taken a few days before the assembly elections, is only to give vent to vote bank politics

 Member of Bihar Legislative Council and JD (U) State Spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said that Modi is still struggling with his party and a lot of internal crises in Gujarat, so in this case he is not expressing his heart, but somewhere But eyes are targeting somewhere
 niraj kaa kahana tha ki ki aisi baat kehane se purv modi ko dhyaan rakhana chahie ki yahaan unki party bhi sarkaar main shaamil he
 Neeraj said that Gujarat inherited the infrastructure and most of Bihar was affected by floods and drought, but despite that due to the efficiency of the Chief Minister of the state, Nitish Kumar, great achievements were made here
 niraj ne kaha ki desh ke aarthik aankadon ne sabit kar diya he ki bihar jaisaa bimaaru rajya vikaas dar or prati vyakti aay ke maamle main gujarat se bahut aage he or bihar kaa jo gauravpurn itihaas purv main rahaa he, yah usee disha main badhata hua kadam he
 According to the JD (U) state spokesperson, the growth rate achieved in Bihar despite these adverse conditions is the result of our actions in the field of infrastructure
 vittiya prabandhan kii badaulat ham ise vikaas ke maarg par aage lekar chal rahe hai
 He said that caste bonds have been broken in Bihar
 yahaan 115 narsanhaar hue the, jo ab band hue hai tathaa yahaan saamaajik samarasata evam sampradayik sauhaard kaa maahaul bana he, vah kuch logon ko raas nahin aa rahaa he
 Neeraj said that Nitish often says that social harmony and communal harmony are our capital and the human labor of 10 crore people of Bihar, due to which Bihar is developing and so is Modi's party in power in Bihar

 Following this decision, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi attacked the Maharashtra government and asked Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis if he would provide reservation to Muslims? Owaisi said that if the High Court has made it clear that Muslims are backward, why did you (fadnavis) not implement the reservation again? Owaisi said that they can do it if they want but will not because these people are interested in Shah Bano
 @dev_fadnavislet Muslim reservations slide while he moved from pillar to post for # marathareservation
 If HC was clear that Muslims are backward, then why did they you not reintroduce reservations? They can still do it, but they won't
 All they’re interested in is Shah Bano— Asaduddin Owaisi (@asadowaisi)june 27, 2019isse pehle ek or twit main maratha aarakshan ke bare main ovaisi ne kaha ki 'hamen yaad rakhana chahie ki bombai hoicourt ne pukhta sabooton ke aadhaar par ise pehle hi thukraa diya tha, jabaki usee vakt muslim pichhadi jati ke liye shiksha main aarakshan ko maan liya tha taaki is samudaay ko mukhyadhara main laayaa ja sake
 'on # marathareservationwe should always remember that the Bombay High Court had previously struck them down for lack of empirical evidence; However, at the same time it's upheld reservation in education for Muslim backward castes in order to bring the community into the mainstream — Asaduddin Owaisi (@asadowaisi) June 27, 2019
 The Bombay High Court has proposed 16 percent Maratha reservation to be reduced to education
 While doing 12 per cent and 13 per cent for jobs, it was found that the higher quota was 'not fair'
 guuruuvaar kaa faisla rajya sarkaar ke november 2018 ke faisle ko chunauti dene vaali yachikaaon par aayaa, jisamen esaibisi shrenee ke tahat maratha samudaay ko 16 pratishat aarakshan diya gaya tha

 haalanki, unke mantri sudhir mungantiwar ne kaha ki rajya adaalat se 16 pratishat kota par punarvichaar karne kaa anurodh karegaa
 One of the petitioners, Vijayalakshmi Khopade, said that the court had passed the nine-member M

 is siyaasi ran main kai maujuuda mantri bhi ek baar phir apni kismat aajamaa rahe hai
 But there is such a coincidence in Rajasthan, due to which the eyes of the current sports minister are also kept on the day of election results
 rajasthan main gajendra singh khinvsar rajya ke khel or van mantri hai, jo lohawat se vidhayak hai
 Actually, in the politics of Rajasthan, it is believed that whoever is the current Sports Minister, no matter how veteran he is, he has to face defeat
 aisa pichley kai saalon se ho rahaa he or har baar khel mantri chunavi maidan main haar hi jaataa he
 During the tenure of the Vasundhara government in the year 2003, when he made two sports ministers, both of them were destined to lose
 jaanate hai aisa kab se ho rahaa he or koun-koun se netaa iske gavaah bane hai

 This myth proved to be true with this defeat

 Yunus Khan arrived for the first time in 2003 and was made the Sports Minister in the Vasundhara government
 haalanki ve puure paanch saal khel mantri nahin the or unke baad pratap singh singhvi ko khel mantri banaaya gaya
 He may have been Sports Minister for a few months, but in 2008 he had to face defeat
 pratap singh singhvivasundhara raaje 2003 kii sarkaar main unuus khan ke baad pratap singh singhvi ko khel mantri banaaya gaya
 Singhvi, one of the veteran leaders of the state, also lost the 'black magic' of the Sports Minister and he too suffered defeat in 2008

 yogi ne yah bhi kah diya ki jin aatankwaadiyon ko congress biryani khilaati thi ham unhen goli khilaa rahe hai
 Not only this, Yogi Adityanath also referred to the statement of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, accusing the Congress of discrimination in which he said that the first right over the resources of the country is that of Muslims
 yogi ne is bayaan kaa zikr karte hue poocha ki agar sansadhano par musalamaanon kaa adhikaar he to desh kaa hindu kahaan jayega?congress kii yogi ko tonk main sabha karne kii chunautirajasthan main congress ne kul 15 muslim ummidavaaron ko tikat die hai, inamen se 8 ummidavaar wo hai jinhen 2013 main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha

 The demonetisation caused by the queue of banks is now affecting the farmers, who are called Prithviputra
 narela mandi main dhan kii upaj lekar aane vaale kisaanon ko vyapaaree nagad bhugtan nahin de rahe hai, jiske kaaran wo fasal ke parivahan par hone vaala kharchaa bhi nahin nikaal paa rahe
 On the other hand, due to lack of money for seeds and fertilizers, the crisis of the next crop has arisen in front of them
 in dinon dilli kii narela mandi main desh ke alag-alag hisson se kisaan unki dhan kii fasal lekar pahunch rahe hai, lekincash kii kamine unke saamne kai tarah kii pareshaaniyaan khadi kar di hai
 Farmer Harish Yadav from Sirsaganj in UP reached Narela Mandi with the produce of paddy, but the demonetisation had such an effect that now there is a problem of going back home
 fasal kaa daam cash main nahin mila, jisase ab jis trek main upaj lekar aae ab uske dijal or driver kii pement nahin ho paa rahi
 Traders are willing to pay in check instead of cash, but due to the bank closing for the next three days, the question is how to redeem the check
 kuch aisi hi pareshaani sonipat se aae jagavir singh or mathura se aae nihaal singh naam ke kisaanon kii bhi he
 These have also brought crops, but now there is a problem that cash is not available
 aise main inke saamne sankat is baat kaa he ki genhu kii fasal ke liye jo beej or khaad laana he uske liye paisa kahaan se aaenge
 Apart from the problems of the farmers, the traders have their own problems
 pareshaani ye ki khud unke paas cash nahin he, isliye wo check se bhugtan kar rahe hai lekin wo khud maan rahe hai ki check se kisaan puure paise nahin nikaal paa rahaa
 Overall, the crisis in Narela Mandi poses a problem for the three farmers, laborers and traders, but the big question is how long the situation will remain as demonetisation has passed for a month and the situation is not the same as the government had thought
