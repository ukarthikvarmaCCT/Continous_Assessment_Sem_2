 You must have heard the Chief Minister of Gujarat Narendra Modi making big claims for the development of Gujarat
 lekin gujarat kaa ek aisa cheharaa bhi he jo modi ke daavon ko khokhla sabit karata he
 Perhaps Modi does not know that Gujarat or does not want to see it deliberately
 modi ke anusaar gujarat kaa vikaas model desh main bhi lagu hona chahie
 If the winds of development are blowing in Gujarat, then why are the farmers of Gujarat suicidal? Often Modi rejects the claims of pride in Gujarat, then why 112 farmers committed suicide in 4 years? Modi calls himself Vikas Purush, why does he not see the helplessness of the farmers of his own state? You must have heard big claims of development in Gujarat
 gujarat main kisaanon kii khushhaali kii badi-badi baaten bhi modi karte hai
 You may have heard Modi saying that Gujarat is shining, but a part of that glow is such a depth about which you too will be shocked
 sookhe or karj ke maare gujarat ke kisaan aatmahatya karne ko majaboor hai
 But it seems Modi does not care
 ek kisaan kii dukh bhari dastaan padhie, lekin kai anya kisaanon ke halaat isse juda nahin hai
 'my crop is ruined because of no rain
 bank or duusare karj bhi bad gayi the
 We have not received any kind of help from the government
 mere parivaar main 8 log hai, unka guzaara bhi ab main nahin chalaa saktaa
 The bankers are pressurizing me to repay the loan
 2005 main hamane jo fasal suraksha beemaa liya tha uskaa paisa sarkaar ne ajtak hamen nahin diya he
 Despite this, insurance money is taken continuously from the farmers
 ’khud ko gujarat ke vikaas ke vidhaataa kii tarah pesh karne vaale narendra modi ke naam ye wo chitthee he jisamen unki badshahath se niraashaa ke alaava kuch nahin he
 Anirudh Singh Jadeja of Jamnagar had hoped for a miracle with this letter, but there was a prelude to death in those nomads
 jadeja ne jaan de di
 This news of the life of a debt-ridden Gujarati farmer is seven months old
 is bich jamnagar main dwarka ke esadm ne police ko aadesh bhi diya ki wo aniruddh singh kii chitthee ko daaing diclaration ke taur par darj kare or aage kii karrwai karen
 But for seven months, Anirudh Singh Jadeja's family has been waiting
 na fasal suraksha beemaa kaa paisa mila or naa hi aatmahatya kaa ghoshit muaavja mila
 How strange that farmers are committing suicide on the one hand, on the other hand, Narendra Modi is raising sympathy slogans from farmers
 kisaanon ke liye modi mela lagaate hai or daawey karte hai ki unki sarkaar kursi ke liye nahin balki krishi ke liye he
 Combining the compulsion of suicide of Anirudh Singh with these claims of Narendra Modi, one can see a different kind of Gujarat
 laachaar gujarat, tarasata or tadapata gujarat
 Has Narendra Modi never really seen his Gujarat? Anirudh Singh's letter written before the suicide is asking, if not seen, why not see it? In the last four years, 112 farmers of Gujarat committed suicide
 sabase zyada prabhavit saurashtra or kuccha ilaaka he
 But Modi claims that the agricultural growth rate in Gujarat is in two points
 ab modi ke is daawey par sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 These days Narendra Modi is talking a lot about the well being of the farmers by organizing agriculture fair in Gujarat
 duniya ko aadhunik or organic krishi kaa paath padhaate hai narendra modi
 And Narendra Modi also claims to be in double digits of agricultural growth rate in Gujarat
 lekin tasviir kaa doosraa pahalu bhi he
 That aspect which either Modi does not know or does not want to see intentionally
 artiai kii madad se mili aankadon ke mutabik 1 janvari 2008 se lekar 19 agast 2012 tak gujarat ke 112 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 You will be surprised to know that only in 2012, 65 farmers have committed suicide
 sookhe ke chalate june 2012 se lekar oktober 2012 tak yani paanch maheenon main 42 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii
 Experts believe that Modi's policies are responsible only for the suicides of farmers
 ahmedabad ke saamaajik kaaryakarta bharatsingh jhaalaa kehete hai, main maanata hum ki sarkaar kii jo niti he uski vajah se kisaanon ko aatmahatya kerani pad rahi he, sarkaar ne pichley saal gujarat main sookhaa padane baavjood ab tak ek bhi kisaan ko fasal suraksha beemaa nahin diya he
 Even though Gujarat is being talked about, claims are being made of double-digit agricultural growth, but experts believe that all statistics are in play
 sawaal khadey kiye ja rahe hai ki achaanak 1
 72% to 10
 59 % kaise ho gai krishi vikaas dar? vikaas dar kii gananaa ke liye 1998-99 kii jagah 2000-2001 kyon kiya gaya base year?sawaal isliye lajimi he kyonki modi jinke bare main bade-bade daawey kar rahe hai, un kisaanon ko lag rahaa he ki sarkaar naa to unke liye kuch kar rahi he or naa hi unki baaten sun rahi he
 Now the question is, why Modi, who talks big, shows Gujarat to the world, does not see this face of Gujarat

 Later in this regard the defense ministry spokesperson said that it should be seen as a private opinion rather than the official position of the defense minister
 ullekhneey he ki raksha mantri ne ek book relies kaarykram ke dauraan yah baat kahi
 Actually, in principle, India has been talking about not using nuclear weapons first in the event of conflict
 pakistan ne is tarah kii koi baat nahin kahi he
 Speaking on India's nuclear policy, the Defense Minister said, "if there is an existing written strategy or you have taken such a stand, then i think you are really moving away from your capabilities in this matter
" 
 
 desh main bahut saare log pehle parmaanu hathiyaar istemaal nahin karne sambandhi niti ke bare main kehete hai lekin mujhe is maamle main apane aapako kyon baandhna chahie? main to kahata hum ki ham ek jimmedaar parmaanu shakti sampann raashtra hai or main iskaa gaiyr jimmedaarana dhang se istemaal nahin karunga
 This is my thought '' At the same time, however, he insisted, "his statement should not be seen in the context that the government has changed its nuclear policy
" unhone kaha ho saktaa he ki kuch (channel) kal yah flash chalaane lagen ki parmaanu niti badal gai lekin aisa nahin he
 '' gauratlab he ki 1998 main kai parmaanu pareekshan karne ke baad bharat ne maujuuda parmaanu niti ko apanaaya
 In response, Pakistan also conducted several nuclear tests within a few weeks of that
 2014 ke chunavi ghoshnaptr main is sambandh main kaha tha ki maujuuda samay kii chunautiyon ke maddenjar is niti kii samiksha karegi or ise apadet karegi
 The comments parrikar ne saath hi kaha, ''pehle har chaar-paanch din main unako padosi desh ke raksha mantri dhamkee dete the ki yadi unako dhamkaaya jayega to vah tactical parmaanu hathiyaaron kaa istemaal karenge lekin jis din sargical strike hui, uske baad se phir koi dhamkee nahin ai
 '' ullekhneey he ki kashmir ke uri main ek army camp main pakistani aatankiyon ke hamale main 19 jawan shahid hue the
 After that India crossed the loc and did a surgical strike
 pakista ne is tarah kii ghatana hone se inkaar kar diya
 It is notable that the Defense Minister said this during a book release program
 darasal saidhantik rup se bharat sangharsh hone kii sthiti main pehle parmaanu hathiyaaron ke istemaal nahin karne kii baat kahata rahaa he
 Pakistan has not said any such thing
 bharat kii parmaanu niti par bolte hue raksha mantri ne kaha, ''yadi koi maujuuda likhit ranneeti he yaa aapane is tarah kaa koi stand le rakhaa he to main samajhataa hum ki aap vastav main is maamle main apni kshamtaaon se dur hat rahe hai
 
 
 Many people in the country first talk about the policy of not using nuclear weapons, but why should i tie myself up in this matter? i say that we are a responsible nuclear power state and i will not use it irresponsibly
 ye meri soch he
 '' haalanki iske saath hi unhone jor dekar kaha, ''unke is bayaan ko is sandarbh main nahin dekhnaa chahie ki sarkaar ne apni parmaanu niti badal di he

 '' Significantly, after carrying out several nuclear tests in 1998, India adopted the current nuclear policy
 jawaab dete hue uske kuch hi hafton ke bheetar pakistan ne bhi kai parmaanu pareekshan kiye
 The 2014 Election Manifesto had said in this regard that it would review and update this policy keeping in view the challenges of the present times
 tippaniyan Parrikar also said, "earlier every four-five days, he was threatened by the Defense Minister of the neighboring country that if he was threatened he would use tactical nuclear weapons, but the day after the surgical strike, then again any threat Did not come '' It is worth mentioning that 19 soldiers were killed in an attack by Pakistani terrorists at an army camp in Uri, Kashmir
 uske baad bharat ne elosi ke paar jaakar sargical strike kiya
 Pakistan denied any such incident

 Chinese technology giant Xiaomi has launched its flagship smartphone i
e
 MI 6 in Pakistan
 isaki keemat 46,999 rupee he
 In Pakistan, it will be sold through Xiaomi Store Pakistan and Daraz
 yah khabar isliye ahm he, kyonki ise bharat main abhi tak launch nahin kiya gaya he
 Significantly, India is one of the biggest market for Xiaomi and this brand is quite popular here

 In the same year, Xiaomi launched its flagship smartphone Mi 6 in China and it is expected that it will also be launched in India
 chunki company china main product launch ke kuch maheene baad duusare deshon main launch karti he, isliye customers ko isaki besabri se intjaar tha
 However, in the meantime, reports came that Xiaomi has decided to never launch its flagship MI6 in India
 bharat main MI 6 nahin launch karne kii vajahen to saaf nahin he
 Because when we asked Manu Kumar Jain, Vice President and Country Head of the company about it, he refused to say anything clearly
 unhone bas itnaa kaha ki aane vaale samay main bharat main shaomi ke duusare smartphone launch honge
 But here, the reason behind not launching Mi 6 was not given
 unhone yah bhi nahin bataaya ki ise launch kiya bhi jayega yaa nahin
 It is worth noting that Xiaomi has launched many such smartphones in India which was introduced in China a year ago
 shaomi ke phans kai baar yah sawaal uthaate hai ki bharat main products kaaphi let se kyon launch kiye jate hai or itnaa hi nahin kai smartfones baar bharat main launch hi nahin hote
 We asked Manu Jain, Vice President and Country Head of Xiaomi, why smartphones in India are launched late and many products are not even launched
 iske jawaab main unhone kaha, ‘shaomi ko bharat main apana bijness shuru kiye hue abhi teen saal hi hue hai or ham sirf product launch karnaa nahin chaahate balki isaki sarvice bhi behatar rakhana chaahache hai
 Our setup here is small and is being gradually expanded and more products will start to be launched in the coming time ''
 However, Xiaomi is preparing to launch a two-camera smartphone in India next month
 manu jainane twit karke isaki jaankaree di he ki bharat main company kaa pehla dual camera vaala smartphone launch kiya jayega
 It is expected that this budget smartphone will be Redmi 5X
 lekin agar pakistan main Mi 6 launch kar diya gaya to aisa sambhav he ki agle maheene ise bharat main launch kiya jaae

 (with IANS input) mukhyamantri raghuvar das ne pradesh main dijal par waite badhaane ke rajya mantrimandal ke faisle ko guuruuvaar ko waapas le liya
 CM said that because of the cabinet's decision to increase VAT, 4 in the price of diesel
 20 rupee prati litre kii vruddhi honi thi, jo ab nahin hogi
 The decision to increase VAT on diesel has been withdrawn following strong opposition
 cabinet ne mangalvaar ko hui baithak mendijal or petrolpar waite badhaane kaa faisla liya
 The price of diesel in it is minimum 12
 5 rupee prati litre yaa 22 fisadi (jo adhik hoga) utana waite liya janaa tay hua tha
 Whereas in case of petrol, it was decided to levy VAT of Rs 15 per liter or 22 per cent (which would be more)
 petrol par lage waite ko waapas lene ke sambandh main poochne par mukhyamantri ne kaha ki petrol ke maamle main faisla abhi barkaraar he, lekin padosi rajyon dwaara petrol par liye jane vaale waite ko dekhte hue is par punarvichaar kiya jayega
 What and how much Asrarratan Kumar told that at present the price of petrol in Jharkhand is 60 rupees 27 paise per liter, of which VAT share is 22 per cent, 10 rupees fifty paise per liter, and this is now due to the decision of the Cabinet on Tuesday
 Rs
 Per liter and the total price of petrol will increase by about four and a half rupees per liter to 64 rupees 77 paise per liter
 isi tarah dijal kii jharkhand main vartmaan dar 47 rupee 41 paise prati litre main 22 fisadi kii dar se waite kaa hissaa sirf lagbhag aath rupee tees paise prati litre he, jo nae nirnay ke lagu hone ke baad nunatam 12 rupee pachaas paise prati litre ho jayega
 Due to this, diesel in Jharkhand will be expensive by about four rupees twenty paise per liter, totaling 51 rupees 61 paise per liter

 congress alaakaman ne haryana main nae formule ke saath aage badhane kii taiyaari kii he
 Not only BJP but also Congress is avoiding Jat leadership in Haryana
 congress ne rajya main party kii kaman ek dalit ke haathon se lekar duusare dalit ko saunpane kii yojana banaai he
 It is believed that soon Congress State President Ashok Tanwar can be removed from his post and Kumari Selja can be given the command of the party in the state
 bataa den ki haryana main congress pradesh adhyaksh ashok tanvar or rajya ke purvamukhyamantri bhupinder singh hoodake bich kaaphi samay se varchasv kii jang chal rahi he
 Hooda was adamant that the party's command in the state be handed over from Ashok Tanwar to any member of his faction
 sutron ke mutabik congress hooda kii tanvar ko hataane kii maang par to raji he, lekin party kii kaman unke khemen ke kisi sadsy ko die jane ke khilaaf he
 After this, Hooda also agreed to retreat
 ab wo ashok tanvar kii jagah kisi ko bhi nayaa adhyaksh bana dene par raji hai
 In such a situation, the party has planned to command the state-led Dalit women leader Kumari Seljako Party, on which Hooda has agreed
 haal hi main hui baithak main party upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi or congress mahasachiv kamalnath ne hooda samet rajya ke kai senior netaaon ke saath baatcheet kii thi
 It was agreed to replace Kumari Selja in place of Tanwar
 ashok tanvar ke saath haryana vidhansabha main vipaksh kii netaa kiran choudhary kii bhi chuttee tay maani ja rahi he or unki jagah hooda kheme ke kisi sadsy ko pratipaksh kaa netaa banaaya ja saktaa he
 It is worth mentioning that Bhupinder Singh Hooda belongs to Jat community and there is a significant number of Jat voters in the state
 rajya main jat ke baad duusari sabase badi aabaadi daliton kii he
 Had the Congress removed Ashok Tanwar to any member of the Hooda camp, its message among the Dalits would have been wrong
 isi vajah se congress nae formule ke saath aage bad rahi he, taaki jat ke saath-saath dalit bhi naaraaz na ho saken
 The Congress leadership is feeling that the dalit-jat pair in the State Congress Committee and the Congress Legislature Party can revive the party in the state
 congress ko lagata he ki donon matadaata ekajute ho jate hai to 2019 ke loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav main party paracham laharaa sakati he
 The Congress feels that both the Jats and Dalits are marginalized and feel isolated after the Khattar government came to power in Haryana
 aise rajya main dalit-jat kii jodi uske liye sanjivani sabit ho sakati he

 As soon as he came, he first talked to Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung about forming a government in Delhi
 sutron ke mutabik centre sarkaar dilli main chunaav karaane ke paksh main he
 However, other aspects are also being considered

 Then it will be decided

 Congress is challenging that BJP should hold elections
 vahi aam aadmi party ke netaa arvind kejariwal ne bhi kaha he ki agar modi lahar he to chunaav kyon nahin karaate
 Kejriwal also claims that Modi's wave will be halted by colliding with AAP in Delhi
 kejariwal ne kaha he ki court kii fatkaar ke baad agar bijepi main jaraa bhi shame baaki he to use chunaav karaane chahie
 If Jung has no idea then why did he invite BJP to form gvt? What is he doing in d chair of LG? Playing games?

 The court asked the Center how the BJP would form the government
 sarkaar banane main ho rahi deree or bahumat ke aankade par bhi adaalat ne sawaal khadey kiye
 The Central Government argued that the President had approved the proposal of the Lieutenant Governor in which there was talk of inviting the largest party to form the government
 is par vakil prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki sarkaar chuha billi kaa khel khel rahi he
 The Supreme Court also expressed displeasure over the government's plea

 That is, after one and a half months, the party is in the mood to take a decision
 dilli ke bijepi adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay ne bhi kaha he ki party sahi samay par sahi faisla karegi

 input- bhashaa In April 2008, when i wrote the eighth paper on the subject in 19 years, i felt as if i had no more words to describe the poor state of the Indian bureaucracy
 ek dashak or nauveen aavaran katha ke baad bhi, halaat jas ke tas hi hai
 In fact, today, if a bureaucrat of the British Raj of a century ago comes into the future while traveling, he will still have the same experience in a government office of the second decade of the 21st century as he had ever left - a slow decision-making process, such as an orderly troop, damp offices, and shifting, where the progress of a nation is measured by the number of settling files
 bhartiya civil seva ko aupniveshik yug kii ek lagaan vasuulne vaali sanstha se badalakar vikaas, garibi unmoolan or parivartan ko samarpit sanstha banane main vifaltaa, bharat kii pragati ke raah kii sabase badi baadhaon main se ek he
 The Indian bureaucracy looks back to the era of Baba Adam
 jis yug main motargadiyaan bhi driver rahit hone ko hai, us yug main hamaari sarkaar ko isi baiylgaadee ke sahare chalanaa he
 Out of every government rupee sent to the common man, only 15 paise reaches that person, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's remark was also related to the bureaucracy sucking up money at many levels
 aaj, digitalykaran main pragati ke saath aise daawey kiye ja rahe hai ki akele aadhaar yojana ne kareeb 20 lakh farji labhaarthiyon ko khatm kar diya he, lekin jis tantra ke upar sarkaar ke naaron or vaadon ko dharaatal par utaarne kii jimmedaari he uskaa kaamkaaj ab bhi kaagaj par hi chalata he
 i often hear ministers proudly saying that they handle so many files in a day
 filon kii sankhya is baat kaa pramaan hoti hai ki ve apana daayitv nibhaane ke liye kitni kadi mehnat kar rahe hai
 To be honest, their point shows how much they have been stuck in the mindset of the old licensee raj
 ek mantri kaa kaam nitiyaan or ranneetiyaan bananaa he
 They should see how the number of files can be reduced and government control can be minimized
 afsos kii baat he ki naukarshahi kaa ravaiya ab bhi sab kuch apane niyantran main rakhane vaala na ki chizon ke sarleekaran vaala he
 Here the focus is on completing the process and not on how to reach the desired results
 kaam-kaaj ke dauraan hone vaali galatiyon se apni gardan bachaakar rakhane par dhyaan rahata he
 India, with 51 ministries, is one of the countries with the highest number of ministries in the world
 isamen maine 53 vibhaagon or 83 aayogon ko nahin gina he
 In all, there is an overwhelming passion for paperwork, which leads to unnecessary and inordinate delays in decision making
 isi se naukarshahi ke pahie main chiknayee daalane kii parampara shuru hui jo badastoor chali aa rahi he
 Apart from corruption, hesitation in decision making is also the biggest problem of bureaucracy
 ummid he ki bhrashtachar rokthaam adhinium main sanshodhan, jiske praavdhaan kehete hai ki sarkaar kii anumati ke bina kisi naukarshah par mukadmaa nahin chalaaya ja saktaa, ke saath naukarshahi ke paas ab apni niskriyata ke liye koi or bahaanaa nahin bachegaa
 But it also threatens to further solidify the nexus between politicians and babus
 ye samasyaayein sidhe shashan kii gunvattta ko prabhavit karti hai
 If the decision-making process gets speeded up, regulatory hurdles are over, and doing business in India becomes really easy, then the government can benefit billions of rupees and all this can happen only if the government is the bureaucratic authority of the country
 Make the process faster than replacing the one in your clutches
 shashan-vyavastha par 2017 main hue vishwa bank ke ek adhyayan, jisane desh kii naukarshahi kii gunvattta, rajnatik dabaav se swatantraaa or niti nirmaan tathaa karyanvayan kii gunvattta kaa akalan kiya tha, main bharat kii naukarshahi ko vaishvik str par 45wein percentaile par rakhaa gaya
 It has fallen by about 10 percentage points in the last two decades and this is enough to describe the bureaucratic situation
 jaahir he, vyapak paimaane par sudhaar kii jarurat he
 Over the years, many committees have suggested various measures related to radical changes in the bureaucracy
 inamen visheshgyon ko prashikshit karke shashan-vyavastha main shaamil karne ke liye prashikshan santhaan sthapit karne se lekar yogyata-aadhaarit bhartee pranali dwaara logon ko chunakar, unhen kade prashikshan ke baad nichle str par naukarshahi main jimmedaariyaan dene ke suzav shaamil the
 No suggestions implemented
 editor (research) ajit kumaar jha dwaara prastut hamaari aavaran katha, kuch haalia badlaavon ke prakaash main bharat kii naukarshahi kii maujuuda sthiti kii samiksha karti he
 These include the 360 degree cadre nomination evaluation process which emphasizes merit rather than seniority, the Prevention of Corruption (amendment) Act, 2018 and the appointment of some experts to the top posts of bureaucracy by lateral entry (lateral entry) process
 haalanki, ye upaay bhi bilkul vaise hi dikhte hai jaise ham baiylgaadee main rabar ke pahie lagaakar khush hone lagen ki hamane apni gaadi apadet kar lee he, jabaki jarurat to gaadi badalane kii thi
 In June this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India would soon become a $ 5 trillion economy
 yah tab tak sapana hi bana rahegaa jab tak ki pradhanmantri naukarshahi main buniyadi sudhaar kaa kaam shuru nahin karte
 So far, he has only expanded the role of government
 unhen ab adhiktam shashan, nunatam sarkaar ke 2014 ke apane naare ko lagu karke dikhaane kii jarurat he
 The country is waiting

 duusari dikkat yah he ki yah yojana uljhi hui isliye he kyonki ho saktaa he ki kisi maheene, udhaaharan ke liye aktubar main kisi shatabdi main yatriyon kii sankhya pichley saal isi maheene main 50 fisadi se kam rahi he to aktubar main to us train main chhot mil jaaegi
 But if the number of passengers in the same train is 50 percent or more in November last year, then there will be no exemption
 itnaa hi nahin ap or down train ke kiraye ko lekar bhi gafalat ho sakati he
 For example, in Bhopal Shatabdi, if the number of passengers from Delhi to Bhopal is less than 50 percent in November last year, then there will be a rebate
 lekin isi train main yadi pichley saal november main hi bhopal se dilli ke yatriyon kii sankhya 50 fisadi se adhik rahi he to chhot nahin milegi
 Since the responsibility of implementing this system will remain with the Chief Commercial Manager, there can be confusion over the fare of trains coming and going
 haalanki railway adhikari yah daawa kar rahe hai ki is yojana se yatriyon kii sankhya main badhottaree hogi

 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh may be known worldwide as a brilliant economist, but former TRAI Chairman Pradeep Baijal has a different opinion
 unke mutabik,manmohan singh kaa ravaiya'gaiyr-arthshaastreey' tha or unka raajnneetik najariya 'desh kii arthvyavastha ke liye nuksaandaayak' tha
 He has also called the upa's second term as 'crony capitalism'
 baijal nipani kitaab'da complit story of indian riforms: 2ji, power and privet enterprise- a practicenurs diary' main ye daawey kiye hai
 According to the news published in the English newspaper Times of India, Baijal wrote that when Manmohan was the chairman of the Parliamentary Subcommittee on Disinvestment, in 2002 (during the NDA government) he 'cross-married' me and his attitude towards privatization Laker was extremely negative
 baijal ne likhaa he, 'main 1991 main unki ore se laai gai udaarvaad kii nitiyon par hi kaam kar rahaa tha
 Still he was unhappy
 main unke gaiyr-arthshaastreey ravaiye or arthvyavastha ke liye khatarnaak raajnneetik najariye par hairaan rah gaya
 "cooperate in 2G, otherwise you will suffer" In the same book, Baijal has also accused Manmohan of a serious case in the 2G scam
 unhone daawa kiya he ki pradhanmantri ne unhen sahyog na karne par 'nuksaan' uthaane kii baat kahi thi
 In his book, Baijal has written that the allegations of UPA-2 nekhud to tarnish someone else's head were tarnished
 gauratlab he ki adhikariyon ne is cese main baijal kii bhoomika kii bhi lambey samay tak jaanch kii thi
 The English newspaper 'times of India' reported this
 baijal ke mutabik, 'mere jaise beurocret kii sthiti aisi thi ki 'kuch karo to afat' or 'na karo to afat'
 i warned many people involved in UPA-2 that the investigation against me and other officials could eventually go to the Prime Minister as he was the one who approved the decisions of all ministers and ministries
 dayaanidhi maaran, e raja or koyala mantri ke kaamon ko unhone hi hari jhandi di thi aurasieji ne jo nuksaan rajkosh ko bataaya he, usamen vah bhi baraabar ke doshi hai
 Baijal made these claims in his book 'the Complete Story of Indian Reforms: 2G, Power and Private Enterprise - a Practitioner's Diary'
 'samasyaayein kaise shuru huin' naam ke ek chapter main baijal ne daawa kiya he, 'maine 2004 main dayaanidhi maaran ko telecom mantri banaae jane par PM manmohan singh se apni ashanka jataai thi
 Because it was a matter of conflict of interest
 maaran ek broadcaster the or 2004 main hi broadcast regular ke rup main tri kaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 But according to Baijal, Manmohan Singh dismissed his concerns saying that this is not a matter of conflict of interest as TRAI is an independent regulator and separate ministry of information and broadcasting and telecom
 baijal ne manmohan singh ko us vakt kaa 'pradhanmantri, telecom' tak kaha he
 According to him, Manmohan used to take all decisions related to telecom
 baijal ke mutabik, 'unhone kaha ki agar main unke nirdesh nahin maanoonga to mujhe baari nuksaan uthaanaa padegaa
 His words proved to be right because i have suffered a lot since then

 Elections are going on in Gujarat but Delhi is not untouched by its impact
 patidaar anamat andolan samiti ke sanyojak hardik patel gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main kitna bada factor sabit hote hai ye to 18 disambar ko matganana ke nattejey aane ke baad hi saaf ho paaegaa
 Hardik Patel is waging Alakh against BJP in Gujarat, so the Congress is happy to be with Hardikka
 gujarat main hardik kii reliyon main unke samarthak josh ke saath jutate hai
 But it is not that Hardik has the unanimous support of the Patidar community
 kuch patidaar bhi hardik ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaate rahe hai
 Something similar was seen on Wednesday
 lekin gujarat ke kisi shahar main nahin, desh kii rajdhani dilli main
 Demonstration was held against Rajghat Parahardik
 khud ko patel samudaay kaa sadsy bataane vaale kuch log rajghat par hardik patel ke khilaaf binar poster or putala lekar pahunch gaye
 Slogans were raised against Hardik Patel first with full force of the throat
 baad main hardik ke putale par chappal-juuton se jamkar bhadaas nikaali gai
 The effigy was then set on fire
 ye sab chal rahaa tha to aaj tak / india today reporter ne hardik ke khilaaf aakrosh prakat karne waalon ke man kii thaah leni chaahi
 For this, the first thing talked to the lady Pooja Gaur who was participating in the demonstration
 ye mahila apane chote bachche ko god main liye dilli ke timarpur ilaake se rajghat par pradarshan main hissaa lene pahunchi thi
 When he was asked the purpose of coming, he got the answer, 'we were told that Rajghat is to be walked, sitting empty at home, so we came
 ’thahrie kahani yahi khatm nahin hoti, balki yahaan se shuru hoti he
 Now it was talked to a young man who was wearing a white T-shirt with the picture of Sardar Patel
 santosh jha naam ke is yuva se jab poocha gaya ki jiske khilaaf aap jorshor se naare laga rahe hai, unke bare main kya jaanate hai to muskuraate hue jawaab mila, “ye pehle bijepi main the, ab congress ke saath pataa nahin kyon chale gaye
 We have come to protest against Hardik Patel
 ” santosh jha ne aage badi sharafat se ye bhi sweekaar kar liya ki wo nahin jaantehardik patelkun hai?pradarshnakariyon ke samooh ke jaraa peeche kii ore gaye to rajkumaar naam ke shaks khadey dikhaai die
 The prince lost in his thoughts when asked why he came here
 badi maasoomiyat ke saath jawaab mila- ‘naare lagane aae hai
 'they were asked whether they would get some remuneration for this work? Hear what the prince said on this, listen to their words - 'they have come to raise slogans, have not given money, will give it after work is done
 ’yahi kissa aage bhi badha
 While the men in the protesters were busy burning effigies and shouting slogans, in one corner some women were seen sitting with children
 unase jab poocha gaya ki kya vehardik patelke bare main jaanati hai to zyaadaatar ne jawaab ‘nahin’ main diya
 When women wanted to know if they were from the Patel community, the answer was also found in 'na'
 ye sab chal rahaa tha to kuch ladkiyaan bhi vahaan aa gayi
 These girls also came to sit in the bus to perform at Rajghat
 jab in ladakiyon se unke aane kaa makasad poocha gaya to unhone mana ki ghar par koi kaam nahin tha isliye yahaan raily main chali ain
 When asked if they would get some money for participating in the demonstration, the girls replied that they would get money after the rally was over
 ek ladki ne khul kar bataa bhi diya- 'ek ghante ke 100 rupye milenge
 'so this was the identity of the truth' Bapu's Samadhi 'rajghat' was the truth of the 'serious demonstration' organized against Parahardik Patel
 desh main 8 november ko pradhanmantri ne jaise hi notebandi kii ghoshnaa kii puure desh kii najar ghar main padey cash ke saath-saath apane-apane bainkon par padi
 As a result of this decision, if the common man stood in the queue of bank and ATM, then the biggest challenge before the banks was to protect their account holders from the ill effects of demonetization at the earliest
 notebandi ne desh ke sarkari or gaiyr-sarkari 1,38,868 bank branchon ko desh kii 86 fisadi karency badalane ke liye tainaat kar diya
 Banks were given 50 days to do this work
 notebandi kii di gai miyaad main desh ke lagbhag sabhi bainkon ne apane kaam ko ji tod mehnat karte hue bakhubi niptaya
 Despite this, many such incidents were seen across the country, which led to the same bank becoming the biggest villain of demonetisation
 1
 In the span of 50 days, all the branches of the banks were engaged in just one attempt to change the old currency of 500 and 1000 rupees to face the least difficulties of 125 crore citizens of the country
 2
 All these bank branches deposited more than 90 percent of the old currency in 50 days
 iske saath hi rigerv bank dwaara jari kii gai nai karency kaa bhi lagbhag 50 fisadi sanchaar is di gai miyaad ke andar kar liya gaya
 3
 is prakriya ke dauraan exis bank samet kai chote-bade sarkari or privet bainkon par blikemani ko white karne kaa kai aarope laga
 Even due to these allegations, the arrest of senior officials of many banks, including the Reserve Bank, was over
 ise bhi padhein: modi sarkaar ko cash se dikkat lekin japan main top gear par he cash iconomi4
 However, during this period, the biggest question that arose on the banks of the country was that when the central bank instructed to distribute the new currency only by rationing, then how came the case of seizure of new currency in the market
 5
 During the time of demonetisation, along with raising the finger on the banks, their regulator Reserve Bank was also questioned
 blike ko white karne ke liye puraani karency ke badale nai karency uplabdh karaane main rigerv bank par bhi sawaal uthaaya gaya
 6
 bainko par or sangeen aarope laga ki notebandi kii miyaad ke dauraan desh ke sarkari bainkon main khule lagbhag 21 karod jandhan bank khaaton kaa jamkar durupyog kiya gaya
 At that time, there were 26 crore Jan Dhan accounts in the country
 vahiin notebandi ke elaan ke turant baad nae jandhan khaaton ko kholane kii raftaar main hue ijaphe se yah sawaal khadaa hua ki bainkon ki mileebhagat se puraani karency main pade blikemani ko white karne kii koshish kii gai
 7
 notebandi ke elaan kaa samay bhi desh main kai pariwaron ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab bana
 It was the time of the wedding season in the country, so many families who had withdrawn money from the bank and those who had to withdraw money just before marriage got badly trapped
 is maamle main pareshaan hue logon ko mahasoos hua ki jis din ke liye unhone bank par bharosa kar apni seaving rakhi thi samay padane par bainkon ne unke saath nyaay nahin kiya
 Though within a few days, the Central Bank took cognizance of the matter and gave a decree to give more than the fixed currency to the banks for this special provision, but that too did not succeed in meeting the needs of the people
 8
 The biggest drawback after the announcement of demonetisation was that the Central Government had declared 86 percent of the country's currency as illegal but did not make any concrete arrangements to bring the new currency to the people
 gauratlab he ki notebandi ke elaan ke baad sarkaar ko yah maaloom chalaa ki puraani note kii jagah laai gai nai note ko deshbhar main maujuud atm main lagane main takniki dikkat he lihaaja logon ko 10-15 din tak atm se nai note paane kaa intjaar karnaa padaa
 9
 ab bainkon ke villen banane kaa asli mauka notebandi kii miyaad khatm hone ke baad ai
 Due to the queues ahead of the banks and the increasing functioning, almost all the banks in the country started charging the facilities provided to the account holders
 yah chargees bank se cash lenden, atm se cash nikasi samet graahakon ko milane vaali lagbhag sabhi suvidhaon par lagaaya gaya
 It is worth noting that by taking advantage of the opportunity of demonetization with these new charges, all the banks also increased their earnings
 ab in paristhitiyon main is baat ko nakaara nahin ja saktaa ki desh ke bainkon ne bhale ji tod mehnat kii lekin is prakriya kii advance taiyaari nahin karne ke chalate use notebandi kaa villen bananaa padaa

 Senior social activist Anna Hazare on Monday defended key member of his team Kiran Bedi and criticized the 'group of four' for opposing the Jan Lokpal Bill
 ajtak LIVE TV dekhne ke liye clic karankiran bedi par yatra bilon kaa adhik bhugtan lene kaa aarope he
 These days, Anna Hazare, wearing a silent vow, wrote on his blog that if the government feels that Bedi has used the money for her personal interest then it should be investigated and if she is found guilty then strict action against her Should be done
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf aap bhi len shapathunhone likhaa he ki kuch logon kaa yah mantra ban gaya he ki ve logon ko aaropee tehraaen or unhen apamaanit karen
 He said that this is not the first time that Bedi has been accused, accusing several members of Team Anna, and even a 'group of four' character attack
 ye log koun hai? ye vahi log hai jo jan lokapal ke samarthan main nahin hai
 Anna Hazare, however, did not disclose the names of the 'group of Four'
 is bich anna hajaare ke purv sahyogi swami agnivesh ne somvaar ko team anna par nae aarope lagaae
 He said that the details of the money raised during Anna Hazare's Ramlila Maidan fast should be made public, while environmental activist Medha Patkar dismissed the allegation of irregularity and said that the truth will be revealed soon
 isse pehle agnivesh ne arvind kejariwal par aarope lagaaya tha ki unhone india against karpshan main jutaaye gaye 70 se 80 lakh rupee apane nijee trust main daal die
 Patkar is a member of the main committee of India Against Corruption

 Patkar said that Agnivesh was not present in the meeting of the main committee, so he cannot say about Anna's displeasure
 nishchit rup se unhone sthiti ko galat tareeke se samajha hoga
 Meanwhile, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh also attacked Kejriwal
 unhone kaha, 'bhartiya janata party kejariwal ko sahyog kar rahi he
 There seems to be a connection between the two
 meri baat phir se sahi sabit hui
 He said, "he is a supporter of Right to Information and believes in transparency
 isliye unhen sach batalaana chahie

 Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray has targeted the ally BJP over the results of the four state assembly by-elections
 uddhav ne saamana main likhaa he ki keval laharon kii badaulat chunaav nahin jite jate

 uddhav ne aage likhaa he ki bihar or karnataka ke nateezon kaa adhyayan karne kii jarurat he
 Also, there is a need to strengthen the alliance of Shiv Sena and BJP in Maharashtra

 The SPG amendment bill has been passed by the Legislative Protection Group (SPG) Amendment Bill 2019 from the Rajya Sabha after the Lok Sabha, following the signing of the President by the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha
 is bill main sirf pradhanmantri ko SPG suraksha dene kaa praavdhaan he or unke alaava koi bhi vishisht vyakti is suraksha kavach kaa hakdaar nahin hoga
 Legally, no member of the Gandhi family will be able to remain under SPG protection after amending the bill
 vahiin, pradhanmantri pad se hatane ke 5 saal baad vishisht vyakti se bhi yah suraksha waapas lee jaaegi
 The Congress strongly opposed this bill

 If anything happens, who will take responsibility for it? bike hariprasad ne kaha ki kya grih mantri bina suraksha ke gum sakate hai
 When the bill was being voted on in the Rajya Sabha, Congress mps walked out of the House
 haalanki congress ke virodh ke baavjood bill rajyasabha se paas ho gaya
 There was also a protest in the Lok Sabha when Amit Shah introduced this bill in the Lok Sabha, there was a lot of uproar
 amit shah ke bill pesh kiye jane ke baad congress party kii ore se manish tiwari ne is bill par apni baat rakhi thi or gandhi parivaar kii suraksha hataae jane ko raajnneeti se prerit bataaya tha
 Only after the change in this bill, SPG security was removed from Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, while now their security is in the hands of CRPF

 This is the fifth change that is compatible with the original spirit
 is act ke tahat espiji protection sirf piem or unke parivaar ke saath jo unke saath adhikrut piem awaas main rahete hai unako hi praapt hoga
 Apart from this, this protection will also be withdrawn after 5 years of his removal from the post of PM
 ye bill donon hi sadanon se paas ho gaya he
 After the President's signature on the bill, it will take the shape of law
 rajyasabha main amit shah ne kya bolgamit shahne kaha ki sabase pehle is bill ko lekar jo bhrantiyaan hai vah main dur karnaa chahta hum
 This bill has not been brought into consideration with the Gandhi family
 act ke andar chaar baar parivartan hue hai
 This is the fifth change
 yah paanchavaa parivartan kisi parivaar ke kaaran nahin hua he
 The first 4 changes that were made were made with a family in mind
 amit shah ne kaha ki sirf gandhi parivaar kii suraksha hi nahin desh kii 130 karod janata kii suraksha kii jimmedaari modi sarkaar kii he
 But i do not understand the insistence that i want SPG

 Although the PDP has remained silent on Mehbooba Mufti's statement, the BJP says that Speaker Kavinder Gupta has removed Mehbooba's anti-national statement
 bijepi ne kaha he ki unki artical 370 kii niti par koi badlaav nahin he or sarkaar banane ke liye party ne gathbandhan kiya he
 With the statement of this article 370 of Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, he has corrected his reputation in the Kashmir Valley but the Congress and the National Conference have created a headache for the BJP in Jammu

 Headley's testimony, broadcast on a 52-inch flat-screen LCD TV monitor in Sanap's court, was made possible in lieu of his pardon from the trial court
 yah kisi bhi duusari gavaahi kii tarah nahin thi
 Headley's LCD monitor was placed in the right corner of the court room in such a way that a second LCD screen was displayed in front of him, on the other side of a Mumbai police constable, unaware
 jundaal hindustani naagarik tha jise 2011 main saudi arab se laayaa gaya tha

 In his six-hour-long testimony to the mysterious incumbency, Headley told Tafseel how the so-called "non-governmental character" of lashkar-e-taiba was deeply involved with the mysterious power of Pakistan, especially its many-headed inter-services Intelligence (ISI)
 Were connected lashkar ke haathon anjaam die gaye 26 / 11 ke katleam kii yojana mukammal dhang se is tarah banaai gai thi, taaki usase “bharosemand tareeke se inkaar” kiya ja sake or koi suraag uske mujarimon ke girebaan tak na pahunch sake
 The attack was carried out by 10 heavily armed terrorists who were killed in the attack, but they used SIM cards from India and they were carrying ID cards in which they were identified as students of Hyderabad College
 lekin shukr he 26 / 11 kii raat ajmal kasaab jinda pakadaa gaya or 2009 ke bitate-bitate hedli bhi giraftaar ho gaya, varanaa jaanch andhe muhane par jaakar khatm ho jaati
 Headley's testimony now names four serving officers of ISI & Brigadier Riaz, Major Sameer Ali, Lt Col Hamza and Major Iqbal
 uski gavaahi ne ab pakistan sena ko 26 / 11 kii mumbai sajeesh se sidhe-sidhe jod diya he
 (indian intelligence officers believe that ISI men may have used fake names)
 hedli kii gavaahi main in afasaron kaa naam handler yaa afasaron kii taur par liya gaya he, jinhone iesai or lashkar ke liye bichauliyon ke taur par dekharekh kii yaa kaam kiya
 According to Headley, each of the let operatives, even Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, his supremo, was an ISI handler
 is tarah is inkaar kii ab rahi-sahi dhajjiyaan bhi ud gai hai ki mumbai hamalon ke bare main pakistan sena puri tarah andhkaar main thi
 Lashkar was clearly determined to attack Mumbai
 yah sajeesh 2006 main rachi gai
 This was the year that Headley changed his name and entered Mumbai to start his killer Reiki
 pataa nahin kyon, lashkar ke sir par taj mahal hotel par hamalaa karne kaa khabt savaar tha
 In 2007, he used a video of Headley's Reiki to create a copy of the hotel within Pakistan
 unhone raksha vaigyanikon ke jamaavade par hamalaa karne kii yojana banaai thi, jo vahaan sammelan karne vaale the
 How much this faction was intent on attacking the city was revealed when Headley revealed that in August 2008 he had made two unsuccessful attempts to force the same group of 10 terrorists into the city
 vishesh sarkari vakil nikam kehete hai, “yah saaf he ki lashkar or iesai ke bich najdiki sathganth he
 "how close this nexus is, it became clear from Headley's further testimony
" uski gavaahi bataati he ki lashkar kii aguai karne vaali jamaat main iesai kii jabardast dakhal or ghuspaith he
 Hence there was Brigadier Riaz, who handled the military commander of Lashkar zaki-ur-rehman; Major Iqbal was Headley's handler in the ISI; And Iqbal's boss was Lieutenant Hamza

 He trained as a foot soldier of Lashkar and even offered to fight in Kashmir

 He was the real double agent who changed his name in 2006 on orders from Lashkar

 The government has indicated that it will soon send a new dossier to Pakistan based on Headley's statements
 kya vastav main isse koi fark padegaa, jabaki pakistan ko bheje gaye dheron dogiyaron ko abhi dekha janaa baaki he? khaskar isliye ki pakistani sena ab bhi apana hukum chalaati he or lagata nahin he ki vah apni dekharekh main chal rahi aatank kii mashin ko rokane vaali he
 Bruce Reidel, an anti-terrorism expert and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, says, "there is nothing new in Headley's statement that the ISI was behind the planning of the Mumbai attacks, but it is an important fact that the Pakistani military still continues to be terrorists Gives protection to ”modi sarkaar ko tab kaaphi niraashaa hui thi jab lashkar ke commander lakhvi ko pichley saal april main jamaanat par jail se reeha kar diya gaya tha, or 2009 main shuru hua mukadmaa taany-taany fiss ho gaya tha
 Modi has raised this issue several times with Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
 pakistan ne kaha he ki use 26 / 11 hamalon par abhi or “jaankariyon or sabooton kii jarurat” he
 Three parallel lawsuits in the 26 / 11 attacks & 2013 trial in the US in which Headley was jailed for 35 years, the 2012 verdict which sentenced Ajmal Kasab, the only surviving terrorist, to be hanged, and the 2009 trial, in which an anti-terrorist in Pakistan The court had registered a case and this is the last one which seems to end without any result

 "the Government of Pakistan has not yet reacted to Headley's statements, but at the time of the 26 / 11 attacks, Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik has dismissed his statements as" a bundle of lies "and" fabricated statements "
 malik kaa kahana he bhartiya khufia agenciyon ne mumbai hamalon ko anjaam dene or managasaint bayaan dilaane ke liye hedli kaa istemaal kiya
 Pakistani journalist Hamid Mir says it will not be easy for Pakistani security agencies to ignore Headley's claims in the Indian court
 ve kehete hai, “hedli koi bhartiya naagarik nahin he
 He is an American citizen of Pakistani descent and has not given all his statements while in Indian custody, but in US custody

 In November 2010, a big mystery mystery involving events preceding an expert detective 26 / 11 attacks was solved to some extent
 26 / 11 hamalon ke kuch maheene pehle mumbai par hamalon ke bare main jo dheron khufia chetavaniyaan mil rahi thim, uskaa strot america tha
 Two years later, the US Directorate of National Intelligence (DNI) sent a report to the Ministry of Home Affairs of India stating that the US government had "let the Indian government raid several Mumbai targets between June and September 2008
" Special warnings about a-taiba's plans were provided
 ”america se milane vaali chetavaniyaan kaaphi spasht thim
 Between 2006 and 2008, IB and RAW received several intelligence reports
 2008 tak ye chetavaniyaan kaaphi tej ho chuki thim
 What was beyond comprehension, was how America was getting all this detailed information
 26 / 11 hamalon main mumbai police kii galatiyon kii jaanch ke liye gathit pradhan samiti ne bataaya ki kul 26 chetavaniyaan di gai thim, jinamein hotalon or sarkari imaaraton ko nishaanaa banane kii baat thi
 Three warnings were given up to the date of the attack on Mumbai: August 20, 2006, May 24 and August 11, 2008
 chah chetavaniyon main samudr se hamalaa karne kii sambhaavna bataai gai thi, 11 chetavaniyon main ek saath hamale kii ashanka jaahir kii gai, teen main in thikaanon par fidaayin hamale kii chetavanee di gai
 In September last year, DNI reported that "strategic warnings" continued until November
 central intelligence agency (siie) ke purv contractor edward snowden ne 2013 main khulaasa kiya ki siie ne mumbai hamale se thik aath din pehle 18 november ko ro ko ek chetavanee bheji thi
 The CIA obtained this information by tapping a conversation between the lashkar-e-taiba boat and the Lashkar headquarters in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
 siie ne yah chetavanee ro ko bhej di thi, or phir ro ne use bhartiya nausena or tatarakshak dal ko pahunchaa di thi, lekin maharashtra police ko yah chetavanee nahin di gai
 In this final warning, the Lashkar's boat al-husseini was reported to be in perfect condition when it left Karachi with ten attackers
 pradhan samiti ko dilli main ibi or ro kii mul jaankariyaan uplabdh karaane se manaa kar diya gaya tha
 In the warnings given by the central agencies at the dgp's office in Maharashtra, the rest of the information was already removed so that there could be no clue to the original sources of those warnings
 ro ke purv vishesh sachiv balachandran kehete hai, “aam taur par desh ke bheetar bhi soochna dete samay soochna dene vaale kaa naam nahin bataaya jaataa he
 Was there a spy inside Headley Lashkar who was constantly informing the US government about the Mumbai attacks plan? Given the dual move of Headley, this possibility does not seem shocking either
 ek maahir gupt agent ke taur par, jisane haal ke daur main sabase kukhyat hamalon main se ek main reki kaa kaam kiya tha or jin hamalon kii nakal 13 november, 2015 ko islamic state ke hamalaavaron ne bhi paris hamale main kii thi, hedli hameshaa apni sandigdh bhoomikaaon ke liye janaa jayega
 The way he is making revelations in the US can also lead to a different opinion about him, a conspiracy that has exposed the conspiracy of the real Pakistanis in terrorism
 israel or falstin ke bich ahm shanti vaarta kii shuruuaat ke bich america raashtrapati baraak obama ne hamaas ko chetavanee di he ki vah ise patari se utaarne ke liye khoonkhrabe kii ghatnaon ko anjaam na de

" 
 ’shanti vaarta shuru hone kii prakriya ke ek din pehle hamaas ke ek bandookdhaari ne pashchimi tat ke shahar hebron main israel ke chaar logon kii hatya kar di thi

" ’netaanyahu ne kaha ki obama kaa vaktavy aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang kii unki ichha ko pradarshit karata he
 At the same time, Obama said that the attack on the people of Israel has also condemned the President of Palestine, Mahmoud Abbas

 Tattoos have a direct impact on our body, mind and life, especially those tattoos which are in the form of a figure
 yani yadi aap ne apane sharir main koi akruti banavaai he to uskaa prabhaav aapke man, sharir or vyavhaar main aana tay he
 If you do not have salary in hand then do this remedy on Sunday, for example, if you have made a religious mark on your body in the form of a tattoo, like suppose you have made the figure of Om or Swastik on your body as a tattoo then You will benefit only when this figure is correctly created as a tattoo
 aapkaa man prasann rahegaa, confidence badhegaa, kaam banenge, safalataa milegi
 But if the tattoo maker has distorted the figure of Om or Swastik in the style of doing more style or doing something new, then its negative effect is sure to come on your mind, body and behavior
 
 
 
 So that's why it is special that the gemstone of the Sun first affects the mind, negative thinking can increase in your mind
 achaanak aap tension main rahane lag sakate hai
 Suddenly your behavior can start changing

 But people who have experimented in the matter of making something new, they have got more trouble
 isliye tatu banavaate samay saavdhaan rahen
 The sun's zodiac sign is changing
 Is tattoo related to astrology? If our body and mind are related to astrology, then everything related to body and mind comes under the realm of astrology

 yadi sone yaa chaandi yaa tambe kii anguthi, chen yaa koi bhi gahanaa pahana he to uskaa sambandh bhi grahon se he
 The cream or poder applied in the body is considered to be related to the planet Venus, if any part of the body is weak or lacking in it, then it is seen to be associated with a particular planet, as if the eye is weak then its relation to the Sun planet is considered

 Which can have an impact on our family, friends, career and society

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday accused the Congress of being soft on terrorism and said that China and Pakistan are unable to show their courage due to a strong bjp-led government at the Center
 unhone rourkela, angul evam phulbani main kii gai chunavi reliyon ke dauraan kaha ki desh kaa vikaas evam raashtra suraksha narendra modi sarkaar ke liye ek hi sikke ke do pahalu hai jo in par samjhauta nahin karti
 Adityanath claimed that the Chinese army used to infiltrate the Congress-led UPA government the day it came but it ended after Narendra Modi became Prime Minister
 unhone kaha ki samprag shashan ke dauraan pakistan, seemaa par hamaare sainikon ke sir kalam kar rahaa tha
 Now after Modi becomes Prime Minister, China and Pakistan cannot do such an audacity
 adityanath ne kaha samprag shashan ke dauraan pakistan ne berok tok bharat main hamale kiye lekin modi sarkaar ne aisa jawaab diya he ki ve phir kabhi aisa kuch nahin kar paaenge
 He blamed Congress for the country's failure to move fast in the path of development and accused him of taking a soft stand towards terrorists and Naxalites
 pulavama aatankwaadi hamale par bharat ke jawaab kaa zikr karte hue varisht bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki 40 siarpief javaanon kii hatya ke baad pakistan ko munhtod jawaab diya gaya jab bharat ne pakistan ke bheetar ghuskar (balakot main) aatankwaadi shiviron par hawaii hamalaa kiya

 With 42 days of demonetisation, 8 villages in the country have been declared cashless
 matlab yah ki ye 8 gaanv cash kaa istemaal nahin karte
 All adults have bank accounts here
 yahaan esemes or debit card ke jariye banking kii jaati he or chote se bade sabhi tranjaction ko karne ke liye log card swip karte or karaate hai
 If these 8 cashless villages include the first digital village in the country, Akodara (gujarat), then Lunura in Budgam district of Jammu and Kashmir and Dharmasagaram village in Visakhapatnam are also present
 iske alaava inamen telugana kaa ibrahimpur gaanv, maharashtra kaa dhasai gaanv, bihar ke maner main basti gaanv or kurji main bind toli or madhyapradesh main bhopal ke najadik badaziri gaanv shaamil hai
 After the 8 November Connotbandy, the cash crisis arose here like any village in the country
 gaanv ke log udhaar par sauda kharidne ko majaboor hue to gaanv ke dukandaaron ke saamne bhi udhaar dene se manaa na karne kii majaburi thi
 Neither had any cash in the village, nor could any new cash reach the nearby banks
 isi majaburi ke bich is gaanv ne cashles vyavastha kii taraf badhane kaa pehla kadam uthaaya or aaj puure desh ke liye misaal ban gaye hai
 Know how it is possible that these villages from North India to South India turned towards becoming cashless and why these villages declared themselves cashless before any city in the country
 1
 To make mobile villages cashless, at least one mobile phone connection is required in each family
 mobile phone parivaar ko shashakt karne kaa sabase ahm madhyam he
 Under the Digital India program, necessary infrastructure is being prepared to reach at least one mobile phone to every family in the country
 yah inhen koshishon ke chalate sambhav hua ki gujarat kaa akodera gaanv 2015 main desh kaa pehla digital gaanv bana or notebandi lagu hone ke baad vah aasaani se cashles gaanv main badal gaya
 2
 internet-gaanv-gaanv tak mobile phone pahunchane ke saath hi internet suvidha bhi pahunch rahi he
 With internet, the mobile phone works completely for you
 internet yukt mobile se aap ghar baithe apane bank se sampark kar sakate hai
 Mobile and Internet together form the first step towards cashless transactions
 notebandi lagu hone ke baad sabase pehle un logon ko cash kii killat se bachanaa sambhav hua jinhone pement karne ke liye mobile wolet jaisi suvidha kaa sahaara liya
 Therefore, these villages, with mobile phones and Internet facilities, took the most important step towards cashless village
 3
 Bank accounts - Special attention is being paid to Jan Dhan accounts in the country for the last two years
 kendra sarkaar ke is kaarykram ke tahat desh main un sabhi logon ko banking vyavastha se jodne kii koshish kii ja rahi he jo beete 60 varshon ke dauraan isse baahar rah gaye hai
 It was the result of these efforts that after demonetisation was implemented, people in these villages used their Jan Dhan or other bank account for mobile banking
 apane mobile or bank ko ek saath jodne ke baad jahaan gaanv main choti se choti kharidari karne ke liye log taiyaar the vahiin gaanv ke chote kaarobaariyon ne bhi in sevaaon kaa laabh lete hue in madhyamon par cell shuru kar di
 4
 sakshartaa-cashles gaanv banane kii disha main jaruri takniki vikaas ke saath-saath sakshartaa sabase ahm kirdaar adaa karti he
 In the villages declared cashless, educated people constantly tried to motivate more and more small and big shopkeepers to use technology to overcome the cash problem
 yah inhen koshishon kaa nateeja tha ki maharashtra ke dhasai gaanv main logon ne mumbai ke bank manager se sampark kar logon ko jaruri training dene or gaanv main cashles kharid-farokht karne ke liye jaldi se jaldi point of cell mashiinon ko paryaapt maatra main praapt kar liya
 Today, on the basis of literacy, educated people of these villages have turned the entire village towards cashless system

 Can only happen
 unhone kaha tha ki jald hi lagjri or 'sin guds' ko chhodkar anya sabhi vastuon par 28 fisadi jiesti slab khatm kiya ja saktaa he
 He also said in a Facebook post that the standard rate could be between 12 and 18 per cent
 jetali kaa jiesti blog teen hindi bhashi rajyon - chhattisgarh, madhya pradesh or rajasthan ke chunaav parinaam aane ke ek pakhwaade ke baad aayaa he
 The election results, which came a few months before the 2019 general elections, did not favor the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party at the Center
 aapako bataa den ki abhi kuch din pehle hi GST council ke baithak main kai vastuon se GST kam kiya tha
 The GST slab on these items was reduced from 28% to 18%
 100 rupee tak ke cinema tikat par GST ghataakar 12 fisadi kiya gaya he, jabaki 100 rupee se mahange cinema tikat par GST 28 fisadi se ghataakar 18 fisadi kiya gaya he

 Justice Sangita Dhingra Sehgal rejected the defense plea of the rape convict that the victim's silence about the incident was evidence of her consent to have sex
 hai court ne kaha ki aaropee ke bachaav kii is daleel kaa koi aadhaar nahin he ki peedita ne uske saath yon sambandh banane kii sahmati di thi jo ki ghatana ke bare main uski chuppi se sabit hota he
 Silence cannot be considered as proof of consent to have sex
 peeditane bhi yah kaha ki aaropee ne use dhamkee di thi
 The court stated that therefore, having sex without consent would be considered rape
 isi ke saath hai court ne munna ko doshi qaraar dene or 10 saal jail kii sajaa sunaane ke nichali adaalat ke saal 2015 ke faisle ko barkaraar rakhaa
 Munna was 28 years old at the time and he repeatedly raped a 19-year-old woman
 hai court ne apharan ke aparaadh main munna ko bari karne ke nichali adaalat ke faisle ko bhi barkaraar rakhte hue kaha ki mahila ke is bayaan ko lekaravisangatiyanhain ki vah kaise dilli pahunchin
 The woman had accused the accused of trying to push her into the sex trade business but the High Cart upheld the decision to acquit Munna and her co-accused partner Suman Kumar from this charge as well
 mahila ke anusaar, vah disambar 2010 main uttar pradesh se dilli ai thi or uski mulaakaat munna or uske saathi kumaar se hui jinhone use kaam dilaane kaa kathith taur par jhansa diya
 He alleged that Munna took him to Panipat in Haryana where he was kept locked in a flat for about two months and repeatedly raped
 mahila ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki use dhamkee di gai ki agar usne bhaagane kii koshish kii to use maar denge
 Later Munna took him to Kumar's flat in Noida and from there he took him to another flat in Shastri Park, Delhi
 mahila ne police ko yah bhi bataaya ki ek april 2011 ko jab kumaar ko pataa chalaa ki munna ne uski gairmaujuudagi main uske saath balaatkaar kiya he to donon ke bich ladaai hui or kumaar ne police ko phone kar diya

 The objective of this scheme was to control air pollution by reducing the number of vehicles on the road
 yojana kaa ulanghan karne waalon par 4,000 rupee jurmaana tha
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had earlier said that if the air quality in delhi-ncr remains very poor, then he can extend the life of the scheme
 lekin shuukravaar ko unhone kaha ki vah is mudde par somvaar ko vichaar karenge
 Talking to the media, he said that according to estimates, air quality is expected to increase in the coming days
 kejariwal ne kaha, "ham anaavashyak od-evan yojana thopanaa nahin chaahate
 We will look at air quality
 yadi isamen sudhaar hota he jo ham yojana kaa vistaar nahin karenge
 Otherwise, we will decide on its extension on Monday

 In this case, the officials of the Ministry of External Affairs involved in a conversation with the US sleepily proposed a proposal to Uttam Khobragade
 bharat main tab tadake teen baje kaa samay tha
 The proposal was that the US prosecutor's office remove serious charges of visa fraud and impose fines instead, as in the previous two cases involving Indian diplomats' maids
 khobragade ne america ke is prastaav ko sire se khaarij kar daalaa
 In an angry voice, he asked, "why should we give them any money?" After all, this matter is between two Indians
 ” aakhirkaar, uttam khobragade kii baat hi maani gai or unki beti agle 48 ghante ke bheetar laut ai
 It would be interesting to know how the situation would have been if Devayani's father had not struggled so much for his daughter to get justice
 Like Prabhu Dayal, the former Consul General of India in New York, Devyani had to pay a hefty $ 75,000 as a settlement or even worse that he would have to go to US prison
 uttam khobragade apni beti ko waapas laane ke liye dilli ke kasturba gandhi maarg par sthit maharashtra sadan main ek maah tak deraa daal baithe rahe
 Uttam Khobragade, a 1984 batch IAS officer, kept in touch with leaders of all opposition and opposition parties in Delhi from this location

 He was in constant touch with many mps, including UPA President Sonia Gandhi to BJP leaders Nitin Gadkari and Ram Vilas Paswan

 Uttam Khobragade's political ambition is no secret
 2012 man apni ritairement se pehle unhone rajyasabha kaa tikat paane ke liye kai dalon main lobying kii
 But could not succeed
 beti ke prakaran ne unki rajnatik mahatvakanksha ko ek baar phir hawa de di he
 They can contest the 2014 Lok Sabha elections

 The 41-year-old Phi Lip Richard, a driver at the US Embassy in New Delhi, flew to New York with his son Jatin, 18, and daughter Jennifer Su, 20
 uttam naaraazgi jaahir karte hue kehete hai, ''yah suniyojit sajeesh kaa aakhri kadam tha jisamen america sarkaar unhen america main nai jindagi thamane ke liye pli bargen (aparaadh dand sauda) ke jariye hamase hi rakam vasuulana chaah rahi thi
 "they want the foreign ministry to get Sangeeta's family on US diplomats to get air tickets under the diplomatic category and Rs 2,320
" ke airport tex kaa bhugtan nahin karne par dhokhadhadi kaa maamla daayar kare
 The State Department quickly discovered that Wayne, who helped the Richard family reach the United States in a hurry, is a special agent of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security at the US Embassy in Delhi
 sangeeta kaa pati richard philip wain me kaa driver tha
 When the US asked Devyani to leave the US, India, likewise, told Wayne the order to leave India in 48 hours

 High Commissioner in Islamabad parthasarathi kehete hai, ''us prakaran ke baad hamen duutavas main kam se kam ek siie adhikari ko to avaanchit qaraar dena chahie tha, par hamane aisa nahin kiya
 Apparently, this is the reason why America dared to behave with Devyani
 ”khobragade ko afsos he ki unhone naukaraani ko kaam par rakhane se pehle uske bare main puri jaankaree nahin lee
 At least he would have known that Phi Lip's parents worked as domestic help in the home of a senior American diplomat, and that the Richard family was living a life in America
 uttam kehete hai ki unhone phi lip ke dilli ke bank khate main har maheene 30,000 ru
 Transferred and paid the same amount in US dollars for Sangeeta's expenses in New York

 tej pratap ne nae bangale ko lekar di maheene pehle hi aavedan diya tha
 He said a few days ago that i spoke to the Bihar government minister about the new bungalow but i was not given any assurance
 bataa den ki beete kuch samay se lalu parivaar main sab kuch thik na hone kii baat saamne aa rahi he
 He was opposed in the family only after Tej Pratap applied for divorce from his wife
 parivaar ke andar chal rahi man-mutaav kaa asar saaf taur par baahar bhi dikhne laga tha
 a glimpse of this was also seen during the assembly session a few days ago
 jab tej pratap yadav satr ke dauraan apane chote bhai tejasvi yadav (tejashwi Yadav) or maa rabari devi (rabri Devi)se milane se bachate die

 He was in black slippers and had a U-shaped tilak on his forehead

 When Tejapratap Yadav came out after the house was adjourned, the reporters were bombarded with questions
 haalanki, tej pratap ne kai sawaalon ke jawaab to nahin die, magar nitish kumaar par hamalaa bolte hue kaha tha ki bihar main bavaal machaa hua he
 a very shocking case emerged in the capital of Madhya Pradesh, in which the family of Shaivamritaka was given to another family instead of another, especially that the family is not only separate but the two religions are also different
 bhopal memoriehospatalki laaparvaahee se ek isai vyakti kaa shavahindupariwaar ko de diya gaya jiskaa parivaar ne antim sanskaar bhi kar diya, lekinisai parivaarake aspataal pahunchane par aspataal kii laaparvaahee kii pole khuli
 After the matter came to light, the police remained in the police station till late night and the ashes of the dead person were lying in the police station waiting to go to the right heir
 yah he puraa maamalapulice ke mutabik 27 oktober ko bhopal ke govind garden nivasee kunjuman kii heart atake se maut ho gai thi jinke shav ko aspataal ke murdaghar main rakhaa gaya tha
 On the same day, the body of another person named Khushi Lal was brought to the morgue of the hospital
 kunjuman ke parijan shav kaa antim sanskaar 30 oktober ko karnaa chaahate the kyonki unke rishtedaar kerala main rahete hai jinke aane par hi aakhri rasmen hotin
 During this, Khushi Lal's sons reach the hospital and take the dead body to their home and perform the last rites of the dead body according to Hindu custom
 yahaan tak to sab thik lag rahaa tha, lekin kahani main mode tab aayaa jab kunjuman ke parivaar vaale somvaar ko shav lene aspataal pahunche
 On reaching the hospital, he saw that the corpse kept in the morgue was not that of Kunjuman but someone else
 duusare shav kii maang par khulaasiske baad jab aspataal main poochtacha kii to pataa chalaa ki ek hindu parivaar kunjuman kaa shav le gaya he jo ki bagamugalia main rahata he
 After this, when the family of Kunjuman reached Bagmugaliya, it was found that Kunjuman's dead body was cremated under Hindu customs
 iske baad maamla thane pahunch gaya orpulicene kunjuman ke shav ko apane pita kaa shav samaj kar antim sanskaar kar chuke beton ko thane bulavaa liya, lekin akele nahi balki kunjuman kii asthiyon ke saath
 Yes, Kunjuman's ashes attended late night at Nishatpura police station in Bhopal
 bhopal ke nishatpura thane main der raat asthiyon ke saath khusheelaal kaa betaa prem narayan or uskaa bhai pahunchaa
 If they believe, then the mistake is that of the hospital, who handed over the body of Kunjuman to them instead of Khushi Lal
 haalanki sawaal isliye khadey ho rahe hai ki hindu manyataon ke mutabik shav ko antim sanskaar se pehle kai rasmon ko puraa kiya jaataa he jisamen shav kaa cheharaa kai baar saamne padataa he aise main bete apane pita ke shav ko kyon nahin pahchaan paae
 Police filed the case When this matter came in front of the police, after investigation, a case was registered in the appropriate sections
 siespi lokesh kumaar ne bataaya ki ipisi kii dhara 297 ke tahat maamla darj kiya gaya he or asthiyon ko thane main bulawaaya gaya he taaki chrishchiyan parijan kam se kam asthiyaan le jaakar unki rasmon ko puraa kar saken
 On the other hand, a new screw came in the case late at night
 kunjuman ke bhai ke mutabik unke dharm ke anusaar asthiyon ko nahin balki puure shav ko dafnaaya jaataa he
 In such a situation, the family is unable to decide whether to take the ashes or leave the police station

 Vinod Khanna died on Thursday
 ve 70 saal ke the
 He was battling cancer for the last few days
 pichley dinon unki ek photo viral hui thi jisamen ve kaaphi aswasth dikh rahe the
 Vinod Khanna has done many brilliant films like 'mere Apne', 'qurbani', 'purab Aur Paschim', 'reshma Aur Shera', 'hath Ki Saafi', 'hera Pheri', 'mukaddar Ka Sikander'
 vinod khannaka naam aise actors main shumaar tha jinhone shuruyaat to villen ke kirdaar se kii thi lekin baad main hero ban gaye
 Vinod Khanna acted in the film 'hum Tum Aur Woh' in the solo lead role in 1971
 pehali film sin karne par pita hue the naaraaz1968 main vinod khanna ne jab sunil dutt kii home production film man kaa meet sin kii to unke pita kishan chand khanna behad naaraaz hue the
 His textile business then expanded from Bombay to Peshawar
 vinod khanna ko padhaa likhaakar ummid unhone ye kii thi ki bade hokar wo parivaar kaa bijness sanbhaalenge
 But Vinod came into the movies
 tab pita ne behad sakht andaaj main mohalat di thi ki agar tum filmein hi karnaa chaahate ho to jaao, tumhen 2 saal kii mohalat he
 If you are not able to do well there, then you have to manage the family business
 bantwaare main bikhar gaya tha khanna kaa parivarazadee ke baad jab desh ke do tukade hue tokhanna parivarpeshawar main jamaa jamaaya textiles kaa apana kaarobaar chhodkar mumbai aayaa
 Vinod Khanna did his early education at St
 Mary's and St
 Xavier's High School in Mumbai
 iske baad 1957 main khanna parivaar behatar kaarobaar ke lihaaj se dilli chalaa aayaa
 Vinod Khanna remained here for three years
 phir 1960 main parivaar waapas mumbai gaya, lekin behatar padhai likhaai ke lihaaj se mumbai ke paas devlali ke barns skool bhej diya gaya
 Vinod Khanna stayed in the school hostel till class 12 here
 lekin college kii padhai ke liye waapas mumbai gaye, tab yuva kad lathi or khubasurat rang rup ke saath sapane bhi badal chuke the
 Interested in acting with mughal-e-azamacting of acting, he was fond of boarding school days after watching movies like mughal-e-azam and Solan
 uske baad jab mumbai ke sidenhem college main aae, tab sapana tha pard likhakar ejeeniyar banane kaa
 But during that time, the amateur actress in dramas with beautiful complexion was making her famous
 isi bichvinod khannaki kuch dost ladakiyon ne unhen filmon main haath aajamaane ke liye uksaaya
 At that time, Vinod too felt that the relationship between the eyes of Mumbai and a city like Mumbai is still intact for this dream
 pehali film flop, phir bhi di rajesh-amitabh ko takkaris rup ke saath vinod khanna filmon main aae, to pehali film kii naakaami main bhi notice kiye gaye
 The tall stature and seductive style caught the attention of the makers
 filmein mili to us andaaj kii badaulat fain club bhi banate chale gaye
 After the star like Rajesh Khanna at that time, if there was any fan following, then it was Vinod Khanna
 us daur ke yuva ladke ladakiyon ke bich rajesh khanna kii lokapriyata ke baad baari vinod khanna kii hi aati thi
 Due to the same popularity, film directors like Manmohan Desai encouraged him to stand in front of a star like Amitabh
 ye 1974-75 kaa wo daur tha jab amitabh ke aage sabakaa sitara dhoomil pad chukaa tha
 At that time, only two were left in front of Vinod Khanna to remain in the world of cinema - fight Amitabh or flee from the world of cinema
 vinod khanna ne ye donon hi kiya
 Also a fierce fight with Amitabh and then a sudden escape away from the cinema screen

 Is Arvind Kejriwal afraid of falling the government? Or they are doing politics of pressure
 yah to saaf nahin he par unhone kuch aisa kah diya he jis par ek baar phir siyasat kaa garmaana tay he
 Arvind Kejriwal has expressed apprehension that Congress and BJP together can bring down his government
 unke paas sirf 48 ghante kaa vakt he isliye ve usee hisaab se kaam kar rahe hai
 Actually, today when Kejriwal was asked about the health, he said, 'what is the health? It keeps on recovering and deteriorating
 hamaare paas 48 ghante kaa vakt he kyonki bijepi or congress ke bich jo jod-tod chal rahi he usase pataa nahin ki sarkaar kab tak chalegi
 Therefore, we try to get as much work done by the public as possible within 48 hours
 'kejariwal ke is bayaan ko congress ne puri tarah se khaarij kar diya he
 Congress leader Shakeel Ahmed says that the Congress will further support the Aam Aadmi Party
 pataa nahin wo is tarah ke bayaan kyon de rahe hai
 Meanwhile, Arvind Kejriwal has also made it clear that MS Dhir will be the AAP candidate for the post of Delhi Assembly Speaker
 vidhansabha spikar pad ko lekar tej hui siyasataisa lagata he ki bataur mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kii agnipariksha kaa daur shuru ho gaya he

 agar wo is padaav ko paar kar le jate hai to agali hi seedhee par wo khud ko mushkil main ghira paa sakate hai or ye padaav hoga vidhansabha adhyaksh ke chunaav kaa
 LG had decided to make bjp's Jagdish Mukhi a pro-tem speaker and he would have administered the oath to all the members
 lekin bijepi ne kadaa faisla kiya ki mukhi yaa koi bijepi vidhayak pro tem spikar nahin banegaa
 In fact, due to the absence of a majority of the party, bjp's expectations have been raised
 agar mukhi pro tem spikar banate to vidhansabha adhyaksh chunaav main unka ek vot kam ho jaataa
 The party does not want to take such a risk
 bijepi ke 32 vidhayak hai or ek nirdaleey kaa samarthan usko mil saktaa he
 AAP has 28 mlas
 jadyu ke shoeb aap ko samarthan kar chuke hai
 In such a situation, the role of 8 members of Congress becomes important in the speaker election
 agar spikar AAP ko chhodkar kisi duusari party kaa banataa he to kya hoga? beshak spikar kaa pad partiyon kii raajnneeti se pare hota he lekin vidhansabha main khinchaai kii sambhaavna zyada hogi
 The voice of opposition can also be raised in a vocal manner
 ab dekhnaa ye hoga ki spikar kaa taj kis party ke sir sajata he

 It will also have a letter of support
 ''unhone kaha, ‘‘yadi rajyapal (mridula sinha) aashwast nahin hoti hai to unhen sarkaar banane ke liye akeli sabase badi party ko aamantrit karnaa hoga
 Former defense minister Parrikar was sworn in as Goa's chief minister after winning from Panaji in 2017
 parrikar ko vidhansabha pahunchane ke liye panaji vidhayak siddharth kuncolinkar ne 10 may 2017 ko istipha de diya jiske baad upachunaav hua

 anna hajaare ne pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko phir se patr likhakar kaha he ki is baat par andeh he ki lokapal vidheyak 23 disambar tak paarit ho paaegaa
 The Cold Session of Parliament is coming to an end on 23 December
 unhone chetavanee di he ki vidheyak paarit nahin hone par vah apana prastaavit anshan or ‘jail baro’ andolan shuru karenge
 In a four-page letter, he alleged that the government's behavior was 'not at all correct' and asked why Singh changed his stand on the Citizens 'charter (citizens' Charter) despite giving written assurances
 unhone aashwaasan diya tha ki naagarik adhikaar patr lokapal vidheyak kaa hissaa hoga
 He said that for the last few months, Singh had been giving letters to him through assurances that a strong Lokpal Bill would be passed in the winter session of Parliament
 hajaare ne kaha ki pichley ek varsh main sarkaar ne lokapal vidheyak par kaaphi aashwaasan diye lekin har baar unhone desh ke logon ke saath chal kiya
 He said that keeping in mind your points, we postponed all our movements till the winter session
 media main aa rahi khabaron ke mutabik sheet satr 23 disambar ko khatm hoga
 Will the Lokpal Bill be passed by then, we doubt it
 hajaare ne patr main likhaa he ki aapke vaadon ke baavjood sansad ke is satr main agar majboot, swatantra or prabhavi vidheyak paarit nahin hota, to 27 disambar se main anshan par baithne ko baadhya hounga
 Jail Bharo movement will start from 30 December
 sibiai kii bhrashtachar nirodhak shakha ko lokapal ke tahat laane kii maang karte hue unhone kaha ki lagata he ki koi bhi sarkaar raajnneetik kaarnon se sibiai par niyantran nahin chhodana chaahati
 On the misuse of the CBI, he said whether this meant that the Lokpal would not have an investigation agency
 bina jaanch agency ke yah kya karegi? isse acha he ki lokapal bane hi nahin
 Hazare said that he was surprised to see that the Union Cabinet approved a separate civil rights letter on 13 December, while Parliament has already passed a resolution that it would be under the Lokpal
 saamaajik kaaryakarta ne kaha ki aapane khud mujhe patr likhaa he or ab aap apana rukh kyon badal rahe hai or kehete hai ki ise sthaayee samiti ko bheja jayega
 It will take four months more
 aapako nahin lagata ki logon ke saath baar-baar thagi ho rahi he
 He also drew attention to the recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee which highlighted the shortcomings of the Lokpal's search and selection committee as leaders would play a major role in this
 hajaare ne aarope lagaaya ki sansad kii sthaayee samiti ke adhyaksh abhishek manusinghvi ne sadan dwaara paarit prastaavon par sangyaan nahin lekar sansad kaa apmaan kiya he
 He wrote in the letter that two of the three issues — the inclusion of lower bureaucracy, the Citizens' Charter and the Lokayukta in the states — were not accepted
 agar sthaayee samiti ke adhyaksh sansad ke prastaav kii upeksha karte hai, to hamaare loktantr kaa bhavishya kya hoga
 He said that the report of the Standing Committee (on Lokpal) is a fraud on the people of the country

 Amir (president) of jamaat-e-islami Hind, Maulana Syed Jalaluddin Umri said that about 40 lakh people from NRC list are suspected of being deprived of citizenship of India
 unhone kaha ki 1985 main assam samjhaute ke anusaar 24 march 1971 ke baad jis kisi ne bhi rajya main pravesh kiya he use avaidh naagarik mana jaataa he
 Applicants were obliged to provide evidence to enroll in the NRC
 lekin ve vaastavik naagarik jo garib, pichde yaa prakritik prakope ke kaaran apane dastavezon ko surakshit nahin rakh sake unke naam enarasi main darj hone se rah gaya he
 He said that most of those who could not join NRC were people who had minor errors in their documents
 sarkaar ko chahie ki vah enarasi adhikariyon ke bare main shikayaton par gaur karen, jinhone vishesh bhashaai samudaay ke khilaaf pakshpaat or bhedbhaav bartaa he
 He said that there have also been complaints that those officials, despite presenting inadequate documents, took the stand to cancel them
 tippaniyan Maulana Umri states that it is the government's job to provide sufficient time and opportunity to those whose names have been left out of the NRC list to provide necessary documents, remove discrepancies and complete procedures and formalities
 enarasi suchi main yah bhi visangatiyaan pain gayi hai ki bachche kaa naam to he, magar mata-pita kaa naam nahin he
 He said the second responsibility of the government is to keep a close watch on the law and order and prevent anti-social elements from mass violence and rioting against them by making the NRC list an issue and terming the minority community as foreigners, intruders and terrorists
 kuch mediakarmiyon kii bhoomika bhi asahyogpurn rahi he, kyonki unhone 40 lakh logon ke kilaaf abhaasi nafrat abhiyaan shuru kar diya he, jisase desh main sampradayik or fasivadi takaton ke ghrunit agendon ko madad mil rahi he

 But the four accused of hunting turtles and frogs - Damien Coleco, Natalo Fernandez, Lawrence Coleco and Santon Coleco - did not respond to his words because they do not understand Hindi
 ' Panaji's lockup is also used by the Forest Department as it does not have its own prison facility
 sutron ne kaha ki tejpal ne chaar kaidiyon se poocha ki ve kis aparaadh ke liye jail main band hai, lekin unhone tejpal ke chehre ko ghabrahat ke saath dekhte hue jawaab dene se manaa kar diya
 He said that Tejpal woke up twice a night to get water

 His family had brought a mattress for him but the Crime Branch officials refused, saying that the court orders do not allow it

 Says Wulfinger, who marries after 32, many times cannot find a worthy bride or groom

 ’ Describing the fears of privatization of the railways as baseless, the Central Government has said that some services are being outsourced on the initiative of the private sector to provide better services to the passengers in the train
 rail mantri piyush goyal ne shuukravaar ko rajyasabha main prashnkaal main ek sawaal ke jawaab main nijee kshetra ke sahyog kii vajah bataate huye kaha ki sarkaar ko railway ke kushal sanchaalan ke liye agle 12 saal main lagbhag 50 lakh karod rupee kii jarurat hogi
 It will not be possible for the government to raise this amount
 
 He said, "our intention is not to privatize the Indian Railways but to provide better facilities and benefits to the passengers
" bhartiya rail bharat or bharat ke logon kii sampada he or hameshaa rahegi
 Goyal said that in order to provide better facilities to passengers at trains and stations, the cooperation of the private sector is being outsourced on the basis of license system
 isse railway ke maujuuda karmchaariyon kii sevaayen kisi bhi prakaar se prabhavit nahin hongi
 In response to a supplementary question related to the progress of railway projects in Bihar, Minister of State for Railways Angadi Suresh said that 55 railway projects are underway in the state

 har roj unase milane ke liye 300-400 kaaryakarta pahunchate hai, lekin haal hi main unke 53wein janmdin ke maukey par yah sankhya paanch hajaar ke kareeb pahunch gai
 Hoardings were hanged in many places including the BJP office in Delhi
 utsahit kaaryakartaaon ne 53 kilo kaa vishesh laddu banavaakar baanta
 But Sanjay Joshi, who was once the general secretary of bjp's powerful organization, could hardly have realized that this enthusiasm is passing on to someone
 joshi ko janmdin ke badhai sandesh vaale hordings lagane ke liye kendriya swasthya rajyamantri shripad yesso nik ke tatkaaleen atirikt nijee sahaayak nitin saradaare ko naukari se haath dhonaa padaa
 BJP national president Amit Shah took strong note of this and the company making the poster was summoned and questioned
 party ke ek netaa kaa kahana he, "saradaare ne shararthpurna ravaiya apanaaya, isliye shah ne shripad ko phone kar fatkaaraa
 "the BJP has prepared a list of 125 people who congratulate Joshi, who may not be immediately taken action like Sardare, but a strategy has been made to deprive them of responsibility in future
 bijepi ke is tevar se sawaal uthta he ki aakhir joshi kii shakhsiyat main aisa kya he jinhen saamaanya shishtachar ke tahat agar koi bijepi kaaryakarta janmdin kii badhai bhi detaa he, to satta or sanghathan main baithe bijepi ke sheersh netritv ke kaan khadey ho jate hai
 Who is Sanjay born in Joshinagpur and grew up there, Sanjay Joshi took a mechanical engineering degree from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology
 phir usee santhaan main ve 6 saal tak lekturer rahe or purnakalik prachaarak banane ke liye naukari chhod di
 First in Gujarat and then in 2001, he held the chair of bjp's youngest national organization minister at the age of 38
 saadhaaran pajama or kurta pahanane vaale 53 varshiya joshi kii santhnik kaaryastylee kii visheshta unki sahajata rahi he
 However, at the 2005 BJP session in Mumbai, where Advani bid farewell, Joshi's alleged sex CD pushed him into politics too
 baad main police jaanch main unhen clin chit mil gai
 Except for a few months as Nitin Gadkari's president, Joshi has been out of the mainstream of BJP for a decade
 ve party main kisi pad par nahin hai or pradhanmantri narendra modi se unke rishton kii kadavaahat jagajaahir he, phir bhi unase rojaanaa milane vaale kaaryakartaaon kii sankhya bijepi ke kisi bhi netaa se milane waalon se zyada rahati he
 In a conversation with India Today, Joshi refrains from speaking on controversial issues, but says on the strategy ahead, "I am committed to serving the party and the country, so i go to events organized by the party and activists
" " poster masale par unka kahana he, "isamen koi andeh nahin ki modi ji hamaare netaa hai
 i am satisfied with my role
 "modi or joshi main adaavat kyunsang ne joshi ko gujarat main modi ke saath lagaaya
 The duo established the roots of the party, and in 1990 the BJP came to the point that the Janata Dal needed it to form the government
 1995 main keshubhai patel ke netritv main bijepi kii sarkaar ban gai
 From here, the direction of the politics of Gujarat changed, so there was a bit of bitterness in the relationship between modi-joshi, the campaigners of the Sangh
 modi ko usee saal bijepi kaa rashtriya mantri banaakar himachal pradesh-haryana kaa prabharee banaaya gaya
 But their center was kept in Chandigarh instead of Delhi
 modi ko laga ki iske peeche joshi kaa haath he
 After 2005, both of them neither encountered each other nor had a phone conversation
 jab gadakari ne unhen dobaaraa party main laakar kaarysmiti sadsy or upi kaa sanyojak banaaya to modi chunaav prachaar main nahin gaye
 After all, on 24 May 2012, he forced the party to remove Joshi from the Working Committee
 taaja masalaa poster vivaad kaa he
 The way action was taken on those who congratulated Joshi, it is clear that Joshi's return to the mainstream of BJP under Modi's leadership is impossible
 aakhir is karrwai kii vajah dushmani he yaa bhay? joshi samarthak ise doharaa maapdand bataa rahe hai
 He says that Modi talks about 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas', but why treat Joshi like this? Supporters say that in Joshi's case, Shah is only an instrument and the real game is being played by Modi
 sutron kaa daawa he ki shah or joshi ke bich sampark rahata he, lekin bijepi ke netaa ise sire se khaarij karte hai
 Joshi's supporters raise the question that Modi himself goes to the wedding ceremony of the Mulayam Singh who fired on the kar sevaks
 jin lalu yadav ne adwani kii rath yatra roki vahaan bhi modi jate hai
 Sharad Pawar, who calls the Sangh a terrorist organization, shares the stage with him in Baramati, the Mufti hugs Mohammad Saeed with affinity, but why avoid Joshi? However, BJP national secretary Shyam Jaju says, "sardare did not become an assistant to Shripad Naik through the process of organization, so the organization has no role in it
 "khamosh kyon hai sangh'sajay' par ho rahe mahabharat main aakhir sangrakshak kii bhoomika nibhaane vaala sangh khamosh kyon he? janvari main ahmedabad main sangh kaaryakarta shivi kaa aayojan hua to joshi bhi aamantrit the
 But sources say that to prevent Joshi from attending the meeting, the top leadership of BJP had approached the union officials of the state themselves
 sangh ke akhil bhartiya prachaar pramukh manmohan vaidya india today se kehete hai, "joshi hameshaa sangh kaa hissaa rahe hai or sangh unke liye ghar jaisaa hi he
 "but a former pracharak of the Sangh, who has played an important role in the BJP, says on the silence of the Sangh," The Sangh always stands with the power after the party comes to power and gets so involved that it lacks the ability to resolve
 She goes
 " poster vivaad par unka maananaa he ki kuch log yah samajhate honge ki raajnneeti main kisi ko sirf ghayal karke nahin chhodia chahie
 But Shyam considers Jaju Joshi's responsibility to be an issue of the Sangh
 jabaki vaidya kehete hai, "modi-joshi prachaarak nahin ab sirf swayamsevak hai or joshi kii jimmedaari yaa poster vivaad ke bare main party se poocha janaa chahie
 "despite being at the helm of the modi-shah duo, Joshi's ability to make both of them uncomfortable both inside and outside the party is a reflection of his personality's grit
 darasal, tharur ne ravivaar ko ek kaarykram ke dauraan kaha ki koi bhi acha hindu ye nahin chahega ki ek dharmik sthal ko giraakar ram mandir bane
 After the ruckus on the statement, Tharoor tweeted, "my statement was misrepresented
" maine sirf yah kaha tha ki bahut se hindu isliye vahaan par mandir chaahate hai, kyonki vahaan par shriram kii janmabhumi he
 But a good Hindu would not want a temple to be built in a place where someone else's religious site was demolished
