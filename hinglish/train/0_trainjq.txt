 However he said that this is his personal opinion
 lekin rahul gandhi main desh ko aage le jane kii kshamta he

 Outside the court, only a method of compromise has to be found

 The importance of Sun worship and its benefits are also found in mythological stories
 mana gaya he ki surya ko roj jal chadhaane se swasthya thik rahata he or ghar main sampannataa aati he
 According to the legend, according to the legend of Mahabharata, Karna worshiped the sun regularly and offered water to the sun
 surya kii puja ke bare main bhagwaan ram kii bhi katha milti he ki vah bhi har din surya ko jal dekar unki puja karte the
 It is also said in the scriptures that one should give water to the sun every day and many people also follow this rule
 surya bhagwaan kii krupa paane ke liye karen ravivaar kaa vrath
 
 
 Come, know the benefits of giving water to the sun
 
 
 1
 In Jyoti Shastra, Sun is described as a factor of soul
 isliye aatm shuddhi or aatmbal badhaane ke liye niyamit rup se surya ko jal dena chahie
 2
 surya ko niyamit jal dene se sharir urjavan banataa he or kaaryakshetra main iskaa laabh miltaa he
 3
 agar aapaki naukari main pareshaani ho rahi he to niyamit rup se surya ko jal dene se ucchadhikariyon se sahyog milane lagata he or mushkilen dur ho jaati hai
 4
 surya ko jal dene ke liye tambe ke paatr kaa upyog karnaa behatar rahata he
 5
 surya ko jal dene se pehle jal main chutki bhar roli milaayein or laal phool ke saath jal den
 After this, give water 7 times while giving water and chant the mantra of sun

 The newly appointed General Secretary of the Congress, Priyanka Gandhi, has made a big bet from seven seas
 sutron ke mutabik priyanka ne america se hi uttar pradesh ke congress ke ek darjan netaaon ko phone karke unka aashirwad, sahyog or maargdarshan maanga he
 Let us know that Priyanka is in America these days for the treatment of her daughter
 dilachasp he ki ye ek darjan ke kareeb netaa ab yaa to rajnatik taur par haashiye par hai yaa phir umr ke antim padaav main hai or party main hi alag-thalag pade hai
 The special thing is that some of these people do not even belong to any party in today's era
 priyanka ne inako phone kar siyaasi badppan dikhaane kii koshish to kii hi he, saath hi zyada se zyaada logon ko jodne kii kavayad bhi kii he
 Priyanka also knows that she can create a strong hold among the public only by zealously activists and leaders

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi made a big bet before the Lok Sabha elections by bringing his sister Priyanka into active politics
 unhone priyanka ko purvi uttar pradesh kaa prabhaar diya
 Priyanka's arrival in Uttar Pradesh's politics is like any Sanjeevani for the workers, but whether or not her magic will work, only the people of the state will tell

 In such a situation, Priyanka is ready to challenge the new generation as well as the leaders who have seen the golden age of Congress in UP
 iske jariye priyanka ek tir se do nishane sadhana chaahati hai
 One can take advantage of the experience of the old leaders and the other can bring the golden age of Congress alive among the new generation of people
 khayr parde ke peeche se daanv chal raheen priyanka kii asal chunauti siyaasi dharaatal par hogi, jahaan pataa chalegaa ki unke ye daanv tir hai yaa mahaj tukka

 Therefore, it is not appropriate for him to sit on the dais with PM Modi and Union Minister m Venkaiah Naidu a few days before this announcement of candidature
 iske alaava piem modi khud yah chaahate honge ki aise vyakti se saarvajanik str par duuri banaae rakhen, jise endie raashtrapati candidet ke rup main aage badhanaa chaahati he
 Sources also say that Sreedharan himself did not object to it because he has been told about it
 ab dekhnaa yah hoga ki agar vastav membijapi ne raashtrapati ke liye shridharanka naam aage kiya to iske baad vipakshi dal kya ranneeti apanaayenge, kyonki unke liye shridharan kaa virodh karnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 According to reports, the Kerala government sent a list of 17 people who were to sit on the dais with PM Modi to the PMO
 isamen shridharan kaa naam shaamil tha
 Apart from this, the names of Leader of Opposition in Kerala Ramesh Chennithala, former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, local MLA PT Thomas Chennithala and Chief Secretary Nalin Netto were also included

 in donon kii saajhedaari ke dauraan team jeet kii ore badhati dikh rahi thi
 However, when Vijay was heading towards his first half-century in the series, he waved the ball outside Rampal off-stump in the leg side and Bishoo dived and caught his best catch
 unhone 78 gend kii apni pari main chaar chauke maare
 Dhoni brought Suresh Raina (08) to bat at number four to speed up the run pace but Rampal soon ended his innings
 iske baad lakshmana ke maidan par utarane ke saath tay ho gaya ki bharat test dra karke shrinkhalaa jeetne main bhi khush he
 Earlier, Harbhajan Singh took four wickets for 75 runs from India
 suresh raina ne 32 jabaki praveen kumaar ne 44 ran dekar do do wicket hasil kiye
 West Indies captain Darren Sammy (17), who got ahead by 224 runs for six wickets, hit two fours against Ishant Sharma in the first over of the day
 chandrapal or saimi kii jodi haalanki iske baad vishwasaneey shaat nahin khel pai
 The 10th over of the day was unfortunate for the West Indies with the team getting a double blow
 harbhajan ne pehle saimi ko short leg par abhinav mukund ke haathon kaich haraaya jabaki do gend baad ravi rampal bhi ran out hokar pavilion laut gayi
 In TV replays, however, it was felt that the ball did not hit Sammy's bat while Rampal's bails fell from Dhoni's gloves
 chandrapal ne iske baad fidel edwards nauven wicket ke liye ahm saajhedaari karke team kii badhat ko 150 ran ke paar pahunchaaya
 The left-handed batsman, meanwhile, scored two runs off Ishant Sharma with the help of five fours in 265 balls to complete his 23rd career century and his sixth Test century against India
 chandrapal or fidel edwards ne lunch ke baad ke satr main bhi bhartiya gendbaajon ko ek ghante se adhik samay tak wicket se maharoom rakhaa
 In the meantime, Fidel Edwards' dhriya left him and he managed to pick up the handy bowler Raina and hit an easy catch to Praveen Kumar at long-off
 unhone 106 kaa saamana karte hue do chauke jade

 2019 loksabhaa chunaavon kaa shor ab thanda padataa dikhaai de rahaa he
 Once again, young India has elected aged leaders to rule
 1999 se lekar 2019 tak ke chunaavon kii india today data intelligence unit (DIU) ne saansadon kii aayu ke aankadon kaa aankalan kiya or pataa lagaaya ki pichley bees saal se hamaare saansadon kii umr 50 saal se upar hi rahi he
 It is worth noting that more than half of India's population is under 28 years
 DIU ne haal hi main chune gaye saansadon kii umr kaa aankalan kiya to yah saafe ho gaya ki desh kii aabaadi jawan hoti ja rahi he lekin desh ke netaa nahin
 The 2011 Census figures show that 11 percent of India's population is aged 25‚Äì30 years
 17veen lok sabha ke paas is umr ke keval 1
 5 percent are mps
 aankade yah bhi bataate hai ki 25 pratishat se zyaada kii aabaadi 25-40 kii aayu seemaa main aate hai lekin 17veen lok sabha main is umr ke mahaj 12 pratishat saansad hi hai
 As we move upwards in the population pyramid, we find that as age ranges increase, the number of mps of that age also increases
 iskaa matlab he ki badi umr ke saansadon kii sankhya kam umr ke saansadon kii sankhya se zyaada he
 This time the highest number of mps were elected from 51-55 years old
 16 pratishat se zyaada saansad is aayu seemaa main padate hai
 Increasing number of old mps: Increasing number of old mps The number of aged mps has also been steadily increasing in the last twenty years
 13veen lok sabha (1999-2004) main saansadon kii ausat aayu lagbhag 52 varsh thi
 When India was moving towards a new century, the average age of its mps was the lowest
 2004 main bhi bharat ke saansadon kii ausat aayu 52 varsh rahi
 This average age increased to 54 in 2009
 2014 main saansadon kii ausat aayu charam badhkar 59 saal ho gai
 This trend of increasing the average age of mps lasted for three consecutive elections and it declined in 2019, the average age in the last Lok Sabha was reduced to 55 years
 lekin yah ausat ab bhi 1999-2009 kii tulana main zyaada he
 Congress is indeed Grand Old Party DIU had examined the candidates' figures before the election was over and it was found that this time the veteran parties did not give opportunity to the youth
 bhartiya janata party ke sirf 8 pratishat ummidavaar 40 se kam kii aayu ke the
 The average age of BJP mps was 55 years
 bijepi ke sabase zyaada ummidavaar jite hambhajapa ke baad, desh kii duusari sabase badi party congress ne bhi kuch zyaada achche vikalp nahin die
 Estimates of old figures show that the Congress is indeed a 'grand Old Party'
 1999 se lekar 2019 tak, sabhi lok sabhaaon main congress party ke saansadon kii ausat aayu bhaajapa se zyaada rahi he
 In 1999, where the average age of BJP mps was 49
 7 varsh thi, vahiin congress ke saansadon kii ausat aayu 54
 Was 8 years old
 2004 main congress saansadon kii ausat aayu badhkar 56 varsh ho gai
 The age of BJP mps increased to 51 years
 2009 main congress saansadon kii aayu ghatakar 55
 It has been 3 years
 lekin uske baavjood vah bhaajapa kii 54 varsh kii ausat se upar hi rahi
 The average age of mps of both the Congress and BJP in 2014 was the highest
 jahaan congress saansadon kii ausat aayu 64 varsh thi, vahiin bhaajapa saansadon kii ausat 60 saal thi
 By the year 2019, the average age of the mps of both the parties has come down to 57 (congress) and 55 (BJP) years, so it can be clearly said that all the parties have remained in giving tickets to the youth

 There was disappointment among the international supporters of Nobel laureate Aung Sang Suu Kyi who remained silent on the ongoing communal violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state
 unhone kaha ki muslim or buddha samudaay donon hi is baat se ‚Äòasantusht‚Äô hai ki vah kisi kaa paksh nahin le rahi hai
 One lakh people have been displaced in this violence that raged in the state since last June
 yahaan par pichley maheene bhadki taaja hinsa main 30 hajaar log palaayan kar gayi hai
 a large number of people have died in this violence and thousands of houses have been burnt
 tippaniyan Aung Song said on Saturday, "I am appealing for tolerance but one should not use one's moral leadership
" ‚Äô‚Äô After speaking to Jos√© Manuel Burroso, the chairman of the European Commission in the capital Naypyidou, Aung Song said she could not say anything in support of the state Rohingya Muslims
 unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòmain jaanati hum ki log chaahate hai ki main kisi ek paksh kaa samarthan karun, isiilie donon hi paksh mujhase asantusht hai kyonki main unke saath ek paksh nahin luungi
 "it is noteworthy that eight million Rohingya Muslims living in Myanmar are considered by the government here and many illegal immigrants from Bangladesh
 nobel puraskaar vijeta ang sang su chi ke myama ke rakhin rajya main chal rahi sampradayik hinsa par chuppi saadhe rahane par unke antarrashtriya samarthakon main ise lekar niraashaa thi
 She said that both the Muslim and Buddhist communities are 'dissatisfied' with the fact that she is not taking sides
 rajya main gat june maheene se bhadki is hinsa main ek lakh log visthapit ho chuke hai
 Here, 30,000 people have escaped in the latest violence erupted last month
 is hinsa main badi sankhya main log maare gaye hai or hajaaron ghar jal gaye hai
 The comments ang sang ne shanivaar ko kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòmain sahishnutaa baratane kii apil kar rahi hum lekin kisi ko kisi ke naitik netritv kaa istemaal nahin karnaa chahie

 !! # pinkylalwani # vijaymallyaa post shared by Bollywood Current Insta (@bollywoodcurrent_insta) on Mar 28, 2018 at 5:49am PDT Due to the severe erosion of the Kosi river, which is called the mourning of Bihar, a village in Alamnagar block in Madhepura district is on the verge of disappearing and the villagers fear that the whole village will be covered in the river this year
 alamnagar prakhand ke ratvaara panchayat kaa murout gaanv kabhi khushhaal gaanv tha, lekin beete 10 varsh ke dauraan lagaataar bheeshan kataav ke kaaran kosi nadi ne kareeb kareeb ise apane agosh main le liya he
 Poonam Devi, the head of Ratwara Gram Panchayat, says that due to the severe erosion this year, it seems that the Kosi river will swallow the entire village
 graminon kii kareeb 100 acre upjau jameen, ek madhya vidhyalay or shiv mandir pehle hi nadi main samaa chukaa he
 The people of Murout village, with a population of about five thousand, are leaving everything and living on a roadside temporary shelter on Alamnagar Murout Road
 kareeb 10 gharon ke log majaburi main or lagaav ke kaaran gaanv main jame hue hai, lekin ve bhi jald ashiana chhodkar chale jaayenge
 Local MLA and state Planning and Development Minister Narendra Narayan Yadav says that people trapped in this situation will be given help to settle
 adhikariyon ke anusaar, gaanv main kataav rokane ke liye 10 varsh ke dauraan kataav nirodhak kaary ke liye kareeb 11 karod rupee kharch kar diye gayi, lekin nateeja kuch bhi nahin niklaa he
 According to District Magistrate Upendra Kumar, the situation is being monitored
 prabhavit graminon ko niyamaanukool muaavja diya jayega
 Kumar also went to the village and talked to the people and assured them of help
 apni jameen se naata tuutane ke kaaran gaanv ke logon kii aarthik sthiti dayaneey ho gayi he
 Some people are helpless due to losing their land
 aarthik rup se sakasham kuch logon ne apane ashiyane bana liye hai
 Ashutosh Sharma of the village says that those who had qualified members in the house have gone out in search of work
 kuch log mazdooree kar apana guzar basar karte hai
 Ashok Das says that people who had cattle
 ve doodh kaa vyavsaay kar thodi bahut kamai kar lete hai, lekin parivaar chalaanaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 The situation in some other villages is also bad due to erosion of Kosi in Madhepura
 chausa prakhand kaa munaut gaanv, alamnagar prakhand ke chhatuna basa, kapasia, sukhadghat gaanv kii kareeb 10 hajaar aabaadi kii bhi apni-apni kahani he or dard he
 Until one and a half years ago, the return of the ticket of the party whose ticket was considered to be a guarantee of victory in the assembly elections, before the Lok Sabha elections, cannot be said to be a good sign for the political health of the Samajwadi Party
 halaat yah he ki pashchimi upi main sompaal shastri or purvi upi main saansad brijabhooshan sharan singh ne to party kaa tikat lautaaya hi he, party ko ab tak ghoshit 16 ummidavaar badalane pade hai
 In fact, ever since the BJP has made Narendra Modi its prime ministerial candidate, since then the party has suddenly been seen active in Uttar Pradesh
 sutron kii maane to sapa ke alaava baaki partiyon ke bhi kareeb 38 saansad bijepi se tikat paane kii jugat main lage hue hai
 On the other hand, the Congress believes that in the presence of Modi in national politics, Muslims will prefer him instead of SP
 sapa ko ab tak ummid thi ki vidhansabha main mili (kareeb 20 fisadi) muslim matadaataaon kaa samarthan use loksabhaa main bhi milegaa
 But the politics behind the scenes came to the surface after the Muzaffarnagar riots
 brijabhooshan sharan singh ne party kaa tikat lautaate hue kaha, ''upi main 1947 se bure halaat ho gaye hai
 If the SP government says that all this has been done by the BJP, then the question is whether the people had brought the SP to power so that Akhilesh Sarkar should be sitting hand in hand
 ‚Äù darasal brijabhooshan pehle bhi bijepi main rahe hai or jab unhen laga ki sapa ke sitare kahin gardish main na chale jaaen, isliye unhone mauka dekhakar party kaa tikat thukraa diya
 Sompal Shastri rejected another strong ticket by rejecting a party ticket in western UP in 1998, defeating Ajit Singh, a powerful Jat leader and Union Civil Aviation Minister in the Lok Sabha elections from Baghpat
 shastri kii sabase badi chintaa yah rahi ki mujffarnagar dangon ne pashchimi upi kii hameshaa se chali aa rahi jat-muslim ekta main daraar daal di
 There is a lot of resentment against the SP government over the riots in the Jats of the area, the Muslims are also not happy
 aise main paaramparik vot ko bachaae rakhane ke liye sapa ko chhodia shastri ko samajhdaari bharaa vikalp laga
 Sastri says, "the top SP leaders are getting away from the grassroots activists, in such situations it is not possible to stay connected with the party
" ‚Äù badalte samikarnon ko saadhane ke liye hi sapa ne saharanpur ke muslim netaa rashid masood ke bhattije imran masood ko party main shaamil kar unhen saharanpur loksabhaa kshetra se purv ghoshit pratyaashee firoz aftab kii jagah nayaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya
 Why is there a stampede in SP? State spokesperson of the party Rajendra Chaudhary argues, "shastri and Brij Bhushan Singh did not return the ticket but the party had already informed them that their ticket was being cut
" ‚Äù unke mutabik, ab tak 16 loksabhaa ummidavaaron ke tikat cat chuke hai or or aage bhi kaate ja sakate hai
 They reject the impact of Narendra Modi
 sattadhari dal ke tikat ko lekar netaaon kii aisi berukhi sapa kii bechaini ko badha rahi he
 After East and West, the party is also in trouble in Bundelkhand
 party ke paas yahaan kii chaar main se do loksabhaa siten thim, lekin donon vartmaan saansadon ke tikat kaatane pade
 The latest ticket that the party has cut is that of Ghanshyam Anuragi, MP from Jalaun (reserved) Lok Sabha seat
 jalon ke hi paas banda seat se party ne jab saansad aar
 K
 singh patel kaa tikat kaata to unhone basapa kaa daaman pakadaaey main jaraa bhi der nahin kii
 On the other hand, by cutting the ticket of its sitting MP Radhemohan Singh from Ghazipur, the SP has placed bets on Kushwaha votes by removing Shivakanya Kushwaha, wife of Babu Singh Kushwaha, who is jailed as the main accused of NRHM scam
 sapa ke rashtriya mahasachiv naresh agarwal kii daleel he, ''upi kaa musalmaan acchhee tarah se jaanata he ki unka jitna hit mulaayam singh kar sakate hai, utana to koi doosraa netaa soch bhi nahin saktaa
 "but in spite of this argument one cannot hide the fact that after the Muzaffarnagar riots, the party's biggest Muslim face, Mohammad Azam Khan, openly expressed public displeasure
 is bich ati pichhadaa matadaataaon ko jodgaye ke liye sapa ne nai kavayad shuru kii he
 The SP is running two rath yatras in the state
 iskaa makasad 17 ati pichhadi jatiyon ko anusuchit jati kii suchi main daalane ke paksh main abhiyaan chalaakar mayawati ke janaadhar ko kamjor karnaa he
 Before embarking on the Lok Sabha elections, the party will have to think whether Mulayam Singh Yadav will be in a position to hold rallies like Modi and Rahul Gandhi? And will Akhilesh be able to become his leader by heart among the party's cadres by then? Despite being at the peak of power, the SP, which is getting entangled in its own roots, has to look into itself whether it really has any strategy for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections or not? dangal ke baadamir khaalpani agali film thags of hindustaan main najar aaenge

 Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara said on Friday that India has presented themselves as the strongest contenders for the title despite some embarrassing defeats in the league stage and now their team has to avoid losing to them for the second consecutive finals
 Must perform special
 sangakaara ne match kii purv sandhya par samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, ‚Äòbharat ab final ke liye puri tarah taiyaar dikhataa he or usne kai avasaron par hamen karaari shikast di he
 Questions are being asked about the toss whether the team winning the toss will be in advantage
 mujhe aisa nahin lagata
 He said, "if a team consistently wins, you should give it credit
 iskaa matlab yah he ki vah aisi paristhitiyon kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar he
 We have played the finals many times and we have to do a very special performance to win tomorrow
 ‚Äô bharat pehle match main newjiland se 200 ran se haar gaya tha jabaki srilanka ke khilaaf aath wicket kii paraajay main vah 103 ran par dher ho gaya tha
 The figures are however in favor of India, which won the title by defeating Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup final in June
 sangakaara ne kaha ki unki team ne bharat or newjiland ke bich antim lig match dekha tha
 He said, 'india performed very well
 unhone paristhitiyon kaa phayda uthaaya or newjiland par dabaav banane main safal rahe
 We saw that match and when we get on the field, we will take care of everything like how they bowled, how their line was and how their bowlers handled the attack
 ' Like all the other babas of the country, Dati Maharaj has disappeared for fear of arrest
 gaayab isliye kyonki somvaar ko unhen dilli kii krime branch ke saamne haazir hona tha
 But instead of coming himself, he sent his lawyer
 poochtacha se bachate daati maharaj kii is harakat ke baad krime branch ne unhen sirf buudhvaar tak kii mohalat di he
 And if Dati does not appear before the Crime Branch till Wednesday, a non-bailable warrant will be issued against him
 gaayab ho gaye daati maharaajadati maharajane ajtak ke camere par kaha tha ki wo somvaar ko police ke saamne pesh ho honge
 But Daati Maharaj disappeared by promising
 ab krime branch kaa intazaar or lanbaa ho gaya
 In fact, through a lawyer, Dati has sought an extension from the police
 haalanki police ne unke khilaaf gair jamaanti warrant jari karne kii chetavanee bhi di he
 Now the question is arising whether Dati Maharaj will come before the police after two days? Non-bailable warrant may be issued
 On the camera of the accused, Dati Maharaj had both claimed and promised that he would appear before the crime branch on Monday
 magar somvaar ko puure din baba kii koi bhanak hi nahin lagi
 On the contrary, Dati sent his lawyer to the Crime Branch office in Delhi
 lekin krime branch ne unke vakil ko do took jawaab de diya he ki rape ke is maamle main agar daati maharaj buudhvaar tak haazir nahin hote hai to unke khilaaf gaiyr jamaanti warrant jari kar diya jayega
 Datiyani Maharaj, a rape accused who has gone missing for fear of arrest, finds himself clean and law-abiding, is now missing to escape arrest
 police daati maharaj ke thikaanon par chhapemari kar rahi he
 The new twist to the whole affair is that instead of appearing in the crime branch, Dati Maharaj released an audio clip
 haalanki is clip main daati maharaj ne apane samarthakon se shanti banaae rakhane kii apil kii he
 In the appeal audio by releasing the audio clip, Dati said, "I am a fakir, if you love me in the slightest then you will not hold any such meeting in my name
 doodh kaa doodh or pani kaa pani nyaay karata he, main nyaay main vishwaas karata hum
 i request you to fold your hand that my case will be turned upside down, if you do any such work
 main haath jodakar aapse vinamr vinati karata hum ki is tarah kaa koi kaam mat karnaa
 Just pray that the truth which i have walked on, be successful and be justice
 kisi tarah kaa dharna-pradarshan or kisi tarah kii koi meeting yaa kisi tarah kii koi bayaanbaji rashtrahit main thik nahin he
 The nation is neither ST nor SC, nor is it gold
 raashtra sirf raashtra hota he or raashtra se bada koi nahin hota he
 "the lawyer asked to appear
 After this audio clip comes out, the question arises that if Dati Maharaj, who talks about the nation and the law, is innocent, then why are he not appearing before the crime branch
 is bich kehane vaale ye kah rahe hai ki chunki daati maharaj khud astrologer he or wo in dinon grahon kii badalati chaal ko dekhte hue 19 taarikh tak giraftaar nahin hona chaahate hai
 Therefore, his lawyer has sought time from Crime Branch till Wednesday i

 Now she has been looking for him here and there, with a search warrant
 guruuvar ko ajtak ko intervyuu dene ke baad ravivaar ko phir hamane unase phone par kii
 In which Dati Maharaj himself claimed that he has not run anywhere
 to phir sawaal ye he ki akhir police un kyon pahunch nahin paa rahi he
 Accused of raping the disciple, Maharaj was accused of raping his own pupil and the victim lodged the case against Dati on 10 June at Fatehpur Beri police station in Delhi
 tab se police daati ke khilaaf saboot jutaney ke liye peedita ke saath uske ashramon main chaanbin kar rahi he
 The victim alleges that Dati Maharaj raped her in Delhi's ashram two years ago and then raped her in Pali's Alavas ashram
 chaanbin ke dauraan peedita ne police ko wo kamare bhi dikhaae, jahaan usase jyaadati kii gai thi
 The victim lived in this ashram

 Today swords are drawn between Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi and former Health Minister Tej Pratap Yadav regarding Health Minister Mangal Pandey
 tej pratap yadav ne mangal pandey kaa nayaa namakaran karke unhen amangal pandey kahana shuru kar diya he
 It is because of this that Mangal Pandey had been missing from Bihar for the past few weeks and was migrating to Himachal Pradesh

 What Mangal Pandey went missing from Bihar for a few weeks was that former Health Minister Tej Pratap Yadav started calling him a minister of promenade and renamed him "amangal Pandey"
 tej pratap yadav ne aarope lagaaya ki bihar main swasthya sevaayen charmara rahi thi or mangal pandey himachal pradesh main saiyr sapata karne main vyast the

 Tejapratap Yadav wrote that "amangal Pandey ji" is a minister who visits Himachal Pradesh
 tej pratap yadav ke aisi hamale kaa jawaab shaam hote-hote upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne bhi diya
 Sushil Modi said that people like Tej Pratap Yadav have become disheartened since he came to power and are embarrassing the state by bringing political debate to a very poor and personal level
 tej pratap ko lekar modi ne kaha ki unke paas naa koi thos tark he, naa tathy or naa unhen bhashaa kii maryaada hi sikhaai gai he
 Modi said that Tej Pratap Yadav never got free time from the Jalebi filtering and playing the flute while he was the health minister

 dwadash jyotirlingon main sirf ujjain main hi tadake chaar baje bhasmarti hoti he jiske liye upale kii raakh taiyaar kii jaati he
 After the points of the system were made public in the Supreme Court, scholarly debate also started
 mashhoor jyotirvid pan
 Anandashankar Vyas says, "changes in the Puja method of Mahakal are not unanimous, a change in the ancient worship tradition of the temple can be done only after consultation with the Shankaracharyas
 " vahiin sarika guru kaa tark he ki dooshit jal tathaa panchamrita se shivlinga ko nuksaan pahunch rahaa he
 Some measures have also been taken in other Jyotirlingas to protect Shivling from erosion
 kedarnath, mallikarjun, bhimashankar, ghrishneshwar, somnath, omkareshwar or trayambakeshwar main darshanathiyon ke shivlinga par panchamrita chadhaane par roak he
 Jyotirlinga is covered with silver armor at Nageshwar and Bhimashankar while devotees are prohibited from entering the sanctum sanctorum at Rameswaram and Somnath
 kaashi vishwanath main jyotilag ko sparsh nahin kiya ja saktaa par desh ke 12 jyotirlingon main se sirf ujjain ke mahakaal kaa jalabhishek ''aaro water" se hoga
 This will be made available from the RO plant of the temple itself
 ab tak mandir parisar ke kotitirth main jamaa jal se mahakaal kaa jalabhishek hota tha
 a committee of experts was constituted on the directions of the Supreme Court comprising geologists and archaeologists
 samiti ne panchamrita se ksharan kii ashanka ke maddenjar isaki maatra simit karne kii anushansa kii thi
 Pt
 vyas jaise anek vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki anadi kaal se shivlinga par panchamrita chadhaakar abhishek hota rahaa he, yadi milavati saamagree se nuksaan kii ashanka he to mandir prabandhan khud shuddh saamagree jaise doodh, shahad, shakar, dahi or ghi uplabdh karaae
 The temple management, following the committee's suggestions, informed the court that khandasari made of jaggery would be used in Panchamrit in place of sugar
 ab tak shakar bure ko shivlinga par ragada jaataa tha, jo ab pratibandhit hoga
 The temple management assured the court that after five o'clock in the evening only dry worship would be done, no one would be allowed to offer water and before that the moisture of the Shivling and the sanctum sanctorum would be dried with fans
 isse pehle tak bhi shaam ko shringaar ke baad jalaabhishak kii anumati nahin di jaati thi
 Cannabis have been made with cannabis
 shivlinga ksharan par pehle bhi chintaa vyakt kii jaati rahi he or garbhagrih main pravesh tathaa shivlinga ke sparsh ko pratibandhit kiye jane ke suzav die gaye
 It is said that the heat and sweat of the hands of the devotees damages the Shivalinga, but the opponents of this suggestion argued that Mahakal is Shaktipunj and devotees gain energy from them by touch
 isliye yah suzav thande baste main daal diya gaya tha
 There has been an increase in the number of devotees visiting here in the past years
 yah desh kaa ekmaatr dakshinmukhi jyotirling he, so tantra puja main iskaa bahut mahatv he
 This giant Jyotirlinga is Swayambhu, hence its importance is also high
 sarkaar kiski hoti he
 This question is different from the question of who the government is for
 kya sarkaar uski nahin hoti jisaki party chunaav main jitati he
 Actually, this is not a difficult question
 kai baar partiyaan bachakaani daleelein dekar is sawaal ko mushkil kar detii hai
 If the government does not belong to the party, then it will party main koun-koun he yaa party kiski he ye alag sawaal ho saktaa he
 We all know and BJP also accepts that RSS organizations and ordinary workers have a big role in winning its elections
 sangh ke kaaryakarta apana ghar baar chhod maheenon chunavi rajya main rahane chale jate hai
 Union workers from other states have gone to every village in Bihar
 sangh yah kaam janata se chipa kar nahin karata
 He does it in front of him
 ye or baat he ki sangh bijepi ke alaava kisi or ko nahin jeetaata he
 So how will you move between Sangh and BJP and why
 jab sangh ke prachaarak bijepi main adhyaksh se lekar pradhanmantri banate hai to is antar ko suvidhanusaar dekhnaa yaa nazarandaaz karnaa kya doharaapan nahin hoga
 According to me, the RSS should take account of everything the government does
 balki sarkaar or sangh ke bich ek mobile ap bhi hona chahie, jisamen har faisla lene ke pehle or lene ke baad aa jaae or donon ke bich real time main samvaad ho jaae
 Madhyanchal is a Madhya Pradesh government guest house behind Hotel Grand in Vasant Kunj area in Delhi
 yaheen par rashtriya swayan sevak sangh pichley do dinon se bijepi or modi sarkaar ke mantriyon se hisaab maang rahaa he
 Our long-time ally Akhilesh Sharma, who has covered the BJP, has written in his report that more than ninety leaders of the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh and its fraternal organizations are taking accounts from the ministers
 is baithak kaa makasad he ki modi sarkaar ko sangh ke agenda se bhatakane nahin diya jaae
 For three days, all the big ministers are coming and giving accounts of the work of their department, but this important coordination meeting is called by Ram Madhav as general meeting
 kya kisi saamaanya baithak main teen din tak mantri line lagaakar apane vibhaag kaa hisaab dete hai
 The Prime Minister is taking accounts from the Ministers, then why are the Union heads and their allied organizations taking accounts
 khayr main sirf kuch hi mantriyon ke naam pard rahaa hum
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar, Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, Urban Development Minister m Venkaiah Naidu, Health Minister JP Nadda, Chemicals and Fertilizers Minister Anant Kumar, Kalraj Mishra, Radha Mohan Singh, Nirmala Sitharaman
 bijepi adhyaksh, party kaa puraa sansadeey board bhi is baithak main shaamil he
 Now this very important meeting should not be called so common that it seemed that all of them suddenly had an extra time of three days, then thought why not walk in the mid-day in the beautiful valley of Aravali and enjoy the break
 kaha gaya ki saamaajik aarthik chunautiyon par charchaa ho rahi he
 Have these challenges increased so much that the entire government has to appear before the sixteen organizations of the Sangh
 kya yah acchhee baat nahin he ki mantriyon se kaam kaa hisaab lekar rashtriya swayan sevak sangh sarkaar kii kamyaabi or naakaami kii javabdehi le rahaa he
 Now it has to be seen whether the agenda of the Sangh is in the bjp's vision document or election manifesto
 kya sangh kaa agenda or ghoshnaptr ke bich duuri honi chahie
 The news coming from this meeting may be due to the kindness of the sources, but Akhilesh Sharma said that the Sangh has made better arrangements for the media
 yahaan tak ki media ke shaamiyane se bhi foging mashin se machharon ko bhagaaya gaya he
 Thank you RSS for taking such a care of us
 jo log soshal media main aresas kaa naam lekar hamen bhala bura kehete hai wo dekhen ki aresas hamaara kitna khyaal karata he
 Akhilesh Sharma said that perhaps the Sangh is trying to show that the government belongs to him
 wo bos he
 The hot line remains open between the government party and the top leaders of the Sangh, so every problem is resolved
 vaajapeyi yug kii tarah nahin he ki har vakt tanaav hi rahata tha
 This is not so in the Modi era
 ek baat par akhilesh ko lagata he ki jis tarah se amit shah 15 lakh sadasyon ko kaaryakarta banane kii training de rahe hai usase lagata he ki bijepi chunaav ke maamle main sangh par nirbharta kam karnaa chaahati hogi
 But if the government does its presentation in front of RSS and Vishwa Hindu Parishad, it does not seem that this dependency is going to end so easily
 is baithak se ye to dikhaa ki sarkaar sangh ke prati javabdeh he or sangh sarkaar kii javabdehi ko lekar sachet he
 On the third day, the Prime Minister can come and at the end Sangh Chief Mohan Bhagwat will give a speech ab aate hai ki vipaksh par
 What is his objection congress kaa kahana he ki van rank van peshan ke liye dharne par baithe sainikon se milane ke liye sarkaar ke paas vakt nahin he
 Has the union become more important than the military
 congress netaa manish tiwari ne kaha ki is baithak se yahi lagata he ki remot control ab saamne se control karne laga he
 Modi may be the Prime Minister but Bas Bhagwat
 sarkaar sangh kii kathputli he
 NCP leader Omar Abdullah said whether anyone would like to tell me after this meeting that it is a social organization
 aam aadmi party ke raghav chaddha ne kaha ki aresas kya sanvaidhanik sanstha he jise sarkaar report kar rahi he
 This has weakened the elected parliamentary democracy
 ab aap samaj gaye honge
 Is it going to be equal to this? manmohan singh sarkaar ke daur main bijepi kaa ye mukhya aarope tha ki manmohan singh to pradhanmantri he hi nahin
 The government operates from 10 Janpath
 manmohan sarkaar ko remote sarkaar kaha gaya
 You know that a National Advisory Committee was formed in the UPA Government, NAC was headed by Sonia Gandhi
 yah ek kism kaa cabinet pad tha
 It used to be written on the NAC website that our job is to give input to the government so that it will help in formulating social security policies
 kahin yahi baat aresas to nahin kahata he
 Now i am not saying that there was an RSS in the Congress or there is a Congress in the RSS as well
 pleez mere peeche mat pad jaaiyegaa
 In those days BJP used to say that the post of Prime Minister was weakened by NAC which has become stronger after Modi's arrival
 aresas kii samanvay baithak se congress ko ummid jaagi he ki unki tarah inke bhi pradhanmantri kaa pad kamazor hua he yaa ho rahaa he
 Remember when the BJP had to choose the prime ministerial candidate
 sangh aage nahin aata to aaj tak pradhanmantri kii ummdeevaar ko lekar jhagada chal rahaa hota
 The comments jab uski bhoomika pradhanmantri ke ummidavaar chunane se lekar, jitaane tak main ho sakati he to poochne main kyon na ho ki kya kaam ho rahaa he
 Many people would have been happy to hear these questions, but in this happiness, the question should not be missed whether there is really anyone who asks for an account from Prime Minister Modi
 unke mantri unke alaava kisi or ko prajentation de aayen
 Then one must walk and see who he is
 ham sab jaanate hai or bijepi bhi sweekaar karti he ki uske chunaav jeetne main aresas ke sanghathan or saadhaaran kaaryakartaaon kaa bada role hota he
 Sangh workers leave their homes and go to live in an electoral state for months
 bihar ke gaanv-gaanv main duusare rajyon se sangh ke kaaryakarta gaye hai
 The Sangh does not hide this work from the public
 uske saamne jaakar karata he
 It is another matter that the Sangh does not win anyone other than BJP
 to aap sangh or bijepi main kaise atanr karenge or kyon karenge
 When the pracharaks of the Sangh go from president to prime minister in BJP, it would not be easy to see this difference conveniently or ignore it
 mere hisaab se to aresas ko sarkaar ke har kaam kaa hisaab lenaa chahie
 Rather, there should be a mobile app between the government and the union, in which every decision comes before and after it is taken and the two get communicated in real time
 dilli main vasant kunj ilaake main hotel grand ke peeche madhya pradesh sarkaar kaa ek guest house he madhyanchal
 It is here that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has been seeking accounts from the BJP and Modi government ministers for the last two days
 bijepi ko lambey samay se cover karne vaale hamaare sahyogi akhilesh sharma ne apni report main likhaa he ki yahaan rashtriya swany sevak sangh or uske bhatru sanghathanon ke nabbe se adhik netaa mantriyon se kaam kaa hisaab le rahe hai
 The purpose of this meeting is not to allow the Modi government to deviate from the Sangh's agenda
 teen dinon tak sabhi bade mantri aakar apane vibhaag ke kaam kaa hisaab de rahe hai lekin is mahatvapurn samanvay baithak ko ram madhav ne saamaanya baithak kehete hai
 Do the ministers keep a line for three days in a general meeting and report their department
 pradhanmantri to mantriyon se hisaab lete hi he phir sangh pramukh or unke sahyogi sanghathan kyon hisaab le rahe hai
 Well, i am reading the names of only a few ministers
 vitt mantri arun jetali, videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj, raksha mantri manohar parrikar, parivahan mantri nitin gadakari, shahari vikaas mantri em venkaiya naidu, swasthya mantri je pi nadda, rasayan va urvarak mantri anant kumaar, calraj mishra, radha mohan sih, nirmala sitaraman
 The BJP President, the party's entire parliamentary board is also involved in this meeting
 ab is ati mahatvapurn baithak ko itnaa bhi saamaanya na kaha jaae ki aisa laga ki in sabake paas achaanak teen din kaa extra time batch gaya to sochaa ki kyon na aravali kii khubasurat vaadi main bane madhyanchal main chalakar madhyantar kaa lutf liya jaae
 It was said that socio-economic challenges are being discussed
 kya ye chunautiyaan itani bad gayi hai ki sangh ke solah sanghathanon ke saamne puri sarkaar ko haazir hona pade
 Is it not a good thing that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is taking accountability of the success and failure of the Union Government by taking account of the work from the ministers
 ab yah dekhnaa hoga ki jo sangh kaa agenda he wo bijepi ke vijan dacument yaa chunavi ghoshnaptr main he yaa nahin
 Should there be a distance between the agenda and the manifesto of the Sangh
 is baithak se aane vaali khabaren bhale hi sutron kii meharbaani kii dein hon magar akhilesh sharma ne bataaya ki sangh ne media ke liye behatar intazaam kiye hai
 Even mosquitoes have been driven away by the fogging machine due to media awakening
 hamaara itnaa khyaal rakhane ke liye aresas kaa shukriya
 Those who call us good and bad by taking the name of RSS in social media, see how much RSS takes care of us
 akhilesh sharma ne kaha ki shaayad sangh yah jataane kaa prayaas kar rahaa he ki sarkaar uski he
 He is the boss
 sarkaar party or sangh ke sheersh netaaon ke bich haat line khuli rahati he isliye har samasya kaa samaadhaan nikaal liya jaataa he
 It is not like the Vajpayee era that there was tension all the time
 modi yug main aisa nahin he
 On one thing, Akhilesh feels that the way Amit Shah is training 15 lakh members to become activists, it seems that BJP will want to reduce dependence on the Sangh in the matter of elections
 lekin aresas, vishwa hindu parishad ke saamne sarkaar apana prajentation karen to lagata nahin ki ye nirbharta itani aasaani se khatm hone vaali he
 From this meeting it shows that the government is accountable to the union and is conscious about the accountability of the union government
 tisare din pradhanmantri aa sakate hai or ant main sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat bhaashan denge
 Now come to the opposition
 uskaa kya etraz he
 The Congress says that the government has no time to meet the soldiers sitting on the dharna for the One Rank One Passion
 kya sainik se zyada sangh mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 Congress leader Manish Tiwari said that it seems from this meeting that remote control is now being controlled from the front
 modi bhale hi pradhanmantri hon lekin baas bhagwat hai
 The government is a puppet of the Union
 ensipi netaa omar abdulla ne kaha ki kya is baithak ke baad bhi koi mujhase kahana chahega ki ye saamaajik sanghathan he
 Raghav Chadha of Aam Aadmi Party said that RSS is a constitutional body which the government is reporting
 isse chunaa hua sansadeey loktantr kamazor hua he
 Now you must have understood
 kahin ye iz ikval tu to nahin ho rahaa he
 In the era of Manmohan Singh government, the main charge of BJP was that Manmohan Singh is not the Prime Minister at all
 sarkaar to das janpath se chalati he
 The Manmohan government was called a remote government
 aap jaanate hai ki upie sarkaar main ek rashtriya salaahkaar samiti bani thi, NAC kii adhyaksha sonia gandhi thim
 It was a kind of cabinet post
 NAC kii website par likhaa hota tha ki hamaara kaam sarkaar ko input dena he taaki use saamaajik suraksha kii nitiyaan banane main madad mili
 Is the RSS not saying the same thing? ab main yah nahin kah rahaa ki congress main bhi ek aresas tha yaa aresas main bhi ek congress he
 Please do not follow me
 un dinon bijepi kaha karti thi ki NAC se pradhanmantri kaa pad kamazor hua jo ab modi ke aane ke baad majboot ho gaya he
 From the coordination meeting of the RSS, the Congress is hopeful that the Prime Minister's post like him has weakened or is happening
 yaad kiijie jab bijepi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar chunanaa tha
 If the Sangh had not come forward, there would have been a fight over the Prime Minister's candidature till date
 tippaniyan When his role can range from choosing a prime minister candidate to winning, why not ask what work is going on
 ye sawaal sunakar to bahut log khush ho gaye honge lekin is khushi main kahin yah sawaal miss na ho jaae ki kya vaaki koi aisa he jo pradhanmantri modi se hisaab maang le
 His ministers should give a presentation to someone other than him
 tab to chal kar dekhnaa hi chahie ki wo koun he
 So how will you move between Sangh and BJP and why
 jab sangh ke prachaarak bijepi main adhyaksh se lekar pradhanmantri banate hai to is antar ko suvidhanusaar dekhnaa yaa nazarandaaz karnaa kya doharaapan nahin hoga

 teen dinon tak sabhi bade mantri aakar apane vibhaag ke kaam kaa hisaab de rahe hai lekin is mahatvapurn samanvay baithak ko ram madhav ne saamaanya baithak kehete hai
 Do the ministers keep a line for three days in a general meeting and report their department
 pradhanmantri to mantriyon se hisaab lete hi he phir sangh pramukh or unke sahyogi sanghathan kyon hisaab le rahe hai
 Well, i am reading the names of only a few ministers
 vitt mantri arun jetali, videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj, raksha mantri manohar parrikar, parivahan mantri nitin gadakari, shahari vikaas mantri em venkaiya naidu, swasthya mantri je pi nadda, rasayan va urvarak mantri anant kumaar, calraj mishra, radha mohan sih, nirmala sitaraman
 The BJP President, the party's entire parliamentary board is also involved in this meeting
 ab is ati mahatvapurn baithak ko itnaa bhi saamaanya na kaha jaae ki aisa laga ki in sabake paas achaanak teen din kaa extra time batch gaya to sochaa ki kyon na aravali kii khubasurat vaadi main bane madhyanchal main chalakar madhyantar kaa lutf liya jaae
 It was said that socio-economic challenges are being discussed
 kya ye chunautiyaan itani bad gayi hai ki sangh ke solah sanghathanon ke saamne puri sarkaar ko haazir hona pade
 Is it not a good thing that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is taking accountability of the success and failure of the Union Government by taking account of the work from the ministers
 ab yah dekhnaa hoga ki jo sangh kaa agenda he wo bijepi ke vijan dacument yaa chunavi ghoshnaptr main he yaa nahin
 Should there be a distance between the agenda and the manifesto of the Sangh
 is baithak se aane vaali khabaren bhale hi sutron kii meharbaani kii dein hon magar akhilesh sharma ne bataaya ki sangh ne media ke liye behatar intazaam kiye hai
 Even mosquitoes have been driven away by the fogging machine due to media awakening
 hamaara itnaa khyaal rakhane ke liye aresas kaa shukriya
 Those who call us good and bad by taking the name of RSS in social media, see how much RSS takes care of us
 akhilesh sharma ne kaha ki shaayad sangh yah jataane kaa prayaas kar rahaa he ki sarkaar uski he
 He is the boss
 sarkaar party or sangh ke sheersh netaaon ke bich haat line khuli rahati he isliye har samasya kaa samaadhaan nikaal liya jaataa he
 It is not like the Vajpayee era that there was tension all the time
 modi yug main aisa nahin he
 On one thing, Akhilesh feels that the way Amit Shah is training 15 lakh members to become activists, it seems that BJP will want to reduce dependence on the Sangh in the matter of elections
 lekin aresas, vishwa hindu parishad ke saamne sarkaar apana prajentation karen to lagata nahin ki ye nirbharta itani aasaani se khatm hone vaali he
 From this meeting it shows that the government is accountable to the union and is conscious about the accountability of the union government
 tisare din pradhanmantri aa sakate hai or ant main sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat bhaashan denge
 Now come to the opposition
 uskaa kya etraz he
 The Congress says that the government has no time to meet the soldiers sitting on the dharna for the One Rank One Passion
 kya sainik se zyada sangh mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 Congress leader Manish Tiwari said that it seems from this meeting that remote control is now being controlled from the front
 modi bhale hi pradhanmantri hon lekin baas bhagwat hai
 The government is a puppet of the Union
 ensipi netaa omar abdulla ne kaha ki kya is baithak ke baad bhi koi mujhase kahana chahega ki ye saamaajik sanghathan he
 Raghav Chadha of Aam Aadmi Party said that RSS is a constitutional body which the government is reporting
 isse chunaa hua sansadeey loktantr kamazor hua he
 Now you must have understood
 kahin ye iz ikval tu to nahin ho rahaa he
 In the era of Manmohan Singh government, the main charge of BJP was that Manmohan Singh is not the Prime Minister at all
 sarkaar to das janpath se chalati he
 The Manmohan government was called a remote government
 aap jaanate hai ki upie sarkaar main ek rashtriya salaahkaar samiti bani thi, NAC kii adhyaksha sonia gandhi thim
 It was a kind of cabinet post
 NAC kii website par likhaa hota tha ki hamaara kaam sarkaar ko input dena he taaki use saamaajik suraksha kii nitiyaan banane main madad mili
 Is the RSS not saying the same thing? ab main yah nahin kah rahaa ki congress main bhi ek aresas tha yaa aresas main bhi ek congress he
 Please do not follow me
 un dinon bijepi kaha karti thi ki NAC se pradhanmantri kaa pad kamazor hua jo ab modi ke aane ke baad majboot ho gaya he
 From the coordination meeting of the RSS, the Congress is hopeful that the Prime Minister's post like him has weakened or is happening
 yaad kiijie jab bijepi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar chunanaa tha
 If the Sangh had not come forward, there would have been a fight over the Prime Minister's candidature till date
 tippaniyan When his role can range from choosing a prime minister candidate to winning, why not ask what work is going on
 ye sawaal sunakar to bahut log khush ho gaye honge lekin is khushi main kahin yah sawaal miss na ho jaae ki kya vaaki koi aisa he jo pradhanmantri modi se hisaab maang le
 His ministers should give a presentation to someone other than him
 tab to chal kar dekhnaa hi chahie ki wo koun he

 The news coming from this meeting may be due to the kindness of the sources, but Akhilesh Sharma said that the Sangh has made better arrangements for the media
 yahaan tak ki media ke shaamiyane se bhi foging mashin se machharon ko bhagaaya gaya he
 Thank you RSS for taking such a care of us
 jo log soshal media main aresas kaa naam lekar hamen bhala bura kehete hai wo dekhen ki aresas hamaara kitna khyaal karata he
 Akhilesh Sharma said that perhaps the Sangh is trying to show that the government belongs to him
 wo bos he
 The hot line remains open between the government party and the top leaders of the Sangh, so every problem is resolved
 vaajapeyi yug kii tarah nahin he ki har vakt tanaav hi rahata tha
 This is not so in the Modi era
 ek baat par akhilesh ko lagata he ki jis tarah se amit shah 15 lakh sadasyon ko kaaryakarta banane kii training de rahe hai usase lagata he ki bijepi chunaav ke maamle main sangh par nirbharta kam karnaa chaahati hogi
 But if the government does its presentation in front of RSS and Vishwa Hindu Parishad, it does not seem that this dependency is going to end so easily
 is baithak se ye to dikhaa ki sarkaar sangh ke prati javabdeh he or sangh sarkaar kii javabdehi ko lekar sachet he
 On the third day, the Prime Minister can come and at the end Sangh Chief Mohan Bhagwat will give a speech ab aate hai ki vipaksh par
 What is his objection congress kaa kahana he ki van rank van peshan ke liye dharne par baithe sainikon se milane ke liye sarkaar ke paas vakt nahin he
 Has the union become more important than the military
 congress netaa manish tiwari ne kaha ki is baithak se yahi lagata he ki remot control ab saamne se control karne laga he
 Modi may be the Prime Minister but Bas Bhagwat
 sarkaar sangh kii kathputli he
 NCP leader Omar Abdullah said whether anyone would like to tell me after this meeting that it is a social organization
 aam aadmi party ke raghav chaddha ne kaha ki aresas kya sanvaidhanik sanstha he jise sarkaar report kar rahi he
 This has weakened the elected parliamentary democracy
 ab aap samaj gaye honge
 Is it going to be equal to this? manmohan singh sarkaar ke daur main bijepi kaa ye mukhya aarope tha ki manmohan singh to pradhanmantri he hi nahin
 The government operates from 10 Janpath
 manmohan sarkaar ko remote sarkaar kaha gaya
 You know that a National Advisory Committee was formed in the UPA Government, NAC was headed by Sonia Gandhi
 yah ek kism kaa cabinet pad tha
 It used to be written on the NAC website that our job is to give input to the government so that it will help in formulating social security policies
 kahin yahi baat aresas to nahin kahata he
 Now i am not saying that there was an RSS in the Congress or there is a Congress in the RSS as well
 pleez mere peeche mat pad jaaiyegaa
 In those days BJP used to say that the post of Prime Minister was weakened by NAC which has become stronger after Modi's arrival
 aresas kii samanvay baithak se congress ko ummid jaagi he ki unki tarah inke bhi pradhanmantri kaa pad kamazor hua he yaa ho rahaa he
 Remember when the BJP had to choose the prime ministerial candidate
 sangh aage nahin aata to aaj tak pradhanmantri kii ummdeevaar ko lekar jhagada chal rahaa hota
 The comments jab uski bhoomika pradhanmantri ke ummidavaar chunane se lekar, jitaane tak main ho sakati he to poochne main kyon na ho ki kya kaam ho rahaa he
 Many people would have been happy to hear these questions, but in this happiness, the question should not be missed whether there is really anyone who asks for an account from Prime Minister Modi
 unke mantri unke alaava kisi or ko prajentation de aayen
 Then one must walk and see who he is
 akhilesh sharma ne kaha ki shaayad sangh yah jataane kaa prayaas kar rahaa he ki sarkaar uski he
 He is the boss
 sarkaar party or sangh ke sheersh netaaon ke bich haat line khuli rahati he isliye har samasya kaa samaadhaan nikaal liya jaataa he

 He also said that the film should not be of any female or male head
 aap aisa karke mahilaon ko nicha dikhaate hai
 Kabir's name may have been heard, but do you know what it means in Arabic? Richa told the likes of the filmmakers that after getting the film Gangs of Wasseypur he was getting that type of films and after the role of Bholi Punjaban he got that type The rolls started getting
 richa kaa kahana he, 'nirmaataa vaise hi role chaahate the

 Change is coming and reaching every category

 baaki itihaas ke bare main sab jaanate hai

 'sensor board ke kaary ko lekar vaani treepathi ne kaha ki agar mahilaon ke chitrankan ko ashleel kiya jayega to film paas nahin karenge
 During this time Anubhav said that if the entire rules are followed then the film cannot be made
 yah niyam pehle bane the or jab wo bane the jab samvidhan bane kuch saal hi hue the
 Guidelines are too much and this should be the case
 'filmon main chali aa rahi ruudhivaadee parpanraon ko lekar richa ne kaha, 'aajkal parivartan ho rahaa he
 By the way, change is necessary at the grassroots level in the society
 hamen publicity or chintracan ke samay lard rahe hai

 ' unhone yah bhi kaha ki kalakaaron ke alaava anya kru members ke saath kya ho rahaa he us par dhyaan dena aavashyak he
 On the Meetu campaign, Richa said, 'this journalism happens everywhere in politics
 magar bollywood main kai hai, bas wo pakade gaye hai magar doshi sabit nahin hue
 They have been doing this for a long time
 kaha jaataa he ki bollywood vaale aage nahin aate or jo aage aate hai unka kya hota he unka kariyar kharaab kar diya gaya
 There are many producers in Bollywood who are not interested in making films, but are interested in interest
 'item number ko lekar anubhav ne kaha ki item number ek sexulity he or yah samaaj kaa hissaa he or usee ke liye hote hai
 Hero's entry is part of our DNA, as many pages were written on Ramchandra ji when he came
 vaise hi ab hota he
 At the same time, Richa said, "earlier people were called from outside for the item number and now the actresses do it themselves

 a recent study by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) states that the attitude of Indian banks on the issue of changes in interest rates is not favorable to consumers
 bhartiya bank karj par byaaj dar badhaane ke maamle main to turant kadam uthaate hai, lekin jab jamaa-raashi par byaaj dar badhaane kii baat aati he to unka ravaiya kaaphi dhilaa rahata he
 The IMF research paper also clarified that the pace of change in interest rates has been slow since the RBI announced policy rate cuts
 imef kii arthshaastri sonaali das ke ek anusandhan patr 'bharat kii maudrik niti, bank byaaj dar kaa preshan' main kaha gaya he ki nitigat dar main badlaavon kaa bank byaaj daron main antaran dhimaa rahaa he

 iske alaava haal ke saalon main nitigat dar main badlaav ke saath hi jamaa or rin byaaj daron main samaayojan kii gati badi he
 ' isse pehle bhi imef ne is maamle ko saamne rakhaa tha ki bhartiya bank, kendriya bank kii maudrik niti main sakhti par zyada teji se amal karte hai
 In this case, many people, including RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, had said that banks avoid giving benefits of policy rate cuts
 unhone kaha, 'maudrik niti samaayojan ke visham sakshya he, nitigat dar main kami ke mukaable sakhti ke samay bank byaaj daron main zyada teji se samyojit kii jaatin hai
 Apart from this, the pace of adjustment in deposit and loan interest rates has increased with the change in policy rate in recent years
 ' Earlier, the IMF had also put forward the case that Indian banks are more vigilant in the monetary policy of the central bank
 is maamle main arabiai governor raghuram rajan samet kai logon ne kaha tha ki bank nitigat dar main katautee kaa phayda dene se bachate hai

 ajtak ke iraq main laapata 39 bharatiyon ke khulaase par videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne loksabhaa main bayaan diya
 Speaking in Lok Sabha, Sushma Swaraj said that this matter is very serious
 unhone kaha ki main is baat ko hangaame ke dauraan nahin boluungi, puraa desh is maamle ko sunanaa chahta he
 Sushma said that i have not given any statement in the Rajya Sabha on this matter
 sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki main shuru se hi loksabhaa main bayaan dena chaahati thi
 This incident is 20 days after the arrival of our government
 us samay harjit ne ye bayaan diya tha ki main mere saamne 39 logon ko maar diya gaya tha, or main bhaag kar aa gaya tha
 But we did not find corpses, nor any list, and so how can we tell
 harjit ke bayaan main kaaphi virodhabhas he, jis mudde ko uthaaya gaya tha
 We have searched around Mosul, everything i have done with confidence in the House
 On 24 November 2014 i said that a person is saying that he has been killed, and 6 sources are saying that he Should i not find them if i am alive? maine baar-baar sadan se kaha tha ki mere paas unke jivit hone kaa koi saboot nahin he, naa hi mere paas unke maare jane kaa koi thos saboot nahin he
 i would like the permission of the House that if my path is right then we can move forward in it
 iske liye mujhe bayaan bhi diya gaya tha
 Accused of misleading for three years
 bina thos saboot ke unhen mara hua ghoshit nahin kar sakati he, aisa karnaa paap he main ye paap kabhi nahin karongi
 i found that it could help with turkey, i myself went to Turkey to talk
 piem ne bhi is mudde par baat kii
 Our sources are not like this, we have been told by the President of one country, the foreign minister of one country
 main 12 baar peediton ke parivaar se mili hum, maine har baar kaha ki mere paas unke jivit rahane kii koi jaankaree nahin he, main sutron ke hawaale se ye kah rahi hum
 Cannot close their file unless there is evidence
 sushamaa ne kaha ki agar main aaj kah duun ki wo mar gaye hai par kal ko koi jivit hua to kise dosha denge
 If a family has lost their trust in me, then they are free
 maine kabhi nahin kaha ki wo log jail main band hai
 On the 9th, Mosul was declared independent, on the 10th our foreign minister reached Mosul
 wo 4 din vahaan par rahe
 i called the family of the victims only after VK Singh arrived
 wike singh ne kaha tha ki hamaare sutron ke hawaale se wo log vahaan pakade gaye, phir unhen hospital main rakhaa gaya phir kheti karwaai gai
 But we have no contact with them since 2016
 hamen jo pataa laga hamanen vahi parivaar ko bataaya
 Sushma said that the picture only shows that the jail has collapsed, but the picture does not show that all the people have been killed
 iraq ke videsh mantri ne kaha ki hamaare paas naa hi jinda hone yaa maare jane kaa thos saboot he, 2016 ke baad koi soochna nahin he
 But still the search continues
 maine unase apil kii he ki ab jo bhi jaankaree den to saboot ke saath den, bina saboot ab main parivaar se baat nahin kar sakati hum
 i have asked him to talk to the prison ward so that he can know something about the Indians
 ye bhartiya log vahaan par construkashan workas the lekin vahaan par funs gaye
 Sushma said that if she writes her name and home address in Hindi as proof, then we will get help
 hamen unki ore se puraa bharosa diya gaya he
 i have never misled the Parliament, what would have been the benefit of misleading me
 gumraah karne se naa mujhe kuch milegaa naa sarkaar ko
 It is easy for me if i declare them dead today, no one will ask me questions
 main apana ferj nibhaa rahi hum
 Referring to an incident, Sushma said that 6 families from Punjab came to meet her, and said that she was declared a martyr in the 1971 war but after 45 years the person near the village returned and said that those people were alive Huh
 tab se wo parivaar kah rahaa he ki hamaare parivaar waalon ko waapas laana chahie
 Sushma said that a child of 7 years old crossed the border playing with her father in the field 21 years ago, her name is Nanak Singh
 lekin uske parivaar vaale kehete hai ki wo pakistan main he use waapas lao
 Major Dhan Singh Thapa was first declared a martyr, gave him the award but later he came out alive
 sushamaa ne kaha ki main jo bhi baat boluungi wo saboot ke saath boluungi, maine kabhi nahin kaha ki wo jinda hai yaa maare gaye hai
 i cannot come to any conclusion until any concrete evidence is found
 sirf ek vyakti kah rahaa he wo maare gaye or hamaare kai sutara kah rahe hai ki wo jinda hai
 Any evidence that will reveal it, i will wait for that day

 saath hi in logon ne sarkaar se yah bhi jaananaa chaha ki kya bhartiya khufia tantra is maamle main vifal sabit hua he
 No strong evidence: Iraqi Foreign Minister Earlier, Iraq's Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-jafri, who visited India, said there was no strong evidence of the surviving or dead Indians in Mosul
 iraqi videsh mantrine kaha ki uske paas is baat ke koi ‚Äò‚Äòpukhta saboot‚Äô‚Äô nahin hai ki teen saal pehle mosul main agava kiye gaye 39 bhartiya jivit hai yaa unki mrityu ho chuki he
 However, Iraq has confirmed that ISIS has been destroyed by the terrorist organization ISIS, where the 39 Indians were last reported
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne videsh rajya mantri wike singh kii iraq yatra ke dauraan jutai gai soochnaaon ke aadhaar par 16 july ko bayaan diya tha ki agava kiye gaebhartiya uttar-pashchim mosulmen sthit badush jail main band ho sakate hai
 Significantly, Iraqi security forces freed Mosul from ISIS occupation about two weeks ago

 The terrorist organization Islamic State (ISIS) has completely destroyed Mosul

 Now the question is arising that where did these Indians go? Earlier, the Indian government claimed that these Indians were alive

 For those who want to stay away from any kind of risk, a fixed deposit may be the best option, but fixed return investments are not completely safe
 apane liye beemaa kii koi upyukt yojana lene se pehle aapako bahut chaanbin or tamaam yojanaon se tulana karne kii jarurat hoti he
 Anirudh Jain, head of Centrum Group, says, "all the insurance schemes available in the market are for different financial needs such as term policy for regular income, endowment policy for regular savings, unit-linked insurance scheme for collection of funds
 (ULIP)
 ''log aksar vishuddh beemaa product ke maamle main aaajeevan yojana (hole life turm plan) or kisi niyamit yojana ke bich nirnay nahin kar pate or duvidha main pad jate hai
 Regular term plans are relatively cheaper, while lifetime plans offer long-term security
 aaajeevan yojana or regular yojana ke bich chunaav karne kii duvidha ko dur karne ke liye ham yahaan donon yojanaon ke nafe or nuksaan ko samajhane kii koshish karte hai
 Interpolicy market in both
 com ke associat diarector or cluster pramukh (life insurance) santosh agarwal kehete hai, ''niyamit avadhi jivan beemaa ek vishuddh suraksha dene vaali yojana he or yojana kii avadhi tak aapako suraksha detii he jabaki aaajeevan beemaa jivan ke ant tak suraksha detii he or aapako guarantishuda rakam kaa bhugtan karti he
 "life insurance scheme works as a legacy scheme for a family in which a person leaves a safe amount for his loved ones after his death
 mrityu ke baad milane vaale laabh ke alaava isamen paripakvata or jite ji ek nishchit rakam milti he
 With this, this plan goes on throughout his life
 agar policy dharak policy kii avadhi se zyada samay tak jivit rahata he to use paripakvata kaa laabh bhi miltaa he
 The downside of this policy is that it has a higher premium
 saath hi isaki fees or kamishan bhi adhik hota he or isamen kai sharten bhi lagu ho sakati hai
 On the other hand, the positive points of a regular or regular life insurance policy include benefits such as lower rate of premium, tax benefit and relatively more fixed amount
 aap is tarah kaa koi turm plan aasaani se le sakate hai kyonki inhen samajhnaa aasaan hota he
 But such schemes also have some drawbacks or downside
 aaajeevan jivan beemaa yojana ke vipareet niyamit jivan beemaa yojana main koi paripakvata laabh nahin hota or iskaa premium bhi bhavishya main bad saktaa he
 Also, like a life insurance plan, it also does not help in capital growth
 yuva banaam vruddh or jokhim kii kshamtaorovealth ke sah-sansthaapak vijay kuppa kehete hai ki ''koi bhi beemaa yojana lete samay aayu, jokhim uthaane kii kshamta or vittiya uddeshy ko dhyaan main rakhana jaruri he
 The younger generation can take a regular insurance scheme for financial security and invest the subsequent amount in the market to increase the capital
 lekin jo 40 saal yaa uske upar ke hai, unhen aaajeevan beemaa yojana kaa vikalp chunanaa chahie
 "experts say that everyone should take some regular life insurance as it is a completely safe plan which provides financial benefits to the dependents after death
 lekin agar aapke upar jimmedaariyaan hai or aap guarantishuda rakam chaahate hai to aaajeevan beemaa yojana behatarhai
