 @laluprasadrjd (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) The bjp's path to the presidential election has become easier
 nitish kumaar kii jediu ne bhi raashtrapati ke liye ramnath kovind kaa samarthan karne kii baat kah di he
 a decision was taken in this regard at Nitish Kumar's house
 jediu ke is stand ke baad vipaksh ko karaara jhatka laga he, jo apana pratyaashee utaarne kii soch rahaa tha
 JDU has also made it clear that it will not participate in the meeting of opposition parties on Thursday
 bijepi ne bihar ke purv rajyapal ramnath kovind ko apana pratyaashee chunaa he
 Nitish Kumar has earned much acclaim during Kovind's tenure for serving as an impartial governor
 ramnath kovind dalit samudaay kaa pramukh cheharaa rahe hai
 He was sent as the Governor of Bihar in 2015
 haalanki jab ramnath kovind ko bihar bheja gaya tha to unase koi paraamarsh nahin liya gaya tha
 But later the two developed a good relationship working together
 isliye nitish ke samarthan kii ek vajah yah bhi bataai ja rahi he
 Perhaps this was the reason that Nitish Kumar came to meet him as soon as Ramnath Kovind's name was announced
 haalanki sahyogi argedy ne ramnath kovind kaa samarthan na karne kaa faisla kiya hua he
 Communist Party of India (CPI) leader d Raja told NDTV when the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) President Ram Nath Kovind was supported by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, saying, "if Nitish (kumar) ) Has decided to support (ramnath) Kovind, so this is a setback (setback) for us
 
 
 sonia (gandhi) kii pichhali baithak main 17 opozishan (vipakshi) partiyaan ai thim
 
 
 Now we have to see how many parties come tomorrow
 
 
 " tippaniyan It is noteworthy that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar reached Raj Bhavan after Bihar Governor Ramnath Kovind was declared the presidential candidate by the NDA
 nitish ne kovind se mulaakaat ke baad kaha tha ki mere liye vyaktigat taur par yah prasannataa kii baat he ki bihar ke rajyapal desh ke raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ghoshit hue hai
 He did a very good job as the Governor of the state
 yah khushi kii baat he ki ve raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ghoshit hue hai, isliye meraa ferj banataa tha ki mukhyamantri ke rup main apane rajyapal se miluun
 i have met him to express my respect
 us din yah puche jane par ki kya ramnath kovind ko raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par jediu kaa samarthan he, nitish ne kaha tha ki in prashnon kaa uttar poochna abhi munasib nahin he
 BJP has elected former Bihar Governor Ramnath Kovind as its candidate
 nitish kumaar ne nishpaksh rajyapal ke rup main seva karne ke liye kovind ke kaarykaal ke dauraan kaaphi prashansa kii he
 Ramnath Kovind has been a prominent face of the Dalit community
 unhen 2015 main bihar kaa governor banaakar bheja gaya gaya
 However, when Ramnath Kovind was sent to Bihar, he was not consulted
 lekin baad main donon ke bich saath kaam karte hue acha rishta viksit ho gaya tha
 Therefore, one reason for Nitish's support is also being mentioned
 shaayad yahi vajah thi ki ramnath kovind ke naam kii ghoshnaa hote hi nitish kumaar unase milane pahunche the
 However, the ally RJD has decided not to support Ramnath Kovind
 rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) kii ore se raashtrapati pad ke pratyaashee banaae gaye ramnath kovind ko bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar dwaara samarthan die jane kii baat kehane par bhartiya communist party (sipiai) netaa di raja ne NDTV se kaha, "agar nitish (kumaar) ne (ramnath) kovind kaa samarthan karne kaa faisla kiya he, to yah hamaare liye setbac (jhatka) he

 After meeting Kovind, Nitish had said that it is a matter of personal pleasure for me that the Governor of Bihar has been declared the presidential candidate of the country
 pradesh ke rajyapal ke rup main unhone bahut hi behtareen kaary kiya
 It is heartening that they have been declared presidential candidates, so i was duty bound to meet my Governor as Chief Minister
 main apana sammaan prakat karne ke liye unase mila hum

 haalanki helicopter iskaa vikalp he, lekin iskaa kiraaya adhik hone ke kaaran kai yatri iske dwaara safar karne main sakasham nahin hai

 Let me tell you that Amitabh Bachchan is busy shooting for these days
 film main unka luk kaaphi alag he
 Many of its photos have been shared by Big B
 film kaa diarection anand pandit kar rahe hai
 Kriti Kharbanda, Emraan Hashmi are going to be seen with Amitabh Bachchan in the film
 bulandshahr ke baad ab meerut main trephic chaalaan kaate jane se naaraaz bijepi netaa police par bhadakte dikhaai die
 BJP councilor Ashu Rastogi not only heard the sound of SO Dhanveer Singh on the chaoti of his son's scooty, but also threatened to come to his senses
 buudhvaar ko hui is ghatana kaa video soshal media par viral ho gaya
 In this, Ashu Rastogi can be seen in high voice calling CO as good and bad
 haal main bulandshahr ke syana jile main bhi aisi hi ghatana hui thi
 Councilor supporters had raised a lot of dispute with Deputy Superintendent of Police Shrestha Singh over the bike challan being cut for violation of traffic rules by Pramod Lodhi, husband of BJP District Panchayat member there
 lekin shrestha ne dabaav main jhukne se inkaar karte hue kaha tha ki agar koi niyamon kaa ulanghan karegaa to uske khilaaf karrwai jarur hogi
 After this it is different that in a few days, the transfer of superior in routine transfers also became Bahraich
 meerut ke thana civil lines kshetra main surajkund chauraahey ke paas buudhvaar ko esao dhanvir singh checking kar rahe the
 Then the son of Councilor Ashu Rastogi was returning to Scooty from PL Sharma Road after studying the auspicious Rastogi tuition
 uske saath do dost or bhi the
 All three were riding on two scooties
 seetaram puliya ke paas civil lines thane ke kaaryvahak esao dhanvir singh ne unhen roka or skuti ke kaagaj maange
 Shubh did not have papers
 esao ne chaalaan kaatane kii baat kahi to shubh neparshad pitaaka hawala dekar dabaav daalane kii koshish kii
 Shubh called Father Ashu Rastogi
 aashu rastogi ne apane samarthakon ke saath maukey par pahunchakar dhanvir singh ko hadakaana shuru kar diya
 The video of this altercation went viral on social media
 aarope he ki esao ko vardi utarava dene or transfar karaane kii dhamkee bhi di gai
 During the fierce clash, Councilor Ashu Rastogi even said that the thieves are not caught, but the children are unnecessarily harassed
 parshad ne ghoose maangane kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 The councilor also said that the photo copy of the papers was kept in the scooty of Shubh
 jise esao ne maanane se inkaar kar diya
 According to Ashu Rastogi, he did not talk about getting off the uniform and getting the transfer, on the contrary, the SO did indecency with him
 esao dhanvir singh ke mutabik unhen ek car chaalak ne aakar shikaayat kii thi ki do skuti par teen ladke hallaa machaate aa rahe hai
 Along with that, they are also left colliding
 jab unhen roka gaya to unke paas kaagaj nahin the to unka chaalaan kaat diya gaya
 When asked about the incident, SO Dhanvir Singh in front of the camera, he thought it better to keep silence
 desh kii aazaadee ke saat dashak biit jane ke baad bhi sarkaar ab daawey main hi sahi, yah kah rahi he ki usne desh ke sabhi gaanvon ko vidyutikrut kar diya he
 But it would be interesting to know what it means to electrify villages? In India, the total number of households is 17
 99 karod hai
 But the latest figures show that 3 of the country
 14 karod gharon tak (is daawey ke baad bhi ki sabhi gaanv vidyutikrut ho gaye hai) bijli nahin pahunch pai he
 This is about 17 percent of the total households in the country
 aakhir bijli pahunchane main yah kami kahaan se ai? iskaa uttar gramin vidyutikaran niti, 2006 main di gai vidyutikaran kii paribhaasha main miltaa he
 Accordingly, if a village would be considered electrified, infrastructure like distribution transformers and transmission lines have been installed there and Dalit township has been included in that settlement, plus, 10% of the village or slum through this infrastructure
 Electricity could be delivered to homes
 bina bijli vaale gharon kii sankhya ke maamle main uttar pradesh sabase upree paaydaan par he
 Now let us take a look at the list of states which are ranked high in the worst list by the end of the month of April 2018 in terms of the number of houses without electricity

 But Dhoni was honest that he did not make excuses
 usne sweekaar kiya ki hamaare ballebaaj acha pradarshan nahin kar paae or unhone sirf tukdon main acha pradarshan kiya

 You get less chances in Test cricket and you should take advantage of it when you get opportunities

 Still Priyarvind Kejriwal When it was first reported that you were running ahead of Sheila Dixit in the New Delhi Assembly constituency, i was happy to feel like my Baba must have lost Indira Gandhi's defeat at the hands of Rajnarayan in 77
 magar uske baad jo kuch ho rahaa he, use dekhakar lag rahaa he, jaise suraj badjatya kii pikchar ke chakkar main haul main funs gaye hon
 The film is good, there are songs, action is done, drama is also there
 magar ye itti lambii he ki man kuskuta rahaa he ki kab khatm ho or kuch tazaadam hawa aae
 Well, i tell you my own
 train se daftar aata hum
 Metro train chunaav ke pehle, us train main jab bhi kisi se poochta, kya maahaul he
 Mostly say, this time it is a broom
 bada acha lagata sunakar
 Then when elections came, it seemed that the survey was false, the public riding on the metro was true
 magar ab usee train main sab bhunbhunate hai ki ye kejariwal sarkaar kyon nahin banaate hai
 And yes sir
 bijli ke bill abhi bhi bade hue hi aate hai
 My selfishness was small
 sochataa tha ki jhaadu vaale aaenge to mongu singh ko bhi thik kar denge
 Ever since Mangu Singh became the head of the Delhi Metro, this train has started running very intermittently
 magar ye kya
 You also left the metro from the metro
 chal to rahe hi nahin hai
 Just move a bit, give them the pleasure of walking and then stop at China
 aapane kaha, ham vipaksh main baithenge
 We said, welcome, did not get the mandate to take power
 phir final pikchar dekhakar laga ki ek hi surat banati he
 BJP cannot come with you and Congress with BJP at any cost
 ghode or ghaas kii yaari vaala maamla ho jaataa
 So AAP formed the government and the Congress agreed to support it from outside
 bijepi ne bhi rachanaatmak sahyog kii baat kahi
 The saying of our Kanpur was a matter of yours
 chitt bhi meri, patt bhi meri
 My father's
 magar sabakaa baap banane ke pher main aap rajnatik durandeshi na dikhaa paae
 Initially, he refused, but when he felt that yes can be done now, then he started making a role
 donon dalon ko chitthee likhi or kaha ki aap samarthan de rahe hai, magar pehle in 18 muddon par jawaab dijie
 And it was amazing that those who sought answers rejected them in the first line
 ise kehete hai darera dekar kaam lenaa
 However, this spectacle was also completed and after this you are now saying that you will ask the people of Delhi
 kaise puuchhenge
 Will write the letter, whole 25 lakhs
 sunakar hi gabbar vaala feel aata he
 But the message of this letter was not reached
 esemes mangavaayenge
 If the BJP or the Congress molested and got sms from phone calling people in bulk! Anyway, you have opened a front against Ambani, the owner of a company with SMS
 aap website par puuchhenge
 Here Modi's cyber army can spoil the game
 fasebuk par puuchhenge
 But the problem is with Chacha Gehlot, who is vacationing in Turkey
 vah ekamusth like girava sakate hai vahaan se
 Mohalla will go to the assembly
 haath uthvaayenge or phir ginati kar usee janata ko bataaenge
 We also know that if you do not love this, you are the beloved, and you will definitely form the government
 par uske pehle kitna jhilaayenge, intjaar karavaaenge
 Your party's 'veteran' Kumar Vishwas says that this is democracy
 to ek bataao sar ji, janata ke paas jane ke naam par aap kitne faislon ko kitni baar taaloge
 Let us understand the point by an example
 aap kehete hai ki sabhi ko 700 litre pani muft denge
 You became the CM and held meetings with the water authorities
 export bhi baithe or aakhri main yah baat bani ki 700 to nahin, magar 650 litre pani diya ja saktaa he
 Then you will write a letter again, SMS and get voting that we had said 700, but now we are able to give 650 only, do not give it
 matlab har faisle ke liye janata ke paas jaaenge
 You can call it Swaraj, the strength of democracy
 magar meri samaj ye kahati he ki agar cheez kaa faisla haath uthaakar hi hona hota, to is desh se kabhi sati pratha na jaati
 Widow marriages were never accepted
 bal vivaah abhi tak dhoe gaye hote
 The majority would always be in favor of status quo and free radicals and the country would become Lanka
 aapke hisaab se to puri kii puri lagi hi he, khayr
 You have asked public opinion of Delhi, so i am expressing my opinion
 sarkaar banaaie sarkaar
 Make and spend as much time as you can
 varanaa log kahenge ki badi baaten chhaunkani aati thim bas
 When killed, Bass was killed

 While every state government is announcing something every day to end the VIP culture, our honorable Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha mps are looking upset for it
 hamaare mananeey saansad chaahate hai ki air india kii tarah privet airlines bhi unhen 'maharaja' kii tarah yatra karaae
 It is said that the Ministry of Civil Aviation wants private airlines to provide royal facilities to about 800 members of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
 matlab saaf he ki saansad chaahate hai ki unhen free main khaanaa pinaa mili or unke saath aisa kuch kiya jaae, jisase yah lage ki vah viipi hai
 The system of special service to mps has been in force for the last three years, but the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has said in a directive issued to all airlines that airports and aviation companies are not complying with this system of courtesy
 haalanki is nirdesh par hallaa machane ke baad naagarik uddyan mantralay ne turant safai dete hue kaha ki aisa koi dishanirdesh jari nahin kiya gaya he
 The ministry said that no guidelines have been issued to give special courtesy facility to ministers and mps to private airlines

 (click here to see the notification) rajyasabha main buudhvaar ko naagarikta sanshodhan bill charchaa ke liye pesh kiya gaya
 During the discussion on the bill, there was a lot of chaos in the house
 tiemasi ke derek o bryan ne kaha ki jo desh ke log hai unka aap khyaal rakh nahin rahe hai or duusare ke sammaan kii baat kar rahe hai? bengal koi gujarat nahin he
 Derek o'brien said that this government is excellent at breaking promises
 sarkaar kahati he ki is bill ko lekar chintaa karne kaa koi kaaran he lekin main kahata hum chintaa karne kaa kaaran he
 He said that at the time of demonetisation, the government said that you give me 50 days, if the situation is not right then you will punish me in public place
 lekin wo nahin hua
 Derek o'brien said that these people lie
 jo kehete hai wo nahin karte, isliye is bill par chintaa kaa kaaran he
 Earlier, bjp's JP Nadda expressed his support for the bill
 unhone anand sharma par tanj kasate hue kaha ki vaise vakil jinke paas tark nahin hote hai wo mudde kii jagah duusari baton kaa zikr karte rahete hai
 Gandhi, talk more on this bill than what Savarkar said
 jepi nadda ne purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke bayaan kaa zikr bhi kiya jisamen unhone vahaan se aae shanarthiyon kii sthiti ke vishay main sadan main kaha tha
 In opposition to the bill, senior Congress leader Anand Sharma favored the party
 unhone kaha ki is naagarikta sanshodhan bill se puure desh main asuraksha kii bhaavana bhar gai he
 There is a fear in the minds of people
 agar aisa he to kya puure bharat main ditension centre banenge? yah anyaay hoga
 The senior Congress leader said that reincarnation is believed here
 unhone kaha ki sardaar patel agar modi ji se milenge to kaaphi naaraaz honge
 Anand Sharma taunted that Gandhiji's spectacles are not just for advertising
 anand sharma ne sadan main bill ke virodh main apana paksh rakhaa
 He said that this bill is against the basic spirit of the Constitution of India
 samvidhan kii prastaavna main hi dharmanirpekshata kaa zikr he, yah us mul bhaavana ke bhi khilaaf he
 During his speech, Anand Sharma referred to Mahatma Gandhi and said that he said that my house should be where there is no wall, where there are followers of all religions
 isse pehle grahamantri amit shah ne rajyasabha main naagarik sanshodhan bill pesh karte hue kaha ki yah bill desh ke musalamaanon ke khilaaf nahin he
 He said that our three neighboring countries are Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Islamic countries
 vahaan muslim bahulsankhyak hai
 Therefore, the citizenship amendment bill that has been introduced talks about granting citizenship of India to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Parsis and Christians
 is bill ke paas hone se in samudaayon ke logon ko jo ki 31 disambar, 2014 se pehle yahaan rah rahe hai unako bharat kii naagarikta mil jaaegi
 Those who are forced to live hellish life will get liberated
 amit shah ke bill pesh ke karne ke baad congress netaa anand sharma ne is bill ke virodh main sadan main apana paksh rakhaa
 BJP leader JP Nadda spoke in favor of the bill, while TMC leader Derek o'brien opposed the bill
 landan main patrakaron se baatcheet ke dauraan bharat main badhati ashishnutaa ko lekar puche gaye prashn par pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bilkul thik kaha ki yah desh buddha or gandhi kaa he, yahaan kisi bhi tarah kii choti-badi ghatana bardaasht nahin kii jaaegi
 But this answer needs to be analyzed properly as it gives some clue to the Prime Minister's subconscious perceptions of intolerance
 aisa lagata he, jaise pradhanmantri ashishnutaa kii shuruyaat tab maanate hai, jab koi ‘ghatana’ hoti he, masalan kahin kisi dadri se saath saal kii umr ko choote ek buudhe ko sirf gomance rakhane ke shaq main maar diya jaataa he, yaa phir kahin dharwar main 78 saal ke ek lekhak ko ghar main dastak dekar goli maar di jaati he
 With this view, the matter of 'intolerance' suddenly becomes very simple - then it can be given a valid figure that even if one or two or four-five such incidents happen in a country with a population of 1
25 billion, then it is absolutely negligible
 And our index of tolerance is still very high, the countries surrounded by various types of terror do not even stand around us
 maansikta kii jagah ghatnaon ke zarie sahishnutaa maapne kaa yah paimaana pradhanmantri se pehle ataali gaanv ke dangaiyon ne bhi apanaaya tha, jab unhone yaad dilaayaa ki alpsankhyakon kaa unka virodh kitna ahimsak rahaa he, ki usamen ek bhi alpsankhyak maaraa nahin gaya, kisi mahila ke saath balaatkaar nahin hua, bas unke ghar jalaae gaye or unhen gaanv chhodkar bhaagna padaa
 Similarly, Shiv Sena blackened the face of Sudhindra Kulkarni in Maharashtra and also called it his non-violent and tolerant resistance, because there was no violence in it either
 sahishnutaa or ahimsa kaa yah bhaajapai bhashya darasal sar kisi kaa nahin katata, magar gardan par sabaki talwaar latakaae rakhata he
 Against a worn-out version of tradition, if you say something against a superficial form of superstition, anyone's feelings can be hurt and it can range from being threatened with death to being executed
 is sahishnutaa kaa shikaar aksar itihaas bhi hota he jisaki aadhi-adhuri samaj se las ativaadee aapke itihaas-bodh ko laanat bhejte hai, uske liye videshiyon dwaara die gaye gyaan ko zimmedaar bataate hai or kalpana karte hai ki kisi din ve itihaas kaa apana or bhartiya bhashya pesh karenge
 The comments baharhaal, british patrkaar ne bhartiya pradhanmantri se badhati ashishnutaa par sawaal poocha tha, yah nahin poocha tha ki bharat main sahishnutaa kii parampara he yaa nahin
 It is a tradition and is so deep, detailed and well known that it does not need the testimony of Narendra Modi
 sangh parivaar ko bhi is parampara ke aage sir jhukaana padataa he or narendra modi bhi gandhi or buddha ke hawaale se apana bachaav kar pate hai
 The question was not on the tradition of Gandhi and Buddha, but on the attempt to hurt this tradition
 jis vichaardhaara ne gandhi kii hatya kii or jo in dinon godse kii murtiyon lagavane main lagi hui he, vah maujuuda hukumat ke saath he or maujuuda hukumat bhi uske saath he- isamen kisi ko andeh nahin he
 The compassion that Buddha's philosophy demands is not possible in this extremism
 kaayade se british patrkaar kii baat kaa jawaab vahi hota jo narendra modi ne diya- bharat main sahishnutaa kii parampara bani rahegi
 But not because the existing power is in favor of maintaining it, but because this tradition is so strong, so deeply entrenched that it is not possible to end it
 log uske liye shahadat dene ko taiyaar hai
 Writers and thinkers like Govind Pansare, Narendra Dabholkar or MM Kalburgi martyred to save this tradition
 jin lekhakon, vaigyanikon, kalakaaron or filmkaaron ne apane sammaan lautaae, apni ore se pradarshan kiye, darasal ve isi sahishnu or bahultavaadi parampara kaa bachaav kar rahe the
 Of course, the tradition of intolerance is being tested and is also being taken these days
 lekin sahishnutaa modi kaa peechha chhodti hi nahin, vah ek sawaal kii shakl main landan tak ja pahunchati he or unhen yaad karne ko vivash karti he ki yah gandhi or buddha kaa desh he
 But this answer needs to be analyzed properly as it gives some clue to the Prime Minister's subconscious perceptions of intolerance

 lekin sahishnutaa modi kaa peechha chhodti hi nahin, vah ek sawaal kii shakl main landan tak ja pahunchati he or unhen yaad karne ko vivash karti he ki yah gandhi or buddha kaa desh he
 This measure of tolerance through events instead of mentality was also adopted by the rioters of Atali village before the Prime Minister, when he reminded how non-violent their opposition to minorities has been, that not a single minority was killed in it, with a woman Rape did not happen, just their houses were burnt and they had to flee the village
 isi tarah shivasena ne maharashtra main sudhindra kulkarni kaa munh kaala kar ise bhi apana ahimsak or sahishnu pratirodh bataaya tha, kyonki isamen bhi hinsa nahin hui
 This bjp-like comment of tolerance and non-violence does not actually cut anyone's head, but hangs everyone's sword on the neck
 parampara ke kisi ghise-pite sanskaran ke viruddh, andhvishwaas ke kisi satahi swaroop ke kilaaf agar aapane kuch kaha to kisi kii bhi bhaavana aahat ho sakati he or maut kii dhamkee dene se lekar us par amal tak kiya ja saktaa he
 The victim of this tolerance is also often a history whose extremists, equipped with half-baked understanding, send a damn to your history, for this, they are responsible for the knowledge given by foreigners and imagine that someday they will own history and Indian Will present the commentary
 tippaniyan However, the British journalist had questioned the Indian Prime Minister on increasing intolerance, not asking whether India has a tradition of tolerance
 yah parampara he or itani gahari, vistrut or sarvavidit he ki isko kisi narendra modi kii gavaahi kii zarurat nahin
 The Sangh Parivar also has to bow to this tradition and Narendra Modi is also able to defend himself by handing over Gandhi and Buddha
 sawaal gandhi or buddha kii parampara par nahin, is parampara ko chot pahunchane kii koshish par tha
 The ideology that assassinated Gandhi and who these days is engaged in erecting statues of Godse, is with the current government and the current government is also with him - no doubt
 buddha kaa darshan jis karunaa kii maang karata he, vah is atvaad main sambhav hi nahin
 Ideally, the answer of the British journalist would have been the same that Narendra Modi gave - the tradition of tolerance will continue in India
 lekin isliye nahin ki maujuuda satta use banaae rakhane kii pakshdhar he, balki isliye ki yah parampara itani majboot he, itane gahare dhansi hui he ki use khatm karnaa sambhav nahin he
 People are willing to sacrifice for him
 govind pansre, narendra dabholkar yaa mem kalburgi jaise lekhakon or vichaarkon ne isi parampara ko bachaane ke liye shahadat di
 Writers, scientists, artists and filmmakers who returned their honors performed on their behalf, defending this tolerant and pluralistic tradition
 beshak, jo ashishnutaa kii parampara he vah iskaa imtihaan leti rahati he or in dinon bhi le rahi he
 But tolerance does not leave the pursuit of Modi, it reaches London in the form of a question and forces them to remember that this is the country of Gandhi and Buddha
 sahishnutaa or ahimsa kaa yah bhaajapai bhashya darasal sar kisi kaa nahin katata, magar gardan par sabaki talwaar latakaae rakhata he
 Against a worn-out version of tradition, if you say something against a superficial form of superstition, anyone's feelings can be hurt and it can range from being threatened with death to being executed
 is sahishnutaa kaa shikaar aksar itihaas bhi hota he jisaki aadhi-adhuri samaj se las ativaadee aapke itihaas-bodh ko laanat bhejte hai, uske liye videshiyon dwaara die gaye gyaan ko zimmedaar bataate hai or kalpana karte hai ki kisi din ve itihaas kaa apana or bhartiya bhashya pesh karenge

 jin lekhakon, vaigyanikon, kalakaaron or filmkaaron ne apane sammaan lautaae, apni ore se pradarshan kiye, darasal ve isi sahishnu or bahultavaadi parampara kaa bachaav kar rahe the
 Of course, the tradition of intolerance is being tested and is also being taken these days
 lekin sahishnutaa modi kaa peechha chhodti hi nahin, vah ek sawaal kii shakl main landan tak ja pahunchati he or unhen yaad karne ko vivash karti he ki yah gandhi or buddha kaa desh he
 However, the British journalist had questioned the Indian Prime Minister on increasing intolerance, not asking whether India has a tradition of tolerance
 yah parampara he or itani gahari, vistrut or sarvavidit he ki isko kisi narendra modi kii gavaahi kii zarurat nahin
 The Sangh Parivar also has to bow to this tradition and Narendra Modi is also able to defend himself by handing over Gandhi and Buddha
 sawaal gandhi or buddha kii parampara par nahin, is parampara ko chot pahunchane kii koshish par tha
 The ideology that assassinated Gandhi and who these days is engaged in erecting statues of Godse, is with the current government and the current government is also with him - no doubt
 buddha kaa darshan jis karunaa kii maang karata he, vah is atvaad main sambhav hi nahin
 Ideally, the answer of the British journalist would have been the same that Narendra Modi gave - the tradition of tolerance will continue in India
 lekin isliye nahin ki maujuuda satta use banaae rakhane kii pakshdhar he, balki isliye ki yah parampara itani majboot he, itane gahare dhansi hui he ki use khatm karnaa sambhav nahin he
 People are willing to sacrifice for him
 govind pansre, narendra dabholkar yaa mem kalburgi jaise lekhakon or vichaarkon ne isi parampara ko bachaane ke liye shahadat di
 Writers, scientists, artists and filmmakers who returned their honors performed on their behalf, defending this tolerant and pluralistic tradition
 beshak, jo ashishnutaa kii parampara he vah iskaa imtihaan leti rahati he or in dinon bhi le rahi he
 But tolerance does not leave the pursuit of Modi, it reaches London in the form of a question and forces them to remember that this is the country of Gandhi and Buddha
 kaayade se british patrkaar kii baat kaa jawaab vahi hota jo narendra modi ne diya- bharat main sahishnutaa kii parampara bani rahegi
 But not because the existing power is in favor of maintaining it, but because this tradition is so strong, so deeply entrenched that it is not possible to end it
 log uske liye shahadat dene ko taiyaar hai

 After the recently concluded assembly elections, the newly elected governments of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh announced loan waiver of the farmers only a few hours after the swearing-in
 jiske baad assam sarkaar ne karjamaafee kii ghoshnaa kii or gujarat sarkaar ne kisaanon kaa bijli bill maaf karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 So the question arises that what is the ground reality of the governments which have waived farmers' debt till now? It is worth mentioning that during the assembly elections in Punjab, Congress had announced debt waiver
 punjab sarkaar ne charanbaddh tareeke se karjamaafee shuru bhi kar di
 Explain that a total of 10 in Punjab
 5 lakh kisaan parivaar or 20 lakh log kheti se jude hai
 The farmers of the state have a debt of Rs 8 xxrep 4 0 crore
 congress ne apane chunavi ghoshnaptr main punjab ke kisaanon kii sampurna karjamaafee kaa vaayada to kiya tha lekin sarkaar banaate hi vah apane vaayade se palat gai or sirf 2 lakh rupee tak ke karj maaf karne kii yojana shuru kii
 Punjab government during its 21 months of term so far
4
 27 lakh kisaanon ke 3586 karod rupee ke karj maaf kar chuki he
 Whereas, more than 2,69752 remaining farmers selected for the scheme will be waived in the third and fourth phases of the scheme
 khaamiyon se bhari he punjab sarkaar kii karjamafipunjab sarkaar kii rin maafee yojana vipaksh ke gale nahin utar rahi
 According to the leaders of the Shiromani Akali Dal, the main opposition party, the number of farmers selected for the loan waiver scheme is very less
 kyonki zyaadaatar kisaanon ke karj kii raashi do lakh rupee se adhik he
 According to the opposition, the loan waiver scheme of the Punjab government is fraught with many flaws
 sarkaar sirf sahakaari or rashtriyakrut bainkon se liye gaye karj hi maaf kar rahi he
 While most farmers have taken loans from private moneylenders
 jise maaf karne kii philhal koi yojana sarkaar ke paas nahin he
 According to Akali Dal spokesperson and general secretary Dr Daljit Cheema, the Congress government of the state has cheated the farmers in the name of loan waiver
 do lakh rupee tak kaa karj ho rahaa mafaudhar congress netaaon kaa maananaa he ki sarkaar ne kharaab mali haalat ke chalate kisaanon ke us varg ko chunaa, jisamen se zyaadaatar log khudakushi kar rahe the
 State government so far 4 in two phases
 27 lakh kisaanon ke karj maaf kar chuki he
 The state government had made a provision of Rs 14734 crore in the current budget for loan waiver, out of which Rs 3586 crore has been spent
 congress pravaktaa jagpal singh abulkhurana ke mutabik sarkaar shuruyaat main 2 lakh rupee tak ke rin maaf karegi or uske baad usase adhik karj vaale kisaanon ke rin maaf karne par vichaar karegi
 Crop loan waiver not in the interest of farmers; Professor Pramod Kumar, director of the Institute for Development and Communication, does not consider loan waiver correct
 unka maananaa he ki kisaanon ko sahukaaron ke changul se bachaane ke liye unke liye pension or saamaajik suraksha kii yojanaayen shuru karne kii jarurat he
 So that he does not take loan from moneylenders or bank when needed
 professor pramod kumaar ke mutabik kisaanon ke karj maaf karne se unka koi bhala nahin hone vaala
 Because the income of farmers is constantly falling and until their income doubles, they will be forced to borrow
 centre sarkaar kii mahatvakankshi atal ayushmaan yojana ko nijee aspataal or doctor palitha lagane main jute hai
 So far 12 such private hospitals have been listed which have fraudulently committed crores of rupees
 isamen 52 lakh kaa bhugtan sarkaar kar chuki he or lagbhag 52 lakh kaa hi bhugtan baaki he
 Two of these hospitals have been excluded from the list, while 10 hospitals are under investigation
 garibon ko 5 lakh rupee tak kaa muft ilaaj dene ke liye modi sarkaar ne atal ayushmaan yojana kaa shubharambh kiya
 But some hospitals are doing the work of defrauding the government along with robbing the rights of the people
 atal ayushmaan yojana ke apper nideshak kii maane to do aspataalon par karrwai karte hue suchi se hataa diya gaya he jabaki farjivada ke chalate 10 anya aspataalon ko notice jari kiye ja chuke hai
 Further action will be taken only after the hospitals respond
 koi bhi varg yaa tabaka ilaaj se vanchit na rahe, iske liye centre sarkaar ne atal ayushmaan yojana ko shuru kiya
 But due to the fraud of private hospitals, the right of people has been taken away, as well as misuse of government money
 ab tak farjivada karne vaale aspataalon se koi penalty or jurmaana nahin liya gaya he, jabaki 52 lakh kaa bhugtan bhi aspataalon ko kar diya gaya he or 52 lakh kaa bhugtan abhi shesh bhi he
 According to Additional Director of Atal Ayushman, the final decision has not been taken on 10 hospitals
 aspataalon se jawaab maanga gaya he, jiske baad hi aage kii karrwai kii jaaegi
 Couldn't be happier traveling back home now with this trophy in my hands

" pradhanmantri narendra modi ke indonesia daure kii vajah se indonesia se judi tamaam khabaren ain, lekin soshal media par ek aisi khabar bhi viral hui jisko dekhakar log chakkar main pad gaye ki kya sachmuch aisa he? in khabaron main daawa kiya gaya he ki puri tarah se muslim bahulya desh hone ke baavjood indonesia ke karency note main bhagwaan ganesh kii photo chhapi hui he
 In the news being shared on social media, a note from Indonesia is also being shown which is of 20,000 and on which Ganesh's photo actually appears
 note main ganesh ji ke saath ek bujurg vyakti ke photo bhi dikhti he
 If you start searching Indonesian notes on Google, then the 20,000 notes you will see are completely different from this and Ganesh ji does not appear anywhere
 lekin ganesh ji vaale note kii or khojbin karne ke liye jab hamane bank of indonesia kii website par dekha to yah note hamen dikh gaya
 Information given on the website revealed that this note was issued by the Indonesian government in 1998
 ganesh ji vaale 20,000 ke note par chape hue vyakti kaa naam 'kii hajaar deventra' he jo indonesia ke swatantraaa senaanee the or jinhone shiksha ke kshetra main kaaphi kaam kiya tha
 In 1945 he was also the Education Minister of Indonesia
 note main peeche kii taraf class room dikhaae gaye hai kyonki yah note shiksha kii theme par hi chapa gaya tha
 But the 20,000-rupee Indonesian note with a photo of Ganeshji closed in late 2008 after being in circulation for 10 years
 indonesia puri tarah se muslim desh he jahaan par hinduon kii aabaadi 2% se bhi kam he
 In such a situation, the question arises that why the Government of Indonesia had printed the photo of Ganesh ji on the note? Very few people know that despite being a Muslim majority country, the number of Hindus is very large in Indonesia
 aapako yah jaanakar hairaani hogi ki bharat, nepal or bangladesh ke baad indonesia hi vah desh he jahaan sabase zyada hindu rahete hai
 Balinese Hindus make up more than 80 percent of the population in Bali, Indonesia, and there are thousands of small and large temples
 sirf do pratishat hindu aabaadi hone ke baavjood indonesia kii samskruti main hindu devi devataaon ko sammaan miltaa rahaa he
 An airline operates in Indonesia named after Garuda, called the vehicle of Lord Vishnu
 indonesia main ganesh, krishna or hanuman ke saath-saath pandavon ke naam par dak tikat bhi jari ho chuke hai
 Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, also houses a huge statue called Arjuna Vivah which depicts the scene of the Mahabharata
 indonesia kaa neshnal amblem bhi garud pankasheel kehalaata he
 The logo of Lord Ganesha is also on the logo of Bandung Institute of Technology, a prestigious engineering college in Indonesia
 yahi nahin america main indonesia ke duutavas ke baahar bhi vidya kii devi saraswati kii ek vishaal murti lagaai gai he
 As far as putting a photo of Ganesha on the 20,000 note is concerned, people have different opinions about it
 aisa bhi mana jaataa he ki ganesh buddhi ke devtaa hai or unhone vyas ji ke kehane par apane daant se hi mahabharat likh diya tha
 That is why they are also called Ekadanta
 indonesia ke jis 20,000 ke note par bhagwaan ganesh kii photo bani he uskaa theme shiksha he or ho saktaa he isiilie ganesh ji kii photo chhapane kaa faisla kiya gaya ho
 But there is also another interesting fact related to the photo of Lord Ganesha on Indonesian note
 1997 main asia kii aarthik mandi ke dauraan indonesia samet kai deshon ke mudra kii keemat bahut zyada gir gai thi
 During this time, Indonesia's currency also fell so low against the dollar that there was a severe economic crisis in the country
 ise sanyog kaha ja saktaa he lekin yah baat sach he ki 1998 main 20,000 ke note par ganesh ji kii photo chhapane ke baad agle saal 1999 main hi indonesia kii aarthik haalat or vahaan kii mudra kii sthiti main teji se sudhaar hua tha
 In the viral test, after the photo of Ganesh was printed on the note of Indonesia, it came out right, although this note is no longer in circulation

 India has once again reiterated support for the independent Palestine nation, amid US efforts to disrupt the Palestinian effort to gain membership in the United Nations

 Puri said that after addressing the UN General Assembly on Friday, Abbas is likely to inform the UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon that the Palestine administration is ready to assume responsibility for a nation
 puri ne kaha ki abbaas ko is baat ke liye raji karne ke prayaas bhi jari hai ki vah is samay sanyukt raashtra kii purna sadsyta ke liye na to mahasabha se sampark karen or na sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad se hi
 Meanwhile, efforts are on to start a direct dialogue between Israel and Palestine
 puri ne kaha ki sanyukt raashtra main ab tak samarthan main hue bhaashanon ke baad philstin ke liye bahut vikalp nahin bachaa he
 If the matter comes before the Security Council, the US will also prefer not to use the veto
 lekin koi vikalp na bachane kii surat main lagata he ki vah is kadam par vito kaa istemaal karne ko taiyaar rahegaa
 Puri said that India is the first non-arab country to recognize Palestine, which has been supporting it since 1988
 unhone kaha ki manmohan singh ne apane patr main doharaaya he ki bharat philstin kaa samarthan karegaa
 Puri said in response to a question, "india's support to Palestine is 100 percent clear
 " unhone kaha ki yadi is mudde par matdaan hua to bharat mahasabha or suraksha parishad main iske paksh main vot karegaa
 Puri said, "india came under some pressure on the question of Palestine, there is no question of that

 Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik, who is facing criticism for his comments about the demolition of the Babri Masjid, said on Saturday that he never compared the demolition of the 16th century mosque to the 2008 terror attack in Mumbai
 malik ne kaha ki babari masjid dhahaae jane or mumbai hamale ke bich koi tulana nahin he
 The Babri Masjid is associated with the religion
 (jo kuch hua) vah sampradayik vivaad tha
 Malik, who is on a three-day visit to India, said that Pakistan itself is a victim of communal conflict
 pakistan main shiya sunni sangharsh hote rahete hai
 Malik said, 'my intention was not to create any confusion but to warn both countries
 ’ unhone kaha ki vah is tarah ke vyakti nahin hai ki kisi ke majahab yaa antardhamon’ ke maamle main hastkshep karen
 He is a person who will be at the forefront of communal harmony issues
 malik ne kaha ki america main hue aatankwaadi hamale, queta kii ghatnaayen, hamaare shiya sunni logon ke karachi main maare jane jaisi ghatnaayen ho rahi hai
 He said, 'I also said that incidents like Mumbai blasts, Babri Masjid case, i am repeating and please do not take it negatively
 ham nahin chaahate ki is tarah kii chijen bharat or pakistan ke kisi kshetra main hon
 The Pakistani minister on Friday compared the demolition of the Babri Masjid with the Mumbai terror attack and created a controversy
 malik ne kaha ki akasar majahabi hinsa se ugravad paidaa hota he or ise rokane ke harsambhav prayaas hone chahie
 He said that we should take every step that would lead to harmony
 ham rashtrahit ke sabhi upaay kar sakate hai
 So that the militants, terrorists, our enemies do not get any chance to work against us, therefore both countries should work together for this
 malik ne kaha, ‘main kisi ko takalif nahin pahunchaana chahta
 So, i want to say that whatever issues we have, the Prime Minister also raised them, we will resolve them jointly
 hamen is kshetra (bharat or pakistan) se aatankwaad ke safaye ke liye har kshetra main milakar kaam karnaa chahie
 The Babri Masjid was demolished on 6 December 1992, after which communal frenzy spread across the country, especially in Mumbai
 malik ne kaha tha, ‘ham nahin chaahate ki koi 9 / 11 ho
 We do not want a Mumbai blast
 ham nahin chaahate koi samjhauta express maamla ho
 We do not want any Babri Masjid issue, and we can work together to bring peace to not only India and Pakistan but the entire region

 Many analysts believe that Modi's inclusion in the Parliamentary Board is the first step in nominating him as a formal candidate for the post of Prime Minister
 guuruuvaar ko modi ne is bayaan ke jariye ishaaron-ishaaron main saaf kar diya ki vah pradhanmantri pad kii daavedaari ke liye taiyaar hai
 On Modi's statement, Congress leader and Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari retorted that he feared that Narendra Modi's intention may not be to do everything in the entire country that (communal riots) he (modi) has spent the year
 Was commissioned in 2002 in Gujarat
 duusari taraf, modi ke is bayaan par endie ke ghatak dal jediu ke netaa shivanand tiwari ne kataaksh karte hue kaha ki jab koi rajaneta is tarah kii baaten kahata he, to uske peeche dilli kii kursi kii uski aakanksha jhalkati he
 Tiwari said that let's see who Delhi likes after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 desh kii seva to gujarat main rahakar bhi ho sakati he
 
 
 It is noteworthy that JDU has been against Modi's candidature for the post of PM since the beginning and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has made public statements about it many times
 gauratlab he ki guuruuvaar ko gandhinagar main gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ne kaha tha ki har bachche kaa kartavya he ki vah bharat mata kaa karj chukaaye
 Modi said, not only Modi but every child and citizen has a debt towards Mother India
 
 
 yah uskaa kartavya he ki jab bhi avasar aae, vah use chukaaye
 Modi made this political commentary in response to the statement of author RP Gupta during a book release ceremony
 lekhak ne kaha tha, modiji ne gujarat kaa karj chukaa diya he, abhi bharat maa kaa karj chukaana he
 The comments modi ne kaha, ek doctor kisi kii jaan bachaakar bharat mata ke prati apana karj chukaata he
 
 
 a teacher does this by teaching children
 rashtriya raajnneeti main badi bhoomika nibhaane ke liye taiyaar hone kaa saaf sanket dete hue modi ne kaha, har kisi ko yah rin chukaana he

 sawaliapaki raay main narendra modi ne khud ko kis bhartiya pradhanmantri ke saanche main dhaala he?javabalpani party ke purvavarti atal bihari vaajapeyi ke saanche main to katai nahin
 It is yet to be decided that Modi, who has completed one-third of his term, matches which Prime Minister
 centre sarkaar ke bajet kii taiyaariyon ke dauraan or 29 farvari ko uske sansad main pesh kiye jane ke baad unke or indira gandhi ke bich ajeebogareeb samanthaayen dekhi ja rahi hai
 The similarities lie not only in their way of working (both are considered autocratic) and their charisma (both of which have given their parties famous victories on the basis of their personal popularity), but also in being surrounded by difficulties But how both their enemies and the style of deciding their priorities is very similar
 indira gandhi us “videshi haath” ke bare main hallaa machaati thim, jo lagaataar unki gaddi ko hilaane kii sajishein karata tha, to bajet ke hafte bhar pehle modi ne bhi videshi rakam se chalane vaale un enjio ko aade haathon liya jinka “makasad modi ko khatm karnaa he
 When Indira Gandhi's leadership was challenged after the Congress split in 1969, she announced "garibi Hatao", the largest anti-poverty program since independence
 isane gaanvon or shaharon ke garibon main sidhe apni paith banane main unki madad kii or unhone 1971 kaa aam chunaav baari jansamarthan ke saath jeeta tha
 His 20-point program included the Vishal Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, drinking water to all villages and electricity to villages
 haal ke rajya vidhansabha chunaavon main apni party kii haar ke baad lagaataar asurakshit jaan padate or dhimi padati arthvyavastha, gaanvon kii kharaab mali haalat, niryaat main tej giravat, amiron kii samarthak hone ke liye unki sarkaar kii tikhi aalochana or desh main badhati naagarik uthalputhal se ghire modi ne kuch myanon main indira gandhi ko bhi peeche chhod diya he
 In the 2016 budget, he has sacrificed the highest amount so far with both hands on farming and farming programs
 isse unhen ummid he ki bhartiya arthvyavastha or bhi tej raftaar vruddhi ke raste par chal padegi or unhen doosraa kaarykaal bhi jita degi
 In doing so, Modi has also tried to get rid of the suit of the suit-boot government that Rahul Gandhi had put on him
 isaki jagah unhone khud ko garib-gurbon or dabe-kuchlon ke nae maseehaa ke taur par pesh karte hue dhoti kurte kii chhavi dhaaran karne kaa jatan kiya he
 The Prime Minister has also re-established himself as a "development man", but he has to prepare the Sangh Parivar to rein in his divisive agenda, which in recent times has made this agenda even more enthusiastic
 Is implementing sarkaar or congress, party donon ko apni manmarjee ke mutabik chalaane vaali indira gandhi se ek fark yah he ki modi ko sarkari faislon main sangh ke badhate dakhal se nibatna pad rahaa he
 To be fair, there are other differences than the style of Indira Gandhi, who is suited to Modi
 bainkon sahit ahm kshetron kaa rashtriyakaran karte hue ve samaajwaad ke raste par kahin zyada aage chali gai thim, vahiin modi sanbhal-sanbhalkar madhya maarg par bad rahe hai
 That is why the Prime Minister has decided to invest huge amount in building infrastructure, especially in roads and houses, while pouring huge amount in eradicating poverty
 khaadya prasanskaran kshetra main 100 fisadi epadi ko manjuuri dekar, nijee gas utpaadan ko protsaahan dekar or sadak yatayaat kshetra ko rukaawaton or paabandiyon se mukt karke unhone yah bhi ishaara kiya he ki ve arthvyavastha ko udaar banane ke raste par date rahenge
 As far as taxes are concerned, they have not given any relief to the corporate sector, but the budget has simplified the procedures of taxation and dispute settlement and cleared all the doubts about taxation from the previous date, "tax Terrorism"
 Has finished
 ahm yah he ki modi sarkaar ne chautarafa kai kaaryakramon or kshetron main khule haath se dhan jhonka he, iske baad bhi usne ghate ke lakshyon ko puraa karte hue rajkoshiya anushaasan kaayam rakhaa he
 Says the Finance Ministry official, "with this decision, the budget announcements were popularized rather than populist
 ”rajkoshiya samajhadaari kaa yah faisla sarkaar ke bheetar garmagarm bahes ke baad liya gaya
 Some of the Prime Minister's key advisers had told him to keep the fiscal restrictions on hold as an undeserved legacy of the past and spend both hands on programs irrespective of anything
 dusron ne unhen aagaah kiya
 One officer said this way, "it would have been like this that India would have decided overnight without any preparation that now all cars should have steering wheel on the left side
" ”modi samajhadaari baratane ke haq main jhuk gaye or unhone baarik santulan saadhaa
 This decision gave confidence to investors from all over the world and after presenting the budget, the stock market showed a boom again
 videsh mantralay ke ek varisht afasar kehete hai, “shuruyaat main garibi hataane ke kaaryakramon par itnaa jor dekhakar meraa to dil hi baith gaya tha, jab buniyadi dhaanche main nivesh, karon se jude upayon or rajkoshiya sanyam vaali baaten padhi gayi, to main fouran samaj gaya ki videshi niveshkon ne chaiyn kii saans lee hogi
 They will unite with India
 unhen or zyada kii ummid rahi hogi, par ve shikaayat nahin kar sakate
 "it was evident that the Prime Minister himself had an impression on the entire budget
 unhone vibhinn vibhaagon ke saath 10 baithken kin or jor die jane vaale harek ahm kshetra kii ek-ek yojana kii nijee taur par padtaal kii
 Whether it is agricultural sector or rural area or education, health, energy, transport or tax sector
 vahaan maujuud ek varisht afasar ne kaha ki modi ko ehsaas tha ki vaishvik maahaul main gairmamuli uthalputhal machi he, vishwa arthvyavastha dagamagaa rahi he or bhavishya ke utaar-chadhaavon se bhartiya arthvyavastha kii kilabandi kerani hogi
 He also realized that low oil prices helped fill the treasury of his government, but these conditions could not be sustained forever
 modi ne afasaron se kaha, “ham vaishvik sankat kaa apane upar asar padane kaa intjaar na karen, isaki bajaae ham aage badhkar aise upaay karen jisase vah asar kam se kam pade
 The Prime Minister also expressed concern over the disturbance of villages in important states of the country due to two consecutive crop failures and stressed the need for relief
 bajet par charchaaon ke dauraan unhone saaf kar diya ki kheti or gramin vikaas par dhyaan diya janaa chahie or iske alaava aarthik vruddhi ko oochaal dene ke liye buniyadi dhaanche main baari saarvajanik nivesh hona chahie
 They knew that the manufacturing sector was faltering, exports were falling and domestic private investment was also eroding
 isliye unhone or tej tathaa oonchi aarthik vruddhi ke liye bade paimaane par sarkari rakam jhonkne par daanv lagane kaa faisla kiya
 Says a senior officer, "to give the necessary impetus to the economy, the Prime Minister is relying on increasing growth beyond demand and consumption, while maintaining fiscal restraint
 par unako yah bhi saaf tha ki paisa sampatti nirmaan main, masalan sadakon main, laganaa chahie jiskaa asar lagaataar badhata jayega
 "his government's hopes are also based on the fact that it has rarely happened that crops have been bad for three consecutive years
 isliye modi kii team ko ummid he ki is saal monsoon acha rahegaa
 This will increase the possibility of further rapid growth in the economy
 bajet ke baad is par bahut bahes ho rahi he ki sudhaaron kaa vaada karke or “sarkaar ko kaarobaar ke maamle main nahin padana chahie” sareekhe daawey karke satta main aae pradhanmantri apane raste se bhatak gaye hai
 His critics accuse him of adopting a policy of slowly moving forward, relying on massive public investment to slow disinvestment and accelerate growth
 jaahir taur par modi vam yaa dakshin hone kii paramparaagat vicharadharatmak badebandi ke haq main nahin hai
 To his colleagues, he says, "I will make money and distribute it
" ”apni aarthik niti modi ne pichley saal hi saaf kar di thi, jab unhone ek kaarykram main kaha tha, “bade kaam karne or choti-choti chijen karne main aapas main koi virodh nahin he
 One of these methods is through new policies, programs, large projects, and changes that change the way
 duusare main ahmiyat vaali choti-choti chizon par dhyaan dena hota he, jan andolan khadaa karnaa hota he or janaveg paidaa karnaa hota he, jo phir vikaas ko aage badhaata he
 We need to walk both ways
 ”2016 ke bajet main unhone in donon raaston ke bich behatar santulan saadhaa he
 And he did not hesitate to embrace and reform the policies of the previous government, just as he has done with Aadhaar and MNREGA
 unhone apane ek sahyogi se kaha tha, “meri aarthik duuradrushti vruddhi or vikaas he or main tab tak chaiyn nahin luungaa jab tak ki aane vaale saalon main ham jidipi main do-ankon kii vruddhi hasil nahin kar lete
 a few hours after the Union Budget was tabled in Parliament, Modi called his senior officers in the PMO and told them, "the budget is done, now start executing it
" ” pradhanmantri ko acchhee tarah pataa he ki bajet kii bahut kuch kamyaabi yojanaon ke teji se amal par nirbhar karegi, jinka unhone elaan kiya he
 His talk about the red tape of India is quite famous, “people go on Char Dham Yatra to attain salvation in life
 sarkaar main ek file ko chhattis dham kii yatra kerani padati he or phir bhi moksh nahin miltaa
 "now that he is seated on the driving seat himself, he should leave no stone unturned to bring economic salvation to India

 Petrol prices in the country rose to Rs 80 per liter and diesel to Rs 67 per liter due to rising crude oil prices globally
 vahiin global market main mangalvaar ko crude oil 70 dollar prati bairal ke paar nikal gaya
 This level of crude oil precedes the dramatic fall in 2014, which means that crude prices have crossed the almost three-year-old high
 aise main ek baar phir kayaas laganaa shuru ho gaya he ki kya isse pehle vaishvik str par crude oil 100 dollar prati bairal ke paar pahunche desh main petrol kii keemat 100 rupee prati litre ke paar nikal jaaegi?global market main crude oil ke liye saal 2012 se 2017 tak kaa safar desh kii raajnneeti ke liye gemeanger sabit ho chukaa he
 Global crude oil prices increased the challenges of the previous Congress government so much that in 2014 the government had to face defeat in the elections on the issue of inflation
 vahiin 2014 main chunaav ke nateezon aate hi kendra main bani nai bijepi sarkaar ke liye global crude oil kii keemten vardaan sabit hui
 Amidst the ups and downs during this period, the price of crude oil fell from $ 125 per barrel to $ 30 per barrel in the global market, while the price of petrol in the country went from Rs 76 to Rs 56 per liter
 ab ek baar phir global market main crude kii keemton main sudhaar hona shuru ho chukaa he
 Modi government got boon of cheap petrol During the tenure of Manmohan Singh government in 2012, crude oil reached $ 125 per barrel in the international market and remained constant at $ 100 per barrel till the 2014 general elections
 april 2014 main chunaav hue or crude kii keemton main phislan kii bhi shuruyaat hui
 This slippery, which began in May 2014, soon after the election results brought down the price of crude from $ 100 a barrel to $ 50 a barrel by December 2015
 yah phislan yaheen nahin khatm hoti
 Crude oil prices fell to their all-time low of $ 30 a barrel by January 2016
 gauratlab he ki kachche tel kii keemten kendra sarkaar ke khajaane se kharch kaa sabase bada or sabase ahm kharch he
 Here, every penny left is used for the government to pursue its economic and social policies
 ise padhein: aarthik surveykshan: GDP ko notebandi, crude oil kii keemton se sabase bada khatrapahele se kitna badal chuke hai halaat?desh main petrol kii keemat nirdhaarit karne kaa niyam badal chukaa he
 Where previously, the price of petrol was determined every two months by adding tax along with estimation of import cost per month
 iske baad is formule par petrol kii keemat prati maah or phir prati saptaah nirdhaarit kii jane lagi
 But for the past few months, the price of petrol per day is determined by the fluctuations of crude oil in the global market and the assessment of tax in the country
 lihaaja in teen saal ke dauraan crude kii keemton main baari pherbadal se petrol kii keemat main bhi utaar-chadhaav kaa silsilaa bana rahaa he
 In 2014, the common man's first slippage of crude slippage began in 2015
 jahaan crude 30 dollar prati bairal ke str par pahunch gaya tha vahiin dilli main prati litre petrol kii keemat pehali baar 60 rupee prati litre ke neeche gai
 However, the price of petrol ranged from Rs 66 to Rs 60 per liter throughout the year
 2016 main oktober tak saste petrol kaa khel khatm ho gaya or yahaan se ek baar phir petrol kii keemton main badhottaree shuru ho gai
 During this time, the price of one liter of petrol rose from Rs 66 to Rs 70 and during 2017, petrol price again went up from Rs 70 per liter to Rs 63 per liter
 ab 2018 kii shuruyaat main ek baar phir crude oil kii keemton main ijapha hone laga he or vaishvik str par jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki aane vaale dinon main badhati keemton se viksit ho rahi arthvyavasthaaon ko nuksaan hona shuru ho jayega
 When the price of crude reached $ 150, the global organization Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) predicted that in the current global economic situation, the price of crude oil could go up to $ 270 per barrel by 2020
 gauratlab he ki 2008 main crude oil abtak ke sarvaadhik str 145 dollar prati bairal par thi
 At the same time, the price of crude oil reached $ 30 per barrel due to ongoing dispute in Gulf countries during 2015 and 2016 and lack of demand in developing countries including China
 oisidi kii yah bhavishyavaanee kaa aadhaar he ki aane vaale varshon main china or bharat jaisi arthvyavasthaaen raftaar pakadaney ke liye indhan ke maang main bada ijapha kar sakati he
 Read this: Know what the impact of Budget 2018's speech will have on the stock market! Petrol will be 100 rupees a liter even without $ 100 crude? In order to cross the 100 rupees price of petrol in India, crude oil does not necessarily touch this level
 beete teen saal tak desh main crude kii keemat or kendra or rajya sarkaron dwaara liya ja rahaa tex petrol kii keemat ko usee samay 100 rupee tak pahunchaa saktaa he jab ek baar phir crude oil 2014 ke str yani 100 dollar prati bairal ko chhu le
 It is noteworthy that GST was implemented in the country in July 2017 but the prices of petrol and diesel were kept out of the GST ambit
 aisa isliye kiya gaya ki petrol-dijal par rajyon dwaara lagaaya ja rahaa tex unke vaarshik revenue kaa bada hissaa he
 After it is brought under GST, it will start selling at a price by levying central tax on petrol and diesel across the country
 kalakaaramir khan, anoushka sharma, saurabh shukla or baman iranidairector:rajkumaar hiraniratin4
 5 Star Amir Khan and Rajkumar Hirani's pairing is a lesser one
 aisa hi kuch 'pike' ke bare main bhi kah sakate hai
 At a time when issues like religion are floating fast in the society
 aise samay main jab dharm ke thekedaar salaakhon ke peeche ja rahe hai
 In a society which is going through a very sensitive sensitivity to religion, the introduction of such films in it really indicates the high thinking of the director, producer and actor
 yah aisi film he, jo aaj ke daur ko bakhubi bayaan karti he
 Strikes off the contractors of religion
 jo bataati he ki yah dar hi he jiske naam par dharm kaa kaarobaar fail rahaa he or ise bakhubi failaayaa ja rahaa he
 PK says that there are two Gods in the society today, one who makes humans and one who creates humans
 or vah sikhaata he ki puja us bhagwaan kii kerani chahie jisane insaan ko banaaya he
 Rajkumar Hirani has proved the fact that the fruit of patience is sweet
 manoranjan ke saath solid sandesh bhi diya ja saktaa he
 How much of an alien (aamir Khan) comes to the earth in the story
 dharti par uske sawaalon ko sun log use pike kehane lagate hai
 He calls the Earth a sphere and makes everything on the test of logic
 uski mulaakaat ek tivi patrkaar (anoushka sharma) se hoti he
 She listens to his story
 pehle yakeen nahin karti or jab yakeen karti he to uske baad kai sachaaiyaan saamne aati hai
 The film has a persecuted TV channel owner (baman Irani) of religious gurus and a hypocritical guru (saurabh Shukla)
 bas, puri film solid kahani lekar chalati he
 In which an attempt is made to remove bigotry and blindness through arguments and reality
 kahin bhi aisa nahin lagata ki bhaashan yaa sandesh dene kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The film has a story
 shuru se lekar ant kar thahaake lagane ke saikadon maukey hai
 Nowhere does the story give the mind a chance to get away from the film
 editing bhi kasaavat bhari he
 The film, My My God, which has blown away the hypocritical babas, has arrived
 pike usee tarah ke sandesh ko lekar chalati he, lekin rajkumaar hiraani ke andaaj main
 Its timing and treatment both make the film completely different
 haalanki donon filmon main koi tulana nahin he
 Star appealamir Khan has proved that whenever he comes with Rajkumar Hirani, he will bring such a cinema, seeing that audiences of every class and age will connect with him
 'pike' aisi hi film or kairactor he
 He comes very easily
 bhojpuri bolte hai or is rang-birangi duniya ko jaanane kii koshish karte hai
 They get so involved in the role that there is fun in every scene
 puri film main vah jaan daale rakhte hai or acting main laajawab
 Anushka Sharma has also given her good support
 sushant singh rajput bhi chote-se role main thik hai
 Saurabh Shukla is cool in the role of the hypocritical Baba and Baman Irani is also fine
 kamai kii batpike ko lekar market main pehle si hi kaaphi hip he
 There is a tremendous craze for this in every audience
 jabardast pre booking he
 Watching the first day and the first show in a single screen theater gives the impression that Aamir can force the audience from front row to balcony to whistle and clap
 film bady bajet or lambey samay se ban rahi thi
 It has already registered tremendous strength
 youth se lekar har aayu varg ke liye behtareen conect he
 The current truth is
 hakeekat dikhaane kii koshish he
 But everything in Rajkumar Hirani style
 phir film kii storiline chhipaakar rakhi gai he, is vajah se jyon-jyon log is film ko dekhenge verde of mouth publicity kaaphi kaam karegi
 Then as one of the spectators coming out was saying, "brother, now even the three o'clock show will have to be seen
 ” a case of cheating has come to light in Bihar, whose revelations have shocked the police of the state
 is maamle main aaropee or peedit donon hi police vaale hai
 In fact, in the name of doubling the money, a police constable made only 60 policemen a victim of fraud
 usne apane sahakarmiyon ko karodon rupaye kii chapat laga di
 The accused has been identified as Sunil Kumar, a 30-year-old police constable
 sunil ne apane kareeb 5 darjan saathiyon ko 4 karod rupee se zyada kaa chuunaa lagaaya he
 For a month, a team of 100 policemen and the victim were searching for accused Sunil day and night
 aaropee consteble ko shuukravaar kii der raat aara se giraftaar kiya gaya
 In this regard, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) of Bhagalpur district Ashish Bharti said that ever since the case was filed against the accused constable, he was absconding
 uski giraftaar ke liye kai police team banaai gai or aakhirkaar use nawada police stesan ilaake se giraftaar kar liya gaya
 The police team enlisted the help of the cyber cell and traced the location of the accused
 darasal, aaropee sunil ke khilaaf bhagalpur jila police main tainaat consteble rajesh kumaar ne ek maah pehle shikaayat darj karai thi ki consteble sunil ne paise dogune karne ke naam par usase 5 lakh rupee thag liye
 After registering the case, the victim policeman Rajesh got information that Sunil had cheated along with many other policemen
 jinamein up nireekshak, sahaayak up-nireekshak or anya aarakshi bhi shaamil hai
 Accused Sunil is accused of cheating Rs 4 crore in Bhagalpur and Navagachia
 police ab usase poochtacha kar rahi he
 Consider this terrible fear
 ek aadmi jise echivi aids kaa sankraman he, ilaaj ke liye dentist ke paas jaataa he
 While treating him, the infection reaches the doctor and then from that dentist, the infection reaches someone who has reached him to treat his teeth
 aisa tab hota he, jab ilaaj main istemaal sui sankramit ho or vah upachaar ke dauraan tut jaae
 In the language of medical science, it is called cross infection and these days the dentist community of India is worried about this problem
 saal 2011-12 main echivi aids infections ke 2
 7% of such cases have been reported in which the cause of this disease could not be determined
 kai maamalon main ise dental surgery se joda ja rahaa he
 Dental Council of India member Dr
 AK Chandna said that certain cases of HIV and HVB have been reported due to dental surgery
 council sabhi doctoron ko samay samay par nirdesh jari karti he
 Treatment of AIDS patients is important, but caution should also be taken
 udhar ats control organijeshan (nako) ke diarector general lav verma ne bhi kaha ki yah ek mahatvapurn lekin ab tak andekhi rahi samasya he
 Soon we will include the possibility of infection from dental surgery in our promotional program
 ilaaj main sui tuutane se aids kaa khatradentiston ke mutabik daanton kaa ilaaj karte samay jo baarik si sui istemaal hoti he, vah kai baar tut jaati he
 The slightest visible injury due to this, often causes the same infection
 isi vajah se dentist echivi aids ke marijon ke ilaaj se ghabaraate hai
 Sometimes doctors even expressly refuse to treat them
 ek survey ke mutabik aise doctoron kii jamaat kul 32 fisadi he
 They are afraid of multi cross infection
 shridevi kii maut ke baad sabase zyada is baat kii charchaa thi ki wo apni beti ko bade parde par dekh nahin sakin
 But in an interview with Vogue Magazine, Karan Johar revealed that Sridevi had seen 25 minutes of footage of Jahnavi Kapoor's film Dhadak
 footage dekhne ke baad unhone jahnavi ko special tips bhi die the
 Jahnavi's first magazine photoshoot before the film's debut, Mordan Lukjahanvi Kapoor, in an interview with Karan Johar, said that the mother had told me for the first time that your mascara has spread a lot in the footage, which is also disturbing you
 
 duusari cheez unhone kahi thi ki tum kabhi chehre par kisi cheez ko nahin saki
 Jahnavi told that i have studied at the Acting School in London
 mujhe vahaan pehali baar chhodte hue maa ne yaheen kaha tha ki camel ko keechad main chhod rahi hum
 The reason for this was that mother did not want me to step into the film world
 wo khushi ke filmon main aane ko relax thim
 He always felt that i was very sensual
 kisi thi maa se aakhri mulaakaat, jahnavi ne kiya khulhasajahnvi ne intervyuu main bataaya ki dubai nikalne se pehle main maa ke saath samay nahin bitaa saki thi
 She met him late in the evening at home after a full day's shoot
 mujhe hameshaa maa hi sulaayaa karti thi, us din bhi raat maine unase sulaane ko kaha tha
 But the mother was very busy preparing for the wedding
 main apane kamare main jaakar so gai, mujhe yaad he der raat wo mere kamare main mujhe sulaane ain thi, neend main bhi main unke haathon ko apane maathe par mahasoos kar rahi thi
 Let us know that Sridevi's elder daughter Jahnavi Kapoor is going to start her film career soon with the Dhadak film being produced in Karan Johar's production house
 film se pehle jahnavi kaa megsine photoshute viral ho gaya he
 Jahnavi is seen in a glamorous style in a photoshoot
 sarkaar badalane se kisi dal ke samarthakon main haar kii hataasha to hoti hi hogi, unke bheetar ek bhay bhi hota he
 Many times the activists of the losing party do not understand the reasons for fear
 iskaa kaaran simpal he
 When a supporter's party comes to power, it also comes in the police stations
 jhuthe mukademon or zamin ke kabzon ke liye bhi aati he
 Recruitment also comes for recommendation and transfer
 thekon ke bantwaare ke liye bhi sarkaar main aati he
 Purchases in government departments also come for horse trading
 in tamaam prakriyaaon main sarkaar ke samarthakon kii mouj ho jaati he
 They begin to get rich overnight
 jaise hi sarkaar jaati he yah tabaka asurakshit mahasoos karne lagata he
 Supporters and party workers of the new government rejoice
 ab puraani sarkaar ke samarthakon or kaaryakartaaon ne sabake liye kaam karne vaale paardarshee system kii maang kii hoti, bhedbhaav kaa virodh kiya hota to sarkaar ke jane par dar kyon lagata he
 The government is always mine, not mine
 jab sarkarein hamaari hone lagengi tab haar se dar nahin lagegaa
 It is important for our government to keep an eye on the government with all the questions and criticisms and keep watching that no one can take advantage of the government
 agar aap kisi party ke kaaryakarta hai to ek sawaal khud se puuchhen kya aap apni sarkaar par sawaal karte hai
 If the worker of the losing party understands this basic thing, then he will be freed from fear and will be preparing for the next election
 bharat main ballat box se lekar electronic mashin par aarope lagate hai
 If the politics of EVM machine is to be understood then the best example of this is Captain Amarinder Singh
 pichley saal sitambar maheene main captain amarinder singh ne ek bayaan diya ki 2012 main chunaav haarane ke baad unhone mukhya chunaav ayukta ko likhaa tha ki iviem ke bare main vistaar se jaanch kii jaae
 How can it be made foolproof because some countries have started using ballot paper again
 congress ne punjab main lagaataar kaha he ki iviem phulpruf nahin he
 In September 2016, Captain Amarinder Singh again questioned evms and said government officials could tamper with evms
 isliye duusare rajyon se iviem mashine laayi jaaen
 What Captain Amarinder Singh said after winning elections in 2017 is funny
 unhone kaha ki aam aadmi party haar se baukhala kar iviem main gadabadi kaa aarope laga rahi he
 Amarinder's three statements suggest that after he lost, he was questioning evms for fear of defeat, but after winning he became confident of evms
 udhaaharan captain sahab kaa diya he magar sawaal kai bade netaaon ne uthaaye hai
 On youtube you will find videos of BJP MP Subramanian Swamy tampering with EVM machines, in which he explains in detail how the main part of EVM comes from Japan, but the same Japan does not use EVM
 iviem mashiinon main chhedchhad kii sambhaavna ko lekar subrahmanyam swami mukhya cheharaa hai or ve adaalat tak is ladaai ko lekar gaye hai
 Jayalalithaa is no longer in the world but she moved to the Madras High Court in 2001
 aarope tha ki iviem main voter batan dabaata he lekin jab tak peethasin adhikari batan nahin dabaata, uskaa vot register nahin hota he
 The voter's vote will not be counted if the button is not pressed by the Presiding Officer for any reason
 jayalalita ne kaha tha ki raksha mantri jorge furnandis or em karunanidhi ne bhi iviem par sawaal uthaae the magar jeetne ke baad chup ho gaye
 In 2010, Telugu Desam Party leader Chandrababu Naidu said that evms can be tempered
 times of india kii agast 2010 kii ek khabar ke anusaar rajyasabha main bijepi or left ke netaaon ne iviem kaa masalaa uthaaya tha
 Arun Jaitley had demanded that the government should call an all-party meeting on this, also call some technical experts so that those doubts are cleared
 laal krishna adwani ne kaha tha ki puure vishwa ke anubhav ke anusaar aisi koi chiz nahin he jise temper pruf iviem kaha ja sake
 Meaning there is no machine that can be claimed that cannot be tampered with
 bijepi pravaktaa ji ve el narsimha raav ne iviem mashiinon main chhedchhad kii sambhaavna ko lekar ek kitaab bhi likhi he jiskaa zikr tazaa vivaad ke baad koob ho rahaa he
 gvl's royalties could increase if sales of this book went up, although he believes that as an election expert he wrote, not as a member of the party
 unke kuch sawaalon ko aage chal kar chunaav ayog ne sudhaar bhi kiya he
 They no longer have the same opinion
 dilli main 8 farvari 2015 ko matdaan hone the, 3 farvari ko arvind kejariwal ne twit kiya tha ki dilli kaint main chaar iviem mashiinon main gadabadi pai gai he, unamem kisi bhi batan ko dabaane par bijepi ko vot chalaa jaataa tha
 The March 2012 Indian Express report begins with the line that eighty appeals have been filed in various courts for tampering of EVM machines
 in 80 mukademon kaa kya states he, hamen nahin maaloom
 In the same report of the Express, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya's statement was printed that the Election Commission of the States should reform the EVM to make it foolproof
 bombai hai court main congress ke teen netaaon ne apil daayar kii ki apni haar to sweekaar karte hai magar chaahate hai ki iviem ko phulpruf banaaya jaae
 Before the election he was approached by the software engineer that we could tamper with the evms
 2010 main gujarat main congress ne tab ke mukhyamantri narendra modi par iviem mashiinon se chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 The Congress was then defeated in the civic elections
 2012 main amritsar ke disi ne rajya chunaav adhikari ke paas yah masalaa uthaaya he ki kuch ward main dobaaraa se matdaan hon, jahaan par kuch yuva logon ne wifai or bluetooth kaa istemaal kiya taaki iviem ko temper kiya ja sake
 It was mentioned by Captain Amarinder Singh in 2012
 isi saal maharashtra ke ek nirdaleey ummidavaar ne rajya chunaav ayog se poocha ki isaki jaanch ho ki kam se kam unka or unke parivaar kaa vot kahaan gaya, unhen zero vot kaise mili hai
 It is clear from these examples that the accusers of EVM machines have also been from the Congress and also from the BJP
 kshetreey dalon ke netaaon ne bhi lagaae hai
 So neither is Mayawati nor Arvind Kejriwal doing the work of doubting evms for the first time
 mayawati ne kaha ki wo modi se nahin mashin se haari hai
 Mayawati has said that she is going to court too
 har maheene kii 11 taarikh ko unki party kaala diwas manaayegi
 According to Mayawati, this is the date on which democracy has been killed
 arvind kejariwal ne dilli main press conference kar kaha ki kai boothon main unki party ko ek yaa do vot milen hai jabaki unke volatinr kii sankhya isse adhik he
 Kejriwal said that in 2013, the Supreme Court had asked the Election Commission that in all assembly elections, there should be a system with EVM machines that a slip on the button will come out with the symbol of the party
 use ek bakse main jamaa kiya jaae
 So that it can be counted later when there is a dispute
 kejariwal ne kaha ki is baar punjab main 32 jagahon par yah system lagu kiya gaya tha
 It has happened in some places in UP as well
 kejariwal kii maang he ki aise boothon kii ginati honi chahie taaki pataa chale ki iviem mashin or slip ke ginati match karti he yaa nahin
 Keep one thing in mind
 iviem mashine karaab nikal jaati hai
 Being spoiled and manipulated is both different
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main surat main 161 iviem mashine karaab pai gayi thi
 It appeared in the Times of India on 20 April
 iviem mashin ko lekar bharat main hi sawaal nahin uthe hai
 There have been agitations against EVM machines in many countries of the world
 jabardast virodh hua he
 In the shadow of the same movement, there have been questions before the UP elections in India
 tippaniyan Only 5 out of 50 states in the US use evms, in every other state ballot voting
 europe ke kai deshon main matdaan ballat se hi hota he
 The Netherlands is considered a vanguard of EVM machines, but has stopped using it
 germany main adaalat ne electronic voting mashin ke istemaal ko paardarshee nahin mana tha
 It is not necessary that if the election is being held from the ballot, then it is from the ballot here itself
 america kii mashin kii tulana bharat ke mashin se karnaa kahaan tak thik hoga
 Will the technology of both be the same
 ham nahin jaanate hai
 The Election Commission has termed all the apprehensions wrong and said that these machines cannot be rigged
 pehle bhi sawaal uthe hai magar is baar sawaalon ke saath saath jis tarah se afvaahen fail rahi hai use lekar kuch kiya janaa chahie
 Because now the rumor about EVM has gone beyond UP
 maharashtra ke nikaay chunaavon main hi is aanshkaon ko hawa mili thi jise punjab or upi ke nateezon ne tej kar diya he
 Therefore, the commission should do something beyond the two four line statements so that there is no room for such questions among the wider public
 agar haarane vaali party kaa kaaryakarta ye mul baat samaj legaa to wo dar se azaad hokar agle chunaav kii taiyaari main lag jayega
 In India, charges range from ballot boxes to electronic machines
 agar iviem mashin kii raajnneeti ko samajhnaa he to iske best udhaaharan hai captain amarinder singh
 In September last year, Captain Amarinder Singh made a statement that after losing the election in 2012, he wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner that the evms should be investigated in detail
 ise kaise phulpruf banaaya ja saktaa he kyonki kuch deshon ne dobaaraa ballat paper kaa istemaal karnaa shuru kar diya he
 The Congress has consistently said in Punjab that evms are not foolproof
 2016 ke sitambar maheene main captain amarinder singh ne phir se iviem par sawaal uthaaya or kaha ki sarkari adhikari iviem se chhedchhad kar sakate hai
 Therefore EVM machines should be brought from other states
 2017 main chunaav jeetne ke baad captain amarinder singh ne jo kaha wo mazedaar he
 He said that the Aam Aadmi Party was blaming the EVM for disturbing it by losing
 amarinder ke teenon bayanon se lagata he ki ve haarane ke baad, haar ke dar se to iviem par sawaal uthaa rahe the magar jeetne ke baad unhen iviem par bharosa ho gaya
 The example is given by Captain Saheb, but many big leaders have raised the question
 you tub par aapako bijepi saansad subramanyam swami ke iviem mashiinon main chhedchhad ke video mil jaaenge jinamein ve vistaar se bataa rahe hai ki kis tarah iviem kaa mukhya ang japan se ban kar aata he, magar vahi japan iviem kaa istemaal nahin karata
 Subrahmanyam Swamy is the main face for the possibility of tampering with EVM machines and has taken the fight to court
 jayalalita ab duniya main nahin hai lekin 2001 main ve madras hoicourt chali gayi
 It was alleged that in the EVM, the voter presses the button but until the presiding officer presses the button, his vote is not registered
 agar kisi bhi vajah se peethasin adhikari se batan nahin dabaa to voter kaa vot gina nahin jayega
 Jayalalithaa had said that Defense Ministers George Fernandes and m Karunanidhi had also questioned evms but kept quiet after winning
 2010 main telegu desham party ke netaa chandrababu naidu ne kaha tha ki iviem ko temper kiya ja saktaa he
 According to a Times of India news in August 2010, BJP and Left leaders raised the issue of evms in the Rajya Sabha
 arun jetali ne maang kii thi ki sarkaar is par sarvadaleey baithak bulaaye, kuch takneekee visheshgyon ko bhi bulaaye taaki jo andeh hai unhen dur kiya ja sake
 Lal Krishna Advani had said that according to the experience of the whole world, there is no such thing that can be called Temper Proof EVM
 matlab aisi koi mashin nahin he jiske bare main daawa kiya ja saktaa he ki chhedchhad nahin ho sakati he
 BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao has also written a book about the possibility of tampering of EVM machines, which is being mentioned after the recent controversy
 agar is kitaab kii bikri bad gai to jiviel kii roylty bad sakati he vaise unka maananaa he ki ek chunavi visheshgy ke taur par unhone likhaa tha, party ke sadsy ke naate nahin
 The Election Commission has also rectified some of his questions
 ab unki waisi raay nahin he
 Voting was to be held in Delhi on 8 February 2015, on 3 February, Arvind Kejriwal tweeted that four EVM machines were found to be malfunctioning in Delhi Cantt, pressing any button in them used to vote for BJP
 march 2012 ke indian express kii report kii shuruyaat is line se hoti he ki iviem mashiinon main chhedchhad ko lekar vibhinn adaalaton main assi apil file kii gai hai
 What is the status of these 80 cases, we do not know
 express ke usee report main bijepi netaa kirit somaiya kaa bayaan chapa tha ki rajyon ke chunaav ayog ko iviem main sudhaar karnaa chahie taaki ise phulpruf banaaya ja sake
 In Bombay High Court, three Congress leaders filed an appeal that they accept their defeat but want evms to be foolproof
 chunaav se pehle unhen software ejeeniyar ne sampark kiya tha ki ham iviem main chhedchhad kar sakate hai
 In 2010, the Congress in Gujarat accused then Chief Minister Narendra Modi of tampering evms
 tab congress nikaay chunaavon main haar gai thi
 In 2012, the DC of Amritsar raised the issue with the state election officer about re-polling in some wards where some young people used wifi and Bluetooth to temper evms
 iskaa zikr captain amarinder singh ne 2012 main kiya tha
 In the same year, an independent candidate from Maharashtra asked the State Election Commission to check that at least where his and his family's votes went, how they got zero votes
 in udaahranon se saaf he ki iviem mashiinon ko lekar aarope lagane vaale congress ke bhi rahe hai, bijepi ke bhi rahe hai
 Leaders of regional parties have also imposed
 to iviem ko lekar shaq karne kaa kaam pehali baar na mayawati kar rahi hai na arvind kejariwal
 Mayawati said that she lost to Modi, not machine
 mayawati ne kaha he ki wo adaalat bhi jane vaali hai
 His party will celebrate Black Day on the 11th of every month
 mayawati ke mutabik ye wo taarikh he jis din loktantr kii hatya hui he
 Arvind Kejriwal held a press conference in Delhi and said that his party got one or two votes in many booths, while his number of voltaire is more than this
 kejariwal ne kaha ki 2013 main supreme court ne chunaav ayog se kaha tha ki sabhi vidhansabha chunaavon main iviem mashiinon ke saath aisi vyavastha ho ki batan dabaane par ek slip nikle jis par party kaa chunaav chinh ho
 It should be stored in a box
 taaki baad main vivaad hone par ginati kii ja sake
 Kejriwal said that this time this system was implemented in 32 places in Punjab
 upi main bhi kuch jagahon par hua he
 Kejriwal demands that such booths should be counted so that the evms and slip counts match whether the evms match
 ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhiye
 EVM machines deteriorate
 karaab hona or unase chhedchhad kiya janaa donon alag alag hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, 161 evms were found defective in Surat
 ye 20 april ke times of india main chapa he
 Questions have not arisen in India about EVM machine
 duniya ke kai deshon main iviem mashiinon ke khilaaf andolan chale hai
 There has been strong opposition
 unheen andolan kii chaaya main bharat main upi chunaav ke pehle sawaal karte rahe hai
 The comments america main 50 main se sirf 5 rajya main hi iviem kaa istamaal hota he, baaki har rajya main ballat se matdaan hota he
 In many countries of Europe, the ballot is held by ballot
 netherland ko iviem mashiinon kaa agua mana jaataa he, magar usne iskaa istemaal band kar diya he
 The court in Germany did not consider the use of electronic voting machines to be transparent
 zaruri nahin ki chunaav kahin ballat se ho rahaa he to yahaan ballat se hi ho
 How far would it be better to compare America's machine to India's machine
 kya donon kii technology ek hi hogi
 We do not know
 chunaav ayog ne tamaam ashankaon ko galat bataaya he or kaha he ki in mashiinon main dhaandhlee nahin ho sakati he
 Questions have also been raised earlier, but this time along with the questions, the way rumors are spreading, something must be done
 kyonki ab iviem ko lekar afvaah upi se aage ja chuki he
 In the civic elections of Maharashtra, this audacity got wind, which has been accelerated by the results of Punjab and UP
 isliye ayog ko do chaar pankti ke bayaan se aage jaakar kuch karnaa chahie taaki vyapak janata ke bich aise sawaalon ke liye jagah nahin bache
 The example is given by Captain Saheb, but many big leaders have raised the question

 isliye ayog ko do chaar pankti ke bayaan se aage jaakar kuch karnaa chahie taaki vyapak janata ke bich aise sawaalon ke liye jagah nahin bache
 Jayalalithaa is no longer in the world but she moved to the Madras High Court in 2001
 aarope tha ki iviem main voter batan dabaata he lekin jab tak peethasin adhikari batan nahin dabaata, uskaa vot register nahin hota he
 The voter's vote will not be counted if the button is not pressed by the Presiding Officer for any reason
 jayalalita ne kaha tha ki raksha mantri jorge furnandis or em karunanidhi ne bhi iviem par sawaal uthaae the magar jeetne ke baad chup ho gaye
 In 2010, Telugu Desam Party leader Chandrababu Naidu said that evms can be tempered
 times of india kii agast 2010 kii ek khabar ke anusaar rajyasabha main bijepi or left ke netaaon ne iviem kaa masalaa uthaaya tha
 Arun Jaitley had demanded that the government should call an all-party meeting on this, also call some technical experts so that those doubts are cleared
 laal krishna adwani ne kaha tha ki puure vishwa ke anubhav ke anusaar aisi koi chiz nahin he jise temper pruf iviem kaha ja sake
 Meaning there is no machine that can be claimed that cannot be tampered with
 bijepi pravaktaa ji ve el narsimha raav ne iviem mashiinon main chhedchhad kii sambhaavna ko lekar ek kitaab bhi likhi he jiskaa zikr tazaa vivaad ke baad koob ho rahaa he
 gvl's royalties could increase if sales of this book went up, although he believes that as an election expert he wrote, not as a member of the party
 unke kuch sawaalon ko aage chal kar chunaav ayog ne sudhaar bhi kiya he
 They no longer have the same opinion
 dilli main 8 farvari 2015 ko matdaan hone the, 3 farvari ko arvind kejariwal ne twit kiya tha ki dilli kaint main chaar iviem mashiinon main gadabadi pai gai he, unamem kisi bhi batan ko dabaane par bijepi ko vot chalaa jaataa tha
 The March 2012 Indian Express report begins with the line that eighty appeals have been filed in various courts for tampering of EVM machines
 in 80 mukademon kaa kya states he, hamen nahin maaloom
 In the same report of the Express, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya's statement was printed that the Election Commission of the States should reform the EVM to make it foolproof
 bombai hai court main congress ke teen netaaon ne apil daayar kii ki apni haar to sweekaar karte hai magar chaahate hai ki iviem ko phulpruf banaaya jaae
 Before the election he was approached by the software engineer that we could tamper with the evms
 2010 main gujarat main congress ne tab ke mukhyamantri narendra modi par iviem mashiinon se chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 The Congress was then defeated in the civic elections
 2012 main amritsar ke disi ne rajya chunaav adhikari ke paas yah masalaa uthaaya he ki kuch ward main dobaaraa se matdaan hon, jahaan par kuch yuva logon ne wifai or bluetooth kaa istemaal kiya taaki iviem ko temper kiya ja sake
 It was mentioned by Captain Amarinder Singh in 2012
 isi saal maharashtra ke ek nirdaleey ummidavaar ne rajya chunaav ayog se poocha ki isaki jaanch ho ki kam se kam unka or unke parivaar kaa vot kahaan gaya, unhen zero vot kaise mili hai
 It is clear from these examples that the accusers of EVM machines have also been from the Congress and also from the BJP
 kshetreey dalon ke netaaon ne bhi lagaae hai
 So neither is Mayawati nor Arvind Kejriwal doing the work of doubting evms for the first time
 mayawati ne kaha ki wo modi se nahin mashin se haari hai
 Mayawati has said that she is going to court too
 har maheene kii 11 taarikh ko unki party kaala diwas manaayegi
 According to Mayawati, this is the date on which democracy has been killed
 arvind kejariwal ne dilli main press conference kar kaha ki kai boothon main unki party ko ek yaa do vot milen hai jabaki unke volatinr kii sankhya isse adhik he
 Kejriwal said that in 2013, the Supreme Court had asked the Election Commission that in all assembly elections, there should be a system with EVM machines that a slip on the button will come out with the symbol of the party
 use ek bakse main jamaa kiya jaae
 So that it can be counted later when there is a dispute
 kejariwal ne kaha ki is baar punjab main 32 jagahon par yah system lagu kiya gaya tha
 It has happened in some places in UP as well
 kejariwal kii maang he ki aise boothon kii ginati honi chahie taaki pataa chale ki iviem mashin or slip ke ginati match karti he yaa nahin
 Keep one thing in mind
 iviem mashine karaab nikal jaati hai
 Being spoiled and manipulated is both different
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main surat main 161 iviem mashine karaab pai gayi thi
 It appeared in the Times of India on 20 April
 iviem mashin ko lekar bharat main hi sawaal nahin uthe hai
 There have been agitations against EVM machines in many countries of the world
 jabardast virodh hua he
 In the shadow of the same movement, there have been questions before the UP elections in India
 tippaniyan Only 5 out of 50 states in the US use evms, in every other state ballot voting
 europe ke kai deshon main matdaan ballat se hi hota he
 The Netherlands is considered a vanguard of EVM machines, but has stopped using it
 germany main adaalat ne electronic voting mashin ke istemaal ko paardarshee nahin mana tha
 It is not necessary that if the election is being held from the ballot, then it is from the ballot here itself
 america kii mashin kii tulana bharat ke mashin se karnaa kahaan tak thik hoga
 Will the technology of both be the same
 ham nahin jaanate hai
 The Election Commission has termed all the apprehensions wrong and said that these machines cannot be rigged
 pehle bhi sawaal uthe hai magar is baar sawaalon ke saath saath jis tarah se afvaahen fail rahi hai use lekar kuch kiya janaa chahie
 Because now the rumor about EVM has gone beyond UP
 maharashtra ke nikaay chunaavon main hi is aanshkaon ko hawa mili thi jise punjab or upi ke nateezon ne tej kar diya he
 Therefore, the commission should do something beyond the two four line statements so that there is no room for such questions among the wider public
 march 2012 ke indian express kii report kii shuruyaat is line se hoti he ki iviem mashiinon main chhedchhad ko lekar vibhinn adaalaton main assi apil file kii gai hai
 What is the status of these 80 cases, we do not know

 The Election Commission has termed all the apprehensions wrong and said that these machines cannot be rigged
 pehle bhi sawaal uthe hai magar is baar sawaalon ke saath saath jis tarah se afvaahen fail rahi hai use lekar kuch kiya janaa chahie
 Because now the rumor about EVM has gone beyond UP
 maharashtra ke nikaay chunaavon main hi is aanshkaon ko hawa mili thi jise punjab or upi ke nateezon ne tej kar diya he
 Therefore, the commission should do something beyond the two four line statements so that there is no room for such questions among the wider public
 ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhiye
 EVM machines deteriorate
 karaab hona or unase chhedchhad kiya janaa donon alag alag hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, 161 evms were found defective in Surat
 ye 20 april ke times of india main chapa he
 Questions have not arisen in India about EVM machine
 duniya ke kai deshon main iviem mashiinon ke khilaaf andolan chale hai
 There has been strong opposition
 unheen andolan kii chaaya main bharat main upi chunaav ke pehle sawaal karte rahe hai
 The comments america main 50 main se sirf 5 rajya main hi iviem kaa istamaal hota he, baaki har rajya main ballat se matdaan hota he
 In many countries of Europe, the ballot is held by ballot
 netherland ko iviem mashiinon kaa agua mana jaataa he, magar usne iskaa istemaal band kar diya he
 The court in Germany did not consider the use of electronic voting machines to be transparent
 zaruri nahin ki chunaav kahin ballat se ho rahaa he to yahaan ballat se hi ho
 How far would it be better to compare America's machine to India's machine
 kya donon kii technology ek hi hogi
 We do not know
 chunaav ayog ne tamaam ashankaon ko galat bataaya he or kaha he ki in mashiinon main dhaandhlee nahin ho sakati he
 Questions have also been raised earlier, but this time along with the questions, the way rumors are spreading, something must be done
 kyonki ab iviem ko lekar afvaah upi se aage ja chuki he
 In the civic elections of Maharashtra, this audacity got wind, which has been accelerated by the results of Punjab and UP
 isliye ayog ko do chaar pankti ke bayaan se aage jaakar kuch karnaa chahie taaki vyapak janata ke bich aise sawaalon ke liye jagah nahin bache
 Only 5 out of 50 states in the US use evms, in every other state ballot voting
 europe ke kai deshon main matdaan ballat se hi hota he
 The Netherlands is considered a vanguard of EVM machines, but has stopped using it
 germany main adaalat ne electronic voting mashin ke istemaal ko paardarshee nahin mana tha
 It is not necessary that if the election is being held from the ballot, then it is from the ballot here itself
 america kii mashin kii tulana bharat ke mashin se karnaa kahaan tak thik hoga
 Will the technology of both be the same
 ham nahin jaanate hai
 The Election Commission has termed all the apprehensions wrong and said that these machines cannot be rigged

 Our fight is with Kashmir, not with Kashmiris, the Prime Minister said this to the country, but two young workers of his party did not listen
 kya kashmiri hona apane aap main aparaadh ho chukaa he ki jahaan ve dikhaai de vahaan do chaar log lathi danda lekar peetane lagen
 Have we come to this position, will you ever think what you know about Kashmir or Kashmiris before hating
 news channelon or whatsap uniwarsity ke failaae propeganda se aap kashmir or kashmiriyon ke bare main raay rakhte hai to aapako ek baar khud ko check karnaa chahie
 Otherwise half the incomplete information can take you on the path of crime

 zaahir he ghatana itani hi der kii nahin hogi
 This incident is on Wednesday evening
 is video ke alaava bhi aage peeche or bhi bahut kuch hua hoga
 You can not understand his frustration and helplessness by picking someone off the road and being beaten in this way and discovering his identity that it is Kashmiri
 kyonki news channelon or whatsap uniwarsity kii propeganda mashinari ne aapaki chetana ko nasht kar diya he
 This scene is not about killing a Kashmiri
 iskaa bhi he ki ab kuch log lathi danda lekar aaenge or aapako bharat ke samvidhan kii di hui pahchaan or adhikaar se bedakhal kar denge
 The incident that has happened to these Kashmiri youth will happen to you as well, but in this prime time i will tell that it is happening to those who are not Kashmiris too
 inke kurte ke rang se mujhe koi shikaayat nahin, balki is rang ke mere paas teen kurte hai
 But it is a question that before beating, these people wore this color kurto as uniform, that if they do such action by putting color, no one will say anything
 agar aisa he to inhen samajhaana chahie ki yah rang ab raajnneetik bhi ho chukaa he
 So do not act like this whenever wearing ideology
 bees saal se mohammad afazal nayak or abdul salaam lakhanu aakar footpath par kaashew, kismis akhrot or baadaam bech rahe hai
 People of Kashmir bring shawls to all our neighborhoods
 afazal or abdul salaam ko footpath se uthaakar maaraa gaya, aatankwaadi kaha gaya or kashmiri kaha gaya
 Proof of being Indian was sought
 aapako bhi check karnaa chahie ki kya aapako kashmiri dikhne par gussa aata he, lagata he aap inhen dinon main kashmir nahin gaye hai
 Ask the tourists who have gone there
 kya unhone kabhi aisi shikaayat kii he ki vahaan ke log dekhte hi nafrat karne lage hon
 Ask Satyapal Malik, the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir

 Facebook profile reveals a lot about Banjrang Sonkar
 bhartiya janata yuva morcha kaa netaa bajrang sonkar vishwa hindu dal kaa mahanagar pramukh he
 There is no need to fear seeing pictures of him with a gun in different poses, because the same Bajrang Sonkar stretches his arms when he takes pictures on the shore
 samandar ko dekhakar uske bheetar ai yah udaartaa kis vajah se itani sankuchit ho jaati he vah nishaanaa saadhane kii sochane lagata he yah to bajrang ke saath baatcheet karne par hi pataa chalegaa
 His post is that we are fighting for Hindus and the army
 bajrang sonkar ne ghatana ke baad apane fasebuk pej par post saajha kiya he
 Which shows that although he is in a different party, he is also related to the leaders of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha
 abhijaat mishra bhartiya janata yuva morcha kaa mahasichav he
 Himanshu Awasthi, who was arrested in the Daliganj incident, also shared a post that he had gone to a channel's debate show

 That is, Himanshu Awasthi is not even an anonymous person
 lakhanu police kaa kahana he ki bajrang sonkar kai baar aparaadh kar chukaa he
 There is also an accused in a murder case
 phir bhi vah fasebuk or lakhanu main sena or hindu ke liye kaam karnaa chahta he
 Who does not need good people
 banjrang sonkar ne ek sawaal kiya he ki ham hindu or sena ke liye lard rahe hai, kitne log saath denge to 548 coment aae hai
 Many people have criticized Bajrang and many people have spoken of supporting him
 ek anya aaropee he himanshu avasthi
 Himanshu Awasthi calls himself the state president of the Vishwa Hindu Dal
 bijepi ke saath apane sambandhon kaa khulkar pradarshan karte hai
 In Facebook, Himanshu Awasthi has described himself as a former BJP leader

 Then shares the video at 4
44 pm

 This picture of Himanshu Awasthi shows how hard he is working to add a brick, for whom he is working
 vah modi eent ko sabase bharosemand eent maanata he or likhaa he ki ghar bhi banegaa to modi eent se banegaa
 The National President of the Vishwa Hindu Dal has said that he is a supporter of the BJP and works under the patronage of the BJP, works for the BJP
 bijepi ke pravaktaa hero vaajapeyi ne kaha he ki bahut se log unki vichaardhaara kaa paalan karte hai, kanoon todane par karrwai hogi

 media main baat uthne se pehle himanshu avasthi ne post kiya tha ki tum apni jaan barkaraar rakho, main apane jalwe barkaraar rakhuunga
 It seems that there is still a possibility of a good poet in Himanshu
 varna jaan or jalwe ke saath barkaar rakhane kaa itnaa acha meter nahin bitha paata
 i see some hope after seeing the impression of Lucknowi mood on Himanshu
 afazal nayak or abdul salaam ke saath jo hua wo thik nahin tha
 It was when the Prime Minister had said in Tonk on 23 February that our fight was with Kashmir and not with Kashmiris
 himanshu or bajrang jaise sonkaron ko to apane netaa kii baat thik se sunani chahie
 The leader should also convey his point properly to the youth like these
 pichley dinon kahaan kya hua, ghatana choti thi kii badi thi, kashmiri bacchon ke saath hindustan ke kisi kone main kya hua kya nahin, mudda ye nahin he
 This should not happen in this country
 hedline banane ke chakkar main ham dhyaan nahin dete ki pradhanmantri ne kya kaha
 What will be the point of their condemnation or advice when they themselves say that what happened and what did not happen is not the issue
 yahi to mudda he
 What else is the issue again
 afzal nayak or abdul salaam ko akelaa mahasoos nahin karnaa chahie
 Because there was also a single one in the crowd of the same slain who came and told the slayer why you are killing
 kanoon kaa sahaara lijie
 Do not take the law in hand
 akelaa bolnaa vaaki jokhim bharaa kaam ho gaya he
 Therefore, we praise this Sharif Urban

 itane saare log milakar ek noujvaan ko isliye maar rahe hai kyonki usne ek tivi sho main modi sarkaar kii nitiyon par sawaal kar diya
 The name of the channel is not mentioned in the media report, the UP channel was debiting for Bharat Samachar at 11 am
 bharat samachar lakhanu kaa channel he
 According to the Indian Express, the name of the program was to maintain the atmosphere
 quint website ne likhaa he ki adnan saudi se mujffarnagar board kaa imtahaan dene aayaa tha
 Coming from somewhere, i stopped watching TV debates
 shaamil ho gaya
 As soon as the government's employment, from law and order to the agricultural crisis were questioned, then the people present there started dragging and killing it
 adnan ke mutabik use aatankwaadi tak kaha gaya
 In the media report, those killed have been described as BJP workers
 jise ham apni taraf se satyapit nahin kar rahe hai
 Amit Bhatnagar of the Indian Express has spoken to India News anchor Narendra Pratap
 narendra pratap ne kaha he ki ve paas ke ilaake main yuvaaon ke bich kaarykram karne gaye the
 Many types of questions were being discussed
 jab bhi koi asahaj baaten karata tha, bijepi ke kaaryakarta pradhanmantri modi ke paksh main jayakaare lagane lagate the or bharat mata kii jai bolne lagate the
 And started killing Adnan
 bheed kab ban rahi he, kyon ban rahi he kiski ban rahi he ise samajhane ke liye chemistry main 100 number laana zaruri nahin he
 Thanks to Arshad Zaman and Arshad Pasha who were passing by and pulled Adnan from the crowd

 The argument made in the Supreme Court regarding the investigative report of N
 Ram of Hindu newspaper on the Rafale case is also part of the process which is making questioning questionable in some way
 adaalat main atorni general ne kaha ki sikret file chori ho gai he
 The report is printed on the basis of the same
 akhbaar ke khilaaf aafitious sikret act ke tahat karrwai honi chahie
 The Indian Express has written that the Attorney General named both The Hindu and ANI
 aapako yaad dilaa den ki 8 farvari ko jab raksha mantri kaa nots en ram ne chapa tha tab raksha mantri kaa bayaan aayaa tha
 In that statement, he did not say that the secret file was stolen
 balki wo to yah bataa rahi thim ki report chhapane vaale patrkaar ne puraa note nahin chapa
 It is evident that at that time the file or notes will be in the knowledge of Nirmala Sitharaman
 or yah kisi chori thi ki jo dacument en ram ne chaape, usee kaa puraa hissaa eenai ne twit kiya tha
 a shared statement has come from the Press Club of India and the Indian Women's Press Corps
 is bayaan main supreme court main atorni general kii baat par gahari chintaa jataai gai he
 He said that the reports on Rafal published in The Hindu newspaper were based on a stolen document of the Ministry of Defense
 khuli adaalat main yah kaha gaya he ki is report ko chhapane se rashtriya suraksha ko khatra pahunchaa he or yah aapraadhik maamla he
 This statement of the biggest law officer in the government will not only have an impact on the media but also journalists who depend on sources for information
 sarkaar kaa yah kahana ki oficial sacrate act kaa ulanghan hua he, bharat jaise loktantr main free press kii mul avadharana par chot karata he
 It is the duty of the fourth pillar to report and question in public interest
 chaahe kisi kii bhi sarkaar ho
 It is very unfortunate that big officials of the government are tarnishing their duties
 editors gild ne bhi bayaan jari kar en ram kaa samarthan kiya he or atorni general ke bayaan kii aalochana kii he
 The Guild has said that the Attorney General later said that no action will be taken against the lawyer or journalist, but his statement that the report is based on a stolen file is a matter of concern
 isse media main dar baithegaa or report karne kii swatantraaa par asar padegaa
 Any attempt to use the Official Secret Act is scandalous
 patrkaar ko baadhya nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki vah apana sorce bataae
 The Guild condemns such threats
 sarkaar se apil karata he ki vah aisi koi karrwai karne se bache jisase media kii swatantraaa prabhavit ho

 This does not reduce the morale of the army, rather it boosts the morale of every soldier that in India there are still some journalists who do journalism and do not lick the floor

 Government announced to give 25 thousand crores fund for real estate, out of which 15 thousand crores will be given by LIC and SBI, in this way LIC has once again become a trouble-maker for the government
 lic's history of saving the honor of the government is very old
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman Has announced major relief for the real estate sector
 unhone kaha ki deshbhar main atake houseing project ke liye sarkaar 25 hajaar karod rupee kaa fund degi
 According to the plan, out of this 10 thousand crore rupees will be given by the government and the remaining 15 thousand crores will be given by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) and State Bank of India (SBI) together
 is tarah elisi ek baar phir sarkaar ke liye sankatmochan banakar saamne aayaa he
 Although the opposition may criticize in this matter, such history of LIC is very old and it has always stood as a troubleshooter for the government, whether it was the NDA government or the UPA
 IDBI ko bachayagauratlab he ki iske pehle khastahal bank IDBI ke liye bhi bhartiya jivan beemaa nigam (elisi) sankatmochan banakar aayaa tha
 LIC bought a 51 per cent stake in the bank to protect it
 elisi ne is adhigrahan ke tahat 28 disambar ko idibiai bank main 14,500 karod rupee daale the
 Then on January 21, he added another Rs 5,030 crore to the bank
 tab bazaar ke vishleshkon or jaankaron ne is faisle par hairaani or nakhushi jataai thi
 LIC does not have the skills and experience to run a bank
 haalanki, iske alaava bhi elisi ne kai sarkari bainkon main nivesh kar rakhaa he
 LIC has close to 1 in government securities
 87 lakh karod rupee kaa nivesh kar rakhaa he
 There is also a discussion about the issue of saving Air India, that if no buyer of Air India is found, then the government will give a big stake in it to LIC
 haalanki, abhi iske bare main koi pukhta khabar nahin he
 However, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has invested in many such companies which are on the verge of 'bankruptcy'
 aisi kai companiyon kii yachika rashtriya company kanoon tribunel (ensielti) dwaara diwaliyapan kii prakriya (ibisi) ke tahat sweekaar kar lagi gai he
 LIC will give 1 for highway
 25 lakh karod kaa karjakendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne haal main bataaya tha ki rajmargon ke vikaas ke liye saal 2024 tak bhartiya jivan beemaa nigam (LIC) ne sarkaar ko 1
 It is proposed to give a loan of Rs 25 lakh crore
 nitin gadakari ne ek intervyuu main bataaya tha, 'LIC ne ek saal main 25,000 karod or paanch saal main 1
 25 lakh crore has been proposed
 ham is fund ko rajmargon ke nirmaan main lagaayenge
 'the Congress has been opposing the lic's big money to save government companies in the attacking government, but the truth is that the same has happened during the tenure of the Congress or the UPA government
 sitambar maheene main congress netaa priyanka gandhi ne ek twit kar kaha tha ki narendra modi sarkaar bhartiya jivan beemaa nigam (elisi) kaa paisa ghate vaali companiyon main lagaakar desh ke aam logon ke bharose ko chakanachur kar rahi he
 Priyanka Gandhi had tweeted, 'LIC is another name for trust in India
 aam log apni mehnat kii kamai bhavishya kii suraksha ke liye elisi main lagaate hai, lekin bhaajapa sarkaar unke bharose ko chakanachur karte hue elisi kaa paisa ghate vaali companiyon main laga rahi he
 What is this policy that has become only a loss policy? ”congress leader Ajay Maken had then cited an RBI report claiming that LIC had doubled its investment in 'risky' state-owned companies to 22 in the last five years
 64 lakh karod rupee kar liya he
 History of saving government or government companies is old, however LIC history of saving government companies is very old
 yah upie ke daur main bhi kai baar dekha ja chukaa he
 During the tenure of Manmohan Singh in 2009, LIC had bought stakes in several banks
 iske baad 2010 main saarvajanik companiyon aaraisi, enemdisi or antipisi ke vinievesh main elisi ne 11,500 karod rupee lagaakar sarkaar kii izzat bachaai
 Respecting the UPA government several times, when ongc's disinvestment was seen to have flopped in 2012, LIC came to the fore at the last moment and bought 84 per cent of the offered shares by investing Rs 12,749 crore
 tab bijepi netaa yashavanth sinha kii adhyakshata vaali vitt maamalon kii sthaayee samiti ne isaki aalochana karte hue kaha tha ki isse 29 karod policydharakon ke hiton ko chot pahonchegi
 This tradition continued even during the tenure of the Modi government, when in 2014 it brought relief to the government by buying a large stake in BHEL

 Ram Vilas Paswan fiercely attacked the Congress on this occasion
 unhone kaha ki congress ne kabhi bhi daliton or bhimrao ambedkar ke liye kuch nahin kiya
 The Congress used abuses for him
 paswan ne congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki congress to baba sahib kii tasviir sansad ke central haul main bhi nahin lagaana chaahati thi
 He said that he did so when VP Singh's government came
 paswan ne kaha ki koi maai kaa laal paidaa nahin hua he jo aarakshan khatm kar de, na bhuto naa bhavishyati

 Dravid said, "during the privacy of the dressing room, i sometimes let my emotions flow
 main bahut jald naaraaz nahin hota lekin kabhi aisa samay aata he jab main khud se hataash ho jaataa hum, shaayad kharaab shot khilne ke baad, out hone ke baad, maine apane kuch saamaan ko nuksaan bhi pahunchaaya he
 "he said," i think you will allow me to do this at least once or twice during 20 years
 ’’ kai match vijayi pari khilne vaale khilaadi ke liye kisi ek acchhee pari ko chunanaa mushkil he lekin dravid ne australia ke khilaaf edilade main apane dohare shatak ko apni sarvshereshth pariyon main se ek bataaya

" ’’ dravid kisi patibaddhta se bache lekin unhone is saal ipel main rajasthan royles ke saath apni bhoomika kii ore ishaara kiya jab vah team ke captain sah-menter the
 He said, "I don't know

 i do not have the certificates of level one, two and three that people sometimes ask for
 ’’ dravid ne kaha, ‘‘is saal yah rajasthan royles ke saath meri bhoomika kaa hissaa tha
 It is slightly more than leadership capacity
 main iske ranneeti or koching ke hisse se judaa tha or iskaa puraa lutf uthaaya
 Dravid, who was among the Bhadras of the game, revealed that during his 16-year international career, he had lost his restraint on a few occasions
 dravid ne kaha, ‘‘dressing room kii niztaa ke dauraan main kabhi kabhi apni bhaawanaaon ko bahane detaa hum
 i don't get angry very soon but sometimes there comes a time when i get frustrated with myself, maybe after playing a bad shot, after being dismissed, i have also damaged some of my stuff
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘mujhe lagata he ki 20 saal ke dauraan aap kam se kam ek yaa do baar to mujhe aisa karne kii ijaajat doge
 "it is difficult for a player with multiple match-winning innings to pick a good innings but Dravid called his double century against Australia in Adelaide one of his best innings
" unhone kaha, ‘‘main puri pari ke dauraan jis tarah khelaa or jis tarah main niyantran main tha, mujhe lagata he ki yah meri sarvshereshth pariyon main se ek he
 Considering that Australia had scored over 550 runs, but to be fair, it was a good batting wicket
 ’’ edilade test main chakka markar shatak puraa karne ke bare main dravid ne kaha, ‘‘main kabhi chakka nahin maarna chahta tha
 That's it

 Asked about the ability to bat in any order and in any role, Dravid said, "as i said earlier, this team is a great part of the game
" main skool main hockey team kaa hissaa tha, footbal bhi khelaa
 One challenge for me was to make the team feel good

 Today we got a chance to see the palace in Lhasa, in which the fourteenth Dalai Lama spent three summers from 1956 to 1959
 ye mahal narbulinka main bana he
 Narbulinka means Treasure Garden or Treasure Park, which was built by the seventh Dalai Lama Kelsang Gyatso in the mid-18th century
 is park ko 20veen sadi tak bada or behatar kiya jaataa rahaa
 Spread over 36 hectares, the park has 400 different rooms
 hare bhare or phulon se laden isi park main 1952 main chaudaaven dalai lamas ke liye mahal banane kaa kaam shuru hua jo 1956 main puraa hua
 It is also known as the Summer Palace of the Dalai Lama
 isse pehle potalaa pales dalai lamas kaa nivas hua karata tha
 Some experts say that the Dalai Lama was shifted to a new and relatively small palace due to a rift with the Chinese government
 lekin kuch is theory ko galat bataate hai
 It was only in 1959 that the Dalai Lama left Tibet in Tibet to protest against China's 'democratic Reform' and then began to live in exile in India
 tab se ye mahal khaali padaa he
 However, those Tibetans who accuse China of seizing Tibet have said that it was because of China's intervention that the Dalai Lama had to leave Tibet and take refuge in India
 iske baad chini sarkaar ne ise aam sailaaniyon ke liye khol diya he
 a large number of followers of the Dalai Lama also visit here
 acchhee baat ye he ki yahaan dalai lamas se judi har chiz rakhi hui he, sivaae unki kisi tasviir ke
 Pilgrims go from the throne of the Dalai Lama to his sitting room and bow his head
 yaheen hamaari mulaaqaat maathaa tekti ek aisi tibeti mahila se hui jo hindi jaanati thi
 He told India on seeing us
 hamane unase dalai lamas ke bare main poocha to usne sirf itnaa kaha, ve jahaan bhi rahen thik rahen
 Here we also saw a large size radio which was given by the first Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru as a gift to the Dalai Lama
 dilachasp baat yah he ki ye abhi bhi chaalu haalat main he, haalanki iskaa istemaal sirf numaaish ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 a large painting from Nehru in the gift still adorns the Dalai Lama's room in which he used to meet the guests
 yahaan lhasa kii kai manestry kii tarah andar ke kamaron main photographi kii manaahi he
 That is why we are not able to bring you a picture of these things
