 vishwa vyapaar sarleekaran ke prati patibaddhta vyakt karte hue pradhanmantri narendra modi ne raashtrapati baraak obama ke saath baatcheet main kaha ki vishwa vyapaar sanghathan kii baatcheet main bharat kii khaadya suraksha sambandhi chintaaon kaa samaadhaan nikaala janaa chahie
 At the time of making a joint statement with Obama after the summit, Modi said, "the WTO issue was discussed openly
" ham vyapaar sarleekaran kaa samarthan karte hai, par saath hi ham chaahate hai ki hamaari khaadya suraksha chintaaon kaa samaadhaan hona chahie or ham ummid karte hai ki aisa sheeghra hoga
 Significantly, at the WTO meeting held in Geneva in July, India took a tough stance on the issue of food security and refused to ratify the wto's Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA)
 is samjhaute ko sweekaar karne ke liye viksit desh dabaav banaae hue hai, haalanki khaadya suraksha ke uddeshy se bharat ke saarvajanik khadyann bhandaaran ke mudde kaa sthaayee samaadhaan kiye bina vah aisa dabaav bana rahe hai
 India has asked the WTO to amend the modalities for calculating agricultural subsidies in case of purchasing foodgrains at minimum support price and selling it to the poor at cheap prices
 dablutio ke maujuuda niyamon main khaadya sabsidi ko khadyann utpaadan ke kul mulya kaa 10 pratishat par simit kiya gaya he
 Along with this, there is a provision to calculate the subsidy at the price of two decades ago
 bharat khaadya sabsidi kii gananaa ke liye khadyann mulya ke aadhaar varsh 1986-88 ko badalane kii maang kar rahaa he
 India wants the subsidy calculation to be changed in the base year keeping in mind various aspects, such as inflation and currency fluctuations
 aisi ashanka he ki jaise hi bharat apane khaadya suraksha kaarykram ko puri tarah lagu karegaa sabsidi kaa ankada dablutio dwaara nirdhaarit 10 pratishat kii seemaa se adhik ho jayega
 If this happens, a member country of the WTO, if it complains against India, can face a heavy fine
 modi ne kaha, dablutio kii bali main hui mantristareey baithak main kaaphi khulkar charchaa ho chuki he, bharat vyapaar sarleekaran kaa samarthan karata he
 But, i hope we will be able to find a solution that will address our concerns on food security
 meraa maananaa he ki yah jald karnaa sambhav he
 There was a lot of emphasis on economic issues during the meeting
 modi ne kaha, raashtrapati or maine hamaari kai saajha aarthik praathamiktaaon par baat kii
 i am confident that India will achieve rapid economic growth and will see a lot of change
 ham bharat main keval nitiyon par dhyaan nahin de rahe hai balki prakriyaaon par bhi gaur kar rahe hai taaki bharat main kaamkaaj karnaa aasaan or utpaadak bane
 The Prime Minister said, President Obama has also supported me in terms of constant openness and easy access to the US market for Indian service sector companies

 Eminent writer Narendra Kohli said that the religion of literature is to stand in favor of the victim
 ‘sahitya ajtak’ke duusare din 'sahitya kaa dharm’ satr main puranic kathakaar narendra kohli ne yah baat kahi

 lekin rishi unke bich main aa jaataa he
 He said that sages are today as intellectuals
 to isi tarah sahityakar kaa dharm he, yadi uske saamne atyaachaar ho rahaa he, to us bich main use padana he yaa nahin is par vichaar karnaa he
 Many people wonder why should i fall in between, what can i do
 lekin kuch log aise hai jo sochate hai ki main jo kar saktaa hum karuunga, chaahe shraap hi dena kyon na ho, main bich main dakhal duungaa
 The writer has got an extraordinary job to stand in favor of the victim and against the victim

 The struggle of the demon and the sages
 He asked why the demon used to eat the sage, because he was an intellectual
 ramayana kii kahani kii baat karen to vanar asal main dalit, vanchit log the
 He got Buddhist leadership from the sages

 He stated his point in Tanja that even today the first four pages of newspapers are filled with the story of demons
 unhone kaha, 'ham na to un saadhaaran shabdon ke peeche jaaen jo sahitya kaa ang nahin ban sakate or na hi apane shabdon ko un logon ke liye barbaad karen jo uske yogya nahin he
 'in Indian poetry, literature does not speak of religion, but of purpose
 yash lekhak ko miltaa he, arth lekhak ko miltaa he, vyavhaar lekhak ko miltaa he
 Whatever is not in the interest of society, it has to be eliminated
 shiv ko samaaj main samaapt karnaa he, shiv se itar jo he usko samaapt karnaa he
 Narendra Kohli is one of the most popular Hindi storytellers

 On this, Cali turned back and asked PM Modi the question whether you are on Twitter
 is par piem modi hanse or jawaab main kaha- haa

 ' The ruling BJP on Tuesday hinted at the next step, with Parliament approving the historic bill dividing Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories
 or wo he puure ilaake ke nirvachan kshetron ko phir se nirdhaarit karnaa
 BJP general secretary Ram Madhav indicated in an exclusive interview to India Today TV that the 'long pending' delimitation process in Jammu and Kashmir will be done in the 'right perspective'
 ram madhav ne kaha, ham nishchit rup se parisemen kii prakriya ko puraa karnaa chaahate hai
 It is part of the bill (which Parliament passed)
 "vartmaan main, jammu or kashmir main 87 vidhansabha or chah loksabhaa kshetra hai
 Of these, the valley has 46 assembly constituencies and three parliamentary constituencies
 ek loksabhaa seat or chaar vidhansabha siton vaale ladakh main centre shasit pradesh ke rup main koi vidhansabha nahin hogi
 Therefore, whatever the process of delimitation will be, the focus is mainly on the new union territory of Jammu and Kashmir
 ram madhav kii haal philhal main pahchaan jammu or kashmir main party kii niti kaa netritv karne vaale shaks ke taur par rahi he
 BJP general secretary Ram Madhav said, "we are keen that the delimitation process will be taken into the right perspective
" "ram madhav kii ye tippaniyan modi sarkaar kii ore se raashtrapatiya aadesh ke jariye jammu or kashmir kaa vishesh darja khatm karne kaa kadam uthaane ke ek din baad ain
 However, Madhav did not speculate on the dates for a new election in the new union territory Jammu and Kashmir
 madhav ne kaha, ''chunaav kab karaane hai ye faisla chunaav ayog ko lenaa he
 Ideally, i think they too have to wait for the delimitation process to end
 "dhara 370 hatane ke baad kii ranneetibijapi netaa ne jammu or kashmir ke vishesh darje ko hataane ke baad ghati main sambhavit ashaanti kii atakalon ko khaarij kiya
 He described it as mere propaganda
 ram madhav ne kaha, "qayamat ke din kii bhavishyavaanee karne vaale aise netaa hai jinke liye dhara 370 roji-roti kaa mudda rahaa he
 They will make all kinds of predictions
 lekin pichley 24 ghanton se jammu main jashn chal rahaa he or ladakh main apaar khushi kaa maahaul he
 "madhav insisted," There is no adverse result from the valley, there is a lot of silence
 "madhav ke mutabik unki party aam kashmiriyon tak pahunch kar unhen bataaegi ki nae kadamon se unhen kaise "laabh" hoga
 Madhav said, "I am sure that if the right message goes to them, then people will realize that whatever the Government of India has done or is doing, it is really going to give huge benefits to the common people of the valley
 
 ham nishchit rup se ghati ke logon ko samajhane kii koshish karenge
 However, the BJP leader made it clear that the security agencies would be on alert at all times to deal with any untoward situation
 raajnneetik giraftaaryanmadhav ne jammu or kashmir ke purv mukhyamantriyon- mahabuuba mufti or umr abdulla kii najarbandi ko aihtiyaati kadam bataaya
 Madhav said, "it was a precautionary step
 sarkaar ke liye yah sunishchit karnaa aavashyak he ki koi vipareet nattejey saamne nahin aaen
 For political leaders, precautionary arrests are a common practice
 mujhe yakeen he ki unke saath puure sammaan or garima kaa vyavhaar kiya jayega
 There is nothing that needs to be bothered about
 ”koi bahari dabaav nahimbijapi mahasachiv ne jammu-kashmir par sarkaar ke kadam ke peeche kisi bhi "bahari kaaran" hone ke kayaason ko kaarij kiya
 When Madhav was asked if India was influenced by the public statements of US President Donald Trump, he said, "as i know my leaders, i can tell you, there is no external reason for the thinking or decisions of leaders like Modi ji
 Can not impress
 kisi bhi maamle mentrump kii madhyasthata kii peshkash ke sawaal par, bharat sarkaar ne apni sthiti spasht kar di ki kabhi bhi aise kisi dakhal kii maang nahin kii gai
 "why the rating of Union Territory? When asked why Jammu and Kashmir was converted into Union Territory, he said that it was necessary to take a different step for complete integration of the region with Indian Union
" madhav ne kaha, "somvaar tak, vipaksh kii daleel thi ki jammu or kashmir bharat ke or rajyon jaisaa nahin he
 When it is not like other states of India, it should be dealt with differently
 yahi ham kar rahe hai
 In the process of making it like any other state in the country
 hamen kuch pragatisheel kadam uthaane kii jarurat he
 It will later also get full statehood
 "madhav ne pashchimi pados main ubharne vaali bhugolic raajnneetik sthitiyon kaa bhi zikr kiya
 Madhav said, "I am not connected with the decision (union Territory) but i can only surmise that a specific situation is developing in the west of our country

 Interestingly, Pakistan is a party, America is a party, Russia is a party, China is a party and we are not

 "madhav ne yah bhi jor diya ki bijepi apane maujuuda kaarykaal main ram mandir or uniform civil code ke vaadon ko puraa karne kii ore bhi agrasar hogi
 Madhav said, "I am sure that in the next three-four years, we will make a lot of progress towards bringing these issues (ram Mandir and Common Civil Code) to a decisive position
 madhav ne chutki ke andaaz main kaha, “sambhawatah 2024 main hamen nae khambhon kii talash kerani hogi
 We will be able to fulfill our key promises that we have made to the people in the last six-seven decades

 Madhav said, “we follow the constitution with all its spirit while implementing any decision

 He (modi) is a man with courage and strong intentions

 He said that he was stunned by the then Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's remark in 1999 in which he said that Kashmir issue can be resolved
 sharif ne kaha ki vaajapeyi ne lambey samay se vivaadit kashmir mudde ke samaadhaan ke liye parde ke peeche kii kootneeti kaa prastaav diya tha or yah prakriya shuru hi hone vaali thi lekin ‘kargil sankat kii vajah se is prayaas ko gaharaa dhakka laga

 Sharif said that he regretted the most that he could not control the powerful army during the 1990s
 unhone kaha ki do may ko america abhiyaan ke dauraan al kaayda pramukh osama bin laden ke maare jane kii sansad dwaara prastaav paarit kar ek swatantra ayog se jaanch karaaye jane kii maang sansad ko samprabhu banane kii disha main uthaaya gaya pehla kadam he

 The pitch at Trentbridge had been the subject of discussion and if the pitch of Lord's had not changed dramatically, the two teams would land with five bowlers
 bharat ne pehle test match main stuart binni ko pehla test khilne kaa mauka diya tha lekin pich ke kaaran yah medium pesar apni swing gendbaaji kaa sahi pradarshan nahin sakaa tha
 However, Binny batted well in the second innings and scored a half-century to get India out of the crisis

 The possibility is that the Indian team once again enters the match with the same XI

 Kohli also worked with fielding coach Trevor Penny
 paini ne ek khaas line va length par unhen thro down se abhyaas karaayaa
 The Indian team does not give any indication from such a practice session but two days before the match it can be said that it will stick to the strategy of landing with five bowlers
 iske saath hi lag rahaa he ki binni or jadeja ko aswin par tarjeeh di jaaegi
 The Lord's pitch looks green but by the time of the toss, its greenery can be removed
 match aage badhane ke saath yah wicket sapaat ho jaataa he or isliye yadi bharat apane antim ekadash main badlaav nahin karata to phir kisi ko hairaani nahin honi chahie
 In such a situation, there will be more pressure on the top five batsmen and Dhoni will come at number six
 england ke saath bhi yahi sthiti he lekin uske nichle kram ke ballebaaj acchhee ballebaaji kar sakate hai
 The top nine batsmen of his team playing in Trentbridge have a Test century in their names
 england ke ballebaaj gairi balance ne kaha, ‘pich kaaphi dhimi hai or aise main atirikt gendbaaj ke saath khelnaa jaruri he
 We saw at Trentbridge that we and the Indian fast bowlers bowled a lot
 ek atirikt gendbaaj nahin hone ke kaaran hamen vahaan sangharsh karnaa padaa
 This puts pressure on the batsmen but it is our job to score runs and the pressure is always there

 35 saal tak ek duusare ke kattar pratidwandvi rahe mayawati (basapa)-akhilesh yadav (sapa) kaa yah gathbandhan, jise buaa-bhatija gathbandhan bhi kaha ja rahaa he, game-changer sabit ho saktaa he
 a senior BJP leader in Lucknow says, "after this alliance, two words 'substitute' and 'hawa' suggest a change in the political mood of the state
" march 2017 main bhaajapa ne vidhansabha chunaav main prachand jeet darj kii or yogi adityanath mukhyamantri bane, tab rajya main bhaajapa vikalp thi
 Now the SP-BSP alliance is the main option
 lihaaja, hawa kaa rukh badal gaya he
 "after March 2017, the discouragement of the SP-BSP activists has turned into hope
" virdohi ise mahaj jati kaa gathbandhan kah sakate hai—pradhanmantri narendra modi ne to ise 'aise logon kaa gathbandhan' bataaya, jinhen unhone ''desh ko luutane se roak rakhaa he
 "but the reality is that SP-BSP pre-coalition elections can create a new history
" uttar pradesh kii 75 pratishat aabaadi kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaala obisi jatiyon, daliton or musalamaanon kaa yah indradhanushi saamaajik gathbandhan, desh main 2019 ke siyaasi mukaable main nirnaayak mode sabit hoga
 When elections are being held all over the country, why so much focus on Uttar Pradesh only? Remember, this state with the largest population of 80 parliamentary seats plays the pivot role in the country's politics
 ab tak 14 pradhanmantriyon main se nau isi rajya ne die hai
 In 2014, one-fourth of the BJP mps were from here
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne isi pradesh (varanasi) se chunaav ladaa to congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi (amethi) bhi yaheen se ladate hai
 Sonia Gandhi also contests from Rae Bareli here and on 23 January Priyanka Gandhi was made Congress General Secretary with charge of Eastern Uttar Pradesh from where Congress won more than a dozen Lok Sabha seats in 2009

 Scene 2
 kolkata
 On January 19, the leaders of 22 political parties, including three current Chief Ministers, some former Chief Ministers, former cabinet ministers of NDA-1 and a former Prime Minister, gathered in a huge 'united India' rally at the Brigade Parade Ground in Kolkata and competed against the BJP and its allies
 Laid the foundation for a new Grand Alliance
 raily kii aayojak pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri tathaa trinmul congress kii netaa mamata banerjee ne elaan kiya, ''badal do, badal do, dilli main sarkaar badal do
 All opposition parties should support bjp's most powerful opponent in Harlok Sabha seat
 modi sarkaar apni expyri date par pahunch gai he
 Last fortnight, Lucknow and Kolkata emerged as powerful symbols of national politics
 may 2018 main karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ke baad bangaluru mahagathbandhan kii jhaanki pesh kar rahaa tha or lakhanu main uttar pradesh ke liye ek majboot gathbandhan kii neenv rakhi gai, to kolkata kii raily ne mahagathbandhan kii imaarat ke liye pukhta aadhaar taiyaar kar diya he
 Mamta said in her inaugural address, "many leaders of different parties are on this platform, it seems that the whole country has turned against the BJP
" sabhi ko ek saath aana hoga or hamen har kisi kaa majbootee se samarthan karnaa hoga
 Collective leadership is important
 ''pashchim bengal main mamata ke pramukh pratidwandviyon vampanthi dalon ko chhodkar lagbhag sabhi pramukh vipakshi partiyon ne is 'united india' raily main apni maujuudagi darj kii
 He also made a joint announcement that many such rallies will be organized in other states in the coming days
 telugudesham ke adhyaksh tathaa andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu ne kaha ki ve rajya kii rajdhani amravati main vishaal raily kii yojana bana rahe hai
 Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal also indicated similar events in Delhi ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in 2019
 karnataka se lakhanu, kolkata se amravati or dilli tak mahagathbandhan kii yojana desh ke pramukh rajyon main majboot chunaav-purv gathbandhan or chunaav baad gathbandhan ko aakaar dene kii he
 Will such an alliance be a game changer in Uttar Pradesh and across the country in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections? Can a grand alliance be formed from Lucknow to Kolkata, Hyderabad to Jammu and Kashmir that will challenge the Modi-led NDA in May 2019? The mood of the country, about 100 days before the general election, seems to reflect
 kya rajyon main vipakshi dalon ke gathbandhan asann chunaav main bhaajapa ke netritv vaale endie ke liye gambhir chunauti hai? deshbhar main surveykshan main 60 pratishat logon ne iskaa uttar 'haa' main diya or sirf 26 pratishat kaa uttar 'naa' he
 The pre-election scenario: The alliance is still in the process of being formed and alliances are still being formed, in such a way, 'the state's land survey is three possible scenarios of the battlefield of Uttar Pradesh, four possible scenarios of the entire country and finally two in the country after the election Estimates a possible scenario 
 ye paridrishy kaalpanik hai, jo ganitiya sambhaavnaaon or vot tathaa seat hissedari ke anumaanon par aadhaarit hai
 Uttar Pradesh Scenario Scenario 1: This is the most realistic scenario in view of today's situation
 bhaajapa kaa apana dal ke saath gathbandhan he
 In 2014, this alliance got 73 seats in Uttar Pradesh
 duusari ore ab sapa, basapa or ralod ke bich gathbandhan he, jiskaa aupchaarik elaan 12 janvari ko hua
 The Congress is fighting as the Third Front and is trying to tie up with Shivpal Yadav's Progressive Samajwadi Party and some other smaller players
 so, maujuuda sthiti ke maddenjar desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan kaa anumaan he ki sapa-basapa-ralod gathbandhan 46 pratishat vot share ke saath 58 siten jeet saktaa he
 The BJP and its allies will be reduced to just 18 seats with 36 percent votes
 congress ko sahyogiyon ke saath 12
 Four seats can be obtained with 5 percent of the vote
 jaahir he, sapa-basapa-ralod gathbandhan sabase adhik phaayde main najar aa rahaa he
 Here the Cube rule applies that the seats for the largest player are geometrically proportionate in terms of vote share
 iske vipareet, congress 2014 ke mukaable vot share main vruddhi ke saath keval chaar siton par jeet darj kar sakati he or teen-tarafa mukaable main yah sabase choti khilaadi he
 Of course, the BJP is the worst loser and may come in second place
 paridrishy 2:agar sabhi vipakshi gaiyr-bhaajapa dal ek adarsh dharmanirpeksh gathbandhan bana len, jisase alpsankhyakon ke 19 pratishat vot na banten
 That means the Congress should join the SP-BSP-RLD alliance
 endie main pehle kii tarah bhaajapa or apana dal rahete hai
 In the face of such an ideal coalition of the opposition, the opposition will win 75 seats in a two-way contest with 58 percent vote share while the NDA will be reduced to just five seats with 36 percent of the vote
 paridrishy 3:agar sabhi chaaron bade dal—bhaajapa, sapa, basapa or congress apane dam par alag-alag laden to kya hoga? bhaajapa 35 fisadi voton ke saath 57 siten, sapa 24 fisadi voton ke saath 16 siten, basapa 21 fisadi vot ke saath ek seat or congress chaar siton par jeet darj kar sakati he
 So, why does the BJP seem to be losing both seats and votes despite an all-round contest? In fact, due to the dual anti-incumbency wind due to Modi at the center and Adityanath's government in Lucknow, BJP got about 7
 5 pratishat voton kaa nuksaan hota dikh rahaa he
 However, when analyzing the personal popularity of the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister, resentment against the state government is more than that of the central government
 desh main chunaav-purv paridrishymukhya paridrishyah maujuuda halaat ke mutabik yah desh main sabase vaastavik paridrishy he (dekhen aalekh, muqabla kaante kaa)
 Accordingly, the NDA is likely to get 237 seats with 35 percent of the votes in the scuffle; The UPA (along with Telugu Desam, Congress and others) can get 166 seats with 33 percent votes while others (SP, BSP, Trinamool and other smaller parties) can win 140 seats with 32 percent votes
 nateezaah trishanku loksabhaa kyonki koi bhi sarkaar banane ke liye jaruri 543 main se nunatam 272 siten nahin hasil kar saktaa
 Scenario 1: If BSP-SP-RLD and Trinamool join the Congress-led UPA, what is the probability of votes and seats? The NDA will win 219 seats with 35 percent votes, while the UPA will win 269 seats with 44 percent votes and 55 seats with another 21 percent votes
 lekin yah sambhaavna agar vaastavik nahin he to phir is par vichaar hi kyon karen? kahawat he, : 'ekta main bal he ', congress ke netritv vaala upie or sapa-basapa-ralod-trinmul ke mahagathbandhan ke bich antatru hode se ek-duusare kaa nuksaan hoga or aakhirkaar endie ke liye sthiti phaayde main rahegi
 Scenario 2: What if AIADMK and YSR Congress join NDA and join Mehbooba Mufti-led PDP UPA? The rest of the scenarios are exactly the same as in Scenario 1
 endie ke 40 pratishat maton ke saath 234 siten jeetne kii sambhaavna he, jabaki upie ko 44 pratishat maton ke saath 272 siten milane kii sambhaavna he
 Clearly, even with the PDP, the upa's vote share does not increase but some of its seats increase, bringing it closer to the majority needed to form the government
 paridrishy 3:kya hoga agar naveen patnayak ke netritv vaale biju janata dal or ke
 Join TRS NDA led by Chandrasekhar Rao? The answer is very confusing: the NDA will only get a nominal benefit by coming with them and will be able to get only 257 seats
 donon pratidwandviyon ko 44 fisadi vot milenge phir bhi upie sarkaar banane ke liye jaruri 272 ke nishaan ko paar karne kii sthiti main hoga
 Others are getting around 14 seats with 12 percent votes
 spasht rup se, endie gathbandhan ko satta virdohi rujhaan kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, jaisaa ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main upie ko karnaa padaa tha
 This means that in all the three scenarios, NDA is expected to get some edge only in the first place
 chunaav baad ke do paridrishyakya hoga agar agle 100 dinon main chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan is chunaav-purv paridrishy main koi badlaav nahin hota? desh main rajnatik khiladinnon kii sankhya or sambhavit samikarnon ke aadhaar par chunaav baad kai tarah ke paridrishyon kii kalpana kii ja sakati he
 To ease the understanding and simplify the possible scenarios, the mood survey of the country considered only two scenarios: Scenario 1: If we consider the actual main scenario to a large extent the pre-election picture is correct, with 237 seats
 The NDA will need 35 additional mps to form the government
 use dakshin ke sambhavit sahyogiyon jaise andhra pradesh kii viesar congress, tamilnadu kii annadramuk, telugana kii tiares, purv main odisha ke bijd ke samarthan kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Scenario 2: If we consider the very real main scenario of pre-election to be a practical picture to form the government, then the UPA with 166 seats will get 48 seats apart from 58 seats from potential allies like sp-bsp-ralod
 This will be needed only with the support of the BJD and other minor players
 aise main sarkaar par sahyogiyon kaa dabaav bhi adhik rahegaa
 The bottom line is that the political phase of alliances has returned and this could become a problem for Prime Minister Modi
 unki ghatati lokapriyata ke saath, janamat surveykshanon se pataa chalata he ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ke netritv vaale endie ko purna bahumat se peeche rahanaa pad saktaa he
 This has prompted the country's opposition parties to forget their ideological differences and unite
 lekin 2019 kii duvidha yah bhi he ki endie, upie yaa mahagathbandhan apane dam par sarkaar nahin bana sakate
 Each player will need the support of at least one other alliance
 maujuuda paristhitiyon main, mahagathbandhan or congress ke netritv vaale upie ke liye behatar yahi hoga ki ve chunaav baad gathbandhan kii bajaae, chunaav-purv gathbandhan banane kii koshish karen
 Political stability and stability will also be more in the pre-election alliance
 *** a government committee reviewing the functioning of deemed universities has found that some institutes are running a variety of distance courses without permission

 The governments of the two countries blamed each other for the cancellation of the talks and while there should have been a serious dialogue on terrorism, there was a game of throwing mud on each other
 us aatankwaad par jisaki vajah se seemaa paar donon hi ore hajaaron logon kii hatya kaa tandav ab bhi jari he
 The diplomacy of the press conference first came to light: Pakistan's National Security Advisor Sartaj Aziz hoisted the files in front of reporters on 22 August, alleging that Indian intelligence agencies were traumatized not only in Balochistan but in December 2014 in Peshawar's school
 Are also included in iske kuch hi ghanton ke baad videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne pakistan ke liye dedline nirdhaarit karte hue poocha ki vah baithak ke liye madhya raatri tak bhartiya aamantran kaa jawaab de
 Soon after the cancellation of the meeting, the two countries started communicating to the foreign media

 Jaishankar invited a large number of Western press on 24 August, while Pakistani High Commissioner Abdul Basit did so the next day
 bharat ke liye videshi media tak apni baat ko rakhana behad jaruri tha kyonki 28 sitambar ko neuyork main pradhanmantri narendra modi america ke raashtrapati baraak obama se milane vaale hai
 While the world is shaken by the collapse of China's market, Modi conditionally wants to repeat the story of India's extraordinary democracy
 yah unki ore se shanti or sthayitv kaa rambaan he
 But Modi may soon realize that his big allies and intermediary forces of the world are distracted by some other crisis
 ab jabaki america afghanistan se haath khinch chukaa he, do saal pehle hi mullah umr ke maare jane kii ghoshnaa or pakistan ke is baat ko gupt rakhane ne america kii niraashaa or rawalpindi par uski nirbharta ko badhaayaa hi he
 a year ago, when Modi came to power, he hoped that he would not only fulfill India's economic ambitions but lead the pending integration of South Asia
 ek ore jahaan bharat ke liye modi kii videsh niti kii mahatvakanksha ne unhen kaaphi badhat dilaai, isaki tulana main pakistan niti ke masale par ve koi sandesh nahin de sake
 Perhaps it is because of the RSS that has traditionally held anti-views towards Pakistan
 isliye pichley saal may main apane shapath grahan samaaroh main navaj sharif ko aamantrit karne kaa safar is agast kii 23-24 taarikh ko enese str kii baatcheet ke liye ajij ke dilli daure ko radd karne main badal gaya kyonki ve hurriyat netaaon ke saath bhi baithak karne par ade hue the
 There is another aspect of this crisis which few people know
 yah he rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal or sushamaa swaraj ke bich chupchaap chal rahaa takat kaa khel
 During the last one year, Doval was seen behind him in every major foreign policy initiative of the Prime Minister
 lekin 22 agast ko ajij kii press conference kaa jawaab dene ke liye bhartiya pratinidhitiv kii baari ai to modi ne dobhaal kii bajaae swaraj ko tarjeeh di
 On the top, Modi's selection seemed correct as Swaraj gave a befitting reply to Pakistan
 lekin apni vakpatutaa ke saath-saath swaraj ne khud hi seemaa rekha khinch di
 For example, he told a journalist that the deadline for Pakistan to respond is midnight of August 22, "the time when the date changes in the English calendar
" ” par ek adhikari ke mutabik unako “yah samaysima dene ke liye hari jhandi nahin mili thi
 "did Swaraj go beyond the extent of her briefing, this officer refused to say
 iske kuch din pehle jab pakistan ne 14 agast ko bharat ke prastaavit agenda par baatcheet ke liye jawaab diya tha, to yah kaanaafoosee thi ki pakistan ne bharat ko suchit kiya tha ki ajij apane bhartiya samakaksh ke saath-saath swaraj se milane ke icchhuk hai
 But Indian officials did not respond to this
 yahaan tak ki 22 agast ko ajij kii press conference ke baad bhi kai logon kaa maananaa tha ki hurriyat netaaon se milane yaa na milane ke naatakeey prasang ke baavjood unhone dilli kii baithak main aane kaa darwaja abhi khulaa rakhaa he
 When Aziz was asked if it was possible for him to meet with Hurriyat leaders after talking to Doval in Delhi, his answer was yes and the Doval camp breathed a sigh of relief
 isliye jab swaraj ne aadhi raat kii samaysima uchhaali to isane ajij kii yatra kii sambhaavna khatm kar daali
 Saying that Swaraj's tough attitude towards Pakistan hits the Prime Minister's perspective, an official admits, "what Sushma Swaraj did was a little further than Modi
 ” adhikari ne yah bhi joda ki swaraj ne press conference main kai galtiyaan kin jinamein hurriyat netaaon ko “teesri party” bataanaa shaamil he
 On July 10, in a joint statement in Ufa, an Indian strategist interpreted the missing reference to "jammu and Kashmir" as "the real flaw" i

 "modi team's inability to Ufa, which provided the enemy a means to hide their face" It does
 ”aisa mana jaataa he ki upha main modi or sharif kii baithak acchhee rahi thi
 Even Sharif made a joke in reference to Modi's speech in Dhaka this summer
 vahaan yah samaj banati najar ai ki bharat-pakistan kii baatcheet kii bahaali siyaasi taur par sharif kii madad karegi
 This meant that renegotiations on the Kashmir dispute and other issues would resume in the meeting of the National Security Advisors
 lekin saaf taur par na to pakistani videsh sachiv ejaj ahamed choudhary or na hi jaishankar ne kamjor paksh kaa cheharaa bachaane kii jarurat mahasoos kii
 Jaishankar had never been concerned about talks with Pakistan before
 bharat ne saajha bayaan main “jammu or kashmir” se jude kisi zikr ke bina mumbai maamle ke aaropee kaa sandarbh hasil kar liya tha
 Sharif was seen to be weakening more than this triumphant India
 apni sena kii ore se pehle hi alag-thalag kar die jane ke baad ve upha main apane rukh kaa bachaav karne main samarth nahin the
 In such a question, what will happen now? Officials say that on September 9, a meeting of the directors general of BSF and Pakistani Rangers will be held as per the schedule
 dobhaal or ajij kii baithak sitambar ke aakhri dinon main neuyork main hone kii sambhaavna he, tab tak bheed kii sanak tham jaaegi
 But in fact, the Modi government has probably shook its Pakistan policy in a corner by shutting it in the box
 agast, 2014 main videsh sachiv str kii baatcheet radd hone ke 11 maah baad upha kii baithak hui thi
 How much time will it take this time: Until Pakistan softens or becomes friendly to them? Is India and Pakistan separated at the time of their birth 68 years ago? Are they guilty of repeating their old bitter theatrical spectacle again and again? chhuttiyon ke kaaran kam kaarobaari satr vaale aagaamee saptaah main gharelu aarthik aankade or videshi niveshkon kaa nivesh kaa rukh bazaar main kaarobaar kii disha nirdhaarit karegaa

 aisa 1933 ke baad pehali baar hua he ki bhartiya cricket team yahaan koi test khel rahi he or antim ekadash main mumbai kaa koi cricketer nahin he
 Although Mumbai player Sharadul Thakur is in the team but he could not get a chance in the playing XI

 mumbai ke ajinkya rahane chot ke kaaran baahar do maichon se baahar ho gaye hai jabaki mohammad shami ke cover ke taur par bulaaye gaye thakur ko bhi plaing ilevan main mauka nahin mil sakaa he

 Similarly, Rohit Sharma of Mumbai, who is becoming a regular member of the test team, is currently out of cricket due to injury

 There has been a time when Mumbai players used to be dominated in Team India, but this number gradually decreased over time
 bambe gymkhana main 1933 main hue test ke baad se bhartiya team ne yahaan aisa koi test nahin khelaa he jisamen antim ekadash main mumbai kaa koi cricketer nahin rahaa ho
 Mumbai's Ajinkya Rahane has been ruled out for two matches due to injury while Thakur, who was called as the cover of Mohammed Shami, could not get a chance in the playing eleven

 Shyam Dev Rai Choudhary, a seven-time MLA from city Dakshin for damage control, was called by BJP President Amit Shah to Delhi

 But Dada's heart was not hurt due to the ticket being cut
 to piem modi khud maidan main kud pade
 His last three-day stay was fixed here
 or jaise hi piem ke teen din kaa kaarykram aayaa
 Similarly, the entire program of police and administration turned into a challenge
 pehle din yani 14 taarikh ko piem kaa kaarykram mandir darshan karne jane kaa tha
 And on the same day, the road show of CM Akhilesh and Rahul Gandhi was pre-decided
 donon kaa samay or rasta ek hi tha
 So the police and the public's sweat began to sweat
 ise kaise sakushal sampann karaayaa jaye isaki chunauti saamne aa gai
 The road show route was first inspected
 phir 13 taarikh kii puri raat jagakar jiladhikari yogeshwar ram mishra or police captain nitin tiwari ne jagah-jagah bairicating karai
 Every roof falling on the way was reviewed by a drone camera
 bam skhwaid daste ne chappe-chappe par chaanbin kii
 Anti Mine was involved in the investigation of every suspicious item in the Skeffer Dog area
 iske baad bheed kahin aage na aa jaye isliye 6000 javaanon ko lagbhag 3 kilometre rassi de kar dauty main tainaat kiya gaya
 After this night-long exercise, that morning on the 14th came when PM Modi was supposed to come
 unka kaarykram pehle 12 baje kaa tha or siem kaa 1 baje kaa
 In such a situation, when there was one root, there was bound to be conflict
 lihaaja prashasan ne pehle piem ke program ko aagrah kar 9 baje kaa karaayaa or siem kaa 2 baje kaa
 After this effort, the administration breathed a little relief
 lekin jab piem aaye to wo biechayu ke lanka get se khuli jeep se mandir kaa 5 kilometre kaa rasta tay karne nikle
 a large amount of information about the pm's program was printed in newspapers, so the crowd gathered to welcome him
 bijepi ke logon ne bhi pehle se taiyaari kar rakhi thi
 Baskets of flowers were delivered everywhere
 jo piem par varsha karne ke liye thi
 The PM caravan moved forward, but it turned into an informal road show because one PM walked in the open tax and the other slowed down due to heavy crowd
 jisase mandir pahunchane main ghanton lag gaye
 Prime Minister Modi arrived at the Vishwanath temple around 1 o'clock and started worshiping from there and it took more than 2 to go to Kalabhairav
 ab kachhari se siem akhilesh or rahul gandhi kaa bhi road sho shuru ho gaya
 In such a situation, the administration started to sweat
 donon taraf ke julus ke liye prasashan ne force tainaat kar rakhi thi
 By dividing the path of the entire road show into 12 sectors, the administration continued to maintain the coordination of the police force with 13 SP, 12 ASP, 45 CO, DM and SSP
 is bich prasashan ne dohari vyavastha bhi kar rakhi thi 
 a separate route was also made so that VIP could be removed through another route if there was any talk
 baharhaal in vyavastha ke bich badi baat ye thi ki piem ke raste main siem kaa road sho aane se pehle
 The pm's program had to be completed by leaving it safe
 aakhirkaar 3 baje ke lagbhag piem ja kaarykram khatm hua tab tak siem kaa kaaravaan ek chauthai duuri puri jaar chukaa tha
 But now the administration had won half the battle
 par abhi mushkil khatm nahin hui thi
 And a big challenge came when the convoy of CM and Rahul reached near the Chaukaghat water tank when a BJP supporter threw a stone at the people waving the flag on the roof
 jisase hangaamaa hone laga
 It was felt that something untoward would happen when the police handled the situation with great urgency
 or koi badi ghatana hone se batch gai
 The road show also ended late in the evening and the police administration breathed a sigh of relief
 tippaniyan But this relief was only for a few hours because the next morning was the pm's scheduled road show
 jo pandeypur chauraahey se nikalakar 5 kilometre kaa rasta taykar viapeeth ke maudaan main sabha par khatm hona tha
 Once again the police force gathered with the same preparation
 ye kaarykram bhi police ke liye kaam chunauteepurn nahin tha kyonki ek to banaras kii ghani basti or sankare raste par piem kaa khule main janaa or duusari baari hujum jise puri tarah check nahin kiya ja saktaa
 However, this program also went well
 tisare din phir piem kaa gadwaghat ashram or laal bahadur shatri ke ghar sadak maarg se janaa ek chunauti ban gaya
 The administration, which had not been able to rest for three days, once again felt ready and found itself on this difficult challenge with mutual coordination
 or jab piem apni aakhri sabha rohaniya vidhansabha main karke chale gayi tab jaakar kahin banaras kaa prasashan raahat kii saans le paaya 
 Police and Para Force personnel were engaged in this three-day exercise, but the District Collector and SSP, who was responsible for the whole program, got blisters in the foot of SSP Nitin Tiwari, a 50-kilometer road walk of Benares in these three days
 And the same situation happened with DM
 par inhen kushi is baat kii he ki itane bade ran samar ko sakushal sampann kara liya
 And if we talk about Banaras, Banaras had never seen such a big battle in the election till date because the election was going on in the whole of Uttar Pradesh, but the real battleground became the home of Banaras

 Significantly, Banaras is a city of BJP mood
 yahaan shahar kii teen seat par bhaajapa kaa kabja he
 In which 2 seat cantt and southern has been occupied for decades
 par is baar tikat kaa bantwaaraa aisa hua ki logon main jabardast asantosh paidaa ho gaya

 And if we talk about Banaras, Banaras had never seen such a big battle in the election till date because the election was going on in the whole of Uttar Pradesh, but the real battleground became the home of Banaras
 or aisa isliye hua kyonki purvanchal main hawa banaras se hokar hi guzarati he or sabhi rajanithik partiyaan is hawa ko apane taraf karne liye banaras main itani takat jhonki kii banaras kaa prasasham halkaan ho gaya
 Their program was earlier at 12 o'clock and that of CM at 1 o'clock
 aise main root ek hone par aapas main takaraahat lajimi thi
 Therefore, the administration requested the pm's program and got it done at 9 o'clock and the cm's at 2 o'clock
 is prayaas ke baad prasashan ne thodi raahat kii saans lee
 But when the PM came, he set out for a 5-kilometer path to the temple in an open jeep from Lanka Gate of BHU
 piem ke kaarykram kii badi-badi soochna akhbaaron main istehaar de kar chhapi gai thi lihaaja bheed unke swaagat main jute gai
 The people of BJP had also made preparations in advance
 jagah-jagah phulon kii tokari pahunchaai gai thim
 Which was to rain on PM
 piem kaaravaan to aage badha par ye anaupchaarik road sho main tabdeel ho gaya kyonki ek to piem khuli kar main chale or duusare baari bheed kii vajah se chaal dhimi ho gai
 Which took hours to reach the temple
 pradhanmantri modi 1 baje ke aasapaas vishwanath mandir hi pahunche vahaan se puja karke kalbhairav jane main 2 se zyaada bajane laga
 Now the road show of CM Akhilesh and Rahul Gandhi has started from the court
 aise main prashasan ke paseene chhootane lage
 For the procession on both sides, the administration had deployed the force
 puure road sho ke raste ko 12 sector main baantkar prashasan ne 13 espi, 12 eespi, 45 sio ke saath police bal kaa saamanjasy dm oe esaspi lagaataar banaae hue the
 Meanwhile, the administration had also made a double arrangement
 alag root bhi banaaya tha ki koi baat hone par viipi ko duusare raste se nikaala ja sake
 However, the big thing between these arrangements was that before the cm's road show came in the way of PM
 piem ke program ko sakushal sampann karakar vidaa kar dene kii thi
 Finally, around 3 pm, the PM Ja program was over, by then the caravan of CM had completed a quarter of the distance
 lekin ab prasashan aadhi ladaai jeet chukaa tha
 But the difficulty was not over yet
 or ek badi chunauti us samay saamne aa gai jab siem or rahul kaa kafila chaukaghat pani ke tank ke paas pahunchaa tab ek bijepi samarthak ke chat par jhanda laharaa rahe logon par kahin se kisi ne pathar phenk diya
 Which caused a ruckus
 laga ki koi anhoni ho jaaegi tabhi police ne sthiti ko badi mustaidi se sambhaal liya
 And a big incident survived
 der shaam ye road sho bhi khatm hua or police prasashan ne raahat kii saans lee
 The comments lekin ye raahat chand ghanton kii hi thi kyonki agali subah to piem kaa tay road sho tha
 After leaving the Pandepur intersection, a 5-km route was to end at the meeting in Vidyapeeth's Maudan
 ek baar phir usee taiyaari ke saath police bal juta
 This program was also not a challenging task for the police, because one of the densely populated and narrow streets of Benares, the pm's going out in the open and the other heavy hoosom which cannot be fully checked
 haalanki ye kaarykram bhi thik se nikal gaya
 On the third day, it became a challenge for PM to go by road to Gadwaghat Ashram and Lal Bahadur Shatri's house
 teen din se thik based aaraam na kar paane vaala prasashan phir ek baar mustaidi se laga or aapasi talmail se is kathin chunauti par bhi par paaya
 And when the PM went to hold his last meeting in Rohania Vidhan Sabha, then the administration of Benaras could breathe a sigh of relief
 is teen din kii kavayad main police or para force ke jawan to lage hi rahe par jile ke jiladhikari or esaspi jis par puure kaarykram kaa daaromadar tha wo in teen dinon main banaras kii 50 kilometre sadake paidal naapi esaspi nitin tiwari ke pairon main chhaale pad gaye or yahi haal dm kaa bhi hua
 But they are happy that such a big battle has been completed successfully
 or agar banaras kii baat kare to banaras ne bhi aaj tak kabhi chunaav main itnaa bada ran samar kabhi nahin dekha tha kyonki chunaav to puure uttar pradesh main ho rahaa tha par asal ranbhumi to banaras kii hi sarazmi bani
 And this happened because the air in Purvanchal passes through Benaras and all political parties put so much power in Benaras to turn this wind on their side, the pressure of Banaras became light
 is bich prasashan ne dohari vyavastha bhi kar rakhi thi 
 a separate route was also made so that VIP could be removed through another route if there was any talk
 baharhaal in vyavastha ke bich badi baat ye thi ki piem ke raste main siem kaa road sho aane se pehle
 The pm's program had to be completed by leaving it safe
 aakhirkaar 3 baje ke lagbhag piem ja kaarykram khatm hua tab tak siem kaa kaaravaan ek chauthai duuri puri jaar chukaa tha
 But now the administration had won half the battle
 par abhi mushkil khatm nahin hui thi
 And a big challenge came when the convoy of CM and Rahul reached near the Chaukaghat water tank when a BJP supporter threw a stone at the people waving the flag on the roof
 jisase hangaamaa hone laga
 It was felt that something untoward would happen when the police handled the situation with great urgency
 or koi badi ghatana hone se batch gai
 The road show also ended late in the evening and the police administration breathed a sigh of relief
 tippaniyan But this relief was only for a few hours because the next morning was the pm's scheduled road show
 jo pandeypur chauraahey se nikalakar 5 kilometre kaa rasta taykar viapeeth ke maudaan main sabha par khatm hona tha
 Once again the police force gathered with the same preparation
 ye kaarykram bhi police ke liye kaam chunauteepurn nahin tha kyonki ek to banaras kii ghani basti or sankare raste par piem kaa khule main janaa or duusari baari hujum jise puri tarah check nahin kiya ja saktaa
 However, this program also went well
 tisare din phir piem kaa gadwaghat ashram or laal bahadur shatri ke ghar sadak maarg se janaa ek chunauti ban gaya

 Former Gujarat Minister of State for Home Amit Shah, arrested on July 25 in Sohrabuddin fake encounter case, has been ordered to be sent to CBI custody for two days by the Gujarat High Court
 ucch nyaayalay ne ek nichali adaalat ke faisle ko darkinar kar shah ko sibiai hiraasat main lene kii manjuuri di he
 Judge Akil Qureshi ordered Amit Shah, close to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, to be sent to CBI custody for two days
 haalanki, sibiai ne shah ke liye 10 din kii remand maangi thi
 The High Court also rejected an appeal by the defense for videography of the interrogation to take place in CBI custody
 isse pehle, sibiai kii ek vishesh adaalat ne 46 saal ke shah ko hiraasat main liye jane kii kendriya jaanch agency kii apil khaarij kar di thi
 The CBI appealed in the Gujarat High Court against the decision of the special court
 shah ke vakil mahesh jethmalani ne maang kii thi ki unke muvakkil kii do dini sibiai hiraasat ke dauraan sabhi kaarywahi kii videography karaayi jaae, lekin sibiai ke vakil ke tii es tulsi ne iskaa virodh kiya tha
 The CBI, in its petition, sought quashing of the order passed by Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate AY Dave
 dave ne shah ko remand par lene kii apil khaarij kar di thi
 Tulsi, the counsel for the investigating agency, argued that the magistrate had made a mistake in his order as cognizance of the crime had been taken in the case in which the charge sheet had been filed
 soharabuddin maamle main aarope patr daayar kiye jane ke baad shah ne apane mantri pad se istipha de diya tha
 Shah has been arrested on charges of murder, extortion and kidnapping
 sibiai remand kaa virodh kar rahe shah ke varisht vakil ram jethmalani ne daleel di ki jaanch agency ke paas unke muvakkil ko giraftaar karne ke liye koi saboot nahin he
 He alleged that Shah was arrested for creating fear among other important witnesses

 The farmers across the country started the agitation from today
 yah andolan das din chalegaa
 The farmers are on the streets again with their demands
 is andolan main kisi netaa ko shaamil nahin kiya jayega
 Abhimanyu Kohar, national spokesperson of the Rashtriya Kisanam Federation said, "we have already made it clear that political parties will not be allowed to bake their loaves in this movement
 agar koi netaa phir bhi andolan main aana chahta he to vah kisaan banakar aae na ki netaa
 “but the funny thing is that Rahul Gandhi will attend Mandsaur on the sixth day of this movement
 ve vahaan par mandsaur andolan ke dauraan maare gaye kisaanon ko shradhanjali dene jaaenge
 So whether Rahul Gandhi will go there as a farmer or as a leader of the opposition! On this, farmer leader Abhimanyu Kohar says, "this is democracy
" yahaan koi bhi, kahin bhi aa ja saktaa he
 We cannot stop Rahul Gandhi
 lekin ek baat tay he ki unki raily kaa manch alag sajega
 They will not be allowed to share the platform of the peasant movement
 ''udhar congress ke varisht netaa kamalnath lagaataar kisaan andolan se jude twit kar rahe hai
 He has raised questions about the killing of farmers shot by the government during the Mandsaur movement not being made common
 unhone kaha, chaar baar jain ayog kaa kaarykaal badhaayaa gaya

 He has rained on Twitter about the high prices of petrol and diesel
 is baar garibon ko di jaanee thim subjiyan, fal or doodh, par
 
 
 This time the peasant movement should have been different
 darasal doodh, subjiyan is baar sadakon main bahaane kii jagah garibon main baantne kaa nirdesh kisaan netritv kii taraf se jari kiya gaya tha
 But on the first day of the movement, the farmers fiercely shed milk and threw vegetables in the streets
 haalanki kuch jagahon se yah bhi khabaren ain ki kisaanon ne garibon main bhi ise baanta
 In Punjab, Faridkot, vegetables and milk were thrown on the roads and in Shahpur, Rajasthan, vegetables and milk were thrown in the streets
 rashtriya kisaan mahasang ne bataaya ki pehle din kii vajah se kisaanon kaa gussa phuta tha
 But now messages have been sent in all states that milk or vegetables should not be thrown
 hamen ummid he ab aisa nahin hoga
 Will farmers be considered this time? Farmers have four demands - 1 - Full loan waiver 2 - Cost price should be 50% added to C2 to be given a remunerative price
 3-sabji or doodh kaa emspi nirdhaaran kiya jaae
 4- Farmers' income should be ensured
 andolan kii yojana5 june:mandsaur main dhikkaar diwas6 june:pichley saal maare gaye kisaanon ko shradhanjali di jaaegi
 The Congress will reach Mandsaur on June 6 with the soil of the farmers who committed suicide

 The farmer leader said 'like the government is asking the farmers for Rs 25,000
 bond bharva rahi he ki is baar kisaan hinsa nahin karenge, jaisaa ki mandsaur main hua tha
 In the same way, we are also appealing to the government to fill up that this time they will not kill a farmer by shooting at the government

 Sharad Pawar told Sonia Gandhi that he himself would talk to Uddhav Thackeray and talk to him again after talking in detail about government formation
 sharad ne sonia ko kaha ki sarkaar gathan par koi baat hi nahin hui he
 The government in Manjadhar, the information given to Sonia by Asarshard Pawar after the imposition of President's rule in Maharashtra made the Congress high command in a tizzy
 kahaan congress shivasena ko samarthan dene ko taiyaar thi or kahaan abtak sharad pavaar or uddhav thakare ke bich baatcheet hi nahin hui thi
 Sources reveal that it did not take Sonia Gandhi any time to understand that things between Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar are still unclear

 The Congress said in a statement that there was a discussion on the formation of Maharashtra government, but nothing has been decided yet and Sonia Gandhi will talk to Sharad Pawar in future

 kendriya mantrimandal dwaara vidheyak ke masaude ko manjuuri die jane ke baad ek samvaadadaata sammelan main sarvocch nyaayalay ke varisht vakil prashanth bhushan ne kaha, yah ek sarkari lokapal hoga
 This is a cruel joke with the people of the country

 The Union Cabinet has approved the draft of a Lokpal Bill but has kept the Prime Minister and the judiciary out of the purview of the Bill

 Beginning his campaign in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, Congress President Sonia Gandhi accused the non-congress parties which had been in power in the state for the last 22 years, to destroy the state
 sonia ne kendriya ispaat mantri benny prasad verma ke sansadeey nirvachan kshetra gonda main party pratyaashiyon ke samarthan main yojit jansabha main sapa, bhaajapa or basapa par tikhe hamale karte hue kaha ki in sabhi dalon ne pichley 22 varshon main janata ke hiton ke liye koi kaam nahin kiya
 He did not develop the province, although he filled his pockets
 unhone kaha, ‘uttar pradesh ne desh kaa hi nahin balki kuch maamalon main duniya kaa netritv kiya he
 What has happened in Uttar Pradesh for the last 22 years
 sarkarein aati jaati hai, lekin aisa nahin hota jaisaa uttar pradesh main hua
 In the last 22 years, there has been a lot of change in the country and the world, there has been a lot of progress, but sadly, the parties that formed governments here have brought destruction in the whole of Uttar Pradesh
 ’sonia ne uttar pradesh main mayawati ke netritv vaali basapa sarkaar par sidhaa hamalaa karte hue kaha ki chunaav se mahaj ek maheene pehle apane 21 mantriyon ko hataa diya
 Did he not see corruption of these ministers for five years? congress adhyaksh ne kaha, ‘maujuuda mukhyamantri chunaav se thik pehle 21 mantriyon kaa istipha leti hai
 For five years he did not see the dishonesty of his ministers
 kya ab sarkaar paak saaf ho gayi
 This is a deceitful public
 kya yah janata ko thagne kii koshish nahin he
 Sonia said that there is no hearing of the common man in the state
 aisa isaliye he kyonki pichley 22 saalon main jin dalon ne yahaan sarkarein chalaai hai unke log tamaam tarah ke galat kaamon main shaamil rahe hai
 Sonia said, 'respect and security of the common man is in danger at every moment
 uske chaaron taraf samasyaayein khadi hai
 Far from providing facilities to the farmers, the little land they have to run their lives is also in danger
 kya jane kab koi sarkari farmaan aa jaae or us jameen par kabja ho jayega
 He also targeted BJP and SP and said, "the same has happened during the tenure of BJP and SP governments
" main samajhati hum ki sab ek hi thali ke chatte batte hai
 Sonia said that earlier BJP and BSP had decided to form government for six months
 sarkaar ke liye chah maheene se zyada kaa dhiraj kisi ke paas nahin tha
 They were forming a government for their selfishness and to fill their house
 ’sonia ne congress pratyaashiyon ko jitaane kii apil karte hue kaha, ‘agar uttar pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav ke baad congress kii sarkaar banati he to vah mahilaon, daliton, pichhadon, kisaanon samet sabhi virgon kii sarkaar hogi
 There will be a government of transparent governance and your current and new generation of government
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘mujhe vishwaas he ki aap in sab baton par jarur gaur karenge or chunaav ke din apana ek-ek vot dekar hamaare pratyaashiyon ko jitaayenge
 Sonia said, "if there is any political party in this country that has never cheated the people, it is only Congress
" usne puure samaaj ko barabari kii najar se dekha he or samaaj ke sabhi virgon kii chintaa karti he
 We have shown this by doing what we said
 ’unhone kendra main congress ke netritv vaali samprag sarkaar ke kaaryon kaa zikr karte hue kaha, ‘hamane apane ghoshnaptr main kahi gayi sabhi baaten amal main laai hai
 We gave 100 days of employment under NREGA
 sadak, swasthya, shiksha, rojgaar, bijli, pani ke liye yojanaayen chalaayin
 Right to compulsory and free education
 koi bhookha nahin rahe isaliye liye khadyann suraksha kanoon laae
 Sonia said that the UPA government at the Center gave more than one lakh crore rupees to the Uttar Pradesh government to implement all the schemes, but those plans did not materialize

 pashchim bengal ke log chunaavon main hameshaa bade josho-kharosh ke saath hissaa lete hai
 58 of the country in the 2009 election
 2 pratishat kii tulana main yahaan 81
 The turnout was 4 percent
 is baar bahut kuch daanv par laga he, aise main chunaav kaaphi rochak hone vaala he
 Actress Munmun Sen, music director Bhappi Lahiri and magician PC Sarkar Jr
 have also become quite colorful due to their being in the fray
 vaise parampara se pashchim bengal ke matadaata apni rajnatik vafadariyon ke maamle main safagoi or bebaaki ke saath ek party ko spasht bahumat dete hai
 Barring a decade from 1967 to 1977, when the Lok Sabha but the Assembly elections were held six times, a party or coalition in West Bengal came to power with a clear majority and completed its term
 aazaadee ke baad congress ne lagaataar 20 saal tak yahaan shashan kiya
 After that, after a decade of repeated changes and upheavals, the Communist Party-led Left Front, led by the Marxist Party, held power for 33 years
 2011 main vamapanthiyon kaa shashan khatm hua or mamata banerjee kii trinmul congress (tiemasi) vidhansabha chunaav main 294 main se 184 siten jeet kar satta par kabiz ho gai
 But this victory was due to the alliance with the Congress which has now been broken
 to kya pashchim bengal trinmul ke prati nishtha banaae rakhega?is loksabhaa chunaav main or nikat bhavishya main bhi khaas badlaav hota nahin najar aata
 India Today group-cicero conducted a poll of 1,706 voters in West Bengal from 1 to 5 April
 uske anusaar, tiemasi ko is baar 42 loksabhaa siton main se 26 (±2) siten milengi
 This time it is likely to get 7 seats more than in 2009
 vam morche ko 10 (±2) siten mil sakati hai, yani 2009 ke chunaav ke mukaable use 5 siton kaa nuksaan he
 Congress can win 5 (± 1) seats and BJP can open account from 1 (± 1) seats
 vamapanthiyon ke haath se phisaltin or tiemasi kii ore khisakati siten matadaataaon kii nishtha kaa pramaan lag sakati hai lekin ve voton kii hissedari ke bade badlaav ko chipa jaati hai
 tmc's popularity has increased in rural and urban areas of the state
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jahaan party ko 31
 2 percent votes were received, this time the figure is likely to reach 35 percent
 lekin 2011 ke vidhansabha chunaav main mili 38
 This is less than the 9 percent vote
 trinmul ne vidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaav congress ke saath chunavi qaraar kar ladaa tha
 In 2009, Congress contested only 14 seats, but this time it is fighting alone in all 42 seats and its vote percentage is also 3
 6 fisadi se 17 fisadi ho saktaa he
 The rising vote percentage of Trinamool and Congress is a symbol of their growing mass base in 42 constituencies, the reason for the Left Front's popularity falling from 23 to 20 percent
 vam morche kii lokapriyata shahari kshetron, khaskar oonchi jati or un bujurg logon main teji se ghati he, jinhone vamapanthiyon kaa lanbaa shashan dekha he
 The Left Front received an average of 49 per cent of the votes in the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections held between 1980 and 2006
 2004 or 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main isaki lokapriyata 51 fisadi se ghatakar 43 rah gai or 2011 ke vidhansabha chunaav main yah 40 pratishat par aa simati
 If its popularity continues to decline at a rapid pace and the Left Front's shareholding remains at 23 per cent, then it may have the same fate as the Congress in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in the mid-1980s and early 1990s
 lagaataar khote gaye janaadhar ko phir hasil karnaa kisi bhi party ke liye kaaphi kathin hota he
 According to the India today-cicero referendum, the BJP could benefit greatly in this Lok Sabha election
 party ke voton kii hissedari main 2009 ke 6 pratishat kii tulana main teen guna se zyada ijapha ho saktaa he or 19 pratishat voton kii badaulat use ek yaa ek se zyada siten mil sakati hai
 One out of three voters in the state considered Narendra Modi as the prime ministerial candidate, the figure of Rahul who was eligible for the post of prime minister was 19 percent and Mamata Banerjee's 24 percent
 vaise bijepi kaa pashchim bengal se purana rishta rahaa he
 Dr
 shyama prasad mukherjee ne party kii pitru sanstha bhartiya jansangh kii sthapana 21 aktubar, 1951 ko kii thi
 He was also its first president

 Nirmal Chandra Chatterjee, the father of noted lawyer and speaker of Lok Sabha Somnath Chatterjee, contested the first Lok Sabha election from Hooghly on the ticket of Hindu Mahasabha

 chatarji ke naam se behatar jane jane vaale chatarji vamapanthiyon ke hamdard ban gaye or unke sahyog se nirdaleey ummidavaar ke rup main loksabhaa chunaav jite
 BJP has been contesting elections in West Bengal since the first general election in 1951
 1977 or 1980 ke pashchim bengal ke chunaav record main iskaa kahin vajood nahin he, kyonki tab isane janata party gathbandhan ke sadsy ke rup main chunaav ladaa tha
 But till 1989 it did not field more than 10 candidates
 or 1951 main 2 siton ke alaava kabhi koi seat nahin jiti
 But it fielded candidates for 19 seats in 1989 and 42 seats in the 1991 and 1996 Lok Sabha elections thereafter
 pashchim bengal main iskaa rajnatik vanvaas khatm hua jab 1998 main isane trinmul ke saath samjhauta kiya or kolkata ke paas kii vamapanthiyon kaa majboot garh samajhi jane vaali damdam seat hathiyaa lee
 Not only did it retain the Dum Dum seat in 1999, the seat of Krishnanagar also came into its fold
 2004 main ise koi seat nahin mili, iske baad trinmul se iskaa qaraar bhi tut gaya
 For a long time in West Bengal politics, there was a fight between Opposition vs
 Left Front government
 ab jab trinmul ne vam morche ko patkhni dekar kursi par pakad majboot kar lee he to vipaksh ke liye ladaai congress or bijepi ke bich ho sakati he
 According to the India Today group-cicero opinion poll, bjp's vote share may be higher than the Congress
 shahari kshetra khaskar oonchi jati or ucch shikshit matadaataaon main isaki lokapriyata bad rahi he
 The bjp's election campaign focuses on local problems — illegal immigrants and unemployment
 modi lahar bhi asar daal rahi he, khaskar antarrashtriya seemaa se sate nirvachan kshetron or un siton par jahaan hindu sharnaarthi baari sankhya main rah rahe hai
 Like other states, the voters of West Bengal also have different voting scales in the assembly and Lok Sabha elections
 vidhansabha chunaav kii tulana main loksabhaa chunaav main rashtriya dalon ko zyada vot milte hai
 India Today group-cicero opinion poll shows that Mamata Banerjee is far ahead of other leaders for the post of Chief Minister
 yahi sthiti rahi to vidhansabha chunaav main 'mamata lahar’ kaayam rahegi
 But in the results of the Lok Sabha elections on May 16, the support of the Trinamool government may not be outlined in such depth

 Let me tell you that Jyotiraditya Scindia had said on Sunday that there was no negotiation with the SP-BSP from the Congress about joining the coalition before the election, it was unfortunate
 iske jo bhi kaaran rahe hon, lekin iskaa yah matlab nahin he ki bhavishya main bhi gathbandhan nahin ho saktaa he

 Actor Boman Irani says that many people may have thought that Veeru Saastrabuddhi of the film '3 Idiot' speaks like the famous lyricist Javed Akhtar but the character was not inspired by him
 bharat ke antarrashtriya film mahotsav main boman ne kaha, ‘har koi sochataa he ki meraa kirdaar javed akhtar ke bolne ke styl se prerit tha lekin yah sach nahin he
 'virus' Professor of 3 Idiot was running an audience class on the development of comedy in Hindi cinema at the ongoing festival
 is kirdaar ke liye filmphere or star screen award jeetne vaale adaakaar ne bataaya, ‘ek award samaaroh main main vashroom main javed akhtar se mila
 He asked if i copied him in the film, so i said no
 ’ boman ne kaha ki vastav main unhen bachapan se bolne kii samasya rahi he or kirdaar unke bolne kii aadat kii hi nakal karata he 
 The challenge of India's Rohan Bopanna and his Pakistani partner ehsam-ul-haq Qureshi has ended in the ATP Rogers Cup tournament
 'indo-paak express' ke naam se mashhoor bopanna or kuraishi kii jodi kaa shuukravaar ko purushon kii yugal spardhaa ke quarter final main saamana vishwa ke sheersh variyata praapt america ke bob or mike bryan kii jodi se hona tha
 Shortly after the quarter-final match, Bopanna complained of a left ankle strain and retired from the court after being hurt
 bopanna jab ritred hart hue us samay pehle set kaa score 3-3 tha
 Thus the Bryan brothers entered the semi-finals
 ullekhneey he ki paanchavin variyata praapt bopanna or kuraishi kii jodi ko pehle daur main bai mili thi
 The pair of Bopanna and Qureshi defeated quarter-finalists Paul Henley of Australia and Bruno Soares of Brazil 6-4, 7-6 (6) to advance to the quarter-finals
 kol drop yani baat karte-karte hi kol cat jane kii samasya badhati ja rahi he
 Expressing serious concern over this, the government has ordered a special audit of mobile networks
 iske alaava bhartiya doorsanchaar niamak praadhikaran (tri) ko mobile operataron kii seva gunvattta ke aadhaar par protsaahit athwa hatotsahit karne kii ek pranali banane ko kaha gaya he
 Using stringent words for telecom operators, telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said that he has been given sufficient amount of spectrum
 network kaa viksit karne kaa kaam va jimmedaari unki he
 However, Prasad agreed that there is a shortage of sites to install mobile towers due to radiation and other concerns, affecting the service quality of operators
 operator kai baar kol drops ke liye isko ek vajah bataa chuke hai
 The minister said that the radiation regulations implemented in India are ten times stringent by international norms
 yah puche jane par ki kya kol drop ke liye operataron par kisi tarah kaa jurmaana lagaaya jayega, prasad ne kaha, hamane tri ko protsaahit va hatotsahit ke liye dhaancha banane kaa aagrah bheja he
 Special audit will solve the problem of call drop
 TRAI has been empowered to make quality standards of services and ensure their compliance
 unhone kaha, maine vibhaag ko sevaaon kii gunvattta ke mandandon kaa vishesh audit karne kaa nirdesh diya he, jo network ke pradarshan par kendrit hoga
 This work will be done by the Department's Telecommunications Enforcement, Resource and Monitoring Cell (term)
 gauratlab he ki is audit se samasya ko samajhane, mandandon kii prakruti ko jaanane main madad milegi
 Also, it will also suggest how the situation can be improved
 pehle charan main doorsanchaar vibhaag dwaara audit sabhi mahanagaron va rajyon kii rajdhani main kiya jayega
 Is radiation from mobile towers dangerous? Reviewing the issue, the Telecom Minister said that the telecom network has become congested due to increase in data traffic in cities and increasing number of smart phones
 vibhinn nishkarshon va vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke nishkarsh kaa hawala dete hue prasad ne kaha, kol drop kaa mudda va beaties (mobile toweron) ko hataane kaa abhiyaan saath-saath nahin chal sakate
 If anyone gives any strong evidence about the adverse effects of radiation, i am willing to look at it
 mudda yah nahin he ki radiation he yaa nahin, balki mudda he ki yah khatarnaak he yaa nahin
 What happened in the country, the world, the metropolis, sports, economic and Bollywood

 63 varshiya gurbaksh singh bains 28 sitambar, 2010 kii subah patiala police ke ees hari singh ke phone ko yaad karte hue kehete hai, ''ek pal main, hamaari duniya ujaad gai
 Police said their 20-year-old son Gagandeep Singh died in a car accident at Rajpura on the chandigarh-patiala highway
 vah patiala kii thapar uniwarsity main emb kaa chaatr tha
 Hari Singh told Bains that his car collided with a standing truck and his son and another student Gaurav Verma died on the spot
 patiala ke tatkaaleen up-diviginal magistrate (esadm) gurmeet singh ke putr joravar singh or jaskaran singh jinda batch gaye
 They were eating food at a famous dhaba on the highway
 is maamle ko durghatana ke rup main darj kar kinare laga diya jaataa kyonki punjab kii sadaken dhani yuvaaon kii badi chamchamati motor kaaron main bhayanak maut se aparichit nahin hai
 It took two years to unravel the truth, the unhappy father's relentless pursuit of justice and the monitoring and intervention of the haryana-punjab High Court
 baharhaal, kabhi na bharne vaale nuksaan ke bajwood bains kaa maananaa he ki isamen bahut kuch tha
 Gagandeep had left his house in Mohali near Chandigarh a day before the accident and reported to his parents like an obedient child reaching the hostel
 bains kehete hai, ''vah jimmedaar tha
 i couldn't believe that Gagan would come out so late at night
 vah is tarah kaa nahin tha
 "bains was first suspected when he was not allowed to see the body of his son
" ve kehete hai, ''unhone (pulicekarmiyon) kaha ki unke dil ko sadma pahonchega
 Later ASI Kuldeep Singh, who conducted the investigation, insisted on Bains to sign a pre-prepared statement in which the death of the child is considered as an accident
 unhone kaha, ''main tab bhi unhen andeh kaa laabh dena chahta tha kyonki mujhe aisa koi najar hi nahin aa rahaa tha jo mere bete ko maarna chahta ho
 According to Bains, a month later he began to see discrepancies in the Patiala police accident story
 unhen pataa chalaa ki batch jane vaale do yuvak joravar or jaskaran kathith car durghatana ke samay us gaadi main nahin the
 Telephone records were stating that Zorawar and Gaurav, another dying young man, were 16 km away from each other at the time of the 'accident'
 durghatana sthal kii tasviir main gagan kii laash ko durghatnagrast gaadi ke neeche asambhav kone (sthaan) par dikhaaya gaya tha
 Bains asks, "how could he get under the car when he was in the seat next to the driver
" ''tasviir se yah bhi pataa chal rahaa tha ki khadey trek ko koi nuksaan nahin pahunchaa he haalanki police kaa daawa tha ki esayuvi kaaphi raftaar main usase sidhe takaraa gai thi
 After launching a private investigation, Bains recorded Jaskaran and Zorawar's statement about the accident in a CCTV camera
 unhone kaha, ''un logon ne jo kaha usamen visangatiyaan thim
 For example, the two had separately named the dhaba where they had gone before the 'car accident'
 police ke bayaan ke vipareet unhone paaya ki batch jane vaale donon vyakti joravar or jaskaran ko bina kisi gambhir ilaaj ke chandigarh ke sarkari superspeshility aspataal se chuttee de di gai thi
 Jaskaran was later treated at Cosmo Hospital, a private hospital in Mohali
 gagan ke fasebuk account se bains ko dhakka laga
 This led him to discover Joravar's chat with his friends
 unka kahana he ki 30 agast se 17 sitambar, 2010 ke bich is soshal network par darj baton se pataa chalata he ki ''mere bete ko maarane kii sajeesh kii ja rahi thi
 According to him, the clue to it came from an entry that was posted after the 'crash'
 usamen joravar is baat kii pushti karata dikhataa he ki maut durghatana ke kaaran nahin hui thi, ''saare bhaaiyon kii madad se yah lakshya puraa hua tha
 Now SDM Gurmeet Singh alleges that Bains is deliberately making a case against his son
 gurmeet singh ne joravar ke fasebuk wal par daali gai baton kaa print out dikhaate hue kaha,''ve fasebuk ke unheen prishthon ko dikhaa rahe hai jisase hatya kii unki kahani ko madad milti he
 "they also show 'joyful' pictures of the children and claim that they were 'good friends' among themselves
" bains kaa kahana he ki fasebuk par prakat kiya gaya dukh ''sirf andeh ko khatm karne kii koshish thi
 i believe my son is killed by his friends
 ''bains ne punjab police ke aalaa adhikariyon tak pahunchane kii kai baar koshish kii taaki unke bete ke maamle kii jaanch hatya ke taur par kii jaae
 At that time he was fighting the battle alone
 unhone kaha, ''yahaan tak ki gaurav ke parivaar vaale bhi us cese ko jari rakhane ke liye taiyaar nahin the
 '' Merchant of Delhi S
 ke
 Verma was recuperating after a heart attack and said he was unable to support Bains
 gurmeet is aarope kaa khandan karte hai ki unhone kisi bhi samay jaanch ko prabhavit karne kii koshish kii
 They say, "how can a single SDM like me affect the top police officers?" They insist that Bains is 'plotting' to ruin his family
 is maamle main chah jaanch ho chuki hai or ek ko chhodkar baaki sabakaa kahana he ki yah ''sidhaa-saadhaa accident kaa maamla he
 After all, why is he adamant on the story of his son's murder? Pratap Singh was ordered to start the investigation
 unki report 27 disambar, 2011 ko pesh kii gai, jisamen unhone kaha ki patiala police ne 'durghatana' kii managasaint exiar taiyaar kii thi
 He recommended its 're-investigation' as a case of murder by 'interrogating people involved in it' through an 'independent and impartial agency'
 unke anusaar, khadey trek ke khalasi samet mukhya gavaahon ke bayaan ko nazarandaaj kar diya gaya tha
 He claimed to have seen two men dragged from the car and hit the 'spot'
 police adhikariyon ne india today se kaha ki khadey trek ke driver or khalasi ke khilaaf ipisi 297, 304 e, 337 r 427 ke tahat darj kii gai exiar avaidh he
 How can a driver of a parked vehicle be charged for driving at a "high speed and carelessness"? He can be accused of parking as much as possible illegally
 '' unhone yah bhi kaha ki ''agar yah durghatana thi tab bhi joravar singh ko pakadaa janaa chahie kyonki ford gaadi vahi chalaa rahaa tha
 However, Anil Kaushik, the then DGP, ignored Pratap's report and ordered a fresh investigation by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) which also included the SSP of Patiala
 unhone shuru main jaanch kii nigaraanee kii thi
 Though the Home Secretary Bains later dissolved it as 'illegal', the SIT submitted its report while continuing its investigation
 gurbaksh bains ne kaha ki report ''puri tarah se gumraah karne vaali he jisamen gaganadip or gaurav kii maut ko haadasa qaraar dene kii koshish kii gai he
 Home Secretary Bains said he was "shocked" to learn that the dissolved SIT not only continued its investigation without legal authority but that its report reached the High Court, where an independent petition by Gurbaksh Bains was being heard
 bains ko lagata he ki unke bete kii 'hatya' kii jaanch ko baadhit karne ke liye 'paise kaa len-dein kiya gaya
 "he said that by making an excuse for the delay," Zoraver went to Canada
 '' gurmeet kaa kahana he ki unka betaa canada kii waterlu uniwarsity main netwarking kaa course kar rahaa he
 Finally, on 23 July 2012, the Punjab and Haryana High Court asked DIG Pratap to submit its general report
 unase khaas taur se kaha gaya ki isaki dohari hatya ke maamle ke taur par jaanch kii jaae
 But Bains's examination was not over yet
 diiji pratap ko ek baar phir jaanch roak dene ke liye kaha gaya
 Confirming this, Home Secretary Bains said that it was due to Gurmeet's objections in the name of Pratap that he may be in favor
 grih sachiv ne kaha, ''maine dijipi ko maamle ko kisi duusare adhikari ko saunpane ko kaha he
 Gurmeet says that many police officers, including DGP Sumedh Singh, disagree with the theory of murder
 unhone kaha ki ve ''sibiai jaanch ke liye bhi taiyaar hai lekin aise adhikari se jaanch nahin karvaa sakate jo pehle se hi mere bete ko hatyara maanata he
 Bains is not ready to give up
 unhone kaha, ''main kaise chhod saktaa hum? maine apane haath se apane bachche kaa dah-sanskaar kiya he, mere jivan kaa har pal uske liye nyaay maangane ke liye samarpit he
 64-year-old S
 to his persistence
 ke
 a colleague is found in the form of Verma, whose son Gaurav also died with Gagan
 unka kahana he ki ve bhi ladaai main shaamil honge
 He said, "me" Gurmeet misled
 usne kaha ki uskaa betaa joravar is durghatana ke kaaran apni ankhon kii roshni kho rahaa he
 i hear now that he is in Canada
 ''parivaar ke sabase chote sadsy kii asamyik maut ne bains ke ghar par bura prabhaav daalaa he
 Surjeet Kaur hardly speaks
 bete kii maut ke baad unako yaad nahin he ki kabhi unako chaiyn se neend ai ho
 He said, "god did not want to kill Gagandeep
 kisi duusare ne mere bete ko maaraa he
 They have to suffer what they have done
 '' gagan se 12 saal bade unke bete mandeep apane bhai kii maut ke baad se avsaadagrast ho gaye hai
 He said, "he was like my son
" kaash! beetaa do saal daraavna sapana hota
 Hopefully! Gagan would return and come home
 ''gurbaksh bains ke mutabik, ''ve jaanate hai ki sachaai par se paradaa hatane se unka betaa waapas nahin aa jayega lekin sachaai kaa pataa lagaaya janaa chahie or use bataaya janaa chahie
