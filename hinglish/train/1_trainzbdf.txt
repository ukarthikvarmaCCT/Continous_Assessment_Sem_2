 duniya kii sabase badi telecom companiyon main se ek Vodafone ne aaj swadeshi telecom company idia ke saath apane vilay kaa aadhikarik elaan kar diya he
 Now you will have many questions in your mind
 jaise agar aapke paas vodaphone kaa sim he to kya hoga yaa phir idia kaa sim he to kya hoga? kya in donon ko milakar koi nai company aa rahi he? kya tarriff or saste honge? internet sasta milegaa?aise hi sawaalon kaa jawaab yahaan aasaan or saral shabdon main jaan lijie
 Who will be the chairman? After the merger of these two companies, its chairman will be Kumar Mangalam Birla who is the head of Aditya Birla Group
 jabaki company kaa siefo vodaphone kii taraf se rakhaa jayega
 Apart from this, both companies will appoint ceos
 donon companiyon ne marjar ke baad koi nai company aegi?vodaphone ke siio vittorio ne kaha he ki donon companiyaan majboot hai, isliye vilay ke baad bhi alag alag brands se chalati rahengi
 That is, these two will not form a new company together, but will run in the name of Vodafone and Idea
 kya aaj se hi do companiyon ek ho gai hai?nahin, kyonki abhi aadhikarik elaan hua he lekin prakriya puri nahin hui he
 The deal has been cleared by Idea's board, but many approvals are yet to be received
 inamen rigerv bank of india, market regaulator securities and eksgenj board or forin investment promoshan board shaamil hai
 The process will be completed by 2018, after which these two companies will unite
 kiske kitne honge shares?vilay hone ke baad company ke shares main 45
 1 percent will be with Vodafone while 26 percent will be with Idea
 iske alaava baaki shareholders kaa hoga
 Will this company become number-1? After the merger, this company will have 400 million customers in this India and the market share will be 35%
 yani airtel philhal number-1 telecom company he, lekin vilay ke baad airtel duusare number par chali jaaegi
 This company will have the most mobile users, as well as in terms of revenue, it will become number-1, beating Bharti Airtel and Jio
 kamai main bhi hogi number-1?donon companiyaan kaa salanaa revenue 80 hajaar karod rupee kaa hoga
 That is, in the case of revenue, this company will have a market share of 41%, while in the case of users, its share will be 35%
 kya airtel or jeeyo ko hoga nuksaan?reliance jeeyo bharat main teji se paanv pasaar rahi he, isliye duusari kapaniyon par dabaav badhanaa laazmi he
 The merger will not hurt Airtel and Jio significantly, as Airtel has already bought Telenor and the company is buying spectrum from Teekona Digital Network to improve its 4G network
 is deal kii vailu 1500 se 1700 karod rupee hone kii ummid he
 Reliance Jio will try to stop its customers not only from mobile service but also from many other services
 tarriff war ho sakate hai tejais marjar se yugers ko aane vaale dinon main nae plan or packs mil sakate hai
 Because earlier Airtel was launching new plans to compete with Jio, but now after this, idea-voda with Airtel will also be in the market with new plans and packs

 According to Rajkumar Hirani, i
e
 Bollywood director Raju Hirani, the same happened to him, only then actor R
 madhavan ne 'munnabhai embibies' main kaam karne se manaa kar diya tha, or ab raju hiraani isi vajah se unke shukraguzaar hai unke
 Actually, Raju Hirani wanted to make 'munnabhai MBBS' as a TV serial, and since Madhavan was a very famous TV actor in those days, Raju went to him after writing the story
 
 
 lekin madhavan ne yah tivi serial karne se manaa kar diya
 
 
 It was then decided to make it as a film and Sanjay Dutt was made 'munnabhai' on the big screen, and the film was released in December 2003, 12 years from today
 
 
 aaj 'munnabhai embibies' ko clasik film kaa darja hasil he, or shaayad yahi vajah he ki raju hiraani ab aar madhavan kaa shukriya adaa kar rahe hai, kyonki unke manaa karne ke baad hi raju ne is kahani par film banane kaa faisla kiya tha
 The comments vaise, aar madhavan kii film 'saalaa khadoos' ko raju hiraani distribut kar rahe hai, so, uske pramotional event par aae raju ne puraani baton ko yaad kiya or kaha, "shukr he, madhavan ne 'munnabhai' karne se manaa kar diya tha
 
 
 Today 'munnabhai' has a different status, and four stories of that series have been written
 
 
 philhal main sanjay dutt kii byopic bana rahaa hum, or uske baad 'munnabhai 3' banaaungaa
 
 
 " gauratlab he ki 'munnabhai embibies' kii kamyaabi se utsahit hokar nirmaataa vidu vinod chopra or nirdeshak raju hiraani kii jodi ne varsh 2006 main film kaa sikwel 'lage raho munnabhai' banaai thi, or vah bhi khaasi kaamyaab rahi thi
 
 
 Arshad Warsi, Boman Irani and Jimmy Shergill were among the lead actors in the first film, while Gracy Singh was the heroine of the first film, and Vidya Balan in the second film
 
 
 darasal, raju hiraani 'munnabhai embibies' ko ek tivi serial ke rup main bananaa chaahate the, or chunki un dinon madhavan kaaphi mashhoor tivi abhinayta the, so, raju kahani likhane ke baad unheen ke paas gaye the
 
 
 But Madhavan refused to do this TV serial
 
 
 uske baad use film ke rup main banane kaa nirnay liya gaya or bade parde par sanjay dutt ko banaaya gaya 'munnabhai', or film release hui disambar, 2003 main, yani aaj se 12 saal pehle
 
 
 Today 'munnabhai MBBS' enjoys the status of a classic film, and this is perhaps the reason why Raju Hirani is now thanking R
 Madhavan, because only after his refusal did Raju decide to make a film on this story
 tippaniyan By the way, Raju Hirani is distributing r Madhavan's film 'sala Khadus', so Raju, who came to his promotional event, recalled the old things and said, "thankfully, Madhavan refused to do 'munnabhai' 
 
 
 aaj 'munnabhai' ko ek alag mukaam hasil he, or us series kii chaar kahaniyaan likhi ja chuki hai
 
 
 Right now i am making a biopic by Sanjay Dutt, and after that i will make 'munnabhai 3'
 
 
 " Significantly, excited by the success of 'munnabhai MBBS', the pair of producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra and director Raju Hirani made the sequel to the film 'lage Raho Munnabhai' in 2006, and it was also a successful success

 to kya aap bhi apane rishte ko isi tarah nibhaa rahe hai? Bangladesh is emerging as the biggest ODI team in the cricket world
 is team ne vanade main duniya kii top tiimon ko haraakar cricket jagat ko sann kar diya he
 After a 3–0 clean sweep against Pakistan, Bangladesh first defeated India 2–1 in the three-match ODI series and then dumped South Africa 2–1 on Wednesday
 inamen se kisi ne bhi ne apni doum darje kii team nahin bheji thi or phul strength team ko hi bangla sheron se munh kii khaani padi
 a new era of cricket has arrived in Bangladesh and now all the big teams have started to fear it
 dar jaij bhi he kyonki is team ne cricket jagat ko paanch badi sikh di he
 For the first time in the World Cup 2015, this team reached the World Cup knock out, and has also confirmed its name for the 2017 Champions Trophy
 pehla mauka hoga jab bangladesh vanade team ranking main top 8 tiimon main shaamil rahete hue champions trophy kaa tikat kataaya
 1- Fearless Bangla Sher- The strongest side of Bangladesh cricket team is its fearlessness
 team jab khelti he to wo use rigelt kaa dar nahin sataata he
 The team has risen above fear of defeat
 film mairicom kaa ek dialog he 'kisi ko itnaa bhi mat daraao ki uske andar kaa dar khatm ho jaae
 'bangladeshi team has started playing something like this
 haalanki abhi videshi pich par unka asli imtehaan hona baaki he
 Bangladesh, India and South Africa had the same style of playing Bangladesh against the three teams
 2- sirf captain hi nahin puri team aakraamak-har team ke captain kaa apana alag tarika hota he
 It is believed that the offensive captain steers the team in the right direction
 sakaaratmak aakraamakata agar aage le jaati he to vahiin nakaaratmak aakraamakata aapako nasht bhi kar sakati he
 Every player of the Bangladeshi team plays aggressively
 captain mashrafe murtaja ke saath har cricketer virdohi par haaavee ho jaataa he
 On receiving the wicket, the celebration of the team is also in an aggressive manner
 apane andaaj se hi bangladeshi team virdohi team ke paseene chhudaa detii he
 3- We are together - the third lesson is that Bangladeshi cricketers have shown the world how to play together
 team main yuva or anbhavi khilaadiyon kaa parfect mixture he
 The team has four great all-rounder players
 gendbaaji team kii majbootee bani he to ballebaajon ne bhi apana kaam bakhubi nibhaayaa
 The best thing about the team is that it does not depend on one player
 mahamudullah, shaakib al hasan, nasir hossain or mashrafe murtaja olerounder hai or kisi bhi sthiti se team ko nikaalane kaa madda rakhte hai
 Mahmudullah was injured in the series against India but Taskin Ahmed did not let his lack go
 team kii bench strength bhi majboot he
 4- Saumya's 'raudra' batting - Saumya Sarkar's name is just benign but he is a very dangerous batsman
 pichley kuch samay main is ballebaaj ne bangladesh ke liye jis tarah se ballebaaji kii he wo har kisi ne dekha he
 In 16 odis, he has scored runs at an average of around 50
 kareeb 103 strike rate vaale saumy aate hi raudra rup dikhaate hai or virdohi gendbaajon ko shuru se hi dabaav main daal dete hai
 There was a time that Bangladesh had none other than Tamim Iqbal and Mushfiqur Rahim in the name of batsman
 lekin saumy ke rup main team ko ek aisa ballebaaj mil gaya he jo tabadatod ballebaaji karte hue team ko dhamaakedaar shuruyaat detaa he
 a gentle opener should take the tip of the innings opening
 5- mashrafe kaa 'magic'-mashrafe murtaja ne captaini kii nai misaal kaayam kii he
 Along with being aggressive, there is also no lack of understanding in the recital
 wo team ko front se lead karte hai
 Examples of themselves demonstrate to the team
 mashrafe mushkil samay par khud morcha sanbhaalane se kataraate nahin hai or naa hi experiment karne se peeche hatate hai
 The team needs a similar captain
 field placement se lekar batting order main badlaav ko lekar murtaja ke faisle philhal hit hote najar aa rahe hai

 The high-level central team, which visited Jammu and Kashmir on 23rd of October, has submitted its report to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh

 Chief Minister Omar Abdullah was forced to defer the decision to remove the controversial AFSPA from select areas of the state after the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) received strong and clear signals and a strong response from Congress, the ally of the coalition government in the state
 jin jilon se eexspie or ashaant kshetra kanoon (diee) 1992 hataaya janaa tha, unamem kashmir ke (badamibagh sareekhe chhavnee ilaakon ko chhodkar) srinagar or badgam tathaa jammu divijan ke jammu or samba jile hai

 Even the Prime Minister was in favor of partially removing the AFSPA as a way of building trust
 lekin sena or raksha mantralay is bare main lagaataar alag raay jataa rahaa tha
 Abdullah's unilateral declaration on October 21 about the removal of AFSPA and DAA shocked both the state Congress and the army
 jammu-kashmir congress ke adhyaksh safuddin soz ne saarvajanik rup se shikaayat kii ki mukhyamantri ko unase salaah kerani chahie thi
 Due to the details given by the Cabinet Secretary to the Prime Minister, Abdullah postponed the removal of the AFSPA
 piemo ke ek adhikari kaa kahana tha, ''aise faisle ko lagu karne ke liye sena ke alaava raksha tathaa grih mantralayon samet sabhi kii rajamandi jaruri he
 Since AFSPA is a central law, the state cannot take a unilateral decision about it
 ''kendriya dal kii report main kaha gaya ki rajya main buniyadi dhaanche ke vikaas, aarthik pragati or saamaanya vikaas kii jarurat he or use eexspie ko lekar aisi gairajaruri bahes main nahin ulajhna chahie jise philhal taala ja saktaa he

 team ne mahasoos kiya ki shashan ko nazeer kaayam kerani hogi or sabhi pariyojnaon ko nirdhaarit samay par puraa karne ke liye un par lagaataar najar rakhni hogi
 He believed that AFSPA could be debated later
 sena or raksha mantralay eexspie or diee ko hataane kaa kadaa virodh karata aa rahaa he
 His argument is based on the Manipur model, where things have worsened in seven assembly constituencies of the state capital, Imphal, after the AFSPA was lifted in 2004
 ek suraksha adhikari ne daawa kiya, ''vidrohi rajya ke duusare bhaagon main hinsak karravaaiyaan karte or uske baad un ilaakon main sharan le lete, jahaan se eexspie hataa liya gaya he
 The security establishment also believes that the achievement achieved in Jammu and Kashmir will be lost after the AFSPA is removed
 ek adhikari ne bataaya, ''sena ne chaahe jis bhi vajah se 2005 ke baad srinagar main karrwai nahin kii he
 Budgam and Ganderbal are the major routes of infiltration

 "leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley also strongly argued in favor of continuing AFSPA in Jammu and Kashmir and said that the status of removal of this law has not yet come

 Chidambaram accused the former Jayalalithaa-led government of not implementing any notable scheme and said that the DMK has made all-round development in the state
 congress ummidavaar rajasekharan ke samarthan main chunavi sabhaaon ko sambodhit karte hue chidambaram ne kaha ki jayalalita kii ‘uplabdhiyon’ main tesama (tamilnadu aavashyak seva dekhbhaal kanoon) kaa istemaal or sarkari karmchaariyon ke khilaaf aise anya apatkaaleen kadam hai, jinase dedh lakh sarkari karmchaariyon ko naukari ganvaani padi tathaa dharmik vaartalap par roak laga di gayi
 He claimed that many achievements of the DMK government on the other hand included loan waiver of Rs 7500 crore to farmers, introduction of 108 ambulance services and introduction of a life insurance scheme for the poor
 grih mantri ne kaha, ‘janata ko annadramuk ke shashan kii tulana dramuk kii sarkaron se kerani chahie or faisla karnaa chahie
 He also said that it is due to the Congress-led UPA government at the Center that the country has secured second place in economic development after China
 chidambaram ne kaha, ‘bhartiya arthvyavastha mandi main bhi sthir rahi

 wo shahar kaa pani or bijli kaa 500 dollar tex (lagbhag 35 hazaar rupee) bhi bharti hai
 There is only 1 ATM in the world's largest country, yet people have no problem, they withdraw money from fun, even Elsie maintains this city herself

 By the year 2004, only Elsie and her husband Rudy remained in this city
 lekin 2004 main pati kimout ke ab elsi akeli is shahar main rahati hai
 Elsie's now runs an inn that offers water, tea and snacks to tourists visiting Monovi

 Today i saw the film, Forced Jodi and what to tell about what is in this film
 ek film banane ke liye chahie hoti he kahani, jo is vaali main to nahin he
 Siddharth Malhotra and Parineeti Chopra starrer This film is about forced marriages in Bihar
 film main bubbly yadav (pariniti chopra) hai
 She does what came to her mind
 ekadam nidar he
 On the other side is Abhay Singh (siddharth Malhotra) who gets both married and Shradh
 abhaya dabang hai or apni dabangai jhaadte najar aate hai
 Both are childhood friends too, who fall in love when they meet in their youth
 bubbly jo do pal pehle apane boyfriend ke bevafa hone kaa dukh manaa rahi thim wo abhaya ko dekhakar unase apane pyaar kaa izhaar bhi karti hai or shaadi ke sapane bhi sajaane lagati he
 Abhay Babu forces everyone's home, but gets scared in his turn
 abhaya or bubbly kii kahani par bani ye film shuru hone ke thodi der main hi ek jagah se duusari jagah pahunch jaati he or usamen sens bananaa band ho jaataa he
 Siddharth Malhotra and Parineeti Chopra's acting on the film's story was difficult to find
 haa, bich-bich main sanjay mishra, javed jaafaree or aparshakti khurana aate hai or aapkaa acha feel karavaate hai
 The punch and jokes of the film were good though they could not survive this film
 diarector prashanth singh kya banane kii koshish kar rahe the, jabariyaa jodi ko dekhakar iskaa andaja lagaana behad mushkil he
 The theme of the film was great, if it had been properly screened, it could have done wonders
 lekin film ko dekhakar saaf he ki mekar samaj nahin paae ki is kahani ke saath nyaay kaise karen
 The simple story of the characters of Siddharth and Parineeti was so entangled that the film became untangled hands-free of someone's phone, there is no question of solving it
 film ke gane thik hai
 Overall, it is so difficult to cope with this film that even if someone asks you to watch it on the strength of the gun, you will not be able to do it
 film kaa box offis par behad kaamyaab hona kaaphi mushkil najar aa rahaa he
 Overall, it seems that Siddharth and Parineeti's account as another forced flop as a forced pair

 jile ke khera or charakapaththar thana kshetra ke lakhari gaanv sthit jangal main surakshabalon or naksaliyon ke bich subah se lekar dopaher kareeb do baje tak muthbhed chali
 On the other hand, the jawans have alleged that they did not get enough help during the encounter and they are said to be angry with this move of the administration
 jaankaree ke anusaar siarpief ke javaanon kii ore se lakhari gaanv sthit jangal main search oparation chalaaya ja rahaa tha
 During this time he was confronted by Naxalites
 iske baad donon pakshon ke bich kai ghanton tak golibari hui
 During the encounter, Hira Kumar Jha, second in command of the 7th Battalion of CRPF, was killed
 surakshabalon ne chaar naksaliyon sahit saat sandigdhon ko bhi pakadaa he
 One of them is Reena, the wife of zonal committee commander Sidhu Koda
 pakade gaye naksaliyon ke paas se rifl, bandook or police se luute gaye pistal bhi baraamad hue hai
 The security forces have alleged that they did not get enough help from the local administration during the encounter
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki search oparation ke dauraan mausam kharaab hone kii vajah se helicopter kii suvidha muhaiyaa nahin karai ja saki
 The family of HN Jha, who died in the encounter, lives in New Delhi but his ancestral home is in Dhanbad

 maharashtra par supreme court kaa faisla bhale hi mangalvaar kii subah 10:30 baje aayega
 Meanwhile, NCP leaders are making every effort to convince Ajit Pawar
 subah party ke varisht netaa chagan bhujabal ajit pavaar ko manaane aae the or ab vidhayak dal ke nae netaa jayant patil or chagan bhujabal or dilip wallseis samay ajit pavaar se milane gaye hai
 Earlier, sources were quoted as saying that the ncp-shiv Sena has agreed to run the government for two-and-a-half years to bring back Ajit Pawar
 lekin sawaal is baat kaa he jab ensipi kaa daawa he ki uske paas 53 vidhayak ko samarthan he or usne rajbhavan main vidhayakon kii jo chitthee saunpi he usamen 51 vidhayakon ke hastakshar hai
 The remaining two mlas have since moved from Delhi to Mumbai, so why is Ajit Pawar pleading with him so much? It is being told that the leaders who have gone to celebrate Ajit Pawar should also talk to Ajit Pawar on the phone with party supremo Sharad Pawar
 darasal is baat ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki ho saktaa he supreme court sadan main bahumat sabit karne ko kahe
 Such mlas who are currently claiming to be with the NCP cannot be said on whose side they will vote in the House
 shaayad ensipi netaaon ko aisa lag rahaa he ki kahin aisa na ho ajit pavaar ke prabhaav main aakar party ke vidhayak sarkaar ke paksh main vot kar den
 Same is the situation of Shiv Sena and Congress leaders
 in donon partiyon ke vidhayakon ko bhi hotalon main rakhaa gaya he
 At the same time, NCP mlas have been accommodated in three different hotels
 aapako bataa den ki maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav me bijepi ko 105, shivasena ko 56, ensipi ko 54 or congress ko 44 siten mili hai
 The BJP and Shiv Sena together crossed the 145 mark
 lekin shivasena ne 50-50 formule kii maang rakh di jiske mutabik dhai-dhai saal sarkaar chalaane kaa model tha
 Shiv Sena says that the agreement with BJP was done on this formula but BJP claims that no such agreement was reached
 isi lekar matbhed itnaa badha ki donon partiyon kii 30 saal puraani dosti tut gai
 After this, after several rounds of meetings, the congress-ncp and Shiv Sena decided to form the government under Uddhav Thackeray and on Saturday, the three parties were going to Raj Bhavan to stake claim
 lekin bijepi ne raat main hi ajit pavaar se milakar baaji palat di or subah 8 baje hi siem devendra fadanvis ne shapath le lee unke saath ajit pavaar dipti siem ban gaye
 Ajit Pawar claimed that he has the support of all NCP mlas
 lekin baad main sharad pavaar in baton ko nakaar diya
 Now the matter has reached the Supreme Court and the decision is awaiting tomorrow

 There may be differences of opinion on whether Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan should be ultra-optimistic or realistic, but there will be no doubt that there is a deep darkness in the sensitive part of foreign trade which is getting deeper every month
 bharat kaa niryaat 16 maah kii lagaataar giravat ke baad ab paanch saal ke sabase kharaab str par he
 The government's rationale of attributing the decline in world growth to the export plight is not sustainable, as the decline of Indian exports has become complex, deep and multifaceted, and the government seems to have zero policy and zero understanding
 global growth ke utaar-chadhaav kisi bhi desh ke niryaat ko prabhavit karte hai lekin bharat ke niryaat kii giravat ab dhanchaagat ho gai he
 Competitiveness of exports has been broken due to the continuous decline of the last 16 months
 niryaat main pratispardhaatmakataa kaa akalan vibhinn deshon ke bich niryaat main kami yaa giravat kii tulana ke aadhaar par hota he
 The latest report by Emwbit Capital, which compared the world export figures in the last one year, shows that India's exports have dropped at a faster pace than other countries
 2015 kii teesri timahi se 2016 kii teesri timahi ke bich china ke niryaat kii growth rate ghatakar ek fisadi rah gai jo is daur se pehle paanch fisadi par thi
 Bangladesh 10 to 3 percent, Vietnam 16 to eight percent, Korea three to five percent, South Africa four to zero percent
 inaki tulana main bharat kaa niryaat jo taaja mandi se pehle chah fisadi kii dar se bad rahaa tha, vah pichley ek saal main 19 fisadi gira he, jo duniya ke vibhinn mahadwipon main faile do darjan se adhik pramukh niryaatak deshon main sabase jabardast giravat he
 Brazil and Indonesia's exports have fallen sharply due to lower prices in the global commodity market, but India's decline is much deeper than that
 niryaat kii badahaali kii tulanaatmak tasviir par china kaaphi behatar he
 Even India's exports have dropped five and four times faster than Pakistan and Bangladesh
 aankadon ke bheetar utarane par yah bhi pataa chalata he ki bharat se menuphacchard utpaadon ke niryaat kii giravat, ubharate bazaaron kii tulana main zyada tej he
 Higher prices of transport, machinery and electronics have suffered
 pichley teen saal main dollar ke mukaable rupaya kareeb 24 fisadi tutaa he
 Generally weak domestic currency is considered ideal for export growth, however, despite being weak, Indian rupee is strong in exports against the currencies of competing countries, hence exports have dropped
 aise halaat main niryaatkon ko sarkari nitigat madad kii jarurat thi jo najar nahin ai
 The decline in competitiveness leaves exporters out of the market for a long period of time, which makes it difficult to gain a foothold in the market as demand increases
 bhartiya utpaadon kii pratispardhaatmakataa ghatane kaa asar aayaat par bhi najar aata he
 Statistics from the Ministry of Commerce show that ever since global trade started slowing down, India's imports from China have increased
 isamen menuphacchard saamaan kaa hissaa zyada he
 This means that Indian products are not able to survive in the competition of both export and domestic markets
 bharat kaa seva niryaat bhi dhalaan par he
 The latest Reserve Bank data shows that 12 in February 2015 receipts from exports of services
 55 fisadi giravat ai he

 India now lags behind Pakistan in textile exports

 However, if even a small part of this outrage takes care of exports, then on this front, there can be hope of changing the worst condition of five years

 Continuing to put psychological pressure on India's new Test captain Virat Kohli, Australian opener David Warner on Sunday said he would like to see how aggressive Kohli proves to be in the fourth and final cricket Test in Sydney
 unhone kaha, 'main use dekhnaa chahta hum ki vah pichley test kii tarah kii aakraamakata dikhaata he yaa nahin
 Kohli will take charge of the team after Mahendra Singh Dhoni's sudden retirement from Test cricket
 warner ne kaha, 'emes (dhoni) khel ke bare main kaaphi sochate hai or unhen isaki kaaphi samaj he
 They know how to dismiss the batsman

 ' unhone kaha, 'unke saamne khelnaa kaaphi chunauteepurn rahaa he kyonki aapke dimag main yah hameshaa rahata he ki pataa nahin aaj vah koun sa daav chalenge
 Talking about the aggressive atmosphere of the series, Warner said that no player should exceed the limits, but admitted that he himself had done so
 unhone kaha, 'main khud ateet main kai baar seemaa laangh chukaa hum
 Not only the Indian team, we also do it, celebrating the wicket like that
 ham sabhi ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie ki ati utsahit naa hon
 ' warner ne kaha, 'sabase acha tarika yahi he ki aap isaki taraf peeth karke wicket lekar jawaab den kyonki aise main aakhir main jeet aapaki hogi
 'he said,' i know i have to learn
 maine ateet main bhi isse siikhaa he lekin mujhe lagata he ki ham sabhi mujhase sabak le sakate hai
 He jokingly said that Mitchell Johnson is not playing the fourth Test, so he will not be able to join him in the sprint against the opposing team on the field
 warner ne kaha, 'mujhe nahin pataa ki aage main chhintakashi kaise karuunga
 He supports me michel main vah eks factor he
 The opposing batsmen get terrorized many times that they have to play Mitchell Mitchell for three or five overs which will be very tough
 ' unhone kaha, 'hamaare paas haalanki mishael stark jaise gendbaaj hai jo 150 kimi kii raftaar se gendbaaji kar sakate hai

 Hem Mishra was accused of being a courier of Naxalites

 Let us know the story of Hem Mishra
 20 agast 2013 ko kya hua tha?main magsese puraskaar praapt doctor or saamaajik kaaryakarta prakaash amte se milane maharashtra ke gatchiroli gaya tha
 He runs a folk fraternity hospital in Bhamragarh which works among the local people
 20 agast 2013 ko subah saadhe nau baje main bhallarshah utraa
 From here i had to take a bus to Bhamragarh
 (padhate hue bharat kaa maanchitr bhi dekhen) isi dauraan kuch logon ne mujhe peeche se pakad liya
 Those people were in plain clothes
 main chaunkaa, ghabaraaya bhi
 He even tried to shout but in a while he pulled me out of the railway station
 lagbhag 20 logon ne mujhe vahiin khadi ek tata suumo main mujhe dhakel diya
 Start beating inside the car
 wo kahin bhi maar rahe the, kaise bhi maar rahe the
 When he snatched my purse, he felt that he wanted to rob something
 ek ghante baad unamem se ek ne kaha, ‘tu jaananaa chahta he naa ham koun he phir usne apana idi dikhaaya
 Then i came to know that they were the people of Gadchiroli Special Branch
 'yatnaa kaa antaheen dauraiske baad unhone meri ankhon par pattee baandh di
 i told him that i am a student of JNU
 maine apni ai di dikhaai
 But they were not ready to listen
 wo mujh par dabaav banane lage ki wo jo kehete hai main chupchaap sweekaar kar luun
 He told me that you accept that you are going to meet Naxalite leaders
 agar tumne sweekaar nahin kiya to anjaam samaj lo
 The car stopped after two and a half hours
 sainik chhavnee jaisi jagah thi
 There he took me to a room
 vahaan maine ek board dekha jis par naam likhaa tha shuej haq
 i later came to know that he was the SP of Haq Saheb Gadchiroli

 is dauraan wo mujhe laat maarthe, gandi gaaliyaan dete or iske alaava unke paas unka bajirao to tha hi
 Bajirao was a wide leather belt
 jise unhone kaaphi glamraise kiya tha
 The specialty of that bandage is that it hurts a lot but it does not hurt
 isko lakdi ek handle main fiks kiya jaataa tha taaki tabadatod chalaane ke dauraan koi dikkat na ho
 That 80 hours
 
 
 
 He told me that i must accept that i was going to meet Maoist commander Narmada
 ye baat saraasar jhooth thi to sweekaar karne kaa sawaal hi nahin tha
 They kept on beating, but how would i accept this
 is dauraan mujhe encounter kii dhamkee di, enas main bhi petrol daalane kii dhamkee di
 Naxalites' dress was also worn and it was said that they will encounter it by wearing it and no one will know
 is dauraan na mere ghar main na college main kisi ko bhi pataa nahin tha main kahaan hum
 When a nap came, he would kill or add water
 saamne vaale kamare main do adivasee ladke the unako bhi lagaataar maaraa ja rahaa tha
 i could hear their screams and they could hear my voice
 assi ghante tak yah silsilaa bina ruke jari rahaa
 Three days later, the news was given to the family members, after 80 hours, on 23 August, we were put in a lockup of Ahri Tehsil of Gadchiroli
 phir hamaara medical chekup hua
 i showed my wounds to the doctor, but the medical service was just a ritual
 usee din mujhe magistrate ke aage pesh kiya gaya
 He was speaking in Marathi
 police ne magistrate ko kaha unhone mujhe ahiri ke bas stand se pakadaa jabaki unhone mujhe vahaan se do sau assi kilometre dur bhallarshah se pakadaa tha
 i pleaded with the magistrate strongly
 maine kaha police kii kahani juthi he
 It was just there that the magistrate placed a call in front of me at my house and informed the family members
 mujhe das dinon kii remand par bhej diya gaya
 i was closed on the twenty-first date but the police recorded a twenty-two date
 remand main jari rahaa bhayanak yatnaa kaa silsilaa
 
 
 The police had imposed UAPA (unlawful Act of Prevention Act) on me

 Neither i was given brush nor soap or clothes
 vahaan gandagi badboo ke bich main das dinon tak padaa rahaa
 i would go here for two to three hours, but the torture would go on

 During this time, pressure was put on me to accept the story of the police

 i was kept in police remand for a total of 27 days from 20 August

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has targeted the Narendra Modi government at the Center with the latest Swiss Bank figures

 Rahul released three figures, tweeting a video of India Today
 unhone likhaa ki 2014 main unhone (sarkaar) kaha ki main swiss bank main jamaa sara kaala dhan laaungaa or sabhi bharatiyon ke khate main 15 lakh jamaa karaaunga
 Subsequently, in 2016, it said that demonetisation would eliminate black money present in the country
 vahiin ab 2018 main wo kah rahe hai ki swiss bank main jo bharatiyon kaa paisa badha he vah sab white mani he, swiss bank main koi kaala dhan nahin he
 2014, HE said: i will bring back all the "BLACK" money in Swiss Banks & put 15 Lakhs in each Indian bank a / C
 2016, HE said: Demonetisation will cure India of "BLACK" money
 2018, HE says: 50% jump in Swiss Bank deposits by Indians, is "WHITE" money

 unhone kaha ki prachaar ke dauraan inhone 15 lakh rupye dene kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin satta main aae to ye jumala ban gaya
 It is worth noting that in the latest figures released by the Swiss bank, it is seen that in the last one year, the deposits of Indians have increased by about 50%

 -input IANS assam chunaav ke nattejey vaale din 19 may ko bijepi jashn main dubi thi, lekin party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah kii nigaah arjuna kii tarah machhlee kii aankh par tiki thi
 Jehan had Uttar Pradesh assembly elections
 or der shaam unhone faisla le liya
 Immediately, the State President Keshav Prasad Maurya was given a decree that the meeting of the National Executive would be held in Allahabad
 upi ko lekar shah kii chatapataahat kaa hi namoona he ki ve aksar apane sahyogiyon se kehete hai, ''2019 jeetna he to upi jeetna aavashyak he
 "the importance of Uttar Pradesh is associated with Shah's credibility because despite all the controversial background, UP is the biggest contributor to the bjp's top chair
 aise main bijepi agar upi kaa kila fatah nahin kar paati he to ek kushal ranneetikaar ke taur par ubhari shah kii chhavi bharbhara kar dhah jaaegi
 Probably only when in January, when Shah was discussing the coronation for the second time, on the request of bjp's UP unit to conduct the election of the organization, he said, "let my president's election first, then UP Will think about " shah ko kareeb se jaanane vaale ek ranneetikaar kehete hai, ''upi ko lekar unke dimag main ek alag khaakaa he jise ve moort rup dene se pehle shaayad hi kisi se saajha karnaa pasand karen
 "but the importance of UP is important for the modi-shah duo of BJP, it can also be gauged from the fact that the rally in Saharanpur in Mathura, UP after the completion of one year of the Modi government
 done
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii mahatvakankshi kisaan fasal beemaa yojana kii shuruyaat bareli se kii gai to ujjwala yojana kii loching ke liye purvanchal ke baliya jile ko chunaa gaya
 Allahabad was also selected for the National Executive, which has been a very backward area in terms of BJP politics
 iske peeche bijepi kii ranneeti agle teen maheene ke bheetar upi main bhagava maahaul banane kii he
 But the Bihar election has made the modi-shah duo realize that it is not easy to create an atmosphere and convert it into votes at the ground level
 lihaaja party ne khud ko mukaable main banaae rakhane or chunaav ke baad ke sameekaran ko dekhte hue kargar ranneeti par kaam tej kar diya he
 Why the party wants to compete with SP After the results of Bihar elections, an atmosphere was started in favor of BSP in UP
 lekin bijepi chaahati he ki uski ladaai sapa se hoti hui najar aae
 Shah himself is constantly talking of fighting SP against the SP by rejecting BSP from public forums
 andruni baithkon main bhi shah kehete hai ki bijepi kaa bispi se muqabla nahin he kyonki loksabhaa main usko ek bhi seat nahin mili thi
 However, he ignores the fact of Mayawati getting 20 per cent of the votes while saying so
 darasal, iske peeche ek ranneeti haih bijepi aisa maahaul bananaa chaahati he jisase logon ko lage ki bispi ladaai main nahin he taaki uskaa sidhaa phayda party ko mili
 The reason? It is often seen in UP that BSP gets the benefit of the weakening of the SP
 bijepi ke ek varisht netaa is ranneeti ke bare main kuch is tarah khulaasa karte hai, ''sapa sattarudh party he, usase muqabla hone kii sthiti main hi dhruvikaran ho saktaa he or sabase ahm baat, chunaav baad trishanku vidhansabha banane par bijepi kaa bispi se gathbandhan ho saktaa he, sapa ke saath aisa sambhav nahin
 "however, another BJP strategist believes that if the Muslim does not turn to the BSP, the party is bound to face the SP
 bijepi kii tristareey ranneetibijapi uttar pradesh ko chah jone main baantkar chunavi ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he
 But his strategy is three-tier
 purvanchal main jahaan bijepi behad kamjor sthiti main he vahaan party puri tarah se jati sameekaran ko saadh rahi he to pashchimi upi main dhruvikaran uskaa mukhya hathiyaar hoga
 The issue of development will be tried in the most backward region of UP, Bundelkhand
 isamen sabase pehle party centre kii modi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ko is tarah se prachaarit karne kii koshish karegi, maano desh main badlaav dikh rahaa he lekin upi main sapa sarkaar kii vajah se centre kii yojanaon kaa laabh janata ko nahin mil rahaa
 Apart from this, under the message of complete change, the party is working towards keeping the facts of corruption, criminalization and communalism in the last 14-15 years of SP-BSP rule
 saath hi, party dhruvikaran se jude kisi bhi mudde ko chhodie ke mood main nahin he
 Therefore, the party first raised the issue of alleged Hindu migration from Kairana and later linked it with law and order and the failure of the state government
 bijepi chaahati he ki muqabla sapa banaam bijepi ho taaki sapa kii dabang or aparaadhiyon ko prashray dene vaali uski image kaa naiysargik laabh use mili
 Therefore, the party has strongly encouraged the incident of Mathura and Kairana across the state
 avaidh kabje ko lekar party ne alag email aaidi bana di jis par party ko ab tak 1,200 se zyada shikaayatein mil chuki hai
 In these places, the BJP is strategizing the struggle of the cross and hoardings-posters have been put up in UP with the slogans of "blood-stained Mathura, Sleeping Sarkary"
 bichne lagi dhruvikaran kii bisatbijepi janata kii us nabj ko pakadaaey kii koshish kar rahi he jisamen kathith taur par sapa sarkaar ke samay sirf musalamaanon or yadavon kii sunwaayee hone kii bhaavana balwati he
 In the words of a senior BJP strategist, "BJP will not be able to show its strength unless there is direct polarization in the elections
" " lekin bijepi kaa dhruvikaran card bihar chunaav main dharashayi ho chukaa he
 Therefore, the party is also a bit uneasy about this issue
 bijepi ke ek varisht netaa yaad dilaate hai, ''ayodhya main vivaadit dhaancha giraae jane ke baad 1993 main chunaav hue the tab kalyaan singh us puure ghatnakram ke pratik the lekin us chunaav main party 221 siton se ghatakar 177 siton par aa gai thi
 "this leader believes that when the party could not win elections even at the peak of polarization, it would be a misunderstanding to dream of power with the help of polarization
 haalanki 27 june ko barabanki main avadh kshetra ke booth kaaryakartaaon ke sammelan main shah ne kairana ko hindu palaayan se joda to sapa sarkaar kii laptop yojana, naukariyon main ek hi samudaay ko tarjeeh dene kaa mudda bhi uthaaya
 He bluntly said, "if everything goes to the same community, then where will the other people go?" BJP is also waiting for the hearing in the Supreme Court on the issue regarding the Ram temple in July
 mukhyamantri ke chehron par mahabharataupi main 14 saal kaa satta kaa banavaas khatm karne kaa mansuba paale baithi bijepi kii mushkil uske khewanhaar ko lekar hi he
 No party in the party bereft of state power for so long can stand before maya-mulayam
 party kii ummid jin do puraane chehron par jaakar tikti he unamem se kalyaan singh rajyapal vaali qatari main ja chuke hai to rajnath singh kendriya grih mantri hai
 There is a lot of discussion about making Rajnath the chief ministerial candidate, but no one in the party is ready to confirm nor reject it
 haalanki is bare main antim faisla sangh or pradhanmantri modi ke str par hi hoga
 But the matter of making Rajnath as the Chief Ministerial candidate would be extremely sensitive as it could send a negative message in central politics
 agar unhen upi bheja jaataa he to modi-shaahaki jodi par varisht netaaon ko kinare karne kaa aarope chaspaan ho saktaa he kyonki ve 16 saal pehle siem rah chuke hai or bataur rashtriya adhyaksh do loksabhaa chunaavon kaa sanchaalan kar chuke hai
 But sending them will show the seriousness of the party in the state and the crisis of strong face will also end compared to maya-mulayam
 par sutron ke mutabik, rajnath ab pradesh kii raajnneeti main jane ko bilkul icchhuk nahin kyonki haarane par sara thikra unke sir phutegaa or upi ke raste bijepi kii sheersh satta par virajman modi-shah jimmedaari se batch jaaenge
 However, apart from Rajnath, Yogi Adityanath, Member of Parliament from Gorakhpur, the most favorable face in the politics of polarization of the party, is being seriously discussed in the party
 varun gandhi or maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri smriti irani, jo saamaajik sameekaran ke khaanche main feet nahin baithte, khud hi apane liye lamabandi karte dikh rahe hai
 However, about a dozen Union ministers associated with UP are mostly imported faces who are now heading UP
 aise main yah dekhnaa bhi dilachasp hoga ki pradesh kaa netritv mul upi vaala karegaa yaa phir koi bahari
 If the party does not project any face, then its biggest challenge will be to play bets on the face of Prime Minister Modi
 bihar main modi kii dhuandhar raily ke baavjood nateezon main party kaa aundhe munh girnaa unki saakh par sawaal uthaa gaya, jiske baad party ne assam main sthaneey chehre par safal daanv khelaa
 According to sources, the Prime Minister's rallies in UP will not be like Bihar
 soshal ejineering kaa guladastadhruvikaran or netritv ko lekar uhapoh main fansi bijepi ne saamaajik sameekaran or gathbandhan kaa bada guladasta banane kii disha main kadam badha diya he
 In the appointment of the state president, the party played bet on OBC leader Keshav Prasad Maurya of Purvanchal, but in the experience so far, that card has not proved to be very favorable
 party ne jis tarah obisi-dalit par jor diya, usase savarnon main jabardast naaraazgi ne party kii chintaa badha di thi
 Therefore, the party sent the Muslim face Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi to the Rajya Sabha from Jharkhand and made symbolic Brahmin face Shiv Pratap Shukla as the Rajya Sabha MP
 ab party agar siem project karti he to vah bhi savarna ho saktaa he
 The bouquet of social engineering has been prepared by Shah himself, who targeted 80 per cent of the votes of upper castes, backward and Dalits, excluding 20 per cent Muslim votes as general secretary in charge in the Lok Sabha elections
 or endie ne modi lahar main 80 main se 73 siten jiti thim
 However, this time the BJP has also micromanaged the social equation
 party 20 fisadi muslim vot ke alaava kareeb 10 fisadi yadav or 10-11 fisadi jatav voton ko chhodkar dalit-pichhadon ke baaki voton ko apane paksh main ekajute karne main jute gai he
 The BJP already has an alliance with the Apna Dal, which has a base in the Kurmi vote bank of the OBC, and now the party is in touch with about a dozen smaller parties, including Rajbhar
 inamen se zyaadaatar ko party vilay kaa prastaav de rahi he or vilay se jiskaa vot hastantaran nahin hoga uske saath gathbandhan hoga
 To make a dent in the Dalit vote bank, the party has started the Dhamma Chetna Yatra by advancing Buddhist monks who are going to Buddhist viharas and seeking votes for the BJP

 Standard SMS Charges Applicable ” The Prime Minister Narendra Modi government has set a target of housing for all by 2022
 is lakshya ko puraa karne ke liye saat varsh rah gaye hai
 This means that about 44 thousand everyday or 1 every year
 6 karod makaan banane honge
 Six major hurdles in the path of this ambitious goal can be easily identified, which the government needs to pay attention to
 It is very difficult that everyone can be roofed over their heads
 1
 Growing cities? The country's two metros Delhi and Mumbai are among the top 10 metros in the world
 sanyukt rashtrake aankade ke mutabik kolkata 2030 tak duniya ke 15 sabase bade mahanagaron main shaamil ho jayega
 According to the 2011 census, there are nine million homeless people living in cities
 iske saath hi shaharon kii jhuggiyon main 6
 5 crore people live
 sarkari aankade ke mutabik shaharon main jitne logon ko makaan chahie, unamem se 90 fisadi behdgareeb hai
 2
 shaharon kii ore palaayan or management?krishi kshetra kii kam vikaas dar ke kaaran gaanvon se shaharon kii ore bade paimaane par palaayan ho rahaa he
 There are about 67 crore people in villages, whose daily income is less than Rs 33
 2031 tak shaharon kii aabaadi 38 karod se 60 karod ho jaaegi
 In such a situation, poor management can spoil the game
 3
 Slums have a large population? According to the census today, about 17 percent or about 6 of the cities
 5 karod kii aabaadislamon menrahati he
 In such a situation, making all displaced kir houses will be crooked
 4
 Where will the land come from? To overcome the shortage of houses, about two lakh hectares of land will be needed
 is kami se nipatane ke liye kuch visheshgyon kii salaah he ki imaaraton kii oonchai badhaai jaae or iske liye floor spes index (ennesai) ke niyam saral kiye jaaen
 There have been some recent improvements in this direction in Mumbai
 desh ke adhiktar shahar kaaphi saghan hai, jahaan prati varg kilometre kshetra main das hajaar se bhi adhik log rahete hai
 But the question is, is the government ready for this? 5
 maanak par kaise khara utrenge?sabhi ke liye awaas yojana ke andar or bhi chijen shaamil hongi jaise, nai ikaiyaan, credit-linkd sabsidi, labhaarthiyon dwaara kiya jane vaala nirmaan or jhuggiyon main sthit gharon kapunarvikas
 Maintaining quality in the race to build a house will be a challenge
 ek aankade ke mutabik abhi desh main har tisare makaan kii gunvattta kharaab he
 In such a situation, will the government itself be able to meet all the standards when it has to complete this work in seven years
 6
 Dealing with the Network of Rules [the biggest obstacle to Prime Minister Modi's housing plan will be to deal with the mess of government regulations, including the construction approval process, which the World Bank has called the worst in the world

 main coach ke bare main tippanee nahin karuunga, kyonki mahasang ko keval yahi lagata he ki ve videshi coach ke bina kuch nahin kar sakate
 Former Indian player and Dhyanchand awardee Shabbir Ali said that there should be no excuse for this poor result
 unhone kaha, puri team ko is hataashajanak pradarshan ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya janaa chahie
 It was really surprising how they lost to Afghanistan, while they did well against Maldives in the semi-finals
 purv bhartiya coach said naimuddin ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki vim ko turant istipha de dena chahie
 At this time, Indian coaches are needed and they should be given the same facilities that are given to a foreign coach
 subhash bhaumik ne bhi kovermans kii chhetri ko baahar rakhane kii ranneeti kii aalochana kii
 He said, i was surprised by the coach's decision to keep Chhetri out
 main coach ke bare main tippanee nahin karuunga, kyonki mahasang ko keval yahi lagata he ki ve videshi coach ke bina kuch nahin kar sakate
 Subhash Bhowmick also criticized the coverman's strategy of keeping Chhetri out
 unhone kaha, main coach ke chhetri ko baahar rakhane ke faisle se hairaan tha
 i will not comment about the coach, because the federation only feels that they cannot do anything without a foreign coach

 The license for all this will now be given by the Delhi government instead of Delhi Police
 pehle in sabko chalaane kaa license khan-paan yaa saaf-safai se sambandhit agency nahin balki police detii thi
 The Delhi government, which is fighting for the rights with the Delhi Police, has got a big success
 kendriya grih mantralay ne kanoon badalakar ab dilli police se licencing ke tamaam adhikaar chhinane kaa faisla liya he
 From theaters to swimming pools, the police had to go for the license too
 ab jaakar kendriya grih mantralay ne dilli police ke haathon se tamaam licencing adhikaar chhinane kii baat kahi he
 The Ministry of Home Affairs has now informed the Delhi Government by writing a letter to it
 jaankaar kah rahe hai ki aisa bahut pehle ho janaa chahie tha
 Former Delhi secretary Omesh Sehgal said, "when the government was formed in Delhi, these rights should have been got
" police ko kanoon vyavastha par dhyaan dena chahie na ki licencing par
 The letter from the Union Home Ministry, which is held by Delhi Aaj Tak, clearly states that the Central Government is going to make the Delhi Police Bill, 2013 soon
 isamen na sirf licencing adhikaar dilli sarkaar ko dene kii baat kahi gai he balki shila dikshit kii sarkaar se in adhikaron par raay bhi maangi gai he
 Delhi Aaj Tak also has the Delhi government's reply which it has written in response to this letter of the Ministry of Home Affairs
 haalanki mukhyamantri is chitthee kii jaankaree tak se saaf inkaar kar rahi hai
 Actually, this transfer of rights has been decided on the basis of the Supreme Court's decision in the gift cinema case
 isliye dilli sarkaar ne jo centre kii chitthee kaa jawaab taiyaar kiya he usamen is baat tak kaa zikr he ki license ke adhikaron kii aad main abtak dilli police apni manmarjee chalaati ai he

 com / n5zlhxfm2q Ever since the new Vehicle Act came into force in the country
 tab se afratfari kaa maahaul
 The challan of more than the cost of the car is being cut
 to kahin chaalaan katane se naaraaz log apni gadiyon main aag laga rahe hai
 So someone is going to pay two to two months to pay the challan amount
 magar puraa desh tab sann rah gaya jab maut ke is chaalaan kii khabar ai
 a traffic cop on noida-ghaziabad Road cut a challan of a 35-year-old man that he lost his life at the exact same place
 pehle ye kya kam the
 Now the government has given them a license to rob people in the name of challan
 ab to aisa maaloom padataa he ki sadak ke sartaaj yahi hai jise man kiya roak liya
 The one who wanted to start chanting in the name of the challan
 dhamkaane lage
 By stipulating arbitrary rules law, receipts of invoices started being grabbed
 jitne kii logon kii gaadiyaan nahin usase zyaada ke chaalaan deshbhar main kaate jane lage
 Scared people, really scared
 jo puure kaagazat lekar bhi gaadi kii driving seat par baith rahe hai
 Their hearts are also beating hard
 sirf is baat kaa khauf he ki kahin chaalaan naa cat jaae
 This awe is such a compliment that people are sitting down with heart after seeing the traffic policemen on the road
 or gadiyon ko roak rahe ye pulisavaale agar kisi gaadi par haath rakh den to uski haalat hi kharaab hui ja rahi he
 On a road connecting Ghaziabad and Noida, when a policeman hit a stick on this vehicle of Sharma ji's son, he was in awe of not knowing what was wrong with him
 or to or UP16-AC-0290 number kii gaadi ko rokkar to baqayada is kadar hadakaayaa gaya, jaise gaadi main musafir nahin aatanki baithe hon
 Muralchand Sharma's son Gaurav, sitting on the driving seat, dried up
 laga pataa nahin ab ye police jane kya karegaa
 Just while talking, suddenly a chest pain arose
 dil par haath gaya
 And the steps refused to lift the body
 gaurav ghutanon ke bal zamin par aa gaye
 Had a heart attack
 saansen ruk gayi thi
 An helpless father was ill
 zamin par pade apane bete ko uthaae
 Or took his wife in shock
 bedil trephic pulisavaala zamin par pade gaurav ko uthaane ke bajaae gaadi kii tasviren khinchataa ja rahaa tha
 Seeing this scene, no one would agree to help Rahegir
 betaa sadak par aidiyaan ragad rahaa tha
 And the father never raised the son lying on the ground
 kabhi besudh padi patni ko sambhalata
 Somehow a person agreed to help
 uski madad se baap ne bete ko gaadi main rakhaa
 Mother was rubbing her chest
 badahavaas baap ko samaj nahin aa rahaa tha ki kidar jaae
 The helpful man took the vehicle and took Gaurav to the nearest Fortis Hospital
 hospital ke emergency ward ne gaurav kii haalat dekhakar bhartee karne se inkaar kar diya
 The car was diverted from Sector 62 towards Kailash Hospital
 jahaan 10 se 20 minute tak jaanch karne ke baad unhen bete ke is duniya se guzar jane kii ittela kii gai
 The ground slipped from under the father's feet
 army skool se ritair hue moolchand sharma ko samaj hi nahin aayaa ki pal bhar main unke saath kya ho gaya
 Good good son died before his eyes
 mahaz 35 saal kaa unka betaa jisaki abhi kuch saalon pehle hi shaadi hui thi
 She is a 5-year-old innocent girl
 magar ek baap ke liye abhi sabase bada masalaa baaki tha
 He had to convey this news to the mother of that son
 jisane use apni kokh main rakhaa
 Raised nursery
 ye khabar use abhi uski patni ko bhi deni thi
 Which was till her way back home
 or ye khabar use abhi us maasoom bacchee ko bhi deni tha jo uske seene par sar rakhe bina soti nahin he
 Hi, this one father tells kisses to whom this heart is cheering
 kis kis ko sanbhale
 Comfort someone
 kaise wo khud ko bhi sanbhale
 Surely that father will be suffering a lot
 magar apane saare gam ko isane apane seene main jazb kar liya
 Because it has a long way to go now
 in boode kandhon par ise apane bete kii patni or bacchon kii zimmedaari uthaani he

 There was a lot of uproar in the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly today over the statement of 'muslim Free India' by Sadhvi Prachi, leader of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad
 sadasyon ne pidipi-bhaajapa sarkaar se sadhvi ke bayaan kii ninda karne kii maang kii
 During the Question Hour, Independent MLA Sheikh Abdul Rashid raised the issue and asked the government for clarification on this statement
 rashid ne kaha, ‘‘kya ‘desh badal rahaa he’ kaa matlab yahi he?’’ congress ke sadasyon ne bhi unka samarthan karte hue sadhvi praachi ke bayaan kii ninda kii
 Congress MLA GM Saruri said, "what is this Muslim-free India?" Do they want to repeat the Gujarat: 2002 riot: "deputy Chief Minister and BJP leader Nirmal Singh said that the statement has come in the newspapers and commenting on such statements is not right

 khaskar aparaadh se juden maamalon main
 The Maharashtra government has filed an affidavit in the Bombay High Court stating that it has issued guidelines to the police to maintain the privacy of the accused and the victim, including refusing to give the name of the accused, his photograph and any information related to it to the media
 has been done
 yah halafanama bombai hoicourt main daayar ek janhit yachika ke jawaab main diya gaya he
 According to lawyer Rahul Thakur, who filed a public interest litigation, the police give his complete information and photo to the media as soon as a case is registered
 nateeja ye hota he ki dosha sabit hone ke pehle hi vah shaks apradhi maan liya jaataa he, jo anyaay he
 The state government's affidavit contains 15 guidelines, which prohibit information on the victim and his family along with the accused
 iske saath hi aaropee kaa ikbaalia bayaan, uske paas se jabt hathiyaar or duusare saamaanon kii tasviir bhi media ko nahin dene ke liye kaha gaya he
 Moreover, in the case of murder, the photo of the deceased has also been prohibited from being given to the media
 iske mutabik, aisa tab tak karnaa he jab tak us maamle main aarope patr daayar na ho jaae or sabhi aaropee pakad na liye jaaen
 In such a situation, the question arises that is there an attempt to ban the media in the name of this media trial? Senior journalist Jatin Desai says such a ban ends transparency
 1993 main hue mumbai serial bam dhamaakon kaa hawala dete hue jatin desai poochhate hai ki us maamle main to ab bhi kai aaropee faraar hai to kya ham uski reporting hi na karen? According to Desai, it would have been good if the government had known the media's side before such a ban
 artiai kaaryakarta anil galgali ne to ise media kaa galaa ghontne kii koshish qaraar diya he
 Galgali says exposing the accused creates fear in them and stops the crime and the media only reports when the police register a case or arrest someone
 galgali kaa sawaal he police galat aadmi ko giraftaar hi kyon karti he? Whereas former IPS Sudhakar Suradkar says that when we talk of rights, duty also has to be understood
 rashtriya suraksha se jude maamalon me is tarahan kii pabandi jaruri he, lekin sabhi maamalon main nahin
 The special thing is that not only the media but also many policemen do not consider this circular to be completely correct
 unka kahana he ki hatya ke kai maamalon main mritak kii shinaakht hi media kii vajah se ho paati he
 Murder without identification cannot be solved
 tippaniyan The question is also arising that if there is a ban, then why not till the blame is proved? Why only till the charge sheet is filed? Even after that, many accused are released
 to kya tab uske saath anyaay nahin hoga? baharhaal, roak media ko kuch khaas jaankaree dene par lagi he
 Not to be published in the media, so it will not be called a ban on the media, but it is definitely an attempt to stop the media from giving information to a large extent
 yah bhi sach he ki aaropee or peedit ke adhikaar kaa khyaal rakhana chahie, lekin saath main ye dekhnaa bhi jaruri he ki jaanch main paardarshita bani rahe varna rasukhdaar log police se milakar maamle ko rafadpha karne se baj nahi aaenge
 After all, there are many such cases, which have been reached due to the media
 isliye media jaisaa paharedaar bhi jaruri he
 The affidavit was given in response to a PIL filed in the Bombay High Court
 janhit yachika daayar karne vaale vakil rahul thakur ke mutabik, kisi par bhi maamla darj hote hi police uski puri jaankaree, tasviir media ko de detii he
 The result is that the person is considered a criminal even before he is proved guilty, which is injustice
 rajya sarkaar ke halafname main 15 disha-nirdesh die gaye hai, jisamen aaropee ke saath peedit or uske parivaar kii jaankaree dene par bhi roak lagaai gai he
 Along with this, the confessional statement of the accused, arms and other items seized from him have also been asked not to be given to the media
 or to or hatya ke maamle main mritak kii tasviir bhi media ko dene par roak lagaai gai he
 According to this, it is to be done till the charge sheet in that case is filed and all the accused are caught
 aise main sawaal uthanaa lajimi he ki kahin ye media trial ke naam par media par pabandi kii koshish to nahin? varisht patrkaar jatin desai kaa kahana he ki is tarah kii pabandi paardarshita khatm karti he
 Citing the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, Jatin Desai asks if there are still many accused absconding in that case, shall we not report it? desai ke mutabik, is tarah kii pabandi ke pehle sarkaar media kaa paksh bhi jaan leti to acha hota
 RTI activist Anil Galgali has called it an attempt to strangle the media
 galgali kaa kahana he aropiyon ko benakaab karne se unamem bhay paidaa hota he or aparaadh par roak lagati he or media tabhi khabar chalaati he jab police maamla darj karti yaa phir kisi ko giraftaar karti he
 Galgali's question is why does the police arrest the wrong man? jabaki purv ipies sudhakar suradkar kaa kahana he ki jab ham haq kii baat karte hai to ferj bhi samajhnaa hoga
 This type of ban is necessary in matters related to national security, but not in all cases
 khaas baat he ki media hi nahin kai police vaale bhi is paripatrak ko puri tarah se thik nahin maanate
 He says that in many cases of murder, the identity of the deceased is due to the media
 bina shinaakht ke hatya kii gutthi sulajhaai nahin ja sakati
 The comments sawaal is baat par bhi uth rahaa he ki agar roak lagaani he to dosha sabit hone tak kyon nahin? sirf aarope patr daayar hone tak hi kyon? uske baad bhi to kai aaropee chhot jate hai
 Then will there be no injustice to him? Nonetheless, the ban is on giving some specific information to the media
 media main chhapane par nahin isliye ise media par pabandi to nahin kahenge, lekin ye media ko kaaphi had tak soochna dene se rokane kii koshish jarur he
 It is also true that the rights of the accused and the victim should be taken care of, but at the same time it is also necessary to see that there will be transparency in the investigation or else the influential people will not desist from meeting the police and hugging the case
 aakhir kai aise maamle hai, jo media kii vajah se hi anjaam tak pahunch paae hai
 Therefore a watchman like media is also necessary

 to kya tab uske saath anyaay nahin hoga? baharhaal, roak media ko kuch khaas jaankaree dene par lagi he
 Not to be published in the media, so it will not be called a ban on the media, but it is definitely an attempt to stop the media from giving information to a large extent
 yah bhi sach he ki aaropee or peedit ke adhikaar kaa khyaal rakhana chahie, lekin saath main ye dekhnaa bhi jaruri he ki jaanch main paardarshita bani rahe varna rasukhdaar log police se milakar maamle ko rafadpha karne se baj nahi aaenge
 After all, there are many such cases, which have been reached due to the media
 isliye media jaisaa paharedaar bhi jaruri he
 Citing the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, Jatin Desai asks if there are still many accused absconding in that case, shall we not report it? desai ke mutabik, is tarah kii pabandi ke pehle sarkaar media kaa paksh bhi jaan leti to acha hota
 RTI activist Anil Galgali has called it an attempt to strangle the media
 galgali kaa kahana he aropiyon ko benakaab karne se unamem bhay paidaa hota he or aparaadh par roak lagati he or media tabhi khabar chalaati he jab police maamla darj karti yaa phir kisi ko giraftaar karti he
 Galgali's question is why does the police arrest the wrong man? jabaki purv ipies sudhakar suradkar kaa kahana he ki jab ham haq kii baat karte hai to ferj bhi samajhnaa hoga
 This type of ban is necessary in matters related to national security, but not in all cases
 khaas baat he ki media hi nahin kai police vaale bhi is paripatrak ko puri tarah se thik nahin maanate
 He says that in many cases of murder, the identity of the deceased is due to the media
 bina shinaakht ke hatya kii gutthi sulajhaai nahin ja sakati
 The comments sawaal is baat par bhi uth rahaa he ki agar roak lagaani he to dosha sabit hone tak kyon nahin? sirf aarope patr daayar hone tak hi kyon? uske baad bhi to kai aaropee chhot jate hai
 Then will there be no injustice to him? Nonetheless, the ban is on giving some specific information to the media
 media main chhapane par nahin isliye ise media par pabandi to nahin kahenge, lekin ye media ko kaaphi had tak soochna dene se rokane kii koshish jarur he
 It is also true that the rights of the accused and the victim should be taken care of, but at the same time it is also necessary to see that there will be transparency in the investigation or else the influential people will not desist from meeting the police and hugging the case
 aakhir kai aise maamle hai, jo media kii vajah se hi anjaam tak pahunch paae hai
 Therefore a watchman like media is also necessary

 duniya ke sabase tej dhaavak isamen hissaa lete hai or olympics khelon ke dauraan to yah daud darshakon kaa sabase zyaada pasandida event bhi hota he
 As soon as the 100-meter race gets its name, those pictures of the Beijing Olympics start coming in, where Usain Bolt of Jamaica created history and everyone was surprised
 
 
 lekin ab landan olympics main bolt ke alaava bhi kai aise chehre hai, jo baazi maar sakate hai, or dharti par maujuud sabase tej insaan hone kaa rutaba hasil kar sakate hai
 
 
 However, the biggest contender to win this race is still Usain Bolt, and his name also holds a world record in this event
 
 
 unhone germany ke berlin shahar main varsh 2009 main hui world athletics championships main yah samay nikaala tha
 
 
 Apart from this, he won the gold medal in the 100-meter, 200-meter and 400x100-meter relay in the last Olympic Games, ie, 2008 in Beijing city of China
 
 
 bolt ke baad jamaica ke hi yohan blake is daud ko jeetne ke duusare sabase bade daavedaar hai
 
 
 Yohan Blake is the defending World Champion, and his best time of 9

 vaise bhi tyson ge un teen athleates main shaamil hai, jinhone bolt ko maat di he
 
 
 The comments inke baad zikr karnaa hoga, america ke pratibhashali dhaavak justin gatelin kaa, jinhone varsh 2004 main hue athens olympics main gold jeeta tha, or tab se yah dhaavak vakt-vakt par apane hone kaa ehsaas karwaata rahaa he

 ek or naam he, bolt ke hi hamawatan asafa powell kaa, or unka daawa bhi kisi se kam nahin
 
 
 Powell's name is the record for finishing the 100-meter race in the world in less than 10 seconds

 mumbai main hone vaale final main chennai super kings or sunrisers hyderabad khitaabi jang main jor aajamaaish karenge
 Both teams have performed brilliantly throughout the tournament, but now the turn is the last blow
 is bich ek dilachasp aankada yah kahata he ki match koi bhi jite chennai or emes dhoni aaj kai record apane naam karenge
 Apart from this, a connection of Delhi has come out in the final which may surprise you
 dhoni or chennai banaaenge recorddarasal, chennai ne abhi tak 9 ipel main hissaa liya he, inamen se saat baar chennai final main pahunchi he
 While Chennai captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni will play the final for the 8th time, Dhoni has participated in all 11 IPL seasons so far
 dhoni ne 7 baar chennai kii taraf se or ek baar pune kii taraf se final khelaa he
 This is also a strange coincidence, if we talk about coincidence, it is going in favor of Chennai today
 darasal, chennai points teble main duusare number par rahi thi, or abhi tak ke das sijan main se duusare number par rahane vaali team ne paanch baar khitaab apane naam kiya he
 Delhi will make Chennai the champion! You must be wondering what is Delhi's job when the match is between Hyderabad and Chennai
 darasal, abhi tak jab bhi dilli points teble main sabase neeche rahi he to number do kii team hi vijeta bani he
 It has happened three times so far
 2011 -chennai, champion2013 -mumbai, champion2014 -kolkata, champion2018 -???aapako bataa den ki chennai ne qualifire 1 main hyderabad ko haraakar final main jagah banaai thi, vahiin hyderabad ne qualifire 2 main kolkata ko haraakar final main jagah banaai he

 The court has ordered the BCCI to give Sreesanth an opportunity to be heard and set a sentence within 3 months
 supreme court ne kaha ki bisisiai srisanth par apane lagaae pratibandh par phir se vichaar karen
 The court said that in three months the BCCI should decide
 adaalat ne kaha ki bisisiai srisanth kaa bhi paksh sune
 The Supreme Court said that the lifetime ban is more
 justise ashok bhushan kii adhyakshata vaali supreme court kii ek bench ne bisisiai se kaha ki vah srisanth ko di gai sajaa ke bare main teen maheene ke andar hi jald faisla kare
 Now Sreesanth will have to give a verdict within three months on what punishment will be given to him after removing the ban imposed on him
 bataa den ki bisisiai ne srisanth par ipel-2013 main spot phixing kaa doshi paae jane par ajivan pratibandh lagaaya tha
 Sreesanth filed a petition in the Supreme Court against this
 isse pehle bisisiai ne court main kaha ki srisanth par bhrashtachar, sattebaaji or khel ko beizzat karne ke aarope hai
 Spot fixing case: Supreme Court in its order asked the BCCI to reconsider s Sreesanth's plea within three months

 In July 2015, all 36 accused in the spot-fixing case, including Sreesanth, Ankit Chavan and Ajit Chandila, were acquitted by the Patiala House Court from a criminal case
 srisanth ne 2005 main srilanka ke khilaaf nagpur main ekadivasiy match ke saath antarrashtriya cricket main padaarpan kiya tha

 srisanth ne 27 test main 37
 87 wickets at an average of 59 while 33 from 53 matches in odis

 It is said that love and passion, then age does not come in the way

 Finally, at the age of 94, he is going to get a degree from college
