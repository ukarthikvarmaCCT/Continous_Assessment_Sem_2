 Lord Shiva is pleased with the 16th Monday fast

 Story of Monday fast: According to 'shiva Mahapuran', while Mata Parvati and Shiva were returning after hearing the story from Agastya Muni, Bholenath saw that his deity Lord Rama was wandering in disconnection to Mother Sita
 unhen dekhne ke baad shiv ne unhen pranaam kiya, magar mata parvati ke man main ram kii pariksha lene kaa vichaar aayaa
 On requesting Bholenath, she reached to test Lord Rama, but upon seeing Parvati, Lord Rama gave Mother's address to Parvati and said, "where are you here, Bholenath? Where is Parvati, identified by God and hiding the word of Mother Shiva resorted to lies
 parvati ne kaha ki bhagwaan ram ne unhen nahin pahachaanaa
 After meditating on this, when Lord Shiva came to know that Rama addressed him to his mother, he gave up Parvati
 parvati ke tyaag kaa ek kaaran yah bhi rahaa ki ram ne parvati ko mata kaha tha, isliye unhone apane aradhy dev kii mata ko patni rup se tyaag kar diya
 From this it can be inferred that Lord Shiva can do anything for his devotees

" " This is the story of a girl whose time, by throwing a pen out of her hand, took a gun and made Chambal's rugged home and gave her an identity that became synonymous with awe - Dasu Sundari Renu Yadav (24)
 adaalat ne uske ateet se daaku hone ke daag ko mitaakar police kii filein band kar deen lekin renu kaa khanaabadosh jivan badastoor abhi bhi jari he
 Renu, who lives with her uncle Shiv Singh Yadav in a township in Kalyanpur area of kanpur, looks no less than an athlete
 neeli genes, safed shart or pairon main spotïrs shoej, kad 5 foot 8 inch or maathe par laal tikaa
 His eyes still float in his eyes, which changed his life completely
 aureya jile ke gaanv jamalipur main rahane vaale vidyaram yadav kii paanch santanon main sabase badi renu padhai main shuru se hi medhaavi thi
 On 29 November 2003, while going from school to school, he was abducted by the dreaded dacoit Chandan Yadav and paid Rs 10 lakh from his father
 kii phiroti maangi
 But it was not possible to raise such a large amount for Vidyaram, who runs his family by cultivating only 5-6 bighas of land
 ve police adhikariyon ke chakkar lagaate rahe
 On not getting the ransom money, Chandan started harassing Renu
 renu bataati he, ''apharan ke baad do hafte tak meraa haath-pair baandhakar rakhaa gaya
 Food was given enough to keep breathing
 kuch din baad chandan yadav ne mujhe apane gang kii dasyu sundari ghoshit kar diya
 Gave gun in hands
 mere paas uski baat maanane ke sivaa koi chaara na tha
 During every incident of Chandan Gang, i had to scare people with my name
 ”iske baad uttar pradesh, rajasthan or madhya pradesh ke jangalon main chandan yadav kii hatya, dakaiti, apharan, lut jaisi 17 vaardaaton main dasyu sundari renu kaa naam bhi bataur mulgim shaamil ho gaya
 The series lasted until January 4, 2005
 khud ko dasyu samraat ghoshit kar chuke ramvir gurjar or chandan ke bich isi raat gangvaar hua, jisamen chandan maaraa gaya
 Ramveer took Renu hostage
 lekin behad main uskaa raaj bhi zyada din nahin chalaa
 On the night of 15 January 2005, while the other gang members were resting, Ramveer attacked Renu with impunity
 chhina-jhapati ke bich uske haath esaelaar lag gai or usne sari goliyaan ramvir ke seene main utaar deen
 After wandering in a dense rug for seven days, she reached her home
 daakuon ke changul se chhuti renu ke saath police kaa ravaiya bhi kam khaufnak nahin tha
 On 14 February 2005, then Etawah SSP Daljit Chaudhary, along with the Kotwali in-charge, reached Renu's house and brought him to Kotwali, assuring security
 vahaan pahunchate hi use giraftaar kar liya gaya or jalon, itawa, kanpur dehaat samet kai jilon main chandan yadav par darj sabhi 17 mukademe renu par thope die gaye
 She was now behind bars and had to fight the law
 dalajit choudhary ab dilli main pratiniyukti par tainaat hai
 He refuses to comment on the allegations being leveled against him
 udhar airforce ke purv sainik or ramabai nagar ke jila panchayat sadsy renu ke chachaa shiv singh ne kanoonee ladaai main apni bhatiji kaa puraa saath diya
 The court acquitted Renu from all 17 cases
 adaalat ne is maamle main police kii karrwai ko behad gaiyr jimmedaarana maanate hue use kadi fatkaar lagaai
 Renu was released from Nari Bandi Niketan of Lucknow on May 29 this year after winning a seven-year court battle
 ab vah aaazaad he
 But the rugged have not left him yet
 renu ke haathon buree tarah ghayal hue daaku ramvir gurjar ne shaareerik takalif badaae par apane bhai arvind gurjar ke saath madhya pradesh sarkaar ke saamne aatmasamarpan karne main hi bhalaai samajhi
 But his gang members present in the rugged are now pressuring Renu to take charge of the gang and are threatening to kill him for not doing so
 renu ne janata darshan main mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav se isaki likhit shikaayat kii or suraksha kii guhaar bhi lagaai he
 Renu's journey in life has been very volatile, but she does not want to end her war here
 uskaa sapana ab peedit, satai hui mahilaon ke liye kaam karne kaa he
 If this path leads him to politics, then he is ready to step there too

 In such a situation, police action will be taken in the fields where photographs of poppy will be seen

 The Naxalites are also involved in opium cultivation, especially in the districts affected by the Jharkhand state of Khunti, Gumla, Giridih, Chatra, Ranchi, Seraikela, Lohardaga, Gumla and Simdega
 bataaya jaataa he ki notebandi ke baad baikfoot par aae naksaliyon ke liye ab opium kii kheti aay kaa aasaan jariya ban rahaa he
 Indeed, there is a tremendous demand for opium in international markets
 isaki vajah se in bazaaron main opium oonchi keemton par bechi jaati he
 Naxalites are busy trying to earn big money by intimidating the villagers or by luring more money in such a way
 opium kii kheti ke liye aise sthanon kaa chayan kiya gaya he jo aamajan or police kii najaron se kaaphi dur or pahaado or jangalon se ghire jagahon main hote hai
 In such a situation, the access of these forces is not easy

 Last year, 500 acres of poppy crop was destroyed in Khunti district alone

 But the police administration is also surprised to see its increasing yields year after year

 Do and enjoy yellow things
 - agar pile vastra dhaaran kiye jaaen to puja ke parinaam ati shubh honge
 - Whatever is the prayer after this, especially with regard to the children, what are the consequences of the weakening of the impure chakra? - The purified chakra is situated just behind the throat - its weakness weakens the power of speech - due to stuttering and There is also the problem of dumbness - it can also cause problems of ear and nose throat - due to its weakening, person cannot attain perfections and powers

 Here, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes in the country issued summons to the officials of the Ministry of External Affairs and the Union Home Ministry to help in the treatment of Sarabjit Singh
 bhaajapa ne sarkaar par sarbajit kii suraksha sunishchit karaane main vifal rahane kaa aarope lagaaya
 Meanwhile, the government has said that every effort will be made to bring Sarabjit back home
 videsh rajya mantri paranit cor ne ravivaar ko kaha ki maanviyata ke aadhaar par prayaas kiya jayega
 The attack on Sarabjit has been widely condemned
 pakistan ke akhabaaron ne is maamle main jaanch se sach saamne aane kii ummid jataate hue maamle main keval jail karmiyon ke nilamban ko naakaafi bataaya he
 The condition of Indian prisoner Sarabjit Singh, who is facing death sentence on charges of terrorist attacks in Pakistan, is being treated by doctors at Jinnah Hospital in Lahore as serious and said that his chances of survival are very low
 sarbajit ko dekhne ke liye uske parivaar ke log amritsar se ravivaar dopaher lahore pahunch gaye
 Family members have requested permission to take Sarabjit to India or any other country for treatment
 lahore ke aspataal main dekhne ke baad sarbajit kii bahan dalbir cor ne kaha, "jab hamane isiu main use dekha tab vah vahaan besudh padaa hua tha
 The doctors told us that his condition is critical
 meharbaani karke hamaare bhai ko bachaane main hamaari madad kiijie
 " sarbajit ko dekhne ke liye uski bahan dalbir cor ke saath sarbajit kii patni sukhpreet cor or do betiyaan swapndeep or punam bhi lahore pahunchi he
 Doctors at the hospital said that Sarabjit's condition was critical and there was little hope of his survival
 dalbir ne kaha, "uski betiyon ne papa kahkar pukaara, uski patni ne bhi aawaaj lagaai, lekin vah pathar kii tarah padaa rahaa
 i do not understand what to say
 " unhone kaha, "vah puri tarah achet he
 He does not know anything
 vah ventilator par he
 i can feel her breath and heartbeat
 " Dalbir said, "I am pleading with my government
 meharbaani karke use ilaaj ke liye kisi duusare desh le jaaie
 So far during the fight for his release, i got only a blank assurance
 " 49-year-old Sarabjit suffered serious head injuries in an attack on bricks and other sharp objects of four to five prisoners at Kot Lakhpat Jail on Friday
 pakistan main aatankwaadi hamale ke aarope main faansee kii sajaa paae sarbajit pichley 22 varshon se jail main band he
 Sarabjit's family claims that he is innocent and accidentally crossed the border to Pakistan in August 1990, where he was arrested
 dalbir ne sawaal kiya, "main puuchhati hum ki sarbajit par hamalaa karne ke liye jail ke bheetar inten, saria, kattar or anya chijen kaise pahunchin
 This is a big conspiracy
 " Sarabjit's Pakistani lawyer Awais Sheikh has also alleged a deep conspiracy behind the attack
 apana naam jaahir nahin hone dene kii shart par ek doctor ne bataaya ki sarbajit ke sir kii haddiyon main ghaatak chotein ai hai
 During medical examination, it was found that he was unconscious due to major head injuries
 sarbajit ko police kii kadi suraksha main alag saghan chikitsa ikai main rakhaa gaya he jahaan doctoron ke alaava kisi or ko jane kii ijaajat nahin he
 The first secretary in Indian High Commission in Pakistan, CS Das went to the hospital to see Sarabjit
 idhar, nai dilli main rashtriya anusuchit jati ayog ne videsh mantralay tathaa kendriya grih mantralay ke adhikariyon ko sarbajit kii madad ke mudde par samman jari kiya

 They begin to believe in God
 unke peeche pagal ho jate hai
 If it does not, then millions of people do not do Tandava for Baba like Ram Rahim trapped in rape case
 ye hai aadhunik baabaaon kii dhong kala
 
 
 1- The art of making farce is the biggest art of alleged hypocritical saints from Asant Ram Asaram to Radhe Maa
 swang yani ek charitra khud ko duusare charitra main dhaal kar naatak karata he
 If you take a close look at the body language of Asaram and Radhe Maa, then this farce is clearly visible
 dhongi sant khud ko bhagwaan ke rup main pradarshit karte hai
 We try to create imaginary postures and gestures of God
 bachapan se hi ham tivi-serial yaa poster main dikhne vaale bhagwaan ko apane dimag main sahaj sahej lete hai
 In such a situation, when these hypocritical babas pretend like them, we think that they are God
 ham unki taraf aakarshith hote chale jate hai
 They worship him as God
 isi kaa phayda uthaakar ichhadhari baba or asaram jaise kathith sant logon kaa shoshan karte hai
 Most of the women fall prey to them
 2- baat banane or bargalane kii kshamtakathith sant rampal or asaram jaise logon kii vakpatutaa kii vajah se bhole-bhaale log aasaani se unki baton main aa jate hai
 They have that art of talking, which hypnotizes people
 iske baad unki har baat sahi lagane lagati he
 Fraud in their words, these hypocritical babas start tricking people
 tarah-tarah ke bahaane banaakar unase paise anthte hai
 The public caught up in his talk realizes this too late
 3- aakarshak or alag tarah kaa aavarandhongi baabaaon ke cese main aksar dekha gaya he ki ye aakarshak aavaran main hote hai
 For example, consider the clothes and living conditions of wishful Baba Bhimananda, Radhe Maa, Swami Nityananda and Nirmal Baba
 ye saamaanya se hatakar paridhaan pahante hai
 Their seating positions, clothing style, seating pattern, stage furnishings are unique, which attracts people towards them
 4- kamajori kaa phayda uthaane kii kaladhongi baabaaon ko logon or dharm kii kamajoriyon ko phayda uthaane kii kala bakhubi aati he
 They know what are the weaknesses of the people
 ve use dharm se jod dete hai
 People do not even know that they are playing with them in the name of faith
 aise farji santon ke nishane par garib or anpadh log hote hai
 Some rich go to their shelter only to whiten their black money
 5- branding or marketing kii kalis jamaane main branding or marketing sabase badi kala maani jaati he
 This is the biggest tool of impostor babas
 tivi, akhbaar or soshal media ke madhyam se ye log khud ke paise se khud kaa prachaar karaate hai
 Claiming to be an avatar of God, he claims to have overcome all the problems of the people
 apane dukh main uljhi janata inke jhaanse main aasaani se aa jaati he
 Due to some tricks, they start to believe in God
 kehete hai jhooth kitna bhi shaktishaalee ho, uskaa pardaafash jarur hota he
 Yes, the biggest examples of this are alleged Sant Ram Rahim, Asaram, Ichchadhari Baba Bhimananda, Nirmal Baba, Rampal and Radhe Maa
 der hi sahi inaki sachai se pardaa uthaa chukaa he
 Yes, it hurt, so people's faith
 prabhavit hui he, to dharm kii bhaavana
 There was a heated debate in the Rajya Sabha on the issue of giving 10 percent reservation to the poor of the general class
 sadan main charchaa ke dauraan jab samaajawaadee party ke ramgopal yadav bol rahe the tab unke or bhartiya janata party ke adhyaksh amit shah ke bich tikhi bahes chhid gai
 Ram Gopal Yadav said that there would be no benefit from the bill the government is bringing, then immediately Amit Shah reminded him of Muslim reservation
 kya hua sadan main


?darasal, saamaanya varg ko milane vaale 10 fisadi aarakshan ke liye pesh kiye gaye sanshodhan bill par charchaa ke dauraan ramgopal yadav ne kaha, ‘sarkaar jo bill laa rahi he usase koi laabh hone vaala nahin he, jin garibon ke liye sarkaar baat kar rahi he unhen laabh hi nahin milegaa
 'SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav said,'
 
 
 kyonki un ladakon kii merit jo aegi wo to kaaphi upar aegi
 Meaning, you reduced the merit figure, you cut the merit short and increased the number
 ek saal baad aapako asar dikhne lagegaa
 'amit Shah gave the answer
 
 
 ramgopal yadav ke isi vaakya ke saath hi bich main tokate hue bhartiya janata party ke adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha, ‘maine baithe hue koi tippanee nahin kii, aap merit kii baat kar rahe hai lekin jab aap muslim aarakshan laae to tab kya merit kii sankhya kam nahin hogi
 If you bring Muslim reservation, what will happen to the children of merit
 aap apana 2012 kaa menifesto dekh lijie
 "why did not bring the bill first?" Responding to this, Ram Gopal Yadav said, "in our manifesto, there was also an appeal to the Center to provide reservation for the economically weaker general class
 ’charchaa ke dauraan ramgopal ne kaha ki unki party is bill kaa samarthan karti he
 He said that the government could have brought this bill at any time, but the goal of the government is not the economically poor upper caste but 2019 elections
 agar inaki dil main eemaandaaree hoti to 3-4 saal pehle yah bill aa jaataa

 DPIIT has recognized 4328 startups in Uttar Pradesh
 khaas baat yah he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke 'start-ap india' abhiyaan ko lekar is baar gujarat main khaas asar nahin dikh rahaa kyonki unke grih rajya gujarat se is baar mahaj 2693 starpeps ko hi panjikrut karaayaa gaya he
 Punjab, who is constantly experimenting with new things and is very interested in business, is looking far behind in starting a start-up
 yahaan se mahaj 498 start-ap shuru karne ko manyata mili he
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who is running the government with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), does not see much enthusiasm in Bihar even in this state and only 700 startups have been recognized here

 Gujarat was adjudged as the Best Performer State
 iske baad top parformar rajyon main karnataka, kerala, odisha or rajasthan ko rakhaa gaya tha
 Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana states in the number three leaders group
 jabaki uttar pradesh samet 5 rajyon ko mahatvakankshi rajya ke rup main shaamil kiya gaya
 Bengaluru topped the city, while a Forbes India report says that Karnataka capital Bangalore ranks first in terms of starting the highest number of start-ups in 2019
 bengalooru main is saal 3282 start-ap shuru kiye gaye
 While it is followed by Delhi (2865), Mumbai (2363), Hyderabad (1225) and Pune (1134)

 Amongst the top 10 cities in terms of start-ups, 33 start-ups have Unicorn status, with the highest number of 14 start-ups from Bengaluru
 phir dilli (7) or mumbai (6) kaa number aata he
 Among the top 10 cities, big cities like Noida, Ahmedabad and Kolkata do not have a single startup that has unicorn status

 Small cities are adopting the 'startup India' campaign faster than the big cities of the country
 indore, jaipur, raipur tathaa chandigarh jaise shaharon main yah abhiyaan zyada kamyaabi hasil kar rahaa he
 The growing craze of start-ups in small towns (GETTYIMAGES) There are several important reasons behind the increasing trend of startups in small cities
 bade shahar trephic samasya, sadakon par baari bheed or mahangaai kii maar jhelte hai
 Big cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru have to suffer the loss of many working hours due to heavy traffic every day
 jabaki chote shaharon main dekha jaae to yahaan par trephic jam kii koi badi samasya nahin hoti
 People do not waste time due to no jam
 mazdooree sasti hoti he
 The cost is also not high
 duniya kaa teesraa sabase bada start-ap hub'starop abhiyaan' dhire-dhire apni pahchaan bana rahaa he or desh ke yuva ise apanaate hue naukari kii jagah naukari dene kii sthiti main aate dikh rahe hai
 According to NASSCOM, India is the third largest start-up hub in the world
 noscom or jinov ne pichley saal oktober main 'indian starop echosystem 2018: approching escape velocity' naam se jari report ke anusaar, bharat duniya kaa teesraa sabase bada start-ap hub ho gaya he
 However, India is far behind compared to the 2 countries at the top
 sabase safal companiyon yani unicorn ke numberon ke aadhaar par dekha jaae to america or china main sabase zyada kramshah 126 or 77 unicorn hai jabaki bharat main isaki sankhya 18 tak pahunch gai
 There are 15 unicorns in England and 6 in Germany
 2018 main unicorn list main bharat kii 8 companiyaan shaamil huin or yah ek calendar saal main uskaa sarvshereshth pradarshan rahaa
 After India's startup, ahead of the US, India's speed is faster than Amorica in terms of joining the Unicorn Club
 america main ausatan 6 se 8 saal main starop unicorn main apni jagah banane main kaamyaab hoti he jabaki bharat main starop ko unicorn banane main 5 se 7 saal lagate hai
 However, India is behind China in this matter and it takes 4 to 6 years there
 2017 main global innovations index main bharat ko 3 sthaan kaa phayda hua he
 In 2017, India was ranked 60 and in 2018 it was ranked 57
 bengalooru global top-3 shaharbengalooru tech starop launch karne ke maamle main duniya ke 3 bade shaharon main shaamil he
 According to NASSCOM report, Bangalore Tech is the fastest growing city in terms of start-ups
 2018 main yahaan par kul start-ap main se akele 1200 tech starop shuru kiye gaye
 The NASSCOM report says that investment in start-ups has almost doubled
 2017 main jahaan 2 billian dollar kii raashi starop main nivesh kii gai thi wo 2018 main badhkar 4
 2 billion dollars
 isse yah andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki nivesh badhane se starop ke tarakkee karne kii sambhaavna main sudhaar hota he
 40 thousand people got direct employment in 2018 through the startup
 jabaki 1
 6 lakh to 1
 7 lakh logon ko apratyaksh tareeke se rojgaar mila
 The success of a startup will have a direct impact on job creation and opens the way for many people to get jobs
 starop ko badhaava dene ke liye vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne pichley hafte bajet pesh karte hue elaan kiya tha ki starop ko ab anjal tex nahin dena hoga
 Also the Income Tax Department will not be investigated for start-ups
 saath hi starop ke liye doordarshan par kaarykram bhi pesh kiye jaaenge
 The government's decision not to collect angel tax is laudable as many startups complained that they had to pay 30% tax under section 56 (2) (8B) of Income Tax Act-1961 for raising investment from angel investor
 Have met
 sarkaar kii koshish start-ap ko aage tak le jane kii he or iske liye kai tarah kii chhot bhi di ja rahi he
 However, many more reliefs were expected for startup companies from this budget, which were not met
 baavjood iske kuch rajyon main jahaan starop behad kaamyaab dikhataa he, to kai rajyon main isko lekar sakriyata kii kami dikh rahi he
 If the 'startup India' campaign succeeds, not only will the investors benefit, but thousands of people will get direct and indirect employment

 The date of UPSC Civil Services Exam 2017 is approaching
 parikshaarthiyon ke paas taiyaari ke liye ab bas kuch hi vakt bachaa he
 In such a situation, it is important that you use this last time for revision
 UPSC Civil Services Exam yani IAS banane ke liye lakhon chaatr pariksha dete hai
 But only a few are successful
 aisa kyon? iske peeche kii vajah hai unki galtiyaan
 8 Tips to Crack UPSC IAS Exam 2015 Candidates who participate in UPSC Civil Services Exam usually make these 10 mistakes, which become a mountain amidst their success
 1
 If you think that for UPSC Civil Services Exam, unlimited studies have to be done and they are more prepared than CSE celebrations
 isaki vajah se unka samay bhi nasht hota he or taiyaari bhi puri nahin ho paati
 Know how much IAS exam changed in 5 years 
 
 2
 It is also a big mistake not to look at the question papers of the past year
 pichley saal yaa pichley kuch varshon ke question papers se pariksha ke pattern or sawaalon kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 3
 jitani kitaaben, utana kanfusion
 Understand this
 bazaar main milane vaali har kitaab main jaankariyaan sahi hi hon, yah jaruri nahin
 Some students make the mistake of buying and reading a lot of books
 isse behatar hoga ki aap kuch chuninda kitabon ko khariden or unheen se padhai karen
 Such questions asked in IAS exam, which you will be shocked by reading
 
 
 4
 One of the biggest mistakes is to ignore NCERT books
 agar aap taiyaari ke liye ensiiarti kii kitaaben nahin padhate to aap ye maan kar chalem ki aap iees kii pariksha main safal nahin honge
 If you want to become an IAS, then prepare 5
 IAS kii safalataa is baat par bhi nirbhar karti he ki aapane taiyaari ke liye tim ko kaise manage kiya he
 The strategy of time should be something in which after preparation, there is also enough time for revision
 par zyaadaatar chaatr pariksha ke din tak taiyaari main hi jute rahete hai
 They have no time for revision

 Electoral populism is not new, but this time something new and extremely dangerous has happened
 raajnneeti ghaatak pratikwaad par utaaru he
 Governments cannot provide respectable annual earnings to people at any cost
 lekin labhaarthiyon ke liye naganya aay sahaayta bhi bajaton kii qamar todgaye ke liye paryaapt he
 Income support of 'modi-farmer' is only Rs
 500
 maheene (dainik mazdooree kaa paanch fisadi) kaa he
 Despite all efforts, Congress's mega budget MNREGA was able to provide only 100 days of annual employment
 sarkaar kii duusari sahaayta, pension, beemaa yojanaon ke vartmaan va sambhavit laabhon ko bazaar or jeene ke kharch kii roshni se maapie, aapako sarkaron kii samaj par taras aa jayega
 Due to huge population, budget deficits, huge government debt and twenties in recognition of beneficiaries, income support is blighted in every way, but despite the tents of the budget being torn, the leaders are on this spectacle, which makes it difficult to change the lives of beneficiaries
 
 modi sarkaar kii kisaan inakam saport suvichaarit nahin he
 The government had already spoiled the budget by increasing the support price of crops
 yah faisla janvari main janma jab rahul gandhi ne garibon ko nunatam aay kaa vaada oochaal diya
 Hence 'modi-farmer' will come into effect from December last year
 telugana (kharch 120 arab ru
 ), Odisha (spending Rs 33 billion
 ) or jharkhand (kharch 22 arab ru
 ) Instead of stopping this risk, the central government also rode this election horse which will soon throw the economy on the path of trouble
 aage kii raah kuch aisi hone vaali he

 States will not stop their 'kisan-daan' schemes, but after this many other states can bring similar schemes
 yani ek ghaatak pratikwaadi hode, bas shuru hone vaali he2

 The ad-hocism of income support is an elegy of reforms
 1
 Governments do not want to work hard to increase income through structural changes in the economy and market expansion
 2
 They do not want to improve the social program but just want to buy votes
 3
 Government bailouts lead to looting of the system that distributes it
 tamaam scimen iskaa udhaaharan hai
 The Center's fiscal health in India has been more or less balanced during the two and a half decades of reforms
 yah pehla mauka he jab vittiya tantra main karj itane bade paimaane par ekatra hua he
 The debt-gdp ratio of the Center is at a high of 70 per cent

 Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said that every procedure has been followed by the Modi government regarding the Rafale deal
 raksha mantri ke mutabik deal ko lekar sarkaar ne kuch bhi galat nahin kiya
 In a special interview with India Today, the Defense Minister questioned the Congress, 'if 95% of the negotiations with the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited had been completed during the UPA tenure, then the government of that time had completed the remaining 5% of the work
 Why not take steps
 wo (congress) bataaen ki us bache 5% ke peeche kya raaj tha? kisne tab unhen deal ke liye aage badhane se roka tha
 Nirmala Sitharaman quoted the news in an English newspaper quoting the then Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Defense as completely false
 raksha mantri ne kaha ki pehali baat to cabinet ne agast 2016 main rafel deal ko manjuuri di thi naa ki sitambar main
 The agreement was reached in September
 raksha mantri ne kaha ki keemat, technical pahaluon, quality aadi par pradhanmantri faisla nahin lete, in sabake liye alag dailygation hote hai jo tamaam chizon par gaur kar apni report dete hai
 According to the Defense Minister, in the newspaper report, the immediate joint secretary (excision manager) was referring to the note of disagreement, his own letter of approval was signed
 raksha mantri ne ye bhi kaha ki wo adhikari training ke liye short turm course karne videsh gaye the jo ki pehle se hi tay tha
 Rahul Kanwalvipaksha, while interviewing Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, alleged that there was talk of taking 126 Rafale aircraft during UPA which was reduced to 36 by the NDA government and defense supply procedures were not followed
 is tarah ke aaropon par nirmala sitaraman ne kaha ki upie ke vakt flive haalat main 18rafellene kii baat ho rahi thi, jo ki ek scawadran ke liye hi paryaapt hote, baaki sab kaa HAL ke saath ek timeline ke tahat nirmaan hota
 The Defense Minister made it clear that in view of the shortage of fighter aircraft in the Indian Air Force, as an emergency, it decided to take 36 Rafale in flyway condition, which would have started being supplied from September 2019
 baaki rafel vimaanon ke liye RFI (request for Interest) ke jariye aage kadam badhaati
 Nirmala Sitharaman dismissed the allegations of being shown early by the Modi government for the Rafale deal
 unhone kaha, ‘bhartiya vayusena keldaku vimanonke squadran 44 se ghat kar 33 tak aa gaye the
 By 2014, the UPA government did not understand the need to take immediate steps in this direction
 jis tarah ab wo chor-chor kaa shor machaane main urja vyarth kar rahe hai tab unhone wo urja kyon nahin dikhaai thi jo unhen sarkaar ke naate dikhaani chahie the
 That is why we took the step to buy 36 Rafale aircraft in flyway condition
 ’kabhi HAL ko asaksham bataane jaisaa bayaan nahin diyaraksha mantri se intervyuu main poocha gaya ki kya ye sahi nahin hota ki HAL ko agar technology transfar ke tahat ye vimaan banane kaa mauka miltaa to wo santhaan is kshetra main or sikhta-samajhataa or aage chalakar desh aatmanirbhar hota? raksha mantri ko HAL ke purv chif ke bayaan kaa hawala bhi diya gaya ki HAL jab chauthi peedi ke sukhoi 30 jaise aadhunik vimaan bana saktaa he to yahaan bhi safal rahata? raksha mantri ne kaha ki in sawaalon ko upie kaarykaal main jo raksha mantri rahe unase poocha janaa chahie ki unke vakt main ye sab karne ke liye kyon nahin kadam uthaae gaye
 The defense minister denied that he ever used a word like inefficient for HAL
 nirmala sitaraman ne daawa kiya ki unke vakt main har saal HAL ko 22,000 karod rupee jari kiye jabaki upie ke vakt ausatan har saal 10,000 karod hi die jate the
 Nirmala Sitharaman also denied that the government was adamant on not stating the purchase price of the Rafale aircraft
 raksha mantri ne saath hi kaha ki rafel deal ko lekar daal main kuch bhi kaala nahin he
 Nirmala Sitharaman did not directly state the purchase price of Rafael but said that she had already stated the price on the first three occasions which can be checked from the records
 raksha matri ke anusaar november 2016 ko raksha rajya mantri ne bhi ye keemat bataai
 On the opposition's allegations related to Anil Ambani, Nirmala Sitharaman said that no company is named in the inter-government clearance (agreements between governments)
 ye commercial nirnay hote hai
 The government does not decide about this
 ofaset ko lekar daso aviation or reliance dephence ke bich baatcheet ko lekar nirmala sitaraman ne kaha ki is bare main unke paas koi jaankaree nahin he
 Only when this information comes, they will be in a position to say something
 modi sarkaar par bhrashtachar or kroni capitelesm kaa ek bhi aarope nahinirmala sitaraman ne kaha, ‘modi sarkaar par saadhe chaar saal main bhrashtachar yaa kroni capitelesm kaa ek bhi aarope nahin hai
 Whatever allegations the Congress is making on the Modi government are baseless
 jahaan tak narendra modi par vipaksh ke hamalon kii baat he to varsh 2002 se hi unke khilaaf apshabdon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa rahaa he
 But they all know that even the word of corruption is not possible to come to them
 nirmala sitaraman ne kaha ki ve nahin jaanateen ki france ke purv raashtrapati francwa oland ne anil ambani kii company ko lekar kyon kaha ki use deal se jodna bharat sarkaar kaa faisla tha
 Nirmala Sitharaman did not deny that Hollande may have made this statement under pressure from the internal politics of France
 modi sarkaar kabhi desh kaa nuksaan nahin karegiraksha mantri ke mutabik raksha mantralay main ab nirnay liye ja rahe hai or wo bhi bina dallalon ke
 Nirmala Sitharaman stressed that the Modi government will never allow any harm to the country

 Election Results 2019: Interesting election was seen in Jat dominated Rohtak Lok Sabha seat of Haryana
 yahaan se jat pratyaashee ke hi jeetne ke myth ko bijepi ne dharashayi kar diya
 So far in the history of the Lok Sabha elections, no party had taken the risk of raising a non-jat candidate in this seat, but for the first time running the non-jat card in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP has fed lotus on the seat
 haryana ke prabhaavshaalee 'hooda gharaane' kaa garh maani jane vaali is seat se teen baar ke congress saansad deependra hooda ko bijepi ke dow
 Arvind Sharma has suffered defeat in an exciting match
 seat par ladaai itani rochak thi ki nateezon ke liye 24 may kii subah chaar baje tak samarthakon ko intjaar karnaa padaa
 It was decided to win and lose at the last minute
 purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ke bete deependra hooda ko romaanchak mukaable main sharma ne 7,503 voton ke antar se haraaya he
 The Congress has won ten times in the Lok Sabha elections held in Rohtak so far
 jisamen aath baar hooda gharaane ke sadsy hi yahaan se chune gaye
 This victory of the BJP is considered to be special in this sense as Bhupendra Singh Hooda spent a lot of budget during his tenure as Chief Minister between 2005-14 to strengthen his hold here
 jisase lagaataar ve jitate rahe
 Bhupendra Hooda, who was an MP till 2004, when he became the Chief Minister from 2005, he handed over the seat to son Deepender
 jiske baad se vah lagaataar jitate rahe
 Due to the strong hold of the Hooda gharana on the Jat dominant seat, the strong Modi wave failed in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections here
 tab congress pratyaashee deependra hooda ne yahaan bijepi ko 1
 Was defeated by 70 lakh votes
 magar is baar bijepi kii achook ranneeti se congress ko is iklauti bachi seat par bhi haar jhelni padi
 How BJP won? Total 16 in Rohtak
 66 lakh voters main chah lakh se adhik jat matadaataaon kii sankhya ko dekhte hue yah myth kaayam tha ki yahaan se jat pratyaashee hi jitegaa
 But this time the BJP tried to polarize votes by playing non-jat card, this strategy was successful
 bijepi ke ranneetikaron kaa maananaa tha ki jaaton ke vot par hooda parivaar kii majboot pakad he, aise main gaiyr jat ummidavaar khadaa kar gaiyr jat voton par focus karnaa jaruri he
 Due to the Modi wave in the elections, while the BJP was able to make a dent in some Jat vote banks, the non-jat voters united under the party's umbrella
 rohtak ke jaateey sameekaran dekhen to yahaan jaaton ke baad sabase zyada chaar lakh dalit hai, iske alaava kareeb do lakh yadav va anya jatiyon ke voter hai
 Congress, three-time MP Deepender Hooda could not save his seat in this Jat-dominated seat due to non-jats voting together with BJP
 arvind yadav kii achook ranneetibijapi ne haryana ke pradesh upaadhyaksh arvind yadav ko rohtak main hooda parivaar kaa garh dhwast karne ke liye morche par lagaaya
 Arvind Yadav, who has been associated with Rohtak for more than 30 years, prepared the entire blueprint of the election
 arvind ke plan ne rohtak main nayaa cheharaa hone ke baavjood peshey se chikitsak arvind sharma kii jeet kii raah aasaan kar di
 aajtak
 in se baatcheet main arvind yadav ne is jeet kaa puraa shrey modi lahar or rajya kii khatter sarkaar ke vikaas kaaryon ko diya
 He said that even though the area of rohtak was new for Arvind Sharma, he remained active from 6 am to 2 pm and registered a presence in 80 to 85 per cent of the constituencies
 yah apane aap main record he
 In the last days of polling, the public leaned in his favor and the result is today
 do baar jansangh kii jeet chhod den to yahaan bijepi ko pehali baar vijay mili he
 According to Arvind Yadav, there was a 'pro-incumbency wave' this time with the BJP government at both the Center and the state
 khatter sarkaar ne jis tarah se naukariyon main paardarshita sunishchit kii, usase janata ko laga ki is baar jati-dharm or kshetra se pare hatakar vot diya jaae
 This is the second time in the last three decades that the Hooda family lost the Lok Sabha seat of Rohtak only twice in three decades, when the Hooda family lost
 1991, 96, 98 tak bhupendra hooda lagaataar loksabhaa chunaav jitate rahe
 Then in 1999, the BJP-INLD alliance contested together
 tab inelo seat par captain inder singh ne bhupendra hooda ko haraane main safal hue the
 Arvind Yadav was also the election director at that time
 magar iske baad 2004 se 2014 tak phir seat par hooda parivaar kaa kabja rahaa
 Now BJP has won here in 2019
 bataa den ki aazaadee ke baad hue pehle chunaav1951-52 se lekar 1957 or phir 1967 ke chunaav main bhi rohtak seat par hooda parivaar ke ranbir singh jite the
 Only the Jana Sangh in 1962, 1971 and Chaudhary Devi Lal from the Janata Party in 1977, 1980 and Samajwadi Party in 1989 were successful in winning separate elections from the Hooda family
