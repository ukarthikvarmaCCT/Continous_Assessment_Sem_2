 There is a profile on Facebook, named Sankat Mochan Sant Shri
 is par computer baba se sambandhit kai video hai
 In this, a video has been posted on 8 March in which Baba wants to take out the yatra from April 1 to expose the scam in the name of planting trees along the banks of Narmada
 is video kii taraf photo jarnlist raaj patidaar ne hamaara dhyaan dilaayaa
 Raj Patidar has been doing photo journalism for 20 years
 is vakt riter se jude hai
 a poster has also been written which states that a forty-five day journey of 45 districts is going to leave
 isamen sampurna sadhu sant samaaj narmada ghotaalaa rath yatra nikaalane ja rahe hai
 It was headed by Computer Baba and Convenor was Pandit Yogha Mahant
 poster main kaha gaya he ki mukhyamantri ke anusaar 6 karod paudhon kaa ropan hua jiskaa kahin koi namonishaan nahin he
 The culprits should be punished by checking this large plantation
 narmada nadi main ho rahe avaidh utkhanan par turant roak lage
 Gaushala should be constructed in every panchayat and its protection should be given to sages and saints
 pradesh ke math mandiron kii sabhi samasyaon kaa turant niraakaran kiya Go kul milakar nau bindu hai is poster main
 Did the yatra, which ran from April 1 to May 15, change with the greed of the post of Minister of State
 jo baba log ghotaale kaa aarope laga rahe the, kah rahe the ki mukhyamantri kaa 6 karod paudhe lagane kaa daawa jhootha he, wo usee mukhyamantri se rajyamantri kaa pad le lete hai, isse raajnneeti kii saakh girti he yaa dharm kaa istemaal karne vaale in baabaaon kii sikh girti he
 The press asked a lot that you were alleging the Narmada scam, now you have become a minister
 aap tay kar sakate hai ki baabaaon kaa rajyamantri bananaa kitna jaays he
 Was the Minister of State made to stop their opposition
 kya narmada ke kinare vriksharopan ke ghotaale ko saamne aane se rokane ke liye in baabaaon ko mantri banaaya gaya
 Now the reporting in TV is less or else five reports could be shot within five hours and tell what is the condition of the 6 crore saplings that were planted
 philhal aap tivi par isi vishay par dibet to dekhenge magar sachai kabhi nahin jaan paaenge kyonki bahes ab hindu baba ke mantri banaae jane par virodh or maulavee wo mantri banane par chuppi jaise udaahranon ko lekar hone lagegi
 You will never know where the 6 crore trees went
 19 july 2017 ko hamaare sahyogi anuraag dwari ne ek report file kii thi
 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan started the Narmada Seva Yatra, advertisements were given for him not only in India but also in foreign newspapers
 is vigyaapan par rajya sarkaar ne 33 karod 7 lakh 40 hazaar or 344 rupee kharch kiye the
 The government gave this information in response to a question asked in the assembly
 is yatra ke kaaran tivi channelon ko vigyaapan ke rup main 13 karod 23 lakh mili the or akhabaaron ko 10 karod 77 lakh
 You will know that Namami Devi Narmade Seva Yatra was taken out in Madhya Pradesh from 11 December 2016 to 15 May 2017
 har din yatra par sirf prachaar prasar par 15 lakh rupee kharch hue the
 Then the government said that the amount of 33 crores is not much
 pichley saal 2 july ko mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne 6 karod vriksh lagane kaa lakshya rakhaa tha
 The goal was to create a world record
 jiske liye bakaayaka prashikshan diya gaya, taiyaari kii gai
 Even after this, the condition is that some Baba declares to expose the scam and he is made a minister
 maamla dharm or aasthaa kaa nahin he, us sawaal par pardaa daalane kaa he, jo 6 karod paudhon kii khoj kar rahe hai
 Computer Baba claims about himself that his mind is like a computer
 apane saath laptaap lekar ghoomte hai
 He has a grand ashram in Ahilyanagar, Indore
 bharat main computer kaa avishkaar nahin hua, magar is naam se baba hue jo aage chal kar rajyamantri bane
 It was not predicted by Nesthrodamus or Steve Jobs or Bill Gates
 inkaa asli naam he udai deshmukh
 They are often seen with the influential people of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh
 shaan or shaukat inaki pahchaan he
 
 
 The convoy of vehicles always moves along
 bhayyuji maharaj ko raajnneetik rup se taaqatvar santon main gina jaataa he, inke pita maharashtra main congress ke netaa rahe hai
 His name came up for discussion during Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement when he was approached by the UPA government to persuade Anna Hazare
 narmadanand maharaj hanuman jayanti or ram navami ke maukey par yatraaon ke kaaran charchaa main rahete hai
 Also active for cleanliness and avidity of Narmada
 narmada ke kinare paudharopan, jal sangrakshan tathaa swatchta ke vishyon par kaam karne ke liye inhen sammanit kiya gaya he
 Come from Dindori
 yahaan unka ashram bhi he
 He has many supporters in Mahakaushal area of madhya Pradesh
 indore ke yogendra mahant congress or bijepi ke aalaa netaaon ke saath dikhte the
 The Narmada scam against the government was the convener of the Rath Yatra
 vishwa brahman samaaj sangh ke rashtriya adhyaksh bhi hai
 They claim to have been working in the religious, social and educational fields for 35 years
 paudhe kahaan gaye
 The real report will be received only when the reporters will take stock of the Narmada side plants on which the state government has spent several crores of rupees
 patrika akhbaar ne madhyapradesh ke katni se report chhaapi he
 Look at the headline of this news - recently the world record has been erased, this situation has happened due to ignoring the officers
 katni kii khabar he ye
 Planters were appointed in each panchayat and Gramnagar to look after each plant
 kuch paudh rakshakon ko training bhi di gai
 But no one is aware of his appointment
 paudhon ke namonishaan nahin he
 The magazine was reported after five and a half months of the campaign had passed
 patrika kii hi ek khabar he hoshangabad kii
 This is the news of 23 March
 likhaa he ki pichley saal 2 july ko sohagpur blaak main das se adhik narmada ghaaton par paudharopan ko lekar afasaron or sanghathanon ne vaahvahee to lut lee magar in paudhon ko koi bachaane nahin aa rahaa he
 Employees believe that only fifty per cent of the 2
5 lakh plants planted in the block have flourished
 paudharopan kii safalataa 50 fisadi se ghatakar 20 se 25 fisadi tak hi rah jaaegi
 Plants have dried up after planting trees in Harda and Narsinghpur
 harda kaa handiya gaanv narmada ke kinare he
 Here the plants have dried up and there are also some leftovers
 narsinghpur zile ke bermaan gaanv main das hazaar paudhe lagane kaa daawa kiya gaya magar ab yahaan paudhe nahin bache hai
 Are only nominal
 shaq hota he ki jo baba paudharopan ke ghapale ko ujagar karne ke liye yatra nikaalane vaale the, unhen rajyamantri kya isliye banaaya gaya ki ve chup ho jaaen
 Religion be silent
 hamaari raajnneeti ab aisi hi hoti ja rahi he
 Build a monastery in your village, mps will not come in the village, they will definitely come to the monastery, then they will surround it and ask
 karnataka ke lingayat math main rahul gandhi bhi ja rahe hai, amit shah bhi ja rahe hai
 No matter how many people point towards this weakness of politics, when the election comes, there is less talk of work, Math, Baba, Mazar, Maulvi
 koi ganga kaa avatar ho jaataa he to koi shiv kaa pujari
 In my opinion, it is necessary to go everywhere but if it is going to vote, it is done to eliminate the public by diverting attention from public questions
 ye jo aapane kahani dekhi, wo raajnneeti kii nahin, aapke khatm hone kii kahani he
 The leader knows this, just you do not know
 ye bharat kii raajnneeti he
 Where is the public here
 
 
 janata har din laachaar hokar media ko khoj rahi he, media ne janata ko khojna band kar diya he
 The comments pashchim bengal main kuch chaatr rajya chayan ayog ke saamne binar lekar khadey hai
 Neither Baba nor any cleric nor your leader comes for them? a student has written that students are staging a protest in front of the WBPSC Office in Kolkata
 press ko bulaayaa gaya magar koi nahin aayaa
 The Junior Engineer examination was held in 2016 for civil and mechanical engineers
 civil kii list main 1356 chaatro kaa naam aayaa or inamen se 1082 ko posting de di gai
 But 274 students are still waiting for joining
 chaatra ne bataaya ki samasya to bahuton kii he magar apane hi haq ke liye 30-35 log hi aae hai
 When the public is no longer the public, it seeks refuge through something other than the public in politics, then it becomes its condition
 media ke liye bhi ye janata nahin he
 You are free to be happy when Baba is made a minister
 aap ab madhyapradesh main vriksharopan ke bare main kuch-kuch jaan gaye hai
 Many activists spend their lives in a party honestly
 har chunaav main taras kar rah jate hai ki tikat milegaa or ve bhi pratinidhitiv kaa mauka paa sakenge, unhen bhi satta sukh milegaa, aise kaaryakartaaon ko kaisaa lagata hoga
 It was good to spend twenty-two years in a party, that they would become Baba and from any party to the post of Parliament to Minister of State
 agar aap raajnneeti main kaaryakartaaon ke mahatv ko samajhate hai to is tarah se bhi dekh sakate hai ki paanch nishthavan kaaryakartaaon kii mahatvakanjhaaon ko thokar markar paanch baabaaon ko rajyamantri kaa darja diya gaya he
 Now the workers do not even question, do not protest, then what is happening to them is happening right away
 kya pataa unhen isamen kuch galat hi na lagata ho
 The reason is also strange
 narmada kinare ke kshetron main vriksharopan, jal sangrakshan or swatchta ke vishay par jan jaagrukta abhiyaan chalaane ke liye ek cameti bani he
 All these are included in the same
 uske baad rajyamantri kaa darja de diya gaya
 One of them is Computer Baba who announced that he is about to take out the Narmada Scam Rath Yatra to bring corruption in the work of Narmada Bachao
 ab ve rajyamantri ban gaye hai
 First, we quickly tackle political statements and then come to the real point
 prabhaat jha ne kaha ki sant ko hi mantri banaaya he, daaku ko nahin
 There is usually a framework of an argument
 is tarah se baton ko pesh kiya jaataa he jisase aapako lage ki baba ke rajyamantri banane kaa virodh karnaa, dharm kaa virodh karnaa he
 Then an immediate example will be given that a cleric was also given the status of Minister of State in the government of such and such
 jaise upi main tawqir raza khan ko rajyamantri kaa darja diya gaya tha
 Even then, there would have been criticism, it would have been said that there is appeasement
 baba ko rajyamantri kaa darja diya janaa kya he
 Today's wrong is being described as correct with the help of earlier wrong
 ek khabar bijness standard main chhapi thi
 This news dated May 29, 2013 states that Tauqeer Raza was appointed as consultant to the handloom textile industry department at KUP
 unhen rajyamantri kaa darja diya gaya
 The Bharatiya Janata Party then opposed it
 khabar ke anusaar shripati singh or capi singh ko bhi rajyamantri kaa darja diya gaya tha magar bhaajapa ne ittehad e millat council ke adhyaksh tawqir raza kaan ko rajyamantri kaa darja die jane kaa virodh kiya tha
 The then Governor met BL Joshi
 sapa sarkaar se nirnay badalawaane kaa aagrah kiya tha
 BJP state president Laxmikant Vajpayee met the governor with a delegation
 kaha tha ki yah alpsankhyak tushtikaran he
 Inspired by politics
 agar tawqir raza ko rajyamantri kaa darja diya janaa alpsankhyak tushtikaran he to paanch baabaaon ko rajyamantri kaa darja diya janaa koun sa tushtikaran he
 You can think on this point
 ab aate hai computer baba par
 Baba in the name
 fasebuk par ek profile he, sankat mochan sant shri ke naam se he
 There are many videos related to computer Baba on it
 isi main ek video 8 march ko post kiya gaya he jisamen baba narmada ke kinare ped lagane ke naam par hue ghotaale kaa pardaafash karne ke liye ek april se yatra nikaalnaa chaahate hai
 Photo journalist Raj Patidar drew our attention towards this video
 raaj patidaar 20 saal se photo patrakarita kar rahe hai
 Currently associated with Reuters
 ek poster bhi bana he jisamen likhaa he ki 45 zilon kii pantalis divasiy yatra nikalne ja rahi he
 In this, the entire Sadhu Sant Samaj is going to take out the Narmada Scam Rath Yatra
 iskaa netritv computer baba kar rahe the or sanyojak the pandit yoge mahant
 The poster said that according to the Chief Minister, 6 crore saplings were planted, which is not known anywhere
 is bade vriksharopan kii jaanch kar doshiyon ko sazaa di jaae
 Illegal mining in the Narmada River was immediately stopped
 har panchayat main gaushala kaa nirmaan kiya jaae or uskaa sangrakshan sadhu-santon ko diya jaae
 Immediately solved all the problems of the Math temples of the state jaae
 There are nine points in this poster in total
 ek april se lekar 15 may tak chalane vaali yatra kya rajyamantri ke pad ke laalach se badal gai
 The Baba people who were accusing the scam, were saying that the Chief Minister's claim of planting 6 crore saplings is false, he takes the position of Minister of State from the same Chief Minister, this leads to loss of the credibility of politics or these babas who use religion The learning of it falls
 press ne khub poocha ki aap to narmada ghotaale kaa aarope laga rahe the, ab mantri ban gaye
 You can decide how legitimate it is to make Baba's minister of state
 kya inke virodh ko rokane ke liye rajyamantri banaaya gaya
 Did these babas become ministers to prevent the scandal of plantation along the banks of the Narmada? ab to tivi main reporting kam hoti he varanaa paanch report paanch ghante ke bheetar shoot kar bataa sakate the ki 6 karod paudhe jo lagaae the unki kya haalat he
 At the moment, you will see a debate on this subject on TV, but you will never know the truth, because the debate will now start with examples like opposition on Hindu Baba being made a minister and silence on making Maulvi the minister
 aap yah kabhi nahin jaan paaenge ki 6 karod ped kahaan gaye
 On 19 July 2017, our colleague Anurag Dwari filed a report
 mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne narmada seva yatra shuru kii thi, uske liye bharat hi nahin, videshi akhabaaron main bhi vigyaapan die gaye the
 The state government spent 33 crore 7 lakh 40 thousand and 344 rupees on this advertisement
 vidhansabha main puche gaye ek sawaal ke jawaab main sarkaar ne hi yah jaankaree di thi
 Due to this visit, TV channels received 13 crore 23 lakhs in the form of advertisements and newspapers received 10 crore 77 lakhs
 aapako pataa hoga ki madhyapradesh main 11 disambar 2016 se 15 may 2017 ke bich namaami devi narmade seva yatra nikaali gai thi
 15 lakh rupees was spent every day on just traveling
 tab sarkaar ne kaha tha ki 33 karod kii rakam zyaada nahin he
 On July 2 last year, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan set a target of planting 6 crore trees
 vishwa ricard banane kaa lakshya tha
 Preparations were done for which Bakayaka was trained
 iske baad bhi haalat ye he ki iskaa ghotaalaa ujagar karne kaa elaan kuch baba karte hai or unhen mantri bana diya jaataa he
 It is not a matter of religion and faith, but to cover the question, who are searching for 60 million plants
 computer baba apane bare main daawa karte hai ki unka dimag computer jaisaa he
 Take a laptop with you
 indore ke ahilyanagar main inkaa bhavy ashram he
 Computer was not invented in India, but it was Baba who later became the Minister of State
 isaki bhavishyanavi nestrodamas yaa steve job yaa bill gates ne nahin kii thi
 His real name is Uday Deshmukh
 ye aksar maharashtra or madhyapradesh ke rasukhdaar logon ke saath dikhte hai
 Shaan and Shaukat are his identity
 
 
 hameshaa gadiyon kaa kafila saath chalata he
 Bhagyuji Maharaj is counted among the saints politically, his father has been a Congress leader in Maharashtra
 anna hajaare ke bhrashtachar virdohi andolan ke dauraan inkaa naam charchaa main aayaa tha jab anna hajaare ko manaane ke liye upie sarkaar ne inase sampark kiya tha
 Narmadananda Maharaj remains in discussion due to visits on the occasion of Hanuman Jayanti and Ram Navami
 narmada kii safai or aviralata ke liye bhi sakriy rahete hai
 He has been honored for working on the subjects of plantation, water conservation and sanitation along the banks of the Narmada
 dindori se aate hai
 There is also his ashram here
 madhyapradesh ke mahakaushal ilaake main unke kaaphi samarthak hai
 Yogendra Mahant of Indore was seen with top leaders of Congress and BJP
 sarkaar ke khilaaf narmada ghotaalaa rath yatra ke sanyojak the
 He is also the National President of the World Brahmin Society
 ve daawa karte hai ki 35 saal se dharmik, saamaajik or shaikshanik kshetra main kaam kar rahe hai
 Where did the plants go? isaki asli report to tabhi milegi jab samvaadadaata narmada kinare paudhon kaa gauge lenge jis par rajya sarkaar ne kai karod rupee kharch kiye hai
 The magazine newspaper has published a report from Katni in Madhya Pradesh
 is khabar kii hedline dekhie - haal hi main bane world ricard kaa mitaa naamo nishaan, afasaron kii andekhi se ho gaya ye haal
 This is news of harvest prayek paudhe kii dekhbhaal ke liye prayek panchayat or gramnagar main paudh rakshakon kii niyukti kii gai
 Some plant guards were also given training
 lekin unki niyukti kii jaankaree kisi ko nahin he
 The plants are not labeled
 abhiyaan ke saadhe paanch maheene biit jane ke baad patrika ne khabar kii thi
 One news of the magazine is from Hoshangabad
 yah isi 23 march kii khabar he
 It is written that on July 2 last year, officers and organizations looted accolades for planting saplings on more than ten Narmada Ghats in Sohagpur block, but no one is coming to save these plants
 karmchaaree maanate hai ki blaak main lagaae gaye dhai lakh paudhon main se pachaas fisadi hi punap paae hai
 The success of plantation will be reduced from 50 percent to only 20 to 25 percent
 harda or narsinghpur main vriksharopan ke baad paudhe suukh gaye hai
 Handia village of Harda is on the banks of Narmada
 yahaan kahin paudhe suukh gaye hai kahin-kahin bache bhi hue hai
 It was claimed to plant ten thousand saplings in Barman village of Narsinghpur district but now there are no saplings left
 naam maatr ke hi hai
 It is suspected that Baba, who was about to take a trip to uncover the plantation scandal, was made the Minister of State so that he could be silenced
 dharm chup ho jaae
 Our politics is becoming like this now
 apane gaanv main ek math banavaa lijie, gaanv main saansad to nahin aaenge, math main zarur aaenge phir vahaan gherkar puuchhiega
 Rahul Gandhi is going to Lingayat Math in Karnataka, Amit Shah is also going
 raajnneeti kii is kamazori kii taraf na jane kitne log ishaara karte hai phir bhi jab chunaav aata he to kaam kii baat kam, math, baba, mazaar, maulavee hone lagata he
 Some become incarnations of Ganga and some become priests of Shiva
 meri raay main janaa to chahie har jagah magar wo agar vot ke liye jaaya ja rahaa he, janata ke sawaalon se dhyaan hataakar janata ko khatm karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 This story you saw, it is a story of your end, not of politics
 netaa ko yah baat pataa he, bas aapako pataa nahin chal paata he
 This is the politics of India
 janata kahaan hai yahaan he
 
 
 The public is searching for the media every day, the media has stopped searching the public
 tippaniyan In West Bengal, some students are carrying banners in front of the State Selection Commission
 inke liye na to koi baba aata he na koi maulavee na koi aapkaa netaa? ek chaatra ne likhaa he ki kolkata main WBPSC Office ke saamne chaatr dharna de rahe hai
 The press was called but no one came
 2016 main junior ejeeniyar kii pariksha hui, civil or mekenekil ejiniyaron ke liye
 1356 students appeared in the civil list and out of these 1082 were given postings
 magar 274 chaatr abhi bhi jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 The student said that the problem is of many, but only 30-35 people have come for their own rights
 janata jab janata nahin rah jaati, vah raajnneeti main janata ke alaava kuch or hokar panaah maangati he to uski ye haalat ho jaati he
 It is not public for the media either
 aap swatantra hai baabaaon ke mantri banaae jane par khush hone ke liye
 You have now come to know something about tree plantation in Madhya Pradesh
 kaaran bhi ajeeb he
 a committee has been formed to conduct a public awareness campaign on the subject of tree plantation, water conservation and sanitation in the Narmada banks
 in sabhi ko usee main shaamil kiya gaya he
 After that the status of Minister of State was given
 inamen se ek hai computer baba jinhone elaan kiya tha ki ve narmada bachaao ke kaam main bhrashtachar ko saamne laane ke liye narmada ghotaalaa rath yatra nikaalane vaale hai
 Now he has become the Minister of State
 pehle raajnneetik bayanon ko jaldi se nipta dete hai phir aate hai asli baat par
 Prabhat Jha said that the saint is the minister and not the bandit
 aam taur par ek tark kaa ek dhaancha hota he
 In this way, things are presented so that you feel that opposing Baba's appointment as Minister of State is against religion
 phir turant udhaaharan diya jayega ki falaan kii sarkaar main kisi maulavee ko bhi rajyamantri kaa darja diya gaya tha
 Like Tauqir Raza Khan was given the status of Minister of State in UP
 us vakt bhi aalochana hui hi hogi, kaha gaya hoga ki tushtikaran he
 What is the status of Minister of State to Baba? pehle ke galat ke sahare aaj ke galat ko sahi bataaya ja rahaa he
 a news was published in Business Standard
 29 may 2013 kii yah khabar bataati he kiyupi main tawqir raza ko hathakargha vastra udyog vibhaag ke salaahkaar ke rup main niyukt kiya gaya
 He was given the rank of Minister of State
 tab bhartiya janata party ne iskaa virodh kiya tha
 According to the news, Shripati Singh and KP Singh were also given the status of Minister of State but the BJP had opposed the grant of Minister of State status to Tauqeer Raza Khan, President of ittehad-e-millat Council
 tab ke rajyapal biel joshi se mulaakaat kii thi
 The SP had requested the government to change the decision
 bhaajapa ke pradesh adhyaksh lakshmikant vaajapeyi pratinidhi mandal lekar rajyapal se mili the
 It was said that this is minority appeasement
 raajnneeti se prerit he
 If the status of Minister of State to Tauqir Raza is minority appeasement, then what is the satisfaction of giving five Babas the status of Minister of State? is bindu par aap soch sakate hai
 Now come to the computer Baba
 baba ne naam par
 There is a profile on Facebook, named Sankat Mochan Sant Shri
 is par computer baba se sambandhit kai video hai
 In this, a video has been posted on 8 March in which Baba wants to take out the yatra from April 1 to expose the scam in the name of planting trees along the banks of Narmada
 is video kii taraf photo jarnlist raaj patidaar ne hamaara dhyaan dilaayaa
 Raj Patidar has been doing photo journalism for 20 years
 is vakt riter se jude hai
 a poster has also been written which states that a forty-five day journey of 45 districts is going to leave
 isamen sampurna sadhu sant samaaj narmada ghotaalaa rath yatra nikaalane ja rahe hai
 It was headed by Computer Baba and Convenor was Pandit Yogha Mahant
 poster main kaha gaya he ki mukhyamantri ke anusaar 6 karod paudhon kaa ropan hua jiskaa kahin koi namonishaan nahin he
 The culprits should be punished by checking this large plantation
 narmada nadi main ho rahe avaidh utkhanan par turant roak lage
 Gaushala should be constructed in every panchayat and its protection should be given to sages and saints
 pradesh ke math mandiron kii sabhi samasyaon kaa turant niraakaran kiya Go kul milakar nau bindu hai is poster main
 Did the yatra, which ran from April 1 to May 15, change with the greed of the post of Minister of State
 jo baba log ghotaale kaa aarope laga rahe the, kah rahe the ki mukhyamantri kaa 6 karod paudhe lagane kaa daawa jhootha he, wo usee mukhyamantri se rajyamantri kaa pad le lete hai, isse raajnneeti kii saakh girti he yaa dharm kaa istemaal karne vaale in baabaaon kii sikh girti he
 The press asked a lot that you were alleging the Narmada scam, now you have become a minister
 aap tay kar sakate hai ki baabaaon kaa rajyamantri bananaa kitna jaays he
 Was the Minister of State made to stop their opposition
 kya narmada ke kinare vriksharopan ke ghotaale ko saamne aane se rokane ke liye in baabaaon ko mantri banaaya gaya
 Now the reporting in TV is less or else five reports could be shot within five hours and tell what is the condition of the 6 crore saplings that were planted
 philhal aap tivi par isi vishay par dibet to dekhenge magar sachai kabhi nahin jaan paaenge kyonki bahes ab hindu baba ke mantri banaae jane par virodh or maulavee wo mantri banane par chuppi jaise udaahranon ko lekar hone lagegi
 You will never know where the 6 crore trees went
 19 july 2017 ko hamaare sahyogi anuraag dwari ne ek report file kii thi
 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan started the Narmada Seva Yatra, advertisements were given for him not only in India but also in foreign newspapers
 is vigyaapan par rajya sarkaar ne 33 karod 7 lakh 40 hazaar or 344 rupee kharch kiye the
 The government gave this information in response to a question asked in the assembly
 is yatra ke kaaran tivi channelon ko vigyaapan ke rup main 13 karod 23 lakh mili the or akhabaaron ko 10 karod 77 lakh
 You will know that Namami Devi Narmade Seva Yatra was taken out in Madhya Pradesh from 11 December 2016 to 15 May 2017
 har din yatra par sirf prachaar prasar par 15 lakh rupee kharch hue the
 Then the government said that the amount of 33 crores is not much
 pichley saal 2 july ko mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne 6 karod vriksh lagane kaa lakshya rakhaa tha
 The goal was to create a world record
 jiske liye bakaayaka prashikshan diya gaya, taiyaari kii gai
 Even after this, the condition is that some Baba declares to expose the scam and he is made a minister
 maamla dharm or aasthaa kaa nahin he, us sawaal par pardaa daalane kaa he, jo 6 karod paudhon kii khoj kar rahe hai
 Computer Baba claims about himself that his mind is like a computer
 apane saath laptaap lekar ghoomte hai
 He has a grand ashram in Ahilyanagar, Indore
 bharat main computer kaa avishkaar nahin hua, magar is naam se baba hue jo aage chal kar rajyamantri bane
 It was not predicted by Nesthrodamus or Steve Jobs or Bill Gates
 inkaa asli naam he udai deshmukh
 They are often seen with the influential people of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh
 shaan or shaukat inaki pahchaan he

 No matter how many people point towards this weakness of politics, when the election comes, there is less talk of work, Math, Baba, Mazar, Maulvi

 In my opinion, it is necessary to go everywhere but if it is going to vote, it is done to eliminate the public by diverting attention from public questions
 ye jo aapane kahani dekhi, wo raajnneeti kii nahin, aapke khatm hone kii kahani he
 The leader knows this, just you do not know

 The comments pashchim bengal main kuch chaatr rajya chayan ayog ke saamne binar lekar khadey hai
 Neither Baba nor any cleric nor your leader comes for them? a student has written that students are staging a protest in front of the WBPSC Office in Kolkata
 press ko bulaayaa gaya magar koi nahin aayaa
 The Junior Engineer examination was held in 2016 for civil and mechanical engineers

 You are free to be happy when Baba is made a minister
 aap ab madhyapradesh main vriksharopan ke bare main kuch-kuch jaan gaye hai
 Prabhat Jha said that the saint is the minister and not the bandit
 aam taur par ek tark kaa ek dhaancha hota he
 In this way, things are presented so that you feel that opposing Baba's appointment as Minister of State is against religion
 phir turant udhaaharan diya jayega ki falaan kii sarkaar main kisi maulavee ko bhi rajyamantri kaa darja diya gaya tha
 Like Tauqir Raza Khan was given the status of Minister of State in UP
 us vakt bhi aalochana hui hi hogi, kaha gaya hoga ki tushtikaran he
 What is the status of Minister of State to Baba? pehle ke galat ke sahare aaj ke galat ko sahi bataaya ja rahaa he
 a news was published in Business Standard
 29 may 2013 kii yah khabar bataati he kiyupi main tawqir raza ko hathakargha vastra udyog vibhaag ke salaahkaar ke rup main niyukt kiya gaya
 He was given the rank of Minister of State
 tab bhartiya janata party ne iskaa virodh kiya tha
 According to the news, Shripati Singh and KP Singh were also given the status of Minister of State but the BJP had opposed the grant of Minister of State status to Tauqeer Raza Khan, President of ittehad-e-millat Council
 tab ke rajyapal biel joshi se mulaakaat kii thi
 The SP had requested the government to change the decision
 bhaajapa ke pradesh adhyaksh lakshmikant vaajapeyi pratinidhi mandal lekar rajyapal se mili the
 It was said that this is minority appeasement
 raajnneeti se prerit he
 If the status of Minister of State to Tauqir Raza is minority appeasement, then what is the satisfaction of giving five Babas the status of Minister of State? is bindu par aap soch sakate hai
 Now come to the computer Baba
 baba ne naam par
 There is a profile on Facebook, named Sankat Mochan Sant Shri
 is par computer baba se sambandhit kai video hai
 In this, a video has been posted on 8 March in which Baba wants to take out the yatra from April 1 to expose the scam in the name of planting trees along the banks of Narmada
 is video kii taraf photo jarnlist raaj patidaar ne hamaara dhyaan dilaayaa
 Raj Patidar has been doing photo journalism for 20 years
 is vakt riter se jude hai
 a poster has also been written which states that a forty-five day journey of 45 districts is going to leave
 isamen sampurna sadhu sant samaaj narmada ghotaalaa rath yatra nikaalane ja rahe hai
 It was headed by Computer Baba and Convenor was Pandit Yogha Mahant
 poster main kaha gaya he ki mukhyamantri ke anusaar 6 karod paudhon kaa ropan hua jiskaa kahin koi namonishaan nahin he
 The culprits should be punished by checking this large plantation
 narmada nadi main ho rahe avaidh utkhanan par turant roak lage
 Gaushala should be constructed in every panchayat and its protection should be given to sages and saints
 pradesh ke math mandiron kii sabhi samasyaon kaa turant niraakaran kiya Go kul milakar nau bindu hai is poster main
 Did the yatra, which ran from April 1 to May 15, change with the greed of the post of Minister of State
 jo baba log ghotaale kaa aarope laga rahe the, kah rahe the ki mukhyamantri kaa 6 karod paudhe lagane kaa daawa jhootha he, wo usee mukhyamantri se rajyamantri kaa pad le lete hai, isse raajnneeti kii saakh girti he yaa dharm kaa istemaal karne vaale in baabaaon kii sikh girti he
 The press asked a lot that you were alleging the Narmada scam, now you have become a minister
 aap tay kar sakate hai ki baabaaon kaa rajyamantri bananaa kitna jaays he
 Was the Minister of State made to stop their opposition
 kya narmada ke kinare vriksharopan ke ghotaale ko saamne aane se rokane ke liye in baabaaon ko mantri banaaya gaya
 Now the reporting in TV is less or else five reports could be shot within five hours and tell what is the condition of the 6 crore saplings that were planted
 philhal aap tivi par isi vishay par dibet to dekhenge magar sachai kabhi nahin jaan paaenge kyonki bahes ab hindu baba ke mantri banaae jane par virodh or maulavee wo mantri banane par chuppi jaise udaahranon ko lekar hone lagegi
 You will never know where the 6 crore trees went

 The government gave this information in response to a question asked in the assembly

 You will know that Namami Devi Narmade Seva Yatra was taken out in Madhya Pradesh from 11 December 2016 to 15 May 2017

 Then the government said that the amount of 33 crores is not much

 The goal was to create a world record
 jiske liye bakaayaka prashikshan diya gaya, taiyaari kii gai
 Even after this, the condition is that some Baba declares to expose the scam and he is made a minister
 maamla dharm or aasthaa kaa nahin he, us sawaal par pardaa daalane kaa he, jo 6 karod paudhon kii khoj kar rahe hai
 Computer Baba claims about himself that his mind is like a computer

 Illegal mining in the Narmada River was immediately stopped
 har panchayat main gaushala kaa nirmaan kiya jaae or uskaa sangrakshan sadhu-santon ko diya jaae
 Immediately solved all the problems of the Math temples of the state jaae
 There are nine points in this poster in total

 The Baba people who were accusing the scam, were saying that the Chief Minister's claim of planting 6 crore saplings is false, he takes the position of Minister of State from the same Chief Minister, this leads to loss of the credibility of politics or these babas who use religion The learning of it falls

 The government gave this information in response to a question asked in the assembly
 is yatra ke kaaran tivi channelon ko vigyaapan ke rup main 13 karod 23 lakh mili the or akhabaaron ko 10 karod 77 lakh
 You will know that Namami Devi Narmade Seva Yatra was taken out in Madhya Pradesh from 11 December 2016 to 15 May 2017
 har din yatra par sirf prachaar prasar par 15 lakh rupee kharch hue the
 Then the government said that the amount of 33 crores is not much

 The goal was to create a world record

 In the historic election in Britain, voters have given Prime Minister Boris Johnson a 'powerful new mandate'
 unki conservative party ko shuukravaar ko sansad main nirnaayak bahumat mila taaki vah agle maheene europea sangh (iyu) se britain ke alag hone ke qaraar (bracit) ko antim rup de saken
 The 55-year-old Johnson, who campaigned intensely with the simple slogan 'brexit Hoga', has given the Conservative Party a majority since Margaret Thatcher in 1980
 jeet ke baad unhone sankalp liya ki matadaataaon ke vishwaas par khara utarane ke liye ‘din-raat' kaam karenge
 Sky News reported that the Conservative Party won 365 seats in the 650-member House of Commons, the 650-member House of the British Parliament, 79 seats more than the majority
 saint ive seat ke nattejey sabase aakhir main ghoshit kiye gaye or is seat par conservative party ne 80 maton se jeet darj kii
 In Britain, 67 per cent of voters exercised their franchise in decades of winter polling
 vijayi raily ko sambodhit karte hue johnson ne ise bracit ko lekar jari gatirodh ke liye ‘nayi subah qaraar' diya or daawa kiya ki vah matadaataaon kii ore se jataae gaye ‘pavitra vishwaas' ko khandit nahin hone denge
 Earlier Johnson himself won from Uxbridge and South Ruislip in London
 conservative party ke netaa ne kaha ki majboot nayaa janadesh 31 janvari ko 28 sadasyeey aarthik samooh europea sangh (iyu) se alag hone ke raste par badhane ke liye mila he
 Troubled by the long-standing deadlock over the issue of Brexit, voters are believed to have given Johnson a huge mandate so that by January he can separate Britain from the EU and there will be no agony
 unhone kaha, ‘‘aisa lagata he ki ek rashtriya conservative sarkaar ko bracit karne ke liye majboot nayaa janadesh diya gaya he
 This is not only for Brexit but also for uniting and taking the country forward
 ''vijay raily main apni mahila mitra kairi symond or paaltu kute dilayen ke saath maujuud johnson ne kaha, ‘‘hamane kar dikhaaya, hamane use gira diya, hamane gatirodh ko khatm kar diya, hamane bandishen tod deen, hamane raste ke avarodhon ko khatm kar diya
 While giving a winning speech filled with vigor, he said, "we believe that with this election we have eliminated all the dangers of the second referendum
" ''is dauraan unhone logon se ‘bracit hoga' ke baar-baar naare lagavaaye
 Johnson went to Buckingham Palace to meet Queen Elizabeth II and formally sought permission to form a new government
 is chunaav main vipakshi lebar party ko keval 203 siten mili hai
 This is the party's worst performance since decades, after which party leader Jeremy Corbyn announced his resignation
 corbin ne kaha, ‘‘ yah lebar party ke liye niraash karne vaali raat he
 
 
 i will not lead the party in any future general elections
 ''ullekhneey he ki 70 varshiya lebar netaa swayan ladann ke islington north seat se jeet darj karne main kaamyaab hue hai
 The defeat is attributed to Corbyn's leadership, his inability to take a clear stand on Brexit, and his inability to properly respond to accusations of increasing Jewish opposition within the party
 kashmir main antarrashtriya hastkshep kii maang karne vaale prastaav paarit karne ke baad party kii kathith bharat virdohi chhavi bani or mana ja rahaa he ki paaramparik rup se lebar party ke saath rahe bhartiya mul ke matadaataaon kaa moh bhang hua
 Soon after Johnson was re-elected by an overwhelming majority, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated him
 modi ne twit kiya, ‘‘main unhen apni shubhakamanaayen detaa hum or bharat-britain sambandhon ko or pragadh karne ke liye milakar kaam karne kaa icchhuk hum
 The Conservative Party also made gains in areas previously considered to be the strongholds of the Labor Party
 lebar party ko uttari england, midland or wales ilaakon main haar mili jahaan par 2016 ke janamat sangrah main europea sangh chhodane ke paksh main matdaan kiya gaya tha
 Reacting to the exit poll, Priti Patel, who was a minister in Johnson's previous government, said, "this election was hard fought in the coldest days of the year because we needed a majority of the Conservative Party to work
" '' unhone kaha, ‘‘ham apni praathamiktaaon ko puri karne or bracit ko praathamikta ke aadhaar par karne ko lekar patibaddh hai
 The agreement is in front and we want to move forward on that
 ''yah 1935 ke baad lebar party kii sabase karaari haar he
 The party has also lost in northern England and voters seem to have voted on the issue of Breguit
 lebar party kii ore se vitt mantri pratyaashee jon macdonelle ne kaha, ‘‘bracit chunaav par haaavee rahaa
 The results will be very disappointing if the exit poll remains
 ''gauratlab he ki johnson ne conservative party ko bahumat dilaane or bregsit ko lekar house of comons main gatirodh todane kii kavayad ke tahat madhyavadhi chunaav kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 This is Britain's first general election in December in nearly a century, and voters voted out of their homes in the chilling cold
 paanch saal main teesri baar or 2016 main europea sangh se alag hone ke mudde par janamat sangrah hone ke baad duusari baar britain main aam chunaav hue hai
 Johnson, who took power from Theresa May earlier this year, had a Brexit deadline until October 31, but faced hurdles due to not having a majority in the House of Commons
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan johnson ne ‘bracit karenge' mudde par lagaataar dhyaan kendrit kiya
 He promised voters that Britain would secede from the European Union by 31 January 2020 if they got a majority
 iske vipareet vipakshi or pradhanmantri pad ke prabal daavedaar lebar party ke netaa corbin ne bracit or europea sangh main bane rahane par phir se vichaar karne ke liye doosraa janamat sangrah karaane kaa vaada kiya tha
 Meanwhile, the European Union (EU) Internal Markets Commissioner Thierry Breton said the organization would have to reestablish its relations with London
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ham jaanate hai ki britain ke saath sambandhon ko dobaaraa sthapit karnaa hoga jo mahatvapurn saajhedaar he
 Breton said the EU wants a balanced trade relationship with Britain
 unhone ummid jataai ki shuukravaar ko brussels main hone vaali europea parishad kii baithak main iyu ke mukhya vaartakar maaikel barnear ko landan se baatcheet ke liye nae adhikaar die jaaenge
 Breton said the eu's social and environmental standards in future trade agreements will also be implemented in trade with Britain
 johnson kii jeet par rus ne kaha ki vah hameshaa ummid karata he ki chunaav main un shaktiyon ko aawaaj milegi jo achche sambandh ke himachati hai lekin britain main cajumrvetive party ko lekar nishchit nahin he
 Reacting to Johnson's victory, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, "I don't know how true such expectations about the Conservatives are

 In relation to this slogan, he said that the slogan does not mean that all the youth will get their life partner today but it is an effort to draw attention of political parties towards the problem
 jagalan kehete hai ki 'aap' party ko chhodkar sabhi pramukh dalon ke ummidavaar vot maangane ke liye hamaare gaanv main aa chuke hai lekin kisi ne bhi hamaari is maang ke bare main ek shabd nahin kaha

 In 2009, a group of youths took out a rally on the issue of female feticide, but the rally could not achieve the desired results and no one noticed it

 Now if there is 'adulteration' in it
 
 
 unka sangharsh kareeb 3 maheene se chal rahaa tha
 In May, Olympic medalist Sushil Kumar began demanding trials for the Rio Olympics in the 74 kg weight category, while Narsingh Yadav won a "quota" for India by winning a bronze medal at the World Championships in Las Vegas in September last year
 olympic ke niyamanusaar "kota" desh ke liye jeeta jaataa he
 If the sports association of the country wishes, it can conduct a re-trial for the Olympics so that the best in-form athlete goes to the Olympics, but usually the athlete who gets the quota goes
 susheel kumaar trial main hissaa anfit hone ke kaaran nahin le paae the yaa shaayad iske peeche bhi koi kahani thi, ye shaayad kabhi saamne nahin aa paae
 However, Dangal went to Delhi High Court to go to Rio
 6 june ko faisalaa narsingh yadav ke paksh main aayaa
 But the story was not going to end here, because there was still drama, emotion and conspiracy
 25 june or 5 july ko NADA ne narsingh yadav par do dope test kiye
 On July 23, the news became public that Narasimha Yadav was found positive in both tests
 rio main padak ke daavedaar maane jane vaale pahalwaan narsingh yadav ke liye maanon duniya khatm ho gai
 When Narsingh Yadav got up, he realized that he had fallen victim to a big conspiracy
 narsingh par aarope laga unhone METHANDIENONE kaa seven kiya he
 But there was a flaw in this conspiracy
 darasal METHANDIENONE ek enabolic streroid he jo masals banane main kaam aata he
 Whereas before Rio, Narasimha had to lose about 8 kg
 narsingh ke vakil yahi daleel dete rahe ki narsingh vajan badhaane vaala drugs kyon legaa

 Amit Malviya shared a dialogue of the 2017 film 'indu Sarkar' in this 7 second video
 isamen party ko nehru-gandhi parivaar ke bich simate rahane ko lekar nishaanaa saadhaa gaya he
 Let me tell you that party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala of the meeting of the Congress Working Committee for nearly 11 hours said that there was a wide discussion about the President in the meeting of the Congress Working Committee
 sarvasammati se teen prastaav paarit kiye gaye
 First, the Congress Working Committee thanked Rahul Gandhi for his leadership
 unhone har kshan party kii seva kii
 Become the voice of every section of the society
 rahul gandhi ne desh main bhay or hinsa ke vaataavaran ke khilaaf nirantar aawaaj uthaai
 Gave new energy and new direction to the party
 ek nirnaayak ladaai ladi
 The Working Committee expressed confidence in the leadership of Rahul Gandhi and said that the party will continue to support them
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne mangalvaar ko narendra modi par paroksh hamalaa karte hue kaha ki vipakshi netaa sirf lambey-chaude vaade karte hai or amiron ke liye kaam karte hai, jabaki unki party garibon ke saath khadi hoti he or unhen unke sapanom ko saakaar banane main madad karne main yakeen rakhti he
 Addressing a public meeting in Baran town of Rajasthan, Rahul mentioned several steps of the UPA government such as the Food Security Bill, Land Acquisition Bill and MNREGA, which have been taken up for the uplift of the economically weaker sections
 tippaniyan Targeting indirectly at bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, Rahul Gandhi said, "people come and make big claims
" ham lambey-chaude daawey karne main yakeen nahin karte
 We work ham chaahate hai ki aapke bachche bade sapane dekhen
 If you are not able to dream, then this country cannot grow even further

 Rahul said, when it comes to schemes for the poor, those people ask where the money will come from
 parantu jab khadaanen aavantit hoti hai or jameenon kaa adhigrahan hota he, to koi sawaal nahin poochta
 This is the difference between these parties and the Congress

 We want your children to dream big
 agar aap sapane nahin dekh paaenge, to yah desh aage bhi nahin bad saktaa
 He attacked these parties in passing the Food Security Bill and citing the opposition's opposition to MNREGA and said that these political parties only work for the rich
 rahul ne kaha, jab garibon ke liye yojanaon kii baat hoti he, to ve log poochhate hai ki paisa kahaan se aayega
 But when mines are allotted and land is acquired, no one asks
 yahi in dalon or congress ke bich antar he
 Targeting indirectly at bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, Rahul Gandhi said, "people come and make big claims
" ham lambey-chaude daawey karne main yakeen nahin karte
 We work ham chaahate hai ki aapke bachche bade sapane dekhen

 i speak sanju film kii relies ke baad se hi sanjay dutt kii jindagi ke kai nae pahalu darshakon ko dekhne or padhane ko mil rahe hai
 There are many strange and unheard-of incidents related to Sanju's life one after the other
 drugs kii lat or bheekh maangane jaise daur se gujarey sanjay dutt kii jindagi main wo vakt bhi aayaa jab unpar homosexuality tak kaa iljaam lagaaya gaya
 Sanjay Dutt has become religious by staying in jail? Used to do these things when Sanjay Dutt's career was on the verge of drowning due to drug addiction and he was sent for treatment in Rehab in America
 jab sanjay dutt vaapis laute to unke ajij dost or unke jija kumaar gaurav ne unki kaaphi madad kii
 Actually, Kumar Gaurav's father Rajendra Kumar cast Sanju in his film 'naam'
 ye film kaaphi hit rahi or is film se sanju kaa kariyar phir patari par aa gaya
 During this, Sanju and Kumar Gaurav's friendship also became very deep
 unki dosti ke charche is kadar chhaae hue the ki saal 1986 main unke afaire hone kii khabaren aane lageen
 Sanjay Dutt, emotional after watching 'sanju', kept crying for 20 minutes after such news that Sanjay Dutt himself had to break the silence to tell the truth of this in the interview
 sanjay dutt ne stardst magazine ko die intervyuu main kaha, 'meraa or kumaar kaa relationships bilkul normal he
 Those who have a dirty mind also take this friendship in a dirty way
 agar aapkaa ishaara homosexuality kii taraf he to ye galat he
 In this interview, Sanjay Dutt further said - Mera and Kumar have a healthy relationship, such relationships are rarely seen in the film industry
 bataa den ek aisa daur bhi aayaa jab kumaar gaurav or sanjay dutt kii dosti main daraar aa gai
 The reason for this rift was none other than Sanjay Dutt's wife Manyata Dutt
 saal 2008 main jab sanjay dutt ne manyata se shaadi rachaa lee to is baat ke liye naa sirf sanjay kii bahane namrata or priya naaraaz thim balki kumaar gaurav bhi khaase naaraaz the
 But later this conflict also disappeared

 haryana vidhansabha chunaav main purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ne khud ko siem candidet ghoshit karne kii maang congress haikaman se kii he
 According to sources, while Hooda is adamant on declaring himself as the Chief Ministerial candidate and is seeking to contest the Assembly elections under his leadership, he also wants a position in the organization for his son Dipendra Hooda
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne haalanki isapar abhi koi faisla nahin liya he
 Senior party leaders met at 10 Janpath, the residence of Congress President Sonia Gandhi, to prepare for the election
 isamen pradesh ke prabharee gulam nabi aaazaad, bhupendra singh hooda sahit tamaam party netaa shaamil hue
 There is a continuous phase of anger over the Congress leadership in Haryana and there is a tussle between former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Ashok Tanwar
 purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ne haal hi main rohtak main mahaparivartan raily karke congress hai kaman ko apni siyaasi takat se waakif karaayaa tha
 He has given a clear indication from the rally that Ashok Tanwar should be removed from the post of State Congress President and he should be given an important role in the upcoming assembly elections
 hooda kii sharton ko lekar congress haikaman kashmakash main he
 In fact, the current Congress state president of Haryana Ashok Tanwar was appointed by Rahul Gandhi
 aise main agar tanvar ko pradesh adhyaksh pad se hataaya jaataa he to yah sandesh jayega ki sonia gandhi ke raaj main rahul ke karibiyon ko tavajjo nahin mil rahi he
 The biggest challenge before Sonia Gandhi is to end Haryana's tug of war without making Team Rahul angry
 congress alaakaman pradeshdhyaksh ko badalane par faisla le saktaa he
 It is also being speculated that Kumari Selja may be given the command of the party in place of Ashok Tanwar on the post of state president
 haalanki ashok tanvar saaf kah rahe hai ki haryana congress main koi badlaav nahin hoga
 There is no discussion of leadership change yet
 tanvar ne kaha ki netritv parivartan kii charchaa pichley paanch saal se chal rahi he, jisko ronaa he wo rota rahe
 The party seems to be lagging behind in the assembly election race due to a mutual dispute of the Congress
 abhi tak congress kii koi taiyaari nahin dikh rahi he, jabaki bhaajapa teji se prachaar abhiyaan chalaae hue he
 Eventually, the Alibag bungalow of the absconding diamond trader Nirav Modi was demolished for several months

 Nirav Modi had permission to build a bungalow on a 376 square meter plot in Alibag area, but he laid siege to 1081 square meters of space
 ab sarkaar dwaara is avaidh nirmaan ko dhahaaya ja rahaa he
 The demolition of Nirav Modi's bungalow was stopped in January because the administration wanted to remove the valuables from inside the house properly so that the maximum amount could be recovered from the property of the bungalow

 somvaar ko anjana om kashyap ne sonia ko guide kiya or unhen nagaland jawaab diya
 On the advice of Anjana, Sonia won 12 lakh 50 thousand rupees
 kebisi kaa pehla din kaaphi masti majaak ke bich beetaa
 Amitabh asked Sonya- "we have heard that your husband is Bengali and you are Haryana
 to ghar main sara hisaab to ulta chalata hoga? ye sunakar sonia hans padi or unhone kaha, "sar
 
 
 Now kitchen is my department after being retired

 At the same time, we Haryana people like milk

 unhone bataaya, "hamaare yahaan haryana main jab baraat aati he to swaagat main duulhe ko doodh kaa ek gilaas pilaate hai
 This procession happened in my procession too, but the whole procession could not even drink half a glass of milk
 sab ek-duusare ko doodh kaa gilaas badhaate rahe ki koi to ise pi sake
 " maharashtra ke chandrapur main police ne baadh peediton par jamkar lathi charge kiya
 While charging sticks on the flood victims, the police crossed all limits and lathi blindly
 police ne na to auraton or bujurgon ko baksha na hi bacchon ko
 Not only this, the police also beat people up and beat them up
 logon kaa gunaah sirf itnaa tha ki unhone palak mantri ko gher liya tha
 However, there are reports that the minister's car was stoned
 pichley ek maheene main chauthi baar baadh kii maar jhel rahe baadh peediton ne chandrapur daure par baadh peediton kaa haal jaanane aae mantri sanjay devtale ko gher liya or unke khilaaf narebaaji karne lage
 After this, the police got angry and lathi-charged him fiercely
 logon ke mutabik prashasan se kisi prakaar kii koi madad nahin milane or shahar main ghus rahe baadh ke pani kii rokthaam nahin karne ke kaaran logon main naaraaji charam par he
 In such a situation, the Minister of Palak also did not take any care of the increasing victims, so the anger of the people was inflamed on the Minister and people threw stones at the Minister's car
 police ne saat logon ko hiraasat main bhi liya he
 After all, how will the government improve the condition of the workers? After all, how will those working in the unorganized sector get the right attention for their work? How will the basic needs of workers' bread, cloth and houses be met? These are some of the burning questions that always put governments in the dock
 darasal, bharat main asangathit kshetra ke kamgaaron ke bare main ab tak koi sateek anumaan or aankade hai hi nahin, jabaki mana jaataa he ki asangathit kshetra main kaam karne waalon kii sankhya kul kamgaaron kaa 85% he
 Apart from this, there are many such sensitive theories about this manpower, which have to be interpreted in the same way, as even today clearly we do not know who are the workers according to the government rule
 Definitions of their salary, organized sector, unorganized sector, small enterprise, medium enterprise etc
 are not fixed
 isaki vajah se shram sudhaar ke tahat vastusthiti kaa pataa lagaana, nitiyaan or yojanaayen bananaa mushkil kaam he
 In 2017, when the debate on unemployment was going on in the country, the NITI Aayog commented that this debate is 'happening in the air' because the estimates that are available are either outdated or based on surveys that have flaws
 
 isaki vajah se puure desh main rojgaar kii asli tasviir kaa pataa nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 Since then, the situation has not changed much but the debate has come on reform of labor laws instead of unemployment
 chaunkaane vaali paribhaashaenniti ayog ke ek tosk force kii report kahati he ki praasangik or sateek aankade isliye maujuud nahin hai kyonki kamgaaron ke liye istemaal hone paribhaashaon main samanta nahin he
 For example, in India, definitions are not fixed for organized workers, so many definitions are used
 jo sabase saamaanya paribhaasha he vah factries act 1948 ke tahat register udhyamon main kaam kar rahe logon par lagu hoti hai ki ve sangathit (formal) kaamgaar hai
 However, the NSSO in its survey writes them as Organized instead of Formal
 is paribhaasha ke tahat seva kshetra main kaam karne vaale sabhi kaamgaar asangathit (informal’ or ‘unorganised) kaamgaar kehlaayenge
 Apart from this, the Ministry of Labor and Employment uses the second definition for the classification of workers
 aise udhyam jisamen 10 yaa zyada varkar hon or sabhi sarkaar karmchaariyon ko mantralay sangathit (formal) kaamgaar maanata he
 The term 'organized' is also used in this definition along with 'formal'
 ek anya paribhaasha main aise kamgaaron ko 'formal' kaha gaya he jo contact par hon, bhale hi udhyam kaa aakaar kaisaa bhi ho
 This definition makes a distinction between 'formal' and 'organic', but is contradictory in the Indian context
 report kahati he ki yah sari paribhaashaayen “badi baadhak hai or inhone tamaam sthaayee naukariyaan karne vaale kamgaaron ko gananaa se baahar kar detii hai, kyonki ve kisi bade udhyam main kaam nahin kar rahe hai yaa phir unke paas likhit anubandh nahin hai
 After considering all the options, the task force concluded that a new and viable definition is needed for data on organized sector workers
 nai samhita main bhi khamiyaan hansarkaar 44 kendriya kanoonon ko chaar samhitaon main sametane kii koshish kar rahi he
 These four codes will be labor related, industry matters, social security and professional safety, health and working conditions
 haalanki, samasya phir bhi bani hui he
 For example, in the Industrial Relations Code of 2017, 'unorganized' worker means a domestic worker, self-employed or a worker working in the unorganized sector
 isamen use bhi shaamil kiya gaya he jo orgenised sector main kaam to karata he lekin anorgenised workars soshal security act of 2008 main likhit chah kanoonon ke daayre se baahar he
 But the definition of 'unorganized' in the Social Security Code of 2018 states that (a) a worker (whether it is a domestic worker, doing his or her job, being a worker with an employer, or a paid worker) in the unorganized sector (B) a person who works in a place where there is no written contract
 nai samhitaon main bhi 'varkar' yani kamgaaron ko lekar yahi sthiti he
 There are several definitions in these, the use of different words loosely
 aresas se jude kamgaaron ke sanghathan bhartiya majdoor sangh ke adhyaksh sike sajinarayan kehete hai ki chaaron samhitaon main istemaal sabhi vyakhyaaon ke ek tulanaatmak adhyayan kii aavashyaktaa he taaki inamen saralata or ekarupata laai ja sake
 According to him, every man is a worker who provides his labor to anyone
 lekin jatilta is had tak he ki akele soshal security code of 2018 main 144 paribhaashaayen hai
 On the positive side of this, Sajinarayan says that there are many unorganized workers who are involved in domestic labor, home delivery buoys, small scale production jobs for multinational companies, contract workers, etc
 are also included in the new code
 asli chunauti yah he ki unhen bhi aupchaarik vyavastha ke tahat le aayaa jaae or unhen bhi kanoonee suraksha mili
 PC Monahan, who was chairman of the National Statistical Commission, says the complexity of definitions is because India's economy has developed differently from European countries
 yahaan zyaadaatar log swarozgaar main lage hai (jaise kheti karnaa, bartan bananaa, lakdi ke saamaan bananaa aadi) jise aam taur par femily bijness kaha jaataa he
 It was recorded in the census of 1930 and 1940
 'orgenised' shabd sabase pehle unke liye aayaa jin kamgaaron ko kanoonee rup se suraksha mili hui thi
 Later, the term 'formal' came into vogue for the government and organized sector
 'informal' shabd unke liye istemaal hone laga jo krishi or vibhinn sevaaon main kaam karte hai
 According to Mohanan, it is still very difficult to define 'work' and 'worker' in the Indian context
 international lebar orgenigeshan ne haal main paribhaasha di he ki aisi koi bhi gatividhi jo jidipi kii gananaa main yogadan detii ho, vah 'aarthik gatividhi' maani jaaegi or aisa karne vaala 'varkar' mana jayega
 It will not be enough just to improve the status of scientific data collection by different principles and definitions of words
 balki badlaav tab aayega jab yah sunishchit kiya jaae ki bade paimaane par labhaarthiyon ko nai samhita ke tahat suraksha mili
 Sajinarayana says that the data gathering process has to be made scientific and comprehensive so that those whose workers are not even counted will also get the benefit
 iske liye ek naye tantra kii jarurat he jo yah sunishchit kare ki sabhi kamgaaron ko iskaa laabh mili
 MS Unnikrishnan, chairman of the CII National Committee on Industrial Relations, says the current figures are inadequate

 The court ordered that the coal extracted from these coal mines would not be sent for commercial use until the next decision

 In a country where even legendary spinners like Shane Warne had to contend, Australia's Adam Jampa is proving impressive

 vahiin, agar tulana kii jaae to bharat ke leg spinner yujavendra chahal ko mohali main khele gaye chauthe match main maar padi thi
 Chahal had taken just one wicket for 80 runs in 10 overs
 is match ke baad kai cricket panditon ne chahal kii aalochana kii thi, lekin srilanka ke purv diggaj spinner muthaiya muralidharan ne chahal kii pairvi karte hue unhen champion bataaya he or kaha he ki vah sirf insaan hai, robot nahin
 Muralitharan told IANS, 'you cannot expect a player to take five wickets every time he plays a match
 vah champion gendbaaj hai or beete do saal se acchhee gendbaaji kar rahe hai
 He has told that he has diversity and he can upset the opposition batsman
 yah sirf ek match main unke vifal hone kii baat he
 Believe it, they are not robots
 aap ek khilaadi se har match main behatar pradarshan karne kii ummid kar us par dabaav nahin daal sakate
 Former India spinner Erapalli Prasanna has also reiterated Muralitharan's saying that a match does not change anything
 unhone kaha, 'chahal ne kitne match khele hai- lagbhag 50 (41)? kya aap mujhase kah rahe hai ki unhone apane desh ke liye itane vanade aise hi khel liye? hamen unke saath dhairya rakhana hoga
 i think Australia players have become good leg-spin batsmen over the years
 chahal ke paas yogyata he or unhone is baat ko sabit bhi kiya he
 "jampa has performed better than Chahal," former off-spinner Prasanna retorted, asking, "jampa took wickets, only because Chahal was questioned
" 
 The i don't think this is correct, as he has played just one match in this series

 'ajtak' ke saath hui khaas baatcheet main sandip dikshit ne kaha, "ghatiya harakat kar rahe hai maakan
 What is happening in Delhi is very unfortunate
 " aapako bataa den ki dikshit philhal maharashtra main hai jis vajah se unase is masale par vistaar se baat nahin ho pai
 On one hand, Sandeep got angry with Maken on the other hand, on the other hand, appealed to Congressmen who were leaving the party before the MCD elections not to join BJP
 sandip ne kaha, "bhale hi dilli congress ke adhyaksh ajay maakan ghatiya harakat kar rahaa ho lekin meri party ke sabhi logon se apil he ki wo party naa choden, bijepi main naa jaaen varanaa meri unase sahanubhuti nahin rah jaaegi
 "for the purpose of alerting the Congress high command, Sandeep said," Delhi Pradesh is acting like a business house

 If the high command did not pay attention, then it seems that Delhi too has started on the path of Uttarakhand

 While the Congress has started encircling the state government on this issue and trying to make it anti-farmer, the government is accusing the Congress of making false statements

 The reason for this is that if the Congress succeeds in its efforts, the government's claims of being farmer-friendly are bound to be discounted

 lekin chunaav ayog kaa kahana he ki uskaa daawa galat he or use kul 44 vot mili hai

 But according to the Election Commission, Sirsat got a total of 44 votes
 tippaniyan Maharashtra Election Commission Public Relations Officer Jagdish More said that Srikanth Sirsat's name is in two booths and in one he got 11 votes and in the other got 2 votes
 donon main se ek main unka apana vot hona swaabhaavik he
 Jagdish More also made it clear that even in the complaint made by Srikanth Sirsat, he wrote about the disturbances in the EVM and not to get a single vote
 sawaal he phir shrikant ne media main jhootha bayaan kyon diya? Srikanth Sirsat, who has been avoiding the media since the claim of getting zero votes, appeared in front of the media on Friday and said that immediately after the counting of votes, our people told that all the booths are getting zero votes, even one in my booth Did not get votes
 isliye maine tab wo bayaan jari kiya tha
 But now the truth is in front of everyone
 chunaav ayog ke khulaase ke baad shrikant ab bhale hi unhen ek bhi vot nahin milane kii baat se peeche hat gaye hon lekin iviem se chhedchhad kii apni baat par wo ab bhi kaayam hai

 Shivanand Tiwari, an old ally of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and former MP, is away from active politics
 lekin samay-samay par bayaan dete rahete hai
 Shivanand Tiwari is a veteran leader of Bihar
 wo rajd main lalu yadav ke saath or jadyu main nitish kumaar ke saath rah chuke hai
 Both are also said to be close
 bihar ke jane-maane patrkaar shrikant ne apni kitaab 'bihar chitthiyon kii raajnneeti' menshivanand tiwarike bare main likhaa ki wo lalu or nitish ke bich pendulum kii tarah dolate rahe
 These days Shivanand Tiwari is quite active on social media Facebook
 fasebuk par hi unhone nitish kumaar ke naam ek lambii chitti likhi he
 Citing the reason for writing the letter, Shivanand Tiwari has written, 'this letter reached his hand on the evening of July 15
 iske pehle 13 july ko nitish se milane kaa samay maanga tha
 Due to lack of time, he had to resort to the letter to convey his point to them
 iske baad bhi do baar milane kaa samay maanga lekin samay nahin mila he
 Nitish's 'zero tolerance' against corruption is a hypocrisy
 lalu se gathbandhan hi iskaa pramaan he
 Actually, Nitish is again looking for a way to go with the BJP on the pretext of this hypocrisy because he feels' comfortable 'there!' In his letter, Shivanand Tiwari called Nitish Kumar the only strong face against Narendra Modi and BJP is
 or saath hi yah bhi joda he ki agar bihar main gathbandhan tutaa to bijepi or sangh kaa agenda puure desh main failega
 He writes, 'today my prediction seems to be successful but the BJP does not want to see your face against Narendra Modi
 bihar chunaav main ek virdohi ke rup main tumhaari kshamta or pratibha vah dekh chuki he, isliye har tarah kaa taal-tikadam laga kar vah isko asafal karnaa chaahati he
 In all these cases the capacity of the RSS is tremendous
 kuch apwaad ko chhodkar media aankh band kar modi kaa samarthan kar rahaa he
 Everyone is vigorously pursuing life behind how the Bihar alliance collapses soon
 'jaankaar maanate hai ki shivanand tiwari ek majhe hue netaa hai or unka is tarah se nitish par hamalaa bolnaa yaa apane patr main gathbandhan tuutane ke nuksaan ginane kaa matlab he ki vaaki nitish kumaar bihar main lalu yadav or unke parivaar ke saath asahaj hai or wo jald hi bihar main gathbandhan ko lekar koi faisla le sakate hai

 If combined with the results of the 2013 assembly elections, it seems that Rajasthan is maturing in a democratic way
 isse mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke kandhe par is maamle main jimmedaari kaaphi bad gai he
 Prime Minister is Narendra Modi and he will keep an eye on his performance to make the state as good as Gujarat has become
 ucch padasth sutron kaa kahana he ki bhrashtachar ke badastoor jari rahane se raaje bahut khafa hai or kuch aise adhikariyon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai karne kii taiyaari kar rahi hai, jinhen congress sarkaar main kaaphi prashray mila tha
 Those officers have also been kept in office in the BJP government
 raaje ne aashwast kiya tha ki kisi ke khilaaf bhi badale kii karrwai nahin kii jaaegi
 However, Raje is happy with the way the administration works during the Lok Sabha elections
 adhikariyon ne adarsh aachaar samhita ke bheetar rahakar acchhee tarah se kaam kiya
 This led to the Election Commission not taking any action against any officer
 mukhya sachiv rajeev maharishi ne mukhyamantri karyaalay se puri tarah talmail banaakar yah sunishchit kiya ki prashasan na to aadchan banegaa or na hi kisi tarah ke rajnatik khel main shaamil hoga
 The Chief Electoral Officer of the state, Ashok Jain, has once again succeeded in holding fair elections in the state
 raaje afasarshahi main ulatpher kar sakati hai taaki adchanon ko or kam kiya jaae
 It is a common belief in the bureaucracy that most of the officers who get good postings belong to the same lobby, c
 ke
 Matthew had prepared
 raaje apane sutron se mili is tarah kii jaankariyon ko bhi gambhirtha se le rahi hai ki acchhee posting chaahane vaale adhikariyon main kuch mukhya sachiv yaa mukhyamantri karyaalay ke aadesh kii avhelnaa kar rahe hai
 They are trying to plant news in the media against the officials on whom Vasundhara Raje depends
 yah to hui shashan kii baat, lekin rajnatik rup se dekhen to bhi loksabhaa ke nateezon se ek nae yug kii shuruyaat ho rahi he
 The effect of this will be seen on those ministers like Prabhu Lal Saini, who failed to give a strong candidate like Raje's son Dushyant Singh an edge in their constituency
 vasudev devnani jaise kuch bujurg netaaon ke achche din aa sakate hai, jinhen mantrimandal gathan main nazarandaaj kiya gaya tha
 The people of Devnani region voted overwhelmingly in favor of Sanwar Lal Jat to defeat state Congress President Sachin Pilot
 duusari taraf, unuus khan ko jawaab dena padegaa ki aakhir barmer main musalamaanon ne badi sankhya main baagi netaa jaswant singh ko vot kyon diya or nagaur main bijepi kii jeet bahut kam antar se kyon hui? haalanki, musalamaanon ne kisi ek party ko vot nahin diya he or aisa lagata he ki kuch ne bijepi ko bhi vot diya he
 Now the reorganization of the cabinet also looks strong as Raje has got complete independence
 raaje kii ore se pehali baar mantrimandal kaa gathan aupchaarikta hi thi
 But this time, definitely she would like to bring such ministers who can work
 unhen ek majboot kor team banani hogi
 Ministers like Gulab Chand Kataria, who have created a completely uncomfortable situation by opposing the control of gravel prices in their area, do not improve
 raaje ab teji se kaam karnaa chaah rahi hai
 She is going to make changes in labor laws, land acquisition laws
 ve rajya kii viraasat evam paryaton ko bhi teji se aage badhaane kii koshish bhi karengi
 Her immediate priority will be to tackle the list of stuck tasks that she can complete thanks to her good contacts with Modi
 isliye achraj kii baat nahin agar rajya ko metro ke liye vishesh fund hasil ho jaae

 The doctors told me that i would have to undergo key hole surgery

 When i gave birth to the child after three months, my pain disappeared
 jesica ke mutabik, 'delivery ke vakt tak bhi mujhe nahin pataa tha ki main pregnent hum
 i went to the toilet two or three times that day
 mujhe halkaa-halkaa dard ho rahaa tha, lekin mujhe laga ki period vaala dard he
 My mother came to see me whether i was well or not and realized that something was wrong
 maine 15 minute tak push kiya or beti meri paidaa ho gai

 jabaki isse pehle isi saal bharat or pakistan ke bich enese stareey vaarta radd kar di gai thi, kyonki donon pakshon ke bich baithak ke agenda par sahmati nahin ban pai thi

 The Ayodhya Ram temple dispute is currently going on in the Supreme Court
 lekin ayodhya main sarayu nadi ke kinare bhagwaan ram kii pratimaa lagane ke liye adhigrahit kii gai bhoomi bhi vivaadon main aa gai he
 This land was acquired by Yogi Adityanath Sarkar
 prashasan ke jameen adhigrahan ke tareeke ko lekar 64 bhoomi maalikon ne elahabaad hoicourt kii lakhanu bench kaa darwaja khatkhataya he, jahaan unki yachika ko sweekaar kar liya gaya he
 For this, the High Court has set a date for the administration officials and land owners to appear on July 25 to present their case
 uttar pradesh kii yogi sarkaar ne ayodhya main sarayu ke kinare vishwa kii sabase oonchi bhagwaan ram kii pratimaa banavaane kii ghoshnaa kii thi taaki ayodhya se guzarane vaale har shaks ko ram ke darshan ho saken
 For this, the dispute has arisen as soon as the Ayodhya district administration takes the process of land acquisition
 64 jameen ke maalikon ne bhoomi adhigrahan ko lekar sawaal khadey kar die hai or maamalon ke saath court pahunch gaye hai
 Landowners say that there is no objection to the installation of the idol of Ram, but the administration is constantly misleading them
 unka aarope he ki ukt bhoomi kaa samuchit muaavja bhi nahin diya gaya
 In such a situation, they gathered the straw and made their house
 ab vah kahaan jaaen
 He said that Lord Ram would never want anyone to be destroyed and harmed
 yachikakarta avadhesh singh ne kaha, bhagwaan ram kii murti kii sthapana ke liye yogi sarkaar ne ghoshnaa kii
 We were happy with this
 lekin yah nahin maaloom tha ki ham logon ko ujaad kar murti kaa nirmaan hoga
 The accountant and the administration continued to mislead us
 isliye ham logon ko court kii sharan main janaa padaa, kyonki ye log muaavje ke bare main nahin bataa rahe hai
 Rather want to forcibly take the land
 unhone kaha, ham log ram virdohi nahin hai, ram bhakt hai
 It is not that we do not want to give land
 lekin ham logon ko uchit muaavja diya jaae
 That is why we have gone to the court so that the court will ask the administration whether they are paying compensation or not
 yachikakarta kehete hai ki bhagwaan ram kii sabase oonchi pratimaa lagane kii ghoshnaa se ham log bahut khush hue the
 It was felt that Ayodhya would develop in a new way
 baad main pataa chalaa ki ham logon kii coloniyon ko ujaad kar murti kaa nirmaan hoga
 Even after this, we were ready
 lekin jila prashasan hamen gumraah karata rahaa
 We also held 12-point demands after meeting with the Collector on the 14th
 prashasan ne kaha tha ki market rate, cirkil rate yaa registry rate ke jariye muaavja diya jayega
 On this, we said that we wanted compensation at the market rate, to which he did not give many answers
 ek anya yachikakarta ranjana shukla ne kaha ki survey hua to hamen pataa chalaa ki kisi kaa naam aayaa kisi kaa nahin
 After this, again, the survey has not been completed yet, after which surveys were conducted several times
 iske baad ham logon ne apni-apni aapatti daakhil kii, lekin dm ne kaha ki jameen na dene kii baat mat kariye, jameen to ham le hi lenge
 After this, we have come to the court
 isi tarah mamata gupta bhi uchit muaavje kii maang kar rahi hai
 At the same time, Ayodhya's saints and saints are angry due to the controversy over the idol of Lord Rama
 unka kahana he ki ram mandir ko lekar abhi koi faisla aayaa nahin or ram ke naam par ek or vivaad ko janm de diya gaya
 This is not only an attempt to forcibly drag Ram into controversies but also the dignity of Ayodhya is being hurt
 iske liye prashasan amala hi nahin balki khud sarkaar bhi jimmedaar he
 Ramlala's chief priest Acharya Satyendra Das said that Lord Ram is only like a vote bank for the BJP
 ramalala ke naam par satta main ai, lekin ram tirpal main hai
 After that said that we will install a statue of Ram Lala, a huge statue, but now that case went to the High Court
 is prakaar bijepi keval ayodhya main ramalala ko vivaadit bana rahi he
 a dispute was not even concluded that the second land acquisition dispute had reached the High Court
 manhat paramhans kehete hai, yah bahut dukhad he ki bhagwaan ram kii pratimaa lagaae jane kaa maamla court pahunchaa he
 We want to request Yogi Adityanath that you choose a land that is undisturbed
 aise main agar aapako ayodhya main koi jameen nahin mil rahi he to tapasvi chhavnee kii jameen haive se lagi hui he
 a statue of Lord Rama should be installed there
 iske badale hamen kuch nahin chahie, ham log bahut vivaad jhel chuke hai or ab kisi nae vivaad main nahin padana chaahate hai

 Senior Congress leader Sam Pitroda has apologized for the uproar over the 1984 Sikh riots
 sam pitroda ne kaha ki meri hindi kharaab he, main 'jo hua wo bura hua' kahana chahta tha

 Sam Pitroda said that we have other issues to discuss what the BJP government did and gave

 Taking a dig at the BJP, the Congress said that we took action against the accused in the Sikh riots, while the BJP gave ticket to Sadhvi Pragya Thakur, accused of the Malegaon bomb blasts
 Agony of the entire Sikh community
 Suffering of all those Sikh families killed by Congress leaders in 1984
 Attack on Delhi’s secular ethos

 Facing a serious political crisis over the decision to allow foreign direct investment (FDI) in the retail business, the government has begun to unite its allies before accepting the opposition's adjournment motion to break the parliamentary deadlock
 niyam ke anusaar sthagan prastaav par charchaa ke baad matdaan kaa praavdhaan he
 Parliament's proceedings were interrupted for the eighth consecutive day due to the deadlock over FDI
 sutron ne bataaya ki sansadeey gatirodh samaapt karaane ke liye sarkaar ne apane prayaas tej kar die hai
 At the same time, the government is also working on the strength of the mps so that if there is a division of the house under the adjournment motion, it should have a majority of mps to defend their decision
 sutron ke mutabik yadi aisa hota he to sansad main kaamkaaj agle saptaah se shuru ho saktaa he
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday held a meeting with Congress allies in the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government opposing FDI in retail

 The Lok Sabha has 18–18 mps from both parties

 It has two mps in the Lok Sabha

 Sources said that DMK has assured the government that it will demand some amendment in the decision but it will vote in favor of the government
 lekin trinmul congress ne apane ravaiye main badlaav nahin kiya he
 After the meeting with Manmohan Singh, Trinamool Congress leader Sudeep Bandopadhyay told reporters, 'our attitude has not changed
 ham charchaa chaahate hai lekin ham nahin chaahate hai ki sarkaar gire
 He refused to give details about the discussions with the Prime Minister
 sutron kaa kahana he ki sansadeey gatirodh ko samaapt karaane ke liye ek samjhaute kii ranneeti 'kareeb-kareeb bana lee gai' he
 The Trinamool Congress will continue to oppose the decision but it will not participate in voting
 aise main yadi trinmul congress matdaan se anupasthit rahati he or diemke sarkaar kaa saath detii he to khudara kaarobaar main mahatvapurn sudhaaron ke liye loksabhaa main saansadon kaa aankada sarkaar ke paksh main hoga
 Not only this, the government is also trying to bring the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) with them on this issue
 loksabhaa main sapa ke 22 saansad or basapa ke 21 saansad hai
 If both parties agree to stay away from it or boycott it during the voting, then the number of mps present and voting will be reduced
 yah sthiti sarkaar ko trinmul congress ke bina sthagan prastaav ko vifal karne main madad karegi
 The two-thirds majority figure in the House of 543 members of the Lok Sabha is 272 and the government can get the votes of 264 mps without Trinamool and DMK
 yadi sapa or basapa donon matdaan se anupasthit rahati hai athwa inamen se koi ek matdaan main hissaa nahin letaa he to prastaav ke virodh main matdaan kii sankhya nirnaayak rup se sarkaar ke paksh main aa jaaegi
 Since the vote on the adjournment motion is not like a motion of confidence and if the majority of mps in the voting under the adjournment motion is not in favor of the government, the government will not fall, but this defeat means it will have to withdraw its decision on FDI
 And it would be an embarrassing situation for the government

 The next meeting of the GST Council, the decision making body on Goods and Services Tax (GST), is to be held on July 21
 is baithak main prakritik gas or jet ful yani vimaan ke eendhan ko jiesti ke daayre main laane par faisla ho saktaa he

 aise main agar vimaan eendhan ko is tex slab main shaamil kiya jaataa he to rajyon ko rajasav kaa baari nuksaan hoga
 In such a situation, the Center may allow states to levy some additional VAT on aircraft fuel
 vahiin, prakritik gas ko GST ke daayre main laane par keemton main vruddhi ho sakati he
 Currently, the central government does not levy any excise duty on natural gas sold to industries, but excise duty on CNG is 14 per cent
 vahiin duusari ore rajya 20 fisadi tak waite lagaate hai
 Sources said if 12% GST is levied on natural gas, the states will suffer
 lekin agar 18 fisadi lagaaya jaataa he to bijli or urvarak ke utpaadan kii laagat main vruddhi hogi
 He said that taxation can be a problem for CNG

 "we did not do well in Bengaluru (when Yuzvendra Chahal took six wickets for 25 runs in February 2017)
 lekin, vah alag match tha, yah match alag tha
 Kuldeep took three wickets in four balls and caught us
 aisa nahin tha ki ham shot hawa main khel gaye hon
 He completely overshadowed us and i think he bowled well
 ’unhone kaha, ‘hamane paryaapt ran nahin banaae or sambhavat: hamane 30 se 40 ran kam banaae
 i think we had a great start
 kuldeep ne acchhee gendbaaji kii, lekin hamen pataa he ki ham uskaa saamana isse behatar kar sakate hai
 Before the next match, we have to assess our plan and make sure that the plan is right and we stick to it
 ’morgan ne apane ballebaajon se kaha ki vah jose butler se sabak len, jinhone spinneron kaa saamana kaaphi acchhee tarah kiya
 India completely dominated the match
 keel rahul ne 54 gend main naabad 101 ran kii pari khelkar bharat ko aasaan jeet dilaai
 a brilliant century, rooted in Rohit's club, KL rahulmorgan, however, feels that his team failed to capitalize on the difficult occasions
 unhone kaha, ‘unhone hamaare spinneron ko adhik maukey nahin die
 If we were able to cash in on the difficult occasions, the result of the match could have been different
 jaise kris jordan ne boundry par kaich choda yaa agar pari kii shuruyaat main rahul kaa point par kaich pakad liya jaataa
 So this match would have been completely different
