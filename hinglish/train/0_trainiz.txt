 Apart from this, Shilpa, who has always been helpful towards not only forgiving development but also towards the family, made the audience crazy due to this role
 yahi nahin jab shilpa ke khilaaf kai gharavaalon ne ek saath milakar kai aarope lagaae tabhi bhi unka shant atitude dikhne ko mila
 Even Benafsha, who was out of Bigg Boss 11, apologized to Shilpa for her behavior on Instagram
 Everytime Salman would joke around and say "ben jaa rahi hai", there was one person along with Priyank who would secretly cry
 However, the time i actually went out i hurt her so much that she did not even shed a tear
 Akash and Arshi weren't the only ones who called her Shilpa ma, throughout the journey we had a distant but lovely relationship, and i WISH so bad that i could take the last week back when i was mean to her
 i don't care about people hating and saying i completely changed sides after coming back, had i known how much you and Vikas looked out for me in the show, the wrong things would've never happened
 It takes a lot to apologise and accept mistakes, and i was in tears when i saw how much you cared
 Still wish i could come and just hug you and say sorry once, that would be enough redemption

 If there will be heavy rain in this season, where will this water go? Obviously, if the path is not found in the river, the water coming from above will enter the human areas itself

 That is, so much water used to flow easily from inside its banks, but if more than 70 thousand cusecs of water is released in these rivers in the last few years, then flood-like situation will arise in Punjab

 There is an outcry in Delhi onion and the government is still waiting for relief
 lekin lagata to yahi he ki dilli sarkaar kii chintaa bhi sirf dilli ke aansuon ko dekh ghadiyaali aansu hai
 Because the government selling cheap onion has closed its shops after seeing the onion prices

 The public distribution system, which is the victim of terrible mismanagement in the state and the rejuvenation of its cheap ration shops, has now started under his leadership
 raaje ne pehla saahasik kadam uthaate hue rashtriya khaadya suraksha kanoon, 2013 ke antargat sabsidiukt gehanr ke labhaarthiyon kii sankhya ko 1
 2 crore
 iske liye labhaarthiyon kii samiksha kii gai or un ayogy labhaarthiyon ko chhanta gaya jinhen ashok gahalot kii congressi sarkaar ne vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle jod diya tha
 Instead 20 lakh people have been added to the beneficiaries
 is kavayad se rajya ke khajaane ko 896 karod ru
 Has been saved
 raaje ke mutabik, ''ham chaahate hai ki har yogya naagarik apane liye tay ek-ek paise kaa hakdaar ho
 They should be sorted out who are getting this money in the wrong way and find ways to find those who are deprived of the scheme despite being deprived
 ''is samiksha main ek prashasnic adhikari ko bhi labhaarthi ke rup main darj paaya gaya
 The number of such people was found to be more than the population of six districts
 akele kiraasana ke maamle main alvar jile ke kotkasim main kiye gaye ek praayogic adhyayan ke chalate kul darj labhaarthiyon main se 94 fisadi ko chhaant diya gaya or rajya main kul 1
 Out of 56 crore beneficiaries, the names of 40 lakh were removed from the list

 According to him, after the digital card is ready by the end of this year, 20 lakh fake ration cards will be discharged
 in digital rashan cardon ko 25,000 saste rashan kii dukaanon par lagi point of cell (pioes) mashiinon se jod diya jayega, jinamein se 9,000 praayogic taur par karyrat hai
 Through this, beneficiary basis biometrics will be resorted to for issuing quota
 ise anya jagahon par bhi online kiya jayega or teen saal ke bheetar dealer ke yahaan bhi uplabdhta online hogi
 a section of dealers have protested against the initiative through sit-ins and have forced the government to back down on some proposals under which computer literate graduates were to be kept as dealers
 lekin raaje ne saste rashan kii dukaanon ke maamle main ek or pariyojna shuru kar di he
 She says, "we are trying to make them mini departmental stores instead of such small shops made in dark corners, giving only three grains and storing long queues, to increase the income of their owners and in the remote Consumers living can also get good products
 ''sarkaar is kaam main koi nivesh nahin kar rahi
 His role is only that of a mediator
 iske tahat 25,000 saste rashan kii dukaanon ko annapurna store naam diya jayega or yahaan daal, chaaval, sabun, rosemara ke saamaan samet 225 se 350 branded utpaada maujuud honge jo nijee retail dukaanon ko takkar de saken
 Bid for this has been called twice and Kishore Biyani's Future Consumer Enterprises has got the contract for 5,000 shops
 rajya kaa khaadya or naagarik aapurti nigam future kii aadhaar holcel trading and distribution ko madad de rahaa he taaki annapurna pariyojna ko safaltaapurvak lagu kiya ja sake
 Raje inaugurated the scheme on 31 October 2015, after reviewing the results of experiments conducted at half a dozen shops a year earlier
 ab tak 80 saste rashan kii dukaanon ko annapurna store main badla ja chukaa he or june tak ise 5,000 dukaanon tak vistaarit karne kaa lakshya he
 Ten Big Bazaar of Future Group exists in the state, which alone has Rs 35 crore in grocery business
 salanaa kaa turnover he
 Its owner Kishore Biyani aims to connect with consumers who have to travel a long way to buy quality products
 annapurna ke madhyam se saste galle ke retailleron kii kamai ko 7,000 ru
 If Raje's scheme of doubling from monthly is successful, Biyani will be able to get 20 times the business of Big Bazaar from 5,000 shops
 iske liye har paksh ko dhairya baratna hoga, kyonki rashan kii dukaanon ke maalik ekadhikaar ke aadi ho chuke hai or unamem vah kaushal nahin he ki ve kam aay vaale upabhoktaaon ko maal bech saken
 Most of these goods may be costlier than traditional shops but cheaper than Big Bazaar
 sarkaar retailleron ko protsaahit kar rahi he ki ve dukaanon ko sajaane-sanvaarane samet maal kii pehali khep hasil karne ke liye kareeb ek lakh ru
 Invest is par sawaal uth rahe hai ki aakhir ek sarkaar kisi ek kaarobaari gharaane ko iklauta aapurtikarta banane main madad kyon kar rahi he or saste rashan kii dukaanon ke maalikon kii, kahin se bhi sasta maal kharidne or bechney kii aazaadee kyon chin rahi he? agarwal kehete hai ki saste galle kii dukaanon ko sarkari dukaanon kii tarah dekha jaataa he, isliye yah rajya kii jimmedaari he ki vahaan ek nishchit gunvattta kaa maal bike or aisa ek hi vitarak ke madhyam se kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, they are in the unorganized sector, so they will not have enough resources and enterprise to go to different wholesalers and buy quality goods
 kuch retailor bikri ko lekar utsahit hai lekin kuch anya aise hai jinhen andeshaa he ki unki laagat nikalne main kaaphi vakt lag jayega
 Manish Pareek, in-charge and senior manager of Future Group, has made the job easier for Annapurna scheme retailers

 They pick up the leftover goods and replace them with fast-selling goods
 gaur talab he ki india today kii ore se kiye gaye adhyayan ke mutabik, rajasthan main jaipur ke irdagird 60 kilometre ke daayre main upabhoktaaon kii pasand kuch kilometre par badalati rahati he
 Raje inaugurated the Annapurna shop of 55-year-old Suresh Kumar Sharma in Bambhori village on 31 October
 yahaan 350 kism ke saamaan maujuud hai
 They are happy with the sale
 unki dukaan se upabhokta dav sabun kharid rahe hai
 Gaurikant, 40, of Phulera, says he cannot sell Annapurna products from the place where he used to sell kirasan and wheat, as there is a lot of smell and dust
 so unhone 100 gaj dur sthit apane nae makaan ke saamne vaale dalan ke kamare main annapurna store khol liya he
 However, he has not yet used the official color suggested for this
 phir bhi unki dukaan dudu block ke majumabad main bujurg ram nivas bairava kii tin shed vaali dukaan se kahin behatar he jahaan unhen isliye dukaan kholani padi kyonki makaan maalik annapurna kii dukaan ke liye zyada kiraaya maang rahaa tha
 Bairwa has 1,500 customers with many coming from far away places
 unamem se kuch hi annapurna ke utpaada kharidte hai or bairava ko unke daam bhi yaad nahin rahete kyonki unhen mili pehali suchi angreji main thi
 Apart from this, there is another Annapurna shop of Ram Narayan Chaudhary in the neighborhood due to which the sale of Bairwa is low
 choudhary kaa kahana he ki unhen aise graahakon ko aakarshith karne ke liye tambaakoo utpaada rakhane padate hai jo fere and lavali kii tub kii jagah uskaa saishe chaahate hai or gilette ke shaving brush kii jagah saste brush kii maang karte hai
 Most of Annapurna's shopkeepers demand that they should be given sugar as well but the government fears that rationing sugar may be sold in Annapurna, hence sugar is not being allowed to be sold in Annapurna
 rashmi devi kahati hai ki jaipur ke shivaji nagar main sthit annapurna kii dukaan se kuch saamaan kharidne main unhen aasaani hoti he jabaki kamala saini jaisi saste rashan kii upabhokta ko annapurna ke saamaan mahange lagate hai
 When the challenge is to live on a limited income, then the question of quality goes backwards
 raaje ko in siyaasi aaropon ko gambhirtha se lenaa hoga ki ve garibon ko mahangaa saamaan kyon bech rahi hai? biyani kaa maananaa he ki ve graahak annapurna store kaa swaagat karenge, jo gunvatttapurna utpaada khareednaa chaahate hai, par jiske liye unhen shahar janaa padataa he kyonki aise utpaada unke gaanv yaa kasbe main uplabdh nahin hai
 This work of Raje is quite big and difficult because carts have to make 1,200 trips from half a dozen warehouses to deliver goods to 5,000 shops every week
 rashan kii kai dukaan ke maalikon ke pariwaron ko bhi is kaam main joda ja rahaa he par sarkaar ko andeshaa he ki kai rashanvaale yaa to isamen aaenge nahin yaa phir chhod jaaenge
 That is why it has proposed to hire educated and interested candidates for cheap galleys and Annapurna shops
 khaadya or naagarik aapurti vibhaag 2017 tak 600 karod ru
 Expecting a turnover
 isamen se ek karod ru
 He will be able to spend on the promotion of the brand and the welfare of the retailers
 yah yojana bhi he ki jab dibbaband saamagree kaa daam chadhe to annapurna kii dukaanon se use saste main bechaa jaae
 Raje hopes that this distribution system promoted by the government will prove to be a metamorphosis in the retail market at the grassroots level
 par yah tabhi sambhav he jab biyani in graahakon kii aadaton ko badal sakenge
 Rajasthan seems to be at the forefront of such reforms or experiments in the public distribution sector
 ateet main chhattisgarh or karnataka rajya sarkaron ne upabhoktaaon ko saste galle kii chijen un dukaanon se bhi kharidne kii anumati di thi, jo unke liye panjikrut nahin thim
 Rajasthan will have to face the problem of net connectivity in implementing POS machine service in at least ten percent of the shops
 rajasthan iklauta rajya he jisane annapurna retail chen shuru kiya he
 Sooner or later amendments will also fix the age limit for ration card shop retailers
 aise dukandaar ke bacchon ko sidhe-sidhe in dukaanon kaa hastantaran nahin ho sakegaa
 It seems that these measures of pressure from the government will ensure that the owners of ration shops adopt the Annapurna scheme

 After Gilani's explanation, Akbar said, "there was a lack of dialogue that made this mistake
" asuvidha ke liye ham khed jataate hai
 Earlier, Akbar had said that this decision to withdraw the protest has been taken because it is expected that the administration may take stern action against the protesters
 akbar ne tab kaha tha, ‘baharhaal, ghati bhar main log apane ilaakon or apane gaanvon main virodh pradarshan karte rahenge
 Petitions and memorandums urging the army and other forces to leave the state on humanitarian grounds should be presented on social networking sites such as Facebook
 ’ullekhneey he ki gilaani ne kal kaha tha ki prastaavit virodh march shantipurna hoga or suraksha balon ke shiviron par hamalaa karne kii koi yojana nahin he

 hyderabad police ne guuruuvaar ko congress ke varisht netaa digvijay singh ke khilaaf aatankwaadi sanghathan islamic state (aies) kii farji website ke sambandh main kii gai tippanee ko lekar maamla darj kiya he
 Digvijay tweeted on May 1 that the Telangana police had created a fake website of the Islamic State (IS) to implicate Muslim youths
 telugana raashtra samiti (tiares) ke vidhayakaem
 The case has been registered against Digvijay at the Jubilee Hills police station on the complaint of Gopinath and another person

 Digvijay's statement came three days ago, but the police registered a case against him after seeking legal opinion
 digvijay ne twit kiya tha ki telugana police ne ek farji aies kii website banaai he, jo muslim yuvakon ko kattarpanthi bana rahi he or unhen aies main shaamil hone ke liye prerit kar rahi he
 Digvijay had said in the next tweet that the issue is that Telangana police should implicate Muslim youths to join IS by spreading inflammatory information? Is it fair? Is it ethical What Chief Minister chandrashekhar raav ne telugana police ko muslim yuvaaon ko aies main shaamil hone ke liye prerit karne or phir unhen fansaane kaa adhikaar de rakhaa he? agar unhone aisa kiya he, to kya unhen isaki jimmedaari nahin leni chahie or pad se istipha nahin de dena chahie? agar unhone aisa nahin kiya he to, unhen aisa jaghanya aparaadh karne waalon ke khilaaf jaanch kar unhen dandit nahin karnaa chahie?police ne bataaya ki agar jarurat padi to ve digvijay ko poochtacha ke liye bulaayenge

 Mafia don Munna Bajrangi was murdered in Baghpat jail due to enmity or is part of a conspiracy
 kya vaaki munna bajrangi kii hatya sunil rathi ne kii? kya hatya ke vakt sunil rathi ke alaava koi or shaamil tha? kya hatya kisi ke ishaare par kii gai? kya sarkari system ke kisi aadmi kaa hi he ye sara khel? ye saare sawaal munna bajrangi kii maut ke baad se hi sabake dimag main gum rahe hai
 Two photographs, many interiors but Aaj Tak's two photographs of Munna Bajrangi, drawn just after the murder, are found to be important clues in unraveling the mystery of this massacre
 ajtak ke haath lagi in donon tasveeron main ham jo saboot dikhaaenge wo aapkaa dimag hilaakar rakh degaa
 While the first picture is seen immediately after the murder, the second picture is much later
 hatya ke thik baad khinchi pehali tasviir main munna bajrangi jameen par padaa he or uske seene ke bichobich baniyaan ke upar se goli kaa nishaan dikh rahaa he
 In this picture the blood coming out of Munna Bajrangi's body looks absolutely fresh
 matlab saaf he ki yah tasviir goli maarane ke thik baad lee gai
 The tone of the blood on the body and on the floor is telling that fresh bullets have been killed
 is tasviir se yah bhi saaf he ki kisi ne baqayada laash ke paas khadey hokar yah tasviir khinchi he, vah bhi goliyaan lagane ke fouran baad
 At the same time, the second picture seems to be of some time after the murder of Munna Bajrangi, that is, some time has passed since Munna Bajrangi was shot
 saboot ke taur par sharir or jameen par bikhare khun kii rangath dekhie
 The blood has started to freeze and his complexion has turned a bit black
 forencik vigyaan ke mutabik jaise-jaise maut kaa vakt bitta jaataa he, khun kii rangath badalane lagati he
 It turns brown with ruddy red and then turns almost black
 bad gaye goliyon ke nishaanalekin dono tasveeron main samanta ye he ki laash kii pojishan nahin badali he
 Munna Bajrangi's hand position is the same in both the first and second photographs
 lekin hairaan karne vaali baat ye he ki pehali tasviir main jahaan munna bajrangi ke seene main sirf ek goli kaa nishaan dikh rahaa he, vahiin duusari tasviir main goli ke teen nishaan dikh rahe hai
 In the first picture, Munna Bajrangi appears to have been shot from the top of the vest in the middle of his chest, but there is no trace of bullet anywhere else in the body
 lekin duusari tasviir main seene ke bichobich maari gai goli kaa nishaan to he hi, iske alaava seene ke bagal main bhi goli maarane ke do nishaan dikh rahe hai
 After seeing these two pictures, it seems clear that after taking the first picture, Munna Bajrangi was shot at least three bullets
 iske baad phir se duusari tasviir clic kii gai
 It is also clear from the marks of the bullets seen in the second picture that the bullets that were killed later were killed completely by Munna Bajrangi's chest
 kyonki najadik se chalaai goli se niklaa barood marane vaale ke sharir par saaf dikh rahaa he
 This happens only when the bullet is fired from a distance of at least half a foot
 yani kii pehle munna bajrangi ke goli maari gai, photo khichin gai
 After this, at least three bullets were shot again to confirm the death and the picture was taken again
 yah donon tasviren munna bajrangi kii hatya ko lekar kai sawaal khadey karti hai-:- pehali tasviir kyon khichin gai?- hatya ke baad laash kii photo khinchne kaa kya makasad tha?- kya munna bajrangi kii laash kii pehali photo hatyare ne hi khinchi, yaa koi or tha?- kya hatyare ne pehali tasviir khinchakar kisi ko bheji thi?- kya hatyare ne jise pehali tasviir bheji, usne munna bajrangi ko or goliyaan maarane kaa aadesh diya tha?- kya hatyare ne kisi ke ishaare par munna bajrangi kii hatya kii thi?- jaankaree ke mutabik hatya ke vakt barrack ke paas lagasisitivikam nahi kar rahaa tha
 Was this done intentionally, or is it just the negligence of the prison administration? - The way the murderer was shot in the High Security barrack, it is clear that he was so leisurely that no one would catch him until the work was done
 to kya jail prashasan yaa system kaa aadmi hatyare se mila hua tha?- hatya ke fairan baad photo kheenchna, phir or goliyaan markar duusari tasviir kheenchna saaf karata he ki hatyara kisi ke sampark main tha
 Is this really a matter of contract killing? - Or is it the government machinery itself that has set Munna Bajrangi under a planned conspiracy? Munna Bajrangi's wife accuses the Union minister of murdering all the suspicions about the murder of Munna Bajrangi Also arising because Munna Bajrangi's wife, Seema Singh, had accused UP STF a few days ago in a press conference Micro tot can get killed
 ajtak ke paas maujuud munna bajrangi kii hatya ke baad kii dono photo kaaphi saaf ishaara karti he jisamen hatya ke aaropee sunil rathi, jail prashasan se lekar upi police sab shaq ke ghere me hai
 Now it remains to be seen whether any investigation can bring out the truth of this murder
 bhartiya filmon ko videshi box offis par relies kiye jane kaa chalan vakt ke saath kaaphi teji se badhata ja rahaa he
 When films like Aamir Khanki Dangal and Secret Superstar won their fame in other countries, the attention of the makers of other films also went to this side
 nateeja ye hua ki apni filmon ko bharat ke alaava baaki deshon main bhi relies kiye jane kii ek hode si shuru ho gai
 What depends on the profits of Indian films abroad? What is the reason that the makers want to release their films in other countries besides India? After all, what does it benefit and how strong is the possibility of that benefit? In fact, the profits of Indian films are determined based on the taxation of the film released abroad and the profit made after its release there
 kam compatishan or badi fain folowing kaa miltaa he phydamerica main bharat kii tulana main kaaphi kam filmein relies hoti hai
 Also, there is a considerable population of Indians there
 yahi vajah he ki vahaan par film ke chalane kii sambhaavna bhi zyada hoti he or baaki filmon ke saath hone vaala compatishan bhi kam hota he
 Apart from this, there is a good fan following of some Indian artist in every country, which benefits people
 stars kii fain folowing or imotional kahani he Key factorjaise china main aamir khan kii acchhee khaasi fain folowing he thik usee tarah arab deshon main log shahrukh khan ke diwane hai
 People in America like Amitabh Bachchan quite a lot
 aise main in deshon main kalakaar vishesh kii film relies karne kaa phayda miltaa hi miltaa he
 Another argument is also made that emotional stories are rarely made in countries other than India

 bhartiya or chini sena ke bich lagaataar tanaav kii khabaren ai hai, lekin sikkim main is saal kii shuruyaat main jab donon deshon ke sainikon kaa aamanaa-saamana hua tha donon ne ek duusare ko rasagulle khilaae or bear pilaai thi
 If sources are to be believed, the encounter between the soldiers of the two countries occurred near Tangkar La Pass at a height of 16 thousand feet in East Sikkim when a Chinese patrol entered the Indian territory
 sutron ne bataaya ki halke vaahanon main safar kar rahe china ke gashti dal ko vahaan bhartiya sena ke us dal ne dekha jisamen ek yuva leftinent ke alaava nau jawan the
 The Indian patrol stopped the Chinese patrol at Tangkar La Pass and after that the two showed banners to each other and asked each other to leave the area and move to their respective areas
 sutron ne bataaya ki china ke sainikon ne waapas lautate samay bhartiya sainikon ko badwiser bear ke can die, jabaki hamaare sainikon ne unhen rasagulle ke packet die
 In recent times, there has been increased incursion by Chinese troops from the Line of Actual Control between the two countries from Ladakh in Jammu and Kashmir in the north to Arunachal Pradesh in the northeast
 chini sainikon dwaara ghuspaith par raksha mantri eke antni ne haal main kaha tha ki ‘bharat or china ke bich vaastavik niyantran rekha saamaanya rup se ankit nahin he
 There are areas on the border about which India and China have different perceptions and both sides send their patrols to that place
 ’unhone kaha tha, ‘vaastavik niyantran rekha kii dharna par matbhed ke chalate jameen par kuch atikaraman kii ghatnaayen hoti hai
 The Government takes up any encroachment through regular arrangements with the Chinese side

 a new study has revealed that sharing photos on social networking sites deprives you of experiencing the joy of real life
 is adhyayan se pataa chalaa he ki 58 pratishat log maanate hai ki soshal citon par tasviren saajha karne se ve jivan kii saamaanya gatividhiyon kaa lutf nahin uthaa pate
 According to 'mashabal' report, the best-selling authors like Joseph Graney and David Maxfield surveyed 1,623 people in this study by the New York Times
 is surveykshan kaa uddeshy yah pataa lagaana tha ki kis tarah se soshal media unke jivan ko prabhavit kar rahaa he
 Maxfield researched the subject more when he went on holiday with his family on his 60th birthday and discovered that his focus was more on sharing those moments on social media than on experiencing the joy of the holiday
 is prakriya ko unhone 'trophy hanting' kaa naam diya, jisamen 'trophy hunters' kaa dhyaan jivan ke palon kaa anand lene ke bajaae yaadgaar palon kii tasviren khinch kar unhen soshal media par saajha karne par adhik rahata he
 91 percent of the participants in the study reported that they were more busy sharing pictures on social sites than they did during their visit, rather than experiencing their memorable moments
 maxfield ne sujhaayaa ki logon ko adhik jaagruk banane or soshal media ke istemaal ko simit karne kii jarurat he
 They should capture each moment of life and experience it happily instead of garnering it towards a trophy
 chhattisgarh vidhansabha main congress ke kade tewaron ko thanda karne ke liye sattadhari bijepi ne aisa raag chhedaa ki sadan main congress kii bolti band ho gayi
 BJP demanded the handing over of investigations into allegations of sexual exploitation against NSUI national president Feroze Khan
 bijepi ne congress ko aade haathon lete hue kaha ki AICC ke bajaae is maamle ko use police ko saunpa janaa tha
 With this BJP trump card, there was a sudden peace in the Congress camp which is making noise in the house
 chhattisgarh vidhaan sabha main do dinon se bijepi or congress ke bich jamkar rassakasi chal rahi he
 This is the last meeting of Chief Minister Raman Singh's third term
 paanch dinon tak chalane vaale is satr ke do din biit chuke hai
 The name of Congress was on both days
 congress ne sadan ke andar or baahar bijepi par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 Never laid siege to the party for not fulfilling the promises made in its manifesto
 to kabhi kisaanon, mazdooron, sarkari karmchaariyon kii samasyaon ke niraakaran naa hone ke saath saath bhrashtachar ke maamalon main pardaa daalane ko lekar sarkaar kii bakhiyaan udhedi
 Both days, the BJP kept searching for safe havens in the House for the Congress
 is bich usne NSUI ke rashtriya adhyaksh farroj khan par lage yon shoshan ke aaropon kaa mudda sadan main oochaal diya
 The BJP has demanded that the victimized woman leader of Bhilai in Chhattisgarh who has submitted her complaint to the AICC as a complaint, should now be sent to the police
 taaki congressiyon kaa asli cheharaa benakaab ho sake
 As soon as the matter bounced, the Congressmen came into the can
 bijepi vidhayak devji bhai patel ne congress par aarope lagaaya ki wo yon shoshan ke is maamle ko rafa dfa karne main juty hui he
 Due to this, the exploited daughter of Chhattisgarh is not getting justice
 devji bhai patel ne maamle kii ucch stareey jaanch karaane kii maang ko lekar sadan kaa dhyaan khinchaa
 On the other hand, defending the party, the Leader of Opposition T
 es
 Singh Dev said that the AICC is investigating the matter with utmost seriousness and action will also be taken against the culprits
 sadan se baahar nikalne ke baad unhone aaj tak se kaha ki vidhaan sabha adhyaksh ne is maamle main unke virodhiyon ko koi vyavastha nahin di
 Actually, the state representative of NSUI from Chhattisgarh had accused its national president of sexual exploitation
 is peedit mahila netri ne in aaropon ke saath kuch saboot bhi AICC ko saunpe the
 The victim girl also said that if she does not get justice from the party forum, she will go to the police shelter
 is shikaayat ke baad AICC ne maamle kii jaanch ke liye teen sadasyi cameti bhi gathit kii
 a month has passed since the complaint, but the investigation of the case has not been completed yet
 lihaaja jaanch main let latifi kaa aarope laga kar bijepi ne sadan ke bheetar congress ko gher liya
 Now only two days are left for the end of the session of the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly
 in do dinon main congress ne bijepi se puure pandrah saalon kaa hisaab-kitaab karne ke liye jor lagaaya hua he
 The new session of the Legislative Assembly will now be called only after the formation of the new government
 lihaaja is vidhaan sabha satr main bijepi par hamalaa tej karne ke liye congress rojaanaa nayi ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he
 But with the BJP giving rise to the issue of sexual exploitation, the aspirations of the Congress seem to be withering
 congress ne vidhansabha adhyaksh ko saunpa shikayati patravahin, chhattisgarh vidhansabha ke pehle din kii karrwai khatm hone ke baad der shaam congress ne ek shikayati patr vidhaan sabha sachivalay ko saunpa
 In this letter, the Speaker has been demanded that MLA Amit Jogi R
 being involved in anti-party activities
 ke
 Legislative Assembly membership of Rai and MLA Siyaram Kaushik should be abolished
 congress ne iske liye dalbadal kanoon kaa hawala bhi diya
 Let me tell you, these three mlas left the Congress nearly two years ago and joined the Chhattisgarh Janata Congress
 ajit jogi ke kheme main jane ke baad teenon hi vidhayak congress par hamalaa karne se peeche nahin rahete
 They often act to open up the poll of all Congress leaders with their statements
 is vajah se congress ne inaki vidhayaki khatm karne ke liye vidhaan sabha adhyaksh ko patr saupa he
 But this step of the Congress does not seem to be effective, because the proceedings of the Legislative Assembly are only two days away from ending indefinitely
 lihaaja mana ja rahaa he ki congress se nilambit chal rahe teenon hi vidhayak apana kaarykaal puraa karenge

 The demand to form a government again is rising within the AAP
 party ke kuch vidhayakon ne shanivaar ko bijepi yaa congress ke samarthan se dilli main ek baar phir se sarkaar banane kaa suzav diya
 However, later Delhi Congress President Arvinder Singh Lovely dismissed these reports
 unhone kaha ki congress ne koi samarthan prastaav nahin bheja he or na hi party main is vishay par koi charchaa ho rahi he
 Sources in the AAP said that party MLA Rajesh Garg took the view of Arvind Kejriwal's decision to resign from the government in 49 days in February as the main reason for aap's poor performance in the Lok Sabha elections
 mana ja rahaa he ki rohinee ke vidhayak ne kaha ki party ko sarkaar banane par vichaar karnaa chahie taaki janata ko is faisle se laabh mili

 jile hi nahin puure pradesh main praathmik shiksha ke girte str par chintaa jaahir karte hue kanpur jile ke basic shiksha adhikari (biio) rajendra prasad yadav ne primary teachers or veshyaaon ko ek hi taraazoo main taul diya
 According to BYO, today more prostitutes than teachers do their work with full dedication and duty

 si (nagar sansaadhan centre) premanagar vaarshik shaikshik samaaroh jashn-e-talim-2014 samaaroh main unhone ye baat kahi
 The theme of this ceremony was talim-tarbiyat-tehzeeb
 kaarykram main mukhya atithi kanpur ke jila basic shiksha adhikari rajendra prasad yadav the
 During this period, about 20 primary women teachers were also honored by the Basic Education Officer upon their retirement
 biio ne yun kii veshya or teachers kii tulana:manch par mike sambhalate hi kanpur jile ke basic shiksha adhikari rajendra prasad yadav ne haul main baithe primary skool ke teacheron kii ore mukhaatib hote hue kaha ki ‘man ke haare haar he, man ke jite jeet’
 After that what the BEO said, there was silence in the hall
 darasal biio ne jile hi nahin puure pradesh main primary skulon main girte shiksha ke str par chintaa jaahir karte hue kaha ki ek veshya bhi apane kaam ko samaj leti he ki veshyavriti hamaare bhagya main likhaa he, to usko bhi bade eemaandaaree se satyanishtha se karti he
 But far from fulfilling the duties given to our teachers, they are ashamed to teach them to young children, all the teachers consider it as their disrespectful, they feel insulted and shunned from teaching
 jo aaj ke samay kii sabase badi kami he
 Despite the facilities, the level of education is falling: According to Rajendra Yadav, if the teachers of today assess their deficiency then they will see their faults
 unke mutabik vartmaan main basic shiksha main tamaam suvidhaon ke baavjood iske str main din pratidin giravat aati ja rahi he
 But this blame is not only from the teacher, but also from the parents
 unhone apane daur kii shiksha ko yaad karte hue kaha ki wo bhi primary skool se hi shiksha lekar aaj yahaan tak pahunche hai
 The environment and discipline used to be in primary schools at that time has changed completely today
 shashan kii manshaa he ki ham bhay mukt shiksha den, lekin vyavhaar main jab ham bhay mukt shiksha dene chalate hai to kahin naa kahin kathnai kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Recalling his days, he said, when we read, the Guru and the disciple had an unbreakable relationship, even before we were punished
 magar kisi ke gargian se shikaayat nahin aati thi or jitani us sajaa kii jarurat aaj ke parivesh ke liye he, utani us samay nahin thi
 We were quite disciplined compared to today
 guruon kaa aadar karte the or samay se kaam karte the, phir bhi agar koi kami rah jaati thi to pitayee hoti thi
 We feared that there was no one to protect us from the house, but if Guruji told the news in the house, he would be beaten in the house also
 is bhay kii aaj jarurat he
 But the intention of the government is that if you frighten them, they cannot even read
 jabaki vyavhaar main aap mahasoos karte hai ki aisi chizon kii jarurat he
 This is also one of the main reasons for the decline in education
 ‘man ke haare haar, man ke jite jeet’:biio ke anusaar baccha chaahe jis rup main aae, magar vah vidwaan hokar teacher kii sharan main nahin aata he
 When you want to take him, you will take interest in him, when you feel a sense of duty in you then surely that child can be improved
 magar jab aap ye maan lete hai ki ye itane naakaam bachche hai ki ye kuch sikh nahin sakate, to man ke haare haar he, man ke jite jeet
 When you make up your mind that this child cannot learn anything, then surely your attitude changes and that child cannot learn anything
 teachers ko apane vishay main koi concept clear hi nahin:unke mutabik sabase badi baat ye he ki aaj ke zyaadaatar teachers ko apane vishay kaa concept hi clear nahin he
 Therefore, you have to understand what you have to teach first and you should have your passion in it
 jis teacher ko apane vishay kaa concept saaf nahin hoga, wo apane bacchon ko acchhee shiksha nahin de saktaa
 Learning something on one's own is an art, but learning the same thing on another is another art
 isliye jab aapkaa apane vishay kaa concept saaf hoga, tab aap ye samaj paaenge ki aap jo apane bacchon ko siikhaa rahe hai usamen use kahaan-kahaan kathinaayee aa rahi he
 a teacher is the greatest guide for society and the nation, with the burden of the nation on its shoulder
 aap jaisaa baccha banaakar nikaalenge desh main vaisaa hi prakaash hoga
 Government school teachers do not want to teach: People have the greatest desire to teach in government schools
 par vahaan ke bacchon ko koi padhaanaa nahin chahta
 Today, the maximum number of applications and maximum applications comes in the Education Department
 ek pad ke liye lakhon aavedan aate hai, to ye to ham maanane se rahe ki sarkari vidyalayon main padhaane ke liye koi nahin janaa chahta
 Today there are a large number of teachers who do not know the names of the children of their class nor the parents of those children
 jabaki hamaare jamaane main guru bacchon ke saath abhibhavakon kaa naam bhi jaanate the
 We will only make a request to our teacher colleagues that you give the best education to your children
 aapke andar gyaan he, aapke andar wo shakti he jo in bacchon ko ek achche naagarik ke rup main laane kaa kaam kar sakati he

 govinda or unke kamedian bhaanje krishna abhishek kaa vivaad sulajhata najar aa rahaa he
 Krishna can apologize once again
 darasal, krishna ne ek coment ke liye apni patni kashmira shah ko galat bataaya he
 In an interview to Spotboya, Krishna said, 'whatever Kashmiri wrote on social media that day, it may be that Mami felt bad
 haalanki, usne maami ke liye nahin, balki meri bahan ke liye likhaa tha
 There were 2 mistakes from Kashmiri, one was wrong at the time he posted
 doosraa yah ki use kisi ke bhi bare main vaisaa nahin likhnaa chaiye tha
 Krishna further said, "my wife Kashmira has made a mistake and she should apologize to Mami
" "ek vakt par govinda ne kii thim 40 filmein sinabataa den ki kashmira ne soshal ek post main likhaa tha, 'log paison ke liye naach rahe hai
 'actually, Govinda is said to have come to Krishna's comedy show with money
 shaayad isi baat ko lekar kashmira ne govinda ko target kiya
 The dispute between Govinda and Krishna has been going on for a long time
 haal hi main krishna ne apane judawaan bacchon kaa janmdin manaaya, lekin is party se govinda or unki patni sunita gaayab the
 Sunita said in a conversation, we have made a distance from them and this will never change
 krishna ke beton kii berth de party se nadaarad rahane ke sawaal par sunita ne kaha, "ham us date (3 june) main landan main the
 But this is not the only reason for not joining the party, in fact we were not called
 "bhaanje krishna se govinda kii baatcheet band, patni boleen-ab sab kuch khatm There was a lot of uproar in the Vidhan Sabha on the third day of the assembly session
 vipaksh ke netaa vijendra gupta ne point of order ke tahat dilli sarkaar ke vigyapanon par kaig report ko sadan main pesh karne kaa mudda uthaaya, jise spikar ne sweekaar nahin kiya
 On this, Vijender Gupta started shouting slogans in the House
 is mudde par gupta or spikar ke bich niyamon ko lekar khub nokajhonk bhi hui
 Meanwhile, Vijender Gupta asked to dissolve the assembly and said that the Constitution is not being followed in the House
 is par dilli sarkaar ke mantristyendra jainbhadak gaye
 He said that Vijender Gupta is threatening to dissolve the Assembly as he has a government at the Center
 baad main duusare vidhayak bhi gupta ke bayaan ke virodh main utaar aae
 Alka Lamba then demanded that the matter be referred to the Privileges Committee
 haalanki spikar ne is maang par koi faisla nahin sunaaya
 The speaker said that he would consider it
 yah puche jane par ki kya yah behatar tareeke se manage ho saktaa tha, vah bole- yadi aapkaa pravartan vibhaag, iti, kamjor he to yah manage nahin ho saktaa
 This is an administrative issue
 kya aapako lagata he ki inakam tex adhikariyon ko nahin pataa ki kiske paas kaala paisa he? agle chah maheene bahut hi avyavasthit honge, vaise yah is par nirbhar karegaa ki aap kitni jaldi nai karency le aate hai
 If there is no cash problem then why is there a limit on withdrawal
 jab unase poocha gaya ki aapane kaha tha ki upie sarkaar ke shasankaal main bhi yah masalaa uthaa tha lekin aapane ise 'rifus' kar diya, to unhone kaha ki haa, hamen laga ki yah nahin kiya janaa chahie or bas hamane ise lagu nahin kiya
 It is said that seeing an opportunity is a great skill to surprise
 yah kisi party kaa tikat dilaane se lekar jindagi main kai oonche mukaam tak hasil kara saktaa he
 Despite being useless, it makes you the star of many eyes
 karnaa kuch nahin hota he, bas mauka padane par apane kisi gun kii prerana apane tatkaalik kaam ke aadmi ko bataa dena hota he
 Now how can Bollywood also remain untouched by this
 hero-heroinon ko kaam chahie to kisi ko to muska maarna padegaa
 If work has been found and one or two films have become a hit, then to stay alive, the fans of the film world will also occasionally read the praises
 ab aisa hi kuch jaclin ne bhi kiya
 His last few films went well
 salmaan khan kii kik ne to takadir hi badal di
 His friendship with Salman also froze
 yah baat jagajaahir he ki jab salmaan khan kaa haath ho to acting gaun ho jaati he, bhashaa myne nahin rakhti or expreshans kii zyada jarurat nahin rahati or ek hasina katrina caff ban jaati he
 Inspired by this, Sri Lankan Hasina has revealed that her Hindi Salman Khan has improved
 sallu bhai ne har maukey par unhen hindi bolne ke liye prerit kiya
 Salman really encourages new people
 phir yah videshi kanyaayein hon to or bhi zyada
 By the way, it is also said that Jacqueline kept a teacher for Hindi and Urdu till a few days ago
 jinka naam kamaal ahamed he
 He was talked to in connection with a story
 jab main unase hindi sikhaane ke vishay par phone se baat kar rahaa tha, to usee dauraan jaclin bhi vahiin thim, or unhone jaclin se meri baat bhi karai
 Jacqueline answered most of my questions in Hindi
 maine kamaal sahab ko badhai di
 And this was a little before the kick
 kamaal sahab unhen dilo-jaan se hindi sikhaa rahe the
 Now Jacqueline had to speak Hindi one day
 lekin unhone apni is kala ko jaahir karne or samarpit karne ke liye salmaan khan ko chunakar phultos gend par chakka jadne jaisaa kaam kar diya or siddh kar diya ki unhen bhi mauka dekhakar chaukaa maarna aata he
 Salman Khan became the real inspiration, and Jacqueline learned fluent Hindi from him in a film
 vaaki yah kamaal he
 In this way every human needs a salman
 
 
 isliye bhaijan saavdhaan

 unhone is jeet ko loktantr ke itihaas main sabase badi ghatana bataaya
 He said, 'after independence, many Lok Sabha elections were held in the country, but the highest turnout was in this election
 wo bhi 40-42 degree kii garmi main
 This in itself reflects public awareness
 puure vishwa ko ise pahchaanana hoga
 'he said,' i express my condolences to the people who have sacrificed for the sake of democracy and those who have been injured
 loktantr main loktantr ke liye maranaa, yah mishaal aane vaali pidiyon ko prerana detii rahegi
 i congratulate the Election Commission, the security forces and all those who have handled this celebration of democracy
 'piem modi ne kaha, 'jab mahabharat kaa yuddh samaapt hua to krishna se poocha gaya ki aap kiske paksh main the
 i understand that God had responded at that time, today the public has given the same answer as Krishna
 bhagwaan ne us samay kaha tha ki main kisi ke paksh main nahin tha
 i was standing in favor of Hastinapur only for Hastinapur
 aaj 130 karod janata bharat ke liye bharat ke paksh main khadi he
 The spirit of the common citizen of the country is a guarantee of India's bright future
 'piem modi ne kaha, 'main pehle din se kah rahaa tha ki yah chunaav koi dal yaa netaa nahin balki desh kii janata lard rahi he
 For those whose eyes were closed, it was difficult to understand my point
 lekin aaj meri bhaavana ko janata janardan ne prakat kar diya he
 So if someone is victorious then Hindustan is victorious, if anyone is victorious then democracy is victorious
 isliye ham sabhi endie ke saathi is vijay ko janata ke charnon main samarpit karte hai
 The PM further said, 'those who have won this Lok Sabha election
 main unhen bahut-bahut badhai detaa hum
 i congratulate all the winners who will work shoulder to shoulder and work for the development of the country
 'chaar vidhansabha chunaavon main jeetne vaali partiyon ko badhai dete hue piem modi ne kaha ki main sabhi rajyon ko vishwaas dilaanaa chahta hum ki hamaari party or sarkaar samvidhan par samarpit he
 Is dedicated to the federal system
 hamaari sarkaar in rajyon ke vikaas ke liye kandhe se kandhaa milakar chalegi, yah vishwaas dilaanaa chahta hum
 He also praised the hard work of the party workers and congratulated them on the victory
 piem modi ne party kii yatra par baat karte hue kaha ki bhaajapa kii visheshta he ki ham kabhi do bhi ho gaye lekin ham kabhi apane maarg se vichlit nahin hue or phir dobaaraa aa gaye
 When two were still not disappointed and would come again, they would not leave the sacrament, nor would they leave the order or humility
 unhone kaha ki yah modi kii vijay nahin he, yah desh main eemaandaaree ke liye tadapati aashaa, aakankshaon kii vijay he
 This victory is that of a sick person who could not get treatment due to lack of money and is being treated today
 yah vijay un kisaanon kii he jo desh ke pet ko bharne ke liye apane pet ke khyal ko darkinar karke kaam main juta rahata he
 This is the victory of the recent entrants to the pucca house
 piem modi ne kaha ki yah vijay un madhyam vargeey logon kii vijay he jo bina soche tex bharta rahaa he
 This election has given a new acceptance to honesty
 secularism ke naare lagane vaali jamaat ne 2014 se 2019 aate aate bolnaa hi band kar diya
 They were exposed
 unhone kaha ki hindustan main aisa koi bhi chunaav nahin hua jab mahangaai mudda nahin bani ho, lekin is chunaav main vipaksh ne ek baar bhi ise mudda nahin banaaya
 Also, this was the first election when no party could accuse the government of corruption
 isliye raajnneetik panditon ko samaj nahin aa rahaa tha ki ise kaise taula jaae
 He said that the public has put a new Narrative in front of the country
 wo yah he ki ab is desh main do hi jati bachegi or desh in do jatiyon par hi kendrit rahane vaala he
 Those who play sports in the name of caste have been hit hard in this election
 ek jati he garib or duusari jati he jo unhen garibi se mukt karana chaahate hai
 These are two castes
 hamen donon ko shashakt karnaa he
 Both these powers can erase the stigma of poverty from this country
 unhone kaha ki yahi wo samay he jab mahatma gandhi ke 150 varsh manayega or aazaadee ke 75 varsh manayega
 From 1942 to 1947, every person did everything for freedom
 1942 se 1947 tak ek janandolan ne aazaadee main ek ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 This period was very important in the history of the country
 aaj agar ham bhi sankalp len ki desh ko viksit bharat bananaa he to desh ko ham nai oonchaaiyon par le ja sakate hai
 Therefore, we have to accept this election with humility
 piem modi ne kaha, 'chunaav main kya hua, kaise hua, koun bolaa, kya bolaa, mere liye wo baaten biit chuki hai
 Now we have to move forward
 virodhiyon ko bhi saath lekar chalanaa he
 Walk between the limits of democracy
 samvidhan kaa bhav pakadte hue chalanaa he
 i want to assure that the people have filled the bag of this fakir, i am full of hope and aspirations
 main is gambhirtha ko bhi samajhataa hum
 But i will say that the public trusted me knowing less in 2014 and trusting me after knowing more in 2019
 main iske peeche kii bhaavana ko bhalee bhaanti samajhataa hum
 Therefore, i want to say that for the responsibility that the country has given me, i promise that i will not do any thing with bad luck
 'unhone kaha ki kaam karte-karte galati ho sakati he lekin koi bhi kaam badaniyat se nahin karuunga
 i will not do anything for me
 aage unhone kaha ki mere samay kaa pal-pal, mere sharir kaa kan-kan sirf deshavaasiyon ke liye he
 Whenever the public assesses me, keep tightening me on these three scales
 kabhi koi kami rah jaae to mujhe koste rahanaa
 But i want to assure that i will do my best to live up to what i tell in public
 anuchhed 35 e ko lekar jammu kashmir main algaavvaadiyon ne dar kaa maahaul bana diya he
 For the past one week, fearful postures have been shown in the name of performance in the valley
 is bich algaavvaadiyon ne do din kaa band bhi bulaayaa he
 The effect of this bandh was that the government has put a brake on the Amarnath Yatra leaving from Jammu on Monday
 darasal, somvaar ko anuchhed 35 e ko lekar daayar kii gai arji par supreme court main sunwaayee honi he
 Against which Hurriyat leaders have called for a bandh
 yah arji pichley 4 saal se pending he
 In 2014, the legal battle over Article 35A reached the Supreme Court
 lekin pichley chaar saal main is par sirf baat hi hui he
 'the consequences of lifting the tricolor would be bad', the question is, what is it in the name of Article 35A from which the screams of Hurriyat are coming out? Hurriyat leader Bilal War says Kashmir is one because of 35A
 agar ise hataaya gaya to jang chhid jaaegi
 However, with regard to Article 35A, all parties in the valley are seen to be serving their political interests
 kya 35 e ke hatane kaa matlab algaavvaad kii dukaane band hona he, agar nahin, to kyon supreme court main sunwaayee bhar se hurriyat netaa kashmir ko daraa rahe hai or desh ko dhamka rahe hai? neshnal conference ke netaa javed rana ne kaha ki band ke dauraan koi tirangaa nahin uthayega
 The consequences will be bad if you do this
 anuchhed 35 e aaj se 64 saal pehle kashmir ke liye laayaa gaya tha
 Kashmir was then given exclusive rights separate from other states of the country
 lekin 64 saalon main is par lagaataar sawaal bhi uthte rahe hai ki kashmir ke liye alag kanoon kyon he or kya aise hi kanoon algaavvaad kii jad he?35 e par ek hue umr abdulla or mahabuuba muftianuchhed 35 e kaa mudda uthte hi ek duusare ke raajnneetik virdohi umr abdulla or mahabuuba mufti kii party kaa jaise gathbandhan ho gaya
 Both the parties took to the road with threats and intimidation of the country over Kashmir
 kendriya mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne kaha ki koi bhi maamla court main he usamen bahes chal rahi he or argument main jammu kashmir ko lekar sarkaar apana paksh rakhegi
 No need to create a ruckus before the hearing
 vahiin, congress kah rahi he ki dhara 370 or 35 e ab vaisaa nahin rahaa
 However, it is difficult for the Congress to speak clearly on this issue
 lekin bijepi kaa to ye raajnneetik agenda rahaa he, phir bhi sarkaar court main 35 e par saaf raay nahin rakh pai
 At the same time, BJP leaders have been openly speaking that there should not be 35A
 ise hatana chahie
 What is Article 35A and why it is said that the roots of separatism are hidden in this, let us know
 
 
 > anuchhed 35A se jammu kashmir ko ye adhikaar mila he ki wo kise apana sthai nivasee maane or kise nahin
 > The Government of Jammu and Kashmir considers those who settled in Kashmir before 14 May 1954
 > aise sthai nivaasiyon ko jameen kharidne, rojgaar paane or sarkari yojanaon main vishesh adhikaar mili hai
 > a resident of another state of the country cannot settle in Jammu and Kashmir as a permanent resident
 > duusare rajyon ke nivasee naa kashmir main jameen kharid sakate hai, naa rajya sarkaar unhen naukari de sakati he
 > If a woman from Jammu and Kashmir marries a person from another state in India, her rights are taken away
 > umr abdulla kii shaadi bhi rajya se baahar kii mahila se hui he, lekin unke bacchon ko rajya ke saare adhikaar hasil hai
 Omar Abdullah's sister Sara Abdullah is denied property rights after marrying a person from outside the state
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 ke tahat hi joda gaya tha anuchhed 35e> anuchhed 370 kii vajah se jammu kashmir ke nagarikon ke paas dohari naagarikta he
 > Due to Article 370, there is a separate flag and separate constitution in Jammu and Kashmir
 > isaki vajah se kashmir main vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal 6 saal kaa hota he, jabaki anya rajyon main 5 saal kaa hota he
 > Due to this, the Indian Parliament has very limited powers to make laws regarding Jammu and Kashmir
 > sansad main paas kanoon jammu kashmir main lagu nahin hote jaise naa shiksha kaa adhikaar, naa soochna kaa adhikaar
 > Neither reservation is available, nor does the law of minimum wage apply
 kya he iskaa kanoonee pahalu?> 2014 main ve da citigens naam ke ek NGO ne supreme court main arji lagaai thi
 > The petition challenged the validity of Article 35A and Article 370 of the Constitution
 > ye daleel di gai ki samvidhan banaate vakt kashmir ke aise vishesh darje kii koi baat nahin kahi gai thi
 > Even four members of the Constituent Assembly who drafted the Constitution were from Kashmir itself
 > anuchhed 370 tempreri praavdhaan tha, jo us vakt halaat saamaanya or loktantr majboot karne ke liye laayaa gaya tha
 > The framers of the Constitution did not think that provisions like 35A would be added in the name of Article 370
 > anuchhed 35 e us bhaavana par chot karata he jo ek bharat ke taur par puure desh ko jodta he
 > Lack of rights of citizens of other states in Jammu and Kashmir is against the basic rights of the Constitution
 kya he anuchhed 35 e kaa itihaas?> anuchhed 35A ko raashtrapati ke ek aadesh se samvidhan main saal 1954 main joda gaya tha
 > This order was issued on the advice of the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's cabinet
 > isse do saal pehle 1952 main nehru or shaikh abdulla kaa dilli samjhauta hua tha
 > Under which Indian citizenship was enforced in the subjects of the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 > lekin anuchhed 35 e ko khaas taur par kashmir ke special states ko dikhaane ke liye laayaa gaya
 > The argument of protest is that this is the presidential order, which should be abolished
 kyonki is par sansad main koi charchaa or bahes nahin hui
 > 35A was added to the Constitution through such an order without telling Parliament
 anuchhed 35 e ko hataane ke peeche ye he dalianuchhed 35 eke khilaaf arji lagane vaale NGO kaa kahana he ki wo supreme court se is maamle kii sunwaayee ke liye ek sanvaidhanik peeth banane kii apil karegi
 The biggest argument for removing Article 35A is that it was not implemented through Parliament
 balki raashtrapati aadesh se jabaran thopa gaya
 The second big argument is that during partition, a large number of people came to India from Pakistan 
 inamen lakhon kii sankhya main log jammu kashmir main bhi bas gaye the, lekin anuchhed 35 e kii vajah se in sabhi ko sthaayee nivasee hone kaa haq chin liya gaya
 Majority of such millions are from hindu-sikh community
 chunaav ayog ne raashtrapati chunaav kii ghoshnaa kar di, to vipakshi partiyaan bhi besabri se sarkaar ke pattey kholane tak apane ummidavaar ko talashne main juty hai
 Sonia Gandhi, who led the opposition unity, had discussed this at lunch with the leaders of 17 opposition parties, before that sonia-rahul met all the big opposition leaders
 lekin abhi tak kisi ek vipakshi ummidavaar kaa naam final nahin ho sakaa he
 Four names have been revealed so far
 unamem sabase pehla naam sharad pavaar kaa tha, lekin power sonia ko naa kah chuke hai
 Later, the NCP officially made it clear that Sonia had offered Pawar, but she refused
 darasal, congress samet sabhi vipakshi jaanate hai ki, wiesar congress ke samarthan ke baad number game sarkaar ke haq main he
 The government is also in touch with the AIADMK and TRS
 isliye chunaav haarane ke liye pavaar bhala kaise haa karte
 However, Pawar can be ready if the ruling party also agrees on his name, which at least the opponents are not expecting
 haal hi main power ne pradhanmantri modi se mulaakaat kar nai atakalon ko zarur hawa de di he
 According to sources, Pawar's attempt is also that such a candidate should come from the government, which the opposition does not have any objection, so that the election will not come
 vipaksh main gopalkrishna gandhi kaa naam sabase ageiske alaava sharad yadav or mira kumaar ke naam kii bhi charchaa ho chuki he, lekin inkaa becoground rajnatik he
 In such a situation, CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury suggested the name of Mahatma Gandhi's great-grandson Gopalakrishna Gandhi, who is currently in the race
 saath hi congress saaf kar chuki he ki, vipakshi ekta ke liye vah congress se baahar ke ummidavaar ke liye taiyaar he
 Actually, the arithmetic of 17 parties including Mayawati, Yechury, Pawar, Akhilesh, Mamta, Nitish, Karunanidhi, Lalu also cannot beat the government
 saath hi bijd or tiares ko bhi saath laane kii koshishen ho rahi hai
 Opposition parties are hopeful that AAP and Owaisi will vote against the BJP
 annadramuk bhi pattey nahin khol rahi
 But all these together cannot defeat the government candidate
 haa, vipakshi shivasena sareekhe sarkaar ke sahyogiyon ko jarur todane kii firaaq main he
 Overall, all these exercises are a big step towards forming the Grand Alliance before 2019, more than winning the presidential election
 haalanki, vipakshi dalon kii pasand raashtrapati pranav mukherjee bhi the, lekin unhone bhi saaf kar diya ki, wo chunaav nahin ladenge yani sarkaar or vipaksh kii sahmati par hi dobaaraa raashtrapati ban sakate hai, vahiin sarkaar ke sutara saaf kar chuke hai ki, wo apana ummidavaar denge or pranav ko phir ummidavaar nahin banaaenge
 The government's secular candidate will be accepted! In such a situation, the opposition wants to let the name of the government candidate appear first
 jiske baad hi wo tay karegaa ki, sarkaar ke saath us ummidavaar par sahmati ban sakati he ki nahin
 By the way, the opposition believes that the government candidate should be secular and acceptable to all
 kai netaaon kahana he ki ham chahenge ki, aisa ho
 But we have little hope from Modi government, that's why we are simultaneously looking for our candidate
 samanvay ke liye banegaa gruphis bich sonia gandhi ne vipakshi partiyon ke samanvay ke liye sabhi partiyon se netaaon kaa ek chota group banane kaa faisla kiya he, jaldi hi uskaa gathan kar diya jayega
 On this issue, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said, `` It has been decided by talking to all opposition parties that Sonia Gandhi should form a committee of some leaders from all parties for the presidential and vice-presidential elections, to coordinate and form opinions among all
 Will work ' sutron ke mutabik, sharad pavaar ko is cameti ke pramukh pad kaa apher diya jayega, saath hi isamen seetaram yechuri ko bhi rakhaa jayega
 Mamta and Nitish are being talked about, that they either become part of the committee themselves or make their representative

 Police have arrested five people in the case of shooting at a woman in Ashok Vihar area of northwest Delhi
 mahila par goli us vakt chalaai gai jab vah apane bhattije ke saath car main ghar laut rahi thi
 The woman is injured in this incident
 police ne somvaar ko is baat kii jaankaree di he
 Police say the woman was targeted due to competition in the business
 police ne is vaardaat main shaamil sabhi paanch aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya he
 Police said the three accused who opened fire on the woman have been identified as Saurabh Rana (19), Prince Khasa (19) and Danish Bali (19), while two other accused who helped in the conspiracy were identified as Raj Kumar Verma (46) and Ravi Goyal (28)

 varsh 2007 kaa ajmer sharif visphot hinduon ko dargah par jane se rokane ke liye kattarpathiyon ke ek aise samooh ne kiya jisamen bahusankhyak or alpsankhyak donon samudaayon ke sadsy shaamil the
 This disclosure was made by Swami Aseemanand, an accused in the case, in his confession statement
 aseemanand ne apane bayaan main kaha ‘ajmer visphot ke kuch din baad sunil joshi (aresas kaa purv prachaarak jisaki hatya kar di gai) mere paas aayaa
 He was accompanied by two more men named Raj and Mehul
 vah kai maukon par shabari dham kii yatra bhi kar chukaa tha
 In the statement, Aseemanand said, "joshi claimed that his people had carried out the bombing and that he was also present at the Ajmer dargah during the blast
" usne kaha ki indresh kumaar (aresas ke varisht netaa) ne bam rakhane ke liye use do muslim ladke muhaiyaa karaae the
 'this statement was made before a magistrate under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure (CRPC), which is valid in the court
 visphoton ke liye dargah ke chayan ke bare main swami aseemanand ne kaha, ‘ajmer sharif aisi dargah he jahaan hindu bhi badi sankhya main jate hai
 For this reason, we placed a bomb in Ajmer so that the Hindus would stop going there in fear
 ’ aseemanand ne apane bayaan main aresas ke kai sadasyon or uski kendriya samiti ke sadsy indresh kumaar kii maalegaanv, hyderabad or samjhauta express visphoton main bhoomika kaa bhi zikr kiya
 He claimed that Indresh met him in 2005 and said that the task of planting the bomb was not his (aseemanand's) and that he had appointed Joshi for it
 unhone kaha, ‘indreshji 2005 main shabari dham (gujarat main aseemanand kaa ashram) main mujhase mili
 He was accompanied by several senior RSS officials
 
 He told me that the discussion of 'bomb for bomb' is not my business
 unhone kaha ki aresas ne mujhe adivasee logon ke bich kaam karne kaa nirdesh diya he or usase zyada kuch nahin karne ko kaha he
 He said that they are also thinking like me and hence Sunil (joshi) has been given the responsibility and he will be given every help
 ’ aseemanand ne desh main mandiron main aatanki hamalon ke pratishodh ke taur par ‘‘bam ke badale bam’’ kaa prastaav kiya tha
 In Aseemanand's statement, however, it has been said that the right-wing extremists who carried out several blasts did not trust each other very much
 bharat or pakistan ke bich chalane vaali samjhauta express main 2007 main hue visphoton main 68 se zyada log maare gaye the jabaki 2008 ke maalegaanv visphoton main saat or 2007 ke ajmer dargah visphoton main teen logon kii maut ho gayi thi
 Aseemanand confessed to talking about the special mark and providing funds for it
 lekin visphoton ke bare main unhen jaankaree ghatana ke baad mili
 He took another accused in the Malegaon blast case
 karnal shrikant purohit ke bare main bhi baat kii jo giraftaar ke samay sena kii khufia shakha main niyukt the
 Aseemanand said in a statement recorded on December 18 last year, 'colonel Purohit also told me that Indreshji is an ISI agent and he has all the documents
 lekin purohit ne mujhe vah dastavej kabhi nahin dikhaaya
 Indresh was questioned by the CBI in the Mecca Masjid blast case and he is likely to be questioned again

 In the 20-member CADC election, Congress won seven seats and BJP five
 vahiin mizo neshnal front (emenef) ne sabase adhik aath siton par kabja jamaaya tha
 In such a situation, local leaders of both parties formed an alliance after the election and named it United Legislature Party
 iske baad chakma swytt jila parishad par kabja jamaaya tha
 However, no announcement was made by the national leadership, which was made by the regional leaders of Mizoram at their level
 iske baad congress-bijepi ne milakar sthaneey chunaav bhi ladaa tha
 BJP-PDP in Jammu and Kashmir After the 2014 Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections, the BJP formed an alliance with the People's Democratic Party (PDP) of the late Mufti Muhammad Saeed and his daughter Mehbooba Mufti Saeed
 jabaki, bijepi or pidipi ek duusare kii vipareet vicharadhar ke maane jate the
 The BJP has long been accusing the PDP of being a party to separatism
 iske baavjood us samay jammu-kashmir ke bijepi prabharee ram madhav ne sarkaar banane ke liye pidipi ke saath gathjod kiya tha
 However, this alliance could last only till 2018 and the BJP and PDP parted ways

 The BJP emerged as the single largest party, but stayed away from the majority figure
 aise main bijepi ko satta se baahar rakhane ke liye congress or jedies ne milakar sarkaar banaai thi
 In such a situation, HD Kumaraswamy, the leader of the JDS party who stood at number three, became the Chief Minister
 haalanki congress or jedies ke kuch vidhayakon kii baghawat ke chalate congress-jedies kii sarkaar gir gai
 These are also unmatched alliances, in this way the BJP formed a government in Uttar Pradesh several times with the BSP

 iske baad basapa 1995 main alag ho gai thi
 During this, SP mlas attacked the guest house where Mayawati stayed
 iske baad 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mayawati or sapa ek baar phir saath aae, lekin chunaav nattejey ke baad phir donon kii raah juda ho gai

 As a result, 2017 again separated from each other

 ' saal 2017 main bitakwine chaaya rahaa
 The price of bitcoin rose a lot and at one time it reached 13 lakh rupees, so that from investors to economists could not live without being affected by it
 haalanki, iske baad isaki keemat ghatakar kareeb aadhi ho chuki he
 But while Bitcoin is being considered as a bad name, its basic technology 'blockchain' is being considered revolutionary for the future economy
 blockchen kii lokapriyata pichley saal hi badhani shuru ho gai he, lekin aisa mana ja rahaa he ki yah banking se lekar, aadhaar or chunaav pranali tak bhavishya ke bharat main krantikari badlaav laa sakati he
 What is blockchainblockchains are actually decentralized digital ledgers that form the basis of all types of crypto currencies
 digital soochnaaon ko copy nahin balki vitarit karne kii suvidha se blockchen technology ne nae tarah ke internet kaa aadhaar taiyaar kiya he
 Although it was invented for digital currency bitcoin, but now it has started focusing on other types of usage
 distributed public lager ke rup main kaary karte hue blockchen lenden kaa ek vikendrit or paardarshee tarika uplabdh karata he or isamen suraksha kaa str bhi kaaphi ooncha hota he
 Experts say that it is not just digital currency but it is much further than that
 yah internet se paraspar judi duniya main or vistaar kar saktaa he
 What are the advantages? The advantage of pairing of internet and blockchain will be that it will reduce the risk of hacking of data, because it will be able to store data through a chain of millions of computers
 blockchen kii ek pramukh visheshta yah hoti he ki yah vikendrit prakruti kaa hota he
 Unlike the technology currently used to keep records in banks, healthcare, government agencies, no intermediary is required to change the ledgers in the blockchain
 kisi blockchen main har yujar apane personal block kaa castodian hota he or jab bhi kisi block main badlaav kiya jaataa he to lager main apane aap badlaav ho jaataa he
 But if any other fake person wants to change it and the information entered by him about a block does not match, then the laser will not update
 is vajah se yah technology kaaphi surakshit he
 The blockchain is still in its early stages, but efforts to mainstream it have begun
 krypto karencys ke alaava kai tarah ke udyogon main blockchen technology ke istemaal kaa pareekshan shuru ho gaya he
 The banking sector is at the forefront
 jaalsaji se bachane or apane kaarobaar main behatari ke liye agle varshon main zyada se zyada bank blockchen kaa istemaal karenge
 Many banks abroad are testing blockchain-based cryptocurrency for money transfer
 america ke mani transfar diggaj manigram ne is bare main ripal se samjhauta kiya he
 It is believed that technology like blockchain based Ripple will reduce the time of cross border money transfer to just 2 to 3 seconds
 laagat or samay bachaane ke liye banking ke alaava duusare kai sector bhi blockchen technology kaa pareekshan shuru kar chuke hai
 What will change in India Blockchain technology can affect many things in our daily lives due to its decentralized nature
 yah technology kaaphi tej, surakshit or kifayati he
 Therefore in digitization it can prove to be quite suitable for government departments in countries like India
 aadhaar jaisi digital aadhaarit suvidhaon main blockchen technology kaaphi madadgaar ho sakati he
 There has been a lot of hue and cry about data leaks in Aadhaar, but the use of blockchain can solve this problem
 aadhaar kaa data vikendrit hota he, lekin blockchen technology se iske galat haathon main padane kii sambhaavna kam ho jaaegi
 Efforts have also started in this regard
 bijness line akhbaar kii ek khabar ke anusaar karnataka sarkaar ne blockchen technology ke istemaal kaa nirnay liya he or vah iske shashan main istemaal par shwetapatr bhi laane vaali he
 Reduction in election expenses: Blockchain technology can bring revolutionary changes in the world of voting in India
 ek anumaan ke anusaar saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 3,424 karod rupee kharch hue the, lekin agar bhavishya ke chunaav main blockchen technology kaa istemaal hua to chunaav kharch kam ho jaaenge or yah kaaphi surakshit bhi ho jayega
 With the use of this technology, there will be no forgery in the case of voters
 yahi nahin, aisi vyavastha bhi banaai ja sakati he, jisamen voter apane ghar se hi apanemobile sehi vot daal sake

 haalanki, iske saath hi unhone kaha ki spectrum nilaamee prakriya puri hone se pehle daron main badhotaree nahin hogi

 gujarat ke agle mukhyamantri ke naam par suspence se pardaa uthaate hue bhartiya janata party ne maujuuda mukhyamantri vijay roopaani par muhar laga di he
 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who was responsible for the search for a new Chief Minister, announced Rupani's name and said that this time he will be accompanied by Nitin Patel in Gujarat as Deputy Chief Minister
 party main sutron kaa maananaa he ki rupani ko ek baar phir mukhyamantri pad kii jimmedaari dekar yah sandesh dene kii koshish kii gai he ki roopaani ke netritv main rajya kii sarkaar ne acha kaam kiya he
 Therefore, the party has given a clear message to the state that once again the development of the state will be given priority under the leadership of Rupani and Patel
 haalanki jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki is baar rajya main bijepi sarkaar ke liye rajya kii satta itani aasaan nahin he or kai nai chunautiya netritv kii is jodi ko gherne ke liye rajya main taiyaar hai
 New challenges before the BJP government in Gujarat
 Popularizing BJP in villages: The most important challenge before Vijay Rupani and Nitin Patel is to strengthen the party's position in the rural areas of the state
 beete chunaavon main jis tarah party ne gramin ilaakon main apni pakad congress ke haath khoi he usase kendriya netritv sakate main hai
 At the same time, in the wake of the 2019 general elections, Rupani and Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel, who are once again becoming chief ministers, will have to bring rural areas under the Gujarat model of development
 party ne is chunaav main gujarat ke chaar bade shaharon main hi sarvaadhik siten jiti hai
 Reducing the resentment of the Patels In the results of the Assembly elections, the reason for the party being reduced to just 99 seats is considered to be the resentment of the Patels on the issue of reservation
 jis tarah hardi patel or congress party ne prachaar ke dauraan patel samudaay ko bijepi se alag karne kii muhim chhedi he, party alaakaman ko 2019 ke liye khatre kii ghanti sunai de rahi he
 Therefore, by placing Nitin Patel at the helm of leadership along with Vijay Rupani, the party has given responsibility to both to compensate for the loss in the Patel vote bank so that they do not have to face the resentment of the Patel community in 2019
 ise bhi padhein: haar rahe the gujarat, jetali ne lagaaya ye daanv or jeet gaye modi2019 main bijepi kaa kila bachaanavidhansabha chunaavon congress ke khate main badi siton ne bijepi ko kila ganvaane kaa ahsaas kara diya he
 Whereas in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP has won all the seats in the state and strengthened Narendra Modi as Prime Minister
 lekin vidhansabha chunaavon main congress ke achche pradarshan se ek baar phir chunauti 2019 main piem modi ko majboot karne ke liye rajya kii sabhi loksabhaa siton par jeet hasil karne kii he
 In 2014, the party swept all 26 seats, clearing the Congress sweep
 aise main 2019 main ek seat bhi kam hone par party kii saakh par batta lag saktaa he
 Dealing with the already strong opposition in the assembly, Narendra Modi himself was leading the state during three of the last four terms of the BJP government in Gujarat
 us dauraan lagaataar rajya main congress ek kamjor vipaksh kii bhoomika main rahi
 But after Vijay Rupani's previous BJP government, the party was in serious danger of losing power due to antincombency
 lekin kisi tarah party kii saakh bachaane main kaamyaab hone ke baad bhi bijepi kii nai sarkaar ke saamne vidhansabha main ek majboot vipaksh ke taur par congress party maujuud rahegi
 Therefore, this government will have to face the vocal opposition of the Congress in setting policies for the state through the assembly
 is baar bhaajapa ko vidhansabha main pehle se zyada majboot vipaksh milegaa
 This is also a big challenge for the party
 yuva netaaon ko apane tajurbe se peeche chhodnaarajya kii nai vidhansabha main vipaksh ke khemen se bijepi sarkaar ke liye ek raahat he haalanki iskaa phayda uthaane ke liye use apane tajurbe kaa sahaara lenaa hoga
 The Congress has most of the mlas in the Assembly who have won the election for the first time
 haalanki yah nae netaa janata ke bich mukhar rahe or chunaav main bijepi ke nuksaan kaa kaaran bhi bane
 But senior and more experienced BJP leaders in the Assembly will have to work behind leaving these young faces of the Congress
 yadi bijepi kii yah nai sarkaar is kaam ko karne main vifal hoti he to 2019 main ye chehre unke liye badi pareshaani lekar aa sakate hai
 Many youngsters like alpesh-jignesh have arrived in the House
 aise main is yuva shakti kaa bhi party ko saamana karnaa padegaa

 But the agency refused them, saying that the British and Europeans would be taken into consideration for these white children

 The British media raised this issue of apartheid in the adoption of the child with great importance

 Explain that on August 22, the Supreme Court had banned three divorces
 shaayara bano maamle main sunwaayee karte hue supreme court ne ek samay main ek saath teen talaak ke khilaaf faisla diya tha
 The Central Government is pursuing the matter to make the Supreme Court's decision against triple talaq more effectively
 sarkaar teen talaak ke khilaaf kanoon banane kaa faisla kiya he
 The government is considering amending the existing penal provisions, under which if a person gives triple talaq, it would be an offense
 supreme court ke teen talaak ke khilaaf faisle ko or bhi prabhavi tareeke se banane ke liye centre sarkaar is maamle ko aage badha rahi he
