 The prose and criticism was that his articles were being published in almost all the reputed literary journals of that time
 sahitya kii duniya or sampadakon kii najar main vah aa chuke the
 But even then he himself did not know that the world of literature is calling him himself as a sharp editor
 angreji ke lekhak, patrkaar amitabh ghosh ko milegaa 54waan gyanpith awordsdarasal hua yon ki usee dauraan madhya pradesh sarkaar ko madhya pradesh sahitya parishad main khaali hue sachiv ke pad ke liye kisi upyukt vyakti kii talash hui
 a person who can handle the post of secretary as well as editing 'interview' magazine
 shashan se iske liye bulaava aane par unhone sankoch ke saath pratiniyukti par madhya pradesh sahitya parishad ke sachiv pad kii bagdor sambhaal lee
 For the first time he left the teaching environment and got involved in administrative field and editing
 saahitiyik patrika ‘saakshaatkaar’ inase pehle prasiddh kathakaar gulsher khan shaani ke sampadan me nikalati thi
 Becoming editor of interviews after Shani was no laughing matter
 shrotiy kaa puraa vajood daanv par lag gaya
 They had little contact with writers, creators
 kaaphi vakt laga
 The first issue of his editorship came out with a lot of delay, but when it came out he left a different impression on him
 pehle ank se hi vah ek safal sahitya sampadak ke rup main sthapit ho chuke the
 While on the post of Secretary of Madhya Pradesh Sahitya Parishad, he got it free from the pressure of Madhya Pradesh Arts Council
 saakshaatkaar ke sampadan se virat hone ke baad vah ek baar phir adhyaapan se jude or kuch antaraal par madhya pradesh rashtrabhasha parishad kii patrika akshara bhi nikaali
 But not many days
 saal 1995 main unhone kolkata main aakar bhartiya bhashaa parishad kii patrika ‘vagarth’ kaa pehla ank nikaala
 Wagarth's first issue was enough to establish his editorial talent and imprint
 patrika bhartiya bhashaa parishad ke sansthaapakon seetaram secosaria or bhagirath canodia kii soch ke sarvatha anukool thi
 After a long time in Bangladeshi metropolis Kolkata, the flag of Hindi literature was once again unfurled
 desh- videsh ke rachanaakaar, lekhak, kathakaar, sameekshak, kavi vagarth se judane lage the
 The fame of the council and Wagarth reached far and wide during his tenure
 isaki vajah thi
 His enthusiasm for new writers was always visible

 During his editorship, Wagarth neither made himself a full-fledged professional, nor did he let the gardener fall short like miniature magazines
 yah patrika donon ke bich ek pul par khadi ho sirf sahitya kaa yashogaan, uskaa utsav manaa rahi thi, ek vakt jisamen chapana har sahityakar ke liye maan kii baat ho gai thi
 Wagarth drew many collectible specials
 yah prayog vah jahaan bhi rahe, jari rahaa, nayaa gyanoday main bhi or samakaleen bhartiya sahitya main bhi
 In Wagarth, he published a lot from reputed writers to young and new creators
 kisi vichaardhaara athwa kheme se na bandhakar vagarth ko sabaki saahitiyik patrika banaaya
 Prabhakar Shrotiya was the editor of Wagarth and director of the Indian Language Council till March 2002
 yah unke shram, saahas, sampadan, patibaddhta or duuradrushti hi thi ki vagarth saahitiyik lagaav or samast vidhaon kii sammanit patrika ban gai
 Be it Akshara, Interview, Wagarth, Naya Gyanodaya or Contemporary Indian Literature, as the editor of all these journals, he protected the self-esteem and fame of himself as well as colleagues, writers, readers

 Its story is of Allahabad background
 bamphaad shabd uttar bharat main bahut femes he
 This word describes the characters of our film and about them
 bataa den ki film kab relies hogi iskaa abhi pataa nahin chal paaya he
 There are four lakh telecom towers in India at the moment, but the rate of growth is only 3%, which is associated with this industry every year
 2 karod graahakon kii tulana main bahut hi kam he
 Telecom service providers say that there is an "atmosphere of fear of health effects" among people
 lihaaja, adhik sankhya main atirikt tower nahin lagaae ja sakate
 What is the reality of the matter? a 2012 report by the bio-enitiative indicated that radiation from cellphone towers posed a threat to health
 inamen sabase aam dushprabhav hai neend na aana, sirdard, khiz, ekaagratha main dikkat, smritilop, avsaad, sunne main dikkat or jodon kii samasya
 Among these, the risk of seizures, paralysis, miscarriage, permanent impotence, and cancer are said in more serious diseases
 iity bombai ke electrical ejineering vibhaag main professor girish kumaar bataate hai ki adhiktar deshon main vikiran ke maanak bahut nimna hai
 For example, radiation limits in Austria are 1 milliwatt per square meter
 rus, china, italy or poland jaise deshon main isaki sweekrut seemaa 100 millivot prati varg meter he
 Kumar says, "mobile coverage is possible in these countries, so there is no reason why we cannot keep the radiation levels low in our country
 ”mumbai main cellphone toweron se hone vaale vikiran ke dushprabhavon ke khilaaf virodh pradarshnon kaa ek silsilaa chalaa tha
 The protests erupted when film actress Juhi Chawla took the step of removing the mobile tower just in front of her house in Malabar Hill, Mumbai, and got the support of the people, after which the help of political activists, with the help of cell phones towers Only a movement arose against him
 unki maang thi ki doorsanchaar companiyaan rihaishi ilaakon ke nikat vikiran ke str ko kam rakhen, antina kii sankhya kii ek seemaa tay karen or toweron ko imaaraton se dur lagaaein
 In the meantime, a report came on the ill effects of radiation
 masalan, dadar kii parsi colony sthit shri samarth building ke nivaasiyon ne daawa kiya ki unhone sirf teen saal ke bheetar vahaan cancer ke chah maamle dekhe hai jo kathith taur par us ilaake main lage doorsanchaar toweron ke vikiran se paidaa hue the
 In any case, the relationship between cancer and the tower could not be established, but it caused a sudden sensation in government circles
 doorsanchaar vibhaag ne 2014 main mumbai sthit apane doorsanchaar pravartan sansaadhan or nigaraanee prakoshth ke madhyam se vikiran ke str par ek adhyayan karavaaya
 It addressed public grievances and assured that the telecom operators were indeed following the proposed standards on radiation
 kendriya doorsanchaar mantri ravishankar prasad ne bhi india today ko bataaya ki aise koi nirnaayak adhyayan maujuud nahin hai jo sabit kar saken ki in toweron se hone vaale vikiran se sehat ko khatra hota he
 The American Cancer Society, a non-profit organization, says that the radiation levels from cellphone towers are low because the towers are elevated from the ground and the signals emanating from them are transmitted periodically
 sosayadi kaa kahana he ki jab tak koi sidhe antina ke saamne na aa jaae, us par vikiran kaa dushprabhav bahut simit hoga

 In his 26-minute and 13-second address on the 28th August in Vigyan Bhawan, Delhi, at the duly inauguration of the scheme, Modi said, 'one thing in my speech of August 15, TV channels and newspapers did not pay much attention
 lekin ek sajjan ne aakar mujhe bataaya ki unke driver ne unase kaha ki modiji ne jandhan ke madhyam se ham jesegarybon ko ek lakh rupeka beemaa de diya
 Now my life is safe
 'is yojana kii kamyaabi ke liye pradhanmantri ne 7 lakh bank adhikariyon ko patr likhe, ek din main 77,000 camp lagavaaye or ek hi din main dedh karod logon ke khate bhi khulavaa die
 At the end of the speech, Modi said, 'now the poor man will get away from the cycle of interest, avoid suicide and live a life of happiness
 'sarkaar kaa ek saal puraa hone par pradhanmantri ne 25 may ko mathura raily main bhi jandhan yojana ko garibi hataane kii disha main badi kamyaabi bataaya
 The figures that the government brought out were the opening of more than 15 crore Jan Dhan accounts in the country and depositing Rs 17,000 crore in these accounts was the biggest achievement
 lekin aakhir kitne logon ko jandhan yojana main karj mila, kitne logon ko durghatana beemaa or jivan beemaa kaa laabh mila, jisaki aas main karodon logon ne bainkon kaa rukh kiya tha
 The government is silent on these figures, while it is to be known from these figures whether the people who opened the account in Jan Dhan got any benefit or the crowd of crores broke up in the same way
 vitt mantralay ke sutron ke mutabik 2014 ke ant tak mahaj 40,000 khaataa dharak hi overdraft ke liye aavedan kar sake or inamen se 8,000 logon ko overdraft suvidha di jaaegi
 Similarly, only 108 people were given accident insurance and 152 people were given the benefit of life insurance
 is tarah khataadharakon ke anupaat main labhaarthiyon kii sankhya dekhen to vah shunya fisadi ke kareeb baithti he
 On the other hand, if we look at the current financial year, then the situation is worse
 is saal jandhan kii beemaa vyavastha dekh rahi new india eshyarens company ke mumbai sthit mukhyalay ke ek varisht adhikari ne india today ko bataaya, 'chaalu vitt varsh main beemaa ke liye 14 aavedan aae
 Three of these applications were returned due to the previous financial year and the other three applications were returned for not using the Rupee Card for 45 days
 shesh 8 beemaa clem par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 'these 14 claims have come in a country where every year more than 1 lakh people die only in road accidents
 rupaya card ek kism kaa debit card he jo jandhan yojana main khaataa khulwaane waalon ko diya jaataa he
 After all, why are there so few beneficiaries in a scheme with crores of account holders? Defending this question, Rajesh Aggarwal, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Mission Director of Jan Dhan Yojana, says, "300 to 400 people got the benefit of insurance in the last financial year
 yojana kii ghoshnaa agast ke ant main hui
 It took time to give the PIN number to the account holders
 beemaa kaa laabh dene kii prakriya vyaavhaarik rup se disambar main chaalu hui
 That is why these figures are less visible
 'jab unase poocha gaya ki 45 din tak card swap na hone ke kaaran beemaa aavedan khaarij ho rahe hai, jabaki log to yah maan rahe the ki jandhan kaa khaataa khulaa or unki kismat badal jaaegi, lekin log overdraft ke liye taras rahe hai
 Agarwal admits, 'in the initial form of the plan, prohibitive things were more, now they are being replaced
 isiilie pradhanmantri ne jo do nai beemaa yojanaayen shuru kii hai, unamem pehle se kahin zyada log paatr honge or laabh paanaa bhi aasaan he
 However, it is not clear here that when the period of opening accounts in Jan Dhan was only from 15 August 2014 to 26 January 2015, how the government is considering new insurance schemes as part of Jan Dhan without increasing the period
 vaise na ke baraabar logon ko yojana kaa laabh milane kii asal vajah jandhan yojana kii website par prakashit apaatr logon ke criteria main chhipi he
 Under this, any type of serving or retired government employee, person filing income tax return, TDS paying person will not be eligible for Jan Dhan
 isi tarah chaahe ek ghar main kitne bhi logon ne khate khulwaaye hon, lekin 30,000 ru
 Only the head of the family will get the benefit of life insurance, even if he fulfills the conditions mentioned above
 iske alaava vah pehle se bank kii kisi beemaa yojana kaa labhaarthi na ho
 So didn't banks know these things while opening an account? In response, a senior Punjab National Bank official in Uttar Pradesh smiles, "if a man is coming to open an account in the bank and the KYC rules have been made easy for him, then why would a bank official refuse him?" If all the members of the same family are opening their Jan Dhan account, then we will ask a little whether you are opening the account in the greed of insurance, loan or other government help? Whether the person opening the Jan Dhan account would be entitled to the benefit of insurance was not a concern of banks from the beginning
 bainkon ko to beemaa clem beemaa company ko forward karnaa tha, uskaa manjuur hona yaa naa hona beemaa company or peedit kaa sirdard tha
 Yes, banks were worried that the accounts of zero balance should not become a burden for them
 iske liye bainkon ne do sidhe tareeke nikaale
 The first way states a senior official of State Bank of India, Indore, "banks made an undisclosed policy not to give overdrafts
 ' or agar dena bhi pad jaae to chah maheene tak bank main rahe ausat balance ke baraabar overdraft diya jayega
 According to Finance Ministry sources, where banks had to give overdrafts, the average draft of Rs 2,500 has been given
 bainkon ke duusare tareeke kaa zikr karte hue jhaansi se pienbi ke ek adhikari bataate hai, 'har khate ke sanchaalan ke liye vyaavhaarik rup se bank ko kuch na kuch laagat aati he
 Suppose if someone's passbook is lost, then a new passbook will have to be given
 aise main agar jiro balance khaataa hua to yah paise kahaan se katenge
 So the bank motivated people to deposit money in the account
 ' isi kaa asar he ki jan dhan ke khaaton main 17,000 karod rupee jamaa ho gaye
 This money currently became a gift for the banking sector
 is sthiti kaa bachaav karte hue vitt rajya mantri jayant sinha kehete hai, 'over draft isliye kam logon ko mil rahaa he kyonki bank pehle yah dekhegaa ki chah maheene tak khaataa sahi dhang se chalaa yaa nahin
 The customer will be given approval to issue an overdraft only after viewing the credit history
 'yani bank or vitt rajya mantri donon hi maan rahe hai ki jandhan main khaataa khulwaanaa bank se karj milane kii guarantee nahin he
 To get a loan, you have to fulfill the basic conditions of the bank
 is par tanj karte hue uttar pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh nirmal khatri kehete hai, 'suut-boot kii sarkaar to un companiyon se bhi zyada chhalaava kar rahi he jo niyam or sharten bahut maheen aksharon main neeche likh detii hai
 Here, crores of accounts were opened in trust of the Prime Minister's tongue and later the terms and conditions were imposed in fine letters
 agar logon ko pehle se yah baaten pataa hotin to ve khate khulavaate hi nahin
 'so what is the way now? On this question, Aggarwal says, 'the initial prohibitive conditions of the scheme are being removed after practical difficulties
 ' itani badi aabaadi ko jodne vaali yojana main vyaavhaarik dikkaton ke hisaab se badlaav jaruri hai
 That is why it is now being called as Jan Suraksha Yojana by not restricting the entire scheme to Jan Dhan Yojana
 isamen atal pension yojana, jan suraksha yojana kii donon beemaa yojanaon ko bhi vrihattar yojana kaa hissaa maan liya gaya he
 Sinha explains, 'mobile numbers, Aadhaar cards and bank accounts are the three foundation stones for connecting people to the financial system
 ye teenon chijen milakar logon ko vittiya vyavastha se jodne kaa dhaancha khadaa karengi or logon ko garibi ke dushchakr se nikaalengi
 That is, by the time the specifics of the Jan Dhan Yojana came to light and people came out to take stock of its profit and loss, the government further complicated this assessment by adding new schemes
 philhan nai beemaa yojanaayen shuru hui hai or inaki beemaa policy saamne aane ke baad hi pataa chalegaa ki asal main inamen he kya
 At present, people have started engaging in new schemes of public safety with the same enthusiasm as they were associated with Jan Dhan six-seven months ago
 aise main sarkaar ko yah to sunishchit karnaa hi hoga ki vah koun-si yojana hogi jo logon ko vaaki ve vaade muhaiyaa kara sake jo pradhanmantri ke robeele bhaashanon main prakat hote hai
 As it is, confusion is spreading among people by adding one scheme to another and repeated amendments
 aakhir 2011 main manmohan singh sarkaar kii taraf se bhi aisi hi yojana shuru hui thi
 Then villages with a population of more than 2000 had to be connected to the bank, now every house has to be connected
 jandhan shuru karte samay hi sarkaar ne apane dastavejon main mana tha ki yah yojana puraani yojana kaa vistaar he
 In such a situation, the outcome of Jan Dhan should not be like the old plan and after listening to Modi ji's speech, the trust of the driver who believes that his life is safe, should not be broken, for that the government will have to climb uphill
 bihar ke mukhyamantri jeethanram maanjhi buudhvaar ko apane damaad devendra kumaar ko apana nijee sahaayak niyukt kiye jane ko lekar vivaad main ghir gaye or mukhyamantri ke is faisle par kadi pratikriyaayein aane ke baad kumaar ne pad se istipha de diya
 Kumar, who was appointed Manjhi's personal assistant (PA), said tonight, "I have sent my resignation to the Chief Secretary's personal secretary
 ’’ unhone kaha ki log unki niyukti par sawaal uthaa rahe the isliye unhone istipha de diya
 Earlier, Manjhi had appointed Kumar as his PA and another relative as Adeshpal, strongly condemning the BJP for breaking the rules on the Chief Minister

 In the said notification signed by the then Secretary of the Cabinet Secretariat Department, Girish Shankar, it was also said that it is felt that if a Minister, Minister of State or Deputy Minister is appointed as his relative or private personnel, then the government Work is feared to be affected
 adhisuchana main yah bhi kaha gaya tha ki sarkaar ne yah bhi nirnay liya he ki yadi kisi maamle main sage-sambandhi kii niyukti ho gai ho to use tatkaal samaapt kar diya jaae
 When asked about this after a meeting of the Council of Ministers held at the old Secretariat in Patna today, he said, "we keep accusing people like this
" yah koi mudda nahin he
 When journalists said that this was a violation of a government order of 2000, Manjhi said, "he will see it
" ’ Reacting to the matter, senior BJP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi had said that it reflected how much corruption is prevalent in the JDU government

 varnika ne car ko said de diya
 But is this car stopped in front of Varnika's car? usamen se do ladke neeche utre
 Began to grow like a ring
 usne ladako kaa iraadaa bhaanp liya
 Reverse the car and started running
 un donon manchalon ne varnika kaa peechha karnaa shuru kar diya
 There is no one else to follow Varnika but Vikas Barala, son of Haryana BJP President Subhash Barala and a friend of his
 usne sochaa ki vah apane pita ke rutabe kii dhauns main sadak par kisi ladki ko agava kar legaa, lekinvarnika ne apni bahadurise usko neechata kaa ehsaas kara diya

 tulsidasanandakishor navalrajakmal prakaashan, dariyaganj, nai dilli-2keemtah 200 ru
 Bhaktikal is considered the golden age of Hindi literature
 tulsidas bhaktikaal ke kavi hai
 The well-known critic Nandkishore Naval has elaborated on the relevance of Tulsidas in his work in the present day
 ve ab tak aadhunik kavita par likhte rahe hai
 In this book, he has made the subject of a poet of Middle Ages for the first time
 swabhaavatah aisa unhone apni antahprerana se kiya he
 Consequently, in his book, the archetypal critic meets a raspy reader rather than a critic
 iske teen lekhon ke jariye tulsidas kii kavita kaa sampurna chitra ankhon ke saamne aa jaataa he
 The picture is as much as the phosphor, the same the succulent
 iske bal par tulsidas kaa kavi-chitra bhi vishaal se vishaaltar hota jaataa he
 In the first article of the book, Naval has highlighted the major poems of Tulsidas
 isamen ramalala nahachhu ko tulsi kii pehali rachana bataaya gaya he
 Apart from this, the features of Ramagna question, Janaki Mangal, Parvati Mangal, Geetavali, Krishna Geetavali, Barvai Ramayana, Dohavali, Kavitavali and Hanumanbaak are also mentioned
 kaha jaataa he ki barbai ramayana kii rachana tulsi ne abdurrahim khaankhaana ke kavy barbai nayikabhed se prerit hokar kii
 Rahim was also his friend and he probably sent that poem to him
 is kriti main sita kaa rup-varnan bahut kuch vaise hi kiya gaya he, jaise ve reetikalin nayika hon
 The story of Parvatimangal is of Kumarasambhavam of Kalidas
 acharya ramchandra shukla ne likhaa he ki tulsidas ke mansetar avadhi kavy main vahi mithaas milti he, jo jaaysi ke padmavat main
 The second article highlights Tulsidas's strong Kirti-pillar Ramcharit Manas
 isi ke bal par ve bharat ke hi nahin, sansar ke mahan kaviyon main gine jate hai
 George Grierson, on seeing its popularity, called him the greatest Loknayak after Buddhadev
 kavi-kulguru kalidas ne apane mahakavy raghuvansham kaa samaarambh jis shloke se kiya he, usamen ve vagarth kii prapti ke liye us shiv or parvati kii stuti karte hai, jo vaak or arth kii tarah sanyukt hai
 Unlike this, Tulsidas has started Manas with Saraswati and Ganesh Vandana
 vah isliye ki saraswati vidya kii adhishthatri devi hai or ganesh vidya-vaaridhi buddhi vidhaataa hai
 Pandey Bechan Sharma Sharma 'ugra' says that i have not read a lot of the best literature in the world but i do not regret it because i have read Ramcharit Manas
 antim lekh main naval ne vinayapatrika ko chunaa he
 Some scholars of Tulsi literature consider Vinayapatrika as his masterpiece
 iske stotron main tulsi kaa viraat kavitv prakat hua he, jo hindi kaviyon ke liye ek chunauti bhi he
 Most of the verses in its Vinaya section are usually written in simple language
 tulsidas kii yah badi visheshta he ki ve abhivyakti ko saral or sampreshnty banaate hue bhi use abhijaat str se neeche nahin aane dete
 An insightful book is interesting, useful and readable

 According to BJP leader Sushil Modi, many people have given crores of gifts to his family from servant to leader
 susheel modi ne sawaal uthaaya tha ki aakhir lalu parivaar ko hi itane uphaar kyon milte hai, jabaki lalu prasad kehete hai ki bijepi netaaon ko uphaar nahin milte, isliye jalnavash ve aisi baat karte hai
 According to BJP leaders, the gifts given to the Lalu family are as follows: Gift of one crore to Hema Yadav The land of nearly Rs 1 crore was donated to Hema Yadav, wife and daughter of Prasad Yadav, in 2014 by her servant Lalan Chaudhary

 iske liye dedh darjan kendriya mantriyon or varisht netaaon ko paanch-paanch siton kaa 'paalak' banaakar abhiyaan chalaaya jayega
 The BJP is now focusing on the 90 seats on which it finished second in 2014, in addition to the 283 seats it won in 2014

 One day, crossing the Sarman River to trade indigo crops, he reaches the nearby big city of Mohenjo Daro where he meets Chani (pooja Hegde), meanwhile, in Mohen Jodro, Maham (kabir Bedi) because of his powers He tries to rule over all with force, in which his son Moonja (arunoday Singh) also has a big hand

 a lot of research has been done behind the story of the scriptfilm, it is understandable, Ashutosh has written the screenplay and Preeti Mamgan has written good dialogues
 bas kahani or uskaa filmakan bahut hi lanbaa lagata he jise chota kiya ja saktaa tha
 After a while, the film starts to look serialized
 film ke fite seqvence, geeton kaa filmakan or loketions kamaal kii hai
 Actress Roshanne has played an amazing role and brought Sarman to life 100 percent, while Pooja Hegde has played a good character of Chani
 manish choudhary, sharad kelkar, nitish bharadwaj, kabir bedi, arunoday singh or baaki sabhi sah kalakaaron ne acha or sahaj abhinay kiya he
 Weak link is a weak story of the film, there is a very long film before and after the interval and after a while there is a moment when you are forced to open the mobile phone and see the message
 sangitafilm kaa sangeet acha he or e aar rahamaan ne acha mujeec compoj kiya he
 Why see if you like Ashutosh Gowariker's movies and if you are a fan of Ritik then you can watch this movie once

 I'm traveling to London from Mumbai via @jetairways and i had the most horrible experience with the CISF staff
 After scanning my wheelchair, this insensitive woman was forcing me to stand up, even when i told her repeatedly that i couldn't
 Pt
 1she kept forcing me to stand up and then she went on to say that she'd lift me up and get someone else to pat my backside
 After many denied requests, she lifted my leg up forcefully, causing a major cramp
 Pt
 2the cramp was so painful, that my leg went into a spasm which made it cramp even more
 i wanted to file a complaint about the way she treated me, but her senior was nowhere in sight
 Is this how the CISF are trained? Pt
 3she was incredible insensitive, and this is NOT how you treat a disabled passenger! Every other international airport has chemical strips to check the wheelchair and shoes, a disabled passenger doesn't need to get out of their wheelchair
 So why in Mumbai's International Airport? CISF women staff was carrying out mandatory pre-embarkation security check and she was polite too during interaction
 On seeing the lady concerned, CISF officers arrived at the spot, pacified her and explained the situation

 But let us say that it is very important for every person to talk to himself
 darasal, khud se baat karne se sehat acchhee bani rahati he saath hi jivan main khushhaali bhi aati he
 This is a great option to motive yourself
 aisa karne se aapkaa tanaav to kam hota hi he saath hi mood bhi fresh hota he
 Let us know the advantages of talking to ourselves
 
 
 - subah uthakar khud se bolen, main khubasurat hoon, main acchhee sehat or khushiyaan paane ke laayak hoon yaa phir main aaj kuch behtareen kaam karuungi / karuunga
 Waking up daily in the morning and speaking to yourself in a loud voice will instill confidence in you
 jisase aap jivan main kuch acha kar paaengen
 - There comes a time in everyone's life when negative thoughts start coming in our mind
 jis kaaran ham khud ko kuch bhi kaam karne ke sakasham nahin samajhate
 At such a time, it is important that you visualize your victory by yourself and say to yourself in a loud voice, 'I will become successful in life \ '
 aisa karne se aap apane kaary ke prati zyadapositive or utsahmahasoos karenge or apane kaam ko acchhee tarah se kar sakengen
 - All people spend most of their time on mobile phones nowadays
 chahen kisi ko fasebuk yaa instagram par massej karnaa ho, email bhejnaa ho yaa game khelnaa ho
 So try to put background inspiring wall paper on your mobile and read it in loud voice whenever you use mobile
 isse aapkaa confidence boost hoga or aap jivan ke prati positive ho jaaenge

 kuch log apane kaam par focus nahin kar pate
 Their attention keeps wandering here and there
 agar aap chaahakar bhi kisi kaam par focus nahin kar pate hai to khud ko aise motivet karen jaise ki aap kisi duusare vyakti ko karte hai
 By doing this, you will be able to achieve success in life by focusing on your work

 sarkaar ne aakhirkaar yah sanket de diya ki vah vipaksh ke dabaav main nahin aegi
 Economist Surjit Bhalla considers FDI voting an important victory in terms of reforms
 unhone kaha ki isse bhi mahatvapurn baat yah he ki isse ''bijepi kii sirf virodh ke liye virodh karne kii ranneeti kaa ant hoga
 "this could allow the party to agree on at least two such reformist bills that he supported during his tenure: increasing the FDI limit in the insurance sector and opening up the pension sector
 in donon hi maamalon main na to retail epadi jaisaa rajnatik vivaad he or na hi donon kaa aam aadmi se koi vyapak judaav he
 The future of both these bills is in the balance since the time of the NDA government
 in par aage baduya is baat kaa ek or sanket hoga ki sarkaar waapas apane kaam par lag gai he
 However, many others are not so optimistic about the future of reforms
 arthshaastri bibek debaroy kehete hai, ''mujhe nahin lagata ki retail kaarobaar par matdaan se baahar rahane vaali partiyaan beemaa or pension main epadi par sarkaar kaa samarthan karengi
 He argues that the real obstacle in the path of high growth rate is not the legislature but the executive
 unhone kaha, ''5
 5 percent to 6
 5 fisadi tak kii growth tak pahunchane ke liye sarkaar ko neshnal investment board ke masale ko hal karnaa hoga or yah dekhnaa hoga ki paryaavaran sambandhi manzooriyaan milane main pal bhar kii bhi deree na ho
 But this is not happening
 iske alaava bada vittiya ghaataa bhi karypalika kaa masalaa he, vidhayika kaa nahin
 “the reform on which the government has to bring both the legislature and the executive into action is land acquisition
 aisa nahin lagata ki sarkaar is masale par koi vyapak aam sahmati banane main sakasham ho paaegi, yah shaayad retail epadi se bhi zyada vivaadit masalaa he
 Till now no consensus has been reached on whether the government should acquire land for the private sector or not even in cases involving 'public purpose'
 isi prakaar is par bhi kuch saaf nahin ho paaya he ki audyogic jaruraton ke liye kheti kii jameen kharidne par uski kya upyukt keemat honi chahie
 At a time when the Congress will not take the risk of moving on the land acquisition bill, it may need the support of coalition parties and opposition parties on its favorite food security bill
 sansad main epadi par hue matdaan ke thodi hi der baad congress pravaktaa raashid alvi ne kaha ki beemaa main epadi kaa masalaa puri tarah se sarkaar ke agenda main he
 But he did not say anything clearly on the land acquisition bill
 alpavadhi main to retail epadi niti kaa jamini str par koi asal asar dikhne vaala nahin he
 The first thing is that only 10 states are allowing FDI in retail business, that too will be limited to cities with more than one million population
 uttar pradesh, bihar, gujarat, madhya pradesh jaise kai bade rajya is niti ko lagu nahin karne ja rahe
 In this way, the size of investment and the fixed amount of supply chain development will be an obstacle from the beginning

 He was second in the order of ministers who took oath after Prime Minister Modi
 bhartiya janata party(bijepi) ke kaddavar netaaon main kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh kaa bhi naam aata he
 At present, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah, he is considered the most powerful and powerful leader in the party
 rajnath singh ke raajnneetik kad kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki atal bihari vaajapeyi or laal krishna adwani ke baad aise netaa hai jo party kii kaman do baar sambhaal chuke hai
 In such a situation, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, people had their eyes on Rajnath Singh
 uttar pradesh kii lakhanu seat par bhartiya janata party (bijepi) pratyaashee or grih mantri rajnath singh gathbandhan kii taraf se lard raheen sapa pratyaashee punam sinha ko kareeb teen lakh 40 hajaar voton se haraakar sansad pahunche hai

 rajnath siyasat main kadam rakhane se pehle mirzapur ke college main professor rahe hai
 But grew up in the Sangh courtyard since childhood
 bijepi ke matra sanghathan ke rup main mashhoor aresas se rajnath kii kareebi jagajaahir he
 His better relationship with the RSS can be gauged from the fact that after Advani's Jinnah episode, the Sangh had entrusted Rajnath as the party's president
 iske baad duusari baar bijepi kii kaman rajnath singh ne tab sanbhali thi jab poorti maamle main nitin gadakari kaa naam saamne aayaa tha
 The interesting thing is that in 2013, Rajnath Singh had stamped the name of Narendra Modi for the post of Prime Minister
 haalanki party ke kai netaa is baat par sahamat nahin the, lekin rajnath singh ne aage aakar unke naam ko badhaayaa he
 Born on 10 July 1951, Rajnath holds a degree in Prostration in Physics from Gorakhpur University
 uske baad 1971 main kebi degree college main vah professor niyukt kiye gaye
 Rajnath Singh, who was jailed for several months during the Emergency, was made the President of Mirzapur district by the Jana Sangh in 1975
 uttar pradesh main shiksha mantri ke taur par kiye gaye kaamon ko lekar aaj bhi rajnath singh kaa faisla kaabil-e-tarif he
 In 1991, he implemented the anti-coping Act as Minister of Education
 saath hi vaidic ganit ko paathyakram main bhi shaamil karwaane kaa shrey unheen ko jaataa he
 Rajnath Singh became the Chief Minister of the state on 20 October 2000
 haalanki unka kaarykaal 2 saal se bhi kam samay ke liye rahaa
 When Vajpayee-led NDA government was formed at the Center, Rajnath Singh was made the Minister of Agriculture
 iske baad 2014 main narendra modi kii sarkaar bani to desh ke grahamantri bane
 He is the second leader in the Modi cabinet
