 The Delhi High Court has reserved its verdict on the PIL filed by Aam Aadmi Party's Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh
 sanjay singh ne piem narendra modi kii sansad main kam upasthiti ko lekar sawaal uthaate hue ye yachika daayar kii he
 During the hearing, the court said that the details of how long PM has been present in the house have not been given in this petition
 saath hi kitne vakt sadan se baahar rahe hai
 Therefore, there is a lack of facts and authentic information about the charge made in that petition
 rajya sabhasaansad sanjay singh ne apni yachikaamein kaha ki sadan main piem kii kam upasthiti kii vajah se janata se jude muddon par uthe sawaal kaa jawaab nahin mil paata
 During the hearing, on behalf of Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Malviya Nagar and lawyer by profession Somnath Bharti, who appeared on behalf of Sanjay Singh, said that till a few days ago the attendance was on the Lok Sabha website
 lekin ab use hataa liya gaya he
 Sanjay Singh's lawyer told the court that PM Modi did not debate in Parliament on the mob lynching in Dadri
 rohit vemula, neerav modi par sansad main koi bahes nahi hui
 PM Modi has been present in Parliament only 19 times in the last 4 years
 unhone janhit ke keval 4 muddon par bahes ke dauraan bhaag liya he
 Only the Speaker of Lok Sabha can tell about these issues but the issues were debated
 hai court ne sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha tha ki ye janhit yachika kyon daakhil kii gai he? court ne ye bhi poocha ki kya piem ke videshi daure kaa koi aankada sanjay singh ke paas maujuud he? jab jawaab nahin main aayaa to court ne kaha ki aap is yachika ko waapas lekar puure tathyon ko ikatta karke dobaaraa yachika laga sakate hai
 But the petitioner's counsel decided to argue it
 sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne kaha ki abhi court band he sirf vekeshan bench baith rahi he
 In such a situation, what is the need for early hearing on this PIL? The Delhi High Court said that in this filed PIL, no detail of pm's presence in Parliament has been given nor any figure has been given

 unhone kaha ki hamane mukhya ayuktaon se kar vasuuli main sahyogaatmak ravaiya apnaane ke liye kaha he
 We have asked the CCIT (chief Commissioner of Income Tax) to continuously instruct all the Commissioners, all Assistant Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners and Income Tax officials
 chidambaram ne kaha ki sarkaar ko maujuuda kaarobaari saal main 5
 The target of 7 lakh crore direct tax collection is expected to be achieved
 vitt mantri ne haalanki kaha ki abhi tak pratyaksh kar kii vasuuli lakshya se kam rahi he lekin maujuuda kaarobaari saal kii duusari chamahi main vasuuli badhegi
 He said that the recovery 10
 5 fisadi kii dar se badi he, jabaki jarurat 15 fisadi kii he
 Chidambaram said that the low rate of economic growth does not mean that the tax collection will also be low, as the two have no relation between themselves
 sarkaar kar or jidipi anupaat 2011-12 ke 10 fisadi se badhaakar 12 fisadi karnaa chaahati he
 This ratio 11 of 2007-08
 9 fisadi se ghatakar 2011-12 main 10
 Had come down to 1 percent
 mantri ne kaha kihamaara lakshya waapas 12 fisadi par pahunchane kaa he
 Even after 12 per cent, India will remain among the countries with the lowest tax-gdp ratio

 View this post on instagramcan’t keep calm!!! Last and final chemo! Fuck yesss!! It’s been some journey
 The learning has been immense, some of which, i know, i will realize with time
 Thank you to each one who has been praying for me! Lots of love and prayers from my end to each one of you! My heart is bouncing with joy and gratitude🙏 # newyearhereicome # 2019❤️ # breastcancerwarriora post shared bytahirakashyapkhurrana(@tahirakashyap) onjan 5, 2019 at 1:14am pstview this post on instagraman opportunity to give competition to the Kardashians just went wasted! a week back i mentioned about ‘my badge of honour’ that i was going to receive
 And i did and am happy to share about it with the intention of it being received with love
 As that’s the only reason i am posting it
 Love for self and gratitude for the universe
 The picture might be disturbing for some, but these drains have become my dumbells for a few days
 i was detected with DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) in my right breast with high grade malignant cells
 Simply put stage 0 cancer / pre-cancerous stage, with cancer cells multiplying in a contained area
 The result i have become a half Indian version of Angelina Jolie (since only one breast was involved)! i told my doctor now is the time to give some competition to the Kardashians since Pamela is passé
 But no one listened to me, so now i have a portion of my back tissue in my breast
 Perhaps now i can do chin-ups with my breasts! Jokes apart, this obstacle has given me a new definition of life
 Respect it’s unpredictability and have the faith and courage to be the hero of your own drama of life
 The invincible human spirit is God like, gives you the courage to endure and the will to revive
 There is nothing that human spirit can’t do
 Also i want women of all ages to be aware
 i am 35, and i was returned twice over from a mammogram
 If any symptoms come up, think of it as a protective force and get yourselves examined
 Also we are so obsessed with boobs
 This mastectomy has left me with even more self love! Big, small, left or right inclined, gravity pulling or defying, or even none, each breast the presence or lack of it has a story to tell
 Mine has made me a 2
 0 version of myself! This post is dedicated to awareness, self love and resilience of a warrior that i know each one of us possesses❤️ # breastcancerawareness # selflove # determination # faith # bodhisattva # bodhisattvaoftheeartha post shared bytahirakashyapkhurrana (@tahirakashyap) onsep 22, 2018 at 1:59 am pdtview this post on instagramthat's what you do when cancer shows up
 You show it the way out! It is a tough phase to be in, but then i would have never known my own strength, which is inherent in each one of us, and which we come to know off when tested
 Like i said before, let's choose to be the heroes of our own drama of life
 i strongly believe if an obstacle comes in your life it is for you to deal with it, overcome it, beat the shit out of it and become a better version of yourself, which could be a bit worn out but would be experienced, a bit tattered but more wise, a bit left out but more to bring forth, a bit handicapped but better equipped! So now the upgraded version of myself is dealing with cancer stage 1 a, which is still a result of early detection
 I'll be going through 12 sessions of chemotherapy
 6 down, and another 6 left
 Hence the cap look nowadays😁 This post is dedicated to my journey where half the battle is won and the other half i want to fight with each of you who is enduring it
 Be resilient, be strong, we shall overcome and how! Also i have immense gratitude for people around me who have taken it in the right spirit and didn’t give up on me
 Personally i owe it to my best friend @ komal20to77 husband @ayushmannk parents @ kashyap6480 @yajankashyap
 This bit is taken for granted but when professionally you are supported and still look dependable your resilience to fight becomes stronger
 For this i owe it to @atulkasbekar @tanuj
 garg @findingshanti @shrutiv11 who too were shocked when they heard the news but didn’t give up and still lay bet on this bruised but not broken horse

 BJP and Aam Aadmi Party clashed with each other over the dengue cases in Delhi
 somvaar ko uttari emsidi kii baithak main jamkar hangaamaa hua
 Aam Aadmi Party's 25 councilors were suspended for 15 days following the uproar
 hangaamaa badhane par pehle to sadan thodi der ke liye sthagit kar diya gaya lekin baad main marshalls dwaara aam aadmi party ke parshadon ko sadan se baahar kar diya gaya
 During this, there was a lot of shocks
 aam aadmi party ke parshad or uttari dilli nagar nigam main netaa vipaksh surajeet pavaar ne kaha ki bijepi ne apni taanaashaahee dikhaate hue bounsars kii madad se party parshadon kii aawaaj ko dabaane kii koshish kii he lekin ham unhen chetanaa chaahate hai ki hamen chaahe jitna dabaa lo kejariwal sarkaar ke kaamon ko dabaa nahin paaoge
 Later, 25 councilors of Aam Aadmi Party were suspended from the House for 15 days
 congress ne is puure maamle main aam aadmi party or bijepi donon ko gheraa
 Mukesh Goyal, leader of the Congress Councilor Party on the matter, says that BJP and Aam Aadmi Party are competing to get credit while in the meantime, dengue is spreading rapidly in Delhi
 nagar nigam main kabiz bijepi ne is mudde par aam aadmi party ko anushaasan main rahane kii naseehat di or chetavanee dete hue kaha ki aage is tarah kaa vakya hoga to or bhi kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 North MCD Mayor Avtar Singh said that if the Aam Aadmi Party councilors repeat this kind of action, they will take more strict action against them
 barhaal dilli main dengue ke mudde ko lekar siyasat tej ho gai he
 Dengue cases have increased sharply this week
 dilli main is hafte dengue ke 46 nae maamle saamne aae hai
 So far, 217 cases of dengue have been registered in Delhi this year
 sarkaar ne guuruuvaar ko mahila aarakshan vidheyak ko manjuuri di, jisamen loksabhaa or rajyon kii vidhansabhaon main mahilaon ko 33 pratishat aarakshan diye jane kaa praavdhaan he
 The bill has been hanging for more than a decade due to lack of political consensus
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii adhyakshata main kendriya mantrimandal kii ek baithak main vidheyak ko manjuuri di gayi
 It has already been placed in the Rajya Sabha and has been referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Law and Order and Personnel Affairs
 sutron ne kaha ki vidheyak sadan kii sampatti he, isliye kaary mantranaa samiti is baat par faisla karegi ki aglaa kadam kab uthaaya jaae
 Some parties like Samajwadi Party and RJD are demanding reservation for women belonging to backward classes in reservation for women
 2014 ke baad saal dar saal rajyon main jeet hasil kar rahi bhartiya janata party ko rajasthan, chhattisgarh or madhya pradesh main karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 The new Congress governments in all the three states have already taken over, but the official website of the Bharatiya Janata Party is still running on the old pattern
 digital plateform or soshal media par hameshaa apadet rahane vaali bijepi kii website par ab bhi chhattisgarh, empi or rajasthan main bijepi kii hi sarkarein hai
 Not only this, in the list of bjp-ruled state governments on the website, clicking on the tabs of these three states, the website of former chief ministers is opening
 teenon rajya main ab bhi bijepi sarkaar!chunaav nateezon ko aae ek hafte se adhik ho chukaa he, lekin BJP kii aadhikarik website www
 bjp
 org par bana rajya sarkaron kaa teb teenon rajya main sarkaar ke link par purv mukhyamantri kii nijee website ko dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 For example, if a person clicks on the tab of Chhattisgarh then the official website of former Chief Minister Raman Singh (www
 drramansingh
 in) opens
 yahi haal madhya pradesh kaa he, agar empi ke teb par clic karen to shivaraj singh chouhan kii aadhikarik website (www
 shivrajsinghchouhan
 org) kaa link khulata he
 However, clicking on the Rajasthan tab opens the link of the Rajasthan government but the page is unable to open
 sabhi bijepi shasit rajya sarkaron kii listadrasal, bijepi ne apni website par rajya sarkaron kaa alag se teb banaaya hua he
 Where links to website of BJP ruled state governments are attached
 masalan, agar koi uttar pradesh ke teb par clic karata he to vah sidhaa uttar pradesh sarkaar kii aadhikarik website (up
 gov
 in) par pahunch jaataa he
 Or if you click on the tab of Arunachal then the official website of the Government of Arunachal Pradesh (www
 arunachalpradesh
 gov
 in) khulti he
 Why personal names on state governments? Actually, now this update of BJP is being questioned
 agar rajya se bhartiya janata party kii sarkarein chali gai hai to uske baavjood is prakaar list main naam dena or phir rajya sarkaron ke teb par kisi netaa kii personal website khulanaa kahaan tak jaij he
 Separate tabs have also been made for the state units
 On the website of the BBJP, separate tabs have been made available for the state units
 yani har rajya kii unit ke liye ek alag website khulti he
 For example, for Madhya Pradesh BJP (mp
 bjp
 org) or for Uttar Pradesh (up
 bjp
 org) opens
 gauratlab he ki chhattisgarh, rajasthan or madhya pradesh main hue vidhansabha chunaav main bhartiya janata party ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 In Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, the BJP had been in government for the last 15 years, while in Rajasthan the BJP government headed by Vasundhara Raje was running for the last five years
 aapako bataa den ki isse pehle bhi bhartiya janata party dwaara maange ja rahe donneton main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke naam kaa istemaal, sena or garib kii tasveeron ke istemaal par lagaataar sawaal uth rahe the
 In Maldives, it is nine o'clock in the morning
 karina or saf apane pehle shot ke liye taiyaar ho rahe hai
 The manager handling all the things is walking around them
 mechap kaa saamaan or kapadon ke rack idhar se udhar kiye ja rahe hai
 In the midst of all this hustle and bustle, i caught sight of a thing next to a wide-screen flat-screen TV in his private beach bungalow at Four Seasons Resort Malladivas on Kuda Hura Island
 yah jivs and wooster kaa dividi pack tha
 Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fray were in the lead roles in the nineties British TV series
 andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki donon ne raat main ise dekha hoga
 Thinking of what a perfect couple, i remember those forgettable characters of PG Woodhouse
 agle teen din main maine aisa kuch mahasoos kiya, jo mujhe saf or karina ke bare main sahaj hi soch lenaa chahie tha
 The first thing to know about both of them is that as they appear on screen, they are also in real life
 donon bhalaa ke khubasurat or haseen, ek dam feet
 As if glowing from within
 is intervyuu ke vakt donon kuch din maldive kii dhoop main tapakar tambai sunahare rang main jaise range hue the
 This had further enhanced their beauty
 karina ke kanery pile rang ke elisaab frock main unka tambai rang ubhar rahaa tha
 Mild coral lips and mascara-like eyes were making four moons
 karina itani gajab kii sundar lag raheen thim ki maine unke saath apni tasviir le lee
 There was definitely a slight blush, but where was such an opportunity again
 jab aap unase thodaa ghulte-milte hai to ek baat or samaj main aati he ki donon apni shakhsiyat ke bare main behad sahaj hai
 They understand what they mean to their audience
 ve jaanate hai ki un par logon kii najar hameshaa rahati he
 Both have lived like an open book in front of everyone since their dating days, so there is no pressure to look like a couple all the time
 karina kahati hai, ''kisi or abhinetri ne shaayad hi kabhi bolaa hoga ki shaadi se pehle vah kisi mard ke saath paanch saal se rah rahi he
 My parents were also a little worried
 ” apni bina shor-sharabe vaali shaadi ke kareeb saal bhar baad bhi donon ek-duusare se utana hi had darje vaala pyaar karte hai or donon ko hi ise dikhaane kii koi jarurat mahasoos nahin hoti
 Saif admitted that "this is a very quiet kind of company
" ”shoot ke dauraan unke bich aisa kuch bhi aade nahin aata
 However, the chemistry of each other is fully present
 donon ke bich sabase nikatataa kaa abhas tabhi hota he, jab karina shoot ke liye aawaaj detii hai ''sefu” or saf unhen beb kahkar bulaate hai
 i asked Kareena if she was compared to (angelina) Jolly- (brad) Pitts
 is par ve hansate hue kahati hai ki ''saf ko kisi se tulana karnaa pasand nahin
 They say that 'I don't like this Saifina tag too
 ye sab kya he? log aisa kyon kehete hai?’ unhen lagata he ki main ise badhaava detii hum or main kahati hum ki hameshaa mujh se aisa kyon kehete rahete hai? is par hamaare bich nokajhonk chalati rahati he
 Saif's outlook is always more serious
 saf kaa kariyar karina se bahut pehle 1992 main yash chopra kii parampara se shuru hua tha, jabaki karina ne varsh 2000 main jepi datta kii rifuji se filmi duniya main kadam rakhaa
 Saif was also married before and has two children with actress Amrita Singh
 par ye tathy ab unki jindagi main khalal nahin daalate
 Saif says, "earlier i always lived in a world of thoughts
 kuch na kuch kami dhundhata rahata tha or sawaal bahut karata tha
 Then i felt that either keep looking for the issue of quarrel or excuse to be happy
 ab karina ke saath to jindagi bas yun he ki do dil ek jaan kii manind rahete hai or ek-duusare ke sapane puure karne main lage rahete hai
 "I came back to India and met Kareena one day at the Mehboob Studio in Mumbai at a location
 maine sochaa tha ki industry ke ek behtareen kalakaar ke naate ve kisi bade star ke saath shoot kar rahi hongi, lekin karina to ek tivi kammertial kii shooting kar raheen thim
 They are so good that i had no problem waiting for their retake for a frame
 karina ke manager ne mujhase kaha ki das minute or
 i did not mind waiting
 ”is dauraan mujhe march, 2009 main bazaar india ke pehle ank kii yaad ai, jiske cover pej par karina kaa chitra tha
 Kareena had a photo with Saif on her inner pages
 donon kaa ek saath yah pehla photo tha, jo desh main ek fishan patrika ke liye khinchaa gaya tha
 Both were not married at that time
 yah lekh bhi unke jivan ke bare main pehla lekh he
 This is their first fashion magazine shoot as a married couple
 team ke liye bhi yah ek chakra puraa hone jaisaa ehsaas tha
 Kareena and Saif also said the same thing
 saf ke saath meri mulaakaat usee din ek duusari film ke set par hui thi
 Kareena says that "there was a time when we were in a different phase of our relationship, but we wanted to be together and we had no hesitation in being photographed together because we were completely devoted
" ham pyaar karte the or aaj bhi karte hai or duniya ko apana pyaar dikhaanaa chaahate the
 "she says," My favorite photo shot in this feature is the one in which Saif and i are running
 vah shot saf or mere bare main baat karata he ki ham ek jode kii tarah kaise lagate hai
 Very glamorous and very overwhelming
 ”glamer or power aise do shabd hai, jinhen bollywood ke saath akasar or bahut aasaani se jod liya jaataa he
 Nawab and Begum Pataudi are also not ignorant of these words as both have grown up in the shadows of well-known personalities
 lekin donon ko kareeb se dekhne par jaahir ho jaataa he ki mumbari ke bahut-se taqatvar jode sirf sapanili shaadi kaa dikhaava karte hai, lekin ye donon asal main use rojaanaa ji rahe hai
 In the middle of a few films together, this proximity will be clearly visible
 kuch log kahenge ki is najdiki se us film ko phayda hi hoga
 But Saif, realizing the truth, denies this and says that all this did not work at first
 (agent vinod kaa pitnaa unhen yaad aata he)
 Kareena also supports her husband, saying, "we respect each other very much as actors
" saf is baat se khush hai ki main auron ke saath kaam karti hum or main bhi khush hum ki ve baaki sabake saath kaam karte hai
 "the motive behind this shoot was that Kareena and Saif, the most brilliant couple of Bollywood's most luxurious couples, should be seen with Paparaji's lens
" khubasurat nain-naksh ke alaava donon adarsh aadhunik bhartiya jodi ke pratik hai
 Both stand at the stage in their careers, where there is no shortage of fame and money and can easily try new roles
 go goa gon ke produsar saf or satyagrah kii patrkaar karina isaki misaal hai
 This Kareena is far away from happiness and sometimes from the poo of gum
 karina ke shabdon main, ''logon ne mujhe salaah di ki main shaadi na karun kyonki shaadishuda actress utani hot nahin rahati or ham donon ne kaha ki hamane to aisi koi baat kabhi nahin suni
 i thought about this and i felt that i do not know at all, how this is going to affect me
 mujhe nahin lagata ki pyaar karnaa koi jurm he
 Like all the nights before and after Saif and Kareena returned home late that night and separately
 kisi or peshey main isse shaadi ke rishte par kuch dabaav pad saktaa tha, lekin yahaan aisa nahin tha
 Working in the same profession increases understanding between them and both take care of each other's schedule more
 saf ke shabdon main ''ham majaak karte hai ki ye kisi police vaale yaa doctor se shaadi karne jaisaa he kyonki ham hameshaa on kol rahete hai or koi bhi plan bananaa mushkil hota he
 Nevertheless, we steal the opportunity from here and there and they also play it very well
 iske liye main apni kismat kaa shukraguzaar hum
 "kareena also quips," See, by the time they come back home to me, we can have fun and romance in the same way with all the beautiful people in the industry

 com / 3jykcbwd1r — Dave Burke (@davey_burke) August 17, 2015 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress ke sabase badi party banakar ubharne par pradhanmantri banane ke rahul gandhi ke bayaan par hindustani avam morcha ke netaa jeethanram maanjhi ne pratikriya dete hue sawaal uthaae hai
 Manjhi has said how Rahul Gandhi can say this without consensus in the grand alliance
 maanjhi ne kaha ki parampara rahi he ki sabase bade dal ke netaa pradhanmantri bane, lekin gaiyr bijepi gathbandhan main mayawati, mulaayam or mamata bhi pradhanmantri ummidavaar hai
 Therefore it is necessary to build consensus
 darasal mangalvaar korahul gandhi karnataka ke chikballapur main kaha ki agar 2019 main congress sabase badi party banati he to pradhanmantri ban sakate hai
 Rahul Gandhi said that in 2019 BJP will not form government nor will Narendra Modi become Prime Minister
 karnataka main logon se baat karte hue congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne bayaan diya he ki aap log abhi mere bayaan par hasenge lekin 2019 main bijepi sarkaar nahin banaaegi
 He said that today the opposition is one, that is why it will be difficult for BJP in 2019
 2019 main main banuunga piem!jab rahul gandhi se pradhanmantri pad ke liye sawaal poocha gaya, ki kya ve pradhanmantri banenge
 So he said if the Congress party comes to power then why not
 unhone kaha ki agar 2019 main congress sabase badi party banati he to vah piem ban sakate hai
 RJD chief Lalu Prasad claimed to have a two-thirds majority of the RJD-LJP alliance in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections, saying that he would not fall in the state's chief minister Nitish Kumar in the election
 basapa ke purv koshadhyaksh shyaam laal kushvaha, jadyu ke ramakrishna bharti or rajeshwar chaoupal ke rajd kii sadsyta grahan karne par party main unka swaagat karte hue lalu ne aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main rajd-lojpa gathbandhan ke do tihaai bahumat paane kaa daawa karte hue kaha ki chunaav main ve nahin pradesh ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar aundhe munh girenge
 Lalu said that jdu's Veena joined the royal RJD and in the coming days a large number of people from different parties are going to join the RJD

 The data leaks of State Bank of India, India's largest bank, have come to light
 america tech website tech crunch kii ek report ke mutabik bank kaa sarwar bina password ke tha
 Because of this, information of millions of customers can be accessed
 yah bank kaa sarwar mumbai besd data centre main he
 This data center holds 2 months of data from SBI Quick
 SBI Quick ek system he jiske tahat acount holders ko text massej or kol par acount se judi basic jaankaree di jaati he
 It is easy to access due to not being secure
 reports ke mutabik yah saaf nahin he ki ye sarwar kab se open or an protected he
 a security researcher found the server open and Tech Crunch is the first to report it
 haalanki jis security research ne state bank of india kii ye khami ujagar kii he unhone naam na bataane kii shart rakhi he
 Through SBI Quick, customers of the bank get information about accounts by making missed calls and textmaking
 BAL kiward send karnaa hota he isse bank us customers ke registerd mobile number ko pahchaan kar us number par jaankaree bhejtaa he
 Details of account balance and last five transactions are available
 iske alaava is sarvice k tahat atm card block bhi karaae ja sakate hai
 Tech Crunch has confirmed that the back end text messages have been leaked which have millions of message stores every day
 chunki database manr koi password nahin set kiya gaya tha isliye kasmtors ke saare text massej dekhe gaye hai jo real time hai
 These include customers' phone numbers, bank balances and recent transactions
 is database main customers ke partial acount numbers bhi hai
 According to the report, this database access was also found that the bank has sent about 3 million text messages only on Monday
 is database main lakhon text massej kaa daily arkive he jo disambar tak kaa he yani koi bhi inamen se customers kii phinantial jaanakri dekh saktaa he
 a database without a password can be quite dangerous for sensitive information of customers
 kyonki isamen acces karke customers kii jaankariyaan koi haikar galat kaam yaa frod karne ke liye ikaitha kar saktaa he
 With this database, the work of advertising companies can also be made easier
 kyonki yahaan customers ke phone numbers bhi die hue hai
 The State Bank of India has not yet released any statement on this report
 haalanki state bank of india raaton raat database sicyor kar diya he
 What happens without a database without a password? It is quite simple - there are many ways in which data are stored in computers
 yahaan organijd tareeke se jaankariyan store kii gayi hoti hai
 This data is made easier so that the company can use it
 yah kai baar real time apadet or manage kiye jate hai
 Companies protect database servers in many ways, including hardware and software security
 lekin basic security password hota he jo kii kaaphi aam he
 But as mentioned in this report, there was no password in the database, this is a very serious matter
 ise aap chook kahen yaa laaparvaahee
 But this can cause a big loss to customers

 Let me tell you that Tej Bahadur Yadav had earlier submitted his claim as an independent candidate against Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM Modi), in which he had said in his affidavit to be sacked from the army, but on behalf of Samajwadi Party Probably concealed this fact when he filed his nomination
 namakan patr jaanch ke dauraan varanasi ke riterning afasar ko jab is tathy kii jaankaree mili to unhone notice bhejkar unase iskaa jawaab maanga he
 Tej Bahadur, a BSF sacked soldier, has been issued a notice today through the Returning Officer in Benaras because of filling various facts in his nomination, in response to which Tej Pratap is saying something like this pic
 twitter
 com / 7thiavr1qm Tej Bahadur will have to give this answer by 11:00 am on May 1 to the District Collectorate
 iske baad unke namakan kii vaidya or avaidh hone kii prakriya hogi
 In this regard, Tej Bahadur is saying that this trick is being done to reject our nomination by coming under pressure from the government
 unhone kaha ki isse saaf jaahir he ki hamaare desh ke andar hitalarshahi he
 He said that he has put his full strength to stop me
 tej bahadur ne kaha ki ye sab modi ke ishaaron par kiya ja rahaa he

 There are four or five women in the other corner of the same room who after finishing their household work, gather here for the promotion of Tej Bahadur and then go to different mohallos for campaigning
 isse pehlesamachar agency ANI se baatcheet main tej bahadur yadav ne kaha tha, 'hamaare mudde jawan, kisaan or naujavaanon ke liye naukariyaan hai
 People should identify who is the real watchman of the country
 mujhe jeet kaa bharosa he
 ' bihar main lagata he mantri or adhikari ek duusare se baat chit nahin karte
 An example of this was seen on Saturday when Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi said that after misusing his position on the furnishings of the bungalow at 5 Desharatna Marg, after the news of Tejashwi Yadav being given a clean chit by the Principal Secretary, Building Construction Department
 The government has not given a clean chit to Tejashwi Yadav in terms of spending
 modi ne kaha ki aakhir kis niyam ke tahat tejasvi yadav ne bhawan nirmaan vibhaag ke atirikt pul nirmaan nigam se 59 lakh kaa keemtee furniture mangavaya
 He said that under which provision Tejashwi Yadav provided AC not only in the room but also in the toilet, 35 expensive leather sofas, exotic granite / marble, wooden paneling of walls and wooden flooring on the floor, modular kitchen, 464 expensive fancy LED Spending a lot of money on the lights, 108 fans, billiards tables of millions, and precious curtains etc
 modi ke anusaar tejasvi yadav kii apavyayita, phijulkharchi va bangale kii 7 star vaali saaj-sajja ke baad hi to bhawan nirmaan vibhaag ko nayaa guideline jari karnaa padaa he taaki bhavishya main koi vyakti tejasvi kii tarah sarkari dhan kaa durupyog nahin kar sake
 If Tejashwi Yadav had not misused his position and occupied the bungalow with impunity, the Supreme Court would not have to force him to vacate the bungalow by imposing a penalty of Rs 50,000

 a bench of Justice b Sudarshan Reddy and Justice SS Nijjar said that the manner in which the judge of the lower court rejected the claim of the directorate and gave a very detailed order along with granting bail to Khan is quite disturbing
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne shuru main khan:53: ko nideshaalay kii 72 ghante kii remand main diya tha lekin mahanyaywaadee gopal subramanyam kii ore se kiye gaye anurodh ke baad usne ise badhaakar chaar din kar diya
 The bench said, "we are deeply disturbed by the manner in which the action was taken
" sunwaayee adaalat ke khan ko jamaanat dene ke faisle par roak lagaate hue nyaayalay ne poocha, vidwaan nyaayadhish ne itnaa kuch kyon likhaa? sheersh adaalat ne kaha ki maamle kii asaadhaaran paristhitiyon ko dekhte hue sunwaayee adaalat ke faisle par vah roak laga rahi he
 "the judgment given by the learned judge has created an extraordinary situation which could have a negative impact on the investigation," the bench said
 asaadhaaran sthiti, maamle kii jatilta or iskaa satar dekhte hue ham faisle par roak lagane ko upyukt maanate hai
 Earlier, having a strong view on behalf of the ED, the Solicitor General argued that the trial court judge went beyond plea and granted bail to Khan despite neither the accused nor his lawyer requesting it
 unhone rekhaankit kiya ki idi ne hiraasat main poochtacha ke liye remand ke liye aavedan diya tha jabaki nyaayadhish ne khan ko jamaanat de di
 The Solicitor General claimed that the ED has strong evidence against Khan, which shows that he has amassed a lot of black money in many foreign banks
 solisitor general ne aarope lagaaya ki khan ne ek swiss bank se 60,000 dollar nikaala or is aarope ke pramaan main swiss aadhikarik sutron kaa hawala diya

 khan ke khilaaf idi kii jaanch ke alaava iskar vibhaag se 70,000 karod ke kar ko lekar notice bhi mili he
 The Enforcement Directorate arrested Khan on March 7 after the Supreme Court pulled up the ED for not being able to interrogate Khan's custody but was released by the trial court

 The second most terrible earthquake of the century in Nepal had just passed for 16 days when the sudden floods from Nepal to India and all the surrounding areas slashed the land once again under the feet of the people
 himalay kii god main based chote se mulk nepal par kudarti kahar apni har aahat ke saath hansate-khelte insaanon kii zindagi chin rahaa he
 This is the second time in the last 17 days, when this waterfall in Nepal has killed thousands of people and killed thousands of lives
 aisa tab he, jab logon kii jehan main 25 april ke usajalajle kii yaad abhi taaja he, jisane ek hi jatke main 8 hajaar se zyada logon ko leel liya tha
 Suddenly there was a stir under the earth at 12

 himalay ke aas-paas ke ek bade ilaake main bukamp ke jatke mahasoos kiye jane lage
 Then wherever he found a place, he started trying to avoid the same tremor
 jald hi seismograph ne is bukamp kii report bhi de di
 These blow 7 on the Richter scale
 3 kaa tha
 That is, a strong earthquake
 or ittefaq se is baar bhi bukamp kaa ye centre bharat se sate nepal main tha
 The epicenter of the earthquake was 19 kilometers below the earth in Kodari, Nepal
 agle sava ghante main ek ke baad ek chah chote-bade bukamp ke jhatkon ne logon ko hilaa kar rakh diya
 Second shock: 12 noon

 jabaki kodari, chautaara or sindhupal ilaake main kai imaarat jameendoj ho gaye
 The most frightening picture of the earthquake was seen in the National Assembly of Nepal, when cameras in the National Assembly during the Kodari earthquake captured the picture of the earthquake live
 nepal ke essembly main tab sambodhan jari tha, lekin achaanak bukamp ne sabakuch buree tarah hilne laga
 There was a stampede in the entire assembly and lightning went away on seeing it
 maukey kii najaakat ko dekhte hue takreeban ghante bhar ke liye nepal ke kathmandu airport ko band kar diya gaya
 The devastation was not just in Nepal, but in Nepal as well as in states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, India, the earthquake left its devastation

 Areas like Kodari, Sindhupal Gorkha and Dolkha of Nepal were the worst affected in this earthquake
 sutron kii maane to dolkha ilaake main takreeban 90 fisadi yani kareeb 400 makaan is bukamp kii vajah se dharashayi ho gaye
 After all, why does the earth tremble intermittently? There can be many answers to this question

 Scientists believe that the two important plates under the earth often collide between the Indian and Eurasian plates under the Himalayas
 darasal, dharti chaar paraton se bani he
 Inner core, outer core, mantle and crust

 This time, the activation of these plates under the Himalayas has caused havoc, its center is just 19 km below

 - The longest fault line among these is Delhi Sargodaha, which runs to Pakistan, - The second fault line is delhi-dehradun which connects it to Himalayas, - The third fault line is rohtak-faridabad and-4th delhi-agrafault line
 inhen folt lines kii vajah se dilli ensiaar ko sismik jone 4 main rakhaa jaataa he
 At present, delhi-sargoda fault line is believed to be the reason for the danger of major earthquake
 is line main sakriyata isaki vajah se sonipat pichley kuch barason main kam takat vaale bukamp ke kai kendra bane
 But there has been no major earthquake in the last 295 years on this fault line leading to Pakistan
 lekin khatra sirf local folt line hi nahin he
 According to experts, the tectonic plate of the entire Indian subcontinent has been locked for some time
 agar ye plate khiske to haalat bhayanak hogi

 He told that Akbar was very particular about how people came to know him

 As expected, the first day of the monsoon session of Parliament was uprooted

 sushamaa swaraj ne bhi kaha ki wo lalitget main jawaab dene ko taiyaar he, lekin sarkaar kii koshishon ke baavjood sadan kii kaarywahi nahin chal pai
 In fact, just before the start of the monsoon session, the Prime Minister had hoped that the government would be supported by the opposition parties this time
 sansad pahunchate hi pradhanmantri ne kaha tha, "desh ko aage badhaane ke liye mahatvapurn nirnay sab milakar karen, ye prayaas hamaara nirantar rahaa he, aage bhi rahegaa
 In the last session, some political parties had assured that in the next session some work would be completed on priority

 congress, left or samaajawaadee party ne rajyasabha main puure din hangaamaa kiya or sushamaa swaraj, vasundhara raaje sindhiya or shivaraj singh chouhan kaa istifa maangate rahe
 Although Congress leader Anand Sharma in Rajya Sabha had proposed to stop work, but after seeing the support of other parties, he started demanding his resignation
 rajyasabha baar-baar sthagit hoti rahi or akhirkaar teen baje kaarywahi agle din ke liye taal di gai
 The comments rajyasabha main hangaame ke bich sansadeey kaary rajyamantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne saaf kar diya ki kisi bhi bijepi mantri ke istife kaa koi sawaal hi nahin he
 It is clear that the beginning is telling that these clouds of confrontation will be cloudy over the entire monsoon session
 2010 main bijepi ne sansad main maang kii thi ki tuji ghotaale par sadan main tabhi charchaa ho sakati he jab is ghotaale ke aaropee mantri istipha de den
 Now after five years, the leaders of Congress, Left and Samajwadi Party are demanding the same in front of the NDA government, but the problem is that today the trend of NDA government is the same as that of UPA government five years ago

 The days of Nakara officers in Madhya Pradesh are going to be over

 lekhakon kii mandi main bazaarwaad haviah bhalchandra joshiurmilah aaj bazaar dhire-dhire sab kuch badal detaa habazar bataata he ki aaj hamaare adarsh kunh madhujarurat badal gai pataa nahin chaltah bhalchandra joshisahitya ke sabase bade mahakumbh sahitya ajtak 2019 ke duusare din 'kitna jaruri he bazaar' vishay par yojit paricharchaa par manch par upasthit hindi lekhakon ne sweekaar kiya ki aaj ke daur main bazaarwaad haaavee ho gaya he bazaar hi sab kuch tay kar rahaa he
 Change in something is not very easy in marketism, but it is to be expected that in the changing times, there will be a phase of change
 sahitya ajtak 2019 ke manch se mashhoor lekhak bhalchandra joshi ne kaha ki aajkal kaa lekhak mandi main khadaa he, or vahaan vichaar kii koi kadra nahin he
 Marketism dominates in the market and in such a situation the writer is compelled to write according to the market
 bazaar jaruratein tay karne lagaah bhalchandra joshibhalachandra joshi ne aage kaha ki bazaar ne aaj ke daur main aisi aadhuniktaa kaa bodh viksit kiya he ki pehle kii sabhi chijen puraani si pratit hone lagi he
 It is not that there was no modernity in the earlier market, but today marketism has come to dominate and today when man is becoming a consumer, the market is adapting it to suit him
 bazaarwaad main uski jaruraton ke bare main bataaya jaataa he
 On the question of Hindi writer Bhalchandra Joshiaj who is a monk and wants to take possession of everything, writer Madhu Kankaria said to what extent the market slaughts humanity
 inako kuch udaahranon se samajha ja saktaa he
 In Switzerland, there has been official recognition for Anthiasia and any order could have sought death by taking orders from the court
 lekin vahaan bhi anthesia ke liye kai companiyaan lagi hui hai or companiyon ke apane-apane katalog he or vahaan isse jude kai package bhi chalate hai or iske aadhaar par maut di jaati he
 You are given death based on the package you choose
 isi tarah america main 9 / 11 hamale ke baad banduukon kii bikri bad gai, vahaan kii maataaon ne bandook ke bazaar par ankush lagane kii maang kii, lekin us par roak nahin lagaai gai or iske bandish se dar kaa maahaul banaaya gaya
 Talking about the temple at Tirupati in India, there are many groups active to see God, who ask you to give money and see God easily
 ab badlaav kaa pataa nahin chaltah urmilabazarwaad ke daur main lekhak ke rup main kariyar shuru karne ke maamle par urmila shiris ne kaha ki aaj ke daur main yah kahana mushkil he ki kariyar kis mode par jayega
 When the writer of Hindi writes, he is worried that he will be able to run his life with it
 hindi lekhika urmilahindi kii tulana main bangala, marathi or tamil bhashi lekhakon kii sthiti behatar hone ke sawaal par lekhak bhalchandra joshi ne kaha ki bangala, marathi or tamil jaisi bhashaaon main vibhaajan nahin he, lekin hindi main aisa nahin he
 There are many classes here
 media main lekhan ko bhi lekhak kaha gaya he
 While this is not the case in other places
 unhone aage kaha ki khaas baat yah he ki bazaar dhire-dhire chizon ko is tarah se badalata he ki hamen pataa nahin chalata he
 When we started running according to the market, it could not even be guessed
 bazaar ne hamaare adarsh badal dieh madhuhamaara lekhak samaaj ke bich nahin jaataa, hatya ho jaati he, dalit hinsa hoti he, mob linching ho jaati he, lekin lekhak vahaan nahin jaataa
 On the question of the Hindi writer not being able to make a mark among the people and staying away from writing on serious issues, writer Madhu Kankaria said that it is not that the writer does not go there
 in gambhir vishyon par hindi ke lekhakon ne lekhnee chalaai he
 Many compositions were composed in Hindi on the subjects of farmers, Dalits, women, etc
, but the market changes our thinking
 jab coca cola jab kahata he ki thanda matlab coca cola, lekin ham bhul jate hai ki ghade se bhi thanda pani miltaa he
 Hindi writer Madhu Kankariamdhu further said that in today's era, the market changes our ideals
 dugdh kranti ke jariye hajaaron logon ko rojgaar dene vaale vargeez courian, paryaavaran bachaane kii muhim chhedane vaale sundar laal bahuguna jaise log ab adarsh nahin rahe
 Today, the market tells us our model
 bazaar ne jise bada batalaaya use bacchon ne bada bataaya, yahi badi chunauti he
 Most writers became comfortable: Urmila Shirish said that on the subject of not being able to speak to the youth and people on many sensitive topics during the era of Urmila, why is the writer not going among the common people
 hamaare zyaadaatar lekhak suvidhajanak ho gaya he
 Today's writers are engaged in making the monks happy
 unka apana hit sadha hua he
 Sleeping student is visible among the students, today the student does not look awake
 lekhakon kaa kartavya banataa he ki samaaj ke har tabake ko jaagrath kiya jaae
 On the dominance of marketism, writer Bhalchandra Joshi said that when it comes to the market, it comes with complete preparation and when it invests thousands of crores, it does so with complete planning
 bazaar har cheez ko apane hisaab se tay karata he
 In Bengal, a set of 25 books of an author can be found for 200 rupees, whereas this is not the case with Hindi language writers
 bazaar hi sab kuch tay karata he
 Whites cream is sold in a country full of black people
 isliye bazaarwaad main kisi cheez kaa badlaav bahut aasaan nahin he

 The 3-day event will run from 1 November to 3 November at the Indira Gandhi National Center for the Arts in Delhi
 'sahitya ajtak 2019' ke bade swaroop or bhavyata kaa andaaj isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki is saal aamantrit atithiyon kii sankhya 300 ke paar he jinamein kala, sahitya, sangeet, samskruti or kitabon se judi antarrashtriya khyaati praapt shakhsiyaten jute rahi hai
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has currently refused to sit on a hunger strike since March 31
 iske baad vyapaaree sanghathan cat ne ise vyapaariyon ke saath dhokhaa bataate hue siem kejariwal se istife kii maang kii he
 After the postponement of the hunger strike by the Confederation of All India Traders, CAT general secretary Praveen Khandelwal said that the postponement of the indefinite fast by CM Arvind Kejriwal starting March 31 against sealing indefinitely is a big betrayal to the traders of Delhi
 unhone kaha ki kejariwal kaa yah you-turn cat ke us bayaan kii pushti karata he jisamen kaha gaya tha ki ye siem kejariwal kaa raajnneetik stant he, jiskaa makasad sirf or sirf vyapaariyon kii sahanubhuti lenaa he
 Postponing the hunger strike clearly shows that CM Kejriwal has nothing to do with the traders
 khandelwal ne kaha ki vyapaariyon or unke yahaan kaam karne vaale karmchaariyon kii roji-roti se jude is behad gambhir or samvedansheel mudde ke saath siem kejariwal ne raajnneeti kii he or vyapaariyon kii bhaawanaaon ke saath khilwaad kiya he, jisase dilli ke vyapaaree behad aahat hai
 Khandelwal has demanded the resignation of CM Arvind Kejriwal
 khandelwal ne bataaya ki siem kejariwal ke anshan ko lekar dilli ke vyapaariyon main shuru se hi bhram bana hua tha, jo anshan sthagit hote hi sach main badal gaya
 Khandelwal said that he had already feared that the announcement of Kejriwal's fast was a conspiracy to earn cheap popularity
 bataa den ki kuch din pehle amar colony main jakarsiem kejarivalane 31 march tak ceiling naa rukne par khud bhukh hadtaal par baithne ko kaha tha
 The Confederation of All India Traders said that while Kejriwal's fasting would not only strengthen the ceilings issue, on the other hand, the central government would also be pressured to find a solution to the sealing soon

 khudara epadiai ko lekar sansad main gatirodh gahraane ke bich pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne guuruuvaar ko apane sahyogi dalon se kaha ki is faisle ko waapas lenaa mushkil hoga or yadi is mudde par koi mat vibhaajan ho to sahyogiyon ko sarkaar ke paksh main matdaan karnaa chahie
 The entire opposition is united on the demand for a postponement of the work on this issue
 singh or samprag ke sankatmochak maane jane vaale pranav mukherjee ne sambhavat: sahyogi dalon se kaha he ki aarthik halaat kaaphi mushkil hai or jidipi vikaas dar ko lekar kai chintaaen hai
 According to Trinamool Congress leader Sudeep Bandopadhyay, Singh and Mukherjee told the leaders of allies that the cabinet had taken this decision in a difficult situation and it would be difficult to withdraw from it
 faisle ko waapas lene par adi trinmul ke sansadeey dal ke netaa bandopadhyaay ne haalanki kaha ki unki party nahin chaahati he ki sarkaar gire
 The first eight days of the winter session were uprooted
 haalanki sarkaar or congress ne ummid jataayi he ki sattadhari gathbandhan ke paas sankhya bal kii kami nahin he or usne avishvaas prastaav ko lekar vipaksh ko chunauti bhi di he
 a source among the Congress's allies, however, said that Mukherjee, who is also the leader of the Lok Sabha, has told him that the blasphemy motion is not a no-confidence motion but if it is passed, it would hurt the credibility of the government
 trinmul, dramuk, rakanpa, neshnal conference or iuemail ke netaaon ne pradhanmantri dwaara is masale par charchaa ke liye bulaayi gayi baithak main shirkat kii
 The Trinamool and the DMK have continued to oppose the policy of retail FDI and have asked the government to withdraw the decision taken in this regard
 ve is mudde par sansad main charchaa bhi chaahate hai
 However, the DMK seems to be softening its stand
 party netaa tii aar baaluu ne sambhavat: pradhanmantri se kaha he ki yadi mat vibhaajan hua to vah party pramukh em karunanidhi se is bare main salaah mashvira kar party ke ruukh se sarkaar ko avgat karaayenge
 Interestingly, Karunanidhi, who first gave a tough statement on this issue, told reporters yesterday that when this issue comes up, the party will decide how to vote on the work adjournment motion
 bandopadhyaay ne kaha ki sahyogi dal bady partiyon ko suzav dete hai kyonki yah keval congress kii nahin balki gathbandhan kii sarkaar he
 Meanwhile, a formula is also being talked about, according to which the allies will support the government in Parliament but will clarify that they will not implement this policy in their ruled states
 aisi khabaren bhi hai ki yadi mat vibhaajan hua to trinmul ke saansad shaayad sadan se anupasthit rahen lekin dramuk or trinmul netaaon ne is bare main puche gayi sawaalon ko taal diya
 Meanwhile, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal expressed confidence that the government had a majority
 mujhe yakeen he ki sarkaar ke paas bahumat he
 You will see if you get a chance
 unhone haalanki is mudde par kisi bhi sawaal kaa jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya
 Congress spokesperson Rashid Alvi challenged the opposition to show a no-confidence motion if it feels that the government does not have the required majority

 purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ke rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke kaarykram main shaamil hone par abhi bhi raajnneetik pratikriyaayein aa rahi hai
 Congress leader Manish Tiwari has tweeted and asked Pranab Mukherjee directly the question as to why he chose to go to the RSS headquarters
 tiwari ne kaha ki jab aresas ko bain kiya gaya tha, tab aap 1975 or 1992 ke samay sarkaar kaa hissaa the
 You still haven't answered why you went there hurting the sentiments of millions of secularists
 congress netaa ne likhaa ki aapako bataanaa chahie ki hamen sikhaaya gaya tha ki aresas galat he, lekin ab aisa kya ho gaya he ki vah sahi ho gaya he
 He wrote whether this would be seen as an attempt by the RSS to enter the mainstream
 ise bhi padhein
 
 
 In Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's class, Pranab taught gandhi-nehru's nationalism Manish Tiwari fired questions directly to Pranab da, making four consecutive tweets
 bataa den ki pranab mukherjee ke bhaashan se pehle congress netaa kai baar unka virodh karte nazar aae
 But after his speech he said that Pranab Mukherjee has learned the RSS only through his speech
 4 / 4 was it will be seen as just an attempt to mainstream RSS in secular&pluralistic consciousness
 History tells us when Nazi's were strutting around Europe in black berets Chamberlain thru Munich Pact - 1938 thought he had bought the 'peace of our Times'
 What a false dawn it was😢— Manish Tewari (@manishtewari)june 8, 2018kya bole the anya congressi netaa?aresas ke kaarykram main pranab mukherjee ke jane se congress asahaj he
 This is also evident from the statements of party leaders
 congress netaa anand sharma ne kaha ki aresas ke mukhyalay main congress ke netaa rahe pranab da ko dekhakar congress ke lakhon kaaryakartaaon or bharat kii bahulata, vividhta or bhartiya ganraajya ke aadharbhoot mulyon main vishwaas karne vaale logon ko bahut dukh hua he

 There does not seem to be anything that the RSS is going to remove from its agenda

 And Pranab Mukherjee's visit to Nagpur will help the Sangh to increase its acceptance in society and in various states

 Accusing the Indian Premier League of making cricketers greedy, Sri Lanka's World Cup winning captain Arjun Ranatunga today said that Indian cricket has got nothing but infamy from this league and he is surprised that many great cricketers are trying to save it
 
 rantunga ne kaha, main pehle se kahata aayaa hum ki ipel cricket main sattebaaji, phixing, sharabkhori, doping jaisi kai buraaiyon ko lekar aayaa he
 The current spot-fixing episode has served to strike the last nail in the coffin and i believe the IPL should be discontinued for the betterment of cricket
 ipel ke mukhar aalochakon main se ek rahe rantunga ne hairaani jataai ki kai mahaan cricketer ipel ke paksh main bol rahe hai
 He said, i am sad that many great cricketers of his day are defending IPL to make money
 irapalli prasanna jaise kuch hi cricketer hai, jo iske khilaaf khulkar saamne aae hai
 He said, why is the IPL being played
 isse bhartiya cricket ko kya mila he
 India has never been so infamous in world cricket
 yah 2000 ke match phixing prakaran ke baraabar kaa maamla he or iskaa asar sirf bharat tak simit nahin he
 Ranatunga said, "I have not seen a single player in the last six years who owes IPL to Indian cricket
" ipel ke chalate bharat ko kabhi tendulkar, dravid, gavaskar yaa kapil jaise khilaadi nahin mil sakenge
 He also said that the bcci's structure of domestic cricket is so capable that it can produce good cricketers and there is no need of IPL
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki sirf ipel chah hi nahin balki har satr main bhrashtachar kaa shaq rahaa he or isisi kii bhrashtachar nirodhak ikai ke purv adhyaksh sar paal condon ne 2008 main ipel ke pehle satr ke baad hi iske sanket die the
 Ranatunga said the fixing in the IPL has now been revealed, but since the first season in 2008, the needle of suspicion was on the league
 sar paal condon ne is par ek dastavej bhi isisi board ko diya tha
 He said, Sir Pal Kandon had said that after nineties, now IPL has emerged as an easy means of corruption in cricket
 yadi bisisiai ko vaaki cricket se bhrashtachar ko dur karnaa tha to usee samay karrwai kerani chahie thi
 He said, but the Indian board formed its own anti-corruption unit and some controversy was involved in every IPL
 yah cricket nahin balki cricket kaa tamaasha he or khilaadiyon ko laalchee bana rahaa he
 The comments kuch bhartiya satorion ke srilanka premier lig main kuch frenchiji ke benami maalik hone kii khabaron ke bare main poochne par rantunga ne kaha ki isaki jaanch honi chahie
 He said, i have also read such news
 main shuru se srilanka premier lig ke bhi khilaaf tha, kyonki mujhe andeshaa tha ki aisi kisi bhi lig ke saath gaiyr jaruri chijen bhi cricket main aa jaaengi
 If this is the case, it should be investigated
 rantunga ne yah bhi kaha ki ipel main aniyamittaaon kii swatantra jaanch honi chahie or sarkaar ko isamen dakhal dena chahie
 He said, Government of India should take BCCI under its umbrella as it is in Sri Lanka
 bisisiai ke maujuuda padaadhikariyon ko barkhaast karke nae sire se chayan hona chahie
 Ranatunga said, i have been saying beforehand that IPL has brought many evils like betting, fixing, alcoholism, doping in cricket
 maujuuda spot phixing prakaran ne taabut main aakhri keel thokane kaa kaam kiya he or meraa maananaa he ki cricket kii bhalaai ke liye ipel ko band kar dena chahie
 Ranatunga, one of the outspoken critics of the IPL, expressed surprise that many great cricketers are speaking in favor of the IPL
 unhone kaha, mujhe dukh he ki apane jamaane ke kai mahaan cricketer paisa kamaane ke liye ipel kaa bachaav kar rahe hai
 There are only a few cricketers like Irapalli Prasanna, who have come out openly against it
 unhone kaha, ipel kyon khelaa ja rahaa he
 What has Indian cricket got from this? vishwa cricket main bharat kii itani badanaami kabhi nahin hui
 It is a case equivalent to the 2000 match-fixing episode and its impact is not limited to India alone
 rantunga ne kaha, mujhe pichley chah saal main ek bhi khilaadi aisa nahin dekha jo bhartiya cricket ko ipel kii dein ho
 Due to the IPL, India will never get players like Tendulkar, Dravid, Gavaskar or Kapil
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki bisisiai kaa gharelu cricket kaa dhaancha itnaa sakasham he ki usase achche cricketer nikal sake or use ipel kii koi jarurat nahin he
 He also said that corruption has been suspected not just in IPL 6 but in every session and that Sir Pal Kandon, the former chairman of the ICC anti-corruption Unit, hinted at it only after the first session of IPL in 2008
 rantunga ne kaha, ipel main phixing kaa khulaasa ab hua he, lekin 2008 main pehle satr se hi shaq kii sui is lig par thi
 Sir Pal Kandon also gave a document on this to the ICC Board
 unhone kaha, sar paal condon ne kaha tha ki nabbe ke dashak ke baad ab ipel cricket main bhrashtachar ke aasaan jariye ke rup main ubhara he
 If BCCI really had to remove corruption from cricket, then action should have been taken at that time
 unhone kaha, lekin bhartiya board ne apni khud kii bhrashtachar nirodhak ikai banaai or har ipel main koi naa koi vivaad judaa rahaa
 It is not cricket but the spectacle of cricket and making players greedy
 tippaniyan Asked about reports of some Indian bookies being the benami owners of some franchises in the Sri Lanka Premier League, Ranatunga said it should be investigated
 unhone kaha, maine bhi aisi khabaren padhi hai
 i was also against the Sri Lanka Premier League from the beginning, because i was afraid that with any such league, non-essential things would also come into cricket
 agar aisa he to isaki jaanch honi chahie
 Ranatunga also said that there should be an independent inquiry into irregularities in the IPL and the government should interfere in it
 unhone kaha, bharat sarkaar ko chahie ki bisisiai ko apni chhatrachhaaya main le jaisaa ki srilanka main he
 The current BCCI office bearers should be sacked and re-elected
 unhone kaha, mujhe dukh he ki apane jamaane ke kai mahaan cricketer paisa kamaane ke liye ipel kaa bachaav kar rahe hai
 There are only a few cricketers like Irapalli Prasanna, who have come out openly against it
 unhone kaha, ipel kyon khelaa ja rahaa he

 unhone kaha, sar paal condon ne kaha tha ki nabbe ke dashak ke baad ab ipel cricket main bhrashtachar ke aasaan jariye ke rup main ubhara he
 If BCCI really had to remove corruption from cricket, then action should have been taken at that time
 unhone kaha, lekin bhartiya board ne apni khud kii bhrashtachar nirodhak ikai banaai or har ipel main koi naa koi vivaad judaa rahaa
 It is not cricket but the spectacle of cricket and making players greedy
 tippaniyan Asked about reports of some Indian bookies being the benami owners of some franchises in the Sri Lanka Premier League, Ranatunga said it should be investigated
 unhone kaha, maine bhi aisi khabaren padhi hai
 i was also against the Sri Lanka Premier League from the beginning, because i was afraid that with any such league, non-essential things would also come into cricket
 agar aisa he to isaki jaanch honi chahie
 Ranatunga also said that there should be an independent inquiry into irregularities in the IPL and the government should interfere in it
 unhone kaha, bharat sarkaar ko chahie ki bisisiai ko apni chhatrachhaaya main le jaisaa ki srilanka main he
 The current BCCI office bearers should be sacked and re-elected
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki sirf ipel chah hi nahin balki har satr main bhrashtachar kaa shaq rahaa he or isisi kii bhrashtachar nirodhak ikai ke purv adhyaksh sar paal condon ne 2008 main ipel ke pehle satr ke baad hi iske sanket die the
 Ranatunga said the fixing in the IPL has now been revealed, but since the first season in 2008, the needle of suspicion was on the league
 sar paal condon ne is par ek dastavej bhi isisi board ko diya tha
 He said, Sir Pal Kandon had said that after nineties, now IPL has emerged as an easy means of corruption in cricket
 yadi bisisiai ko vaaki cricket se bhrashtachar ko dur karnaa tha to usee samay karrwai kerani chahie thi
 He said, but the Indian board formed its own anti-corruption unit and some controversy was involved in every IPL
 yah cricket nahin balki cricket kaa tamaasha he or khilaadiyon ko laalchee bana rahaa he
 The comments kuch bhartiya satorion ke srilanka premier lig main kuch frenchiji ke benami maalik hone kii khabaron ke bare main poochne par rantunga ne kaha ki isaki jaanch honi chahie
 He said, i have also read such news
 main shuru se srilanka premier lig ke bhi khilaaf tha, kyonki mujhe andeshaa tha ki aisi kisi bhi lig ke saath gaiyr jaruri chijen bhi cricket main aa jaaengi
 If this is the case, it should be investigated
 rantunga ne yah bhi kaha ki ipel main aniyamittaaon kii swatantra jaanch honi chahie or sarkaar ko isamen dakhal dena chahie
 He said, Government of India should take BCCI under its umbrella as it is in Sri Lanka
 bisisiai ke maujuuda padaadhikariyon ko barkhaast karke nae sire se chayan hona chahie

 This fund has been given in the name of fighting Pakistan terrorism

 This has been confirmed in Pakistan newspaper 'the Dawn'
 america sansad kaa yah faislabharatako special states dene vaale bill ko paas na karne ke thik ek din baad aayaa he
 Until now, the US used to give funds to Pakistan and Afghanistan under the 'collation Support Fund (CSF)' to fight terrorism
 ab nayaa mechanism isaki jagah legaa

 isaki vajah se bharat america ke liye 'special' desh nahin ban sakaa
 This amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act was proposed by Senator John Mackin of Obama's anti-party Republican

 The Prime Minister constantly goes on foreign trips and Air India is used for this
 ye sab muft nahin hota he, balki centre kii tijori se is kharch kii bharpai kerani padati he, parantu pradhanmantri ke videshi dauron par kharch hue kareeb 500 karod rupee air india ko adaa karne main anakani kii ja rahi he
 Air India is already on the verge of sinking
 us par yah boj! bharat petroleum jaise munafa kamaane vaale saarvajanik upkram bhi centre bechney kii taiyaari main he
 The party said that in such a situation whether the states will get their GST back, it is doubtful
 maharashtra ko centre ne 15 hajaar karod rupee kaa ‘chuunaa’ lagaaya to ye rajya ke kisaanon or mehanatakashon se vishwasghaat siddh hoga
 Due to GST, there will be huge revenue growth in the economic vault of the country
 aarthik aabaadi aabaad hogi, aisa jo kaha gaya tha wo chhalaava hi tha

 RLD president Ajit Singh said during the 'dialogue with farmers' program in Kosikalan town that democracy is very important that if the country finds a wrong prime minister then you have the right to leave it in five years
 unhone kaha, ‘‘main aajkal akhabaaron main pard rahaa hum ki aajkal aapke gaay-bail-bachade khub gum rahe hai
 You are closing them in schools and colleges
 jinhen log kehete hai ki ye modi-yogi gum rahe hai, sach he kya?’’ singh ne kaha, ‘‘kuch log to yah bhi kehete hai ki hatti-katti gaay aa gai
 Smriti Irani is also wandering
 ’’ ralod adhyaksh ne apane puure bhaashan main pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhaa

 vaise bhi, pradhanmantri, mukhyamantri evam kapadaa mantri sanvaidhanik padon par baithe raajnneetik log hai, jin par abhadra tippanee karnaa desh ke samvidhan ke apmaan ke samaan he
 He said that making such remarks towards any woman is against Indian culture and it does not suit the head of any political party

 Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari told NDTV India that Manish Sisodia alleges that the BJP is opposing the free travel scheme in buses and metros
 vesarasar jhooth bol rahe hai ham to janata ke har us suvidha ke samarthak hai jo janata ko milti he 
 We are not opposed to the free scheme, we are opposed to the free declaration
 jo yah muft main ghoshnaa kar rahe hai juthi ghoshnaaen kar rahe hai
 Where are we protesting? We did a press conference on the very first day and said that the idea is very good, but these liars only make announcements
 chunaav aane par pani kii ghoshnaa thi, lekin log aaj gater kaa pani pine ko majaboor hai
 Electricity was announced at half-rate
 aaj half rate chhodie 3 guna zyada rate par bijli mil rahi he
 Fix charge is also increased
 ab chunaav najadik haito inhone usko hataane kii prakriya shuru kii he
 Now we are also demanding that whatever amount you took by increasing the fix rate, return it to the people of Delhi
 manoj tiwari ne kaha ki ham to dilli kii janata ko ayushmaan yojana ke tahat muft ilaaj dene kii baat kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, how can we be opposed to such a scheme
 unhone kaha kiayushmaan bharat yojana par arvind kejariwal ne doctor harshavardhan ko chitthee likhakar kaha he ki dilli kii yojana ayushmaan yojana se behatar he isliye dilli main ayushmaan bharat yojana lagu nahin hogi
 Today i make two demands from Arvind Kejriwal
 pehla- aap shwet patr jari karke yah bataao ki aapane dilli main apni yojana se kitne logon kaa ilaaj karavaaya
 Our data is before you
 doosraa- unhone bahut hi ghaatak baat likhi he
 It is written that only very poor people benefit from Ayushman Bharat scheme
 to behad garib ke kyon dushman ban gaye arvind kejariwal aap? aap jo bhi yojana de rahe ho agar centre bhi koi yojana de rahaa he to usko rokane kii kya jarurat he
 Let both of them answer Dr
 Harsh Vardhan ji for their questions, but if you are doing what you are doing then what is the problem in you manoj tiwari ne kaha ki asal main arvind kejariwal ji kii haalat kharaab he, kyonki unhone 5 saal main to kuch kiya nahin jabaki 5 saal main narendra modi ne kaam karke garibon ke dil main jagah bana lee he
 Actually his problem is that he cannot come back from this negativity, if the Ayushman Bharat scheme is to be implemented in 5 months, then do not do it or else you will get the people of Delhi removed from BJP

 He has said that there is pressure on the state officials to do what the Trinamool Congress does
 mahila adhikari kaa aarope he ki midanapur main bhaajapa kaa janaadhar badhane kii vajah se unhen darkinar kar diya gaya tha
 Please tell that Bharti Ghosh has been the Superintendent of Police in Midnapore
 bharti ghosh ne tivi today network se baatcheet main is baat kaa khulaasa kiya he
 Bharti Ghosh says the state's director general of police (DGP) had reprimanded her for not working according to the Trinamool and tried to isolate her
 bataa den ki jabaran vasuuli ke ek kathith maamle main bharti ghosh ke khilaaf siaidi ne chhapemari kii thi, jiske baad unhone ipies pad se istipha de diya tha
 On the question of extortion, she says that she resigned from her post against the dictatorship of the state government and senior officers
 baharhaal bharti ghosh ne kaha, ‘midanapur upachunaav main bhaajapa kaa mat pratishat badhane ke kaaran mujhe darkinar kar diya gaya
 He said that if the Mamta government feels that the bjp's base is growing in the state then it starts transferring officers
 afasaron par tiemasi kii party line par chalane kaa dabaav rahata he
 Bharti Ghosh said, 'I had conducted a fair election in Midnapore due to which the ruling party got angry with them
 kyonki is chunaav main bhaajapa kaa janaadhar badha tha
 He said, 'I did not follow his (trinamool) political order, that is why they filed a fake case of extortion against me
 main apane atmasamman se tabhi samjhauta nahin kar sakati
 i cannot follow the path of any political party
 mere apane vasuul or siddhant hai
 Not every officer can walk on the line of a political party

 Why Bharti Ghosh resigned from his post on 26 December 2017 after BJP got 37000 votes in the Sabang Assembly by-election in Trinamoolmidanapur
 bataa den ki 2014 main loksabhaa chunaavon main is kshetra main bhaajapa ko 5000 vot mili the
 But due to increasing bjp's support base in the assembly by-elections, Bharti Ghosh was reprimanded by her senior officials and Trinamool leaders and was sidelined
 ek report ke mutabik sabang vidhansabha upachunaav ke baad unka tabadalaa kar diya gaya tha
 Due to this, he later resigned from his post

 If anyone becomes an owl in electoral politics, it is our youth
 pehle use narebaazi ke laayak banaaya jaataa he phir uske bheetar nishtha banaai jaati he phir use jhanda lahraane ke kaam main laga diya jaataa he
 In this work, he is always engaged, so he is embroiled in the debates of Hindu vs Muslim, Secular vs Secular type, from where his politicization is perpetuated by the arguments of Focht and according to his left to right Fits into uski laachaari tab samaj aati he jab wo jaays sawaalon ko lekar awaz uthaata he
 The result is that he keeps eating sticks, making posters on the walls and sleeping on the streets
 saare raajnneetik dal use chhod jate hai
 The youth at the time of election becomes like a jackal of the story, in which someone keeps spreading panic in the name of 'huvan Huvan' pune main epa tii ai ai main chal rahe andolan ko dekh lijie
 He was called as a Naxalite
 dilli vishvavidhyalay main aam taur par chaatr andolan maamuli kamyaabi ke baad samaapt hone ke liye abhishpt rahete hai
 Today, a student got a call that he wants to demonstrate against the government that the students of Delhi University are not getting jobs
 aisa isliye karnaa chaahate hai taaki sarkaar kaa dhyaan jaae
 There is no political forum in universities across the country to talk about what is happening in the name of left to right
 chunaav ke baad koi rajnatik dal aisa forum bananaa bhi nahin chahta, taaki uski javabdehi par sawaal uthe
 As a result, he makes appointments through the back door, manages to impose his views, changes course in the name of bringing justice to the alleged injustice happening to great men

 is biodeta ko pandicherry unvarsity teachers association kii website puta
 org
 in par bhi daalaa he
 There is also a claim that whatever the Vice Chancellor has stated in his curriculum vitae, if it is accepted as true, then he is nothing compared to the other two candidates
 pandicherry vishvavidhyalay kii vischancelar chandra krishnamurti chauthi baar is pad par hai
 While he did peachad in 2002
 shikshakon or chaatro kaa daawa he ki unhone apane biodeta main teen kitaaben likhane kaa daawa kiya he
 When information was asked from the publishers, it was found that two of his books have never been published
 teesri kitaab jo prakashit hui he usamen paaya gaya ki 98 pratishat jaankaree anya jagah se uthaai gai he
 After 98 percent what is left for original writing
 agar aisa he to kya do din ke bheetar hamaari maanav sansaadhan mantri pataa nahin laga saktin
 Teachers have already done phd on Vice Chancellor's curriculum vitae
 unka daawa he ki chandra krishnamurthi ne 25 paper likhane kaa daawa kiya he
 Some of these have been published by the Council of India and some by the Law University of Bangalore
 aar tii ai se jutai gai jaankaree se pataa chalaa ki aisi jagahon par inkaa koi lekh prakashit nahin hua he
 He even claimed in his curriculum vitae to have secured first place in the first class in the examination of LLB and LLM
 lekin aar tii ai se jo unki sarvice book nikaali gai he, usase pataa chalata he ki ve second class main paas hui hai
 There are many things that must be investigated
 visi kaa bhi paksh saamne aana chahie
 Which is not even in this article
 pandicherry vishvavidhyalay ke chaatro or shikshakon kaa yah bhi daawa he ki vaais chancelar ne niyuktiyon main bhi manamaani kii he
 They all have a long list
 is tarah ke daawey bhi hai ki visi ne apane ghar main shauchalay banane par gyaarah lakh rupee kharch kiye hai
 Two cars have been purchased with government money
 in logon ne raashtrapati, pradhanmantri or kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri smriti ko bhi likhaa he
 If our institutes were run professionally, then all these allegations could be investigated in a month and the students would not have trouble eating sticks
 kulapati bhi apni taraf se bayaan jari kar sakati thim
 Which mountain will break if the Vice Chancellor will give public answer to the students' questions
 phir kis baat ke liye ham 'loktantr loktantr' karte rahete hai
 The comments chaatro kaa daawa he ki pichley ek hafte se andolan chal rahaa he
 VC did not even talk by calling
 ulta police bulavaa kar pitayee karvaa di
 Such news keeps coming from other universities of the country
 aisa nahin hai ki yah sab nai sarkaar ke aane se ho rahaa he
 This has been happening since long time ago
 madhya pradesh or bihar se bhi kulapatiyon ko lekar shikaayatein aa rahi hai
 Movements are going on
 maakhan laal patrakarita vishvavidhyalay ke chaatro ne bhi fasebuk ke inbox main kaaphi kuch likhaa tha ki hamaare yahaan thik nahin chal rahaa he
 But there is no hearing anywhere
 hamaari media main bhi nahin he
 Shows are made for the youth, but there is no place for the questions of the youth
 vishvavidhyalayon se yahi khabar aati rahati he ki itihaas badalane vaala he
 But there was talk of changing the future, why is history changing
 isliye ki raajnneeti na badale
 Therefore, the youth should only cheer Netaji
 acchhee baat ye he ki yuva is khel ko samaj rahe hai
 Universities are demanding quality and professional arrangements
 bhale hi beete pandrah saalon main na kar paayen ho magar kar to rahe hai
 Then when their struggle does not find a place in the media and politics, how can it be claimed that even in the last fifteen years, there were no movements
 sawaal nahin uthe

 pandicherry vishvavidhyalay kii vischancelar chandra krishnamurti chauthi baar is pad par hai
 While he did peachad in 2002
 shikshakon or chaatro kaa daawa he ki unhone apane biodeta main teen kitaaben likhane kaa daawa kiya he
 When information was asked from the publishers, it was found that two of his books have never been published
 teesri kitaab jo prakashit hui he usamen paaya gaya ki 98 pratishat jaankaree anya jagah se uthaai gai he
 After 98 percent what is left for original writing
 agar aisa he to kya do din ke bheetar hamaari maanav sansaadhan mantri pataa nahin laga saktin
 Teachers have already done phd on Vice Chancellor's curriculum vitae
 unka daawa he ki chandra krishnamurthi ne 25 paper likhane kaa daawa kiya he
 Some of these have been published by the Council of India and some by the Law University of Bangalore
 aar tii ai se jutai gai jaankaree se pataa chalaa ki aisi jagahon par inkaa koi lekh prakashit nahin hua he
 He even claimed in his curriculum vitae to have secured first place in the first class in the examination of LLB and LLM
 lekin aar tii ai se jo unki sarvice book nikaali gai he, usase pataa chalata he ki ve second class main paas hui hai
 There are many things that must be investigated
 visi kaa bhi paksh saamne aana chahie
 Which is not even in this article
 pandicherry vishvavidhyalay ke chaatro or shikshakon kaa yah bhi daawa he ki vaais chancelar ne niyuktiyon main bhi manamaani kii he
 They all have a long list
 is tarah ke daawey bhi hai ki visi ne apane ghar main shauchalay banane par gyaarah lakh rupee kharch kiye hai
 Two cars have been purchased with government money
 in logon ne raashtrapati, pradhanmantri or kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri smriti ko bhi likhaa he
 If our institutes were run professionally, then all these allegations could be investigated in a month and the students would not have trouble eating sticks
 kulapati bhi apni taraf se bayaan jari kar sakati thim
 Which mountain will break if the Vice Chancellor will give public answer to the students' questions
 phir kis baat ke liye ham 'loktantr loktantr' karte rahete hai
 The comments chaatro kaa daawa he ki pichley ek hafte se andolan chal rahaa he
 VC did not even talk by calling
 ulta police bulavaa kar pitayee karvaa di
 Such news keeps coming from other universities of the country
 aisa nahin hai ki yah sab nai sarkaar ke aane se ho rahaa he
 This has been happening since long time ago
 madhya pradesh or bihar se bhi kulapatiyon ko lekar shikaayatein aa rahi hai
 Movements are going on
 maakhan laal patrakarita vishvavidhyalay ke chaatro ne bhi fasebuk ke inbox main kaaphi kuch likhaa tha ki hamaare yahaan thik nahin chal rahaa he
 But there is no hearing anywhere
 hamaari media main bhi nahin he
 Shows are made for the youth, but there is no place for the questions of the youth
 vishvavidhyalayon se yahi khabar aati rahati he ki itihaas badalane vaala he
 But there was talk of changing the future, why is history changing
 isliye ki raajnneeti na badale
 Therefore, the youth should only cheer Netaji
 acchhee baat ye he ki yuva is khel ko samaj rahe hai
 Universities are demanding quality and professional arrangements
 bhale hi beete pandrah saalon main na kar paayen ho magar kar to rahe hai
 Then when their struggle does not find a place in the media and politics, how can it be claimed that even in the last fifteen years, there were no movements
 sawaal nahin uthe
 After the election, no political party even wants to be such a forum so that its accountability will be questioned
 nateeja wo pichley darvaaze se niyuktiyaan karata he, apane vichaar thopane kaa prabandh karata he, mahapurushon ke saath ho rahe kathith anyaayon ko insaaf dene ke naam par course badalane lagata he
 In this sequence, one takes advantage of cbse's directory and puts Asaram Bapu and Ramdev in the category of saints like Vivekananda, Mother Teresa and Buddha in the third grade book
 itani baat isliye kahi taaki aap ko bataa sakuun ki pandicherry vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr laathiyaan kha rahe hai
 They change
 org par ek yachika daali he
 These students allege that the thirty-year-old vice-chancellor of this central university, who has written in his curriculum vitae, is wrong
 chaatro ne soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat unka biodeta hasil kar daawa kiya he ki agar koi apane bare main itani galat jaankaree de saktaa he to wo chaatro ko shreshth banane kaa naitik daawa bhi kaise kar saktaa he
 This curriculum vitae puta website of Pondicherry University Teachers Association
 org
 is also put on in ek daawa yah bhi he ki vaais chancelar ne apane biodeta main jo bhi bataaya he agar use sahi bhi maan liya jaae to wo do anya ummidavaaron ke mukaable main kuch bhi nahin hai
 Pondicherry University Vice Chancellor Chandra Krishnamurthy holds the post for the fourth time
 jabaki unhone pichaedi 2002 main kii he
 Teachers and students claim to have written three books in their curriculum vitae
 prakashkon se jaankaree maangi gai to pataa chalaa ki unki do kitaab kabhi prakashit hi nahin hui he
 In the third book which has been published, it was found that 98 percent information has been picked up from elsewhere
 98 pratishat ke baad moulik lekhan ke liye bachataa hi kya he
 If this is the case, then our HR Minister cannot find out within two days
 shikshakon ne to vaais chancelar ke biodeta par piechdi hi kar daali he
 He claims to have written 25 papers by Chandra Krishnamurthy
 inamen se kuch baar council aaf india ne prakashit kiya he to kuch neshal lau uniwarsity bangaloru ne
 Information gathered from RTI revealed that no such articles have been published in such places
 yahaan tak ki unhone apane biodeta main daawa kiya he ki el el bi or el el em ke imtahaan main pratham shrenee main pratham sthaan hasil kiya he
 But the service book that has been extracted from RTI shows that she has passed in second class
 aisi kai baaten hai jinaki jaanch to honi hi chahie
 The side of the VC should also come to the fore
 jo ki is lekh main bhi nahin he
 Pondicherry University students and teachers also claim that the Vice Chancellor has made arbitrary appointments
 in sabaki ek lambii fehrist di gai he
 There are also claims that the VC has spent eleven lakh rupees to build toilets in his house
 sarkari paise se do do kaaren khridi gayi hai
 These people have also written to the President, Prime Minister and Union Human Resource Minister Smriti
 agar hamaare santhaan peshewar tareeke se chalate to in sab aaropon kii ek maheene main jaanch ho sakati thi or chaatro ko lathi khaane kii naubat nahin aati
 The Vice Chancellor could also issue a statement on his own behalf
 aisa koun sa pahaad tut jayega ki agar kulapati chaatro ke sawaalon kaa saarvajanik jawaab de dengi to
 Then for what we keep doing 'democracy democracy'
 tippaniyan Students claim that the movement has been going on for the past one week
 visi ne bulaakar baat tak nahin kii
 On the contrary, the police were called and beaten
 desh ke anya vishvavidhyalay se bhi aisi khabaren aati rahati hai
 It is not that all this is happening with the new government
 bahut pehle se yah ho rahaa he
 Complaints are being received from the vice-chancellors from Madhya Pradesh and Bihar as well
 andolan chal rahe hai
 Students of Makhan Lal Journalism University also wrote a lot in Facebook inbox that we are not doing well here
 magar kahin koi sunwaayee nahin he
 Neither is there in our media
 yuvaaon ke liye sho ban jate hai, magar yuvaaon ke sawaalon ke liye kahin koi jagah nahin he
 The same news keeps coming from universities that history is about to change
 par badalane kii baat to bhavishya kii ho rahi thi, itihaas kyon badal rahaa he
 Because politics does not change
 isliye yuva sirf netaji ke jayakaare lagaaye
 The good thing is that the youth are understanding this game
 vishvavidhyalayon main gunvattta or peshewar vyavastha kii maang kar rahe hai
 Even if you have not been able to do it in the last fifteen years, but you are doing it
 phir jab inkaa sangharsh media or raajnneeti main jagah hi nahin paata to kaise daawa kiya ja saktaa he ki beete pandrah saalon main bhi andolan nahin hue
 Questions did not arise
 itani baat isliye kahi taaki aap ko bataa sakuun ki pandicherry vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr laathiyaan kha rahe hai
 They change
