 Congress seats in Haryana increased: BJP may have emerged as the largest party in the new Haryana jjp's new Gadharyana Assembly elections, but the lotus color is fading in Jatland region
 isi kaa nateeja he ki bijepi apane dam par bahumat ke jaadui aankade ko nahin chhu pai he
 While the Congress, led by Bhupendra Singh Hooda, has surprised everyone by saving its fort as well as winning a landslide victory in the 'fort Belt' area of BJP
 vahiin, inelo kii siyaasi jameen par kabja kar dushyant chautaala ne pashchim haryana ko apana garh banaaya he
 Out of the 90 assembly seats in Haryana, BJP won 40, Congress 31, JJP 10, Independents 7, Haryana Janhit Party 1 and INLD won 1
 congress ne jiti belt or jatlent ilaake main jeet darj kii he to bijepi dakshin haryana or pashchim haryana kii badaulat duusari baar satta kii dahalij par khadi he
 GT Belt: Congress snatches bjp's GT Belt area of haryana, Panchkula, Ambala, Kurukshetra, Yamunanagar, Karnal, Panipat and Kaithal districts
 is ilaake main kul 27 vidhansabha siten aati hai
 In 2014, the BJP formed the government due to this area, but this time the lotus has not blossomed here
 jiti belt ilaake kii 27 main se bijepi ko 14, congress ko 9, jejepi ko 2 or nirdaleey ko 2 siton par jiti mili he
 In 2014, BJP won 22 seats from here
 jabaki, congress-inelo ko ek-ek seat or teen nirdaleey seat jite the
 Apart from this, four seats went to inld's account
 is tarah se bijepi ko aath siton kaa nuksaan hua he to congress ko itani hi siton kaa phayda mila he
 Jatland: The magic of Hooda comes from the Jatland area of haryana in Rohtak, Sonipat, Jhajjar, Jind, Bhiwani and Charkhi Dadri districts
 is ilaake main kul 25 vidhansabha siten aati hai, jinamein se bijepi ko 7, congress 12, jejepi ko 4 or nirdaleey 2 siton par jeet darj kii he
 In 2014, in Jatland area, BJP won 8, Congress 11, Elano 5 and one seat won by independents
 is tarah se congress kii ek seat badi he to bijepi ko ek seat kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa he
 While JJP has replaced INLD
 dakshin haryana: congress ko badhat to bijepi yathavatadakshin haryana ke tahat gudgaanv,rewadi, mahendragarh, nunh, palavalaur faridabad jile aate hai
 The region has 23 assembly seats, out of which BJP has 15, Congress 6 and two others
 2014 ke chunaav main is ilaake kii 14 siten bijepi ko mili thi to congress ko 4 siten ai thim
 Apart from this, four INLD and one seat were won by independents
 is tarah se congress ko do siton kaa phayda hua he to bijepi ko bhi ek seat kaa laabh mila he
 In this way, bjp's performance in South Haryana has been better than other areas
 pashchim haryana: jejepi kaa bana gadhpaschim haryana main ke tahat hisar, sirsa, fatehabad jile aate hai
 There are a total of 15 assembly seats in this area, out of which BJP has 4, Congress 3 and JJP five
 iske alaava inelo ko ek seat mili he or ek seat par gopal kanda ne jeet darj kii he
 Whereas in 2014 elections BJP got 3 seats and INLD got 8 seats
 jabaki congress is ilaake main khaataa bhi nahin khol saki thi
 In such a situation, Congress has improved its performance, so BJP has gained one seat

 There is a belief in Hinduism that the God who runs the world is present in every particle
 ishwar jagat main anant rup main vidyaman hai
 The observance of the world is a welfare vow to make one realize the eternity of the Lord, which is celebrated as 'anant Chaturdashi'
 bhadrapada maas ke shuklapaksh kii chaturdashi ko 'anant chaturdashi' kaha jaataa he
 On this day, the infinite sutra is tied on the arm of the worshiper of eternal God (srihari)
 bhakton kaa aisa vishwaas he ki anant sutara dhaaran karne se har tarah kii museebaton se raksha hoti he
 Along with this, there is welfare of the seekers in every way

 When the Pandavas were wandering one by one after losing their kingdom in gambling, Lord Krishna asked them to fast on the eternal Chaturdashi

 Since then the practice of this fast started
 vrath karne vaale shraddhalu bhagwaan vishnu yaa shrikrishna rup kii puja karte hai

 puja ke baad purush sutara ko apane daahine haath par, jabaki striyaan baayen haath par baandhti hai
 This fast is prevalent in many parts of India
 purna vishwaas ke saath vrath karne par yah anant faldaayi hota he
 The mantra to tie the infinite sutra is like this: Ananta Sansar Mahasamudremagnam Sambhyudhar Vasudeva

 In the first budget of 0, the focus has been placed on the farmers and the village, as well as increasing the tax burden on the millionaires
 lekin, middle class ko jis tex main chhot kii aas thi, sarkaar kii ore se us par dhyaan hi nahin diya gaya he
 The government's focus on 'new India' Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in his speech once again stated his goal till 2022
 svachh bharat ho, har ghar jal ho, har kisi ko ghar ho yaa phir bijli, har yojana kaa lakshya 2022 tak hi rakhaa gaya he
 Nirmala Sitharaman has declared that the focus of the government is that by 2022 1
 92 karod ghar die jaaen
 So far, more than 9 crore toilets have been built in the country, they should be increased further
 saath hi har ghar, har nal main svachh pani ke liye 1,500 block kaa chayan bhi kiya gaya he
 Tax hit on the rich, but like the middle class forgotten Bhulehar Bar, this time the middle class was eyeing the tax slab
 lekin vitt mantri ne selary class ko niraash kiya
 Whether it is 2 lakh or three lakh or even a person with an income of 10 lakh, no one is relieved
 tex slab main kisi tarah kaa change nahin he, lekin amiron par is baar tex kaa bhaar badhaayaa gaya he
 Those whose income is between 2 crore and 5 crore will be charged an additional cess of 3 per cent
 vahiin, 5 karod se adhik kii salanaa aay waalon par 7 fisadi kaa ses thoka gaya he
 Emphasis on start-up, round-the-clock employment minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget speech has made various announcements for startups to promote the youth
 ab start ap karne waalon ko shuruaati teen saal main iskar vibhaag kii taraf se koi dabaav nahin banaaya jayega
 Also, the start up of start up has been exempted from the angel tax
 lekin bajet main rojgaar par kisi tarah kaa jor nahin diya gaya he
 Unemployment has been a big issue in the last five years but there is no response to how this challenge will be dealt with in this budget

 In such a situation, they have given big relief to women in their first budget
 ab jandhan khatadharak mahilaon ko 5,000 rupee overdraft kii suvidhaayen di jaaengi
 Apart from this, women with self health group will also be given a loan of Rs 1 lakh under Mudra loan

 a new draft will be prepared on higher education, the government will also release a budget of 400 crores for this
 itnaa hi nahin, nai shiksha niti laai jaaegi

 vitt mantri ne ‚Äòadhyayan‚Äô yojana kaa elaan kiya he, jiske tahat videshi chaatro ko bharat bulaayaa jayega or study in india campan ke tahat unhen desh kii sabhyataa ke bare main sikhaaya jayega
 In the last term, a big scheme like Ayushman Bharat was implemented by the government
 lekin is kaarykaal ke pehle hi bajet main hi sarkaar kii taraf se healthsector main kisi tarah kii nai baat kaa zikr nahin kiya gaya he
 Increase in petrol and diesel prices, e-vehicle is being monitored by the government, this time the emphasis is on e-vehicle
 iske liye unamem badi chhot bhi gai he, jise 12 fisadi se ghataakar 5 fisadi vaale GST slab main shaamil kar diya gaya he
 On the other hand, additional cess of Rs 1 each has been imposed on petrol and diesel
 sarkaar kii koshish he ki aam log i-whical ko jald se jald apanaaen, sirf GST main chhot hi nahin balki anya kai laabh bhi logon ko die ja rahe hai
 The Prime Minister appreciated the Congress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi described this budget as brilliant and described it as beneficial to the poor
 bajet ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane sambodhan main kaha ki is bajet se garib ko bal milegaa, yuva ko behatar kal milegaa
 This budget carries forward the vision of 'new India'
 vahiin duusari taraf congress kii taraf se is bajet ko nai bottle main puraani sharaab kaha gaya he, itnaa hi nahin vipaksh kaa aarope he ki bajet main berogari par kuch nahin kaha gaya he

 rajya ke swasthya mantri nitin patel or gujarat ke bijepi pramukh philhal daud main sabase aage chal rahe hai
 BJP President Amit Shah said that the party's highest body, the Parliamentary Board, will decide who will replace Anandiben Patel
 unhone kaha ki anandiben ne siem pad isliye choda he kyonki ve jald hi 75 varsh kii ho jaaengi or unhone yuvaaon ko protsaahit karne ke liye bujurg netaaon ke ritair karne ke party ke siddhant kaa sammaan kiya he
 Anandiben has been accused of not properly 'handling' the anger of the Dalits who emerged due to the brutal beating of four youths by two key developments in Gujarat, the Patel agitation and cow guards
 aise main unke uttaradhikari ke saamne 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke pehle chizon ko praathamikta ke aadhaar par thik karne kii kathin chunauti hogi
 Local BJP leaders have complained that the popularity that the party gained during its nearly 25-year rule has been harmed by Anandiben, but according to sources close to 'CM', Anandiben believes that the agitations were opposed by her opponents in the party He gave wind tippaniyan Significantly, after bjp's bumper victory in the Lok Sabha elections and PM Modi's move to Delhi, Narendra Modi chose Anandiben as the Chief Minister of Gujarat

 In the case of encroachment around Haji Ali Dargah of Mumbai, the Supreme Court asked the Maharashtra government to remove the encroachment from the area as per the court's order
 court ne sarkaar se kaha ki hamane pehle bhi yahi kaha tha lekin lagata he ki aap court ke aadesh kaa paalan nahin karnaa chaahate
 You must remove encroachment from the area
 ilaake main kisi ko bhi koi kanoonee sangrakshan praapt nahin he
 In fact, the Maharashtra government argued in the Supreme Court that during the process of removing encroachment in the area, there is a possibility of deterioration of law and order as this area also has a religious site
 teen july ko supreme court ne maharashtra sarkaar ko do hafte main dargah ke aasapaas 908 varg meter ilaake main atikaraman ko hataane ke aadesh die the
 The court said that if the order is not followed, there will be serious consequences
 maharashtra sarkaar ko kaha ki dargah ke aasapaas saundaryikaran karnaa jaruri he
 After the order of the High Court, now the Supreme Court has also issued orders, then you have to do this
 isse pehle dargah trust ne atikaraman hataaya tha lekin abhi bhi ilaake main atikaraman bachaa he
 Now that the Dargah has expressed its inability to remove it, the Supreme Court has issued this order
 pichhali sunwaayee main supreme court ne biemasi se kaha tha ki haji ali dargah kaa saundaryikaran hona hi chahie
 Either approve or amend the beautification plan given by BMC Dargah Trust or tell your own plan
 court ne kaha tha ki 30 june tak biemasi plan supreme court main daakhil karen

 court ne trust ko kaha he ki chaar hafte main baaki atikaraman bhi hataaen
 The Dargah Trust has submitted a beautification scheme to the court
 mumbai kii haji ali dargah ke paas atikaraman ke maamle main supreme court main ahm sunwaayee chal rahi he
 Earlier in the hearing, the court had said that the encroachment in the 737 square meter area near the Dargah would be removed and the Dargah Trust itself would remove the encroachment

 haalanki court ne kaha tha ki 171 varg meter main bani masjid main todphod nahin hogi
 The Supreme Court, on the orders of the High Court, prohibited the demolition action of the Special Task Force set up for sabotage
 supreme court ne trust ko haji ali ke saundaryikaran or suvidhaon ko badhaane ke liye yojana banaakar dene ko hari jhandi dikhaai thi
 The Supreme Court has ordered that no court will issue any order on this issue
 kisi pakshakaar ko dikkat he to wo supreme court aa saktaa he
 The Supreme Court issued notice to the parties in the High Court
 tippaniyan In fact, on 22 March 2017, Bombay High Court had ordered removal of encroachment in 908 square meter area here
 haji ali dargah trust ne supreme court main chunauti di thi

 lekin trust ye sunishchit kare ki baaki atikaraman ko hataane main wo athurity kii madad karegaa or masjid ko lekar wo baad main sunwaayee karegaa

 logon ko dargah tak pahunchane main dikkat hoti he
 The court said that people of religion should play the action of removing encroachment
 dargah trust kii ore se kaha gaya tha ki hoicourt kaa aadesh sahi nahin he
 This mosque is very old and has been with him since 1931
 hai court ke ilaake main todphod ke aadesh par roak lagaai jaani chahie
 On July 3, the Supreme Court ordered the Maharashtra government to remove the encroachment in the 908 square meter area around the Dargah in two weeks
 court ne kaha tha ki agar aadesh kaa paalan nahin hua to gambhir parinaam honge
 The Maharashtra government said that beautification around the dargah is necessary
 hai court ke aadesh ke baad ab supreme court ne bhi aadesh jari kar die hai to aapako ye karnaa hoga
 Earlier the encroachment was removed by the Dargah Trust but there is still encroachment in the area

 If you also have twins in your house and they look like you, how do you identify them? Many people wear different clothes to children, while many have long hair and short hair
 pareshaani tab or bad jaati he jab teen bachche hon or teenon hamshakl bhi
 What would you devise to identify these identical children? When both the avatars of Salman Khan in the film Judwaa come in the same dress, their wives also do not recognize them
 haalanki hema malini kii film ‚Äòsita or gita‚Äô, dilip kumaar kii film ‚Äòram or shyaam‚Äô va shridevi kii ‚Äòchalbaaj‚Äô main donon judwa hamashaklon ko aasaani se pahachaanaa ja saktaa tha

 There is always a three color nail polish in his house
 wo hameshaa apane teenon bacchon ko purple, ski blue or pink color kii nail polish lagaakar rakhti hai, taaki unki pahchaan aasaani se ho sake
 According to Gilbert, even without nail polish, she is unable to identify her three children
 unke pati ian bhi aksar apane bacchon ko nail polish ke bina dekhne par pahchaanane main galati kar jate hai
 However, they had adopted several methods before arriving at this method to identify the three children
 ve pehle teenon bacchon ko hospital brestlate pahanaate the, lekin unhen kuch hi hafton badalanaa padataa tha, kyonki ve tite hone lagate the
 In addition, he also used the first marker to identify all three, but the ink of the marker was erased in water
 antat: gilbert kaa dimag chalaa or unhone teenon ke nakhunon par alag-alag rang kii nail polish laga di, ab unhen pahchaanana aasaan hota he

 Salman Khan Kevkilashrikant Shivde has raised many important questions in the court in the hit and run case
 unhone kaha, 'is cese mensalmaan khanka finger print kyon liya gaya tha jab use saboot ke taur par dikhaanaa hi nahin janaa tha? jab police ko pataa tha kii gaadi main teen hi log the to steering, wheel or salmaan khan ke finger print hi kyon liye gaye?, finger print ko forensik jaanch ke liye kyun bheja gaya? or phir uski report sabooton ke saath kyon nahin lagaayi gayi?' salmaan ke vakil ne kaha kii forensik report police cese ke paksh main nahin thi isiilie report ko adaalat ke saamne nahin laayaa gaya
 In this case, the police had many flaws in the hotel 'JW Marriott', the disappearance of the Vale parking tag and not taking the statement of the Vale driver who parked the car of Salman Khan that night, even the lawyer of the court said in the court that they said The investigation had many flaws from the beginning
 police ne jab is maamle main exiaar lete hue shikayakarta rabindra patil kaa bayaan darj kiya tha tab kahin bhi rabindra patil ne yah nahin kaha tha kii salmaan ne sharaab pi rakhi thi
 This was the reason that the IPC sections of Drunken Driving were not initially introduced in the case
 sharaab kaa zikr rabindra patil ke supplementry bayaan main aayaa tha or uske baad hi dhara 304 (2) lagaai gai
 The mention of alcohol was the brainchild of the police
 sharaab pine ke daawey hai saraasar jhuthesalmaan ke vikal kaa yah bhi kahana he ki 'rain' baar ke jo bill court main bataur saboot jamaa karwaae gaye he wo farji he
 The Chief Investigating Officer of this case, Kishan Shengal, has manipulated it
 mannu khan naam ke chashmadid or jakhmi gavaah ne court ko bataaya he kii uskaa magistrate ke saamne siarpisi kii dhara 164 ke tahat jo bayaan darj karaayaa gaya tha us dauraan police ne uskaa likhit statement magistrate ko dikhaaya or baad main usapar uske dastakhat liye
 Salman's lawyer told the court that by taking such statements under 164, the magistrate and the police made a mockery of the law
 kyonki gavaah ne kaha he ki use pataa nahin tha kii us statement main kya baaten likhi hui he aar wo sahi he yaa galat yah bhi nahin pataa tha
 The witness has also said that in which language the statement was written, he does not know
 164 ke bayaan lene kii prakriya kaa bilkul bhi dhyaan nahin rakhaa gaya he jiske liye doshiyon ko kadi sajaa milani chahie
 The government side did not present any such evidence nor did any witness directly state that Salman had drunk alcohol on the night of the incident
 jaanch adhikari ne court se chhipaayin batenis cese ke pehle jaanch adhikari ne apane bayaan main kaha he ki unke jaanch chhodane tak salmaan giraftaar nahin hue the jabakislamangiraftaar 28 taarikh ke savere 11 baje hue or pehle jaanch adhikari ne jaanch 29 taarikh ko chodi
 Then why did the investigating officer hide this thing from the court
 salmaan ke vakil ke mutabik vah salmaan khan ke khun ke storage or duusare sawaalon ke jawaab nahin dena chaahate the isiilie aisa kaha
 The Chief Investigating Officer of this case prepared wrong statements and evidence to appease his senior officers so that Section 304 (2) could be imposed against Salman Khan
 doctor ne diya jhootha bayaan'je je hospital' main salmaan ke aane kaa vakt 2
 25 is written and time to leave is 2
 30 likhaa gaya he
 According to the doctor's statement, Salman's BP was also checked in these 5 minutes, a respiratory test was done, blood was extracted and Salman was also seen walking

 The Delhi government may have called a one-day assembly session but the BJP demonstrated fiercely near the Delhi Assembly about this
 bijepi mahila wing ke kaaryakartaaon ne bijepi saansad ramesh bidhudi ke netritv main pradarshan kiya
 While the BJP raised the issue of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's non-attendance, Minister Sandeep Kumar demanded his resignation on the issue of sex scandal
 bijepi saansad ramesh bidhudi ne aarope lagaaya kisarkaar ke mantrior khud arvind kejariwal dilli se baahar rahete hai
 The Kejriwal government left the work of the people of Delhi and went to try their luck in Punjab and Goa
 gauratlab he ki philhal dilli ke mukhyamantriaravind kejarivalpunjab main hai to vahiin up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya bhi goa main AAP ke prachaar ke liye jane vaale hai, ab bijepi sawaal puch rahi he ki agar dilli waalon ke mudde ke liye sarkaar syrius hi nahin thi to phir vidhansabha kaa satr bulaayaa hi kyon gaya? Hello, Ravish Kumar
 ek din hamen samarthan dene par unhen afsos karnaa pad jayega
 When Arvind Kejriwal told Barkha Dutt with talakti strictness and a pinch, the opposition felt that Aaini was saying
 to kya wo ek din aaj aa gaya jis par congress ab afsos karegi yaa wo din abhi aane vaala he
 The Kejriwal government has strengthened the coalition by ordering an FIR against Sheila Dixit or jerking it before bringing the Jan Lokpal
 vaise exiaar yaa jail bhej dene se gathbandhan hameshaa tut hi jaataa ho, yah tathy nahin he
 Even after a Raja and Kanimozhi went to jail in the UPA Two's Tugi scandal, the stability of the alliance at that time did not matter
 jis tarah centre main diemke us vakt sahansheel ho gai, kya usee tarah dilli main congress yaa shila dikshit sahansheel ho jaaengi
 This is the basic kochhan
 vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan arvind kejariwal, shila dikshit ko target kiye rahe
 As the election drew near, Sheela started saying that there were no allegations
 kisi adaalat ne bhrasht sabit nahin kiya he
 Probably in search of the same allegations and facts, the Kejriwal government has decided to investigate on what basis, after rejecting the company that was given the contract to install street lights on the streets of Delhi during the Commonwealth Games
 Given
 aarope he ki saat aath hazaar kii street lite ko 31 hazaar tak main lagava kar dilli kii janata ko kathith rup se 31 karod kaa chuunaa laga diya gaya
 The FIR calls for an inquiry against the Chief Minister, ministers, PWD and MCD officials
 emsidi to bijepi ke tahat aati he
 Now the question arises whether the new government has got new evidence or the report of CAG and Shunglu Committee is sufficient
 sarkaar ne aaj kaha ki is maamle ko court nahin bheja gaya or praathmik jaanch ke str par hi band kar diya gaya
 So now the file will open
 vaise maamla yah he ki street lite lagane ke liye ek company spes age kaa aavedan riject ho gaya
 Due to a shortfall in four scales, he got 48 out of 100
 company ne sidhe mukhyamantri se apil kii or mukhyamantri ne kathith rup se file chif ejeeniyar ko bhej di
 The Chief Engineer sent his file back to the same board from where it was rejected
 is baar us company ke number 48 se 67 ho gaye
 The Shunglu Committee considered it serious
 hamaare paas company kaa koi paksh nahin he
 One more thing
 ek saath teen companiyaan riject huin thim
 Those two companies did not get a chance to put their case for reconsideration
 to is exiaar main ek saath congress or bijepi aa gai he
 Politically
 ab ek or maamla
 On 5 November 2013, the Lokayukta reported that the Sheila Dixit government had wrongly given provisional certificates authorizing colonies that did not exist for political gains
 certificket dene main supreme court ke dishanirdesh kaa bhi paalan nahin hua
 The Lokayukta sent this report to the President and the President sent it back for the Chief Minister's opinion
 28 disambar 2013 ko jab arvind kejariwal ne shapath lee tab yah file unhen viraasat main mili
 He wrote and sent it on this file that strict action should be taken on it
 bina colony main moolbhoot suvidhaayen uplabdh karaane kaa maamla raajnneetik he yaa isamen bhrashtachar hua he, in sawaalon par baat karenge
 But bjp's Dr
 Harsh Vardhan says that street light is a subject in the Commonwealth Games
 lagata he ki karpshan ke maamle skool kalege ke course kii tarah hone lage hai
 Dr
 Saheb says that there are many subjects ranging from rebuilding tissue paper stadium, to bridges, medicine, ambulances
 dilli sarkaar desh kii janata ko gumraah kar rahi he
 They have taken symbolic steps on our demands
 kya jaanch shuru hui he
 Vijender Gupta is saying that the Delhi government is saving Sheila Dixit
 congress or aam aadmi party, bijepi ko rokane main lage hai
 The Law Minister has also said that no one person will be targeted in the investigation
 par sawaal ye he ki arvind kejariwal jab bhi jaanch kii pahal karte hai, us par congress itani shaleen kyon ho jaati he
 The second question is what will the BJP believe that the Kejriwal government can take action against Sheila Dixit
 kya shila dikshit par exiaar darj kar kejariwal bijepi ke imtihaan main paas ho gaye
 Will the Congress come to the rescue of Sheila or leave it with two or four statements
 kya sahi main nai sarkaar ko aise thos saboot mili hai jo manshaa se aage jaakar mukhyamantri kii bhoomika sabit kar de

 Trinamool Congress leader Kalyan Banerjee wrote a letter to Speaker Sumitra Mahajan complaining that Union Minister Babul Supriyo had threatened and abused her in Parliament House
 babul supriyo bengal ke asanasol se bijepi ke saansad hai or shahari vikaas ke rajya mantri he jabaki kalyaan banerjee shrirampur se se tiemasi ke saansad hai or loksabhaa main party ke mukhya sachetak hai
 According to Banerjee, the incident took place on 2 March
 loksabhaa spikar sumitra mahajan ko yah chitthee bhi banerjee ne 2 march ko hi likhi he, jisamen unhone kaha he ki mantri babul supriyo ne unhen sansad ke bheetar roka or poocha ki unhone sadan main unke bare main galat baat kyon kahi? apni chitthee main kalyaan banerjee aarope lagaate hai ki supriyo ne unke saath abhadra bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya
 He then accused them of misrepresentation by going to his (supriyo's) parliamentary constituency and threatened them
 banerjee apni chitthee main likhte hai ki us vakt tiemasi saansad aparupa poddar vahaan maujuud thim or unhone ye sab hote hue dekha
 On the other hand, Union Minister Babul Supriyo has denied the allegations of Banerjee and said that she never did anything like this with Kalyan Banerjee
 sutron ke mutabik banerjee ne is bare main grahamantri rajnath singh or sansadeey kaary mantri vankeya naidu se bhi phone par shikaayat kii he or kaha he ki supriyo sadan main unke bolte vakt baar-baar unhen baithne kaa ishaara karte hai
 In fact, the political confrontation between TMC and BJP in West Bengal is intensifying
 supriyo asanasol se saansad hai or banerjee 2 baar asanasol se emele rah chuke hai
 Apart from MBBS across the country, there is a relief news for lakhs of candidates who are enrolled in other medical courses
 supreme court ne neshnal eligibity interest test yani NEET-1 kii pariksha de chuke chaatro ko bhi kuch sharton ke saath NEET-2 main baithne kii ijaajat de di he
 On Monday, a bench headed by Justice AR Dave gave this order
 rajyon kii arji ko khaarij karte hue supreme court ne is maamle main rajyon ko apni alag se pariksha lene kii ijaajat nahin di
 Admissions will be based on NEET-2, the court said in its judgment, 'students who have given NEET-1 examination understand that they did not get much time to take their exam in English instead of regional language and they prepared properly
 If not able, then such students can take the NEET-2 exam
 aise chaatro ko apane aavedan ke vakt pehle di ja chuki NEET-1 pariksha kii ummidavaari ko chhodani hogi
 Based on the NEET-2 examination, they will be selected and admissions will be taken
 alag se pariksha nahin kara paaenge rajyasupreme court ne apane faisle main ye bhi kaha he ki jo chaatr aavedan karne ke baavjood kisi vajah se NEET-1 kii pariksha dene se chook gaye, wo bhi NEET-2 kii pariksha de sakate hai
 However, the Supreme Court has refused to allow states to conduct medical admission entrance examinations in separate regional languages
 rajyon kii ore se daleel di gai thi ki unhen apni pariksha lene kii anumati di jaae
 The court said that when the examination is being taken by the central government, there is no point in conducting a separate examination
 court ne ye bhi saaf kar diya he kiembibies yaa bidieski padhai ke liye kisi nijee college yaa association yaa kisi nijee, dimd vishvavidhyalay ko koi pariksha lene kii anumati nahin di jaaegi
 Why NEET case came up in Supreme Court, in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, besides many other states, seeking change in decision to take exam under NEET for MBBS and BDS in government medical colleges a petition was filed
 supreme court main kai rajyon kii ore se daayar yachikaaon main kaha gaya he ki un par NEET thopa nahin ja saktaa, kyonki unke yahaan par pehle se tay pariksha niti sirfmedical corsonmen hi daakhile ke liye nahin he, balki kai anya corson ke liye bhi lee jaati he, jo medical se sambandhit hai

 Union Agriculture Minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Sunday created controversy by making a statement that voters can 'vote twice' to take advantage of the multi-stage Lok Sabha elections in Maharashtra
 haalanki, baad main pavaar ne yah kehete hue apane is bayaan se pallaa jhaadne kii koshish kii ki unhone 'halke-phulke andaaj' main vah baat kahi thi
 But the Election Commission has announced an inquiry into this
 gauratlab he ki navi mumbai main 'mathdi' kamgaaron ke sammelan ke dauraan pavaar ne ensipi kaaryakartaaon se kaha ki ve 'do baar matdaan' karke maharashtra main kai charan main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav kaa phayda uthaaen
 He asked voters to vote first in their home district and then vote at the place where they work
 pashchim maharashtra ke satara jile ke kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue pavaar ne kaha, 'saal 2009 main satara or mumbai main ek hi din matdaan hua tha or log apane grih nagar chale gaye the
 But this time Satara is to be voted on April 17 while on April 24
 ' unhone kaha, 'satara main ensipi ke chihn 'taala' ke liye matdaan karen or yahaan bhi 'taala' par matdaan ke liye aa jaaen
 Workers lashed out at Pawar's statement
 baharhaal, baad main patrakaron se baatcheet main pavaar ne kaha ki unhone 'halke-phulke' andaaj main bayaan diya tha or isamen 'thodaa kataaksh' tha
 In the suburban Bhandup, Pawar said, 'party workers get bored with the same type of election speeches
 maine din main jo bayaan diya tha vah halke phulke andaaj main diya gaya tha
 He said, 'my statement should not be misinterpreted
 bogus matdaan hamaare rajya main nahin hota
 Pawar asked the party leaders to give a thoughtful statement
 desh, duniya, mahanagar, khel, aarthik or bollywood main kya kuch hua

 Amid a reduction in petrol prices by nearly Rs 2
5 per liter on Thursday night, Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee, a UPA ally, said that keeping in mind the presidential elections, petrol prices have been reduced and will be increased later

 uttar pradesh kii 80 loksabhaa siten 2014 ke aam chunaav main bhartiya janata party kii kismat ke lihaaj se behad ahm hai
 Narendra Modi's presence is going to have a major impact in the state, as the bjp's prime ministerial candidate has had an all-round political appeal on the basis of his strong performance on three criteria of ideology, character and credibility
 modi ke vaicharik jhukaav ke prati koi bhram nahin he
 Nobody doubts his personal honesty, and in this era of scams, this gap emerges more clearly
 gujarat main samarth prashaasak ke rup main vishwasaneey chhavi ke dam par ve apane sabhi pratidwandviyon se kahin zyada vishwasaneey maane jate hai
 His strong opponents will also have to admit that Modi has brought the issue of good governance and development to the center of Indian politics, so he has emerged as a symbol of the hope and aspiration for which the people of Uttar Pradesh are desperate
 is janata ko samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party ke bharose rahanaa padaa he, jinka netritv in teenon kasautiyon par kahin kamjor sabit hua he
 Whenever the voters of Uttar Pradesh have seen any ray of hope, their aspirations have risen above the thinking of caste and community to form a clear mandate
 pehle charan main jis tarah se log vot dene nikle, usase yah sanket saaf dikhaai de rahaa he
 Ten constituencies in western Uttar Pradesh, including riot victims Muzaffarnagar, saw more than 60 per cent turnout
 2009 ke aam chunaav main lagbhag 51 fisadi vot pade the, jabaki 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main jab samaajawaadee party ne ummid dilaai to vot pratishat 62 ke aasapaas pahunch gaya tha
 Even today the situation is same in the whole state
 modi ko rajya or desh ke liye sankatmochan mana ja rahaa he
 This is why the turnout was 10 per cent higher than in 2009
 matdaan main 5 fisadi se zyada badhotaree ke peeche aam taur par lahar dikhaai detii he
 This will be Modi's wave above caste equations in Uttar Pradesh
 donon hi chunaavon main jeetne vaali partiyon ne kul matdaan main se ausatan 33-35 fisadi vot hasil kiye
 In 2012, Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party won 224 out of 423 assembly seats
 chunaav ke dauraan aisa mana gaya ki musalmaan or yadav mul rup se samaajawaadee party ke samarthak hai
 But if these two are found, even then they can win only 92 seats
 phir samaajawaadee party kii baaki siten kahaan se ain? jaahir he ki duusari kai jatiyon ne bhi use vot diya hoga
 but why? Because at that time the voter in Akhilesh showed hope and aspiration, due to which the traditional caste equations of the state proved to be meaningless
 isamen koi nai baat nahin thi
 Earlier, Bahujan Samaj Party won 206 seats in the 2007 assembly elections
 tab aisa mana gaya ki mayawati ne daliton or kuch brahmanon ke dam par jeet hasil kii he
 These two communities account for more than 33 per cent of the voters in 110-115 seats in the state
 phir bahujan samaaj party ko baaki siten kahaan se milin?2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress ne 21 siten jeetin, jisaki vajah kisi jaateey sameekaran se samaj main nahin aati
 When the Congress entered the election, it did not have the support of any original caste vote bank
 uski bajaay manaregaa or upie-1 ke samaaj kalyaan se jude duusare kaaryakramon ne sushasan kii ummid jagaai thi
 With this good performance, there was talk of revival of the party in Uttar Pradesh
 phir 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress kaa safaya ho gaya, to vah vot bank kahaan gaayab ho gaya? congress tab sushasan kaa bharosa dilaane main asamarth thi, isliye jati kaa bhed bhuulakar voter ne uskaa saath chhod diya
 If seen only through the cluttered spectacles of caste politics, then the series which began with the victory of Bahujan Samaj Party in 2007 seems complicated
 lekin agar ise pichley saat saal main uttar pradesh main shashan se sanchalit raajnneeti ke sandarbh main dekha jaae, to baat saaf ho jaati he
 i call it the principle of convergence
 aaj har jati or samudaay ke voter ke liye sushasan sabase ahm mudda he
 Whoever fires their hopes and wishes will reap the crop in elections
 is chunaav main bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke pratyaashee uttar pradesh kii janata ke liye ummid or aakanksha ke pratik ban gaye hai
 The state is lagging behind most of the development criteria compared to Gujarat
 sushasan ke maamle main samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party, donon se uttar pradesh ke matadaata kaa moh bhang modi kii apil ko majboot kar rahaa he
 As far as the Congress is concerned, the poor performance of the UPA has left it out of the game
 iskaa sanket ham 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main dekh chuke hai
 In such a situation, by making Modi the prime ministerial candidate, the BJP has set the ideal ground for unifying the votes
 puri sambhaavna he ki rajya jatigat samikarnon se upar uthakar matdaan karegaa
 Modi has further increased the bjp's prospects by deciding to contest from a major constituency of the state like Varanasi
 isliye bijepi ne agar un ilaakon main paith bana lee, jahaan uske kadam pehle majboot nahin the, to koi hairaani nahin hogi
 It will be clear from this that the voters of Uttar Pradesh have made politics such a head rule that in the election, the decision will be based on good governance rather than caste
 (sudhanshu mittal bijepi ke varisht netaa hai) The Income Tax Department has taken action against Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath's nephew Ratul Puri and seized his bungalow worth Rs 300 crore in Delhi

 Ratul Puri has been accused by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) of money laundering in the agustawestland VVIP helicopter deal case
 idi ne court ke saamne tarq diya tha ki ‚Äúratul puri ko giraftaar nahin kiya gaya to vah videsh bhaag sakate hai
 He may flee abroad via Nepal or otherwise
 ‚Äù idi ne court main yah bhi tark diya ki ratul puri agasta westland ghotaale se jude subooton se bhi chhedchhad kar sakate hai
 Ratul Puri has been missing since March 27
 unhone vaqeel ke jariye court se agrim zamaanat kii maang kii thi jise mangalvaar ko kaarij kiya ja chukaa he
 The anticipatory bail plea of kamal Nath's nephew Ratul Puri has been rejected by the court that last month, the ED office of the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Kamal Nath's nephew Ratul Puri reached the MTNL building on Jawaharlal Nehru Marg in Delhi for questioning
 unhen idi ne viviipi helicopter ghotaale main poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa tha
 He was interrogated for a while but in the meantime he feared that the ED team would arrest him
 ratul ne idi daftar main jaanch adhikari se toilet jane kii baat kahi
 He went to the toilet and then disappeared from there
 jab kaaphi der tak jaanch adhikari ke paas ratul nahin pahunche to idi kii team ne bathroom or idi daftar main unhen har jagah khoja lekin ve kahin nahin mili
 Then the ED team reached Ratul's Delhi home and office but they could not be found there either
 idi daftar se shuru hua yah hivoltage drama yaheen khatm nahin hua
 The ED team was searching for Ratul that news of Ratul's disappearance started in the media the next morning
 uske baad idi offis se safai ai ki ratul ke bhaagane kii baat galat he
 Ratul came to the ED office for questioning
 He went to the toilet and disappeared from there without being told
 unako dobaaraa poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa jayega
 Shortly after this statement, Ratul Puri applied for his anticipatory bail in Rouse Avenue Court in Delhi
 ratul kii taraf se court main do jane maane vakil abhishek manu singhvi or vijay agarwal pesh hue
 He said Ratul Puri has appeared before the ED 22 times so far
 unako 23veen baar bulaayaa gaya tha
 He was supposed to go on a trip, but still appeared before the ED
 unhen giraftaar kaa andeshaa hua
 They went out to have lunch, but were told by ED that they fled
 congress ne saansat main fanse apane saansad or rashtramandal khelon kii aayojan samiti ke adhyaksh suresh kalmadi se khud ko alag kar liya or kaha ki party ‚Äòkanoonee prakriya main dakhlandaji nahin karegi
 Significantly, the CBI has raided the premises of Kalmadi

 When asked how the CBI raids would affect the Congress in Pune, Dwivedi said that the Congress as a political party would not comment on the legal procedures in the case
 kalmadi pune loksabhaa seat kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Regarding the controversial remarks of Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Ashok Singhal about Congress President Sonia Gandhi, the party spokesperson said that our response is the same as we did to RSS leader Sudarshan: About Rajiv Gandhi: At the time of comment Thi and whom: Sudarshan's comment: was later withdrawn

 ab faisla hua he ki pariksha ke baad 400 rupee waapas kar die jaaenge
 250 rupees will also be returned to reserved category students
 jab aap iees ke imtahaan kaa farm 100 rupee main bhar rahe hai to railway ke group di kii pariksha kaa farm 500 rupee main kyon bharenge, baharhaal railway ko yah baat samaj aa gai he
 This is a perfect example of how serious our institutions are about exams

 There is a way to change it, it should be announced two years ago

 Not only this, other Indian languages were excluded which has now been restored
 to aapane dekha ki bahaali nikaalane kaa shrey lene main railway mahakama itnaa mashruf ho gaya use pariksha kii teen teen sharton ko bich raste main badalane ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 Still see what has been decided about the fees

 In the 2017 budget session, the Minister of State for Personnel had told the Lok Sabha that the direct recruitment of the central government in 2015 was 89% lower than in 2013
 ab in donon aankadon ko padhein
 The exact picture is not known
 chaatr kehete hai ki railway ne in chaar varshon main bhartee bahut kam nikaali
 But in the minister's figure, the number of posts in SSC, Railways and UPSC decreased by only 12500
 yahi nahin, esayssi kii pariksha paas kar kareeb 20,000 chaatr apointment letters kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 Found in some departments but still waiting for call from many departments
 kisi vibhaag se chitthee mil rahi he kisi se nahin

 What about many students who are waiting for the joining letter by taking exams
 us par sarkaar kaa kya kamitment he
 Students want to know this
 adalati chakkar main atake hone kaa bahaanaa bahut vaazib nahin lagata
 The government and the selection commission may request the courts to demand a quick verdict so that the lives of the students are not ruined
 jis rajya main 70 hazaar se adhik pad court main atake hon vahaan haahaakaar much janaa chahie
 This shows how bad the court is
 nishchit rup se jajon kii sankhya kam hogi

 In the 2017 budget session, the Minister of State for Personnel had told the Lok Sabha that the direct recruitment of the central government in 2015 was 89% lower than in 2013
 ab in donon aankadon ko padhein
 The exact picture is not known
 chaatr kehete hai ki railway ne in chaar varshon main bhartee bahut kam nikaali
 But in the minister's figure, the number of posts in SSC, Railways and UPSC decreased by only 12500
 yahi nahin, esayssi kii pariksha paas kar kareeb 20,000 chaatr apointment letters kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 Found in some departments but still waiting for call from many departments
 kisi vibhaag se chitthee mil rahi he kisi se nahin
 Our series has had a fair impact on the postal department
 upi ke chaatro ne bataaya ki postal vibhaag ne 500 se adhik chaatro ko letters dena shuru kar diya he
 They will soon be joining Lucknow and Gonda divisions
 ham sabane inase guzarish kii he ki kabhi hindu muslim na karen
 The project should be closed within four months

 Students of Maharashtra Circle selected for Postal Department are also waiting for such good news
 unhen is tarah kii koi soochna nahi di ja rahi he ki chitthee kab milegi
 The same is true of students who have passed the film division
 agar hamaari series se 500 chaatro ke jivan par asar padataa he to ham maare khushi ke ise may tak karne kii soch rahe hai
 Previously thought till February, now we will do till May

 They are raising their voice from place to place
 rajasthan main chayan ayog kii susti or laaparvaahee ke kilaaf putala dahan se lekar pakora talan kaarykram kiye ja rahe hai
 The record of Rajasthan Public Service Commission is also very bad like the selection commission of other states
 berojgaar chaatr hamaari sahyogi harsha kumari singh se bhi milane aae
 She was shocked when she told her grief and saw it
 bahut se chaatr enditivi dilli ke daftar ke baahar bhi jamaa hone lag ja rahe hai
 If you can get an appointment letter from prime time, then come

 How are unemployed students performing
 inke naare main pakora ghus gaya he magar shantipurna tareeke se hone vaale in pradarshnon ko koi gambhirtha se kyon nahin le rahaa he
 Have the leaders become so confident of Hindu Muslim topics that these young men will leave their jobs and turn away again

 The Panchayati Raj Minister is falling at the feet of Rajendra Rathore so that the Minister wakes up

 This march of naked body youth is of Ajmer which came out during the by-election
 ye tritiy shrenee shikshak bhartee ko lekar march nikaal rahe the
 Unemployment has made the movement very creative, but the governments that are there have no effect
 harsha kii jaankaree ke mutabik rajasthan main do lakh 44 hazaar pad khaali hai
 The government promises that 95,667 jobs will be provided by the end of this year
 is vaade ke anusaar bhi sava lakh pad khaali rah jate hai
 What about many students who are waiting for the joining letter by taking exams
 us par sarkaar kaa kya kamitment he
 Students want to know this
 adalati chakkar main atake hone kaa bahaanaa bahut vaazib nahin lagata
 The government and the selection commission may request the courts to demand a quick verdict so that the lives of the students are not ruined
 jis rajya main 70 hazaar se adhik pad court main atake hon vahaan haahaakaar much janaa chahie
 This shows how bad the court is
 nishchit rup se jajon kii sankhya kam hogi
 Number of cases more
 isi kaa nateeja janata bhugat rahi he
 Will the Rajasthan government answer that in 2016, the Police Inspector's forms were filled, why the examination has not been done yet
 harsha kii jaankaree chaunkaane vaali he
 428 crores have been returned to the exchequer as a fee for several examinations
 berojgaaron kii jeb se kya shandaar kamai he
 Do not give jobs, earn 428 crores from them
 tippaniyan This letter may be the result of our job series
 hamane anthve ank main dikhaaya tha ki rajasthan main data entry operator kaa imtahaan june july 2017 main paas kar chaatr jwining letters kaa intazaar kar rahe the
 When we showed up in the job series, now we have started getting appointment letters
 kaayade se sarkaar ko is ek saal kaa bhi vetan dena chahie
 999 data entry operators have started getting the letter
 aap sab ko badhai
 The Hindus will keep their pledge not to do so
 dahej mat lijiega
 After our job series, students say that joining letter started getting
 naukari series ke tahat jo data sangrah ho rahaa he naujavaanon ko maansik yatnaa dene kaa use lekar koi bhi acha shodh prabandh likh saktaa he
 Letters of assistant engineers of Uttar Pradesh have been received
 inhone pariksha paas kii, naukari jwine kii magar sab barkhaast ho gaye
 The court said that they should be restored but they are not being restored yet
 aakhir kya vajah he ki har rajya main aisa ho rahaa he
 This picture is of that spectacle which starts with the examination of every staff selection commission
 bhopal ke keenpi kalege of science and technolji main 21 farvari kii subah 10
 The examination was to begin at 30
 sava baarah baje bataaya jaataa he ki paper radd ho gaya he or nayaa prashn patr diya jayega
 12
 30 baje se dobaaraa pariksha shuru ho jaati he
 The rest of the students start taking the exam again but some students opposed it
 ab 12 bajkar 50 minute par bataaya jaataa he ki pariksha phir se radd ho gai
 That is, the exam was canceled twice within two to two and a half hours and started twice
 magar pariksha centre staff salection kamishan ko yah likh kar detaa he ki chaatro ne hi esayssi sijiel 2017 tear tu kii pariksha kaa bahishkaar kiya he
 Now when the students get to know this, they start committing a ruckus at the examination center
 chaatr pariksha centre par jam jate hai
 Then the police arrive
 ab baatcheet kii nautanki shuru hoti he
 Students stayed there till 9 o'clock in the night
 centre ne likhit rup se diya ki esayssi ko puri ghatana kii jaankaree di jaaegi tab jaakar chaatr vahaan se hate
 It is not known when the exam will be held again
 lekin ye haal he hamaari pariksha vyavastha kaa
 Staff Selection Commission is taking the Tier Two exam
 yah pariksha 17 farvari se lekar 22 farvari tak honi he
 The SSC has stated in its clarification that the service provider informed the Commission that due to technical problem the data is not being downloaded in some places
 isliye phir se data downlod kii prakriya shuru kerani padi, isse hui deree ke kaaran desh bhar main vibhinn pariksha sthalon par 12
 The exam started at 10 pm
 or do ghante main yani 2
 Successfully completed at 10, 41,331 candidates had to take the exam, 80 percent appeared
 keval keenpi kalege of sains and technolji bhopal or sibar city online igjaminesh centre patna main candidit ne paper 1 kii pariksha nahin di
 What is the difference between students' claims and SSC cleanliness
 navabharat times ke narendra nath kii ek janvari kii ek report he
 The Minister of State for Personnel in the Rajya Sabha has given a written reply that between 2016-17 the posts filled by SSC i
e
 Staff Selection Commission, Union Public Service Commission and Railway Recruitment Board decreased by 12500 as compared to 2014-15
 2017 ke bajet satr main carmik rajya mantri ne loksabhaa main bataaya tha ki 2015 main centre sarkaar kii sidhi bhartiyon 2013 ke mukaable 89 fisadi kam thim
 Now read both these figures
 sahi tasviir kaa andaaza nahin miltaa he
 Students say that the railways pulled out very little in these four years
 magar mantri ji ke aankade main esayssi, railway or upiessi main padon kii sankhya main maatr 12500 kii kami ai
 Not only this, around 20,000 students are waiting for appointment letter after passing SSC exam
 kuch vibhaagon main mila he magar abhi bhi bahut se vibhaagon se bulaave kaa intazaar ho rahaa he
 a letter is being received from some department and not from anyone
 postal vibhaag par hamaari series kaa thik thaak asar padaa he
 UP students said that the postal department has started giving letters to more than 500 students
 lakhanu or gonda division main jaldi hi inaki jwining hone vaali he
 We have all requested him to never do Hindu Muslims
 is project ko chaar maheene ke andar band kara dena
 With this politics of hate and debates on TV, you can become a youth rioter, not an engineer or a doctor
 postal vibhaag ke liye chune gaye maharashtra cirkil ke chaatro ko bhi aisi khushkhabari kaa intazaar he
 They are not being given any information as to when they will receive the letter
 yahi haal film division main paas hone vaale chaatro kaa bhi he
 If our series affects the lives of 500 students, then we are thinking of doing it by May of happiness
 pehle farvari tak hi sochaa tha ab may tak karenge
 Ever since we have done this series, students have also become aware
 ve jagah jagah awaz uthaa rahe hai
 In Rajasthan, the effigy burning and pakoda frying programs are being done against the sluggishness and negligence of the selection commission
 rajasthan public sarvice kamishan kaa bhi ricard bahut kharaab he baaki rajyon ke chayan ayog kii tarah
 Unemployed students also came to meet our colleague Harsha Kumari Singh
 apni vyathaa bataai or dekha to ve bhi chaunk gayi
 Many students are also getting deposited outside NDTV Delhi office
 agar aapako prime time se apointment letters mil saktaa he to aa jaaiye
 Apart from this, you see these pictures which have come from Rajasthan
 berojgaar chaatr kis tarah pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Pakoda has entered their slogan, but why is no one taking these protests in a peaceful manner seriously
 kya netaaon ko hindu muslim taapic par itnaa bharosa ho gaya he ki ye noujvaan naukari chhodkar phir bahak jaaenge
 In this video, the girls are starting to fall on the minister's feet
 panchayat raaj mantri rajendra rathod ke charnon main gir rahi hai taaki mantri ji jaage
 They demand that the pending recruitments of Panchayati Raj be filled
 nange badan naujavaanon kaa yah march ajmer kaa he jo upachunaav ke vakt niklaa tha
 They were organizing a march to recruit third grade teachers
 berojgaare ne andolan ko kitna rachanaatmak bana diya he, magar jo sarkarein hai un par koi asar nahin padataa he
 According to the information of Harsha, two lakh 44 thousand posts are vacant in Rajasthan
 sarkaar kaa vaada he ki is saal ke ant tak 95,667 naukariyaan di jaaengi
 According to this promise, 1
25 million posts remain vacant
 bahut se chaatr jo pariksha lekar jwining letters kaa intazaar kar rahe hai unka kya
 What is the commitment of the government on that? chaatr ye jaananaa chaahate hai
 The excuse of being stuck in a court affair does not seem very reasonable
 sarkaar or chayan ayog chaahe to adaalaton se guzarish kar jaldi faisle kii maang kar sakate hai taaki chaatro kaa jivan barbaad na ho
 There should be chaos in the state where more than 70 thousand posts are stuck in the court
 yah bataata he ki court kii haalat kitni kharaab he
 Certainly the number of judges will be less
 cese kii sankhya zyada
 The public is suffering as a result of this
 kya rajasthan sarkaar is baat kaa jawaab degi ki 2016 main police inspector ke farm bhare gaye the, abhi tak pariksha kyon nahin hui he
 Harsha's information is shocking
 kai sari parikshaon ke shulk ke rup main sarkaar ke khajaane main 428 karod waapas aa gaye hai
 What a great earning from the pockets of the unemployed
 naukari na do, unase 428 karod kama lo
 The comments yah chitthee hamaari naukari series kaa parinaam ho sakati he
 We had shown in the ninth issue that the students were waiting for joining letter after passing the examination of data entry operator in Rajasthan in june-july 2017
 jab hamane naukari series main dikhaaya to ab jaakar apointment letters milane shuru ho hue hai
 As a rule, the government should also pay this one year
 999 data entry operator ko letters milanaa shuru ho gaya he
 Congratulations to all of you
 hindu muslin na karne ke apane pran par kaayam rahiega
 Do not take dowry
 hamaari naukari series ke baad chaatro kaa kahana he ki jwining letters milanaa shuru ho gaya
 Anyone can write a good dissertation about the mental torture of the young people who are collecting data under the job series
 uttar pradesh ke sahaayak abhiyantaaon ke patr mili hai
 He passed the examination, joined the job but all got dismissed
 adaalat ne kaha ki inhen behaal kiya jaae magar abhi tak inaki bahaali nahin ho rahi he
 After all, what is the reason that this is happening in every state
 karmchaaree chayan ayog tear tu kii pariksha le rahaa he
 This examination is to be held from 17 February to 22 February
 esayssi ne apni safai main kaha he ki sarvice pradaata ne kamishan ko soochna di ki takneekee samasya ke kaaran kuch jagahon par data downlod nahin ho paa rahaa he
 So the process of data download had to be started again, due to the delay in 12 different examination sites across the country
 10 par pariksha shuru ho saki
 And in two hours i
e
 2
 10 par safaltaapurvak puri hui, 41,331 parikshaarthiyon ko pariksha deni thi, 80 pratishat haazir hue
 Only in KNP College of Science and Technology Bhopal and Cyber city Online Examination Center Patna did the candidates not take the paper 1 exam

 999 data entry operator ko letters milanaa shuru ho gaya he
 Congratulations to all of you
 hindu muslin na karne ke apane pran par kaayam rahiega
 Do not take dowry
 hamaari naukari series ke baad chaatro kaa kahana he ki jwining letters milanaa shuru ho gaya
 Anyone can write a good dissertation about the mental torture of the young people who are collecting data under the job series
 uttar pradesh ke sahaayak abhiyantaaon ke patr mili hai
 He passed the examination, joined the job but all got dismissed
 adaalat ne kaha ki inhen behaal kiya jaae magar abhi tak inaki bahaali nahin ho rahi he
 After all, what is the reason that this is happening in every state
 postal vibhaag ke liye chune gaye maharashtra cirkil ke chaatro ko bhi aisi khushkhabari kaa intazaar he
 They are not being given any information as to when they will receive the letter
 yahi haal film division main paas hone vaale chaatro kaa bhi he
 If our series affects the lives of 500 students, then we are thinking of doing it by May of happiness
 pehle farvari tak hi sochaa tha ab may tak karenge
 Ever since we have done this series, students have also become aware
 ve jagah jagah awaz uthaa rahe hai
 In Rajasthan, the effigy burning and pakoda frying programs are being done against the sluggishness and negligence of the selection commission
 rajasthan public sarvice kamishan kaa bhi ricard bahut kharaab he baaki rajyon ke chayan ayog kii tarah
 Unemployed students also came to meet our colleague Harsha Kumari Singh
 apni vyathaa bataai or dekha to ve bhi chaunk gayi
 Many students are also getting deposited outside NDTV Delhi office
 agar aapako prime time se apointment letters mil saktaa he to aa jaaiye
 Apart from this, you see these pictures which have come from Rajasthan
 berojgaar chaatr kis tarah pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Pakoda has entered their slogan, but why is no one taking these protests in a peaceful manner seriously
 kya netaaon ko hindu muslim taapic par itnaa bharosa ho gaya he ki ye noujvaan naukari chhodkar phir bahak jaaenge
 In this video, the girls are starting to fall on the minister's feet
 panchayat raaj mantri rajendra rathod ke charnon main gir rahi hai taaki mantri ji jaage
 They demand that the pending recruitments of Panchayati Raj be filled
 nange badan naujavaanon kaa yah march ajmer kaa he jo upachunaav ke vakt niklaa tha
 They were organizing a march to recruit third grade teachers
 berojgaare ne andolan ko kitna rachanaatmak bana diya he, magar jo sarkarein hai un par koi asar nahin padataa he
 According to the information of Harsha, two lakh 44 thousand posts are vacant in Rajasthan
 sarkaar kaa vaada he ki is saal ke ant tak 95,667 naukariyaan di jaaengi
 According to this promise, 1
25 million posts remain vacant
 bahut se chaatr jo pariksha lekar jwining letters kaa intazaar kar rahe hai unka kya
 What is the commitment of the government on that? chaatr ye jaananaa chaahate hai
 The excuse of being stuck in a court affair does not seem very reasonable
 sarkaar or chayan ayog chaahe to adaalaton se guzarish kar jaldi faisle kii maang kar sakate hai taaki chaatro kaa jivan barbaad na ho
 There should be chaos in the state where more than 70 thousand posts are stuck in the court
 yah bataata he ki court kii haalat kitni kharaab he
 Certainly the number of judges will be less
 cese kii sankhya zyada
 The public is suffering as a result of this
 kya rajasthan sarkaar is baat kaa jawaab degi ki 2016 main police inspector ke farm bhare gaye the, abhi tak pariksha kyon nahin hui he
 Harsha's information is shocking
 kai sari parikshaon ke shulk ke rup main sarkaar ke khajaane main 428 karod waapas aa gaye hai
 What a great earning from the pockets of the unemployed
 naukari na do, unase 428 karod kama lo
 The comments yah chitthee hamaari naukari series kaa parinaam ho sakati he

 After all, what is the reason that this is happening in every state
 rajasthan main chayan ayog kii susti or laaparvaahee ke kilaaf putala dahan se lekar pakora talan kaarykram kiye ja rahe hai
 The record of Rajasthan Public Service Commission is also very bad like the selection commission of other states
 berojgaar chaatr hamaari sahyogi harsha kumari singh se bhi milane aae
 She was shocked when she told her grief and saw it
 bahut se chaatr enditivi dilli ke daftar ke baahar bhi jamaa hone lag ja rahe hai
 If you can get an appointment letter from prime time, then come
 iske alaava aap ye tasviren dekhie jo rajasthan se ain hai
 How are unemployed students performing
 inke naare main pakora ghus gaya he magar shantipurna tareeke se hone vaale in pradarshnon ko koi gambhirtha se kyon nahin le rahaa he
 Have the leaders become so confident of Hindu Muslim topics that these young men will leave their jobs and turn away again
 is video main ladkiyaan mantri ji ke paanv padane lagi hai
 The Panchayati Raj Minister is falling at the feet of Rajendra Rathore so that the Minister wakes up
 inaki maang he ki panchayat raaj kii lambit bhartiyon bhari jaaen
 This march of naked body youth is of Ajmer which came out during the by-election
