 Such suicide attacks were carried out for the first time in France

 As soon as elections come in the country, politics starts in the name of Sardar Patel
 unke naam ko lekar bijepi or congress donon hi bade dal raajnneeti karne lagate hai, lekin jab sardaar ko lekar kuch karne kii baat aati he to donon hi peeche hatate najar aate hai
 For the last 33 years, there has been a demand for giving national status to Karamsad, the ancestral village of Sardar Patel
 2002 main jab narendra modigujratke mukhyamantri the, tab karamsad main jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue modi ne congress par hamalaa karte hue sardaar patel ke gaanv karamsad ko rashtriya darja nahin die jane ko anyaay qaraar diya tha
 The hunger strike has started in the village since Monday for national status
 pradhanmantri ban gaye modi lekin vaada ab bhi adhur xxrep 4 a j vahinarendra modirajya se nikalate hue centre main aa gaye or desh ke pradhanmantri ban gaye hai
 The villagers are angry at the fact that Sardar's village Karamsad has not yet been given national status even after the BJP and BJP have an absolute majority in Gujarat and the Center
 unka kahana he ki agar mahatma gandhi ke porbandar ko rashtriya darja diya ja saktaa he to sardaar ke karamsad gaanv ke aisa anyaay kyon kiya ja rahaa?maang ko lekar anshan shurukarmasadagaanv ko rashtriya darja die jane kii maang ko lekar yahaan ke teen logon ne somvaar se mrityuparyant anshan shuru kar diya he, jabaki gaanv ke anya log anshan par baith gaye hai
 Many local BJP officials were also present in the fast and also supported the movement
 vahiin mangalvaar ko karamsad band kaa elaan kiya gaya he
 Bipin Patel of Karamsad village said that if this village gets special national status, not only will the honor of the village increase but the honor of Patel will also increase
 agar porbandar ko rashtriya darja dekar sammaan diya ja saktaa he to karamsad ke saath kyon nahin, jitani vailu gandhiji kii he, utani hi sardaar patel kii bhi he
 He further said that our point is that when Narendra Modi himself is in power at the center today and his demand for national status to Karamsad was his own, but did not fulfill it himself
 har jan ko anshan kaa samarthanek anya gramin rakesh patel ne kaha ki karamsad gaanv main amrant upwas kaa aayojan kiya hua he jiskaa bas ek hi yahi uddeshy he
 For years, the demand has been that Karamsad be given national status
 Nilesh Patel says that this is Sardar Patel's village
 yah patel kii bhoomi he, kai saalon se is gaanv ko rashtriya darja die jane kii maang kii ja rahi he
 There was a demand on this issue at all levels, but no one paid attention to it
 karamsad ko rashtriya darja die jane kii maang ko lekar aaj se shuru hue anshan main har varg ke log shaamil hue
 Those involved in the fast say that the fast will continue till this village is given national status

 kya kabhi aapane suna he ki apana parivaar chalaane or bacchon ko acchhee shiksha dene ke liye ek maa apane hi bacchon ko bech de
 Probably not, but a mother in China did something similar
 ji haa, ek netraheen maa ne parivaar chalaane ke liye apane 4 bacchon ko bechney kii baat kabool kii he
 Between 2005 and 2012, a woman named Du Jiyong, who lives in China's Shihuan Province, sold her 3 newborn girls and a boy

 i am not selling them, but keeping them away from me
 badale main main sirf garbhvatee hone kii fees le rahi hum
 'he said,' i love children
 agar main sakasham hoti to main jarur khud unhen bada karti
 But i cannot support them, so i have to find good families for them who can adopt them
 'yah daawa karte hue ki usne kuch galat nahin kiya he dwayu ne kaha, 'main un pariwaron ko bachche de detii hum jo unhen paidaa nahin kar sakate
 They want children and i help them
 'vah kahati he, 'beti kii shaadi main amir paise kharch karte hai, middle class beti kii shaadi ke liye paise kamata he or garib aadmi betaa or beti bech detaa he

 bihar main rajd adhyaksh lalu yadav kii mushkilen khatm hone kaa naam nahin le raheen
 Lalu Yadav may have been demanding the resignation of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi in the creation scam, but Sushil Modi, on the contrary, continues his series of allegations against him with evidence on his close connection to the state's sand mafia
 shuukravaar ko susheel modi ne bijepi daftar main yojit sanvadata sammelan main aarope lagaaya ki rajya ke ek baaluu mafia arun yadav ne rabadi devi ke marachhiya devi apartment main ek hi din main paanch flats kaa registration karaayaa
 According to the papers released by Modi, on 13 June 2017, Arun Yadav registered five flats for two crore 53 lakh in the name of his sons Rajesh Kumar Ranjan, Dipu Kumar and Kiran Devi, who is his wife
 isse pehle modi ne hi aarope or saboot die the ki lalu yadav ke kareebi or in dinon police chhapemari ke kaaran faraar chal rahe subhash yadav ne 3 flats khride the
 Subhash and Arun both registered the flats on the same day i
e
 13 June
 susheel modi ke anusaar inakam tex unke apartment ke flats jabt na kar le isliye unhone aanan-fanan main ye registration karaayaa
 And for this, the purchase sale from the people close to you was dealt with quickly
 lekin rajd ke neton kaa kahana he ki isamen kuch bhi galat nahin hai or arun or subhash agar baaluu ke khanan main lage the tab sarkaar ne hi iske liye unka chayan kiya tha
 But experts believe that Arun and Subhash, taking advantage of their proximity to Lalu Yadav, continued to do illegal mining of their own accord, defying the law and doing all the work without the necessary permission
 lekin jab se satta parivartan hua tab se jis bihar police kii naak ke neeche unhone avaidh khanan ko mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar ke samay ek mukaam tak pahunchaaya, vahi ab unke peeche pad gai he
 The comments lekin jaankaar maanate hai ki jahaan susheel modi flats kii kharid bikri kii jaanch inakam tex se karne kii maang kar rahe hai vahiin wo baaluu ho yaa gitti, in donon chizon ke avaidh dhandhe kii puri jaanch sibiai se karne se kyon hichak rahe hai? ye baat kisi se chhipi nahin ki rajd ke netaa hon yaa bijepi yaa janata dal united, vampanthi dalon ko chhodkar is dhandhe main sabhi dalon ke aadhe darjan se netaa shaamil rahe hai
 And more than 100 police officers, whether they are sitting in the main office or officers or constables posted in the police station, everyone has got more than 1000 crores to the state exchequer every year
 or jab bihar police khud chori main shaamil ho tab usase usee jaanch main eemaandaaree or nishpakshta kii ummid karnaa bemaani hoga
 But it remains to be seen whether the Central Government, which is the special agency in this case, gives the CBI a probe by the state government or will formalize the investigation and raid with its police and will make the entire case go bust

 But ever since the change of power, the Bihar Police, under whose nose he led illegal mining to a position during the Grand Alliance government, has now fallen behind him
 tippaniyan But experts believe that while Sushil Modi is demanding to investigate the sale of the flat with income tax, why is he reluctant to conduct a thorough investigation by the CBI about the illegal business of both these things - sand or ballast? It is not hidden from anyone whether RJD leader or BJP or Janata Dal United, except the Left parties, half a dozen leaders of all parties have been involved in this business
 or kareeb 100 se adhik police adhikari, wo chaahe mukhyalay main baithne vaale hon yaa thana main padasthapit adhikari yaa sipaahi, sabaki mili bhagat se hi rajya main har saal sarkari khajaane ko 1000 karod se adhik kii chapat lagaayi jaati rahi he
 And when the Bihar Police itself is involved in the theft, it would be meaningless to expect honesty and fairness in that investigation

 puraani kahawat he ki chor ko maare khaansee, pahalwaan ko maare basi, or baba ko maare daasi
 This is what happened with Baba Ram Rahim
 deraa aane ke baad shuruaati dinon main haniprit baba kii ek aam daasi jaisi hi thi
 But on seeing it again, the maid became special and then completely special
 itani ki baba ne munhaboli beti kaa puraa matlab hi badal kar rakh diya
 Honeypreet's ex-husband Vishwas Gupta has uncovered the secrets of Baba's black misdeeds, but now another eyewitness of this whole affair has come to the fore, who is the witness of the night when Honey Baba went to Baba's cave for the first time after marriage
 gurdas singh ram rahim ke driver rahe khatta singh ke bete or haniprit or ram rahim ke rishton ke ek ahm chashmadid hai
 According to Gurdas, it was Ram Rahim, who had a bad look at Honeypreet for the first time
 usne haniprit kii shaadi karwaai or shaadi ke fouran baad ek raat usko apni gupha main bula liya
 Gurdas was on duty outside the cave that night with one of his cousins
 us rose use pehali baar shaq hua tha ki ram rahim haniprit ke saath galat karne ja rahaa he
 He also bet on this with his cousin and what happened the next morning proved his point to be true
 agali subah haniprit baba kii gufa se roti hui baahar nikali thi
 In those days, Honeypreet's grandfather used to be the treasurer of the camp
 haniprit sidhe dada ke paas gai
 Seeing this condition of Honeypreet, then her grandfather created a lot of ruckus in the camp and started speaking openly against Ram Rahim
 lekin unhen tab hathiyaaron ke dam par chup kara diya gaya
 Soon after this incident, Honeypreet left the camp and left for her home in Fatehabad
 lekin tab baba ke kuch gurgon ne haniprit kaa peechha kiya or hathiyaaron ke dam par use raste main hi ek dhabas se uthaa kar dere par waapas le aae
 It is said that this was the day when Honeypreet swore that she would destroy Baba and kill him
 gurdas ko ab lagata he ki ram rahim kii is tabaahi ke peeche shaayad haniprit kii wo kasam hi he
 Because it is Honeypreet, who got Ram Rahim to film, after taking the saint off, Ram Rahim became a designer Baba at the behest of Honeypreet and started doing everything which was contrary to the dignity of the saint
 vaisehaniprit beshak ram rahimaki tabaahi kii vajah bani ho, lekin sachai to ye he ki wo apni tabaahi kaa jimmedaar khud hi he
 Ram Rahim's footsteps were seduced from day one, despite sitting on the throne of the saint
 ram rahim blue filmon kaa shaukeen tha
 Separate cassettes were used for him and when a sadhvi opened in the camp, he started exploiting the girls of the camp through the same sadhvi and opened the school in the name of forgiveness and raped the girls

 Efforts are on a war footing to rescue 33 people trapped in the mine in the South American country of Chile
 inako bachaane ke liye surang banane kaa kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 As soon as tunneling machines arrived with the Chilean flag
 aashaa-niraashaa ke bich jhul rahe khadaan main fanse karmchaariyon ke gharavaalon main ummid kii nai roshni jagaai gai
 a strategy has been chalked out to construct 26 inch wide tunnel for evacuation of people
 beshak, is mashin ke aane se bachaav kaa kaam tej hone kii ummid he lekin bachaavkarmiyon kaa kahana he ki rescue oparation kii raah main abhi dheron rode hai
 The tunnel will be built for about half a mile, so the rescue team believes that this work will take several days
 yahaan tak ki maheene bhar kaa vakt lag saktaa he
 Adres Sogaret, who is leading the rescue team, says it may take three to four months to complete the rescue operation
 maut se yah jang behad lambii he
 Rescue workers have already said that the rescue operation can take up to four months
 yani, khadaan ke bheetar ek choti-si jagah main 33 logon ko puure chaar maheene tak khud ko bachaae rakhana hoga
 On 5 August, 33 workers from Chile landed in Garahai, about half a mile away, to extract gold and copper from the mine
 yah unka roj kaa kaam tha
 But, that day Honi had something else approved
 jaise hi ve 700 meter kii gaharaai main utre, ek bhayankar haadasa ho gaya
 The workers got trapped in the mine
 is haadase ke 21 din biit chuke hai
 With just one hole, 33 people are alive somehow
 lekin, maut se unki ladaai lambii he
 In fact, the specialty of Chilean mines is that the emergency shelters built in these are 20 to 40 feet wide and so high
 apaat sthiti ke liye yahaan khaane-pine kaa bhi intjaam hota he
 This is the reason workers are still safe
 lekin, apaat bhojan ke intjaam par bhala kab tak yah log jinda rah sakate hai, lihaaja ek suraakh ke jariye plastic kii tub main glucose tathaa anya taral padaarth bheja ja rahaa he
 So that the trapped people can get enough dose to stay alive
 khaane ke saath in logon ke liye oxigen capshul bhi bheja gaya he
 But, food is not enough to keep people alive
 iske liye paryaapt hawa bhi chahie
 Interaction with the outside world is also needed to maintain morale
 iske liye do or suraakh banaae ja rahe hai
 Dialogue will be arranged from one hole and air from another
 donon suraakh kaa kaam aakhri charan main pahunch chukaa he
 Aspirin and diabetes medicine have also been sent to the mine as workers also have diabetes and asthma patients
 bachaav kii in koshishon ke bich khadaan ke baahar bhaawanaaon kaa samandar bhi hiloren le rahaa he
 The mine housekeepers are also sending letters to them along with the food capsules
 andar se bhi kaamgaar iskaa jawaab bhej rahe hai
 When one of these letters was read by Chilean President Sebastian Pinera, the whole nation shone with hope
 khadaan ke andar se ai pehali chitthee main likhaa tha, din nikalataa ja rahaa he
 Some's father is locked in a mine and some one's husband
 kisi ke bhai kii jaan fansi he to kisi ke premi kii
 Every person waiting for a miracle is eagerly waiting for the rescue operation to end
 dakshini china main pichley saal ek khadaan se 25 din baad teen kamgaaron ko nikaala gaya tha
 More than a day later, there is no case of anyone being taken alive from inside the mine
 gauratlab he ki 2006 main tasmania main ek sone kii khadaan main fnse 16 kamgaaron ko 14 dinon baad jivit nikaala gaya tha
 In a very small place, these workers had to face very difficult conditions
 lekin, din ke lihaaj se itihaas kaa sabase bada khadaan haadasa hone ke baavjood yahaan ummiden jinda hai
 Actually, it is because Chile is the world's leading country in terms of copper and gold production
 is lihaaj se yahaan khadaanon ke liye behad aadhunik upkaran hai
 In such a situation, it is hoped that these people can be saved
 duusari ahm baat yah he ki sone or tambe ke khadaan kaa maamla koyala khadaanon se alag hota he
 There is a possibility of leakage of methane gas in the coal mine
 mithen gas vaataavaran main failkar vahaan se oxigen ko visthapit kar detii he
 There is also a risk of black dumps and carbon dioxide spread in coal mines
 lekin, tambe or sone kii khadaanon main aisi samasya nahin hoti
 Obviously, these things raise expectations
 chile ke 33 pariwaron ko is vakt ummid ke oxigen kii hi jarurat he
 This time the Central Board of Secondary Education can change the time table of board examinations
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki is baar walkational subject kii parikshaayen jald karwaai ja sakati he, jisase anya vishyon keeparikshasi samay par khatm ho sake
 This decision can be taken due to the academic examinations being done at the right time
 hindustan times ke anusaar, adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki acadmic parikshaon kaa aayojan march main hi kiya jayega or board jald hi chaatro ke liye nayaa time-teble jari kar degaa
 This will enable the candidates to prepare for their exam on the basis of that
 reports ke anusaar is baar 2
 8 million i
e
 around 28 lakh candidates have registered for CBSE 10th and 12th
 pichley saal kii parikshaayen 2018 main march main karwaai gai thi
 On the other hand, the vocational subject examinations will be done at school-based centers, while the examinations for other academic subjects will be at other examination centers
 bataaya ja rahaa he kisibiasainepatternase bhi pariksha kaa aayojan kar saktaa he
 The board has started the process of changes in the paper pattern of class 10th and 12th for 2020
 CBSE ko court kaa notice, is kaam ke liye vasuuli ja rahi moti feeskhabaren aa rahi hai ki nai pariksha pranali vidhyaarthiyon kii analitical skills jaanchegi
 The aim of this change is to end the practice of learning by rote among students
 yah students ke liye laabhadaayak ho saktaa he

 And with 9 balls remaining, the score reached 156 for three wickets, and gave the team victory

 america ke huston main ek subah main or meri patni ek restaraan se naashtaa karke nikal rahe the to meraa chaay pine kaa man kiya, kyonki maine thodaa spisi naashtaa kiya tha
 But i also knew that tea would not be available here
 chaay kii is hudak ke saath hi mere jehan main ek sawaal uthaa ki kya hamaare desh main mujhe kahin acchhee chaay milegi?"chyos ke founder nitin saluja bataate hai, ''main sochane laga ki dilli, mumbai yaa lakhanu main koi aisi jagah he jahaan ''meri vaali typya chaay mil sake?" unke jehan main ek hi sawaal baar-baar kaundh rahaa tha ki chaay jaisi kaaman cheez ke liye log aakhir ghar yaa phir kisi chaay kii dukaan par hi kyon nirbhar karte hai? mjedaar baat yah rahi ki sawaal ke saath-saath jawaab bhi unke bheetar se hi ubharne laga tha
 For example, is it not the case that due to lack of a common tea test, no one has noticed it yet? The series did not stop here, with these answers, the question arose again, is it easy to give "meri wali tea" to everyone? Is it that the image of tea is so cheap in our mind that someone has worked on it Did not understand the need to do that? That morning in Houston created many questions and answers within the founder of Chayos
 kul milakar nitin ke dimag main sawaalon or javaabon kaa bhandar-sa ikattha ho gaya
 If he found an answer, then a new question would arise from him
 par isi silsile ne unhen chyos kii kalpana karne ke liye prerit kiya
 In the midst of this confusion, the concept of "meri Wali Chai" started cooking in his mind
 ek ejeeniyar kaa jaisaa simple analitical mind set hota he, vaise hi unhone kaam karnaa shuru kiya
 Started research day and night, very soon they came to know that some people had tried to work on this concept
 lekin un logon kii shuruyaat thik nahin thi
 He did not research for a few months, but from February 2010 to February 2012 i
e
 two whole years
 prajentation banaae, excel shit taiyaar kii, kisi or ke liye nahin balki khud ke liye
 In Nitin's words, "looking at my own presentation, i said many times that no, there is something missing now
" yah vah plan nahin jo mere dil tak pahunche
 "he looked like a connoisseur customer in search of" meri wali tea "
 aakhirkaar do saal kii jaddojahad ke baad unhen laga ki ab is sapane ko saakaar karne kaa samay aa gaya he
 By May 2012, he was convinced that now he had to sell tea
 unhone ek america bahurashtriya company kii apni naukari chhodie kaa man bana liya
 But at the behest of a senior, he did not leave the job completely and part time till December
 november 2012 main unhone apana pehla store gudgaanv sibar city main kholaa
 Soon he realized that both Chaios and Job are not possible simultaneously
 lekin sab kuch itnaa aasaan bhi na tha
 In fact, when he decided to quit, his wife was pregnant
 unki pehali santan hone vaali thi
 Householders thought it would be a stupid move
 jaisaa ki ek middle class family main hota he, vaisaa hi hua
 Recalling the story of that time, he says, "I am a resident of Lucknow
 har koi mujhe bataane laga ki iity karnaa, phir acchhee job paakar naukari chhodkar bijness karnaa bevakoofi hogi
 And at a time when the wife is in a period of pregnancy, this decision is not good at all
 papa to is faisle se khaase apaset the
 "nitin's father also studied engineering
 unhone politechnic se ejineering kii thi
 However, he too did business after working for a few months in PWD
 ve aayran or steel kaa bijness karte hai
 He explains, "papa did engineering from the polytechnic and i did IIT
 isliye puure parivaar ke liye yah garv kii baat thi
 i am the first person in the family to reach IIT
 isliye bhi meraa naukari chhodkar bijness karnaa zyada khal rahaa tha
 However, after a lot of respect, gradually everyone agreed
 " haalanki nitin apni patni yosha kaa zikr karte hue kehete hai ki ve pehle din se saath thim
 Then both of his sisters also explained to Papa
 maa bhi saport main aa gayi
 Nitin does not forget to mention his friend and business partner Raghav Varma along the journey of Chaios
 ve kehete hai chyos ke sapane ko gadha karne kaa kaam raghav ne kiya
 Explaining the big hand of the mother behind the imagination of Nitin Chayos, he says, "the truth is that my mother has an important role in this concept
 " darasal unki maa ne aath saal kii umr main hi unhen chaay banani sikhaa di thi
 He would make tea whenever his friends came
 sabko unke haath kii chaay itani acchhee lagati ki ve nitin ke haath kii hi chaay kii demand karatin
 Just from there, it slowly got deep down inside him that "I make excellent tea
" "haalanki chyos ke concept se pehle bhi ve do or innovations ke bare main soch chuke the
 First West Management and Second Home Depot
 home depo yani ek aisa store jahaan aapako ghar banane kii har cheez mili
 From cement to sanitary ware, kitchen to garden items
 lekin jab unhone apane papa se in donon idiaj kaa zikr kiya to unhone inhen khaarij kar diya
 That is why he did not discus the idea of chaos
 nitin chyos kaa menu haath main lekar bataate hai ki log sabase zyada desi vaali chaay pasand karte hai
 Actually it is made according to the demand of every customer
 shakkar, chipatti, doodh kaa anupaat chaayoj ke har cap main vahi hota he jo customer ko chahie
 "you won't believe it, i believe 12,000 kinds of tea can be made in this way
" chaay ke saath hamane khaane main bhi prayog kiye
 Like Poha of MP, Ban Maske of Mumbai can only be imagined in Chayos
 " sakaaratmak urja se labarej nitin ek bada mjedaar kissa bataate hai
 When Chaos started, people would come and ask them, which foreign brand chain is this? The surprising thing is that in the country where tea is consumed from house to house, people did not think that any person from India can bring such idea here
 nitin bataate hai, ''logon ke is sawaal ne unhen puri tarah aashwast kar diya ki unhone ek aisi soch ko saakaar kar diya he jiskaa intjaar to logon ko tha, magar yah yakeen nahin tha ki use koi bhartiya saakaar kar saktaa he
 "what was it then? The journey started from a chaise and reached 53 stores
 gurugram ke galeria market main chyos ke store main baithkar chaay kii chuskee ke saath ve hansate hue kehete hai, ''kisi mahaan shaks ne kaha he na, ''ab chaay kaa samay aa gaya he
 " id ke mubarak maukey par bhi pakistan bharat ke khilaaf zehar ugalane se baj nahin aayaa
 As such, any festival gives a message of peace and brotherhood and it is expected that on such occasions people should forget their mutual pique and fight fights and thank God
 lekin yah baat shaayad aatank ko apni samskruti bana lene vaale pakistan par lagu nahin hoti
 On the occasion of eid-ul-azha, lashkar-e-taiba chief Hafiz Mohammed Saeed not only spewed venom against India, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and President Mamnoon Hussain also did not lag behind
 sabhi ne mungerilaal kii tarah kashmir kii azaadi ke sapane dekhe
 In his message, Nawaz Sharif said that we dedicate this Eid to the 'supreme sacrifice' of the Kashmiris and Pakistan will continue to do so until the Kashmir issue is resolved according to the Kashmiris
 unhone kaha ki kashmiriyon ko apane balidanon kaa fal milegaa
 Sharif, along with his family, offered prayers at the mosque in Rawalpindi and said that the Kashmiris had sacrificed their third generation in the struggle to gain independence from India
 unki aawaaj ko takat se nahin dabaaya ja saktaa
 On the other hand, Pakistan President Mamnoon Hussain said in his message on the occasion of Eid Mubarak that Pakistan will always remember its Kashmiri brothers and sisters affected by terrorism
 is samay kashmir ke logon ko hamaare saport kii zarurat he
 He said that soon the people of Kashmir will celebrate the festivals on free ground
 tippaniyan On the other hand, Hafiz Saeed, the chief of Lashkar and mastermind of the Mumbai attack, prayed for the success of the Kashmiri war against the Indian forces
 usne pakistan sarkaar se kashmir par kadaa rukh apnaane or aazaadee main kashmiriyon kii madad karne kaa aagrah kiya he
 The special thing is that Hafiz Saeed congratulated the leadership of Hurriyat and said that he deserves respect for bringing the people of Kashmir on one platform
 said ne aage kaha ki kashmir ke logon ne pehle hi azaadi hasil kar lee he
 Slaves are those who do not believe in Allah and celebrate Eid merely as a custom
 vah din dur nahin he jab kashmiri azaad ho jaaenge or jo gulam hai unke liye misaal pesh karenge
 Happy Eid to all those whose blood boils for Kashmir
 ab to yahi lagata he ki pakistan main aadhikarik taur par chune gaye pratinidhi or aatankwaadi donon kii baton main bharat ko lekar ferq behad kam hota ja rahaa he jo bharat ke liye hi nahin puri duniya ke liye chintaa kii baat he
 But this may not apply to Pakistan, which has made terror its culture
 id-ul-azaha ke maukey par lashkar-e-taiyyaba ke mukhiya hafiz mohammad said ne to bharat ke khilaaf zehar ugala hi, pakistan ke pradhanmantri nawaz shareef or raashtrapati mamoon hossain bhi isamen peeche nahin rahe
 Everyone, like Mungerilal, dreamed of independence of Kashmir
 apane sandesh main navaj sharif ne kaha ki ham is id ko kashmiriyon ke 'sarvocch balidaan' ke prati samarpit karte hai or pakistan aisa tab tak jari rakhega jab tak kashmir mudda kashmiriyon ke mutabik sulajh nahin jaataa
 He said that Kashmiris will get the fruits of their sacrifices
 sharif ne apane parivaar ke saath rawalpindi main masjid main namaaz padhi or kaha ki bharat se aazaadee paane ke sangharsh main kashmiriyon ne apni teesri peedi kaa balidaan de diya he
 His voice cannot be suppressed with strength
 vahiin pakistan ke raashtrapati mamoon hossain ne id ke mubarak maukey par apane sandesh main kaha ki pakistan aatankwaad se prabhavit apane kashmiri bhaaiyon or bahanon ko hameshaa yaad rakhega
 At this time, the people of Kashmir need our support
 unhone kaha ki jald hi kashmir ke log tyoharon ko aaazaad sarajameen par manaayenge
 The comments udhar lashkar ke chif or mumbai hamale ke mastermind hafiz said ne bhartiya phujon ke khilaaf kashmiriyon kii jang ke safal hone kii dua kii
 It has urged the government of Pakistan to take a tough stand on Kashmir and help Kashmiris in independence
 khaas baat yah he ki hafiz said ne hurriyat ke netritv ko badhai dete hue kaha ki wo kashmir kii janata ko ek manch par laane ke liye sammaan ke haqadaar hai
 Saeed further said that the people of Kashmir have already attained independence
 gulam to wo hai jo allaah main yaqiin nahin karte or mahaz rivaaj ke taur par id manaate hai

 Quint kii report ke mutabik, reporter himanshi choudhary ke khilaaf nihlani ne dhamkaane or niztaa ke hanan kaa aarope bhi lagaaya he
 What is sensor work? Aamir Khan explained, "what is Pahlaj Nihalani listening to? Nihalani has filed a complaint on Friday
" haalanki abhi yah saaf nahin he ki unhone 'jab harry met sejal' vaale ke vivaad ke liye shikaayat darj karwaai he yaa 'babumoshaay bandookbaaj' main 48 kats lagane jane vaale sawaalon ke liye
 Nihalani has written in the complaint lodged with the police - the reporter was constantly harassing me in my office building
 wo security gards or offis staff ko bhi pareshaan kar rahi thi
 Pahlaj Nihalani sent notice to IIFA, accusing Watchman of speaking but there is also a twist in this whole story
 darasal Mirror Now ke editor or reporter himanshi choudhary ne nihlani par aarope lagaate hue kaha he ki nihlani ne himanshi ko dhamkaaya or unka haath pakad kar daraane kii koshish bhi kii thi
 Speaking to Quint, the editor said - If a reporter is asking questions, then it would not be harassment
 yadi mistar nihlani ko lagata he ki reporter ke khilaaf cese darj karaane se ham dar jaaenge to bahut badi galati kar rahe hai
 Laughs at all these things
 ham jaldi hi puraa video relies karenge
 In fact, in the trailer of Jab Harry Met Sejal, Nihalani objected to the word Intercourse
 isi vishay par unhone Mirror Now ke dibet main hissaa liya tha
 There, while giving the challenge, he said that if the channel brings 1 lakh votes in support of this word, then they will pass the film without a cut
 jab channel 1 lakh vot jutaney main kaamyaab ho gaya tha to channel kii reporter ne lift main nihlani se is vishay par sawaal poocha tha
 But Nihalani did not respond to this

 abu azmi to mulaayam se bhi ek kadam aage nikle or kaha ki jo mahilaayein sahmati yaa bina sahmati ke sex karti hai unhen faansee par taang dena chahie
 In an interview given to a newspaper, Abu Azmi was asked what he wanted to say on Mulayam Singh's statement, his reply was, "rape is punishable in Islam
 lekin yahaan auraton ko kuch nahin hota jabaki mard ko sajaa milti he
 The woman is also guilty
 agar marji se koi sex karata he to koi dikkat nahin he
 At the same time, when there is a complaint, there is a problem
 haath lagaaya to shikaayat kar detii hai agar nahin lagaaya to bhi shikaayat kar detii hai
 Nowadays this matter has increased a lot
 or mard kii isse jindagi bhar kii izzat khatm ho jaati he
 Azmi said, "according to Islam, if we make any connection with the will, we should be hanged
" hindustan main rape ke liye faansee di jane lagi he
 If you are doing it freely then nothing happens
 lekin marji or bagaiyr marji ke bich main jindagi or maut kaa sawaal he
 If living with consent, nothing happens but if you get angry and complain, then you will get hanged
 ye maamla bahut sangeen he
 When Azmi was asked what is the solution to the incidents like rape, he replied- 'the solution is that if a girl is married or unmarried, she makes a relationship of her own free will or without will, then she should also be hanged
 needed
 ladkaa-ladki donon ko faansee honi chahie
 However, he made it clear that if someone is forcibly raped, only the boy should be hanged
 itnaa kuch bolne ke baad mulaayam ke bayaan par pratikriya dete hue azmi ne kaha, ‘wo kis sandarbh main bol rahe the ye mujhe pataa nahin lekin rape ke maamle main faansee honi hi chahie
 'it is worth mentioning that the Samajwadi Party chief and former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav while addressing a public meeting said that it is completely wrong to hang on rape in all cases
 ladakon se akasar galtiyaan ho jaati hai to aise par sidhe-sidhe faansee dena galat he

 Shani is a symbol of meaning, religion, action and justice
 shani hi dhan-sampatti, vaibhav or moksh bhi dete hai
 Shanidev is extremely annoying for sinful people
 shanidev kii krupa se aapaki jeb ke dhan kaa sidhaa sambandh hota he
 So if you always want to be rich or if you want to become rich person, then please Shani Dev
 aamtaur par log shanidev ko andhakaaramayi, bhavaheen, gussell, nirdayee or utsaahhin bhi maan baithte hai, lekin jyotishi kehete hai ki shanidev eemaandaar logon ko yash, dhan, pad or sammaan se navajte hai
 Let's know which people Shani Dev makes rich
 khaas kaamon se prasann honge shani-- jo log apane nakhun niyamit antaraal par katate hai
 Shani does not allow dirt to get accumulated in his nails, always welfare them
 - jo log pus maah main garibon ko kaale chane, kaale til yaa urad, kaale kapade daan karte hai shani unase prasann rahete hai
 - People who donate black umbrellas to avoid sunlight during the first month
 - shanidev un par apni chhatra chaaya banaae rakhte hai
 - Those who lead the way by visually impaired, Shani Dev opens the path of progress for them
 - jo log shanivaar kaa upwas rakhkar bhojan garibon ko daan karte hai, shani unke ghar ke bhandar bharte hai
 Shani Dev is always happy with those who feed on fish
 - jo log rose snaan kar swayan ko saafe or pavitra rakhte hai, shanidev unhen kabhi ksht nahin dete hai
 - Those who give respect and financial grant to the cleaning workers, Shanidev provides money to them
 - jo log mehanatakash mazdooron kaa haq nahin maarthe hai, shanidev unhen kabhi ksht nahin dete hai
 - Those who give equal respect to elderly women, Shani Dev is ready to help them
 - jo log pipal va bargad kaa niyamit pujan karte hai, shanidev unase jaldi prasann ho jate hai
 - Those who worship the Shivling regularly, Shani Dev always cares for them
 - jo log pitru shraadh kar coy ko bhojan dete hai, shanidev khush hokar unke ksht harte hai
 - Those who earn Lakshmi from the path of religion, Shani gives them the blessings of unbreakable Lakshmi
 - jo log asahaay vridhon ko aarthik anudaan dete hai, shanidev unke bhandar bhar dete hai
 This work annoys Shani - when people speak falsely or do fraud
 - jab log bujurg yaa mata-pita kaa apmaan karte hai
 - When someone takes away someone's right or insults weak people or women
 - jab vyakti laaparvaahee karata he
 - When the person does not wake up before sunrise and sleeps at sunset
 - jab vyakti hare vriksh katata he, to shani naaraaz ho jate hai
 Mantra of powerful Shani - Anyone can chant the mantras of Shani Dev
 - shani mantron kaa jaap purv-pashchim disha kii taraf munh karke karnaa chahie
 - Chant the mantra in the evening or midnight
 - rudraksh yaa rakt chandan kii maala par shani mantra kaa jaap karen
 - Recite your Guru, Lord Shiva or Shri Krishna before chanting the mantra
 - koi bhi grihasth vyakti kaale vastra dhaaran karke mantra jaap na karen
 - The Vedic mantra of Shani Dev is "om Shan Shanishrai Namah"

 mane-man modi ji chachaa nitish ji ko pataa nahin kya-kya kehete honge? maane puch rahe he? vaise kal donon saath rahenge? aashaa he DNA report kaa aadan-pradaan hoga

 com / 9rvr0g1erl The election rally in Bihar started with a blatant charge of Narendra Modi
 nitish kumaar ke DNA (modi ke anusaar raajnneetik) par sawaal uthaate hi bihari asmita par sawaal khadaa kar diya gaya tha
 Nitish Kumar said that this is an insult to Biharis
 nitish ne ek website banaakar narendra modi ko khulaa khat likhaa tha or kaha tha ki modi ko apane shabd waapas lene honge
 On this issue, spokespersons of both the parties jumped into the ground to defend their respective sides
 gaya ke bhaashan main to piem modi ne bihar ko 'bimaaru' rajya kaa darja de diya tha
 However, statistics show that Bihar has now come out of this status
 nitish kumaar ne baqayada press conference kar is par apana paksh rakhaa tha or modi ke bhaashan par kadi pratikriya jataai thi
 The pm's statement about DNA had hurt the BJP in the state while the Grand Alliance had benefited
 bataa den ki piem ke aise vivaadit bayaan se bijepi ko sirf bihar main hi nuksaan nahin hua tha
 Earlier in Delhi too, Arvind Kejriwal got sympathy with such statements of PM
 bijepi lok sabha ke saath kuch vidhansabhaon ke chunaav jeet kar ai thi
 Then elections were to be held in Delhi
 dilli bijepi ne ek aid campagne chalaaya
 Campaign to accuse Arvind Kejriwal by advertising in newspapers daily
 isi dauraan ek half pej kaa vigyaapan dekar arvind kejariwal ko 'updravi gotra' kaa bataaya gaya tha
 After this the electoral atmosphere had changed completely
 arvind kejariwal ne press conference kar yah masalaa uthaaya tha
 Kejriwal shared the sympathy of the people of Delhi and the result was revealed
 doosraa udhaaharan bhaashan main istemaal bimaaru shabd ko lekar he
 In his speech, PM Modi called Bihar as a BIMARU state and appealed to the people that if he votes for BJP, then in the next five years, he will bring Bihar out of BIMARU state to a developed state
 to kya jo centre sarkaar ke aankade bataa rahe hai vah jhuthe hai? piem modi ke bhaashan ke thik baad nitish kumaar ne yahi sawaal uthaaya tha
 During the Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi in his speeches had many such things which were beyond the facts
 behtareen adaakara rekha ne kuch dinon kii shooting ke baad abhishek kapur kii film 'fitur' ko karne se manaa kar diya he or ab is rale ke liye tabboo ko sin kar liya gaya he
 According to the news, Rarekhane wanted to re-shoot some shots after a few days of shooting
 baad memrekhane is film main kaam karne se hi manaa kar diya
 Actually Rekha did not like the final shots of the film, so she took this step
 lekin haal hi main film critic rajeev masand ne twit kar yah jaankaree di ki ab is film main rekha kii jagah tabboo ne le lee he, jisamen vah mahaan miss havisham kaa kirdaar adaa karatin najar aaengi
 JUST IN: Tabu replaces Rekha as the Miss Havisham character in Great Expectations adap Fitoor starring Aditya Roy Kapoor & Katrina Kaif
 — Rajeev Masand (@rajeevmasand)may 26, 2015film 'fitur' charles dicens ke ek upanyaas 'great expektemons' par aadhaarit film he jisamen mufti (akshay oberoi), begum miss havisham (tabboo) ko yuvavastha main dhokhaa detaa he
 Actress Aditi Rao Hydari is playing the young character of Tabu
 is film menaditya roy kapur(nur) aurakatrina caff(firdaus) bhi hai
 The film is expected to release on 12 February next year
 sahaj vaktaa ke gunmujhamenhin hai
 Perhaps that's why i was told to be the leader of the speech instead of giving the speech
 puri duniya ek vicitra uthal-puthal ke daur se guzar rahi he
 Non-equalization and insecurity remain a constant challenge to technology and engagement
 har jagah samaaj tej or thos badlaav ke daur se guzar rahaa he
 The same situation exists in our country
 hamaare logon main aakanksha, abhilaashaa, adheeratha or jaagrukta teji se bad rahi he
 Our institutions are still in the process of development and need to be revived
 aazaadee ke baad ke beete dashakon main sarkaron ne hamaare raashtra nirmaataaon kii viraasat ko aage badhaate hue lagaataar prayaas kiye hai
 Nevertheless, today we are being presented with an alternative view of what we were, what we are and what we should be
 yah vastav main hamen peeche dhakelne vaala he
 This view is based on the distorted concept of our history and is very fatal for our future
 ham ek khule vichaar vaale udaar loktantr rahe hai
 It has been based on representation and participation
 ise aisi rajnatik pratispardhaa se bal miltaa rahaa he jisamen niyamon, paramparaon or maryaadaaon kaa puraa khyaal rakhaa jaataa rahaa he
 Our open and liberal democracy has strengthened the unity of the country without imposing uniformity
 hamaare ganatantr ne na keval vividh vichaaron ko sammaan or sangrakshan diya he balki isane hameshaa charchaa-paricharchaa ko protsaahit kiya he
 Disagreements, dissatisfaction and protest have also found place here
 isane samvaad or samjhaute ke prati apni kshamtaaon kaa bhi parichay diya he
 Over the years, our democracy has been based on decency, debate and not on hudangai, ruckus and abusive language
 hamaara loktantr vichaar-vimarsh se bahumoolya banataa he ekapaksheeya atmalap se nahin, javabdehi se isamen sundarataa aati he na ki saarvajanik sawaalon or jaanch-parakh par ankush lagane se
 Our country, our society and our freedom - all are being constantly attacked
 yah sab ek sochi-samajhi ranneeti ke tahat ho rahaa he jisaki puri taiyaari kii gai he or bharat ko nae rang main rangane kii koshish ho rahi he
 History is being twisted, facts are being manipulated, nation makers are being insulted, prejudice is being fanned, and religious frenzy is being tried
 kya bharat 26 may, 2014 se pehle vaaki ek bada blike hole tha? kya bharat kii sari tarakkee, samruddhi or mahanata mahaj in chaar varshon kaa parinaam he? kya aisi baat kahana hamaare desh ke logon ke buddhi-vivek kaa apmaan nahin he?hamaare desh ne itane varshon main jo kuch uplabdhiyaan hasil kii hai use jaan-boojhkar khaarij karte janaa kuch or nahin, balki bas satta kaa ahankaar he
 To dismiss all our earlier achievements, which are the result of the common efforts of the people of the country, is nothing but a swagger, a pretense
 yah shrey lene vaali baat nahin he
 It is a matter of recognizing the power of India and the tireless efforts of Indians over the past several decades
 ham sabko gambhirtha se is baat par vichaar karnaa hoga ki kaise hamaare moolbhoot siddhanton or samvidhan ke mulyon par jaan-boojhkar aghat kiya ja rahaa he
 Comments to change the constitution show how some people look intent on capturing India's pride
 sattadhari paksh kii ore se aane vaale bhadakaau bayaan achaanak yaa bhul se die gaye nahin hote, yah to ek khatarnaak taiyaari kaa hissaa hai
 The evidence of this new and dangerous pattern will be seen all around you
 bhay or dhamkiyaan rosemara kii baaten ho chuki hai
 Apart from this, there is no freedom to say things, they are strangled
 hinsa se in awaajon ko dabaane kii koshish ho rahi he or pratirodh ke swar dabaane ke liye hatyaein tak kii ja rahi hai
 There is no room left for things like thinking in your own way, disagreements and resistance, food of your choice, meeting people, or freedom of marriage on your own terms
 in sab par hamale ho rahe hai
 Where there was an effort to increase harmony and harmony, people are engaged in increasing religious frenzy
 swayambhu paharuon ke hamalon or nijee senaaon ko sarkari sangrakshan mila he
 They are wandering fearlessly
 daliton or mahilaon ke prati asamvedansheeltaa khatarnaak str tak bad gai he
 Polarization is being promoted in our society and all these things have only one objective - winning elections
 sadiyon se bhartiya parampara or jeevanstyli aisi rahi he jaise kai dharaaen antat aakar ek main mil jaati hai
 This feeling is being erased
 hamaari sadiyon puraani saamaajik banaavat main chhedchhad karke ise nae tareeke se gande kii koshish ho rahi he
 This unnecessary effort of upheaval has resulted in frustration, resentment and anger among people, which will not result in good results
 log isse thodi der ke liye mantrmugdh bhale hi ho sakate hon, lekin hamaare ganatantr ko tatasth or majboot sansthaanon kii aavashyaktaa he
 a parliamentary majority should not be taken as a license to debate and dismantle laws
 jaanch agenciyon kaa prayog karke rajnatik virodhiyon ko nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 There is uproar in the judiciary
 civil socity kaa munh band kiya ja rahaa he
 Beds are being held at universities and students
 media ke ek bade hisse ko dhamkaaya ja rahaa he, taaki vah jaanch-padtaal kii apni bhoomika chhod de or prashasnic khaamiyon, ghotaalon or herapheri ko ujagar na kar sake
 The RTI Act was enacted to increase transparency and fight corruption
 aaj yah kanoon kisi thande baste main padaa hua he
 RTI activists are being killed
 aadhaar ko shashaktikaran kaa ek madhyam bananaa tha
 It is being used as a means of clamping screws
 ham gyaan-sanchalit samaaj bananaa chaahate hai lekin dekhie kis prakaar se vaigyanik swabhaav kaa majaak banaaya ja rahaa he or buddhijiviyon ko kaise thikaane lagaaya ja rahaa he
 The voice of politics is the music of democracy, but now this voice is being suppressed
 yah sab bharat ko 10 kharab dollar vaali arthvyavastha banane ke naam par ho rahaa he
 Of course, we need fast development but do it first and then do not think
 ham baar-baar dekh rahe hai ki chaahe vah arthvyavastha kaa vishay ho yaa padosiyon ke saath sambandh kii baat ho yaa suraksha se jude gambhir vishay or seemapar aatankwaad ho, faisle waapas liye ja rahe hai
 Does Maximum Governance Mean Minimum Truth? Does this mean alternative facts should be replaced by uncomfortable truths? Take the example of jobs
 har koi jaanata he ki rojgaar kii sthiti dayaneey he
 But suddenly we are being told that in 2017 75 lakh jobs were created
 roj-roj nai baaten kahi jaati raheen or arthvyavastha kii haalat badtar hoti gai
 The amount of cuts and cuts that have been seen on GST, it seems that any obstruction is being done in the name of reform without any preparation
 kisaan pareshaan the par unki sud lene main kitni der kii gai or unki pareshaaniyon ko dur karne kii koshish bhi aadhe-adhure hui
 a reinterpretation of the India idea requires Mansa covenant surrender to the guiding principles and values of our Constitution
 man, vachan se or karm teenon main iske prati samarpan jhalakana chahie
 In order to protect and strengthen institutions and the institutional process, we have to re-establish our resolve

 Officials said that although regular entry and exit will be controlled by the staff and personal security personnel maintained by the customer
 unhone kaha ki tainaati ko antim rup dene se pehle suraksha evam guptchar agency kii jaanch report se yah pataa chalaa he ki food park khatre kaa saamana kar rahaa he, kyonki yahaan gharelu evam videshi donon tarah ke paryatak aate hai

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) There are still 11 days left to cast the first vote for the Lok Sabha elections and the results will come on 16 May
 magar bijepi or sahyogi partiyon main awaajen uthni shuru ho gai hai ki agar narendra modi pradhanmantri banate hai, to up pradhanmantri koun banegaa
 Opposition parties are pinching that a large section within the party is active enough to ensure that the party does not get more than 160-170 seats in any event, so that someone like LK Advani, Sushma Swaraj or Rajnath Singh will replace Narendra Modi The leader could get a chance to become the Prime Minister
 bijepi ke bare main kaha ja rahaa he ki usamen do dhade hai
 a '170 group' who wants the party seats to not go above 170 so that someone else can become PM instead of Modi
 doosraa '270 group', jo modi ko pradhanmantri bananaa chahta he
 Obviously these are all hypothetical questions, but in politics anything can happen
 isiilie bijepi ke bheetar bhi modi virdohi apni baari kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 There are also allegations in the BJP that some leaders want that the party's seats should not go above 180 seats under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, so that Modi cannot become the Prime Minister
 in aaropon kii pushti ke liye ye daleelein di ja rahi hai ki kuch netaaon ke dabaav main party ne uttar pradesh or madhya pradesh main bade paimaane par galat tikat baante hai, taaki vahaan party kii sambhaavnaaon ko chot pahunchaai ja sake
 Similarly, claims have begun regarding the post of Deputy Prime Minister
 dilli ke netaaon main narendra modi ke kareebi maane jane vaale arun jetali amritsar se chunaav maidan main hai or unki pehali hi sabha main bijepi kii sahyogi party akali dal ke mukhiya prakaash singh badal ne kah diya ki jetali vittamantri banane ke saath-saath up pradhanmantri bhi banenge
 Jaitley, however, said not to give much weight to Badal's statement, similar to the speeches given during the election campaign
 isi bich, madhya pradesh ke vidisha se chunaav lard raheen sushamaa swaraj ke bare main purv mukhyamantri sunderlaal patwa ke bhattije or shivaraj singh chouhan sarkaar main mantri surendra patwa ne yahi baat kah di
 All these statements have given an opportunity to ridicule bjp's opponents, while Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has raised eyebrows
 bijepi main tikaton ko lekar chal rahi khinchataan par sangh pehle hi naaraazgi jataa chukaa he
 The Sangh had also made its stand clear regarding LK Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi, Sushma Swaraj and Jaswant Singh
 ab khabaron ke mutabik aresas ne saaf kar diya he ki bijepi main yaa to narendra modi pradhanmantri honge yaa phir koi nahin hoga
 Though the Sangh is confident that the BJP and its allies will come close to the majority, but if it does not, the BJP will not seek new allies to replace Modi with someone else to form the government
 sangh kii or se yah bhi kaha gaya he ki agar bijepi kii siten ummid ke anusaar nahin aati hai, to sarkaar bananaa yaa phir vipaksh main baithna yah bhi modi khud hi tay karenge
 Clearly, these signals from the Sangh are for all the leaders, who have their own ambitions
 sangh ko bade paimaane par bhitarghaat kaa dar bhi sata rahaa he or tikat bantwaare se yah baat saaf bhi ho rahi he
 The Sangh is also worried that the atmosphere created in Modi's favor should not be deteriorated due to the apprehension that the BJP can replace any other leader as prime minister if needed
 That is why it has been made clear
 lekin iske baavjood is baat kii koi guarantee nahin he ki modi ko rokane ke liye bijepi ke bheetar hi chal raheen koshishen ruk jaaengi
 Once again, his elder brother Mukesh Ambani can become the troublemaker for the economically troubled Anil Ambani's group
 anil ambani samooh kii company reliance communications (rcom) diwalia hone kii prakriya se guzar rahi he or ab ucch padasth sutron se khabar aa rahi he ki mukesh ambani ke reliance industries samooh kii company jeeyo arcom ke asset kharid sakati he
 rcom is going through an insolvency process and its assets are to be sold
 sutron ke anusaar, reliance jeeyo in asset ke liye boli lagane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 a senior official associated with this incident told our associate publication Business Today, 'this purchase is important for the Ambani brothers in two ways
 arcom ke spectrum or tower hasil karne se reliance jeeyo kii sevaaon main majbootee aegi jo ki ab 5ji shuru karne kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 On the other hand, the bankrupt company has a lot of land in Navi Mumbai (dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City or DAKC which Dhirubhai acquired in the 90s)
 'aarkam par he 46000 karod kaa karjgauratlab he ki diphalt ke samay reliance communications ke paas kul 46,000 karod rupee kaa karj tha
 According to sources, Jio has handed over its fiber and tower business to two infrastructure investment trusts and also cut its debt to make room for rcom's purchase and 5G investment
 jeeyo kaa kanoonee vibhaag arcom kii diwalia prakriya par gaharaai se najar rakhe hue he
 In March, Mukesh Ambani saved his younger brother Anil from prison and paid Rs 580 crore to repay Anil's company to Sweden-based Ericsson, in a surprise surprise in March
 arcom kaa mukesh ambani parivaar ke saath bhi bhaavnaatmak rishta he, kyonki isaki shuruyaat avibhajit parivaar dwaara pita dhirubhai ambani ke sapane ko puraa karne ke liye 2000 ke dashak main kii gai thi
 Jio is still using rcom spectrum in 850 mhz band in 21 circles of the country including Mumbai
