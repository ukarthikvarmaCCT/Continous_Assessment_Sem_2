 bharat ko 2010 ke singapore youth olympic main 8 padak mili, lekin usamen ek bhi swarna shaamil nahin rahaa
 The same happened for the 2014 Nanjing Youth Olympics, where India won two medals, but did not open the gold account

 Team Anna is upset due to not enough crowd in Anna's fast in Mumbai and it seems that Baba Ramdev is being taken to mobilize
 baba ramdev ke anna ke samarthan main jald hi mumbai pahunchane kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 This is also surprising because Anna has said once before that his Ramdev movements are different and he is not with them
 lekin, ramdev ko bheed jutanaa aata he or anna ke teen dinon ke is anshan kaa agar koi asar sansad par hoga to janata kii bheed se hi hoga
 And at this time, Team Anna is the most needed crowd
 lekin, pehle din, is maamle main kam se kam team anna koi bada score nahin khadaa kar pai
 Unlike the expectations of Team Anna, which is staging and fasting at Ramlila Maidan, very few people reached the ground in the morning on the second day
 team anna kii ore se ramlila maidan main teen din subah 10 baje se shaam chah baje tak dharne or anshan kaa aayojan kiya he
 On 27 December, the first day of the fast, there was very less crowd and there was a delay of 90 minutes in the beginning of the program
 maidan main kareeb saadhe das baje tak manch par team anna kaa koi sadsy nahin pahunchaa tha
 Kiran Bedi, who is a key member of Team Anna, is scheduled to reach Ramlila Maidan on Wednesday
 duusare din ke kaarykram kii shuruyaat main vilamb or kam bheed ke bare main team anna ke ek swayamsevi ne kaha, kam bheed he
 But it is expected that as the day progresses, people will come out of the houses and take the field

 Will the BJP contest Rajasthan elections this time on the issue of Hindutva? The way BJP has not given ticket to any Muslim candidate in its first list, many questions are being raised
 darasal, rajasthan main shuru se hibijepi vidhansabha chunaavamein 6 se 4 muslim ummidavaaron ko tikat detii rahi he, lekin is baar 5 baar ke vidhayak rahe nagaur ke bijepi vidhayak habiburrahman kaa tikat kaat diya gaya he
 The ruling BJP released the first list of candidates for the elections a day earlier
 200 sadasyeey vidhansabha ke liye 131 ummidavaaron kii pehali list main 12 mahilaon or 32 yuva chehron ko mauka diya gaya jabaki isamen muslim naam nadaarad hai
 Government's number 2 name also missing! Younus Khan, who has been holding the number 2-2 (PWD and Roadways) as the number two in the government for the last 5 years, is missing from the first list
 isi tarah sikar or jhunjhunu main bijepi muslim ummidavaar khadaa karti ai he jahaan par is baar tikat nahin diya he
 Apart from this, Sagir Ahmad has also been a MLA twice from Khulavasundhara Raje area Dholpur, but this time he has not been given a ticket
 vasundhara raaje ke chunaav kshetra jhalawad main bhi muslim badi sankhya main vasundhara raaje ko vot dete aae hai or vahaan par unke chunaav kaa puraa jimmaa asad ali sambhalate hai or jhalawad ke bijepi daftar bhi asad ali ke ghar se chalata he
 Vasundhara Raje has always been talking about taking 36 of 36 communities together, but this time Vasundhara Raje has had to bow to the pressure of the Sangh in many seats
 yogi adityanath kii 40 reliyanaise main mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi kii rajasthan main ghatati lokapriyata ko bharne ke liye bijepi hindutv ke agenda par savaar ho sakati he
 The absence of Muslim candidates from the BJP remains a matter of discussion
 is baar rajasthan ke chunaav main 40 reliyaan uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kii rakhi gai hai
 Apart from this, four road shows will also be performed by Yogi Adityanath
 yogi adityanath kaa is tarah se rajasthan main raily or sabha karwaanaa yah dikhaata he ki bijepi rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav main apana brahmastra hindutv ko chal sakati he
 Even before this, BJP has been standing with its party worker and MLA in riots like mob lynching and Bundi Jaitaran
 nagaur main aresasnagaur membijapike do vidhayak jitate rahe hai
 Five-time MLA Habibur Rahman and Younis Khan, the minister closest to Vasundhara, are said to be seeing Nagaur as a laboratory of their Hindutva if they are denied tickets
 pichley 5 saalon main sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat do baar nagaur main pravaas kar chuke hai
 Apart from this, many minorities have been arrested in Nagaur in terrorist incidents in Delhi
 nagaur main bharat mata ke khilaaf naare lagane par 10 muslim ladke bhi lambey samay tak jail main rahe
 On this matter, when the BJPK spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi was asked why BJP has not given any Muslim candidate a place in the first list
 sudhanshu trivedi ne kaha ki congress ne abhi tak musalamaanon ko tikat dekar unhen thaga he
 The problems of education, hunger and poverty in the minority society are all due to the Congress
 tikat dene nahin dene se koi fark nahin padataa

 The country should know what happens in repeated secret meetings between Modi and Nawaz Sharif
 kapil mishra nepradhanmantrishpathgrahan ko yaad karte hue likhaa ki hindustan ko modi ji ne sabase pehla jhatka tab diya, jab loksabhaa chunaav jitate hi apane shapath grahan main navaj sharif ko vishesh atithi ke taur par bulaayaa
 That day, the body language of both of them was not such that the two enemies are the leaders of the country
 unke rishte kii garmaahat or ek-duusare ke pariwaron ke liye die ja rahe gift aise the, jaise do bhai mili hon
 Modi and Nawaz Sharif did not miss any opportunity to meet each other due to the fact that many times happened
 chaahe paris kii climet summit ho yaa rashia kii SCO meet, bainkak ho yaa shanghai yaa washington
 Both of them found some way out, alone to do a thing
 kuch vakt saath bitaane kaa
 Kapil has written that if you search, there are hundreds of pictures where both are busy talking to each other in isolation
 inmulakatonmen in donon ke alaava or koi adhikari nahin dikhataa
 Somewhere in the corner of a couch both things are busy
 kahin gale lagate hue, haathon main haath daale chalate hue
 As if it is a very secretive and personal thing jaise koi deal ho
 The attack on Pathankot after the meeting of modi-nawaz was a shock on that day, on the day Modi suddenly reached Nawaz Sharif's house for a birthday party
 us din bhi vahaan modi or navaj sharif ke bich kaaphi der tak akele main baaten huin
 It is discussed that there were also a few very big traders present
 us din kya baat hui, modi ji kyon gaye, kisi ko kuch nahin maaloom
 a few days after the Lahore meeting, there is a terrorist attack on our Air Force's Pathankot airbase
 ye ab tak kaa hindustani sainya pratishthanon par hue sabase bade hamalo main se ek tha
 Targeting the ISI, Pathankot Airbasekapil Mishra has written that Modi government has decided to call the ISI to investigate the Pathankot attack
 usee ISI ko jisane hameshaa hamaare desh par hamalaa karavaaya, sainikon ko maravaaya
 It was the ISI that attacked Pathankot
 ham sab us kaale or ghinaune din ke gavaah hai, jis din ISI ke adhikari muskuraate hue pathankot airbase ke andar khud ke karaae hamale kii jaanch karne ja rahe the or hamaari senaaon ke vir javaanon ko ISI waalon ko suraksha dene ke liye lagaaya hua tha, jaise kisi VIP kii suraksha kii jaati he
 'let the country be told the truth of the relationship' Now is the time that the country was told that what was being cooked between Modi ji and Nawaz Sharif for so many days? Now is the time that the country be taken into confidence whether there is any secret deal between Modi ji and Nawaz Sharif? What happened in so many secret meetings happened in the past, what decisions have been made, now the country should be told
 desh ko puraa adhikaar he ye jaanane kaa ki modi or navaj sharif ke bich is gahare pyaar, sachhee dosti, atoot bhaichaare kaa raaj kya he? Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghuvar Das will hand over free LPG connections, stove and gas cylinders to the sisters of the state on the occasion of Bhaiya Dooj

 Mutuvel Karunanidhi's struggle began from an early age when he refused to learn his father from Nadaswaram, which was his father's means of livelihood
 yuva karunanidhi ke man main krodh kii aag tabhi sulag gai thi jab unhone apane shikshak ko oonchi jati ke logon ke saamne jane se pehle apane upree angon par pahane kapade utaarte or nange badan jate dekha
 Born on June 3, 1924, to the family of Mutuvellar and Anjugam of the backward Eisivalar community at Tirukkulai near Tiruvarur, Karunanidhi was ignorant of caste inequality and a rebellious young man from the habit of the lower caste to silently tolerate the oppressors
 Had gone
 aage chalakar unhone pichhadi jatiyon ke liye 69 pratishat aarakshan sunishchit kiya or in prayaason ke liye unhen 'samuga nidhi kavaler (saamaajik nyaay ke sangrakshak)' ke rup main sammanit kiya gaya
 He dreamed of a classless society, in which communities like Samtuvapuram were formed across the state, where people of all castes and religions lived together
 karunanidhi kaa rajnatik sangharsh maatr 13 saal kii umr main tab shuru hua jab unhone madras presidency ke skulon main hindi kii anivaary shiksha ke virodh main rajyastareey andolan main hissaa liya
 a legend has it that he sliced his palm and extracted blood from it and wrote 'tamil Vaja' (tamil Zindabad) on the walls of Thiruvarur, where he received his schooling

 'periyar' came under the influence of Ramaswamy, who started the self-esteem movement
 unhone periyar kii patrika kudi aarasu kaa sampadan shuru kiya
 Periyar's stance was totalitarian, which soon made his admirers like Annadurai feel suffocated as he favored political empowerment and through it the creation of a new social order
 jab annadurai periyar se alag hue to karunanidhi bhi unke saath ho liye
 Anna founded the DMK in 1949 and Karunanidhi played an important role in building a strong rival party in front of the Congress party
 ek anya yuva, emji ramchandran bhi unke saath aa mili
 The trio was interested in theater but soon moved to films and proved to be an influential tool for them
 mjiaar hero bane or karunanidhi ne apni andolit karne vaali patakatha or aawaaj se filmi parde par dhak jamaai
 Karunanidhi was at the forefront of all DMK agitations and was imprisoned several times
 unhone daalamiapuram shahar kaa naam badalakar uskaa mul tamil naam kalkakkudi rakhane ke liye andolan kaa netritv kiya or rail kii patariyon par let gaye
 His slogan 'tamil Angle Muchu (tamil is our breath)' became a mantra for many generations of Tamils
 1967 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main dramuk ne tatkaaleen madras rajya main congress ko haraa diya
 Neither Anna nor Karunanidhi even had a rough idea then that this victory would not only change the socio-political history of the state but would usher in an era dominated by the non-congress Dravidian party in Tamil Nadu
 annadurai mukhyamantri bane or karunanidhi lok nirmaan mantri
 But Anna did not live long
 jab 1969 main uttaradhikaar kaa sawaal aayaa tab ek kareebi dost or saathi kalakaar mjiaar ne karunanidhi ko party kaa netaa chune jane main sahaayta kii
 MGR also helped the party win elections in 1971
 karunanidhi, mjiaar ke kareebi to the par unhen koi aadhikarik pad dene ko lekar satark the
 However, now MGR also became an MLA
 mjiaar ne karunanidhi ke 'bhrasht shashan' par hamalavar rukh apana liya
 MGR formed the new party All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kadagam (AIADMK)
 jab karunanidhi ne dramuk kii kaman sanbhali thi, to unhen karishmai netaa nahin mana jaataa tha, kam se kam mjiaar kii tulana main to bilkul hi nahin
 But Karunanidhi's personal appeal was an important factor in increasing the dmk's continued strength and solidarity
 dramuk khud ko ek bada parivaar maanati he, or karunanidhi party ke abhibhavak hai
 He was accused of making the party a family fiefdom, but as he was taking his last breath, the crowd gathered at the time was expressing that he was still the party's dearest guardian

 (input bhashaa se) (from input language) sutron ke mutabik saamaajik nyaay mantri thavarchand gahalot mangalvaar ko sansad main vidheyak pesh kar sakate hai
 The support of two-thirds of the members is required to pass it
 sutron ne bataaya ki loksabhaa main paarit hone ke baad ise rajyasabha ko bheja jayega
 The BJP has issued a whip asking all its mps to remain in the Lok Sabha
 vahiin, congress ne shanivaar ko apane saansadon ko vip jari kar unase somvaar or mangalvaar ko sansad main maujuud rahane ko kaha tha
 Through this bill, for the first time an attempt has been made to give reservation on non-caste and non-religious basis
 prastaavit aarakshan anusuchit jatiyon (essi), anusuchit janajatiyon (asti) or anya pichhadaa virgon (obisi) ko mil rahe aarakshan kii 50 fisadi seemaa ke atirikt hoga, yani ‚Äòaarthik rup se kamjor' tabakon ke liye aarakshan lagu ho jane par yah aankada badhakar 60 fisadi ho jayega
 For implementation of the proposal, the Constitution Amendment Bill will need to be passed by the Parliament, because there is no provision for reservation on economic basis in the Constitution
 iske liye samvidhan ke anuchhed 15 or anuchhed 16 main jaruri sanshodhan karne honge
 To get the Constitution Amendment Bill passed in Parliament, the government will have to muster at least two-thirds majority in both houses
 loksabhaa main to sarkaar ke paas bahumat he, lekin rajyasabha main uske paas apane dam par vidheyak paarit karaane ke liye jaruri sankhyabal kaa abhaav he
 Through the Constitution Amendment Bill, adding a clause in Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution will provide for reservation for economically weaker sections in educational institutions and government jobs
 ab tak samvidhan main essi-asti ke alaava saamaajik evam shaikshanik taur par pichde virgon ke liye aarakshan kaa praavdhaan he, lekin isamen aarthik rup se kamjor logon kaa koi zikr nahin he
 The proposed legislation will benefit many other forward castes including Brahmins, Rajputs (thakurs), Jats, Marathas, Bhumihars, many mercantile castes, Kapu and Kamma
 sutron ne bataaya ki anya dharmon ke garibon ko bhi aarakshan kaa laabh milegaa
 a provision can be made in this bill that those who have an annual income of less than Rs 8 lakh and who have less than five acres of agricultural land, can get the benefit of reservation
 sutron ne bataaya ki aise logon ke paas nagar nikaay kshetra main 1000 varg foot yaa isse zyada kshetrafal kaa flats nahin hona chahie or gaiyr-adhishuchet kshetron main 200 yard se zyada kaa flats nahin hona chahie
 The BJP termed the Modi government's move as 'historic' while the opposition questioned its timing
 congress ne ise ‚Äò‚Äòchunavi jumala'' qaraar diya

 a Mumbai sessions court has dismissed the social worker's plea seeking intervention in the 2002 hit and run case
 is maamle main bollywood star salmaan khan aaropee hai
 Justice SD Deshpande ruled that only the affected party, the complainant or the witness had the right to intervene
 adaalat ne kaha ki is maamle main yachika daayar karne vaale santosh dandkar na to gavaah hai, na hi shikayatakarta or na hi sambandhit paksh, isliye unhen hastkshep kii anumati nahin milani chahie

 is maamle main police par galat gavaah pesh karne kaa aarope lagaaya gaya, jisase sunwaayee main deree ho rahi he
 The judge said that it is not within his jurisdiction to transfer the complaint

 Salman Khan has filed a petition in the 2002 hit and run case demanding that the media be given a true and impartial report of the proceedings, on which the court deferred the decision till 15 October

 As the matter is pending in the High Court, the sessions court will not pass any judgment on the actor's plea

 In view of the increasing pollution in Delhi, Delhi government is angry with the government for not making an action plan
 is babat engiti ne dilli sarkaar ke paryaavaran mantralay ke dipti secretary ko talab kiya he or unhen 25 oktober ko pesh hone ke liye kaha he
 The petition has been filed in the NGT that during the last several years of hearing, the Delhi government said that whenever pollution increases in Delhi, action plan will be worked out

 The loss of which the general public of Delhi is suffering
 engiti ne kaha ki dilli main pradooshan kii sthiti lagaataar bad se badtar hoti ja rahi he or philhal puri dilli gambhir pradooshan se jujh rahi he
 Actually, the situation of pollution changes in Delhi with the change of weather and in view of this, when pollution increases, the Delhi government has to implement its action plan regarding climate change
 jisase pradooshan ko naa sirf niyantran main laayaa ja sake balki badhane se bhi roka ja sake
 In view of this action plan, the Delhi government has to stop construction related work, spraying water everywhere, issuing advisory, so that common people use masks
 aspataalon main bhi khaas vyavastha kii jaati he, jisase pradooshan ke shikaar log jab aspataal pahunche to unke liye khaas intjaam ho
 Due to increase in pollution, schools are also discharged so that children become the least victims
 sunwaayee ke dauraan engiti isi baat ko lekar dilli sarkaar se naaraaz dikhaa ki abhi tak sarkaar pradooshan se nipatane ke liye cover karne ko taiyaar nahin dikh rahi he
 That is why the NGT has fixed a re-hearing date on October 25 in this case and has also ordered that the Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Environment should appear in the court and explain what his efforts so far in Delhi NCR to deal with pollution Have been introduced
 dilli main har saal sardiyon kii shuruyaat se pehle hi pradooshan kii samasya vikaraal rup dhaaran kar leti he

 Now the question is also arising that do political parties of India simply raise slogans about Dawood or are the governments really trying to bring him back? darasal daaud kaa maamla bharat main ek raajnneetik maamla bhi ban gaya he

 The 22-year-old Shiva, who was competing in his second Olympics, lost 0‚Äì3 in a one-sided match
 is mukaable ke dauraan unki baayin aankh ke upar cat bhi lag gaya
 Both boxers started cautiously in the first round
 donon mukkebaaz junior toornamenton main khilne ke dauraan se ek duusare ke khel se parichit hai
 Both have competed against each other in the final of Youth World Championship and Youth Olympics 2010
 aaj ke mukaable se pehle romirejane bhartiya mukkebaaz ke khilaaf apane donon match jite the or aaj teesri jeet darj karne main bhi unhen adhik mashkkat nahin kerani padi
 The comments landan olympic main flivet varg ke swarna padak vijeta romirej ne daayen haath se kuch dhansu mukke jamaaye
 The Cuban boxer showed superb footwork and managed to penetrate Shiva's defense
 duusare round main bhi vishwa championships ke kaansya padak vijeta shiv ko romirej ke khilaaf jujhna padaa jinhen darshakon kaa bhi puraa samarthan mil rahaa tha
 Nothing new was seen in the third round as well and Romirez dominated the game to win
 shiv ko chaar saal pehle olympic main padaarpan ke dauraan bhi pehle daur main hi haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Indian hopes now weigh on Vikas Krishna (75 kg) and Manoj Kumar (64 kg), who both qualified for the pre-quarterfinals
 gauratlab he ki thapa bhi apane bharvarg kii vishwa ranking main chathe sthaan par hai, lekin vah tadarth samiti dwaara kuch gadabadiyon ke kaaran variyata paane main asafal rahe the
 According to the new boxing rules made by the International Boxing Association (AIBA), preference for the Olympics is to be decided on the basis of performance in professional boxing (APB) and Boxing World Series (WSB)
 tadarth samiti ne bhartiya mukkebaajon ko is niyam kii jaankaree nahin di jiske kaaran thapa ne apibi main hissaa nahin liya
 That led them to meet the Cuban seeded boxer in the first round
 pehle round main donon mukkebaajon ne satark shuruyaat kii
 Both boxers are familiar with each other's sports while playing in junior tournaments
 donon youth vishwa championships or youth olympic 2010 ke final main ek duusare se bhid chuke hai

 Comma kaa prayog vaakya ke bich main tehraav ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Comma is derived from the Greek word 'komma', which means a small part of a sentence
 Comma or Punctuation ke bare main kuch rochak fact
 
 
 1
 pehle Komma ko do chote vaakyon ko alag karne vaala viraam chinh nahin samajha jaataa tha
 Komma meant the clause itself which had to be separated
 2
 Colons, Periods and other punctuation marks were also used to separate sentences
 vaakyon kii lambaai or jatilta ko dekhte hue alag-alag viraam chinhon kaa prayog kiya jaataa tha
 3
 Comma kaa avishkaar 200 BC Egyptian librarian, Aristophanes of Bysantium dwaara hua tha, jinhone nayakon ke bolne main suvidha pradaan karne ke liye sankethik pranali nikaali thi
 4
 aksharon ke avishkaar ke pehle log sabakuch yaad karte the
 When the letters were invented, no punctuation marks were used
 do shabdon ke bich jagah bhi nahin chodi jiti thi
 There was a lot of confusion in reading
 5
 The use of Comma became mandatory after the invention of the printing press
 6
 Modern comma was first used by Aldus Manutius, the founder of Aldine Press in Venice
 Comma kaa modern use: nae jamaane main comma kaa durupyog bhi hota he, jisase kanfusion to badhata hi he saath hi saath arth kaa anarth bhi ho jaataa he
 We will give you some rules of using comma with examples which will make your problem easier: 1
 comma kaa prayog shabdon ke samooh, vaakyanshon ko alag karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Like- i am taking Hindi, English and History in next semester
 2
 Comma is used to separate non-essential words from the main clause
 inhen shuruyaat, madhya yaa ant main prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Like- In my opinion, the movie was more compelling than the book
 3
 Many adjectives that describe the same noun word are distinguished from comma
 jaisai- This is a very, very violent movie
 4
 'which' ke prayog ke samay comma lagaate hai, lekin 'that'se pehle comma nahin lagata
 Like- John's cars, which are leased, are never kept clean
 5
 When addressing someone directly, put comma before his name
 jaise- We could not have done it without you, Priya
 6
 kisi vyakti ke naam ke baad yadi uskaa pad naam yaa degree likhnaa he to naam ke baad comma lagaate hai
 Like- The award was handed over by Sundar Pichai, CEO, Google
 7
 If you want to write both a day and a date, then apply comma after the day
 jaise- The store closed its door on Wednesday, October 15, 1958
 8
 lokation bataate samay comma kaa prayog karte hai
 like-that company is headquarted in Chicago, Illinois
 9
 Use comma to increase readability of numbers
 jaise- We sold 1,650 rare books last year, the most expensive sold for Rs
 2,55,255
 50
 10
 jab kisi shabd ko quote karte hai tab comma kaa prayog hota he
 Like - 'I was able,' "she answered, 'to complete the assignment

 There is growing anger across the country about unbridled prices of petrol and diesel
 sawaal ye he ki vittamantri arun jetali kii aguwai vaali jiesti council kya petroleum mantri dharmendra pradhan kii us salaah par dhyaan degi, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki petroleum utpaadon kii badhati keemton ko thaamne ke liye inhen jiesti ke daayre main laana jaruri he
 Dharmendra Pradhan had tweeted that 'the only way to bring it under GST is for fair prices of petroleum products
 ' bataa den ki petroleum padaarthon kii keemten pichley teen saalon main sabase oonche str par pahunch gai hai
 Bringing petroleum products under the purview of GST will bring down prices
 mumbai main petrol kii keemten 80 rupaya prati litre ko chhu gai he, to dilli main yah 70 rupaya prati litre ke kareeb he
 If petrol is brought under the purview of GST, it will cost 38 in Delhi at 12 percent tax rate of GST
 10 rupaya prati litre hogi
 Petrol was last sold at Rs 70 per liter in August 2014, but at that time the price of crude oil was US $ 98 per barrel
 lekin, ab kachche tel kii keemten 50 yues dollar bairal ke kareeb gum rahi hai
 Why is petrol and diesel selling so expensive? According to the data released by the Indian Oil Corporation about the rising prices of petrol in Delhi, the price of one liter of petrol in the refinery is 26
 65 rupaya prati litre pad rahi he
 30 to dealers
 70 rupaya prati litre padataa he
 But, petrol 70 in Delhi
 39 rupaya prati litre bik rahaa he
 This means that 39 per liter
 41 rupaya tex ke rup main or dealron ke kamishan ke rup main ja rahaa he
 Now, while most of the products have come under the purview of GST
 petroleum padaarth ab bhi waite system ke daayre main hai
 Petroleum products have different prices due to different VAT prices in different states
 petroleum planning or analysis cell (pipiasi) ke uplabdh data ke mutabik dilli main petrol par 27 pratishat waite lagata he, mumbai, thane or navi mumbai main yah 47
 64 percent
 isaki vajah se do shaharon main petrol kii keemton main 9 rupee ke antar ko samajha ja saktaa he
 Central government share in petrol prices: Central government imposes excise duty on petrol and diesel
 pipiasi ke data ke mutabik november 2014 ke baad se petrol par exise duty 54 pratishat bad gai he
 If we look at VAT, there is a 46 percent increase on an average basis
 vahiin petrol par dealron ke kamishan main 73 fisadi kaa ijapha hua he
 Similarly, in the case of diesel, the excise duty has increased by 154 percent
 waite main 48 fisadi kii vruddhi he, jabaki dealron kaa kamishan 73 pratishat ke kareeb he
 Excise duty on petrol and diesel has been increased 12 times since 2014
 petroleum utpaadon par centre or rajya sarkaar ke dohare tex kii vajah se petrol or dijal kii keemten ek baar phir aasmaan ko chhu rahi hai, jabaki kachche tel kii keemton main 2014 ke mutabik tulanaatmak aadhaar par 50 fisadi kii kami ai he
 However, surprisingly, the revenue from petroleum products in 2014-15 was 3
 32 lakh karod tha or 2016-17 main yah 5
 24 lakh crore
 petroleum ke GST ke daayre main aane par kya hoga?petrol or dijal ke jiesti ke tahat aane par keemton main badi giravat aegi
 Five rates of tax in GST
 
 
 0, 5, 12, 18 or 28 fisadi he
 However, petrol and diesel cannot be kept below the 12 per cent tax limit
 aise main 12 fisadi tex rate ke hisaab se dilli main petrol kii keemten 38
 1 rupee per liter
 joki maujuuda keemat se 32 rupaya sasta hoga
 Petrol price 40 in Delhi as per 18% tax rate
 05 rupaya prati litre hoga or 28 fisadi kii dar se dilli main isaki keemat 43
 44 rupees per liter
 agar jiesti ke tahat petrol par 28 fisadi tex rate ke upar esayuvi ses lagaaya jaataa he, to dilli main ek litre petrol kii keemat 50
 91 per liter
 joki maujuuda keemat se 20 rupaya kam hogi
 Similarly, the current price of diesel 58 in Delhi
 72 rupaya prati litre he
 Its price 36 as per 12 per cent GST
 65 rupaya prati litre hogi
 Diesel 38 as per 18% GST
 61 rupaya prati litre bikega
 48 in Diesel Delhi as per 28% GST rate
 88 rupaya prati litre hoga
 49 for one liter of fuel to customers if the SUV is cased
 08 rupaya prati litre dena hoga
 9 from the current price
 64 rupaya sasta hoga
 But there is also a lot of politics on bringing petroleum products under the purview of GST
 jiesti act ke mutabik petroleum utpaadon ko laane kaa iske daayre main laane kaa faisla keval jiesti council hi kar sakati he
 Keep in mind that the states also have participation in the GST Council
 aise main petroleum utpaadon ko jiesti main laana tedi kheer jaisaa he

 With his return, a new communication of enthusiasm has been created in the workers and the same enthusiasm can be maintained till the elections
 navaj kii 'shahadat' par votpmail-enke liye yah aisa nayab mauka haath laga he jiske jariye vah apane kaaryakartaaon ko matdaan se kareeb 2 hafte pehle phir se sakriy kar matadaataaon ke paas jaakar navaj kii 'shahadat' par vot dene ko kah sakati he
 If this happens, then the good days can start again for the Sharif family, who are facing one crisis after another
 'sahanubhuti card' khel rahe navajpichley hafte paak kii ek adaalat kii ore se sajaa kaa elaan kiye jane ke turant baad navaj ne landan main apni beti mariyam ke saath pisi kar khud ko peedit bataaya or kaha ki vah chor nahin hai or jald hi pakistan lautenge
 He said, 'my struggle from jail will continue
 yah mere sangharsh kaa ek hissaa he
 He then played a 'sympathy card' and said, 'I promise that my struggle will continue till the people of the country are freed from the slavery imposed on them by some generals and judges
 main desh se apil karata hum ki ve mere saath aae or is najuk kshan main mujhe akelaa na choden
 'he spoke of returning home soon
 iske kuch hi dinon ke andar navaj ne apni beti ke saath swadesh vaapasi kaa elaan kar diya
 His return was to be announced that the Government of Pakistan started making plans to arrest him
 lekin navaj apni giraftaar ko you hi jaaya nahin hone dena chaahate the
 Mother also played a 'sympathy card' before she was arrested
 apni beti ke saath press ke saamne aae or phir apnibimaar bivi kulsum sharifka zikr kar paak janata ko ek peedit ke taur par sabit karne kii koshish kii
 This can be called part of their well thought out strategy
 landan ke aspataal main bhartee kulsum cancer se jujh rahi hai or unki haalat kaaphi gambhir he
 On the other hand, Nawaz's mother Shamim Akhtar, living in Pakistan, issued a video message on Thursday saying that she will not leave her son Nawaz and granddaughter Maryam alone
 agar navaj ko jail hui to vah bhi unke saath jail jaaengi
 Both are innocent and they are being conspired against
 'musharraf jaisaa bujdil nahin'iske baadpakistanke liye ravaanaa hone se pehle landan main navaj ne kaha, 'main parvej musharraf nahin hum ki chhupakar bujdil kii tarah videsh main baith jaaoongaa
 The person who conspired against me is playing a bad game with the country
 saal 1971 main bhi aisa hi khel khelaa gaya tha or desh ke do tukade ho gaye the
 'it was very natural for him to mention Musharraf on this issue because like Nawaz, the whole country knows that this former Pakistani dictator has been driven out of the country in the matter of corruption and his image is not very good in the country
 musharraf hi nahin balki desh ke kai anya bade or rasukhdaar netaa bhi bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagane ke baad desh chhodkar baahar bhaag gaye or waapas palatakar saamne nahin aae
 On the contrary, Nawaz continued to cooperate in the corruption case
 landan main posh evenfield house main chaar flaton ke swaamitv se jude evenfield bhrashtachar maamle main sau se zyada baar hui sunwaayee main khud navaj kareeb 90 maukon par khud pesh hue yaa phir jaanch main sahyog diya
 After this, within a week of the declaration of sentence, he himself returned home and was arrested
 imran khan ke liye 'duvidha'khayr, navaj or unki beti mariyam ko lahore airport se giraftaar kar rawalpindi ke aadiyaala central jail bheja jayega
 Both passports have been confiscated
 bahut sambhaavna he ki donon ab kal court se jamaanat kii arji daakhil kar sakate hai kyonki paak ke kanoon ke anusaar jamaanat kii arji tabhi daakhil kii ja sakati he jab usne sarender kar diya ho
 After both of them return to the country, the political parties there will have to devise a fresh electoral strategy for the general election as the PML-N has taken an edge over other parties
 ab imran khan ko centre kii satta par kabiz hona he to shesh bache 2 hafton main edi chotii kaa jor lagaana hoga

 It is also being said that Salman advised Katrina that he should come before the people with the truth
 isse katrina ko kuch halkaa mahasoos hoga
 It is a different matter how seriously Katrina will now take Salman's advice
 bataa den ki jab se katrina or ranbir kapur main sambandhon main khatas kii baaten ai hai tab se katrina kai maukon par media waalon se rou-ba-rou hui hai or unhen hameshaa hi ranbir se jude dheron sawaalon kaa jawaab dene ke liye kaha jaataa he or aise main vah kaaphi asahaj ho jaati hai
 At the same time, Ranbir Kapoor has not met the media ever since the news of the relationship broke out

 salmaan ne katrina ko mehnatee or ek majboot mahila bataaya
 Not only this, Salman praised Katrina's dance to her beauty and acting
 baavjood iske sho main donon ke bich kaaphi nonk jhonk hui
 There was talk of a confrontation between the two
 ye to sabhi ko yaad hoga ki salmaan khan kii vajah se hi katrina caff ko bollywood main kadam jamaane kaa mauka mila
 There were reports of Salman and Katrina having a long love affair and then their separation
 katrina or aditya ko sho ke ek finlist ko baahar nikaalane kii jimmedaari di gai thi
 When Katrina told him that she would have been terrified if she had been in his place
 is par salmaan ne unhen khud ko kam na aankane ko kaha or unhen ek behad majboot mahila bataaya
 Some people also say that Salman Khan also talked to Katrina about the flaws in the relationship between off camera Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina
 kaha to yah bhi ja rahaa he ki salmaan ne katrina ko salaah di ki vah sach ke saath logon ke saamne aae
 This will make Katrina feel somewhat lighter
 ye alag baat he ki katrina ab salmaan kii salaah ko kitna gambhirtha se lengi
 Let me tell you that ever since Katrina and Ranbir Kapoor's relationship has soured, Katrina has been interacting with the media on several occasions and she is always asked to answer many questions related to Ranbir
 And in such a situation she becomes very uncomfortable
 vahiin, jabase sambandhon main daraar kii khabaren baahar nikali hai tab se ranbir kapur media se mukhaatib nahin hue hai
 The reason behind not using the word martyr is that there is no provision in the police manual nor in the law of the army

 He said that this is a proof of the government's inaction that even now the court did not trust the intention of the government
 adaalat kii tippanee ke alok main centre sarkaar puri tarah se benakaab ho gai he
 Significantly, the Supreme Court bench has said that the problem of black money is the result of serious government lapse, which has an impact on the internal and external security of the country
 kaale dhan ko ‚Äòdesh ke liye bahut zyada khatarnaak‚Äô bataate hue adaalat ne kaha ki videshi bainkon main jitani maatra main kaala dhan jamaa hota he, vah kisi desh kii ‚Äòkamajori‚Äô yaa ‚Äònarmi‚Äô kaa mote taur par paimaana mana ja saktaa he
 Accusing the Congress-led government of looting the black money case, Javadekar said, "the BJP demands that the government make a strict law in the monsoon session of Parliament to declare black money stashed abroad as national property and punish the guilty
" Introduce the bill ‚Äô bhaajapa pravaktaa ne aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar bhrashtachar or videshon main kalaadhan jamaa karne waalon kaa sangrakshan kar rahi he
 It is protecting Congressmen who have deposited black money abroad in the last 60 years on the pretext of double taxation avoidance treaty

 At an event organized on June 28 to mark the 10th death anniversary of the state's respected Christian missionary Prem Bhai, Chief Minister Pema Khandu announced that his government would abolish the Arunachal Pradesh Religious Freedom Act enacted in 1978 to prevent religious conversion
 mukhyamantrine kaha ki yah kanoon dharm kii aazaadee par bandish lagaataa he or dharmanirpeksh bharat main isaki koi jagah nahin he
 The Chief Minister told India Today, "in today's context, this law has no meaning for Christians, native beliefs and any other religion
" isse kisi bhi dharmik samooh ko na to koi nuksaan pahunchataa he or na hi koi madad milti he
 "this announcement received a strong reaction across the state
" bhaajapa ke vaicharik janak rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne mukhyamantri se is elaan par amal nahin karne ke liye kaha
 a senior RSS pracharak, on the condition of not disclosing his name, said, "khandu may be hoping to get Christian votes in the next election, but the repeal of this law will be done by the original tribals of the state rather than Hindus There will be a much greater danger
 yah kanoon mukhya rup se rajya ke mul nivasee manyataon or dharm maanane vaale logon ke isiyat main andhadhundh dharmantaran ko rokane ke liye laayaa gaya tha
 "sangh pracharaks present census figures to support their argument

 The number of Christians in the state's population of 1
3 million is 30

 At the same time ten years ago (in 2001 census) he was just 18

 ise or acchhee tarah samajhane ke liye yah jaananaa dilachasp hoga ki 1981 main rajya ke 51
 6 per cent of the residents were followers of doni-polo and other local religions
 haalanki doni-polo kii taadaad main giravat chaunkaane vaali he, par kai jaankaron kaa kahana he ki mahange reeti-rivaajon kii vajah se iske maanane waalon ne yah dharm chhod diya
 But the RSS people take it further
 unke mutabik, ‚Äò‚Äò1951 main rajya main ek bhi isai nahin tha
 Khandu, who attended the program of Prem Bhai's death anniversary, spent 25 years in the state and was arrested and jailed several times under this law
 ‚Äô‚Äô odisha (1967) or madhya pradesh (1968) ke baad arunachal pradesh teesraa rajya tha jisane dharmantaran virdohi kanoon banaaya or lagu kiya tha
 Subsequently, Uttarakhand (2018), Chhattisgarh (2000), Gujarat (2003), Himachal Pradesh (2007) and Rajasthan (2008) also enacted anti-conversion laws and prohibited the conversion of religion by coercion or temptation
 isaayiyon ne khandu ke elaan kaa swaagat kiya he
 Arunachal Christian Forum leader Toko Takei feels that Khandu has realized the futility of this law and its administrative misuse
 ve kehete hai, ‚Äò‚Äòjab hindu mandir banaate hai tab unhen koi ijaajat lene kii jarurat nahin hoti
 But when we want to build a church, officers create many kinds of obstacles due to this useless law
 ‚Äô‚Äôhaalanki mulnivaasee dharm or manyataon ke kuch pramukh numaidon ne mukhyamantri ke elaan kii aalochana kii he
 He says that it is necessary to protect traditional faith practices and local cultures

 BJP insiders say that Khandu is doing so to help the Christians-dominated National People's Party (NPP) spread its legs

 The apex court told the Center during the hearing of the petitions filed against the decision of some states to make Aadhaar card mandatory for various activities like payment of salary and provident fund and registration of marriage and property, that the Aadhaar card was not issued to illegal immigrants Be done because it will legalize their stay
 bhartiya vishisht pahchaan praadhikaran or kendra sarkaar ke vakil ne kaha ki jahaan tak kendra sarkaar kaa sawaal he to ham pehle hi spasht kar chuke hai ki aadhaar card svaichhik he
 During a brief hearing on the matter, the bench of Justice BS Chauhan and Justice SA Bobde was told that despite the Aadhaar card being 'voluntary', the Registrar of the Bombay High Court, following an order of the state government, ordered that judges and employees It will be mandatory for the disbursement of salary

 (from input language) bal vivaah karne se manaa karne vaali jodhpur kii lakshmi kii kahani ab sibiesai ke course main padhai jaaegi
 At the age of 16, Lakshmi set a precedent for the fight against child marriage
 lakshmi ke isi jazbe ko salaam karte hue sibiesai ne unki kahani ko kitaab main shaamil karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Laxmi hails from Luni village in Jodhpur
 lakshmi ek saal kii bhi nahin thi ki uskaa vivaah apane se teen saal bade satlana gaanv ke rakesh ke saath kar diya gaya
 But twenty years later, with the help of an NGO, Lakshmi declared her child marriage legally invalid
 ek udhaaharan ke taur lakshmi kii cese study ko gyarahavin or barahavin class kii human raitus and gender studies main isi acedemic seshan se shaamil kiya he
 At the age of sixteen, when Lakshmi came to know about child marriage, she was very sad that she too was married in childhood
 tab se lakshmi ne khud ko avivaahit samajhnaa shuru kar diya
 Lakshmi did not give up and one day she approached Keerthi Bharti, psychologist of the NGO of Sarathi Trust and found out the necessary legal things related to child marriage
 isi bich lakshmi ko pataa chalaa ki akshay tritiya ko maukey par uskaa gauna hone vaala he
 Gauna is a ritual in which the bride has to go to her in-laws forever
 lakshmi ne kirti ko bataaya ki wo is shaadi se khush nahin thi
 He had told his parents about this, but he did not agree at all
 enjio kii cycolgist kirti bataati hai, 'maine counselling or kanoonee prakiya se gaune ko rukvane kii sochi, lekin lakshmi isse sahamat nahin thi
 Finally, Lakshmi contacted the judges and the lawyers and we came to know about the provision of the child marriage alliance
 kaaphi koshishon ke baad rakesh or lakshmi ne 24 april 2012 main ek afidavit sin kiya jisamen donon kii shaadi ko kanoonee rup se radd kiya gaya
 Psychologist Kirti of the NGO says that this is the first instance of its kind in which the couple married in marriage had their marriage canceled
 kanoonee safalataa ke baad mujhe pataa chalaa ki is cese ne history creat kii he
 Kirti counseled both the family, including Rakesh and inspired them to move on in life
 lakshmi kii cese study main gyarahavin class ke chepter-2 ke gender riledit ishu ke pej number 207 main liya gaya he
 Today Lakshmi is very happy in real life and she married Mahendra Sargara in January 2013 of her choice

 zakia jafari ke pati or purv saansad ehjan jafari un 68 logon main se ek the jinaki maut ahmedabad ke gulberga sosayadi main 2002 ke dangon ke dauraan hamale main hui thi

 The lower court had said in its judgment that the state government had completed all the necessary procedures during the riots and had taken every possible step to maintain the security system there
 tippaniyan The lower court also agreed with the SIT that Narendra Modi had taken all necessary steps in the shortest time to maintain law and order and handle the deteriorating situation there after the Godhra massacre
 hoicourt main is maamle kii sunwaayee lagbhag ek saal ke liye sthagit kar di gai thi, kyonki is cese ke baari-bharkam records kaa gujarati se hindi main anuwaad kiya janaa tha
 Zakia Jafri's husband and former MP Ehzan Jaffrey was one of the 68 people who died in an attack during the 2002 riots at the Gulbarga Society in Ahmedabad

 Dr
 Dhruv Prasad, director of Bihar's Department of Science Technology and in-charge of Muzaffarpur Institute of Technology (MIT), was arrested on Sunday night by a team of Bihar Monitoring Investigation Bureau taking a bribe of Rs 1
5 lakh
 beuro ke mahanideshak pi ke thakur ne somvaar ko bataaya ki prasad 'patna sahib group of college' ke vikaas adhikari charanjit singh se apane mujffarpur sthit awaas par ghoose lete pakade gaye
 Singh had sought permission to run the students' class in the evening shift at ITI
 is kaary ke liye bataur rishwat paanch lakh rupee kii maang kii gai thi or 50,000 rupee kii agrim raashi di ja chuki thi
 One and a half lakh rupees were being given as second installment
 maamle main dalal ke rup main kaary kar rahe ejeeniyar shashiranjan ko bhi giraftaar kiya gaya he
 At present, the officials of the surveillance department are questioning the arrested people
 bhagwaan to sarvashaktimaan hote hai, jinke aage kisi kii nahin chalati he
 But there were also occasions when God was forced to bow down
 unhen bhi haath jodakar kerani padi prarthana, tab jaakar unke jivan main khushiyaan lautin
 Everyone knows that the universe was created by the Supreme Father Brahma
 lekin kya aap yah jaanate hai ki ek baar brahma se bhi baari bhul ho gai thi
 a mistake that not only annoyed his wife, but also left her forever
 yahi nahin, patni ke gusse kaa hi yah parinaam tha ki aaj sristi kii rachana karne vaale kii puja sirf pushkar main hi hoti he
 Savitri sits on the top of distant mountains, Savitri, the ardhangini of the Supreme Father Brahma
 lekin yahaan savitri ruthi hui hai, naaraaz hai
 This is the reason why they have built their shelter on the mountain completely isolated from the temple of Brahma
 aap soch rahe honge ki savitri aakhir kis baat par brahma se naaraaz hai? kyon ve apane pati se alag mandir main virajati hai?is sawaal kaa jawaab chupa he pushkar ke mandir main
 This temple not only tells the story of increasing distance between Brahma and Savitri, but also seals the story of their relationship breaking up
 darasal, parampita brahma or savitri ke bich dooriyaan us vakt badhin, jab brahma ne sristi kii rachana ke liye pushkar main yajna kaa aayojan kiya
 The wife was required to sit in this yagya, but Savitri was delayed in reaching
 puja kaa shubh muhoort bitta ja rahaa tha
 All the gods and goddesses reached the sacrificial place one by one
 lekin savitri kaa koi ata-pataa nahin tha
 It is said that when the auspicious auspiciousness started coming, then seeing no solution, Brahma revealed Gayatri through the mouth of Nandini cow and married him and completed his yagna
 udhar savitri jab yagyasthali pahunchin, to vahaan brahma ke bagal main gayatri ko baithe dekh krodhit ho gayi or unhone brahma ko shraap de diya
 Savitri's anger did not calm down in this only
 unhone vivaah karaane vaale brahman ko bhi shraap diya ki chaahe jitna daan mili, brahman kabhi santusht nahin honge
 Cursed the cow to eat dirt in Kali Yuga and Narada to be a lifelong loner
 agnidev bhi savitri ke coup se batch nahin paae
 He too got the curse of being humiliated in Kali Yuga
 krodh shant hone ke baad savitri pushkar ke paas maujuud pahadiyon par jaakar tapasya main leen ho gayi or phir vahiin kii hokar rah gayi
 It is said that Savitri does welfare of devotees by staying here
 pushkar main jitani ahmiyat brahma kii he, utani hi savitri kii bhi he
 Savitri is considered the goddess of good fortune
 yah manyata he ki yahaan puja karne se suhaag kii lambii umr hoti he
 This is the reason why women come here and offer mehndi, bindi and bangles as prasad and ask Savitri for her husband's long life
