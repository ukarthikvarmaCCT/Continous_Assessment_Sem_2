 purv cricketer vivies lakshmana ne mahendra singh dhoni ko 'match vijeta' qaraar dete hue mangalvaar ko kaha ki yah wicketiper ballebaaj abhi do teen saal or test cricket khel saktaa tha
 Commenting on Dhoni retiring from the long-term format, Laxman told NDTV, "he is still the one-day captain and India will need him in the World Cup where the Indian team will play to defend the title
 
 lekin, meri nijee raay he ki vah abhi do teen saal or khel sakate the kyonki bharat ko agle saal gharelu sarajameen par kaaphi test khilne hai tathaa vah phir bharat ko sheersh par pahunchaa sakate the
 ' unhone kaha, 'duniya unhen aise captain ke rup main yaad karegi jinhone puure dabadabe ke saath captaini kii
 He is the match winner with the bat and has a particular style of wicketkeeping
 vah hameshaa yah sunishchit karnaa chahta tha ki dressing room kaa maahaul acha rahe
 ' purv bhartiya captain sunil gavaskar ne kaha ki dhoni kaa yogadan shabdon main bayaan nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 He said, 'what he achieved for Indian cricket is unmatched
 unke yogadan ko shabdon main bayaan nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 ' bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne beete roj elahabaad main (23 farvari) chauthe charan ke matdaan se pehle bijepi ke paksh main maahaul banane ke liye ilahabaad ke allahpur se berena or sulakhi chauraahaa se hokar ghantaghar tak road sho kiya
 Two days ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also rallied in Allahabad and adjoining districts to support 32 candidates of his and allies but now the question is that on the last day of campaigning after PM Narendra Modi's rally, BJP President Amit Shah got a road show Why had to do it
 uskaa ek kaaran he ki ilahabaad jile se pratapgarh, jonpur, bhadohi, kaushambi, mirzapur, sonbhadra, banda, chitrakoot jile lagate hai
 In such a situation, BJP is not in any mood to take any risk because today Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi also had a road show
 jaldbaaji main rakhaa gaya road shobijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne jaldbaazi main apana road sho isliye bhi rakhaa taaki piem modi kii raily se bane maahaul kii dhamak kamjor na ho
 The road show of Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi on him should not spoil the atmosphere created by Modi at the last minute
 bijepi ko bhi is baat kaa andeshaa he ki agar ilahabaad main party kii pakad kamjor padi to phir agle charnon main bhi party kaa maahaul kharaab hota chalaa jayega
 This is the reason why PM Modi and Amit Shah do not want to take even a small risk

 Chadha says, "india is in a state in which money has just arrived; Where people have a tendency to buy branded cars, watches and pens
 '' yah ubharate bazaaron ke liye saamaanya silsilaa he
 Luxury brands arrived in China in the 1990s and, in the case of India, one can say that this happened (with Louis Vuitton's first store opening in Delhi) in 2003

 The commission had given this order on separate complaints of BJP and Congress against the leader of Aam Aadmi Party
 Luka Chuppi Review:bollywood ne pichley kuch samay main kahaniyon ko lekar apana gear badla he, or karthik aryan (kartik Aaryan) tathaa kriti senon (kriti Sanon) kii 'luka chuphi (luka Chuppi)' isi kadi main ai film he
 The life, stereotypes and troubles and happiness of small town 'luka Chuppi' are included in themselves
 iske saath hi film kii puri team kii acting bhi kaaphi myne rakhti he, or in sab kasautiyon par 'luka chuphi (luka Chuppi)' niraash nahin karti he or darshakon ko manoranjan kii dose dene main koi kama nahin chhodti he
 On the acting front, Karthik Aryan continues to grow with every film
 chote shaharon kii bollywood main khulti khidakiyon kaa hi pratinidhitiv karti he 'luka chuphi (luka Chuppi)'
 In 'luka Chuppi', all the actors have done very well
 'luka chuphi (luka Chuppi)' kii kahani mathura ke guddu (karthik aryan) kii he jise rashmi (kriti senon) se pyaar ho jaataa he
 The young men of the small town living in Guddu talk about love, but open-minded Rashmi talks about live-in to try the relationship before marriage, then there is a twist in both of their lives
 rashmi ke pita tehre netaa or vah bhi liv-in ke dhur virdohi
 Guddu and Rashmi start living as husband and wife
 lekin ek din gharavaalon ko isaki bhanak lag jaati he, or phir shuru ho jaataa he great indian family drama
 In this way, the story of the film explores the small town mentality and the life there
 lekin kahani thodi khinchi hui he
 The acting and laughter of the actors in the film does not let the film get bored
 'luka chuphi (luka Chuppi)' ke sabhi actor acting ke morche par khare utre hai
 Karthik Aryan has played the character of Guddu very well and his excitement of marriage seems very fun
 vahiin, 'bareli kii barfi' main najar aa chukin kriti senon ne bhi ek bebaak ladki ke kirdaar ko bahut hi shandaar dhang se nibhaayaa he
 Vinay Pathak's hard-heartedness also seeps into the heart, and Pankaj Tripathi has once again been interesting to watch
 lekin abbaas ke kirdaar main aparshakti khurana par jaakar nazren tik jaati hai or unhen film main thodaa or zyada dekhne kaa man karata he
 Aparshakti is making a strong presence film-by-film
 'luka chuphi (luka Chuppi)' main diarection kii baat karen to lakshmana utekar ne acha kaam kiya he lekin film ko thodi kasaavat or kahani ko thodaa or dharre par rakhkar ve ise ek shandaar film bana sakate the
 The music of the film is not new as all the songs are old and have been recreated
 is tarah film mujeec ke maamle main kuch nayaa nahin detii he
 But there is no doubt that all the songs have been super hit
 phir moral pulising masale ko bhi film main dikhaaya gaya he
 In this way, 'luka Chuppi' is the soul of the small town with its one-time watch entertainer
 kovind ne kaha ki arunachal pradesh ne 'vividhta main ekta' ko pradarshit kiya he
 He praised the village heads of the state and the local judicial system 'kebang'

 AIMIM chief and MP from Hyderabad Asaduddin Owaisi asked the Home Ministry in the Lok Sabha questions related to the ban on Sanatan Sanstha
 is sawaal ke jawaab main ab grih mantralay ne jawaab diya he ki unke paas aisa koi prastaav nahin aayaa he
 Replying to the question of Asaduddin Owaisi on Tuesday, Minister of State for Home Kishan Reddy said that this case is related to Maharashtra ATS, so the state government can take a decision on it
 jahaan tak rahi centre kii baat to abhi tak aisa koi bhi prastaav centre sarkaar ko nahin diya gaya he
 Please tell that Sanatan Sanstha is the same organization whose members were arrested for the murder of Dr
 Narendra Dabholkar
 iske alaava maharashtra ke theatreon ke baahar hue bam dhamaakon se bhi inkaa naam judaa tha
 In Parliament, Asaduddin Owaisi had asked the question whether on the basis of the charge sheet of Maharashtra ATS, the government is considering banning Hinduist organization Sanatan Sanstha, Hindu Janggurthy
 agar haa, to abhi tak isaki kya detail hai
 Will the Indian government take steps to protect the country and shut down these organizations
 mangalvaar ko isi kaa jawaab diya gaya
 Minister of State for Home Kishan Reddy gave the answer in writing to the House
 jawaab main safataur par kaha gaya he ki ye maamla rajya kaa he, in par bain ko lekar koi prastaav centre ko nahin mila he
 Let us know that Narendra Dabholkar was murdered in 2013, on which CBI arrested Sanatan Sanstha member and ENT surgeon Virendra Singh Tawde, alleged shooter Sachin Andure and Sharad Kalskar

 During the hearing in the Delhi High Court, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Tushar Mehta said that in 2010, the first young Indian held only two share holders with 550 shares
 phir ise 100 rupee prati share ke dar se kharida gaya tha
 We got this information from Associated Journals Limited (AJL)
 share kaa market vailu bhi check kiya jaataa he
 But this was not done in this case
 tushaar mehtane kaha ki praathmik jaanch se inakam se judi jo jaankaree mili wo zyada thi
 Tushar Mehta said that if you look at the market value of the shares that you buy, then you get information about income
 is company main bhi niyam he ki jab bhi share bechaa yaa transfar kiya jaataa he tab audit market ke mutabik hota he
 At the same time, the price of the share bought at Rs 100 per share was higher
 unhone aage kaha ki property main interest yang india company kaa he
 90 crore was acquired by Young India, and it appears that the Young India Company did the take-over to AJL only to acquire the property
 iske baad yang india real state ke kaam karne laga jo ageel karata tha
 Justice S
 Ravindra Bhatt asked Netushar Mehta whether you wanted to say that the market value of the stock was higher when the share was allotted
 is par tushaar mehta ne jawaab diya ki bilkul, ham yahi kah rahe hai
 While p Chidambaram, appearing as an advocate for Sonia Gandhi, said that on 26 February 2012, Young India gave shares to the petitioner (sonia Rahul)
 ageel kya karata he, kisko check dete hai, isse mere client kaa kya lenaa-dena he? lekin inakam tex vibhaag kii taraf se pesh tushaar mehta ne kaha ki hamen sabase matlab he
 This is a case related to tax evasion

 co / g49lbinqzn Tension created in China and India is increasing continuously due to border problem
 china kii media ne saaf taur par dhamkee bhare shabd main likhaa he ki china kisi bhi tareeke ke takaraav ke liye taiyaar he, doklam ke mudde china yuddh ke liye jane se bhi peeche nahin hatega agar aisa hua to bharat ko is takaraav kaa bhugtan bhugatna pad saktaa he
 The article in China's official newspaper Global Times states that after 1962 India has been accused of inciting incitement
 isamen likhaa gaya he ki china ko bhavishya main hone vaale sabhi tarah ke takaraavon ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 China should go ahead and fight the confrontation on the LAC, if India is facing difficulties in many places then it will also have to face the confrontation on the LAC
 lekh main likhaa he ki china ko bejhijak docklam aria main nirmaan badhanaa chahie iske saath hi apni sena kii sankhya bhi vahaan par badhaani chahie
 As a sovereign country, it is the right of China
 china bharat ke saath kisi bhi tarah ke takaraav hone se nahin darataa he, isi prakaar china kisi bhi tarah ke yuddh se bhi nahin darataa he or khud ko iske liye taiyaar karata he
 Significantly, since the heightened tension since June 16, the Chinese media is continuously using such language
 haal hi main chini media kii ore se china kii sena kii golibari kii abhyaas karte hue video bhi jari kii gai thi
 The newspaper has written that such action in India is a challenge to the sovereignty of China, in a manner which is constantly increasing tension
 china ko takaraav ke liye bilkul taiyaar rahanaa chahie, haalanki iske saath hi samajhadaari kaa bhi upyog bhi karnaa chahie
 There is a continuous voice in China that the Indian Army should be removed from the Doklam sector, while the people of India also think that India is fighting for war with China
 in sabhi baton ko bhoolatey hue donon deshon ko sanyam rakhane kii zarurat he
 It has been written in the newspaper that diplomatic negotiations are still going on in both countries, but all kinds of relations have been poisoned by India
 agarbharat border par apni senaco majboot karata he to china bhi aisa hi karegaa
 If India wants to contest the numbers at the economic and military level, then China is ready for that
 china ek ubhartee hui takat he, vah kisi bhi tarah ke border samasya par apane strot kaa istemaal kar saktaa he
 China has built in the Tibet area which is near the borders of India, Bhutan and Nepal
 ye ek sena kii takat kii pratiyogita he iske saath hi iconomik grath kii bhi pratiyogita he

 ' narendra modi ne aakhirkaar 24 may ko chaiyn kii saans lee hogi kyonki us roj unke sabase kattar pratidwandvi sanjay joshi ne bhaajapa kii rashtriya kaaryakarini se istipha de diya
 Joshi's re-entry lasted months, after which Modi was adamant on getting him out of the party
 lekin jab unka daanv nahin chalaa or sangh kii ore se nitin gadakari ko phir se adhyaksh banane kaa faisla ho gaya, to modi ne bhi aakhri pasa phenk diya
 According to sources, Modi threatened to resign from the Executive and National Council if Joshi was not removed
 majabuuran gatirodh todane ko party kor group kii baithak or sangh se vichaar-vimarsh ke baad bich kaa rasta nikaala gaya
 In the process, Suresh Soni, the Sangh's co-government, played an important role and Gadkari himself interacted with Joshi, after which Modi was ensured in the national executive
 modi ne gadakari ko doosraa kaarykaal die jane ke samvidhan sanshodhan par bhi virodh jataa diya tha, lekin joshi ke istife kii evaj main ve sanshodhan ke liye sahamat ho gaye
 The incident is a major setback for the anti-modi faction within the Sangh, including Gadkari, who rejected the pleas of the Gujarat chief minister and brought Joshi to the party in August last year and commanded the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections
 is prakaran se gadakari or modi ke rishton main talkhi paidaa ho gai thi or naubat yahaan tak aa pahunchi ki donon netaaon ke bich aupchaarik aapasi samvaad bhi band ho gaya tha
 "I am a disciplined soldier of the organization, who has always learned to maintain true integrity and purposeful integrity above personal interest," Joshi wrote, poking that pain in his resignation to party president Gadkari
 usee parampara ke anuroop sanghathan main sahaj or sugam vyavastha sanchaalan hetu tathaa gatirodh samaapti ko sunishchit karne ke liye main rashtriya kaaryakarini kii aamantrit sadsyta se istife kii peshkash karata hum
 Joshi was dropped from the party in 2005 due to a sex CD
 sidi kaa khulaasa mumbai main hue party adhiveshan ke vakt hua tha or is baar bhi mumbai unke liye bhaagyashaalee sabit nahin hui
 However, a senior party leader says, "joshi's resignation will only temporarily serve as a ceasefire as he has only resigned from the national executive, not from the party and the anti-modi faction within the Sangh Parivar completely expelled him from the party
" May resist going
 '' sangh-bhaajapa ne bhi maukey kii najaakat ko dekh modi ke aage ghutane teke hai
 Says a senior Sangh leader, "A defeat in the Gujarat elections will be a defeat of the Sangh ideology
 isliye philhal na chaahate hue bhi kathor faisla lenaa padaa he
 On Joshi's return to BJP, Modi pulled out a sword
 ranneetik taur par unhone sabase pehle sangh ke ek nichle padaadhikari ke jariye sangh ke hi varisht netaaon tak apni shikaayat darj karai or phir gadakari or unke samarthakon ke phone uthaane band kar die
 The first rift between Gadkari and Modi on Joshi's issue was seen when Gadkari did not reach Ahmedabad in September at Modi's goodwill program
 us kaarykram main bhaajapa kaa takreeban samoochaa netritv gujarat kii rajdhani pahunchaa tha or rajg ke bhi netaa aae the
 At that time, Gadkari did not join him by talking about his weight loss surgery in Mumbai
 iske baad modi ne bhi palatwaar kiya
 He used Navratri's fast as an excuse to refuse to go to bjp's national executive in October
 lekin modi ko jaanane vaale rajya bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa ke mutabik, ''modi apni badi hissedari ke liye khelte hai or iskaa aadhaar majboot rakhte hai kyonki ve jaanate hai ki lambii daud main iske nattejey achche aaenge
 This strategy worked in the Joshi episode
 '' baharhaal, modi ne joshi virdohi apane paksh ko kaise majboot kiya, isaki kahani badi dilachasp he
 Through an intermediary, Modi first sent a strong message to the Sangh and then to the BJP leadership that not only is Joshi's sex CD correct, but he also knows well how some senior party leaders 'fake certificates' from the Forensic Laboratory to save Joshi
 Brought the jugaad, in which the CD was described as fake
 unke madhyasth ne kathith taur par modi kii ore se sangh or bhaajapa netaaon se sawaal kiyah ''agar modi aise kisi sidi cond main pakade gaye hote to kya aap log unhen baksh dete? kya sangh or bhaajapa netritv ko sangh parivaar main sabhi ke liye ek samaan maapdand kaa prayog nahin karnaa chahie?'' sangh or bhaajapa ko modi kii ore se aghoshit sankawt bilkul saaf tha, ''kya aap joshi ko isliye bachaane kii koshish kar rahe hai kyonki ve gadakari or sangh ke anya netaaon kii tarah vidarbha ke hai?''sangh ke kuch netaa modi kii is daleel se sahamat the ki alag-alag logon ke liye alag-alag maapdand nahin ho sakate
 By the way, the response to Modi's strong message came even harder from the anti-modi faction within the Sangh, including M
 ji
 Vaidya, Manmohan Vaidya, Madhubhai Kulkarni and VHP supremo Drs
 praveen togadiya shaamil hai
 The anti-modi group allegedly alleged that the CD was a fake and it was a conspiracy to end Joshi's political future and only to send a harsh message to such "criminals" that Joshi was completely lost in his place Will have to be brought back
 haalanki modi lagaataar sidi cond main apni bhoomika ko nakaarte rahe or yahi saboot dene main lage rahe ki sidi nakli nahin thi
 Modi got another chance to strengthen his position when the BJP lost its face in Uttar Pradesh
 isse na sirf joshi balki gadakari kii kshamta par bhi sawaal khadaa hua
 However, due to Modi not going in the campaign, the argument of defeat in Uttar Pradesh does not embrace many leaders
 unka maananaa he ki modi to punjab, goa or uttarakhand main bhi prachaar karne nahin gaye
 The question is also arising that Joshi was the reason in Uttar Pradesh, so why did Modi not go to other states? However, Manmarji created an atmosphere against Gadkari in distributing tickets for Rajya Sabha after the defeat of Uttar Pradesh
 gadakari kii kaaryastylee par adwani or sushamaa swaraj ne aapatti jataai
 But in this entire controversy, Arun Jaitley's role as the third party in avoiding the crisis was important
 jetali ko gadakari or modi donon kaa kareebi mana jaataa he or unhone hi joshi ke masale par baar-baar gadakari ko kathith taur par raji kiya
 modi-joshi's rivalry is not new, it started in the mid-nineties when Joshi was brought under training under Modi
 us vakt modi gujarat bhaajapa ke sanghathan sachiv the
 If Modi's supporters are to be believed, Joshi was shocked by the alleged duplicity of Joshi, who used to remain directly in front of Modi but behind the back complained to some big leaders of the Sangh
 udhar, joshi ke samarthak thik yahi aarope modi par lagaate hai
 However, the solution to this crisis has brought great relief for the BJP
 gadakari-modi ke bich pichley kareeb aath maheene se baat tak nahin hui thi
 Clearly, this crisis was in front of Pararty, which required an immediate stop

 Talking about the actor's workfront, his previous release Zero was aired at the box office
 iske baad actor ke production tale film badla relies hui
 In which Amitabh Bachchan and Taapsee appeared in the foil lead role
 movie badla tikat khidki par shandaar kamai kar rahi he
 The film 'kamal Dhamaal Malamal' is the sequel to Malamal Weekly
 
 
 haalanki kahani nai he lekin film main kaam karne vaale zyaadaatar kalakaar puraane hai
 Om Puri's son Ritesh Deshmukh has been replaced by Shreyas Talpade and heroine Madhurima's addition is Nana Patekar's new entry
 'maalamaal vikali' main lottery ke paison ke liye puraa gaanv daud rahaa tha jabaki 'kamaal dhamal maalamaal' main sirf shreyas talapade lottery ke zariye karodpati banane kaa sapana dekh rahe hai
 They are absolutely useless and also Dorpok who keeps on beating the children of the village
 apni mahabuuba ke bhaaiyon se pitnaa isaki aadat he isliye gaanv ke log shreyas ko 'bakrii' ke naam se bulaate he
 Meanwhile, there is an entry of Nana Patekar who is a strongman, so Shreyas presents him to everyone before making him his lost elder brother
 tippaniyan Whenever Nana Patekar opens his mouth, he opens it only for food, that is, there is no dialogue in Nana's film, just a lot of food
 dialog na hote hue bhi naanaa ke achche expressant hai
 Shreyas has done well and has got good support from all the actors
 kuch seens achche hai jo aapako koob hansaaenge
 But, this is not the best cinema of director Priyadarshan
 sangeet kaa koi role nahin
 The film caught on in the first half but the second half weakened a bit
 film ko ek baar dekh sakate hai lekin zyada ummiido ke saath nahin
 My rating for the film is 2
 5 star
 In 'malamal Weekly' the entire village was running for lottery money while in 'kamal Dhamaal Malamal' only Shreyas Talpade is dreaming of becoming a millionaire through lottery
 bilkul nikamme hai or darpok bhi jo gaanv ke bacchon se bhi maar khaataa rahata he
 It is a habit to beat up your Mehbooba brothers, so the villagers call Shreyas by the name of 'goat'
 isi bich, naanaa patekar kii entry hoti he jo taaqatvar he isliye use shreyas apana khoyaa hua bada bhai banaakar sabake saamne pesh karata he
 The comments naanaa patekar jab bhi munh kholte hai vah khaane ke liye hi kholte hai yani naanaa ke film main dialog nahin hai bas dher sara khaanaa he
 Despite the dialogue, Nana has good expressions
 shreyas ne acha abhinay kiya he or tamaam kalakaaron kaa acha saport mila he
 Some scenes are good which will make you laugh a lot
 lekin, diarector priyadarshan kaa yah best cinema nahin he
 No music roll
 first haaf main film ne pakad banaai he lekin second haaf thodi kamazor pad gai
 You can watch the film once but not with high expectations
 film ke liye meri reating he 2
 5 stars

 america ne kaha he ki vah kashmir par tab tak madhyasthata nahin karegaa jab tak bharat is tarah kii peshkash ko manjuur nahin karata
 The US also asked Pakistan to refrain from using terrorism as a tool of government policy
 afghanistan evam pakistan ke liye america ke vishesh pratinidhi james dobins ne pakistan ke sarkari tivi channel pakistani televijan (pitivi) se kaha, jab tak bharat kisi tarah kii vaastavik madhyasthata ko manjuur nahin karata ham vishesh rup se ise lekar zyada kuch nahin kar sakate
 Dobins, who recently visited Pakistan, said India has been consistently rejecting the mediation of any third party and said that there is a need for direct dialogue on the issue (kashmir) without any third party stake
 isliye unhone madhyasthata ko khaarij kiya he
 Dobins said, "I think as long as he continues to reject arbitration, the US or some other party will be able to do something to a limit
" ham nishchit rup se pakistan or bharat ke saath apni baatcheet main behatar sambandhon, behatar vyapaarik sambandhon, ranneetik evam sainya muddon par behatar baatcheet ko badhaava dete hai
 At the same time, they also promote dialogue and discussion on regional issues that separate the two countries
 kashmir main lagu anuchhed 370 or 35A vivaadon main he, isi bich soshal media par ek post viral ho rahaa he
 It is being claimed that if a woman from Jammu and Kashmir marries a person from another state in India, then that woman's citizenship will end
 vahiin agar vah pakistan ke kisi vyakti se shaadi karti he to us vyakti ko bhi jammu-kashmir kii naagarikta mil jaaegi

 maamle kii tah tak jane ke liye hamane jammu-kashmir kii naagarikta or adhikaron kii baat karne vaale artical 35A ke bare main internet par search kiya
 We found a news article from Firstpost
 is artical main rajya ke sarkari vakil ishaak kadri ke hawaale se likhaa gaya he ki oktober 2002 main jammu-kashmir hai court ne state and adars varses dow
 While ruling in the case of Sushila Sahane & Others, the provision of Permanent Resident Law of the state was repealed, according to which the status of the permanent resident's daughter being a permanent resident of Jammu and Kashmir after marrying a person from another state used to go
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki kisi bhi bahari vyakti se shaadi karne ke baad bhi jammu-kashmir kii mahila vahaan kii sthaayee nivasee hi rahegi or sampatti par adhikaar sahit sabhi adhikaar uske paas rahenge
 This order of the High Court was challenged in the Supreme Court by the pdp-congress coalition government, but later withdrew the petition
 iske alaavaartical 35ake anusaar agar koi kashmiri ladki kisi bahari ladke se shaadi karti he to us purush ko kashmir kii naagarikta yaa anya adhikaar nahin milte
 The outsider can be from another state or any country
 nahin kharid sakate jameenartical 370 ke tahat jammu-kashmir ko vishesh rajya kaa darja mila hua he, jiske chalate rajya ke kuch vishesh adhikaar bhi hai
 Therefore, anyone who is not a resident of Jammu and Kashmir cannot buy land here
 aisa niyam himachal pradesh, arunachal pradesh, nagaland jaise kuch anya rajyon main bhi lagu he
 In the manifesto of the BJP also before the Zikralok Sabha elections 2019, the BJP had reiterated the need to remove Article 370 in its resolution letter
 vahiin apane ghoshanpatr main dhara 35e ko jammu-kashmir ke gaiyr sthaayee nivaasiyon or mahilaon ke khilaaf bhedbhaavpurn bataate hue ise khatm karne kii bhi baat kahi thi
 However, no legal action has been taken so far

 Second, in Pathankot, we called the ISI for investigation, while their own terrorists attacked the airbase

 ? In the first one year of the government, the absence of any major corruption case is just a matter of relief and not a festival
 grand karpshan sarkaron ke pehle saal main nahin upajataa
 Dozens of examples, from the UPA government at the center to the states, propose that old governments move closer to the threat of corruption
 upie ke ghotaale to uske duusare kaarykaal ke antim varshon main nikle the
 There should be more concern that the Narendra Modi government has spent the entire year without creating or strengthening the necessary institutions which are necessary for the clean functioning in the complex system of a large country
 modi ne pehle saal main na to sarkari tantra par nigaah rakhane vaali sanvaidhanik sansthaaon ko takat di or na hi niamak sudhaaron kii sud lee
 Corporate entities are the security circle of governments and independent regulators of the open market
 is suraksha chakra kii namaujuudagi ke kaaran paardarshita ke maamle main modi sarkaar ke jokhim badaae lage hai
 The government's dilemma in the government begins to reflect on a deep examination of the decisions and methods of taking them over the past year
 baat keval kendriya satarkta ayukta yaa kendriya soochna ayuktaon kii ek saal se lambit niyukti kii hi nahin he jise lekar vipaksh ke tewaron ke baad beete saptaah pradhanmantri ne pehali baar baithak kii
 The reality is that from the establishment of Lokpal to the formation of regulators in various fields, the government could not move even an inch in the last year
 uhapoh kendrikrut banaam vikendrit gavarnence ke bich chunaav kii he
 Modi has been opting for centralization of power, with barely any space for institutions like the Lokpal or Vigilance Commission or independent economic regulators
 jabaki aarthik sudhaaron ke baad bharat main gavarnence kaa jo model viksit hua, usamen sarkaar or bazaar par nigaah rakhane vaali swytt sansthaaon kii takat badi he
 Regulators have handled the open market as far as telecommunications, electricity insurance and financial services are concerned, while constitutional bodies like the Supreme Court and the CAG have monitored the governments
 is nai vyavastha se adhikaron main takaraav, faislon main deree jaisi ulajhanein jarur paidaa hui hai lekin ek vishaal desh ke bhimkaay bazaar or manamaane rajnatik tantra ko sanbhaalane main inaki upyogita sabit bhi hui he
 The Modi government in its first one year could not form a solid opinion on this changed structure of governance which has not only created an ad-hocism, but the drive to reduce the powers of the Reserve Bank has shown that the government is not comfortable with independent regulators Huh
 adarsh taur par koyala khadaanon ke punahavanton kii prakriya ek swatantra niamak ko tay kerani chahie thi
 If the allocation was early, the coal regulator should have been formed immediately thereafter so that the government's interference in deciding the quality of coal, resolving the disputes of companies, monitoring mining and fixing the price of coal would have been less
 khadaanon kaa aavanton to ho gaya lekin niamak na hone ke kaaran koyala kshetra main apaardarshita va tadarthwaad jas kaa tas he
 Why did foreign investment in railways not go up? The task of framing rules for the railways will have to be given to an independent regulator so that there can be equal competition in the market
 railway main sudhaar ke liye bibek debaray samiti modi sarkaar ne hi banaai thi lekin jab samiti ne regulator banane kii sifarish kii to sarkaar sust pad gai
 There has also been no activism in making regulators in aviation, financial services and real estate
 modi ko apane pehle hi saal main lokapal ke gathan kii pahal kerani chahie thi
 But here in a year, the chairman of the Central Vigilance Commission could not be selected
 modi ke liye paardarshita ko lekar apane sankalp ko sabit karne kaa yah sabase acha mauka he, kyonki bijepi shuru se sarkari tantra ke liye lokapal jaise taqatvar niamak ke paksh main rahi he
 Government officials are being empowered with new powers through laws such as black money, the formation and strengthening of constitutional institutions to monitor this power will actually make the government's voice more clear about transparency
 modi kaa gavarnence model rajyon ke liye nazeer ban rahaa he
 As the centralization of power in the Prime Minister's Office has increased in the last twelve months, the Chief Minister's offices in the states have also delegated powers on the same lines
 centre main to kam-se-kam sieji, supreme court or duusari sakriy agenciyaan hai jo gavarnence kii nigahabaani kar sakati hai, rajyon main na to satarkta kaa dhaancha he or na hi adaalaton ke paas nigahabaani kaa anubhav he
 Regulatory reforms have not even started in the states, while the next major events of privatization and government spending are to be held in the states
 nigahabaani va niyaman karne vaali sansthaaen sarkaar ke adhikaron main hissaa bantaati hai jo koi siyaasi netaa aasaani se dena nahin chahta
 Narendra Modi may have limited the power of the Lokayukta as the Chief Minister of Gujarat or did not pay much attention to creating an independent regulator, but as Prime Minister, he should not delay in making Lokpal, strengthening the vigilance framework and regulatory reforms
 sarkaar ko ek saal main yah ehsaas ho gaya he ki achche din laana jaadu nahin he, thik isi tarah khule bazaar main ek saaf-suthri sarkaar chalaanaa bhi jaadu nahin he
 Transparent leadership is not a guarantee of cleanliness of the entire system
 is sarkaar main sabhi faisle pradhanmantri kendrit hai isliye agar sarkaar paardarshita ke morche par phisalati he to khamiyaaje bhi pradhanmantri ke khate main hi darj honge
 Modi can limit this risk only by creating a security cycle of strong and powerful regulatory-watchdog institutions
 kya ve aisa kar paaenge? The Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKSA) has removed former chief minister and National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah from the post of president through voting
 35 saal baad hate abdullakshmir gymkhana club ke manjuur vajeer ke mutabik rajya cricket sangh se jude 64 cricket klbon main se 42 ne aantarik matdaan main hissaa liya
 Wazir said that state sports minister Imran Raja Ansari has been elected the new president of JKSA
 mehboob ikbaal ko nayaa chairman, mohammad ikbaal ko mahasachiv or abdul rauf ko koshadhyaksh banaaya gaya he
 Let me tell you that this is the first time since Abdullah lost his control over JKSA after being elected as the head of the State Cricket Association for the first time in 1980

 While SP BSP alliance Ram Bhuvan Nishad is in the fray, Congress has given ticket to Madhusudan Tripathi, who is a Brahmin by caste
 gorakhpur main saadhe teen lakh nishad matadaata hai to 3 lakh brahman
 In this way, the Congress has made it difficult for the BJP by taking the Brahmin candidate because Madhusudan Tripathi is a local, a lawyer by profession and is popular in his caste
 magar yah bijepi kaa garh rahaa he
 At present, the BJP has control over all the five assembly seats here
 18 saalon se bijepi hi jitati ai he
 In 2014, Yogi Adityanath got around 52 percent of the votes while the SP-BSP got 38 percent
 upachunaav main yogi apana man pasand ummidavaar na die jane se naaraaz bataae ja rahe the
 As a result, BJP lost this seat, Praveen Kumar Nishad won the election
 is baar hua yah he ki praveen kumaar bijepi main shaamil ho gaye hai or bijepi ne unhen gorakhpur se tikat na dekar sant kabir nagar se tikat diya he
 While the alliance has fielded Rambhual Nishad and it is believed that he has the support of about 80 per cent Nishad
 yahi vajah he ki ravi kishan ke liye mushkilen badhati ja rahi hai
 Despite his Bhojpuri stardom, the matter in Gorakhpur is not settling because apart from the Nishad votes, the alliance has Muslim, Yadav and Dalit votes which stand firmly with them
 saath hi congress ne brahman vot main send lagaakar bijepi kii haalat or kharaab kar di he
 This is the reason that the seat of Gorakhpur has become a seat of prestige for Chief Minister Yogi along with Chief Minister Yogi

 The BJP is being opposed to the victory procession being taken out from place to place

 shuukravaar ko bardwan ke rathtala main kai bijepi kaaryakartaaon ke gharon par jai bangala ke naam se maovadiyon ke style main poster chipkaae gaye hai
 This poster even threatened to kill in the event of joining the procession or planting a flag
 bijepi ne tiemasi kaaryakartaaon par ye poster lagane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Burdwan BJP Municipal Committee member Prashant Rai said that on the last 4th date he had taken permission for the Vijay procession, but suddenly on Thursday night he was informed by the administration that the victory procession could not be organized
 prashanth raay ne kaha ki unke ghar ke saath hi kai anya bijepi kaaryakartaaon ke ghar par jai bangala ke naam se maovadiyon ke style main poster chipkaae gaye hai, jisamen juluus main shaamil hone athwa jhanda lagane kii sthiti main hatya karne tak kii dhamkee di gai he
 We have lodged a complaint at Burdwan police station
 in sab ke peeche tiemasi ke kaaryakartao kaa haath he
 We will also agitate about this
 tiemasi ke bardwan ke general secretary khoken das ne aarope ko jhootha bataate hue kaha ki bijepi ke kaaryakartaaon ne hi ye poster lagaae he
 Let me tell you, a few days ago two TMC cadres were killed in Bengal
 tiemasi ne is hatya kaa aarope bijepi netaaon par lagaaya tha

 lekin kya raashtra kii seva main pehle se lagi koi cheez raashtra ke naam phir samarpit kii ja sakati he? It is not hidden from anyone that INS Vikramaditya has been inducted in the Navy only last year and for that the then Defense Minister AK Antony went to Russia
 sena main kamishan kaa matlab hota he ki aap raashtra kii seva main hai
 Moreover, the Navy itself informed via mail last month that INS Vikramaditya has become operational
 to phir se yah kaise raashtra ko samarpit ho saktaa he? yah to pehle se hi raashtra kii seva main he− agar nahin hota, to phir ienes yani indian neval ship or vikramaditya kaise miltaa? There is no doubt that Prime Minister Modi's visit to Vikramaditya is a big thing not only for the Navy but for the whole country
 puri duniya ko ek sandesh gaya ki modi ke liye sena kitna myne rakhata he
 But was the Prime Minister not informed that Vikramaditya has become the property of the nation, which cannot be handed over to the nation again

 Station in-charge Ramsingh Rathore said that the mobile phone of the son of Gunlal Baria, a resident of Narsinghpada village, was lost
 use iskaa pataa chalaa, to usne apane bete ke saathiyon par shaq kiya
 He told the son's friends that one of them had taken his mobile phone
 iske liye vah unki khaas tareeke se jaanch karegaa
 He told that he heats oil in a pot and everyone hands it
 yadi unhone mobile phone nahin liya hoga, to unka haath nahin jalegaa
 After this, Baria heated oil in the pot late Monday evening and got the children to shake hands
 isse 15 varshiya bablu, 12 varshiya dathrath or 9 varshiya sonu ke haath buree tarah jhulas gaye

 After all, why did the government not conduct an investigation

 Sanjay Singh asserted that "there is complete opposition with the Army statement
" sena ne kaha ki jo hamaara target tha hamane usko hit kiya
 But Yogi Adityanath said 400 militants were killed, Amit Shah said that two hundred and fifty terrorists were killed
 aahluwalia ne kaha ek bhi nahin maaraa gaya
 So who gave the statement of credentials
 singh ne kaha ki ''aaj koun sena kii karrwai par sawaal uthaa rahaa he
 Bharatiya Janata Party leaders are questioning the army's action
 unase poocha janaa chahie vah kyon sena ko badnaam kar rahe
 Why are the army politicized? sena ne jo kaha he uskaa sammaan kiijie kyon dhai sau, 300 kah rahe hai clerity aap dene vaale koun hote hai
 Who bothered to comment on the Army's statement, did the BJP leaders expel the leaders from the party, Yogi says 400 terrorists have been killed, Amit Shah Kete has 250 killed, Ahluwalia says what it has not been killed

 He is also being trolled in social media for this statement

 menon ne kaha ki aisi sthiti main parmaanu yuddh kii ashanka bad jaati he, kyonki bharat iskaa jawaab vyapak parmaanu hathiyaaron se degaa
 National Security Advisor Menon said India's nuclear weapons are not meant to discourage Pakistani terrorists

 " purv videsh sachiv ne kaha ki bharat kii pakistan niti ko hameshaa vaastaviktaa ke sandarbh main nahin dekha gaya
 Talking about the 26 / 11 Mumbai attack, Menon said that he had asked for a befitting reply against the terrorist camps or ISI at that time in lashkar-e-taiba or Pakistan-occupied Kashmir

 Menon called the surgical strike on September 28 in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir by the Indian Army mandatory after the terrorist attack in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha, "bharat ko nirnaayak sainya samaadhaan ke bina lambey vakt tak seemaa paar se aatankwaad ko rokane ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie

 bollywood star ajay devgan ne ek audio tepe twitor par jari kar is baat kaa khulaaya kiya he ki filmmekar karan johar ne apni film 'e dil he mushkil' ke bare main achche rivyuu dene ke liye keaarke ko 25 lakh rupee die hai
 Sharing this audio clip on Twitter, Ajay Devgan has tweeted, 'here's what you are saying, self proclaimed No
1 Critic and film trade analyst Kamal r Khan
 'hear what self proclaimed no
 1 critic and trade analyst Kamaal r Khan has to say
 https: / / t
 co / wrc7moslsz — Ajay Devgn (@ajaydevgn) September 1, 2016 This audio clip is really surprising
 is phone recording main ajay devgan ke manager or bijness partner kumaar mangat pathak or keaaren kii baatcheet shaamil he
 In this phone call made by Ajay Devgan to KRK through his manager, when he is asking KRK, why did he tweet against 'shivaay' and Karan Johar's film 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil'? So, while looking at this question, he is shying away from answering the question and saying that he did not do anything like this
 keaarke kah rahe hai ki unhen to karan johar kii film ke bare main bolnaa hi padegaa kyonki iske liye karan ne unhen 25 lakh rupee jo die hai
 Only Youngsters watch films 2-3 times and they like Ranbir kapoor, @ anushkasharman Fawwad so they are going to watch # adhmnot # Shivaay! - KRK (@kamaalrkhan) August 30, 2016 @ kamaalrkhanbudget is 125 & 70cr already cover ho chuke h
 Tere source tujhe 150 budget bol ke chutiya bana rhe h
 - The Destroyer (@ajaydevgntweets) August 30, 2016 However, in his next tweet, KRK wrote that Karan Johar did not give him any 25 lakh rupees, but on the phone he said this to ignore Ajay's manager
 keaarke ne twit main yah bhi kaha ki ajay or unke manager kumaar ne unhen 'shivaay' kii publicity ke liye rupee bhi ofer kiye lekin unhone kaha ki vah unke liye yah kaam free main hi kar denge
 Let me clear it
 Karan Johar has never paid me or asked me to bash # Shivaayn you can hear it in the tape
 i said 25 Lakhs to avoid Kumar
 — KRK (@kamaalrkhan)september 1, 2016kumar+ajay offered me money to bash # aedilhaimushkilas he is offering in the tape also but i refused
 i told them that i will do it free
 — KRK (@kamaalrkhan)september 1, 2016ajay devgan ne ek aadhikarik bayaan jari karte hue is maamle kii jaanch karne kii maang kii he
 Ajay Devgan said, 'I have been a part of this film industry for the last 25 years and have been associated with more than 100 films
 mere pita ek prafational ection diarector rahe hai or is industry ke saath meraa ek imotional conection he
 That is why it is sad to see people like Kamal r Khan who are spreading their negativity towards films by making money in the industry, earning money from producers
 yah behad dukh kii baat he ki hamaari industry ke log bhi is tarah kii chizon ko saport kar film industry ke maahaul ko kharaab kar rahe hai
 i demand that if Karan Johar is involved in this case then such a case should be thoroughly investigated
 'philhal is puure maamle par karan johar kii ore se koi twit yaa bayaan jari nahin kiya gaya he

 ayodhya faisle par muslimon main vyaapt gusse or asantosh kaa asar dikhegaa bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon par
 The Muslims in Bihar currently undergoing assembly elections — like others in the community across the country — are equally angry and sad, and the reason for this is the High Court's decision on the Ayodhya matter
 lekin dusron ke ulat, rajya ke muslimon ke paas andar hi andar ghutane kii jagah apana rosh prakat karne kaa mauka maujuud he, or yah mauka juta rahaa he vidhansabha chunaav
 There are clear indications that Muslims will forget their apathy and remove their anger on election day
 lekin, koun-si party yaa gathbandhan sabase zyada nuksaan main rahegaa? kya yah laalkrishna adwani kii bhaajapa ke saath team bana rahe nitish kumaar kii jad (you) hogi? yaa phir congress ko apni ''aitihaasik galatiyon'' ke alaava faisle kaa swaagat karne ke chalate iskaa khamiyaja bhugatna padegaa- haalanki faisle se pehle kai log maan rahe the ki muslim congress kii ore laut rahe hai
 There is also a considerable number of such Muslims, who seem to be doing the right thing while avoiding controversies
 lekin, jab baat chunavi vishleshan kii aati he to ve khari-khari kehane main vishwaas rakhte hai
 Shamim Ansari, a teacher working on the contract, talks about the implications
 bihar ke aurangabad jile ke 37 varshiya ansaari prashn poochne ke andaaj main kehete hai, ''jab supreme court ne sarkaar se garibon main muft main anaaj vitarit karne ke liye kaha tha, to pradhanmantri ne use niti nirdhaaran main hastkshep na karne kii salaah di thi
 But when the Allahabad High Court gave a decision that was confusing and 'satisfying' to everyone, the Congress welcomed it and it wants us to accept this and accept it further
 kya ye dohare maandand nahin hai?''ansaari jor dete hai ki elahabaad hycourt ke faisle ke congress dwaara anumodan par unka rukh, unke hi nahin balki puure samudaay ke soch kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 "it will have an effect," he says
 mere liye, jad (you) ke bhaajapa ke saath gathbandhan ke sandarbh main lalu prasad yadav badi jeet ke asal hakdaar hai
 But this loss of Congress may benefit other political parties
 ''haalanki manmohan singh sarkaar is masale ke saath ba't hi saavdhaanee ke saath pesh ai he or ayodhya maamle par court ke faisle ke kriyanvayan se kanni katati dikhi, faisla jo kahata he or ise lekar congress kii sweekaaryata chunavi bihar main bahut myne rakhti he, jahaan-bihar ke aarthik surveykshan 2009-10 ke mutabik-rajya kii kul jansankhya kaa muslim hissaa 16

 kaha ja saktaa he ki bihar kii 243 vidhansabha siton main se 60 par muslim vot chunavi drushti se mahatvapurn hai or arriya (41
 14%), Purnia (36
 76 %), katihaar (42
 53%) and Kishanganj (67
 58 %) jilon main 24 siton par nirnaayak hai
 On the other 50 seats in the state, there is a change of opinion
 yahi nahin, musalamaanon kaa jo taaja rujhaan dekhne ko mil rahaa he, uskaa andaja ayodhya faisle se pehle kadaapi nahin lagaaya gaya tha
 Before the High Court verdict, all the speculations were being made to support the Muslims in the face of the Congress, one of the reasons being considered by the BJP to unify its main voters
 lekin jaise hi faisla aayaa, bhaajapa ne ummiido ke vipareet faisle par ekadam chuppi banaae rakhi, sambhawatah aisa nitish kumaar ke dabaav ke chalate bhi ho saktaa he
 The frustration of Muslims over the decision in Bihar that is blowing in the electoral winds can also turn into an anti-congress wave
 haalanki congress is mudde se puri tarah waakif lagati he
 The party has fielded 49 Muslim candidates and this is the highest number of Muslim candidates fielded by any party
 iske peeche party kii yah ummid ho sakati he ki ve muslimon kaa congress se mohabhang nahin hone denge
 But, it is too early to say that the Congress has reduced the minority vibe to a large extent by bringing in a large number of Muslim candidates
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki muslim dharmik prishthbhumi ke aadhaar par bhi vot daalate hai, congress yah kalpana kar sakati he ki uske hisse main kaaphi kuch aa jayega
 Naturally, the party is hoping that the Muslim candidates of the Congress will be able to attract the people of their community on a micro level
 patna main muslimon ke pratishthit saamaajik-dharmik sanghathan imaarat sharia ke dipti secretary mufti mohammad sanoul houdah kaasmi muslimon ke dard ko bayaan karte hai lekin jor dekar kehete hai ki yah akele congress ko nishaanaa nahin banaata he
 He says, "we respect the decision, but it does not mean that we accept it either
" congressiyon kii tarah har koi apane vichaar rakhane ke liye aaazaad he
 However, there is not much awareness about the issue of who is saying what
 muslim congressiyon ke paksh main yaa unke khilaaf vot kar sakate hai
 However, the Congress has been openly supportive of the decision, due to which more than 10% Muslims are likely to be affected
 isse zyada nahin
 "kasmi also believes that Muslim youth are seen to be more upset than other communities
" ve kehete hai, ''aisa isliye he kyonki yah ek vichaarsheel or jaagruk peedi he
 In addition, Muslim factions can also vote on religious grounds
 ''patna haj bhawan main college chaatr naseem siddiki ko apni hataasha jaahir karne ke liye shabd hi nahin milte hai
 He says, "the decision has not only defeated the Muslims but has also put a big question mark on the secularism of India
" '' hajipur kaa rahane vaala yah 22 varshiya yuva jo apane khaali samay main haj yatriyon kii seva kaa kaam karata he, netaaon ke girggit kii tarah rang badalane ke andaaj se puri tarah khinn he
 He said very clearly, "I will not vote
 isse hoga bhi kya? yahi nahin, hamaara 150 muslim yuvaaon kaa samooh satta ke lobhi netaaon ko vot daalane ke badale is baar chunaavon kaa bahishkaar karegaa
 "his voice calms down but a sense of uneasiness is evident on his face
" edwartiging or marketing main piji diploma liye naukari kii talash kar raheen 21 varshiya kehkashan kuraishi ''aage badhane'' ke liye kahati hai
 Though Kahkansh does not feel good about the Ayodhya verdict, she insists that it is time to focus on the real issues
 ve kahati hai, ''main naukari kii talash main hum
 Employment is my first concern
 mahangaai, arthvyavastha, swasthya, shiksha mukhya masale hai
 Both communities have enough places for worship
 '' kehkashan asal tathyon se anjaan nahin hai or ve apni raay jaahir karne ke liye vot dengi
 He says, "of course, the Congress is largely responsible for this state of the community — both symbolic and real
" nijee taur par main lalu prasad kii jagah nitish kumaar ko chunanaa pasand karuungi kyonki maine un andhakaarmay dinonke bare main sun rakhaa he
 These voices, supported by Nitish Kumar, can also be heard in some other middle class Muslims
 lekin patna main dawa kii dukaan chalaane vaale 44 varshiya afak akhtar is baat ko lekar khed jataate hai ki alpsankhyakon ke paas vikalpon kaa abhaav he
 Akhtar says, "but, it's like everybody
" hamaare paas, hamaari pasand kaa ek bhi netaa nahin he
 However, Afaq agrees that the Congress' support of the decision will undoubtedly affect the party's prospects in the state
 unki patni rubina akhtar kaa maananaa he ki muslimon ko lalu or nitish main se chunaav karnaa hoga
 She says, "muslims will like to vote for Lalu in the seats from where bjp's Nitish's alliance partner is contesting elections
" aisa mana ja rahaa he ki agar chunaav baad anukool paristhitiyaan nahin banati hai to congress rajd ke saath aakar shoonyata ko puraa karegi
 "JD (U) is also completely careful
" bhaajapa ke saath abhi tak sanyukt raily ko anjaam nahin diya gaya he
 LK Advani's first visit was on 19 October - the last day of campaigning for the first phase of voting
 sanyog se, adwani ko un 47 siton se dur rakhaa gaya he jahaan muslimon kii acchhee-khaasi sankhya main maujuudagi he-jin siton par 21 aktubar ko chunaav hona he
 However, the decision is yet to come in the electoral politics of Bihar
 ayodhya faisle kaa asar or raajnneetik dalon ke rukh ko bhi philhal pahachaanaa nahin ja saktaa he
 It seems that most people are not yet able to assess how this will affect all Muslims
 lekin ateet main mudde ko dharmik dhruvikaran kaa kaaran banate hue dekha gaya he, beshak bhavottejnaa se bharpoor lahar ek baar phir gusse or dukh se sarabor alpsankhyak samudaay ko apane mastishk ko badal kar koi drudh faisla lene ke liye majbootee pradaan kar sakati he

 Of the 243 assembly seats in the state, Muslim votes hold an important position on 60, while on 24 seats, they can play a decisive role

 rajyon ke sanyukt vikaas suchakank par raghuram rajan samiti kii report haal main prakashit hui he or log yah tippanee kar rahe hai ki gujarat kaa pradarshan acha nahin he
 The logic of Gujarat not performing well, especially in terms of human development, is not new
 jab aankadon kii baat aati he to ek sampurna aankada (ebsolute figure) hota he or ek aisa aankada hota he, jisamen uttarottar vruddhi (inkrement) hoti rahati he
 There is a difference between these two
 kisi rajya ke prati vyakti gharelu utpaada kaa udhaaharan len
 If i talk about the whole figure, Punjab will be at the top of it, far ahead of Bihar
 lekin agar badaae vaale aankade dekhen to bihar is shrenee main sabase upar hoga, punjab se kaaphi aage
 There is a difference in the base of these two
 kya iskaa matlab yah he ki punjab acha pradarshan kar rahaa he yaa bihar kaa pradarshan kharaab he?main aisa nahin samajhataa
 Similarly, i do not think that the story of Gujarat's development has ever been about Bess
 yah sudhaar ke bare main thi
 Some figures understand this
 akhil bhartiya sakshartaa dar varsh 1991 main 52
 2 percent, 65 in 2001
 4 fisadi or 2011 main 74 fisadi thi
 Literacy rate of Gujarat 61 in the year 1991
 2 fisadi, 2001 main 69
 1 per cent and 79 in 2011
 3 fisadi thi
 Similarly, in percentage terms, the all-india literacy rate has improved more than Gujarat between 1991 and 2001, but between 2001 and 2011 it has improved less than Gujarat
 mahila sakshartaa main bhi aisa hi rukh he
 Or take the case of dropout rate during primary education in Gujarat
 pehali se paanchavin kaksha ke dauraan 2000-01 main yah 20
 93 per cent and just 2 in 2011-12
 07 fisadi tha
 As a final example, let's talk about sex ratio
 puure desh ke bacchon main (0-6 varsh) 1991 main linganupaat 945, 2001 main 927 or 2011 main 919 tha jabaki is dauraan gujarat main bal linganupaat varsh 1991 main 928, 2001 main 883 or 2011 main 890 tha
 Between 2001 and 2011, the sex ratio of children across the country has deteriorated, while Gujarat has improved marginally
 haalanki, 890 kaa aankada ab bhi kharaab hi he
 If one is interested in knowing the effects of government policies, the sex ratio at birth can be considered as an alternative indicator of child sex ratio
 puure desh main yah varsh 2001 main 984 tha or 2011 main 906
 But in Gujarat it was 837 in 2001 and 909 in 2011
 main is sudhaar kii vyakhya nitiyon ke sakaaratmak asar ke rup main karne ko taiyaar tha
 i can give many more examples from all indicators, but this raises the issue of overall versus growth as well as the problem of development
 zyaadaatar maanav vikaas ranking main puraane aankadon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 For example, the last health survey was done in 2005-06
 ise yaad rakhana ahm he
 Now Raghuram Rajan talks about the committee
 kisi bhi rajyavar ranking main aapako nimna chijen kerani padati haih(e) prabhavit karne vaale karkon kii pahachaanah akasar aankadon kaa abhaav aapako un karkon ko shaamil karne se roak detaa he, jinhen aap shaamil karnaa chaahate the
 The environment is a good example of this, like the rate of disease
 (bi) samanyikaran kii vidhi nikaalen
 Let's understand with an example, there are many big and small states in the country
 bade rajyon or chote rajyon ke bich tulana ko sambhav banane ke liye karkon ko jansankhya yaa bhugolic kshetra ke hisaab se vibhajit kar sakate hai
 (C) Determine the weightage for the identified factors
 (di) ekatrikaran kaa tarika tay karen
 These are serious issues
 inamen kisi bhi pher-badal se index vailu badal jaati he or uske natijatan ranking bhi
 So you have to justify whatever choices you have made from (A) to (D) and do a kind of simulation exercise to test how strong your index value is
