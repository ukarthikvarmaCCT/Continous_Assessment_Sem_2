 Superstar Prabhas' latest film Saaho is struggling to recover the cost of production at the box office
 jabaki produsar ko is film se baari nuksaan hua he
 Prabhas too has not received any special accolades for this film
 reports kii maane to film ke produsar ne is film ke liye 50 karod rupye udhaar liye the or isamen prabhas ko garenter banaaya gaya tha
 Now in such a situation, the producer of the film had to bear the loss as well as its impact on Prabhas too
 shart ke mutabik agar film ke kaaran produsar ko nuksaan hota he to prabhas ko agali kai filmon main free main kaam karnaa pad saktaa he
 According to Bollywood Hungama, the producers took huge money from the market for the film and Prabhas signed as a guarantor for a sum of 50 crores
 ab agar saaho apni production kii laagat nikaalane main fail sabit hoti he to unhen is raashi kaa bhugtan karne ke liye agali kai filmon main muft main kaam karnaa padegaa
 The value of this amount will be Rs 78 crore with interest
 prabhas ko ab shaayad ek rupaya bhi nahin milegaa
 Instead, they will now also have to take responsibility for borrowed money
 yuvi production udhaar liye paison ko chukaane ke liye property bechney par vichaar kar rahi he

 Apparently it will also have 4G free 4G internet and calling under the welcome offer, as the news is that the welcome offer can be extended till March
 khabar he ki agle saal ise pesh kiya ja saktaa he jo desh kaa sabase sasta 4G handset hoga or shaayad duniya kaa bhi
 It is worth noting that at present, there are 4G handsets up to 4 thousand rupees in the market
 inamen reliance jeeyo kii company Lyf ke bhi smartfones shaamil hai jisaki shuruyaat 2,999 rupee se he
 Since the company has already launched cheap 4G handsets, it would not be surprising if a new 4G handset is launched for Rs 1,000 or 1,500
 philhal company kii taraf se isaki koi jaankaree nahin di gai he, lekin bataaya yah ja rahaa he ki isamen Spreadtrum 9820 procesar diya jayega

 desh bhar main telecom operators 4gsuru karne kii taiyaari main hanore dhire dhire apni servison ko bade shaharon ke baad ab chote shaharon main bhi badha rahe hai

 The company wants to get more and more customers and hence if people do not have 4G handsets, then they will not be able to use Jio SIM
 isliye jitna saste se sasta smartphone launch karke company logon tak apana sim pahunchaana chaahati he

 The Prime Minister reached Narendra Modi half an hour before the scheduled time in the morning
 unhone sant ravidaas ki murti par mattha tikaaya phir santon se baat kii or pangat main baithkar sant kaa lungar bhi chakhaa
 Later, the anchor builders went to the cook to meet the servicemen
 takreeban 25 minute mandir main rah kar apni maujuudagi kaa makasad bataa kar pradhanmantri chale gaye
 After him, the Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal arrived to pay obeisance to Ravidas
 unhone lungar to nahin chakhaa par thodaa prasad zarur liya or santon se baatcheet kii
 In the end, the work that Sant Ravidas was engaged in, even today, the Kurtis are the same ham aisi hi kuritiyon ke khilaaf lard rahe hai
 This is our mission too
 isi mishan ki safalataa kaa aashirwad lene aae hai
 It is clear that Kejriwal ji explained his motive for Punjab election in a gesture
 is bich in donon netaaon ke aane se banaras or sant ke darbar main inke samarthakon main uthaa patake bhi chalati rahi
 Raidasi Sant Niranjan Das, who went out of the temple due to the arrival of the Prime Minister before the scheduled time in the morning, was stopped due to security reasons when he wanted to come inside the PM
 jisase unke bhakton main gaharaa asantosh hua or pradhanmantri ke khilaaf narebaaji bhi hui
 On the other hand, activists of the Aam Aadmi Party and BJP shouted slogans in the Sunderpur area and fierce stone-pelting took place in which many people were also injured
 bataa den ki banaras jahaan pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa sansadeey kshetra he vahiin, 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar ke baad arvind kejariwal pehali baar banaras pahunche the
 The comments aaj kii jativaadee raajnneeti or ek duusare se upar uthne or apana kaam nikaalane ke liye rajaneta kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai
 Elections are to be held in Punjab this year, 25 lakh people who follow Sant Ravidas come here
 agle saal upi main chunaav hai or 21 percent upi main bhi sant ravidaas ko maanane vaale log hai
 That is, coming here was not a means to bake political bread

 He did not taste the langar but took some prasad and spoke to the saints
 ant main kaha ki sant ravidaas jis kaam main lage the aaj bhi wo kureetiyaan waisi hi hai
 We are fighting against similar evils
 hamaara mishan bhi yahi he
 We have come to take the blessings of success of this mission
 saafe he ki punjab chunaav ke apane makasad ko kejariwal ji ne ishaare ishaare main samajha diya
 Meanwhile, with the arrival of these two leaders, the supporters of Banaras and the saint continued to fall into their supporters
 subah tay samay se pehle pradhanmantri ke aa jane se mandir se baahar gaye raidasi sant niranjan das jab piem ke aane par andar aana chaahate the to suraksha kaarnon se unhen roak diya gaya

 a very embarrassing incident has come to light in Jaunpur, UP
 yahaan ke khetasarai thana kshetra main ek yuvak dwaara apni chacheri bahan kii izzat luute jane kii keemat gaanv main hui panchayat main dhai lakh rupee tay kii gai he
 With the decision, the Panchayat has instructed the aggrieved party not to complain to the police
 yuvati kii izzat se khilwaad karne vaala yuvak gaanv kaa hi rahane vaala he or rishte main ladqi kaa chachera bhai he
 This overbearing youth was raping her cousin for six months
 ladqi ke munh kholane par vah use dhamkee dekar chup kara detaa tha
 The matter was disclosed two days ago on Wednesday when the girl's family saw the young man in an objectionable position
 iske baad un logon ne yuvak ko kaaphi maaraa-peeta
 This thing spread throughout the village
 ladqi ke gharavaale maamle ko police ko die jane ke paksh main the par gaanv ke hi kuch logon ne unhen aisa karne se roak diya
 He insisted on resolving the matter through the panchayat
 iske baad shuukravaar ko dopaher main gaanv ke junior hiskool main panchayat hui
 In the panchayat, the panches ruled that the family of the accused youth would have to pay two and a half lakh rupees to the victim girl
 iske saath hi ladqa ab ladqi ke ghar kii taraf nahin jayega
 On the other hand, the Superintendent of Police of Jaunpur has also said that the matter should be investigated
 assam ke vidhansabha chunaavon main is baar seemapar se gaiyrkanoonee ghuspaith sabase bada mudda rahi he
 But to know how big this problem is, India Today's Special Investigation Team visited Assam and learned how easy it is for a foreigner to get Indian citizenship through fake documents
 videshi bhi denge votjaanch ke dauraan jo sabase zyada pareshaan kar dene vaali baat saamne ai wo yah ki kuch avaidh apravasi, jinhen tribunel ne aadhikarik taur par videshi ghoshit kiya hua he lekin unke paas ab bhi vot dene kaa adhikaar he
 So when the second phase of voting takes place in Assam on April 11, not only Indian citizens but some illegal immigrants from Bangladesh will also vote
 bangladeshi apravasiyon ke liye bharat kii naagarikta paanaa kitna aasaan he yah jaanane ke liye india today kii team nisam kedhubari kaa daura kiya
 Dhubri falls in the area of assam-bangladesh border
 brahmaputra nadi kii vajah se is jile kaa bada hissaa khulaa he
 The district has a 75 percent Muslim population
 assam or khaastaur par dhubari main muslimon kii aabaadi puure bharat kii tulana main teji se bad rahi he
 Locals complain that the illegal infiltration from Bangladesh is due to the increasing Muslim population in the area
 kitna aasaan he farji dastavej se naagarikta paanaa?sachai kaa pataa lagane ke liye india today kii team sabase pehle district transport offis gai
 Where driving licenses are made for Indians only
 lekin offis ke baahar rahane vaale dallalon ko isse khaas fark nahin padataa ki license banavaane vaala bhartiya he yaa bangladeshi
 India Today team met a broker named Abu Tahab
 use bataaya gaya ki jiskaa license banvaanaa he vah bangladeshi he
 The broker asked for 10 thousand rupees in return and said that the license would be made at Dhubri's address
 dalal ne iske liye 1 maheene kaa samay maanga
 Only 27 thousand illegal intruders live in Dhubri, it is quite easy to come to Assam from Bangladesh
 kyonki brahmaputra nadi kii vajah se seemaa par baad lagaana lagbhag asambhav he
 The first thing any immigrant needs is a citizenship certificate, which is available for just Rs 10,000
 saal 2013 se hi neshnal register of citigens offis yah rajya main videshiyon kii sankhya pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 When the India Today team reached Dhubri's District Office of NRC, it was found that there have been many cases of Bangladeshi immigrants acquiring citizenship through fake documents
 enarasi kii jaanch main pataa laga ki sirf dhubari jile main hi 27 hajaar avaidh ghuspaithiye hai
 Explain that this is the figure which is officially filed, in fact more number of Bangladeshi immigrants are present
 india today kii timne iske baad assam ke chirang jile kaa daura kiya
 The situation here was almost the same as Dhubri
 yahaan mahaj 5 hajaar rupee main berth certificate mil rahe the
 If someone wants to get a fake school living certificate, then he will have to pay Rs 5000 and if he wants to get a driving license, then he will have to pay Rs 3500
 jo sabase zyada hairaan karne vaala tha vah yah ki neshnal register of citigens ne aise kai maamalon kaa pataa lagaaya he jahaan avaidh apravasi asli bhartiya voter card tak banavaane main safal ho chuke hai

 ’ a new twist in the Suryanelli gang rape case came when the victim lodged a police complaint stating that Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman PJ Kurien should be made an accused

 Dharmarajan absconded after getting bail in the case and was recently arrested in Karnataka
 shikayatakarta ke anusaar, dharmarajan ne ek televijan channel ko bataaya ki vah 19 farvari 1996 ko kumali vishram grih jate vakt courian ke saath unki gaadi main maujuud tha
 The victim was sexually harassed at the Kumli Rest House

 He said that the complaint of the victim is to make Kurian an accused
 ab tak courian ke khilaaf koi police maamla yaa praathmiki nahin he
 The lawyer claimed that the police came to the conclusion after Kurian's name was mentioned that it was not possible for Kurien to be at the Kumli rest house, being elsewhere
 isliye unhen kabhi aaropee nahin banaaya gaya
 The complaint lodged at the Chingavanam police station also demanded that Dharmarajan and two others arrested in Karnataka, Unnikrishnan and Jamal, should also be brought to the dock as accused

 vakil ne daawa kiya ki courian kaa naam aane par police is nishkarsh par pahunchi ki anyatra hone ke kaaran courian ke liye kumali vishram grih par hona sambhav nahin he
 Therefore, he was never accused

 If the Indian opener Virender Sehwag plays a little time at the crease, then the stance of the match changes but in this World Cup, he plans to increase the odds of his rivals by playing the full 50 overs
 vah abhi tak vanade match ke puure 50 over nahin khel sake hai
 Sehwag said, i think i have never played 50 overs in one day cricket
 abhi tak maine 43 yaa 44 over khele hai
 But this time i will bat for 50 overs and try to give a good start to the team
 main pichley 10 saalon se 50 over tak ballebaaji karne kii koshish kar rahaa hum or asafal rahaa hum, lekin prayaas abhi tak jari he
 a lot of expectations are being raised this time, but Sehwag said he is not feeling pressured, as captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and coach Gary Kirsten have asked him to play his natural game, whatever the circumstances may be
 sahvaag ne kaha, koi bhi mujhe yah nahin kah rahaa ki mujhe kya karnaa hoga, yah hamaari team kii acchhee baat he
 The coach and captain have asked me to bat as i do
 isliye ve mere upar koi dabaav nahin badha rahe hai
 All he has said is to play his natural game
 agar tum ran bana sako, to ham khush honge, lekin agar tum aisa nahin kar pate to bhi ham khush honge
 Sehwag said, my role is to get the team off to the crease
 agar main 10 gend main 20 ran banaata hum yaa 70 yaa 80 gend main 100 ran banaata hum, to main isse khush hum
 The 32-year-old's style is to take an aggressive approach as soon as he comes to the crease, but Sehwag said that he has reduced his offensive tendency slightly
 unhone kaha, pichley teen saalon se main acha kar rahaa hum or maine thodaa badlaav bhi kiya he
 Now i pay a little respect to the new ball
 main sunishchit karata hum ki main gendbaajon par haaavee hone se pehle chaar-paanch over khel luun or phir team ko acchhee shuruyaat dilaane kii koshish karun
 Sehwag said, "I know we have Dhoni, Virat Kohli, Yusuf Pathan, Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina in the middle order, so i can be aggressive with the first ball
" lekin ab main teen-chaar over khilne ke baad sunishchit karata hum ki main team ko acchhee shuruyaat duun
 He has scored a lot of runs for India in Tests, but his record in odis is not so much impressive as compared to a five-day match
 lekin sahvaag par aankadon kaa koi asar nahin padataa or unka kahana he ki team kii safalataa ke liye unka yogadan hi myne rakhata he
 He said, i am happy with my performance in ODI cricket
 aisa isliye he, kyonki har koi is bare main baat kar rahaa he ki meraa test ausat 54 kaa he, jabaki vanade kaa ausat sirf 35 he, lekin isse meraa pradarshan kharaab nahin dikhataa
 Sehwag said, yes i can do better than what i have performed, but i am happy
 main vanade cricket main lagaataar acha pradarshan karne par dhyaan laga rahaa hum
 But as long as i contribute to the team, i am happy
 yah poochne par ki kya vah kandhe kii chot se puri tarah ubar gaye hai, to unhone kaha, main niyamit upachaar le rahaa hum or ummid he ki main puri tarah se thik ho jaaoongaa
 Despite concerns of a shoulder injury, he said he would bowl in the World Cup, but only after he was fully fit
 unhone kaha, nishchit rup se main gendbaaji karnaa chahta hum
 i want to contribute for Team India

 Prior to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyer called Narendra Modi a 'chai wala' to humiliate Narendra Modi
 yah shabd modi ke liye chunaav main sanjivani sabit hua tha
 After this word, the BJP then launched a 'discussion on tea', which benefited the BJP and the Congress was defeated badly in that election
 tab bhaajapa bahumat ke saath centre main satta main ai thi or desh main 30 saal baad kisi ek dal ko desh main spasht bahumat mila tha

 Akharas have arrived in Kumbh
 inhen akhaadon ke mahanton ne ajtak kii chaoupal main hissaa liya
 The Mahant who arrived in Chaupal appeared angry with the Modi government and also warned that if not the temple, not even Modi in 2019
 is bich charchaa he ki kumbh meley ke dauraan vishwa hindu parishad prayagraj main dharm sansad bula saktaa he
 However, Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad President Mahant Narendra Giri Maharaj said that no political party or even Vishwa Hindu Parishad has the right to call a Dharma Sansad
 mahendra giri ke mutabik, dharm sansad bulaae jane kaa adhikaar sirf chaar peethon ke shankaracharya ko he
 Mahant Narendra Giri Maharaj, President of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad, who came in Aaj Tak's chaupal, said that Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party did not get votes in the name of development
 agar vikaas ke naam par vot miltaa to uttar pradesh kaa mukhyamantri koi or hota yaa shaayad akhilesh yadav mukhyamantri hote
 After the Godhra incident, Modi's Hinduist face came to the fore, people thought that if there would be a yogi in UP, a Ram temple would be built if Modi lives there
 modi ke raaj main vikaas ho rahaa he
 Getting electricity sadaken banaai ja rahi hai
 But people will vote in the name of Ram temple
 yadi aap ram mandir nahin banaate hai to bada mushkil ho jayega
 The government could not meet the expectations of the people, Mahant Narendra Giri says that the government is not showing a positive trend regarding the Ram temple and it seems that the temple will not be built, so we are just waiting for the examination of the Supreme Court order
 rajaneta mandir nahin bana paaenge
 Mahant Narendra Giri Maharaj warned that i think the government will have to bear the brunt of this in 2019 because what people expected was not fulfilled
 ram mandir banegaa, tabhi sarkaar lautegivahin, ajtak kii chaoupal main ram mandir masale par baat karte hue niranjani akhaada ke pramukh mahant keshav puri ne kaha ki sadhu sant mahatmaon ne isiilie bijepi kaa saath diya ki ram mandir banegaa or ek samasya hal hogi, lekin abhi aisa lagata he ki saadhe 4 saal ho gaye hai phir bhi ram mandir ke bare main sarkaar vichaar nahin kar rahi he
 Keshav Puri said that this government will stand only when the Ram temple will be built, otherwise it seems difficult, because the confidence of the people will be lost
 mahant keshav puri kaa kahana he ki ham chaahate hai ki mandir bane or tabhi bijepi kii dobaaraa sarkaar ban sakati he varanaa mujhe to bahut mushkil lagata he kyonki hindu samaaj hi bijepi se judaa hua he
 Mahant Ganesh Anand Saraswati, head of Anand Akhara, who is involved in the government's chaupal, says that the Ram temple is a matter of our faith and the government is not in a position to do much as the matter is under consideration in the court
 mahant ganesh anand saraswati bhi maanate hai ki sadhu santon main is baat ko lekar naaraazgi he lekin wo kehete hai ki sarkaar ke haath bandhe hue hai
 Politicians are not allowing the construction of the Rastaram temple
 The President of the Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad has suggested that the decision will be taken if only Muslim religious leaders and Hindu Dharma Gurus sit together to build a Ram temple
 vah isliye nahin baithe hai kyonki rajaneta baithne nahin de rahe hai

 film 'baar-baar dekho' kii kahani ek premi jode jai verma or diya kapur kii he
 They are young today, but their views are slightly different
 ek taraf jai apane kariyar ke alaava kisi chiz ko mahatv nahin detaa to duusari taraf diya kariyar ke saath-saath parivaar, shaadi jaisi sabhi khushiyon ko mahatv detii he
 Suddenly two days before the wedding, Jai goes to sleep in his future, he reaches old age where he is seen by all
 isse aage kahani par baat karnaa sahi nahin hoga, kyonki kahani kaa majaa khatm ho jayega
 It may have been nice to hear the concept or script of this film, but director Nitya Mehra could not put the film on screen properly
 agar takneekee taur par dekhen to kahani ko bhavishya or bhootkaal main daudane ke liye shaayad nitya kii saraahna ho, magar aam darshak ko yah sab samajhane main samay lagegaa
 The film lacks a lot of entertainment
 siddharth bhi is kirdaar main kuch khaas nahin lage
 Emotional scenes called producer Karan Johar's weapon are also isolated and those that do not touch the heart
 tippaniyan If we talk about the goodness of the film then it is the subject of it
 film bataati he ki agar aap apane prem ke bhavishya ko dekh len to kya aap apni galatiyon ko sudhaarney kii koshish karenge? film yah bhi bataati he ki balance ke bina koi bhi gananaa parfect nahin hoti
 Yesterday was out of hand and tomorrow, there is no idea what will come, so make today's moments better
 katrina kaiff apane role main jami hai or film kaa sangeet release se pehle hi hit ho chukaa he
 An attempt has been made to make a love story differently but the screenplay weakened
 'baar-baar dekho' ko aap ek baar dekh len vahi film ke liye kaaphi hoga
 So my rating for this film is 2 stars
 achaanak shaadi se do din pehle neend main jai apane bhavishya main chalaa jaataa he, vah budhaape tak pahunch jaataa he jahaan sab use bichade hue nazar aate hai
 It will not be right to talk about the story further, because the fun of the story will end
 is film kaa concept yaa script sunne main to shaayad acha laga ho, lekin nirdeshak nitya mehara film ko parade par thik se nahin utaar paae
 Technically speaking, Nitya might be appreciated for running the story in future and past, but it will take time for the general audience to understand all this
 film main manoranjan kii khaasi kami he
 Siddharth too did not look special in this character
 nirmaataa karan johar kaa hathiyaar kahe jane vaale imotional drishy bhi ikkaa-dukka hai or jo hai ve bhi dil ko nahin choote
 The comments film kii achchhaayiyon kii agar baat karen to vah iskaa vishay he
 The film tells that if you see the future of your love, will you try to rectify your mistakes? The film also states that no calculation is perfect without balance
 beetaa hua kal haath se nikal gaya or aane vaale kal kaa kuch pataa nahin ki kya lekar aayega isliye aaj ke palon ko behatar banaao
 Katri Na Kaif has been frozen in her role and the music of the film has already been a hit before its release
 ek lav story ko alag tarah se banane kii koshish kii gai he magar patakatha kamazor pad gai
 Once you see 'baar Baar Dekho', that will be enough for the film
 isliye is film ke liye meri reating he 2 star

 The Modi government has completed four years and this is the time when looking at the tenure of the government in this period, to see what and how much work he has done on different issues
 baat agar desh kii ek badi aabaadi yani muslim samudaay ke bare main kii jaae to modi sarkaar ne kai aise faisle liye jo samaaj or desh main bade badlaav lekar aaenge
 On the other hand, during these four years, there have been many cases of violence and repression against the minorities in which questions have been raised on the attitude of the Modi government
 desh ke musalamaanon se jude ahm masalon par congress or duusari partiyon kii sarkarein hameshaa haath daalane se kataraati rahi hai
 At the same time, the Modi government has taken bold steps towards Muslims during its four years of rule
 phir chaahe wo teen talaak ke khilaaf kanoon banane kii baat ho yaa phir ek jatke main haj sabsidi ko khatm karne kaa faisla
 PM Modi and his ministers openly say that the government will not go on appeasement but on the path of empowerment
 haj sabsidi khatmaduniya ke musalamaanon kii tarah bharat ke musalmaan bhi saudi arab haj ke liye jate hai
 The central government used to bear the bulk of the travel expenses of Indian Hajis as subsidies

 After which an FIR was also filed against him
 kehete hai ki saare mard ek jaise hote hai
 The girl did not see the eyes start doing mischief
 inhen nazaron kii besharmi ke ek video ne is vakt puri duniya main koharaam machaa rakhaa he
 This video has exposed the poll of men from all over the world who live in any country or city but are definitely staring
 agar aap sochate hai ki surf hindustan main hi sadakon par ladakiyon ko ghuraa jaataa he to aap galat hai
 But after reading this news, all your misconceptions will be cleared
 is khabar se ye sabit hoga ki dilli ho yaa landan, las angelis ho yaa birmingham ladakiyon ko sab jagah sabhi mard ghoorte hai
 Lance Angelis is one of the big cities in America
 par yahaan bhi sadakon par shararti najaron kii kami nahin
 The men here also stare at the girls
 sirf lans angelis hi nahin landan, manchester auki birmingham main bhi yahi haal he
 Here, girls are constantly chased by eyes
 inghurneki harkaton kaa sach saamne aayaa he you tub par or is video ke saamne aate hi puri duniya main chhid gai he ek badi bahes
 The debate is whether the men of the whole world are the same
 aap yakeen nahin karenge
 But believe me, this shocking video has been watched by over 8 million people worldwide till now
 metro stesan main, shoping centre main, sadak par, uniwarsity main har jagah ye ghurti nazaren ladakiyon kaa peechha kar rahi hai
 The biggest disclosure of the maneuvers of these big cities of the world
 darasal newzealand kii do modells ne apane khufia camere se ghurti ankhon ko teesri aankh main kaid kar liya or isaki shuruyaat hui america ke lans angelis shahar se

 These girls captured all the scenes in their camera to expose the roadside Romeos
 ladakiyon ne dikhaa diya ki duniya ke kisi bhi shahar main sadak par chal rahe log ladakiyon ko lalachaai najaron se dekhte hai
 All the people who have been captured in this video are more than one
 ladakiyon ke is video se ek kadava sach phir saamne aa gaya he
 The truth is that there is a tendency to stare at girls and tease them all over the world
 aise main shahar chaahe chota ho yaa bada isse koi fark nahin pasta
 Because all men are the same
 dilli ho yaa mumbai, landan ho yaa los angelis ghurne waalon ko kisi kii parvaah nahin, chhedane waalon ko kisi kaa khauf nahin
 If you see the world, keep watching
 ye baaj nahin aayenge
 Those who stare are neither concerned about society nor the world
 phir chaahe wo duniya kaa koi bhi hissaa kyun na ho, koi bhi shahar kyun na ho
 The girls who shot the video were only for fun
 lekin usee bahaane samaaj kaa ek aisa sach saamne aa gaya jisamen ham roj apane aas-paas dekhne ke baad bhi gaur nahin karte

 Senior Marxist leader VS Achuthanandan, who has called Rahul Gandhi an 'amul Baby', said that the Congress president is behaving like a child and he is not able to deal with the situation
 unhone kaha, ‘agar rahul gandhi vynad se chunaav lard rahe hai to kya badal jayega? vam dal ko rahul or bijepi se ek saath ladanaa hoga
 'CPM leader & former Kerala CM VS Achuthanandan in his Facebook post: i called Rahul Gandhi' Amul Baby 'earlier, because of his attitude of approaching situations without understanding them
 What will happen in Wayanad if Rahul comes? Left parties will fight against Rahul & BJP
 - ANI (@ANI) April 1, 2019 He further stated in his Facebook post that what is the position of Congress today, he argues that he is the main contestant against BJP, but it has been proved wrong
 yahi vajah thi ki rahul gandhi ko maine amul baby kaha tha, jo aaj bhi praasangik he

 kapade dhone ke baad unhen press karnaa ek bahut bada kaam he
 Although relief can be provided by giving clothes to the washerman, but there are many risks in giving clothes to the washerman
 kai baar aisa hota he ki dhobi samay se kapade nahin lautaata he yaa phir kai baar wo kapade kharaab kar detaa he
 In such a situation, most people prefer to press clothes themselves instead of giving clothes to the washerman
 agar aap bhi apane kapade ghar par hi press karte hai to ye upaay aapke kaaphi kaam aa sakate hai
 By adopting these measures, you can press more clothes in less time and less effort: 1
 har kapade par spray karne se behatar he ki aap ek saaf tauliye ko gilaa kar len
 After that squeeze it with light hands
 jitne bhi kapade press karne ke liye hai unhen us tauliye main achche se lapetakar rakh dijie
 There will be no need to spray each cloth and light moisture will come in all the clothes
 jis tarah spray karne ke baad kapade acchhee tarah press hote hai thik usee tarah tauliye main lapetakar rakhane ke baad bhi ho jaaenge
 2
 kapadon ko dryer main sukhaane kaa tarika bhi aapkaa vakt bachaa saktaa he
 Drying the clothes on the slow skin does not cause too much shrinkage
 jisase unhen press karne ke dauraan bahut adhik mehnat nahin kerani padati he
 3
 kapadon ko dhone ke baad sahi tareeke se tah lagaana bhi bahut jaruri he
 If you keep your clothes folded just after washing, they will shrink more
 aise main unhen tareeke se rakhana bahut jaruri he
 4
 kapadon ko dhone ke baad jab unhen dhoop dikhaanaa ho to sidhe rassi par na daalen
 Before that, grab the cloth and grab it with both hands
 isse wo kaaphi had tak sidhe ho jaaenge
 Clothes dried in this way quickly press
 5
 There is a way to press every cloth
 kapade ko puraa failaakar ek kinare se shuruyaat karte hue duusare kone tak pahunchnaa chahie
 Pressing from time to time does not allow the clothes to press properly and takes more time

 Navjot Singh Sidhu, a former Indian cricket team opener and currently a minister in Punjab after winning the election, is not taking the name of the political ruckus when the TV show was part of the show
 punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh bhale hi punjab ke edwocket general kii raay ke baad navjot singh siddhu ko TV sho main kaam karne par green signal de chuke hai lekin akali dal jaisi vipakshi partiyaan unka lagaataar virodh kar rahi hai
 They are raising many questions along with the dignity and morality of the ministerial post
 mantri hote hue kapil ke lofter sho kaa hissaa hone par ve virodh jataa rahe hai
 Actually, Navjot Singh Sidhu has been sitting on the chair of the judge in Kapil Sharma's show for the last two weeks
 aise main sho ke hasya kalakaar unke mantri pad kaa majaak banaate hai
 Some comedian Navjot Singh tells Sidhu that you have become a very big minister
 unki sifarish kar dijie
 Get them a job
 to vahiin koi hasya kalakaar lalabatti dilwane kii maang navjot singh siddhu se karata he
 Nawjot Singh Sidhu's ministerial position is mentioned in the show as jokes during this whole laugh
 isi baat ko lekar akali dal ke netaaon ne navjot singh siddhu ko mantri pad kii garima or naitikta kii yaad dilaai he
 Senior Akali Dal leaders raised objections: Senior leader of the Akali Dal and former minister Bikram Singh Majithia and former finance minister Parminder Singh Dhindsa said that even though the law does not prohibit Navjot Singh Sidhu from doing TV shows, but a minister's morality and Given the dignity, Navjot Singh Sidhu should refrain from making fun of his ministerial position in this way
 donon ne kaha ki unhen ye sab dekhakar behad hi afsos hota he or siddhu ko naitikta ke aadhaar par is tarah ke TV sho chhod dene chahie
 Captain Amarinder refrained from reacting, the Punjab government also wants to end the ruckus on this whole matter
 isi vajah se punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh or khud cabinet mantri navjot singh siddhu is puure maamle par kuch bhi kehane se batch rahe hai
 When Captain Amarinder Singh was asked about the morality of the Akali Dal, the Captain turned the talk and said that it has been just a week to the government
 sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par abhi sawaal uthaanaa uchit nahin
 At the same time, Navjot Singh Sidhu, known for his brazenness, also remained silent on the question of the Akali Dal's advice and he also cut off all these questions
 congress pravaktaa ne kiya siddhu kaa bachaavasangrur se congress ke vidhayak or AICC ke pravaktaa vijay inder singla ne siddhu kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki siddhu bataur kalakaar apni profeshnal life main kuch bhi karen, lekin agar ve mantri pad lathik se nirvahananheen karte yaa apane kaamkaaj main koi kotahi baratate hai tabhi aise sawaal uthaae jane chahie
 He termed the advice of the Akali Dal as his frustration
 punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh or navjot singh siddhu donon kii koshish he ki siddhu kaa ye TV sho vivaad ab khatm ho or log unke TV sho main kaam karne kii baat ko darkinar kar wo mantri pad par rahane ke dauraan kiye gaye kaam ke liye anken
 Although it does not seem that in the coming days, this TV show controversy is going to leave the chase of Navjot Singh Sidhu

 Although India has a 100% win record against Bangladesh in the T20 International, but there have been very exciting and thorny matches between the two countries
 aisa hi ek yaadgaar muqabla 2016 tii-20 world cap main rahaa
 The match raised the hearts of the audience
 23 march 2016 ko team india ke purv captainmahendra singh dhonine apane kool temprament kaa aisa namoona pesh kiya jisaki aaj tak charchaa kii ja rahi he
 World T20 was a 'do or die' match against Bangladesh in 2016, in which Bangladesh's victory seemed almost certain
 lekin, dhoni ko kuch or hi manjuur tha
 Dhoni played Bangladesh in the T20 World Cup match at the ground in Rulayabengaluru
 jisamen team india ne pehle ballebaaji karte hue 7 wicket par 146 ran banaae
 Bangladesh team's wickets, chasing a target of 147 runs, also kept falling at frequent intervals
 lekin, lakshya zyada bada nahin tha
 Bangladesh lost 136 wickets for 136 runs by the 19th over
 krij par mushfikur rahim or mahamudullah khel rahe the
 It seemed that the Bangladesh team would easily make this match
 lekin, mahendra singh dhoni ne aisa nahin hone diya
 The match's stance changed in the last over
 chauthi gend par mushfikur rahim kaich out ho gaye
 At the same time, Mahmudullah was also caught out on the fifth ball
 team indiyane aakhri 3 gend main bangladesh ko 2 ran nahin banane die the
 Bangladesh needed two runs off the final ball in this match
 pandya kii of stump ke baahar phenki gai gend tak suvagata home nahin pahunch sake or bai ran ke liye daud pade
 As the ball came to Dhoni and he ran towards the wicket to run out Mustafizur Rahman
 dhoni ne bijli si teji dikhaate hue mustafijur ko ran out kar diya
 In this way, India won the match by one run margin
 bharat kii dharti par bangladesh team india ke khilaaf duusari baar koi tii-20 international match khelegi
 The last time both teams were on face-to-face in the same match of the 2016 T20 World Cup on Indian soil

 When and when will the T20 matches be played? Let us tell you that the first match of the three-match T20 series will be played at the Keerun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi
 iske baad donon tiimon ko doosraa tii-20 7 november ko rajkot main or teesraa tii-20 10 november ko nagpur main khelnaa he
 In the last T20 series against South Africa, Team India had to be satisfied with the result of 1–1 draw, but against Bangladesh, Team India would like to win all the matches of the three-match T20 series
 pakistan ne sweekaar kiya he ki hurriyat netaaon se pakistani ucchayukta abdul basit kii mulaakaat kii timming puri tarah sahi nahin thi
 Remember that because of Basit's meeting with Hurriyat leaders, India canceled the Foreign Secretary level talks which were to be held in Islamabad on 25 August
 sartaaj ajij ne yuan main modi ke bhaashan kii tarif kii
 He said, 'the positive thing i found in the speech of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, when he said that he wants to improve relations with his neighboring countries including Pakistan
 ''hurriyat bhi stekholder he'pakistan ke rashtriya suraksha or videsh maamle ke salaahkaar sartaaj ajij ne hedlins today se exclusive baatcheet main kaha, 'ham hurriyat se baat karne kaa haq nahin chodenge
 However, the timing of the meeting with the High Commissioner, we can call it unnecessary
 timming kii baat sahi he, lekin buniyadi baat ye he ki jab bhi kashmir kii baat hogi to hamen unase (hurriyat se) hi kerani hogi
 We cannot leave the Kashmir issue, because in this case he (hurriyat) is also a stake holder
 ''baatcheet behaal karne kaa jimmaa bharat'sartaaj ajij ne kaha ki pakistan rajanyikon or hurriyat netaaon ke bich bhent pichley 30 saal se hoti rahi he or usamen nayaa kuch nahin tha
 He said, since India suspended the dialogue, it is also India's job to restore it
 unhone kaha, 'hamen ye ummid thi ki donon netaa milenge
 The meeting of the leaders of both countries gives impetus to the dialogue
 yah bharat par nirbhar karata he
 If India takes the initiative, we are waiting for it
 'unhone kaha, 'is maamle main shaayad samay puri tarah sahi nahin tha kyonki kashmir par ullekhneey vaarta abhi shuru honi thi
 He said that the agenda for bilateral talks was to be announced in the Foreign Secretary level talks
 'nahin radd honi chahie thi baatcheetahaalanki sartaaj ajij ne videsh sachiv str kii baatcheet radd karne ke bharat ke faisle ko bhi anuchit bataaya
 He said, 'it was not a good decision to cancel the meeting
 ye itnaa bada masalaa nahin tha ki donon deshon ke sachivon kii baat ko radd kar diya jaae
 He said that the meeting which was canceled, should be resumed, which will improve the relationship between the two countries
 duniya ke sabhi deshon ke liye acchhee baat he ki bharat or pakistan ke rishte achche hon
 The Kashmiri people should be recognized
 While defending the statement of Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif in the United Nations, Sartaj said that the solution of Kashmir should be valid for the people of that country, so PM Nawaz asked to know the opinion of the people there
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki hamane kisi tisare ko is baatcheet main shaamil nahin kiya
 He said that we are ready to have a serious dialogue to improve the relationship
 unhone kaha, 'sab chaahate hai ki tallukaat behatar hon
 But the Army has its own work
 unka kaam he mulk kii raksha karnaa
 The general perception about the Pakistani Army is not right
 'unhone kaha, 'hamane army ko yah bharosa dilaayaa he ki rat kii jo dephence kii taiyaari he, hamaari army ko bhi usee tarah se taiyaari kerani he
 'imran's movement will weaken
 Sartaj Aziz also spoke on the protests led by Qadri and Imran Khan in Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki dirghakaal main navaj sharif or pakistan main loktantr donon hi majboot honge
 The whole parliament united with Nawaz Sharif
 yahaan tak ki vipakshi partiyon ne bhi saaf kiya he ki kisi bhi vajah se vah demokrasi ko kamjor nahin hone denge
 He said, 'nawaz Sharif saheb has done everything possible to solve our basic issues
 ye jo kuch hajaar logon kaa virodh pradarshan tha, vah dhire-dhire kamjor padane lagegaa

 the performances are superb !! ! Dialogues have many laugh out loud crackling moments! abhayrchopra # bareillykibarfi is such a pure & a complete entertainer
 @kritisanon is brilliant & it's her best performance , @ayushmannk is honest (1 / 2)and @rajkummarrao ,take a bow man !! You fly :) i wish # bareilykibarfi team all the luck and congratulations once again !! (2 / 2) This time through the editorial in the mouthpiece of Shiv Sena, Asaduddin Owaisi has been targeted
 sampadakeey main asaduddin ke bare main likhaa he ki ve muslim samudaay ke rakshak banakar rashtradroh kii aad main islam ko baantne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The editorial also criticized Parowasi's statement of MIM MLA Waris Pathan being suspended from the assembly
 ovaisi ne vaaris pathan ke nilamban ko loktantr kaa apmaan bataaya tha
 In an editorial on the matter, it has been written for Owaisi that 'hundred ko chal kal ko chal haja'
 itnaa hi nahin sampadakeey main pathan ko sthaayee taur par nilambit karne or chunaav ladane se pratibandhit karne kii bhi baat likhi gai he
 Was told the subsidy on Haj was a waste of money, why did Pathan say that why so much money is spent on building statues of leaders in India? Targeting this statement, it has been written in Saamana editorial that why the government wastes so much money every year on subsidizing Haj? If there is insult to Islam in other countries, then the Muslims there start demonstrating, but why are they not in India? The time has come for Muslims living in India when they have to decide whether they want leaders like Owaisi, Pathan or Javed Akhtar

 sirf yah film hi nahin balki neeraja khud ab mere jivan kaa hissaa ban chuki hai
 In today's era, compassion has reduced a lot, and i got to learn this kindness from Neerja's life
 'tippaniyan Sonam said, 'empathy, kindness and understanding have a very important place in everyone's life

 ) a study has shown that women do not aspire to become mothers, but men also have a strong desire to become 'fathers'
 yah alag baat he ki purush is ichha se adhik yon sambandh ko tavajjo dete hai
 The truth of relationships on the test of research
 
 
 |'kamasutra' main kya he
 
 
 According to a team at Kansas State University, 'baby Fever' (child's desire) is usually related to women, but men are also not untouched by it
 adhyayan dal ke agua geri brass ke hawaale se daily mail ne kaha, ‘‘bavi fever ke bare main yah dharna thi ki logon main achaanak bacchon kii chaah jaagti he
 It was often associated with women, but we found that it is the same with men
 ’’banie vafaadaar, na ki 'bevafa sanam'
 
 
 In their study, the researchers took three points
 pehla he saamaajik-saanskrithik pahalu
 People want children because they are taught about family
 mahila isaliye baccha chaahati he ki samaaj unase apeksha karata he ki ve maa bane
 The second reason is the concept of share of husband and wife
 jab ve kisi sundar shishu ko dekhte hai, to unamem uske prati aaksharn jaagta he or ve chaahate hai ki unka bhi apana baccha ho
 The third is the emotional cause
 mastishk ke ek hisse se duusare hisse main sanket janaa ki yah bachche ke lihaaj se acha samay he
 Professor Brasse said, "sometimes you want a child, sometimes you want to have money or you get fame or want sex
" hamane logon se poocha ki ye ichchhaayein koun se kram main hai
 Researchers found that Baby Fever was in both men and women
 mahila ko sex se adhik bachche kii chaah thi, to purushon kii soch iske vipareet thi
 People were also asked what is the reason for wanting or not wanting a child
 pehla sakaaratmak kaaran tha
 For example, taking the child in his arms, taking care of his clothes and toys
 doosraa nakaaratmak bhav, masalan bacchon kaa ronaa or uskaa napkin badalanaa vagairah
 The third aspect was the question of being a child related to his education, career, wealth and social life
 professor brass ke anusaar unhen sakaaratmak pahalu or nakaaratmak pahalu dekhne vaale donon tarah ke log dekhne ko mili
 According to him, "then there were those who were affected by both positive and negative aspects and were quite confused
" bachche paidaa karne kaa lekin kaaran bana rahaa

 Bal Thackeray has written to Shiv Sainiks to show the black flag during Rahul Gandhi's visit to Maharashtra
 isse pehle bal thakare kaa bhatija or emenes pramukh raaj thakare ne kal apane bhaashan main kaha tha ki romaputra rahul gandhi us samay kahaan the jab mumbai main andolan ho rahe the
 In his speech Raj Thackeray also claimed the integrity and unity of the country at stake, claiming to be friendly to the Marathi manoos
 raaj kii belgaum jabaan baghawat kii dhamkee de rahi thi
 Raj Thackeray even talked about separating Maharashtra
 isse pehle shivasena ke kaaryakari adhyaksh uddhav thakare ne congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi par jamkar palatwaar kiya tha
 In an article printed in the Sena mouthpiece Saamna, Uddhav Thackeray had said that Rahul Gandhi insulted the heroes who died in the terrorist attack by referring to the soldiers of Bihar and UP who joined the NSG during the Mumbai attack
 uddhav thakare ne kahana tha ki hemanth karkare, vijay salskar, ashok kaamate or tukaraam omble jaise marathi vir shaheedon kaa apmaan kiya he
 It is worth mentioning that on Monday, during the address to the students in Darbhanga, Bihar, Rahul Gandhi had said that the Shiv Sena and MNS should not forget that many of the NSG commandos who had defeated the terrorists in the terror attack were from UP and Bihar Were
 party mukhpatr saamana main bal thakare ne sampadakeey main likhaa tha ki lagata he rahul ke sing nikal aae hai
 Bal Thackeray had said in his article that Rahul Gandhi has become sick due to not getting married
 rahul ne maharashtra or shaheedon kaa apmaan kiya he
 He raised the question whether Rahul will settle us in Kashmir? There was a sharp reaction in the political corridors regarding the Thackeray family's statements
 maharashtra congress ke netaa sanjay nirupam kaa kahana tha ki raaj thakare ke khilaaf bhadakau bayaan dene ke liye karrwai kii jaani chahie
 Former Law Minister Ramjethmalani says that according to the statement made by Raj Thackeray, a serious case can be made against Raj Thackeray but this is possible only when the Maharashtra government shows its intention to take action against Raj Thackeray
 kabhi dakshin bharatiyon ke khilaaf nafrat kii aag failaane vaale bal thakare marathi manus ke naam par ab uttar bharatiyon ke khilaaf jehar ugal rahe hai
 So far, his nephew Raj Thackeray, who has spread the ladder of politics by spreading hatred against North Indians, has expressed how much the nation matters before Maharashtra

 sikh dangon main congress ke kaddavar netaa rahe sajjan kumaar ko doshi tehraae jane ke baad gandhi parivaar par hamale tej ho gaye hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party did not stop the controversy over the withdrawal of Bharat Ratna from Rajiv Gandhi that Akali Supremo Sukhbir Badal has demanded from the PM that the Gandhi family names be removed from all airports and other public government sites
 iske saath hi rajeev gandhi ko diya bharat ratna waapas liya jaae
 Sukhbir Badal said that after Sajjan Kumar was sentenced to the Delhi High Court, it has now become clear that through his leaders, the Gandhi family had carried out anti-sikh riots of 1984 and the names of people associated with such families could be sent to any airport or other Government should not be on public property
 unhone kaha ki naa hi rajeev gandhi ko bharat ratna kahalaane kaa koi haq he
 Sukhbir Badal said that the way Arvind Kejriwal first passed the resolution to withdraw the Bharat Ratna given to Rajiv Gandhi from the Delhi Legislative Assembly and later reversed under Congress pressure, it is clear that Arvind Kejriwal and Aam Aadmi Party of Congress Are under pressure and there is no difference between the two
 unhone daawa kiya ki jald hi in donon partiyon kaa gathbandhan bhi hone vaala he
 Sukhbir Badal said that Captain Amarinder Singh resigned from Congress after the 1984 anti-sikh riots but now this same Captain Amarinder Singh stands in favor of Congress and Gandhi family
 isse saaf he ki captain amarinder singh ko sikhon ke hiton or sikh dharm se kuch bhi lenaa-dena nahin he unhen sirf apni mukhyamantri kii kursi se hi matlab he kyonki agar wo gandhi parivaar ke khilaaf kuch bhi bolenge to unhen mukhyamantri kii kursi se hataa diya jayega
 Earlier the Akali Dal general secretary and spokesperson Drs
 dalajit singh cheema ne kaha tha ki dilli kii adaalat dwaara 1984 ke sikh virdohi dangon ke aaropee sajjan kumaar ko aaajeevan karawas kii sajaa milane se ab sabit ho gaya he ki dangaiyon ko raajnneetik sangrakshan praapt tha
 Sajjan Kumar's statements have proved that Rajiv Gandhi was not only aware of the riots but he even said in a statement that the ground shakes when a big tree falls
 captain par bhi saadhaa nishanadow
 Daljit Singh Cheema said that Captain Amarinder Singh has repeatedly given a clean chit to the Congress for anti-sikh riots
 unhone kaha ki captain baar-baar kehete hai ki dangon ke vakt rahul gandhi bachche the lekin 22 saal ke sukhbir badal ko nirdosh nahin maanate jo us vakt america main shiksha grahan kar rahe the
 On this issue, the Akali Dal wants to call a special session of the Legislative Assembly, responding to this, the Congress has said that the Akali Dal is on the backfoot on the matter of religious texts abstinence, so the Akali leaders want to divert attention from the real issues of Punjab by taking up the issues of waste

 NC President Omar Abdullah wrote in a tweet that 'it cannot be taken as coincidence that Mehbooba Mufti was going to stake claim to form the government and the Governor dissolved the assembly

 Saifuddin Soz commented sharply
 unhone eenai se kaha, 'centre ke ishaare par rajyapal ne jo kaam kiya he, uske khilaaf mahabuuba mufti ko court janaa chahie
 The dissolution of the assembly is undemocratic and unconstitutional
 mahabuuba mufti ne rajyapal ko chitthee tabhi likhi jab unhen ensi or congress ne samarthan dene kii baat kahi
 In such a situation, the governor should give Mehbooba Mufti a chance
 'kya kaha gulam nabi aaazaad nejammu kashmir vidhansabha bhang karne ko lekar aaazaad ne aarope lagaaya ki bijepi nahin chaahati he ki unke alaava koi bhi jammu kashmir main sarkaar banaae
 This is the reason why the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly was dissolved due to fear of rumors
 gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki achaanak se vidhansabha bhang karne kii koi vajah nahin ho sakati he or jab afvaahon se dar kar vidhansabha bhang kar diya he to jald se jald chaar-paanch maheene ke andar vahaan vidhansabha chunaav karke sarkaar kaa gathan kiya jaae

 — ANI (@ani)november 21, 2018isse pehle mahabuuba mufti ne 'ajtak' se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki hamaara mukhya dhyaan 35 e or rajya ke vishesh darje ko lekar he
 The issue was raised in January
 jab main mukhyamantri thi, tab maine iskaa virodh kiya tha
 The Kashmiri people have sacrificed a lot for this
 us samay kai aise badlaav karne kii baaten thim, jo logon ke hit main nahin thi
 Mehbooba argued in defense of the three parties coming together that we have all come together only to preserve the special status of the state
 kya bhaajapa ke anya duusare dalon ke saath sarkaar banaae jane kii khabaron ke chalate pidipi-congress or neshnal conference ek saath aae hai? is sawaal par mahabuuba ne kaha ki rajya main badi party banane ke baad bijepi un partiyon ko todane kii koshish kar rahi he jinhone riyasat main badi mehnat or qurbaaniyon ke baad loktantric mulyon ko sthapit kiya tha
 To face such strength, we decided to come together
 teenon dalon main se kisne ek saath aane kii pahal kii, is sawaal par mahabuuba ne kaha ki ham teenon hi ek saath aae hai
 Like us, both parties are also concerned about the attitude towards the 35A and the Center
 teenon dalon main koun iskaa netritv karegaa, is sawaal par mahabuuba ne kaha ki philhal to pidipi iskaa netritv kar rahi he
 But we are discussing it now
 kya ensi bhi sarkaar kaa hissaa banegi yaa phir wo sirf baahar se samarthan karegi, is sawaal par mahabuuba ne kaha ki is par abhi faisla hona baaki he
 On the question of presenting the claim of Governor to form the government, Mehbooba said that we are faxing him with the letter of support of both the parties
 unhone kaha ki dekhte hai ki aage kya hota he
 What are the Legislative Assembly Equations Jammu and Kashmir Assembly has a total of 89 seats, out of which two members are nominated
 aisi sthiti main sarkaar banane ke liye 44 vidhayakon kii jarurat hoti he
 In the current situation, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has 28 seats, BJP 25 and National Conference 15 and Congress has 12 seats
 yani agar pidipi, congress or neshnal conference ek saath aate hai to aankada 55 tak pahunch rahaa he or aasaani se sarkaar kaa gathan kiya ja saktaa he

 In the annual budget of the central government, the common man used to wait to know what things the government has changed about its needs
 yani bajet ke baad aam aadmi ke liye kya sasta hua or kya mahangaa
 But since July 1, GST has been implemented in the entire country and now the common man will not be interested in the budget process of 2018 started by the central government
 aisa isliye ki ab utpaada or sevaayen par tex nirdhaarit karne kaa kaam jiesti council ke adheen he
 The GST Council is an institution headed by the Finance Minister which includes the Finance Ministers of all states
 jiesti kanoon ke tahat 1 july 2017 ke baad desh main sabhi utpaadon or sevaaon par tex nirdhaarit (indiarect tex) karne kii jimmedaari jiesti council ke paas rahegi
 It is worth noting that where the common man's eye on the annual budget was kept in the past years to know cheap and expensive, but after the GST implemented 3 months ago, the GST Council has been set three times cheaper
 lihaaja aagaamee vaarshik bajet main kendra sarkaar dwaara mahaj diarect tex- yani personal inakam tex or corporate tex ke saath-saath custom duty hi nirdhaarit kiya jayega
 Also read: 10 new things related to the coming 'new GST', know tax, tax officer and business, however, according to the provision in GST, the annual budget will see the inclusion of different products and services prescribed by the GST Council
 iske saath hi vaarshik bajet main kendra sarkaar ke vaarshik kharch ke saath-saath nae skiimon or kaaryakramon kaa lekha jokha maujuud rahegaa
 It is worth mentioning that earlier the Central Government had integrated the separate budget system of the Ministry of Railways in the annual budget
 is faisle ke chalate pichley bajet main aam aadmi ko rail bajet main nai rail gaadiyaan or nae rail root par ghoshnaa sunne ko nahin mili
 At the same time, another thing for which the common man was waiting for the annual budget is the announcement of new schemes and schemes by the central government
 lekin beete teen saal ke modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan bajet ke is mahatv ko bhi batta lag chukaa he kyonki sarkaar kii zyaadaatar skim or yojanaon ko bajet ke aage-peeche laanch kiya gaya he
 The budget has been used only to provide funds for these schemes
 gauratlab he ki kendra sarkaar ne bajet pesh karne kii taarikh main bhi bade pherbadal kiye hai
 Previously, where the General Budget was presented on February 28, last year, this tradition was abolished and the Budget was presented on February 1
 ab kendra sarkaar kii taiyaari vitt varsh main badlaav karne kii he
 With this change, the financial year will be changed from april-march to january-december
 lihaaja aisa karne ke liye yah jaruri ho jayega ki kendra sarkaar bajet kii prakriya ko agast-sitambar maheene se shuru karte hue november tak puraa kar sake
 In such a situation, the importance of the annual budget has reduced for the common man in the last few years and in the coming days it will not be more than just government expenditure and income report

 Why did the BJP forget Goa, Meghalaya and Manipur Meanwhile, senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, who is camping in Karnataka, has said that why did the BJP remember morality in Karnataka itself? Why did he forget morality in Goa
 manipur or meghalaya main bhi unhen naitikta yaad nahin ai? teenon rajyon main congress sabase badi party thi
 Despite this, the BJP formed the government there
 kya us samay ve naitikta bhul gaye the? us samay jod-tod ke saath sarkaar banaai gai thi
 Now he is missing morality in Karnataka itself
 2002 kaa diya havalasanvaidhanik sthiti kaa udhaaharan dete hue aaazaad ne 2002 kaa vakya bataaya
 Referring to the role of the governor, Azad said that Congress was the number two party in the 2002 elections in Jammu and Kashmir
 sabase badi party neshnal conference bani thi, jabaki pidipi tisare number par thi
 In such a situation, when we went to the governor to claim to form the government, the governor refused to give us the oath
 unhone kaha ki chunki aap number do kii party hai, lihaaja ham aapako shapath ke liye nahin bula sakate
 If number two and three i
e
 Congress and PDP come together by writing about support, then you can form a government
 iske baad maine tatkaaleen pidipi pramukh mufti mohammad said sahab se baat kii
 After that i became the Chief Minister
 sarkaar bani to jedies kaa mukhyamantriazad ne kaha ki aaj congress or jedies ne rajyapal ko chitthee likhakar bhej di he
 We have told them that we have the highest number
 bijepi 104 par he, jabaki hamaare paas sabhi milakar 117 siten hai
 We have told the JDS that if the government is formed then we will support them
 mukhyamantri jedies kaa hi hoga
 It is not right to say anything more than this
 is bare main shapath ke baad baat kii jaaegi
 Taking support in the national interest, Azad said that in 1996, with the support of the Congress, Deve Gowda became Prime Minister
 kai dfa ham logon ne ek-duusare kaa samarthan liya he
 This is not new
 rashtriya hit main ham log aisa karte rahete hai
 In 2019 too, Azad said that this alliance of ours will not be for just one year, but for five years
 2019 main bhi saath chunaav ladane ke sawaal par aaazaad ne kaha ki jab ham sarkaar saath chalaayenge to 2019 main alag-alag kyon ladenge
 We will fight together
