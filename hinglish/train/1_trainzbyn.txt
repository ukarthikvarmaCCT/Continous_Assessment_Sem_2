 (taaliyon kii gadgadahat)'' 11 aktubar, 2014 ko lokanayak jai prakaash narayan kii jayanti par saansad adarsh gram yojana (esaejivai) ko launch karte samay pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane 28 minute ke ojasvi bhaashan main yah baat kahi
 In fact, the Prime Minister was giving an example that if a village has to provide nutritious food for 25 pregnant women, then it takes so much time to work in the government mode, whereas under SAGY, when the villagers themselves decide, this work will be very easy Will be done from jaahir he, shrotaaon kii taaliyon main yahi harshadhvani chhipi thi ki aakhirkaar desh ke 5,000 se adhik gaanvon kaa daura karne kaa daawa karne vaale pradhanmantri ne gramin bharat ke liye lalaphitaashahee se mukt ek abhinav yojana kaa khaakaa pesh kar diya he
 And coincidentally, when this news is being written exactly six months after the Prime Minister's speech, SAGY is stumbling on the same governmental process which Modi sarcasted
 yojana kaa sanchaalan karne vaale gramin vikaas mantralay main esaejivai ke diarector dow
 From what Kushal Pathak told India Today, the sluggish move of the project is self-evident, "SAGY is currently in the process of preparing the Village Development Plan (VDP)
" gaanvon main vikaas ke kaary to agast 2015 se shuru honge
 These works will be completed by the end of 2016
 '' (dekhie baatcheet) isi bhaashan main pradhanmantri ne yah kaha tha ki agar saansadon kii tarj par rajya sarkarein bhi vidhayak adarsh gram yojana taiyaar kar len to desh main har saal 7,000 se 8,000 aise adarsh gaanv taiyaar ho jaaenge jo apane pados ke gaanvon ke liye misaal honge
 In this way, the ideal villages will come into the country
 lekin esaejivai kii website par prakashit aankadon ke mutabik kaam hona to dur abhi tak sabhi saansadon ne apane adarsh gaanv kaa chayan bhi nahin kiya he
 Such mps include 55 Lok Sabha and 62 Rajya Sabha mps
 jin saansadon ne gaanv kaa chayan kar liya he, unka rishta bhi apane gaanv ke saath baraae naam kaa he
 In this news from the report card of Adarsh villages, it is evident that a minister like bjp's Kalraj Mishra and Dushyant Singh, son of Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje MP, have not visited the village till date
 rajnath singh or general ve
 K
 singh jaise mantri ek baar gram darshan kii aupchaarikta nibhaa chuke hai
 Actually, the problem of mps is that no separate money has been given for the scheme
 yojana ko lagu karne kii guidelins bhi march main jaakar puri hui hai
 On the other hand, the villagers feel that if such a big minister has adopted the village, then now there will be prosperity all around
 aise main saansad ke paas le-dekar apni saansad nidhi bachati he, agar vah ise ek gaanv par kharch kar degaa to sansadeey kshetra ke baaki ke 1,000 gaanv or darjanabhar kasbon main vah kya kharch karegaa
 Naresh Aggarwal, the Rajya Sabha MP of the Samajwadi Party from Uttar Pradesh, cut it off that he returned the village named Sadai Behta in Hardoi
 agarwal kii do took suniye, ''ye yojana to gaanvon main jhagada kara degi
 If there is to be development, then all the villages should be
 duusare, yojana main paisa to he nahin, vikaas kahaan se hoga
 "due to the strong opposition party, Agarwal can get rid of the body from Adarsh village, but those who chant the namo-namo and win the election do not have this facility
" aise main giriraaj singh or uma bharti jaise mantriyon ne yah kaat nikaali he ki pehle se acchhee haalat vaale gaanv ko chun liya jaae, taaki thode gud main hi khub meetha ho jaae
 Yes, mps like Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh have adopted Badhaal village and started working there
 or rahi baat pradhanmantri ke gaanv kii to vahaan vikaas ke kaary nijee companiyon kii dariyaadilii se dhadadhad chal rahe hai
 The rest of the mps are talking about step-by-step development from the fixed government process
 or unka sochna galat bhi nahin he
 SAGY does not have its own money, so the government has made arrangements to ensure that part of the more than a dozen schemes already running by different ministries are for Adarsh village
 inamen se takreeban sabhi yojanaayen upie sarkaar ke jamaane kii hai
 Yes, some old schemes have been named as new
 jaise rajeev gandhi gramin vidyutikaran mishan ko ab dinadayal upaadhyaay gram jyoti yojana kaha jaataa he
 The Ministry of Rural Development changed the guidelines of these schemes from December 2014 to March 2015 and linked them to SAGY
 yani asal main yojana kii ruparekha banane kaa kaam hi march ke madhya tak chalata rahaa
 That is why Jyotiraditya Scindia, a Congress leader and energy minister in the UPA government, challenges, despite adopting the model village in his constituency Guna, "yes, i have selected the village
" ab vikaas modiji karaaen
 Only Modiji can run the scheme without money
 ye saansad adarsh gram yojana nahin he, adarsh frod yojana he
 "scindia claims that even though the government may talk about linking the scheme with various schemes, in reality the government is only cutting the money of each scheme
 mantriyon ke adarsh gram main abhi khaakaa hi ho rahaa taiyaryojna kii badahaali dekhne ke liye zyada dur jane kii jarurat nahin he
 The story of Mirpur Hindu village in Ghaziabad parliamentary constituency adjoining the capital Delhi is similar
 yah videsh rajyamantri general ve
 K
 singh kaa adarsh gaanv he
 Buffaloes are tied up in the village government sub-health center and panchayat building
 up-swasthya centre main itane varshon se koi doctor nahin aayaa to ek beghar muslim ne parivaar ise apana sthaayee ashiana bana liya
 When we talk about the development of the people of the village, their first question is, "our first and last demand is that the proposed land fill (garbage throwing place) scheme in the village be scrapped
 '' esaejivai main mahila shashaktikaran kii khub baaten kahi gai hai, lekin gaanv kii pradhan rekha bansal kii jagah unke sasur or purv pradhan shishpal bansal hi baat karte hai
 He says, "after the adoption of the ideal village of the minister, we are waiting for the activities of the Panchayat to be combined with the works that are in this scheme
 philhal intjaar jari he
 '' Press advisor to the minister S
 pi
 Singh said, "the master plan of the village is in the works
 shauchalayon kaa nirmaan shuru kara diya gaya he
 Solar plant work for drinking water and 24-hour power will start soon
 '' gaanv vaale is baat kii tasdik karte hai ki gaanv ab bhi usee surat main he, jisamen god lene se pehle tha
 They are sure that despite the large-scale destruction of the village in the hailstorm, the government records do not show the crop being destroyed in the village
 aise senapati kaa kya phayda jo barabaad kisaanon kii fariyaad hi upar tak na pahunchaa sake
 On the other hand, Home Minister Rajnath Singh has so far been able to build a bank branch, small post office and toilets in some houses in Benti village of his parliamentary constituency Lucknow
 gaanv ab bhi swasthya or shiksha kii buniyadi suvidhaon ke liye jujh rahaa he
 Meanwhile, MSME Minister Kalraj Mishra has adopted Payasi village in Deoria parliamentary constituency
 is gaanv ke bare main kahawat he- sau baar kaashi or ek baar payaasi
 Yet the Minister has not come to the village even once, nor has any work been done at the ground level
 haalanki, mishra ke saansad pratinidhi vijay kumaar dube kehete hai, ''ab tak 40 vibhaagon ke adhikari baithak kar chuke hai
 567 toilets have been approved in the village and 273 women have been selected under the PEP scheme
 '' udhar agra se saansad or kendriya maanav sansaadhan vikaas rajya mantri ramshankar katheria apane adarsh gaanv pilkhatra main ab tak sirf paanch sabmarsible pump lagava sake hai
 "there are plans to build an inter college, a hospital and toilets in every house in the village," says Katheria
 ''nijee companiyon ne chamkaaya modi kaa jayapurye to rahi baat baaki saansad or mantriyon kii lekin pradhanmantri narendra modi ke sansadeey kshetra varanasi ke adarsh gram jayapur kii baat alag he
 The date is April 13 and it is three in the afternoon
 jayapur main sadak ke kinare khaali padi bench par narendra modi kii kahi sookhti likhi he, 'sapane, ' jo sone nahin dete
 "just behind these benches, Naunihal, sitting on the sackcloth lying on the ground, was engrossed in weaving his dreams of his golden future with his book-copy
 badahaal sarkari shiksha vyavastha ke shikaar nursery se pehali kaksha tak padhane vaale ye bachche gaanv main chalane vaale ek nijee koching centre main apni buniyadi shiksha kaa kakehara sikh rahe the
 How ironic that a company from Gujarat set up more than a hundred benches in Jayapur, but not a single chair came to the fate of children
 gaanv main narendra modi kii tasveeron se pata or bhagava rang main ranga chamchamata bas stop ban gaya he
 a small bus has also started going to the main road
 gaanv main solar lamp aa gaye hai
 But none of these works is with the government but private companies of Gujarat
 pichley varsh jayapur ko god lene ke baad pehali baar 7 november ko yahaan pahunch vikaas kii aupchaarik shuruyaat karne vaale pradhanmantri narendra modi ke gaanv main nijee companiyon ne apane khayraton kii jhadi laga di he
 The special thing is that most of these companies are associated with Gujarat in some way
 gujarat ke navsari se saansad or jayapur main modi ke pratinidhi chandrakant raghunatha patil kehete hai, ''gujarat main upi kii tulana main aadhe se kam daam main saamaan mil jaataa he to vahaan kii companiyon kii madad lene main koi harj nahin he
 Not only a Gujarat company, a Rohanian company in Varanasi has also offered to start employment programs in Jayapur
 '' gaanv ke pashchimi chor par ek nijee company ne sabhi 14 musahar pariwaron ke liye makaan banawaye hai
 An Ahmedabad-based company has pioneered the construction of 450 toilets in the village
 gaanv main bane bas stand ke thik peeche atyaadhunik solar pump banakar taiyaar hai jise 5,000 litre pani kii kshamta vaali tank se joda gaya he
 Soon a private company will make a two lakh liter capacity water tank in Jayapur, as well as a system of providing free water to all the houses in the village through pipes
 jayapur main nijee companiyon kii lagaataar bad rahi sakriyata ke bich sarkari kshetra main ek nayaa badlaav nae bainkon kii aamad se hua he
 In the last six months, branches of Union Bank, Syndicate Bank and State Bank have opened in this village

 "carpet Export Promotion Council" of the Ministry of Textiles, Government of India has opened a handloom training center for women in a vacant building in Jayapur
 jayapur main badahaal pade iklaute sarkari primary vidhyalay kii kisi ne ab tak sud nahin lee he
 The village head Durgavati blames the SP government in the state, "DM has come to the village many times but he has not started any government scheme in the village so far
 '' haalanki, varanasi ke jiladhikari pranjal yadav kehete hai, ''jile ke kisi bhi gaanv yaa kshetra se koi bhi bhedbhaav nahin he
 "by the way, Modi also said in an October 11 speech," In the process of idealizing a village, mps will know what are the flaws in government schemes and how they can be overcome
 jab ve saansad sansad main in samasyaon ko uthaaenge to kitne bhi bahumat kii sarkaar ho use unki baat sunani hogi
 This will lead to better plans for the development of villages
 '' ab khud pradhanmantri ne to nijee companiyon kii madad se apane gaanv ko chamakaa liya he, lekin baaki saansad yojanaon kii bhul-bhulaiya main chakkar laga rahe hai
 People do not mean the finer details of the plan and neither do they want an ideal village by budget provisions, which is still waiting
 (saath main kumaar harsh, siraaj kuraishi, samir garg, mahesh sharma, ashok kumaar priyadarshi or piyush pachak) The warnings about melting of most of the Himalayan glaciers by 2035 due to climate change have been called misleading after the IPCC accepted serious scientific mistakes
 bharat ke rajendra pachori kii adhyakshata main jalwaayu parivartan kii antar sarkari samiti (ipisisi) ne do varsh pehle ek vyapak report pesh kii thi
 The report cited the latest and most extensive research regarding global warming
 iskaa mukhya sandesh yah tha ki vishwa ke glacier teji se pigal rahe hai or 2035 tak himalay ke glaciaron kaa astitv samaapt ho jayega
 The Sunday Times reported on Sunday that a few days ago scientists admitted that their global warming report was based on a news story from the popular science journal 'new Scientist'
 yah newsstory ipisisi kii 2007 kii report se aath varsh pehle prakashit hui thi
 It has also emerged in this report that the news story of New Scientist was also based on a short telephony interview of Indian scientist Syed Hasnain who was teaching at Jawaharlal Nehru University at that time
 akhbaar ke anusaar hasanan ne iske baad kaha he ki unka daawa ek anumaan tha or is sambandh main koi aupchaarik anusandhan nahin kiya gaya tha
 If confirmed, this would be a serious failure in relation to climate change research
 jalwaayu parivartan ke sambandh main vishwa ko sarvshereshth vaigyanik paraamarsh mil sake iske liye ipisisi kii sthapana kii gayi thi
 Earlier, this report on the Himalayas was criticized for not being up to the mark on scientific evidence but was rejected by Rajendra Pachauri and last week the IPCC refused to comment on the report
 lambey samay tak ipisisi ke nishkarshon se naaraaz chal rahe trent vishvavidhyalay ke bhugol vigyaani graham kogale ke netritv main kaam kar rahe vaigyanikon ke dal ne is bhul kaa pataa lagaaya tha
 Koggle discovers that the IPCC claim is only a re-mention of the 'new Scientist' report, and he then contacts journalist Fred Pearce who took the actual interview
 piers ne iske baad phir se hasanan kaa saakshaatkaar kiya jinhone kaha ki 1999 main kii gayi tippaniyan anumaanon par aadhaarit thi
 Pearce published the updated information in 'new Scientist'
 ek bhartiya patrika main hasanan kii report prakashit hone ke baad piers ne 1999 main vaigyanik se sampark kiya tha

 Daroga Bachhu Singh, who was the initial investigator in the Aarushi case, is now trapped in a murder case
 aapako bataate hai, puraa maamla kya he
 In fact, in Ghaziabad's police station Kavinagar, a girl was reported missing in the first week of December
 police ne us ladki kaa pataa lagane ke liye fouran apni tiimon ko gajiabad ke alag alag hisson kii taraf ravaanaa kar diya
 But even after searching all the places, the police could not find any slight clue
 police ne tafteesh ko aage badhaane ke liye us ladki or ladki ke parivaar ke tamaam logon ke mobile ko bhi khangaalana shuru kiya
 While the police was rinsing the mobiles of the girl's family, her eyes were fixed on a blurred picture
 gharavaalon se police ko ye to pataa chal hi gaya ki mobile par dikhne vaali shakl un logon ko bhi kuch roj pehle hi dikhaai deni shuru hui thi
 And then that face often appeared at his house
 darasal tasviir main wo cheharaa us gumshuda ladki kii ek saheli kaa tha
 And whatever the family said about that friend, the police did not find anything strange
 
 
 phir bhi police mobile main kaid us ladki kii talash main nikal padi
 Now the challenge before the police was to find two girls, which was to find in Ghaziabad with a population of 50 lakh, it was like finding a needle in a dark cell for the police
 lihaaja police us tasviir ko haath main lekar gumshuda ladki kii saheli kii talash main bhi nikal padi
 The effort of the police, running day and night on the streets of Ghaziabad, finally paid off and soon the face was found on her hands, which she was wandering at the rate by taking the mobile in her hands
 us ladki ke saath uskaa pati bhi tha
 The girl's name is Rashmi and she lives in Ghaziabad with her husband Amarpal
 peshey se patrkaar rashmi kii kuch vakt pehle hi us ladki se dosti hui thi, jo is vakt gumshuda he or jiskaa pataa jaanane ke liye hi rashmi tak pahunchnaa police ko behad jaruri lag rahaa tha
 Rashmi had done the job of getting the job, the police started the questioning of Rashmi to find out the missing girl's address
 rashmi ne police ko us gumshuda ladki se hui apni dosti ke bare main sab kuch bataaya
 He also revealed that he also promised to get Rashmi a job
 lekin achaanak wo ladki laapata ho gai
 When the police could not get anything from Rashmi, she intended to expose Rashmi's husband
 kyonki police amarpal kaa ateet acchhee tarah jaanati thi
 Therefore, the police dealt a bit harshly with Amarpal
 
 
 police kii ye koshish kaamyaab rahi
 Amarpal broke down due to the police attitude, and then when he opened his mouth, a story of murder, along with the face of a uniform was revealed
 katl usee gumshuda ladki kaa, jisaki talash main police dar dar bhatak rahi thi
 Amarpal also revealed who hatched the plot and how it was then executed
 amarpal ko bachchu singh ne di thi supaariarpal ne police ko bataaya ki is khaufnak katl kii sajeesh kaa sara taana bana kisi or ne nahin balki gajiabad main tainaat rah chuke daaroga bachchu singh ne rachaa tha
 On opening Amarpal's mouth, the police immediately arrested Rashmi and Amarpal as well as Bachu Singh and his accomplice soldier Vinesh
 aapako bataa den ki bachchu singh uttar pradesh police kaa vahi daaroga he jisane aarushi or hemraj ke katl ke cese main badi ahm bhoomika adaa kii thi
 In May 2008, at the time of the murder of Aarushi and Hemraj, Bachu Singh was posted in Sector 20 police station of Noida
 or usee ne desh kii sabase badi murder mistry kii shuruuaati tahakikat kaa kaam kiya tha
 Later, he also became an important witness in that case of Bachhu Singh murder
 us gumshuda ladki ke katl kii sajeesh isi bachchu singh ne apane ek hawaldaar ke saath rachi thi
 
 or wo bhi us vakt jab wo bagpat kii tatiri chaowkee par tainaat tha
 At the behest of Bachchu Singh, the soldier, who worked under him, along with Vinesh, weaved all the fabric of that girl's slaughter and then Vinesh gave the slaughter to the professional killer Amarpal
 ladki ko sajeesh ke jaal main kaise fansaane ke liye amarpal kii patni rashmi kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 Rashmi first befriended the girl and, on the pretext of getting money and a job, called her to meet her at the Ghaziabad bus stand
 taarikh thi 30 november
 Amarpal was already present at the bus stand with one of his companions
 donon us ladki ko bike par bithakar aligarh ke paas le gaye or vahiin dupattey se galaa dabaakar uski hatya kar di or laash ko nahar main thikaane lagaakar vahaan se faraar ho gaye
 And the reason for the murder? Actually this story starts with the love story of Bachu Singh's son and a girl
 bachchu singh kaa betaa tarun shaadi kaa jhansa dekar ladki kaa yon shaushan kar rahaa tha, or jab isane shaadi ke liye dabaav daalaa to tarun ne shaadi karne se manaa kar diya
 Desperate from all sides, this girl filed a rape case against Tarun in March 2013
 bete ke khilaaf balaatkaar kaa maamla thane main darj hua to bachchu singh ko ye baat gavaara nahin hui
 So, he pressurized the girl many times to compromise
 is bich bachchu singh kaa tabadalaa bagpat kittiri chaowkee par ho gaya
 Troubled over the arrest of his boy, Bachu Singh told his problem to the soldier posted in the post and the same soldier got Bachu Singh to meet the betel nut killer Amarpal
 ladki ke gaayab hone kaa puraa cese blind tha or police ke paas suraag ke naam par keval ek phone number tha jisase aakhri baar uske number par phone aayaa tha
 It was revealed in the police investigation that the number was activated only a week before the incident
 tab police ke haath doosraa suraag rashmi kii wo dhundhlee photo kii shakl main mila
 
 
 And then the picture of the entire plot was cleared

 However, Tendulkar had to work hard even before writing a letter for his wife
 unhone muskaraate hue kaha, 'cricket gend ko hit karnaa mere liye natural tha lekin anjali ko letters likhte samay main yah jaanch karata rahata tha ki main kya likh rahaa hum
 Tendulkar said during a program to promote handwriting here, "in those days there were no mobiles and the only means of communication were landline phones or letters
 maine patr likhane shuru kiye
 i started by writing letters to my parents and later some letters for wife (anjali)
 ' tendulkar kehete hai ki anjali ke liye khat likhnaa batting karne se kathin kaam tha
 He recalled how his parents taught him to hold a pen and write
 tendulkar ne kaha, 'iske baad jab main parivaar se dur rahata tha to maine apane mata-pita or baad main patni ke liye patr likhane shuru kiye the
 Tendulkar said that generally the handwriting of doctors is not clean but Doctor Anjali was an exception in this case
 unhone kaha, 'unki likhaawat bahut sundar he
 Anyone can get inspired by seeing him
 ' or sabase kharaab likhaawat kiski thi, is par tendulkar ne kaha, 'aap amuman sabase acchhee chizon par dhyaan dete hai'
 Talking about the life after retirement, Tendulkar said, 'life is beautiful
 mujhe apane bacchon ke saath samay bitaane kaa paryaapt samay mil rahaa he
 i don't play anymore
 kabhi kabhaar apane bete ke saath khel letaa hum
 Sachin also said that he is writing autobiography now
 sachin se jab iske bare main poocha gaya, to unhone kaha, 'haa, main likh rahaa hum, lekin is bare main uchit samay aane par jaankaree duungaa
 Tendulkar arrived here to promote handwriting through the efforts of a private company, when reporters told him more about Sachin, he said that if i tell everything right here, then no one will read my book

 The heroes of this Canadian victory were Henry Osinde and Delhi-born captain Ashish Bagai and Ludhiana-born Jimmy Hansra
 osinde ne jahaan 26 ran ke evaj main chaar wicket lekar kenyan sheersh kram ko tahas nahas kiya vahiin osinde or bagai ne visham paristhitiyon main chauthe wicket ke liye 126 ran kii saajhedaari kii jo vishwa cap main canada kii taraf se kisi bhi wicket ke liye sabase badi bhagidaari he
 With Osinde's brilliance, half of Kenya's team had returned to the pavilion for 57 runs, but managed to score 198 runs with half-centuries from Tanmay Mishra (51) and Thomas Odoyo (51)
 canada ne bhi 48 ran par teen wicket ganvaa diye the lekin iske baad pehali gend par hi jeevandaan paane vaale hansra (70) or bagai (naabad 64) ne sahajata se team kii naiya paar lagaayi
 Canada 45
 3 over main paanch wicket par 199 ran banaakar chauthe match main apana khaataa kholaa
 This is Kenya's fourth consecutive defeat
 canada kii is toornament main sabase badi kamajori ballebaaji rahi he lekin aaj vah hansra or bagai kii badaulat vah apni is kamajori se paar paane main safal rahaa
 Canada gambled to open the innings with their trump card Rizwan Cheema, who scored two fours and a six after being saved through a referral on the first ball, but he was bowled in an effort to advance to the ball of Eljah Otino
 kenya ko yah chook mahangi padi or hansra ne iske baad kai aakshark shaat khele
 He hit four boundaries off the last two balls of the same over from Ngoche and later hit sixes on Jimmy Commande and Steve Ticolo to complete the first half-century of his ODI career off 74 balls
 pichley 20 vanade maichon main 50 se adhik kii ausat se ran banane vaale bagai ne phir se dabaav main dhary se ballebaaji karne kii apni kaabiliyat kaa jaandaar namoona pesh kiya
 He enjoyed the batting of Hansra first and took his two innings to extend his innings
 baad main unhone nemiyah oriyambo kii gend par chaukaa jadkar van de main apana 15waan or vishwa cap main pehla ardhashatak puraa kiya
 The batting powerplay again proved fatal for the frozen batsman and in the first over of Canada, Hansra lost the wicket, who played 99 balls and hit seven fours and two sixes
 powerple main canada ne tyson gordan (3) kaa wicket bhi ganvaaya lekin bagai jame rahe jinhone team kii tarah se vijayi chaukaa bhi jadaa 
 Bagai played 97 balls and hit seven fours
 isse pehle tas jitkar pehle ballebaaji ke liye utre kenya kii pari mishra or odoyo ke ird gird hi gumti rahi jo paanch wicket par mishra ne is bich captain jimi commande (22) ke saath chathe wicket ke liye 52 or odoyo ke saath saatven wicket ke liye 57 ran kii saajhedaari kii
 Osinde caught opener Maurice Ouma in the second slip on the second ball of the innings and then scattered the wickets of Siren Waters (2)
 david obuya (2) bhi adhik der nahin tik paye or osinde kii gend unke balle ko chuumati hui bagai ke dastaanon main samaa gayi
 Collins Obuya (31) also bowled after playing some good shots in an attempt to play Baidwan's ball without getting in line
 steve tikolo (12) bhi jab adhik der tak nahin tik paye to lagane laga ki canada jald hi kenyan pari sametakar match ko ekatarfa bana degaa lekin mumbai main janmen 24 varshiya ballebaaj mishra ne aise maukey par sanyat bhari pari kheli
 Mishra found a good partner as a commande and the two did not let any wickets fall for 14 overs
 bharat main ranjai trophy khilne vaale leg spinner balaji raav ne commande ko out karke yah saajhedaari todi
 Commande could not use the steps correctly on the ball taking the turn and bat on it
 baaki kaam bagai ne kar diya
 After this, Canada also had to wait about 13 overs for the next success
 mishra van de main apana chauthaa ardhashatak puraa karne ke turant baad pavilion laut gayi
 John Davison, who came as a change, dissolved Mishra's concentration on the first ball
 vah gend kii flite ko samajhane main naakaam rahe or midaaf par aasaan kaich de baithe
 Ossinde took the fourth wicket in the form of Nemiyyah Odiambo but Odoyo persisted
 unhone davisan par long aaf main khubasurat chakka jamaaya or phir aakhri over main apana aathvaan ardhashatak puraa kiya

 Facebook merged these two brothers about a week ago
 donon bhaionlinegem khelte hue aapas main mili
 The face of both of them is so similar that one of the brothers quarreled over chatting as to why my photo was posted
 usne duusare bhai par aarope bhi lagaaya ki usne photo kaa istemaal karfarji profilabana rakhi he
 But what was revealed next was surprising
 ek jalandhar to doosraa ludhiana main rahata thaye kahani hemanth or sivam naam ke do bhaaiyon kii he
 Surprisingly, the two brothers were separated from each other since 2001, but the distance between the two cities in which they lived was just 67 kilometers
 hemanth jalandhar main rah rahaa tha or sivam ludhiana main
 To understand this story one must first return to 2001
 jalandhar main peshey se patrkaar arjuna sharma or unki patni anjali ko ek bachche ko god lenaa tha
 They find out through an intermediary that a divorced woman gave birth to two twin sons on 14 September 2001
 mahila donon bacchon kii jimmedaari nahin uthaa sakati thi isliye ek bachche ko god dena chaahati thi
 The moderator talked about this and Arjun Sharma got the baby boy
 tab bachche ko god lene ke niyam itane kade nahin the jitne ki ab hai
 The child was named Hemant
 arjuna or anjali ne is baat kii puri koshish kii ki hemanth ko nahin pataa chale ki wo god liya hua he
 At the same time, his twin brother Shivam kept up with his mother Meenakshi
 hemanth ke bartaav main badlaav aa gayalambe samay tak aisa hi chalata rahaa
 But about a year before today, Hemant came to know from someone that he is not adopted by Arjun and Anjali, but is adopted
 tabhi se hemanth ke bartaav main badlaav aa gaya
 Hemant, who was very fast in studies, started losing his mind even after studying
 wo har dam puri sachai jaanane kii koshish karne laga
 After all, Arjun and Anjali had to talk about adopting Hemant
 lekin unhen ye khud bhi nahin pataa tha ki hemanth kii sagi maa or uskaa judawaan bhai ab kahaan rahete hai
 On the other hand, Shivam was living in Ludhiana with mother Meenakshi
 use bhi judawaan bhai hone kii baat auron se hi pataa chali thim
 Shivam also used to ask mother Meenakshi to find twin brother
 sanyog se is saal 9 farvari ko vah din bhi aa gaya jab donon bhaaiyon ne fasebuk ke madhyam se ek duusare ko pahchaan liya
 The two talked to each other through video calling while playing online games
 iske baad donon bhaaiyon se rahaa nahin gaya or sivam agle din hi hemanth se milane jalandhar aa gaya
 The two brothers are very happy to meet together
 anjali kii ankhen bhi chhalchala aati hai
 She says that she now has two sons
 iees adhikari bananaa chaahate hamerjun or anjali kaa yahi kahana he ki hemanth or sivam donon pard likhakar achche insaan bane or bade hokar naam kamaayen
 When the two brothers, Hemant and Shivam, met together, they shared many similar things and habits
 jaise jalandhar main ek baar hemanth ne apni kalai par blade maaraa tha to ludhiana main sivam ne bhi aisa hi kiya tha
 Both love hard rice and chicken
 inaki sari activities bhi ek jaisi hi hai
 Both brothers want to grow up to become IAS officers
 halaat ne donon bhaaiyon ke sarnem jarur badal die hai, jahaan hemanth sharma he to sivam chopra
 Both brothers now have two mothers
 inaki jindagi main aage kya badlaav aate hai, ye to philhal tay nahin, lekin abhi ye donon ek-duusare ke saath zyada se zyada vakt bitaana chaahate hai
 Saeed said, 'I want to tell India that i will continue to support the Kashmiris
 isse koi fark nahin padataa ki vahaan kya museebataan hai
 India wants us to stop raising voices for Kashmiris
 vah pakistan sarkaar par dabaav bana rahaa he
 i want to tell Pakistan that the diplomacy released behind the scenes has only damaged the Kashmir issue

 Everyone is convinced of the success of Kalam and everyone wants to succeed like him in life
 magar kalam kii is kitaab ko padhakar lagata he ki kya us safalataa ko paaneke liye har koi unke jaisaa dhairyavan ho saktaa he
 In this book, Kalam has written a journey from Rameswaram to his Delhi

 But Kalam is a sailor who has a great ability to catch the depth of water and wind

 in ‘when i Failed’, a part of the book Kalam

 Referring to an incident at the t (madras Institute of Technology), the professor did not like the design of a fighter aircraft built after his day-to-day hard work
 jiske baad us professor ne kaha tha aaj shuukravaar kii dopaher he or main somvaar kii shaam tak puure vinyas kaa aarekh dekhnaa chahta hum
 If you don't do this, your scholarship will be terminated
 jiske baad kalam ne din-raat ek karke us project ko tay samay seemaa main puraa kar dikhaaya tha
 Kalam's relationship is as strong with science as it is with literature and society
 isi vajah se kalam keval vaigyanik hi nahinhain balki unke paas aadhunik bharat ko lekar ek vijan bhi he, jo unhen anya bharatiyavaigyanikon se alag karata he
 Why Read Kalam has written his autobiography in the book very honestly
 kitaab ko padhate hue yah bilkul mahasoos nahin hota ki yah sachhee kahani desh ke raashtrapati kii he
 Rather, we experience the life of Kalam as a common citizen
 vah apni safalataa-asafalataa kaa zikr apnenijee jivan ke prasangon se zyada karte hai
 If Kalam continues to inspire, then definitely read
 un chaatro ko bhi yah kitaab pasand aegi jo kariyar ke kshetra main ek sakaaratmak 'push' kii talash main he
 Why not read this book is not for you if you do not like to read anything except for flat-out stories and jokes
 yah ek gambhir kitaab he, padhate hue soche jane kii maang karti he
 If you want to learn some important basic lessons along with being successful in the race of life, then this book will fulfill your wish

 The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed the Tamil Nadu government's decision to release the culprits of the Rajiv Gandhi assassination and said that the central government will take a final decision in the matter

 Some decisions should be left on time
 In 2016, even an average educated person would agree that a small family is happy, but in the early '70s, when Indira and Sanjay Gandhi were imposing sterilization, the picture might be off the note
 It must have been like a chaos
 itihaas ne indira-sanjay ko khalanaayak darj kiya lekin parivaar niyojan jaruri mana gaya
 In order to stop black money, the decision to make the economy disabled for some time is to be given at the end of time, but at present, this decision is full of scatter and chaos, although in this uproar there are also signs of reconstruction
 philhal bharat kisi vittiya aapadaa yaa bainkon kii tabaahi se prabhavit desh (haal main greece) kii tarah najar aane laga he, jahaan bank va atm band hai, lambii katare hai or log simit maatra main nakad lene or kharch karne ko majaboor hai
 In a country where a very large economy runs on cash, 50 percent of adult people have nothing to do with banks and big notes have 80 percent share in cash exchange, then the most used notes are suddenly closed for some time
 It will only be a destruction Especially when the Reserve Bank's note printing capabilities are limited and dependent on imported instruments
 vaise is afratfari kaa kul kissa yah he ki sarkaar ko nae dizin ke note jari karne the
 As part of international consensus on attempts to stop fake currency, the Reserve Bank had completed the technology mobilization by the end of last year with the approval of secure design (bleed lines, new way of printing numbers)
 nae noton ko rigerv bank ke nae governor (rajan ke baad) ke hastakshar ke saath november 2016 main jari kiya janaa tha
 2,000 in this
 kaa nayaa note bhi tha
 In the same sequence, after the confirmation of the Pakistani hand in counterfeit notes, the government had also decided to reduce the dependence on imports to 50 per cent in three years on techniques and equipment to secure the currency
 nae dizin ke note jari karne ke liye puraani karency ko band (dimonetise) nahin kiya jaataa, bas nae note kramash: system main utaar die jate hai
 But the government stopped the notes, which many of the results did not even own
 museebaton kaa hisaab-kitaab1
 Total cash from closing of big notes (rs
 16 lakh crore)
 ) main lagbhag 14 lakh karod ru
 The shortfall means that the government invited the immediate recession by stopping most of the demand in one stroke
 karency kii aapurti saamaanya hone main lanbaa vakt lagata he, isliye mandi va bekaari se ubarne main or zyada vakt lagegaa
 2
 koi bhi desh saamaanya sthiti main apni karency (legal tender) ke istemaal par sharten nahin lagaataa, masalan, dawa kharid sakate hai par roti nahin
 This is against the principle of currency operations
 aisa tabhi hota he jab desh kii saakh dub rahi ho
 Therefore, the rupee has weakened in the foreign exchange market
 3
 The Reserve Bank's autonomy has been hampered by the decision, which is administered and decided by the Reserve Bank
 is faisle ke tareeke or taiyaariyon ko beshak bisuriye lekin kaale dhan kii takat ko kamatar mat ankiye
 Haven't seen people get barely two hours after the announcement, but at the same time, there were queues at the gold shops
 note band hone ke baavjood hawala bazaar main abhootpurv oonchi keemton par sone or dollar ke saude hote rahe, jinhen rokane ke liye iskar vibhaag ko chhapemari kerani padi
 The record of recent attempts to curb black money has not been very successful
 bainkon, property va julari par nakad len-dein main pan number kii anivaaryta se bainkon main jamaa kam ho gaya or bazaar main nakadi bad gai
 The black money declaration waiver schemes did not bring very enthusiastic results
 antat: sarkaar ne apratyaashit vikalp kaa istemaal kiya, jisase kareeb teen lakh karod ru
 Black cash is expected to run out
 iske saath hi nae note lene ke liye nakadi lekar bank ja rahe logon par iskar vibhaag kii nigaraanee hameshaa rahegi
 However, despite the pain of eating food at atms and borrowing vegetables on borrowing money, one should also try to look beyond the pit where the hopes of reconstruction are seen
 yah rahi punarnirmaan kii suchi1
 There is a disaster for the banks, then relief
 faisla lagu hone ke baad bank sanchaalan shuru hone ke pehle do din main akele state bank main hi 55,000 karod ru
 State Bank's total deposits stood at Rs 76,000 crore in the entire quarter
 hota he
 2
 bakaayaa karjon se karahate bainkon ke paas diposit lautenge or puunji kii kami puri karenge
 The government's worries will come down and expectations of lowering interest rates will be tied up
 3
 Property is a stronghold of cash and black money
 vahaan keemten ausatan 30 fisadi tut sakati hai
 Cheap loans and cheap properties can turn the wheel of demand by bringing real customers closer to the houses
 lekin dhyaan rakhie, vittiya maamalon main dhwans tej or nirmaan dhimaa hota he, isliye rajnatik-aarthik keemat chukaani hogi
 Still, if there is any problem, then remove your grief by asking the Modi government: "how long will the full ban on cash political donations be?" Will there be a delay in fixing the limit of cash transactions after big notes? How to stop the hoarding? What is the plan to stop the washing of black money through earning of kheti? Opposition should save its energy for Uttar Pradesh and Punjab elections, because if BJP loads here Money came with force and lavish publicity then assume Lijiaga have any kind of politics on Indian politician price of the common people

 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, while linking Rahul's statement with dictatorship and emergency, has questioned how long pseudo liberals will remain calm
 pradhanmantri ne ek samachar agency ko saal 2019 ke pehle din 95 minute kaa vistrut intervyuu diya tha
 In fact, after the debate on Rafale fighter jet in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, Congress President Rahul Gandhi in his press conference asked reporters in response to a question that he saw a 90-minute interview of the Prime Minister? How was his body language? He said that the 'flexible' journalist interviewing PM Modi himself was also questioning and answering it
 rahul ke is bayaan par intervyuu lene vaali patrkaar smita prakaash ne kadi aapatti darj karai thi
 Now Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley wrote in a tweet attacking Rahul Gandhi, 'the grandson of the Emergency dictator has shown his real DNA by attacking and threatening a freelance editor
 chhadam udaaravaadi kyon shant he? editors gild kii pratikriya kii pratiksha kar rahe he
 'let me tell you that in an interview given to news agency ANI, in response to a question on the Rafale case, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that he was not questioned in this matter
 rahul gandhi ne isi bayaan ko mudda banaate hue kaha ki pradhanmantri kis duniya main rahete hai? rafel deal se jude saare sawaal unheen se puche ja rahe hai
 He had said that PM Modi does not speak on Rafale himself in Parliament and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley makes a hollow argument in his defense

 About six years ago, preparations were made to send a judge of the Karnataka High Court to the Supreme Court, then some senior lawyers took time to meet a member of a five-member collegium in Delhi to prepare a panel of judges
 vakeelon kaa iraadaa us nyaayadhish kii niyukti ko rokna tha
 He wanted the collegium member to give details of the illegal land deals of the judge and his family
 unhone apni baat kehani shuru kii or sadsy ko bataaya ki ve unase milane isliye aae hai, kyonki ve jaanate hai ki nyaaypalika main bhrashtachar kitna gambhir mudda he
 The Supreme Court judge stopped him in the middle, stared at everyone's face and said to them, "is there really corruption in the judiciary?" It was the moment for the lawyers who came to file the petition which indicated to them against which system they were standing against
 bhartiya nyaaypalika ne apane gird satta, visheshadhikaar or protocol kaa jo prabhamandal khadaa kar liya he, vah ab khatre main he
 The 99th Constitutional Amendment and the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act are set to become law after unanimously passing in both houses of Parliament in just three days
 beshak isse nyaaypalika or karypalika main ghamaasan much gaya he ki supreme court or desh bhar ke hycourt main jajon kii niyukti kaa adhikaar kiske paas rahe
 On one side in this confrontation are the judges, who, unlike other countries of the world, choose their own peers
 isse kathith rup se chatukaarita, bhai-bhatijawad or apaardarshita ko badhaava miltaa he
 On the other hand, there is a strong government which wants to tilt the system towards itself by seizing the opportunity to start an era of 'reforms'
 yah karypalika kaa varchasv sthapit karne kii disha main kadam badhaane jaisaa he
 Both pillars of democracy have been publicly demonstrating disagreement on this issue, after stubborn television bytes and provocative speeches that awaken the 'spirit of the Constitution' in Parliament
 naaraaz pradhan nyaayamurti aar
 M
 lodha ne 11 agast ko tippanee kii, “yadi collegium naakaam rahaa to iske product (yani nyaayadhish) bhi naakaam rahe or desh main nyaaypalika bhi naakaam rahi
 Do not destroy the faith of the public in the judiciary
 ” teen din baad kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne vijeta kii mudra main kaha, “sansad apane adhikaron kaa prayog karne se kyon dare? sansad ko kanoon paarit karne ke adhikaar par puraa bharosa hona chahie
 But law-makers, from senior jurist Fali Nariman to former law minister Kapil Sibal, termed the bill as ending the independence of the judiciary and changing the basic structure of the constitution
 1973 main supreme court ne keshavanand bharti cese main faisla sunaaya tha ki samvidhan ke sanshodhan agar uske buniyadi dhaanche kaa ulanghan karte hai to ve nirast maane jaaenge
 Nariman also considers the new bill to be 'unacceptable'
 sibbal yah to maanate hai ki nyaayik niyuktiyon main sudhaar kii jarurat he, par ve kehete hai, “vidheyak ke praavdhaan bataate hai ki sarkaar ke iraade sandigdh hai
 The government wants to control the courts by filling its people
 ”engeesi vidheyak ke mutabik niyukti ayog main chah sadsy honge—supreme court ke teen varishthatam jaj, kanoon mantri or do ‘ganmaan’ vyaktyi jinka chayan ek samiti karegi
 It will also include the Chief Justice of the country, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha
 duusari khaamiyon ke alaava vidheyak kaa vivaadaaspad pahalu yah he ki koi bhi do sadsy kisi ummidavaar ke khilaaf vot de dete hai to use chayan kaa paatr nahin samaj jayega
 In this way, a decision of 5-1 is necessary for acceptance of any appointment
 nyayavidon kaa tark he ki yah vidheyak 1993 ke nyaayamurti je
 s
 verma kii adhyakshata vaali 9 sadasyeey khandpeeth ke faisle ke khilaaf he, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki jajon kii niyukti sirf nyaaypalika kii sahmati se kii jaaegi taaki uski swatantraaa bani rahe
 Sibal and Nariman argue that the two-member veto system is a breach of this privilege, as judicial members can be vetoed
 sibbal or nariman ke alaava ram jethmalani samet duusare logon kaa kahana he ki ve ‘buniyadi dhaanche’ ke aadhaar par ise chunauti denge
 Now the question of lacquer is whether the Supreme Court agrees or not
 yaheen maamla ek dilachasp mode le letaa he
 Several basic problems In the office of Niti Bagh area of delhi, senior advocate and Congress Party spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi is excited about the easy passage of the NJAC Bill
 ve ise desh ke sansadeey itihaas main ek ‘mahatvapurn avasar’ qaraar dete hai
 He does not miss to state that his party is a leader in judicial reforms
 lekin vidheyak main jo praavdhaan galat hai, unhen bataane se bhi nahin chookte
 He explains everything that will change the 'infrastructure' of the Constitution and the Supreme Court can repeal it
 ve do sadasyeey vito ke praavdhaan ke khilaaf tark dete hai
 He says that the matter of appointment of judges should have been part of the constitutional amendment, it should not be left for regulation by the National Judicial Commission
 unhen dar he ki vidheyak ke praavdhaan 5 or 6 ke anusaar sabase varisht jaj ko mukhya nyaayadhish niyukt kiya jayega, basharte ve ‘iske liye upyukt’ ho
 Now what this suitability will be, it has not been defined, because of this there is a possibility of arbitrariness
 singhvi kehete hai, “jaldbaaji main na sirf barabaadi hoti he balki isse gambhir sanvaidhanik khamiyaan bhi paidaa hoti hai
 Better, care must be taken while drafting the bill
 ” vidambnaa to yah he ki bahes kaa samay ab nahin rahaa
 If he had so many objections, why did his party not oppose it when it was presented in both the houses? BJP has shown haste to get the bill passed, including many technical flaws, so the reason for its full support of Congress is not understood, Especially when its legal experts have no shortage of reasons for the bill to be repealed
 shsiddhant rup main” vidheyak ko samarthan dene ko raji hokar congress ne ek jimmedaar vipaksh hone kaa avasar kho diya he, aisa vipaksh jo sandigdh yaa vivaadaaspad vidheyak par bahes karata he
 Our desire to answer these questions leads us to Kapil Sibal
 ve kehete hai, “yah spasht he ki sarkaar apane logon ko nyaaypalika main bharna chaahati he
 The proposal we had prepared in the second term of the UPA did not include a veto of two members
 isse gaiyr-nyaayik sadasyon ko niyukti radd karne kaa adhikaar mil jaataa he
 And this is against the 1993 judgment
 ”vampanthi dalon ne bhi sansad main ek sanshodhan kaa prastaav rakhaa tha jisamen ayog main sadasyon kii sankhya 7 rakhane ko kaha gaya tha
 That member was to be of the Bar Council
 is tarah kanoon birdari ko 4-3 kaa laabh mil jaataa or saadhaaran bahumat se kaam ban jaataa
 Sitaram Yechury, CPM Politburo member, says, "it would have helped to make the system transparent and to continue to dominate the judiciary
 sansad ne is sanshodhan ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 "but Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has the answer," Three of the six members of the Commission are judges, so there is no question of abolishing the supremacy of the judiciary
 ham paardarshee vyavastha chaahate hai
 "before proceeding, let us know how the present system developed, what are the flaws in it and how far the judiciary itself is responsible for the urgent need for reforms
" collegium yaa club?samvidhan ke anuchhed 124 main kaha gaya he ki supreme court or hycourt ke jajon se salaah kar supreme court main nyaayadhish kii niyukti kii jaaegi
 It also states that apart from the appointment of the Chief Justice of the country, his opinion will be taken before all judicial appointments
 anuchhed 217 main hycourt ke nyaayadhishon ke liye bhi aise hi disha-nirdesh die gaye hai, sivaae iske ki isamen rajyon ke rajyapal or hycourt ke mukhya nyaayadhishon kii bhi raay lee jaaegi
 This system was favorable for the newly independent India, when the Chief Justice sent a list of some judges to the President for approval
 takaraav 1960 ke dashak main najar aane lage jab adaalat ne indira gandhi sarkaar ke kai kanoonon ko khaarij kar diya
 These laws were made by the government to fulfill its socialist goals
 inamen privipurs ko khatm karnaa or bainkon kaa rashtriyakaran shaamil tha
 They were revoked on the grounds that they violated fundamental rights
 lekin sarkaar ne sanvaidhanik sanshodhan laakar supreme court ke faisle ko radd kar diya
 When these amendments were challenged, the Supreme Court in 1973 gave that famous judgment that Parliament can amend the constitution but cannot change its 'infrastructure'
 1975 main jab indira gandhi sarkaar ne immergency lagu kii to iskaa pehla shikaar nyaaypalika hi bani
 The judges who were not the favorites of the government, were transferred

 N
 raay ko teen nyaayadhishon kii varishthata langhakar mukhya nyaayadhish bana diya gaya
 In a judgment known as Judges 1 in 1981, the Supreme Court held that the words 'consultation' in Articles 124 and 217 should be taken in the literal sense and all the three organs of government have equal rights in the selection of judges
 yah vyavastha 1993 tak chalati rahi jab jajej-2 faisle ne apekshaakrit kamjor pi
 V
 narsingh raav sarkaar ke dauraan samikarnon ko badal diya
 The 9-judge bench had decided that 'consultation' means 'no' consent or approval of the judiciary in the appointment of judges and no appointment shall be made without the approval of the Chief Justice of the country
 1998 main ise aupchaarik dhaancha diya gaya jab jajej-3 cese main nyaayik collegium kii sanrachana or karypranali spasht kar di gai
 Many administrative reforms were suggested during these years, but this system has existed since then
 iskaa jamini asar yah hua ki collegium khaskar desh ke pradhan nyaayadhish shesh nyaayik vyavastha ke aakaa ban gaye, ek abhijaat-vishisht varg ke varisht nyaayadhish collegium main aise pravesh karte maano kisi oonchi kursi par baith rahe hon
 It became necessary to flatter them, it was a crime to question their choice
 nyayavidon kaa kahana he ki nichali adaalaton or hycourt ke nyaayadhishon ne tikhi tippaniyan deni shuru kin jo surkhiyaan banatin yaa aise faisle dene shuru kiye jo unhen collegium sadasyon ke notice main laa dete
 Legal experts argue that the system that came out of it was neither transparent nor talented candidates would have come forward

 "supreme Court Vs Vikas Apart from these procedural or systemic problems, the issue of supremacy has come to light, because of some recent decisions which led to the perception that the judiciary is crossing the limits
 yah dharna bhi bani ki vartmaan nyaayadhish maamalon par lagaataar monitering karne ke aadi hai or nae bharat kii aarthik vikaas kii bhukh se anjaan hai
 Significantly, in the '60s and' 70s, the judiciary was accused of not being 'sufficiently socialist', while in the 2000s and 2010s there were allegations of not being 'sufficiently development-oriented'
 2 farvari, 2012 ko supreme court ne 2ji ghotaale main lipt hone kii vajah se 122 telecom licenson ko radd kar diya
 The reason given was that the policy of 'first come, first serve' was illegal and unconstitutional
 nyaayadhishon kaa kahana tha ki ve “rajya hai or ghoshnaa kii ki prakritik sansadhano ko sirf nilaamee ke jariye aavantit kiya ja saktaa he
 However, distribution of resources is the prerogative of the executive
 iske sirf aath maheene baad supreme court ne goa main louh ayask ke khanan par pratibandh laga diya, isse pehle 2011 main gaiyr kanoonee gatividhiyon ke chalate karnataka main bhi pratibandh laga tha

 com / 5d9p1dlruh— ANI (@ANI) January 15, 2019 What is the equation of Karnataka Legislative Assembly? Explain that the elections were held in april-may last year in Karnataka, in which the Bharatiya Janata Party emerged as the single largest party
 225 vidhansabha siton vaale karnataka main bijepi ke paas kul 104 vidhayak hai
 Being the largest party, the BJP government was formed in Karnataka on the call of the Governor
 haalanki, vishwaas mat sabit naa hone ke kaaran do dinon main hi sarkaar gir gai thi
 After which the congress-jds formed a government together
 aapako bataa den ki karnataka main sarkaar banane ke liye 113 vidhayakon kii jarurat he
 At present, the Kumaraswamy government has a total of 80 mlas from the Congress and 37 from the JDS
 jabaki 2 nirdaleey vidhayakon ne samarthan waapas le liya he, vahiin basapa kaa ek vidhayak pehle hi samarthan waapas le chukaa he
 Significantly, the BJP currently has 104 mlas, so it needs 9 mlas
 karnataka vidhansabha main kul siten –225bhartiya janata party –104congress –80jedies –37basapa –1anya –1KPJP –1manonith –1congress ko vidhayakon ke jane kaa darasutron kii maane to congress ke kuch vidhayak naaraaz chal rahe hai or mumbai main deraa daale hue hai
 While BJP is also in constant touch with 10 Congress and three JDS mlas
 yahi kaaran he ki congress ne bijepi par vidhayakon kii kharid-farokt karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The BJP may soon bring a no-confidence motion against the Kumaraswamy government in Karnataka

 amar singh ne patrakaron ke sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki unhen lag rahaa he ki amar singh ke bina samaajawaadee party chal sakati he, lekin ajam khan ke bina party kaa chalanaa mushkil he
 Significantly, Azam Khan has been angry with the party leadership for a long time
 ajam kii naaraazgi kaa kaaran amar singh or jayaprada ko mana ja rahaa tha
 The Samajwadi Party's friendship with Kalyan Singh served to add fuel to Azam's displeasure

 The All India Railway Men's Federation, the largest union of railway employees, has opposed the ministry's decision
 federation kaa kahana he jab desh main badi taadaad main yuva log berozegaar hokar gum rahe hai
 In such a situation, how far the scheme of retiring retired employees is justified
 railway board ne is bare main railway kii sabhi divijanon ko patr likhakar kaha he ki diviginal railway manager ritred karmchaariyon ko dobaaraa kaam par rakhane ke liye adhikrut honge
 Railways will give publicity to this matter
 isaki jaankaree tamaam railway kii website par daali jaaegi
 Retired employees under this scheme should not be covered under the Safety Related Retirement Scheme
 ritred karmchaariyon ko dobaaraa naukari par rakhane se pehle unke sefti record ko dekha janaa chahie
 At the same time, other operational needs should also be taken into consideration
 patr main likhaa ki dobaaraa naukari par rakhe gaye ritred railway karmchaariyon kounaki antim ligai tankhwaah se pension ko ghataakar mehtaanaa diya janaa chahie
 Such retiring employees will then be immediately discharged
 jab unki jagah par ararabi se cylected ummidavaar jwine kar lenge
 Significantly, due to shortage of staff in the railway, the scheme of retiring retiring employees was introduced on 16 October 2017
 is skim kii vaidhata 14 sitambar 2018 tak thi
 Now the Railway Board has extended the scheme of retiring retired employees till 1 December 2019

 Work environment to be affected, he said, in the way, the maximum age for retiring retired employees has been increased from 62 years to 65 years

 saath hi railway main kaamkaaj kaa vaataavaran bhi buree tarah se prabhavit ho saktaa he Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi said on RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav becoming RJD President for the 10th time that even though Lalu remembered Jayaprakash Narayan at the party's National Council meeting held in Patna on Tuesday, knowing that standing on the last rung
 Raising a man is a complete revolution, but he did not say how many poor lives have improved in his 15 years of rule
 Sushil Modi asked why millions of poor had to flee to delhi-punjab for livelihood under Lalu's rule and why the factories were being closed tomorrow? Modi said that during rjd's 15 years rule in Bihar The poor were also devastated from their village, but the Lalu family became a billionaire
 susheel modi ne congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi par tanj kasate hue kaha ki jo rahul gandhi endie sarkaar ke pehle bajet satr se thik pehle lambii chuttee manaane videsh chale gaye the or jinaki party sadan main apane netaa kii gaiyrhaaziri kii vajah tak nahin bataa saki thi, unhen ajsansadke sheetakaaleen satr kii badi chintaa he
 Sushil Modi said that the Congress wants to surround Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who gave corruption-free governance, on the issue of alleged corruption, while the country is asking him to account for the scandals of the UPA regime
 unhone kaha kicongress upaadhyakshako apane padonnati se pehle khud ko thodaa apadet karnaa chahie
 Sushil Modi also attacked Congress President Sonia Gandhi and said that she was so pained by the rescheduling of one session of Parliament that she forgot the tradition of her party
 susheel modi ne kaha ki sonia gandhi ko indira gandhi kaa ahankaar yaad nahin aata jiske chalate sansadeey loktantr paraimergencyke jariye 19 maheene lambii chaaya padi thi

 When Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power five years ago, he aroused the sentiments of the people on various issues
 rashtriya suraksha se lekar bhrashtachar tak or mahangaai se lekar berogari tak
 He gave many slogans for this which were taken up by social media
 india today ke data intelegence unit (DIU) ne 2014 or 2019 loksabhaa chunaav prachaar ke dauraan modi ke bhaashanon kaa vishleshan kiya or paaya ki unke content kaa focus kaise badla
 In Modi's speeches, how the emphasis shifted from 'poor' to 'watchman'
 vishleshan ke liye hamane modi ke 2014 or 2019 ke paanch-paanch chunaav purv bhaashanon ko liya
 Such as Patna, Varanasi, Delhi, Chennai and Meerut in 2014
 isi tarah 2019 main bhagalpur, cendrapara, muradabad, panaji or buniyadpur
 What did DIU find in its analysis? Changing focus: If you talk about 2014, the emphasis on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speeches was on the word 'poor'
 ye shabd tab unke bhaashanon main 55 baar aayaa
 But in 2019, the word 'poor' was mentioned 44 times in the Prime Minister's speeches
 lekin frequency ghatane ke baavjood pradhanmantri ke bhaashanon main ‘garib’ doosraa sabase zyada bole janaa vaala shabd rahaa
 In 2014, Modi's speeches include 'congress' (43), 'BJP' (31), 'gujarat' (28), 'kisan' (28) and 'vikas' (25) as the most spoken
 Be involved in words
 agar 2019 main pradhanmantri modi ke bhaashanon kii baat kii jaae to unhone ‘chaukeedaar’ shabd kaa sabase zyaada (106 baar) istemaal kiya
 In March, the Prime Minister launched an 'main Bhi Chowkidar' campaign on Twitter after allegations of corruption by the opposition
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi apni party ke prachaar ke dauraan adhiktar bhaashanon main ‘chaukeedaar chor he’ naare kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 In an exclusive interview with Aaj Tak, PM Narendra Modi said that he had to start a watchman campaign due to the mockery of his background by the opposition
 ‘chaukeedaar’ or ‘garib’ ke alaava 2019 main modi ke bhaashanon main ‘modi’ (42), ‘congress’ (38), ‘vikaas’ (31), ‘kisaan’ (23) or ‘bijepi’ (21) sabase zyada bole jane vaale shabd rahe
 Which word got used? In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Modi used to give special emphasis on Gujarat model of development in his speeches
 isiilie unhone tab ‘vikaas’ shabd kaa 25 baar or ‘gujarat’ kaa 28 baar istemaal kiya
 At the same time, in his speeches of 2019, 'vikas' was mentioned 31 times and 'gujarat' only once
 2014 or 2019 loksabhaa chunaav, donon main hi modi ke bhaashanon main kisaanon ke mudde top par rahe
 In the 2014 election speeches, Modi used the word 'farmer' 28 times and in 2019 23 times
 ‘garibi’ or ‘berogari’ aise mudde hai jinka bijepi ne 2019 ke apane chunaav ghoshnaa patr main vistaar se zikr nahin kiya he
 They were not even mentioned in PM Modi's recent speeches
 2014 main ‘garibi’ shabd kaa modi ne apane bhaashanon main 19 baar zikr kiya jabaki 2019 main iskaa ullekh unhone mahaj 3 baar hi kiya
 Coincidentally, poverty is the central issue of the opposition for this election and it is bouncing it again by repeatedly mentioning its Minimum Income Scheme (justice)
 isi tarah, ‘berogari’ shabd modi ke 2014 ke bhaashanon main 6 baar aayaa tha, lekin 2019 main yah shabd nadaarad rahaa
 Recently there were reports that unemployment is at its all-time high
 lekin piem modi ne ajtak ko die intervyuu main aise daavon ko khaarij kiya tha or kaha tha ki unke paas nae rojgaron ke srijan ke liye ranneeti taiyaar he
 Pakistan and terrorismmodi mentioned 'pakistan' and 'terrorism' both in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha election speeches but the context was different
 2014 main pradhanmantri ne ‘aatankwaad’ kaa zikr apane bhaashanon main sirf ek baar kiya
 PM Modi said that he is surprised about many terrorist incidents
 2019 par aaen to ‘aatank’, ‘aatanki’ or ‘aatankwaad’ shabdon kaa mila kar piem ke bhaashanon main 24 baar ullekh aayaa
 In the 2014 election speeches, Modi had said four times that Pakistan is causing trouble for India
 2019 main pradhanmantri ke bhaashanon main ‘pakistan’ shabd 15 baar aayaa
 The words 'pakistan' and 'terrorism' came together in Modi's 2019 speeches, but in 2014 it was not so
 BJP kii tulana main modi kaa zikr zyaadadilachasp he ki piem modi ke bhaashanon main paanch saal main ‘modi’ shabd kaa istemaal jahaan bad gaya vahiin ‘bijepi’ kaa zikr ghat gaya
 In 2014, Modi used the word 'BJP' 33 times and 'modi' 11 times
 haalanki 2019 main piem ne ‘modi’ kaa zikr 42 baar or ‘bijepi’ kaa 24 baar kiya
 PM Modi used the word 'congress' more often than 'BJP' both in 2014 and 2019, but the frequency decreased in five years
 2014 main modi ke bhaashanon main ‘congress’ kaa ullekh 45 baar aayaa vahiin 2019 main ye ghatakar 38 baar rah gaya
 In 2014, 'congress' was the second top word spoken in Modi's speeches which rose to number four in 2019
 pehle teen sthanon par ‘chaukeedaar’, ‘garib’ or ‘modi’ shabd rahe

 loksabhaa chunaav main kareeb 10 fisadi or vidhansabha chunaav main kareeb 17 fisadi muslimon ne bijepi ko vot diya tha
 42 to BJP in Lok Sabha elections
 63 fisadi, sapa ko 22
 35 per cent and BSP 19
 77 fisadi vot mili the
 If SP and BSP vote percentage is added then Aakra 42
 12 fisadi tak pahunch jaataa he
 At the same time, BJP got 40 percent (312 seats), SP got 22 percent (47 seats) and BSP got 22 percent (17 seats) votes in the assembly elections
 yani sapa or basapa ko 44 fisadi vot mili the
 In the Lok Sabha by-elections, the SP and BSP came together in the by-elections held after both these elections
 nateeja hua ki bijepi ko apane garh main karaari haar jhelni padi

 muslim voton ke bantwaare kii tulana kamayah bhi sachai he ki upi main musalamaanon kii badi aabaadi hone ke baavjood 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ek bhi muslim sansad nahin pahunch sakaa
 Political experts believe that in 2014, due to the sharing of Muslim votes between the SP-BSP and the Congress, there was a political loss, but now this time the SP-BSP, the two powerful parties of UP, is in a camp - in such a way, the Muslim vote than before It is possible that it will be distributed even less
 muslim voton ko prabhavit karne vaale mudde- teen talaak- ram mandir- go raksha ke naam par hinsa- urdu shikshakon kii chantnibijepi phir kar paaegi sendhamari?haalanki, pradhanmantri narendra modi ne teen talaak par kanoon banaakar muslim mahilaon ko takat dene kii koshish kii he
 Politically, it was considered a bet to favor the Muslim women of the BJP
 ab aise main sawaal uthta he ki kya loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav kii tarah bijepi aagaamee aam chunaav main bhi muslim voton main sendhamari kar paaegi yaa phir muslim vot ekatarfa sapa-basapa ke khate main jaaenge

 Significantly, the Indian Mujahideen commander, Dr
 Shahnawaz, conspired in the serial blast in Varanasi
 varanasi ke ghat par jo dhamaakaa hua, wo sajeesh paanch saal pehle se rachi ja rahi thi
 According to information quoted by sources, the commander of the Indian Mujahideen, Dr
 Shahnawaz, hatched a conspiracy for the serial blast in Varanasi
 yah vahi aadmi he jisane 2005 main varanasi ke dashashwamedh ghat par visphotak lagaaya tha
 The man born in Azamgarh worked as a doctor in Mayo Hospital, Lucknow
 marijon kaa ilaaj karanevaala yah shahanvaaj khud maansik taur par biimaar tha
 Intelligence suggests that Shahnawaz Alam performs all his nefarious plans while sitting in Dubai
 sutron ne jo hamen bataaya he uske mutabik shahanvaaj alam sabase pehle aatif amin se judaa tha
 The Indian Mujahideen tasked it with mobilizing people
 saal 2003 main shahanvaaj ne baqayada hathiyaar or visphotak ke liye aatanki training lee
 The same Shahnawaz planted an IED in 2005 at Dashashwamedh Ghat in Varanasi
 mumbai ke local train or phir dilli ke dhamaakon ke liye alag-alag jagahon par shahanvaaj ne hi visphotak lagaae the
 It is also said that in December 2009, Shahnawaz went to Karachi and took training from ISI
 ajtak ko haath lagi jaankaree ke mutabik, indian mujahiddeen ke ek modul ko varanasi ke un ilaakon main hamale kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya tha, jin ilaakon main marathi log bahutayat main rahete hai
 Due to this intelligence, security was also increased in many areas of Varanasi
 lekin jab kai maheenon tak koi vaardaat nahin hui to suraksha sust pad gai
 It is now feared that the same module has caused this explosion
 2010 kii shuruyaat main upi police ne salmaan urf chotu naam ke ek aatankwaadi ko giraftaar kiya tha
 This person had told that Shahnawaz Alam is the new commander of terror in India
 varanasi ke ghaaton ko dahalane ke liye shahanvaaj pehle se sajeesh rachataa rahaa he
 It was also tried in 2005
 isbaar uski sajeesh kaam kar gai

 ghatana ke samay kejariwal nai dilli loksabhaa kshetra se aap ke ummidavaar brijesh goyal ke prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan moti nagar ilaake main yojit road sho main hissaa le rahe the
 Just then, a young man wearing a red t-shirt mounted Kejriwal's jeep and slapped him
 dilli police ke epiaro anil mittal ne bataaya ki disipi str kii jaanch ke aadesh de diye gaye hai
 Police said the attacker, according to Suresh, was upset with the behavior of the party leaders and was angry that the party had expressed 'distrust of the armed forces'
 aap ke rajyasabha sadsy sanjay singh ne shanivaar ko kejariwal par huye hamale ke baad kaha ki yah ghatana mukhyamantri kii suraksha main badi chook he
 He tweeted, 'the security of the Chief Minister of Delhi is under the Modi government but Kejriwal's life is most vulnerable
 baar-baar hamalaa or phir police kaa ronaa, kya saazish he iske peeche? himmat he to saamne aakar waar karo dusron ko hathiyaar banaakar nahin
 Anticipating the conspiracy behind the attack on Kejriwal, Singh said, "kejriwal's security has been repeatedly missed
 kya modi sarkaar kejariwal par kisi bade hamale kaa intazaar kar rahi he? yaa phir koi badi saazish he?'upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne twit kar kaha, ‘kya modi or amit shah ab kejariwal kii hatya karwaanaa chaahate hai? paanch saal sari taaqat lagaakar jiskaa manobal nahin tod sake, chunaav main nahin haraa sake, ab use raste se is tarah hataanaa chaahate ho, cairo! ye kejariwal hi tumhaara kaal he
 Meanwhile, BJP state president Manoj Tiwari condemned the incident and said that violence has no place in politics
 manoj tiwari ne yah vaardaat ke aap pryojit hone kii ashanka jataate huye kaha ki chunaav ke samay hi kejariwal par hamale kyon hote hai
 Significantly, last year also a young man tried to throw chilli powder on Kejriwal
 isse pehle bhi un par dilli vidhansabha chunaav main prachaar ke dauraan ek vyakti ne jeep par chadh kar chaanta maaraa tha
 Once he has also fallen victim to ink attack
 aam aadmi party ke pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj ne kejariwal par hamale ke peeche bhaajapa kaa haath hone kii ashanka jataate huye kaha ki chunaav main haar ke dar se baukhlaaye vipakshi dal is tarah ke hatkande apana rahi he
 He alleged that the Delhi Police has got this man transported
 unhone kaha, ‘dilli police ne aap se sambandhit ek vyakti ko shaamil karavaaya he
 This is a shame because the fact that the attacker's wife herself has said that her husband is a Modi devotee and does not like to hear anything against Modi
 'unhone is hamale ko kaayarta purna harakat bataate huye kaha ki vipaksh dwaara pryojit in hamalon se aap ko dilli main rokna mumkin nahin hoga
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee condemned the attack on her Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal and said that the attack on opposition leaders indicated that the BJP was losing the Lok Sabha elections and was frustrated

 bin mausam hui barsaat or kam utpaadan ke kaaran pyaaj ke daam aasmaan par pahunch gaye he
 Nearly 30-35% of the 20 million tonnes of onion production was ruined in the last financial year due to unseasonal rains between February and April
 market exparts kaa maananaa he ki pyaaj kaa bhav oktober tak badha rahegaa
 Why are the prices not falling? Onion wholesaler Rajiv Maniyar in Navi Mumbai said that the wastage was further aggravated due to excess moisture, worsening soil conditions and other reasons
 supplai bahut kamjor he
 In this case, the price of interest rose by 50-60 per cent in the wholesale and retail markets
 vahiin kendriya krishi mantralay ne pakistan, china, misr tathaa anya deshon se kareeb 10 hajaar ton pyaaj kaa aayaat bhi kiya par keemat kam nahin hui
 Productivity is low? Although India is the second largest producer of onions in the world after China, the yield of onion in the country is only 14 tonnes per acre
 vahiin china main ek acre main 22 ton pyaaj to myanmar main 23 ton or turki main 30 ton ausat utpaadan he
 Where expensive onion? Price in Mumbai's wholesale market has increased from Rs 22 per kg to Rs 32
 vahiin khudara bazaar main pyaaj 42-45 rupee ke aas-paas bik rahaa he
 In Uttar Pradesh, the country's largest population, onions are priced at Rs 40 per kg, up from Rs 20 a year ago
 kinartak main bhi pyaaj ek maheene main 25-30 rupee prati kilogram se badhkar 50-55 rupee main bikne laga he
 So how will the price be reduced? According to traders, the price may be reduced with the arrival of new onion in the market
 abhi nae pyaaj ke bazaar main aane main samay he
 To prevent price increases, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade has raised the minimum export price to $ 425 from $ 250 per tonne in June to export interest
 philhal oktober se pehle pyaaj ke daam kam hone ke koi asaar nahin dikh rahe
 Why prices rise every year? There has been such a fix pattern that onion prices rise every year during this period
 pyaaj ko lekar bazaar main hai tauba machane lagati he
 Regarding this fix pattern, Bangalore's potato and onion wholesaler Srinivas Gowda said that failure to create reserves to increase onion supply and delay in taking control of exports increases the price of onions every year

 He also said that the Tata group has been at a disadvantage over time due to lack of opacity, joking with compliance and abuse of capacity test in the policy of awarding large contracts
 ek nijee tivi samachar channel ke saath ek saakshaatkaar main tata ne kaha ki niveshkon kii drushti se sarkaar kii nitiyon main lagaataar anischitata dikh rahi he
 "yes, i think so, this is what i always think and i have said it openly in many times
 aisi nitiyon ke peeche sarkaar nahin he, inke peeche kuch swaarth kaam kar rahe hai
 Regarding the use of exports and natural resources, he said that we have been going against the policies of the national criterion of self-reliance of Mr
 Nehru and Mrs
 Gandhi for many years, whereas in many areas of manufacturing we are competing against any country in the world
 can do
 tata ne kaha ki vah kai baar niti nirmaataaon se kah chuke hai ki rashtriya sansaadhan ek mahatvapurn masalaa hai
 Tata said, "but in such subjects where both the Center and the states have the right, nothing special happens
 unhone in khabaron kaa khandan kiya ki unke samooh ne jharkhand ke purv mukhyamantri madhu kodaa ko khanan riyaayaten hasil karne ke liye paisa diya tha
 Tata said that this is completely wrong

 We did not get any lease at the time of the whip
 tata samooh ke mukhiya ne mana ki in aaropon kii charchaa unhone bhi suni he
 He said that enforcement agencies had also called Tata Steel in this regard
 hamane unhen bhi yahi jawaab diya he
 Asked if he now feels sad about entering the telecom sector, Tata said
 haa 
 He said, yes, due to lack of stability in policies
 
 Or because of the discrimination that is done
 
 Sometimes i feel sad but this is a very good area
 ’ek anya sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki doorsanchaar kshetra ek aisa udhaaharan he jahaan sarkaar kii nitiyaan us tareeke yaa bhaavana se lagu nahin hui hai, jaise honi chahie thi
 He said, 'many times the policies were amended to benefit some people
 ’ unhone kaha ki aamtaur par niti badalane ke beeche kuch hit hote hai
 However, he made it clear that till date no one has asked for money from his group in the telecom sector
 unhone kaha ki doorsanchaar kshetra main nitiyon ko kai baar badla gaya taaki kisi khaas vyakti ko laabh ho sake
 Initially this may have happened due to the lack of public sector companies
 phir yah ek varg yaa duusare varg ke phaayde ke liye hota rahaa
 He said, 'generally there is some inherent health behind every change, every deviation
 ’ unhone kaha ki pehle nitiyon unka paalan hota tha par aaj kisi niti kii vyakhya bahut hi dhundhlee ho gayi he
 He said, "in such a situation, if you want to say something, then the other person will start giving a different interpretation of it, she will be such a stupid and confused that you will wake up from that meeting thinking that i will not be able to do it
" ’tata ne isi sandarbh main nagar vimaanan kshetra main apane dobaaraa pravesh ke prayaas kaa zikr kiya or kaha ki kis tarah narsingh raav sarkaar se lekar devgauda or gujral sarkaar ke daur main nitiyon main badlaav hote rahe

 He claimed that the book contains three maps where the exact place of birthplace is inscribed
