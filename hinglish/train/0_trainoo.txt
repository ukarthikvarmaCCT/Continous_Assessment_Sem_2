 International Women's Day is celebrated every year on 8 March all over the world, but ironically, there are a large number of women in our country who do not know anything about this day
 isi ko dhyaan rakhte hue mashhoor tivi abhinetri shubhangi atre ne jaagrukta failaane kaa ek kadam uthaaya he
 Atre has become famous for playing the role of Angoori Bhabhi in a private TV channel's famous serial 'bhabhiji Ghar Par Hai'
 atre ne apni pahal ke tahat antarrashtriya mahila diwas ko un mahilaon ke saath manaaya jinhen iske mahatv ke bare main kuch bhi nahin pataa tha
 Not only did he convey the importance of this day to common women, but he also presented them gifts
 atre ne sarkaar se apil kii he ki in mahilaon kii madad kare
 Atre said, "there are many women in our villages who are at the bottom of society
 do vakt kii roti ke liye unka jivan dushwariyon se bharaa rahata he
 They do not even know why Women's Day is celebrated and what is its significance
 mujhe laga ki in mahilaon ke bich aakar mahila adhikaron ke prati jaagrukta failaai jaae
 "she further added that it is sad to see that even on the day of International Women's Day, women appear to be picking up garbage in many villages and cities
 sarkaar ko in mahilaon ki madad kerani chahie taaki ye bhi sammaan se jeevanyaapan kar saken
 Obviously, by helping celebrities to come forward for such women's rights and spread awareness, the message will spread faster to the people
 kendriya rail mantri pawan kumaar bansal ne ajtak channel ke sidhi baat kaarykram main hedlins today ke managing editor rahul kanwal se baatcheet kii
 Here are the key parts of the conversation: Public wants to know why the rail fare was increased? After all, why the burden is being increased on the public? Whenever the price of something increases in the market, the consumer is hurt
 railway kaa network bada he, jis par 2
 300 million people travel daily
 das saal main kiraye nahin bade
 And if fares do not increase, then we will not be able to increase the new railway stock, renewal of railways, safety, and all the things we talk about
 das saal main bas kaa kiraaya, or baaki chizon kii keemten doguni ho gai hai
 The public is troubled by that
 ise extra boj nahin mana janaa chahie
 If you give more subsidy in something, then the financial deficit increases
 par kiraaya bajet main kyon nahin badhaayaa?parliament ne sarkaar ko adhikaar diya hua he ki aap jab chahen, kiraaya badha sakate hai
 The budget is coming next month
 aap intjaar kar sakate the
 i am doing my duty towards the people
 kiraaya 2 paise se 10 paise bad gaya he lekin ham logon ko ve sevaayen de sakenge jo hamaari jimmedaari he
 i am sure people will understand this because we have an estimated Rs 1,200 crore in two and a half months
 aaenge
 But somewhere the government was concerned that if the fare increase in the budget session, there would be a ruckus
 sansad to har vakt phase kerani he
 Without him democracy would not work
 par sheetakaaleen satr ke kuch din pehle hi mujhe vibhaag mila tha, nayaa tha isiilie kiraaya nahin badha saktaa tha
 The public feels that you have been brought in to increase the fare
 meraa kaarykaal puraa hone par log realyse karenge ki pawan bansal ne kiraye badaye to unhone acchhee sevaayen bhi pradaan kii hai
 Where are the services? Look at the condition of the stations, coaches, dirt and smell all around
 khaane kaa vahi haal
 Are right
 kai steshnon par jaakar dekha he, toilat bhi dekhe hai
 One thing Sonia Gandhi said to me was to get bio-toilets installed
 is saal 2,500 toilet kaa praavdhaan kar rahe hai, jisko dhire-dhire badhayenge
 Can all change in a single day? He has increased the rent, his money will come, he will be able to do something with that
 china main trainen 200-250 kimi kii raftaar se daudti hai
 Needles do not move beyond 60–70 here
 china ko hamen udhaaharan ke taur par lenaa chahie
 He has progressed
 par vahaan raat main faisla kiya, subah lagu
 Can this happen here? Do not, who is stopping you? This is the difference between democracy and their system
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki yah to pehali kist he
 The budget will be further burdened
 main vaada karata hum ki bajet main kiraaya nahin badhegaa
 i have planned this for a year
 laagat lagaataar bad rahi he, dijal ke daam hi itane oonche ho gaye
 If (increased) 6,000 crores Rs
 dijal main hi nikal gaye to phir main logon ke saamne yah baat rakhuunga
 But today it is not a possibility
 main samajhataa hum, 6,600 karod ru
 See you next year and we will be able to provide better services

 Akshay Kumar has given clarification on his behalf to calm the ongoing controversy over his citizenship
 lekin uske baavjood soshal media par ise lekar jamkar riection aa rahe hai
 Bollywood actor-producer Kamal r Khan has been tweeting about the citizenship of Akshay Kumar for a long time and now after Akshay Kumar's statement came
 kamaal aar khan ne twit ke jariye deshbhakti or deshadrohi kii baat uthaai he
 Anyway, this statement of citizenship of Akshay Kumar is becoming increasingly viral on social media and people are interpreting it in their own way
 Sir it doesn't matter if you didn't visit ur country Canada for last 7 years
 Even it doesn't matter how do you feel about our country India
 Ur citizenship is not ur personal matter when you teach us Indians Deshbhakti and interfere about politics
 https: / / t
 co / es9hw7dgsikamala aar khan (kamaal r Khan) ne twit kiya haih 'agar koi bhi bhartiya canada kii naagarikta paane ke liye apni bharat kii naagarikta ko chodta he
 This means that he hates India and loves Canada
 yani vah deshadrohi he
 And we Indians do not need to learn the lesson of patriotism from the traitors
 ' is tarah kamaal aar khan ne riplai kiya he
 Although Kamal r Khan has made a film called 'deshrohi'
 If any Indian drops his Indian nationality to get Canada nationality, means he hates India and loves Canada
 Means he is a # Deshdrohi
 And we Indians don't need to learn # Deshbhakti from such # Deshdrohi people
 Akshay Kumar has told ANI news agency, 'I do not understand my interest and negativity about my citizenship and needless
 maine kabhi is baat se na to inkaar kiya or na hi chipaaya ki mere canadian passport he
 But it is also true that i have not been to Canada for the last seven years
 main bharat main kaam karata hum, or apane saare tex yaheen detaa hum
 In this way, Akshay Kumar has tried to pacify the disputes that have arisen over his citizenship
 in varshon main, mujhe kisi ko bharat ke prati apane pyaar ko siddh karne kii jarurat nahin padi
 i am sad that my citizenship is being unnecessarily disputed
 yah puri tarah se nijee maamla he
 Is a legal matter
 gaiyr-rajnatik he or isse kisi ke upar koi fark nahin padane vaala he
 'akshay Kumar has thus tried to silence those who criticize against him
 kuch din pehle akshay kumaar ne piem narendra modi kaa ek gaiyr-rajnatik intervyuu bhi kiya tha
 'he has every right to live & work here
 We admire and respect him as a Canadian of Indian origin
 But given that he can't vote in India, he is an odd choice to host an interview intended to make Indians vote for the BJP

 According to the statement, 'jnu's structure reflects the character of our society, as women and students from disadvantaged sections and backward districts are properly represented here
 yah bhartiya samaaj ko lekar aresas kii kalpana, jo ‘hindu raashtra’ he, ke khilaaf jaataa he
 'the article printed in the RSS mouthpiece' RSS 'mouthpiece' Panchjanya 'alleges that JNU is the base of a large anti-national group aimed at disintegrating India
 ’ mukhpatr ke cover lekh main daawa kiya gaya he ki jeenyu ke naksal samarthak chaatr sanghon ne varsh 2010 main chhattisgarh ke dantewada main hue naksali hamale main siarpief ke 75 javaanon kii maut kaa khuleam jashn manaaya tha 
 'it all happened under the nose of the JNU administration
 ’ isamen aarope lagaaya gaya he ki jeenyu niyamit rup se rashtravirohi gatividhiyon kaa aayojan karata he
 The article noted that when the Soviet Union disintegrated, a new political idea emerged in institutions such as JNU that began to shift from the political slogan 'class strugal' to 'cast strugal'
 chaatrasangh ne kiya yah bhi daawachatrasangh ne yah daawa bhi kiya ki jeenyu par aise samay main hamalaa bolaa gaya he jab uniwarsity kii academik parishad ne vaidic samskruti ke paathyakramon kii shuruuaat ke prastaav ko khaarij kar diya 
 According to the JNUSU statement, 'it is shocking that the RSS has not opened its mouth on a key student movement' Occupy UGC ', but is abusing the students and calling them anti-national just because of this Because they are fighting for their right to education
 ’- input bhashaa Eventually the deadlock between the AAP government and LG House ended and the stalled file of the Mohalla clinic was cleared
 aise main buudhvaar ko aap vidhayakon kaa protest aakhirkaar rang laayaa
 In this whole matter, your hand was heavy
 guuruuvaar ko dilli ke mukhyamantriaravind kejariwalelji anil baijal ke saath meeting ke liye pahunche, to tamaam ashankaayen saamne thim
 a day earlier, 45 mlas of the Aam Aadmi Party had sat on a dharna inside the LG house and were not ready to rise until the file of the Mohalla clinic was cleared
 guuruuvaar ko siem kejariwal, dipti siem manish sisodiya or swasthya mantri satyendra jain alji anil baijal ke saath meeting ke liye pahunche
 All the officials associated with the Health Department and Mohalla Clinic Project were already present for the meeting
 kareeb sava paanch baje siem or alji kii baithak shuru hui or saade paanch bajte bajte khabar aa gai ki mohalla clinics ko lekar sarkaar or alji house ke bich dedlock khatm ho gaya he
 In the meeting that lasted barely twenty minutes, the Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal himself brought out the information about clearing the file of Mohalla Clinic
 alji house ke baahar media se baat karte hue unhone kaha ki meeting acchhee rahi or mohalla clinics se jude tamaam masale isi mangalvaar tak sulajhaa liye jaaenge
 Although CM Kejriwal did not seem to be in a mood to talk much about this meeting, the glow on his face was telling that he was realizing his victory
 isiilie unhone elaan kii shakl main apane vidhayakon ko bhi kaha ki mangalvaar tak unke ilaake main mohalla clinics nirmaan main aa rahi dikkaton kaa nipataara ho jayega
 It is worth mentioning that on Wednesday afternoon, 45 mlas of Aam Aadmi Party reached Raj Niwas to meet LG
 haalanki alji house ke mutabik alji ne sirf chaar vidhayakon ko milane kaa vakt diya tha
 But after this, the matter increased so much that 45 mlas were not ready to leave the LG house
 aakhirkaar 7 ghante kaa drama guuruuvaar ko siem or alji kii meeting tay hone ke baad khatm hua tha or guuruuvaar ko mahaz bees minute main maamla sulajhaa liya gaya
 The mlas who had camped inside the LG House, were not allowed to go around the LG House, on Thursday, the police also did not let them go around the LG House
 buudhvaar kii ghatana ke baad sabak lete hue police ne alji house kii jabardast gheraabandi kar di, nateeja ye hua ki siem alji kii baithak ke vakt jo vidhayak alji house pahunche, wo sadak par barish main bheegate najar aaen
 CM Kejriwal had a meeting with LG Lt
 Governor Anil Baijal at 5 pm on Thursday evening
 is meeting main vidhayakon kaa koi kaam nahin tha or na hi unhen meeting ke liye koi bulaava bheja gaya tha, lekin kai vidhayak alji house pahunche
 The police barricaded them on the roadside and did not let them even break around the LG house
 kiya intjarbarish main bheegate vidhayak sanjeev jha ne bataaya ki wo yahaan bina bulaae aae hai, kyonki ye ladaai wo apane ilaake main mohalla clinics khulwaane ke liye lard rahe hai
 He expressed surprise at the arrangements made by the police and said that the police were treating them as if they were criminals and not elected representatives
 chandani chowk se vidhayak alka lamba ne kaha ki unhen sadak kinare khadaa rahanaa manjuur he, unhen koi khatirdaari nahin chahie, lekin makasad mohalla clinics se jud filon ko clear karana he
 Apart from Jha and Lamba, about ten to twelve mlas were seen waiting outside the police barricade to end the meeting
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main jedy(you) ke kharaab pradarshan ke baad 17 may ko nitish kumaar ke istipha de dene ke baad unki jagah lene ke liye jab jithan ram maanjhi ko 19 may ko mukhyamantri ke sarkari nivas 1 ane maarg bulaayaa gaya to ve ekadam vinamr or dabbu netaa kii pratimurti bane hue the
 Yet he had dared to ask a question to his patron, "will it be like Dasharatha Baba?" His intention was to ask him how long he was being given the post of Chief Minister
 unki ichha pahaad kaatane vaale dasharath maanjhi banane kii katai nahin thi, jinhen 2007 main nitish ne sammanswaroop mukhyamantri kii kursi par paanch minute ke liye baitha diya tha
 Many political analysts still wonder how tall and experienced leaders like Nitish consider Manjhi to be obedient, but forgetting to assume that he was willing to ensure his tenure rather than just standing and sitting
 nitish ko iskaa ehsaas nau maah baad 7 farvari, 2015 ko hua jab maanjhi vichaar-vimarsh ke liye unke nae awaas 7 circular road par to pahunche lekin unhone nitish ke liye mukhyamantri kii kursi khaali karne se inkaar kar diya
 Nitish asked him to attend the meeting of the legislature party which was convened without Manjhi's approval
 jaahir tha, baatcheet naakaam rahi
 Manjhi, who has always preferred to remain in the shadow of his leaders after leaving a few months in his 35-year political career, suddenly saw a greater chance of becoming a rebel as a daredevil while most people would accept half-retirement from this 70-year-old Mahadalit leader
 Was hopeful
 maanjhi main is badlaav kaa shrey bhi nitish ko hi jaataa he jinhone is mahadalit netaa ko apni dabi-padi aakankshaayen khoj nikaalane kaa mauka diya
 When Nitish chose Manjhi as his successor, it was considered a trump trick and also logical
 aakhir nitish ne hi mahadaliton ko ek alag varg ke rup main jagah di thi
 But emotions and aspirations replaced logic and statistics
 maanjhi ko is baat kaa ehsaas hone main der na lagi ki rajya main aabaadi kaa kareeb 20 fisadi hissaa hone kii vajah se mahadalit kisi duusare sabase bade jati samooh yani yadavon se bhi kahin zyada hai, lihaaja rajya kaa mukhyamantri hona to hameshaa se unka haq tha
 Manjhi has emerged as the biggest leader of Dalits in the state due to his pro-dalit decisions during his nine-month tenure as Chief Minister and his proclamation on issues of Dalits
 unhone apane sapanom ko amali jama pehanaanaa shuru kar diya he or khud ko hataae jane ke parinamswaroop daliton main panpate gusse main unhen apane liye mauka najar aa rahaa he
 He has made up his mind to contest at least 125 of the total 243 seats in the state assembly elections to be held in october-november this year
 unhone apane iraade yah kahkar jaahir bhi kar die hai ki unke hindustani avam morche (ham) ko ek purna siyaasi party ke rup main badal diya jayega
 Manjhi said, "if i felt that there was increasing support for us, we could fight alone
 " vaise unhone is baat par saaf jor diya ki ve bijepi ke saath ''chunaav-baad samjhaute" ke liye raji hai
 Of course, he will pose a tough challenge for both BJP and anti-nitish, ready to join hands with him
 bijepi ko unki aakankshaon par lagaam lagaae rakhane ke liye unhen raji karnaa hoga to nitish ko apana mahadalit vot bank surakshit rakhane ke liye jujhna hoga
 Nitish's government had formed the State Mahadalit Commission in August 2007 to identify those castes which were left behind in the development process
 mahadalit ayog kii siforeeshon par hi nitish sarkaar ne april 2008 main anusuchit jatiyon main se 18 jatiyon ko ''mahadalit" ke rup main chihnit kiya tha
 The government then took several steps for their educational and social upliftment
 jin chaar jatiyon ko mahadalit varg se baahar chhod diya gaya ve hai-dhobi, ravidaas, paasi or dushaadh (paswan)
 However, the Nitish government included the Pasi and Dhobi castes on 28 July 2009 and the Ravidas caste on 17 November 2009 as Mahadalit
 sirf ek jati dushaadh ko mahadalit shrenee se baahar rakhaa gaya tha jo ki anusuchit jatiyon main thode zyada shikshit or prabhaav vaale hai
 Thus, by the end of 2009, a year before the 2010 assembly elections, Nitish had included the remaining 21 of the 22 Scheduled Castes, except Dusadh, in the Mahadalits category
 isse yah bhi aarope lage ki nitish ne keval dushaadh ko mahadalit shrenee se isliye baahar rakhaa kyonki ve unki bajaae unke siyaasi pratidwandvi ramvilas paswan ke prati nishthavan the
 But Nitish's administrative decisions gave him many political benefits
 unke netritv main endie ne rajya main 2009 ke loksabhaa or 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main badi jeet hasil kii
 Being a Mahadalit chief minister, Manjhi also had the opportunity to unite the Dalits
 unhone dusaadhon tak pahunch banaakar thik yahi kiya
 Ahead of the trust vote which he resigned from the post without facing it, Manjhi also included the Dusadhas in the category of Mahadalits
 isse dusaadhon bhi rajya main mahadaliton ke vikaas ke liye bani skiimon ke tahat phaaydon ke hakdaar ho gaye
 This step was in keeping with Manjhi's political thinking that instead of dividing the Scheduled Castes into 22 different castes, they should be tied into one circle
 ve aksar anusuchit jatiyon se yah apil karte rahe hai ki ve sab ''ek parivaar" hai or agar ve aise hi bane rahe to ''satta unke haathon main hogi
 "now Manjhi has first expressed his intention to form Hindustan Awam Morcha on February 28, within eight days of resigning as Chief Minister
 jaahir he ki ve rajya main rajnatik takat ke rup main ubharne ke liye sochi-samajhi yojana par chal rahe hai
 Manjhi and his supporters, including some JD (U) rebel mlas, called a rally on 20 April
 raily se pehle logon kaa samarthan jutaney kii koshish main maanjhi pradesh bhar main kai kaarykram yojit karenge
 Clearly, Bihar is getting ready for a very interesting election this year
 maanjhi kii taiyaari or unki sambhavit bhoomika ne rajya kii siyaasi patakatha main nayaa mode laa diya he
 The number of Dalits in the state has always been high, but they never claimed any leadership role
 kya ab isamen badlaav hoga? kya ab bihar bhi uttar pradesh ke raste par chalegaa?bijepi kii ranneeti maanjhi kii peeth par sawari karke mahadaliton kaa samarthan hasil karne kii he
 This will significantly increase the base of the saffron camp and help it to face the common opposition of Lalu, Nitish and Congress
 lekin agar use maanjhi kaa saath nahin mil paata he to uske paas agadi jatiyon ke kuch voton ke alaava atyadhik pichhadi jatiyaan (ibisi) or anya pichhadi jatiyon (obisi) ke hi kuch vot rah jaaenge
 He definitely has some Dalit votes through Ram Vilas Paswan's LJP
 duusari ore nitish, lalu or congress kii mili-juli takat ko yadav, kurmi or muslim voton kaa acha-khaasaa hissaa mil jayega or ibisi tathaa obisi kaa bhi tagada hissaa
 This fight can be so close that no one is getting a sigh of relief
 agar maanjhi apane or bijepi ke liye dalit voton main send lagane main kaamyaab na hue to kaagajon par nitish-lalu gathbandhan behatar sthiti main dikhaai detaa he
 The second aspect is that Manjhi can get out on hard bargaining and it would be baffling for the BJP to ignore his political skills
 isliye bijepi behad satark he
 She has supported the minority government of Dalit leader Mayawati thrice in neighboring Uttar Pradesh, but each time it has resulted in Mayawati's strength and weakness
 lihaaja bijepi ke man main maanjhi ko lekar ummid bhi he or dar bhi
 They have created both a chance and a crisis for him
 mauka isliye ki unhen saath lekar bijepi nitish or lalu kii mili-juli takat kaa muqabla kar sakati he or sankat isliye ki maanjhi mayawati kii tarah nahin hai
 He cannot be forced to be a hanger of the BJP
 aakhirkaar, maanjhi ne pehle hi baagiyon vaale tevar dikhaa die hai
 This is the beginning of the Manjhi era in Bihar
 koi bhi party-chaahe vah unke saath khadi ho yaa unke khilaaf, un par paini nigahen rakhe bina apni chunavi ranneeti banane kii sthiti main nahin he
  bihar ke jahanabad jile membjrang dal ke kaaryakartaone ravivaar ko ek isai bhawan par hamalaa kar diya or usamen todphod kii
 The incident in Jehanabad, 52 km from Patna, has spread fear among the minority Christian community
 samudaay ne police suraksha kii maang kii he
 a district police official said that some Bajrang Dal activists attacked and vandalized the Christian building in Jehanabad city
 bajrangiyon ne isai samudaay par garib hinduon kaa dharm-parivartan karaane kaa aarope lagaate hue pradarshan kiya
 The Bajrangians also blocked National Highway No
 83 connecting Gaya to the capital Patna
 baad main haalanki dharm-parivartan kii baat bebuniyaad sabit hui
 According to the police, the activists alleged that a pastor was converting poor Hindu families in Christian Bhavan
 magar police ne jaanch main paaya ki isai samudaay ke log prarthana main jute the
 There was no program like conversion
 bihar main pichley dedh maheene main kareeb 200 garib hinduon ne isai dharm apanaaya he
 Most of them are from Mahadalit community
 mahadaliton kaa kahana he ki samaaj main lagaataar upekshit kiye jane ke kaaran unhone hindu dharm chhodana uchit samajha
 The Hinduist organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and its constituent Bajrang Dal have alleged that poor Hindu families are being lured into the state for conversion
 gauratlab he ki bihar main isi varsh vidhansabha chunaav hona he
 Like the neighboring state of Jharkhand, the Bharatiya Janata Party is already trying to snatch away the power of Bihar from Janata dal-united
 hinduvadi sanghathanon ke is karname ko dharmik bhaavana bhadakaakar bijepi ke liye vot bank taiyaar kiye jane kii ranneeti ke rup main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 Input from IANS congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne uttar pradesh ke pichhadepan ke liye gaiyr congressi sarkaron ko jimmedaar tehraate hue kaha ki ab pradesh kii tasviir badalane kaa vakt aa gaya he
 Addressing a public meeting in Moradabad on Friday, Sonia said, "the Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ruled here for more than two decades
 is dauraan inhone jaat-paat kii raajnneeti karke pradesh ko badahaali ke kagaar par pahunchaa diya
 'sonia said,' These parties had nothing to do with development
 aise main inke satta main rahete uttar pradesh ke vikaas kii ummid nahin kii ja sakati
 He said that it is necessary to bring Congress for the development and progress of Uttar Pradesh, as it is a party of every caste and class and has a golden history of service and development
 basapa pramukh mayawati par nishaanaa sadhate hue congress adhyaksh ne kaha, 'vikaas ke liye uttar pradesh main badlaav jaruri he
 Now the time has come to cut 'mayajaal'
 'mukhyamantri mayawati dwaara congress-nit centre sarkaar par lagaae gaye bhedbhaav ke aaropon kaa jawaab dete hue sonia ne kaha, 'sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) sarkaar desh ke har rajya ko ek najar se dekhati he or vah nitiyaan evam yojanaayen lagu karte samay kabhi yah nahin dekhati ki kis rajya main kis raajnneetik dal kii sarkaar he
 ' uttar pradesh main sonia gandhi (sonia Gandhi) kii raibareli seat hi congress ke liye sabase surakshit maani jaati rahi he
 This time in the Lok Sabha elections too, the Congress, despite doing very poorly here, has defeated BJP candidate Dinesh Singh by a margin of 1 lakh
 lekin pichhali baar kii tulana main congress kii jeet kaa antar ghat gaya he
 Actually, the condition of the Congress here was seen to worsen with the 2017 assembly elections
 loksabhaa seat main paanch vidhansabha siten hai jinamein se do congress, do bijepi or ek samaajawaadee party ke paas thi
 The BJP wants to demolish Sonia's stronghold in Rae Bareli
 iske pehle usne gandhi parivaar ke bahut kareebi maane jane vaale congress ke emele dinesh singh ko bijepi jwine karwaai thi
 Dinesh Singh's younger brother Awadhesh Singh is a Congress MLA from Harchandpur seat in Rae Bareli
 unke bade bhai ke bijepi main jane ke baad ve bhi bijepi ke saath hi maane ja rahe hai
 But even after all these political upheavals in the region, the Congress had a trump card which was lying alone on all the Bahubalis in the district
 vah the raibareli sadar se purv vidhayak or bahubali netaa akhilesh singh
 The current Sadar MLA Aditi Singh is his daughter
 akhilesh singh raibareli sadar se ajey vidhayak rahe hai
 In order to defeat them, the Congress tried many times to win, but could not succeed
 iske baad akhilesh singh ko congress main shaamil karaayaa gaya
 The Congress benefited from this and due to Akhilesh Singh's influence in the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress got unilateral votes from Sadar in Rae Bareli which greatly increased the margin of victory of Sonia Gandhi
 lekin kuch din pehle hi beemaari ke chalate akhilesh singh kaa nidhan ho gaya
 When Akhilesh Singh lived, he was seen trying to dominate his rival Aditi Singh in the district
 kuch din pehle hi raibareli lakhanu road par aditi singh par ek kathith hamale kii bhi ghatana hui
 Its echo was heard till Delhi and Priyanka Gandhi also opposed this incident
 is ghatana ke baad aditi singh ko bhi samaj aa gaya ki jile ke badalte samikarnon ke bich yahaan kii raajnneeti ko dilli ke netaaon ko bharose nahin thama ja saktaa he
 Aditi Singh, who is believed to be Priyanka Gandhi's biggest hand in bringing politics, declared an open rebellion from her
 2 oktober yani gandhi jayanti ke din lakhanu main priyanka gandhi kii aguwai main congress kaa march tha jisko lekar congress ne hvip bhi jari kiya tha
 On the other hand, a 36-hour assembly session was called by the Yogi government, which was boycotted by the entire opposition
 lekin aditi singh ne apni party kii hvip ko najrandaaj kar vidhansabha satr main hissaa liya
 When he was questioned on this, instead of giving a direct answer, he said, 'I did what i thought was right
 party kaa kya nirnay hoga mujhe nahin maaloom
 i am a educated young MLA
 vikaas kaa mudda bada mudda he
 This is a true tribute to Gandhiji
 'maujuuda samay raibareli kii 5 vidhansabha siton main se do congress, do bijepi or ek samaajawaadee party ke paas thi
 But since Dinesh Singh's entry into BJP, his brother who is an MLA from Harchandpur is also considered in BJP in a way
 yani chaar vidhayak pehle se hi bijepi ke khate main hai
 The number of mlas will increase to 5 if Aditi Singh leaves
 is loksabhaa chunaav main jeet kaa antar dekhte hue aisa lagata he ki aditi singh kaa bijepi main janaa congress ke liye sabase bada khatra hoga

 He soon got the advantage when Dan Faux moved in with the ball in the 42nd minute of the match and he drove it towards goal by captain Barry Middleton who ducked the goalkeeper and Jackson scored it as soon as he got the chance

 However, in this match Indian batting once again looked in trouble
 salaami ballebaaj keel rahul apni pari ko bade score main badalane main naakaam rahe or set hone ke baad bhi 48 ran banaakar apana wicket ganvaa diya
 KL Rahul got the chance to bat in all 5 matches in this World Cup, but he failed to convert his score into a big total even after settling at the crease
 paanch pariyon main unhone sabase zyada ran pakistan ke khilaaf banaae
 Even after being set against Pakistan, he went on to score 57 runs in 78 balls
 iske alaava guuruuvaar ko khele gaye match main bhi wo 48 ranon kii majboot pari ko bade score main badalane main naakaam rahe
 Apart from this, Rahul could score 26 runs against South Africa and 30 against Afghanistan

 com / mqyplacqtb — Cricket World Cup (@cricketworldcup) June 27, 2019 Not only this, his batting did not show aggression like Shikhar Dhawan
 dhawan ne jab bhi ballebaaji kii he unke ran or gend main zyada antar nahin rahaa
 At the same time, they have proved successful in turning a good start into a big total
 lekin rahul kii ballebaaji main wo chamak or teji najar nahin aati
 If you look at the innings played in KL Rahul's World Cup, then you will find that his strike rate is not above 100 or above in any match except one match
 jis match main unka strike rate 100 se zyada kaa rahaa usamen unhone majah 3 gendon kaa saamana kiya or 11 ran banaae the
 KL Rahul's performance in World Cup 2019> Against South Africa- 26 runs in 42 balls> Against Australia- 11 not out in 3 balls> Against Pakistan- 57 runs in 78 balls> Against Afghanistan- 30 runs in 53 balls > Against West Indies - 48 runs in 64 balls, it is natural to question KL Rahul's batting as an opener
 dekhnaa hoga ki 30 june ko hone vaale mukaable main kohli ek baar phir keel par bharosa jataate hai yaa phir koi pherbadal hoga
 Because England's team is considered strong and if England score 300 or above while batting first, then Indian openers will have to perform better game

 ' Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Thursday that Pakistan should understand that borders with India cannot be drawn again and Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of this country
 jetali ne pakistan kii taraf dosti kaa haath badhaate hue 1999 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kii aitihaasik lahore bas yatra kaa bhi zikr kiya or kaha ki padosi nahin badale ja sakate, unke saath sambandh badale ja sakate hai
 Addressing the civil society conference organized by the BJP, Jaitley said, "our neighboring country has to understand that they will not be able to gain any part of this country by adopting any method
 samay badal gaya he, jab desh kii simaaen badal sakati thim
 The boundaries cannot be changed now
 simaaen jas kii tas rahengi
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘ek cheez main spasht karuunga ki desh main rahane vaale sabhi logon ko jammu-kashmir ko is desh kaa abhinn ang sweekaar karnaa hoga
 '' jetali ne dilli-lahore bas se yatra kar pakistan pahunche vaajapeyi ke bhaashan kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki bharat ko ummid thi ki islamabad is pahal kaa sangyaan legaa
 Jaitley said, "vajpayee took the initiative when he went to Lahore by bus
 unhone pakistan kii taraf dosti kaa haath badhaayaa or pakistan main die gaye bhaashan main unhone kaha ki itihaas badal saktaa he, bhugol nahin badal saktaa
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘padosi padosi rahegaa lekin us desh se sambandh- achche yaa bure - badal sakate hai
 At that time too, we expected the same response to the initiative
 ’’ Without naming Pakistan, Jaitley said that resorting to terrorism to implement its policies will not provide any benefit as violence is not acceptable globally
 unhone kaha ki isse nipatane ke liye bharat ne bhi apni kshamta ko majboot kiya he
 He said that India lives on one-sixth of the world's population and has emerged as a military and economic force
 aatankwaad, ugravad yaa hinsa ke prayog se badlaav nahin ho saktaa
 The Finance Minister said, "there are two reasons
 jo log bandook kaa sahaara lete hai unhen samajhnaa hoga ki pichley kuch dashak se bandook se nipatane kii bharat kii kshamta badi he
 "even globally, no one is willing to support or listen to those who want to achieve anything on the strength of guns," he said
 hinsa sweekaarya nahin he
 '' algaavvaad ke raste par chalane vaale logon se vaarta kii sambhaavna ko nakaarte hue unhone kaha ki centre khule dil se aise kisi bhi vyakti se vaarta karne ko taiyaar he jo is raste ko chodta he
 "it should be clear that we welcome those who are being confused and want to return (to the mainstream), leave the path of isolationism and strengthen the country," he said
 ’’ Begusarai in north Bihar, located on the eastern bank of the Ganges river, is also known by the names of 'leningrad of Bihar' and 'little Moscow' and is once again drawing the attention of the country, because the Communist Party of India (CPI) ) Has fielded its firebrand leader Kanhaiya Kumar in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections from this seat
 vahiin bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ne apane sheersh bhoomihaar netaa va kendriya mantri giriraaj singh ko unke khilaaf tikat diya he
 Amidst all this, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Mahagathbandhan candidate Tanvir Hasan has not been able to attract much media attention, but his presence has made the contest triangular
 hasan ne saath hi bhaajapa virdohi voton ko hasil karne ke kanhaiya ke maukey par bhi pani pher diya he
 With Hassan in the fray, anti-bjp votes can be split between the RJD and the CPI
 kanhaiya kumaar ko sabase zyada isi baat kaa nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he yani bijepi virdohi voton ke vibhaajan kaa
 An analysis suggests that Kanhaiya had a good chance of surprising the BJP if the contest was between the two
 yuva netaa ke rup main kanhaiya ke ubharne se bhakpa ko uske pratidwandvi ke khilaaf aashaa jaagi thi or party ne unhen apana ummidavaar banaaya tha
 After the JNU incident, Kanhaiya has got the tag of alleged 'seditionist' and it is for this reason that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah have decided to field Giriraj Singh, while Singh re-elected from Nawada
 Had expressed a desire to fight giriraaj singh navada se chunaav ladane kii jid kar rahe the, lekin rajg sahyogiyon ke bich seat bantwaare main yah seat lojpa ke kheme main jane se unhen begusarai se ladane ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 In 2014, Bhola Singh of BJP won the seat by defeating Tanveer Hasan by more than 58 thousand votes
 bholaa singh purv bhakpa netaa the, jo bhaajapa main shaamil ho gaye the
 34
 31 fisadi vot hissedari ke saath hasan ko kareeb 370,000 vot mili the, jabaki bholaa singh ko 39
 It had 428,000 votes with a vote share of 72 per cent
 bhakpa ke rajendra prasad singh ko 17
 Nearly 200,000 votes were polled with 87 per cent of the votes
 anumaan ke mutabik, begusarai ke 19 lakh matadaataaon main bhoomihaar matadaata kareeb 19 fisadi, 15 fisadi muslim, 12 fisadi yadav or saat fisadi kurmi hai
 Bhumihar votes are the main link here and there is evidence that Bhumihar mps have been elected nine times in at least 11 of the last 16 Lok Sabha elections
 2009 main antim parisemen se pehle begusarai jile main do sansadeey siten begusarai or baliya seat thim
 Then both of them were merged with Begusarai and Ballia seat ended
 begusarai jile kii saat vidhansabha siton main se paanch baliya main aati hai
 Both Giriraj and Kanhaiya are Bhumihars and it will now be seen who gets the maximum support from their caste
 giriraaj singh kii bhoomihaar, savarno, kurmi or ati pichhadaa varg par acchhee pakad he, jabaki rajd muslim, yadav or pichhadi jati ke votaron ko apane khemen main kiye hue he

 He also remained behind bars for several days
 chaar saal baad 33 saal ke varun gandhi bedaag hai
 The BJP made him the general secretary, presenting him as the Gandhi face of the party parallel to Rahul Gandhi
 lekin bada sawaal ye he ki court se kaise bedaag batch nikle varun gandhi? varun ke khilaaf kaise mukar gaye saare gavaah? isi bare main tahalaka-ajtak ne kiya he bada khulaasa
 Of course, no witness was found in the court that Varun Gandhi actually gave hate speeches in Dalchand and Barkheda in 2009
 lekin tahalaka-ajtak ke sting oparation main saaf ho gaya ki na sirf varun ne jehar ugalane vaala bhaashan diya tha, balki mukademe se bedaag bachane ke liye puri nyaay prakriya ko tod-marod daalaa
 See how the district BJP vice-president of Pilibhit, Parmeshwari Dayal Gangwar (PG), is revealing the secret of turning witnesses in a hidden camera

 i went to that date
 sting oparation se khulaasa hua ki varun ne nyaay prakriya ko is had tak prabhavit kiya ki in donon cese ke alaava duusare kuch maamalon ke sabhi 88 gavaah mukar gaye
 This can be a record in any criminal history
 haalanki tahalaka ke chhipe hue camere main kai gavaah ye sweekaar karte najar aae ki paise dekar unka bayaan badalawaaya gaya
 According to witnesses, SP Amit Verma and other policemen played an important role in changing the statement
 dekhie kaise hua bayaan badalane kaa khel
 
 
 Yameen: Captain sir was involved in this
 
 
 captain sahab ne bayaan badalawaae hai

 How the lawyers recorded the statements in their own way and how they did not cross-examine them
 yahaan tak ki gavaahi ke liye kaiyon ko bulaane kii jahamat bhi nahin uthaai gai

 From the sting operation, it was revealed that in order to save himself spotless, Varun got his party's candidate defeated in the UP Assembly elections, so that the Samajwadi Party leaders could win the elections and help them avoid the case
 mahaj do din ke bheetar 18 gavaah pesh kiye gaye
 All retracted the old statement, but the government lawyer or the court did not object to it
 yahi nahin, jab varun ne aawaaj kaa namoona dene se inkaar kiya, to sarkari vakil jhatpat is par raji ho gaye
 Many important witnesses were not produced at all, because the public prosecutor himself petitioned that his appearance was not needed

 gadwa kii police adheekshak shivani tiwari ne bataaya ki police ghatana kii chaanbin kar rahi he or sabhi ke shavon ko antya pareekshan ke liye le gaya he
 Only after the report came, something can be said in detail about the incident
 unhone bataaya ki ghatnasthal se note bhi baraamad hua he jisamen likhaa gaya he ki puraa parivaar swechha se aatmahatya kar rahaa he
 According to police, Shivkumar Baitha, a resident of Raxi, killed his wife Babita Devi (26), daughter Tanya Kumari (10) and Shreya Kumari (6), dumped the body in a well and committed suicide by hanging himself from a tree
 police ne bataaya ki ghatana kii jaankaree tab hui jab subah shiv kumaar kii maa uske ghar gai or uske ghar kaa darwaja khulaa tha
 Shivakumar's body was swinging on the guava tree, located a little away from home
 maa ke rone or chillane par jamaa hue gaanv ke logon ne or logon kii khojbin kii or anya shavon ko kuen se nikaala
 Initially, only the body of Shivkumar and a baby girl was found

 Seeing the incident, people feared that some wife and child have also been murdered
 logon ne is lihaaj aas paas ke kuen main khojbin shuru kii to duusari bacchee or patni kaa shav kuen main mili
 According to the villagers Shivkumar Baitha had a lot of debt

 Meanwhile, Superintendent of Police Shivani Tiwari said that a preliminary inquiry has revealed a debt of two to two and a half lakh rupees on Shivkumar

 Denying all these news, now a statement has come from the director of the film, Raj Shandalya

 This concept came to Raj's mind when it was the era of Orkut and Yahoo Messenger
 fasebuk baad main aayaa
 At that time the trend of creating a fake account also came
 jaise ki anjal priya
 There were also pictures of girls on these accounts
 kuch samay baad saamne waalon ko is baat kaa andaja ho jaataa tha ki ve apana time west kar rahe hai
 After this, those with fake accounts confess that they were not any girls

 Obviously, the scope has increased, so the responsibility of management has also gone into the account of the professionals and big sponsors have also started coming up to bear the expenses
 itnaa sab ho or uske baad party na ho, aisa kaise ho saktaa he
 That's why Delhi University vice-chancellor Dinesh Singh says, "these festivals give students a platform to showcase their skills

 It includes everything from breathtaking names to glowing stage, hitech equipment and lots of desi masala

 The National Medical Commission will be set up in the next 3 years after the bill is passed
 pradhanmantri ne neshnal kamishan bill ko lekar ieenes se kaha ki ise lekar kai vivaad bhi rahe hai or sarkaar inase nipati bhi he
 For example, there is a case of medical reform, the response of which is not good in the common people
 medical sudhaar par kai hisson se aapattiyaan uthi hai
 Do you think that the changes you have made have been done carefully? On this question, he said without delay, “when we formed the government in 2014, there were many concerns about the current system of medical education
 isse pehle, adaalaton ne bharat main medical shiksha ko sambhaal rahi sansthaaon ke khilaaf kade shabdon main aapatti darj karai thi, inhen bhrashtachar kaa garh kaha tha
 a parliamentary committee had presented a disappointing picture of medical education after intensive study
 usne kuprabandhan, paardarshita kii kami, manamaanepan kaa ullekh kiya tha
 Earlier governments had thought about improving the region, but they could not move forward in this direction
 hamane is disha main aag badhane kaa faisla kiya, kyonki yah maamla aisa nahin he, jise halke main liya jaae
 It is related to the health of our people and the future of our youth
 isliye, hamane visheshgyon kaa ek samooh yah dekhne ke liye banaaya ki samasya kahaan he
 The expert group studied the system closely and identified problems and areas of improvement
 yah visheshgyon ke suzav hai, jise ham maujuuda vidheyak main lekar aae hai
 At a time when the countries of the world are looking towards India to speed up development in the world, we realized that this can only happen with a healthy population
 garib logon ko garibi ke dushchakr se mukt karnaa behad jaruri he, jise sehat sambandhi samasyaayein sthaayee bana detii hai
 The NMC also serves this purpose
 yah desh main medical shiksha ke kshetra ke prabandhan main paardarshita, javabdehi or gunvattta ko sunishchit karegaa
 Its goal is to reduce the burden on students, increase medical seats, reduce the cost of medical education
 iskaa matlab yah he ki or adhik pratibhavan yuva medicine ko ek peshey ke rup main apana sakenge or isse medical peshewaron kii sankhya ko badhaane main madad milegi
 Ayushman Bharat is about to bring revolution in the field of medical care
 ye jaagrukta badha rahaa he, saath hi gunvatttapurna chikitsa suvidha ko pahunch ke daayre main laa rahaa he

 2016 main emsiai par bani stading cameti ne kaha ki emsiai kaa sara focus collejon ko license dene par rahata he jisase padhai kii gunvattta prabhavit hoti he
 MCI dissolved in 2017 Based on the objections, the central government started preparing for the formation of NMC by dissolving MCI in 2017
 2017 main supreme court ne emsiai kii gatividhiyon par najar rakhane ke liye nigaraanee cameti banaai thi
 The Monitoring Committee had then told the Ministry of Health that MCI was in violation of the orders of the Supreme Court

 There is also a provision in this bill that ayurveda-homeopathy doctors will be able to take allopathic treatment by doing bridge course
 jabaki doctoron kaa kahana he ki isse neem-hakim or jholachhap doctoron ko badhaava milegaa
 Private medical colleges will get the right to fix fees for 50 percent seats, while doctors say that this will lead to corruption in private medical colleges
 praavdhaan ke anusaar padhai puri karne ke baad practice shuru karne ke liye doctoron ko ek test paas karnaa hoga
 On the other hand, doctors say that once the test fails, there is no option to give the test again
 ye rahaa he sarkaar kaa pakshasarkaar kaa kahana he ki neshnal medical kamishan desh main doctoron kii kami ko dur karne main sakasham hoga
 The government argues that with the introduction of this bill, primary health workers will get a license to practice after doing a 6-month medical course
 jisase ve ilaaj or dawaai likh sakenge
 This will provide considerable relief to the people in rural areas
 brij course ke jariye simit allopathy practice kaa adhikaar sirf un aayush doctoron ko milegaa jinke paas practice kaa license ho

 Today at 10 am Vividh Bharati's FM channel 100
 10 par achaanak manaregaa kaa gaanaa bajane laga
 The program has been sponsored by the Ministry of Rural Development, which has two facilitators
 vikaas or bharti
 Vikas has the answer to all his sorrows and Bharti is saddened to go to his brother's job
 vikaas samajhaata he ki mil jaaegi, lekin socho, gaanvon main lakhon logon ko kaam nahin miltaa he, isliye sarkaar ne 2005 ke ek kanoon se manaregaa banaaya he
 There is a law, not an MNREGA program
 is kanoon ke tahat koi bhi apane sarpanch se kaam maang saktaa he or 15 din main kaam nahin mila to use berojgaare bhatta bhi milegaa
 Through development, this program starts telling the purpose of MNREGA
 bharti vikaas kii in baton se hairaan hoti he ki manaregaa main kaam tabhi milegaa, jab koi kaam maangega
 Work is not available on luck
 iske baad vikaas bharti ko sumer or sumati kii katha sunaata he
 The story begins on the lines of Satyanarayana Puja that Sumer and Sumati were upset due to lack of work
 unhen lagata he ki manaregaa main sarampach ke logon ko hi kaam miltaa he, isliye sarpanch ke paas jane ke bajaae sumer shahar jaakar kaam karegaa
 Sarpanch Sahib sees both of them going out and says why are you going out when you can ask for work
 gram sabha main aakar ek form bhar jaao, tumhen koi na koi kaam to milegaa hi, lekin kaam tabhi milegaa jab maangoge
 This program of MNREGA while driving a car on Delhi's road also took some time for political controversies related to it
 ghar aakar main google karne laga
 The MGNREGA, which the Prime Minister had mocked as a program of digging the pit, in this program of his government, there is a song about MNREGA that now the path of development village
 vikaas bharti ko kahata he ki agar indira awaas yojana ke tahat kisi kaa ghar ban rahaa ho to usamen bhi manaregaa ke chalate mazaduri mil sakati he
 Whatever may be the politics, survival of the MNREGA is more important
 mujhe to yah kaarykram acha laga
 Just through this, it is also told that from how much wages will be received, where will we get unemployment allowance, in how many days, what are the rights of the workers
 khabaren aati rahati hai ki manaregaa kii puri mazaduri bhi nahin milti he
 The copywriter has presented MGNREGA wages as if it were the salary of a CEO rather than the minimum wage
 manaregaa kii mazaduri ko behatar zindagi se aise joda ja rahaa he, jaise sumer or sumati noida ekstansion main flats book kara lenge
 Copywriters should understand that MNREGA is just a program of basic need
 saal main sau din ke rojgaar se kisi kii zindagi behatar nahin hoti, uskaa kaam zarur chal jaataa he
 The government should tell what the laborers can do if they do not get the full wages of MNREGA
 modi sarkaar ne manaregaa main pichley vitt varsh kii tulana main 12 pratishat zyaada paisa diya he - 34,669 karod
 When Google did, another news came out
 7 may ko loksabhaa main 15 vipakshi saansadon ne sarkaar se kaha ki manaregaa kaa paisa rajyon ko jaldi bheja jaae
 Rural Development Minister Virendra Singh replied that Rs 12,000 crore had been sent, but the matter of giving unemployment allowance if work is not available is the responsibility of the state government
 loksabhaa main congress ke mallikarjun khadge ne kaha ki rajasthan or madhya pradesh ne bhi shikaayat kii he ki centre se paisa nahin mil rahaa he
 We do not know who is telling the truth
 isi saal 23 april kii agency kii khabar he ki manaregaa ke tahat 2014-15 main kaarydiwas pichley saal kii tulana main 46 se kam hokar 40 ho gaye hai, jabaki hone chahie 100 din
 The Union Minister of State for Rural Development said in the Lok Sabha that this has happened because MNREGA is a demand-driven program
 kai kaarnon se maang main kami ai he
 All this was told that extreme optimism about MNREGA should be avoided
 sarkari kaaryakramon ko bhi vyaavhaarik dharaatal par banaaya janaa chahie
 Critics may be happy that the government is adopting the MNREGA
 ab vah manaregaa ko upie se jodakar nahin dekhati he, isliye vividh bharti ke pryojit kaarykram main pehle hi kaha jaataa he ki yah varsh 2005 kaa kanoon he
 Even this honesty does not diminish
 pradhanmantri ne desh ke kisaanon ke liye kisaan tivi launch kiya he
 This is a good step, i wish this channel is successful
 maine prasar bharti ke chairman e suryaprakash se baat bhi kii
 He informed that the prices of one thousand mandis of the country on the farmers channel will run on the bottom lines along the lines of the business channel
 desh ke kisaanon ko ek saath or ek hi samay main pataa chal jayega
 Apart from this, weather information will be given in collaboration with Meteorological Department
 mausam par rose aadhe ghante kaa kaarykram bhi hoga
 The farmer will even be told that the weather in Bulandshahr or Panipat is fine and they can sow from next week
 mausam vibhaag ke paas desh ke har zile ke paanch dinon kaa anumaan hota he
 Suryaprakash said that we have formed a new team for this and the entire focus will be on seeing agriculture through the glasses of the farmer
 is channel kii kamyaabi bahut kuch is baat par nirbhar karegi ki sarkaar iske jariye kisaanon ko vaikalpik kheti ke liye kaise protsaahit karti he
 There is also the promise of organic farming by the Modi government, which is not even heard of
 ek hi ashanka he ki kahin yah channel bahurashtriya companiyon ke beej or takanic ke hatkande kaa shikaar na ho jaae, kyonki yah desh kaa pehla channel he, jo sidhe kisaanon se baat karegaa
 Apart from this serious apprehension, there is more hope from the farmers channel
 ummid kii jaani chahie ki is par krishi nitiyon par khulkar bahes hogi
 Even before this, many people have tried to get a newspaper related to farming
 maharashtra main 'sakaal group' kaa ek krishi akhbaar he 'agro van', jise kisaan sahejkar rakhte hai
 Many correspondents working in it are agricultural graduates
 isi tarah akola se 'krishakonnati' naam se ek akhbaar nikal rahaa he
 Lyricist Nilesh Misra also publishes newspapers in the name of 'village Connection' (disclaimer - i also have a column in it)
 kheti, kisaani or gaanv par jor dene kii zarurat he
 The comments main rang main bhang nahin daalana chahta, lekin pradhanmantri ke haath main hal kii tasviir dekhakar laga ki yah vahi hal to nahin, jo ramlila maidan main rahul gandhi ko diya gaya tha
 The mention of the continuity of the plow's presence on political platforms was so much to show that the plow is no longer the identity of the farmer
 kai gaanvon main to hal dikhegaa bhi nahin
 Chandrabhan Prasad has shown through his research that the plow is over in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh
 iskaa ek mahatv he
 Both political and economic
 hal ke saath-saath harvaahee bhi mit gai he
 No matter how many farmers and farmers we do in the name of plow, the truth is that the plow farmers used to be Dalits and they were not treated equally
 isliye pradhanmantri narendra modi or rahul gandhi donon agali baar jab kheti kaa koi kaarykram karen to hal na thaamen
 The solution is no longer the solution
 'upkaar' film main manoj kumaar ne hal uthaakar ise rashtravaadi pratik main badal to diya or laal bahadur shastri ke 'jai jawan jai kisaan' ke naare ke daur main hal kuch partiyon kaa simbel bhi ban gaya, magar hal or hal-chhap vaali partiyaan donon mit chuke hai
 The plow and the harrow are a picture of exploitation of our society, not of greatness
 bharti vikaas kii in baton se hairaan hoti he ki manaregaa main kaam tabhi milegaa, jab koi kaam maangega
 Work is not available on luck
 iske baad vikaas bharti ko sumer or sumati kii katha sunaata he
 The story begins on the lines of Satyanarayana Puja that Sumer and Sumati were upset due to lack of work
 unhen lagata he ki manaregaa main sarampach ke logon ko hi kaam miltaa he, isliye sarpanch ke paas jane ke bajaae sumer shahar jaakar kaam karegaa
 Sarpanch Sahib sees both of them going out and says why are you going out when you can ask for work
 gram sabha main aakar ek form bhar jaao, tumhen koi na koi kaam to milegaa hi, lekin kaam tabhi milegaa jab maangoge
 This program of MNREGA while driving a car on Delhi's road also took some time for political controversies related to it
 ghar aakar main google karne laga
 The MGNREGA, which the Prime Minister had mocked as a program of digging the pit, in this program of his government, there is a song about MNREGA that now the path of development village
 vikaas bharti ko kahata he ki agar indira awaas yojana ke tahat kisi kaa ghar ban rahaa ho to usamen bhi manaregaa ke chalate mazaduri mil sakati he
 Whatever may be the politics, survival of the MNREGA is more important
 mujhe to yah kaarykram acha laga
 Just through this, it is also told that from how much wages will be received, where will we get unemployment allowance, in how many days, what are the rights of the workers
 khabaren aati rahati hai ki manaregaa kii puri mazaduri bhi nahin milti he
 The copywriter has presented MGNREGA wages as if it were the salary of a CEO rather than the minimum wage
 manaregaa kii mazaduri ko behatar zindagi se aise joda ja rahaa he, jaise sumer or sumati noida ekstansion main flats book kara lenge
 Copywriters should understand that MNREGA is just a program of basic need
 saal main sau din ke rojgaar se kisi kii zindagi behatar nahin hoti, uskaa kaam zarur chal jaataa he
 The government should tell what the laborers can do if they do not get the full wages of MNREGA
 modi sarkaar ne manaregaa main pichley vitt varsh kii tulana main 12 pratishat zyaada paisa diya he - 34,669 karod
 When Google did, another news came out
 7 may ko loksabhaa main 15 vipakshi saansadon ne sarkaar se kaha ki manaregaa kaa paisa rajyon ko jaldi bheja jaae
 Rural Development Minister Virendra Singh replied that Rs 12,000 crore had been sent, but the matter of giving unemployment allowance if work is not available is the responsibility of the state government
 loksabhaa main congress ke mallikarjun khadge ne kaha ki rajasthan or madhya pradesh ne bhi shikaayat kii he ki centre se paisa nahin mil rahaa he
 We do not know who is telling the truth
 isi saal 23 april kii agency kii khabar he ki manaregaa ke tahat 2014-15 main kaarydiwas pichley saal kii tulana main 46 se kam hokar 40 ho gaye hai, jabaki hone chahie 100 din
 The Union Minister of State for Rural Development said in the Lok Sabha that this has happened because MNREGA is a demand-driven program
 kai kaarnon se maang main kami ai he
 All this was told that extreme optimism about MNREGA should be avoided
 sarkari kaaryakramon ko bhi vyaavhaarik dharaatal par banaaya janaa chahie
 Critics may be happy that the government is adopting the MNREGA
 ab vah manaregaa ko upie se jodakar nahin dekhati he, isliye vividh bharti ke pryojit kaarykram main pehle hi kaha jaataa he ki yah varsh 2005 kaa kanoon he
 Even this honesty does not diminish
 pradhanmantri ne desh ke kisaanon ke liye kisaan tivi launch kiya he
 This is a good step, i wish this channel is successful
 maine prasar bharti ke chairman e suryaprakash se baat bhi kii
 He informed that the prices of one thousand mandis of the country on the farmers channel will run on the bottom lines along the lines of the business channel
 desh ke kisaanon ko ek saath or ek hi samay main pataa chal jayega
 Apart from this, weather information will be given in collaboration with Meteorological Department
 mausam par rose aadhe ghante kaa kaarykram bhi hoga
 The farmer will even be told that the weather in Bulandshahr or Panipat is fine and they can sow from next week
 mausam vibhaag ke paas desh ke har zile ke paanch dinon kaa anumaan hota he
 Suryaprakash said that we have formed a new team for this and the entire focus will be on seeing agriculture through the glasses of the farmer
 is channel kii kamyaabi bahut kuch is baat par nirbhar karegi ki sarkaar iske jariye kisaanon ko vaikalpik kheti ke liye kaise protsaahit karti he
 There is also the promise of organic farming by the Modi government, which is not even heard of
 ek hi ashanka he ki kahin yah channel bahurashtriya companiyon ke beej or takanic ke hatkande kaa shikaar na ho jaae, kyonki yah desh kaa pehla channel he, jo sidhe kisaanon se baat karegaa
 Apart from this serious apprehension, there is more hope from the farmers channel
 ummid kii jaani chahie ki is par krishi nitiyon par khulkar bahes hogi
 Even before this, many people have tried to get a newspaper related to farming
 maharashtra main 'sakaal group' kaa ek krishi akhbaar he 'agro van', jise kisaan sahejkar rakhte hai
 Many correspondents working in it are agricultural graduates
 isi tarah akola se 'krishakonnati' naam se ek akhbaar nikal rahaa he
 Lyricist Nilesh Misra also publishes newspapers in the name of 'village Connection' (disclaimer - i also have a column in it)
 kheti, kisaani or gaanv par jor dene kii zarurat he

 dilli kii sadak par car chalaate-chalaate manaregaa kaa yah kaarykram thodi der ke liye isse jude raajnneetik vivaadon main bhi le gaya
 After coming home, i started to google
 jis manaregaa ko pradhanmantri ne gadde khudwane kaa kaarykram kahkar mazaaq udaaya tha, unheen kii sarkaar ke is kaarykram main manaregaa ko lekar gaanaa he ki ab chalaa vikaas gaanv kii raah
 Vikas tells Bharti that if someone's house is being built under Indira Awaas Yojana, then wages can also be got due to MNREGA
 raajnneeti jo bhi ho, manaregaa kaa bachaa rahanaa zyaada zaruri he
 i liked this program
 bas, iske jariye yah bhi bataaya jaataa ki kitni mazaduri milegi, berojgaare bhatta kahaan se milegaa, kitne din main milegaa, mazaduron ke adhikaar kya hai
 There are reports that MNREGA does not even get full wages
 copiriter ne manaregaa kii mazaduri ko aise pesh kiya he, jaise yah nunatam mazaduri na hokar kisi siio kii tankhwaah ho
 MNREGA wages are being linked to better lives, such as Sumer and Sumati will book flats in Noida Extension
 copiraiteron ko samajhnaa chahie ki manaregaa sirf buniyadi zarurat kaa kaarykram he
 a hundred days a year does not improve one's life, his work is definitely done
 sarkaar ko bataanaa chahie ki manaregaa kii puri mazaduri na milane par mazdoor kya kar saktaa he
 The Modi government has given 12 percent more money - 34,669 crore in the MNREGA compared to the previous financial year
 google kiya to ek or khabar nikal ai
 On May 7, 15 opposition mps in the Lok Sabha asked the government to send the money of MNREGA to the states soon
 gramin vikaas mantri virendra singh ne jawaab diya ki 12,000 karod rupee bheje ja chuke hai, lekin kaam na milane par berojgaare bhatta dene kii baat he, vah rajya sarkaar kii zimmedaari he
 Mallikarjun Kharge of Congress in Lok Sabha said that Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have also complained that money is not being received from the Center
 hamen nahin pataa chal rahaa he ki sach koun bol rahaa he
 The agency reported on 23 April this year that under MGNREGA, workdays in 2014-15 have been reduced from 46 to 40 as compared to the previous year, whereas 100 days should be done
 kendriya gramin vikaas rajyamantri ne loksabhaa main kaha ki aisa isliye hua he ki manaregaa maang par aadhaarit kaarykram he
 Demand has declined for several reasons
 yah sab isliye bataaya ki manaregaa ko lekar ati ashavad se bachanaa chahie
 Government programs should also be built on practical ground
 aalochak is baat se khush ho sakate hai ki sarkaar manaregaa ko apnaane lagi he
 Now she does not see MNREGA as associated with UPA, so Vividh Bharati sponsored program is already said that this is the 2005 law
 itani eemaandaaree bhi kam nahin hoti
 The Prime Minister has launched Kisan TV for the farmers of the country
 yah ek acha kadam he, meri dua he ki yah channel safal ho
 i also spoke to Prasar Bharati chairman a Suryaprakash
 unhone bataaya ki kisaan channel par desh ke ek hazaar mandiyon ke bhav bijness channel kii tarj par neeche kii pattiyon par chalaa karenge
 The farmers of the country will come to know together and at the same time
 iske alaava mausam vibhaag ke sahyog se mausam kii jaankaree di jaaegi
 There will also be a half-hour program daily on the weather
 kisaan ko yahaan tak bataaya jayega ki bulandshahr yaa panipat main mausam thik he or ve agle hafte se buvaai kar sakate hai
 The Meteorological Department has an estimate of five days in every district of the country
 suryaprakash ne kaha ki hamane iske liye nai team banaai he or puraa focus is baat par hoga ki kisaan ke chashme se kheti ko dekha jaae
 The success of this channel will depend a lot on how the government encourages farmers for alternative farming through this
 modi sarkaar kaa argenic kheti kaa vaada bhi he, jisaki charchaa bhi sunai nahin detii he
 There is only apprehension that this channel may not fall prey to the seeds and technology tactics of multinational companies, as it is the first channel in the country that will talk directly to the farmers
 is gambhir ashanka se alaava kisaan channel se ummid hi zyaada he
 It is to be hoped that this will be openly debated on agricultural policies
 isse pehle bhi kai logon ne kheti se judaa akhbaar nikaalane kaa prayaas kiya he
 In Maharashtra, the 'sakal Group' has an agricultural newspaper 'agro One', which the farmers keep
 isamen kaam karne vaale kai samvaadadaata krishi-snaatak hote hai

 There is a need to emphasize farming, farming and village
 tippaniyan i do not want to disturb the color, but seeing the picture of the plow in the hands of the Prime Minister, it seemed that it was not the same solution which was given to Rahul Gandhi at Ramlila Maidan
 raajnneetik manchon par hal kii maujuudagi kii nirantarata kaa zikr itnaa bataane ke liye kiya ki hal ab kisaan kii pahchaan nahin he
 In many villages, the solution will not be seen
 chandrabhan prasad apane shodh se dikhaa chuke hai ki uttar pradesh ke purvi ilaake main hal samaapt ho chukaa he
 It has a significance
 raajnneetik or aarthik donon
 Along with the plow, the harava has also disappeared
 ham hal ke naam par kitna hi kisaan-kisaan kar len, lekin sachai yah he ki hal uthaane vaale kisaan dalit hote the or unke saath barabari kaa vyavhaar nahin hota tha
 Therefore, the next time both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi do a program of farming, do not hold a solution
 hal ab samaadhaan nahin he
 In the film 'upkar', Manoj Kumar took the plow and converted it into a nationalist symbol and in the era of Lal Bahadur Shastri's 'jai Jawan Jai Kisan', the plow also became the symbol of some parties, but the plow and plow parties Both have disappeared

 No matter how many farmers and farmers we do in the name of plow, the truth is that the plow farmers used to be Dalits and they were not treated equally

 isse pehle bhi kai logon ne kheti se judaa akhbaar nikaalane kaa prayaas kiya he
 In Maharashtra, the 'sakal Group' has an agricultural newspaper 'agro One', which the farmers keep
 isamen kaam karne vaale kai samvaadadaata krishi-snaatak hote hai
 Similarly, a newspaper named 'krishkonnati' is coming out of Akola
 geetkaar neelesh misra bhi 'gaanv conection' (disclemur - isamen meraa bhi kollam aata he) ke naam se akhbaar nikaalte hai
 There is a need to emphasize farming, farming and village
 tippaniyan i do not want to disturb the color, but seeing the picture of the plow in the hands of the Prime Minister, it seemed that it was not the same solution which was given to Rahul Gandhi at Ramlila Maidan
 raajnneetik manchon par hal kii maujuudagi kii nirantarata kaa zikr itnaa bataane ke liye kiya ki hal ab kisaan kii pahchaan nahin he
 In many villages, the solution will not be seen
 chandrabhan prasad apane shodh se dikhaa chuke hai ki uttar pradesh ke purvi ilaake main hal samaapt ho chukaa he
 It has a significance
 raajnneetik or aarthik donon
 Along with the plow, the harava has also disappeared
 ham hal ke naam par kitna hi kisaan-kisaan kar len, lekin sachai yah he ki hal uthaane vaale kisaan dalit hote the or unke saath barabari kaa vyavhaar nahin hota tha
 Therefore, the next time both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi do a program of farming, do not hold a solution
 hal ab samaadhaan nahin he
 In the film 'upkar', Manoj Kumar took the plow and converted it into a nationalist symbol and in the era of Lal Bahadur Shastri's 'jai Jawan Jai Kisan', the plow also became the symbol of some parties, but the plow and plow parties Both have disappeared

 unhone kaha ki 23 ke baad nitish kumaar istipha de denge or bijepi-jediu main ladaai hona tay he
 Former deputy CM said that after 23, Nitish Kumar and Nitish Kumar's party will remain, then you see, these people are going to disappear like dinosaurs

 aandhi main unka safaya ho jayega

 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke liye siyaasi bisaat bichaai jane lagi he
 Opposition against Modi-led BJP was looking forward to landing in 2019 with the grand alliance formula
 par kuch dinon main siyasat ne aisa rang badla ki vipaksh ekajute hone ke bajaay bikhar rahaa he
 Allies of Congress are getting away from him one by one
 pehle sapa, phir basapa or ab sipiem 2019 ke aam chunaavon main congress se talmail nahin karegi
 Let the cpm's Central Committee pass a resolution in this regard on Sunday
 sipiem ke purv mahasachiv prakaash karaat congress se kisi bhi tarah ke gathbandhan ke khilaaf hai
 At the same time, the faction led by General Secretary Sitaram Yechury is soft on joining hands with Congress to take on the BJP
 2019 main left kii raah congress se algasipiem kendriya samiti kii baithak main donon netaaon ke prastaav par voting karai gai, jisamen karaat gut ko 55 or yechuri ke paksh main 31 vot pade
 In this way the Karat faction won by a margin of 24 votes
 paas kiye gaye is prastaav ko april main hyderabad main hone vaali sipiem-congress kii baithak main aupchaarik rup se apnaane ke liye rakhaa jayega
 This is the second time voting has been done within the CPM for an alliance with the Congress or not
 donon baar yechuri gut kii haar or karaat gut kii jeet hui
 The influence of the Left is continuously decreasing in the country
 left vichaaron vaale siyaasi dal apane vajood ko bachaane kii jaddojahad kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, the Congress saw a support for CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury
 yahi vajah thi ki yechuri gut congress ke saath gathbandhan kii disha aage badhane kaa man bana rahaa tha, lekin karaat gut kii mukhaalafat ne unke saare armaanon par pani pher diya he
 The crack in the friendship of the 'boys of UP' is not only left with the Congress, but the SP is also reluctant to come together in 2019
 2017 ke upi vidhansabha chunaav main akhilesh yadav or rahul gandhi kii bani dosti main daraar padati hui najar aa rahi he
 Recently, Akhilesh had said that for 2019, i am not thinking of an alliance with any party yet
 gathbandhan or seat shering par baat kar main apana samay barbaad nahin karnaa chahta
 i do not want to be under any illusion
 abhi main sirf apni party ko majboot karne main laga hum
 Not only this, the SP has started preparing for election in all 80 seats of the state
 iskaa matlab saaf he congress or sapa ke bich raah juda ho chuki he
 BSP also made a distance from the Congress
 BSP supremo Mayawati categorically denied the alliance in the 2019 election on her 62nd birthday
 itnaa hi nahin unhone bijepi or congress donon ko nishane par liya tha
 Mayawati had said that she is seen as a thief in the Dalit oppression by Congress and BJP thieves
 donon par ghinaune hatkande va shadyantra se unki ambedkarwaadi party ko kamjor or khatm karne kaa aarope bhi lagaaya tha
 It is clear that Mayawati will enter the electoral battle alone in 2019
 jabaki mana ja rahaa tha ki 2014 ke loksabhaa or 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bispi ko mili karaari haar ke chalate wo gathbandhan kii raah apana sakati hai, lekin in saare kayaason par unhone viraam laga diya he
 He has forced everyone to guess
 basapa pramukh mayawati ne may main karnataka main ech
 D
 kumaraswami ke shapath-grahan samaaroh main upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke saath garmjoshi dikhaai
 In July, he showed a way out to a senior party leader for using derogatory language against Rahul Gandhi
 aise main unhen congress ke prati naram mana ja rahaa tha
 But on 10 September, he blamed both the BJP and the previous Congress-led government for the rising prices of petrol and diesel
 phir 20 sitambar ko unhone chhattisgarh ke aagaamee vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye ajit jogi kii party janata congress chhattisgarh (je) se gathbandhan karke congress ko jhatka de diya
 Rajnathi Shastri Ajit Kumar at Banaras Hindu University believes that Mayawati's alliance with Jogi is aimed at pressuring Congress to take more seats in the assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan
 unke mutabik, isaki ghoshnaa karne ke liye jogi ko lakhanu bulaakar unhone samaajawaadee party ke netritv ko bhi sandesh diya he, jo 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bhaajapa-virdohi morcha bananaa chahta he
 There is talk of coordination with Congress in Madhya Pradesh, but BSP state in-charge Ram Achal Rajbhar said that the party will field candidates for all 230 seats in the state
 mayawati ne rajasthan main bhi apane netaaon se kaha ki ve chhattisgarh kii tarj par sipii samet anya partiyon ke saath gathbandhan kii sambhaavnaaon kaa pataa lagaaein
 Mayawati has publicly announced that if her party is given respectable seats in the 2019 election, she can form an alliance with any party
 2014 main basapa ko uttar pradesh main ek bhi seat nahin mili thi par rajya kii 34 siton par vah duusare number par rahi thi
 According to sources, they will demand "at least 50 seats" to form a front against the BJP
 vahiin sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav ne kaha he ki ve basapa se gathbandhan jari rakhane ke liye koi bhi tyaag karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 While taunting the ruling bjp's move to release Chandrasekhar, the chief of the Bhima Army (a division of Dalit votes in western UP), Mayawati immediately dismissed the indications from Chandrasekhar
 rihaai ke baad chandrashekhar ne apane "samaan khun'' or "jati'' kaa hawala dete hue mayawati ko "buaa'' kahkar sambodhit kiya tha
 The BSP chief's answer was very flat "I have no kinship like my nephew
" '' mayawati acchhee tarah jaanati hai ki kisi anya dalit netaa (khaskar unki jatav birdari se) ke ubharne se congress or sapa se unki saudebaaji kii takat ghat jaaegi
 BSP will contest 35 seats in Chhattisgarh, there are total 90 assembly seats

 film actors rupahale parde par to aatanki se lekar super villen tak, sab se do-do haath kar lete hai, lekin ek hollywood actor real life main bhi aatankiyon se loha le rahaa he
 Hollywood actor Michael Enright, who appeared in Pirates of the Caribbean, is in Syria and is fighting militants of the IS, the Islamic State

 Meanwhile, former US Army officer Jordan Matteson has appealed to the US and Britain on Facebook to take Enright from the war zone or else its commander will kill him
 kyon vah maansik rup se biimaar hai
 He attacked the American War Veteran, who was involved in the war of Iraq, and his behavior with the Kurdish general is also very bad

 However, Inwright described all the allegations as baseless and said that Jordan Matteson is exaggerating the matter

 Michael Enright has been an artist, but the changes within him suggest that he will no longer back down
