 himalay kshetra main ek ke baad ek bukamp nahin aate
 Therefore, such reports that a major earthquake may occur in the coming days, there is no scientific basis for such reports

 Huh
 
 
 lekin is baar isisi cricket world cap 2015 main jo do bhai behtareen khel dikhaa rahe hai, ve hai nil or kevin o'bryan
 
 
 Both these brothers have done brilliantly for the Ireland team
 
 
 donon ke behtareen khel kii badaulat hi ireland world cap main badi-badi tiimon ko haraane main kaamyaab hua
 
 
 Even if Ireland is being discussed in the World Cup at the moment, it is because of these two brothers
 
 
 varsh 2007 ke world cap main bhi ireland ne bahut bada ulatpher karte hue pakistan ko haraaya tha or us match main bhi inhen bhaaiyon ne shandaar khel dikhaaya tha
 
 
 Ireland beat Pakistan by three wickets in a match played at Kingston on 17 March 2007, with Neil o'brien scoring a brilliant 72, while Kevin was not out for 16
 
 
 kshetrarakshan ke dauraan wicketiper ke rup main nathan ne do shandaar kaich lapke the or kevin ne acchhee gendbaaji karte hue chah overon main 29 ran dekar ek wicket hasil kiya tha
 
 
 Neil o'brien was also voted 'man of the Match' for his brilliant game in this match
 
 
 chaliye, ab baat karte hai varsh 2011 main hue world cap kii
 
 
 In this edition, Ireland had defeated a fantastic team like England and Kevin o'brien was also behind that win
 
 
 2 march, 2011 ko bengaluru main khele gaye is match main england ne ireland ke saamne 328 ranon kaa pahaad jaisaa lakshya rakhaa tha, jo ireland jaisi kamjor maani jane vaali team ke liye vaaki bahut bada tha
 
 
 The goal was to get even bigger when Ireland 24
 2 overon main 111 ran par paanch wicket ganvaa chuki thi
 
 
 The supporters of Ireland were disillusioned, and even the o'brien brothers' father, Brandon o'brien, was sitting down in the stands, but at the time as Kevin read his father's mind, and batting brilliantly Snatched the match from England
 
 
 chathe number par ballebaaji karne aae kevin ne 63 gendon kaa saamana kar 113 ran banaae, jinamein 13 chauke or chah chakke shaamil the, or aakhirkaar ireland ne match teen wicket se jeet liya, jisamen beshak kevin o'bryan hi 'main of da match' chune gaye
 
 
 
 
 
 or ab varsh 2015 ke world cap main bhi ireland shandaar khel kaa pradarshan kar rahaa he
 
 
 So far Ireland have played two matches, and managed to win both
 
 
 16 farvari ko ovel main khele gaye match main ireland ne west indies ko chaar wicket se haraaya, or vah bhi 305 ran ke lakshya kaa peechha karte hue
 
 
 Neil o'brien scored an unbeaten 79 from 60 balls, batting brilliantly in this match
 
 
 ireland ne apane duusare match main yuai ko haraaya he
 
 
 Ireland also won this match chasing a target of 279 runs
 
 
 jab ireland 34
 After losing six wickets in 2 overs, he was able to score just 131 runs, and was heading towards an almost certain defeat, with Kevin o'brien once again batting on Ireland to lead Ireland to victory
 
 
 kevin ne teji se khelte hue 25 gendon kaa saamana kar 50 ran banaae, jinamein aath chauke or do chakke shaamil the, or antat ireland ne yah match do wicket se jeet liya
 
 
 So, i want to say it again
 
 
 2015 ke world cap main ireland bahut bada ulatpher kar saktaa he
 
 
 The Ireland team has the strength to reach the semi-finals, and if it wins one or two big matches, it can also reach the final

 Love is a beautiful feeling that can be seen in people of any age
 is ehsaas ko zyaadaatar log mahasoos karnaa chaahate hai
 But it is often seen that in the initial days people get lost in this love relationship in such a way that they do not like any other relationship other than love
 lekin kehete hai naa ki samay ke saath har cheez badal jaati he
 Something similar happens in love relationship also
 kuch samay ke baad rishton kii chamak feeki padane lagati he or logon ke bich pyaar kii jagah tanaav le letaa he
 Due to this tension, sometimes some such reasons arise which break the relationship inside
 to aaie jaane, aisi hi kuch baaten jo ho sakati hai rishte main dhokhaa dene kii vajah
 
 
 1
 kahin wo aapse bor to nahin ho gaye:rishte main jo taazgi or pyaar shuruaati dinon main mahasoos hoti he, kuch saalon baad wo kahin khone lagati he
 By the way, most people adopt many ways to overcome this deficiency, but nowadays people are starting to change their partner and if your partner is also telling boring daily, then understand that he no longer takes this relationship forward Want to go 2
 Ignoring Partner: Most people in love relationship complain to their partner that they are unable to give them time
 aajkal ke lifestil main log itane biji ho gaye hai ki unke paas kisi cheez ke liye samay hi nahi rahata
 Due to lack of time, one feels that his partner is ignoring him
 jis kaaran wo kisi duusare vyakti ke saath rishta bana lete hai jo unka dhyaan rakhata ho
 3
 partner kii uplabdhiyon se jalan:aajkal ke badalte jivan main ladkaa ho yaa ladki, har koi safalataa praapt karnaa chahta he
 This weakens the enthusiasm of people to move ahead of each other
 akasar dekha jaataa he ki rishte main bandhe do logon main jab kisi ek vyakti ko zyada safalataa milti he to duusare partner ko is cheez se kahin naa kahin jalan jarur hoti he or isi jalan ke kaaran log apane partner ko dhokhaa dete hai
 4
 rishte main asuraksha kaa ehsaas:kisi bhi rishte main agar asuraksha kaa ehsaas hone lage to us rishte ko tuutane main zyada samay nahin lagata
 This feeling is most commonly seen among teenagers
 akasar log apane partner kii unke doston ke saath nazdikiyon ko pasand nahin karte
 Heart to heart makes them feel insecure about their partner
 jo rishte main dhokhe kaa ek kaaran banataa he
 5
 aatm sammaan kii kami:kai baar dekha gaya he ki pyaar main ham sab itnaa kho jate hai ki khud ke sammaan ko taak par rakhkar partner kii har baat ko maanane lagate hai
 Love asks for dedication, but it has been seen many times that the person in front of this thing starts taking advantage and somewhere else it causes to cheat
 6
 When the partner stops respecting you: When the relationship starts, it is natural to take care of each other's small and big things
 lekin jab rishta tuutane lagata he to inhen baton kii kami hone lagati he
 When yourpartner starts granting your words and things, then understand that now the respect and love in this relationship is all over
 7
 Fear of losing a partner: It is often seen that at the beginning of a new relationship, a strange kind of fear about the partner resides in the heart, but the same fear can be seen in long-lasting relationships
 ye dar hota he kamitment kaa kai baar log isi dar ke chalate bhi dhokhaa dete hai
 If your partner is avoiding giving you any kind of commitment then it should be understood that the relationship is on the verge of breaking up soon

 Describing Baba Ramdev as a 'criminal type of person', Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh also claimed that yoga gurus could do anything with Balakrishna for fear of being exposed

 Balkrishna is currently under judicial custody in a jail in Uttarakhand in connection with forgery
 congress mahasachiv ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki mujhe is baat kii shankaa he ki ramdev kii puri polpattee unke sahyogi baalkrishna ke paas he
 My request to the government is to protect the life of Balakrishna, because Ramdev is a criminal type
 ramdev apni pole khulne ke dar se baalkrishna ke saath kuch bhi kar sakate hai
 Digvijay said that i am saying with all my understanding and responsibility that Balakrishna's life is in danger
 philhal uttarakhand kii sudhowala jail main nyaayik hiraasat ke tahat band baalkrishna par jaalsaji or bhartiya passport adhinium ke ulanghan ke aarope hai

 digvijay ne daawa kiya ki unhone baalkrishna par nepali naagarik hone or farji degree rakhane ke jo aarope lagaaye the, vah sibiai kii jaanch ke baad sach sabit ho gayi hai
 The Congress General Secretary said on a question that my request to Ramdev is that he should withdraw his agitation in Delhi starting on August 9, because it will not make any difference
 unhone kaha ki videshi bainkon main jamaa kaala dhan waapas laane ke liye bharat sarkaar harsambhav prayaas kar rahi he
 Hence, the issue of black money in the country is no longer special
 digvijay ne haalanki kaha ki agar ramdev ke paas videshi bainkon main jamaa kaale dhan ko bharat waapas laane ke liye kuch ‘naye suzav’ hai, to vah inhen pradhanmantri or vitt mantri tak pahunchaa sakate hai
 Nonetheless, the Congress General Secretary was his archrival
 parichit andaaj main yoga guru par nishaanaa saadhane se nahin chuke
 Digvijay said sarcastically that why Ramdev forgets that black money is also stored in the country and it also needs to be brought back
 yoga guru ko bataanaa chaiye ki unki kharidi kitni jameenon kii registry hui or in saudon main kitne kaale dhan kaa istemaal hua he

 dilli ucch nyaayalay ne kaha he ki kisi pravesh pariksha main rank paane vaale vidhyaarthee agar pravesh ke liye counselling ke samay jaruri dastavej jamaa nahin kar pate to vah daakhila nahin dene par vishvavidhyalay ko jimmedaar nahin tehra sakate
 Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva said, "since the petitioners could not come to the counseling with the original documents as per the notification, the action of the respondent University for not giving admission to them and not considering the degree awarded at a later date should not be misconstrued
" can
 ’’ adaalat ne chaatr bhim shankar thakur kii yachika khaarij karte hue yah tippanee kii
 Thakur had requested that the University of Delhi (DU) be directed to accept his degree and enroll in LLB course in the 2016-17 session
 thakur elelbi pravesh pariksha main shaamil hue the or unhen obisi shrenee main 767 rank praapt hui thi
 According to the rank, he was called for counseling on 22 August but could not submit the original bachelor's degree
 tippaniyan Thakur graduated in 2012 but did not pursue a degree from the university
 vishvavidhyalay ne jab unhen daakhila dene se manaa kiya to unhone aath sitambar, 2016 ko meerut ke apane purv vishvavidhyalay se degree praapt kii
 He did not accept it when he went to Delhi University to submit a degree after the counseling ended
 nyaayamurti sanjeev sachdeva ne kaha, ‘‘chunki yachikakarta adhisuchana ke anusaar mul dastavejon ke saath counselling main nahin aa sake, isliye unhen pravesh nahin dene tathaa baad kii taarikh main di gayi degree par vichaar nahin karne kii prativaadee vishvavidhyalay kii karrwai ko galat nahin bataaya ja saktaa
 The court made this remark while dismissing the petition of student Bhim Shankar Thakur

 isi kadi main bijepi pravaktaa tejinder bagga mashroom kek lekar dilli bijepi karyaalay pahunche or logon kaa munh meetha karaayaa
 The biggest administrative and government jobs in Uttar Pradesh have been rigged
 ajtak ne sting oparation karke us dhaandhlee kaa sach beparda kiya he
 In UP PCS, numbers were also collected in a caste-specific interview and to a large extent in the written examination
 samaajawaadee party main sansad se lekar vidhansabha tak mulaayam singh yadav ke kunbe kaa raaj he
 Mulayam Singh Yadav sits in the Parliament himself, along with daughters-in-law and nephews, and son and brother in the assembly
 upi main sarkaar aisi he ki koi ise baap-bete kii sarkaar kaa naam de rahaa he, to koi bhai-bhattije kii sarkaar kahkar pukaar rahaa he
 The dynasty has also been elected by the vote of the people, so no one can directly accuse Mulayam Singh Yadav
 lekin vot kii raajnneeti se pare uttar pradesh ke lok seva ayog main jab merit list par yadav raaj savaar ho jaae, to iljaam laganaa lajimi he
 Yes, the 'vote bank' of the Samajwadi Party is now doing wonders in the Public Service Commission as well
 ab tak to jati ke vot bank ke naam par saansad or vidhayak ban rahe the, lekin ab upi main esadm or dipti espi bhi vot bank main se nikal rahe hai
 The officers who will later sit on the chair of DM, SP, Commissioner, DIG-IG, will have their specialty and only one particular caste
 chaunkiye mat, ajtak ke paas wo dastavej hai, jo jaahir karte hai ki kis tarah upi main ek khaas jati ke naam par chun-chunakar candidats ko intervyuu board tak pahunchaaya, phir intervyuu main un par jamkar number lutaae gaye
 After all, in the examination and interview of UP PCS, Yadav caste candidates were covered from top to bottom
 ji haa, vikaas dhar or himanshu kumaar gupta ko intervyuu main 102 or 115 number mili, lekin ragesh kumaar yadav puure ke puure 140 lekar aage nikal gaye
 Ankur Singh, Vineet Singh and Abhishek Singh have got more numbers in the written examination, but they were reduced to 113, 115 in the interview, while Surendra Prasad Yadav is far behind in the written examination, but after getting the number 136 in the interview, the final list
 Made a place in amitabh yadav or mayashankar yadav bhi jati ke naam par intervyuu ke number luutane main kaamyaab rahe, jabakigeneral katgari ke baaki ummidavaaron kii yogyata intervyuu main dam tod gai
 The worst case is in the SC or Schedule Cast category, in which 140 candidates, many of them could not even touch the figure of 100
 uttar pradesh main sarkari naukari ke sabase bade imtihaan main kii gai sabase badi dhaandhlee ko aaj aapaki ankhon ke saamne ajtak ujagar kar rahaa he
 In which dark cave is the future of your children in UP
 raat-din mehnat karke aapke bachche intervyuu board tak pahunchate hai, lekin final list aate-aate merit se gaayab ho jate hai
 a ringing of the phone rings from Delhi and Lucknow and comes on the merit list, topping the recommended Conduit Interview
 elahabaad main uttar pradesh lok seva ayog main sorce-sifarish kaa haal yah he ki ayog ke karmchaaree bhi maanane lage hai ki bina sifarish yahaan merit main jagah nahin banati
 There are 200 numbers in the UP PCS interview, but the rule is that if a candidate is awarded more than 140 marks, then the commission has to give a mark
 saal 2011 ke upipisies kaa intervyuu pichley saal hua, usamen yadav ummidavaaron ko sabase zyada ank mili
 Between 138 and 140, while candidates of other castes were left out of good marks in interviews
 aaie ab aapako dikhaate hai upi pisies ke imtihaan kii wo fehrist, jo dhaandhlee kaa khud ek saboot he
 See how the Yadav caste candidates have been numbered 140 and 138, while most non-yadav candidates have been grouped from 100 to 110
 
 
 
 Ragesh Kumar Yadav - 140 Rahul Yadav- 140 Surendra Yadav- 136 Amitabh Yadav- 140 Mayashankar Yadav- 138 Arvind Kumar Yadav- 140 Siddharth Yadav- 138 Dhanvir Yadav- 137 Jyotsna Yadav- 138 Somlata Yadav- 138 Brajesh Yadav- 138 Ravindra Pratap Yadav- 137 Ram Ashok Yadav- 139 Ram Kumar Bahadur- 140 -138 Shiv Kumar Yadav- 139 Anil Kumar Yadav- 139 Neetu Yadav- 138 Ashok Kumar Yadav- 137 Dev Kumar Yadav- 140 Ramesh Chandra Yadav- 140 Supriya Yadav- 139 Vikas Yadav- 139 Sushi Kumar Ginaan name Yadv- 140 Mamata Yadv- 140 some
 
 
 pisies 2011 pariksha kaa intervyuu akhilesh yadav sarkaar ke samay pichley saal hua tha
 The surprising thing is that 86 candidates were selected in the backward class, out of which 50 were Yadavs
 ekaadh ummidavaaron ko chhodkar yadav jati main sabhi ummidavaaron ko 135 se 140 ke bich intervyuu main number mili
 The special thing is that the number of candidates of Yadav caste who were less than other candidates in Mains also got the highest number in the interview
 elahabaad vishvavidhyalay main hindi ke vibhaagadhyaksh mushtak ali lok seva ayog ke imtihaanon main ummidavaaron kaa intervyuu lete rahe hai
 Mushtaq saheb opened the public service commission on the intelligence camera
 inhone khulaasa kiya ki bhale hi sarkaar intervyuu board ko jitna bhi gopneey rakhe, phir bhi kahin naa kahin sifarish apana kaam kar jaati he
 UP PCS Secretary Anil Kumar Yadav has said that the functioning of the Commission is completely transparent
 ummidavaaron ko yogyata ke hisaab se ank mili hai
 It is wrong to see it through the prism of caste or religion
 vaise bhi chayan prakriya main ayog ke adhyaksh yaa sachiv kaa koi dakhal nahin hota
 The interview board does not even know the roll number of the student
 rahi baat scalling kii to uskaa formula supreme court ke nirdesh par bana he
 In this, the points are automatically generated after feeding the data
 is tarah ke aaropon kaa to koi aadhaar hi nahin he
 However, what is the reality of Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission, it is now fully revealed
 goa main aam aadmi party ne mukhyamantri lakshmikant parsekar ko 24 ghante ke bheetar peedbludi mantri sudin dhavlikar kii degree dikhaane kaa dedline diya he
 For this, the Aam Aadmi Party has written a letter to Parsekar
 patr main 'aap' neparsekarko likhaa ki peedbludi mantri sudin dhavlikar ne shapath grahan ke samay daawa kiya tha ki unhone parvatibai chaugule college se 1979-80 main biessi kii thi
 But AAP claims that Dhavalikar has not done any such course
 party nemukhyamantrico likhaa he ki agar mantri ne biessi kii he to 24 ghante ke bheetar public domen main apane certificate prastut karen
 If this does not happen, Dhavalikar will face arrest and action under section 420 of the IPC

 He said that the Chief Minister has made Madhya Pradesh number one in everything, the state is number one in corruption, unemployment and crime

 It is said that Lord Rama performed Shradh for his father Dasharatha in Chitrakoot

 It is believed that the ancestors' powers are vested in the person through Kamadgiri philosophy and circumambulation in Pitrupaksha

 The police have acted in an arbitrary manner by making the son an accused in the case, knowing that he was not present at the scene and that the army personnel were working peacefully while they were trying to save the government property due to the violent mob Legally forced to get it done

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni termed the World Cup Group b match against Holland at Ferozeshah Kotla on Wednesday, saying that the team would like to win the match by a big margin given the tough competition ahead
 dhoni ne match kii purv sandhya par kaha, ‘haa main maanata hum ki yah match aasaan hoga or ham isamen bade antar se jeet darj karnaa chahenge kyonki aage ke sabhi match kaaphi kade honge
 But we do not want to divert our attention by thinking about the matches ahead
 prakriya mahatvapurn he or ham is par dhyaan dete hai
 The Indian captain also hinted that the team will field two fast bowlers and two spinners in this match
 unhone dakshin africa or westeindies ke khilaaf hone vaale aagaamee maichon se pehle gendbaajon ke liye vaapasi karne ke liye lihaaj se is match ko mahatvapurn bataaya
 Dhoni said, "so far the strategy of two fast bowlers and two spinners has worked and we are focusing on that right now
 gendbaaji main dhire-dhire sudhaar ke lakshan dikh rahe hai
 It is important for bowlers how they bring the frozen batsman out under pressure
 ’unhone kaha ki team ke paas abhi tak vikalpon kii kami thi kyonki ashish nehra feet nahin the
 'on fitness i would say that all our players are available for selection
 nehra abhi tak fitness ke liye sangharsh kar rahaa tha jabaki munaf patel pichhali kuch shrinkhalaaon se hi hamaare saath tha lekin mujhe ummid he ki aage gendbaaj behatar pradarshan karenge
 The Indian captain said, "as far as fielding is concerned, i do not think there will be much improvement during the tournament
 yah jaisi he waisi hi rahegi
 Dhoni praised Yuvraj Singh, who took five wickets in the last match against Ireland and also scored a half-century
 unhone kaha, ‘yuvaraj kaa farm main aana hamaare liye bahut acchhee khabar he
 i am a big fan of Yuvi
 vah mushkil paristhitiyon main rakshaatmak ballebaaji karne main sakasham he or apane boote par match kaa rukh palat saktaa he
 His bowling has been very important for us so that we can get down with four bowlers
 ’dhoni ne kaha ki aage ke kade muqablon ko dekhte hue vah chaahate hai ki sabhi khilaadiyon ko lig charan main hi mauka mil jaae lekin jahaan unhone aswin ke antim ekadash main shaamil hone ke sanket diye vahiin saaf kiya ki suresh raina ke liye philhal jagah nahin ban paa rahi he
 He said, 'ashwin is a very good bowler and he has done well in some matches for us
 vah kab antim ekadash kaa hissaa banegaa is par jarurat or samay ke hisaab se faisla kiya jayega
 The Indian captain also ruled out the possibility of sending Yusuf Pathan up the order as Virat Kohli is doing better at number three and four
 unhone kaha, ‘viraat tisare yaa chauthe number par acha pradarshan kar rahaa he
 I, Yusuf and Yuvraj can also play at these places but we have to decide according to the circumstances and by looking at the attack of the opposing team
 viraat upari kram main apni puri kshamta se kheltaa he or uske sthaan main badlaav karnaa sahi nahin hoga
 Dhoni also expressed satisfaction on the wickets so far in the tournament
 unhone kaha, ‘ab tak jo bhi wicket hamen mili hai ve achche the or main unase khush hum
 We have had a good start but it is important to achieve our best form at the right time
 hamaare liye nokout main apni acchhee form ke saath utarana hoga
 When Dhoni was asked if he had any difficulty in making decisions as captain, he said, "the captain has to consider everything
" kai baar gendbaaj ke liye to kabhi ballebaaj ke liye bhi ranneeti banani hoti he
 Depending on the circumstances, the batsmen also have to change
 koi bhi captain jarurat ke hisaab se hi faisle karata he
 ' dakshin africa kii pes bydaree ke khilaaf viraat kohli ne jis tarah kii ballebaaji kii use dekhakar ab lag rahaa he ki bharat pehle test match main van de siries kii haar kaa badla chukaa saktaa he
 Playing at number four, Virat hit a century and reminded him of master blaster Sachin Tendulkar
 unke bade score se bharat ek sammanjanak sthiti main khadaa he or agar captain dhoni apane anya saathiyon ke saath milakar kul score 400 se upar le jate hai to bharat dakshin africa team ko ghutane techne ke liye majaboor kar saktaa he
 In the position on which Virat Kohli was playing, apart from caution, the attack was needed because the player who plays there has to save his wicket, also have to score runs fast
 lekin viraat ne safalataa se yah kathin kaam puraa kiya
 He also handled wickets and got runs
 sabase badi baat yah he ki unhone khel ko dhimaa nahin hone diya
 This put pressure on the bowlers of South Africa
 unhone chah gendbaajon kaa istemaal kiya lekin ran gati ko nahin roak paae
 Now captain Dhoni has Rahane and Ashwin with whom if they take the score beyond 400 then it will be a great opportunity for our bowlers to settle the score
 bhartiya tej gendbaaj van de kii apeksha yahaan acha kar sakenge
 Former captain Sourav Ganguly has expressed a lot of confidence in emerging bowler Muhammad Shami in the conversation till date
 unhone do took kaha ki shami is samay sabase achche gendbaaj hai or ve dakshin africa kii pichon kaa khub phayda uthaa sakate hai
 He has pace, swing and above all makes sense
 unhone van de main bhi dakshin africa gendbaajon ko khub pareshaan kiya tha or vicketen bhi lee thim
 On the other hand, Zaheer Khan's return to the team has filled the lack of an experienced bowler
 vah vahaan khel chuke hai or ballebaajon kii kamajoriyon ko samajhate hai
 If they leave, they will have to pay for taking South Africa
 van de main beshak dakshin africa ke ballebaaj bada score karte rahe hon lekin test main dhunandhar ballebaaji ke liye bahut zyada jagah nahin hoti
 Their successful batsmen will also be tested this time
 dhyaan rahe ki jahir khan captain greem smith ke sabase bade dushman hai or unhen chalane nahin dete
 He has dismissed him 13 times before this
 agar is baar bhi aisa kuch hota he to dakshin africa ke liye bahut bada score khadaa karnaa mushkil hoga
 Indian spinners did not play in One Day
 aswin ko sirf ek wicket mila tha lekin agar bharat bada score khadaa karata he to unhen gendbaaji ke liye kaaphi jagah mil paaegi or vah kai tarah ke prayog kar sakenge
 He has learned a lot from One Day and it will be easy for him to turn the ball when the fast bowler has thrown the ball for one and a half days on the pitch
 tej pich par kai baar spinner acha pradarshan kar jate hai
 The match is no longer one-sided and Virat Kohli has raised hopes for India
 dekhnaa he ki dhoni or rahane ise kitna aage tak khinch kar le jate hai
 Outside a police station in West Bengal's Virbhum district, a group of people allegedly attacked a police officer and forcibly freed a Trinamool worker, who later surrendered to the police
 police ne bataaya ki mahilaon sahit logon ke ek bade samooh ne police thana or thana prabharee abul ali par bhi hamalaa kiya aurayaanch kaaryakartakhilafat ali ko vahaan se baahar nikaal le gaye
 In an earlier case, the police arrested him just hours before
 haalanki baad main usne sarender kar diya
 Police said that action will be taken against him as per law
 baharhaal, beeti raat police thana par kiye gaye hamale ke silsile main kisi ko giraftaar nahin kiya gaya he
 input language pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kaha ki naksalwad kii chunauti se nipatane ke liye or bahut kuch karne kii jarurat he
 He said that we realize that the Naxalites are our own people and we are ready to talk to them provided they leave the path of violence first
 unhone jammu kashmir main aatankwaadi gatividhiyon par kaha ki jammu-kashmir main aatankwaadi gatividhiyon main kami ke baavjood pradesh main kanoon vyavastha kaa maamla gambhir chintaa kaa vishay bana hua he
 The Prime Minister said that there is a need to pay attention to the standard operating procedure and measures to deal effectively with the crowding crowd without adopting any lethal approach
 manmohan singh ne kaha ki desh main anushaasit karne kii prakriya pichley kuch vashren main kaaphi jatil ho gai he
 He said that the increasing presence of radical groups, left-wing extremists and terrorist elements has further complicated the matter in recent years
 unhone jor dekar kaha ki maanak sanchaalan prakriya or pradarshan kar rahi bheed se koi ghaatak tarika apanaae bina prabhavi tareeke se nipatane ke upayon par dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi interacted with fishermen at the Fishermen's Parliament program in Thrissur, Kerala
 is dauraan unhone piem narendra modi par hamalaa bolte hue vaada kiya ki agar congress sarkaar satta main ai to alag se matsay paalan or machuaaraa kalyaan ke liye ek alag mantralay banaaya jayega

 co / 4dqv9vq92d Sandeep Kumar, former minister of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal government and sitting MLA from Sultanpur, has targeted his own government
 sandip kumaar ne aarope lagaaya he ki unki sarkaar main jal board vibhaag is vaqt jabardast bhrashtachar chal rahaa he
 According to Sandeep Kumar, in the past, there has been a lot of corruption in the tender process of 200 machines for automatic sewer cleaning
 jal board main siver kii maikenical clining ke liye siver safai karmi or unke parivaar ke logon ko 200 mashine di jaani thi
 Sandeep Kumar has alleged irregularities in the tendering process of Jalboard
 kejariwal kaa ghulaam nahin: sandipam aadmi party ke vidhayak sandip kumaar ne dilli ke press club main press conference karke jal board par gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 When Sandeep Kumar was asked whether the press conference and party chief Arvind Kejriwal might be angry, Sandeep retorted that he was not a slave to Kejriwal and did not think he needed to ask anyone to talk about his society
 Huh
 AAP ne daliton ko thaga: sandipasandip kumaar ne aam aadmi party samet sabhi dalon par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki partiyon ne daliton ko thaga he, jab unase poocha gaya ki aam aadmi party kii sarkaar main unhen bhi mantri banaaya gaya tha, to unhone kaha ki ye mahaz dikhaane ke liye kiya gaya tha or aam aadmi party bhi duusare sabhi dalon kii tarah daliton ko keval vot bank ke taur par istemaal karti he
 In the Delhi assembly session, when AAP MLA Sandeep Kumar wanted the Jal Board to raise the issue of corruption, he was expelled from the House through marshals for violating the proceedings of the Assembly
 yah daawa sandip kumaar ne ek baar phir se press conference main kiya
 Sandeep said that if the party does not listen to him in the coming days, then he can be forced to take the road with his society against his party

 a chance to see Salman Khan once again in the role of 'prem', i have loved 'hum Aapke Hain Kaun' and 'hum Saath Saath Hain' as a sensible and sensitive family man along with the Musselman Khanlwar Boy Were shown
 lekin unke kirdaar main ek bachapanaa bhi rahaa
 It remains to be seen what changes have been made in the personality of 'prem' through 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo'
 2
 salman-sonam duo Salman Khan has also previously shared screen with Sonam Kapoor in 'saawariya' but that role was quite small
 leading role main ye donon kalakaar pehali baar ek duusare ke aamane saamne hai
 Seeing the trailer and songs of 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo', it really seems that this pair will probably prove to be one of the best onscreen couples in Bollywood
 3
 Alishan Setsuraj Barjatya has always been popular in his films for showcasing Alishan Havelian, great chandeliers, royal costumes and fine jewelery
 aise main jab 'prem ratan dhan payo' main salmaan kaa kirdaar hi ek prince kaa he, to roylty kis level kii hogi iskaa andaja aap laga hi sakate hai

 pakistani senake ek sevanivrutt general ne daawa kiya he ki parvej musharraf nekargilke bhartiya kshetra main daakhil apane sainikon ko die gaye adeshon ke bare main iesai ko bhi bhanak nahin lagane di thi or is khufia agency ko bharat kii sena ke sanchaar ko intercept karke isaki jaankaree mili
 Lieutenant General (retd) Shahid Aziz says that he conveyed the stir in Kargil on 3–4 May 1999 to the then ISI Chief Lt Gen Ziauddin Batt through the intercept
 iske baad batt ne ajij ne kaha ki vah isse jude dastavej ko apane paas rakhen
 According to Aziz, it was found through the intercept that 10 Corps soldiers were carrying out 'offensive operations' across the Line of Control
 kargil ke samay ajij iesai kii vishleshan shakha ke pramukh the
 In the book 'ye Khamoshi Kaun Tak' written in Urdu, Aziz has said that the script of the entire campaign of Kargil was written and executed by the then army chief Musharraf himself
 musharraf ke alaava teen or log bharat ke khilaaf is sajeesh main shaamil the
 The three Chiefs of the General Staff were Lieutenant General Aziz Muhammad Khan, 10 Corps Chiefs Lieutenant General Mahmood Ahmed, and Major General Javed Hassan, the Chief of the Force Command Northern Area (FCNA)
 ajij kehete hai, ‘in chaar general ke alaava koi bhi sheersh sainya adhikari is abhiyaan ke bare main nahin jaanata tha
 Even the employees of 10 Corps Headquarters had no idea what was happening in Kargil
 sainya abhiyaan nideshaalay ko bhi us vakt pataa chalaa jab sab kuch ho chukaa tha
 Butt, the then ISI chief, later admitted that Pakistani troops had occupied areas of India that were lying vacant or that the Indian troops had left during the winter
 ajij kaa kahana he, ‘intercept ke jariye pataa chalaa ki bhartiya paksh main kis tarah kii niraashaa he or ve asamanjas kii sthiti main baat kar rahe hai
 It seemed that our army had launched a major campaign in Kargil
 ’ may, 1999 main pakistan ke sainya abhiyaan nideshaalay main major general tawqir jiya ne kaha ki nardan lite infentary or kuch duusari ikaayiyon ke sainikon ne kargil main khaali pade kshetron par kabja kar liya he
 Aziz said that he made revelations in his book about Kargil to correct some of the things that Musharraf mentioned in his book 'the Line of Fire'
 ajij ne kaha, ‘meraa maananaa he ki sachai ko saamne nahin laayaa gaya to naujavaanon kaa khun jaaya chalaa jayega
 i do not want the soldiers to be blinded and thrown into the fire
 ’ is purv adhikari ne kaha ki pakistan ne 1971 main bharat ke saath yuddh ke tathyon ko chipaaya or ab kargil ko lekar bhi vahi ho rahaa he
 Aziz also mentions why Musharraf kept the Kargil campaign a secret
 vah likhte hai, ‘ise gopneey rakhane kii koi vajah nahin rah jaati
 From a military point of view, the plan was very weak and preparations were limited and at that time there was no time to talk about it
 ise saarvajanik karne par log sweekaar bhi nahin karte
 Perhaps this was the reason why no one was informed
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘sawaal yah he ki yah abhiyaan kyon chalaaya gaya? iskaa kya makasad tha? kya yah ek bhul thi? is raaj kaa khulaasa shaayad kabhi nahin hoga

 A
 Raja said that a person stays 12 years in his knowledge in a person's house, pays taxes as well as completes other procedures of the government, then that property becomes his
 yah kanoon kahata he
 He said that there has been a mosque there for 400 years
 ram kaa janm teen lakh saal pehle hua tha or iskaa koi saboot bhi nahin he
 In such a case, the verdict should come in favor of Babri Masjid
 haalanki raja ne saath hi kaha ki hamane kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki anuchhed 370 main badlaav hoga, lekin usamen badlaav ho gaya
 What will happen in the Babri Masjid case is not known yet

 The protesters were shouting slogans like 'we Want Justice' and 'halla Bol'

 The three-hour-long demonstration was peaceful
 lokmaanya bal gangadhar tilak kii aawaaj kaa ek durlabh audio mila he, jo 97 saal pehle kaa he
 Deepak Tilak, the great-grandson of this great leader who once shook the British with his voice, said that the library of Kesari Trust has kept a wide collection of Lokmanya's articles and books for years, but the audio of his voice was not available

 If the cleanliness campaign was carried out in the country, Gandhi was useful

 Needless to say that Gandhi has become such a brand in this country from which neither can be rid of nor can be adopted completely

 Where are the values of Gandhi today in truth, non-violence, asthey, aparigraha, restraint, ethics? They are increasingly made irrelevant superpowers whose political relevance is a compulsion to prove to the political as well as to the ruling party

 There are letters and magazines in Gandhi's praise

 Despite this nationwide reverence for Gandhi, neither is anyone in favor of a lifestyle like Gandhi nor does he agree to walk on the path of truth, non-violence and non-grace, in the name of Gandhi, we made the Mahatma Gandhi path and forgot to follow him on our own went
 ve keval maarg yaa path ban kar rah gaye
 In Gandhi's country, straightforward humans like Gandhi went missing and many were dominating on the surface
 gram swaraj ke naam par gaanvon ko raajnneeti kaa akhaada bana diya gaya, to chunaav ko loktantr kaa prahasan
 In such a situation, what does Gandhi mean to a poet, where and why did Gandhi's path get lost? Poet lyricist Dr Om Nischal has beautifully crafted it in his song
 padhie sahitya aaj tak ke liye khaastaur se likhaa gaya dow om nishchal kaa yah geet:kahaan kho gaya gandhi-path ?ham bharat ke adhivasihain vibhinn bhashabhashiham astey, ahimsa kishuchitaon ke abhyasipar ham bilkul badal gadhpana lee hamane har lat
 Where was the lost Gandhi-path? In the way of living, they were the top of the general idea
 We were the support of the culture of Vedas and Puranas
 We were disgusted with the descent of sages and sages
 kahaan kho gaya gandhi-path ?hamamen bhai-chaara thasanth-samagam nyaara thaham kudarat ke nikat raheham par sankat vikat rahob sambandh sage sarehue khun se jyon lathpath
 Where was the lost Gandhi-path? We were the companions of nature, we were all believers, we had no distinction; The people of Gurukul were lost in the clogged mines, where were the lost Gandhi-paths? We as humans have lost so much lost business politics
 Which we would have done more, lost the Gandhi-path? Gandhi had also filled his life with papad, but the cream was being cut
 His followers - Chelebelgam is now running The Life Chariot of Prapancha
 kahaan kho gaya gandhi-path ?pita sareekhe the parvatama-si thim sari nadiyaan'vasudha hi kutumb' kehtebit gayin kitni sadiyanashray khoj rahaa becharalokatantr main ram bhagat
 Where is the lost gandhi-path? More people resembling Gandhi have got footage here, only the brand image of Loktantra is seen in the place, the bus-name plaque gandhi-path
 kahaan kho gaya gandhi-path ? LG Tejendra Khanna's address in the first final budget session of the elections gave a glimpse of the preparatory preparations of Shila Dixit Sarkar
 vipaksh kii tokaatoki ke bich alji nesarkaar kii uplabdhiyon kaa bakhaankia
 But those issues have not been touched by which the people of Delhi want to get rid of them
 abhibhaashan main na tovasant vihaar gangarepaka zikr tha, nanursry admishnaki pareshaani kaa or na hi bijli kii badi daron kaa
 The question is also that when the government is in profit then why is the public in deficit
 dilli ab world class city
 Delhi has the lowest inflation rate
 895 aniyamit coloniyaan niyamit huin
 Financial assistance to 8 lakh students
 sadakon par kharch honge 15 sau karod
 These are some of the achievements that LG made at the beginning of the budget session
 alji ne kaha ki sarkaar ne pichley 15 saalon main dilli kii tasviir badal di he
 Delhi has not only become an international city but there has also been a tremendous improvement in basic facilities
 mahamahim uparajyapal kaa kahana he ki sarkaar agle saal sadakon par 15 sau karod kharch karne ja rahi he
 Apart from this, 625 new low floor buses are also being purchased
 alji ke abhibhaashan ke baad khud mukhyamantri ne apni sarkaar kii upabaldhiyon ko ginane main kasar nahin chodi
 He even went as far as to say that have you ever seen such a Delhi before
 ab sawaal ye he ki jab dilli sarkaar ne bijli ke nijeekaran se 30 hajaar karod bachaae hai to phir aam aadmi ko iskaa kya laabh mila
 The opposition questioned the entire address
 jaahir he alji ke abhibhaashan ne sarkaar ke chunavi taiyaariyon kii jhalak de di, haalanki sawaal ye he ki jab sarkaar phaayde main he jo phir janata ghate main kyon he

 These strategists also decide that the leader has a profile on social sites
 us profile par kya jayega yah bhi yahi exparts tay karte hai
 If needed, these people create confusion through social sites by buying from followers to likes or they say that they work towards turning the party
 or aaj ke takanic ke yug main philhal aise log kaamyaab bhi ho rahe hai
 The most talked about electoral strategist in the country these days is Prashant Kishore
 kaha jaataa he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ko itani oochaainyon tak pahunchane main unhone kaaphi yogadan diya
 After this he became angry with anything and before the Bihar elections, Kishore caught Nitish Kumar and made a strategy for JDU
 bihar main jediu ne bijepi ne pehle hi naata tod liya tha or phir unhone lalu prasad yadav kii argedy se gathbandhan karaayaa
 There is no doubt that despite the Narendra Modi wave, the BJP lost badly in Bihar and the JDU-RJD alliance returned to power
 vaise chunaavon se pehle aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat kaa aarakshan par diya bayaan bhi is karaari haar kaa kaaran bana tha
 After keeping the BJP away from power in Bihar, the Congress Party approached Prashant Kishore for services and joined the Prashant Kishore Jijan to bring the Congress Party which was almost marginalized in Uttar Pradesh
 isliye congress party ke saath-saath is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav chunavi ranneetikaron ke liye bhi ek imtihaan se kam nahin he
 It is said that at the behest of Prashant Kishore, Rahul Gandhi had earlier been talking about contesting elections on his own in Uttar Pradesh
 yahaan tak kii gathbandhan kii kisi sambhaavna se vah inkaar kar rahe the
 By the time, Rahul Gandhi started working on the strategy of Ekla Chalo for the party since he started working alone in active politics
 unka maananaa tha ki gathbandhan ke sahare party ko majboot nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 This is the reason why in the general elections of 2009 Lalu Prasad Yadav's famous decision not to tie up with RJD was also taken by Rahul
 uttarapradesh ke 2017 ke chunavi mahaasangram main bhi pehle vah congress ke akele ladane kii baat kah rahe the
 In this direction, a month-long campaign of Kisan Yatra and Khat Sabha was also carried out
 mana jaataa he ki kisaan yatra or khaat sabha kaa upaay bhi janaadhar badhaane ke liye prashanth kishor ne hi diya tha
 According to some reports, even standing alone to strengthen the party was seen as Prashant Kishore's strategy
 magar uttarapradesh main is chunaav ke liye party ke mukhya ranneetikaar prashanth kishor ne khaat sabhaaon, lakhanu main rahul ke kaarykram or varanasi main sonia gandhi ke road sho ke baad congress haikaman ko gathbandhan ke bina party kii haalat nahin sudharne kii hakeekat bhi bataa di
 It is said that Rahul Gandhi was still not ready for the alliance
 kintu, gulam nabi aaazaad or prashanth kishor ne priyanka gandhi ke jariye rahul gandhi ko iske liye taiyaar kiya
 Even Prashant Kishore knows that the success so far will be washed away by a defeat and the message will go that in politics speaks only and only, speaks the image of the party, speaks the conduct of the leaders, the strategy is much later Is the thing
 isi ke saath congress party ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne bhi yah kabool kar liya he ki gathbandhan kii raajnneeti hi congress kii siyaasi takadir badalane kaa rasta he
 The realization of this reality is that Rahul too has finally had to return to the visible path of Sonia Gandhi's alliance 14 years ago
 sonia ne tab party ko sankat ke daur se nikaalane ke liye ‘shimla sankalp’ main pehali baar gathbandhan kii raajnneeti kii khulkar vakaalat kii thi
 In 2003, Sonia Gandhi announced that for the first time at the Shimla camp, the Congress was also ready for coalition politics to take the party out of the crisis
 tab loksabhaa main congress ke 114 saansad the jo us vakt uski sabase kam sankhya thi
 But Sonia's decision to follow the coalition's path in the 2004 general election managed to change the party's fortunes
 vamadalon ke bahari samarthan se congress na keval kendra kii satta main lauti balki das saal tak kabiz rahi
 However, even after two and a half decades in its old traditional states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the Congress could not rise above the number four party
 tippaniyan The result of Bihar is in front of Rahul Gandhi when he got a good result in the seats in Bihar due to the alliance
 vaise is baar akhilesh yadav ne bhi yah maan liya he ki is prakaar kii ranneeti party kii jeet main sahaayak hoti he
 a team of many experts in Lucknow is engaged in this task
 pichley chunaav main basapa ke soshal ejineering ke liye satish mishra jaise ranneetikaron ko chunavi samar kaa yoddha mana gaya tha
 But in the 2012 assembly elections, the whole strategy was lost
 is baar congress or samaajawaadee party ke ranneetikaron kii samaj kitna kaam aati he yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga
 And in today's era of technology, such people are also succeeding
 desh main aajkal sabase zyada agar kisi chunavi ranneetikaar kii charchaa ho rahi he to vah hai prashanth kishor
 He is said to have contributed a lot to reach Prime Minister Narendra Modi to such heights
 iske baad vah kisi baat se naaraaz ho gaye or fidd bihar ke chunaavon se pehle kishor ne nitish kumaar kaa daaman pakadaa or jediu ke liye ranneeti banaai
 In Bihar, JDU had already broken ties with BJP and then formed an alliance with Lalu Prasad Yadav's RJD
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki narendra modi kii lahar ke baavjood bijepi bihar main buree tarah haar gai or jediu-argedy kaa gathbandhan satta main lautaa
 However, before the elections, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's statement on reservation also caused this drastic defeat
 bihar main bijepi ko satta se dur rakhane ke baad congress party ne prashanth kishor kii sevaaon ke liye sampark kiya or uttar pradesh main lagbhag haashie par pahunch gai congress party ko satta main laane ke liye prashanth kishor jijaan se lag gaye
 Therefore, for the Congress party as well as for the electoral strategists this time the assembly elections are nothing less than a test
 kaha jaataa he ki prashanth kishor ke kehane par hi rahul gandhi pehle uttar pradesh main akele dam par chunaav ladane kii baat karte aa rahe the
 He even denied any possibility of an alliance
 vaise rahul gandhi ne jab se sakriy raajnneeti main akele aage badhane kaa kaam shuru kiya tab se vah party ke liye bhi ekala chalo kii ranneeti par kaam karne lage the
 He believed that the party could not be strengthened by alliance
 yahi vajah rahi ki 2009 ke aam chunaav main lalu prasad yadav kii argedy se gathbandhan nahin karne kaa charchit faisla bhi rahul ne hi liya tha
 He was also talking about the Congress fighting alone in Uttar Pradesh's 2017 General Assembly
 is disha main kisaan yatra or khaat sabha kaa ek maheene kaa bada abhiyaan bhi chalaaya
 It is believed that Prashant Kishore also gave the remedy of Kisan Yatra and Khat Sabha
 kuch reporton ke anusaar yahaan tak kii party ke majboot karne ke liye akele chalane ke stand ko bhi prashanth kishor kii ranneeti ke taur par dekha gaya
 But for this election in Uttar Pradesh, the Chief Strategist of the party, Prashant Kishore, also told the Congress High Command not to improve the condition of the party without an alliance after the Khat meetings, Rahul's program in Lucknow and Sonia Gandhi's roadshow in Varanasi
 kaha jaataa he ki rahul gandhi phir bhi gathbandhan ke liye taiyaar nahin the
 But, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Prashant Kishore prepared Rahul Gandhi for this through Priyanka Gandhi
 yah to prashanth kishor bhi jaanate hai ki jo kamyaabi abhi tak mili vah ek haar se dhul jaaegi or yah sandesh chalaa jayega ki raajnneeti main sirf or sirf kaam bolta he, party kii chhavi bolti he, netaaon kaa aacharan bolta he, ranneeti kaaphi baad kii cheez he
 With this, Congress Party Vice President Rahul Gandhi has also confessed that coalition politics is the way to change the political fortunes of the Congress
 is hakeekat ke ahsaas kaa hi nateeja he ki rahul ko bhi aakhirkaar 14 saal pehle sonia gandhi kii gathbandhan kii dikhaai raah par lautnaa padaa he
 Sonia had then openly advocated coalition politics for the first time in the 'shimla Resolution' to rid the party of crisis
 2003 main sonia gandhi ne party ko sankat ke daur se nikaalane ke liye shimla shivi main pehali baar rashtriya str par congress ke bhi gathbandhan kii raajnneeti ke liye taiyaar hone kii ghoshnaa kii
 At that time, the Congress had 114 mps in the Lok Sabha, which was its lowest number at that time
 magar 2004 ke aam chunaav main gathbandhan kii raah par chalane kaa sonia kaa faisla party kii kismat badalane main kaamyaab rahaa
 With the outside support of the Left parties, the Congress not only returned to power at the Center but also held office for ten years
 haalanki congress tab bhi uttarapradesh or bihar jaise apane puraane paramparaagat pradeshon main dhai dashak baad bhi chauthe number kii party se upar nahin aa saki
 The comments bihar kaa parinaam rahul gandhi ke saamne hai jab unhone gathbandhan ke chalate bihar main siton ke maamle main acha parinaam paaya
 However, this time Akhilesh Yadav has also accepted that this type of strategy helps in the victory of the party
 lakhanu main kai exparts kii team unke is kaary main lagi hui he
 In the last election, strategists such as Satish Mishra for bsp's social engineering were considered as the warriors of the election summer
 lekin 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main sari ranneeti dhari kii dhari rah gai thi
 This time it will be interesting to see how useful the understanding of Congress and Samajwadi Party strategists is
 bihar main bijepi ko satta se dur rakhane ke baad congress party ne prashanth kishor kii sevaaon ke liye sampark kiya or uttar pradesh main lagbhag haashie par pahunch gai congress party ko satta main laane ke liye prashanth kishor jijaan se lag gaye

 ahmedabad ke iti profeshnal vinay patel or devang shah in garmi kii chhuttiyon main nepal jane kii yojana bana rahe the, lekin vahaan aaye bhucamp se puri yojana khatm ho gai he
 This is not the first time that his plan has been destroyed
 diwali kii chhuttiyon main unhone kashmir jane kii yojana banaai thi, lekin vahaan baadh aa jane se us yojana par pani phir gaya tha
 Nepal booking was done with the same cancellation money, or rather the tour operator changed the same booking to Nepal booking, but now it was not possible to go to Nepal
 gujarati samudaay apane pravaas prem ke liye jane jate hai
 Especially during the summer holidays, Gujaratis generally visit the Himalayas or, say, mountains and Nepal in large numbers
 lekin is saal nepal main bhucamp kii vajah se vahaan kii yojanayen thapp ho rahi hai
 On one hand, new bookings are not happening and due to the natural disaster, a large number of cancellations have broken the back of Gujarat's tourism business
 tippaniyan Manish Sharma, chief executive officer of Akshar Travels, says that it was only from him that he had about 10,000 people booking for summer vacation in North India, half of which has been canceled
 ab zyada tavajjo dakshin bharat kii yatra par hi ho rahaa he
 And it will take months for the Gujarat Tourism business to recover from this loss
 itnaa kam he ki kailash maansarovar kii yatra bhi sankaton main ghiri he
 Due to technical reasons, the first batch on April 28 has already been canceled and other consignments in May and June have also been questioned
 usee cancelation ke paise se nepal booking karavaaya gaya tha yaa yun kahen ki tour oparator ne usee booking ko nepal booking main badal diya tha, lekin ab inkaa nepal janaa sambhav nahin ho paaya
 Gujarati communities are known for their love of migration
 khaskar ke garmi kii chhuttiiyon main aam taur par gujarati log himalay yaa kahen ki pahaado or nepal jaisi jagahon par badi sankhya main jate hai
 But this year, due to the earthquake in Nepal, there plans are being stalled
 ek taraf nai booking nahin ho rahi he or kudarti aapadaa kii vajah se badi sankhya main kencelation ne gujarat ke tourism vyavsaay kii qamar hi tod di he
 The comments akshar travels ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari manish sharma kaa kahana he ki sirf unke yahaan se hi garmi kii chhuttiyon kaa uttar bharat ke liye kareeb 10,000 logon kaa booking thi jisamen se aadhi kencil ho chuki he
 Now more attention is being paid to South India
 or is nuksaan se ubarne main gujarat kii tourism vyavsaay ko maheenon lag jaaenge
 It is so low that the journey of Kailash Mansarovar is also in trouble
 takneekee kaarnon se 28 april ko janevaali pehali khep pehle hi radd ho chuki he or may or june main honevaali anya khepon par bhi sawalia nishaan lag gaya he
