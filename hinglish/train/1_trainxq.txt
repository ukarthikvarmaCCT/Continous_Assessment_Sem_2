 Film Name: MS Dhoni: The Untold Story Director: Neeraj Pandestar Cast: Sushant Singh Rajput, Anupam Kher, Kiara Advani, Disha Patani, Rajesh Sharma, Bhumika Chawla Duration: 3 hours 10 minutes Certificates: u Rating: 3
 5 star'baby', 'special chhbbees', 'a vednesade' jaisi saraahneey filmein dene vaale diarector niraj pandey abaki baar vishwa ke mahaan cricket captain mahendra singh dhoni kii jindagi par aadhaarit film lekar aae hai
 Sushant Singh Rajput is together
 ab sawaal ye he ki kya akshay kumaar ke bagaiyr bhi niraj umdaa film bana sakate hai?maahi kii shuruyaat kii kahanefilmaki kahani ranchi shahar se shuru hoti he jahaan paan singh dhoni (anupam kher) ke ghar maahi urf maahi(mahendra singh dhoni)kaa janm hota he
 The child is fond of cricket and it is the desire of the people that Mahi should get a government job in the railway
 vahi aapke or hamaare ghar ke halaat, jisase film realistic lagati he
 But an offer changes the direction of Mahi and this film
 ranchi se maahi kaa dilli tak kaa safar, uske baad maahi kii life main garlfriend (disha pataani) kii entry or khub saare twist dilachasp andaaj main piroe gaye hai
 The film depicts Mahi's career and ends it with Sakshi (kiara Advani) from her wedding to the sequence of winning the 2011 World Cup
 5 points jo film ke saath aap sochenge :1
 You will be aware of Dhoni's cricket life, but how will a cricketer's life fluctuate outside the ground, you will find out by watching the film
 yah ek aisi kahani he jisase kisi bhi varg ke log khud ko conect kar paaenge
 However, the director has presented these incidents behind Dhoni's name growing up very lightly
 dhoni yuvaraj kii pehali mulaakaat, team sellection jaisi kai chizon ko film ne alag pahalu se dikhaaya he
 2
 niraj pandey kii filmonmen anupam kher jarur najar aate hai, jinhone is baar bhi acha role kiya he
 Along with it, Sushant Singh Rajput's hard work is reflected on the screen
 'kaai po che' ke baad ek baar phir vah cricket ke saath sahaj rahe hai
 The presence of Disha Patani, Kiara Advani, Rajesh Sharma, Kumud Mishra, Bhumika Chawla shows that the casting of the film is correct and Neeraj has done a lot of work on them as usual
 3 
 The film dominates romance rather than cricket
 sakshi se pehle dhoni kii jindagi main priyanka kii jagah thi, ise dikhaane main nirdeshak ne koi bhi kami nahin chodi he, aksar kai byopix main dekha jaataa he kii bahut sari personal baton ko puri tarah se nahin dikhaaya jaataa he, lekin is film main aisa nahin he, dhoni kii personal life ke bahut se pahaluon ko baariki se dikhaaya gaya he
 Some revelations have also been made about the selection board of the cricket board and some controvertical news such as the dhoni-viru controversy
 4
 Cinematography, locales keep you engaged with the story and the camera work is also excellent, which does not let your attention get away from the visual
 saath hi jis tarah se graphics ke madhyam se har baar dhoni ke chehre par sushant kaa cheharaa feet kiya gaya he, wo kaaphi natural lagata he
 5
 relies se pehle hi film kaa mujeec darshakon kaa dhyaan aakarshith karne main kaamyaab rahaa he or film dekhne ke baad yah kaha ja saktaa he ki mujeec film kii kahani ko puri tarah se saport karata he
 Especially the song 'besbriyan' whose feel you can feel during the entire film
 lambaai kar sakati he bor
 
 
 The weak link of the film is its length, sometimes the length of the songs is also tight, which if edited would make the film crisp
 teen ghante or das minute kii film ke liye haul main baithna bhi thodaa pareshaan karata he
 At the box office, the film is going to be released by Fox Star Studios in about 4500 screens, in addition to Hindi, the makers are also releasing it in Tamil, Marathi and Telugu languages, due to which, according to trade pundits, the film is bumper
 No one can stop taking openings and a strong weekend collection can happen
 ab dekhte hai ki field ke ye tej-tarraar star box aphis kaa 100 karod kaa 'masterstroke' laga pate hai yaa nahin

 puunji bazaar niamak dhansampatti prabandhak companiyon or visheshtaur par inke sampark prabandhakon par niyaman shikanja kasne kii prakriya main he
 Sebi's view has come to light in view of the recent Rs 350 crore scam conducted by its liaison officer at the Gurgaon branch of Citibank
 isamen bank ke sampark adhikari ne nivesh yojanaon main dhani niveshkon ko lubhaane ke liye jaali dastavej kaa istemaal kiya or badi machhliyon ko apane jaal main fans liya
 In order to protect the interests of investors in this complex area of financial products, SEBI believes that there should be better coordination between different regulators not only at the operational level but also at the level of monitoring and serious efforts should be made for this
 sebi ke nivesh prabandhan vibhaag ke pramukh kaaryakari nideshak keen vidyanathan ne ek sangoshtee main is maamle main kadaa rukh apanaate huye kaha ham chupchaap nahin rah sakate, hamen ek saath aage aane kii zarurat he or yah dekhnaa hoga ki is sampatti prabandhan kshetra kaa kaise behatar niyaman ho saktaa he
 The spread of this area is in different jurisdictions
 vidyanathan nivesh prabandhan vibhaag kaa pramukh hone ke naate videshi sansthagat niveshkon or muchuval fund ke kaamkaaj ko bhi dekhte hai
 He said that this market has now advanced a lot
 sampatti prabandhan kaa yah kshetra banking se lekar puunji bazaar or beemaa niyamaakon ke kshetra tak fail chukaa he
 We now need to unite at the level of regulators as well
 keval nitigat str par hi nahin balki sanchaalan or nigaraanee ke maamle main bhi milakar kaam karne kii zarurat he
 Vaidyanathan said that the liaison manager is a big risk in the asset management business in terms of investors, because the earnings of this officer engaged in liaison management is not directly related to the interest of the investors
 is maamle main jokhim cover ke liye niamakon ko aage aana hoga
 Trishekesh Parandekar, CEO of Karvy Private Wealth Management, said that such steps taken at the level of regulators will definitely benefit the industry and will not stain the name of the industry further
 haalanki, unhone yah bhi kaha ki karvi main sampark adhikari or sampatti prabadhankon ke liye jaanch parakh kii kai charnon kii prakriya he phir bhi yadi koi aparaadh karne par uthaaru hi ho jaye to dharti par koi use nahin roak saktaa he

 IANS se input Hrithik Roshan is expecting a lot from his home production 'kaabil' after two big flop films, 'bang Bang' and 'mohenjo Daro'
 honi bhi chahie, kyonki papa ke saath rithik hameshaa hit hi rahe hai
 Although 'krrish 3' did not get that much success, yet the industry is confident about Hrithik's 'kaabil' that it will remain a superhit
 bataa den ki shahrukh khan ne apni film 'rais' kii relies ke liye rithik se isi film ko thodaa khiskaane ko kaha tha
 However, the film's teaser, directed by Sanjay Gupta, has arrived and its poster, photos and trailer will also be released by 26 October
 ab jab tak aap inkaa intjaar karen, tab tak wo 5 baaten jaan len jo'kaabil' ke tijrase saamne ai hai -1
 The teaser of 'kaabil' does not see anyone's face, the voice of Ritik Roshan is heard
 jo bhi 'koi mil gaya' ke fain hai, ve yahaan rithik kii aawaaj kaa badlaav jarur mahasoos karenge
 In the teaser of 'kaabil', many actors get discharged in front of the seriousness and depth of Hrithik's voice
 padhein:tarif ke 'kaabil' he rithik kii film kii tiger2
 In the teaser of 'kaabil', the face of the face is seen, the eyes of Ritik, like her voice, are looking deep, serious and something
 
 
 ek-ek nas main utarati hui
 Of course, this teaser has managed to arouse interest for 'kaabil'
 3
 With this, it is also clear that 'kaabil' will be a film full of mystery
 tiger main kahani kaa kuch bhi khulaasa nahin hua he
 Hopefully, the suspense will continue throughout the film
 vaise bhi 'kaabil' kii kahani badale kii bhaavana par aadhaarit he or isi theme pararitik'agnipath' jaisi superhit film de chuke hai
 4
 'kaabil' kaa tiger # mindseesall hesh tag ke saath aayaa he or intens becoground score ke saathrithik roshanake dialog bilkul ye sabit kar dete hai ki har cheez dimag se hi control hoti he

 Read: When will the trailer of 'raees' 5
 'kaabil' ke tiger ko jab itani tarif mil rahi he to 'rais' kaa kya hoga
 
 
 However, what will happen to the film's release is not decided due to Pakistani actress Mahira Khanki
 phir 'rais' kaa concept darshak jaanate hai, 'kaabil' kii kahani abhi tak spasht nahin he
 But in one case, Hrithik beat his superior
 shahrukh 'rais' kaa trailor 2 november ko lekar aa rahe hai, jabaki rithik 26 oktober tak
 It seems so much that Hrithik will not allow Hrithik to become 'rais' easily at the box office

 'bijepi adhyaksh ne kaha, 'aaj mujhe 3 jagah janaa tha, jayanagar main to aa gaya magar duusari jagah mamata didi ke bhattije kii seat thi
 Mamta ji is afraid of our going there that if the BJP people gather, then the nephew's board will be inverted, so he canceled the permission of our assembly
 ' unhone kaha ki bengal main mamata didi, modi ji kii sarkaar kii kisi bhi yojana kaa laabh nahin milane detii, kyonki mamata didi maanati hai ki agar ye yojanaayen yahaan shuru huin to modi ji yahaan or zyada lokapriy ho jaaenge
 Addressing the public meeting, Amit Shah said, 'the people of Bengal have decided that this time they are going to put more than 23 seats in our leader Modi ji's bag
 mamata didi maanati hai ki unhen ghuspaithiyon ke vot chahie
 Durga Puja is not allowed under the rule of Mamta Didi, her goons assault on Saraswati Puja
 ' shah ne kaha ki 23 may ko jo matganana hone vaali he uske liye 19 may ko mamata kaa takhta palat dijie
 i guarantee that Durga Puja can be done again with grace in entire Bengal, such an atmosphere will form the BJP government here
 amit shah ne kaha, 'bengal ke islampur main mamata didi ne urdu ke shikshak bhej die
 When people protested against reading in Urdu, they sent police, two of our activists died due to police atrocities
 jabaki wo bas ye maang kar rahe the ki yahaan bengali bhashaa main padhai honi chahie
 If you want to reinstate the Bengali language inside Bengal, you will have to win the BJP by pressing the lotus sign button
 bengal main mamata didi ke raaj main ek bhi nai factory, nayaa kaarkaana nahin aayaa he
 Only bomb making factories are built here
 'isse pehle amit shah kii baruipur main somvaar ko hone vaali raily radd ho gai thi
 a party spokesman said that the owner of the land rented for the rally here withdrew his consent for the event, which led to the cancellation of the rally
 bijepi ke ek pravaktaa ne kaha, kuch kaarnon kii vajah se baruipur main raily radd ho gai
 This land was rented to build the rally as well as the helipad
 amit shah baruipur ke alaava dakshin 24 pargana ke canning or uttar 24 pargana ke rajarhat main bhi jansabhaayen karne vaale hai
 There was no change in the schedule of the other two meetings
 udhar bijepi ne bengal sarkaar par party adhyaksh shah ko jadhavpur main raily kii ijaajat nahin dene kaa aarope lagaate hue somvaar ko kaha ki nirvachan ayog party ko nishaanaa banane ke trinmul congress ke kathith aloktantric tareekon kaa maatr ‘mook darshak’ ban kar rah gaya he

 chunaav kii har khabar milegi sidhe aapke inbox main
 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter jab se ye khabar saamne ai he ki sindhiya loksabhaa main party ke netaa banane ke prabal daavedaar hai tab se party ke bheetar do kheme sakriy ho gaye hai
 One camp is one which is very close to Rahul Gandhi and the other camp is one which is close to Sonia, but the future team is not confident of getting a place in Rahul
 sindhiya kaa naam aane kii khabar ke baad rahul ke karibiyon kaa maananaa he ki rahul ke loksabhaa saansad rahete unke hamaumr or tej tarraar sindhiya ko netaa bananaa mufeed nahin hoga
 This may affect Rahul's stature
 is kheme kaa maananaa he ki rahul ko har morche par front se lead karte hue najar aana chahie
 Therefore, he should first become the leader of the party in the Lok Sabha
 isse unako anubhav bhi milegaa or unheen ko party kaa adhyaksh bananaa chahie
 This camp argues that Sonia was the leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha during the Vajpayee government while also being the party president
 congress kaa doosraa khemaayek alag khichdi pakaane main jute gaya he
 Those close to Sonia who can get out of Rahul's team have their own mathematics
 unki koshish zyada se zyada vakt sonia ko hi party adhyaksh banaaye rakhane kii he
 Therefore, it is the effort of this camp that Rahul should become the leader of the party in the Lok Sabha, so that Rahul, who talks about the principle of one person one post, will himself be removed from the post of party president for a few more days and Sonia will remain the president for a few more days
 
 is kheme kaa yah bhi tark he ki sonia ke adhyaksh rahane se unki varishthata or kad mahagathbandhan banane main zyada sahaayak hogi
 In fact, after the 2014 Lok Sabha election defeat, there is not a single election that the party has won and whose face should be tied on the head of Rahul Gandhi
 sutron ke mutabik in donon kii ek baat par sahmati he kisindhiya ko party mahasachivbana diya jaae or madhyapradesh se hi mahasachiv kamalnath ko pradesh adhyaksh banaakar bhej diya jaae, jis par kamalnath kii bhi sahmati he
 In the Congress, many camps become active before the name is leaked, come out and stop it
 kuch aisa hi sindhiya ke maamle main bhi hota najar aa rahaa he
 But, Sonia has almost made up her mind
 ab to bas rahul kii muhar lagani he
 In this case, the attempt is to get a veto from Rahul
 jo philhal to mushkil hi lagata he
 But until the announcement is made, there is a stir in Behala Congress
 agar aapako lagata he ki film kii shooting sirf lits, camera or ection tak hi simit he to aap galat hai
 Shooting of the film 'dilwale' is going on in Hyderabad these days and there is also a stormy work to finish the shoot

 southampton main bhartiya team 60 ran se jiti hui baaji haar gai, jisseenglandne paanch maichon kii siries main 3-1 kii vijayi badhat bana lee
 Chasing England's target of 245 runs, the Indian team could manage only 184 runs
 is haar ke baad bharat ke purv world champion captanakpil devne kaha- 'cricket ek team game he, kisi ek yaa do khilaadi par nirbhar nahin karata he
 Virat Kohli has scored more than 500 runs in the Test series, but despite this, Virat alone is not enough to win the match
 'kapil ne kaha, 'aap dekhe ki england ke captain jo root ne siries main utane ran nahin banaae phir bhi english team ne siries par kabja kar liya
 'he said that Team India made many mistakes on important occasions and lost successive wickets one after the other which cost him dearly
 'hamane khud england ko vaapasi kaa mauka diatelegraph kii report ke mutabik kapil ne kaha, 'yadi aap siries main peeche mudakar dekhen, to aapako pataa chalegaa ki hamaare paas match ke nattejey apane paksh main karne ke paryaapt maukey the, lekin hamane bahut sari galtiyaan kii or england ko vaapasi karne kaa nyotaa diya
 Kapil said, 'it is very easy to say that we lost the series, because England played better cricket than us
 lekin, mujhe abhi bhi vishwaas he ki ham unke mukaable behatar team hai
 Still, as i said, they fared better
 'gavaskar ne bhi uthaae the sawalsouthampton main haar ke baad purv captain sunil gavaskar ne bhi bhartiya team ke pradarshan par sawaal uthaae the
 Gavaskar said that 'virat's captaincy is no longer that thing
 unhone kaha ki saal 2014 main jab viraat ko test team kii captaini saunpi gai thi tab unhone team ko ek nayaa josh or disha dene kaa kaam kiya
 Gavaskar said, but from the time it was clear that Virat's real test would be in Australia, England and South Africa, because defeating teams like West Indies or Sri Lanka is not a big deal, that series is like practice matches for Team India
 Were
 'gavaskar ne kaha ki 'ballebaaj ke rup main viraat ne ummid se kahin behatar pradarshan kiya he lekin captain tabhi safal ho saktaa he jab uski team pradarshan karegi
 Expectations from Virat Kohli are always very high and something similar happened this time too
 yahi vajah he ki deshbhar ke cricket premi is haar se niraash hai
 Former captain Sunil Gavaskar said, "this defeat is disappointing and should be reviewed
" hamen dekhnaa padegaa ki koun se khilaadi team kii jarurat hai or kise baahar kiya ja saktaa he
 'team India missed out on making this record, let us tell you that this time Team India, captained by Virat, had a good chance to win the Test series on England soil after 11 years and after the series win under the captaincy of Rahul Dravid in 2007, the team a series win was expected here, but a poor performance in the batting made him miss this opportunity
 bharat or england ke bich paanchvaan or aakhri test match landan ke 'da ovel' maidan par khelaa jayega

 ) The second session of Halla Bol Manch of 'sahitya Aaj Tak' focused on the conflict between language and dialect
 'meri apni jubaan' satr main bhojpuri or avadhi ko lekar kaam kar rahe munna pandeya or amrendra treepathi ne hissaa liya
 Often when 'bhojpuri' is mentioned, some people associate it with vulgarity
 bhojpuri kii is chhavi par chintaa vyakt karte hue dilli uniwarsity main assistant professor munna pandeya ne isaki vajah casette culture ko bataaya
 He said that folk songs like Guddu Rangeela, Nirhua and Manoj Tiwari have created such an image of Bhojpuri through vulgar songs
 munna pandeya ne kaha ki ye log bhashaa ke balaatkaari hai
 Bhojpuri is an independent language, Awadhikai people argue that the words in Awadhi, Braj, Bundeli are close, so why should they be spoken as language? To this, teacher and thinker Amarendra Tripathi said that even in Odia and Bangla words are close, yet they are not called dialects
 aaj shabdon kii najdiki hone ke baavjood maithili bhashaa he use boli nahin kehete
 Therefore Avadhi, Maithli, Bhojpuri are an independent language, not a dialect of Hindi
 amrendra treepathi ne kaha ki bhashaa or boli main koi khaas antar nahin he
 a dialect that has grammar, literature and has a large population of speakers, becomes a language
 yadi boli taqatvar ho jaati he to wo bhashaa ho jaati he
 Munna Pandey said that the way in which the context of India is a fight for supremacy over Hindi, the fear that if Bhojpuri falls in the eighth schedule, then Hindi will be lost is a wrong concept
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki maithili ke alag ho jane se hindi ko nuksaan nahin hua
 Local languages, which are losing their identity in Hindi nationalism, Amarendra Tripathi said that due to Hindi nationalism, people left regional languages and started looking at Hindi with unity
 isi tarah urdu rashtrawaad ke chalate pakistan main sthaneey bhashaaon ne pahchaan kho di
 Amarendra said that if the Hindu shop is to be run then say that the Hindu is in danger, if the shop of Islam is to be run then say Islam is in danger, similarly Hindi is said to be a threat
 ab ye dukaan chalaane vaale angreji se nahin lard sakate kyonki inhen apane bacchon ko angreji main padhaanaa he, isliye choti bhashaaon ke liye aawaaj uthaane waalon se khatra bataa diya jaataa he

 BJP could not do this

 People were afraid of the difficulties in the world, but we do not have to be troubled by these difficulties because we are able to face these difficulties well

 rus ke raashtrapati bladimir putin apane bhaarte daure ke duusare din pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saath is sahmati par hastakshar hote dekhenge
 On the way to approve the S-400 deal, the two countries are trying to find a middle ground for the payment of this deal
 sutron kaa daawa he ki america se aarthik pratibandh kii sambhaavna ko dekhte hue bharat or rus is deal ko rupaya or rubal main karne kii sambhaavna talash rahe hai
 Significantly, in September, Russia signed a S-400 missile deal with China, soon after which US President Donald Trump decided to ban China
 is pratibandh ke chalate china ke liye america dollar kaa istemaal karte hue missile khareednaa naammumkin ho gaya
 However, during the last few years, China tried to make its currency the yuan as an international currency against the dollar
 is pahal ke baad antarrashtriya str par china lagaataar koshish kar rahaa he ki vah yuan ko dollar samet euro, yen or pounds kii tarj par antarrashtriya mudra bana le

 gauratlab he ki abhi tak bharat ne rus se kiye sabhi raksha saudon ko dollar ke madhyam se kiya he
 Why America's Katsa law was made? In August, President Donald Trump approved the Katsa law keeping in mind Russia's modern defense missile system
 america ne rus ko antarrashtriya str par america ke hiton ke khilaaf kaam karne se rokane ke liye yah kanoon taiyaar kiya he
 Significantly, this law of America has been made in view of the activities of Russia

 sp's mentor Mulayam Singh Yadav will be the chairman of this new front
 is maukey par shivpal yadav ne kaha ki netaji ke sammaan kii khatir nai party kaa gathan kiya ja rahaa he
 Just two days ago, he had indicated this in Etawah
 haalanki us dauraan unhone sapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav se kaha tha ki vah is pad ko chhod den or unki jagah mulaayam singh ko rashtriya adhyaksh banaaya janaa chahie
 It is worth mentioning that since the UP elections, MLA from Jaswantnagar in Etawah and former SP President of State Shivpal Yadav has been continuously targeting Akhilesh and party general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav
 usee kadi main pichley dinon akhilesh ke kareebi ramgopal par shivpal yadav ne itawa main nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 Attacking cousin Ram Gopal Yadav, he even called him Shakuni

 On this, Ram Gopal replied that Shivpal Yadav talks in vain
 unhone party kaa samvidhan nahin padhaa he
 The party's membership drive is going on
 shivpal to abhi sadsy tak bhi nahin bane hai
 The comments uske baad media ke logon ne shivpal yadav se jab yah baat doharaai to unhone kaha ki maine samvidhan bhale kii na padhaa ho lekin shakuni ko gita jarur padhani chahie
 Akhilesh Yadav had replaced Mulayam Singh as the President of the Samajwadi Party and became the National President himself during the UP Assembly elections

 chachere bhai ramgopal yadav par hamalaa bolte hue unhen shakuni tak kah daalaa

 is par bhadak kar ramgopal ne jawaab diya ki shivpal yadav bekaar kii baaten karte hai
 He has not read the constitution of the party
 party kaa sadsyta abhiyaan chal rahaa he
 Shivpal has not even become a member
 tippaniyan After that when media persons repeated this thing to Shivpal Yadav, he said that i may not have read the Constitution but Shakuni must read the Gita
 akhilesh yadav upi vidhansabha chunaavon ke vakt mulaayam singh ko samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh pad se hataakar khud rashtriya adhyaksh bane the
 He told the media that he had become the president for only three months and that he would return the post of national president to Netaji after the election
 mulaayam ke parivaar main ise lekar do faad he
 Aparna Yadav has also said that Mulayam Singh should be returned to the post of president
 unke parivaar main mulaayam singh yadav, unki duusari patni sadhana yadav or chote bete pratik yadav, bahu aparnaa yadav or shivpal ek taraf hai jabaki ramgopal yadav parivaar ke is vivaad main shuru se hi mulaayam or shivpal ke khilaaf akhilesh ke saath khadey hai
 Ram Gopal Yadav also had a big role in removing Mulayam from the post of national president

 " Former Jharkhand Chief Minister Babulal Marandi visited Mother Teresa's organization Nirmal Heart on Saturday and met people to take stock of the situation
 vahaan se lautne ke baad jharkhand vikaas morcha supremeo babulal ne aarope lagaaya ki nirmal hriday ke bare main jo bhi baaten media main aa rahi hai, wo rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (RSS) kii vichaardhaara se prabhavit bijepi sarkaar kii ek chaal he
 He said that the government should investigate the whole matter and then take action against the guilty
 sarkarmishanrij of charitika media trial kara rahi he, jisko roka janaa chahie
 Let us tell you that since the revelation of the sale of a childless mother in Ranchi with the connivance of a sister and employee of Missionaries of Charity, politics has started on it
 jharkhand ke purv mukhyamantri babulal marandi se pehle congress ke varisht netaa rameshwar oraanv nirmal hryday gaye the
 He had accused the state government of being unfair to the Missionaries of Charity
 vahiin, mishanrij of charity home main avaidh rup se navjaaton kii bikri ke maamle main police charity home kii sanchalika sistar koncilia or anima ko chaar din kii remand par lekar poochtacha kar rahi he
 On July 4, Anima Indwar, a servant of the Missionaries of Charity Home, was arrested by the police on the charge of the sale of a newborn to the Missionaries of Charity, an organization of Mother Teresa in Ranchi
 iske saath hi do or sistar ko hiraasat main lekar poochtacha kii gai thi
 It is alleged that many newborns have been sold so far in association with the female operator of Charity Home
 police ko die bayaan main ek sistar or sevika ne ye sweekaara ki haal hi main ek bachche ke evaj main 1
 Up to 20 lakh rupees were taken
 police kaa bhi kahana he ki khud anima or koncilia ne sweekaar kiya tha ki wo ab tak kai navjaat shishuon ko bech chuki hai
 Accused Sevika Anima had admitted that she had sold three newborns, while Sister Concilia told police that one child was sold after delivery from Sadar Hospital

 in chaaron aropiyon par mahila veteronari doctor ke saath rape kaa aarope tha
 The police claim that all these accused were trying to escape and during this period all the accused have been killed in the firing by the police
 police adhikariyon ne bataaya ki yah encounter shuukravaar tadake 3 baje hua he
 According to the information received, after filing the charge sheet in the court, these four accused were taken to the scene to investigate the 'scene of crime' (reconstruction)
 lekin unamem se ek aaropee ne pulicekarmi kaa hathiyaar chin kar bhaagane kii koshish karne laga
 Police officials said that if this accused had escaped, a big ruckus would have arisen, so the police had no other way and all the four accused were killed in retaliatory firing
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa vartmaan kaarykaal isliye desh ke raajnneetik itihaas main mahatvapurn mana jayega ki unhone jis dal ke saath milakar virdohi dal ko parajeet kiya usee dal ke saath dedh saal main phir sarkaar bhi banaai
 On the other hand, the allies in the election forced the opposition to sit in the opposition
 shanivaar ko bijepi ke saath nitish kumaar kaa do varshon kaa kaarykaal puraa ho jayega
 If we calculate the loss and profit of Nitish politically in these two years, then he appears to be in loss
 do saal pehle nitish kumaar ko gaiyr endie dalon main bahut majboot netaa mana jaataa tha
 Even he was considered a strong contender for the post of Prime Minister
 piem narendra modi ke liye chunauti bane rahane vaale nitish kumaar aaj unheen ke rahamokaram par bihar kii satta kii naiya khete najar aa rahe hai
 1
 sabase badi uplabdhi agar koi ek maani jaae to vah yah he ki bihar main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii shashan ke mukhiya ke rup main chhavi phir se kaayam hui he
 His influence with the RJD was weakened in the past
 rajd adhyaksh lalu yadav ke samanaantar sarkaar chalaane or unki hastkshep karne kii aadat ke kaaran sachivalay se block tak adhikariyon or karmchaariyon main asamanjas kii sthiti bani rahati thi
 2
 mantriyon main ab vibhaag ke kaam ke prati gambhirtha dikhti he
 Every minister is accountable to his department
 jiskaa nitant abhaav rajd ke saath shashan kaal main dekhne ko miltaa tha
 At that time Lalu Yadav had taken most of the departments into account of his two sons Tej Pratap and Tejashwi and the files of the departments were executed from the house before Lalu Yadav's eyes
 alam yah tha ki swasthya vibhaag kaa zimmaa tej pratap yadav ke paas tha jo kabhi krishna to kabhi shiv lila main vyast rahete the
 The government was always in the news due to their antics
 3
 The biggest thing is that in the name of coalition, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar no longer has to seek the consent of the ally for his decision in transfer or posting of an officer
 unka nirnay sabko maanya hota he
 This does not mean that BJP ministers are not able to transfer or post officers according to their mind, but they now request the Chief Minister for this
 jabaki lalu yadav adhikariyon, jinamein adhikansh daagi hote the, kii apane manmutabik posting karaane ko apana adhikaar samajhate the
 4
 jab vidhansabha satr chalata he to ab har vibhaag ke mantri apane sambandhit vibhaag ke sawaalon kaa kuch jawaab dete hai
 Whereas, in the government of the Grand Alliance, some or the other minister of Tej Pratap Yadav was authorized to answer the questions of his department in the House
 khud tejpratap ghar main baithkar doston ke saath bansuri bajaate the
 Due to this, the government was very bad
 5
 Due to the government of the same coalition at the center and Bihar, in many cases, now the results are seen quickly
 kai vikaas pariyojnaayen par kaam shuru ho gaya he or bahut sari nai pariyojnaayen bhi rajya ke aagrah par shuru kii gai hai
 Such as the Metro Rail Project in Patna, construction work of Darbhanga Airport, sanction of construction of new bridge parallel to Vikramshila Setu in Bhagalpur etc
 1
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not miss any opportunity to politically shorten his stature whenever Chief Minister Narendra Modi got an opportunity
 iskaa sabase pehla udhaaharan patna vishvavidhyalay ke dikshant samaaroh main dekhne ko mila tha jab mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke baar-baar guhaar karne ke baavjood patna vishvavidhyalay ko kendriya vishvavidhyalay kaa darja dene kii apil ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne usee manch se saarvajanik rup se khaarij kar diya tha
 Apart from this, whatever announcement he made there, it has not been implemented till date
 2
 When it came to giving a place in the Union Cabinet after the Lok Sabha elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi rejected Nitish Kumar's demand for proportional representation and offered him to take a position in the cabinet, like other allies, in short words
 jabaki isi loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan gathbandhan dharm kaa nirvaah karte hue nitish kumaar ne apana menifesto tak release nahin kiya
 On controversial issues, journalists will ask him questions and Nitish Kumar also kept a distance from the media to avoid any wrong message from the answer
 iske baavjood jab bihar main 40 siten milin, lekin tab bhi pradhanmantri narendra modi ne nitish kumaar kii baton ko ansuna kar diya
 3
 jahaan tak dabl ingine kii sarkaar kaa daawa kiya jaataa he to vah ab tak khokhla hi sabit hua he
 Whenever Bihar needs some special help, the central government loses its hand
 iske do jwalanth udhaaharan hai
 When there was a flood in 2017, the Bihar government fiercely undertook relief work among the flood victims
 tab centre kii taraf se aarthik madad kii baat ai to lekin jo raashi di gai vah itani kam thi ki koi iske bare main baat nahin karnaa chahta
 Secondly, when children died due to chlamydia fever in Bihar this year, it came to light that there was no need to fulfill the central government which had promised Bihar five years back that it will build ICU for children in Muzaffarpur
 Understood
 aise hi paanch varsh purv vitt mantri ne bihar main ek or ames ke nirmaan kii ghoshnaa kii jiskaa aaj tak shilanyas nahin ho paaya he, kyonki vah kahaan banegaa, is par maathapai jari he
 4
 bihar main nitish kumaar ne lalu yadav se bhrashtachar ko mudda banaakar apana sambandh todaa tha, lekin sachai yahi he ki vah chaahe tejasvi yadav or lalu yadav hon yaa unke parivaar ke anya log, unke khilaaf ghotaalon ke maamle main aaj tak chargeshit se aage baat nahin ban pai he
 Secondly, Nitish and BJP are also serious on corruption
 iskaa andaaza is baat se bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki sarkaar banane ke turant baad 2017 main ek srijan ghotaalaa saamne aayaa tha jisaki jaanch nitish kumaar ne turant CBI ko de di thi
 But the names of many BJP leaders and some leaders of Janata Dal United also came out in this scam and today it is probably the first scam in the country in which CBI has filed about a dozen chargesheets
 lekin is ghotaale ke mukhya abhiyukt priya or amit kii aaj tak giraftaari nahin ho pai he
 While they are in the country itself
 akhir in abhiyukton ko giraftaar na karne ke peeche CBI kii kya majaburi he, samaj se baahar he
 Just as most ministers did not work without money during the RJD rule, similarly corruption in the good governance this time with BJP is spread from top to bottom
 eemaandaar mantriyon kii sankhya paanch se zyaada nahin he
 5
 jab nitish kumaar bhaajapa ke saath waapas gaye ek ummid jaagi thi ki bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja mil saktaa he lekin aisa kuch nahin hua
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself, who has always been speaking in every meeting that till the time states like Bihar do not come under the category of developed states, the development of the country will not be considered in the true sense, but no such will from the center yet
 It appeared that the government of double engine in Bihar was successful
 duusari taraf bihar main ab mob linching yaa sampradayik tanaav ke kai aise maamle saamne aae hai jisamen BJP yaa RSS se sambandhit sanghathanon ke logon kii sakriy bhoomika thi
 This is seen for the first time when the ally in the government is making it difficult for the government
 jharkhand nirmaan ke das saal baad rajya main ravivaar ko pehali baar panchayat chunaav ke liye vot daale jaaenge
 The first phase of panchayat elections will begin on Sunday amid tight security and vigil
 rajya ke mukhya sachiv eke singh ne samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya, ‘rajya main 32 saalon baad panchayat kaa chunaav hoga
 Due to lack of panchayati system, the state has lost several hundred crores of funds given for development by the Center in the last several years
 ab hamaare paas yah suavasar he ki ham panchayat raaj ke chunaav dwaara rajya main vikaas kaaryon ko badhaava den
 'significantly, the state is going to have panchayat elections in five phases

 pakistan apni harkaton se baj nahin aa rahaa he
 Pakistani troops have again violated the ceasefire
 pakistani sainikon ne jammu-kashmir ke mendhar sector main ek baar phir golibari kii he
 The flag meeting of the two countries took place on 14 January amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan
 flag meeting ke baad ye chauthaa mauka he jab pakistan ne sangharshaviram kaa ulanghan kiya he
 Earlier, Pakistani troops had again violated the ceasefire on Monday night and opened fire with small arms at two Indian posts in Krishnaghati area in Poonch district
 pakistani sainikon ne somvaar raat kareeb saadhe nau baje chote hathiyaaron se kranti or kripaan chaukiyon par golibari kii thi
 India has accused Pakistan of violating the ceasefire five times since the flag meeting on Monday between the two countries at the Brigadier level
 haalanki, bharat ne yah spasht kar diya ki vah ‘jaldbaaji yaa gusse main koi kadam nahin uthayega’
 Defense spokesman in Jammu, Col
 RK Palata, said that the Pakistani Army fired at the Indian border near the Line of Control in Mendhar at around 5
45 pm on Tuesday evening
 unhone kaha ki kuch der tak goliyaan chalati raheen lekin bharat kii ore se iskaa jawaab nahin diya gaya
 No casualties were reported in the shootout
 palta ne kaha ki krishnaghati sector ke nangidikri main shaam saat bajkar 45 minute par bhi pakistan kii ore se sangharsh viraam kaa ulanghan kiya gaya
 Significantly, these cases of ceasefire violations have come at a time when the Indian Army Chief General Bikram Singh had given a strong message to Pakistan a day earlier, saying that India retains the right to retaliate whenever and wherever it wants
 isse pehle, bhartiya thalsena ke uttari kaman ke pramukh leftinent general ke tii parnayak ne samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main kaha, ‘brigadier str kii flag meeting ke baad bhi sangharsh-viraam ulanghan kiye gaye hai

 He said, 'we did not retaliate because their attacks had little power
 ham ghatnakram par najar banaae hue hai or thalsena ke paas kaaphi vikalp hai
 'he said,' We do not believe in responding in a hurry or a charge
 hamaari apni yojanaayen hai
 We will reply in time
 ’leftinent general parnayak ne kaha, ‘flag meeting main to pakistan apni galati maanane ko taiyaar hi nahin tha
 Pakistan stood firm on its insistence, adopted a stubborn attitude and was not ready to accept anything
 hamane unase kaha ki ham sangharsh viraam kaa paalan karnaa jari rakhenge lekin yadi hamen uksaaya gaya to aisa nahin hoga
 However, in response to questions from reporters, he said, "there is no such situation as war

 chah maichon kii vanade siries - bharat 5-1 se jeeta3
 Three matches T20 Series - India won 2–1 bhale hi saat samandar paar team india ke captain viraat kohli italy main abhinetri anoushka sharma ke saath saat phere lene vaale hai
 And these days they will definitely be busy in the wedding ceremony
 lekin unki najar dharmashala main aaj khele vanade mukaable par jarur hogi, kyonki isi srilanka team ko test main kohli kii aguwai main shikast mili thi
 Kohli would be wishing that Rohit Sharma would maintain his winning streak in odis as well
 lekin jis tarah se team india srilanka ke aage 112 ranon par dher ho gai, isaki ummid kisi nahin thi
 The team could not give a gift to Kohli on the wedding
 Actually, if Team India won the first ODI without a regular captain in Dharamshala, then it would have been the most wonderful wedding gift from Team India
 lekin team ko jo karaari haar mili use sunakar kuch pal ke liye kohli bhi hairaan ho gaye honge
 If Team India would have started with a win in the first ODI, then Kohli would have flocked happily, and would have got a 'win' gift from Team India and his partners before marriage, but it could not happen
 aise kai maukey aae jab kohli akele apane dam par vipakshi team se match chhinakar bharat kii jholii main daal di thi, lekin aaj dhoni ke alaava koi khilaadi maidan main ladate hue dikhaai nahin die
 Perhaps before fighting, the fear of defeat in the minds of the players had gone home
 berthde par bhi kohli kaa haath tha khaali!isse pehle pichley maheene kii 4 taarikh ko yani (4 november) ko rajkot ke cricket maidan membharat or newjilandke bich doosraa tii-20 muqabla khelaa gaya tha or is match main team india kii 40 ranon se haar hui
 You must be wondering why this match is mentioned here? It is important to mention that because the next day i
e
 November 5 was the birthday of Virat Kohli, if Team India wins this T20 match then it would have been the biggest birthday gift from the team to the captain
 
 
 
 So the birthday celebration would have been doubled but at that time the defeat was destined
 agar team jeet jaati to berthde jashn duguna ho jaataa
 But like today, the rest of the players could not support Kohli on the field that day
 or aakhri vakt tak akele kohli maidan par ladate rahe
 The victory turned into a loss as Kohli was dismissed
 kahaan gai wo team keeshandaar ballebaaji?gauratlab himachal pradesh cricket sangh stadium main aaj jab se match shuru hua, kabhi bhi team india main lay main dikhi hi nahin
 Virat Kohli was always missing in the field
 or ye daawey ke saath kaha ja saktaa he ki agar aaj maidan par kohli hote to parinaam kuch or hota
 Because the way Team India gave knee-jerk to Nesrilanka, it might not have been possible without Kohli
 dharmashala vanade main 7 wicket se jeet ke saath srilanka ne mejabaan team par 3 vanade maichon kii siries main 1-0 kii badhat le lee he

 Vinay Bansal was a 50% partner with his father Surendra Bansal
 isse poocha gaya ki mahadev koun si company thi
 He did not give a satisfactory answer to this
 iske baad asibi ne use giraftaar kar liya
 In this case on May 8 last year, three cases were registered against Surendra, Vinay Bansal and several officials of PWD
 asibi ne PWD ke chah ejiniyaron se 13 may ko poochtacha kii thi
 Investigation revealed that several bills for different works were approved by different companies
 kai farji bill lagaae gaye the
 Delhi government said political conspiracy: The Delhi government issued a note on the arrest of Vinay Bansal and termed it a political conspiracy
 note main likhaa he ki guuruuvaar ko asibi ne mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke rishtedaar vinay bansal ko giraftaar kar liya
 The facts of this case will make it clear that the arrest is entirely politically motivated
 vinay bansal ko bataaya niskriy bhagidaarvinay ke pita surendra bansal kii company kai saalon se peedblyoody ke saath kaam kar rahi thi
 Vinay is a passive partner in the company
 unki company ko peedblyoody dwaara ek naalee banane kaa kaam diya gaya tha
 The drain was made by the company
 iaiti rudki dwaara nirmaan kaa teesraa paksh pramanikaran kiya gaya tha
 The PWD also handed over the complete certificate

 After the FIR, the ACB investigated the work through Shriram Labs, which gave the work a clean chit
 peedblyoody kaa stand bhi susangat tha ki kaam puraa ho gaya tha
 'conspiracy to defame Kejriwal' That same year Surendra Bansal died
 unke baad is maamle main koi karrwai nahin hui
 But suddenly ACB arrested Vinay Bansal in this case
 jabaki pariyojna ko ek pratishthit agency or peedblyoody vibhaag se clin chit mil gayi

 In this, many fake companies were shown the work of crores and then by working on paper, money was grabbed
 'farji company dikhaakar gadabadi'isi enjio se jude patrkaar viplav avasthi ne bataaya tha ki hamaari ore se 150 se zyada artiai daali gayi, lekin sambandhit vibhaagon se koi jaankaree nahin di gai
 It is alleged that Surendra Bansal, the brother-in-law of Arvind Kejriwal, formed a company under the name Renu Construction and then bought the goods from Mahadev Impex
 'sirf kaagaj par hua kaarobaar'mahadev impex ne cell tex vibhaag ko di jaankaree main dikhaaya ki company ne naa to koi kaarobaar kiya, naa hi kisi se maal liya or naa hi kisi ko aage maal bechaa he
 That is, the work from drains to construction was done only on paper and the money was given from the government funds
 enjio ne kejariwal sarkaar par niyamon main gadabadi kaa bhi aarope lagaaya tha
 Currently, India has the fastest-minded people
 lekin ham unka istemaal puri duniya kii samasya kaa hal nikaalane main kar rahe hai
 Do you want to do something for your country too? If you are troubled by the problems of your country and you have an idea to solve it, then the Indian government will give you 20 lakh rupees

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 5 farvari ko purvi assam ke moraan kii chunavi raily main ye naaraa diya- 'aapke jivan main anand laana he isliye assam main sarbanand laana he'
 This statement of PM clearly shows that BJP is not going to rely on the face of PM Modi in Assam's election this time like the rest of the states
 assam vidhansabha chunaav ke liye bijepi ne yuva netaa or kendriya khel mantri sarbanandsonoval ko siem candidetghoshit kiya he or sonoval ke jariye vikaas ke agenda parasam ke chunavi maidan membijapi ko seen badalane kii puri ummid he

 Sonowal was made an executive member as soon as he joined the BJP
 vah assam bijepi ke pravaktaa bhi rahe hai

 One of them is Hanumantha Rao of Congress and the other is Ramesh Rathore of TDP

 Why did this happen? In fact, the two parties started a credit war to provide relief to the people of Andhra Pradesh

 One is Divorce Expert Sid, ie Madhavan, who has divorced himself after a bad marriage experience, and the other is Sonali, that is, Bipasha Basu, who has divorced even to her grieving parents
 
 
 lekin asli kahani tab shuru hoti he, jab ye donon milakar ek sukhi vivaahit jode ko alag kara dete hai
 
 
 The comments diarector ashvini choudhary kii 'jodi brakers' main cid or sonaali bahut mazedaar dhang se jodiyaan todate hai, jisaki vajah se pehle half main acchhee kamedi he
 
 
 The funniest anecdote is that of a wrestler whose wife needs more love
 
 
 'thri idiyats' kii tarah 'jodi brakers' main bhi omi vaidya ne galat hindi main bhaashan dekar hansaaya he
 
 
 The intermittent glamorous dance numbers also entertain
 
 
 bipasha or madhavan par achche romantic seens filmaae gaye hai, or khaskar bipasha nai taazgi or khubsuurati ke saath lauti hai
 
 
 There is a twist in the story after Interval, which keeps it complicated
 
 
 second half main kamedi kii jagah letaa he lite romantic drama, or yaheen se film thodi thakee hui lagati he, lekin yahaan helen chote se role main jaan daalati hai
 
 
 The manner in which 'pair breakers' break pairs is also far from reality, but goes into comedy

 In director Ashwini Chaudhary's 'jodi Breakers', Sid and Sonali break up the pair with fun, which is a good comedy in the first half
 
 
 sabase mazedaar kissa ek pahalwaan kaa he, jisaki bivi ko zarurat se zyada pyaar chahie
 
 
 Like 'three Idiots', in 'jodi Breakers' too, Omi Vaidya has laughed in a wrong Hindi speech
 
 
 bich-bich main glamras dance numbers manoranjan bhi karte hai
 
 
 Good romantic scenes have been shot on Bipasha and Madhavan, and especially Bipasha has returned with freshness and beauty
 
 
 interval ke baad kahani main mode aa jaataa he, jo uljhaae rakhata he
 
 
 Light takes the place of a comedy romantic drama in the second half, and from here the film looks a bit tired, but here Helen lives in a small role
 
 
 jis dhang se 'jodi brakers' jodiyaan todate hai, vah bhi asaliyat se dur he, lekin kamedi main chal jaataa he
 
 
 Overall 'pair breakers' is the entertainment package, and our rating for this is 3 stars

 ) film 'jal' main mukhya bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai, purab kohli, kirti kulkarni, tanishta chatarji, mukul dev, ravi gosain or yashpal sharma
 'jal' is the story of Bakka, who is believed by the people of the desert to be the god of water and who finds water in the desert only by the power of the mind
 bakka yani purab kohli apane dost or uski bahan ke ghar main hi rahata he or uske dost kii bahan kajri yani tanishta chatarji use man hi man chaahati he, par bakka kii pasand he, dushman gaanv kii kesar yani kirti kulkarni
 Bakka's love story is a small but important part in the film, but 'jal' is the story of a man thirsty in the desert, where money is worth more than money, money, or jewelry
 film main tourist ke taur par rus ai saida jules, jo yah dekhakar pareshaan ho jaati he ki ran of kuccha main flemingos khaare pani kii vajah se mar rahe hai or vah unhen bachaane kaa faisla karti he
 With the help of the government, water dispenser is called and the God of Water discovers the water, while modern technology outperforms the skill of Bakka
 'jal' manoranjan ke saath ek sandesh bhi detii he ki duniya or desh ko flemingos kii to chintaa he, par pyaas se marate insaanon kii nahin
 The first thing i would like to compliment is cinematographer Sunita Radia, who has filmed Ran of Kutch very beautifully
 uske baad tanishta or kirti kii adaakaari kii
 Mukul Dev has also played his villainous role well
 purab bhi apane kirdaar main achche hai, par marusthal ko baaki gaanvvaalon ke saath apane chehre-mohare ke saath ghulaa-mila nahin pate
 Maybe they really needed to stay in the desert for a few days, otherwise the makeup should have worked a bit more
 film ke moments kahani ko slo kar dete hai or isaki vajah shaayad yah bhi he ki kamedi gholkar jo moments rachane kii koshish kii gai, vah ham pehle bahut dekh chuke hai, jaise gori mem kii taraf gaanv kaa aakarshan
 Trying to get comedy because of not understanding English
 kaash kamedi ke liye kuch nae nuskhe aajamaae jate
 Also, some actors were a bit loud, that is, their acting seems to be acting in the theater, but still this film keeps you tied
 girish malik kii acchhee koshish par nirdesan main thodi pakad or jaruri he
 Good music and screen play by Sonu Nigam and Bikram Ghosh
 kul milakar yah 'jal' un darshakon kii pyaas bujhaayegi, jo bollywood kaa khaaraa nahin balki meetha pani pine ke aadi hai

 The Central Government banned the Indian Mujahideen from being declared a terrorist organization in June this year and after that, it has come back to the headlines for the first time in Varanasi claiming an explosion

 Was like giving
 guuruuvaar ko sansad main prastut rapat main kaig ne air india, nagar vimaanan mantralay se lekar sarkaar kii bhoomika par sawaal khadey karte hue kaha he ki lagata yah sauda vikreta prerit tha
 Describing the initiative to buy a large number of aircraft as a risky step, the report said that this should have raised the ears of the government
 in vimaanon kii kharid se pichley saal march tak vimaanan company par 38,423 karod rupee kii baari rin dendaree kaa boj aa gaya
 In the report, the government auditor termed the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines as a merger done at the wrong time
 rapat main kaha gaya he, yah sankat ko daavat thi or isse nagar vimaanan mantralay, saarvajanik nivesh board or yojana ayog ke kaan khadey ho jane chahie the
 The CAG suggested the government to take a fully pragmatic approach regarding the management of the airline
 kaig ne jaanch main paaya ki adhigrahan prakriya main anuchit taur par lanbaa samay laga
 The CAG stated that the initial proposal was made in December 1996 and the review continued till January 2004 when a plan to purchase 28 aircraft was formulated and later it was decided to change it to purchase 68 aircraft
 kaig ne kaha ki sanshodhit yojana main kharide jane vaale vimaanon kii sankhya main naatakeey dhang se badhotaree kii gai or november, 2004 tak jo ghatnakram ghatie hue usase saaf he ki vilay se purv air india ne apni purv kii yojana par jaldbaaji main kaam kiya
 "the market requirements, including the immediate needs and future requirements, as well as the commercial viability of the rationale given for these acquisitions, do not fit into the scrutiny of the audit conducted on increasing the number of aircraft," the report said
 kaig ne 68 vimaanon kii kharid prakriya kii tej gati par tippanee karte hue kaha ki jahaan 28 vimaanon kii kharid kii pehali yojana par nirnay karne main 8 saal lag gaye, par agast, 2004 or disambar, 2005 ke bich air india dwaara duusari yojana taiyaar kar lee gai, use board ne manjuuri de di, nagar vimaanan mantralay, yojana ayog, vyay vibhaag, lok nivesh board, mantriyon ke adhikaar praapt samooh or aarthik maamalon kii cabinet cameti dwaara isaki samiksha kar manjuuri de di gai
 Finding many of the projections faulty for the revised plan, the CAG said the negotiation process was irregular and severely affected the transparency of the process
 kaig ne kaha ki keemat kii tulana or vyavsaayik sooyeeboojh ke sambandh main koi benchmark tay nahin kiya gaya tha
 In the absence of such a benchmark, it is difficult to determine how the price was arrived at
 sarkari ankekshak ne air india ko vikaas kaa samaan avasar uplabdh nahin karaane vaale deshon ke saath dwipaksheeya vaayu yatayaat paatrata main udaartaa dikhaane ke liye nagar vimaanan mantralay ko katghare main khadaa kiya
 In this situation, Indian carriers, including Air India, will have to deal with new and serious challenges in competing effectively with established international giants, the CAG said
 kaig ne air india ke khasta haal ke liye jimmedaar anya karkon main parichaalan khaamiyon, kamjor vittiya sthiti, aparyaapt equity puunji or rin ke jariye vitt poshan par anuchit nirbharta ko ginaya
 In addition, the high prices of aircraft fuel and the global slowdown also severely affected the airline
 kaig ne kaha, vimaanan company ek sankat kii sthiti main he
 It is becoming increasingly difficult to pay salary and ATF liabilities
 agar vimaanan company ko jivit rahanaa he, prabandhan or karmchaariyon ko vyaktigat hiton ko alag rakhana hoga or kuch kathor nirnay karne honge
