 ‚Äô‚Äô Mumbai BJP president Ashish Shelar said that the results of the Bhandup by-election have proved the "hollowness of the big claims made by some"
 unhone haalanki kisi kaa naam nahin liya
 He said that this is a victory of the development agenda of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis
 shivasena ne jahaan chaar anya parshadon ke samarthan kaa daawa kiya he vahiin bhaajapa ne do anya parshadon ke samarthan kaa daawa kiya he
 Reacting to the result, BJP MP Kirit Soumaiya said that the ally Shiv Sena leaders should give up their arrogance

 '' mumbai bhaajapa ke adhyaksh ashish shellar ne kaha ki bhandup upachunaav ke nateezon ne ‚Äò‚Äòkuch logon dwaara kiye gayi bade daavon ke khokhalepan‚Äô‚Äô ko sabit kar diya he
 He did not name anyone
 unhone kaha ki yah pradhanmantri narendra modi or maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ke vikaas ke agenda kii jeet he
 Mumbai BJP president Ashish Shelar said that the results of the Bhandup by-election have proved the "hollowness of the big claims made by some"

 He said that this is a victory of the development agenda of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis
 isamen kuch nayaa nahin ki jab aap kisi ek jagah zyada vakt ke liye kaam karte hai, to mumkin he ki aapkaa bos aapse umr main chota ho
 In this case, this gap of age can cause problems on the work front
 jaane kam umr ke bos ke saath sukh-chaiyn ke saath kaise kaam kiya ja saktaa he:jaldbaaji nahin:agar bos noujvaan he, to kharaab bos hoga, aisi dharna bilkul bhi nahin banaae
 Think positively
 khud se umr main chota bos ek bhaavnaatmak maamla he, to isse bhaavnaatmak dhang se hi nipatna hoga
 If we are not able to do this, then the functioning will be affected
 apni akl lagaaie:offis main aam taur par suni-sunai baton par vishwaas kiya jaataa he
 If the age is more, then the speed of work will be less, age is less, then it will be sticking to the smartphone, these are all assumptions, stay away from them
 hamaare jamaane main aisa hota tha, in baton kaa istemaal karne se bhi koi phayda nahin hoga
 Look at the new thing, the new person from a new perspective - try it
 sammaan jaruri:bhale bos umr main aapse kam hoga, lekin agar wo kaabiliyat naa hoti, to wo is ohade tak nahin pahunchataa
 There may be differences, but this does not question his efficiency
 agar kam umr hone ke baavjood bos majboot netritv or sakaaratmak saajhedaari muhaiyaa karaata he, to umr se koi fark nahin padataa
 Ready for change: Keep an open mind and always be flexible about working
 kam umr vaale bos aam taur par baithkon ke bajaay phone, mail par zyada baatcheet karnaa pasand karte hai
 If you think of the boss as a partner and ally, then you will be able to understand his problems and also help in finding solutions
 Teach Boss: The best way to help teach a boss younger than you is to tell him what he is not
 knows
 offis main aap pehle se kaam kar rahe hai, to aapke zarie bos tak kai ahm jaankaree pahunch sakati hai
 Just give information, don't give him anything like advice or lecture, talk, talk will happen, talk will happen: No matter how much there is a difference in age between you and the boss, the most important thing is that the two of you should be in harmony
 or uske liye baatcheet hona behad jaruri he
 It is very important to know what is expected of you
 samvedansheel rahen:itane saal se aapane jo jaankaree or anubhav kamaaya he, uske saath chup rahanaa kuch mushkil he, lekin koshish kiijie
 Avoid behavior that offends the younger generation
 apane manager kii tulana apane bacchon se kabhi mat kariye
 Do not pretend that you know everything
 jaise hai, vaise rahen:jaisaa hamaara bos hota he, ham vaisaa hi banane kii koshish karte hai
 But this is wrong, do not do this
 umr main jo faasla he, use kapade yaa rahan-sahan badalakar bhi nahin badla ja saktaa
 Doing this will raise more questions than you, which is not good
 apane bos ko jaanane ke liye aap coffee yaa doosraa koi brake le sakate hai

 jaankaron kii raay main shivasena ko centre main narendra modi kii sarkaar se bhi khatra lag rahaa he
 Let's know 10 things why Shiv Sena is afraid of BJP
 
 
 1
 Shiv Sena feels that if more seats were given to BJP in the elections and it becomes more powerful, then BJP will run the agenda of Delhi i
e
 Chief Minister will do all the work with the consent of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 sena choti hoti chali jaaegi
 2
 us haalat main sena tut kii kagaar par pahunch jaaegi, vah apane logon kaa khyaal nahin rakh paaegi to uske log bijepi kaa rukh kar sakate hai
 3
 modi ke taqatvar deveopment prachaar or hindutv kaa cocktail, sena kii pahchaan ko khatm kar saktaa he
 4
 ek baar hathiyaar daalane kaa matlab hoga ki sena kamjor he or uddhav kii bal thakare jaisi tuuti nahin bolti
 5
 bijepi ke nae slogan main shivaji ko bahut pramukhataa he or shivaji ko modi ke naare se jod diya gaya he
 That is, the plate form of the regional identity can be completely taken away
 6
 The army is witnessing the results of allies during Modi's era and earlier also, in such a situation, it feels that if it is not seen on its feet, then the BJP will outnumber it
 saath main sena ko lagata he ki zyada acha jayalalita vaala formet he
 Where cooperation will be given according to need
 7
 The Sena feels that this is an accurate opportunity to pressurize the BJP
 8
 The BJP did not negotiate in Delhi, did not give anything to power and did not talk on big issues, so this is the right chance to get its share
 9
 Many BJP leaders are regretting breaking up with the Army and promoting Ahem
 10
 The BJP wants to isolate the army by drawing the remaining regional parties to itself

 (input:bhashaa) Although there has been consistent evidence about the plot of 26 / 11 attacks in Mumbai and the role of the Pakistan Army and ISI in providing support for them, India is preparing to resume talks with Pakistan

 One of the accused in the 26 / 11 conspiracy, Tahawwur Hussain Rana, recently revealed before a US district court that he had acted on behalf of Pakistan's ISI

 In Thimphu in April last year, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tried to ease tensions with Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani

 This has happened despite the fact that Pakistan has done nothing to check the terrorism spreading from here, while it is a necessary condition for the resumption of the composite dialogue halted after the 26 / 11 attacks

 During a 34-hour interrogation that took place in New York in June last year, Headley revealed that every major action taken by Lashkar was monitored by ISI

 According to the employees union, the government was not working towards resolving the crisis

 The US military has dropped its most powerful bomb in the Afghan province of Nangarhar, on the threshold of Pakistan
 lekin america ke raksha visheshgy maan rahe hai ki raashtrapati trump ne nishaanaa bhale hi afghanistan par lagaaya ho, lekin unki najar darasal uttari korea par he
 Why ISIS was not the real target? Many American experts are assuming that if the purpose of America was to break the back of ISIS, then this bomb could have been dropped in Syria or Iraq
 hakeekat ye he ki 'madar of ol bombs' ko aatanki thikaanon ke khilaaf dizin hi nahin kiya gaya tha
 This is the reason why the Bush and Obama administrations never thought of using it against terrorist targets
 kam se kam kaagajon par america kii sainya ranneeti sthaneey aabaadi ko dil jitkar aatankiyon ko haraane kii he naa ki unka safaya karne kii
 So dropping such a powerful bomb against terrorists cannot be part of this strategy
 yun bhi iesas afghanistan main taliban jitna bada khatra nahin he
 The Afghan people, the US military and the Taliban themselves also vie for enmity with this organization
 uttar korea ko sandeshhakeekat ye he ki 'madar of ol bombs' iraq yuddh ke dauraan banaaya gaya tha
 It is designed only to destroy underground nuclear targets
 iran ke alaava uttar korea ne bhi aise hi kai thikaane banaae hai
 It is no secret that the US administration has tightened its stand against North Korea after Trump took power
 pichley dinon china ke raashtrapati se mulaakaat ke baad donald trump ne do-took kaha tha ki agar beijing pyongyang par lagaam nahin kas saktaa to america usase apane tareeke se nipatega
 Washington's concern has increased that North Korea has conducted three of the total five nuclear tests during the last five years
 inamen se do pichley saal hi kiye gaye hai
 The Deputy Foreign Minister of North Korea has made it clear that his country will not miss testing the atomic bomb again if needed
 isse dakshin korea or japan jaise america ke sahyogi desh asurakshit mahasoos kar rahe hai
 It is also no coincidence that the US used the Mother of All Bombs on 13 April
 jabaki 15 april ko uttar korea ke taanashaah kim jong un kaa janmdin he
 Pakistan must end its network of terror
 raksha mantri e ke antni ne buudhvaar ko pakistan ko spasht lahaze main paigaam diya ki bahanebaaji se kaam nahin chalegaa
 Pakistan will have to take concrete action against terror this time
 antni ne ye bhi kaha ki bharat ne apane saare vikalp khule rakhe hai
 Pakistan did what was feared
 mumbai hamale ke sabooton ko usne bina dekhe-parakhe khaarij kar diya
 But Pakistan cannot save its skin through such trickery
 bharat ne ek baar phir pakistan se do took kah diya he ki wo kisi mugalate main nahin rahe
 India has kept all its options open
 raksha mantri e ke antni ne kaha ki pakistan ko apane yahaan chal rahe aatank ke network ko khatm karnaa hoga
 Terror camps imparting terrorism training will have to be demolished
 gauratlab he ki mangalvaar ko pradhanmantri ne bhi pehali baar mumbai hamalon ke liye sidhe sidhe pakistan kii sarkari agenciyon ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha or ab antni ne saare vikalp khule hone kii baat kah kar pakistan ko kadaa paigaam diya he
 By denying the evidence given by India, Pakistan has proved that it has absolutely no intention to act on terrorists
 aise main bharat ke paas apane duusare vikalpon par gaur karne ke sivaa doosraa kya rasta he
 The world too understands this trick of Pakistan very well
 america sahaayak videsh mantri richard bouchar ne ek baar phir mumbai hamalon main pakistani sajeesh kii baat ko kabool kiya he
 Meanwhile, the US Ambassador and the British High Commissioner met with the Foreign Secretary
 pakistan kii taraf se sabooton ko nakaare jane ke baad america or british rajanyikon kii ye mulaakaat kaaphi ahm maani ja rahi he
 Another hallmark of the worldwide public opinion against Pakistan's terrorist policy is the statement of US National Security Advisor Stephen Headley, in which he has clearly stated that Pakistan's condition has become the biggest cause of concern for the US government

 RC Jain, the representative of the Private School Management Committee in Delhi, says that the private schools in Delhi government have considered their enemy as a fee and that is the reason why the management of the private school is given notices on daily notice
 jisaki vajah se management skool sanbhaalane se zyada court or daftaron ke chakkar lagane par vakt bitaate hai
 In fact, the statistics show that in the last three years, the result of private school has fallen down to ten percent
 dilli main sarkari skulon kaa rigelt privet skulon ke rigelt se behatar aayaa he to sarkaar jamkar jashn manaa rahi he

 For every household and parent who has a young son and who loves speed
 jise raftaar kii chaabi aap log dete hai
 Yes yes 
 You parents
 dilli kaa ek noujvaan bhi raftaar kii aisi hi kisi bike par savaar hokar sadak par nikalataa he or phir khud uski jindagi kii raftaar par brake lag jaati he
 Perhaps he wanted to say that live, live every moment and do not live even one moment without life
 tabhi to raftaar uski zindagi thi
 Thrills his breath
 super bike par savaar hokar hawa se baaten karnaa uskaa junun
 And the roar of the bike's engine was its music
 pataa nahin usne apni fasebuk post main yun hi kuch line likh di thim yaa phir sachmuch zindagi ko lekar uskaa yahi nazariyaa tha
 He was only 22 years old
 is umr main aksar fasebuk par khushnuma tasviren, gudgudati baaten, hansaati yaaden yahi sab to post karte hai log
 But at the same age, friends started sending tributes on Facebook like this
 RIP likhane lagen, tasviren maala pahan len or baaten yaaden ban jaaen to kalejaa chalni ho jaataa he
 He was 22-year-old Himanshu Bansal of Delhi
 jo ab is duniya main nahin he
 His reason for not being in this world is nothing but his love at speed
 saadhe saat lakh kii apni super bike par savaar himanshu kii ek sadak haadase main maut ho gai
 But Himanshu is not the only one responsible for this death
 balki har wo maa-baap hai, jo apane bacchon ke laad-pyaar main use maut ke kareeb dhakel dete hai
 In 9 seconds, if the bike catches 100 speed from zero, it also cuts at the same speed of breath
 maaloom nahin ye baat kab samaj aegi un maa-baap ko
 When parents hold the keys of speed in their hands, if parents consider this aspect a little, then this weeds will be removed from many homes
 aankade kehete hai ki desh main har saal sadak haadase main kareeb dedh lakh log maare jate hai
 That is 17 deaths every hour
 marane waalon main se kareeb tees fisadi wo log hote hai jo tu whealer par savaar hote hai
 That is, bike and scooter riders are about 44 thousand deaths out of 1
5 lakh people who died in a road accident
 inamen se bhi kareeb bees fisadi maut akele bike savaar kii hoti he
 Usually, the youngest among the people who die by bike
 jo raftaar kaa shikaar hote hai yaa phir res kaa
 India is the youngest country in the world
 sabase zyada naujavaanon kii taadaad bharat main hi he
 But in this way, the increasing number of young deaths on the roads should be a matter of concern not only for the government but also for every household and family who bring their boys in the race to death
 5 agast, 26 janvari, diwaali, shabe-baraat jaise khaas maukon par bike racing ab dilli main salanaa event banataa ja rahaa he
 Bikers gangs and stunt masters risk their own lives on common roads in illegal and dangerous ways, they also harm others
 is chakkar main ab tak kai jaane ja chuki hai
 But instead of decreasing the thrill of speed is increasing
 zaahir he ise rokane kii jimmedaari police or kanoon se kahin zyada maa-baap kii he

 Due to such tremendous feedback, this season of Bigg Boss was added to the act for five weeks
 is actension ke baad ek taraf phens khush the to vahiin duusari taraf unhe is baat kii maayusi thi ki salmaan khan sho ko host nahin karenge
 Actually Salman is busy busy promoting his upcoming film Dabangg 3 and has also started preparing for his film Radhe
 isi ke chalate aisi khabaren aa rahi thim ki sho ko farah khan host karne ja rahi he
 But it seems good news has emerged for the verdict
 salmaan khan hi karenge big bos hostkhud salmaan ne apane weekend ke waar main is baat kaa khulaasa kiya ki big bos ne is sijan ko paanch hafte ke liye ekstand to kar diya he lekin unki fees gata di he
 During the video conference, Siddharth Shuklase says, Salman says, "bigg Boss makers have added the show for five weeks
 wo aise hi mujhe pareshaan karte rahete hai
 They have extended the show but reduced my fees
 'big bos ne kii salmaan kii fees kam ?ab ek jagah ye khushi kii baat he ki salmaan khan kii big bos ko host karte rahenge, vahi ye sochane vaali baat he ki kya sach main sho ke mekars ne salmaan kii fees kam kar di he
 This is surprising because the news always keeps going with Salman's increased fees
 haal hi main khabar ai thi ki salmaan khan kii fees par episod 2 karod rupee badha di gai he
 In such a situation, when Salman says that his fees have been reduced, it becomes difficult to believe

 Google released a teaser of Pixel 4 some time ago
 ise tiger kahen yaa li, kyonki jo squair shaped rier camera modul vaale smartphone kii photo li hui thi use hi google ne share kiya tha
 Apple is launching new iphones this year and a similar camera module can be offered in the new iphone
 google ne Pixel 4 ke bare main or bhi jaankariyaan share kii hai
 This time the company is offering some new features in Pixel smartphones
 tiger ke mutabik is baar phase analock or moshan sens diya jayega
 Face Unlock looks like Apple's Face ID, as this front camera is not based and there are separate sensors for it
 google ke mutabik company moshan sens par kaam kar rahi he
 The company has said, 'our team has been working on Advanced Technology and Projects Team (ATAP) Soli for the last five years, it is a motion sensing radar
 ye vahi radar he jo dashakon se plane or duusare large objects ko detect karne ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he‚Äôhaalanki is tarah kaa feechar pehle Sony Ericsson ke phone main diya gaya tha, haalanki ye chal nahin paae
 What is the work of this feature and how it will work in Pixel 4 will be interesting
 darasal moshan sens ke tahat bina tach kiye hi smartphone ko control karne kaa kaam kiya janaa sambhav hota he
 Users can play the phone by hand movement
 Google ne apane blog post main iske bare main bataate hue likhaa he, ‚Äòpixel 4 pehla divaais hoga jisamen Soli diya jayega, ye hamaara nayaa moshan sens feechar hoga jiske tahat aap sirf apana haath wave karke gane skip kar sakate hai, elarm snooj kar sakate hai yaa phir kol aane par silence feechar kaa yuj kar sakate hai
 This is just the beginning and as Pixel gets better over time, the same will happen with Motion Sense '
 Google has said that the top of Pixel 4 will have a miniature version made by the company which will move the movement around the phone
 Will sense ise unic software elgoridm or hardware sensorer ke saath marz kiya gaya he, taaki ye jescher ko detect kar paae
 This feature sounds really amazing to listen to and it can be more with Pixel 4
 lekin pench ye he ki google ne lage haath ye bhi ishaara kar diya he ki ye kuch deshon ke liye hi hoga
 Google has been doing this in the past as well, many features of Pixel smartphones are not available in India and these are only for some cities of America
 ab ye moshan sens vaala feechar bharat aayega yaa nahin ye bada sawaal he
 Talking about Google Face unlockgoogle Face Unlock, for the first time the company will offer the feature of Face Unlock
 company ke mutabik phase analock duusare smartfones kii tarah hi ho saktaa he, lekin ise alag tarah se taiyaar kiya gaya he
 The company has also said that another phone has to be picked up, then a way has to be seen in front of it, then swipe to the home screen
 Pixel 4 main diya jane vaala kaaphi strimalind hoga, Soli ke jariye jaise hi aap phone tak pahunchenge wo sensor analock kar degaa or elgoridm aapako pahchaan legaa
 As soon as that algorithm recognizes you and you pick up the phone, it will be unlocked
 phone ko aap kaise bhi pakadenge phase analock kaam karegaa, chaahe phone ko ulta bhi pakadenge to ye kaam karegaa
 Through this, secureauthentication can be done
 Google ne privesi par bhi baat kii he or kaha he ki facial ricognishan technolji kaa jo bhi data hoga wo yujar ke phone main hi rahegaa or ye google ke sarwar par nahin jayega
 Titanium m Security chip will be given in Pixel 4 where this data will be secure

 2
 supreme court ko die afidavit main kaha gaya tha ki personal lau board muslim samudaay ko samajhaayega ki desh main teen talaak na hone paae
 Despite this, there have been 300 triplets divorces in 2017
 3
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the problem of triple talaq is estimated from the fact that there have been more than 100 triple talaq cases since the Supreme Court has ruled triple talaq illegal

 This includes Bangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia and Pakistan where legislation to prevent triple divorce is enacted

 ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki bangladesh main kanoon maujuud he ki talaak dene ke liye pehle likhit main suchit karnaa hota he
 If a person has divorced without notice, then there is a provision of 1 year sentence and fine
 vahiin pakistan main bhi isi tarah kaa kanoon maujuuda he
 8
 afghanistan, morokko, misr jaise kai deshon main bhi tripal talaak ko regulate karne ke liye kanoon banaaya ja chukaa he
 When Islamic countries are regulating three divorces and saying that divorce cannot be said thrice at a time, then why India needs to stay away from this provision

 Abdi said that both RCA and BCCI are entities registered by the Co-operative Societies Registrar, and only the registrar can constitute such ad hoc committee if needed
 kathith taur par bisisiai purv ballebaaj brijesh patel kii adhyakshata main ek paanch sadasyeey samiti gathit karne kii yojana bana rahaa he, jo nilambit aaarasie kii jagah rajasthan main cricket ke maamalon kaa kaamkaaj sanbhaalegi
 Advani for RCA president and former Indian Premier League (IPL) commissioner Lalit Modi said that even the BCCI constitution does not allow formation of such ad hoc committee
 abdi ne buudhvaar ko ek vaktavy jari kar kaha, "sahakaari samiti panjiyak or rajasthan sarkaar ne aaj (buudhvaar) spasht kar diya he ki rajasthan khel adhiniim-2005 ke tahat panjiyak hi is tarah kii tadarth samiti kaa gathan kar saktaa he tathaa panjiyak ke alaava anya koi bhi vyakti yaa sanstha tadarth samiti gathit karne kii adhikari nahin he

 " The BCCI suspended it shortly after Modi was elected the RCA President in December last year

 Like last year, Jammu and Kashmir also received snowfall this time
 aatankiyon ke dhamkiyon se pehle hi halkaan seb kisaanon par is baar barfbaari pichley baar ke mukaable or zyada hataasha lekar ai
 According to Tanveer, an apple farmer in Srinagar, at least 60 percent of the apples were wiped out by this untimely snowfall
 yah poochne par ki sarkaar is nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye kisaanon ko harjaana to degi, tanwir kehete hai, '' pichley saal kisaanon ko 600 ru
 Rs 1500 or 1000 ru
 Damages awarded yah to ek peti seb ke nuksaan kii bharpai ke baraabar bhi nahin tha
 "they account for the apple orchards," one acre contains 7-8 canals
 ek kanal main 15-17 ped hote hai
 a tree produces at least 20 boxes of apples
 ab aap hi bataaiye ki kya jo harjaana yahaan seb kisaanon ko mila vah jaij tha?'' tanwir kehete hai, ek taraf aatanki hai jo seb kii petiyaan mandi le jane ke khilaaf dhamkiyaan dete hai to duusari taraf barfbaari main hue nuksaan par sarkaar harjane ke rup main aisi rakam dekar kisaanon kaa makhul karti he
 On this question, Tanveer says, "yes, and bought too
" lekin 5,000 petiyaan agar kisi kisaan ne nefed ke adhikariyon ke saamne rakhin to usamen se mahaj 100-150 petiyaan hi nefed ne kharidne ke liye chuni
 "if the government really wants to do well," says Tanveer, then Nafde should have set up rules for purchasing meetings and meetings with local farmers
 lekin aisa nahin hua
 National Farmers Federation spokesman Abhimanyu Kohar says, though the condition of the farmers is not right, but the government should be more sensitive towards the farmers of Jammu and Kashmir
 pichley maheene hi punjab se aae do seb vyapaariyon ko aatankiyon ne nishaanaa banaaya
 One died in it
 isse pehle shopiyaan se seb bharkar rajasthan le ja rahe trek driver ko bhi aatankiyon ne goli maari
 This driver also died

 We are going to hold a meeting this month in all the districts of the valley
 isamen seb kisaanon ko mandi tak seb laane ke liye suraksha dene, nefed dwaara seb khariddaari jaise masale shaamil honge
 Market Intervention Target Scheme launched in September for apple farmers
 In September this year, Governor Satyapal Malik launched the Market Intervention Target Scheme (market Intervention Target Scheme) for apple farmers in Srinagar
 is yojana ke antargat centre sarkaar kii nodel kharid agency yaa eneefidi (NAFED) ke jariye kisaanon se laabhakaari mulyon par sebon kii kharid kii ja rahi he
 But this scheme is also unable to compensate the losses of farmers
 aakhir ghati kaa seb kisaan kyon hai itnaa mahatvapurn?jaar hastkshep lakshya yojana (market intervation torget skim) ko launch karte vakt rajyapal satyapal malik ne khud hi ve aankade pesh kiye jisase andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki jammu- kashmir kaa seb kisaan aakhir itnaa mahatvapurn kyon he?unhone bataaya, kashmir duniya main doosraa sabase bada seb paidaavaar centre he
 75 percent of the country's apples are grown in Jammu and Kashmir
 yah yojana kisaanon kii kamai main jabardast ijapha karegi
 The governor said that C-grade apples are 40 per cent of the total yield, at present Rs 3 to seven per kg
 hi kisaanon ko mil pate hai lekin is yojana ke lagu hone ke baad iskaa mulya prati kilo doguna or tiguna ho jayega
 The governor said that apple market turnover is 8000 crores per year, and 7 lakh families are directly and indirectly connected to it
 unhone kaha ki is sector par or dhyaan die jane kii jarurat hai
 He said that now NAFED will buy everything from the farmers and the prices for every kind of apple will increase
 rajyapal satyapal malik ne kashmir main seb kisaanon ko dhamkaane vaale aatankiyon ko bhi chetaya
 Malik said that such people should improve as soon as possible, otherwise the government will take strong action against them
 malik ne kaha, "ham kisaanon kii raksha karenge or unhen suraksha denge, jo kisaanon ko dhamka rahe hai, unke khilaaf tatkaal karrwai kii jaaegi
 "explain that after the abolition of Article-370 from Jammu and Kashmir, some anti-social elements have tried to attack the farmers who are sending apples out in a quandary
 malik ke is bayaan ke agle maheene hi aatankiyon ne punjab ke do seb vyapaariyon ko goli maari or sebon se bharaa trek rajasthan le ja rahe ek trek driver ko bhi goli maari
 Threats are constantly being received to apple farmers
 nefed se kisaanon ko ummid thi lekin bagan main seb khariddaari ke liye pahunche nefed adhikari gunvattta ko aadhaar banaakar sebon ko riject kar rahe hai

 After a decade of efforts, Masood Azhar, the leader of the terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed, has been declared a global terrorist by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)
 khaas baat he ki bharat ne masood ajahar ko jis pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad vaishvik aatanki ghoshit karaane kii purajor koshish kii, uskaa yuan kii website par zikr nahin he
 40 CRPF personnel were martyred in this attack on 14 February 2019
 pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad america, britain or france ne jo prastaav diya tha, usamen pulavama aatanki hamale kaa zikr tha
 China objected to Pulwama over this
 bharat, china or pakistan ke bich kai daur kii vaarta hui
 China has since lifted its veto after the reference to Pulwama was removed
 masood ajahar par china chaar baar vito laga chukaa he
 Indian sources said that India had been trying for 10 years to declare Masood Azhar a global terrorist
 iske liye kai saboot die gaye
 Recently, there was a terror attack in Pulwama
 vaishvik aatanki ghoshit karne kii kaarywahi sirf kisi hamale ke bare main jaankaree dene se nahin balki sabhi sabooton ko dene ke baad hui he
 Sources say that we were not preparing the bio-data of Masood Azhar, which mentions every terrorist attack he has done
 hamaara makasad use vaishvik aatanki ghoshit karana tha or ham isamen safal hue hai
 Indian Ambassador to the United Nations Syed Akbaruddin while talking to India Today said that it was a diplomatic and all-out effort that we succeeded in
 haalanki, akbaruddin ne yah bataane se philhal inkaar kar diya ki is ahm kootnithik jeet ke peeche kii kahani kya he
 He said that we were trying since 2009
 ab hamen safalataa mil gai he
 Meanwhile Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesman Dr
 mohammad faisal ne kaha ki maujuuda prastaav par ise pulavama se jode jane kii koshishon ko hataane sahit sabhi raajnneetik aitaraajon ke baad sahmati bani
 Pakistan will implement the ban on Azhar immediately
 unhone ise bharat kii kootnithik jeet maanane se inkaar kar diya he
 Well, experts believe that the credit for the changed attitude towards Masood Azhar to China also goes to America, Britain and France
 bharat ke liye yah badi uplabdhi he hi
 Now Pakistan will be forced to take action on Masood Azhar
 centre sarkaar dwaara laae ja rahe neshnal medical kamishan bill (enemasi) ke virodh main dilli ke indira gandhi stadium main ravivaar ko bees hajaar doctor ekajute hue
 Doctors under the banner of Indian Medical Association protest against the National Medical Commission (NMC) bill in # Delhipic
 twitter
 com / mrvhqkmngo ‚Äî ANI (@ANI) March 25, 2018 Doctors say that with the introduction of this bill, the level of treatment will go down across the country
 kyonki is bill main praavdhaan he ki 6 maheene kaa brij course karke koi bhiayurveda or unanidoctor allopathy kii bhi dawa likh sakegaa
 Indian Medical Association (IMA) officials from all over the country opposed the bill being brought by the central government from the contractors who were involved in the program
 indian medical association ke adhyaksh ravi vankhede ne kaha ki is bill ke aate hi puraani sanstha medical council of india khatm ho jaaegi
 After that the responsibility of framing policies like medical education and service of the country will fall in the hands of this new institution, the National Medical Commission
 is kamishan ke sabhi sadsy sarkaar appoint karegi
 In such a situation, the government will have complete control over it
 kya hai nae bill kii khaas baaten-is bill ke aate hi puure desh camedical sansthanonmen daakhile ke liye sirf ek pariksha lee jaaegi

 This institution will also fix fees for 40 percent seats in private medical colleges of the country

 After the introduction of this bill, after doing a 6-month bridge course, Ayurveda and Unani doctors of the country will also be able to prescribe allopathy medicines like MBBS doctors
 gauratlab he ki desh kii sabase badi doctoron kii sanstha indian medical association ne is bill kii khilaafat karne kaa faisla kar liya he to aise main centre sarkaar ne agar jald koi kadam nahin uthaaya to mushkil khadi ho sakati he
 After the arrest of four miscreants in Haryana, a heartbreaking incident has been revealed in Behror, Rajasthan
 lut ke baad badmaashon ke gang ne ghar main ghoosekar maa-baap ke saamne hi do betiyon ke saath gangrape kiya tha
 In Gunti village near Jaipur Delhi highway, four miscreants entered a house and first robbed around 70 thousand rupees in cash and 5 lakh rupees ornaments at the tip of the weapon
 iske baad maa baap ko bandhak bana kar unki do jawan betiyon ke sathgang repaki vaardaat ko anjaam diya
 The whole family is shocked by this dreadful incident
 haryana police kii siaiu kii team ne in 4 aropiyon ko giraftaar kiya he, jahaan unhone 6 jagah lut kii vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke baad rape kii vaardaat ko anjaam dena sweekaar kiya he 
 More than 150 other robbery and theft incidents have been accepted
 philhal in 4aropiyonko production warrant par gudgaanv se alvar laayaa gaya he
 After these miscreants admitted robbery and gang rape in the village of Gunti in Behror, the victim's family reached Bahrod police station
 parivaar kii do ladakiyon ke saath dushkarm kaa maamla darj karavaaya he
 Earlier, the police had not been told about the gangrape in shame
 police ne peeditaaon kaa medical karavaaya he
 These accused have committed robbery incidents at 6-7 places in Alwar district
 maamle kaa khulaasa us samay hua jab gudgaanv police ne 4 badmaashon ko giraftaar kiya to unhone police kii poochtacha main bataaya ki unhone alvar ke bahrod main lut kii vaardaat ko anjaam diya tha
 Two girls had also gang raped at the tip of the weapon
 is tarah kii vaardaat badmaash haryana or gudgaanv main kai jagahon par anjaam de chuke hai
 On July 21, the family of the rape victim lodged the report of the robbery at the police station, but did not register the report of the rape due to the threat of the accused along with the local public and slander
 badmaasho ke dwaara police main shikaayat karne par jaan se maarane kii dhamkee bhi di gai thi
 The victim's family said that at around 12 o'clock on the night of July 20, four armed bandits came in, who tied the parents in the same room and gang-raped the two girls in the same room and carried out the robbery
 badmaashon ne parivaar kii do lakadiyon se gang rape kiya or unase bandook kii nok par khaanaa banwaaya or khaanaa khaaya or subah aaraam se naha dhokar gayi the
 Since the incident, the family was in awe and there was a fear of slander, but now the accused have been caught, so we fearlessly informed the Behror police about the rape case
 thanadhikari baherod mahavir singh ne bataaya ki peedit parivaar thane main aayaa tha or unhone lut ke saath gang rape bhi kiya isaki report di he
 In the pre-recorded trial, sections of gang rape have been added and the victims have been given medical treatment
 nokia, naam sunate hi puraani yaaden taaja ho jaati hai
 Recently, Nokia has been bought by HMD Global, a Finnish company
 reports ke mutabik nokia independent rup se android smartphone ke saath jald bazaar main hogi
 Former CEO of Rovio Entertainment, Peca Rantella has been appointed Chief Marketing Officer of HMD Global to bring back the lost credibility
 aapako bataa den ki peka rantella nokia keglobal marketing ke purv visapresident bhi rah chuke hai
 The famous smartphone game Angry Birds is also made by Rovio Entertainment, whose CEO was Rantella
 rentaila 1994 se 2011 tak yani 17 saal nokia ke alag alag departments main kaam karte rahe
 After sales and marketing-operations, he was made Senior Vice President, after which he became CEO of the Finnish company Rovio
 haal main wo electronic industry ke liye sarvice dene vaali company jot automation ke chairman the
 It is being told that Nokia is working on tablets and smartphones running on Android
 rentaila phir se nokia main waapas aa gaye hai lekin is baar unke paas badi jimmedaari hogi
 Because the lost credibility of the company cannot be returned so easily
 smartphone kaa bazaar ab kaaphi badal gaya he or ab pehle se zyada companiyaan bazaar main hai
 The state cabinet is meeting on Tuesday under the chairmanship of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, in which many important decisions can be taken
 cabinet kii baithak ke baad soobe ke vitt mantri rajesh agarwal vitt varsh 2019-20 kaa pehla anupoorak bajet pesh karenge
 The supplementary budget is likely to be around 15 and a half thousand crores
 sutron kii maane to cabinet kii baithak main uttar railway ke lakhanu-barabanki railway line ke kisaan path (faijabad road se mohanlalganj road tak) uparigami sethu nirmaanadhin hai
 The Public Works Department has sent an action plan for its completion to the Cabinet for consideration
 iske alaava shahjahanpur, bareli va muradabad main atal naveekaran or shahari roopantaran mishan ke tahat sap saal 2017-20 ke antargat sivarej yojana se jude prastaavon ko manjuuri di ja sakati
 Focus on Ganga and Ayodhya, as well as Ganga and Ayodhya are likely to get a bigger focus in this budget
 iske alaava infrastracchar va vikaas se judi chaalu yojanaon ko puri raftaar milegi
 The government may announce several new schemes
 bataa den ki kumbh ke dauraan prayagraj main yojit cabinet baithak main pashchimi upi ke meerut se purvanchal ke prayagraj ko jodne ke liye ganga express-ve banane kaa faisla hua tha, lekin sarkaar ne aam bajet main iske liye paise aavantit nahin kiye gaye the
 In such a situation, a budget can be announced to make a DPR of this project in the supplementary budget
 meerut se purvanchal ke prayagraj ko jodne ke liye ganga express-ve 600 kimi
 About 36 thousand crore rupees are estimated to be spent on this project in a phased manner
 iske alaava purvanchal express-ve, bundelkhand express-ve ko aage badhaane ke liye bhi bajet milane kii ummid he
 The impression of religious agenda can be seen in this supplementary budget of the Yogi government
 ayodhya ke paryaton vikaas ke liye 100 karod rupee mil sakate hai
 In this, the project related to the installation of the idol of Lord Ram is likely to gain momentum
 isi tarah naimisharany ke vikaas ke liye 10 karod rupee mil saktaa he to agra ke mughal museum ke liye bhi 10 karod milane kii sambhaavna he
 Talking about US President Barack Obama and talking to him himself, even if through electronic means, i am not giving up the temptation to use the line i used for Narendra Modi's closest predecessor
 vah yah ki itihaas unka akalan patrakarita ke mukaable zyada udaartaa se karegaa
 If you read the international media, especially in America, the same kind of liberal comments will show that Obama can never take the right steps
 un par kaam karne se zyada bolne, apane lakshya se hatane, america kii bigadi raajnneeti ko sahi raste par laane main asamarth hone kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa he
 But a batsman who is playing his innings in the middle of the innings will probably say that look at the score board, not the batting
 media turant apana faisla suna detaa he, gambhir tippaneekaron ke paas bhi kisi itihaaskaar jitna dhairya nahin hota he
 But look at the facts that appear, or, as i said, look at the score board
 aarthik manch par europea niraashaa ke bich ek acchhee khabar yah aa rahi he ki america arthvyavastha kii vruddhi dar phir se bad rahi he, jo 3
 Has reached 5 percent
 19 kharab dollar kii arthvyavastha ke liye yah bahut badi baat he, jisase vahaan rojgaar badaae ke saath khushhaali aa rahi he
 On the foreign policy front too, he deliberately worked to remove the army from Iraq and Afghanistan and forged an alliance against ISIS
 ve cuba or iran ke saath bhi baatcheet kii nai shuruyaat kar rahe hai
 Apart from this, many recent initiatives, which were slowing down, are paying renewed attention to them
 bharat ke saath nayaa sambandh bhi unamem se ek he
 Thus, we have to note that on the occasion of Republic Day, Obama is coming as a powerful and successful American President who has a clear vision of India
 i-mail par hui is vishesh or vistrut baatcheet main ve bharat ko ranneetik sahyogi nahin, balki swaabhaavik sahyogi bataate hai
 This is more important, as the term "strategic" has limited potential
 ve bharat ke saath kai muddon jaise aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai, jalwaayu parivartan or ibola jaisi beemaari par aapasi sahyog kii sambhaavnaaen dekhte hai
 Obama also openly responded to a question on the importance of personal relationships in international relations
 unhone modi ke saath apane sameekaran ke bare main bebaaki se baat kii
 Obama also acknowledged a good relationship with Manmohan Singh
 ‚Äò‚Äòchaay bechney vaale se pradhanmantri banane‚Äô‚Äô vaale modi or unase janata kii baari apekshaaon ko samajhate hue obama baatcheet main garmjoshi or anaupchaarikta kaa ehsaas karaate hai
 By the standards of foreign leaders, Modi is not a young leader, but for India, especially for not belonging to any family, he is very young and we can see good friendship between him and Obama
 chunki ab kai rashtron ke netaa apekshaakrit kam umr ke hai, isliye unamem zyada anaupchaarikta dekhi jaati he or ve ek-duusare ko pratham naam se hi sambodhit karte hai
 British Prime Minister David Cameron, for example, says Obama addresses him as a "bro" (friend)
 ham nahin jaanate ki unke nijee sambandh kaise hai, lekin obama ne ganatantr diwas par mukhya atithi banane kaa modi kaa nimantran sweekaar kiya
 Maybe, as Obama said, our planetary condition is finally meeting
 unki vistrut baatcheetabataur raashtrapati aapke kaarykaal main pehle bharat ke saath sambandhon main garmjoshi ai thi
 You came to India on your first foreign tour and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was an official guest at the White House
 iske baavjood dharna yahi he ki nai dilli or washington ke sambandh kamjor hue hai
 Do you agree that mutual relations need to be strengthened quickly? Are you and Prime Minister Modi taking fast steps in this direction? Ever since i became the President, building a deep connection between the two countries has been a major part of my foreign policy
 apane pehle sarkari daure main hi maine bharat se dosti ko mahatv diya tha
 i visited India early after becoming President, because i strongly believe that the relationship between America and India can be one of the important partnerships of the 21st century
 ham swaabhaavik sahyogi hai
 Being both a large democratic country, our strength lies in the strength and capabilities of our citizens
 udhyami desh hone ke kaaran ham nae prayog, vigyaan or takneekee ke kshetra main global leader hai
 By strategically looking at India's geographical location, we can increase our security and prosperity in the asia-pacific region
 jab bharat or america milakar kaam karte hai to donon hi desh or vishwa zyada surakshit or samrudh hote hai
 That is why when i addressed the Indian Parliament in the last visit, while expressing my views, i told you how we can become global partners in facing global challenges
 haalanki yah sahi he ki is disha main hamaari apekshaaon ke mutabik utani teji se pragati nahin hui he, lekin bharat-america sambandhon ko pragadh karne main ham safal rahe hai
 In the last few years, we have increased the trade between the two countries by almost 60 percent and provided more employment for Indians and Americans
 hamaari senaayen pehle se zyada sanyukt abhyaas kar rahi hai
 We have increased mutual cooperation against terrorism to a great extent and we are working together to stop the spread of nuclear weapons
 ham africa main krishi ke vikaas ko badhaava dene main bhi aapasi sahyog kar rahe hai
 My personal relations with former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh were close and he was a close associate
 ab pradhanmantri modi kaa chunaav or aapasi sambandhon main ek nae adhyay ke prati unki patibaddhta hamen apni bhagidaari badhaane kii disha main ek nayaa avasar muhaiyaa kara rahi he
 i would like that planetary condition is finally found so that the idea that i had expressed in Parliament can be fulfilled i
e
 India and America can become true global partners
 isiilie maine ganatantr diwas par mukhya atithi banane vaale pehle america raashtrapati ke taur par nimantran sweekaar kiya
 It is a great honor for me
 main raashtrapati pranab mukherjee, pradhanmantri modi or bhartiya janata ke saath bhartiya samvidhan ke 65wein vaarshik samaaroh main shaamil hone ke liye utsuk hum
 i am also proud that i am going to be the first US President to visit India twice and i will be accompanied by my wife Michelle once again
 jahaan main is daure ke pratikatmak mahatv ko samajhta hum, vahiin main ise pradhanmantri modi ke saath milakar thos pragati kii disha main ek avasar ke rup main bhi dekhtaa hum
 Hopefully, we will be able to start a new era in the history of relations between the two countries
 bharat or america ke bich achche sambandhon ke liye kya baaten jaruri hai?sabase buniyadi str par kahen to bharat or america ke rishte unheen siddhanton par aadhaarit hone chahie, jinke aadhaar par duniya main duusare deshon ke saath hamaare achche sambandh hai
 For this, mutual respect is also necessary, where we respect each other's qualities by accepting each other's different histories and tradition
 aapasi sambandhon ko majboot banane ke liye aapasi hiton kii pahchaan karnaa bhi jaruri he
 There is no doubt that more jobs and opportunities will be available to our people when we work together and move forward
 koi bhi do desh har baat par ekamat nahin ho sakate hai, isliye bharat or america bhi ek-duusare se asahmat ho sakate hai
 But i believe that we can work with a sense of mutual respect even with any kind of differences
 itnaa hi nahin, hamaare bahut se aapasi hit matbhedon ko gaun kar sakate hai
 This requires good dialogue and coordination, not only between the leaders of the two countries, but also between the two governments
 jab ham netaa ke taur par kisi baat par sahamat ho jaaen to hamaari sarkaron ko chahie ki hamaare faislon ko amal main bhi laayaa jaae
 We have to decide that what we say should also be implemented
 bharat-america sambandhon ke maamle main meri raay main aise kai khaas kshetra hai, jahaan ham apane prayaason par dhyaan de sakate hai
 Our emphasis in both countries is to improve people's daily lives
 isamen naukariyon or rojgaar ke avasar taiyaar karne, shiksha ko sudhaarney or ladakiyon tathaa mahilaon samet sabhi logon ke liye zyada sambhaavnaaen taiyaar karnaa shaamil he
 We can work together towards reducing barriers in the way of trade, investment and high-tech cooperation
 america companiyaan buniyadi suvidhaayen taiyaar karne main madad dene ko taiyaar hai
 These basic facilities will act as a catalyst for Indian growth
 ham svachh vaayu, paryaapt jal or bijli ke maamle main bhartiya janata kii dasha behatar banane ke pradhanmantri modi ke prayaas main milakar kaam kar sakate hai
 Our civil nuclear agreement can also be helpful in this
 ham apana suraksha sahyog bhi badha sakate hai, jisamen asia-prashanth kshetra main samudri suraksha bhi shaamil he
 And i believe that becoming a global partner also means that we work together on the problem of climate change, one of the most urgent challenges in the world
 antarrashtriya sambandhon main nijee mitrataa kitna mahatv rakhti he? kripaya aap pradhanmantri modi ke bare main apni raay bataaen
 My personal relationships with other leaders are important, as they can often be helpful on difficult issues between governments that are usually encountered, even in allies and allied countries
 pradhanmantri modi kaa aitihaasik chunaav saaf taur se tamaam bharatiyon kii ummiido or aakankshaon ko parilakshith karata he
 Their expectations include economic growth that is inclusive, good government that serves its people, and education that can make Indians efficient and qualified
 or pradhanmantri modi kii shandaar jivan yatra-ek chaay bechney vaale se upar uthakar pradhanmantri bananaa-bhartiya logon main safalataa paane ke drudh nishchay kaa pratibimb he
 i was very happy to welcome Prime Minister Modi to the White House in September
 maine unhen nimantrit kiya tha kyonki mujhe laga ki unke kaarykaal ke shuru main hi unase milanaa jaruri he taaki ham unki nai urja or unke chunaav se judi ummiido kaa puraa phayda uthaa saken
 He has a clear vision to make India achieve great achievements
 main badi aarthik vruddhi hasil karne ke raste kii baadhaon ko dur karne ke prati unke nishchay or unki urja se kaaphi prabhavit hua hum
 i especially appreciate his willingness to strengthen indo-us relations
