 This money should not be received by the contractor until he completes the first mile stone and the next mile stone at the right time

 According to the CAG, the gurgaon-jaipur highway failed on these scales and earned 459 from its toll

 But it cannot be terminated immediately as it is agreed by both NHAI and the contractor

 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh conducts different types of daily, weekly, monthly activities at 52 thousand places in the country
 pichley ek saal main dainik baithkon kii sankhya main 3,000 kii badhotaree hui he
 The Sangh claims that 75 per cent of those who took part in daily activities were under 45 years of age
 lekin iske baavjood sangh apane rajnatik sanghathan bijepi ke saath sambandhon ko lekar khud ko chauraahey par khadaa paa rahaa he
 There is a lot of controversy in the Sangh for giving a second term to BJP President Nitin Gadkari, but he is not in the mood to give its advantage to the opponents of Gadkari in the party
 chennai main beete saptaah (2-4 november) sampann akhil bhartiya kaaryakari mandal kii baithak ke baad sangh yahi sandesh detaa dikh rahaa he
 Sangh chief Mohan Madhukar Rao sees Bhagwat's association with the BJP as it is the only political face of the family
 isliye jab unhone sangh kii kaman sanbhali to sabase pehle dilli main baithe netaaon ko ‘di-4’ kii sangya dekar adhyaksh kii daud se baahar kar diya
 Not only this, Bhagwat had sent a clear message to the then state president of Maharashtra, Gadkari, who is junior in the party and not a national image, to Delhi that the organization is big, not the leader
 lekin gadakari ko doosraa kaarykaal nahin die jane ko lekar party ke bheetar chal rahi muhim se sangh ko ashanka he ki vartmaan adhyaksh ke hatane se dilli main baithe netaa yaa kisi anya naam par sahmati nahin banane kii sthiti main laalkrishna adwani khud aage aa sakate hai, jabaki sangh kisi bhi surat main party kii kaman ko dobaaraa unke haath saunpane ke mood main nahin he or usne 6 november ko bijepi kor group meeting ke faisle se apni is ranneeti kaa izhaar karvaa diya he
 After controversial statements comparing the IQ of Gadkari's Swami Vivekananda and Dawood Ibrahim and allegations of corruption being leveled at his company Purti, leaders like Ram Jethmalani opened the front in public, an atmosphere was created that Gadkari was forced to resign Go
 lekin sutron ke mutabik gadakari ne sangh pramukh bhagwat ke nirdesh par pehle bayaan ke liye maafee maangi
 After this, Bhagwat called and warned the Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley and former party president Rajnath Singh
 is ghudki kaa asar bhi dikhaa or gadakari ke bachaav main sushamaa-jetali ke hastakshar se saajha bayaan jari hua
 The Sangh has tried to intervene to stop the ongoing dispute within the party immediately, but the union leaders remained unconvinced at the informal meeting in Chennai
 haalanki sangh kaa maananaa he ki bhrashtachar ke aaropon se pareshaan congress ne sajeesh karke gadakari par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 But its political benefit will be given to regional parties
 sangh ke ek varisht netaa bhagwat kii yojana ke bare main kehete hai ki gadakari ko hi doosraa kaarykaal dene kii sambhaavna he, lekin koi pareshaani hui to dilli main baithe netaaon kii bajaae sangh gadakari jaisaa hi koi turup kaa patta saamne laa saktaa he
 After the Chennai meeting, Sarkaryavah Suresh Joshi aka Bhaiyyaji of the union said clearly on the allegations of irregularities on Gadkari's company, "how can we (gadkari) be wrong on the basis of mere allegations
 nishpaksh jaanch kii jarurat he
 However, just before the meeting in Chennai on October 31 and again on November 5, about a dozen senior leaders of the Sangh held a detailed discussion on the stir in the BJP
 sutron ke mutabik sangh ne tay kiya ki agar gadakari ke khilaaf koi kanoonee aadchan yani mukadmaa darj nahin hota yaa kisi sarkari agency kii report main ungali nahin uthaai jaati, to unhen doosraa kaarykaal diya janaa chahie
 But he has not yet taken a final decision in this regard
 deepawali ke baad bhaiyaji joshi 19-20 november ko dilli main pravaas kar bijepi ke varisht netaaon ke saath is vishay par manthan karenge
 However, Sushma Swaraj has been standing with Gadkari in the latest controversy
 sutron ke mutabik sushamaa ne unhen bharosa diya he, ‘‘jab tak sangh aapke saath he, tab tak meraa saath rahegaa
 "therefore, in the past, four BJP leaders Rajnath Singh, Murli Manohar Joshi, Yashwant Sinha and Jaswant Singh had separately met Advani and teased Sushma to make him the national president
 isamen rajnath behad sakriy the, kyonki unki najar loksabhaa main vipaksh ke netaa kii kursi par thi or iske jariye unka makasad 2014 main piem kii kursi kii daud main pramukhataa se shaamil hona tha
 But in the battle of ambition at the top level in the BJP, the Sangh, upset by the party's victory, has tightened its grip

 Departed for Dandi, located far away
 24 dinon kii yatra ke baad 6 april, 1930 ko dandi (dandi) pahunchakar unhone samudratat par namak kanoon ko todaa
 Mahatma Gandhi made Navsari his stop in the last days of the yatra after Surat, Dindori, Vanz, Dhaman during the Salt March
 navsari se dandi kaa faasla lagbhag 13 mile kaa he
 For these reasons, Mahatma Gandhi did not receive the Nobel Peace Prize even after being nominated 5 times
 bataa den ki bharat main angrejon ke shashankaal ke samay namak utpaadan or vikray ke upar badi maatra main kar laga diya tha or namak jivan jaruri cheez hone ke kaaran bharatvasiyon ko is kanoon se mukt karne or apana adhikaar dilwane hetu ye savinay avagya kaa kaarykram yojit kiya gaya tha

 saal ke pehle din tivi par intervyuu or 24 ghante ke baad hi 2019 loksabhaa chunaav kii pehali raily
 
 
 One by one, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has started laying the electoral board
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav prachaar kaa aagaaj guuruuvaar ko punjab ke gurudaspur ke raily ke jariye kiya
 PM Modi has plans to conduct a total of 100 rallies in 20 states in january-february
 jabaki vipakshi dalon kii ore se kisi bhi party ne abhi tak chunavi bigul nahin foonka he
 In this way, BJP seems to be making an edge in this year's biggest political fight
 loksabhaa chunaav kii ghoshnaa se pehle piem modi ne 20 rajyon kii aisi 123 loksabhaa siton par reliyaan karne kaa focus kiya he, jinhen 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main modi lahar ke baavjood bijepi jeet nahin saki thi
 In such a situation, the PM has now made a strategy to reach the voters of these seats through government programs and public meetings
 haal hi main hui vidhansabha chunaav main madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main bijepi ne satta ganvaai he
 There are a total of 65 parliamentary seats in these three states
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main inamen se 62 siton par jeet mili thi
 In such a situation, repeating the previous results in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019 is a big challenge for the party
 vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey agar loksabhaa chunaav main tabdeel hote hai to phir bijepi kii kareeb 28 se 30 siten kam ho sakati he
 In such a situation, Modi has started repairing his fort before the Lok Sabha elections are announced
 iske liye unhone pichley chunaav main haari hui 123 siton par pehle focus kiya he
 There is another strategy of the BJP behind this that due to not having its own MP in these seats, the risk of anti-incumbency at the local level is also less
 aise main in siton par modi ke chehre kaa zyada se zyada istemaal kar chunaav main camel khilaane kii ranneeti he
 BJP leaders had already started preparing for the 2019 election
 piem modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne pichley ek saal se reliyaan ke jariye sarkaar kii yojanaon ko logon tak pahunchane kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 Apart from this, BJP had met with celebrities from various fields through 'sampark for Samarthan'
 bijepi ke 4000 se adhik kaaryakartaaon ko ek lakh logon se milane or sarkaar kii uplabdhiyaan unhen bataane kii jimmedaari nibhaai thi
 BJP President Amit Shah himself had met many celebrities like former Army Chief Dalbir Singh Suhag, former Lok Sabha Secretary General Subhash Kashyap, industrialist Ratan Tata, actress Madhuri Dixit, Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 vahiin, congress sahit sapa, basapa, ensipi, tiemasi jaise vipakshi dal abhi tak chunavi ran main nahin utre hai
 Not only this, the Opposition is talking of unity against Modi, but till now the picture of the alliance of other states except Bihar and Maharashtra has not been clear
 congress ko haal hi main mili teen rajyon kii jeet se logon ko sambhaavnaaen dikhne lagi hai, lekin rahul gandhi siyaasi ran main kab utrenge
 No announcement has been made by the party about this yet
 congress abhi tak modi ke khilaaf rafel deal ke sivaa koi or mudde par unhen gherti hui nahin dikh rahi he
 Whereas BJP had prepared the blueprint of PM Modi's rallies during the elections of five states
 bijepi kii loksabhaa chunaav taiyaariyon ko lekar sapa sangrakshak mulaayam singh ko kahana padaa ki sapa abhi tak taiyaariyon main kaaphi peeche chal rahi he
 Whereas BJP is ahead of all parties

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ( Lok Sabha Election 2019) ke maddenjar upi kii siyasat main sapa-basapa gathbandhan se manachaaha seat paane kii rashtriya lokdal ichha dam tod chuki he
 The RLD, which wanted to get the seat it wanted till the end, finally had to settle for just three seats in the SP-BSP alliance
 rashtriya lokdal loksabhaa chunaav main basapa-sapa gathbandhan se chaar se paanch seat chaahati thi, magar mayawati or akhilesh yadav ke gathbandhan main uski yah muraad puri nahin ho pai or ab vah mahaj teen siton par hi apane ummidavaar utaar sakati he
 Actually, RLD got three seats after the SP-BSP alliance split the seats for the Lok Sabha elections, while SP will contest 37 and BSP 38 seats
 rashtriya lokdal ko pashchimi upi kii mathura, mujffarnagar or bagpat seat mili he, jahaan se areldi ke teen ummidavaar apni kistam aajamaa sakate hai
 It is expected that Ajit Singh from Muzaffarnagar and Jayant Chaudhary from Baghpat may contest
 haalanki, mathura se koun hoga areldi kaa ummidavaar ab tak iske koi sanket nahin hai
 In the alliance between the SP and the BSP, the RLD was trying to get at least five seats from the beginning
 shuru main areldi ne sapa-basapa gathbandhan se 5 siton kii maang kii thi, jabaki sapa-basapa gathbandhan shuru se hi areldi ko teen siten dene ko taiyaar tha
 The RLD had demanded these five seats - Hathras, Kairana, Baghpat, Muzaffarnagar and Kairana
 haalanki, use mahaj teen siton par hi santosh karnaa padaa
 On Tuesday, Akhilesh Yadav also commented on the ally RLD
 unhone kaha ki ham areldi ko is chunaav main teen seat de rahe hai
 After this announcement, RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary said that RLD will contest in three Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh
 unhone kaha ki RLD uttar pradesh main BSP-SP gathbandhan main shaamil hogi
 Our workers will work tirelessly to ensure the victory of the coalition in every seat of the state
 raajnneetik galiyaaron main charchaa yah bhi rahi ki shuru main to akhilesh yadav apane cote se areldi ko kuch or siten dene ko taiyaar bhi the, magar mayawati apane faisle par adig thim
 When there was such a wind that the RLD might split if it did not get the seats it wanted in the SP-BSP alliance, Akhilesh Yadav also asked for some seats from his quota
 magar phir baad main yah saaf ho gaya ki sapa or basapa main se koi bhi areldi ko teen se zyada siten nahin degi
 But in this political game of three-five, Jayant Singh and Ajit Singh did not win the game and they had to satisfy only three seats in the BSP-SP alliance
 haalanki, chaar se paanch siton ke liye areldi ne har sambhav koshish kii
 For this, Jayant Singh also talked to Akhilesh Yadav many times
 magar kisi tarah kii koi kamyaabi haath nahin lagi
 Please tell that Mayawati's party BSP and Akhilesh Yadav's party SP will field their candidates in equal number of seats

 Efforts are being made to reduce the rights
 yah thik nahin he
 i have written a letter to the Chief Minister regarding this
 aise chalate rahaa to pad par bane rahane kaa kya matlab? Minister of State for Revenue Sanjay Rathod has added the voice of Assistant Minister of State Vaikar
 rathod apane istife kii baat ko lekar shivasena party pramukh uddhav thakare se bhi mili
 However, he was asked to hold on
 maharashtra sarkaar main shivasena ke kul 10 mantri hai, jin main se paanch rajya mantri hai
 While five BJP ministers of state are working under the Shiv Sena cabinet ministers
 isi dhaage ko pakadakar maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya ki, bijepi ke kisi rajyamantri ne to kabhi shivasena ke siniar mantri ke khilaaf shikaayat nahin kii
 What work should be given to the ministers of state is known in the law and the work has been divided accordingly
 kisi ko yah lag saktaa he ki vah or adhik kaam karne ke liye sakasham hai
 But to do so, the law will have to be amended
 mukhyamantri ke maamle ko baatcheet se hal karne ke mood ke baavjood rajasav rajyamantri ekanath khadse apane par hue aaropon kaa jawaab palatwaar se dete hue dikh rahe hai
 Khadse issued a statement saying that the ministers of state should not insist on specific work
 is bayaanbaji ke baad maharashtra kii bijepi-shivasena sarkaar ke bich kaa yah vivaad thamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa he

 bijepi kaa daawa he ki ye apane aap main sabase bada video conferencing kaa kaarykram he
 The event will be attended by the Chief Minister and other big leaders of bjp-ruled states, including BJP President Amit Shah
 puri khabar padhein
 
 PM modi 15000 jagahon se bijepi ke 1 karod booth workars ko denge jeet kaa mantra Why is it that Doordarshan's name always comes up for the wrong reasons? Doordarshan, the country's leading TV news broadcaster, is continuously losing its place
 lekin ise phir se apni puraani jagah par sthapit karne ke liye kabhi koi prayaas nahin hua
 Ministers come and go after Khanapurti
 kehane ko yah swytt sanstha he lekin iske kaamkaaj ko dekhakar to nahin lagata ki yah vaaki swatantra he yaa is par sarkari tantra haaavee nahin he
 But even more sad than that is that its level has been falling continuously
 assi ke dashak main isane jo khyaati arjeet kii thi, vah na jane kab khatm ho gai
 Looking at its broadcast quality, it does not seem that it is a national channel
 na to samaacharon main nayaapan or na hi kaaryakramon main taazgi
 Doordarshan seems to be completing a formality
 yaa kuch khaas logon ke hit saadh rahaa he yah santhaan
 The latest case is the interview of bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi
 56 minute ke is intervyuu kaa ek tihaai hissaa hi uda diya gaya or usase bhi badi baat yah rahi ki modi dwaara priyanka gandhi yaa ahamed patel ke prati kahi gai sadbhaavna kii baaten bhi isamen se nikaal di gayi
 If time was lacking then some other parts could be removed
 aaj jabaki sabhi partiyon main jabardast vaimnasy dikhaai de rahaa he or sabhi ek duusare ke khilaaf ugr shabdon kaa istemaal kar rahe hai, aise main ye vinamr bol maahaul ko behatar banaate
 It is difficult to understand what the officials of Doordarshan want to prove by editing them
 phir jab itnaa bada intervyuu prasaarit ho rahaa ho to uske bare main janata ko koi soochna na dena to ek aparaadh jaisaa he
 Every TV channel keeps showing promos, teasers, etc
 of its big programs
 yah aam baat he lekin doordarshan ne jis chupe-dhanke andaaj main iskaa prasaaran kiya vah vaaki hairaan karata he
 This was a crappy way of Khanapuri
 doordarshan ke adhikari yah bhul jate hai ki yah sanstha janata ke paise se hi chalati he or isliye janata ke prati unki javabdehi bhi banati he
 The government has also made a strange policy
 ek taraf to vah prasar bharti ko swytt sanstha ghoshit kar chuki he to duusari ore isamen iees jaise adhikari shashan karne ke liye hai
 People who have no relation with broadcast or news
 vah vahaan mahatvapurn padon par baithe hue hai
 The administration of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting runs from behind the scenes
 swaittata kaa yahaan naamo nishaan nahin dikhataa he
 Now a new government will be formed, can we hope that its autonomy will be restored again and a fair and professional Doordarshan will be given a new look in front of us? We are saying this because during the elections, things are magnified but nothing happens later
 neshnal green tribunel ne mangalvaar ko ek cese kii sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha ki green court main aane vaale kareeb 50 fisadi maamle blackmailer dwaara court main file kiye ja rahe hai

 engiti ne ye tippanee vrundavan main ban rahe isckon mandir ke nirmaan par sawaal uthaati ek yachika kii sunwaayee ke dauraan kii
 Actually, the lawyer appearing for ISKCON in this case told the court that most of the petitions are being filed on behalf of those people
 jo court main arji lagane ke baad pakshakaron ko blackmel karte hai
 The court agreed, saying, "we know that about 50% of the petitions here are for blackmail
" court ne kaha ki isiilie ab ham sabhi yachikaaon par notice nahin karte hai
 Rather, we hear further on the petitions in which we see serious environmental problems
 'darasal, vrundavan ke hi ek vyakti ne engiti main yachika lagaai thi kii isckon mandir kaa nirmaan yamuna ke paas ho rahaa he or isse vahaan ke iklogical system ko bada khatra ho saktaa he
 The petition said that NOC has not been taken from different departments to build this temple
 lekin court ne sunwaayee ke dauraan paaya ki vrundavan main ban rahe chandroday mandir ke liye sabhi jagah se enosi lee ja chuki he
 This temple, being built at a cost of about 300 crores, is being built 700 feet tall which will be the tallest in the world in terms of religious monument
 is mandir main 70 floor banaae jaaenge
 The NGT has disposed of around 80 petitions during the last 3 weeks

 " jaisaa bhi banaaya jaataa he
 Shujaat Khan said, earlier songs had a different intoxication

 Every kind of music is in the world

 a fire broke out on Saturday in Trump Tower, New York, killing one person and injuring four people
 media reporton ke mutabik america samyaanusaar trump tower kii 50veen manzil par shanivaar shaam 6 baje aag lagi
 Fire brigade immediately rushed to the scene and the fire was controlled
 isse pehle janvari main bhi is imaarat main aag lagi thi, jisamen koi ghayal nahin hua tha
 Please tell that this Trump Tower belongs to US President Donald Trump
 ghatana ke samay us imaarat main trump parivaar kaa koi sadsy maujuud nahin thi
 All the business of President Trump, who is a businessman, operates from this trump tower and his family also lives in this building
 trump tower' america raashtrapati donald trump kaa doosraa ghar he
 His official residence is the 'white House'
 haalanki america karashtrapatichune jane ke baad se trump ne yahaan bahut kam samay guzaara he
 On successful handling of the fire, President Trump has tweeted and thanked the fire personnel and those who reported the incident
 Fire at Trump Tower is out
 Very confined (well built building)
 Firemen (and women) did a great job
 THANK YOU! - Donald j Trump (@realdonaldtrump)april 7, 2018samachar agency associat press ke mutabaki ek afasar ne bataaya ki melania trump or baron trump abhi washington disi main hai
 According to the US Department of Fire, the fire is in the part of the building that is meant for people to live
 soshal media par ai tasveeron main saaf dekha ja saktaa he ki aag kii lapten trump tower kii 50veen manzil se baahar aa rahi hai
 It is being said that one person was killed in this incident
 gandhi kii buniyadi talim main shikshak or chaatro ke bich keval kitaaben nahin hai
 There is also a part in it, which connects children with the truth of their lives
 is hisse ko hamaare paathyakram se yah jaanate hue bhi gaayab kar diya gaya ki yah gandhi kaa akelaa moulik avishkaar he, baaki sab ke bare main vah kehete the ki vah to unhone samaaj se hi liya he
 Basic training seems to be a thing of the past in this era, because it emphasizes labor
 kheti, kisaani, saaf-safai, khaanaa banane, silaai, kadhai, chitrakaari or bahut sari gatividhiyon par jor diya gaya he, ab ye kaam yadi schuli paathyakram main shaamil kar liye jaaen, to akhbaar yaa tivi channel kii khabar banate der nahin lagegi
 Sevagram was seen as a lively form of basic education written in Gandhi's books
 vahi sewagram, jahaan mahatma ne sabarmati ashram chhodkar kutiyaa banaai
 This Bapu hut, Adi Niwas and Adi Niwas, which has been made of mud for almost 80 years, is still in the same condition, while the feet of about seven lakh people weigh here every year
 isi parisar main nai talim kaa hissaa bhi he, jahaan gandhi kii buniyadi shiksha kii soch ne aakaar liya tha
 In the country when labor has been put in the category of crime after the radical change in education, the Anand Niketan school is giving ground to this dream of Gandhi
 pichley dinon is skool main janaa hua
 The first lesson is cleanliness
 shaala ke baahar ek board laga he
 Classroom cleaning responsibilities are written on the black board
 iske liye bacchon ke samooh hai
 Each group has a beautiful name, Mogra, Sadafuli, Kamal, Jasmine, Madhumalati, Parijat, Shevanti, Gulab
 saath main ek-ek prabharee shikshak kaa naam bhi
 From the bicycle stand to the classroom
 har ek kii jimmedaari bachche bakhubi nibhaa rahe hai
 But should this be possible in other schools, or what is the importance of cleaning in and around life, at what age should it be learned
 kya yah hamaare samaaj ke liye vicitra sthiti nahin he ki saaf-safai ke sahaj paath hamaare paathyakram se chin liye gaye or phir hamen isi paath ko padhaane ke liye tamaam tarah ke abhiyaan chalaane pade! shaharon main pratiyogitaayen karaani padin or number ek or number do banane pade
 Seeing the children cleaning, working in their fields, we remembered our school days, when we too used to make our school beautiful in the same sense
 alabatta aisa isliye tha, kyonki kaksha ek se aath tak ke hamaare skool main koi chaparasi nahin tha
 If we wish, it can also be called the name of atrocities on children, but every Saturday, in turn the class of bringing cow dung, fetching water and plowing from the village continued to teach us to love our class
 yahaan tak ki middle kakshaon tak aane main ham sahpaathiyon ne tay karke babul kii jhaadiyon se baagad tak kar daali, taaki paudhe lagaae ja saken
 Yes, it was sure that there was no discrimination
 isamen kabhi jati-birdari kii bandishen nahin ain, to phir vikaas ke saath jindagi ke yah paath kaise itane kathin hote gaye
 
 
 The Where did the walls of discrimination come from
 
 
 ? kya in deevaaron ko giraane kii shuruyaat bachapan se nahin ho jaani chahie
 
 
 ? This work is not so simple
 khaskar is daur main, jab chote-chote vishyon par bhi bakheda khadaa hone main der nahin lagati
 This is the concern of Tai Sushma Sharma, the director of this school
 2005 se is nai talim aadhaarit skool ko sanbhaalane vaali tai kii chintaa he ki yah behad samvedansheel vishay he, lekin jaruri he
 Not only the issue of cleanliness, farming is also taught
 gandhi kii chintaa bhi yahi thi ki schuli shiksha gaanv aadhaarit nahin he
 He does not have a vision of the village
 drushti to shahar kii bhi nahin he
 In such a situation, the Anand Niketan school is a Nazir, which connects the children around them, there is a field in every classroom, there are different kinds of seeds in the farm, the children are planting them by hand, they worry about planting less water By connecting water and saving the environment, there is no need to make awareness by running a separate campaign or teaching it
 skool ke har bachche kaa ek peti charkha he, ek kaksha soot se dhaagaa banane kii bhi he
 Younger children don't know why they are doing this, just reading the lesson of labor, it is not necessary to know its principle before every task, if we teach more lessons of behavior than theory, maybe Our school education would not have been so bad, schools would have been made by humans too
 isi skool se kuch kimi dur wardha shahar main gandhi gyaan mandir-bajaj science centre he, jahaan takreeban paanch sau bachche har saal vyaavhaarik shiksha kaa paath padhate hai
 Nikhil of class 10 has come here from around 70 kilometers away
 aane-jane main takreeban paanch ghante kaa samay lag jaataa he, phir bhi unhen yahaan aana isliye acha lagata he, kyonki kitabon ke saath prayog karne, khud karke seekhney, or khel-khel main seekhney ko miltaa he
 There is no fear there
 har kaksha main prayogshaala he
 Are we investing so much on our basic education, should such experiments not be extended further? aakhir kyon anand niketan yaa science centre jaise prayog, prayog hi kehalaate rahen, mukhyadhara nahin
 
 
 ! actor shreyas talapade philhal bollywood main bahut zyada active nahin hai, lekin ve anachaahe kaarnon se vivaadon main rahete hai
 Actually, actor Shreyas has recently told that someone is using his wife's name to commit fraud on social media
 shreyas ne aarope lagaaya ki jo shaks unki patni kaa istemaal kar rahaa he wo apane aapako amejon kaa casting head bataata he

 Deepti is an independent producer and has made some great films but she is not the casting director of Amazon

 Significantly, people are being fooled by using the name of Shreyas's wife Deepti
 reports ke athusaar, is frod shaks ne apane aapako soshal media par dipti bataaya he or wo logon se unke profile maang rahi he
 Talking about the workfront, Deepti has produced some Marathi films
 unki filmon main poster boij, baaji or sanai chaughade jaisi filmein shaamil hai

 lagaataar 48 ghante kii poochtacha ke baad bhi police anant singh se ye nahin ugalva pai ki unke paitruk ghar se mila eke-47 or 2 hand grenade kahaan se aae the

 police ne jab kuch puraane video dikhaaen jisamen wo eke-47 ke saath hai, to anant singh ne kah diya ki wo eke-47 plastic kii thi
 Recently, a video went viral in which two people are appearing with 2 ak-47s

 anant singh lagaataar aarope laga rahe hai ki unhen raajnneetik sajeesh ke tahat fansaaya gaya
 However, the way the police are working, it seems that there is a mess somewhere, otherwise the video of 2 AK-47 should go viral and the police should not even search the place where this video has been made

 ab sunne main aa rahaa he ki is biopic main sunil dutt ke kirdaar main big bi nazar aa sakate hai

 The film's director Rajkumar Hirani also agrees with the decision as he never worked with Sr
 Bachchan
 iske alaava hiraani ko lagata he ki sunil dutt jaisi shakhsiyat ko parde par big bi ke alaava or koi justiphi nahin kar paaegaa
 The biopic will depict Sanjay's straggles with drugs, mother's death, failed marriages, and perhaps his jail days

 During the match, the umpire was seen giving the changed ball to the team that was bowling continuously

 -input bhashaa se On Sunday, Team Anna indirectly targeted RJD chief Lalu Prasad, who had open differences with fellow workers of Anna Hazare
 anna ke anshan todane ke dauraan ramlila maidan main samarthakon ko sambodhit karte hue arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki samvidhan baba sahib bhimrao ambedkar ne banaaya
 He created the best constitution in the world, but if he had known that the leaders would eat the fodder and deposit the black money in Swiss banks, he would have probably made stricter provisions to deal with it
 gauratlab he ki bihar ke purv mukhyamantri or purv rail mantri lalu prasad chaara ghotaale main aaropee hai
 Lalu has sharp differences with the Hazare side
 hajaare paksh ne sansad ke monsoon satr se pehle lokapal ke mudde par apana rukh spasht karne ke liye raajnneetik dalon ke netaaon se samvaad karne ke tahat jab lalu se mulaakaat kii thi, tab bhi rajd pramukh ne unhen kai muddon par gherne kii koshish kii thi
 During the discussion on Lokpal in Lok Sabha on Saturday, Lalu also said that the government is not violating (parliamentary supremacy) by discussing the matter which is already with the standing committee? Lalu said that the matter is with the standing committee, whatever they have to say, say it there
 ramlila maidan main hajaare samarthakon ko sambodhit karte hue kejariwal ne ek baar yah bhi kaha tha ki lokapal vidheyak ko sthaayee samiti main nahin bheja janaa chahie, jisamen lalu prasad jaise sansad sadsy hon
 Significantly, Lalu is a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee for the Lokpal Bill
 upiessi kii pariksha main hindi madhyam ke chaatro kii safalataa kaa anupaat beete kuch varshon se lagaataar charchaa main he
 The result of the recent civil services examination has also disappointed the students who are preparing for the examination through Hindi medium
 haalat ye hai ki hindi madhyam se pariksha dene vaale parikshaarthi top-50 main bhi jagah nahin bana paa rahe hai
 However, this is not the first time and hence questions have started to be raised about Hindi itself along with the talent of Hindi Medium students
 sawaal yah he ki kya hindi madhyam ke chaatro main tallent kii kami hai? kya unki soch desh kisbase pratishthit sevake laayak nahin he? yaa phir jaisaa ki rigelt aane ke baad tamaam chaatr aarope laga rahe hai, kya vaaki hindi medium ke chaatro ke saath bhedbhaav kiya ja rahaa he? mukhya pariksha ke badale hue pattern kaa kya? inhen sawaalon kaa jawaab de rahe hai 2011 batch ke IFS (bhartiya videsh seva) tien kaushal, jo IFS kii naukari chhod in dinon hindi madhyam ke chaatro ko dilli ke mukherjee nagar main safalataa ke gur sikhaa rahe hai
 Question: Where do you see the Hindi medium in the civil services result of 2015? Answer: Certainly this result cannot be called good
 kisi bhi desh kaa bhavishya uski rashtrabhasha nishchit karti he or yadi us bhashaa ko bolne vaale log hi desh kii sarvocch seva main nahin honge to jaahir he ki bhavishya ke sanket achche nahin hai
 Question: Why has the success graph of students of Hindi belt suddenly fallen so much? What are the main reasons behind this? Answer: There are many reasons for this bad situation
 iske peeche mukhya kaaran india or bharat ke bich badhata gap he
 Hindi is still a much spoken language in India today than English
 lekin yah elite class kii bhashaa nahin he
 It is the language of the common people and the deprived of rural areas and small towns
 hindi madhyam ke abhyaarthee angreji madhyam ke abhyaarthee kii tulana main aarthik, saamaajik va shaikshanik teenon hi drushtiyon main pichde hai
 Here Hindi is not as much of English language as it is of distinction between poor and rich, village-city, government and convent school
 kul milakar yah muqabla gaiyr barabari kaa he to nattejey kaa anumaan aap laga hi sakate hai
 You see the result of the last several years
 zyaadaatar topper dilli jaise bade shaharon se hi nikal rahe hai or unki paariwarik, aarthik sthiti bhi kaaphi behatar he
 Question: Since 2013 UPSC exam pattern changed, do you consider it responsible for falling Hindi Medium's success graph? Answer: See one thing i want to make clear that the aspirants of Hindi medium will ever gain in the IAS exam
 Have not been in the situation
 ve hameshaa haashie par rahe hai
 The reason for the decrease in the success rate from the last 5 years is that the exam pattern has changed rapidly and the candidates of Hindi medium have failed to deal with this situation
 sawaal: aapako kya lagata he ki hindi medium ke chaatro ke liye mukhya pariksha kaa badla pattern tedi kheer ho gaya he?jawaab: haa, aap bilkul sahi hai
 The Hindi medium student is unable to adjust to the changing nature of the exam
 sawaal: upiessi kii pariksha ke liye hindi medium se chalane vaale koching santhaan is rigelt ke liye kitne jimmedaar hai?jawaab: koi bhi koching santhaan kisi vyakti kohiashnhin bana sakati he
 This is true for Hindi medium as much as for English medium
 antar yah he ki hindi madhyam ke adhikansh abhyaarthee yah nahin samaj pate or puri tarah se koching sansthaaon par nirbhar ho jate hai
 While most of the candidates in English medium do coaching, they keep updating their preparation from other sources as well
 yahaan par IIT aadi sansthaaon ke chaatr isliye behatar sthiti main rahete hai, kyonki unhen apane seniors kaa, jo ki civil seva ke liye chaynit ho chuke hai, kaa sahyog bhi mil jaataa he
 You see that even the largest coaching center of English medium Delhi, Karol Bagh, has a maximum of around 200 students in a batch
 lekin mukherjee nagar main hindi medium kii koching main ek batch main 700 se 800 chaatr tak pard rahe hai
 There can be discourse among so many students, not studies
 yah antar siddh karata he ki hindi madhyam main bhedchaal kii pravriti apekshaakrit zyada he
 Question: What strategy do you think Hindi Medium students should plan in order to succeed in the changed pattern? Answer: Hindi medium students only by changing their strategy with the time suited to Darwin's theory 'survival of fit' Can be successful in the exam
 aap kisi bhi topper kaa intervyuu dekhen ek baat aapako sab main kaaman milegi ki is pariksha main safalataa kaa koi shortkat nahin he
 Realizing your weaknesses, a solid plan of 2 to 3 years should be studied and studied
 agar aap civil services ke liye syrius hai to SSC, railway jaisi parikshaon kii ore bhatakana nahin chahie
 Question: You have done the exam in both the patterns during the preparation
 In practice, what is the difference between the two of you? Answer: The difference between the old pattern and the new pattern is that now the questions with rote answers are not asked in this exam
 ab adhyayan kii jagah chintan par aadhaarit prashn puche jate hai jiske sidhe uttar kitabon main nahin milte
 Question: You are IFS (indian Foreign Service) of 2011 batch and leaving job and teaching Hindi Medium students? What do you think are the problems with the students of Hindi medium? Answer: When i started teaching Hindi medium students after taking a break from service, the main problem was about CSAT
 lekin ab samasyaayein or jatil ho gai hai
 Therefore, i have accepted this challenge by designing a service
 mujhe lagata he hindi madhyam kii kai samasyaayein hai
 There is a lack of better guidance in the medium of English-educated students from institutions like IIT, IIM, AIIMS
 doosraa, hindi kaa chaatr zyaadaatar arts kaa chaatr hota he or hamaare vishvavidhyalayon main adhyayan or adhyaapan kaa dhang 25 se 30 saal peeche chal rahaa he
 As a result, a student studying in general universities finds himself dwarfed in front of a student from an institute like IIT
 arts waalon ke paas JNU jaisi univarsity he, lekin vah apane course angreji madhyam main sanchalit karti he
 To win a war, apart from morale, better weapons, better technology and better strategy are required
 safalataa duusare kii ranneeti kaa anusaran karke nahin apni khud kii behatar ranneeti taiyaar karke hi praapt kii ja sakati he
 So the main difference in my approach is that i have developed a strategy suited to the Hindi medium, instead of blinding the English medium strategy, which is designed keeping in mind both the weaknesses and strengths of the candidates of Hindi
 main apane chaatro ko 3 phej main upiessi kii taiyaari karvaa rahaa hum
 My focus in the first phase is to address the shortcomings of their schooling
 duusare phej main internet, utyub jaisi takneekee ke prayog dwaara unhen IIT jaisi sansthaaon ke chaatro se mukaable main sakasham banane par jor he or tisare phej main bas jeet kii bhaavana ke vikaas par jor he, kyonki haare hue man se ladaai nahin jiti ja sakati he
 Question: After the 2015 result, a message is being circulated on social media that if you want to become an IAS, then study in English medium? Do you think the commission is discriminating against the Hindi medium? Answer: This is a new issue to distract the students of the Hindi medium
 main kai aise chaatro ko jaanata hum jo hindi madhyam ko chhodkar angreji madhyam main gaye or parinaam pehle se bhi zyada kharaab rahaa
 The reduction is not in the medium but in the strategy
 sawaal: nae pattern main hindi medium ke chaatr padhai kii ranneeti main kya badlaav karen?jawaab: andhanurkan or shortkat kii pravriti se bachein
 Make a comprehensive study strategy and read standard books
 abhyaarthiyon ko ranneeti tristareey banani hogi
 1) In the first phase, overcome your weaknesses
 NCERT jaisi maanak pustakon ko padhakar apni schuli shiksha kii kamiyon ko dur karen
 2) In the second stage, use the textual content like IGNOU against the students of institutions like IIT
 is charan main internet jaisi nai takneekon kaa bhi prayog karen
 3) Use the library in the third step and develop your writing style
 bataa den ki tien kaushal ne kanpur dehaat ke navoday skool se schuli shiksha praapt kii he
 He is a graduate from Allahabad University and a post graduate in Hindi literature from JNU
 hindi sahitya main jearef tien kaushal 2005 main upipiessi exam paas karke tregeri afasar ke liye chune gaye
 In 2006, he became Deputy Collector in UP
 2010 main upiessi kaa exam paas karke assistant inakam tex kamishnar (IRS) bane or phir 2011 main bhartiya videsh seva ke liye chune gaye
 But Kaushal quit his job after training
 notebandi or jiesti ke asar se desh kii iconomi dhire-dhire ubarne lagi he
 In such a situation, the GDP figures for the october-december quarter coming on Wednesday can bring good news for the Modi government
 ummid jataai ja rahi he ki is dauraan jidipi kii vruddhi dar 6
 May remain 9 percent
 agar aisa hota he, to is maamle main bharat china se aage nikal saktaa he
 In the last week itself, the poll has predicted that India's GDP growth between October and December quarter is 6
 9 fisadi rah sakati he
 Which is estimated in the Reuters poll, if the figures come the same way then India will overtake China
 isaki madad se bharat duniya kii sabase teji se badhane vaali iconomi ban jaaegi
 GDP figures around 5 on Wednesday evening
 30 baje jari ho sakate hai
 Explain that the pace of China's GDP in the october-december quarter is 6
 8 fisadi rahi thi
 Earlier in 2016 there was a sharp increase in India's GDP
 yah 2016 ke aakhri teen maheenon ke dauraan se teji se badi thi
 GDP growth rate 6 in the second quarter (july-september) of FY 2017-18
 3 fisadi rahaa
 These figures of GDP brought relief to the Central Government, because the GDP growth rate in the first quarter of the current financial year is 5
 7 fisadi thi
 In the first quarter, the growth rate reached a 13-quarter low and was attributed by economic experts to a major economic reversal in November 2016, including demonetisation
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke vijay rath ko rokane ke liye chah dal ek saath aa gaye hai
 JDU president Sharad Yadav announced the formation of a new party by combining these parties
 mulaayam singh yadav kii samaajawaadee party, nitish kumaar kii janata dal united, lalu yadav kii rashtriya janata dal, purv pradhanmantri echdi devegoda kii janata dal secular, om prakaash chautaala kii ieneldi or camel morarka kii samaajawaadee janata party milakar ek nayaa dal ban jaaenge
 Sharad Yadav said - There is no guarantee of stability
 The merger was announced on Wednesday after a long meeting at Mulayam Singh Yadav's house
 sharad yadav ne kaha, 'sapa, jediu, argedy, jedies, ieneldi or sajapa kaa aapas main vilay hoga
 In the meeting held today, it has been decided to constitute a new team
 nae dal ke adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav honge
 He will also be the chairman of the party's parliamentary board
 'kahani janata parivaar ke bikharaav bhare ateet kinam, jhanda or chunaav chinh abhi tay nahinapako bataa den ki party ke naam, jhanda, chunaav chinh par abhi koi faisla nahin hua he
 a committee has been formed for this, comprising HD Deve Gowda, Lalu Yadav, Om Prakash Chautala, Sharad Yadav, Ram Gopal Yadav and Kamal Morarka
 yah kamity vilay prakriya or nai party kii ranneeti kaa khaakaa-chittha tay karegi
 Challenging Modi government is our objective: Lalu Yadav Laloo Yadav said that the purpose of this merger is to challenge the BJP government at the Center
 unhone kaha, 'ham log puure desh kaa daura karke janata tak sandesh pahunchaayenge
 We will oust the BJP from power by doing politics of socialism and this is our policy
 bihar pehla jang kaa maidan hoga
 'janata Parivar will not stop BJP: Shahnawaz Hussain bjp's reaction to this merger has also come
 bijepi netaa shahanvaj hossain ne kaha, 'ye janata parivaar kaa jo vilay hua he
 This is done keeping Bihar in mind
 ye log dare hue hai
 They feel that the BJP can be stopped if found
 par aisa hona nahin he
 There is more controversy among them
 vilay kii baat to kar di par na jhanda tay hua na hi chunaav chinh
 RJD-JDU is eyeing the biggest political benefit of the Rashtriya Janata Dal and Janata Dal United in the Bihar elections
 ab tak chunaav main donon hi partiyon aapas main bhidati raheen, kai baar ek duusare ke vot bank ko nuksaan bhi pahunchaaya
 With the merger, the votebank of both parties is expected to come together
 aankadon ke lihaaj se dekhen to pichley vidhansabha chunaav main argedy ko 18
 84 percent votes were received while JDU 22
 58 fisadi vot ke saath rajya main sabase badi party bani thi
 In such a situation, BJP and Narendra Modi will now face a strong challenge in the state
 or bijepi vidhansabha chunaav main haar jaati he to iskaa asar uttar pradesh chunaavon main bhi dikhegaa
 The new Janata Parivar has a total of 15 seats in the Lok Sabha
 (kul sadsy - 543, endie- 336, upie - 56)espi-5argedy-4jedy(you)- 2jedy(es)- 2aeneldi- 2nai party ko rajyasabha main kul 40 sadsy hai
 (total members- 250, NDA- 57, UPA- 80) SP- 15 JD (U) - 12 RJD- 1 JD (S) - 1 INLD- 1 Janata Parivar will get the prize of the national party? The new party has a total of 15 mps in the Lok Sabha and the national 7 of the vote
 06 fisadi
 These figures show that the Janata Parivar will get the status of a national party
 maujuuda kanoon ke mutabik koi bhi raajnneetik party jo janata ke sadan yani loksabhaa ke kul siton kaa 2 pratishat jeetne main kaamyaab rahe or uske sadsy kam se kam teen alag rajyon se chunakar aae hon, aisi sthiti main is party ko rashtriya party kii manyata di jaaegi
 Technically, the new party would be considered a national party
 haalanki, is par faisla chunaav ayog ko karnaa hoga kyonki yah vilay chunaav ke pehle nahin, iske baad ho rahaa he

 maut kaa khauf pal-pal bagdadi kaa peechha kar rahaa he, mosul main ek lakh phogiyon se ghirakar bagdadi philhal kaanp rahaa he
 To hide this fear, he has issued an audio tape and said that he will fight the terrorists till the last moment
 do saal se zyada samay seiss ke aatanki sargandbu bakar al bagdadi ne iraq ke mosul shahar ko apni rajdhani bana rakhaa tha
 While sitting there, he used to fire terror in entire Gulf countries
 lekin aaj uske ghar main iraqi sena ke hamalon kii aag lagi hui he
 Baghdadi is so engrossed in it that if news of his death comes soon, you would not be surprised
 iraqi sena napehle mosul ke aasapaas ke gaanvon ko iesas ke aatank se mukt karaayaa or ab mosul ko bagdadi se mukt karaane ke aakhri mode par he
 Kurdish fighters are also fighting the last battle with the Iraqi army against Baghdadi

 All his activities have been confined to Mosul and its adjacent city of Afar, and today Baghdadi is surrounded in the same Mosul
 mosul main ghusane se pehle iraqi sena ne ramaadi, tirakit or fajullah jaise shaharon main aies kaa safaya kar diya
 At the same time, in cities like Qarakosh, Hamam Al Alil, Khajer, Kuwair and Tal Afar, the watches of Baghdadi are counting

 In such a situation, frustrated with his life without reading the paper, the farmer hangs himself, as the paper was a letter sent to the National Lok Adalat for settlement
 darasal, mahoba kachhari main 12 april ko rashtriya lok adaalat ke jariye kisaanon va anya logon ke vaadon kaa nistaaran kiya janaa he

 saal 2011 main aabaad ne bhartiya state bank mahoba se kheti ke liye 20 hajaar rupee karj liye the, jise vah ab tak nahin chukaa paaya tha
 It is said that Abad took money from the bank to get him boring
 usne boring karvaa bhi di thi
 This led to good yield every year

 Now he had to pay about 15 thousand rupees with interest

 In this era of globalization, it is often heard that national identities are being erased
 bade paimaane par sahaj or nirantar avaagaman se rashtriya paribhaashaayen puraani padati ja rahi hai
 This is very correct about me
 meraa janm soviet sangh main hua, paalan-poshan zyaadaatar england hi nahin, germany or scotland main bhi hua
 For a decade i have been working in Prague and Moscow
 meraa zyaadaatar parivaar america main rahata he, meri shaadi ek roosi se hui he or mere bacchon ke paas daanton se zyada passport hai
 So when it comes to the World Cup, the great festival of national identities, i get confused
 footbal kaa junun mere sir par savaar rahata he
 But in whose favor should i acclimate, in whom do i get excited? i have spent 65 per cent of my life in England (to be fair, in London, which is not England in the true sense)
 meraa dil kahata he 'england kaa samarthan karo' or main uski team ko kaaphi kareeb se jaanata bhi hum
 i am also so British that the nostrils begin to swell at the failure of England
 lekin main itnaa angrej bhi hum, jo yah jaan jaae ki pehali peedi kaa pravasi aisa sachcha angrej nahin ho saktaa ki desh ke sarokaar uske sir chadhakar bolen
 You can probably feel it in America
 yahaan to yah kuch ajeeb lagata he
 It takes three generations to become a true Englishman
 pehali peedi to ''roosi / polandwasi'' vagairah ho sakati he, duusari peedi ''rus / poland vagairah mul ke'', or teesri peedi sirf angrej ho sakati he
 That famous 'cricket question' of the Tory legend Norman Tebbit is a baffle that tests the loyalty of an immigrant to whether his heart beats England for cricket
 koi ekadam nayaa aane vaala hi england ke prati apana ruzan dikhayega jo angrejiyat se rou-ba-rou na ho
 It is different in Germany, where my teenage years have passed
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke kai dashakon baad tak footbal hi aisi cheez thi jisamen germany ke log garv se apni deshbhakti kaa izhaar kar pate the
 i was blushing to my friends, who may not have been ashamed of their grandparents' actions during World War II, openly celebrating their victorious team in the 1990 World Cup, when their Arya sentiment was like a machine
 Lothar Matthews used to play cleanly
 pashchim germany kii footbal team kaa udai sheet yuddh kii samaapti ke saath desh kii aarthik kamyaabiyon ke saath hi hua
 In the decades following the reunification of Germany, the team looked somewhat nervous, as if the unified Germany team were shaking the world with massive success
 ab nai team kaa udai hua, jisamen gaiyr-german naamon kii bharmaar he—masalan, ojil, khedira, podolski, gomage, close vagairah
 This team plays attractive, drifting football like a stream
 ve haarate bhi hai to apane kushal pairon kii vajah se kabhi nahin
 This new team has made a new, globalized German nationality acceptable to the people of Germany and new immigrants from Germany are also feeling like a part of this nationality
 is rashtriya team kii nai bahusaanskrithik prakruti kii vidambnaa yah he ki aam taur par germany bahusamskritwad ko khaarij karata rahaa he, yahaan tak ki angela mercel bhi pravaasiyon ko german rang-dhang main dhalane par jor de rahi hai
 Until 1999 citizenship was limited to blood relations
 saarvajanik nitiyon ke maamle main bahusaanskrithik england main zyada sweekaaryata he
 But when it comes to football, Germany becomes a more open country
 main sochataa hum ki germany ke log unki team ke liye meri deewangi kaa swaagat karenge
 However, i have not yet imagined to do so
 germany main main ek 'europea skool' main gaya
 It is one of the special institutions created through the founding of the European Union to nurture a new kind of nationality
 europea sangh ke sutaradhar jyaan monet ke mutabik, europea skulon ke chaatr ''man se europea honge or ekikrut pragatisheel europe ko saakaar karne ko taiyaar honge
 "many of these students were sons and daughters of EU leaders, bureaucrats and other journalists, like me
" skool vibhinn bhashaaon ke virgon main banta tha, angerji, german, francisi, dach vagairah
 We used to teach basic courses in one language and history and geography in a foreign language
 is prayog ke kai achche pahalu the
 Everyone in the school knew at least three languages
 lekin asmita kii raajnneeti ke aage yah prayog naakaam ho gaya
 Students drowned in excesses towards their countries instead of being 'european by heart'
 unka deshprem aise betuke str par pahunch gaya jiske darshan khaskar vishwa cap main hote hai
 i remember Gustavo, that fat boy who was so eager to prove his Italian origin that he refused to speak in another language
 gustao kabhi italy main nahin rahaa
 He grew up in Brussels and Frankfurt
 europe ne use jindagi kaa vah ehsaas nahin diya
 But that feeling of clan-national origin is difficult for me
 meraa janm aise desh main hua, jo ab nakshe se gaayab he
 It has always been a dilemma for me to fill the birthplace mines in formal forms: i have been writing the Soviet Union but now it is not in the list of names of countries on the Internet
 isliye main ab ukraine likhata he: meraa janm kiv main hua tha
 But at no time of age did i wake up to be a Ukrainian
 mujhe english skool main 'roosi' kahkar chidhaayaa jaataa tha
 i have been called anglo-russian in public places
 jab maine apane mul ko pahchaanane kii koshish kii, main moscow main rahaa
 i was there when the Russian football team got up
 euro 2008 main arshavin kii prerana se team adbhut paas ke jariye semifinal tak pahunch gai
 Many good things happened about Russia in Euro 2008
 tabhi raashtrapati dimitri medavdev ne pashchimonmukh udaar sudhaaron kii ore kadam badhaayaa
 For the first time, the Russian team got a foreign coach in the form of Gus Hindik
 unki niyukti kaa rashtravaadiyon ne baari virodh kiya lekin kamyaabi ne dikhaa diya ki rus europea raah par chalakar kaamyaab ho saktaa he
 i was relieved to see my Russian friends beating Holland, celebrating the Russians carrying flags on Moscow's Stalin Avenue, running on the gleaming Mercedes at night
 tab se vladimir putin ne apane dakshinpanthi rashtravaadi rajnatik agenda ke jariye us kamyaabi ko chura liya
 Now once again the coach of the Russian team is Fabio Kapello but he is the only symbolic European to get the Kremlin money
 unamem naitik damakham nahin
 This year, Russia acquired Crimea and started a proxy war in Eucraim, for the first time i realized the feelings of being Ukrainians
 main aadhi raat ko is ehsaas ke saath jaag uthaa ki mere dada odesa ke the, meri maa or unka parivaar kiv kaa tha, mere pita jarnovitj ke the—or ye sabhi jagahen ab tanks se tharra rahi hai
 Suddenly, it became clear that despite all the dreams of globalization, nationalism is the most important thing: it is the only border where every person's freedom is safe
 to, main is vishwa cap main ukraine ko samarthan karata
 The problem is that the team did not qualify
 yaa shaayad yah samasya se adhik raahat kii baat he
 Now England and Russia are also out so i can enjoy football in peace
