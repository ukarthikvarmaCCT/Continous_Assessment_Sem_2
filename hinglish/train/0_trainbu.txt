 Like a respected politician, he said that he was covering the pages of the magazine
 usee dauraan ye tasviir lee gai he

 ' iske baad ve likhte hai, 'blessa par chhapi report padhane ke liye maine seshan ke dauraan intervyuu (megsine) maangi thi or gajab he, ye tasviir neshnal news ban gai

 Smith was not happy with his batting as he was able to score 4 runs against PAK
 Australia's legendary batsman Steve Smith could not do much in the first Test match against Pakistan
 australia ne pehle hi yah match jitkar siries main 1-0 kii badhat bana lee ho, lekin smith apane vyaktigat pradarshan se khush nahin hai
 Smith was able to score only four runs in the first innings of the first Test
 apane is pradarshan se naakhush hokar smith ne khud ko ek anokhi sajaa di he
 As a punishment for his poor performance, he walked a distance of about three kilometers from the stadium in Brisbane to the team's hotel
 yani unhone stadium se hotel pahunchane ke liye team bas nahin lee or teen kilometre kii duuri tay kii
 What did Steve Smith think of Yasir Shah's 'seven times' celebration? 👀 @ alintaenergy | # ausvpakpic

 This match between the two teams will be day and night
 uttar pradesh ke bareli jile main shanivaar ko naaraaz kaaryakartaaon ne pilibhit se bhaajapa ke saansad varun gandhi ke kafile par juute-chappal phenke or kaale jhande dikhaaye
 According to sources, Varun had arrived to attend an event in Bareilly's Nawabganj tehsil, when some party workers reached there and started urging him to attend a pre-determined event but the MP refused, causing angry workers to wear shoes on Varun's convoy - Tossed slippers and waved black flags
 nawabganj nagar palika ke adhyaksh rabindra singh rathore ne bataaya ki unhone varun se vikaas kaaryo ke locarpan karaane kii taiyaari kii thi
 The program for the inauguration of Guru Gobind Singh Park and Nag Panchami Mela Chowk was decided with the consent of Varun, hence his name was also written on the rocks at the venue
 unhone bataaya ki varun nawabganj pahunche lekin purv nirdhaarit kaaryakramon main hissaa lene se inkaar kar diya
 This provoked activists and stopped the mp's convoy and threw shoes and slippers at him

 In the past, when PM Narendra Modi came to Lucknow, there was no appointment in that program, but Aparna reached there
 baad main yah charchaa kaa vishay ban gaya tha
 Aparnapratik Yadav and Aparna Yadav, who are native of Uttarakhand, were married on 4 December 2011

 Stress, anxiety, and depression in life haunt everyone
 sabhi aisi bhaawanaaon se dur rahanaa to chaahate hai lekin yah nahin jaanate ki iskaa tarika kya he
 By the way, a research has found an effective way to do this
 ek nae shodh ke anusaar, i-mail band rakhane or iskaa kam se kam istemaal karne se tanaav kaaphi had tak kam ho saktaa he
 This recent research has said that by doing this lifestyle is better
 isamen bataaya gaya he ki i-mail bhale ihi communication kaa ek behtareen madhyam he lekin iske bahut adhik istemaal se avsaad or tanaav badhata he
 In this survey conducted on about 2000 people, London Future Work Center has found that people who are constantly receiving e-mails are more likely to go through the pressure
 iske alaava adhyayan main bataaya gaya he ki i-mail jaanchate vakt raat or subah kaa samay bhi ucch dabaav or tanaav ke kaarnon se judaa he
 However, how much pressure you feel and how much you can bear depends on your personality
 is adhyayan ke mukhya lekhak richard mckinan ke anusaar, yah shodh darshata he ki i-mail dodhari talwaar he
 It is a unique way of communication but it also promotes depression, pressure and stress
 richard ke anusaar, pehle jo log ise upyogi bataate the, vahi aaj isse chhutkaaraa paanaa chaahate hai
 According to the study, the high pressure of e-mail causes managers to be two-four more than other employees
 richard ke anusaar, suvidhajanak hone kii vajah se hamane bhavatmak pratikriyaaon ko takanic ke madhyam se sanchaarit karne kii aadat viksit kar lee he lekin yahi suvidha hamaare swasthya ko prabhavit kar rahi he
 In this time of high-tech, technology has made inroads in everything
 aise main yahi takanic logon ke swasthya par haaavee bhi hoti ja rahi he
 Two years after the ban on demonetisation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has clarified the questions raised about it
 pradhanmantri modi ne notebandi ko jhatka maanane se inkaar karte hue kaha he ki hamane kaala dhan jamaa karne waalon ko ek saal pehle hi cheta diya tha ki agar unke paas avaidh rup se dhan jamaa he to ve jurmaana dekar use jamaa kar sakate hai or maafee paa sakate hai
 PM Modi said that we had already warned people
 lekin logon ko laga ki modi bhi duusare netaaon kii tarah hi hai isliye bahut kam log hi svaichhik rup se apane jamaa paison kaa khulaasa karne aage aae
 # pmtoanion Demonetization: This wasn't a jhatka
 We had warned people a year before, that if you have such wealth (black money),you can deposit it,pay penalties and you will be helped out
 However, they thought Modi too would behave like others so very few came forward voluntarilypic
 twitter
 com / ypwsggtv3g — ANI (@ANI) January 1, 2019 Modi said that it is true that they are called the first family of the country, whose four generations ran the country and who are on bail today due to financial irregularities
 ve or unki seva main lage log hi is tarah kii soochna failaane kii koshish kar rahe hai taaki notebandi ke khilaaf maahaul banaaya ja sake
 The Prime Minister was asked what was the benefit of demonetisation, Modi told his 5 benefits - 1 - The sacks which were kept in the house, came into the banking system
 2-notebandi ke baad ek eemaandaaree ai, nai peedi ke logon ko yah samaj main aayaa ki unhen eemaandaaree se kaam karnaa he
 His father's grandfather used to steal tax because there was the same kind of atmosphere in the country but now it is not so
 3-yah saaf dekha ja saktaa he ki notebandi ke baad se tex adaa karne waalon kii sankhya badi he
 4-people have a chance to work through the banking system
 5-jidipi kii tulana main karansi kam hoti ja rahi he, yah shubh sanket he
 There was a time when the ratio of currency was much higher than the GDP, if this kept going, then the problem of keeping currency would have come today
 gauratlab he ki 8 november 2016 ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne notebandi kaa elaan karte hue 500 or 1000 ke note bain kar die the
 These notes immediately went out of circulation and after that every section of the public had to struggle to replace the old notes
 kuch logon ko bank ke baahar lagi lambii line main jaan bhi ganvaani padi thi
 The opposition has been terming demonetisation as a big scam while the government claims that demonetisation was a surgical strike against black money
 ab khud piem ne daawa kiya he ki notebandi desh ke phaayde ke liye thi

 The first schedule of the film was shot in Delhi

 The Ministry of Home Affairs said that Mariam Kufi was shot dead by a security guard after the incident
 vah takad praant se saansad hai
 The ministry said that the police apprehended the suspect and she is investigating to find out the motive behind the attack
 mariyam kii bahan or saansad phojia kufi ne kaha ki unhen pataa nahin ki hamalaa kisne kiya he
 During the hearing of the 2-G case, the Supreme Court has made strict comments
 saath hi court ne is maamle ko alag se nipataane ke liye vishesh court banane kaa nirdesh diya he
 The court said during the hearing of the case that the CBI should also investigate the crime of the beneficiaries in this case
 court ne sibiai ko aadesh diya ki wo is maamle main sajeesh karne waalon ke naam bataae
 Also, the first chajersheet should be placed in front of it and then be submitted to the special court

 kya aapke saath bhi aisa hota he ki jahaan puri duniya party-sharty main dubi rahati he vahiin aap akelepan kaa majaa le rahe hote hai
 Despite reading with hundreds of people in school and college, you don't even have half a dozen friends, so don't worry
 aap kharaab na mahasoos karen
 The mistake in this is due to your intelligence
 darasal iskaa matlab he ki aapako aise log kam milte hai jinke sochane kaa level aapke baraabar ho
 Now confirming this, the British General of Psychology has released a new report
 is report main unhone kaha he ki budhimaan logon ke dost bhi chuninda hote hai
 This report says that more intelligent people are happier when they are not with anyone, and perhaps that is why their friends are also limited
 budhimaan log apane kaam or kaaryastylee ko lekar santusht nahin hote
 They are always on the path to doing better
 ye hui na baat! ab ye baat kahin aapako schuli dinon main pataa chal gai hoti to phir kya hi kehane hote
 
 
 Carroll Graham, who spoke through an article in The Washington Post, the world's most prestigious newspaper, says that it is no wonder people with more intelligence stay away from sociality
 aisa na karte hue ve apana keemtee samay bachaate hai or kisi gudh rahasy yaa vidha par kaam kar rahe hote hai
 Now when this thing is being said as the best scholar in the world, then he must be saying it correctly
 aise budhimaan log to ravivaar ko bhi chuttee nahin manaate
 This study also mentions how our forefathers started living together
 us daur main jeene ke liye saath rahanaa jaruri tha
 People used to roam around here and there in search of a partner
 aise main jaruri tha ki ve saath-saath rahen
 But in today's era, if someone wants to be alone, then there will be more reasons for it
 to isliye aap pareshaan na hon, yadi aap akele main rah kar apana blog likhnaa chaahate hai
 Want to read a book
 to aap khud ko or behatar banane ke liye prayaas jari rakh sakate hai
 The whole world will bow down to your success later

 In the name of making Narendra Modi the Prime Minister in Jaipur and winning all 25 seats, in the Target-25 Muslim Conference, the leader of the RSS, Indresh Kumar, had such a love for Muslims that he was seen giving a clean cheat to all the terrorist organizations of the country including Pakistan

 While addressing the Muslims in Modi's mission to make him Prime Minister, the rss's prominent leader Indresh Kumar even went on to say that in the riots since 2006, he is getting the hand of the Indian government instead of any Muslim or Pakistani organization like Lashkar
 musalamaanon ko khush karne ke liye indresh ne hedli or lashkar jaise aatanki sanghathan ko doshi bataane ke bajaae kaha ki bharat sarkaar inhen blem kar rahi he
 RSS leader Indresh Kumar said, 'you see this government caught hundreds of SIMI people who are still in jail in 2006-07 in the name of riots and some explosions

 On August 1, 2011, Bihar Governor Devanand Kunwar appointed Professor Shambhunath Singh, with a strong bio-data, as the Chancellor of Patna University
 us vakt singh indira gandhi mukt vishvavidhyalay ke patrakarita or new media studies vibhaag ke nideshak the
 According to the Open University website, Shambhunath Singh has 25 years of journalism experience and is known for his intellectual understanding and writing
 lekin may maah ke ant main bihar ke ucch shiksha vibhaag ke pramukh sachiv es
 Shiv Kumar wrote to the Chief Accountant General (audit), "as per Patna University Act, 1976, Shambhunath Singh does not have the necessary qualifications for appointment to the post of Vice Chancellor
 '' 1987 batch ke iees adhikari kumaar ne pramukh mahalekhaakaar ko yah khat tab likhaa jab lekhaakaaron ne paaya ki singh kii niyukti main vishvavidhyalay ke praavdhaanon kaa ulanghan kiya gaya he
 Under these provisions, to become the Chancellor of the university, it is necessary to have at least 6 years of experience of running a university as an educationist
 iske alaava isi praavdhaan ke mutabik, kisi vishvavidhyalay yaa mahavidhyalay main pradhanacharya yaa vibhaagadhyaksh pad par rahete hue 10 saal ke shikshan kaa anubhav vaale logon ko bhi kulapati pad ke yogya mana gaya he
 Now the Bihar government has reached the conclusion that Singh does not fulfill any of these two qualifications
 shiv kumaar ne 26 june ko india today se kaha, ''maine is masale par pramukh mahalekhaakaar ko sarkaar kii manshaa se avgat kara diya he
 We need chancellors who can inspire the students
 ''pramukh mahalekhaakaar bharat sarkaar ke niyantrak or mahalekha pareekshak ke adheen kaam karata he or rajya sarkaar ke har kharch or aamadani kaa hisaab rakhata he
 He wrote to Governor Kunwar, "the unqualified applicants" (singh) knew that they were not fulfilling the necessary qualifications
 iske baavjood unhone ''rajyapal ke sachivalay ke varisht afasaron ke saath mileebhagat'' karke niyukti hasil kar lee
 "the Chief Accountant's office has also asked the Principal Secretary to the Governor, why not post an objection book about the payment of his salary since Singh's appointment
" haalanki kulapati singh in sab tamaam likhat-padhat se ratti bhar bhi pareshaan nahin dikh rahe
 He told India Today on June 26, "I don't know why i am being made a sacrificial goat?" i fulfill all the qualifications to be appointed to the post of Vice Chancellor
 mere paas prashasan chalaane or padhaane kaa paryaapt anubhav he
 Those who are questioning my ability should at least ask me to see my full bio data
 ''singh kaa maananaa he ki patna vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati ke taur par unka kaamkaaj thikthak rahaa he
 He says, "patna University has become the only university in Bihar to implement a semester system
 iske alaava hamane apane chaatro or unke abhibhavakon ko paardarshita ke liye uttar pustika dikhaane kii vyavastha bhi kii he
 Kunwar appointed vice-chancellors in six universities of Bihar on August 1, 2011
 isko lekar kaaphi vivaad hua kyonki nitish kumaar kii sarkaar kii ore se kaha gaya ki in niyuktiyon main rajya sarkaar se koi mashvira nahin kiya gaya
 On the other hand, sources close to Raj Bhavan say that according to the Bihar University Act, the Governor has the right to appoint the vice-chancellor and vice-chancellor in the University in consultation with the State Government, but this law does not say that for the Governor It is not mandatory to follow the advice of the State Government
 patna training college ke pradhanacharya khagendra kumaar ne kaha he ki ve niyukti par pramukh mahalekhaakaar ke uthaae gaye sawaalon ko chunauti dene ke liye adaalat jaaenge
 Kumar said, "does the Chief Accountant General have the right to question the policies and appointments of the Governor?" tivi ke femes reality sho nach baliye sijan 9 main shuru se hi vishaal aditya singh or madhurima tuli ke jhagade or drama charchaa main rahe hai

 In 2004, he was the President of the BJP and under his leadership the BJP contested the Lok Sabha elections
 congress or left partiyon ke saath aane par ve aksar chutkiyaan lete rahe hai
 These parties, which contested against each other in West Bengal, joined together in Delhi
 venkaiya is par ye kehete hue taana maarthe the dilli main dosti kalakatta main kushti
 Now this taunt is being used in the context of BJP and Shiv Sena because in Maharashtra where the two are facing each other, they are seen together in Delhi
 modi sarkaar main anant geete baari udyog maamalon ke cabinet mantri bane hue hai
 Not only does he go to his ministry amidst head wagging between the two parties in Maharashtra but he also attended the Council of Ministers meeting for the first time after the expansion of the Modi cabinet
 jab dilli main bijepi netaaon se poocha jaataa he ki kya geete istipha denge to unka jawaab hota he aap ye sawaal shivasena se puuchhen
 When reporters ask, what will happen if Shiv Sena mps do not support the government during voting on a bill in Parliament, on which they say that the government in which their minister is involved, if the same party against any decision of that government If mps vote in Parliament, then you can understand yourself what will happen
 yani bijepi ko puri ummid he ki dilli main ye naubat hi nahin aegi ki shivasena uskaa saath chhod de
 However, it has happened before when Shiv Sena did not support BJP in the presidential election
 lekin, sansad main upie ke khilaaf takreeban har mudde par vah bijepi ke saath khadi nazar ai he
 But, Shiv Sena's attitude has caused a big headache for BJP
 uske haath se sansad kaa sanyukt satr bulaane kaa trump card haath se phisalata nazar aa rahaa he
 In fact, when the Congress did not support the insurance bill in the budget session, the managers of the government kept saying in private conversation that this bill can be passed by calling a joint session if needed
 agar shivasena ke saath dilli kii dosti mumbai kii hi tarah kushti main badalati he to bijepi kaa sanyukt satr kaa ye hathiyaar kund ho saktaa he
 The joint session is usually called when it is absolutely necessary
 vaajapeyi sarkaar aatankwaad virdohi kanoon pota ko paarit karaane ke liye sansad kaa sanyukt satr bula chuki he
 The NDA government does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha and the NDA will not have a majority in the joint session even if the relationship with the Shiv Sena breaks down at the Center
 sanyukt satr main kisi bhi vidheyak ko paarit karaane ke liye 392 saansad hone chahien or abhi endie ke paas 396 saansad hai
 If the Shiv Sena's 21 mps, 18 Lok Sabha and three Rajya Sabha are removed from it, then the NDA figure is 375, i
e
 the majority se 17 kam
 In such a situation, the NDA will have to join any party which is not in the NDA to pass any bill in the joint session
 haalanki, sarkaar ke prabandhak aashwast hai ki aisa nahin hoga
 According to him, the first thing is that the Shiv Sena will not leave the NDA at the center because in this case the BJP will break with the Shiv Sena in the local bodies of Maharashtra
 unhen ye bhi ummid he ki der saver maharashtra main sarkaar main hissedari ko lekar shivasena ke saath samjhauta ho jayega
 The managers say that even if the Shiv Sena leaves the center, many such parties will still be found to support the ruling party
 isamen ensipi, bijedy or ediemke kaa naam pramukhataa se liya jaataa he
 But if everything happens in politics according to numbers, then questions also arise about morality
 ye koun si naitikta he ki aise do dal jo ek rajya kii vidhansabha main aamane−saamne baithe hon, centre main saath mil kar sarkaar chalaaen
 There should be an ideological basis for protest and also for support
 yahi sawaal ensipi kaa saath lene par bhi uthta he
 But when the sole goal of politics becomes the chair, then who talks about morality

 (input bhashaa se) The most common response of a human being to achievement is not satisfaction, but desire for more; Or, we are not satisfied by living a peaceful or prosperous life
 iske bajaae jab hakeekat hamaari aakankshaon ke anuroop hoti he tabhi ham santusht hote hai
 But the bad news is that as conditions improve, our aspirations increase; Or, to try to achieve real happiness, you should reduce the effort of your pleasant feeling, it should not be increased
 ''yuvaal noah haraari ne santushti, aakanksha or khushi kii koshish main duniya main ho rahe nirantar badlaavon ke maddenjar homo deyas: aane vaale kal kaa sankshipt itihaas rach daalaa
 In this, on the basis of the events of history and the changes happening in different areas in the present era, they do not imagine a world that is slowly emerging in front of us

 His third book 21 Lessons for 21 Century appeared in English last year
 (iskaa ek adhyay aap is saal kii india today sahitya varshiki main pard sakate hai
 ) However, Harari Homo Deyes, professor of world history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, states that most people died due to three reasons: famine, pestilence, and war
 ab in teenon kii vajah se hone vaali maut kaaphi kam ho gai he; ve dheron misaalon ke jariye ise spasht karte hai
 There is no divine power behind them but a human lapse

 The right to life is a fundamental right and death violates it
 koi vyakti mahaj dil kaa daura padane yaa kisi durghatana main nahin marataa balki dhamniyon ke sankuchit hone se dil kaa daura padataa he yaa kisi kii galati se durghatana hoti he
 Similarly, it is also right to seek happiness

 He argues that humans will try to improve themselves to become homo deyes or 'human gods' or 'superhuman'
 ve bataate hai ki aisa teen tarah se hoga: pehla, biological ejineering ke tahat sharir ke puraane or vikrut angon ko badal diya jayega yaa phir unhen jaldi kharaab nahin hone diya jayega
 Second, non-biological parts will be added to the body under cyborg engineering

 The purpose of all this is to keep the human being alive forever and Google's company Calico is working in this direction
 vaise, haraari yah spasht kar dete hai ki vigyaan or technology main tarakkee ke baavjood abhi insaan kii prakritik umr kareeb 90 saal he
 So, Calico may not be able to keep Google's boss alive forever in the near future, something his next generation can expect! Harari argues that humans and their thinking will eventually turn into chemical processes and algorithms
 in elgoridm ko artificial intelligence main tabdeel kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, they say that every thought is an ongoing chemical reaction in our brain, which can be seen in a brain scan
 haalanki haraari ne ise mahatvapurn aadhaar banaaya he lekin dimag ke bare main abhi bahut jaankaree nahin he
 The wonders of biological engineering are visible

 With this the need for consciousness is becoming less

 These conclusions have been drawn in view of countless incidents in the book
 pathak inamen se kuch se sahamat bhale na hon par haraari kii daleel ko nazarandaaj nahin kar sakate
 The translation is good, but the religion is oftentimes used for religion and perhaps' followers of one religion are right '(page -196),' Harari may not have even thought of using 'religion'! This book is for all those people Readable for those who have a future! This may advise them to change themselves over time and contribute to a better world

 Riyaz said that Bilawal will participate in a rally to be held on April 4 at Garhi Khuda Baksh in Sindh province on the death anniversary of his maternal grandfather and former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto

 pipipi ke aantarik sutron ne isse pehle bataaya tha ki bilaval ahm muddon se party ke nipatane ke sambandh main jaradaari or unki bahan faryaal talpur ke saath matbhed paidaa hone ke baad dubai chale gaye the
 These important issues of differences included terrorist violence, ethnic attacks on Shias and the issue of party ticket distribution for elections
 lekin riyaj ne kaha, 'bilaval kii vaapasi ne un afvaahon ko shant kar diya he ki unka apane pita yaa buaa se koi matbhed tha
 He often visits Dubai and his leaving the country should not be seen in another context
 'unhone kaha ki bilaval lagaataar gambhir khatre kaa saamana kar rahe hai or 'hamen is baat ko nahin bhoolanaa chahie
 The PPP was projecting Bilawal as its star campaigner in the election and party leaders tried to quell the news of differences between Bilawal and Zardari
 bilaval khud chunaav nahin lard sakenge kyonki vah sitambar main 25 saal ke honge

 The BJP has announced its alliance in Tamil Nadu
 ek hi din main maharashtra ke baad tamilnadu doosraa rajya he jahaan bijepi ne gathbandhan banane main deree nahin kii he
 There the BJP and Shiv Sena have agreed to contest the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections together
 tamilnadu main loksabhaa kii kul 39 siton main se ediemke 27 siton par ladegi jabaki piemke 7 or bijepi 5 siton par ladegi
 This alliance is also important in Tamil Nadu because the AIADMK has left its 10 existing seats for the alliance
 yani unke maujuuda 10 saansadon kaa tikat is ghoshnaa ke saath hi cat chukaa he
 The remaining seats will have new faces, that will be separate
 ediemke or bijepi gathbandhan kii ummid logon ko pehle se hi thi
 Its signs were found from the time when Thambi Durai was made the Deputy Speaker at the beginning of this Lok Sabha
 magar disambar 2016 main jayalalita ke nidhan ke baad jo uthapatak ediemke main machi or party par kabje ko lekar jo ladaai machi usase gathbandhan kisase hoga, is par ek sawalia nishaan lag gaya tha
 The aiadmk's quarrel over the party symbol came up to the Election Commission of Delhi, but when it was decided that only Chief Minister Palanisamy and former Chief Minister Panneerselvam would get the two-leaf mark of the AIADMK, the Delhi parties breathed a sigh of relief
 bijepi ne tamilnadu main jis tarah se gathbandhan kiya he vah bijepi ke dakshin bharat main vistaar ke plan kii taraf ishaara karata he
 It is also believed that this alliance has been strengthened with the arrival of PMK and is in a good position to compete
 duusari ore dekha jaae to dakshin ke paanch rajyon tamilnadu,kerala, karnataka, telugana or andhrapradesh kii kul 129 lok sabha siton main se bijepi ke paas keval 20 siten hi hai
 Of this, 17 seats are only from Karnataka and out of the remaining 99 seats in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, BJP has only 3 seats
 mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi kerala main is baar khaataa khol sakati he, magar karnataka, jahaan bijepi ko 2014 main 17 siten mili thim, main is baar use mashkkat kerani pad sakati he kyonki karnataka vidhansabha main aae nateezon ke baad yadi congress or jedy-es ke vot pratishat ko jod diya jaae to yah 56 fisadi tak pahunchataa he
 But the biggest question is whether this alliance remains till the Lok Sabha elections
 yani dakshin main bijepi ko kaaphi jor lagaana padegaa, nae saathi dhundne honge tabhi jaakar baat banegi
 Now let's talk about Tamil Nadu again
 
 
 sabko intjaar he ki congress is gathbandhan ke jawaab main kya daanv khelegi
 If sources are to be believed, the congress-aiadmk alliance is firm and only seats are yet to be announced
 yah isse bhi andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki diemke netaa stallin congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko pradhanmantri banane kii baat kehane vaale sabase pehle netaa the
 Then, in all the meetings and rallies held by the opposition, Stalin grew up and participated
 tamilnadu main diemke 20 siton par ladegi or congress 10 par
 Some seats are reserved for smaller parties
 san 2009 main tamilnadu main diemke ko 18 or congress ko 8 siten mili thim jabaki visike ko ek seat mili thi
 Let's see when the Congress and DMK alliance is announced, but it is certain that the Lok Sabha elections are going to be quite interesting even in the far south

 srilanka ke khilaaf hyderabad vanade muqabla viraat kohli ke liye khaas tha
 The reason for this is not the victory in the series against Sri Lanka or the record of the fastest 6000 in ODI history, but a special audience present in the stadium
 twitor par uda tha viraat-anoushka kaa majaakadarasal film actress anoushka sharma khud stadium main maujuud thim
 Now she came to see the match or someone special, decide it yourself
 vaise anoushka kii maujuudagi main kohli kaa balla bhi garja
 Even though he did not put up a hundred, he did offer a perspective of Fifty
 jiskaa anoushka ne behad hi garmjoshi se swaagat kiya
 As soon as the half-century was over, Anushka stood in her seat and gave a thumbs up
 jawaab main kohli kaa jashn manaane kaa andaaj bhi juda tha yaa phir ye kahen ki khullam khulla pyaar kaa elaan
 After completing Fifty, Kohli first took off his helmet and greeted the audience with a bat on the left
 iske baad unhone helmet ko choomaa
 Finally kissed the bat and gave it a flying kiss
 ab yah kiske liye tha yah aap hi tay kiijie
 By the way, the gesture is enough for the wise people, now there is no such celebration every time you make Fifty
 Don't let anyone ever stop you

 vah sirf chaar varsh kii thi, jab uske parivaar main kamaane vaale akele sadsy uske pita kii maut ho gai
 Rubina and her mother (all changed names), who were on the verge of starvation, tried their best to make a living, working as domestic help in the neighbors' homes
 rubina kii badi bahan kii shaadi ke liye unhen tiruanantpuram ke paas kajhakuttem main sthit apane ek maatr anya sahare teen saint (ek acre kaa 100waan hissaa) jameen ko bhi bech dena padaa
 After this, the desperate mother-daughter, who was barely paying the rent of her small hut, got a 'real' opportunity to overcome poverty for the first time
 rubina ab 19 varsh kii ho gai thi
 Her neighbor Shanta, with the help of her friend, 'gulf Country Businesswoman' Lizzie Suzanne, offered her a job as a sweeper in Muscat
 sach main yah ofer kaaphi aakarshak lagane vaala tha-passport or vija banavaane main madad ke saath hi 25,000 ru
 Monthly salary promise
 11 june, 2012 ko rubina ‘nesi’ ke rup main ajman main utari
 a colleague of Suzanne made a fake passport for Rubina in the same name
 usee vyakti ne ek adhikari ko ghoose dekar kerala ke nedumbasri (kochi) sthit airport par rubina ko imigration se nikalne main madad kii thi
 After this she was taken to Muscat, lying in a car diggy and there she met Suzanne for the first time
 agle din use ek flats kii ‘safai’ ke liye bheja gaya jahaan ek ajanabi vyakti ne uske saath balaatkaar kiya, lekin yah to vastav main uske lambey duruswapn kii bas shuruyaat hi thi
 She was badly trapped because she could not even complain to the local police administration due to the use of fake passports
 iske baad alag-alag mardon ne kai hafton tak rubina kaa daihik shoshan kiya
 They were customers of Suzanne, Rubina's 'mentor' in Muscat
 rubina ko yaad he ki is dauraan kai baar use ek din main 50 se zyada mardon ke saath hambistar hona padaa
 After some time she fell ill and was then allowed to call her sister in Kerala
 sujen ne pehle to rubina ko chhodie ke liye 2 lakh ru
 Demanded, but later Rs 25,000
 lekar use chhod diya
 But Rubina's troubles did not end
 mumbai airport par 5 july, 2012 ko uske utarate hi farji passport kii vajah se use giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Subsequently, when the Kerala police investigated the case, an international sex racket was revealed in which poor, helpless young women from Kerala are lured into the world of sex trade by luring them to lucrative jobs in the Gulf countries
 police maanati he ki aise antarrashtriya sex mafia kaa kaam ab kerala ke gaanvon tak fail gaya he
 After Rubina's story appeared in newspapers, many women have lodged complaints about the racket runners and agents
 kerala police ke krime branch ke dspi pi
 M
 vargeez ne bataaya ki rubina ke alaava chaar mahilaon ne sujen ke khilaaf shikaayat kii he
 Crime branch officials investigating this case since July 24, 2012, have received information about 12 young women who have been sent to Gulf countries through fake passports
 unhen aise har maamle main airport adhikariyon kii mileebhagat najar aati he
 Circle Inspector Biju Kumar of the Crime Branch, who is responsible for the investigation, said that the head of this racket, Sujen, had probably sent more than 150 women to Dubai for prostitution
 ’’ is racket ke taar kahaan tak faile hai, iske puri tarah se khulaase ke liye 43 varsh kii sujen se poochtacha jaruri he
 Therefore, Biju Kumar has sought help from the diaspora to file a complaint against Suzanne in several West Asian countries
 isse sujen ko kerala waapas laane main madad milegi
 In the same episode, on October 19, 38-year-old Setu Lal alias Bashir and 42-year-old Shaji were arrested from Thrissur, who used to implicate poor women in their web
 police kaa kahana he ki sujen ke paas aise farjivada karne vaale kushal karmchaariyon kaa network he jo farji passport or vija banaate hai
 Recently, Shanta, a broker of Suzanne, told the police that Suzanne has bought property in Karumatra near her village in Thrissur with her earnings
 vidambnaa hi he ki khud sujen ne bhi apana bachapan garibi main bitaayaa he
 After leaving school midway, she worked as a maid in a small factory in Karumatra
 yaheen par kaam ke dauraan use apana jivan saathi mila
 After this he started the vegetable business in Thrissur market and after a few years he made his entry into the Gulf
 biju kumaar ne bataaya ki usne shuru main apane gaanv kii hi ladakiyon ko shikaar banaaya, jinhen usne gharelu naukaraani, cells girl yaa safai karmi kaa kaam dilaane kaa vaada kar fansaaya tha
 But soon the villagers understood about his real racket
 aaj vah karumatra main badnaam ho chuki he
 According to Biju Kumar, it is very difficult to arrest him when he comes to Kerala
 ve isaki vajah bataate hai, ‘‘vah kai passport or farji naamon kaa istemaal karti he
 The organized sex racket connecting the coastal areas of Kerala to the Gulf was first busted in August 2007
 pattanmathitta jile kii 46 varsh kii ek mahila sauda bivi par aarope laga tha ki usne 32 varsh kii ek mahila ko deh vyapaar ke liye sharajah bheja he
 The victim returned home with the help of a "customer"
 usne police ko bataaya ki sharajah main kam-se-kam 300 mahilaon ko veshyavriti ke liye bheja gaya he
 The victim woman filed a petition in the Kerala High Court after which the wife, her daughter Shamiya and her aide Alambadi Ahmed were arrested in 2011
 kosicode main sakriy anveshi naam ke enjio kii pramukh kaaryakarta 52 varshiya ke
 Ajita helps women in the fight against sexual exploitation
 ajita kaa kahana he ki khadi sex racket ab bhi is vajah se fal-phool rahaa he kyonki kerala or khadi deshon, donon jagahon ke prashasan ke log aise racket ke sutaradhaaron ko pakadaaey main anakani kar rahe hai
 "few convicts have been caught and punished," he said
 isaki vajah se peedit mahilaayein shikaayat karne ko lekar hatotsahit dikhti hai
 Malayalam poet Rammohan Paliath, who spent nearly 12 years in the Gulf, said that 90 percent of Malayali prostitutes are used as 'maids'
 yah dhandha itnaa paise vaala he ki pakade gaye or jail jane vaale log bhi phir se dhandhe main utar jate hai
 But the local police officers of most Gulf countries have a different view
 unka kahana he ki malayalam sex workars kaa istemaal pramukh rup se kerala se aae mazdooron or shramikon ke ‘‘manoranjan’’ ke liye hi kiya jaataa he
 An immigrant Indian reported that in Dubai "it seems that the police have been instructed to ignore the Malayali brothels"
 ’’rubina shaayad bhaagyashaalee thi
 The 19-year-old girl arrived at the Mumbai airport on July 5, 2012, but it cannot be guessed how many women, like her, have been pushed to hell on flights to Dubai, Sharjah, Muscat and Ajman
 
 bharat-america kii ranneetik bhagidaari or majboot vyavsaayik sambandh ko dekhte hue america raashtrapati baraak obama ko bengalooru (bharat) or buffelo (america) donon jagah rojgaar ke avasar paidaa karne ke bare main sochna chahie na ki sirf buffelo main
 This is stated by a former NASSCOM president in his statement before a forum of the US administration
 nascom ke purv adhyaksh jeri raav ne america antarrashtriya vyapaar ayog (yuaceitisi) ke samaksh apane ek bayaan main kaha he, vaastaviktaa yah he ki america ko buffelo or bengalooru donon main rojgaar ke avasar paidaa karan par dhyaan dena or yah donon ke liye acha hoga
 Rao was present during the USITC hearing on 'trade, Investment and Industrial Policies in India: Impact on American Economy'
 raav ne kaha ki obama ke kuch saal pehle die gaye bayaan kaa hawala diya, jisamen unhone bengalooru se rojgaar ke maukey buffelo laane kii baat kahi thi
 Rao said, "we believe that in 2009 the President's speech writers made a mistake in understanding and wrote that the initiative to provide employment in Buffalo rather than Bengaluru should help
" unhone kaha ki mahinebhar baad hi praudyogiki kshetra ke mukhya kaaryakariyon kii parishad ne ek rapat jari kii, jisamen kaha gaya ki kar niti main prastaavit badlaav se 22 lakh america nagarikon ko rojgaar se haath dhonaa padegaa
 Not only this, 82 in investment in machine plants and properties in America

 He said, the truth is that the relationship between the information technology industry of America and India is decades old
 yah sahjiviyon kaa sabandh he
 Both are benefiting from this and both countries are benefiting from it
 raav ne america ke naye vibhedakaari vija vidheyak ke mudde par america prashasan or america sansad se dhiraj ke saath badhane kii apil kii kaha ki is tarah ke kananu se america companiyon or lambe samay se chale aa rahe soochna praudyogiki bhagidaaron ke bich sambandh bighad jayega

 yeashrambabavirendra dev dikshit naam ke ek shaks kaa he
 This ashram asserts itself to be associated with the principles of Prajapita Brahmakumari Divine University
 lekin abashrampar rajasthan kii ek ladki ko bandi banane kaa aarope laga he
 The victim had disappeared from her home in Jhunjhunu three days ago and was found at the Vodilli Ashram based on the phone's location
 ladki ke parivaar waalon ko kal usase milwaaya bhi gaya, lekin ladki ne kaha ki wo yaheen rahanaa chaahati he
 However, family members allege that the girl has been intimidated
 usase akele main bhi milane nahin diya gaya
 Whether the family's allegations are true and what is going on inside is being investigated
 lekin is bich hamen mili ek aisi ladki jo khud isashramame rah chuki he or uskaa aarope he ki baba virendra dev dikshit ne use apni havas kaa shikaar banaaya he
 Not only this, according to the girl, Baba used to call all the girls living in the ashram in his room
 unke saath rape karata tha
 This girl says that she also told her family to her family, but no one believed her

 ' When Uddhav Thackeray and his family members gathered at the BMC Standing Committee Hall to celebrate the party's new mayor, BJP councilors made him feel his presence

 thodi der ke liye to thakare parivaar ke sadsy is ghatnakram se hatprabh rah gaye lekin jald hi shivasena ke parshadon ne morcha sambhaal liya or 'jai bala sahib' ke naare lagaae
 Earlier this morning, Shiv Sena's Vishwanath Pandurang Mahadeshwar was elected the new mayor of Mumbai with the support of BJP
 sho of hands main bhaajapa ne shivasena ke ummidavaar kaa saath diya
 After giving a thorn to the Shiv Sena in the BMC election in Mumbai, the BJP decided not to contest the post of Mayor
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne isaki ghoshnaa karte hue kaha tha ki bijepi ab mumbai ke meyar kaa chunaav nahin ladegi
 Also, the party decided not to contest the election of deputy mayor
 unhone kaha ki yah faisla mumbai kii janata ke hiton ko dekhte hue or unke janamat ko sammaan dene ke liye liya gaya

 aise main shivesna ke kilaaf meyar pad ke ummidavaar ko khadaa karne par bhaajapa ko rajya sarkaar main shivasena kaa samarthan kho dene kaa dar tha
 The decision to endorse is an attempt to keep its government in the state

 The Shiv Sena emerged as the single largest party in this election with 84 seats
 bhaajapa ko 82 siten mili or vah maamuli antar se hi shivasena se pichad gai
 It is worth mentioning that this step of BJP is a very nappy-political decision
 maharashtra main sarkaar banane main shivasena ko bhaajapa kaa samarthan praapt he
 In such a situation, the BJP feared losing the support of the Shiv Sena in the state government when it fielded a candidate for the post of mayor against Shivesana

 hamaari janareshan ne vaise to sunil gavaskar ko cricket khelte shaayad hi dekha ho lekin vah hameshaa hi hamaari najaron main rahe hai
 Sometimes by becoming a selector and sometimes by being the guide of the Indian cricket team
 ve hamaari pichhali pidiyon ke liye cricket comentary sunne or televijan screen se chipke rahane kii vajah the
 He was the first cricketer from India to score 10,000 runs in Test cricket

 Whoever has read anything about Gavaskar or knows anything about them, let us add that he has been adept at playing on the pitch
 puri team ek taraf or gavaskar kaa sanyam ek taraf
 They were such that they did not even take the name of being out
 ve us daur main pich par tike rahete the jab westeindies ke gendbaajon se puri duniya ke khilaadi khauf khate the
 At that time, there was not as much security facilities today

 People can grow only with the help of those around them
 sochie ki kisi team main koi khilaadi acchhee ballebaaji to kare lekin duusare uskaa saath na den to kaise parinaam milenge

 ve gajab ke hazirajavaab or hansod hai
 
 
 Once on a show an audience asked him which format he liked more in Test cricket and twenty-twenty
 unka twarit jawaab tha twanti-twanti, kyonki vahaan kam fielding kerani hoti he
 5
 ve khud ke bajaay team ko adhik mahatv dete hai
 
 
 a close look at Gavaskar's style of playing says that he has always been a great team member
 apane saathiyon ko hameshaa saath lekar chalate hai
 They have always been encouraging the companions undergoing bad phase

 He said that Kashmir was his second home during his journey to be associated with the Intelligence Bureau

 There has been no change in Kashmiriyat
 aise main ashavan hum ki main nae kashmir, ek shantipurna ghati kii disha main yogadan de sakuunga jahaan samruddhi or rosemara kii baat hogi
 PM Modi said in his speech of August 15 that 'no abuses, no bullets, change will be embraced'

 Amid clashes with the Karunanidhi family over leadership in the DMK, party chief m Karunanidhi on Tuesday indirectly warned his son MK Alagiri, who lives in Madurai
 unhone kaha ki jo bhi party ke farmaan ke khilaaf jayega use nishkasit kar diya jayega
 Annoyed by Alagiri's alleged remarks for a compromise with dmk's Vijayakanth-led DMDK for the Lok Sabha elections, Karunanidhi said he himself expressed happiness over the possibility of an alliance between the two as party 'president'
 aisi khabaren thim ki alaagiri ne dramuk-dmdike ke bich gathbandhan ke khilaaf tippanee kii thi
 Trying to separate himself from Alagiri's statement, Karunanidhi said that if he is right, "there is no connection between him and the DMK"
 ' unhone yahaan samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki gathbandhan kii sambhaavna par kaaryakarini or aam parishad yaa 'adhikrut alaakaman' ko faisla karnaa he
 Alagiri's statement was contrary to Karunanidhi's statement welcoming the alliance between DMK and DMDK
 karunanidhi ne kaha, 'yah na sirf khedjanak he balki nindaneey bhi he
 ' unhone kaha, 'main yah saaf karata hum ki jo log is tarah kaa anaavashyak virodhabhasi bayaan denge or is prakaar party ke anushaasan ko prabhavit karenge, chaahe wo jo koi bhi hon, unke khilaaf anushaasanamak karrwai shuru kii jaaegi or unhen yahaan tak ki party kii praathmik sadsyta se bhi nishkasit kar diya jayega
 ' unhone kaha ki yah faisla hameshaa dramuk ke sabhi sadasyon par lagu hoga
 Karunanidhi's warning comes a day after he was reprimanded by Stalin, Alagiri's younger brother in Tiruchirappalli
 vijayakaanth kii party se dramuk ke gathbandhan karne ke khilaaf alaagiri ke kathith taur par raay jaahir karne ke bare main puche jane par stallin ne dmdike ke saath party ke gathbandhan karne kaa swaagat karte hue kaha tha ki vah is tarah kii anaavashyak khabaren nahin padhate
 The differences between Alagiri and Stalin are well known
 karunanidhi ke rajnatik uttaradhikari ke mudde par donon ke bich takaraav chal rahaa he
 The 90-year-old DMK chief has indicated several times that Stalin could be his successor
 alaagiri ne ise chunauti dete hue kaha tha ki vah karunanidhi ke atirikt kisi ko bhi apana netaa nahin maanenge

 america ke navnirvaachit raashtrapati donald trump ne sanket diya he ki vah rus par lage pratibandh hataa sakate hai or yadi china apni mudra evam vyapaar nitiyon main sudhaar nahin karata he to vah 'van china' niti ke saath khadey nahin honge
 Donald Trump said in an interview published in 'the Wall Street Journal' on Friday that he imposed sanctions imposed by US President Barack Obama's administration on Russia last month over alleged cyber attacks by Moscow to influence the US election
 At least for some time
 unhone kaha ki lekin yadi rus hinsak atvaad se nipatane jaise ahm lakshyon ko hasil karne main america kii madad karata he to vah dandatmak kadamon ko hataa sakate hai
 Trump said he is ready to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin after taking charge on January 20
 trump ne putin kii saraahna kii or keval anichhaa se america khufia vibhaag ke is nishkarsh ko sweekaar kiya ki roosi haikaron ne putin ke aadesh par america chunaav main hastkshep kiya
 The comments taiwan ko rajanyik rup se manyata nahin dene kii america kii puraani niti par baat karte hue trump ne kaha, "van china samet har cheez par vaarta kii ja rahi he
 
 
 "after Trump won the election, Taiwan's President Sai Ing Wen called him to congratulate him, and Trump has already angered China by accepting Wen's congratulations over the phone
 unhone jaranal ko die saakshaatkaar main is kadam kaa bachaav karte hue kaha, "hamane pichley saal unhen do arab dollar ke sainya upkaran beche
 
 
 We can sell them two billion dollars of modern military equipment, but we are not allowed to accept phone calls
 
 
 pehali baat to yah he ki phone par baat nahin karnaa bahut hi ashisht vyavhaar hota
 
 
 " donald trump ne 'da wal street jaranal' main shuukravaar ko prakashit ek saakshaatkaar main kaha ki vah america chunaav ko prabhavit karne ke liye moscow ke kathith sibar hamalon ko lekar pichley maheene rus par america ke raashtrapati baraak obama ke prashasan dwaara lagaae gaye pratibandhon ko 'kam se kam kuch samay ke liye' barkaraar rakhenge
 He said that but if Russia helps the US to achieve its important goals like tackling violent extremism, then it can remove punitive measures
 trump ne kaha ki vah 20 janvari ko kaarybhaar grahan karne ke baad rus ke raashtrapati vladimir putin se mulaakaat karne ko taiyaar hai
 Trump praised Putin and only reluctantly accepted the US Intelligence Department's conclusion that Russian hackers interfered in the US election on Putin's orders
 tippaniyan Speaking on America's old policy of not recognizing Taiwan diplomatically, Trump said, "everything including One China is being negotiated
" 
 
 " trump ke chunaav jeetne ke baad taiwan ke raashtrapati sai ing wain ne unhen badhai dene ke liye phone kiya tha, or trump ne phone par wain kii badhai sweekaar karke china ko pehle hi naaraaz kar diya he
 He defended the move in an interview to Journal saying, "we sold him two billion dollars of military equipment last year
 
 
 ham unhen do arab dollar ke aadhunik sainya upkaran bech sakate hai, lekin hamen phone kol sweekaar karne kii anumati nahin he
 
 
 The first thing is that not talking on the phone would have been very rude behavior

 " Arvind Das's book 'the Lost City in Bekhudi - a Journalist's Notes' is also a travelogue, a report, and something like an article appearing on editorial pages
 isamen ikkisvin sadi ke donon dashak hai jisamen berlin or landan bhi he or mithila ke sudur gaanv bhi
 This book is a set of short articles by the author, which after reading it seems that its drawback is that i wish it would be explained in a bit more detail! Writers have gone out of their way to touch things - and perhaps this is the destiny of such books which appear as a set of articles
 haalanki kitaab ke sheershak main hi iskaa sanket he ki ye ‘ek patrkaar ke nots’ hai, aise main shikaayat gadhi nahin honi chahie
 But one thing is certain that this book will be interesting to those who are interested in art, literature, media, cinema and travel stories
 laghu aalekhon ke rup main likhe jane se ek phayda ye he ki shabdon kaa chayan or kharch bahut hisaab se kiya gaya he
 The talk of cinema or literature does not seem cumbersome or boring and perhaps this training is also due to the writer being a journalist
 kitaab main vishvavidhyalayon kaa varnan, europe-china kii yatra, cinema or desi shastreey kalaon se lekhak kaa prem is kitaab ko 360 degree kaa bana detaa he
 As the author himself has written that 'a person who grows in the courtyard of kamala-balan' obviously learns to love rivers

 After meeting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Home Minister p Chidambaram, his party leaders LK Advani and Nitin Gadkari, Yeddyurappa told reporters that there is no evidence against any minister of the charges and action will be taken only when there is strong evidence

 The film reviews by the critics are considered to be fantastic as well as the characters are strong
 dekhnaa yah he ki nai kahani ke saath anil kapur (anil Kapoor) audiyans or apane phans ko kitna rijhaa pate hai
 In this film, apart from Anil and Sonam Kapoor, Rajkummar Rao, who is considered to be the best actor, is also attracting people with his presence
 bataa den, 1994 main ai film '1942 e lav story' ko aage badhaate hue ab anil kapur bade chehre se film chalaane main kaamyaab nahin ho sakate
 He will also entice the audience with a powerful story
 film ne digitaly or satellite ke jariye 24 se 25 karod rupye kii kamai pehle se hi kar lee he
 The expected loss due to this is quite low
 metro city main darshakon ko cinemagharon tak khinchakar laane main thodi mushkil bhi ho rahi he
 This is because audiences can still have film options like 'uri', 'manikarnika' and 'thackeray'
 anil kapur apni beti ke saath nai kahani lekar aae hai
 In this story, all aspects including romance, emotion, drama have been introduced
 'ek ladki ko dekha to aisa laga' (ek Ladki Ko Dekha To Aisa Laga) film main anil kapur (anil Kapoor) kii beti kaa role khud unki asal life kii beti sonam kapur (sonam Kapoor) nibhaa rahi hai
 After the release of the film, people will be eyeing the father-daughter relationship in the real to reel onscreen for the first time
 film aaj ke jamaane ke hisaab se aage badhati hui dikhaai de rahi he
 Apart from the three main characters of this film, the fourth character is also of Juhi Chawla, who is coming to color on the Bollywood screen after 3 years

 It is said that a person learns from his mistakes
 phir baat dhalati umr kii ho to tevar bhi badal hi jate hai
 Something similar is also seen with Salman Khan these days
 bhai jaan, kuch aise tewaron main najar aa rahe hai jo pehle kabhi nahin dekhe gaye or jo unke kai chaahane waalon ko pasand bhi nahin aa rahe hai
 Of course, Bhaijaan is looking to be very good, and it has started appearing in his films as well as in real life
 lekin unki persenelity par mafik nahin baithta he
 Have started reading, look at the case of Katrina, this is the case of Katrina Kaif
 katrina ke saath unki prem kahaniyaan pehle kaaphi prachlit rahi hai
 It is often said that Bhaijaan's love for Katrina was well known, although Bhai never said anything like this
 lekin ab aisa lagane laga he ki ateet main jarur kuch rahaa hoga
 There must have been some black in the pulses
 tabhi to bhaijan in dinon katrina naam ke kaside padhate najar aa rahe hai
 From Bigg Boss to Comedy Nights Live, when Katrina reached Bigg Boss for the promotion of the film Fitur, Bhaijaan got Katrina's Fitoor there
 ve ek ke baad ek tarif karne lage
 He told Katrina Kaif from the strongest woman to the unknown
 unki ankhon main katrina ko lekar ek chamak thi or gujarey jamaane kii yaaden saream saaf najar aa rahi thim
 Now they have reached behind-the-scenes Comedy Nights Live behind Katrina
 katrina main phir dikhne laga dossub sochane vaali baat he ki bhai ke tevar badale kaise? lijie yah bhi bataae dete he
 a few days ago there was news of Katrina's breakup with Heeranbir Kapoor
 lagata he bhaijan ne is khabar ko kuch zyada hi gambhirtha se le liya or umr ke pachaasawein padaav main pahunch chuke bhaijan ko katrina main phir se ek apana-sa dost najar aane laga, bilkul maine pyaar kiya jaisaa
 It was the same Salman Khan who a few months ago made every use of every opportunity where he could tighten up Katrina
 ek angel yah bhi ho saktaa he kifiturfilm ko lekar janata main kuch khaas fitur najar nahin aa rahaa he
 Aditya Roy Kapur and Katrina's pair looks breathless, and the X-factor of the strong red-haired Katrina seems completely missing
 ab aise main agar bhaijan kaa saath mil jaae to film kii kuch takadir badal jaae
 Perhaps our generous brother-in-law would have thought that Katrina's Naiya crosses this time again
 phens ko nahin pasand ye salamaub jaraa baat karte hai unke phans kii
 One of his thirteen-year-old fan, seeing this changed color of Salman, said so much, "what has happened to Salman?" 
 
 ” beshak salmaan bindaas or jindadil logon ke hero hai or unhen kabhi bhi kisi ko muska maarthe nahin dekha gaya he
 This time, his soft attitude is not embracing everyone
 aisa hi ek anya chaahane vaale kaha ki “yarabhaijanko aisa nahin karnaa chahie

 '' Do you know who is running our Hindi film industry, ie Bollywood
 
 
 ? We know, you have a difficult answer to this question, but Google, the most popular search engine in the Internet world, has an answer, and that is the answer - Salman Khan
 
 
 haalanki google yah naam jawaab ke taur par nahin paros rahaa he, lekin jaise hi aap google par talash karte hai, 'who runs Bollywood' (bollywood ko koun chalaata he), vah hameshaa kii tarah javaabon kii ek list yuzar ke saamne paros detaa he, lekin sabase upar aata he 'google diarect' kii ore se diya gaya jawaab, jo darasal bollywood ke 'dabang' star ko varsh 2002 ke hit and ran maamle main court se sazaa sunaae jane kii khabar kaa link he, lekin is link main salmaan khan kaa naam baaki sari taharir ke mukaable mote, yani 'bold' aksharon main dikhaai detaa he, jo kahin na kahin kam jaankaar yuzar ko yah bhram de saktaa he ki uske 'mul sawaal' kaa jawaab yahi naam he
 
 
 The comments vaise, google ke search ingine is tarah ke ajeebogareeb jawaab pehle bhi paroste rahe hai, or ab bhi paros rahe hai
 
 
 If you write like this question, 'who runs the world', then you don't have any answer from 'google Direct', but the first link is a popular one by pop singer and Hollywood actress Beyoncé Knowles
 The video comes
 
 
 lekin 'google diarect' kii ore se sabase dilachasp jawaab miltaa he, aisa hi sawaal america film industry hollywood ke bare main karne par, yani 'who runs Hollywood' (hollywood ko koun chalaata he)
 
 
 On this question, 'google Direct' gives the answer - Jewish
 
 
 haalanki yah bhi ek samachar kaa link he, jo 'newobserveronline
 com 'was published in July 2014
 
 
 is sawaal ke javaabon se judi ek or dilachasp baat yah he ki 'google diarect' ke is infobox ke baad jo 10 nattejey pehle pej par google aapke saamne parosega, unamem se bhi paanch kehete hai 'yahudee hollywood ko chalaate hai', ek kaa kahana hota he 'iluminati hollywood ko chalaate hai', or ek jawaab he 'samalangik yahudee hollywood ko chalaate hai'
 
 
 So, now we do not know when Google is going to make the next change in its search algorithm (google Search Algorithm) to 'correct' these answers, but till then find similar questions, and read the answers and laugh out loud Go 
 
 ham jaanate hai, aapke paas is sawaal kaa jawaab hona mushkil he, lekin internet kii duniya main sabase lokapriy search ingine kahe jane vaale google ke paas iskaa jawaab maujuud he, or vah golmol jawaab he - salmaan khan
 
 
 Although Google is not serving this name as an answer, but as you search on Google, 'who runs Bollywood' (who runs Bollywood), it serves a list of answers to the user as usual
 , But above all comes the reply from 'google Direct', which is actually a link to the news of the 'dabangg' star of Bollywood being sentenced to court in the 2002 hit and run case, but in this link Salman Mine's The rest than many Tahrir obese, meaning "bold" appears in the letters, which could give somewhere confusion far less knowledgeable user that his answer to the name of the original question
 
 
 tippaniyan By the way, Google's search engines have been serving such strange answers before, and are still serving
 
 
 agar aap isi sawaal kii tarah likhen, 'who runs the world' (duniya ko koun chalaata he), to aapke paas 'google diarect' kii ore se koi jawaab nahin aata, lekin pehla link pop singer or hollywood abhinetri bionse noles ke ek lokapriy video kaa aata he
 
 
 But the most interesting answer comes from 'google Direct', the same question about the American film industry Hollywood, ie 'who runs Hollywood' (who runs Hollywood)
 
 
 is sawaal par 'google diarect' jawaab detaa he - yahudee (jews)
 
 
 However this is also a news link which 'newobserveronline
 com' par july, 2014 main prakashit hua tha
 
 
 Another interesting thing related to the answers to this question is that after the infobox of 'google Direct', 10 of the results that Google will serve in front of you on the first page, five of them say 'jews run Hollywood', one says There is 'illuminati drives Hollywood', and one answer is 'gay Jews drive Hollywood'
 
 
 so, ab ham nahin jaanate ki google in javaabon ko 'sahi' karne ke liye apane search elgoridam (google Search Algorithm) main aglaa badlaav kab laane vaala he, lekin tab tak aise hi sawaal talaashiye, or javaabon ko padhakar hansate-hansate lotpot ho jaaie

 agar bharat or pakistan ke aapasi sambandhon ko behatar banane kii koshish sachhee or gambhir he to hurriyat ke alaava, bharat ke najariye se kam se kam chaar aise moolbhoot masale hai, jinke hal kii jarurat he
 First, to find a solution to the Kashmir issue
 donon sarkarein un uplabdhiyon ko nakaarne ke mood main dikh rahi hai, jo janvari, 2004 main atal bihari vaajapeyi ke islamabad daure main islamabad ghoshnaptr jari hone, tathaa usee saal satinder lamba or tarik azeej ke bich back-door policy ke tahat baatcheet shuru hone ke baad ke teen saalon main hasil huin
 Documents show that the interlocutors had agreed that the final solution to the Jammu and Kashmir issue would be to avoid border and common people interchange, and that we should increase the movement of friends and relatives across the Line of Control
 Have to focus on
 kaarobaar or saanskrithik sambandhon ko kashmir ke donon hisson main badhaane par bhi sahmati jataai gai thi, or ek sanyukt prabandhan ke jariye line of control ke aar-paar rah rahe logon ke liye seemaa rekha ko apraasangik banane kii baat bhi shaamil thi
 It is true that this agreement achieved under the back-door policy was not brought before either of the governments for confirmation, but since the negotiators were talking as representatives of their respective governments, such It can be said that the talks give some idea about the government's proposals
 doosraa masalaa, line of control (or kai baar antarrashtriya seemaa rekha par) par golibari se judaa he, jo kai baar barbar jaan padataa he, jisamen na keval sena ke javaanon kii maut hoti he, balki seemaa ke aasapaas rahane vaale aam naagarik bhi isaki chapet main aa jate hai
 Their property is also damaged, and many times they have to be displaced
 aisi nindaneey ghatnaon se seemaa ke donon ore tanaav badhata he, jise media hawa detaa he
 The reality is that there is an 'inverse' relationship between talks and incidents of firing on the border
 varsh 2004 se 2008 ke bich seemapar se golibari kii ghatnaon or usase hone vaali mauton ke maamalon main kami dekhne ko mili, jab usee dauraan donon mulkon ke bich baatcheet jari thi
 After the 26 / 11 incident, as the negotiation process stopped, the number of cross-border firing cases increased in severity
 so, agar uddeshy gairzaruri jaani nuksaan ko rokna, sampatti kii barbaadi ko rokna, or seemaa se sate logon kaa visthaapan rokna he, to hamen samajhnaa hoga ki baatcheet kii prakriya shuru hone se tanaav kam hota he
 This will prevent all other unfortunate incidents, but if we do not talk, the lives of common people will be at stake
 teesraa masalaa, pakistan dwaara islamabad ghoshnaptr (2004) main kiye gaye seemapar se aatankwaad rokane or aisi ghatnaon ke doshiyon ko dandit karne ke vaadon se judaa he
 The question arises as to what action Pakistan has taken to prevent terrorism from across the border and to punish those who commit such heinous incidents
 haalanki pakistan ko kathghare main khadaa karnaa, baatcheet kii prakriya ko shuru karne ke lihaaj se uchit nahin he, haalanki nisandeh pakistan khud hi iske liye jimmedaar he
 India can remind Pakistan of its commitment in this matter only through dialogue
 pakistan kii sarazamin se aatankwaad kaa khatm hona baatcheet shuru karne kii shart honi chahie yaa phir baatcheet kaa masalaa hona chahie
 
 
 The Not only this, terrorist acts are also carried out by Indians in many parts of India, so should India have sympathy for Pakistan, because it is the most terrorism affected country in the world
 aatankwaad kii vajah se, or pakistani jameen par, khaskar uttar-pashchimi pakistan main aatankwaad ke khilaaf paak-america yuddh ke chalate ab tak 40 hajaar pakistaniyon kii maut ho chuki he
 Should India not notice that terrorists have heavily targeted Pakistan's government establishments, including ISI headquarters in Lahore, army headquarters in Rawalpindi and Mehran Naval Center on the outskirts of Karachi
 kya bharat or pakistan aapas main, or saarc ke fremawork main bhi aapasi sambandhon ko behatar nahin bana sakate, taaki aatankwaad se nipatane ke liye donon desh ek behatar manch bana saken
 The fourth issue is a confusing question with whom to talk in Pakistan
 bharat main lagaataar yah tark diya jaataa he ki pakistan main loktantr behad kamjor he, haalanki aisa he nahin, lekin sarkaar, sena, khufia samudaay, shaktishaalee dharmik guru or bandook liye jehadi, inamen se pakistan main faisla koun letaa he
 
 
 The Whom should we talk to? 
 
 ? unase baatcheet karne kaa kya phayda, jinke haath main vastav main takat nahin hai
 
 
 The We must admit that Pakistan is a sovereign country, so it is not possible to negotiate with anyone other than the government, and at the same time it has to be kept in mind that India has been interacting with the government channels - and often they were successful
 is
 duusare saajheedaaron ko baatcheet main shaamil karnaa jamini sachai ko pahchaan lenaa bhale hi ho saktaa he, lekin yah ek chuni hui sarkaar ke bharat se baatcheet nahin karne kaa aadhaar nahin ho saktaa
 For example, can the Indian government allow Pakistani negotiators to talk directly to the Indian Army Chief, as the Indian Armed Forces are reluctant to leave Siachen
 pakistan kii chuni hui sarkaar ko sabhi gharelu sanghathanon kaa dhyaan rakhana hoga, or aisa hi bharat ko bhi karnaa hoga
 But democratically elected government has to be seen as a toy in the hands of non-power partners, undermining Pakistan's democracy, which India has always believed to be very important for improving india-pakistan relations
 is tarah, tamaam pakshon ko dekhte hue bhavishya ke liye do vikalp najar aate hai
 First, we should ignore Pakistan (whether benign or hick-ridden)
 bharat main bauddhik chintakon kaa ek tabaka (shaayad pakistan main bhi) yah maanata he ki kisi bhi ahm mudde par koi pragati nahin ho sakati he, isliye budhimaani pakistan kii upeksha karne main he or hamen videsh niti ke duusare aayam ko praathamikta deni chahie
 But adopting this option would mean accepting all issues with Pakistan
 lekin kya bharat line of control par golibari kii upeksha kar saktaa he
 
 
 The Can Pakistan ignore the lack of water in the Indus River? 
 
 ? kya bharat seemapar se ghuspaith kii upeksha kar saktaa he
 
 
 The Can Pakistan turn a blind eye to smuggling from across the border? 
 
 ? kya bharat seemapar se aane vaale aatankwaadiyon kii upeksha kar saktaa he
 
 
 The Can Pakistan give up its claim on Kashmir without final agreement
 
 
 ? kya pakistan siachin, sarkreek or wooler-tulbul par apane daavon ko anishchiya main chhod saktaa he
 
 
 The Can we leave the transit route reaching Afghanistan via Pakistan
 
 
 ? kya donon main se koi bhi desh ek-duusare ke saath kaarobaar ke avasaron ko ganvaa saktaa he
 
 
 The Will the world let the matter go like this
 
 
 ? kya hamaari parmaanu kshamtaaon se duniya bhar main chintaa nahin badhegi
 
 
 The Therefore, no, mutual neglect is not an option
 yah zyaada se zyaada ek sanak ho sakati he
 Whether we like it or not, Pakistan will continue to hurt us, and we will do the same with Pakistan, not only politically, but also in everyday life on both sides of the border, whether it is about the issue of divided families, about Bollywood
 Of shared love
 aise main agar, paraspar upeksha or paraspar sahmati kii sambhaavnaaen khaarij ho jaati hai to aage badhane kaa rasta kya bachataa he
 
 
 The Currently, there is only one option
 vah he bharat or pakistan ke bich baatcheet, jo abhi thande baste main chali gai he, lekin baatcheet ke teble par lautne ke bare main baatcheet shuru honi chahie
 Such efforts can be made at the diplomatic level, or even through a covert back-door channel, so that when the tension is reduced and efforts are made to improve mutual relations, negotiations can begin
 ise aap nirbaadh or baadhit nahin hone vaali prakriya ke taur bhi dekh sakate hai

 'ajab Yeh Tere town ki dastur hai, every man is away from humanity
 ’ dedh karod kii aabaadi vaale dilli shahar main ek noujvaan sadak par lahuluhaan padaa tha or ek madadgaar haath ke liye tadap rahaa tha
 During this, hundreds of humans passed by him, but no one extended a helping hand
 yahaan tak ki police bhi uske paas khadi thi, par vakt rahete madad ke do haath unke bhi aage nahin bade
 And then he died, in fact, not only the young man died, but also humanity died in the capital that boasted of 'dilwal Ki Delhi'
 eent, cement or kancreet kaa ye jangal, kehane ko to shahar he, ise dilli kehete hai
 But the heart of this city is as much stone as the lifeless buildings here
 yahaan kii patharilii sadaken bhi shaayad utani patharilii nahin hongi, jitna ye shahar pathar dil he
 He will be barely 20-22 years old, his mother too will have raised him under his belt
 aaj us maa kaa vah baccha aadhe ghante tak desh kii rajdhani dilli main bich sadak par tadap-tadap kar marataa rahaa, par khud ko insaan bataane vaala ek bhi insaan uski madad ko aage nahin aayaa
 During that time, a huge crowd of humans passed from that place, all humans saw a person like them dying live
 lekin kisi ne itani bhi takalif nahin kii ki ek marate hue insaan ko uthaakar aspataal pahunchaa den
 The Delhi Police, giving the slogan 'for you, always with you', also became a stone
 hameshaa der se pahunchane vaali police haroonges taur par sahi vakt par maukey par maujuud bhi thi
 In front of him, the young man was dying every moment, but the police was remembering the law made for humans, but the person for whom the law was made had forgotten the same person
 isiilie marate hue shaks kii jaan bachaane kii bajaae wo apane hi thane ke andar apni seemaa naapane ke saath-saath maukey par hi tafteesh main jute gai thi
 Forgetting that the breath of the front can be uprooted at any time and he needs humanitarianism, not law, and help is needed
 koi bhi madad ko aage nahin aayaa
 So, this process of embarrassing the whole human being continued for half an hour, and finally after half an hour this boy also became convinced that no one here would help him
 lihaaja badi mushkil se usne khud uthne kii koshish kii, lekin uth nahi paaya
 Just kept battling alone with death
 vakt bitta ja rahaa tha or khun jism se nikalakar sadak laal karata ja rahaa tha
 Then the policeman thought that let's help him now
 iske baad wo use gaadi main daalkar aspataal le gaye
 But by then it was too late, all the blood had flowed on the road
 asal main aspataal wo nahin uski laash ko bheja gaya tha
 He did not even have two helpless hands in a big city and he died in the same place while crushing
 ab sawaal ye he ki is maut ke liye jimmedaar koun he? wo log jo maut kaa tamaasha dekhte rahe yaa wo police jo vakt par kaam naa ai? vaise sachai to ye he ki us ladke kii maut ke liye sirf police ko hi kyon jimmedaar tehraaya jaae? kya un pathar dil insaanon kii koi galati nahin jo tadapate hue us ladke ke paas se bas tamashbin kii tarah guzarate chale gaye? agar us vakt ek haath bhi madad ko aage aa jaataa to kya pataa aaj bhi wo apni maa ke anchal me hota
 But alas! This could not happen
 is pathar dil shahar main har saal aise naa jane kitne log yun mar jate hai
 Many of them can be saved
 bas jarurat sirf do adad madadgaar haathon kii he
 So next time you see any agony on the road, please do not turn your face
 darasal dakshin-purvi dilli ke ambedkar nagar ilaake main bich sadak par ek yuvak kaa katl ho gaya or vahaan maujuud log tamashbin bane rahe
 He was stabbed by Sarsham and according to the people present on the spot, a young man named Raju kept on tormenting, people surrounded him
 lekin dilawaalon kii dilli main us badakismat ko koi aisa nahin mila jo use aspataal pahunchaa de
 He died by the time he was rushed to the hospital
 ab uske ghar main matam pasra he
 After all, who were the ones who attacked Raju? kyon raju par bich sadak par jaanaleva hamalaa kiya gaya
 According to family members, some boy had taken Raju
 momoj khate vakt kuch logon kaa jhagada hua, raju bich-bachaav karne pahunchaa to hamalaavaron ne us par hi chaaku or kanchi se waar kar use lahuluhan kar diya
 Raju started falling down there, on the spot, the spectacled people just kept looking at the injured Raju standing, no one tried to take him to the hospital
 wo bhi tab jab ghatnasthal se aspataal mahaj do se teen kilometre dur tha
 According to the police, the locals did not help
 jab tak pulicekarmi suresh vahaan pahunchaa tab tak pisiar bhi pahunch gai thi
 There was no negligence on his part
 vahiin is puure maamle main police kamishnar ne joint seepi ko jaanch ke aadesh de die hai
 Police have also arrested a man named Ashu in connection with Raju's murder
 lekin logon ko ab bhi yahi lag rahaa he ki agar raju ko samay se aspataal pahunchaa diya hota to uski jaan batch sakati thi
 The police may give their arguments, talk about investigation but many important questions also arise about the attitude of the police
 iske saath hi sawaal un logon par bhi uthte hai jo ghayal yuvak ko tadapata dekhne ke baavjood tamashbin bane rahe

 BJP has won the maximum number of seats in the municipal elections held in Maharashtra after the completion of 50 days of demonetisation
 chunaavon ke chauthe charan main sabase zyada siten jeet bijepi rajya kii sabase badi party ban gai he
 In the election results announced on Monday, BJP won 7 out of 11 city councils, while Congress won 2 seats and 2 seats were won by local leaders
 vidarbha main hue in chunaavon membijepine baari antar se jeet darj kii
 At the same time, the number of councilors has increased to 104 from 58 in 2012
 vahiin shivasena 14 siton se girakar 12 siton par aa pahunchi he
 The Congress won 55 seats with a deficit of 18 seats and the NCP reduced it from 35 to 24 seats
 sabhi chaar charnon par najar daalen to bijepi ke paas ab 1207 parshad hai vahiin 2012 main yah sankhya kul 398 thi
 Shivsane won 616 seats as against 359 seats last time
 congress 1065 se ghatakar 919 or ensipi 1146 se ghatakar 788 par aa pahunchi
 Significantly, all these elections have taken place after the decision of demonetisation, winning so many seats shows that people are with the decision
 haryana ke hisar upachunaav ke prachaar kaa mangalvaar ko aakiri din he
 Dalits of Mirchpur village in Hisar will not vote on the 13th
 pichley saal gaanv ke dabangon ne maamuli jhagade ke baad daliton kaa ghar phoonk diya or ek baap beti ko zindaa jala diya
 CRPF personnel are still deployed in the village
 sangeenon ke saae main ji rahe daliton kaa kahana he ki netaaon se unka bharosa uth gaya he
 After the incident of arson last year, now only 20 out of 200 Dalit families are left in the village
 jahaan hisar ke kone kone main chunaav prachaar chal rahaa he mirchpur gaanv main kisi bhi party ne prachaar nahin kiya he
 a month has passed for the note detainee, but the situation remains the same
 ATM or bainkon ke baahar line choti hone kaa naam nahin le rahi hai
 Still people are able to withdraw Rs 2500 only after spending 4-5 hours in line
 log 2500 rupee bhi tab nikaal pate hai, jabalaathn main500 ke note hon kyonki lagbhag 80 fisadi bainkon main 500 ke note dalate hi nahin hai
 In the midst of all these troubles, banks' three consecutive days of holidays are incomprehensible
 subah 9 baje se shaam 4 baje tak 2000 kacash nikaalanevaale dhirendra bataate hai ki agar chuttee ke din bank khule hote, to check se kuch paise nikaal kar ghar kaa kiraaya or doodh kaa bill de dete lekin ab to bank band hai
 Vipin, who is preparing for IAS, says on the bank closure that in such a situation, a second Saturday holiday does not make any sense
 bainkon kii teen din kii chuttee se logon kii kai planning chaupat ho gai he
 People have been in the line for more than a month and in such a situation, people's resentment is also visible
 bainkki teen dinon kii chuttee ke baad jab bank khulenge to phir se line lambii ho jaaengi or line lambii hogi to logon kaa sabar tuutegaa
 If the banks were open on these three days or two days, then people could have done their bank work on the holiday
 bainkon kii chuttee kii ghoshnaa ne logon kii is planning par bhi pani pher diya
 The question is that even if people have patience, how long? Overall, in this period of economic emergency, banks are not closed for three days

 bankam-merrill Lynch kii ek haalia analist report ke mutabik jeeyo kii ore se gigafiber ke liye teen sabsakripshan plance utaare jaaenge
 Internet connectivity will be provided in the base plan at a speed of only 100mbps

 At the same time, the third plan will include Internet access, IPTV service and iot service
 inaki keemat 500 rupee se lekar 1,000 rupee tak ho sakati he
 At present, there has been no official statement from the company regarding any plan
 keemton kii ghoshnaa reliance AGM ke dauraan kii ja sakati he
 Currently its testing is going on
 is dauraan graahakon se security diposit ke taur par 2,500 rupee yaa 4,500 rupee liya ja rahaa he
 Also 100mbps speed is being provided for internet access
 rajasthan main chaatraon ko vitarit kii jane valiskuti5 maheene pehle hi kharid lee gai he, lekin mukhyamantrivasundhara rajeke paas iske vitaran ko lekar samay hi nahin he
 It is being said that the BJP government of the state is waiting for the assembly elections to come closer
 'beti bachaao, beti padhaao'
 
 
 How serious the government of this party itself is in Rajasthan with this slogan of BJP, its view is being seen in Jaipur district
 yahaan pichley paanch maheene seadivasichatraon ko banti jane vaali skuti dhul kha rahi hai, lekin rajya sarkaar ke paas unhen baantne ke liye vakt hi nahin nikal paa rahaa
 The responsible people are saying that time has been sought from Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje
 koshish kii ja rahi he ki siem vakt de den to unheen ke haathon se chaatraon main skuti banti jaaen
 At the same time, the students say that the studies are nearing completion, but the wait for Scooty is not over
 march main hi kharid lee gai thi skootijaipur se kareeb 45 kilometre dur bassi tehsil ke tunga gaanv main anusuchit janajati ke chatravaas main kamaron main thuns-thus kar rakhi gai in skuti ko dekhakar yahi lagata he ki ye kisi company kaa godaam he
 But the reality is different
 ye skuti march ke maheene main sarkaar ne janajaatiy chaatraon ko baantne ke liye maand yojana ke tahat kharidi thim
 Scooty was bought, but the government could not find time to distribute them
 isi vajah se tarah sil karke skuti rakhi hui hai
 Scooty is blowing dust as the windows are open
 '3-3 ladke karte hai suraksha'skool ke pradhanacharya rameshchand meena skuti surakshit rakhane ko lekar apni pareshaani ginate hai
 He says, 'in three separate innings, i keep three boys under the protection of Scooty
 kya karun 54,000 rupye kii ek skuti he, ek bhi idhar-udhar ho gai to jimmedaari hamaare upar aegi
 'according to the government rule, tribal girls who get 65 percent number get scooty
 chaatraon ne 2015 main aavedan kiya hua he
 Mamta, who applied for Scooty, says that Scooty was to be found when she was 12th pass, reached the final of graduation but Scooty could not be found
 mukhyamantri ke paas vakt nahinhaalanki adhikariyon kaa ab bhi yahi kahana he ki bahut jaldi skuti baant di jaaegi
 About 550 scooties were purchased to distribute scooty to tribal girl students in Jaipur district, but have not been distributed yet
 jila parishad ke adhyaksh moolchand meena kah rahe hai ki hamane 3 baar mukhyamantri ko vakt dene ke liye likhaa he, lekin abhi vakt nahin mila he
 District Council member Beni Prasad Kataria says that on March 23, we had taken up the matter with the girls in a general meeting, when it was said that Scooty would be distributed soon but not distributed till date
 darasal november-disambar main rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 In such a situation, political experts are saying that the BJP would like to organize a grand program to distribute Scooty so that it can be used in political elections
 philhal to janajaatiy chaatraon ko intjaar he ki kab mukhyamantri ko vakt mili or kab unka skuti kaa intjaar khatm ho
 The Delhi Police team has committed three vicious miscreants in the case of burglary
 teen aaropee niraj urf judi, raju or asif ali ko giraftaar kiya he
 All three carried out several theft incidents simply because they wanted to live in a live-in relationship in a nice flat with their girlfriends
 apni tamaam jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye ye log gharon main sendhamari karke chori karne lage
 These accused used to drive e-rickshaws during the day
 din memrikshaw chalaate hueye log un gharon kii reki bhi karte the jahaan raat main inhen vaardaat ko anjaam dena hota tha
 His eyes were more on the houses where less people lived

 Under the leadership of captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, India has undoubtedly achieved great achievements, but when it comes to foreign soil, the figures tell something else
 2007 main tii-20 vishwa cap jeetne se lekar 2011 main vanade kaa vishwa champion bananaa, iske alaava test cricket kii number van team kaa tamgaa paanaa, ye saare yaadgaar lamhen maahi kii captaini main hi aae par in videshi dauron main kuch aisa bhi hota rahaa jo captain kool ke is shandaar kariyar par batta lagaataa he
 Talking about the tours of England, South Africa and Australia, it is as if Mahi's brightness fades
 andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki 2011 world cap main shandaar jeet ke baad bharat ne videshi jameen par ab tak kul 10 test match khele hai jinamein se unhen 9 main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Everyone may have different views on what the definition of a successful captain is, but an accurate assessment of the Kayamabi will only be done after testing your performance abroad
 dhoni kaa record bharat main behad hi shandaar he, lekin jab ve baahar jate hai to unke nijee pradarshan ke saath-saath team kaa parformens bhi gote khaane lagata he
 Under Dhoni's captaincy, Team India won 21 of the 30 Tests at home, with only 3 losses and 6 matches drawn
 lekin jaise hi videshi dharti kii baat aati he, unki safalataa kaa graph kaaphi neeche chalaa jaataa he
 Under Mahi's leadership, India has played a total of 21 matches abroad, winning only 5 matches, losing 10 and losing 6 matches
 in aankadon se saaf andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki videsh main maahi kaa jaadu bilkul bhi nahin chalaa he
 After winning the one-day World Cup, India's performance on foreign soil has become even more lousy, in the 10 Tests played so far, India could only draw one match and in the remaining 9 it had to face it
 aise main dhoni kii test captaini par sawaal uthanaa laazmi he

 71 years ago, India got freedom from slavery, but the country was also broken into two parts
 bharat se katkar muslim bahulya desh pakistan bana jisase hameshaa rishte talkh hi rahe
 Be it infiltration in Kashmir or carrying out terrorist attacks, Pakistan has somehow been responsible for all these
 71 saal pehle jo lakeer aman or shanti ke makasad se khinchi gai thi aaj usee lakeer ke paar jaakar hamaari sena ko sargical strike tak kerani padi
 The talk is 72 years old
 pakistan nayaa-nayaa bana tha
 On one side was Hindustan, on the other side Pakistan and in the middle a small piece of land
 
 
 kashmir
 An independent state
 tabhi 72 saal pehle achaanak ek raat mohammad ali jinna ne kabayaliyon ko mujahidin kaa khitaab dekar unhen kashmir par hamalaa karne bhej diya
 The story starts from there
 72 saal pehle
 a mob attack ended one year, two months, a week and three days later
 jisane badal di jananath kii surat
 Which laid the foundation for Jannat to become Jahannam
 jisane pehali baar mujahidin ko paidaa kiya
 Who wrote a new story of Kashmir
 kareeb 700 saal pehle jis gulistaan ko shamsuddin shah mir ne sinchaa tha
 After them all the Nawabs and kings decorated them
 jisaki astaanon or phijaaon main chinar or guldaar kii khushboo tairti thi
 Which later got the title of Jannat of the land
 vahi kashmir, usee kashmir main aaj se thik sattar saal pehle ek raja kii naadaani or ek hukmran kii manamaani ne phizaon main barood kaa aisa zehar ghola jisaki gandh aaj bhi kashmir main mahasoos kiya ja sakati he
 My country
 tera mulk
 My religion tera mazahab
 My land is your land
 mere log tere log
 This non-human stubbornly first broke a laughing nation into two pieces
 lakhon logon ko mazahab ke naam par maar daalaa gaya or phir us jananath ko bhi jahannam bana diya gaya
 Whose king requested the British to keep his princely state away from hindu-muslim politics with high hopes
 magar unki riyasat kii sarhadon ke nazadik baithe musalamaanon ke liye pakistan banane vaale kaayade aazam mohammad ali jinna kashmir kii is azaadi ke liye taiyaar nahin the
 His argument was that in view of the number of Hindu people in Junagadh, Gujarat, it was merged with India
 usee tarah kashmir main musalamaanon kii aabaadi ke hisaab se us par sirf or sirf pakistan kaa haq he
 To persuade this stubbornness, Jinnah started pressuring Maharaja Hari Singh of Kashmir
 or kashmir ko jane vaali tamaam zaruri chizon kii supplai band kar di
 Pakistan now began to use power to annex Kashmir
 magar maharaja hari singh abhi bhi apane us faisle par kaayam the jo unhone bharat main aakhri waisarai lord mountbeton ko sunaaya tha
 That means free Kashmir
 22 oktober 1947angrezon se mili azaadi ke mahaz 9 hafte baad
 At the behest of Jinnah, thousands of tribesmen carried out the incident in Kashmir on behalf of Pakistan
 jisamen hazaron bekasoor kashmiriyon kaa khun baha
 Women lost their hope
 buudhe bacchon ko bhi nahin bakhsha gaya
 The loot was razed
 makasad tha ki jaise bhi bas kashmir par kabza
 The uniforms of the tribes did not even have an army uniform
 lekin haathon main bandooken
 There were machine guns and mortars
 saaf tha pakistan ne unhen puri taiyaari ke saath bheja tha
 Jinnah gave him the title of Mujahideen to excite the terrorists
 isi josh main kabayaliyon ne muzaffarabad or domel shahar ke bade hisse par kabza bhi kar liya
 He reached Uri close to Srinagar
 jinna ek taraf kashmir par hamalaa karvaa rahe the
 On the other hand, their people started provoking Muslim soldiers to create a revolt in the princely state of Kashmir
 kashmir ke jo musalmaan un kabayaliyon ke saath aae wo to mahfuz rahe
 But those who were against, were killed by the terrorists
 mulk kaa nakshaa badalane kii is jang main ghati khun se laal ho gai
 It has been decided that it is impossible for the Maharaja to save Kashmir
 magar isi bich jinna ke bheje bhaade ke aatankiyon ko lut kii lat lag gai thi
 And he left the mission of Jinnah and went on a mission of plunder
 maharaja harisingh ke saamne ab sirf teen hi raste the
 Let the first thing happen and hand over the princely state of Kashmir to Pakistan
 doosraa un pakistani kabayaliyon se muqabla karen, jo narsanhaar par utaaru the
 Although this did not seem possible for him
 or teesraa or aakhri rasta unke saamne ye tha ki wo bharat se madad len or kashmir ko bachaa len
 But the problem with India was that till then Kashmir was not a part of India and in such a situation the Indian government could not take military action
 kabayalibhon kaa koharaam jari tha
 Maharaj Harisingh could not compete with them alone
 ab saaf lagane laga tha ki unke haath se kashmir to jayega saath hi dogra riyasat kii aan-baan bhi khatm ho jaaegi
 Therefore, to save the Kashmir Valley from Pakistani terrorists, he finally decided to join India with Maharaja Harisingh
 faisla rang laayaa
 The Indian army drove out the enemies
 phir is jang ke aakhri din janm hua elosi kaa
 Immediately after Maharaja Harisingh's decision to accompany Hindustan, the Indian Army opened its front in Kashmir
 raat ke andhere main vimaan ke zarie bharat ne vaqt rahete sena or hathiyaaron ko bina atisi ke diarection ke srinagar main utaar diya
 At that time the invading tribesmen were just a mile from Srinagar
 lihaaza bhartiya sena ne sabase pehle srinagar ke ird gird ek suraksha gheraa banaaya
 After this, the appearance of war did not take long to change
 pahari morche
 Despite weak supplies of munitions and lack of maps, the brave Indian soldiers began to unseat tribal and Pakistani intruders from one place to another
 bhartiya sena ke badhate kadamon kii dhamak ne tab tak kabayaliyon ke dilon main dehshat paidaa kar di thi
 There was a stampede in them
 lihaaja dekhte hi dekhte sena ne baraamula, uri or uske aasapaas ke ilaakon ko waapas kabayaliyon se apane kabze main le liya
 Terrible battle ensued, one by one for every inch of land
 pakistan kii fouj, kashmir ko taaqat ke boote jeetne ai thi
 The Indian Army made it realize that India was much bigger than the Pakistanis not only in size but also in the fortunes
 sena ke javaanon ne ek ke baad ek kabayaliyon or pakistani sena ke kabze vaale ilaakon main unhen maat deni shuru kar di
 Within the next few months of assuming the front, two-thirds of Kashmir was occupied by the Indian Army
 bhartiya fouj jeet kaa paracham laharaa chuki thi
 The issue of Kashmir reached the United Nations after this war, which lasted one week, two months and a week and three days
 jiske baad 5 janvari 1949 ko seez fire kaa elaan kar diya gaya
 It was decided that the forces were in the area at the time of the cease fire
 use hi yuddh viraam rekha mana jaae
 Which today we all call LOC in easy language
 is tarah kashmir kaa kuch hissaa pakistan ke kabje main chalaa gaya
 What is today called Pakistan Occupied Kashmir
 jisamen gilgit, mirpur, mujaffarabad, baltistan shaamil he
 It has been almost 70 years since the incident that injured Kashmir
 magar pakistan abhi bhi apni harkaton se baj nahin aa rahaa he
 The war started from 1947 to occupy the whole of Kashmir
 kashmir ghati main hui is pehali vaardaat ke baad pakistan ne hindustan se teen or ladaaiiyaan ladiin
 But the borders of Kashmir have remained the same since then
 jaisi 1947 kii jang ke baad thim
 Third degree torture of cold has started in Delhi
 guuruuvaar raat palam main nunatam taapmaana 3 degree darj kiya gaya
 On the other hand, in view of severe cold, all the schools in the capital Delhi have been ordered to be closed till 12 January
 pichley teen dinon se dilli kaa taapmaana lagaataar neeche gir rahaa he
 
 or do din pehle adhiktam taapmaana ne 110 saal kaa record tod diya
 There is no hope of relief from this cold outbreak
 dilli main pad rahi kadaake kii thand saalon kaa nahin sadi kaa record todane lagi he
 How much the effect of cold can be gauged by this, that 2 of the night
 30 baje palam main taapmaana 3 degree darj kiya gaya or teen ghante baad saadhe paanch baje bhi 3 degree taapmaana darj kiya gaya jabaki guuruuvaar ko dilli main nunatam taapmaana 4 degree tha or buudhvaar ko 4
 8 degrees
 mausam vibhaag kaa anumaan he ki sardi kaa ye sitam or badhegaa or ravivaar ko paara girakar 2 degree tak pahunch saktaa he

 com / irsmzhpiw4 kaaphi samay se 'rasagulla' ko lekar odisha or pashchim bengal ke bich vivaad chal rahaa tha
 Now this dispute has come to a complete end
 mangalvaar ko aae faisle main rasagulle kii aadhikarik pahchaan pashchim bengal ke naam ho gai he
 Bengal has now got the Geographical Identification (GI) tag for Rasgulla
 is babat pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne bhi twit kar khushi jataai
 Mamta tweeted that happy news for everyone, we are very happy and proud that Bengal has got the tag of geographical identity of Rasgulla
 Sweet news for us all
 We are very happy and proud that # Bengalhas been given GI (geographical Indication) status for Rosogolla — Mamata Banerjee (@mamataofficial) November 14, 2017 Let us know that Rasgulla is a very famous dessert in West Bengal
 lekin iskaa utpaada kahaan se hua is par odisha or pashchim bengal ke bich ladaai chal rahi thi
 The hearing of this case was going on for two years, after which the decision has come today
 kya kiye gaye the daawey?pashchim bengal kii ore se daawa tha ki rasagulla kii ijad unke rajya se hi hua tha
 It was made by the famous sweets maker Naveen Chandra Das before 1868
 lekin maamle jab sabhi kii najaron main aayaa jab odisha kii ore se iske liye tag maanga gaya tha
 On the other hand, Pradeep Kumar, a minister in the Odisha government, had claimed in 2015 that Rasgulla belonged to Odisha
 pichley 600 saal se rasagulla odisha main he
 He also associated it with the offerings of Lord Jagannath
 unka daawa tha ki rasagulla ke istemaal pichley 300 saal se puri kii rathyatra main bhi ho rahaa he
 According to cultural historian Asit Mohanty, 'the tradition of Lord Jagannath offering Rasgulla to Mother Lakshmi at the end of the Rath Yatra is 300 years old
 bengal to khud hi maan rahaa he ki uskaa rasagulla 150 saal purana he
 ' rashtriya pichhadaa varg ayog (enasibisi) ne nau rajyon ke liye pichhadaa varg kii kendriya suchi main jaaton ko shaamil karne ke mudde ko lekar 10 se 13 farvari tak jan sunwaayee karnaa nirdhaarit kiya he
 These nine states include Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, New Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh
 yahaan jari ek aadhikarik vijyapti main kaha gaya ki jan sunwaayee sirifort auditorium main hogi tathaa hitdharakon evam jat samudaay ke sanghon, sanghathanon or vyaktiyon se manch ke samaksh apana paksh prastut karne kaa anurodh kiya gaya he
 The statement said that different times have been set for those opposing the proposal and speaking in favor
 kerala ke vynad jile main ek aadmi kii jabaran nasbandi karaane kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 Here the health officer forcibly sterilized a man
 jiske baad ek gaanv ke logon ne jamkar hangaamaa kiya
 The police have registered a case and started action
 ghatana vynadjile ke pulapalli gaanvaki he
 Chandran, who lives here, was summoned by a junior health inspector of CHC to CHC for some work
 jab chandran vahaan pahunchaa to ek swasth adhikari ne use ek tetanus nirodhak injection lene ke liye kaha
 And after a while, she was sterilized
 police ke mutabik jab us din shaam ko use siechasi se chuttee di gayi tab adhikariyon ne use 1,000 rupee bhi diye
 On reaching home, he felt restless and pain in his private parts after which he went to the CHC again the next day but was not admitted by the authorities
 haalanki siechasi adhikariyon ne daawa kiya he ki chandran ke do bachche hai or usne sahmati patr par khud hastakshar bhi kiye the
 But the victim denied this and said that she was married to a tribal woman who had two children from her first marriage and had left him about nine years ago
 is ghatana ke virodh main kuch gaanv waalon ne swasthya centre par pradarshan kiya
 Because of which the work there was stopped
 jila colector kesavendra kumaar ne pradarshnakariyon ke saath baatcheet kii
 He said that the matter is being investigated
 dm ne bharosa dilaate hue kaha ki jila chikitsa adhikari kii taraf se ek vistrut report aane ke baad kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 However, health officials have claimed that Chandran came to undergo sterilization at his own will
 ab police bhi aage kii karrwai ke liye siemo kii jaanch report kaa intjaar kar rahi he
 -input language jediu ke kai netaaon ne endie main apni pehle kii prabhaavshaalee sthiti behaal karne kii maang kii he jaisaa 2013 main gathbandhan se naata todane se pehle tak uskaa prabhaav tha
 After unprecedented success in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the bjp's base in Bihar is growing and it would not like to allow JDU to get big party status
 raajnneetik vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki kumaar 2019 main 15 loksabhaa siten hasil karne ke liye prayaas kar rahe hai
 In the 2014 general elections, the BJP won 22 of the 40 Lok Sabha seats in the state and its alliance partners LJP and RLSP won six and three seats respectively
 jadyu tab keval do siten jeet saki thi
 There was a time in Bollywood, when viewers started watching, recognizing and teasing the villains with a genuinely negative attitude after watching movies
 yah khalanaayak kii apni damdaar bhoomika kaa kamaal tha, jiskaa shrey kam hi mil paata tha
 Because films were often considered to be hero-heroine and the award shows only the best actor, actress and film
 lambey samay se filmon main khalanaayak kii ahmiyat ko darja nahin mila
 However, many changes were seen with the changing times and today the hero is seen playing the role of villain
 film jagat main ek dashak se zyada samay se patrakarita kar rahe fajaale gupran ne bollywood ke khalnaayakon ke safar par ‘main hum khalanaayak' pustak likhi he, jisamen unhone 101 se adhik khalnaayakon ke jivan va kariyar main utaar-chadhaav ke bare main vyakt kiya he
 Fazle Gufran went back 40–50 years to find villains alive in his book that people have forgotten in today's time
 ‘main hum khalanaayak' main fajaale gupran ne 352 pannon ke jariye khalnaayakon kii prishthbhumi, jivan, sangharsh or safalataa ke bare main vistrut rup se jaankaree di he
 In fact, the importance of Villain's role has increased immensely in today's times
 filmon main jab hero se lekar nirdeshak tak khalanaayak kaa kirdaar nibhaana shuru kar de, to samaj lijie ki filmein sirf hero-heroin kii nahin, balki khalanaayak kii bhi he
 Gufran spoke about all the villains like Pran, Amrish Puri, Prem Chopra, Gulshan Grover, Danny, Amjad Khan, Kader Khan, Kulbhushan Kharbanda, Sadashiv Amrapurkar, Shakti Kapoor, Premnath, Jeevan, Raza Murad
 itnaa hi nahin, aaj ke daur main villen banane kii hode main shaamil hone vaale abhinaytaon ke naam bhi ginaae
 Shah Rukh Khan, John Abraham, Aamir Khan, Sonu Sood, Vivek Oberoi, Ajay Devgan, Akshay Kumar, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Ranveer Singh etc
 also added more sparkle to their performances with Negative Active
 ‘mistar india' film main amrish puri dwaara ‘mogambo', film ‘shaan' main kulbhushan kharbanda kaa ‘shaakaal', ‘sholay' film main amjad khan kaa ‘gabbar' kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa gaya
 Which will always be remembered in the history of Bollywood
 fajaale gupran ne yah bhi darshaya ki khalnaayakon kaa asar sirf abhinayta yaa nirmaataaon par hinahin padaa, balki filmon ke naam par bhi dekha gaya
 Films like Shatrughan Sinha's 'kalicharan', Aamir Khan's 'ghajini', Akshay Kumar's 'gabbar Singh' were also named after villains
 ek khalanaayak kii bhoomika main na jane kitne kirdaar bollywood main dekhe ja chuke hai or aage bhi dekhe jane hai
 Gufran has shown the importance of his character in his book 'main Hoon Khalnayak' apart from the celebrity who plays the villain in Bollywood
 khalanaayak ke vibhinn rup ko apane pannon main rekhaankit kiya he
 Gujran's book 'main Hoon Khalnayak' is a great way to know about the villains from the old times till now
 assam ke 11 baadh prabhavit jilon main brahmaputra nadi kii dhara main lagaataar aa rahe utaar ke kaaran upree or nichle assam main baadh kii sthiti main sudhaar hua
 However, the Brahmaputra in the Barak valley continues to swell in the Sahayak river, causing displacement of five lakh people
 adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki kuch sthanon par brahmaputra nadi abhi bhi khatre ke nishaan ke upar bah rahi he lekin pichley kuch dinon se rajya main barish main aayi kami ke kaaran jalastr mengiravat kaa rujhaan he
 Officials said flood waters are now coming out of homes and accounts in affected districts like Lakhimpur, Dhemaji, Dibrugarh, Sivsagar, Jorhat, Golaghat, Morigaon, Sonitpur, Dhubri, Gwalpara and Barpeta
 baharhaal, dibrugarh, golaghat main numaligarh, guwahati, jorhat main nimatighat, morigaanv main dharmtool or majuli main brahmaputra abhi bhi khatre ke nishaan se upar bah rahi he
