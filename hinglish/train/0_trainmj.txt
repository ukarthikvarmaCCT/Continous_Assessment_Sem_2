 However the second type of leadership can be taught
 management skulon ne netaaon ko aankane ke liye kai praaroop taiyaar kiye hai
 Their adopted methods for this are also effective outside
 himmat, safagoi, samaj, vinamrata or ichhashakti jaisi khaasiyaten kisi company ko chalaane ke liye jitani ahm hai, utani hi desh chalaane ke liye bhi
 It is not that our politicians do not have any of these qualities of leadership

 Delhi Pradesh Congress President Ajay Maken has accused the Delhi government of criminal negligence

 The probability of a monsoon is expected in Delhi on 29 June
 lihaaja emsidi se lekar peedblyoody tak sabhi civik agency aapasi talmail se 15 june tak sabhi chote-bade naalon kii safai karti hai
 According to the PWD, 30 per cent of the desilting markings hit the Kejriwal government, citing data of July 5 uploaded on the PWD website
 darasal peedblyoody ke 5 july ke aankadon ke mutabik kareeb 1,005 peedblyoody kii sadakon main se sirf 311 sadakon par puri tarah dicilting kaa kaam hua he
 That is, till July 5, only 30% desilting was done, which is the failure of the government
 jhuthe daawey kar rahi he dilli sarkaarmakan ne ye bhi aarope lagaaya ki jin sadakon kii puri dicilting kaa daawa sarkaar kar rahi he wo bhi puri tarah saaf nahin hoga
 Because the work has been completed by 5 July, the silt that is released is dried only after the silt colloading trains are transported to the dumping zone, but it starts to rain around 5 July
 aise main jo silt kinare rakhaa hota he wo barish ke pani ke saath waapas naalon main chalaa jaataa he
 That is why the claim of the Delhi government cannot be completely believed

 yah madhyakaalin kshatrapon kii jang jaisaa maamla ban gaya he
 Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Chandrababu Naidu and Chief Minister of Telangana
 chandrashekhar raav kuch usee andaaj main ek-duusare ke sansadhano ko hadapney kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Whether it is about electricity, water, money, employees or office space, both seem to be the only way for charges and counter-allegations
 ve bacchon kii tarah rajyapal i
 s
 el
 They reach Narsimhan with a complaint
 sansadhano ke bantwaare kii ruparekha banane main ek-duusare kaa pakshpaat saaf najar aa rahaa he
 The two are accusing each other of grossly neglecting certain provisions in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act
 unka makasad prashasnic logon kii bhaawanaaon ko bhunaane ke saath-saath vot bank ko bachaae rakhana bhi he
 The truth is that both states are struggling with money strait
 donon ne ek-ek lakh karod ru
 Has presented a budget of Rs
 But both of them do not know from where they will raise this much money
 ve centre kii ore ummid bhari najaron se dekh rahe hai taaki unhone chunavi ghoshnaa main jo vaade kiye the, unhen puraa kiya ja sake
 But neither money nor other assets or resources were appraised at the time of partition, nor employees
 sansadhano ke aankadon kii kami or nakad paise kii puri jaankaree na hone se jhagade ho rahe hai
 The most bizarre fight is over the money from the undivided Andhra Pradesh Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board
 rajya kii is sabase amir sanstha ke paas 1,400 karod ru
 Huh
 telugana kaa daawa he ki andhra pradesh ke adhikariyon ne board ke khate se kaaphi paisa chupake se hastantarit kar diya he
 On October 30, on the complaint of its officials, the police took into custody a senior Andhra Pradesh official
 jin adhikariyon par aapraadhik maamle darj hue hai, naidu unke paksh main utar pade hai or unhone aise kisi hastantaran se inkaar kiya he
 Thousands of crores in various institutions
 jamaa hai, jinka bantwaaraa 58
 32: 41
 6:8 ke anupaat main hona he
 The process of money sharing has not started due to no bureaucratic bifurcation
 iees, ipies or bhartiya van seva adhikariyon kaa bantwaaraa november ke ant tak ho paaegaa
 The division of staff at the lower level will be completed by next summer
 aise main prashasan main niskriyata he
 The situation will worsen if Rao and Naidu do not come together at the table of agreement
 donon krishna nadi ke pani bantwaare ke mudde ko kendriya jal sansaadhan mantri uma bharti ke paas le gaye hai
 Rao claims, "the Center is expected to fully implement the provisions of the Reorganization Commission but is not cooperating with Telangana
" vah to rajya se badale kii bhaavana se kaam kar rahaa he
 Telangana says that Andhra Pradesh has drawn 6,200 crore cubic feet (TMC) of water from the Pothireddypadu head regulator from July 1 to October 31 when it was allowed only 34 TMC
 sinchai mantri tii
 Says Harish Rao, "it is official data that Andhra Pradesh has taken 92 TMC of water, besides it has also taken a lot of water from the handri-neeva project
 ’’ vahiin naidu kaa aarope he ki telugana krishna nadi prabandhan board ke adeshon kaa ulanghan kar rahaa he
 Says Naidu, "the situation was very fragile this season due to the 78 TMC water in the river, but Telangana was very diligently preparing power at the Srisailam Left Bank Power House and throwing water into the sea
" ’’ naidu ise gaiyr kanoonee bataa rahe hai
 His state submitted the report to the Center on 7 November
 pani ko lekar vivaad bada mudda banataa ja rahaa he, donon rajyon main sardi kaa mausam isi mudde par garmane kii ummid he
 The Narendra Modi-led central government has taken a major decision on the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Atrocities Prevention Act (SC / ST Act)
 sarkaar isi monsoon satr main SC / ST sanshodhan vidheyak laaegi
 Through this, the government is preparing to play big bets
 modi sarkaar ne badlaavon ko manjuuri bhi de di he
 The government wants to play the front footer on the Dalit issue brought about by the amendment bill
 SC / ST sanshodhan vidheyak ko sarkaar isi sansad satr main laaegi
 While there is only one week left for the monsoon session to end
 modi sarkaar is bill ke jariye dalit mudde par raajnneetik dalon kii asaliyat logon ke saamne rakhana chaahati he
 Because it will be clear which parties are with Dalits and against which party
 sarkaar ke ranneetikaron kii maane to kai vipakshi dal is bill par rajyasabha main adnga daal sakate hai
 In such a situation, the government will have a good chance to surround the opposition
 bataa den ki supreme court kii do jajon kii bench ne isi saal march menessi / asti act main badlaavaka faisla diya tha
 In which the Supreme Court had said that a preliminary inquiry should be done before registering an FIR in the SC / ST case
 abhiyukt kii giraftaar karne ke liye purv anumati leni hogi
 In addition, Section 438 of the CRPC will apply to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Prevention of Atrocities Act
 supreme court ke is faisle se desh kii raajnneeti main bhuuchaal aa gaya
 On April 2, Dalit organizations took to the streets against the decision
 dalit samudaay ne do april ko 'bharat band' kiya tha
 The central government was scorched in the heat of protest
 deshbhar main hue dalit andolan main kai ilaakon main hinsa hui thi, jisamen ek darjan logon kii maut ho gai thi
 After this, the Modi government had assured that the government will file a review petition in the court to hear the case again
 rivyuu patishan ke baad bhi supreme court ke faisle main koi badlaav nahin aata hai to sarkaar sansad main SC / ST sanshodhan vidheyak laakar supreme court ke faisle ko badalakar puraane or mul swarup main behaal karegi
 The Modi government filed a review petition in the matter and since then the matter is in court
 iske baad pradhanmantri ke nirdesh par is maamle main ek mantri samuh kaa gathan kiya
 It included Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Ram Vilas Paswan, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Thawar Chand Gehlot
 dalit sanghathanon ne modi sarkaar ko ek baar phir ultimatum de rakhaa he ki agar 9 agast tak essi asti act ko puraane swaroop main laane vaala kanoon nahin bana to wo bade paimaane par virodh pradarshan karenge
 The issue came to a head when MP Chirag Paswan, the son of Ram Vilas Paswan, wrote a letter to the Modi government on behalf of the nda's ally LJP
 essi asti act ko puraane swaroop ke liye bill laae yaa phir adhyadesh laae nahin to unki party 9 agast ko dalit sena dwaara bharat band main shaamil hogi
 Chirag Paswan even said that he can take a big decision if needed
 chiraag kii maangon ko jediu ne bhi samarthan kiya tha
 The parties of the opposition also decided where the government should take it
 sutron kii maane to modi sarkaar ne is puure maamle main ek ground report ke aadhaar par manthan ke baad essi asti act main sanshodhan karke puraane swaroop main laane kaa faisla kiya he
 In fact, on 9 August, during the 'bharat Bandh', the damage to life and property was once blamed on the Modi government
 iske saath hi vipakshi modi sarkaar kii chhavi dalit virdohi banane kii koshish karte
 According to Chirag Paswan, even if the LJP were to join this India, the unity of the NDA would have been questioned, which would not be good for the Modi government and the BJP
 iske baad hi sarkaar ne sanshodhan ke liye kadam aage badaye hai
 Following this move by the government, LJP President and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan tweeted, "the cabinet under the Prime Minister took a historic decision to make significant changes to the SC / ST Act 1989 and put it in place before the Supreme Court's March 20, 2018 decision
" Will be restored
 modi sarkaar sanshodhan bill ko sansad ke dono sadano main paas karaane main kaamyaab rahati hai to is saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav or 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main laabh mil saktaa he
 Through this, the BJP will try to give a message among the Dalits that the Modi government is not anti-dalit but Dalit friendly
 matlab saaf hai ki is mudde par sarkaar ke dono haanthon main laddu lekar chal rahi he

 darasal in yuvakon ko jis gaadi se takkar lagi, us par neeli batti to thi hi, gaadi ke andar se bhi sharaab kii bottlen baraamad hui hai
 More than 1,200 people in Bihar have consumed jail air due to the stringent police law enforcement ban
 police ne na jane kitne hajaar chaape maare, lakhon litre sharaab jabt kii lekin ek maamle main yah kanoon laachaar najar aa rahaa he
 The matter is connected to the judiciary, so the police are also constantly covering the matter

 Not only this, after the accident, the driver of the car got injured and the rider absconded, then it was found that on the back seat of the car, an empty bottle of liquor was kept with mineral water and some food items
 jaahir he chalati gaadi main sharaab pine kaa kaarykram chal rahaa tha, lekin durghatana hone kii vajah se yah baat bhi saamne aa gai

 The picture of bottles that went viral on social media, was seen trying to crack the police incident
 police is baat se inkaar kar rahi he ki gaadi main sharaab thi
 When its picture in the social media was violated, the police gave a ridiculous statement that petrol was recovered from the vehicle, not bottles of liquor
 police kaa kahana he ki isaki jaanch kii ja rahi he
 However, there is no mention of the bottle of liquor in the FIR in the FIR
 ab sawaal uthta he ki kya gaadi ke pichhali seat par baitha aadmi sharaab kii jagah petrol pi rahaa tha
 They are getting up, the police have launched a campaign against liquor ban in Sawalbihar

 Officially, the police claim that they cannot take any action without a formal complaint
 lekin yon utpeedan ke maamalon main police ko khud se karrwai karne kaa adhikaar he
 "there is a lot of pressure on the police to speed up investigations and suppress sensitive issues," said an official
 isliye jin varisht adhikariyon ko in donon ghatnaon ke bare main bataaya gaya tha, ve bhi is par chup hai
 In fact, the female officer has received indications not to pursue the case

 bayaan ke anusaar maansik rup se biimaar updravi trump ne haal hi main sanyukt raashtra aam sabha ke dauraan ajeeb bakawaas kii thi ki wo diarpike ko puri tarah se khatm kar denge
 Let me tell you that Trump had previously warned Kim Jong that Kynorth Correa is afraid of ending his nuclear weapon program
 saath hi trump ne ye bhi kaha tha ki trump suicide mishan par he
 Significantly, recently, US President Donald Trump tweeted about North Korea that 'kim is crazy who does not care about his people
 trump ke anusaar is baar is pagal ko sabak jarur sikhaaya jayega
 Also this time he will have to face such a test like never before

 BJP cut the ticket of sitting MP Kirit Somaiya from Mumbai North East Lok Sabha seat
 unhen is seat se phir se sambhavit ummidavaar mana ja rahaa tha, lekin iskaa shivasena virodh kar rahi thi
 BJP has given ticket to BMC Councilor Manoj Kotak from this seat
 ab is seat par manot kotak kii ladaai ensipi ke sanjay dina patil se hogi
 Speaking to Aaj Tak after cutting the ticket, Kirit Somaiya said that if i have to give up my seat for a big possibility, then i am very happy and proud that i got a chance to do such a big job for the party
 
 party ne hameshaa mujhe samarthan dikhaaya he
 i knew this was coming
 aam aadmi, party ke log, media har koi jaanata tha ki pichley kuch maheenon se kya ho rahaa he
 On the Shiv Sena pressure question, Kirit Somaiya said that everyone knew what was happening
 party ne bahut koshish kii
 i am proud if i had to sacrifice one seat for 48 seats in Maharashtra and i did so with pleasure
 shivasena ke liye raily yaa prachaar karne ke sawaal par somaiya ne kaha ki dobaaraa modi sarkaar banane ke liye party jo kuch bhi karne ke liye kahegi, main use khushi se karuunga

 unke raajnneetik kariyar kii shuruyaat mere or mere kaaran hui
 He is a good leader and will do better than me
 vah record voton se jeetenge
 Let me tell you, BJP is contesting three seats out of the six seats in the metropolis and Somaiya is the only BJP MP here whose ticket has been cut
 baaki teen siton par bhaajapa kii gathbandhan sahyogi shivasena chunaav lard rahi he
 Shiv Sena leaders were opposing the re-nomination of Somaiya due to comments against his party chief Uddhav Thackeray
 saal 2017 main bhaajapa or shivasena ne jab biemasi chunaav alag-alag ladaa tha to somaiya ne apni ek tippanee main ‘‘bandra kaa mafia’’ shabd kaa istemaal kiya tha
 His remarks were linked to Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray
 uddhav thakare mumbai ke bandra sthit apane awaas ‘‘matoshri’’ main rahete hai
 Shiv Sena activists had threatened that they would not campaign for the BJP if Somaiya was re-nominated from the Mumbai North East constituency
 shivasena netaa sunil raut ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki yadi somaiya ko dobaaraa tikat diya gaya to vah unke khilaaf nirdaleey ummidavaar ke rup main chunaav ladenge

 i like Modi ji and stand in support of him
 main amar singh hum or mere naam kii jo bhi haisiyat he, vah yogi or modi ke liye he na ki buaa (basapa supremeo mayawati) or babua (sapa mukhiya akhilesh yadav) ke liye'

 So they do not want to engage with any one region and want to travel all over Uttar Pradesh and if possible, the whole country

 After which there was speculation in political circles that he could join BJP

 i will not say that i will not join the BJP if given the chance, but who is giving me a chance

 inaki rajnatik dukaanon main karodon rupee main candidet bikate hai, wo candidet jo duusare candidet ke liye kaam karte hai, wo candidet jo duusare candidet kaa prachaar karte hai, wo candidet jo duusare candidet ke vot katate hai
 They become the secret weapon of big leaders and big parties
 aisi 1900 se zyada anjaani partiyaan hai, jo chunaav kii mausam main apni dukaane kholkar baith jaati hai
 According to Election Commission rules, a candidate can spend a maximum of Rs 16 lakh in campaigning in a state assembly election
 ummidavaar ko prachaar ke liye 10 gadiyon kii ijaajat hoti he or har booth par do poling agent milte hai
 From the dummy candidates, the main candidate gets double spending, double carts and double polling agents in the campaign
 iske alaava aksar dami candidet ke jariye ummidavaar apane virdohi ummidavaar ke vot main send lagaate hai
 The dummy candidate is caught only when someone else's election material or flag is recovered from his car
 vidhansabha chunaav ladane ke liye sirf 10 hajaar rupee kii jamaanat raashi hoti he
 No one is barred from contesting elections, so leaders often resort to dummy candidates
 ye dami nirdaleey bhi ho sakate hai or chunaav ayog main registerd kisi anjaane dal ke bhi ho sakate hai
 In the last assembly elections in UP, 403 seats were contested by candidates from a total of 223 parties
 ek anumaan ke mutabik upi main pichley chunaav main kam se kam 2 hajaar dami candidet khadey kiye gaye the
 Once the preparations for the UP elections are going on, shops selling dummy candidates have opened
 kaise ye dukaane chalaane vaale dami candidet bech rahe hai or ek-ek dami candidet kaa rate kya he? ye chaunkaane vaala khulaasa aap pard sakate hai-vasi ahamed-suniye, dami kii baat ye he ki meraa dal doosraa bhi registerd he
 I'll make him a dummy
 'rashtriya awami dal' se
 That sign is also mine
 reporter-doosraa koun sa dal he, bataaya aapane?vasi ahamed-'rashtriya awami dal', uskaa bhi rashtriya adhyaksh main hi hum
 Reporter - is it registered with the Election Commission? Wasi Ahmed - Yes, registered
 vasi ahamed ol india muslim majalis naam ke sanghathan ke rashtriya sanyojak bareli ke rahane vaale hai
 But in the UP elections, he reached Delhi to do a dummy candidate deal
 'aaj tak' kii special team khud ko upi ke liye ek rajnatik dal kaa chunavi campan karne vaala bataakar inase dilli main mili to vasi ne 'rashtriya awami dal' naam kii apni ek party kaa khulaasa kar diya
 Reporter - 'national Voice Party'
 kab karwaai thi?vasi ahamed-ye 2002 main
 Reporter - By the same name? Wasi Ahmed - Yes, 'rashtriya Awami Dal' Reporter - But in this name, have you ever fought an election on 'rashtriya Awami Dal'? Wasi Ahmed - Yes, in 2002, Assembly election 10
 reporter-10 seat se?vasi ahamed-haa, ladaa die the
 reporter-up? Wasi ahmed-up, from your prayers
 vasi ahamed rashtriya awami dal ke naam par 2002 main 10 seat se dami candidet utaar chuke hai, jo duusare dalon ke ummidavaaron ke liye chunavi phayda karaane ke liye ladvaae gaye the
 After counting the benefits of the dummy candidate, Wasi Ahmed started to deal
 reporter-thodaa sa meri jaankaree ke liye bataa do ki dami ke phaayde kya kya hote hai?vasi ahamed-dami ke phaayde ye hote hai, dami kii gaadiyaan lag jaati hai
 The dummy's man gets protection
 varkar wo unheen kaa hota he
 Security, carrying carts, some candidates from that budget showed the expenses here
 reporter-acha
 Ten people in 'rashtriya Awami Dal' UP will not even know the name of this party
 lekin chunaav ayog main ye party registerd he or jab chunaav aate hai to ye duusare candidet ke phaayde ke liye apni dukaane khol kar baith jate hai
 There are many such faces, there are many unknown political parties, who are engaged in the dirty game of politics before the UP elections
 ek rajesh bharti hai
 He also has his own political shop
 swarashtra jan party ke naam se, jiske ye adhyaksh hai
 Rajesh Bharti of Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh got his party registered in the Election Commission in 2011
 chunaav ke liye dami candidet kaa dhandha tab se chal rahaa he
 Rajesh Bharti - He will put his party's flag, not his party's flag
 wo apana poster lagayegaa, apane naam par paas legaa gaadi kaa
 He will roam on his own, now what he talks about while walking in the society, he will tell you
 lekin chalegaa wo pratyaashee apni party kaa
 Reporters - that's what they are saying
 rajesh bharti -prachaar karne ko prachaar karegaa
 The Special Investigation Team to date has caught many electoral businessmen like Rajesh Bharti, who is particularly active during the election season and lives in the hope that a big political party or a candidate will deal with them with a dummy candidate
 ek shaarik osmani 'apana desh party' naam ke rajnatik dal ke kartadharta or is dal ke pashchimi uttar pradesh ke prabharee hai
 In our conversation, they turned out to be the dummy candidate's master of secret dirty games
 shaarik osmani- har tarah kii planning he aadmi ke paas
 Brother, there are two things nowadays, now that the environment is going on, first of all you can buy everything with money, secondly your policy should be such that how will you put your mind in your mind that it will Say it
 shaarik osmani 2017 ke upi chunaav main hamaare candidet ko phayda pahunchane ke liye apni party se dami candidet utaarne ko taiyaar the
 But the amount they asked for it was shocking
 shaarik osmani-kam se kam jaise 20 candidet ho gaye
 10 to 12 crores, at least the expenses will come
 20 candidet main kam se kam
 Reporter - How much? Shariq Usmani - Come on at least 10 crores
 reporter-10 lakh?shaarik osmani-10 karod
 The cost of 10 to 12 crore rupees to remove 20 candidates
 yani har dami candidet ke liye kam se kam 50 lakh rupee kaa rate
 Every shop in Netagiri has a different rate
 party kaa naam kisi ne naa suna ho ummidavaar khadey karke phayda pahunchaana
 The open game of election business is going on
 'aaj tak' kii team ne upi chunaav main dami candidet kaa dhandha karne vaale ek or shaks ko pakadaa
 The name Rajesh Kumar Kushwaha, who describes himself as the vice-president of a political party called 'bharat Rakshak Kranti Party'
 jab upi chunaav ke liye dami candidet kii baat hui to rajesh khud dami candidet banane ke liye taiyaar ho gaye
 The most surprising thing is that the net of these political shops is spread everywhere
 ye kahin bhi kisi bhi ilaake se kisi bhi seat se chunaav main dami candidet khadey kar dene kaa daawa karte hai
 The Bigg Boss house started with the title song of the film 'lakshya'
 subah ek baar phir ghar ke kaamon ko lekar nitibha kii ladaai manavir or mona se ho gai
 Being the captain of the house, Manveer decided that if there are less utensils in the kitchen, more cleanliness will be maintained
 iske liye unhone sirf aath plate chhod baaki store room main rakh die lekin nitibha ne is par aapatti jataai or sari platen waapas le ain
 Nitibha said that he should convert everyone to work, but he cannot take decisions on behalf of everyone
 baad main manavir or mona se baatcheet ke dauraan manu kehete hai ki reality sho or industry kaa pichley das saalon se hissaa hone ke baavjood usamen confidence kii kami he or vah apane puure potential kaa istemaal kabhi nahin karti he
 In the evening, 'bigg Boss' introduced the Solar System task for Ticket to Finale
 is task ke liye garden aria main tikat tu phinale rakhaa gaya tha jiske chaaro taraf gharavaalon ko grahon kii tarah ghoomana tha
 The householders had to walk while saving their water and trying to spill water of others
 har level par ek sadsy ko game se baahar hona tha or har level ke baad baaki bache sadasyon ko apane-apane boul main pani bharkar upar vaale orbit par chalanaa shuru karnaa tha
 Lopamudra was ranked first in the ranking task so he started from the second orbit
 vahiin puure sijan ke liye nominated rohan ko task kaa sanchaalak banaaya gaya
 Mona dropped out of the task due to having a body pen after running for a long time after the task started
 agle round main lopamudra ne join kiya lekin aate hi unhone ghoshnaa kar di ki jo unka pani giraayega vah uskaa task kharaab kar dengi
 After a while, Lopa's shoe laces opened which she started trying to tie but Manveer and Manu said that she could not stop
 gusse main lopa tej chalane lageen or kuch der baad funskar gir gayi
 However, Lopa did not take his defeat in a positive way
 manavir ne unase poocha ki chot to nahin lagi to vah kehane lageen ki unhen kya fark padataa he
 And she started blaming others that she was not allowed to tie when the laces opened, so she fell
 vah bani ke khilaaf bhi coment karne lageen
 In the next round, Nitibha slipped and Manu, Manveer and Bani survived the task
 iske baad manu or manavir ne bani ko giraane kaa plan banaaya
 Manu said that he would follow Bani and drop his bowl
 haalanki 'big bos' ne task ke din kii avadhi khatm hone kii ghoshnaa kar di
 All three started practicing late at night, while Manu said that he was working hard for captaincy more than Ticket to Finale
 kal ke episod main ham dekhenge ki bani ne gusse main apana boul phenk dengi or manu-manavir tikat tu phinale ke daavedaar ban jaaenge
 Later, during a conversation with Manveer and Mona, Manu says that despite being a part of the reality show and industry for the last ten years, it lacks confidence and never uses its full potential
 shaam ko tikat tu phinale ke liye 'big bos' ne solar system task introdeus kiya
 For this task, a ticket to finale was kept in the garden area, around which the families had to roam like planets
 gharavaalon ko apana pani bachaate hue or dusron kaa pani giraane kii koshish karte hue chalanaa tha
 At each level, one member had to be out of the game and after each level the remaining members had to fill their respective bowls and start walking on the top orbit
 lopamudra ko ranking task main pehali rank mili thi isliye unhone duusare orbit se chalanaa shuru kiya
 For the entire season, Nominated Rohan was made the task manager
 task shuru hone ke baad kaaphi der tak chalane ke baad body pen hone kii vajah se mona task se baahar ho gayi
 In the next round, Lopamudra joined, but on arrival, he announced that the one who would drop his water would spoil his task
 kuch der baad lopa ke juute kaa les khul gaya jise baandhne kii koshish karte hue vah rukne lageen lekin manavir or manu ne kaha ki vah ruk nahin sakati hai
 Angry Lopa started walking fast and after some time she got trapped
 haalanki lopa ne apni haar ko sakaaratmak tareeke se nahin liya
 Manveer asked her that if she was not hurt, she started saying what difference it made to her
 or vah dusron ko dosha dene lageen ki les khulne par unhen baandhne nahin diya gaya isliye vah gir gayi
 She also started commenting against Bani
 agle round main nitibha phisalkar gir gayi or manu, manavir or bani hi task main batch gaye
 After this Manu and Manveer made a plan to topple Bani
 manu ne kaha ki vah bani ke peeche chalenge or unka boul gira denge
 However, 'bigg Boss' announced the end of the day of the task
 der raat teenon practice karne lage, vahiin manu ne kaha ki vah tikat tu phinale se zyada captaini ke liye mehnat kar rahe the
 In tomorrow's episode we will see that Bani will angrily throw her bowl and manu-manveer will become the contender for Ticket to Finale

 He said, i told him that even if he spends 10 percent of his time on solving the West Asia issue, the Kashmir issue between the two countries will be resolved
 unhone kaha ki clinton ne tab vaada kiya tha, lekin uske baad chijen badal gayi
 Nawaz Sharif said, Pakistan had raised its concern (concern about Kashmir) in United Nations General Assembly and was praised by the world
 ek baar phir america kii apni aadhikarik yatra ke dauraan main is sandesh ko phir se doharaaoongaa
 Although Pakistan is keen that the US intervene, the US has said many times that India and Pakistan should determine the 'pace, scope and nature' of their negotiations

 He was quoted as saying, the situation can become dangerous
 bharat ke paas parmaanu bam he, hamaare paas bhi he, bharat prakshepastra viksit karata he, ham bhi karte hai

 ham sabhi ko is par vichaar karnaa chahie
 He also said that he would also raise the issue of US drone strikes during his meeting with Obama
 obama or sharif kii mulaakaat ke dauraan afghanistan mudde ke alaava jin anya pramukh muddon par charchaa hogi, unamem bharat-pakstan sambandh shaamil rahane kii ummid he

 It is being told that in the Ayodhya case, the lawyers of the Muslim side have issued a statement saying that we do not approve any arbitration

 "let me tell you that on Wednesday, when the final hearing was going on, the Arbitration Committee constituted in this case submitted its report to the Supreme Court

 ise congress or bijepi kaath kii handi bataakar khaarij karti hai
 Doubts have been raised about its practical form and persistence
 lekin yadi kshetreey partiyon ke netaaon se baat karen, khaskar un 17 partiyon se jo buudhvaar ko talkatoraa stadium main manch par maujuud thim, to zyaadaatar yahi maanate hai ki teesraa morcha ek aisa vichaar he jiske kaaryrup lene kaa samay aa gaya he
 Both national parties have their own reasons behind rejecting the Third Front
 adarsh rup main to bijepi yahi chaahati he ki vah centre main congress party kaa ekmaatr vikalp bane
 The party sees the rise of any other capable alternative as a threat that could dent the anti-congress votes
 bijepi ke purv adhyaksh venkaiya naidu ne kaha, “yah ek aisa prayog he jo baar-baar vifal rahaa he or yah hone vaala nahin he
 The Congress party also looks at the 'third Front' with a lot of skepticism
 kisi sakasham vikalp ke ubharne se congress ke ‘secular vot bank’ main send lagati he kyonki yah un logon ko ek vikalp muhaiyaa karata he jo bijepi kii rajnatik soch ke virdohi hai
 The third front or any other option involves mostly regional parties
 yah dekhte hue ki congress akhil bhartiya str par upasthiti vaali ekmaatr party he, kshetreey partiyaan congress party kii keemat par hi ubhar sakati hai
 Two incidents in two consecutive days in the past week have forced analysts and political observers to focus on the possible rise of a non-congress, non-bjp alliance at the Center
 mangalvaar ko bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne rajya main party ke ek sammelan main prabhavi dakhal dete hue suniyojit tareeke se bijepi ke pradhanmantri ummidavaar narendra modi kii bakhiya udhedi
 The very next day, the leaders of 17 regional parties came to the stage for the first time after many years, giving rise to the emergence of the Third Front
 aise log kshetreey or choti partiyon ke ubharate manch ko donon rashtriya partiyon kaa sakasham vikalp maan sakate hai jo narendra modi jaise jabardast brands kii raajnneeti se prabhavit nahin hai tathaa upie sarkaar ke bhrashtachar evam aakshamata or vyapak taur par congress party evam khaskar rahul gandhi dwaara narendra modi ke netritv main chalaae ja rahe abhiyaan ko chunauti de paane main vifaltaa se kupit hai
 There is a habit of destroying oneself in the Third Front, a crisis on co-existence
 dhyaan rahe ki tisare morche kii koi bhi sarkaar apana kaarykaal nahin puraa kar pai, jisaki vajah se iske ban paane or kisi sambhavit prayog ke liye tik paane ko lekar bada sawaal khadaa hota he
 It is also a matter of increasing difficulty that the ambitions of regional leaders keep on shaking
 netritv kaa sawaal hameshaa hi jad jamaaye rahata he or isi vajah se pehle akasar aise prayog dharashayi ho gaye
 Jp or v
 pi
 In the absence of a central figure like Singh, leaders of most regional parties see themselves as potential prime ministers, and this is a potential hurdle that leads to the possibility of the Third Front moving forward
 aage kya hoga iskaa sanket is baat se hi samajha ja saktaa he ki bheed main maujuud sapa samarthakon kaa ek varg lagaataar mulaayam singh ke pradhanmantri banane ke bare main naare laga rahaa tha
 This led many people present in the meeting to wonder whether the leaders of the Third Front had taken any lessons from their previous mistakes
 yah tathy to he ki jedy (you), sapa, vam morcha, biju janata dal (bijedy), jedy (es), eiediemke, rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi), jharkhand vikaas morcha-prajatantric (jeviem) or assam gana parishad (agypi) jaisi vividh partiyon ke netaa manch par ek saath aae
 It is worth noting that four of these regional parties — JD (U), AIADMK, JVM and AGP — were part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) from 1998 to 2004 and the NCP is still a part of the UPA
 lekin argedy, algepi, bispi, tiemasi or diemke jaisi partiyon kii anupasthiti ne yah baat ujagar kar di he ki manch ko aage kis tarah ke antarvirodhon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Some regional and small parties are also not going to accept each other
 sapa or bispi ek saath nahin aa saktin or na hi diemke or eidmke yaa vam morcha or tiemasi, argedy or jedy (you)
 The regional parties believe that if there is any hope of coming to power, the only way for them to come under a banner is that there is no such thing as an ideology connecting them
 lekin in partiyon main chunaav purv kisi samjhaute kii gunjaaish kam hi dikh rahi he
 The proof of this is that these parties are not ready to give up even one seat to other parties in their area of influence
 yah unke sah-astitv par ek gambhir sawaal khadey karata he
 On occasion, none of the parties united in the name of secularism said that they would not join BJP or Congress alliance
 agar siyaasi halaat badal jaaen to secularism ke prati apni patibaddhta ke baavjood eidmke or biju janata dal ko bijepi se haath milaane main koi hichkichaahat nahin hogi
 Similarly, JD (U) and JD (S) can ally with Congress
 sabko maaloom he ki kshetreey netaaon ko avasar kii talash he or is dauraan ve secularism kii aad lekar apane pattey chhupaae rakhana chaahate hai
 The prospective third front has decided its own practicality
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kehete hai, “jahaan tak sambhav ho or jitani zyada partiyon tak sambhav ho, hamen ek saath rahanaa chahie
 "but for this to happen, the leaders of the proposed front will not only have to control their ambitions but also manage their contradictions
 yadi itihaas par gaur karen to yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki kahana jitna aasaan he, utana karnaa nahin

 Seeing this act of Nisha Priya Bhatia, the judge ordered a mental condition to be investigated in a hurry
 nyaayamurti ajit bharihok ne bhaatia kii maansik jaanch karaane kaa aadesh dete hue kaha ‘khuli adaalat main khud ko nirvastr karne kaa yachikakarta (nisha priya bhaatia) kaa bartaav bahut khedjanak he or isse aisa lagata he ki vah maansik rup se thik nahin hai

 mahila adhikari kaa aarope he ki ro ke purv pramukh chaturvedi unhen bevakt apane karyaalay main bulaayaa karte the or ashisht tippaniyan karte the
 However, Chaturvedi has denied the allegations

 Even taking care of the worship of Shivling is prohibited for them
 aisi manyata he ki lingam ek saath yoni (jo devi shakti kaa pratik he evam mahila kii rachanaatmak urja he) kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 According to Vinod Mishra, therefore, a woman is not allowed to move close to the Shivling
 aisa isliye kyonki bhagwaan shiv behad gambhir tapasya main leen rahete hai
 If the sleep of Mahadev, the God of the Gods, is not disturbed, the women have been told not to worship Shivalinga
 jab shiv kii tandra bhang hoti he to ve krodhit ho jate hai
 Apart from this, Maa Parvati also does not like doing pooja by touching the women celebrating

 Women should worship Shiva in idol form

 Justice Gogoi retiring on November 17: The last working day of CJI Gogoi, the Supreme Court is going to pronounce its verdict in the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid case of Ayodhya, probably the most talked about and controversial issue of Ayodhya on 15 November
 is maamle kii sunwaayee puri karne ke baad desh kii sheersh adaalat ne apana faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 Since then it was speculated that a decision in this case would come before the Chief Justice of Justice Ranjan Gogoi retires
 nyaayamurti gogoi 17 november ko ritair ho rahe hai
 Although the court can sit on any day, hear the case and give its verdict, but still it is Sunday on 17 November and in such a large number of cases, the decision does not come on a holiday
 saath hi jis din nyaayadhish sevanivrutt ho rahe hon, us din bhi bade maamalon main faisle aamtaur se nahin sunaae jate
 Earlier, on 16 November, Saturday is also a holiday
 aise main nyaayamurti ranjan gogoi kaa antim kaarydiwas 15 november ko pad rahaa he
 This led to speculation that the verdict of the Ayodhya case could be heard by a bench headed by Justice Gogoi on 14 or 15 November
 lekin, isamen bhi ek pench saamne aayaa
 Normally, if a court announces a verdict, then the next day, the plaintiff or one of the defendants pleads to the court to take this decision once again by taking refuge in the court
 isamen bhi ek yaa do din lag jate hai
 In the case of the verdict in this case on November 14-15, it would have slipped one or two days again to November 16-17
 iske baavjood, na hi adaalat or na hi sarkaar se, kisi bhi taraf se yah sanket nahin mila ki ayodhya maamle main faisla 14-15 november se pehle bhi aa saktaa he
 Then suddenly, on Friday night, information comes that the verdict on the Ayodhya case will be pronounced on Saturday morning at half past ten
 mana ja rahaa he ki yah achaanak elaan is suvichaarit ranneeti kaa hissaa he ki is behad samvedansheel, bhaawanaaon or aasthaaon se jude maamle main asaamaajik tatwon ko kisi tarah kii khuraafaat ke liye taiyaari kaa mauka nahin mil sake
 And that's why it was announced on Friday night that after a night's cut, it would be decided on Saturday morning, as well as a verdict in the case
 desh or ayodhya ke pradesh uttar pradesh main shanti ke liye isse pehle isi ranneeti ke tahat puri taiyaari kar lee gai

 Now he has published what he has woven around the intimate episodes of his life, calling him the autobiography of a stubborn girl named Aphudari
 bakaul lekhika ke, aapahudari kaa samay bahut lanbaa he or bhugol vishaal
 He is now in his 86th year of his age and in this book he recounts his intimate moments from the 1970s
 us samay unki umr mahaj 40 saal kii thaharti he
 In this way, the details of the long part of his age are yet to be published, which are expected to be more interesting

 Whereas despite the boldness in the accident, a political discussion also goes along with it, while Ramanika Gupta in Apahudari explores different dimensions in the discussion of intimacy and prepares the woman to become a self-proclaimed self

 Ramanika has served Hindi as a social worker, but eventually the whole book is her own personal journey, in which the society is left behind but it is readable, but in addition, a fearless woman has very bold views of the intimacy of her life

 deshbhar main 2019 ke aam chunaav kaa maahaul ban rahaa he
 If the Modi government is giving proof of development to the public by putting its welfare schemes in front, then the Congress has now opened a front against the government on the Rafale deal
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne is raksha saude main na sirf ghotaale kaa daawa kiya he, balki sidhe taur par is deal main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii bhoomika par sawaal uthaae hai
 The Congress President has said, 'modiji personally got this deal done
 modiji vyaktigat rup se paris gaye
 The deal was changed in person
 puraa bharat ise jaanata he
 Not only this, Rahul also questioned the statement of Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman
 unhone kaha, 'raksha mantri kah rahi hai ki vah is saude ke bare main bharat, shaheedon or unke parijanon ko vimaanon ke upar vyay kiye gaye dhan ke bare main jaankaree nahin dengi
 What does this mean? This means that the scam took place
 'darasal, raksha mantri ne is sambandh main rajyasabha main likhit jawaab diya he ki france se rafel fiter plane ke saude kii jaankaree saarvajanik nahin kii ja sakati, kyonki deal ko lekar hui baatcheet rajkeey gopneeyata he
 This defense minister's statement has given the Congress a big weapon to dominate and the BJP seems to be staring at these arguments of the main opposition party
 
 -why is not sharing the details of the deal? -why was the fighter plane bought at such a high price? -why is the technology not being transferred in this deal? Why is Congress accusing scam Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad That the Prime Minister, during his visit to France, made the purchase by ignoring the fixed prices
 unhone daawa kiya kii modi ke shashan kaal main ek rafel vimaan 1570
 Purchased for Rs
 8 crores, while 526 at the cost of this one aircraft during UPA
 1 karod rupaye main sahmati bani thi
 Why is India expensive? Azad also claimed that the fighter plane that the Modi government has signed for India, the same plane to Qatar 694
 8 karod rupaye main bechaa gaya he
 So why was India sold at a 100 per cent higher price? ”what is the complete deal? In fact, the Congress-led UPA government started the process of buying Rafale fighter plane in 2010
 lekin uske kaarykaal main deal final nahin ho pai
 In 2014, the power at the center changed and the BJP government was formed under the leadership of Narendra Modi
 23 sitambar, 2016 ko france ke rakshaamantri jyaan eve driyaan or bharat ke rakshaamantri manohar parrikar ne dilli main rafel deal par sin kiye
 Under this deal, India has to get 36 Rafale fighter aircraft from France
 haalanki, ye puraa sauda 126 vimaanon kaa tha
 According to an earlier statement by former Defense Minister AK Antony, in the deal it was decided that 18 ships would be bought 'off the shelf' and 108 ships would be built in India
 ab congress ye aarope laga rahi he ki modi sarkaar ne 36 vimaan kharidne kaa nirnay ekatarfa dhang se kiya
 The Congress has also alleged that the rules in aircraft purchase were ignored, even prior permission was not taken from the Cabinet Committee on Security
 iske alaava media reports main ye bhi daawa kiya gaya he ki ladaaku vimaanon kharidne ke liye jo tender niklaa tha, usamen 6 companiyon ke vimaan the
 But the Indian Air Force decided to buy the flight plane from him, describing Rafale as the best
 ab bijepi ke liye mushkil ye he ki congress ne daawa kiya ki modi ji vyaktigat rup se paris gaye or unhone vahaan jaakar vyaktigat rup se saude ko badalawaaya
 Secondly, instead of 18, 36 aircraft are being purchased and no information is being given by the government about this whole deal
 teesraa ye ki congress kah rahi he ki ab ek plane kii keemat 1555 karod rupee he jabaki congress 428 karod main rupee main ye vimaan kharid rahi thi
 On the basis of this plea, the Congress is alleging scam in the purchase of aircraft
 bijepi kii upi yuva ikai ne gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi or bhartiya janata yuva morcha ke rashtriya adhyaksh anuraag thakur se milaane ke naam par yuvaaon ke saath jo kuch kiya he, use dhokhadhadi na kaha jaae, to or kya kaha jaae
 The first phase of the membership campaign being run by the party's Yuva Morcha exposed a number of flaws, proving that the Yuva Morcha is betraying the youth of the state in extreme enthusiasm
 bhartiya janata yuva morcha (bhajayumo) kii ore se 23 july ko puure desh main sadsyta abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii gai
 The spirited Yuva Morcha raised the target to create 10 lakh members given by the central leadership to 20 lakh
 isi din rajdhani sahit pradesh ke kareeb 55 jilon main sadsyta abhiyaan kii shuruyaat bhi hui or shaam hote-hote daawa kiya gaya ki pehle hi din 50 hajaar sadasyon ne bijepi kii sadsyta grahan kar lee
 On behalf of the BJYMO it was said that about 50 thousand people were made members of the BJP on the first day
 iske ulat, lakhanu main yojit sadsyta kaarykram main saikadon logon se farm to bharwaaye gaye lekin party kii adhikrut raseed (sadsyta bahi) kuch hi logon ke haath lagi
 On this question, the party officials said that the membership fee was taken only from those who have been given the book, then the question is whether the people from whom the forms have been filled, will again come to collect BJP by depositing five rupees
 Or will the excited youth activists of the BJYM go to the house of those youths themselves and grab them the bjp's authorized book
 doosraa sabase bada sawaal yah he ki jin yuvaaon ne farm bhar die hai, unhen bijepi kii sadsyta kii raseed nahin mili he
 In such a situation, how can he be considered a member of the BJP? That is, thousands of forms were distributed without giving a book and the number of those people was also beaten by adding that more than 50 thousand members were made on the first day
 sawaal yah he ki itane bade kaarykram ko shuru karne se pehle yuva morche kii ore se adhikrut bahi kyon nahin chhapavai gai
 That is, in the name of meeting Modi and BJYM national president Anurag Thakur, the youth were cheated by just filling up the form
 kaabilegaur he ki bhajayumo kii taraf se yah bhi ghoshnaa kii gai he ki jo yuva ek hajaar sadsy banayega use modi se milane kaa mauka diya jayega or jo yuva 500 sadsy banayega use anuraag thakur se milaayaa jayega
 When the youth was not given the party's authorized book during the membership drive, how can it be decided who made 1000 and who made 500 members
 sadsyta abhiyaan ke bare main uttar pradesh bijepi yuva morche ke adhyaksh ashutosh raay ne kaha ki sadsyta abhiyaan ke pehle din 50 hajaar logon ko joda gaya
 Still people are excited to join BJP
 raay se jab yah poocha gaya ki sadsyta abhiyaan ke dauraan yuvaaon ko party kii adhikrut raseed kyon nahi di ja rahi he to unhone kaha, 'party ko ummid nahin thi ki itane log judenge
 Later, the books fell short, so only the youth were filled with forms
 unhen baad main bahi di jaaegi
 Rai, however, also said that the bjp's best efforts will be to reach out to all the youth
 party ke pradesh adhyaksh lakshmikant vaajapeyi ne kaha ki kendriya netritv ke nirdesh par is kaarykram kii shuruyaat bhajayumo ne kii he
 As far as the matter of giving authorized receipts during the membership drive is concerned, the campaign was started with the help of authorized books
 jald hi or bahiyaan chhapavai jaaengi

 The news of the jamaat-ud-dawa chief and Lashkar leader Hafiz Saeed being detained for six months is making headlines on Tuesday
 hafiz ko hiraasat main liye jane ke baad soshal media par ek video viral ho rahaa he jisamen hafiz ko yah kehete hue dekha ja rahaa he ki bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi or america raashtrapati donald trump ke bich dosti kii vajah se use house arest kiya gaya he
 There is also speculation that the action was taken by Pakistan after the warning in which the US said that if action is not taken against Jamaat-ud Dawa, then it can ban Pakistan
 inke sabake bich yah jaan lenaa bhi jaruri he ki hafiz said ko nazarband karne kii ghatana pehali baar nahin hui he
 Even before this, Hafiz Saeed has been arrested from time to time
 13 disambar 2001 ko bhartiya sansad par hamale main santh ganth ke aarope main said ko pakistan sarkaar ne hiraasat main liya tha or march 2002 main reeha karne ke baad ek baar phir 31 oktober 2002 ko lashkar sargana ko house arest kar liya gaya tha
 The comments isi tarah 2006 main mumbai train hamale ke baad pakistan ke punjab praant ne hafiz ko nazarband kar liya tha lekin kuch hi din baad lahore hoicourt ke aadesh par reeha kar diya gaya
 After this, Saeed was once again detained in a guest house on the same matter but later released in a court order
 iske baad disambar 2008 main ek baar phir hafiz said ko tab nazarband kar liya gaya jab sanyukt raashtra ne said kii tathakthith dharmik sanstha jamaat ud daawa ko aatankwaadi sanghathanon kii suchi main shaamil kiya
 Explain that the Jamaat Ud Dawa claims to be a philanthropic organization but has also been described as a cooperative organization of the banned lashkar-e-taiba
 iske baad bharat kii said ke pratyrpan kii maang ke baad 2009 main baar baar hafiz ko house arest karke, court ke aadesh par reeha kiya gaya
 While the impact of Trump's detention of Hafiz for many, there are some people who do not take this step of taking repeated steps against Saeed of Pakistan Government seriously now
 jaisaa ki ek twitor yuzar ne likhaa he ki hafiz said ko house arest karne kaa matlab he ab chikan biryani unke ghar tak pahunchaai jaaegi
 Hafiz Saeed house arrest simply means that chicken biryani will be home delivered to him
 — shalya chikitsa (@velabhai1) January 31, 2017 At the same time, there is hope in Twitter user Gabbar Singh's tweet, when reacting to the news of Hafiz's house arrest, 'america had put a reward of $ 10 million on Hafiz Saeed in 2012
 obama ke puure shasankaal main haafiz khulla ghumaa
 Hafiz is under house arrest within a week of Trump's arrival
 ' It is also important to know among them that the incident of detention of Hafiz Saeed is not the first time
 isse pehle bhi samay samay par hafiz said ko house arest kiya ja chukaa he
 On 13 December 2001, Saeed was detained by the Pakistan government on charges of collusion in an attack on the Indian Parliament, and once again released on March 31, 2002, the let leader was arrested on 31 October 2002
 tippaniyan Similarly, Hafiz was detained by the Punjab province of Pakistan after the 2006 Mumbai train attack but was released a few days later on the orders of the Lahore High Court
 iske baad ek baar phir isi maamle par said ko hiraasat main lekar ek guest house main band rakhaa gaya lekin baad main adaalat ke aadesh main chhod diya gaya
 Then in December 2008, Hafiz Saeed was placed under house arrest once again when the United Nations included Saeed's so-called religious organization Jamaat Ud Dawa in the list of terrorist organizations
 bataa den ki jamaat ud daawa khud ko paropkaaree sanghathan bataati he lekin use pratibandhit lashkar e taiyaba kaa sahoyagi sanghathan bhi bataaya jaataa rahaa he
 After this, Hafiz was repeatedly released on a court order by house arrest in 2009 after India's demand for Saeed's extradition
 jahaan kaiyon ke liye hafiz ko nazarband kiya janaa trump kaa asar he, vahiin kuch log aise bhi hai jo pakistan sarkaar ke said ke khilaaf baar baar uthaae jane vaale is kadam ko ab gambhirtha se nahin lete

 ' isi tarah 2006 main mumbai train hamale ke baad pakistan ke punjab praant ne hafiz ko nazarband kar liya tha lekin kuch hi din baad lahore hoicourt ke aadesh par reeha kar diya gaya
 After this, Saeed was once again detained in a guest house on the same matter but later released in a court order
 iske baad disambar 2008 main ek baar phir hafiz said ko tab nazarband kar liya gaya jab sanyukt raashtra ne said kii tathakthith dharmik sanstha jamaat ud daawa ko aatankwaadi sanghathanon kii suchi main shaamil kiya

 iske baad bharat kii said ke pratyrpan kii maang ke baad 2009 main baar baar hafiz ko house arest karke, court ke aadesh par reeha kiya gaya

 This was promoted through Twitter
 isi kram main ek twit main dhoni kaa form bhi post kar diya gaya, jis par aapatti jataate hue sakshi ne ravishankar prasad se sawaal-jawaab kiye
 Witness said that there is something called privacy or not? The details of the Aadhaar card including the application have been made public
 is par mantri ravishankar ne kaha ki nahin, yah koi saarvajanik sampatti nahin he
 Does this tweet reveal any personal information? To which the witness said that the personal information filled in the form has been leaked

 unhone kaha ki aadhaar card adhinium main yah bahut spasht rup se likhaa hua he ki yadi kisi yogya vyakti ke paas aadhaar card nahin he to bhi use laabhon se vanchit nahin kiya jayega

 On Wednesday evening, the victim went to the MIDC police station in Andheri East and recorded her statement
 arunabh ne peedita ke aarope ko jhootha bataate hue kanoonee ladaai ladane kii baat kahi he
 However, many girls have sensationally accused Arunabh
 ek ladki ne likhaa he
 
 
 'I had a meeting with three women at Arunabh's house
 apartment ke haul main meeting chal rahi thi
 Then Arunabh got up leaving the meeting in the middle and went inside
 kuch der bitne ke baad jab vah nahin aayaa, to main aawaaj dete hue andar kii taraf gai
 Suddenly, i realized that someone came back and pressed both of my chests
 main peeche mudakar dekhi, to wo arunabh tha
 i was surprised vah meri ankhon main ankhen daalkar dekh rahaa tha
 i ran from the room
 meeting turant khatm karke laut ai
 TVF never returned after this
 'ji haa, ye us mahila kii sansanikhej daastaan he, jisane utyub channel ‘da viral fever’ (TVF) ke siio or sansthaapak arunabh kumaar par chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The victim alleged that she was molested several times during her two and a half year tenure

 ‘have you heard the name of Chaturbhuj place?’ About 6 pm that day

 He said that some part of my work has not been completed
 main turant offis pahunchi
 Three people were present there
 unamem se do paanch minute ke andar chale gaye

 usne meri taraf dekha or poocha- chatrbhuj sthaan kaa naam suni ho? main chakit thi
 Chaturbhuj is the red light area of muzaffarpur in Bihar
 maine is sawaal par koi respance nahin diya
 He further asked - i like Chaturbhuj place
 udhar commercial deal hoti hai
 'there is less time, let's hurry a bit' You too have come on a commercial deal
 is baat ko taalte hue maine kaha- arunabh aap bade bhai hai
 i am not feeling well kya karnaa he bataaie
 We will go home
 tabhi usne achaanak meraa haath pakadaa or kaha madam thodaa role play karen
 i was surprised tab se yah rojaanaa hone laga
 i was repeatedly molested
 ek din ola kii team se hamaari meeting ho rahi thi
 Suddenly Arunabh got up from the meeting and went inside
 usne mujhe aawaaj di
 When i went inside, she said- there is less time, do it in a little hurry main awak use dekhati rahi
 Arunabh said- Police is in my pocket, after this i told him that i will go to the police
 is par usne kaha- police to meri jeb main he
 i also spoke to several senior officers on this, but no one helped me
 peedita ne apane blog main likhaa he ki uski or arunabh kumaar kii mulaakaat mumbai ke ek cafe main saal 2014 main hui thi
 Arunabh gave him a job in his company
 peedita or arunabh bihar ke ek hi shahar se hai
 He felt that he would get help from Arunabh, but all this happened to him within 21 days of the job
 iaiti classmet ko bhi nahin bakshkarunabh kumaar par keval uske saath kaam karne vaali mahilaon ne hi chhedchhad kaa aarope nahin lagayaa he, balki iaiti khadgpur main uske saath padhane vaali ek ladki ne bhi us par sansanikhej aarope lagaae hai
 He told the Hindi website The Quint - This incident happened to me in 2012 in Mumbai
 ham donon coffee pine ke liye ek saath gaye the
 At that time, Arunabh said to me - 'will you come to my house and dance with me
 ' main hairaan thi
 He asked me to dance naked in front of him
 padosi ne bhi lagaaya chhedchhad kaa aropaklasamet ke alaava arunabh kumaar kii ek padosi ne bhi likhaa he- ek din main uske studio ke baahar phone par baat kar rahi thi
 He gave me a voice and called inside
 main smil diya or tahalne lagi
 After this he told me that i had gone to Ratnagiri
 vahaan se aam lekar aayaa he
 He asked me if i would eat this? During this time he was trying to caress my whole body
 main dar gai
 Say no to him and give a punch and escaped from there
 vah uskaa iraadaa bhaap chuki thi ki vah mujhase kya chahta tha
 TVF member told the baseless allegations of tampering on Arunabh Kumar, tvf's core team member Nidhi Bisht wrote on Facebook - 'TVF is one of the best places for women to work
 mere saath team TVF or khasakarunabhabehad sammaan ke saath pesh aate hai
 Of course this does not mean that everyone's experience is like that
 24 ghante pehle jab pehla blog aayaa, to maine ise puri tarah se khaarij kar diya
 i checked, but no records were found at the victim office
 uske aarope puri tarah niraadhaar or bebuniyaad hai

 jpg aam chunaav 2014 main dilli kii saaton seat jeetne vaali bijepi ke liye maujuuda dilli vidhansabha main sarkaar bananaa behad kathin ho gaya he
 Three mlas, including his chief ministerial candidate Harsh Vardhan, have become mps by winning the Lok Sabha elections
 aise main 70 sadasyon vaali vidhansabha main bijepi kaa ganit 32 se ghatakar 29 rah gaya he
 In such a situation, social worker and former IPS officer Kiran Bedi may be the face of BJP in Delhi
 teen siten khaali hone ke baad sarkaar banane ke liye upachunaav se pehle bhi kam se kam 34 vidhayakon kii jarurat padegi
 That means BJP will have to raise five mlas
 jabaki maujuuda vidhansabha main aam aadmi party ke 28 or congress ke 8 vidhayak hai
 In such a situation, even if the BJP gets the support of the other two mlas, the party is unable to juggle the majority figure
 aise main bijepi kii ummid aam aadmi party main sambhavit tut par he
 If this does not happen, the BJP will insist on holding the Assembly elections afresh, as it seems to get easy majority in the latest Modi wave
 lekin aisi paristhiti main mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar koun hoga, yah tay karnaa bijepi ke liye aasaan nahin he
 If Harshvardhan is brought back, BJP will have to find a new face for the by-election from Chandni Chowk Lok Sabha seat, which has the potential to defeat Congress and AAP
 agar harshavardhan ko centre kii sarkaar main jimmedaari di jaati he, to sutron ke mutabik kiran bedi ko phir se bijepi se jodne kii kavayad ho sakati he
 Bedi himself has given a statement to be ready to think rather than reject any such proposal in view of the election results and the Modi wave

 In this connection, Praja Rajyam Party chief and film star Chiranjeevi is scheduled to meet Pranab Mukherjee on Monday

 is bich telugana raashtra samiti ke adhyaksh chandrashekhar raav ne ummid jataai he ki faisalaa telugana rajya ke paksh main hoga
 He also warned that if the Center tried to suppress the issue, he would again go on a hunger strike

 On September 24, when she had gone to work inside an inner settlement in Okhla area, the gang-miscreants took out her bag, making false gestures of breaking the car puncture and glass

 Meanwhile, two gang miscreants of the taunted gang made a false gesture of the woman breaking the car and breaking the glass

 According to the police, the accused were following the woman from around 2 km away

 The BJP, moving away from its tradition of not announcing the name of a leader in the state elections, declared Union Minister Sarbananda Sonowal as its Chief Ministerial candidate for the Assam Assembly elections

 When Nadda was asked if the party would announce the name of the chief ministerial candidate in other contested states, he said that the issue was not considered and a decision would be taken later
 53 varshiya sonoval philhal khel or yuva maamalon ke kendriya mantri (swatantra prabhaar) hai
 Sonowal was the president of the All Assam Students Union and leader of the AGP before joining the BJP in 2011

 Of the five states where elections are due in the next few months, the BJP has the highest expectations from Assam where it emerged as the single largest party during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections

 The Prime Minister hoped that he would bring more success to the party in future
