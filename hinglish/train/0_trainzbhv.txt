 kanoon banakarram mandirnirmaan kaa rasta saaf karne kii maang jor pakad rahi he
 The Modi government has not taken any decision on this
 lekincongresskah rahi he ki sarkaar ko supreme court ke faisle kaa intjaar karnaa chahie
 However, 25 years ago, the Congress government was under the ordinance on Ayodhyamasale, which came to be known as the Ayodhya Act
 tab bhaajapa ne iskaa virodh kiya tha
 The Babri Masjid was demolished on 6 December 1992 as a result of the Ram Temple movement led by the BJP, led by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad
 iske ek saal baad janvari 1993 main yah adhyadesh laayaa gaya
 It was approved by the then President Shankar Dayal Sharma on 7 January 1993
 iske tahat vivaadit parisar kii kuch jameen kaa sarkaar kii taraf se adhigrahan kiya janaa tha
 After the approval from the President, the then Home Minister SB Chavan put this bill in the Lok Sabha for approval
 paas hone ke baad ise ayodhya adhinium ke naam se janaa gaya
 What was said while presenting the Home Minister Nabil, the then Home Minister Chavan had said, “it is necessary to maintain the spirit of communal harmony and brotherhood among the people of the country
 " thik yahi tark bijepi or aresas ke netaa bhi de rahe hai
 The Ayodhya Act was brought to acquire the disputed structure and the land adjacent to it
 narsimha raav sarkaar ne 2
 77 acres of disputed land with 60 all around it
 70 acre bhoomi adhigrahit kii thi
 The Congress government's plan was to build a Ram temple, a mosque, library, museum and other facilities in Ayodhya
 bijepi ne ayodhya adhinium kaa kiya tha virodhhalanki ayodhya adhinium se ram mandir nirmaan kaa rasta saaf nahin ho paaya
 The BJP strongly opposed the move of the Narasimha Rao government
 bijepi ke tatkaaleen upaadhyaksh eses bhandari ne is kanoon ko pakshpatpurna, tuchh or pratikul bataate hue khaarij kar diya tha
 Muslim organizations along with BJP also opposed this law
 supreme court se raay bhi maangi thi congress sarkaar nenrasimha raav sarkaar ne anuchhed 143 ke tahat supreme court se bhi is masale par salaah maangi thi lekin supreme court ne raay dene se manaa kar diya tha
 The government had asked the Supreme Court whether there was a Hindu temple or any Hindu structure at the disputed site of Ram Janbhumi Babri Masjid
 5 jajon (justise emen venkatchalaiya, jees verma, jien re, eem ahmadi or espi bharuchaa) kii khandpeeth ne in sawaalon par vichaar kiya tha lekin koi jawaab nahin diya tha
 What the Supreme Court said was that the Supreme Court had interpreted the Ayodhya Act 1994
 supreme court ne bahumat ke aadhaar par vivaadit jagah ke jameen sambandhi malikana haq (tital suut) se sambadhit kanoon par ste laga diya tha
 The court said that it cannot be implemented until it is settled in a court
 supreme court ne adhigrahit jameen par ek ram mandir, ek masjid ek librari or duusari suvidhaon kaa intjaam karne kii baat kaa samarthan kiya tha lekin yah bhi kaha tha ki yah raashtrapati ke liye badhyakaari nahin he
 In this way the Ayodhya Act became meaningless
 elahabadaaai courtne tay kiya tha jameen kaa malikana haq16 saal baad elahabaad hai court ne jameen ke malikana haq ke bare main faisla diya
 Court 2
 77 acre jameen ko 3 hisson main baanta
 Ram Lala (seated), Nirmohi Arena and Sunni Waqf Board
 elahabaad hai court ke nirnay ke khilaaf supreme court main kai yachikaayen daayar kar di gayi
 The same was to be heard continuously from October 29
 sunwaayee ab agle salsupreme court ne elahabaad hai court ke faisle ki khilaaf hone vaali sunwaayee ko 2019 tak taalkar yah sandesh de diya he ki use koi jaldi nahin he
 a bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi has made it clear that a new bench will decide what is the date of hearing
 kanoon banane kii maang, vipakshi kar rahe virotharees kaa kahana he ki agar supreme court jald faisla nahin de saktaa to modi sarkaar ko kanoon banaakar ram mandir ke nirmaan main aa rahi rukaawaton ko dur karnaa chahie
 The Vishwa Hindu Parishad clearly says that Hindus do not have enough patience to wait for the Supreme Court's decision
 bijepi netaa subramanyam swami or centre main mantri giriraaj singh ne maang kii he ki ram mandir nirmaan ke liye jald se jald adhyadesh laayaa jaae
 At the same time, the Congress and Communist parties say that the government should wait for the decision of the Supreme Court
 is bich kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha he ki log chaahate hai ki jameen ke malikana haq (tital suut) se judi yachika kaa jald se jald nipataara ho
 He also said that the central government has full faith in the Supreme Court

 After the Uri attack, Pakistan seems to be preparing for war amid growing tension on the outskirts
 lekin pakistan ko patkhni dene ke liye bharat ko kisi jang kii jarurat hi nahin, hindustan kootneeti ke morche par hi pakistan ko chaaron khaane chit kar saktaa he
 a review of the Indus River Water Agreement is a sign of this
 bharat pakistan ke saath 56 saal puraane sindhu nadi samjhaute kii samiksha kar rahaa he
 The Ministry of Water Resources has held several rounds of meetings in this regard
 kya he sindhu nadi samjhautasindhu nadi samjhauta bharat or pakistan ke bichpani ke bantwareko lekar hui sandhi he
 On 19 September 1960, the agreement was signed between the then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and President of Pakistan Ayub Khan
 is samjhaute ke mutabik purab kii teen nadiyon beas, raavi or satluj kaa niyantran bharat ko diya gaya jabaki pashchim kii teen nadiyonsindhu, chenab or jhelum kaa niyantran pakistan ko diya gaya
 The World Bank was a mediator in this agreement
 bharat ke liye kai paabandiyanis samjhaute ke tahat pani ke bantwaare ko lekar jo praavdhaan banaae gaye the, wo behad vivaadit hai
 Since these rivers of Pakistan first flow into India, India is allowed to produce irrigation, transport and electricity, while India is forbidden to build dams or other projects along the banks of the river
 pakistan ko is baat kaa dar tha ki jang ke vakt agar bharat ne pani chhodana band kar diya to uske mulk main sookhe or akaal kii sthiti aa jaaegi
 Because the Indus Basin rivers have their source in India
 haalanki, abhi tak aisi naubat nahin ai he
 In 2003, the Jammu and Kashmir government demanded the cancellation of the Indus River Agreement
 pakistan ko 80 fisadi pani1960 main kii gai sindhu nadi sandhi ko aadhunik vishwa ke itihaas kaa sabase udaar jal bantwaaraa mana jaataa he
 Pakistan 80 under this
 52 fisadi pani yani 167
 2 billion cubic meters of water is given annually
 nadi kii upree dhara ke bantwaare main udaartaa kii aisi misaal duniya main or kisi jal samjhaute main nahin milti
 Is it difficult for Pakistan to stop water? Here the question also arises whether it is easy to reject the Indus Water Agreement
 kya pakistan kii taraf jane vaale pani ko band karnaa aasaan he
 Because there is every possibility that after this Pakistan will cry on the international stage
 lekinkisi bhi desh ke sansaadhan par duusare desh kaa adhikaar tabhi he, jab us desh kaa vyavhaar dostana ho
 No international agreement can compel a nation to give water to terrorists
 nadiyon ke pani par niyantran ke siddhant ke mutabik pakistan jane vaali nadiyon ke pani par bharat kaa haq he
 India can give water to Pakistan in the same circumstances when it behaves like a well-wisher country
 antarrashtriya sandhi par faislon kii baat karen to abhi china ne bhi dakshin china sagar main apane khilaaf faisle ko nahin mana
 However, one practical problem of stopping the water is that even if the water is stopped, we have to be ready to avoid floods in the cities of Srinagar, Jammu and Punjab
 lekin jaankaar ye bhi kehete hai ki agar bharat sindhu, jhelum or chenab par thodi thodi duuri par baandh bana den or kuch pani sinchai ke liye istemaal kare to pakistan ghutane tech degaa
 
 
 
 to registan ban jayega pakistansindhu nadi pakistan kii life line maani jaati he
 Indus water irrigates 90 percent of Pakistan's cultivable land and 65 percent of Pakistan's fertile and residential land is around the Indus
 jabaki bharat 36 lakh acre jameen par sindhu kaa pani jamaa kar saktaa he jo ki bharat ne abtak nahin kiya he
 According to experts, if India stops the water, a large part of Pakistan can become a desert
 sirf sindhu nadi jal samjhauta hi nahin, kootneeti ke har morche par bharat ne pakistan ko pani pilaane kii ranneeti par amal shuru kar diya he
 Before the war, there are many arrows in the quiver of India, Pakistan will be shattered

 yahi vajah he ki himalay main bada bukamp aana koi nai baat nahin he
 After studying the major earthquakes that have occurred in previous years, geologists agree on the conclusion that a major earthquake can occur in the Himalayas at any time
 'jaankaron kii maane to bade bukamp yani 8 yaa isse zyada kii tivrata kaa bukamp jin ilaakon main aane kii sambhaavna he wo ilaake hai, kashmir, himachal pradesh, uttarakhand, nepal, bihar kaa tarai vaala ilaaka or assam
 Recently, scientists from Stanford University of America, in a study with the Indian Institute of NGRI, have found that the main Himalayan thrust in the Himalayas, MHT is very active
 yahaan par aise sanket mil rahe hai ki riector scale par 8 yaa isse zyada kii tivrata kaa bukamp kabhi bhi tabaahi machaa saktaa he
 According to scientists, MHT is the area where Eurasian and Indian plates are colliding
 is vajah se urasian plate upar uth rahi he
 In many areas, due to this, many parts of the Himalayas are rising at a speed of 34 millimeters every year
 chintaa kii baat ye he ki himalay main kai ilaake aise hai jahaan par chattaanon main tanaav ekatra ho rahaa he
 In such areas, there is a lot of breakage in the rocks, but in areas where major earthquakes have not occurred for a long time, there is a high risk of tremendous earthquakes
 dilli uniwarsity ke bhuvigyaan ke echodi professor si es dube kii sismik gap theory ke mutabik jin ilaakon main pichley 100 saal se bade bukamp nahin aae hai un ilaakon main bade bukamp kii sambhaavna lagaataar bani hui he
 The area of kedarnath is also one of these areas
 haal hi main ativrishti kii vajah se kedarnath dham main hui tabaahi dekhne ke baad ye sochakar man kaanp uthta he ki agar bada bukamp is ilaake main aayaa to baari tabaahi se ise koi nahin bachaa saktaa he

 Mulayam Singh Yadav, among other representatives of the Janata Parivar including Lalu Yadav, on Monday declared Nitish Kumar as the Chief Ministerial candidate of Bihar in Delhi
 iske saath hi bihar main janata parivaar ke bich aapasi kalah kii atakalein bhi khatm ho gai
 Indeed, accepting Lalu as the chief ministerial contender was a difficult decision for Lalu Yadav
 lalu yadav ne mulaayam kii maujudi main kaha ki bihar main sampradayik takaton ko haraana unki praathamikta he or iske liye vah kisi bhi tarah kaa zehar pine ke liye taiyaar hai
 He said, 'I assure the secular forces and the people of India that i am ready to drink all kinds of sips in the battle of Bihar
 ham har tarah kaa ghunt pine ko taiyaar hai
 We are ready to drink every kind of poison
 ' Pointing towards BJP, Lalu said, 'I am committed to crush this snake's fun, this cobra of communalism
 ' However, many issues remain in this alliance in the name of defeating communal forces
 siton ke bantwaare kaa sawaal bhi bachaa hua he
 When asked about this, Lalu Yadav said that when the hearts have been met, the distribution of tickets will not be difficult
 tippaniyan However, now the real question is in Patna where there is still talk of seat sharing
 somvaar ko patna main nitish kumaar ne kaha ki donon partiyon kii taraf se teen-teen netaa mangalvaar ko baithkar siton ke bantwaare par charchaa karenge
 Before this announcement in Delhi, Nitish Kumar had made it clear in Patna that an alliance was going to happen
 ab is gathbandhan ke tisare saajhedaar ke taur par congress par sabaki nazar he
 JDU has said that she will also be together
 darasal ye andaaza sabko tha ki bihar main lalu-nitish saath naa aa sake to bijepi phaayde main rahegi
 Now this alliance has sounded a danger bell for BJP in Bihar
 lalu yadav sahit janata parivaar ke duusare numaayidon ke bich mulaayam singh yadav ne somvaar ko dilli main nitish kumaar ko bihar ke mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya
 With this, the speculation of infighting among the Janata family in Bihar has also ended
 darasal nitish kumaar ko mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar ke taur par sweekaar karnaa lalu yadav ke liye ek mushkil faisla tha
 Lalu Yadav said in the presence of Mulayam that defeating communal forces in Bihar is his priority and for this he is ready to drink any kind of poison
 unhone kaha, 'main dharmanirpeksh takaton or bharat kii janata ko bharosa dilaataa hum ki bihar kii ladaai main main har tarah kaa ghunt pine ko taiyaar hum
 We are ready to drink every kind of sip
 ham har tarah kaa jehar pine ke liye taiyaar hai
 ' vahiin bijepi kii ore ishaara karte hue lalu ne kaha, 'main is saanp kaa fan, sampradayikta ke is cobra ko kuchalane ke liye patibaddh hum
 ' haalanki sampradayik takaton ko haraane ke naam par hue is gathbandhan main kai masalon par baat baaki he
 There is also a question of seat sharing
 lalu yadav se jab is bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki jab dil mil gaye hai to tikaton ke bantwaare main mushkil nahin aegi
 The comments haalanki ab asli sawaal patna main he jahaan siton ke bantwaare par baat honi abhi baaki he
 In Patna on Monday, Nitish Kumar said that on behalf of both parties, three leaders will sit on Tuesday to discuss seat sharing
 dilli main hue is elaan se pehle patna main nitish kumaar ne saaf kar diya tha ki gathbandhan hone ja rahaa he
 Now, as the third partner of this alliance, all eyes are on the Congress
 jediu kah chuki he ki wo bhi saath hogi
 In fact, it was known to everyone that if lalu-nitish could not come together in Bihar, BJP would be benefited
 ab is gathbandhan ne bihar main bijepi ke liye khatare kii ghanti baja di he
 Indeed, accepting Lalu as the chief ministerial contender was a difficult decision for Lalu Yadav
 lalu yadav ne mulaayam kii maujudi main kaha ki bihar main sampradayik takaton ko haraana unki praathamikta he or iske liye vah kisi bhi tarah kaa zehar pine ke liye taiyaar hai

 jharkhand ke ramgarh main guuruuvaar ko kathith gorakshakon ne gomance le jane ke shaq main ek vine driver kii peet-peet kar hatya kar di
 Some people were moving from Chittarpur to New Sarai with large quantities of meat from a Maruti van
 is bich ramgarh bazaar taand ke paas bajrang dal or goraksha samiti ke logon ne is gaadi ko roak kar maance ko sadak par phenk diya
 Police has registered a case against 12 people
 kathith gorakshakon ne gaadi ko aag ke hawaale kar diya, vahiin driver mohammad asagar ko buree tarah se peeta, jisneranchi ke ahospataal main dam tod diya
 In the middle of the city of Ramgarh in Jharkhand, a crowd of people came running and screaming on the road on Thursday and set a van on fire
 itnaa hi nahin, ve vine driver kii jamkar pitayee karne lage
 The driver was beaten badly
 shahar main afra-tafaripulice ne driver ko ilaaj ke liye ranchi bhej diya, jahaan baad main uski maut ho gai
 Seeing the fire in the van and the angry people, there was an atmosphere of panic and stampede in the city
 logo ko kuch pal ke liye kuch samaj hi nahi aayaa, ki ye shahar main kya ho rahaa he
 At the same time, a firearm reached the spot and tried to extinguish the burning van
 haalanki, tabatak kaaphi der ho chuki thi vine puri tarah jal kar khaak ho chuki thi
 SP Kaushal Kishore of Ramgarh said, "there was a situation of conflict between the two factions here, prompt action has been taken by the police
 magistrate or forces kii maang kii gai he or puure shahar ke andar sthiti puri tareeke se niyantran main he
 Chhotu Verma, a member of the Goraksha Committee, said, 'if the theft of cows, cow slaughter happens in Ramgarh district, the administration remains silent on it
 'is vaardaat se kuch pal ke liye laga maano shahar tham sa gaya, police kii maane to sthiti tanaavpurn he, lekin kaabo main he
 In view of the exaggeration of the incident, the administration has set the police on the scene and around the city
 puraa shahar police chhavnee main tabdeel kar diya gaya he
 Police has registered a case against 12 people in this case
 bahujan samaaj party (BSP) kii mukhiya mayawati ke dilli sthit awaas par samaajawaadee party (SP) pramukh akhilesh yadav ke saath do ghante tak chali unki mulaakaat un daraavne sapanom kaa hissaa jarur hogi, jo bhartiya janata party (BJP) ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ko aate honge
 The heads of both the Uttar Pradesh parties have finalized their alliance on 80 seats in the country's largest state in terms of population - both parties will field candidates in 37-37 seats, three seats of Chaudhary Ajit Singh and Jayant Chaudhary
 The Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) has been left out, and one seat has been decided for the regional Nishad Party
 SP or BSP rajya kii do loksabhaa siton - congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi tathaa UPA adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke sansadeey kshetron amethi or raibareli - main pratyaashee khadey nahin karengi, kyonki congress bhale hi rajya main bane 'mini-gathbandhan' kaa hissaa nahin he, lekin rashtriya chunaav main unheen ke paas sabase zyaada maukey honge
 So, the Congress which recently won in three big states - Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh - has not been completely excluded from the alliance in Uttar Pradesh
 yah or kuch nahin, kisi bhulbhulaiya jaisaa he, or yahi uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti he
 Rahul Gandhi, along with Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav, are aiming to stop the modi-shah duo taking over Uttar Pradesh
 varsh 2009 main congress ne uttar pradesh main 21 loksabhaa siten jiti thim
 He then won just two seats in 2014 and his vote share was just 7
 53 fisadi rah gai, jo mote taur par sirf agadi jatiyon se mili the
 The alliance between Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati has not been formally announced, and Mayawati's close aide Satish Mishra has denied that Behenji's birthday - January 15 - has been chosen for the big announcement
 lekin sutara is baat kii pushti kar rahe hai ki mangalvaar ko hui mulaakaat main sabhi pahaluon ko antim rup de diya gaya he, or iskaa jashn manaane ke liye akhilesh yadav ne parmparik rup se khilaae jane vaale 'ladduon' ke sthaan par 'buaa ji' ko unki pasandida sitafal icecream khilaai
 Rahul Gandhi may not have formally become a part of the anti-bjp front in Uttar Pradesh, but he is believed to have spoken to Akhilesh Yadav to work out a plan in which Congress, BJP The upper castes can break into the votes, and in political terms, can play the role of 'vote katua'
 varsh 2017 main akhilesh yadav ne dobaaraa mukhyamantri pad hasil karne kii kavayad main congress ke saath gathjod kiya tha, lekin nattejey vinaashkari rahe
 BJP won a landslide victory
 tabhi se akhilesh yadav saajheedaar banane ke liye ateet main shatru raheen mayawati kii ore jhuk gaye, or BJP ke garh maane jate rahe ilaakon main ahm upachunaav main unke gathjod ne badi jeet pai, or yah baat sabhi ko samaj aa gai ki agar ve ekajute ho jate hai, to desh main rajnatik rup se sabase zyaada mahatvapurn rajya uttar pradesh ko pradhanmantri narendra modi se vipareet disha main jhukaaya ja saktaa he
 
 
 Apart from the consolidation of votes of Mayawati's Dalits and other backward castes like Akhilesh Yadav's Yadavs, this widely spread belief worked in his favor that Yogi Adityanath (sadhu living in saffron chola) sitting on the throne of Chief Minister ), The Savarnas have been deployed in important administrative and police posts under the rule of the Raja, thereby establishing the 'thakur Raj', which persecutes the small castes
 BJP kii dikkaton ko dobala karne vaale kaarnon main naaraaz sahyogi - apana dal - shaamil he, jisane pichley loksabhaa chunaav main do siten jiti thim
 The Apna Dal says they are entitled to more seats this time, and they will not tolerate being sidelined by the BJP, which has so far not given due respect to its leaders
 hindu voton ko ekajute karne tathaa agadi jatiyon ke voton ko puri tarah BJP ke paksh main karne kii koshishon ke tahat party ke vaicharik sangrakshak kahe jane vaale rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (RSS) ne shart rakhi ki uske bade kaaryakarta samooh va jamini samarthan ke badale party chunaav ke liye govardhan jhadpia ko rajya kaa prabharee niyukt kare
 Zadapia is known for his right-wing views, and has been a staunch critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah
 vah varsh 2002 main gujarat main hue dangon ke dauraan rajya ke grih rajyamantri bhi the
 Yogi Adityanath and Amit Shah have been blasphemous in their speeches about the alliance between Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati, but the rss's intervention shows how seriously the alliance is being taken
 mayawati swabhaav se hathi maani jaati hai, or kathith bhrashtachar ke aaropon main CBI keson kaa saamana karne kii vajah se vah sambhawatah kuch dabaav main bhi hai, isliye vah is bare main saavdhaanee barat rahi hai ki vah kab or kaise apni yojanaon ko saarvajanik karen
 On the other hand, Akhilesh is well aware of how much is at stake, so he too has no problem with this attitude
 is vakt, jab puraa desh chunaav kii tarikhon kii ghoshnaa kaa intazaar kar rahaa he, ahm yojanaayen taiyaar kar lee gai hai
 But remember, often all plans are changed with just one phone call

 The Hurriyat was about to organize a seminar on 'opposition to Indian Fascism', which was attended by representatives of Sikh groups and Christian community, including many separatist leaders
 kuch din pehle hurriyat ke ek pravaktaa ne kaha tha ki har kshetra ke log seminar main apane vichaar rakhenge
 Those who have been invited to Seseminar include Akali Dal (amritsar) leader Simranjit Singh Mann, Dal Khalsa leader Kanwarpal Singh, noted human rights activist Gautam Navlakha and representatives of the Christian community
 upmukhyamantri nirmal singh ne shuukravaar ko jammu main kaha tha ki sarkaar rajya main bharat virdohi gatividhiyon ko anumati nahin degi
 When asked about the seminar, Singh said, 'no such rally or seminar will be allowed on the soil of Jammu and Kashmir

 In order to balance his proximity to Jaitley, Rajnath nominated Rajnath as the only other member of the powerful Appointments Committee of the Cabinet
 phir bhi rajnath ne modi ke sabase vishwaasapaatr amit shah ke liye kursi chhod di
 It is said that Amit Shah wants to be known as a lover of eating poha by squeezing lemon
 poha madhya bharat kaa sabase man pasand naashtaa he
 As soon as he became BJP President, Amit Shah met with big leaders including Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in Nagpur and requested that Sangh workers continue to support the BJP especially in the assembly elections to be held in Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir
 
 sangh ke sanyukt mahasachiv suresh soni ab bhi bijepi or sangh ke bich asardaar sampark sutara hai
 The Sangh has handed over two of its new leaders Ram Madhav and Shiv Prakash to the BJP
 ram madhav chunaav vaale rajyon ke netaaon kii baithak main shaamil bhi ho chuke hai
 Union leaders Bhaiyyaji Joshi and Dattatreya Hosbole, who came to help in the Lok Sabha elections, are now back in the work of the Sangh, but Krishna Gopal, joint general secretary who is a part of this trinity, will probably keep working with the party

 lekin chunaav ke baad se aresas kaa sabase zyada asar uske chaatr sanghathan akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad kii sakriyata main dikhaai diya
 During its National Executive in Mangalore in May, the organization passed a resolution opposing the four-year curriculum of Delhi University
 vidhyaarthee parishad kii netaa sunil ambekar or rohit chahal ne yah prastaav pradhanmantri ko saunpa or kuch hi din baad yah paathyakram radd kar diya gaya
 At times, there is a whisper about the alleged influence of 38-year-old Smriti Irani, the famous daughter-in-law of saas-bahu serials
 satta ke galiyaaron main unka graph bahut teji se chadha he
 Questions are arising whether Amit Shah has a hand on Smriti Irani or the Prime Minister himself? He is said to have an early appointment with the Prime Minister from most leaders
 sanyogvash rajnath singh kii tarah hi unhone bhi apana nijee sachiv aisi adhikari ko chunaa jo upie ke daur ke mantri benny prasad verma ke nijee staff main rah chuki hai
 While Rajnath Singh left the private secretary of his choice, Smriti Irani is firm on her choice, although formal orders have not yet been received
 raashtrapati bhawan ke praangan main 26 may ko modi sarkaar ke shapath-grahan samaaroh main smriti irani kaa naam varisht bijepi netaa harshavardhan se pehle pukaara gaya
 He was even given the crucial human resources ministry over seven-time MP Maneka Gandhi, Minister of Women and Child Development (say, she does not like her ministry) or senior BJP leader Najma Heptulla

 Sushma Swaraj's stars are in an interesting turn in the Modi cabinet
 japan ho yaa srilanka yaa phir china kaa masalaa
 She talks to Modi herself
 lekin is baat se kuch naaraaz bhi hai ki unhen bataae jane se pehle hi pradhanmantri karyaalay ne media ko bataa diya ki modi kii japan yatra radd ho gai he
 Modi was angry with Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar that he was not able to publicize the news properly and as quickly as Foreign Ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin did
 jab javdekar ne apni safai main kaha ki soochna-prasaaran mantralay ke webpej ke bhi hajaaron folover hai to modi kaa tikhaa jawaab tha, shshmain jaanata hum, ye folover kaise banate hai
 Having a few thousand followers does nothing
 ”ab sawaal yah he ki modi kii najar main rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dowaal kii tulana main sushamaa swaraj kahaan hai? khufia beuro ke kadak pramukh rah chuke dowaal kii musiibat yah he ki 2005 main sevanivrutt hone ke baad kareeb ek dashak se ve satta pratishthan se baahar rahe
 He seems to have managed to succeed to some extent in washing the spots on his credit due to his failure to catch the hijackers of Air India aircraft IC814, taken to Kandahar in 1999 by bringing 46 Indian nurses home safely from Iraq
 par bahut kam log jaanate hai ki iraq sankat main kaman dowaal ke haath main nahin, sushamaa swaraj ke haath main thi
 Doval may have gone to Baghdad, but in fact Sushma Swaraj had made all arrangements by sitting in Delhi and talking to the celebrities of West Asia

 Government officials elected by their choice of powerful Hathmodi, from Chief Secretary Nripendra Mishra to Cabinet Secretary Ajit Seth, are perhaps the medium through which Modi wants to give a new face to the country
 manmohan singh dwaara niyukt kiye gaye ajit seth ko seva vistaar diya gaya he, lekin aisa lagata he ki ab unki takat badhegi
 In an attempt to give Financial Services Secretary Gurdial Singh Sandhu the post of Secretary of Urban Development, Seth huffed and appointed Shankar Aggarwal there
 unhone hi kisi mantri ke nijee sachiv ke pad par rahane ke liye paanch varsh kii seemaa vaala aadesh dhundhvaya
 With this, many officers who were in the personal staff of UPA ministers were eliminated

 is bich, kendriya grih rajya mantri hansraj ahir ne suzav diya he ki 'project tiger' kii tarah hi desh main 'project kau' shuru kiya janaa chahie
 Like Tiger Reserve, there should be cow reserves in the country
 ahir ke mutabik jin rajyon main go vadh par pabandi lagu he, vahaan gaayon keabhayaarany (sancturi)banaai jaani chahie
 Ahir says that he has made this suggestion and hopes that the government will consider it
 aaj tak / india today ne is mudde par grih rajya mantri ke saath vistaar se baatcheet kii
 Ahir said, 'I have made suggestions regarding cow reserve or century
 maharashtra main go vadh par pabandi lagi he
 The law is made
 garib kisaanon ko budhi gaay yaa doodh naa dene vaali gaayon ko paalane main dikkat hoti he
 My suggestion is that there is a large forest area in the country
 jahaan ghaas ugta he or vyarth jaataa he
 This grass can be cut and made into a bank
 van kshetra khaali padaa he
 Can make a century on thousands of acres of land
 jis tarah tiger project hai, tiger sancturi hai, usee tarah kau sancturi bhi banaai ja sakati hai
 'ahir made it clear that he has only given suggestions, the government has not considered it
 ahir ke mutabik jab wo vipaksh main the tab bhi yahi baat kehete the
 Ahir said that the kind of blasphemous incidents that have happened in the name of a cow should not have happened
 gaay ke naam par hui hinsak ghatnaon kii pradhanmantri ne bhi ninda kii or grih mantri ne bhi
 Ahir insisted that if his suggestion comes into force, such incidents would also stop
 rajyon main gaay abhayaarany banane par jo kharch hoga, wo kahaan se aayega to is par ahir kaa jawaab tha- 'kharch aane kii baat hi kahaan he
 The country has a large forest area, the grass grows on its own
 aisi dharna rahi he ki van sirf vanya praaniyon ke liye hi hote hai
 i believe that every animal has the right over all natural resources
 barason se wanon main gaay, bhens, bakrii charati ai hai
 But to prevent them from doing so, demands also continue to arise
 'ahir ne kaha kitiger projectoban saktaa he to gaay ke liye bhi ban saktaa he
 Ahir claimed that he had also spoken to Prakash Javadekar, who previously had the environment department, on his suggestion
 iske alaava paryaavaran rajya mantri anil dave se bhi baat kii
 Both of them showed positive attitude
 kuch virgon kii ore se gaay ko rashtriya pashu ghoshit karne kii maang ke bare main ahir se poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki sarkaar se har tarah kii maang naagarik kar sakate hai
 It is a matter of feelings
 desh main anadi kaal se gaay ko pavitra maan kar puja hoti rahi he
 It is the government's job to consider the demand
 beete agast main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii ore se kathith go rakshakon par die gaye bayaan kii ore bhi ahir kaa dhyaan dilaayaa gaya
 In this statement, the Prime Minister said that 70 to 80 percent of the people wearing cow guards wear anti-social activities
 pradhanmantri ne sabhi rajyon ko go rakshakon kaa dogier banane kii bhi salaah di thi
 On this, Ahir said that whoever joins the law, action will be taken
 ahir ne kaha ki gujarat main gaay se judi ghatana par pradhanmantri ne kade shabdon main ninda kii thi
 The recent incident in Rajasthan was also condemned at the top level by the government
 ahir ne kaha ki chaara bahut mahangaa he, garib kisaan anutpaadak gaayon ko paal nahin paata
 That is why the suggestion of a century for cows can be very meaningful
 ajtak / india today ke sting oparation main kathith go rakshakon kaa kaala chittha khulne par ahir ne kaha ki uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne iskaa sangyaan liya he or aisi ghatnaon ko rokane ke liye bharosa diya he

 " The bjp's question, why liberals are silent on the political killings, Barsha belonged to the tribal community and was an active activist of the party in West Medinipur, West Bengal, on Friday, found the body of BJP worker Barsha Hansda hanging from a tree
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kaa daawa he ki barsha adivasee samudaay kaa tha or party kaa sakriy kaaryakarta tha
 The body was brutally murdered and hung on the tree
 bijepi kaa aarope he kitrinmul congresske kaaryakartaaon ne is ghatana ko anjaam diya
 On the incident, BJP tweeted and raised the question that why the liberals are still silent on political killings in this state ruled by Trinamool Congress? Would it have been silent if this had happened in the bjp-ruled state? Barsha Hansda, a tribal BJP worker from Paschim Medinipur, was hanged to death by TMC goons
 Why are the liberals so silent now on these brutal political murders in TMC ruled West Bengal? Would they be so silent if this was a BJP ruled state?pic

 Till the end of the second day's play in the Brisbane Test, knowledgeable and fans were speculating about the Indian victory, but within 24 hours, the situation had changed so much that there was talk of the Indian team saving the Test
 darasal gendbaazon kii karaab line or length ke baad team india ke saamne kai ahm sawaal khadey ho gaye hai
 The manner in which these bowlers continued bowling on the third day in Brisbane proved this aspect of Team India to be hollow once again
 tisare din pehle satr main michel marsh or bread hadine kaa paanchvaan or chatha wicket zarur team india kii jholii main jaldi aayaa, lekin uske baad kangaroo ballebaaz haaavee ho gaye
 Alam was that in the second season the host batsmen added 130 runs and 152 runs in the third season
 yani duusare satr main 23 over main 130 ran to tisare satr main 34
 152 runs in 4 overs
 matlab duusare satr main australian middle order ne 5 ran prati over se zyaada raftaar se ran jode, jabaki talanders ne aakhri satr main 4 ran prati over se zyada raftaar se ran jode
 The statistics testify that Indian bowlers need to do their homework more
 purv captain sunil gavaskar or purv pakistani gendbaaz shoeb akhtar jaise jaankaar is baat se kafa nazar aate hai ki bhartiya gendbaaz galatiyon se seekhney kii koshish nahin kar rahe
 Former captain Sunil Gavaskar says that this is not a new story
 da
 The same happened in Africa and the same happened in New Zealand
 lagata he team india ke paas koi plan-bi tha hi nahin
 The Indian team looked backward about the strategy
 haalanki gendbaaz umesh yadav kehete hai ki gendbaaz koshish kar rahe hai
 He believes that New Zealand or The
 africa main bhi gendbaaz puchhlle ballebaazon ko out karne main naakaam rahe, lekin vah kehete hai ki iskaa matlab ye nahin he ki vah koshish nahin kar rahe hai
 Many times the batsmen are showing a better game, sometimes they are not able to succeed due to luck
 duusare din jo test bharat ke paksh main nazar aa rahaa tha, tisare din bhartiya gendbaazon kii naakaami ne use australia ke paksh main hone par majaboor kar diya

 Chief Commissioner of Railway Safety (CCRS) has finally given its approval for the commercial run on 18 of the country's fastest and fastest running train till date
 sisiares main train 18 ko chalaane ke liye jaruri sefti clearence de diya he
 Earlier, the Electrical Inspector Government of India (EIG) had given provisional approval for this train for just 3 months, which also imposed all conditions, but CCRS has now approved the T-18 train to run regularly
 badhate jhagade ko khatm karne ke liye rail mantri piyush goyal ko aage aana padaa
 After the approval of CCRS, now Train 18 can be run between Delhi to Varanasi on any day
 sisiares kii manjuuri main rajdhani ke liye upyukt rail maarg par is train ko 160 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar par chalaane kii anumati di gai he to vahiin iske alaava kisi duusare rail maarg par ise 105 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar se chalaane kii manjuuri mili he
 Battle of 2 departments behind the delay, however, there was a dispute between the two departments of Mechanical and Electrical of the railway behind the delay regarding the safety clearance of T-18
 isief chennai main taiyaar kii gai is train ko railway kaa electrical department apni manjuuri dena kanoonee maanata he, lekin maikenical vibhaag ke logon kaa kahana he ki is tarah kii manjuuri kii vaidhanik baadhyataa nahin he
 After the CCRS inspection on December 19 and 20 last year, when the dispute caught fire, the Electrical Inspector was asked for EIG clearance from the Government of India
 23 janvari ko iaiji ne apni sahmati di to vah bhi proviginal tareeke se 3 maheene ke liye vah bhi tamaam sharton ke saath
 All conditions for the approval
 Now let us tell you how the Electrical Department linked this provisional approval with all the conditions and T-18 was approved by the Electrical Inspector Government of India for a commercial run for just 3 months with some conditions
 
 iaiji kii manjuuri ke liye 23 janvari ko die gaye patr main kaha gaya tha ki is train ke oparation or mentanence ko manjuuri proviginal di gai he
 This approval has been given under the Indian Electricity Act 2003 and the Central Electricity Authority Amendment Regulations 2010 / 2018 relating to safety
 is manjuuri ke liye electrical inspector ne sharten lagaai thi
 The Electrical Inspector Government of India (EIG) had stated that HT Termination for high voltage in train 18 and LT control power cabling for low voltage should be properly separated
 iske liye hitansion vir ke cubical ko puri tarah se alag banaaya janaa chahie, yahaan par yah bhi kaha gaya ki vaikum circuit braker (visibi) or duusare switchs ko hai voltage or lo voltage main ek saath na rakhkar sefti ke lihaaj se alag-alag rakhaa janaa chahie
 The second thing in the Electrical Inspector report suggests work with IS standards
 report main kaha gaya ki electrical cabel kii proper color koding kii jaani chahie or saath hi aies maanakon ke tahat arthing bhi kii jaani chahie
 It was advised to protect the 25 kv hightion cable on the roof of this train in a mechanical way
 saath hi yah bhi kaha gaya ki ek coach se duusare coach main jate vakt is cabel ko sahi dhang se saport diya janaa chahie
 The report said that the feeding cable between the pantograph to the pantograph is electrically unprotected, so in the event of an electric fault, a proper protection scheme should be made so that the traction sub stations do not trip
 electrical inspector ne apni report main kaha tha ki train-18 ke sabhi mukhya upkarnon kii prototip testing 3 maheene ke bheetar kii jaani chahie
 The time line for all these stings should be fixed within a week
 isi ke saath yah bhi kaha gaya ki fire sefti plan or train main oechai fail hone kii sthiti main logon ko train se baahar nikaalane ke liye aavashyak yojana bhi deni hogi
 The Electrical Inspector also stated that the diesel loco shed Shakurbasti does not have the necessary infrastructure to maintain 25 kv traction equipment
 isliye is train ko iemyu or memu trainon ke mentanence sad main mentanence ke liye rakhaa janaa chahie
 The EIG also pointed out the concerns in the provisional permit letter of the EIG that there were serious flaws in the design and testing of the train's electrical subsystem
 lihaaja is train ko anbhavi suparvizer ke supervijan main rakhaa janaa chahie or isamen aise staff lagaae jane chahie jinako 25 kevi asi trection or sambandhit system chalaane kii training di gai ho
 Before the commercial run, the qualification and experience of such staff running the train will have to be given in this office
 train 18 chalaane vaale staff ko agle 3 maheene tak har trip ke baad objarveshans ke detail iaiji ko bhejne honge
 He also said that the current permission is provisional and only for 3 months
 saath hi yah bhi hidaayat di gai ki 7 din ke andar saare dacuments or sahmati patr certificate skim ko unke paas jamaa karnaa hoga jisase tay kiya ja sake paisanger kii sefti paryaapt he yaa nahin
 In response to the letter of Electrical Inspector EIG, which is exceeding its limits, the Principal Chief Mechanical Engineer of ICF wrote a letter to the Principal Chief Mechanical Engineer of Northern Railway and said that many things do not come under the purview of EIG inspection
 lekin yah kaha gaya ki ek maheene ke andar maangi gai sabhi jaankaree unhen de di jaaegi
 The letter also cited that as per the 16 May 2016 Gazette notification, equipment and installations up to 11 KV are approved through self certification and this self certification has already been given to the Railway Board
 is patr main kaha gaya ki nordarn railway ke iaiji inspection main 11kv se zyada ke upkarnon kaa nirikshan kiya janaa chahie tha
 It has been clearly written in the letter that the inspection of the Electrical Inspector is confined to the primary winding only from the pantograph
 iske alaava sab kuch self certyphoid he jo ki kanuunan he
 If anything more than this, the Electrical Inspector brings it under his inspection, then it is exceeding its limit and it can be considered equal to Inspector Raj
 rail mantri ne banaaya dabaavaisief ke is patr se saaf-saaf pataa chalata he ki kis tarah se railway ke do department electrical or maikenical aapas main ek duusare ke adhikaar kshetra ko chunauti de rahe hai
 However, let us tell you that when these two departments came face-to-face, then once again it seemed that the approval of train 18 was going to fall in the sour once again
 vivaad ke bich railway ke adhikariyon ko ankush main laane ke liye rail mantri kii taraf se dabaav banaaya gaya or uske baad bich kaa rasta nikaala ja sakaa
 An approval letter was signed by the Principal Chief Electrical Engineer and Principal Chief Mechanical Engineer of Northern Railway named as EIG
 patr main yah likhaa gaya ki sabhi takneekee muddon ko dekha jayega
 As far as possible and with this, these will be included in the next Rex of Train 18 in the coming days
 jab yah patr chif kamishnar aaf railway sefti ko diya gaya to uske baad train 18 ke regular commercial ran ke liye sefti certificate jari kiya gaya

 bharat ke mukhya nyaayamurti deepak mishra ke khilaaf mahabhiyog prastaav khaarij kiye jane ke masale ko congress supreme court main jane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 Speaking to Aaj Tak, Rajya Sabha MP KTS Tulsi said that now there is a way to go to the court on this matter
 is dauraan tulsi ne mukhya nyaayamurti deepak mishra ke khilaaf mahabhiyog ke prastaav ko venkaiya naidu dwaara khaarij kiye jane ko bhi galat bataaya
 He said, "I have seen the decision of Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu on the impeachment motion
" mere vichaar se yah thik nahin he
 Article 124 of the Constitution of India provides for the process of impeachment against the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
 '' tulsi ne kaha ki samvidhan ke anuchhed 124 ke mutabik sansad ke sadan main voting ke baad mahabhiyog prastaav ko raashtrapati ke samaksh pesh karnaa hota he
 It has to see whether the malpractice is proved against the justice
 iske baad Judges Inquiry Act hai, jisamen kai niyam hai
 There is a process of calling witnesses and gathering documents
 unhone kaha ki mukhya nyaayamurti ke khilaaf mahabhiyog ko lekar sansad kii cameti apni report detii he
 Tulsi said that the logic of giving all the evidence at the time of giving impeachment motion is not correct
 saansadon ke paas itane sansaadhan nahin hai ki pehle puraa trial karke saboot liye jaaen
 We cannot even call witnesses
 unhone kaha ki mahabhiyog prastaav ko primeor bataanaa samvidhan ke tahat puri tarah galat he
 KTS Tulsi says that the reasons stated by Rajya Sabha Chairman Naidu while rejecting the impeachment motion are not valid
 iske interpritesan karne main galati hui he
 The committee could see more evidence yet, but they did not consider it
 keties tulsi ne kaha ki ham is par aage kii ranneeti par vichaar karenge? saath hi bharat ke mukhya nyaayamurti deepak mishra kii adaalat main kisi bhi maamle main pesh nahin honge
 Tulsi said that we cannot say anything against the pride of BJP
 is prastaav ko khaarij kiye jane kii pehle se hi yojana thi
 However, this impeachment motion was quite strong
 is par karrwai honi chahie thi
 Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati has refused to consider Sai Baba of Shirdi as God, making a controversial statement
 unhone sai ko hindu-muslim ekta kaa pratik maanane se bhi manaa kar diya or kaha ki unki puja ko badhaava dena hindu dharm ko baantne kii sajeesh he
 Shankaracharya also opposed the construction of Sai Baba's temple
 unhone kaha ki jo shiridy ke sai baba kii puja ko badhaava de rahe hai ve chaahate hai ki hindu dharm kamjor ho
 He alleged that money is being earned in the name of Sai Baba
 shankaracharya ke is bayaan se sai baba main aasthaa rakhane waalon ke naaraaz hone kii ashanka he

 kisi naa kisi saamagree ko kisi naa kisi bhagwaan ko chadhaanaa nishedh he jaise tulsi ko kunku nahin chadhataa or shiv ko haldi nahin chadhati
 If Ganesha does not climb Tulsi, then Durga is not offered to Durga, but rice is offered to every god
 bhagwaan ko chaaval chadhaate samay yah dhyaan rakhana chahie ki chaaval toote hue na hon
 Akshata is a symbol of perfection, so all rice should be unbroken

 Rice should be clean and hygienic

 Accept this and accept the spirit of the devotee
 puja main akshat chadhaane kaa abhipraay yah he ki hamaara pujan akshat kii tarah purna ho
 While being superior in food, while offering it to God, there is a feeling that whatever food we receive is received by the grace of God
 at: hamaare andar yah bhaavana bhi bani rahe
 Its white color symbolizes peace
 at: hamaare prayek kaary kii purnataa aisi ho ki uskaa fal hamen shanti pradaan kare

 First the face of the government changed, now the face of the organization will change

 The formal announcement is yet to be made
 mishan 2014 ko dekhte hue rahul ke kad ko badhaane kii taiyaari to shuru ho gai he, lekin kya wo puri roshni vaale chaudaavin ke chand sabit honge, ye sabase bada sawaal he
 'rahul wants to work for the Youth Congress' The time the Congress has been waiting for years is just about to come
 ab tak congress main choti moti bhoomikaaon kii khol main simate rahul gandhi ke kad ko bada banane kii taiyaari par bas lagane hi vaali he muhar
 a glimpse of the decision was seen on Sunday when the appearance of the Manmohan Singh government changed, but the face of Rahul Gandhi emerged
 badlaav kii aahat main rahul gandhi kii shakhsiyat majboot dikhne lagi
 No one has ever been suspicious of Rahul Gandhi's dominance over the Congress, but the way Rahul walked in the last major reshuffle before the Lok Sabha elections, it became clear that the Congress will be the biggest maharathi in the 2014 election Mahabharata
 sarkaar main shaamil rahul brigade ke mantriyon ne congress ke is betaj badshaah ke kad ko jaahir karne main der nahin lagaai
 After the reshuffle in the Rahul Manmohan government, the most talked about thing is the change to strengthen the Congress organization
 mana ja rahaa he ki congress ke rashtriya mahasachiv rahul ko party kaa kaaryakari adhyaksh yaa upaadhyaksh banaaya ja saktaa he
 It is also discussed that by making Rahul the post of Secretary General of the Congress, his stature and dominance can be increased

 Manmohan Singh may be the Prime Minister for eight years, but most Congress leaders consider Rahul as the future of the party
 aise main aadhikarik taur par agar rahul ko congress main number do kii kursi par bithaaya jaataa he, to sirf party par dabadabaa hi nahin kad bhi puure shabaab par hoga
 Rahularahul Gandhi, who has been working for the organization for the last 5 years, has political potential

 Rahul has been working for the organization for the last five years
 yuvaaon ko tarjeeh dete hai
 The list of those close to him is different among the leaders, but even with all these characteristics, the answer to a question is not made whether Rahul's coin will run on the voters
 sarkaar kii shakl badal kar rahul gandhi ne ye sandesh de diya ki unhone 2014 loksabhaa chunaavon kii taiyaariyaan abhi se hi shuru kar di
 Before the most difficult examination, the Congress played its biggest bet, but the question is whether Rahul Gandhi will be able to succeed in this difficult test? If the political experts are to be believed, then the exercise of strengthening the organization will be effective only when it is constantly tried
 rahul gandhi ko cabinet main laana chahta tha: pradhanmantriisse pehle hindi pattee main congress ko phir se taqatvar banane kaa naakaam daanv rahul khel chuke hai
 The failure of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh put a question mark on his charisma
 jaankaron kii maane to aam logon se aasaani se jud paane main naakaami unke liye baari padi
 The knowledgeable should say anything, but in the political circles, the Congress has definitely given the message of preparing Rahul's team
 jaahir he sarkaar or sanghathan main yuva chehron ko kaam karne kaa mauka milegaa to party ko apni chhavi sudhaarney kaa mauka bhi milegaa

 2012 main jahaan aise maamalon kii sankhya 589 thi, vahiin 2013 main yah badhkar 1,203 ho gai
 This cannot be construed that the number of cases registered under the Information Technology (IT) Act-2000 is increasing due to the increase in the number of smartphone users and especially the number of applications based on Android operating system
 march main sanchaar or iti mantri ravi shankar prasad ne sansad main kaha tha ki mobile phone kii sankhya badhane se sibar aparaadh main betahasha vruddhi hui he
 Pornography through desktops and laptops has been sent before smartphones, but it is a bit complicated

 ' enciarabi ke anusaar, yahi kaaran he ki aise aparaadh sirf bade shaharon tak hi simit nahin hai

 iti adhinium main sibar aparaadh ko nau shreniyon main vargeekrut kiya gaya he

 2013 main sibar aparaadh ke 4,356 maamalon main se 3,719 maamle hekking or gande prakashnon ke hai
 As smartphone usage has increased, so has the proliferation of dirty materials

 According to a 2012 report by us-based venture-capital consulting company Kleiner Perkins Coffee and Byers (KPCB), the number of smartphone users in the country stood at 4 in 2012
 4 karod thi, jo ek saal se bhi kam samay main 10 karod ko paar kar gai
 In 2013, India has around 11 smartphone users
 7 karod ke saath sirf china or america se peeche he
 Also, the country's mobile Internet usage surpassed desktop Internet usage in 2013, with an 81 percent year-on-year increase in mobile data usage

 The youth are generally not aware that the exchange of dirty material is a crime
 internet and mobile association of india main sibar suraksha visheshgy or salaahkaar rakshit tandon ne kaha ki sasti internet yojana or saste smartphone ke saath sibar aparaadh kii jaankaree nahin hone se gandi saamagree kaa aadan-pradaan bad rahaa he
 Tandon said, 'people are unaware of the legal aspects related to internet usage
 ve sochate hai ki ve jo bhi kar rahe hai vah sirf ve hi jaanate hai, lekin yah saarvajanik rahata he or shikaayat milane par police karrwai kar sakati he
 ' gandi samagriyon ke aadan-pradaan se sambandhit iti adhinium kii dhara 67 kaa ulanghan karne ke aropiyon main 18 se 45 saal ke yuvaaon kii sankhya kaaphi adhik he
 Of the 737 people arrested for the exchange of such materials in 2013, 660 were from the same age group
 tippaniyan Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said that the government is aware of this
 unhone kaha ki soshal netwarking site par najar rakhane ke liye koi vishesh faisla nahin liya gaya he
 Many agencies, however, monitor such sites and remove objectionable material on the advice of the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (cert-in)

 Like every year, this time also, the festival of Narasimha Chaturdashi is being celebrated all over the world on the Chaturdashi of Shukla Paksha of Vaishakh month
 halanki is mahaparv ke bare main bahut kam logon ko hi jaankaree he lekin, is tithi ko shastron main behad mahatvapurn bataaya gaya he
 There is a description in the scriptures that on the same date, Lord Narasimha appeared
 shrimad bhagwatam ke saatven skanda main bhi bhagwan narsingh ke avataran kaa varnan aata he
 An extremely cruel demon named Hiranyakashipu had done penance for 36 thousand years and forced him to boon
 uski kathor tapasya se khush brahma ji ne hiranyakashiphu ko amartv ke bilkul nazadik vardaan bhi diya
 He did not water, nor land, day nor night, nor any weapon, nor weapon, outside the house nor in the sky, nor any creature created by Brahma, from Brahma ji
 Had taken the boon of not dying
 aisa vardaan maang kar wo aashwast ho gaya ki vah ab amar ho gaya he
 But he forgot that no matter how clever a person is, the intelligence of God is manifold
 hiranyakashiphu kaa putr prahlaad bhagwan vishnu kaa param bhakt tha
 He always praised, discussed and preached God
 na keval dusron ko, balki vah nirbhay hokar apane mata-pita ko bhi bhagwan kii bhakthi ke liye prerit karata tha
 Hiranyakashipu who was so blinded by his wealth, opulence and power that even the words of his younger son seemed very bitter
 yahi vajah thi kii usne apane hi putr ko maarane kaa man bana liya tha
 According to the scriptures, to protect his supreme devotee Prahlad, Narasimha Avatar from the pillar, who was half male and half lion, appeared in that form and killed Hiranyakashipu
 bhagavvaan ko ye adbhut rup dhaaran karne ke peeche bhi kai kaaran hai
 The lion is known to reveal fury
 vaise hi hiranyakashiphu ke prahlaad kii taraf pratarna ko dekh ke bhagwan atyadhik rosh main the
 He took the form of a lion to reveal it
 vadh ke baad jab sabhi devi-devtaa bhaybheet the, tab prahlaad ne aage bad ke unako shant kiya or bhagwan ne apane singh mukh se prahlaad ko chaat kar ke apana sneh dikhaaya
 The comments narsingh chaturdashi bhagwan kii bhakt vatsalya dharm ke prati katibaddhta evam unki bhagavadta ko pradarshit karata he
 Rukmani Krishna Das, President of ISKCON Temple, Punjabi Bagh, Delhi, told that in this festival, devotees keep the fast till evening, anoint Narasimha Bhagavan in the evening and recite the Narasimha Leela and receive the offerings and offer their blessings to the Lord
 Can
 bhagwaan narsingh ko vighn vinaashak bhi kaha jaataa he, jo hamaare bhakthimay jivan main aane vaali sabhi baadhaon ko samaapt karte hai, isliye bhakt un se apane hriday main vidyaman hiranyakashiphu jaise asur ko samaapt karne kii prarthana karte hai
 Although this form of God appears to be terrible, but it is very beautiful and showing love for the devotees
 shastron main varnan aata he ki isi tithi ko bhagwan narsingh kaa prakatya hua tha
 In the seventh skanda of Srimad Bhagavatam, there is a description of the incarnation of Bhagwan Narasimha
 hiranyakashiphu naamak atyant krur rakshas ne brahma ji kii 36 hazaar varshon tak tapasya karke unhen vardaan dene par baadhya kar diya tha
 Happy with his harsh penance, Brahma also gave Hiranyakashipu a boon very close to immortality
 usne brahma ji se na jal, na thal, na din, na raat main, na kisi astr se, na shastr se, na ghar ke bahaar na andar, na zamin par na akaash main, na hi brahma ke dwaara banaaye gaye kisi bhi jeev ke dwaara na marane kaa vardaan le liya tha
 By demanding such a boon, he became convinced that he has now become immortal
 lekin vah bhul gaya ki koi kitna bhi hoshiyaar ho, bhagwan kii hoshiyaari usase kai guna hoti he
 Prahlad, the son of Hiranyakashipu, was an ardent devotee of Lord Vishnu
 vah sadaiv bhagwan kaa gungan, unki charchaa va unka prachaar karata tha
 Not only the others, but he also used to fearlessly inspire his parents for devotion to God
 hiranyakashiphu jo apane dhan, aishwarya or shakti se itnaa andhaa ho chukaa tha ki apane chote se putr kii baaten bhi kaaphi kadavi lagati thim
 This was the reason that he had made up his mind to kill his own son

 There are many reasons behind Bhagwavan taking this wonderful form
 rosh ko prakat karne ke liye sher janaa jaataa he
 In the same way, Bhagavan was in extreme rage after seeing Pratirana towards Prahlad of Hiranyakashipu
 ise prakat karne ke liye unhone singh kaa rup dhaaran kiya
 After the slaughter, when all the gods and goddesses were frightened, Prahlad stepped forward and pacified them and Bhagavan showed his affection by licking Prahlada with his lion face

 Jeevati was only 14 years old when one night she was taken from a family 'for getting married' to a man, according to which Jeevati's family took a loan of US $ 1000
 
 
 jivati ko maa ameri kaashi kohli ko puraa bharosa he ki shaadi ke liye nahin, uski beti ko 'kabhi khatm na hone vaale' karz kii vasuuli ke liye le jaaya gaya
 
 
 According to Ameri, when she came to work here, she and her husband took a loan of about US $ 500 from the zamindar, but she then claims that the loan had been repaid
 
 
 vaise, dakshini pakistan main aisi bahut-si kahaniyaan sunne ko milanaa katai aam baat he
 
 
 Small loans turn into impossible amounts, and the amount paid never decreases
 
 
 is duniya main ameri or uski beti jaisi mahilaayein sampatti samajhi jaati he, jinhen kabhi karz ke bhugtan ke rup main le liya jaataa he, to kabhi jhagade nipataane kii khatir
 
 
 Sometimes they are used to take revenge, sometimes as punishment given by the zamindar to the laborers
 
 
 kabhi-kabhi to maa-baap khud hi 'kabhi khatm na hone vaale' karz ke khatme ke liye apni beti de dene kii peshkash kar baithte hai
 
 
 Having acquired these girls, these men consider their pride
 
 
 ve sabase sundar dikhne vaali, sabase choti umr kii, or sabase zyaada dabbu kism kii ladakiyon ko chunate hai
 
 
 Sometimes they keep her as a second wife, so that they can take care of their homes
 
 
 kabhi-kabhi ve un ladakiyon ko veshyavriti main dhakel dete hai, taaki ve paisa kamakar unhen de saken
 
 
 Sometimes they are taken away just because they are capable of doing so
 
 
 dharm se hindu ameri kahati he, "main police ke paas bhi gai, or adaalat main bhi
 
 
 Nobody listens to our complaint
 
 
 " uskaa kahana he ki zameendaar ne uski beti kaa dharmaparivartan karwaakar use muslim bana liya, or phir use duusari bivi ke taur par rakh liya
 
 
 Ameri said, "they told us, 'your daughter has accepted Islam, and now you cannot get her back
 
 
 '" According to the Global Slavery Index of 2016, more than two million Pakistanis are living as 'modern slaves'
 
 
 index ke anusaar, logon ko gulam banaakar rakhane ke maamle main pakistan aaj bhi duniya main tisare paaydaan par he, jahaan kuch logon ko khet-mazdoor banaakar rakhaa jaataa he, kuch ko eenton ke bhatte par, or kuch ko gharelu naukar banaakar rakhaa jaataa he
 
 
 They are beaten, and sometimes these 'slave' laborers are held in chains so that they cannot escape
 
 
 pakistan main bandhua mazaduron ko azaad karwaane ke makasad se kaam kar rahi green rural deveopment organizeshan se jude gulam haidar kaa kahana he, "unke paas koi adhikaar nahin hote, or unki biviyon, betiyon par ghaat lagaana sabase aasaan hota he
 
 
 " south asia partnership organizeshan kii ek report ke mutabik pakistan main har saal lagbhag 1,000 hindu tathaa isai ladakiyon, jinamein se zyaadaatar naaballig hoti hai, ko unke gharon se nikaal liya jaataa he, unhen musalmaan banaaya jaataa he, or unase shaadi kar lee jaati he
 
 
 Haider explained, "they always sort pretty girls
 
 
 " The night the Jivati disappeared, the whole family was sleeping outside the house, as this is the only way to escape the heat in southern Sindh province
 
 
 subah uthne par pataa chalaa, jivati gaayab he
 
 
 Her mother says, no one heard anything
 
 
 iske baad parivaar ne kaaryakarta vero kohli se madad kii guhaar kii, taaki ladki ko azaad karavaaya ja sake
 
 
 Vireo has no relationship with Amery's family, and she herself was born as a slave
 
 
 varsh 1999 main bandhua mazaduri se azaad ho jane ke baad unhone apana jivan taqatvar zameendaaron ko chunauti dene ke liye samarpit kar diya, or vah hazaron pariwaron ko bandhua mazaduri se nijaat dilava chuki hai
 
 
 In a country that has been citing male-dominated culture for centuries, it is not easy for men to stand against them in this way
 
 
 vero kaa kahana he, "main jaanati hum, ve mujhe maar daalana chaahate hai
 
 
 But i will not stop fighting to get these people free
 
 
 " Five months ago Vireo Piero accompanied Ameri went to the police station to find Jivati
 
 
 police waalon ne kaha ki jivati apni marzi se gai he
 
 
 Vireo reported, "I told her, 'if she has gone on her own, let me talk to her, let her mother talk to her'," but she refuses
 
 
 " After this, instead of contacting Jeevati, the policemen called the man Hamid Brohi, who according to Ameri took his daughter
 
 
 vero bataati hai, iske baad hamid brohi akelaa aayaa, jivati ko lekar nahin, or aakar bolaa, "vah (jivati) bhugtan he un ek lakh rupayon (1,000 america dollar) kaa, jo tumne mujhe chukaane the
 
 
 " iske baad vero baar-baar usee police stesan pahunch jaati thi, jahaan police adhikari akil ahamed use dekhakar bahut mushkil se apane gusse ko filon ke dher main chhipate the, or aakhir ek din unhone usee dher main se ek affidavit nikaala, or vero ko dikhaaya
 
 
 In the affidavit, Jeevati, popularly known as Fatima after conversion, had converted to Islam at her own will, marrying Hamid at her own will
 
 
 usamen yah bhi likhaa tha ki vah apni maa se isliye nahin mil sakati, kyonki vah ab musalmaan he, or uskaa mul parivaar hindu tha
 
 
 Hindu activists say that these girls are kept in hiding after being picked up until they are forcibly converted and married
 
 
 or aisa ho chukne ke baad kuch bhi karnaa mumkin nahin rah jaataa
 
 
 But ultimately under pressure, the police had to take Vireo and a foreign journalist to Jeevati in a jeep loaded with machine guns
 
 
 jivati kii maa police kaa phir saamana karne se dar rahi thi, so, vah nahin gai
 
 
 Hamid Brohi, who looked like an irritable and fine-looking mustache, got a welcome from the police
 
 
 police stesan main kiye gaye daawey ke ain ulat vahaan apane ghar par usne gusse main bharkar is baat se inkaar kiya ki usne jivati ko karze ke bhugtan ke taur par uthaaya tha
 
 
 Inside, Jiviti was found sitting on a mattress lying on the ground
 
 
 uske sir par kaale rang kaa shawl lipta hua tha
 
 
 There was heavy makeup on the eyes, a thick layer of scarlet lipstick was seen on the lips as well
 
 
 bilkul usee tarah, jaise kisi bacchee ne maa kii mechap kit istemaal kii ho, yaa koi ladki jaanboojhkar apni umr zyaada dikhaane kii koshish kar rahi ho
 
 
 Though she did not look scared at all, her eyes were fixed on the same door, where her husband continued to hover
 
 
 jab vah boli, to saaf laga, jaise kai-kai baar bolne kaa riyaaz karavaaya gaya he
 
 
 Jeevati said, "I married him, because i wanted to do that
 
 
 maine khud unase yah baat kahi thi ki ham donon ek-duusare se pyaar karte hai, to hamen shaadi kar leni chahie
 
 
 Then he said, 'come on, let's get married
 
 
 ' or maine kaha, 'haa
 
 
 '" jivati ne is baat se inkaar kiya ki usne apni maa ko ghar chhodane ke baad se nahin dekha he, lekin vah yah nahin bataa pai ki usne aakhri baar apni maa ko kahaan dekha tha - yaa vah ab rahati kahaan he, kyonki purana ghar ve chhodkar ja chuke hai
 
 
 She remained silent even when she was asked why she refused to visit her mother because of her confession to Islam, according to an affidavit in court
 
 
 jivati ne kaha ki use nahin pataa ki court ke dastauez main kya likhaa he, haalanki police ne har dastauez dikhaate hue yahi daawa kiya tha ki ye sabhi baaten jivati ne khud kahi thim
 
 
 The comments agle din vahaan pahunche donon log - vero or videshi patrkaar - laut jate hai, bina police kii gaadi ke
 
 
 
 
 
 or us vakt us dalan ke bheetar sirf auraten hi auraten thim, jinamein se koi bhi fatima ko nahin jaanati
 
 
 The room in which Jivati was sitting the previous day was locked
 
 
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki is ghar ko jivati se yah sab kahalwane ke liye hi stage ke taur par taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 
 
 According to Ameri, when she came to work here, she and her husband took a loan of about US $ 500 from the zamindar, but she then claims that the loan had been repaid

 Jeevati said, "I married him, because i wanted to do that

 Ghulam Haider, who is associated with the Green Rural Development Organization, working for the liberation of bonded laborers in Pakistan, says, "they have no rights, and it is easiest to ambush their wives and daughters
" 
 
 " According to a report by the South Asia Partnership Organization, every year in Pakistan, about 1,000 Hindu and Christian girls, most of whom are minors, are expelled from their homes, converted to Muslims, and married
 
 
 haidar ne bataaya, "ve hameshaa sundar-sundar ladkiyaan chhaantate hai
 
 
 " jis raat jivati gaayab hui, puraa parivaar ghar ke baahar so rahaa tha, kyonki dakshini sindh praant main garmi se bachane kaa yahi ekmaatr upaay he
 
 
 Revealed upon waking up in the morning, Jeevati is missing
 
 
 uski maa kahati he, kisi ne kuch bhi nahin suna
 
 
 After this, the family requested the help of activist Vireo Kohli, so that the girl could be freed
 
 
 vero kaa ameri ke parivaar se koi rishta nahin he, or vah khud bhi gulam ke rup main paidaa hui thim
 
 
 After being freed from bonded labor in 1999, she devoted her life to challenging powerful landlords, and she has got thousands of families out of bonded labor

 Vireo says, "I know, they want to kill me
" 
 
 lekin main in logon ko azaad karwaane ke liye ladanaa band nahin karuungi
 
 
 " paanch maheene pehle ameri ko saath lekar vero piyaaro lundh police stesan gai, taaki jivati ko dhundha ja sake
 
 
 Policemen said that Jeevati had gone on her own
 
 
 vero ne bataaya, "maine unase kaha, 'agar vah apni marzi se gai he, to mujhe usase baat karne do, uski maa ko usase baat karne do', lekin unhone inkaar kar diya
 
 
 " iske baad jivati se sampark karwaane ke sthaan par police waalon ne us shaks hamid brohi ko bulawaaya, jo ameri ke mutabik uski beti ko le gaya
 
 
 After this Vero says, Hamid Brohi came alone, not with Jeevati, and came and said, "that (jeevati) is the payment of one lakh rupees (US $ 1,000), which you had to pay me
 
 
 " After this, Vireo repeatedly reached the same police station, where police officer Akeel Ahmad, on seeing him, very rarely hid his anger in a pile of files, and finally one day he took out an affidavit from the same pile, and showed Viro
 
 
 
 affidavit main likhaa tha, jivati, jise dharmaparivartan ke baad fatima naam se janaa jaataa he, ne apni marzi se islam kabool kiya tha, apni marzi se hamid se shaadi kii thi
 
 
 It also wrote that she could not meet her mother because she is now a Muslim, and her original family was Hindu
 
 
 hindu kaaryakartaaon kaa kahana he ki in ladakiyon ko uthaa le jane ke baad tab tak chhipaakar rakhaa jaataa he, jab tak unka jabaran dharmaparivartan or shaadi na kara di jaae
 
 
 And once this happens, it is no longer possible to do anything
 
 
 lekin aakhirkaar dabaav main police ko mashinagan se yukt ek jeep main vero or ek videshi patrkaar ko jivati ke paas le janaa padaa
 
 
 Jeevati's mother was afraid to face the police again, so she did not go
 
 
 vahaan mila shakl se hi chidchida dikhne vaala or baarik-si moonch rakhane vaala hamid brohi, jisane police vaale kaa swaagat gale lagakar kiya
 
 
 In sharp contrast to the claim made at the police station, he angrily denies that he raised Jeevati as a payment of debt
 
 
 bheetar, zamin par hi bichhe ek gadde par jivati baithi mili
 
 
 a black shawl was wrapped over his head
 
 
 ankhon par baari mechap tha, honton par bhi laal rang kii lipstick kii moti parat dikh rahi thi
 
 
 In the same way as if a girl has used a mother's makeup kit, or a girl is deliberately trying to show her age
 
 
 haalanki vah dari hui bilkul nahin lag rahi thi, lekin uski ankhen usee darvaaze par tiki hui thim, jahaan uskaa shuhar lagaataar mandaraata rahaa
 
 
 When she spoke, it became clear, as if several times have been made to speak
 
 
 jivati ne kaha, "maine unase shaadi kii, kyonki main aisa chaahati thi
 
 
 i myself told him that if we both love each other, then we should get married
 
 
 phir unhone kaha, 'chalo, shaadi kar lete hai
 
 
 'and i said,' Yes
 
 
 '" Jeevati denied that she had not seen her mother since she left home, but she could not tell where she had last seen her mother - or where she lived now, as they left the old house Have gone 
 
 vah tab bhi chup rahi, jab usase poocha gaya ki court main die affidavit ke mutabik usne islam kabool kar lene kii vajah se apni maa se milane se inkaar kyon kiya tha
 
 
 Jeevati said that she does not know what is written in the court document, although the police had shown every document, claiming that all these things were said by Jeevati herself
 
 
 tippaniyan The next day, the two men - heroics and foreign journalists - return without a police car
 
 
 
 
 
 And at that time there were only women inside that hallway, none of whom knew Fatima
 
 
 jis kamare main jivati pichley din baithi thi, us par taala jadaa hua tha
 
 
 It seemed that this house was prepared as a stage only to call it all by living
