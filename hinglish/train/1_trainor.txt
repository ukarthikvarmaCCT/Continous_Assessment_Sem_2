 As illustrated by the Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's visit to Delhi in September, the relationship is now reaching a new level of maturity, which is being driven by shared economic interests, the lives of the people of both countries and strategic constraints

 In this way, Modi's visit will be related to further strengthening of the already strong relationship more than initiating the partnership
 is koshish main paisa yaa satta utani kaam nahin aegi jitani ki saamaanya logon kii hissedari
 The important moment of the visit will not be a speech in Canberra, an announcement on a new mining partnership or a strategic exercise, but more importantly a moment when Modi will address more than 15,000 Indian-origin Australians at the Sydney Olympic Stadium
 yah anubhav neuyork ke medisson skhwaayar garden ke anubhav jaisaa hoga yaa mumkin he, us par bhi baari pad jaae

 bharat band kii apil kis dal ne kii thi, iskaa pataa lagaana jaruri he, kyonki tamaam vipakshi dalon ko bhi iskaa jawaab nahin maaloom he
 From Sunday to Monday, he has been clarifying that he has not appealed for the Bharat Bandh
 ravivaar ko uttar pradesh ke kushinagar kii raily main pradhanmantri modi ne kaha ki ek taraf sarkaar bhrashtachar ke saare raste band karne main lagi hai, kaale dhan ke saare raste band karne main lagi he, to duusari taraf log bharat band karnaa chaahate hai
 You tell me that the path of corruption should be closed that India should be closed
 pradhanmantri ke is bayaan ke baad vipaksh saboot maangane laga ki kisne bharat band kii apil kii he
 Did the media and social media on its part call separate protest programs of November 28 as Bharat Bandh? bijepi ke liye bhi sabit karnaa koi mushkil nahin he
 The BJP can closely study all the press conferences and press releases of 24 November when the 28 November program was announced
 hamane kai dalon kaa dekha he, daawa to nahin kar sakate lekin jitna dekha usamen kisi main bharat band kaa zikr nahin he
 On November 24, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala had said that the Congress would celebrate the public outrage across the country
 24 ko hi seetaram yechuri kaa bayaan he ki 28 november ko kai dal desh bhar main aakrosh diwas manaayenge
 On 24 November, CPI leader d Raja had said that the Left parties would hold a week-long protest from 24 November to 30 November
 sipiem kii website par ek press release he jo 23 november ko jari hui he
 It clearly states that the 6 Left parties have decided that a week of protests will take place
 press release main bharat band shabd hi nahin he
 After the Prime Minister's statement on 27 November, Jairam Ramesh made it clear in Delhi on the same day that the Congress has not called for a Bharat Bandh
 ravivaar ko hi aam aadmi party ne bhi saaf kar diya ki unki taraf se bharat band kii apil nahin hui he
 However, CPM shut down in Tripura and Kerala
 kolkata main sipiem netaa or paulitte beuro sadsy vimaan bose ne is band kii aalochana kar di he or kaha he ki band kaa aahvaan kar left ne galati kii he
 There is a difference between Bandh and Bharat Bandh
 sawaal he bharat band kii apil kisne kii
 BSP leader Mayawati also made a statement on Monday that the BSP did not appeal for the Bharat Bandh
 samaajawaadee party ke saansad naresh agarwal ne kaha ki mere khyaal se ye ab tak kaa safal band he, kyonki bharat to notebandi ke din se hi band he
 We are not calling any new bandh
 rajya sabha main gulam nabi azaad ne bhi kaha ki pradhanmantri ne galat bayani kii he
 In the Lok Sabha, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge has demanded an apology from the Prime Minister for wrongdoing
 basapa, sapa, aap, trinmul, congress or chah vam dal yani 11 vipakshi dal yahi kehete rahe ki hamane bharat band kii apil hi nahin kii thi to phir pradhanmantri ne bharat band kii baat kahaan se kar di
 The opposition did not get a reply from the PM, but due to the pm's saying Bharat Bandh, the opposition was busy in cleaning the whole day
 bijepi bhi samaj gai ki vipaksh ko band karne kaa sabase acha shabd bharat band he
 However, there was a sit-in demonstration at several places on Monday
 notebandi ko lekar dalon ke kaaryakarta hi sadakon par nazar aae
 Common people did not come in support
 kai jagahon par vyapaar mandalon ne apana poster bhi laga diya ke ve bharat band kaa samarthan nahin karte hai
 whatsapp has been running since Saturday that we do not support the Bharat Bandh
 to kya bharat band kaa naaraa whatsap ke zariye failaayaa gaya or jiske samarthan or virodh kii baaten hone lageen
 If there is no time to read or know the news, then do not make the mistake of accepting the content of whatsapp as news
 har dal ke log iske zariye kuprachaar kar rahe hai
 However, during the note ban, so many rules have been announced that it is difficult to keep track of all
 pehle charchaa hui ki jo log apane khate main dhai lakh se zyada paisa jamaa karenge to 200 percent jurmaana lagegaa
 On November 10, Union Revenue Secretary Dr
 Hasmukh Adhia was asked the question that suppose the department finds that more than one million has been deposited in an account and the amount does not match the declared income of the depositor
 aise main jamakarta par kitna kar or jurmaana lagaaya jayega
 So Adhia Sahib's answer is that such cases would be considered tax evasion
 iskar adhinium kii dhara 270(e) ke hisaab se kar kii raashi vasuuli jaaegi or bhugtey kar ke alaava 200 pratishat kii raashi jurmaana ke rup main vasuuli jaaegi
 This press release is available on the website of the Press Information Bureau
 gajipur kii raily main pradhanmantri ne saaf kar diya tha ki ganga main note bahaane se paap nahin dhul jate hai
 It seemed from these statements that those who will not be able to report their income after December 30 are not in good shape
 unke khilaaf karrwai hogi
 On November 28, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley introduced the Income Tax Amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha
 iske anusaar khud aage aakar apana kaala dhan bataane waalon ko safed karne kaa ek or mauka mila he
 One crore black money will have to pay 30 per cent, ie 30 lakh rupees tax
 das fisadi yani das lakh jurmaana lagegaa
 33% surcharge levied on tax, ie 9
 90 lakh rupee
 That is 49 out of a crore
 90 lakh rupee tex ke cat jaayenge
 Now 50 lakhs left, then 25 lakhs will be found immediately
 25 lakh rupee pradhanmantri garib kalyaan deposit skim main jamaa hoga
 The money will remain with the government for four years without interest
 uske baad 25 lakh kaale dhan vaale ko mil jayega
 That is, if there is one crore black money, then fifty lakh can still be saved from it
 yahi nahin jin logon ne apni aay ghoshit nahin kii or chaape main pakade gaye, hisaab nahin de paae to un par 60 fisadi tex lagegaa
 There will be 25 percent surcharge and 10 percent penalty
 100 rupee main 85 rupaya tex main chalaa jayega
 If you tell yourself, 50 rupees in 100 will be yours
 nahin bataayenge to 100 main 15 rupaya hi aapako milegaa
 That is, in both cases, you can be fifty percent white of black money
 jab sarkaar ne 1 june se 30 sitambar ke bich aghoshit aay ghoshit karne kii ek yojana chalaai hi thi or use antim yojana kaha tha to aisi sthiti main is nae sanshodhan ko kya samajha jaae
 Is Government Giving Black Money Another Chance? Comments june se sitambar kii yojana ko lekar sarkaar ne saaf kar diya tha ki iskar vibhaag is baat kii koi padtaal nahin karegaa ki paisa kahaan se aayaa he
 But they have to pay 45% tax and penalty
 june 2016 ke 'man kii baat' main pradhanmantri ne yah baat kahi thi, "jin logon ke paas aghoshit aay he, unke liye bharat sarkaar ne ek mauka diya he
 We can be free from many types of burden by paying a fine
 maine yah vaada kiya he ki swechha se jo aghoshit aay ke sambandh main sarkaar ko jaankaree degaa to sarkaar kisi prakaar kii jaanch nahin karegi
 Also, i want to tell the countrymen that this is the plan till 30 September
 isko ek aakhri mauka maan lijie
 Take advantage of this system before 30 September and protect yourself from possible problems after 30 September
 " We will talk about the new amendment
 kuch praavdhaan to puraane bhi hai, kuch jode gaye hai
 Why did the government have to make this amendment, when it called the action from 1 June to 30 September as the last chance
 kya notebandi ke dauraan yaa baad main milane vaale aghoshit aay ko puraa zabt nahin kar lenaa chahie
 Is this another chance? jab notebandi chal hi rahi he to is sanshodhan kaa kya matlab he hamen yah bhi samajhnaa hoga ki is sanshodhan main kya sona, property or share bhi aate hai yaa ise ham sirf nagdi note ke sandarbh main hi samaj rahe hai
 After this statement of the Prime Minister, the opposition started asking for proof that who has appealed for the Bharat Bandh
 kya media or soshal media ne apni taraf se 28 november ke alag-alag virodh kaaryakramon ko bharat band kaha
 This is not difficult for BJP to prove
 bijepi 24 november ke tamaam press conference or press relies kaa baarik adhyayan kar sakati he jab 28 november ke kaarykram kaa elaan hua tha
 We have seen many parties, cannot claim them but as much as we have seen, there is no mention of Bharat Bandh in any of them
 24 november ko congress netaa randeep surajevaala ne kaha tha ki congress desh bhar main jan aakrosh diwas manaayegi
 Sitaram Yechury's statement on the 24th itself is that on 28 November, many parties will celebrate the Day of Anger across the country
 24 november ko hi sipiai netaa di raja ne kaha tha ki left dal 24 november se 30 november ke bich haftaa bhar pradarshan karenge
 CPM has a press release on its website which is released on 23 November
 isamen saaf kaha gaya he ki 6 left dalon ne tay kiya he ki ek saptaah kaa virodh pradarshan hoga
 India is not a closed word in the press release
 27 november ko pradhanmantri ke bayaan ke baad usee din dilli main jairam ramesh ne press conference kar saaf kar diya ki congress ne bharat band kaa aahvaan nahin kiya he
 On Sunday itself, the Aam Aadmi Party also made it clear that there was no appeal for Bharat Bandh on their behalf
 vaise tripura or kerala main sipiem ne band kiya
 In Kolkata, CPM leader and politburo member Viman Bose has criticized the bandh and said that the Left has made a mistake by invoking the bandh
 band or bharat band main antar hota he
 The question is who appealed for the shutdown of India
 basapa netaa mayawati ne bhi somvaar ko bayaan diya ki basapa ne bharat band kii apil nahin kii
 Samajwadi Party MP Naresh Agarwal said that i think this is a successful shutdown till now, because India is closed since the day of demonetisation
 ham koi nayaa band nahin bula rahe hai
 Ghulam Nabi Azad also said in the Rajya Sabha that the Prime Minister had made a misrepresentation
 loksabhaa main congress netaa mallikarjun khadge ne pradhanmantri se galatabayani ke liye maafee kii maang kii he
 The BSP, SP, AAP, Trinamool, Congress and six Left parties i
e
 11 opposition parties kept saying that we did not appeal for the Bharat Bandh, then from where did the Prime Minister talk of Bharat Bandh
 vipaksh ko piem se jawaab to nahin mila lekin piem ke bharat band kehane se vipaksh din bhar safai dene main laga rahaa
 BJP also understood that the best word to shut down the opposition is India
 baharhaal somvaar ko kai jagahon par dharna pradarshan hua
 Only the workers of the parties appeared on the streets regarding demonetisation
 aam log samarthan main nahin utre
 In many places trade boards have also put up their posters that they do not support the Bharat Bandh
 whatsap par shanivaar se hi abhiyaan sa chal rahaa tha ki ham bharat band kaa samarthan nahin karte hai
 So, was the slogan of Bharat Bandh spread through whatsapp and whose support and opposition started talking
 samachar padhane kaa yaa pataa karne kaa vakt nahin he to koi baat nahin, whatsap kii saamagree ko hi khabar maanane kii galati na karen
 People of every party are misleading through this
 baharhaal is bich notebandi ke dauraan itane niyamon kii ghoshnaa hui he ki sabakaa hisaab rakhana mushkil he
 It was discussed earlier that people who deposit more than 2
5 lakhs in their account will be fined 200%
 10 november ko kendriya rajasav sachiv doctor hasmukh adhiya se sawaal poocha gaya ki maan lijie vibhaag ko ye pataa chalata he ki kisi khate main das lakh se zyaada kii rakam jamaa kii gai he or rakam jamakarta kii ghoshit aay se mail nahin kha rahi he
 In this case, how much tax and penalty will be imposed on the depositor
 to adhiya sahab kaa jawaab he ki is tarah ke maamalon ko kar chori mana jayega
 As per section 270 (a) of the Income Tax Act, the amount of tax will be recovered and 200 percent amount will be recovered as penalty in addition to the tax paid
 patr soochna karyaalay kii website par ye press release maujuud he
 At the rally in Ghazipur, the Prime Minister made it clear that excluding notes in the Ganges does not wash away sins
 in bayanon se yahi lag rahaa tha ki jo log 30 disambar ke baad apni aamadani kaa hisaab nahin de paayenge unki kair nahin he
 Action will be taken against them
 28 november ko vitt mantri arun jetali ne loksabhaa main iskar sanshodhan bill pesh kiya
 According to this, those who claim themselves to be black have got another opportunity to turn white
 ek karod blike mani par 30 fisadi yani tees lakh rupee tex dene honge
 Ten percent will be fined one million
 33 fisadi sarcharge jo tex par lagata he,yani 9
 90 lakh rupees
 yani ek karod main se 49
 90 lakh rupees tax will be deducted
 ab bachaa 50 lakh to uskaa 25 lakh turant mil jayega
 25 lakh rupees will be deposited in the Prime Minister's Poor Welfare Deposit Scheme
 chaar saal tak bina byaaj ke paisa sarkaar ke paas rahegaa
 After that, 25 lakh people will get black money
 yani ek karod kaala dhan he to usamen se pachaas lakh abhi bhi batch saktaa he
 Not only this, those who did not declare their income and were caught in the raid, if they could not account, then they would be taxed 60 percent
 25 fisadi sarcharge or 10 fisadi jurmaana lagegaa
 85 rupees for 100 rupees will be taxed
 khud bataa denge to 100 main 50 rupaya aapkaa rahegaa
 If you do not tell, you will get 15 rupees in 100
 yani donon hi surat main aap blike mani kaa pachaas fisadi white ho saktaa he
 When the government had started a plan to declare undisclosed income between June 1 and September 30 and called it a final plan, then what should be considered in this situation
 kya sarkaar kaale dhan vaale ko ek or mauka de rahi he?tippaniyan Regarding the plan from June to September, the government had made it clear that the Income Tax Department would not investigate where the money came from
 lekin unhen 45 percent tex or penlti dene honge
 In the June 2016 ‘mann Ki Baat’, the Prime Minister said, “for those who have undisclosed income, the Government of India has given an opportunity
 jurmaana dekar ham anek prakaar ke boj se mukt ho sakate hai
 i have promised that if voluntary who gives information to the government regarding undisclosed income, then the government will not do any kind of investigation

 During this time the Portuguese built important houses, monasteries, churches and orphanages here
 kile ke andar sirf portugali nobel le jane kii ijaajat thi
 Vasai was also a major naval center and shipbuilding center under the Portuguese
 1739 main maratha shaasha peshwa bajirao ke bhai chimaji appa ne kile par chadhaai kar vijay paa lee
 Although he had to lose a lot of people in this
 1802 kii baat he jab peshwa bajirao dwitiya ne vasai kii sandhi kar lee
 After this, the fort and city of Vasai came under the dominion of the British
 aaj kile kii raunak thodi bahut deepawali ke dauraan hi hoti he jab yahaan videshi or anya paryatak pahunchate hai
 This is the time when the fort is cleaned
 lekin aaj puraane ho chuke is kile ke andar kii adhikansh sanrachanaayen khandhar ho chuki hai or jirnoddhar kii baat joh rahi hai

 After winning the third and final Test at the Kingsmead ground in Durban with the help of Master Blaster Sachin Tendulkar's career 51st Test century, India won the five-match ODI series starting on Wednesday on the basis of this veteran batsman's experience
 Will begin with chot ke kaaran virendra sahvaag or gautam gambhir kii salaami jodi ke baahar hone ke baad team india ko tendulkar se kaaphi ummid hogi jinhen kingsmid par saat ekadivasiy match khilne kaa anubhav he
 This ground has also been very successful for Tendulkar and he has done well here with both ball and bat
 bharat ke liye yah maidan haalanki durbhaagyashaalee rahaa he jahaan usne apane saat maichon main se chaar ganvaaye jabaki keval do main hi jeet darj kar sakaa
 Not only this, India's record against South Africa is worse here and they have lost in four of their five matches against the hosts, while one match was inconclusive
 bharat ne is maidan par do jeet england or kenya ke khilaaf darj kii hai
 On the other hand, this field has not been very successful against South Africa, who have generally performed unmatched on home soil, which will make India desperate to register their first win here
 dakshin africa ne ab tak yahaan 27 match khele hai jisamen se usne 14 main jeet darj kii jabaki aath main use shikast kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Four matches of the host team ended inconclusive
 bharat kii jeet kaa daaromadar ballebaaji main tendulkar ke alaava captain mahendra singh dhoni, yuvaraj singh, suresh raina, yuva viraat kohli, rohit sharma, murali vijay or yusuf pathan jaise khilaadiyon par hoga
 Talking of bowling, the Indian bowling attack will be led once again by Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh, while Ashish Nehra, Praveen Kumar, s Sreesanth, r Ashwin and Munaf Patel will also have to play an important role
 jahir or nehra ko is maidan par gendbaaji kaa acha khaasaa anubhav he or donon yahaan safal bhi rahe hai
 Zaheer scored 12 from five matches here
 3 kii bejod ausat ke saath 13 wicket chatkaye hai jabaki nehra ke naam chaar maichon main 10
 Nine wickets are recorded at an average of 77
 tendulkar ne bhi yahaan paanch wicket apane naam kiya hai lekin buudhvaar ke match main unke gendbaaji karne kii sambhaavna kam hi he
 However, Yuvraj Singh and Yusuf Pathan can play the role of a bowler after a good performance in a T20 match
 bhartiya gendbaajon ke liye haalanki dakshin africa ke ballebaaj kram se paar paanaa aasaan nahin hoga jisaki aguai anbhavi jaak kallis or greem smith karte hai
 Kallis has added 709 runs at this ground at an average of over 44 while Smith has 444 runs to his name
 iske alaava abi divilliars, hashim amala or anbhavi mark bouchar bhi kisi bhi team kii pareshaani badha sakate hai
 However, Kallis is doubtful to play in this match due to injury which could be a big setback for the team
 gendbaaji main del sten or morne morkal kii tufaani jodi ke alaava captain johaan botha bhartiya ballebaajon kaa sirdard badhaane ko taiyaar honge
 South African fast bowler Vernon Philander said that Morne Morkel's injury caused a huge loss to his team in the first Test match against India
 morkal ke din ke pehle satr main takhnaa mud jane se chot lag gai or ab vah puure test match se baahar ho gaye hai
 Philander said that losing Morne was very painful
 iske baad hamen pataa chalaa ki del sten, jaikas kallis or mujhe gendbaaji kaa boj saajha karnaa padegaa
 Philander confirmed that Morkel would no longer bowl throughout the match

 If the government and the poll panel cohesively remain in place, Bihar will become the first state to delegate the right to coveting overseas nris
 chunaav ayogis project par kanoon mantralay ke saath milakar kaam kar rahaa he
 So that nris can vote in Legislative Assembly elections through e-postal ballot or proxy
 is aashay kii khabar angreji akhbaar iconomic times ne prakashit kii he
 According to sources, the poll panel is asking the government to amend the Representation of People Act till the monsoon session of Parliament
 taaki bihar chunaav main iskaa test kiya ja sake
 The Election Commission has to set up new assemblies in Bihar before 29 November
 gauratlab he ki bihar main lagbhag 1000 enarai registerd he
 However, the Election Commission has yet to decide whether this pilot project will cover the whole of Bihar or will be limited to only a few legislatures
 ek adhikari ne kaha, 'ek baar act main sanshodhan ho jaae phir is par nirnay liya jayega
 'he said,' Once it is successful, the Election Commission will implement it in other states as well and will be finally implemented in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 'maujuuda paristhitiyon main apravasi bhartiya keval apni vidhansabhaon main vot kar sakate hai
 The obstacle in the way of this regulator is the number of nris, because only a few thousand are registered as voters and live abroad
 inamen se sabase zyada kerala se hai
 The second aspect of this picture is that hardly any NRI comes to India to vote during elections

 It is very sad to say that now many people will be deprived of going to Pakistan at the hands of Giriraj Singh, Shahnawaz Hussain, Yogi Adityanath and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi
 in logon kii travel agency to nahin thi, magar inhone samay samay par virodhiyon ko chunauti dete vakt ye zarur kaha ki pakistan bhej denge yaa chale jaaenge
 Those who wished to send him to Pakistan will now have to go with their money
 prime time main aane vaale in netaaon se mujhe bahut ummid thi ki kabhi na kabhi gussa hokar shahanwaaz bhai yaa giriraaj ji mujhe pakistan zarur bhej denge
 Even after being from Bihar, he did not take care of me
 ab to pakistan or hindustan bhai-bhai hone ja rahe hai to inaki shaayad zarurat bhi na rahe
 After the statement of the Sangh, the leaders of Indian politics should stop the travel agency to send these leaders of Pakistan to Pakistan and get involved in Bihar elections
 bhartiya raajnneeti main jaise ko taisa yani sathe saathyam samacharet paathyakram kaa sabase bada chapter he pakistan
 Pakistan has to learn a lesson, our leaders and some of their ignorant supporters keep on rote it
 chunaav aate hi jor jor se ratane lagate hai
 In the name of Pakistan, many leaders start developing the ability of the foreign minister
 bhartiya raajnneeti main pakistan ek aisi samasya he jise bayanon se do minute main sulajhaa diya jaataa he
 These days, the leaders who have become bored with traitorous words have started the experiment of sending them to Pakistan
 vahaan bhejne ke itane bayaan aane lage ki pakistan bhi ghabara gaya hoga
 In this panic, he also started sending people across the border
 in netaaon ne sirf apane virodhiyon ko pakistan jane kaa paatr samajha
 With the Sangh statement, now BJP supporters will not have any moral crisis in going to Pakistan
 gambhirtha se dekhen to yahi soch sarkaar ko kuch nayaa karne se roak bhi rahi thi
 Whenever the Prime Minister steps in, everyone opens a chapter that teaches Pakistan a lesson and starts cramping it
 dushmani kaa gharelu udyog pakistan ke achche din jane vaale hai
 All confusions were overcome regarding Pakistan
 kabhi padosi, kabhi dushman to kabhi kabhi subah savere kisi nishchit gantavy tak jane kii kriya ko bhi pakistan janaa kehane lagate hai log

 After a three-day successful coordination meeting between the union and the government, RSS co-head Dattatreya Hasbole has said that India also has family and cultural ties with neighboring countries
 nepal, bhutan, srilanka, pakistan yaa bangladesh ho
 Rather, they are two countries, broken by their own bodies
 
 Pakistan and Bangladesh
 to swaabhaavik he yahaan rahane vaale log apane hi parivaar ke hai
 Sometimes in relationships
 
 Like brother gets into brothers also
 aisa kuch dashakon main hue honge
 But forgetting all these, we have cultural relations with neighboring countries
 
 With its history
 
 Those associated with geography
 
 In terms of how they could be better, they also thought about the neighboring country
 patrkaar smita mishra ne poocha bhi ki pakistan kii taraf se pichley kuch samay main tezi se ghatnaayen badhi hai, kya aapako lagata he ki bharat ke liye mumkin he bhai-bhai jaise sambandh sthapit kar paanaa
 So Dattatreya Hasbole said that Kauravas and Pandavas were also brothers in India
 dharm sansthapana ke liye sab karnaa padataa he
 Everything has to be done to establish a religion
 lekin dharm sansthapana ke liye hi to kaurav pandav ke bich yuddh hua tha
 Did Hasbole ji say that something like that happened between the Kaurava Pandavas about religion is going to happen or they are saying that 105 brothers can be the same as before the war of religion
 is bayaan ko sunate hi mujhe hurrian netaa gilaani ji thodi chintaa to hui
 If this statement had a positive effect on him, then what do he know that he should again take the suitcase to the Pakistan Embassy in Chanakyapuri, Delhi and Sartaj Aziz Saheb should also come there
 kya ab ye mulaakaaten bhai bhai ke siddhant ke tahat ho sakati hai
 Due to these meetings, the thing that the Prime Minister had promised in Ufa could not happen
 kya ab upha kii ulfat rang laaegi
 Is there a new different environment being created to make something new and bigger than before
 aakhir aresas ko kyon lag rahaa he ki bhai bhai kaa jhagada tha, civil court vaala, aatankwaad ko lekar jhagada nahin tha, tada court vaala
 Does the Sangh now want to leave the condition of terrorism and give opportunity to other way of culture and relations
 sabak sikhaane vaale chapter kaa kya hoga
 Has she been given a cry vaise sangh ke bhai bhai vaale bayaan se jo bhi baatcheet ke samarthak hai unhen khush hona chahie ki unke saath sangh bhi aa gaya he
 Those who are seated with lessons from the lesson can feel lonely
 bhai bhai kaa jhagada bataakar dattatreya ji ne dephence beet ke phufaaon ko niraash kiya hoga to gharelu jhagada cover karne vaale local beet ke patrakaron ko utsahit
 However, in June this year, a statement from Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat came in Mathura that puraa upmahadweep hi hindu raashtra he
 No one should doubt that those living in India, Bangladesh or Pakistan are part of the Hindu nation
 akhabaaron kii report ke anusaar unhone pakistan or bangladesh ko bhi hindu raashtra kah diya
 He said that his citizenship may be different but the nationality is Hindu
 kya aaj kaa bayaan sangh pramukh ke bayaan kaa vistaar tha yaa koi nayaa mode aayaa he
 Has the Sangh accepted any line of Prime Minister
 ek or mahatvapurn baat hui
 
 
 
 or ye baat thik pradhanmantri kii kaali gadiyon ke is kafile ke aane se pehle kahi gai
 Dattatreya Hasbole said that the model of economy should be based on Indian values rather than western
 sarkaar gaanv waalon kii kamai padhai or dawaai par dhyaan de taaki unka shaharon kii taraf palaayan ruke
 If the Sangh really wants to do this, then it should have told before giving praise to the government, which decision of the economy has been made on the basis of Indian values by rejecting the Western model
 tippaniyan In the era of smart city, does anyone really have such a formula or does the union have it, then will the government really stop migrating on it
 palaayan badhaane ke liye hi to smart city taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he taaki bharat or adhik shahari ho sake
 Are these all good things to hear or will Make in India be lured into this model
 samanvay baithak se donon kaa samanvay kahin puure sangh parivaar ko sandesh to nahin tha ki bihar chunaav main chalakar jute jaaiye
 Government unions are all one

 Dattatreya Hasbole said that the model of economy should be based on Indian values rather than western
 sarkaar gaanv waalon kii kamai padhai or dawaai par dhyaan de taaki unka shaharon kii taraf palaayan ruke
 If the Sangh really wants to do this, then it should have told before giving praise to the government, which decision of the economy has been made on the basis of Indian values by rejecting the Western model
 tippaniyan In the era of smart city, does anyone really have such a formula or does the union have it, then will the government really stop migrating on it

 Government unions are all one
 pakistan hindustan bhai bhai hai
 Who are those who were fighting with these brothers
 wo ab kahaan jaaenge
 They should watch prime time
 dushmani kaa gharelu udyog pakistan ke achche din jane vaale hai
 All confusions were overcome regarding Pakistan
 kabhi padosi, kabhi dushman to kabhi kabhi subah savere kisi nishchit gantavy tak jane kii kriya ko bhi pakistan janaa kehane lagate hai log
 Now such people open their ears and listen
 pakistan ko sabake sikhaane ke sabase bade skool se aadesh aayaa he ki ham sab bhai bandhu hai
 After a three-day successful coordination meeting between the union and the government, RSS co-head Dattatreya Hasbole has said that India also has family and cultural ties with neighboring countries
 nepal, bhutan, srilanka, pakistan yaa bangladesh ho
 Rather, they are two countries, broken by their own bodies
 
 Pakistan and Bangladesh
 to swaabhaavik he yahaan rahane vaale log apane hi parivaar ke hai
 Sometimes in relationships
 
 Like brother gets into brothers also
 aisa kuch dashakon main hue honge
 But forgetting all these, we have cultural relations with neighboring countries
 
 With its history
 
 Those associated with geography
 
 In terms of how they could be better, they also thought about the neighboring country
 patrkaar smita mishra ne poocha bhi ki pakistan kii taraf se pichley kuch samay main tezi se ghatnaayen badhi hai, kya aapako lagata he ki bharat ke liye mumkin he bhai-bhai jaise sambandh sthapit kar paanaa
 So Dattatreya Hasbole said that Kauravas and Pandavas were also brothers in India
 dharm sansthapana ke liye sab karnaa padataa he
 Everything has to be done to establish a religion
 lekin dharm sansthapana ke liye hi to kaurav pandav ke bich yuddh hua tha
 Did Hasbole ji say that something like that happened between the Kaurava Pandavas about religion is going to happen or they are saying that 105 brothers can be the same as before the war of religion
 is bayaan ko sunate hi mujhe hurrian netaa gilaani ji thodi chintaa to hui
 If this statement had a positive effect on him, then what do he know that he should again take the suitcase to the Pakistan Embassy in Chanakyapuri, Delhi and Sartaj Aziz Saheb should also come there
 kya ab ye mulaakaaten bhai bhai ke siddhant ke tahat ho sakati hai

 Is there a new different environment being created to make something new and bigger than before

 Does the Sangh now want to leave the condition of terrorism and give opportunity to other way of culture and relations
 sabak sikhaane vaale chapter kaa kya hoga
 Has she been given a cry vaise sangh ke bhai bhai vaale bayaan se jo bhi baatcheet ke samarthak hai unhen khush hona chahie ki unke saath sangh bhi aa gaya he
 Those who are seated with lessons from the lesson can feel lonely
 bhai bhai kaa jhagada bataakar dattatreya ji ne dephence beet ke phufaaon ko niraash kiya hoga to gharelu jhagada cover karne vaale local beet ke patrakaron ko utsahit

 Government unions are all one
 pakistan hindustan bhai bhai hai
 Who are those who were fighting with these brothers
 wo ab kahaan jaaenge
 They should watch prime time
 sangh or sarkaar ke bich chali teen dinon kii safal samanvay baithak ke baad aresas ke sah sar kaarywah dattatreya hasbhole ne kaha he ki bharat ke padosi deshon ke saath paariwarik or saanskrithik sambandh bhi hai
 Be it Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Pakistan or Bangladesh
 balki apane sharir se hi tuutakar wo bane hue hai do desh to
 
 pakistan or bangladesh
 So it is natural that the people living here belong to their own family
 kabhi-kabhi sambandhon main
 
 jaise bhai bhaiyon main bhi ho jaataa he
 This must have happened in a few decades
 lekin in sab ko bhuulakar ham padosi deshon ke saath saanskrithik sambandh
 
 apane itihaas ke saath
 
 bhugol ke saath jo jude hue hai
 
 wo or achche kaise ho sakate hai, is drushti se bhi thodaa padosi desh ke bare main vichaar kiya
 Journalist Smita Mishra also asked that there has been a rapid increase in the past few times from Pakistan, do you think it is possible for India to establish a brother-brother relationship
 to dattatreya hasbhole ne kaha ki bharat main kaurav or pandav bhi bhai bhai the
 Everything has to be done to establish a religion
 dharm sthapana ke liye sab karnaa padataa he
 But for the establishment of religion, there was a war between the Kaurava Pandavas
 kya hasbhole ji ne yah kah diya ki dharm ko lekar jo kaurav pandavon ke bich hua vaisaa kuch hone vaala he yaa ve ye kah rahe hai ki dharm yuddh se pehle kii tarah 105 bhai ek ho sakate hai
 Hearing this statement, i was a bit worried by Hurrian leader Gilani ji
 agar un par is bayaan kaa sakaaratmak asar ho gaya to kya pataa ve phir se suutakes lekar dilli ke chanakyapuri sthit pakistan duutavas aa jaye, udhar se sartaaj azeez sahab bhi aa jaaen
 Can these meetings now take place under the principle of Bhai Bhai? inhen mulakaaton ke chalate to wo baat na ho saki jiskaa vaada upha main pradhanmantri kar aae the
 Will Ufa's color bring color now? kya kuch nayaa or pehle se bada karne ke liye kuch nayaa alag maahaul banaaya ja rahaa he
 After all, why does the RSS feel that there was a fight between Bhai Bhai, civil court, there was no fight over terrorism, Tada court one
 kya sangh ab aatankwaad kii shart se nikal kar samskruti or sambandhon ke dusron raste ko mauka dena chahta he
 What will happen to the chapter that teaches the lesson? kya uski tilanjali de di gai he
 By the way, the supporters of the conversation who are supporters of the Sangh's brother should be happy that the Sangh has also come with them
 jo sabak sikhaane vaale chapter liye baithe hai wo lonly feel kar sakate hai
 Dattatreya ji may have disappointed the defense beat puffs by telling Bhai Bhai's quarrel, while encouraging local beat journalists who covered the domestic fight
 vaise isi saal june main mathura main sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat kaa ek bayaan aayaa tha ki The entire subcontinent is a Hindu nation
 kisi ko shaq nahin hona chahie ki bharat bangladesh yaa pakistan me jo bhi rah rahe hai wo hindu raashtra kaa hissaa hai
 According to newspaper reports, they also called Pakistan and Bangladesh as Hindu nations
 unhone kaha ki unki naagarikta alag ho sakati he magar rashtriyata hindu he
 Was today's statement an extension of the Sangh chief's statement or has there been a new twist
 kya sangh ne pradhanmantri kii kisi line ko sweekaar kiya he
 Another important thing happened
 
 
 
 And this was said right before the arrival of this convoy of black trains of the Prime Minister
 dattatreya hasbhole ne kaha ki arthvyavastha kaa model pashchimi na hokar bhartiya mulyon par bane
 The government should pay attention to the education and medicine of the villagers so that their migration to the cities is stopped
 agar sangh vaaki aisa chahta he to use sarkaar ko shaabaashi dene se pehle bataanaa chahie tha ki arthvyavastha kaa koun sa faisla pashchimi model ko nakaar kar bhartiya mulyon ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 The comments smart city ke daur main kya kisi ke paas sachmuch aisa formula he yaa sangh ke paas he to kya sarkaar vaaki us par chalakar palaayan roak degi
 To increase migration, a smart city is being prepared so that India can become more urban
 kya ye sab kehane sunne ke liye acchhee baaten hai yaa mek in india ko is model main feet kar bahala phuslaa diya jayega
 The coordination of the two from the coordination meeting was not a message to the entire Sangh Parivar that they should get together in Bihar elections
 sarkaar sangh sab ek hai
 Pakistan Hindustan is brother

 Where will they go now? unhen prime time dekhnaa chahie

 The troubled Pune-based Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) chairman and actor Gajendra Chauhan is now finding support from his TV peers
 tivi ke lokapriy dharawahik 'mahabharat' ke kalakaar ab gajendra chouhan urf 'yudhisthir' ke paksh main saamne aa gaye hai
 Actually, students and other members of the institution are strongly opposing the FTII chairmanship of Gajendra Chauhan
 lekin is maamle main 'mahabharat' main 'duryodhana' kii bhoomika nibhaane vaale abhinayta punit issar ne gajendra chouhan kaa saath dete hue enditivi se baatcheet main kaha ki unke tivi ke chachere bhai ke saath anyaay ho rahaa he
 Puneet says, "sadly, this case is going from bad to worse
 
 
 gajendra ko mauka die bagaiyr hi unki kaabiliyat par kaise sawaal uthaa sakate hai
 
 
 The What is the guarantee that a more 'big name' will be able to run FTII better
 
 
 ?" In this case, not only 'duryodhana', in the 'mahabharata', his 'elder elder brother Karna', that is, actor Pankaj Dheer also seems to say something similar
 pankaj ke mutabik, "agar sarkaar ne gajendra ko yah kaam saunpa he to usamen kuch to baat rahi hogi
 
 
 Anyway, the job of FTII chairman is not to teach but to run the organization, so this post has nothing to do with Chauhan's acting career
 
 
 " Pankaj Dhir also said that many students, after studying with the average teacher, sometimes make something big
 vaise bhi kaaphi badi hastiyaan apatiai ke chairman kii kursi par baithi, lekin ve apni jimmedaariyaan achche se nahin nibhaa pain
 Apart from these two, Goofy Pental, who played 'shakuni', one of the 'main villains' of 'mahabharata', said, "it is true that Gajendra does not have that much merit compared to former FTII presidents, but if If the government had to seat a man of its own, then this post could also be given to Shatrughan Sinha or Hema Malini
 
 
 haalanki mujhe nahin lagata ki chaatro kaa is tarah virodh karnaa sahi he
 
 
 Gajendra should get a chance to prove himself once
 
 
 " Amidst all this, 'bhishma Pitamah' of 'mahabharata', that is, actor Mukesh Khanna, spoke very openly
 mukesh ne kadaa rukh apanaate hue kaha ki yah faisla sarkaar leti he or chaatro ko apni sharten rakhane kaa koi haq nahin
 If Gajendra feels that he deserves this, then he should be given a chance
 agar chaatro ko samasya he to ve apatiai se chale jaaen, chaatro kii soch galat he
 The comments gauratlab he ki mukesh khanna pichley 15 saal se bhartiya janata party ke liye chunaav prachaar karte aa rahe hai or haal hi main unhen children film sosayadi kaa adhyaksh niyukt kiya gaya he
 At the same time, Roopa Ganguly, known as 'draupadi', has also held the students responsible for this whole incident
 unhone bhi ek baar gajendra ko mauka die jane kii baat doharaai
 In West Bengal, BJP member Roopa Ganguly believes that it is wrong to humiliate someone like this
 bhale hi gajendra kaa kariyar bahut yaadgaar na rahaa ho, lekin isamen shaayad unki kismat kaa dosha zyada tha
 Anyway, where do everyone in the industry get opportunities according to his ability

 is maamle main sirf 'duryodhana' hi nahin, 'mahabharat' main unke 'sautele bade bhai karn', yani abhinayta pankaj dheer bhi aisa hi kuch kehete nazar aate hai
 According to Pankaj, "if the government has assigned this task to Gajendra, then there must have been something in it
" 
 
 vaise bhi apatiai chairman kaa kaam padhaane kaa nahin, sanstha chalaane kaa he, isliye is post kaa chouhan ke acting kariyar se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 
 
 " pankaj dheer ne yah bhi kaha ki kai baar ausat teacher se padhakar bhi kai chaatr kuch bada kar jate hai
 Anyway, a lot of big personalities sat on the chair of FTII chairman, but they could not fulfill their responsibilities well
 in donon ke alaava 'mahabharat' ke 'mukhya khalnaayakon' main se ek 'shakuni' kii bhoomika adaa karne vaale gufi paintal ne kaha, "yah sach he ki apatiai ke purv adhyakshon kii tulana main gajendra ke paas utani yogyata nahin he, lekin agar sarkaar ko apane hi kisi aadmi ko bithaana tha to shatrughna sinha yaa hema malini ko bhi yah pad diya ja saktaa tha
 
 
 However i do not think it is right to oppose the students in this way
 
 
 gajendra ko khud ko sabit karne kaa mauka to ek baar milanaa chahie
 
 
 " in sabake bich 'mahabharat' ke 'bhishma pitamah', yani abhinayta mukesh khanna ne kaaphi khulkar apni baat saamne rakhi
 Mukesh took a strong stand and said that the government takes this decision and the students have no right to keep their conditions
 agar gajendra ko lagata he ki vah is laayak hai to unhen mauka diya janaa chahie
 If the students have problems then they should leave FTII, the thinking of the students is wrong
 tippaniyan It is worth noting that Mukesh Khanna has been campaigning for the Bharatiya Janata Party for the last 15 years and recently he has been appointed as the President of Children's Film Society
 vahiin 'draupadi' ke naam se pahachaani jane vaali roopa ganguli ne bhi is puure ghatnakram ke liye chaatro ko hi jimmedaar tehraaya he
 He also reiterated that once Gajendra was given a chance
 pashchim bengal main bhaajapa kii sadsy roopa ganguli maanati hai ki kisi ko is tarah apamaanit karnaa galat he
 Even though Gajendra's career has not been very memorable, but perhaps his luck was more to blame in this
 vaise bhi industry main har kisi ko uski kaabiliyat ke hisaab se maukey kahaan mil pate hai
 Pankaj Dhir also said that many students, after studying with the average teacher, sometimes make something big

 bhartiya janata party kii ore se pradhanmantri narendra modi ne shuukravaar ko jagadalpur main raily ko sambodhit kiya
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi started his speech in Chhattisgarhi language
 PM ne kaha ki bhaidooj ke tyohaar ke din main aapse kuch maangane aayaa hum
 So far, i have come to Bastar alone more times than all the Prime Ministers have been in the country
 jab bhi aayaa hum khaali haath nahin aayaa hum
 PM Modi said that the business of earlier governments was yours, i have come today to fulfill my responsibility
 jimmedaari ke tahat yahaan ke logon kii kathinaaiyon ko dur karnaa he
 The Prime Minister said that the earlier governments remained entangled in my game, but our aim is development of all
 chhattisgarh kaa vikaas dekh logon ko aashcharya hota he
 'congress speaks in support of urban Naxalites' The Prime Minister said that earlier governments used to say that there is no development here due to Naxalites
 lekin hamaari sarkaar ne sabhi mushkilon kaa saamana kar vikaas kiya
 Urban Maoists who live in AC in cities and their children study abroad, but sitting there, tribal people work to ruin their lives
 congress party urban maovadiyon ke paksh main khadi hoti he, naksalwad ko mudda banaakar congress voton kii kheti kar rahi he
 'no one else can come to Bastar' The Prime Minister said that a lotus should bloom on every seat in Bastar, if anyone else comes, they will stain the dreams of Bastar
 hamen atal ji ke sapanom ko puraa karnaa he, isliye ham baar-baar chhattisgarh main aae hai
 Chhattisgarh is now 18 years old, so we are fulfilling its dreams

 'UPA government used to stop development of Chhattisgarh' When Chhattisgarh was formed, Congress government was formed in the beginning, they did wrong with it in the beginning

 The BJP government has shed blood and sweat for the development of Chhattisgarh for 15 years

 The government of Delhi wanted to stop all the work of Chhattisgarh
 '2014 ke baad mila vikaas kaa dabl ingine'piem modi bole ki 2014 ke baad se chhattisgarh ke vikaas ko dabl ingine mila, ek dilli kaa ingine or raipur kaa ingine
 Our government blocked 9000 villages of Chhattisgarh by roads, a new network of national highway has been made in the state
 congress hameshaa dalit-peediton ko votbank ke rup main dekhati he, kabhi insaan ke rup main nahin dekhati he
 Atal ji's government created a separate ministry for the tribals for the first time
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki congress party adivaasiyon kii veshbhusha, unke rahane-sahane kaa majaak udaati he
 When the tribals wore a turban on me, the Congress made fun of it
 tabhi se purvottar ke adivasee congress se naaraaz hai, ab congress vaale aisa kuch bolne kii himmat nahin karte
 At one point of time, the Congress had roasted the tribals with bullets
 patrkaar kii hatya kii nindapradhanmantri bole ki naksaliyon ne ek patrkaar ko maar diya, wo to sirf yahaan apana kaam karne aayaa tha
 But the Congress party calls these Naxalites revolutionary, who killed the innocent, they are looking revolutionary

 The discussion of an alliance between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress has come to a new turn
 ek taraf jahaan ummidavaaron ke namakan kaa samay nazadik aa rahaa he, to vahiin donon raajnneetik dal gathbandhan ko lekar koi thos faisla nahin le paa rahe hai
 Recently closed doors for discussion of coalition, Aam Aadmi Party and Congress have reopened with their own terms
 shanivaar ko aam aadmi party sarkaar main dipti siem manish sisodiya ne pehali baar congress se gathbandhan ko lekar party mukhyalay main press conference kii
 Attacking the Congress, Sisodia said that the Congress was adopting slackness on the coalition
 congress ek chote se mudde par koi nirnay nahin le paa rahi he jiske kaaran 1 maheene kaa behad keemtee samay kharaab ho chukaa he
 Enumerating the reason for the alliance with the Congress, Manish Sisodia said that the Congress has started talks with senior leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party again for the last one week
 aam aadmi party ne congress ke saamne bhaajapa ko 33 loksabhaa siton par rokane kaa prastaav rakhaa he
 Of these 33 seats, 7 seats are from Delhi, 10 seats from Haryana, 13 seats from Punjab, 1 seat from Chandigarh and 2 seats from Goa
 vartmaan main in 35 siton main se 23 siton par bhaajapa ke saansad hai
 Sisodia said that if the Congress had considered this proposal, then the BJP would have directly lost 23 seats compared to 2014
 gathbandhan par congress kii manshaa par sawaal khadey karte hue manish sisodiya ne kaha ki congress ne jaanboojhkar koi bhi nirnay lene main deree kii he
 It is not that the Congress could not take a decision on this, but different things were said deliberately by one leader or sometimes by another leader
 haalanki bayaanbazi ke is dilachasp jhagade kii shruwaat shuukravaar ko hui jab gathbandhan ke liye aam aadmi party se baatcheet karne vaale congress netaa pisi chaako ne kaha ki aam aadmi party haryana or punjab main bhi siton par baatcheet karnaa chaahati thi jis vajah se dilli main 7 siton par sahmati nahin ban pai
 The formula of Congress in Delhi was 4-3, i
e
, 4 seats Aam Aadmi Party and Congress on 3 seats
 pisi chaako ne kaha ki yadi aam aadmi party sirf dilli main gathbandhan chaahati he to aaj bhi congress baatcheet ko taiyaar he
 Reversing the proposal of Congress leader PC Chacko, Manish Sisodia on Saturday said that "on our proposal, the Congress said that only 7 seats in Delhi will combine
" kya aisa karke congress baaki kii 26 siton par bhaajapa ko jitaana chaahati he? dilli main aam aadmi party kii purna bahumat kii sarkaar he, or dilli main aam aadmi party apane bal par hi saaton siten jeet sakati he, lekin keval dilli kii siten jeetna hi aam aadmi party kaa lakshya nahin he
 Now it is for the Congress to decide whether their priority at this time is to defeat the modi-shah duo or set a record of contesting more seats
 philhal manish sisodiya ne congress ke saamne ek nayaa prastaav rakhaa he
 Number Isodia has passed said Time Goa, so it is useless to talk to him, and, according to the Congress in both parties, a party in Punjab and other opposition understand once you do not combine it But what is the reason for alliance in Haryana and Chandigarh? If the Congress wants, there is still time, the modi-shah duo can be defeated in 18 seats
 agar congress dilli ke saath-saath haryana or chandigarh main bhi gathbandhan karne ke liye taiyaar he to aam aadmi party bhi gathbandhan ke liye taiyaar he
 Nomination time is also one of the reasons why the alliance between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress is intensifying, which is slowly coming to a close
 jaankaree ke mutabik 12 may ko hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav ke liye 16 april ko notification jari hoga
 That is, from this day, the candidates willing to contest elections will be able to enroll
 jabaki namakan daakhil karne kii aakhri taarikh 23 april hogi
 After this, the Election Office will check the nomination papers on 24, then the name can be withdrawn by 26 April
 aapako bataa den ki dilli kii saat siton par loksabhaa chunaav hone hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party has fielded candidates for all Lok Sabha seats but the Congress and BJP have not yet announced the candidates

 Given the MFN States, other countries remain confident that they will not be harmed in trade
 bharat ne pakistan ko 1996 main menen kaa darja diya tha
 Because of this, Pakistan gets higher import quotas and lower trade tariffs
 haalanki, badale main pakistan ne aashwaasan dene ke baavjood bharat ko ab tak menen darja nahin diya he

 com / kosrnbdgoj desh kii sabase puraani party congress badlaav ke liye abhi bhi taiyaar nahin dikhti
 Due to the severe defeat of the party in the Lok Sabha elections, it was felt that it will change itself according to the time
 lekin nahin
 Still there does not appear to be something new, revolutionary or unprecedented
 party mahasamudr main bhatki nauka sa vyavhaar kar rahi he
 He has no idea where to go
 itani badi haar ke baad logon ko lagata tha ki party ek nae sire se apane ko taiyaar karegi
 But there is so much decision in the party that it is not thinking anything
 congress ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi hai ki party kaa bhaar uthaane main koi khaas dilchaspee nahin rakhte
 He was not ready to become the leader of the party in the Lok Sabha, so Mallikarjun Kharge was made the leader
 khadge bhale hi ek kushal saansad or sulajhe hue netaa hon lekin party main unase behatar or tejatarraar netaaon kii kami nahin he
 But it seems that Sonia Gandhi's advisors have chosen this name
 yahaan par ek shabd sonia gandhi ke salaahkaaron ke bare main bhi kahana jaruri he
 These advisors are a handful of people working behind the scenes
 ye jamini netaa nahin hai or unka vot kii raajnneeti se kabhi vaasta bhi nahin rahaa
 The opinion given by such people to Sonia Gandhi, it can be easily guessed
 jahaan tak rahul gandhi kii baat he to vah party main sakriy netaa kii bhoomika nibhaane main zyada ruchi nahin rakhte hai or aise main unhone bhi is pasandgi par chuppi saadhe rakhi
 a better party would elect a leader in the Lok Sabha in a democratic way
 lekin aisa karnaa congress kii parampara nahin he
 This party runs on the decree issued from closed rooms and hence is unable to find any solution to this catastrophe
 vahaan paraajay ke baad party kaa punargathan karne kii kisi ko koi jaldi nahin he
 a revolt is brewing in the party
 nai vichaardhaara or puraani soch ke bich ek takaraav saaf dikhaai de rahaa he
 But there is no visible initiative from the party high command
 aisa lagata he ki upie sarkaar kii hi tarah congress bhi policy paralisis kaa shikaar ho gai he
 The most interesting thing is that the party is not even making any effort to get rid of dynasty, although many important leaders are giving such signs
 ve chaahate hai ki party is ore soche or apni jaden majboot kare taaki aane vaale samay main vah apane boote chunaav lard sake
 People or institutions who are unable to read the writing on the wall have a bleak future
 yahi haal congress kaa he kyonki gandhi parivaar main ab karishmai vyaktitv vaala koi sadsy nahin he or na hi moulik vichaaron vaala raajnneetijna
 Obviously, this party will be able to get up from the thinking and hard work of its members

 vastav main koi bhi nahin jaanata ki digvijay singh kaa iraadaa kya he
 Accompanied by wife Amrita and some 90 others, the Congress general secretary set out for a six-month Narmada Parikrama on September 30, on a 3,300-kilometer walk that would circle the river route in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat
 lekin kya yah 'aadhyatmik khoj' he, jiskaa ve daawa karte hai? yaa phir swayan ko or congress ko apane griharajya main punah sthapit karne kii ek vyapak rajnatik yojana he?chaahe jo ho, raja (jaisaa ki digvijay ko aamtaur par madhya pradesh main pukaara jaataa he) ne bhaajapa or congress donon main apane pratidwandviyon kii peshaani par bal daal die hai

" mujhe hameshaa ek netaa ke taur par jarurat se zyada or ek vyakti ke rup main kam aanka jaataa he
 Digvijay also scolded supporters and party workers who joined the convoy during the yatra, shouting slogans for him and the Congress
 unhone rajnatik tippanee karne se bhi parhez kiya
 His 'discovery' has heavy Hindu religious symbolism, with frequent aarti, a surfeit display of saffron, and even a mobile temple, with frequent worship
 parikrama gaanv se gaanv hote guzarati he, jisamen 'narmade har! ' ke naare ke saath logon kaa abhivadan kiya jaataa he
 Analysts say this pilgrimage at the lowest level will help Digvijay remove the 'anti-hindu' label that he has achieved in previous years
 ve kehete hai, ''main nitant dharmik vyakti hum, lekin meraa dharm mujhe anya sabhi dharmon kaa sakvamaan karne ke liye kahata he

 He says, "I can't close my eyes and ears
" ''vishesh baat yah he ki kuch maheene pehle mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kii namaami devi narmade yatra isi maarg se gujri thi
 The slogans for that trip painted on the village walls have still not faded
 maarg par ek gaanv konderwada ke congress kaaryakarta rajesh patel kehete hai, ''log helicopter se hui ek sarkari yatra or aam aadmi kii tarah chalate raja ke najaare main tulana kar rahe hai
 "on the afternoon of October 11, Digvijay had a brief rest in Nasirabad, from where the ancestral village of Narmadapar CM Chauhan is Jait

 Children's third question to Narendra Modi was, did you think in childhood, will become Prime Minister, will be world famous
 
 
 pradhanmantri ne jawaab diya, kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki piem banuunga, main to class main kabhi monitor bhi nahin ban paaya
 We should not dream of becoming anything in life, we should dream of doing something, because by the time we have become something, we have not become anything
 kuch karne kaa anand apane aap main bahut sukh detaa he

 No teacher discriminates against children

 iske baad nepal ne 134 dinon kii aarthik nakaabandi kaa saamana kiya, jisase nepal main aavashyak vastuon kii baari kami ho gai thi
 Nepal suffered a terrible earthquake tragedy in the month of April that year
 vah usase ubar bhi nahin paaya tha ki is nakaabandi ne halaat or bigaad die
 The Nepalese public considered it to be the 'interference' of India and anti-india sentiments intensified
 china kaa card khelkar bharat se zyada se zyada phayda ugaahne ko bekaraar ke
 P
 sharma oli or anya netaaon ne nepal main rashtravaadi unmaad ko hawa dena shuru kiya or nepal ne bharat par puri tarah nirbharta ko samaapt karne ke liye china kii taraf haath badhaayaa
 China immediately seized this opportunity
 us samay maovadiyon ke saath gathbandhan kii sarkaar chalaa rahe oli ne china ke saath bilkul waisi hi ek vyapaar or pargaman sandhi kii, jaisi sandhi nepal kii bharat ke saath he
 a few days later Ollie's government collapsed
 andeh jataayaa gaya ki yah bharat kii madad se hua he
 This gave further air to the anti-india wave in Nepal
 nepal main phir se chunaav hue or vampanthi yumail / maovadi gathbandhan ne sansad main teen-chauthai bahumat hasil kiya or nae sangheey dhaanche ke tahat gathit saat main se chah praanton main sarkaar bana lee
 It was a big shock for India
 so, asaamaanya pahal karte hue bharat ne videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ko kathmandu bhejkar oli ke netritv main nepal kii sarkaar ke prati bharat kii sadichha prakat kii
 However, Olli was not even sworn in as the new Prime Minister by then
 oli kii haalia bharat yatra par sabaki nigahen jami hui thim
 Foreign policy experts were eyeing and trying to understand how much distrust arose on both sides of the india-nepal relationship in recent years
 yah daura bahut sahaj rahaa or iskaa shrey oli or pradhanmantri narendra modi, donon ko jaataa he
 Both sides emphasized the need to further strengthen this in view of the vast possibilities of mutual cooperation, rather than scouring misunderstandings of the past
 bharat ne ghoshnaa kii ki vah bihar ke raksol ko nepal ke kathmandu tak rail network se jodne or bihar tathaa nepal ko jalmaarg se jodne ke liye aarthik sahaayta muhaiyaa karaayega
 This was the masterstroke to change the psyche of Nepal
 krishi ke kshetra main bhi sahyog badhaane ke liye donon deshon ne mahatvapurn samjhaute par hastakshar kiye
 Unconvincing issues such as the Constitution amendment to include the Madheshis in the 1950 treaty and Nepal's support for China's Belt and Road (BRI) were not discussed in the visit
 oli apane pehle ke nazariye se ulat, is baar bharat ke saath vrihatt aarthik sambandh banane kii baat karte najar aae
 The motto of india-nepal relations has been based on security till now but now both countries will pursue mutual relations with the mantra of development
 bharat ke vyapaarik gharaanon se baatcheet ke dauraan unhone hydropavar, paryaton, krishi, esemai or niryaat aadhaarit udyogon ke kshetra main nivesh kaa nimantran diya or bhartiya niveshkon ke liye anukool vaataavaran taiyaar karne kii disha main har prakaar ke sahyog kaa bharosa diya
 During his visit to India, Oli was seen to be very comfortable in favoring Nepal's relations with China
 unhone kaha ki china ke saath nepal ke sambandhon main ai pragadhata se bhartiya hiton ko koi thes nahin pahonchegi
 Oli is also expected to visit China soon
 china yatra main kuch na kuch aisi nai ghoshnaaen jarur hongi jinase nai dilli ke kaan phir se khadey ho jaaen
 If nothing unexpected happens in the future, Oli will remain Prime Minister of Nepal for the next few years and Nepal will enjoy political stability after a long gap
 oli kii chhavi nepal main bharat-virdohi or china ke prati jhukaav vaali bani he
 India hopes that the political prudence Oli has demonstrated during his visit to Delhi will continue even further and that India will be able to curb China's growing influence in Nepal to some extent

 The figures that have come out of the Lok Sabha election results are shocking
 iske anusaar dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal khud apni seat haar gaye hai or tisare number par hai
 In the New Delhi Assembly, where Kejriwal defeated Sheila Dixit in 2015, this time himself is behind the Congress
 yahanmein congress ko is loksabhaa chunaav ke mutabik 26 hajaar 312 vot mili hai to aam aadmi party ko 14 hajaar 740 vot mili hai
 Not only this, Kailash Gehlot, a minister in the Kejriwal government from Najafgarh, is also at number three, here the Congress will get 23 thousand 354 votes according to the Lok Sabha votes and 22 thousand 302 votes to AAP
 yadi in aakandon ke aadhaar par vidhansabha ke kshetravaar siton se milan kiya jaae to dilli kii 70 siton main se bijepi 65 seat jeet sakati or congress 5 siten jabaki aam aadmi party kaa khaataa bhi nahin khulata dikh rahaa he
 According to the data obtained after the Lok Sabha elections, where BJP is ahead in 65 seats, it is in second place on 5 seats, while Congress is winning 5 seats and is in second place on 42 seats and third in 23 seats
 aam aadmi party ek bhi seat nahin jeet rahi he jabaki 23 siton par vah duusare number par he or 47 siton par tisare number par
 56 as per existing figures to BJP
 5 fisadi vot mili hai jo 2014 ke mukaable takreeban 10 fisadi zyada he
 And it is 24 and a half percent higher than the 2015 assembly
 jabaki congress ko 22
 5 percent of the votes have been received, 7 compared to 2014
 5 fisadi adhik he or 2015 ke vidhansabha ke mukaable saade 12 fisadi adhik 
 On the other hand, if we look at the figures of the Aam Aadmi Party, it has got only 18 per cent votes in this Lok Sabha election, which is 14 and a half less than the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 jabaki 2015 ke vidhansabha ke mukaable saade 31 fisadi vot ghat gaye hai
 That is, the soup of Aam Aadmi Party is clean
 ab aam aadmi party ko aatmamanthan karne kii jarurat he ki party ko kaise bachaaya jaae kyonki uske paas rajya sabha main teen or loksabhaa main sirf ek saansad he
 However, it is being argued here that the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections are fought on different issues and this act has been done by the Aam Aadmi Party in 2015 when AAP, which did not win a single Lok Sabha seat in 2014, has 67 The seats were won and she is confident of doing things like rejuvenating her Mohalla clinics and government schools
 magar maujuuda loksabhaa chunaav ke aankaden bhi kaaphi kuch ishaara kar rahe hai
 You will remember Kejriwal's statement during the election in which he said that Muslims are not voting for Congress and Hindus are also not going to vote but statistics have proved it wrong
 muslim bahul ilaakon jaise silampur, babarpur, mustafabad, ballimaran, matiamhal ,chandani chowk aurokhla jaise vidhansabha main congress number do kii party he or aap number teen par he
 That is, the crisis is too deep for the Aam Aadmi Party, it is a matter of relief that you have time for a few months so that it can improve its condition, otherwise the way the Aam Aadmi Party emerged slowly, it will end as Punjab and He has no future in Goa and neither in Haryana nor AAP wants Kejriwal to let anyone else emerge as a leader
