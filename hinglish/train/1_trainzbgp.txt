 Not only this, the government alleges that Maggi removed many variants without permission
 saath hi FSSAI ne ye bhi kaha ki megi oats masala noodles ko bina manjuuri ke bazaar main utaara gaya or ise bhi bazaar se hataane ko kaha gaya he
 FSSAI states that Nestle has ignored the standards regarding MSG and has asked the company to report on the order in three days

 On the other hand, on Friday, Paul Bulke, the global CEO of Nestlé, the biggest executive of Nestle-making company, came out and claimed that there is nothing wrong in Maggi - he is completely safe from health
 company ne kaha ki usne megi ke 1000 se zyaada namoonon kii jaanch kii gai or har jaanch par megi khari utari
 But there is confusion about Maggi, so we are removing it from the market
 company ne daawa kiya ki megi jald bazaar main waapas lautegi

 There will be a discussion on the worship of Sai Baba in the meeting
 bataaya ja rahaa he is baithak main sai baba kii puja ke samarthan main bayaan dene vaali jal sansaadhan mantri uma bharti ke khilaaf ninda prastaav paarit kiya ja saktaa he
 The issue of Ganga will also be discussed in this meeting
 isse pehle sai baba kii puja ko sahi bataane par shanivaar ko shankaracharya swami swaroopanand kendriya mantri uma bharti par jamkar barase
 Shankaracharya said that Uma Bharti is doing politics of pressure by supporting Sai's worship
 swami swaroopanand ne kaha he ki uma bharti ram bhakt nahin hai
 She worships Sai
 uma ne apni bhakthi kaa swaroop bigaad liya he
 Ram God is angry with him
 sai bhakthi uma bharti kii asafalataa kii vajah he
 He said that Uma is the minister, not God
 unhen janata ne shashan karne ke liye chunaa he or wo dharmik vyavasthaaon main dakhal naa den
 Earlier, Uma Bharti had supported Sai Puja in Haridwar, saying that he himself is a Sai devotee and if his devotees consider Sai as God then what is wrong
 vahiin uma bharti ne kaha he ki vah sant parampara main yakeen rakhti hai or is vivaad ko aage badhaane ke paksh main nahin hai
 Now Shankaracharya has shifted to this statement of the Union Minister of Water Resources
 unhone uma bharti kii guru bhakthi ko hi sawaalon ke ghere main khadaa karte hue kaha ki jin guru swami vishvesh tirth se sanyas kii diksha lee hai, vah sai puja kaa virodh kar rahen hai
 They have supported our point
 sanathan panrapara main sanyasi guru bhakt hota he to uma kisi sanyasini hai jo apane guru ke viruddh ja rahi hai
 Shankaracharya said that in Hinduism, Acharya in Sanatan Dharma looks at religious systems and Uma tell which Acharya is saying that it is appropriate to worship Sai
 aapako bataa den ye vivaad tab shuru hua tha jab dwarika peeth ke shankaracharya swami swaroopanand saraswati ne kaha tha ki hinduon ko sai kii puja nahin kerani chahie

 argedy kii punargathit rashtriya kaaryakarini main party supremeo lalu prasad yadav ne apni patni rabari devi ko kaaryakarini kaa upaadhyaksh manonith kiya
 Lalu also retained his two sons Tej Pratap Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav along with daughter Misa Yadav as a member of the National Executive
 lalu yadav ke is kadam ko lekar upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne lalu parivaar par tanj ksaa he or kaha he yah baat ab spasht ho chuki he ki argedy ek paariwarik upkram he
 Sushil Modi said that the manner in which Lalu has included his wife, daughter and two sons in the National Executive on the injury of Danke, it has become clear that in the Rashtriya Janata Dal, words like national and public are misleading people should not be
 modi ne kaha ki jis tareeke se lalu ne 1997 main party ke sabhi senior netaaon ko darkinar karte hue rabari devi ko party main number do bana diya tha usee cheez ko 2018 main ek baar phir se doharaaya gaya he
 Modi said that the RJD is a 'for the family, by the family and of the family' party, from which it is dishonest to expect democracy

 Taking a dig at Shivanand Tiwari, Modi said that Shivanand Tiwari, who studied Lalu Chalisa by breaking politics, has forgotten JP and Lohia and feels that centers of higher education like Chanakya Law University and Chandragupta Institute of Management in Patna and International University in Nalanda Is meaningless uttar pradesh kii yogi adityanath sarkaar ke shapath grahan ke baad se hi sabko is baat kaa intjaar tha ki upi kii nai sarkaar kii pehali cabinet baithak kab hoti he
 This was also the reason

 Now that the government has announced the debt waiver of the farmers in the cabinet meeting, in a way PM Modi's promise has been fulfilled
 vipaksh aarope laga rahaa he ki piem ne jab vaayada kiya tha to kisi seemaa kaa zikr nahin kiya tha lekin sarkaar ne mahaj ek lakh rupee tak ke karj maaf kiye hai jabaki sarkaar kaa kahana he ki karjamaafee kii paridhi main takreeban 92

 com / 7hd5qq16ua After the Madrasas in Uttar Pradesh, the Yogi Adityanath government is now going to tighten the number of private schools
 privet skulon main fees ko manamaane dhang se badaye jane ko lekar abhibhavak aksar shikaayat karte rahete hai
 Taking a break from this, the Yogi government has made it mandatory for all private schools to put their fee structure on the website and they have been given time till December 31 to do so
 sarkaar is babat jald aadesh jari karne ja rahi he
 This order will be applicable to all private and public schools, which charge more than 20 thousand fees annually
 haalanki sarkaar ne alpsankhyak sansthaaon or isai mishnariyon kii taraf se chalaae ja rahe skulon ko is aadesh se alag rakhane kaa faisla kiya he
 Let us know that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath saw a presentation of the Department of Secondary Education on Tuesday evening
 ismemprivet skulon kii manamanior duusare shulk lagaana rokane ke liye suzav die gaye
 After the presentation, it has also been decided that suggestions should be sought from the people in this regard, so that the opinion of the people can be known before bringing the bill
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki khud yogi adityanath ne bhi pregentation dekhne ke baad nijee skulon par lagaam ke liye kai suzav die hai
 Recognizing these suggestions, the Education Department is going to bring the Private School Bill in the coming winter session
 sarkaar kii koshish he ki agle shaikshanik satr ke pehle sabhi nijee skulon ke liye fees ko lekar niyam tay kar die jaaen
 If the suggestions in this presentation are implemented then private schools will not be able to raise fees more than 5 percent every year
 saath hi fees badhotaree ke anupaat main unhen apane shikshakon or karmchaariyon kaa vetan bhatta bhi badhanaa hoga
 After the presentation was over, UP Deputy CM and Education Minister Dinesh Sharma said that the arbitrary private schools will no longer work
 jis tareeke se ye abhibhavakon or chaatro ko pareshaan karte hai, ab us par roak lagaai jaaegi
 We have a meeting with the Chief Minister today
 puraa prajentation unhen dikhaaya gaya he
 After uploading all the suggestions made on the website of the Education Department, suggestions will be sought from the parents
 phir is disha main kadam uthaae jaaenge
 The purpose of this whole exercise is to curb the arbitrariness of schools so that parents and students do not have to put much pressure
 saath hi quality ajukeshan sabhi ko mili
 Only a few days are left in Holi
 bos ne abhi chuttee apruv nahin kii he isliye aap railway tikat bhi nahin le paae hai
 In such a situation, it is difficult to get a confirmed ticket in such a huge crowd
 jaahir he aise main aapkotatkaal tikat ke bharoserahana hoga
 But there is no less fight to cut the Tatkal ticket
 lekin ghabrie nahin
 From IRCTC website, we have brought seven surefire tips for ticket deductors which will help you get confirmed Tatkal tickets
 1
 Install adblocker on your computer or laptop: First of all install adblocker on your computer or laptop
 ab aap sochenge ki iskaa tikat kataane se kya matlab, to ham aapako bataate hai
 You must have noticed that whenever you open any website through Chrome or Mozilla, many types of ads start coming automatically
 kuch aisa hi www
 irctc
 co
 also occurs in aise aid tatkaal tikat kataane ke dauraan aapke liye musiibat khadi kar sakate hai kyonki isse aapkaa samay barbaad hota he
 So it is better that such ads be blocked so that its pop ups do not bother you while cutting tickets
 2
 Use two ids: Always use two ids
 agar aapke paas IRCTC par sirf ek hi acount he to apane dost yaa rishtedaar ye ek duusare acount kaa password maang len
 Then log both ids but be aware that both ids are open on different browsers or else both of your ids will be logged out automatically and the whole game may get spoiled
 3
 Find out when the Tatkal is opening: By the way, in any train, the immediate quota opens 24 hours before
 lekin ham aapako bataa den ki agar koi train apane gantvay se khulkar duusare din aapke stesan par pahunchati he to waisi trainon kaa tatkaal kota us train ke gantvy se khulne ke 24 ghante pehle khul jaataa he
 In this case, you have 48 hours
 to tatkaal tikat lene ke pehle koshish karen ki pehle aisi trainon kaa pataa kiya jaae jisamen 48 ghante pehle tatkaal kota khulata ho
 By using this formula, you can stay in profit
 4
 Fill the passenger information first: As we know, the immediate quota opens at 10 am
 aap koshish karen ki paisanger information list ko pehle bhar len
 Because if you start this work at 10 o'clock, your time will be wasted and here, in a matter of seconds, the quota becomes full immediately
 paisanger informension list bharne ke bhi do tareeke hai
 First way: Once you go to the passenger list, fill all the information before 10 pm so that when you go to cut the ticket, all the details will automatically reflect in the drop down
 aapako bas use select karnaa hoga
 This will save you time
 doosraa tarika:ye tarika he master list kaa
 This is a facility in IRCTC where you can fill all the information beforehand
 aapako baad main bas use select karnaa hoga
 You can save many minutes by doing this
 5
 Keep all the documents ready in advance: Before getting the tickets cut, keep all your documents ready
 masalan, ID number, Debit / Credit Card number yaa netbanking number
 Try to remember all these numbers so that time is not wasted
 6
 Try 2nd AC first: If you are cutting AC ticket then try 2nd AC first
 kyonki zyaadaatar root par 2AC kii tulana main 3AC zyada teji se bharta he
 In this case, the chances of getting tickets in 2AC are increased
 waisi trainon main tatkaal tikat kataane kii bilkul koshish naa karen jisamen tikat milane kii sambhaavna kam ho
 7
 pement ke liye hameshaa netbanking kaa istemaal karen:ye sunakar aapako thodaa ajeeb lag saktaa he lekin ye sach he ki Debit / Credit Card kii tulana main netbanking main pement zyada teji se hota he
 Because in Debit / Credit card you have to fill the card number and the other details
 lekin netbanking main aisa kuch nahin karnaa padataa
 Payment Always use the payment gateway of HDFC / ICICI
 ye baaki getwe se zyada teji se process hota he
 So here are some tips that can help you get confirmed Tatkal tickets
 dua he in tips kii madad se aap is saal holi main apane parivaar or doston ke saath apane ghar par maujuud rahen
 The rest is Happy Holi

 Anishia jumped from the roof and committed suicide or someone pushed it, it has not been confirmed yet, but an eyewitness says that Anishia fell from the roof and held the grill and hung it for a long time
 chashmadid ke mutabik, anisia ne khud ko bachaane kii puri koshish kii, lekin antat uske haath se gril chhot gaya or girakar uski maut ho gai
 Two laborers working near Anishia's apartment have revealed this in their testimony to the police
 police ne bataaya ki donon mazdooron kaa daawa he ki unhone anisia ko apni ankhon ke saamne girte dekha
 He told that after jumping from the roof, Anishia hung out of the roof for a while holding the grill
 chashmadidon kaa yah bayaan bataa rahaa he ki anisia ne khudakushi karne se pehle bachane kii aakhri koshish kii thi
 However, according to both workers, Anishia eventually fell down
 neeche giri anisia pehle boundry wal se takaraai or uske baad farsh par gir padi
 Eyewitnesses said that Anishia did not fall directly to the ground, but first hit her back against the boundary wall and then after that she fell on the ground
 anisia ke girane ke baad inhen donon mazdooron ne aas-paas ke logon ko shor machaakar ghatana kii jaankaree di
 In a message sent to many people just before Anishiamaut, her husband wanted to divorce Mayank, Anishia had told her husband Mayank Singhvi responsible for her death
 ab pataa chalaa he ki anisia apane vaivaahik jivan se khush nahin thi or mayank se talaak lene ke bare main soch rahi thi
 a friend of Anishia told that Anishia had not only made up her mind to separate from Mayank but was also thinking of taking a separate house for herself
 anisia kii saheli ne pahchaan ujagar na karne kii shart par bataaya ki vah aakhri vyakti thi, jise anisia ne marane se pehle massej kiya tha
 This was Anisia's last message

 "all these messages jumped from the third floor of their house in Panchsheel Park, Delhi, by the hostess Air Hostess Anishia on whatsapp, that afternoon from 2 to 56 minutes to 3 to 11 minutes
 lekin iske thik ek ghante baad yani thik shaam ko chaar bajkar 12 minute par anisia ne apni saheli ko jo massej bheja, wo behad daraanevaala tha
 He wrote "I am going to kill myself
 mayank ne mujhe is haal main pahunchaa diya he
 He finally kicked me out of the room, but the damage he has done
 uski bharpai nahin ho sakati
 "see Anishia's beautiful life in the pictures and before Anishia's friend sitting far away would prevent her from doing so, Anishia jumped from the third floor at exactly 18 minutes after four thirty minutes
 iske aage jo kuch hua, wo har kisi ko pataa he
 In the last message, she told her husband that Anishia messaged her husband Mayank, brother Karan Batra and mother Suman Batra before dying
 ye saare hi massej bataa rahe hai ki anisia jindagi main kuch bada faisla karne ja rahi thi or kitni jaddojahad se jujh rahi thi

 And he had taken my phone

 'kam se kam anisia ke ye aakhri massej to saaf-saaf bataa rahe hai ki usne apni maut ke liye saaf-saaf mayank ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 Anishia's brother Karan Batra said that on the day of the incident Anishia sent him a message and asked for help
 anisia ne massej main likhaa tha, 'mayank ne mujhe kamare main band kar diya he
 This man Mayank is taking my life

 The superhit song 'jumme Ki Raat' from Salman Khan's hit film 'kick' was also recorded in the voice of Salman Khan earlier, but his second version in the film, sung by Micah, was used

 i told him that i like his song, but he only said that i should listen to it again and send the song in my voice
 " Salman says that, 'when Micah congratulated me for the song Hangover, i was shocked to say that, wait for the next song i sung' Jumme Ki Raat ', after which he got very upset, Because he felt that his singing song had been canceled

 tippaniyan On the other hand, Micah says that "salman Bhai sang very well 'jumme Ki Raat and i asked him to release the song in his voice
 main jakarta main tha, jab mujhe raat ke 12
 He got a call at 30
 maine unase kaha ki mujhe unka gaanaa pasand he, lekin unhone hi kaha tha ki main ise dobaaraa sun luun or apni aawaaj main gaanaa bhejun

 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has decided to change the dress code of its workers after 64 years to adopt an artificial belt instead of leather but declined the proposal to change the khaki knicker to pants
 sangh ke akhil bhartiya prachaar pramukhadow
 Manmohan Vaidya told, 'this change will be applicable by organizing Sangh Shiksha Varg in may-june this year
 chamade kii jagah kritrim belt ke saath uskaa bakal bhi ab tambe kii bajaay steel kaa hoga
 "asked if the Sangh has made any other changes to the uniform other than the belt, whether it would be permissible to wear full pants instead of half pants, which some activists have been demanding for a long time, Vaidya said," No other changes have been made other than the belt
 ’unhone bataaya ki abhi tak sangh ke log chamade kii jo belt lagaate the unhen khaastaur par kanpur kii un tenariyon se liya jaataa tha jahaan vadh kiye gaye jaanwaron kii khaal kaa prayog nahin hota he
 He said, 'the Sangh always kept the condition that the belt supplied to it should not be made from the skins of slaughtered animals
 ’chamade kii bajaay kritrim padaarth kii belt ke badlaav kaa kaaran puche jane par unhone bataaya ki kuch sadasyon, visheshat: jain samudaay ke logon ko chamade kii belt par aapatti thi
 They felt uncomfortable wearing it, even though these belts were not made of slaughtered animal skins
 sangh ke manchon se aise sadasyon kii ore se aksar aagrah hota tha ki chamade kii belt kii jagah kritrim padaarth kii belt lee jaae
 Vaidya said that we have decided to change this due to the availability of synthetic options easily in place of leather
 isse jo log chamade kii belt pahanane main hichak mahasoos karte the, ve ab sahaj mahasoos karenge or sangh kii bhi khaas tenariyon par nirbharta samaapt ho jaaegi
 The first change to the dress code of the union was made in 1940
 vaidya ne bataaya ki british kaal main half pant or kameez donon khaaki rang kii hua karti thim or kameez par aresas ankit tambe kaa billaa laga rahata tha
 1940 Changed the shirt to white instead of khaki
 unhone kaha, ‘khaaki half pant or khaaki kameez kii bajaay khaaki half pant ke saath safed kameez adhik suruchipurna lagata he
 The publicity chief said that the second change was made in 1947
 tab tak sangh kaaryakarta shakhaon main edi se unche long boot pahante the
 Then, instead of long boots, the usual black shoes were changed and now after 64 years, this is the third change
 unhone kaha, ‘sangh hameshaa parivartan ke paksh main rahaa he
 The Sangh changes itself whenever a change is required

 co / cxertqw1wi — Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) June 25, 2016 bharat or pakistan main rahane vaale sikh samudaay kii dharmik aasthaa ke liye ahm kartarpur galiyare ko lekar donon deshon ke bich talkhi bad gai he
 Pakistan has termed India's response to the proposal to finalize the agreement to open the Kartarpur Corridor as childish and said Islamabad's response will be mature
 pakistan ne samjhaute se jude masaude ko bharat se saajha karte hue ise antim rup dene ke liye bhartiya pratinidhimandal ko apane yahaan aane kaa aamantran bheja tha
 But India said that the Pakistani delegation should come here
 pakistan ke videsh vibhaag ke pravaktaa mohammad faisal ne kaha ki islamabad ne samjhaute se jude vistrut prastaav ko saajha karte hue bhartiya pratinidhimandal ko aamantran bheja tha, taaki iske taur-tareekon ko antim rup diya ja sake
 But instead of giving a positive reply to Pakistan's first, India asked the Pakistani delegation to come to New Delhi and two possible dates for this meeting - 26 February and 7 March were suggested
 faisal ne pakistani media se baatcheet main kaha, 'jahaan tak bharat ke jawaab kii baat he to usne bachakaane tareeke se khedjanak bartaav kiya he
 We have also received a similar response from India earlier in September 2018 on Prime Minister Imran Khan's letter
 bharat ke rukh ke ulat pakistan is ati mahatvapurn masale par bahut paripakv tathaa sochaa-samajha jawaab degaa or bharat kii pahal par bahut jald pratikriya degaa
 'significantly, the much awaited Kartarpur corridor will connect Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur, Pakistan with Dera Baba Nanak of Gurdaspur district, India
 mana jaataa he ki sikh dharm ke sansthaapak guru nanak dev ne apane jivan ke antim din kartarpur main gujaarey the
 The opening of this corridor will allow Sikh devotees to visit this historic shrine where Guru Nanak Dev spent his last 18 years
 is bich faisal ne aarope lagaaya ki bharat kii taraf se pichley varsh sangharsh viraam ke ulanghan ke 2300 maamle saamne aae or yah maamle or bad rahe hai
 He said that Pakistan is responding to the firing from India without provocation
 faisal ne kaha ki agar vah (bharat) shanti kii bhashaa bolegaa to ham shantipurna tareeke se jawaab denge or agar goli kii bhashaa bolta he to ham goli se jawaab denge
 On January 17, Faisal dismissed India's charge of sinking Indian fishermen's boat in Pakistani waters
 bataa den ki 19 janvari ko bharat kii ore se jari ek note main kaha gaya tha ki pakistan samudri suraksha agency (piemesa) dwaara machuaaron kii naav par golibari kar use dubaaya gaya
 India had lodged a strong objection, calling the incident as malicious and impractical
 jabaki bharti tatarakshakon ne sudama puri naamak is naav main savaar 6 machuaaron ko bachaa liya, vahiin 1 kaa koi pataa nahin laga
 Faisal denied India's allegations, saying that the PMSA does not operate in the area where the incident is being reported
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki pakistan ke exclujiv iconomic jone main bhartiya machhuvaare aksar avaidh rup se machhliyaan pakadte hai
 Faisal said that the PMSA runs anti-poaching operations in these areas under international rules
 uttarakhand congress ke pradesh adhyaksh kishor upaadhyaay or aryendra sharma ko lekar pradesh main nayi siyasat shuru ho gayi he
 Somewhere Congress supporters are opposing giving Kishore Upadhyay a ticket from Dehradun's Sahaspur, while elsewhere Congress workers from Tehri are calling him here
 donon hi jagah ke congressiyon ne rajdhani ke karyaalay main pradarshan shuru kar diya hai
 The ruckus by Aryendra Sharma faction about declaring himself as a candidate from Sahaspur is so overwhelming that Aryendra supporters have been occupying the Congress state office of Uttarakhand for the last three days
 halaat is kadar bekaabu hai kii har taraf sirf hangaamaa or todphod ke nishaan hi baaki rah gaye hai
 a pro-aryendra activist also attempted self-immolation
 aryendra is baat ko lekar bhi khaase ugr hai ki apni tehri vidhansabha seat ko chhodkar kishor upaadhyaay aakhir kyon sahaspur se chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai
 Kishore Upadhyay's Sahaspur connection Congress state president Kishore Upadhyay was earlier elected as an MLA from Tehri
 lekin 2012 ke vidhaan sabha chunaav main kishor nirdaleey pratyaashee dinesh dhane se chunaav main parrast ho gaye tab se lekar aaj tak dinesh dhane or kishor main 36 kaa aankada he or aise main harish ravat ne dinesh ko na keval puraa samarthan kiya balki harkadam par dinesh ko upar kaa darja dekar kishor se adaavat main koi kasar nahin chodi
 If reliable sources are to be believed, this is a new tactic of Harish's politics that Kishore was handed a ticket from Sahaspur
 harish ravat ke is daanv se chaaron khaane chit ho chuke kishor itane vivaadit ho gaye hai ki aaj congressi hi unke murdaabaad ke naare laga rahe hai
 Harish Rawat's thoughtful strategy worked and when the Congress list was released, Kishore was given a ticket from a seat where the Congress itself is setting fire to the rebellion
 jaise hi ye ghoshnaa hui is seat par congress ke liye chah saal se bhi zyada se taiyaari kar rahe aryendra sharma ke samarthak virodh pradarshan par utaaru ho gaye sharma ke samarthak ab sahaspur se kishor ko ulate paanv waapas bhejne ke liye congress mukhyalay par dat gaye hai
 Harish Rawat bets on his own people! There is no one in the state Congress more seductive than Harish Rawat
 ab tak jo bhi unke saamne khadaa hua us ko harish ravat ne na keval haashiye par laakar rakh diya balki uske raajnneetik bhavishya ko hi kinare laga diya
 The entire state witnessed the battle of Harish Rawat and Kishore Upadhyay which has been going on for the last several days, Kishore kept attacking Harish Rawat with his statements every time and Rawat used to laugh at his statements all the time
 harish ravat ko shaayad samay kaa intjaar tha unhen pataa tha ki kishor unke changul main jarur fansenge
 Because Harish Rawat knew that the time would soon come when he would be able to show his strength and strategy to the teenager who is dreaming of sitting after Harish Rawat on state power
 aakhir harish ravat ne vahi kiya, kishor upaadhyaay ko unhone is kadar laachaar kar diya he ki khud kishor bhi nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 After all, in Harish and Kishore, the tussle between Talkkishore and Harish Rawat has been expressed by both the leaders
 upaadhyaay ne ravat ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad unke kaamon par na keval sawaal khadey kiye balki party line se hatakar kishor ne sarkaar ko khub chittiyaan bhi likhin
 Kishore Upadhyay was against the government on the grounds that the minister of Harish Rawat's kitchen cabinet is not working properly
 isko lekar upadhyay hameshaa se hi sawaal khadey karte rahe hai
 Alam has been that Kishore Upadhyay has also made such a statement about familyism and ticket distribution in the past, which directly hit Harish Rawat's chest
 kishor ne kaha ki wo party se maang karenge kii ek parivaar se ek hi vyakti ko tikat mili
 It is evident that Rawat was demanding tickets for his son and daughter Anupama and has even started campaigning for him among the public
 kishor kii ye baat harish ravat ko itani nagavar gujri ki ravat ne apane bayaan main ye tak kah diya kii har koi chahta he ki uskaa betaa-beti uski viraasat sanbhale or party main aise bayanon kii koi jagah nahin he
 However, the party did not give tickets to any of his family

 ) supreme court ke jaj justise chelmeshwar ne ek baar phir vivaad ko janm dete hue intervyuu de daalaa he
 Not giving interviews is also an instruction in the rules set for the conduct of judges
 lekin justise chelmeshwar ne karan thapar ko die is intervyuu main ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki wo niyam faislon par intervyuu ko lekar he
 Interviews can be given on other issues
 justise chelmeshwar kaa ye kadam ek badi chintaa kii vajah banataa he
 First thing to worry about
 justise ne khuleam un simaaon kaa atikaraman kiya he jo nyaayik anushaasan ke liye khud supreme court ne tay kiye hai
 Every decision is the opinion of the judges but not personal
 vah bharat kii nyaaypalika kii aawaaj hota he or usamen agar jaj apni nijee avadharana viksit kare to vah chaahe jitani behatar ho lekin galat udhaaharan prastut karti he
 The conscience of the judges cannot break the discipline of the courts
 nyaaypalika samvidhan or kanoon kaa anushaasan dusron se paalan karaati he vah khud ise bhang karegi to iskaa phayda netaa hi uthaaenge
 Think, what will happen if the judge starts raising such a voice from the army or security forces
 desh main loktantr ke naam par or loktantr kii aad main araajaktaa aa jaaegi
 Leaders and political parties are trying to break every system and put their feet in it
 iskaa sabase bada udhaaharan police he jisaki vishwasaneeyata or karypranali shunya se bhi neeche chali gai he
 After independence, we could build our system but the police became the easiest means to fulfill the selfishness of the leaders
 thane bikate hai
 
 
 Things like these have become very common and accepted
 police ke baad kii aglaa nishaanaa bani nyaaypalika
 However, if the judiciary had tried to protect itself from politics, it would not have been seen today
 bhrashtachar upar se shuru hota he
 Leaders are at the top of power, so they had more responsibility, which they did not play and the result was seen as corrupting the entire system
 justise chelmeshwar ne pichhali baar jab press conference kii thi tab hi unhone nyaaypalika ke bheetar kii khadbadahat ko saamne laa diya tha
 But on the same day one of his leftist leaders D
 raja se apane ghar main mulaakaat kii jisase unki apni aawaaj kii nishpakshta kaa str kam ho gaya
 The same happened in an interview to Karan Thapar on 7 April when he did not speak directly to the question of allotting the special case to a special bench, but when he was reminded of Jayalalithaa's disproportionate assets case, he agreed with her Came out of justise chelmeshwar engeesi kanoon ko radd karne ke khilaaf raay dene waalon main shaamil the
 If the senior-junior questions about allocation of work start to arise in other parts of democracy, then there will be chaos in the country
 justise chelmeshwar kii raah par duusare jaj chalane lagenge to bhi desh main loktantr kii kya dasha hogi ye sochaa ja saktaa he
 Now the discussion of hope
 justise chelmeshwar ke kadam ne nyaaypalika ko ekadam satark kar diya he or us par thodaa dabaav bhi bana he
 The hope is that adequate arrangements will be made to not take any such step like Justice Chelameswar
 nyaayik anushaasan kaa dayera vistrut hoga taaki jaj apni asahmati jaahir kar saken
 There is barely three months left for Justice Chelameswar's retirement and he also announced in this interview that i will not take any post of any government after retirement
 ye sabase sakaaratmak baat unhone kahi he
 If the other judges and judges of the High Court also follow the same leak, then the credibility of the judiciary will definitely increase
 lekin anushaasan kaa sakhti se paalan kiye bagaiyr is desh ke samvidhan or loktantr ko bachaana mushkil he
 Politicians can start by making the police clean, but they are not expected to

 ambedkar kaa cartoon banaae jane kaa kadaa virodh kiya
 He said that strict action should be taken against the culprits
 isse pehle, ensiiarti kii kitaab main dow
 The Rajya Sabha proceedings were adjourned till two and a half hours after two adjournments due to heavy uproar over the issue of publishing the alleged cartoon of Ambedkar
 yah maamla us samay shuru hua, jab maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri kapil sibbal prashnkaal main kendriya vishvavidhyalayon main anya pichhadaa varg ke chaatro ke bare main congress ke dow
 Bhalchandra was going to answer Mungekar's supplementary question
 usee samay basapa ke brajesh pathak ne ensiiarti kii kitaab main dow
 The issue of publishing the alleged cartoon of Ambedkar was raised
 pathak ne kaha ki dow
 Ambedkar has been insulted, which his party will not tolerate
 unhone kaha ki isaki javabdehi sunishchit kii jaani chahie or iske liye jimmedaar vyakti ko istipha dena chahie
 Other members of his party and BJP, JDU, RJD, Left members supported his point and expressed deep displeasure over the publication of Ambedkar's cartoon
 pathak ne ensiiarti kii kitaab ke us panne kii photocopy bhi sadan main dikhaai jisamen baba sahib kaa kathith cartoon prakashit hua he
 However, this sensitive matter seems to be heating up
 bajet satr ke chauthe din loksabhaa kii kaarywahi bina kaamkaaj ke dinabhar ke liye sthagit kar di gayi
 On the occasion of International Women's Day, Speaker Sumitra Mahajan congratulated everyone in the Lok Sabha on Thursday but did not cause a ruckus
 tidipi, tiemasi samet kai vipakshi dalon ke saansadon ne banking ghotaalaa or andhra pradesh ke liye vishesh package kii maang ko lekar hangaamaa jari rakhaa
 Amid the uproar, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anant Kumar said that the government is ready to discuss the banking scam under 193
 telugu desham party lagaataar andhra pradesh ke liye special package dene kii maang kar rahi he to congress party ke saansad lagataranirav modike desh chhodkar bhaag jane or banking ghotaale ko lekar sthagan prastaav kii maang kar rahe hai lekin sarkaar iske liye taiyaar nahin he,bijepi kaa kahana he ki vipaksh banking ghotaale par bahes se bhaag rahaa he kyonki use dar he ki agar bahes hui to upie ke jamaane ke banking ghotaalon par se bhi pardaa hat jayega
 The proceedings of the House started at 11 am but it was adjourned till 12:00 pm
 sadan main hangaamaa jari rahane kii vajah se spikar ko din bhar ke liye kaarywahi sthagit kerani padi
 The special thing is that both the BJP and the opposition want a debate on the banking scam but the quarrel is under which rules the debate should be held
 congress or vipakshi partiyaan niyam 52 ke tahat bahes chaahati hai jisamen voting kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 The Congress also alleges that the government has deliberately changed the subject of the debate so that it can focus more on the old cases, diverting attention from the scandal of Punjab National Bank
 lekin bijepi kaa kahana he ki congress kii taraf se notice 193 niyam ke tahat di gai he jiske tahat sirf bahes ho sakati he lekin voting nahin kii ja sakati
 Between 1952 and 1972, Parliament used to run 150 days in a year whereas now it hardly lasts even 50 days and most days there is a ruckus
 bill par bahes or charchaa kam hoti he
 It is obvious that common people are also now asking the question of how long mps will enjoy on the hard earned income of the people

 com / livsvcj6th Is it possible that scientists are superstitious? It is said that one should worship God before any major or minor work
 lekin jab vigyaan main desh kaa paracham lahraane vaale vaigyanik aisa karte hai to sawaal uthta he ki kya ye andhvishwaas he yaa aasthaa
 At the same time, CNR Rao, a scientist awarded Bharat Ratna, says that he does not like the tradition of ISRO worship
 lekin ye isro vaigyanikon kaa apana nirnay he
 The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) is scheduled to launch Chandrayaan-2 on 15 July
 isro vaigyanik har launch se pehle tirupati balaji mandir main jaakar rocket puja karte hai
 They offer small models of rockets there, so that they can succeed in their mission
 sirf bhartiya antariksh agency hi nahin, america antariksh agency nasa, roosi vaigyanik samet duniyabar ke vaigyanik andhvishwaas main bharosa karte hai
 Do tricks aaie
 
 
 Know about the superstition of scientists from all over the world
 roosi antariksh vaigyanikon ke andhvishwasaspes main jane se pehle bas ke pahie par peshaabaroosi antariksh yatri yaan main savaar hone ke pehle jo bas unhen lonchpad tak le jaati he, uske pichley daahine pahie par peshaab karte hai
 The story began on 12 April 1961 when Yuri Gagarin was about to go into space
 ve yatra se pehle behad baichaiyn the
 He was very fast urinating
 unhone bich raste main bas rukvaa kar pichley daahine pahie par peshaab kar diya
 His mission was successful
 tab se yah totaka chal rahaa he
 Romantic songs played before space travel Music played for astronauts in Russia before going to space
 isaki shuruyaat bhi euri gagarine ne kii thi
 After boarding the rocket, he asked the Mission Control Center to play some music
 control centre ne unke liye romantic gane bajaae
 From then until today all the astronauts play the same songs that were for Gagarin
 wo rocket nahin dekhte antariksh yatri jisase unhen janaa hota herusi antariksh yatri us rocket ko tab tak nahin dekhte, jab tak ve usamen baith nahin jate
 However, their training is conducted in simulated rockets
 gagarine ke guest book main karnaa hota he signecharyuri gagarine yatra se pehle apane offis main rakhe guest book main hastakshar karke antariksh main gaye the
 Since then, considering it a lucky charm, all the astronauts embark on a journey after signing in the guest book of Gagarin
 har safal launch ke baad ek paudha lagaaya jaataa hairus kaa baconur cosmodrome duniya kaa pehla or sabase bada lonchpad he
 a plant is planted after every successful launching for over 50 years
 baconur main ise avenue of heroj kehete hai
 If there is no accident, then write the name of the woman on the cooling pipe
 Before going on a space journey, the Russian Cosmonaut writes the name of a woman on the cooling pipe so that the accident does not occur
 kehete hai ki ek baar kisi ne ye kaam nahin kiya tha isliye haadase main 47 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 No rocket launches on 24 October Two major accidents occurred just before the launch at Baikonur on 24 October 1960 and 1963
 in haadason main saikadon logon kii jaan gai
 Therefore there is no launching on 24 October

 He told an interview to an English newspaper that he did not want to see this process
 aap ise andhvishwaas maano yaa kuch or par isse mishan safal hua tha
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited ISRO during the Mangalyaan mission
 protocol tha ki jab tak piem isro main rahenge koi vyakti mishan control centre ke andar-baahar nahin aa ja sakegaa
 But Arunanan was given special permission to go in and out due to his habit
 isro vaigyanik har launch se pehle tirupati balaji mandir main jaakar rocket puja karte hai
 Small models of rockets are offered there
 isro ke ek purv nideshak har rocket launch ke din ek nai shart pahante the
 There are many scientists still doing this

 This practice dates back to the times of the first American astronauts Alan Shepherd and John Glenn

 Congress leader Digvijay Singh, who faced the charge of supporting the minorities, on Tuesday accused Narendra Modi, the RSS and the BJP of spreading 'sheer lies' and projecting them as 'anti-hindu'
 digvijay singh ne kaha ki aresas or modi ke logon ne soshal media main unhen 'dogvijay' or 'pigvijay' jaise apshabd kahe hai
 Digvijay Singh's blog begins with the question 'am i anti-hindu
 ’ unhone un logon ko apane ghar aakar jaanch karne kaa nyotaa diya he, jo sanathan dharm ke prati unki nishtha par ungali uthaate hai
 Digvijay Singh said that he hopes that all other people who have been unfairly affected by the Sangh propaganda will try to understand them well
 unhone kaha, ‘main jaanata hum ki jo kuch bhi main kah rahaa hum uskaa ‘sanghee giroh’ andekhi karne ja rahe he
 Nevertheless, it is my duty to record what i believe in the record
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘maine jo daawa kiya he agar aap use nahin maanate hai to raghogarh main mere atithi ke taur par aapkaa swaagat he or aap khud isaki jaanch kar len
 The road to Raghogarh is three hours from Bhopal
 ’singh ne aresas ke vichaarak vir saavarkar par bhi hamalaa kiya
 He said that he was associated with Arya Samaj and was a 'strong opponent of Sanatan Dharma'
 unhone kaha ki unke guru dwarka ke shankaracharya hindutv kaa matlab spasht nahin kar paae the
 Digvijay Singh said that he believed that the word was first used by 'veer Savarkar', a staunch Arya Samaji, who strongly opposed Sanatana Dharma
 unhone kaha, ‘sanathan dharm ke prati arya samaaj kii ashishnutaa gyaat he
 The Arya Samaj also does not allow the use of its premises for religious ceremonies according to Sanatan Dharma
 ’digvijay ne kaha ki gayatri mantra die jane ke baad se vah 1969 se puja kar rahe hai
 They all fast on Ekadashi and go to Pandharpur to worship Vitho Ba for the last 21 years
 digvijay singh par aksar alpsankhyakon kaa samarthan hasil karne vaale muddon ko uthaane kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa rahaa he
 The Congress General Secretary said that he is a good-faith Hindu
 unhone kaha ki yah unka kartavya he ki muslimon, isaayiyon or anya alpsankhyak samoohon ke khilaaf sanghiyon or unke vetanbhogi peshewaron dwaara failaai ja rahi galat baton ke khilaaf khadey hon
 He said in his blog, 'bjp's Hindutva has nothing to do with religion, but a trick to cheat the innocent Hindus
 ek acha hindu sangh brigade ke vipareet hameshaa sabhi dharmon kaa sammaan karata he
 'digvijay said that he worships for half an hour every day and was given' initiation 'by Shankaracharya of Dwarka and Joshi Math and there are nine temples at his residence in Raghogarh in Madhya Pradesh, where poojas are performed every day
 digvijay singh ne kaha, ‘mujhe sanghiyon or ahmedabad ke nikat manipur sanand main sanskaar dham se kaam kar rahe modi kii ore se rakhe gaye vetanbhogi peshewaron dwaara soshal media par sarvaadhik gaali khaane vaala vyakti hone kaa durlabh saubhaahgya hasil he
 The 'gang' above has sometimes called me 'dogvijay' Singh, and sometimes 'pigvijay' Singh, who will probably be younger than my grandson
 ’hindu sanathan dharm ke saath apane judaavon kaa ullekh karte hue unhone apane blog main kaha, ‘jo log yah maanate hai ki main hindu virdohi hum, ve isapar gaur karen
 Or do they know any more pious Hindu in BJP and RSS than this
 agar jaanate hai to main unase milanaa chaahunga
 Digvijay Singh said, 'sometimes i am expected to convert to Islam and sometimes to Christianity
 prachaar ke taur par unke prashikshan ke dauraan sanghiyon ko saraasar jhooth failaane kii baat sikhaai jaati he
 But i will not blame them or their parents, but should be blamed for the rites offered to them in Sanskar Dham or RSS branches
 ’digvijay singh ne kaha, ‘iske baavjood sangh or bijepi or unka brigade mujhe hindu virdohi bataata he
 He also said that the nine temples located at his residence in Raghogarh have been worshiped daily for more than fourteen generations and that four of them have 'jyoti' burning continuously for twenty-four hours and they run the Ved Pathshala at Hanuman Temple Waley is also the chairman of the trust
 logon se apana blog padhane ko kehete hue unhone twit kiya, ‘mujhe hindu virdohi, muslim samarthak or hindu virdohi raajnneeti karne vaala bataaya gaya he
 Taking a dig at the BJP, Digvijay Singh said that apart from selling Lord Ram, what has the BJP done
 digvijay singh ne bijepi se sawaal kiya, 'kahaan gaye wo rupee jo ram mandir ko banavaane ke liye ikattha kiye gaye the?' digvijay singh ne ek baar phir gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko bhi khari khoti sunai
 According to Digvijay, 'before the elections, Modi talks about development and administration but as soon as the elections come closer he starts speaking against the minorities
 'digvijay singh ne kaha, 'main unase (modi se) jaananaa chaahunga ki secularism or communalism kaa matlab kya he
 We would like to debate this in front of the media on this
 main unase kahana chaahunga ki wo apana kaam dekhen
 ' dilli main sarkaar gathan par sargarmi ko dekhte hue aam aadmi party ne bijepi or uparajyapal najeeb jang par hamalaa tej kar diya he
 AAP leader Ashutosh tweeted that BJP has named its name 'fugitive Janata Party'
 ashutosh ne likhaa he ki bijepi main phir se chunaav ladane kii himmat nahin he
 Targeting the Lieutenant Governor while crossing the boundaries, he asked the question, 'do they read the Constitution?' BJP has renamed itself as - Bhagoda Janta Party

 But today the talk of all these 'fathers' means Salim Khan
 rupahale parde par saleem khan kisi parichay ke mohataaj nahin hai
 He is the father of Salman, Arbaaz and Sohail Khan
 hindi film insdustry main sabase safal script riter, screenple or dialog riter hai or haal hi unhone apni choti beti arpita kii bade dhoomdhaam se shaadi bhi kii he
 Salim Khan is 79 years old today
 lekin 1996 ke baad parde or lekhan se lagbhag dur rahe is 'indori khan' ke bare main aisi kai baaten hai, jinase ham anjaan hai
 The hallmark of Salim Khan's success is incomplete without Javed Akhtar
 yah isliye ki in donon ne 70 or 80 ke dashak main kul 24 filmon kii patakatha likhi, jisamen 20 filmein superhit hain
 Not only this, the salim-javed duo was also the first name to shine on screen as a script writer
 yahi nahin, is jodi se pehle kisi ko bhi script, screenple or dialog likhane kaa saajha kaam nahin diya jaataa tha
 Some things Personal life Kisleem Khan was born on 24 November 1935 in Indore
 unke pita police main the
 At the tender age, mother's shadow arose from the head of Salim Khan
 1964 main saleem khan ne maharashtra kii brahman ladki sushila charak se shaadi kii
 After marriage Sushila changed her name to Salma and on December 27, 1965, she got the pleasure of children as Salman Khan
 saleem or salama ke chaar bachche hai
 Salman was followed by Arbaaz Khan, Sohail Khan and Alvira
 1981 main saleem khan ne apane jamaane kii mashhoor dancer hellen se shaadi kii
 Both had no children, after which they adopted a little girl and named Arpita nearly two decades ago
 hero banane aae themumbai aakar saleem khan kii ichha actor banane kii thi
 He was initially hired at a salary of Rs 400 per month for a minor character
 unhone lagbhag 14 filmon main chote-mote role bhi kiye, lekin bataur actor kuch khaas baat nahin ban pai
 Among the films in which Salim Khan appeared as an actor are 'third Floor' and 'sarhadi Lutera' in 1966, 'deewana' in 1967 and 'faithful' in 1977
 dosti jab jodi ban gaisalim khan acting main haath-pair maar rahe the
 Javed Akhtar was writing the dialogue for 'sarhadi Lootera'
 javed ko yah mauka asal dialog riter kii tabiyat bigadane ke kaaran mila tha
 Well, this is where both of them became friends
 saleem khan un dinon lekhan main bhi koshish kar rahe the or riter-diarect abraar alvi ko acist karte the
 Javed Akhtar used to assist Kaifi Azmi

 'kaka' gave a big opportunity till now in the Hindi film industry, the work of screenplay, story and dialogue was not available to any one person
 parde par unke naam ko bhi zyada tawvajo nahin di jaati thi, lekin saleem-javed kii kahani main rajesh khanna ne twist laa diya
 Actually, Rajesh Khanna had to buy a house (blessing) in those days
 iske liye unhone film 'hathi mere saathi' sin kii
 But it was a remake and Rajesh Khanna was not getting the storyline as much
 rajesh saleem-javed se mil chuke the or unhone donon ko film ke screenple par haath saaf karne kaa mauka diya or saath hi ek vaada ki parde par likhaa hoga 'saleem-javed'
 salim-javed's pair came together for the first time in 'andaz', but 'hathi Mere Saathi', 'sita Aur Geeta', 'yaadon Ki Baaraat' gave them a romantic mood
 amitabh bachchan ko 'zanjeer', 'sholay' or 'don' jaisi filmon ke jariye 'engri yang main' bananaa bhi saleem-javed ke kalam kii hi jaaduugari thi
 However, in 1982, during the film 'shakti', this friendship broke and then both of them got separated
 donon ke aakhri baar 1987 main 'mistar india' ke liye saath kaam kiya
 Javed Akhtar continued to write after the gradual break-up, but Salim Khan opted out of writing for films after 1996
 javed se algaav ke baad unhone 'naam', 'pathar ke phool', 'tufaan', 'majdhaar' or 'dil tera divaana' jaisi filmon kii kahani likhi, lekin purana jaadu nahin chalaa paae
 So he slowly made a distance

 Industry organization FICCI has said that many proposals like increase in excise rate, revival of customs duty on petroleum products are going to increase inflation, there is a need to revisit them

 FICCI has suspected that a two percent increase in the excise rate will affect industrial activities and the recovery process may derail once again
 udyog sanghathan ne kaha he ki vyaktigat iskar ke maamle main upar ke slab main to kaaphi raahat di gai he lekin 1
 No relief was given in the annual income category of 60 lakh to three lakh rupees

 vitt mantri pranav mukherjee ne 2010-11 ke bajet main das pratishat kii dar vaale iskar slab ko jo ki pehle 1
 60 lakhs to lakhs which earlier 1
 60 lakh se teen lakh rupee tak tha
 Similarly, 20 percent slab has been proposed to be raised from five lakh to eight lakh instead of three lakh to five lakh rupees
 30 pratishat kii ucchtam dar ko paanch lakh kii jagah aath lakh rupee se upar kii aay lagane kaa prastaav he
 1 of this proposal according to FICCI
 60 lakh rupee se lekar teen lakh rupee ke bich kii aamadani waalon ko koi phayda nahin hua he
 Hence the limit of tax free income 1
 6 lakh se badha kar do lakh rupee kii jaani chahie
 The industry organization has termed the mandatory provision of mentioning PAN as problematic
 vitt mantri ne iskar kii dhara 206 ee ke tahat sthaayee khaataa sankhya (pan) kaa ullekh nahin kiye jane par 20 pratishat kii dar athwa jo bhi dar lagu hogi inamen se oonchi dar par tids kaatane kaa prastaav kiya he
 The organization suggests that the mention of PAN be optional for senior citizens, farmers, transporters and those whose income does not exceed the exemption limit or for those who are illiterate

 rajdhani dilli main maujuud bhikhaariyon ke liye dilli hoicourt se raahat bhari khabar ai he
 During the hearing of a case on Wednesday, HC abolished the sentence in such a case
 ab agar dilli kii sadakon par koi bihari bheekh maangata hua pakadaa jaataa he, to use sajaa nahin hogi
 The court has also said that all beggars should be provided with basic facilities and health services
 HC ne sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha ki bhikhaariyon ko kisi bhi prakaar kii sazaa dena moolbhoot adhikaron ke khilaaf he, isliye unke khilaaf kisi bhi tarah kaa aapraadhik maamle main sajaa nahin di ja sakati
 The Delhi High Court has removed beggary from the category of crime while giving relief to beggars
 court ne kaha ki kisi bhi bhukhe vyakti ko rhite tu spich ke tahat roti maangane kaa adhikaar he
 Actually, if any person was caught while begging, then he had a provision of punishment of 1 to 3 years, which has now been abolished
 bhikhaari ke duusari baar pakade jane par usko 10 saal tak kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan tha, lekin ab hoicourt ke aadesh ke baad use khatm kar diya gaya he
 The Mumbai Prevention of Bagger Act 1959 was enacted in Delhi on 2 June 1960
 bhikshavriti ko aparaadh kii shrenee se hataa diya gaya he isliye jaise bhikhaariyon ke pehle pakade jane par unke fingerprints liye jate the abaisa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The court has upheld section 11 in its order
 is section ke tahat agar koi vyakti kisi se balpurvak bhikshavriti karaata he to usko 3 saal tak kii sajaa ho sakati he
 That is, if a person performs begging under a syndicate from a child, elderly woman or disabled, then the provision of legal action against that person is still open
 bhikshavriti ko aparaadh kii shrenee se hataane ko lekar haalanki centre sarkaar ke vakil anil soni kaa maananaa he isse dilli main bhikhaariyon kisankhya or bad jaaegi
 Because beggars from Delhi and also from states will come to Delhi so that they can be legally protected
