 Not even "another state within the state"
 yah sab 1999 kii baaten hai
 The army no longer commits political indecency

 The new army is "apolitical" and has returned to its "barracks"

 There is no step that causes shivering in the veins or the stock market collapses or there is a stir in the military squads of India

 Officially - on public forums and in talk shows - even in meetings of drawing rooms and cigar lounges - it is being said that the Pakistani army has now joined the country

 In practice, this change has almost been completed after 65 years
 aaj pakistani fouj apane desh kii sabase badi siyaasi party kam or duniya kii paanchavin sabase badi fouj zyada he
 There are only a few weeks left and General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani will be conducting elections for the first time in the country's troubled history from one democratic government to another
 jaahir he, fouj ke alaava or koun shant tareeke se chunaav kii guarantee de saktaa he
 It may therefore seem that Pakistan's notorious and fragmented-minded democracy, or that the disorder of democratization was finally resolved by the uniformed men at the Rawalpindi headquarters, did not work in Islamabad's sherwani-shalwar psychologists
 yah kayapalat haalanki koi saidhantik nahin he
 Actually something else has happened, something that we all have been waiting for

 When our conversation reached democracy and governance, while showing towards everyone present in the camp, he said, "this is not ours but your work
" jaaie apana kaam kariye
 "pakistan is going to go to polls on May 11 and the best thing is that its soldiers have now learned to demonstrate political neutrality
" yah badlaav achaanak nahin hua he
 Kill a new enemy whom she cannot overturn on her own accord; Restrictions of the international financial system that can only be punished in lieu of running tanks on Constituency Avenue itself; Contribution to the global media which she can never fully control; Many bearded colleagues leave him; And perhaps the most important thing is that for a decade, due to military intervention, people had to suffer in the eyes of the people, security flaws arising from it and above all, political maturity proved wrong
 isaki vajah se unke hero or netaa parvej musharraf ko saidhantik rup se sahi brookes ke haathon jaleel hona padaa: yani is islamic ganraajya ke samaaj or sakriy naagarik sansthaanon kii badaulat yah badlaav aayaa he

 Today, in the light of the upcoming election and the withdrawal of American / NATO forces from Afghanistan, everything has returned to the same traditional and constitutionalist pattern

 He will talk to you about polo, not politics
 vah aapse aapke sampadak kii shikaayat nahin karegaa balki aapaki badai karegaa
 And in his frequent conversations, he will throw out jokes that are usually heard at Harvard or Brookings University
 vah vimarsh or prativimarsh kii baat karegaa, vyapaar sandhiyon or punarvaas par bolegaa, kshetreey sainya sahyog or paraspar shanti bahaali par baat karegaa

 The military is now brand new and its managers are a new generation of military and intelligence operatives who have been pushed by General Kayani under their own shadows: low-profile, fun-loving, well-educated and somewhat enigmatic poker players such as the young right wing The father of militarism, General Ziaul Haq, has persevered to defend what he called "the only institution in Pakistan that matters"
 jaahir he, vah yahaan kii fouj he
 At present, the infamous mantra of Pakistan's militarized political economy has changed with Allah, Army and America
 ab sirf ek aawaaj aa rahi he: army, army, army
 Apparently, this change in the behavior of the Pakistan Army has come after 10 years of continuous grappling with the most difficult anti-extremist, anti-terror intelligence operations, which no other modern army would have faced

 or ve shaayad sahi bhi hai
 In the case of Afghanistan, the Pakistani military has finally understood what work it is better at: kneeling, sticking to the ground
 vah jaan gai he ki agar laduya sambhav nahin he to peeche hatana bhi nahin he
 Some of the army brigades in the border areas of Waziristan have done miraculous work and after years of adopting the deceptive American philosophy of 'keep on burning', they have finally established stability and peace
 drone hamalon ke khel main fouj ne ek hi baat kahi ki yah america kii karrwai he
 And it has proved effective
 kaaphi samay pehle fouj ko yah ilm ho gaya tha ki america fouj vahaan jeetne ke uddeshy se nahin, sammanjanak tareeke se vidaai ke liye lard rahi he lekin pakistani fouj ko to isliye laduya he ki vah vahaan tiki rah sake
 His strategy then changed and he prepared some bargaining ground for negotiations in Doha, Dubai, Kabul and Paris, responding to the Indian move to woo the Afghan National Security Force, despite a salala on the Durand Line in late 2011 The incident, a clash with the loc in early 2013 or the regular Uzbek / Tajik-dominated NDS attacks once in a few weeks, made it difficult for him
 Hey
 ab fouj saudebaaji kii sthiti main aa chuki he
 It is quite impressive to see the army whose history was going to start the quarrels, trying this kind of outcome
 yah ek bade rajnatik aakhyaan kaa nayaa or unnat sainya pahalu he jahaan ‘‘sainya-ranneetik gaharaai’’ kaa arth yah he ki ‘‘agar tum mujhe satta main apana dalal bananaa chaahate ho’’ to aisa tabhi hoga jab ‘tum mujhe apana sainya prashikshak banane doge’’ or yah sab kuch tabhi ho sakegaa jab ‘tum mujhe apana kaam karne do or main tumhen tumhaara kaam karne duun

 or yah maanate hue ki brussels main afghanistan-pakistan-america kii vaarta ek ‘‘kor samooh’’ ke taur par islamabad dwaara rachi gai thi jisamen bharat or iran jaise desh shaamil nahin the, to yah is baat kaa saboot he ki videsh vibhaag jaise naagarik pakshakaron ko ise baahar nahin rakhaa gaya tha
 However, the atmosphere of Pakistani homes and neighborhoods has changed
 ve din lad gaye jab koi bhi kisi patrkaar ko peet detaa tha or gali-nukkad ke konon se aapako uthaa liya jaataa tha

 Kamal Nath did not stop here

 All three are seats

 Therefore, Munda had to resign on 8 January

 pehle bhi congress ne 2005 or 2008 main shibu tathaa 2006 main madhu kodaa kii sarkaar ko samarthan diya tha, lekin sarkaar main shaamil nahin hui thi
 For the stability of the government, he was not limited to the Congress, but also brought the RJD to the government
 2009 main congress or argedy ke alag hone ke baad yah pehla mauka tha jab donon ne hemanth sarkaar kii madad karne ke liye haath milaayaa

 iske baad pes ko majaboor hokar kam ranking ke khilaadi vishnu vardhan ke saath jodi banani padi
 He will pair with Sania in mixed doubles as part of the deal
 sania ne kaha, ‘is vivaad se kisi kaa bhala nahin hua
 This created bad blood between us and it is unfortunate
 mujhe khushi he ki yah samaapt ho gaya he or main ab liender ke saath milakar olympic main acha pradarshan karne or padak jeetne par dhyaan kendrit kar sakati hum
 'he said,' We should forget it now and concentrate on winning the medal
 liender wimbledon ke final main pahunchaa or yah sakaaratmak baat he
 Me and Mahesh lost and it is unfortunate
 hamen final main khelnaa chahie tha
 Sania said that her relationship with Bhupathi has also deteriorated due to the selection dispute
 unhone kaha, ‘us vivaad ko dimag se nikaalnaa aasaan nahin tha or vah mujhe pareshaan kar rahaa tha
 Such a situation was not created by what i had said, Mahesh and i are very good friends, but our friendship has also broken due to the dispute
 ’sania ne kaha ki vah mishrit yugal main bhupati ke saath jodi bananaa pasand karti lekin pes ke saath milakar bhi ve padak jeet sakate hai
 Sania told, 'I am a forehand player and Mahesh is a backhand player, so i was telling my choice
 lekin maine kabhi nahin kaha ki main kisi khilaadi ke saath kheloongi yaa nahin
 i am ready to play with anyone for my country
 ’unhone kaha, ‘liender kaaphi achche khilaadi hai or mere dost bhi hai
 i have played with him for a long time
 olympic main unke saath khelnaa mere liye sammaan kii baat he
 i am in good form, i won the French Open title with Bhupathi
 pes bhi wimbledon ke final main pahunche hai isaliye vah bhi acchhee farm main hai
 We have a good chance of winning a medal
 ’sania rashtramandal or asian tathaa effro asian khelon main padak jeet chuki hai or unhone kaha ki ab vah olympic padak apni jholii main daalana chaahati hai
 He said, 'I have 12 medals including Commonwealth, Asian Games and Afro Asian Games
 keval olympic padak jeetna rah gaya he
 So this time i hope to win a medal
 ’yah poochne par ki kya vah olympic se pehle pes ke saath abhyaas karengi to sania ne kaha, ‘main liender se nahin mili hum or na hi meri baat hui he
 He was in the Wimbledon final but could not meet him
 captain es pi mishra ne har kisi se sampark kiya or kaha ki vah 23 july tak sabhi ko landan main chaahate hai isaliye main tab vahaan pahunch jaaungi
 'sania said,' i am going to America and play in San Diego
 vahaan se main landan jaaungi or 23 july ke baad mujhe lagata he ki main liender ke saath abhyaas shuru karuungi
 'she did not agree at all with the idea that winning medals in mixed doubles would be easier than the others as it has a 16-team draw
 sania ne kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki yah galat he ki mishrit yugal spardhaa aasaan hogi
 People are saying that if you win two matches, you will reach the semi-finals and you will win the medal
 lekin dra kaaphi kathin he
 The best mixed teams in the world are included in the draw so winning the match will not be easy
 ’ For the first time, the pair of Alia Bhatt and Ranveer Singh are rocking through an ad video
 makemytrip ke ambesder bane aalia or ranvir ke do aid video jari kiye gaye hai
 In one video, Aliyataxi is seen as a driver and Ranveer is playing the role of a passenger in the form of a straightforward Bengali babu
 bollywood main akasar hatke kirdaar adaa karne vaalialiataxi driver ke bindaas role main shandaar dikh rahi hai
 At the same time, Babu Moshay's look is very full on Ranveer and at the same time he is speaking Bengali in the best style
 makemytrip kii or se jari kiye gaye is video ko utyub par saadhe chaar lakh se zyada darshak mil chuke hai
 Watch the video: In the second ad video, Aaliya was seen wearing a sari in a simple look
 or ranvir hip hop luk main ek star ke kirdaar main najar aa rahe hai
 In this video, Ranveer Chaicha looks funny in his funky look but Alia's funny style of speaking seems to be overshadowing Ranveer
 aalia kaa bolne kaa aisa andaaj aapane pehle kabhi nahin dekha hoga
 Watch the video: supreme court ne vyavastha di he ki kisi aaropee ko sajaa sunaate samay adaalatein na keval samaaj kii jaruraton or aaropee ke prati nishpakshta ke bich santulan banaaen, balki aparaadh peedit ko vaazib muaavja bhi dilaaein
 a division bench of Justice TS Thakur and Adarsh kumar Goel said in a judgment on Friday, "the courts need not only the nature of the crime, the penalty fixed, the aggravating and serious mitigating circumstances but also the needs of society and Consolidation should be taken care of, but also the need to give justice to the victim of crime
 'adaalat ne kaha ki aapraadhik maamle main sajaa ke faisle main budhimatta kii jarurat he
 Compensation should also be fixed after taking into consideration the medical and other expenses, suffering and trouble, loss of income and other facts to the victim
 khandpeeth kaa faisla sunaate hue nyaayamurti goyal ne peediton ko nyaay milane kii aksar hone vaali andekhi kaa zikr karte hue kaha, 'kanoon main badlaav or is adaalat ke faislon ke baavjood is pahalu par dhyaan nahin diya jaataa he
 "he said," In the absence of sufficient evidence, the plight of the victim cannot be ignored even if the punishment for the crime is not given properly
 peedit kaa punarvaas utana hi mahatvapurn he, jitna doshi ko sajaa
 The Supreme Court said that compensation can be paid under sections 357 and 357-A of Criminal Procedure Code 1973
 ---input IANS se Violence took place at a booth in Jamuria near Asansol during local bodies voting in West Bengal
 ye bavaal tab shuru hua jab tiemasi or sipiem ke kaaryakarta apni-apni party ke jhande lekar booth par pahunche
 According to the police, there was a clash between the workers of the two parties over sitting at the booth and when the police tried to chase them, they threw stones at the police
 kaaryakartaaon ne matdaan centre par khadi police vine ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya
 The police later had to lathicharge them to calm them down
 is ghatana main ek pulisavaale samet kai logon ke ghayal hone kii khabar he
 Voting for some time had to be stopped due to the ongoing uproar by supporters of both parties
 is bich khabar ye bhi he ki tiemasi ke ek kaaryakarta ne jamuria main ek iviem mashin ko bhi nuksaan pahunchaaya
 Today civic elections are being held in West Bengal, in which there is a close fight between the Left and Trinamool Congress
 ye chunaav isliye ahm hai kyonki sthaneey chunaavon main trinmul congress or congress ke bich gathbandhan tut chukaa he
 There are 81 municipalities in West Bengal
 pichley chunaav main inamen se 54 main left ko vijay mili thi, jabaki congress ko 13 main or baaki par trinmul ne kabja kiya tha
 In the last Lok Sabha election, the Trinamool Congress and the Congress contested the election
 nagar nikaayon ke chunaavon main yah gathbandhan tut gaya he
 The Left Front will benefit from this, but despite this its position is not likely to be good, because despite the break-up of the coalition, the star of the Trinamool Congress is seen at the height
 jhaansi
 As soon as the idea of bundelkhand comes to mind, the lines of worry on the forehead automatically begin to emerge
 pani kii kami, sookhe khet, kharaab saamaajik-aarthik sthiti philhal to yahi is ilaake kii pahchaan he
 How boring does life become without water? No major experiment is needed to know and understand this
 mahaj bundelkhand ke un kisaanon se mil lijie jo pani kii kami ke kaaran paidaavaar na milane par shahar jaakar mazdooree karne ke liye majaboor hai
 In the present situation, any small initiative which is helpful in changing this situation is no less than a lamp that burns dark × 4
 jhaansi se sate paraasai-sindh kshetra main coca cola india foundation, international crops research institute for da semi arid tropics (isiariesti) or neshnal research centre for agro forestry (esarsieef) ne sthaneey sahaayta samooh harithika ke saath milakar jal sangrakshan kii disha main saraahneey kaam kiya he
 Under this common effort, a total of eight check dams were built to conserve rain water in parasai-sindh region
 jiske kaaran monsoon ke baad bhi lambey samay tak pani kii uplabdhta sunishchit kii ja sake
 About 1250 hectare area of bachouni, Parasai and Chhatpur villages adjacent to these check dams benefited from this
 in check dam main lambey samay tak pani rahane par bhu-jal str main sudhaar hua he
 The effort is claimed to have improved the average groundwater level in the parasai-sindh region by an average of 2 to 4 meters, increasing crop yields by an average of 30 per cent after the monsoon
 coca cola india foundation ke project manager rajeev gupta kehete hai, ''buledkhand main pani kii kami se na keval kisaanon balki yahaan rahane vaale logon kaa jivan bhi prabhavit hota he
 Rabi yields are affected in this region due to lack of proper conservation of rain water
 ''chote prayaas bade phydaparasai gaanv ke 50 varshiya kisaan lallu paal kehete hai ''in check dam ke banane se rupye main athnni kaa phayda to hua he
 “the yield has increased twice
 paal urad, moongfalee or gehun kii kheti karte hai
 Increased yield brings more money in hand
 ''ek or kisaan khem chandra bataate hai, ''in check dam se pani kii uplabdhta behatar hui
 This gives wheat yield of 1 per hectare
 5 quintal se badhkar 1
 Been 8 quintals
 '' nishchit taur par isse unki aay badi
 Khemchandra has also recently bought a motorcycle
 paal or khemchandra kii tarah gaanv ke anya kisaan bhi in check dam ke banane se khush the
 This relief is undoubtedly a little in front of the farmers' suffering
 lekin sarkaar ke vishaal tantra ke liye ye nazeer se kam nahin

 aam aadmi party ke sabhi saaton pratyaashee dilli ke purna rajya kii maang ko lekar siyaasi ran main congress or bijepi se do-do haath kar rahe hai, lekin 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main kejariwal ne ek se badhkar ek diggajon ko dilli ke maidan utaara tha
 Today, four of those seven candidates have given goodbye to the Aam Aadmi Party
 jabaki baaki bache teen netaa party main hai, lekin haashie par pade hue najar aa rahe hai
 Let us tell that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Aam Aadmi Party turned journalist-turned-politician Ashutosh to Chandni Chowk, JNU professor Anand Kumar to north-east Delhi, Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi Rajmohan Gandhi to East Delhi, journalist-turned-politician Ashish Khaitan Delhi, Rakhi Birla from North Western seat, Journalist-turned-politician Janrail Singh from West Delhi seat and Colonel Devendra from South Delhi seat Sehrawat was made a candidate
 aam aadmi party ke in sabhi saaton ummidavaaron main se ek bhi jeet nahin sakaa tha
 The first thing that went to Rajmohan Gandhi is the interesting thing that all the seven candidates Kejriwal had fielded in 2014 to win Delhi
 unamem se chaar diggaj kejariwal se naata tod chuke hai
 The first to contest from East Delhi seat was Rajmohan Gandhi, who left Kejriwal
 rajmohan gandhi haar ke baad hi america waapas chale gaye or baad main party kii kisi bhi kaarykram main nahin dikhe
 Professor Anand Kumar, who tried his luck in the election field from North East Delhi, had said goodbye to the party along with Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan
 2015 main vidhansabha chunaav main aam aadmi party ke satta ke baad party main varchasv kii ladaai ke chalate professor anand kumaar ne kejariwal kaa saath chhodkar alag ho gaye
 In August 2018, journalist-turned-politician Ashutosh left Arvind Kejriwal after the Rajya Sabha elections in Delhi
 ek samay ashutosh ko mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke kareebi netaaon main gina jaataa tha
 Ashutosh had cited a personal reason behind leaving the party, but later it became clear that he had left the party, angry with those sent to the Rajya Sabha
 iske baad ashutosh ke istife ko mukhyamantri ne sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya tha or unhen maanane kii koshish kii thi, lekin wo apane faisle se nahin palate
 About a week after Ashutosh's resignation, Ashish Khatan, who joined the party, also broke away from active politics
 nai dilli seat se ummidavaar rahe ashish khetaan ne istipha dene ke samay kaha tha, 'philhal main puri tarah se legal practice par focus kar rahaa hum or sakriy raajnneeti main shaamil nahin hum
 '3 Leaderside Line: Rakhi Birla, Janrail Singh and Colonel Davendra Sehrawat are the leaders after the four leaders broke their ties
 ye teenon netaa philhal to party main hai, lekin puri tarah se said line kar die gaye hai
 Kejriwal had fielded candidates in the 2015 assembly elections after the Lok Sabha elections, in which all three had won
 lekin, dilachasp baat ye he ki kejariwal kii pehali sarkaar main mantri raheen raakhi birla ko dobaaraa mantri nahin banaaya
 Apart from this, Janrail Singh was elected MLA from Rajouri Garden seat, but during the Punjab Assembly elections, he resigned from Delhi Assembly membership and tried his luck against Akali Dal President Prakash Singh Badal
 lekin unhen jeet nahin mil saki
 Apart from this, Colonel Davendra Sehrawat is an MLA, but not very active in the party
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main kejariwal ne 2014 ke pratyaashiyon main se ek bhi nahin utaara he
 In this year's battle, the Aam Aadmi Party has announced the names of 6 candidates in seven
 isamen chandani chowk loksabhaa seat se pankaj gupta, uttar purvi dilli se dilip pandeya, purvi dilli se aatishi, dakshini dilli se raghav chaddha, uttar pashchim dilli se guggan singh or nai dilli se brijesh goyal se ummidavaar honge

 afzal guru ko faansee dete vakt supreme court ne apane faisle main ek jagah kaha he ki samaaj kii samuhik chetana ko santusht karne ke liye faansee zaruri he
 Now we or you should think how this collective consciousness is formed
 agar afzal guru or yaqub memon ke bare main samuhik chetana he to wo rajoana bhullar yaa rajeev gandhi ke hatyaron ke bare main alag kaise ho jaati he
 Whatever is the so-called collective consciousness is a reality
 aap yaad kiijie nirbhaya cond ke vakt bhi ek khaas kism kii ugr samuhik chetana nirbhaya ke hatyaron ko faansee ke liye lalkaar rahi thi
 Despite the fact that the late Justice Verma, who was trying to make his rape sentence tougher, refused to include the death penalty in his report, at that time, the collective consciousness of Raisina and the whole country also talked about hanging himself publicly
 uske kuch hi saal baad dilli main hi minakshi naam kii ek ladki ko saream chaakuon se god kar maar diya jaataa he

 tiger memon or uskaa parivaar dhamaake se do din pehle pakistan bhaag gaya tha
 Tiger and Dawood, the main accused in the Mumbai serial blasts, are still absconding but after a few days of detention in Karachi, Yakub Memon decides to come to India
 shila bhatta ne likhaa he ki uski patni rahin ne kaha tha ki ham isliye aae kyonki ham karachi main nazarband the
 We did not like it

 i did not mention this incident because you have sympathy with Yakub
 dhamaake ke cese ko har din cover karne vaale patrkaar bhi kehete hai ki yaqub kaa maananaa tha ki is dhamaake main tiger memon hi kasuurvaar he
 Yakub, an intern in Pakistan, told Tiger Memon that i am going to Gandhi's country
 jawaab main tiger memon ne tha ki gandhi mat bano, aatmasamarpan mat karo
 Now all these things have not been confirmed concretely
 kaha yah jaataa he ki khufia agency or yaqub memon ke bich kuch deal hui jise yaqub ne bakhubi nibhaayaa
 Could the deal never come on record, so it could not help in the case
 na hi kabhi yaqub ne bataaya
 But it is true that Jacob handed himself to the law but also brought seven other members of his family to India

 He said that the arrival of Yakub from Pakistan to India is a historic success of the Indian intelligence agency
 par isaki sazaa ko lekar raajnneeti ho jaati he
 In this politics too, touch of religion comes

 While hanging Afzal Guru, the Supreme Court has said a place in its judgment that hanging is necessary to satisfy the collective consciousness of the society
 ab hamen yaa aapako sochna chahie ki ye samuhik chetana kaise banati he
 If there is a collective consciousness about Afzal Guru and Yakub Memon then how does it diverge about the killers of Rajoana Bhullar or Rajiv Gandhi
 jo bhi he aisi tathakthith samuhik chetana hakeekat to he hi
 Remember, even during the Nirbhaya incident, a certain kind of fierce collective consciousness was daring to hang the killers of Nirbhaya

 a few years later, in Delhi itself, a girl named Meenakshi is publicly killed with knives
 samuhik chetana nadaarad ho jaati he
 Justice Verma was right
 samuhik chetana ke bharose kanoon nahin chal saktaa
 i give another example of how collective consciousness can be formed
 hamaare aaj ke mehmaan or mashhoor vakil ujjwal nikam ne jaipur main kaha ki kasaab ke paksh main ban rahi hawa kaa rukh badalane ke liye unhone jhooth bolaa ki kasaab ne matan biryani kii maang kii
 This statement left the collective consciousness silent but many people were shocked
 pitiai ke anusaar nikam ne yah bhi bataaya ki biryani kii baat bataate hi media main panel discshan hone lage
 Kasab was a terrorist and even hanged, but when this false fact became part of the election sloganeering, then people of special religion in the name of Biryani started being targeted that a government was feeding Biryani to the terrorist in the wake of their vote
 isse hota yah he ki jo log faansee kii sazaa kaa hi virodh karte hai wo akele pad jate hai
 At the time of Afzal Guru's execution, when those who were being hanged were being called traitors, the prominent political thinker Pratap Bhanu Mehta wrote in the Indian Express that there were disagreements with the court's decision
 (*change) aise sawaal karnaa deshadroh nahin he balki loktantr majboot hi hota he

 Those opposing the execution have also opposed the hanging of Rajoana and Bhullar

 Chidambaram was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on 21 August
 indrani mukherjee or peter ne ienex media maamle main chidambaram or unke betekarti chidambarampar aarope lagaaya tha
 Indrani and Peter are currently lodged in a jail in Mumbai in connection with the murder of Indrani's daughter Sheena Bora
 chidambaram ke khilaaf pravartan nideshaalay (idi) ne bhimani londringka ek maamla darj kiya he
 (input from agency) dilli main sampatti vivaad ke chalate ek mahila par tejaab phenkane kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 The attacker is said to be none other than the victim's brother-in-law, devar-deorani and 2 other relatives
 ghatana ke baad aaropee faraar ho gaye, jabaki peedit mahila ko aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 Where his condition remains critical

 She lives in Mangolpuri area of delhi with her family
 peeditake anusaar beeti raat kareeb saadhe 8 baje vah apane ghar se nikalakar apane pati kii dukaan par ja rahi thi
 On the way, Javed and Sona along with his brother-in-law Shamshuddin and his wife Nazmin stopped Shabnam
 ve chaaron milakar shabnam ke saath jhagada karne lage
 Meanwhile, the accused tried to forcefully drink acid on Shabnam and then put acid on her face and body
 jisase vah buree tarah se jhulas gai
 The victim fell unconscious at the time of the incident
 aaropee maukey se faraar ho gaye
 Someone informed the police and the victim's husband
 jiske baad shabnam ko ghayal haalat main mongolpuri ke sanjay gandhi aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 Where his condition remains critical
 peedit mahila ke pati ne bataaya ki uskaa chote bhai ke saath ek dukaan ko lekar pichley kaaphi dinon se vivaad chal rahaa he
 Because his father has named the shop to him
 jis vajah se aaropee chota bhai or uski patni samet saale aksar unke saath ladaai jhagada karte hai
 Due to this dispute, the accused party has registered fake cases against the victim's husband in various other sections including molestation
 inke bich pehle bhi marpet ho chuki he
 Due to property dispute, the victim woman and her family remain separated from the accused
 lekin aaropee paksh aaye din kisi na kisi baat ko lekar ladaai jhagade karte rahete hai
 Complaints have also been given to the police several times from both sides in this matter
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ghatana ke vakt kaaphi log vahaan maujuud the, lekin kisi ne bich bachaav karne yamahilako bachaane kii koshish nahin kii
 Rather, people kept watching the spectacle as mute spectators

 So far no arrests have been made in this case

 He said all these things while speaking to reporters after the Chief Ministers Conference on the issue of internal security
 yahaan aap pard sakate hai, narendra modi kaa puraa kaa puraa bayaan, jyon kaa tyon
 
 
 Congress is in a very bad condition now
 gujarat main do loksabhaa siten hai, jin par bijepi kii bhavy vijay hui, ye 2014 ke chunaavon ke liye congress ko sandesh he
 a message of public displeasure, which is an ultimatum to the Government of Delhi, i thank Gujarat for the grand victory
 aaj yahaan dilli main internal sicurity ke sambandh main meeting thi
 i said earlier that this may be the last meeting of the UPA government
 maine meeting main kaha ki piem manmohan singh ke netritv main pehle bhi aisi meeting hui
 What the Government of India did in ten years, meetings were held, cms came, they gave suggestions, a white paper should be presented to the country about the action taken by the Central Government on them
 ye meeting ek rasm ban gai he bas, siem suzav dete hai, piem sun lete hai, magar un par kya acshan liya gaya, yah desh jaananaa chahta he
 After all, everyone is feeling so much power and power
 or isliye maine piem se yah maang kii he
 i also said that a strong message should be sent from this internal security meeting
 puraa desh chhattisgarh ke saath he, raman singh ke saath he
 The country will neither accept the terror of Maoism, nor will it take shelter
 desh ladega, puri takat se ladega
 The entire Red Corridor from Pashupati to Tirupati has been bloody by the Maoists
 piem se maine meeting main aagrah kiya he ki maowad se nipatane ke liye do tarafa ranneeti honi chahie
 There are two types of areas, first, which are Naxal-affected areas, second, where the eyes of Maoism are fixed
 2012 main piem ne parliament main jawaab diya tha, chah bade shahar or mumbai se ahmedabad tak kaa hissaa unke nishane par he
 Now the Maoists are busy building urban bases instead of rural
 aaj raat ko piem naksal prabhavit rajyon kii alag se meeting kar rahe hai
 But where Naxalism is likely to spread, separate meetings should also be held for that
 sochna chahie ki jahaan he vahaan roka ja sake or jahaan fail saktaa he, vahaan bhi kaam ho
 In the context of NCTC, the Home Minister has not spoken in his discourse, PM has also not spoken but is on the agenda
 maine kaha ki aap bole nahin he isliye lagata to he ki aapkaa man kya he, phir bhi main is par puure aagrah se kahana chahta hum ki aap nai agency banaakar samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin kar sakate
 By creating a new agency, you reduce the morale of a well established agency
 jaise, piem kii chairmanship main planning kamishan pichley pachaas saal se kaam kar rahaa he
 This time you suddenly made NAC, then the planning commission became useless, it had no role
 aisi hi sthit ensiti ke kaaran hogi, jo nahin honi chahie
 a good work was going on inside the IB, that of MAC, that of MAC
 ek prakaar se kahen, to abhi usne apni jaden jamaai thim, achaanak se aap use ibi se lekar ensiti ko de rahe hai
 This means that a child named Mac, who was standing on his feet, orphaned him
 koi soch nahin he, rosemara kii tarah kaam nikaala ja rahaa he
 i made a serious charge today, i said that your talk is about national security, but your taxes are for state security
 desh ko rashtriya suraksha main ruchi he, aapaki ruchi raaj kii suraksha main he
 Therefore, you are using all the agencies for personal political use, and because of this you are ruining all these institutions
 centre sarkaar ne police balon ke aadhunikeekaran kaa kaam liya he
 In that i see that the budget that was in the year 2002, today is the same budget in 2013, no increase
 pehle 100 fisadi fund bharat sarkaar detii thi, phir unhone rajya par 25 fisadi boj daal diya
 Last time i suggested that reduce it, then increase the state's share to 40 percent
 isse state ke upar bardan bad rahaa he, bajet nahin badha rahe, bas kagaji karrwai badha rahe hai
 The Government of India has faith in the Panchayat, but not on the State Government
 chaahe wo upie ke dalon kii rajya sarkaar ho yaa endie ke dalon kii
 You give money directly to the panchayat, there is no problem in that
 magar aadhunikeekaran ke naam par alot kiya paisa rajya ko nahin dete, do-do saal tak tikaa tippanee chalati rahati he
 What is the tender, who is the vendor, keep asking, Hey you decide by making a guide line, make a prototype arrangement
 phir jaancho ki ho rahaa he ki nahin
 i said in the meeting that for those killed in Chhattisgarh, there is reverence, police personnel are killed, army soldiers are killed, there is reverence for them
 javaanon ke sir kaat liye jate hai, un javaanon ke liye shraddha he
 Two Kerala fishermen were killed, reverence for them
 maine saaf kaha ki aaj puure house ko chhattisgarh ke saath, dow
 Must stand with Raman Singh
 andhra main maovadiyon ne kuch baras pehle ek district colector ko kidanap kiya
 Seven Maoists were demanded to be released to release them
 usamen ek maovadi ek enjio kii cheirperson thi, padma naam kii
 She was also in jail
 unhen chhodane kii maang thi
 Who is this Padma? enesi ke member jo ek enjio chalaate hai, us enjio kii ye cheirperson hai
 Her husband is a known Maoist terrorist
 to ek activist jise chhodane kii maang maovadi kar rahe hai, vah enesi main ho auki enjio ke khilaaf kuch na ho, aisa kaise
 That's why i say that you talk about national security, but take action for state security
 chhattisgarh ke police javaanon ne jis par cese kiya, court main jo hua so hua, us par dibet ho sakati he, uske bari hote hi aapane usee raat use planning kamishan kaa member bana diya, jiske cheiraiman pradhanantri hai
 By doing this you destroyed the morale of all the forces of the state
 doosraa maine kaha ki ensitisi yaa jo bhi aap kar rahe hai, aap fedral strecchar ko durbal kar rahe hai
 All states run the country together with the Government of India, this big brother's attitude is not good
 grih mantri apane bhaashan main bole ki mizoram or tripura ko apana jhagada suljhaana chahie
 Hey brother, then what are you for, what will the Indian government do
 sarkaria ayog ne kaha tha ki do rajyon ke bich jhagade ke niptaare ke liye centre sarkaar ko ek thos maikenism bananaa chahie
 i have demanded from the government that the Chief Minister's report should be called and discussed on the Sarkaria Commission report
 aam aadmi party dwaara sarkaar banane ke liye sharten lagaae jane ke bich congress kii dilli ikai ne aaj arvind kejariwal ke netritv vaali party kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki vah jimmedaari se bachane kii koshish kar rahi he or use janadesh kaa sammaan karne kii chunauti di
 Congress legislator and former power minister Haroon Yusuf told reporters here, 'congress gave support so that AAP can form the government because they got the mandate from the people of Delhi
 aap ne sirf jimmedaari se bachane ke liye lambii fehrist bhej di
 ' pandraa varsh tak dilli par shashan karne vaali congress ko haal ke vidhansabha chunaav main maatr aath siten hi mil pai
 The party claimed that the 18 issues raised by Kejriwal in its letter to the Congress and BJP presidents had nothing to do with the legislature and this indicated a 'lack of knowledge' in the region
 usuf ne kaha, 'vaade karnaa or muft ke tohfe baantne kii baaten karnaa alag baat he or darasal vaisaa kar paanaa alag, agar chijen is tarah hone lagen to ek din vah america ke raashtrapati or sanyukt raashtra pramukh ko bhi patr bhej sakate hai
 ' ek hairaan kar dene vaale ghatnakram main congress ne kal raat dilli main agali sarkaar ke gathan kaa rasta saaf karne ke liye aap ko apane aath vidhayakon ke bina shart samarthan kii baat kahi thi
 However, AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal sought time during his meeting with Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung today and said that he has written to Congress President Sonia Gandhi and BJP chief Rajnath Singh seeking their views on 18 issues
 purv mantri ne kaha, 'unhone dilli kii janata ko gumraah karke vot hasil kiye
 i want to say to those youths who voted for AAP thinking that they will bring change, now they should demand that the party form the government and fulfill its promises

 In such a situation, people shopping online also need to be very cautious while shopping

 in / vatweb / Udit Narayan's son Aditya Narayan could not get much success in the career
 lekin apane atitude kii vajah se aditya aksar charchaa main rahete hai
 There have been many cases of misbehavior with the management at the airport, hitting the auto driver
 lekin ek baar phir aditya kaa naam baar phir soshal media par chaaya hua he
 The reason for this is that no accident is a new drama but a video
 bhojpuri web siries banaaengi ekta kapur, amrapali-vikrant honge starye video 2015 main bhojpuri star monaalisa ke saath aayaa tha
 The video features Monalisa and Aditya's liplock and bold dance
 vaise aditya kai bhojpuri filmon main gane bhi ga chuke he
 The songs of the viral video have been sung by Aditya himself
 big bos ke sijan 10 main najar aa chuki monaalisa, bhojpuri filmon kaa ek janamana naam hai
 These days, Monalisa is going to be seen in season 2 of the Bengali web series 'dupur Thakurpo'
 maharashtra main bijepi-shivasena kii tuuti 30 saal puraani dosticongress-ensipi ke samarthan se shivasena banaaegi sarkaarmaharashtra main shivasena or bijepi ke bich mukhyamantri pad kii khinchataan ke chalate donon kaa brallep ho gaya he
 The 30-year-old alliance of the two is thus broken
 bijepi ke sarkaar banane se inkaar karne ke baad shivasena apane siyaasi sameekaran ko durust karne main jute gai he
 It is believed that Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has started the exercise of forming a government with the Congress and NCP
 aise main bijepi ke liye bhale hi philhal maharashtra main satta ke raste band hote najar aa rahe hon
 But the saying goes that when one way is closed, many paths also open
 bijepi ke liye philhal nattejey nakaaratmak dikh rahe hon, lekin vyapak pariprekshya main dekhen to bhavishya main uske liye maujuuda ghatnakram phayda kaa sauda bhi ho sakati he
 Shiv Sena found Congress and NCP in Maharashtra 15 days before the results of the assembly elections, BJP and Shiv Sena got a clear majority
 lekin, mukhyamantri pad par shivasena ke ad jane ke chalate bijepi ne maharashtra main sarkaar banane ke kadam ko peeche khinchakar shivasena ko sarkaar gathan kaa mauka de diya he
 In such a situation, Shiv Sena along with its anti-congress and NCP is working to form a government
 isse bijepi ko lagata he ki congress-ensipi ke saath shivasena kaa safar bahut lanbaa nahin chal sakegaa, kyonki vichaardhaara ke str par ek duusare ke dhur-virdohi rahi hai
 BJP is eyeing Maharashtra, let us understand that after Narendra Modi came to power at the Center, bjp's graph is increasing in the country
 bharat ke uttar se lekar dakshin or purvottar se lekar pashchim ke kai rajyon main bijepi apane dam par sarkaar banane main safal rahi he
 Maharashtra is the second largest state in the country after Uttar Pradesh, which the BJP is eyeing
 2014 se pehle tak maharashtra main shivasena bade bhai to bijepi chote bhai kii bhoomika main thi
 In the 2014 Maharashtra assembly elections, the bjp-shiv Sena tried different luck while going together at the center
 bijepi or shivasena donon ko apni-apni raajnneetik takat kaa ehsaas hua
 As a result, the Shiv Sena was forced to accept the status of being a junior partner in the BJP government led by Devendra Fadnavis
 bijepi 2014 main akele dam par chunavi maidan main utarkar 120 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 The Shiv Sena was weakened
 In Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena was driven by high Hindutva, anti-muslimism and attacking ideology on Pakistan
 maharashtra main shivasena kaa balasaheb thakare ke dinon vaala jalawaa khatm ho chukaa he
 The result of this was that in the 2019 assembly elections, the BJP had to win 164 seats in the alliance and 124 seats for the Shiv Sena
 bijepi ne shivasena ke paale main daali gendbijapi ko maharashtra kii satta main apane dampar aane ke liye ek na ek din shivasena ko peeche chhodana tha
 In such a situation, the Shiv Sena is going to leave the BJP for the CM chair and join hands with the Congress and NCP
 aise main bijepi kii man kii muraad puri hoti najar aa rahi he, kyonki shivasena ke saath uskaa 1989 se gathbandhan chal rahaa tha
 In such a situation, the BJP did not break this mahayuti itself and put the ball in the Shiv Sena's court
 maharashtra main ugr hindutv kii akeli party bani bijepicongress-ensipi ke saath jane ke baad shivasena ko apane ugr hindutv kii raajnneeti or muslim virdohi siyasat se bhi samjhauta karnaa padegaa
 In such a situation, it was decided that the representative party of militant Hindutva in Maharashtra would no longer be the Shiv Sena but the BJP
 ayodhya par supreme court kaa faisla ramamandir ke paksh main aa chukaa he or modi sarkaar jammu-kashmir se dhara 370 ko hataakar bada daanv chal chuki he, jisase use apana siyaasi aadhaar badhaane or apane dam par satta main aane kii ummid najar aa rahi he
 Now Maharashtra is open ground for BJP
 With this, the field in Maharashtra is now fully open and there will be an electoral battle between BJP vs All Party in future political battle
 aise main bijepi ko yah ummid he ki vah narendra modi or amit shah ke netritv main akele 288 siton par chunavi taal thokkar apane nattejey ko kaaphi behatar kar sakati he
 While the Shiv Sena may form a government with the Congress and NCP right now, it will face difficulties in the political battlefield of the future

 Directed by Alankrita Srivastava, the film is produced by Prakash Jha
 kendriya film pramann board (CBFC) ne prakaash jha kii nai film 'lipstick under maay burka' ko certificate dene se inkaar kar diya
 CBFC has sent a letter to film producer Prakash Jha explaining the reason why the film has not been certified
 'lipstick under maay burka' ko sensor board ne bataaya 'asanskari', nahin diya certificatis vivaad par aaj tak se exclusive baatcheet main CBFC ke adhyaksh pehlaaj nihlani ne kaha - hamane film par kanchi nahin chalaai he
 But the film does not depict women properly so it cannot pass with an 'A' certificate
 film par kanchi na chalaane kii baat par pehlaaj ne kaha - agar ham aisa karte to producers court ja sakate the
 So we thought it better not to do so
 phir kuch filmon ko sensor board ne paas kar diya tha
 'jolly LLB 2' is a recent example
 asanskari 'lipstick under maay burka' ko mil chuke hai kai awordsashyam benegal kii salaah par pehlaaj kaa kahana tha ki ise paas nahin kiya gaya he or agar kahin kuch kanfusion he jo unako sensor board kii bajaay sarkaar se sawaal karnaa chahie
 CBFC chairman Pahlaj Nihalani has said that he has done his job and now the producers of the film can go to the upper body or court anywhere
 'beficre' ke kising seen par sawaal uthaane par pehlaaj ne kaha ki vah sab ek daayre main tha or riviging kamity ne ise paas kiya tha
 Then it was also an experiment so the two films cannot be compared
 tripal talaak ke maujuuda vivaad par tamaacha he Lipstick Under My Burkhalekina film to ek mahila ne banaai hapehlaaj nihlani se jab yah baat kii gai ki 'lipstick under maay burka' ko ek mahila diarector ne banaaya he
 On this, CBFC said that whatever they want to make but what will be shown and what not, the board will decide
 saath hi sensor board ke sanskari hone ke sawaal par pehlaaj ne kah hi diya ki sanskaar hamaare desh kii parampara he or sanskaar ko bachaane kaa kaam sensor board kaa hi he

 jabaki dekha gaya he ki jab-jab rahul ghatana ke fouran baad jate hai to bhi sawaal kiya jaataa rahaa he ki unke ke aane se prashasnic avyavashtha fail jaati he
 Not only this, even if Rahul does not go, his opposition says that where Rahul is missing
 is tarah rahul ke pehle jane
 Opponents are surrounded by the three conditions of late going and leaving
 aise rahul karen bhi to kya karen
 Uttar Pradesh General Secretary of Congress Nasim Qureshi says that BJP has a lot of problem with Rahul Gandhi
 bijepi waalon ko rahul ke jane se pareshaani he or na jane se bhi
 He has no rest in any way
 jabaki rahul gandhi siyasat karne ke bajaay logon ke dard ko baantne gorakhpur ja rahe hai
 BJP people know that Rahul Gandhi's departure will reveal his failure
 yahi vajah he ki rahul ke jane ko lekar bijepi pareshaan hai
 While children are constantly dying in Gorakhpur
 is yatra ke jariye maut kii vajah ko rahul gandhi kaaphi kareeb se samajhenge
 In fact, Rahul Gandhi is the MP from Amethi in Uttar Pradesh as well as the face of the current Congress politics
 aise main unka ferj banataa he ki jis rajya se wo saansad chunakar sansad pahunche hai vahaan ko logon ke dukh-dard main shaamil ho
 This is the reason why Rahul will meet the families whose children died due to lack of oxygen in Gorakhpur today

 pichley dinon 67 bacchon kii maut ho gai
 In such a situation, Rahul will visit the families of these children in their village and in the evening, Rahul will also visit BRD Medical College and take stock
 iske jariye wo sahi tareeke se chizon ko samajhenge
 With this excuse, Rahul will be able to deal with the reality of this disease

 The impact of inflation can be known easily by looking at the main face of the effigy of Ravana
 is ravan kii ek aankh hi najar aati he
 At the same time, other effigies are giving a message to people to vote more and more in the upcoming assembly elections
 ravat bataate hai ki unke paas paanch foot se lekar 25 foot tak ke ravan ke putale banane ke order hai
 The cost of these mannequins is up to 25 thousand rupees
 unke dwaara banaae ja rahe putale samaaj ko sandesh dene ke saath samaaj kii samasyaon ko jaahir karne vaale honge
 People associated with political parties are intent on attacking their opponents through effigies of Ravana
 vahiin putale banane waalon kaa kahana he ki ve aise putale nahin banaaenge jo kisi raajnneetik dal yaa kisi vyakti par hamalaa karne vaale hon
 They are doing the work of making effigies to express their problems
 dashahara par ravan ke putalon kaa to dahan ho jayega, magar in putalon ke sandesh logon par kitna asar daalate hai, yah to vakt hi batayega

 What the Supreme Court did to change the rules of arrest under the SC / ST Act, political parties have been competing which party should prove itself as the greatest leader of the Dalits
 sabhi party ko isaki chintaa he ki court ke is faisle se kahin dalit vot bank naaraaz na ho jaae, kyonki karnataka kaa chunaav to bilkul sir par he or 2019 ke loksabhaa ke chunaav kii gahamagahami bhi shuru ho chuki he
 This is the reason that one party after another wants to be seen doing something to reverse the Supreme Court's decision in this case
 bijepi or endie main shaamil sahyogi dalon ko lagata he ki sarkaar main hone kii vajah se is baat kaa thikra unheen ke sar par foot saktaa he ki wo is act kii dhar ko kamjor hone se bachaa nahin sake
 On Wednesday, 20 SC and ST mps from all parties included in the NDA, chaired by Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, met the Prime Minister in Parliament
 unase kaha ki sarkaar is maamle main jald se jald kadam uthaae or supreme court main punarvichaar yachika daakhil kare
 After meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Paswan said that the PM listened seriously to him and that his stand on filing a review petition was positive
 paswan daliton kii raajnneeti karte hai isliye wo is maamle main ek kadam aage chal rahe hai
 His party Lok Janashakti Party has already knocked on the door of the Supreme Court in this case and has filed a review petition on his behalf, despite not being a party in this matter
 paswan kii tarah kendriya mantri or republican party ke adhyaksh ramdaas athavle bhi is maamle main apni taraf se karrwai kar rahe hai
 He too sent a letter to the Prime Minister last week and said that the government should try to reverse this decision by knocking on the door of the Supreme Court at the earliest
 ek or kendriya mantri rashtriya loksamata party ke upendra kushvaha bhi is maamle main peeche nahin rahanaa chaahate the isliye unhone bhi mangavaar ko pradhanmantri ko is bare main chitthee likhakar media ko jari kar diya
 The condition of BJP itself is that the ministers themselves are writing letters to each other so that they can be seen doing something about it
 saamaajik nyaay mantri thavarchand gahalot is maamle ko lekar kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ko patr likh chuke hai
 Opposition is also putting up Damodhar Opposition leaders including Congress met President Ram Nath Kovind on Wednesday about changes in AC / ST Act
 is bare main twit karke rahul gandhi ne kaha ki supreme court kaa ye faisla aise samay par aayaa he jab desh bhar main daliton or adivaasiyon ke khilaaf atyaachaar kii ghatnaayen babbti ja rahi hai
 The Congress is also alleging that the Modi government is to blame for what has happened in the court, because it could not plead the case properly in front of the court
 congress ke netaa pramod tiwari ne kaha ki agar sarkaar thik se is maamle ko court main rakhti to ye faisla hi nahin aayaa hota jisko lekar itani haituba machi hui he
 This was a decision, on 20 March, the Supreme Court had said that the AC ST Act is being misused so now the arrest can be made only after the approval of the SSP by not directly arresting the matter
 agar mukadmaa sarkari karmchaaree ke khilaaf he to use behaal karne vaale adhikari kii ijaajat ke bina giraftaar nahin ho sakati
 Dalits and tribals make up about 30 percent of the population in the country, so every party needs their votes
 mana jaataa he ki haal ke kai chunaavon main bijepi kii jeet kaa kaaran yahi rahaa ki daliton ne badi sankhya main bijepi ko vot diya tha

 Shoaib has issued a statement saying that even though he has signed the divorce agreement, the one who knows the truth is above
 yani, shoeb abhi bhi dil se maanane ko taiyaar nahin ki aaysha se unhone nikaah kiya tha
 Then why Shoaib bowed? Barati has come from Lahore
 dulhan sania mirza ke haathon main shaadi mehandi bhi saj chuki he
 There is just a week in Nikah, but the groom Raja is lost alone
 aaysha siddiki se nikaah ke vivaad main agar kisi sabase zyada fajihat hui he to wo sania ke hone vaale pati pakistani cricketer shoeb malik hi hai
 Admittedly, Shoaib agreed on Wednesday to sign the divorce memorandum, sensing the advice of the fraternity elders and the seriousness of the situation, but he still could not accept this truth from his heart
 media main jari bayaan main shoeb ne kaha ki main ye tay karne vaala koi nahin hum ki kya sahi he kya galat kyonki sach kya he ye upar vaala jaanata he
 i did what was right in an amicable way because every day the circumstances were getting far from logic
 shoeb ke is bayaan se saaf ho gaya he ki unhone tahe dil se talaakname par dastakhat nahin kiye
 This was also confirmed by the statement of Major Qadiri involved in this agreement

 In fact, the Siddiqui family, through their lawyer, had filed an application in the court and decided to stop the marriage of Shoaib and Sania

 The day of the marriage was near

 In such a situation, the threat of getting married at the last time worked for the Siddiqui family

 His passport is still in court

 It is his responsibility to bring lasting peace in India

 The Prime Minister of Pakistan (imran Khan) said that talks between the two are the only solution for the people of both countries to get out of poverty and it is important to work together for the development of the region
 haalanki, bharat ne baatcheet ke pakistan ke prastaav ko khaarij karte hue kaha he ki aatankwaad or vaarta saath main nahin chal sakate or kirgistan kii rajdhani bishkek main 13-14 june ko shanghai sahyog sanghathan (essio) se itar donon pradhanmantriyon ke bich kisi dwipaksheeya mulaakaat kii yojana nahin he

 naam jaahir nahin hone kii shart par adhikari ne kaha ki sanyukt raashtra aise satat kadam dekhnaa chahta he jinase aatankiyon kii gatividhiyaan band ho jaaen
 Answering a question related to the US assessment on tensions between indo-pak, a White House official said that until these groups are isolated, it is very difficult for India and Pakistan to achieve lasting peace

 electric vaahanon ko lekar centre sarkaar kii nitiyon se rajya sarkarein dari hui hai
 State Governments say that the introduction of electric vehicles will reduce the consumption of petrol and diesel and this will reduce the revenue coming through VAT
 centre sarkaar ne 2030 tak desh main maujuud 30 fisadi nijee kaaron, 70 fisadi cormcial kaaron, 40 fisadi bason or 80 fisadi dopahiyaa or teen-pahiyaa gadiyon ko electric whical main badalane kaa faisla kiya he
 At the same time, state governments are worried that petroleum products are outside GST
 electric gadiyon ke aane se unhen waite se hone vaala rajasav kam ho jayega
 This will be a big loss for them
 rajya sarkarein chaahati hai ki agar centre sarkaar kii electric gadiyon kii niti se unke rajasav main kami aati he to centre sarkaar uski bharpai kare
 Earlier, while implementing GST, the Central Government had said that the Central Government will complete the reduction in the GST revenue of the state governments for five years
 ab electric gadiyon kii niti se dari hui rajya sarkarein kah rahi hai ki jiesti ke maamle kii avadhi or paanch saal badhaai jaae
 In order to compensate for the loss of electric vehicles policy
 aaie
 
 
 Explain to you the advantages and disadvantages of electric vehicles policy 1
 kifayatikaphi research ke baad ab electric gadiyon kii keemat kaaphi kam ho gai he
 The GST on this has been reduced from 12% to 5%
 2
 No harm to the environment: Electric vehicles are 100 percent eco-friendly
 inase koi jahrili gas nahin nikalati
 India's share in global warming will be reduced
 vaayu or dhwani pradooshan behad kam ho jayega
 3
 kam mentanence kharch:paaramparik gadiyon kii tulana main electric gadiyon kii mentanence laagat behad kam aati he
 Because it does not contain liquid like engine oil
 zyaadaatar hisson ko badalane kii jarurat nahin padati
 Is India ready for such trains? 
 
 paksh ke javababharat main 1945 se hi kolkata main electric trom chal rahi he
 Thousands of electric trains are running
 inase samay or paise kii bachat ho rahi he
 According to the NITI Aayog, by 2030, if electric vehicles start operating as per the prescribed formula, then the road running vehicles will save 64 percent of the energy used
 saath hi carbon utsarjan main 30 pratishat kii kami aegi
 The arrival of electric vehicles by 2030 will save 153 megatons of diesel and petrol in the country
 isse kareeb 3
 9 lakh crores will be saved
 in paison kaa upyog electric gadiyon kii takneekon ko viksit karne main ho saktaa he
 Of the 20 most polluted cities in the world, 13 are in India
 electric gadiyon ke aane se in shaharon main vaayu or dhwani pradooshan kam hoga
 According to the Paris Environmental Treaty, India has to reduce its share in global emissions of toxic gases by 2030
 isiilie centre sarkaar rashtriya i-mobility yojana banaai he
 Is India really ready? 
 
 virodh main daleelenzyaadaatar bhartiya petrol-dijal vaali gaadiyaan pasand karte hai
 Because electric vehicles are weak pickup
 gati bhi dhimi hoti he
 The biggest reason is the lack of electric charging points and centers
 socity of manuphaccrers of electric wheekals ke anusaar bharat main march 2016 tak 22 hajaar electric wheekals utpaadit hue the
 Of these, only 2000 were four-wheelers
 jabaki, 2011 se 2015 ke bich electric gaadyon kaa utpaadan puri duniya main 94% badha tha
 Most of them in China, America and Europe
 nagpur main shuru hui ola electric whical yojana fail ho gai
 Ola drivers were returning electric vehicles
 ve waapas paaramparik kaaron kii taraf chale gaye
 Because the charging station used to have long lines and the cost was coming up
 2016 main kul 30 lakh gaadiyaan desh main biki jabaki electric gaadiyaan sirf 22 hajaar
 In such a situation, their future is not visible yet
 desh main sabase pehle zyada se zyada electric charging stesan banane honge tabhi jaakar electric gadiyon ko lekar desh main sahajata ban paaegi

 lihaaja apatkaal ke dauraan chartji apana passport hasil nahin kar sake
 But after the Emergency, when the Janata government was formed in the country after the defeat of Indira Gandhi's government, Somnath Da wanted to know the fate of his passport from the then foreign minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 to usee shaam somnath chatarji kaa naveenikrut kiya hua passport unhen mil gaya

 somnath da ne apatkaal se pehle apatkaal ke dauraan indira gandhi ke netritv vaali congress kii aalochana main koi kasar nahin chodi

 At the same time, while attacking the current Modi government at the Center, Hussomnath Chatterjee agreed with the opinion of senior BJP leader LK Advani that political enmity and reprisal has gone to a new level and it is unfortunate that the provision of Emergency is in the Constitution
 unka maananaa tha ki naagarik adhikaron ke nilamban or aadhikarik yaa anadhikarik rup se apatkaal lagaae jane kaa dar he, jo rajya or centre donon main ho saktaa he

 koun jaanata tha ki ye ladkaa bada hokar desh kaa chotii kaa vaigyanik banegaa, or raashtrapati pad kii shobhaa badhayega
 Kalam, the inspiration of crores of youth, used to mesmerize the crowd of thousands with his sweet tongue
 unhone do darjan kitaaben bhi likhin

 In which the handlers of Lashkar terrorists feel the status of AK-47 to recruit Hizbul militants at the behest of Pakistan
 saath hi iske liye aatankiyon ko acchhee dressing or geoup diya jaataa he, jisase wo "robin hud" kii tarah dikh saken
 By doing this, girls of Kashmir valley will be attracted by this fighter look 
 khufia reportse ye bhi khulaasa hua he ki ghati main maujuud hijbul or lashkar ke aatanki is maqasad main kaamyaab hone ke liye samay samay par apana video bhi jari karte rahete hai

 isse apane aapako gan or fiter luk ke saath dikhaakar ghati kii ladakiyon ko aakarshith karne kii yojana rahati he
 The revelations of the report make it clear that even the isi's plan G-square works behind the bank robbery and snatching of weapons of Hizbul and Lashkar terrorists
 yani bank lut se aaye paise se garlfrends ke liye mahange gift, mahange mobile or kapade kharid saken orek-47chhinane ke baad khinchvaai gai photo main apana luk robin hud jaisaa dikhaa saken

 There are 10 million abortions, which is a record and shockingly, 20,000 of these women die due to abortion related problems
 aise main goli khaakar garbhadhaaran kii samasya se nijaat paane kaa isse acha upaay kya ho saktaa he, kyonki asurakshit sahavaas ke baad 12 ghanton ke bheetar ise lene par isaki safalataa kii dar 95 fisadi he
 After this period, the manufacturers of these pills clearly state that it will not be effective for contraception
 ve yah bhi spasht karte hai ki ye apatkaaleen garbhanirodhak hai, or zyada mahatvapurn baat yah he ki ye goliyaan niyamit garbhanirodh jisamen anachaahe garbhadhaaran ko puri tarah roka jaataa he, kaa vikalp nahin hai
 Unfortunately, such messages do not reach the public properly in India, leading to increasing concern about the open sale of such emergency contraceptives in civilian organizations
 yah vivaad moulikta ko lekar uth rahaa he, kyonki kuch log in goliyon ke vigyapanon par aapatti jataa rahe hai, jinamein navayuvatiyon ko inaki vaastavik upabhokta ke taur par dikhaaya jaataa he
 As the Drug Controller of Tamil Nadu N
 selvaraju kehete hai, ''ham mahilaon ke adhikaron ke khilaaf nahin hai, lekin yah naitik chintaa kaa vishay he
 The advertisement of this drug will mean that women will think, 'I can do anything and this is the easy way to not get pregnant
 ' ham is tarah kii pravriti badhane kii ijaajat nahin de sakate
 The state drug control directorate even sent notices to a famous Tamil magazine for printing i-pill advertisements
 bharat main aise kai sanghathan hai jo isipi ke vigyapanon or isaki khuleam bikri kar roak lagaana chaahate hai
 The Women's Rights Organization in Chennai and the Directorate of Drug Controller of the Government of Tamil Nadu claim that advertisements of contraceptive pills violate the Drug and Magical Remedies Act, 1954
 is vajah se tamilnadu main aai-pil kii bikri ko roka ja rahaa he, haalanki bhartiya dawa maha niyantrak (disijii) kii ore se use hari jhandi mil chuki he
 On the other hand, some women's rights organizations have welcomed the ECP as a weapon of women's empowerment
 pune ke mahila adhikaar sanghathan 'stri' se judi rajshri gavde kahati hai, ''aisa nahin ki isipi aane ke baad yuva ladkiyaan sahavaas karne lageen, yah pehle bhi hota tha, jaisaa ki purv main garbhpaat ke aankade bayaan karte hai
 Now, due to ECP, there have been avenues for sex-active women in the society to avoid pregnancy
 yah balaatkaar kii shikaar mahilaon ke liye ek vardaan he
 Gawde hopes that such contraceptive pills will be available for sale openly
 unhen doctor kii parchon kii jarurat nahin padegi
 "explaining the reason for this, she says," Going to the doctor for a prescription would mean loss of precious time during the emergency
 '' yuva ladakiyon ke pareshaan abhibhavakon, kuch sanghathanon, rajya sarkaron or bhartiya vigyaapan parishad ke dabaav ke kaaran disijii ko isaki samiksha kerani padi he
 It is a relief to the supporters of ECP that DCGI has allowed their open sale
 uskaa kahana he ki aisa na karne se in goliyon kaa mul makasad hi khatm ho jayega
 These pills are openly available for sale in Russia, UK, USA, Canada and all Asian countries
 ye sirf madhya purv or dakshini america ke kuch hisson main dharmik aadhaar par pratibandhit hai
 However, the controversy over the ECP is not going to end soon
 haalanki zyaadaatar doctor is baat se sahamat hai ki isipi ek surakshit upaay he, bhale hi unka lambey samay tak istemaal kiya jaae
 But it is also true that there has not been much research on their misuse
 haalanki in goliyon kii nirmaataa companiyaan 'aapatkaal' shabd par jor detii hai, lekin bahut se doctoron kaa kahana he ki yuva mahilaayein, yahaan tak ki vivaahit mahilaayein, inkaa istemaal niyamit garbhanirodhak goliyon kii tarah karti hai
 "actually i have not read the 'what to do, what not to do' instructions of this medicine," says Bangalore-based copywriter Ragini Ravichander
 maine maheene main inhen do se zyada baar istemaal kiya he
 "in the printed material given by these pharmaceutical companies, it is instructed not to use ECP more than once in a cycle, but most people ignore these instructions
" alpakaaleen dushprabhav ke taur par ji machalanaa yaa kuch raktastrav kii shikaayat ho sakati he
 Says Ramani Rajaratnam, a Bangalore-based sociologist, "the problem is not about birth control pills or other ecps available in the market; the problem is about awareness
 ye goliyaan in chetavaniyon ke saath bechi jaani chahie ki ye goliyaan kya kar sakati hai or kya nahin kar sakati hai
 Swallowing the pills will not help
 purush or mahila donon ko inke parinaamon ke bare main jaananaa jaruri he
 '' Bali Clinic's Gynecologist Dr
 reeta bali kahati hai, ''bahut-si samasyaayein hai
 Their benefits far outweigh their losses
 yuva ladakiyon ko inkaa tabadatod istemaal na karne kii salaah di jaani chahie
 The nature of emergency use should be emphasized in advertisements
 ''salanaa kareeb 82 lakh goliyon kii bikri ko dekhte hue dawa companiyaan inkaa khub vigyaapan kar rahi hai, lekin unke durupyog ko rokane ke bare main paryaapt jaagrukta nahin paidaa kii ja rahi he
 Due to advertisements, people have come to know the fact that these pills prevent unwanted pregnancy, but the word emergency is not being emphasized
 sipla kii aai-pil bharat main sabase zyada bikne vaala brands he, jabaki duusare brandon main mainkind pharma kaa anwanted-72, joidas kaa isi2, vin medicare kaa naralevo or panchasheel argenix kaa i-pil hai
 a large section of doctors openly support their sale, although some doctors believe that they should be given on the advice of doctors
 lekin unhen rokane kaa yah bhi koi hal nahin he kyonki bharat main shedul-ech ke tahat doctoron kii salaah par milane vaali dawaaen bhi khuleam bikati hai
 Dr
 of Hyderabad rakesh malhotra, jo isipi ko surakshit maanate hai, kehete hai, ''ise doctoron kii salaah par di jane vaali dawa banane se dhokhadhadi hi badhegi, vakt barbaad hoga or nishchit rup se garbhpaat ke maamle badhenge
 According to gynecologist Bal Krishnan Badigar, "people should understand that an i-pill cannot be an alternative to regular contraception
 uske saath hi inkaa istemaal aapatkaal main hi karnaa chahie or ye goliyaan aids yaa duusare sankramak yon rogon se bachaav nahin kar sakati hai
 There is an urgent need to clearly publish the necessary instructions regarding these medicines
 saath hi inke dushprabhavon or vaidhanik chetavanee ke bare main bhi bataaya janaa chahie
 This will prevent their misuse
 aapane jab pehali baar muhabbat kii hogi, to wo aapke dil kii aawaaj bana hoga
 When your heart would be broken for the first time, its voice would have entertained you
 jab aap lambey safar par chale honge, to us aawaaj ne aapaki tanhai banti hogi

 "he said that after stressful chores, people enjoy our shows and laugh together

 " rashtriya swayan sevak sangh (aresas) ke sar sanghachaalak mohan bhagwat ne beete ravivaar ko jab dilli main pratiyogita pariksha par yojit sangh ke 'gyaan utsav' kaarykram ke samaapan bhaashan main 'aarakshan par sauhadrapurn maahaul main charchaa' kaa shigupha chhedaa to bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa purv vitt mantri arun jetali (ames main bhartee) ke saath bitaye samay ko yaad karne lage
 The synergy between Bhagwat's statement and Jaitley's point is that on such an occasion (statement on an untimely issue) Jaitley used to narrate the dialogue of the film mughal-e-azam in which Prithviraj Kapoor, who plays Akbar, says, "salim will not let you die and we will not let you Anarkali will not let me live! The Sangh has felt the need to discuss reservation, so the BJP does not have the chance to attack its ideological organization, but the party intelligently reiterates Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement that, 'reservation was, is' And will remain '
 haalanki sangh ne aarakshan ko samaapt karne yaa isaki samiksha kii baat nahin kii he, balki charchaa kii baat kahkar siyaasi bhuuchaal laa diya he
 Timing is also important
 sangh pramukh vibhinn kaaryakramon ke dauraan vibhinn muddon par apane vichaar rakhte hai lekin aarakshan jaise samvedansheel mudde par amuman sanyogvash aise samay baat nikal aati he jo bhaajapa ke liye mufeed nahin hota he
 This time too, the topic of reservation has been raised by the Sangh chief at a time when the entire BJP is patting its back on the removal of special status obtained under Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir and dividing it into two union territories Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh
 is master stroke se vipaksh khaskar congress bhi bant gai
 From the old to the new leaders of the party openly expressed their support
 yahi nahin, modi sarkaar isse pehle teen talaak ko gaiyr-kanoonee ghoshit karke sangh ke duusare agenda samaan naagarik samhita kii disha main thos kaam kar chuki he or ram mandir mudda jald sulajhane kii raah par chal padaa he
 In this way, the BJP has more or less fulfilled the agenda of the Sangh which has been supported by the Sangh
 ab sangh ke paas bhaajapa par dabaav banane kaa koi thos aadhaar nahin rah gaya he
 In such a situation, the question in the political corridor is under discussion whether the Sangh is looking for new issues to create pressure? Actually, these three issues have been such that the Sangh would pressurize the Vajpayee government of NDA-1 and Modi government of NDA-2
 Used to be
 lekin endie 3 (modi-2) sarkaar banane ke saath hi centre sarkaar ne sangh ko hamalavar hone kaa mauka hi nahin diya
 Within 100 days of taking oath, the Modi-2 government gave all the weapons that the Sangh had to attack the BJP
 sutron kaa kahana he ki modi-shah kii jodi ne anuchhed 370 hataane kii taiyaari ko lekar sangh se salaah lenaa to dur unhe bataane kii jarurat bhi nahin samajhi
 The way Sangh was suddenly surprised by this master stroke
 shaayad yah pehali baar hua jab sangh ke itane bade vaicharik mudde ko moort rup dene se pehle bhaajapa sarkaar ne usase vichaar-vimarsh tak nahin kiya
 Says a BJP leader, "when the Modi-1 government gave 10 per cent reservation to the poor, there was a voice from within the Sangh and the party that the bill for 10 per cent reservation was passed to the poor, the same readiness Article 370 Or why is there no Ram temple? But those who raise such questions within the party and the Sangh have now lost that opportunity to put pressure on the government
 aise main apni ahmiyat jataane ke liye aarakshan kaa mudda uthanaa swabhaavik he
 However, Bhagwat has not raised the issue of reservation for the first time
 unhone 2015 main bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke samay bhi aarakshan kaa mudda uthaaya tha
 At that time, the Sangh had all the issues including Article 370 through which it could surround the Central Government
 isliye aaj yah kahana kitna munasib he ki ahmiyat jataane ke liye aarakshan raag chhedaa ja rahaa he? bhaajapa netaa kehete hai, ''bihar chunaav ke dauraan bhagwat ke bayaan par jab vipaksh ne sawaal uthaae to sangh kii taraf se kaha gaya ki, jab tak bhedbhaav he tab tak aarakshan jaruri he
 However, it is like an attack with a double-edged sword
 sangh ke bayaan ko aksharsh: liya jaae to bhaajapa jab tak aarakshan kaa samarthan karti rahegi, uskaa matlab he ki desh main asamanta kaa mahaul he
 If the BJP claims that there are opportunities for equality in the country or if there is a gap of inequality, then the issue of review on reservation can arise from the Sangh
 aise main sangh yah dabaav banane kii koshish kar saktaa he ki samvidhan main aarakshan kii vyavastha sthaayee nahin he to phir ise kab tak lagu rakhaa jayega
 Just as the BJP is justifying the removal of Article 370 as a temporary provision, on the basis of the same argument, the Sangh can show the mirror to the BJP that reservation is a temporary provision, so why not review it as well
 agar nahin to sarkaar yah maane kii desh main asamanta baari he
 Both these things can give the Sangh an opportunity through which it can try to push the BJP on the backfoot
 baharhaal, bhaajapa ke andar is bayaan ko adhik tavajjo nahin di ja rahi he
 The party's stand on reservation is clear that the BJP supports reservation and does not consider the need for any review or discussion
 lekin sangh pramukh ne jo bayaan diya he, vah anayas nahin ho saktaa he
 The Sangh chief has also said that the government, BJP and the union are different
 teenon kii alag pahchaan he
 It is true that many people of the Sangh are in the party and party-led government
 ve sangh kii baat sunate hai lekin yah aavashyak nahin ki ve sangh kii baat se sahamat hi hon, ve asahmat bhi ho sakate hai
 That is, the statement of the Sangh chief is that "those who are advocates of reservation in an amicable atmosphere, listen to those who oppose reservation and those who are opposed to reservation, listen to those who support reservation, then resolve the matter in a minute
" Will be in '' sangh ke akhil bhartiya prachaar pramukh arun kumaar, bhagwat ke bayaan ko khaarij nahin karte hai
 According to Arun Kumar, Sir Sanghchalak called for "to express the importance of resolving sensitive questions like reservation, stating the importance of resolving all questions on the basis of good-faith interaction in society"
 bhaashan ke ek hisse par anaavashyak vivaad khadaa karne kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 "the clarification was given by the Sangh, but this statement of Bhagwat has definitely given the opposition parties a chance to attack the BJP
" congress ke media vibhaag ke pramukh randeep singh surajevaala kehete hai, ''bhagwat kii tippanee ne aresas or bhaajapa kaa dalit virdohi cheharaa benakaab kar diya he
 "congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi has said in a tweet that," The RSS is upbeat and the plan is dangerous
 jis samay bhaajapa sarkaar ek-ek karke janapakshdhar kanoonon kaa galaa ghont rahi he aresas ne bhi lage haath aarakshan par bahes karne kii baat uthaa di he
 BSP chief Mayawati has also tweeted that Bhagwat's statement has created a dangerous skepticism in the SC / SC and OBC category
 bhagwat ke bayaan se vipakshi dalon ko jane-anjaane ek hathiyaar mil gaya he
 Assembly elections are to be held in bjp-ruled states like Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand by the end of the year
 vipakshi dal chunaav main is mudde ko uthaa sakate hai
 Therefore, questions are being raised about the timing of Bhagwat's statement in the BJP
 vaise, sangh pramukh aarakshan par charchaa kii vakaalat karte hai or isaki jarurat bhi bataate hai
 But who will start the discussion and how
 bhaajapa siyaasi vajahon se charchaa chaahati nahin he
 Any contingent organization of the Sangh taking a seminar or lecture and initiating a discussion (after the bjp's big win in 2019) is unlikely
 aise main charchaa jaahir rup se vipakshi kheme se shuru hogi
 Perhaps in view of this, the Sangh chief has said this
 chunaav hi vah samay ho saktaa he jab sangh kii ore se samaan naagarik samhita ko lekar yah prashn bhi uthaaya jaae ki jab goa jaise rajya main varshon se samaan naagarik samhita he to phir bhaajapa shasit rajyon main ise lagu karne kii charchaa to honi hi chahie
 This agenda of the Sangh will create a platform on which to consider discussions with the unbeatable bjp-sangh in a cordial atmosphere
 sangh kii mushkilbhajapa ke badhate aakaar se sangh kaa us par pakad banaae rakhana kathinsamaj ke har tabake main sangh ke samanaantar bhaajapa kaa cader ban janadhara 370 ke baad ayodhya bhi sulajhane kii kagaar par, sangh ke paas vaicharik mudda viheen hone kaa khatraasang par bhaajapa kii nirbharta kam hote janasarkaar or sanghathan main sanghaki pasandida ko tawvajo nahin
 The first day of Bigg Boss 11 witnessed witness to the quarrels of the contestants, and on the second day the sword of nomination hung over them
 duusare din is sijan kaa pehla nomination hona tha
 All members of the household had to take two names for nomination
 sabase zyada vot shilpa scindia ke naam rahe
 Shilpa got six votes in the nomination
 nomination ke liye sabase zyada vot paane ke baad shilpa chaunk gayi or unke aansu chhalakane lage
 Shilpa had no hope that her name would be the first to be nominated for the elimination round
 shilpa ke baad jubair, hina or jyoti ko sabase zyada vot mili
 But where does anything happen so directly in Bigg Boss house? In this nomination too, Bigg Boss imposed a twist with neighbors
 darasal padosiyon ko kisi ek nominated sadasyon ko bachaane or do ko nominete karne kii takat di gai he
 Due to this instruction from Bigg Boss, the neighbors protected Hina Khan
