 Three children have escaped from the State Children's Home (kishore) of Surajkund in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh

 Announcing the award, the Nobel Prize Committee also spoke specifically of John Muelbure and Ditton's 1980 research paper 'an Almost Ideal Demand System'
 research paper main samaaj main maang ke dhaanche kii ek vishwasaneey tasviir pesh kii gai he
 At a news conference in Princeton on Monday, Ditton also talked about the world's phenomenal progress
 diton ne kaha, "pichley 220 varshon main duniya main kaaphi badlaav hua he or hamamen se kaaphi logon kii jindagi pehle se sampann ho gai he or hamaari tarakkee ke maarg prashast ho gaye hai
 But much more remains to be done about this
 " Ditton said, "the world has changed a lot in the last 220 years and a lot of us have already completed our lives and paved the way for our progress
 lekin is bare main abhi bahut kuch kiya janaa baaki he
 " aane vaale dinon main daal kii keemten or kam hone ja rahi hai or aam taur par sabase mahangi bikne vaali tuur yani arhar kii daal kii keemat girakar 50 rupe prati kilo par pahunch jaaegi
 But this good news for the people has become a big problem for the Modi government
 daal kii keemton kaa kabhi aasmaan choona or kabhi bilkul gir janaa kendra sarkaar ke liye aisi musiibat ban gayi he jisase nipatane main sarkaar ko paseene chhot rahe hai
 At this time the challenge before the government is that the prices of pulses have already gone down in the market and toor 75 kg is being sold in the cities
 lekin sarkaar ke paas 18 lakh ton daal kaa stock padaa he jise agar jaldi se jaldi nahin khapaaya gaya to ye kharaab ho jayega
 Lentils cannot be stored for more than a year and a half
 isliye sarkaar kii majaburi he ki wo daal ko jald se store se nikaal kar bazaar main utaare or rajya sarkaron ko baante
 On the other hand, pulses of kharif crop will come in the markets in a few days and more pulses will be filled in the government godowns
 sarkari godaam bhale hi bhare kyon na hon lekin nunatam samarthan mulya par daal khareednaa sarkaar kii majaburi he
 The method of consuming pulses stock has been decided
 chaar lakh ton daal sarkari godaamon se nikaal kar khule bazaar main bechaa jayega
 Three and a half million tonnes of pulses will be given to the states of South India and Gujarat which will be distributed in ration shops
 iske alaava puraani daal ko godaam se nikaal kar khapaane ke liye sarkaar 2 lakh ton daal alag-alag sarkari vibhaagon ko degi
 Now the problem is that when the pulses of government warehouses come in the market, the prices will be reduced further
 kendra sarkaar ke liye kisaanon kii daal khareednaa ghate kaa sauda ho gaya he kyonki kai jagahon par bazaar main daal kii keemten nunatam samarthan mulya se bhi kam ho chuki hai
 In order to consume the pulses of the godowns, the central government will have to sell the pulses at a loss
 sirf do saal pehle tuur daal kii keemat 200 rupe prati kilo tak pahunch gayi thi
 Then there was so much uproar about this that the government had to import pulses from all over the world to bring down the price of pulses
 myanmar se lekar africa tak se daal mangai gai
 In order to control the prices of pulses, the government decided to create a buffer stock of import of 2 million tonnes of pulses to control the situation further
 lekin iske baad pichley saal daal kii banpar paidaavaar hui
 Seeing the skyrocketing prices of pulses, farmers across India planted a lot of pulses
 nateeja yah hua ki daal kii paidaavaar record tod hui or pehali baar aisa hua kii daal ke liye videsh se aayaat par nirbhar bharat main aayaat puri tarah se rokna padaa
 Not only this, some pulses had to be exported
 sarkaar ke liye ab daal ke 20 lakh ton kabfer stock bananaa baripad rahaa he
 Now the prices of pulses are going down, if the government removes more pulses in the market, then the prices will go down further
 keemten agar bahut kam ho gai to daal ugane vaale kisaan behaal ho jaaenge or agle saal ke liye daal kii buvaai kam karenge
 But if the lentils do not come out of the godown, then it will be spoiled
 hisaab kuch is tarah se gadabad he ki aamtaur par sabase mahangi bikne vaali arhar daal sasti ho gai he or sabase sasti rahane vaali chane daal kii keemat arhar se bhi zyada ho gai he
 The reason for this is that this time arhar has been produced more than gram
 kul milakar baat yah he kii daal kii supplai or maang main talmail bithaana modi sarkaar ke liye badi chunauti sabit ho rahaa he
 The rich or super rich of other emerging economies including India prefer to buy their second home abroad

 In the Lok Sabha elections, RLD could not win a single seat in UP
 iske baavjood kshetra main ajit singh kaa asar puri tarah se nakaara nahin ja saktaa
 It is believed that Ajit's support to any party can play a decisive role in the event of a close contest in the UP Assembly elections (which is very likely)
 samaajawaadee party ke ek netaa ne kaha, 'espi ke samarthan se ralod siten jeet sakati he

 Actually Ajit's track record has forced him to take such a position
 ajit singh centre main bijepi ke netritv vaali endie or congress ke netritv vaali upie sarkaar main mantri rah chuke hai

 Ajit Singh's party currently has only 9 mlas in the 403-member UP Legislative Assembly, while he does not have a single MP in Parliament
 tippaniyan Leaders of the Rashtriya Lok Dal said that his party was in a decisive role in 60 assembly seats in 12 districts of Jat-dominated UP
 kareeb ek dashak pehle apane pita or purv pradhanmantri choudhary charan singh kii chhavi ke kaaran ajit singh kii party kaa upi ke jaaton par acha khaasaa asar tha
 But due to the demise of 'chaudhary Saheb' and the weak performance of this party in the 2014 General Election, the situation is no longer the same
 loksabhaa chunaav main ralod upi main ek bhi seat nahin jeet paaya tha
 Despite this, Ajit Singh's influence in the region cannot be completely ruled out
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki upi vidhansabha chunaav main najdiki mukaable kii sthiti main (jisaki puri sambhaavna he) kisi bhi party ko ajit kaa samarthan nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he
 a Samajwadi Party leader said, `` RLD can win seats with the support of SP

 ) Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) youth leader and former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav says that no decision has been taken to make former JNU president Kanhaiya Kumar a candidate
 left se baatcheet ke baad is sambandh main faisla liya jayega
 However, RJD is not in favor of making Kanhaiya Kumar a candidate
 iske kai kaarnon main se ek tark yah bhi he ki kanhaiya kumaar begusarai se chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai or argedy kaa maananaa he ki vahaan unase majboot ummidavaar unke paas he
 Kanhaiya Kumar's politics, which was discussed in the JNU sedition case, should not end anywhere while the chargesheet was done in this case

 There is no thought about this issue yet
 jeenyu main 2016 main desh virdohi naare lagane ke aaropee kanhaiya kumaar ke khilaaf chargeshit isi saal 14 janvari ko daakhil ho gai he
 However, before this, whenever Kanhaiya was asked questions about his anti-national slogans, his answer was that if this is true then why does the police not file the charge sheet
 ab jabaki is maamle main chargeshit daakhil ho gai he to kanhaiya ke liye jawaab dena mushkil hoga
 The Mahagathbandhan does not want that they have to answer such questions which will benefit the BJP
 sipiai abhi kanhaiya kumaar ke tikat kii daavedaari ko lekar chup he, lekin janata dal you (jediu) kaa kahana he ki bhrashtrachaar maamle main sajayaftaa lalu prasad yadav jail main rah kar tikat baant sakate hai to kanhaiya kumaar ko bhi tikat mil hi jayega
 JDU spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan said, "look at such questions in the Grand Alliance, i don't think there is a big problem, so Lalu Prasad, the leader of the largest party of the Grand Alliance, is decorated and there are taking every major decision of the party
" gathbandhan ke bade faisle vahi le rahe hai to kanhaiya kumaar ke khilaaf to abhi keval chargeshit daakhil hui he
 Kanhaiya Kumar has very serious allegations that if any political party advocates him in cases like treason, then somewhere he is playing with the public sentiments of the country, but about the grand alliance, i can say that he is making such a decision
 Can take them because they have a whole army of convicted and tainted leaders
 'vaise, kanhaiya kumaar ko mahagathbandhan main ek ubharate hue netaa ke rup main dekha ja rahaa tha or isse tejasvi yadav ko pratidwandita jheli pad sakati thi or argedy yaa lalu prasad yadav pehle se hi aisa nahin chaahate the
 Now that the chargesheet has been imposed on Kanhaiya in the case of treason, then surely his ticket can be cut, ie the incident that caused him to become a ticket holder could also result in betrothal

 When Ravish Kumar of NDTV, who arrived in Manila to receive the Ramon Magsaysay Award, was asked a question that he has not been congratulated by PM Modi yet, he said to this, no matter PM Modi did not congratulate him
 unka badhai nahin dena bhi badhai he
 'let me tell you that Ravish Kumar will be awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award on 9 September
 is sammaan ko paane vaale raveesh kumaar hindi media ke pehle patrkaar hai
 Ravish Kumar has arrived from Manila, Philippines for this honor
 ramon magsese ke manch se unhone bhaashan bhi diya
 Ravish Kumar said in his speech, "citizenship requires freedom of information and authenticity
 aaj state kaa media or uske bijnes par puraa control ho chukaa he
 Media control means that the scope of your citizenship is reduced
 media ab sarvelans state kaa part he
 He is no longer a Fourth Estate, but a First Estate
 privet media or garvanment media kaa antar mit gaya he
 Its job is not to diversify, but to control
 aisa bharat sahit duniya ke kai deshon main ho rahaa he
 He said, "this is the same media that started to fabricate 'citizen Journalism' to cut down on their expenses
" iske zariye media ne apane risk ko outsource kar diya
 Citizen journalism within mainstream media and citizen journalism outside mainstream media are both different things, but when people started questioning in the early stages of social media, the same media turned against social media
 newzaroom ke bheetar blog or website band kiye jane lage
 Even today, journalists are not allowed to write personal opinion in many newsrooms

 These days, one thing has suddenly come out of the page of Ayurveda and has entered the tongue of common people
 dilli main chunaav or iske nateezon ke bich jitani baar kiran bedi kii charchaa hui, usase kahin zyada baar logon ne 'mulethi' or iske 'sambhavit' asar ko yaad kiya
 Actually, Kiran Bedi appeared with a glass filled with hot water during an interview
 poochne par unhone kaha ki zyada bhaashan dene kii vajah se unka galaa in dinon zyada suukhta he, isliye ve garm pani piti hai
 When she was advised to consume liquorice, she said that she keeps liquorice
 public ko jab tak kiran bedi kii baaki baaten hajam hotin, usase pehle hi mulethi apana 'asar' dikhalaa chuki thi
 Many political 'gopodhankshas' said that if the BJP candidates had as much penetration in Delhi as they did in Mulethi, the results would have been different
 
 
 baharhaal, mulethi jab charchaa main he, to sehat par iske asar par gaur farmana bhi lajimi hi he
 What is Mulethi: Mulethi is a beneficial plant, which is used in the treatment of many diseases
 iskaa paudha kareeb 6 foot tak lanbaa hota he
 It looks brown from outside, but yellow from inside
 ek baar jameen se ukhaad lene ke baad kareeb 2 saal tak dawa ke taur par iskaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 According to Ayurveda, Mulethi calms the three doshas - Vata, Kapha and Pitta due to their unsurpassed qualities
 iskaa ek naam 'yashtimadhu' bhi he
 It has got its name because it is sweet in taste
 mulethi ke phaaydon kaa bakhaan ayurveda se jude granthon main kiya gaya he
 Its 10 benefits are discussed here
 
 
 1
 To cure a sore throat immediately, liquorice proves very helpful
 munh baar-baar sookhne kii sthiti main bhi mulethi se phayda hota he
 2
 sukhi khaansee main bhi mulethi laabh pahunchaati he
 Consuming it with black pepper reduces phlegm and provides relief
 3
 Mulethi also cures some diseases of women
 yah saundarya main badhotaree karti he
 Obesity is also overcome by its use
 4
 It has antibacterial potential
 pet ke ulcer or ghaav thik karne main mulethi kii jad behad kargar sabit hoti he
 5
 pachan kriya thik karne main bhi mulethi kaa koi jod nahin he
 In indigestion, chaos, dysentery, hyper acidity, etc
, liquorice shows immediate effect
 6
 It is also used as a medicine in the treatment of epilepsy
 7
 It is believed that by consuming liquorice as a rule, the voice is melodious
 8
 Mulethi is also used for the health and beauty of the eyes
 9
 Although liquorice is sweeter than sugar, but it is also used in diabetes disease
 10
 It is also used in betel leaf
 ek naseehat
 When someone insists on eating liquorice, refusing it can prove harmful
 
 
 bihar ke mukhyamantri or janata dal united ke rashtriya adhyaksh nitish kumaar ne loksabhaa chunaav main bihar ke nateezon par kaha he ki yah jeet bihar ke logon kii jeet he koi maanegaa ki unki jeet he to bhram he
 Nitish said this while talking to media persons at the airport on reaching Patna
 nitish ke is kathan kaa yahi arth lagaaya ja rahaa hai ki unhone bijepi ke dilli se lekar patna tak ke netaaon ko ishaare-ishaare main ye kaha he ki bihar main jo untalis seat endie ko mili hai, wo bihar main jo unka janadhaar he uske kaaran mila hai naa ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kaaran
 Nitish said that should be known during the election and people have seen which class of people were voting in the harsh sunlight
 nitish kaa ishaara nishchit rup se atipichdi jati ke taraf hogi jinhone endie ke liye jamkar matdaan kiya he
 After returning from Delhi, Nitish gave his clarification on two issues
 ek mantrimandal main unki koi sankhya par koi charchaa nahin hui
 He had only demanded that the BJP give numbers to its allies on a proportionate basis, but admitted that the BJP was not interested in any symbolic representation on the subject due to the overwhelming majority
 unhone saafe kiya ki bhavishya main bhi janata dal united kaa modi cabinet main koi pratinidhitiv hone kaa koi sambhaavna nahin kyonki iskaa ek galat raajnneetik arth lagaaya jayega

 vahiin par party kaa naam, jhanda or nishaan tay hoga
 'why are you angry Jogi?' Ajit Jogi expressed displeasure over the attitude of the Congress high command, saying that the party was no longer the Nehru, Indira, Rajiv and Sonia Gandhiwali Congress
 is baat se unka sidhaa nishaanaa rahul gandhi kii ore tha, haalanki unhone rahul gandhi kaa naam nahin liya

 It is like a bonus
 lekin main 100 karod rupee ke club ko mahatv detii hum

 anna hajaare kii jeet ko congress party kii bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jeet bataate huye kendriya mantri shriprakash jaiswal ne kaha ki congress party chaahati thi ki kathor lokapal bill laayaa jaye
 Now that Anna has made the public aware against corruption in the country and has filled a new consciousness in it, then it will be easy for the Congress to pass this bill in Parliament
 kendriya koyala mantri shriprakash jaiswal ne ek vishesh baatcheet main kaha ki anna hajaare ne bhrashtachar ke khilaaf andolan kar desh kii janata main ek nayi jaagrukta bhar usamen ek nayi chetana bhar di he
 The Congress party was also against corruption and wanted to bring the toughest Lokpal bill, but it was afraid that if this bill becomes too harsh then it will be opposed in Parliament and other political parties will not allow it to be passed
 unhone kaha ki anna hajaare ne lokapal bill ke liye aamaran anshan kar or desh kii karodon janata ko apane saath jod kar congress party adhyaksh sonia gandhi or pradhanmantri manmohan singh kaa kaam aasaan kar diya
 For this reason, the initiative of Congress President Sonia Gandhi worked quickly and immediately a committee was formed
 jaiswal ne kaha ki ek tarah se dekhen, to anna ke andolan ne congress party kaa kathor lokapal bill laane kaa kaam aasaan kar diya or sansad ke monasutra satr main is bill ko paas karaane main jo bhi raajnneetik dal iskaa virodh karenge vah janata ke saamne benakaab ho jaayenge
 Describing the unity of the people against corruption in the country as a good step for democracy by Anna's movement, Union Minister Jaiswal said that now the Congress Party will work on this bill as soon as possible and present it in the upcoming monsoon session of Lok Sabha and which Even political parties will oppose it, the reality will be revealed in front of their people
 unhone kaha ki tab janata jaan jaayengi ki koun sa dal bhrashtachar ke khilaaf he or kathor kadam uthaakar desh se bhrashtachar samaapt karnaa chahta he or koun sa dal lokapal bill kaa virodh kar bhrashtachar ko gupachup samarthan kar rahaa he
 When Jaiswal was told that the Bharatiya Janata Party had already announced that she would not oppose this Lokpal bill, she said that it was her compulsion to make such a declaration, if she had not done so, she would not have been exposed to the public
 unhone kaha ki bhrashtachar ab ek rashtriya mudda ban gaya he
 The crores of rupees that the central government runs for the development of the states, when reaching the general public, only 20 percent is left
 aakhir yah baaki paisa jaataa kahaan he? ab is lokapal bill ke aa jane se keval bhrasht mantri hi nahi fansenge, balki adhikari bhi isaki chapet main aane se batch nahi paayenge
 They say that not only corrupt ministers are afraid of Anna's movement, but corrupt officials are also in awe
 yah poochne par ki kya isse desh main bhrashtachar puri tarah se khatm ho jayega to iske jawaab main jaiwaal ne kaha ki nahin, puri tarah se nahin to thodaa bahut to kam hoga hi
 This kind of fear filled the minds of corrupt people with this voice and solidarity of the people
 kendriya mantri jaiswal ne kaha ki anna ne desh main jo bhrashtachar ke khilaaf maahaul banaaya he vah aise hi bana rahe, taaki congress party ke bhrashtachar ke khilaaf muhim main kinhin kaarnon se jo haath bandhe the vah haath khule rah saken or party desh se bhrashtachar mitaane ke liye kade kadam uthaa saken
 He said that Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh themselves want to eradicate this corruption-related disease from the country and now that they have got the right environment, then the party will take some tough steps so that corruption on the country is very correct
 But it can be controlled
 unase poocha gaya ki aaj log anna kii tulana mahatma gandhi se kar rahe hai, to unhone kaha ki kisi bhi mahapurush kii tulana kisi duusare mahapurush se nahin kii ja sakati he
 While Gandhi had launched a movement to drive the British out of the country, Anna has agitated to remove corruption
 anna ke is janandolan se ab bhrasht mantriyon or adhikariyon ke man main thodaa dar jarur baithegaa or yahi dar desh kii tarakkee ke liye bahut bada kaam he

 Nitish Kumar wants that if a grand alliance is formed before the Uttar Pradesh elections, then Akhilesh Yadav must be included in it

 darasal conot place ke inner cirkil ko payalat project ke tahat agle teen maheene ke liye whical free jone banane kii endiemasi kii yojana nai dilli treders association ko raas nahin aa rahi he

 Due to the beautification of CP, there will be fountains and beautiful lighting in the parking place
 seepi ke andar se hokar guzarane vaali gadiyon ko outer cirkil se hokar guzarana hoga
 All vehicles entry in CP will be from Janpath
 baba kharag singh maarg se agsit hoga

 The balcony of that bungalow behind the Hanuman temple near Connaught Place was somewhat different
 jaise hiaam aadmi partikoi vidhansabha seat jitati or netaa balakani se iskaa elaan karte, neeche samarthakon main jabardast josh aa jaataa tha
 The novice Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), led by Arvind Kejriwal, finally secured 28 seats and 29 per cent votes, not only ousting the Congress which has been ruling in Delhi for 15 years but also the main opposition party BJP at the very mouth of power Stuck tab se rajnatik paridrishy main naatakeey badlaav aa chukaa he
 AAP held power in Delhi for 49 days
 uske baad lanbaa samay raashtrapati shashan kaa rahaa
 During this, Narendra Modi's BJP took power at the center and also won all the seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi
 ab yah mahanagar-rajya 7 farvari ko vidhansabha chunaavon ke agle daur ke liye taiyaar ho rahaa he
 In such a situation, there remains one thing - Kejriwal is still a big force
 yah baat na sirf kai saare surveykshanon se jaahir hoti he jinamein ve mukhyamantri pad ke liye pehali pasand banakar lagaataar ubhar rahe hai, balki yah hakeekat is baat se bhi saamne aati he ki khud pradhanmantri modi ne 10 janvari ko ramlila maidan kii raily main unhen bijepi ke sabase pramukh pratidwandvi kii haisiyat se nawaja
 In the general elections, BJP had an edge in 60 out of 70 assembly constituencies in Delhi
 halaat ko palatney ke liye kejariwal aap ko uski enjio / activist jadon se pare le jaakar ek majboot dhaanche vaali party main tabdeel kar rahe hai
 What is Kejriwal's advantage? Kejriwal has also captured a trick of Modi's Lok Sabha election campaign
 party ke ranneetikaron kaa kahana he ki kejariwal ne ramlila maidan main modi kii raily se pehle hi dilli main 50 vidhansabha-str kii jansabhaon ko sambodhit kar liya tha
 Kejriwal also has the advantage that while Modi can only hold large gatherings due to the security cover, Kejriwal is available in the street
 aap ke varisht netaa aisi jansabhaon ko lagbhag rojaanaa sambodhit kar rahe hai
 Party sources say that they aim to hold 8-10 public meetings in every assembly constituency by the day of polling
 aap ke varisht netaa yogendra yadav kehete hai, 'anya rajyon main bijepi kaa saamana dhoomil chhavi vaali tatkaaleen sarkaron se tha or saamne koi lokapriy cheharaa nahin tha, lekin dilli main yah sthiti nahin he
 Voluntary cooperation and activism in social media are being used to support aap's new structural strength
 aap ke liye ateet main bhi yah phydemand rahaa he
 Party sources say that they expect five to ten thousand activists from across the country to gather in Delhi for campaigning
 yah sankhya main bhale hi usase kam ho jo 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke vakt party ne juta liye the, lekin is baar ve chunavi prakriya se zyada behatar waakif honge
 These activists are already giving a big boost to aap's social media campaign so that an atmosphere can be created and at the same time they are taking full help of street plays and flash mob campaigns
 party ne bijepi ko chakma dete hue samoochee dilli main khaas najar aane vaali 80 jagahon par kejariwal ke hording taan die
 Despite its low billboards, aap's presence looks like BJP
 kejariwal ne party ke chunaav abhiyaan ke liye mumbai, bangaluru or dubai main sansaadhan jutaney vaale bahu-prachaarit kaarykram yojit kiye
 But at the same time, resource mobilization programs are going on at the assembly level
 is koshish se na keval paisa jutegaa balki us madhya varg kaa samarthan bhi milegaa jiske bare main yah kaha ja rahaa tha ki vah aap se chhitak kar dur chalaa gaya he
 Kejriwal has already participated in 13 such programs
 haalanki madhya varg ko lekar anischitata yakeenan party ko thodaa pareshaan kiye hue he lekin use yah ummid bhi he ki congress ke prati ghatata utsaah aap ko musalamaanon ke bhi zyaadaatar vot dilaa degaa
 The party is also working on weak aspects that emerged in 2013, such as rural outer Delhi where it won only one of the 12 seats
 vah jansabhaayen yojit karke bhoomi adhigrahan par centre sarkaar ke adhyadesh kaa virodh kar rahi he
 The AAP has re-nominated 21 of its mlas but in the rest of the seats, it is mainly dependent on those who were assigned different assembly segments to form the party organization soon after the general elections
 party ne 48 pratyaashee unheen main se chune hai
 Apart from this, the party has also given tickets to four activists

 In a Tajavideo, the policemen in Indore are holding a meeting with some people in the middle of the road and beating them with sticks in between
 indore ke diaiji harinarayan chaari mishra or madhya pradesh ke dijipi rishi kumaar shukla ne video kii jaankaree hone se inkaar kar diya he
 On being told about the incident, the DGP has told 'aaj Tak' that they will talk to their officer
 police acha kaam kar rahi- diijimedia report ke mutabik, diaiji harinarayan ke aadesh par hi police aisi karrwai kar rahi he
 In the conversation till date, the DIG denied knowing of the beating of the accused, but it definitely said- 'they are aware of the mass arrest of the accused
 hamaari police acha kaam kar rahi he
 This 'collective action' campaign has been ongoing
 'ek anya sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki police ko uthak-baithak nahin karana chahie
 The media has described the action as a 'procession of criminals'
 isse jude ek sawaal par diaiji ne kaha ki ve ise juluus kii jagah police kii samuhik karrwai kahana adhik pasand karenge
 Continuing such action, the DIG himself has admitted that such action is going on for about a month
 isamen kai thanon kii police ek saath aparaadhiyon ko pakadati he
 The accused can then be driven into the street and shown to be punished
 chunki bhartiya kanoon main police ko kisi bhi aaropee ko sajaa dene kaa adhikaar hasil nahin he
 But these incidents in the series and silence of high officials raise these questions on the law and order of the state
 
 
 1
 In which cases can the police of Madhya Pradesh beat the accused by standing on the road? 2
 kya bheed ko khush karne athwa lokapriy hone ke liye police ko aisi karrwai karne kii chhot di gai he?3
 Is it a serious illegal case for the police to beat or punish the accused on the street? 4
 neshnal tivi channel par video chalaae jane ke baavjood shahar ke jimmedaar adhikari ke paas 'ghatana kii jaankaree nahin he
 'should there be an inquiry against them? 5
 chunki aisi ghatnaayen baar-baar ho rahi hai, ye kyon na mana jaae ki sarkaar or ucch adhikari, aisi karrwai kaa maun samarthan kar rahe hai?6
 Does Madhya Pradesh run by any other law instead of 'indian Penal Code'? 7
 kya bhavishya main sarkaar koi aisa kanoon banane par vichaar kar rahi he jisamen police kuch maamalon main khud kii sajaa tay de?8
 Does Madhya Pradesh Police want to save the court time by punishing itself in some cases? 9
 kya dijipi ko ise gambhir maamla maanate hue turant karrwai kaa kam se kam aashwaasan nahin dena chahie?10
 Are high officials beating the criminals and giving silent support to them, are not participating in the 'procession of the law'? congress kii antarim adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne shanivaar ko maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main ummidavaaron par nirnay ke liye yahaan party kii chunaav samiti kii baithak kii adhyakshata kii
 However, the notice of absence of former party president Rahul Gandhi was more noticed in the meeting
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main rahul gandhi ke karyaalay ne kaha ki vah baithak main shaamil nahin hue, kyonki rahul chunaav samiti ke sadsy nahin hai
 Even before this, Rahul Gandhi has not attended many meetings of the party

 karnataka chunaav ke dauraan gandhi ne kaha tha ki vah karnataka chunaav ke baad kailash maanasarowar yatra par jaaenge

 sahityaakademisales@vsnl
 net rains mavra ghar hai is the first poetry collection of young poet Kumar Anupam, which has come under the Navodaya Yojana of Sahitya Akademi
 sangrah kii kavitaayen padhate hue ek aise sambhaavnashil kavi kii tasviir jehan main aati he jo jivan main puri tarah rachaa-basaa he
 The tone of Kumar Anupam's poem is quite different from the rhetoric and news statements that have come in the name of young poetry in recent times
 yah swar bahut dhimaa he, kam bolta he or lagbhag aatmasanshay kii had tak sankoch kaa shikaar he
 And perhaps this is the greatest beauty of his poetry in this tumultuous time
 sangrah kii pehali hi kavita he tees kii umr main jivan-prasang
 It is a poem of pain of an unemployed young man
 dhyaan den-ankhon tale umr or samay kaa jhutputa ghir aayaa he / lekin safar kaa bharosa / kaayam he mere kadamon or drushti par abhi
 Again 
 
 
 neenden kam hone lagi hai raaton ke banisbat / kintu offis jane kii koshishen subah / aksar safal ho hi jaati hai
 Ultimately, this entire poem is a painful story of a dying man of thirty years
 ajeeb baat he ki kumaar anupam ne aaj tak shaayad koi kahani nahin likhi, lekin unki kavitaaon main kahaniyaan khub hai
 Kinku Maharaj is an epic epic tale
 is kavita ko padhate hue achaanak aapkaav mangalvsh dabraal or bodhisattva kii kavita pagaldas kii yaad aati he
 Both Pagal Das and Kinku Maharaj poems are expressive poems stemming from the agony of the Babri Masjid demolition, but Kumar Anupam's poem transcends both earlier poems and for the first time encounters religion and leftism
 kavita main kinaku maharaj kehete hai-babu, tum to kamanisht nahin samajhoge yah bhed / magar ganth baandh lo yah sutara / ki kamanisht raho to raho / kam-nishth nahin hona kabhi / yahi adharm he
 
 
 This poem is a major commentary on the communal storm that erupted in the country since 1992
 haalanki sangrah main danga jaisi kavitaayen bhi hai jo shuddh bayaan jaisi lag sakati hai
 a poem is the office system
 isamen ve likhte hai ki vah naukari karata tha or chakri tak karanv ko taiyaar tha
 Anupam has a unique poetic vision
 ladakiyon, maa or pita par idhar nakli kavitaaon kii baadh ai hui he lekin anupam kii kavita ladkiyaan hans rahi hai kii ye panktiyaan dekhie-ladkiyaan hans rahi hai / ki khul-khul padate hai bajuband / paayal nadi hui ja rahi he / 
 
 
 Wait / hearthware / needle-thread / stop in response to a discourse / let them laugh
 sangrah main unki ek lambii kavita he-videshini
 The opening lines of the poem are - You speak / So a language speaks / And when / You speak / In my language / a new language is born
 prem kaa yah ek adbhut ehsaas he jo yahaan ek anokhi bhashaa main vyakt hua he
 This language is actually the 'language of the middle' which develops slowly
 bengal, samudr, baaluu or registan par bhi sangrah main kuch behtareen kavitaayen hai
 Similarly, they write about the city - the city in which the veins do not flow / no river / that city / has no relation with the heart
 apane pehle hi sangrah se anupam ne bhavishya kii ek badi sambhaavna kaa sanket diya he

 mumbai ke vankhede stadium main mumbai indiens or rajasthan royles ke bich hua ipel kaa aakhri lig muqabla toornament kaa sabase romaanchak match sabit hua
 In a dramatic way, Mumbai Indians qualified for the play-offs by defeating Rajasthan Royals by 5 wickets
 naatakeey andaaj main jitrajasthan royles ne pehle khelte hue 189 ran kaa vishaal target diya
 Based on net run rate, Mumbai gets 14 goals to reach the target
 3 overon (87 gendon) main hasil karnaa tha
 Mumbai Indians were to score 190 runs in 87 balls
 mumbai kii pari kii 87veen gend par ambati raidu ran out ho gaye
 The match referee said that if Mumbai Indians score four runs on the next ball, then they will reach the play-off
 ballebaaji karne aae aditya taare ne chakka jad diya or mumbai indiens play of main pahunch gai
 But why Mumbai got the extra ball (88th ball) when actually extracting the net run rate (NRR), the final score is seen and not the target
 final score hi asal number hota he
 The team chasing the target reaches the final score and if they have a few more balls left to reach the target, they have a chance to raise their net run rate further
 14wein over kii teesri gend par plaof ke liye aavashyak ran banane main naakaam rahi mumbai 189 ke score par pahunchakar net ran rate ke maamle main rajasthan royles se aage ho gai thi
 Mumbai's net run rate of 0 on this stage
 078099 thi jabaki rajasthan kii 0
 Was 076821
 agar chauthi ball par mumbai single le leti to use jeet to mil jaati lekin uski net ran rate rajasthan se kam rahati
 To improve their net run rate from Rajasthan, Mumbai had to take their score to 191 on extra ball
 lekin yahaan twist ye tha ki 189 ke score par ataki mumbai ke liye do ran se kaam nahin chalata kyonki target 190 kaa hi tha
 He was declared victorious as soon as he took a run
 aise main unke paas us extra bos par boundry maarane kaa hi opshan tha
 Even if she went to extra ball dot, Mumbai still had a chance to hit the boundary on the fifth and sixth ball of the 14th over
 or agar 14wein over kii aakhir teenon gend dot chali jaatin to mumbai ko apni net ran rate rajasthan se acchhee karne ke liye 15wein over kii pehali gend par chakka jadna hota
 If this had happened, Mumbai's net run rate was 0
 080519 hoti or rajasthan kii 0
 074163
 ab mumbai kaa aglaa muqabla 28 may ko chennai superkings se hoga
