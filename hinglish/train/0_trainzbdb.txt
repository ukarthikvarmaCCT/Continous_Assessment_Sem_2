 aapako shaayad is baat par yakeen nahin ho rahaa hoga lekin ye sach he ki garlfriend nahin hone ke bhi kuch aise phaayde hai, jinke liye aise log tarasate hai jinaki garlfriend hai
 Well there are some positive and negative aspects of everything and this also applies here

 The first benefit of not having a girlfriend is that you can hang out with anyone
 aapaki jindagi main koi aisa nahin hota he jo aapako ye aadesh detaa rahe ki isse baat karo or usase nahin
 2
 garlfriend nahin hone kaa doosraa phayda ye he ki aapkaa jab dil kare aap apane doston ke saath ghoomane ja sakate hai
 Boyz can nightout
 aapako kisi ko ghadi-ghadi jawaab dene kii jaruratanhin hoti he

 garlfriend nahin hone kaa teesraa phayda yah he ki aap jaise marji ho, vaise rah sakate hai
 You don't have to interrupt
 koi yah kehane vaala nahin hota he ki juute sahi jagah par nahin rakhen hai, cameraa ganda kyon he, bartan saaf kyon nahin hai

 garlfriend nahin hone kaa chauthaa phayda ye he ki aapaki kamai aapaki he
 There is no one to teach you the lesson of saving
 aap jahaan chahen, jitna chahen, kharch kar sakate hai
 Not only this, you can also save according to your own needs

 One advantage of not having a girlfriend is also that you have enough time for yourself
 aap apana sara samay apane hisaab se apane upar kharch kar sakate hai or na hi aapako kisi se ye sunanaa hota he ki ab tum badal gaye ho or mujhe vakt nahin dete

 The same question is being asked about the Left party CPM whether it will form an alliance with the Congress in 2019
 nai dilli main CPM ke party mukhyalay main 2 dinon se chal rahi kendriya samiti kii baithak main bhi inhen atakalon par maathapai chal rahi he
 According to sources who attended the meeting, this leftist party is planning to enter into an alliance with the Congress in 2019
 sutron ke mutabik 3 saal ke bheetar hi CPM apane puraane stand se hatakar dobaaraa secular partiyon ke saath jane kii taiyaari kar rahi he, jisamen congress bhi shaamil he
 This is also important because in the party Congress held in Visakhapatnam 3 years ago, the proposal was passed that the Left parties would not form any alliance or alliance with the BJP nor the Congress
 kya hua CPM kii kendriya samiti kii baithak menhath lagi jaankaree ke mutabik CPM kii kendriya samiti kii baithak main party mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne ek prastaav rakhaa, jisamen kaha gaya he ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main BJP ko haraane ke liye vampanthi dalon ko sabhi dharmanirpeksh partiyon ke saath talmail rakhkar badhanaa hoga
 Though the Congress is not directly mentioned in this proposal, according to sources close to Yechury, Yechury wants to enter the electoral fray in the next Lok Sabha elections by entering into an ideological and electoral agreement with all secular parties, including the Congress
 yechuri or karaat main matbhedkendriya samiti kii baithak main yechuri or purv mahasachiv prakaash karaat ke bich matbhed khulkar saamne aa gaye
 Against Yechury's proposal to go with all secular parties, including the Congress, Karat moved a second resolution in the Central Committee meeting, which asked the Left parties not to keep electoral cohesion with any party
 prakaash karaat ne is prastaav main kaha he ki sipiem ko na hi BJP ke saath gathbandhan karnaa chahie or na hi congress ke saath
 The proposal presented by Prakash Karat is also important because the proposal has been approved by a majority in cpm's Politburo
 kya he paulitte beuro kaa mathhaal hi main hui sipiem paulitte beuro kii baithak main yechuri ne yah prastaav rakhaa tha kii party ko aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main congress samet tamaam dharmanirpeksh partiyon ke saath khadaa hona hoga, lekin16 sadasyeey paulitte beuromen yechuri apane is prastaav ko lekar akele pad gaye
 Prakash Karat rejected Yechury's proposal in the Politburo and said that the Left parties need to compromise neither the BJP nor the Congress
 prakaash karaat ke us prastaav ko paulitte beuro ne bahumat se paas kiya or yechuri ke prastaav ko alpamat main sahmati milob aage kya karegi sipiemparty mahasachiv yechuri kaa prastaav girane ke baad ab najar sipiem kii kendriya samiti kii agali baithak par he
 According to sources, the party cadre in Kerala and Tripura wants the CPM to stand with all secular parties including the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections so that there is no division of votes
 lekin party main prakaash karaat kaa gut yechuri ke is prastaav ke khilaaf he
 On Monday, the proposal of both Yechury and Prakash Karat may go to the Central Committee for voting
 voting ke baad kendriya samiti dwaara prastaavit rigerveshan ko sipiem agle saal hyderabad main hone vaali party congress main rakhegi
 CPM will decide its direction and condition for the 2019 elections only after this party Congress
 philhal party sutron kaa kahana he ki kendriya samiti ke zyaadaatar sadsy yechuri ke us prastaav se sahamat hai, jisamen 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko haraane ke liye sipiem tamaam dharmanirpeksh or vipakshi dalon ke saath chalane kii baat kahi gai he

 Young opener Abhinav Mukund said it was impossible to fill senior batsman Virender Sehwag's place but promised that he would leave no stone unturned for the remaining matches against England
 sahvaag kandhe ke oparation se ubar rahe hai or unki anupasthiti main gautam gambhir ke saath mukund pari kaa aagaaj kar rahe hai
 Mukund, who made his Test debut in the West Indies tour, said, "if you are thinking that i will fill Sehwag's place, then it is impossible
" vah bhartiya team ke mahanatam salaami ballebaaj hai or unki jagah koi nahin bhar saktaa
 If i try to bat like them, it is not possible
 main jaise jaanata hum, usee tarah se ballebaaji karuunga
 Mukund scored 49 in the first innings and 12 in the second innings in the first Test match at Lord's, but on both occasions he failed to play a big innings
 baayen haath ke is ballebaaj ko ab bhi uskaa malaal he
 He said, i could not play long innings and i was very disappointed
 main acchhee ballebaaji kar rahaa tha, lekin main us aatmavishvaas ko agle test main le ja saktaa hum
 Every child dreams of playing on the mecca of cricket and i was very excited, but unfortunately could not play long innings
 apane kariyar ke shuru main hi mukund ko duniya ke sabase damdaar tej akraman kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, lekin vah isse chintit nahin hai
 Munkud said that the time he is spending with the Indian team, he is getting to learn a lot
 unhone kaha, eemaandaaree se kahuun to bhartiya team ke saath itnaa adhik samay bitaane se aapako prayek din kuch na kuch seekhney ko miltaa he
 When a player like Sachin pats you on the back, it will boost anyone's confidence
 main bhi apana pradarshan sudhaarney par dhyaan de rahaa hum
 The next Test starts on Friday and England leading 1-0 in the series will try to strengthen their position
 yahaan kii paristhitiyaan seem or swing gendbaaji ke anukool hai
 Mukund said, i have not seen the wicket, but being the number one team in the world, we have to face every challenge that comes our way
 kai khilaadi behad anbhavi hai or is tarah kii paristhitiyon main khel chuke hai
 We have to present a good challenge
 mukund ne kaha ki yadi jahir khan is match main nahin khel pate hai, to bhartiya akraman puri tarah se pangu nahin ho jayega
 He said, Zaheer is our main bowler
 haalanki ishanth ne carabian daure main bahut acchhee gendbaaji kii
 Praveen took five wickets at Lord's and Sreesanth is waiting for his turn

 Jwala said that the bronze medal won in the Asian Badminton Championships would help to some extent to heal those wounds
 unhone kaha ki yah padak mere liye badale kii tarah he
 i am now playing with revenge
 maine kaaphi dard jhela he, yadi yah sab nahin jhela hota to padak jeetne kaa jashn achche se manaa sakati thi
 He said that whatever happened, it was unnecessary
 kisi khilaadi ko yah sab bhugatne kii kya jarurat he
 i did not ask for money for my achievements
 maine sammaan maanga tha lekin mila nahin
 Why favor with doubles players

 There is no doubt that harassing and harassing the bodyline is not new to English cricket

 The victory of Lord's on this Monday (21 July) has given us many interesting messages about cricket
 yah ki bharat bhi gend kii gati or oochaal se daraa saktaa he
 But the intention was clear with six players on the leg (including two short legs), none at slip, with one player at thirdman for a breathless hook shot
 yah bhartiya cricket kii nai peedi he jo apane desh main khel pratishthanon kii badhati takat par savaar he
 But why are we mixing cricket and its power politics? N

 Is it not just the logical result of the rise of Indian cricketers from small towns who no longer care about any kind of prestige or past accountability and despite being fed up in speaking English, do not get in awe of the British? This is the true characteristic of an emerging, ambitious society

 "second, the way he moved to Jimmy Anderson's side, the last player he had just runout to join hands to farewell, was a gesture of courtesy or, under general delight, i can't say
 lekin yah zyada mahatvapurn baat he kyonki bharat ne anderson par aarope lagaaya tha ki unhone trint brij kii sidhippon par jadeja ke saath khel bhaavana se pare jaakar durvyavhaar kiya he or jeet ke baavjood unhen maaf nahin kiya ja saktaa
 You may think that i am exaggerating this, but i am saying this as a person who still has a stain from 22 years ago
 maamla port elizabeth kaa he, jab dakshin africa ke capler vesals ne apane balle se kapil dev kii taang par khinchakar maaraa tha
 Then i was covering that series on behalf of India Today
 lakhon logon ne yah dekha ki kapil dev dard se jhuk gaye the
 Vessels was furious that he had just "dismissed" Kirsten
 lekin kya iske liye kisi kii taang par balla chalaa dena chahie? or vah bhi kapil dev jaise khilaadi par? bharat ne iskaa virodh kiya tha, lekin kamjor tareeke se
 If there was a big ruckus on it, threatened to end the tour, South Africans would have bowed
 lekin tab bharat alag tarah kaa tha or uske cricket pratishthan bhi
 Even Kapil was never able to give a satisfactory answer as to why he did not strongly oppose it when a big, blue stain had emerged on his leg
 jab ek lambey tivi intervyuu main maine jor dekar poocha tab bhi ve is par bolne ke liye taiyaar nahin hue, sivaay sirf kuch aise shabdon ke ki, ''koi bhi rajanyik ulajhn nahin chahta tha

 isliye anderson ab bhi kathghare main hai or shikaayat karne vaale jadeja unhen ranout karne ke tatkaal baad vidaai main haath milaane kaa dikhaava kar sakate hai
 We have seen this strength grow
 jaise match ref ri mike dennes ko baahar kar diya gaya tha, jab unhone dakshin africa main (2001 main) sachin tendulkar par gend se chhedchhad karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 For Andrew Symonds, when Harbhajan Singh used abuses starting with 'M', he was soft-spoken
 vastav main juri kaa ravaiya udaar tha jisane yah maan liya ki kisi kii maa ke liye is tarah kii 'tippaneeâ uski nasl par kuch kehane se to kam buree he
 This is the new strength of Indian cricket
 iskaa matlab yah he ki agar dakshin africa ke sirf is ravaie se hamen ksht pahunchaa he ki unhone aise vyakti ko board kaa adhyaksh chun liya jise ham pasand nahin karte the (haaron lorgat), to hamane vahaan kii siries ko sirf do test maichon tak simit karke unhen sajaa di
 Similarly, when England made us happy by restarting the series after the interruption of 26 / 11 terror attack, we accepted his request to do a five-test series as a prize, any post 2002 For the first time such a series happened with the country
 is takat kaa yah bhi matlab he ki bharat ke liye niyamon main badlaav kiya ja saktaa he, lards ke nattejey ke baad angreji media kii udhaas tippaniyon main yah vilaap har jagah dekha ja saktaa he
 Even Mike Briarley, who is generally moderate and fairly scholarly, started his article in The Times with a complaint by Stuart Broad that "batsman wanted DRS, Bowler wanted DRS, viewers wanted DRS, but Since India did not want DRS, we did not get DRS
 âmatch ke sandarbh main yah rochak baat thi ki angrej diares na milane kii shikaayat kar rahe the, jabaki tab tak kharaab ampiring kaa kul milakar unhen hi phayda mila tha, khaskar broad jinhen ajinkya rahane ke arm guard se ball takaraane ke baad bhi kaich out karne kaa phayda mila tha
 But the fact is that India did not like DRS and the rules were changed for that
 briyarly ne to bharat par aditol hone tak kaa aarope laga diya tha, likhaa ki ab vah saakh bachaane ke liye diares ko manjuur kar rahaa he or kaamana kii ki kaash! bharat ko kuch kharaab nirnay jhelane paden, taaki vah sahi raste par aa jaae
 James Estill, an old India Correspondent by the Economist, has noted this growing force in The Great Tamasha: Cricket, Corruption and the Turbulent Rise of Modern India
 (khulaasa: maine nai dilli ke british council main is pustak ke locarpan samaaroh main unke tathaa bisisiai ke tatkaaleen upaadhyaksh arun jetali ke saath ek charchaa kaa sanchaalan kiya tha)
 Estil has said, "BCCI has done things according to its strong financial grip on the game by showing the strength to remove the icc's anglo-australian veto law, which has never been used
" nateeja yah he ki bharat ab khud chunaav kar saktaa he (kiske khilaaf khelnaa he)
 
 
 He can also demand a waiver of his worth in any ICC agreement
 â iske baad astill ne australian cricket lekhak gidian hegg kaa hawala diya he: ''yah satta centre badalane se kuch zyada he
 It is like changing the nature of power
 âagar tanon parmaanu bamon ne kisi desh kii samrik shakti ko aarthik takat main badalane kaa rasta banaaya he, to usee tarah cricket ke oonche mukaam par parampara or itihaas ko vittiya majbootee or darshakon kii takat ke aage jhukta dekha gaya he

 Government is preparing for a change in the base year of GDP, behind this, questions are being raised about the government's intention, such a change in the base year is a normal and necessary process but the government's GDP figures have been viewed with suspicion
 It was said that the base year for National Accounts (GDP) will be changed from 2011-12 to 2017-18, since then there has been a lot of speculation that finally the government behind it Or intent and its consequences
 isaki ek vajah yah he ki hamaari arthvyavastha pichley paanch timahiyon se susti ke daur main he
 GDP growth 8 in the fourth quarter of FY 2018
 1 fisadi se ghatakar vitt varsh 2020 kii pehali timahi main 5 fisadi tak aa gai he or aage isamen or giravat hone kii ashanka he
 Secondly, there has been a lot of scrutiny over the last five years about the quality of data, as economists and experts from India and abroad have been raising serious concerns about political interference and want to restore the independence and honesty of statistical institutions
 Go iske baavjood jidipi anumaan ke base year main badlaav ke kai majboot kaaran hai
 The structural change of the economy is judged by an amendment in the base year
 Amendment in the base year is mandatory for better policy making
 aisa isliye kiya jaataa he taaki arthvyavastha main sanrachanaatmak badlaav par najar rakhi ja sake or un vrihad aarthik sanketakon main sudhaar yaa apadet kiya ja sake jo ki desh ke aarthik pradarshan ko darshaate hai
 Former Chief Statistician of India, TCA Anant first spoke about it in January 2018
 isamen kis tarah kaa badlaav ho saktaa he iske bare main vistaar se kaarykram kriyanvayan evam sankhyikeey mantralay (mospi) ne 8 may, 2019 ko ek note jari kar bataaya he
 This note states that India is now moving towards adopting the latest international standard such as the 2008 System of National Accounts (2008 SNA) developed by the United Nations in the adoption of the 2011-12 series, an update of the 1993 SNA is
 2011-12 ke siries main data sroton ke badlaavon ko shaamil kiya gaya, kawarej kaa vistaar kiya gaya or nae maanak ke mutabik prakriyaaon main sudhaar kiya gaya, lekin isamen or sudhaar kii jarurat he, khaskar emsie 21 database kii khaamiyon ko dur karne ke liye, jiske dwaara corporate sector ke utpaadan ko aanka jaataa he, or audyogic utpaadan suchakank (IIP) main badlaav ke liye
 This note also states that India has now adopted the imf's Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS)
 isamen yah kaha gaya he ki nae keemat suchakank kaa vikaas kar jidipi anumaanon main âdohare apsfitikaarak (dabl diflator)â ko apanaaya jaae
 India currently uses a single deflator (such as CPI, WPI or others), while the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, and Brazil have now adopted a double deflator, for output and input
 Different deflators are used
 base main badlaav kii avadhi 10 se 5 saal kii gaibese year main badlaav ke liye koi tay maanak nahin he
 Pranab Sen, India's first Chief Statistician (CSI) during 2007â10 and chairman of the National Statistical Commission (NSC) in 2013â16, states that the 2008 SNA recommends that the developing country be allowed every 5 years
 Changes should be made in your base year so that structural changes in the economy can be accurately assessed
 unhone kaha, âbadlaav kitni jaldi hoga yah is baat par nirbhar karata he ki arthvyavastha main kis teji se sanrachanaatmak badlaav ho rahe hai
 If an economy is stable, there is no need to change the base year for a long time
 iske bare main phir soch-samaj kar nirnay lenaa hoga
 'when India started the National Accounts Series in the year 1948-49, the amendments were done every 10 years, which coincidentally happened at the time of the census, because the census provided the correct figures of the workers
 yah chalan 1980-81 tak jari rahaa
 After this, from 1993-94, India started a change in base year based on the results of the survey of employment and unemployment every five years
 haalanki yah parampara bhi 2009-10 main tut gai, kyonki 2008 kii vaishvik mandi kii vajah se yah koi âsaamaanya saalâ nahin tha
 Therefore the next base year 2011-12 was fixed
 iske baad phir base year main 2016-17 main badlaav kiya janaa chahie tha, lekin tab badlaav nahin hua or aisa kyon nahin hua iske bare main jaankaree saamne nahin ai
 We are placing special emphasis on 2017-18 because the previous round of Employment Survey (PLFS) and Consumer Expenditure Survey was done in 2017-18
 saal 2017-18 kaa rojgaar survey (PLFS) aa chukaa he or pehle isse inkaar karne ke baad aakhir 2019 ke chunaav ke baad jari kar diya gaya
 It shows that the unemployment rate is the highest in the past 45 years (6
 1%) he
 The Consumer Expenditure Survey has not yet been released

 The process of estimation of GDP has so far been opaque
 isiilie aarthik surveykshan taiyaar karne main saal 2014 se 2018 tak sarkaar ke mukhya aarthik salaahkaar rahe arvind subramanian july 2019 main likhte hai ki, âantarnihit aankade saarvajanik rup se uplabdh nahin hote, isliye siesao ke baahar kaa koi bhi vyakti jidipi kaa anumaan nahin laga saktaa
 The National Accounts Division program is part of the Central Statistical Organization (CSO) of the Ministry of Implementation and Statistics (mospi)
 enessi ke purv chairman pisi mohanan kehete hai ki saal 2011-12 ke base year se pehle ise badalane ke liye jo bhi data istemaal kiye jate the, ve saarvajanik taur par uplabdh hote the
 All this changed from the year 2015, when the base year was changed to 2011-12
 sanrachanaatmak badlaav kaaphi khaamiyon vaale MCA21 data set par aadhaaritsaal 2011-12 ke siries main pehali baar corporate maamalon ke mantralay ke ek aparikshit or agyaat tip ke database kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 It is said to assess the production of corporate companies in the manufacturing and service sectors
 2011-12 ke siries main menuphaccharing or sevaaon ke sanrachanaatmak hissedari main jo bada badlaav dikh rahaa he, vah isi vajah se he
 You can see the effect of this using the series of 2004-05 and 2011-12 in comparative years below
 isamen menuphaccharing kaa hissaa kaaphi teji se badha he (14
 17% in FY14 from 9%
 2 fisadi) or sarvice sector kaa hissaa teji se gira he (67
 59 in FY14 from 4 per cent
 9 fisadi)
 MCA21 is still not made public today
 haalanki, april 2019 main jab eneseso ne MCA21 dataset par apni âtechnical report on services sector enterprijej in indiaâ prakashit kii to iske khulaase se arthshaastri or anya sabhi log chaunk gaye the
 It said, "about 45 per cent of MCA units were out of the survey, while 18 per cent of such cases were in EC / BR frame
 â iskaa matlab yah he ki e- sarvice sector main MCA21 kii kareeb 45 fisadi ikaayiyon kaa vastav main jameen par koi astitv hi nahin he, unka koi kaamkaaj nahin he (ve band yaa bekaar hai) athwa jis shrenee kaa unhen bataaya gaya he unamem unki koi gatividhi nahin he
 B- In other datasets such as Economic Calculation (EC) or Business Register (BR), such an error is very low at 18 per cent
 mospi ne may 2019 ke is nishkarsh par apni safai bhi jari kar di he, lekin isse andeh ko kam karnaa mushkil he
 The manufacturing sector's MCA21 unit has not yet been tested
 jidipi ke sandigdh aankadejanvari 2015 main jab 2011-12 siries jari kiya gaya, to yah bataaya gaya ki bharat kaa jidipi growth china se bhi zyada ho gaya he
 This first raised doubts in the minds of economists who were talking about the imbalance between GDP and other indicators
 iske baad ek phir andeh paidaa hua jab kareeb chaar saal baad november 2018 main back siries data jari kiya gaya
 The drama unfolded before this
 niti ayog ne do puraane sanshodhano ko khaarij kar diya jisamen yah dikhaaya gaya tha ki upie shashan ke dauraan jidipi main tej badhat hui thi, jabaki sachai to yah he ki is maamle main niti ayog kii kisi bhi tarah kii visheshgyata nahin he
 When the NITI Aayog finally allows the release of the back series, the following graph is generated from the mospi documents, which shows how the UPA government's GDP figures have been shown to be reduced in it
 notebandi or jiesti ke baad ke jidipi aankade badaye gaeiske baad 1 farvari, 2019 ko bajet pesh hone se ek din pehle jidipi aankadon main phir sanshodhan kiya gaya

e
 FY 2017

 2 per cent, which is the highest in the decade, and gdip growth figures for FY 2018 ie FY 2018
 7 fisadi se badhaakar 7
 2 per cent
 saal 2018 kii apni ek pustak main subramanian bataate hai ki kis tarah se notebandi or jiesti dohare jatke kii tarah the or inase kis tarah se iconomi ko baari nuksaan hua tha
 Regarding demonetisation, he writes, 'demonetisation was a widespread, serious, monetary setback' that led to a decline in GDP over the next 7-8 quarters
 june 2019 main subramanian ne harvard uniwarsity ke liye ek paper likhaa jisamen yah kaha gaya ki bharat ke growth anumaan ko saal 2011-12 se 2016-17 ke bich kareeb 2
 Shown to be increased by 5 per cent
 yah hamalaa abhi thanda hi padaa tha ki ek or paper main subramanian ne ek or gola daag diya, jisamen unhone kaha, âantarnihit aankade saarvajanik taur par uplabdh nahin hote, isliye siesao ke baahar kaa koi bhi vyakti âjidipi kaa anumaanâ nahin laga saktaa
 'what do you think about the change in base year?' Expertsen says that choosing the base year for the year 2017-18 is not good, as it was not a 'normal year' and it may be better to choose 2018-19
 unka kahana he ki isaki vajah yah he ki saal 2017-18 main do bade aarthik jhatkon kaa saamana karnaa padaa- november 2016 main notebandi kaa elaan hua or july 2017 main jiesti lagu kiya gaya
 Asked about the proactivity of the program implementation and statistical ministry (mospi) about this, Sen said the important thing in the amendment is whether the employment and consumer expenditure survey figures are available
 rojgaar ke aankade se yah pataa chalata he ki 2017-18 ko is maamle main kaaphi kharaab saal mana jaataa he (berogari dar 6
 1 per cent) and the other figure is also probably not good (it has not yet been made public) former RBI Governor Mohanan & c
 rangarajan kaa bhi yah maananaa he ki 2017-18 kaa saal saamaanya varsh nahin he, kyonki us saal notebandi or jiesti kaa asar tha
 Rangarajan said that if the government chooses a low-income year like 2017-18, it may be in trouble
 mohanan ne kaha ki unki mukhya chintaa MCA21 ke bare main he, jisamen menuphaccharing jidipi kaa hissaa kaaphi badha diya gaya he or sarvice jidipi kaa hissaa gata diya gaya he
 This dataset has not yet been made public and the question raised in its April 2019 NSSO report about its quality should be addressed and all experts should be satisfied before using it again

 Yeddyurappa also claimed that he has not been asked to resign
 is maamle par party kaa kendriya netritv bhi khamosh he
 a section of the BJP leadership believes that Yeddyurappa should resign as his image is being tarnished by his continuation as Chief Minister

 uk mamata banerjee ne poocha JEE pariksha main gujarati hi kyon?modi sarkaar ko kaha shuru ho sakate hai protestadesh kii pratishthit ejineering sansthaanon main daakhile ke liye yojit hone vaali joint entress ejamination (jeii main) pariksha ko lekar pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne pariksha kii bhashaa ko lekar modi sarkaar se sawaal puche hai
 Actually, JEE Main examination has been conducted in Hindi and English languages
 vahiin ab agle saal se hone vaali jeii main pariksha main hindi- angreji ke saath gujarati bhashaa ko vaikalpik bhashaa ke taur par shaamil kiya jayega
 Our country is India, which is home to so many religions, cultures, languages, creeds and communities
 However, maligning all regions and regional languages is the intention of the government at the centre
 (1 / 4) - Mamata Banerjee (@mamataofficial) November 6, 2019 In such a situation, Mamata Banerjee tweeted, asking, 'I like Gujarati language very much
 lekin pariksha main anya kshetreey bhashaaon kii andekhi kyon kii gai he? agar pariksha kaa aayojan gujarati main ho saktaa he to bengali bhashaa sahit anya kshetreey bhashaa main kyon nahin? 'unhone twit kar likhaa aashcharya kii baat he jeii main kii pariksha hindi or angreji main hoti he, vahiin vikalp ke taur par pariksha main keval gujarati bhashaa ko joda gaya
 This step is not commendable
 Joint Entrance Exams so long were conducted in English and Hindi languages
 Surprisingly, now only Gujarati language has been added
 Such a step is not at all praiseworthy
 (2 / 4) - Mamata Banerjee (@mamataofficial) November 6, 2019 He said that our country India is home to many religions, cultures, languages, creeds and communities
 haalanki, sabhi kshetron or kshetreey bhashaaon kii chav kharaab karnaa centre main sarkaar kii manshaa he
 He wrote that it is not right to do so
 kyonki baad main is mudde par joardaar virodh pradarshan ho saktaa he
 Because of this, the feelings of people speaking other regional languages will be deeply hurt
 news agency PTI ke anusaar kendriya madhyamik shiksha board ne 2014 main urdu, marathi or gujarati ko jeii main pariksha main joda tha
 However, in 2016, it removed Marathi and Urdu after which it was allowed to remain only Gujarati
 jab 2019 main sibiesai se entrens pariksha kii jimmedaari lekar neshnal testing agency (NTA) ko di gai thi
 Except this issue is decided gracefully, there will be strong protests all around as sentiments of people who speak other regional languages would be deeply hurt due to this injustice
 (4 / 4)â Mamata Banerjee (@mamataofficial)november 6, 2019uske baad jeii main kii pariksha hindi or angreji main yojit hone lagi
 Information about this was tweeted by the President of Trinamool Congress
 aashcharya kii baat he ki ab keval gujarati bhashaa ko joda gaya he
 Such a step is not commendable at all
 bataa den, mamata banerjee ne modi sarkaar ko salaah dete hue kaha ki agar is maamle kii ore dhyaan nahin diya gaya to desh main har jagah "majboot virodh" shuru ho saktaa he
 He said that India is home to many languages, cultures and religions, but the government's intention at the center is to discredit all regions and regional languages
 aapako bataa den, jeii main pariksha ke sambandhit vibhaag ne spasht kiya he ki pariksha main un bhashaaon ko shaamil kiya gaya tha jinamein rajyon dwaara kabhi bhashaa kaa anurodh kiya gaya tha

 rail mantri ne phir se vaajapeyi ji ko yaad karte hue kaha : jab tak dhyey puraa na hoga, tab tak pag kii gati na rukegi, aaj kahe chaahe kuch duniya, kal ko bina jhuke na rahegi

 He said, we have already started our journey and i want to complete this journey also

 Well, the team did light workouts in the gym for about two hours
 haalanki khilaadiyon ko asiu ke adhikariyon se baahar lunch kii ijaajat mil gai
 These conditions are very difficult for the team
 captain dhoni ne sochaa to ye hoga ki desh ke baahar team ko tarotaaja hone kaa mauka milegaa, or khilaadi sirf cricket ke bare main sochenge
 But even across seven seas, the shadow of fixing is behind the team
 team india par desh or duniya bhar ke phans kii najar he or jis tarah ye team vahaan najarband kii gai he uski wo aadi nahin he
 In the year 2000, when Team India went through the shadow of fixing, no player of the current team was in that dressing room
 aise halaat main ab sab kuch captain dhoni aa tikaa he
 In the shadow of the eyes, he has to fight and win the war of England

 haalanki unhone saaf kiya ki unke paas jadeja ke vikalp maujuud hai
 Dhoni said that in the Champion's Trophy, the Indian team will start the innings with Murali Vijay and Shikhar Dhawan
 unhone kaha ki rohit sharma ko tisare openar ke taur par rakhaa jayega
 Dhoni made it clear that Dinesh Karthik will be placed in middle order
 saath hi dhoni ne mana ki ipel ke turant baad team india acha pradarshan nahin karti lekin unhone ye bhi kaha ki iske liye ipel ko dosha dena galat hoga

 After the ongoing tussle between the US and Pakistan on the issue of terrorism, the diplomatic relations between the two countries are also seen in crisis
 ek taraf jahaan islamabad main sadak haadase ke aaropee america adhikari par pakistan pabandi lagane kii prakriya main juta he
 At the same time, the news now is that the US can also increase the strictness on the Pakistani officials present in their country and ban their movement
 pakistani media ke mutabik, trump prashasan ne is sambandh main pakistan se baat kii he or chetavanee di he ki agar pakistan main unke adhikariyon ko pabandi se raahat nahin di gai to washington main maujuud unke rajanyikon ke saath bhi vaisaa hi sulak kiya ja saktaa he
 It is not being allowed to go beyond 40 kilometers, that any Pakistani diplomat present in the US will have to take permission from the US administration to travel more than 25 miles or about 40 kilometers
 aise kisi safar par jane ke liye rajanyikon ko kam se kam paanch din pehle america prashasan ko suchit karnaa hoga
 The ban may come into force from May 1, however, US officials are not looking at the move by linking it to recent accidents
 kaha ja rahaa he ki is masale par donon deshon ke bich kuch hafton pehle hi charchaa ho chuki he
 US officials also claim that the order has nothing to do with the recent road accident
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki america main pakistani adhikariyon par yah pabandi 1 may se lagu ho jaaegi
 There was a death in the road accident, in fact, the speed of Joseph Emmanuel of the US Embassy in Islamabad hit the bike with a land cruiser
 bike par do log savaar the, jinamein se ek kii ilaaj ke dauraan maut ho gai
 It is being told that a US diplomat can be prosecuted in Pakistan
 saath hi unhen desh se baahar jane se rokane ke liye pakistan ne unka naam 'agsit control list' main bhi shaamil kiya he
 So that they will not be able to go out of the country without permission
 bataa den ki donald trump ne jab se america kii kaman sanbhali he tab se hi unhone pakistan ke par kartane shuru kar die he
 The US has also reduced Pakistan's financial aid considerably by not giving up its stubbornness to shelve terrorism
 aise main ab rajanyikon par lagaam lagane kaa yah america kaa yah kadam pakistan ke liye ek or bada jhatka mana ja rahaa he

 His colleague Datta Avari said that during the fast, Anna, who was campaigning against corruption, lost more than five kilograms of weight and his blood pressure also fell

 The apex court was hearing a public interest litigation in which the convicts were disqualified under the Election-related Act as long as they were requested to ban political parties and become officials in it
 supreme court ne sawaal uthaate hue centre sarkaar se poocha ki agar koi vyakti chunaav nahi lard saktaa to wo koi bhi raajnneetik party kaise bana saktaa he? saath hi wo party ke ummidavaar ko chunaav ladane ke liye kaise chun saktaa he? ye badi alag sthiti he ki koi vyakti chunaav to nahin lard saktaa lekin wo raajnneetik party bana kar chunaav ladane ke liye ummidavaaron kaa chayan kar saktaa he

 The Supreme Court raised the question and asked the central government that if a person cannot contest elections then how can he form any political party? Also, how can he choose the party candidate to contest the election? It is a very different situation that a person cannot contest elections but he can select candidates to contest elections by forming a political party
 aise log agar skool yaa koi duusari sanstha banaate hai to koi samasya nahin he lekin wo ek party bana rahe hai jo sarkaar chalaaegi, ye matter karata he

 The school administration immediately admitted the children to the hospital
 doctoron ke mutabik, sabhi bachche abhi khatre se baahar hai
 The parents rushed to the school after receiving information that the children engaged in the school were ill
 unhoneskul prashasanke khilaaf pradarshan kiya
 During this time, the basic education officer who reached the school was taken hostage by the people
 haalanki, adhikariyon ke aashwaasan ke baad logon ne unhen chhod diya
 The police revealed the entire conspiracy by arresting three accused who shot and injured the woman in Jamia area of delhi
 yah khulaasa kisi filmi script se kam nahin he
 Actually the woman who was shot was raped along with her minor daughter
 aaropee sajid ke khilaaf cese darj hua tha, lekin vah faraar chal rahaa tha
 According to the information, just by taking advantage of this, Sajid's enemies hatched a sensational conspiracy
 is maamle main pehle pakadaa gaya ek aaropee faijal jo kabhi purv rajya sabha saansad kaa driver tha, uskaa sajid se property vivaad tha
 Faizal made a plan that if the rape victim or his mother is attacked, the suspicion will go to Sajid
 sajeesh ke tahat faijal ne apane saathi ikbaal or wasim ke saath rape kii shikaar ladki kii maa ko jaan se maarane kaa plan banaaya
 Under this plan, the woman was shot in Jamia area, but the woman was immediately rushed to the hospital and saved her life

 24 varshiya shahanaz ne chikitsak banakar marijon kii seva karne ke bajaay raajnneetik ilaaj ke jariye aamajan ke marz ke jaanane or unke dard ko dur karne kaa rasta chunaa
 Shehnaz was elected sarpanch in the last Panchayat elections from the Gadhajan Gram Panchayat of Bharatpur district
 shahanaz ne sarpanchi chunaav main apane kareebi pratidwandvi nishaar mohammad ko 195 voton se shikast dekar shandaar jeet hasil kii
 Shahnaz was born in Gadhajan
 ghar main raajnneeti kaa maahaul pehle se hi tha
 Actually, Shahnaz's grandfather Chaudhary Tayyab Hussain has been a cabinet minister in the Congress
 maa jaahida khan bhi kama seat se vidhayak raheen
 Perhaps this is the reason why Shahnaz chose the path of politics even after being out of the village for most of the time
 embibies kii padhai puri karne or chikitsak kii sarkari naukari kaa avasar milane ke baad bhi unhone sarpanchi kaa chunaav ladaa or jeeta
 Sarpanch Shahnaz Khan presented a beautiful picture of the future during the conversation
 doctor banakar dukhiyon kaa dard dur karne ke bajaay siyaasi stethoscope ko gale main latakaane ke sawaal ke jabaav main shahanaz boleen-" marijon ke marz ko samajhane or ilaaj karne vaale log kaaphi hai lekin dehaat kaa dard jismani takalifon se bahut zyada he
 Most people come to earn money in politics but that is not my objective at all
 bachapan se kishoravastha ke bich maine mere gaanv or dehaat main pasre dard ko bahut kareeb se mahasoos kiya he
 Studies were necessary to take the family, neighborhood, village, locality and country on the path of progress
 use maine embibies kii degree ke saath puraa kiya
 Now, the purpose of life is to bring our village and area back on the path of development and do something different from the rut that people of my area should look up to and see others follow
 "bhavishya ke liye aapaki yojana kya he? puche jane par vah boleen-" sabase pehla kaam he-shaharon kii ore palaayan karte mere gaanv or dehaat ke logon ko rokna
 The crumbling farming and machine age due to lack of rain has made the residents of my village and countryside unemployed
 berozegaar log aparaadh kii andhi khai main sarakane lage hai
 In such a situation, the first need is to create cottage industries in the countryside
 sarkari yojanaon ke saath-saath main vyaktigat taur bhi ekal evam samooh main kutir dhandhe shuru kar jald se jald palaayan ko rokane kii koshish karongi
 Shehnaaz says that there are toilets in every house here
 hamaari gram panchayat kaaphi pehle hi odief ghoshit ho chuki he
 Shehnaz said, all the schemes of the government are good and public beneficial but most of the people are not able to take advantage of those schemes due to not being educated and lack of meaningful initiative of public representatives
 isliye ve behatar shiksha or achche swasthya ke mishan ko amalijama pehanaane ke paak makasad ko lekar siyaasi galiyaaron main ai hai
 He said that there is not a single house here, out of which girls do not go to school
 gadhajan gram panchayat ko nai shakl or surat dene vaali shahanaz ne ek sawaal ke jabaav main kaha-"haa! kyon nahin? yadi mere vidhansabha kshetra ke log chahenge to main bhavishya main chunaav main bhagya jarur aajamaaungi

 com / 7qg51kbqfh The film's executive producer Manoj Mitra and the head of the dancers have given a clarification in the case of breaking out of the female dancer at Housefull 4's studio
 mitra ne kaha he ki is tarah ke vivaad kaa hona behad niraashajanak he
 As the executive producer of the film, i want to clarify that the incident mentioned in the news did not take place on the sets during the shoot
 ye shooting ke baad ghati
 By that time, Akshay Kumar and Ritesh Deshmukh had left
 ise sanbhaalanaa hamaari kshamtaaon ke baahar he
 Mitra said that this is a personal matter of dancers
 iskaa film shoot se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Dancers head Raman Dave has said that after the pack up there was a debate outside the set between the boys
 ladki apane kuch saathiyon ko bachaane kii koshish kar rahi thi
 She wanted to stop the fight
 isi dauraan kuch logon ne pakadakar alag karne kii koshish kii
 The fight was between Dancers and Outsider Pawan Shetty
 bataa den kihousephul4 ke liye shooting kar rahe dancers ne aarope lagaaya ki kuch log jabaran set par ghus aae or femail dancer se chhedchhad karne lage
 One of the accused is said to be Pawan Shetty
 is ghatana ke baad kareeb 100 dancers ne amboli police stesan jaakar aropiyon ke khilaaf exiaar darj karai he
 Police is investigating the case
 kuch reports main kaha gaya tha ki is vivaad ke dauraan set par akshay kumaar, bobi deol or ritesh deshmukh maujuud the
 But the executive producer has denied this
 unhone ise dancers kaa aapasi vivaad bataaya he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the upcoming assembly elections, Dr
 harshavardhan ko party ke mukhyamantri ummidavaar ke taur par pesh karne kaa faisla kiya he
 This information has been given by senior sources of BJP
 yah faisla party dwaara karaae gaye aantarik or bahari survey ke nateezon ke baad liya gaya, jisamen vijay goyal ke netritv main aagaamee chunaavon main party ke pradarshan main sudhaar hota nahin dikh rahaa tha
 Sources said that the party wants to put forward the leader of clean image as the CM candidate, hence Dr
 harshavardhan ko project karne kaa faisla kiya gaya
 Let us tell you that in the month of February this year, BJP had appointed Vijay Goel as the President of Delhi unit
 unke 8 maheene ke kaarykaal ke dauraan party ke andar bade str par gutbaji or andruni uthapatak hui jis vajah se bijepi sattarudh congress ke ek maatr vikalp ke taur par ubhar kar nahin aa saki
 After Vijay Goel's experiment failed, it seems that BJP has recognized that the image of the candidate leading the party in urban centers like Delhi is the most important and besides that Vijay Goel has failed to excite the enthusiasm within the party workers Huh
 in sabake alaava party ke kai senior netaaon ko baar-baar vijay goyal kii chhavi or unke kaam karne ke andaaj ke khilaaf shikaayat milte rahe he
 In the internal survey conducted by BJP, the traditional voters of the party gave negative votes to Vijay Goel
 bijepi ke wafaadaar to yahaan tak maanate hai ki philhal unki party sattarudh congress ke khilaaf majboot chunauti nahin pesh kar rahi
 According to an opinion poll conducted by India Today c-voter in August 2013, Vijay Goyal got just 12 per cent of the votes in the race for CM, while Arvind Kejriwal, who started in politics, was far ahead of him with 21 per cent votes
 vahiin lagaataar teen baar se mukhyamantri rahane ke baavjood shila dikshit 40 fisadi voton ke saath is res main sabase aage bani hui thim
 The source said that Harshvardhan's name will be announced in the coming days
 vijay goyal ke kareebi netaa is faisle kaa jabardast virodh kar rahe hai, lekin party kaa maananaa he ki agar unhen dilli main sarkaar bananaa he to vijay goyal ko darkinar karne alaava koi vikalp nahin bachaa
 The party's thinktank believes that there is a lot of public anger against the Sheila government of Delhi and if the party wants to draw anti-congress votes, it can be done by projecting the right candidate
 arvind kejariwal or aam aadmi party ko chunavi kshetron or opinian pole main mil rahe jabardast samarthan se bijepi kaa netritv sakhte main he
 The party leadership feels that the AAP has managed to carve out the role that the BJP had to play
 india today si-voter opinian pole main ye baat bhi saamne ai thi ki aam aadmi party 17 fisadi vot hasil karne main kaamyaab ho rahi he
 The BJP believes that most of the votes received by AAP are official, which should have come to the bjp's account
 gauratlab he ki bijepi ke kai varisht netaaon ne saamaajik kaaryakarta kiran bedi ko bhi dilli loksabhaa seat kii peshkash kii thi par unhone is peshkash ko yah kehete thukraa diya ki vah araajnneetik hi rahanaa chaahati hai
 Who is Dr
 harshvardhandilli Dr
 for BJP harshavardhan kaa naam kisi parichay kaa mohataaj nahin he
 Harshvardhan, an MLA from East Delhi's Krishnanagar seat, has won this seat four times in a row
 1993 main pehali baar jitkar vidhansabha pahunche or unhen dilli ke swasthya mantri kii jimmedaari mili
 Dr
 Harsh Vardhan's tenure as Health Minister is still remembered by profession
 2008 main vidhansabha chunaavon ke vakt dow
 Harshvardhan was the BJP President
 tab unke mukhyamatri pad ke ummdeevaar ke taur par project karne kii puri ummid thi lekin ain maukey par party ne vijay malhotra ko siem ummidwar ghoshit kar diya tha
 Dr
 harshavardhan kii chhavi saaf suthere or eemaandaar netaa kii he
 The choice of the Sangh and the support of jaitley-gadkari may be helpful in declaring him as the CM candidate from the BJP

 For instance, the pakoda shops of Old Surat Jail and Sabarmati Central Jail located in Ahmedabad are famous among the residents of both cities

 The special thing about these pakoras is that they are sold cheaper than the market rates and the best quality oil is used to make them
 jelon ko pakora dukaanon se hone vaala munafa mazdooree ke rup main kaidiyon ko baant diya jaataa he
 Some of the profits also go to the Prison Welfare Fund

 is sho se prise mani ke rup main unhen 10 lakh rupye mili the, is rakam se unhone bahan kii shaadi dhoomdhaam se kii thi
 After this, Kapil appeared in many shows like 'comedy Circus', 'jhalak Dikhhla Jaa' and 'comedy Nights with Kapil'
 philhal ve soni tivi ke sho 'da kapil sharma sho' ko host kar rahe hai
 Along with the host, he has played the lead role in the Bollywood film 'kis Kisko Pyaar Karoon'

 ) The GST Council held its 25th meeting on Thursday, just two weeks before the budget
 is baithak se pehle ummid jataai ja rahi thi ki petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke daayre main laane par koi faisla ho saktaa he
 Everyone was waiting for real estate to be taken under its purview, but no decision could be taken on both these fronts
 nahin hui charchapetrol or dijalki keemten lagaataar badhati ja rahi hai
 79 on a liter of petrol in Mumbai on Friday
 58 par pahunch gai he
 At the same time, diesel has also crossed Rs 66 here
 is badhotaree ke baad ummid jataai ja rahi thi ki petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke daayre main laayaa jayega, lekin is par na charchaa hui or na hi koi faisla hi ho sakaa
 This is the fact that the consent of all the states is necessary to bring petrol and diesel under the purview of GST
 philhal sabhi rajya iske liye taiyaar nahin hai
 One important reason for this is revenue
 petrol or dijal kii bikri se rajyon kaa kaaphi zyada rajasav aata he
 This revenue is available to them through VAT on diesel and petrol
 50 rupee se kam ho jaaegi keembgar in donon eendhan kojisti ke daayremen laayaa jaataa he, to centre kii taraf se lagane vaali exise duty or rajyon kaa waite khatm ho jayega
 a maximum of 28 percent tax will be levied under GST
 kyonki nai tex niti main philhal yahi sabase ucchtam dar he
 This will reduce the prices of petrol and diesel by less than Rs 50
 rajyon ko aapattiisse bhale hi aam aadmi ko raahat mili, lekin rajyon ko isse rajasav main bada nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 This is the reason that all states are taking time to give their consent for this
 lekin jald ho jayega faislavitt mantri arun jetali negiasti parishadki baithak ke baad bataaya ki bhale hi sabhi rajya philhal iske liye raji nahin hai, lekin congress petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke tahat laane ke liye taiyaar he
 This will make the path a little easier
 unhone ummid jataai ki parishad kii agali baithak main isko lekar koi faisla ho saktaa he
 Discussion on real estate but not the decision, only when talking about real estate, it was discussed in the 25th meeting of the council
 haalanki ise jiesti ke daayre main laane par koi faisla nahin ho sakaa
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that the states have also opposed bringing it under the purview of GST
 isaki vajah se isko lekar koi faisla nahin ho sakaa
 Now the next meeting, the watchdog minister said that the good thing is that the Congress is agreeing to bring real estate under GST like petrol and diesel
 isse agali baithak main is morche par koi faisla le paanaa aasaan hoga
 He said that a final decision could be taken in the next meeting on petrol-diesel and real estate

 Former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly revealed that Sachin had a habit of sleeping in his childhood

 Sourav Ganguly said that he was Sachin Tendulkar's room mate in the Under 14 camp organized by BCCI in Indore
 ek raat ko sachin apane bistar se uthe or kamare main gum kar phir apane bistar par aakar so gaye
 Ganguly felt that Sachin might have gone to the bathroom
 lekin agali raat ko bhi aisa hua
 After this, Ganguly spoke to Sachin
 tab ganguli ko sachin ne bataaya ki unhen neend main chalane kii beemaari he
 Ganguly got scared knowing this
 iske baad vah jab bhi sote to unka dhyaan sachin par hi rahata
 Ganguly also said that when he opened with Sachin, he would always face the first ball
 sachin kabhi bhi pehali gend khelnaa pasand nahin karte the
 Once Ganguly was going through poor form, he did not want to face the first ball
 lekin vah sachin se bolen kaise
 But when Ganguly and Sachin reached the crease in this match against Pakistan, Dada went first and stood on the non-strike end
 ab sachin ke paas strike lene ke alaava koi or vikalp nahin tha
 Ganguly jokingly said that he would be the only captain in the world who had to request a strike from his player

 aparoksh rup se is vivaad kii yaad taaja karte hue ek fain ne irfan ko bete kaa naam daaud yaa yaqub nahin rakhane kii salaah de daali thi
 But Irfan Pathan gave such a patriotic reply, on the advice that he got it without asking, that everyone woke up
 irfan pathan ne apane is prashansak ko jawaab main twitor par likhaa, 'naam chaahe kuch bhi rakhenge, lekin ek baat pakki he wo bhi papa or bade papa kii tarah is mulk (desh) kaa naam roshan karegaa
 He also referred to the question of a student in a college in Lahore on a tour of Pakistan in 2004, who asked Pathan why do you play for India as a Muslim? Answer i said i was born in India, i am an Indian, being an Indian i am proud
 apane desh ke liye khelnaa mere liye pratishtha or kismat kii baat he
 Millions of cricketers play cricket, but i have got the opportunity to represent the country
 main desh ke liye jo bhi chota-motaa kaam kar paaun mujhe usapar fakr he
 " haal hi main apane bete kaa naam imran rakhane par twitor main ai pratikriya par bhi irfan ne jawaab diya kaha " soshal media bahut pechida plateform he, ek aisa madhyam he jahaan aap apane phens se sidhe jud sakate hai
 Initially i was very dilemma but got very much love when connected
 haa, kuch ghatnaayen ho jaati hai kuch log aapako bhadakaane kii koshish karte hai wo bhi bachche kaa naam rakhane jaisi baat par
 Actually, my elder brother's name was Imran, who died in three and a half years
 meri ammi kai baar mujhe hi imran bulaakar bhavuk ho jaati thi tab maine tay kiya tha ki apane bete kaa naam imran rakhuunga
 There is a way to talk to people on social media, i am so lucky that i got so much love
 tippaniyan Significantly, two months ago there was a debate on social media about the name of Taimur, the newborn son of Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor
 irfan pathan bhi bete ke pita bane
 Reminiscent of this controversy, a fan had advised Irfan not to name his son Dawood or Yakub
 lekin bina maange mili is salaah par irfan pathan ne deshbhakti kii bhaavana se bharaa aisa jawaab diya ki har koi vaah-vaah kar uthaa tha
 Irfan Pathan wrote to his fan on Twitter, 'whatever the name will be, but one thing is sure, he will also illuminate the name of this country (father) like father and elder father
 2004 main pakistan daure par lahore ke ek college main ek chaatra ke sawaal kaa bhi unhone zikr kiya jisane pathan se poocha tha aap muslmaan hokar bharat ke liye kyon khelte hai jawaab main maine kaha main bharat main paidaa hua hum, bhartiya hum, bhartiya hone par mujhe garv he
 It is a matter of prestige and luck for me to play for my country

 com / 627noukyeg Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Mulayam Singh Yadav has said that if Narendra Modi wants to contest elections from Uttar Pradesh, he should come forward and learn the culture and politics of the state where people are not divided on communal basis
 unhone kaha, âunhen yah nahin sochna chahie ki uttar pradesh gujarat he kyonki donon rajyon kii samskritiyon main jameen-aasmaan kaa antar he
 As far as political thinking and social outlook are concerned, there is a lot of difference between the people of the two states
 âyadav ne kaha, âagar modi uttar pradesh se chunaav ladane ko icchhuk hai, to unhen aage aane dijie taaki ve yahaan ke shantipriy matadaataaon kii samskruti or raajnneeti ko samaj saken jo sampradayik bhaichara evam sauhadra ke saath rah rahe hai
 When asked about the SP candidates to be fielded against Congress President Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and other important constituencies, she said, "the decision will be taken by the party's parliamentary board
" â Rejecting the allegations of opposition leaders including Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, Modi said that he comes to Gujarat, spreads lies about Gujarat's son and makes baseless allegations
 unhone (congress ne) sardaar patel ke bare main bhi aisa hi kiya tha
 No Gujarati will accept their lies
 aapako bataa den ki congress pichley kuch samay se modi sarkaar par rafel saude ko lekar nishaanaa sadhti rahi he

 Let us tell you that a new AC has been installed in this house
 saath main modi ke liye floor par karpet bhi bicha die gaye hai
 This time Sikh Guru Sahiban and many chapters of Sikh History have been missing in the 12th books of history being taught in the schools of Punjab School Education Board
 akali dal kaa aarope he ki nai kitaab main sari sikh history hi gaayab kar di gai he
 And the chapters that have been newly planted
 inkaa punjab ke saath koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 The Akali Dal has also sought the opinion of the expert committee on this
 akali dal kaa aarope he ki sikh guruon ke chapter hataa kar is kitaab main sakhi sarwar or lakhan ke daata kii history shaamil kar lee gai he
 The new book, which has just come out the PDF version
 isamen 13 chapter or 178 panne hai
 Only one chapter of Sikh history has been kept in these
 sikh history ko plus 1 main shift kiyakitab ke do bhaag hai pehle main purv aadhunik kaal or duusare main aadhunik kaal he
 Cities, trade, crafts, chieftains, emperors and merchants, priests, monks, donors, political and economic development in medieval India, sultans and emperors, new forms of bhagati and opposition to 1857 in the second modern period Part 2, India in the pre-modern period, India The rise of nationalism in India, India, Sikh Raj and British Raj towards independence
 punjab skool shiksha board ne daawa kiya he ki unhone sikh history ko plus 1 main shift kar diya he or usamen mahaj pehle bhaag main punjab kaa itihaas ke hi 6 chapter darj kiye hai
 It records the sources of the history of Punjab, the Gurukalas, the teachings and travels of Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the development of Sikhism and the contribution of Sikh Gurus, the conversion of Sikhism, the establishment of the Khalsa Panth and the four Sahibzade, while Part 2 contains Sikh History
 Has nothing to do with akali dal ladega ye ladaayeepunjab main aam taur par 11veen main hi 12veen kaa hi silebus karavaaya jaataa he, taaki board kii pariksha main do saal kii taiyaari ho sake
 On the issue of removing syllabus related to Sikh Gurus from the 12th books of the Punjab Education Department, Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Badal said that the Punjab government has excluded Sikh history from the 12th syllabus, the Shiromani Akali Dal condemns it and On this issue, the government gives 3 days, if the government does not take back the revenge syllabus, then on May 3, a meeting of the core group of Shiromani Akali Dal will be held, in which further The strategy will be prepared and the Shiromani Akali Dal will fight this battle
 shiromani akali dal ke pradhan sukhbir badal kaa kahana he ki congress kii niti anti sikh-anti punjab he
 The Congress has put Sikh history out of the syllabus and put the history of the Congress in it
 congress party ke itihaas se judaa chapter jodeykali dal ke senior leader or punjab ke purv shiksha mantri dow dalajit singh cheema ne 12veen class kii itihaas kii puraani kitaab or punjab sarkaar ke dwaara silebus main badlaav karke jari kii gai nai kitaab dikhaai or bataaya ki kis tarah se puraani kitaab jo ki kareeb 400 pannon kii hoti thi or uske andar punjab ke tamaam sikh dharm guruon se jude chapter or unka puraa itihaas hua karata tha, un tamaam chaptaron ko is nai kitaab main sirf do pej ke ek chapter main tabdeel kar diya gaya he or itihaas kii kitaab main congress party kii sthapana or congress party ke itihaas se judaa chapter jod diya gaya he
 Daljit Singh Cheema said that only after the consent of the Congress government, the Punjab Education Board officials made these changes in the history book and the chapters related to Sikh history and religion have been deliberately excluded
 2019 ke chunaav ke chalate bayaanbajeeis maamle par punjab ke shiksha mantri o pi soni ne kaha ki akali dal ne hameshaa hi logon ko gumraah karne kii raajnneeti kii he, jabaki sarkaar ne sikh dharm or sikh dharmaguruon se judaa salebs 11veen ke saath-saath 12veen main bhi sikh itihaas ko shaamil kiya he
 The Akali Dal is misleading people by doing politics of religion
 unhone kaha ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ko dekhte hue akali dal is tarah kii bayaanbaji kar rahaa he, jabaki janata sab kuch jaanati he
 Now the public will not be misled by them
 vahiin is puure maamle par punjab skool ajukeshan board ne safai di or kitaab ko taiyaar karne vaale tamaam penlist or ek exparts ko media se rubaru karavaaya
 None of the chapters were deleted, and Dr
 Amanpreet Singh and Dr
 Jasvir Singh, who were in the panel to prepare the book, said that the work of preparing this book was going on since 2014 and they tried that the children of Sikhism and religious leaders who are in 12th class They study in the school, they should start from the junior class itself
 isiilie pichley kuch saalon main junior se lekar senior secondary tak kii books main is silebus ko shaamil kiya gaya he or kisi bhi tarah ke chapter delit nahin kiye gaye hai
 Punjab school education board history subject expert Seema Chawla said that it is being wrongly said that the subject matter related to religious teachers has been reduced from the books of Punjab Board
 punjab skool ajukeshan board kii safipunjab skool ajukeshan board kii taraf se safai di gai ki jis daur kii baat is itihaas kii kitaab main kii ja rahi he, us daur main congress party kaa udai hua tha
 For this reason, the history of the Congress Party has also been written in this book
 is puure vivaad main aam aadmi party ne bhi punjab skool ajukeshan board or punjab sarkaar ko white paper jari karke punjab kii janata ko ye bharosa dilaane ke liye kaha ki punjab skool ajukeshan board kii kitabon se sikh dharmaguruon se jude chaptars ko hataaya nahin gaya he
 Warning of the movement, the Punjab School Education Board and the Education Minister of the Punjab Government may have clarified the matter, but in the coming time, this ruckus does not seem to stop and the Akali Dal as well as the BJP have also sent an ultimatum to the Punjab Government It has been given that that old book of history which contains chapters related to Sikh religious leaders, that book should be taught once again in the schools of Punjab
 Issue will be a greater movement
