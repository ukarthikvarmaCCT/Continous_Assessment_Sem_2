 ’’ unhone kaha ki pakistan par dabaav banane ke liye unhone haal main america kii pratinidhi sabha main pakistan virdohi do vidheyak pesh kiye hai

 Republican Congressman Ted Poe wrote in an article published in The Washington Times titled "long history of Pakistan's double-handedness" that the United States has been able to meaningfully confront or end relations with Pakistan over dishonesty Has survived because the route supplied to the coalition in Afghanistan passes through Pakistan

 neshnal dizaster management athurity yani NDMA pichley 4 saal se apane vaais chair person kii niyukti kaa intjaar kar rahi he
 This authority has the responsibility to deal with all the disasters of the country and make policies
 jo kaam sarkaar ko karnaa tha vah nahin hone ke badadilli hoicortmen 2017 main ek janhit yachika lagaai gai
 The court also gave notice to the central government in this matter, but as of now between 2014 and 18, the National Disaster Management Authority does not have its vice chairman
 khud desh ke pradhanmantri is athurity ke chairman hai
 During the hearing of the case on Wednesday, the Delhi High Court questioned the Ministry of Home Affairs, how can an officer of joint secretary rank attend the NDMA meeting? Is this not a violation of the NDMA Act? According to the Act, presence of either the Prime Minister or the Vice Chairman is necessary in any meeting of NDMA
 darasal, neshnal dizaster management athurity kevise chayaramenaki niyukti kii yachika par sunwaayee ke daurandilli hoicourtne grih mantralay se sawaal kiya ki kaise koi joint secretary rank kaa adhikari neshnal dizaster management athurity kii meeting main bhaag le saktaa he
 If a joint secretary rank officer participates in this meeting, then it is against the Disaster Management Act
 dilli hoicourt main haal hi main grih mantralay ne endieme kii meeting ko lekar court main halafanama lagaaya tha, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki endieme main filhal chayarmen kii niyukti karne kii abhi jarurat nahin he, kyonki NDMA kii meeting main khud joint secretary jate hai
 The importance of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) can be gauged from the fact that anywhere in the country, the situation like Kerala or Bhuj earthquake, it is the responsibility of NDMA to deal with most

 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne rajasthan main vidhansabha chunaav se pehle rajyasabha saansad madanlaal saini ko party pradesh adhyaksh banaakar bada daanv chalaa he
 This will help BJP overcome the resentment of the OBC community and also dent the traditional Congress votes
 darasal, rajasthan ke purv mukhyamantri or congress mahasachiv ashok gahalot usee mali samudaay se aate hai, jisase madanlaal saini aate hai
 So far, the Mali community has been voting for the Congress because of Gehlot
 madanlaal saini kii niyukti ko vidhansabha chunaav ke saath hi loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaari ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 At the same time, Rajasthan BJP got its head after almost two and a half months of tug of war
 rajasthan main upachunaav main bijepi ko mili haar ke baad vasundhara raaje ke kareebi maane jane vaale ashok paranami ne party pradesh adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya tha
 Since then, no other name could be agreed
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shaahakendriya krishi rajyamantri gajendra singh shekhavat ko rajasthan bijepi kaa adhyaksh bananaa chaahate the, lekin siem vasundhara raaje isse sahamat nahin thim
 She was in favor of making Srichandra Kripalani as state president
 matbhed hone ke chalate bijepi pradesh adhyaksh pad par niyukti ko lekar kisi bhi naam par sahmati nahin ban paa rahi thi
 Due to this, the matter of appointment of party state president was hanging for the last two and a half months
 rajasthan main bijepi kii sarkaar he or is saal vidhansabha chunaav hone vaale hai
 In such a situation, it was very important for the BJP to put the face of the common man along with the caste equation
 pichley kuch samay se rajasthan main obisi samudaay vasundhara raaje sarkaar se naaraaz bataae ja rahe hai
 So BJP wanted to make them happy too
 haal hi membijapi adhyakshake saath baithak main rajasthan ke bijepi netaa saaf kaha tha ki agar shekhavat ko bijepi pradesh adhyaksh banaaya jaataa he, to aagaamee chunaav jeetna mushkil ho jayega
 These leaders believe that Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje is from Rajput community and Shekhawat also comes from Rajput community
 agar donon hi rajput samudaay se ho jaaenge, to duusari jatiyaan naaraaz ho jaaengi, jiskaa khamiyaja chunaav main bhugatna pad saktaa he
 Apart from this, the growing political activism of former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot was also causing concern for the BJP
 lihaaja bijepi ko gahalot kaa bhi tod dhundhna jaruri tha
 Given all this, the BJP had no better option than Madan Lal Saini
 madanlaal saini bhi usee mali samudaay se aate hai, jisase ashok gahalot aate hai
 The Mali community in Rajasthan has been voting for the Congress for a long time because of Gehlot
 ab madanlaal saini ke pradesh adhyaksh banane se bijepi ko congress ke paramparaagat voton main send lagane main safalataa mil sakati he
 Apart from this, Madanlal Saini comes from OBC other than Rajput and Jat community
 isse bijepi ko obisi samudaay ko bhi saadhane main madad milegi
 As soon as the BJP became the state president, Madanlal shouted as Rajya Sabha MP Madan Lal Saini shouted victory as soon as he took charge of the BJP state president
 unhone kaha ki party jo bhi jimmedaari degi, use wo nibhaayenge or chunaav main 180 seat jeetne kaa lakshya puraa karenge
 He said that we will definitely win the assembly and Lok Sabha elections
 saini bijepi kisaan morcha ke bhi pradeshdhyaksh hai
 He had won unopposed for the Rajya Sabha two months earlier

 unhone kaha ki congress na to bihar main dikhegi or na hi desh main
 Mangal Pandey told the same situation of RJD and said that there will be a break in it too soon, because the leadership of Tejashwi is not acceptable to the big leaders
 jabaki congressi netaaon ko rahul kaa netritv nahin bha rahaa he

 The demand for One Rank One Pension (OROP) is now more tense between the government and ex-servicemen
 ravivaar ko khabar ai ki sarkaar oropi kii khaamiyon ko dur karne ke liye ek ayog banane ja rahi he
 Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar may announce it in December
 lekin agle hi pal purv sainikon ne is ek sadasyeey ayog ke vichaar ko khaarij kar diya
 Told that this is a move to avoid
 purv sainikon ne kaha he ki teenon senaaon ke pramukhon kii sadsyta vaali cameti banane ke bajaay sarkaar ek sadasyeey ayog banane kii baat kar rahi he
 He was also a member made by the nomination of the Minister of Defense
 centre sarkaar ne 5 sitambar kodaushuf yojana kaa elaankia tha
 Even after this, the ex-servicemen have continued their movement
 bhootpurv sainikon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ne jo ghoshnaa kii he, vah OROP nahin, balki 'van rank, five pension' he
 What the Ex-servicemen want: The government had formally notified the OROP scheme for more than 24 lakh ex-servicemen and the wives of six lakh martyrs this month
 lekin purv sainik isse sahamat nahin hai
 - Ex-servicemen are also disallowed that junior pension should be more than senior
 iske liye unhone har do saal main pension kii samiksha karne kaa rasta sujhaayaa he
 The government wants the review to be held every 5 years
 - sarkaar ne viares lene waalon ko oropi ke daayre se baahar rakhaa he
 Former soldiers rejected this
 unka kahana he ki fouj main viares nahin, primaor ritairement hota he
 They have also demanded to implement the Pay Commission
 parrikar kah chuke-sabhi maange puri karnaa sambhav nahinisse pehle raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne kah chuke hai loktantr main sabhi ko maang uthaane kaa adhikaar he lekin sari maangon ko puraa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Earlier this month, he said that most of the demands of ex-servicemen had been met
 phir bhi yadi purv sainikon ko lagata he ki kahin koi khami rah gai he to ve sarkaar ke saamne apni baat rakhen
 Talk, but do not return the medal
 sainikon ne is maheene deshbhar main medal vaapasi abhiyaan chalaakar sarkaar par dabaav banaaya tha
 Some ex-servicemen burnt Medalis Beach, a group of ex-servicemen protesting for One Rank One Pension started burning their medals last week
 haalanki ise lekar purv sainikon main hi do dhade ho gaye
 a group of soldiers called this method of protest objectionable
 uskaa kahana tha ki ye medal raashtra ke liye die jate hai
 Burning them is an insult to the nation
 jabaki duusare samooh ne is tareeke ko jaij tehraaya he
 3 special things of OROP 1
 sarkaar kii adhisuchana ke mutabik, OROP 1 july, 2014 se hi prabhavi hoga
 Arrears to ex-servicemen will be paid in 4 half installments
 haalanki sabhi vidhwaaon ko yah raashi ek hi kist main milegi

 gujarat main haal main hue vidhansabha chunaav main congress apane sahyogiyon ke saath 80 siton par jeet hasil karne main kaamyaab rahi
 Out of these, the Congress won 77 seats on its own
 gujarat ke nateezon se utsahit timrahulisi jazbe ko banaae rakhane ke liye koi kasar nahin chhodana chaahati
 The effort is to make the image of Rahul Gandhi better in the minds of the people
 yahi vajah he ki soshal media par congress adhyaksh kii image building ko lekar sabase zyada dhyaan diya ja rahaa he
 According to party sources, the Congress has also prepared its new social media team state-wise to fight the bjp's social media army
 kuch maheenon pehle hi deependra hooda kii jagah karnataka kii abhinetri or purv saansad divya spandana urf ramya ko soshal media kaa head banaaya gaya
 After this, Divya created a new team state-wise, which tried to give a fitting reply to the BJP Army and to break the old image of Rahul
 party or khudrahulko lagata he ki, unki soshal media army apane kaam main kaaphi had tak kaamyaab rahi
 However, there were some mistakes in the josh a couple of times, but overall these mistakes were overlooked due to better work
 party kii ore se soshal media ke rajyon ke koordinators ko rahul se mulaakaat kaa mauka bhi mila
 After this, state-wise volunteers and active members requested to meet Rahul
 is guzarish ko ab rahul gandhi ne manjuuri de di he
 Rahul will tour state-wise and meet social media volunteers and members
 ye kavayad safal rahe or surkhiyaan bhi batore, iske liye rahul kii rajyon main soshal media team ke walentrs or members se mulaakaat ko rajya ke test or flavor ke hisaab se dhaala jayega
 For example, in South, he will meet Dose, who will be named 'dosa with RG'

 Amit Shah's roadshow will end through Gandhinagar constituency and Naranpura area of ahmedabad near Sardar Patel statue at Patidar Chowk
 thik isi jagah par amit shah ek badi jansabha ko sambodhit karenge
 Significantly, this is the same Patidar Chowk where the Patidars were badly beaten up during the Patidar Reservation Movement
 iske baad se yahaan kaa patidaar samudaay lagaataar amit shah kaa virodh karata rahaa he
 bjp's General Secretary, Dr
 anil jain ne kaha ki, baat patidaaron kii nahin he, yah road sho sardaar patel kii pratimaa se shuru hokar sardaar patel ki pratimaa par hi khatm hoga
 This is the land of Gandhi, Sardar Patel
 road sho ke dauraan amit shah ke saath bijepi ke kai bade netaa bhi maujuud rahenge
 Gandhinagar Lok Sabha seat has been the traditional seat of senior BJP leader LK Advani
 jahaan se wo 1998 se chunaav jitate rahe hai
 In such a situation, when the BJP General Secretary was asked if he would join this road show, Dr
 anil jain ne kaha ki laalkrishna adwani ki umr kaaphi zyada hone kii vajah se wo is tarah ke bheed vaale kaarykram main hissaa nahin lenge
 On Thursday, workers of the Gujarat BJP unit also held a rehearsal for the road show of Amit Shah

 Bhuvi had to sit on the bench in the entire test series against Australia
 unhone kaha, niyamit antaraal main aap yadi match nahin khelte hai to iskaa asar kisi bhi gendbaaj kii lay par padataa he
 i was trying to get a rhythm in the nets but the rhythm of the match is different from this

 They hope to improve further in the next match

 isliye rahul ne faisla kiya he ki agle maheene se jahaan bhi wo daura karenge vahaan ke media karmiyon se baat karenge
 Rahul has been embarking on tours of different parts of the country since October and he is starting it with Modi's Gujarat
 rahul teen or chaar oktober ko gujarat ke ahmedabad or rajkot kaa daura kar rahe hai
 In both the places Rahul will meet Congress representatives from different districts and after that he will meet the extended executive of State Congress
 in sabake baad rahul sthaneey media se donon jagah mulaakaat karenge
 On Rahul's instruction, the media and communication department has decided its full outline
 rahul iske pehle hi dilli main media se teen hisson main mulaakaat karenge
 First he will meet journalists covering the Congress
 duusare daur main beuro chif or editor se mulaakaat karenge or tisare daur main maalik or editor in chif se mulaakaat karenge
 Apparently Rahul has come to understand that without making a better connection with the media, his talk is not going to be made because the media has now got another face of Narendra Modi
 communication vibhaag ke pramukh ajay maakan ke anusaar rahul apane dauron me un sthaneey patrakaron se milanaa chaahate he jo unase bahut kam hi mil pate he
 It will be ensured that local journalists get full opportunity to meet and ask questions during these meetings
 yaad rahe ki rahul ne uttar pradesh ke chunaav main bhi isi tarah sthaneey or rashtriya media se mulaakaat kii thi lekin chunavi haar ke baad wo media se is kadar naaraaz ho gayi ki beete do saal se media se unki koi sidhi mulaakaat tak nahi hui

 com / uzwq77gpjmasia Cup: ground par dikhaa dhoni kaa gussa, kuldeep ko kaha- bowling karegaa yaa change karun In this case it is necessary to mention Jasprit Bumrah of India
 bumraah ne siries main ab tak keval do match khele he or 15 ke behtareen ausat or 27 ke strike rate se chaar wicket hasil kiye he
 Bumrah was not in the Indian team for the first two odis
 khaas baat yah he ki unhone yah chaar wicket ek hi match (pune main khele gaye tisare vanade) main hasil kiye hai
 He did not get any wickets in the fourth ODI of the series played in Mumbai
 donon tiimon kii ore se siries kaa sarvshereshth gendbaaji vishleshan (4 / 35) he
 In the final match of the series, it will be interesting to see if any bowler can beat Kuldeep in terms of wickets
 
 
 is maamle main bharat ke jasprit bumraah kaa ullekh karnaa jaruri he
 Bumrah has played only two matches in the series so far and has taken four wickets at an average of 15 and a strike rate of 27
 bumraah pehle do vanade maichon kii bhartiya team main shaamil nahin the
 The special thing is that he has got these four wickets in a single match (3rd ODI played in Pune)
 mumbai main khele gaye siries ke chauthe vanade main unhen koi wicket nahin mila tha
 Both teams have the best bowling analysis of the series (4 / 35)
 siries ke antim match main yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki viketon ke maamle main koi gendbaaj kuldeep ko peeche chhod paata he yaa nahin

 Add 122 runs at an average of 7
 rohit ne kaha, mere liye krij par tikna jaruri tha, khaskar tab jab ham kai wicket ganvaa chuke the
 We knew the Melbourne pitch would be a little slow and low, so i wanted to take all my time
 mujhe pataa tha ki yadi main 35 overon tak tikaa rah paaya to kuch acha hoga

 Australia's Defense Minister Kevin Andrews faced embarrassment when he could not name the head of terrorist organization Islamic State (IS) on a very special occasion
 baat us din kii he, jab unhone jihadi sanghathan ko haraane ke liye or adhik bal bhejne kii patibaddhta jataai thi
 The Australian Broadcasting Corporation asked Kevin Andrews about the IS chief during an interview aired on television late last night
 abu bakar al bagdadi ko IS pramukh mana jaataa he
 But Andrews continued to avoid giving direct answers to this question
 kevin andrews ne kaha, 'main oparational maamalon main spasht rup se nahin jaaunga
 The woman interviewed said, "I don't think it's an operational matter
" mujhe lagata he ki yah saarvajanik record kaa maamla he
 The woman said, 'minister, you are responsible for putting Australian women and men on the path of danger through this campaign
 mujhe hairaani he ki aap mujhe islamic state ke netaa kaa naam nahin bataa sakate
 "he said," The US State Department has placed a million dollar prize on his head
 andrews ne kaha, 'islamic state sanghathanon kaa samooh he
 There is no one person involved in this

 'andrews later tweeted,' Focusing on the individual ignores the current threat of radical organization
 'IS pramukh kaa naam lene se inkaar karne ke bare main australian media kaa maananaa he ki andrews ko yah pataa hi nahin he ki bagdadi koun he
 Hours earlier, he announced jointly with Prime Minister Tony Abbott that 330 non-combat troops were going to Iraq for two years, where they would train local soldiers to fight jihadists, including the Islamic State

 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke duusare charan kaa matdaan khatm hone se do din pehle, 12 disambar ko, bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah aatmavishvaas se labalab the
 Shah, sitting on the couch in the party's huge headquarters "kamalam" on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, said, "we are impossible to defeat in Gujarat and that too when we have a leader like Modi and who is our election mascot
" "shah ne rajya main party kii gahari jadon kii baat kii or 130 se zyada siten jeetne kii bhavishyavaanee kii
 When the results started coming one by one on the morning of 18 December, Shah proved to be right, but only to an extent
 modi-shah kii jodi ne apane khilaaf morche par date vipaksh kii dhar ko vaaki bhothra kar diya or lagaataar chhathi jeet hasil kii, jo pashchim bengal main vam morche kii lagaataar saat jeeton se mahaj ek kam he, magar ve kisi tarah jeet kii lakeer ko bas paar bhar kar sake
 The party bagged a total of 99 seats, which was just seven more than the seats required for a simple majority, but only 19 more than the 80 seats in the Congress and its allies
 bhaajapa ne 49
 Gained 1 per cent of the votes, which is one percentage point more than the votes he got in 2012, but lost 16 seats
 vahiin vot hissedari main mahaj teen fisadi ankon kii badhotaree ke saath congress kii siton main 16 siton kaa ijapha hua, jo 1985 ke baad uskaa behtareen pradarshan he
 Of the 16 seats the BJP lost, most lost seats because its disillusioned supporters chose the option of "none of the above" or "nota" (added to the evms in 2015)
 in sabhi siton par nota kaa batan dabaane vaale matadaataaon kii taadaad bhaajapa kii haar ke antar se zyada thi
 For example, in Modasa in north Gujarat, BJP lost by 200 votes, while NOTA got 3,515 votes
 lihaaja, agar in 16 siton par ye kul 5,51,615 matadaata voting mashin par nota kii bajaae panje kaa batan dabaa dete, to 22 saal main pehali baar bhaajapa aaj vipaksh main baithi hoti
 Yet this is not the only evidence that shows how tough the BJP faced in Gujarat this time
 patidaar andolan ne party ko patelon ke dabadabe vaale saurashtra-kuccha ilaake main khaasi chot pahunchaai, jahaan vah 54 main se mahaj 23 siten hi jeet saki (jabaki 2012 main usne 35 siten jiti thim)
 She was able to overcome her destiny in the four big cities of the state — Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot — because of the way the BJP pounced
 in shaharon kii 55 main se 46 siten bhaajapa kii jholii main gayi, jabaki baaki 127 siton main se vah sirf 53 jeet saki or inamen se 71 siten congress ne hasil kin
 If the BJP had not done so well in these four cities, it would have lost Gujarat
 haalanki bhaajapa kii gramin chunauti vikat he
 In seven of the 33 districts of the state, BJP could not win a single seat and in each of the other eight districts, it had to win just one seat each

 Looking at these winning figures according to the assembly constituencies, the probability of winning 165 seats was raised
 uske voton kaa chhitrana tab shuru hua jab notebandi or jiesti ke judawaan nattejey hindustan ke is sabase awwal audyogic soobe main dikhaai dene lage or vot hissedari main yah giravat chalati rahi
 According to a reputed public opinion poll, the difference in votes between Congress and BJP came down to just 6 per cent before the election

 This movement created a charismatic youth leader like Hardik Patel, who braved the arrests and sex tapes bravely and instigated a tremendous sentiment against the BJP
 una or uske baad daliton par hue hamalon ne jignesh mewaani ke falak par ubharne kaa rasta saaf kar diya
 With this, the general perception of dictatorship in bjp's attitude, the deep crisis of farming and farming and the impact of GST made it clear that Gujarat was not going to prove to be a flower bed for BJP

 Surprised - Modi and Shah held two meetings and discussed the strategy
 ek bhaajapa netaa kehete hai, ''pradhanmantri chaahate the ki vikaas hindustan kii chunavi raajnneeti kaa mukhya aadhaar ho
 "efforts to overcome the damage began in October
 aktubar or november main jiesti parishad ne 178 chizon ko 28 fisadi se hataakar 18 fisadi kar dar main laane kaa elaan kiya
 Shah himself set up tents in Gujarat from mid-november
 ve ''kamalam" se kaam karne lage or party ke booth prabandhan tathaa vigyaapan ranneeti ko unhone nijee taur par khud sambhaal liya
 He used the visual aid strategy in close coordination with Modi every day — almost as long as he stayed in Gujarat, making a phone call to the Prime Minister every morning and a phone call in the evening
 is jodi ne jo ranneeti tay kii, usamen bhaajapa ke rajkaaj par jor diya gaya or logon ko desh ke har ghar main pehali baar choubees ghanton bijli muhaiyaa karne sareekhe prayogon kii yaad dilaai gai
 Shah changed Modi's new slogan - "hoon Choo Vikas, Hoon Choo Gujarat (main Hoon Vikas, Main Hoon Gujarat)" into a promotional strategy
 is jodi ko laga ki yah sakaaratmak campan khaskar rajya ke asardaar enarai logon main gujarati asmita ke jazbe ko jagayegaa
 The campaign revolved around a series of short four-minute videos of Movingpixel
 isane gujarati gaurav kii bhaavana ko jagaaya or us nakaaratmak muhim ko bhothra kiya jo hardik or congress ne ched rakhi thi
 The five short films showed that one of the main characters questioned the bjp's claims about development, and others responded to it by turshi-by-turshi, ending with the claim that "I love my Gujarati Proud to be "aakhirkaar congress ne bhi nakaaratmak campan se tauba kar lee
 But he did so much so that Gujarati film actor Hitu Kanodia, who played the role of a hero in one of these films, which got 1 crore views in a single day, won the election on a BJP ticket
 chunaav ke aakhri daur main modi ne jabardast abhiyaan chalaaya
 Starting on November 27 and 34 rallies across the state, Bhumiputra's emotional appeal showed Wabasta a winning streak after the campaign
 modi ne congress netaa manishankar ayyar kii ''neech" tippanee ko khaasi kamyaabi ke saath buumarang main badal diya, supreme court se ayodhya kaa faisla 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav tak multavee karne ko kehane ke liye kapil sibbal par joardaar hamalaa bolaa or yahaan tak ki ayyar ke ghar par ek bhoj main shaamil hone ke liye, jisamen pakistan ke purv videsh mantri khurshid mahmud kasuri sahit pakistani afasar bhi maujuud the, purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya
 Modi shouted at his rallies, "has the Congress given the Pakistanis the ability to remove me?"; "can a" low "not become Prime Minister?" If these roars don't happen, the party loses this election Could have congress ne booth ranneeti taiyaar karne ke daawey to kiye the, par unke baavjood vah shah kii bilkul anuthi maidani chunavi mashinari ke pasang bhi sabit nahin ho saki
 On both days of the 9 and 18 December polling, BJP workers continued to make frequent rounds of voters' homes from the electoral booths and carried out Shah's instruction to get their committed voters to the polling booth
 duusari taraf congress ke booth, yahaan tak ki surat main patel-bahul varacha ilaake sareekhe party ke majboot kile bhi, yaa to suune pade the yaa bilkul khaali the
 Shah's electoral booth management strategy increased bjp's vote share by one percentage point, despite its 2012 total vote share of 68
 7 fisadi se 2
 Came down 6 percent
 rajnatik vishleshak jagan pathak ise bina shart ''modi kii kadi mehnat or hunarmand prachaar muhim or shah ke booth management" kii jeet qaraar dete hai
 Another setback for the Congress is the elimination of its top leaders in the elections
 teen dashakon main apane behtareen pradarshan ke baavjood uske tamaam bade netaa—shaktisingh gohil, arjuna modhwadiya, siddharth patel or tushaar choudhary—haar gaye
 In contrast, top BJP ministers including Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel managed to save themselves in this electoral storm
 haalanki saat mantri chunaav haare, jinamein bijli mantri chiman sapaaria or swasthya mantri shankarabhai choudhary bhi shaamil hai
 The modi-shah duo apparently managed to convince voters that they made all the minor mistakes and omissions, but the BJP is still the best bet for them
 shaharon ke voting pattern se pataa chalata he ki jiesti main kiye gaye sudhaaron ne bhaajapa ko ho rahe nuksaan ko thama
 In both North and South Gujarat, where the party won 15 and 35 seats respectively, it managed to get closer to the seats it had won in 2012
 patidaar andolan kaa asar saurashtra tak simit rahaa or duusare kshetron ke patel-bahul ilaakon tak nahin failaa
 Out of the total 52 seats accumulated, where the Patidar population is more than 15 percent, BJP won 32 seats and Congress 20
 alabatta obisi, jin par bhaajapa ne ummiden tikaa rakhi thim, ek had tak uske paale main aae
 In the urban-rural divide — in which the urban went to the BJP and in favor of the rural Congress — the trend of earlier elections was visible
 yah sabase zyada saurashtra—kuccha main jaahir hua
 While the Congress got the benefit of Patel votes in its favor, the urban votes saved the BJP from sinking
 bhaajapa ko is sitambar main congress netaa ahamed patel ko haraane ke liye kiye gaye daanvpechon kii bhi keemat chukaani padi
 She brought 13 Congress mlas into her court, but could not prevent Patel from being re-elected to the Rajya Sabha

 Amul Dairy Cooperative's powerful president Ram Singh Parmar also lost
 matadaataaon kaa sandesh saaf thah dalbadal kii raajnneeti bardaasht nahin kii jaaegi
 The BJP also had to pay for its shortcomings on the economic front
 diwaali ke pehle moongfalee or kapaas kii paidaavaar ke liye jo samarthan mulya ghoshit kiya gaya, vah khaasaa kam tha
 He contributed significantly in aggravating the farming crisis
 alabatta, isi ke saath centre or rajya sarkaron kii kuch ini-gini yojanaon ne party ko baari phayda pahunchaaya
 Under the Mudra Scheme, 28 lakh small professionals and entrepreneurs like Gujarat's carpenters, blacksmiths, grocery shoppers were given unsecured loans
 ujjwala yojana main gujarat ke 13 lakh garib pariwaron ko saste dar par rasoi gas kii kit mili
 The unique service bridge program of the Indian minister Vijay Rupani — in which the government went to the doorsteps of the poor to benefit the schemes — may also have had an impact
 bhaajapa kii rashtriya mahasachiv saroj pandeya ise sateek dhang se bayaan karti hai, ''rajya main 22 saal kii anti-inakambency ke baad bhi ham sarkaar bana rahe hai, yah koi choti baat nahin he
 It is clear that Prime Minister Modi's appeal is unbeatable
 agar hamane koi keemat chukaai, to vah vikaas kii raajnneeti par tike rahane kii or congress ke jati or alpsankhyak tushtikaran kii nakaaratmak raajnneeti khilne kii keemat thi
 "the imminent challenge of the victory has not diminished the bjp's concerns in Gujarat at all
 krishi sankat, patelon ko obisi ke taur par aarakshan ke liye jor dene vaale pieees andolan ne, jise hardik patel ne jari rakhane kaa sankalp liya he, or alpesh or jignesh jaise yuva netaaon ke vidhansabha main pravesh jaise muddon ne party kii chunautiyon main vruddhi hi kii he
 The leadership left vacant after Modi's departure at the national level in 2014 has been filled by new leaders like Hardik
 unhen chunauti dene ke liye nai nirvaachit sarkaar se ek shashakt, nirnaayak netritv kii apeksha kii jaati he
 If the BJP actually retains Rupani, then he will have to end his hesitation and be more vocal in dealing with the bureaucracy, though his image has been clean and his relations with party workers are perfectly fine
 nai sarkaar ko matadaataaon ko bhi lubhaana hoga, vishesh rup se yuvaaon or kisaanon ko, jinhone is chunaav main congress ko vot diya he
 The new government will need to bring back veterans like former state minister for industry and power Saurabh Patel, who was ousted by Rupani after a 14-year tenure in the ministry
 pehali chunauti agle saal april main pesh aegi, jab gujarat ke chaar rajyasabha saansadon kaa kaarykaal samaapt hoga
 These include Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Union Minister of State for Road and Surface Transport Mansukh Mandaviya, Union Minister of State for Agriculture, Farmers Welfare, Panchayati Raj Purushottam Rupala and Shankarbhai Vegad
 bhaajapa kii do siten pakki hai, lekin congress kii sankhya main badhotaree se do anya siton ke liye kathin sangharsh bhi pakkaa ho gaya he
 After this, all the 26 seats won by riding on the Modi wave in 2014 will face a huge challenge to retain
 ahmedabad ke ek varisht patrkaar or rajnatik vishleshak ajay umat kehete hai, ''bhaajapa ko jadta se nikalnaa hoga or 2019 kii chunauti kaa muqabla karne ke liye sarkaar or party, donon main parivartanon kii jhadi lagaani hogi
 "to strengthen its credibility, the new government will need to deal with basically five major issues
 use kisaanon ko raahat dene ke upayon ko lagu karnaa hoga
 The Rupani government for the cotton and groundnut crop which was Rs 900
 kaa nunatam samarthan mulya ghoshit kiya tha, vah kisaanon kii 1,300 ru
 Is below expectations
 agali fasal ke liye samarthan mulya main vruddhi kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Poor implementation of the crop insurance scheme will also have to be corrected and the system of delivery underpinned
 haalanki, nai sarkaar ke saamne sabase badi chunauti patidaar andolan ko shant karne kii hogi
 In 2016, Hardik rejected the offer of reservation for economically backward among the forward castes
 sarkari adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki ek sambhav samaadhaan hardik sahit sabhi patidaar andolankariyon ke khilaaf maamalon ko bina shart waapas lenaa ho saktaa he
 Soon after the election victory, Jignesh held a meeting with Hardik to formulate a joint strategy to surround the BJP
 uttari gujarat ke daliton par jignesh kii pakad ne is kshetra main kuch mahatvapurn ummidavaaron kii haar main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Jignesh may prove to be a headache for the BJP after becoming an MLA, as he has not won the Vadgam seat only because of Dalits; He is also heavily supported by Muslims
 party ko gujarat main ek vishwasaneey or prabhavi netritv kaa nirmaan bhi karnaa hoga
 One reason for the BJP losing many seats is that it again fielded old, tired mlas
 bhaajapa ne kam se kam teen honhaar netaaon—amit thaakar, 45 varsh; bharat pandya, 50 varsh; or jigar inaamdaar, 40 varsh—kii kathith taur par bhai-bhatijawad ke kaaran andekhi kii
 For example, Pandya and Thakar are not being trusted because they were close to Sanjay Joshi, once a rival of Modi
 duusari ore inaamdaar rajya netritv ke ek varg kii uljhan main funs gaye
 The BJP also needs a young leadership in Gujarat to face the challenge of the hardik-alpesh-jignesh trio
 iske alaava 80 siton par jeet hasil karne ke baad congress kaa nayaa netritv apane tevar or aakraamak hi karegaa
 The Congress is already considering three names for the post of Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly
 inamen amarelli ke sakriy vidhayak paresh dhahni (41 varsh) hai, jo saurashtra main patel samudaay main ek bada naam hai or rahul gandhi ke kareebi hai
 There is a 62-year-old Kunwarji Bavaliya, a senior Koli leader from Saurashtra, who is known for his rapport with his followers and voters

 Third name is 60-year-old Dr

 After this, when the police team arrived, they attacked the team and escaped with three children

 pehle in bacchon ne sthaneey logon ko bachaao-bachaao kahkar icttha kiya, jiske kaaran afawaah fail gai kii yahaan bacchon ko gair kanoonee tareeqe se band kar rakhaa ja rahaa hai
 After this the local people evacuated the children from there
 iske baad police ko bulaayaa gaya, lekin police ke aate hi sthaneey log ugr ho gaye or unki gaadi par patharav karne lage
 The operators of this children's home say that on Tuesday evening, six children were brought who were making a ruckus since night
 phir unhone ronaa shuru kar diya, jisase sthaneey logon ko kuch galat he iskaa shaq hua
 They felt that the children were being tortured
 haalanki, is maamle main teen logon ko hiraasat main liya gaya he or gaayab bacchon ko baraamad karne ke liye police chhapemari kar rahi he

 This battle between the government and Team Anna is not new
 dekhnaa he ab team anna kya jawaab detii he
 The letter said that while Team Anna talks a lot of morality, while accusing Pranab Mukherjee, he did not say that the public interest litigation related to this is going on in the High Court
 or supreme court main isse judi janhit yachika pehle hi waapas le lee gai he
 Prashant Bhushan has been a lawyer in this case from the beginning, but now he wants to achieve what he has not been able to do legally in this case in a non-judicial manner

 Now see what Team Anna answers

 a student and her accomplice were arrested for the murder of a financier

 a police officer told about this on Saturday

 He was arrested from Honda Chowk in the early hours of Saturday

 The matter came to light on Thursday when Roshan Lal's bullet-riddled body was found in a flat in Sector 103 here
 gudgaanv police ke piaaro subhash bokan ne kaha, ‘‘jab jaanch adhikariyon ne laal ke bete rahul ko hatya ke bare main bataaya to usne police ko bataaya ki laal 31 oktober ko jhajjar main apane karyaalay gaye the

 During the investigation, the accused told the police that they knew Lal through some friends
 laal ne vittiya rup se unki madad kii or unhone kuch dhan phogot ko die jise vah nahin lautaa paayi
 Asked to return the money, he conspired to eliminate Lal
 iske baad vah vikram ke saath laal ko jhajjar se gudgaanv le gayi
 He then drank in a flat and was shot when Lal was completely drunk

 Wake up, be careful, save your beloved, keep an eye on your beloved
 ye mahaj guzarish nahin he balki har maa-baap ke liye hidaayat he
 Especially for the parents who live in the metropolis and both do jobs
 kyonki dilli or mumbai jaise mahanagaron main punap rahe hai kam umr ke pyaar
 Physical relationships are being formed at an early age
 ho rahi hai kam umr main ladkiyaan pregnant
 This shocking disclosure is for every parent
 kya aapako pataa he ki is vaqt aapaki beti kya kar rahi he? aapaki beti kahaan he? wo kab kahaan jaati he? wo kab kisase milti he? agar nahin to foran pataa kiijie isse pehle ki bahut der ho jaae
 Would you believe that children are having physical relationships in their childhood in Delhi? 30 percent of 10th-12th children lose their virginity in school? Take a look at some figures
 dilli main 10veen or 12veen kii 30 fisadi ladkiyaan bana leti hai shaareerik sambandh
 Losing virility in childhood, physical relationships are being formed in childhood, many partners at the age of 16
 12 saal kii ladakiyon main bhi trend shuru
 30% increase in pregnancy of girls studying in Delhi
 ye aankade daraavne hai
 Sadly it is true
 ek aisa sach jo hajaaron-lakhon maa-baap kii neend uda de
 The figures are of course Delhi but parents living in other cities also do not close their eyes to this truth
 kya pataa aapke bachche bhi aapako dhokhaa de rahe hon?kam umr main jismani rishte
 This disclosure is therefore dangerous
 kyonki ye aakajak dilli ke bade-bade aspataalon ke doctoron kaa he
 In the last few days, the number of children coming to the doctors has increased rapidly, which brings about the problem of physical relations
 vaise to europea deshon se aisi khabaren baar-baar aati rahi hai, chaunkaati rahi hai
 In the year 2007, Durex Global Survey showed that the age of sexual relations is decreasing continuously in the world
 is survey main kaha gaya tha ki ireland main ye umr 15 saal se bhi kam he
 Whereas, on average, girls make physical relationships in 17 years worldwide
 2007 ke is survey main hindustan main ye umr ausatan 21 saal thi
 But in the last 4 years everything has changed, as well as the young generation of India
 ek tazaa aankade ke mutabik desh ke andar dilli main halaat sabase zyada kharaab hai
 These figures are based on the number of young girls arriving in different hospitals and clinics in Delhi
 aankadon ke mutabik dilli ke tin-agers europea deshon ke tin-agers kii tarah hi 12 se 16 saal kii umr main hi jismani rishte bana rahi hai
 That is, their virginity is ending in school itself
 cese study ke mutabik skulon main padhane vaali kareeb tees fisadi ladkiyaan 16 saal se pehle hi jismani rishta bana chuki hoti hai
 These figures are also surprising because they are derived from a case study, not on a survey
 haal ke vakt main dilli ke bade aspataalon main pahunchane vaali kam umr kii aisi ladakiyon kii taadaad badi he jo sex kii samasyaon ko lekar pahunchati hai
 These girls are bonding at an early age without thinking
 college main jane vaali zyaadaatar ladkiyaan sexuali active hai, jo maamle ham dekh rahe hai unamem ye kahana galat nahin he ki 18 se 20 saal kii 80 se 90 fisadi ladkiyaan sexuali active hai or unke multiple byayafriend hai
 It does not end here
 khatara or bhi bada he kyonki 16-18 saal kii ladakiyon kii dekha-dekhi kam umr kii ladkiyaan bhi ab usee raste par chal padi hai
 According to experts, 12-13 year old girls studying in Delhi schools have also joined this blind race

 parrikar ne kaha, "ek lokapriy edlt film thi
 i was an adult at that time

 During the interval, when the light lit up, i realized that my neighbor was sitting next to me
 yah padosi aksar meri maa ke saath shaam ko baat karata tha
 i told myself that we were killed
 "goa ke siem parrikarne kaha ki wo or unka bhai avadhoot film bich hi main chhodkar cinemahol se bhaage
 On the way home, he had already made plans to deal with the crisis
 unhone kaha, "jab ham ghar pahunche to maine apni maa se kaha ki ham film dekhne gaye the or ham nahin jaanate the ki film ashleel he
 We left the film in the middle
 maine bahut hi sahaj rup se unhen bataaya ki hamaare padosi bhi vahaan the or main chup ho gaya
 "he said," The next day our neighbor excitedly called our mother and said that Manohar and Avadhoot went to see the adult film
 meri maa ne unase kaha ki main jaanati hum ki wo koun-si film dekhne gaye the, lekin aap kyon wo film dekhne gaye the? aapako kuch chijen pehle se sochni hongi

 In the country where hours of TV events are blown in the name of cleanliness, crores of people are blown to write slogans on walls
 aakhir ham kya nahin kar sake ki siver kii safai karte vakt kisi kii jaan na jaae
 What did we get apart from publicity by taking a broom in clean and clean places in the name of cleanliness if we did not control the death caused by cleaning the sewer
 har maut kii alag alag kahani he magar kaaran ek he
 We respect the political gimmick of the scavengers by descending into the sewer but do not take care of their safety
 siver main safai karne waalon ko na to suraksha ke upkaran milte hai or na unki khaas training
 By when will the sewer be cleaned, is this the only way left? kam se kam swatchta ke naam par jo abhiyaan chalate hai usee ke tahat inhen upkaran milte or training milti, or phir photun khichataa or jiskaa ri-twit hota
 Ten-year-old Gaurav is photographing his father
 patr likh rahaa he ki nai cycle kaa vaada kaise puraa karenge
 Her father Anil died of suffocation while cleaning the sewer in Dwarka
 jo rassi di gai wo majboot nahin thi
 Broke and he died
 vah 20 feet gahare siver main dub gaya
 Gaurav also has a sister
 udai foundation se unki yah haalat nahin dekhi gai
 Anil's family did not have much money
 is khabar ko dekhne ke baad rahul verma ne croud funding ke zarie logon se madad maangi

 Rahul Verma has tweeted that all the money will be fixed fixed, the money that will come from its interest will teach Gaurav
 18 saal hone par use wo sara paisa mil jayega jisase wo aage kii zindagi kaa faisla kar sake
 Rahul Verma said that if people had not done this work then it could have been that poverty would have taken Gaurav towards his father's work
 kaash system rahul verma kii tarah sakriy hota to yah naubat hi nahin aati
 The message is that people will help together, they do not back down, but until this problem is resolved, there will be no system, we will not be able to stop the deaths from emotional suffocation
 supreme court kaa aadesh bhi he ki siver kii safai karte vakt kisi kii maut hogi to sarkaar 10 lakh degi
 Does everyone get this amount of one million? jabaki 2014 main hi supreme court ne aadesh diya tha or kaha tha ki 1993 se jitne log mare hai un sabko das das lakh die jaaen
 What was given is also a question
 inhen sab sandesh ko lekar safai karmchaaree andolan ke bazewada wilson or unke saathiyon ne itio par pradarshan kiya
 The Supreme Court order is that it is a crime to go to the sewer without any safety measures, equipment and clothes, no matter how emergency occurs
 koi majaboor nahin kar saktaa he
 Even after this, such incidents have not reduced
 magar sabake aankade alag alag hai
 The Safai Karmachari Andolan says that between 2016 and 2018 in Delhi, 429 people died due to sewer work
 isi saal ab tak 83 logon kii siver main kaam karne se maut hui jinamein se chah ne beete ek hafte main hi jaan ganvaai
 On the other hand, according to the National Cleanliness Commission (NCSK), since January 2017, only 123 sanitation workers across the country have lost their lives
 iske aankade zyaadaatar akhbaaron kii reports ke aadhaar par hai
 According to this, 96 people died in 2017 and 13 in 2018 due to sewer cleaning
 tippaniyan Statistics from 2017 to date show that one man dies every five days
 indian express kii shalini nair kii report chhapi he jinhen ladli media award bhi mila he
 The problem is why people are hired on contract to clean the manhole
 kyon nagarpalikaayen inkaa record rakhti hai
 How many employees are there and how many have died
 janvari 2015 main brihanmumbai nagarpalika ne bataaya tha ki pichley chah saal main yani 2009 se 2015 ke bich 1386 safai karmiyon kii maut ho gai he or yah sankhya badhati hi ja rahi he

 80 percent of sewer cleaners do not reach the retirement age

 jis desh main swatchta ke naam par ghanto tivi ke event phoonk die jate hon, jagah jagah deevaaron par naare likhane ke liye karodon phoonk die jate hai
 After all, what we could not do was that nobody should die while cleaning the sewer
 swatchta ke naam par saaf suthri jagahon par jhaadu chalaakar photo khinchaa lene se hamen prachaar ke alaava kya mila agar hamane siver kii safai karte vakt hone vaali maut ko kaabo nahin kiya
 Every death has a different story but the reason is one
 ham siver main utar kar safai karne waalon kii raajnneetik nautanki ke liye to sammaan karte hai magar unki suraksha kaa khyaal nahin karte hai
 The sewer sweepers do not receive any safety equipment nor their special training
 kab tak siver main utar kar safai hogi, kya yahi ek tarika bachaa he
 At least in the name of cleanliness, under the campaign, they would get equipment and training, and then take photos and re-tweet
 das saal kaa gaurav apane pita kii tasviir bana rahaa he
 The letter is writing how they will fulfill the promise of new bicycle

 The rope given was not strong
 tut gai or vah mar gaya
 He drowned in a sewer 20 feet deep
 gaurav kii ek bahan bhi he
 This condition was not seen from the Uday Foundation
 anil ke parivaar ke paas atyeshti ke bhi paise nahin the
 After watching this news, Rahul Verma sought help from people through crowd funding
 sarkaar or system se zyaada aam log tezi se saamne aa gaye
 He could not return to Gaurav's father, but did fulfill his father's promise
 gaurav ke paas nai cycle pahunch gai
 Within a few hours people deposited more than 3 million money from their pocket
 rahul verma ne twit kiya he ki saare paise ko fiks deposit kiya jayega, iske interest se jo paisa aayega usase gaurav kii padhai hogi
 At 18, he will get all the money so that he can decide his future life
 rahul verma ne kaha ki agar logon ne yah kaam nahin kiya hota to ho saktaa tha ki garibi gaurav ko apane pita ke kaam kii ore le jaati
 i wish the system would be active like Rahul Verma, then it would not come
 messej yahi he ki log to milakar madad kar denge, ve peeche nahin hatate hai lekin jab tak is samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin hoga, vyavastha nahin hoga ham bhavukta se dam ghutane se hone vaali mauton ko roak nahin paaenge
 The Supreme Court also orders that if someone dies while cleaning the sewer, the government will give 10 lakh
 kya har kisi ko das lakh kii yah raashi mil jaati he
 Whereas in 2014, the Supreme Court had ordered and said that all those who have died since 1993 should be given ten lakhs
 kya die gaye, yah bhi ek sawaal he
 With this message, Bezwada Wilson and his colleagues of the Safai Karmachari Andolan demonstrated on the ITO
 baqayda supreme court kaa aadesh he ki kitni bhi apaat sthiti ho, bina suraksha upaay, upkarnon or vastron ke siver main janaa aparaadh he
 Nobody can force it
 iske baad bhi aisi ghatnaayen kam nahin hui hai
 But everyone's figures are different
 safai karmchaaree andolan kaa kahana he ki dilli main 2016 se 2018 ke bich siver main kaam karne se 429 logon kii maut hui he
 So far this year, 83 people died due to working in the sewer, out of which six lost their lives in the last one week
 udhar rashtriya safaai karmchaaree ayog (NCSK) ke mutabik janvari 2017 se ab tak desh bhar main sirf 123 safaai mazaduron ne apni jaan ganvaai he
 Its figures are mostly based on newspaper reports
 iske mutabik 2017 main 96 logon or 2018 main 13 logon kii siver kii safaai kii vajah se maut hui
 The comments 2017 se ab tak ke aankade bataate hai ki har paanch din main ek aadmi kii maut hoti he
 The Indian Express has published a report by Shalini Nair, who has also received the Ladli Media Award
 samasya yah he ki manhole saaf karne ke liye theke par hi log kyon rakhe jate hai
 Why municipalities keep a record of these kitne karmchaaree hai or kitnon kii maut hui he
 In January 2015, the Brihanmumbai Municipality had reported that 1386 sanitation workers have died in the last six years i
e
 between 2009 and 2015 and this number is increasing
 prexis naam kii sanstha ne ek report banaai thi 'down di dren'
 After studying 200 sewer cleaners in this report, Dr
 ashish mittal ne bataaya tha ki agar hidrogen sulphide kii maatra adhik he to ek baar saans lene se hi maut ho jaaegi
 The pattern of death is such that three die simultaneously
 ek jab nahin aata he to doosraa jaataa he use dekhne teesraa jaataa he
 a junior engineer has also died in Delhi
 80 fisadi siver saaf karne vaale ritairement age tak nahin pahunch pate hai
 Many diseases surround them and they die prematurely
 isiilie aap dekhte hai ki ek saath chaar yaa paanch log maar jate hai
 Every death has a different story but the reason is one
 ham siver main utar kar safai karne waalon kii raajnneetik nautanki ke liye to sammaan karte hai magar unki suraksha kaa khyaal nahin karte hai
 The sewer sweepers do not receive any safety equipment nor their special training
 kab tak siver main utar kar safai hogi, kya yahi ek tarika bachaa he

 rahul verma ne twit kiya he ki saare paise ko fiks deposit kiya jayega, iske interest se jo paisa aayega usase gaurav kii padhai hogi
 At 18, he will get all the money so that he can decide his future life
 rahul verma ne kaha ki agar logon ne yah kaam nahin kiya hota to ho saktaa tha ki garibi gaurav ko apane pita ke kaam kii ore le jaati
 i wish the system would be active like Rahul Verma, then it would not come
 messej yahi he ki log to milakar madad kar denge, ve peeche nahin hatate hai lekin jab tak is samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin hoga, vyavastha nahin hoga ham bhavukta se dam ghutane se hone vaali mauton ko roak nahin paaenge

 With this message, Bezwada Wilson and his colleagues of the Safai Karmachari Andolan demonstrated on the ITO

 The comments 2017 se ab tak ke aankade bataate hai ki har paanch din main ek aadmi kii maut hoti he
 The Indian Express has published a report by Shalini Nair, who has also received the Ladli Media Award

 Her father Anil died of suffocation while cleaning the sewer in Dwarka
 jo rassi di gai wo majboot nahin thi
 Broke and he died

 Gaurav also has a sister
 udai foundation se unki yah haalat nahin dekhi gai

 Rahul Verma said that if people had not done this work then it could have been that poverty would have taken Gaurav towards his father's work
 kaash system rahul verma kii tarah sakriy hota to yah naubat hi nahin aati
 The message is that people will help together, they do not back down, but until this problem is resolved, there will be no system, we will not be able to stop the deaths from emotional suffocation
 supreme court kaa aadesh bhi he ki siver kii safai karte vakt kisi kii maut hogi to sarkaar 10 lakh degi

 So Kejriwal's second attack opened up a scandal of BJP President Nitin Gadkari

 Former Pakistani captain Zaheer Abbas is happy with the resumption of the bilateral cricket series between India and Pakistan, but feels the series should have been longer
 jahir ne saakshaatkaar main kaha, yah acchhee baat he ki aakhir main paanch saal baad dwipaksheeya cricket match shuru hone ja rahe hai, lekin bharat-paak cricket muqablon ke mahatv ko dekhte hue shrunkhlaa kii avadhi ke kaaran main niraash hum
 The comments unhone kaha, kisi bhi tarah kii dwipaksheeya shrunkhlaa swaagat yogya he, lekin meraa maananaa he ki itane lambey samay ke baad donon deshon ko test shrunkhlaa khelni chahie thi or apane vyast kaarykram ke bich iske liye samay nikaalnaa chahie tha
 Zaheer said, but i hope soon both boards will decide the schedule of the full-time Test series, because we have not played Test matches against each other for a long time
 cricket kii asli chunauti test cricket main he
 Another former captain Hanif Mohammad also welcomed the pcb's decision to send the team to India
 unhone kaha, yah acha faisla he
 Although India has not visited Pakistan since 2006, but someone had to take the initiative and it is good that we did, because i believe that indo-pak competition will increase the popularity of this game in the subcontinent

 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut's attack on BJP said in the newspaper - bjp's CM is still in political circles in Maharashtra
 bijepi-shivasena kii dosti main daraar saaf najar aa rahi he
 In such a situation, the cm's chair will go to whose court it is not clear
 haalanki rajyapal bi
 s
 koshyari ne shanivaar shaam bijepi ko sarkaar banane ke liye aamantrit kiya or poocha ki kya vah isaki icchhuk or isamen sakasham he? vahiin, shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne phir bijepi par hamalaa bolaa he
 In the Saamna article Roktok, Sanjay Raut has compared the BJP to Hitler
 unhone kaha ki paanch saal dusron ko dar dikhaakar shashan karne vaali toli aaj khud khaufjada he
 This is the reverse attack
 daraakar maarg or samarthan nahin miltaa he, aisa jab hota he tab ek baat sweekaar kerani chahie ki hitler mar gaya he or gulaami kii chaaya hat gai he
 The police and other investigative agencies should work in front of it fearlessly
 is parinaam kaa yahi arth he
 Maharashtra is not a slave of Delhi
 
 
 sanjay raut ne likhaa he ki maharashtra kii raajnneeti maharashtra main hi ho
 Maharashtra is not a slave of Delhi
 pradhanmantri modi ne mukhyamantri fadanvis kii saraahna kii
 Fadnavis would be the chief minister again, gave such a blessing, but even after 15 days, Fadnavis could not take the oath as Amit Shah remained obsessed with the events of the state
 ‘yuti’ kii sabase badi party shivasena dhalate hue mukhyamantri se baat karne ko taiyaar nahin he
 This is the biggest defeat
 isliye dilli kaa aashirwad milane ke baad bhi ghode par baithne ko nahin mila
 CM of BJP should not be there
 
 
 
 Sanjay Raut wrote that the situation is such that who will be the Chief Minister of Maharashtra this time? These will decide Uddhav Thackeray
 rajya ke bade netaa sharad pavaar kii bhoomika mahatvapurn sabit hogi or congress ke kai vidhayak sonia gandhi se milakar aae hai
 He has also told Sonia Gandhi that the Maharashtra decision should be handed over to Maharashtra
 kuch bhi ho lekin dobaaraa bhaajapa kaa mukhyamantri na ho, yah maharashtra kaa ekamukhi sur he
 Maharashtra's air should not deteriorate 
 
 unhone rokatoke main likhaa he 'dilli kii hawa bighad gai isliye maharashtra kii hawa nahin bigadani chahie
 In Delhi, the police came out on the road and they broke the law
 yah araajaktaa kii chingaari he
 This is a lesson for those trying to create political chaos in Maharashtra
 maharashtra kaa nirnay maharashtra main hi hone kii disha main ham sabhi nikal pade hai

 khabar ke mutabik remo kii building ke gym trainer unke paas aae or bole ki unke paas ek pen drive main toilet ek prem katha kaa first half he
 Remo was surprised to hear this
 khabar ke mujtabik pehle to remo ko laga ki unke gym trailor majaak kar rahe hai
 But why didn't he check it once and as soon as Remo applied the pendrive, his senses flew away because he really had a copy of the film
 ye dekhakar remo ko laga ki unhen jald se jald is baat kii jaankaritoiletke filmmekars ko deni chahie
 Being a filmmaker, Remo felt that if the copy of the film went viral on the social platform, then the filmmakers could be at a huge disadvantage
 isliye remo ne is ghatana kii jaankaree ke liye akshay ko contact kiya
 This move of Remo immediately brought the filmmakers into action and they complained against it with the help of Crime Branch
 film kii produsar prerana aroda ne apane haalia bayaan main krime branch kaa shukriya adaa karte hue phans se kaha he ki ab kaai pareshaani vaali baat nahin he sab kuch control main he

 Assembly Speaker Ramesh Kumar held a press conference after hearing the political crisis in Karnataka and the resignation of mlas in the Supreme Court on Thursday
 unhone kaha ki meraa kaam kisi ko bachaana nahin he
 i have been in public life for 40 years
 maine izzat ke saath jindagi gujaarne kii koshish kii he
 The Speaker said that the legislators resigned on 6 July
 is din main 12
 By 42 was in his office
 iske baad main kaam karne chalaa gaya
 MLA 2
 30 baje aae
 They did not inform me before coming
 kuch log kah rahe hai ki vidhayak aa rahe the is vajah se main bhaag gaya
 He further said that Sunday is a holiday
 is din main daftar nahin khol saktaa
 On Monday, i had to do some personal work
 main uplabdh nahin tha
 i came on Tuesday
 istife kaa nirdhaarit praaroop hai
 The resignations of 8 mlas were not in that format
 spikar ne mukul rohtagi ke aarope kaa diya javabpurv atorni general mukul rohtagi ke aarope kaa jawaab dete hue spikar ramesh ne kaha ki main jaldbaaji main kaam nahin karata hum
 i only work under the Constitution
 main sirf samvidhan ke tahat hi kaam karne ke liye baadhya hum
 He said that i am bound to take voluntary resignation
 main svaichhik istife ke bare main nahin boluungaa
 Indeed, Mukul Rohatgi had said that the speaker was delaying accepting the resignation and acting in a partisan manner
 mujhe sirf samvidhan se premaspikar ramesh ne kaha ki yah sirf istife ko sweekaar karne or khaarij karne kaa maamla nahin he
 Between 1967 and 1971, several parties broke up and the state governments fell
 kya mujhako bijli kii raftaar se kaam karnaa chahie? or agar karnaa chahie, to phir kiske liye? aisa karne par niyamon or soobe kii janata kaa kya hoga
 i only love my constitution
 supreme court ke aadesh kaa zikr karte hue karnataka vidhansabha ke spikar ne kaha ki mere paas aaj kii kaarywahi kii video recording he, jo supreme court ko di jaaegi
 He said that the mlas did not talk to me and reached the Governor
 is par wo kya kar sakate hai? kya yah yah desh kii karypranali kaa durupyog nahin he
 The legislators then moved to the Supreme Court
 unhone kaha ki main is maamle par faisla lene main isliye deree kar rahaa hum, kyonki main is dharti se pyaar karata hum
 i do not work in a hurry
 main is desh ke samvidhan or rajya kii janata prati baadhya hum
 Speaker of Karnataka Legislative Assembly Ramesh questioned whether the mlas should go to the Supreme Court to meet me? The Supreme Court believes the same
 mujhase milane se vidhayakon ko kisne roka? wo mujhase milane kii bajaay mumbai main jaakar baith gaye or supreme court chale
 With this, i was accused of not accepting the resignation
 congress netaa sanjay nirupam kaa twitorahul kii raily main naa aane par twitatvive main likhaa, ‘nikamma kahaan tha?’maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main bhartiya janata party ko satta se baahar bhejne ke liye congress lakh koshishen kar rahi hai, lekin har baar uski urja apni party ke bheetar kii ladaai ko sulajhane main hi kharch ho ja rahi he
 Former Mumbai Congress President Sanjay Nirupam, who challenged the Delhi leadership by holding a press conference in the past, has once again attacked anyone in the party
 sanjay nirupam ne somvaar subah twitor par likhaa ki aakhir rahul gandhi kii raily main nikamma anupasthit kyon tha?congress netaa sanjay nirupam ne somvaar subah twit kiya
 He wrote that the things being done about my absence in Rahul Gandhi's Mumbai rally are completely wrong
 ek paariwarik kaarykram kii vajah se main puure din vyast rahaa tha or is bare main maine rahul gandhi ko pehle hi bataa diya tha
 He is my leader and he will always be the same for me
 Speculations & suspicions about my absence in rg’s Mumbai rallies are meaningless
 Due to an important family function i was very busy whole day, rather till late night
 Had informed him in advance
 He is my leader & he will always be the same for me
 But why was Nikamma absent ?— Sanjay Nirupam (@sanjaynirupam)october 14, 2019lekin iske baad jo sanjay nirupam ne likhaa usapar vivaad ho gaya
 He further wrote that '
 
 But why was the useless absent? ' Now Sanjay Nirupam is targeting who he is targeting through this, only he can tell better but the storm has come with his tweet on social media
 kai soshal media yugers unke is twit ko congress netaa milind devda par hamale ke taur par dekh rahe hai
 Significantly, the last few days between the two leaders are not going well and the differences between the two are constantly coming forward
 sanjay nirupam haal hi main hui mumbai main rahul gandhi kii raily main upasthit nahin the
 Will Sanjay Nirupam leave the Congress? Let us know that in the past, Sanjay Nirupam had questioned some leaders of the Congress party during a press conference
 darasal, sanjay nirupam tikat bantwaare ko lekar kaaphi naaraaz the or aarope laga rahe the ki unki marji ke kisi bhi ummidavaar ko tikat nahin saunpa gaya he
 Sanjay Nirupam had questioned the Congress leaders in a press conference and had even spoken about leaving the party
 saath hi unhone vidhansabha chunaav main prachaar naa karne kii baat kahi thi
 The film 'singham Returns' has been directed by Rohit Shetty and its lead actors are Ajay Devgn, Kareena Kapoor, Anupam Kher, Amol Gupte, Dayanand Shetty, Zakir Hussain, Sharat Saxena and Mahesh Manjrekar
 jin logon ne pehali 'singhm' dekhi he, unhen pataa hoga ki inspector bajirao singhm kaise bhrasht netaa or system ke khilaaf ladaai ladata he, aisi hi kuch ummiden thim 'singhm riterns' se
 Singham has now become DCP and is looking for those who use black money to buy votes, as well as to wash away the stains on police uniforms
 singhm yah kaise karegaa, jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Now i will tell you how i liked the film? The first thing was the script and screenplay in 'singham Returns', so i did not see it growing as cleanly or as smoothly as it did in the first 'singham'
 duusari baat film dekhte vakt aap purvanumaan kar sakenge ki film main kya ho saktaa he, aisa pehali 'singhm' main kam dekhne ko mila tha
 Thirdly, the condition of the police and the attitude of the public is shown in many places in the film, which is a good thing, but it was not coined in the script and screenplay
 rohit shetty kii film he to jaahir he ki ection seens hongen, par film main ye seens mujhe thode lambey lage
 Although the songs in the film are negligible but they also reduce the speed of the film and do not entertain anything special
 ab baari film kii khoobiyon kii
 Bajirao Singham once again won the game
 kai seens main mujhe laga ki yah kirdaar shaayad ajay ke alaava kisi or par itnaa sateek nahin baithegaa
 Ajay has filled both acting and heroism in his character
 karina ke jitne seens hai, vah screen ko urja se bhar detii hai or unki kamedi hansi bikherti he
 The action scenes are long, but Rohit has designed some stunts well and Ajay has done them well
 is baar film or film ke stant vaastaviktaa ke zyada kareeb hai
 Commercial films director Rohit has made an effort to rise above his image, though he could have made 'singham Returns' a film of his style

 The Chagla bench is hearing petitions filed on behalf of bank depositors
 in yachikaaon main arabiai kii nikasi seemaa ko chunauti di gai he
 Other restrictions, including cash withdrawal, were imposed by the RBI after the alleged financial irregularities surfaced at PMC Bank

 The bench said on Monday that it only wanted to know what RBI had done in this case
 adaalat ne kaha , "arabiai ko is bank ke sabhi kaamon kii jaankaree he
 RBI is a bank of banks and is the expert body for such issues
 ham arabiai ke kaam main baadha nahin daalana chaahate or na hi uske adhikaron ko kam karnaa chaahate hai
 "the court said that RBI would be the judge and not the court in such financial matters
 adaalat ne arabiai ko hafalanamaa jamaa karne kaa nirdesh diya he or maamle main agali sunwaayee ke liye 19 november kii taarikh tay kii he
 The court has denied any interim relief in the case
 ek yachikakarta ne nyaayalay se graahakon ko apane lokaron kaa upyog karne kii anumati dene kaa arabiai ko nirdesh dene maang kii thi
 The court declined to give any order, saying, "he cannot allow access to the locker
 ham yaa phir koi bhi arabiai ko karrwai karne se kaise roak sakate hai?" agar arabiai kahata he ki'' bank se dur rahen '', to aisa karen
 "the court said that depositors can sue the bank if they wish
 peeth ne kaha ki vakeelon ko jamakartaon ko juthi ummid nahin deni chahie ki adaalat unki madad karegi
 Justice Dharmadhikari said, “the courts are not magicians
 jamakartaon ko juthi ummid na den

 rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) kaa siyaasi bhavishya par in dinon sankat ke badal mandara rahe hai
 Maharashtra assembly elections are at the head and NCP leaders are joining hands with other parties one by one, leaving Sharad Pawar
 haalat ye ho gai he ki apane jin karibiyon ko lekar sharad pavaar ne 1999 main ensipi kii buniyaad rakhi thi unamem se zyaadaatar netaa aaj unka saath chhodkar ja chuke hai
 Trivedi of NCP has to say that in the struggle that took place in Congress about 20 years ago, Sharad Pawar formed Nationalist Congress Party along with Meghalaya Congress leader PA Sangma and Tariq Anwar of Bihar
 unamem se pavaar or sangama ke raste 2004 main hi alag ho gaye the or 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se ain vakt pehle tarik anwar bhi ensipi kaa saath chhodkar congress main shaamil ho gaye
 These three leaders played an important role in the formation of NCP
 maharashtra main bhi nahin bachaa koi sathisangma or tarik anwar ke ensipi kaa saath chhodane ke baad ab maharashtra main sharad pavaar ke jo saathi rahe wo bhi ab vidhansabha chunaav se ain vakt pehle unka saath lagaataar chhod rahe hai
 Among the founding members who left the NCP are Ganesh Naik, Madhukar Pichad and his MLA sons Vaibhav Pichad from Akola, Vijay Singh Mohite Patil and his sons Ranjit Singh Patil, Padma Singh Patil and Sachin Ahir
 ensipi ke ye vah naam hai jinhone sharad pavaar ke saath milakar party kii buniyaad rakhi or use maharashtra kii siyasat main majboot karne main ahm bhoomika adaa kii thi
 Leader leaders who have left the NCP are mostly joining the BJP
 iske baad duusare number kii pasand shivasena ho rahi he
 In such a situation, the challenge before the NCP is to preserve its existence
 NCP ko pavaar ne aise dilaai sattabata den ki congress main pavaar samarthak jo log the unheen ke dam par yah ensipi astitv main ai thi
 Hence they had local political institutions, means and activists
 isliye nai party ke rup main jo chunautiyaan ensipi ke saamne aati, uskaa use saamana nahin karnaa padaa
 Sharad Pawar through his political skills soon established the NCP as the ruling party
 is vajah se ensipi ne congress ke saath milakar 15 saalon tak satta main bane rahe
 Due to Sharad Pawar's leadership, the party workers were very active from the very beginning and the youth workers also remained with the NCP on a large scale
 pavaar ke hi kaaran ensipi ke raashtra kii raajnneeti main mahatvapurn jagah banaai
 That is why party supporters of the state are always enthusiastic and hope that their party will grow in stature
 siyaasi bhavishya bachaane ke liye chhod rahe ncpsamsaxanom kii kami kaa saamana ensipi ko 2014 main satta se alag hone ke baad karnaa padaa
 The result of this was that along with the leaders from other parties in the NCP, the party's founding leaders have also started searching for a safe place to save their political future
 iskaa nateeja he ki akelaa sharad pavaar parivaar hi ensipi main bachaa rah gaya he

 Head of Adolescent and Child Rights Network Assam (ACRNA) Drs
 chiranjeeb cacote poochhate hai, kya yah tasviir rashtri garv kaa pratik ban sakati he? darasal assam main darjanon skool aise hai jo barsaat ke mausam main baadh kii vajah se thap pad jate hai
 In such a situation, ACRNA together with about 21 organizations, this time in the Election Manifesto, found a unique way to get children's issues preferred
 ''chunavi ghoshnaa patr banaate samay partiyaan desh ke bhavishya ko bhul jaati hai, aaj ke bachche kal ke voter honge
 Adolescent and 21 partner organizations involved in the Child Rights Network Assam (ACRNA) have prepared a list of children's issues for the general elections starting next month
 bacchon se mulaakaat or phir unke muddon ko lekar brain storming kaa kaam karne vaale asiarene ke dal kaa netritv kar rahe dow
 Chiranjeeb Kakote said, this list has been prepared after a heavy effort of eight months
 dow
 Kakote says, while deciding these issues, neither the children were given any guidelines nor their issues were cut off
 sanstha kii taraf se bacchon se mulaakaat karne vaale dal ne unhen is prakriya kaa bas makasad bhar bataaya
 He says no political party prefers children's issues
 shaayad isaki vajah vartmaan main unka voter na hona he, lekin dhyaan rahe yahi bachche kal voter bhi banenge
 What are the issues every year there is flood and every year the schools are stalled
 assam main kai skool barsaat ke mausam main yadakada hi khulte hai
 This problem is there every year but the attention of any government does not go towards this
 aise main suchi main baadh prabandhan ke mudde ko pramukhataa se shaamil kiya gaya he
 Taking necessary steps for cleanliness, toilets in schools, health, malnutrition, mother and child mortality, care of mother and child health in Anganwadi, mid-day meal and education system that is stalled during the most urgent floods
 bal shram, child trephiking, bal vivaah ke mudde bhi suchi main shaamil kiye gaye
 The girls prominently demanded that sanitary pads should be systematically implemented in schools
 siyaasi dalon se mili baccha partirajya se kareeb 500 bacchon ne paanch siyaasi dalon ke pratinidhiyon se mulaakaat kar apana agenda patr saunpa
 a children's delegation has submitted its agenda to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Congress, Assam Gana Parishad (AGP), All India United Democratic France (AIUDF), Bodoland People's Front (BPF)

 or bhi rajyon main bachche uthaaenge mangadow
 Chiranjeeb Kakote said, "we have taken this initiative in one state right now
" hamaara network assam main hi he
 But if the organizations of other states also want to work on the agenda of children, we will definitely join them
 philhal ham partiyon ke ghoshnaa patr kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 With this unique initiative, Assam has become the first state in the country where children have submitted their agenda papers to political parties during the Lok Sabha elections
 agar yah pahal kaamyaab hoti he to duusare rajyon main bhi bacchon ke muddon ko siyaasi dal tavajjo dene ke liye aage aa sakate hai
 *** medanta ne america kii company ke saath milakar apane kism kii pehali stesan monitering and recovery technology pesh karne kii ghoshnaa kii he
 It is a pulse co-oximeter
 jo bistar ke saath rakhe monitor se milakar lagaataar bagaiyr cheerfaad ke nigaraanee muhaiyaa karaata he
 This gives the patient freedom to travel and move anywhere
 ek nishchit, dynamik, real time aadhaar par pahanane yogya yah upkaran marij kii sthirataa sunishchit karata he
 Also helps ensure faster recovery
 isamen marij ko nunatam samay bistar par rahanaa padataa he
 Apart from this, supplementary remote monitoring and medical notification system is also possible with this technology, so that data related to the patient can be monitored remotely
 iske alaava, marij jahaan kahin bhi ho isse alarm notification bheji ja sakati he
 This technology drastically reduces the number of fake alarms
 jisase doctors ke liye marijon or alarm par focus karnaa aasaan hota he, jo ki behad aavashyak he
 Announcing the adoption of Radius 7, Medanta president-manager director Doctornaresh Trehanne said, "medanta follows the best possible patient recovery ecosystem
" jo antarrashtriya maanakon ke anukool he
 The unique technology of its kind is an essential aspect of this value
 radius-7 ko apanaae jane se marijon ke ilaaj ke prati hamaari gahari patibaddhta kaa pataa chalata he
 John Kundan President World Wide Sales Massimo Corporation continued, “we are extremely proud to be associated with Medanta, one of the most acclaimed health care brands internationally
 masimo kii technology kaa antarrashtriya str par baari prabhaav rahaa he or ham bharat ke prayaason ke bhaag hona chaahate hai taaki health care ko sunishchit, behatar or aasaan banaaya ja saken
 "studies have shown that the mobility of the patient is the main contributor to speed up the recovery of the patient
 radius 7 halkaa he or marij kii bahon main atech kiya ja saktaa he
 In this way he can remain under surveillance without any bond
 vah chaahe to bistar par rahe yaa nahin
 This reduces the need for physical nursing support 
 kyonki marij ko bistar ke paas rakhen monitor se baar-baar conect yaa discnect karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin rahati
 This device continuously monitors important parameters without tearing
 iske baad data sarwar ko bheja jaataa he jo kendriya system se sanchaar karata he, jahaan doctor inhen dekh sakate hai
 In case of any disturbance in any of the parameters, the concerned nurse is informed on the pager

 In the exciting final match of the trophy, the Indian team was also able to win by going to the last ball against Bangladesh
 iske alaava bangladesh ne ek hai scoring match main mejabaan srilanka ko haraaya tha
 Bangladesh won the match and clinched their place in the finals of the trophy
 haalanki, is pradarshan ke alaava bangladeshi team ek or vajah se surkhiyon main rahi
 The incident took place in the dressing room outside the grounds
 bangladesh or srilanka ke bich group stage kaa aakhri match chal rahaa tha or jeet ke liye donon timen jor laga rahi thim
 Meanwhile, Mustafizur Rahman was run out
 do genden bounsar jane ke baad bangladeshi team ko laga tha ki duusari gend ko ampire no-ball qaraar denge
 However, this did not happen
 is dauraan bangladesh ke atirikt khilaadi srilankai khilaadi kushal mendis ke saath bahes main uljhe hue the to bangladeshi captain shaakib al hasan simarekha ke paas khadey the
 Angry, Shakib asked his players to come back
 bangladesh ne is match ko mahamudullah ke chhakke ke saath apane naam kiya tha
 After this match, pictures of a glass door in the dressing room of the Bangladeshi team were broken
 iske baad yah vivaad badhata hi chalaa gaya

 is maamle kii sisitivi footage se bhi saaf nahin ho paa rahaa he ki kisne is shishe ko todaa tha
 However, according to this newspaper report, the working staff has told the captain of Bangladesh Shabik Al Hasan's hand behind the incident
 bataaya gaya he ki hasan ne shishe ko jor se dhakka diya tha, jisase yah tut gaya
 Shakib was fined 25 per cent of his match fees and the ICC has added a demerit point to his account
 maidan par ulajhane vaale bangladeshi khilaadi nurul hasan ne apni galati ke liye maafee maangi he or un par bhi match fees kaa 25 fisadi jurmaana lagaaya gaya he
 There is also a demerit point in his account
 match referi broad ne is ghatana par kaha tha, 'main samajhataa hum ki yahmaidan par upje tanaav kaa nateejatha, lekin do khilaadiyon ke aise vyavhaar ko bardaasht nahin kiya ja saktaa
 If the fourth umpire had not stopped Shakib and the fielders, and the on-field umpires would not have intervened in the feud between Nurul and Thisara, it would have been a terrible blow

 The list of working committee of Uttar Pradesh BJP was released recently
 is suchi se varun gandhi kaa naam gaayab he
 As soon as 'aaj Tak' questioned this, there was a stir in the Uttar Pradesh BJP
 yahi nahin, party kaa kahana he ki vah aage ek nai sanshodhit suchi jari karegi
 However, it is still unclear whether Varun will be included in the new list
 bijepi kii is suchi main kai jilon se kai varisht netaaon ke naam bhi nadaarad hai
 The most popular names in it are Varun Gandhi and Smriti Irani
 bijepi sutron ke mutabik, smriti irani ke gujarat se rajyasabha sadsy hone ke kaaran unka naam suchi main shaamil nahin kiya gaya, lekin sawaal uthte hai ki aakhir varun kaa naam gaayab kyon he? 'aaj tak' koyupi bijepike varisht netaa kii ore se jo suchi mili he, usamen 250 se zyada bijepi netaaon ke naam shaamil hai
 The list includes Maneka Gandhi's name divided into three categories
 In this list, a list of special invitees, permanent invitees and members of the State Working Committee is given
 jabaki teenon main se kisi main bhi varun gandhi kaa naam nahin he
 However, the names of Varun Gandhi's mother and Union Minister Maneka Gandhi have been included in the permanent invitee list
 varun kaa naam na hone par pradesh adhyaksh keshav maury ke karyaalay se safai bhi di gai
 Maurya's personal assistant told that the list of the working committee has been released and some names have been omitted in it, which will be revised and the list will be released afresh
 haalanki, yah abhi bhi spasht nahin kiya gaya ki kya sanshodhit suchi main varun gandhi kaa naam shaamil kiya jayega? pradesh kaarysmiti main varun gandhi kaa naam kyon nahin he, or itnaa bada naam bhala bhul se kaise suchi main chhot saktaa he? is sawaal par bhi koi santoshjanak jawaab pradesh adhyaksh ke daftar se nahin mil sakaa
 Unconfirmed response from Varun's office
 On the other hand, Varun Gandhi's office said on the question of anonymity that he has not got any official list about it and according to the tradition of the party, all the elected mps and members of the National Working Committee are automatically Members are considered
 haalanki, varun gandhi ke nijee sahaayak is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin de sake ki jab purv piem atal bihari vaajapeyi, pradhanmantri narendra modi se lekar rajnath singh or menka gandhi tak sabhi varisht netaaon or upi ke pramukh saansadon ke naam suchi main shaamil kiye gaye hai to phir varun kaa naam kyon nahin?kiya jayega bhul sudhaarmaamle main upi bijepi ke pradesh sanghathan mantri sunil bansal ne bhi tasviir saaf kii
 He said that all the leaders involved in the National Working Committee from UP are also considered to be automatically involved in the State Working Committee
 rashtriya kaarysmiti main upi ke sabhi varisht netaaon ke naam pradesh kaarysmiti main bhi shaamil kiye gaye hai
 Some names were omitted in the new list of the state due to a mistake, it will be rectified by issuing a revised list about it before the meeting of the State Working Committee
