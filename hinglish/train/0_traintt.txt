 manthan ajtak 2017 ke chhathwein satr 'notebandi- kya khoyaa kya paaya?' main state bank of india kii purv cheirperson arundhati bhattacharya ne shirkat kii
 The session was conducted by Rajdeep Sardesai
 is satr kii shuruyaat karte hue rajdeep ne arundhati se poocha ki kya notebandi kaa faisla lene se pehle sarkaar ne aapse sampark kiya tha? arundhati ne kaha ki unhen bhi pradhanmantri ke elaan ke baad hi pataa chalaa ki notebandi kaa faisla hua he
 On the question of whether the decision was right or wrong, Arundhati said that more time is needed to evaluate any major decision
 arundhati ne ginaae notebandi ke 3 phydarundhati ne kaha ki notebandi ke do-teen nattejey saamne hai, pehla, desh main tex peyar kaa registration bad chukaa he
 Second, the currency circulation in the country was only 16 percent before 2016 but after demonetisation it has increased to 28 percent
 yah arthvyavastha ke liye ek bahut badi baat he
 Third, the pace of digitization in the country has accelerated
 yadi notebandi ke baad 10 rupee card ke madhyam se kharch ho rahe the to ab 300 rupee kharch ho rahe hai
 This is also a big thing for the country's economy
 tex choron ne tex dene kii disha main uthaaya pehla kadampradhanmantri ne desh main notebandi kaa elaan karte vakt kaha ki isse desh main aatankwaad par lagaam lagegi or kaledhan ko puri tarah se khatm kar di jaaegi
 Arundhati said that with the increase in the number of tax payers after demonetisation, one thing is clear that those who were not paying tax before November 2016 took the first step towards paying tax
 haalanki, arundhati ne kaha ki is kadam se kaledhan par puri tarah se lagaam nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 Now it is necessary that the deposit and withdrawal data received by the government in the process of demonetisation should be examined
 ise bhi padhein: 2019 ke liye modi kaa plan, daaud, dange yaa kargil jaisaa yuh raaj thakrekaledhan ko safed karne ke liye hui notebandi?arundhati ne kaha ki notebandi par kisi tarah kii raajnneetik pratikriya vah nahin de sakati hai
 However, he claimed that the banks at which the demonetisation process was carried out in the country did a huge job
 is tarah se desh kii karency ko kuch dinon main badal paanaa aasaan kaam nahin tha
 The common man believes that demonetisation is a good decision? Arundhati claims that those who pay tax in the country found demonetisation to be a good decision
 unka maananaa he ki aakhir kyon desh main koi tex chori kare
 Arundhati said that news was coming from village to village through our branches during the whole process
 in khabaron ke mutabik aam aadmi kaa yahi maananaa rahaa ki desh main samanaantar arthvyavastha ko roak lagaana jaruri tha
 However, there can be different ways of stopping this
 puri taiyaari ke saath honi thi notebandiarundhati ne kaha ki yadi notebandi kaa faisla sunaane se pehle isaki behatar taiyaari kii gai hoti to bainkon ke liye yah kaam aasaan hota
 According to Arundhati, she had to face many problems including security and technology in communicating such a large number of cash across the country
 kyon biimaar ho gaye desh ke sabhi bank?rajdeep ne poocha ki kya bainkon main capital infusion kaa kendra sarkaar kaa faisla thik he
 At the same time, how the condition of banks got so bad that today the government is paying tax payer money to save it
 isapar arundhati ne kaha ki desh main kaarobaar ko badhaava dene ke liye karj dena jaruri he
 At the same time, your risk is involved in giving and taking loan
 mahaj risk ke chalate bank kisi ko kaarobaar badhaane ke liye karj dene se inkaar nahin kar sakati
 At the same time, where banks feel that a businessman wants to take a loan just for not paying the loan, then he is not given a loan
 companiyaan karj na chukaa paane kii sthiti main kaarobaari kaarnon se hi pahunchati he or bainkon ko iskaa boj uthaanaa padataa he

 Without water, the boat of life remains stuck in the midstream
 aisa hi kuch in dinon bihar main bhi ho rahaa he
 Sudhir Yadav of Visiyyat in Nawada district used to sell 20 liters of milk everyday, giving him Rs 600
 kii aamadani ho jaati thi or unke 17 sadasyeey parivaar kaa chulhaa jalataa tha
 In the scorching heat, the heat of the stove of Sudhir's house has also dimmed
 isaki vajah gaanv main peyajal sankat ke kaaran aamadani kaa jariya rahi chaaron bhainson ko bechnaa he
 To deal with this problem, Sudhir paid Rs 20,000
 kharch kar 175 foot kii boring bhi karwaai, lekin safalataa haath nahin lag saki
 As a result, now three of Sudhir's brothers have to go to work abroad
 yahi nahin, unhen apni pyaas bujhane ke liye kareeb ek kimi kii duuri par sthit kuen se pani laana padataa he, jahaan lambii qatari lagi rahati he
 "the price of water in the village is more than milk," says Sudhir
 gaanv ke log aapas main doodh to le-de sakate hai, lekin pani nahin
 "sudhir is not the only person who is trapped in such a situation
" bihar ke navada jile ke mescor block ke viciit ke baleshwar mahato ko bhi pani ke abhaav main har roj 1,200 ru

 But due to lack of water, this business has come to a standstill

 Actually, this situation is created by the rapid decline in ground water
 gaanv ke adhikansh jal strot, kuen or handpump suukh chuke hai
 Visiyait is not the village of Akavla, where there is a ruckus for water
 mescor block main do darjan se zyada aise gaanv hai, jahaan pani kii gambhir samasya he
 The Meskaur block headquarters is also not untouched by the water problem
 mescor police ko ek kimi dur se pani laana padataa he
 Although there are five hand pumps in the police station, but all have become useless due to the fall in ground water level
 police adhikari jaganarayan ram ke mutabik, ''haal bura he
 Lack of water has made it difficult
 ''kuakol ke gramin pashuon ko bechate nahin hai
 Often the villagers struggling with such problems migrate to floods, Barhia, Bakhtiyarpur, Mokama, and lowland areas of Nepal as soon as the summer starts and return after the rains
 kuakol ke vishwaas vishwakarma bataate hai ki is ilaake se har saal kareeb 20,000 pashuon kaa palaayan hota he, jamui jile ke khera ko jod den to yah sankhya 30,000 pahunch jaaegi
 The problem does not end here
 ek gaanv he dudhpaniya
 The villagers believe that the color of the water here was like milk, due to which the name of the village is Dudhpania
 lekin ab kuen kaa ganda pani bhi mushkil se mil rahaa he
 In Adampur, Nardiganj, people are forced to drink river water even during the rainy days
 haalanki 1966-67 main deshvyapee akaal ke samay lokanayak jaiprakash narayan ne 4,000 kuon kii khudaai karai thi, ab unka astitv bhi nahin bachaa he
 The problem of Nawada is the hallmark of drinking water crisis in Bihar, where the ground water level is 10 in May

 baharhaal, rashtriya ausat kaa 17 fisadi pani bihar main he
 According to the national standard, drinking water points are to be set up at 250 people for availability of at least 40 liters of water per person per day in rural areas
 lekin isse bhi zyada pareshaani bhu-jal ke teji se neeche khisakane se paidaa ho rahi he
 It is a matter of concern that the sale and migration of cattle has started due to lack of water
 agar yah udaseenta kaayam rahi to vah din dur nahin jab pani ke liye bade str par insaan bhi palaayan karenge

 Article 35A which gives special rights to the residents of Kashmir, amid speculation about the removal and strong opposition to any such possible move by the state political parties, Sonia Singh's book 'defining India: Through Their Eyes' (defining India: Through In his Eyes), Arun Jaitley has clarified what the BJP government is thinking on this controversial article
 iske khilaaf maamla supreme court main lambit he
 Former Union Minister Arun Jaitley spoke to Sonia Singh before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 agar sarkaar 35e ko hataane par par aage badhati he to unki baat bhavishyavaanee kii tarah sach sabit ho jaaegi
 'article 35A (the constitutional provision of 1954 which empowers the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly to determine who will be permanent residents of the state who will have the rights to purchase property and to do a government job in the state, etc
) is a constitutional puzzle
 ise kisi sanshodhan dwaara samvidhan main nahin joda gaya tha jise donon sadanon main do tihaai samarthan praapt ho
 It was an executive entry by notification of the President
 ise pichley daravaaje se samvidhan main shamil kiya gaya
 This includes a fundamental violation of the right to equality, as it promotes discrimination between two categories of citizens on the basis of an attenuated norm
 yah sanvaidhanik rup se kamjor he
 'it is said by the man who has been the top lawyer of the country and still the government trusts on constitutional and legal issues
 isse yah bhi pataa chalata he ki centre is masale par kya soch rahaa he
 The petition against Article 35A is pending in the Supreme Court
 arun jetali kehete hai, 'anuchhed 35e ke saath hi vishesh darje ke sangyojan ne jammu-kashmir ke logon ke hiton ke khilaaf kaam kiya he
 This inhibited investment in the state
 koi bhi bada udyog, hotel shrinkhalaa, nijee shikshan santhaan aadi rajya main nahin aae
 People with outside qualifications were not available for scientific research, management of hospitals and medical institutes and technical colleges
 koi rajya main kyon aana chahega agar wo yahaan ghar nahin kharid saktaa, uske bachche sarkari collejon main daakhila nahin le sakate or wo sarkari naukari nahin kar sakate? rajya ke sanvaidhanik dhaanche ne yahaan ke logon ko chot pahunchaai, lekin isane kuch logon kii algaavvaadi maansikta ko santusht kiya
 'jaitley insists,' However, Pakistan tried to fight the traditional war but was defeated
 pichley teen dashakon main rajya main ashaanti failaane ke liye usne sangathit aatankwaad or seemapar se ghuspaith ko protsaahit kiya
 Democracy, secularism and public order collapsed

 In an atmosphere of fear, both administration and elections were affected
 puraa kashmiri pandit samudaay or zyaadaatar sikh rajya se visthapit ho gaye
 This was nothing short of an ethnic cleansing

 'today they feel that this is a defining moment for the Kashmir issue
 jetali kehete hai, 'desh aaj is baat par charchaa kar rahaa he ki 70 saal pehle nehru dwaara kii gai badi bhul ko kaise sudhara jaae
 Most Indians believe that Panditji's foresight and the formation of Kashmir proved disastrous
 saat dashakon kaa anubhav or jo keemat chukaani padi wo hamen ghur rahe hai
 Keeping in view the interests of the Kashmiri people, our approach should be guided by the welfare of the people of the state and the principles of security and sovereignty

 The yatra, which started from Gandhiji's Satyagraha Ashram in Kochrab, Ahmedabad, will end with a speech by Rahul Gandhi on 9 February at the Swaraj Ashram in Bardoli, South Gujarat, passing through 250 villages and 10 towns

 The idea behind the yatra is to meet villagers along the way to highlight the fact that development has not reached the common man, contrary to Modi's claims

 The Supreme Court verdict, which came on the petition of a Gujarat Congress leader Deepak Babaria, gave the party an opportunity to accuse the Modi government and its industrial policy and "vibrant Gujarat" investment conventions of corruption

 Despite this, the truth is that in Modi's home state, the Congress faces a tough challenge

 Bollywood actor Imran Khan is going to make a comeback on the big screen after almost two years, and his upcoming film is titled 'katti Batti', the most important thing of which is that his pairing with Kangana Ranaut for the first time in this film is
 imran khan ke liye 'katti batti' vaise bhi khaas he, kyonki vah is film ke jariye do saal baad parde par dikhaai denge

 "comments brake par jane se pehle imran khan kii film 'vans apon e time in mumbai dobaaraa', 'gori tere pyaar main' or 'mataru kii bijli kaa mondola' jaisi filmein flop ho chuki thim
 It is a pleasure for Imran at the time of his comeback that his heroine in 'katti Batti' is Kangana Ranaut, whose 'tanu Weds Manu Returns' has also become a big hit after 'queen' and Kangana is on the horse of success these days Are on board
 kangana ne bataaya ki 'katti batti' main donon kaa kirdaar mahatvapurn he or imran khan kii film main bhoomika zyaada he
 'katti Batti' is a romantic comedy film, made for today's youth
 dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki safalataa kii sadak par daud rahi kangana ranavat ke saath chalane ke baad imran khan ke haath kya lagata he, kyonki aise halaat main kamyaabi kaa sehara usee ke sir bandhata he, jo us vakt safal he

 vaapasi ke samay imran ke liye khushi kii baat yah he ki 'katti batti' main unki heroin kangana ranavat hai, jinaki film 'queen' ke baad 'tanu vaids manu riterns' bhi badi hit ho chuki he or kangana in dinon kamyaabi ke ghode par savaar hai

 Kidney problems are increasing in the country due to reasons such as luxurious lifestyle, lack of manual labor, unsymmetrical eating, stress
 madhumeh or ucch raktchaap gurde kii sthaayee samasya ke mukhya kaaran hai lekin jaankaree ke abhaav ke kaaran jab tak is beemaari kaa pataa chalata he tab tak beemaari asaadhya rup le chuki hoti he
 Dr AK Bhalla, Senior Consultant, Department of Nephrology, Sir Gangaram Hospital, says, "it is most important to spread awareness about this disease as the disease is a 'silent killer' and in most cases it is detected when the kidney is 80% defective

 ‘ khaas baat ye he ki gurde kii bimariyon kii chapet main ab yuva bhi aa rahe hai

 ambar khara ne kaha ‘yuvaaon par kaam kaa tanaav lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he, aise main unamem raktchaap jaisi pareshaani bad rahi he
 Kidney disease is also directly related to this, in such a situation, now young and thus home working members are also constantly falling prey to this disease
 ’dow
 Khara said 'often people go to general practitioners when they face any problem
 jarurat is baat kii he ki agar in chikitsakon ko gurde kii beemaari ke koi sanket milen to ye marij ko visheshgy ke paas jane kii salaah den
 The government should make such rules for general practitioners that if they do not advise the patient to go to the specialist concerned, then there should be a provision for punishment
 ’balaji medical and ajukeshan trust ke da rajan ravichandran kehete hai ‘pehle logon ko nishchit maatra main namak kaa seven karne par koi nuksaan nahin hota tha kyonki tab jeevanstyli aisi thi jisamen shaareerik shram adhik karnaa padataa tha, lekin ab zyaadaatar log asi main baith kar apana adhik se adhik kaam computer ke jariye nipataate hai
 Avoidance of manual labor
 aise main namak kaa kam se kam seven karnaa chahie
 But most people are not even aware of this
 ’da bhalla bataate hai ‘samay rahete samasya kaa pataa chalane par yah koshish kii jaati he ki gurde ko lambey samay tak kaise sakriy rakhaa jaae
 It is advisable to exercise restraint in food and to balance the lifestyle
 ‘da ravichandran kehete hai ‘gurde kii samasya ke bare main jaankaree na hone se log ise gambhirtha se bhi nahin lete
 There are about nine lakh people in the country who need dialysis

 4000 thousand rupees is spent in just one dialysis, whereas in case of renal failure, dialysis becomes mandatory
 chote shaharon main yah suvidha uplabdh bhi nahin he

 It is difficult to find out who was using that mail id

 On this, Hrithik lodged a complaint in the cybercrime cell that someone was sending mails to Kangana with my name

 Case started from where: Kangana used the word 'silly X' while giving Pinkvilla an interview

 When Kangana was asked about this, she said, 'I am hearing many strange rumors

 'iske thik baad rithik ne twit karke kaha tha ki media jin mahilaon ke saath mere sambandh kaa zikr kar rahaa he, usase zyada sambhaavna he ki meraa sambandh kisi pope ke saath ho

 The Law Commission is exploring possibilities of how to conduct Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections simultaneously in the country
 haalanki, congress or bijepi jaise bade dalon ne bhi vidhi ayog ko apni raay nahin bheji he
 While some opposition parties say that this method is not right

 You will remember Jharkhand Education Minister Neera Yadav

 The Modi government has passed the first floor on the bill to declare triple talaq and punish the sentence
 teen talaak virdohi kanoon ‘da muslim vimen protection of ritis in marij act' guuruuvaar ko loksabhaa main paas ho gaya
 Without any amendment, it is not easy for the Modi government to pass it in Rajya Sabha like Lok Sabha
 bijepi ke paas rajyasabha main bahumat nahin he, aise main sahyogi dalon ke saath-saath vipakshi dalon kaa samarthan bhi hasil karnaa hoga
 Only then will this bill be implemented legally
 modi sarkaar ke mantri or bijepi netaa teen talaak bill par sahmati banane ke liye vipakshi partiyon se baatcheet main jute hue hai
 The Modi government wants to pass this bill from the Rajya Sabha in the winter session itself, which is nothing less than crooked
 rajyasabha main bijepi ke paas itani takat nahin ki wo apane boote par teen talaak virdohi kanoon ko paarit kara sake
 In such a situation, BJP will have to depend on its allies as well as opposition parties on this bill
 rajd se lekar bijedy tak jahaan is vidheyak ke virodh main hai to vahiin congress sahit shivasena kuch sanshodhan chaahati hai
 Parties like Congress, SP CPI (M) have questioned the haste of the Lok Sabha Bill and sent it to the Parliamentary Committee

 The opposition has a substantial number of forces and majority in the Rajya Sabha
 isiilie mana ja rahaa he ki vipaksh ek saath sanshodhan ke liye dabaav banane or use sansadeey samiti ke paas bhejne ke liye agrah kar sarkaar ke liye mushkilen khadi kar saktaa he
 Who has the strength in the Rajya Sabha? There are 28 political parties in the 245-member Rajya Sabha, except the independents and nominated members, whose members are there
 maujuuda samay main rajyasabha main bijepi ke paas 57 sadsy, congress ke paas 57, tiemasi ke 12, bijedy ke 8, bispi ke 5, sapa ke 18, AIADMK ke 13, sipiem ke 7, sipiai ke 1, diemke ke 4, ensipi ke 5, pidipi ke 2, inolo ke 1, shivasena ke 3, telugudesham party ke 6, tiares ke 3 wiesar ke 1, akali dal ke 3, argedy ke 3, arpiai ke 1, janata dal(es) ke 1, muslim lig ke 1, kerala congress ke 1, naga pipuls front ke 1, bipief ke 1 or esadf ke 1 sadsy hai
 In addition, there are 8 nominated and 6 independent members

 These include 57 BJP members
 modi sarkaar ko apane sabhi sahyogi dalon kaa saath mil jaataa he, to bhi bill ko paarit karaane ke liye kam se kam 35 or saansadon ke samarthan kii jarurat hogi
 However, Shiv Sena objected to not taking the opinion of everyone on this bill

 2

 adwaniji ko kisi laayak nahin samajhaadwani ji ke saath bhaajapa ne jo anyaay kiya he usapar shatrughna ne kaha ki log pehle se kah rahe the, lekin yah jis tarah se hua he, vah galat he
 Advani ji is like a guru for the BJP leadership
 isse pehle bhi jaswant singh, yashavanth sinha or arun shouri jaise logon ke saath bhi aisa hi kiya gaya
 There should not have been such oppression and injustice
 aap unase kuch bhi galat likhva sakate hai ki marji se aisa hua he, lekin aisa kuch nahin he
 The people of the country are angry
 bhaajapa ne adwani ji ko kisi bhi pad ke laayak nahin samajha
 BJP will have to bear the brunt of this
 He is a father figure & no one can approve of such a treatment to a father figure
 What you & your people have done with me, is still tolerable
 I'm able & capable of answering your people back in the same coin
 Remember Newton's third law

 pratikriya main pashchim bengal main hinsa bhadak uthi
 It was certain that the matter would deteriorate badly and this happened
 isaki chingaari udi thi police hiraasat main hui vampanthi chaatr kaaryakarta kii dukhad maut se
 But this chaos spread in West Bengal raised serious concern when the Baker Laboratory of the Presidency University was vandalized
 tamaam tarah se garib pashchim bengal main ise kam-se-kam rajya kii shaan mana jaataa rahaa he
 After this unfortunate incident, the debate and protest marches on TV used "unprecedented like never before" ie unprecedented, which led to the feeling that Kolkata has never seen such a boil before
 vidambnaa he ki sheersh par rahe shiksha ke is centre ke liye yah sharmnaak ghatana kuch khaas nahin thi
 From the mid-1960s to the 1975 Emergency that took the shape of a bloody silence, both College Street and the Presidency College were witness to the endless battle between various leftist parties and the Congress
 bam, pipe gan or baahubal se ladi gai aisi raajnneeti, jise bevajaah badha-chadhaakar pesh kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Baker Lab was demolished in 1966 and 1970 as well
 1967 main vam dalon ke varchasv vaali sanyukt morcha sarkaar ke shiksha mantri ne college street main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue sambhavit vargeey ladaai ke liye hathiyaar muhaiyaa karaane kaa vaada kiya tha
 In the coffee house located on the other side of the street from the Presidency, there would have been a debate among the radical students of the college on whether a knife or a gun was used to eliminate the class enemy
 Does not fall into the category at all
 yah koi prashasnic laaparvaahee bhi nahin thi, jiske liye rajyapal em
 K
 narayanan ne chaatro se maafee maangi
 However, this incident is certainly a gesture
 pashchim bengal kii samasya yah nahin he ki ek chamatkaari netaa sadak kii raajnneeti se uthakar sarkaar main ja pahunchi he
 The problem is much deeper
 rajnatik hinsa ne sabase pehle 20veen sadi kii shuruyaat main bengaaliyon ke khun main pravesh kiya
 However, the incident was not limited to only "agitating" groups who attempted to assassinate British officers or armed rebellion
 ugantar or anushilan samiti jaise samoohon ne congress kii mukhyadhara main pravesh kiya or gandhivadi aadarshon ke mukaable duusari parampara khadi kii
 Later, a large section joined the communist movement
 1947 tak bengal main hinsa kaa matlab tha sampradayik dange
 After independence, all the attention turned into political violence
 1948 main nae aaazaad rajya ke prati apana virodh darj karaane ke liye ativaadee vampanthi kaaryakartaaon ne kaarkaane ke fire byler main ek europea suparvizer ko phenk diya tha
 In the early 1950s, many trams were burnt by the Left in Kolkata to protest the increase in the fare of a tram in Kolkata
 1970 ke dashak main naksali chaatr aksar mahatma gandhi or duusare prakhyat bharatiyon kii murtiyon ko tod daalate, vyast sadakon par kaam kar rahe yatayaat pulicekarmiyon kaa galaa retkar maar daalate, yahaan tak ki jadavapur university ke kulapati ko bhi us vakt maut ke ghat utaar diya, jab ve shaam ko apane parisar main tahal rahe the
 The CPI (M) has created a different history of barbaric violence
 bardwan main congress samarthak sen bhaaiyon ko unki maa ke saamne berahami se maar daalaa gaya tha
 Violence is not always the act of goons and Mwalis
 kai barbar hatyaon ke peeche abhijaat collejon ke chaatr bhi shaamil rahe, jinhone kranti main apane yogadan ke naam par inhen anjaam diya
 Many of these educated criminals were given a one-way ticket to Europe and America with the connivance of the police
 1972 ke baad ‘‘shwet aatank’’ kii lahar ne naksaliyon or makapa par nakel kasi or unhen kaabo kar liya
 But by then the culture of violence on the land of West Bengal had deep roots
 32 varshon ke vam morcha shashan ne upree taur par shanti behaal kar rakhi thi
 But the reality was that the same party dominated every aspect of life
 vam ke khilaaf mamata kii lambii or kathor ladaai main dikhaai gai jujharu hataasha us asaamaanya rajnatik samskruti kaa aprihaary nateeja thi, jo ashishnutaa or apradhi maansikta par kendrit thi
 Just remember the story of 1991, when left-wing activists attacked them in public places with iron rods and turned them down
 trinmul main vam morche kii tarah koi sadhi hui kaman vyavastha nahin he
 It is imprisoned in the shackles of many power centers, where local "dada" continue to appear for their different preferences
 lekin akeli jaan ko gherkar kai logon kaa tut padana ek aisi parampara ko darshata he jo 1960 ke dashak se jas kii tas bani he
 West Bengal needs even more administrative agility
 samay kii maang he ki rajya or yahaan ke samaaj main ghule jahrile tatwon ko nikaal phenkane kii prakriya shuru ho or iskaa jitna raajnneetikaran ho chukaa he, use kam kiya ja sake
 Unless Bengal questions the fundamental points of its recent political legacy, it will remain bended to its knees in these circumstances

 fasebuk or twitor par unki ore se daawey kiye ja rahe hai ki paris kii ore se nai dilli ko rafel deal ke saath tohfe main muft bhi bahut kuch diya ja rahaa he
 a post on the Facebook page named 'atal Modi' claimed that France has decided to give 32 Jaguars and 2 Mirage-2000 fighter jets to India as a gesture of goodwill
 is pej par 17 lakh likes hai
 This page is not the official page of Modiji, this page is being run by a supporter of Modiji
 By liking this page, you too became a member of this page
 The India Today Fact Check team decided to investigate such claims
 modi sarkaar france kii company daso (dassault) ke saath 36 rafel ladaaku vimaanon kii kharid ke liye 2016 main hui deal ko lekar vipaksh ke aaropon ke ghere main he
 In such a situation, are the claims of jaguar-mirage 2000 being given as a gift from France on social media platforms to justify the decision of the Modi government regarding the Rafale deal? The Fact Check team found that the Rafale deal Also, the claim of giving free jaguars is nothing but propaganda
 bhartiya vayusena se jude sutron ke mutabik puraane pad chuke jaguaaron ke maujuuda bede kii dekhbhaal karnaa hi baari ho rahaa he
 a senior Indian Air Force officer wondered, "why would the Air Force be willing to take more such aircraft?" Then where did the rumor of free jaguars being given along with the Rafale deal first fly ? The Fact Check team tracked a French weekly magazine which quoted a claim from France government sources a year earlier that France intended to deliver 31 Jaguar fighter jets to India
 ye sahi he ki bharat apane ladaaku vimaanon ke daston ko badalanaa chahta he
 The Indian Air Force requires 42 squads, but currently it has 31 squadrons of fighter aircraft
 ucch padasth sutron ke mutabik france kaa pehla rafel multirol ladaaku vimaan 2019 tak hi bharat aa paaegaa, aise main bhartiya vayusena ko spair parts kii tatkaal aavashyaktaa he
 Indian Air Force sources told the Fact Check team that about 61 Jaguar aircraft are to be upgraded by the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for the Navy and Air Force
 isi tarah miraj-2000 ladaaku vimaanon ke teen daston ke liye bhi asal spair parts uplabdh nahin hai
 France retired its Jaguar aircraft in 2005 itself
 inhen daso rafel multirolladaku vimanonse badla gaya tha
 Countries like Britain, Ecuador, Nigeria and Oman have also removed Jaguar aircraft
 raksha mantralay ke sutron ne india today ko bataaya ki france ne apane ritair ho chuke jaguaar ladaaku vimaanon se spair parts dene par sahmati jataai he
 According to an official source, these spare parts will be brought to India and for this, we will have to pay for the flight only
 fact chekatim kii jaanch se ye saaf he ki bharat ko france se jaguaar ladaaku vimaan nahin mil rahe
 What we are getting are just Jaguar spare parts which will be able to keep our existing Jaguar aircraft capable of flying
 saath hi in spair parts kaa rafel deal se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 From the ramparts of the Red Fort, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his speech on Monday also mentioned Balochistan of Pakistan
 lekin congress netaa or purv videsh mantri salmaan khurshid ne baluchistan par bolne vaale piem modi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Aaj Tak spoke exclusively to Khurshid on this issue
 isi baatcheet ke khaas ansh
 
 
 Rajiv Shuklane, a Congress party leader and a minister in the UPA government, has said in the talks till date that the statement the Prime Minister has made on Balochistan is not new
 yah to congress ke narsimha raav sarkaar kii line thi jise unhone doharaaya he
 What would you say on this? Khurshid: i was the Minister of State for External Affairs at that time
 kabhi bhi yah line nahin rahi
 If someone is saying this about Balochistan, then he is making a wrong statement and is lying, i do not agree with this
 baluchistan par pradhanmantri ne jo kaha, us par purv videsh mantri ke naate aap kaa kya kahana he?khurshid:pradhanmantrine puri tarah galat bayaanbaji kii he
 Speaking in the case of any country has never been India's foreign policy
 pradhanmantri ne jo kaha he, vah aane vaale vakt main bharat ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban saktaa he
 What kind of foreign policy is it that sometimes you call the Prime Minister of Pakistan for the swearing-in ceremony, sometimes you suddenly come to meet Nawaz Sharif and sometimes you fight
 baluchistan par bharat kaa hameshaa se hi yah stand rahaa he ki ham kam-se-kam laal kile kii pracheer se kisi duusare desh ke maamalon main dakhsandaji nahin karte
 In such a situation, what the Prime Minister did will create problems in the coming times
 lekin aap ne bangladesh ko alag karke kya kiya tha?khurshid:vah ek alahada mudda tha
 Millions of refugees came to India
 bangladesh mukti vahini kaa saath dena us vakt kaa takaza tha
 He should not be associated with this
 agar kahin maanavadhikaar kaa ulanghan ho rahaa he to ham us maamle par baat karte hai lekin laal kile kii pracheer se pradhanmantri ne jo kaha vah nuksaandeh he
 India may have to bear the brunt of this in the coming times
 videsh niti ko kaise dekhte hai aap?khurshid:modi sarkaar kii yah videsh niti flop videsh niti he jo main aapako bataa chukaa hum
 But it is not a game of gulli poles that you shot with a stick, someone got hit and you said sorry and then put the matter forward
 ab aage aap videsh niti ke maamle main kya dekhte hai?khurshid:mujhe lagata he pradhanmantri ko is maamle par nae sire se vichaar karnaa chahie
 Now he will apologize or change the policy
 kaise karenge yah unako dekhnaa he lekin damege control to karnaa hi hoga varanaa bharat kaa cese duniyabar main kamjor ho jayega
 Salim does not even remember the manner in which he had come from his village Kosi Kalan to Delhi many years ago

 Former Commonwealth Games Organizing Committee officials Lalit Bhanot and VK Verma were sent on five-day CBI remand on Thursday in connection with alleged irregularities of Rs 107 crore in a deal with a Swiss company
 vishesh nyaayadhish talavant singh ne kaha, ‘donon aropiyon ko paanch din kii sibiai hiraasat main bheja jaataa he
 The CBI told the court that both the accused misused their official position and awarded a contract of about Rs 107 crore to Swiss-based company Swiss Timing Ltd at an exorbitant rate, which led to a huge loss to the government
 sibiai ne aayojan samiti ke purv mahasachiv bhanot or purv mahanideshak verma ko buudhvaar ko giraftaar kiya tha
 Both of them are considered very close to Suresh Kalmadi, the former head of the organizing committee

 The CBI further said that the attitude of the accused has been 'disturbing and uncooperative' and they are not disclosing the true facts and circumstances of the criminal conspiracy
 sibiai ke aavedan kaa virodh karte hue bhanot ke vakil ramesh gupta ne kaha ki swiss company ko theka dene main unke muvakkil ne koi bhoomika nahin nibhaai
 He questioned the filing of an FIR on the basis of which Bhanot and Verma were arrested

 Senior advocate Aman Lekhi, appearing for Verma, said that the FIR has been "completely fabricated"

 The agency had registered a case against Bhanot and Verma along with Swiss Timing Limited and other unknown persons under various sections of Indian Penal Code Section 120B (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating) and Prevention of Corruption Act
 sibiai ne apni praathmiki main aarope lagaaya he ki is ghoshnaa ke saath aashay patr (ioai) prakashit karaayaa gaya ki keval swiss company hi maapdandon par khari utari

 ravivaar ko lakhanu ke ramabai ambedkar maidan par ikattha hue logon ko bijepi ke manch par atal bihari vaajapeyi kii vishaal chhavi najar ai
 At the time Narendra Modi was addressing the rally, a huge photo of Atal Bihari Vajpayee was seen in the background
 narendra modi ne apane bhaashan main atal bihari vaajapeyi ko baar-baar yaad kiya or kaha ki unhone vaajapeyi se kaaphi kuch siikhaa he
 In Vajpayee's style, Modi also introduced lions in his speech and concluded by reciting a poem
 bijepi ne kaaphi soch-samajhakar lakhanu kii modi kii raily main sirf atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa photo hi manch par lagane kaa faisla kiya
 Vajpayee won the Lucknow Lok Sabha seat continuously from 1991 to 2004
 isi seat kaa pratinidhitiv karte hue wo teen baar pradhanmantri bane
 Under him, the BJP won the most seats in the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh
 vaajapeyi kaa cheharaa aage rakh kar bijepi ne rajya main savarnon khaastaur se brahmanon kaa bharpoor samarthan hasil kiya
 In the form of Kalyan Singh, the party also had a very strong leader representing the backward castes
 vidhansabha chunaav se pehle 25 april 2007 ko lakhanu main unhone apni aakhri raily ko sambodhit kiya
 In which he again reiterated that the road to Delhi passes through Lucknow
 modi or bijepi ko vaajapeyi kii ye sikh yaad he
 That is why the party has put its full emphasis on Uttar Pradesh
 haalanki abhi ummidavaaron ke naamon kaa elaan nahin kiya gaya he
 But it is certain that BJP will take special care of social engineering in ticket distribution
 party ke saamne chunauti he savarnon or pichhadi jatiyon kaa samarthan jutanaa
 a major goal has also been set to attract Brahmins again in the state
 gauratlab he ki bahujan samaaj party loksabhaa chunaav ke liye abhi tak 22 brahman ummidavaaron ke naam ghoshit kar chuki hai
 Its strategy is once again for Dalit, Muslim and Brahmin alliances
 yahi ranneeti 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main apana kar bispi ne aitihaasik jeet hasil kii thi
 That is why BJP has remembered Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 lakhanu kii raily modi kii rajya main aathvin raily thi
 Before this, no photo of Vajpayee alone was put on the stage of any rally nor was he remembered so strongly
 vaajapeyi ke sakriy raajnneeti se hatane ke baad se bijepi ko khaastaur se uttar pradesh main unki kami behad mahasoos hoti he
 In the last several elections, BJP has been repeatedly trying to bring the upper castes with them, but it has not been successful in this
 rajya main party kaa mat pratishat lagaataar kam hota ja rahaa he
 Its support among the backward castes went down
 bijepi is patan ko sanbhaalane ke liye is baar gambhir prayaas kar rahi he
 The party has put forward Narendra Modi
 use ummid he ki modi kii hindutv or vikaas kii chhavi or pichde varg se aane kaa phayda uttar pradesh main milegaa
 The party's effort is that Modi should also contest elections from Uttar Pradesh so that his popularity can benefit
 sambhaavna he ki modi banaras se chunaav lard sakate hai
 Kalyan Singh is back in BJP
 party ek yaa usase adhik pichhadi jatiyon kii raajnneeti karne vaali kuch choti-choti partiyon se bhi talmail karne kii koshish kar rahi he taaki gaiyr yadav pichhadi jatiyaan uske saath aa saken
 However, the challenge for the BJP is extremely tough
 atal bihari vaajapeyi jaise udaaravaadi netaa jo musalamaanon ko bhi saath lene kii koshish karte rahe or lakhanu jaisi seat se lagaataar jeetne ke peeche ye bhi ek badi vajah rahi
 Today he is replaced by a leader like Modi whose image is of a staunch leader
 sampradayik rup se samvedansheel rajya uttar pradesh main modi kii isi chhavi ko oochaal kar samaajawaadee party, bahujan samaaj party or congress teenon hi musalamaanon ko apane saath lene kii koshish kar rahi hai
 All parties are trying to polarize the state communally
 samaajawaadee party sarkaar ke do saal ke kaarykaal main hue sau se bhi zyada dangon ke kaaran maahaul main behad talkhi bhi he
 But is it enough for the BJP to just put a photo of Vajpayee or take his name? Or to apply their given political lessons on the ground? bijepi ko rajya main 1996 or 1998 jaisi kamyaabi dohraane ke liye apane mat pratishat ko kam se kam dhai guna karnaa hoga
 For this, empty slogans cannot work, nor with any one prescription
 yahi narendra modi kii sabase badi chunauti he

 Documents related to the new policy have been received by NDTV, and it has been found that its main aspect is that instead of banning the entire defense conglomerate under the policy being implemented by the previous UPA government, the new policy prohibits defense products and the company Will be applied on the basis haalanki company ke ve pratinidhi, jin par galat kaam karne or rishwat ke lenden kaa andeh ho, un par bharat kii ore se aaajeevan pratibandh lagaaya jayega

 Horse trading
 
 
 ye wo shabd he jise aapane pichley kuch dinon main tivi par bahes ke dauraan suna hoga, akhbaar main kisi khabar ke hedline main padhaa bhi hoga
 The use of the term has increased in the last few days due to which there has been a political uproar in the formation of government in Karnataka
 lekin iskaa matlab kya hota he or raajnneeti se iskaa aakhir kya lenaa-dena he
 Understand here 
 
 aakhir iskaa matlab kya he
 
 
 ? Actually, horse trading refers to 'selling horses'
 asal main is shabd kii shuruyaat canmbridge dictionari se hui thi
 Around the 18th century, the term began to be used by traders during the sale of horses, but stories related to it that its political meanings were also being extracted
 18veen shatabdi kii shuruyaat yani 1820 ke kareeb jab ghodon ke vyapaaree acchhee nasl ke ghodon kii kharid-farokt karte the or kuch acha paane ke liye kisi tarah ke jugad yaa chaalaaki ke liye jo takanic apanaate the, use hi horse trading kaha gaya
 It is said that during this time, traders used to hide their horses somewhere, tie them somewhere or transport them to some other stables
 phir apni chaalaaki, paison ke len-dein ke dampar sauda kiya jaataa tha
 This is also an anecdote
 
 
 iske alaava puraane jamaane main jab bharat ke vyapaaree apane karindon ko arab desh main ghode kharidne ke liye bhejte the
 So some horses used to die while coming back, but to satisfy their owners, they used to complete the counting by showing the tail of the horses
 yani 100 ghode kharide, to 90 dikhaae baaki 10 kii puunchhe dikhaakar kaha ki wo to mar gaye
 The owners used to believe it
 to baad main karindon ne 100 ke paise lenaa shuru kiya or sirf 90 hi ghode kharide
 Means started taking advantage of 10 horses
 ise bhi horse trading ke kisson se joda gaya
 What is horse trading in politics
 
 
 ?yun to raajnneeti main is shabd kaa koi auchity nahin hota he, lekin pichley kuch samay main iskaa istemaal badha he
 In politics, when politicians change parties, or because of some cleverness, such a game is created that the leaders of the other party support you, then in politics it is called horse trading
 bharat main ise dal-badalanaa, dal-badalu bhi kehete hai
 There is also a law in this country
 kya kahata he anti defections lau (dal-badal nishedh kanoon)? # anusuchee ke duusare paragraph main anti defections lau ke tahat ayogy qaraar die jane kaa aadhaar spasht kiya gaya he
 # If an MLA voluntarily renounces the membership of the party # If he votes against the directive issued by the party or abstains from voting
 # nirdaleey ummidavaar ayogy qaraar de die jaaenge agar vah kisi raajnneetik party main shaamil ho jaaen # ek party kaa vilay duusari party main ho saktaa he lekin iske liye kam se kam party ke do-tihaai vidhayakon kaa vot jaruri he
 Accusations in karnataka-goa-manipur-uttarakhand In recent days, there were allegations of horse trading in Goa, Manipur, Uttarakhand and Karnataka
 congress party ne aarope lagaaya ki bijepi vidhayakon kii kharid-farokt kar rahi he, iske alaava kai vidhayakon ko daraaya dhamkaaya bhi ja rahaa he
 Apart from this, during the Rajya Sabha elections, there were many allegations about cross voting

 This is openly expressed by Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray (MNS), who are considered to be bjp's natural allies in the Aaj Tak program in Mumbai Manthan on Thursday
 raut ne congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii leadership kii jamkar saraahna kii, to raaj thakare ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ko pappu kehane waalon ko unase dar lagane laga he
 In Mumbai Manthan KBJP vs Shiv Sena Sessions, Raut said that there is a huge crowd in Gujarat listening to Rahul Gandhi
 janata kisi ko bhi pappu bana sakati he, rahul gandhi ab pappu nahin hai
 What Rahul Gandhi says, what he does
 kisase miltaa he
 People of this country have started taking interest in him
 iskaa matlab he ki rahul gandhi bhi is desh ko leadership de sakate hai
 Along with Raut, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena leader Raj Thackeray also praised Rahul Gandhi and said that the person whom the BJP used to call pappu-pappu, has become a Jhappu in Gujarat today
 unki raily main jitne log aa rahe hai
 Fearing him, the Prime Minister is going to Gujarat eight to eight times each
 thakare ne kaha ki aap itane saalon tak rahul gandhi ko apamaanit karte rahe or ab vahi aadmi gujarat ja rahaa he, to aapako dar kyon lag rahaa he
 Thousands and millions of people are standing behind the same man, so why feel scared
 bijepi ke itane mukhyamantri kyon ja rahe hai
 This was the first time in recent years that the Shiv Sena and Raj Thackeray have openly praised the Congress vice-president from a public forum
 maharashtra main bijepi ke saath shivasena ke rishte ko dekhte hue sanjay raut kaa bayaan rajya kii siyasat main karpet ke neeche hone vaali halchal kii nishandehi karata he
 This thing is noteworthy and there have been many reports that BJP in Maharashtra is increasing its proximity with the opposition party Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)
 mumbai manthan main hi maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar kii tarif kii or kaha ki pavaar sahab kabhi vikaas ke khilaaf nahin rahe
 Apparently Fadnavis was targeted by Shiv Sena and Uddhav Thackeray
 shivasena lagaataar rajya sarkaar kii nitiyon kaa virodh karti rahi he
 In a way, Shiv Sena is also playing the role of opposition in the state while staying in power with BJP
 chaahe wo kisaanon kaa mudda ho yaa mumbai main baadh kaa, shivasena bijepi or fadanvis sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhane main kotahi nahin karti he
 In the '3 years of Sarkar' session, Devendra Fadnavis did not say anything about an alliance with NCP, but he advised Uddhav Thackeray that what he is doing should be considered as the public will not like it
 bijepi siem kaa yah spasht sandesh tha ki uddhav thakare bijepi kaa jo virodh kar rahe hai wo pasand nahin aa rahaa he
 In the 288-seat Maharashtra Assembly, BJP has 122 seats and Shiv Sena has 63 seats
 duusari ore congress ke paas 42 or ensipi ke paas 41 siten hai
 At the Mumbai Manthan, Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan called for the Congress and NCP to contest elections together
 maharashtra main pichhali sarkaar ensipi or congress kii thi
 In such a situation, praising the Shiv Sena for the Congress is a sign of Uddhav Thackeray's moves on the political board of Maharashtra
 isi kaarykram main sanjay raut ke bayaan par tanj kasate hue bijepi netaa vinod taavade ne kaha ki inhone upi chunaav main bhi aisi bhavishyavaanee kii thi
 On this Raut said that she proved to be wrong in the UP elections, but this alliance will move forward in the politics of this country

 chaar baar ke olympian or purv hockey captain dhanraj pillai kaa maananaa he ki landan olympic main 30 july ko holland ke khilaaf hone vaala pehla match bharat ke liye kaaphi ahm hoga
 Pillai, the miraculous forward of his time, said on the occasion of the 'monet Go for Gold' torch relay, 'I have played four Olympics and we lost the first match three times
 bharat ke liye pehla match jeetna bahut jaruri hoga
 Dhanraj played four Olympics out of which India lost the first match in three
 barceylona main 1992 olympic main pehle match main bharat ko germany ne 3-0 se haraaya
 India had finished seventh and Germany won the title
 sidney main 2000 olympic main bharat ne pehle match main argentina ko 3-0 se haraaya

 athens main 2004 olympic khelon main germany ne pehle match main bharat ko 3-1 se shikast di
 In London, the Indian team is in Group b along with Holland, Belgium, Germany, South Korea and New Zealand
 dhanraj kaa maananaa he ki bhartiya team ko neeli or gulabi turf par khud ko jaldi dhaalnaa hoga
 He said, 'we have a blue pitch in Ludhiana

 Dhanraj said that the Indian team will remain in the top six

 ’unhone yakeen jataayaa ki 27 july ko olympic shuru hone tak tennis star liender pes or mahesh bhupati chayan vivaad ko peeche chhodkar apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karenge

 ' deshbhar ke murgi formon main murgiyon ke halaat par supreme court ne centre sarkaar ko notice jari kar ek hafte main jawaab maanga he
 The matter will be next heard on 5 August
 sarkaar ko ye notice animal welfare board kii yachika par sunwaayee ke baad adaalat ne diya he
 On the pathetic condition of poultry farms, the petition said that the chickens are kept in very poor condition in the farms of the country
 pinjre main unhen is tarah thusa jaataa he ki wo apane pankh bhi nahin failaa sakati
 Even when they are removed many times, they get injured, due to which the quality of eggs along with chickens is also poor
 andon kii quality main kharabi kii ye he vajafunde dene vaali murgiyon ko ferms membetry coging systamame rakhaa jaataa he, jisamen unhen anda dene ke liye A4 sies paper ke baraabar hi jagah di jaati he
 The battery cogging system was removed by the European Union long ago, but it is still running in India
 saath hi supreme court ne centre sarkaar ko 2010 or 2013 main die gaye animal welfare board ke suzav ko lagu karne kaa aadesh sunaaya
 Also, in this petition, an appeal has been made to transfer the cases running in many high courts
 bhartiya chikitsa parishad (MCI) ne embibies, bidies or snatakottar chikitsa paathyakramon ke liye saajha pravesh pariksha yojit karne ke prastaav ko manjuuri de di or apni siforishein kendriya swasthya mantralay ko bhej di hai
 According to Health Ministry officials, the government had sought mci's opinion on the proposal, on which MCI approved the proposal in its general meeting on October 1
 mantralay ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha, 'emsiai ne ek oktober ko apni aam sabha kii baithak main prastaav kaa samarthan kiya
 Under the current policy, every state government conducts its own entrance examinations
 nijee medical kalege sanghathan or dimd vishvavidhyalay bhi apni saajha pravesh parikshaayen yojit karti hai or icchhuk ummidavaar sabhi pravesh parikshaon main baithte hai
 He further said that under this proposal, there will be a Common Entrance Examination for medical candidates from all over the country, which will be very helpful for the students
 emsiai ne bhartiya chikitsa parishad kanoon 1956 main sanshodhan kaa bhi prastaav kiya he taaki ve saajha pravesh pariksha ke bare main tay kar saken
 The initiative towards conducting a Common Entrance Test for Medical Colleges was first taken in 2009 when Ketan Desai was the head of MCI
 input:bhashaa Amrapali's projects do not seem to ease the misery of customers who buy flats
 unhen abhi flats hasil karne ke liye or lanbaa intjaar karnaa pad saktaa he
 In fact, in the current economic situation, buyers of the non-residential property of the defaulter company Amrapali are not available because the banks are not ready to give loans for these properties
 dilli main date recovery tribunel (DRT) ke dwaara lagaataar chauthi baar amrapali kii properties ko bechney kaa prayaas safal nahin ho paaya he, kyonki bank in properties ke liye lone dene ko taiyaar nahin hai
 About Rs 8,000 crore is needed to complete Amrapali's residential projects, of which Rs 4,000 crore is to be given by buyers and the remaining amount is to be raised by selling several properties of Amrapali to DRT
 amrapali kii vibhinn site par nirmaan kaary 2015 se hi band ho chukaa he
 The Supreme Court has entrusted the responsibility of completing the residential projects of Amrapali to the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC)
 amrapali ke project main makaan kharidne waalon kii taraf se varisht vakil mihir kumaar ne bataaya ki bainkon main badhate fanse karj, gaiyr nishpadit parisampatti (NPA) or real estate bazaar main kharaab centement kii vajah se difalter builder amrapali ke flaton kaa nirmaan puraa hone kii prakriya main deree ho sakati he
 Despite clear instructions from the Supreme Court, it is still a dream for Amrapali buyers to get a house key as the debt recovery tribunal has failed to sell Amrapali's properties
 kumaar ne kaha, 'makaan kharidaar agar apane hisse kaa puraa paisa jamaa kar den to bhi projects ko puraa karne ke liye jaruri fund kaa 50 fisadi hissaa hi nikal paaegaa
 The drt's attempts to sell non-residential projects of Amrapali fail repeatedly because the banks are not giving loans to such prospective buyers when they have to pay cash within 15 days
 to kisi vyakti ke paas agar 100 karod rupaya hoga bhi to vah amrapali ke project kyon kharidega, jabaki bank lone kii madad se vah aise duusare 10 project kharid saktaa he
 With no signs of success in the recovery of Amrapali's loans, now homebuyers are also reluctant to give the remaining amount for the loan of the flat
 pichley ek dashak se amrapali ke vibhinn project main kareeb 46,000 home boyrs apane flats ke pajeshan milane kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 More buyers have already paid 80 to 90 per cent of the flat cost
